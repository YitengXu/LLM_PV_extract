    , Accepted 26th April 2020First published on 27th April 2020Abstractα-Fe2O3 nanotubes are exceptional one-dimensional transition metal oxide materials with low density, large surface area, promising electrochemical and photoelectrochemical properties, which are widely investigated in lithium-ion batteries, photoelectrochemical devices, gas sensors, and catalysis. They have drawn significant attention to the fields of energy storage and conversion, and environmental sensing and remediation due to the increase in the global energy crisis and environmental pollution. Many efforts have been made toward controlling the morphology or impurity doping to improve the intrinsic properties of α-Fe2O3 nanotubes. In this review, we introduce the synthesis methods and physicochemical properties of α-Fe2O3 nanotubes. The fabrication conditions, which are important for the physicochemical properties of materials, are also listed to describe the synthesis processes. Furthermore, the development and breakthrough of various applications in batteries, supercapacitors, photoelectrochemical devices, environmental remediation, and sensors are systematically reviewed. Finally, some of the current challenges and future perspectives for α-Fe2O3 nanotubes are discussed. We believe that this timely and critical mini-review will stimulate extensive studies and attract more attention, further improving the development of the α-Fe2O3 (hematite) nanotube structure.
1. Introduction
The rapidly growing demand for clean energy has driven researchers to widely investigate new materials with improved electrochemical/physicochemical properties.1–5 As the key technology for the possibility of fully utilizing visible light, various semiconductor materials have drawn great research interest.6–8 Transition metal oxides have attracted considerable scientific and technological attention, due to their intrinsic catalytic properties, unique crystal structure, and tunable surface morphologies.9 Most of them have been widely used in electrochemical energy conversion and storage, electrochemical sensors, and photocatalytic hydrogen production, which are considered as alternative sustainable renewable energy and environmental technologies.10–12
The α-Fe2O3-based nanomaterials display exceptional characteristics,13 including (i) attractive photo(electro)catalytic properties that provide alternatives to precious nanomaterials for numerous energy conversion reactions; (ii) superior energy storage capabilities; (iii) reduced operation cost of industrial processes due to their high earth abundances; (iv) long-term sustainability due their low cost, availability, comparatively low toxicity, wider chemistry, and chemical reactivity. The advantages of α-Fe2O3, such as low toxicity, low cost, high availability, and high theoretical specific capacity, make it one of the materials with the greatest potential for energy and environmental applications. In the energy storage field, α-Fe2O3 can react with six moles of Li, leading to theoretical gravimetric and volumetric lithium storage capacities of about 1006 mA h g−1 and 5331 A h L−1, respectively, which exceed the theoretical values of graphite in terms of both weight (372 mA h g−1) and volume (837 A h L−1).14 The remarkable electrochemical capacities and superior electrical conductivity make it better for clean and reliable energy storage devices.15 Besides, the bandgap of hematite is only about 2.0–2.2 eV, which ensures that it can absorb over half of the visible light (>600 nm), harvest up to 40% of the incident solar spectrum energy, and is stable in most aqueous solution (pH > 3).16 However, α-Fe2O3 nanomaterials experience a large volume change during the charge/discharge process, leading to unstable electrochemical properties.17 The unmatched hole diffusion length and light penetration depth and the poor conductivity are also drawbacks of α-Fe2O3 materials, causing the fast recombination of electron–hole pairs inside the semiconductor.18 As such, the structure of the α-Fe2O3 nanotubes was designed to overcome the above-mentioned issues.
In comparison to the bulk material, various morphologies of α-Fe2O3, such as nanowires, nanorods, nanotubes, nanorings, and nanoporous structures,19 have been investigated to enhance the cyclic stability and rate capability for energy storage or catalytic performance for energy conversion. While these nanostructures are attractive for practical applications, the nanotube geometry provides a greater surface area than others for a given diameter, as the tubes possess both inner and outer surfaces. Furthermore, unlike the case of wires, the structural integrity of the tubes can be maintained even if the wall is thinned to a few nanometers. For applications such as photocatalysis and chemical sensing, thin walls help the charge carriers to remain close to the surface and take part in surface reactions.20,21 The vertically aligned nanotube geometry is particularly useful as it could help to improve the optical properties of the material and provide facile pathways for the conduction of charge carriers along the length to the substrate region. Compared to the bulk material, a nanotube array of length 20 μm, pore diameter 100 nm, and wall thickness 20 nm could enhance the surface area by about a thousand times.22 Among the mentioned structures, the nanotube structure could improve the electrochemical performance due to the minimized volume change from hollow structures, shorten the path of photogenerated carriers and increase the efficiency of photoelectrons.23 In particular, highly ordered vertical nanotubes, prepared by facile anodic oxidation, with extremely large specific surface area as compared to dense planar film, have been considered as a promising structure to improve the properties in energy storage, adsorption and desorption of gas molecules, and photodegradation.24,25 α-Fe2O3-based nanocomposites have also been doped to enhance the conductivity and stability of materials. Some impurity elements (such as Ti, Si, and C) can be doped into the α-Fe2O3 structure, causing great enhancement in the catalytic performance (i.e. photocurrent).26,27
A great number of studies on the synthesis of α-Fe2O3 nanotubes have been reported, including hydrothermal, template-assisted, electrospinning, and electrochemical anodization methods.12,28 Similar to α-Fe2O3 nanotubes, TiO2 nanotubes possess unique chemical and physical properties such as chemical inertness, gas sensitivity, large surface area, biocompatibility, high photocatalytic and electrochemical activities.29,30 The synthesis methods of TiO2 nanotubes can be used for reference and adopted in the synthesis of α-Fe2O3 nanotubes. Among the synthetic methods, hydrothermal synthesis is an easy-operation and highly productive route for preparing the α-Fe2O3 nanotube structure. Sacrificial templates (e.g. ZnO) can be used for the preparation of α-Fe2O3 nanotubes because they can be easily removed via chemical etching or combustion, leaving the resultants with a pre-set porosity and reversely duplicated morphology. α-Fe2O3 nanotubes synthesized by electrospinning have been investigated extensively due to the simple and efficient processes for achieving well-defined one-dimensional nanostructures with designed components.31 Alternatively, vertically ordered α-Fe2O3 nanotubes can be grown on an iron substrate through direct electrochemical anodization processes.32
Recently, many significant breakthroughs on α-Fe2O3 nanotube materials have been made for improving their electrochemical, photoelectrochemical, magnetic, and other properties. The α-Fe2O3 nanotube structure, including its synthesis, characterization, and properties, is the focus of this review. We summarize the fabrication methods for α-Fe2O3 nanotubes and then review their properties in structure, composition, electrochemistry, photocatalysis, and magnetism. We also discuss their energy and environment-related applications, including Li-ion batteries, solar-light-driven water splitting, supercapacitors, water treatment, and sensors, from the aspects of function-oriented structure design and control.
2. Synthesis
2.1 Electrochemical anodization
Electrochemical anodization, due to its simplicity, reliability, high controllability, and low cost, is a powerful method for the large-scale production of α-Fe2O3 nanotube materials.33–36 Self-organized metal oxide nanotubes, including aluminum oxide, titanium dioxide, zirconium oxide, niobium pentoxide, hafnium oxide, copper oxide, iron oxide, tantalum pentoxide, vanadium oxide, tungsten oxide, zinc oxide, and multinary metal oxide nanotubes, can be fabricated on the surface of suitable metal foils via the electrochemical anodization strategy.22 Among them, owing to the unique structure and special properties, α-Fe2O3 nanotube layers or nanotube arrays on the iron substrate have recently attracted much scientific interest. Jagminas et al. reported that upon adjusting the anodization conditions to an optimum, highly ordered pore array structures can be grown directly on the iron foil surface.37 The morphology change from nonporous to nanotubular was further illustrated by LaTempa et al. at higher anodization temperature as shown in Fig. 1a–c.38Fig. 1d and e show that the length of the as-synthesized α-Fe2O3 nanotube arrays is approximately 3 μm. However, the drawback of the α-Fe2O3 nanotubes synthesized by anodization is that the material would become fragile when the length is increased to a certain extent. After anodization, the nanotube maintains the amorphous structure that has to be annealed to fabricate high-crystalline metal oxide nanotubes.

The anodization of iron was performed in the two-electrode system with iron foil as the anode and platinum foil as the cathode. Ethylene glycol (EG) and NH4F were utilized as the main electrolyte. Firstly, the iron oxide layer was formed based on the activation of the voltage applied to the cell. The nanotubes can be formed in fluoride-bearing electrolytes via chemical dissolution reaction with the slight balance of four simultaneous processes.39 Specifically, as shown in Fig. 2, the changes in the current response, instantaneous resistance, and differential resistance (dV/dI) show four distinct stages during the formation of the nanotube array structure. During stage I, the ohmic current response is the major response, due to the iron foil acting as a native resistor when a voltage is applied through it. Meanwhile, the accompanying differential resistance remains almost constant (Fig. 2b), showing that there are no obvious changes in the physical structure of the electrode. During stage II, resulting from a sudden increase in the resistance, a sharp decrease in current was observed, which was caused by the formation of a thin oxide layer. Corresponding to the above discussion, the synthesis of the initial oxide layer can be described by eqn (1). As the result of the onset of the pitting of oxide layer by F−, which leads to a reduction in the mass of the more resistive oxide, the increase, and reduction of subsequent current and differential resistances is instantaneous during stage III (eqn (2)). The subsequent current increase and reduction in both figures observed during stage III were due to the onset of the pitting of the iron oxide layer by the F−. During stage IV, there is a constant increase in the current with a constantly growing rate of the nanotubes due to the constant applied potential.40 2Fe + 3H2O = Fe2O3 + 6H+ + 6e−(1) Fe2O3 + 12F− + 6H+ = 2[FeF6]3− + 3H2O(2)

The anodization experiment was carried out in a jacketed reactor connected to an enclosed water bath. The schematic diagram of the anodization set-up used to fabricate α-Fe2O3 nanotubes as shown in Fig. 3. The effects of the experimental conditions, which include reaction time, calcination temperature, atmosphere, and voltage, on the fabrication process are further discussed as follows.41

(1) Electrolyte. 
The water content and concentration of F− in the electrolyte play an important role in the fabrication of α-Fe2O3 nanotubes. When the water content of the electrolyte increased to above 6 vol%, the granular structure was obtained, which is similar to the nanoporous morphology.42 It appears that a higher F− concentration and water content make α-Fe2O3 nanotubes with thinner walls. Habazaki et al. reported that there was a thin barrier layer between the porous layer and iron substrate ranging from 35 to 191 nm, with a reduction in the water content from 1.5 to 0.1 mol L−1.43 Furthermore, Fig. 4a shows that the thickness of the anodic film decreased with the increase in the water content. Fig. 4b shows that the wall thicknesses and the growth rates of the nanotubes are dependent on the water content of the electrolytes. The growth rate increased from 1.1 nm s−1 at 1.5 mol L−1 water to 4.2 nm s−1 at 0.1 mol L−1 water at a constant current density of 50 A m−2. The water content influences the conductivity of the EG solution, causing the alteration of the mobility of F− ions in the electrolyte and affecting the formation of α-Fe2O3 nanotubes. The conductivity of the EG solution increased linearly from 600 mS cm−1 (2% water) to 960 mS cm−1 (14% water).

(2) Anodization voltage and temperature. 
The morphology of α-Fe2O3 nanotubes was affected greatly by the applied voltage, as shown in Fig. 4c. Nanotubes with diameters ranging from 40 to 55 nm can be obtained in the anodization potential range from 30–50 V, where there is a linear relationship between the voltage and nanotube diameter. As shown in Fig. 4d, the voltage-time responses in the anodizing process reveals that the formation voltage is largely dependent upon the water content. It is worth mentioning that with controllable voltage, the diameter of the nanotubes is proportional to the voltage.43
The anodization temperature essentially controls the length and the diameter of α-Fe2O3 nanotubes.38Fig. 5a demonstrates that the length of the nanotube increases with the temperature, as does the diameter of the nanotube until saturation at ∼50 °C when the nanotube forms. LaTempa et al. reported that the minimum anodization temperature for preparing α-Fe2O3 nanotubes is affected by the F− concentration and water content of the electrolyte.38 The results demonstrate that the minimum anodization temperature for preparing iron oxide nanotubes at a potential of 50 V in EG + 0.2 wt% NH4F + 2.0% water for 180 s is 75 °C, but only 45 °C in EG + 0.5 wt% NH4F + 3.0% water for 180 s.

(3) Annealing atmosphere. 
The influence of annealing atmospheres on the α-Fe2O3 nanotubes fabrication is further discussed. The XRD profiles for the α-Fe2O3 nanotube electrode annealed at 400 °C for 30 min in different gas atmospheres (air, Ar, N2, a mixture containing 95% Ar and 5% H2) are shown in Fig. 5b. The XRD patterns were observed predominantly from the (104) and (110) planes of the α-Fe2O3 phase in all samples made in different annealing atmospheres. However, the (220) and (511) diffraction peaks, which correspond to the magnetite (Fe3O4) phase, were relatively more prominent in N2 and Ar gas atmospheres as compared to the other two electrodes. Annealing in N2, Ar, or H2 atmospheres is beneficial for the chemical reduction of the α-Fe2O3 phase to the Fe3O4 phase.38,41


(4) Anodization time. 
The anodization time is also an important factor for the fabrication process. As indicated in Fig. 6, the surface morphology could change from the nanopore structure to the nanotube structure with the increase in anodization time.44 Additionally, the average pore size was measured to be approximately 39 nm for 60 min, 31 nm for 90 min, and 43 nm for 120 min, respectively, as shown in the SEM images (Fig. 6). Momeni et al. reported that by increasing the anodizing time, the length of the nanotubes increased.39

2.2 Electrospinning method
The electrospinning method is suitable for the construction of a one-dimensional nanostructure. In the electrospinning process, typical precursor solutions (e.g. iron salt and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)/polyethylene oxide (PEO)) are pumped through a nozzle with a high applied voltage relative to grounded aluminum foil (acts as a collector) to form an electrically charged jet of solution.45 For the fabrication of α-Fe2O3 nanotubes, the product obtained after the electrospinning process has to be annealed at a high temperature. Eid et al. fabricated α-Fe2O3 nanotubes derived from PVP/iron acetate nanofibers by the electrospinning method through annealing in the air.46 Zhang et al. discussed the effect of the spinning solution composition on the α-Fe2O3 morphology, including nanotubes, nanorods, and nanobelts, by changing the precursor weight ratio between Fe(NO3)3 and PVP.47 An experiment scheme for the process with the corresponding expected nanostructures by the electrospinning method is shown in Fig. 7. Liu et al. synthesized original and La-doped α-Fe2O3 nanotubes by electrospinning with Fe(NO3), La(NO3)3, N-dimethylformamide, and ethanol as the precursors.48 To obtain the highly crystalline α-Fe2O3 nanomaterial, the as-collected electrospun nanofibers were dried to evaporate the residual solvent, and calcined at high temperature (higher than 500 °C). The as-synthesized material has excellent electronic and gas sensing properties, providing helpful direction on synthesizing the controllable α-Fe2O3 nanotubes. However, the yields by the electrospinning method are very limited. There are still many problems that need to be solved in the large-scale preparation of α-Fe2O3 nanotubes by the electrospinning method.

2.3 Templating method
The templating method is also applied as a useful route for preparing one-dimensional nanostructures. Guo et al. used ZnO nanowire arrays as the sacrificial template for the synthesis of α-Fe2O3 nanotube arrays.49 The ZnO template, fabricated by thermal evaporation on different substrates (including sapphire wafer, Si wafer, ITO/glass), was immersed in a dilute FeCl3 solution to form the ZnFe2O4 nanotubes. Lin et al. further synthesized α-Fe2O3 nanotubes on the nickel foam substrate via chemical transformation of the ZnO nanowire template to obtain a conductive additive-free and binderless electrode for supercapacitors.50 For the templating method, the residual element from the template is an issue that can be easily ignored, which may affect the properties of the α-Fe2O3 nanotubes, especially the catalytic performance. Other disadvantages include the complicated fabrication process and the destruction of tubes that may occur during the fabrication process.
Interestingly, Chen et al. reported porous Fe2O3 nanotubes with controllable pore structure and phase junction by molecular layer deposition (MLD) and atomic layer deposition (ALD) approaches using carbon nanofibers (CNFs) as a template.51 MLD and ALD have been considered to be appealing technologies for constructing nanocoating on various substrates via a bottom-up approach with molecular or atomic level control, due to their self-limiting nature, excellent conformality, chemical selectivity and low reaction temperature.52–54 Iron tert-butoxide and EG were used as the precursors for MLD. Two novel MLD procedures were designed to prepare porous Fe2O3 nanotubes with tunable pore structure and phase junction. The organic fractions of the obtained Fe-hybrid MLD films act as soft templates to generate nanopores in nanotube walls and also play a key role in the formation of the phase-junction. Under annealing, the Fe-hybrid films/CNFs can convert into porous Fe2O3 nanotubes with controllable pore size and α–γ phase junction. Azevedo et al. reported the synthesis of double-walled α-Fe2O3 nanotubes using porous anodic alumina templates via selective chemical etching and the Kirkendall process.55 The approach is based on the electrodeposition of metallic iron nanowires in porous alumina templates, followed by a selective chemical etching, nanoscale Kirkendall effect, fast oxidation and out-diffusion of the metallic core structure during thermal annealing.
2.4 Hydrothermal method
Due to its simplicity and high yield, the hydrothermal process is commonly used for the crystal formation and the growth of the metal oxide nanotube structure.56 Fu et al. coated α-Fe2O3 nanotubes on the micro-fiber interferometer by a simple and reliable hydrothermal method.57 FeCl3 and NH4H2PO4 were used as the precursors and were placed in an autoclave for heating at 220 °C for 60 h. Apart from the pure α-Fe2O3 nanotubes, the hydrothermal method is usually applied for the synthesis of α-Fe2O3 nanotube-based composites. For example, Wang et al. proposed a facile one-step hydrothermal method for the synthesis of a three-dimensional (3D) graphene aerogel embedded with hollow α-Fe2O3 nanotubes, which presents as a high-performance anode for the lithium-ion batteries (LIBs).58 Furthermore, α-Fe2O3 nanotubes are usually used as the substrate to support metal oxides or quantum dots. Jiao et al. successfully fabricated the Au/Fe2O3 hollow nanotube arrays on the fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass surface by using a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) reactor and a stainless-steel autoclave.59 The NaNO3, FeCl3, and NaF were dissolved as the precursors. The crystal structure of the product changed from iron oxyhydroxides to α-Fe2O3 after annealing at 550 °C for 2 h. After that, Au nanoparticles were grown on the α-Fe2O3 nanotube array surface by the photoreduction process. Similarly, Duan et al. developed a novel and efficient in situ epitaxial growth strategy to fabricate hetero-nanostructures of Ag3PO4 quantum dots on the external surface of hematite nanotubes (via hydrothermal method),60 by intentionally employing chemically adsorbed phosphate anions on the surface of α-Fe2O3 nanotubes to control the reaction kinetics of phosphate anions and Ag+ ions in aqueous solution. Chen et al. further reported that single-crystalline nanotubes of α-Fe2O3 can be fabricated through the hydrolysis of FeCl3 in the presence of phosphate (at 220 °C), developed from Ostwald ripening of nanocrystallites in spindle- and nanodisk-shaped polycrystalline particles.61 However, for the hydrothermal synthesis of α-Fe2O3 nanotubes, some drawbacks should be taken into consideration, including non-uniformity, short length, and long preparation time. For the synthesis of α-Fe2O3 nanotubes on the metal/carbon substrate to form a 3D electrode, the adhesion strength of the material prepared by the hydrothermal method is lower than that by electrochemical anodization.
3. Physicochemical properties of α-Fe2O3 nanotubes
3.1 Crystal structure and morphology
The physicochemical properties of the α-Fe2O3 nanotubes, including crystal structure, surface energy, surface charge, morphology, and chemical composition, play a vital role in their individual characteristic properties. Reckoning with these facts, in this review, an attempt has been made to analyze the correlation of these physicochemical properties with the specific properties. In other words, it is also an efficient way to improve the properties of α-Fe2O3 nanotubes by controlling the morphology with the size or crystal structure. Based on the characteristics of the corundum structure with a close-packed lattice for the α-Fe2O3 crystal, as shown in Fig. 8, it is quite different for the surface hydroxyl group configuration of the various crystallographic planes such as (100), (110), and (001) of α-Fe2O3.39 No obvious crystalline iron oxide structure was observed in the as-anodized amorphous nanotubes. After annealing at 450 °C in an oxygen atmosphere, the crystal structure was changed from amorphous to crystalline α-Fe2O3. Besides, some small characteristic peaks of Fe3O4 were observed in the XRD pattern, whose intensity was much lower than that of α-Fe2O3. As shown in Fig. 6b, the amount of Fe3O4 increased after the annealing process in an inert atmosphere, due to the creation of oxygen vacancies in the annealing process.

With high surface area, α-Fe2O3 nanotubes show remarkable specific capacitance and charge/discharge rate, which provides smooth and short superhighways to ions and electrons. Besides, compared with nanorods, nanotubes have a hollow structure, which is supposed to effectively alleviate the capacity fading caused by the large volume variation. It is reported that the electrodes made by α-Fe2O3 nanotubes exhibit a much higher reversible capacity than that of nanorods.15 The improved lithium storage performance of the nanotubes can be attributed to the unique tubular structure, which offers enough room for the volume variation during lithiation/delithiation processes and shortens the pathways of lithium transportation. The nanotubes could also keep the structural integrity and exhibit better electric conductivity than that of the nanorods. The detailed microstructures were characterized by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM). As shown in Fig. 8b, the thickness of the nanowalls is approximately 10 nm. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) further affirmed the crystallized α-Fe2O3 structure. The average lattice spacing is 0.37 nm, which corresponds to the (012) plane of α-Fe2O3.24 Jiao et al. reported that the preferential orientation of the [110] axis of α-Fe2O3 nanotubes is the best orientation for photocatalytic applications with good conductivity.59
3.2 Elemental distribution and chemical state
Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) was used to characterize the chemical components of the α-Fe2O3 nanotubes. Fig. 9a shows the presence of iron element at the main energy E = 6.5 kV and oxygen at E = 0.5 kV on the sample surface, demonstrating that the iron oxide film was formed.39 It should be pointed out that there is some F in the samples as contaminants, which results from the F-containing electrolyte. Besides, the chemical state of the element (especially Fe) on the sample surface was investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) using Al Kα radiation (hν = 1486.6 eV).62 The results revealed that the Fe element is mainly present in the +3 oxidation state as shown in Fig. 9b.

In order to better understand the atomic-scale structure, X-ray absorption spectra (XAS) of α-Fe2O3 nanotubes were acquired at the synchrotron light source. Fig. 9c shows the Fourier-transform (FT) magnitude of the Fe K-edge extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra of the α-Fe2O3 electrode in Li2SO4 electrolyte measured at several potentials in a sequence.50 The first FT maximum at about 1.5 Å is attributed to the interaction of central Fe atoms with six coordinated oxygen atoms in the first coordination shell (i.e. Fe–O bond). The second FT maximum located near 2.7 Å corresponds to the nearest Fe atoms between neighboring [FeO6] octahedral sites (i.e. Fe–Fe bond). The interatomic distance of the Fe–O bond progressively decreases with varying the applied potential from −0.8 to 0.1 V, originating from the oxidation state from Fe2+ to Fe3+. A decreased Fe–Fe distance was also observed, indicating a contraction between the [FeO6] octahedral units. Here, Li+ is the primary working species that can intercalate into the 3D mesoporous structures, and the Fe–Fe distance would be expected to increase.
3.3 Electrochemical properties
Due to the special nanostructure, α-Fe2O3 nanotubes show high theoretical specific capacity and half-metallic conductivity, which are beneficial for achieving high performance in the energy storage field with good rate capability. Various electrochemical measurements, such as cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves, galvanostatic discharge–charge cycles, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), were applied to describe the electron transfer properties. For example, the discharge–charge voltage profiles and the reversible capacities of the electrodes of α-Fe2O3 nanotubes and nanorods were determined by Yang et al.,15 as shown in Fig. 10. The discharge–charge voltage profiles show that there is an obvious difference between the nanotubes and nanorods in the discharge and charge processes. Fig. 10c and d indicate that the stability of the nanotubes is better than that of nanorods.

Sarma et al. reported CV results for evaluating the influence of various annealing gas atmospheres on the electrochemical capacitance properties of the α-Fe2O3 nanotube electrodes, as shown in Fig. 11.41 The shape of the CV profiles showed no significant change as the scan rate increased from 20 to 200 mV s−1. The results demonstrate that the α-Fe2O3 nanotubes have good stability, even at high charging conditions. Furthermore, the as-fabricated electrodes annealed at Ar and N2 atmosphere showed larger specific capacitance and better stability than the electrodes annealed in air and O2 atmospheres, as revealed in Fig. 11f, recorded at the scan rate of 200 mV s−1.

The EIS of the α-Fe2O3 nanotube electrode in the frequency range 1000–0.1 Hz at open-circuit potential with AC perturbation of 10 mV are displayed in the form of Nyquist plots comprising semicircle and straight-line regions, as shown in Fig. 12.50Rs is the solution resistance, RW is the diffusion resistance of Li+, and Rct is the charge-transfer resistance across the electrode/solution interface. The constant-phase element (CPE) 1 and 2 represent the interfacial capacitance and the pseudocapacitance from the redox reaction of α-Fe2O3 nanotubes, respectively. As the applied potential shifted positively, the values of Rct and RW notably increased. The gradually increased intercalation of Li+ and decreased available sites of Li+ within α-Fe2O3 nanotubes with increasing applied potential might hinder the diffusion of subsequent Li+, thus resulting in further increased values of Rct and RW.

3.4 Magnetic properties
Magnetic nanomaterials have attracted great interest due to their wide applications in the fields of information storage, color imaging, bioprocessing, magnetic refrigeration, and ferrofluids. Among the iron oxides, α-Fe2O3 shows weak ferromagnetism above the Morin transition temperature (∼260 K) because of spin canting. Furthermore, the oxide transforms into an antiferromagnetic phase with two antiparallel magnetic sublattices lying along the c axis below the Morin transition temperature. A Quantum Design superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) was used to characterize the magnetic properties of α-Fe2O3 nanotubes.63 As shown in Fig. 13a, the magnetic hysteresis loops indicate the presence of a ferromagnetic order for the four samples at room temperature. The variations in the remnant magnetization and coercivity force as a function of the average diameter of nanotubes are presented in Fig. 13b. As the average diameter decreases, the coercivity force increases and the remnant magnetization decreases. The size of the nanofibers plays an indispensable role in the hysteresis properties.46,63 The temperature dependence of the magnetization of samples B1 and B4 was exhibited from the warming and cooling curves obtained from 340 to 10 K in a 25 Oe magnetic field, as shown in Fig. 13c and d. The first magnetic transition at low temperature and the second magnetic transition at high temperature could be ascribed to the small average diameter and greater average diameter, respectively. A model (eqn (3)) was constructed to describe the abovementioned behavior, which indicates that the Morin temperature seems to evolve exponentially with the temperature, as determined through a numerical fit in their study. (3)TBM is the Morin temperature for the bulk material and d is the characteristic size of the magnetic particles. This equation can be applied to evaluate the average size of pure α-Fe2O3 nanocrystals for sizes greater than 15 nm.46

Li et al. reported the fabrication of ZnFe2O4 nanotubes as a nanocomposite to improve the magnetic properties of α-Fe2O3 nanotubes.49 In the tested temperature region (from 3 to 300 K), the zero-field-cooling curve of ZnFe2O4 nanotubes (Fig. 14a) showed a maximum (i.e., blocking temperature (TB)) at about 26 K and the corresponding magnetization at TB reached ∼1.25 emu g−1. The shift of TB to a higher temperature in the ZnFe2O4 nanotube sample indicates the existence of cation inversion in the spinel lattice of ZnFe2O4; i.e., some Fe3+ cations moved from their equilibrium position (B-site) to the A-site, and some Zn2+ cations moved from their equilibrium position (A-site) to the B-site. The magnetic hysteresis loops of ZnFe2O4 nanotubes were measured at both 300 K and 3 K (Fig. 14b), which were well above and below the TB of ZnFe2O4 nanotubes. The appearance of Fe3+ in the A-site will give rise to the ferromagnetic superexchange interactions between Fe3+ in the A-site and B-site. However, such ferromagnetic interactions do not exist in normal spinel ZnFe2O4 because all Fe3+ are located in the B-site, resulting in antiferromagnetic coupling. The magnetic properties of α-Fe2O3 nanotubes were also tested, showing a magnetic phase transition from antiferromagnetic to weak-ferromagnetic (i.e., Morin transition) at ∼235 K under a small external field and a spin-flop transition under a large external field.

4. Applications of α-Fe2O3 nanotubes
4.1 Application in batteries
α-Fe2O3 is considered as a potential electrode material for the LIBs owing to its high theoretical capacities (1004 mA h g−1), low cost, environmentally benign nature, and improved safety.64 Chen et al. synthesized α-Fe2O3 nanotube and nanorod anodes for LIBs through the hydrothermal process.15 The length, inner diameter, and outer diameter of the α-Fe2O3 nanotubes were in the ranges of 150–350 nm, 50–80 nm, and 90–100 nm, respectively. In comparison to the α-Fe2O3 nanorods, the nanotube structure exhibits much better reversible capacity and capacity retention. Specifically, α-Fe2O3 nanotubes retained a good reversible capacity of 1030 mA h g−1 as compared to only 360 mA h g−1 for α-Fe2O3 nanorods measured at a large current density after 60 cycles. The improved lithium-storage capacity of α-Fe2O3 nanotubes is attributed to the exclusive tubular structure, which offers abundant room for the volume variation during the charge/discharge processes and cuts down the routes of lithium transportation.
Veluri et al. combined a sodium alginate binder and a hollow nanostructured α-Fe2O3 material through a simple hydrothermal process.14 The rhombohedral phase nanotubes have an average length of 500 nm and a diameter of 100 nm with a wall thickness of 15–20 nm. The initial discharge capacity and the first charge capacity of the electrode were 1200 and 900 mA h g−1, respectively. After 50 cycles, the electrode had a high capacity of 800 mA h g−1 at 503 mA g−1, and even 732 mA h g−1 at a current rate of 1007 mA h g−1. The results indicate that the interaction between α-Fe2O3 and the alginate binder affected the electrochemical reactivity, reducing the resistance between particles and improving the effective diffusion of lithium-ions in the amorphous matrix. The hydrogen bonding between α-Fe2O3 nanotubes and alginate binder also plays a crucial role in the electrochemical process.
Furthermore, Gu et al. coated a thin carbon layer onto the α-Fe2O3 nanotubes for improving the intrinsic lithium storage performance of α-Fe2O3 nanotubes.65 The diameter of the hollow structure was around 150 nm and the optimized carbon-layer thickness was 0.9 nm. The capacity can reach 1014 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at 1 A g−1, which is much higher than that of pure α-Fe2O3 nanotubes. The thin carbon layer could inhibit volume change during the charge/discharge processes and promote electron conductivity with high structural stability and rate capability. A similar strategy proposed by Xiang et al. not only suggested that the carbon-coated α-Fe2O3 nanotubes (length of 300–400 nm and an outer diameter of 90 nm) are highly promising for practical LIBs applications, but also indicated that the tannic acid-mediated carbon coating method is effective for the functionalization of α-Fe2O3 nanotube materials.66 However, a high content of carbon can reduce the electrode capacity since the theoretical capacity of carbon is much lower than that of α-Fe2O3.65 Accordingly, the superior performance of the α-Fe2O3@C nanotube composites could be attributed to the synergistic effect of their hollow structure branched surface and carbon coating, thus efficiently hindering the diffusion path of Li+ and enhancing the electrical conductivity and inhibiting a large volume change for the whole battery. The relevant reported works on the α-Fe2O3 nanotube materials for the application of LIBs anode are summarized in Table 1.

4.2 Application in supercapacitors
The electrochemical supercapacitor has been regarded as a promising energy storage device with the advantage of high-power density, fast charging speed, and superior cycling stability.71–73 The storage capacities of electrochemical capacitors are hundreds or thousands of times higher as compared to other devices but the energy density of electrochemical capacitors is much lower than batteries.74,75 Obviously, the limitations of energy density, power efficiencies, and specific capacitance restrict the applications of supercapacitors.76 Therefore, much effort has been devoted to improving the performance of supercapacitors at high current densities through the synthesis of the metal oxide nanostructure or the construction of the composite structure for increasing the surface area.
Zheng et al. reported that α-Fe2O3 nanotubes (length of 100 nm and nanotube thickness of 25 nm) exhibited the maximum specific capacitance of 249 F g−1 at a discharging current density of 0.5 A g−1, but only 175 F g−1 at 1 A g−1.77 The specific capacitance had an inconspicuous change when the working temperature was varied from 20 to 60 °C (e.g. 203 F g−1 at 20 °C and 234 F g−1 at 60 °C), which illustrates the durability of the electrodes in a wide temperature range.
Nie et al. synthesized V2O5-doped α-Fe2O3 nanotubes via the electrospinning process by using Fe(NO3)3, PVP, and vanadyl acetylacetonate (VO(acac)2) as the precursor.78 The V2O5-doped α-Fe2O3 nanotubes showed an average diameter of 117 nm, which is smaller than that of pure α-Fe2O3 nanotubes (135 nm). After being compared with the pristine α-Fe2O3 nanotubes, the V2O5-doped α-Fe2O3 nanotube electrode presents a high capacitance of 183 F g−1 at a discharging current density of 1 A g−1, as well as good cycle stability. Lee et al. reported the fabrication of α-Fe2O3 nanotubes/reduced graphene oxide nanocomposites, exhibiting an excellent specific capacitance of 181 F g−1 at a discharging current density of 3 A g−1, which is seven times higher than the pristine α-Fe2O3 nanotubes.79 The above enhancement was attributed to the fast ion diffusion and effective mass transport related to the higher specific surface area, the superior synergistic effect between each constituent and the larger mesoporous structure.79,80
Lin et al. reported the hierarchical α-Fe2O3 nanotube/nickel foam electrode, which was applied as a conductive additive-free and binderless electrode for supercapacitors.50 The diameter of the synthesized α-Fe2O3 nanotube is around 130–180 nm. The polycrystalline structure of tube walls was composed mainly of agglomerated small α-Fe2O3 monocrystalline particles of size about 5 nm and a few ZnO monocrystalline particles left from the template. The α-Fe2O3 nanotubes/nickel foam electrode exhibited satisfactory cycling stability over 3000 cycles and highly reversible charge and discharge features with an excellent specific capacitance of 300.1 F g−1, at specific energy density 75 W h kg−1 and specific power density of 4.5 kW kg−1. The in situ XAS results regarding the charge storage mechanisms of the α-Fe2O3 nanotubes/nickel foam electrodes showed that a Li+-ion can reversibly insert/desert into/from the 3D mesoporous textures between the α-Fe2O3 subunits, depending on the applied potential.
4.3 Photoelectrochemical applications
Since the pioneering demonstration of photocatalytic water splitting by Fujishima and Honda, growing attention and intensive efforts have been paid to the research of semiconductor photoelectrode materials for solar water splitting.81 α-Fe2O3 is considered to be an ideal photoelectrode material candidate for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting because of its natural abundance, good stability, an ideal bandgap of 1.9–2.2 eV for amply visible light absorption, and a suitable band position to drive water oxidation.82,83 The chemical reaction of the PEC system can be described as in eqn (4)–(7).84 The holes stay at the surface of the anode and react with water to produce oxygen. The electrons travel through the external circuit and arrive at the cathode surface to combine with the cations (H+) to generate hydrogen. The schematics are shown in Fig. 15 to provide an understanding of how the thin nanowalls of one-dimensional nanotubes help to reduce the electron–hole recombination losses by improved charge-transport properties. Recent works on the α-Fe2O3 nanotubes material in the application of solar energy conversion are summarized in Table 2. Solar: 2hv → 2e− + 2h+(4) Anode: 2h+ + H2O(l) → 1/2O2(g) + 2H+(aq)(5) Cathode: 2e− + 2H+(aq) → H2(g)(6) Overall: 2hv + H2O(l) → 1/2O2(g) + H2(g)(7)

The fast recombination of the electron–hole pairs results from their low sensitivity, poor selectivity, cycling stability, electrical conductivity, and short hole diffusion length (less than 20 nm), which limits the applications of α-Fe2O3 in the PEC fields. Much effort has been devoted to reducing the possibility of recombination with doping various metal ion species (including Ti4+, Mg2+, Rh3+, Y3+, and Pt4+) or constructing surface co-catalysts such as Pt, Au, Pd, Ag, CdS, and SnO2.32,90 For example, Momeni et al. reported that the PEC activity of α-Fe2O3 nanotubes was enhanced by the decoration of Pd, Pt, and Ag.91–93 The average inner diameter of the nanotubes synthesized by anodization was approximately 50 nm and the wall thickness and the length of the tube were about 20 nm and 4 μm, respectively. The photocurrent densities of Pd/α-Fe2O3 nanotubes (300 μA cm−2), Pt/α-Fe2O3 nanotubes (220 μA cm−2), and Ag/α-Fe2O3 nanotubes (295 μA cm−2) samples at 0.4 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) were more than 2 times higher than that of pristine α-Fe2O3 nanotubes (105 μA cm−2).
Mushove et al. reported the PEC performance of α-Fe2O3 nanotube with different morphologies by the anodization method, including single, multilayered, and wave-like nanotube arrays.40 As shown in Fig. 16a, the normalized diffuse reflectance spectra indicated that these three morphologies have similar optical properties, while the absorption onset occurred at ∼600 nm and an additional absorption at ∼450 nm. The optical characteristics of the nanotube films are consistent with α-Fe2O3 exhibiting a direct bandgap of ∼2.4 eV as determined from Fig. 16b and an indirect bandgap of ∼1.9 eV. While both bandgaps are thermodynamically sufficient to drive the water oxidation reaction (1.23 eV), the incident photon to current efficiencies (IPCE) for the nanotube samples, shown in Fig. 16c, suggest that the indirect bandgap is not utilized during water oxidation. This poor utilization has been attributed to charge trapping associated with the lower energy electronic transition. As shown in Fig. 16c, the IPCE value of the wave-like α-Fe2O3 nanotube arrays at 350 nm is ∼3 times and ∼12 times higher than that of the single-layer nanotube arrays and the multilayer nanotube arrays, respectively, which was attributed to the effective electrochemical surface area and the presence of layer interfaces. Besides, the flat band potential of Au/α-Fe2O3 nanotubes synthesized by Jiao et al. is 0.72 V, as shown in Fig. 16d,59 which is of great importance for achieving lower onset potential for the hydrogen evolution.

The primary scientific and technological objective of photocatalysis and PEC is focused on developing novel photocatalysts that could improve the utilization of solar irradiation.94 The PEC performance of TiO2 nanotubes, α-Fe2O3 nanotubes, α-Fe2O3 nanoparticles, and nanoporous α-Fe2O3, were compared under the illumination of simulated solar light. The α-Fe2O3 nanotubes with a thickness of 2 μm, a pore diameter of 40 nm and a minimum wall thickness of 10 nm, presented the maximum photoconversion efficiency of 0.51% and 0.60% with the illumination of visible and simulated solar light at 0.3 V.95
To meet the challenges resulting from poor thermal stability, highly crystalline α-Fe2O3 nanotube arrays with an average length of 2 μm and high density of 2.5 × 107 tubes per cm2 were synthesized, which could survive extended calcination temperatures up to ∼800 °C without any sintering.88 Owing to the well-oriented tubular structure, high light absorption, and rich surface defects, this α-Fe2O3 nanotube photoanode exhibited significantly improved PEC activity for water oxidation, and the photocurrent was up to 1.2 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V (vs. RHE). The decoration of FeOOH/NiOOH dual-cocatalysts not only caused a negative shift in the onset-potential (170 mV), but also increased the photocurrent density to 2.0 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V (vs. RHE), which is the highest value among the reported hematite nanotube photoanodes. Based on the Kubelka–Munk function and UPS valence band spectra (Fig. 17a and b), the calculated bandgaps and the work functions of α-Fe2O3 nanotube-550 °C and α-Fe2O3 nanotube-750 °C were well illustrated. The conduction band positions of α-Fe2O3 nanotube-550 °C and α-Fe2O3 nanotube-750 °C were 0.73 and 1.17 eV (vs. NHE), respectively, clearly indicating that α-Fe2O3 nanotube-750 °C exhibited the more positive valence band position (Fig. 17c). Owing to the well-defined crystallinity, α-Fe2O3 nanotube-750 °C possesses the regular atom structure with only surface defects, which facilitates the positive shift of the valence band position. Based on the above results, it was concluded that high-temperature calcination not only promotes high crystallinity, but also enhances the light absorption capacity of the α-Fe2O3 nanotubes. ZrO2-induced hematite nanotubes (outer diameter of 100 nm and a wall thickness of 20 nm) are another case for affirming that high-temperature calcination is the key to improving the crystallinity of hematite and thus enhancing charge carrier transport and absorption coefficient. They exhibited a photocurrent density of 1.50 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE, which is the highest record among hematite nanotube photoanodes without cocatalysts.89

In electrocatalysis, the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) plays a crucial role in the energy conversion field, especially in the fuel cells.96,97 The search for an alternative catalyst to Pt-based materials for the ORR in alkaline media has never stopped. Xue et al. reported that α-Fe2O3 nanotube arrays were fabricated by a facile two-step electrochemical anodization method and employed as an efficient 3D self-supported ORR electrode.98 The nanotube structure shows an average pore diameter of 35 nm and a thin wall thickness of around 15 nm. Due to the highly ordered open-top architecture, the α-Fe2O3 nanotube array electrode exhibited high ORR catalytic activity with an onset potential of −0.39 V (vs. Hg/HgO) and high current density of 6.95 mA cm−2. The results show that the ORR exhibited quasi-reversible diffusion-controlled reaction characteristics and a well-defined four-electron pathway. As the crystal structure transformed from α-Fe2O3 to Fe3O4, the ORR activity was frustrated and the electron transfer number decreased from 3.91 to 3.79. Accordingly, this 3D α-Fe2O3 nanotube array electrode has the potential for application as efficient and low-cost noble metal-free electrodes for alkaline fuel cells. Though high ORR performance has been achieved, the development of the α-Fe2O3 nanotubes-based electrode towards electrocatalysis is still in its infancy and there are still many challenges for further investigations. Potential strategies are suggested to improve the ORR activity of α-Fe2O3 nanotubes, including phase transformation, defect engineering, surface modification, doping, and compounding. Furthermore, due to the unique features of α-Fe2O3 nanotubes, they may serve as multifunctional substrates or provide highly active sites for excellent performances in oxygen evolution, hydrogen evolution, CO2 reduction, and nitrogen reduction reactions.
4.4 Application in water treatment and environmental remediation
In the heterogeneous photocatalytic process, α-Fe2O3 nanotubes can be excited by light irradiation, which promotes electrons from the valence to the conduction band and triggers a series of oxidation–reduction reactions involving the excited electrons and generated holes. The subsequent charge separation/migration/transfer processes lead to the production of highly reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as hydroxyl radicals and superoxides on the catalyst surface, which can completely mineralize organic contaminants through advanced oxidation processes (AOPs). However, the poor electron mobility and catalytic efficiency of the α-Fe2O3 nanotube nanostructure remain to be further improved.
In terms of increasing the intrinsic photocatalytic activity of α-Fe2O3 nanotubes, Chen et al. reported porous hematite nanotubes with α–γ phase junction for enhanced charge separation and photocatalytic properties.51 The well-defined nanotube-like morphology presents a wall thickness of about 20 nm. The porous structure and phase-junction significantly improve the mass diffusion and charge separation efficiency, leading to drastically increased photocatalytic activity for the photo-Fenton reaction. Taking the photodegradation of Rhodamine B (RhB) as a model reaction, the porous α-γ Fe2O3 nanotubes heterostructure produced by the two-step MLD exhibited the highest photocatalytic activity, which was more than a 6.5-fold and 20-fold enhancement as compared with the nonporous pure α-Fe2O3 nanotubes and commercial α-Fe2O3 nanoparticles, respectively.
The design of a heterostructure or nanocomposite is another effective strategy for tuning the photocatalytic activity of α-Fe2O3 nanotubes. Duan et al. developed an in situ epitaxial growth strategy to fabricate Ag3PO4 quantum dots on the external surface of hematite nanotubes (60–80 nm in diameter and 150–200 nm in length, hexagonal phase Fe2O3).60 In terms of the charge carrier migration for the Ag3PO4/α-Fe2O3 nanotubes heterostructure, the first-principles DFT simulations in the CASTEP software package were performed as shown in Fig. 18a–c. The results indicated that the hematite surface has a more positive Fermi level value than the Ag3PO4 (311) surface. Once Fe2O3 (113) and Ag3PO4 (311) were brought into tight contact, electrons flowed from the Fe2O3 (113) surface to the Ag3PO4 (311) surface after attaining the same Fermi level. In terms of the photocatalytic mechanism for the Ag3PO4/α-Fe2O3 nanotube heterostructure, the photo-excited electrons accumulated on the conduction band of the Ag3PO4 tend to migrate into the valence band of the hematite nanotube and recombine immediately with the holes, due to the high-quality hetero-interfaces following a Z-scheme mechanism. Both holes and ˙OH could be generated in this system, which is used as the main ROS for efficiently degrading RhB. In this way, the recombination of electrons on α-Fe2O3 nanotubes and holes on Ag3PO4 would be efficiently suppressed, resulting in the optimized redox potential in the photocatalytic system and the greatly enhanced photocatalytic degradation performance. Similarly, the α-Fe2O3/Bi2WO6 nanotube heterostructure was reported, which is beneficial for hindering the recombination of photo-induced electrons/holes, and thus improved the photocatalytic degradation of RhB.99 Lei et al. reported that the CdS nanorods anchored on α-Fe2O3 nanotube arrays (diameter of 60 nm and length of 1.83 μm) displayed high photocatalytic activity for the decomposition of methylene blue, methyl orange, and phenol under visible light illumination.100

Impressively, Lee et al. investigated the photocatalytic degradation of organic compounds based on the doping or modification of stainless-steel nanotubes (SSNT).101,102 The SSNT surface was composed of Fe2O3 and Cr2O3 and showed a hexagonal pore structure with 75 nm diameter and its band alignment between Fe2O3 and Cr2O3 resulted in a low e−/h+ recombination. Photocatalytic oxidation employing SSNT@Ti along with hydrogen peroxide as an oxidant exhibited the highest photo-Fenton degradation rate. The nanocomposite of SSNT with graphene quantum dots (SSNT@GQD) was used to degrade phenanthrene under visible light in persulfate-based AOPs. Sulfate radicals, superoxide radicals, and photogenerated holes were the key reactive species in this process (Fig. 18d). The SSNT@GQD/persulfate system showed a high figure of merit (78.7) and quantum yield (4.64 × 10−5 molecules per photon), indicating that it has excellent potential for practical photocatalytic remediation applications.
4.5 Application in sensors
Semiconductor metal oxide-based gas sensors have diverse applications such as in environmental monitoring, agriculture, medical diagnosis, aerospace industries, and mobile applications because of their small size, low cost, and easy operation.103 Many pioneering works about semiconductor metal oxides, such as SnO2, WO3, ZnO2, and TiO2, have been reported recently.25 Among them, α-Fe2O3 is one of the multifunctional n-type materials with wide applications in sensors. The α-Fe2O3 nanotube material can be applied in the gas-sensing of acetone, NO, O2, H2S, H2O2 and other species, and deals with the response and recovery time, the detection limit or selectivity of the materials.104,105 A bifunctional sensor of NO and O2, based on a hybrid α-Fe2O3 nanotube-chitosan film was fabricated by Gong et al.104 In this case, the chitosan was used as an immobilization matrix. The concentration ranges for NO and O2 were from 5.0 × 10−8 to 1.25 × 10−6 mol L−1 and from 2.5 × 10−7 to 6.0 × 10−6 mol L−1, respectively.
The gas sensors made of α-Fe2O3 nanotube arrays (average diameter of 346 nm) were also utilized for detecting acetone with the response and recovery times of about 3 and 5 s at 240 °C, respectively.106 The α-Fe2O3 nanotube-based sensors have the advantages of low operating temperatures, short response and recovery time, and low detection limit. To date, significant efforts have been made to improve the performance by making composites of lanthanides, Al2O3, ZnO, Au, and other materials on the α-Fe2O3 structure, or heteroatom-doping the α-Fe2O3 structure; the results are summarized as shown in Table 3. The intrinsic catalytic properties of α-Fe2O3, the unique structure of the nanotubes, and the synergistic effects between the substrate and doping content play a vital role in the sensing performance.

Kim et al. reported Au-decorated α-Fe2O3 nanotubes on SiO2/Si substrates, which displayed the sensitive and selective detection of acetone in an atmosphere of 50% relative humidity.107 The synthesized α-Fe2O3 nanotubes were vertically and highly ordered with uniform diameters of 70 nm. The patterned recognition of the Au-decorated α-Fe2O3 nanotubes was performed by principal component analysis, as shown in Fig. 19, with exposure to various gases (acetone, ethanol, CO, H2, NH3, C7H8, and C6H6). It was explicitly observed that most gases were well separated with excellent selectivity. Au decoration significantly enhanced the response of α-Fe2O3 nanotubes to acetone at 350 °C and the response to acetone was 2.4 times higher than the response to ethanol, the counterpart target gas.

Al2O3-doped α-Fe2O3 nanotubes were synthesized and utilized for detecting ethanol, with the response value of Al2O3-doped α-Fe2O3 nanotubes to 50 ppm ethanol being 41.8 at the operating temperature 240 °C, which is much higher than that of pure α-Fe2O3 nanotubes.111 The SnO2/α-Fe2O3 nanotubes and In2O3/α-Fe2O3 heterostructure nanotubes were also fabricated in previous work, although the performances of these materials are lower than that of Al2O3-doped α-Fe2O3 nanotubes.109,112 Furthermore, Mahmoudian et al. reported the synthesis of the α-Fe2O3/polyaniline nanotubes composite as an electrochemical sensor for uric acid detection.113 The results demonstrated that the increase in the conductivity of α-Fe2O3 in the presence of polyaniline nanotubes could improve the catalytic performance of the α-Fe2O3/polyaniline nanotubes composite as compared to the pure α-Fe2O3 nanoparticles. From differential pulse voltammetry, a linear working range for the concentration of uric acid between 0.01 and 5 mM, with a LOD of 0.038 mM (S/N = 3) was obtained. The sensitivity of the linear segment was 0.433 μA mM−1.
5. Conclusions and perspectives
The development of α-Fe2O3 nanotubes materials with unique properties and architectures has led to great advances in the energy and environmental field. This minireview has highlighted fundamental and experimental progress for the preparation of α-Fe2O3 nanotubes toward several state-of-the-art applications including electrochemical energy storage, photoelectrochemical energy conversion, and environmental remediation and monitoring. Intensive researches have greatly deepened our mechanistic understanding of the electrochemical/PEC/sensing behavior of α-Fe2O3 nanotubes, which serves as a useful guideline for the design of α-Fe2O3 nanotube-based materials with high performances.
We highlight several remaining challenges in the fundamental studies relevant to the α-Fe2O3 nanotubes that need to be carefully addressed in the future. The first challenge is how to simplify the technology for the large-scale production in the industry with extending practical operability and how to precisely and efficiently control the nanotube geometry by varying the operational parameters (e.g. anodic potential) to obtain optimized properties. Secondly, since the modification is key for improving the performances of α-Fe2O3 nanotubes, we need to explore more methods for modification and take full advantage of the self-organized nanostructure. The third challenge is to understand the underlying mechanisms and pathways of the electrochemical/PEC reaction on the α-Fe2O3 nanotubes, where the primary task is to identify the surface-adsorbed species, intermediates, and active sites, and further guide the structural design of advanced materials. Furthermore, the stability of α-Fe2O3 nanotube-based electrodes is uniquely challenging (especially in acid media), not just for electrochemical energy conversion and storage but also for light-absorbing applications.
We propose the following research opportunities to potentially address the above issues and challenges in this area, resulting in further performance improvements and ultimately widespread applications of α-Fe2O3 nanotubes:
(1) The synthesis procedures are expected to be simplified and engineered for large-scale and low-cost production. Even though significant progress in the shape-controlled synthesis of α-Fe2O3 nanotubes has been achieved in the last decade, demands for even higher performance and lower costs call for the urgent development of advanced synthetic approaches that enable rational and precise structural tuning. One of the big research opportunities is to scale the yield of α-Fe2O3 nanotubes from the current laboratory level to the industrial level.
(2) Modification and nanocomposite design strategies need to be further investigated for increasing the performance of α-Fe2O3 nanotubes. Except for the conventional methods, ALD appears to be an option to homogenously and precisely coat the α-Fe2O3 nanotube layers from the bottom to the tube mouth, resulting in many advanced functionalities of the newly prepared nanotube layers. Nevertheless, further optimization of the ALD process toward coatings and inner fillings is required.
(3) Recently, single-atom catalysts with atomically dispersed metals on solid supports represent the ultimate limit of nanoscale catalysts that bridge the gap between heterogeneous catalysts and homogeneous catalysts to deliver the combined merits of both. In this regard, α-Fe2O3 nanotubes, with high surface area and abundant anchoring sites, could be utilized as a potential substrate to support the single atoms, while the metal–support interactions and coordination environment may be systematically tuned.
(4) It is highly desirable to develop advanced characterization techniques that enable the direct in situ probing of reaction intermediates along with advanced DFT calculations and facile approaches for discovery and breakthrough in α-Fe2O3 nanotubes. Further development of the computationally-assisted design and preparation of α-Fe2O3 nanotubes is urgently needed for the prediction of the structure–activity relationship and the reduction of the synthesis attempts. In situ characterization techniques, such as in situ Raman, XPS, XAS, SEM, and TEM, would be very helpful for understanding the growth of α-Fe2O3 nanotubes and reaction mechanism.
(5) Through self-assembling inorganic, organic, metallic, and magnetic nanoparticles into or onto the α-Fe2O3 nanotubes as composites with a broad spectral response to visible light, high quantum efficiency, and stabilizing properties, applications could be widened. For example, α-Fe2O3 nanotubes with low toxicity have great potential for development in biomedical directions, especially in photodynamic therapy. Besides the unique light-absorbing and response properties, α-Fe2O3 nanotubes could also be separated by a magnetic field.
(6) It is necessary to design and construct α-Fe2O3 nanotube-based materials that can maintain the initial activity/performance under real practical operations. Several available strategies are proposed to address this problem, such as the introduction of carbon or polymer coatings, inert metal oxide coating, atomic ordering, and elemental doping.
