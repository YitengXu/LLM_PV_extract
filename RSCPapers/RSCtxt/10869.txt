    , Accepted 3rd January 2023First published on 6th January 2023AbstractPt-based catalysts are generally used for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in batteries and fuel cells but due to their high price, low abundance, and poor stability, alternative materials are needed. Herein, we investigate the electrocatalytic ORR activity of a Ti2N nitride MXene in alkaline medium. First, we synthesize the Ti2N MXene via oxygen-assisted molten salt etching and delamination via tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAOH). We then perform characterization using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The XRD analysis shows clear etching of the Al from the parent MAX phase with a shift in the (002) peak to lower 2θ values. SEM images show visible accordion-like morphology in the clay and lateral flake sizes of roughly 5 μm. The MXene catalyst undergoes a four-electron (4e−) ORR catalysis and follows a reaction mechanism different from Pt/C (Tafel slope of 69.3 mV dec−1vs. 94.8 mV dec−1). The new ORR catalyst has an onset potential of 0.70 V vs. RHE and better ORR stability compared to Pt/C and Ti3C2 carbide MXene with 81.97% current retention over 15 hours of chronoamperometry. We use in situ Raman spectroelectrochemistry to uncover the mechanisms of ORR in real-time. We find that the subsurface played a significant role in the ORR catalysis and that the adsorption of O2 on the basal plane was the rate-determining step. These results expand the applications of MXenes in electrocatalysis, which in turn will accelerate the discovery of cost-effective and efficient catalysts for metal-air batteries and fuel cells.
Introduction
The increasing energy demand and depleting supply of fossil fuels have urged the global shift to renewable sources for energy production. According to Sustainable Development Goal 7, the energy share of renewable sources, such as solar, wind, and hydrothermal, should significantly increase by 2030; however, renewable energy production is intermittent. Therefore, research devoted to renewable energy storage and conversion technologies and applications has spiked in the recent years since these systems will play a pivotal role in meeting energy demands as we transition away from fossil-based fuels. Examples of these renewable energy conversion technologies include fuel cells and metal-air batteries, both of which heavily rely on the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) chemistry—a reaction that is has sluggish kinetics.1–3 Additionally, the overpotentials required to catalyze the ORR are high because of the reaction and device parameters, which Zubair et al. collectively stated in their review article.4 These reaction parameters include the electron transfer efficiency, activation energy of the catalyst, electrode–electrolyte interface, and entrapment of ions, gas molecules, or reaction intermediates.4,5 The device parameters include wire and electrode resistance, solution concentration, and electrode catalyst morphology, surface area, and collection efficiency.4,5 The most active catalyst for ORR is the noble metal Pt.6 Unfortunately, this noble metal catalyst is expensive and has low earth abundance;2,6,7 which significantly constrains the widespread commercialization of fuel cells and batteries. Further, Pt-based catalysts suffer from poor stability and carbon corrosion in acidic, alkaline, and oxidative environments.8–10 Therefore, there is a need for alternative ORR catalysts that are less expensive and more stable than noble metal-based catalysts but exhibit comparable catalytic activity.
MXenes, an emerging class of two-dimensional (2D) transition metal carbides and/or nitrides, have attracted considerable attention in the fields of energy storage,11–15 catalysis,16–18 sensors,19 electronics,20 and biomedicine21 due their unique properties. MXenes are expressed by the general formula Mn+1XnTx (n = 1–4) wherein M is an early transition metal (Ti, Mo, V, Nb, etc.), X is either carbon and/or nitrogen, and Tx is surface functional groups (typically –O–, –F, and/or –OH).22 MXenes are synthesized through the selective etching of the A layer (Al, Si, Sn, etc.) from the parent MAX phase.16 These materials possess high electronic conductivity due to the presence of transition metals, high specific surface area from their layered structure, hydrophilicity from their surface termination groups, and tunable morphology from their synthesis methods.8,23,24 With different transition metals, they can exhibit different work functions.4,8 Among the 30 experimentally synthesized MXenes thus far,25 most of the works on ORR2,7,23,26–28 have focused on utilizing Ti3C2 carbide MXene, the first MXene that was reported in 2011.25,29,30 This carbide MXene functions well as a cocatalyst capable of increasing the overall electronic conductivity and long-term durability.6,7,28 However, nitride MXenes have been predicted to have higher electronic conductivity compared to carbides.31–34 Ostadhossein et al. theoretically studied the effect of surface termination groups on Ti4N3 MXene to enhance the ORR catalytic activity, and reported substantially lower overpotentials for both –O- and F-terminated Ti4N3 compared to their carbide counterparts.34 However, despite their potential, there is no experimental report on the use of nitride MXenes as catalysts, cocatalysts, or supports for ORR.
Herein, we report the electrocatalytic ORR activity of Ti2N nitride MXene in an aqueous alkaline medium. The Ti2N is synthesized via an oxygen-assisted molten salt etching technique and delaminated using tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAOH). We investigate the ORR activity and stability of the Ti2N and compare the results against those for Ti3C2 carbide MXene and the benchmark catalyst, Pt/C. Though the benchmark catalyst exhibits better activity, the Ti2N shows higher stability and different kinetics and outperforms the carbide MXenes for ORR catalysis in terms of activity, stability, and kinetics. We also use in situ Raman spectroelectrochemistry to uncover the mechanisms of ORR in real-time. We find the subsurface to be active for ORR and the adsorption of O2 on the basal plane to be the rate-determining step. We are expanding these new findings to more nitride MXene materials to accelerate the discovery of cost-effective and efficient ORR catalysts.
Experimental methods
Etching of Al from the Ti2AlN MAX phase
Ti2AlN MAX phase (NanoChemAZone, >98%) was added to a 59:29:12 weight% molten salt fluoride (MSF) mixture of KF (Alfa Aesar, 99%), LiF (Alfa Aesar, 325 mesh, 98.5%), and NaF (Alfa Aesar, 99%), respectively, in a 1:1 weight ratio. This mixture of MAX + MSF was ground in a mortar and pestle and transferred to a crucible boat. The crucible was then placed in a tube furnace (CM Furnaces Inc. 1730-20 HT) with Ar (Airgas, Ultra High Purity) flowing through at a rate of 360 mL min−1. The furnace was heated up to 550 °C under Ar flow at a ramp rate of 10 °C min−1, then held at this temperature for 5 h. Halfway through these 5 hours, the Ar flow was stopped and the furnace was sealed to the environment. After 5 h, the furnace was cooled to 450 °C over the course of 12 min and held at this temperature for another 40 min. After this step, the furnace was then allowed to cool to room temperature. Once the reactor was cooled, the furnace was opened and the crucible boat was extracted from the furnace. The resulting material, molten salt-treated Ti2AlN MAX phase (Ti2AlN–MST), was then collected and stored for future usage.
Synthesis of multilayer Ti2N MXene
The Ti2AlN–MST material was acid washed in 4 M formic acid (Sigma Aldrich, 95%) following the formula of 20 mL of acid for every 0.5 g of Ti2AlN–MST. The material was slowly added to the acid and left to stir for 30 min. The solution was then filtered onto a 0.1 μm polycarbonate membrane with ultrapure H2O until pH 6 was achieved.
Delamination of Ti2N MXene
The wet sample from membrane filtration was scraped into 10 mL tetramethyl ammonium hydroxide (TMAOH, Sigma Aldrich, ACS reagent) and stirred for 4 h. Following the stirring, the solution was transferred to a centrifuge vial and bath sonicated for 30 min. The solution was then filled to 50 mL with water and centrifuged at 3500 RPM (1962 RCF) for 30 min followed by decanting. This same process was repeated until neutral pH was reached. The vial was then filled with water to the 10 mL mark, shaken, and left to rest for 45 min to allow any remaining MAX to precipitate. The final supernatant was filtered onto a Celgard 3501 membrane and dried at 50 °C under vacuum overnight. The resulting powder was collected and stored in a vial under an inert atmosphere.
Delamination of Ti3C2 MXene
The Ti3C2 MXene was delaminated in a similar manner as previously reported.22,35 In short, the as-purchased Ti3C2 MXene (NanoChemAZone 99 wt%) was intercalated using DMSO by stirring for 18 hours. The mixture was then centrifuged at 3500 RPM for 30 minutes (decanting the supernatant and replacing it with water between each centrifuge) until all DMSO was removed, then, the precipitate was membrane filtered and dried in a vacuum oven.
Characterization
The crystalline structure of the material at each stage of the synthesis was analyzed using X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku MiniFlex 6G). Surface morphology was analyzed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Tescan LYRA-3 Model GMH Focused Ion Beam Microscope, courtesy of Texas A&M University Materials Characterization Core Facility (RRID:SCR_022202)). Raman spectroscopy (Renishaw inVia Qontor) equipped with a 532 nm laser, an 1800 lines per mm grating, and a 50× long objective lens, was used to analyze the structure of the material. Reflectance measurements were conducted on a Bruker INVENIO R equipped with a diamond crystal Platinum ATR accessory, to gain insights into the surface chemistry and functional groups. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Omicron XPS system with Argus detector courtesy of TAMU Materials Characterization Facility) was used to further analyze the surface and elemental compositions. For the XPS survey scans, analysis was performed with the CAE as 100 eV and the dwell time as 0.05 s. For high-resolution scans, XPS analysis was performed with the CAE as 40 eV and the dwell time as 0.05 s, with three spectra collected to be averaged out for the overall scan. For the X-ray 558 control, the emission current was set to 15 mA and the anode current to 15 kV, making the X-ray power 225. For the CN10 neutralizer settings, the emission current was set at 10 μA and the beam energy at 2 eV. The aperture was set at 3 or 5, making the aperture coefficients a and b 304.3 and 0.91, or 39.2 and 0.43, respectively.
Electrochemical measurements
All electrochemical tests were performed in a three-electrode cell (Fig. S1†) that was connected to a WaveDriver 200 EIS Bipotentiostat (Pine Research Instruments, USA). The working electrode was prepared by dispersing 4 mg of the synthesized Ti2N in a mixture of 400 μL ethanol (Acros Organics, 99.5%) and 16 μL of 5% Nafion in ethanol (Fuel Cell Store). The catalyst ink was sonicated for 1 h. Then, 20 μL of the ink was loaded onto a polished glassy carbon electrode (GCE, Pine Research Instruments, USA) and dried in a vacuum oven at 40 °C for at least 30 min. Ti3C2 carbide MXene and 10% Pt/C (Sigma Aldrich) were prepared similarly for ORR benchmark comparisons. Graphite rod was used as the counter electrode in all electrocatalytic experiments. The ORR studies were investigated in 0.1 M KOH (Fisher Chemical, ACS reagent) (pH = 13), with Hg/HgO as the reference electrode. The current was normalized to the electrode surface area of 0.2 cm2. All potentials were converted to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)23,36 following eqn (1): ERHE = EHg/HgO + 0.098 + 0.059pH(1)
For the ORR measurements, the electrochemical cell was continuously purged with O2 gas (Airgas, Ultra High Purity). The rotating ring disk electrode (RRDE) and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves for ORR were collected at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1. The electron transfer number, n, and the % H2O2 yield were obtained from RRDE and were calculated using eqn (2) and (3), respectively. The Id is the disk current, Ir is the ring current, and N (0.38) is the current collection efficiency of the Pt ring. (2) (3)
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) tests were conducted before and after ORR at a scan rate of 20 mV s−1. Chronoamperometry (CA) and chronopotentiometry (CP) were used to test the stability of the catalysts in ORR systems.
The electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) was obtained by running CV tests on the double layer region (from 0.78 V vs. RHE to 0.94 V vs. RHE) at varying scan rates of 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, and 150 mV s−1. The double layer capacitance, Cdl, was determined from the slope of the linear fit of the current densities at a certain potential (0.86 V vs. RHE, in this case).37 The specific ECSA in m2 g−1 was then calculated by the following eqn (4): (4)
The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed at 0.78 V vs. RHE using a frequency range of 100 kHz to 1 Hz and a 10 mV amplitude. The Nyquist plot was fitted to an equivalent circuit using the Circuit Simulation analysis in the Aftermath software from PINE potentiostat.

In situ Raman spectroelectrochemistry
The in situ/operando Raman spectroelectrochemistry (Renishaw inVia Qontor) was performed using a screen-printed electrochemical cell (Gamry) (Fig. S2†) connected to a PGSTAT302N Autolab potentiostat, (Metrohm, USA). About 5 μL of the Ti2N ink was loaded onto the carbon substrate and 20 μL of O2-sat'd 0.1 M KOH was added, covering all working, counter (carbon), and reference (Ag/AgCl) electrodes. For ORR measurements, LSV curves were taken from 1 to 0 V vs. RHE at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 The Raman spectra were obtained at a voltage increment of 0.1 V. Two laser powers, 10%, and 50%, were used to characterize the surface and the bulk of the catalyst, respectively.
Results and discussion
Morphological and surface characterization of Ti2N MXene
We applied a series of characterization techniques to confirm the successful synthesis of the Ti2N MXene. To this end, we used X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Raman spectroscopy, and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy to characterize the Ti2AlN MAX and Ti2N MXene as shown in Fig. 1. The XRD of the delaminated sample (Fig. 1a) indicates successful etching of the Al from the MAX phase, as evidenced by the shift in the (002) peak to a lower 2θ angle. The (002) peak in the spectra occurs at ∼9.6° with the (004) reflection occurring at ∼18°. The (002) location corresponds to the interlayer spacing (d-parameter) and c-parameter values of 0.920 nm and 1.84 nm, respectively. These findings are in good agreement with previous reported data for this material.11,16,38 The broad peaks from 35–65° arise from disorders in the 2D structures, including termination group formation and material stacking, which is also observed with other MXene materials.39–41 SEM imaging of the multilayer Ti2N (Fig. 1b) clay depicts clear exfoliation of the Al from the parent MAX phase, as shown by the accordion-like morphology. Raman spectroscopy (Fig. 1c) shows the 5 main Raman active modes for the MXene material at 150, 265, 420, 610, and 700 cm−1, consistent with the reported Raman modes for Ti2N.16 We used FTIR spectroscopy (Fig. 1d) to determine the surface functional groups, which were predominantly –OH, as evidenced by the broad peak centered around 3300 cm−1 and the narrow peak at approximately 1400 cm−1. The peak centered around 1600 cm−1 can be attributed to N–H stretching due to the exposure of the sublattice N atoms to the adsorbed water from the environment. The implication of this peak can be interesting from a catalytic perspective, meaning that the subsurface might be accessible for catalytic reactions.

XRD was obtained using a zero-diffraction silicon plate with a well. Raman spectroscopy was obtained using a 532 nm laser with 1800 lines/mm grating and a 50× long objective lens. FTIR spectroscopy was obtained using a diamond ATR crystal. 
The XPS spectra of the delaminated Ti2N are presented in Fig. S3.† The Ti 2p peak in Fig. S3a† can be separated into a single doublet: the Ti 2p3/2 and the Ti 2p1/2 peaks of Ti4+ and Ti3+ combined. The greater intensity of the Ti4+ peaks compared to those of Ti3+ is consistent with the observed presence of a passivation layer protecting the bulk material from oxidation. It is noteworthy that the bulk material is stable and shows no signs of oxidation as indicated by XRD (Fig. 1a), SEM ((Fig. 1b), and Raman (Fig. 1c). There was no Al detected in the XPS survey scans, indicating successful etching of the Al from the Ti2AlN MAX phase and subsequent formation of the Ti2N MXene.
Ti2N MXene for oxygen reduction reaction
After successfully confirming that we synthesized phase pure Ti2N nitride MXene, we then investigated its electrocatalytic ORR activity. A CV test was performed in Ar- and O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH electrolytes at a scan rate of 20 mV s−1. This approach would allow us to probe the activity of the Ti2N catalyst. As seen in Fig. 2a, a redox peak is present at ∼0.6 V vs. RHE in the O2-saturated electrolyte but not in the Ar-saturated electrolyte. This peak is attributed to the reduction of oxygen on the surface of the Ti2N, which suggests that Ti2N is active for ORR in this environment.7,42 Generally, inert gas (Ar or N2) is purged into the electrolyte to remove the dissolved oxygen; and so, the absence of the ORR redox peak that is observed in the Ar-saturated electrolyte is expected. We determined the specific ECSA of the Ti2N MXene to be 0.190 m2 g−1 based on the CV analyses (see Fig. S4, S5† and 5c). These results lay the foundation for investigating Ti2N nitride MXene for ORR catalysis.
 Fig. 2  (a) CV curves of Ti2N in Ar-saturated (orange) and O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH (green) electrolytes. The curves were obtained without rotation. The current was normalized to the electrode surface area of 0.2 cm2. (b) Nyquist plot of Ti2N from 100 kHz to 1 Hz in 0.1 M KOH at a voltage of 0.78 V vs. RHE, the amplitude of 10 mv, and the rotation rate of 1600 rpm. Insets: randles circuit and zoomed-in portion of Nyquist plot. The EIS data were analyzed using the PINE software by fitting the semi-circle to an equivalent circuit. 
Next, we investigated the electrode/electrolyte interface using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The resulting data shown in the form of Nyquist plot (Fig. 2b) shows that the surface phenomenon of the Ti2N MXene resembles that of a Randles equivalent circuit that consists of an active electrolyte resistant (Rs = 40.7 Ω) in series with the parallel combination of the double-layer capacitance and the charge transfer resistance (Fig. 2b inset).
We then studied the ORR activity of the Ti2N catalyst in alkaline medium. We compared the results to the most studied MXene, Ti3C2,1,8 under the same conditions. The activity was measured using polarization curves obtained from LSV analysis (Fig. 3a–d). Fig. 3a presents the ORR polarization curves of the Ti2N and Ti3C2 MXene catalysts which were obtained at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 and a rotation speed of 1600 rpm. The Ti2N MXene outperforms the carbide Ti3C2 MXene – with the more positive onset and half-wave potentials of 0.70 V vs. RHE and 0.56 V vs. RHE, respectively, and a greater kinetic current density of 1.61 mA cm−2 (while Ti3C2 MXene has an onset and a halfwave potential of 0.58 and 0.50 V vs. RHE, respectively). To further study the reaction kinetics of ORR in the alkaline medium, the rotation rate was varied from 400 to 2400 rpm to reduce the thickness of the diffusion layer;43,44 hence, a higher diffusion-limited current is expected. This can be seen from the RRDE curves in Fig. 3b. The Tafel slopes of Ti2N are plotted in Fig. 3c in which a decreasing trend is observed as the rotation rate increases. The Tafel slopes that are determined from this plot range close to 60 mV dec−1, suggesting that the adsorption of oxygen and/or intermediates on the catalyst is the rate-determining step (RDS) for ORR.2,45,46 The ORR can proceed through either a 2e− (O2 + H2O + 2e− → HO2− + OH−, HO2− + H2O + 2e− → 3OH−) or a 4e− (O2 + 2H2O + 4e− → 4OH−) pathway.1 It is important to note that the formation of peroxide in fuel cells will result in the corrosion of the cell, which will lower its overall performance.2 Thus, the targeted peroxide yield should be as low as possible. The selectivity (expressed by the number of transferred electrons per O2 mol, n) of the favored reaction pathway the ORR undergoes is calculated using RRDE measurements. This could also be obtained through the Koutecky-Levich (KL) equation.47 However, the KL equation is only valid for single-step reactions whereas ORR is often a multistep process.47,48 For this reason, the selectivity was presented through the parameters n and % H2O2, which were determined using eqn (3) and (4), respectively, and are in Fig. 3d. At 0.4 V vs. RHE, the n value is 3.65 with a peroxide yield of 17.65%, which indicates 4e− selectivity. This is preferred for fuel cell and battery applications, wherein an efficient electron transfer process is required.1

The current density was normalized to the electrode surface area of 0.2 cm2. (c) Tafel analysis and (d) peroxide yield and the number of electrons transferred per O2 mol (n) of Ti2N MXene. 
Furthermore, we compared the ORR kinetics and stability of the Ti2N in 0.1 M KOH to Ti3C2 and the benchmark catalyst Pt/C. Fig. 4a shows the ORR kinetics of the three studied catalysts through their Tafel slopes. The Tafel slopes for benchmark catalysts 10% Pt/C and Ti3C2 are 94.8 mV dec−1 and 108.9 mV dec−1, respectively, and are in good agreement with reported values from literature.28,49–52 A Tafel slope close to 120 mV dec−1 suggests that the RDS in the ORR is associated with the first electron transfer.2 More importantly, Ti2N exhibits a different RDS as evidenced by its low Tafel slope of 69.3 mV dec−1.2 In general when the Tafel slope is close to 60 mV dec−1 the RDS may be the Tafel step. Nevertheless, the lower Tafel slope value of Ti2N implies more favorable reaction kinetics.7,28 Furthermore, the ORR stability of the three catalysts was tested through 4.5 h chronoamperometric measurements (at 0.1 V vs. RHE) and is shown in Fig. 4b. The Ti2N MXene shows superior stability with 89.3% current retention, whereas Ti3C2 shows a current attenuation of 54.53% and Pt/C was only able to retain 47.19% current. Overall, our experimental findings indicate that the new Ti2N nitride catalyst is shown to possess better ORR kinetics and stability than Ti3C2 and Pt/C in the alkaline medium. These results pave the way for the investigation and development of nitride MXenes as cost-effective, efficient, and viable alternatives for expensive noble-metal electrocatalysts for ORR.
 Fig. 4  (a) Tafel analysis at 1600 rpm and (b) CA curves of Ti2N, Ti3C2, and 10% Pt/C in 0.1 M KOH. The data show that Ti2N nitride MXene has more favorable kinetics and is more stable than the benchmark Pt/C and Ti3C2 carbide MXene. The Ti2N is able to maintain nearly 90% of its current after 4.5 hours of ORR, which is nearly double that for Pt/C. 
We also investigated the long-term stability of the Ti2N catalyst in ORR. The results of the stability tests performed in 0.1 M KOH are shown in Fig. 5. Chronoamperometry (CA) (Fig. 5a inset) was performed at 0.1 V vs. RHE for 15 hours. Fig. 5a depicts the stability of the nitride MXene with 81.97% current retention. Furthermore, LSV, ECSA, and Raman spectra for the Ti2N MXene were taken after 15 h CA as shown in Fig. 4b–d. After the 15 h CA test, the polarization curve in Fig. 5b shows a negligible change in the onset and half-wave potentials. The 0.09 mA cm−2 decrease at about 0.35 V vs. RHE is attributed to the 13% decrease in the ECSA based on Figs. S6† and 5c. Nonetheless, the Raman spectra in Fig. 5d corroborate the excellent structural stability of the MXene catalyst as the main characteristic vibrational modes at 150, 265, 420, 610, and 700 cm−1 as for Ti2N are retained after the 15 hours of CA measurement. These results are far better than those for the benchmark Pt/C electrocatalyst and indicate the superior ORR stability of the Ti2N nitride MXene compared to other electrocatalysts (Table S1†).

Mechanistic insights via in situ Raman spectroelectrochemistry
Lastly, we investigated the ORR mechanism and the RDS using the in situ Raman spectroelectrochemical technique. The Raman spectra were obtained using 10% laser power to characterize the catalyst–electrolyte interface, and 50% laser power to penetrate the subsurface of Ti2N. When the laser intensity increases, the laser peak power is increased along with the penetration depth.53 Therefore, we can manipulate the laser power to probe deeper into the material.
The characteristic spectrum of the Ti2N nitride MXene has been reported to be in the region between 100 to 800 cm−1.38 The Ti2N spectra in Fig. S7† were used to monitor any structural instability of the catalyst and no such changes were evident during the ORR, which indicates good structural stability. As discussed earlier, 2e− ORR in alkaline medium yields HO2− as the intermediate – assigned at ∼1150 cm−1 (shaded in gray in Fig. 6a and d).54–57 For both 10% (Fig. 6a) and 50% (Fig. 6d) laser powers, this peak was not observed. This further suggests that the ORR undergoes a 4e− pathway and the rate-determining step is most likely the adsorption of O2 (O2 + * → *O2) on the Ti2N surface.54 This corroborates with the Tafel slope values and the computed number of transferred electrons, in the previous section.
 Fig. 6  
in situ Raman spectroelectrochemistry of Ti2N in O2-sat'd 0.1 M KOH. The spectra are obtained using (a–c) 10% laser power and (d–f) 50% laser power. The spectra were smoothed using the Savitzky–Golay filter (smooth window: 35 (for a, d) and 65 (for b, e), polynomial order: 3) from the WiRE software. It should also be noted that the spectra in (a–b, d–e) were normalized and offset vertically for better representation of peak shifts if any. Actual data points are presented in (c) and (f). 
The coupled peaks at approximately 3210 cm−1 and 3431 cm−1 depict the associated OH on the surface.58 It can be observed that with a decrease in the applied voltage, from 1 to 0 V vs. RHE, the overall intensity of the spectra at 3431 cm−1 increases when probing the surface with low laser power (Fig. 6b–c). The opposite trend is observed when we probe deeper into the material with high laser power (Fig. 6e and f). In general, an increase in the intensity of a certain peak is typically indicative of an increase in the electron density, and consequently, the decrease in the peak intensity corresponds to a decrease in the electron density.22,35 With this idea, the increase in the intensity of the OH peak when probing the surface corresponds to an increase in the density of adsorbed OH (Fig. 6c). However, it does not follow the LSV trend, suggesting the lack of correlation between the top surface and the electrocatalytic electron transfer. Namely, there is no change in the behavior of the intensity when the onset potential is reached or when the reduction occurs. This indicates that the passivation layer is most likely not the source of electrons for ORR, but rather the space for H2O and OH− adsorption and desorption, respectively.59,60
In contrast, we observed a trend similar to that for the LSV when we probed deeper into the material and accessed the subsurface (Fig. 6f). This suggests a correlation between the subsurface and the electron transfer in the ORR catalysis.61 We observed three subregions and all are consistent with the LSV data. There is a decrease in the OH intensity when the potential is swept from 1.0 to 0.7 V vs. RHE (see region I), before the ORR onset, indicating a decrease in the density of the adsorbed H2O. We also observed a change in the slope when the ORR onset potential is reached (0.6 to 0.3 V vs. RHE), suggesting the reaction of the adsorbed H2O (see region II). The slope changes again once the catalyst reaches its higher overpotentials (0.3 to 0 V vs. RHE) (see region III). The decreasing trend in the intensity observed in the subsurface with the increase in ORR activity suggests that electrons are transferred from the subsurface to the surface during ORR catalysis. In other words, to tune the ORR activity on MXenes, one would need to manipulate the electron transfer from the subsurface to the surface. This can be accomplished by changing the electronic structure, such as replacing a Ti with a different transitional metal or inserting both X atoms, C and N, in the structure. Overall, these results revealed the important role of the subsurface in ORR catalysis, and provide foundational knowledge to tune the electrocatalytic activity of MXenes and 2D materials in general.
Conclusions
Herein, we report the first experimental ORR activity from a nitride MXene catalyst. Specifically, we report on the ORR activity, stability, and kinetics of Ti2N nitride MXene in aqueous electrolytic solutions under varying rotation speeds. Ti2N MXene was synthesized using the oxygen-assisted molten salt fluoride reaction method with a large lateral size, high surface area to volume ratio, and excellent structural stability. When tested under ORR conditions, the Ti2N catalyst outperformed the benchmark Pt/C in terms of stability and the most studied MXene Ti3C2 in terms of both activity and stability. In addition, the ORR Tafel slopes of the Ti2N nitride MXene indicate faster reaction kinetics compared to both Pt/C and Ti3C2 carbide MXene. From the in situ Raman spectroelectrochemical measurements, we found that Ti2N catalyzes ORR via a 4e− route and that the RDS is the O2 adsorption on the basal plane. Furthermore, the results from the in situ Raman spectroelectrochemical measurements reveal the subsurface of Ti2N MXene to be the key contributor of electrons for ORR catalysis. These results also provide a framework for the exploration of nitride MXenes for metal-air battery and fuel cell technologies. Future investigations on this catalyst should involve modifying the surface (i.e., heteroatom doping and/or surface functionalization) and controlling the interaction between the top surface and subsurface to further tune the ORR activity.

The data show that Ti2N nitride MXene has more favorable kinetics and is more stable than the benchmark Pt/C and Ti3C2 carbide MXene. The Ti2N is able to maintain nearly 90% of its current after 4.5 hours of ORR, which is nearly double that for Pt/C.
