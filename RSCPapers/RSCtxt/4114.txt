    , Accepted 11th June 2021First published on 12th June 2021AbstractA tellurium-doped carbon nanomaterial (Te-MC(P)) was newly developed by the soft-templated carbonization of the PAN-b-PBA copolymer with poly(3-hexyltellurophene). Te-MC(P) was characterized with various characterization methods, including the nitrogen sorption isotherm measurement (BET), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), which reveal that the Te atoms are homogeneously dispersed in the three-dimensional hierarchical, graphite-like mesoporous carbon matrix with a Te doping level of 0.27 atom %. Based on the characterization results, the electrocatalytic ability of Te-MC(P) was evaluated by using a symmetrical dummy cell test with both Co(bpy)32+/3+ (bpy = 2,2′-bipyridine) and I−/I3− redox electrolytes as counter electrodes (CEs). The Te-MC(P) CEs showed remarkably lower charge-transfer resistance (Rct) values by approximately 10 times in the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurement, compared to the counterpart platinum (Pt) and the tellurium-based material (Te-MC(A)), prepared with a telluric acid precursor that has a lower Te doping level of 0.15 at%. As a result, the excellent electrocatalytic ability of Te-MC(P) resulted in the improvement of photovoltaic performance. The power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of Te-MC(P)-based dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) were 12.69% for the Co(bpy)32+/3+ redox electrolyte with the SGT-021 porphyrin dye and 9.73% for the I−/I3− redox electrolyte with the N719 ruthenium dye. Furthermore, Te- MC(P) CEs exhibited remarkable electrochemical stability in the two redox electrolytes. These results could suggest that the Te-MC(P) CE is one of the best promising alternatives to Pt CEs as a low-cost, highly stable and efficient electrocatalytic CE for practical applications.
1. Introduction
During the past three decades, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have been widely studied as a promising alternative to silicon-based solar cells because researchers have recognized and are aware of the hidden academic, industrial and environmental advantages of DSSCs, such as the low-cost, facile fabrication process and acceptable energy generation.1–3 One of the important advantage is that the DSSCs have wide applicability to various research fields. This is attributed to the fact that DSSCs have a conventional electrochemical cell structure of a two-electrode system with a liquid electrolyte and mimic photosynthesis in plants.1,4,5 Therefore, many organic and organometallic molecules,6–8 polymers,9 inorganics,10,11 carbon materials12,13 and substrates14,15 were applied as corresponding components of DSSCs, and various photophysical, computational, and electrochemical methods were used to analyze their properties.16,17 As a result of these monumental studies and efforts, the DSSC is considered to be one of the important fields for the application and evaluation of various materials and as an application platform for newly developed materials.4,18,19 Furthermore, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of DSSCs can reach close to 15% after Kakiage et al. and Ji et al. reported the remarkable efficiencies of 14.34% and 14.2%, respectively.20,21
DSSCs can be generally divided into four components: the sensitizer (dye), metal oxide semiconductor, electrolyte and counter electrode. Among the components, the CE functions as a cathode and plays the role of regenerating the redox couples in the electrolyte and collecting the electrons through the external load. As a result, many electrocatalytic active materials were evaluated to test the electrocatalytic ability and to develop high performance CEs.12,22 To develop high performance CEs, the following requirements need to be fulfilled: (i) low charge transfer resistance (Rct), (ii) high surface area and conductivity, (iii) chemical, electrochemical and mechanical stability, (iv) energy level matching with redox couples in the electrolyte, (v) good adhesion with transparent substrates, and (vi) low-cost.12 Due to the high electrocatalytic ability and conductivity, Pt has become a good candidate, satisfying the above requirements.23 However, it is well-known that chemical corrosion with the electrolyte and the scarcity of Pt CEs obstructed their practical applications.24,25 Above all, it is sine qua non to develop non-precious metal and/or metal-free electrocatalysts with high electrocatalytic ability and long-term electrochemical stability in both Co(bpy)32+/3+ (bpy = 2,2′-bipyridine) and I−/I3− redox couples for practical use in DSSCs.12,26 Therefore, carbon-based nanomaterials including commercial carbons,27 nano-carbons,28–30 graphene,31,32 and template carbons33 were developed as Pt alternatives. In general, carbon-based nanomaterials were doped with heteroatoms or metalloids to bestow efficient in-plane charge transfer rates and to improve the polarization of charge density in carbon structures, thereby enhancing the electrocatalytic ability.29 The polarization changes by the difference of the atom sizes and the electronegativities among carbon atom and the dopant atoms, such as heteroatoms and metalloids, could allow for modulating charge density distribution and electronic properties.11
We recently developed a copolymer templated nitrogen (N) enriched nanocarbon (CTNC) and its derivative, i.e., tellurium (Te) doped CTNC (Te-MC(A)), using the telluric acid precursor in our previous work.34–36 The doping of N and Te atoms caused the polarization difference in the charge density of the graphitic structure due to the difference in the electronegativity between carbon (χ = 2.55), nitrogen (χ = 3.04) and tellurium (χ = 2.10), thereby resulting in high electrocatalytic ability. In addition, the copolymer template method is a soft-template method for the carbonization, which possesses a facile preparation process and the possibility of tailoring the mesoporous structure. Also, the method allowed simple doping of various elements containing hetero-atoms and metalloids.36 The CTNC and Te-MC(A) prepared by the simple doping method showed a high electrocatalytic activity as CEs combined with Co(bpy)32+/3+ and I−/I3− redox electrolytes. However, for the I−/I3− redox electrolyte, the CTNC CEs showed slightly lower PCEs than those of Pt CEs,34 while Te-MC(A) CEs exhibited higher PCEs than those of Pt CEs.36 This can be attributed to the charge transfer mechanism of the I−/I3− redox couple at the cathode.31 In general, the reduction of I3− ions mainly takes place through the inner-path charge transfer mechanism from a cathode in which electrons are transferred after chemical bonding.31,37 This is also the reason for doping various heteroatoms, metalloids and metal oxide into carbon materials. The Co(bpy)33+ ions are reduced through the outer-path charge transfer mechanism while the electron tunneling occurs through the electrical double layer.31,37 In terms of the charge transfer mechanism, the doping of Te into the mesoporous carbon (MC) is beneficial for the electrocatalytic reduction of two different ions, i.e., Co(bpy)33+ and I3− ions, compared to the doping of N into MC (CTNC).36 In addition, as shown by our previous results, Te-MC(A)s were prepared using telluric acid, a highly toxic reagent, and the Te doping level of Te-MC(A) is low.36
Therefore, in this study, to increase the Te doping level, a Te-doped carbon material (Te-MC(P)) was synthesized by facile pyrolysis of a mixture of a polyacrylonitrile-b-poly(n-butyl acrylate) (PAN-b-PBA) copolymer and a tellurophene-based polymer. The electrocatalytic effect achieved by increasing the doping level of the Te atom was carefully scrutinized with various measurements. We also found that the increase of Te doping levels in carbonaceous materials significantly affects the electrocatalytic ability of CEs and improves the overall photovoltaic performance combined with the Co(bpy)32+/3+ electrolyte and the I−/I3− electrolyte.
2. Results and discussion
Two different polymers, mesoporous carbon and tellurium precursor sources, were synthesized for preparing the Te-MC(P) nanomaterials. First, as a source of mesoporous carbon, a block copolymer (PAN-b-PBA) was synthesized using the atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) method. The block copolymer consisted of a N-doped carbon block (PAN) and a sacrificial block (PBA).34,36 A tellurium precursor source, poly(3-hexyltellurophene) polymer, was then synthesized by a catalyst transfer polycondensation method, according to the literature (Fig. S1–S7 and Table S1†).38,39 The detailed synthesis procedures of the PAN-b-PBA copolymer and poly(3-hexyltellurophene) polymer are presented in the Experimental section. The Te-MC(P) material was synthesized by facile stabilization and pyrolysis of the PAN-b-PBA copolymer with poly(3-hexyltellurophene), as displayed in Fig. 1. In detail, the block copolymer was dissolved in dimethylformamide (DMF), poly(3-hexyltellurophene) was homogeneously dispersed in DMF and then the two solutions were physically mixed by ultrasonication. For the removal of the solvent from the solution, the electrospinning technique was used. To prepare Te-MC(P), initially, the mixture of the PAN-b-PBA copolymer and poly(3-hexyltellurophene) polymer was stabilized at 280 °C for 2.5 hours under an air atmosphere (at a flow rate of 100 mL min−1) at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1. Sequentially, the carbonization process was conducted at 900 °C for 1 hour under a N2 gas atmosphere at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1. The detailed preparation method of the Te-MC(P) materials is presented in the Experimental section. We hypothesize that the Te-doping mechanism in the soft-templated carbon materials with the PAN-b-PBA copolymer and poly(3-hexyltellurophene) polymer is as shown in Scheme 1.40,41 In the stabilization step, the poly(3-hexyltellurophene) might be converted to the poly-tellurophene due to the cleavage of the hexyl chain attached to the aromatic tellurophene backbone. Then, in the carbonization step, poly-tellurophene might be decomposed to the tellurophene and other decomposed compounds like methaneditellone, and these organotellurium compounds could be bonded to the carbon matrix (Fig. S7†). As a result, it can be seen that the poly(3-hexyltellurophene) precursor acted as a “Trojan Horse” for the Te-doping in the carbon material.

Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) images were observed to identify the surface morphology and porosity of Te-MC(P). As displayed in Fig. 2(a) and (b), the Te-MC(P) material consists of numerous pores with a diameter of ∼250 nm and a 3D bi-continuous structure containing many defect sites. To confirm the surface area and pore size distribution of the prepared Te-MC(P) more clearly, the N2 adsorption/desorption isotherm measurement was carried out. Fig. 3(a) displays the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm, and the porosity characteristics are listed in Table 1. The Te-MC(P) material has a variation of type II (type IV isotherms) containing a hysteresis loop of type H1 (Fig. 3(a)), which shows a well-developed uniform pore structure and inter-connected porous structure.36,42 The specific surface area and pore volumes of Te-MC(P) were calculated by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) equation using the N2 adsorption results. The specific surface area of Te-MC(P) was 483.64 m2g−1 and the total pore volume was 0.91 cm3 g−1. In particular, the as-prepared carbon material is mainly composed of mesopores with an interconnected pore structure with an average pore size of 12 nm. The well-made mesoporous structure in the carbon framework can improve the catalytic ability, which indicates favorable diffusion of the electrolyte and the contact between the MC and redox couples. In addition, the crystal properties of Te-MC(P) are obtained by wide-angle X-ray diffraction (XRD), where two broad peaks at 25° and 43° were observed, as shown in Fig. 3(b), which is consistent with the (002) and (001) layers of graphite, respectively. These results indicate that the Te-MC(P) material possesses an amorphous and disordered carbon layer. The chemical structure and the degree of disorder were also investigated by Raman spectroscopy (see Fig. S8†). The Raman spectrum of Te-MC(P) exhibited three main peaks, the D band (∼1350 cm−1), G band (∼1590 cm−1) and A band (∼1510 cm−1). The D band arises from the structural defect and the accompanying impurities due to doping heteroatoms and metalloids, while the G and A bands are attributed to the in-plane stretching vibration of hybridized sp2 carbon atoms and an amorphous structure in the carbonaceous material, respectively. In addition, the D band, with many impurities positioned at the edge site of carbon materials, is associated with the electrocatalytic ability. The intensity ratio between the D and the G band(ID/IG) shows the degrees of defects in carbonaceous materials.43 The ID/IG value of Te-MC(P) is 2.70 (see Fig. S8†), a value higher than that of Te-MC(A) (2.55) in the previous work. This reflects that Te-MC(P) has more structural defects and electrocatalytic sites than Te-MC(A). Furthermore, the above characterization results suggest that Te-MC(P) consists of a 3D and hierarchical graphite-like structure with a number of defect sites.

By the XPS measurement, the chemical state of Te-MC(P) was investigated, as shown in Fig. 4. The corresponding composition of Te-MC(P) estimated by XPS is listed in Table 2. The peaks at ∼286 eV, ∼400 eV, ∼532 eV and ∼580 eV in the XPS spectrum of the Te-MC(P) material were observed and assigned to C 1s, N 1s, O 1s and Te 3d, respectively. The atomic contents of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen and tellurium in Te-MC(P) are 89.1, 4.99, 5.63 and 0.27 atom % (at. %, respectively. In our previous study, the doping amount of tellurium in Te-MC(A) was 0.15 at% when telluric acid was used as a precursor. In contrast, using the poly(3-hexyltellurophene) polymer resulted in an increase of the tellurium doping level by almost 2 times. This indicates that the use of the poly(3-hexyltellurophene) polymer as a precursor is an effective strategy to increase the tellurium doping level in soft-template N-enriched carbon materials. However, the doping amount of N in Te-MC(P) (4.99 at%) was significantly decreased compared to that of Te-MC(A) (9.15 at%) due to the higher pyrolysis temperature.16 As the pyrolysis temperature increases, the atomic ratio of N/C in the carbon framework decreases, resulting in a more graphite-like structure. To obtain more detailed information on the bonding characteristics in Te-MC(P) materials, a high-resolution XPS analysis was also performed. The XPS spectra for each element are displayed in Fig. 5. As presented in Fig. 5(a), the C1 spectrum was split into five components, positioned at ∼283.3 eV (C–Te), ∼284.6 eV (graphitic carbon), ∼285.7 eV (C–O), ∼286.8 eV (CTe) and ∼288.5 eV (CO). The N 1s (see Fig. 5(b)) spectrum also split into four peaks at ∼398.2 (pyridinic-N), ∼400.1 (pyrrolic-N), ∼401.2 (quaternary-N), and ∼402.5 (pyridinic-N–O−). The O 1s spectrum (see Fig. 5(c)) was split into three peaks at ∼530.8 (Te–O), ∼531.8 (CO) and ∼533.0 eV (C–O). For the deconvolution of the Te 3d spectrum (see Fig. 5(d)), four peaks were observed at ∼573.8, ∼575.7, ∼584.2 and ∼586.2 eV, respectively. Two peaks were consistent with Te–O (∼575.7 and 586.2 eV) and the other two peaks matched C–Te (∼573.8 and 584.2 eV).35 The overall XPS results provided information about the heteroatoms and tellurium functionalization with the carbon matrix.

EDS was performed to evaluate the distribution of atoms on the Te-MC(P) surface. The elemental mapping images are displayed in Fig. S9.† The elemental mapping images of Te-MC(P) showed that all elements were uniformly dispersed in the carbon matrix, thus indicating that the Te atoms were well-incorporated in the carbonaceous materials.
Given the characterization of Te-MC(P), EIS was performed by using the symmetrical dummy cell tests to evaluate the electrocatalytic ability of CEs, compared to those of Pt and Te-MC(A).36 All carbon-based CEs were fabricated by the electrostatic spray (e-spray) method on the fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)/glass substrate and the Pt CEs were also fabricated by the pyrolysis of H2PtCl6 as a reference CE (see Fig. S10†). The active surface areas of the Pt and carbon based CEs were 0.42 cm2 (0.7 cm × 0.6 cm) and 0.3 cm2 (0.6 cm × 0.5 cm), respectively. The Te-MC(P) CEs were optimized as a function of the loading amount onto the FTO substrates (see Fig. S11 and S12†). The detailed fabrication methods are provided in the ESI.† The electrochemical redox reaction is strongly dependent on the kinetics, such as the mass transport and charge transfer rate at the electrode surface. In addition, the kinetics was affected by the charge transfer mechanisms (inner- and outer-path charge transfer mechanisms) and the binding energy between the redox couples in the electrolyte and catalytic sites on the electrode surface. Therefore, the performance of CEs is determined by the characteristics of the electrocatalytic sites, which affect the cathodic performance of DSSCs. The electrocatalytic ability of CEs can affect the Jsc through dye regeneration and a comparison can be made between the reduction rate of the redox couple and the dye regeneration rate, which is a variation of Jsc. In general, it is well-known that the exchange current density (J0) can be used to evaluate the electrocatalytic activity of CEs, and is determined using the following equation: J0 = RT/nFRct(1)
where R is the gas constant, Rct the charge-transfer resistance, T the temperature and F the Faraday's constant. According to eqn (1),23,44J0 is inversely proportional to Rct, and the higher J0 and lower Rct values indicate the better performance of the CE. The Nyquist plots with the Co(bpy)32+/3+ and I−/I3− redox electrolytes are displayed in Fig. 6(a) and (b), respectively, and the resulting EIS parameters by fitting with an appropriate equivalent circuit are tabulated in Table 3. In Fig. 6(a), the Nyquist plots of three different CEs displayed two arcs.

For the Co(bpy)32+/3+ redox electrolyte, the smaller arc in a high-frequency region implies the resistance of charge transfer processes between the CE surface and the electrolyte, representing Rct and the double-layer capacitance (Cdl).13 The larger arcs in a low-frequency region indicate the Nernst diffusion (ZN), which is caused by the mass transport of the Co(bpy)32+/3+ redox pairs between the working and counter electrodes. For the I−/I3− redox electrolytes, there are also two arcs in the Nyquist plot of the Pt CEs. The first arc in the high-frequency region represents Rct and Cdl, while the second arc in the low-frequency region represents ZN. However, in the Nyquist plots of the carbon-based CEs, there are three arcs. The first arc in the Nyquist plots of carbon-based CEs in a high-frequency region is attributed to the electrochemical adsorption of I−/I3− ions on the carbon surface, which represents the transmission resistance (Rtm) and capacitance (Cad) (see Fig. S13 and Table S2†).36 The second arcs in the middle-frequency region represent Rct and Cdl, and the third arc in a low-frequency region represents ZN. As shown in Fig. 6(a), the first arc of the Te-MC(P) CE with the cobalt electrolyte is much smaller than those of the Pt and Te-MC(A) CEs. The Rct values of the three CEs were 0.88, 0.60 and 0.06 Ω cm2 for Pt, Te-MC(A) and Te-MC(P), respectively. The Rct value of the Te-MC(P)-based CE is lower by 13 times than that of the reference Pt CE, and by 10 times than that of the TeMC(A) CE. This indicates that the electrocatalytic ability of the Te-MC(P) CE is markedly better than those of the Pt and Te-MC(A) CEs. These results correspond to the J0 values of the three CEs (29.19, 42.82 and 428.19 mA cm−2 for Pt, Te-MC(A) and Te-MC(P) CEs, respectively) according to eqn (1). As the Te doping level increased from 0.15 (Te-MC(A)) to 0.27 at% (Te-MC(P)) by approximately 2 times, the electrocatalytic ability of the carbon-based CEs increased by 10 times with the Co(bpy)32+/3+ electrolyte. These results showed that the Te doping into carbon materials is beneficial for the enhancement of the electrocatalytic ability of carbon-based CEs, and for the efficient electrocatalytic outer-path charge transfer, even though the N doping amount of Te-MC(P) is much lower than that of Te-MC(A) (see Table 2).31 Interestingly, for the I−/I3− redox electrolyte, for inner-path charge transfer, the Rct values of the three CEs were estimated to be 0.67, 0.33 and 0.56 Ω cm2 with J0 values of 19.17, 13.52 and 21.17 mA cm−2 for the Pt, Te-MC(A) and Te-MC(P) CEs, respectively (see Fig. 6(b) and Table 3). The Rct value of the Te-MC(P) CE was slightly higher than that of the Te-MC(A) CE, but lower than that of the Pt CE. However, the effective charge transfer resistance (Rtm + Rct) of the Te-MC(P) CE showed a lower value than those of the Pt and Te-MC(A) CEs, indicating the better electrocatalytic ability of Te-MC(P) (see Table 3). Interestingly, the Rct and Cdl values of the Te-MC(P) (0.03 Ω cm2 and 2.5 μF cm−2) CE were remarkably lower than those of the Te-MC(A) CE (0.62 Ω cm2 and 15.21 μF cm−2), which may be due to a much lower N doping level of Te-MC(P) than that of Te-MC(A) (see Table 2).
To further evaluate the electrocatalytic ability of the three CEs, the linear sweep voltammetry measurement was performed using symmetrical dummy cells.45 The current density was recorded with respect to the voltage. Fig. 7(a) and (b) display the Tafel plots of the three CEs with Co(bpy)32+/3+ and I−/I3− electrolytes, respectively. The overall cell resistance (RCV) and the J0 values obtained from the Tafel plots are tabulated in Table 3. As presented in Fig. 7(a) and (b), the Tafel plot of the Te-MC(P) CE with both Co(bpy)32+/3+ and I−/I3− electrolytes displayed a steeper slope of the tangent compared to those of the Pt and Te-MC(A) CEs. The RCV values of the CEs with the Co(bpy)32+/3+ electrolyte were determined to be 7.91, 6.14 and 6.11 Ω cm2 with J0 values of 21.31, 34.02 and 36.74 mA cm−2 for the Pt, Te-MC(A) and Te-MC(P) CEs, respectively. For the I−/I3− electrolyte, the RCV values of the Pt, Te-MC(A) and Te-MC(P) CEs were determined to be 5.87, 6.08 and 5.36 Ω cm2 with J0 values of 22.39, 18.70 and 26.49, respectively. These results display a similar trend with the related EIS results. In addition, the Te-MC(P) CE displayed a higher limiting current than that of Pt for both Co(bpy)32+/3+ and I−/I3− electrolytes. It could be expected that the DSSCs based on Te-MC(P) CEs exhibit higher Jsc values compared to the Pt counterpart.

In addition, to examine the electrocatalytic ability of Te-MC(P) CEs with regard to Pt CEs, cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed using the Pt and Te-MC(P) CEs as the working electrode with Co(bpy)32+/3+ and I−/I3− redox pairs. Fig. 8(a) and (b) display the CV plots of the Pt and Te-MC(P) electrodes. At two different electrodes, the reversible peaks were measured with two redox couples. In the reversible peaks, the anodic peak current (Ipa) arises from the oxidation of Co(bpy)32+ or I− ions, while the cathodic peak current (Ipc) arises from the reduction of Co(bpy)33+ or I3− ions. The peak potential separation (Epp) was derived from the equation Epp = Epc (the cathodic peak potential) − Epa (the cathodic peak potential). The gap of Epp and the magnitude of the peak current are used to examine the electrocatalytic ability of the CEs. A smaller gap of Epp and a higher peak current indicate a better electrocatalytic ability. As shown in Fig. 8(a), the Te-MC(P) materials with Co(bpy)33+ redox pairs displayed a slightly smaller gap of Epp and higher peak current than the Pt counterpart, which indicates the better electrocatalytic ability. However, the Te-MC(P) with I−/I3− redox pairs shows a larger gap of Epp and a higher peak current than the Pt CE (see Fig. 8(a)), which could be due to the adsorption of I−/I3− on the graphitic basal plane in the mesoporous carbon.31 At different scan rates, the CV plots of Te-MC(P) and Pt also displayed the same tendency (see Fig. S14 and Table S3†).

After an in-depth investigation of the electrocatalytic ability of Pt, Te-MC(A) and Te-MC(P)- based dummy cells, the cells were incorporated as CEs into DSSCs with the SGT-021 porphyrin dye for the Co(bpy)32+/3+ electrolyte and the N719 ruthenium dye for the I−/I3− electrolyte (see Fig. S15†)24,34,46,47 The fabrication procedure is presented in the ESI.† All current–voltage (J–V) curve characteristics under air mass (AM) 1.5 G irradiation at 100 mW cm−2 are depicted in Fig. 9, and the resulting photovoltaic parameters are tabulated in Table 4 and Table S4.† The corresponding incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) plots are displayed in Fig. S16.† For DSSCs using the SGT-021 dye with the Co(bpy)32+/3+ electrolyte, the Te-MC(A) and Te-MC(P) CE-based DSSCs (TeMC(A)-DSSCs and TeMC(P)-DSSCs, respectively) showed higher averaged PCEs of 12.45% (JSC = 17.32 mA cm−2; VOC = 923.6 mV; FF = 77.8) and 12.62% (JSC = 17.43 mA cm−2; VOC = 922.4 mV; FF = 78.5), respectively, and the averaged PCE of 12.06% (JSC = 17.27 mA cm−2; VOC = 917.7 mV; FF = 75.9) for the reference Pt CE-based DSSCs (Pt-DSSCs). Compared to Pt-DSSCs, TeMC(A)-DSSCs and TeMC(P)-DSSCs exhibited an improvement in the JSC, VOC and PCE values. In addition, the FF values of DSSCs increased in the order Pt < Te-MC(A) < Te-MC(P) CEs, which is consistent with the trend in the J0 values of the CEs (see Table 3). For DSSCs using the N719 dye with the I−/I3− electrolyte, the PCEs of DSSCs also increased in the order 9.30% (Pt) < 9.38% (Te-MC(A)) < 9.65% (Te-MC(P)). The TeMC(P)-DSSCs (JSC = 16.50 mA cm−2; VOC = 765.7 mV; FF = 76.0) displayed improved JSC, VOC and FF values compared to those of Pt-DSSCs (JSC = 16.38 mA cm−2; VOC = 761.1 mV; FF = 74.6) and TeMC(A)-DSSCs (JSC = 16.40 mA cm−2; VOC = 757.7 mV; FF = 75.5). On comparison of DSSCs with carbon-based CEs, the TeMC(P)-DSSCs with two different electrolytes showed better photovoltaic performance than the TeMC(A)-DSSCs. This indicates that increasing the Te doping level in carbon materials is an effective strategy to enhance the device performance.

For understanding the photovoltaic phenomena of the Pt, Te-MC(A) and Te-MC(P) CE-based DSSCs, EIS was performed using the DSSC devices in the dark under a forward bias of −0.90 V for the Co(bpy)32+/3+ electrolyte and −0.75 V for the I−/I3− electrolyte. Fig. S17† depicts the Nyquist plots in the high-frequency region (from 1 × 106 to 10−1 Hz). The first arc of the DSSCs in the Nyquist plots represented Rct and it is confirmed that the TeMC(P)-DSSCs with Co(bpy)32+/3+ and I−/I3− electrolytes have smaller arcs than those of the Pt-DSSCs and TeMC(A)-DSSCs. This indicates that the enhancement in JSC and FF values of the TeMC(P)-DSSCs is attributed to their highly efficient electrocatalytic ability. The Rct values of the DSSCs were determined to be 1.70, 0.24 and 0.14 Ω cm2 for the Co(bpy)32+/3+ electrolyte and 1.05, 0.76 and 0.15 Ω cm2 for the I−/I3− electrolyte (Pt-DSSCs, TeMC(A)-DSSCs and TeMC(P)-DSSCs, respectively), which well-matches with the trend in the Rct and R0 values obtained from the symmetrical dummy cell tests. This demonstrates a remarkable electrocatalytic ability of the Te-MC(P) CEs, even in actual DSSC devices.
Finally, the electrochemical stabilities of the Pt and Te-MC(P) CEs were examined using the symmetrical dummy cells with Co(bpy)32+/3+ and I−/I3− redox pairs. The EIS for the newly prepared dummy cells was initially measured.13 After 100-cycle CV scans, EIS was measured again. This work was repeated five times to observe the electrochemical changes in the Pt and Te-MC(P) CEs in the target dummy cells. The electrochemical stabilities of two CEs using Co(bpy)32+/3+ (Fig. 10(a) and (b)) and the I−/I3−electrolytes (Fig. 10(c) and (d)) are displayed. As the number of cycles increased, the size of the first arcs of Pt CEs significantly increased (Fig. 10(a) and (c)), while a slight change was observed in those of the Te-MC(P) CEs (Fig. 10(b) and (d)), with two redox couples. Overall, it can be concluded that Te-MC(P) CEs are a promising alternative to Pt CEs, as highly stable and efficient electrocatalytic CEs for DSSCs.

3. Conclusions
In summary, a new type of tellurium-doped carbon material (Te-MC(P)) was successfully synthesized by the facile stabilization and pyrolysis of the PAN-b-PBA block copolymer with a tellurophene-based polymer (poly(3-hexyltellurophene) as the tellurium precursor. The chemical states of Te-MC(P) were investigated by using various characterization methods. The Te-MC(P) was mainly composed of mesopores and retained the 3D hierarchical graphite-like structure, exhibiting favorable diffusion of the electrolyte and the contact between the MC and redox pairs. The Te doping amount was 0.27 at%, which is an increased doping amount of Te atoms by approximately two times, compared to our previous work with Te-MC(A). Then, the as-prepared Te-MC(P) was examined by using a dummy cell test with various electrochemical measurements. The Te-MC(P) CEs, combined with Co(bpy)32+/3+ and I−/I3− redox electrolytes, showed a significant enhancement in the electrocatalytic ability, compared to the Pt reference and Te-MC(A) CEs. In particular, the charge-transfer resistance (Rct) of the Te-MC(P) CEs with the Co(bpy)32+/3+ redox pair was much lower by approximately 10 times than those of two CEs. The excellent electrocatalytic ability of Te-MC(P) CEs was observed in the actual DSSCs. A lower Rct resulted in the improvement in the photovoltaic performance of the DSSCs (especially, the fill factor). Hence, the DSSCs with Te-MC(P) CEs outperformed the Pt and Te-MC(A)-based DSSCs. Furthermore, the Te-MC(P) CEs showed remarkable electrochemical stability in both Co(bpy)32+/3+ and I−/I3− electrolytes compared to the Pt CEs. As a result, it can be shown that the newly prepared Te-MC(P) CEs are a promising alternative to the Pt CEs as low-cost, highly stable and efficient electrocatalytic CEs in the iodide and cobalt redox couples for practical applications in dye-sensitized solar cells.
4. Experimental
4.1. Materials
2-Chloro-N-methoxy-N-methylacetamide, hexylmagnesium bromide (2 M in diethyl ether) diethyl ether, HCl, sodium bicarbonate, MgSO4, ethynylmagnesium bromide (0.5 M in THF), ammonium chloride, tellurium, NaBH4, potassium hydroxide, dichloromethane, p-toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate, hexanes, dimethylformamide, N-iodosuccinimide, sodium thiosulfate, isopropylmagnesium chloride, Ni(dppe)Cl2 catalyst, methanol and chloroform were provided by Sigma-Aldrich and Tokyo Chemical Industry Corporation. 2,5-Diiodo-3-hexyltellurophene was synthesized according to the literature.39
4.2. Polymerization of poly(3-hexyltellurophene)
About 1.9 g (3.7 mmol) of 2,5-diiodo-3-hexyltellurophene was dissolved in THF (27 mL) and mixed with 0.38 g (3.7 mmol) of isopropylmagnesium chloride. The mixture was stirred at RT for 15 min and then 0.039 g (0.074 mmol) of the Ni(dppe)Cl2 catalyst was added; the mixture was stirred at RT for 3 hours and then quenched with a 3% HCl solution. The product was precipitated into methanol and facilitated with filter paper. The precipitate was purified by Soxhlet extraction (methanol, hexanes and chloroform). A dark purple solid (0.33 g, yield: 31%) was obtained.
4.3. Preparation of the Te-doped mesoporous carbon material
About 1 g of the PAN-b-PBA block polymer was dissolved in DMF (25 wt%) and physically mixed with the poly(3-hexyltellurophene solution (in DMF, 0.1 g mL−1). The mixed solution was sprayed by the electrospinning technique with an electrospun collector at 15 kV (the distance between the needle and the collector is approximately 15 cm); the mixture turned into a solid state. The mixture was then directly placed in a furnace and stabilized at 280 °C for 2 hours under an air flow (100 mL min−1) at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1. The carbonization process was then carried out at 900 °C for 1 hour under a N2 gas flow at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1.
