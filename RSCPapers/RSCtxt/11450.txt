    , Accepted 22nd April 2023First published on 8th June 2023AbstractTransition-metal oxides are widely used to improve the power conversion efficiencies of organic or perovskite solar cells because their chemical and electronic properties can be tuned to enable charge exchange with a wide variety of semiconductor materials. In this work, the atomic-layer-deposition of ultrathin Co3O4 anode interlayers which are used as hole transporting/electron blocking layers in organic photodetectors is investigated. Incident light loss and carrier transport loss could be minimized due to the ultrashort transport path. It is found that the highly smooth Co3O4 interlayer with a deep valence band of 5.3 eV and a shallow conduction band of 1.6 eV effectively promotes photogenerated charge extraction and suppresses the electron injection under reverse bias, resulting in a significantly improved photodetection performance. At an optimal Co3O4 thickness of 1 nm, the dark current of the Co3O4 device is almost 1 order of magnitude lower than that of the PEDOT:PSS device. As a result, we have demonstrated a P3HT:PC61BM-based device with a low dark current of 2.5 nA cm−2 and a high detectivity of 1013 Jones at −1 V bias, which are higher than those of the commercial silicon-based photodiodes. Such ultrathin charge blocking layers are proved to be versatile in reducing the dark current for devices with NIR-absorbing NFA.
Introduction
Solution processed advanced organic photodetectors (OPDs) are at the core of many technologies and applications, including optical communications, environmental monitoring, imaging sensors, night vision, remote controls and medical diagnoses.1–6 The phase-separated bulk heterojunction (BHJ) composed of donor polymers and acceptor molecules sandwiched between charge extraction layers is the most widely used device structure for both organic photovoltaics7–9 and photodetectors.10–12 The BHJ facilitates photocarrier generation at the donor–acceptor interface, in which both components form continuous percolating pathways throughout the film for efficient hole and electron extraction. Different from organic solar cells operated under forward bias in photovoltaic mode for power conversion, OPDs typically operate under reverse bias for photodetection. Therefore, suppressing the dark current in the dark while retaining high photosensitivity under light illumination is crucial for high-performance OPDs to compete with their inorganic counterparts.12–14
The charge carrier injection from the metal contacts into the organic photoactive layer under reverse bias15,16 and the bulk thermal generation17 constitute the main sources of dark current. However, because the band gaps of most of the organic semiconductors are large than 1 eV, which is much higher than the thermal activation energy at room temperature (∼0.025 eV), the contribution of hot carriers to dark current can typically be ignored. Therefore, the charge injection under reverse bias dominates the dark current of OPDs. In an OPD device, electrons and holes would inject from the anode and cathode electrodes into the BHJ, respectively. The charge carrier injection efficiency is determined by the energy barrier between the BHJ and electrodes at each contact side. Thus, introducing a charge blocking layer between the metal–BHJ interfaces to enhance the injection barrier is a common strategy to reduce the dark current.14,18–20 However, the introduction of a charge blocking layer with a thickness of several tens of nanometers may also affect the transfer and transport efficiency of photogenerated charge carriers due to the longer carrier transport path, thus sacrificing part of the photocurrent and the consequent photosensitivity.
Herein, the atomic layer deposition (ALD) of ultrathin Co3O4 anode interlayers which are used as hole transporting/electron blocking layers in organic photodetectors is investigated. Incident light loss and carrier transport loss could be minimized due to the ultrashort transport path. The ALD deposited Co3O4 films were very good in uniformity, smoothness, and conformality, and the film thickness could be precisely controlled at the angstrom level. An inverted planar OPD structure of ITO/Co3O4/BHJ/Al is adopted to examine the electrical properties of ALD Co3O4 films. To demonstrate the general applicability of this approach, two kinds of widely used donor/acceptor combinations (P3HT:PC61BM and PM6:IT4F) were employed. It is found that the ultrathin Co3O4 interlayer effectively suppresses the electron injection in the dark and promotes photogenerated charge extraction under light illumination under reverse bias, resulting in a significantly improved photodetection performance in both cases. At an optimal Co3O4 thickness of 1 nm, the dark current of the Co3O4 device is almost 1 order of magnitude lower than that of the PEDOT:PSS device. Moreover, a higher photocurrent for the Co3O4 device is achieved as compared to the PEDOT:PSS case. The fabricated organic photodetectors with a P3HT:PC61BM BHJ achieve the maximum responsivity of 0.3 A W−1 at a wavelength of 600 nm with a low dark current of 2.5 nA cm−2 at −1 V. The synergy of high responsivity and the low dark current leads to a dramatically high detectivity of 1013 Jones at −1 V bias. In addition, the device exhibits not only a large linear dynamic range of 163 dB, but also a fast rise/fall time of 72 μs/62 μs. Such an ultrathin charge blocking layer is proved to be versatile in reducing the dark current for devices with NIR-absorbing NFA.
Experimental section
Materials
The solvent chlorobenzene (CB) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Indium-doped tin oxide (ITO, 7–9 Ω sq−1) glass and poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT) were purchased from Advanced Election Technology Co., Ltd. PC61BM was purchased from Luminescence Technology Corp. (Lumtec). Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene-sulfonate) (PEDOTT:PSS) (1.3–1.7% dispersion in H2O solution) was purchased from P-OLED (Xi’an) Technology Co., Ltd. All chemicals were used as received without further treatment.
Device fabrication
A dry mixture of highly regioregular P3HT and PC61BM in a 1:1 weight ratio was dissolved in 1,2-dichlorobenzene to a total concentration of 80 mg ml−1. The solutions were magnetically stirred overnight at 500 RPM and 60 °C inside a nitrogen-filled glovebox. The prepatterned ITO/glass substrates were cleaned by ultrasonication sequentially with acetone, deionized water, and 2-propanol each for 15 min and dried by nitrogen gas flow. Then the substrates were exposed to UV-ozone treatment for 15 min. The PEDOT:PSS layer was spin-coated on the cleaned ITO/glass substrates at a rotation speed of 5000 rpm for 35 s and then annealed at 150 °C in air for 20 min. The P3HT:PC61BM layer was then spin-coated on the PEDOT:PSS layer at a rotation speed of 1000 rpm for 40 s. The resulting wet films were then slowly dried in covered glass Petri dishes for at least 10 h. After this solvent annealing process, a portion of the P3HT:PC61BM was wiped off from the slides using chloroform or chlorobenzene in order to expose the underlying ITO electrode and allow electrical contact to be made. The ITO/Co3O4/P3HT:PC61BM slides were then thermally annealed on a hot plate at 150 °C for 10 min. All the solutions were filtered through an acrodisc PTFE syringe filter (Millipore 0.22 μm) prior to spin coating. A 150 nm-thick Al electrode was made by vacuum deposition with a base pressure of 2 × 10−6 torr. The OPD has a photoactive area of a diameter of 2 mm, defined by the overlapping area between the front ITO anode and the upper Al cathode.
Film characterization
The thickness of the ALD Co3O4 films was measured by spectroscopic ellipsometry (J.A. Woollam M-2000VI). Raman spectra were taken on a Renishaw inVia Reflex Raman system with an excitation wavelength of 514 or 532 nm. TEM was measured on a Jeol (JEM-3200FS) microscope (300 kV). The film for the TEM measurement was deposited on a SiNx-membrane TEM grid. RBS was measured in the Heavy Ion Institute at Peking University, using 2.022 MeV helium ions as the incident ions and collecting the backscattered signals at a scattering angle of 150°. The film for the RBS measurement was deposited on a flat glassy carbon substrate. XPS measurements were performed on a Thermo Scientific (Escalab 250Xi) XPS system using a monochromated Al Kα X-ray source. To remove surface adventitious carbon, the samples were subjected to 4 keV Ar+ ion sputtering for 40 s. The ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) experiments were carried out using an X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS) microprobe (Thermo Scientific, Escalab 250Xi). A He I (21.22 eV) discharge lamp (energy resolution of 0.1 eV) was used for UPS experiments, respectively. The samples were all biased at −10 V for better measurement of the secondary-electron cutoffs. The UV-vis-NIR spectra were measured using a PerkinElmer Lambda 750 UV/VIS/NIR Spectrometer. The film surface morphology was measured using an atomic force microscope (AFM) (Bruker, MultiMode 8-HR).
Characterization of OPD devices
Electrical characterization of the OPDs was carried out under ambient conditions using the Keithley B1500A semiconductor parameter analyzer equipped with a standard probe station. During light detection, the OPD and light source were placed in a metal box to avoid influence by ambient light. To acquire the spectra, a xenon lamp with tunable wavelengths between 200 and 1200 nm was used as the light source. The intensity of the incident light at different wavelengths was calibrated using a commercial silicon photodetector. The TFT backplane and readout system were bought from Hangzhou LinkZill Technology Co., Ltd. The model number of the backplane was SC-T-A064-2203.
Results and discussion
Co3O4 thin films were deposited on ITO glass substrates by ALD using ((seco-pinene)(MeCp)Co) and O2 plasma as the cobalt precursor and co-reacting oxidant, respectively.21 The deposition was carried out at 180 °C, and the cobalt precursor was kept at 50 °C. In each ALD cycle, the exposures of ((seco-pinene)(MeCp)Co) and O2 plasma were 225 and 900 mTorr s−1, respectively, and they were separated by 30 s of N2 purging. The composition of the as-deposited film was analyzed using Rutherford backscattering spectrometry (RBS). From the RBS spectrum shown in Fig. 1a and Fig. S1 (ESI†), the O/Co atomic ratio (i.e., x) of CoOx was determined to be 1.25 ± 0.01, which well agreed with the stoichiometry of Co3O4. It should be noted that we obtained the RBS plot by subtracting the RBS spectrum of pure glass carbon from that of the Co3O4 grown on the glass carbon, so there is no oxygen peak found for the substrate. The Raman spectrum was measured on a 20 nm film deposited on quartz, and Fig. 1b shows the acquired Raman spectrum with substrate background subtracted. The spectrum shows a series of peaks at 195, 481, 522, 621, and 691 cm−1, which are consistent with the F2g, Eg, F2g, F2g, and A1g modes of the spinel Co3O4, respectively. Fig. 1c shows a transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image and the associated electron diffraction pattern. The TEM image indicates that the film was polycrystalline, and the crystal structure was identified to be the spinel Co3O4 structure, which was further confirmed by fast Fourier transform (FFT) analysis of the boxed area in the TEM image. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was further employed to analyze the as-deposited films. XPS was used to evaluate the Co3O4 film purity. The sample was first treated with Ar+ sputtering for 40 s to remove the surface adventitious carbon. The obtained XPS survey spectrum is shown in Fig. 1d and Fig. S2 (ESI†), where the deposited Co3O4 film was found to be quite good in purity, with no detectable C impurity (i.e., below the detection limit of ≈1 at%). The resultant high-resolution spectrum is shown in Fig. 1e, where the Co 2p spectrum shows spin–orbit split peaks of 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 with a splitting energy of 15.2 eV, and the peak of Co 2p3/2 is located near 780 eV. The 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 peaks could be further deconvoluted separately into two components, which correspond to Co3+ (779.3 and 794.3 eV) and Co2+ (780.7 and 795.8 eV) in the octahedral and tetrahedral sites, respectively, of the Co3O4 spinel structure. Weak broad shake-up satellites appeared at 7–10 eV higher than the main bands, which are also characteristic of Co3O4. The O 1s spectrum (Fig. S3, ESI†) could be deconvoluted into two components at 529.4 and 531.0 eV. The major peak at 529.4 eV corresponds to the stoichiometric oxygen in Co3O4, while the wider peak at 531.0 eV corresponds to the non-stoichiometric oxygen in the surface region or OH species on the surface. The surface of the deposited films was found to be fairly smooth. Fig. 1f shows an atomic force microscopy (AFM) image of a 50 nm film, and the rms roughness was only 0.47 nm, which was only about 1% of the film thickness.

An inverted planar OPD structure of ITO/Co3O4/BHJ/Al is adopted to examine the electrical properties of ALD Co3O4 films. Note that the absorption edge of ALD Co3O4 is around 350 nm (Fig. S4, ESI†), suggesting that the insertion of ultrathin Co3O4 films will not affect light absorption of the photoactive layer. As a proof-of-concept, OPDs were fabricated composed of P3HT:PC61BM BHJ as the photoactive layer sandwiched between the charge transport layers and electrodes similar to the general device structure of an OPV, as shown in Fig. 2a. Fig. 2b shows the energy level diagram of the device. In this study, the Co3O4 interlayer with a deep valence band of 5.3 eV and a shallow conduction band of 1.6 eV was used as the charge transport layer to facilitate hole transfer under light illumination and inhibit the electron injection in the dark under a reverse bias. The P3HT:PC61BM BHJ photoactive layer has been previously optimized to achieve optimal BHJ morphologies with maximal photocurrent.22 It should be noted that the photoactive layer thickness was kept the same (≈300 nm) in all devices, thus ensuring the same effective electric field under a given voltage bias. To obtain an optimal thickness of the Co3O4 thin film for OPDs, Co3O4 layers with different ALD cycles are fabricated. Fig. 2c and Fig. S5 (ESI†) demonstrate the experimental results which compare five devices with different Co3O4 ALD cycles (0.6/1/2/5/10 nm). With the addition of the Co3O4 layer, the dark current significantly decreased, and, in particular, 1 nm of ALD Co3O4 gave out the lowest dark current density of 2.5 nA cm−2 at −1 V, which was almost 3 and 1 orders of magnitude lower than that for the device without Co3O4 interlayer, respectively. It is worth noting that the dark current density increased with increasing ALD Co3O4 thickness. ALD Co3O4 was found to be highly resistive with ≈10−4 S cm−1, which is much lower than that of PEDOT:PSS (1–1000 S cm−1). The voltage drop in the Co3O4 layer would increase dramatically with increasing thickness, which results in the improved electron injection efficiency under reverse bias. Therefore, the dark current density increased with the increasing Co3O4 thickness. In addition, the voltage drop within the organic BHJ will correspondingly decrease with a thicker Co3O4 layer, which would lower the charge carrier transport efficiency. Consequently, as experimentally observed, further increasing the Co3O4 thickness above 1 nm actually resulted in a decreased photocurrent. In addition, when the thickness of the Co3O4 interlayer exceeds 1 nm, the photocurrent decreases gradually with the increase of the Co3O4 thickness, which may be caused by the decrease of the transparency23 and the increase of the resistance with the increased Co3O4 thickness. For comparison, an OPD with the widely used PEDOT:PSS as the hole transport layer is also fabricated. Fig. 2d shows the current density–voltage characteristics for the OPD devices with 1 nm Co3O4 and PEDOT:PSS in the dark and under light illumination. It is found that the dark current of the optimized OPD with a 1 nm Co3O4 interlayer was almost 1 order of magnitude lower than that of the PEDOT:PSS-based device. The significantly suppressed dark current is due to the excellent electron blocking capacity of the Co3O4 interlayer. Since both the P3HT and PC61BM form percolating pathways for holes and electrons throughout the film, the energy barrier for electron injection is determined by the barrier height between the ITO anode (4.8 eV) and the LUMO level (4.2 eV) of PC61BM. Under this condition, the electron injection barrier is only ∼0.6 eV when ignoring the energy shift due to the interfacial diploe effect, which results in the large dark current of the device without the Co3O4 interlayer. Therefore, for the device with the Co3O4 interlayer, a large electron injection barrier of ∼3.2 eV is now determined due to the energy offset between the conduction energy of Co3O4 (1.6 eV) and ITO (4.8 eV). Meanwhile, as expected, the photocurrent of the device with 1 nm Co3O4 interlayer is higher than that of the device with PEDOT:PSS, suggesting that the ultrathin Co3O4 interlayer is beneficial for the photogenerated hole extraction process. We attributed the improved photocurrent to the minimized incident light loss and carrier transport loss resulting from the ultrashort transport path within the ultrathin Co3O4 interlayer.

R indicates how efficiently the OPD responds to light stimuli, which is defined as R = Iph/(PincS), where Iph is the photocurrent, Pinc is the incident light intensity, and S is the effective area of the OPD device. The calculated R spectra of the OPD with 1 nm Co3O4 under different reverse voltage bias is presented in Fig. 3a. The R increases with increasing absolute value of reverse bias irrespective of the wavelengths, suggesting higher efficiency of charge transfer under large electric field. However, R can only reflect the photoelectric conversion efficiency of the OPD, while another crucial figure of merit specific detectivity (D*) indicates both the photosensitivity and the dark current, which determines the ability of a photodetector to detect the weakest photo stimuli under various noises such as shot, Johnson (thermal), and flicker (1/f).24D* is described as D* = R (Sf)1/2In−1, where f is the electrical bandwidth and In is the noise current. Assuming that the total noises of the photodetector are dominated by shot noise in dark current, D* can also be simply expressed as D* = RS1/2(2eIdark)−1/2, where e is the elementary charge. Fig. 3b shows the detectivity spectra of both the Co3O4 and PEDOT:PSS based OPD. As expected, the D* of the Co3O4 based OPD is much higher than that of the device with PEDOT:PSS, which is a result of the higher photocurrent and lower dark current. And specifically, a high detectivity of 1013 Jones at −1 V bias is achieved at a wavelength around 600 nm, which is consistent with the absorption coefficient (Fig. S3, ESI†). More importantly, the detectivity of our device is almost 1 order of magnitude higher than that of a commercial Si photodiode,22 and the dark current density and detectivity of the OPDs with Co3O4 interlayer are superior to those of most of the reported P3HT:PC61BM OPDs (Table 1). Fig. 3c shows the noise power density spectra of the HJPT in the frequency range of 1 Hz–100 kHz under a reverse voltage bias of −1 V. The noise spectra follow the 1/f relationship in the frequency range from 1 Hz to 100 kHz, indicating that the total noise of our OPD device is indeed dominated by shot noise. The level of the noise current for the Co3O4 device is higher than that for the PEDOT:PSS device, which is consistent with the detectivity.

The photoresponse of the optimized OPD under various light irradiation was investigated by measuring the linear dynamic range (LDR), which indicates the ratio of the maximum and minimum light irradiance when the device maintains its linear response. Fig. 3d presents the photocurrent of the Co3O4 based OPD versus the incident light intensity. In the region of linear photocurrent for the OPD, Pmax and Pmin are the photocurrent density measured at a light intensity of 10−2 W cm2 and 10−10 W cm2, respectively. A high LDR of 163 dB is realized due to the low dark current of our Co3O4 OPD device, and is much higher than that of inorganic photodetectors.
The transient photoresponse of the OPD is assessed by measuring the change of current during on-and-off switching of incident light. Fig. 4a shows the current of the Co3O4 device under a reverse bias of −1 V responding to 600 nm light illumination with an incident light power of 0.15 mW cm−2 and a switch frequency of 100 Hz. The OPD exhibits a reproducible photodetection behavior for repeated light pulses. The photocurrent of our OPDs did not exhibit noticeable change after 100 cycles under square-wave modulated light source illumination, and the photoresponse can reach the steady-state photocurrent and dark current rapidly. It is seen in Fig. 4b that the device exhibited τrise and τfall of 72 and 62 μs, respectively, indicating fast responses against cyclic light on–off response examinations. Considering the limited test conditions, the cut-off frequency ends at 10000 Hz. As shown in Fig. 4c, it is obvious that the Co3O4 OPD achieves a −0.28 dB responsivity bandwidth of 10 kHz, which is higher than those of the PEDOT:PSS device (4 KHz) and other reported organic photodiodes.22

When the detection wavelength of the photodetector approaches near infrared (NIR) region, the dark current will significantly increase as compared to the visible photodetector, which is attributed to the adopted narrow band gap conjugated polymers15,34–37 or non-fullerene acceptors.38–42 Therefore, it is very important to reduce the dark current of the near-infrared detector to make it comparable with the silicon photodetector. In order to verify the feasibility of reducing the dark current of the NIR photodetector using ultrathin ALD Co3O4, we also fabricated a PM6:Y6 based OPD with the same device structure (Fig. S6, ESI†). As shown in Fig. 5a, the dark current of the Co3O4 device is again much lower than that of the PEDOT:PSS case. And the consequent specific detectivity is apparently improved as compared to the PEDOT:PSS device (Fig. 5b). Thus, such an ultrathin Co3O4 interlayer is proved to be versatile in reducing dark current for devices with NIR-absorbing Non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs).

To further study the effect of the Co3O4 films, we employed ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) to analyze the electronic structure and interface energy band alignment. Fig. 6a depicts the secondary-electron cutoffs of the bare ITO and Co3O4-coated ITO samples. After coating 1 nm Co3O4, the work function of ITO increased from 4.6 eV to 5.1 eV. The deeper valence band of Co3O4 facilitates the photogenerated hole extraction efficiency under light illumination. Fig. 6b shows an enlarged view of the small binding energy region of the Co3O4-coated ITO, where the O 2p and defect states of Co3O4 are visible. The onsets of the defect states were found to be very close to the Fermi level. Schematic electron band diagrams of the ALD Co3O4 are depicted according to the measured valence band, in which the d-band is partially occupied with a high number of electrons. And therefore, their valence spectra show states that disappear close to the Fermi level (Fig. 6c).

Solution-processed OPD is also the key to develop low-cost hybrid imaging technologies that combine certain advantages of organic materials with technically mature silicon technologies. OPD can be integrated with TFT backplanes or complementary metal-oxide–semiconductor (CMOS)-based readout integrated circuits (ROICs) with small pixel sizes.43–46 Here, we integrate the Co3O4 based OPD directly onto the TFT backplane to verify the feasibility of implementing an image sensor with OPD on active matrix backplanes with a-Si:H thin-film transistors. We demonstrated high-resolution imaging with a 64 × 64 array with a 200 μm × 200 μm pixel pitch for the Co3O4 based OPD. As shown in Fig. 7, the image capture was performed by illuminating the transparent PET film printed with the black letter “A” with 600 nm light illumination. Fig. 6b presents the captured letter image “A” with several bad point lines. These bad point lines in the image can be attributed to the physical damage of the TFT backplane during the device fabrication process. Despite all these, our OPD array based image sensor can clearly reflect the original image of the letter, demonstrating excellent imaging performance with the OPD array.

Conclusions
In this study, an ultrathin ALD Co3O4 (1 nm) electron blocking layer is introduced in fullerene and non-fullerene based OPDs, which is shown to effectively reduce the dark current density and promote photogenerated charge extraction in organic photodiodes with the photodetection wavelength range from visible to NIR. With this ultrathin interlayer, incident light loss and carrier transport loss could be minimized due to the ultrashort transport path. At an optimal Co3O4 thickness of 1 nm, the dark current of the Co3O4 device is almost 1 order of magnitude lower than that of the PEDOT:PSS device. As a result, we have demonstrated a P3HT:PC61BM-based device with a low dark current of 2.5 nA cm−2 and a high detectivity of 1013 Jones at −1 V bias, which are higher than those of the commercial silicon-based photodiodes. Our study not only proposed a general approach to the suppression of dark current and promoting the photosensitivity, but also highlighted the broad promise of this ALD approach for organic device applications in general.
