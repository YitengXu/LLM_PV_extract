    , Accepted 15th December 2010First published on 31st January 2011AbstractAt present, the photovoltaic performance of quantum dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSCs) is still much lower than conventional DSCs. Appropriate porous TiO2 photoanodes for QDSCs need to be further investigated, and optimization of the nanoparticle-based photoanodes is highly desirable as well. In this article, the influence of the structural properties of various TiO2 photoanodes on CdS/CdSe-sensitized solar cells have been systematically studied. Quantitative analyses of light-harvesting efficiency (LHE) and electron-transfer yield (ΦET) for the QDSCs are investigated for the first time. It is revealed that the LHE increases in the long wavelength region with the addition of large size TiO2 particles to the transparent film. In the meantime, the balance between the light scattering and surface area also needs to be controlled, which can significantly restrain the dark current of the device. A double-layer photoanodic structure can give 4.92% of light-to-electricity conversion efficiency with a photoactive area of 0.15 cm2.
1. Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) have received widely academic and commercial interest due to low cost and relatively high conversion efficiency.1,2 This kind of photovoltaic device is mainly composed of the following components: a sensitizer for light absorption to produce the photogenerated electrons, a nanoscale semiconductor porous photoanode (widely used TiO2) for photogenerated electrons transfer from the sensitizer to the external circuit, an electrolyte to shuttle between the photoanode and the counter electrode for the sensitizer regeneration to keep the cell running. In order to ensure practical application, considerable efforts have been devoted to optimize all compositions of the device.3–7 Recently, in the research of next-generation sensitizers, narrow-bandgap inorganic quantum dots (QDs) have been suggested and investigated.8–10 The unique characteristics of QDs over traditional dyes (such as Ru-polypyridine complexes and organic dyes), are their strong photo-response in the visible region, tunable band gaps simply by controlling the nanoparticle sizes and components. Moreover, the utilization of multiple exciton generation of QDs is expected to obtain much higher conversion efficiency.8 However, up to now, the cell performance reported on quantum-dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSCs) is still much lower than that of conventional DSCs.11–13
At the present stage of QDSCs, the poor performance could be mainly attributed to unsatisfactory assembly of the QDs onto the TiO2 photoanode. For one thing, this is mostly related to the QDs deposition methods. In general, two different deposition methods are adopted to realize QDs sensitizers over mesoporous TiO2 film, which are: (1) direct growth of the QDs on the TiO2 photoanode surface by chemical bath deposition (CBD) or by successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR); (2) pre-synthesized colloidal QDs attached to the electrode surface directly or with the aid of bifunctional linker molecules.11–15 These methods will sometimes be combined in order to achieve co-sensitized deposition.16 So far, highly effective coverage of QDs on the TiO2 mesoporous film surface as well as a relatively better photovoltaic performance, were mostly obtained by the first method.17
On the other hand, a suitable TiO2 film structure is indispensable for highly effective QDs loading up to a good light-to-electricity conversion efficiency. Different photoanodic structures have been attempted to fabricate the QDSCs. TiO2 inverse opal was applied to the CdSe-QDSC, the ordered interconnected pores of which were supposed to benefit the infiltration of QDs sensitizers and the hole transporting material into the photoanode, and an efficiency of 2.7% was achieved.13 Very recently, TiO2 nanotube/nanorod architectures for efficient transport of charge carriers have also been used.18–22 However, the preparation of these ordered structures is still not as easy as fabricating a nanocrystalline film used in the conventional DSCs, and will thus limit the potential application of this cell system in the future. Therefore, in order to develop highly efficient QDSCs, optimization of the nanoparticle-based photoanodes is highly desirable.
As we know, based on the sandwiched structure, QDSCs have many features in common with the conventional DSCs.23 However, there are also some elementary differences, such as different redox couples, electron transfer at QDs/TiO2 and electrolyte/counter electrode interfaces etc., which are essentially derived from the remarkable distinction between QDs and conventional dyes. By comparison of QDs with the conventional Ru-polypyridine or organic dyes, it is found that the diameter of QDs anchored on the photoanode generally ranges from 3 to 8 nm, much larger than that of dyes.9,11,24–26 Besides, the attaching ways onto TiO2 film are quite different, for the QDSCs, the semiconductor heterojunction formed with QDs in situ growth, whereas chemical bonding was for conventional dyes.9,17 Especially, it is supposed that multiple QDs layers may be anchored on the TiO2 photoanode.23 Accordingly, for the normal nanoparticle-based TiO2 film, its inner pores are much easier to be blocked while depositing QDs.27 Moreover, other factors such as TiO2 morphology, surface area, inner pore structure etc. will strongly influence the QDs loading and cell performance. Therefore, it is suggested that the optimization of TiO2 photoanode for QDSCs should at least meet the following requirements: (1) The TiO2 photoanode can provide enough surface area to satisfy efficient QDs deposit; (2) The pore size of the photoanode should be large enough to avoid being blocked during the QDs deposition. Of course, optical confinement and light scattering effect to improve the light absorption efficiency are also necessary.
In this present work, modification of TiO2 working electrode with larger TiO2 particles (300 nm) has been attempted with the aim of (1) adjusting optimal aperture distribution of TiO2 electrode for CdS/CdSe deposition and (2) improving light absorption in the long wavelength region by enhancing the optical light path. An optimal double layer photoanode structure is proposed and the highest light-to-electricity conversion efficiency of 4.92% has been achieved for the QDSC with a photoactive area of 0.15 cm2. To our knowledge, this result is by far the best cell performance of QDSCs.
2. Experimental section
Materials
Titanium(IV) isopropoxide (97%), ethyl cellulose were from Aldrich, sodium nitrilotriacetate (AR, N(CH2COONa)3) from Alfa Aesar Chemicals, terpineol, CdCl2, NH4Cl, thiourea, ammonia, sulfur, CdSO4, Zn(CH3COO)2 and Na2S from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. All chemicals in this study were used as received without further purification. All solutions for the electrolyte and QDs deposition were prepared using high-purity water obtained from a Milli-Q (Millipore Model RG) purification system. Na2SeSO3 was prepared by refluxing Se powder (50 mM) in an aqueous solution of Na2SO3 (125 mM) at 60 °C for 7 h, then filtered to remove the residual Se powder. 300 nm-sized rutile TiO2 particles were commercially available. The photoanode substrate was fluorine-doped tin oxide conducting glass (FTO, thickness: 2.2 mm, Pilkington, sheet resistance: 15 Ω/square), while the counter electrode substrate was brass sheet (thickness: 0.1 mm). Before use, these substrates were first washed with mild detergent, subsequently rinsed with water several times and with ethanol in an ultrasonic bath, and finally dried under air stream.
TiO2 film preparation
The preparation of 20 nm-sized anatase nanoparticle TiO2 was carried out according to the literature.6 Four kinds of TiO2 pastes used for screen printing were prepared by using 20 nm TiO2 nanoparticles, 300 nm TiO2 particles and their mixtures with a weight ratios of 3:7 and 7:3, which are dispersed in terpineol with ethyl cellulose (the same proportion by weight) as a binder. The pastes are denoted as P–T, P–S1, P–S2 and P–S3 in the order of increasing large size particles, respectively. Their Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface areas and the average porosities are depicted in Table 1, showing significant differences for pastes with a different compound of 20 nm TiO2 nanoparticles and 300 nm TiO2 particles. Various photoanodes for the QDs deposition were designed and prepared on FTOs using a screen printing technique, they are illustrated in Fig. 1. The films after printing were leveled for 15 min, then heated at 80 °C for 30 min, finally sintered at 450 °C for 30 min. Films T or TT, S1, S2 and S3, derived from the paste P–T, P–S1, P–S2, P–S3, respectively, were defined as a monolayer, TS1, TS2 and TS3 as double layers, and TS1S2 as a multilayer, respectively. And T and TT are transparent layers, S1, S2 and S3 are light scattering layers. Herein, in order to identify the cell performance of QDSCs with different structures, the overall photoanodic thickness except for T (12 μm) is kept the same (19 ± 1 μm). In the meantime, for comparing the effect of large particles on light absorption and cell performance, the thickness of the transparent layer in the double layer and multilayer films TS1, TS1S2, TS2 and TS3 is kept 12 μm, the same as T.

Fabrication of QDs on TiO2 photoanodes
A chemical bath deposition (CBD) technique was employed to assemble CdS and CdSe quantum dots in the sequence on the photoanodes.14 All the QDs (CdS and CdSe) depositions were carried out at 10 °C. CdS was deposited with an aqueous solution with the composition of 20 mM CdCl2, 66 mM NH4Cl, 140 mM thiourea and 230 mM ammonia with a final pH ca. 9.5 for about 30 min. The films were washed with water completely. Subsequently, CdSe was deposited by mixing an aqueous solution with 26 mM CdSO4, 40 mM N(CH2COONa)3 and 26 mM Na2SeSO3. The CdSe deposition was maintained for 5.5 h. Finally, the photoanodes were passivated with ZnS by twice dipping into 0.1 M Zn(CH3COO)2 and Na2S aqueous solution for 1 min alternately.
Electrode characterization
The morphologies of the TiO2 films were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), FEI XL30 S-FEG. The film thickness was measured by SEM. The surface areas and average porosities of four different TiO2 pastes were obtained using the N2 adsorption–desorption method on ASAP 2020 apparatus, Micromeritics. Light-harvesting efficiency (LHE) measurements of various TiO2 films with and without QDs were characterized on Shimadzu UV-2550 equipped with an integrating sphere in the wavelength range of 350–800 nm. An analogous sandwiched-type configuration was used for LHE measurements consisting of TiO2 film deposited on the cover glass, pure water and bare cover glass (thickness: 0.13–0.17 mm), as shown in Fig. 2.28 In order to determine the LHE spectra of the QDSCs, light loss caused by the light reflection at the glass/air interface and light absorption of FTO conducting glass was corrected according to Arakawa's method.28

Photovoltaic characterization
Photocurrent density-photovoltage (J–V) measurements were carried out on a sandwich structure solar cell in the dark and under illumination. Cu2S on brass was used as a counter electrode according to the literature.12 The polysulfide electrolyte (1M Na2S and 1M S) was sandwiched between the QDs-coated TiO2 film and the counter electrode to give the cell, which was separated by using a silicone spacer (thickness: 25 μm). A mask with a window of 0.15 cm2 was clipped on the TiO2 side to define the active area of the cell. The cells were irradiated by an Oriel Solar Simulator 91192 under AM 1.5 illumination of 100 mW cm−2. The incident light intensity was measured by a radiant power/energy meter (Oriel 70260). Princeton Applied Research, Model 263 A was used to record the J–V characteristics of the cells. The incident-photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was measured by DC method using a lab-made IPCE setup illuminated under 3–8 mW cm−2 monochromic light without bias illumination.29 For the open-circuit voltage-decay (OCVD) measurements, the cells were illuminated to a steady voltage (Voc), then the illumination was switched off. The OCVDs were recorded on Princeton Applied Research, Model 263 A. The decay analysis refers only to values measured in the dark.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Microstructure of the various photoanodes for QDSCs
As we know, a transparent TiO2 nanoparticles film can present a higher surface area for high dye coating, which is essential to achieve high light absorption efficiency. Of course, the TiO2 particles should have high crystallinity and be dispersed well. At the present stage of QDSCs, this kind of photoanode films has been generally adopted. However, when this transparent film is directly used as the photoanode, some disadvantages are found not to benefit the photovoltaic performance: (1) the pore size is usually small and the pore distribution is narrow; (2) long wavelength light can not be fully used since the transparent film has no light scattering property. Herein, the introduction of large particles into the photoanode has been used to solve these problems.
The morphologies of T, S1, S2 and S3 films are shown in Fig. 3. As we can see, the mesopores are uniformly distributed in these films. As shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†) and Table 1, with increasing the content of 300 nm-sized TiO2 in order of (a) → (b) → (c) → (d), the pore size and pore size distribution are increasing as well, however the interconnection between TiO2 particles is getting poor and the BET surface area is getting lower as well.

In this work, a combination of the four kinds of films in total gives 9 kinds of TiO2 photoanodes for further QDs deposition, as shown in Fig. 1. A facile and straightforward CBD method has been adopted to fabricate CdS/CdSe co-sensitizers onto the photoanode.14 When transparent films were directly deposited by CdS and CdSe QDs in sequence, distinct QDs are uniformly dispersed on the surface of TiO2 film without serious aggregation, as shown in Fig. 4. And the morphology of the TiO2 film becomes rougher after assembling the QDs. As we expected, most of the pores in the film are not blocked, implying that the electrolyte can well penetrate the photoanode. Identical deposition time for all these TiO2 photoanodes was adopted in order to obtain an analogical CdS/CdSe size, which was estimated as 5.8 nm by photoacoutic spectra (Fig. S2, ESI†). For other films comprised of 300 nm TiO2 particles, the pores blockage should not be a big problem during QDs deposition.

3.2 LHE measurement of the QD-sensitized TiO2 photoanodes
In general, the cell performance of QDSCs is determined by the short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc), the open-circuit photovoltage (Voc), the fill factor (FF), and the power of the incident light (P, 100 mW cm−2). Higher Jsc can be obtained by improving the light-harvesting efficiency (LHE) of the QD-sensitized TiO2 film, which is also essential for the higher IPCE value based on the following eqn (1): IPCE(λ) = LHE(λ)ϕinjηEC = LHE(λ)Φ(λ)ET(1)where ϕinj is the photogenerated electron injection yield, ηEC photogenerated electron collection efficiency at the FTO glass, LHE(λ) light harvesting efficiency, Φ(λ)ET electron-transfer yield which is the production of ϕinj and ηEC. Improvement of the LHE is generally dependent on: (1) the QDs should have wider light absorption range; (2) a large number and effective QDs' loading on TiO2 photoanode; (3) increasing the optical path length.26,30 In our experiments, the last two points are concerned after using the CBD method for QDs deposition.

Fig. 5(a) shows the transmittance and reflectance spectra of unsensitized-TS1 film. And its light collection is obtained by adding the transmittance and reflectance spectra together.28 It should be mentioned that, besides the reflection, the light collection also covers the back-scattered light resulting from the rough surface of TiO2 photoanodes. Obviously, for the TS1 film, the light collection above 400 nm almost reaches 100% while the light loss below 400 nm is primarily assigned to the light absorption of the film itself and thus exact LHE can not be obtained in this wavelength region. After being assembled with CdS/CdSe co-sensitizers, the absorption spectrum is obtained by adding its absorbed photon ratio in the forward side and in the backward side. In terms of the investigation of LHE spectra with the Ru dye, N719, it is supposed that the spectra of the transparent TiO2 films (T and TT) can present a similar shape to the CdS/CdSe absorption spectrum in the solution phase, thus indicating the light absorption is essentially dominated by the amount of CdS/CdSe loading on the film.31 As shown in Fig. 5(b), the light absorption in the range 400–600 nm can reach 88% without light loss correction, whereas the light absorption denoted as LHE is slightly reduced to 85% after correcting the light loss at the air/ glass and FTO glass/ TiO2 interfaces as well as light absorption of F-doped SnO2 film. The same measurements were also carried out for the other 8 types of films, and distinct LHE spectra are observed, see Fig. 5(c) and (d). One thing needs to be addressed, the scale of light absorption is represented as the ratio of absorbed photons to incident photons in Fig. 5(b), (c) and (d). Firstly, four monolayer TiO2 films TT, S1, S2 and S3 exhibit different LHE spectra. In terms of the similar thickness, the transparent film consisting of 20 nm TiO2 nanoparticles can present the highest light absorption, and the LHE decreases with increasing the content of the large particles (S1 > S2 > S3), which is in agreement with their surface area. For the T, TT films with different thickness, their highest light absorption values are almost the same whereas the light absorption for the thicker film is observed red-shifted. Secondly, for the double- and multilayer films, very similar LHE spectra are obtained. Compared to the TT film with the same thickness, their light absorption is enhanced at longer wavelength (>600 nm). Obviously, introduction of the scattering layer, S1, S2 or S3 into the photoanode can increase the optical path length of photoanodes, that is, the light absorption above 600 nm is enhanced for TS1, TS2, TS3 and TS1S2.

Light loss correction was derived from the reflection and absorption of FTO conducting glass. Inset: expansion of the selected square. 
3.3 IPCE spectra of the photoanodes with QDs
In order to fully understand the distinct influence of light scattering films on the photovoltaic performance of QDSCs, the IPCE spectra were also investigated. Fig. 6 presents the IPCE plots of various QDs-coated photoanodes. As shown in Fig. 6(a), among four monolayer films TT, S1, S2 and S3, the transparent film can give the best IPCE value due to its highest surface area for QDs deposition. With increasing large particles into the film, the IPCE drops remarkably in the order of S1, S2 and S3. Especially, although the maximum IPCE value of S1 is only 62% at 550 nm, lower than 81% for TT film, it has already extended the same action spectrum from 610 to 700 nm as TT film. This broad action spectrum is ascribed to efficient light scattering of large particles. Furthermore, since the transparent films have no light scattering, light loss owing to the light transmittance will result in poor IPCE in the longer wavelength region. Generally, increasing the film thickness is an easy way to enhance the light absorption. However, for T and TT films with different thickness, their maximum IPCE values are nearly the same in the range 460–570 nm while slight increase is observed for the thicker film from 570 nm to longer wavelength. Obviously, no attractive advantage is found in comparison with T film. Therefore, the utilization of scattering layer is assumed indispensable for improving the photovoltaic performance of QDSCs. As shown in Fig. 6(b), the structures with a light scattering layer can extend the photoresponse onset to the red region and remarkably improve IPCE values above 600 nm. Furthermore, TS1 and TS2 have broader edge in the red region than TS3, suggesting that the excess adding of large particles in the film will lower the IPCE in the whole wavelength range. QDSCs based on these double layer or multilayer structures can present by far the optimal IPCE spectra in comparison with the reported CdS/CdSe QDSCs systems.11,20 Therefore, it can be inferred that (1) the generation of photocurrent mainly benefits from the transparent layer; (2) in the case of the same film thickness, the proper content of large particles in the light scattering layer will bring higher photocurrent.
 Fig. 6  IPCE plots of monolayer QDs-coated electrodes (a), double layer QDs-coated electrodes (b). 
By using eqn (1), electron transfer yield ΦET is calculated and given in Table 2. Herein, ΦET at 550 nm is given. Distinct electron transfer yields are observed for the different structure photoanodes of QDSCs. The thinner transparent film can present the electron transfer yield of 0.924, slightly higher than the corresponding thicker film, which is in agreement with their cell performances. For three scattering films, the ΦET values decrease rapidly in the order of S1, S2 and S3, indicating the unsatisfactory interconnection between TiO2 particles will lead to poorer electron transfer and collection efficiency. The comparison of double layer films TS1, TS2, TS3 reveals that TS1 and TS2 can exhibit similar electron transfer yields, higher than TS3. However, the triple layer film TS1S2 can only give moderate ΦET. This further illustrates that the proper amount of large particles is essential to a higher photovoltaic performance of QDSCs.

3.4 Comparison of cell performances with and without scattering layers
When CdS/CdSe-coated photoanode was incorporated with a polysulfide electrolyte and Cu2S counter electrode to give a sandwich-type cell, the influence of various photoanodes on the photovoltaic performance can be clearly distinguished. As shown in Fig. 7(a) and Table 2, among the four monolayer photoanodes with the same thickness, QDSCs with transparent layer TT can present a relatively higher conversion efficiency, mainly associated with higher Jsc. The Jsc decreases rapidly in order of S1, S2 and S3 with decreasing the content of 20 nm-size particles, which will result in the decrease of the surface area, corresponding to the IPCE and ΦET values. In comparison with two transparent photoanodes T and TT, the thinner photoanode (T) is found to present higher Jsc and better cell performance than the thicker one, even though the latter one has a much larger surface area. This indicates that even though increasing the film thickness can obtain much more QDs-deposition on the photoanode, it also goes against the photo-generated electron transport and causes a serious recombination reaction between the photo-generated electron and the electrolyte.
 Fig. 7  Photocurrent–photovoltage (J–V) characteristics of QDSCs with various photoanodes (a), dark current–voltage characteristics of QDSCs with monolayers (b), double layers and multilayer (c). 
When the light scattering film was introduced into the transparent photoanodes, Jsc will be significantly increased from 11.31 mA cm−2 of T layer to 13.68 mA cm−2 of TS1 layer. And TS1 can present the best performance with 13.68 mA cm−2 of Jsc, 575 mV of Voc, 0.63 of FF and 4.92% of η, the photoactive area of which was 0.15 cm2. Furthermore, with increasing the amount of large particles in the scattering layers, the Jsc, Voc and η decrease gradually. It is thus implied that the augment of the cell performance is mainly attributed to the integrated effect of light scattering, namely, QDs deposition, photogenerated electrons transport in the TiO2 film as well as electrons recombination reaction. It is worth noting that a triple structure TS1S2 can only give a similar performance as TS2.
Concerning the effect of the scattering layer on QDSCs, Fig. 7(b) and (c) show the dark current–voltage characteristics of the CdS/CdSe QDSCs based on various photoanodes. In general, the magnitude and onset of dark current can be used to estimate the charge recombination which arises from the reduction of Sx2− ions by the photogenerated electrons.32,33 For the photoanodes only with transparent films, the dark current onset of TT film occurred at lower potential while the thinner film gave a smaller dark current at the same potential above 500 mV, meaning a relatively higher recombination rate for the thicker film. This is attributed to increasing the electron trapping sites with enhancing the thickness of the nanocrystalline TiO2 working electrode; thus, the Voc is lower than that for T film. For the photoanodes only consisting of scattering films, the S1 can give the smallest dark current whereas a similar situation of the other two films S2 and S3 was observed. When the transparent film and the scattering films are combined in double layer photoanodes, the dark current turns larger in the order of TS1, TS2 and TS3. The trend in Voc is in accordance with the dark current results: an increase in dark current is expected to cause a decrease in Voc. To the multiple layer photoanode TS1S2, the dark current is slightly larger than that for TS1.
3.5 Determination of the electron lifetime by OCVD method
In order to understand the effect of various photoanode structures on the electron lifetime, an open-circuit voltage-decay (OCVD) measurement was carried out. The OCVD technique is a newly developing method which consists of switching off the illumination in a steady state and monitoring the subsequent decay of photovoltage (Voc).34,35 It can provide some useful information about the electron recombination processes, typically the recombination of the photo-generated electrons with oxidized species in the electrolyte. Fig. 8(a) illustrates representative voltage decay curves of the QDSCs based on some monolayer, double layer photoanodes, respectively. And the electron lifetimes (τe) for these QDSCs under open-circuit condition (Fig. 8(b)) are estimated by the following equation: (2)where kBT is the thermal energy and e is the positive elementary charge. The exponential-like increase in the electron lifetime as decreasing the voltage is observed for all the QDSC samples under the open-circuit conditions, τe increases by two orders of magnitude when Voc decreases, starting at ∼0.5 V.17,35 Among the monolayer structures dealt with herein, the thinner transparent film (T) provides a longer electron lifetime value than the corresponding thicker film (TT) in the same voltage range under the open-circuit conditions. This is exactly the expected trend, since the surface area of the thicker transparent film will be remarkably augmented, leading to much more electron trapping sites and a faster charge recombination rate. To various scattering layers, the electron lifetime decreases with increasing the content of large particles, τe (S1) > τe (S2) > τe (S3), whereas the S1 layer can provide an almost identical electron lifetime with the transparent film T (below 0.35 V) under the open-circuit conditions. It indicates a higher content of large particles in the monolayers will strongly influence the electron lifetime and lead to a serious electron recombination. This might come from different recombination kinetics at the nanoparticle/electrolyte interface, that is, different crystal phase, particle size and morphology (300 nm rutile particles with a basically round shape versus 20 nm anatase particles with a cubic shape) will bring various recombination kinetics.36–38 To the photoanodes with a double layer structure, the TS1 photoanode can give almost the same electron lifetime as the transparent T, implying the introduction of scattering layers S1 onto the T layer do not lead to enhancement of the recombination between photo-generated electrons and oxidized species in the electrolyte. All these results are in excellent agreement to the photovoltaic performances (Table 2).

4. Conclusions
Aiming at improving the efficient assembly of the QDs onto the TiO2 photoanode, the influence of structural properties of various TiO2 photoanodes on the photovoltaic performance of CdS/CdSe-sensitized solar cells (QDSCs) has been systematically investigated. Our results revealed that unlike conventional DSCs, the main contribution of the scattering layer to QDSCs is adjusting the aperture distribution of TiO2 working electrode for CdS/CdSe deposition, extending the light path length and decreasing the electron recombination. In the meantime, an introduction of large size 300 nm TiO2 particles into the photoanode can achieve a wider pore size distribution from several nanometres to over 50 nanometres for effective CdS/CdSe coverage on the surface of TiO2 photoanodes as well as facilitating the polysulfide electrolyte penetration in the TiO2 films. Quantitative analyses of light-harvesting efficiency (LHE) and electron-transfer yield (ΦET) for the QDSCs are investigated for the first time. The results indicate that the LHE increases in the long wavelength region with the addition of large size TiO2 particles to the transparent film. In the meantime, the balance between the light scattering and surface area also needs to be taken into account. A double-layer photoanodic structure can give 4.92% of light-to-electricity conversion efficiency with 0.15 cm2 of photoactive area, which is the best result for the QDSCs so far. We believe that the conversion efficiency of QDSCs will be achieved by further optimization of the photoanodes with a new architecture and new morphology in the future.
