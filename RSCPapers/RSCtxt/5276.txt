    , Accepted 5th April 2020First published on 22nd April 2020AbstractElectron acceptors with a chemical structure of A–DA′D–A (in which A denotes an acceptor moiety and D a donor moiety) are rapidly gaining prominence in organic solar cells (OSCs). In OSCs containing these acceptors, record power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) exceeding 16% are now widely reported. Despite encouraging advances related to new material designs and PCEs, the fundamental interplay between molecular structure and device performance still requires further understanding. Here, we choose two model A–DA′D–A type acceptors, Y3 and Y18, that have almost identical structures, and examine how the presence of two extra alkyl chains (attached to the periphery of the DA′D core) in Y18 impacts on its solid state properties and device performance. These properties include: (i) charge transport; (ii) heat transfer; and (iii) electronic disorder. We found that bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) OSCs that use Y3 and Y18 have markedly different PCEs of ∼13 and 16%, respectively. Correspondingly, the BHJ containing Y18 possesses more efficient phonon transfer and charge transport and suppressed electronic disorder. Among these properties, the extremely low Urbach energy (EU) of 23 meV in Y18 stands out because this is even below the thermal energy (∼26 meV), which sets the electronic disorder limit at room temperature. With all these contrasting results, a simple molecular model can be rationalized in which the extra alkyl chains in Y18 help to suppress the formation of rotamers, endowing it with a disorder free molecular conformation and remarkable solid state properties. This work provides not only a new physical understanding of the effect of alkyl chains in organic semiconductors, but also new ideas for the synthesis of novel materials that can be adopted for use in high-performance OSCs.
1. Introduction
Research into bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs) has made encouraging progress and received a great deal of attention in the past few years.1–3 The most common active layer architecture for BHJ OSCs consists of a p-type electron-donating and an n-type electron accepting organic semiconductor.4–6 To date, considerable research efforts have been made towards developing varieties of acceptor (A)–donor (D)–acceptor (A) type non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs). Power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) have gained considerable momentum within the OSCs community with the development of new A–D–A based NFAs.7–12 However, a clear break emerged in early 2019 as Zou's group innovatively introduced electron-withdrawing units (A′) into the central (D) core to form an electron-deficient-core based (DA′D) fused structure.
In one kind of BHJ organic solar cell (OSC) based on these new A–DA′D–A type NFAs (e.g. Y6), a surprising PCE of 15.7% was reported.13 Since then, based on the Y6 molecule, significant efforts have been devoted to device engineering, structure modification and morphological optimization. Consequently, the PCEs of the OSCs with A–DA′D–A type acceptors have now exceeded 16% for binary14–17 and over 17% for ternary solar cells.18–20 All follow-up reports confirmed their excellent power conversion efficiency (PCE) performance and versatile application in the field of integrated photovoltaic (PV) markets.21–23 Despite these significant breakthroughs, the question remains as to what are the unique electronic properties behind different types of “Y series” acceptors that contribute to their sustainable enhanced performance is? Meanwhile, in addition to the molecular modifications and enhancement of the PCEs, very rare works have been carried out on their fundamental opto-electronic behaviors, although such properties could be the vital factors for driving their exceptional performance. Therefore, a systematic study of the solid state properties in the Y series acceptors and their correlation with the molecular structure is clearly needed to unravel their novelties and to further improve the molecular design of these promising OSC materials.
With these thoughts, in this contribution, we focus on two recently reported model NFAs, Y3 and Y18 (see Fig. 1a), with the A–DA′D–A molecular architecture. We examine how their: (i) charge transport; (ii) heat transfer; and (iii) electronic disorder can be correlated to their chemical structures and the device performance. Y18 and Y3 possess identical central core structures with the exception of an extra alkyl (n-hexyl) chain attached to the periphery of the core DA′D unit in the Y18 compound. As shown in Fig. S1 in the ESI,† the BHJ OSCs with Y3 can only attain a PCE of merely 13% while those with Y18 surpass 16%. The photovoltaic parameters of the solar cell devices are summarized in Table 1. Detailed information about the solar cell fabrication and performance optimization of the PM6:Y3 and PM6:Y18 photovoltaic devices has been reported by Zou's group elsewhere.14,23 We observed that the presence of the n-hexyl alkyl chain in Y18 is highly beneficial to the optoelectronic and thermal properties within the BHJ blend. Significantly higher electron mobility is achieved in an Y18-based BHJ film in stark contrast to the Y3-based BHJ. Correspondingly, the thermal diffusivity measurements, as probed by the scanning photothermal deflection (SPD), indicates a value that is almost two orders of magnitude higher for the Y18 based blend film than that for Y3. From the highly sensitive photothermal deflection spectroscopy (PDS) technique, we probed the near band-edge optical absorptions of the Y3 and Y18-based blend films. Our results reveal that both pristine Y18 and Y18-based BHJ possess an exceedingly small Urbach energy (EU) between 22–23 meV. This small EU is among the lowest values for solution processable semiconductors reported so far and is almost on a par with the high performance hybrid organic–inorganic perovskite compounds. On the other hand, the Y3 and Y3-based blend films have a much higher EU of about 29 meV, which is fully consistent with their morphologies. From the grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) results, the addition of the side chains at the β-position of the fused central core minimally affect the molecular orientation in both the pristine and blend films, but a higher crystallinity and more ordered packing were observed in the Y18 based films. Finally, all of the solid state properties and the morphology can be rationalized by a simple molecular model in which the n-hexyl chain in the core of the Y18 compound induces a definite conformation for the A–DA′D–A molecular architecture compared to Y3. Without the hexyl chain (in Y3), torsions between the core DA′D and the A units endow Y3 with unlocked molecular configurations. As evidenced by the results of GIWAXS, the better end-to-end stacking of Y18 originating from its fixed conformation is observed with a strong π–π overlap compared to that of Y3. The locked and disorder-free conformation facilitates electron and heat transfer, reduces the electronic disorder and enhances the device performance. This work offers a comprehensive study on the opto-electronic properties of the Y series acceptors and a definite guide for future material design of high performance OSCs.

2. Results and discussion
2.1 Charge carrier transport for bulk-heterojunctions
We first investigated the electron transport in the bulk-heterojunctions (BHJs) using electron-only devices. To explore the impact of the alkyl side chains of the electron-deficient-core based acceptors on the charge carrier transport within the blend films, BHJ films were prepared using the same donor material, PM6 (Fig. 1a). The Donor:Acceptor (D:A) weight ratio is 1:1.5, which is the same as the D:A ratio of the optimized solar cell device from the previous reports.23,24Fig. 1b summarizes the energy level. Fig. 1c and d show the absorption spectra of pristine Y3 and Y18 and their blend films with the donor material PM6. The electron-only device structure is given in Fig. S2 in the ESI.† Admittance spectroscopy (AS) was performed to extract the electron mobilities in the BHJs. The principle of AS for carrier mobility measurements has been described elsewhere.25,26 Fig. S3c in the ESI† shows the field-dependent electron mobilities for the PM6:acceptor BHJs. The full AS signals for the BHJ films can be found in the ESI in Fig. S4.†
The zero field mobility μ0,e can be extracted using the Poole–Frenkel (PF) model: μe(F) = μ0,eexp(βeF1/2), in which μ0,e is the zero-field electron mobility, F is the applied electric field, and βe is the associated PF slope.27 Detailed values of μ0,e and βe can be found in Table 2. Specifically, the Y18-based (with alkyl side chains) blend film has a μ0,e of 8.9 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is more than one order higher than that of PM6:Y3, which is 3.8 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1. In addition, PM6:Y18 achieves a reduced βe in the electron transport behavior, which means that the applied electric field F has a relatively weak influence on the electron mobilities. A smaller βe improves the electron transport in the low-field region, leading to electron mobilities of over 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 under different applied electric fields for the PM6:Y18 BHJ. In contrast, the electron mobilities μe in PM6:Y3 are reduced by about two orders from the short circuit to the open-circuit (zero-field) conditions because it has a highly field dependent electron transport property (larger βe).

The enhanced electron transport for Y18 can be further confirmed by the organic thin film transistor (OTFT) technique as well. Detailed thin film transistor (TFT) measurement and transport data can be found in Fig. S5 in the ESI.† Both the AS and the TFT results are in accordance with previous reports about the enhanced backbone ordering after attaching alkyl groups to the molecular main chain.28,29
2.2 Heat transfer in BHJ films
Heat conduction in solids is controlled by mobile charges and phonons.27,30 We therefore expect that an organic thin film with a higher charge carrier mobility and a more ordered structure should reveal more efficient heat transfer. In addition, it is known that the structural properties of the molecular/polymer chain could play an important role in determining its thermal conductivity.31,32 However, the correlation between the molecular structure and the heat transfer properties in the BHJ system has not been elucidated previously, especially for the emerging high performance OSC systems. Here, we employed a custom-made photothermal deflection setup and performed scanning photothermal deflection (SPD) on the BHJ films. The principle of SPD has been welldocumented elsewhere.33 Briefly, the sample under investigation is immersed in a transparent fluid. It is then irradiated by a modulated and focused laser beam (the pump beam). The absorbed laser energy induces a temperature rise across the sample surface. The temperature profile along the surface can be probed by scanning with an independent laser beam (the probe beam) just above the sample surface. The probe beam will be deflected because the adjacent fluid is heated up by the irradiated sample. By measuring the deflection versus the scanned distance (y) from the center of the pump beam, the surface temperature profile can be mapped out and the thermal diffusivity (D) of the BHJ film can be extracted. Fig. 2a and b show the selected SPD signals versus y curves for the PM6:Y3 and the PM6:Y18 BHJs. At the center with y = 0, the SPD signal is largest. On either side away from y = 0, the SPD signal drops rapidly and reaches a minimum. The separation (dn) between the two minima on either side can be used to deduce D by: (1)in which f is the modulated frequency of the pump beam.33Fig. 2c shows the normalized dnversus for two BHJ films. The intercepts in the y-axis of original plots (Fig. S6d and e†) is due to the beam size effect. The thermal diffusivity for pristine PM6 and full SPD spectra for the two blend films are given in Fig. S6 in the ESI.† The result shows that among the three samples investigated (PM6, PM6:Y3, PM6:Y18), the pristine polymer PM6 achieves the highest D of 2.64 mm2 s−1. The relatively large D in the polymer film is expected to arise from its long chain dominating morphology, as well as the higher degree of crystallinity.34 For the BHJ sample, PM6:Y18 has a D = 1.91 mm2 s−1 which is close to the pristine donor film. In sharp contrast, for the BHJ of PM6:Y3, D is 0.06 mm2 s−1 which is two orders smaller than that D of PM6:Y18. As discussed further below, the higher D value in Y18 may arise from: (i) the locked molecular conformation in the nanoscale; and (ii) the stronger π–π stacking and better crystallinity in the mesoscale. The fixed conformation and better end-to-end overlap improve the intramolecular and the intermolecular phonon transfer, respectively. In contrast, the more twisted conformation and the inferior π–π stacking of Y3 may give rise to excess phonon scattering events and thereby a suppressed heat transfer.35

The separation between the minima (dn) in the SPD signal can be used to determine the thermal diffusivity (D) of the BHJ film. (c) Variations in the normalized dn against  of the PM6:Y3 and PM6:Y18 films. The thermal diffusivity (D) of the corresponding films can be extracted from eqn (1). 
2.3 Electronic disorder for the BHJ films
A disordered semiconductor is known to possess an absorption band tail below the band gap Eg. The band tail absorption is usually very small. Here, we employed the highly sensitive PDS technique to characterize the tail state absorption of the BHJ films with Y3 and Y18. The principles of the PDS measurement have been well documented elsewhere.36Fig. 3a shows the PDS-derived optical absorption spectra of the two BHJ blends as a function of the incident photon energy. Distinct and abrupt drops in the absorption occur at about 1.3 eV, which coincide with the bandgap energies Eg. We note from Fig. 3 that Y3, Y18 and their BHJ possess excellent absorption values of approximately 105 cm−1 above Eg.13 Just below Eg, the absorption coefficient can be described using the Urbach equation: (2)in which α0 is the absorption coefficient at Eg, h is the Planck's constant, E is the incident photon energy, and EU is the Urbach energy. EU can be understood as a measure of the electronic disorder of a semiconductor, and it has been widely used to characterize the disorder in amorphous semiconductors. A summary of the extracted Urbach energy values can be found in Table 2. From the PDS results, the EU (27.7 meV) in the Y3-based BHJ film is clearly much higher than that of PM6:Y18 (22.4 meV). As EU is known to be related to the density of the localized states close to the band edge,37 the BHJ of PM6:Y18 must possess less localized states. The suppressed Urbach energy and the reduced localized states obtained from the PDS measurement are consistent with the above described observation of the improved transport properties in the Y18 based BHJ. In contrast, the higher Urbach energy in Y3 means that the mobile charges can be trapped in the localized states and need de-trapping via a larger electric field or thermal excitation, leading to the poor transport properties in the PM6:Y3 blend. In addition, we also probed the sub-bandgap absorptions for pristine donor (Fig. S7, ESI†) and acceptor films (Fig. 3b). It can be seen that the EU extracted from the pristine acceptor films follows a similar trend of Y3 > Y18. These results further confirm that the origin for the distinguishing EU in the corresponding BHJ films comes mainly from the acceptor materials. More importantly, we found that both of these two BHJs have a relatively small EU (≤30 meV), which is close to or less than the thermal energy kBT (∼26 meV) at room temperature. Fig. 3c shows a summary of the EU values for different types of OSC systems. The numerical EU values can be found in Table 3. In this work, we obtain an exceedingly small Urbach energy which is less than 23 meV for both the PM6:Y18 film and the Y18 pristine film. These values are even below the thermal energy (∼26 meV), which sets the electronic disorder limit at room temperature. To the best of our knowledge, both values are better than any other values previously reported for solution processable OSCs systems. Also, these values are comparable to those of the typical perovskite solar cell materials found in the literature, demonstrating the huge potential for fabricating high performance OSCs by using electron-deficient-core-based acceptors.

2.4 Morphologies of the BHJ films
Next, we address how the additional alkyl chains affects the thin film morphology. GIWAXS was employed to characterize the molecular orientation and the crystallinity of the Y3 and Y18-based BHJ films. The detailed GIWAXS patterns of the PM6:Y3 and PM6:Y18 blend film are shown in Fig. 4a and b, respectively. The in-plane (IP) and out-of-plane (OOP)

GIWAXS profiles of the two BHJs are shown in Fig. 4c and d respectively. In the IP reflection, it was found that the reflection located at qxy = 2.5–2.6 Å−1 is attributed to the PM6 (100) alkyl-chain stacking, while the peaks located at qxy = 4.33 and 4.38 Å−1 can be attributed to the Y3 and Y18 (100) alkyl-chain periodicity, respectively. As for the OOP direction, all of the BHJ films exhibit a strong π–π stacking peak in the OOP direction at qz = 17.65 Å−1 (d = 3.56 Å−1, PM6:Y3) and qz = 17.50 Å−1 (d = 3.58 Å−1, PM6:Y18), corresponding to the preferential face-on orientation of the two blend films.
Compared with the PM6:Y3, the BHJ film with Y18 exhibited much brighter and sharper diffraction peaks in both the IP and OOP direction, indicating a higher degree of crystallinity and stronger π–π stacking. The same packing trend was observed in the pristine acceptor film as well (Fig. S8, ESI†). The crystalline coherence length (CCL) in the π–π stacking direction of BHJ films was calculated from the full width at half maximum (FWHM) in the GIWAXS profile by following the Scherrer equation. As shown in Fig. S9 (ESI†), the PM6:Y18 and PM6:Y3 blend films exhibit a similar CCL (2.93 nm for PM6:Y3 and 2.79 nm for PM6:Y18). In addition, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were employed to characterize the arrangement and accumulation information for the PM6:Y18 and PM6:Y3 blend films. As shown in Fig. S10 (ESI†), when compared to a Y3 based film, a greater root-mean-square surface roughness (Rq) and slighter larger domains were observed in the PM6:Y18 blend film from the AFM and TEM patterns. These morphology features are in good agreement with the stronger intermolecular packing and the superior crystallinity in the Y18 based thin film demonstrated in the GIWAXS measurement.
Overall, the morphological studies indicate that within this NFA family: (i) variation in the alkyl side chains minimally affects the molecular packing behavior of the BHJ films (the preferential face-on orientation in the neat and blend films); (ii) introduction of the alkyl chains in Y18 can increase the interlamellar distance as expected; and (iii) the Y18 based film possessed strong π–π stacking and crystallinity.
Thus, these results, combined with the electrical and optical measurements, show that the improvement in the solid state properties in Y18 originate primarily from the better intermolecular π–π interaction. Furthermore, as discussed below, we will show that this behavior may be driven by the conformation differences in the alkylated TT-DFIC (Y18) versus that of the TT-DFIC (Y3).
2.5 Molecular model
In the Y3 acceptor, an electron-deficient fused core structure DA′D (=TT unit) is employed as the core and is connected at each end by A (=DFIC unit). The overall structure can be denoted by DFIC-TT-DFIC. The DFIC units can twist with respect to the rigid planar core TT (Fig. 5b). The rotational freedom leads to conformational diversities for the Y3 molecule.46 Attaching an extra hexyl chain to the β-position in the TT unit forms the Y18 acceptor and introduces steric hindrance for the rotation of the DFIC end groups. The resulting structure favors a locked molecular conformation along the conjugation backbone in which the S atoms in the core interact with the O atoms on the DFIC units as indicated in Fig. 5b. This molecular model has been supported previously by density-functional theory (DFT) calculations, as well as temperature nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements in a previous report.23 The current report connects the molecular model to the enhanced solid state properties for the PM6:Y18 BHJ in three regards (Fig. 5a).
 Fig. 5  (a) Electron mobilities, thermal diffusivities and Urbach energies of the PM6:Y3 and PM6:Y18 BHJs. (b) An illustration of the conformation of the Y3 molecule and alkyl-induced conformation lock in the Y18 molecule. For Y3, the A units (DFIC) can rotate with respect to the fused DA′D core. For Y18, steric hindrance from the hexyl chains blocks the rotation. A locked conformation is induced due to S⋯O atom interactions. 
(i) The fixed conformation occurs in the molecular level in the acceptor moiety of the BHJ. Thus, the electron mobility is expected to be boosted significantly when the acceptor is switched from Y3 to Y18. Furthermore, the reduced PF slope suggests the rate-limiting electron hopping conduction should be reduced because of the better π–π interactions between the acceptors with fixed conformations. On the other hand, as evidenced from GIWAXS, the stronger end-to-end stacking of Y18 generated from its locked conformation is observed with a stronger π–π overlap compared to that of Y3.
(ii) The heat transfer, as indicated by the thermal diffusivity D, is boosted significantly.
Adopting a simple kinetic model, D can be written in the form:47 (3)in which v is the phonon group velocity (speed of sound) and l is the phonon mean free path. For polymeric materials, v is in the range of 600–1500 m s−1.48 If we consider the PM6:Y18 BHJ, taking a mean v of about 1000 m s−1, the resulting l value is about 5 nm, which is roughly the same dimension as the length of two Y18 conjugated chains in tandem. This numerical estimation supports the notion that phonon transfer is over a conduction channel which has a better intra-molecular interaction as in Y18.
(iii) Y18 and PM6:Y18 possess an extremely low Urbach energy of about 23 meV. Previously, Abay et al. proposed that EU could be given by two terms:49 EU2 = kthEth2 + kstEst2(4)
In eqn (4), the first term results from the dynamical disorder, and it arises from the disorder caused by the thermally induced lattice vibrations. The second term is due to the static disorder, i.e., from the structural disorder.50 If we consider the difference between the EU of the Y3 and Y18 acceptors and their BHJ, the reduction of EU in Y18 can be attributed to the reduced static disorder. The fact that the overall EU for Y18 and its BHJ are as small as 23 meV suggests that their structural disorders are significantly reduced. The reduction originates from the elimination of different rotamers resulting in the preferentially locked conformation. The remaining disorder is dominated by the thermal disorder.
As a result, these Y acceptors, when properly designed, can be regarded as disorder-free electronic materials and must have broader and more important applications in the future.
3. Conclusions
We utilized two A–DA′D–A type fused ring acceptors (Y3 and Y18) to explore the relationship between the chemical structures of electron-deficient-core-based acceptors and their optoelectronic properties. The two small molecular acceptors have the same core unit and an additional alkyl side chain was introduced into the terminal of the Y18 core to fix the conformation. First, we characterized the charge transport properties of the two BHJs using AS and TFT techniques. Significantly higher electron mobility is achieved in PM6:Y18 BHJ owing to the efficient conduction pathways for electrons. In addition, the SPD technique was used to measure the heat diffusivities in the Y3 and Y18 based blend film. After the introduction of the alkyl side chains, the thermal diffusivity appears to be up to two orders of magnitude higher for the Y18 based blend film than for Y3. Furthermore, from a comparison of the Urbach energy measured using PDS, we established the relationship between the structural disorder and the tail state absorption in organic heterojunctions. The reduced structural disorder results in an extremely low Urbach energy of less than 23 meV in the Y18 based neat film and BHJ film. This Urbach energy is amongst the lowest reported in the literature for solution processed OSC materials. From the GIWAXS measurements, compared with Y3, the Y18 based films achieved stronger intermolecular π–π stacking and a higher degree of crystallinity. Ultimately, we have provided a molecular model to correlate the contrasting solid state properties and morphology with the conformation variations in these Y series acceptors. This study provides direct evidence for a correlation between the chemical structure, transport properties, and electronic disorder in high performance OSC system.
4. Experimental section
4.1. Materials and thin film fabrication
PM6 (Mn = 49 kDa) was purchased from Solarmer Energy Inc. Unless otherwise stated, all materials were used in the condition they were received, without further purification. Y3 and Y18 were developed by Prof. Zou's group. Chloroform and methanol were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. The BHJ active layer PM6:acceptors (D:A = 1:1.5, 16 mg mL−1 in total) were dissolved in chloroform (CF) and 1-chloronaphthalene (CN) (0.5%, v/v) and spin-cast at 3000 rpm for 30 s.
4.2. Electron-only device fabrication
The substrates were washed with detergents, and the leftover detergents attached onto the substrates were removed using a 90 °C Deconex cleaner bath which was prepared by mixing Deconex (Borer Chemie, Deconex 12 PA) and deionized (DI) water with a ratio of 1:20 in volume. The substrate was immersed in the bath for 10 min. Subsequently, it was transferred to an ultrasonic bath (Model Branson 2800) and further cleaned using DI-water, acetone and 2-propanal solvents. The solvent-treated substrates were dried for at least 12 h in a cleaning hood (Model Terra Universal 714/526-0100) with an ambient humidity of around 50–60% to fully evaporate the residual solvents. The electron-only devices have a structure of ITO/Al/BHJ/PDINO/Al. A 50 nm Al layer was deposited onto the ITO-based substrates to block the hole carriers. The BHJ layers was spin-coated on the top of the ITO/AL in the glove box. Then, the PDINO layer (0.5 mg mL−1 in total) was dissolved in methanol and spin-cast at 3500 rpm for 40 s. The thickness of BHJs were kept in the range of ∼200–500 nm and 5 nm for the PDINO layer. The substrates with BHJs were then transferred into a high vacuum chamber (∼4 × 10−6 torr) and evaporated using a 130 nm Al electrode.
4.3. Admittance spectroscopy measurements
For the AS measurement, carriers were injected into the BHJ film when a DC voltage was applied on the device under test. A small AC voltage was superimposed on the DC as perturbation. The DC signal was applied using a supply (Model Manson Engineering Industrial, DPS-3030), and the AC modulation was supplied by an impedance analyzer (Model Hioki 3535-50 LCR Meter).
4.4. Photothermal deflection spectroscopy
The PDS measurements were carried out with a 1 kW Xe arc lamp and a 1/4 m grating monochromator (Oriel) as the tunable light source. The pump beam was modulated at 13 Hz using a mechanical chopper before irradiating the sample. Perfluorohexane was used as the deflection fluid. A Uniphase HeNe laser was directed parallel to the sample surface as the probe laser. A quadrant cell (United Detector Technology) was used as the position sensor for monitoring the photothermal deflection signal of the probe beam. The output of the detector was fed into a lock-in amplifier (Stanford Research, Model SR830) for phase-sensitive measurements. All PDS spectra were normalized to the incident power of the pump beam.
4.5. Scanning photothermal deflection
The SPD measurement was conducted in a dark room. The sample was immersed in the deflection fluid perfluorohexane in a cuvette. A 2 mW 632 nm He–Ne laser mounted on a fixed holder was used as the probe beam. A 5 mW 532 nm YAG laser diode mounted on a motorized linear translation stage was used as the pump beam. The motorized linear translation stage was controlled by a stepper motor driver, which was powered by a 5 V 1 A dc supply. By sending digital signals to the stepper motor driver, one can adjust the separation between the probe beam and pump beam. A convex lens with a 20 cm focal length for focusing the pump beam onto the sample was mounted on the pump beam holder, so that the lens could move together with the pump beam. The pump beam was modulated by a mechanical chopper with an adjustable chopping frequency. A silicon PIN photo quadrant detector (TEMic) with a 6 V reverse bias was used to detect the deflection of the probe beam. The mechanical chopper and position sensor were connected to a Standford Research SR830 lock-in amplifier.
4.6. GIWAXS measurements
All of the GIWAXS measurements were carried out at BL14B1 beamline, Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF) with a two-dimensional Mar225 detector. All of the samples were fabricated on Si substrate and measured in ambient air. The wavelength of the X-ray was 1.24 Å (10 keV) and an incidence angle of 0.15 was adopted together with a distance of 393 mm from the sample stage to the detector.
