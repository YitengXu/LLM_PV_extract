    , Accepted 20th April 2016First published on 21st April 2016AbstractAn ethanolamine (ETA)-functionalized fullerene (C60-ETA) was synthesized by using a facile one-pot addition reaction, and applied as an efficient electron transport layer (ETL) for inverted polymer solar cells (iPSCs) with the efficiency exceeding 9.5%, which represents the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) reported so far for iPSC devices with independent fullerene derivative ETLs. The chemical structure of C60-ETA was studied by FT-IR and XPS spectroscopies and elemental analysis, and the average molecular formula of C60-ETA is estimated to be C60(NHC2H4OH)8(H)8 with an average ETA addition number of eight. C60-ETA was applied as an ETL for bulk heterojunction (BHJ) iPSC devices based on different photoactive layers including poly[4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-co-3-fluorothieno[3,4-b]thiophene-2-carboxylate]:[6,6]-phenyl C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PTB7-Th:PC71BM), poly(4,8-bis-alkyloxybenzo(l,2-b:4,5-b′)dithiophene-2,6-diylalt-(alkyl thieno(3,4-b)thiophene-2-carboxylate)-2,6-diyl) (PBDTTT-C):PC71BM and poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl):[6,6]-phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester (P3HT:PC61BM), leading to the best PCE of 9.55%, 6.50% and 4.18%, respectively, which are all higher than those of the corresponding reference devices based on the ZnO ETL. The PCE improvement of the C60-ETA device relative to that of the ZnO device primarily originates from the increase of short-circuit current density (Jsc), which is due to the smoothened ETL surface and the increase of electron mobility, facilitating electron transport from the active layer to the ITO cathode.
Introduction
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) have become promising renewable energy devices due to their advantages of light-weight, high flexibility and low cost.1 In the past decade, tremendous efforts made on the synthesis of novel conjugated polymer donors and fullerene acceptors, nanoscale morphological control and interface engineering have led to a dramatic increase of the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of single-junction PSCs exceeding 10%.2 In order to improve further the performance of PSCs to meet the future commercialization requirement, an interface engineering approach, i.e., modulating the interface between the donor(acceptor) and electrodes, appears quite facile and effective to promote charge transport and extraction by means of lowering the energy level offsets between the donor(acceptor) and electrodes via inducing interfacial charge redistribution.3
Inverted polymer solar cells (iPSCs), in which the bottom transparent electrode such as ITO serves as the cathode whereas the top electrode is the anode, are more advantageous than conventional-structure PSCs because of the higher environmental stability and higher flexibility in the design of multi-junction PSCs.4 An electron transport layer (ETL) introduced between the active layer and cathode is generally needed and crucial for selectively transporting electrons and blocking holes for iPSCs.3 In recent years, inorganic metal oxides such as zinc oxide (ZnO) have been popularly applied as an efficient ETL for iPSCs with the advantages of low-cost, environmental friendliness, good stability, good transparency and variability of the preparation approaches toward different morphological requirements. However, most of metal oxide layers are sensitive to the surface adsorption of oxygen and UV-irradiation, and a thermal annealing treatment is usually required to improve their ETL performance.5,6 Thus, developing alternative ETL materials such as organic semiconductors avoiding thermal annealing treatment is highly desired. To date several types of organic ETL materials have been reported, including water/alcohol soluble conjugated polymers such as poly[(9,9-bis(3′-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9–dioctylfluorene)] (PFN),7 non-conjugated polymers8 and π-conjugated small molecules.9 In particular, owing to the strong electron-accepting ability and the structural similarity to the widely used fullerene acceptors in PSCs, fullerene derivatives are beneficial for electron transport and can thus be applied as ETLs, while so far only a few studies on using fullerene derivatives as ETLs replacing the inorganic interfacial layer for iPSCs have been reported.10–13 For instance, a phosphate group functionalized fullerene derivative bis-[6,6]-phenyl-C61-pentyl phosphoric diethyl ester (B-PCPO) was used as an ETL material by Huang et al., which effectively improved the electron collection of the ITO electrode by decreasing the work function of ITO, and resulted in an increase of the PCE of iPSC devices based on the PCDTBT:PC71BM active layer from 4.83% to 6.20%.6b To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest PCE reported so far for iPSC devices with independent fullerene derivative ETLs. Another PC61BM-like fullerene derivative, an amine-based [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid 2-((2-(dimethylamino)ethyl)(methyl)-amino)-ethyl ester (PCBDAN) and its ammonium salts showed self n-doped properties, and iPSC devices based on the PCBDAN ETL exhibited comparable PCEs to those with the ZnO ETL.10a,11 More recently, conductive fulleropyrrolidinium iodide (Bis-OMeFPI) with good tunability of the work function of ITO was synthesized by Jen et al. Upon blending bis-OMeFPI with ethoxylated polyethyleneimine (PEIE) as a hybrid ETL, the PCE of the PBDTT-TT:PC71BM-based iPSC device reached 9.62%, while the PCE of the iPSC device using the pure fullerene derivative bis-OMeFPI was unknown.12 It is noteworthy that, these reported fullerene derivative ETLs generally need multistep synthesis, and in some cases they require post-treatments such as additive blending and thermal annealing, limiting their potential applications in large-area PSCs.6a,12,13 Therefore, a facile synthesis of novel fullerene derivative ETLs rivaling inorganic metal oxides is still challenging.
Herein, we synthesized a novel ethanolamine (ETA)-functionalized fullerene (C60-ETA) via a facile one-pot nucleophilic addition reaction, and applied it as an independent ETL for iPSCs. The chemical structure of C60-ETA was investigated by FT-IR and XPS spectroscopies and elemental analysis. The performance of the C60-ETA ETL for BHJ-iPSC devices based on versatile active layers, including poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl):[6,6]-phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester (P3HT:PC61BM), poly(4,8-bis-alkyloxybenzo(l,2-b:4,5-b′)dithiophene-2,6-diylalt-(alkyl thieno(3,4-b)thiophene-2-carboxylate)-2,6-diyl):[6,6]-phenyl C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PBDTTT-C:PC71BM) and poly[4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-co-3-fluorothieno[3,4-b]thiophene-2-carboxylate] (PTB7-Th):PC71BM, was studied and compared with that of the ZnO ETL, and the factors responsible for the effectiveness of the C60-ETA ETL were revealed.
Results and discussion
The high nucleophilicity of a primary amine makes its addition with C60 feasible.14 C60-ETA was synthesized via a facile one-pot nucleophilic addition reaction by simply heating a mixture of ethanolamine (ETA) and C60 at 80 °C for 1 hour as shown in Scheme 1. Similar to the cases of the reported nucleophilic additions of primary aliphatic amines with C60,15 C60-ETA forms through a single-electron transfer from ETA to C60 as the first step followed by a deprotonation and radical recombination.16 Under these reaction conditions, the primary aliphatic amine group of ETA reacts with C60 preferentially because the amine group has stronger nucleophilicity than the hydroxyl group. According to our spectroscopy characterization discussed below, we deduce that C60-ETA is a mixture composed of multi-addition products with variable numbers of ethanolamine groups (i.e., n value). This is understandable because of the high reactivity of N–H addition retarding a precise control of the reaction conditions (stoichiometry, temperature, time etc.).15b,17 We then made attempts to isolate individual components via column chromatography but failed because of the nearly identical polarities of different components. This is quite similar to the case of the well-known fullerenol C60(OH)n, which generally exhibits a large distribution of grafted hydroxyl groups.10b,18

The chemical structure of C60-ETA was investigated by FT-IR and XPS spectroscopies and elemental analysis. In the FT-IR spectrum of C60-ETA (see ESI Fig. S1†), two characteristic vibration peaks of C60 were found at 1459 and 526 cm−1, suggesting the retention of C60 in the derivative. For the grafted ETA groups, the vibration peaks at 3408, 1381 and 1056 cm−1 correspond to the hydroxyl groups at the end of the ETA moiety, confirming that C60 preferentially reacts with the primary aliphatic amine group of ETA instead of the hydroxyl group (see Scheme 1). The N–H scissor vibration, C–N stretching vibration and C–H stretching vibration are observed at 1634, 1113 and 2938/2848 cm−1, respectively.10b,17
In order to estimate the average molecular formula of C60-ETA, we carried out XPS spectroscopy and elemental analysis. The XPS survey spectrum of C60-ETA is shown in Fig. 1a, indicating the intense signals of C1s, N1s, and O1s. The C1s peak of C60-ETA can be deconvoluted into three peaks at 284.4, 285.8, and 287.8 eV (Fig. 1b), which are assigned to C–C, C–H, and C–N bonds, respectively. In the high-resolution N1s spectrum, two characteristic peaks at 398.5 and 399.8 eV are found (Fig. 1c), which are assigned to C–N and N–H bonds within the ETA moiety. Besides, two peaks at 530.0 and 531.7 eV, assigned to C–O and O–H groups, respectively,19 are found in the high-resolution O1s spectrum, confirming further the retention of the hydroxyl groups. On the basis of the atomic ratio of C1s and N1s, the average molecular formula of C60-ETA is estimated to be C60(NHC2H4OH)8(H)8 (see ESI Table S1†). Furthermore, according to the elemental analysis, the weight percentages of C, N and H are 78.43%, 9.69% and 5.12%, respectively, and thus the average addition number of ETA is estimated to be eight. This agrees well with the average molecular formula of C60-ETA estimated on the basis of the XPS results.

Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) was then carried out in a N2 atmosphere to investigate the thermal stability of C60-ETA (see ESI Fig. S2†). Four agravic processes are observed, including: (1) removal of the adsorbed solvent (∼4.78%, <95 °C); (2) removal of ETA molecules remaining in the C60-ETA crystal lattice (13.07%, 164–244 °C); (3) detaching of the grafted ETA moiety (13.63%, 244–498 °C); (4) decomposition of the C60 cage (more than 12.67%, >498 °C). It is noteworthy that, the relatively high thermal stability of C60-ETA confirmed by the retention of the grafted ETA moiety up to 244 °C ensures its application in iPSCs for which thermal annealing treatments up to 135 °C are generally needed to improve the film quality of the active layer such as P3HT:PC61BM.20
Since C60-ETA is to be used as the ETL for the iPSC device through which solar light passes prior to the active layer, its transparency is a vital factor for the device performance. The transmittance spectrum of ITO/C60-ETA (∼7 nm thick, measured by using a KLA-Tencor P6 surface profilometer) prepared by spin-coating C60-ETA solution in methanol onto a ITO substrate is compared with bare ITO, indicating that the C60-ETA layer hardly affects the transmittance of ITO which exceeds 80% in the region of 420–900 nm (see ESI Fig. S3†), thus fulfilling the prerequisite for application as the ETL of iPSCs.
The film formation properties of C60-ETA were studied by atomic force microscopy (AFM) in the tapping mode. The AFM height image of ITO/C60-ETA prepared by spin-coating C60-ETA solution in methanol onto the ITO substrate shows a smooth film with a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 0.66 nm (see ESI Fig. S4†), which is quite comparable to that of the bare ITO substrate (0.69 nm), suggesting that C60-ETA molecules can form a uniform film without aggregation on the ITO substrate. This makes the follow-up fabrication of the active layer feasible. In contrast, upon spin-coating the conventional ZnO ETL onto ITO, the film exhibits a RMS roughness of 1.73 nm, which is much larger than those of bare ITO and ITO/C60-ETA. Thus, whether such a difference in the roughnesses of ITO/C60-ETA and ITO/ZnO substrates would affect the roughness of the active layer film should be addressed as discussed further below.
To study the effectiveness of C60-ETA as the ETL, we fabricated BHJ-iPSC devices in a glovebox with the structure of ITO/C60-ETA ETL/active layer/MoO3/Ag in which C60-ETA was incorporated as a novel ETL (Fig. 2a). We first incorporated the C60-ETA ETL into the high-efficiency iPSC devices based on a low bandgap donor material such as poly[4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-co-3-fluorothieno[3,4-b]thiophene-2-carboxylate] (PTB7-Th) blended with [6,6]-phenyl C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) (see Fig. 2a). The current density–voltage (J–V) curve of a PTB7-Th:PC71BM device based on the C60-ETA ETL is shown in Fig. 2b, which includes also that of a reference device based on the conventional ZnO ETL for comparison, and the measured parameters (short-circuit current (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), FF (fill factor), PCE, series resistance (Rs), and shunt resistance (Rsh)) are summarized in Table 1. The reference device based on the ZnO ETL (device B) shows a Voc of 0.78 V, a Jsc of 15.98 mA cm−2, a FF of 67.5%, and an average PCE of 8.37% (the best PCE was 8.61%), which are comparable to the reported values of the BHJ-iPSC devices fabricated under similar conditions (chlorobenzene as the solvent).2a,2c,21 Upon applying C60-ETA to substitute the ZnO ETL, the average PCE of the PTB7-Th:PC71BM device (device A) increases dramatically to 9.26% calculated from a Voc of 0.78 V, a Jsc of 17.43 mA cm−2, and a FF of 68.5%. Compared to the ZnO ETL-based device, the device based on the C60-ETA ETL exhibits a PCE enhancement of ∼10.6%, indicating that C60-ETA is superior to ZnO while its preparation is more facile and its ETL incorporation avoids a thermal annealing treatment. It is noteworthy that, the best PCE of the C60-ETA device reaches 9.55%, which is much higher than that based on the fullerene derivative B-PCPO ETL reported in ref. 6b, and thus represents the highest PCE of iPSC devices with independent fullerene derivative ETLs.

To investigate the universality of the C60-ETA ETL in different active layer systems, we fabricated analogous C60-ETA-incorporated devices based on two other active layer systems, including poly(4,8-bis-alkyloxybenzo(l,2-b:4,5-b′)dithiophene-2,6-diylalt-(alkyl thieno(3,4-b)thiophene-2-carboxylate)-2,6-diyl)(PBDTTT-C):PC71BM and poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT):[6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM). Compared to the reference devices based on the ZnO ETL with PCEs of 5.78% and 3.56% for PBDTTT-C:PC71BM (device D) and P3HT:PC61BM (device F), the corresponding devices based on the C60-ETA ETL exhibit PCEs of 6.25% (device C) and 4.05% (device E) (see Fig. 2c and d and Table 1). Thus, similar to the case of the PBT7-Th:PC71BM system discussed above, incorporation of the C60-ETA ETL leads to obvious PCE enhancements by ∼8.3% and 13.8% for PBDTTT-C:PC71BM and P3HT:PC61BM systems, respectively, compared to the devices incorporating the ZnO ETL. Hence, the universality of the C60-ETA ETL in different active layer systems is confirmed, promising its practical application in PSCs.
Among the three photovoltaic parameters determining the PCE, it is found that the PCE enhancement of the C60-ETA device relative to that of the ZnO one mainly originates from the increase of Jsc for all three active layer systems, whereas Voc remains almost constant and FF exhibits only negligible increases (<5%) (see ESI Fig. S5†). In order to confirm the increase of Jsc upon C60-ETA substituting the ZnO ETL, we carried out external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements under ambient conditions for the devices with different ETLs and the spectra are shown in Fig. 3. For all three active layer systems, the EQE response onsets are consistent with the absorption onsets of the corresponding conducting polymer donors including PBT7-Th, PBDTTT-C and P3HT (see ESI Fig. S6†). For the device based on PTB7-Th (Fig. 3a), apparently the EQE response of the C60-ETA device is much higher than that of the ZnO one in almost the entire response region and exceeds ∼57% in the broad region of 400–740 nm. In contrast, the ZnO device exhibits quite a low EQE response (<45%) in the UV region and the response in the visible region is also lower than that of the C60-ETA device. While this comparative study reveals clearly the increase of the EQE response upon C60-ETA substituting the ZnO ETL, it should be noted that, however, similar to the cases reported in the literature,2a,22 the integrated Jsc from the EQE spectrum is a little smaller than the Jsc measured in a glovebox under AM 1.5 condition likely due to the inevitable performance decay of the unencapsulated devices in air. Interestingly, similar results are observed for PBDTTT-C:PC71BM and P3HT:PC61BM systems despite the overall lower EQE responses than that of the PBT7-Th:PC61BM system, confirming that substituting ZnO by the C60-ETA ETL indeed results in the obvious increase of the EQE value, and this agrees well with the increase of Jsc for the C60-ETA device relative to that of the ZnO one.
 Fig. 3  EQE spectra of the ITO/C60-ETA (or ZnO) ETL/active layer/MoO3/Ag BHJ-iPSC devices based on different active layer systems including PBT7-Th:PC71BM (a), PBDTTT-C:PC71BM (b), and P3HT:PC61BM (c). 
The surface morphologies of the PTB7-Th:PC71BM, PBDTTT-C:PC71BM and P3HT:PC61BM active layer films fabricated on ITO/C60-ETA and ITO/ZnO substrates were studied by AFM in the tapping mode (Fig. 4). The PTB7-Th:PC71BM active layer film on the ITO/C60-ETA substrate exhibits distinct donor- and acceptor-rich domains with a RMS roughness of 1.83 nm (Fig. 4A), whereas the overall morphological feature of the film on the ITO/ZnO substrate looks similar despite the larger RMS roughness (1.96 nm, Fig. 4B). Similar phenomena are observed for PBDTTT-C:PC71BM and P3HT:PC61BM active layer films, with RMS decreasing from 1.85 to 1.78 nm and 8.33 to 7.29 nm, respectively, upon substituting ZnO by C60-ETA (see Fig. 4C–F). Therefore, it can be concluded that, compared to the ZnO ETL, the C60-ETA ETL induces a smoother active layer film for all three systems, and this seems naturally due to the smoother surface of ITO/C60-ETA than the ITO/ZnO substrate as discussed above. Since the interfacial contact between the active layer and electrode is determinative for efficient charge transport and extraction,23 the smoothening of the active layer may improve the interfacial contact and consequently the charge transport as discussed below.

UV-Vis absorption spectra of PTB7-Th:PC71BM, PBDTTT-C:PC71BM and P3HT:PC61BM active layer films spin-coated on ITO/C60-ETA and ITO/ZnO substrates are compared in ESI Fig. S6,† indicating that the optical absorptions of all three active layer films based on the C60-ETA ETL are comparable to those based on the ZnO ETL. These results suggest that, although the active layer films on the ITO/C60-ETA substrate are slightly smoother that those on ITO/ZnO, such a small difference in the roughness does not affect the optical absorption of the film. Therefore, the contribution of the optical absorption to the increase of Jsc for C60-ETA devices can be ruled out.
Since Jsc is dependent not only on the multiplication of the photo-induced charge carrier density and the charge carrier mobility within the active material but also on the interface properties between the active layers and the electrodes,1–3,24 we then studied the effect of the C60-ETA ETL on the electron mobility (μe) of the active layer. The electron-only ITO/ETL/active layer/Ca/Al devices were fabricated for measuring μe from the J–V curves shown in Fig. 5 by using the space charge limited current (SCLC) method.25,26 The μe value is calculated from the Mott–Gurney equation (eqn (1)):26 (1)where JSCLC stands for the current density, V is the applied potential, L is the thickness of the active layer (100, 100, and 170 nm for PTB7-Th:PC71BM, PBDTTT-C:PC71BM and P3HT:PC61BM), εr is the relative dielectric constant of the blend (assuming 3.5), and ε0 is the permittivity of free space (8.85 × 10−12 C V−1 s−1). The measured μe values are summarized in ESI Table S2.† For the PTB7-Th:PC71BM system, the calculated μe value of the C60-ETA device is 5.54 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is significantly higher than that of the ZnO device (1.51 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1). Likewise, the measured μe values of C60-ETA devices based on PBDTTT-C:PC71BM and P3HT:PC61BM systems are 4.19 × 10−4 and 9.60 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, which are also much higher than those of the corresponding ZnO devices (1.58 × 10−4 and 1.27 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, see ESI Table S2†). These results suggest that the electron transport properties of the device are improved upon C60-ETA substituting the ZnO ETL, contributing directly to the increase of Jsc.

For iPSC devices with a given active layer system, the work function of ITO determines the interfacial contact between the active layer and ITO cathode and consequently the electron extraction by the ITO cathode.27 The effect of C60-ETA on the work function of ITO was investigated by scanning Kelvin probe microscopy (SKPM) measurements, from which the work function of a interfacial material can be estimated according to the interfacial dipole change induced by the interfacial layer assuming that the surface potential of the film is uniform in the macroscopic scale.24,28 Based on the comparison of the surface potential values of ITO/C60-ETA and ITO/ZnO, we found that the surface potential of ITO/ZnO is only ca. 18 mV more negative than that of ITO/C60-ETA (see ESI Fig. S7 and Table S3†). Thus, the work function of the ITO/C60-ETA is estimated to be 4.37 eV, decreased by ca. 18 meV relative to that of ITO/ZnO, which is estimated to be 4.39 eV (see Fig. 6). Therefore, similar to the case of ZnO, incorporation of the C60-ETA ETL results in the decrease of the work function of ITO, consequently the energy offset between the work function of ITO and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital level (LUMO) of the PC61BM/PC71BM acceptor decreases (see Fig. 6), benefiting an ohmic contact formation at the ITO/acceptor interface.24,27 This would facilitate electron extraction from the PC61BM/PC71BM acceptor by the ITO cathode, accounting for the effectiveness of C60-ETA as the ETL. In this sense, since the work function of ITO/C60-ETA is comparable to that of ITO/ZnO, the electron extraction ability of ITO/C60-ETA is expected to be comparable to that of ITO/ZnO, and thus the contribution of electron extraction to the increase of Jsc upon C60-ETA substituting the ZnO ETL is likely minor.
Conclusions
In summary, C60-ETA synthesized via a facile one-pot nucleophilic addition reaction was successfully applied as a novel ETL for iPSCs, affording a high PCE exceeding 9.5%, which represents the highest PCE reported so far for iPSC devices with independent fullerene derivative ETLs. The chemical structure of C60-ETA was studied by FT-IR and XPS spectroscopies and elemental analysis, and the average molecular formula of C60-ETA is estimated to be C60(NHC2H4OH)8(H)8 with an average ETA addition number of eight. By incorporating the C60-ETA ETL into BHJ-iPSC devices based on different active layer systems including PTB7-Th:PC71BM, PBDTTT-C:PC71BM and P3HT:PC61BM, the best PCEs reach 9.55%, 6.50% and 4.18%, respectively, which are all higher than those of the corresponding reference devices based on the ZnO ETL, indicating that C60-ETA rivals the popularly used ZnO in terms of the ETL performance. The PCE enhancement primarily originates from the increases of Jsc, which is attributed to the smoothened ETL surface and the increase of electron mobility, facilitating electron transport from the active layer to the ITO cathode. The facile synthesis of C60-ETA and its effectiveness as a universal ETL with the advantage of low-temperature solution-processability enable its potential application in PSCs.
Experimental
Materials
C60 was purchased from Suzhou DCN Co., Ltd. Zinc acetate dihydrate (C4H6O4Zn·2H2O, 99%), 2-methoxyethanol (HOCH2CH2OCH3, 99%) and ethanolamine (HOCH2CH2NH2, ETA, 99%) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. P3HT, PBDTTT-C, PTB7-Th, PC61BM, and PC71BM were bought from Luminescence Technology Corp., Solarmer Material Inc., One Material, Nichem Fine Technology Co., Ltd. and Solenne BV., respectively. All chemicals were used as received without further purification.
Synthesis of C60-ETA
C60 (18 mg, 0.025 mmol) was mixed with ETA (6 ml, 0.1 mol) and heated at 80 °C under N2 for 1 h. Then the unreacted C60 and ETA were sequentially removed by centrifugation and rotary evaporation. The residue was washed by using acetone three times and treated twice with ether (Et2O) by washing. After that, the residue was dried in a vacuum at 70 °C overnight, yielding a dark brown powder (12.3 mg).
Device fabrication
Our detailed fabrication procedure of the reference BHJ-iPSC devices based on the ZnO ETL has been reported previously.25 In brief, the ITO-coated glass substrate with a sheet resistance of 10 Ω □−1 (purchased from Shenzhen Nan Bo Group, China) was ultrasonicated in detergent, deionized water, acetone and isopropanol for 15 min every time, and subsequently dried in an oven at 60 °C overnight. 0.1 M zinc acetate dihydrate was dissolved in a solution mixture of 2-methoxyethanol (10 ml) and ethanolamine under stirring for 10 hours at 60 °C for the hydrolysis reaction. The ZnO precursor solution was spin-coated onto the cleaned ITO-coated substrate at 2000 rpm for 30 s, and then heated at 200 °C for 10 min in N2 and 200 °C for 60 min in air to form a ZnO film (∼40 nm thick, measured by using a KLA-Tencor P6 surface profilometer).30 For the preparation of the C60-ETA ETL, C60-ETA was dissolved in methanol to form a solution with a concentration of 0.5 mg ml−1, and was spin-coated onto the ITO substrates at 2500 rpm for 40 s to form a C60-ETA film (∼7 nm thick, measured by using a KLA-Tencor P6 surface profilometer). On the top of the C60-ETA or ZnO film, a thin active layer (∼100 nm thick) of PTB7-Th:PC71BM (1:1.5, w/w) or PBDTTT-C:PC71BM (1:1.5, w/w) was prepared by spin-coating its solution in chlorobenzene/1,8-diiodooctane (97:3 v/v) or o-dichlorobenzene/1,8-diiodooctane (97:3 v/v), respectively, in an argon-filled glovebox. For P3HT:PC61BM devices, P3HT:PC61BM (1:0.8, w/w) dissolved in o-dichlorobenzene was spin-coated onto the C60-ETA or ZnO layer at 800 rpm for 60 s in a glovebox, followed by evaporation of the o-dichlorobenzene solvent in a vacuum for 2 hours to form a thin active layer (∼170 nm thick, measured by using a KLA-Tencor P6 surface profilometer), and then the P3HT:PC61BM film was annealed at 135 °C for 10 min. Finally, the device was transferred into a vacuum chamber (∼10−5 Torr), and MoO3 (∼10 nm) and the Ag electrode (∼100 nm) were sequentially deposited thermally atop the active layer. The active areas of the PTB7-Th:PC71BM, PBDTTT-C:PC71BM and P3HT:PC61BM devices are all defined as 2 × 5 mm2.
For the SCLC measurements, electron-only devices were fabricated as follows: 0.1 M zinc acetate in a solution mixture of 2-methoxy ethanol and ethanolamine was spin-coated onto the ITO substrates at 2000 rpm for 60 s, followed by heating at 200 °C for 10 min in N2 and 200 °C for 60 min in air to form a ZnO film. The C60-ETA dissolved in methanol was spin-coated onto the ITO substrate at 2500 rpm for 40 s. The active layer was spin-coated onto the ZnO or C60-ETA layer, and the devices with P3HT:PCBM were annealed at 135 °C for 10 min. Finally, 10 nm Ca/100 nm Al was deposited sequentially atop the active layer in a vacuum chamber (∼10−5 Torr) with a defined active area of 2 × 5 mm2.
Measurements and characterization
Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were recorded as KBr pellets on a TENSOR 27 spectrometer (Bruker, Germany) at room temperature. Elemental analysis was performed in a vario EL cube of elemental analyzer. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) curves were recorded on a TGA Q5000 instrument under a nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were recorded on a ESCALAB 250 instrument. UV-Vis spectroscopy spectra were recorded on a UV-Vis-NIR 3600 spectrometer (Shimadzu, Japan).
The thickness of the film was measured by using a KLA-Tencor P6 surface profilometer. AFM measurements were carried out on a Veeco DI-Multimode V scanning probe microscope using the tapping mode. SKPM measurements were carried out on the same microscope using the SKPM mode. All samples were measured by the same tip to avoid any change in the tip's work function. A standard HOPG measurement was carried out as a reference prior to the measurement of each sample so as to avoid the possible variation resulting from the tip and the atmosphere.
The current density–voltage (J–V) characterization of BHJ-iPSC devices was carried out by using a Keithley 2400 source measurement unit under simulated AM 1.5 irradiation (100 mW cm−2) with a standard xenon-lamp-based solar simulator (Oriel Sol 3A, USA). The solar simulator illumination intensity was calibrated by using a monocrystalline silicon reference cell (Oriel P/N 91150 V, with KG-5 visible colour filter) calibrated by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). All the measurements were carried out in a glovebox and a mask with a well-defined area size of 10 mm2 was attached onto the cell to define the effective area so as to ensure accurate measurements. More than ten devices were fabricated and measured independently under each experimental condition to ensure the consistency of the data, and the average data as well as the best performance were used in the discussions. EQE spectra were measured in air using an ORIEL Intelligent Quantum Efficiency (IQE) 200™ Measurement system established with a tunable light source powered by using a xenon-lamp (150 W).
