The composition ratio and calcining conditions have been optimized by orthogonal experiments. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and structure refinement were performed to analyze the phase composition and the changes of cell parameters. Intense characteristic emissions of Er3+ ions were observed when excited with CW laser radiation at 980 nm, 1064 nm and 1550 nm, which show that the obtained samples possess the outstanding advantage of application generality in the infrared detection field.

1. Introduction
Upconversion materials have many interesting applications, such as upconversion lasers,1,2 infrared quantum counters,3 adsorbents for coloured effluents,4 fluorescent bioimaging agents,5–7 laser lighting or displays,8 solar cells,9,10etc. A large number of 980 nm upconversion materials have been studied systematically;11–13 for example, Takayuki Hirai's group14 and Timur Sh Atabaev's group15 prepared Gd2O3:Yb,Er phosphors by using the emulsion liquid method and the urea homogeneous precipitation method, respectively, and they measured the upconversion emissions under the 980–990 nm excitation and studied the two-photon absorption luminescence mechanism, aiming at a luminescent reporter in the field of bioluminescence. However, only a few 1064 nm and 1550 nm upconversion materials were reported; for example, Jianguo Deng16 reported that the dopant of La3+ would promote the upconversion luminescence of TiO2:Er,Yb excited at 1064 nm; Vermelho17 and Ri Su-Hyon18 studied the upconversion emissions of Er-doped tellurite glasses and Y2O2S:Er3+,Yb3+ phosphor, respectively, when excited at 1540–1550 nm.
Because 980 nm, 1064 nm and 1550 nm are the popular working wavelengths in the near-infrared band, both the study of luminescence properties and the study of the physical mechanism of the multi-wavelength sensitive upconversion materials are important in multi-wavelength infrared detection. Oxysulfide up-conversion phosphors possess the outstanding advantages of low phonon energy, high upconversion efficiency and excellent stability; therefore they have attracted much attention in the past 10 years.19 Herein, we synthesized the Er3+–Yb3+ co-doped gadolinium oxysulfide phosphor by a coprecipitation–solid state reaction process and will discuss its multi-wavelength sensitive upconversion luminescence.
2. Experimental
Preparation
Gd2O2S:Er3+,Yb3+ upconversion phosphors were synthesized through the coprecipitation–solid state reaction method. The purity of the rare earth oxide starting material erbium oxide (Er2O3), ytterbium oxide (Yb2O3), and gadolinium oxide (Gd2O3) was 99.999% and that of sodium carbonate (Na2CO3), oxalic acid (C2H2O4) and sulfur (S) was of analytical grade. The oxide precursor was synthesized by the coprecipitation process, and the procedure was as follows: Gd2O3, Er2O3 and Yb2O3 were dissolved in 8 mol L−1 nitric acid to obtain the rare earth nitrate solution mixture, and then the 0.5 mol L−1 oxalate solution was dropped into the solution mixture until it was precipitated completely (adjusting the pH to 5). After leaving the solution to stand for 5–6 hours, suction filtration, washing with water and absolute ethyl alcohol, and drying in an oven at 80 °C, the ultrafine rare earth oxide precursor was obtained, and it was calcined sequentially.
Orthogonal experiments were carried out in order to optimize the calcining technological parameters. Orthogonal standard table L16 (44) was adopted, and the experiments were carried out in accordance with the layouts of the orthogonal array (wherein the Er-to-Yb concentration ratio was one to five). S and Na2CO3 were added to the above rare earth oxide precursor to be ground thoroughly, then this mixture was put into a muffle to calcine, under a mild reducing atmosphere, at a certain temperature for a certain length of time to get the Gd2O2S:Er3+,Yb3+ phosphor.
Measurements
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were performed using a Rigaku D/max 2500 PC diffractometer at a step of 0.02° with a standing time of 2 s per step in the 2θ range from 10° to 120°, and Cu Kα1 (λ = 0.15406 nm) was used as the radiation source, with an accelerating voltage of 20 kV and a working current of 10 mA. The structure refinement was done using the General Structure Analysis System (GSAS) program. A SHIMADZU RF-5301PC fluorescence spectrometer coupled with a laser with different excitation sources at 980 nm, 1064 nm and 1550 nm was utilized to test the IR up-conversion spectra of the samples, and the intensity–power curves were tested with the help of a series of optical attenuators.
3. Results and discussion
Optimization of the calcining parameters by using the orthogonal experiments
It is well known that the upconversion luminescence intensity and the red/green emission ratio are closely related to the Er3+ doping concentration and Yb3+/Er3+ concentration ratio, especially for excitation at 1550 nm. Considering application generality (980 nm, 1064 nm and 1550 nm), the Yb3+/Er3+ concentration ratio was set 5:1. The general formula of the sample can be represented as (Gd1−6xErxYb5x)2O2S.
Na2CO3 was adopted as a fluxing agent. It can react with S to form intermediate products to promote the synthesis reaction, improving the structural integrity of the product lattice. And the reaction equations are as follows:20    
Experiments were carried out in accordance with the layouts of the L16 (44) orthogonal array, and then all of the spectra of samples excited at different wavelengths were tested (as shown in Fig. 1–3). The excitation source of SHIMADZU RF-5301PC fluorescence spectrometer was replaced with an infrared laser with an optical fiber output. It would be noticed that the head of the optical fiber should be fixed in the same position in each test in order to guarantee the same excitation power density, which was 1.6 W cm−2 for 980 nm, 160 mW cm−2 for 1064 nm and 180 mW cm−2 for 1550 nm. The equal mass powder was pressed under the same conditions to form thin sheets in order to decrease the effect of diffuse scattering of powder particles.

 Fig. 2  Upconversion spectra of L16 (44) orthogonal samples for the excitation at 1064 nm. 
 Fig. 3  Upconversion spectra of L16 (44) orthogonal samples for the excitation at 1550 nm. 
It can be seen that all of the spectra exhibit the characteristic emission peaks of Er3+ ions. The orthogonal analysis results are listed in Table 1, with the sum of the red and green emission intensities excited at different wavelengths as the evaluation index (shown as the ratio of the intensity of each sample to the intensity of the optimal sample in Table 1). k1−, k2−, k3− and k4− are the mean values of the corresponding intensity. It can be found in Table 1 that the optimum conditions resulting from the different-wavelength orthogonal analysis are inconsistent; for example, it is A4 B3 C1 D2 for the excitation at 980 nm, it is A3 B3 C1 D2 for the excitation at 1064 nm and it is A2 B4 C2 D4 for the excitation at 1550 nm. By contrast, the upconversion luminescence intensity excited at 980 nm and 1550 nm is stronger than that excited at 1064 nm; therefore, the determination of the optimum conditions should take the specific application requirements into account. If the dominant green emissions are considered, the ideal conditions should coincide with the optimal conditions determined by orthogonal analysis, which can be known from the green/red ratio of the samples (as shown in Table 2). Take the 980 nm excitation, for example, the green/red ratios of the no. 11 sample and the no. 16 sample are 12 and 14, respectively, while the ratios of the other samples are 17–20. However, not only the green/red ratio but also the intensity value should be taken into consideration.

980 nm, 1064 nm and 1550 nm are the popular working wavelengths in the near-infrared band. If all of the above three infrared wavelengths are considered, the ideal conditions can be chosen as A3 B3 C2 D2 (1050 °C, 3.0 h, the Er3+ concentration is 2%, the Yb3+ concentration is 10%, m(Gd2O3):m(S):m(Na2CO3) = 10:4.5:3.5), then, these determined conditions were adopted to prepare the sample in order to test and analyze its structure and properties, and its formula can be represented as (Gd0.88Er0.02Yb0.1)2O2S.
Phase identification and crystal structure
The XRD pattern of the (Gd0.88Er0.02Yb0.1)2O2S sample is shown in Fig. 4 in comparison with the standard peak positions of the Gd2O2S hexagonal phase (JCPDS card no. 26-1422). The XRD results show that the solid solution is formed and the sample is in a hexagonal Gd2O2S structure with the space group Pm1(164). The Er3+ and Yb3+ ions are expected to efficiently dissolve in the Gd2O2S host lattice by replacing the Gd3+ sites; thus, no other phase or impurity phase can be detected.

Fig. 5 shows the observed, calculated, and difference patterns of the (Gd0.88Er0.02Yb0.1)2O2S phosphor. The final refinement converged with weighted profiles of χ2 = 1.84, Rp = 9.77% and Rwp = 13.03%, thus revealing the good quality of the refinement. Fig. 6 is the crystal structure of Gd2O2S. There is only one coordination type of Gd3+, and each metal atom Gd seems to be bonded to four oxygen atoms and three sulfur atoms to form a seven coordination polyhedron.

 Fig. 6  Crystal structure representation of Gd2O2S. The left figure is coordination of Gd3+ ions and the right is Gd–O–S coordination polyhedron. 
It can be seen from the XRD patterns that the diffraction peaks have shifted right slightly in comparison with the peak positions of the standard card (no. 26-1422). It is because the difference in ionic radius between Er3+ (0.0881 nm)/Yb3+ (0.0858 nm) and Gd3+ (0.0938 nm) results in unit cell shrinkage. Considering that Gd2O2S is of a hexagonal structure, the interplanar crystal spacing d can be calculated as the following equation: (1)
The unit cell shrinkage will cause the decrease of d and the consequent right shift of those diffraction peaks. The original cell parameters of Gd2O2S are 3.852 Å × 3.852 Å × 6.667 Å <90 × 90 × 120>, while the cell parameters of (Gd0.88Er0.02Yb0.1)2O2S are a = b = 3.813 Å, c = 6.616 Å, α = β = 90° and γ = 120°, which are calculated from the above refinement of the XRD pattern.
Luminescence mechanism analysis
Experiments have proved that the emission spectrum of the trivalent rare earth doped upconversion material changes along with the matrix categories and excitation power.21 It is known that for unsaturated upconversion processes, the number of photons which are required to populate the upper emitting state can be obtained by the following relation:22 Ivis = PnNIR(2)where Ivis is the fluorescence intensity, PNIR is the pump laser power, and n is the number of pump-photons required to populate the emitting state.

Fig. 7(a) shows the measured power dependence of the three upconversion emissions of Er3+ ions excited at 980 nm at room temperature for the (Gd0.88Er0.02Yb0.1)2O2S sample. The results are illustrated in the ln–ln plots, and the values of slopes for the ~520 nm green emission, ~550 nm green emission and ~660 nm red emission are 2.06, 1.89 and 1.92, respectively. The results indicate that the two-photon process is mainly responsible for the observed up-converted emission for the excitation at 980 nm. The dependences excited at 1064 nm and 1550 nm are illustrated in the ln–ln plots in Fig. 7(b) and (c). The green and red emissions exhibit a sub-square (1.90 and 1.97) power-law behavior for the excitation at 1064 nm and a sub-cubic (2.88 and 3.08) power-law behavior for the excitation at 1550 nm, which indicate that two pumping photons around 1064 nm and three pumping photons around 1550 nm participate in the upconversion excitation process, respectively.
 Fig. 7  The ln–ln plots of the green and red emissions versus excitation power. (a) Excited at 980 nm, (b) excited at 1064 nm and (c) excited at 1550 nm. 

Fig. 8 shows the simplified Yb3+–Er3+ energy-level diagram of the 980 nm upconversion luminescence of the sample. It has been known from the above I–P curves that all of the 520 nm, 550 nm and 660 nm emissions originate from the two-photon absorption process. First, the electrons can be pumped from the Er3+ ground state 4I15/2 to its excited 4I11/2 level, through the direct absorption of Er3+ ions or the energy transfer between Yb3+ and Er3+ ions. The energy difference between the 2F5/2 level and the 2F7/2 level of Yb3+ ions and the energy difference between the 4I15/2 level and the 4I11/2 level of Er3+ ions are approximately equal to 10300 cm−1, and also the absorption cross-section of Yb3+ is greatly larger than that of Er3+; therefore the population of the 4I11/2 (Er3+) level is mainly realized by the Yb3+–Er3+ energy transfer process (ETU). Similarly, Er3+ ions can be promoted from the 4I11/2 level to the 4F7/2 level through another ETU process, that is 2F5/2(Yb3+) + 4I11/2(Er3+) → 2F7/2(Yb3+) + 4F7/2 (Er3+) (②). Er3+ ions at the 4F7/2 level might relax to the 2H11/2 and 4S3/2 levels by the fast multiphonon process. Then, the radiative decay from the 2H11/2 and 4S3/2 levels to the ground state 4I15/2 generates green UC luminescence around 520 nm and 550 nm, respectively.
 Fig. 8  Er3+–Yb3+ energy level diagram with the proposed UC mechanisms excited at 980 nm. 
Red UC luminescence for the excitation at 980 nm results from 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 transitions. The population mechanism of the 4F9/2 level is relatively complicated, and it includes nonradiative relaxation23 and cross-relaxation processes.18,24 Er3+ ions at the 4S3/2 level possibly undergo a non-radiative relaxation process to reach the 4F9/2 level, or Er3+ ions at the 4I11/2 level can firstly relax nonradiatively to the next lower 4I13/2 level and then transit to the 4F9/2 level through the Er3+–Yb3+ energy-transfer process (③). In addition, the 4F9/2 state can also be populated via the 4F7/2(Er3+) + 4I11/2(Er3+) → 2 4F9/2(Er3+) (④) cross-relaxation process.

Fig. 9 shows the simplified Yb3+–Er3+ energy-level diagram of the 1064 nm upconversion luminescence of the sample. The green and red emissions of Er3+ ions result from the two-photon absorption process (as shown in Fig. 7(b)). Er3+ ions at the 4I15/2 level can directly absorb 1064 nm infrared light to transit to the 4I11/2 level, and it can be seen from the Gd2O2S:Er,Yb absorption spectrum reported by Ajithkumar10 that 1064 nm light can also be absorbed partially by Yb3+ ions; therefore the population mechanism of the 4I11/2 (Er3+) level includes both the Er3+ ground state absorption (GSA) process and the Yb3+–Er3+ energy-transfer upconversion (ETU) process. Once in the 4I11/2 level, the following energy-transfer, nonradiative relaxation and cross-relaxation processes are similar to that of 980 nm excitation.
 Fig. 9  Er3+–Yb3+ energy level diagram with the proposed UC mechanisms excited at 1064 nm. 

Fig. 10 presents the energy-level diagram of the 1550 nm upconversion luminescence of the sample. The green and red emissions of Er3+ ions result from the three-photon absorption process (as shown in Fig. 7(c)). Yb3+ ions cannot absorb 1550 nm infrared light, while Er3+ 4I15/2 → 4I13/2 transitions can match up with the energy at 1550 nm; hence the UC luminescence should depend on the Er3+ absorption process and the Er3+–Er3+ energy-transfer process. When excited by 1550 nm infrared light, Er3+ ions are promoted from the ground state 4I15/2 to the first excited state 4I13/2 (①). Population of higher Er3+ excited states can be realized by the excited state absorption (ESA) process and/or the ETU process. As far as high Er3+ dopant concentration is concerned, the ETU process is dominant, that is 4I13/2(Er3+) + 4I13/2(Er3+) → 4I15/2(Er3+) + 4I9/2(Er3+) (②).25,26 Similarly, Er3+ ions can be promoted from the 4I9/2 state to the 2H11/2 state through the ETU process, that is 4I9/2(Er3+) + 4I13/2(Er3+) → 2H11/2(Er3+) + 4I15/2(Er3+) (③). Er3+ ions at the 2H11/2 state might relax to the 4S3/2 level by the fast multiphonon process. Then, the radiative decay from the 2H11/2 and 4S3/2 states to the ground state generates green UC luminescence around 520 nm and 550 nm, respectively. Er3+ ions at the 4S3/2 state might relax non-radiatively to the 4F9/2 state. Furthermore, as far as those Er3+ ions promoted to the excited state 4I9/2 are concerned, considering the short lifetime of the 4I9/2 state (around 16 μs) and the small energy gap between 4I9/2 and 4I11/2 levels (around 2000 cm−1), it is clear that fast multiphonon relaxation to the 4I11/2 level occurs. After the population of the 4I11/2 level, the 4F9/2 emitting state is populated via the 4I11/2(Er3+) + 4I13/2(Er3+) → 4F9/2(Er3+) + 4I15/2(Er3+) ETU process giving rise to red UC emission bands centered at ~660 nm.17

Spectral analysis
Ajithkumar and his group studied theUV-Vis-NIR absorption spectrum of the Gd2O2S:Er,Yb sample as shown in Fig. 11.10 From their measured result, it can be seen that there are absorption bands of the Yb3+ ion corresponding to 2F7/2 → 2F5/2 transitions in the 900–1100 nm range and the absorption bands of the Er3+ ion corresponding to 4I15/2 → 4I13/2 transitions around 1500 nm.

Fig. 12 shows a series of upconversion spectra excited at various wavelengths. All three spectra exhibit the Er3+ characteristic green and red emissions. The emission peaks at ~520, ~550 nm and ~660 nm correspond to the 2H11/2 → 4I15/2, 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 and 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 transitions, respectively. The emission spectra excited at 980 nm and 1064 nm are characterized by an intense green band followed by a weaker red band, while the emission spectrum excited at 1550 nm presents an intense red band. The 4I15/2 → 4I13/2 transitions of Er3+ ions match the energy of 1550 nm infrared light very well; therefore the 4I13/2 level is populated easily, and subsequently the 4I9/2 level is populated through the ETU and/or ESA process. The Er3+ ions at the 4I9/2 level would be likely to transit nonradiatively to the 4I11/2 level because of the short lifetime of the 4I9/2 level, and then followed by the 4I11/2 → 4F9/2 transitions through the ETU process. In conclusion, the population of the 4F9/2 level for the excitation at 1550 nm is apparently higher than that for the excitation at 980 nm and 1064 nm, and then the Er3+ red emission at ~660 nm resulting from 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 transitions becomes stronger.

The ~520 nm emission peaks have not been observed in the spectra excited at 1064 nm and 1550 nm. Though the 2H11/2 level can be firstly populated by the ETU process and the multiphonon relaxation process, energy level depopulation occurs immediately through 2H11/2 → 4S3/2 non-radiative transitions because the band edge of the S2−–Er3+ charge transfer state (CTS) is lower than that of the 2H11/2 level, which leads to an efficient population of the 4S3/2 state; therefore, under the low exciting power, a small amount populated the 2H11/2 level. That is why the 2H11/2 → 4I15/2 transitions (~520 nm emission) have not been observed in the two spectra excited at 1064 nm and 1550 nm.27,28
Furthermore, it can be seen from the spectrum excited at 980 nm that split peaks exist because of the high exciting power. The green emission which is due to the 2H11/2 → 4I15/2 transitions shows Stark levels at 523, 528 and 533 nm, the ~550 nm emission (4S3/2 → 4I15/2) shows Stark levels at 546 and 555 nm, and the ~660 nm emission (4F9/2 → 4I15/2) shows Stark levels at 655, 660 and 669 nm.
The number of Stark energy level splitting can be calculated by group theory.29 In the case of high excitation energy, every single energy level can split into several Stark levels, which can be expressed as a linear combination of irreducible representation. The space group of hexagonal Gd2O2S is Pm1. The total angular momentum quantum number J of Er3+ is semi-integer; hence the energy level splitting can be represented by the character equation of the bi-group, then the Er3+ ground state 4I15/2 can be calculated as:  where χ is the group character, ± denotes the parity under the inversion operation, Rθ is the rotation angle along the rotation axis, and J is the total angular momentum quantum number. The calculated group characters of Er3+ ground state 4I15/2 are as follows: E = 16, C2 = 0, C3 = −1, C4 = 0, in which E = 2J + 1. Compared with the group–group character table, the linear combination of irreducible representation is:30Γ(J=15/2) = 5Γ4 + 2(Γ5 + Γ6)
The above combination formula means that Er3+ ground state 4I15/2 could split into 2 Stark energy levels in this crystal field. Similarly, the linear combinations of irreducible representation of 2H11/2, 4S3/2 and 4F9/2 are:Γ(J=11/2) = 4Γ4 + 2(Γ5 + Γ6)Γ(J=3/2) = Γ4 + (Γ5 + Γ6)Γ(J=9/2) = 3Γ4 + 2(Γ5 + Γ6)
That means all of the excited 2H11/2, 4S3/2 and 4F9/2 levels of Er3+ ions could split into 2 Stark energy levels in the hexagonal Gd2O2S crystal lattice; therefore, up to four transitions of different wavelength can be obtained between each of the above excited level and the ground state. The upconversion spectrum excited at 980 nm (Fig. 12(a)) is basically in line with the calculated results.
Conclusions
Er3+–Yb3+ codoped Gd2O2S infrared upconversion phosphor was synthesized via the coprecipitation–solid state reaction process. The ideal synthesis conditions, calcined at 1050 °C for 3.0 h, with Er3+ and Yb3+ dopant concentrations of 2% and 10% and mass percent of m(Gd2O3):m(S):m(Na2CO3) = 10:4.5:3.5, were determined through L16 (44) orthogonal experiments. XRD and structure refinement were performed to analyze the phase composition and the changes of cell parameters, and the results show that the sample is of a hexagonal Gd2O2S structure and the cell parameters have changed to 3.813 Å × 3.813 Å × 6.616 Å <90 × 90 × 120> from 3.852 Å × 3.852 Å × 6.667 Å <90 × 90 × 120>. The multi-wavelength sensitive upconversion luminescence mechanisms were studied by means of the ln–ln plots of the intensity–power (I–P) curve. The result of the I–P test shows that the upconversion luminescence under the 980 nm and 1064 nm excitations can be attributed to the two-photon process, while that of 1550 nm can be attributed to the three-photon process.
