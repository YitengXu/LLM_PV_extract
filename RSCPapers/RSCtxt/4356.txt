    , Accepted 18th February 2013First published on 7th March 2013AbstractHierarchical TiO2 spheres (HTSs) composed of thin nanosheets with a high ratio of exposed (001) facets were prepared by solvothermal reaction of titanium precursor under the mediation of HF and glacial acetic acid (HAc). The size of the spheres and the density of primary nanosheets could be effectively tuned by simply adjusting HAc dosage. The as-prepared HTSs were highly crystallized and demonstrated high BET surface area, but decreased apparently after calcination due to the collapse or fusion of the primary nanosheets. The calcinated HTSs were further applied as scattering layers in photoanodes of dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Compared with the monolayered nanospindle (NS) photoanode with similar thickness, the bilayered photoanodes with the HTSs as scattering layers offered dramatically higher photocurrent density (Jsc) and therefore higher energy conversion efficiency (η). Due to the highest scattering effect and the lowest charge transfer resistance (Rct) at TiO2–dye–electrolyte interface, the DSSC with H2 (synthesized with HAc volume of 2 mL) as scattering layer offered η of 7.72%, which is 42% higher than that based on the monolayered NS photoanode.
Introduction
Anisotropy is the intrinsic characteristics of polar crystals. The electronic structure, dangle bond, superficial energy and polarity at each group of facets are quite different, therefore, the crystals with exposure of different facets exhibit abundant and peculiar optical, catalytic and electrochemical properties.1 Hence, various nanocrystals or polyhedrons with selective facets have attracted great interests for pursuing of enhanced or novel application performances. Anatase TiO2 is a versatile wide band gap semiconductor material that can be potentially applied in water splitting, photocatalysis, gas-sensing, energy conversion/storage, etc.2–6 In an anatase TiO2 crystal, (001) facets are the most reactive surface, whereas (101) facets are the most stable surface according to the surface energy of 0.9 and 0.42 J m−2 for them,7 hence the equilibrium shape of anatase TiO2 crystal adopts truncated octahedron with exposure of about 94% (101) facets and less than 6% (001) facets according to Wulff construction.8 The acquirement of highly reactive (001) facets can greatly improve the surface related adsorption or catalytic capabilities. Subsequent to the theoretical calculation and experiment by stabilizing of (001) facets with F− ions to afford 47% (001) facets exposed decahedron,9 a series of investigations have shown that higher ratio of exposed (001) facets can dramatically enhance the photocatalytic activity,10–16 and the photocatalytic selectivity of (001) facets exposed anatase TiO2 can be further tuned by surface treatments.17,18 Moreover, (001) facets exposed anatase TiO2 also benefits the insertion and faster transfer of Li+, affording higher performance in lithium ion batteries.19,20
Anatase TiO2 is also an important photoanode material in DSSC, the main function of TiO2 photoanode is to adsorb dyes and transfer the photoelectrons. The high coordination unsaturation of Ti4+ on (001) facets facilitates the readily and tightly chemisorb of dyes, so that higher dye adsorption capacity can be achieved,21 which further favors higher Jsc and therefore higher η. Yu et al. employed (001) facets enclosed nanosheets as photoanode materials of DSSC and achieved higher Jsc and η than that based on TiO2 octahedrons.22 Lu and coworkers reported that higher ratio of (001) facets can enhance the dye adsorption capacity and retard the charge recombination, achieving higher photovoltaic performance.23 HTSs with exposed (001) facets as photoanode material could also offer enhanced photovoltaic performance.24–27 Given the generally high specific surface area and scattering effect of HTSs, as well as the strong coordination unsaturation of Ti4+ on (001) facets, HTSs with high ratio of (001) facets is thought of as a promising photoanode material in DSSCs. Furthermore, owing to the high surface energy, (001) facets exposed primary units in HTSs are more inclined to fuse together face-to-face by calcination for sake of minimize the surface energy. The tight inter-sphere connection in this manner offers direct electrons transfer paths across adjacent spheres with less crystal boundaries, which is especially significant for application as scattering layer in photoanode films. Previous scattering materials are mainly microspheres composing of nanoparticles or nanorods,28–31 the inter-sphere connection and countless crystal boundaries to some extent subject to the smaller contact area between spheres. Therefore, application of (001) facets exposed HTSs as scattering layer of photoanode in DSSC deserves to be expected, and the underlying relationship between the structure and photovoltaic parameters is also intriguing.
Herein, HTSs assembled by (001) facets exposed nanosheets were synthesized by solvothermal reaction using tetrabutyl titanate (TBT) as precursor and HF and HAc as directing regents. The diameter of HTSs and the density of primary nanosheets could be effectively tuned by altering HAc dosage. The application of HTSs as scattering layer substantially enhanced the scattering effect of photoanodes and decreased the recombination at TiO2–dye–electrolyte interface, and finally improved the photovoltaic performance of DSSCs. The preservation of nanosheets units and the suitable diameter of 300 nm endowed H2 with well charge transfer ability and scattering effect, both of which are beneficial for application as scattering layer in photoanode. The DSSC using H2 as scattering layer offered the highest η over other photoanodes.
Experimental
Preparation of HTSs composing of TiO2 nanosheets
In a typical synthesis of H2, 14.2 mL of diglycol was added to a plastic baker, 0.5 mL TBT was added into the solution under stirring to form a clear solution. Subsequently, 0.3 mL HF (40%) and 2 mL HAc was added to the above solution and stirred for 20 min. The reaction solution was transferred into a 25 mL Teflon-lined autoclave and heated at 180 °C for 8 h. After being cooled to room temperature, the precipitate was collected and washed repeatedly with deionized water and ethanol, then dried at 60 °C for 12 h. To investigate the dosage of HAc on the morphology and property of the product, controlled experiments were also tried by the same process while altering the HAc volume to 1 mL and 5 mL, and the products were denoted as H1 and H5, respectively according to HAc volume.
Fabrication of DSSCs
NS with length of 90 nm and diameter of 38 nm was synthesized by hydrothermal treatment of Degussa P25 in 10 M NaOH and followed by solvothermal treatment in mixed solvents.32 To fabricate monolayered photoanode, 200 mg of NS was mixed with 60 mg polyethylene glycol (Mw = 20000) and grounded in an agate mortar under the supplementary of HAc for 2 h to form a viscous slurry, and the slurry was spread onto clean fluorine-doped tin oxide conductive glass flakes (FTO, NSG, Japan) by doctor-blade method to form the film with thickness of 20 μm and active area of 25 mm2. After dried naturally, the coated FTO glass flake was calcinated at 450 °C for 30 min. The bilayered photoanodes with the same thickness and active area were prepared by coating a NS bottom layer with thickness of 12 μm and covering 8 μm of HTSs over the NS layer, and the photoanodes were denoted as NS–H1, NS–H2 and NS–H5 according to scattering layer materials. The photoanodes were immersed in 0.3 mM N719 ethanol solution for 24 h to sensitize the photoanodes. Platinized FTO formed by thermo-decomposition of H2PtCl6 at 380 °C was used as counter electrode. The resulting DSSCs were produced by assembly of photoanodes with counter electrodes. The electrolyte containing 0.3 M 1, 2-dimethyl-3-propyl imidazolium iodide (DMPII, Geao Co. Ltd., Wuhan), 0.5 M LiI, 0.05 M I2, and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine in 3-methoxypropionitrile, was capillarily injected into the cells for further photovoltaic measurements.
Characterizations
The morphology and structure of the products were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, HITACHI, S4800), high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, JEOL JEM-2100), X-ray powder diffractometry (XRD, Bruker D diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation, λ = 0.1542, 40 kV, 100 mA). The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) specific surface area and Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) pore size distribution of the products were measured on a Micromeritics Gemini 2380 surface area analyzer at 77 K with N2 gas as adsorbate. The optical diffuse reflection spectra of the photoanodes were recorded on a Saifan spectrophotometer equipped with an integrating sphere (Internal DRA-2500). The dye sensitized photoanodes were rinsed with 0.1 M NaOH water–ethanol solution, and the dye adsorption capacities of photoanodes were estimated according to the absorbances of elutes.
Photocurrent–voltage (I–V) measurements of the cells were performed on a Keithley 2400 sourcemeter under the illumination of xenon lamp solar simulator (Newport) with light strength of 100 mW cm−2 (AM 1.5). The incident monochromatic photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) was measured using 7-scspec solar cell spectra test system with a 1/4 m monochromator (Saifan, China). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was recorded under open-circuit condition and AM 1.5 illumination using a potentiostat (EG&G, M283) equipped with a frequency response detector (EG&G, FRD100). The curves were scanned from 100 kHz to 10 mHz at room temperature. The alternating voltage amplitude was set at 10 mV.
Results and discussion
Morphologies and structures
The HTSs containing nanosheets with high ratio of (001) facets were synthesized by controlled hydrolysis of titanium precursor in the presence of HF and HAc. The effect of HF or TiF4 volume on the exposure ratio of (001) facets have previously reported,10,23,24 herein, we mainly investigated the dosage of HAc on the morphology of the products. Fig. 1 shows the SEM of H1, H2 and H5, the three products all exhibit flower-like hierarchical spheres, which are accumulated by irregularly arranged primary nanosheets with different density. As for H1 (Fig. 1a and b), the hierarchical microspheres are ca. 200 nm in diameter, which are assembled by sparsely arranged nanosheets with the thickness of ca. 6 nm and the side length of up to 150 nm. The increase of HAc volume results in the increase in sphere diameter and the density of primary nanosheets. As shown in Fig. 1c and d, the mean diameter of H2 increases to ca. 400 nm and the primary nanosheets are more densely arranged in the microspheres, and the side length of the primary nanosheets increased accordingly whereas the thickness remains almost unvaried. Detailed observation reveals that the primary nanosheets are not strictly planar, some of them are slightly curl, evidencing the flexibility of the nanosheets, which is presumably due to the thin thickness of nanosheets, the high surface charge makes the sheet flexible, this phenomenon is common in the ultrathin sheets.5 Further increase of HAc volume leads to much larger spheres containing much denser primary nanosheets. From Fig. 1e and f, the diameter of H5 is enlarged to ca. 2 μm, and the primary nanosheets are closely packed with each other to form the hierarchical spheres, which can also be verified by the high contrast of the spheres in TEM image (Fig. S1, ESI†).

More detailed structural information of the hierarchical spheres was obtained by TEM. Fig. 2a shows the low magnification TEM image of H2, the hierarchical spheres are constructed by radially arranged nanosheets. The low contrast of the primary nanosheets against background reveals that the nanosheets are very thin. The jagged border of the spheres facilitates the interlacement of the adjacent spheres, which could improve the connectivity when the HTSs were made into photoanode films.33 Moreover, the primary nanosheets can offer shorter electron transferring pathways.24 Both of these features are favorable for the application of this type of material in photoanode of DSSC. Fig. 2b presents the HRTEM of an individual sheet perpendicular to the electron beam direction, two set of lattice fringes perpendicular to each other can be clearly observed, the lattice spacing are both 0.19 nm, which represents the (200) and (020) planes of anatase TiO2, this reveals that the top and bottom surface of the nanosheets are (001) facets. The cross-section of the nanosheet reveals the thickness of the nanosheet is ca. 6 nm (Fig. 2c). The inter-fringe spacing parallel to the top and bottom surface is measured to be 0.235 nm, which coincides with the interlayer distance of (001) facets in anatase TiO2, and further confirms that both sides of the sheet are (001) facets. Considering the side length and the thickness of the primary nanosheets, the surface of the spheres are overwhelmingly enclosed by (001) facets, which takes up 93% of the total surface area.

HF is widely accepted as the main species to stabilize the highly reactive (001) facets, for the passivation of (001) facets by F− anions can greatly lower the surface energy of (001) facets and inhibit the growth along <001> crystallographic orientation, hence high ratio (001) facets are exposed. In this case, diglycol acted as a chelating agent to form stable diglycol chelated titanate to control the hydrolysis or acidolysis, the acidolysis of diglycol chelated titanate in HAc affords Ti(diglycol)x(Ac−)y intermediates,34 the hydrolysis of the titanium complex and the following dehydration at high temperature affords anatase TiO2. During these processes, the passivation of (001) facets by F− anions inhibits the crystal growth along <001> orientation and forms the deeply truncated nanosheets, the final assembly of nanosheets results in the HTSs. With the increase of HAc dosage, the decreased hydrolysis kinetics at more acidic media facilitated the sufficient growth and assembly of nanosheets, thus leads to larger HTSs constructed by nanosheets with higher density and wider side length.

Fig. 3a presents the XRD pattern of H1, H2 and H5. In the three samples, all the diffraction peaks are well assigned to anatase TiO2 (JCPDS No. 21-2172), the well-defined diffraction peaks evidence the high crystallinity of the samples. Compared with the standard diffraction diagram of anatase TiO2, the diffraction intensity of (200) facets of the three products are abnormally high, this phenomenon implies that the crystallographic growth of the primary nanosheets are predominantly along <100> directions, resulting in the exposure of (001) facets. The intensity ratio of (200) facets to (101) facets are 0.89, 0.92 and 1.19, respectively, which are much higher than the corresponding value of 0.35 in standard diffraction pattern. This tendency qualitatively indicates the high ratio of (001) facets in the three samples, furthermore, the exposure ratio of (001) facets increases gradually from H1 to H5.

The radially arrangement of primary nanosheets created porous structure of the HTSs. Fig. 3b demonstrates the N2 sorption isotherms and pore size distributions, and the main surface parameters are summarized in Table 1. From Fig. 3b, the isotherms of all the three samples exhibit type IV hysteresis loops at relative pressure of 0.4–1.0, indicating the mesoporous nature of the products, and the rapid increase in N2 adsorption amount at relative pressure of 1.0 for H1 and H2 illustrates the presence of wedgy pores with a wide orifice, which coincides with the SEM images (Fig. 1). The approximately H3-type hysteresis loop of the three products indicates the presence of slit-like mesopores. The BET surface areas of H1, H2 and H5 are estimated to be 204.7, 259.7 and 116.1 m2 g−1, respectively. BJH pore size distribution calculated from the desorption branches shows the existence of bimodal pores in H1 and H2, H1 demonstrates two peaks located around 3.5 and 51 nm, evidencing the coexistence of mesopores and macropores. The most probable pore sizes of H2 locate at around 3.7 and 23.8 nm, these pores are attributed to the outward arrangement of primary nanosheets. While for H5, the pore size is centered at 3.9 nm, which is due to the high density and the quasi-parallel arrangement of primary nanosheets.

In the fabrication of photoanodes, the HTSs were calcinated to remove the adsorbed F− anions. After calcinated at 450 °C for 2 h, the specific surface area of H1, H2 and H5 all decreased sharply to 42.7, 29.8 and 14.2 m2 g−1, respectively (Fig. S2 and Table S1, ESI†), though some studies showed the preservation of ultrathin (001) facets exposed sheets.26,35 The low BET surface area is caused by the collapse, fusion and the aggregation of the nanosheets, because the passivated F− can be effectively removed by calcination,22,23 the thermodynamically reactive (001) facets incline to shrink or aggregation, even collapsed at high temperature to reduce the overall surface free energy. Fig. 4 presents the SEM images of the calcinated products, it can be clearly observed that the morphologies of H1 and H5 changed drastically. H1 exhibits connected solid and hollow HTSs with diameter of 150–250 nm, as well as cracked fragments, almost no nanosheets could be observed, this indicates the thin nanosheets with low density in H1 were collapsed and aggregated again to form fused spheres after calcination. As for H5, the diameter remained unvaried as 2 μm, the flexible ultrathin nanosheets with high density were fused together to form solid spheres, resulting in some ditches on the surface. In contrast, the shape change of H2 is rather gentle, the primary nanosheets are maintained in the sphere, but nanosheets thickens and the diameter of the spheres decreases to ca. 300 nm, which is formed by slight collapse and shrink of nanosheets. The fuse of adjacent spheres by interlacing of primary sheets in calcinated H2 is beneficial for application in photoanode for the sheets offers direct transfer pathway for photoelectrons, alleviating the electrons recombination. Compared with the prototype samples, the dramatically decrease in diffraction of (200) facets indicates the lowered ratio of (001) facets after calcination (Fig. S3, ESI†).

Optical and photovoltaic response of photoanodes
The submicron or micron size of HTSs approach to the wavelength of visible light, so the calcinated samples possess enhanced scattering effect for visible light, which is rather useful for photovoltaic applications.36,37 Therefore, bilayered photoanodes were fabricated by coating ∼12 μm of NS as bottom layer and ∼8 μm of H1, H2 or H5 as scattering layer to compare the scattering abilities. From Fig. 5, the diffuse reflectance spectra of monolayered NS photoanode exhibited a peak at 400 nm and decreased gradually in the wavelength range of 400–700 nm, indicating the transparency of the film. Compared with NS photoanode, the diffuse reflectance of bilayered photoanodes enhanced dramatically, evidencing the incident light was significantly scattered by the bilayered photoanodes. Among the bilayered photoanodes, the decrease in reflectance of NS–H1 photoanode is steeper than the other two photoanodes (NS–H2 and NS–H5) with the increase of wavelength, this is mainly due to the existence of irregular fragments in H1 by calcination, reducing the overall reflectance at longer wavelength. The tendency of reflectance decrease for NS–H2 and NS–H5 with increase of wavelength are much slighter, suggesting the stronger scattering ability at longer wavelength, but the overall reflectance intensity of NS–H5 photoanode throughout the visible region is the lowest among the bilayered photoanodes, the possible reason lies in the much larger size (2 μm), the 8 μm scattering layer only allows the stacking of about 4 layers of H5, whereas the same thickness can accommodate over 26 layer of H2 (Scheme 1), the much less scattering centers and much shorter light travelling distance lead to the apparently lower scattering effect, so the lower reflectance of NS–H5 photoanode than the other two bilayered photoanodes is reasonable. Among the all photoanodes, NS–H2 demonstrated the highest scattering effect in visible region due to the scattering effect and multi-reflection of the primary nanosheets, which favors the strongest light harvesting ability for N719 dye, affording the highest photocurrent response and possibly the highest photovoltaic performance.

 Scheme 1  Schematic diagram of scattering effect of NS–H2 and NS–H5 photoanodes. 
The dye adsorption capacity of the photoanodes was estimated via measuring the absorbance of the dye solution eluted from the sensitized photoanodes. The dye adsorption capacities of the bilayered photoanodes with similar film thickness are slightly lower than the monolayered NS photoanode (Table 2), which maybe due to the low surface areas of the calcinated HTSs. The photocurrent responses of the DSSCs based on different photoanodes were compared via IPCE measurements. As shown in Fig. 6, the DSSCs based on bilayered photoanodes all demonstrated apparently higher IPCE peaks at 530 nm over the monolayered counterpart. Considering the lower dye loading capacities of bilayered photoanodes, it is supposed that the higher IPCE values are mainly attributed to the scattering effect of the hierarchical spheres, which substantially boosts up the light harvesting of N719 dye, affording a higher photocurrent response. Moreover, the bilayered photoanodes also demonstrated higher values at wavelength region of 650–720 nm, which further evidences the scattering effect, because the absorbance of dye in this region is low, the strong scattering effect increases the light utilization at this range and causes discernable photocurrent response. The normalized IPCE (inset) of bilayered photoanodes showed more apparent side peak than the monolayered one, which provides further evidence for the scattering effect. The order of IPCE values agrees with the diffusion reflectance of the photoanodes, which highlights the importance of scattering layers. The IPCE of NS–H2 photoanode is the highest in the visible region, implying the highest Jsc of DSSC.

To more comprehensively understand the effect of the HTSs scattering layer on the performance of DSSC, EIS was measured under open-circuit condition and AM 1.5 illumination to explore the electrons transfer and recombination behaviors during the photovoltaic process. As shown in Fig. 7a, Nyquist plots of all the cells demonstrated three peaks, the largest semicircle at intermediate frequency is attributed to the transfer of photoelectrons across TiO2 film or back reaction of photoelectrons to electrolyte,38,39 which is vital for the photovoltaic performance. The smaller semicircles of DSSCs based on the bilayered photoanodes than that of monolayered cell indicates the lower Rct at electrolyte–TiO2–dye interface, the Rct values of DSSCs based on NS–H1, NS–H2, NS–H5 and NS photoanodes are 7.45, 5.93, 9.38 and 11.97 Ω, respectively according to the equivalent circuit shown in inset. The lowest Rct of cell based on NS–H2 photoanode favors the fastest redox kinetics of I3−/I− pairs at photoanode–dye–electrolyte interface, the rapid electron transfer from electrolyte to oxidized dye favors the most efficient injection of electrons to TiO2 and transfer across the film to outer circuit, reducing the rate of electron recombination. The preservation of two dimensional nanosheets in H2 is proposed to be the main reason for the lowest resistance, the sheet-like primary units with high crystallinity in H2 provide the shortest charge transferring pathway for the photoelectrons, facilitating the fastest transfer of photoelectrons with a low chance of recombination. Additionally, the slit-like wide pores also benefit the infiltration of electrolyte, the enhanced electrode–dye–electrolyte interface redox activity accelerates the regeneration of the oxidized dyes and a more efficient electron injection to TiO2. Both of the positive factors finally result in a higher photovoltaic performance. Bode mode of EIS was shown in Fig. 7b, which can offer information on the electron recombination lifetimes (τe) of the photo-injected electrons during the photovoltaic process. τe can be calculated from the maximum frequency (fmax) of the peak at intermediate frequency as: τe = 1/2πfmax.40,41fmax of the peaks at intermediate frequency region for the cells based on NS–H1, NS–H2, NS–H5 and NS photoanodes with similar thickness are 4.65, 3.84, 10.01 and 26.12 Hz, respectively, and the τe of them are calculated to be 34.2, 41.4, 15.9, and 6.1 ms accordingly. The much longer τe in the cells based on bilayered photoanode suggests the effective inhibition of electron recombination during the electrons transfer across photoanode films. The lower electron loss results in higher photoelectrons collection efficiency at FTO substrate and higher Jsc of the cells. The longest τe in DSSC based on NS–H2 photoanode can also be attributed to the structure of H2, the sheet-like primary unit and the tightly interlacement between adjacent spheres offers the most efficient electron transfer pathway, which leads to the photoelectrical conversion with the least electrons loss, resulting in higher Jsc.

Photovoltaic measurements
The photovoltaic performance of the DSSCs based on NS, NS–H1, NS–H2 and NS–H5 photoanodes were characterized by I–V measurements under AM 1.5 illumination (Fig. 8), and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters were summarized in Table 2. The monolayered NS photoanode offered a Jsc of 12.97 mA cm−2, open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.71 V, and η of 5.39%. The Jsc of bilayered photoanodes increased drastically, and the η of these cells ranges from 6.91 to 7.72%, although the dye adsorption capacity are relatively lower. Among these cells, NS–H2 cell demonstrated the highest Jsc of 18.1 mA cm−2 and η of 7.72%, 42% improvement over the monolayered NS cell. Because the dye adsorption capacity is lower than cell NS–H1, the high PCE of cell NS–H2 is mainly attributed to the higher scattering effect and more efficient charge transfer at TiO2–dye–electrolyte interface due to the sheet-like primary unit in H2, which predominates over the negative influence of lower dye adsorption capacity to η, contributing to the highest photovoltaic performance.

Conclusions
In summary, HTSs with a high ratio of (001) facets were synthesized by a facile solvothermal reaction under the control of HF and HAc. The as-prepared products exhibited powerful scattering effect due to the suitable diameter, when used as scattering layers, the HTSs can dramatically enhance the photovoltaic performance of DSSCs. Due to the excellent scattering effect and the low Rct of H2, the DSSC based on photoanode with H2 as the scattering layer offers the highest photovoltaic performance.
