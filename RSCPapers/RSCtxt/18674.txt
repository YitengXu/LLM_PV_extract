    , Accepted 7th April 2020First published on 7th April 2020AbstractIn this work, the biomolecule-assisted microwave heating synthesis of ZnIn2S4, along with the ZnIn2S4/MoS2 composites and their photocatalytic applications, were studied. Well-defined flower-like ZnIn2S4 microspheres synthesized at microwave heating time of 1 h provided the highest surface area and total pore volume, which offered the highest H2 production rate (111.6 μmol h−1 g−1). Different amounts of MoS2 were loaded into the ZnIn2S4 microspheres to form ZnIn2S4/MoS2 composites aiming to improve the H2 production rate. Among the fabricated ZnIn2S4/MoS2 composites, the ZnIn2S4/MoS2-40% wt composite exhibited the highest H2 production rate (200.1 μmol h−1 g−1) under UV-visible light irradiation. In addition, for the first time, this composite was applied for the photoreduction reaction of Cr(VI) ion under visible light irradiation. It provided higher photoreduction efficiency than the single components, where the efficiency was improved in the acidic solutions over the levels recorded in the basic solution. The charge transfer pathway and photocatalytic mechanisms of the ZnIn2S4/MoS2-40% wt photocatalyst have been proposed based on the results obtained from UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, photoluminescence spectroscopy, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, Mott–Schottky measurements and the silver photo-deposition experiment.
1. Introduction
Photocatalytic production of H2 gas from water splitting reactions and the reduction of heavy metal ions in the wastewater using solar energy in the presence of photocatalysts are effective strategies for resolving certain energy and environmental problems.1 Semiconductor materials have attracted interest for use as photocatalysts for these photocatalytic reactions. TiO2 is known as the most efficient photocatalyst among various metal oxide semiconductors because of its high chemical stability, relatively low cost and non-toxic properties.2 However, the practical applications of TiO2 are limited by its poor visible light absorption capacity.3 In pursuit of efficient utilization of solar energy, the exploration of highly active photocatalysts with visible light response is of great interest in current research studies. ZnIn2S4, the only member of AB2X4 family semiconductors with a layered structure, has attracted considerable attention as a promising visible-light-driven photocatalyst for the photocatalytic reactions of H2 evolution and Cr(VI) reduction due to its narrow band gap (Eg = 2.43–2.70 eV) and good chemical stability.4–6 However, it usually suffers from a high recombination rate of photo-generated charge carriers, which limits its photocatalytic efficiency.7 There are several approaches that have been employed to improve the efficiency of ZnIn2S4, for example, the fabrication of ZnIn2S4 with controllable morphology,8,9 doping metal ions into the ZnIn2S4 crystals10,11 and by coupling Znln2S4 with carbon12,13 or fluoropolymer.14 However, morphologically controlled strategies are practically difficult due to their complex formation mechanism, and the fact that the correlation between morphologies and the corresponding photocatalytic properties still remains unclear. High concentrations of transition metal ions lead to defects in the crystal lattice of ZnIn2S4.11 Despite the recognition that coupling ZnIn2S4 with carbon or fluoropolymer can enhance photocatalytic oxidation activity13 and H2 evolution,14 and the fact that the photocorrosion of these composite photocatalysts can be prevented,14 the electron–hole pair recombination process presents a major problem in terms of the decrease in the photocatalytic performance that still occur during the photocatalytic process.
Fabrication of a semiconductor heterostructure is a promising approach to inhibiting the electron–hole pair recombination process and to improving the efficiency of the photo-generated charge separation process.15 Previously published literature has revealed that the ZnIn2S4/K2La2Ti3O10 photocatalyst exhibited higher photocatalytic activity for H2 evolution when compared with ZnIn2S4.16 However, K2La2Ti3O10 is a wide-band-gap semiconductor (Eg = 3.05–3.50 eV), which actives under the UV light region. Compared with metal oxide semiconductors, metal sulfides usually have narrower band gaps because they possess relatively high conduction band positions. These are consequently derived from the higher valence band position constructed by S 3p orbitals.17 This entity enables them to absorb solar energy in the visible region. MoS2 is a layer-structured transition metal dichalcogenide that has attracted attention as a photocatalyst for its role in the solar-driven H2 evolution reaction and its role in hydrodesulfurization and hydrogenation due to its low cost, high chemical stability and excellent visible light response (Eg = 1.80 eV).18–20 Moreover, the conduction band position of MoS2 was less negative than the hexagonal ZnIn2S4 material.21 Therefore, the possibility for a directional transfer of the photo-generated electrons from ZnIn2S4 to MoS2 is feasible. Consequently, the photo-generated holes would move in the opposite direction. As a result of these actions, the photo-generated charge recombination process could effectively be inhibited. In addition, a typical layered structure of MoS2 assists a good interfacial contact on the ZnIn2S4 surface, which is one of the important factors facilitating the promotion of the photo-generated electrons and holes to transfer across the contact interface between ZnIn2S4 and MoS2 in the ZnIn2S4/MoS2 heterostructure. This then leads to an increase in the photocatalytic H2 evolution activity as has been previously reported in published literatures.7,21–25
The microwave heating method is a low-energy synthesis method requiring rapid heating. It has strong potential to synthesize semiconductor materials with a high degree of crystallinity and purity. In a comparison with conventional heating methods, the microwave heating method involves a conversion from electromagnetic energy to thermal energy rather than a transfer of heat. It requires the microwave absorption ability of conductive substances and solvent in the reaction solution. During microwave irradiation, microwave energy interacts directly with these substances through a molecular interaction with the electromagnetic field, resulting in a degree of volumetric heating that allows rapid and more uniform heating.26 Consequently, the highly crystalline materials with uniformed shape and narrow size distribution can be obtained at a relatively low temperature and over a short period of time.27 This leads to a significant reduction in energy consumption in terms of material production. Moreover, by utilizing microwave radiation, semiconductor-based composite materials, with a strong interaction of two single-materials, can be successfully achieved.28
Recently, biomolecule-assisted synthesis has become an environmentally friendly route for preparing various metal sulfide semiconductors.29,30 Herein, L-cysteine, an inexpensive and simple amino acid, has been chosen as a sulfur source because the characteristic functional groups in its molecular structure, including the simple hydrosulfide group (–SH) and the multifunctional groups (–NH2 and –COO−), can coordinate with metal ions to form metal–L-cysteine complexes. Subsequently, sulfur ion (S2−) is released.31–33 Thus, the formation of toxic H2S gas as a result of the employment of a familiar sulfur source (thioacetamide, thiourea, sodium thiosulfate and Na2S) can be prevented.34
In this work, the biomolecule-assisted microwave heating method using L-cysteine as a sulfur source was applied for the fabrication of ZnIn2S4 and ZnIn2S4/MoS2 materials. First, the microwave heating time was verified in order to investigate the characteristics and photocatalytic H2 production of ZnIn2S4 under UV-visible light irradiation. Additionally, different weight percentages of MoS2 were then loaded into ZnIn2S4 to form ZnIn2S4/MoS2 composites with the goal of enhancing the H2 production rate. Moreover, the ZnIn2S4/MoS2 composite with an optimum weight percentage of MoS2 was applied for a reduction reaction of a toxic Cr(VI) ion to a less toxic Cr(III) ion under visible light irradiation, in parallel with ZnIn2S4, MoS2, and physical mixture of ZnIn2S4 and MoS2. In addition, the photocatalytic stability of the ZnIn2S4/MoS2 photocatalyst under the same reaction conditions was investigated. Possible photocatalytic mechanisms for the enhancement of H2 production and Cr(VI) reduction reactions over the ZnIn2S4/MoS2 composite have also been discussed.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Photocatalysts preparation
For the synthesis of ZnIn2S4, ZnCl2 (2.0 mmol; Sigma-Aldrich, 99.99%), InCl3·4H2O (4.0 mmol; Sigma-Aldrich, 97.0%) and L-cysteine (10.0 mmol; Sigma-Aldrich, 97.0%) were dissolved in de-ionized water (20.0 mL). After constant stirring for 20 min, the solution was transferred into a dissolution vessel with a capacity of 50.0 mL. The vessel was sealed and exposed to microwave radiation at 100 W in a microwave synthesis reactor (Discover SP Installation, model PN600635) and then naturally cooled to room temperature. The microwave heating time was varied from 1 to 3 h. Finally, a dark green-yellow powder was collected by vacuum filtration, washed several times with de-ionized water and dried (80 °C for 24 h).
For the synthesis of MoS2, Na2MoO4·2H2O (2.0 mmol; Merck, 99.5%) and L-cysteine (4.0 mmol; Sigma-Aldrich, 97.0%) were dissolved in de-ionized water (50.0 mL). After constant stirring for 20 min, the solution was transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave with a capacity of 125.0 mL. The autoclave was sealed and heated (200 °C for 24 h) and then naturally cooled to room temperature. Finally, a black powder was separated from the mother liquor by vacuum filtration, washed several times with de-ionized water and dried (80 °C for 24 h).
To synthesize ZnIn2S4/MoS2 composites, the as-prepared ZnIn2S4 and MoS2 powders were dispersed in de-ionized water (20.0 mL) under constant stirring. The suspension was then transferred into a dissolution vessel with a capacity of 50.0 mL. The vessel was sealed and exposed to microwave radiation in the microwave synthesis reactor operated at 100 W for 1 h and then naturally cooled to room temperature. Finally, the resulting powder was collected by centrifugation and then dried (80 °C for 24 h). The ZnIn2S4/MoS2 composites with different loading amounts of MoS2 were denoted as ZIS/MS-x%, where x represents the weight percentage of MoS2 (20, 30, 40, 50, 60 and 80). A physical mixture of ZnIn2S4 and 40% wt of MoS2, denoted as mixed-40%, was also prepared by physical grinding without microwave treatment for the purposes of comparison.
2.2. Photocatalyst characterization techniques
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained using a RIGAKU Smartlab X-ray diffractometer with CuKα radiation. UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV-visible DRS, Agilent Technologies, Cary Series) was used to record the UV-visible DRS spectra in a wavelength range of 200–800 nm with a scan rate of 150 nm min−1. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller N2 gas adsorption method (BET, Quantachrome, Quadrasorb-evo) was used to determine the specific surface area and pore volume of the solid samples, where water adsorbed on the surface of samples was removed at 120 °C for 3 h under a vacuum before analysis. Particle size and morphology were analyzed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM, TESCAN MAIA3 and JEOL JSM-6335 F). The microstructure was analyzed with a transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEOL, JEM-2010). Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) was used in conjunction with SEM and with TEM to analyte elemental compositions of the sample. To determine the oxidation states of the elements on the surface of the samples, the X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS, Kratos Axis Ultra DLD) were recorded using AlKα irradiation at 120 W and analyzer pass energies of 160 eV. The photoluminescence spectra (PL, Avantes AvaSpec-2048TEC-USB2) were recorded with an excitation wavelength of 590 nm at room temperature. Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) decay spectra were recorded on a DeltaFlex lifetime spectrofluorometer.
Electrochemical measurements (Autolab potentiostat/galvanostat, PGSTAT128N, Metrohm Siam Ltd.) were performed using a three-electrode cell and Na2SO4 aqueous solution (0.1 M), which served as an electrolyte solution. To fabricate a working electrode, the photocatalyst (0.1 g) was dispersed in 10.0 mL of a solution of isopropanol and DI water (40:20% v/v) under magnetic stirring. Subsequently, the dispersion solution was dropped on the fixed area (1 × 1 cm2) of a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glass substrate. After overnight evaporation (60 °C), a working electrode was obtained. Platinum (Pt) and Ag/AgCl were used as counter and reference electrodes, respectively. The electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were recorded by imposing a voltage of 1.5 V within a frequency range from 0.1 Hz–100 kHz. Linear sweep voltammograms were performed under visible light irradiation for 180 s, operating at 200 mV s−1 in a range from −0.4 V to +1.3 V (vs. Ag/AgCl). The transient photocurrent response was measured in a light on–off process with a pulse of 30 s and bias potential of 1.0 V. The Mott–Schottky plots were performed at a range of −1.5 V to +1.5 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) with an applied frequency of 100 Hz and an AC amplitude of 10 mV. To convert the measured potential vs. Ag/AgCl to the NHE scale, the following equation was applied; ENHE = EAg/AgCl + , where  (3.0 M KCl) = 0.21 V at 25 °C.
2.3. Experimental setup for photocatalytic reaction tests
Photocatalytic measurement for the H2 production reaction was performed in a closed Pyrex flask reactor (150 mL). The photocatalyst (0.1 g) was dispersed in 100.0 mL of a mixed aqueous solution containing Na2S (0.35 M) and Na2SO3 (0.25 M) as a sacrificial reagent. The volume ratio of the Na2S/Na2SO3 sacrificial reagent and de-ionized water was 60:40 v/v. Prior to irradiation, the suspension was purged with argon gas for 30 min to remove the dissolved gases in the de-ionized water. The photocatalytic reaction was carried out for 3 h by irradiating the suspension with a xenon lamp (150 W, Oriel model 6256, Newport) that was positioned 10.0 cm from the reactor. The spectral irradiance of the xenon lamp is shown in Fig. S1.† During light irradiation, continuous magnetic stirring was applied to sustain the photocatalyst in the suspension. The evolved H2 amount was monitored with a gas chromatograph (PerkinElmer, Clarus 480) equipped with a packed 13× molecular sieve column and a thermal conductivity detector (with argon gas as the carrier gas).
For the photocatalytic Cr(VI) reduction test, an LED white light (50 W YNL model COB) was used as a visible light source that was located 8.0 cm from the reactor.28 The spectral irradiance of the LED lamp is shown in Fig. S2.† The photocatalyst (0.1 g) was dispersed in a K2Cr2O7 aqueous solution (10 ppm, 200.0 mL). The pH value of the solution was adjusted using 1 M HCl or 1 M NH4OH solutions. Before light irradiation, the suspension was magnetically stirred in the dark for 30 min to reach adsorption–desorption equilibrium. During light irradiation, the suspension (5 mL) was sampled every 30 min. Finally, the Cr(VI) content in the sampling was measured colorimetrically using the standard diphenylcarbazide method.35 In this method, Cr(VI) ion reacts with 1,5-diphenylcarbazide under acidic condition28 resulting in the formation of a reddish-purple-colored complex of a Cr(VI)–diphenylcarbazide complex. This process can be monitored using UV-visible spectroscopy at λmax of 532 nm. The photoreduction efficiency was calculated using the following equation;  where C0 and C were the concentrations of the Cr(VI) complex at adsorption–desorption equilibrium and after light irradiation, respectively. A blank experiment (without adding any photocatalyst) was also carried out under the same conditions for the purposes of comparison.
Apparent quantum yield (AQY) of ZnIn2S4 and ZnIn2S4/MoS2-40% wt photocatalysts for the H2 production and Cr(VI) production reactions were also calculated. The calculation methods are presented in the ESI.† The photocatalyst powders after the photocatalytic reaction tests were carefully recovered by centrifugation and by washing them several times with de-ionized water. After being dried at 60 °C, the recovered photocatalysts were reused to assess further photocatalytic reactions under the same experimental conditions.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Effect of microwave heating time on the characteristics and photocatalytic H2 production rate of ZnIn2S4
XRD patterns of the powders synthesized at different microwave heating times are shown in Fig. S3.† The main diffraction peaks located at 2θ of 21.2°, 27.9°, 30.1°, 39.9°, 47.3°, 51.8° and 55.5° correspond to the (006), (102), (104), (108), (110), (116) and (202) crystal planes of the hexagonal ZnIn2S4 phase (JCPDS no. 01-072-0773). No other diffraction peaks of any possible impurities, such as binary metal sulfide and metal oxide related to the precursors, are observed.36 The strong and sharp diffraction peaks indicate that the synthesized ZnIn2S4 powders are well-crystalline.37 With prolonged microwave heating times, the (104) crystal plane is strengthened suggesting an increase in the degree of crystallinity of ZnIn2S4. The crystallite size of the ZnIn2S4 particles was calculated from the (110) diffraction peak by applying the Debye–Scherrer equation; D = 0.9λ/βcosθ, where D is the crystallite size in nanometer, λ is the wavelength of CuKα, β is the full width at half-maximum (FWHM) in radian and θ is the half-diffraction angle in degrees.38 The calculated crystallite size of the ZnIn2S4 particles synthesized at 1 h, 2 h and 3 h are 19.6, 48.0 and 86.3 nm, respectively. These results imply that microwave heating time affects the crystallinity and crystallite size of ZnIn2S4 synthesized under the present synthesis conditions.
UV-visible DRS spectra of all ZnIn2S4 powders (Fig. 1a) show the absorption edges at 440 nm, 470 nm and 480 nm, respectively. According to the equation Eg = 1240/λ, where the Eg and λ represent the band gap energy and absorption edge of semiconductors, the band gap energy values of ZnIn2S4 are 2.81, 2.64 and 2.58 eV for the ZnIn2S4 powders synthesized at 1 h, 2 h and 3 h, respectively. These findings imply that all synthesized ZnIn2S4 powders are visible-light active materials. Fig. 1b–d presents the high-resolution XPS spectra of Zn 2p, In 3d and S 2p of the ZnIn2S4 samples. The XPS spectra of Zn 2p (Fig. 1b) reveal two peaks of Zn 2p3/2 and Zn 2p1/2 centered at 1022.08 eV and 1048.08 eV, respectively. The XPS spectra of In 3d (Fig. 1c) show two peaks centered at 445.08 eV and 452.20 eV which are indexed as the binding energy values of In 3d5/2 and In 3d3/2, respectively. The XPS spectra of S 2p (Fig. 1d) can be convoluted into two peaks; one is located at 161.83 eV (S 2p1/2) and the other is at 162.93 eV (S 2p3/2). The binding energy values correspond to the oxidation states of Zn2+, In3+ and S2−, respectively.39 The gradually decrease in the XPS intensity with prolonging microwave reaction time could be attributed to the decrease in the atomic concentration of metals at the surface of ZnIn2S4 as presented in Fig. S4† and the diffusion of metal atoms towards the bulk.40,41

SEM images of all ZnIn2S4 powders (Fig. 2) reveal that the powder synthesized at 1 h (Fig. 2a) is composed of flower-like microspheres with an average diameter of 2 μm. These microspheres are constructed of several interconnected nanosheets with an average thickness of 50 nm, creating multi-cavities on their surface. With longer heating times applied, flower-like ZnIn2S4 microspheres still obtained but the diameter size is increased, and an aggregation behavior is observed (Fig. 2a–c). The average diameters of such microspheres are 4 and 6 μm for ZnIn2S4 synthesized at 2 and 3 h, respectively. In addition, the merging of the adjacent nanosheets is observed leading to a decrease in the number of the cavities on the surface of the microspheres. These phenomena probably occur as a result of the behavior of the particles and their tendency to reduce excess energy at the surface, which is activated by microwave radiation during the prolonged irradiation. The BET surface areas of the ZnIn2S4 microspheres synthesized at 1 h, 2 h and 3 h are 48, 42 and 39 m2 g−1, respectively. The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms of these samples are provided in Fig. S5a.† Additionally, total pore volumes of ZnIn2S4 synthesized at 1 h, 2 h and 3 h are 0.2877, 0.2609 and 0.1868 cm3 g−1, respectively. The BET surface area and total pore volumes decrease along with an increase in the microwave heating time, which are consistent with the decrease in the number of cavities on the surface of ZnIn2S4 microspheres as can be observed in the SEM images (Fig. 2d–f).

The photocatalytic H2 production rates of all ZnIn2S4 powders were investigated under UV-visible light irradiation. The amounts of produced H2 gas were plotted as a function of time (Fig. 2g). The ZnIn2S4 photocatalysts synthesized at 1, 2 and 3 h can produce H2 gas at the rates of 111.6, 50.6 and 36.2 μmol h−1 g−1, respectively. The ZnIn2S4 photocatalyst synthesized at 1 h provides the highest rate of H2 production. Consequently, it is suggested that the greater the surface area and total pore volume of the photocatalyst not only provide more available active sites for the adsorption of substrates on the surface of the photocatalyst, but also increase surface charge carriers that are transferred during the H2 production process.42 Additionally, the large number of cavities on the surface of the ZnIn2S4 photocatalyst could promote multiple reflections and the scattering of the incident light on their surface, resulting in an improvement in light harvesting efficiency and an increase in the life-time of the photo-generated charge carriers that take part in the photocatalytic reactions.43,44 In addition, the larger band gap energy of the ZnIn2S4 photocatalyst that was synthesized at 1 h could hinder the rate of electron–hole pair recombination in the ZnIn2S4 structure.45 Furthermore, the atomic concentration of the metals at the surface of ZnIn2S4 could be one of the factors affecting to its photocatalytic activity. Based on these results, the ZnIn2S4 powder that was synthesized at 1 h was chosen to be combined with different loading amounts of MoS2 to form the ZnIn2S4/MoS2 composites in an attempt to improve its overall photocatalytic activity.
3.2. Photocatalytic activity of ZnIn2S4/MoS2 composites

3.2.1. Characterizations of some synthesized samples. 
The XRD spectrum of the ZnIn2S4/MoS2-40% wt composite shown in Fig. 3a exhibits the diffraction peaks of the hexagonal ZnIn2S4 structure with additional diffraction peaks located at 2θ of 14.4° and 33.5°, which can be indexed as the (002) and (101) crystal planes of the hexagonal MoS2 structure (JCPDS no. 01-075-1539), respectively. This result suggests the successful fabrication of the ZnIn2S4/MoS2 composite via the microwave heating method. The spectrum of the composite is not changed in terms of the peak positions and shapes when compared with those of ZnIn2S4, indicating that the existence of MoS2 does not affect the crystal structure of ZnIn2S4. The peak intensity of ZnIn2S4 in the ZnIn2S4/MoS2-40% wt composite decreases after being combined with MoS2. This result implies that the ZnIn2S4 particles can be deposited by the MoS2 particles, which can then be further confirmed by SEM and TEM analyses. UV-visible DRS spectrum of the ZnIn2S4/MoS2-40% wt composite in comparison with ZnIn2S4 and MoS2 is shown in Fig. 3b. MoS2 has an absorption edge at 630 nm corresponding to a band gap energy of 1.96 eV (inset of Fig. 3b). After introducing MoS2 to ZnIn2S4, the absorption edge of ZnIn2S4/MoS2-40% wt shifts to longer wavelength region when compared with that of ZnIn2S4, and the absorption ability of the composite in the visible light region is enhanced. These results imply that the ZnIn2S4/MoS2 composite can utilize more visible light to generate more electrons and holes. Consequently, the enhancement of the visible-light absorption ability of this composite could be attributed to the interaction between ZnIn2S4 and MoS2, which can then be further confirmed by XPS analysis.

The high-resolution XPS spectra of Zn 2p, In 3d, S 2p and Mo 3d for the ZnIn2S4/MoS2-40% wt composite in comparison with those of the ZnIn2S4 and MoS2 are displayed in Fig. 4. The XPS signals for Zn 2p of the composite (Fig. 4a) reveal that the peaks at 1022.18 and 1048.23 eV correspond to Zn 2p3/2 and Zn 2p1/2, respectively, suggesting the +2 oxidation state of Zn. The signals of In 3d (Fig. 4b) at binding energy values of 445.38 and 452.58 eV correspond to In 3d5/2 and In 3d3/2, respectively, indicating the presence of In3+. The spectrum of S 2p (Fig. 4c) shows that the peaks at 161.98 and 162.98 eV are attributed to S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2, confirming the −2 oxidation state of S. In Fig. 4d, the peaks at binding energy values of 228.78 eV and 232.13 eV are assigned to Mo 3d5/2 and Mo 3d3/2, respectively, which correspond to the +4 oxidation state of Mo.46 Additionally, the peak at 226.28 eV corresponds to the S 2s transition. The XPS result confirms that the prepared ZnIn2S4/MoS2 is indeed a composite of ZnIn2S4 and MoS2. It is also found that these binding energy values shift in comparison to ZnIn2S4 and MoS2, indicating the changes in the chemical environments of Zn2+, In2+ ions in ZnIn2S4 structure and Mo4+ ion in MoS2 structure. This finding implies a chemical interaction between ZnIn2S4 and MoS2 at the interfacial of the ZnIn2S4/MoS2 heterostructure after the microwave treatment rather than a physical interaction.

The SEM images of ZnIn2S4, MoS2 and ZnIn2S4/MoS2-40% wt are shown in Fig. 5. The morphology of MoS2 (Fig. 5b) seems to be a cluster-like structure with an average diameter size of 350 nm. This structure is constructed of highly aggregated ultrathin nanosheets (inset of Fig. 5b). It is also found that the MoS2 nanosheets are curved, which is similar to the previously reported features of MoS2.47 This phenomena could be attributed to the fact that ultrathin nanosheets are unstable and closed structures can easily be formed by rolling up to eliminate dangling bonds at the edges and to minimize their surface energy.48,49 The SEM (Fig. 5c and d) and TEM (Fig. 5e and f) images of the composite reveal that the MoS2 particles cover the surface of the ZnIn2S4 nanosheets and are also deposited on the interior surface of the cavities. The BET surface areas of the ZnInS2, ZnIn2S4/MoS2-40% wt and MoS2 are 48, 40 and 8 m2 g−1 with the total pore volumes of 0.2877, 0.1798 and 0.032 cm3 g−1, respectively. The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm of ZnIn2S4/MoS2-40% wt in comparison with ZnIn2S4 is provided in Fig. S5b.† The high-magnified TEM image of the composite (Fig. 5g and h) reveals lattice fringes of 0.42 nm and 0.22 nm, which can be indexed as (006) plane of ZnIn2S4 and (103) plane of MoS2, respectively. This finding implies the highly crystalline nature of the composite material and confirms that the ZnIn2S4/MoS2 heterojunction is formed through the close contact between the ZnIn2S4 and MoS2 particles. The EDX spectrum of the ZnIn2S4/MoS2-40% wt composite (Fig. 6a) reveals the characteristic signals of the Zn, In, S and Mo elements, further confirming the existence of both ZnIn2S4 and MoS2 in the ZnIn2S4/MoS2-40% wt composite. Notably, the signals of the C and O elements are found to have come from the environment. Scanning TEM-EDX elemental mapping (Fig. 6b–f) reveals that the Zn, In, S and Mo elements are homogenously distributed throughout the composite material. This suggests that the porous structure of ZnIn2S4 facilitates the formation of the interfacial heterostructure between ZnIn2S4 and MoS2 after being exposed to microwave radiation.50 Based on the chemical compositions obtained from the EDX analysis, the actual weight percentage of MoS2 in the ZnIn2S4/MoS2-40% wt composite was calculated to be 39.45%, which is close to the preparation content.

The EIS Nyquist plots can be used to determine the charge transfer resistance and the separation efficiency of photo-generated electron–hole pairs in the materials. In general, a smaller diameter of the Nyquist plot reflects a lower degree of charge transfer resistance at the electrode–electrolyte interface, which corresponds to a greater degree of charge separation efficiency.51Fig. 7a shows the EIS Nyquist plots of the ZnIn2S4/MoS2 composites in comparison with pure ZnIn2S4. The ZnIn2S4/MoS2-40% wt electrode shows the smallest diameter on the EIS Nyquist plot, indicating the lowest level of charge transfer resistance. This implies a significant level of efficiency of the charge separation and interfacial charge transportation between ZnIn2S4 and MoS2 in the ZnIn2S4/MoS2-40% wt heterostructure. In addition, the EIS Nyquist plot of the ZnIn2S4/MoS2 physical mixture (mixed-40%) is larger than that of ZnIn2S4 and ZnIn2S4/MoS2-40% wt, suggesting a poor interfacial interaction between ZnIn2S4 and MoS2 in the ZnIn2S4/MoS2 physical mixture. This finding suggests that the stronger interfacial interaction between ZnIn2S4 and MoS2 results in better electrons–holes separation efficiency, which is essential for improving photocatalytic performance. Furthermore, linear sweep voltammograms (Fig. 7b) shows that photocurrent density of the ZnIn2S4/MoS2-40% wt photoelectrode is enhanced compared with the ZnIn2S4 photoelectrode in the entire scanning region, supporting that the charge carriers generation and separation of ZnIn2S4/MoS2-40% wt are more efficient than those of ZnIn2S4. The transient photocurrent density-time curve of the ZnIn2S4/MoS2-40% wt photoelectrode (Fig. S6†) shows reproducible response with the photocurrent density of about 0.37 mA cm−2.

The suppression of the charge recombination process in the ZnIn2S4/MoS2-40% wt heterojunction is supported by photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL). Typically, a lower emission intensity of the PL spectrum means a lower recombination rate of photo-generated electron–hole pairs.52Fig. 7c demonstrates the PL spectra of the composite samples under an excitation wavelength of 590 nm. All the samples exhibit similar PL spectra centering at about 670 nm. The PL emission spectrum of the ZnIn2S4/MoS2-40% wt composite is lower in intensity in comparison with ZnIn2S4 and the other composites, implying a lower charge recombination rate as mentioned above. Besides, the lifetime (τ) of the photo-generated charge carriers of the composite was investigated by TRPL in comparison with ZnIn2S4. The TRPL decay spectra are shown in Fig. 7d. The spectra were fitted to a bi-exponential function.53,54 The fitting parameter and the parameters used for the calculation of the average exciton lifetime are listed in Table S1.† The average lifetime for ZnIn2S4/MoS2-40% wt (17.81 ns) is longer than that for ZnIn2S4 (13.77 ns), which is attributed to the more rapid transfer of photo-generated electrons and holes through the interfacial contact in the ZnIn2S4/MoS2 heterojunction. Consequently, the recombination of electron–hole pairs is hindered and the number of photo-generated electrons to participate in the reduction reactions is increased.55,56 The EIS, PL and TRPL results specify that the formation of the ZnIn2S4/MoS2 heterojunction with an appropriate loading amount of MoS2 can increase the charge separation and transportation efficiencies, and reduce the recombination rate of photogenerated electrons and holes.
The energy band positions of ZnIn2S4 and MoS2 were calculated according to the Mulliken electronegativity theory by using the following equations: ECB = X − Ee − 0.5Eg and EVB = ECB + Eg, where EVB and ECB represent the valence and conduction band potentials, respectively.57,58 Additionally, X is the absolute electronegativity of the semiconductor materials (4.82 eV for ZnIn2S4 (ref. 57) and 5.36 eV for MoS2 (ref. 59)), Ee is the estimated energy of the free electrons on the hydrogen scale (about 4.5 eV) and Eg is the band gap energy of the semiconductor materials. According to the calculated Eg values (2.81 eV for ZnIn2S4 and 1.96 eV for MoS2) obtained from the UV-visible DRS analysis, the EVB and ECB values of ZnIn2S4 are 1.71 eV and −1.10 eV, respectively, while the EVB and ECB values of MoS2 are 1.84 eV and −0.12 eV, respectively.60 The EVB and ECB of ZnIn2S4 and MoS2 were also calculated from the Mott–Schottky measurements. As is shown in Fig. 7e and f, the positive slope of the linear plots for the ZnIn2S4 and MoS2 electrodes indicates that ZnIn2S4 and MoS2 are n-type semiconductors. By extrapolating the linear portion of the Mott–Schottky plots to 1/C2 = 0, the flat band potentials (EF) of the ZnIn2S4 and MoS2 electrodes are −1.11 and −0.18 V (vs. Ag/AgCl), which can be converted to −0.90 and 0.03 V (vs. NHE), respectively. Typically, ECB of an n-type semiconductor is ∼0.1 V more negative than its flat band potential. Therefore, ECB of ZnIn2S4 and MoS2 are −1.00 and −0.07 V (vs. NHE), respectively. Combining with their Eg values, EVB of ZnIn2S4 and MoS2 are calculated as 1.81 and 1.89 V, respectively. As is summarized in Table S2,†EVB and ECB of ZnIn2S4 and MoS2 calculated from the Mott–Schottky measurements are close to the values obtained from the theoretical calculation.


3.2.2. Photocatalytic H2 production activity. 
Photocatalytic H2 production activity of the ZnIn2S4/MoS2 composites under UV-visible light irradiation were investigated. As is shown in Fig. 8a, ZnIn2S4 and MoS2 photocatalysts can produce H2 gas at the production rates of 111.6 and 13.3 μmol h−1 g−1, respectively. After ZnIn2S4 is introduced by 20, 30 and 40% wt of MoS2, these ZnIn2S4/MoS2 composites can produce H2 gas at higher rates at up to 153.3, 163.3 and 200.1 μmol h−1 g−1, respectively. The improved activity of these ZnIn2S4/MoS2 composites is originated by enhanced charge separation efficiency and transportation, as well as by charge recombination suppression at the contact interface between ZnIn2S4 and MoS2 in the ZnIn2S4/MoS2 heterojunction. However, the ZnIn2S4/MoS2 composites with higher amounts of MoS2 (50, 60 and 80% wt) decrease the H2 production rate to 126.6, 96.6 and 66.6 μmol h−1 g−1, respectively. This is probably because the excess MoS2 particles with less activity could mask the active sites of the ZnIn2S4 surface and could also reduce the light absorption capability of the composites. As a result, the quantity of photogenerated charges and active species involved in the photocatalytic reactions are decreased. Therefore, a suitable amount of MoS2 in the ZnIn2S4/MoS2 composite is necessary for optimizing photocatalytic activity due to the significant synergistic effect between the two single-components for the photocatalytic reactions. Among the other photocatalysts, the ZnIn2S4/MoS2 composite with 40% wt of MoS2 is the most efficient photocatalyst proving a greatly enhanced level of efficacy, where the rate of H2 reduction by this composite photocatalyst is approximately 1.8 and 15.1 times faster than that of ZnIn2S4 and MoS2, respectively. The AQY value of ZnIn2S4/MoS2-40% wt (0.19%) for H2 reduction reaction is also higher when compared with ZnIn2S4 (0.10%). Furthermore, this composite shows remarkably higher activity (200.1 μmol h−1 g−1) than the physical mixture of ZnIn2S4 and 40% wt of MoS2 (60.3 μmol h−1 g−1), highlighting a determination that the strong chemical interaction between two single-components in the ZnIn2S4/MoS2 heterojunction is necessary for the improvement of photocatalytic activity. The photocatalytic activity of ZnIn2S4/MoS2-40% wt for the H2 production reaction was also tested under UV-visible and visible light regions using 385 nm and 400 nm cut-off filters, respectively, and the results are shown in Fig. 8b. The activity of ZnIn2S4/MoS2-40% wt is still higher than ZnIn2S4 under both UV-visible and visible regions, confirming that the introduction of MoS2 to ZnIn2S4 can improve the visible-light absorption ability. The H2 production rate of the synthesized ZnIn2S4/MoS2 photocatalyst in this work compared with the previous literature reports are shown in Table S3.† The difference in the H2 production rate could be caused by the variations in the synthesis method and the photocatalytic conditions such as the power of the light source and type/concentration of sacrificial reagents.61–63 The detailed discussions on the variations are provided in the ESI.†

3.2.3. Photocatalytic Cr(VI) reduction activity. 
The photocatalytic Cr(VI) reduction activities of the ZnIn2S4/MoS2-40% wt, ZnIn2S4 and MoS2 photocatalysts under visible light irradiation are shown in Fig. 9a. After 120 min of light irradiation, the ZnIn2S4/MoS2-40% wt photocatalyst exhibits the highest degree of photoreduction efficiency (82.8%) when compared with ZnIn2S4 (73.3%) and MoS2 (11.6%). The kinetics of the photocatalytic Cr(VI) reduction reaction in the presence of these photocatalysts are presented in Fig. 9b. The photoreduction of Cr(VI) follows the pseudo-first-order kinetic model: ln(C0/C) = kt, where C0 is the initial concentration of Cr(VI), C is the concentration of Cr(VI) at time t, t is the irradiation time and k is the kinetic rate constant (min−1). The k value of ZnIn2S4/MoS2-40% wt, determined from the slope of the line, is 1.4 × 10−2 min−1 which is 1.3 and 17.5 times higher than that of ZnIn2S4 (1.1 × 10−2 min−1) and MoS2 (0.8 × 10−3 min−1), respectively. Moreover, the photoreduction efficiency of ZnIn2S4/MoS2-40% wt is 1.7 times higher than that of the physical mixture (47.5% with a k value of 4.8 × 10−3 min−1). Furthermore, the AQY value of ZnIn2S4/MoS2-40% wt (0.91%) for Cr(VI) reduction reaction is about 1.2 times higher than that of ZnIn2S (0.76%). These findings demonstrate that MoS2 is an effective co-catalyst for improving the photocatalytic efficiency of the ZnIn2S4 photocatalyst. It should be noted that, in the blank experiment, the concentration of Cr(VI) is unchanged. This result clearly suggests that the presence of the photocatalyst is needed to achieve the Cr(VI) photoreduction and that the Cr(VI) ion would be stable during the photolytic reaction.

(c) Effect of pH of the solution and (d) pseudo-first-order kinetic plots of the Cr(VI) photoreduction in the presence of ZnIn2S4/MoS2-40% wt. 
The effect of pH of the solution on the photoreduction efficiency of the ZnIn2S4/MoS2-40% wt photocatalyst was also investigated under constant photocatalyst dosage and initial Cr(VI) concentration. As is presented in Fig. 9c and d, greater efficiency was obtained when the experiments were carried out in acidic solutions than when in alkaline solution; 95.3%, 82.8% and 59.2% of the photoreduction efficiency with k values of 1.4 × 10−2, 2.3 × 10−2 and 6.6 × 10−3 min−1 achieve at pH values of 4, 6 (initial pH) and 8, respectively. The efficiency of the composite photocatalyst decreases markedly with an increase in the pH of the solution. This result is related to the different forms of the oxidation state Cr(VI) in the different pH values of the solutions. Under acidic conditions, dichromate (Cr2O72−) and hydrogenchromate (HCrO4−) are the dominant forms of Cr(VI) species, while chromate (CrO42−) is the dominant species under basic condition.28 Additionally, it is easier to reduce Cr2O72− and HCrO4− ions by photo-generated electrons since the reduction potentials of Cr2O72−/Cr3+ (1.33 V vs. NHE) and HCrO4−/Cr3+ (1.35 V vs. NHE) are more positive than that of CrO42−/Cr(OH)3 (−0.13 V vs. NHE).64 Furthermore, the surface of the photocatalyst may be protonated under acidic conditions, which simplifies the negatively Cr(VI) species to be adsorbed.65 In addition, under alkaline conditions, the precipitated Cr(OH)3 that occurs in the system is deposited on the surface of the photocatalyst resulting in the decrease in photoreduction efficiency.66


3.2.4. Photocatalytic mechanisms for the H2 production and Cr(VI) reduction reactions. 
As a consequence of the matched overlapping band structures of ZnIn2S4 and MoS2 and the results from the photocatalytic reduction tests, either conventional type-II heterojunction (Fig. S7a†) or Z-scheme heterojunction (Fig. S7b†) could be formed.15,67 To investigate the charge transfer pathway in the ZnIn2S4/MoS2 heterostructure, a silver (Ag) photo-deposition experiment was carried out and the depositing of Ag on the composite was investigated by TEM. The procedures of this experiment are provided in the ESI.† The high-magnified TEM images (Fig. S8†) show that the MoS2 particle was deposited by Ag nanoparticle with a lattice fringe of 0.24 nm, which corresponds to the (111) plane of Ag. This result indicates that the reduction of Ag+ ion by light irradiation occurs on MoS2. This result implies that photo-generated electrons accumulate on the surface of MoS2 rather than on the surface of ZnIn2S4. Based on this result and the band positions of these two components, the photo-generated carrier transport mechanism occur through the type-II heterojunction between ZnIn2S4 and MoS2, in which electrons from CB of ZnIn2S4 migrate to CB of MoS2. This outcome is consistent with the findings of previous reports.21,23
A photocatalytic mechanism for the enhanced H2 production rate of the ZnIn2S4/MoS2 photocatalyst is presented in Fig. 10a. After ZnIn2S4/MoS2 is exposed to visible light radiation, the photo-generated electrons and holes are generated from the ZnIn2S4 and MoS2 components in the composite photocatalyst (eqn (1)). The photo-generated electrons are then transferred to their conduction bands (CB), leaving holes in their valence bands (VB). After that, the electrons can be transferred from CB of ZnIn2S4 to CB of MoS2 since the conduction band potential (ECB) of ZnIn2S4 (−1.00 V) is more negative than that of MoS2 (−0.07 V). Meanwhile, the holes are also transferred from VB of MoS2 to the VB of ZnIn2S4 because of the less positive valence band potential (EVB) of ZnIn2S4 (1.81 V). The accumulated electrons on CB of MoS2 can reduce H+ to generate H2 (eqn (2)) due to the more negative potential of its CB (−0.07 V) than the hydrogen reduction potential (H+/H2 = 0.00 V vs. NHE). Moreover, the adsorbed H+ ions on the exposed sulfur edges of MoS2 are easily reduced to H2 by the photo-generated electrons.68 Simultaneously, the holes in VB of ZnIn2S4 are consumed by the sacrificial reagents (eqn (3)) to generate oxidation products, substantially enhancing the photocatalytic H2 production activity.69 Therefore, this coupled system is favorable for the separation and migration of photo-generated charge carriers through the ZnIn2S4/MoS2 heterojunction at the interfacial interaction, which is a key factor in determining the photocatalytic H2 production activity. The step-wise photocatalytic H2 production mechanisms are provided as follows: ZnIn2S4/MoS2 + hν → ZnIn2S4/MoS2(e−CB + h+VB)(1) 2H+ + 2e−(CB of MoS2) → H2(2) Sacrificial agents + h+(VB of ZnIn2S4) → Oxidation products(3)
 Fig. 10  Schematic illustrations of the proposed mechanisms of the ZnIn2S4/MoS2 photocatalyst for (a) H2 production and (b) Cr(VI) reduction reactions under visible light irradiation. 
A photocatalytic mechanism for the enhanced Cr(VI) reduction efficiency of the ZnIn2S4/MoS2-40% wt composite is proposed in Fig. 10b. When the ZnIn2S4/MoS2-40% wt composite is excited by visible light radiation, both ZnIn2S4 and MoS2 components in the composite produce photo-generated electrons and holes (eqn (1)). The holes from VB of MoS2 can migrate to the VB of ZnIn2S4, and oxidize H2O to yield O2 (eqn (4)) owing to the less positive potential of O2/H2O (1.23 V vs. NHE) than the potential of VB of ZnIn2S4 (1.81 V).70 At the same time, the electrons from CB of ZnIn2S4 can rapidly be transferred to CB of MoS2, and then react with the Cr(VI) ion to Cr(III) ion (eqn (5)–(7)) owing to the more negative potential of CB of MoS2 (−0.07 V) than the potential of Cr(VI)/Cr(III).64 The step-wise photocatalytic Cr(VI) reduction mechanisms are provided as follows: ZnIn2S4/MoS2 + hν → ZnIn2S4/MoS2(e−CB + h+VB)(1) 2H2O + 4h+(VB of ZnIn2S4) → O2 + 4H+(4)under acidic conditions, Cr2O72− + 14H+ + 6e−(CB of MoS2) → 2Cr3+ + 7H2O(5) HCrO4− + 7H+ + 3e−(CB of MoS2) → Cr3+ + 4H2O(6)under basic condition, CrO42− + 4H2O + 3e−(CB of MoS2) → Cr(OH)3 + 5OH−(7)


3.2.5. Reusability and photocatalytic stability. 
The recycling of the experiments of the ZnIn2S4/MoS2-40% wt photocatalyst were carried out for photocatalytic H2 production and Cr(VI) reduction reactions under the same conditions to evaluate its photocatalytic stability. Fig. 11a shows the H2 production rate of the ZnIn2S4/MoS2-40% wt photocatalyst in comparison with ZnIn2S4. After three-cycles of use, the H2 production rate for the ZnIn2S4 photocatalyst is dramatically decreased. The ZnIn2S4 photocatalyst provides H2 production rate of 111.6, 67.3 and 39.2 μmol h−1 g−1, while the ZnIn2S4/MoS2-40% wt photocatalyst provides H2 production rate of 200.1, 198.3 and 196.6 μmol h−1 g−1 in the first, second and third runs, respectively. When compared with ZnIn2S4, the efficiency of ZnIn2S4/MoS2-40% wt photocatalyst shows insignificant losses after three cycle uses. The reusability of the ZnIn2S4/MoS2-40% wt photocatalyst for the H2 production reaction is found to be 98.3% after three cycle uses. A slight decrease in the reusability of the ZnIn2S4/MoS2-40% wt photocatalyst could be due to the loss of the photocatalyst amount during the recovery procedure. The recovered weight of the ZnIn2S4/MoS2-40% wt photocatalyst decreased from 0.100 to 0.942 and 0.895 mg from the first, second and third runs, respectively. Additionally, the recycling experiments for the Cr(VI) photoreduction in a pH solution of 4 was also performed to evaluate the stability of the ZnIn2S4/MoS2-40% wt photocatalyst in a strong acidic environment. As is presented in Fig. 11b, the photoreduction efficiency slightly decrease from 95.3% to 93.1% and 92.8% in the first, second and third runs, respectively. The efficiency of the ZnIn2S4/MoS2-40% wt photocatalyst remains at high levels after the third cycle. The used ZnIn2S4/MoS2-40% wt photocatalyst after the three-run photocatalytic H2 production and Cr(vI) reduction reactions was collected and analyzed by SEM and XRD. The SEM images of the used photocatalyst for both reactions (Fig. 11c and d) reveal that the morphology is retained after the three-cycling test. In addition, the XRD patterns (Fig. 11e) of this used photocatalyst are similar to the fresh photocatalyst without the addition of impurity peaks. These results demonstrate that the ZnIn2S4/MoS2-40% wt photocatalyst possesses good reusability and stability with effective photocatalytic activity for H2 production and Cr(VI) reduction reactions. These outcomes could be that the intimate contact between ZnIn2S4 and MoS2 particles in the composite favors the vectorial transfer of photo-generated electrons from CB of ZnIn2S4 to MoS2, which is beneficial for preventing the reduction of Zn2+ and In3+ ions in the composite.12,71

4. Conclusions
The flower-like ZnIn2S4 microspheres with multi-cavities and the series of ZnIn2S4/MoS2 photocatalysts were successfully synthesized using the biomolecule-assisted microwave heating method. The loading amount of MoS2 played an important role on photocatalytic H2 production under UV-visible light irradiation. Among all the fabricated ZnIn2S4/MoS2 photocatalysts, ZnIn2S4/MoS2-40% wt provided the highest level of photocatalytic activity for H2 production and was higher than ZnIn2S4 under UV-visible and visible regions; 200.1 and 50.0 μmol h−1 g−1 under UV-visible and visible light irradiation, respectively. In addition, this photocatalyst also displayed the greatest photocatalytic activity for Cr(VI) reduction under visible light irradiation. The Cr(VI) solution at pH 4 was reduced by up to 95.3% within 120 min. Moreover, the ZnIn2S4/MoS2-40% wt photocatalyst also displayed good stability and recycling performance after three tests. The enhanced photocatalytic performance and photostability of ZnIn2S4/MoS2-40% wt were attributed to the increase in visible-light response and efficient separation and migration of photo-generated charge carriers derived by the formation of the type-II heterojunction structure between ZnIn2S4 and MoS2. Notably, this ZnIn2S4/MoS2 heterojunction is a potential efficient visible-light-responsive photocatalyst for water splitting and for the removal of heavy metals in industrial wastewater.
