    , Accepted 30th April 2020First published on 1st May 2020AbstractThe two-dimensional (2D) Ruddlesden–Popper (RP) hybrid organic inorganic perovskite (HOIP) has emerged as a great alternative to its conventional three-dimensional (3D) counterpart, owing to its superior structural integrity under humid conditions. Despite extensive studies on halide doping in 3D perovskites to obtain better optoelectronic properties, understanding of optoelectronic properties through doping engineering of the 2D-RP perovskite is still limited. Using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we evaluate the optical and electronic properties of Cl-doped lead-free 2D-RP hybrid perovskite, (CH3(CH2)3NH3)2(CH3NH3)Sn2I7−xClx. We calculate key functional descriptors such as the electronic band structures, high-frequency dielectric constant, exciton binding energy and absorption spectrum. The properties are additionally analyzed from the aspect of atomic level chemical bonds between Sn and halide, X (I and Cl). We demonstrate that the incorporation of Cl into 2D-RP HOIPs should enhance the excitonic property and form strong local ferroelectric domains, which reduces the charge recombination rate. Yet, degradation of absorption intensity in the visible light regime observed in the Cl-doped 3D system is not noticeable in its 2D counterpart. Our ab initio results propose a smart design principle and elucidate the mechanism for the optoelectronic functionality of Cl-doped low dimensional hybrid perovskite optimized for various electronic devices.
Introduction
The three-dimensional (3D) hybrid organic–inorganic perovskite (HOIP), i.e., (CH3NH3)PbI3, has drawn focused attention due to its low fabrication cost and high photovoltaic (PV) efficiency.1–6 Unlike commercialized silicon and copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS)-based solar cells, the HOIPs are easier to fabricate using a simple solution process with earth-abundant chemical species. Their power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) are competitive with conventionally popular PV materials owing to strong absorption in the visible light range. Furthermore, the low carrier recombination rate, defect resistance and long carrier diffusion length render them promising alternatives to commercialized ones.
In spite of the favorable properties, 3D HOIPs still face serious scientific and technological challenges that must be overcome before their wider commercialization. Most 3D HOIPs with high PCEs contain water-soluble Pb as an indispensable component, which causes significant environmental concern. This is because most conventional HOIPs lack chemical and structural integrity in a humid environment due to strong interaction between water molecules and hydrophilic chemical components.7,8 Particularly, it was found that the 3D HOIPs are strikingly vulnerable to moisture and rapidly degraded. For example, the normalized absorbance of (CH3NH3)PbI3-based solar cells dropped to 40% within approximately 10 hours of exposure in humidified air.8 To solve this critical problem, two-dimensional (2D) Ruddlesden–Popper (RP) HOIPs have emerged9–19 as alternatives, which have enhanced stability against moist environments by protecting the structures from water molecules using hydrophobic organic chains.
The general chemical formula of the 2D-RP HOIPs is (RNH3)2(M)n−1BnX3n+1, where RNH3, M, n, B and X represent an organic cation spacer with a long carbon chain, i.e., butylammonium (BA), a monovalent small organic cation, i.e., methylammonium (MA), a number of BX6−4 octahedron layers, a divalent metal and a halide species, respectively. Here, the hydrophobic carbon chain in the organic spacer, integrated between layers of perovskite, is known as a key material to improve the structural stability of 2D-RP HOIPs under humid conditions.10 In addition to enhancing the resistance to moisture, it also stabilizes excitons at room temperature by creating quantum wells formed by sandwiched structures, which result in strong photoluminescence (PL) for light emitting diodes (LEDs).11,14,17,19 For application in PV cells, the PCE in solar cells is still behind the conventional ones due to the absence of inorganic connectivity in one direction.10,12,13
Along with such structural innovation, substantial attempts have been made to improve the optoelectronic properties of conventional HOIPs. It was reported that the incorporation of foreign halide atoms into the 3D HOIP can boost the electron trap density and the charge transport ability along with creating large crystal grains.20–22 In particular, small amounts of substitutional doping of Cl to I sites (MAPbI3−xClx) results in extremely long charge carrier diffusion lengths.23 From computational studies, He et al.24 insisted that the fundamental mechanism behind the prolonged carrier diffusion length upon Cl-doping is increased electron–hole pair separation facilitated by the local ferroelectric domain created since MA ions are aligned in a specific direction. Furthermore, using time-domain ab initio molecular dynamic simulations, Liu et al.25 proposed that Cl in MAPbI3 can reduce electron–hole pair recombination by creating vibration modes at higher frequencies in the inorganic framework and by providing broader ranges of vibrational degrees of freedom for the coupling of electrons. For the behaviors, the fact that the doped Cl is much lighter and smaller than the replaced I atom is generally accepted as the working principle.
In contrast to the 3D HOIPs, attempts to carry out Cl-doping into 2D-RP HOIPs are rare, although they show higher structural integrity against humidity. Recently, Chen et al.16 investigated the role of Cl in PV cells made of quasi-2D-RP HOIPs with more than 10 layers of perovskite octahedra. They designed different series of lead-based mixes of halide-doped RP HOIPs and macroscopically replaced PbI6−4 with PbCl6−4 octahedral domains. It was claimed that a champion PCE of 12.78% was achieved along with enhanced stability compared to that of the 3D analogue. Yet, the underlying mechanism behind the effect of low concentration Cl-doping in two-dimensional perovskite is still unclear.
Here, we present the distinctive impact of Cl-doping in low dimensional lead-free 2D-RP HOIP materials, (BA)2(MA)Sn2I7−xClx, towards optoelectronic applications. Using first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations on pristine and Cl-incorporated 2D-RP HOIPs and their 3D analogues, we characterize the band gaps, effective masses, dielectric properties and exciton binding energies to identify key optoelectronic properties. Our results show that the Cl-dopant enhances asymmetry not only in Sn–halide bonds in the octahedron but also in the charge distribution of the inorganic framework of the 2D-RP HOIPs compared to their 3D counterpart. Additionally, Cl-doping results in negligible absorption loss in 2D systems, while it causes a notable decrease in 3D systems. Throughout the study, we show how the Cl-dopant behaves in different dimensionalities and find that it essentially increases the charge transport ability and excitonic properties of 2D-RP HOIPs that are pertinent to various optoelectronic applications.
Computational methods
All DFT calculations in this study were performed using the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) generalized gradient approximation (GGA),26 as implemented in the Vienna Ab initio Simulations Package (VASP).27 The cutoff energy for the plane wave was set to 450 eV, and the projector-augmented wave (PAW) method28 was used. All model systems were optimized until the total energy and the force converged within 10−4 eV and 0.02 eV Å−1, respectively. The van der Waals (vdW) interaction between the organics and inorganics was described using the DFT-D3 correction by Grimme.29 For 3D (MASnI3 and MASnI3−xClx) and 2D ((BA)2(MA)Sn2I7 and (BA)2(MA)Sn2I7−xClx) models, 4 × 3 × 4 and 3 × 1 × 3 gamma-centered k-point schemes were employed, respectively. Considering the tremendous computational costs, we did not use nor consider beyond DFT methods such as the hybrid functional or spin–orbit coupling (SOC) effects for electronic structure calculations. Instead, we focused on identifying the key trend in the relative variation of optoelectronic properties of the 3D and 2D HOIP models with the incorporated Cl. Previously, it was reported that computational outcomes without relativistic considerations are still useful and reasonably agree with experimental observations.30–32 Indeed, Sn, unlike Pb, showed a small deviation upon exclusion of SOC effects in previous literature reports.33,34 For further justification, we compared the electronic band structures of MASnI3, as shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). SOC correction for MASnI3 further reduced its band gap by 0.25 eV with marginal change of the curvature in the CBM, implying slight differences in effective masses. We evaluated high-frequency dielectric constants and frequency-dependent dielectric functions using density functional perturbation theory (DFPT)31,35–38 based on independent particle approximation as implemented in the VASP. We applied scissor operators to the absorption spectra obtained by the PBE-GGA functional calculations and shifted them to reasonable ranges in accordance with the experimental values of pristine models. Finally, the electronic band structures were plotted using the SUMO package.39
Results and discussion
1. Crystal structures
Depending on the thermal conditions in the experimental synthesis, crystalline 3D HOIPs are known to form one of three polymorphs: orthorhombic, tetragonal and cubic phases.40 In this study, we selected the orthorhombic MASnI3 (Fig. 1a) as a model system for 3D systems. As shown in Fig. 1b, we calculated two different doping sites for Cl: ① apical and ② equatorial positions. In accordance with the previous study by Colella et al.,30 in which the doping concentration of Cl in a tri-iodide hybrid perovskite was approximately 3–4%, we fixed the doping levels to at most 4%. Our calculations showed that doping sites for Cl are almost in a degenerated state as the energy difference was only 9 meV per Sn. The lattice parameters of MASnI2.88Cl0.12 (Table 1) showed volume contractions of 1.2% and 1.4% when Cl was incorporated into the apical and equatorial sites, respectively.

For the 2D HOIP models, we chose the (BA)2(MA)n−1SnnI3n+1 series with n = 2 (the number of perovskite layers). When n = 1, the octahedral framework made by the perovskite layers disappears, leaving the system with only BA+ spacers between the perovskite layers. In this case, the chemical interaction between the MA ion inside the octahedral cage and Cl in the inorganic framework cannot be described well. Therefore, (BA)2(MA)Sn2I7 was chosen as a pristine 2D model to effectively reduce the computational cost but to account for the interaction between MA+ and Cl. As shown in Fig. 1c, it consists of two perovskite layers connected by the corner-sharing SnI6−4 octahedrons. MA ions are placed inside the cage of the octahedrons, and the cages are separated by long carbon chains of the organic spacers (BA+), which are the key to maintaining the dimensionality of the 2D-RP HOIPs. We then set up and optimized the pristine 2D model, as reported in previous studies by Stoumpos et al.12 and Wang et al.36 The lattice parameters listed in Table 1, which were calculated using the PBE-GGA functional with the D3 correction, are in reasonable agreement with the experimental measurements9 with 0.02% error in volume per formula unit.
We doped 3.6% Cl atoms at three different sites (① apical, ② equatorial and ③ apical sharing) in the optimized pristine 2D-RP HOIP, as shown in Fig. 1d. The DFT calculations indicated that the apical site was slightly more favorable for Cl-doping. This is ascribed to the fact that there is only one chemical bond between Cl and Sn, located at the center of the octahedron. Nevertheless, the energy differences between the apical and other sites are marginal (25 meV per Sn for the equatorial site and 27 meV per Sn for the apical sharing site), similar to the 3D models. This implies that these sites are degenerate for Cl-doping energies.
2. Electronic properties
As shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. S1 (ESI†), we calculated the electronic band structures to identify the distinct electronic properties of all systems. All model systems show direct band gaps, in which the contribution of p-orbitals in Sn is dominant at the conduction band minimum (CBM), while that of p-orbitals of I is dominant at the valence band maximum (VBM). Here, the contributions from the organic species to the electronic band structures were neglected for clarity, as they barely participate in the CBM and VBM energy levels.37 Interestingly, there is an insignificant contribution to the VBM energy levels by the doped Cl of all model systems. This observation implies that the band gap or energy levels of the Cl-doped 2D-RP HOIPs change only slightly from the features of its clean counterpart.
 Fig. 2  Electronic band structure calculated using the PBE functional for (a) pristine 3D MASnI3, (b) MASnI2.88Cl0.12 with Cl in the equatorial site, (c) pristine 2D (BA)2(MA)Sn2I7 and (d) (BA)2(MA)Sn2I6.86Cl0.14 with Cl in the apical site. Each site presented here is the most stable configuration. The electronic band structures for other systems are illustrated in Fig. S1 (ESI†). 
Then, we calculated the effective masses of electrons and holes using eqn (1): (1)where m*, ℏ, k and ε(k) represent the effective mass, Dirac's constant, wave vector, and eigenvalue of energy corresponding to the given k, respectively. The calculated values for band gaps and effective masses are presented in Table S1 (ESI†). Although the band gaps were underestimated due to the use of the PBE-GGA functional, we can still capture the key features of optoelectronic properties upon Cl incorporation into our model systems. The band gaps for pristine systems of 3D MASnI3 and 2D (BA)2(MA)Sn2I7 were estimated as 0.699 eV and 0.795 eV, respectively, whereas the experimental ones were 1.20 eV and 1.64 eV, respectively. As expected, the band gap of (BA)2(MA)Sn2I7 was larger compared to that of MASnI3 mainly due to the absence of an inorganic perovskite framework in the [010] direction.36–38 When 4% Cl was doped into the 3D model, MASnI2.88Cl0.12 with Cl in both the apical and equatorial sites showed minimal decreases in electron and hole effective masses, while the band gaps increased (0.699 eV to 0.725 eV and 0.715 eV, respectively), as the ionic bonding nature of Sn–Cl was greater than that of Sn–I. With a Cl-doping level of 3.6% into (BA)2(MA)Sn2I7, the trend for band gap changes of (BA)2(MA)Sn2I6.86Cl0.14 were different from that of the 3D counterpart, depending on the doping sites. When Cl was incorporated into the apical site, the band gap slightly increased from 0.795 eV to 0.821 eV, which was similar to that of the 3D analogue. Interestingly, Cl-dopant at the equatorial or apical sharing site drastically changed the band gap to 0.948 eV and 0.628 eV, respectively.
These dramatic variations in the band gap changes in the Cl-doped 2D-RP HOIPs from their 3D counterpart cannot be explained just by the stronger ionic characteristic of the Sn–Cl bonds since the doped Cl barely contributes to the VBM or CBM energy levels, as shown in Fig. 2. Therefore, we analyzed the bonding structures among the chemical species in the 2D-RP HOIPs. It is known that most HOIP materials have intrinsically tilted octahedra due to the hydrogen bonding between organic species and inorganic frameworks, by which their band gaps and effective masses are modified from perfectly ordered structures.32,41,42 Since the Sn–Cl bond is 0.33 Å shorter than Sn–I, further distortion of the octahedra is expected. As presented in Fig. S2 and Table S2 (ESI†), the bond distances of Sn–Cl at the apical and equatorial sites were calculated as 2.94 Å and 2.82 Å, respectively, for the 3D models and 2.82 Å and 2.67 Å, respectively, for the 2D models. Notably, the Sn–Cl bond shrinkage was greater in the 2D systems because their perovskite frameworks have more orientational degrees of freedom than the 3D systems do. In the case of 3D HOIPs, these inorganic frames have periodic connections in all directions, which therefore makes the Cl-dopant stiffly fixed at its position. In contrast, the frames in 2D-RP HOIPs are relatively free to translate or rotate as they are hung between hydrocarbon chains of organic spacers. Thus, substitutional Cl-doping in 2D-RP HOIPs engenders a shorter Sn–Cl bond distance. This is a crucial finding as it was previously claimed that the specific configuration of octahedra is one of the key descriptors36,41 for tuning the optoelectronic properties of HOIP in terms of in-plane orbital overlapping.
To understand the correlation between the bond distance and the tilting of the octahedron, the bonding angles of Sn–X–Sn (X = Cl, I) in 3D and 2D HOIPs were compared, as shown in Fig. 3 and Fig. S3 (ESI†). In the pristine 3D MASnI3, the Sn–I–Sn bond angles changed slightly regardless of the Cl incorporation at the apical (Sn–I–Sn: 152.6°) and equatorial (Sn–Cl–Sn: 151.5°) sites, from the original Sn–I–Sn angle of 152.6°. In contrast, the corresponding angle in the pristine 2D (BA)2(MA)Sn2I7 was 145.4° in the upper layer and 164.6° in the lower layer; this difference was caused by the orientation of the MA+ ions at the sites. When Cl was substituted at the apical site, the upper and lower Sn–I–Sn angles were 144.6° and 164.1°, respectively, showing almost no variation from the pristine state.
 Fig. 3  Calculated Sn–X–Sn (X = Cl, I) bonding angle (θ), charge density difference plot and Bader charge analysis for the upper perovskite layers of (a) (BA)2(MA)Sn2I7 and (b) (BA)2(MA)Sn2I6.86Cl0.14 and for (c) MASnI3 and (d) MASnI2.88Cl0.12 both with Cl-doped at the equatorial site for intuitive comparison. Organic molecules are excluded for clarity in the charge density difference plot. 
Interestingly, the angles dramatically changed when Cl was incorporated in the other sites (i.e., the equatorial and apical sharing positions). The 2D system doped with Cl in the equatorial site had an upper Sn–Cl–Sn bond angle of 155.0° and a lower bond angle of 163.2°. The notable band gap increase for Cl-doping in the equatorial site can be explained by the reduction in the number of in-plane Sn–I bonds, which made a major contribution to the electronic band structure, and a decrease in the Sn–I–Sn bond (placed on the same layer as Cl) angle from 164.1° to 154.9° due to the tensile strain caused by the doped Cl. Here, the deviation from 180° in the Sn–I–Sn bond angle weakens the in-plane orbital overlap between Sn and I, which eventually enlarges the band gap as well as the effective masses of the electrons and holes.36,42
In contrast, the HOIPs with Cl at the apical sharing site showed a distinct increment in Sn–I–Sn bond angle (180.0°) in the lower layer, while in the upper layer, it was not changed from that of the pristine 2D system. The relatively stronger chemical interaction of Sn–Cl in the upper layer caused the lower layer to interact more loosely with doped Cl, which is shown in the increased Sn–I–Sn bond angle to 180.0°. This dissimilarity enhances the in-plane orbital interaction between Sn and I in the lower layer and thus decreases the band gap and the effective masses, as the antibonding interaction between the p orbitals of Sn and I is further augmented via the orbital overlapping.41 However, the effects may be less noticeable as the number of perovskite layers increases since the SnI6−4 octahedra become more rigidly connected, almost like the bulk phase.
As different degrees of distortions were observed in the 2D and 3D systems, we attempted to identify how the symmetry of the charge distribution influenced the optoelectronic properties. Thus, to visualize the change in charge distribution, the in-plane charge density difference was plotted to observe the interaction between Sn and halides using eqn (2): Δρ = ρtotal − ρSn − ρOrgX(2)where ρtotal, ρSn and ρOrgX each represents the charge density of a total system, of Sn atoms, and of organics and halides. Then, relative values for charge depletion (blue) and accumulation (red) were calculated via Bader charge analysis.43 For both 3D and 2D pristine models, charge distributions on Sn–I–Sn bonds were symmetric: +0.92 charge depletion on both Sn atoms and −0.55 charge accumulation on the I atom (Fig. 3a and c). Nonetheless, Cl-dopant in the 2D system at the equatorial site induced charge asymmetry by causing further charge depletion on Sn atoms to +1.00 and +0.95 from +0.92, while that in the 3D system did not influence the symmetry in charge distribution. This was also clearly noticeable in the in-plane charge density difference plot, which showed lopsided charge depletion (Fig. 3d) toward Cl between two Sn atoms.
As expected, the other models with Cl atoms at the equatorial and apical sharing sites also showed strong charge depletion of the nearest Sn atom. The 2D HOIPs definitely showed higher asymmetry in their charge distribution than did the 3D model in general (Fig. S3, ESI†) due to the relatively short bond distance of Sn–Cl because it allows an electronegative Cl atom to take away more charge from the nearest Sn atom. This asymmetry is known to considerably contribute to the longer diffusion length of the charge carrier in MAPbI3−xClx and to facilitate electron–hole pair separation by local ferroelectric domains created by the heterogeneous directional alignment of MA+ ions.20,23,24 Originally, MA+ ions in dopant-free 3D systems were expected to randomly rotate at ambient temperature as they have low rotational energy barriers,44 which results in almost zero net ferroelectricity. However, like the case of MAPbI3−xClx, the presence of doped foreign halide species causes MA+ ions to interact with the dopant, aligning them into specific directions.24 Such an effect can be enhanced when the system is reduced to a 2D structure with a few perovskite layers, where organic spacers, in addition to the doped halide, can interact with the organic ions inside the inorganic frames.
Here, as the magnitude of ferroelectricity can be described by the degree of asymmetry in directional spontaneous polarization, the difference between polarizabilities (Δχ) in the in-plane directions of each system was calculated. To examine the effect of Cl-doping on local ferroelectricity, we first calculated anisotropic polarizability volume normalized by volume per Sn atom (Table 2) of the 2D and 3D model systems using eqn (3):7 (3)where V is the volume of the system per Sn atom and ε∞ is the high frequency dielectric constant. The calculated high frequency dielectric constants (Table 2) of the 3D models are in good agreement with the ones for MASnI3 and MASnI2Cl systems previously studied by He et al.18 As the majority of charge transport occurs in the x and z directions in the case of 2D-RP HOIPs, we mainly compared the polarizabilities in the x and z directions and calculated the magnitude of the difference, Δχ, as shown in Fig. 4. For all systems, Cl-doping increased Δχ, indicating the reinforced local ferroelectric characteristic as previously proposed. Especially, the asymmetries of in-plane polarizabilities were notable in the 2D systems in general, due to the further distortion in Sn–halide bonds with a shorter Sn–Cl bond distance as previously discussed. As 2D-RP HOIPs are known to already have an advantage in charge transport over 3D HOIPs,10,13 owing to the directionality engendered by their dimensionality, we can expect Cl-doping to augment it with local ferroelectricity. This distinctive ferroelectric characteristic in the 2D systems implies a further contribution of Cl-doping in reducing electron–hole recombination rate and increasing the density of free carriers and charge carrier diffusion length, which are key aspects for designing PL and PV devices with high efficiency.4,11,45

3. Optical properties
Furthermore, we examined how exciton binding energies changed with dimensionalities and Cl-doping. The binding energy of an exciton in the ground-state was evaluated using the Mott–Wannier model31,38 as described in eqn (4): (4)where mr* is the reduced mass and ε∞ is the high-frequency dielectric constant. For all 3D HOIPs, the exciton binding energies were calculated (Table S1, ESI†) to be small and almost consistent (39–49 meV), regardless of Cl-doping. In contrast, the exciton binding energy of the 2D pristine (BA)2(MA)Sn2I7 system was dramatically increased to 126 meV, which can be ascribed to the quantum confinement effect. When Cl was substituted in the apical site, the energy marginally decreased. On the other hand, for doping at the equatorial and apical sharing sites, the exciton binding energy increased up to 178 meV and 157 meV, respectively. The reason for the greater increase in the exciton binding energies in the 2D HOIPs via Cl-doping is largely the higher asymmetry involved in the charge distribution. This is, in turn, caused by shorter Sn–Cl bonds in the 2D HOIPs than in the 3D HOIPs. The high exciton binding energy in 2D HOIPs enhances the PL efficiency, which is favorable for LED devices working at room temperature.11,14,17
We then calculated the frequency-dependent absorption spectra of 2D and 3D HOIPs using DFPT calculations based on independent particle approximation (IPA), where excitonic effects and local-field corrections are excluded. The calculated results based on IPA were reported to be reasonable for bulk semiconductors when the PAW method is employed.46,47 Each of the real and imaginary parts of the frequency-dependent dielectric constants from the optimized structures was evaluated. The absorption coefficient α(ω) was evaluated using eqn (5):31,36–38 (5)where ε1(ω) and ε2(ω) represent the real and imaginary dielectric constants for a frequency ω, respectively, while c is the speed of light in a vacuum. Since the relativistic effect was neglected in this study, the absorption peaks appeared in lower energy regime like the case of underestimated band gaps. To correctly represent the probable absorption range, we shifted the calculated absorption energy level using scissor operators of 0.845 eV for (BA)2(MA)Sn2I7−xClx and 0.499 eV for MASnI3−xClx, in accordance with previous experiments by Cao et al.9
The intensity of 2D HOIP for the absorption spectra is smaller than that of 3D HOIP due to the deficiency of active inorganic species toward light absorption as discussed in the introduction. Regardless of the dimensionality, however, all show strong values in the visible light range (1.7–3.3 eV). Interestingly, when Cl was doped into MASnI3, the absorption intensity decreased, while those of the 2D systems maintained their peak (Fig. 5). Moreover, in the anisotropic absorption spectra (Fig. S5, ESI†), the 3D HOIPs lost the absorption intensity in all directions, while almost no loss was observed in the 2D system. We think that the principal reason for this difference is the different dimensionality. In the 3D HOIP, the Sn–Cl bonding characteristic (i.e., low absorption in the low energy region) is notably effective in all directions. It is less influential, however, in 2D systems, since the perovskite layers are disconnected in the [010] direction.37 Thus, HOIPs with doped Cl at sites other than the equatorial site, where Sn–Cl bonding is directly related to the in-plane absorption, maintained their absorption intensities. Assuming that all doping sites are almost degenerate, the absorption loss in 3D HOIP caused by doped Cl should be minimized in 2D HOIP. In short, for substitutional doping of Cl for I in 2D HOIP, the low dimensionality induces a high exciton binding energy and marginal loss of the light absorption intensity.
 Fig. 5  Calculated absorption spectra from frequency-dependent dielectric constant and of (a) MASnI3−xClx, and (b) (BA)2(MA)Sn2I7−xClx, where 1, 2 and 3 represent Cl-doping in the apical, equatorial and apical sharing sites, respectively. To compensate for the underestimation caused by the PBE-GGA functional, a scissor operator of 0.845 eV and 0.499 eV was employed for (a) and (b), respectively. 
Conclusions
In summary, we elucidated the atomistic mechanism behind the effect of low-concentration Cl-doping on the optoelectronic properties of lead-free 2D-RP HOIP, (BA)2(MA)Sn2I7−xClx. Our DFT calculation results indicated that the doping of Cl into (BA)2(MA)Sn2I7−xClx shortens the Sn–Cl bond length, which enhances the asymmetry of the charge distribution. The higher asymmetry of the charge distribution caused by doped Cl in 2D HOIP facilitates the formation of local ferroelectric domains, which is one of the essential parameters for free carrier density and long carrier diffusion length. Moreover, we found that Cl-doping into 2D systems dramatically increases the exciton binding energy with negligible loss of light absorption intensity, unlike their 3D analogues. This is another key feature that can be used as a design principle for few layered and two-dimensional RP HOIP to achieve desirable optoelectronic properties.
