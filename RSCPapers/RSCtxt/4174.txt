    , Accepted 7th September 2012First published on 28th September 2012AbstractThe shortage of fossil fuels and the need to find alternative renewable and sustainable fuels for transportation are triggering an increasing interest in the photocatalytic reduction of CO2. In this review, we have focused on titanium containing photocatalysts that effect the reduction of CO2 to fuels. The various products that are more generally formed are CH4, CH3OH, CO as well as HCOOH. This review has been organized primarily depending on the type of titanium material used as the photocatalyst. The list includes pure TiO2 as well as metal- and non metal-doped titania, noble metals supported on titania and micro-/mesoporous titanosilicates or porous matrices containing titania clusters. In a general introduction we comment on the limitations of the current approaches and the various possibilities and conditions for performing the irradiation. In a final section, we also give our view on future developments and open issues to be addressed in this field.

Broader context
Due to the shortage of fossil fuels, there is a need for developing renewable fuels for transportation. One possibility is to use photocatalysis to reduce CO2 to form CH3OH or CH4 and other compounds. Among the various types of photocatalysts, titania and related materials have been the most widely used for the catalytic CO2 photoreduction. The different modifications of titania to increase the photocatalytic activity for the production of solar fuels have been reviewed. The present situation of the state of the art indicates that much more efficient and selective photocatalysts are still needed to develop a photocatalytic process with promise for commercial application.

1. Scope and organization of the review
This review describes the use of TiO2 and modified TiO2 as photocatalysts for the photoreduction of CO2 to fuels covering up to the beginning of 2012. Our review complements others that have also focused on the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 by different types of homogeneous or heterogeneous photocatalytic systems.1–13
In the first sections we will describe those titanium containing materials that are active only under UV irradiation and in the second part of the review the results obtained under visible light photolysis will be described. Each of these two sections has been organized according to the type of titanium material used as the photocatalyst, including not only undoped or doped TiO2 but also micro-/mesoporous solids in which titanium atoms or clusters of titanium atoms are hosted or grafted on the walls of porous matrices. In a final section we will summarize the present state of the art making emphasis on the open issues and forecasting further developments in the field.
2. Introduction
Due to the shortage and restrictions on the use of fossil fuels and continuous increase in energy demand, there is a large interest in developing alternative renewable energy resources.8,14–20 Particularly for transportation, one of the possible alternatives is to use as fuel some chemicals that will act as energy vectors from the primary energy resource to the vehicle. Considering that the Sun is one of the inexhaustible, primary energy sources, there is much current interest in developing fuels obtained from sunlight.15,16,21–24 Among the various possibilities including thermal reactions and conversion of light into electricity, one alternative could be photocatalysis in which photons coming from the Sun and reaching the Earth surface hit on a material (“photocatalyst”) and their energy is converted by the energy of the light into chemical energy.8,25–33 Of the possible “solar fuels” the ones that have attracted more attention are H2 derived from H2O and CH3OH, CH4 and CO derived from CO2 reduction.8,32,33 H2 obtained from H2O using sunlight and oxidized at low temperatures using fuel cells is probably the cleanest possible, CO2-neutral energy vector for transportation. However, there are still some problems associated with the hydrogen technology and in particular H2 storage under ambient conditions and pressure that make the use of H2 far from being applicable in a massive scale.34–39 In contrast, solar fuels derived from CO2 can also be neutral from the CO2 balance point of view and offer as advantage the use of liquid chemicals (i.e. CH3OH) or chemicals that have been already used in massive quantity (i.e. CH4 and CO). In addition, fuel cells can operate equally well using CH3OH as the feed, thus allowing a smooth transition towards novel transportation technologies not based on combustion engines.
One of the differences between photocatalytic water splitting and photocatalytic CO2 reduction is that in the first case H2O can act as an oxidant (generation of H2) and a reducing agent (generation of O2) and, therefore, the possibility of operation of an overall water splitting process in which H2O is converted into H2 and O2 without the need of any additional compound can be envisioned. In contrast, reduction of CO2 and specifically the formation of CH3OH and CH4 require a reducing compound acting as the hydrogen source. Among the various possibilities, the most attractive but scientifically more challenging is the use of H2O as the reducing agent. The process of the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 by H2O is considerably more difficult than the overall water splitting due to the higher endoergonicity of the process.40 Sources of hydrogen other than H2O such as H2 gas or even NH3 will be more favorable from the view point of the efficiency of the process, but will require the prior preparation of these reducing agents since they are not available as primary feed stocks.  H2O(l) → H2(g) + 1/2 O2(g), ΔGo(298 K) = +237 kJ mol−1
The state of the art in the photocatalytic CO2 reduction is far from being optimal and there are still considerable breakthroughs to be made before it can be considered as a viable economical process.9 In fact, in order to have a positive energy balance in the generation of fuels from CO2 it is necessary to use sunlight exclusively. The problem is that the vast majority of photocatalysts that have some efficiency for CO2 photoreduction do not exhibit photoresponse with visible light11 and therefore there is still a need for developing visible light photocatalysts for this process.9,41 In fact, a large percentage of the reports in the literature describing some activity in the photocatalytic CO2 reduction are based on titania,42 mostly in the anatase phase.9,13 Commercial P25 is one of the preferred photocatalysts due to its availability and reproducibility.
2.1 Doping of titania
Titania exhibits activity only when irradiated at wavelengths shorter than the one corresponding to the band gap energy (λ < 380 nm). To circumvent this strong limitation of an exclusive UV response, a general methodology involving doping of titania has been implemented.28 Initially the doping elements were transition metals that in minute quantities can replace titanium atoms in the lattice introducing empty orbitals at energies below the conduction band (CB) of pure TiO2. A problem that has been frequently encountered with the metal doping is the so-called photocorrosion. This consists in the reorganization of the crystal lattice during operation resulting in the leaching of the dopant metal out of the crystal framework.43–45 The problem of corrosion mainly affects the stability and durability of the photocatalyst.
A more recent doping strategy has been the replacement of oxygen in the lattice by oxygen vacancies or non-metallic elements such as nitrogen, sulfur and carbon.28 In this type of doping, occupied orbitals are introduced above the energy of the valence band (VB), thus resulting in narrowing of the energy gap. Scheme 1 illustrates the differences between the two doping alternatives. It has been claimed that doping by non-metallic elements renders more durable and stable photocatalysts,46,47 but there is still much work to be done before a general consensus is reached on the advantages of doping by non-metallic elements.
 Scheme 1  Alternative TiO2 doping by replacing Ti by other transition metals and introducing empty orbitals below the CB of pure TiO2 or by replacing some O atoms of the TiO2 lattice by other non-metallic elements such as N or S and introducing filled orbitals above the VB of TiO2. 
In the particular case of CO2 photoreduction, one of the favorite doped titania, in terms of the number of reports that have described its use as a photocatalyst, is copper-doped titania.48 The reasons for this choice are based on empirical facts and in order to obtain a more complete picture of the doping effect it will be of interest to perform a systematic screening of the influence of metal and non-metallic titania doping on photocatalytic CO2 reduction. There is no doubt that further understanding of the experimental results and the influence of the nature of the dopant, its quantity and possibly its framework or non-framework location on the photocatalytic activity49 could be achieved by theoretical calculations.
Deposition of noble metal nanoparticles, and particularly platinum, may play a beneficial effect on the efficiency of a photocatalytic process,50–52 due to the occurrence of at least two different effects. On one hand, particularly for gas evolution and especially for H2 evolution, it has been found that the presence of a noble metal with the role of a hydrogenation catalyst facilitates kinetics of H2 gas formation from H2O. A second role of the noble metal nanoparticles, besides acting as catalytic sites, is the promotion of more efficient charge separation after light excitation. To observe the beneficial effect of the presence of noble metal nanoparticles, the loading should not exceed a maximum value, since otherwise these metallic nanoparticles will act as recombination centers trapping electrons and holes simultaneously, promoting the wasteful charge recombination.
Recently, the previous general scheme of the effect of metal nanoparticles on conventional photocatalysts has been expanded by adding a third effect in the case of metal nanoparticles, such as gold, that have a strong surface plasmon band in the visible region.53 It has been found that it is possible to excite selectively the gold surface plasmon band with visible light, and electrons expelled from the metal nanoparticles can have enough energy to move to the conduction band of the semiconductor.54–56 In this way, the metal nanoparticles acting as an antenna will produce visible light sensitization of the semiconductor.57–60Scheme 2 shows the differences in the location of electrons and holes between the UV and visible light sensitization of the Au–TiO2 photocatalyst.
 Scheme 2  Plasmon photocatalysis in which visible light excitation of Au nanoparticle on the TiO2 surface injects one electron into the CB of TiO2. 
A similar mechanism of charge separation using visible light can occur when a dye is adsorbed on the TiO2 surface, this being the basis of the operation of dye-sensitized solar cells.24,61–64 In order to increase the efficiency of dye sensitization, orbital overlap between the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital of the dye and the conduction band of the semiconductor must occur and this is generally better achieved if the dye is strongly anchored to the surface of the semiconductor. In general, the presence of acid groups, particularly carboxylic acids, is very appropriate to promote the strong binding between the dye and the TiO2 particles.
2.2 Best practices for evaluation of photocatalytic activity in CO2 reduction
Most of the work in the literature has determined the photocatalytic activity of semiconductors for CO2 reduction in liquid H2O.9,13 One of the problems associated with this methodology is that the standard reduction potential of H2O to form H2 is considerably lower (Eored = 0 V) than the standard reduction potential of CO2 to form CO2− (Eored = −1.9 V).9 Therefore, from a thermodynamic point of view it should be generally more favorable to reduce H2O than CO2. Thus, if CO2 reduction is carried out in H2O, simultaneous determination of the volume of H2 evolved should be performed and discussed as a competitive side reaction. In this way, if reduction of CO2 is not accompanied by H2 generation, then, this would be a good indication that H2O is not competing with CO2 for the quenching of electrons from the semiconductor. However, if reduction of CO2 is accompanied by the generation of a large quantity of H2, as it should always be the case on the basis of thermodynamic considerations, then, the photocatalytic activity of the material should be reevaluated under other conditions, preferably in the absence of liquid H2O.
Another aspect to be considered when performing the photocatalytic CO2 reduction in liquid water is the pH of the aqueous solution. Not infrequently, photocatalytic CO2 reduction is carried out under basic pH values in order to increase CO2 solubility in H2O. However, under these conditions carbonate and bicarbonate are formed and these species are more difficult to be reduced than CO2 itself, therefore increasing the difficulty of the process. In addition, carbonate and bicarbonate are good hole quenchers and they undergo oxidation rather than reduction. In contrast, decreasing the pH value and higher proton concentrations might decrease the theoretical reduction potential of CO2 by assisting the electron transfer to CO2 with protonation of the negative species. However, the possibility that a higher proton concentration increases the production of H2 gas faster than the reduction of CO2 should also be considered and evaluated.
The majority of the studies in the literature are carried out in liquid H2O as the reaction medium. However, for the reasons commented above it could be interesting to check other solvents that are more difficult to reduce than H2O. In this context, and considering that ethanol and other alcohols are good solvents for CO2 and are also better electron donors than H2O, the paucity of studies on reactions in these media is surprising. In addition, alcohols and CH3OH also allow the presence of Brönsted acids that could favor the thermodynamics of the reduction.
In general, there are not much data about the mass balances of CO2 consumption or detailed analysis of the product distribution including oxalic and formic acids or CH4 and CO. The use of 13C and 18O labeled CO2 can help to complete mass balances and determine the scrambling between CO2 and the organic compound.65,66 In the context of the ability of TiO2 to degrade and mineralize organic compounds, particularly CH3OH to CO2,31 it is interesting to comment that probably there is a maximum CH3OH concentration, as a photoproduct, that can be in equilibrium with CO2 (Scheme 3). The situation has some similarity with the overall water splitting where the simultaneous formation of hydrogen and oxygen reaches a maximum under the reaction conditions, due to their recombination in the presence of platinum or other metals in the photocatalyst to re-form water.

2.3 Reaction mechanism
Microporous silicates containing isolated Ti atoms in the framework (TS1, Ti-MCM-41 and Ti-SBA-15 among others) are efficient photocatalysts for the UV-light promoted reduction of CO2.67 The mechanism of photocatalytic CO2 reduction on Ti-silicates has been addressed by monitoring the FT-IR spectra of the solid photocatalyst.66 The changes in the CO region are compatible with the formation of HCOOH adsorbed on the surface as the primary product. Subsequent irradiation of HCOOH gives rise to CO that migrates to the gas phase. In turn, CH3OH, acting as a sacrificial electron donor, is converted to HCHO that disproportionates to methyl formate (Tishchenko reaction) (Scheme 4).66

While the key point of the previous study was the detection of HCOOH as the primary product, the use of CH3OH as a sacrificial donor and the presumable formation of HCHO from CH3OH may mask part of the reaction intermediates formed in the photocatalytic CO2 reduction by H2O. In this regard, a complementary mechanistic study of hydrocarbon formation using Ti-SBA-15 as the photocatalyst has arrived at the conclusion that the main source of CH4, C2H4 and C2H6 (observed in this case as products) is HCHO rather than HCOOH or CH3OH.68 This conclusion has been reached by studying the photocatalytic activity for hydrocarbon formation starting from formic acid, HCHO or CH3OH (Table 1).68

The apparent contradiction between these two mechanistic studies, i.e. the formation of hydrocarbons and the intermediacy of HCOOH66 or HCHO68 can arise from the use of CH3OH or H2O as the sacrificial electron donor.
In any case, one issue of interest is to assess whether or not the reaction mechanism in titanium silicates is different or not from the reaction pathway occurring on TiO2 that is the most widely employed photocatalyst. In this regard, in situ spectroscopic studies using TiO2 will be very informative to complement mechanistic studies with other materials.
Using the electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) technique and titania as the photocatalyst, a mechanistic study aimed at determining the role of H2O and carbonates in the photocatalytic transformation of CO2 to CH4 has been reported.69 It should be considered that EPR is biased towards radical mechanisms, since this is the type of species that are detectable and may not give a complete picture of all the reaction pathways and intermediates involved. Nevertheless, the formation of hydrogen atoms, hydroxyl radicals and CO3˙− radical anion was detected.69 This study based on EPR concluded that H2O may play three roles, some of them negative, in the photocatalytic CO2 reduction, i.e., (1) stabilization of charges preventing electron–hole recombination, (2) electron donor, quenching photogenerated holes and giving HO˙ radicals and (3) as an electron acceptor competing with CO2 and forming H atoms from surface bound protons. Carbonates and bicarbonates formed upon dissolving CO2 in basic water compete with H2O for the photogenerated holes and can act as efficient hole scavengers. All these data are compatible with a concerted two electron, one proton transfer (see eqn (1)) to adsorbed CO2 molecules on the TiO2 surface as indicated in Scheme 5.69 CO2 + 2e− + H+ → HCOO−(1)

3. Pure TiO2 as the photocatalyst
In the majority of the photocatalytic reactions for environmental remediation and pollutant degradation, TiO2 is the best performing semiconductor when it is irradiated with photons of wavelength shorter than 380 nm. In addition to high efficiency, pure TiO2 in the anatase form also enjoys high stability and durability with a low tendency to undergo deactivation and photocorrosion. Other advantages of TiO2 are the lack of the toxicity and affordability. In the present case of photocatalytic CO2 reduction, particularly considering the lack of a reliable ranking of photocatalyst activity, the efficiency of pure TiO2 in its anatase form under UV irradiation should be also the reference to which other photocatalysts have to be compared.
A problem in employing TiO2 as the photocatalyst for CO2 reduction with UV light is, however, the lack of selectivity in the product distribution. Thus, although presumably CO2 conversion using TiO2 under UV light should be among the highest of all semiconductors, the product distribution is complex and includes CH4, CH3OH, CO, H2 and HCOOH and therefore the applicability of this process, even considering the use of UV light, is very limited. In addition to higher activity (particularly under visible light irradiation) it is necessary to control the selectivity of the photocatalytic process to have some chance of applicability for the photocatalytic production of solar fuels.
In this regard it is worthy to comment that the level of understanding of the mechanistic pathways leading to the products is very poor at the present. One possibility that can be suggested is that there are two alternative routes depending on whether or not CO2 hydrogenation steps are faster or slower than the CO2 deoxygenation paths. In this simple view, formic acid, HCHO and finally CH3OH will be formed if hydrogen addition to CO2 is the prevalent photocatalytic route. On the other hand, CO and CH4 (probably through elemental carbon as the intermediate) will be derived from those paths in which loss of oxygen atoms occurs faster than hydrogen addition.
In the following paragraphs, we will summarize briefly the reported work on photocatalytic CO2 reduction using various forms of pure TiO2 under UV light, while Table 2 compiles conditions and products reported using the various TiO2 photocatalysts.

Kocí and co-workers70 studied the effect of TiO2 particle size in the range from 4.5 to 29 nm as the photocatalyst. The highest CH4 (9.5 μmol g−1 catalyst) and CH3OH (1.15 μmol g−1 catalyst) yield was observed for a sample of titania with particle size of 14 nm, while increasing or decreasing the particle size led to lower yields. These results were explained as arising from the balance between two opposite parameters i.e. higher surface area favoring the activity of small nanoparticles, and band gap energy increase disfavoring the activity for small nanoparticles. Since it is unlikely to observe variations in the band gap for TiO2 nanoparticles larger than a few nanometers, the reasons why the sample with 14 nm is more active than the one with the smallest particle size remain unclear.
In another study, cylindrical TiO2 pellets with 4 mm diameter were used as the photocatalyst for CO2 reduction to CH4 using 254 and 365 nm lamps.71 The CH4 yield by irradiation of a photocatalyst suspension is comparatively better than that obtained from immobilized catalysts through anchoring the titanium oxide catalyst on a porous Vycor glass (60 ppm).112 This should be related to easier mass transfer and lower diffusion limitations in the pellets.
The photocatalytic reduction of CO2 at high pressure was reported using TiO2 suspensions in H2O and caustic solutions at 20 °C.72 In aqueous medium, analysis of the gas phase reveals the formation of CH4 whose concentration increases gradually with pressure up to 24.7 atm, while the liquid phase contains CH3OH (reaching a maximum of 9.9 atm) and some HCOOH formed at 24.7 atm. The same experiments at 24.7 atm in 0.2 M NaOH lead to the formation of acetaldehyde and ethanol. An increase in CO2 pressure significantly accelerates CO2 reduction in both water and caustic solution.
Photoreduction of CO2 using isopropanol solution as a positive hole scavenger in the presence of TiO2 has been reported at 20 °C.73 The formation of CH4 decreased from 1.2 to 0.62 μmol g−1 catalyst when the concentration of isopropanol increased from 1 to 3 M at 5 h. This optimal concentration of isopropanol suggests that this compound, or the product derived from it (acetone), competes with CO2 as the electron acceptor. In contrast, when the pressure of CO2 was increased from 2.0 to 27.6 atm the formation of CH4 gradually increased. Again, this influence of product distribution with pressure remains unexplained and deserves further studies to gain a better understanding of the reactions that take place.
The nature of the solvent determines the product selectivity during photoreduction of CO2 using TiO2. In this regard, Kaneco and co-workers reported photocatalytic reduction of CO2 using TiO2 powders in liquid CO2 medium working with light of wavelengths above 340 nm.74 The addition of H2O as the hydrogen donor was performed at the end of the irradiation time. The influence of temperature and pressure was also studied for 30 h illumination using TiO2 powders, and it was seen that the yield of HCOOH was almost constant and not affected either by temperature (0 to 25 °C) or pressure (49.3 to 79.0 atm). Interestingly, no gaseous photoreduced products were observed under these conditions. The production of HCOOH almost linearly increased with the amount of TiO2 in the photoreactor.
Among the efforts made to improve the CO2 photoconversion, we can highlight the use of liquid or supercritical CO275 in which the CO2 concentration is substantially higher than in an aqueous solution. The influence of different hydrogen donors namely CH3OH, ethanol, isopropanol and phosphoric acid, added at the end of the irradiation of supercritical fluid CO2, was studied in order to optimize the production of HCOOH. The addition of phosphoric acid in the supercritical fluid increased the yield of HCOOH. The beneficial influence of phosphoric acid can be understood considering that the protons decrease the potential of CO2 reduction. It was found that photoreduction of CO2 was significantly more efficient in supercritical CO2 than in aqueous CO2 solution.113
4. Enhancement of the photocatalytic activity by control of TiO2 particle morphology
Generally the reference material for the photocatalytic application of TiO2 is P25 from Degussa which, in addition to containing some percentage of rutile, is constituted by nanoparticles of about 30 nm diameter. Several studies have shown that the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 can be increased with respect to this standard by varying the morphology of the individual crystallites forming the solid. For instance, decreasing the particle size without effecting an increase in the band gap (arising from the operation of quantum size effects starting from nanoparticles of around 1 nm) can enhance the photocatalytic efficiency at least because the external surface area has increased.
Commercial colloidal TiO2 (Degussa) aggregates in suspension, reducing the surface area and compromising the photoreaction due to scattering effects.75,114 In order to overcome these problems, TiO2 nanoparticles have been dispersed uniformly over the commercial ionomer Nafion membrane and the composite used as the photocatalyst for CO2 reduction at 136 atm.76 Significantly more efficient photoreduction of CO2 was observed with the use of TiO2 dispersed over a single Nafion film than with suspended Degussa TiO2.76
Besides decrease in particle size, another physical approach to enhance the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 has been the use of titania in the form of nanotubes and nanorods. In these materials it appears that electron transport along the long axes of the crystallite is very fast and charge separation is favored due to this high electron mobility. TiO2 nanotubes and nanorods can be formed in various ways. The simplest method for the synthesis of nanorods is from TiO2 nanoparticles by digestion at high temperatures under strong alkali conditions. Nanotubes can be obtained from layered titanates as starting precursors that are subsequently annealed under solvothermal conditions. Nanorods and nanotubes very often exhibit enhanced photocatalytic activity with respect to P25 as the standard.
One further development of the use of TiO2 with nanotube or nanorod morphology has been the alignment at macroscopic distances of these nano-objects. This ordering can serve also to trap light inside the material not only by scattering but also by the so-called “crystal photonic” effect that appears when the wavelength of the photon matches the distances between the TiO2 rods and particles.
4.1 Titania supported on aluminosilicates
The problem with the strategy based on preparation of small nanoparticles is their tendency to grow that has to be avoided by embedding nanoparticles in a porous matrix of appropriate pore dimension. In this context, porous aluminosilicates have been among the preferred hosts to stabilize TiO2 nanoparticles since there are reliable procedures for the preparation of crystalline and amorphous micro- and mesoporous silicas that expand from zeolites to structured materials such as MCM-41.41,78,115–123
In this regard, highly dispersed titanium oxide photocatalysts have been prepared within the pores of zeolite cavities by impregnation or ion-exchange and the resulting material tested for the photocatalytic reduction (λ > 280 nm) of CO2 with H2O vapor to produce CH4 and CH3OH at 55 °C.77 Titanium oxide exchanged on Y zeolites exhibited high reactivity and selectivity for the formation of CH3OH while CH4 was found to be the major product using bulk TiO2 as well as titanium oxide impregnated on Y zeolite (Fig. 1).77 This change in product selectivity is surprising and needs to be understood.

Adapted from ref. 77. 
In addition, micro- and mesoporous titanosilicates have also been tested for photoreduction of CO2. The list of materials includes TS-1, Ti-MCM-41, Ti-MCM-48 and Pt-Ti-MCM-48.77 It was found that Ti-MCM-48 exhibits the highest reactivity and selectivity in the series for the formation of CH3OH. This high activity may be explained as due to the combined contribution of a high dispersion of titanium oxide particles, large pore size of the MCM-48 host and its tridirectional channel structure. Addition of platinum over Ti-MCM-48 resulted in an enhancement of the yield of CH4 by decreasing the yield of CH3OH. Similar studies were performed by the same authors using Ti-MCM-41 as the mesoporous catalyst124 for photocatalytic reduction of CO2 with H2O obtaining identical results.77
Titanium beta-zeolites (Ti-β) having hydrophobic or hydrophilic properties have been synthesized and used for photocatalytic reduction of CO2 with H2O to produce CH4 and CH3OH.78 Ti-β having hydroxyl groups (Ti-β-(OH)) exhibited five times higher reactivity compared to Ti-β synthesized with fluoride groups (Ti-β-(F)) (Fig. 2). This higher reactivity was attributed to the higher concentration of the charge transfer excited states for Ti-β-(OH) as observed by photoluminescence. It should be, however, commented that photoluminescence intensity may not truly reflect the quantum yields of charge separation since photoluminescence accounts only for the decay of a very minor fraction of the total charge separated state.
 Fig. 2  Yields of CH4 (□) and CH3OH (■) in the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 with H2O at 50 °C on Ti-β (OH), TS-1, Ti-β (F) and TiO2 (P25) catalysts. Adapted from ref. 78. 
In order to increase the selectivity of CH3OH in CO2 photoreduction, FSM-16 catalyst was modified by partial fluorination.78 Although a significant increase in CH3OH selectivity could be observed with the fluorinated catalyst, the CH3OH selectivity was still less than 20%. This is due to the fact that the fluorinated Ti-FSM-16 still exhibits slight hydrophilic properties associated with the presence of hydroxyl groups. Interestingly, Ti-FSM-16 resulted in higher yield of CH4 compared to its partially fluorinated catalyst. Thus, it seems that although fluorination increases CH3OH production probably due to hydrophobicity, hydrophilic zeolites exhibit higher reactivity.
Titanium containing porous silica thin films have been reported as photocatalysts for CO2 photoreduction with H2O vapor79 yielding similar results as reported earlier for titanium containing silica powders.77 It was found that similarly to the previous case on the influence of fluorination, titanium containing porous silica thin films having small amounts of surface hydroxyl groups exhibited the highest selectivity for the formation of CH3OH (Fig. 3). Another parameter that determines the selectivity of CH4 or CH3OH is the ratio between H2O and CO2. When H2O/CO2 is high the selectivity for the formation of CH4 becomes higher.79

4.2 Titania nanotubes
The synthesis of titania nanotubes and their application in dye sensitized solar cells, gas sensors and photocatalysis have been recently reviewed.1 In this aspect, mixed phased materials combining the anatase and rutile crystal phases of TiO2 nanotubes have been reported for CO2 photoreduction under UV and visible light.80 The production rate of CH4 decreased with increasing rutile phase under UV irradiation. However, the rate of formation of CH4 increased with the rutile phase ratio under near visible light (380 nm) or visible light (400 nm). The performance of titania nanotubes for CO2 reduction towards CH4 formation under sunlight irradiation has been enhanced by around tenfold by depositing ultrafine platinum nanoparticles (3.4 nm average particle size).82 In another precedent, titania nanotubes doped with nitrogen containing platinum or copper nanoparticles showed enhanced performance as a sunlight photocatalyst for the conversion of CO2 and H2O vapor to hydrocarbons.81
5. Metal doping
As commented earlier in the introductory section, metal doping, understood as the replacement of a small fraction of Ti atoms by other transition metals, is one of the most studied methodologies to expand the photoresponse of TiO2 materials towards visible light (Scheme 1). In the case of photocatalytic CO2 reduction this strategy of metal doping has also been applied to modify the photoactivity of TiO2 and it has been found to have a strong influence on controlling the product selectivity. Copper doping is the most efficient way to enhance selectivity towards CH3OH production and formation of formic acid derivatives. In contrast, doping with Pd or Pt favors the selectivity towards CH4 and CO. The reasons for and origin of this selectivity are unclear and, moreover, there is a lack of conceptual framework allowing rationalization of selectivity (see Scheme 6 for a simple proposal concerning the product distribution). Theoretical work is much needed in this area to gain understanding on the mechanism of the process and how it becomes influenced by metal doping. If possible, the product distribution should be directed to the selective formation of CH3OH considering the advantages, physical properties of this alcohol and its higher volumetric and mass energy content compared to other possible products.
 Scheme 6  Proposal of two alternative pathways to rationalize the product distribution in the photocatalytic CO2 reduction. 
One aspect that has not been considered with the necessary attention is to provide convincing characterization data providing the isomorphic framework titanium substitution by other metals and to document reliable protocols for the preparation of metal doped TiO2. Concerning characterization, chemical analysis showing only the presence of Cu, Pd or Pt or other metals is not sufficient to prove metal doping since phase segregation can occur and the dopant can be present in a different domain. Also, diffuse reflectance spectroscopy showing a shift in the absorption band of pure TiO2 is an indirect evidence for metal doping and is insufficient to prove the presence of the dopant in the TiO2 framework.
Most of the materials in which metal doping has been claimed exhibit some kind of photoresponse different from pure TiO2, but again this is a weak evidence for the presence of metal dopants in the TiO2 framework. In addition, since all the doping metals can undergo photocorrosion during long time operation of the photocatalyst, characterization of the fresh materials is not sufficient and it is always necessary to provide further characterization after a long operation time of the photocatalyst to show that no changes have occurred.
Perhaps the best techniques to prove incorporation of the doping metal in the lattice is, as in the case of any other solid phase, extended X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy (EXAFS) or X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES), but unfortunately this information is not being provided for those metal doped TiO2 for which photocatalytic activity for CO2 reduction has been reported. With these spectroscopic techniques, the coordination sphere, the bond distances of first and second coordination spheres and average coordination numbers can be experimentally determined for the dopant metal and they should match with the octahedral oxygen coordination and presence of titania expected for the metals incorporated in the anatase lattice.
Besides firm characterization of fresh and long term used metal doped TiO2, another key issue in this area is to develop reliable doping procedures. Since TiO2 is a very stable and robust metal oxide, it is extremely difficult to be modified once the lattice has been formed and is likely that any doping of anatase will affect only the surface of the particles. The most convenient sol–gel synthesis, in which precursors of TiO2 having a single Ti atom such as titanium tetraisopropoxide are mixed with some precursors of other metals, does not guarantee that the doping metal becomes incorporated into the anatase framework, especially because annealing at 500 °C necessary to obtain crystalline phases can produce the migration of the dopant outside the framework during TiO2 crystallization from amorphous phases.
In the following paragraphs we will comment on the results achieved using various metal-doped titania starting from Cu-doped TiO2 that is, probably, the most studied photocatalyst for CO2 reduction. The work with Cu-doped TiO2 has been subdivided depending on the major product characterized in the process.
Photoreduction of CO2 has been reported using a Cu-doped TiO2 sample as the photocatalyst prepared by the sol–gel method that is twice more efficient than copper deposited over P25 obtained by incipient wetness to produce CH3OH.83 CH4, HCOOH and other hydrocarbons were not detected using Cu-doped TiO2. Blank controls using TiO2 and Degussa P25 showed much lower CH3OH yield proving experimentally the positive role of Cu-doping. One possible explanation is that the maximum concentration of CH3OH is limited by a stationary state in which its formation from CO2 is compensated by its degradation. Thus, CH3OH stability tests under the photoreaction conditions and operation under continuous removal of formed CH3OH would be of interest to clarify the maximum productivity of the system. The maximum CH3OH yield was achieved for a Cu-doped TiO2 prepared by the sol–gel method using CuCl2 as the precursor added at 1 h, after the start of gelification of TiO2 without any hydrogen reduction treatment.84,85
This photocatalyst gives probably the highest value of CH3OH production under UV light irradiation among all the photocatalysts reported. The high activity of this catalyst was attributed to the good dispersion of predominant Cu(I) species with 25% of total copper loading located on the outermost surface of TiO2 particles as evidenced by XPS, XRD and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). A similar protocol has been applied to disperse silver over titania but the CH3OH yield was much lower than for Cu-doped TiO2.
Photoreduction of CO2 to CH3OH by Cu-doped TiO2 was also performed using an optical fiber photoreactor.86,87 It appears that there is an optimal copper loading indicating that there are positive and negative effects associated with the presence of copper in the photocatalyst.
It has been reported that the CH3OH yield was altered by the initial oxidation state of copper species (Cu0, CuI, CuII) present over titania.88 Productivity towards CH3OH increases in the order Cu–TiO2 < Cu2O–TiO2 < CuO–TiO2.88 The optimal amount of CuO on TiO2 (3 wt%) results in a high yield of CH3OH (Fig. 4).

A series of mesoporous composites having TiO2 nanoparticles embedded inside the mesoporous channels of SBA-15 (TiO2–SBA-15 and Cu–TiO2–SBA-15) have been prepared and used as photocatalysts for the photoreduction of CO2 to CH3OH.89 45 wt% TiO2–SBA-15 showed the optimum value for the highest CH3OH production for the photoreduction of CO2 in H2O that is about three times higher than the rate of commercial TiO2 (Fig. 5). The loading of copper on titania somewhat increases the catalytic activity for photoreduction of CO2. This increase of the photocatalytic activity introduced by copper is, however, relatively minor.

Photoreduction of CO2 is very much influenced by the reaction parameters, catalyst preparation and solvent used. Besides H2O, one possibility is to use CH3OH as a solvent and reductant due to its strong reducibility and the high solubility of CO2.90 Under these conditions, the origin of certain C-1 products, either from CO2 or other sources, should be checked. In this respect, CuO–TiO2 catalysts were prepared using cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) as a template and tested for the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 under UV light. The maximum yield of methyl formate was obtained with 1 wt% CuO–TiO2 (Fig. 6). Calcination temperature of the Cu-doped TiO2 synthesized by the sol–gel method also has a strong influence in determining the efficiency of titania for CO2 photoreduction. This effect of calcination temperature is not surprising since highly crystalline anatase samples are known to be more active than amorphous titania, but high crystallization temperatures (above 500 °C) can lead to a partial phase change from anatase to rutile and this last crystal phase is photochemically much less active than anatase.
 Fig. 6  Formation rate of methyl formate as a function of the weight percentage of copper oxide on titania. Adapted from ref. 90. 
The cooperative effect of the CuO–TiO2 heterostructure has been demonstrated by a reference experiment comparing the photocatalytic activity with a mixture of CuO and TiO2 with the same ratio as the Cu-doped TiO2, which resulted in the same catalytic activity as that of pure TiO2. These data were taken as an evidence for the inability of CuO to participate in the photoreduction of CO2. However, it could have been more convenient to check the photocatalytic activity of pure CuO independently to confirm this proposal.
Li and co-workers have reported the photocatalytic activity for CO2 reduction of a mesoporous silica containing copper supported over titania observing CO as the main product.91 It has to be noted here that while no CH4 was produced by TiO2–SiO2, the addition of copper on TiO2–SiO2 resulted in the formation of CH4 as well as a two-fold increase in the production of CO. This change in product selectivity due to the presence of copper remains to be rationalized. As shown in Fig. 7 the CO and CH4 production rate decreased during the course of the reaction.91 Reuse of the catalyst was carried out observing again the production of CO and CH4, but with a lower efficiency than with the fresh catalyst. Catalyst regeneration by air was explained assuming the desorption of some volatile by-products from the TiO2 surface by purging the solid with air. It would have been convenient to determine the amount and composition of these volatile poisons since they may also be valuable from the point of view of CO2 transformation. Deactivation of the catalyst was attributed to the reduction of CuI to Cu0.91 It is well documented in the literature that Cu0 is less active than CuI for the photoreduction of CO2 and, therefore, activity decay could be due to the variation in the oxidation state of copper.84,87
 Fig. 7  Time dependence on the production rates of CO (◆) and CH4 (□) using 0.5 wt% Cu2O–TiO2–SiO2. Adapted from ref. 91. 
A study on the photoreduction of CO2 using nanostructured copper doped titania–silica (Cu–TiO2–SiO2) composites as the catalyst92 has shown that the optimum molar percentages of TiO2 and Cu were 2 and 0.01 wt%, respectively. Appropriate controls on the photocatalytic activity of various copper oxides or even copper oxides supported or grafted on silicas have been of interest. It could be that copper oxide alone or that embedded in silica is able to act as a photocatalyst for CO2 photoreduction. At least, the formation of CH4 appears to be correlated with this metal oxide.
As discussed above, inert mesoporous matrices can contribute to enhancing the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 by dispersion of copper over titania particles. A recent study further exemplifies this methodology.93 Thus, Cu–TiO2 supported on a 5 Å molecular sieve (MS) was prepared by impregnation and solid-state dispersion methods. These solids have been used for photoreduction of CO2 in pure and basic H2O, to give oxalic acid as the major product (Fig. 8).93 The highest yield of oxalic acid was observed using 2 wt% Cu–TiO2 on MS composites as a photocatalyst using 0.2 M NaOH. Trace amounts of CH4, low amounts of CH3OH and acetic acid were observed when the reaction was carried out in basic water. A remarkable decrease in the yield of CH3OH from 600 to 10 μmol g−1 catalyst is observed when the wavelength is shifted from 254 to 365 nm, respectively.84 This influence of wavelength upon excitation on the TiO2 band gap transition is not well understood and would require determination of the complete photoresponse spectrum to rationalize its origin.

Reaction conditions: CO2 saturated solution = 150 ml, catalyst 3 g L−1, light source = UV light (365 nm), 4 h. Adapted from ref. 93. 
Besides copper, other transition metals have also been used as TiO2 dopants to effect the photocatalytic CO2 reduction. A series of Y doped titania nanoparticles were synthesized by the sol–gel method and used as the photocatalyst for the CO2 reduction.94 Out of the various weight percentages of Y doped on titania nanoparticles, 0.1 wt% Y–TiO2 showed the highest photocatalytic activity resulting in the formation of HCHO. This result of Y-doped titania is interesting, considering that HCHO is claimed to be an intermediate in several CO2 reduction mechanisms, but is rarely detectable.
Silver doped crystalline titania (Ag–TiO2) prepared by the sol–gel method has been reported recently for CO2 reduction to CH4 and CH3OH as main products using a wavelength of 254 or 365 nm.95 Increasing the silver content on titania from 0 to 5.2 wt% gradually increased the total amount of CH4 and CH3OH about 2.5 times at 254 nm. However, at 365 nm the yields remain almost unaltered. It was observed that silver doping on titania increases the specific surface area, reduces the band gap energy to promote the photocatalytic activity and is proposed to provoke a decrease in the electron–hole recombination rate by acting as electron traps.125,126
TiO2 doped with carbon at different weight ratios of C and TiO2 has been prepared by immersion in citric acid as the dopant followed by calcination. These C-doped TiO2 samples were used for photocatalytic reduction of CO2 towards HCOOH under UV-Vis light.96 Out of the various ratios between C and TiO2, C–TiO2 (3:1) prepared at 600 °C exhibited the highest yield towards HCOOH that is about 1.5 times higher than the value of pure TiO2 (P-25).
Iodide doped TiO2 nanoparticles have been synthesized by a hydrothermal method and tested towards photoreduction of CO2 to CO under visible light.97 Thus, under visible light 10 wt% I–TiO2 prepared by annealing at 375 °C showed the highest production of CO. In contrast, under UV-Vis irradiation 5 wt% I–TiO2 prepared at 375 °C showed lower activity than pure TiO2. On the other hand, N or S doped TiO2 showed superior photoreduction activity than pure TiO2 under visible light irradiation but their similar or even lower catalytic activity in the UV region has also been reported.13,127
Nitrogen and nickel co-doped nanotitania (N–Ni–TiO2) photocatalyst has been prepared by the sol–gel method and tested for the production of CH3OH at three different wavelengths (254, 365 and 400–780 nm).98 The series of photocatalysts tested and a summary of the results are listed in Table 3. When comparing the results of the various photocatalysts, it has to be noted that nitrogen doped titania contains more rutile phase than pure titania. Using pure titania, the yield of CH3OH decreased as the irradiation wavelength increases from 254, 365 to 400–780 nm. A similar influence of the irradiation wavelength has been also observed using 4 wt% N–TiO2, 6 wt% Ni–TiO2 and 4 wt% N–6 wt% Ni–TiO2 as catalysts. However, it is interesting to note that a synergism between Ni and N over nanotitania was noted when the reaction was performed at 365 and 400–780 nm.

6. Photosensitization
Development of solar fuels128,129 from CO2 requires that the photocatalytic CO2 reduction is carried out using natural sunlight. This light source contains less than 5% of UV radiation and about 50% of visible light. For this reason, although many previous works were aimed at showing the possibility of the photocatalytic reduction and determination of the optimal operation conditions, the real potential applications of the photocatalytic CO2 reduction must derive from visible light photocatalysis. Traditionally the visible light photoactivity is achieved by starting from UV-light photocatalysts and performing some doping or structural modifications to expand the response of the material to the visible region. The present section summarizes the work carried out with titanium containing photocatalysts that are able to respond to excitation with visible light.
Besides doping in which metallic or non-metallic elements have been introduced into the lattice of TiO2, another alternative to enhance the photoresponse, particularly with the visible light, of TiO2 is to deposit on the surface of preformed TiO2 some species that can harvest photons and use the energy of these photons to inject electrons into the conduction band of TiO2. The key point of this strategy is the existence of a surface acting as a Schottky barrier separating electrons (on the TiO2 conduction band) from holes (on the light harvesting photosensitizer).
The most widely studied light harvesters that have been exploited for the operation of solar cells are dyes that can be organic compounds or metal complexes with high extinction coefficients for the absorption bands. The disadvantage of this approach is the low stability of the organic component that tends to degrade quickly under photocatalytic conditions. One alternative to avoid labile dyes has been the use of inorganic light harvester particles. In this context, quantum dots, that can be considered by themselves narrow band gap semiconductors, have been used to sensitize TiO2.
A more recent approach, termed as plasmon photocatalysis, has been the use of noble metals having surface plasmon bands such as Au or Ag to photosensitize TiO2. The photocatalytic stability of these noble metals depends on their redox potential and for this reason Au appears as the most promising one due to the absence of photocorrosion. Even though the price of noble metals is high, the fact that only very low loadings (around 1 wt% or below) are needed, together with the fact that they are durable materials, justifies their use.
6.1 Quantum dots
To achieve visible light photoresponse, a combination of titania based catalysts with either metal nanoparticles (i.e. gold)130 or quantum dots,99 that can act as an antenna absorbing visible light and transferring the energy to the semiconductor, has been tested for the photocatalytic reduction of CO2. In this context, CdSe deposited on Pt–TiO2 has been prepared and its photocatalytic activity towards photoreduction of CO2 in the presence of visible light studied.99 While the use of CdSe–Pt–TiO2 resulted in the formation of CH4, CH3OH, accompanied by trace amounts of H2 and CO, Pt–TiO2 showed no photoconversion products. Replacement of platinum with iron resulted in H2 production suggesting that water splitting is the only photoreaction taking place.
In order to further investigate the efficiency of quantum dots in CO2 photoreduction, Wang and co-workers have prepared different particle sizes of PbS quantum dots deposited over Cu–TiO2 to form heterostructured photocatalysts for CO2 photoreduction under visible light.100 PbS quantum dots were prepared with the sizes of 3, 4 and 5 nm to act as sensitizers of Cu–TiO2. Deposition of PbS over Cu–TiO2 increases the photocatalytic activity of Cu–TiO2 at least three times. A limitation of using sulfides in photocatalysis is, however, photocorrosion leading to a short lifetime of the photocatalyst. Thus, studies on durability and material stability are necessary to have an idea of the potential of this methodology.
6.2 Metal nanoparticles supported on titania as photocatalysts
Palladium metal over TiO2 was prepared by the photochemical deposition method and the resulting material used for the photocatalytic reduction of CO2.101 Introducing palladium (1 wt%) over titania modified the product distribution from CO for TiO2 to CH4 as the major product with small amounts of CO and C2H6 for Pd–TiO2. It was observed that the photocatalytic activity of Pd–TiO2 was drastically reduced in the reuse. This may be explained from the fact that palladium was oxidized to palladium oxide during the operation of the photocatalyst as evidenced from XPS analysis.
Photocatalytic reduction of CO2 has been performed also using platinum deposited by the incipient wetness impregnation method on TiO2 nanoparticles (TiO2-NP) and TiO2 nanotubes (TiO2-NT).102 An optimal platinum loading to achieve the highest activity was identified, resulting in a high yield of CH4, with a H2O/CO2 molar ratio of 0.02 at 50 °C. Both Pt deposited on nanoparticles or nanotubes show higher CH4 yield when the temperature rose from 50 to 70 °C. The influence on CH4 formation of the molar ratio between H2O and CO2 was studied at 55 °C and it was observed that the CH4 yield increases with the increase of H2O/CO2 ratio when Pt is deposited on nanotubes but the ratio does not have any influence when Pt is deposited on TiO2 nanoparticles (Fig. 9). Although the reasons for this opposite behavior have not been analysed yet, these results show the influence that the morphology of TiO2 has on its photocatalytic activity.131,132
 Fig. 9  Effect of H2O/CO2 molar ratio on CH4 yield using 0.12 wt% Pt–TiO2-NP (△) and 0.15 wt% Pt–TiO2-NT (○) photocatalysts at 55 °C under UV irradiation. Photolysis time 17 h. Adapted from ref. 102. 
In this regard, a recent publication has shown that anatase TiO2 nanorods loaded with platinum are more efficient than the analogous P25 sample for the photocatalytic CO2 reduction to CH4 in the presence of H2O vapor.103 Although the initial reaction rates for the TiO2 nanorods and P25 are not that different, it is the long term photoactivity of TiO2 nanorods which is affected with respect to P25. It was proposed that this enhancement can be due to the preferential exposure of [0, 1, 0] facets present in the nanorods.
An AgBr–TiO2 photocatalyst was prepared by the deposition–precipitation method in the presence of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) and its photocatalytic activity tested for the photoreduction of CO2 to hydrocarbons under visible light.104 The maximum yield of CH4, CH3OH, ethanol and CO in aqueous solutions at pH 8.5 under visible light was achieved using 23.2 wt% AgBr–TiO2 calcined at 500 °C. The AgBr–TiO2 catalyst was used five times without much decrease in the product yields. Further, XRD results showed that AgBr–TiO2 does not change after repeated photoreduction experiments indicating that AgBr nanoparticles are still well dispersed on TiO2 and are stable maintaining their photocatalytic activity. Considering the tendency of Ag to undergo oxidation to Ag+ and leaching under photocatalysis operation using TiO2, these stability tests are crucial to gain understanding of the performance of this type of materials.
In contrast to the visible light photoactivity of AgBr–TiO2, deposition of Ag metal on TiO2 does not render a material with visible light photoactivity. Thus, Kocí and co-workers have reported the effect of silver doping on TiO2 for the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 under UV and visible irradiation.133 Silver enriched TiO2 powders were prepared by a controlled sol–gel process in reverse micelles. Out of the various weight percentages of silver, 7 wt% Ag–TiO2 showed the highest product yields in the order H2 > CH4 > CH3OH ≥ CO.133 In addition, the effect of wavelength on the photolysis was studied observing that shifting the wavelength from 254 to 400 nm results in the Ag–TiO2 photocatalyst becoming almost inactive for the production of CH4 and CH3OH.105
TiO2 nanoparticles embedded on the hydrophilic cavities of Nafion membrane films were coated with silver via in situ photoreduction of Ag+ salts134 and tested for CO2 photoreduction.106 The use of four stack films enhances the photoreduction of CO2 by a factor of three compared to the activity of a film with one single Nafion sheet under the same reaction conditions. The concentration of silver has an optimal value, decreasing the conversion of CO2 when the Ag loading is lower or higher than the optimum. The catalyst was reused two times without large changes in the product yields.106 One of the advantages of this photocatalytic system is that silver may be removed from the TiO2 nanoparticles in the Nafion membrane by immersing the film in concentrated HNO3 solution in which both the TiO2 nanoparticles and the Nafion films remain stable. It was also demonstrated that TiO2 nanoparticles in the same film could be coated with the silver again via photodeposition and that the catalytic activity for CO2 conversion of this reconstructed photocatalyst was also comparable with those of original Nafion films with silver coated TiO2 nanoparticles.
6.3 Dye supported TiO2 based photocatalysts
There are some reviews in the literature describing the use of molecular complexes as homogeneous photocatalysts for the visible light promoted photoreduction of CO2.3,5,7,10 In addition, dyes adsorbed on TiO2 have also been used for CO2 photoreduction. In this context, Wu and Nguyen have used an optical fiber reactor for the CO2 photoreduction with H2O under UVA artificial light and concentrated natural sunlight to obtain ethylene and CH4 as photoreduced products.135 Metal doped TiO2 catalysts in combination with ruthenium(II) (2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylate)2-(NCS)2 (N3 dye) as the sensitizer has been reported for the photoreduction of CO2 under artificial light and concentrated natural light using glass and optical fiber as supports.107 Adding N3 dye to Cu (0.5 wt%)–Fe (0.5 wt%)–TiO2 coated on a glass plate as the support resulted in the enhancement of CH4 production by 2.46 fold, while with the optical fiber as the support the production rate of ethylene as well as CH4 was slightly reduced.107,136 This observation may be explained by the fact that the light in the TiO2 matrix scattered before it reached the N3 dye coated on the optical fiber.
6.4 Supported phthalocyanine derived photocatalysts
Phthalocyanines (Pc) are a class of macrocyclic nitrogenated compounds which have received considerable attention as dyes and pigments due to their potential applications in various fields.62,137–140 Among their unique properties, these materials exhibit excellent semiconductivity, photoconductivity, chemical stability and optical absorption in the UV-Vis region.141,142 It has been established that anchoring Pcs to nanocrystalline TiO2 enables ultrafast injection of electrons from the excited state of Pc into the conduction band of semiconductors. In this regard, ZnPc complexes have been adsorbed on TiO2 using different procedures such as impregnation, sol–gel and in situ chemical synthesis and the photocatalytic activity of the resulting ZnPc–TiO2 has been tested for CO2 reduction.108 The highest yields of HCOOH, CO and CH4 were obtained using ZnPc–TiO2 prepared by the in situ method. Depositing ZnPc on commercial titania resulted in lower yields of HCOOH, CO and CH4 compared to those materials in which TiO2 was obtained by the sol–gel synthesis.
Zhao and co-workers have prepared CoPc–TiO2 nanocomposites by in situ annulation of 1,2-dicyanobenzene on the surface of TiO2 with Co2+ as a template.109 Comparison of the yields of HCOOH, CH3OH and HCHO between CoPc–TiO2 prepared by the in situ method and a physical mixture of CoPc with TiO2 shows that the former catalyst exhibited higher yield. In contrast, TiO2 is significantly less active. Replacing Co with Zn or Ni did not improve the photoreduction of CO2 under the studied experimental conditions.
After optimization of conditions to achieve the highest photocatalytic activity using CoCl2 as the precursor for the preparation of CoPc, the same authors have extended the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 using titania prepared by a sol–gel method as a support of CoPc.110 The main objective of this work was to determine the effect of CoPc photosensitization on TiO2 and to compare the activity of CoPc–TiO2 with pure TiO2 (sol–gel) and commercial TiO2. All these catalysts have resulted in the formation of CO, CH4, CH3OH, HCHO and HCOOH. Compared to the commercial TiO2, pure TiO2 exhibits higher photocatalytic activity towards CO2 reduction. CoPc loading on TiO2 was tested and it was found that the highest photocatalytic activity was achieved for 0.5 wt% CoPc–TiO2 (Fig. 10). This higher efficiency could be explained considering that 0.5 wt% of CoPc–TiO2 had smaller crystallite sizes with larger specific surface area (90.74 m2 g−1).

6.5 Graphene oxide and TiO2 based photocatalyst
While graphene is the material with the fastest electron mobility and high electrical conductivity,143,144 it may become a semiconductor upon oxidation. Thus, graphene oxide (GO) easily prepared from graphite oxidation followed by exfoliation is considered an organic semiconductor.145,146 While graphene cannot be considered an antenna or a light harvester component due to the lack of a strong absorption in the visible or even in the UV region, its presence can enhance the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 by promoting charge separation.147 Thus, electrons in the CB of TiO2 have been proposed to migrate easily to graphene, the effect of this charge transport being a reduction of charge recombination on TiO2. Electrons on graphene should still have enough reduction potential to promote photochemical reactions.
Recently, GO in combination with TiO2 has been reported as a photocatalyst for CO2 reduction in the presence of H2O.111 The main objective of this report was to show that the photocatalytic activity of GO depends as a key factor on the defect density. It has been demonstrated that GO with low defect density could act as a more efficient photocatalyst than GO samples containing higher defect density. In order to demonstrate these effects, several samples of solvent exfoliated graphene (SEG) have been prepared and separated from thicker platelets by consecutive sedimentation steps.111 SEG was then treated in DMF to obtain solvent reduced GO (SRGO).111 It has been shown that SEG possesses lower defect density than SRGO. Using these GO materials, various materials have been prepared with TiO2 using the co-filtration method. Fig. 11 shows that increasing the TiO2 content on SEG resulted in decreasing the CH4 production rate at 365 nm. In contrast, using visible light as an irradiation source 0.55% of SEG resulted in the enhancement of photoreduction by 7.2 times with respect to P25. Different compositions of TiO2 with SRGO did not show any enhancement in the photoreduction of CO2 either upon irradiation at 365 nm or with visible light compared with respect to P25 lacking graphene oxide. Overall these catalytic data show how by varying the properties of graphene, photocatalysts with very different efficiencies can be obtained.

7. Conclusions and future prospects
It is clear that the interest in solar fuels production will burst in the very near future due to pressure from the society and strategic policies in favor of the development of renewable energy resources. New innovative companies in the renewable energy sector have appeared in the recent years and they will try to exploit profitable processes that can find increasing share in the energy market. This favorable scenario will promote doubtless and increasing scientific research trying to develop economically feasible processes for the conversion of sunlight into chemical energy for transportation. One of the possibilities that seem very advantageous is the conversion of CO2 into CH3OH because this will allow the use of a liquid fuel with many similarities with current fossil fuels or even acting as a source of hydrogen that can represent a smooth transition from the current liquid fossil fuels to the hydrogen technology. Nevertheless, the H2 source for producing CH3OH (or CH4) from CO2 should be obtained from a sustainable source. In this sense, H2O would be an excellent candidate. However, one has to be aware that the process requires activation of two very stable molecules (CO2 and H2O) to make other less stable molecules. This will always lead to high expense of energy. It is not surprising then that the overall conclusion of the above summarized reports is that we are still very far from having the scientific and technological capability to make this transformation. To start with, the reaction mechanism is still unclear and we cannot control or even rationalize the product distribution.
Using photocatalysts based on titania, CH3OH or CH4 can be the prevalent product and we do not have at the present conceptual predictive capability to design a selective material. Even more, the present situation in the field is confusing and it is difficult to compare the performances of different catalysts due to the large variability in the type of light, pH of the solution, CO2 pressure and other experimental conditions that determine the final productivity of the photocatalyst. In any case, and as a general statement, we have to recognize that the current average productivity value is about 100 μmol g−1 h−1 of catalyst with sunlight and there is a need to increase this productivity by orders of magnitude, since the few data reported indicate that the efficiency of the process is very low. As in any (photo) catalytic reaction, also for the photocatalytic CO2 reduction there is a need for data such as mass balance (moles of CO2 converted going into analyzed products), product distribution, initial reaction rate standardized by the grams of catalyst, time required and light power and activity decay over time that are missing for the majority of the reported studies. All these data should be given when characterizing any new material. Only in that way it will be possible to compare validly one photocatalyst with others. Finally, it is clear that the use of sunlight, solar simulators or visible light as light sources should be generalized in order to move forward towards the possibility to apply the process for fuel production.

Broader context
Due to the shortage of fossil fuels, there is a need for developing renewable fuels for transportation. One possibility is to use photocatalysis to reduce CO2 to form CH3OH or CH4 and other compounds. Among the various types of photocatalysts, titania and related materials have been the most widely used for the catalytic CO2 photoreduction. The different modifications of titania to increase the photocatalytic activity for the production of solar fuels have been reviewed. The present situation of the state of the art indicates that much more efficient and selective photocatalysts are still needed to develop a photocatalytic process with promise for commercial application.
