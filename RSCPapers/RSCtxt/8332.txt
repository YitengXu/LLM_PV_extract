    , Accepted 21st September 2022First published on 5th October 2022AbstractA facile and efficient depolymerization reaction of polymerized small molecule acceptors (PSMAs) is developed and used for recovering the polymeric monomers from PSMAs in various circumstances. The recycled monomers can be repolymerized to afford new PSMA batches for manufacturing all-PSCs, which contributes to decreasing the unit costs of PSMAs and eventually accelerating the practical application of PSMA-based all-PSCs.
All-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs) consisting of polymer donors and polymer acceptors have attracted considerable attention due to their distinct advantages of mechanical flexibility, superior device stability, and potential for low-cost large-scale roll-to-roll processing.1–4 However, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of all-PSCs still lag behind those of their counterparts with non-fullerene small molecule acceptors (NFSMAs) due to the lack of high-performance polymer acceptors.5–8 In this regard, Li et al. proposed an appealing strategy of incorporating high-efficiency SMA units as building blocks to construct polymerized small molecule acceptors (PSMAs),9,10 enabling a significant improvement of all-PSC performance due to the strong absorption of the SMA moiety and the capability of regulating the energy levels and intermolecular aggregation behavior via delicately altering the terminal groups11–15 and centered fused-ring units16–18 of the SMA moiety as well as the copolymerizing linkage moiety.19–21 Recently, a variety of PSMAs constructed with Y6 derivatives have been developed to manufacture all-PSCs with PCEs over 18%17,22–27 and outstanding thermal stability surpassing 5000 h under persistent annealing at 85 °C, demonstrating the promise of Y6-derivative-based PSMAs for the industrialization of PSCs.28,29
Despite the great successes achieved in PSMA-based all-PSCs, the synthetic complexity, batch-to-batch variation and feedstock waste resulting from uncontrollable polydispersity led to the high-cost problem of PSMA materials. For example, the representative PSMAs, PZ1 and (poly[(2,2′-((2Z,2′Z)-((12,13-bis(2-decyltetradecyl)-3,9-diundecyl-12,13-dihydro[1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4e]thieno[2′′,3′′:4′,5′]thieno[2′,3′:4,5]pyrrolo[3,2-g]thieno[2′,3′:4,5]thieno[3,2-b]-indole-2,10-diyl)bis(methanylylidene))bis(3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-indene-2,1-diylidene)) dimalononitrile-alt-2,5-thiophene)]) (PJ1), respectively, required 15 steps and 17 steps of synthetic procedures, and their overall yields were lower than 10%. Moreover, there have been several reports showing that the PSMA batches with unsatisfactory molecular weights could result in remarkably poor photovoltaic performance.16,30,31 Considering that the active-layer materials account for approximately 37%–47% of the overall material costs of PSCs,32,33 the high-cost problem of PSMAs caused by the aforementioned aspects will severely limit their future application in commercialized production.34–37
Herein, a facile and efficient depolymerization of PSMAs (PZ1 and PJ1) is reported using a brominated 1,1-dicyanomethylene-3-indanone (IC-Br) terminal unit and a pyridine catalyst with a simple operation process (Fig. 1a), enabling the high-yield recycling of the SMA monomers Z-ICBr and Y-ICBr. As a result, the Y-ICBr monomers can be efficiently recycled from both light-aged active layer blends (JD40:PJ1) and discarded low-molecular-weight PJ1 from Soxhlet extraction (Fig. 1b). Impressively, it was found that the PJ1 batches obtained from the repolymerization of recycled Y-ICBr exhibited comparable device PCE and stability with the initial PJ1 batch. Moreover, this depolymerization reaction was applicable for various PSMAs, showing its universal efficacy for lowering the material cost of a wide range of PSMAs in the future. Eventually, the synthesis complexity (SC) index and figure-of-merit (FOM) for preparing various PSMAs with different recycling times of the SMA monomers could be significantly decreased due to the almost quantitative yield and facile procedures of recycling and repolymerization in comparison with the de novo synthesis of PSMAs. Overall, this work proposes a cost-effective paradigm to recycle high-cost SMA monomers from the discarded oligomeric extraction portion, inferior PSMA batches and PSMA-based decommissioned devices in the future and could significantly lower the material costs and accelerate the application of PSMA-based all-PSCs.

PJ1 was used as a model polymer to elucidate the depolymerization process. First, the PJ1 polymer scaled-up to the gram level was prepared by the Stille coupling polymerization between the SMA moiety of Y-ICBr and the linkage moiety of 2,5-bis(trimethylstannyl)thiophene according to our previous study (see the Experimental section (1.2.1) in the ESI†).30 The dichloromethane and chloroform portions were collected and the related yields were carefully calculated to be 28% and 68%, respectively (Fig. S1 and S2†). The depolymerization of PJ1 could be smoothly completed under an air atmosphere by the catalyzation of pyridine and with the sole consumption of the relatively cheap compound IC-Br, thereby converting PJ1 to the starting Y-ICBr monomer in 90% yield. The depolymerization can be well monitored using thin-layer chromatography (TLC) results of the reaction mixture, indicating that depolymerized Y-ICBr can be easily separated via flash chromatography due to its distinct Rf value difference with other compounds in the reaction mixture (Fig. S3a†). The recovery of Y-ICBr can be further confirmed by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and mass spectroscopy (MS) characterization of the isolated Y-ICBr from the depolymerization reaction. The characteristic NMR peaks at chemical shifts (δ) of 9.15, 8.81, 8.54, 4.79 and 3.20 ppm (Fig. S4†) and the MS molecular ion peak at 1986.898 (Fig. S5†) clearly demonstrated the accomplishment of Y-ICBr recovery from the depolymerization of PJ1. The depolymerization mechanism was proposed and is shown in Scheme 1. The IC-Br carbanion generated after the addition of pyridine presumably served as a nucleophile in order to undergo a nucleophilic addition reaction on the double bond adjacent to the 1,1-dicyanomethylene-3-indanone (IC) terminal of the PJ1 backbone. The subsequent elimination reaction occurred on intermediate compound 4, eventually affording Y-ICBr and compound 5. To prove this hypothesis, the verification of key intermediate compound 5 was also crucial. The mixtures collected after the Y-ICBr from the silica gel column were characterized using the mass spectrometry method. The peaks of 270.8761 and 466.9377 could be ascribed to compounds 1 and 5, respectively, confirming the generation of compound 5 during the depolymerization reaction (Fig. S6†). To further demonstrate the depolymerization reaction, a model reaction was carried out between compounds 8 and 9 (Scheme 1 and Fig. S7–S9†). As expected, the combined spectral characterization showed that molecule 10 was generated and could be isolated in decent yield (Fig. S3b and S10–S12†). Moreover, the peaks of 190.0409 and 270.9514 for the collected terminal mixtures in the mass spectrum further substantiated the notion that compound 8 underwent a nucleophilic addition–elimination and a terminal unit exchanging process was accomplished (Scheme 1 and Fig. S13†).
 Scheme 1  Proposed reaction pathways of the depolymerization reaction. 
The practicability of this depolymerization reaction for feedstock recycling of active-layer materials (JD40:PJ1) was explored. We first measured the absorption spectra of both the pristine PJ1 and JD40:PJ1 blend films with various light-soaking times to estimate the recycling possibility. As shown in Fig. 2a and b, the absorption intensity in the range of 700–900 nm corresponding to the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) and molecular aggregation of PJ1 gradually decreased, verifying the existence of photooxidation of PJ1 under light-soaking. However, even after being illuminated for 240 h, the absorption maxima of both the PJ1 film and its blend film exhibited high retention rates of over 82%, manifesting that most of the PJ1 can be preserved in the pristine and blend films even under harsh light-soaking conditions, which offers us an opportunity to recycle the feedstock from PSMA-based active-layer blends.

The feasibility of recycling the SMA monomers from blended active layers was investigated. The JD40:PJ1 blends with a total amount of 500 mg (1:1 in weight) were dissolved in chloroform (30 mL) containing 1% chloronaphthalene additive by stirring at 60 °C overnight, and the mixture was poured into a glass Petri dish (diameter 15 cm) and heated on a hot plate to evaporate the solvent for forming a thick active-layer film on the dish under an air atmosphere. After evacuating the solvent additive in the adapter module of a glovebox, the Petri dish containing the active-layer film was light-soaked under an air atmosphere for 240 h without encapsulation. The blend film after light-aging was torn off and added to a round-bottom flask with 50 mL of chloroform. After the addition of IC-Br (4 eq.) and pyridine (1 mL), the mixture was stirred at 50 °C for 4 h under an air atmosphere. Then, the reaction mixture was straightway purified by flash chromatography to afford Y-ICBr in 80% yield. The recycling reaction can be confirmed using both the TLC result and the combined characterization by NMR spectroscopy and MALDI-TOF spectrometry (Fig. S3c, S14 and S15†). The high recycling rate of the SMA monomers from the blend film shows the feasibility of chemical feedstock recycling from end-of-life devices in future applications, which will remarkably reduce the energy payback time.
Other long-standing challenges of PSCs are the batch-to-batch variation in polymer performance and the feedstock waste due to the formation of undesired low-molecular-weight components caused by the uncontrollable characteristic of step-growth polymerization.38–41 For example, during the preparation of PSMAs, a certain portion of the dichloromethane (DCM) extraction component, mainly consisting of SMA oligomers, generally showed inferior photovoltaic performance, and occasionally some batches of PSMAs exhibiting unsatisfactory device performance would also be encountered. Both of them are inevitable and generally discarded as useless materials, causing a severe waste of high-cost SMA building blocks. Here, Y-ICBr was also successfully recycled in a high yield of 92% from the DCM component of Soxhlet extraction for PJ1 according to the aforementioned procedures (Fig. S3d, S16 and S17†).
To further highlight the practical application of this depolymerization reaction, the recycled monomers were further reused for the preparation of new PJ1 batches. The photovoltaic performances of all-PSC devices fabricated with the repolymerized PJ1 batches were carefully investigated. By finely tuning the polymerization conditions, the Y-ICBr monomers recycled from the light-soaked blends and low-molecular-weight PJ1 extraction component were repolymerized with 2,5-bis(trimethylstannyl)thiophene to afford the PJ1-LS batch and PJ1-DM batch, respectively (Scheme S1†). Both batches of PJ1 exhibited comparable molecular weights with the pristine PJ1 (Fig. S18 and S19†). Subsequently, the PJ1-LS batch and PJ1-DM batch were, respectively, blended with JD40 to manufacture all-PSCs, achieving the PCEs of 15.35% and 15.75%, comparable with the 15.44% of the initial PJ1-based device (Fig. 3a and Table 1). The all-PSCs based on different PJ1 batches showed similar external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves (Fig. 3b), resulting in JSCs with deviation less than 3% (Table 1). Notably, after illuminating for 348 h, all devices based on different PJ1 batches retained 85% of the initial PCEs (Fig. S20†), suggesting that the all-PSCs based on the repolymerized PJ1 batches possessed high stability comparable with the device based on the pristine PJ1 batch. These results demonstrated the comparable efficacy of the repolymerized PSMAs from recycled SMA monomers with the de novo-synthesized PSMAs for all-PSCs.

The synthetic complexity (SC) index and figure of merit (FOM) are two key parameters to assess the industrial production potential for various photovoltaic systems.42,43 Due to the high yield and simple procedure of preparing PJ1 from the recycling process (2 step reaction) in comparison with the de novo synthesis of PJ1 (17 step reaction), we therefore examined the SC index and FOM parameters with feedstock (Y-ICBr) recycling. Here, the SC index and FOM of PJ1 with different recycling times were estimated by considering the monomer recycling of the blended active layer and low-molecular-weight dichloromethane extraction component (Schemes S2–S6 and Tables S1–S2†). It could be observed that both Y-ICBr and PJ1 showed a high SC index of over 85%, which is slightly lower than that of PZ1 and remarkably higher than that of the representative polymer acceptor N2200 (32.62%). As a result, although PJ1-based all-PSCs demonstrated higher efficiency than their N2200-based counterparts, a FOM of 5.78 was observed, significantly higher than the 2.76 of N2200. However, after five-time recycling of Y-ICBr for repolymerizing PJ1, the SC index and FOM of PJ1 substantially decreased to 33.39% and 2.11, respectively (Fig. 4a and b). It is noteworthy that the FOM of PJ1 was even slightly lower than that of N2200 (2.11 vs. 2.76). To further highlight the merit of this depolymerization reaction, the unit cost of PJ1 was estimated by considering the recycling process. As shown in Table S3,† without feedstock recycling, the unit cost (UC) of PJ1 was higher than 1183 ¥ g−1. After the recycling operation by considering the depolymerization and reuse of the active-layer materials and DCM batch, the UC was remarkably decreased. When the recycling was performed five times, the UC was reduced by more than half to 546.3 ¥ g−1. These observations further suggested that the feedstock recycling of PSMAs may be a useful strategy to reduce the unit cost of PSMAs, showing great potential for accelerating the commercialization of PSMA-based all-PSCs. Considering that most PSMAs contain the 1,1-dicyanomethylene-3-indanone unit, our newly developed depolymerization reaction is promising to be a universal method for recycling the feedstock from various PSMAs. Therefore, the depolymerization was performed on two other PSMAs PJ2 and PZ1, which are different from PJ1 in the linkage unit and the SMA building block. Consequently, both PJ2 and PZ1 showed high monomer recovery yields of over 85% according to the aforementioned procedures (Fig. S3e, 3f, and S21–S25 and Scheme S7†). Further explorations focusing on the application of this depolymerization reaction to more PSMAs are ongoing in our lab.

Conclusions
In summary, an innovative depolymerization reaction of PMSAs was reported and its nucleophilic addition–elimination reaction mechanism was elucidated. This depolymerization was successfully used for high-yield recycling of the feedstock from various PSMAs. SMA monomers were demonstrated to be recovered from the depolymerization of both the blended active layer and discarded low-molecular-weight PJ1 oligomers. Moreover, the recycled monomers can be reused for the preparation of PJ1, and all-PSCs fabricated with the repolymerized PJ1 batches exhibited similar photovoltaic performances to the device based on the pristine PJ1 batch. The SC index and FOM of PJ1 prepared with the recycled feedstock were significantly decreased with increasing the recycling times. Our findings provide a facile and efficient approach to recycle costly SMA monomers from PSMAs in various circumstances, which would contribute to decreasing the unit costs of PSMAs and eventually accelerating the practical application of PSMA-based all-PSCs.
