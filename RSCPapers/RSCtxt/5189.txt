    , Accepted 10th January 2015First published on 15th January 2015AbstractHexagonal-phase NaYbF4:Er3+ upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) have been synthesized via a co-precipitation method in high-boiling-point solvents, and remarkably enhanced upconversion luminescence, particularly in red emission bands (650–670 nm) in NaYbF4:Er3+ UCNPs, has been achieved by Mn2+ doping. The underlying reason for luminescence enhancement by Mn2+ doping is explored by a series of controlled experiments, and a mechanism of enhancement based on the decrease of Na+-vacancies and organic adsorption is proposed. The Mn2+ substitution disturbs the equilibrium of the charge and crystal lattice in the hexagonal-phase NaYbF4:Er3+ UCNPs, which makes the Na+-vacancies that quenched luminescence become filled with Na+ or Mn2+ to offset the imbalance of the charge and electron cloud distortion. In addition, the Mn2+ doping at the surface of UCNPs could reduce the organic adsorption on the surface of the UCNPs by an extra F− ion on the grain surface resulting in luminescence enhancement. Therefore, the Mn2+-doping approach provides a facile strategy for improvement of luminescence, which will impact on the field of bioimaging based on UCNP nanoprobes.
Introduction
Lanthanide (Ln) doped nanomaterials show superior optical properties, including large effective Stokes shifts, sharp emission bands, weak background luminescence as well as high resistance to photobleaching.1–4 These unique properties, coupled with size- and shape-independent luminescence phenomena, confer Ln3+ doped nanoparticles (NPs) applications in a very wide range of fields. Optics encoding, new-generation lighting, silicon solar cells and biological probes are good examples of their applications.5–8 In particular, the upconversion NPs (UCNPs) with a small diameter (sub-20 nm) and intense red emission are in high demand in luminescence imaging experiments, in which the NPs should be comparable in size to the biomolecules they label and simultaneously should not cause a tissue absorption problem by their emission.9,10 Therefore, luminescence imaging on the basis of UCNPs is becoming a popular tool for biomedical assay and diagnosis due to the high resolution and convenience.11,12
Another consideration is the brightness of UCNPs for bioimaging. Generally speaking, the brighter the nanoprobe, the higher the signal-to-noise ratio. Despite significant progress in using UCNPs, the low emission efficiency of UCNPs with varied structural defect centers accompanied with weak penetration greatly limits the practical application of in vivo imaging.13,14 This limitation is proposed to be solved by employing many strategies, such as constructing composite NPs with alloy,15 doping,16–18 core/shell19–23 or Janus structures.24 Introducing hybridization and metal substrates to enhance the luminescence has also been used for this purpose.25 But most of these are either hard to implement or only suitable for individual Ln3+ ions.
Codoping is a widely applied technology in Ln3+ doped UC materials science that involves incorporating atoms or ions of appropriate elements into host lattices to yield hybrid materials with desirable properties such as modifying the electronic properties,26 stabilizing a specific crystallographic phase27 or constructing energy transfer.28 It has been reported that doping other ions such as Li+, Al3+ and Zn2+ can also significantly enhance the luminescence in GdTaO4:Eu3+.29 The enhancement effect of various doped ions could even be associated with the effective ionic radius of the codopant ions and the mismatch of electronegativity between the doping ions and Ln3+.
As a popular strategy, the doping of lanthanide impurities into the host materials is an efficient way to produce UCNPs with diversified size and emission. For example, NaYF4 is a classic host material for constructing UCNPs. The codoping of Yb3+ with Er3+ or Tm3+ generates basic green or blue emission.30 Further combinations of a variety of Ln3+ and/or construction of core–shell structures permit the tuning of the UC emission from the visible to the NIR region.31
Although Ln3+ is successful in tuning the emission color and/or size, the limited supply and increasing price go against the applicability of the UCNPs. Transition metal ions are efficient dopants for tuning the emission of semiconductor NPs, but are rarely applied on UCNPs. On the other hand, the size, shape and phase of UCNPs also have great influence on their luminescence and biological application.27,32 Thus, as ideal UCNPs based bioprobes, all these properties should be fully considered. However, simultaneous control of the structure (nanocrystal size, shape, and phase) and enhancement in UC luminescence, especially dominated by red emission in UCNPs with a fixed formula is still a great challenge and is rarely reported. A few reports have been related to luminescence enhancement, such as Yb3+/Er3+ codoped KMnF3 by Liu's group33 and Mn2+ doped cubic phase NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+.9,34 In addition, the red-to-green (R/G) ratio can be greatly enhanced owing to the energy transfer between Mn2+ and Er3+ in the reported UCNPs systems. The explicit reason for the luminescence enhancement by Mn2+ doping ions is not very clear. It is well known that hexagonal-phase NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ bulk materials exhibit about an order of magnitude enhancement of UC efficiency relative to their cubic phase counterparts.35 However, hexagonal-phase NaYF4 possesses higher polarizability than cubic phase NaYF4, thus not being more compatible with Mn2+.36 Nevertheless, enhanced luminescence from hexagonal-phase NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ or NaYbF4:Er3+ NCs by Mn2+ doping has not been reported.
We aim to synthesize the small hexagonal-phase NaYbF4:Er3+ UCNPs with bright and red emission by doping Mn2+ in high-boiling-point organic solvents. To reveal the Mn2+ doping effect in the hexagonal-phase NaYbF4 UCNPs, a series of experiments are employed in the current work. The results show that Mn2+ doping not only slightly reduces the diameter of UCNPs, but also remarkably enhances UC luminescence, particularly in red emission bands (650–670 nm). The mechanism of luminescence enhancement by Mn2+ doping is revealed.
Experimental section
Chemicals
Yb(CH3CO2)3·xH2O (99.99%), Er(CH3CO2)3·xH2O (99.99%), Mn(CH3CO2)2·4H2O (98+ %), 1-octadecene (90%), and oleic acid (90%), were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. NaOH (98+ %) and NH4F (98+ %) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Company of China. Unless otherwise noted, all chemicals were used as received without further purification.
Synthesis of hexagonal-phase NaYbF4:Mn2+/Er3+ UCNPs
Mn2+/Er3+ co-doped NaYbF4 UCNPs were synthesized according to the previously reported co-deposition method.37 In a typical NaYbF4:Mn2+/Er3+ NP synthesis procedure, 2.5 mL water solution of Ln(CH3CO2)3 (0.2 M, Ln = Yb, and Er) and Mn(CH3CO2)2 was added to a 50 mL flask containing 6 mL of oleic acid and 14 mL of 1-octadecene. The mixture was heated at 150 °C for 1 h to remove the water content from the solution before cooling down to 50 °C. Shortly thereafter, 5 mL of methanol solution containing NH4F (2.4 mmol) and NaOH (1.8 mmol) was added and the resulting solution was stirred for 30 min. After the methanol was evaporated, the solution was heated to 310 °C under argon for 1 h and then cooled down to room temperature. The resulting NPs were precipitated by addition of ethanol, collected by centrifugation at 6000 rpm for 10 min, washed with ethanol several times, and re-dispersed in 5 mL of cyclohexane.
Characterization
Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) data were recorded on a D/Max2550VB+/PC X-ray diffraction meter with Cu Kα (40 kV, 40 mA) irradiation (λ = 0.15406 nm). Low magnification transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution TEM imaging were carried out on a JEOL 2010F transmission electron microscope operated at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. TEM samples were prepared by dipping a copper grid (200 mesh) coated with an amorphous carbon film into NP solutions and then drying it at room temperature. An energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) facility attached to the FEI Quanta 200 environment scanning electron microscope (SEM) was employed to analyze the chemical composition. Thermal analysis was performed by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) (TGA–DSC, STA 449C, Netzsch, Germany) at a heating rate of 20 °C min−1. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was carried out using a Bruker EQUINX55 spectrometer with KBr pellets. A Ti:sapphire continuum laser (MBR-110) was employed as the UC excitation source. The monochromator (SP 2750i) with a spectral resolution of approximately 0.008 nm and a charge coupled device (ACTON, PIXIS 100) was used for luminescence collection and detection. The corresponding notch filters were placed in front of the entrance of the monochromator to block the scattering light. All the measurements were performed at room temperature.
Results and discussion
In our current system, the co-precipitation route in an oxygen-free organic-phase synthetic system is employed to prepare monodisperse, highly crystalline, well-defined, and phase-pure Ln3+ doped NPs. Fig. 1 shows the X-ray diffraction pattern of NaYbF4:Er3+ (2 mol%) samples doped with different amounts of Mn2+ ions. The dopant Mn2+ ions have a negligible effect on the phase structure since all the diffraction peaks of the samples still correspond to the pure hexagonal phase (JCPDS no. 27-1427) without admixture of the cubic phase or other impurities, indicating the formation of a Yb–Mn solid solution. Some samples contained a small residual amount of NaF, most obvious from its 2θ reflection at 38.8°. To reveal the subtle differences caused by Mn2+ doping, a selected region of diffraction peaks, marked by a rectangle in Fig. 1a, was magnified as shown in Fig. 1b. These peaks gradually shift toward higher angles as the Mn2+ concentration increases from 0 to 20 mol%, and then shift slightly toward smaller angles as the Mn2+ concentration increases to 40 mol%. The results indicate that Mn2+ occupies a Yb3+ site in the presence of the low amount of Mn2+, and then Mn2+ act as the interstitial atom in NaYbF4 NPs on increasing Mn2+ dosage to 40 mol%.

It is reported that NaYF4 crystals have a Na+-vacancies chain along the c-axis and all Na+ have neighboring vacancies.38 Considering charge unbalance induced by the Mn2+ ions occupying trivalent Ln3+ ions and the Na+ ionic radius with larger ionic radius than Yb3+ (1.24 Å and 1.075 Å for Na+ and Yb3+ ions) in NaYbF4 NPs, the possibility of doping Mn2+ in the Na+-vacancies chain of NaYbF4 cell cannot be fully excluded. It was noted that the diffraction peaks of NaF gradually become strengthened as the Mn2+ concentration increases from 0 to 20 mol%, and then disappear as the Mn2+ concentration increases from 20 mol% to 40 mol% (Fig. 1a), which may indirectly indicate that Na+-vacancies are filled with Na+ at first and then with Mn2+ to compensate the charge imbalance generated by the Mn2+ ions substituting for the Yb3+ ions.
TEM provides further insight into the morphology and microstructural details of Ln3+ based nanostructures. Fig. 2 shows typical TEM images of these Ln3+ compound UCNPs, from which it can be seen that the obtained NaYbF4:Er3+ NPs without Mn2+ doping present the regularly hexagonal-shape plate with an average diameter of about 120 nm and a thickness of 30 nm as shown in Fig. 2a. It can be seen that most of the nanoplates lie flat on their faces, and some stand on their edges. The doping of 10 mol% Mn2+ slightly reduces the diameter of UCNCs to 80 nm (Fig. 2b). On further increasing Mn2+ dosage to 40 mol%, the quasi-spherical UCNPs with a size of 18 nm are obtained (Fig. 2d). An additional high-resolution TEM image of NaYbF4:Er3+ NPs obtained in the presence of 40 mol% Mn2+ shown in Fig. 2e depicts interplanar spacings of 0.523 nm corresponding to the {100} planes of hexagonal-phase NaYbF4. The SAED pattern shown in Fig. 2f provides further evidence of the formation of single phase crystalline hexagonal NaYbF4 with an orientation along the [011] zone axis.

Undoubtedly, EDX is a convenient way to reveal a change in the elemental composition of crystals. Fig. 3 shows the EDX analysis of hexagonal-phase NaYbF4:Er3+ with and without Mn2+ doping, revealing the existence of the dopant elemental Mn2+ in Mn2+ doped hexagonal-phase NaYbF4:Er3+ NPs. The EDX results shown in Table 1 indicate that the doped Mn2+ is 1.1 and 1.8 mol% for the UCNPs with the Mn2+ feed ratio of 20 and 40 mol%, respectively. It is found that the ratio of Na+/(Ln3+ + Mn2+) is higher than the value of 1 in Mn2+ doped UCNPs, which is much higher than the stoichiometry in NaLnF4 crystals. In our experiment, with the aim to achieve a high usage of expensive Ln3+, the Na+-to-Ln3+ molar feed ratio is 3.6. This leads to NaF impurity, and hence the much higher Na+ content. Interestingly, it is noted that the ratio of Na+/(Ln3+ + Mn2+) increases first and then decreases as Mn2+ concentration increases (Table 1), which is consistent with the result of the NaF content in the XRD pattern (Fig. 1a). The size-shrinkage effect of NaYbF4 UCNPs induced by doping Mn2+ is similar to the previous report of NaYF4:Mn2+/Er3+ UCNPs (Fig. 2a–d). In fact, the substitution of Yb3+ by Mn2+ in NaYbF4 could cause an extra F− ion on the grain surface and then induce transient electric dipoles with their negative poles pointing outward,9 which substantially hinders the diffusion of the F− ions needed for crystal growth from the solution to the grain surface, consequently resulting in a size-shrinkage of NaYbF4 UCNPs.

It is desirable to tune Er3+ or Tm3+ emissions to yield sharp emission bands within a broad spectral range. However, it is highly challenging to obtain intense UC emission with high chromatic purity. We first vary Mn2+ concentrations and exploit the metastable Mn2+:4T1 state to tune for pure red and NIR UC emissions under 980 nm excitation. The results of a systematic study of the effects of Mn2+ ion contents on the emission intensity (red/green ratio) are shown in Fig. 4. NaYbF4:Er3+ UCNPs with and without Mn2+ doping exhibit three distinct emission bands in the visible region at 518–536, 544–556, and 649–671 nm originating from the 2H11/2→4I15/2, 4S3/2→4I15/2, and 4F9/2→4I15/2 transitions of Er3+ ions, respectively.39 Clearly, the intensity of UC emission in the red region (649–671 nm) is higher than that in the green region (518–556 nm) in all UCNPs. Interestingly, the total luminescence intensity and ratio of red to green first increases and then decreases when the Mn2+ dopant concentration increases from 0 to 10, 20, and 40 mol% (Fig. 4). The total luminescence intensity of NaYbF4:Er3+ UCNPs doped with 20 mol% of Mn2+ ions is about 20 times higher than that of NaYbF4:Er3+ UCNPs doped without Mn2+. But the green luminescence intensity cannot be fully excluded in the samples by elevating the amount of Mn2+ dopant (Fig. 4), which is rather unexpected. The previous reports show that the introduction of sufficient Mn2+ ions into cubic phase NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ not only facilitates the output of pure red emission but also enhances the intensity of UC emission.9,33,34 Such luminescence enhancement and spectral tuning are ascribed to the change in the surrounding environment of light-emitting Ln3+ and the cross-relaxation of energy between Er3+ and Mn2+ ions. In the present case, the pure red luminescence cannot be obtained by doping Mn2+, which may indicate a low Mn2+ doping level and a slight energy transfer between the Er3+:4S2/3 state and Mn2+:4T1 state.

In order to optimize the experimental parameters to gain an enhanced red luminescence intensity, similar experiments were also performed in the other samples with different Er3+ concentrations. With the concentration of Mn2+ fixed at 20 mol%, it was found that as the molar ratio of Er3+ was increased from 1.0 to 10.0 mol%, the intensity of the emission increased first and then decreased significantly (Fig. 5). When the concentrations of Er3+ ions go up to 2 mol%, red luminescence intensity reaches its peak value. If further elevating the amount of Er3+ dopants to 5.0 mol%, red luminescence intensity is quenched significantly while green luminescence intensity remains almost unchanged, indicating that the red to green ratio can be tuned by varying the Er3+ concentration.

To better understand the mechanism by which the 2H11/2, 4S3/2, and 4F9/2 excited states are populated following NIR irradiation, we consider that some measurements, where the upconversion luminescent properties of fluoride microcrystals as a function of excitation power under 980 nm excitation, are necessary for the investigation of electronic population and depopulation processes of luminescence levels. Fig. 6 shows the log–log plot of the emission intensity as a function of excitation power for the green and the red emissions, respectively. In Fig. 6a, the band centered at 544 nm (green) of NaYbF4:Er3+ without Mn2+ doping is dominated by a two-photon upconversion process. However, the slopes n begin to gradually decrease from 1.77 to 0.93 with increasing Mn2+ concentration, indicating an absorptive saturation effect of the intermediate excited states. By careful observation of Fig. 6a, we find that all our experimental log–log curves of green UC luminescence vs. pumping laser power are basically rather good straight lines. However, as we know in the case of typical saturation, the log–log plot of the emission intensity as a function of excitation power is not a straight line, but a typical saturation curve that gradually bends downward.40 So, we believe that this phenomenon is not a simple typical saturation phenomenon caused by population exhaustion in the ground state. In Fig. 6b, for the red emission, the values of n were determined to be 1.81, 1.87, 1.89, and 2.10 in a series of samples with or without Mn2+, indicating a two-photon UC process. The value of n for red luminescence slightly increased with the increase of the amount of Mn2+.
 Fig. 6  Log–log pots of emission intensity as a function of excitation power for green emission (a) and the red emission (b). 
When Mn2+ is codoped, the cross-relaxation of energy between the Er3+:4S2/3 state and Mn2+:4T1 state is rampant, which decreases the green luminescence intensity in the 4S2/3 state and increases the red luminescence intensity in the 4F9/2 state. It is well known that the emission intensity (IUCL) increased on pumping laser power (IP) obeying a rule of IUCL ∝ IPn.41 The increase of green luminescence is finite after doping Mn2+ due to the energy transfer between the Er3+:4S2/3 state and Mn2+:4T1 state. In such a case, the decrease (increase) of the luminescence intensity of two-photon luminescence results in the drop (ascent) of n for green (red) emission. The proposed conversion mechanism is shown in Fig. 7.
 Fig. 7  Energy level diagrams of Er3+, Yb3+ and Mn2+ and the relative transitions. 
To effectively understand why this total luminescence enhancement phenomenon occurs in the doped Mn2+ UCNPs, the structural properties of the samples under investigation must certainly be discussed. The hexagonal structure of NaYbF4 has three cation sites, one for Yb3+ ions (1a), one for both Yb3+ and Na+ ions (1f), and the third for Na+ ions (2h) (Fig. 8a).42 From the structural illustration of NaYbF4 along the c-axis shown in Fig. 8b, it can be easily observed that the 2h sodium ions are located in channels constructed from (Na/Yb)Fn polyhedra, which results in a 2h Na+ ion site contaminated by a small number of Ln ions,38,43,44 and the sodium vacancies are simultaneously present. The actual situation of NaYbF4 is an Nax□1−x chain along the c-axis with all sodium atoms having a neighboring vacancy (□), which results in a chain of alternating sodium atoms and vacancies.42 In fact, in the NaYbF4 structure Yb3+ may be partially substituted by Na+ on the (2c) site. For each of those, two further Na+ ions are added on the formerly unoccupied site (2b) for charge compensation. This results in the formula Na12x(Na2xYb2−x)F6 or, abbreviated, Na3xYb2−xF6. On decreasing x, the number of vacancies increases. This clearly shows that the chemical component of sodium in the hexagonal-phase NaYbF4 structure can be modified.
 Fig. 8  Schematic presentation showing the arrangement of the cation sites in (a) and crystal structures along the c-axis (b) for hexagonal phase NaYbF4 NPs. All sites are identical and the colors are used to identify different packing layers of NaYbF4. 
It has been reported that the vacancies of sodium in the hexagonal Na3xM2−xCl6-type (M = Ln3+) structure have a much more crucial impact on quenching luminescence than crystal size or morphology. But the Na3xM2−xCl6-type structure exists as a channel structure in which there is Ln3+ contamination and a deficiency of the sodium content, and therefore provides a chance for the substitution or insertion of Mn2+ ions. As a result, a few Mn2+ adsorbed on the UCNP surface incorporate into the Na3xM2−xCl6 matrix lattice by substituting Ln3+, and simultaneously induce Na+ inserting sodium vacancies for charge compensation. In addition, the Mn2+ attaching on the UCNPs surface could retard the growth of NaYbF4 UCNPs and organic contamination by inducing transient electric dipoles via an extra F− ion on the grain surface, which is further supported by FTIR spectra in Fig. 9. The interior doping Mn2+ could not only induce new electric dipoles and then increase the interaction between them, but could also undoubtedly prompt Na+ to fill the sodium vacancies reducing vacancy defects, which could result in luminescence enhancement. A similar case is reported in which, by inserting sodium ions into the hexagonal bipyramid crystal lattice by post-treatment, the emission is enhanced by as much as a factor of 25000.38 Consequently, it is reasonable to assume that the doped Mn2+ within the UCNPs and on the UCNP surface may jointly be responsible for red luminescence enhancement.

Mn2+ is more compatible with the cubic NaMF4 rather than the hexagonal one for polarizability reasons.45 The EDX analysis shown in Fig. 3 indicates that there are only trace amounts of Mn2+ impurities in the hexagonal-phase NaYbF4 host. The lower doping efficiency of Mn2+ could not provide an effective energy transfer between Er3+ and Mn2+ ions, which are supported by a less obvious increase of the red/green ratio. It is noted that the ratios of Na+/(Ln3+ + Mn2+) in hexagonal-phase NaYbF4 NPs with various Mn2+ concentrations increase with the increase of the amount of Mn2+ dopant (Table 1). This result indirectly supported the deduction that the interior doping Mn2+ induces the Na+ insertion into sodium vacancies.
Generally, the UC efficiency of NPs depends on the surface properties and the matrix of which the particles consist.46 The surface-related high-frequency vibrational modes play an important role in the UC process.47 As is well-known, Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy is a powerful tool for identifying the different types of chemical bonds in a molecule.48 The FTIR spectra of NPs with and without Mn2+ doping are shown in Fig. 9. The oleic acid exhibits a broadband at around 3450 cm−1 and a peak at around 1640 cm−1, corresponding to the stretching vibration and bending of a hydroxyl group. Two peaks associated with asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations of the CO group can be found at 1571 and 1458 cm−1 in the spectra, respectively. In addition, two peaks at 2924 and 2854 cm−1 are assigned to asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations of a C–H group, respectively, which exists in the long alkyl chain of the oleic acid molecule. However, FTIR spectra show a down trend of the oleate-related absorption intensities after doping Mn2+, confirming the presence of transient electric dipoles with their negative poles pointing outward. This is consistent with the above statement.
TG-DSC is carried out to further testify the content of organic compound in inorganic materials. TGA curves are shown in Fig. 10. The part of the weight loss about 4.95% for NaYbF4:Er3+ (2 mol%) UCNPs and 3.07% for NaYbF4:Mn2+/Er3+(40/2 mol%) UCNPs from 50 to 600 °C can be ascribed to the decomposition of organic compound of the samples, which supports the result of FTIR analysis. Note that just a slight weight loss from 50 to 150 °C, originating from a very small amount of water that is adsorbed on the surface of particles, cannot be fully excluded.

Conclusions
A method of transition metal Mn2+ doping for the simultaneous size control and the enhanced red emission in NaYbF4:Er3+ UCNPs with fixed compositions of both host and dopants of Ln3+ is demonstrated. The mechanisms of the enhanced luminescence are revealed. The traced Mn2+ doping includes surface doping and interior doping. For interior doping, Mn2+ may occupy the lattice and/or the Na+-vacancies in the NaYbF4 lattice, while the interior Mn2+ substitution disturbs the charge equilibrium and crystal lattice caused by the size mismatch. When the amount of Mn2+ ions was further increased, the Na+-vacancies close to Mn2+ ions were filled with Na+ or Mn2+ to offset the imbalance of the charge and the distortion of the electron cloud of the ions. On the other hand, the Mn2+ doping at the surface of NPs could induce transient electric dipoles with their negative poles pointing outward, and substantially hinder the growth of particles and organic adsorption at the surface of NPs, which is verified by FTIR spectra. Because Mn2+ doping favors the synthesis of NCs with small size and enhanced red UC emission that are highly desired in biomedicine, the current effort will promote the biomedical applications of UCNPs.
