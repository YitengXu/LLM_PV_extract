    , Accepted 8th January 2022First published on 10th January 2022AbstractGraphdiyne (GDY), a new allotrope of carbon, also has a higher potential in photocatalysis due to its narrow bandgap and high electron–hole mobility. For the first time, a GDY–CuBr composite with high hydrogen evolution performance was synthesized using CuBr as a catalytic substrate rather than copper foil in this work. GDY–CuBr exhibits clearly superior activity when compared to the GDY–CuI catalyst synthesized with CuI as the substrate. Washing with ammonia water several times to remove CuBr yields relatively pure GDY. Triethanolamine (TEOA) was used as the sacrificial reagent and Eosin-Y as the sensitizer. When compared to CuBr as the catalytic substrate, the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance of GDY–CuBr was three times stronger. The improved hydrogen production activity of GDY–CuBr in the Eosin-Y (EY) sensitization system can be attributed to GDY's unique pore structure, which encourages the adsorption of EY molecules. Furthermore, the p–n heterojunction formed between CuBr and GDY effectively promotes the charge transfer in the system. This work is a good starting point for investigating and extending the possible synthesis and applications of GDY materials in the field of photocatalysis.
1. Introduction
From traditional non-renewable fossil energy to green, clean, and renewable energy that can reduce the environmental burden, our exploration of energy has never stopped. Clean energy is becoming increasing important in today's era of rapid technological development.1–4 Solar and hydrogen energy, among the numerous sources of clean energy, have piqued the interest of many academics due to their respective popularity and high calorific value characteristic.5–10 Since the concept of photocatalytic hydrogen production was proposed a few decades ago, researchers have developed a variety of photocatalysts to pursue the use of abundant solar resources to achieve the efficient conversion of solar energy to hydrogen energy.11–15
Since the famous theorist Baughman and others proposed the structural model of graphdiyne for the first time in 1987, graphdiyne has piqued the interest of researchers from all walks of life as an emerging material in carbon materials.16 According to their investigative progress, Haley et al. inferred the most stable graphdiyne structure, namely γgraphdiyne (γ-GDY), through theoretical calculations by 1997.17 Until 2010, the hexaynyl benzene was polymerized on the surface of a copper foil in situ by Li et al., resulting in the first successful preparation of γ-GDY films.18 As a key member of the graphdiyne family, γ-GDY has distinct properties such as nano-scale pores, a two-dimensional layered conjugated framework structure, and semiconductor properties, which give it clear advantages in electrochemistry, photocatalysis, nonlinear optics, and electronics.19–21 For the sake of brevity, we will refer to γ-GDY as GDY in the following text. GDY is a narrow bandgap semiconductor material with a bandgap of about 0.46–1.22 eV and a high electron and hole migration rate according to various calculation methods.22–24 It can effectively improve the light absorption properties of semiconductor materials, promote photo-generated electron and hole transfer, and improve the separation efficiency of photoinduced electron–hole pairs in the field of photocatalysis.25,26 Therefore, as an emerging member of the carbon material family, GDY is a very promising photocatalyst in photocatalysis.
For example, Yao et al. successfully synthesized a graphdiyne–WS2 nanohybrid electrocatalyst with excellent catalytic activity in acidic media for hydrogen evolution compared to pure graphdiyne.27 Furthermore, Han et al. constructed a metal-free 2D/2D heterojunction between graphitic carbon nitride and graphdiyne, which successfully increased the hole mobility of graphitic carbon nitride.28 Furthermore, by controlling the growth of MoS2 nanosheets on 2D N-doped graphdiyne nanolayers, Yu et al. achieved highly associated effects on water reduction.29 Lv et al. successfully synthesized CdS/graphdiyne heterojunctions in situ, in an attempt to improve photocatalytic hydrogen production activity.30 Nevertheless, due to the limitations of the graphdiyne synthesis method on copper foil or foamed copper, the related reports on its photocatalysis are not very detailed. Using materials made of Cu+ cations and X− (Cl, Br, or I) rather than copper foil or foamed copper appears to be a good choice. The method of using CuI powder to replace copper foil has yielded tentative results in our research group's preliminary work. Li et al. developed a novel improved graphdiyne synthesis and application approach strategy for effective photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. Zhang et al. developed a new CuI–GD/g-C3N4 S-scheme heterojunction composite for effective photocatalytic hydrogen evolution.31,32 However, the created GDY–CuI composite's hydrogen generation is not ideal. Considering the practicality of employing CuI instead of copper foil for the whole synthesis of GDY, the focus of this work is on investigating the generated composite's hydrogen production activity after using cuprous bromide (CuBr) as the catalytic substrate for the total synthesis of GDY.
In addition to using CuBr as the catalytic substrate for the first time, this work compares the difference in hydrogen production activity between GDY–CuBr and GDY–CuI. Because CuI and CuBr can dissolve in liquid ammonia, pure GDY can be obtained by repeatedly washing the product with ammonia water. CuBr, as a p-type semiconductor, interacts with GDY to establish a functional p–n heterojunction.33 The formation of a p–n heterojunction between the final manufactured composite GDY–CuBr significantly enhances the transfer rate of electron–hole pairs between the system, which could be one of the internal explanations for the improved hydrogen production activity of GDY–CuBr.34 More crucially, making use of GDY's unique two-dimensional planar network structure and the large triangular hole structure composed of 18 C atoms assists in the adsorption of EY molecules and makes it more conducive to the hydrogen production reaction.35
2. Experimental section
2.1 Preparation of photocatalysts
Based on the approach previously published by Li et al., this study investigated the feasibility of synthesizing GDY with CuBr rather than copper foil.18Table 1 lists the reagents used in the experimental preparation. Furthermore, the synthesis process depicted in Scheme 1 can be divided into the following four steps. To begin, replace the air in the three-necked flask with N2 for 10 min to guarantee that all of the air in the bottle has been completely replaced by N2. Following that, 35 mL of tetrahydrofuran (THF) is added at −78 °C, and 4.3 mL of trimethylsilylacetylene is added while stirring. Add 12 mL of THF solution containing 30 mmol n-butyllithium in a dropwise manner. After 30 min of stirring, 20 mL Zinc chloride (0.7 mol L−1 in THF) is added. After another 30 min of stirring, the refrigeration is switched off until the reaction solution temperature reached room temperature. Ensure that N2 is continually flowing throughout the process. Then, in order, add 25 mL of high dry toluene, 1.104 g of hexabromobenzene (C6Br6), and 0.5 g of tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium to the aforementioned three-necked flask in an oil bath. Avoid exposing the reaction environment to air, and stir the abovementioned mixture for 3 days at 80 °C. Following the above reaction, 20 mL of 1 M diluted hydrochloric acid is added to the solution, and the mixed organic layer is extracted using ethyl acetate. After repeated washes with saturated saline and deionized water, dry with anhydrous sodium sulfate, rotate the solution, and dissolve in n-hexane. Separate and purify by column chromatography, using n-hexane and dichloromethane as eluents (17/3), then rotate and evaporate to dryness to yield a light yellow hexabenzene solid. Continuing with this procedure, add another 20 mL of tetrahydrofuran and 0.4 mL of tetrabutylammonium fluoride (1.0 mol L−1 in THF) to dissolve the above solid under N2 protection, and stir for 10 min at 8 °C. The above-mentioned is then diluted with ethyl acetate, washed several times with saturated brine, and dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate. Hexaynylbenzene is obtained through rotary evaporation to dryness. Finally, under N2 protection, dissolve the obtained hexaynylbenzene in 25 mL of pyridine, and gently add it dropwise to a three-necked flask containing 50 mL of pyridine and 100 mg cuprous bromide (CuBr), at 60 °C for 24 h, then continue to react for 12 h. The resultant suspension is then rotary evaporated to dryness to acquire the final product GDY–CuBr, after being washed several times with ammonia water to obtain pure GDY. Using the same method of preparation, the resultant catalyst was designated GDY–CuI after substituting the catalytic substrate with copper(I) iodide (CuI). The obtained sample was labeled GDY(CI) after repeated washing with ammonia water.

2.2 Photocatalytic hydrogen production
In 30 mL of triethanolamine (TEOA) aqueous solution (15 v%) with pH = 10, 10 mg of the prepared sample and 20 mg of EY were dispersed. The hydrogen production process was carried out in a 62 mL quartz reaction flask, with a simulated light source from a 5 W LED light. The suspension was ultrasonically dispersed for 20 min, until the sample was uniformly dissolved and the system was moderately stable. After that, the bottle was filled with nitrogen for 10 min to replace the air until an anaerobic environment favourable to hydrogen production generation was formed. The reaction flask was placed in a multi-channel reaction system, and we kept track of the time (PCX50A Discover, Perfectlight, Beijing). Thereafter, the gas in the bottle (0.5 mL) was drawn every 1 h to analyze the hydrogen content for a total of 5 h, which was also a hydrogen production cycle (gas chromatography Tianmei GC7900, TCD, 13× column, nitrogen as the carrier). Following each cycle, 20 mg EY was added, and the preceding processes were repeated, replacing the air in the bottle with N2, and repeating the hydrogen production process for 5 h.
2.3 Calculation of the apparent quantum yield
The apparent quantum yield (AQY) was measured using a xenon lamp with optical filters of different wavelengths as the light source. An optical power meter was used to determine the optical powder density (CEL-NP2000, Beijing Zhongjiao Jinyuan Technology, wavelength range within 420–550 nm). n(H2) represents the H2 evolution rate (mol h−1), NA represents the Avogadro constant (6.02 × 1023 mol−1), S represents the reaction system's light radiation area (cm2), I represents the optical power density (mW cm−2), λ represents the monochromatic wavelength (m), and t1 (h), t2 (s), h (W), and c (m s−1) are constants with values of 1, 3600, 6.63 × 10−34, and 3 × 108, respectively.9 (1)
2.4 Photoelectrochemical measurements
Ultrasonically scatter 10 mg of photocatalysts into 100 μL of Nafion–ethanol solution (1:9, volume ratio). To make a working electrode, the abovementioned suspension was uniformly coated on indium tin oxide (ITO) conductive glass (1 cm × 1 cm) drop by drop and dried. A Pt electrode and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) were used as the counter and reference electrodes, respectively, to form a three-electrode system. The transient photocurrent response (i–t, 0.2 V vs. SCE), electrochemical impedance (EIS, 0.2 V vs. SCE), linear sweep voltammetry curve (LSV, −0.6 V to 0 V vs. SCE) and Mott–Schottky plots (M–S, −1 V to 1 V vs. SCE) were obtained and the photoelectrochemical analyses were performed on an electrochemical workstation (VersaSTAT4-400, AMETEK) with a self-regulating standard three-electrode cell. A 300 W xenon lamp was used as the light source with a cut-off filter of 420 nm. The electrolyte solution was Na2SO4 solution (0.2 mol L−1).
2.5 Characterization
The tube voltage was 40 KV and the tube current was 40 mA (Rigaku RINT-2000, Cu Kα radiation, scan rate: 10° min−1) for the X-ray diffraction (XRD) study. The morphology and distribution of the material were examined using a field-emission scanning electron microscope (SEM) and energy dispersive spectrum (EDS) element mapping (ZEISS, SIGMA 500). A transmission electron microscope (TEM, Tecnai G2-TF30) was used with an accelerating voltage of 300 kV. X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out using an ESCALAB 250. Photoluminescence (PL) emission spectra and time-resolved PL (TRPL) spectra were obtained at room temperature using a FluoroMAX-4 spectrometer (Horiba, France) and an excitation wavelength of 480 nm. A UV-2550 (Shimadzu) spectrometer was used to obtain the UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectra (UV-vis DRS, using BaSO4 as the background reference). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) was performed at room temperature with an FTIR-650 Fourier transform infrared spectrometer. A Renishaw-2000 Raman spectrometer was used for the Raman spectroscopy.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 X-ray diffraction analysis
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of pure CuBr used in the GDY–CuBr preparation process to analyze the crystal composition is shown in Fig. 1a, which matches well with the cubic CuBr standard card JCPDS 6-292. The peaks at 27.21°, 45.08°, and 53.34° correspond to the crystal faces (111), (220), and (311), respectively. To obtain purer GDY, the composite GDY–CuBr was washed with ammonia water several times until the supernatant obtained by centrifugation was colorless and transparent, and then it was dried overnight. Fig. 1b displays the XRD pattern of GDY, GDY–CuBr, and CuBr for comparison of the crystal phase changes. When the XRD patterns of GDY and GDY–CuBr are compared, the difference between the two is negligible due to the low content of CuBr. However, the results of subsequent X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) strongly support the existence of CuBr.36 Furthermore, both GDY–CuBr and GDY exhibit an obvious broad peak at about 23°, which corresponds to the amorphous carbon (002) crystal plane.32,37,38 This result preliminarily confirmed the obtained material's characteristics as a carbon material. When CuI is used as the catalytic substrate for GDY growth, the resulting XRD pattern also shows a broad and obvious peak around 23°.
 Fig. 1  XRD patterns of (a) CuBr, and (b) GDY, GDY–CuBr, and CuBr. 
From the XRD pattern of pure CuI, GDY–CuI, and GDY(CI) which is shown in Fig. S1a and b (ESI†), it can be observed that the XRD characteristic peaks of the CuI sample used in the preparation process match well with the CuI standard card No. 75-832 of the cubic phase. The difference between GDY(CI) and GDY–CuI is also not obvious by comparing the XRD patterns that are shown in Fig. S1b (ESI†). This is consistent with the observation in Fig. 1b, which is also related to the low CuI content of the GDY–CuI composite.
3.2 Raman and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy
The obtained graphdiyne with the catalytic carrier of CuBr was characterized by Raman spectroscopy in order to identify sample uniformity and detect the presence of acetylene bonds. The Raman spectra of GDY (CB) show two significant peaks at 1362.5 cm−1 and 1588.2 cm−1, as shown in Fig. 2a. The peak at around 1362.5 cm−1 is caused by the breathing vibration of sp2 carbon domains in aromatic rings, which is attributed to the disordered D band associated with structural defects.39,40 The higher the intensity of the D band, the more crystal defects there are. In addition to the D band peak at 1362.5 cm−1, another peak around the G band at 1588.2 cm−1 corresponds to the first-order scattering of the E2g mode observed for in-phase stretching vibration sp2 carbon domains aromatic rings.41,42 According to the related calculations the intensity ratio of D/G is 0.626, indicating that the obtained GDY has a high order and low defects.43 Furthermore, the remaining two weak peaks at 1911.8 cm−1 and 2188.6 cm−1 could be attributed to the acetylene bond's stretching vibration.44–46 According to the previous work of Li et al., when the acetylene bond in GDY reacts with the metal ion, the characteristic peak of the acetylene bond becomes weak or even disappears.47 This could explain why the characteristic peaks of the acetylene bonds in GDY's Raman spectra of GDY are so weak. Besides, Fig. S2a (ESI†) shows the Raman spectra of GDY(CI), which has a similar peak position compared with GDY. Moreover, the intensity ratio of the D peak to the G peak is 0.636, indicating that its structure is reasonably ordered. What's more, the Raman spectrum of the composite GDY–CuI shown in the illustration exhibits a more obvious peak intensity at about 1918.2 cm−1 and 2170.6 cm−1. This result provides more substantial evidence for the successful synthesis of GDY in addition to the XRD result.
 Fig. 2  Raman pattern of (a) GDY, and FT-IR spectra of (b) GDY and GDY–CuBr. 
In addition to Raman spectra, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) is a technique commonly used to study structure and chemical bonds, and it can be used to detect benzene rings and acetylene bonds in the graphdiyne structure. In Fig. 2b, the FT-IR spectra of GDY–CuBr and GDY show adsorption peaks of the GDY benzene ring at 1447 cm−1 and 1594 cm−1. Moreover, the other peaks at 2203 cm−1 and 2205 cm−1 correspond to the acetylene bond stretching vibration peak.48,49 Besides, the peak at 2352 cm−1 is associated with the vibration of the CO bond in the CO2 molecule.31 The FT-IR spectrum of the GDY-CuI composite synthesized with CuI as the catalytic substrate showed similar peak positions, as shown in Fig. S2b (ESI†). Peaks related to the absorption peak of the graphdiyne benzene ring can also be detected at 1445 cm−1 and 1591 cm−1. Furthermore, the weaker peaks at 2160 cm−1 and 2206 cm−1 were related to the stretching vibration peak of the alkyne bond, while the stretching vibration of –CH2– caused the peak at 2908 cm−1.
3.3 Morphological characteristics analysis
The scanning electron microscope (SEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM) characteristic tests were performed to investigate the morphological properties of GDY–CuBr.50 The SEM images of GDY–CuBr in Fig. 3a and b show that its primary morphology is lamellar. The information shown in Fig. 3b can more clearly observe the structure of this terraced layer-by-layer stack. Due to the relatively low proportion of CuBr in the composite catalyst GDY–CuBr, the SEM results show no apparent presence of CuBr. Unlike the SEM images, the TEM images distinguished GDY and CuBr well, as shown in Fig. 3c and d. The prominent dark dot-like regions of CuBr could be seen in the TEM image of GDY–CuBr in Fig. 3c. The lighter-colored areas that remain are associated with GDY membranes. This membrane-like structure becomes more visible as the magnification increases, as shown in the blue area of Fig. 3d. The inset in Fig. 3d is an enlarged view of the blue area, and this clear membrane-like structure belonging to GDY can be seen more clearly at the edge of the selected area.51 The dark shadows in the central area, with the exception of the edges, may be caused by the stacking of membrane-like GDY and CuBr particles. Fig. 3e displays the high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) image of GDY–CuBr. The lattice fringes detected in Fig. 3e with interlayer spacings of 0.201 nm and 0.327 nm belong to the (220) and (111) crystal planes of CuBr, respectively. Furthermore, a large area without any discernible lattice fringes can be observed, which is related to GDY. In Fig. 3f, the lattice fringes with lattice spacings of 0.201 nm and 0.327 nm belong to the CuBr crystal planes of (220) and (111), respectively. It is worth noting the regions where the CuBr lattice fringes intersect with the amorphous regions. The contact interface between CuBr and GDY shown in Fig. 3e and f illustrates the successful recombination. Moreover, as shown in Fig. 3e and f, the CuBr lattice fringes are relatively weak. This phenomenon could be attributed to the low content of CuBr used as a catalytic substrate during the synthesis process.52 Additionally, Fig. 3g shows the EDX image of GDY–CuBr, which clearly shows the presence of C, Cu, Br, and O elements. Furthermore, the same result can also be obtained in the EDS element mapping images of GDY–CuBr, as shown in Fig. 3h, which further confirms the successful preparation when compared to the XRD characterization.53

3.4 X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis
In addition to analyzing the surface chemical state and chemical composition of the samples, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) can also be used to analyze the surface elements of the sample semi-quantitatively. As a result, XPS can be used to quantitatively analyze the carbon bonding mode in the obtained samples. Fig. 4a–c display the survey spectra of GDY, GDY–CuBr, and GDY–CuI, respectively. The presence of C, O, Cu, Br, and I elements can be seen in the survey spectra of GDY–CuBr and GDY–CuI. Moreover, the O element is caused by the adsorption of air during the test.54 Additionally, the XRD comparison results revealed that after washing the obtained sample with ammonia water to remove CuBr and CuI, the XRD pattern of the sample did not appear to be significantly different due to the low content. These differences can be seen in the XPS results of GDY–CuBr and GDY. The peaks belonging to Cu and Br are significantly weakened in the XPS spectra of GDY in Fig. 4a when compared to the XPS spectra of GDY–CuBr in Fig. 4b. This weakening is most noticeable in the Br 3d peak in the range of 60–80 eV. This obvious comparison emphasizes the importance of aqueous ammonia treatment.32
 Fig. 4  XPS spectra of (a) survey spectra GDY, (b) GDY–CuBr, (c) GDY–CuI, fine spectrum of (d–f) C 1s in GDY, GDY–CuBr, GDY–CuI, (g) Cu 2p in GDY–CuBr and GDY–CuI, (h) Br 3d in GDY–CuBr, and (i) I 3d in GDY–CuI. 
The fine spectrum of C 1s of GDY, GDY–CuBr, and GDY–CuI is shown in Fig. 4d–f, respectively. The C 1s peak can be mainly fitted into four sub-peaks after subtracting a linear background and fitting it with a Lorentzian and Gaussian mixture function. The four peaks in GDY's C 1s XPS spectra at 284.37 eV, 285.05 eV, 286.20 eV, and 288.15 eV correspond to a C 1s orbital of C–C (sp2), C–C (sp), C–O, and CO, respectively.41,55 Besides, the area ratio of the peaks appearing at 284.37 eV to 285.05 eV is approximately 1/2 (sp/sp2 = 2), which is consistent with the C–C (sp) and C–C (sp2) ratios in this structure.35 The remaining two peaks, C–O and CO, are caused by additional alkyne units between the benzene rings in the graphdiyne, which increases the network pore size, and the sample is exposed to the air during the test process to adsorb oxygen.18,45 The C 1s fine spectra of GDY–CuBr and GDY–CuI can also be fitted to four peaks after subtracting the linear background. The peaks at 284.44 eV, 285.02 eV, 286.27 eV, and 288.05 eV were assigned to C–C (sp2), C–C (sp), C–O, and CO, respectively. In Fig. 4f, the peaks for C–C (sp2), C–C (sp), C–O, and CO appear at 284.34 eV, 284.90 eV, 286.12 eV, and 288.02 eV, respectively. It is worth mentioning that the ratio of the peak areas belonging to sp and sp2 is roughly equal to 2 in both GDY–CuBr and the C 1s spectrum of GDY–CuI. This result is consistent with the XPS results of GDY.

Fig. 4g exhibits the fine spectrum of Cu 2p in GDY–CuBr and GDY–CuI. The XPS results revealed that the chemical state of Cu in GDY–CuBr is more complex than in GDY–CuI. After deducting the linear background, the Cu 2p spectra in GDY–CuI can be fit into two peaks at 932.92 eV and 952.71 eV, which can be attributed to Cu 2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2.50,56 The peak positions of the fitted curve obtained after subtracting the linear background for GDY–CuBr are 933.07 eV, 934.9 eV, 940.46 eV, 944.57 eV, 952. 98 eV, 955.3 eV, and 963.22 eV. The main XPS peak at 934.9 eV and satellite peaks at 955.3 eV and 963.22 eV correspond to Cu2+ formation, while the main XPS peak at 933.07 eV and satellite peak at 952.98 eV are related to Cu+.57 Besides, the remaining two peaks at 940.46 eV and 944.57 eV are attributed to satellite peaks caused by Cu2+ formation.58,59 The prominent and satellite peaks of Cu2+ and Cu+ in the Cu 2p XPS spectra of GDY–CuBr indicate the formation of a mixture of Cu2+ and Cu+. Furthermore, when compared to the prominent peak of Cu 2p in GDY–CuI, the peak in GDY–CuBr exhibits a 0.15–0.35 eV shift toward a higher binding energy. This result illustrates that with a loss of electrons, the Cu+ can be converted to high-charge Cu2+.60 The charge effect is responsible for the shift of the peak to higher or lower binding energy. Fig. 4h exhibits the fine spectrum of Br 3d in GDY–CuBr. It can be seen from the figure that the central peak positions of Br 3d located at 68.50 eV and 70.59 eV are related to Br 3d5/2 and Br 3d3/2.61 The fine spectrum of I 3d in GDY–CuI is shown in Fig. 4i, where two prominent peaks appear at 619.35 eV and 631.05 eV, respectively, and are related to I 3d5/2 (619.35 eV) and I 3d3/2 (631.05 eV), respectively.62
3.5 UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectrum
One of the requirements for photocatalytic semiconductor materials to possess hydrogen evolution performance is excellent visible light adsorption capacity. Ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflection (UV-vis DRS) is such a characterization method that can detect light absorption performance. As shown in Fig. 5a, the absorbance of GDY–CuBr is higher than CuBr and GDY in the wavelength range of 250–1200 nm. This result demonstrates that the presence of CuBr is beneficial to the improvement of hydrogen evolution performance. The band gaps of GDY, GDY–CuBr, and CuBr can be estimated using the Kubelka–Munk method as 0.64 eV, 0.75 eV, and 2.85 eV in Fig. 5b, respectively.63,64 Notably, theoretical calculations show that the bandgap width of graphdiyne is in the range of 0.44 to 1.47 eV.23,65,66 These studies provide us with essential reference data for estimating the GDY bandgap. Furthermore, the presence of CuBr extends the bandgap of GDY–CuBr (0.75 eV) significantly compared to GDY (0.64 eV). The extended band gap is beneficial to suppress the secondary recombination of electrons and holes, thereby increasing the utilization of photogenerated electrons.

3.6 Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution kinetics
The superiority of hydrogen evolution activity is the focus of research on photocatalytic hydrogen production. Using EY as the sensitizer and TEOA as the sacrificial reagent, the hydrogen production activity of the obtained samples was measured. Fig. 6a compares the hydrogen production activity of GDY, CuBr, and GDY–CuBr. In 5 h, the hydrogen production activity of GDY, CuBr, and GDY–CuBr was 119.91 μmol h−1 g−1, 457.32 μmol h−1 g−1, and 1452.19 μmol h−1 g−1, respectively. When compared to pure GDY, the hydrogen evolution performance of the composite GDY–CuBr was nearly 12 times higher and 3 times higher than CuBr. Fig. 6b depicts the hydrogen production activity of the composite GDY–CuI prepared with CuI as the catalytic substrate. Under the same conditions, the hydrogen evolution capacities of CuI and, GDY–CuI were 605.98 μmol h−1 g−1 and 887.63 μmol h−1 g−1, respectively. GDY–CuI does not outperform GDY–CuBr in terms of hydrogen production activity. When comparing the hydrogen production results of CuBr and GDY–CuBr, whether the catalytic substrate is CuI or CuBr, GDY is able to improve the hydrogen production activity. Overall, the improvement effect is greater when CuBr is used as the catalytic substrate. As a comparison, the hydrogen production effect of this system was determined when only EY was added. Moreover, the hydrogen production effect of EY is feeble (5.8 μmol), which could be due to degrades and the inability to effectively utilize electrons, resulting in suppression of the hydrogen production environment.32 Undoubtedly, this result confirms the catalyst's indispensable role in this system. Graphdiyne's particular two-dimensional planar network and pore structure help in the adsorption of EY molecules, injecting more hydrogen production power into the reaction.

Fig. 6d displays the apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of hydrogen production when using GDY–CuBr. The highest AQE of 5.86% is obtained at 550 nm for GDY–CuBr. Except for the ultraviolet band (420–450 nm), the AQE of GDY–CuBr shows similar values at 470 nm, 500 nm, and 520 nm, consistent with its light absorption capacity. Furthermore, when comparing the hydrogen production performance of GDY–CuBr with other systems reported in the literature of the same type, GDY–CuBr has prominent superior hydrogen evolution activity.67,68 As shown in Table 2, the comparison results demonstrate that the hydrogen evolution of GDY–CuBr has a higher performance than previously reported literature. This result indicates the great potential of GDY–CuBr in the field of photocatalysis.

Moreover, to explore the existing form of Cu ions in the system after the reaction, we recorded the color change and displays in Fig. S3 (ESI†). Excluding the effect of EY on the color of the solution, Fig. S3 (ESI†) depicts the color change of the reaction solution when only the TEOA sacrificial reagent was added. After a 5 h illumination experiment, the TEOA solution in the reaction flask containing CuBr and CuI turned blue. This result roughly verifies the existence of hydrated copper ions [Cu(H2O)4]2+. The transition from Cu+ to Cu2+ is beneficial to the hydrogen evolution process.69,70
In addition to the hydrogen production activity, stability is another criterion worth exploring for evaluating the pros and cons of photocatalysts. Fig. 7a shows the cycle stability test results of GDY–CuBr and pure CuBr. At the beginning of each cycle, 20 mg of fresh EY has been added again. After 4 cycles of the hydrogen production process (20 h) and a 10 h standing process, the hydrogen production activity of the composite GDY–CuBr and CuBr decreased to varying degrees. The final hydrogen production activity of GDY–CuBr was reduced to 60% of the initial cycle (from 1722 to 1045 μmol h−1 g−1), and that of pure CuBr dropped sharply to 26% of the initial value (from 604 to 157 μmol h−1 g−1). This result shows that the composite GDY–CuBr has better cyclic stability than CuBr, and can withstand a longer-term continuous reaction. Moreover, it can be observed from Fig. 7b that the used GDY–CuBr still maintains a good characteristic peak at about 23° by comparing the XRD pattern of GDY–CuBr before and after hydrogen production. This result shows that the composite can still maintain the original crystal structure characteristics after a long period of continuous hydrogen production.36 By collecting the samples after hydrogen production and repeating the hydrogen evolution test, it can be found that GDY–CuBr still maintains the initial hydrogen production activity (inset of Fig. 7b).

A comparison of the survey XPS spectrum of GDY–CuBr before and after hydrogen production is shown in Fig. 7c. Fig. 7d–f show the fine spectra of C, Br, and Cu in turn. Because CuBr has the characteristics of being slightly soluble in water, the characteristic peak intensity of Cu and Br of GDY–CuBr participating in the hydrogen evolution reaction has decreased. The fine spectrum of C 1s in Fig. 7d was subjected to peak splitting processing, and it was found that the binding energy related to the C–C (sp), C–C (sp2), C–O, and CO in the used GDY–CuBr did not show obvious shift changes. Except for the fine spectrum of C 1s, the spectrum of Br 3d in Fig. 7e shows a relatively obvious change. Comparing the fine spectra of fresh and used Cu 2p in Fig. 7f, it can be found that the binding energy has also not shown an apparent change that is worth exploring. But its background baseline becomes rougher, which shows that its mass percent has reduced relatively. The changes in the XPS spectrum of Br 3d and Cu 2p after hydrogen production may be due to the fact that part of the CuBr decomposed due to light after a long hydrogen production cycle process.
3.7 Photoluminescence and time-resolved photoluminescence spectra
The recombination rate of photogenerated electron–hole pairs is one of the main factors affecting electron utilization. Furthermore, the peak intensity of the fluorescence spectrum can reflect the degree of electron–hole recombination.50,52 Correspondingly, a decrease in peak intensity means a decrease in the recombination ratio of electrons and holes, and it also means an increase in separation efficiency.71Fig. 8a displays the photoluminescence spectra of pure EY, GDY, and GDY–CuBr under the excitation wavelength of 480 nm. When GDY and GDY–CuBr are added into the EY solution, the fluorescence intensity of the peak at 540 nm decreases significantly. This phenomenon shows that the electron–hole recombination in the system is effectively suppressed with the introduction of GDY or GDY–CuBr, and the effect of GDY–CuBr is more significant than pure GDY. Moreover, as shown in Fig. S4a (ESI†), the PL intensity of GDY–CuI is higher than that of GDY–CuBr, and this result illustrates that GDY–CuBr has a greater ability to inhibit the secondary recombination of electrons and holes.
 Fig. 8  (a) Photoluminescence spectroscopy of EY, GDY, and GDY–CuBr. (b) Time-resolved photoluminescence spectra of EY and GDY–CuBr. 
Besides, in order to further understand the intrinsic connection between EY and the introduced catalyst, Fig. 8b exhibits the time-resolved photoluminescence spectra of EY and EY in the presence of GDY–CuBr under the excitation wavelength of 454 nm. The corresponding data about the fluorescence quenching behaviors for EY are shown in Table 3. To better explore the internal reasons why the hydrogen production activity of GDY–CuBr is better than GDY–CuI, Fig. S4b and Table S1 (ESI†) additionally supplement the relevant data of GDY-CuI. As for pure EY in the TEOA solution, the data could be described via single index fluorescence decay dynamics. Unlike the single-stage fitting of pure EY, with the introduction of GDY–CuBr in this system, the obtained data can be described by double exponential fluorescence decay kinetics.72 The related equation is shown below (2). (2)I represents the normalized emission intensity; Bi represents the amplitude (pre-exponential factor); t represents the time after the pulsed laser excitation; τi represents the respective TRPL decay lifetime.

The average lifetime was calculated using the followed formula (3): (3)where τav is the average lifetime, Bi is the amplitude (pre-exponential factor), amd τi is the TRPL decay time.
In the presence of only EY, the single-stage exponential fitting shows that there is only one kind of luminescent substance under the excitation conditions with a lifetime of 0.21 ns. GDY–CuBr shows faster decay kinetics (τav = 0.17 ns) compared to EY (τav = 0.21 ns) and GDY–CuI (τav = 0.20 ns), which indicates faster photogenic electron transfer.73
3.8 Electrochemical characterization test
The transient photocurrent response curve, as shown in Fig. 8a, reflects the separation properties of photocatalyst photogenerated electrons and holes. The higher photocurrent intensity means better separation efficiency of electrons and holes.37 The response level of GDY–CuBr is noticeably higher than GDY, indicating that GDY–CuBr has a higher separation efficiency of photogenerated e−–h+ pairs. The rapid separation ability of photogenerated electron–hole pairs allows for more efficient use of electrons, which is beneficial to hydrogen production reactions. Besides, Fig. 9b displays the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of GDY and GDY–CuBr to compare the resistance during the charge transfer process. The EIS curve of GDY–CuBr has a smaller arc radius than GDY, indicating the lower charge transfer resistance, and better separation ability of the photogenerated e−–h+ pairs.53,54 Fig. S5a (ESI†) shows that the EIS curves of GDY–CuI have a larger arc radius than those for GDY–CuBr, which demonstrates that GDY–CuBr possesses a superior charge transfer ability. The hydrogen evolution overpotentials of GDY and GDY–CuBr were investigated using linear sweep voltammograms (LSV). GDY–CuBr exhibits the smallest overpotential under the same current density, as shown in Fig. 9c. In addition to this, after comparing GDY–CuI and CuI in Fig. S5b (ESI†), GDY–CuBr is found to have an advantage. This result illustrates that, under the same conditions, the hydrogen production reaction of GDY–CuBr requires less driving force and can more easily produce hydrogen.37,72

To confirm the semiconductor type, Fig. 9(d–f) show the Mott–Schottky curves of GDY, CuBr, and GDY–CuBr at frequencies of 1000 Hz, 2000 Hz, and 3000 Hz, respectively. From Fig. 9d it can be seen that GDY shows a positive slope in the E–C−2 plots, which is typical of n-type semiconductors. CuBr exhibits the inverse characteristic which belongs to p-type semiconductors, as shown in Fig. 9e. As a result, a p–n heterojunction structure may form between the CuBr and GDY. Furthermore, the flat band potential (Efb) of the GDY and CuBr could be estimated as −0.52 V vs. SCE and 2.08 V vs. SCE by the tangent to the axis of Y = 0. For n-type semiconductors, the conduction band (ECB) position is 0.1 or 0.2 V lower than the resulting flat band potential. Besides, the valence band (EVB) position of the p-type semiconductor is 0.1 or 0.2 V higher than the flat band potential.74 Thus, the ECB of GDY, and the EVB of CuBr could be calculated to be −0.72 and 2.08 V vs. SCE, respectively. The formula of ENHE = ESCE + 0.241 V further converts the saturated calomel electrode to the normal hydrogen electrode. The ECB of GDY and EVB of CuBr can be calculated as −0.48 and 2.52 V vs. NHE, respectively. Furthermore, the EVB of GDY and ECB of CuBr could be further calculated as 0.16 and −0.35 V vs. NHE via the EVB = ECB + Eg equation. It is worth noting that the Mott–Schottky curve of the composite GDY–CuBr with an obvious inverted “V-shaped” is shown in Fig. 9f. This result indicates that the composite of GDY–CuBr has both p-type and n-type semiconductor properties, confirming the formation of the p–n heterojunction between CuBr and GDY.50 More importantly, the GDY–CuBr shows a negative shift in flat band potential than pure CuBr (2.08–1.18 V), and a positive shift compared to GDY (−0.52–0.50 V), which illustrates that the Fermi level of p-type CuBr shifts upward while that of the n-type GDY shifts downward along with the energy bands in the hybrid material. The above analysis could indicate that the p–n heterojunction between CuBr and GDY was successfully constructed.
3.9 Possible mechanism
Based on the above characterization results, a possible hydrogen production mechanism for the GDY–CuBr system is proposed in Fig. 10. The preliminary results of Fig. 8d and e indicate that the semiconductor types of GDY and CuBr are n-type semiconductor and p-type semiconductor, respectively. Specifically, an effective p–n heterojunction is established between CuBr and GDY. The Fermi level is close to the conduction band in n-type semiconductors, and close to the valence band in p-type semiconductors.53,75 Before being exposed to light, the electrons on GDY near the p-n interface tend to diffuse into the CuBr, resulting in a positively charged species. Meanwhile, the flow of holes is the inverse of that of electrons, which is diffused from CuBr to GDY and left a negatively charged species. This relative diffusion of electrons and holes will continue until the Fermi levels of n-type GDY and p-type CuBr are at the same level. In addition, these diffuse electron–hole pairs cause the formation of a built-in electric field. Following light irradiation, photoinduced electrons and holes in CuBr and GDY will migrate to the CB of GDY and the VB of CuBr, respectively, under the influence of an internal electric field. Furthermore, the EY molecules will be transformed into a singlet excited state EY1*, and then into a more stable triplet excited state EY3* through an inter-system transition (ISC). EY3* will be reduced and quenched by TEOA into EY−˙ with a strong reducing ability. After injecting electrons into the surface of GDY–CuBr in the hydrogen production reaction to participate in H2 evolution, EY−˙ returns to the ground state. The construction of the p–n heterojunction effectively accelerates the electron–hole separation efficiency in the GDY–CuBr system due to the synergy between the internal electric field and the band arrangement.76–78 A faster electron–hole separation rate can energize the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution process. Additionally, because of the unique pore structure of GDY, it is easier for the system to adsorb EY molecules on the surface. Improved charge transferability and a reduced electron–hole recombination rate are critical reasons for increasing the GDY–CuBr system's hydrogen production capability.

4. Conclusion
Rather than using copper foil or CuI as the catalytic substrate, the complete synthesis of GDY was carried out in this work based on CuBr powder as the catalytic substrate via the cross-coupling reaction. Because CuBr is soluble in ammonia, pure GDY can be obtained by washing the GDY–CuBr several times with ammonia water to remove CuBr. For cuprous halides, this work demonstrates the feasibility of using CuBr as a catalytic substrate in addition to CuI. The charge transfer rate of the EY sensitized GDY–CuBr system is effectively improved as a result of the construction of the p–n heterojunction between CuBr and GDY. As a result, GDY–CuBr showed surprising photocatalytic water decomposition activity to produce hydrogen compared with GDY–CuI. This work provides a new reference for the synthesis and application of GDY in the field of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution.
