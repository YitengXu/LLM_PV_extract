The rechargeable battery technology, as one of the attractive energy storage technologies integrating renewable resources, is experiencing unprecedented rapid development.

1. Introduction
Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) exist in most portable electronic devices due to their excellent electrochemical properties. In addition, LIBs power electric vehicles and store energy from renewable solar and wind sources.1–4 In recent years, with the widespread use of electric vehicles, the demand for lithium (Li) resources has increased rapidly (Fig. 1a).5–7 The demand for Li is expected to grow further in the near future, reaching 900000 tonnes per annum by 2025 (three times higher than in 2018), and its price will continue to rise.8–10 Therefore, efficient open Li resources have become a current research hotspot.11–13 Throughout the world, Li resources are mainly divided into ore sources and brine sources, which can be obtained by traditional metallurgical methods.14,15 However, these traditional extraction methods will cause environmental pollution and a lack of resources and are not sustainable preparation technologies. According to Tarascon et al.'s calculations, 2 tons of Li can be extracted from 28 tons of waste Li, which compares favorably with the consumption of traditional Li resources such as 250 tons of minerals or 750 tons of brine per ton of Li.16 Therefore, recycling used rechargeable batteries is highly desirable and beneficial from both economic and environmental points of view.17,18

With the increasing demand for Li in automotive applications, recycling is expected to play an important role in evaluating the future viability of Li for pure electric vehicle (PEV) production (Fig. 1a).19,20 As the demand for PEVs will increase in the coming years, along with LIBs, the recycling of LIBs will become critical. Since the first Li-ion automotive battery recycling company started operations in the United States in 2015, seven other companies located in Canada and the United States had started recycling or intended to start recycling Li metal and LIBs by 2020.21–23 The content of Li in spent LIBs is significantly higher than that in seawater or minerals.24,25 They are considered to be the most promising secondary Li resources to meet global demand for Li in the near future. The development and recovery of secondary Li resources are urgent needs to meet the growing demand. The recycling process of used LIBs mainly includes reuse, repair and recycling (Fig. 1c).26–28 Among them, the recycling process has attracted much attention. Recently, a lot of research has been done on the recycling of used batteries, taking advantage of the characteristics of high recycling efficiency, simple operation, low cost, and no pollution.
There are a number of waste Li recovery technologies based on pyrometallurgical/hydrometallurgical processes.31,32 The hydrometallurgical process is the most common one. Pyrometallurgical and hydrometallurgical processes are commonly used commercially to recover Li metal.33–35 Pyrometallurgy usually requires high energy consumption and emits harmful gases to pollute the environment.36–38 The hydrometallurgical process has the advantages of a high metal recovery rate, high product purity, low energy consumption, and low gas emission, and is considered to be the best method for LIB recycling.39–41 In addition, some emerging technologies (such as electrochemical technology and microbial technology) are also developing towards efficient waste Li recovery.42,43 The impact of spent LIB recycling on the environment is an important index to evaluate the recycling method. According to our research, there have been few reviews that mentioned how different types of spent LIB recycling methods impact the environment, although it's a necessity. We propose a new evaluation system to evaluate the greenness of different recycling methods, 3E (efficiency), 3R (recovery), and 3S (safety) systems, which will be further mentioned in the conclusion.
In this review, we introduce pretreatment, pyrometallurgy, and hydrometallurgy techniques, guided by the most widely used conventional LIB recycling processes. An in-depth analysis of these recycling technologies is carried out based on the principles, while the recently developed representative emerging green recycling technologies are discussed in detail (Fig. 2). We also propose a new evaluation system to evaluate the environmental indicators of different recycling methods. In addition, based on the comparative analysis of the existing problems in the existing technology, the prospect and direction of the recycling of waste Li are put forward. Finally, the challenges and opportunities for batteries recycling in the future are discussed.

2. Pretreatment
The pretreatment process is aimed at improving the recycling efficiency of spent LIBs, so that it can better meet the standards of efficiency, economy and environmental protection. The pretreatment process can be roughly divided into two steps, namely, the disassembling of batteries and the separation of active materials (Fig. 3a).47,48 The separation process of active materials could be different according to the difference in the methods of battery disassembly. Manual and robot disassembly can have a clear separation of each part of the battery, followed by a dissolution process and thermal treatment process.50,52 Due to the complex connection structure among the components of LIBs, if pyrometallurgy or hydrometallurgy is directly carried out without pretreatment, the recycling efficiency for the high-value metals in spent LIBs will be greatly reduced (Fig. 3b).53 Different from ordinary batteries, discarded LIBs have some trapped Li in their anodes, which is embedded during the overcharging process, and are prone to explode when exposed to strong mechanical action in air. Besides, even when spent LIBs have reached the limit of their life, there is still a certain amount of energy in them, which increases the danger in the subsequent processing.54,55 Thus, the process of discharging batteries before pretreatment is necessary.56

2.1 Disassembly process
The metal and plastic shell of the battery can be removed to separate the active materials and other substances of the battery. The disassembly process can be carried out manually or automatically by a machine.52 Using robots to decompose large batteries can greatly reduce the risk of manual operation. Moreover, the operation in the form of an automatic assembly line can greatly improve the efficiency of battery recycling and reduce the cost of human resources (Fig. 3c).50 Another common method is mechanical crushing. The method is more direct and violent than the manual method, usually using a hammer mill, blade crusher, granulator etc. to destroy the battery structure and smashing them to pieces.57 In the process of mechanical crushing, due to the mechanical action of various kinds of friction and impact, the temperature of the material can reach as high as 300 °C.58 And, the short circuit of the pieces of the anode and cathode will release certain energy. These combined actions make the flammable electrolytes turn into a variety of toxic gases and cause pollution to the environment.59,60 Given the toxic gases produced at high temperature, an effective way to reduce toxic emission by performing the crushing process in a salt solution is proposed. Crushing in 10 wt% NaCl solution can limit the VOCs that may be generated and released, which greatly reduces the emission of toxic gases.51 In addition, the method of crushing in an inert gas environment is also often used, which can reduce the explosion danger caused by flammable substances and increase the safety (Fig. 3d).49 Mechanical crushing, as a commonly used method in industry, can rapidly process a large number of materials.
2.2 Separation of active materials
After manual disassembly or mechanical disassembly, the separation methods of active materials can be roughly divided into mechanical separation, solvent treatment, thermal treatment and mechanical treatment.

2.2.1 Mechanical separation. 
Mechanical separation is a method to separate materials by using the physical properties of different materials in the battery, such as wettability, density, magnetism and conductivity.61 There is a need to use a screen or centrifuge to assist classification (Fig. 4a).62–64 When using wettability to separate different components, the surface treatment of the crushed material is required to help improve the surface properties of the active material.65,66 After the complex LIB structure is crushed, the metal, organic matter and inorganic matter usually permeate each other, which makes it an obstacle to completely separate them through a simple mechanical process. Therefore, in most instances, more than one separation method will be used (Fig. 4b).67 Mechanical separation has the advantage of being able to separate different components with little or no solvent and without producing toxic by-products, making it a green separation process.

2.2.2 Thermal treatment. 
Thermal treatment separation is a process that completely removes organic matter in the battery by calcination at a certain temperature (Fig. 4c).68 After thermal treatment, the active material will be easier to separate from the current collector. The control of the calcination temperature is closely related to the quality of the material. Too low temperature will lead to incomplete removal of organic matter, while too high temperature will generate a metal oxide layer on the surface of the active material, which is detrimental to subsequent purification.70 Thermal treatment is a simple way to purify the active materials on a large scale. However, during the process of calcination, many toxic gases will be produced due to the decomposition of various organic matter, which will certainly pollute the environment without decontamination. Thus, the corresponding waste gas treatment equipment is needed, which will increase the processing cost to some extent. In addition, calcination needs to be carried out at high temperature, and the energy consumption is a nonnegligible factor (Fig. 4d).32,69 In order to reduce the generation of toxic gas during the heat treatment, vacuum pyrolysis method can greatly reduce the adhesion between the collector and the active material, make the separation of the active material easier, reduce the generation of toxic gas and improve the efficiency of the subsequent leaching process.32


2.2.3 Solvent dissolution treatment. 
The solvent dissolution method is a simple and effective method to separate active materials by dissolving binders and other organics. N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP) has a good solubility to PVDF (Fig. 5a).71,72 Thus the dissolution process of LIBs is usually conducted in a 100 °C heated NMP solution.73 After treatment, the separated Al foil can be recycled in the form of metal, and the high-value metals in the active materials are purified. Meanwhile the high price of NMP makes it hard to use in industry.74 Therefore, many other organic solutions are invented to act as a substitute for NMP, such as dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), N,N-dimethylacetamide(DMAC), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), etc.75–77

Although solvent dissolution treatment can enable good separation of the active materials and the collectors, it also has its limit. The organic solvent used is quite expensive and not suitable for large-scale industrial production. Besides, the solvent treatment can't remove all the impurities on the surface of active materials and further treatment is needed (Fig. 5b).78–80


2.2.4 Mechanochemical treatment. 
The mechanochemical method in the pretreatment process is to induce physical and chemical changes of LIBs by applying a load to make LIBs stressed or fractured.82,83 High energy milling is the best method to provide external mechanical force in this process, and many machines such as a vibration mill, planetary mill, ball mill, etc. are applied (Fig. 5c).81,84 Mechanochemical treatment can enhance the recovery efficiency of LIBs in two aspects. Firstly, the leaching efficiency of LIBs at room temperature is improved by destroying its original crystal structure and increasing its surface area through reducing the size of LIBs. Secondly, an environment is provided for LIB pieces to react with other materials to produce soluble substances.85,86 Mechanochemical treatment can make more high-value metals dissolve in the solvent so as to make the purification process convenient. In addition, it has a high solvent utilization rate, low environmental pollution and high energy utilization rate.87,88
Pretreatment plays an important role in the recovery of spent LIBs. Through pretreatment, the active material and electrolyte in the raw materials of LIBs can be concentrated and preliminarily purified, which provides convenience for the subsequent hydrometallurgy and pyrometallurgy process.

3. Pyrometallurgy technology
Pyrometallurgy was originally used to smelt minerals, using high temperature to induce the physical and chemical transformation of ores, so as to purify the metal element inside.89,90 As development, Pyrometallurgy is gradually used in the recovery of various kinds of batteries, and now it is widely used in the recovery of spent LIBs (Fig. 6a). As a method of recycling spent LIBs at high temperature, the high efficiency and high safety of pyrometallurgy earn it much attention. The method of pyrometallurgy can be roughly divided into direct roasting, atmosphere-assisted roasting and salt-assisted roasting.

3.1 Direct roasting
The process of direct roasting can be divided into three steps. First, organic components such as electrolytes are decomposed by heating at low temperatures (500–550 °C). This is to prevent the organics from being vaporized too fast causing an explosion.91 The second step is high-temperature melting. Plastics, binders, electrolytes and other organic compounds in LIBs are burned and decomposed at high temperature to provide part of the energy in the process. Al and C in the battery act as reducing agents to reduce Co and Ni metal oxides to metal (Fig. 6b). The CaO–SiO2–Al2O3 system is usually used to oxidize the low valence metal and ensure that the high valence metal can be separated as an alloy at the bottom of the furnace.93 In this process, Al turns into Al2O3 through a thermite reaction process and releases a large amount of energy, and Al2O3 is incorporated into the slag phase.91,93,94 High-value metals such as Ni and Co are formed as molten metals or alloys. In the third step, after high temperature treatment, the molten alloy phase formed by reducing Co, Ni and other metals is separated at the bottom of the furnace, and further separation of the alloy can be performed by hydrometallurgy (Fig. 6b). However, metals such as Li and Mn, which cannot be reduced in this process, are deserted in the slag phase in the form of oxides.95 The hydrometallurgical process is necessary if further recovery of metal from slag is to be achieved. Recently, lab-scale Li metal extraction from slag has made some progress, and the leaching rate of Li can reach 90%.96,97
This process which involves melting and reduction as the core steps is also known as direct roasting.98 This process only focuses on the recovery of high-value metals such as Ni and Co and does not focus on the recovery of other components of the battery. Direct roasting allows simultaneous recycling of batteries with different components without the need for pre-treatment (Fig. 6c). Direct roasting allows for the presence of other impurities in the feedstock of spent LIBs, because the impurity components can be broken down into gases at high temperatures or remain in the slag phase, which is convenient for simultaneous processing of a large number of unclassified spent LIBs.37,99 The whole process is carried out at high temperature with the participation of a reducing agent, and all the risks are concentrated in the processing process. Through the gradient heating method, the risk of explosion can be further reduced. Besides, the process of direct roasting is relatively short, making it easy to operate and produce on a large scale.100 However there are many disadvantages, including: high energy consumption; spent LIBs cannot be recycled efficiently (more than 50%); more toxic gases (dioxins and fluoride) are produced, etc. and to solve these problems further selective leaching treatments are applied. Wang et al. used the in situ reduction roasting method to recycle the LiCoO2 cathode material, and its selective leaching efficiencies in NaOH solution reached 93.67% (Li) and 95.59% (Al), respectively (Fig. 6c). In addition, the leaching residue can be completely dissolved in H2SO4 solution, making the recovery process simpler and more efficient.92
Although direct roasting is a simple and efficient means to recover high-value metals such as Co, Ni, etc.,89 its disadvantages are quite obvious. In order to solve these problems, atmosphere-assisted roasting and salt-assisted roasting are proposed.
3.2 Atmosphere-assisted roasting
Atmosphere-assisted roasting is carried out in the absence of oxygen, which reduces the waste gas produced by the side reaction and the partial pressure of the product gas.46,101 With the help of the atmosphere, the reduction temperature of the active materials can be reduced, allowing the reduction process to take place at a lower temperature.102 In addition, with the help of a reducing agent such as Al and C, Li can be recovered in the form of Li2CO3, which is soluble in aqueous. The leaching rate of Li obtained by Liu et al. based on alkali roasting was close to 100%, and the recovered graphite had properties comparable to those of commercial graphite. This method gives a good solution to the problem of Li recycling and the waste of anode graphite during the direct roasting process (Fig. 7a).103 Atmosphere-assisted roasting has been widely studied on a laboratory scale, for example, using graphite as the reducing agent to heat LiCoO2 at 1000 °C under the protection of N2, Li2CoO2 can be decomposed into Co and Li2CO3 and the subsequent recovery of Co and Li can reach as high as 95%.46,104 This method can also be used for cathode materials with multiple high-value metals such as LiNiCoAlO2 (NCA). Using Ar as the protective gas and treating at 650 °C, NCA can be well decomposed. After the subsequent leaching process, the recovery rate of Ni, Co and Li can reach 97.7%, 99.1% and 82.2% respectively.104 It can be found that atmosphere-assisted roasting can greatly reduce the temperature required for roasting and the product can have a higher recovery rate.107 Compared with the direct roasting process, it can recover Li, which would greatly improve the utilization efficiency of Li resources. However, the essence of atmosphere-assisted sintering is still the reduction and melting of metal oxides at high temperature, which requires great energy consumption. In addition, the thermite reaction mechanism in this process is still unclear and needs further study.92,108

3.3 Salt-assisted roasting
Salt-assisted roasting is a pyrometallurgical process that can better extract different metal elements from spent LIBs.109 In the direct roasting process, the recovery of Li is a big problem, a large number of Li elements are left in the slag, and the solubility of Li2CO3 produced in the atmosphere assisted roasting process is also not satisfactory, and it will take a lot of energy to recover it by thermal evaporation treatment. Salt-assisted roasting is a method by adding various inorganic salts or acids into LIBs before the heating process. The metal components in LIBs are retained in the form of metal salts after the roasting. And the metals can be recovered selectively by utilizing the different solubility of metal salts in certain solvents, which is an effective means of separating high-value metals (Fig. 7b).105,110 According to the different auxiliaries used, roasting can be divided into chlorination roasting, sulfation roasting and nitration roasting. Chlorination roasting uses HCl, NH4Cl, NaCl or Cl2 to react with LIBs to produce water-soluble chlorides.111 Water-soluble Li2SO4 can be produced by using SO2, MgSO4 and Na2SO4 in sulfation roasting.110,112 Nitration roasting uses nitrifiers such as HNO3 to react with LIBs to produce LiNO3, which is easily soluble in water (Fig. 7c).106 This process can greatly reduce the reaction temperature and realize the recovery of Li resources at 250 °C.113
Salt-assisted roasting can greatly reduce the temperature required for the separation of active materials, which makes it more commercial to perform the recycling. In addition, it can have a selective separation of different metals, improving the recovery rate of spent LIBs. Pyrometallurgy is the main powerful means to recover Ni, Co and other high-value metals. With the development of pyrometallurgy, Li Mn and other elements can also be better recovered, especially by a salt-assisted roasting process, which has great potential in the future of LIB recovery.
4. Hydrometallurgical technology
Hydrometallurgy is a LIB recovery method with lower energy consumption than pyrometallurgy. Compared with pyrometallurgy, it is easier to meet the high efficiency index, but it has higher requirements for environmental protection and safety standards. This method usually uses acids or alkalis such as hydrochloric acid (HCL), sulfuric acid (H2SO4), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), etc. to separate and extract high-value metals in spent LIBs.98,114 In order to explore the optimal leaching rate, a lot of studies have been carried out to find the most efficient set conditions, for example, the concentration of leaching solution, soaking time, temperature, etc.115,116 H2O2 was found to be a very effective reducing agent during the experimental process.14,117 Hydrometallurgy can be roughly divided into two main steps: leaching of high-value metals from LIBs and the recovery of high-value metal components (Fig. 8a). The main types of leaching processes are inorganic acid leaching, organic acid leaching and alkaline leaching; in addition, the enhanced leaching involved a reducing agent during the leaching process also plays an important role in leaching the high-value metals.118 The main methods for separating and recovering high-value metals from leachate are solvent extraction and chemical precipitation. In some circumstances, certain methods of providing energy assistance to the system are also used to facilitate metal extraction, such as ultrasonic-assisted extraction.44

4.1 Leaching process
As an essential process of hydrometallurgy, leaching is aimed at turning the high-value metals in active materials, which were obtained during the pretreatment process, into ions in solution. Leaching can be regard as the preparation of the subsequent purification and separation section. So the efficiency of the leaching process has a great contribution to the recycling of high-value metals in spent LIBs.

4.1.1 Inorganic acid leaching. 
Inorganic acid leaching as a traditional leaching method of metal ions has been widely studied so far. HCl,44,119 H2SO4,120,121 HNO3,122,123etc. have been widely applied in the leaching process of spent LIBs. These strong acids can efficiently leach cathodic active materials in small amounts. However, too strong acids will lead to the problems such as corrosion of leaching equipment and the contamination of waste solution.124 In addition, gases such as Cl2 produced by hydrochloric acid, SO2 produced by sulfuric acid, etc., can do great damage to the environment. To avoid or reduce the pollution of toxic gases, it is necessary to prepare the corresponding clean equipment, which will increase the cost of such leaching processes. To solve these problem, researchers explored a brand new way of inorganic acid leaching using phosphoric acid to leach high-value metals (Fig. 8b).125,126 In this way, Co in spent LIBs can be selectively recovered in the form of Co3(PO4)2 and Li ions are left in phosphoric solution. The leaching process using phosphoric acid is relatively environmentally friendly, which will not cause secondary pollution.127


4.1.2 Organic acid leaching. 
Compared with inorganic acid leaching, organic acid leaching has good biodegradability, which can avoid environmental pollution caused by toxic gases (Cl2, SOX, and NOX) generated in the process of battery recycling. This method has been widely used in the recovery of spent LIBs because of its feature of environmental friendliness.128 In addition, its leaching efficiency is equal to that of inorganic acid leaching.129,130 The chelating or complexing properties of organic acids allow them to be recycled, which makes it a solvent saving and economical method. Many organic acids such as malic acid,133 acetic acid,134 oxalic acid,79,135 citric acid,134,136 and ascorbic acid137 have been thoroughly studied in recent years.
Compared with strong acids such as H2SO4, malic acid treatment does not require acid–base neutralization of waste solution. In addition to environmental protection, it also has a high leaching efficiency, and for Li, Ni, Co, Mn and other metals, it can reach a leaching rate of more than 99%.138,139 Due to its low ionization constant, acetic acid is difficult to leach cobalt and other transition metal elements when used as leaching solution.134,140 Although the leaching efficiency of acetic acid itself is very low, higher leaching efficiency can be achieved by using it with other reagents or adding some auxiliary means. For example, under the combined action of H2O2 and acetic acid, the leaching rate of Li can reach more than 95%.141 Oxalic acid is much more acidic than acetic acid (10000 times), which can easily achieve the leaching of excessive metals such as Co (Fig. 8c).131,142 Thus, it plays a very important role in the recovery of high-value metals in spent LIBs. However, the concentration of oxalic acid must be considered when using oxalic acid for leaching. Excessive oxalic acid will lead to the re-dissolution of precipitation, resulting in the decrease of leaching efficiency.135 Citric acid also has strong acidity and is often used in industry as a complexing agent. The high H+ yield ratio (1:3) after dissolution endows it with excellent performance in the leaching of cathode materials.128,136,143


4.1.3 Alkaline leaching. 
Alkaline leaching is a method of leaching transition metals in alkaline solution through the reaction with NH3+. Compared with acid leaching, alkaline leaching does not require the use of H2O2, which is difficult to recover, as a reducing agent, and there is no secondary pollution caused by the HCL leaching process.144 A new environmentally friendly leaching system is likely to be built based on this leaching method. Nowadays, NH3·H2O, (NH4)2CO3, (NH4)Cl, etc., have been applied by researchers to investigate the leaching performance of high-value metals such as Ni, Co and Mn (Fig. 8d).132,145,146 In addition to experimental studies, the precipitation mechanism between ammonia solution and metal ions has also been explored too.147–149


4.1.4 Intensified leaching. 
Enhanced leaching is a method to increase metal extraction efficiency by using auxiliary means, including the mechanochemical method and ultrasonic-assisted method. The mechanochemical method is a process in which the cathode material is deformed by applying stress to it, thus inducing physical and chemical reactions. This leaching method has a similar function to the mechanochemical method used in the pretreatment process, enabling effective leaching of materials at room temperature and greatly reducing the use of solution. For example, Li and Co can be well separated by grinding LiCoO2 with EDTA,86 realizing 99% Co recovery in a small amount of solvent, which is a promising environmentally friendly way of spent LIB recycling. Ultrasonic-assisted leaching is carried out under the assistance of high power ultrasound. With the increase of ultrasonic power, the leaching efficiency can be significantly improved.150 Ultrasonic-assisted leaching can promote the interface contact between the solid and liquid so as to promote the dissolution of cathode materials. For example, with the help of 90 W ultrasonic power, the leaching efficiency of Co+ in the citric acid leaching process can be increased to more than 96% (Fig. 8e).44
The above-described inorganic acid leaching, organic acid leaching, alkaline leaching and enhanced leaching all have their own advantages. Among them, organic acid leaching is a new hydrometallurgical leaching method with great prospects because of its environmental friendliness, recyclability and higher efficiency than inorganic acid leaching. In addition, the enhanced leaching method can be combined with other leaching methods to achieve higher leaching efficiency.

4.2 Separation of high-value metals
Leaching solution usually contains many metal elements, such as Ni, Co, Li, Mn etc. Next, these different components need to be separated, usually using solvent extraction,115,144,146 chemical precipitation146,151–153 and electrochemical deposition,154,155 to extract different metals in the leaching solution. A combination of different separation methods is commonly used because a single separation method cannot completely separate all kinds of metals in the solution clearly.

4.2.1 Solvent extraction. 
Solvent extraction is a process of metal ion separation based on the different solubility of metal ions in a mixture of immiscible aqueous and organic solutions. In the recovery of spent LIBs, the solvent extraction process is usually followed by the leaching process to remove impurities in the solution and separate the required metals (Fig. 9a).154,156,157 Solvents commonly used in solvent extraction are di-(2-ethylhexyl)phosphoric acid (D2EHPA),158,159 bis-(2,4,4 trimethylpentyl)phosphinic acid (Cyanex 272),160–162 DEHPA (diethylhexylphosphoric acid),162–164 and PC-88A (2-ethylhexylphosphonic acid mono-2-ethylhexyl ester).165,166 Among them, Cyanex 272 has attracted much attention due to its Co selectivity. PC-88A is mainly used to extract Co, while D2EHPA is used to extract Mn. It can be found that Li cannot be effectively extracted in any of these solvents and must be further treated by other methods (Fig. 9b).166 In addition, the time, pH value, solvent concentration, temperature and other parameters will affect the extraction efficiency. Usually, the extraction process is completed within 30 min at room temperature, which not only ensures the extraction efficiency, but also reduces the time and economic cost.9

Due to the similarity of properties between transition metal ions, it is difficult to completely separate them in a single extraction process, thus requiring the continuous use of multiple extraction processes.169–171 The synergistic effect of different extraction agents can help to achieve a higher extraction effect (Fig. 9c).167,172,173 For example, after mixing Ionquest 801 (2-ethylhexyl phosphoric acid mono-2-ethylhexyl ester) and Acorga M5640 (5-nonylsalicylaldoxime), it can significantly enhance the extraction process of Cu.157
Solvent extraction, which has become a common method used in industry, enables a good separation of impurities and high-value metals. However, the complex process and high cost are its defects that cannot be ignored. Although there are still many studies to be explored, many existing studies on the extraction of high-value metals from spent Li-ion batteries can serve as theoretical guides for reference. In the future, solvent extraction should be developed in the direction of environmental friendliness and solvent recyclability.


4.2.2 Chemical precipitation. 
Chemical precipitation and solvent extraction are both used to remove impurities from the leaching solution and to separate valuable metals from it.174,175 Different from solvent extraction, chemical precipitation uses the different solubility of different metal compounds in certain solvent to conduct the separation. In addition, impurity metal ions tend to precipitate at low pH,176–178 so the solution can be kept at a low pH to remove impurities before the subsequent separation. The transition metal ions are precipitated first, and Li ions are usually treated at the end of the process due to their high solubility. H2C2O4, ammonium oxalate [(NH4)2C2O4], sodium hydroxide (NaOH), sodium phosphate (Na3PO4), and sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) are commonly used for precipitation. These substances can react with transition metal ions and Li ions to form a series of deposits such as transition metal hydroxides, oxalates, carbonates, and Li carbonate (Fig. 9d).151,168,179–182 During the process of treatment, in addition to the effect of the pH value on the precipitation of metal elements, temperature, solution concentration and other conditions will also have a great impact on the precipitation effect.
The extraction of high value metals by means of chemical precipitation usually requires tremendous trials to explore the optimal conditions. But with the development of computers, it is now possible to predict the tendency of ion precipitation in the reaction process by theoretical simulation.129,183–185 With the help of theoretical calculation, the experimental scheme can be optimized more reasonably and better experimental parameters can be obtained more efficiently. In the early stage, chemical precipitation is mainly used to precipitate Co2+ and Li+ in active materials. However, with the complexity of cathode materials, leaching solution usually contains a variety of metal ions, and the chemical properties of transition metal elements are very similar, so they are difficult to separate by conventional chemical precipitation methods. Therefore, it is more common to treat Ni, Co and Mn co-precipitation products as raw materials for the electrode.129,183,184 This approach reduces the cost of separating different transition metals while producing high value electrode materials.
Chemical precipitation has the advantages of simple operation and low cost, so it is widely used in the process of separating high-value metals. However, when precipitating multiple metal ions at the same time, it is necessary to control the precipitation conditions more carefully to obtain more pure products.
Hydrometallurgy, as a solvent based method of extracting high-value metals from active materials, has the advantages of low energy consumption and high efficiency compared with pyrometallurgy. However, a large number of solvents are used during the hydrometallurgy process, which will cause serious environment problems if not well treated. Thus, many environmentally friendly leaching solutions such as organic acid leaching and biological leaching are invented. These solvents can be recycled or degraded at room temperature, while ensuring the leaching efficiency. Although these methods can solve some of the problems of existing hydrometallurgy, there are more or less unsatisfactory aspects of these methods, such as the inability to obtain pure products in a single separation process, and the inability to separate transition metals with similar properties. Therefore, hydrometallurgy needs to be further explored in order to obtain a more efficient and economical method for extracting high-value metals.
Furthermore, we summarize in Table 1 recently developed representative conventional recycling-based battery technologies (pyrometallurgy and hydrometallurgy). It aims to provide new insights into the next generation of more energy efficient and environmentally friendly spent LIBs.

5. Emerging green technologies
In addition to pyrometallurgy and hydrometallurgy commonly used in industry, with the continuous upgrading of technology, emerging green technologies are also emerging (Fig. 10). Recently, bioleaching and electrochemical methods have emerged as next-generation candidates for recycling spent LIBs due to their environmental friendliness and unique advantages. Furthermore, compared with traditional pyrometallurgical techniques, the ionothermal synthesis strategy has attracted the attention of researchers as an emerging technology. Because it can obtain relevant high-temperature phase products at lower temperature and environmental pressure, it can achieve the purpose of energy saving, emission reduction and green environmental protection. We conduct a detailed analysis and discussion on the emerging technologies for recycling used batteries. We conclude this section with a list and discussion of recently developed and representative emerging green recycling technologies (Table 2). It aims to provide new insights into the next generation of more energy-efficient and environmentally friendly spent LIBs.

5.1 Bioleaching technology
Bioleaching is an emerging green technology in hydrometallurgy, which uses microorganisms to recover precious metals from the solution of spent batteries,195,196 which has a unique and environmentally friendly advantage in the way waste is handled. The key advantage of bioleaching is that it produces mildly acidic waste, less pollution and fewer processing hazards, and improves economic benefits compared to traditional technologies for recycling spent LIBs.197 There are many kinds of common bioleaching microorganisms, including: chemolithotrophic bacteria, heterotrophic bacteria and facultative heterotrophic bacteria.201–204 These microorganisms are strictly controlled by temperature, humidity and environmental toxicity, thus limiting their practical application. In practical industrial applications, a variety of microbial combinations are often used to coordinate and promote recovery.205
Mishra et al. employed chemotrophic and acidophilic bacteria for the leaching of spent LIBs containing LiCoO2, which utilized elemental sulfur and ferrous ions as energy sources to produce metabolites such as sulfuric acid and iron ions in the leaching medium. These metabolites help dissolve metals in spent batteries.206 Cao et al. performed bioleaching-mediated metal recovery at a high solid content from spent nickel, manganese, cobalt (NMC)-based LIBs using autotrophic bacteria. Inductively Coupled Plasma- Optical Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-OES) analysis showed that 90% nickel (Ni), 92% manganese (Mg), 82% cobalt (Co) and 89% Li were recovered from spent LIBs in 72 hours at a solid content of 100 g L−1 (Fig. 11a and b).199 Recently, Cao et al. based on Thiobacillus ferrooxidans-mediated bioleaching, obtained leaching of 85.5% Ni, 91.8% Mg, 90.4% Co and 89.9% Li from NMC-based spent LIBs within 6 hours. Furthermore, the electrochemical stability of NMC 111 and NMC 622 by regeneration is comparable to that of commercial NMC (about 85% capacity retention after 50 cycles at 100 mA g−1). This regeneration method seems promising in LIB recovery for long-term industrial development (Fig. 11c).198

In addition to microbial bacterial leaching, fungi used in a leaching process also showed good results. Fungal leaching can accommodate growth in a wide pH range and tolerate toxic substances and high leaching rates. Aspergillus niger is a common bioleaching fungus. Based on an experimental comparison study, it was shown that the Li extraction rate of bacteria was the highest regardless of time, while the bioleaching efficiency of fungi was the highest in a short period of time.207 Alavi et al. demonstrated that a mixed fungal culture of Aspergillus niger and Aspergillus tuberosus successfully recovered metals from LIBs with high recovery efficiency.208 Mousavi et al. used organic acids produced by Aspergillus niger for leaching waste LIBs of different pulp densities. The process yielded high metal recoveries: 100% Cu, 100% Li, 77% Mn, and 75% Al (at 2% (w v−1) pulp density), indicating its suitability for large-scale industrial use (Fig. 11d).200
5.2 Electrochemical technology
The technology of recycling waste LIBs based on an electrochemical method provides higher production capacity, and it does not require the use of chemically regenerated materials, reduces water consumption and chemical waste production, and allows production rate control, improving market economics.212,213 Inspired by “desalination batteries” and “mixed entropy batteries”,214,215 Pasta et al. proposed the electrochemical extraction of Li metal by the method presented in Fig. 12a and b (the term electrochemical ion pumping). It is clear that electrochemical ion pumping requires less energy, which is related to entropy (related to the breaking and formation of chemical bonds). By repeating the cycle of Fig. 12a and b, the Li concentration and purity of the recovered solution can be increased. Other similar methods are described in Fig. 12c. The electrodes used and the steps required are the same as above, but in this case the charge neutrality of the system is balanced by the transfer of anions through AEM. In general, electrochemical methods can be divided into electro-assisted adsorption methods and electrochemical ion pumping processes.216,217 The common main method is Li recovery based on capacitance-improved Faraday electrodes, which has higher selectivity, higher recovery and greater versatility.

Sun et al. designed a paired electrolysis method to realize the recovery of valuable metals from spent LIBs. This method obtained high-purity cobalt metal (>99.9%) and simultaneously synthesized valuable persulfate through a diaphragm electrolyzer, reducing energy consumption by about 30%.218 Notably, the recovery of valuable metals from spent LIBs is enhanced by reductive heat treatment and electrochemical leaching. The composite method can be implemented at room temperature, reducing the use of reducing agents and sulfuric acid, and the final leaching yield is 90.59% Ni, 90.53% Co, 66.40% Mn and 100% Li (at a 20 mL g−1 liquid–solid ratio, 1.5 MH2SO4 leaching under optimal conditions) (Fig. 12d and e).211 Mechanisms based on the interaction of surface chemical reactions and diffusion also demonstrate excellent leaching efficiency. Meng et al. used an electrochemical cathodic reduction method (leaching at 70 °C for 180 min using 1.25 mol L−1 malic acid and 8 V operating voltage) to obtain a leaching efficiency of about 90% for Co and close to 94% for Li.138 Furthermore, LiCoO2 was regenerated from the recovered CoO and Li2CO3 based on an efficient and environmentally friendly molten salt electrolysis (MSE) method, which exhibited excellent electrochemical performance as a cathode for LIBs.219
More surprisingly, electrochemical relithiation technology can directly regenerate Li cathode materials for use.220–222 For example, Zhang et al. used an electrochemical relithiation method to directly regenerate LiCoO2 cathode materials based on discarded LixCoO2 electrodes, showing good electrochemical performance (the charging capacity is 136 mA h g−1, which is close to that of commercial LiCoO2 electrodes (140 mA h g−1)) (Fig. 12f).223 Using the above method to recover waste LiMn2O4 and directly using it as the cathode of SIBs, its discharge capacity can gradually increase to 163.2 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles at 100 mA g−1.224
5.3 Molten salt
Nearly every recovery process of spent LIBs requires the conversion of high value metal components into different forms of compound components by breaking the chemical bonds of cathode materials.219 The molten salt, which is rich in Li ions, has high ionic conductivity and a wide electrochemical window, making it easier to change the valence states of high value meals such as Co3+ and Li+.25 The molten salt method is an efficient and environmentally friendly method to recover high-value metals from spent LIBs. Usually, it makes use of an applied electric field to generate the oxides of high value metals through the electrochemical redox reaction of cathode materials and then the solid products are separated depending on the solubility of different solid oxides in molten salt.105,109,111 The molten salt method has the advantage of one-step treatment compared with hydrometallurgy and normal pyrometallurgy, which require multi-step treatment. During the recovery process, the impurity groups in spent LIBs will decompose due to high temperature, leaving the required cathode components to be recycled.225 On the other hand, molten salt acts as both the electrolyte and the Li source. The high concentration of Li+ in molten salt can accelerate the ion diffusion rate on the one hand and solve the problem of Li+ loss in the electrolyte on the other hand.
Zhang et al. used the molten salt method to recycle decommissioned LiFePO4 batteries (Fig. 13a and b).226 Through paired electrolysis, LiFePO4 is converted into Fe at the cathode and into Fe3O4 at the anode, and Li+ and PO43− are released into the molten salt at the same time, and the final Li recovery rate reaches more than 95.2%.226 It is proved that the recovery of LiFePO4 by the molten salt method is a very advanced and environmentally friendly way. Yang et al. used the molten salt method to regenerate waste LiCoO2 materials (Fig. 13c).227 With the help of a high Li ion concentration and high ion diffusion rate of molten salt, the regenerated LiCoO2 obtained after reaction at 500 °C possesses a similar structure and performance to the commercial one. The reclaimed LiCoO2 has a higher discharge capacity of 76.2 mA h g−1 than that before treatment and can still maintain more than 90% capacity after 200 cycles (Fig. 13d).227 It shows that the molten salt method can also be used for the direct regeneration and recovery of spent electrode materials and has good regeneration ability. Deng et al. used a molten salt medium to directly recover the degraded ternary cathode material LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 (NCM523) (Fig. 13e).228 The method is simple and convenient, and its performance is comparable to that of commercial materials (Fig. 13f). Furthermore, the inherent network structure between NCM523 and carbon in the spent cathode can trigger a faster relithiation process.228

The molten salt method, as an important way of heat recovery, has attracted many scholars' interest recently. It can make use of electric energy without the use of various chemical reagents for leaching and purification during the recovery process, which makes it more environmentally friendly. In addition, the rich Li content of molten salt also gives it inherent advantages for Li recovery. However, the molten salt method also has non-negligible disadvantages, such as incomplete decomposition of impurities, which affects the performance of the product, a low energy utilization rate, and only half of the reaction is used to drive the process of battery recovery.229,230
5.4 Other cutting-edge technologies
In addition to the above well-known emerging green waste LIB recycling technologies, there are some other unique recycling strategies worth analysing and researching. The recycling of spent LIBs by the ionic liquids (ILs) method has many advantages, such as negligible vapor pressure and flammability, wide liquidus range, good thermal stability, and synthetic flexibility, for the direct recovery of LIBs cathodes.231–234 Based on this strategy, Wang et al. employed cost-effective Li halide as the Li source and a recyclable ionic liquid as the solvent to realize the direct recovery of spent LIB cathode materials. It exhibits excellent electrochemical performance and the charging capacity is 173.6 mA h g−1 for the first charging (Fig. 14a–c).235

Based on the failure mechanism analysis of LIB cathode materials, it is found that LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 (NCM523) cathode materials have problems such as the dissolution of Li and transition metals, surface interface failure and structural transformation.222,236–238 Combined with the above analysis, NCM523 material can be directly regenerated by supplementing metal ions, granulation, ion doping and heat treatment (Fig. 14d).239,240 It is worth noting that the recycling process is economical, efficient and environmentally friendly. For example, Fan et al. designed a green, high-efficiency, closed-loop direct regeneration technique to reconstitute the NCM523 material, which exhibits excellent electrochemical performance with a discharge capacity of 189.8 mA h g−1 (Fig. 14e).222 In addition to the NCM523 cathode material, waste Li2CO3 material can be converted into LiCoO2 through the above strategy improvement, and its electrochemical performance is better than that of commercial LiCoO2.241
In addition, the direct regeneration of spent LIB cathodes through chemical relithiation reactions enables closed-loop recycling and minimizes chemical waste emissions. Qian et al. presented a thermodynamically spontaneous Li+-electron coordinated radical redox process in which polycyclic aryllithium compounds acted as reducing agents and Li+ donors to repair Li loss in degraded cathodes. The method can obtain recycled material in a short time.242
6. Conclusion and prospects
Recently, the recycling of waste rechargeable batteries has been widely used and researched in many countries and has made great progress. Throughout the world, with the widespread use of electric vehicles and other electronic devices, the demand for Li resources has increased rapidly. The efficient development of Li resources has become a current research hotspot. Recycling used rechargeable batteries is highly desirable and beneficial from economic and environmental points of view.
In this review, we present current advanced pretreatment, pyrometallurgical and hydrometallurgical techniques guided by the most widely used conventional LIB recycling processes. In order to make a more reasonable evaluation, it should be made clear that a good green recycling method needs to take into account the efficiency, recovery rate and safety. We creatively put forward a standard to evaluate the green degree of the recycling means. The impact parameters including the process time, operation steps and process energy consumption were taken as the efficiency index 3E to assess the recycling process; the recovery rate of high-value metals, types of recycled high-value metals and solvent recyclability are introduced as the recovery index 3R to assess the recovery process; the operation risk, solvent toxicity and material degradability were taken into account as 3S indices to assess the safety of the recycling process. Therefore, we need to consider it comprehensively from these three perspectives. Only by making progress in all three aspects compared with the traditional recycling method, can this method be considered as a greener recycling method. The 3E criteria ensure the high efficiency of a recycling method, the 3R criteria ensure that waste battery recycling has a high recovery capacity and the 3S criteria ensure that the recycling method is relatively safe for both the environment and the operator. The three groups of parameters, 3E, 3R and 3S, jointly constructed a comprehensive evaluation system for the green degree of the spent LIB recycling process. In addition, this standard evaluates the efficiency, safety and economy of the recycling process, and divides the green degree of different recycling means into three grades. Recently developed representative recycling technologies are discussed in detail (Tables 1 and 2). To sum up, on the basis of comparative analysis of the existing problems in the existing technologies, the prospects and directions for the recycling of waste Li are put forward.
6.1 Pretreatment
The pretreatment of used batteries has serious safety problems (such as explosion, natural heat generation, etc.) for some large-capacity batteries. However, the traditional manual or mechanical disassembly process has violent disassembly, which does not conform to the safety process and cannot effectively solve the above-mentioned safety problems. Looking at the general trend of the waste battery recycling industry from afar, there is an urgent need for efficient and safe recycling and pretreatment technology in the future. Pretreatment is an important part of the waste battery recycling process. In the future, a variety of pretreatment technologies can be combined to optimize the recycling process to meet the safety and technical requirements of industrial recycling. In addition, the efficiency and accuracy of the sorting process for different types of batteries need to be further improved. It can be combined with advanced artificial intelligence technology and remote control of the battery decomposition process, which will effectively improve safety and operational standardization. Due to the airtightness of the battery structure, the pretreatment decomposition process has brought about great difficulties, resulting in the inability of the different components of the battery to be effectively separated. In the future, the battery construction can be optimized, and the integrated design from the production of the battery to the decomposition can provide new avenues.
6.2 Pyrometallurgy
Pyrometallurgy has problems such as high pollution, high noise and low efficiency, and it is in urgent need of technical improvement. Facing the development trend of high efficiency and environmental friendliness, a variety of characterization techniques and detection technologies can be combined to comprehensively improve the pyrometallurgical method of waste battery recycling. By detecting and analyzing the waste gas generated during the calcination process, other gases (CO2, N2, etc.) can be added to assist in purifying the waste gas and regulating the waste gas. In addition, the stratified combustion technology can be used for reference, and distributed combustion can be carried out in layers, aiming at refining precious metal alloys with high output and low energy consumption. At the same time, in order to maximize economic benefits and reduce pollution, a comprehensive treatment method combining hydrometallurgy and pyrometallurgy can be used.
6.3 Hydrometallurgy
Compared with pyrometallurgy, hydrometallurgy has the characteristics of low cost, low energy consumption and environmental friendliness. As a commercialized recycling process, hydrometallurgy (solvent extraction method) also has problems such as toxic waste discharge and low yield. In the future, discharged waste should be purified and recycled, and extraction process analysis should be rationalized to produce high-efficiency products. In addition, multiple recycling technologies are integrated to establish an overall process and mass balance for process commercialization and economic benefits.
6.4 Emerging green technologies
Bioleaching has become a research hotspot in recent years, with the characteristics of low pollution and low energy consumption. However, further application is limited due to its slow kinetics, poor microbial resistance to metal toxicity, and susceptibility to acidic environments. In view of the above problems, microorganisms can be improved by using microorganisms in combination. Organisms can also be genetically modified to obtain microbial capabilities such as resistance to metal toxicity, resistance to acidic environments, and increasing metabolite production. In addition, the temperature and moderate conditions are strictly controlled to recover valuable metals in an environmentally friendly and energy-saving manner. Electrochemical methods offer higher production capacity for Li metal recovery, reduced water consumption and production of chemical waste, while having a controllable production rate. To further improve the feasibility of large-scale use of this method, on the basis of computational simulation and machine learning, various setting parameters (current, flow, mass load) can be adjusted to adapt to various recycling environments. In addition, improvements in electrochemical cell design and electrode materials, as well as recycling processes, maximize recycling efficiency. As an important heat recovery method, the molten salt method uses electric energy for leaching and purification without adding various chemical reagents during the recovery process, which is more environmentally friendly. In the future, it is necessary to conduct in-depth research on the shortcomings of incomplete decomposition of impurities, which can be compensated for by combining physical methods to improve product quality.
