    , Accepted 16th March 2018First published on 16th March 2018AbstractThe power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of solution-processed organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices continue increasing towards the 15% milestone. Recently-emerging non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) have significantly accelerated this development. Most of the efficiency analyses performed previously are based on a fullerene acceptor without considering its contribution to the enhancement of photo-absorption and PCE. Moreover, the stability and cost potential of OPV devices are usually not discussed, which sometimes makes the efficiency prediction less representative for broad interest. In this work, we effectively combine the prediction of efficiencies with experimentally determined stability data to analyze and predict the commercial potential of a NFA-based OPV product. Assuming that NFAs dominate the blend near IR absorption, the efficiency limit of OPV devices is predicted to be close to 20% and is found to be insensitive to the donor bandgap. With the excellent photo-stability observed for state-of-the-art NFA-based OPV devices, it is suggested that the corresponding customized donors with promising processing properties, excellent environmental stability and low synthesis complexity be designed as realistic material pairs for large-scale production and commercialization.

Broader context
The success of a photovoltaic technology is determined by an optimal combination of its efficiency, lifetime and production cost. It is generally accepted that a module efficiency of >10% in combination with an operational lifetime of >10 years and a production cost of ≪1 € per Wpeak is suggested for industrial production of organic solar cells (OSCs). Great progress has been made over the last few years in developing highly efficient and stable OSCs with device performances exceeding 12%. Recently-emerging non-fullerene acceptors have significantly accelerated this progress and boosted the performance of OSCs towards the 15% milestone. However, apart from the performance and stability, the production cost, especially the material cost, plays an essential role in determining the success and industrial viability of OSCs. In this analysis, we analyze step-by-step the efficiency, stability and cost potential for OSCs in one figure of merit, which allows us to directly compare the industrial viability of OSCs based on various material systems. Moreover, the analysis clearly suggests that organic semiconductors with low synthetic complexity, such as P3HT, would be the preferred choice for large-scale production and commercialization, if a promising and compatible acceptor is available.

1. Introduction
After two decades of rapid development, organic photovoltaic (OPV) technologies have reached a respectable scientific level of understanding with excellent power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of over 13% for solution-processed lab-scale devices, approaching a tipping point for large-scale production and commercialization.1–8 The advantages of OPV devices, such as light weight, semi-transparency, low cost and easy manufacturing on a large-scale, make OPVs a very attractive technology for non-grid connected applications.9 To further stimulate the market growth of the OPV technology, its potential has to be analyzed in terms of efficiency, stability and cost, in particular for recently emerging non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs).
Solution-processed fullerene derivatives, such as phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM), have been predominately used as acceptors in bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs) since the mid-1990s, boosting the efficiency of OSCs to the 10–12% regime.10–18 However, fullerene-based acceptors have some inherent disadvantages, such as low absorption in the abundant regions of the solar spectrum and a low miscibility with most conjugated polymers resulting in strong agglomeration upon thermal stress, which have been delaying market development for OPVs. NFAs have emerged during the last 5 years as a promising alternative to fullerenes.19,20 Great effort has been devoted towards developing NFAs with tunable optoelectronic properties and promising stability.19–32 The champion efficiency of over 13% was achieved by combined molecular optimization of both a polymer donor and a non-fullerene acceptor.2 Moreover, excellent thermal stability and device stability under illumination were reported for OSCs based on NFAs, indicating their significant potential for commercialization.33,34 The recent progress in developing non-fullerene acceptors for OSCs has been summarized in several review papers.19–23
Although a huge number of OPV donors and acceptors have been developed in the last decade, boosting the efficiency up to 13%, the processing properties of state-of-the-art OPV materials under ambient conditions using a roll-to-roll compatible printing method still remain a challenge. This is mainly due to the insufficient environmental stability of OPV materials and the delicate BHJ micromorphology that is required to optimize charge carrier generation and transport.35,36 It is accepted that the success of a PV technology is determined by an optimal combination of its efficiency, lifetime and production cost. To push the PV technology towards commercialization, a module efficiency of >10% in combination with an operational lifetime of >10 years and a production cost of ≪1 € per Wpeak is required.9 The OPV technology has unique properties compared to other commercial PV technologies, such as its flexibility, semi-transparency and colorful device configurations, and as a result, OPV devices may find application in niche products with moderate requirements in terms of module efficiency, operational lifetimes and production costs for mobile or de-centralized applications in daily life. Therefore, the OPV design rules for a successful mass product are distinctly different from roof-top or green-field grid-connected PV technologies for renewable power stations.9
In our previous work, an industrial figure of merit (i-FoM) was introduced for solution-processed OSCs based on molecular donors and PCBM as an acceptor.37 Three essential factors, namely the efficiency, stability and cost of materials, were taken into account to assess the industrial product interest. The definition of the i-FoM is given by:  More than 30 molecular donors were analyzed in combination with PCBM, and the i-FoM value was found to vary between 0.05 and 0.15.37 Based on experimental results and simulation data, an i-FoM value of 0.2 along with a PCE of >14% was found at that stage as a benchmark for industrial production. However, a PCE of >14% is already at the efficiency limits of single-junction OPV devices based on PCBM as an acceptor according to Scharber et al.38–40 It was challenging to simultaneously develop material combinations satisfying high efficiency, long-term stability and a cost-efficient synthesis, and nearly all synthetic efforts have concentrated on achieving high efficiencies instead. Nevertheless, quickly emerging NFAs offer the potential to address these three challenges in parallel, as the recent progress has shown high efficiencies and lifetimes in parallel. Molecular acceptors are developed on the one hand to broaden the absorption of OSCs, and on the other hand to increase the open-circuit voltage (VOC) by minimizing the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level difference between the donor and acceptor. A remarkable short-circuit current density (JSC) of >25 mA cm−2, an unprecedentedly low non-radiative VOC loss of 0.20 V and an excellent fill factor (FF) of >75% have been demonstrated in individual NFA-based OPV devices, exhibiting their serious scientific potential to increase the efficiency of OSCs beyond the currently predicted single-junction limit of about 15%.41–43
In this work, we adopt the i-FoM approach to analyze the efficiency, stability and product relevance of NFA-based OSCs according to combined experimental results and simulation data. Three model polymers are used as donors, while PCBM and one recently developed NFA are used as acceptors for the i-FoM analysis. The comparison to PCBM is included to highlight the difference in general design rules for these two material generations. According to the recent findings on efficient charge dissociation at donor:acceptor interfaces with minimized energy difference, we reformulate conditions defined for theoretical efficiency prediction, and find that an excellent efficiency of ∼20% can be achieved for the three donor materials when an “ideal” acceptor is used. Moreover, a stable BHJ morphology and device stability can be expected for NFA-based OPV devices. Therefore, the i-FoM value is only determined by the synthetic complexity (SC) of the donor and acceptor materials. Interestingly, OPV materials with simple chemical structures and synthetic routes, such as poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT), will be ultimately the most promising candidates for large-scale production and commercialization.
2. Results and discussion
The chemical structures of three model polymers, P3HT, poly[4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b;4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl-alt-(4-(2-ethylhexyl)-3-fluorothieno[3,4-b]thiophene-)-2-carboxylate-2-6-diyl] (PCE10 or PTB7-Th) and poly[(5,6-difluoro-2,1,3-benzothiadiazol-4,7-diyl)-alt-(3,3′′′-di(2-octyldodecyl)-2,2′;5′,2′′;5′′,2′′′-quaterthiophen-5,5′′′-diyl)] (PCE11 or PffBT4T-2OD), are illustrated in Fig. 1. The three polymer donors were chosen owing to their excellent performance in combination with the chosen NFA and stability when printed under ambient conditions.35,44,45 The SC index of the three polymers and the two acceptors were estimated according to Po et al.,46 summarized in Table S1 (ESI†), while their efficiencies and stabilities were taken from the literature, which are summarized in Table S2 (ESI†).44,47,48 It is worth mentioning that the efficiency data were taken exclusively from literature reports where the corresponding stability data are available, which significantly limits the available data. Moreover, we are aware that it's difficult to unify standards for estimating the SC values of different materials, especially fullerene-based acceptors. However, even for the same materials the synthetic routes described by different research groups may result in slightly different SC values. Nevertheless, the slightly different SC values do not affect the discussion and conclusion of this analysis work. Different from the previous i-FoM analysis, the SC index of the acceptor was also taken into account in this study by defining the SC index of the BHJ mixture (SC index (M)), where the polymer and the acceptor index are averaged according to the weight ratios used (Table S3, ESI†).
 Fig. 1  Chemical structures of donors and acceptors investigated in this study. 
In the first step, the i-FoM values were calculated for the three polymers blended with PCBM by adopting the experimental results and the estimated SC index (M), as summarized in Table 1. The calculated i-FoM values range from 0.183 for P3HT:PCBM, and 0.229 for PCE10:PCBM to 0.258 for PCE11:PCBM. As defined by Po et al., the SC index scales differently for polymers and molecular donors.46 Therefore, the absolute values of the i-FoM calculation cannot be directly compared with our previous analysis on molecular donors. Nevertheless, the analysis made for this study followed identical boundary conditions, and therefore allows directly comparing the different donors and the different acceptors. Although P3HT exhibits the lowest of all efficiencies with only 2.8%, the extremely low SC index of 7.7% (14.1% for the P3HT:PCBM 1:1 mixture) and the good stability factor of 0.92 make it surprisingly attractive compared to other high-performance state-of-the-art donors for industrial production. The i-FoM values were estimated to be 0.229 for PCE10:PCBM and 0.258 for PCE11:PCBM, which were mainly limited by the high SC index of PCE10 (64.3%) and the strong burn-in degradation of PCE11:PCBM (200 h stability = 0.67).

By replacing PCBM with the NFA O-IDTBR, the i-FoM values of all combinations increased significantly due to either improved PCE or enhanced stability values. For instance, the PCE was improved from 2.8% for P3HT:PCBM to 6.05% for P3HT:O-IDTBR. No degradation was observed for PCE11:O-IDTBR solar cells, while PCE11:PCBM solar cells suffered from a noticeable burn-in degradation. However, due to the high SC index of O-IDTBR (43.9%), the SC indexes of BHJ mixtures with NFAs were estimated to be higher than those with PCBM mixtures. Overall, the i-FoM value was slightly improved from 0.183 for P3HT:PCBM to 0.230 for P3HT:O-IDTBR, while PCE10:O-IDTBR and PCE11:O-IDTBR exhibited almost unchanged i-FoM values of 0.219 and 0.255, respectively. Although a remarkably high PCE of 12% and an excellent device stability were attained for PCE10:O-IDTBR, the much more complex synthesis of PCE10 and O-IDTBR limits the SC index to 52.1%. Nevertheless, it is notable that all the polymer:O-IDTBR blends exhibit excellent device stability, which contributes to satisfying the lifetime requirement for commercial applications.
By employing NFAs in BHJ blends, both JSC and VOC of OPV devices can be simultaneously improved compared to the PCBM-based control devices. As already mentioned above, the improved JSC is related to the broadened optical absorption contribution from the NFAs, while the improved VOC originates from the optimized energy level difference.24,29 Moreover, recent publications reported that the charge transfer states of NFA-based PV devices were either not identified at all, or found to be much higher than those of the corresponding PCBM-based devices, which is also beneficial to an enhanced VOC.42,49 It seems that the difference in the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level between the donor and NFA is not critical for efficient charge dissociation. Several groups have reported that a minimized HOMO level difference less than 0.1 eV in solution-processed OPV devices could still deliver EQE values >0.6.43,50–52
In the next step, we will introduce an improved model to predict the efficiency limit for NFA-based OSCs. The model used by Scharber et al., as illustrated in Fig. 2a, is solely based on the PCBM acceptor, and the absorption of PCBM is not considered for efficiency prediction.38,39 The LUMO level of PCBM (ELUMO_PCBM) is fixed at −4.0 eV, and the VOC is defined by the energy difference between the ELUMO_PCBM and the HOMO of the donor (EHOMO_Donor) with an additional energy loss of 0.3 eV. The LUMO of the donor (ELUMO_Donor) is defined to be higher than the ELUMO_PCBM with the smallest energy difference of 0.3 eV empirically assumed for efficient charge dissociation, corresponding to a bandgap-to-VOC loss of 0.6 V. The JSC is determined by the bandgap of the donor (Eg_Donor) with an assumed constant external quantum efficiency (EQE). With a constant FF, the PCEs are therefore predicted as a function of the Eg_Donor and the LUMO difference between the donor and PCBM.
 Fig. 2  Energy levels of a donor and an acceptor used for predicting the efficiency of OPV devices based on PCBM (a) and NFAs (b). 

Fig. 2b describes the modified model used in this study, which takes the absorption of NFAs better into account. It is defined in the model that the ELUMO_Donor and EHOMO_Donor are always higher than the ELUMO_NFA and EHOMO_NFA, respectively, without defining the smallest energy difference. Owing to the gradual absorption onset, bandgap fluctuations, non-ideal charge carrier collection efficiency and additional non-radiative recombination, the VOC of OSCs is much lower than the value determined by the detailed balance limit (VOC,SQ).53,54 The VOC of OSCs is therefore given by: VOC = Eg/q − ΔVOC,SQ − ΔVOC,rad − ΔVOC,nr(1)where Eg is the smallest bandgap of either the donor or acceptor, q is the elementary charge, ΔVOC,SQ is the loss defined by the Shockley–Queisser theory, ΔVOC,rad is the additional loss related to radiative recombination and the ΔVOC,nr is the loss due to non-radiative recombination. The ΔVOC,SQ is typically between 0.25 and 0.3 V for a semiconductor with a bandgap between 1.2 and 2 eV. ΔVOC,rad can be as low as zero, while a remarkably low ΔVOC,nr of 0.2 V was observed for OSCs.43 To simplify the efficiency calculation, we define a bandgap-to-VOC loss (ΔVOC,Eg) of 0.45–0.5 V as a rational limit for OSCs. By taking into consideration the energetic mismatch between EHOMO_Donor and EHOMO_NFA (if Eg_Donor ≥ Eg_NFA) or between ELUMO_Donor and ELUMO_NFA (if Eg_Donor ≤ Eg_NFA), the VOC of OSCs is described as VOC = Eg/q − ΔVOC,m − ΔVOC,Eg = ΔE/q − ΔVOC,Eg(2)where ΔVOC,m is the energetic mismatch, ΔVOC,Eg is the bandgap-to-VOC loss (0.45–0.5 V for OSCs) and ΔE is the energetic difference between EHOMO_Donor and ELUMO_NFA. Since both the donor and acceptor contribute to the absorption of photons and the generation of photocurrent, we simplified the JSC calculation by only using the smallest bandgap estimated for the donor and acceptor, as illustrated in Fig. S1 (ESI†). Under the assumption of a constant EQE = 0.8, a FF = 0.75 and a ΔVOC,Eg = 0.5 V, the efficiencies of the three model polymers are calculated and plotted as a function of the Eg_NFA and the ELUMO_NFA in Fig. 3. The optoelectronic properties of the three polymers, including energy levels, electrical and optical bandgaps, etc., are taken from the literature and summarized in Table S4 (ESI†).3,29 The electrical bandgaps, estimated by the energy difference between the HOMO and LUMO, are in good agreement with the corresponding optical bandgaps determined by the absorption of thin films. Although the bandgaps of the three polymer donors range from 1.9 to 1.6 eV, the highest achievable PCEs of 17.6% are of course identical for all polymers as an ideal non-fullerene acceptor (i-NFA) with a bandgap of ∼1.4 eV dominates absorption and the JSC of OSCs. The highest PCEs are achieved for an i-NFA with a bandgap of ∼1.4 eV and a HOMO level being equal to that of the polymer donor, i.e. ΔVOC,m = 0. In this case, the LUMO level of the i-NFA has to be correspondingly adjusted for given organic donors to reach the highest possible efficiency.
 Fig. 3  Prediction of PCEs of single-junction OPV devices based on P3HT, PCE10 and PCE11 by taking into account the contribution of NFAs. The prediction was performed based on the improved model described in Fig. 2b under the assumptions of (a) a bandgap to VOC loss = 0.5 V, a constant EQE = 0.8 and a FF = 0.75; (b) a bandgap to VOC loss = 0.45 V, a constant EQE = 0.8 and a FF = 0.8. 
The efficiency was again calculated under the assumption of a constant EQE = 0.8, a FF = 0.8 and a ΔVOC,Eg = 0.45 V, in which case the highest achievable PCEs were enhanced to 19.8% for all three polymers. These assumed values are still reasonable by comparing with the values used in the literature for efficiency calculation, and the highest values reported for OSCs.2,3,39,40 As depicted in Fig. 3, the optimal bandgap of i-NFAs still remained at ∼1.4 eV. For both cases, the VOC loss is only related to the Eg_NFA with a ΔVOC,Eg of 0.5 or 0.45 V. According to the Shockley–Queisser limit, a VOC_SQ of 1.14 V is determined for a semiconductor with a bandgap of 1.4 eV, corresponding to a ΔVOC,SQ of 0.26 eV.53 The assumed ΔVOC,Eg of 0.5 or 0.45 V is reasonable for achieving the highest possible PCE of 17.6% or 19.8%, which is rationally higher than the efficiency predicted for PCBM-based OSCs.39 It is worth mentioning that a constant EQE of 0.8, a FF of 0.8 and a low bandgap-to-VOC loss of 0.45 V might not be feasible for every OPV system. Nevertheless, based on the very promising experimental values reported for state-of-the-art OSCs, we are quite optimistic that OPV technologies have the great potential to reach the suggested efficiency limit of 19.8%.
In this work we take a PCE of 19.8% for calculating the i-FoM values of OSCs based on i-NFAs. By taking a stability value of 1.00 (PCE11:O-IDTBR) and attributing the SC index of i-NFA to be the same as that of PCBM, the i-FoM values are re-calculated for polymer:i-NFA blends and summarized in Table 1. As the PCE and the stability are the same for all the combinations, the i-FoM is only determined by the SC index of the donor and acceptor. Not surprisingly, owing to its smallest SC index, P3HT emerges as the most attractive donor in combination with an i-NFA in terms of industrial interest and commerciality. The very impressive i-FoM of 1.404 for P3HT:i-NFA, which is six times higher than those of PCBM- and O-IDTBR-based OPV devices, will be a benchmark for evaluating the commercial potential of next-generation OPV materials in terms of efficiency, stability and cost. It is worthwhile to underline again that the i-NFA is proposed to explore the highest possible i-FoM for the three model polymers under the assumption of excellent device performance and stability. It is very interesting to know that the device performance is no longer determined by the polymer donors, but the optoelectronic properties of the i-NFA. Back to the discussion on the requirements for industrial viability, a module efficiency of >10% in combination with an operational lifetime of >10 years and a production cost ≪1 € per Wpeak is required. The most critical point here is the production cost. The P3HT:PCBM system, which gives a SC index of 14.1%, would be the cheapest material combination so far. By taking a SC index of 14.1% along with a device stability of 98% and a PCE of 10%, an i-FoM value of ∼0.7 is obtained, which can be considered as a benchmark value for industrial production of OSCs. By taking into consideration the suggested benchmark i-FoM value of 0.7, the equation describing the industrial viability of OSCs is therefore given by  
The selection of material combinations is more relaxed for OSCs with high PCE. By taking the stability of 100% and the highest possible PCE of 19.8% predicted for OSCs based on an i-NFA, the corresponding SC value is calculated to be ∼28%. For OSCs with efficiencies lower than 19.8%, a correspondingly low SC (limited materials) has to be taken into consideration for commercialization. We may therefore conclude that any material system that has a SC index larger than 28% (for instance PCE10-based OSCs) cannot reach an i-FoM value of 0.7, which is nearly impossible for industrial production.
3. Conclusion
In this work we analyzed an improved simulation model of efficiency prediction by taking into account the contribution of acceptors to predict the efficiency limit of OPV devices. The simple, semi-empirical model describes the efficiencies of PCBM-based OSCs, and is also valid to predict the efficiency limit for OPVs employing NFAs. We analyzed step-by-step the i-FoM values for three model polymers blended with three acceptors, PCBM, O-IDTBR and a conceived i-NFA that matches the requirement to get the highest possible PV performance. In contrast to previous models where the contribution from PCBM is ignored, by taking into consideration the absorption and the well aligned energy levels of NFAs, a theoretical efficiency limit of 19.8% is predicted for all the polymer donors investigated with bandgaps ranging from 1.6 to 1.9 eV when blended with a NFA with a bandgap of ∼1.4 eV. Most importantly, the improved model suggests that the absorption of OPV devices and the bandgap-to-VOC loss will be more relevant to the small bandgap acceptors rather than donors. In such cases, donors with promising processing properties, excellent environmental stability and low SC indexes, such as P3HT, will be the preferred choice for large-scale production and commercialization. We believe that the simulation model described in this work along with the interesting outcome of efficiency prediction and the i-FoM is helpful to the research community to better direct the synthetic efforts towards designing novel NFAs for next-generation OPV materials.

Broader context
The success of a photovoltaic technology is determined by an optimal combination of its efficiency, lifetime and production cost. It is generally accepted that a module efficiency of >10% in combination with an operational lifetime of >10 years and a production cost of ≪1 € per Wpeak is suggested for industrial production of organic solar cells (OSCs). Great progress has been made over the last few years in developing highly efficient and stable OSCs with device performances exceeding 12%. Recently-emerging non-fullerene acceptors have significantly accelerated this progress and boosted the performance of OSCs towards the 15% milestone. However, apart from the performance and stability, the production cost, especially the material cost, plays an essential role in determining the success and industrial viability of OSCs. In this analysis, we analyze step-by-step the efficiency, stability and cost potential for OSCs in one figure of merit, which allows us to directly compare the industrial viability of OSCs based on various material systems. Moreover, the analysis clearly suggests that organic semiconductors with low synthetic complexity, such as P3HT, would be the preferred choice for large-scale production and commercialization, if a promising and compatible acceptor is available.
