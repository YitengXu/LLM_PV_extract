1. Introduction
Plastic products with light weight, stable chemical properties, excellent insulating performance, and high specific strength are indispensable materials in daily production.1,2 According to the statistical research of Thakur et al.3 in 2022, the high demand for plastic has led to increasing global production, but most plastic waste ends up in incinerators or accumulates in landfills and the environment; only 15–18% of overall plastic is recycled. Based on this situation, plastic products are facing the problem of a large production volume with a low recovery rate. At present, the widely used plastic treatment methods4,5 are incineration, landfill disposal, degradation, and thermal cracking, while the recycling technology includes simple classification, recycling, and composite regeneration (Table 1). The garbage landfill method6 necessitates the treatment of numerous land resources, the blocking and pollution of groundwater, and the infiltration and waste of a large amount of recyclable plastic waste resources. The burning of harmful materials such as plastic releases large amounts of dioxins and furans, causing serious pollution to the environment. Moreover, long-term exposure to waste plastics in the environment also poses a health threat to humans.7 Notably, plastic waste tends to be decomposed into smaller particles that float in the air and enter the human body through the respiratory tract, which is more harmful to human health than the inhalation of automobile exhaust. As the diameter of microplastics continues to decrease, these particles enter the food chain and are subsequently absorbed by the human body, causing certain toxic effects on the human digestive, respiratory, immune, and reproductive systems.8 At the same time, plastics are valuable resources made from fossil fuels9 and can be converted into fuel under certain conditions.10 According to their chemical composition, plastics can be divided into polyolefin, acrylic ester, polyester, graft copolymer, polyurethane, halogenated plastics,11etc. (Table 2).

Under the dual pressures of environmental problems and a resource crisis, promoting the recycling of plastics is one of the most important ways to alleviate environmental pollution. With the proposal of the concepts of “carbon peak” and “carbon neutrality” in China, the recycling and comprehensive utilization of waste plastics have become one of the keys to solving environmental problems. Publications on the Web of Science database from 2010 to 2023 were searched by keywords (waste plastics as the primary keyword with supercapacitor, battery electrodes, phase change material, or fuel as the sub-keyword (Fig. 1a and b)). As shown in Fig. 1c, starting with the application of waste plastics in the field of energy storage, this paper discusses the conversion of waste plastics into porous materials for battery capacitor materials or phase change thermal energy storage materials and the direct conversion of plastics into hydrogen or other small molecule fuels to provide a reference for the high-value recovery and reuse of waste plastics.

2. Research progress of waste plastics in electrical energy storage
2.1 In the application of supercapacitors
As a carbon-chain-based polymer, plastic is mainly composed of carbon. Through physical (filtration, drying, stirring, etc.) or chemical (pyrolysis, activation, etc.) processing, plastic can be converted into carbon nanoparticles in a green and sustainable manner for resource exploitation. Nano-carbon materials offer excellent mechanical qualities, outstanding electrical conductivity, a large specific surface area, many functional groups on the surface, and a powerful capacity for charge adsorption.29 Therefore, one of the key ways to increase the value of waste plastics is to turn them into carbon nanomaterials for use as supercapacitor electrode materials.30 Supercapacitors, also known as electrochemical capacitors, are energy storage elements between batteries and conventional capacitors. Supercapacitors have farad-class super capacitance and high-power density and can realize high current charging and discharging up to 105 cycles.31 According to the different storage mechanisms of electric energy, supercapacitors can be divided into three types: double layer type, pseudo capacitor type, and battery type.32,33 Most of the electrode materials used in electric double-layer supercapacitors are porous carbon materials, including activated carbon (activated carbon powder, activated carbon fiber), carbon aerogel,34 carbon nanotubes (CNTs), etc., which give waste plastics an application in electricity storage. In the following, the application of carbon materials in capacitor electrodes will be classified by the microstructure of the carbon materials converted from waste plastics.

2.1.1 Hierarchical porous structure. 
The electrochemical performances of supercapacitors derived from porous carbon materials depend on the physical properties of the materials, such as the number and size of pores, specific surface area, and so on. The hierarchical porous structure of nanosheets provides a rapid diffusion path for electrolyte ions. Micropores increase the channels for electrolyte ions to enter and exit an electrode composed of nanosheets, so they are beneficial to improve the diffusion performance of electrolyte ions.35,36 Developing hierarchical porous carbon materials for supercapacitors is a good way to utilize waste plastics.
Wen et al.37 mixed PET from waste plastic bottles with organically modified montmorillonite (OMMT). Porous carbon nanosheets (PCNS) with a hierarchical porous structure were prepared by high-temperature pyrolysis, pickling, KOH activation, and other processes. In an organic electrolyte, a specific capacitance of 120 F g−1 was obtained at a current density of 0.2 A g−1 and a maximum energy density of 30.6 W h kg−1 was obtained at a current density of 0.1 A g−1. Besides PET, other waste plastics can also be used to make carbon materials. For example, Karakoti et al.38 used waste plastics as raw materials to produce graphene nanosheets through a two-stage pyrolysis process followed by pickling and drying. Liu et al.39 collected waste centrifuge tubes (composed of PP), used ferrocene and sulfur as combined catalysts, and very efficiently carbonized PP as CNS (Fig. 2a). After activation, the activated carbon nanosheets (ACNs) showed a distinct hierarchical porous structure, with a large specific surface area (3200 m2 g−1) and large porosity (3.7 cm3 g−1). The supercapacitor using ACNs as the electrode material exhibits a high specific capacitance of 349 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 current density. The fabricated symmetric supercapacitor exhibits an energy density of 23 W h kg−1 at a power density of 225 W kg−1.

In contrast with a single plastic material, a variety of waste plastics as raw materials can be applied, which is conducive to promoting the recycling of plastics as carbon materials. For example, Wen et al.40 used PP, PE, PS, PET, and PVC mixed waste plastic materials taken from common waste plastics. They were transformed into porous carbon nanosheets (PCNs) by catalytic carbonization and KOH activation after mixing with OMMT. The porous structure is shown in Fig. 2b. The synthesized PCNs had a layered structure, high specific surface area (2198 m2 g−1), and large porosity (3.0 cm3 g−1). The PCNs exhibit high specific capacitances of 120 F g−1 and 95 F g−1 at current densities of 0.1 A g−1 and 10 A g−1, respectively, in organic electrolytes. The HCl formed from the decomposition of PVC can be partially absorbed by the alkaline fillers in waste plastics, such as CaCO3 (a component of OMMT). HCl in the pyrolysis products of waste plastics can be subsequently removed using an aqueous NaOH solution.
The electrochemical performance of supercapacitors with porous carbon as the electrode is closely related to the pore structure. Increasing the pores (mesopores and micropores) on the surface of the material can provide a rapid diffusion path for electrolyte ions, which improves the electrochemical performance of the capacitor. Xu et al.41 introduced the hierarchical porous carbon PS. The excellent electrochemical performance of PS in supercapacitors is due to the compact aggregation of 30–50 nm carbon nanoparticles, forming an interconnected mesoporous and microporous network (Fig. 2c). Bai et al.42 studied the preparation of hierarchical porous carbon from a mixture of polyacrylonitrile (PAN) and konjac (a cash crop grown in Southeast Asia and Africa) at different proportions. The surface of the material has densely distributed holes forming a network structure (Fig. 2d). This supercapacitor made of carbon material also shows good electrochemical performance.
The electrochemical performance of supercapacitors can also be improved by doping N, P, or B atoms. Additional pseudo-capacitance can be generated due to the electrochemical activity of the doped atoms and the interaction between the electrolyte ions and the dopants. N-doping carbon materials for making supercapacitors can be made by carboning a mixture of plastic and nitrogen-containing materials, such as amines, melamine, ammonia, urea, and so on. For example, Zhang et al.43 used phenolic resin as the raw material, hexamethylenetetramine (HMTA) as the nitrogen source, and sodium citrate as the activator and mixed and calcined them at high temperature for 1 hour to obtain a nitrogen-doped layered porous material (Fig. 2e). Wang et al.44 used polyvinylidene fluoride powder as the raw material to prepare a nitrogen-doped hierarchical porous carbon material. First, they heated the metapolylidene fluoride powder in Ar gas at 600 °C for 3 h and obtained a black powder. Then, the material was activated using nitric acid and added to an aqueous urea solution (nitrogen source). The mixture was heated at 180 °C for 12 hours to obtain the nitrogen-doped hierarchical porous material (Fig. 2f). Using MoO3, Mg, and waste plastic pipettes as raw materials, Mir et al.45 prepared carbon-coated Mo2C hierarchical porous materials with excellent electrochemical performance.


2.1.2 Tubular structure. 
Tubular carbon materials have strong axial electron transport capacity, good electrical conductivity, large specific surface area, and stable chemical properties. They can intertwine with each other to form a network structure, which makes them an ideal material for supercapacitors.46
Due to the recent epidemic, respirator masks are widely used by people and they possess good recycling value. Yang et al.47 prepared CNTs from PP in waste respirator masks (Fig. 3a) and applied them as electrode materials in supercapacitors. They found that the yield and shape of the CNTs could be changed by adjusting the Ni/Fe molar ratio of the Ni–Fe bimetallic catalysts. When the Ni/Fe molar ratio reaches 3 (NiFe3), the PP is carbonized into a tubular structure with a diameter of 10–20 nm. When the current density is 1 A g−1, the specific capacitance of the supercapacitor with a CNT-NiFe3 electrode can reach 56.0 F g−1 with an energy density of 4.8 W h kg−1 at a power density of 900 W kg−1.
 Fig. 3  SEM images of (a) CNT-NiFe3, (b) CMS-0, (c) CNFs, (d) B2O3-20/PAN-based organic nanofibers.47–50 
Hu et al.48 used the same raw material to prepare a coarse tubular carbon material through solvent dissolution, KOH activation, and high-temperature pyrolysis (Fig. 3b). Supercapacitors made of carbon materials perform well in electrochemical testing because of their rich porous structure and large specific surface area. This supercapacitor has a specific capacitance of 328.9 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1 and an energy density of 10.4 W h kg−1 at a power density of 600 W kg−1.
Like hierarchical porous carbon materials, the electrochemical properties of carbon materials with tubular structures can also be improved by atom doping. For example, Chen et al.49 used 3-aminophenol/formaldehyde resin (3-AF) as the raw material to prepare template-free N-doped nanotubes through dissolution and high-temperature pyrolysis (Fig. 3c). The material has a large specific surface area and was used as a supercapacitor electrode with a large specific capacitance of 225 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1.
As the tubular structure has good electrochemical performance, the preparation of tubular carbon materials in a facile and economical way is highly in demand. Kim et al.50 fabricated nanotube carbon materials by first making shapes and then molding and carbonizing them. Nanofibers were fabricated by electrospinning using B2O3 and PAN solution (Fig. 3d). The spun nanotubes were shaped in an air environment at 280 °C and pyrolyzed in a nitrogen environment at 800 °C to produce tubular carbon materials. An asymmetric supercapacitor composed of carbon nanofibers exhibited a specific capacitance of 184.0 F g−1 at a current density of 1 mA cm−2 and an energy density of 20 W h kg−1 at a power density of 4000 W kg−1. Many researchers have studied the use of metal catalysts composed of transition metals in various molar ratios to improve production efficiency and control the shape and diameter of CNTs.51,52 For instance, Yang et al.53 studied the preparation of CNTs by chemical vapor precipitation. The length and diameter of the CNTs were controlled by changing the reaction temperature and time, the amount of catalyst, and the substrate material. Considering the problem of cost, Berkmans et al.54 investigated the preparation of CNTs by the arcing discharge process. This method does not require a catalyst or solvent and is more economical than the chemical vapor precipitation method.


2.1.3 Granular structure. 
Since the electrochemical performance of supercapacitors with carbonized materials as electrodes is related to the number and size of holes, as well as the specific surface area of the material, carbon materials with granular structure also show good performance in supercapacitor applications. For example, Zhou et al.55 used waste rigid PU foam as a raw material and obtained N-doped carbon material (NC) by primary pyrolysis at 700 °C. After the activation of NC with KOH, secondary pyrolysis at 700 °C and acid treatment, nitrogen-doped porous carbon material NHPC was obtained (Fig. 4a). NHPC has more pores and a larger specific surface area than NC. The supercapacitor exhibits a specific capacitance of 325 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1 using 6 M KOH as an electrolyte. At a power density of 250 W kg−1, the supercapacitor exhibits an energy density of 11.3 W h kg−1. The capacitance retention rate was 87.2% after 10000 cycles. Of course, waste rigid PU foam is not the only plastic raw material available. Machado et al.56 dissolved waste EPS and Fe(acac)3 in ethyl acetate, pyrolyzed it at 13 bars and 530 °C in Ar, mixed it with crushed solid KOH, and activated it at 800 °C under a nitrogen environment to produce magnetic activated carbon (MAC) (Fig. 4b). MAC exhibits better electrical properties than non-magnetized activated carbon: the supercapacitors exhibited a specific capacitance of 320 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1.
 Fig. 4  SEM images of (a) NHPC-2, (b) MAC, (c) HPC-2; FESEM images of (d) Ni-MOF after carbonization, (e) NiCo2O4@NC nanocomposite, (f) N-MC.55,56,58,61–63 
Compared with single structure, a hybrid structure carbon material has better performance. For instance, Lian et al.57 carbonized waste PE plastic bags, alkali magnesium carbonate, and graphite oxide mixed materials at 700 °C. PE is carbonized into clumped porous particles which act as a cushion for the graphene to prevent it from agglomerating. Consequently, the high specific surface area of graphene is fully used to promote the entrance of electrolytic ions into the inner layer. The supercapacitor exhibits a specific capacitance of 240 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1 using 6 M KOH as an electrolyte. At a power density of 250 W kg−1, the supercapacitor exhibits an energy density of 47.8 W h kg−1. Zhang et al.58 ground a LDPE and KOH mixture. The mixed material was pyrolyzed in a nitrogen environment at 700 °C and a layered granular carbon material was obtained after acid treatment, washing, and drying (Fig. 4c). The carbon material has a large specific surface area of 3059 m2 g−1. The supercapacitor exhibits a specific capacitance of 355 F g−1 at a current density of 0.2 A g−1 using 6 M KOH as electrolyte.
Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) are a new kind of porous crystal material composed of metal ions and organic chelates.59 It is easy to create granular materials with MOFs. Due to their high surface area and adjustable porosity, MOFs are promising materials for energy applications. The lack of conductivity and stability of MOFs limits their application in supercapacitors, but their performance can be improved by ion doping.60 For example, Al-Enizi et al.61 prepared NI-MOF from PET (from waste plastic bottles) and a Ni metal salt mixture. N-doped porous carbon NiOx nanoparticles (NiOx@NPC) were prepared by high-temperature pyrolysis (Fig. 4d). The composite has a high specific surface area of 1523 m2 g−1. The N-doped porous carbon enhances the charge mobility, improving the conductivity of the supercapacitor. Alhokbany et al.62 used PET (from waste plastic bottles) to obtain a solution of phthalic acid through depolymerization. The bimetallic Ni/Co MOF was prepared by mixing the phthalic acid solution with Ni–Co metal salt solution and heating it at 100 °C for 24 hours. Granular carbon nanoparticles (NiCo2O4@NC) were obtained via pyrolysis at 450 °C in a nitrogenous environment and at 230 °C in the atmospheric environment (Fig. 4e). The specific surface area of the material is 813 m2 g−1 and the diameter of the pores is about 15 nm. The supercapacitor exhibits a specific capacitance of 913 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1 using 6 M KOH as the electrolyte. Ubaidullah et al.63 also used PET as a raw material; after depolymerization, mixing with zinc nitrate hexahydrate and adding to a mixed solution of dimethylformamide and triethylamine, they got MOF-5 crystals. NC was obtained by pyrolysis of MOF-5 crystals in an Ar environment at 1000 °C (Fig. 4f). The supercapacitor exhibited a specific capacitance of 270 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1 using 6 M KOH as the electrolyte. The capacitance retention rate was 98% after 400 cycles.


2.1.4 Template structure. 
A template structure is a porous carbon structure created using the template carbonization method. There are two types of template carbonization: hard template and soft template.64,65 The difference between the two methods is the materials used to generate the template. A hard template is created using SiO2, polymer colloid, and so on, as the template material.66 A soft template obtains an ordered structure by treatment with the appropriate precursor materials and structural guides. Since the template will be removed later, we can use one template or more in the manufacturing process.
By using the “pyrolytic-deposition” method, Liang et al.67 converted PS into ordered mesoporous carbons (OMCs). PS was converted into carbon-containing gases by catalytic pyrolysis of Fe(NO3)3 in a tubular furnace and these gases were adsorbed into mesoporous SBA-15 (mesoporous molecular sieve) and converted into solid carbon materials. The OMCs copied the form of the SBA-15 template, forming an ordered mesoporous structure. The manufacturing process is shown in Fig. 5. OMCs had the highest specific surface area (1156 m2 g−1) and porosity (1.23 cm3 g−1) when the mass ratio of PS to Fe-SBA-15 was 1. The supercapacitor exhibited a specific capacitance of 118 F g−1 at a current density of 0.2 A g−1 using 6 M KOH as the electrolyte. After 5000 cycles, the capacitance retention rate was 87.2%.
 Fig. 5  Process of OMC preparation based on pyrolysis and deposition method.67 
In addition to their use as mesoporous molecular sieves, MgO, CaCO3, and SiO2 are also commonly used as hard templates. For example, Min et al.68 used MgO with a sheet structure as a template to pyrolyze waste PS at 700 °C. The template was removed with hydrochloric acid to prepare a porous carbon flake (PCF). KMnO4 and PCF were mixed and dissolved in ethanol, then filtered and dried to obtain PCF-MnO2. The PCF-MnO2 hybrid had excellent electrochemical properties with a specific capacitance of 247 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1. In the symmetric capacitor, the capacitance retention rate was 93.4% after 10000 cycles at 10 A g−1 current density. Ma et al.69 introduced the fabrication of PCNs using PS and MgO (Fig. 6a and b). Jiang et al.70 prepared a porous carbon particle material with Teflon and CO(NH2)2 as the raw materials and CaCO3 as the hard template (Fig. 6c). Ma et al.71 prepared three-dimensional porous materials with PP and CO(NH2)2 as the raw materials and Fe2O3 particles as the hard template (Fig. 6d and e). Zhang et al.72 prepared porous carbon materials using PS as the carbon source and SiO2 as the hard template. Urgunde et al.73 introduced carbonizing PS with a sugar cube as the template to produce carbon materials under the catalysis of Ni. Carbon materials have been widely used in the manufacturing of supercapacitors.

The advantage of the template method is that the product can replicate the structure of the template, so it can be made into carbon materials of various structures. Wang et al.74 used flower-like ZnO as the template and asphalt as the carbon raw material. After pyrolysis and hydrochloric acid treatment, the template was removed and the material was activated with KOH solution to produce flower-like hierarchical porous carbon (FHPC), as shown in Fig. 6f. Because of its unique structure, supercapacitors using the FHPC as electrodes had excellent electrochemical properties. The composite electrode in the three-electrode device demonstrated a specific capacitance of 284 F g−1 at a scanning rate of 2 mV s−1.
In this part, we introduced different structures of carbon materials made from waste plastic, including hierarchical porous, tubular, granular, and template materials. These materials were used to make electrodes for supercapacitors and showed different performances (Table 3). Usually, converting plastics into carbon materials requires two processes, namely pyrolysis and activation, in which waste gas and CO are produced.39,43 After activation, an acid solution and deionized water are used to wash the carbon materials, producing waste water. The waste gas and water are of further concern. Some researchers have made carbon materials without activation. These have easier manufacturing processes but unsatisfactory performances.38,47 In order to simplify the reaction processes, some researchers completed pyrolysis and activation in one step,55,58 termed the “one-pot synthesis method”. The supercapacitors made with these materials showed good performances. The advantage of the template method is that the product can replicate the structure of the template, so carbon materials can be made into various structures. However, the template method requires extra energy input as a template removal process is required, which makes it somewhat less satisfactory compared with the one-pot synthesis method.

2.2 Application in battery electrodes
With rising energy demand, there is an urgent need for high-energy and high-power density electrochemical energy storage systems. Traditional batteries have high energy density and operating voltage but poor cyclability and power density. Supercapacitors feature high power density (which allows for high current charge and discharge) and can be cycled up to 105 times. However, they have the disadvantage of low energy density.82 As a result, some researchers are investigating batteries that combine battery electrodes and capacitor electrodes which may combine the benefits of batteries and supercapacitors.
Xu et al.83 used PP from discarded plastic bags as a carbon source to create N- and S-doped carbon nanosheets (NPCNs). Because doped N/S atoms can expand the interlayer spacing of the material, improve ion capacity, and introduce more redox sites for NPCNs, NPCN anodes have ideal K+ storage properties. In electrochemical testing, the hybrid battery with NPCNs as the negative electrode and commercial activated carbon as the positive electrode had excellent performance. At a current density of 0.1 A g−1, the supercapacitor has a specific capacitance of 69.1 mA h g−1. The supercapacitor exhibited energy densities of 137.5 W h kg−1 at 200.4 W kg−1 power density and 61.0 W h kg−1 at 36576 W kg−1 power density. The capacitance retention was 87% after 6000 cycles.
Kumar et al.84 carbonized and activated recycled styrene acrylonitrile (SAN) plastic from printers to produce activated carbon for use as the active material in the negative electrode of sodium-ion batteries. Fonseca et al.85 recycled PS from coffee cups as a carbon source and prepared carbon materials by pyrolysis as negative electrode materials for sodium-ion batteries. Pol et al.86 used PS derived from waste plastics as a carbon source and carbonized it into granular and tubular materials in a nitrogen environment at 700 °C to prepare a negative electrode for lithium-ion batteries. Sun et al.87 converted the PET extracted from waste plastic bottles into PET particles through dissolution and heat treatment and used them as negative electrode materials for Li-ion batteries.
Metal oxide systems are important components of electrode materials. Das et al.88 synthesized PbO-C composites from waste lead-acid batteries and HDPE plastic. The specific capacitance and energy density of the PbO-C composite cell at 0.1 V s−1 were 115.3 F g−1 and 70.6 W h kg−1, respectively. PbO-C nanocomposite was made from plastic waste and lead-acid batteries and outperformed conventional lead-acid batteries in terms of energy storage.
This section summarizes the preparation of carbon materials using waste plastics as carbon sources and their application as the negative electrode of hybrid batteries (Table 5). Compared with conventional batteries (lead-acid batteries,89,90 lithium–oxygen batteries91,92), some hybrid batteries have higher power density and more charging and discharging cycles.83 The good performance of hybrid batteries meets the current energy demand.

3. Converting waste plastics into fuel or hydrogen
Waste plastics with high calorific value and high hydrocarbon content have the potential to be converted into hydrogen and other fuels.94–96 The conversion of waste plastics into high-value-added fuel products and hydrogen could effectively alleviate the current energy shortage problem97,98 and is a more efficient, environmentally friendly, and economical way to dispose of waste plastics in line with the current societal push for environmental protection.99 The following section describes the latest research progress on the conversion of waste plastics into hydrogen energy and fuel products.
3.1 Converting waste plastic into hydrogen
H2 is an energy carrier with high efficiency, sustainability, and great development potential. Only water is generated when H2 is burned, which is eco-friendly, and it can be widely used in various industries with great economic benefits.100–102 H2 is an important carrier for the future construction of a diversified energy supply system based on clean energy. Thus, hydrogen energy development and utilization technology have become important directions for new progress in global energy technology.103–105 The conversion of waste plastics into hydrogen energy can effectively recycle plastics while also producing high-value products. Today, there are several approaches to the conversion of waste plastics into hydrogen energy. First, waste plastics are converted into H2 output, both as a by-product in the preparation of CNTs and directly as the main product. Secondly, waste plastics are converted into H2-rich gases such as synthesis gas and H2-rich alkyne gas which are further converted into hydrogen energy. Some teams have used modeling analysis and numerical simulation to predict the process of H2 production from waste plastics in order to obtain the best reaction parameters for specific experimental research.
Currently, pyrolysis is an efficient way to convert waste plastics into H2 and the choice of catalysts is the key to the pyrolysis reaction, as the right catalyst can not only shorten the reaction time and lower the reaction temperature, but also ensure an enhanced conversion rate and product selectivity106 that greatly improve the economic efficiency of the overall recycling process. In addition, the use of catalysts can also reduce or even stop the production of some harmful substances,107 giving this recovery process feature desirable environmental benefits.108

3.1.1 Co-production of carbon nanomaterials and H2. 
Much research has shown that, when using catalysts for the pyrolysis of waste plastics, a certain amount of byproduct gas is generated which is H2-rich and can be further converted into energy. Therefore, it has a high potential for use and research value.
A byproduct of carbon nanotube production, H2 is frequently not produced as pure H2, but instead as a mixture. The current focus of research is on how to increase the yield of CNTs while also increasing the yield of mixture gas. Bajad et al.109 used Ni/Mo/MgO catalyst to convert mixed plastic wastes into CNT and H2-rich hydrocarbon gas in a multinuclear reactor. The mixed plastic waste consisted of HDPE (67.2 wt%), PP (11.2 wt%), PS (6.2 wt%), PVC (5.2 wt%), and PET (10.2 wt%). Using Box-Behnken 3-stage and 4-dialyzer design methods, process parameters such as pyrolysis temperature, CNT synthesis temperature, reaction time, and cycle ratio were optimized. The results showed that using 60 g of plastic waste and 1 g of catalyst, 6.6 g of CNTs and hydrocarbon gas with a 78% H2 content could be produced. It was also found that the cycle ratio and pyrolysis temperature had considerable effects on the yields of CNTs and product gas (Fig. 7). It is worth noting that, during the pyrolysis process, the HCl yield is about 52 wt% based on the initial weight of PVC in the mixed plastic waste. The theoretical chlorine content of PVC is 56.8%. This reveals that chlorine liberated from the dehydrochlorination of PVC waste was almost entirely removed as HCl. Yao et al.110 synthesized a series of bimetallic catalysts such as Co–Fe, Co–Ni, and Fe–Ni using magnesium oxide as a catalyst carrier and evaluated the activity of each bimetallic catalyst. The results showed that Fe–Ni–Mg prepared by the increasing the pH precipitation method had the best plastic conversion performance, with a maximum CNM yield of 30.25 wt% and an H2 yield of 31.5 mmol gplastic−1. The H2 yield from LDPE bag waste was relatively high, measuring 35.3 mmol gplastic−1. Following that, the researchers investigated the mechanism of the effect of NiFe bimetallic catalysts on the production of high-value CNTs from clean H2 in the pyrolysis of waste plastics111,112 and the composition of the catalyst parameters. The results showed that when the ratio of Ni:Fe was 1:3, the maximum concentration and yield of H2 were 73.9 vol% and 84.7 mg gplastic−1, respectively. Yang et al.113 used an impregnation method with different calcination atmospheres to create Ni/Al2O3 catalysts. Methane thermal chemical vapor deposition was used to investigate the effects of various Ni/Al2O3 catalysts on CNT growth. The yield of CNTs catalyzed by H–Ni/Al2O3 was 24.3% and the rate of H2 production was 325.4 mmol gplastic−1 per hour at 680 °C.
 Fig. 7  Three-dimensional response plots showing the effects of reaction time (min), pyrolysis temperature (°C), CNT synthesis temperature (°C), and recycle ratio (%) on the H2 yield (vol%).109 
Some researchers have discovered that, by selecting appropriate catalysts and reaction conditions, plastics can generate H2 during the gasification stage, eliminating the step of purification in the gas mixture utilization stage and greatly improving gas utilization. For example, Wu et al.114 investigated the catalytic pyrolysis reaction technique using steam and a Ni–Mn–Al catalyst and the pyrolytic reforming of HDPE waste with a Ni–Mn–Al catalyst; a steam reforming temperature of 800 °C yielded approximately 94.4 mmol H2 per gplastic. The total carbon yield was reduced by steam injection during the catalytic steam pyrolysis reforming. His group continued to investigate the sustainable processing of waste plastics to produce high-yield H2-rich syngas and high-quality CNTs115via steam gasification using Ni/Ca–Al and Ni/Zn–Al catalysts in a two-stage reaction system. In the presence of Ni/Ca–Al catalysts, a potential H2 production of approximately 34.1 vol% (volume of H2 produced divided by maximum theoretical H2 production) was obtained. It was shown that the production of 1 ton of CNTs per day could produce about 16800 Nm3 day−1 of H2. Yao et al.116 used a pyrolysis-catalytic process to produce CNTs from waste plastics while yielding a large amount of H2 as a by-product with a yield of 38.1 mmol H2 per gplastic. Their team investigated the effects of various catalysts on the products and discovered that the Ni–Fe/MCM41 catalyst had the highest catalytic activity. The Ni–Fe alloy with dispersed particles was considered to be the key to promoting the decomposition of carbon precursors and the subsequent precipitation to form CNTs. The large particle size of the NiFe/Beta catalyst caused an irregular carbon shape which reduced the purity and graphitization of nanotubes. Yang et al.117 produced CNTs and H2 by gasification of waste plastics in a two-stage fluidized catalytic bed (Fig. 8). Their Ni/Al-SBA-15 and NiCu/CaOeSiO2 catalysts were synthesized and pelletized in the first and second-stage reactors, respectively, and used for CNT synthesis and H2 production. It was shown that the two-stage fluidized catalytic bed gasification system exhibited the best performance, with high fractions of CNTs and H2 with an equivalent ratio of 0.1, when the temperatures of the first and second-stage reactors were controlled at 600 °C and 800 °C, respectively. After that, his team continued to study the effect of temperature and equivalence ratio on the reaction,118 further optimizing the previous findings to increase the yield with minimal energy consumption, and found that controlling the reaction temperature of the fluidized bed at 600 °C with an ER of 0.1 and upgrading the gasification product through a catalytic fixed-bed reactor at 680 °C exhibited the best catalytic performance, with a yield of less defective CNTs of 22.0% and H2 productivity of 385.1 mmol (h gcatalyst)−1.
 Fig. 8  Schematic diagram of the mechanism for CNT and H2 co-production from waste plastic gasification in a two-stage fluidized catalytic bed system.117 
In addition, the yields of CNTs and H2 can be well regulated by changing the catalyst components or reaction conditions. Nahil et al.119 investigated the effect of metal addition to nickel-based catalysts on the conversion of waste plastics into CNTs and H2 and discovered that the Ni–Mn–Al catalyst was the most promising for the co-production of H2 and CNTs, with an H2 yield of 71.4 mmol H2 per gplastic. Furthermore, the effect of the vapor injection rate of the Ni–Mn–Al catalyst on the yields of H2 and CNTs was investigated and it was discovered that increasing the vapor injection rate could significantly improve the yield of H2 while decreasing carbon deposition; conversely, decreasing the vapor injection rate could improve the carbon nanotube quality. Cai et al.120 investigated the effects of different Fe/Al2O3 ratios on H2 chloride production and discovered that the amount of H2 in the gaseous product increased sharply as the Fe ratio was increased, as did the number of carbon deposits on the catalyst. It reached a maximum of 82 vol% and the maximum yield of CNTs is about 42 wt% at a ratio of 1:1.
It is important to note that there are two main types of chlorine present in PVC after pyrolysis, one is C–Cl bonds in the resulting tar and the other is the formation of HCl. The presence of a catalyst (metal oxide) can prevent or accelerate the removal of HCl from PVC. The effectiveness of metal oxides in inhibiting HCl formation is mainly reflected in their ability to precipitate HCl by adsorption, which depends on the basicity of the metal oxides. In addition, the effect of metal oxides on the removal of elemental Cl from PVC pyrolysis tar products is different from that on PVC.121,122 Since Fe2O3 can weaken the C–Cl bond in organic compounds, the effect of removing elemental Cl from tar is more significant and stable, but the removal of elemental Cl from PVC will be gradually poisoned and deactivated by the action of HCl.123 If the PVC contains alkaline setting additives such as OMMT, HCl can be absorbed by them, thus reducing the contaminating properties.40 Alternatively, carbonates such as CaO/Ca(OH)2 or calcium carbonate are added to the reaction mixture to absorb the generated HCl with the aim of reducing the chlorine content of the product.124,125 It is important to note that the presence of PVC in the pyrolysis material may produce more polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins, dioxin-like PCBs, and polychlorinated dibenzofurans due to the addition of catalysts or oxygen. Therefore, it is necessary to reduce the content of PVC in plastic pyrolysis, either by reducing or isolating the oxygen or by optimizing the catalyst, to reduce the emission of harmful substances.126


3.1.2 Production of H2-rich gas and other by-products. 
For direct conversion of waste plastics into H2, steam reforming, co-pyrolysis, and catalytic pyrolysis are commonly used today. The methods for the direct conversion of waste plastics into H2 are summarized and classified below, and a summary table has been created (Table 7).
Steam reforming generally refers to the reaction of hydrocarbons with water to produce synthesis gas, usually using natural gas as a feedstock, for the main purpose of H2 production.127,128 Nowadays, through continuous research, it is possible to steam reform waste plastics as a feedstock with high conversion rates, making it one of the most valuable methods for utilizing waste plastics. The catalytic deconstruction of plastics triggered by microwaves can extract more than 97% of the theoretical mass of H2.129 The conversion to H2 or syngas has a great economic benefit and the overall process has a high H2 production rate and economic efficiency. In addition, conversion to H2 effectively reduces the environmental pollution associated with the disposal of plastics by conventional means.108,130,131 A British company, Powerhouse Energy Group, developed a DMG (distributed modular gasification) technology that can directly convert waste plastics into H2 and other clean energy sources through high-temperature gasification and catalytic reaction with no need for converting waste plastics into fuel in advance. Nabgan et al.132 investigated selective H2 production from PET by a steam reforming process using a Ni/Pd-impregnated Al2O3–La2O3 catalyst. The catalysts were characterized using XRD, etc. The results showed that the Ni–Pd-impregnated Al2O3–La2O3 catalysts had good activity and long-term stability. At 800 °C, the maximum feed conversion of phenolic steam reforming was 96.6% using a Ni–Pd/Al–La catalyst. The highest H2 yield was 64.8% at a flow rate of 0.45 ml min−1, with a catalyst dosage of 0.2 g and a reaction temperature of 800 °C. Wu et al.133 studied H2 production from different waste plastics in a two-stage pyrolysis gasification reactor. The results showed that at an 800 °C gasification temperature, PS (59.6 wt%) and HDPE (53.5 wt%) had lower gas production (11.2 wt%) than waste plastics (45.5 wt%) for non-catalytic non-steam pyrolysis gasification (Fig. 9); the team also used a two-stage catalytic steam pyrolysis-gasification process for H2 production.134 The experimental results verified that H2 production increased from 0.015 g H2 per gwaste plastic to 0.26 g H2 per g when the gasification temperature and water injection rate were 800 °C and 4.7 g min−1, respectively. Aminu et al.135 used a novel two-stage pyrolysis-low temperature (250 °C) plasma-catalyzed steam reforming process to produce H2 from PE. To generate H2, they used catalytic steam reforming with gases from plastic pyrolysis in the presence of low-temperature non-thermal plasma. It was shown that all three methods, adding the catalyst, increasing the power of the plasma, and adding steam to the ionophore catalytic process, can increase the H2 yield (Fig. 10). Although the H2 yield is lower than that of the thermal catalytic process, the low temperature used in this system can be viewed as an alternative method of producing H2 from waste HDPE.

Additionally, it has been discovered that H2 can be produced alongside other high-value products like fuels and formates with the right materials and catalysts via steam reforming. Nabgan et al.136,137 produced a Ni–Co/CeO2 nanocatalyst for the steam reforming and cracking of PET and phenol to produce H2 and fuel; they also carefully examined the steam reforming reaction mechanism of PET waste and phenol. Specifically, the differences between Ni–Co/CeO2 catalysts prepared by impregnation and hydrothermal treatment methods were investigated. The hydrothermal route resulted in higher catalyst activity and stability that prevented the formation of byproducts and had better phenol conversion and H2 yield. It was found that several types of reactions occurred during the catalytic reforming of PET, such as dehydrogenation, thermal cracking, steam-reforming, etc. This research provided specific methods and ideas for steam reforming reactions of waste plastics with phenol. Farooq et al.138 investigated the effects of different catalysts on the steam gasification of linear LDPE (LLDPE) to H2-rich gas and the specific process of conversion. The order of selectivity of different catalysts for H2 was Ni/CeO2–ZrO2 > Ni/CeO2 > Ni/Al2O3 (Fig. 11). Due to the fine dispersion of smaller nickel crystals on the carrier and the formation of Ce1–xZrxO2-d solid solutions of the Ni/CeO2–ZrO2 catalyst, the catalytic H2 selectivity of this catalyst was as high as 76%. Most of the generated CO is converted to CO2, accelerating H2 production. The whole process exhibits the advantages of a high conversion rate and environmental friendliness. Lin et al.139 investigated the facile electrodeposition synthesis of a nickel-phosphorus nanosphere (nanoNi-P) as a catalyst for H2 generation, water oxidation, and PET reforming that was able to convert PET to formate with high selectivity (faradaic efficiency = ∼100%); the efficient and selective generation of H2 and formate from PET reforming was achieved using a photoelectrochemical platform. This work provides an idea for the development of artificial leaves, turning waste plastics into renewable fuels and photosynthetic chemicals with great environmental value and potential for sustainable development.
 Fig. 11  (a) Gas selectivity (vol%), (b) product yields (wt%).138 
On the other hand, steam reforming can be used to further enhance the H2 yield by exploiting the synergistic effect of co-gasification between waste plastics and other substances. Cao et al.140 investigated the co-gasification of plastic waste and soda lignin in supercritical water and, for waste plastics without soda lignin, the gasification efficiency varied from class to class, with PE > PC ≈ PP > ABS. The reformation of CH4 and C2H6 from the depolymerization of plastics (particularly PE and PP plastics) could be catalyzed by soda lignin due to the presence of bases, which increases the H2 yield.
In addition to steam reforming, catalytic pyrolysis or co-pyrolysis of waste plastics can be carried out by different catalysts to induce the conversion of waste plastics into small-molecule materials with H2. Huo et al.141 investigated the catalytic pyrolysis of LDPE with activated carbon and magnesium oxide as catalysts to produce H2 and other fuels. The combination of biomass-derived activated carbon and magnesium oxide as catalysts had a synergistic effect on the distribution of gaseous products and promoted the production of H2, obtaining gaseous fractions with up to 94.8 vol% hydrogen. Grimaldos-Osorio et al.142 used methyl valerate as a model molecule that contains functional groups similar to PMMA. The generation of H2 from the cleavage of ester groups established a starting point for the electrocatalytic conversion of methyl pivalate which was extended to the generation of H2 from the cleavage of waste PMMA plastics. Wang et al.143 extracted a biochar catalyst from nanocellulose that catalyzes the conversion of waste plastics to H2 with liquid fuels. They found that a lower temperature and a higher biochar to LDPE ratio were favorable to increase the production of H2, but at the expense of the light gases CnHm, especially CH4. Under optimal conditions, LDPE can be completely degraded into liquid and high purity H2-rich gas without other harmful by-products. Biomass has the advantages of wide availability, simple preparation, efficient catalysis, and no acid or base active agent required in the synthesis process.144 Moreover, the biomass catalyst can be reused uneventfully. Therefore, the catalyst synthesis process and the pyrolysis process of waste plastics are both environmentally friendly when using suitable biomass as a pyrolysis catalyst. However, these methods face problems of high temperature and high energy consumption. Tests have shown that this method can truly convert waste plastics, such as grocery bags and packaging bags, into valuable liquid fuels and H2-rich gases. Wu et al.145 prepared a Co/SiO2@HZSM-5 core–shell catalyst that can catalyze the production of H2 from syngas produced by the gasification of waste plastics. The amount of HZSM-5 in the catalyst is an important factor affecting H2 production (Fig. 12). The catalyst has high stability and good catalytic ability; the catalytic time can reach more than 15 hours and the highest conversion efficiency reaches 90%. It provides a good idea for the future application of core–shell catalysts in H2 production.

In catalytic pyrolysis, light can be used as a catalyst for the reaction in addition to a chemical catalyst. Luo et al.146 investigated the photocatalytic pyrolysis reaction of LDPE by a bifunctional photothermal catalyst (Fig. 13). This reaction can convert waste plastics into H2 with jet fuel. They introduced and explored six catalysts using in situ fixed-bed reactors heated by a solar simulator at 500 °C of which the Ni–Ti–Al catalyst had the best photocatalytic performance. This research provides a good idea for the photocatalytic conversion of waste plastics. To compare the characteristics of the methods, we have summarized the catalysts, products and the advantages of each method in Table 6. The aim is to provide a valid reference for future development in the conversion of waste plastics to H2.

3.1.3 Converted to syngas. 
Syngas, with carbon monoxide and H2 as the main components, is an important raw material for organic synthesis and an important source of H2, giving it a particularly significant position in the industry. In recent years, mankind has started to use syngas as an alternative energy source147,148 and the conversion of waste plastics into high-value-added syngas has become a highly promising approach for sustainable development. Recent research advances in the preparation of syngas from waste plastics are presented below.
The main methods of converting waste plastics into syngas today are catalytic pyrolysis and co-pyrolysis. Bobek-Nagy et al.149 obtained H2-rich syngas by co-pyrolysis of pine sawdust and LDPE. The effects of water and nickel content on the H2 yield were investigated and the results showed that the highest H2 yield (456.8 mmol gplastic−1) was obtained at a water sample ratio of 15.00 for the same nickel content. The highest level of H2 production (392.8 mmol gplastic−1) was obtained with a Ni-AC catalyst with a 10% Ni mass fraction at constant water content. Saad et al.150,151 used two-stage pyrolytic catalytic reforming of waste plastics (LDPE, HDPE, PS, PET, PP) to produce high-quality syngas composed of H2 and carbon monoxide. The process consists of two steps: the pyrolysis of plastics in the first stage and catalytic reforming with CO2 and steam as reformers in the second stage. The effects of catalyst use and CO2 to steam ratio on syngas quality were studied. Without the catalyst, the dry reforming of waste plastic pyrolysate with CO2 significantly increases the gas yield of plastic to more than 90%. The use of Ni–Co–Al catalysts significantly increased the yields of H2 and carbon monoxide in the syngas, with the highest yield from LDPE at 154.7 mmol syngas per gplastic using catalyst with carbon dioxide dry reforming. Adding Ni–Mg/Al2O3 catalyst to the steam increased the percentage of H2 in the syngas. The addition of Ni–Co/Al2O3 catalyst to the steam can increase the proportion of carbon monoxide (Fig. 14), while adjusting the amount of steam can manipulate the molar ratio of H2/CO. The quality of the syngas can be precisely controlled by controlling the amount of catalyst and steam to meet the standards for industrial use. Hu et al.152 first proposed the conversion of plastic waste into syngas in a two-zone reactor by a Fe2AlOx-based chemical cycling technique. The Fe2AlOx-based redox cycle achieves the pyrolysis of plastic waste with hydrocarbon vapor decomposition and thermal cracking in the upper zone of the dual-zone reactor and oxidation and hydrocracking in the lower zone (850 °C). This method was able to achieve a higher carbon conversion (81%) and syngas concentration (92.8%) compared to the mixed-feed process. The H2 yield was as high as 85.8 mm g−1 HDPE at a H2/CO ratio of 2.0. This research provides good ideas and methods for the sustainable conversion of waste plastics into high-value chemicals.

3.1.4 Numerical simulation analysis. 
Due to the complexity and high cost of conducting repeated experiments or the limiting environmental conditions of the experiments, numerical simulation may be a good choice to analyze and predict the reactions of waste plastics conversion. Mojaver et al.153 modeled the steam gasification of PE, PP, PC, and PET wastes to investigate the effects of key characteristics, such as steam to plastic waste ratio, temperature, water content, and pressure, on the composition of the produced H2-rich syngas and the breakdown rate of the blastomere, as studied and optimized using the Taguchi method. The results showed that the steam gasification of PP had the highest hydrogen production under all processing conditions. The optimal reaction conditions were a 1.75 steam/plastic waste ratio, 1300 K temperature, 10% humidity, and 400 kPa pressure. Under optimum conditions, the hydrogen production rate was 66.7% and the breakdown rate was 54.9 kW. Cortazar et al.154 analyzed the potential of hydrogen production from waste plastics in pyrolysis and online oxidative steam reforming by numerical simulation using a thermodynamic equilibrium approach based on Gibbs free energy minimization. First, the roles of temperature, steam/plastic ratio, and equivalence ratio in HDPE pyrolysis volatiles reforming were analyzed. Next, the optimal conditions for the oxidative reforming of HDPE, PP, PS, PET blends, and biomass/HDPE blends of pyrolysis products were determined. A good reference is provided for the specific experiments conducted. Ayodele et al.155 used machine learning algorithms to model and predict the gasification of plastic and rubber wastes for hydrogen production and obtained four optimal network configurations for the most suitable ANNs models with topologies of 4–16–1, 4–20–1, 4–17–1 and 4–3–1 for radial basis function with standard activation function, radial basis function with ordinary activation function, single-layer MLP, and double-layer MLP. The 1-LMLP algorithm and importance analysis can be used to determine the parameters that may affect hydrogen production when considering various feedstocks and to design a scaled-up combined gasifier. Hasanzadeh et al.156 explored PE waste gasification syngas analysis and multi-objective optimization using a central composite design to optimize the required heat and exothermic efficiency, after performing multi-objective optimization. The results showed that the optimal steam to PE waste ratio was 1 and the optimal reaction temperature was 700 °C. Under optimal conditions, the heat required to recover a unit of molar PE was only 213.7 kJ, while the energy efficiency was as high as 95.4%. Singh et al.157 used Aspen Plus to simulate the biomass-plastic co-gasification process in a fluidized bed reactor, where the gasification of biomass and plastic resulted in a higher H2 content in the syngas compared to pure biomass gasification. Different process parameters have a significant impact on the product gas composition and syngas calorific value obtained from biomass-plastic co-gasification and the team obtained the optimal process parameters through simulations. The simulation work showed the synergy between the biomass and plastics in the production of H2-rich syngas. The results of this research can be used as a guide for renewable energy and waste conversion.
With the development of modern computers, numerical simulations are now used in many fields158,159 and allow more repetitions of experiments with the same amount of time spent, producing more experimental data and also avoiding errors due to operations and other reasons. The results of numerical simulations can be used as a specific reference during experiments, bringing great convenience to experiments.
In all waste plastic to H2 conversion processes, pollution is usually generated by two parts, the first being the catalyst preparation stage. The choice of a suitable method for catalyst preparation can reduce unnecessary energy consumption and environmental pollution.160 The second is the plastic pyrolysis stage and the key to this stage is the reactor design. A suitable reactor can first simplify the operation, increase the reaction rate and make good contact between the reactants and catalysts.133 Secondly, it can separate the plastic from impurities and avoid the contact between impurities and catalysts that leads to catalyst deactivation. In addition, most catalytic pyrolysis processes change the activity of catalysts that cannot be reused which will cause secondary contamination without timely disposal.161 It should be noted that, in addition to H2, CO, CO2, CH4, and other gases are also produced during the recycling process.141

3.2 Converting waste plastics into fuel products
Since plastics are combustible as organic materials, they can also be used directly as fuel products.162,163 In addition, plastics and petroleum-derived fuels are hydrocarbons. The main difference between these hydrocarbons is that plastic molecules have longer carbon chains than those of LPG, petrol, and diesel fuels.96,164 In recent years, waste plastics have been converted into fuel mainly by heat treatment technology and oxidation technology to convert the organic components in the waste plastics into high-value refined products; the novel methods are summarized in Table 8 and Fig. 16. Today, there are practical applications for domestic plastic waste as fuel, such as waste incineration for power generation.165,166

Direct incineration of waste plastics produces a large number of harmful emissions such as dioxins and CO; in particular, direct combustion of PVC generates HCl, which is very harmful to humans.122 In addition to the plastic itself, the additives in the plastic produce a large number of harmful chemicals after high temperature volatilization or chemical decomposition.167,168 Similar to the incineration of plastics, pyrolysis can also produce harmful emissions such as dioxins. In particular, PVC plastics produce dioxin-like PCBs, dioxins, HCl, and other harmful gases. However, pyrolysis can be performed in certain ways to reduce the emission of harmful substances.126 For example, the combined pyrolysis of oil sludge and PVC can effectively prevent the formation of polychlorinated dibenzofurans, which can be advantageous in inhibiting the formation of dioxins.16 Alternatively, the hazardous substances can be converted into solid waste for subsequent disposal by pyrolysis. For example, by using a torrefaction technique, volatile liquid dioxins can be reduced by approximately 97% and the amount of fixed dioxins in solid products can be increased by 90.7%.169
Therefore, recycling waste plastics into fuel might be a more efficient, economical, and environmentally friendly method than direct combustion.170 It is worth noting that a quantitative assessment of the impact of pyrolysis versus incineration of waste plastics can be useful in promoting the use of pyrolysis in the recycling of waste plastics in the future. For example, pyrolysis of waste plastics can produce a liquid oil of more than 90 wt% which has similar characteristics to conventional diesel fuel, giving it great economic value.171,172 The catalytic cracking process allows for higher product selectivity, reducing unnecessary harmful by-products and negative environmental impacts.173 Currently, Cynar Plc in the UK and BrightMark in the US have achieved industrial production of fuel from waste plastics with high efficiency and environmental protection.

3.2.1 Converted to solid fuel. 
Waste plastic itself can be used as fuel, but when used directly as fuel, there are problems with fuel quality and pollution and the actual utilization rate is not high, so conversion into fuel has become a method of high-value recycling of waste plastics. Solid fuel is convenient to store and occupies a large proportion of the conversion of waste plastics. Hibino et al.174 fabricated a high-performance solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) which can use plastic waste directly as fuel. The peak power densities of the obtained SOFC were 0.7, 0.7, and 0.6 W cm−2 for nylon 66, PE, and PS, respectively. Compared with low-temperature fuel cells, SOFC has advantages in terms of energy efficiency, fuel flexibility, and solid fuel performance. Chow et al.175 studied the photo-accelerated decomposition of three energetic plastic materials made of PE, PP, and PVC waste plastics. Among the activated polymers (PESO3-Fe, PPSO3-Fe, and PVCSO3-Fe), all underwent Fenton decomposition (Fig. 15). The optimum parameters for photo-triggered oxidation of the activated polymers were 100.0 mmol g−1 H2 peroxide, 400 W UV-Vis lamp, a pH of 7, and a reaction time of 80 min. Among the polymers, PVCSO3-Fe generated the most heat in the decomposition reaction, while PPSO3-Fe generated the most pressure. An efficient method was provided for the chemical treatment of unrecycled plastic waste for power generation. Rebecca Fushimi et al.176 investigated a new process for the conversion of waste PE into chemicals and fuels using catalytic pyrolysis with comparative experiments in a TAP reactor and showed that catalytic-assisted vacuum pyrolysis of PE favors a change in the selectivity of aromatic products such as benzene, toluene, and xylene over non-catalytic methods. Chiemchaisri et al.177 used solid waste from landfills as refuse-derived fuel (RDF). The RDF was formed by adding a binding agent (cassava root) to the waste plastic for the briquette. The maximum plastic content of the RDF coal was limited to 55% to maintain physical strength and maximum chlorine content. The gas produced in a drop-in gasifier had an average energy content of 1.8 MJ m−3.

3.2.2 Converted to liquid fuel. 
In addition to solid fuels, converting waste plastics into liquid fuels is an important way to use waste plastics as fuel. Sharuddin et al.173 investigated the pyrolytic and thermocatalytic degradation processes of plastics and the key factors affecting the end products. It was shown that PS degrades easily, does not require a catalyst to accelerate the reaction, and yields 97 wt% oil, making it the best pyrolytic material with the highest liquid oil yield of all plastics. Kaimal et al.178 investigated the potential of waste plastic oil (WPO) synthesized by pyrolysis of waste plastics as an alternative to diesel fuel. The performance and emission characteristics of WPO in a single-cylinder diesel engine were studied. In addition to pure plastic oil, three co-blends (PO25, PO50, and PO75) were prepared to enable the engine to run on pure plastic oil. Compared to pure plastic oil, the blends significantly reduced emissions, with PO25 emitting 22% less smoke and being the best-emitting fuel of all the tested fuels. This project provides a viable idea for converting waste plastics into alternative energy sources.
Overall, the conversion of waste plastics into H2 and fuel products offers significant advantages over traditional recycling methods. On the economic side, recycled waste plastics can be used to produce fuels and other types of chemicals, helping to reduce overall system production costs and improve resource utilization due to the low-cost nature of waste plastics. In addition, conversion products such as H2 and liquid oil display high economic and environmental benefits; the conversion of waste plastics into energy carriers could reduce waste emissions and environmental pollution. For example, catalytic cracking of waste plastics can obtain higher product selectivity and reduce unnecessary by-products. In addition, when H2 is used as a fuel, the combustion product is only one substance, water, which has great environmental benefits. In terms of energy benefits, waste plastics can be converted into high quality fuels and some research has shown that the calorific value of the fuel produced by pyrolysis of waste plastics is comparable to or even higher than that of diesel fuel. The H2 produced can increase the supply of clean energy and reduce dependence on fossil energy.
Conventional thermal treatment of fuels from the conversion of waste plastics gives a high calorific value and a superior performance close to that of diesel. However, the conversion process requires high temperatures and long reaction times, making it an energy-intensive conversion method. Current methods of converting plastics to fuel by pyrolysis require a high energy input, resulting in huge losses of around 50%, which means a large number of feedstock changes are required to keep the system running.179 In addition, conventional pyrolysis conversion has a number of disadvantages, such as the low octane and wide carbon number distribution of the resulting liquid oil that causes more pollution when burned;180,181 the formation of olefins and paraffin during the conversion process, which might lead to clogged pipes; and, worse still, the generation of volatile compounds and harmful gases, which can lead to environmental pollution.122 It is worth noting that some new conversion methods (Table 7), such as thermal treatment technologies and new oxidation methods, are now addressing some of these issues and producing higher quality fuels. Due to the high selectivity of a catalyst, the yield of unwanted by-products is reduced, making the overall recovery system relatively more environmentally friendly and efficient.182–184 However, high energy consumption is still a problem and ample attention should be paid to this issue.

4. Conversion of waste plastics into phase change thermal energy storage materials
4.1 Converting waste plastics into phase change thermal energy storage materials by physical means
The conversion of waste plastics into phase change materials (PCMs) is one way of using them in the field of thermal energy storage. PCMs can absorb heat at a constant temperature and convert it to latent heat through variations in physical state.190–192 PCMs have a low cost and a wide variety of applications.193–195 According to their phase change morphologies, they can be divided into solid–liquid, solid–solid, and liquid–gas PCMs. Solid–liquid PCMs are high-quality energy storage materials because of their advantages of having a significant latent heat of phase shift and a minimal volume change during the phase change.196–198 Yet, low thermal conductivity and leakage problems in the energy storage process are problems for solid–liquid PCMs; therefore, resolving these issues will effectively encourage the widespread use of PCMs in the field of energy storage.199–201
Zhang et al.202 packed paraffin wax (PW), a phase change material (PCM), with porous carbon manufactured from waste plastic (Fig. 18a–d). Scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared analysis, and X-ray diffraction analysis were used to investigate the chemical composition and microstructure of the PCM. The best calcination temperature for PW encapsulation effectiveness is 450 °C. The material manufactured at this temperature has the highest energy density, lowest leakage rate, and best shape setting. The obtained PCMs show a thermal conductivity of 0.55 W (m K)−1 which is roughly three times that of the original paraffin. Thermal gravimetric stability analysis research reveals that the PCM has a noticeable strengthening impact as a result of the shielding and stabilizing action of waste plastic composite. However, the enthalpy of phase change decreased significantly, to only 49.2 J g−1. Zhu et al.203 used coal-derived three-dimensional graphitic porous carbon as a carbon source to wrap PW and obtained a composite PCM with an enthalpy of 187.4 J g−1.
Shao et al.204 used PW as a core material to construct microencapsulated PCMs by a phase separation method. Phase change granular materials have a continuous surface and a regular spherical structure. Compared with other PCMs, the latent heat of this PCM significantly increased to 72.5 J g−1. The above method produces no pollutants and increases the latent heat of the PCMs, which we consider to be environmentally friendly. Sun et al.205 used PP in a graded, controlled degrading process to generate a self-nucleating, shape-gradient composite PCM with high thermal conductivity. The average phase change point of the material was 61 °C, the average enthalpy value of phase change reached 216 kJ kg−1, and the average thermal conductivity was 2.9 W (m K)−1.
Waste plastics have some restrictions on their use as PCMs due to their undesirable thermophysical characteristics. We can offset this disadvantage by combining waste plastics with materials with excellent thermophysical properties. Chavan et al.206 addressed these shortcomings by combining discarded HDPE with thermophysically superior additions such as functional graphene.
Numerical values and experimental analyses were used to analyze the thermal properties of the energy storage materials LLDPE, CPCM-1, CPCM-2, and CPCM-3. Due to the addition of the optimum concentrations of reinforcement elements, CPCM-2 demonstrated a substantially superior storage capacity (performance enhanced by 54%). The solidification process was carried out by convection and radiative heat transfer and the energy content of the four materials was only slightly reduced during the solidification process, indicating that waste plastics can be converted into efficient heat storage materials (Fig. 17).

4.2 Converting waste plastics into phase change thermal energy storage materials by chemical means
Modification of plastic encapsulated PCMs by introducing chemical bonding offers a new idea for the application of waste plastics in phase change energy storage. Yuan et al.208,209 for the first time introduced the oxime carbamate bond into chemically crosslinked polyurethane to manufacture recyclable solid–solid PCMs and merged colorless chemical crosslinking and recyclability into a single solid–solid PCM. The finely dispersed polyethylene glycol (PEG) segment serves as a polymer framework as well as a phase change component. The solid–solid PCMs produced have a high energy storage capacity (enthalpy up to 101 J g−1) and high thermal stability (Fig. 19). The solid–solid PCMs can be recovered and reprocessed by simple hot pressing due to the reversibility of the oxime carbamate bond. The dynamically crosslinked PCM was effectively made by mixing complementary PE containing carboxylic acid and tertiary amine via an acid–base reaction with a reversible ionic bond. The produced PCM has good crystallinity and can store/release latent heat reversibly during heating and cooling. Physical crosslinking in the PCM can maintain form stability while having no effect on the latent heat value. Within the temperature range of 13.2–45.4 °C, a high latent heat of 70 J g−1 can be obtained. This good heat storage ability remains intact after 100 consecutive heating and cooling cycles. The initial decomposition temperature is higher than 250 °C.
 Fig. 19  Tests of energy storage performance of polyurethane PCMs:209 (a) DSC curves of PU-CH before and after 100 cycles, (b) DSC curves of PU-NH before and after 100 cycles, (c) DSC curves of PU-CH-NH before and after 100 cycles. 
Fu et al.210 created a solid–solid PCM network (PCMN) in the presence of a transesterification catalyst by esterifying polycarboxylate PEG produced from hot glutaric anhydride with trimethyl propane triacetate (1-promazine). The PCMN features recyclability, high latent heat, and network self-stability. As the encapsulated content increases from 87.9% to 93.5%, the latent heat of PCMN increases from 93.5 J g−1 to 137.3 J g−1. Guo et al.211 used stearic acid (SA) as the PCM, waste PAN fiber as a skeleton material, and N,N-dimethylformamide as a solvent to prepare the stable PAN/SA blend PCM by solution blending method. The microstructure and heat storage properties of PAN and SA were characterized and studied by experimental instruments. The results showed that PAN and SA were encapsulated through intermolecular force and SA was uniformly distributed in the PAN matrix. The obtained materials have excellent thermal storage properties and are environmentally friendly, as no waste gas is generated in the reaction process. Lu et al.212 used radiation crosslinking to create new shape-stable PCMs for thermal energy storage applications, using bio-based polyester lactic acid (PLA) as the support matrix and waste HDPE as the phase change working material. The experimental results show that the PLA50/50HDPE blend has good shape stability and heat storage capacity. The co-continuous structure of the unmelted PLA component in the blend can support the HDPE component and maintain its shape during phase transformation. The latent heats of the blend during melting and solidification are 100.1 J g−1 and 97.6 J g−1, respectively, and the relative enthalpy efficiency is 104.2%. After 10 thermal cycles, the thermal parameters of the PLA50/50HDPE blend remained almost unchanged. Yang et al.213 used PEG or PW as a heat storage material and PP or PE as a support material to study the preparation of morphologically stable phase change heat storage materials. The microstructure of the components was observed by an optical microscope and the melting temperature and latent heat of the components were determined by differential scanning calorimetry.
The instability of common organic PCMs in the molten state limits their future applications. Fredi et al.214 developed electrospun fiber felt made of polyethylene oxide (PEO), a PCM with outstanding thermal property and biocompatibility, and increased its shape instability in the molten state via ultraviolet (UV) light cross-linking. In addition to enhanced resistance to water-based solvents, UV-cured electrospun PEO pads displayed considerable latent heat (112 J g−1) that was maintained for more than 80 heating and cooling cycles at the whole phase change temperature. Photo-crosslinked electrospun PEO materials have high thermal properties, good shape stability, and no leakage.
Although there have been studies on the application of waste plastics in the field of energy storage, the existing preparation methods are often limited, by more complex preparation processes or harsh preparation conditions, to the preparation of laboratory doses. The purpose of current research is to find a simpler way to prepare PCMs. Liu et al.207,215,216 adopted the shape stabilization method to use waste PS foam as the holding material for thermal energy storage and achieved an in situ PCM packaging protocol. The Lewis acid catalyst used in this process can be converted into the corresponding metal oxide using a simple alkali treatment, which not only reduces the time-consuming steps of metal species separation but also improves external thermal conductivity. Compared to the original paraffin, the thermal conductivity of the PCM can be increased by up to 3.7 W (m K)−1, a maximum improvement of 61.0% (Fig. 18e–f and 20), and it has the advantages of being green and sustainable, providing a method for the green recycling of waste plastics. Karkri et al.217 used in situ polymerization to create a microcapsule with a paraffin core with a melting point of about 42 °C and a melamine–formaldehyde resin shell. The distribution of capsules in the HDPE matrix is uniform and there is no tendency to agglomerate. The microencapsulated fossil wax acts as a high-latent heat material. The thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity of these PCMs are measured using the periodic temperature method and the latent heat is measured using a protective hot plate device. The results show that the 60% weight of microcapsules gives 91307 kJ kg−1 of effective thermal energy storage value. Kong et al.218 prepared thermosetting polyurethane based on PEG and polyaryl polymethylene isocyanate by solvent-free bulk polymerization. The cross-linking structure does not affect the crystal structure of the manufactured PCM, which has a high latent heat and an appropriate phase change temperature and can be employed for energy storage. The maximum latent heats of the PCMs in the melting and freezing processes reach 111.7 J g−1 and 110.4 J g−1, respectively. The prepared PCMs have good thermal reliability and stability, high atomic economy and a non-polluting reaction process with excellent environmental friendliness.

The above research shows that the main methods of transforming waste plastics into PCMs by physical means are high temperature calcination into a porous carbon source, dissolution, melt mixing, etc. The transformation of waste plastics into porous carbon-sourced encapsulated PCMs reduces the latent heat of the composite PCMs, which tends to increase as the content of the encapsulated PCMs increases. The method of dissolution and melt blending increases the latent heat of the PCMs and produces no contaminants, which we consider to be a relatively eco-friendly method. The transformation of waste plastics into PCMs through chemical methods is mainly through cross-linking reactions to modify the plastics and then polymerise the PCMs and introduce different chemical bonds. Compared with physical blending methods, the cross-linking process displayed improved latent heat of the PCMs and emitted no pollutants, so is considered to be an environmentally friendly method (Table 9).

5. Summary and prospect
Owing to the urgency of the energy and environmental crises, researchers are paying ample attention to the recycling of waste plastics. The aim of this paper is to shed light on the energy storage prospects of the high value-added use of waste plastics and thus provide new inspiration for recycling them. From this summary of recent advances in the field, some suggestions and future advances are listed as follows:
(1) Waste plastics are mainly composed of carbon atoms and converting them into carbon materials seems to be a rational method. As traditional carbonization not only consumes huge amounts of energy but also causes secondary pollution, a reasonable way to make waste plastic into carbon materials more economically with fewer emissions requires additional input and development.
(2) Hydrogen-rich gas is frequently produced instead of hydrogen. It is difficult to separate the output gases in the case of conversion of waste plastics into hydrogen and conversion efficiencies vary, so research into efficient catalysts and the design of reaction factors is critical to improving the comprehensive conversion efficiency.
(3) When waste plastics are transformed into fuel, only a limited range of plastic materials are utilized and there are issues with efficiency and secondary pollutants throughout the conversion process.
(4) The fuel generated by conversion is often used as alternative energy, but there are problems with its quality. For example, when transformed fuel is used as a backup fuel for diesel generators, the performance is still far from that of the original diesel. Further research is needed to improve the quality of the output fuel.
(5) All methods of recycling and converting waste plastics aim at one or more types of plastics, so it is clear that classifying waste plastics for their specific utilization is crucial for rational recycling. This requires support from relevant government policies and waste classification awareness from citizens.
