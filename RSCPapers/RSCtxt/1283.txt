    , Accepted 27th March 2020First published on 30th March 2020AbstractTwo BODIPY derivatives with one (B2) and two (B3) carbazole moieties were synthesized and applied as electron-donor materials in organic photovoltaic cells (OPV). Their optical and electrochemical properties were systematically investigated. These BODIPY dyes exhibit excellent solubility in organic solvents and present high molar extinction coefficients (1.37–1.48 × 105 M−1 cm−1) in solutions with absorption maxima at 586 nm for mono-styryl groups and at 672 nm for di-styryl groups. The introduction of the styryl moieties results in a large bathochromic shift and a significant decrease in the HOMO–LUMO energy-gaps. The BODIPY dyes show relatively low HOMO energies ranging from −4.99 to −5.16 eV as determined from cyclic voltammetry measurements. Cyclic voltammetry measurements and theoretical calculations demonstrate that the frontier molecular orbital levels of these compounds match with those of PC71BM as the acceptor, supporting their application as donor materials in solution-processed small molecule bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells. After the optimization of the active layer, B2:PC71BM and B3:PC71BM based organic solar cells showed an overall power conversion efficiency of 6.41% and 7.47%, respectively. The higher PCE of the B3-based OSC is ascribed to the more balanced charge transport and exciton dissociation, better crystallinity and molecular packing.
1. Introduction
Solar cells have attracted considerable attention as renewable and environmentally friendly energy sources due to environmental issues and the increasing energy crisis resulting from the exhaustion of petroleum resources.1,2 During the development of solar energy conversion technology, silicon solar cells are the commercially predominant photovoltaic technology.3 However, Organic Solar Cells (OSCs), based on a bulk heterojunction (BHJ) structure typically consisting of a blend of a photoactive polymer or a small molecule as an electron donor and a fullerene derivative as an electron acceptor, are a promising technology to convert solar energy into electricity. They have shown to be relevant candidates for next-generation renewable energy convertors owing to some unique merits such as transparency, low cost, flexibility, copious availability, large area, uncomplicated fabrication, and light weight.4–9 Over the past decades, both Small-Molecule based OSCs (SM-OSCs) and polymer-based organic solar cells have shown good performance in bulk hetero-junction organic solar cell devices.10–12 Recently, the polymer-based OSCs as donors have made significant progress with an outstanding efficiency of more than 13%, which represents great progress for future successful commercialization of OSCs.13–16 Although the polymer solar cells are very promising for the development of solar energy conversion devices, the drawbacks of polymer OSCs such as chain-length polydispersity, low batch-to-batch reproducibility, structural defects, and possible difficulties in purification still remarkably limit their application on the industrial scale.3,9,17 On the other hand, compared to organic polymers, small organic molecules are preferred to be utilized as photoactive electron donors due to their potential advantages such as facile purification and characterization, definite molecular structure and molecular weight, high purity and good batch-to-batch reproducibility.9,17–19 In addition, the absorption spectra and orbital energy levels of small organic molecules can be fine-tuned with suitable structural modifications so as to match the device characteristics to a specific given acceptor, which is very difficult in polymer solar cells.9 Recently, great efforts have been made to raise the Power Conversion Efficiencies (PCEs) of small organic molecule OSCs.20–22 To date, OSCs based on a small molecule as a donor have reached efficiencies in the range of 10–12%,11,21 which has made them closer to commercial viability.23–25 However, new ideal small molecule materials are still in great need to further improve the PCEs and device durability, which are crucial for the commercialization of this technology.26 Therefore, it is worthwhile to investigate new small organic molecules for application in bulk heterojunction solar cells.
Based on the distinguishing properties of BODIPY and carbazole, in order to develop a promising BODIPY based small molecule for a high efficiency OSC, we have designed and synthesized two carbazole–BODIPY based dyes (B2 and B3, Scheme 1) by Knoevenagel condensation reaction. The optical properties, electrochemical behavior and photovoltaic performances of these styryl substituted BODIPY dyes were investigated and the influence of the donor's electron donating ability and substituted positions on their electronic and photovoltaic properties was also comparatively investigated.

Employing PC71BM as the acceptor and these two BODIPY based small molecules as the donors, the OSCs based on B2:PC71BM and B3:PC71BM BHJ active layers showed an overall PCE of 6.41% (Jsc = 13.48 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.78 V and FF = 0.61) and 7.47% (Jsc = 16.18 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.71 and FF = 0.65), respectively.
2. Experimental section
2.1. General
All chemicals and solvents were of analytical reagent grade and used directly as received unless otherwise noted. Dry CH2Cl2 was distilled from CaH2 under nitrogen. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were collected on a Bruker DRX-600 AVANCE III spectrometer. Chemical shifts for 1H NMR spectra were recorded in ppm relative to CDCl3 (δ = 7.26 ppm) as the internal standard. Mass spectral data were obtained using a Thermo Fisher LTQ Orbitrap XL (HR-ESI) spectrometer.
2.2. Synthesis

B1 (Scheme 2) was synthesized according to the reported literature27 and C1 was synthesized according to the reported literature.28

2.3. Electrochemistry
CH2Cl2 was dried over alumina cartridges using a solvent purification system PureSolv PS-MD-5 model from Innovative Technology and kept under argon. Tetraethylammonium tetrafluoroborate (TEABF4) was purchased from Alfa Aesar and recrystallized in MeOH. Electrochemical measurements were performed in CH2Cl2 under an Ar atmosphere in a three-electrode glass cell. The working electrode (WE) was a platinum (Pt) disk (Ø = 1 mm, a surface area of about 0.785 mm2). A Pt wire was used as the counter electrode (CE). Saturated aqueous calomel (SCE) was used as the reference electrode (RE). The RE was separated from the WE compartment by a double frit comprising an intermediate background solution (0.1 M TEABF4 + CH2Cl2). Under these conditions, when operating in CH2Cl2 (0.1 M TEABF4), the formal potential for the Fc+/Fc couple was found to be +0.52 V vs. SCE. All electrochemical studies were performed using an Autolab PGSTAT 302N potentiostat. Cyclic voltammetry experiments were performed at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1.
2.4. Synthesis

Synthesis of compounds B2 and B3. 
In a 50 ml three-neck round bottom flask with Dean–Stark apparatus, B1 (3 mmol, 1098 mg), C1 (3 mmol, 754 mg), p-toluenesulfonic acid (0.87 mmol, 150 mg), toluene (25 ml) and piperidine (2 ml) were added. After heating to reflux, the progress of the reaction was monitored by TLC, the reaction was stopped until B1 disappeared completely. The mixture was cooled to room temperature, washed twice with brine, and extracted three times with dichloromethane. The combined organic phase was dried over anhydrous Na2SO4 and the solvent was evaporated using a rotary evaporator under reduced pressure. The resulting crude residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography, eluted with CH2Cl2/petroleum ether = 6:4, giving B2 (214.7 mg, 12%) and B3 (318.2 mg, 13%).

2.5. Device fabrication and characterization
Solution processed organic solar cells were fabricated on an ITO coated glass substrate. The ITO coated glass substrate was cleaned with a detergent and subsequently ultra-sonicated in deionized water, acetone and isopropyl alcohol and dried in a vacuum oven to remove all the traces of residues. For each molecule, the photovoltaic performance optimization process was started by identifying the donor to acceptor ratio (weight percentage, varying from 1:0.5 to 1:2) and after that solvent vapor annealing was applied to maximize the performance of the OSCs. PC71BM was used as the acceptor and the total concentration of the D:A blend mixture was 16 mg mL−1 in chloroform. The devices were fabricated by depositing PEDOT:PSS as a hole transport layer having a thickness of 35–40 nm. The active layer was deposited by spin coating (2500 rpm, 60 s) on the top of the PEDOT:PSS layer under ambient conditions. For solvent vapor annealing (SVA), the optimized OSCs (as cast 1:1.5 D/A wt ratio) were exposed to the THF vapor for 40s. A thin layer of PFN was spin coated on the top of the active layer from the methanol solution. The aluminum (Al) electrode was deposited on the top of the PFN layer via thermal evaporation at a pressure less than 10−5 Torr. The current–voltage characteristics of the OSCs were measured at an illumination intensity of 100 mW cm−2 (AM1.5 G) using a solar simulator and a Keithley 2400 source meter unit. The incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurements were performed using a Bentham IPCE system.
2.6. Computational details
Quantum mechanics calculations were performed with the Gaussian16 software package.29 Energy and forces were computed by density functional theory with the M06-2X exchange–correlation functional,30 with the Pople 6-31G(d,p) basis sets. Geometry optimizations were conducted with the default criteria. Frequency calculations were performed to confirm that all structures were minimized.
2.7 Spectroscopic measurements
UV-vis spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-3100 spectrophotometer. All spectra and PLQYs were recorded on a fluoro Log-Ultra-Fast (HORIBA Instrument Inc, Edison) equipped with a 450 W CW xenon lamp and an Open-Electrode TECooled CCD Detector (Syncerity). Absorption and emission measurements were carried out in 1 × 1 cm quartz cuvettes with spectroscopic grade solvent, and the temperature was kept constant at (298 ± 2) K. An integrating sphere was mounted in the sample compartment directly for PLQY measurement. Nanosecond lifetime and TRES studies were conducted using a TCSPC MCA model equipped with a picosecond photodetector (<200 ps) (PPD850) and picosecond laser (duration is 180 ps, Deltadiode, 100 MHz laser). The TRES data were measured by incrementing the monochromator on the emission channel of the time-resolved fluorometer in fixed wavelength intervals at each wavelength. Slices of data were taken in the intensity-wavelength plane to obtain the spectra at different times during the decay. Microsecond lifetime decays were collected in the MCS mode on a TCSPC HUB (Delta HUB) equipped with an LED source (Spectra LED) as a sample excitation source.
3. Results and discussion
Among the various types of small molecule photovoltaic materials, 4,4-difluoro-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene (BODIPY) dyes have attracted tremendous interest and have been considered to be excellent photoelectric materials owing to their outstanding photophysical properties, such as high molar extinction coefficients, high fluorescence quantum yields, excellent chemical stability, various redox activities, relatively long excited state lifetimes, and high thermal and photostabilities,31–33 which have led to their application in many fields including bioimaging,34,35 nonlinear optics,36,37 photodynamic therapy,38 organic light-emitting diodes,39,40 dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs)2,41,42 and OSCs.1 In addition, BODIPY derivatives are easily synthesized, and their photophysical and electrochemical characteristics can be easily fine-tuned through an appropriate synthetic modification of the BODIPY core.43–46 For example, the absorption wavelength of the BODIPY dyes can be finely adjusted by introducing different functional groups at the α, β or meso-positions.27,47 Moreover, BODIPY dyes can also exhibit variable redox chemistry by selectively accessing a group having a corresponding function, and they have been used as both electron donors and acceptors.48–50 Considering these outstanding advantages, BODIPY dyes can serve as potent candidates for bulk heterojunction solar cells.1,7 In 2009, Roncali et al. first reported the use of BODIPY dyes as donor materials and [6,6]-phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) as an electron acceptor in BHJ-OSCs with a PCE of 1.34%.51 Since then, continuous progress has been made on BODIPY dyes by using them as donors in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells.7,17,52–62 In 2016, Liao et al. synthesized and characterized a series of novel BODIPY derivatives with various electron donors at 2,6-positions for BHJ-OSCs, and the best device exhibits 2.15% PCE.63 In 2017, Singh et al. reported a novel boron dipyrromethene based dye decorated with dithiafulvalene wings and its bulk heterojunction solar cells with PC71BM have achieved a PCE of 7.2%.61 In 2018, Li et al. reported three furan-fused BODIPYs with increasing perfluorinated alkyl chains on the meso-C of the BODIPY core, and an encouraging PCE of 6.4%, with a high FF of 64%, was achieved with C60 as the electron acceptor.62 Recently, Gros et al. have designed and synthesized two novel small molecules consisting of a BODIPY central core surrounded by two DiketoPyrroloPyrroles (DPPs) and two porphyrin units.3 The resulting molecule BD-tPor presented an impressive PCE of 8.98% when blended with PC71BM as an acceptor for solution processed bulk heterojunction organic solar cells.3 More recently, Sobral et al. have designed three novel BODIPY-based molecules with different styryl aromatic donor groups and constructed OSCs with PC60BM, which showed a PCE of 2.8%.64 Very recently, Singh et al. have reported two efficient donor materials composed of the dithienosilole/dithienogermole core linked thienyl BODIPY, and the best PCE of 4.58% was achieved.9 These encouraging results suggest that the BODIPY derivatives have emerged as promising photovoltaic materials. On the other hand, carbazole derivatives have attracted considerable attention in the field of optoelectronics owing to their low redox potential, superior hole transport properties, coplanar configuration, and strong electron donating ability.58 The introduction of a carbazole donating unit in D–A organic semiconductors, lowering the HOMO energy level, results in a high open circuit voltage in OSCs.65,66 In addition, the introduction of carbazole groups into the BODIPY unit can not only improve the photoelectric properties but also result in the remarkably red shifted absorption spectra and better hole transport.67 Zhang et al. designed star shaped carbazole–BODIPY derivatives and employed them as donors in BHJ organic solar cells and reported a moderate PCE of 2.70% with a high Voc of 0.85 V.68 In 2015, Sharma et al. used three carbazole substituted BODIPY small molecules as donors along with PC71BM as an electron acceptor to construct solution processed BHJ organic solar cells, which achieved a PCE at 5.08%.58
3.1. Synthesis
BODIPY B1 was synthesized according to the literature.27 Compounds B2 and B3 were prepared by a Knoevenagel condensation reaction between B1 and p-methoxybenzaldehyde in the presence of 4-methylbenzenesulfonic acid (PTSA) and piperidine in toluene (Scheme 2). The structures of the synthesized compounds were further confirmed by 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectroscopy and HRMS (ESI).
3.2. Electrochemistry
The cyclic voltammetry curves and differential pulse voltammetry data for B2 and B3 are presented in Fig. 1 and 2, respectively. Electrochemical data from Table 1 were used to assess the frontier orbital energy levels (Table 2). The HOMO and LUMO energy levels were estimated by using the following equations: HOMO = −(4.8 + E1/2(Ox1)) and LUMO = −(4.8 + E1/2(Red1)), according to Cardona et al.69 and Wang et al.70B1 has already been studied under similar conditions as described for B2 and B371 and its measured HOMO–LUMO gap was 2.33 eV. Among B2 and B3 derivatives, B2 exhibits the highest HOMO–LUMO band gap (1.99 eV, Table 1) due to a lower extension of the π-system (see Fig. 5). However, this value is lower than the one found for B1 proving the significant π-conjugation between the additional carbazole moiety and the BODIPY moiety. When the BODIPY is connected to two carbazole units (B3), the HOMO–LUMO gap dropped to 1.72 eV.

The better LUMO and HOMO offsets between donors (B2 and B3) and PC71BM (higher than the threshold value of ∼0.3 eV) are beneficial for the efficient photo-induced charge transfer at D/A interfaces and transport in the BHJ active layers.72
3.3. Optical properties
The photophysical properties of the BODIPY compounds B2 and B3 were measured in CH2Cl2. The normalized absorption and fluorescence spectra of compounds B2 and B3 are shown in Fig. 3 and 4, respectively. Their photophysical data are summarized in Table 3. The two BODIPY dyes exhibit the classic absorption and emission spectra of BODIPY fluorophores.73,74 Compound B2 shows the maximum absorption with a sharp S0–S1 (π–π*) transition at 586 nm. Upon the introduction of the second carbazolyl vinyl group, the main absorption peak of B3 (672 nm) shows a bathochromic shift of 86 nm by comparison with B2 due to the extension of π-conjugation. This is illustrated in Fig. 5 in which the HOMO and LUMO densities are shown: in B3 the HOMO is spread on both arms. As the LUMO is mostly localized on the BODIPY moiety, the π-conjugation extension leads to a reduced optical gap for B3 compared to B2. Interestingly, the difference between the optical HOMO–LUMO in B2 and B3 is close to the one measured by electrochemistry which amounted to 97 nm. In addition, there is a broad but weak absorption in the UV region ascribed to the S0–Sn (n ≥ 2) transitions of the BODIPY moiety for compounds B2 and B3.75 In summary, B2 and B3 can absorb longer wavelength light, which suggest their use in light-harvesting systems.

The emission spectra of the two compounds were also recorded in CH2Cl2 solutions (Fig. 4) and show a perfect mirror symmetry with the absorption spectra with Stokes shift in the range of 20–39 nm. The fluorescence emission maxima for compounds B2 and B3 are centered at 616 nm and 701 nm, respectively. The fluorescence quantum yields were also determined in CH2Cl2 (Table 3). The fluorescence quantum yields of B2 and B3 are 0.86 and 0.42, respectively. In addition, the fluorescence lifetimes (τ) of these two BODIPY dyes were also measured, which show a single exponential decay with a lifetime of approximately 4 ns (Table 3).
The optical absorption spectra of the B2 and B3 films are shown in Fig. 3b. As compared to solution, the ICT band of thin film absorption is significantly red-shifted and also broadened, which may be attributed to the strong aggregation and molecular interaction in the solid state. The optical bandgap estimated from the onset absorption edge of the thin film absorption is about 1.78 eV and 1.58 eV for B2 and B3, respectively. The small optical bandgap for B3 may be ascribed to its longer conjugation length as compared to B2 due to the additional carbazole donor unit.
3.4. Photovoltaic properties
BHJ OSCs with the configuration glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/PFN/Al were fabricated using B2 and B3 as the electron donor materials along with PC71BM as the electron acceptor material. The relative content of the donor and acceptor in the active layer for OSCs is crucial for obtaining a mixed BHJ morphology, for efficient exciton harvesting and for the formation of sufficient charge transport network.20,78 Initially, the photovoltaic performances of B2 and B3 were evaluated carefully via the variation of donor to acceptor weight ratios with a total concentration of 16 mg mL−1 using chloroform as solvent. We found that the device with a 1:1.5 weight ratio showed the best Power Conversion Efficiency (PCE) of about 3.21% and 3.59% for B2:PC71BM and B3:PC71BM active layers, respectively (Table 4). In order to further improve the PCE of the OSCs, we have adopted solvent vapor annealing (SVA) of the active layer having a D:A ratio of 1:1.5 with THF for 40 s and found that the PCE has been improved significantly. This is attributed to the improvement in the nanoscale morphology of the active layers.79–81 The current–voltage characteristics of the OSCs based on optimized active layers are shown in Fig. 6a and the photovoltaic parameters are compiled in Table 4. The OSCs based on the B2:PC71BM and B3:PC71BM active layers after SVA treatment showed an overall PCE of 6.41% (Jsc = 13.16 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.78 and FF = 0.61) and 7.45% (Jsc = 16.18 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.71 V and FF = 0.65), respectively. Upon THF treatment, the Jsc and FF of the OSCs increase dramatically, and this may be attributed to the improvement in the nanoscale morphology of the active layer. However, Voc is reduced after SVA treatment which may be due to morphological changes at the contact interfaces and reduction in the quasi Fermi level gaps.21

The Voc value for the OSCs based on B2 is higher than that for B3 and this may be attributed to the deeper HOMO energy level of B2, since Voc is directly proportional to the energy offset between the HOMO of the donor and LUMO of the acceptor employed in the BHJ active layer of the OSCs. Since the HOMO and LUMO energy levels are about −6.05 eV and 4.10 eV, the ΔEHOMO (D)–LUMO (A) offset for B2:PC71BM and B3:PC71BM is equal to 1.065 eV and 0.89 eV, respectively, which is consistent with the trend in the values of Voc for the OSCs. The value of Jsc is higher for B3 than that for B2, and this may be related to the broader and lower bandgap of B3 as compared to that of B2, leading to the improved light harvesting capability of the B3:PC71BM active layer as compared to that of B2:PC71BM. Moreover, the FF value for the B3 based OSCs is also higher than that for the B2 counterparts, which may have originated from the more balanced charge transport as discussed in the later part of the manuscript.
In order to get information about the higher value of Jsc for the B3 based OSCs as compared to the B2 counterparts, we have recorded the incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the OSCs which are shown in Fig. 6b. The IPCE spectra show two bands i.e. one in the wavelength region of 300–500 nm, which corresponds to the photocurrent generation due to PC71BM, and the other beyond 500 nm corresponding to the photocurrent generation due to the donor (B2 or B3), indicating that both the donor and acceptor components in the BHJ active layer contribute to the photocurrent generation. As can be seen from the spectra, the IPCE spectrum of the B2 based OSC is limited up to 650 nm, whereas it is extended up to 790 nm for the B3 counterpart. The estimated values of Jsc from the IPCE spectra are about 13.39 mA cm−2 and 16.12 mA cm−2 for the B2 and B3 based OSCs and are consistent with the values observed for the J–V characteristics of the devices under illumination.
Charge transport in the active layers plays an important role in achieving high values of FF and Jsc, and therefore, we have measured the hole and electron mobilities in the active layers using the hole only (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Au) and electron only (ITO/Al/active layer/Al) devices, respectively. The hole and electron mobility values computed from the space charge limited current (SCLC) model are shown in Fig. 7a and b for hole only and electron only devices, respectively. The hole mobility was found to be about 8.89 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.07 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for B2 and B3, respectively, for optimized active layers. The electron mobility in the active layers is almost the same at about 2.41 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 2.47 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, leading to an electron to hole mobility ratio of about 3.65 and 2.59, for the active layers based on B2 and B3, respectively. The reduction of the electron to hole mobility ratio for the B2 based device contributes to the enhancement in the charge transport within the active layer, hence leading to the higher values of Jsc and FF.

In order to get information about the difference in the charge generation, recombination and extraction processes, in the OSCs based on B2 and B3, the variation of photocurrent density (Jph) with effective voltage (Veff) was analyzed and is shown in Fig. 8. Jph is described as Jph = JL − Jd, where JL and JD are the current densities under illumination and in the dark, respectively. Veff is defined as Veff = Vo − Va, where Vo is the voltage at which Jph is zero and Va is the applied voltage. As can be seen from this figure, in both devices, Jph increases linearly with Veff at low voltages and tends to saturate at Veff = 0.92 V and 0.64 V for B2 and B3, respectively, and completely saturates to the saturation photocurrent (Jphsat) at a high value of Veff, indicating that all photogenerated excitons are dissociated into free charge carriers and efficiently collected by the electrodes. The exciton dissociation efficiency (Pdiss) and charge collection efficiency (Pcoll) were estimated as Jph/Jphsat under short circuit and maximum power point conditions, respectively.82,83 The values of Pdiss/Pcoll for the devices based on B2 and B3 are about 0.907/0.642 and 0.948/0.723, respectively. These observations confirm that exciton dissociation and collection is more efficient for the B3 based OSCs than that for B2 which may be the reason for the high values of Jsc and FF for the B3 based OSCs. Generally, at a high value of Veff, all photogenerated excitons are dissociated into free charge carriers and Jphsat mainly depends on the exciton generation rate (Gmax) which is described as Jphsat = qLGmax, where q is the electronic charge and L is the thickness of the active layer. The values of Gmax of the optimized OSCs are about 1.03 × 1028 m−3 s−1 and 1.12 × 1028 m−3 s−1 for B2 and B3, respectively. The higher value of Gmax for the B3 based OSC as compared to its B2 counterpart indicates that more excitons are generated in the B3:PC71BM active layer (particularly in B3) due to the broader absorption spectra of B3.

In order to get more information about the difference in the recombination processes in the OSCs based on B2 and B3, we have measured the variation of Jsc with illumination intensity (Pin)84–86 as shown in Fig. 9a, which is described as Jsc ∝ (Pin)α, where α is the exponent that describes the degree of recombination. The bimolecular recombination is negligible when the value of α is unity, whereas when α is less than unity there is a competition between the bimolecular recombination and charge recombination. The values of α for the devices based on B2 and B3 are about 0.91 and 0.94, respectively, indicating that the bimolecular recombination is less for the B3 based devices, leading to a high value of FF.
 Fig. 9  Variation of (a) Jsc and (b) Voc with illumination intensity(Pin) for the OSCs based on optimized B2 and B3 active layers. 
The variation of Voc with Pin for the OSCs is shown in Fig. 9b. Voc is proportional to S [ln(Pin)], where S is the slope extracted from the linear fit of Voc with ln(Pin). When S is equal to 1 kT/q, the bimolecular recombination is the dominant mechanism whereas a larger value of S than 1 kT/q indicates that the trap-assisted recombination or germinating recombination may be dominating in the devices. The values of S estimated from Fig. 9b are 1.56 kT/q and 1.38 kT/q for B2 and B3 based devices, indicating that the trap-assisted recombination is less for the B3 based OSCs. Therefore, the higher values of Jsc and FF for the B3 based OSCs can be due to the high exciton dissociation, weak bimolecular recombination and trap-assisted recombination, which are related to the crystalline molecular packing nature of the active layer.
In order to get information about the crystallinity and the molecular ordering of the optimized active layers based on B2:PC71BM and B3:PC71BM as well as for the pristine B2 and B3, X-ray diffraction measurements were performed and are shown in Fig. 10 for optimized blends and in Fig. S9 (ESI†) for pristine films. The pristine B2 and B3 films show the same strong (100) diffraction peaks at 2θ = 5.24° and different (010) diffraction peaks at 2θ = 22.98° and 23.30°, for B2 and B3, respectively. When blended with PC71BM, both the active layers show a strong (100) diffraction peak at 2θ = 5.06°, which corresponds to a lamellar distance of 1.88 nm. However, the (010) diffraction peaks for B2:PC71BM and B3:PC71BM are observed at 2θ = 22.74° and 23.08°, respectively, corresponding to the π–π stacking distances of 0.408 nm and 0.389 nm, respectively. In addition to these peaks, a weak diffraction peak at around 2θ = 18° is also observed in both the thin films, which corresponds to PC71BM.87 Moreover, both the diffraction peaks are stronger for the B3 based thin film as compared to B2 indicating that the degree of crystallinity is better for the former than the latter. The enhanced crystalline nature and reduced π–π stacking distance for the B3:PC71BM active layer may induce better nanoscale phase separation and may be beneficial for charge transport and collection. These observations may be the reason for the higher FF and greater PCE of the OSCs based on the B3:PC71BM active layer.

We have also investigated the morphology of the optimized B2:PC71BM and B3:PC71B active layers by recording the Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) images as shown in Fig. 11. It can be seen from these images that the donor (B2 or B3) and acceptor formed a bi-continuous interpenetrating network in both blend films, which assures effective exciton dissociation and charge transfer channels. The B3:PC71BM blend has a better phase separation than B2:PC71BM indicating a more effective charge transfer in B3:PC71BM, which is consistent with the high value of FF for the B3:PC71BM based OSCs.

4. Conclusions
Two BODIPYs with one (B2) and two carbazole (B3) units were designed and synthesized. Their optical and electrochemical properties were investigated for their potential application as donor materials for solution processed bulk heterojunction organic solar cells employing PCBM as an electron acceptor. The optimized B2:PC71BM and B3:PC71BM based OSCs showed an overall PCE of 6.41% and 7.47%, respectively. The higher PCE of B3:PC71BM than that of B2:PC71BM is mainly due to the enhanced values of Jsc and FF and may be related to the better charge transport and exciton dissociation. These values of the PCE are highest among the values reported for BODIPY based donors and PC71BM as the acceptor. Moreover, these BODIPYs can be explored as donors for OSCs based on non-fullerene acceptors and higher PCE can be achieved as compared to fullerene based acceptors. The optical absorption spectra and frontier energy levels of B2 and B3 may also be suitable for non-fullerene acceptors since these two small molecules showed complementary absorption spectra and can be employed for ternary OSCs. We are working in this direction and expecting to achieve higher PCEs.
