E-mail: Lara.Halaoui@aub.edu.lbReceived 21st November 2008, Accepted 24th April 2009First published on 27th May 2009AbstractSignificant charge separation and potential-dependent photocurrent polarity switching are reported at multilayers of polyacrylate-capped CdS quantum dots (Q-CdS, 〈d〉 = 3.6 ±0.5 nm) assembled in poly(diallydimethylammonium chloride) with an alkaline sulfide solution interface. The films were deposited by dip self-assembly or dip–spin self-assembly, and photocurrents were enhanced up to 2-fold by the latter method and reached a maximum at 4–6 bilayers. The monochromatic incident-photon-to-current-conversion efficiency equalled 6.5% at 340 nm and 2.1% at 440 nm at a 6-bilayer film in the sulfide electrolyte. The photocurrent magnitude and direction were found to depend on the assembly method, number of bilayers, film history, electrode potential and solution redox species. While significant anodic and cathodic photocurrents were measured in sulfide, the film acted predominantly as a photocathode in the presence of another hole scavenger, ascorbic acid. Charge separation leading to a cathodic photocurrent in the presence of hole scavengers is possibly mediated by a photo-oxidized species in the multilayers, which facilitates net photogenerated hole transfer to the electrode at reducing potentials.1. IntroductionSemiconductor quantum dots (QD) exhibit novel electronic and optoelectronic properties,1,2 placing them at the center of significant research for a range of potential applications including the development of low-cost and high efficiency third-generation solar cells.3,4 As the semiconductor dimension approaches its exciton diameter, quantum confinement results in eigenspectrum quantization and a size-dependent energy gap.1,2 This can be coupled with an enhanced surface-to-volume ratio at the nanoscale; the example by Grätzel and coworkers in the 1990s of a Ru-complex sensitized nano-TiO2 solar cell with 10% efficiency has been an important development in this area, benefiting from the latter nanoscale effect.5Research on QD solar cells6 is driven by theoretical predictions that these devices can exceed the Shockley–Queisser thermodynamic limit of 31% for conversion of unconcentrated sunlight at a single semiconductor,7 by using photogenerated carriers with excess kinetic energy (hot carriers) upon absorption of light energy larger than the gap (Eg).6,8 This could be achieved if these carriers can be captured before relaxing to the band edges, thus increasing the photovoltage; or if they lead to multiple exciton generation MEG (carrier multiplication CM) at photon energy at least twice Eg, a process known in the bulk as impact ionization, thus increasing the cell photocurrent.9 These processes could potentially be more efficient in QDs because phonon-mediated carrier relaxation to the band edges is predicted to become slower due to the discrete energy spectrum (phonon bottleneck);8–10 and because of a possible relaxation of momentum conservation restriction as a result of spatial confinement.9 Recent measurements of significant MEG in seven QDs (PbS, PbSe, PbTe, CdSe, InAs, and Si)11–21 and films22 led to increasing interest; but a controversy emerged because of disagreeing results on the efficiency of MEG in PbS and PbSe23 and reports on its absence in CdSe, CdTe,24 InAs/CdSe/ZnS,25 and irreproducibility of earlier observation in InAs26 QDs. Most recently, variations in QD surfaces were suggested to have caused differences in MEG efficiency.27So far, no evidence of photocurrent enhancement in a QD solar cell has been reported.9 Several challenges would have to be overcome for these systems to achieve their potentiality and lead to efficient low-cost photovoltaic (PV) or photoelectrochemical (PEC) cells. These include ensuring electronic coupling between QDs that would allow fast charge separation and charge collection, faster than charge cooling and competing processes of charge recombination, without sacrificing quantum confinement effects.9,27 Other problems include the instability of QD films, sensitivity of QDs to oxidation in air28 or photooxidative degradation in the electrochemical medium, environmental concerns, and understanding the role of the QD surface, capping ligand, film treatments, and interparticle distances on the QD film properties.9,27,28 Harvesting solar energy in nanostructured devices therefore necessitates assembly of QDs and understanding the governing photophysics and photochemistry of these assemblies.Studies of the PEC and PV behavior of QD assemblies have focused on several architectures. In the first, QDs (e.g., CdS, CdSe, PbS, InP, Bi2S3, InAs…) were used in lieu of molecular dyes to sensitize nano-TiO2 or other wide band gap semiconductors.29–35 In a second approach, QDs or nanorods (viz, CdSe) were dispersed in organic hole-transport polymers in hybrid photovoltaic cells.36–38 In a third recently reported architecture, metal/Q-dot (PbSe, PbS, or CdSe) film/metal Schottky junctions were deposited via layer-by-layer dip coating39 or spin coating,40 resulting in a solar power conversion of 2.1% or 1.8% at Q-PbSe39 or Q-PbS40 films, repectively. In a fourth architecture, QDs (e.g., CdS, PbS) are assembled as photoelectrodes with a liquid interface containing hole scavengers or electron acceptors.41–58 Film fabrication methods in the latter case have included monolayer self-assembly via surface modifiers,41–48 chemical deposition on modified-electrodes,50,51 and Langmuir–Blodgett films.53,54 Small magnitude anodic photocurrents were observed in the presence of hole scavengers41–53 or cathodic photocurrents with electron acceptors.42,45,46Systematic photoelectrochemistry studies at QD assemblies with a liquid interface as a function of redox species, the assembly architecture, surface packing and QD surface and ligand are necessary for understanding fundamental behavior and for potential utilization in PEC cells. An assembly method that gained widespread applicability is the layer-by-layer assembly of QDs in polyelectrolyte multilayers by electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions.55–58 This method can allow facile control of film thickness and coverage of QD and other material in heterostructures, and could permit charge and mass transport in stable multilayers, leading with a suitable interface to charge separation in PEC cells. Kotov et al. reported anodic photocurrents at TiO2 NP and TiO2 with CdS NP assembled in poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDDA),55 and we reported anodic or cathodic photocurrents depending on the applied potential at multilayers of polyacrylate-modified (PAC-) Q-CdS (3.6 ± 05 nm)/PDDA in phosphate solutions but the small magnitude indicated inefficient charge separation and the Q-CdS/PDDA films were unstable due to QD photooxidation.56 More recently, Girault and coworkers also observed a bidirectional photocurrent at poly-L-lysine/CdSe or /CdSe@CdS multilayers in 1,2-dichloroethane, but the incident-photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) remained at 0.1% at (pLys/CdSe@CdS)10 at 442 nm.57,58In this work, we investigated the photoelectrochemical behavior of PAC-modified Q-CdS assembled in polyelectrolyte multilayers in the presence of hole scavengers. Two assembly protocols were employed, a dip self-assembly and a dip–spin self-assembly. We report a significant enhancement of photogenerated charge separation at (PDDA/PAC-Q-CdS)n multilayers (n is the bilayer number) with an alkaline sulfide aqueous interface leading to a monochromatic IPCE of 6.5% at 340 nm and 2.1% at 440 nm at (PDDA/PAC-Q-CdS)6 and to photocurrents reaching 0.2–0.3 mA cm−2 at n = 4–6 under 110–120 mW cm−2 light intensity. Films assembled via dip–spin SA exhibited a 2-fold enhancement in photocurrent magnitude compared to dip SA. The photocurrent magnitude and direction were found to also depend on the multilayer number, film history, and solution redox species. In the presence of S2−, significant anodic or cathodic photocurrents were measured depending on the applied potential, while the film acted predominantly as a photocathode with another hole scavenger, ascorbic acid. The enhanced cathodic photocurrent in the presence of hole scavengers is attributed to charge separation mediated by a photo-oxidized species in the multilayers, which facilitates net photogenerated hole transfer to the electrode at reducing potentials.2. Experimental2.1 MaterialsCadmium chloride, CdCl2·H2O (Acros Organics); sodium sulfide nonahydrate, Na2S·9H2O, (Alfa Aesar); poly(acrylic acid) sodium salt, PAC, Mwt 2100 (Aldrich); poly(diallyldimethyl ammonium chloride), PDDA, 20 wt % in water, Mwt 200–350 kDa (Aldrich); ascorbic acid (99% purity, Aldrich); sodium chloride (Aldrich); sodium hydroxide (Aldrich); sodium thiosulfate, Na2S2O3 (Baker); 28–30 wt % ammonium hydroxide (Acros); 98% sulfuric acid (EMD); 35% hydrogen peroxide (Aldrich); 85% o-phosphoric acid (Fisher); sodium phosphate tribasic (Mallinckrodt); sodium phosphate dibasic anhydrous (Acros); and double distilled (dd) water were used.2.2 Synthesis of Q-CdS particlesPolyacrylate (PAC)-capped CdS quantum dots (Q-CdS) were prepared as previously described.59 Briefly, 330 μL of 1 M CdCl2 (aq) were added to 1.683 g PAC/100 mL (aq) solution followed by addition of 250 μl of 1M Na2S (aq) while stirring. This resulted in a yellow colloidal Q-CdS solution. The solution was stored in the dark at 4 °C for at least 24 h before film assembly.2.3 Assembly of PDDA/Q-CdS filmsQ-CdS dots were assembled on PDDA on tin indium oxide coated glass (ITO, coated one side, Delta Technologies, Ltd, Rs = 8–12 Ω), quartz substrates (G. M. Associates, Inc.), or silicon wafers for electrochemical or UV-visible absorbance measurements, or AFM imaging, respectively. Electrodes were cleaned for 30 min in boiling ethanol and for 30 min in warm 7:3 (v/v) 28% NH3:35% H2O2 (aq) solution. Quartz and silicon substrates were treated by dipping in piranha (7:3 (v/v) 98% H2SO4:35% H2O2) for 30 min.CdS NPs were assembled on PDDA layer-by-layer following a previously described protocol, termed dip self-assembly (dip SA),41 or via an alternative method termed dip–spin SA. In the dip SA, substrates were immersed in 10 mM PDDA–0.4 M NaCl (aq) solution (the polymer concentration is for the repeat unit) for 30 min, rinsed twice 1 min each in dd water, air-dried for 10 min, then dipped in the Q-CdS solution for 1 h, rinsed for 1 min in water and air-dried for 15 min. In the dip–spin SA, the same dipping/rinsing protocol (without the drying step) was followed with the variation of spinning the substrate for 1 min at 5000 rpm (using a spin coating device, KW-4A, Chemat Technology) after each dipping step in the polyelectrolyte solution and in the Q-CdS solution, and spinning the substrate again for 1 min at 5000 rpm once after the rinsing step (consisting of 2 × 1 min rinse). There were no drying steps in this procedure. Multilayers were assembled by repeating the procedure n times (n = 1–10), an n-bilayer film is designated (PDDA/Q-CdS)n. UV-visible absorbance spectra (of films on quartz) were collected with a Spectronic Genesis 2 spectrophotometer.2.4 Electrodeposition of thin CdS filmsThin CdS films were electrodeposited on ITO from an aqueous solution of 0.1 M CdCl2 and 0.01 M sodium thiosulfate (pH adjusted to 2.65 with HCl) at 60 °C, in a 3-electrode cell with a Ag/AgCl reference (Pine instruments, or home-made in saturated KCl) and a Pt wire auxiliary electrode, at −0.65 V for 3 h. A yellow film formed, its thickness was measured to be ca. 75 nm with Ambios XP-1 profilometer.2.5 Photoelectrochemical measurementsPhotolectrochemical measurements were acquired with a CHI630A (CH Instruments) electrochemical workstation in a 3-electrode quartz cell with a Ag/AgCl reference and a Pt wire (diam. = 2 mm) counter electrode. All potentials are reported relative to Ag/AgCl. Solutions were deoxygenated by bubbling N2 (g) for at least 30 min, and a blanket was maintained during measurements. Measurements were acquired under chopped-illumination (home-made light chopper) from a 300 W Xe lamp operated at 250 W (Model 66901 lamp housing and Model 68911 power supply, Oriel Instruments). Chopped-illumination allows continued monitoring of photocurrent vs. dark current in a potential scan. Films were assembled on both sides of ITO, and the conductive surface faced the incident light. The light intensity was measured with a Thermopile light detector and power meter (Model 70260, Oriel Instruments) to be ca. 110–120 mW cm−2 at the electrode position.To collect photocurrent action spectra, light was dispersed using a grating monochromator (Oriel Model 77200). I–t curves were acquired at 100 mV (vs. Ag/AgCl) under chopped-illumination, and photocurrents were measured at 60 s after dark current subtraction. The IPCE at a potential V = 100 mV was calculated according to:  (1) where J is the photocurrent density at V, and I is the light intensity at λ. The average quantum yield Φ (absorbed photon to current conversion efficiency) was calculated by substituting the absorbed light intensity (from film absorbance on quartz) according to: (2)where 〈% IPCE〉 is the average IPCE at V, Iabs is the absorbed light intensity at λ calculated from the light power at the electrode position and film absorbance (A) at λ. (The absorbance of a (PDDA/Q-CdS)4 film on quartz was measured from the UV-visible spectrum after subtraction of background absorbance at 560 nm and was divided by 2 to account for absorbance of the active film on (one side of) ITO). Solution absorption or scattering losses were not corrected for.2.6 MicroscopyPDDA/Q-CdS films were directly assembled on SiOx-coated Cu grids (SPI) for TEM imaging. Assembly by dip SA and dip–spin SA followed the same procedure described above except that the films were allowed to float face-down at the solution/air interface in order to assemble on a single face of the grid. For dip–spin SA, a home-made grid holder (with a short tweezer-like tip that holds the grid from one side) allowed the grids to float on the solution/air interface and then be rotated immediately at 5000 rpm for 1 min, without causing significant bending in the grids. TEM images were acquired on a JEOL-2011 high-resolution transmission electron microscope (by Dr Yan Xin, at the NHMFL, Florida State University) operated at 200 kV with a point resolution of 0.23 nm and a lattice resolution of 0.14 nm. AFM images were acquired of films assembled on single crystal silicon (to ensure that small features can be distinguished on the flat surface) using Tapping Mode imaging on a Nanoscope IIIa (Digital Instruments) with a Silicon cantilever tip (50 N m−1 spring constant, r < 10 nm; VISTA probes, nanoScience Instruments). Roughness measurements were acquired using the Nanoscope software (Digital instruments).3. Results and discussion3.1 Q-CdS/PDDA multilayers by dip–spin self-assemblyPAC-capped Q-CdS were characterized by TEM as zinc-blende nanocrystals with 3.6 ± 0.5 nm average dimension,59 and exhibited an absorption edge around 460 nm or 2.7 eV energy gap, 0.2 eV larger than the bulk band gap as a result of quantum confinement.1–2,59 The QDs were previously shown to assemble on a cationic polyelectrolyte, PDDA, by electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions by dip self-assembly (dip SA) which consists of alternately dipping a substrate in polyelectrolyte and NP solutions.56,59 Motivated by improving light harvesting, a variant of the assembly was investigated by introducing substrate spinning (at 5000 rpm) after dipping and after rinsing (dip–spin SA). Fig. 1 shows UV-visible absorbance spectra of PDDA/Q-CdS bilayers deposited by this method. Film absorbance (plotted at 350 nm, inset) increased linearly with the number of bilayers, reflecting reproducible surface charge reversal and NP adsorption per layer. Introducing high-speed rotation caused a 1.5-fold increase in Q-CdS coverage per PDDA layer as indicated from absorbance measurements. Fig. 1  UV-visible absorbance spectra of 1-9 PDDA/Q-CdS bilayers assembled by dip–spin SA on quartz (a), and plots of film absorbance at 350 nm vs. the number of bilayers (n) by dip SA and dip–spin SA methods (inset). TEM images of 2 and 4 bilayers revealed a higher QD surface coverage by dip–spin SA, in agreement with absorption measurements. Differences in NP adsorption are particularly evident when comparing images of (PDDA/Q-CdS)2 prepared by the 2 protocols (in Fig. 2 and Fig. S1†). A fractal NP surface distribution with uncovered islands is observed in the dip SA film, and higher magnification shows no evidence of NP adsorption in these islands (Fig. 2D). Imaging different areas of the same film (cf. Fig. S1†) revealed the presence of areas with even less uniform and lower coverage than shown in Fig. 2C. Although a fractal distribution is also to some extent apparent in micrographs of 2 bilayers by dip–spin SA (Fig. 2A), the surface distribution is more uniform and NPs are clearly observed at higher magnification in the lighter islands, in what could possibly be NPs adsorbed on the underlying first PDDA layer (cf. arrows in Fig. 2B). Similarly, TEM images of 4 bilayers (Fig. 3) showed a fractal surface distribution and a less uniform and lower QD coverage for dip SA films. NP adsorption was also evident across the surface of 4 bilayers by dip–spin SA (arrows in Fig. 3B), while several areas still remained uncovered in the dip SA film (Fig. 3D). The NP surface distributions in 4 bilayers and 2 bilayers adsorbed by dip–spin SA did not appear to be generally different, which could have resulted from a consistent NP distribution per layer. The results for dip SA films are in agreement with earlier observations of a fractal NP distribution in 1 bilayer of Q-CdS/PDDA59 and in PAC-Pt NPs/PDDA multilayers by dip SA.60 It was thought that an underlying coiled morphology of PDDA adsorbed from 0.4 M NaCl medium could have contributed to the observed fractal NP distribution.60 Fig. 2  TEM images of (PDDA/Q-CdS)2 assembled via dip–spin SA (A,B), or dip SA (C,D).  Fig. 3  TEM images of (PDDA/Q-CdS)4 assembled via dip–spin SA (A,B), or dip SA (C,D). AFM images of (PDDA/Q-CdS)4 (Fig. 4) also showed differences in the surface morphology between the two assembly methods. The dip SA films exhibited a topography characterized by large islands with horizontal dimension of ca. 50–100 nm and vertical dimension of ca. 7–15 nm; whereas dip–spin SA films exhibited smoother nanoscale features and revealed nanosize channels, with a high NP distribution observed upon closely imaging around these channels (cf.Fig. 2B inset). Cross-sectional analysis showed particles with vertical dimension of 2–5 nm, consistent with the Q-CdS average dimension (〈d〉 = 3.6 ± 0.5 nm); a higher density of NPs and a more uniform surface distribution appear in films prepared by dip–spin SA (by comparing Fig. 4B and 4D), in agreement with UV-visible absorption and TEM imaging. Fig. 4  AFM tapping mode images of (PDDA/Q-CdS)4 assembled via dip–spin SA (A,B), or dip SA (C,D). Cho et al. reported a spin self-assembly (spin-SA) method to deposit polyelectrolyte and Q-CdS/polyelectrolyte multilayers by spinning the substrate at 4000 rpm after casting solutions.61 Increased adsorption was observed, and was attributed to an increase in polyelectrolyte or NP concentration and to higher electrostatic attraction caused by fast surface water removal.61 The authors also observed using X-ray reflectivity an ordered internal structure in poly(allylamine hydrochloride) PAH/Q-CdS multilayers and reported a reduced surface roughness for spin SA films (e.g., from 18 Å to 5 Å for (PAH/Q-CdS)20 adsorbed without added salt) which was attributed to the air shear force effect causing rearrangement and flattening of the film.61 Although in the dip–spin SA method here polyelectrolyte and NP were allowed to adsorb in solution first before spinning, similar forces are at work including the air-shear force and electrostatic interactions. AFM images revealed a rougher film surface in comparison with the report of Cho et al.61 with an average roughness of 6.9 nm or 8.6 nm for spin-dip SA and dip SA, respectively (from the 5 × 5 μm2 scans in Fig. 4); which must be due to polyelectrolyte adsorption from the high ionic strength medium (0.4 M NaCl). Roughness measurements of different scans showed comparable numbers for dip and dip–spin films, however a notable difference was the absence of the large islands corresponding to polyelectrolyte in AFM images of dip–spin SA films, which shows that high speed rotation causes a different rearrangement of polyelectrolyte on the surface.Earlier we studied the assembly dynamics of similarly modified PAC-Pt NPs (2.5 nm PAC-Pt NP) on PDDA by dip SA and found that it follows two kinetics regimes; the initial rate was thought to be determined by NP availability at the interface, while at high coverage slow surface rearrangement to open adsorption sites becomes rate-limiting resulting in pseudo-saturation.62 It is possible that forces caused by substrate spinning along with fast drying can also lead to faster reorganization which may open adsorption sites, accordingly weakly adsorbed material that would otherwise be washed off as excess charge now adsorbs on these sites. The different surface topography in the AFM images supports this picture, in which case the larger islands (ascribed to the polyelectrolyte) in the dip SA films must present less favored adsorption sites (NPs were not observed atop these islands), which could explain the fractal distribution observed in TEM images and the less uniform coverage by dip SA. The high speed rotation must have opened a more uniform adsorption site distribution, leading to the uniform surface coverage per layer by dip–spin SA.3.2 Photocurrent generation at (PDDA/Q-CdS)4 films in sulfide3.2.1 General photoelectrochemical characterization in Na2S, NaOH. Photocurrent action spectra (vide infra) collected at PDDA/Q-CdS films in 0.1 M Na2S in 0.2 M NaOH aqueous solution (pH = 12.6) exhibited a photocurrent onset at ∼460–480 nm consistent with Q-CdS absorption onset. The average monochromatic IPCE at 100 mV (vs. Ag/AgCl) measured at six (PDDA/Q-CdS)4 films from different preparations by dip–spin SA equalled 1.5 ± 0.38% at 420 nm and 3.8 ± 0.42% at 340 nm in this electrolyte, and the average quantum yield Φ was estimated from the IPCE at this films’ set to reach 20% at 360–380 nm.Current–voltage plots with chopped-illumination at (PDDA/Q-CdS)4 in deoxygenated 0.1 M Na2S/0.2 M NaOH solution featured significant anodic or cathodic photocurrents depending on the applied potential (Fig. 5a). The photocurrent switched direction in the range of −350 to −400 mV (zero-current potential). I–V curves at ITO (Fig. 5a,iii) showed only small anodic and cathodic photocurrents. Amperometric curves at Q-CdS films exhibited cathodic current transients at light onset, while anodic photocurrent transients were not detected (Fig. S2, in the ESI†). In the aspect of potential dependent photocurrent polarity-switching in the presence of S2−, the behavior differs markedly from typical n-type bulk CdS behavior. To illustrate this, a photocurrent–voltage plot at a thin electrodeposited CdS film in sulfide is shown in Fig. S3† featuring anodic photocurrents with an onset ca.−1.1–−1.16 V.63 A mechanism leading to the behavior of the Q-CdS/PDDA films is discussed below. Fig. 5  I–V plots under chopped-illumination at (PDDA/Q-CdS)4 films prepared by dip–spin SA (i) or dip SA (ii) and at unmodified ITO (iii) in deoxygenated 0.1 M Na2S in 0.2 M NaOH solution (a), and at a (PDDA/Q-CdS)4 film prepared by dip–spin SA in deoxygenated 0.2 M NaOH (b). Scan rate is 20 mV s−1. The role of S2− in enhancing charge separation and in leading to the observed bidirectional photocurrent was evident. While photocurrent–voltage curves in 0.2 M NaOH featured only anodic photocurrents with an onset at −1.07 V (Fig. 5b, at (PDDA/Q-CdS)4 by dip–spin SA), the sulfide ion caused a 20-fold anodic photocurrent enhancement and a reversal of current polarity negative of −400 mV. S2− also appears to have affected the QD energetics in solution, causing a −300 mV shift in photocurrent onset to ca.–1.4 V (cf. Fig. S4†). A similar shift (of ∼−300 mV) in flat band potential (Vfb) of single crystal CdS was reported by Finlayson et al. at this pH in 0.1 M Na2S (estimated from Fig. 2 in ref. 64) and a −350 mV shift was measured in polysulfide by Wrighton and coworkers,65 caused by sulfide adsorption. This indicates a similar action of sulfide on the modified-Q-CdS energetics, surface modification by polyacrylate notwithstanding. Furthermore, S2− stabilized the PDDA/Q-CdS films by scavenging holes and preventing their attack of the lattice, also identical to its function with bulk cadmium chalcogenide.65,66 This is indicated by the reverse (negative to positive) I–V scans (Fig. S5†) in sulfide following the forward scan, whereas a significant irreversible surface change would have manifested in hysteresis.3.2.2 Effect of the film assembly method on charge separation. Improved photocurrent magnitude was measured at films with the same number of bilayers fabricated via the dip–spin SA compared to dip SA, as shown in Fig. 5a at (PDDA/Q-CdS)4 in sulfide. Photocurrents were ca. 2-fold higher at potentials negative of 200 mV at the former films (or 1.6-times higher positive of 200 mV), which is attributed in part to higher absorbance due to their higher Q-CdS coverage. The enhancement at some potentials was however larger than the 1.5-fold increase in NP absorbance. It is possible that a higher Q-CdS coverage or the different NP and polyelectrolyte surface distribution in dip–spin SA films could have facilitated charge transport thus enhancing charge separation, causing the additional increase in photocurrent magnitude relative to dip SA films. TEM images of 2 and 4 bilayers by dip–spin SA showed a relatively uniform NP surface distribution with coverage across the surface, revealing NPs apparently adsorbed in underlying layers, while in the dip SA films some areas were not covered with NPs. The less fractal NP distribution with NP coverage across the film in underlying layers could have provided a more continuous pathway for charge transport via charge hopping between NPs in dip–spin SA films (at least in these areas fully covered with NPs), leading to enhancing the photocurrent beyond the difference in absorbance relative to dip SA films. The presence of the larger polyelectrolyte nanoscale structures in dip SA films could have also presented an additional barrier to charge transport and hence to charge separation in these films, leading to the observed difference in photocurrent magnitude.3.3 Dependence of the photocurrent on the number of PDDA/Q-CdS multilayersEnhancing light conversion by increasing NP coverage in multilayers was studied in sulfide at 2–10 bilayers deposited by dip–spin SA, and photocurrents were found to reach their highest magnitude at n = 4–6. Under monochromatic light, the IPCE increased significantly from 2 to 4 bilayers, and continued to increase to 6 bilayers (Fig. 6a, currents in Fig. S6†). The IPCE at 6 bilayers (at 100 mV vs. Ag/AgCl) equalled 2.1% at 440 nm in sulfide; and a highest IPCE of 6.5% was measured at 340 nm at (PDDA/Q-CdS)6, compared to 4.1% at (PDDA/Q-CdS)4 and 2.1% at (PDDA/Q-CdS)2. The IPCE declined at 8 and 10 bilayers (not shown). The 1.5–1.6-fold higher efficiency at (PDDA/Q-CdS)6 relative to (PDDA/Q-CdS)4 at 340–400 nm is consistent with a same factor increase in NP density. On the other hand, the IPCE at (PDDA/Q-CdS)4 was 2.8- to 6.5-fold higher than at (PDDA/Q-CdS)2 at 360–440 nm, which is larger than can be merely ascribed to higher light absorbance by 4-bilayers. This appears to be a similar trend as the difference between films prepared by dip–spin vs. dip SA. Although it is a possibility that higher NP coverage or continued reorganization by spinning creates transport channels that improve the efficiency of charge separation in 4 bilayers compared to 2 bilayers, it could not be evident from the microscopy results in this study whether in fact a different 3-dimensional distribution occurred when 4 bilayers are reached compared to 2 bilayers (as the 2-dimensional surface distribution appeared similar in TEM images), that could explain the significant enhancement in IPCE at 4 bilayers. Fig. 6  Photoanodic current action spectra (% IPCE at 100 mV vs. Ag/AgCl vs. wavelength) at (PDDA/Q-CdS)n bilayers n = 2, 4, 6 prepared by dip–spin SA in deoxygenated 0.1 M Na2S/0.2 M NaOH (a), and I–V plots under chopped-illumination at bilayers n = 2, 4, 6, 8 in the same electrolyte at 20 mV s−1 (b). Under white-light illumination of 110–120 mW cm−2, a 4-fold enhancement in photocurrent was also measured from 2 to 4 bilayers in sulfide but increasing the number of bilayers beyond 6 caused only a small increase or decrease in photocurrent, as shown in Fig. 6b. Corresponding anodic and cathodic photocurrents (measured from I–V plots at ∼75–110 mV, and −630–(−665 mV), respectively) are plotted vs. n in Fig. S7.†The photocurrent generation efficiency depends on the yield of carrier generation and the efficiency of charge separation before e–h recombination. The lack of proportionate increase in photocurrent with the number of bilayers must be caused by a limiting rate possibly of charge transport with increased distance from ITO and competition from e–h recombination with increasing carrier density; and this is consistent with earlier measurements at these films in the absence of sulfide.56 It is possible that the IPCE increase at (PDDA/Q-CdS)6 relative to (PDDA/Q-CdS)4 (at ca. 2.7 mW cm−2) which was not of the same magnitude under white light (110–120 mW cm−2) is caused by a lower carrier density in the former case causing lower recombination rates.3.4 Photoelectrochemistry at PDDA/Q-CdS films in ascorbic acidWhile potential-dependent photocurrent polarity-switching with appreciable anodic or cathodic photocurrent magnitude was observed in a sulfide solution, the PDDA/Q-CdS assemblies acted predominantly as photocathodes in the presence of another hole scavenger, ascorbic acid (H2A). Cyclic voltammograms under chopped-illumination at (PDDA/Q-CdS)4 and at a thin electrodeposited CdS film in deoxygenated 0.1 M H2A (pH 2.6) are presented in Fig. 7, and feature cathodic photocurrents negative of 120 mV at potentials where anodic photocurrents flow at the bulk film. Small anodic photocurrents (ca. 1–3 μA cm−2) were measured positive of 160 mV at (PDDA/Q-CdS)4 and were accompanied by the onset of dark oxidation. Cathodic photocurrents at the assemblies in (0.1 M) phosphate buffer pH 2.6 were insignificant in comparison therefore charge separation leading to cathodic photocurrents involved the electron donor H2A.

Scan rate is 20 mV s−1. 3.5 Discussion of the photoelectrochemical behavior of PDDA/Q-CdS film electrodes3.5.1 Bidirectional photocurrent generation at nanocrystalline and bulk semiconductors. At bulk semiconductors, band bending in the space charge region results in separation of photogenerated carriers by a field created between the bulk and the surface, and consequently (generally) in the flow of anodic or cathodic photocurrents at n-type or p-type semiconductors, respectively. Charge separation in QD films is known to take place by a different mechanism because of the absence of band bending and a space charge region in the nanosize QDs.42 In this case, the carriers wavefunctions are predicted to extend to the surface and the medium because of spatial confinement, and competition between recombination, photooxidation and photoreduction reactions at the QDs, and charge transfer to the collector electrode would determine the net reaction and current polarity, leading to redox- and/or potential-dependent photocurrent direction.A bidirectional photocurrent was reported by Ogawa et al. at a Q-PbS monolayer with a polarity that depended on the solution redox species,42 being anodic in the presence of a hole scavenger (reduced methyl viologen MV+˙, attributed to its photooxidation) or cathodic with an electron acceptor (benzoquinone, attributed to its photoreduction), while a potential-dependent polarity-switch was observed in the presence of both sacrificial hole and electron scavengers (S2−/Sx2−).42 Similarly, Gill et al. observed anodic photocurrent at CdS NP/DNA assembly with an electron donor (triethanolamine) or cathodic photocurrent with an electron acceptor (oxygen),46 and Bakkers et al. reported an anodic photocurrent at Q-PbS monolayer with tartrate and cathodic photocurrent with Fe(CN)63−.45 A potential-dependent photocurrent polarity-switch was reported earlier by this Lab at PDDA/Q-CdS assemblies in oxygenated and deoxygenated phosphate solutions,56 and recently by Hojeiji et al. at L-lysine/CdSe or L-lysine/CdSe@CdS multilayers in 1,2-dichloroethane.58 This behavior was also observed at TiO2 NP on Ni derivatized with nickel hexacyanoferrate; the photocathodic current was attributed to hole transfer to Fe(II) film sites and electron transfer to solution O2.67 Other studies reported anodic photocurrents at the CdS NP film/electron donor,41–53e.g., with Na2SO350,51 or triethanolamine41,47,48 in aqueous medium, or with triethylamine in THF,49 which were ascribed to hole scavenging by the electron donor and transfer of photogenerated electrons to the electrode, at times facilitated by carbon nanotubes,48 intercalated redox species46 or film functionality47 of the proper redox state.Surface states have also been implicated in photocurrent polarity reversal. Kronik et al. reported a switch from n-type to p-type behavior at CdSe nanocrystalline films in polysulfide following an etch in acid, attributed to preferential trapping of charge carriers at the surface.68 Anomalous cathodic photocurrent flow at a bulk n-type semiconductor has been observed and ascribed to photogenerated electron transfer mediated by surface states.69,703.5.2 Discussion of photoelectrochemistry at Q-CdS/PDDA films in sulfide. In this study, a potential-dependent photocurrent polarity-switch was a distinct feature of the photoelectrochemistry at PDDA/Q-CdS assemblies in the presence of S2− and the absence of a sacrificial electron acceptor. An appreciable charge separation resulted in an IPCE of 6.5% at 340 nm and 2.1% at 440 nm at (PDDA/Q-CdS)6 at 100 mV (vs. reference).Scheme 1 shows the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of 3.6 nm Q-CdS, calculated using the effective mass model (EMM)2,71 approximation (relative to the bulk based on Vfb and CB edges from ref. 64), the redox potential of H+/H2 in the same electrolyte and the standard redox potential of S2−/Sx2− (the redox potential here is not well defined since there was no sulfur added, and will be shifted negative of the standard potential upon buildup of sulfur). The EMM yields an overestimation of quantum confinement71 therefore the bulk band edges are also shown in the scheme (as a lower limit of the energies). At an illuminated ITO/PDDA/Q-CdS/S2−,OH− interface at potential E, charge transfer processes thought to take place are summarized (numbered) in Appendix A. Proton reduction at CdS (5) is thermodynamically feasible but kinetically sluggish in the absence of a co-catalyst,72 whereas hole scavenging by S2− (3) is efficient and protects cadmium chalcogenides from dissolution.65,66 Red-shifted photoluminescence provides evidence of surface state (SS) presence,59 and cathodic photocurrent transients (in I-t curves) could indicate SS involvement in charge transfer. Processes of electron transport in the film are perceived to occur via charge hopping between NPs. Electrode here refers to ITO. Scheme 1  Sketches showing the predominant charge transfer processes at ITO/(PDDA/Q-CdS)n/0.1 M Na2S, 0.2 M NaOH leading to anodic (A) or cathodic photocurrent (B). The redox potentials of solution species and the HOMO and LUMO approximated by the EMM for 3.6 nm CdS particle are shown. The processes and their numbering are described in Appendix A. A more detailed Scheme S1 showing other possible competing processes (presented in Appendix A) is shown in the ESI.† A comprehensive picture of the various competing photoelectrochemical and recombination processes which are numbered in Appendix A is presented in Scheme S1 (ESI),† and shows other possible interactions in the system. Only the predominant processes resulting in photogenerated charge separation leading to anodic or cathodic photocurrents are presented in Scheme 1. The anodic photocurrent positive of ca.−350 mV (Scheme 1A) indicates a predominant transport of photogenerated electrons (4) to the electrode competing with electron trapping (2a) or the kinetically-slower hydrogen evolution (5), and efficient scavenging of the holes by S2− (3a, 3b), competing with e–h recombination. The potential-dependent magnitude indicates a potential-dependent net transport of photogenerated electrons; the decrease in anodic photocurrent with less positive bias can be attributed to a decrease in the electron transfer/transport rate (4) due to a decrease in the driving force (potential difference in the film). At more negative potentials (Scheme 1B), the polarity-switch indicates a net photogenerated hole transport to the electrode and a predominant photoreduction. There are two possible pathways for the hole transport. The first is by direct electron transport from ITO to react with holes in the film (7, Scheme S-1B), and competing with the efficient hole capturing by S2− (3). A second pathway (6) is mediated by the photooxidized species S22− (produced by 3), possibly transiently trapped by slowed mass transport in the films; in other words, the electrode acts as a collector at reducing potentials for the disulfide species. The fate of the separated photogenerated electrons would be to photoreduce PAC-Q-CdS by trapping at SS and/or photocatalyze hydrogen evolution (5). Generation of a small cathodic photocurrent in phosphate solution56 and of only anodic photocurrent in NaOH (in the absence of sulfide) supports the second pathway. The argument is that if a sufficiently negative potential increases the rate of electron transfer from ITO to Q-CdS (7) to directly separate the photogenerated hole, the same or larger cathodic photocurrent should be generated in the absence of competition from hole scavenging by S2−.73 The flow of a cathodic photocurrent at PDDA/Q-CdS in NaOH following I–V scans in sulfide (shown in Fig. S8†) further supports the involvement of a sulfur species in charge transport, cf. further discussion in the ESI.3.5.3 Discussion of cathodic photocurrent generation in ascorbic acid solutions. A predominantly cathodic photocurrent in ascorbic acid can be explained by this model by invoking a redox species capable of facilitating hole transport to the electrode. The electrooxidation of ascorbic acid is a 2-e process followed by a fast chemical reaction.74,75 Ruiz et al.76 proposed a first step of deprotonation of H2A to HA− followed by a 1-e oxidation and deprotonation to yield the radical anion A−., and a second 1-e oxidation to form dehydroascorbic acid (A). Subsequent fast protonation and hydration yield 2,3-diketogulonic acid. The redox potential  for the first electron transfer is calculated from data and equations by Steenken et al.77 to be 0.47 V vs. Ag/AgCl at pH 2.6 and the redox potential  of the second electron transfer is estimated ca. 0.04 V at pH 2.6 from ref. 78. The HOMO energy of 3.6 nm Q-CdS at this pH is approximated at 2.17 V using the EMM taking as reference Vfb of single crystal CdS (Fig. 8 in ref. 64). These numbers show the thermodynamic feasibility of both photooxidation reactions at Q-CdS. Experimentally, a significant anodic photocurrent at the thin CdS film in H2A shows the feasibility of this electron donor scavenging photogenerated holes from the bulk valence band.The onset of dark oxidation at PDDA/Q-CdS films led to a relatively small anodic photocurrent in H2A, and the films behaved predominantly as a photocathode. The cathodic photocurrent indicates a photoreduction at Q-CdS and a net electron transport from the electrode to react with Q-CdS photogenerated holes. Since H2A was necessary for the cathodic photocurrent flow, it is proposed that charge transport could be mediated by a photooxidation product (similar to process 6), here either by the radical anion A−˙ or dehydroascorbic acid A. In this case, reduction of produced A−˙ (at favorable E) will be competing with its oxidation and its decay by disproportionation (k ca. 108 M−1 s−1 at pH 3),79–81 and reduction of A must compete with its hydration (k = 1.3–1.4 × 103 s−1 at pH 7).74,75 The proposed fate of the separated photogenerated electron is again to photoreduce PAC-Q-CdS by trapping at SS and/or photocatalyze hydrogen evolution (5). It is also possible that H2A or its intermediate photooxidation products may activate electron SS traps or passivate hole SS traps, leading to a cathodic photocurrent.The mechanism proposed can explain an earlier observation of anodic photocurrent at PDDA/Q-CdS assemblies in the presence of MV2+ as an electron acceptor.56 The anodic photocurrent at PDDA/Q-CdS/MV2+ was attributed to the electrode acting as a collector of photoreduced MV+˙.4. ConclusionsIn this study we reported a significant photogenerated charge separation and potential dependent polarity-switching at multilayers of polyacrylate-modified Q-CdS assembled in a cationic polyelectrolyte in the presence of hole scavengers. The QD films were deposited either by dip or dip–spin self-assembly, and introducing spinning to the assembly method was found to increase the photocurrent magnitude up to 2-fold partly because of higher absorbance and possibly partly due to a different NP and polyelectrolyte rearrangement by spinning. Anodic photocurrents up to 0.2–0.3 mA cm−2 at 0–200 mV (vs. Ag/AgCl) were measured, and cathodic photocurrents reached ca. 70 μA cm−2 at −750 mV in alkaline sulfide solution. The monochromatic IPCE (at 100 mV) equalled 6.5% at 340 nm and 2.1% at 440 nm at 6 bilayers. This appreciable charge separation is mainly due to efficient capturing of the holes by solution S2− and a net photogenerated electron transport to the electrode at sufficiently positive potential possibly by charge hopping between NPs. The multilayered films also act as photocathodes at certain potentials in the presence of a hole scavenger, and this is thought to be possibly mediated by photooxidation products trapped in the films. The photoelectrochemical behavior was found to be dependent on the assembly method, number of layers, film history, solution redox species and electrode potential. Further studies in this area will explore the effects of film architecture on the efficiency of charge separation and the photoelectrochemical behavior of QD in polyelectrolyte assemblies. This will include variation in the intercalating polyelectrolyte and the capping polyelectrolyte, and incorporation of other functionalities or nanoparticles in heterostructures––to enhance charge transport or to act as reaction co-catalysts.Appendix A.Summary of processes shown in Scheme 1(1) Light absorption: (2) Photogenerated charge transfer (trapping) at surface states:  2a.

A 0.5 V positive shift in band edge determination of colloidal CdS was attributed to the presence of surface states.64.M. F. Finlayson, B. L. Wheeler, N. Kakuta, K. Park, A. J. Bard, A. Campion, M.

The first excited state energy (energy gap) is approximated as the sum of the LUMO and HOMO energies minus an e–h correlation energy (coulombic interaction).2 The LUMO energy at 3.6 Q-CdS was estimated to be 0.61 eV higher than Ec of the bulk and the HOMO energy to be 0.145 eV lower than Ev. These energies are used as an approximation since the EMM gave an overestimation of quantum confinement in PAC-Q-CdS.41 In any case, the LUMO and HOMO energies are higher than the CB and VB edges of the bulk making the charge transfer reactions thermodynamically feasible.A.
