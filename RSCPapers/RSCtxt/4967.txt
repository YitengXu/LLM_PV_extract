    , Accepted 25th March 2022First published on 25th March 2022AbstractA plasmonic Z-scheme photocatalyst comprised of Ag/AgBr-decorated BiOBr/Bi2O3 nanosheets was synthesized successfully using a rapid microwave-assisted one-step approach. The Ag/AgBr particles were generated simultaneously on the surface of the BiOBr/Bi2O3 nanosheets. This construction resulted in the formation of multiplex phenomena, including the surface plasmon resonance effect of Ag particles, the photosensitive role of AgBr in enhancing visible light utilization, and efficient charge transfer processes in the quaternary heterojunction photocatalyst. The as-prepared catalyst exhibited remarkable photocatalytic activity toward the destruction of tetracycline hydrochloride (TCH) (93.7%), methyl orange (MO) (96.6%), and rhodamine B (RhB) (100%) under visible light. The catalyst exhibited high photocatalytic stability under visible light irradiation, retaining 97% of its activity after nine cycles of MO degradation. This was attributed to the multiple synergistic mechanisms of the components following the Z-scheme mechanism, which facilitated rapid charge transfer and restricted the decomposition of AgBr to achieve high efficiency and stable catalysts.

Environmental significance
We have solved the environmental wastewater treatment problem economically using an efficient photocatalyst under visible light. We have synthesized a novel Ag/AgBr@BiOBr/Bi2O3 Z-scheme photocatalyst with the help of CTAB using a microwave-assisted one-step method under mild conditions. This catalyst exhibited exceptional photodegradation efficiency for organic pollutants, such as rhodamine B (100%) and methyl orange (97%), under visible light with small loading (0.3 g L–1) and excellent stability (97% after nine cycles). The degradation efficiency with 0.5 g L–1 loading reached 98% under solar light for difficult-to-degrade tetracycline. We have studied photodegradation theoretically using the TRPL and trapping experiments to confirm the Z-scheme and the predominant role of singlet oxygen in the degradation.

1. Introduction
Economic growth with uncontrolled industrial activity has imposed significant challenges to human life, especially water pollution. To overcome this environmental problem, photocatalysis is one of the best approaches for water treatment among various water treatment techniques available, such as adsorption, chemical techniques, and electrochemical technologies.1,2 The photoinduced advanced oxidation process is a green and relatively low-cost wastewater treatment owing to the utilization of abundant solar radiation.2 Titanium dioxide (TiO2) is a promising photocatalyst because of its nontoxicity, low cost, superior redox ability, excellent photocatalytic activity, and high chemical and biological photostability.3 On the other hand, TiO2 only absorbs the UV range of solar light because of its large bandgap (3.2–3.3 eV), harvesting less than 5% of solar light,2,4 and thus leading to the restriction of photo-efficiency. In addition, it has a high rate of photoinduced electron–hole recombination. Therefore, considerable research has been conducted to find alternatives to utilize light effectively.
Recently, bismuth oxyhalides (BiOX (X = I, Cl, Br, F)) have attracted much attention in the photocatalysis field due to their high chemical stability, uniquely layered structures, and highly favorable photocatalytic performance under UV-vis irradiation.5 The BiOX family has a tetragonal matlockite-type structure with a unique layer structure of [Bi2O22+] slabs overlapped by halogen atoms.3 As one member of the BiOX family, BiOBr has been studied intensively because of its low bandgap (2.3–2.9 eV),6 superior photocatalytic activity and stability,7 and unique layered crystal structure.8 Although this layer structure is favorable for separating the electron–hole pairs effectively because of the induced dipole,7 its photocatalytic performance is still hindered by the low light absorption ability.6
Bismuth oxide (Bi2O3) has a low bandgap (2.1–2.8 eV) and remarkable properties, such as high refractive index, low cost, visible-light activity, higher oxidation power of the holes,9 non-toxicity, and non-carcinogenicity.2 With these features, Bi2O3 is considered a potential photocatalyst. Despite these advantages, its photocatalytic activity differs significantly according to the crystal structures.10 Generally, water purification using a Bi2O3 photocatalyst is a poor choice because of the high rate of photoinduced electron–hole pair recombination and photocorrosion.9 Therefore, many strategies have been designed to exploit its properties and enhance its photocatalytic performance effectively.2,4,9
Noble metallic Ag nanoparticles can act as a strong absorber for harvesting visible light owing to their surface plasmon resonance (SPR),6,11 whereas silver bromide (AgBr) plays an essential role as a light-sensitive material and a plasmonic photocatalyst.9 On the other hand, AgBr as a single-phase photocatalyst shows optical instability because it can partially decompose to Ag NPs under visible light irradiation.11 Thus, the coupling of Ag/AgBr would result in high photocatalytic activity and good stability under visible light.11,12 Nevertheless, the photocatalytic performance of the plasmonic Ag/AgBr composites could be hampered by their micrometer-scale particle sizes resulting in low surface area and the rapid recombination of electrons and holes.12
Several strategies for developing visible-light responsive photocatalysts have been studied widely to enhance their visible light-harvesting capability, photocatalytic activity, and photostability. For example, Yang et al. fabricated an AgBr/Bi2O3 catalyst using a two-step hydrothermal method to degrade methyl orange (MO).13 Li et al. prepared Ag-doped Bi2O3 nanosheets via co-precipitation (90 °C, 24 h) and calcination (500 °C, 4 h) routes for the treatment of MO.14 Dong et al. fabricated AgBr–Ag–BiOBr composites by a hydrothermal route (160 °C, 16 h) and calcination (450 °C, 4 h) for the removal of MO.6 Yan et al. used a solvothermal approach (160 °C, 10 h) to obtain Ag/AgBr/BiOBr hollow hierarchical microspheres for rhodamine B (RhB) degradation.15 Zhao et al. successfully prepared an Ag/AgCl/BiOCl nanocomposite by a solvothermal reaction (150 °C, 24 h) for RhB and tetracycline hydrochloride (TCH) removal.16 Qiu et al. reported that Z-scheme SnS2/BiOBr photocatalysts synthesized using a hydrothermal method (180 °C, 10 h) showed better activity in RhB decomposition than pure SnS2 or BiOBr.17 A Z-scheme Ag/AgBr/Bi4O5Br2 photocatalyst was also synthesized using a hydrothermal method (160 °C for 12 h) to decompose acid orange II, 4-tert-butylphenol, and aniline.18 Several studies have been conducted to improve the photocatalytic activity of catalysts. Nevertheless, these fabrication routes posed obstacles for practical applications related to their high-energy consumption, lengthy production time, complicated synthesis procedures, and environmental problems from toxic solvents. Among the construction designs of photocatalysts, Z-scheme photocatalytic construction with the introduction of a solid-state electron mediator (noble metal components: Pt, Au, and Ag) is considered a practical design to improve the visible-light absorption ability, effective electron–hole separation, and accelerated charge transfer at the interface.19
Heating with microwave has been employed widely in materials synthesis as an alternative to conventional heating because it is an efficient, rapid, and controllable method.20,21 Moreover, microwave heating is dependent on the dielectric properties of solvents. The use of water as a solvent in the reaction has several advantages, such as improved reactivity and selectivity, mild reaction conditions, and simplified workflow. On the other hand, using other solvents leads to toxicity risks, environmental pollution, and waste treatment problems.20 In addition, microwave-assisted synthesis under atmospheric pressure was successfully carried out in the previous work.22
Therefore, a Z-scheme quaternary heterojunction photocatalyst Ag/AgBr@BiOBr/Bi2O3 was prepared in this study using a low-temperature rapid microwave-assisted one-step hydrothermal method. Several characterization methods were employed to confirm the formation of the heterojunction catalysts. Different types of light sources were used to examine the photocatalytic activities of the as-synthesized catalyst under visible light, including a halogen lamp (in the overhead projector (OHP)), light-emitting diodes (LEDs), and a xenon lamp in a solar simulator. Three hard-to-destroy pollutants such as TCH, MO, and RhB were tested. Additionally, the excellent photocatalytic activity and the synergistic effects of the four components of the prepared catalyst were studied. The mechanism of pollutant degradation under visible light has also been discussed.
2. Experimental
2.1 Materials
Bismuth(III) nitrate pentahydrate (Bi(NO3)3·5H2O, ≥98%, Sigma Aldrich), hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide ([(C16H33)N(CH3)3]Br, CTAB, 98%, Alfa Aesar), nitric acid (HNO3 70%, Daejung Chemicals), and silver nitrate (AgNO3, ≥99.8%, Daejung Chemicals) were used to synthesize the photocatalyst. RhB (90%, Sigma Aldrich), MO (Junsei Chemicals), and TCH (C22H24N2O8·HCl, 96%, Alfa Aesar) were used as the target organic pollutants without further purification. Sodium hydrogen carbonate (NaHCO3, >99%, Daejung Chemicals), tert-butyl alcohol (TBA, ≥99.5%, Daejung Chemicals), p-benzoquinone (p-BZQ, 98%, Sigma Aldrich), and L-histidine (≥99%, Sigma Aldrich) were used as received.
2.2 Synthesis of Ag/AgBr@BiOBr/Bi2O3
The Ag/AgBr@BiOBr/Bi2O3 nanocomposite was synthesized using a microwave-assisted one-step approach. Typically, 0.075 g of CTAB was dissolved in 50 ml of DI water to obtain a transparent solution. Subsequently, 100 μl of 70% HNO3 was added to the solution. Then, 0.2 g of Bi(NO3)3·5H2O was sonicated in the above solution in a sonication bath for 5 min at room temperature to obtain a milky suspension. The solutions of AgNO3 (0.1 M) were prepared separately. A particular volume of 0.1 M AgNO3 solution was dropped into the milky mixture and stirred for 30 min. The mixture was poured into a microwave reactor. The reaction was conducted at 180 W at 90 °C for 30 min with constant stirring (2.45 GHz microwave, CEM, Discover System) (Scheme 1). After rapid cooling to room temperature, the final product was filtered and washed several times with DI water and dried overnight in a vacuum oven at 40 °C. The experiments were carried out with different amounts of 0.1 M AgNO3 solutions (100, 300, 500, 700, and 1000 μl denoted as S1, S3, S5, S7, and S10, respectively). A BiOBr/Bi2O3 sample was synthesized using the same procedure without adding the AgNO3 solution for comparison purposes. A pure AgBr sample was synthesized by a reaction between 0.1 M AgNO3 and KBr (molar ratio of 1:1) at room temperature.

2.3 Characterization
The crystallinity of the samples was analyzed by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD, PANalytical, X'Pert-PRO MPD) using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.154 nm). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi, S-4800) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Philips, CM-200) were used to observe the morphology of the samples. The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images were collected using a TITAN G2 ChemiSTEM Cs probe electron microscope. The elemental composition and chemical state were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Kratos, AXIS Nova) using monochromatized Al Kα radiation. A HORIBA scientific photoluminescence spectrometer (PL, HORIBA, iHR550) with a laser wavelength excitation of 325 nm was used to record the photoluminescence (PL) spectra.
The UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra and UV-vis spectra of the samples were collected using a Varian Cary 5000 UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer. Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) was carried out at room temperature by time-resolved confocal fluorescence microscopy (MicroTime-200, Picoquant) with a pulsed single-mode diode laser (375 nm with a pulse width of 30 ps and an average power of approximately 5 μW) as the excitation source. The total organic carbon (TOC) was measured using a TOC analyzer (multi N/C 2100S, Analytic Jena). The electron spin resonance (ESR) was also measured using an ESR spectrometer (EMX plus-9.5/2.7, Bruker). An exponential fit for the emission decays was accomplished using Symphotime-64 software (ver. 2.2).
2.4 Photocatalytic degradation of dyes
The photocatalytic activity of the catalysts was evaluated by pollutant degradation using a solar simulator (ABET Technologies, LS 150, 150 W Xe arc lamp) with one sun illumination, an overhead projector (OHP 400 W, Liesegang Trainer Deluxe 400, halogen lamp), and a light-emitting diode (LED) lamp (6 ea ×0.4 W) as the visible light sources. TCH, MO, and RhB with absorbance at λ = 357, 465, and 553 nm, respectively, were used as the model contaminants in wastewater to determine the photodecomposition efficiency of the catalyst, η (%), which is defined as: (1)where C0 is the initial concentration of the pollutant and C is the concentration of the pollutant after degradation. The reactions were controlled in a photochemical reactor at room temperature. In a typical run, a certain photocatalyst was added to 50 ml of a 10 mg L−1 aqueous pollutant solution, resulting in a photocatalyst loading of 0.5 g L−1. The reaction mixture was stirred in the dark chamber for 30 min to ensure the adsorption–desorption equilibrium before irradiation. A 3 ml aliquot was withdrawn at a given light-irradiation time and then centrifuged at 10000 rpm for 5 min to separate the catalyst. The residual pollutant concentrations were monitored spectrophotometrically by measuring the absorbance of the TCH, MO, and RhB solutions. The reusability of the photocatalyst was evaluated by the photocatalytic degradation of 10 mg L−1 MO solution. After each cycle, the catalyst was collected, washed with DI water, and dried in a vacuum oven at 40 °C before the next cycle. After the 9th cycle, the surface morphology and structure of the used catalyst were examined. Trapping or scavenging reagents were added to the dye solutions before visible light irradiation to understand the photocatalytic mechanism and identify the main active oxidizing species in the photodegradation process; 0.2 M TBA, 0.2 M NaHCO3, 0.2 M L-histidine, and 1 mM p-BZQ were used as the scavengers for the hydroxyl radicals, holes, singlet oxygen, and superoxide radicals, respectively.
2.5 Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements and photocurrent response measurement
EIS of samples was performed using an Autolab PGSTAT 302 N (Metrohm) instrument equipped with a conventional three-electrode cell system. The Ag/AgCl electrode, Pt electrode, and working electrode (coated with the as-prepared catalyst) were set up in a quartz cell in the presence of 0.5 M Na2SO4 electrolyte. The working electrode was prepared using the drop-casting technique by depositing the active material on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass (1 cm × 1 cm active area). Briefly, 2 mg of the as-prepared catalyst was mixed with 1 ml of ethanol and 10 μl of Nafion to obtain a slurry. Subsequently, 15 μl of this mixture was drop-cast onto an FTO glass substrate and dried in a vacuum oven for 12 h. The EIS spectra of the samples were recorded over the frequency range, 0.01 to 105 Hz.
The photocurrent response of samples was also measured at 0.5 V using the same instrument. The photocurrent response was measured under several on/off irradiation cycles for 20 seconds using a solar simulator as the light source. The working electrodes had the same illuminated area of 1 cm × 1 cm.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Characterization
XRD characterized the phase of the as-prepared samples. As shown in Fig. 1, the XRD pattern of Ag/AgBr@BiOBr/Bi2O3 shows peaks for the BiOBr, Bi2O3, AgBr, and Ag components in the nanocomposites. The BiOBr component showed characteristic peaks at 11.0°, 25.2°, 32.1°, 39.4°, 46.4°, 50.7°, 57.3°, and 77.0° 2θ (JCPDS #01-1004). The peaks at 25.2°, 32.1°, 46.4°, and 57.3° 2θ corresponding to the (011), (110), (020), and (212) planes confirmed the presence of the tetragonal structure of BiOBr (Fig. 1a).8,23,24 XRD peaks also confirmed the presence of AgBr at 26.7, 31.0, 44.3, 55.1, and 73.3° 2θ corresponding to the (111), (200), (220), (222), and (420) planes, respectively. These peaks were indexed to the JCPDS #06-0438 profile, which belongs to the cubic structure of AgBr (Fig. 1a and c). Moreover, the nanocomposite showed Ag peaks with weak signals at 38.0° and 64.7° 2θ for the (111) and (220) planes (JCPDS #01-1164) and cubic phase Bi2O3 at 32.3°, 67.7°, and 77.0° 2θ corresponding to the (200), (400), and (420) planes (JCPDS #52-1007), respectively (Fig. 1a). The presence of Ag and Bi2O3 was difficult to confirm because the amounts were lower than the detection limit for XRD.16 Moreover, previous studies showed that the highly crystallized cubic phase of Bi2O3 is challenging to obtain at low temperatures without further annealing.25,26 For comparison, the XRD pattern of the BiOBr/Bi2O3 sample synthesized from the same procedure without adding AgNO3 solution showed no XRD peaks for Ag and AgBr (Fig. 1b), while the intense peaks of pure AgBr showed high crystallinity matching the JCPDS #06-0438 profile (Fig. 1c). The XRD patterns of pure BiOBr and Bi2O3 are shown in Fig. S1.†

The BET surface area, pore-volume, and pore size of the Ag/AgBr@BiOBr/Bi2O3 catalyst were measured using the N2 adsorption–desorption experiment. A type III isotherm with an H3-hysteresis loop was obtained and is reported in Fig. S2.† The surface area, pore-volume, and pore size were 8.15 m2 g−1, 0.042 cm3 g−1, and 3.14 nm, respectively. The chemical structures of BiOBr, BiOBr/Bi2O3, Ag/AgBr, and Ag/AgBr@BiOBr/Bi2O3 composites were analyzed using FTIR-ATR and are presented in Fig. S3.† The central BiOBr peak was 600–1000 cm−1, representing the stretching vibration of the Bi–O bond. For BiOBr/Bi2O3 composite, the peak shape changed significantly, showing the fractional conversion of BiOBr to BiOBr/Bi2O3. The new bands at 810, 1035, 1300, and 1365 cm−1 correspond to the new vibration modes resulting from the Bi–O bond in Bi2O3. Finally, the Ag/AgBr@BiOBr/Bi2O3 composite shows the same absorption bands as BiOBr/Bi2O3 as Ag/AgBr spectra show only broad bands.
SEM and TEM characterizations were employed to study the morphology of the as-prepared catalysts further, as shown in Fig. 2. The nanosheet structure of the BiOBr/Bi2O3 sample showed a size range from 1 to 1.5 μm (Fig. 2a and b). The same structure was also observed in the Ag/AgBr@BiOBr/Bi2O3 sample, but Ag and AgBr particles were observed on the BiOBr/Bi2O3 nanosheets (Fig. 2c and d). Closer observation showed that the BiOBr/Bi2O3 and Ag/AgBr@BiOBr/Bi2O3 composites consisted of the nanosheets of BiOBr/Bi2O3. Furthermore, the TEM image (Fig. 2d) indicated a uniform distribution of Ag and AgBr particles on the surface and edges of the nanosheets. As shown in Fig. 3a, the small Ag particles of approximately 10 nm were anchored uniformly on the BiOBr/Bi2O3 nanosheets, while the AgBr particles with the largest size of approximately 100 nm were distributed randomly over the surface of the nanosheets. From the HR-TEM images (Fig. 3b–e) of the Ag/AgBr@BiOBr/Bi2O3 sample, the lattice fringes of the components in the composites were observed. The lattice fringe with an interplanar spacing of approximately 0.28 nm was correlated with the (110) plane of the BiOBr component (Fig. 3e), which is in accord with the dominant diffraction peak of BiOBr in the XRD pattern. The lattice fringe spacing of 0.29 nm corresponds to the (200) plane of AgBr, as shown in Fig. 3d and e. The lattice fringes with interplanar spacings corresponding to the (111) planes of Ag and Bi2O3 phases were also found with 0.23 and 0.30 nm, respectively (Fig. 3c and e), revealing the formation of Ag and Bi2O3 components in the composites. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of the nanocomposite with bright dots confirmed the high level of crystallinity in the structure (Fig. 3f). EDS provided information on element contents of the nanocomposite in which the Ag element content was about 1.0 wt%.

Overall, the formative pathway of the catalyst is expressed in the following equations.27 Bi3+ + 3NO3− + H2O ↔ BiONO3 + 2H+ + 2NO3−(2) BiONO3 ↔ BiO+ + NO3−(3) BiO+ + Br− → BiOBr(4) AgNO3 → Ag+ + NO3−(5) Ag+ + Br− → AgBr(6) Ag+ + e− → Ag(7) BiONO3 + H2O ↔ Bi2O2(OH)NO3 + 2H+ + NO3–(8) Bi2O2(OH)NO3 + OH− → Bi2O3 + 3NO3− + H2O(9)
Because of the strong-acid weak-base salt, the Bi(NO3)3·5H2O reagent would be hydrolyzed to BiONO3 in the acidic media (eqn (2)). The BiONO3 species were then hydrolyzed to BiO+ according to eqn (3). In this reaction, CTAB acts as a bromide source for the formation of BiOBr and AgBr. As a result, the generated BiO+ species reacted rapidly with Br− to form BiOBr with a nanosheet structure (eqn (4)). The same reaction would occur with Ag+ to produce AgBr (eqn (5) and (6)). CTAB is also a reducing agent that can produce electrons under microwave conditions to form Ag species on the surface of the BiOBr nanosheets (eqn (7)). Ultimately, while contributing to the production of BiOBr, BiONO3 would participate simultaneously in two reactions to form Bi2O3 (eqn (8) and (9)). The formation of Ag and Bi2O3 cannot be avoided under the microwave environment for the short-time reaction. On the other hand, Ag and Bi2O3 contributed to the separation of electron–hole pairs in the photocatalytic system, resulting in excellent photocatalytic activity under visible light.
The surface elemental composition and chemical state of the Ag/AgBr@BiOBr/Bi2O3 sample were investigated by XPS, as shown in Fig. 4. The XPS survey spectrum indicates the presence of Ag, Bi, Br, and O in the nanocomposite (Fig. 4a). The two deconvoluted Ag 3d peaks at 372.9 and 366.9 eV in Fig. 4b are assigned to Ag 3d3/2 and Ag 3d5/2, respectively, which exist in AgBr.28 Two small peaks at 374.1 and 368.2 eV are assigned to metallic Ag0 split into the Ag 3d3/2 and Ag 3d5/2 region, respectively, indicating the formation of a small amount of Ag metal (<5%). As observed in Fig. 4c, the high-resolution XPS spectrum of Bi 4f consists of two peaks centered at 158.4 eV and 163.7 eV. These peaks were attributed to Bi 4f7/2 and Bi 4f5/2, respectively, which confirmed the presence of the Bi3+ state in BiOBr and Bi2O3 species in the nanocomposite.9,10,29,30 In Fig. 4c, the XPS spectrum of Br 3d was deconvoluted into two prominent peaks. The peaks at 67.4 eV and 68.4 eV corresponding to Br 3d5/2 and Br 3d3/2, respectively, showed the existence of Br− with a valence of −1 in AgBr and BiOBr (Fig. 4d).18,31 The O 1s peak could be deconvoluted into two peaks related to oxygen in the nanocomposite (Fig. 4e). The peak at 529.1 eV was assigned to lattice oxygen in Bi–O–Bi,10,32 whereas the peak at 530.7 eV was attributed to O2− anions in BiOBr.17 These results are consistent with those from the XRD data and confirm the successful formation of Ag/AgBr@BiOBr/Bi2O3 nanocomposites.

3.2 Opto-electrochemical properties
The light absorption property is one of the critical properties of a photocatalyst because it affects photocatalytic performance. Therefore, the light absorption of the as-prepared samples was measured using a UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer in the range of 200 to 800 nm, as shown in Fig. 5a. The Ag/AgBr@BiOBr/Bi2O3 sample recorded a red-shift in the absorption edge and strong absorbance at a wide range of wavelengths from 200 to 800 nm compared to the BiOBr and BiOBr/Bi2O3 samples. Ag and AgBr enhanced the light absorption ability of the Ag-containing-catalyst due to the contribution from the SPR phenomena of Ag and the visible-light absorption of AgBr.11,13,33 This behavior would allow the composite to harvest light effectively over broad wavelengths for photocatalytic reactions. Furthermore, the BiOBr/Bi2O3 sample showed no response to visible light due to the effect of the Bi2O3 content,13 but its light absorption was more substantial at wavelengths below 400 nm than BiOBr. Although the AgBr sample exhibited the most prominent absorbance from 400 to 800 nm, its photocatalytic activity during the degradation process was poor, corroborated by the ineffective separation of the photogenerated electron–hole pairs. Moreover, the UV-vis absorption spectrum can be used to estimate the optical bandgap of the nanocomposite by plots of (αhν)1/2vs. hν based on the expression of the Tauc plot.27,30

Herein, hν is the photon energy (eV), α is the absorption coefficient, A is a proportionality constant, and Eg is the bandgap (eV). Fig. 5b presents the Tauc plots of AgBr, BiOBr, Bi2O3, BiOBr/Bi2O3, and Ag/AgBr@BiOBr/Bi2O3, where the bandgaps are determined by the slopes of the tangents on the horizontal axis to approximately 2.34, 2.72, 2.80, 2.71, and 2.65 eV, respectively. The conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB) edge positions of BiOBr, Bi2O3, and AgBr semiconductors can be calculated to be +0.31, +0.34, and −1.25 eV for ECB and +3.03, +3.14, and +1.09 eV for EVB, respectively (ESI† S3).
The photoluminescence (PL) spectrum at a laser wavelength excitation of 325 nm is an effective technique for evaluating the rate of photogenerated electron–hole pair recombination in nanocomposites.16 Basically, an increase in the PL intensity represents the higher recombination rate of charge carriers.1Fig. 5c shows the room-temperature PL spectra of the as-prepared samples. The emission intensity of the AgBr sample showed the highest intensity compared to the other samples, indicating the high recombination rate of electrons and holes. While the BiOBr/Bi2O3 sample showed a weaker emission intensity than the BiOBr sample, the co-existence of Ag and AgBr on the BiOBr/Bi2O3 produced the lowest emission intensity. This behavior was attributed to the effective separation of charge carriers by incorporation of Ag and AgBr particles on the surface of BiOBr/Bi2O3. The Ag particles generate electrons due to the SPR effect and act as a solid-state electron mediator in the catalytic system,16,19 providing many electrons and facilitating rapid electron transfer between BiOBr/Bi2O3 and AgBr. This rapid migration of charges significantly decreases the recombination rate of electron–hole pairs, which further results in excellent photocatalytic activity under visible light irradiation.
EIS and photocurrent response measurements were implemented to prove the separation and transport of electrons and holes and provide a better understanding of the transport of charge carriers. In the Nyquist plots, the semicircle at the high frequency represents the interfacial charge transfer property at the electrode/electrolyte interface and is related to the charge transfer resistance.34 The smaller arches indicate lower charge transfer resistance. The relative arch sizes of the as-prepared samples were identified in the following order (Fig. 5d): AgBr > BiOBr > BiOBr/Bi2O3 > Ag/AgBr@BiOBr/Bi2O3, verifying that the constructed heterojunctions of Ag, AgBr, and BiOBr/Bi2O3 have low charge transfer resistance due to the rapid charge transport and effective charge separation at the interface of the catalyst.34,35 These results confirm that many photogenerated electrons and holes with longer lifetimes were photogenerated. This formation initiated the generation of oxidizing agents for the photocatalytic reactions that degraded the contaminants on the catalyst surface. The photocurrent response measurement was examined at a fixed bias of 0.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl with successive 20 s on/off cycles of solar light irradiation to acquire more information on the kinetic process of separation and transportability of these photoinduced electron–hole pairs. The photo-excited electrons generated from semiconductors (BiOBr, Bi2O3, and AgBr) under solar light irradiation would implement electron migration to the FTO substrate to produce photocurrents.1,36 A higher generated photocurrent density represents faster charge transport and higher separation efficiency of photoinduced electron–hole pairs. The AgBr sample showed the lowest photocurrent density of 0.71 μA cm−2 (Fig. 5e). Although AgBr showed outstanding absorbance in the visible range, the rapid recombination of electrons and holes in the AgBr catalyst resulted in a weak photocurrent response, leading to poor photocatalytic activity. Furthermore, the photocurrent densities of the BiOBr and BiOBr/Bi2O3 samples were 1.30 and 1.81 μA cm−2, respectively, showing the interaction between the two components (BiOBr and Bi2O3) resulted in better charge carrier separation than BiOBr.1,3,34 The strong charge separation ability in the Ag/AgBr@BiOBr/Bi2O3 sample was recorded with the highest photocurrent density of 2.10 μA cm−2. Therefore, this proves that the synergistic interaction among the components contributed considerably to the high separation efficiency and longer lifetime of the photoinduced electrons and holes. These results show that integration between Ag, AgBr, and BiOBr/Bi2O3 formed the multichannel transport for photoinduced electrons and holes, resulting in highly efficient photocatalytic activity.
The kinetics of photoinduced electrons and holes of photocatalysts was investigated by time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) on AgBr, BiOBr, BiOBr/Bi2O3, and Ag/AgBr@BiOBr/Bi2O3 samples at room temperature. The multiexponential decay curves were fitted by a multicomponent decay kinetics function using the following equation:37 I(t) = A1·exp(−t/τ1) + A2·exp(−t/τ2) + ⋯ + An·exp(−t/τn)(10)where I(t) is the time-resolved PL intensity, τi is the individual lifetime, and Ai is the corresponding amplitude in a normalized percentage (%). Fig. 6 shows the fitted TRPL curves of the samples. Table S1† lists the best-fitted values for calculating the average lifetime of the charge carriers for each sample. The average lifetime (τA) of the charge carriers were determined using eqn (11): (11)The τA values for the Ag/AgBr@BiOBr/Bi2O3, BiOBr/Bi2O3, and AgBr samples were 16.75, 14.76, and 0.69 ns, respectively. The τA values of the Ag/AgBr@BiOBr/Bi2O3 sample were approximately 1.13 and 24.3 times longer than those of the BiOBr/Bi2O3 and AgBr samples, respectively, indicating that the combination of Ag/AgBr and BiOBr/Bi2O3 improves the electron–hole separation efficiency through the Z-scheme mechanism. This separation prolongs the charge lifetime on the catalyst surface, resulting in the Ag/AgBr@BiOBr/Bi2O3 sample having the highest photocatalytic activity.

3.3 Photocatalytic activity test
To confirm the above results, the photodegradation under a solar simulator at room temperature demonstrates the photocatalytic activities of the as-prepared nanocomposites. As shown in Fig. 7, the TCH degradation experiments were carried out at λ = 357 nm to compare the photocatalytic activities of the as-prepared samples. A series of photocatalytic degradation experiments on the S1, S3, S5, S7, and S10 photocatalysts were conducted under identical conditions (catalyst loading of 0.5 g L−1, 50 ml of 10 mg L−1 TCH solution, room temperature) to determine the optimal volume of the 0.1 M AgNO3 solution to synthesize the best photocatalyst. Fig. S4† suggested that the optimal volume of the 0.1 M AgNO3 solution was 300 μl (denoted as sample S3) with the highest TCH degradation efficiency of 98.6% for 60 min, which exhibited as the best photocatalyst in the test. The time-dependent UV-vis absorption spectra of the 10 mg L−1 TCH solution in the presence of the Ag/AgBr@BiOBr/Bi2O3 photocatalyst (sample S3) were recorded to determine the change in TCH concentration as a function of the irradiation time, as shown Fig. 7a. When the volume of 0.1 M AgNO3 solution was increased to 1 ml for the synthesis of the sample S10, the TCH removal efficiency decreased to 89.0%. This suggests that an increase in Ag/AgBr contents on the surface of BiOBr/Bi2O3 nanosheets has negative effects on the degradation of TCH because an excessive loading of Ag and AgBr prevents the BiOBr/Bi2O3 from harvesting light. On the other hand, the degradation efficiency in the BiOBr/Bi2O3 sample was only 90.8% in the absence of Ag and AgBr (Fig. 7b). Moreover, the pristine AgBr and BiOBr samples showed weak photocatalytic activity under solar light with 78.7 and 87.0% TCH degradation efficiency, respectively. The TCH blank test indicated chemical stability with a slight decrease (7.8%) in concentration for 60 min due to the TCH oxidation process by positive holes generated from the photoexcitation of the TCH molecule under solar light.38

Fig. 7c and d present the rate constants (k) for the degradation reaction of TCH in the presence of different photocatalysts, which increased in the following order: AgBr (k = 0.007 min−1) < BiOBr (k = 0.015 min−1) < BiOBr/Bi2O3 (k = 0.024 min−1) < Ag/AgBr@BiOBr/Bi2O3 (k = 0.034 min−1). These results consistently reflected the results obtained from the opto-electrochemical property measurements of the as-prepared samples. Ultimately, the Z-scheme construction of Ag (electron mediator), AgBr, and BiOBr/Bi2O3 components are favorable for effective light utilization, high separation efficiency, and rapid migration of photoinduced electrons and holes, which results in the remarkable removal of contaminants under visible light. Generally, the photocatalytic activity of the sample depends strongly on the type of pollutant, dye concentration, catalyst loading, pH, and operating temperature. The catalytic efficiency of the photocatalysts was investigated by measuring the adsorption of pollutants at room temperature through the adsorption–desorption equilibrium between the catalyst and contaminant (Fig. S5†). As shown in the graph, the three pollutants adsorbed rapidly on the catalyst surface within 10 min, evidenced by the sharp decrease in concentration due to the great availability of active sites.39 The strongest adsorption of the catalyst was recorded for MO dye at 60%. In contrast, only 8.9% TCH and 49.6% RhB were adsorbed on the catalyst after 10 min in the dark chamber. The Ag/AgBr@BiOBr/Bi2O3 catalyst reached the adsorption equilibrium for MO in a short time, reflecting the rapid adsorption kinetics.39 Moreover, the concentration of pollutants showed almost no significant change within the next 50 min in the dark, proving that photocatalytic degradation reactions could not occur in the absence of light.
The effects of the three different pollutant types (TCH, RhB, and MO with initial pollutant concentrations of 10 mg L−1) were examined under LED and OHP light as the visible light sources (Fig. 8a and b). TCH, RhB, and MO show excellent chemical stability with no apparent difference in concentration under LED light, whereas a decrease from 0.4 to 6% within 60 min was observed under OHP light in the absence of a catalyst due to the strong self-degradation, as shown in Fig. 8a and b. On the other hand, when the catalyst was exposed to LED light, 68.3% of TCH, 74.4% of MO, and 98.0% of RhB were degraded within 180 min (Fig. 8a). In contrast, the removal efficiencies of TCH, MO, and RhB were 93.7, 96.6, and approximately 100%, respectively, under OHP light in 60 min (Fig. 8b). These results show that the TCH antibiotic contaminant is more difficult to degrade than the dye pollutants (MO and RhB). Moreover, the photodegradation efficiency depends strongly on the light intensity, which is related to the power of the light source.40 As shown Fig. 8c, the degradation efficiency of 10 mg L−1 TCH after 60 min irradiation was 93.7% for OHP light, 90.1% for a solar simulator, and 53.4% for LED light. Since the OHP light gives the highest degradation efficiency, further measurements were carried out under OHP light. Fig. 8d illustrates an experimental setup for MO degradation under OHP light at room temperature.

The effects of the dye concentration, catalyst loading, pH, and operating temperature on the photodegradation efficiency were investigated, as shown in Fig. 9. In this case, MO with different concentrations (10, 15, and 20 mg L−1) in the presence of 0.5 g L−1 of catalyst was used to examine the effect of concentration on the removal efficiency at room temperature.
 Fig. 9  Effect of the MO concentration (catalyst loading of 0.5 g L−1) (a), catalyst loading (10 mg L−1 MO) (b), pH of RhB solution (catalyst loading of 0.3 g L−1, 10 mg L−1 RhB) (c), and operating temperature (catalyst loading of 0.3 g L−1, 10 mg L−1 RhB) (d) on the degradation efficiency under OHP light. 
As shown in Fig. 9a, while approximately 100% of 10 mg L−1 MO was removed within 60 min, the degradation efficiency decreased to 94.1% when the initial MO concentration doubled to 20 mg L−1. The degradation efficiency was 98.3% with 15 mg L−1 MO after 60 min under OHP light irradiation. An increase in concentration had filtering effects that interfered with the light reaching the catalyst surface, suppressing the degradation efficiency.1,41 Moreover, the degradation efficiency was proportional to the increase in catalyst loading (0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.5 g L−1) (Fig. 9b). After 60 min under OHP light irradiation, the degradation efficiencies were 57.1, 78.1, and 96.7% for catalyst loadings of 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3 g L−1, respectively, while approximately 100% of MO was degraded in 50 min with a catalyst loading of 0.5 g L−1. Therefore, an increase in catalyst dosage must have provided a large number of active sites for the photodegradation process.
In a study of the effect of pH, the RhB solution was used to examine the photocatalytic activity of the catalyst (0.3 g L−1). The pH increase of the RhB solution from 6 to 8 was caused by the decomposition of RhB on the catalyst. The decomposition efficiency at pH = 6 and 8 was 91.3% and 82.3%, respectively, after 30 min irradiation, as shown in Fig. 9c. The formation of the OH− layer might have prevented the RhB molecule from reaching the catalyst on the catalyst surface. On the other hand, the degradation efficiency of RhB reached 99.9% within 20 min when the pH was reduced to 2. The removal efficiency at pH = 4 was 98.9% within 30 min. The higher removal efficiency can be attributed to an increase in [H+] in the medium, which provides H+ species for reactions with superoxide radicals to produce oxidizing agents,  and 1O2,42 leading to an increase in degradation efficiency. One of the operating factors influencing the decomposition efficiency of the pollutant was temperature. The catalyst performance (0.3 g L−1) in 10 mg L−1 RhB degradation was examined at various temperatures (25, 35, and 45 °C), as shown in Fig. 9d. The photocatalytic decomposition kinetics of RhB at various temperatures followed the pseudo-first-order reaction model with high regression coefficients (R2), as shown in Table S2.† The degradation rate constants k increased from 0.073 to 0.146 min−1 as the temperature was increased from 25 to 45 °C (Table S2†). This increase suggests that the degradation was an endothermic process in which an increase in temperature could accelerate the photocatalytic reactions. Based on the Arrhenius equation, the activation energy (Ea) of the reaction was estimated to be 27.5 kJ mol−1 by plotting ln(k) vs. 1/Tk (Fig. 9d).43,44
These results suggest that the type of contaminant, concentration, pH, operating temperature, and catalyst loading have considerable effects on the degradation efficiency of the catalysts. Fig. S4† showed the photodegradation of a 10 mg L−1 aqueous TCH solution on the Ag/AgBr@BiOBr/Bi2O3 catalysts (S1, S3, S5, S7, and S10, synthesized using 100, 300, 500, 700, and 1000 μL of 0.1 M AgNO3 solution, respectively). The adsorption kinetics of the Ag/AgBr@BiOBr/Bi2O3 sample with three different pollutants in the dark was studied (Fig. S5†). The photocatalytic activity of the catalyst was summarized and compared with other studies, as shown in Fig. S6 and Table S3.† A performance index, I, is proposed to compare the photocatalytic activities using the following equation: (12)where η is the degradation efficiency (%), w is the catalyst loading (g L−1), td is the degradation time (min), and Pl is the power of the lamp (W). A higher index indicates a better catalytic performance. The performance indices of the catalyst synthesized in this study are 7561.7, 134.2, and 219.1 for RhB, MO, and TCH, respectively, while the literature showed 815.8, 38.7, and 215.6, respectively. These results present that the catalyst developed in this study has superior photocatalytic activities for degrading RhB, MO, and TCH compared to the literature. The mineralization of TCH was achieved using the Ag/AgBr@BiOBr/Bi2O3 photocatalyst under visible light irradiation. The degree of mineralization was measured with time by TOC. The mineralization efficiency reached 61.7% after 5 h (Fig. S7†), indicating the new photocatalyst's superior TECH mineralization potential.
3.4 Photocatalytic reaction mechanism
The main oxidizing agents involved in the photodegradation process and the catalytic reaction mechanism were investigated by radical-trapping experiments using various scavenging reagents. The oxidizing species were identified from the photocatalytic reactions under identical conditions in the presence of sodium hydrogen carbonate (NaHCO3), tert-butyl alcohol (TBA), p-benzoquinone (p-BZQ), and L-histidine as scavengers for the holes (hVB+), hydroxyl radicals (˙OH), superoxide radicals () and singlet oxygen (1O2), respectively.1,28,45,46
The trapping experiments disclosed the roles of each oxidizing agent (hVB+, ˙OH, , and 1O2) in the photocatalytic degradation (Fig. 10a), evidenced by lower degradation efficiency with the introduction of scavengers in the reactions. In particular, a significant decline in RhB degradation efficiency to approximately 7.9, 35.6, and 69.5% was observed after 60 min under OHP light irradiation after adding L-histidine, NaHCO3, and p-BZQ, respectively. In contrast, the degradation efficiency was 99.1% within 30 min, and complete decomposition occurred after 60 min with the addition of TBA, which was similar to that observed in the absence of scavengers (control experiment). The results showed that singlet oxygen (1O2) plays a significant role as a dominating oxidizing agent while ˙OH species do not contribute to the photocatalytic decomposition in this system. On the other hand, hVB+ and  radicals contribute to pollutant degradation.
 Fig. 10  Degradation curve for RhB (10 mg L−1) under OHP light in the presence of different scavengers (a); and EPR spectra for the degradation of RhB (10 mg L−1) under solar light (b), the effect of different inorganic ions (30 mM) during the degradation of RhB (10 ppm) under solar light (c), and photocatalytic stability under OHP light (d), all for MO dye (10 mg L−1). 
To confirm the existence of singlet oxygen (1O2) and superoxide radicals (), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy was conducted, and the typical signals of both radicals appeared under visible light irradiation (Fig. 10b). 5,5-Dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO) and 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxyl (TEMPO) were used to capture 1O2 and . The peak intensity of TEMPO–1O2 is seen higher than that of DMPO–˙O2−, indicating that singlet oxygen has more contribution to the photocatalytic reaction than superoxide radicals. Based on the above results, the proposed mechanism for the photodegradation reaction of pollutants over the as-prepared nanocomposite is described in the following reactions (see also Scheme 2): (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) hCB+(BiOBr) + H2O → H+ + ˙OH(18) hVB+(Bi2O3) + H2O → H+ + ˙OH(19) (20) (21) (22) (23) (24)
 Scheme 2  Mechanism of the photodegradation and illustration of the charge transfer of the photogenerated electrons and holes under visible light in the presence of the Ag/AgBr@BiOBr/Bi2O3 catalyst. 
Real wastewaters usually contain considerable amounts of inorganic anions and cations such as nitrate, chloride, sulfate, ammonium, and bicarbonate. These ions can change the wastewater's ionic strength (IS) and influence photocatalytic activity. Fig. 10c shows the degradation efficiency of these ions (30 mM). For Ag/AgBr@BiOBr/Bi2O3, the RhB (10 mg L−1) degradation efficiency was over 99% for all ions, and the differences are minor, regardless of ionic strength. This confirms that the new catalyst is suitable for treating waste materials efficiently, even in the presence of usual anions and cations.
The stability of the catalyst was confirmed by measuring the degradation efficiency of MO several times. The degradation efficiency of MO (10 mg L−1) at the first run with a catalyst loading of 0.5 g L−1 was approximately 100% and remained at approximately 97% after the ninth cycle (Fig. 10d). TEM and XRD of the fresh and used (9 cycles) catalysts revealed no changes in the morphology and crystalline structure after nine cycles (Fig. S8†).

Scheme 2 presents the proposed Z-scheme mechanism of the electron transfer process occurring on the catalyst surface under visible light excitation, which explains the efficient charge carrier separation of the catalytic system. Two typical charge transfer processes, including band-to-band transfer between BiOBr and Bi2O3 and the Z-scheme mechanism transfer between Bi2O3 and AgBr with Ag as an electron mediator, might co-exist. When the catalyst was exposed to light, BiOBr, Bi2O3, and AgBr were excited to generate photoinduced electrons and holes (eqn (13)–(15)). These photogenerated electrons and holes tend to recombine to reach a stable energy state. On the other hand, the charge carrier separation resulting from the two charge transfer processes hindered the recombination and accelerated charge transfer on the nanocomposite surface.
Photogenerated electrons at the CB of BiOBr (ECB = +0.31 eV vs. NHE)17 easily transferred to the CB of Bi2O3 (ECB = +0.34 eV vs. NHE)47 following the band-to-band transfer mechanism while electrons in the CB of Bi2O3 and electrons from plasmon-excited Ag particles (eqn (16)) conducted charge transfer to the VB of AgBr (EVB = +1.09 eV vs. NHE) through the “Ag bridge” via the Z-scheme transfer mechanism, as illustrated in Scheme 2. The Ag particles served as electron mediators, accelerating charge transfer and capturing electrons at the CB of BiOBr and Bi2O3. Therefore, the corrosion of Ag is prevented, and the stability of the catalyst system is maintained.12 The trapping experiments showed that the photoinduced electrons in the CB of AgBr (ECB = −1.25 eV vs. NHE) could reduce the O2 dissolved in the aqueous solution to generate  (eqn (17)) because it is more negative than the standard redox potential of O2/ (E° (O2/) = −0.33 eV vs. NHE).27,48 On the other hand, the electrons accumulated in the CB of BiOBr and Bi2O3 would implement charge migration from the CB of BiOBr to the CB of Bi2O3 to prevent electron–hole recombination. In contrast, the holes in the VB of BiOBr (EVB = +3.03 eV vs. NHE)17 and VB of Bi2O3 (EVB = +3.14 eV vs. NHE)47 might oxidize H2O/OH− to form ˙OH radicals (eqn (18) and (19)) because the standard redox potentials of OH−/˙OH and H2O/˙OH are +2.40 eV vs. NHE and +2.72 eV vs. NHE, respectively,27 and they participate simultaneously in oxidizing the pollutant molecule. The results showed that ˙OH radicals have no apparent influence on the degradation process because these generated ˙OH radicals were consumed by a reaction with  to produce singlet oxygen 1O2 (eqn (20)).42 The oxidizing agent of  partially participated in a series of reactions (eqn (21)–(23)) to generate singlet oxygen 1O2. Furthermore, the holes on the VB of AgBr could not oxidize H2O to generate ˙OH radicals. These main oxidative substances, including 1O2, hVB+, and , were involved in the photocatalytic decomposition of the organic pollutants to CO2, H2O, and intermediates (eqn (24)),42 in which 1O2 was the predominant oxidizing agent in this photocatalytic system. The introduction of Ag in the photocatalytic system promoted the rapid migration of charges in the catalyst system owing to its excellent conductive properties and enhanced visible-light response due to SPR contribution,49 generating more photons absorbed by the catalyst. Therefore, more photogenerated electrons and holes are produced for the degradation of pollutants.15
The Z-scheme mechanism and band-to-band charge transfer were facilitated due to the conjugation of semiconductors (AgBr, BiOBr, and Bi2O3) with Ag species (a sink for photoinduced charges49 and a Z-scheme bridge15). The enhanced charge transfer and rapid electron–hole separation at the semiconductor's interfaces prolonged the lifetime of the charges. This efficient separation provided many free electrons and holes on the catalyst surface to generate highly oxidizing radicals for the photodegradation of contaminants.
In practical applications, the photostability of the catalyst plays a vital role in catalyst selection for wastewater treatment.50 The morphology and phase components before and after recycling were also examined (Fig. S8†). The chemical state of the catalysts was measured by XPS (Fig. S9†) for fresh and 9-cycle-used Ag/AgBr@BiOBr/Bi2O3 catalysts. These data showed no noticeable differences in the crystalline structure and the binding energy between the fresh and used catalysts. The XPS data of the fresh and used samples showed that the catalyst kept all elements (Ag, Bi, Br, and O) at the same proportion after nine cycles (Fig. S9†). The shifts of Ag 3d, Bi 4f, and Br 3d peaks of the used catalyst to the higher binding energy were due to the interaction between the intermediate products and catalyst. The intensity of the oxygen anion peak increased after use because of the water absorption. These data confirm the high stability and long cycle life of the Ag/AgBr@BiOBr/Bi2O3 catalyst. These results highlight the excellent stability of the catalyst under OHP light because of the presence of metallic Ag. Moreover, the rapid charge transfer of the catalyst system inhibited the decomposition of AgBr under visible light.15,16,49 The high degradation efficiency and good photostability of the catalyst highlight promising applications of Z-scheme-based photocatalysts in wastewater treatment.
4. Conclusions
A highly efficient Ag/AgBr@BiOBr/Bi2O3 photocatalyst was synthesized using a rapid one-step microwave approach. The conjugation among the semiconductors BiOBr, Bi2O3, and AgBr with the electron mediator Ag enhanced the light absorption due to the SPR effect. This also facilitated rapid charge transfer and efficient separation of electrons and holes via two charge transfer processes: band-to-band transfer and Z-scheme mechanism. The catalyst showed excellent photocatalytic performance toward the degradation of various pollutants (TCH (93.7%), MO (96.6%), and RhB (100%)) under visible light irradiation (400 W OHP light, pollutant concentration of 10 mg L−1, catalyst loading of 0.3 g L−1, 60 min for reaction time). The radical trapping experiment confirmed that 1O2, hVB+, and  species were involved in the photocatalytic reactions, in which 1O2 played a predominant role in the degradation process. The excellent photostability of the catalyst (97% efficiency removal after nine cycles) highlighted its potential applications in industry. The Z-scheme mechanism has advantages in obtaining high degradation efficiency and good catalyst stability. This catalyst with the Z-scheme mechanism could be a promising photocatalyst to address various environmental pollution issues using diverse visible light sources and has potential for designing materials in the future.

Environmental significance
We have solved the environmental wastewater treatment problem economically using an efficient photocatalyst under visible light. We have synthesized a novel Ag/AgBr@BiOBr/Bi2O3 Z-scheme photocatalyst with the help of CTAB using a microwave-assisted one-step method under mild conditions. This catalyst exhibited exceptional photodegradation efficiency for organic pollutants, such as rhodamine B (100%) and methyl orange (97%), under visible light with small loading (0.3 g L–1) and excellent stability (97% after nine cycles). The degradation efficiency with 0.5 g L–1 loading reached 98% under solar light for difficult-to-degrade tetracycline. We have studied photodegradation theoretically using the TRPL and trapping experiments to confirm the Z-scheme and the predominant role of singlet oxygen in the degradation.
