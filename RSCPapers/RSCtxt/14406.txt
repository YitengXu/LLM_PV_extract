    , Accepted 3rd April 2021First published on 5th April 2021AbstractRegardless of the complexity of the phase diagram of the Cu–Sn–S system, several compositions near the prototypical mohite Cu2SnS3 have arisen as potential non-toxic, earth-abundant and cost-efficient photovoltaic and thermoelectric materials. In this work, we revisited the Cu2+xSn1−xS3 system and discovered a monoclinic (C2) ordered sphalerite derivative member, Cu5Sn2S7. Using a combination of synchrotron diffraction and spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, precession-assisted electron diffraction tomography, Mössbauer spectroscopy, first principles calculations and transport properties measurements, we discuss the structure–thermoelectric properties relationships and clarify the interesting crystal chemistry in this system. The ternary sulfide Cu5Sn2S7 exhibits a degenerate semiconducting behavior with exceptionally high hole mobility originating from the interplay between atomic ordering and charge delocalization.
1. Introduction
Copper tin sulfides (CTS) represent a very attractive class of materials that have been intensively studied for their promising photovoltaic and thermoelectric properties due to the fact that they exhibit decent performances and consist of non-toxic, ecofriendly and earth-abundant elements.1–3 Early studies of the Cu–Sn–S system have discussed the existence of numerous phases: Cu2SnS3, Cu2Sn2S5, Cu5SnS4, Cu2Sn3S7, Cu4SnS4, Cu5Sn2S7, Cu7Sn3S10, Cu4SnS6, Cu3SnS4, Cu9.67Sn2.33S13, Cu10Sn2S13, CuSn3.75S8, Cu2Sn4S9, Cu8SnS6, Cu2Sn3.34S7.6, Cu5SnS6, Cu4Sn3S8, Cu2Sn2S9, Cu8Sn3S12, Cu4Sn7S16.4–15 However, this rich phenomenology has not been greatly exploited in applications mostly because of the limited understanding of the structure–property relationships. The ability to control structural and electronic properties by tuning the Cu/Sn compositional ratio is of paramount importance for achieving efficient thermoelectric (TE) conversion as well as for tuning CTS compositions for thin-film solar cells. Indeed, many copper-tin sulfides have interesting p-type transport properties, making them potential candidates for integration in TE modules. In this respect, the sulfide Cu2SnS3 exhibits competitive TE performances when doped with Zn and Co, leading to figure of merit ZT values of 0.58 and 0.85 at 723 K, respectively.1,16 Note that the conversion efficiency of TE materials is represented by the figure of merit ZT = S2T/ρκ (T being the temperature, S the Seebeck coefficient, ρ the electrical resistivity, and κ the thermal conductivity). From the point of view of photovoltaic (PV) applications, CTS materials provide high absorption coefficient, unique tunability of the electronic band gap from 0.9 to 1.77 eV and were predicted to reach a Shockley–Queisser limit of 30% [see ref. 2 and references therein]. The intrinsic tunability of the functional properties of CTS compounds is due to the complex crystal chemistry, which in most cases, involves a subtle balance of electrostatic interactions and charge delocalization controlled by the position of Sn4+ on the cationic sublattice of corner-sharing tetrahedral network, characterising most of those compounds.
The remarkable polymorphism of Cu2SnS3, which involves three types of symmetry (a high temperature cubic form isotypic with the ZnS structure,6,7 a room temperature tetragonal I2m form,5 and a monoclinic Cc form17), is thought to be due to order-disorder phenomena that significantly influence the electronic transport properties.1,18 However, in a recent study of the thermoelectric properties of Cu2+xSn1−xS3, Deng et al. have shown that, for 0.016 ≤ x ≤ 0.08, the proportion of the three coexisting polymorphs, cubic F3m, tetragonal I2m, and monoclinic Cc, has surprisingly little influence on the electrical transport properties of the material.19 Considering the critical effect on the transport properties caused by the modifications of the conductive network observed in colusites,20–22 we have revisited the Cu2+xSn1−xS3 system. Using a synergy between synthesis, characterization, and first principles calculations, we found that the crystal chemistry critically controls long range ordering phenomena limiting the relative stability of disordered solid solutions. We discovered an ordered phase Cu5Sn2S7 crystallizing with a monoclinic structure described in the space group C2. This phase is isotypic to both Cu4NiSi2S7,23 and to the homologous selenide Cu5Sn2Se7,24 and can be obtained as a pure phase for x = 0.15. Despite the close compositions and common structural sphalerite framework, the new member of the Cu–Sn–S family is immiscible. We also demonstrate that the electronic transport properties of synthetic mohite Cu2SnS3 (x = 0, monoclinic Cc), Cu2.075Sn0.925S3 (x = 0.075), and Cu5Sn2S7 (x = 0.15 in Cu2+xSn1−xS3, monoclinic C2) are different and depend on the interplay between the structure and hole carrier concentration,25 which influences the hybridized 3d(Cu)–3p(S) conductive network.26 The discovery of the monoclinic Cu5Sn2S7 phase adds a high carrier mobility member to the Cu–Sn–S diagram and demonstrates how crystal structure can be advantageously manipulated to design novel compositions for energy-oriented applications.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Materials synthesis
The polycrystalline sample of pristine Cu2SnS3 was synthesized by a two-step solid state reaction in evacuated silica tubes from the elemental precursors (Cu (99%, Alfa Aesar), Sn (99.85%, Alfa Aesar), and S (99.5%, Alfa Aesar)). First, Cu, Sn and S were ground in an agate mortar with the appropriate stoichiometric ratio and compacted into a pellet, sealed in an evacuated silica tube and heated to 1023 K at a rate of 50 K h−1. The pellet was held at that temperature for 48 h followed by a cooling step down to room temperature at a rate of 50 K h−1. Subsequently, the as-prepared Cu2SnS3 sample was crushed and the powder was compacted for a second firing carried out at 873 K for 24 h with an intermediate step at 673 K for 12 h. The same heating and cooling rates of 50 K h−1 were used. The obtained sample was once again ground and sieved down to 200 μm to remove large agglomerates.
Powders of Cu2+xSn1−xS3 (x = 0.075 and 0.15) were synthesized by mechanical-alloying. All sample preparations and handling of powders were performed in an argon filled glovebox with oxygen content <1 ppm. Stoichiometric amounts of high purity elements Cu (99%, Alfa Aesar), Sn (99.85%, Alfa Aesar), and S (99.5%, Alfa Aesar) were loaded in a 25 mL tungsten carbide jar containing 7 balls of 10 mm under argon atmosphere. High-energy ball-milling was performed in a Fritsch Pulverisette 7 Premium line planetary ball-mill operating at room temperature (RT) at a disc rotation speed of 600 rpm for 6 h. The resulting powders were then ground and sieved down to 150 μm.
The pristine (x = 0) and Cu-rich (x = 0.075 and 0.15) powders were then placed in a graphite die of 10 mm diameter and densified by SPS (FCT HPD 25) at 873 K for 30 min under a pressure of 64 MPa. The final dimensions of the pellet are around 8 mm in thickness and 10 mm in diameter. Relative densities are about 96% for x = 0 sample and 91–92% for x = 0.075 and 0.15 samples.
2.2. X-ray diffraction analysis
X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) data were collected at room temperature using a Bruker D8 Advance Vario 1 two-circle diffractometer (θ–2θ Bragg–Brentano mode) using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å) equipped with a Ge(111) monochromator (Johansson type) and a Lynx Eye detector. Synchrotron XRPD data of Cu5Sn2S7 (Cu2.15Sn0.85S3 sample) was collected at room temperature on the endstation CX2 devoted to the high-resolution XRD measurements of MARS (Multi-Analysis On Radioactive Samples) beamline at SOLEIL synchrotron (Saint-Aubin, France). The beamline uses a bending magnet source and the X-rays are monochromatized by a double crystal monochromator (DCM) equipped with a pair of Si(220) crystals. The second crystal is sagittally bent to perform the horizontal beam focusing. Higher harmonics rejection and vertical collimation were achieved using the Pt strip of the two mirrors inserted before and after the DCM with a 3.1 mRad incidence angle. The incident X-ray energy was calibrated using the absorption K-edge of an Y foil (E0 = 17.038 keV) with a beam sizing about 1000 × 300 μm (H × V) at the sample position. The station is equipped by an angular precision two-circle goniometer for the collection of powder diffraction in Debye–Scherrer geometry. High-resolution data was carried out by the use of a set of 24 detectors equipped with crystal analyzer Ge(111).27 Sample was finely ground and inserted in a boron glass capillary of diameter 0.3 mm in order to avoid the necessity to correct the data for absorption. The analysis of the diffraction patterns was performed by Rietveld refinement using the FullProf and WinPlotr software packages.28,29 Background contribution was estimated manually. Zero-point shift, lattice parameters, peak shape parameters and asymmetry parameters were systematically refined, while fractional atomic coordinates and isotropic displacement parameters (i.e. Debye–Waller factors Biso) were refined only for synchrotron XRPD data.
2.3. Mössbauer spectroscopy

119Sn Mössbauer spectra were recorded at room temperature (T = 300 K) in transmission geometry with a spectrometer operated in the conventional constant-acceleration mode. Polycrystalline absorber, with natural abundance of 119Sn isotope and a real density of ∼15 mg cm−2, was used. The source, kept at room temperature, was Ba119SnO3 with a nominal strength of 10 mCi. A palladium foil of 0.5 mm thickness was used as a critical absorber for tin X-rays. Velocity calibration was performed against a 12 mm-thick α-Fe foil at room temperature. 119Sn isomer shifts (IS) are referred to BaSnO3 at room temperature. Mössbauer spectrum was fitted with a least-squares method program assuming Lorentzian peaks.
2.4. Transmission electron microscopy
HAADF-STEM, ED studies, and EDXSTEM were performed on JEM ARM200F cold FEG double aberration-corrected microscope operated at 200 kV and equipped with ORIUS CCD camera, large angle CENTURIO EDX detector, and GIF QUANTUM. TEM specimen was prepared by grinding the material in agate mortar in ethanol and depositing suspension on Ni carbon holey grid.
2.5. Precession-assisted electron diffraction tomography
Precession-assisted electron diffraction tomography (PEDT)30,31 data were obtained using a JEOL F200 (200 kV) transmission electron microscope (TEM) equipped with a Gatan RIO16 camera and a Nanomegas DigiSTAR unit. Samples for TEM investigations were prepared by smoothly crushing powder under ethanol in an agate mortar and depositing drops of the mixture onto a holey carbon membrane supported by a Ni grid. PED patterns were collected on x = 0.15 sample with a precession angle of 1.2° and a tilt step of about 1° between each pattern. PEDT data were processed using the programs PETS 2.032 and Jana 2006.33 Crystallographic details of data reduction and dynamical refinement are given in Tables S1 and S2.†

2.6. EXAFS/XANES
X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) measurements were carried out at room temperature in transmission mode at the K-edge of Cu (8987.96 eV) and Sn (29209.79 eV) at the beamline SAMBA (Spectroscopies Applied to Materials Based on Absorption) at Soleil Synchrotron, France (Proposal 20200538).34 Radiation coming from a bending magnet source was collimated by a first cylindrical bent mirror onto the Si(220) fixed-exit sagittally-focusing double-crystal monochromator. Harmonic rejection has been performed by the use of a second cylindrical bent mirror that also focused vertically the monochromatic beam.
At the sample position, the spot resulted of 300 × 300 μm2. Measurements have been collected during continuous monochromator scans monitoring, incident, and transmitted X-ray flux by opportunely filled Oxford ionization chambers.35 During measurement, a reference sample (a copper or a tin foil) has been simultaneously measured with residual photons of the second ionization chamber for energy calibration. The amount of sample and the thickness of the pellet were optimized in order to have proper XAS signal. The calculated amount of each sample was ground, mixed with cellulose, and then compacted into a pellet. Due to the large difference of X-ray cross section at Sn and Cu K edges, two different samples were prepared for the two energies. The Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS) signal treatment was performed according to standard procedures: substraction of the pre-edge and post-edge backgrounds, edge normalization, extraction of EXAFS signal χ(k) and its Fourier transformation, which provides a map in the real space of the distribution of the distances R around the absorber atom. Demeter software package was used to perform data treatment and fitting.36 The model functions were created based on the crystallographic data atom location. For each edge, all the spectrum has been simultaneously fitted, using a single common edge shift. Such approximation has been possible due the strong resemblance of all the spectra and the convention to use exactly the same E0 during the procedure of EXAFS signal extraction.
X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy (XANES) calculation has been performed in real space with muffin tin approximation by FEFF code using final state rule and Hedin–Lundqvist exchange correlation potential.37 For both edge a 10 Å cluster around the absorber has been used.
2.7. Electrical and thermal properties measurements
The electrical resistivity (ρ) and Seebeck coefficient (S) were measured simultaneously from 2 × 3 × 10 mm3 ingots, from 300 K up to 700 K using an ULVAC-ZEM3 instrument under partial helium pressure. A NETZSCH LFA-457 apparatus was used for measuring the thermal diffusivity under argon flow. The thermal conductivity (κ) was determined as the product of the geometrical density, the thermal diffusivity, and the theoretical heat capacity using the Dulong–Petit approximation. The lattice contribution to the thermal conductivity (κL) was determined by subtracting the estimated electronic component (κe) from the measured total thermal conductivity, κ. The measurement uncertainties are estimated to be 6% for the Seebeck coefficient, 8% for the electrical resistivity, 11% for the thermal conductivity, and 16% for the final dimensionless figure of merit, ZT.38
Hall effect measurements over the temperature range of 5 K to 300 K were carried out using a Physical Properties Measurement System (PPMS; Quantum Design) under an applied magnetic field of 9 T. Electrical resistivity over the temperature range of 5 K to 300 K was also measured with a PPMS.
An initial assessment of the thermal stability and the reproducibility of the thermoelectric properties of Cu5Sn2S7 were carried out through cycling measurements of the electrical transport properties, up to 625 K (Fig. S1†) and 675 K (Fig. S2†). These results show that, up to 625 K, Cu5Sn2S7 remains stable with no systematic variation in the performances, all being within the experimental uncertainty. There are very small but systematic variations of the transport coefficient during the stability experiment up to 675 K. Although the overall performance is not significantly affected, the systematic decrease in the Seebeck coefficient may indicate irreversible changes in the materials. The exact nature of these changes will require further experimental investigation.
2.8. First principles calculations
All the calculations were computed using the quantum ESPRESSO39 package as incorporated in the high-throughput infrastructure of AFLOW π.40 Optimized norm-conserving PBE pseudopotentials,41 well converged basis sets corresponding to an energy cutoff of 150 Ry for the wave functions and 600 Ry for the charge density, and ACBN0 functional approach42 have been used to self-consistently determine the values for the Hubbard corrections for each atomic species of the material. To integrate over the Brillouin zone, a 8 × 4 × 8 (shifted) grid was used for the monoclinic Cu5Sn2S7 (space group C2).
Transport properties such as, Seebeck coefficient S, electrical conductivity σ, and electronic contribution to thermal conductivity κe, were computed by solving Boltzmann transport equation within the constant relaxation time and the rigid band approximation as implemented in PAOFLOW.43 Correction to relaxation time and computation of lattice thermal conductivity κl have been performed a posteriori comparing experimental electrical resistivity, experimental thermal conductivity, computed electrical conductivity, and computed electronic thermal conductivity.
Helmholtz free energy were obtained using the calculated phonon density of states employing quasi-harmonic approximation.44
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Structure analysis

3.1.1. X-ray powder diffraction analysis of the system Cu2+xSn1−xS3. 
The X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) patterns recorded on the Cu2+xSn1−xS3 samples for x = 0, 0.075, and 0.15 (Fig. 1), exhibit high intensity diffraction peaks related to the sphalerite structure, characterized by a progressive shifting toward high angles as the Cu/Sn ratio increases. This indicates that the size of the pseudo sphalerite sub-cell decreases as the copper content increases in agreement with the smaller ionic radius of Cu+ compared to Sn4+. However, low intensity peaks appear, which are different in positions suggesting different orderings of these sphalerite derivatives. Note that the absence of common superstructure diffraction peaks indicates the absence of phase mixture.
 Fig. 1  XRPD patterns of Cu2SnS3 (green), Cu2.075Sn0.925S3 (red), and Cu2.15Sn0.85S3 ( i.e. Cu5Sn2S7, blue) samples. 
The XRPD pattern analysis of the x = 0 sample confirms the formation of the monoclinic Cu2SnS3 mohite phase: Cc, a = 6.656(1) Å, b = 11.525(2) Å, c = 6.658(1) Å, and β = 109.52(1)° (Fig. S3†). The XRPD pattern of the x = 0.075 sample could be indexed in a tetragonal unit cell similar to that of kuramite (I2m) in agreement with the observations reported by Deng et al. in Cu7Sn3S10 (x = 0.1).3 However, while apparent high quality Rietveld refinements are obtained with a kuramite structural model, all the attempts lead to anomalous refined atomic parameters. In particular, the compositional refinements, leading to much lower tin content than that of the nominal composition Cu2.075Sn0.925S3, suggest that the structural model proposed by Deng et al.3 does not fit this composition. Note that Deng et al. also mentioned a chemical composition deviation with a much lower refined tin content than that of the nominal composition but decided to overcome this deviation by fixing the site occupancies in accordance with the nominal composition. A redetermination of the crystal structure of this phase is in progress.
The XRPD pattern analysis of the x = 0.15 sample (Cu2.15Sn0.85S3) indicates the formation of a new compound in the ternary system Cu–Sn–S. The splitting of the main diffraction peak at 2θ = 13.4° (i.e. corresponding to the reflection 111 in sphalerite structure at wavelength of 0.7273 Å) in two distinct reflections suggests that the compound crystallizes in a monoclinic unit cell (Fig. 2). This is confirmed by the perfect indexing of all diffraction peaks with the refined unit cell parameters a = 12.0580(5) Å, b = 5.4063(2) Å, c = 8.5026(3) Å, and β = 98.163(3)°. The systematic absence of the reflections hkl with h + k = 2n + 1 indicates a C-face centered unit cell and the presence of reflections h0l with l = 2n + 1 allows to exclude the presence of a c glide mirror (Fig. 2). Moreover, the presence of the high intensity diffraction peaks related to the sphalerite structure suggests that a centrosymmetric space group can be excluded. Consequently, the possible space groups are either C2 or Cm.

3.1.2. Combined PEDT and synchrotron XRPD refinements of Cu5Sn2S7 (x = 0.15) structure. 
Structure analysis based on precession-assisted electron diffraction tomography (PEDT) was carried out on sub-micrometer single crystals obtained from the same powder sample. First, by examining the reconstructed reciprocal space of several crystals, we can confirm the C-centered monoclinic lattice with possible space groups C2, Cm or C2/m (Fig. 3). Secondly, symmetry analysis45 of the structure solution performed using the charge flipping method,46 indicates the C2 as more probable with symmetry agreement factors ranked as follow: 2(0,1,0) = 5.7, m(0,1,0) = 19.7, −1 = 20.1 and c(0,1,0) = 55.4. From these crystallographic considerations and literature data, the structural model reported by Schäfer et al.23 for Cu4NiSi2S7 (space group C2) seems well adapted when Ni and Si atoms are replaced by Cu and Sn atoms, respectively. The PEDT study of this compound detailed in ESI (Tables S1 and S2†) in combination with the structural refinement indicates that the chemical composition of this ternary compound is Cu5Sn2S7. Rietveld refinement of synchrotron XRPD pattern confirms this structural model and the sample purity, with well reproduced intensities of the superstructure diffraction peaks (Fig. 2). Crystallographic data of Cu5Sn2S7 obtained by Rietveld refinement against the synchrotron XRPD data are gathered in Table 1.
 Fig. 3  Reciprocal space sections reconstructed from PEDT data for Cu5Sn2S7 with: (a) h0l, (b) hk0 and (c) 0kl. The dotted lines are used as a guide to the eyes to visualize the reciprocal lattice mesh. The conditions limiting the existence of reflections: h0l: h = 2n, hk0: h + k = 2n and 0kl: k = 2n are compatible with a C-centering. In (a), reflections with indexation h0l l = 2n + 1 are clearly visible excluding the presence of a c glide mirror. 


3.1.3. Comparison of the monoclinic Cu2SnS3 and Cu5Sn2S7 structures. 
The crystal structure of mohite Cu2SnS3 is built up of corner-sharing CuS4 and SnS4 tetrahedra (Fig. 4) leading to a cationic ordered monoclinic sphalerite framework. A specific structural feature of this sphalerite-derivative framework is related to the existence of zigzag chains of SnS4 tetrahedra oriented along the c-axis, (Fig. S4a†). These zigzag chains are separated from each other, along both the a-axis and b-axis, by zigzag chains of CuS4 tetrahedra oriented along the c-axis (Fig. S4b†). The crystal structure of mohite is completed by chains of the remaining CuS4 tetrahedra oriented along the [101] direction (Fig. S4c†).

Also, the crystal structure of Cu5Sn2S7 is built up of corner-sharing CuS4 and SnS4 tetrahedral network (Fig. 4), corresponding to a cationic ordered monoclinic sphalerite framework. In this monoclinic structure, however, SnS4 tetrahedra are linked two by two by the S atom in the 2a position (i.e. S1), leading to the existence of tetrahedral Sn2S7 dimers. These dimers form with Cu atoms in the 2b position (i.e. Cu1) cationic ordered zigzag layers in the (b,c) plane (Fig. 5a). These cationic ordered zigzag layers are separated from each other along the a-axis by zigzag layers formed by Cu2 and Cu3 atoms. Within these monoatomic zigzag layers, Cu2 atoms form CuS4 layers in the (a,b) plane (Fig. 5b) and Cu3 atoms form CuS4 chains oriented along the b-axis (Fig. 5c). From a “Cu–S” conductive network point of view, the ordered sphalerite structure of Cu5Sn2S7 can be viewed as a tridimensional [Cu5S7]∞ tetrahedral framework forming tunnels running along the c-axis where the Sn2S7 dimers are located (Fig. 5d).

The interatomic distances in Cu5Sn2S7, calculated from the Rietveld refinement against the synchrotron XRPD data, are coherent with those generally encountered in copper sulfides with a sphalerite framework, except those between Cu2 and S1 atoms and between Sn4 and S1 atoms, which are longer than the average Cu–S and Sn–S distances, respectively (Table 2). These abnormally long distances for a sphalerite-type framework, both involving S1 atom, suggest a non-negligible role of Sn2S7 dimers on the deformation of the “Cu–S” conductive network. This is supported by the average deviation from the ideal tetrahedral angle, more pronounced for Cu1 tetrahedra (Δave = 3.65°), which is directly linked to the Sn2S7 dimers, than for Cu3 (Δave = 1.95°) and Cu2 (Δave = 1.34°) tetrahedra. Moreover, Rietveld refinement shows that the average deviation from the ideal angle in the SnS4 tetrahedra is equivalent in Cu5Sn2S7 (Δave = 2.29°) and Cu2SnS3 (Δave = 2.48°, calculated from data reported by Onoda et al.17). However, in Cu2SnS3 the maximum deviations are much higher (−6.4°/+3.7°) than those observed in Cu5Sn2S7 (−4.0°/+2.5°) explaining the larger Mössbauer ΔEQ value of 1.02 mm s−1 (see Section 3.1.5) measured in Cu2SnS3 compared to that of 0.77 mm s−1 measured in Cu5Sn2S7, as well as the lower mean square relative displacements at the Sn site refined from EXAFS data (see Section 3.1.7) for Cu5Sn2S7 compared to Cu2SnS3. Note that in both crystal structures, Sn atoms are located on a site of local symmetry 1.

Thus, the two monoclinic sulfides Cu2SnS3 (mohite) and Cu5Sn2S7, corresponding to x = 0 and x = 0.148 (refined composition) respectively, are highly ordered and the nature of their cationic ordering in the sphalerite framework is very sensitive to the Sn content. One indeed observes the formation of [SnS3]∞ zigzag chains of corner-sharing SnS4 tetrahedra in Cu2SnS3 (mohite Cc structure), whereas Sn2S7 dimers are observed in Cu5Sn2S7 (C2 structure).
The structural evolution of the system Cu2+xSn1−xS3 shows a very remarkable feature: although the three compositions exhibit the same sphalerite sub-lattice, the variation in the cationic composition does not allow for a continuous solid solution corresponding to a statistic distribution of the Sn4+ and Cu+ cations in the tetrahedral sites to be obtained. In other words, two ordered sphalerite structures are formed for x = 0 and x = 0.15 respectively, which are “immiscible” in spite of their close structural relationships and compositions. Moreover, the intermediate x = 0.075 composition does not correspond to a mixture of these two ordered sphalerite structures, but to a single phase whose unknown crystal structure is also a derivative of the sphalerite and might be partially ordered/disordered. This behavior can be explained by the fact that the size difference between the Sn4+ and Cu+ cations, though rather small, governs the matching of the CuS4 and SnS4 tetrahedra in the sphalerite framework and consequently their mode of ordering in those sphalerite-type structures. The comparison of the Sn–S distances ranging from 2.40 to 2.49 Å with the Cu–S distances ranging from 2.29 to 2.35 Å in Cu5Sn2S7 (Table 2) clearly suggests that the mode of cationic ordering is highly sensitive to the size difference between Sn4+ and Cu+ cations.


3.1.4. Transmission electron microscopy: ED, EDX and HAADF study of Cu5Sn2S7 (x = 0.15). 
In order to confirm the purity of the Cu5Sn2S7 sample determined by synchrotron XRPD and to further investigate the homogeneity of the chemical composition and structure at the atomic scale, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analyses were performed. Electron diffraction (ED) and EDX elemental mapping were used to confirm the crystal structure of Cu5Sn2S7 in connection with its chemical composition. ED patterns collected for the main zones (Fig. S5a†) can be fully indexed based on the monoclinic C2 structure (see Table 1). No superstructure spots have been observed. EDX elemental mapping (Fig. S5b†) shows a fairly homogeneous distribution of all the elements and gives the following atomic ratio Cu/Sn/S = 38.3/16.24/45.4 (at%) which is close to the nominal composition.
High angle annular dark field scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM) images of crystallites along two most informative zone axis ([010] and [110]) demonstrate the good crystallinity of the sample and the fair correspondence with the monoclinic structure determined by PEDT and synchrotron XRPD (Fig. 6). The images demonstrate a uniform contrast free from any modulations and defects in accordance to the structural model. HAADF-STEM image simulation using this structure model shows good agreement with experimental images (Fig. 6 insets). ED and HAADF-STEM studies revealed numerous twinning phenomena, which are visible along the [010] and [110] zone axes. Fig. 6e shows the HAADF-STEM image of one of the examples of the {110} twinning viewed along the [110] direction. The twin boundary is parallel to <110> planes. On the basis of the HAADF-STEM image, a structural model for the twin boundary is presented in Fig. 6f (bottom panel).

3.1.5. 
            119Sn Mössbauer spectroscopy. 
In order to shed light on the influence of the Cu/Sn ratio on the local environment of tin atoms in the Cu2+xSn1−xS3 series, 119Sn Mössbauer spectra were recorded at room temperature for the three samples: x = 0, x = 0.075, and x = 0.15. The least-squares fits of the experimental data are shown in Fig. 7 and the corresponding hyperfine parameters are given in Table 3.

Experimental data and least-squares fits are represented by black crosses and red lines, respectively.

First, fits of the 119Sn Mössbauer spectrum evidence a doublet centered at 1.54 mm s−1 (with respect to BaSnO3 at room temperature) for the three samples. This indicates that Sn atoms are in their +IV oxidation state47 and in tetrahedral environment of sulfur.48–51 Additionally, the fact that this value is unchanged indicates that the valence electron density at the tin nucleus is equivalent,52,53 whatever the sample composition. This result highlights that Cu for Sn substitution in the Cu2+xSn1−xS3 series does not influence the oxidation state of Sn atoms. The full width at half maximum (FWHM or Γ) of the peaks is similar for the three samples and is equivalent to values observed in well-ordered sphalerite framework compounds.51–53 Finally, the quadrupole splitting (ΔEQ) decreases with the tin content from 1.02 mm s−1 for Cu2SnS3 to 0.77 mm s−1 for Cu5Sn2S7 (Table 3). As ΔEQ value reflects the deviation from a spherical symmetry of the charge distribution at the nucleus, it suggests that the environment of the Sn4+ cations is less anisotropic in Cu5Sn2S7 than in Cu2SnS3. This point will be discussed in detail in the following sections. On the other hand, the ΔEQ value of 0.90 mm s−1 for the Cu2.075Sn0.925S3 sample suggests a structural disordering instead of a distorted environment. It strongly supports our preliminary XRPD study suggesting that the crystal structure of this intermediate phase merits to be reinvestigated.


3.1.6. Formation energies computed from first principles calculations. 
Assuming Cu+, Sn4+, and S2−, charge compensation indicates that Cu2SnS3 is fully compensated while Cu5Sn2S7 has two holes per unit cell. Formation energies (Table 4) computed from first principles indicate that the C2 Cu5Sn2S7 and the Cc Cu2SnS3 at zero temperature are equivalent within 1 meV. By including the vibrational effects, C2 phase gains relative stability with temperature up to 15 meV at 700 K. Within the uncertainty of the structural model due to partial occupations, the tetragonal and cubic phases are about 120–130 meV higher in formation energy.
Table 4 Formation energies per atom with respect to elemental solids. The monoclinic Cc Cu2SnS3 (x = 0, bold) is favored to form. At x = 0.15, the most favored structure is the monoclinic C2 Cu5Sn2S7 (bold). The values for x = 0.083, 0.167, and 0.750 were computed using a 64 atoms supercell to model the Sn-Cu disorder. All the disordered phases are less favored.

We conjecture that the replacement of Sn with Cu drives the formation of the new monoclinic phase by injecting holes into the system and introducing local stresses associated with Sn–Cu size mismatch. These trigger interactions, which favor the formation and long-range ordering of “dimers” of Sn centered tetrahedra.


3.1.7. X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy/extended X-ray absorption fine structure analysis. 

Fig. 8 shows XANES spectra for Cu2SnS3, Cu2.075Sn0.925S3 and Cu2.15Sn0.85S3 samples with respect to standard compounds Cu metal, Cu2S and Cu(NH3)42+. The spectral shape for each sample is relatively similar, confirming a similar local structure (sphalerite framework) for all the samples with the position of the edges mainly suggesting an oxidation state 1+ for copper (Fig. 8a). Among the small differences between the samples, we could notice for Cu2.075Sn0.925S3 and Cu2.15Sn0.85S3 samples a slight blue-shift of the edge with respect to Cu2SnS3 (red arrow in Fig. 8a) and the appearance of a small contribution at around 8977 eV (blue arrow in Fig. 8a). Both features could be attributed to the presence of a small contribution of Cu2+, in particular the peak at 8977 eV is assigned to quadrupolar transition of 1s → 3d Cu level (Fig. S6†). Note that in Cu+ 3d levels are normally fully occupied and, consequently, not available for the transition. Such assignment is confirmed by the presence of similar pre-edge peak in the model compound Cu(NH3)42+ (blue arrow in Fig. 8a) or in CuS.54
 Fig. 8  XANES spectra: (a) Cu K-edge and (b) Sn K-edge, for Cu2SnS3 (blue curve), Cu2.075Sn0.925S3 (red curve) and Cu2.15Sn0.85S3 (black curve). The inset in (a) focuses on a region around the quadrupolar 1s → 3d transition peak. In order to isolate such transition from the background, the spectrum of Cu2SnS3 have been subtracted from Cu2.15Sn0.85S3 (black curve) and Cu2.075Sn0.925S3 (red curve) spectra, while for the spectra of Cu(NH3)42+ a spline function has been used. 
The good agreement between XANES simulation and experimental spectra (Fig. S7†) shows that the crystal structure is also representative of the actual local structure around the copper atoms. Moreover, it is clear by increasing the size of used cluster during simulations that the several features on the spectra result from long range interactions.
The XANES spectra at Sn K-edge contain comparatively fewer features (Fig. 8b). Indeed, the spectra are affected by the large core hole lifetime of 1s level, ∼6 eV, that prevents fine feature to be present. Despite this lack in resolution, it is clear that the decreasing content of Sn does not affect the XANES spectra that are basically superimposed for all the three samples, suggesting no variation in the oxidation state. This result is in fair agreement with 119Sn Mössbauer data.
The EXAFS signals for Cu and Sn K edges and results of its analysis are shown in Fig. 9. All the data have good statistics allowing significant fit with good agreement factors (Table 5). As can be observed, the signals are dominated by a single frequency attributed to the single scattering of sulfur atoms in the first coordination shell. A small signal around 3.7 Å (not phase corrected) is present for Sn signal attributed to the contributions of the second shell, which has not been fitted due to numerous different components composing the signals. Second shell contributions are absent in the Cu signals reflecting the large heterogeneity of contributions due to the presence of different crystallographic sites for Cu atoms.

Although the spectra results are very similar, differences are just above the estimation of standard deviation (Table 5), it should be noticed that all refined parameters showed a strong correlation with the Sn concentration in the samples. For both edges, the Cu–S and Sn–S bonds lengths decrease with the increase in Cu content. In the case of copper, this effect could be explained by a partial oxidation, as noticed by the XANES analysis. Moreover, the mean square relative displacements refined at Sn K edge decrease with increasing Cu content (Table 5), reflecting a decrease of disorder at the tin site from Cu2SnS3 to Cu5Sn2S7, in agreement with 119Sn Mössbauer results.
Finally, the fitted distances are in good general agreement with diffraction data, although a direct comparison should be taken with caution due to the different nature of the two techniques (local order vs. long range order). Both distances found by EXAFS or XRPD are in reasonable agreement with the expected values calculated by the bond valence sum method,55 although Sn–S bond lengths are slightly longer than expected.

3.2. Transport properties and DFT calculations

Fig. 10a and b show the temperature-dependent electrical resistivity (ρ) and Seebeck coefficient (S), respectively, of the Cu2+xSn1−xS3 series from room temperature to 700 K. The very high ρ and positive S values, that reach ∼1800 mΩ cm and 740 μV K−1 at 300 K, respectively, indicate that pristine Cu2SnS3 behaves as a lightly-doped, nearly-intrinsic p-type semiconductor.
 Fig. 10  Temperature dependence of the (a) electrical resistivity (ρ), (b) Seebeck coefficient (S), (c) thermal conductivity (κ), (d) lattice thermal conductivity (κL), (e) power factor (PF), and (f) dimensionless figure of merit ZT for the Cu2+xSn1−xS3 series. 
This semiconducting nature is consistent with the electronic band structure of the Cc phase pointing to a relatively large electronic band gap Eg of 0.8 eV and a valence band dominated by the hybridization of the Cu d-states with the S p-states with a negligible contribution from the Sn states.26 The theoretical value of Eg is in good agreement with the value of 0.82 eV inferred from the Goldsmid-Sharp relation Eg = 2eSmaxTmax, where e is the elementary charge and Smax = 780 μV K−1 is the maximum S value achieved at Tmax = 525 K. Both values are in reasonable agreement with the value of 0.95 eV inferred experimentally from optical absorption spectroscopy on polycrystalline Cu2SnS3 samples.18
Varying the Cu-to-Sn ratio results in a significant decrease in ρ and S, which both increase with increasing temperature indicative of degenerate p-type semiconducting behaviors. The C2 Cu5Sn2S7 phase (x = 0.15) contains two holes per unit cell (Z = 2), leading to a degenerate semiconductor (Fig. 11) with the Fermi level 0.38 eV below the top of S–Cu manifold. Sn states contribute to the highly dispersive unoccupied band starting at 0.36 eV above the top of the S–Cu valence manifold.
 Fig. 11  Electronic band structure of monoclinic C2 Cu5Sn2S7 computed within the ACBN0 approach. 
The significant decrease in electrical resistivity with increasing Cu over-stoichiometry, from 1800 mΩ cm for x = 0.00 to much lower values ranging from 0.1 mΩ cm at 300 K up to about 0.35 mΩ cm at 700 K in the x = 0.15 sample (Cu5Sn2S7), is consistent with the increased metallicity. Likewise, S increases from 35 μV K−1 at 300 K to 85 μV K−1 at 700 K for Cu2.075Sn0.925S3 and from 15 μV K−1 at 300 K to 58 μV K−1 at 700 K for Cu2.15Sn0.85S3. Both samples exhibit S values that are an order of magnitude lower than those of pristine Cu2SnS3, due to their degenerate semiconducting behavior. First principles calculations of the Seebeck coefficient within the constant scattering approximation are in fair agreement with the experimental data (Fig. S8†). We have fitted the temperature dependence of the scattering time obtaining a variation from 0.8 × 10−14 s at 300 K to 2.9 × 10−14 s at 800 K.
With two holes per unit cell in the C2 phase, the theoretical hole concentration (pH) is expected to be around 4 × 1021 cm−3. In agreement with these considerations, experimental values of pH increase from approximately 2.20 × 1017 cm−3 in pristine Cu2SnS3 to 4.70 × 1021 cm−3 for x = 0.075 and to 5.75 × 1021 cm−3 for x = 0.15 at 300 K.
The weak temperature dependence of pH in the x = 0.075 and x = 0.15 samples upon cooling to 5 K is consistent with their degenerate behaviors (Fig. S9†). The hole concentrations achieved in the present series are similar to those measured in the sulfur-based compounds Cu7Sn3S10 (2.7 × 1021 cm−3), Cu2.08Sn0.92S3 (∼2.3 × 1021 cm−3) or in the Se analogue Cu5Sn2Se7 (∼3.1 × 1021 cm−3).3,19,24 Increasing the Cu content to x = 0.15, twice as high as in Cu2.075Sn0.925S3, does not lead to a similar increase in pH because of the influence of the crystal structure modifications.
The key role played by the lattice symmetry and crystal structure on the electronic properties of the x = 0.075 and 0.15 samples is highlighted by the distinct temperature-dependent behaviors and magnitudes of the Hall mobility μH, shown in Fig. S10.† Despite the higher hole concentration in the x = 0.15 sample compared to the x = 0.075 sample, μH increases from 4.6 cm2 V−1 s−1 for x = 0.075 to 11.7 cm2 V−1 s−1 for x = 0.15 at 300 K. Upon cooling, μH increases for both compounds to reach 8.8 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 140 cm2 V−1 s−1 at 5 K for the x = 0.075 and 0.15 sample, respectively. While both samples show nearly temperature-independent μH values below about 30 K, suggesting neutral impurity scattering as the dominant scattering mechanism, μH(T) follows distinct dependences above this temperature. For the x = 0.15 sample, μH(T) evolves according to a T−3/2 law characteristic of acoustic phonon scattering. In contrast, the weaker decrease in μH(T) for x = 0.075 roughly follows a T−1/2 dependence indicative of alloy scattering, observed, for instance, in solid solutions or strongly off-stoichiometric compounds.56,57 Thus, these results indicate a higher level of atomic disorder in the x = 0.075 sample with respect to the x = 0.15 sample. Of note, because of the comparable grain size (500 nm−1 μm, Fig. S11†) and relative density (91–92%) of the SPS pellets, this variation in the prevailing scattering mechanism is not due to microstructural effects and can be thus considered as intrinsic to both compounds. Although they exhibit the same sphalerite sublattice, the cationic ordering substantially differs, leading to two different Cu–S frameworks. Calculations of the real-space partial charge density distribution performed for Cu2SnS3 have indicated that the three-dimensional [–Cu–S–Cu–] network forms an antibonding conductive framework that favors hole transport and helps to maintain relatively high mobility values.26 The low mobility values of the x = 0.075 sample and their temperature dependence suggest a more disordered conductive network formed by CuS4 tetrahedra due to cationic mixed occupancies. In contrast, a well-ordered crystal structure is observed in the monoclinic C2 phase (Cu5Sn2S7, x = 0.15) with Cu solely occupying three independent crystallographic sites (2b, 4c and 4c), which likely favors a similar highly-conductive framework and explains the conventional behavior of μH(T) observed in most of thermoelectric materials used above room temperature. In addition, electronic band structure calculations show that, in the proximity of the Fermi energy, the electronic levels tend to exhibit quasi-linear dispersion (Fig. 11) leading to low average effective masses. Indeed, analyzing the electronic band structure in a window of 600 meV centered on the Fermi level, we have found 31 k-points corresponding to ∇kEn(k) = 0 (interestingly many saddle points), averaging out across the Brillouin zone gives an DOS effective mass of about 0.6m0 which also correspond to the effective mass at the top of the valence manifold at Γ. The low  is consistent with the high hole mobility of the conductive network. We further note that this value is significantly lower from those inferred from a single isotropic parabolic band model (SPB) with acoustic phonon scattering as the dominant scattering mechanism that yields large values of 5.1m0 and 2.4m0 for the x = 0.075 and 0.15 samples, respectively. While similar to those determined in a prior theoretical study,26 the significant difference with the value computed herein reflects the limit of the SPB model in describing transport in multiband systems and in capturing effects such as high alloy scattering potential.
The temperature dependence of the power factor PF = S2/ρ is shown in Fig. 10e for the three Cu2+xSn1−xS3 compositions. The highest value is obtained for x = 0.075 over the whole temperature, with values increasing from 0.45 mW m−1 K−2 at 300 K to 1.03 mW m−1 K−2 at 700 K. These high values may stem from sharp features in the density of states due to chemical disorder. The maximum value of 1.05 mW m−1 K−2 achieved at 650 K is comparable to that obtained in Zn- and Co-doped Cu2SnS3, and only slightly below that achieved in Cu7Sn3S10.1,3,16 In contrast, the highly-metallic monoclinic phase, x = 0.15, exhibits a combination of low electrical resistivity and Seebeck coefficient, resulting in moderate power factors that range between 0.3 mW m−1 K−2 at 300 K and 0.94 mW m−1 K−2 at 700 K.

Fig. 10c shows the temperature dependence of the total thermal conductivity κ for the Cu2+xSn1−xS3 series. At room temperature, the pristine phase Cu2SnS3 exhibits a relatively low κ value of ∼2.5 W m−1 K−1, which is consistent with the value of 2.4 W m−1 K−1 measured by Shen et al. in the series Cu2Sn1−xZnxS3.1 For the Cu-rich samples, κ increases gradually with increasing the Cu content to reach 4.3 W m−1 K−1 and 9.5 W m−1 K−1 at 300 K for the x = 0.075 and x = 0.15 samples, respectively. Regardless of the chemical composition, κ decreases upon heating to 0.8, 2.5 and 3.8 W m−1 K−1 at 700 K for the x = 0.0, 0.075 and x = 0.15 samples, respectively.
The κ values of Cu2SnS3 mainly reflect the lattice contribution κL due to its nearly intrinsic semiconducting nature that gives rise to high ρ values and hence, to a negligible electronic contribution κe according to the Wiedemann–Franz law κe = LT/ρ, where L is the Lorenz number. In contrast, the significantly higher values of the two Cu-rich samples are due to their degenerate semiconducting behavior that induces higher electronic contributions.
In order to dissociate the lattice and electronic contributions from the total thermal conductivity, the Wiedemann–Franz law was applied by taking into account the temperature dependence of the Lorenz number using a single-parabolic-band model with acoustic phonon scattering. While this approach could be successfully applied to the x = 0.075 sample, the calculated L values for the x = 0.15 sample led to unphysical negative values at high temperatures. This inadequacy of the present model to calculate L is due to the multiband nature of the valence band structure of this compound that results in lower L values than those predicted for a highly-degenerate hole gas using the SPB model. This difficulty in determining the lattice contribution has been highlighted in several thermoelectric materials, such as SnTe, for which the presence of several electronic bands tends to lower the L values despite the strongly degenerate nature of the compound.58–61
The temperature dependence of κL for the x = 0.075 sample is shown in Fig. 10d. For comparison purposes, the data of the pristine compound has been added. For both compounds, the strong decrease with increasing temperature reflects the dominance of phonon–phonon Umklapp scattering processes, which leads to κL(T) curves nearly following a T−1 law. The lower κL values observed in the x = 0.075 sample compared to those of Cu2SnS3 suggests a more pronounced disordered character of the former, in agreement by the Hall mobility data. This increased disorder leads to a strong enhancement of point-defect scattering, yielding a minimum κL value of 0.55 W m−1 K−1 at 700 K. These remarkably very low values are similar to those typically observed in tetrahedrites and in strongly-disordered colusites.50,62–65
The temperature dependence of the dimensionless thermoelectric figure of merit, ZT, of the Cu2+xSn1−xS3 compounds is shown in Fig. 10f. The ZT values increase monotonically for all the compositions with increasing temperature. The Cu2.075Sn0.925S3 sample exhibits the highest peak ZT value of 0.3 at 700 K, that originates from the favorable combination of high power factor and very low lattice thermal conductivity. This maximum ZT remains nevertheless moderate, compared to those achieved in optimized tetrahedrites and colusites,20,62–64,66 due to the highly metallic character of this compound.
4. Conclusions
We have discovered an ordered sphalerite derivative Cu5Sn2S7 (C2 monoclinic), in the Cu–Sn–S diagram and clarified the complex crystal chemistry in this class of materials. The phase obtained for x = 0.15 corresponds to Cu5Sn2S7 and is stabilized by an interplay between structure and stoichiometry that governs the ordering of Cu and Sn on the cationic sublattice. The C2 phase includes an interacting pair of Sn centered tetrahedra, which favors the delocalization of the holes of the surrounding sulfur atoms (Fig. 12). The electrostatic interaction between the tetrahedra dimers, due to the excess of positive charges on Sn, energetically favors a long-range ordering. The combination of (1) long range order, (2) a well-connected conductive sphalerite framework enriched by delocalized electrons provided by Sn, and (3) low average effective masses, lead to the largest hole mobility observed so far in p-type bulk Cu–Sn–S compounds. This is remarkable when considering the high carrier concentration of 5.75 × 1021 cm−3 in Cu5Sn2S7. The specific tridimensional [Cu5S7]∞ tetrahedral framework forming tunnels running along the c-axis, where the Sn2S7 dimers are located, favors a high carrier mobility in the conductive network. The plot of the mobility versus carrier concentration (p > 1 × 1021 cm−3) at 300 K (Fig. 13) highlights the special character of this phase among related p-type bulk Cu-based ternary and quaternary sulfides. Adjustment of the hole concentration through aliovalent substitutions should also lead to significant optimization of the ZT, possibly making this ternary compound competitive among the highly-efficient, sulfur-based thermoelectric materials developed so far. In this regard, electronic band structure calculations have indicated that substitutions on the Sn site might be beneficial for optimizing the hole concentration and preserving the multivalence band structure that tends to favor high Seebeck coefficients, while maintaining a high hole mobility in the “Cu–S” conductive network. Such cationic substitution can then provide an additional tuning knob to increase the number of electrons, moving the Fermi level upward, and partially filling up the two holes per unit cell (Z = 2). Interestingly, the complete filling of the valence bands would lead to a semiconductor with a bandgap of around 1 eV, which is in an optimal range for photovoltaic application. The hole mobility should be also increased due to the decrease in the carrier concentration, which is of interest for optimizing the PV performances.

Values for the ELF range between 0 and 1: ELF = 0.5 (blue contours) indicates free electron behavior and ELF = 1.0 (red contour) indicates perfect localization. Values smaller than 0.5 are less significant and usually point to small local electron density. Values for the charge density range between 0.3 (blue) and 1.0 (red).

 	Fig. 6  HAADF-STEM images for two main zone axis [010] (a and b) and [110] (c and d) and corresponding ED patterns. The simulated HAADF-STEM images based on the C2 monoclinic structure determined by PEDT and synchrotron XRPD are given as insets. The magnified images with overlaid color structural models are present in (b) and (d) panel (Sn-blue, Cu-orange and S-yellow). [110] HAADF-STEM image of the twinning region and corresponding FT pattern (e). The panel (f) shows a magnified twin boundary and the corresponding structural model (Sn-blue, Cu-orange and S-yellow). The twin plane is indicated by white arrows and dashed line.	 

 	Fig. 7  Room temperature 119Sn Mössbauer spectra of the Cu2+xSn1−xS3 samples: (left) x = 0, mohite Cu2SnS3 phase (space group Cc); (middle) x = 0.075; (right) x = 0.15, Cu5Sn2S7 phase (space group C2). Experimental data and least-squares fits are represented by black crosses and red lines, respectively.

 	Fig. 8  XANES spectra: (a) Cu K-edge and (b) Sn K-edge, for Cu2SnS3 (blue curve), Cu2.075Sn0.925S3 (red curve) and Cu2.15Sn0.85S3 (black curve). The inset in (a) focuses on a region around the quadrupolar 1s → 3d transition peak. In order to isolate such transition from the background, the spectrum of Cu2SnS3 have been subtracted from Cu2.15Sn0.85S3 (black curve) and Cu2.075Sn0.925S3 (red curve) spectra, while for the spectra of Cu(NH3)42+ a spline function has been used.	 

 	Fig. 9  Experimental EXAFS data (black curve with scatter) and fit (red curve) for samples Cu2SnS3, Cu2.075Sn0.925S3, and Cu2.15Sn0.85S3 at the Cu (top part) and Sn (bottom part) K-edges. Unfiltered χ(k)k2 signals and its magnitude of Fourier transformation (FT) are shown in the right and left side respectively.

 	Fig. 10  Temperature dependence of the (a) electrical resistivity (ρ), (b) Seebeck coefficient (S), (c) thermal conductivity (κ), (d) lattice thermal conductivity (κL), (e) power factor (PF), and (f) dimensionless figure of merit ZT for the Cu2+xSn1−xS3 series.	 

 	Fig. 11  Electronic band structure of monoclinic C2 Cu5Sn2S7 computed within the ACBN0 approach.	 

 	Fig. 12  Contour of the Electron Localization Factor (ELF) (top) and charge density (bottom) for selected planes of monoclinic C2 Cu5Sn2S7. Values for the ELF range between 0 and 1: ELF = 0.5 (blue contours) indicates free electron behavior and ELF = 1.0 (red contour) indicates perfect localization. Values smaller than 0.5 are less significant and usually point to small local electron density. Values for the charge density range between 0.3 (blue) and 1.0 (red).	 

 	Fig. 13  Current state-of-the-art mobility (left) and carrier concentration (right) values at 300 K in p-type bulk copper-based sulfides. Different families are highlighted with different colors. Among them we underline colusites (magenta and blue) and Cu2SnS3 derivatives (orange), present work in red.1,3,16,19,20,64,67–71
