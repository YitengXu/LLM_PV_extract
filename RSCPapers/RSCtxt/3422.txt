    , Accepted 13th November 2019First published on 15th November 2019AbstractThe relatively low open circuit voltage (Voc) of organic solar cells (OSCs) with narrow and ultra-narrow bandgap fused-ring electron acceptors limits further improvement of the OSCs. Simply down-shifting the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels of the donors always results in the trade-off between the Voc and short circuit current (Jsc). In this work, we reported three novel noncovalently locked polymer donors based on different side-chain-modified benzodithiophene (BDT) units alternately copolymerized with an electron-deficient 3,3′-dicarboxylate-substituted difluorotetrathiophene building block for efficient OSCs. Due to the existence of the electron-affinity moiety, deep HOMO levels are obtained for these copolymer donors, enabling the highest recorded Voc of 0.99 V when blended with the IT-4F acceptor. Meanwhile, intramolecular noncovalent interactions in these copolymers favor a preferential face-on orientation. Efficient charge transport and exciton dissociation under a low driving force are observed in these novel polymer donors. Consequently, the device processed from a non-halogenated solvent shows a high efficiency of 12.5% with simultaneously high Voc and Jsc, which is one of the highest performances of non-halogenated-solvent-processed OSCs to date. These results demonstrate that the synergistic effect of the energy band structure and molecular geometry can provide an effective molecular design strategy for high performance OSCs.
Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have received widespread attention as a clean energy source, due to their low cost, light weight and adaption to roll-to-roll printing.1–9 Efficient OSCs are usually based on a binary system consisting of a p-type organic semiconductor electron donor and an n-type organic semiconductor acceptor.10–15 Among the various acceptors, fused-ring electron acceptors (FREAs) attract extensive attention because of the constant rise of the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of FREA-based OSCs.16–18
The most important features of FREAs compared to other acceptors, e.g. fullerene derivatives, are their adjustable energy levels, absorption band and well-defined bulk heterojunction morphology.19,20 To further broaden the light harvesting range of the acceptors, some FREAs with a narrower bandgap extending their absorption to the visible-near infrared region have been developed. As a result, a substantially improved short-circuit current density (Jsc) and PCE were achieved.21–25 For example, when using the narrow bandgap acceptor IT-4F (bandgap = 1.53 eV), the OSC device achieved a PCE of 15.1% and a Jsc of 21.9 mA cm−2.17 Recently, a new ultra-narrow bandgap acceptor Y6 reported by Zou's group further improved the Jsc value to 26 mA cm−2, ascribed to the extended light absorption (bandgap = 1.33 eV).16 However, the open circuit voltages (Voc) of devices with narrow and ultra-narrow bandgap FREAs (normally ∼0.8 V) are generally less than those of devices based on most traditional FREAs. This is because the reduction of the bandgap is realized by down-shifting the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of the acceptor, a positive proportional function of the Voc value, which is theoretically calculated from the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels of the donor and LUMO energy levels of the acceptor. Therefore, it is critical to develop polymer donors with deep HOMO levels when blended with these narrow bandgap FREAs. The recent photovoltaic progress of Voc and PCE values of devices based on IT-4F is summarized in Table S1.†17,26–37 The Voc values of high-performance devices with a PCE over 12% are generally in the range 0.84–0.94 V, and once the Voc value further increased to 0.95–0.98 V, the PCE significantly decreased. For example, Hou et al. recently reported a deep HOMO polymer donor PDBT(E)BTz-p. When blended with IT-4F, the device PDBT(E)BTz-p obtained a notable Voc of 0.98 V. However, due to a low Jsc of 14.9 mA cm−2 and a FF of 48.2%, the device only achieved a low PCE of 6.8%.34
On the other hand, maximizing the Voc by down-shifting the HOMO levels of the polymer donor will lead to the decrease of the ΔEHOMO, which is the offset HOMO level between the donor and acceptor. Normally, a ΔEHOMO of less than 0.3 eV could not provide sufficient driving force for exciton separation, resulting in Jsc reduction. Therefore, simply down-shifting the HOMO levels always results in the trade-off between the Voc and Jsc, which is detrimental to the enhancement of the performance of the OSCs. Recently, some semiconductive active materials with a low driving force of less than 0.3 eV have been reported.38–40 It was demonstrated that the ΔEHOMO even when reduced to 0.11 eV still showed promise for efficient hole transfer between the donor and acceptor. In our previous study, we also found that the ordered stacking of molecules could effectively achieve exciton separation at low driving force while maintaining high Voc and Jsc.41
Most high performance FREA devices are typically processed by halogenated solvents. The toxicity of halogenated solvents is unfavorable for large-scale production. More and more researchers appealed to replace traditional solvents (such as chlorobenzene, chloroform etc.) by non-halogenated solvents to ensure green solvent processing for OSCs. However, most non-halogenated solvent processed devices delivered inferior performance to the halogenated solvent processed ones. Up to now, only a few literature studies have reported a PCE exceeding 12% for non-halogenated solvent processed devices.17,42–52 Note that among these most efficient OSCs (PCE over 12%) based on a narrow bandgap acceptor IT-4F, the Voc values are in the range of 0.84–0.94 V. Such Voc values leave much room for improvement in the device efficiency, and higher requirement is put forward for molecular design of the donor materials.
In this work, we reported three novel green-solvent-processed polymer donors, namely PBDT-C4T, PBDT-F-C4T and PBDT-SF-C4T, with deep HOMO levels and noncovalent conformation locks as shown in Fig. 1a. These copolymers are prepared from the benzodithiophene (BDT) derivative unit copolymerized with a 3,3′-dicarboxylate-substituted difluorotetrathiophene (C4T) block. The difluorine and carboxylate substitutions with high electron affinity in the C4T block can effectively down-shift the HOMO levels of the resulting copolymer donors. The fluorine or sulfur atoms incorporated into BDT can further fine-tune the electron structure of backbones and broaden the absorption of the copolymers. More importantly, S⋯F and S⋯O intramolecular noncovalent interactions in the C4T block would favor a compact molecular packing.53,54 Deep HOMO levels as low as 5.66 eV were obtained for these copolymer donors, enabling a record Voc of 0.99 V when blended with the FREA IT-4F. Processing from a green solvent 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene (TMB), a high PCE of 12.5% was obtained for the PBDT-F-C4T:IT-4F device, which is one of the highest performances for green-solvent-processed OSCs.

Results and discussion
The structure and detailed synthetic routes of the three new copolymers are displayed in Fig. 1a and Scheme S1.† The copolymers PBDT-C4T, PBDT-F-C4T and PBDT-SF-C4T were easily synthesized from the C4T monomer alternatingly copolymerized with BDT, fluorinated BDT, and sulfurated and fluorinated BDT monomer via the Stille coupling reaction, respectively. All polymers dissolve well in non-halogenated solvents (such as TMB, xylene and tetrahydrofuran). The number molecular weights of all these polymers were obtained by gel permeation chromatography (GPC). The number molecular weights (n) of PBDT-C4T, PBDT-F-C4T and PBDT-SF-C4T are 32.2, 87.8 and 72.4 kDa, and the polydispersity indices (PDIs) are 1.9, 1.4 and 2.7, respectively. The decomposition temperatures (Td) of PBDT-C4T, PBDT-F-C4T and PBDT-SF-C4T characterized by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) are 355.5, 339 and 312.5 °C (see Fig. S1† and for detailed parameters, see Table 1), indicating that the three polymers have good thermal stability for OSC application.

Fig. 1b shows the UV-vis absorption spectra of the neat films (data are summarized in Table 1). Compared with the solution samples (see Fig. S2a†), all solid films exhibit red-shifted absorption, which implies the closer interchain packing. Besides, the polymers PBDT-F-C4T and PBDT-SF-C4T exhibit more pronounce red-shifted maximum absorption peaks than PBDT-C4T. This is because the incorporation of F atoms and S atoms can effectively push the absorption bands to the long wavelength region and enhance the light absorption intensity.55,56 The maximum absorption coefficients of the PBDT-C4T, PBDT-F-C4T and PBDT-SF-=C4T thin films are 6.2 × 104, 8.0 × 104 and 7.9 × 104 cm−1 (see Fig. 1c and Table 1). The higher absorption coefficient of PBDT-F-C4T and PBDT-SF-C4T helps achieve higher Jsc in the device. The corresponding optical bandgaps (Egopt) of PBDT-C4T, PBDT-F-C4T and PBDT-SF-C4T are 1.96, 1.95 and 1.94 eV, respectively. Thus, all the polymers are WBG polymers and possess a good complementary absorption range from 400–800 nm with the IT-4F acceptor (see the ESI Fig. S2b†).
The minimum energy conformation and frontier orbital structures of the three copolymers were calculated by density functional theory (DFT) at the B3LYP/6-31G (d, p) levels. As shown in Fig. S3a,† these polymers exhibit deep HOMO levels. Compared with PBDT-C4T, PBDT-F-C4T shows much lower HOMO levels, thanks to the strong electronegativity of the F atom. Among the three polymers, PBDT-SF-C4T shows the lowest HOMO energy levels because of the synergistic effect of the F and S atoms. Besides, the distance of intramolecular noncovalent S⋯F and S⋯O interactions was established by single crystal structure analysis performed at the B3LYP/6-31G (d, p) levels. As shown in Fig. S3b,† the distances of S⋯F and S⋯O are 2.923 Å and 2.702 Å. In addition, as seen from the side view, due to the intramolecular noncovalent interaction of S⋯F and S⋯O, all the polymers have a planar π-backbone structure, benefiting to improve the crystallinity and molecular packing for charge transport along the extended π conjugation path. The electrochemical properties of the copolymers measured by cyclic voltammetry (CV) are shown in Fig. 1d and S4.† The LUMO levels of PBDT-C4T, PBDT-F-C4T, PBDT-SF-C4T and IT-4F are −3.59, −3.61, −3.65 and −4.17 eV, while the HOMO levels are −5.58, −5.63, −5.66 and −5.71 eV, respectively. The deep HOMO levels of these copolymers can guarantee a high Voc value of the resulting devices, especially for PBDT-F-C4T and PBDT-SF-C4T. The trend of the energy levels of these polymers is also in accordance with the result of DFT simulations.
Non-fullerene OSC devices were fabricated using an inverted ITO/ZnO/polymers:IT-4F/MoO3/Ag architecture. ZnO and MoO3 were introduced as the interlayers. A series of different conditions have been used to optimize the device performance (detailed parameters in Table S2–5 and Fig. S5–8†). It is found that adding 0.5% DIO has more of an effect on the device performance than thermal annealing treatment. More importantly, these polymers can be well processed by the non-halogenated solvent TMB to achieve high efficiencies with high Voc values. Fig. 2a shows the optimized current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the devices. Fig. 2b shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of these optimized devices. Without the DIO additive, the polymer PBDT-F-C4T achieves the best performance among these three polymers. Note that a notable Voc of 0.90 V for PBDT-C4T, 0.98 V for PBDT-F-C4T and 0.99 V for PBDT-SF-C4T are achieved, due to their deep HOMO levels. The increasing tendency of the Voc value is in agreement with the variation of the HOMO levels of these copolymers. The Voc value can reflect the energy loss Eloss (Eloss = Egopt − eVoc) in the OSCs devices. Here, the IT-4F Egopt is 1.5 eV; thus the Eloss values of PBDT-C4T, PBDT-F-C4T and PBDT-SF-C4T are 0.60 eV, 0.52 eV and 0.51 eV, respectively. Both PBDT-F-C4T and PBDT-SF-C4T show much smaller Eloss values than the theoretical value (0.6–0.7 eV).57–59 In addition, the Voc of 0.99 V for PBDT-SF-C4T:IT-4F is the highest value of OSCs based on IT-4F to date, as revealed by the summarized data in Fig. 2c and Table S1.†

When adding 0.5% DIO additive, all devices exhibit better device performance (see Table 2), due to the remarkably improved Jsc and FF which should be related to the improved microphase morphology of the active blends. The PCE is improved from 6.74% to 7.91% for PBDT-C4T:IT-4F, from 11.2% to 12.5% for PBDT-F-C4T:IT-4F and from 6.84% to 9.91% for PBDT-SF-C4T:IT-4F. Apparently, PBDT-F-C4T-based devices with and without additives both yield the highest performance, resulting from the highest Jsc and FF. Fig. 2d and Table S6† summarize the efficiency of recently reported OSCs processed using green solvents. Clearly, the PCE of 12.5% achieved for PBDT-F-C4T:IT-4F is one of the best performances for green-solvent-processed OSCs reported to date. Although the Voc values of the DIO treated devices are slightly reduced, 0.94 V for PBDT-F-C4T:IT-4F and 0.95 V for PBDT-SF-C4T:IT-4F are still maintained. In order to further evaluate the validity of new developed polymer donor in the improvement of the Voc value when blended with other types of acceptors, more devices based on PBDT-F-C4T with different acceptors were fabricated. The devices exhibit a notably high Voc value, showing 1.15 V for PBDT-F-C4T:ITIC, 1.12 V for PBDT-F-C4T:ITIC-Th, 1.01 V for PBDT-F-C4T:ITIC-Th1, and even 0.93 V for PBDT-F-C4T:Y6. The J–V curves of different NFAs are displayed in Fig. S5.†

From Table 1 we can see that the polymer PBDT-SF-C4T has the best light capturing ability, but does not obtain the highest Jsc and PCE. Fig. 2b shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of these optimized devices. A broad respond range from 300–800 nm is found for all devices, and there is an apparent contrast between the devices with and without 0.5% DIO. Additive-treated devices show higher EQE values than additive-free ones. More importantly, among the devices with and without 0.5% DIO, PBDT-F-C4T obtained the highest EQE value, contributing to the highest Jsc. Note that the high Jsc value is obtained along with such a high Voc value. Therefore, a trade-off between Jsc and Voc is effectively suppressed. The Jsc values of these polymers are in agreement with those from the J–V measurement.
The charge generation and extraction of the OSCs were studied by the photocurrent density (Jph; Jph = Jlight − Jdark) versus effective voltage (Veff; Veff = V0 − Vappl, where V0 represents the voltage when Jph is 0 and Vappl is the applied voltage).60 As shown in Fig. 3a, the exciton dissociation probabilities (Pdiss = Jph/Jsat) of the PBDT-C4T:IT-4F devices are calculated to be 83% and 89% for the as-cast devices and the devices with 0.5% DIO under short-circuit and maximum power points, respectively. For PBDT-F-C4T:IT-4F blends, the Pdiss values are calculated to be 91% and 97% for the as-cast devices and the devices with 0.5% DIO, respectively (see Fig. 3b). The higher Pdiss values of PBDT-F-C4T:IT-4F indicates more exciton dissociation and extraction efficiencies in devices, which is beneficial for achieving a higher Jsc. However, for PBDT-SF-C4T:IT-4F blends, the Pdiss value is reduced to 85% in the as-cast devices and 88% in 0.5% DIO device (see Fig. 3c), leading to the inferior Jsc compared to the PBDT-F-C4T:IT-4F counterpart. Fig. 3d exhibits the light intensity dependence of Jsc. The charge recombination mechanism in OSCs was mainly affected by the light intensity (P) and Jsc. The corresponding equation can be estimated with log(Jsc) ∝ log(Plight)α, where α is a power-law exponent between Jsc and P. We can see that α values of all these polymers are close to 1, which suggests smaller trap-assisted recombination in the devices.61

The LUMO offsets between the polymer donor and the acceptor (ΔELUMO) of PBDT-C4T, PBDT-F-C4T, and PBDT-SF-C4T are 0.58, 0.56 and 0.52 eV, which are sufficient for electron transfer. However, PBDT-F-C4T and PBDT-SF-C4T show very deep HOMO levels, even equivalent to that of the IT-4F acceptor. The ΔEHOMO values of PBDT-C4T, PBDT-F-C4T, and PBDT-SF-C4T are 0.13, 0.08 and 0.05 eV, respectively. To evaluate whether such a low driving force can effectively separate the excitons, the charge dissociation of photocurrent conversion was studied by steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy. The PL spectra of the polymer donors PBDT-C4T, PBDT-F-C4T, and PBDT-SF-C4T, acceptor IT-4F film and their blend films were measured at different excitation wavelengths. The excitation wavelengths of the three neat films of PBDT-C4T, PBDT-F-C4T and PBDT-SF-C4T are 530, 540 and 545 nm, respectively, and that of the acceptor IT-4F is 715 nm. As shown in Fig. 4a–c, the emissions of PBDT-F-C4T and PBDT-SF-C4T are both completely quenched by IT-4F, implying that the electrons can be transfer efficiently to IT-4F. However, the emission of PBDT-C4T is not completely quenched by IT-4F, leading to the lowest Jsc. Delightfully, for all the blend films, PL emission of IT-4F at 715 nm is completely quenched by the donors. It suggests that the holes can well transfer from the acceptor to all polymer donors. Note that such a small ΔEHOMO of PBDT-F-C4T (0.08 eV) and PBDT-SF-C4T (0.05 eV) still provide sufficient driving force for efficient hole transfer. As a result, a high Jsc is obtained with a high Voc. Fig. 4d shows the time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) of the blend films. The fluorescence lifetime (τ) of the PBDT-F-C4T:IT-4F (184 ps) blend film is shorter than that of PBDT-C4T:IT-4F (309 ps) and PBDT-SF-C4T:IT-4F (207 ps). The result suggests that a higher proportion of photoinduced charges of the blend film PBDT-F-C4T:IT-4F has been transferred than for the other two counterparts.

To study the three polymers' surface and morphologies in the device, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements were performed. The AFM height images of the pure films are displayed in Fig. S9† and those of their blend films are shown in Fig. S10.† The AFM phase images are displayed in Fig. S11.† We can see that the pure films and blend films displayed a smooth and uniform surface. The root-mean-square (RMS) roughness values of the blend films were 0.7–1.0 nm. After adding 0.5% DIO, these blend films show a rougher surface. This is because the DIO additive can properly inhibit the compatibility between polymers and IT-4F. From the TEM images (Fig. 5a–f), the blend films PBDT-C4T:IT-4F and PBDT-SF-C4T:IT-4F show strong phase aggregation with a big domain size, which inhibits charge generation and transportation. However, PBDT-F-C4T:IT-4F shows much more homogeneous morphology and exhibits a fiber structure with 0.5% DIO additive. The phase separation behavior with more bi-continuous nano-scale networks for PBDT-F-C4T:IT-4F without or with 0.5% DIO can efficiently separate the excitons at the donor and acceptor interfaces, which helps to achieve a higher Jsc and FF. Moreover, the morphology also impacts the hole and electron mobility. The electron and hole mobilities were investigated by the space charge-limited current (SCLC) method.62 As shown in Fig. S12a, b† and Table 2, PBDT-F-C4T:IT-4F shows a higher hole motility (μh) of 2.3 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and electron motility (μe) of 2.7 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 than PBDT-C4T:IT-4F and PBDT-SF-C4T:IT-4F. After adding 0.5% DIO, the μh and μe of PBDT-F-C4T:IT-4F are improved to 2.7 × 10−4 and 2.9 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and a more balanced μe/μh of 1.07 is achieved. These results suggested that the improved mobilities and more balanced μe/μh value contribute to the higher Jsc and FF values with 0.5% DIO.

In order to further understand the molecular interchain ordering and orientation textures of the neat and blend films, grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) was performed. As shown in Fig. 6a and b, all these polymer neat films have strong lamellar (100) scattering along the in-plane (IP) directions at the position qxy = 0.24–0.26 Å−1 and strong interchain π–π stacking (010) scattering along the out of plane (OOP) direction at the position qz = 1.66–1.69 Å−1. These results imply that these polymers have a predominant “face-on” orientation, ascribed to the planar structure favored by noncovalent interactions. Such a “face-on” orientation is very desirable for charge transport. We also calculated the FWHM of the OOP (010) scattering and coherence lengths (CCLs) of the OOP (010) scattering (the detailed parameters are provided in the ESI Table S7†). The FWHM values of OOP (010) scattering values for PBDT-C4T, PBDT-F-C4T and PBDT-SF-C4T are 0.23 Å−1, 0.22 Å−1 and 0.29 Å−1 and the corresponding CCL (010) values are 24.6 Å, 25.3 Å and 22.7 Å. Thus, the narrowest (010) FWHM and larger (010) CCL of PBDT-F-C4T among these neat films suggested that the PBDT-F-C4T film has the best molecular packing. After blending with IT-4F, similar results also were observed for the copolymer:IT-4F blend films. As seen from Fig. 6a and b, compared to neat polymer films, all the blend films still retain the strong 100 scattering peak along the IP direction and strong π–π stacking (010) scattering peak along the OOP direction; after blending with IT-4F, the blend films still show a face-on orientation with π–π stacking in the out of plane direction and lamellar packing in the in-plane direction. Note that PBDT-F-C4T shows the strongest face-on signals for both neat and blended films. Such a favorable morphology of the bulk heterojunction endowed PBDT-F-C4T:IT-4F devices with the highest Jsc, FF and PCE.

Conclusions
In conclusion, three novel polymers PBDT-C4T, PBDT-F-C4T and PBDT-SF-C4T are developed for efficient OSCs. The polymers with F or S atom modified BDT exhibit very deep HOMO energy levels, achieving a high Voc of 0.98 V for PBDT-F-C4T:IT-4F and 0.99 V for PBDT-SF-C4T:IT-4F. Note that 0.99 V is the highest Voc for devices based on IT-4F to date. More importantly, S⋯F and S⋯O intramolecular noncovalent interactions in these copolymers favor a compact molecular packing with preferential face-on orientation. As a result, the PBDT-F-C4T:IT-4F blend achieves the highest PCE of 12.5% with simultaneously high Voc and Jsc values, when processed from a non-halogenated solvent, which is one of the best performances for non-halogenated-solvent-processed OSCs reported to date. These results demonstrate that the synergistic effect of the energy band structure and molecular geometry can provide an effective molecular design strategy for high performance OSCs.
