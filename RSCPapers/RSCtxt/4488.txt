    AbstractWe investigate the influence of electrolyte cations such as lithium and dimethylimidazolium on the spectroscopic and electrical characteristics of dye-sensitized solar cells based on a metal-free chromophore C218. An evident bathochromic effect of lithium with respect to dimethylimidazolium is noticed for the C218 dye-coated nanocrystalline titania film via measuring electronic absorption and photocurrent action spectra. In comparison with dimethylimidazolium, the use of lithium as the electrolyte cation evokes a downward shift of the excited-state redox potential of the C218 sensitizer by 120 mV, and that of the conduction band edge of the nanocrystalline TiO2 film by 390 meV. The resultant remarkable variation in the energy alignment at the titania/dye interface brings on dissimilar electron injection yields as revealed by transient emission measurements. Modulating the titania surface states distribution with lithium relative to dimethylimidazolium induces a slightly declining electron diffusion coefficient in the mesoporous titania film. However, the adsorption of lithium cations on titania strongly retards the interfacial charge recombination compared to dimethylimidazolium, contributing to an over one order of magnitude of enhancement of electron diffusion length. The improvement of electron diffusion length has a noticeable effect on the charge collection yield, which can also be observed by measuring monochromatic incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiencies. Further interface engineering is needed to enhance both the photovoltage and photocurrent, making use of the full power of metal-free organic dyes.

Broader context
In the past two decades, tremendous research efforts have been devoted to dye-sensitized solar cells in striving for a cost-effective photovoltaic technology. In view of the limited ruthenium supply, metal-free organic photosensitizers may play a momentous role in the coming large-scale application of dye-sensitized solar cells with a favorable performance to price ratio. However, there is still a moderate efficiency gap between ruthenium and metal-free organic dyes, which could be quickly filled by molecular engineering of new chromophores and modulation of electrolyte components. In this paper, we employed photophysical and electrical impedance techniques to scrutinize the electrolyte cation influence of lithium versus dimethylimidazolium on organic dye-sensitized solar cells, with a close look at light absorption, electron injection, charge collection, conduction band edge movement and distribution of density of states in the mesoporous titania film.

1. Introduction
The dye-sensitized solar cell (DSC) technology1 is emerging as one of the most appealing options for cost-effective conversion of solar energy to electrical power in the desired low-carbon economy. Following light absorption by organic small molecules grafted on a mesoporous titania film, ultrafast charge separation arises at the energy-offset titania/dye interface. Photoinduced electrons need to traverse through a micrometer-thick nanocrystalline film and arrive at the current collector, before the occurrence of charge recombination with oxidized dye molecules or triiodide ions in a redox electrolyte. Critical steps towards power generation all take place at the titania/dye/electrolyte interface, which is presently the focus of extensive research into device operation. Amongst the various strategies on tuning interface behavior, one prevailing way is the modulation of electrolyte compositions, where both anions and cations can play a momentous role in cell performance, through imposing their influence on interfacial charge transfer,2–9 electron transport10 and distribution of surface states.11
With a view to the limited supply of ruthenium, metal-free organic dyes have attracted considerable attention in recent years owing to their excellent flexibility in terms of molecular tailoring.12 In order to catch up with the efficiency achieved by ruthenium sensitizers, it is pertinent to smartly design more powerful organic chromophores and insightfully analyze the complicated interactions among titania, dye and electrolyte components. In this work, we study the profound impact of cations on the photocurrent action spectra and photocurrent–voltage characteristics of organic dye-sensitized solar cells, by constructing two simple electrolytes composed of lithium or dimethylimidazolium ions, apart from the iodide/triiodide redox couple and the acetonitrile solvent. Herein neither routine additives such as 4-tert-butylpyridine and guanidinium thiocyanate nor double-layer titania films for high-efficiency testing cells are applied so as to simplify analysis.
The intrinsic origins of some distinguishable photovoltaic features will be further scrutinized based upon measurements of steady-state and transient absorption, transient emission, and electrical impedance, with an overall analysis involving: (1) light absorption, (2) electron injection, (3) electron recombination with dye cations, (4) dye regeneration with iodide ions, (5) electron recombination with triiodide ions, (6) electron transport and distribution of surface states in the dye-coated mesoporous titania film, as clearly shown in Fig. 1A. Our preliminary work has suggested that the cation effects reported here are general for couples of organic chromophores with the triarylamine donor and the cyanoacrylic acid acceptor. Thereby, the C218 dye (Fig. 1B) used as a model photosensitizer in our group was selected for systematic studies.

2. Experimental
2.1. Materials
Acetonitrile (AN) and chlorobenzene were both distilled before use. Lithium iodide (LiI), lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) and iodine were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used without further purification. The synthesis of the C218 sensitizer and its aldehyde precursor was described in our previous paper.13 1,3-Dimethylimidazolium iodide (DMII) and dimethylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (DMITFSI) were prepared according to literature procedures.14
2.2. UV-vis and voltammetric measurements
Electronic absorption spectra were recorded on a UNICO spectrometer. A CHI660C electrochemical workstation was used for cyclic voltammetric measurements in combination with a three-electrode electrochemical cell equipped with a platinum gauze as counter electrode and a Ag/AgCl (sat. KCl) auxiliary electrode. The C218-coated titania on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) was used as the working electrode. The redox potentials reported in this paper were calibrated with ferrocene as the internal reference (−5.14 V versus vacuum).
2.3. Cell fabrication
A 7 μm thick, screen-printed film of interconnected 22 nm sized TiO2 particles on the FTO (TEC 15 Ω/□, Libbey-Owens-Ford Industries, 2.2 mm thick) conducting glass was used as the negative electrode. The film thickness was measured by a bench-top Ambios XP-1 stylus profilometer. The detailed preparation procedures of TiO2 nanocrystals, the paste for screen-printing and the nanostructured TiO2 film were reported in a previous paper.15 A cycloidal TiO2 electrode (∼0.28 cm2) was stained by immersing it into a dye solution containing 150 μM C218 in chlorobenzene for 5 h. After washing with acetonitrile and drying by air flow, the dye-coated titania electrode was assembled with a thermally platinized FTO electrode. The electrodes were separated by a 30 μm thick Bynel (DuPont) hot-melt gasket and sealed up by heating. The internal space was filled with a liquid electrolyte using a vacuum back filling system. The electrolyte-injecting hole on the counter electrode, made with a sand-blasting drill, was sealed with a Bynel sheet and a thin glass cover by heating. Electrolyte E1: 1.0 M LiI and 20 mM iodine in AN; E2: 1.0 M DMII and 20 mM iodine in AN. Note that iodine will react with iodide to form triiodide mainly.
2.4. Photovoltaic characterization
A Keithley 2400 source meter and a Zolix Omni-λ300 monochromator equipped with a 500 W xenon lamp were used for photocurrent action spectrum measurements, with a wavelength sampling interval of 10 nm and a current sampling time of 2 s under full computer control. Monochromatic incident photon-to-collected electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) is defined by IPCE(λ) = hcJsc/eϕλ, where h is the Planck constant, c is the light speed in a vacuum, e is the electronic charge, λ is the wavelength, Jsc is the short-circuit photocurrent density and ϕ is the incident radiative flux. A Hamamatsu S1337-1010BQ silicon diode used for IPCE measurements was calibrated at the National Institute of Metrology, China. During the photocurrent action spectrum measurements, a white light-emitting diode was used to bias a testing cell with ∼1.0 mA cm−2 background current. A model LS1000-4S-AM1.5G-1000W solar simulator (Solar Light Company, USA) in combination with a metal mesh was employed to give an irradiance of 100 mW cm−2. The light intensity was tested with a PMA2144 pyranometer and a calibrated PMA 2100 dose control system. Current–voltage (J–V) characteristics were obtained by applying a potential bias to a testing cell and measuring the photocurrent with a Keithley 2602 source meter under full computer control. The measurements were fully automated using Labview 8.0. A metal mask with an aperture area of 0.158 cm2 was covered on a testing cell during all measurements. An antireflection film (λ<380 nm, ARKTOP, ASAHI Glass) was adhered to the DSC photoanode during IPCE and J–V measurements. The short-circuit photocurrent densities measured under this solar simulator are consistent with the integral of IPCEs over the AM1.5G spectrum (ASTM G173-03), within a 5% error.
2.5. Transient emission and absorption measurements
Time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) measurements were performed on a LifeSpec-II fluorescence spectrometer equipped with an EPL635 laser diode. Transient absorption measurements were carried out with a LP920 laser flash spectrometer in conjunction with a nanosecond tunable OPOLett-355II laser. The sample was kept at a 45° angle to the excitation beam. The probe light from a pulsed xenon arc lamp was passed through various optical elements, sample and a monochromator before being detected by a fast photomultiplier tube and recorded with a TDS 3012C digital signal analyzer.
2.6. Electrical impedance measurements
Electrical impedance experiments were performed under the illumination of a red light-emitting diode on an IM6ex electrochemical workstation, with a frequency range from 50 mHz to 100 kHz and a potential modulation of 20 mV. A potential bias (V) was applied to equal the open-circuit photovoltage (Voc) at each irradiation intensity, meeting the requirement of zero current. The obtained impedance spectra were fitted with the Z-view software (v2.80, Scribner Associates Inc.).
3. Results and discussion
Measuring IPCE is a powerful approach to evaluate light absorption, net charge separation and carrier collection of dye-sensitized solar cells. If all the photons of a certain wavelength are absorbed to generate free charge carriers, which then traverse through the active layer to the current collector, the IPCE at that particular wavelength has a value of unity. Photocurrent action spectra of our cells employing a lithium electrolyte (E1) or dimethylimidazolium electrolyte (E2) are shown in Fig. 2A. A remarkable ∼50 nm bathochromic shift of the photocurrent onset wavelength was observed for the lithium electrolyte-filled cell with respect to the dimethylimidazolium counterpart.

(B) Absorptivities of cells with electrolytes E1 and E2 and their corresponding analogues with 1.0 M LiTFSI and DMITFSI in AN. E1: 1.0 M LiI and 20 mM I2 in AN. E2: 1.0 M DMII and 20 mM I2 in AN. A 7 μm thick TiO2 film was used for cell fabrication. Cells were tested using a metal mask with an aperture area of 0.158 cm2. 
We further measured the electronic absorptions of C218-coated titania films in contact with acetonitrile and some electrolyte salts. In contrast with acetonitrile alone, the dimethylimidazolium electrolyte E2 caused a very small red-shifting as depicted in Fig. S1†. However, the presence of lithium cations in acetonitrile (E1) significantly red-shifts the absorption peak. We notice that this bathochromic shift is mainly attributed to the cation effect rather than the cooperative influence of cations and anions. As presented in Fig. 2B, a very small impact is observed on light absorption by replacing iodide and triiodide with bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide. We suspect that this bathochromic effect could stem from a strong interaction of lithium ions with dye molecules, most probably on the carbonyl oxygen site.2 Further electronic absorption measurements (Fig. S2†) of solutions made from the aldehyde precursor of C218 also support this assumption. The optical energy gap can be roughly evaluated by taking the onset wavelength with an absorptivity (S) of 1% in Fig. 2B, being 810 and 752 nm for cells with electrolytes based on LiTFSI and DMITFSI, which afford optical energy gaps of 1.53 eV and 1.65 eV, respectively. Apparently, the optical energy gap of the C218-stained film in the lithium electrolyte was narrowed by 0.12 eV with respect to that in the dimethylimidazolium counterpart, which is consistent with the photocurrent action spectrum extension illustrated in Fig. 2A.
We also analyzed the photocurrent action spectra to look at the influence of cations on the charge collection yield. Taking into account that IPCE(λ) = ηlh(λ) × Φcs × ηcoll(λ), where the net charge separation efficiency (Φcs) is normally considered to be wavelength-independent in DSCs, we first normalized the IPCE with respect to absorptivity (S), removing the contribution from the light harvesting efficiency (ηlh(λ)). Further normalization of IPCEλ/Sλ relative to IPCE500/S500 eliminates the distinction in the net charge separation efficiency of cells with electrolytes E1 and E2, and thus reveals the characteristics of charge collection efficiency (ηcoll(λ)), which may change with excitation energy because of wavelength-dependent light penetration length. Therefore, we can derive from Fig. 3 that in contrast to the cell with electrolyte E1, the charge collection yield for the E2 cell is not quantitative in the wavelength range between 520 and 680 nm.
 Fig. 3  Wavelength-dependent ratio of IPCE to absorptivity (IPCEλ/Sλ), which was divided by the value at 500 nm (IPCE500/S500) for normalization. 
The remarkable difference in IPCE maxima (Fig. 2A) gives an essential implication of the cation effect on net charge separation efficiency. We first employed the transient absorption technique2,8,16,17 to scrutinize the electron-transfer kinetic competition between channels 3 and 4 as illustrated in Fig. 1A. The absorption traces shown in Fig. 4 were fitted by a stretched exponential decay function to afford the half-life time (t1/2). In the presence of TFSI electrolytes, the decay of signals at 780 nm, which stem from the absorption of dye cations, could be ascribed to the electron-transfer channel 3. The t1/2 for the LiTFSI electrolyte is 120 μs, significantly shorter than that of 670 μs for DMITFSI. When iodide takes the place of TFSI, the decay of the absorption signals at 780 nm is significantly accelerated, owing to the occurrence of channel 4. The half-life times of dye regeneration are 6 and 17 μs for cells with electrolytes containing LiI and DMII, respectively. Although the electron transfer kinetics of both channel 3 and channel 4 are faster in the presence of lithium cations relative to dimethylimidazolium, their branch ratios are both over 20. Thereby, we conclude that the cation-dependent kinetics of dye regeneration and charge recombination of dye cations with electrons from titania do not make a decisive contribution to the aforementioned large discrepancy in IPCE heights.

(B) Absorption change of a C218-coated titania film immersed in acetonitrile containing 1.0 M LiI or DMII. Absorbance changes were measured at a probe wavelength of 780 nm upon laser excitation (7 ns full width half-maximum pulse duration, 2 Hz repetition rate). The used pulse fluences and excitation wavelengths were: LiTFSI, 27.3 μJ cm−2 at 681 nm; DMITFSI, 29.1 μJ cm−2 at 643 nm; LiI, 27.3 μJ cm−2 at 684 nm; DMII, 29.1 μJ cm−2 at 637 nm. The excitation wavelengths and pulse fluences were carefully selected to ensure that during every laser pulse, (1.25–1.28) × 1013 photons cm−2 were absorbed by a C218-coated titania film immersed in different acetonitrile solutions, in terms of a ∼0.29 OD absorbance with a light incident angle of 45°. The smooth lines are stretched exponential fittings over raw data obtained by averaging 3000 laser shots. 
We further resorted to the TCSPC technique to determine the electron injection yield, which is another crucial parameter in the practical operation of DSCs.4,18,19 We first employed a C218-coated ZrO2 film and electrolyte E2 to construct a reference dummy cell, featuring a strong emission upon laser excitation at 639 nm. The green decay trace shown in Fig. 5 can be ascribed to the irradiative and non-irradiative deactivation of excited dye molecules grafted on zirconia. Electron injection is not considered to be a non-irradiative deactivation channel due to the absence of a favorable energy offset at the ZrO2/dye interface (the excited-state redox potential of C218: −3.79 V versus vacuum; the conduction band edge (Ec) of ZrO2: −3.41 eV versus vacuum).20 Furthermore, energy transfer is not possible due to a smaller energy gap of C218 dye (1.65 eV) than that of wide-band-gap zirconia (5.00 eV). However, the emission intensity (I) is considerably reduced by simply replacing zirconia with titania, indicating the occurrence of electron injection from excited dye molecules to TiO2. Through integrating the emission trace of the dye-coated TiO2 film relative to that of ZrO2, we calculated the electron injection efficiency (ηinj) to be 81% in the case of electrolyte E2. However, the replacement of electrolyte E2 with E1 promotes a further decrease in the emission intensity, resulting in an almost 100% electron injection yield. It can be concluded that in contrast to the lithium electrolyte, the imidazolium counterpart could not guarantee a quantitative electron injection yield at the titania/dye interface, soundly explaining the above-observed difference in IPCE maxima.
 Fig. 5  Normalized decay traces of photoluminescence from a C218-coated ZrO2 film immersed in electrolyte E2, and C218-coated TiO2 films immersed in electrolyte E1 or E2. Excitation wavelength: 639 nm. Detection wavelength: 710 nm. The emission intensities have been corrected in terms of the absorbance at 639 nm. 
We suspect that the contrast in ηinj could stem from the cation-induced variation in the energy alignment at the titania/dye interface. As shown in Fig. S3†, the ground-state redox potential versus vacuum of C218 coated on titania was measured to be −5.44 V regardless of the presence of lithium or dimethylimidazolium cations. Considering the aforementioned optical energy gaps with the corresponding electrolytes, we derived the excited-state redox potentials to be −3.91 V and −3.79 V for C218 immersed in the lithium and dimethylimidazolium electrolytes, respectively, with a cation-dependent variation of 0.12 V. As will be detailed in the subsequent electrical impedance analysis, the Ec of the nanocrystalline titania film immersed in the lithium electrolyte E1 is downward shifted by 0.39 eV compared to that in the dimethylimidazolium electrolyte, which supplies a more favorable driving force for faster electron injection even considering the difference in excited-state redox potentials.
The photovoltaic performance was evaluated by measuring the J–V characteristics (Fig. 6) under irradiation of AM1.5G full sunlight. The lithium electrolyte endows a cell with a considerably increased short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) of 16.63 mA cm−2, in contrast to the dimethylimidazolium counterpart of 10.86 mA cm−2. This observation is consistent with the preceding IPCE data. However, the replacement of dimethylimidazolium with lithium in the redox electrolyte leads to a ∼250 mV reduction in the open-circuit photovoltage (Voc) and a diminished fill factor (FF) from 0.758 to 0.466. These adverse effects from lithium ions overcompensate the photocurrent gain, resulting in a lower power conversion efficiency of 3.67% compared to 6.01% for dimethylimidazolium. The observed poor performance here has also highlighted the importance of electrolyte engineering in our previous publication.13

A 7 μm thick TiO2 film was used for cell fabrication. Cells were tested using a metal mask with an aperture area of 0.158 cm2. 
We carried out electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS)21–23 measurements under illumination to understand the intrinsic origins of the remarkable Voc difference, and scrutinize the electron transport process. The EIS spectra were fitted with a proper equivalent circuit24,27 as illustrated by Fig. S4† and the fitted parameters are presented in Fig. 7A and 8.
 Fig. 7  (A) Plots of Rt in the nanocrystalline titania film versus (EF,n − EF,redox). The data points were derived from EIS, while the solid lines were fittings in terms of eqn (1). The value of R0 was calculated with an electron mobility (μn) of 1.0 cm2 V−1 s−1, Nc of 7.0 × 1020 cm−3, film thickness of 7 μm, cell area of 0.2826 cm2 and porosity of 0.64 to afford a R0 of 6.14 × 10−5 Ω for the titania film utilized. (B) Plots of DOS against titania electron energy level. The top energy level of the DOS profile corresponds to the Voc under irradiation of 100 mW cm−2 AM1.5G sunlight. The red and blue dotted lines refer to the EcversusEF,redox for the C218-coated TiO2 film immersed in electrolytes E1 and E2, respectively. The intersection of the green dashed line with the horizontal axis corresponds to a DOS of 8.0 × 1018 cm−3 V−1. EcLiI and EcDMII refer to the conduction band edges of titania films in contact with electrolytes E1 and E2. ELiI and EDMII represent the corresponding quasi-Fermi levels corresponding to DOS = 8.0 × 1018 cm−3 V−1. ΔEc is the conduction band edge gap.

The data points are fitted data from EIS and the solid lines are fittings in terms of appropriate functions. 
Lithium cations are known to downward shift the conduction band edge of metal oxide semiconductors.25,26 Herein the modulated Ec of TiO2 can be numerically obtained by analyzing the transport resistance (Rt)27 (1)wherein kB is the Boltzmann constant and T the absolute temperature. R0 denotes the transport resistance on the transport level and is considered to be constant for the two cells. Note that the Voc of DSCs under irradiation is equal to the difference between the titania Fermi-level (EF,n) and the electrolyte Fermi-level (EF,redox). As shown in Fig. 7A, fitting the Rt data gave slopes of −32 and −36 V−1 in the semi-logarithmic plots of the corresponding cells with electrolytes E1 and E2, while the theoretical slope is −39 V−1 based on natural logarithm treatment. Calculation using the fitted intercepts afforded (Ec − EF,redox) of 0.56 and 0.95 eV for cells with electrolytes E1 and E2, respectively, revealing that lithium cations bring down the Ec by 0.39 eV compared to dimethylimidazolium. This information can be exactly integrated with the density of states (DOS) profile to give a schematic energy diagram as visualized in Fig. 7B, where Ec is marked out versusEF,redox.
Interfacial charge recombination with triiodide can noticeably influence the open-circuit voltage, thereby we further investigated this process with the aid of impedance spectroscopy. Considering the nonlinear recombination under quasi-static conditions, the apparent electron lifetime is28 (2)wherein nt and nc refer to the electron density in the trap states and that in the conduction band, respectively, and τf is the free carrier lifetime, which is defined as28 (3)In eqn (3)γ denotes the nonlinear recombination coefficient, and k0 represents a recombination rate constant with a dimension of cm−3(1 − γ) s−1. n0 is the equilibrium electron concentration given by (4) wherein Nc is the total volume density of accessible states in the conduction band. Furthermore, (5)wherein Nt is the total volume density of accessible states in the bandgap, and α = T/Tc, which is a characteristic parameter describing the distribution profile of trap states. Assuming that nt ≫ nc and only electrons in the trap states contribute to the apparent chemical capacitance (Cμ), the recognized function for chemical capacitance is29 (6)
Fitting the chemical capacitance data in Fig. 8A with the Ec movement gives α and Nt. Integrating eqn (2) to (6) and taking into account the linear relationship between Cμ and DOS, the dependence of apparent electron lifetime on DOS turns out to be (7)
Fitting the recombination time versusDOS with α and Nt and a presumed Nc = 7.0 × 1020 cm−3 gives the recombination rate constant k0 numerically as 3.9 × 109 and 2.8 × 1010, and the nonlinear coefficient γ to be 0.48 and 0.56 for cells with lithium and dimethylimidazolium electrolytes, respectively. Assuming that the interfacial recombination primarily occurs through electron transfer from the conduction band, the recombination rate is Un = k0ncγ(8)wherein Un is the recombination rate and nc is determined by (9)
As an example, we selected a randomly given DOS of 8.0 × 1018 cm−3 V−1 and protracted a line from this chosen point to intersect with the two DOS profiles. The intersection afforded a state level which actually represents the quasi-Fermi level EF,nversusEF,redox for cells with electrolytes E1 and E2. We subsequently identified the energy barrier of (EF,n − Ec), that is, −0.31 and −0.28 eV for cells with the corresponding electrolytes E1 and E2, as explicitly depicted in Fig. 7B. The recombination rates under the open-circuit condition can be determined to be 1.2 × 1017 cm−3 s−1 and 2.9 × 1019 cm−3 s−1 for cells with electrolytes E1 and E2, respectively. At the randomly given density of states, lithium ions suppressed the recombination by a factor of ∼241 compared to dimethylimidazolium ions, explaining the sharp contrast in apparent electron lifetime in Fig. 8B.
The distribution profile of triiodide ions in the vicinity of titania is probably affected by the adsorbed lithium cations, which selectively attract iodide anions possessing a high negative charge density. The electrical double layer of lithium and iodide ions further expels the low-charge-density triiodide anions far from titania, efficiently extending the electron tunneling distance and thus leading to much slower interfacial charge-transfer kinetics. However, dimethylimidazolium cations may not tend to form a positive adsorption layer as a result of its weaker Lewis acidity.
The remarkable downward movement of the TiO2 conduction band edge is expected to bring down the Voc by as much as ∼390 mV. However, the significantly suppressed interfacial charge recombination and the bathochromic spectral response in the presence of lithium cations benefit the electron density buildup in the titania film, partly compensating the adverse effect of a band edge movement on Voc. The compromise of band edge shifts and modulated charge density collectively contribute to a Voc decrease of ∼250 mV in practical measurements.
The chemical diffusion coefficient (Dn)30 of electrons in the titania film is another critical parameter that affects the charge collection efficiency.31 It has been reported that when the titania semiconductor is appropriately doped or intercalated with lithium cations at a proper forward bias, Dn could manifest comparable changes with respect to the gap of τn, thus resulting in a negligible variation in the electron diffusion length (Ln).32 It is noteworthy that our study on cation/TiO2 interaction gives different observations. While the apparent electron lifetime exhibits an increase over 200 fold, the chemical diffusion coefficient with E1 only declines slightly compared to that with E2 at a given density of states, as shown in Fig. 8B and 8C. Replacing E2 with E1 apparently induces a noticeable change in the DOS distribution profile with a larger Tc (E1, 958 K; E2, 802 K). The larger Tc implies a broader DOS distribution as seen in Fig. 7B. The variation in the distribution width directly leads to different gaps between EF,n and Ec at a given density of states, as exemplified with the selected DOS of 8.0 × 1018 cm−3 V−1. We speculate that compared to dimethylimidazolium, lithium cations not only significantly shift the conduction band edges downwards, but also induce more deep surface states in the bandgap. In contrast, for the cell with the dimethylimidazolium electrolyte, a relatively diminished number of deep states tends to be favorable for the electron detrapping from a localized state to the conduction band with a reduced thermodynamic barrier, thus populating electrons in the shallow states below the conduction band edge and raising the quasi-Fermi level. This actually endows faster electron diffusion with an enriched electron density in the conduction band (nc). Moreover, a semi-quantitative treatment with the parameters concerning the chemical diffusion coefficient could help rationally to compare the cation effect on electron transport. Considering the multiple-trapping (MT) mechanism33,34 under quasi-static conditions, the apparent diffusion coefficient30 (10)wherein D0 represents the diffusion coefficient in the conduction band and typically depends on temperature but does not vary with the specific conduction band edge. Taking into account eqn (9) and (11)eqn (10) can also be written as (12)
To relatively compare the cation effect on electron transport, eqn (12) is used to construct (13)
To verify the validation of this relative comparison, we still employ the selected DOS at 8.0 × 1018 cm−3 V−1 which is located in the potential window under investigation. With parameters from Table S1† and the obtained (EF,n − Ec) gaps at this example DOS, one finds from eqn (13) that DE1n/DE2n = 0.41, which is quite close to the value of 0.6 calculated with data taken from the fittings in Fig. 8C. We note that the DOS distribution profile characterized by Tc essentially determines the (EF,n − Ec) gap at a given density of states.
The charge collection yield in DSCs is related to a series of parameters including the light absorption coefficient, film thickness, and electron diffusion length (Ln) which is defined as21 (14)Integrating eqn (7) and eqn (10) into eqn (14) affords the mathematical dependence of Ln on the density of states (15)which can be applied in the fittings of the experimental data shown in Fig. 8D.
The above analysis soundly confirms that the enhancement of the electron diffusion length is largely contributed by the retarded recombination, while the chemical diffusion of electrons imposes a moderately adverse effect on charge collection in the presence of lithium cations. EIS measurements reveal that in comparison with dimethylimidazolium, lithium cations can effectively prolong the electron diffusion length, as shown in Fig. 8D, which is in good agreement with the analysis of IPCEs in Fig. 3. We remark that while modulation of the distribution of surface states may enhance the apparent electron diffusion coefficient, special care has to be taken to control interfacial charge recombination.
Conclusions
To summarize, we have investigated the cation effects of lithium versus dimethylimidazolium on the spectroscopic and electrical characteristics of organic dye-sensitized solar cells, laying emphasis on light absorption, electron injection, charge collection, and conduction band edge movement of the mesoporous titania film as well as the distribution of the density of states. It has been found that lithium cations in an electrolyte can evidently red-shift the absorption spectra of some organic dye-coated mesoporous films and thereby make a significant contribution to the photocurrent enhancement. Photophysical and electrical impedance measurements have proved the advantageous effect of lithium cations on electron injection and charge collection in comparison with imidazolium ions. It is speculated that lithium cations tend to induce more deep surface states, adversely influencing the chemical diffusion coefficient in comparison to dimethylimidazolium. However, it seems that the adsorption of lithium cations onto titania strongly retards interfacial recombination, probably by considerably extending the electron tunneling distance with an electrical double layer composed of lithium and iodide ions. The slow charge recombination with triiodide appears to effectively compensate the shrinkage in the electron diffusion coefficient, ensuring a high charge collection yield. Unfortunately a remarkable downward movement of the titania conduction band edge by lithium ions noticeably exerts a negative impact on the open-circuit photovoltage. Systematic interface engineering is desirable to synchronously enhance the photovoltage and photocurrent, in order to take full advantage of the advancement of metal-free organic dyes.

Broader context
In the past two decades, tremendous research efforts have been devoted to dye-sensitized solar cells in striving for a cost-effective photovoltaic technology. In view of the limited ruthenium supply, metal-free organic photosensitizers may play a momentous role in the coming large-scale application of dye-sensitized solar cells with a favorable performance to price ratio. However, there is still a moderate efficiency gap between ruthenium and metal-free organic dyes, which could be quickly filled by molecular engineering of new chromophores and modulation of electrolyte components. In this paper, we employed photophysical and electrical impedance techniques to scrutinize the electrolyte cation influence of lithium versus dimethylimidazolium on organic dye-sensitized solar cells, with a close look at light absorption, electron injection, charge collection, conduction band edge movement and distribution of density of states in the mesoporous titania film.

The used pulse fluences and excitation wavelengths were: LiTFSI, 27.3 μJ cm−2 at 681 nm; DMITFSI, 29.1 μJ cm−2 at 643 nm; LiI, 27.3 μJ cm−2 at 684 nm; DMII, 29.1 μJ cm−2 at 637 nm. The excitation wavelengths and pulse fluences were carefully selected to ensure that during every laser pulse, (1.25–1.28) × 1013 photons cm−2 were absorbed by a C218-coated titania film immersed in different acetonitrile solutions, in terms of a ∼0.29 OD absorbance with a light incident angle of 45°.
