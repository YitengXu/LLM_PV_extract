    , Accepted 17th December 2019First published on 20th December 2019AbstractAs one of the most promising next-generation safe and green energy storage technologies, aqueous Zn-ion batteries have attracted considerable attention in recent years. However, their working mechanism is still controversial. Also, their performance needs to be further improved to meet the requirement of widespread applications. Herein, we developed a nanoflower-like MnO2/C composite with two-electron reaction pathway for use as a cathode material in aqueous Zn-ion batteries. Benefiting from the large specific surface area of the nanoflower-like structure, high conductivity of the carbon materials and the low crystallinity of birnessite-type MnO2, the Zn-ion battery using MnO2/C as the cathode material could carry out a deep and fast reaction via the Mn4+/Mn2+ two-electron pathway. At 300 mA g−1, the battery could retain a high specific capacity of 279.7 mA h g−1 after 300 cycles. The second electronic reaction process of Mn3+/Mn2+ could also work at a high current density. A high initial discharge capacity of more than 200 mA h g−1 was achieved at a high current density of 2000 mA g−1. A two-electron working mechanism of the layered-MnO2 cathode material is proposed. Due to the advantages of high capacity, high rate performance and good stability, the MnO2/C composite is a promising cathode material for aqueous Zn-ion batteries, which holds potential for applications in electric vehicles and grid energy storage.
Introduction
Due to the increasing environmental pollution caused by the long-term usage of fossil fuel, the establishment of low-carbon sustainable and green energy systems has attracted significant attention worldwide.1–4 However, due to the intermittentency of renewable energies, such as wind, solar and tidal energy, an energy storage system that is safe, green, economical and has large capacity and high power density is highly desired to maintain the continuity of energy supply and cope with the impact of peak demand for electricity on the energy system.5–7 Therefore, a new energy storage scheme is urgently needed to promote the usage of renewable energy. Due to the natural abundance of metals, compelling price and enhanced capacity storage performance, metal-ion batteries, such as sodium-ion, potassium-ion and zinc-ion batteries, have attracted widespread interest as promising alternatives for future large-scale energy storage devices.8–11
In recent years, owing to the low cost, high capacity (819 mA h g−1) and suitable redox potential of the Zn metal anode (−0.76 V vs. SHE) as well as the nonflammability, non-toxicity and high ionic conductivity of the aqueous electrolyte, aqueous Zn-ion batteries have been receiving increasing attention.12–15 Recently, manganese-based oxides,16–19 Prussian blue analogs,20–22 vanadium-based oxides,23–25 polyanion compounds,26 Chevrel phase compounds27 and quinone analogs28,29 have been reported for the storage of Zn2+. Among them, apart from the low cost, non-toxicity and high theoretical capacity (308 mA h g−1 produced through the Mn4+/Mn3+ pathway),30,31 MnO2 has superior properties for use as a cathode material for Zn-ion batteries. MnO2 shows different crystal structures, such as α-MnO2, β-MnO2, γ-MnO2, δ-MnO2 and spinel-type MnO2.32 Compared to MnO2 with a tunnel structure, metal ions or crystal water can exist in MnO2 with a layered crystal structure. Hence, layered MnO2 possesses a larger capacity and a higher diffusion rate of metal ions. Despite the significant progress achieved in rechargeable Zn–MnO2 batteries, the reaction mechanism is still controversial.33–35 Three relatively common charge storage mechanisms, namely the reversible insertion/extraction of Zn2+, the reversible H+ reaction accompanied by the precipitation of Zn4SO4(OH)6 and the reversible insertion/extraction of both H+ and Zn2+ at different charge/discharge stages, have been reported.12,36,37 In the study by Pan et al., MnO2 only gets converted into MnOOH during the discharge and the specific capacity is close to the theoretical capacity (308 mA h g−1) based on the one-electron reaction pathway.30 Wang et al. reported a mesoporous MnO2 flower-like cathode that could deliver a high reversible specific capacity.38 During the discharge, H+ gets inserted into MnO2 first, and then MnOOH is produced. Following this, the insertion of Zn2+ produced ZnMn2O4. Nevertheless, these mechanisms only utilize electrons during Mn4+/Mn3+ conversion, which limit the further increment in capacity. Thus, further study on the Zn–MnO2 battery reaction path is required to enhance the charge storage ability. Essentially, multivalent Mn (+2, +3, and +4) possesses greater potential in the two-electron Mn4+/Mn2+ reaction with a theoretical capacity of ∼616 mA h g−1, and it is expected that the capacity of the Zn–MnO2 battery can be further elevated via this reaction pathway.
In this study, a nanoflower-like MnO2/C composite was prepared for use as a cathode material in Zn-ion batteries, conducting a two-electron reaction pathway with excess specific capacity. The K+ and crystal water located between the MnO6 layers maintain the structural stability of MnO2 and the existence of crystal water is conducive to the insertion/extraction and diffusion of Zn2+, which is instrumental in raising the performance of the Zn–MnO2 battery at a high current density.39,40 MnO2 with lower crystallinity contains higher energy41 and may possess the ability to deepen the reaction depth (Mn4+/Mn3+ → Mn4+/Mn2+). The layered MnO2 is beneficial in enhancing the capacity of the Zn–MnO2 battery. As the matrix, the conductive carbon black (Super P) greatly improves the conductivity of MnO2. In addition, the in situ growth of MnO2 nanosheets on the Super P surface can effectively prevent the agglomeration of MnO2 and increase the reaction area of MnO2. The above characteristics are critical for the rapid reaction in the MnO2–Zn batteries and the two-electron reaction pathway with excess specific capacity.
Experimental section
Fabrication of nanoflower-like MnO2/C
MnO2 nanosheets were in situ grown on the surface of Super P to form a nanoflower-like MnO2/C composite via an ultrasonic-assisted synthesis. The synthesis route and reagents were the same as those used in our previous study.42 The products made using 0.1 M KMnO4, 0.2 M KMnO4 and 0.3 M KMnO4 with Super P were denoted as 0.1 MnO2/C, 0.2 MnO2/C and 0.3 MnO2/C, respectively. The calcined-MnO2 was produced via the thermal decomposition of KMnO4.43 The KMnO4 powder was heated at 350 °C for 5 h, and then was washed using deionized water several times after cooling. Ultimately, the product was dried at 100 °C for 12 h.
Material characterization
The crystal structure of the material was determined using an XRD diffractometer (Model: D/MAX-Ultima) equipped with a Cu-Kα radiation source (λ = 1.5406 Å) and operated at 40 kV and 30 mA in a 2-theta range of 10–70°. Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) was conducted on an SDT 2960 simultaneous DSC-TGA (TA Instruments) to record the weight loss in an air atmosphere from room temperature to 700 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. The morphology of the material was characterized via field-emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM, S-3400N) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Talos F200S). The N2 sorption experiments and BET surface area analysis were performed on a Micromeritics 3H-2000PS1 instrument. An elemental analysis for K and Mn was performed on a Thermo Fisher ICAP RQ inductively coupled plasma mass (ICP-MS) spectrometer.
Electrochemical measurements
The electrochemical properties of the samples were tested with CR2032 coin cells. The coin cells were assembled with a Zn plate as the anode, glass fiber as the separator and aqueous 2.0 M ZnSO4 + 0.5 M MnSO4 as the electrolyte unless otherwise stated. The cathode was prepared by the following procedure. Dough was made using a mixture of acetylene black:PTFE = 8:1:1 (weight ratio) with anhydrous ethanol as the solvent, and then rolled onto a stainless steel mesh (304, 100 mesh) through a roll press to form a membrane. Finally, the film was dried at 100 °C for 12 h and cut into ϕ12 sheets for use as the working electrodes, in which the areal density of the active material for the electrode was about 5 mg cm−2. The battery using 0.2 MnO2/C as the cathode was named as 0.2 MnO2/C–Zn battery, and the other batteries were also denoted in the similar way. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was applied to study the charge storage mechanism of the layered-MnO2. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed to measure the resistance of batteries at different states with an amplitude of 5 mV and a frequency range of 1 MHz to 0.1 Hz. The galvanostatic charge/discharge performance of the batteries was analyzed on a LAND battery testing system.
Results and discussion
The crystal structures of Super P, calcined-MnO2 and different MnO2/C samples were characterized via X-ray diffraction (XRD). In the range of 20–28° and 41.2–46.3°, Super P exhibited two flat peaks that correspond to the (002) and (100) faces (Fig. 1a), suggesting a low crystallinity. The XRD peaks of the calcined-MnO2 and different MnO2/C samples are in good agreement with that of the birnessite-MnO2 sample (JCPDS 80-1098); therefore, the calcined-MnO2 and different MnO2/C samples possess MnO2 with a layered structure. The crystal structure of 0.2 MnO2/C was further characterized via TEM. Fig. 1c displays a nanoflower-like morphology of the in situ grown MnO2 nanosheets on the Super P carbon sphere. The lattice fringes of 0.235 nm, 0.212 nm and 0.253 nm in Fig. 1d correspond to the lattice spacing in MnO2 (birnessite-type, JCPDS 80-1098) at the (003), (12), and (200) planes, which is well consistent with the XRD results in Fig. 1a. Moreover, the fuzzy space lattice and the FFT pattern (Fig. 1d, inset) reveal the poor crystallinity of 0.2 MnO2/C. The crystal model of birnessite-MnO2 is similar to the one shown in Fig. 1b.26 The calcined-MnO2 possesses high crystallinity as indicated by the sharp XRD peaks, while the MnO2 in MnO2/C samples has a nano-scale size and low crystallinity, leading to the widening of the diffraction peaks. The loading of MnO2 in the MnO2/C samples was analyzed via the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The TGA curves (Fig. S1†) indicate that the MnO2 loadings on 0.1 MnO2/C, 0.2 MnO2/C and 0.3 MnO2/C are 45.85%, 61.22% and 66.49%, respectively. Through the formula (1) and (2) presented in a ESI,† the molecular formulae of 0.1 MnO2/C (K0.28(H2O)0.16MnO2/C8.89), 0.2 MnO2/C (K0.34(H2O)0.24MnO2/C4.01), 0.3 MnO2/C (K0.36(H2O)0.23MnO2/C3.09) and calcined-MnO2 (K0.32MnO2) are obtained. Compared with the molecular formula K0.23(H2O)0.7MnO2 of the birnessite MnO2 (JCPDS 80-1098), MnO2/C samples contain more K+ and fewer crystal water. Therefore, due to the higher K+ content, the layer spacing of the (001) and (002) planes in calcined-MnO2 and MnO2/C samples increases, and the corresponding diffraction peaks shift to smaller angles than those found in the PDF cards.44

The morphology of Super P, calcined-MnO2 and different MnO2/C samples was characterized via SEM. Super P exists in the form of spherical carbon particles with a particle size of about 50 nm (Fig. 2a). After the MnO2in situ grown on the surface of Super P, the particle size of the MnO2/C samples (Fig. 2b–d) increase to circa 100 nm as compared to that of Super P. In addition, compared with the smooth surface of Super P, the surface of the MnO2/C samples are covered by hierarchical MnO2 nanosheets, presenting a nanoflower-like composite as a whole. This morphology is favorable for the uniform distribution of MnO2, which is beneficial to have full contact with the electrolyte and Super P and then to promote the battery reaction. The large particle size of about 100–500 nm of calcined-MnO2 with an irregular shape (Fig. 2e and f) impedes the increment of the reaction area and the reduction in the charge/discharge resistance of the battery. The specific surface area and pore size distribution of calcined-MnO2 and the MnO2/C samples were studied by N2 sorption experiments (Fig. S2†), and the detailed discussion is shown in the ESI.† Known from the result of the N2 sorption experiment, the specific surface area values of 0.1 MnO2/C (75.79 m2 g−1), 0.2 MnO2/C (66.23 m2 g−1) and 0.3 MnO2/C (61.46 m2 g−1) are much larger than that of calcined-MnO2 (17.59 m2 g−1). It is mainly attributed to the nanoflower-like structure. In addition, MnO2 is staggered in a lamellar shape to form a 3D network structure, which greatly increases the specific surface area of the hybrid material. The cycle performances of different MnO2/C–Zn batteries are determined to select the best sample (Fig. S3†). Due to the high specific capacity and the high MnO2 loading at the same time, 0.2 MnO2/C is chosen as the best sample and needs to be further characterized and tested.

The EIS of the 0.2 MnO2/C cathode and Zn plate at various states was studied in a three-electrode system. Fig. 3a and b present the Nyquist plots of the Zn plate with different states, and the corresponding parameters are shown in Table S3.† As shown in Fig. 3a and b, the Nyquist plots contain two semicircles: one is located in the high-frequency region, which is caused by the surface membrane, and the other is in the low-frequency region, which is related to the charge transfer resistance.45 The first intersection value of the curve and the abscissa axis represents the electrolyte resistance (Rs). At an open-circuit state, the Zn plate reflects a high interface impedance (Rsf = 250 Ω) and a high charge transfer impedance (Rct = 95.0 Ω). As the charge/discharge cycles proceed, both decrease significantly and become stable from the 6th cycle (Rsf = 0.433 Ω, Rct = 0.825 Ω). In addition, Fig. 3c gives the Nyquist plot of the polished Zn plate at an open-circuit state. Compared with Fig. 3a, the polished Zn plate shows lower Rsf (11.6 Ω) and Rct (3.03 Ω). Therefore, the high interface impedance of the Zn plate is caused by the ZnO film, which will be dissolved gradually with the charge and discharge processes. Simultaneously, the decline in the Rsf value greatly promotes the charge transfer. Fig. 2d shows the Nyquist plots of the 0.2 MnO2/C cathode in various states, and Table S4† lists the corresponding parameters. During cycling, the Rct value of the MnO2/C cathode is relatively low and decreases from 4.72 Ω to 0.598 Ω, which is beneficial to the reaction.

(c) The Nyquist plots of the polished Zn plate at the open-circuit state and the corresponding equivalent circuit models. (d) The Nyquist plots of the 0.2 MnO2/C cathode at various states and the corresponding equivalent circuit models. The above Nyquist plots were tested on the three-electrode system. The Zn plate and the saturated calomel electrode were used as the counter electrode and the reference electrode, respectively. A 2.0 M ZnSO4 + 0.5 M MnSO4 aqueous solution was used as the electrolyte. 
Moreover, the EIS of the 0.2 MnO2/C–Zn battery at different states is shown in Fig. S4.† At the open-circuit state, the 0.2 MnO2/C–Zn battery has only two semicircles, while at the other fully charged states, the battery possesses two semicircles and the Warburg impedance at the same time, which is different from the results of 0.2 MnO2/C cathode and Zn plate in the three-electrode system, and it is more like a superposition of both. Combining the above results with the three-electrode system, it is known that the Zn plate plays a major role in the EIS of the 0.2 MnO2/C–Zn battery at the open-circuit state (Fig. S4a†), so the Rsf value of the 0.2 MnO2/C–Zn battery is close to the one shown in Fig. 3a. At the other fully charge states, the Rsf and Warburg impedance are mainly contributed by the Zn plate and 0.2 MnO2/C cathode, respectively. The Rct value of the battery is determined by both the 0.2 MnO2/C cathode and the Zn plate. After the dissolution of the ZnO film and the activation of the 0.2 MnO2/C cathode, the 0.2 MnO2/C–Zn battery shows low Rsf (0.401 Ω, Table S2†) and Rct values (1.08 Ω, Table S2†).
The charge/discharge performance of the 0.2 MnO2/C–Zn battery at various current densities is shown in Fig. 4a. The discharge specific capacity of the battery at each current density is shown in Table S5.† The 0.2 MnO2/C–Zn battery could reach a high specific capacity of 203 mA h g−1 and 143 mA h g−1 at 3000 mA g−1 and 6000 mA g−1, respectively. It is suggested that the 0.2 MnO2/C–Zn battery possesses an excellent power performance. In addition, when the charge/discharge current density was changed from 6000 mA g−1 to 300 mA g−1 again, the discharge specific capacity of the 0.2 MnO2/C–Zn battery can be well recovered, indicating a good stability. The charge/discharge curves of the battery at different current densities corresponding to Fig. 4a are shown in Fig. S5a.† At a low current density, the discharge curve exhibits a turning point at about 1.3 V and the curve is divided into two stages (Fig. S5a†). With the increase in the charge/discharge current density, the capacity contribution in the voltage range of less than 1.3 V reduces gradually because the reaction rate of this stage is less than the one at 1.3–1.9 V. The Ragone plot (Fig. S5b†) of the 0.2 MnO2/C–Zn battery indicates that the 0.2 MnO2/C–Zn battery still generates a high energy density of 194 W h kg−1 at a high power density of 7922 W kg−1 due to the excellent power performance, which is better than the previous studies.21,46,47

(b) Cycle performance at a current density of 300 mA g−1 and (c) corresponding discharge–charge profile. (d) Cycling performance and the corresponding coulombic efficiency at a current density of 2000 mA g−1. 
The cycling stability of the 0.2 MnO2/C–Zn battery at 300 mA g−1 for 300 cycles is given in Fig. 4b. After 300 cycles, the 0.2 MnO2/C–Zn battery can maintain a high discharge specific capacity of 279.7 mA h g−1 and a high capacity retention rate of 92.22%, illustrating a good stability. Moreover, after the activation of the 0.2 MnO2/C–Zn battery, the coulombic efficiency of the battery became close to 100%, exhibiting a high reversibility. Fig. 4c gives the charge/discharge curves corresponding to Fig. 4b. The battery works with the mode of charging before discharging and the charge capacity of the first cycle is 38.0 mA h g−1 provided by the extraction of K+ from 0.2 MnO2/C. The proper extraction of K+ further improves the capacity of the battery under the premise of maintaining the original crystal structure of MnO2. The subsequent discharge curve has a significant discharge platform at about 1.2 V and a specific discharge capacity of 277.3 mA h g−1 can be attained. The charge/discharge curves of the 50th, 100th, 200th and 300th cycles are divided into three stages with 1.4 V and 1.3 V as a boundary and these curves are relatively concentrated, further illustrating the good stability of the 0.2 MnO2/C–Zn battery. Fig. S6† provides the XRD curves of the 0.2 MnO2/C cathode for the full charge state (1.9 V vs. Zn2+/Zn) at different cycles with 300 mA g−1. Among them, it is seen that the extraction of part of K+ during the charge in the first cycle does not cause the collapse of the crystal structure. Subsequently, MnO2 can still maintain a layered crystal structure in the charge state of the second and thirtieth cycle, reflecting a high structural stability of 0.2 MnO2/C. The long cycling performance of the calcined-MnO2–Zn battery at 300 mA g−1 is shown in Fig. S7a.† After 450 cycles, the specific capacity of the calcined-MnO2–Zn battery remains 36.5 mA h g−1 and the capacity retention rate is 28.34%, which suggests a poor stability. Fig. S7b† delivers the cycle performance of the 0.2 MnO2/C–Zn battery at 600 mA g−1. The gradual increase in specific capacity within the first 10 cycles belongs to the activation period. The specific capacity after 250 cycles at 600 mA g−1 is 266.4 mA h g−1 showing no significant decrease compared with that at/after 11th cycle (283.3 mA h g−1), and the coulombic efficiency is 99.62%. Moreover, at a high current density of 2000 mA g−1 (Fig. 4d), the 0.2 MnO2/C–Zn battery with an initial specific capacity of 257.7 mA h g−1 can maintain a high specific capacity of 159.4 mA h g−1 after 1500 cycles (the capacity retention rate, 61.85%). The performance at high current density is better than that reported previously.18,43,48,49 The reason for the excellent high rate performance is as follows: the 0.2 MnO2/C has a nanoflower-like structure with a large specific surface area so that the active material can be in a good contact with the electrolyte and Super P. Simultaneously, the layered crystal structure of MnO2 and the presence of crystal water in MnO2 allow the ions to diffuse more rapidly.39,40,50
In order to investigate the crystal structure evolution of 0.2 MnO2/C during cycling, ex situ XRD analysis was performed on the 0.2 MnO2/C cathode. Fig. 5a shows the overall evolution of 0.2 MnO2/C during cycling and the corresponding voltage–time curve, while the Fig. 5b–d show the XRD pattern at a specific position in Fig. 5a. The V1–V14 signs in Fig. 5a show that the electrodes stay at different voltage states. When the 0.2 MnO2/C–Zn battery is discharged from 1.9 V (V1) to 1.5 V (V2), the diffraction peaks of MnOOH appear at 26.1° (Fig. 5b, the magnified XRD peaks of MnOOH are shown in Fig. S8a†), proving that the H+ intercalation reaction produces MnOOH.51 The reaction (3) has taken place between V1 and V2. Subsequently, with the further discharge to 1.41 V (V3), the diffraction peak of Zn2Mn4O8·H2O arises gradually because of the Zn2+ insertion reaction. As the discharge continues (V3–V6), the Zn2+ insertion reaction (4) causes an increase in the interplanar distance belonging to the (211) plane of Zn2Mn4O8·H2O, which results in a shift of the diffraction peak at 36.3° to a smaller angle. Then, a diffraction peak of Zn4SO4(OH)6·5H2O appears in V6 and only the diffraction peaks of Zn4SO4(OH)6·5H2O can be found in V7–V10 (Fig. 5c, the XRD full patterns of Fig. 5c are shown in Fig. S8b†). The above phenomenon indicates that MnOOH and Zn2Mn4O8·H2O are initiated to transform into Zn4SO4(OH)6·5H2O at V6 and the degree of conversion will deepen as the discharge proceeds. Finally, the MnOOH and Zn2Mn4O8·H2O completely convert into Mn2+ and Zn4SO4(OH)6·5H2O. Moreover, the Mn4+/Mn2+ two-electron pathway can be achieved in the end. The discharge reaction process and schematic (Fig. 6) are as follows:

 Fig. 6  Schematic of the discharge reaction process. 
The cathode reaction: MnO2 + H+ + e− → MnOOH(3) 4MnO2 + 2Zn2+ + 4e− + H2O → Zn2Mn4O8·H2O(4) 2MnOOH + SO42− + 4Zn2+ + 7H2O + 2e− → Zn4SO4(OH)6·5H2O + 2Mn2+(5) 3Zn2Mn4O8·H2O + 8SO42− + 61H2O + 26Zn2+ + 12e− → 8Zn4SO4(OH)6·5H2O + 12Mn2+(6)
The anode reaction: Zn − 2e− → Zn2+(7)
In the subsequent charging stage, as shown in Fig. 5c and d, the phase evolutionary process is the reverse process of the discharge stage. Zn4SO4(OH)6·5H2O converted into MnOOH and Zn2Mn4O8·H2O firstly, and then the Zn2+ ion gradually got extracted from Zn2Mn4O8·H2O, followed by the H+ extraction from MnOOH. At the final charge state, the active material fully recovered to the original state of 0.2 MnO2/C.

Fig. 7 shows the SEM images of the cathode materials in the 0.2 MnO2/C–Zn battery at different cycling stages. As the 0.2 MnO2/C–Zn battery is discharged to 1.35 V (V4, Fig. 7a), the morphology of the material remains in nanoflower-like structure, so that the insertion of H+ and Zn2+ does not change the morphology of 0.2 MnO2/C. The SEM image of V6 in Fig. 7b shows that the nanoflower-like structure has disappeared and a new flaky structure appears, as indicated in the red square frame. Moreover, only flaky materials and fiberglass can be found on the electrode of V8 (Fig. 7c). Combined with the XRD results (Fig. 5b and c), the flaky material is speculated as the Zn4SO4(OH)6·5H2O and the conversion reactions (5) and (6) have taken place at V6. The reason for the presence of the fiberglass in the V8 electrode may be that the conversion reactions (5) and (6) consume a large amount of water, and the formation of Zn4SO4(OH)6·5H2O makes the surface of the electrode rough; therefore, the bonding force between the fiberglass and the electrode is too strong to fully peel it off. This result is consistent with that of the study by Mylad Chamoun.17 The subsequent charging phase, as indicated in the ex situ XRD results, is the inversion of the discharge process. When the 0.2 MnO2/C–Zn battery is charged to 1.485 V (V11, Fig. 7d), the reverse process of the conversion reactions (5) and (6) has occurred. As Zn4SO4(OH)6·5H2O gradually decreases, the bonding force between the glass fibers and the electrode is weakened, and then the glass fibers can be peeled off easily. Nevertheless, the nanoflower-structure is not found in the electrode V11 owing to the little amount of MnOOH and Zn2Mn4O8·H2O. Subsequently, the Zn4SO4(OH)6·5H2O with a flaky morphology disappears completely and a large amount of active material (MnOOH and Zn2Mn4O8·H2O) with a nanoflower structure is generated at the electrode V12 (Fig. 7e). At the final stage, the active material is completely restored to the original state.

The content of K+ and Mn2+ in the electrolyte was measured via ICP-MS (as shown in Table S6†). Table S6† shows that the electrolyte in the 0.2 MnO2/C–Zn battery contains K+ (32.9 mmol L−1) at 1.9 V of the 1st cycle on account of the K+ extraction from 0.2 MnO2/C during the first charge. The concentration of Mn2+ in the electrolyte at the charge state of the 1st cycle sustains 0.50 mol L−1, which is consistent with the Mn2+ concentration in the original electrolyte. Moreover, the K+ concentration in the electrolyte does not change significantly during the cycling of the 0.2 MnO2/C–Zn battery (32.52 mmol L−1 at 1.0 V of 1st cycle, 32.79 mmol L−1 at 1.9 V of 2nd cycle), so that the K+ does not get re-embed into MnO2 during discharge and does not participate in the following cycles. Simultaneously, the MnOOK contained in birnessite MnO2 is endowed with good stability, so the K+ in the MnO2 does not continue to get extracted in the following cycles, which is beneficial to the cycle performance of the 0.2 MnO2/C–Zn battery. However, the concentration of Mn2+ increases during the discharge of the battery (2.26 mol L−1 at 1.0 V of the 1st cycle) and decreases during the charge (1.39 mol L−1 at 1.9 V of the 2nd cycle) because of the existence of the conversion reactions (5) and (6). The Mn2+ concentration in the electrolyte does not completely return to the original electrolyte state (0.5 mol L−1), and it is the reason why the 0.2 MnO2/C–Zn battery fails to fully exert its theoretical capacity. In addition, known from the reactions (5) and (6), the reversibility of the 0.2 MnO2/C–Zn battery is greatly affected by the Mn2+ concentration in the electrolyte. The cycle performances of the 0.2 MnO2/C–Zn battery containing 2.0 M ZnSO4 and different MnSO4 concentrations are expressed in Fig. 8a. When the concentration of MnSO4 is at a low level (0.1 M), the 0.2 MnO2/C–Zn battery can remain stable in several cycles after activation, but the specific capacity decreases rapidly from the 15th cycle. When the concentration is changed to 0.2 M for MnSO4, the situation is similar to that with 0.1 M; however, the decreasing rate of the specific capacity is not as fast as the one with 0.1 M MnSO4. The phenomenon does not change until the MnSO4 concentration reaches 0.5 M. In this condition, the 0.2 MnO2/C–Zn battery can work stably. The conversions of MnOOH and Zn2Mn4O8·H2O are significantly affected by the concentration of Mn2+ in the electrolyte, thus requiring a higher concentration of MnSO4 to maintain the reversibility of the reactions (5) and (6). This situation is different from the study of Pan et al.,30 while it is similar to the study of Zhao et al.,52 which needs a higher concentration of MnSO4 to maintain the stability of the battery.

(c) The CV of the 0.2 MnO2/C–Zn battery at various scan rates ranging from 0.1 m V s−1 to 2.4 mV s−1 in the potential window of 1.0 V to 1.9 V vs. Zn2+/Zn. (d) Linearly fitted log(i)–log(ν) plots corresponding to Peak 1–Peak 4 of Fig. 8c. 
In order to explore the reasons for the deepening reaction (Mn4+/Mn3+ → Mn4+/Mn2+), the cycle performances of the 0.2 MnO2/C–Zn battery in 2.0 M ZnSO4 + 0.1 M MnSO4 with different pH values are tested (Fig. S9a†). When the pH of the electrolyte alters from 4.2 to 2.2, the cycle performance and the discharged specific capacity change slightly. Hence, it is not the main reason to deepen the reaction. In addition, as shown in Fig. S9b,† the 0.2 MnO2/C–Zn battery can provide a discharged specific capacity of more than 400 mA h g−1 at a low current density (60 mA g−1) and it is much higher than the theoretical capacity of the Mn4+/Mn3+ reaction with the one-electron pathway (308 mA h g−1). This result further confirms the conclusion of the ex situ XRD, and the 0.2 MnO2/C–Zn battery can possess larger capacity through the Mn4+/Mn2+ two-electron pathway reaction. Nevertheless, the discharged specific capacity of the calcined-MnO2–Zn battery (the calcined-MnO2 possesses higher crystallinity) at 60 mA g−1 is only about 200 mA h g−1, lower than the theoretical capacity of the Mn4+/Mn3+ reaction. Also, some previous studies have reported that there is only one electron Mn4+/Mn3+ reaction in the battery with calcined-MnO2.43,53 Therefore, the low crystallinity of 0.2 MnO2/C should be responsible for the deepening of the reaction.
The discharge specific capacity-cycle number curve of the 0.2 MnO2/C–Zn battery at 2000 mA g−1 for 40 cycles is given in Fig. S10,† and the XRD of the cathode at the 40th full discharge state (1.0 V) is shown in Fig. 5e. The diffraction peaks of Zn4SO4(OH)6·5H2O, MnOOH and Zn2Mn4O8·H2O are presented in Fig. 5e, which are similar to the result of V6 presented in Fig. 5b. Consequently, we can know the fact that the conversion reactions still exist in the 0.2 MnO2/C–Zn battery at 2000 mA g−1, and this can explain why the 0.2 MnO2/C–Zn battery has the ability to provide a high specific capacity (more than 200 mA h g−1) at 2000 mA g−1.
The electrochemical behavior of the 0.2 MnO2/C–Zn battery is further investigated by CV. In the second cycle of the CV curve located in Fig. 8b, there are significant reduction peaks at 1.33 V and 1.27 V, while a large overlap peak is situated at 1.57 V and the strength of the oxidation peak at 1.77 V is relatively low in the oxidation stage. After the first two cycles of activation, a new reduction Peak 5 is generated at 1.50 V and the potentials corresponding to the reduction peaks 3 and 1 also change (1.33 V → 1.35 V, 1.27 V → 1.25 V). Simultaneously, the current of the reduction Peak 3 becomes higher, while that of Peak 1 decreases to a lower level. In addition, the large peak at 1.57 V in the oxidation stage is differentiated into Peak 2 (1.55 V) and Peak 4 (1.63 V), and the current of Peak 6 at 1.77 V gradually increases, indicating that the reaction corresponding to Peak 5 and Peak 6 makes more contribution gradually in subsequent cycles. Fig. S11† shows the CV curve of the 0.2 MnO2/C–Zn battery using 2.0 M ZnSO4 + 0.1 M MnSO4 as the electrolyte. Compared with Fig. 8b, the CV curve is lack of the obvious peaks 5 and 6 at 1.50 V and 1.77 V respectively, but the two small peaks emerge at 1.42 V and 1.70 V. Since the content of MnSO4 in 2.0 M ZnSO4 + 0.1 M MnSO4 is lower than that in 2.0 M ZnSO4 + 0.5 M MnSO4, and the pH of the former (pH = 4.2) is higher than that of the latter (pH = 3.5). As a result, the electrolyte with a lower content of MnSO4 is not conducive to the insertion of H+; however, it facilitates the extraction of H+, which eventually leads to the movement of the potential for the insertion/extraction of H+. Moreover, it can reconfirm that the peaks 5 and 6 belong to the insertion/extraction of H+ [reaction (3)]. Combined with the results of the ex situ XRD, peaks 3 and 4 pertain to the insertion/extraction of Zn2+ [reaction (4)], while Peak 1 is related to the conversion reactions (5) and (6) and Peak 2 is related to the inverse process.
The CV at different scan rates was further used to determine the charge storage behavior of the 0.2 MnO2/C–Zn battery. In Fig. 8c, as the scan rate increases, the current of Peak 1–Peak 6 increases gradually and the voltage of Peak 1 and 3 moves to the low voltage direction and those of Peak 2 and 4 have an offset to the high voltage direction, which is caused by ionic diffusion limitation. In the CV curve, the current at different scan rates has a power function relationship with a scan rate based on i = avb,54,55 where a and b are variable parameters and b is obtained from the slope of the log(i)–log(ν) curve. From Fig. 8d, it can be seen that the parameter b of the Peak 1–4 is close to 0.5, confirming that the insertion/extraction of Zn2+ and the conversion reaction are controlled by diffusion. The conversion reaction is more affected by ionic diffusion owing to the smaller b value. In addition, with the increase in the scan rate, the ratio of IPeak 2/IPeak 1 and IPeak 3/IPeak 4 gradually decreases from >1 to <1 in Table S7,† which reconfirms that the conversion reactions bear more impact by ion diffusion.
The ionic diffusion coefficient (Dion) in the bulk phase is an important parameter for determining the dynamic performance of Zn-ion batteries. The ionic diffusion coefficient can be calculated using the following formula:56,57 (8)where R represents the gas constant, T represents the working temperature of the battery (298.15 K), n means the number of the electrons transferred per molecule, F means the Faraday constant, A is the electrode area (1.13 cm2), and Cion reflects the concentration of ions in the active material. The Warburg factor (σ) is the slope of line Z′–ω−1/2 and can be obtained from the fitting results in Fig. 9. As mentioned above, the reactions at 1.63 V and 1.77 V are related to the extraction of Zn2+ from Zn2Mn4O8·H2O and the extraction of H+ from MnOOH. The values of the parameters in formula (8) are shown in Table S8.†
 Fig. 9  Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of 0.2 MnO2/C at 1.63 V and 1.77 V (a) and the corresponding plots of Z′–ω−1/2 in the Warburg region (b). 
The ionic diffusion coefficients of Zn2+ and H+ were measured (DZn2+ = 1.55 × 10−13 cm2 s−1, DH+ = 9.49 × 10−12 cm2 s−1), which are higher than those obtained in the study by the predecessors.16,18,58 The existence of crystalline water in MnO2 playing a part of the charge shielding role promotes the rapid diffusion of the ions in the bulk phase.40,50 The layered crystal structure of birnessite MnO2 has a small barrier to the ionic diffusion and large enough interlayer spacing to allow zinc ions to be intercalated and extracted through the hydrated state, which can promote the ion diffusion through the charge shielding effect of hydrated water.59 Simultaneously, the MnO2 nanosheets shorten the ion diffusion distance. Therefore, the layered crystal structure of birnessite MnO2, the existence of crystalline water between the layers of MnO6 and the large specific surface area of the nanoflower structure should be responsible for the high ion diffusion coefficient. It is the foundation for the high power performance of the 0.2 MnO2/C–Zn battery, as shown in Fig. S5b.†
Conclusion
In summary, a new cathode MnO2/C composite for a high-performance Zn–MnO2 battery was developed. The nanoflower-like structure reduced the agglomeration of MnO2 and the low crystallinity promoted the conversion of MnOOH and Zn2Mn4O8·H2O to Mn2+ and Zn4SO4(OH)6·5H2O. Therefore, MnO2 can carry out a deeper reaction via the Mn4+/Mn2+ two-electron reaction pathway. Because of the layered crystal structure of MnO2, the existence of crystalline water and the large specific surface area of the MnO2/C composite facilitating the insertion/extraction of Zn2+ and the Zn2+ diffusion, the 0.2 MnO2/C–Zn battery exhibited an initial capacity of more than 200 mA h g−1 at 2000 mA g−1. In addition, the 0.2 MnO2/C–Zn battery showed a high specific capacity of 279.7 mA h g−1 after 300 cycles at 300 mA g−1. Due to the advantages of high capacity, high rate performance and good stability, the as-synthesized MnO2/C nanostructure is a promising cathode material for the aqueous Zn-ion batteries. The insight understanding of the birnessite MnO2 may shed light on exploring the next-generation electrode materials for energy storage.
