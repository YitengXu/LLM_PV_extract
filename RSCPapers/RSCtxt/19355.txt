    , Accepted 7th April 2020First published on 13th April 2020AbstractThe electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) to produce valuable fuels and chemicals with renewable energy inputs is an attractive route to convert intermittent green energy sources (e.g., solar and wind) to chemical energy, alleviate our dependence on fossil fuels, and simultaneously reduce net carbon dioxide emission. However, the generation of reduced multi-carbon products with high energy density and wide applicability from the CO2RR, such as oxygenates and hydrocarbons, suffers from high overpotential, slow reaction rate, and low selectivity due to its intrinsic multi-electron transfer nature. Moreover, the involved anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) also requires large overpotential and its product O2 bears limited economic value. The potentially generated reactive oxygen species (ROS) during the OER may also degrade the membrane of a CO2 reduction electrolyzer. Herein, we review the recent progress in novel integrated strategies to address the aforementioned challenges in the electrocatalytic CO2RR. These innovative strategies include (1) concurrent CO2 electroreduction via co-feeding additional chemicals besides CO2 gas, (2) tandem CO2 electroreduction utilizing other catalysts for converting the in situ formed products from the CO2RR into more valuable chemicals, and (3) hybrid CO2 electroreduction through integrating thermodynamically more favourable organic upgrading reactions to replace the anodic OER. We specifically highlight these novel integrated electrolyzer designs instead of focusing on nanostructured engineering of various electrocatalysts, in the hope of inspiring others to approach CO2 electroreduction from a holistic perspective. The current challenges and future opportunities of electrocatalytic CO2 reduction will also be discussed at the end.
1. Introduction
The development of the human society and the increasing worldwide population require massive energy, which is presently derived from non-renewable fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas since the Industrial Revolution.1–3 However, excessive CO2 emission from the utilization of fossil energy poses severely detrimental effects on the environment, climate and health of our planet, such as the greenhouse effect.4–8 It necessitates intense research on sustainable CO2 capture and conversion technologies.6,7 In response, the renewable energy-driven room-temperature electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) represents a viable alternative to utilize intermittent green energy sources (e.g., sun and wind) for the conversion of otherwise waste CO2 to chemical energy in the form of fuels and feedstocks like CO, methanol, ethylene, propanol and others (Fig. 1), which not only reduces our dependence on legacy fossil fuels but also mitigates the climatic deterioration.8

However, due to the extremely strong chemical bond in CO2 (CO, 806 kJ mol−1),9 the electrochemical CO2RR usually needs large overpotentials to promote the sluggish kinetics, even highly active electrocatalysts are employed, which lower the energy conversion efficiencies.4–9 Moreover, the most oxidized form of carbon in CO2 renders the CO2RR a multi-electron transfer nature and various products can be obtained through different pathways (Fig. 2), resulting in the low selectivity of the CO2RR for a specific product.4–9 Although many nanostructured materials such as single-atom catalysts,9,10 noble-metal nanocrystals11 and metal complexes12 have been reported to reduce CO2 to CO with extremely high efficiency, the generation of more reduced multi-carbon products with higher energy density and wider applicability such as oxygenates and hydrocarbons is still limited by the low selectivity, slow production rate and few catalyst candidates, plus low energy conversion efficiency.8 For example, Cu is generally considered to be the only metal that can form deeply reduced products with acceptable yields.4b,5a,8 Currently, the well-designed reaction interface of a Cu catalyst reported by Sargent's group can reduce CO2 to ethylene with a faradaic efficiency of 70% in an alkaline electrolyte (KOH) at an overpotential of 550 mV.13 Another well-known limitation is the four-electron process of the involved oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode during the CO2RR, which also requires high overpotentials to complete the overall process and thus lowers the efficiency of the CO2RR.1b,3c,14 Furthermore, the OER product O2 is not highly valuable and its side-products, reactive oxygen species (ROS), may degrade the electrolyzer membrane, resulting in premature failure of an electrolyzer.1b Overall, the practical cell voltage of the CO2RR is always substantially larger than its thermodynamic potential.

To tackle the aforementioned challenges, most efforts have focused on engineering the electrocatalysts with varying facets, compositions, and defects, tailoring the reaction interface, and designing the membrane electrode assembly, as shown in recent excellent review papers.5b,15–20 However, the recently developed integrated strategies for the system engineering of a CO2RR electrolyzer have rarely been summarized, in spite of their promising role in practical CO2 electroreduction. In this minireview, we present the recent progress in novel integrated strategies (Fig. 3) termed (1) concurrent CO2 electroreduction via simultaneously feeding additional chemicals with CO2 gas, (2) tandem CO2 electroreduction utilizing other catalysts to convert the in situ formed products from the CO2RR into more valuable chemicals, and (3) hybrid CO2 electroreduction through integrating thermodynamically more favourable organic oxidation reactions to replace the anodic OER. For each type of integration, we summarize the major achievements and discuss the predominant trends for improving their performance. Finally, we provide our own perspective on the development of future integrated CO2RR.

2. Integrated design for CO2 electroreduction
2.1 Concurrent CO2 electroreduction
Since CO2 or CO only contains one carbon atom, coupling of two adsorbed CO intermediates during the CO2RR and CORR is highly desirable and has been proposed as the rate limiting step for the generation of multi-carbon oxygenates and hydrocarbons.4–8 Changing the coverage of adsorbed CO intermediates can dramatically vary the reaction pathways and hence the final products in terms of selectivities and yields.4 In addition, the industrial waste streams are usually CO2/CO mixtures.21 It's thus technically and scientifically important to explore the electrocatalytic concurrent reduction of mixed CO2/CO feeds (Fig. 3a). Accordingly, Strasser's group systematically studied the hydrocarbon generation rates on copper oxide nanoparticle (CuOx NP) electrocatalysts under various CO2/CO co-feeding conditions.21 They found the significantly beneficial effect of mixed CO2/CO co-feeds on the ethylene (C2H4) yield. The spherical CuOx NPs were used as model electrocatalysts. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) investigation revealed the monodispersity of CuOx NPs with an average diameter of 9.4 ± 1.1 nm (Fig. 4a). Deconvolution of the Rietveld refined high-energy X-ray diffraction (HE-XRD) pattern of CuOx NPs disclosed the co-presence of face-centred cubic Cu (18.0 ± 2.9 wt%), cubic Cu2O (33.4 ± 5.3 wt%), and monoclinic CuO (39.2 ± 6.2 wt%). The electrocatalytic behaviours of these CuOx NPs in pure CO2, pure CO, and CO2/CO mixtures (COx) were evaluated in neutral buffers with a two-compartment configuration. Potentiostatic electrolysis at −1.0 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) for several hours was used to assess the electrochemical COx reduction rates and the relevant selectivity. Fig. 4b and c showed the time-dependent absolute production rates of ethylene (C2H4) and methane (CH4). It can be seen that the production rate of C2H4 is significantly promoted in the feeds of CO2/CO mixtures over the entire range of feed ratios (Fig. 4b and d) compared to those in pure CO2 and pure CO feeds. In contrast, the formation rate of CH4 is strongly dependent on the feed compositions and follow the order CO > CO2/CO > CO2 (Fig. 4c). Considering the direct dependence of CH4 formation on the redox state of a reactant, it's reasonable that the six-electron CO-to-CH4 cascade reaction proceeds faster than the eight-electron pathway (CO2-to-CH4). Interestingly, by increasing the CO ratio in the co-feeds, the total production rate of both CH4 and C2H4 (simply called the hydrocarbon production rate) sharply increased by about 50% (Fig. 4d right), despite a lower concentration of total COx in electrolyte. Given the fact that pure CO favours proton accessibility to adsorbed intermediates, it was concluded that a hydrogenated dimer (*CO–COH) generated in a consecutive electron–proton McMurry coupling-type transfer accounted for the C2H4 formation,22 different from the reaction mechanism of the CH4 generation. The non-monotonic relationship between the C2H4 production rate and CO2 partial pressure (Fig. 4e) hindered an optimum CO2-to-CO ratio featuring the maximum C2H4 yields.

(f) Comparison of DEMS ion current sweeps over time for ethylene-related molecular fragments (M–H+), fragments in the 12CO2/12CO (1:3) co-feed (light purple curve) and the corresponding 12CO2/Ar (1:3) feed (light-orange curve). A CO2 partial pressure of 25 kPa and an Ar/CO partial pressure of 75 kPa were maintained in both cases. The bottom plot shows the concurrent cyclic voltammetric sweep over time.

To understand the enhanced mechanism of C2H4 production in co-feeds, an operando differential electrochemical mass spectrometer (DEMS) equipped with a newly designed capillary cell with millisecond time resolution was developed and employed to track and quantify the origins of two individual carbon atoms in the produced C2H4via13CO isotope-labelling. The ion mass currents of hydrogen-abstracted molecular fragments (M–H+) represented real-time C2H4 products under cathodic and anodic scan directions (Fig. 4f). In the cathodic scanning region, the ion mass current for C2H4 production with the 12CO2/12CO co-feed (purple curve in Fig. 4f) almost overlapped with that with the 12CO2 feed (orange curve in Fig. 4f), implying that the dimerization of CO2-derived surface-adsorbed *CO accounts for the C2H4 formation and this self-feeding of CO from CO2 reduction was seemingly sufficient. Meanwhile in the anodic scanning region, only the 12CO2/12CO co-feed guaranteed the comparable generation of C2H4, suggesting the presence of CO depletion at the electrocatalytic interface. The isotope-labelled 12CO2/13CO co-feed and 12CO2/Ar and 13CO/Ar feeds with comparable partial pressures were then investigated to deconvolute the origin of the carbon atoms in C2H4 and to assess the respective contributions of the three competing pathways for C2H4 formation (red, blue and green curves in Fig. 4f). The red curve corresponded to the 13C2H3+ fragment of the 13CO–13CO pathway with a current of Im/z=29, where CO stemmed entirely from the 13CO feed; the green curve corresponded to the 12C2H3+ fragment of the 12CO–12CO pathway with a current of Im/z=27, where CO stemmed entirely from the non-labelled CO2 feed; and the blue curve corresponded to the 13C12CH3+ fragment (Im/z=28) related to the 12CO2–13CO coupling pathway, where ethylene was formed from CO originating from CO2 and from 13CO in the feed. The respective three CO dimerization pathways to C2H4 are schematically illustrated using their corresponding colours (M1–M3). This DEMS analysis also demonstrated that the onset potential (E) for C2H4 production positively shifted by about 120 mV in the pure CO feed (ECO = −0.72 VRHE) compared to that in the pure CO2 feed (ECO2 = −0.84 VRHE), suggesting the faster kinetics of the electrocatalytic CO reduction to C2H4. Deep analysis and integration of the three curves uncovered that 67% of C2H4 could be attributed to CO in the feed during the COxRR. On the basis of the above results, the authors sketched the reaction mechanisms under the three feed conditions, as shown in Fig. 4g. Two types of two-site hypotheses including Langmuir–Hinshelwood and Eley–Rideal (ER)-type reaction pathways were proposed. To mimic the co-feed conditions, the authors prepared a bifunctional tandem catalyst containing NiNC of high surface area as a CO producer and a support and CuOx NPs as dimerization sites for C2H4 production (Fig. 4h). As shown in Fig. 4i, the electrocatalytic performance of the CuOx–NiNC tandem catalyst for C2H4 generation from the CO2RR was largely enhanced compared to pure CuOx NPs at two applied potentials. Moreover, the CuOx–NiNC tandem catalyst produced less free CO gas at an overpotential of −0.84 VRHE relative to pure NiNC, suggesting that some of the generated CO on NiNC was immediately consumed by CuOx in the tandem catalyst.
Koper's group reported the co-reduction of CO2 with the addition of methanol to produce dimethyl carbonate.23 By using in situ Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, the authors showed the formation of an intermediate containing CO and C–O groups from the reaction between methoxy groups from methanol with generated CO from the CO2RR on diverse catalysts such as Cu, Pt and Pb. More recently, Xu's group fed acetaldehyde during the CORR on oxide-derived copper (OD-Cu) and found that 36% of 1-propanol can be produced from the coupling of an adsorbed methylcarbonyl intermediate from acetaldehyde and CO.24
Besides promising C–C coupling to multi-carbon feedstocks, Jiao's group recently demonstrated that C–N bonds could be formed through NH3 feeding during a CO2-derived CORR on highly crystalline Cu NPs with a small fraction of Cu oxides.25 The overall strategy is schematically outlined in Fig. 5a. Under steady-state galvanostatic electrolysis in 1 M KOH, a total current density of 500 mA cm−2 was observed for approximately 80% C2+ products including ethylene, ethanol, acetate, and n-propanol (Fig. 5b left). After feeding NH3 gas with CO in a molar ratio of 2:1 (NH3:CO), the applied potential increased by ∼30 mV to afford the same current density probably due to the reduced CO partial pressure. However, the addition of NH3 considerably increased the acetamide yield with a faradaic efficiency of up to 38% and a current density of 114 mA cm−2 at −0.68 V vs. RHE (Fig. 5b right). Meanwhile, the faradaic efficiencies for the formation of both ethylene and alcohols decreased at moderate to high overpotentials, whereas that for acetate was almost unchanged. Instead of NH3, ammonium hydroxide led to similar results, suggesting that acetamide could be produced in both gas and liquid NH3. Increasing the KOH concentration shifted the selectivity from amide to acetate during the CORR, implying that a ketene intermediate was probably formed and nucleophilically attacked by either OH− or NH3 to form acetate or acetamide, respectively (Fig. 5c). Because the ketene intermediate contained only one oxygen from CO, another oxygen in the resulting acetate should originate from water. A 18CO isotopic labelling study verified that the oxygen in acetamide came from CO, further evidencing the proposed ketene-mediated reaction mechanism (Fig. 5c). Full-solvent quantum mechanical calculations showed that two CO molecules dimerized followed by sequential H transfer from two surface water molecules to form the *(HO)CCOH intermediate, which then went through two different pathways. One formed *CCOH which accounts for ethylene (65%) and ethanol/n-propanol (35%). The other led to the formation of *CCO through a water-mediated pathway, which is attacked by either OH− or NH3 to form acetate or acetamide, respectively (Fig. 5c). With these insights, Jiao et al. extended the reaction substrate to methylamine, ethylamine and dimethylamine, and results analogous to the CO/NH3 co-feeding were obtained where substantial amounts of N-methylacetamide, N-ethylacetamide and N,N-dimethylacetamide were produced at total current densities of up to 300 mA cm−2 with maximum faradaic efficiencies of 42%, 34%, and 36%, respectively. The ability to generate heteroatom-containing carbon species would increase the potential of CO2 or CO electrolysis technologies for practical applications.

2.2 Tandem CO2 electroreduction
Despite the substantial progress that has been made to improve the activity and selectivity to C1, C2 and even C3 products with appreciable efficiencies, the direct and highly selective CO2RR to C3+ products still remains a major challenge.26–28 A promising strategy to address this concern is to directly transform the products from the CO2RR via biological catalysts (i.e., bacterium), as so-called “tandem CO2 electroreduction” (Fig. 3b).
For example, Schmid's group described the highly efficient production of butanol and hexanol from CO2 and H2O with renewable energy, which was achieved by solar-powered CO2RR in tandem with a bioprocess module (fermentation) for anaerobic conversion of the products of the CO2RR (Fig. 6a).26 For the CO2 electrolyzer, an Ag-based gas diffusion electrode served as the cathode to afford high current density and IrOx as the anode. Not all the CO2 feed was converted to CO and H2 was co-formed due to proton reduction. The total faradaic efficiencies of CO and H2 were around 100% (Fig. 6b), suggesting the absence of other gases like O2. For instance, at a current density of 300 mA cm−2 and a CO2 flow rate of 90 sccm (standard cubic centimetre per min), the faradaic efficiencies of CO and H2 were nearly 70% and 30%, respectively (Fig. 6b), and both remained almost constant for more than 1200 h (Fig. 6c). The absence of O2 in the outlet syngas (CO and H2, and CO2) was vital for the following bioprocess module, because high O2 concentration is toxic for the bacteria in the fermentation phase.

(b) Dependence of faradaic efficiencies (FEs) and energy conversion efficiencies (EEs) on the current densities. The anolyte and catholyte solutions, 0.1 M K2SO4/1.5 M KHCO3 (pH ≈ 7), were continuously cycled and mixed at a flow rate of 200 ml min−1. The temperature was 30 °C and the CO2 flow rate was 90 sccm. (c) Stability of CO-FE and H2-FE at an electric current density of 300 mA cm−2. The cell voltage remained constant within 7.0–7.5 V during the course of the experiment. The cathode and anode were 9.5 mm apart and separated by a high-conductivity, zirconium-oxide-based diaphragm. The anolyte and catholyte solutions, 0.4 M K2SO4/0.5 M KHCO3 (pH ≈ 7), were continuously cycled and mixed at a flow rate of 200 ml min−1. The temperature was 30 °C and the CO2 flow rate was 100 sccm. (d) Reactions and (e) data for acetate and ethanol formation by C. autoethanogenum from H2, CO, and CO2 produced using the CO2 electrolyzer that was powered by electricity from a PV module. (f) Reactions and (g) data for the formation of acetate (C2OOH), ethanol (C2OH), butyrate (C4OOH), butanol (C4OH), hexanoate (C6OOH), and hexanol (C6OH) from H2, CO, and CO2 by C. autoethanogenum plus C. kluyveri. Reproduced from ref. 26 with permission from Springer Nature, Copyright 2018. 
Given the excellent performance of the well-developed CO2 electrolyzer, the authors firstly coupled it with a commercially available photovoltaic (PV) device and syngas was produced at a rate of 16.52 sccm with a composition of 11.76% CO (4.8 mmol h−1), 6.37% H2 (2.6 mmol h−1) and 81.86% CO2 (33.4 mmol h−1). For the conversion to high-value acetate and ethanol (Fig. 6d), the resulting mixture was then fed with 1 L fermenters with C. autoethanogenum acetogen and 0.5 L culture at 36 °C.26,29 Stationary conditions were reached after 50 h, where the cell concentration, the consumption rates of CO and H2, and the production rates of acetate and ethanol were constant for the next 45 h. The consumption of CO and H2 syngas (3.35 mmol h−1) agreed well with the reduction of CO2 to acetate and ethanol, suggesting a faradaic efficiency of almost 100% (Fig. 6e). Based on the ethanol production, the calculated efficiency of energy conversion (EE) in this fermentation was about 80%. Considering the 50% EE for the CO2 reduction electrolyzer at 50 mA cm−2 and 20% EE for the PV module, the overall EE was as high as 8%.
Further inoculating the above fermenters with C. kluyveri led to the conversion of acetate and ethanol to butyrate and hexanoate and then to butanol and hexanol (Fig. 6f). The authors then initiated the CO2 electrolyzer at 150 mA cm−2 to constantly generate syngas with a flow rate of 16.23 sccm and a composition of 10% CO (4 mmol h−1), 60% H2 (24.2 mmol h−1) and 30% CO2 (12.2 mmol h−1). Again the syngas was fed into 1 L fermenters with 0.5 L C. autoethanogenum culture for 22 h followed by additional inoculation with C. kluyveri. At the moment of addition, acetate and ethanol were already formed from CO, H2 and CO2 by C. autoethanogenum (Fig. 6d). The additional inoculation gave rise to the formation of butanol and hexanol by C. autoethanogenum and C. kluyveri (Fig. 6f). After approaching stationary state conditions, the rates of CO and H2 consumption and those of acetate and ethanol formation remained constant for 45 h. The consumed amounts of CO and H2 (14.88 mmol h−1 in total) again agreed well with the molar electron pairs (14.52 mmol h−1) required to reduce CO2 to the three acids and alcohols (Fig. 6g), indicating the high faradaic efficiency close to 100%. The EE for butanol and hexanol formation was calculated to be about 78% at a rate of 0.6 × 10−3 moles per hour per litre of culture. In addition to C. kluyveri, other microorganisms like Pelobacter propionicus can be combined with C. autoethanogenum to ferment ethanol and CO2 to propionate and acetate or oleaginous yeast, and to convert ethanol and acetate to lipids. The superior flexibility of this tandem design leads to the production of various platform chemicals bearing high faradaic efficiencies.
Recently, Ager's group reported a two-step sequential electrocatalytic process to convert CO2 into C2+ hydrocarbons and oxygenates by situating the Ag electrode upstream of the Cu electrode in a continuous flow reactor, at which CO was formed from CO2 reduction on Ag, and further converted into C–C coupled products on Cu. By combining convection–diffusion simulations and electrochemical experiments, the optimal device led to a relative increase in the formation rate of C2 and C3 oxygenates as compared to ethylene.30
2.3 Hybrid CO2 electroreduction
For a conventional CO2 electrolyzer, the OER takes place to complete the electrocatalysis cycle, which requires large overpotential to produce appreciable current density.31–36 Thermodynamic analysis indicates that the OER leads to an energy loss of about 90% during CO2 reduction to CO.33 Also, its product O2 is not highly valuable and the side products of the OER, reactive oxygen species, may degrade the electrolyzer membrane and hence shorten the durability of electrolyzers. Similar to hybrid water electrocatalysis,1b,3c replacing the OER with thermodynamically more favourable organic oxidative upgrading reactions would not only lower the voltage input and exclude the formation of ROS, but also produce more valuable organic products on the anode,37–41 maximizing the energy return of CO2 electroreduction (Fig. 3c).
Berlinguette's group reported the cathodic reduction of CO2 to CO integrated with the anodic oxidation of four classes of representative alcohols to the corresponding carbonyl compounds (Fig. 7a) in a single two-compartment electrochemical cell.32 Each compartment contained 25 mL of 0.5 M NaHCO3 aqueous solution and was separated by a Nafion proton exchange membrane. A Cu–In alloy film on titanium served as the cathode and a platinum mesh was used as the anode. The polarization curve of the CO2RR at the Cu–In cathode showed an onset potential of about −0.36 V vs. RHE and a current density of 3.7 mA cm−2 at −0.70 V vs. RHE (Fig. 7b) with a faradaic efficiency of 80% for the formation of CO. This high performance enabled a reliable platform for the study of hybrid electrolysis. Electrochemical oxidation of four alcohols was then investigated in the same electrolyte. As shown in Fig. 7c, 1-phenylethanol (1-PEA) was used as a substrate (the other three alcohols exhibited similar behaviour). Because Pt cannot directly oxidize 1-PEA, TEMPO was employed as a redox mediator. The cyclic voltammogram of TEMPO exhibited a reversible redox couple at 1.3 V vs. RHE. After adding 1-PEA, the current density increased slightly, indicative of charge transfer between TEMPO and 1-PEA and the more favourable alcohol oxidation than the OER in the potential window of 1.2–1.8 V vs. RHE. A two-electrode hybrid CO2 electroreduction process was then conducted at a constant potential of −0.70 V for 3 h at which a stable current density of about 3.7 mA cm−2 was maintained (Fig. 7d). Quantitative analysis confirmed that the faradaic efficiencies were above 70% over the entire 3 h, while the faradaic efficiency for the oxidation of 1-PEA to acetophenone (ACP) was ca. 95% for the first 30 min and then decreased to approximately 70% at 1.5 h. The OER became dominant for the last 1.5 h due to the gradual consumption of 1-PEA (Fig. 7e), and thus the average faradaic efficiency for ACP formation was calculated to be merely 36% over the entire experiment. The other three alcohols were all oxidized with yields of 78–93% after 3 h electrolysis. These results collectively indicated that the formation of CO and ACP is favoured over the competing HER and OER until depletion of alcohol substrates, respectively, suggesting the success of the proposed hybrid CO2 electroreduction.

More recently, Kenis's group replaced the OER with the oxidation of high-volume building block chemicals such as glycerol, a cheap by-product of industrial biodiesel and soap production and biomass-derived glucose.33 From a combined theoretical and experimental approach, it was revealed that this process lowered the cell potential for CO2 electroreduction by approximately 0.85 V, resulting in a reduction in the electricity consumption by up to 53%. From the thermodynamic point of view, the standard Gibbs free energies of the CO2 reduction to CO and the OER are 20.1 and 237.1 kJ mol−1, respectively, indicative of 92.2% of the overall energy consumption for driving the OER. Fig. 8 showed the calculated standard cell voltage (|E0cell|) for the combination of CO2-to-CO reduction and the oxidation of glycerol or glucose. The results hinted that a noteworthy lowering of |E0cell| and hence electricity requirements can be saved. To assess the practicality of the above proposed processes, they performed electrochemical evaluation of different hybrids using a gas diffusion layer (GDL) electrode-based flow electrolyzer. The catholyte was 2.0 M KOH, while the anolyte was a mixture of 2.0 M KOH and 2.0 M glycerol or a mixture of 2.0 M KOH and 2.0 M glucose for the electro-oxidation of glycerol and glucose, respectively. Fig. 8b demonstrated that coupling the electro-oxidation of glycerol or glucose rather than the OER on a Pt black-coated GDL anode reduced the onset cell potential for the reduction of CO2 to CO on an Ag-coated GDL cathode from −1.6 V to −0.75 and −0.95 V, respectively. Also, the partial current density of CO (jCO) for the glycerol electro-oxidation was much higher than that for the glucose electro-oxidation, suggestive of the more promising effect of the former. Based on jCO, electro-oxidation of glycerol instead of the OER resulted in a 37–53% reduction of electricity requirements and thus improved the process economics. A single-electrode plot suggested that the major improvement was ascribed to the anode while the cathodic CO2 electroreduction was not affected (Fig. 8c). Product quantification confirmed the formation of value-added chemicals such as HCOO− and lactate from the glycerol electro-oxidation, which further improved the economics of the overall hybrid process. A similar decrease of onset cell potentials for the electroreduction of CO2 to HCOO−, C2H4, and C2H5OH was also observed when using the glycerol electro-oxidation instead of the OER (Fig. 8d). For example, the onset cell potentials for the electroreduction of CO2 to HCOO− on a Sn-coated GDL cathode, and to C2H4 and C2H5OH on a Cu-coated GDL cathode decreased from −1.75, −1.8, and −2.1 V to −0.9, −0.95, and −1.3 V, respectively. Finally, durability tests indicated that the cell potential and faradaic efficiency for CO generation were stable over 1.5 h.

Apart from alcohol oxidation, dye oxidation removal is another alternative to replace the OER. Purkait's group used crystal violet oxidation on a non-precious metal Co3O4 anode to replace the OER.42
3. Conclusions
In this minireview, we have summarized the recent integrated strategies to address concerns in the electrocatalytic CO2RR to multi-carbon products with higher energy density and wider applicability, including high overpotentials, low selectivity and slow reactivity. These innovative strategies include (1) concurrent CO2 electroreduction via deliberately feeding additional gas or liquid chemicals besides CO2 gas to favour the formation of high-value products, (2) tandem CO2 electroreduction utilizing other catalysts to convert the in situ formed products from the CO2RR into more valuable chemicals, and (3) hybrid CO2 electroreduction through integrating thermodynamically more favourable organic upgrading reactions to replace the anodic OER for lower energy inputs. These strategies are different from the conventional focus of electrocatalyst design for high performance. Even though such new directions are still in an early stage, some pioneering studies demonstrate their promising role in the practical CO2 electroreduction. Despite the tremendous progress that has been made, there still exist many challenges and opportunities in these fields.
In terms of concurrent CO2 electroreduction, more substrates need to be explored for co-reduction with CO2 or CO. For instance, Sargent's group recently reported that nitrate (NO3−) can be electrochemically reduced using Cu and a CuNi alloy to NH3 in 1.0 M KOH.43 The relevant experimental parameters such as the Cu electrocatalysts and the pH of the electrolyte (1.0 M KOH) are the same as those for the CO2RR or CORR, such that it's very promising to investigate the co-reduction of CO2 or CO with NO3−. In addition, the underlying origin of improved selectivity under co-feed conditions is still not fully understood, and in situ spectroscopic studies combined with theoretical investigations should be systematically employed to provide deep insights.
For tandem CO2 electroreduction, it's vital to optimize the process design due to the continuous conditions in an industrial process, which is different from that in laboratories. Matching the system components is a prerequisite for continuous operation to avoid the possible accumulation of intermediates.
Besides exploring more abundant organics such as biomass and biowaste for hybrid CO2 electroreduction, a key fact is that although many organic oxidation processes are much easier than oxygen evolution, the required overpotentials are still quite high given the relatively low thermodynamic potentials of these organic oxidation reactions. In some cases, the issue of electrocatalyst poisoning by organics could be severe. It's thus challenging to explore highly efficient, robust and low-cost anodic electrocatalysts for this hybrid electrocatalysis strategy. Structure engineering is effective in tuning the local solid–liquid interfaces of electrocatalysts and thus modulates their electrochemical performance, such as shaping, doping and strain creating.44
In addition to the development of the introduced strategies, much higher integration and diverse coupling are desirable as well to further improve the economics of the CO2RR. For example, although both concurrent CO2 electroreduction and tandem CO2 electroreduction strategies can enhance the generation of multi-carbon products, the OER is still involved in their anodes. Incorporation of tandem and hybrid CO2 electroreduction is expected to further improve the overall energy conversion efficiency and return of the integrated devices. Finally, careful technoeconomic analysis should be conducted before commercialization.
