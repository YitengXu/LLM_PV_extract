    , Accepted 4th November 2022First published on 4th November 2022AbstractWe conducted a comprehensive density functional theory investigation using the r2SCAN-rVV10 functional on the structural stability and electrochemical properties of boridenes for their use as anode materials in rechargeable alkaline (earth) metal-ion batteries (Li+, Na+, K+, Mg2+ and Ca2+). According to first-principles molecular dynamics simulations and reaction thermodynamic calculations, Mo4/3B2(OH)2 and Mo4/3B2F2 are unstable in the presence of alkaline (earth) metal ions due to the surface-conversion reactions between the surface terminations and adsorbates. Meanwhile, the bare Mo4/3B2 and Mo4/3B2O2 monolayers not only can accommodate alkaline (earth) metal ions, but also form stable multi-layer adsorption structures for most of the studied metal ions (Li+, Na+, K+, Mg2+ and Ca2+). The predicted gravimetric capacities of the bare Mo4/3B2 monolayer (Mo4/3B2O2) are 625.9 mA h g−1 (357.3 mA h g−1), 247.20 mA h g−1 (392.1 mA h g−1), 101.8 mA h g−1 (206.4 mA h g−1), 667.0 mA h g−1, and 413.0 mA h g−1 (485.4 mA h g−1) for Li+, Na+, K+, Mg2+ and Ca2+ ions, respectively. The bare Mo4/3B2 exhibits lower onset charging open circuit voltages for alkaline (earth) metal ions than that of Mo4/3B2O2. The diffusivities of the metal ions were revealed to be high on the boridene monolayer especially for the outer fully stable adsorption layers, where the migration energy barriers were found to be less than 0.10 eV. Similar to that of MXenes, the negative electron cloud (NEC) also plays a vital role in stabilizing the observed multi-layer adsorption structures for various metal ions on either the bare Mo4/3B2 or Mo4/3B2O2 monolayer.
1. Introduction
Advanced energy storage devices and equipment play a crucial role in hybrid or electric vehicles, consumption electronics, spacecraft and the national electric grids, all requiring highly efficient battery energy storage systems. Thus, the development of the high-performance electrochemical energy storage devices and equipment is of great significance for better utilization of renewable clean energy such as solar, wind, tidal and geothermal powers. In recent years, metal-ion batteries have attracted increasing attention due to their high energy storage density, outstanding cycling stability and high energy conversion efficiency. Currently, the most widely commercialized metal-ion batteries lithium-ion batteries (LIBs).1–3 However, lithium element is not abundant in the Earth's crust (0.0017 wt%) compared to other alkaline (earth) metals such as Na (2.3 wt%), K (1.5 wt%), Mg (2.9 wt%) and Ca (5.0 wt%). Besides, the extraction of Li metal from its natural ores based on the traditional electrolysis consumes a huge amount of energy, leading to a significant carbon emission footprint, i.e., roughly about 75 kg CO2 is released when making 1 kW h LIB. In comparison, burning fossil fuels such as coal to generate 1 kW h electricity only produces 1 kg CO2 gas.4 Furthermore, besides the high energy and economic costs for the fabrication of LIBs, they also suffers from other disadvantages including safety issues due to the use of flammable organic solvents and the relatively low energy storage power density caused by the sluggish Li ion diffusion dynamics in the electrode materials or electrolyte. Due to the above-mentioned reasons, searching and developing safer and more efficient energy storage systems with both high energy storage capacity and charging–discharging rate capability based on other alkaline (earth) metal ions rather than Li ions have become a hot topic in recent years.5,6
For various rechargeable metal ion batteries, the electrode materials always play a decisive role in determining the ion adsorption capacity and diffusion dynamics. The use of two-dimensional (2-D) materials as electrodes for metal ion batteries can bring additional benefits to boost their electrochemical performance, i.e., large specific surface area, abundant surface adsorption sites and fast ion diffusivity. Thus far, many 2D materials have been either theoretically or experimentally studied for use as electrodes in various ion batteries, i.e., graphene,7–11 hexagonal-BN,12,13 MoS2,14–17 borophene18,19 and transition metal carbides or nitrides (MXenes).20–23 It has been concluded that many 2D materials offer a much higher energy storage capacity (theoretical capacity of >400 mA h g−1) and fast ion diffusion dynamics (diffusion energy barrier height of <0.1 eV) for Li ion batteries compared to the most widely used graphite anode (372 mA h g−1 and 0.3–0.5 eV). Specifically, borophene and other boron-rich materials are theoretically predicted to be superior in theoretical capacity and rate capability for LIBs.18,24 Alternatively, MXenes represent another category of 2D electrode materials, where fast ion diffusion dynamics is prevalent in all alkaline (earth) metal ions.20,22,25,26 Unfortunately, the heavy molar mass of many MXenes greatly limits their capability to achieve a high gravimetric capacity especially in Li ion batteries.27
MBenes denote a large family of two-dimensional materials usually derived from transition metal borides, and which can be prepared in the similar way to MXenes.28–32 However, the crystal structures of MBenes typically consists of a covalently bound B atomic layer sandwiched between two transition metal atomic layers, which is different to that of MXenes. Similar to borophene and other borophene-derived 2D and 3D crystal structures, the boron-rich chemical environment of MBenes promotes a valence electron deficiency condition in the related crystal structures, leading to strong interactions between the metal ions and the electrode materials. It is anticipated that the enhanced chemical interactions between the electron donors (alkaline or alkaline earth metal) and the MBenes are critical to support a multi-layer adsorption mechanism for metal ions, resulting in an ultra-high ion storage capacity (>1000 mA h g−1). Indeed, some previous theoretical calculations based on density functional theory have verified the adsorption mechanism of alkaline (earth) metal ions on MBenes. Jia and coworkers32 predicted the electrochemical properties of multiple M2B2-type MBenes for alkaline metal ion batteries, including V2B2, Cr2B2, Mn2B2, Ti2B2, Zr2B2 and Nb2B2. Notably, these MBenes are derived directly from their corresponding 3D counterparts, i.e., hexagonal MB2 borides, via a probe sonication-assisted delamination method in polar solvents.32 It was found that the obtained theoretical capacities of V2B2, Cr2B2 and Mn2B2 for LIBs can reach 968 mA h g−1, 696 mA h g−1 and 678 mA h g−1, respectively. Meanwhile, for Na ion batteries (NIBs), the predicted capacities are 614 mA h g−1 (V2B2), 491.8 mA h g−1 (Cr2B2) and 482.9 mA h g−1 (Mn2B2). Li et al.33 predicted the high theoretical capacities and low diffusion energy barrier heights using a TiB3 2-D monolayer as the electrode in LIBs and NIBs, i.e., 1335 mA h g−1 (667 mA h g−1) and 0.038 eV (0.157 eV) for LIB (NIB). Liu et al.29 studied the electrochemical performance of surface-functionalized MoBT (T = O, S, Se and Te) monolayers for absorbing Na and K ions. The predicted theoretical capacities of MoBT for an Na ion battery were 110 mA h g−1 (MoBO), 386 mA h g−1 (MoBS), 289 mA h g−1 (MoBSe) and 229 mA h g−1 (MoBTe). Besides, the values for the K ion battery were found to be 110 mA h g−1 (MoBO), 96.5 mA h g−1 (MoBS), 72.2 mA h g−1 (MoBSe) and 57.2 mA h g−1 (MoBTe) in the same work. The relatively low theoretical capacities of MoBT for the Na and K batteries were attributed to the heavy molar mass of the electrode materials, and also the lack of multi-layer adsorption mechanism for alkaline metal ions. In 2021, Dahlqvist and coworkers systematically investigated the thermodynamic stabilities of a large number of layered ternary transition metal borides in both ordered and solid solution forms.34 In their work, it was revealed that 39 chemically ordered (i-MAB) and 52 solid solutions (MAB) are thermodynamically stable among the considered 1092 compositions. Similar to the role of MAX phases in the preparation of MXenes, the MAB phases are the most likely precursors for the fabrication of MBenes.
A recent breakthrough in the synthesis and characterization of MBenes or boridene was reported by Rosen's group.35,36 Based on the successful synthesis of two 3D in-plane chemically ordered (Mo2/3Y1/3)2AlB2 and (Mo2/3Sc1/3)2AlB2 MAB phases, their corresponding 2-D layered counterparts were obtained by selectively etching both Y (Sc) and Al elements in aqueous HF solution. Notably, both precursors could produce the same 2-D monolayer, denoted as Mo4/3B2−xTz, where T refers to the surface terminations (–O, –OH and –F). The chemical composition of boron in the resulting 2D materials was experimentally found to deviate from the ideal value due to the presence of vacancies in the B layer. Furthermore, the alloying of the surface terminations and the resulting catalytic properties of Mo4/3B2−xTz for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) were addressed in ref. 36 using a combination of experimental measurements and first-principles calculations. Boridene represents the first experimentally synthesized 2D transition metal boride, which is very similar to MXenes. Based on previous experimental and theoretical studies on the electrochemical energy storage properties of MXenes and MBenes, it is highly anticipated that the newly synthesized boridene may also exhibit unique electrochemical activities for various metal ion adsorption and transportation, probably leading to a high theoretical capacity and excellent charge/discharge rate capability for use as anodes in alkaline (earth) metal ion batteries.
Herein, we conducted a comprehensive first-principles calculations on the electrochemical performances of bare Mo4/3B2 and chemically functionalized Mo4/3B2Tx (T = –O, –OH and –F) 2-D boridene monolayers for alkaline (earth) metal ions, including Li+, Na+, K+, Mg2+ and Ca2+. For each type of ion battery, the metal ion adsorption preference, theoretical capacity, open circuit voltage and ion diffusion dynamics were predicted. Besides, first-principles molecular dynamics simulations were carried out to elucidate to the possible chemical reactions between the surface terminations and the adsorbed metal ions on boridene. Our work revealed that both bare Mo4/3B2 and Mo4/3B2O2 are promising electrode materials due to their high adsorption capacity and fast ion diffusion dynamics for alkaline (earth) metal ion batteries.
2. Calculation methods and details
In this work, we employed the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP. 5.4.4) to perform all first-principles calculations based on density functional theory (DFT).37–40 All numerical calculations were conducted using the plane wave basis under the three-dimensional (3-D) periodic boundary conditions (PBCs). The projector augmented wave method (PAW) was adopted to describe the valence states in the core regions for all pseudo-atoms.41 The valence orbitals considered for the relevant elements were Mo (4d55s1), B (2s22p1), O (2s22p4), F (2s22p5), H (1s1), Li (2s1), Na (3s1[3p3d]), K (4s1[4p4d]), Mg (3s2[3p3d]) and Ca (4s2[4p4d]). For alkaline (earth) metal atoms, besides the ns state, the np and nd states were also included as valence orbitals to improve the reliability for describing the charge transfer and chemical bonding processes between boridene and absorbed metal ions. For the exchange–correlation effects of electrons, the meta-GGA functional in terms of regularized-restored strongly constrained and approximately normed functional form (r2SCAN) was used.42,43 The overall performance of r2SCAN for the various ground-state properties of the crystal structures was reported to be the same as that of the SCAN functional, but the former exchange–correlation functional is numerically more efficient and robust.44 Besides the normal chemical bonding mechanism, the weak van der Waals interactions may also affect the adsorption energies and structural parameters. However, the use of r2SCAN alone can only capture the intermediate-range van der Waals interactions, where the electron densities of the two fragments are expected to be weakly overlapped. To properly treat the long-range van der Waals interactions, the revised VV10 vdW density functional was employed together with r2SCAN.45 Overall, we used the r2SCAN + rVV10 exchange–correlation functional in all the calculations.46,47 We set the kinetic energy cutoff value to 500 eV for the plane wave expansion in the reciprocal space. The numerical integrations for total energy were conducted using a 2 × 2 × 1 Γ-centered k mesh or 0.05 Å−1 in terms of k-point density in each crystallographic direction. In the current computational settings, the total energy was converged to 10−5 eV per cell and the mean atomic force was reduced to 0.01 eV Å−1.
The atomic structures of bare Mo4/3B2 and surface-terminated Mo4/3B2Tx monolayers were built based on the crystal structures of their parent MAB phases ((Mo2/3Y1/3)2AlB2 and (Mo2/3Sc1/3)2AlB2). The symmetry of the primitive cell of boridene was hexagonal, which was assumed to be the same as the parent MAB phases.35 The hexagonal 2D lattice vectors of boridene were further converted into orthorhombic vectors with the relationships ao = ah, . The crystal structures of boridenes investigated herein were modelled using 2 × 1 supercells of an orthorhombic slab embedded in a periodic box with orthorhombic symmetry. To fully eliminate the fictitious interactions between the periodic images in the z-direction, a vacuum layer of 30 Å was applied in this particular direction of the supercells. In some previous experimental and theoretical calculations, it has been shown that Mo4/3B2 and Mo4/3B2Tx (T = O, OH, and F) are non-magnetic.35,36 Therefore, all the DFT calculations were spin non-polarized. To visualize the crystal structures and analyze the charge density or electron localization function, the VESTA software was employed throughout this work.48
Other computational details regarding the adsorption energy, theoretical capacity, open circuit voltage and diffusion energy barrier height can be found elsewhere in our previous works.27,49
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Crystal structures and stability of Mo4/3B2 and Mo4/3B2Tx
The preparation of boridene by selectively etching Sc (Y) and Al elements from the parent 3D (Mo2/3Sc1/3)2AlB2 or (Mo2/3Y1/3)2AlB2 phases in concentrated aqueous HF solution resulted in the surface functionalization of the bare Mo2/3B2 monolayer. The surface terminations are expected to significantly affect the metal ion adsorption capability and the ion diffusion properties. Therefore, it was necessary to elucidate the thermodynamic stability and crystal structures of Mo2/3B2Tx (T = O, OH and F) first.
In aqueous HF solution, the formation of bare Mo2/3B2 monolayer from the MAB bulk phase is given by eqn (1). The bare boridene monolayer can further react with H2O or HF to produce surface-terminated Mo2/3B2Tx compositions, as denoted by eqn (2)–(4). (1) Mo3/4B2 + xH2O = Mo3/4B2Ox + xH2↑(2) (3) (4)
To determine the saturation value x for each surface termination, the adsorption energy was mapped on the surface of the boridene monolayer for a single chemical group at various adsorption sites, as shown in Fig. 1. The adsorption energy was calculated using eqn (5), as follows: (5)where the first two terms on the right hand side of refer to the total energies of the surface-terminated and bare boridene structures. The last term involves the chemical potentials of the atomic species contained in the surface-functionalized groups (–O, –OH and –F). In our calculations, the chemical potential of H was set to hydrogen gas (H2), while that of the O and F species was defined with respect to H2O (liquid) and HF (gas), respectively. Clearly, we assumed the H-rich condition but poor in either O or F species, which is consistent with the experimental etching conditions. To accelerate the calculations for adsorption energy mapping, only the z-coordinates of the absorbates (–O, –OH and –F) were relaxed. The atomic positions of boridene and x–y coordinates of the adsorbates were all fixed at their starting configurations.

As can be seen in Fig. 1, the predicted adsorption energies for the –O (Fig. 1(a)), –OH (Fig. 1(b)) and –F (Fig. 1(c)) terminations show prominent anisotropic features, indicating the strong adsorption site preference for each surface-functionalized group on the Mo4/3B2 monolayer. It is also worth mentioning that the contour plots of the adsorption energies for the 3 surface terminations show the same hexagonal symmetry as that of the atomic structure of the boridene monolayer. Specifically, 3 distinct high-symmetry adsorption sites can be identified in Fig. 1(d), which are denoted as the hollow site (H), bridge site (B) and top site (T). Obviously, the H-site is located directly above the center of both the Mo and B hexagons, and also directly faces another Mo atom on the other surface of the Mo4/3B2 monolayer. The B-site refers to the bridge position situated between two Mo atoms at one side of the hexagon. Finally, the T-site is placed directly above the Mo atom. The obtained adsorption energies at the 3 adsorption sites for the –O, –OH and –F terminations are presented in Table S1.† According to the calculated adsorption energies, it was found that the H-site is the least stable adsorption position for all 3 surface terminations compared to the B- and T-sites. The B-site gives more negative adsorption energies for the –O, –OH and –F terminations on the Mo4/3B2 monolayer than that of the H- and T-sites. Furthermore, the predicted adsorption energies of the various surface terminations at the B- and T-sites are both significantly more negative than that of the H-site. Therefore, both the B- and T-sites are likely to be simultaneously occupied by the surface terminations in the Mo4/3B2Tx monolayer.
After determining the adsorption preferences for the different surface terminations on the Mo4/3B2 monolayer using the partially constrained optimization method, we calculated the accurate adsorption energies at the H-, B- and T-sites for the three surface terminations by fully relaxing the atomic structures of Mo4/3B2Tx (x = 1/12 for a single adsorbate). The results indicate that the B-site indeed is the most stable among the three adsorption sites. The predicted adsorption energies for –O, –OH and –F are −6.10 eV per cell, −5.95 eV per cell and −5.52 eV per cell, respectively. The T-site represents another stable adsorption position for adsorbates on the Mo4/3B2 monolayer. For the same surface terminations, the adsorption energies were calculated to be −5.35 eV per cell, −5.50 eV per cell and −5.27 eV per cell, respectively. Nevertheless, the obtained adsorption energy of an adsorbate at the T-site is slightly less negative than that at the B-site. Interestingly, the H-site was found to be unstable for both the –O and –OH terminations, given that the adsorbate is spontaneously relaxed to the B-site. However, although the F atom can occupy the H-site, the obtained adsorption energy (−3.25 eV per cell) is significantly less negative than that of either the B-site (−5.52 eV per cell) or T-site (−5.27 eV per cell) in the case of Mo4/3B2F1/12. Table S1† presents a summary of the atomic Bader charges for the surface-functionalized boridenes. As expected, the atomic charges are transferred from the Mo to B and surface groups for Mo4/3B2T1/12. It was found that surface groups receive more charges from the Mo atoms than the B atoms. The charge transfer between the adsorbate and boridene at the B-site was also revealed to be stronger than that of the T-site for all the Mo4/3B2T1/12. The results are in agreement with the predicted adsorption energies at the B- and T-sites. The optimized atomic structures for the different surface groups adsorbed on the bare Mo4/3B2 monolayer are illustrated in Fig. S1–S3 in the ESI.†
Next, we calculated the differential adsorption energy (DAE) to determine the saturation values for x in Mo4/3B2Tx in the –O, –OH and –F surface groups. The DAE is defined by eqn (6). In eqn (6), the chemical potential of a surface group is represented by uT. It should be noted that the chemical ponteials of O (uO) and F (uF) species were already explained using eqn (5). Meanwhile, the chemical potential of the hydroxyl group (–OH) was calculated with respect to H2 gas (uH = E(H2)/2) and uO in liquid H2O. Specifically, the total energy of a single water molecule was obtained using the VASPsol code,50,51 employing an implicit model for treating the solvation effects. Besides, for computing the differential adsorption energy, we gradually increased the total number of attached surface groups to the previously mapped stable adsorption sites on both the upper and lower surfaces of boridene, as shown Fig. 1. ΔEDAE = E(Mo4/3B2Tx+1) − E(Mo4/3B2Tx) − uT(6)

Fig. 2 illustrates the obtained differential adsorption energy versus the number of adsorbates on the boridene monolayer for each surface group at 0 K using eqn (6). As the number of adsorbates (x) gradually increases from x = 0 to the saturation value for each surface group, the obtained differential adsorption energy also steadily shifts from a negative to positive value. According to the above-mentioned definition, a positive adsorption energy indicates that the adsorption is endothermic, and no additional surface group can be accommodated by boridene. The saturation values for x in (Mo4/3B2)12Tx are predicted to be 24 regardless of the considered surface groups. Therefore, we can use Mo4/3B2T2 (T = O, OH and F) to properly denote the fully functionalized boridene monolayer. The crystal structures of Mo4/3B2O2, Mo4/3B2(OH)2 and Mo4/3B2F2 are displayed in Fig. 3(a)–(d). Obviously, all the available B-sites on the surfaces of the bare Mo4/3B2 monolayer are now occupied with the surface groups (–O, –OH and –F), resulting in the highly symmetric atomic structures. Besides, all the T- and H-sites are completely unoccupied. In the case of Mo4/3B2(OH)2, a few O–H bonds are aligned vertically to the boridene surface, while the remaining bonds are slightly tilted with respect to the normal surface. In addition, as can be seen in Fig. 3(b) and (d), the atomic positions of the surface terminations are not coplanar in Mo4/3B2T2 (T = O and F). Besides, in Mo4/3B2O2, the outmost Mo atoms are almost coplanar for bare Mo4/3B2, Mo4/3F2 and Mo4/3B2(OH)2. For the O-terminations, the outmost Mo atomic layers are strongly distorted from the initial coplanar-like configuration in the bare boridene. The very similar structural distortion of the Mo atomic layers in Mo4/3B2O2 was also predicted in ref. 36. The optimized lateral lattice parameters of the bare Mo4/3B2 and Mo4/3B2T2 (T = O, OH and F) are shown in Table 1 for the orthorhombic supercells. The predicted lattice parameters of Mo4/3B2T2 increased compared to that of the bare boridene. Specifically, the lattice parameters of Mo4/3B2O2 were found to be the largest among the investigated boridenes. Meanwhile, the lattice constants of Mo4/3B2F2 are very close to the bare Mo4/3B2 monolayer.
 Fig. 2  Calculated differential adsorption energies as a function of the total number of adsorbates (–O, –OH and –F) on Mo4/3B2 monolayer. The actual number of atoms in the supercell of boridene is indicated as Mo16B24 or (Mo4/3B2)12.

The formation enthalpies of reactions, as shown in eqn (2)–(4), for the various surface terminations were calculated at 0 K and the results are presented in Table 1. The formation enthalpy of Mo4/3B2F2 is predicted to be −3.57 eV per f.u, which is more negative than that of Mo4/3B2O2 (−1.95 eV per f.u) or Mo4/3B2(OH)2 (−2.45 eV per f.u). Therefore, we it can be concluded that –OH and –F are the favored surface terminations considering the reaction thermodynamics. The –O termination is the least favored surface group. In comparison, Helmer and coworkers experimentally determined that the chemical composition of a freestanding boridene film is Mo4/3B1.9O0.3(OH)1.5F0.7 using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.36 Our prediction is quantitatively consistent with the experimental finding. Finally, it should be noted that the most stable surface terminations for MXenes are revealed to be –F and –O, and less –OH groups are expected.52,53 Therefore, the predicted surface terminations of boridene resemble that of MXenes. Finally, it should be noted that all the formation enthalpies presented in Table 1 for the different surface terminations of boridene are very negative, indicating that all the surface terminations (–O, –F and –OH) are thermodynamically stable. Furthermore, the formation enthalpy can be influenced by other factors including the finite temperature effects, chemical potentials of reactant and products, and pH values. It is possible that the surface terminations observed experimentally may differ from our predictions for boridene.
Finally, we aim to briefly address the electronic band structures of the bare and surface-terminated boridenes. The obtained band dispersions are illustrated in Fig. 3(e)–(h) for the relevant crystal structures. Obviously, besides Mo4/3B2O2, the bare, –OH and –F functionalized boridene layers all exhibit metallic-like band structures. Alternatively, Mo4/3B2O2 is considered to be a semiconductor with a predicted direct band gap value of 0.43 eV using r2SCAN-rVV10 density functional. Due to the use of a semi-local functional, the band gap of Mo4/3B2O2 is likely to be underestimated herein. Overall, the bare, –OH- and –F-terminated boridene structures are superior to the –O termination in terms of electrical conductivity according to the obtained electronic band dispersions.
3.2. Single alkaline (earth) metal ion adsorption energy and site preference
Here, we calculated the adsorption energies of the Li metal ions on the bare and surface-terminated boridenes at the various surface sites to elucidate the stable adsorption sites for alkaline (earth) metal ions (Li+, Na+, K+, Mg2+ and Ca2+). The 2-D contour plots of the adsorption energies of a single Li on bare Mo4/3B2, Mo4/3B2O2, Mo4/3B2F2 and Mo4/3B2(OH)2 are illustrated in Fig. 4. The selected high-symmetry adsorption sites and the optimized atomic structures for the other alkaline (earth) metal ions on bare Mo4/3B2 and surface-decorated boridenes are displayed in Fig. S4–S8 in the ESI.†
 Fig. 4  2-D contour plots of the adsorption energy of the Li+ on bare and surface-terminated boridenes, and the selected high-symmetry adsorption sites: (a) bare (Mo4/3B2)12Li; (b) (Mo4/3B2)12O24Li; (c) (Mo4/3B2)12(OH)24Li; (d) (Mo4/3B2)12F24Li; and (e)–(h) the high symmetry adsorption sites. Note that hollow-site (H), bridge-site (B), top-site (T), top-a site (Ta) and top-b site (Tb). 
In the case of the bare Mo4/3B2, the predicted adsorption energies show a strong anisotropic pattern with a hexagonal symmetry, as shown in Fig. 4(a). Three distinct adsorption sites can be identified in Fig. 4(b), i.e., hollow site (H-site), bridge site (B-site) and top site (T-site). Obviously, the most stable adsorption site for a single Li+ on bare Mo4/3B2 is found to be the H-site.
In the case of the Mo4/3B2O2 monolayer, the obtained 2-D contour of the adsorption energy for a single Li+ interestingly exhibits C3 rotational symmetry, as shown in Fig. 4(c). Three high-symmetry adsorption sites on M4/3B2O2 monolayer are shown in Fig. 4(d), i.e., hollow site (H-site), top-a site (Ta-site) and top-b site (Tb-site). Both the Ta and Tb sites are situated directly above the hollow site of the farthest O atoms of the Mo4/3B2O2 monolayer. The main difference between the Ta and Tb sites is ascribed to the bottom Mo atom of boridene. Specifically, Tb site sits on the top of outmost Mo atoms in Mo4/3B2 monolayer. Meanwhile, the Mo layer directly below all the Ta sites is adjacent to the hexagonal B layer (also see Fig. 3(b)) in boridene. According to the obtained adsorption energies, as shown in Fig. 4(c), it can be concluded that the most stable adsorption site for Li+ on Mo4/3B2O2 monolayer refers to Ta site, and the Tb site represents the least stable position for adsorbate. The adsorption energy of the H-site is between that of the Ta and Tb sites for a single Li+ on Mo4/3B2O2.
In the case of Mo4/3B2F2, the adsorption energy results are displayed in Fig. 4(e) and the proposed high-symmetry adsorption sites in Fig. 4(f). Finally, the calculated adsorption energies for the Mo4/3B2(OH)2 monolayer are shown in Fig. 4(g). The proposed high symmetry adsorption sites are depicted in Fig. 4(h). Two distinct adsorption sites are featured for a single Li+ on either the hydroxyl group- or fluorine-terminated boridene, i.e., hollow site (H-site) and top site (T-site). Notably, for both the Mo4/3B2(OH)2 and Mo4/3B2F2 monolayers, Li+ prefers to occupy the H-site. As can be seen in Fig. 4(f) and (h), the predicted adsorption energy at the H-site for Li+ is significantly more negative than that of the T-site. Furthermore, the predicted adsorption energy at the T-site is actually positive in the case of Mo4/3B2(OH)2, indicating that the adsorption of Li+ at this site is thermodynamically unstable. Finally, we also noticed that the 2-D contour plots of the adsorption energy for Mo4/3B2(OH)2 and Mo4/3B2F2 show very complex patterns compared to that of either Mo4/3B2 or Mo4/3B2O2. The results suggest that the adsorption energy landscape for a single alkaline (earth) metal ion on the OH- and F-terminated boridenes is very sensitive to the local atomic structure neighboring the adsorbate.
Based on the 2-D mapping of the adsorption energies for a single Li+ on the bare and surface-terminated boridenes, the most likely high-symmetry adsorption sites are clearly indicated also for other alkaline (earth) metal ions. Fig. 5 shows a summary of the calculated adsorption energies for various alkaline (earth) metal ions on bare Mo4/3B2 and Mo4/3B2T2 (T = O, OH and F). It should be noted that the results shown in Fig. 5 refer to the adsorption of a single metal ion on the boridene monolayer. In the case of bare Mo4/3B2, the most stable adsorption site was found to be the H-site for all the investigated alkaline (earth) metal ions. Meanwhile, the T-site represents the least stable adsorption configuration for all the metal ions. The predicted adsorption energies of the metal ions at B-site are usually situated between that of the H- and T-sites. Besides K+, the adsorption energies of the T- and H-sites are 2–3 times less negative than that of the B-site for each alkaline (earth) metal ions. In the case K+, the adsorptions energies of the B-site (−1.13 eV per cell) and T-site (−1.11 eV) are fairly close, and the values are also close to that of the H-site. Thus, K+ shows a relatively weak adsorption site preference on bare Mo4/3B2 monolayer compared to other metal ions (Li+, Na+, Mg2+ and Ca2+). The predicted adsorption energies of various metal ions on Mo4/3B2F2 and Mo4/3B2(OH)2 show a very similar trend. The H-site was found to be the most stable adsorption configuration for all the alkaline (earth) metal ions, given that the obtained adsorption energies are at least 3-times more negative than that of the T-site for each ion on the Mo4/3B2F2 and Mo4/3B2(OH)2 monolayers. The results for Mo4/3B2O2 imply different adsorption site preferences for Li+ and the other metal ions. Specifically, the occupation of the Ta site is favored by Li+. Otherwise, the H-site is preferred by Na+, K+, Mg2+ and Ca2+ ions. Another interesting finding is that the differences in the adsorption energies among the different adsorption sites for metal ions on either Mo4/3B2O2 or Mo4/3B2F2 monolayer are not significant as that of the bare Mo4/3B2 and Mo4/3B2(OH)2. The effects of the surface terminations on the adsorption energy are also clearly displayed in Fig. 5. For each investigated metal ion, surface terminations can enhance the interactions between the boridene and adsorbate. The magnitude of the predicted adsorption energy at the most stable adsorption site for each metal ion increased in the order of Mo4/3B2, Mo4/3B2(OH)2, Mo4/3B2O2 and Mo4/3B2F2.
 Fig. 5  Adsorption energies of different metal ions (Li+, Na+, K+, Mg2+ and Ca2+) on the surface of bare Mo4/3B2 and surface-functionalized Mo4/3B2T2 boridene structures. 
To understand the underlying physics of the adsorption of various metal ions on bare and surface-functionalized boridenes, we performed Bader charge analysis for all the relevant structures, and the results are displayed in Fig. 6 for the most stable adsorption sites. Firstly, we noted that the Mo element in the surface-terminated boridenes attains a higher valence state than that of Mo in the bare Mo4/3B2 monolayer. Among Mo4/3B2O2, Mo4/3B2(OH)2 and Mo4/3B2F2, the valence state of Mo is higher in the O-terminated boridene than that of either the F- or OH-terminated structure. The adsorption of a single alkaline (earth) metal ion on bare Mo4/3B2 and Mo4/3B2T2 (T = O, OH and F) does not strongly modify the charge state of the Mo atoms in the corresponding monolayers with or without the presence of an adsorbate. For example, the Mo atoms on average loses 0.44 e− to the B atoms in the bare Mo4/3B2 monolayer, and the presence of a single alkaline (earth) metal adsorbate only decreases the valence state of Mo atom from Mo+0.44 to Mo+0.40 (Li+, Na+ and K+) or Mo+0.38 (Mg2+ and Ca2+). Nevertheless, the absorbed metal ion tends to decrease the oxidation state of the Mo atom in all the investigated boridenes. As can be seen in Fig. 6, the alkaline earth metals (Mg and Ca) can lower the oxidation state of the Mo atom more than alkaline metals (Li, Na and K), because the divalent metals can transfer the maximum 2 valence electrons to the boridenes compared to the one-electron transfer mechanism for univalent metals.
 Fig. 6  Bader charge analysis of Mo4/3B2 and Mo4/3B2T2 MBenes and single alkaline (earth) metal ion-adsorbed structures. The plus sign refers to the gain of valence electrons, whereas the minus sign denotes the loss of valence electrons. 
The calculated atomic Bader charges for the alkaline (earth) metal ions exhibit a strong dependence on the surface terminations of the boridenes. As can be seen in Fig. 6, the metal adsorbates lose more valence electrons to Mo3/4B2T2, especially Mo4/3B2O2 and Mo4/3B2F2 compared to the bare Mo4/3B2 monolayer. Consequently, the actual valence states of the alkaline metals (Li, Na and K) and alkaline earth metals (Mg and Ca) absorbed on Mo4/3B2T2 are fairly close to the ideal univalent and divalent ions, respectively. Meanwhile, the B atoms in all the Mo4/3B2T2 boridenes also carry more negative charges than that in the bare Mo4/3B2. It is also interesting to note that the Ca atom transfers less valence electrons to the bare and surface-terminated boridenes than that of Mg. The results are somehow in consistent with the electronegativity values of Mg (1.31) and Ca (1.00). The very similar charge transfer behavior of the Ca adsorbate has been reported before for MXenes.22,53 It is now known that other non-spherical atomic orbitals such as 4p and 4d states also participate in the chemical bonding mechanism when the Ca atom is absorbed on MXenes. Thus, this interpretation can also apply to the Ca atom absorbed on boridenes.
Overall, the Bader charge analysis indicates the presence of strong chemical interactions between the alkaline (earth) metal ions and the boridenes. The significant charge transfer predicted between the adsorbate and substrate supports the formation of an ionic bond between them. Nevertheless, in the cases of Mo4/3B2(OH)2 and Mo4/3B2F2, the predicted adsorption energies at the most stable H-site are very negative for the considered alkaline (earth) metal ions, probably implying that an intense conversion reaction may occur in the Mo4/3B2T2 boridenes in adsorbates. The precise reaction pathways and thermodynamics are presented in Tables S3 and S4.†
3.3. Decomposition of Mo4/3B2T2 (T = O, OH and F) with alkaline (earth) metal adsorbates
In the previous section, it was found that Mo4/3B2(OH)2 and Mo4/3B2F2 can strongly adsorb metal ions on their surfaces. The results imply the direct chemical reaction between the adsorbates and surface groups on the boridene monolayer. Therefore, it is possible that the surface-functionalized boridenes can decompose under the influence of various adsorbates. To elucidate this conversion reaction for Mo4/3B2T2, we performed first-principles molecular dynamics simulations on supercells of M–Mo4/3B2T2–M systems, where M refers to the alkaline (earth) metal slab. Specifically, the sandwich-like M–Mo4/3B2T2–M modelling structures consist of three slabs, i.e., the boridene monolayer is place between two alkaline (earth) metal slabs. The metal slab has three atomic layers, which are made of the most compact crystallographic plane for each considered alkaline (earth) metal. The FPMD simulations were conducted at 300 K for 2.5 ps using the NVT ensemble. The total duration of the FPMD run was sufficiently long to directly observe the decomposition reaction of M–Mo4/3B2T2–M heterostructure.

Fig. 7 illustrates the decomposition reactions of surface-functionalized boridenes with adsorbates for the Li–Mo4/3B2T2–Li structures. Similar FPMD simulations were also carried out for other alkaline (earth) metals, and the results are included in the supporting materials for brevity. For all the investigated M–Mo4/3B2O2–M supercells, the FPMD simulations do not imply a decomposition reaction between O-terminations and adsorbates. As can be seen in Fig. 7(a), the O-terminations do not bind with Li adsorbates to form a separate LixOy layer. Instead, the adsorbed Li species can penetrate the surface groups to directly interact with the bare boridene layer. Eventually, a full layer of Li adsorbates is formed on the upper and lower surfaces of the Mo4/3B2O2 monolayer, as shown in Fig. 7(a). For the other investigated alkaline (earth) metals including Na, K, Mg and Ca, a similar adsorption mechanism is illustrated, as shown in Fig. S9–S13.† In the cases of Mo4/3B2(OH)2 and Mo4/3B2F2, the decomposition of surface terminations with the presence of adsorbates is indeed confirmed by the FPMD simulations. According to Fig. 7(b), (d) and (e), it can be found that the reaction between the Li atoms and OH-terminations can convert Mo4/3B2(OH)2 into the bare Mo4/3B2, subsequently producing the Mo4/3B2Lix composition. Meanwhile, the decomposition reactions of Mo4/3B2F2 follow a similar two-stage reaction mechanism to that of Mo4/3B2(OH)2, i.e., the F-terminations are all stripped away by the Li adsorbates to form bare Mo4/3B2, producing Mo4/3B2Lix in the second stage. This two-stage conversion mechanism is clearly displayed in Fig. 7(c), (f) and (g) for the Li–Mo4/3B2F2–Li heterostructure. After conducting the FPMD simulations for other adsorbates on Mo4/3B2F2 and Mo4/3B2(OH)2, we concluded that the proposed two-state conversion process is universal among the investigated alkaline (earth) metals.
 Fig. 7  Structural evolutions of Li-Mo4/3B2T2-Li sandwich-like heterostructures simulated by FPMD at 300 K: (a) Mo4/3B2O2, (b) and (d), (e) Mo4/3B2(OH)2 and (c) and (f)–(j) Mo4/3B2F2. 
Although the FPMD simulations enabled us to directly inspect the decomposition of the surface-functionalized boridenes with various alkaline (earth) metal adsorbates, these calculations do not provide a quantitative description of the reaction thermodynamics and a precise reaction mechanism. Nevertheless, based on the FPMD simulations, we can propose the exact conversion reactions for the Mo4/3B2T2 boridenes after absorbing various metal ions on their surfaces. The predicted reaction enthalpies following different conversion reaction mechanisms at 0 K are presented in Tables S2–S4.† In the case of the Mo4/3B2O2 monolayer, the proposed decomposition reactions for alkaline (earth) metal ions are given by eqn (7) and (8), as follows: Mo4/3B2O2 + 4 M = Mo4/3B2 + 2M2O M = Li, Na and K(7) Mo4/3B2O2 + 2 M = Mo4/3B2 + 2MO M = Mg and Ca(8)
The reaction enthalpies of eqn (7) and (8) were calculated for alkaline (earth) metal ions at 0 K. For simplicity, the temperature effects (atomic vibration enthalpy and vibration entropy) were completely ignored to compute the reaction thermodynamics herein. For Li, Na and K, the calculated reaction enthalpies were found to be −1.30 eV per Li, −0.47 eV per Na and −0.04 eV per K, respectively. The values for Mg and Ca were predicted to be −2.68 eV per Mg and −3.13 eV per Ca, respectively. Clearly, the adsorbates such as Li, Mg and Ca show strong tendency to react with the O-terminations, forming Li2O, MgO and CaO, respectively. This reaction mechanism is not strongly favored by Na and K considering the reaction thermodynamics compared to other alkaline (earth) metal ions. Interestingly, the formation of a separate MxOy (M = Li, Na, K, Mg and Ca) layer on the Mo4/3B2O2 monolayer in the adsorbates is not clearly observed in the FPMD simulations (see Fig. S9–S13†). Certainly, the reaction pathways shown in eqn (7) and (8) must compete with another likely reaction mechanism, i.e., the reaction that forms the Mo4/3B2O2Mx composition. Certainly, as shown in Fig. 5, the adsorption energies representing the formation of Mo4/3B2O2Mx structures are predicted to be strongly negative for the O-terminated boridene. Therefore, the strong tendency for stripping the O-terminations from Mo4/3B2O2 due to the formation of alkaline (earth) metal oxides is significantly suppressed. Mo4/3B2F2 + 2 M = Mo4/3B2 + 2MF M = Li, Na and K(9) Mo4/3B2F2 + M = Mo4/3B2 + MF2 M = Mg and Ca(10)
In the case of Mo4/3B2F2, we propose eqn (9) and (10) to denote the conversion reactions between the F-terminations and adsorbates. The calculated reaction enthalpies are −1.87 eV per Li, −1.60 eV per Na and −1.32 eV per K for the formation of LiF, NaF and KF, respectively. Alternatively, the formation of MgF2 and CaF2 gives −2.55 eV per Mg and −3.87 eV per Ca as the reaction enthalpies, following the reaction pathway given by eqn (10), respectively. The above-mentioned calculations imply that the alkaline earth metal adsorbates (Mg and Ca) show strong tendency to react with surface F-terminations to form MF2 fluorites in Mo4/3B2F2 compared to that of alkaline metals (Li, Na and K). Among the alkaline metal adsorbates, the proposed conversion reaction shown in eqn (9) is more likely to occur between Mo4/3B2F2 and Li or Na than K. The other most likely competing reactions to eqn (9) and (10) are mainly attributed to the formation of either Mo4/3B2F2 or Mo4/3B2F2Mx (M = Li, Na, K, Mg and Ca). The FPMD simulations nicely agree with our thermodynamic calculations. As can be seen in Fig. S9–S13,† the F atoms are quickly detached from the boridene surfaces, which further gradually diffused into the adsorbate layers to form MF or MF2 fluorites in the cases of Li, Na, Mg and Ca as the adsorbates. Although, the absorbed K atoms can still strip the F-terminations, the reaction kinetics observed from FPMD simulation (see Fig. S11†) were found to be very slow. Overall, the F-terminations are not stable against the absorbed alkaline (earth) metal ions due to the chemical conversion reactions given by eqn (9) and (10).
Finally, for Mo4/3B2(OH)2, the decomposition reactions may follow two different pathways. In the first reaction mechanism between the OH-terminations and adsorbates, the formation of alkaline metal hydroxides such as MOH (M = Li, Na and K) and M(OH)2 (M = Mg and Ca) are proposed. We can use eqn (11) and (12) to denote this conversion reaction. Mo4/3B2(OH)2 + 2 M = Mo4/3B2 + 2MOH M = Li, Na and K(11) Mo4/3B2(OH)2 + M = Mo4/3B2 + M(OH)2 M = Mg and Ca(12)
For Mo4/3B2(OH)2, another conversion mechanism may also apply to all the investigated alkaline (earth) metal ions. The new conversion reaction pathways consist of two stages. In the first stage, the alkaline (earth) metals directly react with the surface OH-terminations, liberating the H2 gas and producing O-terminated boridene. In the second stage, Mo4/3B2O2 continues to consume the adsorbates through the decomposition reactions of eqn (7) and (8). The overall decomposition reactions for the various alkaline (earth) metals are summarized in eqn (13) and (14). Mo4/3B2(OH)2 + 4 M = Mo4/3B2 + 2M2O + H2↑ M = Li, Na and K(13) Mo4/3B2(OH)2 + 2 M = Mo4/3B2 + 2MO + H2↑ M = Mg and Ca(14)
The formation enthalpies for eqn (11) and (12) were calculated to be −1.09 eV per Li (LiOH), −0.82 eV per Na (NaOH), −0.65 eV per K (KOH), −2.17 eV per Mg (Mg(OH)2) and −2.87 eV per Ca (Ca(OH)2), respectively. Regarding the second conversion reactions shown in eqn (13) and (14), the predicted formation enthalpies are −1.17 eV per Li (Li2O + H2), −0.34 eV per Na (Na2O + H2), + 0.09 eV per K (K2O + H2), −2.43 eV per Mg (MgO + H2) and −2.87 eV per Ca (CaO + H2). The above-mentioned calculations indicate that the chemical reactions between the Li and Mg adsorbates and Mo4/3B2(OH)2 may proceed by the formation of metal oxides and release of H2 gas. Besides, the formation of metal hydroxides (NaOH or KOH) is favored by the formation enthalpy of Na and K species. In the case of Ca, both Ca(OH)2 and CaO can be produced from the proposed conversion reactions, i.e., eqn (12) and (14). Our FPMD simulations again confirm the thermodynamic evaluations for possible conversion reactions between alkaline (earth) metal ion adsorbates and Mo4/3B2(OH)2.
By employing both first-principles molecular dynamics simulations and reaction thermodynamics evaluation, we concluded that the decomposition of Mo4/3B2T2 (T = F and OH) boridenes with alkaline (earth) metal adsorbates into bare Mo4/3B2 and other products (metal oxides, metal hydroxides and H2) is highly favorable. However, the conversion of Mo4/3B2O2 to bare boridene and metal oxides (MO or M2O) by eqn (7) and (8) is more likely to occur for Li, Mg and Ca. This decomposition mechanism is less favored by Na and K for Mo4/3B2O2. Xie and coworkers investigated the reaction thermodynamics of the decomposition of surface-functionalized MXenes (Ti2CTx, V2CTx, Nb2CTx and Ti3C2Tx) after adsorbing alkaline (earth) metal ions (Li+, Na+, K+, Mg2+ and Ca2+), and very similar conversion reactions were proposed.22 In our previous work, first-principles molecular dynamics simulations were conducted for M-(Mo2/3Sc1/3)2CTx (T = O, OH and F, and M refer to alkaline (earth) metals) systems, and it was found that only (Mo3/2Sc1/3)2CF2 could be converted into bare (Mo2/3Sc1/3)2C through a decomposition process similar to that of eqn (9) or (10).53 Wang et al.27 discussed the possible decomposition of Li-Mo2M′C2T2 (M′ = Sc, Ti, V, Zr, Nb, Hf and Ta; T = O, H, OH and F) structures for LIBs, concluding that both OH- and F-terminated o-MXenes can be converted into bare structures following reaction pathways similar to that of eqn (9)–(14). Overall, for both MXenes and boridenes, the conversion reactions are predicted to be similar, implying a new synthetic route to fabricate bare 2-D materials without surface terminations.
For either boridenes or MXenes, experimental studies on the surface decomposition reactions and their reversibility are scarce. Anasori and coworkers proposed a two-stage conversion mechanism for OH-terminated Mo-based MXenes in LIBs during the charge–discharge cycles.54 In the first lithiation process, the OH-groups react with the Li metal atoms to produce an O-terminated MXene monolayer with Li adsorbates. In the second stage, the decomposition of lithiated O-terminated MXene results in the formation of a bare MXene monolayer and Li2O. Those two stages were found to happen at different voltages in the measured cyclic voltammetry curves experimentally.54 Recently, Maughan et al.55 prepared pillared Mo2TiC2T2 (T = O and OH) MXenes and investigated their electrochemical properties for use as electrodes in LIBs and NIBs. Employing in situ spectroscopic measurements including XPS and solid-state NMR (SS-NMR), it was concluded that the conversion reactions of Mo2TiCO2 and Mo2TiC2(OH)2 can produce Li2O and LiOH reversibly during the charge–discharge cycle. Notably, similar conversion reactions were not observed between O- or OH-terminated MXenes and Na adsorbates. Consequently, the experimental capacity of Mo2TiC2T2 for LIBs is significantly higher than that of NIB. Certainly, the reversibility of the conversion reactions between alkaline (earth) metal adsorbates and surface-functionalized boridenes plays a decisive role in determining their charge–discharge cyclic stability and efficiency, but experimental works are needed to fully address their reaction kinetics in the future.
3.4. Theoretical capacities
The theoretical capacity plays a crucial role in determining the energy storage density of an electrode material. Both FPMD simulations and the thermodynamic calculations presented before indicate that Mo4/3B2F2 and Mo4/3B2(OH)2 are unstable against alkaline (earth) metal adsorbates. IN the case of F- and OH-terminated boridenes, the decomposition reactions result in the formation of a bare Mo4/3B2 monolayer. Besides, the bare Mo4/3B2 and Mo4/3B2O2 show no decomposition reactions under the influence of adsorbed alkaline (earth) metal ions. Hereafter, the electrochemical properties for storing alkaline (earth) metal ions were mainly investigated for the bare and O-terminated Mo4/3B2 monolayers.
To obtain the theoretical capacities of Mo4/3B2 and Mo4/3B2O2 for alkaline (earth) metal ion batteries, the maximum number of adsorbates was determined based on the calculation of the differential adsorption energy for each metal ion species. The differential adsorption energy was calculated as a function of the total number of adsorbates, and the results for Mo4/3B2 and Mo4/3B2O2 are illustrated in Fig. 8(a) and (b), respectively. For each metal ion, the predicted differential adsorption energy profile for either bare or O-terminated boridenes eventually turns positive when saturation is reached for the alkaline (earth) metal ions, as shown in Fig. 8. Upon closer inspection of the variation in the differential adsorption energy with respect to the total number of adsorbates of Mo4/3B2 for each metal ion species, we observed two plateaus in the obtained profile. The differential adsorption energy does not vary monotonically with an increase in the total number of adsorbates in the plateaus. In the case of Mo4/3B2O2, similar plateaus were also seen in the differential adsorption energy profiles for alkaline (earth) metal ions, but are less obvious than that of the bare Mo4/3B2 monolayer. Given that the differential adsorption energy profile was obtained by gradually adding the adsorbate to the boridene monolayer, it enabled us to directly identify the correlation between the adsorption atomic structures and the adsorption energy. Interestingly, it was revealed that each plateau represents the formation of a stable full adsorbate layer on upper or lower surface of the boridene monolayer. As shown in Fig. 9, the bare and O-terminated boridenes are fully saturated with various metal ions. Besides potassium, other alkaline (earth) metal ions can form multiple stable adsorption layers on the bare Mo4/3B2 monolayer, i.e., three layers for Li+ (Fig. 9(a)) and two for Na+ (Fig. 9(b)), Mg2+ (Fig. 9(d)) and Ca2+ (Fig. 9(e)). For the bare Mo4/3B2, potassium can only form a single stable adsorption layer on the upper and lower surfaces, as shown in Fig. 9(c). In the case of O-terminated boridene, stable multi-layer adsorption configurations are predicted for Li+ (Fig. 9(f)), Na+ (Fig. 9(g)), K+ (Fig. 9(h)) and Ca2+ (Fig. 9(i)). In contrast, Mg2+ does not form a stable multi-layer adsorption structure on the Mo4/3B2O2 monolayer. Due to the relatively small ionic radii of Li+ (0.90 Å) and Mg2+ (0.86 Å), their atoms in the first stable full adsorption layer are almost coplanar with that of the Mo atoms in the boridene monolayer, indicating that the adsorbates occupy the vacancies left behind by the Y or Sc atoms in the parent (Mo2/3M1/3)2AlB2 (M = Y or Sc) phases. The other investigated metal ions such as Na+ (1.16 Å) and Ca2+ (1.14 Å) can partially fill the vacancies in the boridenes, as clearly depicted in Fig. 9(b), (e), (g) and (i). For K+ (1.52 Å), its ionic radius is too large to fit in the vacancies on either the bare or O-terminated boridene (see Fig. 9(c) and (h), respectively). Consequently, the adsorbed K+ ions form a separate layer sitting on the top of the Mo atoms.

Li, B, O, Na, Mg, K, Ca and Mo are denoted by light-green, green, red, yellow, orange, purple, light-blue and light-purple spheres, respectively. 
Finally, it is also worth noting that all atomic structures shown in Fig. 10 for various alkaline (earth) metal ions absorbed on the bare and O-terminated boridenes are found to be highly ordered. The observed structural ordering in the adsorbate layers is certainly related to the strong adsorption site preference for a metal ion on the top of each lower atomic layer. The adsorption of metal ions on the boridene monolayer is illustrated to show the strong anisotropic adsorption energy landscape in Fig. 4, using Li+ as an example. The metal ions prefer to reside on the most stable adsorption sites. Therefore, the formation of a highly ordered atomic configuration for the first stable full adsorption layer can be explained. To verify whether this structural ordering mechanism also applies to other adsorbate layers, we also display the 2-D contour plots of the adsorption energies of a single metal ion (Li+, Na+, Mg2+ and Ca2+) absorbed on the first full stable metal ion layer for the bare Mo4/3B2 monolayer in Fig. 10. In the case of Li+ and Mg2+, the first full stable adsorption layer is actually intermixed with an Mo layer in boridene, as explained before. As can be seen in Fig. 10(a) and (e), the predicted adsorption energy landscape for either ion is highly symmetric, allowing three high-symmetry adsorption sites to be clearly identified in Fig. 10(b) and (f), i.e., hollow-site, bridge-site and top-site. Meanwhile, the calculated adsorption energy patterns shown in Fig. 10(c) and (g) for Na+ and Ca2+ are also anisotropic and ordered, respectively. However, only two high-symmetry adsorption sites (bridge-site and top-site) are indicated in Fig. 10(d) and (h) for these two metal ions adsorbed on the first stable full layer, respectively. These calculations provide a reasonable explanation for the formation of highly ordered atomic configurations for various metal ions in the multi-layer adsorption mechanism.

The high-symmetry adsorption sites including hollow site (H), bridge site (B) and top site (T) are shown. 
In Fig. 9, the maximum number of metal ions absorbed on the bare or O-terminated boridene for each ion species is indicated by the chemical formula. The theoretical capacities of the bare Mo4/3B2 and Mo4/3B2O2 for storing various alkaline (earth) metal ions were calculated and displayed in Fig. 8(c). For bare Mo4/3B2, we predicted the relatively high energy storage capacities for Li+, Mg2+ and Ca2+ ions to be 625.88 mA h g−1, 666.98 mA h g−1 and 413.04 mA h g−1, respectively. The theoretical capacities of Na+ and K+ were found to be 247. 20 mA h g−1 and 101.77 mA h g−1 for the bare Mo4/3B2. Thus, the bare Mo4/3B2 monolayer showed a relatively poor ion storage performance for the potassium ion battery (KIB) compared to the other alkaline (earth) metal ion batteries. The low theoretical capacity of Mo4/3B2 for K+ is obviously attributed to the lack of multi-layer adsorption mechanism and the heavy molar mass of boridene and the adsorbates. In the case of Mo4/3B2O2, the obtained theoretical capacities for the alkaline (earth) metal ions are 357.34 mA h g−1 (Li+), 392.07 mA h g−1 (Na+), 206.42 mA h g−1 (K+) and 385.44 mA h g−1 (Ca2+). Notably, the energy storage capacities increased for Na+ and K+ with O-terminations compared to that of the bare Mo4/3B2 for the same ions. Obviously, the boosted theoretical capacities of Mo4/3B2O2 for either Na+ or K+ ions are attributed to the enhanced interactions between the O-terminations and adsorbates, directly leading to a multi-layer adsorption mechanism for both ion species, as shown in Fig. 9(g) and (h), respectively. In contrast, this multi-layer adsorption mechanism is absent in the bare Mo4/3B2 for Na+ and K+ ions. Specifically, as shown in Fig. 9(g), Mo4/3B2O2 can accommodate 3 Na atomic layers on both its upper and lower surfaces compared to the only 2 full Na layers on the surfaces of bare Mo4/3B2 (see Fig. 9(b)). For the K+ ions, 3 stable adsorbate layers are formed on both surfaces of Mo4/3B2O2 (Fig. 9(h)), but only a single full adsorption layer is realized in the Mo4/3B2 monolayer on either side (Fig. 9(c)). In the case of Li+ and Ca2+, the theoretical capacities of Mo4/3B2O2 are predicted to be lower than that of bare Mo4/3B2. The observed reduction in Li+ ion adsorption capacity of Mo4/3B2O2 is directly related to the decrease in the number of adsorbates, i.e., Mo4/3B2Li4.17versus Mo4/3B2O2Li2.67. Besides, Mo4/3B2O2Ca1.83 contains more Ca2+ ions than that in Mo4/3B2Ca1.67, but the molar mass of the former is larger than that of the latter, diminishing the possible advantage of using Mo4/3B2O2 for storing Ca2+ ions to achieve a higher gravimetric capacity.
The theoretical capacities of several MBenes were addressed before in the literature.24,25,28,29,32,33 Jia et al.32 found that the theoretical capacities of V2B2, Cr2B2 and Mn2B2 for LIB can reach 968 mA h g−1, 696 mA h g−1 and 678 mA h g−1, respectively. In addition, the calculated adsorption capacities were 614 mA h g−1 (V2B2), 491.8 mA h g−1 (Cr2B2) and 482.9 mA h g−1 (Mn2B2) for Na ion batteries (NIBs). Interestingly, the theoretical capacities of the surface-functionalized MoBT (T = O, S, Se and Te) monolayers for absorbing Na+ ions were calculated to be 110 mA h g−1 (MoBO), 386 mA h g−1 (MoBS), 289 mA h g−1 (MoBSe) and 229 mA h g−1 (MoBTe), respectively.29 Meanwhile, the predicted values for KIB were 110 mA h g−1 (MoBO), 96.5 mA h g−1 (MoBS), 72.2 mA h g−1 (MoBSe) and 57.2 mA h g−1 (MoBTe) in the same work.29 Obviously, higher energy storage capacities were obtained for the 3d transition metal MBenes than that of the Mo-based boridenes in the case of NIB and KIB. However, the Na+ and K+ ion storage capacities of the bare Mo4/3B2 and Mo4/3B2O2 are superior to that of MoBT (T = O, S, Se and Te). It seems that the heavy molar mass of the Mo-based boridenes is a fundamental disadvantage to achieve even higher gravimetric capacities for alkaline (earth) metal ion batteries with the presence of multi-layer adsorption mechanism.
Recently, Zhou and coworkers theoretically screened a large number of layered materials for multivalent ion batteries including Mg2+, Ca2+ and Na+ ions.2,6 In the case of the Ca-ion battery, the predicted ion-storage capacities of the selected candidate compounds were in the range of 138 mA h g−1 (CaV4O9) to 625 mA h g−1 (Ca(BC)2). Besides, the theoretical capacities of the Mg-ion battery can exceed 184 mA h g−1 for all candidates. In the case of the Na-ion battery, the theoretical capacities of several candidate compounds such as Na(CuO)2, NaTiF4, Na2Zr(CuS2)2, Na3Co2SbO6 and Na2Cu(CO3)2 were found to be 147.2 mA h g−1, 182.5 mA h g−1, 136.5 mA h g−1, 198.7 mA h g−1 and 233.5 mA h g−1, respectively. Therefore, it can be concluded that boridenes are at least comparable or even slightly superior to the aforementioned novel layered electrode materials in Mg2+, Ca2+ and Na+ ion-storage capacities for various ion batteries.
Finally, we compared the theoretical capacities of boridenes with that of MXenes for the same alkaline (earth) metal ion batteries. For Mo-based ordered double-transition metal MXenes (o-MXenes), their theoretical capacity for LIB was reported to be around 195 mA h g−1.27 Gravimetric capacities higher than 400 mA h g−1 were predicted for mono-transition metal MXenes such as Ti2C (Ti2CO2), V2C (V2CO2), Nb2C (Nb2CO2), and Ti3C2 (Ti3C2O2). For Na and K ion batteries, Ti-based mono-transition metal MXenes (Ti2C and Ti3C2) could provide theoretical capacities of above 200 mA h g−1.22 The predicted gravimetric capacities of Mo-based double-transition metal i-MXenes for NIB and KIB were below 200 mA h g−1.53 Finally, in the case of bare mono-transition metal MXenes including Ti2C, V2C, Nb2C and Ti3C2, their energy storage capacities for Mg and Ca ion batteries were reported to be higher than 400 mA h g−1 and 300 mA h g−1, respectively.22 For the same MXenes within O-terminations, the obtained theoretical capacities of the Mg or Ca ion battery were still higher than 350 mA h g−1. In the case of Mo-based i-MXenes, the bare (Mo2/3Sc1/3)2C gave 490 mA h g−1 and 288 mA h g−1 for Mg and Ca ion batteries, respectively.53 Meanwhile, (Mo2/3Sc1/3)2CO2 could provide 436 mA h g−1 (Mg2+) and 256 mA h g−1 (Ca2+).53 In conclusion, the energy storage capacities of boridenes for alkaline (earth) metal ion batteries are comparable to that of mono-transition metal MXenes, which are superior to Mo-based o-MXenes or i-MXenes.
3.5. Open circuit voltages (OCVs)
According to the reaction thermodynamics, the OCV evaluates the reversibility of the half-cell electrochemical reaction in the charge–discharge cycles, as clearly implied by the Nernst equation. Generally, a relatively low OCV is required for anode materials to ensure a highly reversible charging–discharging process. For bare Mo4/3B2 and Mo4/3B2O2, the obtained OCV versus capacity profiles are displayed in Fig. 11(a) and (b), respectively. Besides, the mean OCVs were also calculated for alkaline (earth) metal ion batteries, and the results are shown in Fig. 11(c).
 Fig. 11  Calculated open circuit voltages (OCVs) of boridenes for alkaline (earth) metal ion batteries: (a) bare Mo4/3B2 and (b) Mo4/3B2O2; and (c) mean OCVs for various ion batteries. 
The observed multiple plateaus in the OCV versus capacity profiles for various metal ion batteries can be understood from the definition of the OCV value, as given by eqn (15), where M refers to the alkaline (earth) metal ion, x1 and x2 represent the total numbers of adsorbates at the two different charging stages, and z denotes the total number of electrons transferred for the half-cell reaction. (15)
For all the obtained OCV profiles, the metal intercalation voltage decreased with an increase in capacity. The onset charging voltages were predicted to be around 2.5 V for Ca2+ and Mg2+, 1.8 V for Li+, and 1.6 V for Na+ and K+ in the case of bare Mo4/3B2. Meanwhile, for Mo4/3B2O2, the onset voltages are much higher than that of the bare Mo4/3B2 for the same metal ions. Specifically, the values were calculated to be 5.1 V (Ca2+), 3.4 V (K+), 3.1 V (Na+) and 2.6 V (Li+) for Mo4/3B2O2. The increase in the charge voltage of Mo4/3B2O2 is obviously attributed to the enhanced chemical interactions between the adsorbates and boridene monolayer compared to that of the bare Mo4/3B2. However, one should be cautious about the predicted large onset charging voltages for some alkaline metal ions especially Ca2+. A high onset charging voltage may also imply the poor irreversibility of the half-cell reaction in the discharging process.
The obtained mean OCVs are less than 1.5 V for all the studied alkaline (earth) metal ion batteries in the case of bare Mo4/3B2, i.e., 0.55 V (Li+), 0.89 V (Na+), 1.49 V (K+), 0.90 V (Mg2+) and 1.17 V (Ca2+). Regarding Mo4/3B2O2, these values were predicted to be higher than 1.5 V for Li+ (1.83 V) and Ca2+ (2.95 V). In contrast, the mean OCVs of Na+ and K+ for Mo4/3B2O2 are 0.94 V and 1.18 V, respectively. Finally, it is worth mentioning that the anode materials used in LIBs should exhibit an OCV of less than 1.0 V to suppress the growth of Li metal dendrites during the charging process. Unfortunately, the optimal OCV windows for other alkaline metal ion batteries have not been fully established experimentally. Overall, the bare Mo4/3B2 monolayer has a suitable OCV window for use as an anode in LIBs particularly. The ideal OCV windows for Ca- and Mg-ion batteries are reported to be 1.5–3.5 V in ref. 6. Based on this, the predicted OCV values of the bare boridenes for Mg- and Ca-ion batteries slightly deviate from the ideal OCV range. Meanwhile, the obtained OCV values of Mo4/3B2O2 for the Mg- and Ca-ion batteries fall in the ideal range.
3.6. Diffusion dynamics of alkaline (earth) metal ions on boridenes
The diffusion dynamics of metal ions governs the energy storage power density and the charging–discharging rate capability. Fig. 12 shows the investigated diffusion pathways for various alkaline (earth) metal ions on the bare and O-terminated boridenes. Here, we only show the diffusion routes related to the first full stable layer. The diffusion pathways of the second and third full stable layers and their corresponding energy versus diffusion coordinate profiles are presented in the ESI (see Fig. S20–S30†). As shown in Fig. 12(a), the bare Mo4/3B2 has two characteristic diffusion routes for metal ions on the first full stable layer, i.e., a short pathway connecting the two nearest hollow sites (Path-1) and a long pathway connecting two non-neighboring hollow sites (Path-2). Alternatively, in the case of the Mo4/3B2O2 monolayer, two diffusion routes were investigated, including a zig-zag-like diffusion process between two neighboring hollow sites (Path-3) and a straight migration path connecting two non-neighboring hollow sites (Path-4, a very similar pathway to that of Path-2 on bare boridene).
 Fig. 12  Proposed migration pathways of alkaline (earth) metal ions on boridenes: (a) bare Mo4/3B2 and (b) Mo4/3B2O2. 
Using the CI-NEB approach, the predicted diffusion energy profiles for various alkaline (earth) metal ions on boridenes are depicted in Fig. 13. Firstly, it was discovered that the obtained diffusion energy barrier heights for Path-1 and Path-2 in the bare Mo4/3B2 for each alkaline (earth) metal ion are fairly close, i.e., 1.31 eV versus 1.42 eV for Li+ (Fig. 13(a)), 0.83 eV versus 0.88 eV for Na+ (Fig. 13(b)), 0.53 eV versus 0.55 eV for K+ (Fig. 13(c)), 2.17 eV versus 2.35 eV for Mg2+ (Fig. 13(d)) and 1.62 eV versus 1.72 eV for Ca2+ (Fig. 13(e)), respectively. Secondly, for the bare Mo4/3B2, both Li+ and Mg2+ exhibit much higher diffusion energy barrier heights than other alkaline (earth) metal ions on the same migration pathway. This observation is directly related to the smaller ionic radii of Li+ and Mg2+ compared to that of Na+, K+ and Ca2+. Consequently, Li+ and Mg2+ can occupy the vacancies in the Mo atomic layer in bare Mo4/3B2, forming a coplanar-like first full stable adsorption layer with Mo atoms (see Fig. 9(a) and (d)). In the case K+, the predicted energy barrier heights for Path-1 (0.53 eV) and Path-2 (0.55 eV) are the smallest among the investigated alkaline (earth) metal ions. This is mainly because K+ has the largest ionic radius and its first full stable layer is completely separated from the atomic layers of Mo4/3B2 monolayer (see Fig. 9(c)). Meanwhile, the ionic radii of Na+ and Ca2+ are situated in the range of that of Li+, Mg2+ and K+. The first full stable adsorption layers for these adsorbates are placed close to the outmost Mo atoms in the Mo4/3B2 monolayer (Fig. 9(b) and (e)). Therefore, alkaline (earth) metal ions such as Li+, Na+, Mg2+ and Ca2+ may experience the strong steric effects during their migration. In summary, the predicted diffusion energy barriers for alkaline (earth) metal ions in the first full stable layer on the bare Mo4/3B2 monolayer are all above 0.5 eV.
 Fig. 13  Obtained diffusion energy profiles of different diffusion pathways for alkaline (earth) metal ions on bare Mo4/3B2 and Mo4/3B2O2: (a) Li+; (b) Na+; (c) K+; (d) Mg2+; and (e) Ca2+. In the case of Mg2+, the formation of a full stable layer is predicted to be unstable using FPMD simulation at 300 K. 
Regarding the diffusion of metal ions on the Mo4/3B2O2 monolayer, the obtained migration energy profiles for Path-3 and Path-4 are shown in Fig. 13 for Li+, Na+, K+ and Ca2+ ions. The diffusion energy barrier heights were found to be 0.66 eV (0.89 eV), 0.24 eV (0.68 eV) and 0.48 eV (0.74 eV) for Li+, Na+ and K+ in the case of Path-3 (Path-4). For Ca2+, the diffusion barriers significantly increased, i.e., 2.36 eV (Path-3) and 3.39 eV (Path-4), compared to that of the alkaline metal ions. As can be seen in Fig. 13(a) and 15(b), Li+ and Na+ ions adsorbed on Mo4/3B2O2 show lower diffusion energy barriers than that of bare Mo4/3B2. The opposite results are shown in Fig. 13(e) for Ca2+. In the case of K+, the favorable diffusion pathway (Path-3) has a comparable energy barrier to that of the bare boridene.
Due to the presence of a multi-layer adsorption structure and charge-screening effects among the adsorbate layers, the diffusion energy barrier height is expected to show a strong dependence on the layer position. It is anticipated that the alkaline (earth) metal ions in the outer adsorption layers will exhibit higher nobilities than that in the first full stable layer. Here, Fig. 14 shows the obtained diffusion energy barriers for the adsorbates in different full stable layers. In general, the migration energy barrier heights decreased in the order of the inner most full layer, the second full layer and the outmost full layer for the studied adsorbates especially in the case of the bare Mo4/3B2 monolayer. As can be seen in Fig. 14, Li+, Na+, Mg2+ and Ca2+ can form multiple stable full layers on the bare boridene. For these four metal ions, the predicted diffusion energy barrier for the first stable full layer is larger than 0.83 eV. Notably, the migration energies of the second stable full layer are reduced to 0.22 eV, 0.20 eV, 0.04 eV and 0.04 eV for Mg2+, Ca2+, Na+ and Li+, respectively. For Li+, the ion mobility in the third full stable layer was found to be even higher than that in the second full stable layer, i.e., 0.01 eV (the third layer) versus 0.04 eV (the second layer). For Mo4/3B2O2, we predict an increase in the diffusion energy barriers for the second full stable layer in the case of Na+ and K+ ions compared to that of the first full stable layer. For the same metal ions, the obtained diffusion energy barriers again decreased to 0.03 eV (Na+) and 0.08 eV (K+). Overall, the diffusion energy barriers were indeed found to be large for all the adsorbates in the first full layer, and the ion mobilities are expected to be high in the second or the third full layer for alkaline (earth) metal ions on boridenes.
 Fig. 14  Predicted diffusion energy barrier heights of various alkaline (earth) metal ions belonging to different full stable layers on bare Mo4/3B2 and Mo4/3B2O2 boridenes. 
Finally, we compared the predicted diffusion energy barrier heights of the bare and O-terminated boridenes for various ion batteries with other candidate compounds suggested previously for use as electrode materials.2,6 For some novel Ca-containing layered compounds, the calculated migration energy barrier heights of Ca2+ were found to be in the range of 0.92 eV to 4.14 eV. For Mg-containing candidate compounds, the obtained barrier heights of Mg2+ are reported to be higher than 1.06 eV. In the case of Na-containing compounds, the migration energies of Na+ were calculated to be less than 0.69 eV. Therefore, the ion migration energies of the bare and O-terminated boridenes are comparable to that of the novel candidate compounds for Na+, Mg2+ and Ca2+ ions.
3.7. Multi-layer adsorption mechanism for metal ions in boridenes
The presence of a multi-layer adsorption mechanism for alkaline (earth) metal ions is critical to significantly boost the energy storage capacities of bare and surface-functionalized boridenes. The multi-layer adsorption process has been reported before in MXenes and MBenes.22 Here, we aim to further address the underlying physics of the multi-layer adsorption process for metal ions on a boridene monolayer by analyzing the layer-resolved adsorption energy and atomic Bader charges, the charge density difference and electron localization function (ELF).
The calculated electron density differences are illustrated for the Li-Mo4/3B2 and Na-Mo4/3B2O2 systems at the different charging stages in Fig. 15. Both systems exhibit the characteristic multi-layer adsorption mechanism, which can accommodate 3 alkaline (earth) metal ions on either side of the monolayer. For the bare Mo4/3B2, in the case of a single Li+ absorbed on the monolayer, the electron density is accumulated at the neighboring Mo atoms on boridene, as shown in Fig. 15(a). After establishing the first full adsorption layer of Li atoms on Mo4/3B2, we observed the charge accumulations in the space between Mo atoms and the surrounding regions at Li sites in Fig. 15(b), indicating the formation of metallic bonds among Li and Mo atoms. In the case of the formation of the second and third full Li atomic layers, as shown in Fig. 15(c) and (d), respectively, the increase in electron density is mainly seen in the inter-layer region. Notably, the accumulated charge density in the interstitial region between two adsorbate layers is also highly delocalized.
 Fig. 15  3D-contour plots of the charge density difference at different stages in a multi-layer adsorption process for boridenes. For the bare Mo4/3B2 monolayer: (a) single Li+ adsorption stage (0.0015 e Å−3); (b) first full stable layer (0.0030 e Å−3); (c) second full stable layer (0.0026 e Å−3); and (d) third full stable layer (0.0010 e Å−3). For Mo4/3B2O2 monolayer: (e) single K+ ion adsorption stage (0.0010 e Å−3); (f) first full stable layer (0.0012 e Å−3); (g) second full stable layer (0.0010 e Å−3); and (h) third full stable layer (0.002 e Å−3). Yellow color refers to charge accumulation and the depletion is implied by blue contours. 
With the presence of O-terminations in the Mo4/3B2O2 monolayer, the adsorption of a single K+ causes electron density accumulation to occur at the neighboring O atoms, as shown in Fig. 15(e). In contrast to Fig. 15(b) for Mo4/3B2, the formation of a full stable K+ layer on Mo4/3B2O2 continues to increase the electron density at the O-terminations (see Fig. 15(f)). In the case of the second and third full stable adsorption layers (see Fig. 15(g) and (h)), the electron density is mainly depleted in the intra-layer region among the K atoms, which increases in the inter-layer region between the two adsorbate layers. Similar to that of Li-Mo4/3B2, the charge density is also delocalized in the inter-layer region.
The previous theoretical calculations on the formation of multi-layer adsorption structures for MXenes with alkaline (earth) metal ions suggest that the highly delocalized negative electron cloud (NEC) surrounding the adsorbates plays a vital role in reducing the strong Coulomb repulsive interactions among the metal ions, which also stabilizes the multi-layer adsorption structure. To further visualize whether this negative electron density also exists in the Mo4/3B2-M or Mo4/3B2O2-M system, the electron localization function (ELF) is illustrated for Mo4/3B2-Li and Mo4/3B2O-K structures in Fig. 16, respectively. In the case of bare Mo4/3B2, the ELF values among the Li and Mo atoms in the first full adsorption layer are around 0.5, as shown in Fig. 16(a), confirming the uniform electron gas-like charge density distribution. As can be seen in Fig. 16(b), after the formation of a second full adsorption Li atomic layer above the first layer, the ELF values in the inter-layer and intra-layer regions still resemble that of uniform electron gas (ELF = 0.5). However, once the third Li atomic layer is fully formed on the top of the first two adsorption layers, as shown in Fig. 16(c), the ELF values suddenly increases above 0.8. The large ELF values indicate the creation of highly localized electronic states, and the resulting electron density distribution no longer resembles that of uniform free electron gas. Similar results are also seen in Mg-Mo4/3B2 and Ca-Mo4/3B2 structures. Besides, we show the ELF contour plots for the K-Mo4/3B2O2 system in Fig. 16(d) and Fig. 14(e) and (f) for the first, second and third full adsorption layers of K ions on top of each other, respectively. In the case of the first full adsorption layer of K atoms on Mo4/3B2O2, the ELF values are close to zero in the interstitial regions between two similar or different atoms (see Fig. 16(d)). When the second stable full layer of K atoms is established on the top of the first layer, as can be seen in Fig. 16(e), the ELF values are found again to be very small in both the intra-layer and inter-layer regions. It is worth noting that the ionic bonds are usually characterized by ELF∼0 because there is almost no charge density overlapping in the interstitial regions between the cations and anions. Therefore, the first and second full layers of K atoms are bound to the Mo4/3B2O2 monolayer mainly through electrostatic interactions similar to that of an ionic bond. Fig. 16(f) displays the ELF for all 3 stable K layers on the upper surface of the Mo4/3B2O2 monolayer. We found that both the intra- and inter-layer regions show ELF values of around 0.5, implying the formation of metallic bonds among the K atoms in the third adsorption layer. Similar results were also illustrated for other adsorbates in Fig. S15–S18 in the ESI,† respectively. The presence of metallic bonds was further verified by the calculated electron densities of states for the adsorbate-saturated bare and O-terminated boridenes, as shown in Fig. S19.†
 Fig. 16  2-D contour plots of the electron localization function (ELF) for bare Mo4/3B2 and Mo4/3B2O2 with multi-layer adsorption structures: (a) first full stable Li+ on Mo4/3B2; (b) first two stable full layers of Li+ on Mo4/3B2; (c) all three full stable layers of Li+ on Mo4/3B2; (d) first full stable K+ on Mo4/3B2O2; (e) first two stable full layers of K+ on Mo4/3B2O2; and (f) all three full stable layers of K+ on Mo4/3B2O2. 
Here, the main findings from the analysis of the electron density difference and ELF are summarized. For the bare Mo4/3B2 monolayer, a negative electron cloud (NEC) similar to that of MXenes is indeed formed between the adsorbate layer and boridene, and also among the adsorbate layers. In the case of Mo4/3B2O2, the first 2 stable layers of alkaline (earth) metal atoms are directly bound to the boridene substrate simply by forming strong ionic bonds with O-terminations. The additional layer on the top of the first 2 full stable layers adheres to the substrate by the formation of a negative electron cloud (NEC). The NEC can effectively screen the repulsive Coulomb interactions among the adsorbate ions, acting as the glue to stabilize the multi-layer adsorption structure. However, the NEC may also eventually suppress the charge transfer between the adsorbates and substrate, weakening the metal ion adsorption capability of the boridene monolayer. Fig. 17(a) displays the calculated mean adsorption energy for each full stable layer for both Mo4/3B2 and Mo4/3B2O2. The results clearly indicate that the mean adsorption energy is the most negative for the first full stable layer, which changes to a less negative value for the other additional adsorption layers. Certainly, the outmost full layer has the least negative mean adsorption energy. Otherwise, we also noticed that the mean adsorption energy of Mo4/3B2O2 is usually more negative than that of Mo4/3B2 for the same stable full layer.

(b) Atomic Bader charges for adsorbates in different stable adsorption layers. 
Finally, we would like to highlight that the multi-layer adsorption mechanism is different to that of the metal plating process. In the case of the multi-layer adsorption structure, even the outmost adsorbates transfer the charges to the bottom substrate, which are still considered ions. Meanwhile, the metallic bonds dominate the inter-atomic interactions in the metal plating process, and the atoms are not considered as ions. To clarify the mechanism, the mean atomic Bader charges are shown in Fig. 17(b) for each stable full layer of alkaline (earth) metal adsorbates in the cases of Mo4/3B2 and Mo4/3B2O2. Obviously, the calculated Bader charges decrease from the innermost full layer to the outermost full layer, confirming that the alkaline (earth) metal ions are stored by the boridene monolayer.
4. Conclusions
Herein, we performed a detailed and comprehensive first-principles investigation on the crystal structures, surface decomposition reactions and electrochemical energy storage properties of boridenes. The surface functionalization of boridenes was found to be dominated by OH- and F-groups, where the O-terminations are the least stable. Among the bare Mo4/3B2 and surface terminated structures (Mo4/3B2T2 (T = O, OH and F)), the bare and O-terminated boridenes can accommodate alkaline (earth) metal ions by forming stable full adsorption layers. Surface decomposition or conversion reaction was observed between the Mo4/3B2(OH)2 and Mo4/3B2F2 monolayers and the adsorbates (Li+, Na+, K+, Mg2+ and Ca2+) in the first-principles molecular dynamics simulations, which was further analyzed in terms of the reaction thermodynamics for the relevant conversion reaction pathways. In the case of Mo4/3B2F2, the surface conversion reaction mainly produces alkaline (earth) metal fluorites and bare Mo4/3B2. Meanwhile, either metal hydroxides or metal oxides can be formed from the conversion reaction of Mo4/3B2(OH)2 with the adsorbates. In the cases of both bare Mo4/3B2 and Mo4/3B2O2, alkaline (earth) metal ions can form stable multi-layer adsorption structures. The presence of the multi-layer adsorption mechanism enables the boridenes to achieve high theoretical capacities for alkaline (earth) metal ion batteries especially lithium-, magnesium- and calcium-ion batteries. Nevertheless, the heavy molar mass of both boridenes and alkaline (earth) metal ions (Na+, K+, Mg2+ and Ca2+) sets a fundamental limitation for all the investigated boridene-M (M = alkaline (earth) metals) systems to provide higher gravimetric capacities. Regarding the open circuit voltage of the half-cell reaction, the bare Mo4/3B2 is superior, given that it shows smaller on-set charging voltages for alkaline (earth) metal ions than that of Mo4/3B2O2. Due to the presence of stable multi-layers for alkaline (earth) metal ions on boridenes, high ion mobilities are predicted for the adsorbates in the outer adsorption layers, leading to higher charge–discharge rate capacities for use as anodes in various alkaline (earth) metal-ion batteries or supercapacitors. The underlying physics for the formation of multi-layer adsorption structures with alkaline (earth) metal ions on bare boridenes was revealed to be similar to that of MXenes, where the negative electron cloud (NEC) glues multiple adsorbate layers together on the 2D materials. Besides, the formation of strong ionic bonds between the adsorbates and Mo4/3B2O2 monolayer is decisive for stabilizing the multi-layer adsorption structures. Overall, our results provide new physical insights into the electrochemical properties of boridenes for storing alkaline (earth) metal ions at the atomic scale, which can be helpful to guide future experimental studies on relevant topics.
