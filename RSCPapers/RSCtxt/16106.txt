    , Accepted 29th September 2017First published on 2nd October 2017AbstractThe hierarchical architecture of pristine and cadmium (Cd) and vanadium (V) doped copper indium disulphide (CuInS2 (CIS)) microsphere thin films grown on spray coated seed layers by a wet chemical method is demonstrated. First, nano-flakes of self-assembled porous (NFSAP)-CIS microspheres have been optimized on a CIS seed layer by controlling the synthesis strategy. Later, Cd and V were incorporated as foreign impurity ions into the NFSAP-CIS microspheres. The pristine and doped CIS microsphere films resulted in a body-centered-tetragonal crystal structure which was confirmed from the XRD and SAED patterns. The electron microscope images clearly depict the formation of a solid and an elongated NFSAP-CIS microsphere under Cd and V doping, respectively. The change in morphological structure was attributed to the suppression and expansion of the laterally oriented crystallographic plane. The chemical composition and optical and electrical properties of the pristine and Cd and V doped CIS films were determined by UV-vis, photoluminescence, XPS, and Hall measurements. The Cd and V doped CIS microsphere films have superior photoelectric response compared to the pristine CIS films. The controlled laterally oriented crystallographic plane in CIS microspheres brought about by doping induces the modification in the surface morphological structure that results in improved electrical and photo-physical properties. The results of this study provide a framework for fabricating an optimized CIS absorber layer in photovoltaic devices.
1. Introduction
Advanced material systems have recently been considered by the scientific community for harvesting energy from renewable and clean energy sources owing to challenges in the use of fossil fuels and the predicted increase in global energy consumption to approximately 7.8 × 1020 J in 2035. In this regard, research is currently underway to produce photovoltaic materials with superior crystalline quality, and this could provide one of the solutions to harvest solar energy to overcome the challenges for meeting the increasing energy demand. CuInS2 (CIS) has been used as an absorber layer in solid state solar cells for a couple of decades because of its excellent optical, electrical and non-toxic characteristics with good thermal and environmental stability.1–4 The theoretical efficiency of CIS-based solar cells is 28%, but the experimentally achieved maximum efficiency so far is only 12.5%.5,6 This large difference is typically attributed to the presence of intrinsic atomic level defects in the material during synthesis. These defects enhance the recombination process resulting in sluggish charge carrier kinetics. The defect-associated problems can be solved by depositing highly crystalline films or improving their physico-chemical properties by optimizing the synthesis parameters and incorporating foreign impurity ions.
Different deposition techniques have been successfully used for the deposition of CIS films including solution based growth, chemical vapour deposition, sputtering and chemical spray pyrolysis techniques.7–10 Additionally, several impurity ions have been introduced into CIS lattice sites to improve their structural, optical and electrical properties. Akaki et al.11 investigated highly-oriented CIS films by Bi doping, which decreased the electrical resistivity value of the film to 0.5 Ω cm−1. Another study reported that the doping of Na into CIS films significantly reduced their electrical resistivity from 8 to 1 Ω cm−1.12 A maximum absorption coefficient of 1.5 × 105 cm−1 was obtained by Zribi et al. for a 0.5% Na doped CIS film.13 Absorption coefficients on the order of 9.55 to 12.31 × 105 cm−1 have been successfully achieved in Al doped CIS films.14 It is observed that Cd acts as a suitable donor dopant to convert from a p to an n-type semiconductor.15 Further, V doping into CIS films influenced their structural, optical, electrical, and morphological properties due to the capability of V to enter into CIS matrices with variable oxidation states.16 These reports clearly reiterate that possibilities exist for depositing high-quality CIS films with the addition of dopants. Moreover, the size, shape, and dimensionality of the semiconductors are also important characteristics for obtaining superior physico-chemical properties.
Thin film deposition with the desired morphological structures and controlled crystallographic plane growth is still a matter of intense research work towards developing technology based materials. Seed layers usually result in favorable nucleation sites and promote special growth directions during film deposition. Therefore, a seed layer is commonly used for growing nanorods (NRs), nanowires (NWs), nanotubes (NTs) and nanoflowers (NFs) of various metal oxide semiconducting materials in their fast growth in the c-axis crystallographic plane.17–21 Oriented attachment of a crystallographic plane plays a vital role in the growth of microspheres on the seeded substrate. Hierarchical CIS microspheres consist of primary nanoscale building units, which is a very powerful morphological structure that significantly provides a higher specific surface area and multiple light scattering effects for efficient light absorption. In recent years, microspheres of CIS and CZTS have frequently been synthesized as colloidal crystals, powders, and core/shell nanocable arrays.22–26
The change in the microspheres' morphological structure brought about by the doping process in CIS thin films has not yet been observed and discussed to the best of our knowledge. The growth of metal chalcogenide CIS microspheres on CIS seeded glass substrates is reported herewith for the first time. The growth of solid and nano-flakes of self-assembled porous (NFSAP) hierarchical architecture microspheres has been observed by changing the synthesis strategy and solution chemistry. Initially, we have optimized the synthesis conditions to obtain good crystalline nanostructured CuInS2 thin films. A discussion about the surface and number density of the microsphere morphology is provided. The number density was tuned to control the surface morphology of the CIS microspheres by Cd and V doping which assisted their controlled laterally aligned crystallographic plane growth. Eventually, the current voltage characteristics of the pristine and doped CIS microsphere films were measured in the dark and under light conditions.
2. Experimental details
2.1 CIS seed layer preparation
A CIS seed layer of 80 ± 10 nm thickness was deposited on a glass substrate (2.5 × 2.5 × 0.15 cm3) by the chemical spray pyrolysis technique. CuCl2, InCl3, and CH4N2S were used as the precursors for Cu, In and S, respectively. To obtain (Cu/In = 1) and (Cu + In)/S unit molar ratios, a 0.05 M solution of each precursor was prepared separately and mixed together. Further, CuCl2 and CH4N2S were mixed together and then aqueous InCl3 was gently added. Prior to the deposition of the precursor mixture, the substrate was cleaned by standard chemical procedures. The substrate was then kept on a hotplate at 250 °C. The nozzle to substrate distance was carefully maintained at 24 cm. 25 ml of the resultant solution was sprayed onto the preheated glass substrate at a spray rate of 2 ml min−1. Compressed air was used as a carrier gas. The deposited film was then annealed at 450 °C for 1 h in a muffle furnace.
2.2 NFSAP-CIS microsphere preparation
Pristine and Cd and V doped NFSAP-CIS thin films of thickness in the range of 6.02 to 6.17 μm (Table S1 and Fig. S1†) were deposited by a hydrothermal method with a precursor solution consisting of 0.1 M of CuCl2, InCl3, CH4N2S, CdCl2, and VCl3. Different weight percentages (5, 10, and 15 wt%) of VCl3 and CdCl2 were used for Cd and V doping, respectively. To develop the film, a mixture of double distilled water and ethylene glycol (90:10% V/V) was used as a solvent and a stabilizing agent, respectively. The resultant solution was stirred for 45 minutes and then transferred into a stainless steel (25 ml capacity) autoclave. The prepared CIS seed layer film was immersed into the solution and inclined at an angle of 45° to the wall of Teflon. The hydrothermal process was carried out at a temperature of 140 °C for 8 h. Subsequently, the film was sulphurized at 350 °C for 1 h.
2.3 Characterization
The deposited films were carefully subjected to various characterization techniques to identify their fundamental physico-chemical properties. The crystalline phases were identified by X-ray diffraction (XRD; Bruker D8 Advanced X-ray diffractometer) in the 2θ range of 20° to 80° using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis (XPS; Shimadzu ESCA 3400) was used for investigating their elemental composition and oxidation states. The surface morphology of the film was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (FESEM; Nova NanoSEM 230). The micro/nano scale range size of the particles in deposited films was then studied by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM; JEOL JEM 2100) operated at 200 kV. The optical properties of the materials were analyzed by using UV-vis (Shimadzu-UV 2450 double beam spectrophotometer, wavelength range 200 to 1000 nm) and photoluminescence spectroscopic analyses at room temperature. The electrical properties were studied using a Hall measurement set-up in the Van der Pauw configuration (Ecopia HMS-3000). A wettability test was performed using a contact angle analyzer (Holmarc Inc). The photoconductivity measurements were carried out in a vacuum chamber using a Hind high vacuum cryostat facility instrument (Tektronix, model# 6487) at room temperature.
3. Results and discussion
The solid Cd doped CIS, NFSAP pristine and V doped CIS microspheres were examined by XRD analysis to identify their crystal structure and growth orientation. The recorded XRD patterns are shown in Fig. 1(a and b). The detected (112), (004), (204) and (312) crystallographic domain diffraction peaks at 2θ values ∼27.8°, 32.3°, 46.4° and 54.8°, respectively, are consistent with JCPDS no. 32-0339 which belongs to the body-centered tetragonal CIS crystal structure. The formation of secondary phases like CdS, CdO, V2O3, VO2, or V2O5, Cu2S and In2S3 is possible in V and Cd doped CIS films with respect to the chemical deposition method. Hence, we carefully studied the XRD patterns, and no additional peaks were observed other than the body-centered tetragonal crystal structure which reveals that the optimized experimental condition is ideal for achieving the desired crystallographic structure. All the diffraction peaks are marginally shifted to lower and higher 2θ angles with respect to Cd and V doping, respectively, indicating that the dopants are entering into all crystalline domains during the synthesis process.27 Fig. S2(a and b)† show the magnified lower and higher angle shift of the 112 plane with respect to Cd and V doping, and the lattice spacing variation of the preferentially oriented crystallographic (112) plane is shown in Fig. S2(c).†

The lattice parameters were constant for the pristine CIS (a = 5.517(1) Å, c = 11.006(2) Å), increased for the 15 wt% Cd doped CIS film (a = 5.664(1) Å, c = 11.075(2) Å) and decreased for the 15 wt% V doped CIS film (a = 5.452(1) Å, c = 10.875(2) Å). The larger ionic radius of Cd2+ ions (0.97 Å) compared to Cu+ ions (0.77 Å) in the tetragonal coordination sites predisposes the unit cell of CIS to expand.27,28 The ionic radius of V3+ ions (0.64 Å) is smaller compared to Cu+ ions (0.77 Å) in the tetragonal coordination sites, hence the lattice shrinks with doping of V3+.16 The crystallite size and dislocation density of the preferentially oriented crystallographic plane (Table 1) were estimated using the Debye–Scherrer and Williamson and Smallman's equations, respectively.29 The change in structural parameters reveals that the V and Cd doping ions are robustly involved in the CIS crystal structure formation. Crystallite size reduction in CIS with increasing Zn doping concentration was also observed by E. Garskaite et al.30

The change in structural parameters brought about by Cd and V doping in CIS is due to replacement of the Cu ion in the crystal lattice by the larger Cd ion and the smaller V ion, respectively. The intensity of a specific diffraction peak presumably explains the growth direction as well as the number/size of crystallographic domains. From previous and present work, we elucidate that the (204) diffraction peak corresponds to the lateral direction of the crystallographic plane to the surface of the microspheres, which is also confirmed by HRTEM images.31 The change in the intensity of the (204) diffraction peak reveals that the lateral growth direction to the surface of the microspheres is controlled by Cd and V doping.

Fig. 2(a) shows the overall XPS spectrum of the pristine CIS film. Cu, In, and S are the key components in the obtained spectrum. As shown in Fig. 2(b) for the high-resolution Cu XPS spectrum, two satellite peaks are observed at 931.5 and 951.5 eV, which are attributed to the binding energy (BE) of Cu 2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2, respectively. This strongly agrees with the BE of Cu+.32Fig. 2(c) shows the two satellite peaks at 451.8 and 445.6 eV belonging to the In 3d5/2 and In 3d3/5 orbital states. This confirms that In is not oxidized during film deposition as seen in previous work.33,34 The peak at 167.6 eV in Fig. 2(d) corresponds to the binding energy of the S 2p state. No further fitted peaks were found, which may be due to the sole S chemical environment of the single CIS phase.

(e) Survey spectrum of Cd doped CIS thin films, (f) high-resolution Cd 3d spectrum, (g) survey spectrum of V doped CIS thin films, and (h) high-resolution V 2p spectrum. 
The full range XPS spectra of Cd and V doped CIS are shown in Fig. 2(e) and (g), respectively. Besides the components present in the pristine CIS film, Cd and V peaks are also present in the XPS spectra of doped CIS. The high resolution XPS spectrum of Cd doped CIS (Fig. 2(f)) illustrates the presence of two satellite peaks at 405.8 and 412.2 eV, corresponding to the Cd 3d orbital and also associated with the Cd 3d5/2 and Cd 3d3/2 orbital states. From this, it is confirmed that the Cd2+ ions are involved in forming the CIS crystallite.35 Furthermore, the high resolution XPS spectrum of V doped CIS (Fig. 2(h)) shows two peaks at 512.10 and 519.7 eV, aroused by V 2p state satellites. The first peak corresponds to the binding energy of the V2p3/2 state and the other peak is associated with the V 2p1/2 state.36 Hence, it authentically confirms that the V2O3 and V2O5 secondary phases are not formed in V doped CIS films. Also, no other secondary phases (In2S3, CdS, and Cu2S) are detected in Cd and V doped CIS films by either XRD or XPS.
In recent years, microspheres of CIS have been mostly synthesized as colloidal crystals and powders.37–39 Our research group, however, planned to deposit CIS microspheres as a film. Initial attempts were focused on depositing a CIS microsphere film on a bare glass substrate through wet chemical methods. A thick layer film was deposited with respect to varying the synthetic conditions, but this thick layer film easily peels off from the substrate. The SEM image (Fig. S3†) for this peel off film shows a separate flake-like morphological structure on the micro scale. Therefore, we prepared a thin CIS layer on a glass substrate by using the chemical spray pyrolysis technique and then used this as a seed layer for reducing the interfacial barrier between the substrate and the depositing film. The deposition of CIS microspheres on the seeded glass substrate was optimized by changing the deposition time of the wet chemical method, as shown in Fig. S4.† After that, ethylene glycol was used as a stabilizing agent for controlling the growth rate of the depositing film.40 Finally, the NFSAP morphological structure was optimized by controlling the synthetic conditions.
The distribution of microspheres over the seed layer shows that the seed layer played an important role in the formation of morphological structure of the microspheres. The majority of NFSAP microspheres in the pristine CIS film have a diameter of ∼2.5 μm (Fig. 3a and b). From the high magnification SEM image, it can be observed that the microsphere is composed of a number of cross linked nano-flakes. This structure successfully gives porous surface characteristics.41 Hence, the formation of crystallite attachments is one of the important factors for growing microspheres on a film at longer deposition times. Fig. 4 shows the schematic representation of the formation mechanism of the NFSAP CIS microsphere thin film. Fundamental physical and chemical characteristics such as Ostwald ripening, van der Waals force and dipole field are involved in the self-assembly of CIS crystallites, which leads to crystallographic plane attachment that results in the microspheres' morphological structure.42–44 Nanoflakes form first and then self-assemble into microspheres by aggregation and Oswald ripening.45–47 When V ions are introduced into the CIS precursor, the V ions interact with the host ions with respect to applying external energy that changes the growth rate of the depositing film. Under this condition, the length of the nano-flakes increases in V doped CIS microspheres, and consequently, bigger microspheres are formed. As shown in Fig. 5(a–c), the observed nano-flake length is approximately 2.32, 2.61 and 3.42 μm for 5, 10 and 15 wt% V doped CIS microsphere films, respectively. In contrast, the size of the Cd-doped CIS microsphere is lower than that of the pristine CIS microsphere. Additionally, the nano-flake surface is not formed in most of the microspheres when Cd is introduced (Fig. 5d–f). A smooth solid sphere surface is formed with an increase in the Cd doping level. This may be due to the suppression of laterally oriented crystallographic plane growth by the decreasing growth rate under competition between the host and dopant during the synthesis process. For this reason, the number of microspheres increased in relation to reducing their dimensions. A number density of ∼3.14 × 104 cm−2, ∼4.7 × 104 cm−2, ∼3.8 × 104 cm−2, and ∼6.9 × 104 cm−2 is observed for the pristine, 5 wt%, 10 wt%, and 15 wt% Cd doped CIS film, respectively. The change in the growth rate and lattice spacing values of the deposited film under Cd and V doping displays the higher surface to volume ratio of the microsphere morphological structure.

The growth direction, lattice dimension and crystalline nature of the solid Cd doped CIS, NFSAP pristine and V doped CIS microspheres were then strongly confirmed by means of TEM, HRTEM and SAED patterns, respectively (Fig. 6a–i). It can be seen that the surface of the pristine CIS microspheres revealed the nano-flakes. The lattice fringe of the pristine CIS film has an inter-planar spacing of ∼0.315 nm, which is associated with the (112) lattice plane.30,41,42 The concentric circular diffraction pattern indicates the polycrystalline nature of the pristine CIS film exhibiting the body-centered tetragonal structure (JCPDS – 32-0339). Interestingly, it was noticed that the length of the nano-flakes increased in the 15 wt% V doped CIS microsphere film and is about ∼2.5 μm. The lattice fringes were again taken from the nano-flake surface for this film. The observed 0.19 nm d-spacing value corresponds to the (204) crystallographic plane of a CIS semiconductor. This result evidently indicates that the plane grew normal to the surface of the microsphere. The solid microsphere formation at 15 wt% Cd doped CIS is authentically confirmed from Fig. 6(c). The observed inter-planar spacing from lattice fringes is ∼0.32 nm corresponding to the (112) crystallographic plane. The SAED patterns of both V and Cd doped CIS films exhibit the body-centered tetragonal crystal structure along with the polycrystalline nature. The expansion and shrinkage of the lateral plane of the surface to the microsphere are authentically confirmed by TEM and HRTEM images, respectively. With the optimized synthesis conditions, we obtained highly crystalline nanostructured CuInS2 thin films, confirmed by the XRD, HRTEM, and SAED patterns of the films.

Optical characterization methods like UV-vis and fluorescence spectroscopy strongly explain the photo-physical properties of semiconductors. The optical absorption spectra (Fig. 7(a)) were initially recorded for pristine and V and Cd doped CIS films at room temperature in the wavelength range of 220 to 1000 nm. All the films exhibited absorption at around ∼850 nm. The observed absorbance value for 15 wt% Cd and V doped CIS microsphere films is higher than that for the pristine CIS microsphere film. This is because the doped CIS films are consuming more charge carriers according to the higher surface to volume ratio via increasing the length of the nano-flakes and the number of the microspheres. Further, we realized that tuning the morphological structure of the absorber layer significantly enhances the absorbance capacity. A marginal red shift is observed in V and Cd doped CIS microspheres. The alteration of the interatomic distance in the CIS by introducing a dopant stimulates the intrinsic and surface defect states with respect to changes in morphological structure and is the main reason for this red shift.43 According to the multiple light scattering effect between each of the nano-flakes, the 15 wt% V doped CIS microsphere exhibits a higher absorbance than the 15 wt% Cd doped CIS solid microsphere film. The calculated optical band gap (Eg) values using Tauc's plots are shown in Fig. 7(b) and the estimated values are presented in Table 1. The decrease in Eg of CIS semiconductors via Cd and V doping is due to overlapping of the Cu 4s orbital of CIS with the 5s and 4s orbitals of Cd15,27 and V,16 respectively. The alteration in the length and strength of the chemical bonds by introducing a dopant leads to a change in the surface morphological structure with a higher specific surface area resulting in enhancement of the valence orbital electronic structure.

The photoluminescence (PL) spectra of pristine and Cd and V doped CIS microsphere thin films were also recorded (Fig. S5a and b†). The PL emission peak intensity gradually diminishes with increasing Cd and V doping concentration. This demonstrates that the dopant ion efficiently decreases the recombination rate. Therefore, the decreasing PL peak intensity of the CIS films under doping is favourable for the lifetime of the photo charge carriers. The maximum quenching effect is observed for the 15 wt% V doped CIS film and not the pristine or Cd doped CIS films. This result reveals that the laterally and lengthy nano-flake assembled CIS microsphere morphological structure could be suitable for attaining superb photo-physical properties.
The change in the electrical properties (resistivity (ρ), mobility (μ) and carrier concentration (N)) of the CIS microspheres caused by Cd and V doping is depicted in Fig. 8(a and b) and the obtained values are summarized in Table 1. The positive sign of the Hall coefficient in the pristine CIS microsphere film confirms the p-type conductivity and this result is explained in previously published work.35,48 The main reason is that the deficiency of metallic ions increases the positive charge carriers with respect to deposition methods that leads to the positioning of the Fermi level near the valence band. When 5 and 10 wt% Cd and V doping ions are introduced into CIS microspheres, the Hall coefficient sign changed from positive to negative which represents that the conduction type changed from p to n.49 Subsequently, the n-type characteristic remains by increasing the doping concentration. Generally, the incorporation of V and Cd ions into CIS sites could occur in three different ways: (i) solely occupying the In site to create a donor, (ii) occupying the S site to create an acceptor, and (iii) occupying the interstitial site to create a donor, and the donor DCu and DIn compensated for the acceptor DS.50 Here, V and Cd occupy the Cu site to create a donor, therefore the origin of n-type conductivity is observed by doping and then persist with respect to doping percentage. The resistivity value rapidly decreased by an order of magnitude while the carrier concentration increased due to V doping, as shown in Fig. 8(b). The rapid decrease in resistivity at 15 wt% V doped CIS may be attributed to the availability of a large number of charge carriers. The mobility of the majority of charge carriers increased for 15 wt% V doping, and this is attributed to a decrease in impurity scattering due to V ions. In 2016, our research team reported the electrical conductivity of 27.16 S cm−1 for V doped CIS nanorods, which was deposited by the chemical spray pyrolysis technique.16 After that, now, one of the highest electrical conductivity 62.05 S cm−1 is achieved on NFSAP CIS semiconductor microsphere films with respect to V doping. Hence, it is concluded that V is a suitable donor dopant, which successfully gives the low resistance n-type CIS layer film.

The water repellent properties have attracted special attention from academia and industry owing to their promising applications in self-cleaning and oil–water separation applications. Surface wettability is a key characteristic for absorber layer materials that could help to determine the durability of fabricating devices. The apparent contact angle (CA) is explained by the Cassie–Baxter model,51 in which the liquids are assumed to come into contact with the solid surface through the top of the asperities, and the air pockets are supposed to be trapped underneath the liquid. It is well-known that the air trapped in the surface is very essential to the hydrophobicity because the water CA of air is considered to be 180°. The Cassie–Baxter equation is given belowcosθCB = f1cosθ0 − f2where θCB is the CB contact angle, θ0 is the CA on a flat surface, and f1 and f2 are the fractions of the solid surface and air in contact with the liquid, respectively. It is noted that f1 + f2 = 1, and it could be concluded that a larger f2 (more air pockets) will result in a larger θCB.
In the present work, the NFSAP V doped CIS microsphere might significantly give a higher surface hydrophobicity. The pristine CIS microsphere film exhibited a CA of 94.2° (Fig. 9a and d); however, a lower CA of 77.4° was observed for the 15 wt% Cd doped CIS solid microspheres (Fig. 9b). A CA of 138° was obtained on the 15 wt% elongated NFASP V doped CIS microsphere (Fig. 9c). The results show that the surface becomes more hydrophobic with V doping but becomes hydrophilic with Cd doping. The smooth surface of the 15 wt% Cd doped CIS solid morphological structure (Fig. 9e) leads to a lower CA value. The shallow pores of the elongated NFSAP morphological structure (Fig. 9f) are capable of capturing more air in between each flake that could be trapped in the surface pores, leading to a higher CA value for 15 wt% V doped CIS films.

The photo-response of the pristine and Cd and V doped CIS microsphere films was investigated in the dark and under illumination conditions (Fig. 10 and S6†). The electrical contacts of the deposited films were made using copper clips fixed onto the thin film with 0.5 cm spacing using silver paste and then connected in series with a DC power supply and a KEITHLEY 485 Pico ammeter (Fig. 10a). Then, the films were illuminated with a full spectrum of a xenon lamp (50 W). The DC input was increased from −5 to +5 volts in steps and subsequent dark currents and photocurrents were measured using an electrometer. The observed linear I–V curve of the films reveals the Ohmic nature of the contact.52 Compared with the pristine CIS microsphere (Fig. 10b), higher photo response is observed in V and Cd doped CIS microspheres (Fig. 10c and d). This result is caused by the doped CIS films exciting a higher number of photoelectrons under illumination. It shows that the higher absorbance and good electrical properties specifically the carrier concentration of the films stimulate the good photo-response. Finally, the higher photo response observed in the 15 wt% elongated NFASP V doped CIS microsphere (Fig. 10d) reveals that our result is consistent with the scientific phenomena and reported work.53 The elongated NFASP V doped CIS microsphere absorber is a useful candidate for producing higher photocurrents in solar energy conversion devices.

4. Conclusion
The use of NFSAP-CIS microsphere morphologies in a thin film on spray CIS seeded glass substrates produced by a hydrothermal method was successfully demonstrated. Transition metal ions such as Cd and V ions were introduced into the CIS microspheres using an in situ process. Interestingly, a change in the number density, as well as surface structures of the microspheres, was observed without changing the crystal structure by Cd and V doping. The presence of V and Cd doping ions in the CIS microsphere is confirmed by XPS analysis. Improved optical characteristics such as a wide absorption range, higher absorbance, and a higher quenching effect were achieved for V and Cd doped CIS microspheres. Higher mobility and carrier concentrations with low resistivity were attained for 15 wt% Cd and V doped CIS microspheres, respectively. The hydrophilic and hydrophobic nature observed for 15 wt% Cd and V doped CIS films was confirmed via contact angle measurement. The changing number of the crystallite domains and controlled laterally aligned growth direction are the key factors for achieving the desirable structural, optical and electrical properties in 15 wt% V and Cd doped CIS microsphere thin films. This report provides a pathway for fabricating photovoltaic devices using non-toxic semiconductor materials.
