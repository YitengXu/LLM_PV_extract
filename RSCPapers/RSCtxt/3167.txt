    , Accepted 12th April 2016First published on 13th April 2016AbstractConjugated polymers with LUMO levels of −4.00 eV and a perylene bisimide derivative with a LUMO level of −4.56 eV were used in non-fullerene solar cells in which power conversion efficiencies up to 1.4% were achieved.
Non-fullerene solar cells that use conjugated materials as electron acceptors to replace fullerene derivatives have attracted much attention in recent years,1–5 resulting in high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) >9%.6–8 This achievement is partially attributed to the vast material diversity of conjugated molecules, which can be built from many electron-deficient building blocks, such as benzothiadiazole (BT),9 cyanoacetate,7,8,10 naphthalene diimide,11 perylene bisimide (PBI)12–15 and diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP).16,17 Because of this, the absorption spectra, energy levels and charge transport properties of electron acceptors can be optimized to achieve high performance solar cells. For instance, most electron acceptors were designed to have high-lying lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels compared to the fullerene derivatives, such as [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM), which could help to reduce the LUMO offset between the electron donor and acceptor and meanwhile enhance the open circuit voltage (Voc) in solar cells.18,19 Interestingly, conjugated molecules with LUMO levels below that of PCBM are rarely reported as electron acceptors for application in solar cells.
Conjugated molecules with deep LUMO levels below −4.0 eV have been successfully applied in high performance field-effect transistors (FETs) with air-stable electron mobilities,20–23 indicating their potential application as electron acceptors. However, when using electron acceptors with very deep LUMO levels in bulk-heterojunction solar cells, high LUMO offsets between the donor and acceptor can easily be generated, which will enhance the energy loss24 and are detrimental for photovoltaic performance. In order to reduce the energy loss, conjugated polymers with LUMO levels close or equal to PCBM will be the candidates as electron donors. Although these polymers with low-lying LUMO levels have good air-stability, the LUMO offset between the polymers and PCBM is insufficient for exciton separation into free charges. Therefore, it will be interesting to study organic solar cells by incorporating electron donors and acceptors with deep LUMO levels.
In this work, a PBI derivative with a low lying LUMO level was designed and used as an electron acceptor for non-fullerene solar cells. The idea starts from a bis-PBI compound, SdiPBI, as shown in Fig. 1a, which has a similar LUMO level to PCBM and was applied in high performance solar cells.25 In order to further lower the LUMO level, two cyano groups were introduced. It has been widely reported that by introducing strong electron-withdrawing cyano units, conjugated molecules can get deep LUMO levels, which was beneficial for air-stable electron mobilities.20–22,26 The cyano substituted PBI compound, SdiCNPBI (Fig. 1a), is found to provide a LUMO level of −4.56 eV. The new molecule as an electron acceptor and two conjugated polymers based on DPP units24 (Fig. 1b) with LUMO levels of around −4.00 eV as electron donors were applied in solar cells. The photovoltaic results show that PCEs of up to 1.4% can be achieved, indicating the efficient charge transfer, which was further confirmed by highly quenching photoluminescence (PL) spectra. This is the first time that organic solar cells based on donors and acceptors with LUMO levels both below −4.0 eV are reported.

The synthetic procedure is presented in Scheme 1. The bay-linked perylene bisimide acceptor, SdiPBI,27 was selected as the starting material. Bis-PBI structures are able to prevent the aggregation of the PBI core, which is helpful for controlling the micro-phase separation in bulk-heterojunction systems.12,13 SdiPBI was converted into dibromo-derivative Br-SdiPBI with a yield of 93%, followed by cyanation with Zn(CN)2 to afford the final compound SdiCNPBI with a yield of 87%. For both the brominated and cyanated PBI materials, a mixture of isomers is present, as indicated by NMR spectroscopy (Fig. S1, ESI†).

Absorption spectra of SdiCNPBI in CHCl3 solution and thin films are shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†), and the data are summarized in Table 1. Molecule SdiCNPBI shows similar absorption spectra in solution and thin films, indicating that the twisted bis-PBI units prevent the aggregation in thin films. This material exhibits similar absorption spectra to SdiPBI, with an optical band gap (Eg) of 2.03 eV in thin films. The DPP polymers PDPP2TzT and PDPP2Tz2T investigated in this work have an Eg of 1.44 eV and 1.47 eV (Table 1). The complementary absorption between the donor and acceptor is helpful for harvesting sunlight.

The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and LUMO levels of SdiCNPBI were determined by cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements and referenced to a work function of ferrocene of −5.23 eV (Fig. S3, ESI†). The energy levels of the donors and acceptors are also summarized in Table 1. SdiCNPBI shows HOMO and LUMO levels of −6.59 eV and −4.56 eV, while SdiPBI without the two cyano groups has HOMO and LUMO levels of −6.35 eV and −4.28 eV. To compare, the LUMO level of PCBM was determined to be −4.16 eV (Fig. S3, ESI†). Since the LUMO levels of PDPP2TzT and PDPP2Tz2T are −4.07 eV and −3.95 eV, the LUMO offset between the polymers and SdiPBI is close to or below 0.3 eV, while the LUMO offset of the DPP polymers to SdiCNPBI is increased to 0.49 eV and 0.61 eV. The increased LUMO offset will enhance the driving force for exciton dissociation into free charges, which is beneficial for improving the device performance.
We also measured the hole and electron mobilities of the donor polymers PDPP2TzT and PDPP2Tz2T by FETs with a bottom gate–bottom contact configuration. The results are summarized in part 6, ESI.† These two polymers possess ambipolar charge mobilities, with a hole mobility of 0.14 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PDPP2TzT and 0.54 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PDPP2Tz2T (Table S1, ESI†). The results demonstrate that these two polymers can have good hole transport properties for application in organic solar cells.
The DPP polymers and PBI derivatives with deep energy levels were applied in solar cells using an inverted configuration, where ITO/ZnO and MoO3/Ag were used as electrodes. For the photo-active layers, the ratio of the donor to acceptor is 1:1. Other processing conditions, such as solvent, with or without an additive, and thickness, were carefully optimized to achieve the best performance (Tables S2 and S3, ESI†). The optimized performance of the solar cells is shown in Fig. 2 and the photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 2.

When using SdiPBI as an electron acceptor, PDPP2TzT or PDPP2Tz2T based cells provided PCEs below 0.10% due to very low short circuit current densities (Jsc) (Table 2). The performance of solar cells was dramatically improved by using SdiCNPBI as an acceptor. PDPP2TzT:SdiCNPBI cells showed the best PCE of 0.72%, with Jsc of 2.7 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.81 V and a fill factor (FF) of 0.33. PDPP2Tz2T:SdiCNPBI had a better PCE of 1.4% with high Jsc of 5.5 mA cm−2. The improved Jscs were also reflected by the external quantum spectra (EQE). Both cells with SdiCNPBI showed a broad photoresponse between 300 nm and 850 nm with a maximum EQE of 0.25 (Fig. 2b).
We further used PL measurements to study the charge transfer in these photo-active layers, as shown in Fig. 3. All the thin films were excited at 770 nm and the intensity was calibrated according to their absorption spectra (Fig. S5, ESI†). Both DPP polymers exhibit PL emission between 800 nm and 1100 nm with a peak at around 950 nm. When the polymers were blended with SdiPBI, similar or even higher PL intensities compared to those of the pure thin films were observed, indicating that there is no charge transfer from the polymer donors to SdiPBI. It is interesting to note that PDPP2TzT:SdiPBI thin films gave a higher PL signal, which may originate from less aggregation of PDPP2TzT in blended films. When using SdiCNPBI as an electron acceptor, the PL signal was strongly quenched, which illustrates that efficient charge transfer occurred in these systems. The PL quenching result is consistent with the photovoltaic performance.
 Fig. 3  Photoluminescence spectra of the DPP polymer:PBI derivative thin films. Both PDPP2TzT and its blend thin films were fabricated from CHCl3 with 5% o-DCB. Both PDPP2Tz2T and its blend thin films were fabricated from CHCl3 with 0.2% DIO. The PL intensity has been calibrated with absorption spectra of the thin films (Fig. S5, ESI†). The excitation wavelength is 770 nm. 
The DPP polymer:SdiCNPBI cells have reasonable PCEs, but are less efficient compared to other non-fullerene solar cells, which is mainly due to low Jsc and FF. We examined the morphology of the photo-active layers by atom force microscopy (AFM), which showed smooth surfaces with roughnesses of 0.89–1.80 nm (Fig. S6, ESI†). It has been reported that the phase separation in bulk-heterojunction systems can be reflected by the surface characterization from AFM images, in which the coarse surface with high roughness means the large phase separation.28 Therefore, in our study, the smooth surfaces may be indicative of a very fine phase separation between the donor and acceptor. In addition, DPP polymers have been reported to have high hole mobilities,29 while twisted PBI units showed low electron mobilities due to reduced crystallinity. The unbalanced hole and electron mobility could enhance the charge recombination during charge transport. Therefore, designing new PBI units with a twisted backbone but meanwhile maintaining high electron mobility could be a potential strategy to improve the PCE of these kinds of solar cells.
Conclusions
A PBI derivative with a deep LUMO level of −4.56 eV was designed and synthesized by introducing two cyano groups into a molecule. The molecule was applied as an electron acceptor in non-fullerene solar cells, where two conjugated polymers with LUMO levels around −4.00 eV were used as electron donors. A PCE of 1.4% was achieved, which was further explained by the efficient charge separation observed in PL experiments. This is the first study on the photovoltaic properties of conjugated donors and acceptors with both LUMO levels below −4.0 eV.
