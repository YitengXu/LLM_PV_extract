Phys., 2000, 2, 3335-3339Electron paramagnetic resonance and diffuse reflectance spectroscopic studies of the photoionization of N-alkylphenothiazines in synthetic microporous M-clinoptilolite (M=Na++K+, H+, Li+, Na+, K+, Ni2+, Co2+, Cu2+) molecular sieves at room temperatureR.

Ranjit and Larry Kevan*Department of Chemistry, Uniersity of Houston, Houston, TX 77204-5641, USAReceived 10th April 2000, Accepted 24th May 2000First published on UnassignedUnassigned29th June 2000AbstractMethylphenothiazine and other N-alkylphenothiazines were incorporated into M-clinoptilolite
 (M=Na++K+, H+, Li+, Na+, K+, Ni2+, Co2+, Cu2+) channels by impregnation. Photoionization of N-alkylphenothiazines (PCn) doped into dehydrated M-clinoptilolite samples at room temperature by ultraviolet irradiation results in the formation of N-alkylphenothiazine radical cations (PCn•+). The radicals were identified by the electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) g-factor and by diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. Dehydrated M-clinoptilolites are efficient hosts for the formation and stabilization of PCn+ at room temperature.
 As-synthesized M-clinoptilolite that was not dehydrated and then doped with PCn was EPR silent. The PCn+ yield was determined by double integration of the EPR spectrum. The PCn+ yield is highest in H-clinoptilolite among the other ion-exchanged M-clinoptilolites. The photoionization efficiency to form PCn+ decreases in the order H-clinoptilolite>Ni-clinoptilolite>K-clinoptilolite>Na-clinoptilolite>Co-clinoptilolite>Na,K-clinoptilolite>Li-clinoptilolite>Cu-clinoptilolite.
 The photooxidation yields decrease as the PCn alkyl chain length increases from methylphenothiazine (PC1) to decylphenothiazine (PC10). The photoionization efficiency depends on the nature of the metal ion and the channel
 size of the M-clinoptilolite material.IntroductionSubstantial effort is being directed toward the development of
 stable and efficient photosynthetic systems for the conversion
 and storage of solar energy into chemical energy.1–6 In these
 photochemical processes, chemical energy is stored in a charge
 separated state (D+A−). In artificial systems a major goal is to
 produce net charge separation, since efficient photoionization
 followed by rapid ion recombination is not a route to practical
 energy storage. In homogeneous solution back-electron
 transfer and recombination of the photoproducts is typically
 fast. These processes can be slowed down in heterogeneous
 systems where the molecular mobility is restricted and the
 electron donors and one or more electron acceptors are spatially
 organized. Several significant results have been obtained
 in studies of model heterogeneous systems of vesicles,7,8 micelles,9,10
 clays,11,12 layered materials,13–15 silica gels16,17 and
 zeolites18–20 containing photoactive molecules. The net
 photoyield of photoinduced charge separation has been
 increased and back-electron transfer has been slowed down
 significantly compared with homogeneous systems with
 similar photoactive molecules. Recent electron paramagnetic
 resonance (EPR) and diffuse reflectance studies of the photoionization
 and stabilization of photoproducts in
 microporous21,22 and mesoporous23 materials proved that
 efficient and long-lived charge separation can be achieved for
 hours or even several days at room temperature.Recently, we have reported the photoinduced charge
 separation of N-alkylphenothiazines in microporous Na,K-ETS-10
 and its ion-exchanged molecular sieves with different
 alkali metal ions, transition metal ions and protons.21 These
 microporous crystalline materials show very efficient photoinduced
 electron transfer of PCn and form a charge separated
 state which is long-lived and very stable in air for several days.
 Spectroscopic studies show that the photoproduct is a PCn+
 radical
 cation, produced in Na,K-ETS-10 and its ion-exchanged
 materials. The stability of this charge separated state
 in Na,K-ETS-10 and its ion-exchanged materials increases
 with alkyl chain length due to an increased inductive effect
 in the PCn+ radical cations as a function of alkyl chain length.Na,K-clinoptilolite
 is the most abundant natural zeolite and
 has found wide applications in ion-exchange, adsorption and
 catalysis.24,25
 Na,K-clinoptilolite molecular sieve is composed
 of 10-ring and 8-ring main channels parallel to each other
 along the c-axis. They are intersected by another 8-ring
 channel that runs along the a-axis. This leads to approximate
 channel dimensions of 7.2×4.4 Å. The negative charge of the
 Na,K-clinoptilolite framework from tetrahedrally coordinated
 aluminium is balanced by Na+ and K+ cations. The Na,K-clinoptilolite
 framework can be modified by varying the
 charge compensating cations ia conventional ion-exchange to optimize
 electron transfer between photosensitive electron donors
 and acceptors.In
 the present study, we have examined the photoionization
 of N-alkylphenothiazines loaded into Na,K-clinoptilolite (Na,K-Clino), H-clinoptilolite (H-Clino), Li-clinoptilolite (Li-Clino),
 Na-clinoptilolite (Na-Clino), K-clinoptilolite (K-Clino),
 Ni-clinoptilolite (Ni-Clino), Co-clinoptilolite (Co-Clino) and
 Cu-clinoptilolite (Co-Clino) molecular sieves and have found
 that the presence of protons, various alkali metal ions and
 transition metal ions in ion-exchanged sites of these Na,K-clinoptilolite/PCn
 materials influences the photoyield of PCn•+ radical
 cations. A combination of techniques, including X-ray diffraction
 (XRD), EPR, thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) and
 UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, were used to 
monitor
 the photophysical properties of the M-clinoptilolite/PCn (M=Na++K+, H+, Li+, Na+, K+, Ni2+, Co2+,
 Cu2+; n=1, 3, 6, 10) materials. The photoyield was found
 to depend on the nature of the metal ion and the channel
 size of the M-clinoptilolite. The photoyield and stability
 of the PCn+
 radical cation show the potential utility of microporous M-clinoptilolite molecular sieves for controlling the
 photoionization of PCn (n=1, 3, 6, 10) molecules.Experimental
 sectionSynthesis of Na,K-clinoptiloliteThe
 synthetic Na,K-clinoptilolite molecular sieve was synthesized
 following the literature procedure.26 Dried aluminium
 hydroxide, Al(OH)3 (USP, Pfaltz & Bauer Inc.), 6 M NaOH
 solution, 6 M KOH solution, colloidal silica (Ludox LS,
 Aldrich) were used without further purification. Deionized
 water was used throughout the synthesis. Syntheses were
 carried out in 10 ml stainless steel autoclaves lined with
 Teflon™ at autogenous pressure without agitation. To
 decrease the crystallization time, seed crystals were added. In
 a typical Na,K-clinoptilolite synthesis, 0.87 g of dried aluminium
 hydroxide was added to a mixture of 0.54 ml 6 M NaOH
 and 2.46 ml 6M KOH solution. After stirring for about
 1 h, 8.26 ml of colloidal silica was added slowly and the mixture
 was further stirred for 1 h. Finally, 0.1 g of seed crystals of synthetic Na,K-clinoptilolite was added to promote crystallization.
 The resulting gel was crystallized hydrothermally
 in Teflon™-lined autoclaves at 453 K for 4 days. The resulting
 gel pH of the mother liquor was 9.6. After crystallization
 the solid product was filtered off, washed with deionized
 water and dried in air at 343 K overnight. The molar composition of the final gel was 0.29NaOH:1.33KOH:1Al(OH)3:4.5SiO2
:54.2H2O. The XRD
 pattern of this sample shows single phase, Na,K-clinoptilolite
 (Fig. 1). Fig. 1  X-Ray
 diffraction pattern of single phase crystalline Na,K-clinoptilolite. Ion-exchangeTo obtain H-clinoptilolite, synthetic Na,K-clinoptilolite was exchanged
 with 1 M ammonium chloride at 343 K overnight followed
 by washing. This procedure was repeated three times. The
 product was calcined in air at 673 K overnight to decompose
 the ammonium ion and obtain H-clinoptilolite.To
 obtain M-clinoptilolite (M=Li+, Na+, K+, Ni2+, Co2+, Cu2+)
 samples were prepared ia ion-exchange with the respective
 metal chloride stock solutions. A mixture of synthetic Na,K-clinoptilolite
 and the alkali metal or transition metal chloride
 1 M stock solution was kept at 343 K while stirring overnight.
 This procedure was repeated three times to 
reach a maximum
 degree of ion-exchange. The final alkali metal or transition
 metal ion exchanged M-clinoptilolite was washed with distilled, deionized water several times and dried in air. The M-clinotilolite
 structure was retained after ion-exchange by metal
 ions and calcination based on the evidence of XRD patterns.CharacterizationXRD
 powder patterns were recorded on a Siemens D 5000
 X-ray diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation of wavelength 1.541
 Å over the range 4°<2θ<50°. EPR spectra were recorded at
 room temperature at 9.5 GHz using a Bruker ESP 300 spectrometer
 with 100 kHz field modulation. The microwave power was
 maintained at 2 mW which is well below the saturation level for irradiated N-alkylphenothiazine samples. The microwave frequency was measured with a Hewlett Packard 5350
 B frequency counter, and the magnetic field was monitored with
 a Bruker ER 032 M Hall effect field controller. The average
 value of the photoinduced PC1•+ or PCn•+ radical cation yield was determined from triplicate experiments for each system by
 double integration of the first derivative EPR spectra using
 the ESP 300 software. Diffuse reflectance UV–vis spectra
 were recorded before and after different times of photoirradiation
 at room temperature using a Perkin-Elmer model 330 spectrophotometer and a Hitachi integrating sphere. TGA of
 the samples was performed using a TGA 2050 analyzer from TA
 Instruments in an oxygen atmosphere at a heating rate
 of 10°C min−1.PhotoirradiationAll
 PCn containing M-clinoptilolite (M=Na++K+, H+, Li+, Na+,
 K+, Ni2+, Co2+, Cu2+) materials were photoirradiated using
 a 300 W Cermax xenon lamp (LX 300 UV) at room temperature.
 The power supply used was from ILC technology which
 was operated at 50% (10 A) of its rated maximum output
 power. For homogeneous irradiation of the samples, each
 sample was rotated at 4 rpm at room temperature. The
 irradiation passed through a filter combination consisting of
 10 cm of water to absorb infrared radiation and a Corning glass
 filter, No. 7-54, to filter light of wavelengths shorter than 320
 nm. The photoinduced PCn•+
 radical cations were identified by
 EPR and diffuse reflectance UV–vis spectroscopy.Samples for
 photoionizationPCn
 (n=1, 3, 6, 10) was incorporated by immersing 0.5 g of each
 into M-clinoptilolite (M=Na++K+, H+, Li+, Na+, K+, Ni2+, Co2+,
 Cu2+) in 1 mL of 1×10−2 M PCn/C6H6 solution overnight.
 The solvent was removed by flowing nitrogen over the sample
 for about 2 h. Thus all the samples contain the same
 amount of PCn. For EPR measurements the same amount (0.3
 g) of PCn (n=1, 3, 6, 10) impregnated dried Clino powder was
 transferred into Suprasil quartz tubes (2 mm i.d.×3 mm o.d.) which were sealed at one end. The filled sample tubes were
 then flame sealed at the other end. For diffuse reflectance
 experiments the samples were loaded into a cylindrical quartz
 sample cell (22 mm diameter×2 cm path length). All the samples
 were prepared in the dark to minimize exposure to visible
 light.ResultsThe
 synthetic Na,K-clinoptilolite zeolites after ion-exchange with
 H+, Li+, Na+, K+, Ni2+, Co2+ or Cu2+ have similar X-ray diffraction
 patterns to Na,K-clinoptilolite zeolite.26 This verifies that
 the Na,K-clinoptilolite structure was retained after ion-exchange
 with different metal ions and calcination.Hydrated Na,K-Clino impregnated with PCn was colorless and
 EPR silent before and after photoirradiation at room tem
perature. However, samples of dehydrated M-clinoptilolite (M=Na++K+,
 H+, Li+, Na+, K+, Ni2+, Co2+ or Cu2+) impregnated with
 PCn molecules are light pink, except for Cu2+ which is
 darker pink, and show very weak EPR signals of PCn•+ at g=2.006
 with partially resolved hyperfine splitting21 before irradiation
 as shown in Fig. 2. This shows that some PCn•+ radical cations are produced during sample preparation in a “
dark” reaction.
 Cu-Clino shows the largest “dark” reaction. After being irradiated
 by 320 nm light at room temperature for 60 min, the samples
 turn deep pink and show strong EPR signals (Fig. 2) at
 g=2.006. This EPR signal and the deep pink color are
 typical of PCn+ radical cations.21 The EPR signal intensity of
 M-clinoptilolite/PCn reaches a plateau after 60 min photoirradiation
 at room temperature. The spectral widths of the EPR
 spectra are consistent with those of PCn+ in layered materials,13
 silica gel,16 microporous21,22 and mesoporous23 materials.
 This indicates photoinduced formation of PCn+ at room temperature
 in M-clinoptilolite (M=Na++K+, H+, Li+, Na+, K+, Ni2+, Co2+,
 Cu2+). The partially resolved EPR spectra of PCn+
 radical cations at room temperature show that the radicals
 have some mobility in the channels of M-clinoptilolite samples
 at room temperature. The deep pink color of the samples
 after photoirradiation is stable when the sample tubes
 are exposed to air or oxygen for several days. The photoproduced
 PCn+ radical cations in M-clinoptilolite are thus stable
 to oxygen at room temperature. Fig. 2  EPR
 spectra of Na,K-Clino/PC1, H-Clino/PC1, Li Clino/PC1, Na-Clino/PC1 and K-Clino/PC1 samples at room temperature before irradiation (a–e) and after a 60 min room temperature photoirradiation at 320 nm (A–E). Fig. 3 shows EPR signal intensity changes of PC1•+
 with irradiation
 time in M-clinoptilolite (M=Na++K+, H+, Li+, Na+, K+,
 Ni2+, Co2+, Cu2+). From Fig. 3 it is seen that the highest photoyield
 is obtained for H-clinoptilolite/PC1
 followed by Ni-clinoptilolite/PC1.
 The EPR signals rapidly increase during the first
 20 min of irradiation and then reach a plateau after about 30
 min. An irradiation time of 60 min was selected for comparative
 photoyield and stability studies. The photoyield of H-clinoptilolite/PC1
 is about twofold higher than the photoyield of
 Na,K-clinoptilolite/PC1. The changes in EPR signal intensities
 of transition metal ions in M-clinoptilolite/PC1 are different
 from those observed for alkali metal ions in M-clinoptilolite/PC1
 for the same irradiation times. As one can see from Fig.
 3, Ni-clinoptilolite/PC1 enhances the photoyield of PC1•+
 radical cations and exhibits maximum photoactivity compared with
 the other transition metal ions and alkali metal ions used.
 The presence of differ
ent types of cocations in M-clinoptilolite
 along with PC1 have a significant influence on the efficiency
 of photoinduced charge separation. Fig. 3  Room
 temperature photoinduced PC1•+ radical cation yield measured by EPR s. light exposure time for M-clinoptilolite (M=Na+ K+, H+, Li+, Na+, K+, Ni2+, Co2+, Cu2+) samples. The chain length of PCn plays a significant role in the photoyield
 and the stability of the photoinduced PCn+ radical cations.13,23
 To examine the effect of alkyl chain length, the photoionization
 of PCn was examined for H-clinoptilolite since
 PCn impregnated H-clinoptilolite exhibits the maximum activity
 and stability. The results obtained from photoionization
 of H-clinoptilolite/PCn (n=1, 3, 6, 10) are shown in Fig. 4. It can
 be seen that the PCn+ photoyields decrease with increasing
 alkyl chain length from methylphenothiazine (PC1) to decylphenothiazine
 (PC10). There is also a significant increase
 in the stability of PCn+ in M-clinoptilolite/PCn from PC1 to PC10.
 It is clear that the photooxidation yield of PCn to PCn+ depends
 strongly on the alkyl chain length. The H-clinoptilolite/PCn
 changes from light pink to green as the alkyl chain length increases beyond PC6. Fig. 4  Room
 temperature photoyield of H-clinoptilolite/PCn, where n=1, 3, 6, 10, measured by EPR after 60 min photoirradiation at room temperature s. the pendent alkyl chain length of the N-alkylphenothiazine. Figs. 5 and 6 show diffuse reflectance spectra of PC1 in
 Na,K-Clino and PC10 in H-Clino before irradiation and after different
 irradiation times at room temperature. These spectra are
 the same as the spectra of PCn+ in microporous21,22 and mesoporous23
 materials in the region from 300 to 800 nm. A prominent
 band around 515 nm is seen. This supports the existence
 of PCn+ in photoirradiated M-clinoptilolite and further
 confirms the photooxidation of PCn into PCn+ in M-clinoptilolite. Fig. 5  UV–vis
 diffuse reflectance spectra of Na,K-clinoptilolite/PC1 samples at room temperature before irradiation and after 5, 15 and 30 min room temperature photoirradiations at 320 nm.  Fig. 6  UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra of H-clinoptilolite/PC10 samples at room temperature before irradiation and after 5 and 25 min room temperature photoirradiations at 320 nm. Fig. 7 shows the structure of the N-alkylphenothiazines. The diameters of PC1, PC3, PC6 and PC10 are about 6.5, 8, 11
 and 14 Å, respectively. Since M-clinoptilolite is a channel type
 zeolite with a main 10-ring channel with an elliptical 
channel
 opening of 7.2×4.4 Å, it is unclear how much different PCn
 (n=1, 3, 6, 10) molecules penetrate into M-clinoptilolite
 (M=Na++K+, H+, Li+, Na+, K+, Ni2+, Co2+, Cu2+). To clarify
 this situation, Fig. 8 shows TGA results obtained from
 the incorporation of PCn (n=1, 3, 10) molecules into H-clinoptilolite.
 All three curves typically show three weight losses,
 the first near 100°C assigned to water desorption, the second
 near 200°C assigned to N-alkylphenothiazine desorption,
 and the third broad peak centered around 470°C which
 is assigned to decomposition of 
N-alkylphenothiazine in an
 oxygen atmosphere. This 470°C peak is not observed when the
 experiments are performed under a nitrogen atmosphere.
 From the TGA results (Fig. 8), we conclude that PC1 penetrates
 to a large extent into H-clinoptilolite channels and
 that PCn only partially penetrates as the alkyl chain length increases,
 depending on the estimated molecular diameter. This
 is consistent with the photoionization results for H-clinoptilolite/PCn
 (n=1, 3, 6, 10) which show a decreasing photoyield
 in the order H-clinoptilolite/PC1>
 H-clinoptilolite/PC3>
 H-clinoptilolite/PC6>H-clinoptilolite/PC10. Fig. 7  Structure
 of N-alkylphenothiazines.  Fig. 8  Differential thermal analysis of H-clinoptilolite/PCn (n=1, 3, 10). DiscussionElectron paramagnetic spin resonance and diffuse reflectance
 results can be used to confirm the existence and identification
 of radical species. In the present study EPR and diffuse reflectance
 were used to detect the radicals present following photoirradiation of PCn in M-clinoptilolite (M=Na++K+, H+, Li+, Na+,
 K+, Ni2+, Co2+, Cu2+). Hydrated Na,K-clinoptilolite/PCn
 showed no EPR signal at room temperature or 77 K following
 photoirradiation at room temperature probably due to
 blocking of the main channels by water molecules. However,
 photoirradiated, dehydrated M-clinoptilolite/PCn
 materials show EPR signals of PCn•+
 radical cations. Fig.
 2 shows the EPR signals of PC1+ in M-clinoptilolite (M=Na++K+, H+,
 Li+, Na+, K+) after 60 min irradiation at room temperature.
 The g-factor (2.006) and the color of irradiated M-clinoptilolite/PCn
 clearly indicate that the only species present following
 photoirradiation is PCn•+ (Fig. 2). The intensity changes
 of the EPR signal due to PC1+ with photoirradiation time for M-clinoptilolite/PC1
 (M=Na++K+, H+, Li+, Na+, K+, Ni2+, Co2+, Cu2+) in Fig.
 3 suggest that protons, alkali metal ions and transition
 metal ions assist the photoionization of PC1 in M-clinoptilolite.
 The role of protons as well as metal ions
 as electron acceptors is evident since there is net photoionization
 of PC1 in H-clinoptilolite and M-clinoptilolite. Note that the
 dark reaction yield at 0 min photoirradiation varies with
 the metal ion and must be subtracted to obtain the net photoyield.
 The net photoionization efficiency decreases in the 
order
 H-clinoptilolite/PC1>Ni-clinoptilolite/PC1>K-clin
optilolite/PC1>Na-clinoptilolite/PC1>Co-clin
optilolite/PC1>Na,K-clinoptilolite/PC1>Li-clin
optilolite/PC1>Cu-clinoptilolite/PC1. Thus the photoionization efficiency is controlled by the nature of the metal ion in the ion-exchange sites of M-clinoptilolite.In
 other photoionization systems,20,27–29 protons and alkali
 metal ions have been found to act as electron acceptors. Previous
 photoionization results from our laboratory21
 demonstrate
 that long-lived charge separation can be achieved 
at
 room temperature in Na,K-ETS-10 by ion-exchange with protons,
 alkali metal ions and transition metal ions.The
 photoyield trend with alkyl chain length shown in Fig.
 4 indicates that the photooxidation yield decreases with an
 increase in alkyl chain length from PC1 to PC3 to PC6 to
 PC10 in H-clinoptilolite/PCn and similar behavior is observed in
 M-clinoptilolite/PCn. The decrease in photoyield observed from
 PC1 to PC10 is most probably a result of the restricted diffusion
 for larger molecules in the channels of M-clinoptilolite.The
 decrease in photoyield of PCn+ with alkyl chain length is
 suggested to be due to an increasing propensity to generate aggregates
 with increasing chain length.30,31
 The formation of such
 aggregates will lower the rate of diffusion of PCn into M-clinoptilolite
 and lead to a diminished photoyield. Diffuse reflectance
 of H-clinoptilolite/PC10 (Fig. 6) also suggests the formation
 of aggregates by the additional absorption between 600 to
 750 nm as the alkyl chain length increases from PC1 to PC10
 (compare Fig. 5 and 6). The green color of photoirradiated
 M-clinoptilolite/PCn at longer alkyl chain lengths also supports
 this. Earlier, several workers have observed the formation
 of a green solution in oxidation reactions of PCn molecules30,31
 and suggested the formation of molecular aggregates.The
 channel diameter of M-clinoptilolite is 7.2 Å which can only
 accommodate a molecule of ⩽7.2 Å. The main channel opening
 of M-clinoptilolite is larger than the size of PC1, so molecules
 such as PC1 can completely penetrate into M-clinoptilolites. However, molecules such as PC3, PC6 or PC10 have larger
 diameters so these molecules are adsorbed more on the
 external surface of M-clinoptilolites and only partly penetrate
 into the channels. Fig. 8 shows TGA results for H-clinoptilolite/PCn. The TGA results suggest that PC1
 penetrates to
 a significant extent and that other PCn molecules only partially
 penetrate into the channels of H-clinoptilolite. This is consistent
 with the photoionization results which show a decreased
 yield with longer alkyl chain length (Fig. 4). The stability
 of PCn+ increases from PC1 to PC10 due to an increased inductive
 effect in PCn+ as a function of longer alkyl chains.13,21,32
 The stability of PCn+ in M-clinoptilolites ranges from a few
 days to several weeks at room temperature depending on the
 specific metal ion which may be related to its electron affinity
 within clinoptilolite. It is noteworthy that the photoyield efficiency
 for PC1 in H-Clino and Ni-Clino is about twice that of
 PC1 in the vanadium silicoaluminophosphate VAPO-5.33ConclusionsLong-lived
 charge separated states can be formed photochemically
 in synthetic M-clinoptilolite/PCn (M=Na++K+, H+, Li+,
 Na+, K+, Ni2+, Co2+, Cu2+; n=1, 3, 6, 10) molecular sieves at
 room temperature. The PCn+ radical cation photoyield depends
 on the nature of the metal ion in the ion-exchange sites of
 M-clinoptilolite samples. H-clinoptilolite/PCn has the highest photoyield followed by Ni-clinoptilolite/PCn when
 compared to other M-clinoptilolite/PCn materials.
 The PCn+ photoyield and stability are also dependent on the
 alkyl chain length. The PCn+
 photoyield decreases in the
 order H-clinoptilolite>Ni-clinoptilolite>K-clinoptilolite>Na-clinoptilolite>Co-clinoptilolite>Na, K-clinoptilolite>Li-clinoptilolite>Cu-clinoptilolite.
 These results demonstrate some of the size/
shape selectivity
 features of synthetic M-clinoptilolite molecular
 sieves on such photochemical reactions. The results also suggest
 that achievement of stable photooxidation at room temperature
 may make it possible to use these materials for efficient
 conversion and storage of photochemical energy.AcknowledgementsThis
