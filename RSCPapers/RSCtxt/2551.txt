    , Accepted 18th April 2017First published on 18th April 2017AbstractThe synergistic effects of a thiophene-based π-bridging backbone extension on the intrinsic and photovoltaic properties of electron donor–acceptor (D–A) copolymers were systematically investigated. A series of alternating D–A copolymers (PBTs) based on 4,8-bis(5-ethylhexylselenophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (EHSeBDT) and 5-(2-butyloctyl)-4H-thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6(5H)-dione (BOTPD), which featured thiophene-based π-bridges, were synthesized: PBT without a π-bridge, PBT with a 3-octylthiophene (OT) π-bridge (PBT-OT), and PBT with a 3-octylthieno[3,2-b]thiophene (OTT) π-bridge (PBT-OTT). The light absorption and charge transport properties were significantly enhanced upon incorporation of the OTT π-bridge. The enhancements resulted from the strong π–π intermolecular interactions using the OTT π-bridging backbone extension between neighboring polymer chains. PBT-OTT was most miscible in PC71BM. As a result, the photoactive layers prepared using PBT-OTT and PC71BM formed a well-mixed bulk-heterojunction morphology and yielded organic solar cells (OSCs) with a high power conversion efficiency of 7.21%. Transient absorption analysis suggested that the π-electrons were further delocalized along the copolymer after incorporation of the OTT π-bridge, and the charge separation efficiency increased. These results suggested that incorporating OTT π-bridges into D–A copolymers provides a useful strategy for developing highly efficient OSCs.
1. Introduction
Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs) can be fabricated using simple solution processes. BHJ OSCs can, therefore, be used to prepare low-cost, lightweight, flexible, and large-area devices.1,2 Recently, BHJ OSCs have achieved power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) > 10% in single-junction devices.3–5 Recent studies have focused on developing new π-conjugated polymer structures featuring alternating donor and acceptor (D–A) moieties to obtain highly efficient OSCs. Until now, D–A copolymers that include alternating D–A moieties have provided the best photovoltaic performances.
Several methods are typically used for the molecular engineering of π-conjugated polymers for use in highly efficient OSCs. First, the electronic structures of the D–A moieties can be modulated to determine the orbital strength, and consequent intramolecular charge transfer within the π-conjugated polymers. Low band gap polymers can be synthesized by increasing the orbital strength.6,7 This strategy can extend the photon absorption spectrum toward the near-infrared region.8 High PCEs in OSCs can be obtained by appropriately selecting the electron donor and electron acceptor moieties in the D–A copolymers.
Second, the side groups on the D–A copolymers can be tuned to increase the OSC efficiency. Modifying the side groups on benzodithiophene (BDT) units can influence important OSC properties, such as the morphology evolution in the blend film,9 the energy levels,10 and the UV-Vis absorption range.11 The bridging nitrogen atom in the thienopyrrolodione (TPD) moiety offers a versatile center for tuning the side groups, for example, by introducing linear or branched alkyl,12,13 alkylbenzyl,14 or alkyloyl groups,15 using facile chemical reactions. The incorporation of bulky alkyl groups into the pyrrole ring of the TPD moiety can increase the solubility of the resulting TPD-based backbones. This success suggested that additional rigid paired donor monomers or π-bridges can be inserted into the polymers to extend the polymer backbone.
Finally, the incorporation of a π-bridge into the D–A copolymers can significantly affect the molecular architecture of the polymers and, therefore, the optoelectronic and photovoltaic properties of the OSCs. For instance, one type of π-bridge, thieno[3,4-b]thiophene (TT), possesses structural advantages, including coplanar fused aromatic rings and a large molecular plane, that can be exploited16 in the synthesis of highly efficient D–A copolymers. The incorporation of a TT π-bridge as a spacer into D–A copolymers can enhance the backbone planarity of the resulting copolymers and thereby extend delocalization of the π-electrons along the π-conjugated backbone. These effects elevate the HOMO energy level in the polymers broadening the light absorption range and enhance the charge carrier mobility, thereby increasing the JSC values of the resultant OSCs. The incorporation of a TT π-bridge into a BDT-benzo-[c][1,2,5]-thiadiazole (BT) backbone increased the JSC value compared to the BDT-BT backbone alone.17 Furthermore, the use of TT π-bridges can diminish steric hindrance between electron-donating and electron-accepting moieties, thereby enhancing intermolecular π–π orbital stacking and inducing well-ordered laminar packing of the resulting polymers. The final morphology of blend films composed of TT π-bridge-based D–A copolymers and PC71BM revealed optimal phase segregation and the formation of bicontinuous networks. These responses increased the fill factor (FF) of OSCs.18 To the best of our knowledge, BDT and BT derivatives that include TT π-bridges have yielded the best PCE values, 9.44%.19
In the present study, 4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)selenophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′] dithiophene (EHSeBDT) was selected as a donor moiety and (2-butyloctyl)-4H-thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6(5H)-dione (BOTPD) was selected as an acceptor moiety20 in an investigation of the effects of the π-bridge. The three designed copolymers included no π-bridge (PBT), a 3-octylthiophene π-bridge (PBT-OT), or a 3-octylthieno[3,2-b]thiophene π-bridge (PBT-OTT) (Fig. 1). Alkylselenophyl as effective side groups on BDT moieties was introduced into D–A copolymers to achieve highly efficient OSCs. D–A copolymers that include Se atoms can display improved π-orbital overlap compared to the copolymers that include S atoms because Se atoms are more polarizable than S atoms.21 The charge carrier mobilities of Se-based polymers can, therefore, be superior to those of S-based polymers.22 The conjugation lengths of the D–A copolymers were extended by incorporating OTT π-bridges into D–A copolymers. This change increased the spectral absorption coefficients, JSC, FF, hole mobilities, and miscibilities with PC71BM. Interestingly, the GI-WAXS data revealed that the π-bridging backbone extension gave unique characteristics to this polymer system. The advantages of the π-bridge provided the PBT-OTT polymer with a PCE of 7.21%. The aim of this study was to evaluate the utility of 3-alkylthieno[3,2-b]thiophene π-bridges in D–A copolymers.

2. Results and discussion
Synthesis and thermal properties
π-Conjugated PBT backbones were extended by installing OT and OTT π-bridges between the donor and acceptor moieties (Fig. 1). The solubilities of the target polymers were maintained, despite the introduction of the π-bridge, by attaching n-octyl groups to the 3′ position of the π-bridges. Three polymers based on the BDT donor and TPD acceptor were prepared via a palladium-catalyzed Stille coupling reaction under fixed polymerization conditions (Scheme S1†). The synthetic procedures are described in detail in the Experimental section.
The number-average molecular weights () and polydispersity indexes (PDI, /) were obtained using high-temperature size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) in trichlorobenzene as the eluent at 220 °C (Table S1†). The solubilities of the three polymers differed. PBT and PBT-OT were reasonably soluble in warm chloroform and toluene, but PBT-OTT was poorly soluble in these solvents. All these polymers displayed good solubility in chlorobenzene (CB). This trait was exploited to fabricate a smooth and pinhole-free photoactive layer. The thermal properties of the polymers were investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) under a N2 atmosphere with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 (Fig. 2a and Table S1†). The onset temperatures of 5% weight loss for the PBT, PBT-OT, and PBT-OTT were 404 °C, 400 °C, and 407 °C, respectively, indicating that the thermal stabilities of the polymers were adequate for use in optoelectronic devices.23 Interestingly, incorporation of the OTT π-bridge had little effect on the thermal stability of the polymer. The thermal properties of the copolymers were characterized using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). No thermal transitions were observed in the synthesized polymers over the temperature range 30–300 °C.

Physicochemical properties and theoretical calculations
The UV-Vis absorption spectra of the three polymers were obtained (Fig. 3a and b). All polymers displayed similar absorption spectra with two characteristic peaks (Fig. 3a) corresponding to the BDT-TPD backbone.24,25 The absorption spectra of the polymers covered the wavelength range 300 ≤ λ ≤ 700 nm due to the presence of a medium band gap. The higher-energy absorption band (300–400 nm) was assigned to localized π–π* transitions and the lower-energy band (500–600 nm) was attributed to strong intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) interactions characteristic of the D–A copolymers.26–28 The UV-Vis absorption spectra (Fig. 3a and b) of all polymers included a vibronic shoulder peak adjacent to the maximum absorption peak in both the solution and film states. The incorporation of π-bridges into the PBT polymeric backbone reduced the intensities of the vibronic shoulder peaks (600 ≤ λ ≤ 620 nm) of PBT-OT and PBT-OTT.29

In the thin films of PBT-OTT, λmax underwent a bathochromic shift (20 nm) and the ICT strength increased, compared to the corresponding features of PBT-OT (Fig. 3b). The red-shifted absorption band was attributed to the extended PBT-OTT backbone, which facilitated intermolecular π–π stacking interactions.30,31 The absorption coefficient of PBT-OTT was the highest measured among the polymers (Fig. 3b). In the wavelength range (300–580 nm), the absorption coefficient of PBT-OT was superior to that of PBT. On the other hand, in the wavelength range (580–700 nm), their absorption coefficients were reversed.32
The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the polymers were determined by measuring their electrochemical properties using cyclic voltammetry (CV) (Fig. 2b). The HOMO energy levels of the PBT, PBT-OT, and PBT-OTT films were −5.85, −5.78, and −5.56 eV, and the LUMO energy levels were −3.51, −3.56, and −3.57 eV, respectively (Table 1). The HOMO levels of the polymers gradually increased as the electron-donating strength of the π-bridge and its ability to form connections between BDT and TPD units increased from no π-bridge to the OT π-bridge and then to the OTT π-bridge.33 All polymers featured deep HOMO energy levels that guaranteed good stability in air.34 The LUMO energy levels of copolymers decreased slightly by incorporating π-bridges into PBT as their π-conjugation lengths were extended. These values were all higher than the LUMO energy level of PC71BM (−4.2 eV).35 A sufficiently large difference between the LUMO energy levels of the polymer and PC71BM facilitated efficient exciton dissociation and electron charge transfer.36

Computational studies using density functional theory (DFT) calculations were explored to determine the influence of the π-bridges on the molecular orbital distribution and the molecular architecture of the copolymers, using the B3LYP/6-31G* model, on trimers (tri-BT, tri-BT-OT, and tri-BT-OTT) bearing methyl-substituted alkyl chains for simplicity. Optimized geometries of the copolymers in an energy-minimized structure are shown in Fig. 4. The electron densities in the frontier orbitals of the trimer HOMO and LUMO levels were delocalized across the conjugated polymer backbones (Fig. 4). Interestingly, the electron densities of the HOMO and LUMO wave functions in the BT-OTT trimer were more delocalized than those in the BT and BT-OT trimers.

The dihedral angles between the π-bridge and the BDT unit were slightly increased (θ1: 21.08° and θ2: 21.13° for PBT-OT; θ1: 27.35° and θ2: 24.85° for PBT-OTT) due to the larger size of 3-methylthieno[3,2-b]thiophene than 3-methylthiophene units (Fig. S2 and Table S3†). Compared with those between BDT and TPD units for PBT (θ1: 1.45° and θ2: 2.08°), the increase of dihedral angles would be attributed to the steric hindrance of methyl substituents on the π-bridges (Fig. S2 and Table S3†). However, the influence of the steric hindrance turned out not to be so severe that molecular ordering and charge carrier mobility remain high, as discussed in the next section.
Charge transport properties
Organic field effect transistors (OFETs) were fabricated to evaluate how the π-bridge backbone extension affected the carrier transport properties of the polymers. All polymers exhibited typical p-type hole-transport properties (Fig. S4† and Table 2). The OFET hole mobilities of all polymers increased by a factor of 10 after thermal annealing at 240 °C. The calculated hole mobilities of PBT, PBT-OT, and PBT-OTT were 1.73 × 10−4, 1.55 × 10−3, and 1.48 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The OFETs prepared using PBT-OTT displayed the highest carrier mobility. Incorporating the OTT π-bridge into PBT can provide a chance to decrease steric hindrance between two bulky and branched alkyl chains (2-ethylhexyl on the BDT unit and 2-butyloctyl on the TPD unit), which can mirror high charge carrier mobility and molecular ordering of the copolymers.

The origin of the high hole mobility in the OTT π-bridged polymers was explored by examining the morphology and crystalline ordering of the OFET active layer using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and grazing incidence-wide angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS). After thermal annealing at 240 °C, the polycrystalline grains of the polymers increased in size, as shown in the AFM images (Fig. S4†). The enlarged grains provided efficient channels for charge carrier transport. The root-mean-square roughness values, Rrms, of all polymer films increased after thermal annealing at 240 °C (from 0.52, 0.36, and 0.48 nm to 0.62, 0.68, and 0.53 nm, for PBT, PBT-OT, and PBT-OTT, respectively).
The samples for GIWAXS measurements were spin-coated from the CB solution atop octadecyltrichlorosilane (ODTS)-treated SiO2/Si substrates. As shown in GI-WAXS (Fig. 5), PBT and PBT-OT displayed bimodal orientations, with face-on and edge-on arrangements, whereas PBT-OTT displayed a face-on orientation and produced the highest intensity peaks after thermal annealing at 240 °C. It should be noted that the (100) d-spacing and π–π stacking distances in PBT-OTT were the smallest measured among the polymers (Table S2†). It was likely to decrease the energy barrier to intermolecular charge hopping and facilitate charge transport, despite the face-on orientation.37,38

Photovoltaic properties
The effects of the π-bridges on the OSC photovoltaic performances were investigated (Fig. 6a and Table 3). The PBT-based OSC was characterized by JSC = 1.89 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.81 V, and FF = 41.9%, with PCE = 0.64%. Incorporation of the OT and OTT π-bridges into the PBT polymeric backbone increased the JSC values to 5.79 and 10.98 mA cm−2, and the PCE increased to 2.39% and 5.35% for the PBT-OT and PBT-OTT-based OSCs, respectively. Moreover, the addition of DIO further increased JSC for all polymers to 2.52, 8.15, and 12.19 mA cm−2, for the PBT, PBT-OT, and PBT-OTT-based OSCs, respectively. Under optimum conditions, the PBT-OTT-based OSC yielded JSC = 12.19 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.87 V, and FF = 68.0% with a PCE of up to 7.21%.

The addition of DIO significantly increased JSC from 2.52 in the PBT-based OSC to 8.15 and 12.19 mA cm−2 in the PBT-OT- and OTT-based OSCs, respectively. These increases were attributed to a favorable morphology evolution, as discussed in the next section. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) increased over the entire absorption range after the π-bridges had been incorporated into PBT and DIO was added to the solution (Fig. 6b). The presence of the π-bridges in PBT reduced the series resistance (RS) significantly from 82.9 Ω cm2 to 23.9 and 14.4 Ω cm2, providing efficient charge transport in the PBT-, PBT-OT, and PBT-OTT-based OSCs, respectively. The DIO addition further reduced RS and increased the shunt resistance (RSh) to prevent leakage current.
The S factors (Table 3) represent the dependence of the photocurrent, Jph, on the incident light power. This dependence was 1 when space charges were absent and approached 0.75 when space charges imposed limitations.39 Space charge occurs when electron and hole collection rates are unbalanced due to a mobility difference and results in rampant charge carrier recombination. At an effective voltage Veff = V0 − V = 2.5 V near the short circuit conditions, the S factors approached 1 after the π-bridges had been incorporated. This trend suggested that the space charge was reduced due to increased hole mobility with a π-bridge. At Veff = 0.3 V, near the open circuit conditions, the S factor of the PBT-OTT-based OSC approached 1, even though charge carrier recombination occurred vigorously near the open circuit conditions. This trend suggested that charge carrier recombination was less common in the PBT-OTT-based OSC than in the PBT-based and PBT-OT-based OSCs. The DIO addition allowed the S factors to approach 1 by further reducing space charge and charge carrier recombination.
The OSCs prepared from PBT-OT or PBT-OTT displayed a VOC of 0.91 and 0.84 V, respectively, mirroring the trend associated with the increased HOMO level energies;40 however, the PBT-based OSC provided the lowest VOC, 0.81 V, even though the HOMO level of PBT was the deepest among the synthesized polymers. This low VOC presumably resulted from the extensive phase separation (Fig. 7) and the incompletely formed built-in potential resulting from space charge.41,42 The addition of DIO increased VOC to 0.86, 0.95, and 0.87 V for the PBT, PBT-OT, and PBT-OTT-based OSCs, respectively.

The OSCs that used PBT, PBT-OT, and PBT-OTT had FFs of 41.9, 45.3, and 58.0%, respectively. The FF is determined by disproportionate charge collection with balanced charge transport.40 Incorporating the OTT π-bridge considerably increased the FF due to enhanced charge transport with reduced charge accumulation. Moreover, the DIO addition substantially increased the FFs to 48.8, 60.3, and 68.0% for the PBT-, PBT-OT-, and PBT-OTT-based PSCs, respectively, by balancing charge collection and preventing electrical shunt pathways.
Thin film morphology and molecular ordering
AFM and TEM analyses were performed to investigate how the OTT π-bridge backbone extension affected the BHJ morphologies and to characterize the relationship between the morphologies and the photovoltaic properties of the blends (Fig. 7 and S7†). The short exciton diffusion length (Ld < 20 nm) means that nano-scale phase separation with a bi-continuous interpenetrating network of the polymer and PC71BM phases is preferred for efficient exciton dissociation and charge transport.43,44 The PBT blend film showed large-scale phase separation with islands in the matrix. The dark islands correspond to electron-rich PC71BM clusters.45 The PC71BM islands were 100–200 nm in size, and the PBT:PC71BM matrix surrounded the islands. Exciton dissociation did not occur efficiently due to the large-scale island-containing phase separation, and electron transport pathways were not constructed. As a result, this device displayed the lowest photovoltaic properties. Incorporation of the OT π-bridge into the PBT increased the miscibility between the PBT-OT and PC71BM phases (Fig. 7 and S7†). The bright PBT-OT-dominant phases and dark PC71BM-dominant phases were separated by <35 nm. The blend film surface became smooth, with an Rrms = 0.86 nm, much lower than that of the PBT-based blend film (Rrms = 3.05 nm). Incorporation of the OTT π-bridge further increased the compatibility between the PBT-OTT and PC71BM, resulting in small-scale phase separation (Fig. 7 and S7†): the PBT-OTT-dominant phase and PC71BM-dominant phase were separated by <15 nm, and the Rrms was 0.72 nm. As a result, exciton dissociation occurred effectively, coinciding with JSC increase.
The blend film morphologies were obtained to improve exciton dissociation and charge transport by adding a processing additive (DIO) to the polymer:PC71BM blends.46,47 The DIO additive affects the BHJ morphologies differently depending on the miscibilities of the polymer and PCBM; finer phase separation48,49 or coarser phase separation.50,51 DIO dissolved large PC71BM clusters in the PBT-based blend and improved their miscibility with the PBT to give a finer phase separation. The phase separation scale, however, remained relatively large and the JSC, VOC, and FF of PBT increased slightly. In the PBT-OT- and PBT-OTT-based blend films, which featured intimately mixed PC71BM, DIO dissolved the PC71BM phases during film formation, leading to coarser phase separation with a bi-continuous interpenetrating network of both the polymer and the PC71BM. Films containing PBT-OT and PBT-OTT displayed a phase separation scale of <20 nm, which was optimal for exciton dissociation. The PBT-OT blend film, however, displayed localized phase separation, whereas the PBT-OTT blend film displayed uniform phase separation over the whole area. The highest JSC = 12.19 mA cm−2 and the highest FF = 68.0% were obtained in the PBT-OTT blend device. VOC also increased from 0.84 to 0.87 V.
GI-WAXS studies were conducted to investigate the characteristics of the polymer nanostructures and crystalline domains in the blend films (Fig. 7). The films for GIWAXS measurements were prepared from CB blends atop PEDOT:PSS-coated Si wafers. The bimodal orientations in the PBT and PBT-OT films and the face-on orientation in the PBT-OTT film were disrupted by the incorporation of PC71BM (Fig. 5vs.7). The crystal orientations of the polymers in the blend films became random, with a dominant edge-on orientation only in the PBT blend film. Furthermore, the (100) peak intensities corresponding to lamellar packing of the polymer decreased because PC71BM mixed with the polymers intimately and disrupted polymer packing, except in the PBT blend film. In the PBT blend film, PBT and PC71BM did not mix well, so a strong (100) peak corresponding to PBT remained present. Although PC71BM was incorporated, the (100) lamellar distance in the polymers remained unchanged.
The crystalline domain sizes in the blend films were compared by calculating the correlation length using the Scherrer equation52 based on the full-width at half maximum (FWHM) of the (100) peak (Table S7†). In the presence of the OT and OTT π-bridges, the polymers were highly compatible with PC71BM, and the correlation lengths were small, 61.6 and 55.3 Å for PBT-OT and PBT-OTT, respectively. These results were consistent with the nanoscale phase separation in the AFM and TEM images. Without the π-bridge, mixing between PBT and PC71BM was not preferred, and the correlation length was large, 128.0 Å. When DIO was added, the crystal orientations and crystalline ordering did not change significantly, but the crystalline domain size increased.
The compatibility of the polymers with PC71BM was explored by comparing the surface energies of the polymers and PC71BM (Tables S1 and S8†). Similar surface energies resulted in good compatibility between the polymers and PC71BM and a homogeneous and well-mixed blend film.53,54 The surface energy of PC71BM was measured to be 29.1 mN m−1, in agreement with the reported value.55 The surface energy of PBT-OTT was most similar to that of PC71BM. Therefore, this polymer displayed the highest miscibility with PC71BM, and the two components formed a smooth surface with a well-mixed morphology.
Transient absorption spectroscopy
Transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy was carried out to investigate the recombination dynamics in the PBT/PC71BM, PBT-OT/PC71BM, PBT-OTT/PC71BM blends prepared with and without DIO. These studies also considered whether extended delocalization caused by the introduction of a π-bridge into PBT could increase the charge separation efficiency at the polymer/PC71BM interface and enhance the PCEs in the OSCs. TA pump-probe spectroscopy studies were conducted by exciting samples at 550 nm using an ultrashort pump pulse. The induced differential absorption of the excited states generated by the pump pulse was then measured using a probe pulse at 1150 nm. This region is assigned for polaron absorption.56 The TA spectra of the three blends at 550 nm excitation are presented in Fig. S8.† In all three blends, the TA spectra at early delay times (0.5 ps) exhibited a broad absorption peaking around 1200 nm; however, at later delay times (5 ps and 100 ps), the peak position shifted to 1350 nm in the PBT blend, whereas the PBT-OT and PBT-OTT blends reached maxima at 1250 nm. The TA kinetics of the PBT, PBT-OT, and PBT-OTT blends prepared with or without DIO at an excitation pump fluence of 5 × 1013 ph per cm2 per pulse are displayed in Fig. 8a. The high fluence traces could be fit to a multi-exponential that included deconvolution of the instrument response function. The estimated decay time values are listed in Table S9.† These kinetics agree with those reported previously.57–60

(b) Time correlated single photon counting fluorescence measurements of polymer/PC71BM (1:1.5, w/w) blends. Dark lines represent their non-exponential fits. 
The transient absorption profiles of the PBT, PBT-OT, and PBT-OTT blends are shown in Fig. 8a. The decay constants τ1 obtained from the blends not treated with DIO were 1.42, 0.80, and 0.60 ps, and the DIO-treated blends yielded 0.94, 0.80, and 0.62 ps. The decay constants τ2 for the DIO-untreated blends were 20, 25, and 27 ps, and for the DIO-treated blends they were 30, 16, and 16 ps. The decay constants τ3 for the DIO-untreated blends were 400, 550, and 550 ps, and for the DIO-treated blends they were 600, 650 and 700 ps. The PBT, PBT-OT, and PBT-OTT blends displayed multi-step processes at a high fluence, indicating the presence of charge formation and excited state charge pair annihilation processes.57,58 The first decay component τ1 showed rapid decay and was assigned to the early processes, such as singlet–singlet annihilation57,58,61 and charge pair formation.64 The addition of the OT and the OTT π-bridges to the PBT molecule sped up the early processes in the PBT-OT and PBT-OTT blends due to an increase in the carrier densities. By comparison to the decay time regimes measured in other bulk-heterojunction OSCs, the τ2 decay constant was assigned to charge separation processes.61–65 The second decay constant, τ2, displayed an increasing trend in PBT, PBT-OT, and PBT-OTT in the DIO-untreated blends. These results indicated that charge separation had occurred on a quite early time scale, around 20 ps, in the PBT blend, whereas it was around 25 and 27 ps, in the PBT-OT and PBT-OTT blends, respectively. The charge separation time scales are quite similar to previously published reports.65 Seeing the τ3 time constants (400 ps) in the PBT blend suggested that charge separation was hindered by early recombination. These results clearly indicated that charge dissociation in the PBT blend was more localized and the dissociated charges were confined to the polymer and PC71BM molecules due to the limited phase separation. The limited phase separation is clearly visible in the morphologies highlighted by the TEM images. The addition of π-bridges, such as -OT or -OTT, to the PBT polymeric backbone increased the extent of charge separation by constructing electron transport pathways that most likely decreased the energy barrier to intermolecular charge hopping and facilitated charge transport. Therefore, charge separation occurred over a relatively long timescale due to the small-scale phase separation between the polymer and PC71BM domains. Charge separation in the PBT-OT blend began slightly earlier than in the PBT-OTT blend because separation was affected by both the localized and delocalized charge separation, as confirmed by the GI-WAXS structural and morphological analysis, as discussed above. In both the PBT-OT and PBT-OTT blends, charge separation increased over a longer period of time, indicating the impact of adding π-bridges to the PBT blends.
The DIO-treated PBT, PBT-OT, and PBT-OTT blends displayed a decreasing trend in the charge separation compared to the DIO-untreated blends. Charge separation in the PBT-OT and PBT-OTT blends had occurred quite early, around 16 ps, because the PBT-OT and PBT-OTT phases mixed well with PC71BM, leading to nanoscale phase separation and a higher extent of delocalization. The charge separation region in these two blends became quite longer, extending to 650 ps and 700 ps (τ3), which indicated that the well-mixed morphology reduced the coulombic attraction and stabilized the separated charges, permitting their collection at longer times.
The decay time τ3 at a high pump fluence was assigned to the early part of recombination processes. The time window was limited to 1 ns, and so insights into the recombination processes projected the behaviors of the PBT, PBT-OT, and PBT-OTT blends. The time constants τ3 obtained from the DIO-treated or -untreated blends, as listed in Table S9† indicated that longer charge separation durations were accompanied by less recombination. The PBT blend prepared without DIO may have been affected by a variety of charge carrier recombination processes, whereas the addition of spacers, such as -OT or -OTT to the PBT polymeric backbone, along with DIO treatment, reduced the bimolecular recombination losses.
Charge transfer loss in the PBT, PBT-OT, and PBT-OTT blends was characterized by measuring the fluorescence decay curves using time-correlated single photon counting, as shown in Fig. 8b. The PBT, PBT-OT, and PBT-OTT blends were excited at the wavelength of the polymer peak maxima, 675 nm, 690 nm, and 750 nm, and detection occurred at 765 nm, 740 nm, and 770 nm, respectively. The fluorescence spectra of the PBT, PBT-OT, and PBT-OTT polymers and their blends with PC71BM are plotted in Fig. S9.† The fluorescence emission spectra obtained from the blends were extensively quenched. The blend curves were fit to bi-exponential decay models, and the obtained lifetimes are listed in Table S10.† The longer lifetimes suggested a broad distribution of the charge transfer state.64 The photoluminescence decay obtained from the photo-excited PBT blend showed fluorescence quenching with a long lifetime component of 2.34 ns, suggesting a loss of charges due to the disappearance of charge emitting states. The other two blends, PBT-OT and PBT-OTT, displayed efficient charge transfer, and both provided comparable short lifetime components of 1.89 ns, suggesting that the distributions of CT states in these blends were similar. The PBT-OT and PBT-OTT blends showed slightly faster fluorescence decay processes than the PBT blend, suggesting efficient charge transfer to PC71BM. The results confirmed that the CT decay is indicative of recombination losses which start from 100 ps and go up to 15 ns. These losses were similar in the PBT-OT and PBT-OTT blends, whereas the PBT blend decays in a complex manner for a long period of time.
3. Conclusions
A series of D–A copolymers, PBT (prepared without a π-bridge), PBT-OT (prepared with a 3-octylthiophene π-bridge), and PBT-OTT (prepared with a 3-octylthieno[3,2-b]thiophene π-bridge), based on the BDT donor moiety and TPD acceptor moiety were synthesized via Stille coupling polymerization under fixed conditions. The highest PCEs measured from these BHJ solar cells were 1.05% (PBT), 4.67% (PBT-OT), and 7.21% (PBT-OTT). The incorporation of OTT π-bridges into PBT extended the delocalization length along the PBT-OTT backbone and strengthened the π–π intermolecular interactions between neighboring PBT-OTTs, leading to a high hole mobility and high absorption coefficients in the neat polymer. PBT-OTT displayed the best miscibility with PC71BM. The blend of PBT-OTT and PC71BM formed an interpenetrating bicontinuous network with a large interfacial area, which resulted in efficient charge separation and charge transport, while suppressing charge recombination. These results indicated that the OTT π-bridge backbone extension worked synergistically with PBT. 3-Alkylthieno[3,2-b]thiophene appears to be essential as a π-bridge in the D–A copolymers of highly efficient OSCs.

Fabrication and characterization of the OTFTs
The OFET devices were fabricated on ODTS-treated SiO2/Si substrates. A highly doped Si wafer and a 300 nm thick thermally grown oxide layer were used as the gate electrode and gate dielectric. The polymer thin films were spin-coated at 3000 rpm using a 0.5 wt% CB solution and were submitted to thermal annealing under a N2 atmosphere. The source/drain electrodes were thermally evaporated to form channel lengths and widths of 100 μm and 1000 μm, respectively. The electrical properties of the devices were measured at room temperature under vacuum conditions using a Keithley 4200-SCS Semiconductor Parameter Analyzer. The field effect mobilities (μ) and the threshold voltages (Vth) were characterized in the saturation regime (VD = 60 V) according to the following equation:66, where ID is the drain current, Cg is the capacitance of the gate dielectric, and VGS is the gate–source voltage.
Fabrication and characterization of the OSCs
The devices were fabricated with the following structure: ITO/PEDOT:PSS/photoactive layer (polymer:PC71BM)/LiF/Al. The ITO glasses were cleaned in detergent, deionized water, acetone, and 2-propanol with ultrasonication for 15 min each. After UV-ozone treatment for 20 min, PEDOT:PSS was spin-cast to a 40 nm layer thickness, dried at 120 °C for 30 min, and transferred into a glovebox. PBT, PBT-OT, and PBT-OTT were blended with PC71BM in CB at 55 °C overnight in a glovebox. DIO was added 1 h prior to depositing the photoactive layer with cooling. The controlled photoactive layer was deposited by spin-casting the blend solution and drying for 1 h under a N2 environment. The metal cathode [LiF (0.6 nm)/Al (120 nm)] was thermally evaporated through a shadow mask under high vacuum conditions (3 × 10−6 Torr) to form an actual device area of 0.0555 cm2. The J–V characteristics were measured using a source measurement unit (Keithley 4200) under AM 1.5 G solar illumination (Oriel 1 kW solar simulator) at an intensity of 100 mW cm−2 in a N2-filled glovebox. The EQE was measured using an IQE200 (Newport).
GI-WAXS analysis
GI-WAXS measurements were conducted at Beamlines 3C and 9A of the Pohang Accelerator Laboratory (PAL). The photon energy is 10.6408 keV (λ = 1.1651 Å). The GI-WAXS images shown are normalized with respect to the exposure time.

General synthetic procedure of polymers
The distannyl donor (0.5 mmol) and dibromo acceptor (0.5 mmol) were mixed in anhydrous toluene (20 mL) and DMF (2 mL). The solution was flushed with argon for 15 min, and Pd2dba3 (13.7 mg, 3 mmol%) and P(o-Tolyl)3 (7.6 mg, 5 mmol%) were added to the flask. The mixture was purged with argon for 25 min. The polymerization reaction was heated to 110 °C carefully, and the mixture was stirred for 48 h under an argon atmosphere. An excess of 2-(tributylstannyl)thiophene was added to the reaction. After 5 h, an excess of 2-bromothiophene was added. The mixture was stirred overnight to complete the end-capping reaction. The reaction was cooled to room temperature, and subsequently added dropwise to methanol (300 mL). The precipitate was filtered and purified by Soxhlet extraction with methanol, acetone, hexane, and chloroform in succession. The fractions were collected, concentrated, reprecipitated in methanol, and dried under vacuum at 40 °C overnight. The polymers were characterized by elemental analysis and gel permeation chromatography.
