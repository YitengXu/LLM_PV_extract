    , Accepted 24th July 2014First published on 25th July 2014AbstractFe3O4 with hierarchical structures was successfully synthesized and introduced into dye-sensitized solar cells as the counter electrode. A power conversion efficiency of 7.65% based on Fe3O4 was achieved, which is superior to that of pyrolytic Pt (6.88%) and close to that for sputtered Pt (7.87%).
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) are promising candidates for future clean energy supplying, and have attracted widespread attention because of their superior features, such as high efficiency, simple and environmentally friendly fabrication procedures, as well as flexible design of colors and patterns.1 A power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 13.0% has been achieved for DSCs in 2014, making them more feasible for practical applications.2 A typical DSC is usually composed of a dye-sensitized photoanode, an electrolyte with a redox couple (i.e., I3−/I−) and a counter electrode (CE), which actually acts as a catalyst for the reduction of I3− to I−.1 Abundantly available CE materials with high electrocatalytic activity are desired in order to achieve high efficiency and reduce the costs of DSCs. Pt is a highly efficient catalytic material that has been traditionally used as a CE in DSCs. But it is also a noble metal, scarce and thus, not favored for use in large-scale fabrications of DSCs. In recent years, certain forms of carbon, functional polymers, and even inorganic materials have also been shown to be efficient and, are thus regarded as promising candidates for CE in DSCs.3–21 There remain none the less some deficiencies of DSCs that need to be overcome, such as their high production costs. In addition, certain aspects of the preparation procedures are complicated and hinder large-area applications, because they are not very reproducible, are unstable, and so on. Therefore, developing a new CE catalysis which has low cost, a simple procedure and high electrocatalytic activity is highly desirable.
Iron (Fe) is a transition metal and is the fourth most abundant element on Earth. Meanwhile, iron compounds can be formed with different compositions, valence states and crystal phases. In recent years, nanostructures of iron compounds such as oxides, carbides and sulfides have been widely developed for catalysis,22,23 electrodes of secondary batteries,24–27 wastewater treatment28,29 and targeted agents in biomedicine.30 Additionally, in the field of DSCs, FeS2,31 rosin carbon/Fe3O4 (ref. 32) and graphitic carbon/Fe3C33 have been used as CE catalysts and perform well. Recently, via first-principle quantum chemical calculations, Yang and co-workers theoretically predicted and experimentally confirmed that α-Fe2O3 is a superior catalyst for fabrication of CEs in DSCs.34
Another important iron compound is Fe3O4, which is a conductor. Its unit cell contains 32 oxygen and 24 Fe atoms, amongst which one-third are in the form of Fe3+ and occupy 8 (out of 64) of the tetrahedron interstices, whereas two-thirds occupy 16 (out of 32) octahedron interstices with equal numbers of Fe2+ and Fe3+. Therefore, electrons can be transferred through hopping along the octahedral iron chains.35 Until now, few studies were published on applications of materials with different valence states in DSCs.
In this research, micron-sized Fe3O4 “flowers” composed of nanosheets were prepared using a hydrothermal process. Using a controlled annealing process, phase transformation from Fe3O4 to α-Fe2O3 or γ-Fe2O3 was achieved and the original morphology of the hierarchical structure was almost unaffected. These three iron oxides were applied as CEs for DSCs. The results showed that, compared with α-Fe2O3, both Fe3O4 and γ-Fe2O3 were superior in terms of electrocatalytic activity and photovoltaic performance in DSCs. Furthermore, by optimizing the nanostructure of Fe3O4, further photovoltaic improvements were realized.
In order to better understand the formation of the flower-like Fe3O4, we extracted the products at different reaction stages, as shown in Fig. 1. Fig. 1(a) shows that at an early stage (165 °C), there are only nano-sized Fe3O4 particles. Upon increasing the temperature at which the synthesis was carried out to 175 °C, a few micron-sized hierarchical flowers could be observed (Fig. 1(b)). At 185 °C, hierarchical flowers became the dominant structures and their sizes further increased, as shown in Fig. 1(c). Finally, for the product extracted at 195 °C, no nanoparticles remained and the sample was entirely composed of the flower-like Fe3O4 (Fig. 1(d)). It appears that external energy is crucial for oriented aggregation to occur, and thus, to form the two-dimensional nanosheets arranged hierarchically in the Fe3O4 flower. Phase transformation from Fe3O4 to α-Fe2O3 or γ-Fe2O3 was achieved by controlling the sintering temperature and the atmospheric pressure, as shown in the ESI.† Using this strategy, we hardly found any morphology change (see Fig. S1†). The relevant XRD patterns and detailed peak assignments are summarized in Fig. 2.

Fig. 3(a) shows J–V curves under one sun illumination (AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2) for the DSCs using five kinds of CEs: α-Fe2O3, Fe3O4, and γ-Fe2O3, which are described previously, as well as pyrolytic Pt and sputtered Pt, which are two widely used reference CEs. The values of open-circuit photovoltage (Voc), short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc), fill factor (FF) and PCEs are summarized in Table 1. With comparable values, however, DSCs based on α-Fe2O3 gave relative low FF, thus the PCE was only 5.59%. In contrast, DSCs based on γ-Fe2O3 and Fe3O4 both exhibited improved FFs and PCEs. As CEs for DSCs, the photovoltaic performance increased from α-Fe2O3, γ-Fe2O3 to Fe3O4. Our findings in this work suggest that γ-Fe2O3 and Fe3O4 are superior to α-Fe2O3 and are good candidate materials for CEs of DSCs. The PCE of 6.80% for Fe3O4-based DCSs was close to that based on pyrolytic Pt, but still lower than that of 7.93% for the one based on sputtered Pt. In order to study the difference of performance, the inherent mechanism affecting performances of DSCs should be revealed in detail.

Cyclic voltammetry (CV), Tafel polarization curves and electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were carried out to systematically reveal the relationship between catalytic activity and different iron oxides. Fig. 3(b) shows the four CV curves based on three iron oxide CEs and the sputtered Pt. Two pairs of redox peaks are observed in all of the curves. The redox peaks can be assigned to the following two reactions: I3− + 2e−  3I− (for the lower potential peaks), 3I2 + 2e−  2I3− (for the higher potential peaks). According to the former reaction, the CV plots show a cathodic reduction peak (Red-1) and an anodic oxide peak (Ox-1), corresponding to the reduction of I3− and oxidation of I−, respectively. Under the working conditions of the DSCs, the CE is mainly responsible for catalyzing the reduction of I3− to I−. Therefore, the left redox peak is the key object to study to understand the electrocatalytic activity. As shown in Fig. 3(b), the peak-to-peak separations (Epp) are 0.572 V, 0.452 V and 0.372 V for α-Fe2O3, γ-Fe2O3 and Fe3O4, respectively. The comparatively small Epp and high cathodic peak current density of Fe3O4, together indicate that it is a more efficient electrocatalyst than are the other iron oxides in this experiment.8Fig. 3(c) shows the Tafel polarization curves of the symmetrical cells composed of two same CEs and electrolyte (CE/electrolyte/CE). The cell based on Fe3O4 clearly shows a larger slope than do the cells based on the other iron oxides, indicating a higher exchange current density (J0) and limiting current density (Jlim). The results also confirm that, of the three iron oxides, Fe3O4 provided a CE with the highest electrocatalytic activity. The Nyquist curves based on the symmetrical cells are shown in Fig. 3(d) and values derived from these curves are summarized in Table 1. Typically, there are two semicircles, which are defined as charge-transfer resistance (Rct) at the CE/electrolyte interface (left semicircle) and Nernst diffusion impedance (ZN) of the redox couple in the electrolyte (right semicircle). The high frequency intercept on the real axis shows the series resistance (Rs). The Rct value for the Fe3O4 CE is 4.30 Ω, which is much lower than that of the α-Fe2O3 CE (99.71 Ω) and that of the γ-Fe2O3 CE (17.74 Ω), and close to that for sputtered Pt (1.77 Ω). This means that the Fe3O4 CE is more active than the CEs of other iron oxides for reducing I3−. The ZN is usually related to the diffusion rate of the redox couple in electrolyte. Generally, the diffusion rate of an ion is strongly related to the physical structure of materials without regard to the interactions between the material and the ions. However, in the CE/electrolyte interface, the main role of the CE is to accelerate the catalytic reduction of I3−. Because of the different catalytic activities of the three iron oxides, as shown in the CV and Tafel curves, different I− concentrations will be generated. In other words, the higher catalytic activity is accompanied by a higher concentration of I−, and a higher diffusion driving force, which results in the different diffusion resistances of α-Fe2O3, γ-Fe2O3, and Fe3O4 CEs. Therefore, different catalytic activities should yield different values for ZN for similar physical structures. For I3− on the Fe3O4 CE, the value is 4.28 Ω, which is much smaller than those for α-Fe2O3 CE (95.63 Ω) and γ-Fe2O3 CE (14.15 Ω) under the same test conditions. Apparently, the improved power conversion efficiency is attributed to the decrease of both Rct and ZN when an Fe3O4 counter electrode was employed.

Fig. 4 shows the photovoltaic parameters derived from J–V measurements of a series of DSCs based on different CEs. It is clear that all the parameters of DSCs constructed with different CEs show good repeatability (for the same conditions). The error bars are also shown in Tables 1 and 2 for comparison. The relevant statistical analysis was also performed and is shown in ESI.†

The more active sites a catalyst has, the more active it will become. In this work, we optimized the nanostructure of a Fe3O4 flower. Fig. 5 shows the J–V curves of DSCs based on Fe3O4 CE with different concentrations of reactants, where the concentration was decreased to a half (Fe3O4-0.5) and a tenth (Fe3O4-0.1) of the original value (Fig. 1(d)). The SEM image of Fe3O4-0.1 is also shown in Fig. 5 as an illustration. Together with the decrease of concentration, we successfully enhanced the nanosheet packing density and the homogeneity of the Fe3O4 hierarchical flowers. Thus, within a given volume or thickness, our improved Fe3O4 flowers can offer more reaction sites. The detailed J–V parameters are summarized in Table 2. Fe3O4-0.1-based DSCs demonstrate a notable PCE of 7.65%, which is much higher than the values of Fe3O4 and Fe3O4-0.5, and which is superior to the value of pyrolytic Pt (6.88%) and close to that of the sputtered Pt (7.87%). For comparison, the statistical analysis of comparisons of PCEs for solar cells were also conducted (see last section of ESI†), which provide additional support for our conclusions about the photovoltaic performance of the developed Fe3O4 and Pt CEs.36 The corresponding electrochemical measurements are shown in the ESI (Fig. S3–S5†). Finally, the stability of the Fe3O4 CE was tested in an I3−/I− system by CV. There was no clear decline in current density and no peak shift after 100 cycles, which indicates the good stability of the developed Fe3O4 CE10 (Fig. S6†).

Conclusions
In conclusion, the heterogeneous flower-like α-Fe2O3, Fe3O4 and γ-Fe2O3 hierarchical structures were successfully synthesized and introduced into DSCs as counter electrodes. The electrochemical measurements showed that Fe3O4 exhibited excellent performance, and was superior to the other two iron oxides examined. Enhancing the packing density of the nanosheets yielded Fe3O4 flowers with an increased density of reactive sites. Finally, DSCs based on Fe3O4 counter electrodes achieved a notable power conversion efficiency, which was superior to the value obtained for pyrolytic Pt and close to that for sputtered Pt. Our findings in this work suggested that the Fe3O4 could be used as a good candidate counter electrode material for DSCs.
