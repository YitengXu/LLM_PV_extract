    , Accepted 26th May 2017First published on 26th May 2017AbstractDense, homogeneous CuBi2O4 thin films are prepared, for the first time, by spray pyrolysis. Major challenges related to the chemical stability of the precursor solution and spreading behavior of the sprayed droplets are revealed and addressed. Triethyl orthoformate (TEOF) is added as a water scavenger to avoid fast hydrolysis and polycondensation of bismuth ions in the precursor solution, thereby reducing powder formation during the spray deposition process. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) is used to improve the spreading behavior of sprayed droplets over the entire CuBi2O4 film surface, which prevents powder formation completely and allows for the deposition of dense, homogeneous films with thicknesses over 420 nm. These highly uniform CuBi2O4 thin films are well-suited for fundamental studies on the optical and photoelectrochemical properties. Additionally, they produce record photocurrent densities for CuBi2O4 up to 2.0 mA cm−2 under AM1.5 simulated sunlight along with incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) and absorbed photon-to-current efficiency (APCE) values up to 14% and 23%, respectively (for 550 nm light at 0.6 VRHE with H2O2 as an electron scavenger).
Introduction
CuBi2O4, a p-type metal oxide semiconductor, has recently attracted attention as a photocathode material for water splitting due to its suitable bandgap of 1.5–1.8 eV and its exceptionally positive photocurrent onset potential near +1 V vs. RHE.1,2 Under AM1.5 illumination the maximal theoretical photocurrent density is 19.7–29.0 mA cm−2, assuming all photons with energies higher than the bandgap are absorbed and utilized with 100% efficiency.3 However, the experimental photocurrent densities reported so far have been well below this theoretical limit.1,2,4,5 Possible reasons include relatively poor charge carrier transport within the bulk material, which is a common challenge for metal oxide photoelectrodes, surface defects or states resulting in excessive recombination of photo-generated carriers at the surface, and sluggish reaction kinetics for the proton reduction reaction.6 Attempts have been made to pinpoint the main performance limiting factors, but in-depth analysis has been made difficult since all the reported CuBi2O4 films showed a highly porous and irregular structure2,5,7 and/or incomplete substrate coverage.4 Such irregular structures usually result in a high amount of optical scattering, which presents additional challenges and complications for the implementation of multiple photoelectrodes in a tandem cell configuration.8 Therefore, new deposition techniques that produce dense, homogeneous CuBi2O4 thin films are needed to unravel the basic material properties so that the performance limiting factors can be thoroughly quantified. Each problem can then be systematically addressed to improve the photocurrent density towards the theoretical limit, as was successfully done for other metal oxide photoelectrodes like BiVO4 (ref. 9–11) and Cu2O.12,13
In this work we report, for the first time, the synthesis of high quality, dense, and homogeneous CuBi2O4 thin film photocathodes by spray pyrolysis. To accomplish this, precursor solutions containing Cu2+ and Bi3+ ions were mixed with various additives to prevent undesired side reactions and insufficient film adherence during the spray pyrolysis process. The chemical composition and stability of the precursor solutions were analyzed in detail using infrared spectroscopy and the resulting CuBi2O4 thin films were characterized using optical and photoelectrochemical measurements. The dense, homogenous CuBi2O4 thin film photocathodes synthesized using the optimized spray pyrolysis recipe set a new benchmark AM1.5 photocurrent density for CuBi2O4 of 2.0 mA cm−2 at 0.6 VRHE with H2O2 as an electron scavenger.
Results and discussion
Optimization of spray pyrolysis recipe for CuBi2O4 photocathodes
In this study, the spray pyrolysis precursor solution was prepared by dissolving Bi(NO3)3·5H2O in acetic acid and mixing it with Cu(NO3)2·3H2O in ethanol to a Cu(NO3)2·3H2O:Bi(NO3)3·5H2O molar ratio of 1:2 in order to match the stoichiometry of CuBi2O4. The combination of Cu2+ and Bi3+ ions, H2O, acetic acid, and ethanol resulted in major challenges related to the stability of the solution and spreading behavior of droplets during spray pyrolysis. To overcome these challenges small amounts of triethyl orthoformate (TEOF) and polyethylene glycol (PEG) were added. In this section we discuss the chemistry of the precursor solution and the resulting morphology of the CuBi2O4 thin films prepared under the following conditions: (1) without additives, (2) with TEOF, and (3) with TEOF and PEG.
First we investigate CuBi2O4 thin films prepared without any additives. CuBi2O4 precursor solution concentrations of 2, 10, and 20 mM (i.e. 20 mM Cu(NO3)2·3H2O and 40 mM Bi(NO3)3·5H2O) were prepared with an acetic acid:ethanol ratio of 1:9. The spray volume was adjusted for each concentration so that a constant mol amount of Cu2+ and Bi3+ was sprayed. SEM images comparing CuBi2O4 films produced from these three concentrations are included in Fig. S1 in the ESI.† The film produced using a 20 mM precursor concentration shows the most homogenous distribution of CuBi2O4 crystallites on the surface. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was used to confirm that all of the CuBi2O4 thin films prepared in this study are crystalline (see Fig. S2†). The X-ray diffractogram for the prepared film (labeled as “without additives”) matches very well with the reference pattern for tetragonal CuBi2O4 (PDF# 00-042-0334, kusachiite, tetragonal crystal structure, space group P4/ncc).
A photograph and cross section SEM images of this CuBi2O4 film are shown in Fig. 1. The thickness of the film is estimated to be ∼50 nm. Although the CuBi2O4 thin film deposited in the center of the substrate was fairly homogeneous (Fig. 1a), at the edges of the substrate the film surface was covered with large particulate agglomerations on the order of 1–3 μm in diameter (Fig. 1b). As shown in the photograph, these agglomerates on the edges of the substrate are rough and opaque in appearance (powder-like). Attempts to synthesize CuBi2O4 films thicker than 50 nm by spraying more than 28 mL were hampered by powder formation both at the edges and in the center of the substrate accompanied by cracking and flaking of the top layer.
 Fig. 1  Photograph and cross section SEM images of a ∼50 nm CuBi2O4 thin film synthesized on an FTO substrate by spraying 28 mL of 20 mM precursor solution without additives (a) in the center of the substrate and (b) at the edge of the substrate. The substrate temperature was 450 °C. 
Since the amount of powder on the film surface increased with increasing spray volume, and hence total spray time, it was suspected that the powder formation was caused by chemical changes in the precursor solution over time. When the 20 mM precursor solution was first prepared it was highly transparent, but within 3.5 h it turned opaque and solid precipitates became visible (see Fig. S3†). XRD measurements on the dried and annealed precipitate (500 °C in air for 2 h) revealed a diffractogram that matches closely to the reference pattern for Bi2O3 (PDF # 01-071-0465), as shown in Fig. S4.† This result indicates that hydrolysis, polycondensation, and precipitation predominantly affect the bismuth ions while copper ions remain in the supernatant solution. It has been demonstrated that Bi3+ ions can be easily hydrolyzed in the presence of water according to the following reaction,14 BinOn−1(n+2)+ + H2O + Bi3+ → Bin+1On(n+3)+ + 2H+(1)
Since the precursor solution contains a significant amount of water from Bi(NO3)3·5H2O and Cu(NO3)2·3H2O, the above reaction likely occurs.
To confirm this, a detailed in situ attenuated total reflection infrared (ATR-IR) study was carried out. As reference, the various solvents and additives were measured individually (water, acetic acid, ethanol, TEOF, PEG) as well as the most likely reaction product from the esterification of ethanol and acetic acid (ethyl acetate) and the precipitate formed by hydrolysis of Bi3+. The ATR-IR spectra for these chemicals are included in the ESI (Fig. S5 and S6†). Since our goal was to observe the chemical changes taking place in the solution, we were especially interested in the vibrational modes of the bismuth-containing precipitate. The precipitate showed a strong IR band at 1301 cm−1. This can be assigned to a nitrate vibration and indicates the presence of bismuth oxynitrate.15 A decrease in transmittance around 1301 cm−1 was therefore used as an indication of precursor instability. Fig. 2a shows a color plot of the relative change in transmittance (ΔT) vs. wavenumber and time for the precursor solution without additives. No noticeable change in the transmittance was observed for the first 3 h, but between 3 h and 4 h, there was an abrupt decrease in transmittance at 1301 cm−1, suggesting that bismuth oxynitrate began to settle near the ATR-IR window. This is in agreement with the visual observations of the precursor solution (Fig. S3†).
 Fig. 2  Relative change in transmittance (ΔT) for the 20 mM CuBi2O4 precursor in 1:9 acetic acid:ethanol (a) without additives; (b) with 5% TEOF; (c) with 5% TEOF and 1% PEG. Transmittance was extracted from Fig. S7–S9† and divided by the reference spectrum (measured at 0 h) to obtain the relative changes in the optical transmittance (ΔT) as a function of time and the wavenumber. 
Although we did not observe a change in IR transmittance during the first 3 h, it is likely that precipitation begins much sooner than 3 h. During initial precipitation, however, the particle size is likely too small to be detected visually or by ATR-IR.16 For small particles the intensity of the nitrate vibration of bismuth oxynitrate at 1301 cm−1 can be very weak due to the long wavelength and short penetration depth of the IR light into the solution.
Another possible explanation of the observed change in IR transmittance is the esterification reaction of our solvents. Acetic acid and ethanol may react according to the following reaction: CH3COOH + CH3CH2OH → CH3COOCH2CH3 + H2O(2)
However, no signal is found for ethyl acetate at 1745 cm−1 (CO) or 1240 cm−1 (C–O)17 (see Fig. S5† for IR reference spectra of various solvents). This is further confirmed by a 24 h ATR-IR measurement of solution containing only 1:9 acetic acid:ethanol, in which no ethyl acetate signal was observed (Fig. S10†). This is likely due to very slow kinetics for the esterification reaction (reaction (2)) without the presence of a catalyst.18 Alternatively, the equilibrium of reaction (2) may lie too far to the left to observe the ethyl acetate, due to the water already present in precursor solution from the hydrate salts.
The XRD results for the precipitate combined with the detailed ATR-IR analysis of the precursor solution provide strong evidence that the rapid precipitation of the solution is due to the hydrolysis of Bi3+ ions. We therefore added TEOF, a well-known efficient water scavenger,19 to the precursor solution with the aim to remove water and slow down the hydrolysis of Bi3+. TEOF reacts with water to form ethyl formate and ethanol via the following reaction, CH(OC2H5)3 + H2O → HCOOCH2CH3 + 2CH3CH2OH(3)
According to the stoichiometry of this reaction, 4.9% (by volume) TEOF is required to consume all of the initial water from the precursor solution (from 20 mM Cu(NO3)2·3H2O and 40 mM Bi(NO3)3·5H2O in acetic acid and ethanol). We therefore added ∼5% TEOF into our precursor solution and monitored the stability via the Bi-oxynitrate signal at 1301 cm−1 in the ATR-IR spectra (Fig. 2b). The TEOF clearly slows down the hydrolysis of Bi3+, and extends the stability of the solution from ∼3 h to more than 9 h. This allows a much larger volume of solution to be sprayed before powder formation starts, enabling the growth of thicker CuBi2O4 films while preventing the formation of large agglomerates.
The optimal TEOF concentration of 5% was confirmed by surface roughness measurements on a series of films made from precursor solutions with 0%, 1%, 5%, and 10% TEOF. CuBi2O4 thin films synthesized with 5% TEOF showed the lowest root mean squared (RMS) roughness (34.5 nm) as measured by AFM (Fig. 3). This is consistent with the UV-vis measurements in Fig. S11,† which show the highest direct reflectance and smallest diffuse reflectance for the 5% TEOF films.

Fig. 4 shows photographs and cross section SEM images of CuBi2O4 films with thicknesses of ∼50 and ∼70 nm produced by spraying 28 and 40 mL of precursor solution, respectively. As shown in Fig. 4a, the 5% TEOF present in this solution allowed the deposition of 50 nm CuBi2O4 thin films that were homogenous and dense over the entire substrate area. Recall that without additives 50 nm films had particulate agglomerations at the edges of the substrate due to the instability of the solution (Fig. 1b). Nevertheless, even with 5% TEOF, particle agglomeration and powder formation does occur on the edges of the ∼70 nm thick films, as revealed in Fig. 4b and c.

(a) ∼50 nm thick homogeneous film, (b) ∼70 nm thick film in the center of the substrate, and (c) 70 nm thick film at the edge of the substrate. The 50 and 70 nm films were produced by spraying 28 and 40 mL of precursor solution, respectively. The substrate temperature of 450 °C was chosen because it resulted in the most homogeneous CuBi2O4 thin films without deforming the FTO substrate. See Fig. S12† for photographs of CuBi2O4 thin films deposited at substrate temperatures of 350, 400, 450, and 500 °C. 
Since spray deposition of a 70 nm thick film took ∼30 minutes and the addition of 5% TEOF extends the precursor stability to well over 9 h, other factors must contribute to the formation of agglomerates. One possible factor is a change in the spreading behavior of sprayed droplets as the CuBi2O4 films grow thicker. Similar powder formation has been observed during the spray pyrolysis of other materials (e.g. yttrium-stabilized zirconia) and one solution to this problem was the addition of modest amounts of polyethylene glycol (PEG).20,21 Much larger concentrations are sometimes also used (up to 100% ethylene glycol/PEG mixtures), but the resulting metal oxide layers are often nanostructured or highly porous.6,22,23 Therefore, we tried adding a relatively small amount of PEG (1% by volume) in addition to TEOF in an attempt to improve the spreading behavior of the sprayed droplets over the film surface and prevent powder formation. The ATR-IR data shown in Fig. 2c reveal that the addition of 1% PEG to the 5% TEOF solution further increases the stability of the precursor solution from 9 h to 12 h.
CuBi2O4 films with approximate thicknesses of 50, 70, and 270 nm were prepared by spraying 100, 130 and 400 mL of a precursor solution containing 5% TEOF and 1% PEG. Note that the addition of only 1% of PEG results in a more than 3 times larger volume of precursor solution needed to reach the same film thickness as a solution without PEG. Fig. 5 shows photographs and SEM images of the films. All three films showed high homogeneity across the entire substrate without any large agglomerates. Using the same solution, agglomerate-free CuBi2O4 thin films with a thickness of more than 420 nm can even be synthesized, as shown in Fig. S13.† The XRD measurements confirm that these films are again highly crystalline with a close match to the reference pattern for tetragonal CuBi2O4 (Fig. S2†). Scherrer analysis of the XRD patterns indicates an average crystallite size of 37 nm (Fig. S14†).

Several explanations can be given for the improved film quality upon addition of PEG. Adding small percentages of ethylene glycol or PEG to ethanol is known to increase the solution density, viscosity, and boiling point, while decreasing the surface tension.24,25 This may allow the sprayed droplets to spread more uniformly across the surface of the CuBi2O4 films during the pyrolysis process. The influence of PEG on spray pyrolysis has also been explained in terms of the binding properties of the polymer. PEG can entwist throughout the sprayed drops leading to the formation of a dense network of PEG chains, which can help forming dense and compact films.20,21 The parameters of the optimized recipe for the preparation of dense and homogeneous CuBi2O4 films are summarized in Table 1.

Optical absorption properties of the CuBi2O4 thin films synthesized by spray pyrolysis
Now that dense, homogenous CuBi2O4 thin films can be deposited, we analyzed the optical absorption properties. For this, the optimized spray parameters listed in Table 1 were used to deposit a series of films with different thicknesses on quartz substrates. The thickness values are 110, 270, and 420 nm, as estimated by SEM cross sections (Fig. S13†). The transflectance of these films was measured inside an integrating sphere to determine the true absorptance (absorptance = 1 − transflectance). Fig. 6a shows the absorptance spectra. All three films with different thicknesses show an onset in absorptance near 850 nm. The 270 and 420 nm films show a steep initial increase in absorptance followed by leveling off at wavelengths shorter than 610 nm, while the 110 nm film shows a gradual and linear increase in absorption without a plateau. This is because the 110 nm CuBi2O4 thin film is too thin for complete absorption. Fig. 6b shows the absorption coefficient (α), which was calculated from the transflectance and film thicknesses as explained in the Experimental section. The close overlapping of the absorption coefficient spectra for different film thicknesses suggests that the calculated absorption coefficient, an intrinsic property of the material itself, is indeed accurate. An average absorption coefficient of 3.57 × 104 cm−1 at a wavelength of 550 nm is found, which translates to a penetration depth of α−1 = 280 nm. This value is very close to the value that was previously reported for highly nanoporous CuBi2O4 photoelectrodes, in which α was calculated from the absorptance and the effective thickness (based on the amount of material and assuming a fully dense film).2 This is a strong indication that the CuBi2O4 films synthesized by spray pyrolysis are indeed dense and compact.
 Fig. 6  (a) Absorptance spectra for CuBi2O4 films deposited on quartz substrates with estimated thicknesses of 110, 270, and 420 nm as determined by SEM cross sections of thin films deposited on FTO (b) absorption coefficient for CuBi2O4 films with different thicknesses. Both plots were derived from transflectance measurements. 
To extract the bandgap of CuBi2O4, Tauc plots were constructed from the absorption coefficient (Fig. S15†). However, this commonly applied methodology is not effective for CuBi2O4 films because neither the direct nor indirect Tauc plot shows a steep, linear section that would allow for extrapolation to a bandgap value. Similar difficulty in deriving the bandgap from Tauc plots has been encountered for other metal oxide semiconductors.26–28 Nevertheless, the direct bandgap Tauc plot for the CuBi2O4 thin films approaches (αhv)2 = 0 near hv ≈ 1.50 eV and the indirect Tauc plot shows an inflection in (αhv)1/2 around hv ≈ 1.41 eV. The absorption onset of 850 nm from Fig. 6a corresponds to an energy of 1.46 eV. This places the bandgap of CuBi2O4 synthesized by spray pyrolysis in the range of 1.41–1.50 eV, which is at the low end of previously reported values (1.5–1.8 eV).1,2,28–30 An early absorption onset can correspond to the defects in the structure31 or surface states.32
Electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and Mott–Schottky plots are shown in Fig. S16 and S17,† respectively. From the extrapolated x-axis intercept, the flat band potential (φfb) of the sprayed CuBi2O4 films is estimated to be at about 1.21 V vs. RHE and the acceptor density (NA) was calculated to be about 3.7 × 1018 cm−3 from the slope. Assuming that CuBi2O4 has an effective density of states of 5 × 1019 cm−3, this places the Fermi lever (EF) less than 0.08 V away from the valence band edge.33 The valence band and conduction band edges are therefore estimated to be located at −0.17 and 1.29 VRHE, respectively.
The absorptance spectrum (for the 270 nm CuBi2O4 film) was integrated over the AM1.5 solar spectrum for all wavelengths below 850 nm resulting in an estimated absorbed maximum photocurrent density (Jabs,max) of 15.1 mA cm−2. This value is significantly lower than the maximum theoretical photocurrent density of 30.5 mA cm−2 (for 100% absorption of light below 850 nm), but it is still relatively high compared to the current state of the art metal oxide photoelectrodes.6
Photoelectrochemical properties of CuBi2O4 photocathodes synthesized by spray pyrolysis
To assess the photoelectrochemical performance of the dense, homogeneous CuBi2O4 films we deposited several films on FTO substrates. Fig. 7 shows a chopped linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) scan for a 270 nm thick CuBi2O4 photocathode prepared using the optimized spray pyrolysis recipe from Table 1. The LSV scans were performed with AM1.5 illumination from the front (electrolyte–CuBi2O4 side) and back (FTO substrate side). With argon bubbling the photocurrent density is relatively low at less than 0.3 mA cm−2 at 0.6 VRHE for both front and back illumination. To test the CuBi2O4 photocathodes without limitations in the reaction kinetics for proton reduction, H2O2 was added to the electrolyte as an electron scavenger. With a redox potential of 0.815 VRHE,2 the H2O2 reduction reaction should be much more facile than proton reduction (0.0 VRHE). With H2O2 added to the electrolyte the CuBi2O4 photocathode shows a clear photocurrent onset at ∼1.0 VRHE and reaches a photocurrent density of 2.0 mA cm−2 at 0.6 VRHE under back illumination, which is the highest value thus far reported for this material.2,5,34,35 This dramatic increase in photocurrent density in the presence of H2O2 suggests that bare CuBi2O4 is severely limited by poor hydrogen evolution kinetics.
 Fig. 7  Chopped (light/dark) linear sweep voltammetry scans for ∼270 nm CuBi2O4 (sprayed using 20 mM precursor solution with 5% TEOF and 1% PEG on FTO at 450 °C) performed in 0.3 M K2SO4 and 0.2 M phosphate buffer (pH 6.65) with Ar bubbling and with H2O2 (no Ar bubbling) under front and back AM1.5 illumination. 
It should be noted that the addition of H2O2 into the electrolyte may lead to current-doubling.34,35 In this case, however, the increase in photocurrent density is nearly 8-fold so even if current-doubling occurs the increase due to overcoming reaction kinetics is at least 4-fold.
At potentials more negative than 0.5 VRHE the photocathodes begin to show significant dark current due to the electrochemical reduction of H2O2, non-ideal semiconductor behavior, and the exposure of FTO to the electrolyte. With argon bubbling, in the absence of H2O2, the CuBi2O4 photocathodes show the dark current starting at potentials negative of 0.4 VRHE, which can be attributed to the onset of the electrochemical reduction of Cu2+ in CuBi2O4 (for CuO in pH 7 solution the Cu2+/Cu+ redox potential has been reported at ∼0.6 VRHE).23 Fig. S18† shows dark LSV scans for CuO and CuBi2O4 films extended to more negative potentials. The cathodic dark current increases dramatically at potentials negative of 0.42 and 0.22 VRHE for CuO and CuBi2O4, respectively. Although the shapes of the chopped LSV curves for CuBi2O4 suggest that higher photocurrents may be possible by increasing the amount of band bending, the dark current prevents us from scanning the potential more negative than 0.4 VRHE.
To make a fair comparison with previous reports on other CuBi2O4 photoelectrodes, we also performed the PEC measurements in 0.1 M KOH with O2 as an electron scavenger, as shown in Fig. S19.† At 0.6 VRHE, our dense and compact CuBi2O4 photocathode produces a photocurrent density of ∼1.6 mA cm−2 under AM1.5 solar simulation, which is twice as high as a previously reported value (∼0.8 mA cm−2) for a highly porous CuBi2O4 photocathode tested under similar conditions.5 Despite this, the photocurrent is ∼20% lower than the photocurrent in the presence of H2O2. In contrast to the chopped LSV scans with H2O2, the chopped LSV scans with O2 bubbling show a transient decrease in the cathodic photocurrent when turning on the light, and these transients become more pronounced at more negative potentials. We attribute this to the low concentration of dissolved O2. This results in mass transport limitations, as confirmed by the cathodic current plateau (Fig. S20†) and transient peaks observed for O2 reduction at a Pt wire electrode in the same electrolyte (Fig. S21†).
To test the stability of the CuBi2O4 photocathodes, the photocurrent density was measured with Ar bubbling and with H2O2 at a constant potential of 0.6 V vs. RHE for several hours under chopped illumination, as shown in Fig. S22.† With Ar bubbling, the photocurrent density decreases by 80% within 15 min due to photo-corrosion and poor kinetics towards the proton reduction reaction. In contrast, when H2O2 is present, CuBi2O4 can transfer photo-generated electrons into the electrolyte much more efficiently. As a result, the photocurrent decreases by only 24% within 180 min. This suggests that the stability of CuBi2O4 can be much improved by applying suitable co-catalysts for proton reduction, thereby providing a kinetically favored alternative pathway for the photogenerated electrons.
The quantum efficiency of the CuBi2O4 photocathode was determined using incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) and absorbed photon-to-current efficiency (APCE) measurements. Fig. 8 shows the IPCE spectra under back illumination along with the upper limit for IPCE based on the absorptance of the CuBi2O4 film (taken from Fig. 6). For 550 nm light at 0.6 VRHE, the 270 nm CuBi2O4 film produces IPCE and APCE values of 14.0% and 23.1%, respectively. These values represent a new record for CuBi2O4 at such a positive potential.2,4,5,36
 Fig. 8  IPCE spectra for ∼270 nm CuBi2O4 films (sprayed using 20 mM precursor solution with 5% TEOF and 1% PEG on FTO at 450 °C). The measurements were performed at a potential of 0.6 V vs. RHE in a solution of 0.3 M K2SO4 and 0.2 M phosphate buffer (pH 6.65) with H2O2 under back illumination. The black line represents the maximum obtainable IPCE values for these photocathodes based on the absorption spectra (Fig. 6). 
In general the IPCE values are well below the upper absorptance limit for CuBi2O4 and the APCE values are below 60% for all wavelengths, even with the addition of H2O2 as an electron scavenger. Assuming that the injection efficiency in the presence of H2O2 is 100% at the CuBi2O4–electrolyte interface, then the low IPCE and APCE values indicate that the photo-conversion efficiency of CuBi2O4 is largely limited by bulk recombination. The APCE value reflects the charge separation efficiency; the low values therefore indicate that a significant fraction of the photo-generated electrons recombine before reaching the CuBi2O4–electrolyte interface.
Nevertheless, these sprayed CuBi2O4 thin films show considerably higher IPCE values than that were previously reported for CuBi2O4 photocathodes synthesized by drop-casting.2 We attribute this improvement to the densely packed, high quality CuBi2O4 crystallites obtained by pyrolysis of the precursors during spray pyrolysis as opposed to the sparse, elongated particles obtained by other methods.2,4
The predicted AM1.5 photocurrent density (JAM1.5) of the photocathodes can be estimated by multiplying the IPCE values by the transmittance of the FTO substrate and the AM1.5 solar photon flux and subsequently integrating this for wavelengths below 850 nm according to the following relationship, (4)where JAM1.5 is the total solar photocurrent in A m−2, ΦAM1.5(λ) is the photon flux of sunlight in photons per m2 per s, λ is the light wavelength, and e is the electronic charge. This results in a predicted photocurrent density of 2.2 mA cm−2 at 0.6 VRHE, which is very close to the 2.0 mA cm−2 obtained for the chopped LSV measurements under AM1.5 solar simulation.
Conclusions
For the first time, we have developed a spray pyrolysis recipe to prepare dense, homogeneous CuBi2O4 photocathodes, which show a low degree of optical scattering and therefore are suitable for tandem configurations. In addition, our well-defined films are well-suited for identifying the photophysical and photoelectrochemical properties. To optimize the recipe, significant challenges in the spray pyrolysis process were identified and addressed. The challenge of rapid precipitation in the precursor solution was confirmed to be caused by the hydrolysis of Bi3+ in the presence of water. Adding 5% TEOF effectively slows the hydrolysis of Bi3+ by scavenging the water and thus significantly increases the stability of the precursor solution and reduces powder formation on the CuBi2O4 surface. The addition of 1% PEG to the precursor solution remarkably improves the spreading behavior of the droplets over the entire CuBi2O4 film surface and therefore prevents powder formation completely resulting in highly uniform CuBi2O4 thin films over 420 nm thick. While this study focuses on CuBi2O4, the methods used for improving the precursor solution stability and controlling the spreading behavior of sprayed droplets can easily be applied to the spray pyrolysis of other metal oxides.
Optical absorption and photoelectrochemical measurements were performed on the dense, homogeneous CuBi2O4 thin films prepared using the optimized spray pyrolysis recipe. The optical behavior is consistent with previous reports on CuBi2O4 while the photoelectrochemical performance of the CuBi2O4 photocathodes sets a new benchmark for this material with photocurrent densities as high as 2.0 mA cm−2 along with IPCE and APCE values of 14.0% and 23.1%, respectively for 550 nm light (at 0.6 VRHE with H2O2 as an electron scavenger). In the future these high quality, well-defined CuBi2O4 thin films can be used for more in-depth fundamental studies to further quantify the performance limiting factors of CuBi2O4 as a photocathode material.
Experimental
Material synthesis
CuBi2O4 films were prepared by spray pyrolysis, as illustrated in the schematic (Fig. 9). A CuBi2O4 precursor solution was prepared by dissolving Bi(NO3)3·5H2O (98%, Alfa Aesar) in acetic acid (≥99.8%, Sigma Aldrich) and Cu(NO3)2·3H2O (99–104%, Sigma-Aldrich) in absolute ethanol (≥99.8%, Sigma Aldrich). The Bi solution was then added to the Cu solution, and the mixture was diluted to the desired concentration with additional ethanol. For the preparation of solutions with additives, certain amounts of TEOF and PEG (average Mn = 300) were added to ethanol before mixing in the precursor salts. The substrates were fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glass (7 Ω sq−1, Nippon Sheet Glass Co. Ltd.) and quartz (H Baumbach & Co. Ltd) for the optical absorption measurements. Prior to deposition, the substrates were cleaned by three successive 15 min ultrasonic rinsing steps in 1 vol% Triton, acetone, and ethanol, followed by drying under a stream of compressed nitrogen. Before deposition was started the substrates were placed on the hot plate and heated to the preset temperature. The spray nozzle (Quickmist Air Atomizing Spray) was placed 20 cm above the heating plate and driven by an overpressure of 0.6 bar of nitrogen gas. A pulsed deposition mode was used, with one spray cycle consisting of 5 s spray time followed by a delay of 55 s to allow complete evaporation of the solvent and (or) pyrolysis of remaining organics.

Material characterization
The morphology and the elemental composition of the films were analyzed using a LEO GEMINI 1530 field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM), operated with an acceleration voltage of 5 kV. Glancing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) measurements were carried out using a Bruker AXS D8-Advance X-ray diffractometer with a Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.154 nm). The angle of incidence was fixed at 0.3° while the detection angle 2θ was varied from 15° to 60°. The crystallite size was estimated from the calibrated Scherrer equation as follow, (5)where L is the crystallite size in nm, K is the shape factor constant taken as 0.89, λ is the wavelength of the Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.154 nm). The measured broadening (kmeasured) and instrumental broadening (kinstrumental) were calculated from the following relationship, (6) (7)
Here, βmeasured is the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the diffraction peaks extracted from the XRD pattern of CuBi2O4 (Fig. S2†). βinstrumental is determined by measuring the LaB6 reference material from which the instrumental broadening kinstrumental is estimated to be 0.0031.
The surface morphology was investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM, Park System, XE-100) operated in tapping mode using an etched Si tip with a tip radius of 10 nm and a force constant of 40 N m−1. All scans were performed on a scale of 3 μm × 3 μm with the lateral resolved height information on a square array of 256 × 256 pixels.
The transflectance (T + R) and direct reflectance (Rdirect) spectra of the CuBi2O4 films were measured by a UV/Vis spectrometer (Perkin-Elmer Lambda 950) with an integrating sphere, as illustrated in Fig. S23.† The diffuse reflectance (Rdiffuse) was measured with the reflector off while the direct reflectance + diffuse reflectance (Rdirect+diffuse) was measured with the reflector on. The direct reflectance (Rdirect) was calculated with the following formula, Rdirect = Rdirect+diffuse − Rdiffuse(8)
The absorption coefficient was calculated using the following formula, (9)where d is the film thickness.
Precursor solution characterization
The solution chemistry and reaction mechanism were investigated using an IR spectrometer (EQUINOX 55, Bruker). A self-designed capturing technique combined with attenuated total reflection (ATR) was used to prevent the evaporation of the solvents during the measurements. A background measurement was taken before each measurement. For the stability test, each solution was measured every hour for up to 23 h. The measured transmission spectra were divided by the reference spectrum (measured at 0 h) to obtain the relative changes in the optical transmittance (ΔT) as a function of time and the wavenumber.
Electrochemical and photoelectrochemical measurements
The photoelectrochemical measurements were performed using an EG & G Princeton Applied Research 273 A potentiostat in a three-electrode configuration, with the CuBi2O4 film as the working electrode, an Ag/AgCl (saturated KCl) reference electrode, and a platinum wire counter electrode in a quartz-windowed PEC cell. A WACOM Class AAA solar simulator (WXS-50S-5H) was used as an illumination source (AM1.5, 100 mW cm−2). The electrolyte was 0.3 M K2SO4 and 0.2 M phosphate buffer (pH 6.65). The pH value was checked with a pH meter (OAKTON). Argon gas was bubbled into the electrolyte to purge dissolved oxygen so that the CuBi2O4 photocathodes could be tested for activity towards proton reduction rather than oxygen reduction.2,5,35,37 All potentials were converted to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) scale using the Nernstian relation, VRHE = VAg/AgCl + 0.0591 × pH + 0.197 (V)(10)
Monochromatic photocurrents were measured with a 300 W quartz Xenon lamp coupled into a grating monochromator (Acton SpectraPro 150 i). An electronic shutter (Uniblitz LS6) was used, and a long-pass colored glass filter (Schott, 3 mm thick) was placed between the monochromator and the sample to remove second-order diffracted light. The shutter was actuated every 10 seconds, and the currents were determined first waiting for 8 s, following by averaging the measured values for 2 s before the shutter was actuated again. A dark and light measurement was taken for each datapoint, with 1.5 nm wavelength steps between each point.
IPCE was calculated from the following formula, (11)where Jpho is the photocurrent (Fig. S24†), P is the power (Fig. S25†), and λ is the wavelength. The APCE was calculated from the following formula, (12)where A is the absorptance. The IPCE of the CuBi2O4 photocathodes were measured at 0.6 VRHE with H2O2 added as an electron scavenger.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and Mott–Schottky measurements were performed using a VersaSTAT 3 Potentiostat (AMETEK Co., Ltd.). Mott–Schottky plots were created based on the following formula,38 (13)where C is the capacitance, ε is the relative permittivity, ε0 is the permittivity of free space, NA is the acceptor density, φfb is the flat band potential. AFM was used to estimate the real surface area from the geometric surface area of the working electrode in the PEC cell (i.e., our CuBi2O4 photocathode) (see Fig. S26†).
