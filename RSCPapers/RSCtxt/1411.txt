    , Accepted 26th September 2022First published on 27th September 2022AbstractDeposition of a large-area metal halide perovskite (MHP) film for perovskite solar cells (PSCs) under ambient conditions is highly required for their commercial applications. In this study, we fabricate mixed-cation and mixed-halide perovskite films by doctor-blade coating with a nontoxic solvent system under ambient conditions (a relative humidity of 40–45%). A crystallization controlling agent 18-crown-6 (18C6) is further added to the multiple-component MHP to improve the film quality. Liquid-phase scanning electron microscopy (L-SEM) is conducted to investigate the effects of 18C6 on the MHP precursor and the doctor-bladed MHP film. The L-SEM image of the pristine MHP precursor reveals self-assembly of micelles, while the addition of 18C6 effectively suppresses the size of the MHP-based micelles in the MHP precursor. Strong coordination between 18C6 and metal cations (such as Cs+ and Pb2+) prevents the MHP-based micelles from segregation, reducing the micellar size from the μm level (without 18C6) to the sub-μm level (with 18C6). This effect could result in uniform-sized micelles in the precursor and a reduced crystal growth rate to achieve a high-quality MHP film with preferred crystallinity, an enhanced MHP domain size, and a smooth surface. The agent 18C6 in PSCs significantly improves the power conversion efficiency (PCE) from 7.8% (without 18C6) to 14.7% (with 18C6).
1. Introduction
Metal halide perovskites (MHPs) applied for solar cells, namely perovskite solar cells (PSCs), have attracted enormous attention due to their boosting power conversion efficiency (PCE), which is certified to be over 25%.1 Various solution processes such as spin coating, gas vapor annealing,2 vapor-assisted solution processing3–6 and gas-assisted solution processing7 are extensively employed for fabrication of high-efficiency PSCs. Although the PSCs prepared by these methods have achieved remarkable efficiency, fabrication of large-area PSCs remains challenging due to the demand for film uniformity. Currently, several approaches, such as spray coating,8–12 slot-die coating,13–17 doctor-blade coating,18–24 air knife coating,25 and inkjet printing,26,27 have been implemented for the scale-up of PSCs. Among these scale-up methods, doctor-blade coating is a simple, versatile, and continuous fabrication process that produces a large-area MHP film with high material utilization. The first work of a MHP film prepared by the blade coating was demonstrated in 2015 and its application in solar cells delivered a PCE of 15%.22 The PCE of blade-coated PSCs was further boosted to over ∼22% by additive engineering and solvent engineering and using an innovative technology.21
The multi-component (mixed cation and mixed halide) MHP-based PSCs delivered better photovoltaic characteristics along with superior long-term stability than their methylammonium lead triiodide (MAPbI3) counterpart.28 More recently, it has been found that the multi-component perovskite based solar cells can survive more than 1800 hours under a damp heat test and operate for over 75 cycles of the humidity-freeze test. These soaking tests for the PSCs have already exceeded the requirements of the IEC61215:2016 standard.29 However, controlling the composition of multi-component MHP films through a doctor blading process is not straightforward. How the complex contents affect the film formation process and influence the MHP film quality is not well understood. For a doctor-bladed multi-component MHP, Yaghoobi et al. proposed a scalable fabrication process of heteroepitaxial growth for a (FA1−x−yMAxCsy)Pb(I1−xBrx)3 MHP by a two-step sequential method, which effectively improves the MHP film quality.30 Although the MHP film prepared by the two-step sequential method can achieve a good film quality, the one-step method for MHP film fabrication is more suitable for mass production from the viewpoint of saving time and ease of process flow.
Solvent engineering and additive engineering are effective strategies to control the crystallization of solution-processed MHP films and the resultant film formation.31,32 Recently, these strategies are further applied in a doctor-bladed perovskite film. Zhang et al. introduced a nonvolatile solvent 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) into the PbI2 precursor to fabricate a (FAPbI3)1−x(MAPbBr3)x MHP via a two-step process. The TBP-assisted MHP film has much less PbI2 residues. Moreover, a strong coordination between TBP and PbI2 effectively stabilizes the α-phase FAPbI3 MHP. This study highlights that the coordination control between PbI2 and the solvent is critical for improving the MHP film quality.23 Wu et al. employed an additive phenylethylammonium chloride (PEACl) in the multi-component MHP to improve the MHP phase purity. Strong binding between the large-sized cation of PEA+ and the MHP produces a moisture-repelling barrier at the MHP domain boundaries and on the MHP film surface, which prevents the moisture penetration and enhances the MHP film stability. The device doped with PEACl retains 96% of its initial PCE after 500 h, while the PSC without PEACl degrades to about 40% of its original PCE after 300 h.24 Although many studies have demonstrated high-quality multi-component MHP films, toxic solvent dimethylformamide (DMF) is extensively employed. This remained a concern for fabrication of PSCs under an ambient atmosphere. An eco-friendly alternative to the toxic solvent is favorable for processing PSCs under ambient conditions. Recently, we introduced an eco-friendly solvent system composed of γ-butyrolactone (GBL), dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), and isopropanol (IPA) for processing MHP films under ambient conditions via doctor blade coating. Adding IPA in the precursor facilitates DMSO evaporation and suppresses the DMSO-MHP impurity phase and trap density in the MHP film. Thermal post-treatment is further conducted to homogenize the solvent evaporation rate on the top of the MHP film, thereby improving the MHP film quality.33
Liquid-phase electron microscopy (L-EM) based on transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning transmission microscopy (STM), or scanning electron microscopy (SEM) has shown its potential to directly visualize the structure of soft or biological matter in liquids with high resolution.34 The dynamic process of soft matter, such as translation and rotational motion, self-assembly mechanisms of synthetic soft matter, and conformational changes in biological macromolecules can be further imaged by virtue of the emerging L-EM technology. Moreover, introducing high atomic-number materials into soft matter or applying metal nanoparticles in biological materials can enhance the image contrast due to their high secondary electron yields. In this work, for the first time, liquid-phase scanning electron microscopy (L-SEM) is used to examine the effect of a crystallization controlling agent, namely 18-crown-6 (abbreviated as 18C6), on the MHP precursor.
Crown ether 18C6 and its derivatives have been introduced into the PSCs and light emitting diodes to improve the MHP film quality in terms of inhibition of the MHP phase transition, improving the MHP precursor stability, surface passivation, and manipulation of the MHP growth process.35–41 Although the addition of crown ether stabilizes the MHP precursor according to density functional theory (DFT) calculations37 and improves the MHP film quality,39 direct evidence for the growth mechanism is not yet provided. The L-SEM images indicate that 18C6 effectively suppresses the size of MHP-based micelles, resulting in homogeneous-sized micelles in the MHP precursor. The uniform-sized MHP micelles after adding 18C6 have a profound influence on the doctor-bladed MHP film, which is prepared using a green solvent system and processed under ambient conditions, with an enhanced MHP domain size, improved film uniformity, and improved solar cell performance. By optimizing the concentration of 18C6 in the MHP precursor, the champion doctor-bladed PSC achieves a PCE of 14.7%.
2. Results and discussion
The MHP precursor is sealed in a liquid cell for the L-SEM measurement as illustrated in Fig. 1a. The effect of 18C6 crown ether on the (FA0.8MA0.15Cs0.05)Pb(I0.85Br0.15)3 MHP precursor is investigated by L-SEM as revealed in Fig. 1b–e. The molecular structure of 18C6 crown ether is illustrated in Fig. S1a (ESI†). Fig. 1b shows the L-SEM image of the MHP precursor made of a green solvent system of GBL/DMSO/IPA without 18C6, in which bright spots with much different sizes from sub-μm to several μm in radius are observed. These bright spots result from a high secondary electron yield under electron beam illumination. The maximum size of the bright spot even reaches 4 μm. The bright spot size is apparently reduced after adding 18C6 to the MHP precursor (refer to Fig. 1c–e). When the concentration of 18C6 increases to 0.95 mM, the maximum size of the bright spot is significantly reduced to around 1 μm as seen in Fig. 1d. Moreover, the MHP precursor with 0.95 mM 18C6 delivers more consistent-sized bright spots compared to that with 0.05 mM 18C6. When the concentration of 18C6 further increases to 1.9 mM, only a few bright spots with a size of less than 1 μm are clearly observed as shown in Fig. 1e.

L-SEM further allows us to map elements in the MHP precursor by detecting their characteristic X-ray spectra that are generated by electron beam excitation. Fig. S1 (ESI†) shows the L-SEM images and the energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) maps of characteristic elements, including Pb, Cs, I, and O, for the MHP precursor with 0.95 mM 18C6. The EDX maps indicate that the bright spots are composed of the lead, iodide, and cesium element clusters. In contrast, the oxygen element is distributed evenly in the precursor, which could be attributed to the solvents DMSO, GBL and IPA. The main constituent elements of MHP are concentrated within the bright spots that are presumably responsible for the MHP micelles due to their size beyond the colloidal range.42,43 The above results imply that 1.06 M (FA0.8MA0.15Cs0.05)Pb(I0.85Br0.15)3 dissolved in the GBL/DMSO/IPA solvent system undergoes micellization due to its concentration over the critical micellization concentration (CMC). The electrostatic interactions between ionic species, including organic cations (FA+, MA+, and Cs+), anions (Br− and I−), and coordinated lead polyhalogeno ([PbX3]−, [PbX4]2−, [PbX5]3−, and [PbX6]4−) presumably render the ionic species aggregation to form micelles. The additive 18C6 in the MHP precursor could reduce the CMC and the Gibbs free energy for micellization. As a result, a high concentration of 18C6 in the MHP precursor facilitates the micellization with a decreased micellar size.44
The (FA0.8MA0.15Cs0.05)Pb(I0.85Br0.15)3 MHP film doped with different concentrations of 18C6 is doctor-bladed onto a substrate at 150 °C with a relatively high blading speed of 30 mm s−1.18–20 Such a blading speed falls in the Landau–Levich region to cause the as-coated film still a wet film after blading.19Fig. 1f–i show the top-view SEM images of doctor-bladed MHP films with 0, 0.05, 0.95, and 1.9 mM 18C6 after annealing. As shown in Fig. 1f, the MHP film without 18C6 exhibits an uneven surface, on which dendrite domains (marked by a yellow dashed line) are closely packed. Our results exhibit a similar surface morphology of the reported MHP film obtained using doctor-blade coating18,19,22 and the MHP films treated with flash infrared annealing.45 The corresponding magnified SEM images of Fig. 1f–i are shown in Fig. 1j–m and indicate that the dendrite domain is composed of a closely packed MHP domain. Owing to rapid thermal annealing at high temperature, the temperature gradient-induced thermal convection results in anisotropic dendrite growth along energetically favorable crystallography directions.45 The MHP film doped with 0.05 mM 18C6 presents a smooth film surface, a larger dendrite domain, a larger MHP domain size and less protrusion, compared to the case without doping 18C6 (refer to Fig. 1g and k). When the concentration of 18C6 reaches 0.95 mM, the MHP film reveals an enhanced dendrite and MHP domain size without crack and protrusion on the top of the film as seen in Fig. 1h and l. Further addition of 1.9 mM 18C6 to the MHP precursor leads to an enhanced dendrite domain but uneven MHP films with a decreased MHP domain size, and debris in the crystal form of nanowires and nanosheets are observed on the MHP film surface (refer to Fig. 1i and m). From the correlation between the MHP-based micelles in the precursor and the resultant MHP film, the MHP film without 18C6 presents a smaller dendrite domain and MHP domain size, compared to those with 0.05, 0.95 and 1.95 mM18C6, which could result from the widely distributed micellar size in the MHP precursor (refer to Fig. 1b). A relatively comparable MHP micellar size causes a homogeneous growth rate of the MHP, giving rise to a smooth MHP film surface with a large MHP domain.46 By optimizing the concentration of 18C6 to 0.95 mM, a uniform MHP film without any MHP nanocrystal residues on the surface is produced.
The preheated MHP precursor at 100 °C is further examined via L-SEM. A lower heating temperature of 100 °C, less than the working temperature of 150 °C, alleviates the solvent evaporation and allows us to seal the preheated MHP precursor in a liquid cell under optical microscopy (OM). As shown in Fig. 2a, the L-SEM image of the heated MHP precursor without 18C6 presents multiple crystals arranged within a domain marked by a red dashed line, whose lateral size is over 30 μm, which is much larger than the micellar size seen in Fig. 1b. The multiple crystals presumably result from the MHP crystal growth from the nuclei within the MHP-based micelle. Fig. 2b shows the L-SEM image of the preheated MHP precursor without 18C6 at another position, which reveals a wide domain of over several tens of micrometers. After the crystals are formed in the micelle, small-sized micelles undergo a mass transport to merge with large-sized micelles and form such a large domain. It should be noted that a dendrite-like crystal marked by a dashed yellow circle is presumably due to a high crystal growth rate. After adding 0.95 mM 18C6 to the MHP precursor, the L-SEM image presents small-sized domains, in which multiple crystals with a much less crystal size are packed (refer to Fig. 2c). In some domains, the crystal feature is even not clearly observed. Fig. 2d presents the L-SEM image of the MHP precursor with 0.95 mM 18C6 examined at another position and shows that 18C6 can significantly reduce the domain size as compared to that without 18C6. Moreover, a small crystal size without the formation of a dendrite-like crystal within the domain suggests a low crystal growth rate in the preheated MHP precursor after adding 18C6. Correlating the L-SEM results with the SEM images in Fig. 1f and h, we find that the MHP precursor without 18C6 has a large domain size after heating (refer to Fig. 2b) but a small dendrite domain size in the top-view SEM image (refer to Fig. 1f). In contrast, the MHP precursor with 18C6 has a small domain size after heating (refer to Fig. 2d) but a large dendrite domain size in the top-view SEM image (refer to Fig. 1h). The difference between the status in the preheated precursor and the final MHP film could correlate with the crystal growth rate within the merged micelles during heating, and the possible mechanism would be discussed later.

The MHP material sources, such as PbI2, PbBr2, CsI, FAI, and MABr, are dissolved in the GBL/DMSO/IPA solvent system to form ionic species. These ionic species self-assemble into a nucleus. According to the classical nucleation theory, the change of free energy ΔG(r) is presented using eqn (1): (1)where r is the nucleus radius, T is the absolute temperature, γCL is the energy of the liquid (L)–crystalline (C) nucleus interface, R is the gas constant and S is the super saturation ratio defined as S = C/CS, with C as the solute concentration and CS as the solubility limit. The change of free energy as a function of the nucleus radius is as shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). When the nucleus radius is smaller than the critical radius , the nuclei dissolve back into the precursor solution, whereas in the case of the nuclei with radii larger than the critical radius , the nuclei start to grow. Based on the L-SEM results shown in Fig. 1, when a higher concentration of 18C6 is added to the MHP precursor, a smaller micellar size is obtained. The smaller micellar size after adding 18C6 to the MHP precursor has higher solubility based on the Gibbs–Thomson effect.47 The results suggest that the solubility limit (CS) in the MHP precursor increases with the concentration of 18C6, resulting in a large ΔG(bulk term). As revealed in Fig. S2 (ESI†), the change of free energy enhances from  (without 18C6) to  (with 18C6), leading to a reduced critical radius .
The relation between the change of free energy and the nucleation rate is shown in eqn (2): (2)where ΔG* is the change of free energy, Rnuc is the nucleation rate, Ns is the number of nucleation position, j is the rate at which molecules adsorbed to the nucleus participate in the nucleation process, and Z is the Zel’dovich factor. Based on eqn (2), the nucleation rate Rnuc is inversely proportional to ΔG*. The higher ΔG* leads to a lower nucleation rate. After adding 18C6 to the MHP precursor, 18C6 interacted with Pb2+ or Cs+ effectively screening the electrostatic interaction between ionic species and inducing a steric effect of the guest–host complex to separate the ionic species.41 These factors could enhance the change of free energy ΔG*; as a result, the nucleation rate is reduced due to an enhanced .
Based on the discussions above, we infer the effect of the micellar size on the final MHP film formation as illustrated in Fig. 3. Initially, in the MHP precursor without 18C6, the MHP ionic species, including the lead polyhalogeno, the A-site cations, and the DMSO-coordinated iodoplumbates, start to nucleate and form a nucleus (refer to Fig. 3a). A high nucleation rate due to a low change of free energy results in a locally large-sized nucleus, and a non-uniform size distribution of nuclei is formed in the precursor system (refer to Fig. 3b). These large-sized nuclei function as micellar growth sites to form MHP-based micelles by the mass transport of a small-sized nucleus to a large-sized nucleus and electrostatic interaction between them.48 Owing to the initially inhomogeneous distribution of nucleus size, the MHP precursor without 18C6 exhibits a wide-distributed micellar size after nucleus aggregation (refer to Fig. 3c). These nuclei in the MHP-based micelles could serve as the crystal growth sites. When the precursor is doctor-bladed onto the substrate, the as-coated film is still a wet film after blading due to a high blading speed of 30 mm s−1 (refer to Fig. 3g). The substrate is preheated at 150 °C that triggers the evaporation of solvent, leading to oversaturation of the MHP precursor for crystallization. The MHP nucleus within the micelles starts to grow (refer to Fig. 3h), and the growth of MHP impinges either an external boundary or another spherulite growing from the neighboring growth site.49 The MHP domain growth will terminate when the MHP domain connects with adjacent domains, accompanied by the coalescence of neighboring MHP domains (refer to Fig. 3i).31 As seen in Fig. 2a and b, the crystal growth rate in the pristine MHP precursor is much rapid than that in the 18C6-doped MHP precursor. A large-sized domain with multiple crystals packed, as seen in Fig. 2b, presumably results from the coalescence of micelles. The doctor-bladed MHP film exhibits a small MHP domain that is included in a small dendrite domain. The results suggest that the crystal growth in the micelle is terminated before the coalescence of micelles and the dendrite domain is formed due to the coalescence of micelles (refer to Fig. 3i). Moreover, the inconsistent micellar size would lead to a wide size distribution of the dendrite domain, and a protrusion between adjacent dendrite domains gives rise to an uneven surface morphology in the resultant MHP film as seen in Fig. 4a and c.

Adding 18C6 to the MHP precursor enhances the change of free energy, leading to a lower nucleation rate and a small-sized nucleus. As a result, uniform-sized nuclei with small nuclei are created in the 18C6-doped MHP precursor (refer to Fig. 3d and e). The micelles after nuclei agglomeration have a relatively consistent size with a small micellar size (refer to Fig. 3f). The electrostatic screening effect and the steric effect due to the coordination between 18C6 and Pb2+ could suppress the aggregation of the ionic species, which reduces the nucleus size and the micellar size simultaneously. Thus, less nuclei are included within the small-sized micelles. For the doctor-blade coated MHP film with 18C6, the MHP crystal grows from the nucleus site in the micelle (refer to Fig. 3j). At the same time, the micelles merge with other micelles due to the thermal convection or surface tension change by the solvent evaporation. Owing to a low crystal growth rate, the crystallization process still proceeds after the micelle aggregation. The small crystals could dissolve in the solution to undergo recrystallization and form a large-sized MHP domain within the merged micelle (refer to Fig. 3k). Eventually, a compact MHP film with a large dendrite domain and a large MHP domain size is produced (refer to Fig. 4b and d). When the concentration of 18C6 is increased to 0.95 mM, much reduction in the nucleation rate could facilitate the formation of a compact MHP film. Similarly, the crystal growth still proceeds after micelle aggregation. Although the dendrite domain size in the 1.9 mM-doped MHP film is larger than that in the 0.95 mM-doped MHP film, the reduced growth rate gives rise to the formation of MHP nanocrystals within the merged micelle, which could not redissolve in the solution during the doctor-blading process. Eventually, the 1.9 mM-doped MHP film exhibits the largest dendrite domain but the smallest MHP domain among the doctor-bladed MHP films with different concentrations of 18C6.
After the MHP film is doctor-bladed in an ambient environment, the relative humidity (40–45%) and the oxygen atmosphere affect the solvent evaporation, rate of crystallization, and the resultant film quality. To alleviate these factors, the doctor-bladed MHP film undergoes a vacuum-heat treatment (VHT) by immediately transferring the doctor-bladed film to a chamber that is evacuated to 1 Torr within 3 second.33 The chamber is placed on a heater that is kept at a constant temperature of 85 °C. As shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†), and the post-treatment effectively improves the device reproducibility.
To realize the effect of the MHP film fabricated from different 18C6 concentrations on the MHP precursor, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) in attenuated total reflection (ATR) mode is implemented. Fig. 5a shows the FTIR spectra of the 18C6 powders and the pristine MHP films made of different 18C6 concentrations. The MHP film presents characteristic peaks at 1352 and 1710 cm−1, which are, respectively, assigned to the C–N bending mode (δ(C–N)) and C–N stretching mode (ν(C–N)) of the FA cation. In all MHP films, four stretching modes of NH3+ between 3270 and 3411 cm−1 are correlated with the organic MA and FA cations. For the MHP film doped with 18C6, a new C–O–C asymmetric stretching mode (vas(C–O–C)) peak at 1149 cm−1 is detected. The new peak is related to the characteristic peak vas(C–O–C) of 18C6.50 The characteristic peak vas(C–O–C) of the 18C6 powder is 1130 cm−1 and the shift of vas(C–O–C) is presumably due to the interaction between 18C6 and Pb2+.40

(b) The XRD patterns of MHP films with different concentrations of 18C6. (c) Thermogravimetric (TGA) analysis of 18C6 powder, DMSO, and MHP powders without and with 0.95 mM 18C6. 
The surface chemical states of MHP films are further investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Fig. S4a (ESI†) reveals the XPS spectra in the O 1s level range of MHP films without and with 0.95 mM 18C6. The MHP film added with 0.95 mM 18C6 exhibits an XPS peak at a binding energy of 533.0 eV, which is ascribed to the O atom of 18C6 crown ether, whereas no feature XPS peak corresponding to the O 1s level is detected for the pristine MHP film. This confirms that crown ether remains on the surface of the doctor-bladed MHP film. As seen in Fig. S4b (ESI†), a low stoichiometric ratio of 0.05 for Cs in the MHP precursor leads to no feature XPS signal in the Cs 3d level range for the pristine MHP film. However, addition of 18C6 to the MHP film shows two subtle XPS signals in the Cs 3d level range with binding energies of 739.0 and 724.8 eV, which are assigned to the Cs 3d3/2 and Cs 3d5/2 levels, respectively. These results suggest the coexistence of Cs+ and 18C6 on the surface of MHP film. In Fig. S4c (ESI†), the XPS spectra in the Pb 4f level range for the pristine MHP film presents two main peaks at 143.4 (Pb 4f5/2) and 138.5 eV (Pb 4f7/2) that correspond to the Pb–I bonding and two satellite peaks at 142.0 and 137.2 eV that result from the presence of metallic Pb. After adding 18C6 to the MHP film, the main peaks obviously shift to higher binding energy due to the interaction of Pb2+ with O atoms of 18C6. Moreover, the XPS peaks corresponding to metallic Pb vanish, which implies that the crown ether binds to the undercoordinated Pb2+ cation that is responsible for the surface defects. The XPS spectra further confirm the interaction between 18C6 crown ether and Cs+/Pb2+ cations, which effectively suppresses the surface defects.

Fig. 5b presents the XRD profiles of the doctor-bladed (FA0.8MA0.15Cs0.05)Pb(I0.85Br0.15)3 MHP film doped with different concentrations of 18C6 ranging from 0, 0.05, 0.25, 0.45, 0.95 to 1.9 mM. The characteristic peaks at 14.18°, 20.05°, 24.63°, 28.49°, 31.91°, 35.04°, 38.88°, 40.68°, and 43.25° are attributed to the (001), (011), (111), (002), (012), (112), (400), (022), and (003) planes of the (FA0.8MA0.15Cs0.05)Pb(I0.85Br0.15)3 MHP, respectively.33 We compare the crystallinity of the MHP films with different 18C6 concentrations by examining the XRD peak intensities of facets corresponding to the Miller indices, namely (001), (002), and (003) facets. Table S1 (ESI†) presents the XRD peak intensity ratios of (001), (002), and (003) facets that are normalized to that of FTO as a reference. With increasing concentrations of 18C6 in the MHP precursor, the XRD peak ratios along the (001), (002), and (003) facets are simultaneously enhanced, indicating that the MHP structure is well established along the c-axis. It is noted that the MHP film with 0.95 mM exhibits the strongest XRD peak along the (002) facet than the others. We speculate that the coordination between 18C6 and Pb2+ slows down the MHP growth rate and well arranges the B-site cations in the MHP lattice structure along the c-axis.39 A higher 18C6 concentration of 1.9 mM in the MHP films further reduces the growth rate to form highly ordered nanocrystals that could be responsible for the high XRD peak intensity along the (001) facet than the others. The mean grain size corresponding to the (002) facet is further estimated from the Scherrer equation shown in eqn (3): (3)where τ is the mean grain size, K is the shape factor (0.9), λ is the X-ray wavelength (1.54 nm), β is the line broadening at half the maximum intensity (FWHM), and θ is the Bragg angle. The mean grain size of MHP films with different concentrations of 18C6 is summarized in Table S2 (ESI†), revealing that the MHP grain size is significantly enhanced from 426.2 to 940.7 nm, when the concentration of 18C6 in the MHP precursor varies from 0 to 0.95 mM. When the concentration of 18C6 is increased to 1.9 mM, the MHP film delivers a reduced average mean grain size of 810.3 nm, presumably due to the formation of nanocrsytals. A similar trend in the MHP domain size is observed from the SEM images for the MHP films with increasing 18C6 concentration (refer to Fig. 1j–m). The above results suggest that appropriate amounts of 18C6 in the MHP precursor can assist the growth of MHP to the preferred crystalline orientation along the (002) facet and enhance the MHP domain size. There is no noticeable shift of the characteristic XRD peaks of MHP with different 18C6 contents, suggesting that 18C6 facilitates the MHP crystallinity toward the preferred orientation instead of incorporating into the MHP lattice structure.
To further realize the impact of 18C6 on the MHP film, the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) is performed and the results are summarized in Fig. 5c. The MHP films are scratched off from the substrate and milled into powders for the TGA measurement. The TGA results for DMSO and 18C6 are presented for comparison, and the weight loss for DMSO and 18C6 starts from the temperatures of 61.5 °C and 134.8 °C, respectively. The TGA results for the MHP without 18C6 show three stages of weight loss starting from 151 °C. The weight loss of 2.1 wt% with temperature starting from 151 °C is presumably attributed to the compound of (FA0.8MA0.15Cs0.05PbI2.55Br0.45) (DMSO)1.9 due to the ease of coordination between Pb2+ and DMSO, as confirmed in the literature.51 The weight losses between the temperature interval of 245–410 °C and over 410 °C are 20.31 wt% and 77.59 wt%, respectively. With 0.95 mM 18C6 doped into the MHP precursor, the weight loss at the above temperature range turns into 22.18 wt% (254 °C < T < 412 °C) and 77.82 wt% (T > 412 °C), respectively, and no weight loss at the first stage (starting from 151 °C) is detected. This weight loss behavior is similar to the TGA results for single crystalline MHP.52 There is no other weight loss attributed to solvent or impurity composition. The result suggests that DMSO can be replaced by 18C6 due to the high coordination ability of 18C6 with Pb2+via intermolecular exchange.53
Impacts of 18C6 on the photovoltaic performance of doctor-bladed PSCs are scrutinized. The device structure with a n–i–p heterojunction architecture, whose fabrication process is similar to those reported in our previous works,54 is composed of a fluorine-doped tin oxide-coated glass (FTO) substrate, ultrathin TiO2 as a blocking layer (b-TiO2), mesoporous TiO2 (meso-TiO2) as an electron transport layer (ETL), a MHP active layer, a hole transport layer (HTL) of spiro-OMeTAD and a gold (Au) electrode (denoted as FTO/b-TiO2/meso-TiO2/MHP/spiro-OMeTAD/Au). Fig. 6a presents the statistic PCE as a function of 18C6 concentration and indicates that addition of 18C6 to the doctor-bladed PSCs improves the device reproducibility. The corresponding statistic photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. The J–V curves of the best-performed PSCs with different concentrations of 18C6 are compared in Fig. 6b and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are compared in Table S3 (ESI†). The PSC without 18C6 achieves a low PCE of 7.8%, mainly due to a poor fill factor (FF), while that with 0.95 mM 18C6 delivers the best power conversion efficiency of 14.7%.

As seen in the top-view and cross-sectional SEM image of the device in Fig. 1f and 4c, the pristine MHP film exhibits a rough surface; especially at the dendrite boundary, the protrusion causes an uneven coverage of spiro-OMeTAD on the top of MHP. Direct contact between the MHP film and top metal electrode results in a low shunting resistance (Rsh) and poor FF for the resultant device. When the MHP film is doped with 0.95 mM 18C6, the MHP film has enhanced domain size (refer to Fig. 1h) along with reduced surface roughness (refer to Fig. 4b). The smooth surface roughness improves the coverage of spiro-OMeTAD on the MHP film to prevent the direct contact between the MHP light absorber and metal electrode (refer to Fig. 4d). We also apply 3D OM to macroscopically analyze the MHP film surface. We scrape half area of the MHP film from the substrate to verify the film thickness. Fig. 4a and b show the 3D OM images of the doctor-bladed MHP film with and without 18C6. The color bar represents the height of the MHP film relative to the substrate. The thickness of the bladed MHP film examined by the 3D OM is 810 nm, which is similar to that used in the device (refer to Fig. 4c and d). The MHP film with 18C6 exhibits a much uniform surface compared to that without 18C6, indicating that the addition of 18C6 can reduce the film roughness.
The time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurements are conducted as shown in Fig. 6c to estimate the carrier lifetime of the MHP films with different concentrations of 18C6. The carrier lifetime estimated from TRPL, which is fitted with two exponential decays, is shown in Table S4 (ESI†). The average charge carrier lifetime of the MHP films systematically increases from 47.6 to 142.7 ns, when the concentration of 18C6 is increased from 0 to 0.95 mM. The enhanced charge carrier lifetime is correlated with the reduced trap density that can further reduce the series resistance (Rs) of PSCs. As evidenced from Table 1, the series resistance of PSCs reduces from 207.3 to 131.9 Ω, when the concentration of 18C6 in the MHP precursor is increased from 0 to 0.95 mM. It is noted that the MHP film doped with 1.9 mM delivers a shorter carrier lifetime of 128.3 ns compared to that doped with 0.95 mM. The reduced carrier lifetime is presumably due to the MHP nanocrystals on the surface that could serve as recombination centers.
To sum up, addition of 18C6 involved in this work increases the charge transport capability and improves the FF, JSC and VOC of the doctor-bladed PSCs, leading to a superior PCE than the pristine PSCs. The PCE of doctor-bladed PSCs is profoundly improved after adding 18C6. When the concentration of 18C6 is 0.95 mM, the device delivers the best performance with a JSC of 22.4 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.96 mV, a FF of 68% and a PCE of 14.7%. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) of pristine PSCs and PSCs doped with 0.95 mM 18C6 is compared in Fig. 6d. The EQE of PSCs with 18C6 is much higher than that of the pristine PSCs, suggesting that the enhanced carrier lifetime in the 18C6-doped MHP film facilitates the charge extraction. As a result, an improved JSC for the 18C6-doped PSC is achieved, whose value is close to the integrated current density from the EQE spectrum.
Fig. S4 (ESI†) shows the J–V curves of the best-performed PSC with 0.95 mM 18C6 under forward scan (FS: from open circuit to short circuit) and reverse scan (RS: from short circuit to open circuit) compared with that of the pristine PSC. The hysteresis index (HI) is defined according to the following eqn (4):18 (4)where JRS (0.8VOC) and JFS (0.8VOC), respectively, correspond to the current density at 80% VOC for the RS and FS. The 0.8VOC is the value at which hysteresis effect is severe.55 The HIs of PSCs with different concentrations of 18C6 are listed in Table S3 (ESI†) for comparison. The HI for the device without 18C6 is 0.74, whereas the HI is 0.12 for the device with 0.95 mM 18C6. The PSC with 18C6 exhibited a low HI presumably due to the reduced trap density. While 1.9 mM 18C6 is added to the MHP precursor, the device exhibits a lower PCE and a higher HI, as compared to the device doped with 0.95 mM, due to the presence of MHP nanocrystals on the MHP film surface. The smooth MHP film surface and enhanced MHP domain size for the 0.95 mM-doped MHP film improve the charge transport capability and the device performance. Furthermore, the photovoltaic parameters for the PSCs with different active areas are compared in Table S5 (ESI†). The large-area single device fabricated with 0.95 mM 18C6 under the ambient process, whose active area is 2.4 cm2, exhibits a PCE of 9.7 ± 1.1% (the best PCE of 10.1%) with a JSC of 17.1 ± 4.1 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.96 ± 0.01 V and an FF of 58.9 ± 9.6%. The poor FF is mainly due to a high resistivity of the transparent conductive oxide. The large-area devices could be further improved by using an interconnected monolithic module or a substrate deposited with a metal-grid for a single cell.
3. Conclusions
In summary, we use the L-SEM technology to correlate the effects of 18C6 on the MHP precursor with the MHP film quality. The results confirm that additive 18C6 in the MHP precursor effectively suppresses the size of MHP-based micelles, and the 18C6-added precursor exhibits a more consistent micellar size than the pristine MHP precursor. The consistent-sized micelles with a small micellar size are beneficial for improving the MHP film quality. When the 18C6-doped MHP precursor is doctor-bladed onto a preheated substrate under an ambient atmosphere, 18C6 retards the MHP crystallization rate within the micelles. After micelle coalescence, the MHP crystal undergoes recrystallization to produce a smooth film with a large domain and MHP domain size. The 18C6-doped PSCs exhibit an efficiency of 14.7% with an active area of 0.1 cm2, while a large-area device with an active area of 2.4 cm2 presents an efficiency of 10.1%. Our work paves a way toward scalable, easy to produce, and eco-friendly PSCs by adding the crystal growth retarder 18C6.
