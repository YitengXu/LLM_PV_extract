    , Accepted 12th March 2019First published on 12th March 2019AbstractThere is an overwhelming desire to discover new catalytic materials for efficient water oxidation that perform at low overpotentials (below 1.50 V vs. RHE), and which exhibit tremendous stability along with high oxygen evolution reaction (OER) current density over a small potential window. However, it remains a challenge to establish a competent solar to fuel conversion system. We present here the first example of a nanoscale nanoporous Pd-derived benchmark material used as a highly stable and low overpotential electrocatalyst for water oxidation. The Pd electrocatalyst executes water oxidation at an onset potential of just 1.43 V vs. RHE; η = 200 mV. The catalyst also exhibits remarkable performance for OER, reaching a current density of 10 mA cm−2 at 1.47 V (η = 240 mV), and with a current density of 100 mA cm−2 achieved at only 1.63 V (η = 400 mV), which represents better OER activity than that of the benchmark IrO2 electrocatalyst (301 mV and 313 mV required to drive a current density of 10 mAcm−2). Furthermore, the catalyst demonstrates a Tafel slope of 40 mV dec−1, a high mass activity of 560 mA mg−1 (MA) and a large TOF value of 0.2 s−1, and exhibits remarkable long-term stability for use in oxygen evolution experiments. A thin-film Pd electrocatalyst was obtained via the Aerosol-Assisted Chemical Vapor Deposition (AACVD) method on conducting surfaces. XRD and XPS analyses showed a phase-pure crystalline metallic Pd deposit. A surface morphology study revealed a nanoparticulate highly porous nanostructure. Our study reveals a straightforward method for the development of the first example of a Pd-derived nanoporous electrocatalyst for high-efficiency water oxidation and for chemical energy conversion.
Introduction
The increasing level of CO2 in the atmosphere that is directly associated with the greenhouse effect and global warming has initiated many concerns in both political and scientific debates regarding its capture and subsequent transformation into storable chemicals and fuels.1–3 The foremost cause of increasing CO2 emissions is the burning of conventional fossil fuels in automobile combustion engines and in power stations. Meanwhile, natural assets of fuels such as gas and crude oil are also depleting rapidly due to their continuous utilization.4–6 The increasing demand for energy has focused the attention of researchers towards the synthesis and storage of renewable energy sources such as hydrogen-based fuels that can be obtained via water splitting.7,8 The development of efficient and cost-effective water splitting assemblies would represent a key technological advance in the pursuit of a hydrogen-based fuel and energy economy.9,10 Electrochemical or photoelectrochemical water splitting processes produce protons and electrons that can be combined to make H2 along with the generation of molecular oxygen as side-product. The protons and electrons evolved during water splitting can also be advantageously combined with CO2 in order to reduce it into methanol, formic acid and other useful products.11,12 This concept provides a route to solve both energy problems and environmental issues whilst exploiting the abundant water resources and sunlight available on Earth.13 However, the real challenge is to identify an efficient material that can be obtained from Earth-abundant resources and which is able to exhibit excellent performance for desired catalytic processes.
In order to make hydrogen production from the splitting of H2O more energy efficient, an effective catalytic system must be implemented for water oxidation to facilitate the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with ease.14 Therefore, in order to obtain a high fuel production rate, both of the half reactions of water splitting (oxidation and reduction) have to proceed with optimum efficiency.15 However, the oxygen evolution reaction imposes more overpotential penalties and makes the process kinetically and thermodynamically unfavourable. Therefore, the efficiency of the overall electrocatalysis process depends upon the activity of the electrocatalyst mediating the oxygen evolution reaction to generate oxygen gas, electrons and protons.16 Due to this, the development of benchmark catalytic materials that can facilitate multiple electron and proton transfer for water splitting over a narrow potential window is of tremendous significance.17 This has triggered the development of electrochemically-driven water oxidation schemes utilizing molecular catalysts and oxide-based inorganic systems.18,19 A competent water oxidation catalyst is desired to perform OER at a low overpotential (below 1.50 V vs. RHE), and must exhibit tremendous stability along with the ability to demonstrate high current density for long-term oxygen evolution.
Nature has designed a magnificent molecular nanocluster of MnCaOx, which is capable of performing water oxidation with tremendous rate and ease. Inspired by the photosystem-II water oxidation assembly, many molecular and heterogeneous materials have recently been employed for water oxidation predominantly in near-neutral pH and alkaline solutions.20,21 Molecular assemblies, being unstable, are not preferably studied for water oxidation catalysis, whereas inorganic oxide and related heterogeneous catalytic systems, being stable and synthetically accessible, can be considered for practical applications.22–24 Recently, several inorganic oxides have been extensively explored for water oxidation catalysis in both acidic and alkaline media.25,26 The state-of-the-art oxygen evolution electrocatalysts, oxides of ruthenium and iridium, are not eligible candidates for large scale industrial applications due to their scarcity and high cost.27 Although first-row transition metal oxides and hydroxides have been exploited for water oxidation catalysis, their long-term stability and catalytic activity have often hindered their wide-scale terrestrial applications.28
The race is therefore on to identify a better candidate that can reduce the potential penalty and exhibit high stability for the OER process. A good water oxidation electrocatalyst that can operate at a lower overpotential, demonstrate a high TOF value, and which is able to produce a stable current density of 10–100 mA cm−2 whilst exhibiting high stability under vigorous oxidative conditions, is considered to be ideal for wide-scale industrial application.29,30 Furthermore, the development of nanotextured morphological features possessing a large number of open electroactive sites is highly desirable for more efficient electron transfer and facile mass transport during the catalytic reaction.31 Herein, we report, for the first time, nanoporous Pd-derived highly stable nanoscale materials for water oxidation catalysis executing OER at a remarkably low overpotential. The Pd electrocatalyst performs water oxidation at an onset potential of just 1.43 V vs. RHE in an alkaline medium and exhibits tremendous stability and activity for long time testing. The Pd electrocatalysts are easily deposited on an FTO substrate via Aerosol-Assisted Chemical Vapor Deposition (AACVD) from a molecular precursor of palladium, acetylacetone Pd(acac)2, in toluene at different deposition times. This is a unique example of a Pd-based electrocatalytic system composed of a single metal that is easily transformed into a thin-film in a single step, and which is highly accessible for direct implementation in water oxidation.
Results and discussion
Catalyst preparation and characterization
Electrocatalytically active Pd thin films are easily deposited on FTO substrates from a transparent yellow precursor solution of palladium acetylacetone, Pd(acac)2, in toluene at different deposition times (Scheme 1). The AACVD method is employed here to make palladium thin-film electrodes at different deposition times of 40, 60, 90, 120 and 180 min on FTO substrates in a N2 gas environment. The as-deposited Pd thin films are blackish-grey in colour and are well adhered with the conducting substrates. No further treatment or annealing is applied to these Pd samples.
 Scheme 1  Schematic illustration of the AACVD setup used for the synthesis of the palladium films. 
SEM images of the different Pd samples show an increased spongy texture and fine structure with increased deposition time and prolonged heating. The Pd-based nanostructures are tiny and distributed all over the surface (Fig. 1). The SEM images also show the growth behavior of the palladium (Pd) film electrodes upon increasing the deposition time from 60 to 180 min. The Pd film deposited on the FTO surface reveals a structure with a cluster shape morphology. Additionally, the morphology and growth of the film reveals that the spicules of the sponge crystals exhibit multiple sphere-like porous hierarchical structures. FESEM images showed that with increasing deposition time and precursor consumption, the Pd layers grew with similar morphology and the layer thickness increased quite linearly. Therefore, the porous sphere-like structure was self-propagating, resulting in several nanoparticles reaching several tens to thousands nm higher surface area and high porosity of the Pd clusters with the lowest density clusters. The films were characterized by a microstructure made up of nano- to sub-micro-meter spicules of the sponge shaped clusters, which may result in the high activity values, subsequently prolonging the efficient catalytic oxidation of water. A cross-sectional view clearly shows the Pd film thickness increasing with deposition time along with prolonged heating at 475 °C, and with a more spongy texture (Fig. S1†). The spongy texture is also induced in the Pd film for longer deposition times up to 180 min, which is attributed to the prolonged heating duration.
 Fig. 1  Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images for the palladium film electrodes, Pd60, Pd90, Pd120 and Pd180, deposited for 60, 90, 120 and 180 min of deposition time on FTO substrates at 475 °C from palladium acetylacetonate via AACVD. 
Compositional analyses of the nanoscale Pd thin-films fabricated at different deposition times (Pd40, Pd60, Pd90, Pd120 and Pd180) were conducted via energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) analysis. EDX patterns of all of the Pd samples (Pd40, Pd60, Pd90, Pd120, and Pd180) are shown in energy dispersive X-ray spectra (Fig. S2†). EDX elemental analysis reveals the presence of Pd in the deposited film along with some minor signals from oxygen and carbon. The background signatures clearly disappear as the thickness of the Pd films increases with time. Carbon assimilation from the organic precursor is also observed. However, the content of Pd dominates in the deposited catalytic films.31–33 The surface composition of the Pd-type electrocatalytic films was also analyzed via X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) experiments (see later section).
The XRD patterns of the Pd thin films clearly evidence the deposited metallic palladium, as demonstrated by the reflections in the (111), (200), (220), (311) and (222) planes at 2θ values of 40.0°, 46.5°, 68.0°, 81.0° and 86.4°, respectively (Fig. 2a), which correspond well with the standard pattern (BD-01-088-2335). This observation confirms the presence of metallic Pd with an fcc structure.32 The XRD patterns of the palladium thin films deposited as a function of deposition time (40, 60, 90, 120 and 180 min) reveal an increase in film crystallinity with increasing deposition time and heating. All of the XRD patterns are similar in terms of the peak positions (2θ values), and a preferred orientation along the (111) plane is observed. The XRD patterns show excellent agreement with the standard library card (ICSD 01-088-2335) and reveal the formation of pure palladium in the cubic phase. It can be clearly observed that the crystalline phase of palladium remains unchanged when the deposition time is increased from 40–180 min. However, the crystallinity of the palladium films increases with increasing deposition time and heating duration, which can be clearly shown by looking at the peak height of (111) located at 40.0° (Fig. 2a). Although the precursor Pd(acac)2 contains oxygen atoms, it undergoes complete thermal decomposition under the inert conditions of AACVD and eliminates an organic moiety in the form of CO2, and in the presence of N2 Pd-oxide formation was not observed, as shown from analysis of the XRD data. Besides the crystallinity of the Pd films, no crystalline side products (palladium-based oxides) were observed, and all crystalline peaks are in complete agreement with phase-pure Pd.
 Fig. 2  (a) XRD patterns of the palladium film electrodes, Pd40, Pd60, Pd90, Pd120 and Pd180, deposited for 40, 60, 90, 120 and 180 min of deposition time at T = 475 °C. (b) An XPS survey spectrum and the in-set image show the high resolution XPS spectrum for the binding energies of the Pd180 sample regarding the Pd(0) state (the Pd films were deposited from palladium acetylacetonate in toluene solution via the AACVD method at T = 475 °C). 
The XPS survey spectrum reveals that the catalyst surface composition contains Pd as the main constituent element (Fig. 2b). Furthermore, the oxidation state and nature of Pd in the thin film electrodes were examined by recording a high-resolution XPS scan of the Pd180 sample (Fig. S3†). The doublet at binding energies of 333.5 eV and 339.0 eV is attributed to Pd 3d5/2 and Pd 3d3/2, respectively (inset of Fig. 2b).34,35 These binding energy values are in agreement with the literature values reported for metallic Pd0.36 Minor oxide formation on the palladium surface is represented by a small shoulder at high binding energies of the palladium 3d peaks. However, in the present case the shoulder is absent, thus suggesting that there was no formation of oxide on the palladium layer.37 The XPS results further validate and support the XRD data regarding the synthesis of impurity-free pure palladium thin-films even for longer deposition times (up to 180 min).
For the water oxidation studies, voltammetry (E vs. I) experiments were conducted in 0.1 M KOH solution under forward potential sweeps. The linear sweeps voltammetry (LSV) profile shows that the Pd-derived electrocatalytic films initiate the water oxidation reaction at remarkably low overpotentials, with very high current densities reached for the oxygen evolution reaction within a small potential window (Fig. 3). A water oxidation catalyst that can execute oxygen evolution below 1.55 V (vs. RHE) is regarded as an excellent OER electrocatalyst material, and the Pd samples shown here demonstrate an operating OER onset potential of under 1.55 V (vs. RHE).38 The onset potential shifts sequentially towards a more negative window as the deposition time is increased from 40 to 180 min.
 Fig. 3  Forward potential sweeps for the Pd40, Pd60, Pd90, Pd120 and Pd180 electrocatalytic materials in a 0.1 M KOH electrolyte solution at a scan rate of 20 mV s−1. The inset shows a magnified view of the LSV for the Pd180 sample. 
The Pd180 film electrocatalyst is advantageously shown to initiate water oxidation at just 1.43 V vs. RHE with an onset overpotential of only 200 mV. As the potential sweeps towards the anodic sweep, the catalytic wave abruptly increases in magnitude and reaches a value of >150 mA cm−2 at a potential of just under 1.65 V vs. RHE (η = 420 mV), with current densities of 10 mA cm−2 and 100 mA cm−2 achieved at just 1.47 V (η = 240 mV) and 1.63 V (η = 400 mV), respectively. The overpotential that is required to maintain a current density of 10 mA cm−2 when using the as-synthesized Pd180-type catalytic film is much lower than the benchmark value of 350 mV. This sustained current density of 10 mA cm−2 is a pre-requisite for the 10% efficient conversion of solar energy into chemical fuels.39 All of these fantastic properties of the thin film catalyst derived from Pd mean that the system is highly applicable for water oxidation tests. Furthermore, it is notable that all of the catalytic materials discussed here demonstrate a very low onset overpotential within the range of 200 to 250 mV, which is attributed to the highly nanoporous structure. As revealed by SEM imaging, the nanoporous structure of the thin film is enhanced by increasing the deposition time from 40 to 180 min and, consequently, an increased current density value and a much lower overpotential are observed. The much-enhanced electrocatalytic behavior of the Pd180-derived thin films is directly correlated to the porosity, as a highly porous structure can facilitate efficient charge transfer and mass transport in the catalytic process for water oxidation.
For a sustained and high rate water oxidation reaction, the catalyst should operate over a narrow potential range whilst producing a high current density for the oxygen evolution process. Accordingly, we measured the Tafel plots of all of the catalysts within the linear regions fitted into the Tafel equation (η = blogJ +a), where b is the Tafel slope. Almost all of the Pd catalysts discussed here demonstrate enhanced kinetics whilst displaying much lower Tafel slope values, as shown in Fig. 4a. A small Tafel slope is an indication of well-balanced kinetics during catalysis. However, Pd180 demonstrates a much lower value of just 40 mV per decade in comparison to those of the other candidates such as Pd40 (44 mV per decade), Pd60 (61 mV per decade), Pd90 (86 mV per decade) and Pd120 (67 mV per decade). The open structure morphological features and high crystallinity of the Pd180 catalyst support mass transfer and boost electron transfer without undergoing any scattering losses. In order to obtain more insight into the catalysis kinetics, impedance spectroscopy was utilized. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) experiments on different thickness Pd films showed that Pd180 exhibited the lowest charge transfer resistance (Rct) of just 2 Ω, as is obtainable from the x-axis intercept of the semicircle in the low-frequency region (Fig. 4b). This feature corresponds to the favorable charge transfer kinetics at the catalyst–electrolyte interface (Fig. S4†).

Bottom panel: Nyquist plots for Pd40, Pd60, Pd90, Pd120 and Pd180 at an applied potential of 1.48 V vs. RHE in the frequency range of 0.1 Hz to 100 kHz. For each EIS analysis, the data was fitted by employing a Randles circuit with the Nova software (inset figure). The charge transfer resistances for Pd40 ≈ 15 Ω, Pd60 ≈ 13 Ω, Pd90 ≈ 11 Ω, Pd120 ≈ 6 Ω and Pd180 ≈ 2.1 Ω were estimated by fitting a simplified Randles circuit. 
Moreover, the stability of the highly efficient benchmark Pd180 catalyst was evaluated by conducting repetitive LSV scans under similar electrochemical conditions (Fig. S5†). The catalyst produces similar electrochemical signals for the 1st and 500th CV cycles, thus signifying no loss of catalytic performance under vigorous oxidative conditions (Fig. 5). Additionally, the remarkable catalytic efficiency was also demonstrated by comparing the mass activity and turn over frequency of all of the catalysts at preferably 0.35 V. Pd180 outperformed the other catalysts, demonstrating higher values of 560 mA mg−1 (MA) and 0.2 s−1 (TOF) at 0.35 V (the mass activity and TOF values of all of the catalysts are listed in Table S1†). Furthermore, electroactive area analysis implied that Pd180 has a higher number of electroactive sites (ECSA = 20 cm2) available for significant charge transfer during the catalytic process (Table S1 and Fig. S6–S10†).

Long-term catalytic tests for OER on various thin film Pd samples show a very high stability of the electrocatalysts for water oxidation under modest electrochemical conditions. Under constant current densities of 20 mA cm−2 and 100 mA cm−2, the Pd thin films demonstrate sustained potential values for OER under very harsh oxidative conditions (Fig. 6). The slight shift in the potential in some cases is due to the accumulation of a very high density of oxygen gas at the electrode surface, thus covering the active sites used for catalysis. A rich continuous stream of oxygen bubbles could be seen coming off of the electrode surface during the CCE experiment, which is due to the high rate of the oxygen evolution reaction for the Pd40, Pd60, Pd90, Pd120 and Pd180 electrocatalytic materials.33,40 The much higher current density value and outstanding stability is attributed to the excellent catalytic activity of said catalysts under the employed electrochemical conditions. The Pd-based catalysts retained their stability and identity, as revealed by SEM analyses conducted after the repetitive LSV and CCE tests (Fig. S11†). This demonstrates the good surface structure stability of the Pd thin-film catalysts for OER, even under highly oxidative conditions.

The focus here is to develop a low OER onset overpotential single metal/element electrocatalyst material that is simple, easy to fabricate as a thin-film on a conducting substrate in a single step, and highly accessible for directly application in water oxidation systems. Oxides of the first row transition metals, mixed metal oxides and other related materials are not stable for long-term application. They also require tedious synthesis methods and high temperature annealing, and multiple steps are involved in electrode fabrication. They also require a higher OER onset potential (E/V > 1.50 V vs. RHE) relative to our new single-metal Pd-based electrocatalyst, which can execute OER at only E/V = 1.43 V (vs. RHE); η = 200 mV. We use Pd in this study as we are interested in investigating new materials and opportunities for electrocatalysis in chemical energy conversion, and only a thin-film of Pd as a single metal/element is required in order to make a stable and efficient state-of-the-art anode material for sustained and high performance water oxidation. This material has been tested at tremendously high current densities of up to 100 mA cm−2 for OER and it remains highly stable and efficient. Noble metals that are more efficient and stable, and which can be easily assembled into an electrode and corresponding system, can be exploited for better and long-term applications in comparison with other metals that are less stable and which are difficult to apply in electrocatalytic systems. Furthermore, the scope of this work was to test Pd only in alkaline media. Work evaluating its performance in other media and in acids is in process and will be the subject of forthcoming research.
Experimental
For water oxidation catalysis in this study, five palladium thin-film electrodes, namely Pd40, Pd60, Pd90, Pd120 and Pd180, were prepared at T = 475 °C on FTO substrates by using a yellow palladium acetylacetonate solution in an Aerosol-Assisted Chemical Vapor Deposition set-up. The palladium thin-films, Pd40, Pd60, Pd90, Pd120 and Pd180, were deposited on clean FTO substrates following 40, 60, 90, 120 and 180 minutes of deposition time, respectively, under a continuous flow of N2. Detail of the synthesis are given below. No further heat treatment was applied and the Pd films were clean and in contact with the FTO substrates.41
Synthesis of the thin film Pd electrocatalyst materials
Palladium thin film electrodes were produced via the AACVD (Aerosol-Assisted Chemical Vapor Deposition) method. The design and assembly of the AACVD setup is shown in Scheme 1. The precursor solution was synthesized by dissolving palladium acetylacetone, Pd(acac)2, (200 mg, 0.64 mM) in toluene (20 mL), and the resultant transparent yellow solution was used for the growth of the palladium thin films by the AACVD method. Prior to deposition, simple and conducting glass substrates (FTO and plain glass) with dimensions of 1.0 × 2.5 cm2 (W × L) were cleaned with soapy water, acetone and isopropanol, followed by water, and then dried in an oven at 90 °C. For each of the deposition experiments, the substrate was aligned horizontally inside the reactor tube, pre-heated up to the deposition temperature (475 °C) and kept there for 10 minutes in order to equilibrate the temperature, then the deposition process was started. Aerosol mist from the Pd(acac)2/toluene solution was generated using a piezoelectric ultrasonic humidifier, and the aerosol was injected into the reactor tube carried by a stream of nitrogen (N2) gas at a rate of 150 cm3 min−1. The deposition experiments were carried out over a desired time period (40–180 min). The waste exhaust of the precursor mist was vented into a fume-hood. After deposition, the films were allowed to cool to room temperature under a continuous flow of N2 gas. The resultant palladium thin-film electrodes were smooth and uniform, shiny, greyish in colour and stable in air. The adhesion property of the palladium thin film was verified by carrying out a ‘Scotch tape test’ and the layers were found to in strong contact with the FTO substrate. Multiple films of all of the samples were also synthesized in order to determine the reproducibility of the process.
Characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the palladium films were recorded using a Rigaku MiniFlex X-ray diffractometer (Japan) with Cu Kα1 radiation (γ = 0.15416 nm), a tube current of 10 mA, and an accelerating voltage of 30 kV. Scanning electron microscope images of the film electrodes were obtained using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, Lyra3, Tescan, Czech Republic) at an accelerating voltage of 20 kV. The elemental stoichiometries and compositions of the film electrodes were investigated via Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX, INCA Energy 200, Oxford Inst.) spectroscopy. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) experiments were carried out using a Thermos Scientific Escalab 250Xi spectrometer equipped with a monochromatic Al Kα (1486.6 eV) X-ray source, with a resolution of 0.5 eV. During XPS characterization, ambient temperature conditions were maintained while the pressure was controlled at 5 × 10−10 mbar. The spectra were referenced using the adventitious C 1s peak at 284.5 eV.
Electrochemical measurements
All of the electrochemical measurements were carried out using a computer-controlled AUTOLAB instrument potentiostat electrochemical work station employing an FTO electrode coated with a Pd-derived catalytic film as the working electrode, Pt wire shaped into a spiral (thickness = 0.25 mm) as the counter electrode, and saturated silver–silver chloride (Ag/AgCl in a saturated solution of KCl) as the reference electrode. For the long-term electrocatalysis, a saturated calomel (Hg/HgO) reference electrode was employed in a 0.1 M KOH solution. However, all of the potentials are in reference to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) following the Nernst equation:ERHE = EREF + E0REF + 0.059 (pH)
Prior to use, the FTO glass slides were cleaned by sonicating them in methanol, ultrapure water and finally in acetone for 15 minutes in each, before finally being dried in an oven at about 80 °C for 30 minutes. Before placing into the electrochemical cell, the platinum wire was cleaned by immersing it in a 20% solution of HNO3 for a few minutes followed by washing with MilliQ water. All of the glassware and electrochemical cells were cleaned by boiling in a 1:3 mixture of H2SO4 and HNO3 followed by boiling in water. The equipment was then carefully rinsed with acetone and dried in an oven at 100 °C for 1 hour, as described previously.42 Electrochemical investigations such as cyclic voltammetry, EIS and controlled-potential bulk electrolysis experiments were carried out in a 0.1 M KOH electrolyte solution with pH ≈ 13. The water that was used to make all of the solutions for the electrochemical studies was distilled and deionized using a MilliQ system from Millipore.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
EIS analyses were carried out in order to obtain more insight into the electrochemical kinetics of all of the Pd-based thin film electrocatalysts. The data was recorded at an applied potential of 1.49 V vs. RHE considering the faradaic region of the cyclic voltammogram in order to investigate the charge transfer resistance at the so-called electrode–electrolyte double layer.
Mass activity (MA) [mA mg−1]
The loading normalized current density or mass activity was calculated according to the following formula:  
Here, J is the current density in mA cm−2 at a specific potential value. We choose 1.58 V vs. RHE as the specific potential value.43
Turn over frequency (TOF) [s−1]
The TOF was calculated according to the following formula:  
Here, J is the current density in A cm−2 at 1.58 V vs. RHE, A is the geometrical area of the working electrode material (cm2), F is the Faraday constant in C mol−1 and n is the number of moles of catalyst deposited on the electrode.43
Electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) [cm2]
The electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) was calculated using the CV mode by calculating the double layer capacitance according to the following formula:  
First of all, the non-faradaic region (somewhere in between the oxygen and hydrogen region) in the CV was identified via visual analysis of the cyclic voltammetry data, assuming that all of the current in this potential range is due to double layer charging. Under this potential range, the CV was run at different scan rates (5 mV s−1, 10 mV s−1, 20 mV s−1 and 50 mV s−1). The charging current (Ic) was calculated by identifying the middle potential range, which was 0.955 V vs. RHE, and the current associated with this potential range was considered to be the capacitive current or charging current. A plot of scan rate versus capacitive current was constructed and the slope of this calibration curve gave the value of the double layer capacitance. Dividing CDL by the specific capacitance of the sample, which was 0.043 mF cm−2 in alkaline electrolyte solution for the metal electrodes, gave the ECSA value.39
Conclusions
An efficient electrocatalytic Pd system was prepared via the AACVD method using a simple Pd(acac)2 organometallic precursor deposited for various deposition times. It was observed that by increasing the deposition time, ultrafine and highly porous thin films could be obtained that demonstrate a very high number of electroactive sites during water oxidation catalysis. The Pd180-type catalytic film was shown to exhibit a remarkably low overpotential of just η = 200 mV (1.43 V vs. RHE) for OER. Moreover, the catalyst exhibits a much-enhanced electroactive surface area (ECSA = 20 cm2), a high mass activity of 560 mA mg−1 (MA), a large TOF value of 0.2 s−1, and marvellous stability during long-term continuous water electrolysis. All of these remarkable features make the Pd system a standard benchmark material for use in water oxidation electrocatalysis with the opportunity to scale up even further. It is expected that such a facile and compatible electrochemical assembly could be conveniently applied on a larger scale in future.

 	Scheme 1  Schematic illustration of the AACVD setup used for the synthesis of the palladium films.	 

 	Fig. 1  Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images for the palladium film electrodes, Pd60, Pd90, Pd120 and Pd180, deposited for 60, 90, 120 and 180 min of deposition time on FTO substrates at 475 °C from palladium acetylacetonate via AACVD.	 

 	Fig. 2  (a) XRD patterns of the palladium film electrodes, Pd40, Pd60, Pd90, Pd120 and Pd180, deposited for 40, 60, 90, 120 and 180 min of deposition time at T = 475 °C. (b) An XPS survey spectrum and the in-set image show the high resolution XPS spectrum for the binding energies of the Pd180 sample regarding the Pd(0) state (the Pd films were deposited from palladium acetylacetonate in toluene solution via the AACVD method at T = 475 °C).	 

 	Fig. 3  Forward potential sweeps for the Pd40, Pd60, Pd90, Pd120 and Pd180 electrocatalytic materials in a 0.1 M KOH electrolyte solution at a scan rate of 20 mV s−1. The inset shows a magnified view of the LSV for the Pd180 sample.	 

 	Fig. 4  Top panel: Tafel plots for the Pd40, Pd60, Pd90, Pd120 and Pd180 thin film electrocatalytic materials in a 0.1 M KOH electrolyte solution. Bottom panel: Nyquist plots for Pd40, Pd60, Pd90, Pd120 and Pd180 at an applied potential of 1.48 V vs. RHE in the frequency range of 0.1 Hz to 100 kHz. For each EIS analysis, the data was fitted by employing a Randles circuit with the Nova software (inset figure). The charge transfer resistances for Pd40 ≈ 15 Ω, Pd60 ≈ 13 Ω, Pd90 ≈ 11 Ω, Pd120 ≈ 6 Ω and Pd180 ≈ 2.1 Ω were estimated by fitting a simplified Randles circuit.	 

 	Fig. 5  Forward potential sweeps during the 1st (black line), 50th (green line), 100th (blue line), 200th (purple line) and 500th (Red line) LSV scans for the Pd180 electrocatalytic material in a 0.1 M KOH electrolyte solution at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1.	 

 	Fig. 6  Extended time water oxidation experiments during controlled-current water electrolysis at the Pd40, Pd60, Pd90, Pd120 and Pd180 thin-film electrocatalytic materials in a 0.1 M KOH electrolyte solution at constant current densities of 20 mA cm−2 and 100 mA cm−2.
