    , Accepted 11th June 2018First published on 18th June 2018AbstractAn axisymmetric heptacyclic lactam unit TD3 has been developed by replacing the thieno[3,2-b]thiophene core of a known acceptor unit TD1 with dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]thiophene. PThTD3 was obtained by copolymerizing TD3 with thiophene in good yield. PThTD3 showed red-shifted absorption, lower LUMO energy level, and better hole mobility relative to the analogue PThTD1. Inverted polymer solar cells based on PThTD3:PC71BM exhibited a decent PCE of 7.25%, which is much higher than that of PThTD1. These results have demonstrated that axisymmetric lactam TD3 is a good building block for PSC applications.
Polymer solar cells (PSCs), usually employing conjugated polymers as electron donors, and fullerene derivatives as electron acceptors, have attracted much attention due to their unique advantages such as low cost, solution processing, lightweight, and flexibility.1–7 Since 2015, the success of nonfullerene acceptor materials has revitalized PSCs and the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of single PSCs based on polymer donor material/nonfullerene acceptor material systems have exceeded 14%.8–12 As a result, many efficient small-molecule or polymer acceptors have been developed.13–23 Meanwhile, highly efficient polymer donor materials still need to be developed.24
In 2013, we synthesized a pentacyclic lactam acceptor unit thieno[2′,3′:5,6]pyrido[3,4-g]thieno[3,2-c]isoquinoline-5,11(4H,10H)-dione (TPTI) and its D–A copolymer PThTPTI exhibited a decent PCE of over 9%.25,26 Based on this work, lactam acceptor units BDTP, TD1, TD2 and TITI were developed by replacing the benzene ring of TPTI with 2,2′-bithiophene, thieno[3,2-b]thiophene or naphthalene. Meanwhile, a heptacyclic lactam unit TTP was also produced by replacing the terminal thiophenes of TPTI with two thieno[3,2-b]thiophenes. Copolymers based on these acceptor units have exhibited PCEs over 10%.27–31 In addition, these lactam acceptors are good building blocks for small-molecule donor and polymer acceptor materials, and have shown great potential in nonfullerene PSCs and tandem cells.32–39
It is noteworthy that these lactam acceptors reported by us all possess centrosymmetric chemical structures. Dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]thiophene (DTT) is a rigid and electron-donating unit and its copolymers possess high crystallinity and charge carrier mobilities.40–42 Herein, we have designed and synthesized an axisymmetric heptacyclic lactam unit TD3via replacing the thieno[3,2-b]thiophene of TD1 with dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]thiophene. As shown in Fig. 1, TD3 contains seven fused aromatic rings with five thiophenes and two pyridones. D–A copolymer PThTD3 based on a thiophene donor unit and TD3 was synthesized. The thermal, optical, and electrochemical properties, crystallinity, and hole mobility of PThTD3 were studied. Compared with PThTD1 based on centrosymmetric lactam acceptor TD1, PThTD3 exhibited an narrower optical bandgap and higher hole mobility. Under illumination of AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2), solar cells based on PThTD3:PC71BM exhibited a decent PCE of up to 7.25%, which is higher than that of its analogue PThTD1 (6.02%).29

The synthetic routes for the monomer TD3-Br and the target copolymer PThTD3 are shown in Scheme 1. After chlorination, two esterification reactions and dechlorination, diethyl dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]thiophene-3,5-dicarboxylate (5) was synthesized according to the literature methods using dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]thiophene as the starting material.43 The bromination and hydrolysis reaction of compound 5 afforded 2,6-dibromodithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]thiophene-3,5-dicarboxylic acid (7), which reacted with oxalyl chloride and N-(2-octyldodecyl)thiophen-3-amine44 successively to give compound 8. The key intermediate TD3 was obtained by intramolecular direct arylation using Pd(OAc)2 as the catalyst. The monomer TD3-Br was synthesized via the bromination of TD3. The copolymerization of TD3-Br with 2,5-bis(trimethylstannyl)thiophene afforded PThTD3 using Pd(PPh3)4 as the catalyst in toluene. All the reactions were performed easily and exhibited good yields. Since longer 2-octyldodecyl sidechains were introduced, PThTD3 possesses good solubility in common organic solvents, such as chloroform, chlorobenzene, and toluene. The number-average molecular weight (Mn) and weight-average molecular weight (Mw) of PThTD3 are 50.9 and 165.2 kDa, with a polydispersity index (PDI) of 3.24. As depicted in Fig. S3 (ESI†), the decomposition temperature (Td, 5 wt% loss) for PThTD3 is 462 °C, indicating its good thermal stability for organic photovoltaic applications.

The UV-vis absorption spectra of PThTD3 in dilute chloroform solutions (10−5 M) and in the solid state are shown in Fig. 2. It is obvious that PThTD3 possesses two absorption peaks both in solution and as a thin film, and they could be attributed to the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) or intermolecular π–π stacking, respectively.45,46 In solution, PThTD3 exhibits two absorption peaks at 587 and 635 nm, with an extinction coefficient of 5.75 × 104 M−1 cm−1 (635 nm). The absorption peaks of the PThTD3 thin film are located at 587 and 641 nm, with an extinction coefficient of 4.15 × 104 cm−1 (641 nm). A 6 nm red shift in the PThTD3 film indicated the better π–π stacking in the solid state. The absorption onset of PThTD3 in the film is located at 688 nm, corresponding to a medium optical bandgap of 1.80 eV. Compared with its analogue PThTD1 (1.82 eV), PThTD3 possessed a narrower optical bandgap. The replacement of the thieno[3,2-b]thiophene core of TD1 with dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]thiophene can extend the effective conjugation length, leading to lower optical bandgaps for the target copolymers,40–42,47 which is beneficial for higher photocurrents.

As shown in Fig. 3, X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis for the as-cast PThTD3 film was carried out to study the crystallinity. The diffraction peak at 2θ = 3.76° corresponds to an interlayer d-spacing of 23.48 Å, while the peak at 2θ = 24.55° corresponds to a d-spacing of 3.62 Å for π–π stacking. XRD results suggest that PThTD3 possesses good crystallinity, which may result in higher hole mobility and photovoltaic performance.48–50

Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were performed to investigate the electrochemical properties of PThTD3 and all potentials were calibrated against a ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) redox couple.25,51 As shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†), the onset of oxidation potential (Eoxon) of PThTD3 was observed at 0.54 V, corresponding to the HOMO energy level at −5.34 eV. The onset of reduction potential (Eredon) of PThTD3 was observed at −1.85 V, corresponding to the LUMO energy level at −2.95 eV, which is lower than that of PThTD1 (−2.56 eV). Higher open-circuit voltage (Voc) in PThTD3-based PSCs can be expected, due to the near ideal HOMO energy level.4
To investigate the photovoltaic performance of PThTD3, the inverted PSCs with the device structure of ITO/ZnO/PThTD3:PC71BM/MoO3/Al were fabricated. The details of optimization are summarized in Tables S1 and S2 (ESI†). 1,8-Diiodooctane (DIO) is one of the most useful additives, which can inhibit fullerene aggregation, and optimize the domain size and the D–A interface of the active layers, and thus many fullerene-based solar cells with DIO often possess much higher short circuit current (Jsc), fill factor (FF), and PCEs.52–55 Therefore, DIO was used to optimize the photovoltaic performance of PThTD3:PC71BM cells. As shown in Table 1 and Fig. 4a, the PCE of the PThTD3:PC71BM cell without DIO was just 3.61% under 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5 illumination. As expected, the solar cells with 1–3% DIO possess higher Jsc and FF values, and thus their photovoltaic performance was improved significantly. In particular, the PThTD3:PC71BM cell with 2% DIO exhibited a double PCE of 7.25%, with a Voc of 0.84 V, a Jsc of 12.87 mA cm−2 and a FF of 67.05%. It is worth noting that the PThTD3:PC71BM cell showed higher PCEs than the PThTD1:PC71BM cell (6.02%), which was mainly due to the higher Jsc (12.87 vs. 9.67 mA cm−2).29 Red-shift absorption and higher hole mobility may contribute to the higher Jsc, which will be discussed later. The improved Jsc was also confirmed by the external quantum efficiency (EQE) evaluation. As shown in Fig. 4b, the PThTD3:PC71BM cell exhibited over 60% EQE in the range of 377–653 nm, which was much higher than that of the PThTD1:PC71BM cell. The calculated current from the EQE curve is 12.54 mA cm−2, which is in good agreement with the Jsc obtained from the J–V measurements.

Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to study the morphology of the PThTD3:PC71BM blend films (Fig. S5, ESI†). The fibrous and smooth morphology of the blend film with 2% DIO could contribute to the improved charge dissociation, transport and collection, and then increased the Jsc and FF of PSCs. To further understand the higher EQE and Jsc of PThTD3, the hole mobility for the PThTD3:PC71BM blend film was measured using the space charge limited current (SCLC) method (Fig. 5). The hole mobility for PThTD3 is 4.89 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is slightly higher than PThTD1 (4.06 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1). The higher hole mobility of PThTD3 is in good agreement with the higher Jsc and EQE as mentioned above.56,57

Conclusions
In summary, an efficient D–A conjugated polymer PThTD3 based on an axisymmetric heptacyclic lactam unit TD3 and a thiophene donor unit has been designed and synthesized for application in PSCs. PThTD3 not only exhibits red-shifted UV-vis absorption compared with its counterpart PThTD1, but also maintains good crystallinity and higher hole mobility. These are the main reasons for the higher photocurrents. PSCs based on PThTD3:PC71BM exhibited a PCE of 7.25%, with a Voc of 0.84 V, a Jsc of 12.87 mA cm−2 and a FF of 67.05%. This efficiency was higher than that of PThTD1, which exhibited a PCE of only 6.02%. PThTD3 is a good medium-bandgap polymer donor material and shows great potential in tandem cells. Furthermore, the development of other high-performance axisymmetric lactam units and corresponding D–A copolymers is ongoing.
