    , Accepted 6th November 2018First published on 13th November 2018AbstractWhile polymer dielectric capacitors are preferred energy-storage components in electrical power systems, the low achievable energy densities (Ue) of existing polymer systems restrict their miniaturization and advanced applications. Here, we report the design and preparation of all-polymer sandwich structured films comprised of two outer layers of poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) to provide high breakdown strength and an interlayer of acrylic rubber dielectric elastomers (DEs) to offer high electric displacement. The energy storage performance of the sandwich architecture films can be significantly improved by modulating the thickness of DEs, as confirmed by the electric displacement–field (D–E) loops and leakage current measurements. Markedly enhanced electric displacement (Dmax − Dr = 11.01 μC cm−2) and a breakdown strength Eb of 438 MV m−1 have been achieved in the sandwich structured films with an optimum DE central layer thickness of 4 μm, which leads to an ultrahigh energy storage density of 20.92 J cm−3 and a high efficiency of 72%, by far the highest values ever achieved in all-polymer dielectrics. Excellent reliability in energy storage performance demonstrated by consecutive cycling is presented in the prepared layered films. The spatial organization of the DE into the sandwich structures provides an effective way for achieving the high energy storage capability for flexible energy storage devices.
1 Introduction
With the continuous exploitation of sustainable energy sources including nuclear, solar and wind power, efficient energy storage and conversion technologies are crucial for utilization of electricity generated from these renewable sources.1,2,45 Among currently available energy storage devices, polymer dielectric capacitors have distinct features such as ultrafast charge–discharge responses, low cost, light weight, facile processability and being environmentally friendly with respect to other available energy storage devices such as batteries.3,4 Generally, the energy density of dielectric materials can be illustrated as Ue = ∫EdD, in which E is the applied electric field and D is the electric displacement. Obviously, both the electric displacement and breakdown strength of the dielectric material are the two critical parameters defining the energy density of electrostatic capacitors.5,46 Unfortunately, most dielectric polymers possess intrinsic low dielectric constants (≤4) and small electric displacement owing to the small dipole moments of the chemical bonds in polymers, hence leading to limited energy densities. For example, the energy density of the best commercial biaxially oriented polypropylene (BOPP) capacitor films is merely ∼2 J cm−3 even at an ultrahigh breakdown strength of ∼640 MV m−1 due to their low electric displacement (D < 1.5 μC cm−2).47 The energy density of BOPP is over one order of magnitude lower than those of electrochemical devices such as batteries, supercapacitor, etc., i.e. ∼20 J cm−3.6–10 Exceptionally, as a typical ferroelectric polymer, poly(vinylidene difluoride) (PVDF) with strong dipole moments in their molecular chains can achieve relatively higher dielectric constants (K = 10–12) than other nonpolar polymers. However, its electric displacement (D < 10 μC cm−2) still falls short of burgeoning energy density requirements demanded for the miniaturization and improved reliability of advanced electrical power systems.11,12 Commonly, in polymer/ceramic nanocomposites, the realization of high dielectric constants and electric displacement in polymers needs high loadings of ceramic fillers (i.e., >50 vol%),13 which inevitably raises the issues of inhomogeneity and aggregation of fillers in the polymer matrix, resulting in dramatic deterioration in their mechanical flexibility, elasticity, dielectric loss, and breakdown strength. Therefore, it remains a challenge to develop approaches to simultaneously achieve enhanced electric displacement, high breakdown strength, excellent extractable energy density and great mechanical reliability in electrostatic capacitor films.14–16
Besides ferroelectric polymers, dielectric elastomers (DEs) are a class of field responsive electroactive polymers (EAPs), which can behave as actuators and undergo changes in size and/or shape in response to electrical stimulation.17–21 Yu et al. chose acrylic rubber dielectric elastomers as a third phase material to be introduced into PVDF based nanocomposites filled with BaTiO3 (BT) nanoparticles. The large elastic deformation of the polyacrylate elastomers increased the maximum displacement of the nanocomposites with increasing electric field but did not increase the remnant displacement.22 Undesirably, like ceramic fills, a high-volume fraction of DEs is needed to afford significantly enhanced electric displacement. On the other hand, the intrinsic high conductive loss and low breakdown strength of DEs substantially compromise the resulting energy-storage performance.23,24
Recently, topologically structured composites were rationally designed to combine synergistically the complementary properties of the spatially organized constituent layers.25,26 Topologically structured composites include an insulating layer to suppress conduction loss and avoid early breakdown under high electric fields due to the blocking effects of the interfaces between the neighboring layers, and have been widely used in the field of electrical insulation.27–29 It has been demonstrated experimentally that insulation layers with high Eb when placed near the electrodes can effectively impede the charge injection and introduce deep traps for charge carriers.11,44 Along this line, we take advantage of the topological-structures to develop flexible all-polymer sandwich-structured polymer films for energy storage applications. In this contribution, two outer layers of ferroelectric PVDF with high breakdown strength are used as insulating layers, while the central layers filled with DEs can then be polarized up to higher electric fields, thus substantially enhancing the corresponding electric displacement. The sandwich-structure films are proved to be more effective in suppressing energy loss and achieving superior energy storage performance compared to other structure configurations including single layered, double-decker and reverse sandwiched films. Consequently, the sandwich structure film via inserting a DE central layer of an optimized thickness of 4–5 μm shows an ultra-high displacement (Dmax − Dr = 11.01 μC cm−2), which represents an enhancement of ≈36% over that of neat PVDF films (Dmax − Dr = 8.1 μC cm−2). Consequently, an extraordinary extractable energy density of Ue = 20.92 J cm−3 with an energy extraction efficiency of 72% can be concomitantly obtained with an electric breakdown strength Eb of 438 MV m−1, which is not only higher than those of PVDF-based co- and ter-polymers but also more than 900% that of the commercial BOPP film (∼2 J cm−3 at 640 MV m−1). In addition, due to the viscoelastic characteristic of transparent polyacrylate dielectric elastomers, the sandwich structure film endows outstanding mechanical flexibility and great stability of energy storage performance reliability as demonstrated in rigorous bending cyclic tests. This work affords a facile and scalable method that can be extended to other materials to exploit all-polymer multilayer structured capacitors with superior optical, mechanical durability, energy density and power density properties for electrical applications.
2 Experimental
2.1 Fabrication of layered polymer films
A series of sandwich structured PVDF films were cast by a layer by layer solution casting method. PVDF powder (Alfa Aesar) and polyacrylate dielectric elastomers (DEs, AR71, Zeon. Co., Japan) were respectively dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, Letai Co., China) by stirring for 4 h to form a homogeneous and stable suspension. Subsequently, a part of the PVDF suspension was cast onto the glass plate using laboratory casting equipment (MSK-AFA-L800, Hefei Kejing Materials Technology Co., Ltd.) and totally dried as an outer layer film after evaporating the solvent at 80 °C for 12 h. Then the inner layer of the DE suspension was cast on the outer layer. After that, the rest of the PVDF suspension was cast onto the DE layer as the other outer layer (see the schematic drawing in Fig. 1); finally, flexible freestanding films were peeled from the glass substrates after thermal treatment at 200 °C for 10 min followed by quenching in ice water immediately. The films were then dried at 80 °C overnight to evaporate residual water. The thickness of each layer in the sandwich-structured films can be regulated by simply controlling the concentration and scraper height. The cross-section and morphologies of the sandwich films were obtained by freeze fracture in liquid nitrogen and observed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM, Quanta 250FEG, FEI Ltd.), respectively.

2.2 Characterization
The crystal structure of pure PVDF was characterized using an X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Bruker D8-Advance) with an X-ray wavelength of 1.542 Å (Cu Kα radiation, 40 kV, and 100 mA), a 2θ diffraction angle of 10° to 60°, a rate of 15° min−1, and a step of 0.02° (Fig. S10a†). The thermal transition data of the pure PVDF film were obtained with a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) (NETZSCH DSC 214) at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 (Fig. S10b†). The optical transmittance was examined using a UV-VIS-NIR Spectrophotometer (UV-3600, Shimadzu). The mechanical properties were obtained through a material testing machine CMT 6503 (Shenzhen Suns Technology Stock Co. Ltd.) with a load cell of 50 N at a tensile speed of 2 mm min−1, and the films were cut into dumbbell shapes (the testing part with 4 mm width and about 18 μm thickness). Gold electrodes of a typical thickness of 100 nm and a diameter of 2 mm were sputtered using an auto fine coater (JFC-1600, JEOL Ltd.) on both sides of the polymer films for electrical measurements. Dielectric properties were measured using an impedance analyzer (4990A, Agilent Technologies Inc.) in a frequency range of 1 kHz to 50 MHz. The DC electrical resistivity of the films was obtained under an electric field of 10 MV m−1 using a high resistance meter (HP4339A, Hewlett Packard Ltd.) at room temperature. The D–E loops and electric breakdown strengths of the film samples were measured at 10 Hz using a ferroelectric tester (Radiant Technologies Inc.) with a limited current of 0.1 mA. The fast discharge experiment was carried out using a PK-CPR1502 test system (PolyK Technologies). The charge–discharge cycle was manipulated with a LabVIEW program. A computer aided homemade bending test system was utilized for mechanical bending tests.
3 Results and discussion
3.1 Preparation and morphology of the layered polymer films
We have fabricated a series of sandwich structured PVDF films via inserting DE central layers of different thicknesses through the layer-by-layer solution casting method. Notably, compared with the multistep extrusion blowing and zone-heated uniaxial stretching process, the solution casting technique is facile, timesaving, and cost efficient.30Fig. 1a shows a schematic illustration of the design and fabrication process of the sandwich-structured all-polymer films. Then, the corresponding solutions were poured sequentially onto a smooth glass substrate to obtain uniform sandwiched films, which were placed in a vacuum oven to accelerate the evaporation of the solvent. With our current apparatus, the as-prepared freestanding sandwiched all-polymer film has a large size (i.e. 6 × 6 cm), as shown in Fig. 1c. The transparency over the entire visible range is quantitatively depicted in Fig. S1a (ESI†). The optical transmittance over the entire visible range of 400–800 nm of the DE-1 sandwiched polymer film is about 94% and almost independent of the wavelength, which is higher than that of the commonly used transparent elastomer polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) (i.e. 90.6%) that has found a myriad of applications in optical devices.31 The sandwiched film configuration has been further characterized by low-magnification cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) measurements, as shown in Fig. 1b. Evidently, the outer layers were PVDF films and the central layer was a DE film. As evidenced by high-magnification cross-section SEM (Fig. 1d–f), tight interfaces between adjacent layers were bonded without noticeable defects such as visible pores and voids at a scale of 0.1 mm, which is believed to be due to the viscoelastic effect of DE central layers.6 The thickness of each component layer of the sandwiched all-polymer films has been further examined by high-magnification cross-sectional SEM. It has been revealed that through readily controlling the solution concentration and scraper height, the thickness of the PVDF layer is fixed in the range of 6–7 μm, while the middle layer thickness increases gradually from 3–4, 6–7 to 13–14 μm, respectively. The resulting sandwich-structured polymer films are termed DE-1 sandwich, DE-2 sandwich and DE-3 sandwich, respectively.
3.2 Frequency dependent dielectric properties of the layered polymer films
To investigate the influence of different thicknesses of the DE central layer on the dielectric performance of the all-polymer sandwiched films, a pristine PVDF film has been characterized for comparison. Fig. 2a shows the frequency dependent dielectric constant and loss of the sandwiched all-polymer films in the range from 1 kHz to 20 MHz. Obviously, the dielectric constants of the all-polymer sandwiched films decrease with increasing frequency because the dipole moments are not sufficiently mobile to displace as the frequency of the applied electric field exceeds the relaxation. It is clear that the thickness of the central DE layer plays a significant role in determining the dielectric behaviors of the sandwiched polymer films and double-decker polymer films (Fig. S3†). For the DE-1 sandwiched polymer films, the dielectric constants and loss curves display a similar variation trend to those of pure PVDF in the measured frequency range from 1 kHz to 20 MHz. The dielectric loss peak can be observed at around 10 MHz, which is attributed to the αa relaxation from the segmental motions within the amorphous phase in PVDF.32 The dielectric constant decreases modestly, i.e. from 11.2 for pristine PVDF to 10.4 for DE-1 sandwich at 1 kHz. Concurrently, a lower dielectric loss (tanδ < 0.04) than that of pure PVDF in the frequency range from 1 kHz to 100 kHz was also shown in Fig. 2b. In stark contrast, with further increasing the thickness of the DE central layer, both the dielectric constant and corresponding dielectric loss obviously decrease at high frequencies (>1 MHz) for the DE-2 and DE-3 sandwich polymer films. These results are primarily ascribed to the low dielectric constant (i.e. 4.47 at 1 kHz) and dielectric loss (i.e. 0.154 at 1 kHz) of the acrylic rubber dielectric elastomers (DEs).22,23

3.3 Capacitive energy-storage capability of the layered polymer films
The typical electric displacement–electrical field (D–E) loops of the sandwich-structured polymer films and pristine PVDF are obtained with a 10 Hz unipolar triangle signal under an applied field of 300 MV m−1 (Fig. 3a). As can be seen, pronounced enhancement in the maximum displacement with the increase of the thickness of the DE central layer is achieved, which can be further corroborated in Fig. S3.† For instance, the maximum displacement (Dm) of the DE-3 sandwiched polymer film is 11.03 μC cm−2, which is 50% higher than 7.1 μC cm−2 of pristine PVDF. As for the double-decker polymer films, the improved maximum electric displacement is also achieved even under a lower electric field (i.e. 200 MV m−1), as shown in Fig. S4.† Besides, it is of interest to note that the maximum displacement (∼9.13 μC cm−2) of the DE-1 sandwich polymer film is much larger than that of pristine PVDF (∼7.05 μC cm−2), while the remnant displacement Dr (∼1.38 μC cm−2) is only slightly changed in comparison to that of PVDF (∼1.2 μC cm−2), confirming that the sandwiched polymer film with an optimized DE thickness of 4 μm exhibits the highest difference in the displacement (Dm − Dr = 7.75 μC cm−2) at 300 MV m−1. Even at 400 MV m−1, the remnant displacement of the sandwich-structured polymer film (i.e. 1.83 μC cm−2) is slightly higher than that of neat PVDF (i.e. 1.62 μC cm−2). Compared with the increase in the ferroelectric loss, the conduction loss of the sandwich-structured film increases sharply with the electric field (Fig. S9 and S11†). Clearly, the value of the conductive loss is more than twice that of the ferroelectric loss, indicating that conductive loss plays a dominant role in the total dielectric loss of the PVDF and sandwich-structured films, as verified by the leakage current density measurements at various electric fields (Fig. 6b). Therefore, the suppression of conductive loss and leakage current is the key factor to achieve low residual polarization of the sandwich-structured film with an optimized thickness of DEs at high electric fields. Besides, the maximum displacement difference (ΔD) between pristine PVDF and DE-1 sandwich polymer films increases monotonously from 2.03 μC cm−2 to 2.97 μC cm−2 with increasing electric field, while the remnant displacement is almost insusceptible, as displayed in Fig. 3b.

(e) Characteristic breakdown strength and electric displacement of pristine PVDF and the sandwich-structured polymer films. 
Besides the electric displacement of the sandwich-structured polymer films, the breakdown strength is another key factor to evaluate the energy storage performance. The characteristic breakdown results of pristine PVDF and the sandwich-structured polymer films are analyzed using Weibull statistics as follows:33 P(E) = 1 − exp(−(E/Eb)β)(1)where P(E) is the cumulative probability of electric failure, E is the experimental breakdown strength, Eb is the characteristic breakdown strength at a cumulative failure probability of 63.2%, and β is the Weibull modulus associated with the linear regressive fit of the distribution. In the Weibull distribution, the values of the β parameter of all the sandwiched films are higher than 10, indicative of highly concentrated data distribution and a high degree of reliability. As can be seen in Fig. 3c, Eb decreases with the increase of the thickness of DE central layers, i.e., from ≈445 MV m−1 for the pure PVDF film to ≈372 MV m−1 for the DE-3 sandwich polymer film, as a result of low Eb (≈31 MV m−1) of the acrylic rubber DE.23 The Eb of the DE-1 sandwich polymer film is 438 MV m−1, confirming that the optimized thickness of the DE central layer (∼4 μm) is advantageous in maintaining the high Eb of the sandwiched films. The variation of Eb with the film structure is further verified using DC electrical resistivity as shown in Fig. 3d. Although the electric resistivity of pure DE is 2.39 × 108 Ω m, the DE-1 sandwich polymer film is found to have much improved insulating properties with an electric resistivity of 3.11 × 1010 Ω m. PVDF films with high breakdown strength are used as the insulating layers at the top and bottom of the films to suppress leakage current and avoid early breakdown as a result of the blocking effect of the interfaces between the layers, which leads to the increased path tortuosity in the electrical treeing process during breakdown.34 Meanwhile, high breakdown strength is also attributed to the robust interfaces without the presence of pores and voids owing to the viscoelastic effect of DE central layers. Fig. 3e shows the D–E loops of pristine PVDF and the sandwich-structured polymer films measured at the characteristic breakdown strength. Apparently, the maximum displacement of all sandwiched polymer films exceeds 12 μC cm−2 with the characteristic Eb, while the maximum displacement of pristine PVDF is only 9.8 μC cm−2.
Based on the above results of electric displacement and breakdown strength for the sandwich-structured polymer films, the energy storage performances have been investigated. As plotted in Fig. 4a, the energy storage capabilities of these sandwich-structured polymer films are determined from the D–E loops using a modified Sawyer-Tower circuit, where the charged energy density (U) is derived from the D–E loops by integration of the area between the charge curve and the ordinate, and the discharged energy density (Ue) is determined by the area between the discharge curve and the ordinate.35,36 Significantly enhanced charged energy densities have been observed when compared with those of pure PVDF, which is ascribed to the dramatic improvement in the maximum displacement with increasing the thickness of the DE. The most striking feature in Fig. 4b is that the DE-1 sandwich polymer films possess the highest discharged energy density of 20.9 J cm−3 at a breakdown electric field of 438 MV m−1, which corresponds to ∼30% enhancement over that of pure PVDF (15.8 J cm−3 at 445 MV m−1) and ≈900% over that of the benchmark BOPP (∼2 J cm−3 at 640 MV m−1).6 As a matter of fact, the discharged energy density achieved in the all-polymer sandwiched films, to the best of our knowledge, is one of the highest values of solution-processed polymer dielectric films reported so far.42 The highest discharged energy density of the DE-1 sandwich polymer films is attributed to the synergistic combination of the highest displacement difference of 11.01 μC cm−2 and high breakdown strength of 438 MV m−1, as shown in Fig. 3f. Although the breakdown strength of the DE-3 sandwich polymer films is limited to 373 MV m−1, the discharged energy density still reached 14.39 J cm−3, owing to the highest maximum displacement of 12.9 μC cm−2. In addition to the energy density, the charge–discharge efficiency (η = Ue/U) is another key factor of dielectric materials for energy storage capacitors, since the unreleased energy generates heat and consequently is detrimental to the performance and reliability of the capacitors.37 In comparison to pure PVDF with a η of 70%, a much higher η of 72% even under a breakdown electric field is achieved in the DE-1 sandwich polymer films. Impressively, the comprehensive energy storage capability of the DE-1 sandwich-structured polymer film is significantly superior to the current dielectric polymer films, as summarized in the comparison diagram of Fig. 4c and d. For instance, the copolymer P(VDF-HFP) and the terpolymer P(VDF-TrFE-CTFE) (80.7/11.6/7.7) deliver a discharged energy density of ca. 3.2 and 3 J cm−3 with an η of ca. 53% and 62% at 200 MV m−1, respectively.40 By contrast, a much higher discharged energy density of ca. 4.7 J cm−3 and η of ca. 73% have been obtained in the DE-1 sandwich-structured polymer film at the same electric field. At high electric fields, e.g., at 400 MV m−1, the discharged energy density of the DE-1 sandwich-structured polymer film (i.e. 17.3 J cm−3) with a η of ca. 70% is at least more than twice those of the ferroelectric copolymer P(VDF-CTFE) (i.e. 8 J cm−3) and the terpolymer P(VDF-TrFE-CTFE) (65.5/26.7/7.7) (i.e. 8.8 J cm−3).3,38

In addition to the effect of DE central layer thickness, we further investigate the influence of film configurations including single layer blends, double-decker, and sandwiched configurations on the electrical insulation and energy storage properties. Different films with identical optimized DE contents of 4–5 μm were prepared by solution casting for comparison. The single layer blend consists of PVDF and 24% volume fractions of DEs (calculated using the thickness of the component layer), which was termed “DE-1 Blends”. It is worth noting that the total thickness (∼17 μm) of all the configuration films is maintained uniform via precisely controlling the height of the scraper, as shown in Fig. 1 and S8.† The relative volume fraction of the two component phases can be calculated using the thickness of the component layer. The relative volume fractions of the two component phases in DE-1 double-decker and sandwich-structure films are 25.8% and 24.3%, respectively. The dielectric constant of the single layer blend film drops rapidly, and the corresponding dielectric loss increases with the increase of the measured frequency, as shown in Fig. 5a. The dielectric characteristics of the topologically structured polymer films have a similar variation trend to those of pure PVDF.39,40

(c) Comparison of the maximum displacement and the remnant displacement. (d) Comparison of the discharged density and the charge–discharge efficiency of PVDF and different configuration polymer films at 100 MV m−1. 
More interesting information can be obtained by comparing the energy storage properties from the D–E loops of different configuration films. Compared with the maximum displacement, i.e. 2.09 μC cm−2, of pure PVDF, enhanced maximum displacements can be attained in different configuration films through the large elastic deformation of DEs under the same applied electric field (i.e. 100 MV m−1), as observed in Fig. 5b and c. Interestingly, it is found that the remnant displacement of the sandwich-structured polymer film (i.e. 0.31 μC cm−2) is apparently lower than those of the double-decker polymer film (i.e. 0.45 μC cm−2) and the reverse sandwich-structured film (i.e. 1.28 μC cm−2), thus resulting in a higher discharged energy density of 1.2 J cm−3. For the single-layered and reverse sandwich-structured films, high remnant displacement and energy loss gave rise to deteriorated discharged energy densities and η, as shown in Fig. 5d. Since η is decided by the ratio of Uevs. U, the improvement in η of the sandwich-structured polymer film is a consequence of the reduction in energy loss (U − Ue). For ferroelectric materials, the energy loss includes conductive loss and ferroelectric loss,41 where conductive loss is decided by the conductivity and leakage current and the ferroelectric loss arises from polarization hysteresis.
To investigate the energy loss mechanisms in different configuration films, the conductive loss is deduced from the D–E loops with the assumption that the measured displacement at zero field (DE=0) comes mainly from the leakage current, given that the ferroelectric films in this investigation contain insignificant contents of the polar phase.42 The effective conductivity in a charge–discharge process can be derived using the following equation:36 DE=0 = 0.5σeffEmaxT(2)where T is the period of the applied field, T = 1/f = 1/10 = 0.1 in the current case. Emax is the applied electric field, Emax = 100 MV m−1 in the current case. The conductive loss can be determined from the calculated conductivity, and the ferroelectric loss can be subtracted from the total energy loss to give the conduction loss. Fig. 6a shows a comparison the ferroelectric loss and conductive loss of the different configuration films at 100 MV m−1. It is found that the ferroelectric and conduction losses of the single layered film (i.e. 9.2% and 82.4%) and the reverse sandwich-structured film (i.e. 7.3% and 54.2%) are much higher than those of the topological structure polymer films (i.e. 5.6% and 14.2%). It is important to note that conductive loss far surpasses ferroelectric loss, indicating that conductive loss plays a dominant role in the total dielectric loss of the sandwiched film. Obviously, the lowest conductive loss in the sandwiched film has been obtained, thus leading to its highest energy efficiency of 80%, as further verified by the leakage current density measurements of different configuration films at various electric fields as shown in Fig. 6b.

3.4 Fast-discharge capability and mechanical reliability of the layered polymer films
Fast-discharge capability (i.e. power density) is another important parameter in the evaluation of the performance of energy storage devices.43 A high-speed capacitor discharge circuit was designed and employed to measure the discharge rate at identical RC (resistor–capacitor) time constants, in which samples are charged at 100 MV m−1 followed by discharging across a 100 kΩ resistor. The experimental discharge time, τ0.9, is defined as the time to discharge 90% of the energy into the load. As expected, the discharge rate of the sandwich-structure film is faster than that of commercial BOPP (about 10.4 vs. 16.9 μs) (Fig. 7a). Importantly, the released energy density of the sandwiched film (0.95 J cm−3) is more than 4 times larger than that of commercial BOPP (0.17 J cm−3). With increasing the charged electric field, much improved released energy densities of the sandwiched film (e.g. 8.13 J cm−3 at 300 MV m−1) are obtained, which is consistent with the results of D–E loops (Fig. 4b), as shown in Fig. 7b. Accordingly, the sandwich-structured film shows a superior power density of 0.09 MW cm−3 that is more than nine times that of BOPP (0.01 MW cm−3), as shown in Fig. S5.† Moreover, the cyclic fast discharge experiments were conducted under an applied field of 100 MV m−1 to examine the stability of polymer dielectrics on continuous operation at high electric fields. It can be seen clearly from Fig. 7c and d that the sandwiched film displays no sign of degradation over 50000 cycles of charge–discharge straight (i.e., a 55 h continuous operation) and the variation of discharged energy density is less than 3% in comparison to the energy density measured in the first cycle, indicating its great cycling performance and stability.

For practical applications, such as wound film capacitor cells, the mechanical properties and bendability of the films have to be studied.1 As shown in the results of mechanical tensile testing (Fig. S1b†), the addition of the DE central layer greatly improves the mechanical properties, e.g. the tensile strain of the sandwich polymer films is found to be more independent of tensile stress than pristine PVDF. The elongation at break has been found to increase from 15.43% for PVDF to 41.98% for the DE-1 sandwich polymer films. The breakdown strengths of pristine PVDF and the DE-1 sandwich polymer films were detected to be 24.19 and 21.67 MPa, respectively. We next conduct consecutive and rigorous bending tests on the sandwich films with a thickness of 17 μm to further investigate the mechanical flexibility and reliability, in which we bend and unbend the DE-1 sandwiched film strip repeatedly for 20000 rounds straight, and each round is programmed to be accomplished in 5 seconds (Fig. 8a–c). The dielectric stability of the bending films was investigated by studying the frequency dependent dielectric properties at room temperature. The bended sample shows almost the same dielectric properties as the original film (Fig. 8d). The high-electric-field energy storage performance after bending was studied by conducting charge–discharge experiments at various electric fields (Fig. S6†). It is evident that continuous bending did not affect the energy storage capability, as shown in Fig. 8e. From the electron microscope images (Fig. S7†), no detectable cracks or flaws after bending were found in the interfaces, demonstrating the superior stability and reliability of the energy storage properties of the sandwiched film.

4 Conclusions
In summary, the sandwich-structured polymer film with an optimized thickness of the interlayer endows a greatly enhanced electric displacement of 11.01 μC cm−2 and is capable of delivering an ultrahigh energy density of 20.92 J cm−3 that surpasses the energy densities ever reported in the PVDF-based copolymers and terpolymers. More notably, the optimized sandwiched film possesses an outstanding discharged efficiency of 72% even at an electric field close to its breakdown strength (i.e. 438 MV m−1). It is revealed that the designed layered structure with multiple interfaces exhibits superior energy storage performance by efficiently suppressing energy loss and leakage current in comparison to other film configurations including traditional single layer blend and double-decker films. Moreover, the film shows superior charge–discharge cycling performance and a power density of 0.09 MW cm−3 with an ultra-fast discharge speed of 10.4 μs, which are more than nine times greater than those of the benchmark BOPP with a power density of 0.01 MW cm−3 and a discharge speed of 16.9 μs. In addition, the sandwich-structured films possess excellent mechanical flexibility and cycling durability, e.g. ∼98% capacity retention after 20000 bending cycles. This work suggests that the spatial organization of organic DEs into layered structures affords a viable approach to high-performance flexible electrostatic capacitor materials.
