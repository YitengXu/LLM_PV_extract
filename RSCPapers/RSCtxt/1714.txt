    , Accepted 11th January 2023First published on 13th January 2023AbstractSeeking new methods to modulate the structure of metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) for diverse applications, particularly for water splitting, is intensively urgent but challenging. Herein, a simple hydrothermal method employing HCl as the modulator is developed to synthesize a series of NiFe-MOF-n/NF. The amount of HCl modulator not only changes the elemental composition and crystal structure but also modulates the electronic structure of NiFe-MOF-n/NF, thus improving intrinsic activity. Owing to the synergetic interactions between Ni and Fe atoms, free-standing feature, the optimized NiFe-MOF-2/NF yields excellent OER activity with overpotentials of 209 and 260 mV at 10 and 100 mA cm−2, respectively, a small Tafel slope of 36.4 mV dec−1 and excellent OER stability for 24 h at 100 mA cm−2 in 1 M KOH. This demonstrates that NiFe-MOF-2/NF are in situ converted into metal oxide/oxyhydroxide after OER, thereby serving as the real active sites. This study offers a feasible way to fabricate low-cost, efficient MOF-based electrocatalysts.
1 Introduction
With the increasing environmental pollution and growing energy crisis, tremendous efforts have been devoted to exploring clean regenerative energy sources to substitute conventional fossil fuels.1 Hydrogen has been considered a promising energy carrier owing to its zero-carbon emission, high gravimetric energy density and recyclability. Among various hydrogen production approaches, electrochemical water splitting driven by electric power (e.g., solar and wind) is viewed as a high-efficiency route, which is due to the integrated advantages of a high-purity product, zero CO2 emission and feasibility of large-scale production.2,3 However, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) limits the overall efficiency of water splitting because of its sluggish kinetics, including four-electron transfer steps and oxygen–oxygen bond formation.4 Actually, OER is a crucial half-reaction in diverse energy conversion and storage devices, such as metal–air batteries, water splitting and fuel cells. Although noble-metal-based catalysts (e.g., IrO2 and RuO2) have been regarded as highly efficient OER catalysts, the high cost and scarcity of these catalysts limit their industrial-grade applications.5 Therefore, substantial efforts have been made to explore earth-abundant, efficient and low-cost OER catalysts, such as layered double hydroxides (LDH), transition phosphides, nitrides, selenides, oxides and sulfides, MOFs and their derivatives.6,7
Benefitting from their high porosity, large specific surface areas, abundant unsaturated metal sites and structural diversity in metal centers and organic linkers, MOFs have attracted considerable attention for energy-related applications, such as water splitting, batteries and supercapacitors.8 However, most pristine MOFs are obtained in powder form, and they usually exhibit low electrical conductivity9,10 and slow mass permeability, thus severely limiting the OER performance. To solve this issue, extensive efforts have been devoted to exploring efficient MOF-based electrocatalysts. One promising strategy is to use MOFs as precursors/templates to prepare MOF-derived oxides, phosphides, chalcogenides and nitrides through thermal pyrolysis at high temperatures under an inert atmosphere.11,12 Unfortunately, the pyrolysis strategy inevitably leads to the collapse of the MOF structure and the loss of organic ligands, which decrease the number of active sites and release toxic gas. Moreover, the pyrolysis process requires multiple synthesis steps, including high energy and time consumption. In addition, most MOF-derived electrocatalysts and MOFs are in powder forms, and additional polymeric binders are necessary to immobilize these electrocatalysts on a conductive substrate, which blocks active sites and increases interface resistance, thus leading to degraded electrocatalytic activity and stability.13 In this regard, direct growth of MOFs on the current collectors (Ni foam, carbon cloth, Cu foam, NiFe alloy foam and glass-carbon electrodes) increases electrical conductivity.14,15 Furthermore, the synergistic effects between MOFs and current collectors can help to boost the OER activity.16 Another strategy is to directly use MOFs as electrocatalysts; based on the tunable characteristics of MOFs, the most feasible methods, such as ultrasonication exfoliation,17 metal node engineering,18 lattice strain engineering19 and missing linkers engineering,20 have been applied to tune the morphology and regulate the electronic structure, thus improving the conductivity and intrinsic activity of MOFs.
Moreover, numerous studies demonstrated that Fe incorporation/doping can effectively enhance the OER activity of Ni and Co-based electrocatalysts in an alkaline medium.21 This unique Fe effect is not only discovered in nickel- or cobalt-based oxides, sulfides, phosphides, hydroxides and selenides but also in nickel- or cobalt-based MOFs. Despite the debate on the real active sites, numerous catalysts, especially NiFe-based MOF, have been developed based on the Fe effect. However, the preparation process for some NiFe-based MOFs is complicated and involves multiple steps, and the OER activity and stability of some NiFe-based MOFs are expected to improve further. Hence, it is extremely desirable yet challenging to explore an efficient and simple method for synthesizing NiFe-based MOFs with high activity and durability for OER. Several previous reports have pointed out that an appropriate amount of added specific acid22–24 or base25 could regulate the deprotonation of the organic linker and nucleation rate during the synthesis process, thus modulating the structure and properties of MOFs. Jiang et al. systematically studied the influence of HCl modulator on the crystal structure and photocatalytic activity of MIL-53.23 However, the potential relationship between the amount of HCl modulator and the elemental composition, crystal structure, and oxygen evolution activity of NiFe-based MOFs has not been reported before.
Herein, we report a simple hydrothermal method using HCl as the modulator to design a series of NiFe-MOF-n/NF for water oxidation catalysis. During the hydrothermal process, Ni2+ released from NF under HCl and added to Fe salt was coordinated by terephthalate anions to generate NiFe-MOF on the surface of the NF. HCl is utilized as a modulator to control the hydrolysis of salt and the deprotonation of organic ligand.23 Thus, the elemental composition, crystal structure and OER performance of NiFe-MOFs are regulated by the amount of HCl. Benefiting from the synergistic effect between Ni and Fe atoms and the self-standing feature, the optimized NiFe-MOF-2/NF exhibits excellent alkaline OER activity with overpotentials of 209 and 260 mV to deliver current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm−2, respectively, and a low Tafel slope of 36.4 mV dec−1. In addition, the optimized sample exhibits remarkable stability at 100 mA cm−2 for at least 24 h without distinguishable activity degradation. Moreover, structural investigation reveals that NiFe-MOF was transformed into metal oxide/oxyhydroxide, which is the true active species during the OER process. This study offers an opportunity to understand the intrinsic OER catalytic activity of MOF-based catalysts and opens up more opportunities for the utilization of MOFs in energy conversion.
2 Experimental section
2.1 Chemicals
FeSO4·7H2O, terephthalic acid (1,4-H2BDC), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), and NiCl2·6H2O were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd (Shanghai, China). RuO2 was purchased from Macklin Reagent Co., Ltd. Ni foam (NF) was purchased from Shenzhen Kejing Star Technology Co., Ltd. Carbon cloth (CC) was provided by Shanghai Hesen Electric Co., Ltd. Carbon fiber paper (CFP) was obtained from Shanghai Chuxi Industry Co., Ltd. Prior to the synthesis, NF was carefully washed with 3 M HCl for 15 min and cleaned subsequently with acetone, ethanol and distilled water several times. The CC and CFP were treated with concentrated HNO3 for 1 h and then washed ultrasonically with ethanol and water in sequence. Deionized water (18.2 MΩ·cm at 25 °C) was supplied by a laboratory water purification system.
2.2 Synthesis of NiFe-MOF-NF electrode
0.213 mmol of NiCl2·6H2O, 0.267 mmol of FeSO4·7H2O and 0.48 mmol of 1,4-BDC were dissolved in a mixed solution containing 10.5 mL of DMF, 750 μL ethanol and 750 μL of deionized water under continuous magnetic stirring for 15 min at room temperature. Subsequently, the mixed solution together with a piece of pretreated NF was transformed in a Teflon lined stainless autoclave (25 mL) and maintained at 120 °C for 12 h. After the reaction, the obtained electrode was washed three times with water and ethanol and dried naturally at room temperature.
2.3 Synthesis of Fe-MOF/NF and Ni-MOF/NF electrode
The preparation of Fe-MOF/NF and Ni-MOF/NF was similar to NiFe-MOF-NF, except that 0.213 mmol NiCl2·6H2O and 0.267 mmol FeSO4·7H2O were replaced with 0.48 mmol FeSO4·7H2O or 0.48 mmol NiCl2·6H2O for Fe-MOF/NF or Ni-MOF/NF, respectively.
2.4 Synthesis of NiFe-MOF-n/NF electrodes
The synthetic procedure of NiFe-MOF-NF was employed for the preparation of NiFe-MOF-n/NF except for adding a different volume of HCl aqueous solution (5 M), and the total volume of HCl aqueous solution and deionized water was maintained at 750 μL. The volumes of added HCl aqueous solution were 96, 192, 288, 384, 480, 576 and 672 μL. The finally obtained samples were denoted by NiFe-MOF-1/NF, NiFe-MOF-2/NF, NiFe-MOF-3/NF, NiFe-MOF-4/NF, NiFe-MOF-5/NF, NiFe-MOF-6/NF and NiFe-MOF-7/NF.
2.5 Synthesis of NiFe-MOF-2 powder/substrates and RuO2/NF
The catalyst suspension was prepared as follows: 5 mg of NiFe-MOF-2 powder collected from the bottom of the autoclave was dispersed in a mixed solution containing water (0.7 mL), ethanol (0.2 mL) and Nafion solution (5%, 100 μL) with ultrasonic treatment for 1 h to generate a homogeneous ink.15 Subsequently, 100 μL of the suspension was transferred onto the surface of NF, CC and CFP (1 × 1 cm2) and then dried in an ambient environment, with a catalyst loading of 0.5 mg cm−2. The resulting products were named NiFe-MOF-2 powder@NF, NiFe-MOF-2 powder@CC and NiFe-MOF-2 powder@CFP, respectively. RuO2/NF electrode was obtained by applying a similar procedure using 5 mg RuO2 instead of NiFe-MOF-2 powder.
2.6 Characterizations
Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were performed on a Rigaku D/MAX 2400 diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5405 Å) at a scan speed of 2° min−1. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images and the corresponding energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) were obtained using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, Hitachi S-4800) operating at 20 kV. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM), EDX elemental mapping and selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns were carried out using a Field Emission Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM FEI, Tecnai G2 F30) with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were recorded using a Thermo Escalab 250 Xi XPS calibrated by a C 1s line at 284.8 eV. Raman spectra were obtained using an iHR550 Raman spectrophotometer (Horiba, France). Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy was obtained using a Bruker Verte-80 spectrometer.
2.7 Electrochemical measurements
All electrochemical tests were conducted on an electrochemical workstation (CHI 660E) in a three-electrode system with the obtained electrode (1 × 1 cm2) as the working electrode, a graphite rod as the counter and Hg/HgO (1 M KOH) as the reference electrode. An N2-saturated 1 M KOH aqueous solution was employed as an electrolyte. The as-prepared catalysts were activated using a cyclic voltammetry (CV) test in the voltage range of 0.2–1.0 V versus RHE at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 for several times until a stable state is obtained. Then, the polarization curves were conducted by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) at 0.2 mV s−1 with 95% iR compensation. All potentials versus Hg/HgO were referenced to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) based on the following equation: E(RHE) = E(Hg/HgO) + 0.921 V. Tafel slopes were determined by plotting overpotential against log (current density). The electrochemical double-layer capacitance (Cdl) of working electrodes was estimated using CV measurements in no faradaic potential region (−0.05–0.05 V vs. Hg/HgO) at various scan rates (40, 60, 80, 100, 120 and 140 mV s−1). The charging current density differences (Δj = janodic − jcathodic) at 0 V vs. Hg/HgO were plotted against sweep rates; the resulting slope is twice the Cdl. Then, the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) is calculated using the following equation: ECSA = Cdl/Cs, where Cs = 25 mF cm−2.26 The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was measured at 1.48 V vs. RHE with a frequency from 100 kHz to 0.01 Hz. Chronopotentiometric (CP) measurement was performed at a current density of 100 mA cm−2 without iR compensation to evaluate the stability of the working electrode.
3 Results and discussion
NiFe-MOF-n/NF was synthesized by applying an in situ growth method on nickel foam, as depicted in Fig. 1. Specifically, nickel foam was employed as a substrate and nickel source. A certain amount of FeSO4·7H2O and 1,4-BDC were dispersed in the mixed solution containing DMF, ethanol and hydrochloric acid. The released Ni2+ from NF and Fe2+ coordinate with organic ligands to obtain NiFe-MOF-n/NF, where n is the volume of added hydrochloric acid. For comparison, Fe-MOF/NF, Ni-MOF/NF and NiFe-MOF-NF were fabricated by the same synthesis route without adding hydrochloric acid.

XRD was utilized to investigate the crystalline phase of the as-prepared products. Fig. 2a, Fig. S1 and S2† show the XRD patterns of sample powders collected from the bottom of the autoclave. The characteristic diffraction peaks of Fe-MOF/NF, NiFe-MOF-1/NF and NiFe-MOF-2/NF are indexed to MIL-53(Fe)27 and Fe(BDC)(DMF).28 However, the diffraction peaks weaken as the dosage of HCl increases, which corresponds to Fe(BDC)(DMF). As the dosage of HCl increases, the diffraction peaks of obtained NiFe-MOF-n/NF (n = 3, 4, 5, 6, 7) (Fig. S1†) agree well with the simulated pattern XRD pattern of MIL-101(Cr), confirming the successful synthesis of MIL-101(NiFe).29 NF etched with H+ in a mixed solution and the released Ni2+ ions would coordinate with organic ligands to form NiFe-MOFs on the surface of NF. Moreover, the hydrolysis of metal ions is relatively slow owing to the added HCl. In addition, adding HCl inhibits the deprotonation of H2BDC and thus regulating the nucleation rate of MOFs and finally changing the structure of MOFs.23,30 The phenomenon agrees with the reported MOFs in previous studies.23,27

The structures of the obtained samples were investigated using SEM and TEM. As shown in Fig. 2b, Fe-MOF/NF presents a dried beancurd stick-like microstructure that comprises nanosheets stacking with each other. The SEM images of Ni-MOF/NF exhibit a similar flower-like and microsphere hierarchical structure that is constructed by wrinkled nanosheets (Fig. S3a and b†). When nickel and iron sources were added into the initial solution for hydrothermal synthesis, the obtained NiFe-MOF-NF displayed a spindle-like morphology with diameters of 1 μm (Fig. S3c and d†). As for the series of NiFe-MOF-n/NF (n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7), many microspheres adhered to the surface of the NF (Fig. 2c, d and Fig. S4†). Additionally, the SEM-EDS spectrum (Fig. S5†) indicates the coexistence of Ni, Fe, C and O elements in NiFe-MOF-2/NF powders and the atomic ratio of Ni:Fe:C:O is 4.85:5.91:44.53:44.71. ICP suggests that the molar ratio of Ni:Fe in NiFe-MOF-2/NF is about 1:1.25, which is close to the SEM-EDS results. The TEM image (Fig. 3a and b) further validates the microsphere structure of NiFe-MOF-2/NF powders. However, it is difficult to acquire lattice fringes and diffraction spots in HRTEM analysis and the selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) (Fig. 3c) owing to the high electron beam sensitivity of the MOFs.31,32 The dark-field scanning TEM and EDS elemental mapping (Fig. 3d) reveal the homogeneous distribution of Ni, Fe, C and O in NiFe-MOF-2/NF powders, which agrees with the SEM-EDS results.

The FT-IR spectrum was employed to characterize the coordination between organic ligands and metal ions/nodes.33 For the FTIR spectra of NiFe-MOF-2/NF (Fig. S6†), the broad bands between 3070 cm−1 and 3450 cm−1 can be attributed to the stretching vibrations of O–H.34 The bands at 1573, 1381 and 747 cm−1 are attributed to asymmetric and symmetric vibrations of the carboxyl groups, and C–H bending vibrations of the benzene rings, respectively.35,36 The peak at 525 cm−1 corresponds to Ni–O/Fe–O vibrations.35 The asymmetric vibrations of the carboxyl groups at 1677 cm−1 for pure 1,4-BDC is red shifted to 1573 cm−1 for NiFe-MOF-2/NF, suggesting the coordination interaction between metallic centers and the ligand.37 In addition, the Raman spectra of NiFe-MOF-2/NF are shown in Fig. S7.† The characteristic Raman bands at 630, 810 and 860 cm−1 can be assigned to C–H out-of-plane deformation vibrations of the benzene ring, and the peak at 1178 cm−1 corresponds to C–H in-plane deformation vibrations of the benzene ring.38–40 The peaks at 1420 and 1606 cm−1 correspond to out-of- and in-plane stretching modes of the carboxylate group, respectively.39,40 Moreover, the peaks at 1137 cm−1 should be assigned to a deformation mode including a C–C stretching mode along with the carboxylate group.39
XPS was utilized to elucidate the elemental composition and valence state of Fe-MOF/NF, Ni-MOF/NF and NiFe-MOF-2/NF (Fig. 4). The full survey spectrum of NiFe-MOF-2/NF clearly reveals the presence of Ni, Fe, C and O elements, which agrees with the EDS spectrum (Fig. 4a). For the spectra of O 1s (Fig. 4b), NiFe-MOF-2/NF exhibits three main peaks, marked as O1 (533.2 eV), O2 (531.8 eV) and O3 (530.9 eV), which correspond to surface adsorbed water, carboxylate groups of the organic ligands41 and M–O (Fe–O or Ni–O) bonds, respectively.38,42 The Fe XPS spectrum of NiFe-MOF-2/NF (Fig. 4c) exhibits two peaks at 712.3 and 725.5 eV assigned to Fe3+ 2p3/2 and Fe3+ 2p1/2, respectively, implying the presence of Fe3+ in NiFe-MOF-2/NF electrodes.43,44 In the Ni 2p region of NiFe-MOF-2/NF (Fig. 4d), two major peaks at 873.9 and 856.1 eV are indexed to Ni 2p1/2 and Ni 2p3/2, respectively.45,46 In addition, two weak peaks at 857.6 and 875.6 eV are attributed to Ni–OH between Ni2+ and the hydroxyl group, respectively.47 It is noteworthy that the Ni2+ peaks of NiFe-MOF-2/NF are shifted to higher binding energy compared with that of Ni-MOF/NF. Furthermore, the Fe3+ peaks of NiFe-MOF-2/NF are positively shifted to higher binding energy compared with that of Fe-MOF/NF. According to previous reports,15,21 such shifts are probably caused by the partial electron transfer between Ni2+ and Fe3+, which indicates the synergistic effects between Ni and Fe atoms in NiFe-MOF-2/NF, therefore enhancing the catalytic activity for OER.

The electrocatalytic OER performance of the series of NiFe-MOF-n/NF was evaluated in N2-saturated 1 M KOH solution using a typical three-electrode system. As illustrated in Fig. 5a and Fig. S8,† NiFe-MOF-2/NF exhibited superior OER activity and required an overpotential of 209 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm−2, which is much smaller than those of NiFe-MOF-1/NF (228 mV), NiFe-MOF-3/NF (224 mV), NiFe-MOF-5/NF (220 mV) NiFe-MOF-6/NF (232 mV) and NiFe-MOF-7/NF (247 mV), and very close to NiFe-MOF-4/NF (206 mV). In addition, to achieve a higher current density of 100 mA cm−2, the overpotential of NiFe-MOF-2/NF is 260 mV, which is lower than those of NiFe-MOF-1/NF (288 mV), NiFe-MOF-5/NF (277 mV), NiFe-MOF-6/NF (318 mV) and NiFe-MOF-7/NF (307 mV), and very close to NiFe-MOF-3/NF (260 mV) and NiFe-MOF-4/NF (264 mV). Furthermore, at a fixed potential of 1.5 V versus RHE, NiFe-MOF-2/NF achieves a high current density of 146 mA cm−2, which is much higher than those of NiFe-MOF-3/NF (137 mA cm−2) and NiFe-MOF-4/NF (120 mA cm−2). In addition, the OER kinetic process of the electrocatalysts was examined by the Tafel slopes derived from LSV curves at low overpotentials, as depicted in Fig. 5b. The Tafel slope of NiFe-MOF-2/NF is 36.4 mV dec−1, which is close to those of NiFe-MOF-3/NF (36.9 mV dec−1), NiFe-MOF-4/NF (36 mV dec−1), NiFe-MOF-5/NF (38.3 mV dec−1), NiFe-MOF-6/NF (38.9 mV dec−1) and Fe-MOF/NF (39 mV dec−1), and smaller than those of NiFe-MOF-7/NF (55.7 mV dec−1) and Ni-MOF/NF (56 mV dec−1), suggesting their fast OER kinetics. In addition, the polarization curves of the catalysts were further normalized to ECSA (Fig. S10†). NiFe-MOF-2/NF has the lowest overpotential among the NiFe-MOF-n/NF (n = 1–7), confirming the highest intrinsic activity of NiFe-MOF-2/NF. Hence, NiFe-MOF-2/NF was selected for a detailed study that showed optimal OER performance.

For comparison, the OER activity of NiFe-MOF-2/NF powder loading on various substrates was investigated. Additionally, the electrocatalytic performance of the bare NF, carbon paper and carbon cloth was investigated under the same conditions (Fig. S11†). As expected, the NF, CC and CFP substrates exhibit poor OER activity. NiFe-MOF-2 powder@NF exhibits the best OER electrochemical performance among the three NiFe-MOF-2 powder@substrate samples. Therefore, NiFe-MOF-2 powder@NF was selected for further comparative study.
In Fig. 6a and b, the polarization curve of NiFe-MOF-2/NF exhibits the best OER performance compared to those of Fe-MOF/NF, Ni-MOF/NF, NiFe-MOF-NF, NiFe-MOF-2 powder@NF, RuO2/NF and NF. To achieve a current density of 10 mA cm−2, NiFe-MOF-2/NF requires an overpotential of 209 mV, which is 34, 60, 77, 97, 137 and 190 mV less than that for Fe-MOF/NF, Ni-MOF/NF, NiFe-MOF-NF, NiFe-MOF-2 powder@NF, RuO2/NF and NF. Moreover, NiFe-MOF-2/NF achieves a low overpotential of 260 mV at 100 mA cm−2, which is much smaller than those of Fe-MOF/NF (283 mV), Ni-MOF/NF (344 mV), NiFe-MOF-NF (356 mV), NiFe-MOF-2 powder@NF (389 mV), RuO2/NF (453 mV) and NF (520 mV). The OER activity of NiFe-MOF-2/NF is competitive with most of the previously reported NiFe-based catalysts (Table S1, ESI†). Although NiFe-MOF-2 powder/NF and NiFe-MOF/NF possess the same active species, the catalytic performance of NiFe-MOF-2/NF significantly outperforms those of NiFe-MOF-2 powder/NF and NiFe-MOF/NF. This phenomenon confirms that the strong adhesion of NiFe-MOF directly grown on current collectors in NiFe-MOF-2/NF is conducive to improving catalytic activity.15,48 Bimetal NiFe-MOF-2/NF shows significantly enhanced OER activity compared with Ni-MOF/NF and Fe-MOF/NF mainly owing to the synergistic effect of Ni and Fe atoms, which is confirmed by XPS tests. However, bimetal NiFe-MOF-NF has poor OER activity, even lower than that of Ni-MOF. These results imply that the HCl modulator changes the composition and crystal structure of MOFs and further regulates the electronic structure of NiFe-MOF-2/NF, thus enhancing electrocatalytic activity. Furthermore, the reaction kinetics of the series of catalysts was analysed (Fig. 6c). The Tafel slope of NiFe-MOF-2/NF is 36.4 mV dec−1, which is smaller than those of Ni-MOF/NF (56 mV dec−1), Fe-MOF/NF (39 mV dec−1), NiFe-MOF-NF (59.7 mV dec−1), NiFe-MOF-2 powder@NF (53.7 mV dec−1) and RuO2/NF (92.3 mV dec−1), suggesting a faster kinetics during the OER process.

Inset: the equivalent electrical circuit from the fitted impedance spectra; (e) charging current density differences plotted against scan rates of NiFe-MOF-2/NF, NiFe-MOF-2 powder@NF, Fe-MOF/NF, Ni-MOF/NF and NiFe-MOF-NF at 0.92 V vs. RHE; and (f) chronopotentiometric curve recorded on NiFe-MOF-2/NF at a constant current density of 100 mA cm−2. 
The EIS test was employed to study the electron transfer rate during the OER. The Nyquist plots were fitted by an equivalent circuit, as illustrated in the inset in Fig. 6d. The equivalent circuit comprises solution resistance (Rs), charge transfer resistance (Rct) and constant phase element (CPE). We point out that NiFe-MOF-2/NF, NiFe-MOF-NF, Ni-MOF/NF, Fe-MOF/NF and NiFe-MOF powder/NF electrodes have similar solution resistance (Rs). This is because they possessed the same current collector and were directly grown on the same NF substrate, except for the NiFe-MOF powder/NF electrode, where Nafion employed a polymeric binder. NiFe-MOF-2/NF has the smallest charge-transfer resistance compared to other catalysts, indicating better OER kinetics, which agrees with the results of LSV.
To further uncover the intrinsic OER activity of NiFe-MOF-2/NF, the electrochemical surface areas of the catalysts were evaluated by calculating the Cdl using the CV method. As illustrated in Fig. 6e and Fig. S15,† the Cdl value of NiFe-MOF-2/NF is 1.56 mF cm−2, which is larger than those of NiFe-MOF-NF (1.25 mF cm−2), Fe-MOF/NF (1.5 mF cm−2), Ni-MOF/NF (1.43 mF cm−2), and NiFe-MOF-2 powder@NF (1.32 mF cm−2). This indicates that NiFe-MOF-2/NF possesses more exposed active sites, which contributes to the enhancement of OER activity. Moreover, the polarization curves of the catalysts were further normalized to ECSA (Fig. S16†). NiFe-MOF-2/NF remain exhibits the lowest overpotential, confirming the highest intrinsic activity of NiFe-MOF-2/NF.49,50
The stability of NiFe-MOF-2/NF was assessed by chronopotentiometry at 100 mA cm−2 (Fig. 6f). Even after a reaction for over 24 h, the overpotential for NiFe-MOF-2/NF to maintain 100 mA cm−2 only increases by 3 mV. Furthermore, the LSV curve exhibits a slight potential shift compared to the initial one, revealing the excellent stability of NiFe-MOF-2/NF (Fig. S17†). In addition, to reveal the change in the crystal structure, the morphology and composition of NiFe-MOF-2/NF after OER tests, XRD, SEM, HRTEM, Raman, FTIR and XPS measurements were performed. As demonstrated in Fig. S18a,† the XRD pattern reveals the formation of NiFe-LDH (PDF no. 49-0188) after OER tests.49 SEM results (Fig. S18b†) show that NiFe-MOF-2/NF maintains the pristine morphology, but the surface becomes rougher, indicating that some new species are generated. The TEM image shown in Fig. S18c† mainly exhibits numerous pores owing to the structural collapse during the oxidation process. The HRTEM image (Fig. S18d†) displays the characteristic lattice fringe of 0.26 nm attributed to the (012) plane of NiFe-LDH, which agrees with the XRD data.49 FT-IR spectra (Fig. S19†) reveal that the bands at 1573, 1381 and 747 cm−1 are associated with asymmetric and symmetric vibrations of the carboxyl groups, and C–H bending vibrations of the benzene rings disappear after the OER process. These results could be mainly attributed to the collapse of the structure in MOFs together with the degradation of organic ligands under OER reaction conditions.35 Furthermore, Raman characterization was implemented to confirm in situ generated active species (Fig. S20†). Raman peaks at 477 and 556 cm−1 can be attributed to NiOOH.51 The Fe 2p spectrum in Fig. S21a† shows two peaks of Fe 2p1/2 and Fe 2p3/2 at 725.4 and 712.3 eV, respectively, which imply the presence of Fe3+.52 For the Ni 2p XPS peaks (Fig. S21b†), the peaks at 873.2 and 855.5 eV are attributed to Ni 2p1/2 and Ni 2p3/2, respectively with a binding energy separation of 17.7 eV, suggesting the presence of Ni(OH)2.53 Moreover, the peaks at 875 and 857 eV are attributed to Ni 2p1/2 and Ni 2p3/2 of Ni3+, respectively, indicating the presence of NiOOH.54 For the spectrum of O (Fig. S21c†), the peaks located at 533, 531.2 and 529.2 eV correspond to surface-adsorbed water molecules, hydroxyl groups and metal–oxygen bonds, respectively.38,55 Based on the above investigation, we conclude that NiFe-MOF-2/NF has been transformed to Ni/Fe (oxy)hydroxide, which is considered the real active site for OER. This similar phenomenon is also observed in LDH,56 metal sulfides,57 selenides,58 nitrides,59 phosphides,60 alloys51 and other MOF-based electrocatalysts.15,18,35 Based on the above characterization and OER results, the remarkable OER activity and superior stability of NiFe-MOF-2/NF can be attributed to the following merits. First, the in situ self-growth of NiFe-MOF-2/NF on an NF substrate greatly improves the stability of electrocatalysts and eliminates the utilization of polymer binder, thus reducing the charge transfer resistance and increasing the electrical conductivity of the MOF-based electrode. Second, the HCl modulator optimizes the composition and electronic structure of NiFe-MOF-2/NF, which can expose more active sites for OER and facilitate fast charge transfer, thus promoting intrinsic activity. Third, the synergistic effect between Ni and Fe efficiently tailors the electronic structure, provides abundant active sites, and promotes charge transfer.15 All these prominent advantages are favorable for OER activity.
4 Conclusions
In summary, we describe a simple hydrothermal method for fabricating NiFe-MOF-n/NF by employing HCl as a modulator. Benefiting from high electrical conductivity, the optimized electronic structure and the synergistic effects between Ni and Fe atoms, the optimized NiFe-MOF-2/NF exhibits outstanding oxygen evolution performance, achieving a current density of 10 and 100 mA cm−2 at low overpotentials of 209 and 260 mV, respectively, together with a small Tafel slope of 36.4 mV dec−1. Furthermore, the NiFe-MOF-2/NF exhibits remarkable stability for 24 h at 100 mA cm−2 without degradation. Structural characterizations revealed that MOFs undergo reconstruction during the OER process to form metal oxide/oxyhydroxide, which is regarded as an active site for OER. This study paves the way to fabricate highly efficient MOF-based electrocatalysts and confirms that HCl plays an essential role in the elemental composition, crystal structure and OER performance of NiFe-MOFs.
