    AbstractIn this paper, we compare the charge recombination dynamics observed in films comprising poly(3-hexylthiophene) blended with three fullerene derivatives: PCBM and two alternative pyrazolinofullerenes. Transient absorption data indicate that replacement of PCBM with either of the pyrazolinofullerene derivatives results in a transition from bimolecular to monomolecular (geminate) recombination dynamics. We show that this transition cannot be explained by a difference in interfacial energetics. However, this transition does correlate with nanomorphology data which indicate that both pyrazolinofullerenes yield a much finer phase segregation, with correspondingly smaller domain sizes, than observed with PCBM. Our results therefore provide clear evidence of the role of nanomorphology in determining the nature of recombination dynamics in such donor/acceptor blends.

Broader context
There is currently considerable interest in the development of new materials for organic photovoltaic cells. Polymer/fullerene blends exhibiting phase segregation on the nanometre length scale are attracting very widespread interest as the active layer in organic solar cells. Recombination dynamics of photogenerated charges in these blend films is a key factor limiting device performance. In this paper we show for the first time how the nature of the recombination dynamics in these blend films can be determined by blend nanomorphology. This observation is both of fundamental scientific interest and of direct relevance to those interested in the development of organic solar cells based upon organic nanostructured donor/acceptor blends.

1. Introduction
The observation of efficient photoinduced electron transfer from a semiconducting polymer to a fullerene in blend films has motivated extensive studies of the application of such films for photovoltaic solar energy conversion.1–3 For such blend films, the formation of an interpenetrating donor/acceptor network, with nanoscale phase separation (the ‘bulk heterojunction approach’), is essential to enable efficient separation of photogenerated excitons at the polymer/fullerene interface.2 Following this charge photogeneration, two alternative recombination pathways can compete with charge collection and photocurrent generation—geminate recombination of the initially generated charges at the polymer/fullerene interface4–9 and bimolecular recombination of dissociated charges during their transport to the device electrodes.10,11 We have previously shown that the extent of geminate recombination losses can be strongly dependent upon the charge separation energetics at the donor/acceptor interface.12 Furthermore, several studies have addressed the potential importance of nanomorphology, and in particular domain size, in influencing the importance of geminate versus bimolecular recombination losses.13–15 In this study we focus upon the correlation between blend nanomorphology and recombination dynamics, and show, for the first time, a transition between geminate and bimolecular recombination of photogenerated charges correlated with a change in blend nanomorphology.
For the study reported herein we employ films of polythiophenes blended with three different C60 derivatives. Our control films are based upon films of the methanofullerene, [6,6]-phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) blended with poly-3-hexylthiophene (P3HT). Annealed 1 : 1 blend films of these materials have been shown to achieve photovoltaic device efficiencies exceeding 3%.16 In such blend films, we have previously shown that charge recombination losses are dominated by bimolecular rather than geminate recombination, consistent with the favourable interfacial energetics and high degree of phase segregation. This phase segregation, resulting in domain sizes of the order of 10 nm, has been attributed to the tendency of both P3HT and PCBM to crystallise during film deposition and annealing. For the study reported herein, data for these control films are compared to blend films employing two alternative pyrazolinofullerenes (see ESI† for details), illustrated in Scheme 1 with P3HT and a derivative of P3HT (see ESI† for material synthesis and structures) which incorporates hydroxyl groups. However, we observed no difference between P3HT and the P3HT-based copolymer, implying that the added potential for hydrogen bonding between fullerenes and this polymer (i.e. the –OH group on the polymer with the range of hydrogen bonding accepting groups on the fullerene derivatives) does not play a significant role upon either morphology or electronic coupling.

2. Experimental
2.1. Experimental details for synthesis of pyrazolinofullerene C60-2 from C60-1
The synthesis of C60-1 has been published previously.17  
A solution of C60-1 (150 mg, 0.164 mmol), propylene glycol (19 mg, 0.243 mmol) and p-toluenesulfonic acid (1 drop) in cholorobenzene (150 mL) was heated at reflux under argon atmosphere for 24 h. The solvent was removed in vacuo and the residue was purified by flash chromatography on silica gel using toluene to elute compound C60-2. The solvent was removed in vacuo and further purification of the solid was achieved by centrifuging with methanol and hexane (see ESI†).

P3HT (Mn = 13 kDa., regioregularity >94.4%) was prepared by Merck Chemicals Ltd. and PCBM supplied by Selone. A derivative of P3HT (P2) was kindly supplied by Universiteit Hasselt (see ESI†).
Both pristine and blend (1 : 1 by weight) solutions were prepared using dichlorobenzene (Aldrich Supplies) and stirred for 24 hours to fully dissolve the polymer at 50 °C. All films were deposited in a clean room. Films were prepared by spin coating the solutions onto glass substrates at 1100 rpm for 90 seconds. Prior to spin coating, the substrates were sonicated in acetone and isopropanol 15 minutes successively. Devices were fabricated by firstly spin-coating a layer of PEDOT:PSS (50 nm, Baytron P, H. C. Stark GmbH) onto patterned ITO-coated glass substrates (PsiOTc Ltd., UK) and annealing these films at 200 °C. Blend films were then spin-coated on top at room temperature. Samples were then transferred to a glove box where aluminium top electrodes were deposited in a vacuum system where the devices could be annealed at 140 °C for 1 hour. J–V curves and photocurrent were both measured using Keithley 238 Source Measure Units.
2.2. Steady state absorption
Steady state absorption spectra of the P3HT:PCBM blend films were measured with a UV/vis spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, UV-1601) and emission spectra of the films were measured using a spectrofluorimeter (Horiba Jobin Yvon, Spex Fluorolog-3), both at room temperature.
2.3. Transient absorption
Transient absorption decays were measured by exciting the sample film, under a nitrogen atmosphere, with a dye laser (Photon Technology International Inc., GL-301) pumped by a nitrogen laser (Photon Technology International Inc., GL-3300). The excitation wavelength used was 500 nm, with a pump intensity of 0.7–75 µJ cm−2 and a repetition frequency of 4 Hz. A 100 W quartz halogen lamp (Bentham, IL 1) with a stabilised power supply (Bentham, 605) was used as a probe light source, with a pump wavelength of 970 nm. The probe light passing through the sample film was detected with a silicon photodiode (Hamamatsu Photonics, S1722-01). The signal from the photodiode was pre-amplified and sent to the main amplification system with an electronic band-pass filter (Costronics Electronics). The amplified signal was collected with a digital oscilloscope (Tektronics, TDS220), which was synchronised with a trigger signal of the pump laser pulse from a photodiode (Thorlabs Inc., DET210). To reduce stray light, scattered light and sample emission, two monochromators and appropriate optical cut-off filters were placed before and after the sample.
3. Results and discussion
Measurements were performed on non-annealed spin coated films of polymer:fullerene blends in a 1 : 1 ratio by weight prepared from o-dichlorobenzene solutions. Electrochemical studies determined that C60-1 and C60-2 are both stronger electron acceptors (less negative reduction potentials) than PCBM, due to the presence of the electron withdrawing nitrogen atoms in the heterocyclic ring fused to the C60 core18 (see Fig. 1). As a consequence, the energetic driving force for charge separation will be larger for C60-1 and C60-2 compared to PCBM. Following our previous study,12 we therefore expect, in terms of energetic considerations alone, replacement of PCBM with either C60-1 or C60-2 to result in lower geminate recombination losses, due to the initially formed charges having more thermal energy available to overcome their Coulomb attraction. Thus, we might expect more dissociated charges (less geminate recombination) when using C60-1 and C60-2 as electron acceptors rather than PCBM.

UV/visible absorption spectra of pristine spin-coated films of PCBM show the appearance of strong visible absorption bands not observed in dilute solution, assigned to crystallisation/aggregation of PCBM in the solid film.19 In contrast pristine films of both C60-1 and C60-2 showed only relatively weak visible light absorption, indicative of a lower tendency to form crystalline domains (Fig. 2). This reduced tendency to crystallise may be assigned to reduced flexibility (and the absence of an ester) in the chemical groups attached to the fullerene core.

Fig. 3 depicts optical microscopy and atomic force microscopy images of the blend films, for P3HT:C60-1 and P3HT:PCBM. Similar data were obtained for both P3HT:C60-1 and P3HT:C60-2 blend films. The larger crystallites observable in the P3HT:PCBM optical images have previously been assigned to PCBM crystals. The absence of such crystallites in the P3HT:C60-1 image is consistent with this fullerene's apparent reduced tendency to crystallise. Furthermore the remarkably smooth AFM image for this blend film indicates a high degree of blending and interpenetration of the P3HT and C60-1 in this blend film compared to the rougher AFM image indicative of significant phase segregation for the P3HT:PCBM control. The finer nanomorphology of the P3HT:C60-1 film is consistent with C60-1's reduced tendency to crystallise; previous studies have identified PCBM crystallisation as a key driver for P3HT:PCBM phase segregation.20,21

Photoluminescence (PL) data were collected to evaluate the efficiency of exciton quenching for the three blend films. As shown in Fig. 4, for all blend films studied herein, we observe quenching of the P3HT polymer PL by inclusion of 50 wt% of the fullerene to be >90%, indicative of efficient exciton diffusion to and quenching at the polymer/fullerene interface. However, as we have shown previously, PL quenching alone is not a reliable indicator of the generation of fully dissociated charges, due to the potential of the initially formed radical pairs to undergo geminate recombination rather than dissociation into separated charges.12 To address this issue we employed transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) to monitor the charge separation yields and recombination dynamics. We have previously employed this technique to observe power law polaron decay dynamics in polymer/fullerene bulk heterojunction on the micro- to millisecond time scales,22 and assigned such dynamics to bimolecular recombination.10,23

TAS of all the blend films shows the formation of P3HT+ radical cations with a typical absorption around 900–1000 nm. Typical spectra, observed at 50 ns, for a P3HT:C60-1 blend film are shown in Fig. 5. Consistent with literature, all such spectra exhibited spectral features characteristic of radical ion formation (e.g.P3HT+ absorption maximum at ∼960 nm24 and C60− absorption at ∼1000 nm25).
 Fig. 5  Transient absorption data collected for a 1 : 1 P3HT:C60-1 blend film under N2 atmosphere, spun coated from o-DCB at 700 rpm for 60 s. Excited at 532 nm and measured at 50 ns, using an excitation density of 40 µJ cm−2. 

Fig. 6 shows typical decay dynamics of the photoinduced absorption, monitored at the P3HT+ absorption maximum (970 nm). These decay dynamics were all oxygen independent, consistent with their assignment to polaron rather than triplet absorption. The control P3HT:PCBM film exhibited a strong, long lived ΔOD signal, obeying power law (ΔOD ∝ t−0.7, corresponding to a straight line on the log/log plot shown), typical of those we have reported previously, and assigned, as previously, to bimolecular recombination. In contrast both the P3HT:C60-1 and P3HT:C60-2 blend films exhibit a relatively weak, much shorter lived transient signal. Moreover these faster decay dynamics are not power laws, but rather monoexponentials, as evidenced by the straight line on the log/linear inset plot. This monoexponential (first order) behaviour, and much faster decay dynamics, are clear evidence that the decay dynamics of P3HT:C60-1 and P3HT:C60-2 films are dominated by monomolecular (geminate) rather than bimolecular recombination.

Inset: same blend films data on log-linear plot with monoexponential fits. Excited at 533 nm, probed at 970 nm, using an excitation density of 60 µJ cm−2 and N2 atmosphere. 
The recombination dynamics of the blend films were further investigated by excitation intensity studies. Typical data for a P3HT:C60-1 blend film are shown in Fig. 7. As expected for a first order process, the signal amplitude increases linearly with excitation density, whilst the decay dynamics are invariant. In contrast, the absorption transients for the P3HT:PCBM films (Fig. 7) showed a sub-linear increase in amplitude and faster decay dynamics, with increasing excitation density, consistent with their assignment to bimolecular recombination.

We thus conclude that replacing PCBM in P3HT/PCBM blend films with either C60-1 or C60-2 results in a transition from bimolecular to geminate recombination dynamics. More specifically, P3HT:C60-1 and P3HT:C60-2 blend films exhibit much smoother blend films indicative of a finer blend nanomorphology, reducing the blend domain size, and thus impeding the dissociation of the initially generated radical pairs into spatially uncorrelated charges.
Several theoretical modelling and device performance analyses have previously proposed a correlation between nanomorphology and geminate recombination in polymer/PCBM blend films.15,26,27 For example, studies as a function of annealing and PCBM composition have been interpreted in terms of changes in domain size influencing the efficiency of dissociation of the initially generated geminate radical pairs.13,14,28 However, the data we report herein are, we believe, the first direct observation of a transition in the observed decay dynamics from monomolecular to bimolecular induced by such a change in nanomorphology. At present we are unclear whether the geminate recombination we observe herein on 100 ns timescale corresponds to the recombination of coulombically bound radical pairs, or rather the recombination of polaron pairs which have escaped their coulomb attraction but remain physically confined by the physical size of their respective domains. In this regard we note that the initial amplitude of the polaron signals (measured at ∼10 ns) is significantly smaller for the P3HT:C60-1 and P3HT:C60-2 blends relatively to P3HT:PCBM, indicative of the presence of an additional, faster decay phase for the P3HT:C60-1 and P3HT:C60-2 blends. We note that picosecond timescale geminate recombination has been previously reported in non-annealed P3HT:PCBM blend films.29 On the other hand, geminate recombination dynamics of coulombically bound, emissive charge transfer states in polymer/polymer blends (sometimes referred to as ‘exciplexes’) have been reported to occur on the ∼50 ns timescale.13,30,31 Notwithstanding these uncertainties, it is clear from the data shown herein that blend nanomorphology can have a substantial role in minimizing geminate recombination in the organic polymer/fullerene blend films.
The study herein has focused upon the charge photogeneration process in blend films, rather than the overall process of photocurrent generation. Device studies were consistent with these charge photogeneration data. Devices fabricated from P3HT blended with either C60-1 or C60-2 exhibited negligible photocurrent generation relative to P3HT/PCBM blends (see ESI†). Therefore, as we have observed previously for both P3HT:PCBM32 and PCPDTBT:PC70BM33 blend films, we observed a correlation between our transient absorption assay of charge photogeneration and photocurrent density in devices, suggesting that charge photogeneration rather than collection is the key determinant of photocurrent density in these devices.
Conclusion
Replacement of PCBM in P3HT/PCBM blend films with either C60-1 or C60-2 results in a transition from bimolecular to geminate recombination dynamics. As we have argued above, electrochemical data strongly suggest that this transition cannot be assigned to a change in interfacial energetics (which would tend to favour reduced geminate recombination losses for C60-1 and C60-2). Rather, it appears more likely that this transition results from the pronounced change in nanomorphology between the blend films. More specifically, P3HT:C60-1 and P3HT:C60-2 blends exhibit much smoother films and thus inhibit the dissociation of the initially generated radical pairs into fully separated uncorrelated charges. This study therefore demonstrates that nanomorphology is key not only to determining the efficiency of exciton quenching and charge transport in organic bulk heterojunction solar cells, but is furthermore important in enabling the dissociation of the initially generated radical pairs.

Broader context
There is currently considerable interest in the development of new materials for organic photovoltaic cells. Polymer/fullerene blends exhibiting phase segregation on the nanometre length scale are attracting very widespread interest as the active layer in organic solar cells. Recombination dynamics of photogenerated charges in these blend films is a key factor limiting device performance. In this paper we show for the first time how the nature of the recombination dynamics in these blend films can be determined by blend nanomorphology. This observation is both of fundamental scientific interest and of direct relevance to those interested in the development of organic solar cells based upon organic nanostructured donor/acceptor blends.
