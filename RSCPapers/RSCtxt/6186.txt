    , Accepted 12th November 2012First published on 12th November 2012AbstractPorous (Co, Mn)3O4 nanowires freely standing on a Ni foam are synthesized via a template-free growth method, followed by a thermal treatment in air. The nanowires are characterized by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffractometry, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Their catalytic performance in H2O2 electroreduction is evaluated by linear scan voltammetry and chronoamperometry. Results show that a thermal treatment leads to the conversion of solid nanowires of MnCO3 + CoCO3 to porous nanowires of (Co, Mn)3O4via decomposition and reconfiguration, which is identified to be the catalytic active component for H2O2 electroreduction. Nanowires calcined at 300 °C exhibit the highest activity for H2O2 reduction and a current density of 329 mA cm−2 is obtained in 3.0 mol dm−3 KOH + 0.6 mol dm−3 H2O2 at −0.4 V (vs. Ag/AgCl, KCl). The catalytic activity of (Co, Mn)3O4 nanowires is almost twice than that of Co3O4 nanowires. The role of Mn in improving the catalytic activity is proposed and discussed.
1 Introduction
In the past few decades, the limited capacity of fossil fuels and the worsening of the environment have called for the urgent development of clean alternative energies. Therefore, environment-friendly technologies for energy supply, storage and conversion need long-term fundamental innovative research. Fuel cells have been actively investigated as an attractive alternative for efficient and environmentally harmless power generation in recent years.1–5 State-of-the-art, low-temperature fuel cell electrode catalysts for the anode and the cathode are typically based on noble metals, which have limitations for large scale applications because of their limited abundance and high cost. Recently, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) replaced oxygen as an oxidant and has been used in several types of low-temperature liquid-based fuel cells.6–11 Compared with oxygen, H2O2 is easy to handle, store and feed into a fuel cell. Above all, the electroreduction of H2O2 could use transition metal oxide as the catalyst.12,13 The replacement of noble metals with low cost transition metal oxide catalysts would alleviate the problems of cost and availability of these metals. At present, the major problem of H2O2 as an oxidant is its chemical decomposition leading to the formation of O2, which not only reduces the catalyst activity but also the utilization efficiency of H2O2. To overcome this problem, one possible solution is the use of transition metal oxides with a 1D nanostructure, in particular 1D nanowires directly grown on a substrate, as the electrode for H2O2 reduction. Nowadays, 1D nanomaterials (nanowires, nanorings, nanofibers, etc.) have been tremendously utilized in various applications, such as catalysts, electrochemical capacitors, lithium ion batteries and solar cells, because of their unique physical and chemical properties.14–21 Arrays of 1D nanowires usually possess a larger electrochemical active surface area, a higher utilization efficiency of the active materials, and a superior mass transport property.
Among several transition metal oxides reported,12,13,22,23 Co3O4 has been proposed as a promising material for H2O2 electroreduction because of its excellent electrochemical activity. Nevertheless, the high production cost and toxicity of Co are still problematic. The partial substitution of Co in Co3O4 with Mn is a widely used strategy for the reduction of the amount of the Co element because Mn is low cost, abundant and non-toxic.24–27 Several methods have been developed to synthesize Mn-substituted Co3O4 (MnxCo3−xO4).28–33 However, none of them have a 1D nanostructure.
In this work, mesoporous (Co, Mn)3O4 nanowires, free-standing on a Ni foam, were prepared via a template-free growth method and systemically characterized. The obtained electrode possesses a three-dimensional network structure with an excellent mass transport property and a large surface area per unit volume. It exhibited a much higher catalytic performance in H2O2 electroreduction than Co3O4.
2 Experimental
2.1 Preparation of (Co, Mn)3O4 nanowires standing on a Ni foam
The Ni foam (20 × 30 × 1.1 mm, 110 PPI, 320 g m−2; Changsha Lyrun Material Co., Ltd., China) was pretreated by degreasing with acetone, etching with 6.0 mol dm−3 HCl for 15 min, and rinsing with water, prior to use. In a typical synthesis, 4 mmol Co(NO)3, 4 mmol Mn(NO)3 and 10 mmol CO(NH2)2 are first dissolved in 20 cm3 H2O and the solution is stirred for 15 min in air at room temperature. The obtained homogeneous solution is then transferred into a 30 cm3 Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave. A piece of Ni foam is put into the autoclave and immersed in the solution. The autoclave is maintained at 90 °C for 10 h to allow the growth of the nanowires on the Ni foam. After that, the autoclave is cooled down to room temperature and the Ni foam is removed from the growth solution, thoroughly washed with water, dried at 60 °C, and finally calcined at temperatures between 200 and 500 °C for 4 h in air. On average, 5 mg nanowires are grown on a 1 cm2 Ni foam, weighed after calcination at 300 °C.
2.2 Characterization of (Co, Mn)3O4 nanowires
The morphology was examined by a scanning electron microscope (SEM, JEOL JSM-6480) and a transmission electron microscope (TEM, FEI Teccai G2S-Twin, Philips). The structure was analysed using an X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku TTR III) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.1514178 nm). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy with Al Kα radiation (XPS, Thermo ESCALAB 250) was used to establish the valence states of Mn and Co in the (Co, Mn)3O4 nanowires, and the binding energy scale was calibrated by the C 1s peak at 284.6 eV. Chemical bonding information on metal–oxygen and carbonate was investigated with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR, Equinos55, Bruker) using the potassium bromide pellet technique. Each FTIR spectrum was collected after 16 scans with a resolution of 0.5 cm−1. Thermogravimetric (TG) analysis was performed with a Pyris-Diamond thermal analyzer (Perkin-Elmer) in a flow of air (40 cm3 min−1) at a heating rate of 20 °C min−1 from room temperature up to 800 °C in an Al2O3 sample pan. The Co/Mn ratio was measured with an inductive coupled plasma emission spectrometer (ICP, XseriesII, Thermo Scientific).
2.3 Electrochemical measurements
The electrochemical reduction of H2O2 was measured by linear scan voltammetry (LSV) and chronoamperometry (CA) in a standard three-electrode electrochemical cell with a Ag/AgCl, KCl reference electrode and a Pt foil counter electrode using KOH as the electrolyte at room temperature (25 ± 1 °C). The reported current densities were calculated using the geometrical area of the electrode (1 cm2). All solutions were made with analytical grade chemical reagents and ultra-pure water (Milli-Q 18 MΩ cm). All potentials were referred to the saturated Ag/AgCl, KCl reference electrode. All measurements were performed at room temperature and all the electrolytes were deoxygenated by N2 bubbling.
3 Results and discussion
3.1 Characterization of (Co, Mn)3O4 nanowires
The schematic illustration of the experimental setup is shown in Fig. 1a. Fig. 1b–d show the optical image of the Ni foam at different preparation stages. The Ni foam was first cut into a 20 × 30 mm2 sheet, cleaned, polished (Fig. 1b) and then put into the Teflon reactor. After the growth of nanowires under the solution condition,34–36 a layer of reddish brown products was formed on the surface of the Ni foam (Fig. 1c). The reddish brown products turned to a black colour after calcination (Fig. 1d). The major reactions that are involved in the formation of (Co, Mn)3O4 might be as follows: CO(NH2)2 + 4H2O → H2CO3 + 2NH3·H2O(1) Co2+ + Mn2+ + 2H2CO3 + 4NH3·H2O → CoCO3 + MnCO3 + 4NH+4 + H2O(2) 3CoCO3 + 3MnCO3 + O2 → 2(Co, Mn)3O4 + 6CO2(3)

To investigate the evolution process from the Co–Mn carbonate complex precursor to the spinel structured (Co, Mn)3O4, TG, XRD, and FTIR analyses were performed.
The TG curves of the precursor (Fig. 2a) showed that the thermal decomposition process proceeds via three stages under air atmosphere. In the first stage, a 3.7% weight loss from 25 to 142 °C is observed, which can be attributed to the evaporation of the water physically adsorbed on the surface, trapped in the intercrystallite pores, and intercalated in the interlayer space.12,37 The second stage (142–300 °C) has a 4.9% weight loss, which might correspond to the decomposition of Co–Mn carbonate.38,39 The last 29.3% weight loss occurred at 300–800 °C and can be ascribed to the further decomposition of Co–Mn carbonate and crystallization of (Co, Mn)3O4. The total weight loss in domains II and III (237–800 °C) is 34.2%, which is lower than the theoretical weight loss corresponding to the departure of carbonate groups in Co–Mn carbonate together with the conversion into (Co, Mn)3O4 (38.3%). The TG results support the fact that the temperature at which Co–Mn carbonate completely transforms to (Co, Mn)3O4 should be higher than 800 °C.
 Fig. 2  Thermogravimetric profiles of the Co–Mn carbonate complex precursor (a); XRD patterns (b) and IR spectra (c) of the precursor heated at different temperatures under air atmosphere; schematic illustrations of the spinel crystal structures viewed at (311) (d). 
XRD analysis was carried out for the structural identification of the as-prepared and calcined samples. The results are shown in Fig. 2b. The standard diffraction peak of the tetragonal spinel (Co, Mn)3O4 (JCPDS Card no. 18-0408) was also included in the figure. The lattice spacing of (111) and (202) are 0.487 and 0.304 nm. The nanowires before thermal treatment exhibit a mixed structure of CoCO3 and MnCO3. After annealing at 300 °C under air atmosphere, small peaks centered at 2θ = 36.36 and 65.18° were found, which can be ascribed to the (311) and (440) plane of (Co, Mn)3O4, indicating that the (Co, Mn)3O4 phase was formed at 300 °C via the decomposition of CoCO3 and MnCO3. After annealing at 500 °C under air atmosphere for 4 h, the majority of CoCO3 and MnCO3 was converted to spinel (Co, Mn)3O4, however, a small amount of Co and Mn carbonate still remained in the sample as indicated by the existence of peaks at 24° and 41° corresponding to Co and Mn carbonate. It has been reported that the Mn1+αCo2−αO4 spinel exhibits a dual-phase structure with α in the range 0.3–0.9. It can undergo a cubic ↔ tetragonal spinel phase transformation. A single phase of cubic spinel was found for α < 0.3 and a tetragonal spinel for α > 0.9.40–42 According to our ICP results, the Co/Mn ratio in this work is 0.98, which is close to 1, so the α in our sample is ∼0.5, which indicates that our sample is a dual phase material, containing both the cubic and tetragonal phases. Its structure is different from that of MnCo2O4 and Mn3O4 (cubic spinel).
The FTIR spectra of the as-prepared and calcined samples are presented in Fig. 2c. The peaks at 1932, 863 and 730 cm−1 observed in both the as-prepared and the calcined samples (300 °C) were due to the stretching and bending vibrations of CO32−,43,44 confirming the presence of CoCO3 and MnCO3. It is consistent with the XRD results. These CO32− peaks became weaker when the annealing temperature increased to 500 °C and four new bands at 656, 612, 558 and 515 cm−1 were observed. The peaks at 656 and 612 cm−1 can be attributed to the stretching vibration of the B–O bond (Co3+–O and Mn3+–O), where B is the atom located in the octahedral position of the spinel structure (AB2O4, Fig. 2d). The peaks at 558 and 515 cm−1 can be due to the tetrahedral unit A–O bond (Co2+–O and Mn2+–O).28,45 It has been reported that the characteristic FTIR peaks for Co3O4 occurred at 661 and 571 cm−1.12,28 These peaks shifted to low wave numbers for (Co, Mn)3O4, suggesting an increase in the strength of the Co–O bond in (Co, Mn)3O4. These four peaks were also found in the sample calcined at 300 °C. So FTIR results further demonstrated that the sample before thermal treatment is mainly composed of CoCO3 and MnCO3, and calcination at 300 °C leads to a partial conversion of the carbonates to (Co, Mn)3O4. The FTIR results are consistent with those of the XRD, and both indicated that the formation of the (Co, Mn)3O4 nanowires can be ascribed to the decomposition and reconfiguration of MnCO3 and CoCO3 (eqn (3)).
To examine the morphology evolution process, SEM and TEM analyses were carried out for the samples as-prepared and calcined at different temperatures, and the results are shown in Fig. 3. As seen from Fig. 3a for the as-prepared sample, dense nanowires were formed uniformly on the skeletons of the Ni foam and pointed outwards from the Ni foam surfaces forming a relatively ordered array with a highly open 3D structure. This unique structure enables the surface of nanowires to be highly accessible to the reactants when used as an electrode for H2O2 electroreduction. The TEM image of the as-prepared nanowires (Fig. 3b) shows that the nanowires are solid cones, with diameters around 100 and 60 nm at the bottom and at the tip, respectively. Calcination resulted in obvious changes in the morphology of an individual nanowire (Fig. 3d and f), but the overall array structure was still maintained (Fig. 3c and e). After calcination, the solid nanowires were converted to porous rods, which are composed of interconnected nanoparticles, and the diameter of the nanowires decreased obviously (Fig. 3d and f), e.g. from 60–100 nm before calcination to 30–50 nm after calcination at 500 °C. These changes can be attributed to the thermal decomposition of the carbonates. Notably, when the sample was calcined at 500 °C, cracks appeared in the structure of nanowire arrays (Fig. 3e). The high-resolution TEM image for a nanoparticle from the nanowires calcinated at 500 °C (Fig. 3g) indicated that the nanoparticles are highly crystallized. The lattice space of 0.49 and 0.30 nm corresponds to the (111) and (202) planes of the spinel structured (Co, Mn)3O4, respectively. This is in good agreement with the calculated values from XRD.

In order to identify the oxidation state of Co and Mn in the (Co, Mn)3O4 sample, the XPS spectra in the Co and Mn 2p region were recorded and fitted for the samples calcined at 300 and 500 °C (Fig. 4). Shirley background was used to subtract the background.46 The binding energies of the main peak and of the satellite peak were used for the decomposition of the Mn and Co peaks. The line shape was also included in the curve fitting. In Fig. 4 the most intense 2p3/2 level was deconvolved by the Gaussian–Lorentzian fitting. It should be noted that for a spinel structure, M2+ ions locate in the A-sites (tetrahedral sites) and M3+ ions distribute in the B-sites (octahedral sites). These two sites are indistinguishable by XPS.47 It has been reported that the binding energies of Co 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 in Co3O4 are in the range 779.5–780.3 eV and 795.0–795.9 eV, respectively, with satellites occurring about 7–9 eV higher in binding energy from the main bands.47–49 For Co in the sample calcined at 300 °C (Fig. 4a), two main peaks at 780.3 and 795.5 eV were observed with two additional satellite peaks at 788.9 and 804.8 eV, which correspond to Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2, respectively. For the sample calcined at 500 °C (Fig. 4a), the main peaks of Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2 shifted to 779.7 and 795.0 eV, respectively, and their satellite peaks shifted to 786.2 and 803.0 eV, respectively. Based on the wide Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2 peaks, it is reasonable to assume that Co2+ and Co3+ species co-exist at the surface of the sample calcined at different temperatures. For Mn (Fig. 4b), both samples calcined at 300 °C and at 500 °C show two main peaks at 642.0 and 653.5 eV, 641.5 and 653.2 eV, respectively, which are in good agreement with the binding energy values associated to the co-existence of Mn2+ and Mn3+ species reported in the literature.32,50 The spin orbital splittings in the calcined samples at 300 and 500 °C are 15.3 and 15.2 eV, respectively, for Co, and 11.5 and 11.7 eV, respectively, for Mn. These values are consistent with the reported values for Co3O4 and Mn3O4.47 The M3+/M2+ ratios can be obtained from the relative intensities of the M2+ and M3+ contributions in the 2p3/2 peaks, which were deconvolved by the Gaussian–Lorentzian fitting. The binding energies of the Co3+ 2p3/2 and Co2+ 2p3/2 are 779.4 and 780.8 eV for the sample calcined at 300 °C, and 780.0 and 782.5 eV for the sample calcined at 500 °C respectively.47,48,51,52 The binding energies of the Mn2+ 2p3/2 and Mn3+ 2p3/247,53,54 are 643.8 and 641.5 eV, respectively, for the sample calcined at 300 °C, 642.9 and 641.1 eV, respectively, for the sample calcined 500 °C. From the deconvolution and fitting results, it can be estimated that the Co3+/Co2+ ratios decreased from 1.45 to 0.71 when the heating temperature was increased from 300 °C to 500 °C. On the contrary, the Mn3+/Mn2+ ratios increased from 0.73 to 1.91. This difference in the change of M3+/M2+ ratios can be explained by the easy formation of solid solutions between cobalt and manganese oxides at different calcination temperatures according to the literature.28,55,56 The XPS analysis confirmed the valence states of the metal ions.

3.2 H2O2 electroreduction by the (Co, Mn)3O4 nanowire electrode

Fig. 5 shows the influence of the calcination temperature on the catalytic activity of the (Co, Mn)3O4 nanowire electrode for H2O2 electroreduction in 3 mol dm−3 KOH + 0.4 mol dm−3 H2O2. It can be seen that the as-prepared nanowires (CoCO3 + MnCO3) showed nearly no catalytic activity for H2O2 electroreduction. After the sample was calcined at 300 °C, the electrode exhibited a significant catalytic activity for H2O2 electroreduction, and a new phase, (Co, Mn)3O4, occurred at this annealing temperature (Fig. 2 XRD and FTIR). So the catalytic activity of the sample can be attributed to the (Co, Mn)3O4 component. A further increase in the calcination temperature to higher than 300 °C resulted in a decrease in catalytic activity, even though more CoCO3 + MnCO3 decomposed to (Co, Mn)3O4. The loss of activity can be attributed to the decrease of surface area and the increase of ohmic resistance, caused by the aggregation of small particles and the cracking of the surface film (Fig. 3e and f).
 Fig. 5  Linear scan voltammograms of H2O2 electroreduction on electrodes calcined at various temperatures. The curves were measured in 3.0 mol dm−3 KOH + 0.4 mol dm−3 H2O2 at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1. 

Fig. 6 shows the dependence of the catalytic performance of (Co, Mn)3O4 nanowires on the concentration of H2O2. The limiting current significantly increased with the increase of H2O2 concentration, suggesting that the use of a high concentration of H2O2 will boost the cathode performance of fuel cells using H2O2 as the oxidant. However, we noticed that when the concentration of H2O2 exceeded 0.6 mol dm−3, O2 bubbles occurred on the catalytic surface due to the chemical decomposition of H2O2, which reduced the utilization efficiency of H2O2.
 Fig. 6  Linear scan voltammograms of H2O2 electroreduction on the electrode calcined at 300 °C. The curves were recorded in 3 mol dm−3 KOH containing different H2O2 concentrations. 

Fig. 7 shows the chronoamperometric curves for H2O2 electroreduction at various constant potentials in 3 mol dm−3 KOH + 0.6 mol dm−3 H2O2. It can be seen that the currents remain nearly constant within a 1000 s test period at −0.2 V (the kinetics control region, Fig. 6). The current decreased with the increase of reaction time at more negative potentials (mixed control region, e.g. −0.3 V and near the concentration control region, e.g. −0.4 V), which is likely caused by the depletion of H2O2 near the electrode surface. Notably, we carried out the three constant potential tests using the same electrode, and each test lasted 1000 s. So the total test time reached 3000 s. Besides, H2O2 electroreduction does not produce any poisoning species that cause catalyst poisoning. The catalytic stability mainly depends on the stability of the catalyst itself in the testing solution. Based on the chronoamperometric curves it can be concluded that the electrode has relatively good stability.
 Fig. 7  Chronoamperometric curves for H2O2 electroreduction on the electrode calcined at 300 °C. The curves were measured in 3.0 mol dm−3 KOH + 0.6 mol dm−3 H2O2 at different potentials. 
The catalytic performances of the (Co, Mn)3O4 nanowires, Co3O4 nanowires, Mn3O4 nanosheets and Co3O4 nanoparticles are compared in Table 1. The H2O2 reduction current density at −0.4 V on (Co, Mn)3O4 is almost twice that on Co3O4 nanowires and nanoparticles,12,13 three times that on Mn3O4 nanosheets, which demonstrated that the (Co, Mn)3O4 nanowires electrode exhibited much higher catalytic performance than both Co3O4 and Mn3O4 electrodes.

The mechanism for the electrochemical reduction of H2O2 with Co3O4 is not fully understood. It has been proposed that the redox couple of Co2+/Co3+ is likely responsible for the catalytic activity of the H2O2 reduction.12 The rate-determining step for H2O2 electroreduction is believed to be the O–O bond cleavage with an activation energy of 50 kcal mol−1.57,58 The enhanced electrocatalytic activity of (Co, Mn)3O4 might be attributed to the decrease in the energy barrier for the O–O bond cleavage caused by the introduction of Mn. This is because the Mn ion has a weaker electron affinity than Co and it could act as an electron donor to facilitate the reduction of H2O2. To explain this role of Mn, the possible speciation complexes between H2O2 and (Co, Mn)3O4 are depicted in Scheme 1. As can be seen, the possible interactions between H2O2 and (Co, Mn)3O4 include: (1) the interaction of two Co2+ (Scheme 1a) or two Mn2+ (Scheme 1c) with the two oxygen atoms in H2O2; (2) the interaction of one Co2+ and one Mn2+ with the two oxygen atoms in H2O2 (Scheme 1b). According to these interaction modes, the most probable mechanism can be simplified as: (4) (5) M3+ − ·OHHO· − M3+ → 2M3+ + 2OH−(6) M3+ + e− → M2+(7)
 Scheme 1  A schematic diagram depicting the mechanism for the H2O2 electrochemical reduction on (Co, Mn)3O4. 
In the first step, one molecule of H2O2 is absorbed by two M2+ atoms (eqn (4)). In the second step, the electrons transfer from M2+ to the oxygen atoms leading to the weakening of O–O bond (eqn (5)). In the third step, the O–O bond elongation and electron redistribution occur, and an OH− species is released accompanied by the increase of M2+ to M3+ (eqn (6)). In the fourth step, M3+ is reduced to M2+ by a second H2O2 molecule and this will ultimately lead to the formation of the second OH− (eqn (7)). During the overall reaction, eqn (4) and (6) are considered as the rate determining steps (RDE). Since Mn2+ (1.3) is a stronger electron donor than Co2+ (1.7),59 the reaction rate of eqn (6) is enhanced by substituting Co with Mn, however, the reaction rate of eqn (4) is decreased by replacing Co with Mn. Therefore, (Co, Mn)3O4 displayed higher catalytic activity than both Co3O4 and Mn3O4.
4 Conclusions
Arrays of (Co, Mn)3O4 nanowires were successful grown on a Ni foam via a template-free growth method. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the fabrication of (Co, Mn)3O4 nanowires on a Ni foam. The formation of (Co, Mn)3O4 nanowires is believed to proceed via the decomposition and reconfiguration of the MnCO3 and CoCO3 nanowires, which were formed on the surface of a Ni foam during the growth procedure. The thermal treatment temperature is critical for the formation of a highly active (Co, Mn)3O4 structure. A further finding of this study is that the catalytic activity of the (Co, Mn)3O4 nanowire electrode for H2O2 electroreduction is nearly twice that of Co3O4 nanowires. The enhanced catalytic activity is explained by the decrease in the energy barrier of the O–O bond cleavage caused by the introduction of Mn.
