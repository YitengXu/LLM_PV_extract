    , Accepted 3rd January 2018First published on 3rd January 2018AbstractThe charge carrier kinetics of hydrothermally treated TiO2 nanoparticles, consisting of interconnected anatase and rutile crystallographic forms, was investigated using a heterodyne transient grating technique to obtain direct evidence of the enhancement of charge separation efficiency. We found that surface recombination arising from trapped electrons was retarded, compared with that of P25 TiO2 nanoparticles, with the aid of an increase of particle interfaces. This means that the charge separation efficiency of hydrothermally treated TiO2 nanoparticles is higher than that of P25 TiO2 nanoparticles, to which the enhanced photocatalytic performance of the hydrothermally treated TiO2 nanoparticles could be attributed.
1. Introduction
TiO2 has been regarded as one of the best materials for dealing with many environmental and energy issues due to its wide range of applicability as a photocatalyst. For example, it can be used for the degradation of organic pollutants, clean fuel production through water splitting, photovoltaics and so on.1–5 One of the most important factors to determine the photocatalytic efficiency is a lifetime of photo-generated electrons and holes, which should be transported to a surface for triggering chemical reactions in competition with charge recombination. Thus, in order to improve the photocatalytic performance, it is crucial to enhance its charge separation efficiency.
One of the outcomes of the efforts on the improvement of the charge separation efficiency is the development of Degussa (Evonik) P25 (P25), one of the most famous commercial TiO2 nanoparticles, in which amorphous TiO2 and partially interconnected anatase and rutile TiO2 particles are included.6 The enhanced photocatalytic performance of P25 has been attributed to the photoexcited electrons (holes) which are transferred from rutile (anatase) to anatase (rutile) TiO2 particles, meaning that the charge separation efficiency is improved.6
There have been many attempts to go beyond the photocatalytic performance of P257–13 and one of them is a facile hydrothermal treatment of the P25 TiO2 nanoparticles (Hyd-P25).14 Ide, one of our co-authors of this study, and his co-workers reported that this method can convert the amorphous TiO2 into crystalline TiO2 in P25, permeating into empty spaces between anatase and rutile particles. They demonstrated that the particle connections were increased in Hyd-P25, which greatly contributes to the improvement of the charge transfer efficiency between anatase and rutile particles, namely, the enhancement of charge separation. They confirmed the increase of particle connections using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and conversion of amorphous TiO2 into anatase and rutile using X-ray diffraction (XRD). In addition, they examined the photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue in water by Hyd-P25 and revealed that the photocatalytic ability of Hyd-P25 was remarkably enhanced in comparison with that of P25 for this reaction.
However, even though it has been understood that the enhancement of charge separation is a prime reason for the high photocatalytic performance of Hyd-P25, its charge carrier dynamics has not been studied yet so far. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the charge carrier kinetics of Hyd-P25 to obtain the direct evidence of the enhancement of charge separation using a heterodyne transient grating (HD-TG) method in which the refractive index change induced by photo-chemical or -physical processes is monitored and is sensitive to the dipole change at the interface.15–17 We found that, indeed, the recombination rate was decreased in Hyd-P25, compared with that in P25, which means that the charge separation efficiency of Hyd-P25 is higher than that of P25.
2. Experimental
The synthesis method of Hyd-P25 was described previously.14 Briefly, P25 (Nippon Aerosil), TPA, H2O, and NH4F were mixed at a molar ratio of 1:0.8:5:0.2 in a Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave, and the mixture was treated at 443 K for 7 days. The product was washed repeatedly with water and dried. The structural and element characterizations of the sample have already been conducted and presented in the previous report.14
In order to obtain transparent films to be measured using the HD-TG method, titania nanoparticle pastes of P25 and Hyd-P25 were fabricated by adding α-terpineol and ethyl cellulose to the samples of fine grid with ethanol. P25 and Hyd-P25 pastes were used for the deposition of a transparent mesoporous TiO2 layer. It was coated on a glass slide with fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) using the doctor-blade technique and sintered at 200 °C for 45 min. A cell for the measurement was prepared by putting a cover glass plate together with a silicon rubber spacer (thickness: 0.5 mm) and the solution was inserted into the gap.
For the HD-TG measurement, the third harmonic output of a Nd:YAG (YAG) laser (355 nm, ∼1 mJ per pulse, 10 Hz, pulsewidth: 5 ns) and a semiconductor laser (638 nm) were used as pump and probe lasers, respectively. The pump laser power was adjusted not to induce a color change of the target sample from white to blue, caused by the change of the TiO2 microstructures, and the generation of Ti3+ ions.18,19 The sample was pumped by UV light irradiation from the YAG laser and the response was measured via the diffraction of the probe light. The signal was detected using a photodiode (Thorlabs, DET110, rise time: 14 ns) and amplified using a voltage amplifier (Femto, DHPVA). To eliminate the scattered pump light entering the detector, a filter for cutting 355 nm light was also placed in front of the entrance of the detector. It was monitored and recorded using an oscilloscope (Agilent, DSO8104A, 4GSa/s).
3. Results and discussion
A HD-TG response of Hyd-P25 was measured in acetonitrile that is an inactive solvent to assign each component without any perturbation from the liquid side and is presented in Fig. 1(a). In HD-TG responses, the decay of electrons and/or holes, the temperature increase due to the decay of electrons/holes and their diffusion are typically observed. However, it is very difficult to distinguish and assign each component by just observing the response due to the existence of multiple components in a single decay. Thus, in this study, in order to obtain time constants of each component, included in the response, and assign them, the MEM analysis, which gives a continuous distribution of the lifetime of discrete exponential responses by maximizing the entropy of the error between the observed and the fitting data, was employed and the amplitude of each exponential component is shown on the right side of Fig. 1 (black line: positive sign, black dotted line: negative sign). As shown in the figure, a rise component at around 10−6 s and multiple decay components in between 10−5 and 10−3 s were observed, respectively. In our former study, we observed HD-TG responses of the TiO2 film consisting of 100% anatase and successfully assigned each component by using a hole scavenger (ethanol) and an electron scavenger ((2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-piperidin-1-yl)oxyl (TEMPO)), respectively.16 According to this study, in the presence of the electron scavenger, a component included in the rising part was disappeared and assigned to the recombination dynamics arising from the electrons trapped at the surface defects because it was understood that the trapped electrons were immediately transferred to TEMPO thus the component was lost. In addition, in the presence of ethanol, surface trapped holes were scavenged from the TiO2 surface to ethanol thus the recombination arising from the trapped electrons was retarded. Thus, we can expect that the information of the recombination dynamics arising from the electrons, found in the previous study, was also included in the rising part of the response in Fig. 1.
 Fig. 1  HD-TG responses of Hyd-P25 in (a) acetonitrile and (b) TEMPO. The time constant distributions were analyzed by the MEM analysis in the range of 10−6 to 1 s (right side). 
A HD-TG response of Hyd-P25 was also measured in ACN with TEMPO that could work as an electron scavenger and presented in Fig. 1(b). In order to obtain the time constants of the response, MEM analysis was also employed and is shown on the right side of Fig. 1 as the red line. As can be seen in the responses, the rising part at around 10−6 s, appearing in the response observed in ACN, was slightly changed in the presence of TEMPO, implying that (a) component(s) corresponding to change carrier dynamics such as the recombination of the trapped electrons, included in the rising part, was affected by the electron scavenger, TEMPO. In addition, as shown on the right side of Fig. 1, it was confirmed that the faster component in the rising part (τ: 1.7 μs) was lost in the case of with TEMPO. Thus, we can assign the component in the rising part to the recombination arising from the surface trapped electrons, which is consistent with the former study.16 In addition, the component showing the largest intensity, appearing at 480 μs, was assigned to thermal diffusion, which was confirmed by grating space dependence (Fig. S1 in the ESI†). As can be seen on the right side of Fig. 1, the peak shifted (from 480 to 620 μs) by adding TEMPO, meaning that the thermal properties of the solvent were changed by adding TEMPO. It was also found that a small component appearing at 15 μs was significantly retarded to 34 μs by adding TEMPO, meaning that it is highly related to a charge carrier dynamics such as a recombination arising from trapped holes, influenced by the removal of the electrons.

Fig. 2 shows the HD-TG responses of Hyd-P25 in ACN (Fig. 2a) and ethanol, as a hole scavenger (Fig. 2b). In order to obtain the time constants of the responses, MEM analysis was also employed and is shown on the right side of Fig. 2. As can be seen in Fig. 2, it is easily noticed that the rising rate of the response, observed in ethanol, was slower than that in ACN. In addition, MEM analysis presented on the right side of Fig. 2 clearly shows the shift of the fast component (τ = 1.7 μs in ACN and 7.2 μs in ethanol, respectively). This can be attributed to the retardation of the recombination due to the removal of the holes. Namely, because the surface trapped holes were scavenged by ethanol, the trapped electrons at the surface survived longer. Thus, it was re-confirmed that the faster component at around 10−6 s in the rising part could be assigned to the recombination arising from the surface trapped electrons.
 Fig. 2  HD-TG responses of Hyd-P25 in (a) acetonitrile and (b) ethanol. The time constant distributions were analyzed by the MEM analysis in the range of 10−6 to 1 s (right side). 
In addition, the component assigned to the thermal diffusion, appearing at 480 μs, shifted from 480 μs in ACN to 300 μs in ethanol because thermal diffusion is dependent on the solvent. Also, on the right side of Fig. 2, it is also noticed that a component at 15 μs, which was retarded by adding TEMPO, was perfectly lost in the presence of ethanol. Based on the results; the retardation of the component with TEMPO and its loss in ethanol, we can conclude that this component can be assigned to the recombination arising from the surface trapped holes.
A HD-TG response of P25 was also measured in ACN to be compared with that of Hyd-P25 and both of them are presented in Fig. 3 (a: P25, b: Hyd-P25, respectively). In addition, the time constants of the responses were also obtained using MEM analysis and are presented on the right side of Fig. 3. HD-TG responses of P25 in TEMPO and ethanol are also shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). As can be seen in Fig. 3, it can be noticed that the rising rate of the response of P25 is slightly faster than that of Hyd-P25. In addition, it can also be clearly seen in the MEM analysis that the component at 0.75 μs, extracted from the response of P25, shifted to 1.7 μs in the case of Hyd-P25, implying that the recombination rate is retarded in Hyd-P25.

On the other hand, as can be seen on the right side of Fig. 3, the MEM analysis shows that the component arising from the trapped holes was accelerated by the hydrothermal treatment. This implies that the observed component originated from the trapped holes on the anatase surface and its recombination became faster due to the increase of the electrons transferred from rutile. It is well known that TiO2 is regarded as a good electron transfer layer in solar cell devices, which means that the transport and transfer abilities of the holes in TiO2 are much lower than those of electrons.20 It can be expected that a large number of holes generated in anatase were recombined before they were accumulated on the surface of rutile. In this case, we cannot guarantee that the number of holes on the surface of rutile is larger than that in anatase. In addition, according to a former study,21 the depth of the trap state in rutile is much deeper than that in anatase. Because the HD-TG method is well known as a sensitive method to observe chemical-physical phenomena, taking place on the surface, we could only observe the hole signal arising from the anatase surface, not rutile. (It should be noted that it does not mean that there are no trapped carriers on the rutile surface, transferred from anatase.) It implies that the long lifetime of the surface trapped electrons in anatase is the most critical factor for the high photocatalytic activity of Hyd-P25. This is reasonable because we already revealed in our previous study that the photocatalytic activity was not dependent primarily on the oxidation reaction in the degradation process of methylene blue, which consisted of not only oxidation processes but also changes in the molecular structure and homogeneity.22
The time constants extracted by the MEM analysis are listed in Table 1 and the time constants of P25 in TEMPO and ethanol are also listed in Table S1 (ESI†). As shown in Table 1, in both ACN and ethanol, it is very clear that the recombination rate arising from the trapped electrons in Hyd-P25 is slower than that in P25, meaning that the charge separation efficiency was improved by hydrothermal treatment.

In a photo-luminescence spectroscopic study of anatase and rutile TiO2, conducted by Li et al.,23 they found two different decay components (τ1 = ∼30 μs, τ2 = ∼3000 μs), and assigned each of them to the direct recombination between the carriers captured by oxygen vacancies and hydroxyl groups and the recombination after the trap to trap hopping process. Because the time constants we obtained are close to the former, τ1, we can conclude that the recombination process we observed corresponds to the direct recombination of trapped carriers.
Another issue is whether the small amount of F− in Hyd-P25, which was generated by the alkali source, NH4F, and detected by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy in the previous study,14 influenced the recombination kinetics of the charge carriers. Even though surface-adsorbed F− can strongly affect the charge carrier dynamics, we believe that, in this case, its effect was not so significant due to the small amount of the element.

Fig. 4 shows the charge carrier dynamics, taking place in both P25 and Hyd-P25 by photo-excitation. As can be seen in the figure, because the band gaps of both anatase and rutile are smaller than the excitation energy of 355 nm, electron–hole pairs could be generated on both anatase and rutile sides. Then, some partial photo-excited electrons in the conduction band (CB) in rutile could be transported to bulk or surface trap states and recombined with the photo-excited holes trapped at the surface. Some other electrons in the CB in rutile could be transferred to the CB in anatase and trapped in the surface or bulk states in anatase because the CB level of anatase is lower than that of rutile, which was directly probed by Kelvin probe force microscopy and spatially resolved surface photovoltage spectroscopy in the former study.6 On the other hand, the photo-excited holes generated in anatase could be either transported to the surface trap states or transferred to the valance band (VB) on the rutile side. However, as we mentioned above, it should be noticed that the transfer and transport efficiencies of holes are much lower than those of electrons. Because the hydrothermal treatment improved the charge transfer efficiency of P25 by increasing the interconnected areas between anatase and rutile, it was expected that the recombination rate could be retarded and, indeed, in this study, we successfully observed the retardation of the recombination.

4. Conclusion
We successfully observed photo-excited charge carrier dynamics of Hyd-P25 and P25 and demonstrated that the recombination arising from the trapped electrons was retarded by hydrothermal treatment, which means that the charge separation efficiency was indeed improved in Hyd-P25, compared with that in P25.
