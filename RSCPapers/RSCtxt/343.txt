    , Accepted 1st December 2013First published on 3rd December 2013AbstractDye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) is a promising solution to global energy and environmental problems because of its clean energy, low cost, high efficiency, good durability, and easy fabrication. However, the commercial application of DSSCs has been hindered by limited power conversion efficiency. With an aim of significantly enhancing the light-to-electric conversion efficiency, here we pioneer synthesizing polyaniline–single wall nanotube (PANi–SWCNT) complexes using a reflux technique which are employed as counter electrodes (CEs) for DSSCs. Owing to the facile charge transfer between PANi (N atoms) and SWNT (C atoms) by a covalent bond, electrical conduction, electrocatalysis, and therefore conversion efficiency have been markedly elevated in comparison with that of PANi-only CE. The DSSC employing PANi–4‰ SWCNT complex CE gives an impressive power conversion efficiency of 7.81%. The high conversion efficiency, facile charge-transfer in combination with simple preparation, relatively low cost and scalability demonstrates the potential use of PANi–SWCNT complex in robust DSSCs.
1 Introduction
Solar energy accounts for 99% of total earth energy, which is clean, inexhaustible, and with no geographical restrictions. Therefore, solar cells have been at the heart of current low-carbon economy and have led to growing interest in the field of environmental and energy applications because of the depletion and pollution of fossil fuels.1,2 Among diverse solar cells, dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) is a promising candidate owing to its environmental friendliness, low cost, easy fabrication, good durability, and relatively high conversion efficiency.3–8 As one of the most significant components in DSSC, Pt counter electrode (CE) is relatively expensive for future commercial applications. It is a prerequisite to developing facile, cheap as well as efficient CE materials for large-scale DSSC assemblies. Considering that the task of CE is the reduction of redox species used as a mediator in regenerating sensitizer after electron injection in a liquid-state/quasi-solid-state DSSC, or collection of the holes from the hole-conducting material in a solid-state DSSC, conducting polymers are promising candidates to meet all of these requirements because of their merits on reversible redox, facile synthesis, good environmental stability, and low cost.9,10 However, the electrical conduction of conducting polymers is relatively low in comparison with carbon-based and Pt-based materials. Reports on the light-to-electric conversion efficiencies from conducting polymer CEs are generally at a level of ∼7%,11–14 not to mention commercial fabrication. Although an impressive conversion efficiency of 9.2% has been reported from poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) CEs,15 the prospect of conducting polymer CEs is still a dilemma. The combination of the unique properties of CNTs with hole-conducting conjugated polymers makes their combined composite materials interesting for enhancing electrical conduction and therefore the power conversion efficiency of DSSCs.16,17 However, low solubility of pristine CNTs in most organic solvents has been the main barrier for their chemical manipulation, quantitative characterization and potential use.18 To bypass this disadvantage, an efficient key is the functionalization of CNTs with polymers, leading to soluble composite materials.19,20 Although surface modification can improve their solubility to some extent, they suffer from an oxidation process which may destroy the well-defined conjugated alignment and therefore weaken the physical, chemical, and electrochemical properties. Moreover, the use of chemically, physically or electrochemically co-deposited conducting polymer/CNT composites as CEs in DSSCs causes two impediments: (i) the interfacial resistance between conducting polymer and CNT is relatively high because of their unsatisfactory bonding, which gives a low charge-transfer kinetics; (ii) not all intrinsic performances of CNTs can be maintained after tedious chemical derivatization. Therefore, CNTs do not fulfil their excellent function for enhancing the conversion efficiency of DSSCs.
In search of more robust conducting polymer/CNT composite CEs, here we pioneer reporting the employment of polyaniline–single wall CNT (PANi–SWCNT) complexes obtained by a reflux technique as CEs of DSSCs. Results suggest that the PANi–SWCNT complex CEs have a much higher charge-transfer kinetics and promotion effect on the efficiency enhancement of DSSC.
2 Experimental
Reflux synthesis of aniline–SWCNT complexes
The aniline–SWCNT complexes were synthesized by a reflux process. In details, three aniline–SWCNT mixtures with SWCNT dosages of 1, 2, and 4 wt‰ were sealed in a three-neck flask filled with high-purity N2 gas. In the dark, the mixtures were refluxed for 3 h at 184 °C to obtain homogeneous aniline–SWCNT complexes, which were subsequently stored in the dark under cold air.
Fabrication of PANi–SWCNT complex CEs
50 mL of an aqueous solution consisting of HCl (1 M) and (NH4)2S2O8 was dipped into a 50 mL mixture consisting of HCl (1 M) and aniline–SWCNT (0.325 M) at 0 °C within 2 h. Before the polymerization reaction, pre-treated FTO glass substrate was horizontally put in the bottom of a container. After the reaction at 4 °C for 10 h, the FTO glass substrate was successively rinsed with 1 M HCl aqueous solution and deionized water to remove unreacted aniline monomers and oligomers. Finally, the FTO supported PANi–SWCNT complex CEs were desiccated in vacuo at 50 °C for 24 h.
Assembly of DSSCs
A layer of TiO2 nanocrystal anode film with a thickness of 10 μm was prepared by a sol-hydrothermal method. The resultant anodes were further sensitized by immersing into a 0.25 mM ethanol solution of N719 dye ([cis-di(thiocyanato)-N,N′-bis(2,2′-bipyridyl-4-carboxylic acid)-4-tetrabutylammonium carboxylate]). The DSSC was fabricated by sandwiching redox electrolyte between dye-sensitized TiO2 anode and a FTO supported PANi–SWCNT complex CEs. A redox electrolyte consisting of 100 mM tetraethylammonium iodide, 100 mM tetramethylammonium iodide, 100 mM tetrabutylammonium iodide, 100 mM NaI, 100 mM KI, 100 mM LiI, 50 mM I2, and 500 mM 4-tert-butyl-pyridine in 50 mL acetonitrile.
Electrochemical characterizations
The electrochemical performances were recorded on a conventional CHI660E setup comprising an Ag/AgCl reference electrode, a CE of platinum sheet, and a working electrode of FTO glass supported PANi–SWCNT complex. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves were recorded from −0.6 to +1.6 V and back to −0.6 V. Before the measurement, the supporting electrolyte consisting of 50 mM LiI, 10 mM I2, and 500 mM LiClO4 in acetonitrile was degassed using nitrogen for 10 min. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were also carried out on the CHI660E Electrochemical Workstation in a frequency range of 0.01 Hz to 105 kHz and an ac amplitude of 10 mV at room temperature. The resultant impedance spectra were analyzed using the Z-view software. Tafel polarization curves were recorded on the same Workstation by assembling symmetric cell consisting of FTO/PANi–SWCNT complex|redox electrolyte|FTO/PANi–SWCNT complex. The curves were recorded at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1.
Photovoltaic test
The photovoltaic test of the DSSC was carried out by measuring the current–voltage (J–V) characteristic curves using an Electrochemical Workstation (CHI660E, Shanghai Chenhua Device Company, China) under irradiation of a simulated solar light from a 100 W xenon arc lamp (XQ-500 W) in ambient atmosphere. The incident light intensity was controlled at 100 mW cm−2 (AM1.5). Each DSSC was repeated for 5 times and a compromise J–V curve was employed.
Other characterizations
The morphologies of the PANi-only or PANi–SWCNT complex CEs were observed with a scanning electron microscope (SEM, S4800). Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FTIR) spectra were recorded on a PerkinElmer spectrum 1760 FTIR spectrometer. The UV-vis spectra were measured on a UV-3200 spectrophotometer by dissolving the samples in deionized water. The fluorescence emission spectra were recorded at room temperature using a Fluorolog3-P spectrophotometer. The emission spectrum was collected using a conventional setup at excitation wavelengths of 500 nm. Fourier transformed Raman spectroscopic measurements in the ultraviolet light were performed on a Renishaw inVia Reflex Raman Spectrometer. High-resolution gratings were used to give a spectral resolution of 2 cm−1.
3 Results and discussion
Spectra analysis and morphology observation
A prerequisite of fabricating robust PANi–SWCNT complexes with rapid charge-transfer is the successful chemical attachment of aniline onto SWCNT. Fig. 1a gives fluorescence emission spectra of pure aniline and resultant aniline–SWCNT complexes diluted with acetone solution and excited at 500 nm. The maximum emissions in acetone are at around 570 and 615 nm, whereas the pure aniline fluorescence is generally markedly quenched. Pure SWCNT is believed to give an excitation at 565 nm.21 The fluorescence excitation spectra of the aniline–SWCNT complexes are quite different from the absorption spectra of the individual components, indicating the formation of a new light-absorbing species. It is noteworthy to mention that the red shift of maximum emission, as is shown in Fig. 1b–d, is in an order of acetone, toluene and methanol, which is believed as the major contributions of their polarities to π–π stacking resulted from the electrostatic interactions and hydrophobic effects.22

Emission spectra of aniline–SWCNT complexes at SWCNT dosages of (b) 1 wt‰, (c) 2 wt‰ and (d) 4 wt‰ diluted in organic solvents: acetone, toluene, and methanol. The excitation wavelength was 500 nm. 
To reveal the complexing mechanism of aniline molecules onto SWCNTs, UV-vis adsorption spectra of pure aniline, aniline–2 wt‰ SWCNT complex, and aniline–2 wt‰ SWCNT mixture were diluted in acetone, as is shown in Fig. 2. A single band is detected at around 320 nm in the spectrum of aniline, which is originated from the π–π* transition of the benzene rings and the excitation of the quinoid rings.23 In comparison with the UV-vis spectrum of aniline–SWCNT mixture, new absorption bands at 366, 458, 513, and 552 nm are observed, suggesting the successful complexation of aniline and SWCNT for efficient charge-transfer complex.24,25 At an elevated temperature, such as 184 °C, SWCNT and aniline are believed to form a facile charge-transfer complex in its ground state because SWCNT is a good electron acceptor, whereas aniline is a fairly good electron donor, as evidenced by the appearance of the new absorptions. Originating from aniline monomers, they suffer from dimers, trimers, oligomers and conjugated PANi in the presence of APS and protonic acid.26 As shown in Fig. 3a, each imine group (–NH–) has a lone-electron pair which can share with a carbon atom in conjugation structure of SWCNT (–C) to form a covalent bond (Fig. 3b). There is a consensus that the chemical bonding between PANi and SWCNT can significantly accelerate the charge transfer.27–29 Furthermore, researches validate that the resultant PANi chains are intertwisted to form agglomerated nanoparticles in traditional chemical polymerization because of the strong intramolecular and intermolecular hydrogen bonding,30,31 resulting in low electron delocalization, short-range charge transfer and therefore poor electrical and electrochemical performances. The parallel bonding can dramatically enhance the well-aligned arrangement of PANi chains along the outer-surface of SWCNTs, which is expected to give extraordinary synergistic effect in accelerating charge transfer.

Fig. 4a provides the reference FTIR spectrum of bared PANi and PANi–SWCNT complexes. The main absorption bands situated at ca. 795, 1093, 1296, 1480, and 1560 cm−1 are attributed to the following vibration modes: bending of C–H (out-of-plane) on benzene ring (B), bending of C–H (in-plane), mode of Nquinoid ring (Q)N, stretching of Caromatic-N, stretching of N–B–N and stretching of NQN, respectively.32,33 By comparison with bared PANi spectrum, the FTIR spectra of PANi–SWCNT complex give a signal of appearance of the 1034 cm−1 band, especially in high SWCNT dosage. The present of this FTIR band indicates a charge transfer and a selective interaction of the SWCNTs fragments with quinoid rings of PANi backbones.34 A similar interaction between CNTs and PANi quinoid rings has also been detected in PANi/multi-walled CNTs.35 An opposing effect of peak intensity at 1296 cm−1 to SWCNT dosage suggests that the enhanced bonding between N atoms (–NH– in PANi) with C atoms (in SWCNT) restrict the absorption vibration of NQN.

Fig. 4b shows Raman spectra of pure PANi and PANi–SWCNT complexes. All spectra of complexes show typical SWCNT features for the tangential (D band) and radial (G band) breathing modes at 1338 and 1598 cm−1, respectively.36 There is an increase trend in relative intensity of the D band with increase of SWCNT dosage in PANi–SWCNT complexes. The band at 1351 cm−1 in the PANi spectrum provides the information on C–N+˙ vibration of delocalized polaronic structures. The increasing intensity at high SWCNT dosage reveals the enhancement of delocalization degree of C–N+˙ segment,37 which strongly validate the reasonability of proposed complexation mechanism.
The microstructure of the bared PANi coated FTO electrode is observed by SEM, as shown in Fig. 5a, suggesting compact aggregations because of strong intramolecular and intermolecular hydrogen bonding. This closely packed structure provides increased interfacial resistance for charger transfer and penetration resistance for exchange of I−/I3− redox couples, whereas looser and porous structure is captured in PANi–4 wt‰ SWCNT complex CE (Fig. 5b). We can find only fibrous structure in complex of PANi–SWCNT instead of separation of them, suggesting that the PANi molecules are completely bonded onto the surface of SWCNTs by covalent bonds. The morphological results validate the rationality of proposed complexation mechanism in Fig. 3b. The porous structure is expected to enhance the loading and to facilitate the migration of I−/I3− redox couples within CE.

Electrochemical behaviors
To explore the electrocatalytic activity of PANi–SWCNT complex on I−/I3− redox species, we recorded the CV curves of the resultant complex CEs in liquid electrolyte with PANi-only CE as a reference, as is shown in Fig. 6. The peak positions and shapes of the CV curves from PANi–SWCNT complex CEs are very similar to those of Pt and PANi-only CE, revealing that PANi–SWCNT complex CEs have a similar electrocatalytic activity to Pt CE. Considering that the task of CE is to reduce redox species, mediators in regenerating the sensitizer after electron injection in a liquid-state DSSC, the electroreduction reaction of I3− + 2e → 3I− can be employed to elevate the electrocatalytic activity of PANi–SWCNT complex CEs. Notably, the combination of SWCNT with PANi significantly increases the peak current density and decreases the peak-to-peak separation (Epp). The higher peak current densities and lower Epp values in Table 1 suggest an enhanced electroreductive behavior to I−/I3− redox. It is noteworthy to mention that the SWCNT dosage has a promotion effect on enhancing electrocatalytic activity because of the incremental quantity in bonding sites for rapid charge-transfer. Moreover, the ratio of Jox1/|Jred1| is a parameter to elevate the reversibility of the redox reaction toward I−/I3−.38 The obtained value from PANi–4 wt‰ SWCNT complex CE is closer to 1.0, indicating a more reversible redox reaction for I3− ↔ I−. The rapid recovery of iodides to their ground state facilitates the participation in subsequent circles and improves the long-term stability. To elucidate the relationship between increased bonding sites and diffusion of iodide in a complex CE, Randles–Sevcik theory is employed and presented:39Jred = Kn1.5ACDn0.5ν0.5where Jred is the peak current density of Red1 (mA cm−2), K is 2.69 × 105, n is the number of electrons of reduction reaction, A is the electrode area (cm2), C represents the bulk concentration of I3− (mol L−1), Dn is the diffusion coefficient (cm−2 s−1). The diffusivity of PANi-only CE is 4.97 × 10−6 cm−2 s−1 which is comparable to 4.92 × 10−6 cm−2 s−1 of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) and 2.55 × 10−6 cm−2 s−1 of Pt CEs.40 There is an ascending trend in increasing SWCNT dosage and it is 4.20 × 10−5 cm−2 s−1 for PANi–4 wt‰ SWCNT complex CE which is higher than 1.26 × 10−5 cm−2 s−1 for PEDOT/multi-walled CNT CE. Results indicate that the enhanced bonding sites between PANi and SWCNT can accelerate both charge transfer and iodide species within PANi–SWCNT complex CEs.

From the stacking CV curves of PANi–4 wt‰ SWCNT complex CE at different scan rates, one can find an outward extension of all the peaks (Fig. 7a). By plotting peak current density corresponding to I3− ↔ I−versus square root of scan rate, as shown in Fig. 7b, linear relationships are observed. This result indicates the redox reaction is a diffusion-controlled mechanism on PANi and PANi–SWCNT complex CEs.41 This may be the result from transport of iodide species on CE surfaces. With an aim of further elucidating the catalytic activities of PANi–SWCNT complex CEs on the reduction of triiodide, EIS experiments were carried out in a symmetric cells fabricated by two identical CEs.

Nyquist plots in Fig. 8 illustrate impedance characteristics of PANi-only and PANi–SWCNT complex CEs. According to the Randles-type circuit (inset of Fig. 8), the intercept on the real axis represents the series resistance (Rs), a reflection of film resistance. The arc arises from the charge-transfer resistance (Rct) at CE/electrolyte interface, which changes inversely with the electrocatalytic activity of CEs on the reduction of triiodide, whereas W represents the Nernst diffusion impedance corresponding to the diffusion resistance of I−/I3− redox species. CPE is a constant phase element and is frequently used as a substitute for a capacitor in an equivalent circuit to fit the impedance behavior of the electrical double layer. The CPE is defined by two values, CPE-T and CPE-P. CPE-T is a constant phase element with respect to counter electrodes. CPE-P is a constant that ranges from 0 to 1. These electrochemical parameters were obtained by fitting EIS spectra using a Z-view software, as is shown in Table 2, and there is a good agreement between recorded and fitted curves. Both Rs and Rct decrease with increase of SWCNT dosage, indicating an inverse order of electrocatalytic activity. Moreover, the W value, diffusion resistance of I−/I3−, is declining on SWCNT content. The conclusions for the electrocatalytic activity and diffusion derived from EIS and CV data are consistent.

Tafel polarization investigation, which reveals the interfacial charge-transfer properties at the CE/electrolyte interface, was carried out and presented in Fig. 9 recorded on the symmetrical cells. The larger slope for the anodic or cathodic branch indicates a higher exchange current density (J0) on the electrode and better catalytic activity toward triiodide reduction. Apparently, the calculated J0 also follows an order of PANi–4 wt‰ SWCNT > PANi–2 wt‰ SWCNT > PANi–1 wt‰ SWCNT > PANi, which match the order of Rct. In comparison with PANi-only CE, the enhanced J0 from PANi–SWCNT complex ones derives from the porous structure and rapid charge-transfer, as shown in SEM image and proposed mechanism.42 The intersection of the cathodic branch with the Y-axis can be considered as the limiting diffusion current density (Jlim), which determined by the diffusion properties of the redox couple and the CE catalysts. One can see that the Jlim also follows an order of PANi–4 wt‰ SWCNT > PANi–2 wt‰ SWCNT > PANi–1 wt‰ SWCNT > PANi, which match the order of the diffusion coefficient and W.

Photovoltaic performances

Fig. 10 shows the photovoltaic characteristics of DSSCs from pure PANi and PANi–SWCNT complex CEs and the parameters reflecting DSSC properties are summarized in Table 3. The DSSCs employing PANi–SWCNT complex CEs achieve higher Jsc than that fabricated using a bared PANi CE. This might be attributed to the PANi–SWCNT complex CEs having porous structure, which provides larger active surface areas for I3− reduction. The optimal PANi–SWCNT complexes significantly improve the charge-transfer ability within CEs, which is evident in the higher Jsc observed for the DSSCs. There is a significant enhancement in η of resultant DSSC, and the highest η is 7.81% at 4 wt‰ SWCNT in comparison with that of 6.24% from pure PANi CE. After performing a comprehensive analysis of the DSSCs, it can be concluded that the photovoltaic performance is in agreement with the EIS and Tafel polarization results.

4 Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated that fabrication of PANi–SWCNT complex CEs by a reflux technique is an effective strategy for accelerating the charge transfer with the complexes. New light-absorbing species and absorption bands can be detected from the fluorescence excitation and UV-vis absorption spectra of aniline–SWCNT complexes. Covalent bonds between PANi (–NH–) and SWCNT (–C) are expected to significantly accelerate the charge transfer. The DSSC from PANi–4 wt‰ SWCNT complex CE provides an impressive power conversion efficiency of 7.81% in comparison with that of 6.24% from pure PANi CE. The research presented here is far from being optimized but these profound advantages along with low-cost synthesis and scalable materials promise the new PANi–SWCNT complex CEs to be strong candidates in robust DSSCs.
