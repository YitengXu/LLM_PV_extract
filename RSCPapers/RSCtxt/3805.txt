    , Accepted 27th June 2022First published on 28th June 2022AbstractElectrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), as a promising green and sustainable method for hydrogen production, has received widespread attention, and designing efficient and stable electrocatalysts is one of the keys to accelerating the development of the hydrogen economy. Herein, B and Ru co-doped iron hollow spheres (H-B/Ru-FeP) are synthesized by ambient boronation, low-temperature phosphorization and acid leaching processes. The hollow porous structure and doping strategy favor enhancing the electrocatalytic kinetics by exposing numerous active sites, building rich mass transport channels and providing efficient adsorption/desorption of reactant/intermediates. Then, the as-synthesized H-B/Ru-FeP exhibits excellent electrocatalytic performance toward HER with low overpotentials of 29 mV, 86 mV, and 110 mV, to drive the current density of 10 mA cm−2 in acidic, neutral and alkaline electrolytes, respectively. The electrolyzer is assembled with H-B/Ru-FeP as the cathode and NiFe foam as the anode, requiring a low cell voltage of 1.54 V to drive 10 mA cm−2. This work opens a novel approach to exploit hollow structures for energy conversion and storage applications.
1. Introduction
With the intensification of environmental pollution caused by fuel combustion and the increase in global energy consumption, researchers are eager to look for new alternative energy sources.1–4 At present, hydrogen is considered to be the best alternative energy due to zero carbon emission and high energy density.5–7 Among the various available approaches, electrocatalytic water splitting is considered as an efficient and green route for hydrogen generation.8–11 As a half reaction, the catalytic activity of HER affects the energy conversion efficiency of water electrolysis. Until now, Pt-based noble-metal catalysts are still the optimal catalysts for HER, but the high cost and scarcity limit their large-scale applications.12–16 Hence, developing efficient, low-cost and stable electrocatalysts with low-content of Pt or other alternative precious metals are pressing challenges.
More recently, transition metal phosphides (TMPs) are widely investigated for HER due to their excellent stability and catalytic properties, as P atoms can capture electrons from the center of the metal to attract protons.17–19 However, it is still fall behind with noble metals. As reported, doping, including metal and nonmetal, is considered a valid strategy to boost the catalytic performance.20,21 B doping can change the electron density of TMPs through partial charge transfer to improve HER performance.22 Ru doping can significantly improve the hydrogen generation performance of TMPs by altering the electronic structure of the original catalyst and creating a coupling effect.23 For instance, Chen et al. successfully synthesized a Ru-doped bimetallic phosphide with excellent catalytic activity and stability for both HER and OER in alkaline solution by Ru3+ etching and low-temperature phosphorylation in two steps.24 Research shows that Ru accelerates the electron transfer in the catalytic process and provides more active sites for HER. Except for the doping approach, the nanostructure of the exploited nanomaterials also affects the catalytic activity of the electrocatalyst. Hollow nano/microstructure plays a key role in regulating the electrocatalytic performances by modulating electron/mass transport kinetics. Owing to the high specific surface area and delimited local voids, that hollow nanostructure is an attractive morphology to provide abundant active sites and multi-channels during electrocatalytic process.25–28 For example, Guo et al. synthesized hollow MoS2 nano/microspheres through a controlled hollow skeleton structure strategy achieving long-term structural stability and synergistic modulation of active sites for efficient HER performance.29 The hollow internal structure can also effectively relieve the structural strain caused by repeated ion insertion/extraction processes, protect encapsulated active nanoparticles from agglomeration and accommodate the pronounced volume variation during the electrochemical reaction. Various strategies are usually utilized to prepare hollow structures, including soft/hard template methods,30–32 acid etching33–35 and ion exchange methods.36 Relatively, acid etching is a facile and low-cost approach to fabricating hollow structures.37 Ji et al. utilized acid etching to form CoP3 nanowires with high specific surface area and excellent catalytic activity toward HER.38
In this work, B, Ru co-doped hollow structured FeP was synthesized by ambient reduction, low-temperature phosphating and acid etching approach (Fig. 1). The designed H-B/Ru-FeP owns a hollow structure coupled with metal/nonmetal doping which favors enhancing the electrocatalytic performance via tuning the reaction kinetics. The synergy between Ru and B generates fantastic intrinsic catalytic activity, and the nanostructure exposes more catalytic active sites. As a result, the prepared H-B/Ru-FeP displays excellent electrocatalytic performance and stability in a wide pH range. Moreover, H-B/Ru-FeP and NiFe foam are used as cathode and anode, respectively, and a current density of 10 mA cm−2 can be achieved with a relatively low voltage of 1.54 V. Interestingly, the assembled electrolyzer can be powered by sustainable energies.

2. Material and methods
2.1 Synthesis of H-B/Ru-FeP
229.76 mg of FeCl3·6H2O and 3 mL of RuCl3·xH2O (10 mg mL−1) were added to a beaker containing 47 mL of water under stirring. Subsequently, 0.189 g of NaBH4 was poured into the reaction container and continued to stir for 15 minutes. The products were collected by vacuum filtration and dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C for 4 h. The obtained sample was named Ru-Fe-B. 50 mg of Ru-Fe-B and 500 mg NaH2PO2·H2O were annealed in a tube furnace with 2 °C min−1 to 350 °C for 2 h under Ar atmosphere, the resulting sample was named B/Ru-FeP. After that, the synthesized B/Ru-FeP sample was etched in 1 M hydrochloric acid for 12 h and cleaned by ultrasonication for 1 h. The sample was washed several times with water and ethanol, then dried under vacuum, and the final sample was named H-B/Ru-FeP.
As a comparison, B-FeP is synthesized in the same method as B/Ru-FeP without the addition of RuCl3·xH2O.
2.2 Electrochemical measurement
All tests were performed via an electrochemical workstation (CHI 760E) at room temperature with a standard three-electrode system. The carbon rod and reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) are used as counter and reference electrodes, respectively. Then, 20 μL of catalyst ink by ultrasonically dispersing (5 mg catalyst, 0.95 mL isopropanol, and 0.05 mL Nafion solution) was dipped onto the L-shaped glassy carbon electrode (GCE) as the working electrode, the electrode area is 0.196 cm2. The linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves were tested at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1, and all curves were 95% IR corrected. And cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves were acquired in the non-Faraday region at different scan rates (20, 40, 60, 80 and 100 mV s−1).
For RHE, fill the electrode with different electrolytes (1 M KOH, 0.5 M H2SO4 or 1 M PBS) and then perform i–t chronoamperometric measurement at 10 V with different time.
3. Result and discussion
3.1 Materials characterization
The crystal structure of the obtained electrocatalyst was studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Fig. 2a), and the prepared H-B/Ru-FeP is matched well with FeP, without crystalline structure of Ru and boride, demonstrating Ru and B doped successfully. The introduced heteroatom B can change the coordination environment of the sample, thus improving the HER performance.39 The morphology of the prepared electrocatalyst was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As shown in Fig. S1,† the solid nanoparticles of B/Ru-FeP changed into porous structure with abundant pores and interconnected channels after acid etching, which is also confirmed by the TEM images (Fig. 2b, c and S2†). The abundant pores and rich channels provide plentiful active sites and favor the fast release of generated gas bubbles during electrocatalytic process to optimize the catalytic activity. Fig. 2d shows the interplanar spacing is determined to be 0.241 nm, corresponding to the (111) plane of FeP. Moreover, abundant defects can be clearly observed in the prepared H-B/Ru-FeP, which also in favors to promoting the electrocatalytic performance.40–42 The elemental mappings verify Fe, P, Ru and B are distributed homogeneously in the synthesized H-B/Ru-FeP (Fig. 2e–h).

Fig. 3a shows the specific surface area and pore size distribution in H-B/Ru-FeP, the isotherm pattern for the sample is IUPAC type IV,43 nitrogen absorption at relatively low pressure and a significant hysteresis loop at relatively high pressure, which is the characteristic of typical mesoporous materials.44 The porous structure effectively imparted the composite with large specific surface area (65.15 m2 g−1).45 Most pore sizes are in the range of 30–55 nm.46 The elemental composition and valence state of H-B/Ru-FeP were investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), where the XPS survey spectrum of the sample revealed the presence of Ru, Fe, P, B, and O in H-B/Ru-FeP (Fig. 3b). The presence of oxygen may be due to the inevitable oxidation of the sample in the air. The XPS spectra of Fe 2p3/2 can be fitted to three peaks located at 706.7 eV, 709.9 eV and 715 eV (Fig. 3c), corresponding to Fe species of FeP, Fe–O and a shake-up satellite peak, respectively.47,48 The peaks at 719.6 eV, 724 eV and 730 eV are attributed to Fe 2p1/2.48,49 In the high-resolution XPS spectrum of P 2p (Fig. 3d), the peak at 132.5 eV correspond to P–O, where the peaks located at 128.6 eV and 129.7 eV were attributed to M–P.50 The signal peaks at about 483.3 eV and 460.9 eV have been assigned to Ru 3p1/2 and 3p3/2 of Ru0. The following peaks (487.5 eV and 464.9 eV) are ascribed to Ru(IV)51 (Fig. 3e). Fig. 3f shows a typical XPS spectrum for B 1s, which can be contribute to B0 (186.6 eV) and B–O (189.8 eV).52

3.2 Hydrogen evolution reaction measurement
We investigated the HER performances of the prepared H-B/Ru-FeP in acidic, alkaline, and neutral electrolytes with a typical three-electrode system. Firstly, we evaluated the catalytic activity of the catalyst in 0.5 M H2SO4, as shown in Fig. 4a, the overpotential of H-B/Ru-FeP at 10 mA cm−2 current density is only 29 mV, outperformed Pt/C (31 mV), B-FeP (109 mV), Ru-Fe-B (98 mV) and B/Ru-FeP (40 mV). Tafel slope can reflect the reaction path and rate-determining step of HER. Obviously, the Tafel slope of H-B/Ru-FeP is 35.2 mV dec−1 (Fig. 4b), significantly lower than B-FeP (53.7 mV dec−1), Ru-Fe-B (58.2 mV dec−1), and B/Ru-FeP (38.0 mV dec−1), indicating the fastest reaction kinetics. Moreover, H-B/Ru-FeP conforms to the Volmer–Heyrovsky mechanism. The comparison between B/Ru-FeP and H-B/Ru-FeP demonstrates that the hollow porous structure further improved HER performance by increasing the contact area between catalyst and electrolyte. The electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) can reflect the actual exposed area of the catalyst, and then reflect the internal catalytic activity of the catalyst. Electrochemical double-layer capacitance (Cdl) is directly proportional to the ECSA,53 which is the linear relationship between charge point current and scan rate. CV curves were obtained by selecting a 100 mV symmetric interval in the non-Faraday region (Fig. S3†). The Cdl of H-B/Ru-FeP is significantly higher than that of other catalysts (Fig. 4c), which verifies that Ru, B co-doped hollow nanostructure brings more electrocatalytic active sites and leads to the improvement of HER performance.17 At the same overpotential, the current density of H-B/Ru-FeP is the largest (Fig. 4d). Fig. 4e and Table S1† show that the as-prepared electrocatalyst has superior performance. Evidently, H-B/Ru-FeP possesses extraordinary stability which can maintain for more than 10 h with no attenuation (Fig. 4f). Ru, B Co-doped hollow structured FeP catalyst is a promising candidate for hydrogen production in electrolysis systems due to its high catalytic performance and fantastic durability.

(f) Stability measurement of the H-B/Ru-FeP for 10 h. 
In 1 M PBS solution, H-B/Ru-FeP only needs 86 mV to reach 10 mA cm−2 (Fig. 5a), lower than B/Ru-FeP (97 mV), Ru-Fe-B (109 mV), B-FeP (144 mV), except for Pt/C (27 mV). The reaction kinetics of the prepared electrocatalysts were evaluated by the Tafel slope. As shown in Fig. 5b, the corresponding Tafel slope of H-B/Ru-FeP is 72.5 mV dec−1, lower than those of B-FeP (101.1 mV dec−1), Ru-Fe-B (100.4 mV dec−1), and B/Ru-FeP (74.4 mV dec−1), revealing a more valid kinetic process The reaction of H-B/Ru-FeP also conforms to the Volmer–Heyrovsky mechanism. Fig. S4† shows the CV curves of H-B/Ru-FeP at different scan rates (20, 40, 60, 80 and 100 mV s−1), the Cdl of H-B/Ru-FeP can be determined from the CV, which is expected to be linearly proportional to the ECSA. The Cdl value of H-B/Ru-FeP is significantly higher than other electrocatalysts (Fig. 5c). H-B/Ru-FeP achieves the highest current density with the same applied overpotential (Fig. 5d). Compared with other electrocatalysts (Fig. 5e and Table S2†), the performance of this work is more excellent than other catalysts. Stability is also an important criterion to evaluate the performance of the catalysts, because stability is especially necessary for practical application. The catalyst has outstanding stability, and the current density slightly decays in a neutral solution within 10 h (Fig. 5f).

(f) Stability measurement of the H-B/Ru-FeP for 10 h. 
In 1 M KOH solution, compared with other samples, drive 10 mA cm−2, 110 mV, 168 mV, 280 mV, 160 mV, and 48 mV are required for H-B/Ru-FeP, B-FeP, Ru-Fe-B, B/Ru-FeP, and Pt/C. The Tafel slope of H-B/Ru-FeP is 76.1 mV dec−1 (Fig. 6b), indicating that they have good electrochemical performance. The comparison between Ru-Fe-B and B/Ru-FeP shows that the phosphating process has a significant promotion effect on the catalytic performance, because non-metallic elements with strong electronegativity can be used to change the electronic structure of Ru atoms, to enhance adsorption/desorption performance of reaction intermediates, and P atoms can capture electrons from the center of the metal to attract protons.17 In a specific range, the Cdl value is obtained by CVs at different scan rates (Fig. S5†). The Cdl of H-B/Ru-FeP is significantly higher than other catalysts (Fig. 6c). In 1 M KOH, when the current density of H-B/Ru-FeP reaches 10 mA cm−2, the overpotential is the lowest (Fig. 6d), and the current density is the highest at the same overpotential. Compared with other works (Fig. 6e and Table S3†), this work has comparable catalytic performance with other catalysts, and it also has good stability. The stability in alkaline solution shows almost no attenuation within 10 h (Fig. 6f).

3.3 Overall water splitting measurement
Due to the excellent HER activity of the catalysts, a two-electrode system was used to conduct the overall water splitting test in 1 M KOH with nickel iron foam (1 cm2) and the prepared electrocatalyst as the anode and cathode. Fig. 7a is a simulated diagram of overall water splitting solution. The two-electrode system consisting of H-B/Ru-FeP ‖ NiFe foam is carried out. Fig. 7b shows that NiFe foam ‖ NiFe foam system requires a voltage of 1.75 V to reach 10 mA cm−2, H-B/Ru-FeP ‖ NiFe foam system only needs 1.54 V, which also has remarkable stability during the overall water splitting process (Fig. 7c). A Stirling generator is a kind of external combustion engine.54 The common heat sources include solar energy and nuclear reactor heat, which can be used to electrolyze water to produce hydrogen (Fig. 7d). Fig. 7e is a partial enlarged view, it can be clearly seen that bubbles are emerging from the cathode. H-B/Ru-FeP is superior to most of the state-of-art overall water splitting electrocatalysts previously reported (Fig. 7f and Table S4†), which demonstrates the outstanding potential of the as-prepared electrode.

4. Conclusion
In short, Ru, B co-doped iron phosphide catalyst showed outstanding catalytic performance for HER in the wide pH range. The Ru and B doping act as a significant role in promoting the electrocatalytic performance by regulating the electronic density and then accelerating the reaction kinetics. The coupling effects of Ru and B co-doping could improve the catalytic performance efficiently relative to the mono-element doping. In addition, the two-electrode system consisting of H-B/Ru-FeP and nickel iron foam was tested for overall water splitting. The voltage of the H-B/Ru-FeP ‖ NiFe foam system only needed 1.54 V to reach 10 mA cm−2. The catalyst has great application potential in high-efficiency hydrogen evolution and overall water splitting, which opens up a new direction for the scalable synthesis of high-efficiency electrocatalysts.
