The different chemical reactivity of Npy-substituted derivatives in polar protic solvents, in the presence of the AgI-salts, with the dinuclear silver(I/II) organometallic precursors exhibiting C–AgI/II–Cl covalently bonded species, is described. The latter are elucidated fully by the theoretical quantum chemical method and experimentally evidenced by mass spectrometry in the gas phase (GP), involving a variety of ionization techniques. To our knowledge, we first report a comprehensive study of the nature of the organometallic precursors, which represents an important step of the catalyzed C–C and C–N coupling processes. Thus impacting all fields the enormous synthetic research efforts are focused on PZs, which through the diversity of the molecular architectures are main components observed in naturally occurring products (NPs), dyes, pesticides, antibiotics, etc. The emphasis of the paper is on the mass spectrometry (MS), employing its high-resolution power and accuracy of the analytical qualitative, quantitative and structural information as well as the physico-chemical thermodynamic one, at the analyte concentrations in the range of fg g−1. The latter, which are beyond the capability of other instrumental methods for structural analysis, make the MS an irreplaceable method in the advanced catalytical research. Its combined application with the method of the quantum chemistry provides reliable thermodynamic information in the condensed phase and in the GP, which helps understand comprehensively the mechanisms of the organometallic catalyzing processes, particularly the unique coupling reactions, thus improving significantly their effectiveness.1. IntroductionThe phenazines (PZs) are important molecular components that can be found in a diverse number of NPs, dyes, pesticides, antibiotics and others.1 Great interest in the functionalized PZs is due to their excellent photo-physical and photochemical properties with wide application in solar cell energy conversion systems as well as their remarkable ability to coordinate transition metal complexes with anticancer drugs due to their strong stereo and sequence-specific interactions with the DNA double helix. The light-switching effect and cytotoxic properties of metal complexes of PZs from particularly ruthenium and rhenium ones are determined.2 In this respect, the research interest in the development of synthetic approaches for obtaining the substituted PZs consisted mainly in the CuII/I and PtII/IV catalyzed C–N coupling reactions.3 Recently very efficient synthetic strategies have been developed; however, they use hindered substrates, will occasionally be conducted at room temperature, longer reaction times and relatively high loadings, low tolerance for functional groups, low solubility in water, etc. Thus, the elaboration of new approaches, involving catalysts, effective towards a large number of functional groups and complexes of the highly functionalized starting reagents, would be of great interest and importance to push back the frontier of the advanced organic synthesis. Our interest in PZs and oxazines, as main structural motifs in naturally occurring humic substances,4 is based on systematic efforts for elaboration of effective analytical methods for environmental control of plant protecting agents against susceptible bacterial and fungal pathogens.5 The PZs-producing strains reside on roots, which can protect cultivated plants; therefore, the search for novel synthetic approaches of a large scale of substituted PZs is of emergency. Here, we report an effectively synthetic organosilver approach for functionalization of the PZs from substituted anilines and pyridyl-carbaldehydes in polar protic solvents such as methanol or water. Its advantages consist in wide functionalization tolerance, C–N cross-coupling reaction effectiveness under mild experimental conditions, easily accessible catalyst and high catalytic activity. The comprehensive studies on organometallics catalyzing cross-coupling C–C for obtaining of the symmetrical and unsymmetrical biaryls, involved C–Mn+–Cl covalent organometallic precursors (Mn+ = PtII/IV, PdII/III/IV, CuII/I, Hg0/I, AgI/III, AuI/III and more which are important intermediates for the formation of the substituted phenyls and/or benzo[n]chromenes (n = 4 or 6).6 The useful information regarding the catalytic activity of the organosilver(I/II) precursors consists in the fact that the effort to isolate oxazines from the starting substituted anilines and benzaldehydes resulted in selective formation of only the reported PZs in yields 56–78% and N-substituted 3,6,12,15-tetrahydro-9,18-dioxa-3,6,12,15-tetraaza-phenanthro[9,10-b]triphenylenes. Since most of the reported 2-pyridyl derivatives are prepared through coupling reactions such as Suzuki, Still, Grignard and Negishi, in the presence of the above-mentioned transition metal catalyst, we focused our attention on the corresponding 3- and 4-pyridyl derivatives. Being heterocyclics, pyridyl-functional groups often found in NPs possessed prominent broad spectrum of biological activities, and are applied in pharmaceutical, agrochemical and medicinal chemistry research.6,7 Despite the large number of catalytic studies involving the silver-containing organometallics in homogeneous catalysis, the structure and chemical mechanistic states of the silver ions, electronic structures of the intermediates and their physical properties remain elusive.3,7 To our knowledge, this study for the first time in the literature, focused the attention on the mechanistic aspects of the catalytic reactions, employing the MS and the method of quantum chemistry, evidencing the formation of dinuclear covalently bonded intermediates, in which the metal centers formed C–AgI/II–Cl chromophores. In this respect, mass spectrometry, with its capability to utilize different ionization techniques, flexible sample preparation ones, and providing highly precise analytical qualitative, quantitative and structural information, even in the concentration range of fg (mL)−1, is a unique irreplaceable method for physically elucidating the organometallic precursors and catalysing processes.4,8 Furthermore, its combined application with the method of the quantum chemistry helps study the kinetics and the thermodynamics both theoretically and experimentally and provides a unique opportunity to understand comprehensively the organometallic catalysing processes, and thus to improve their effectiveness. In this context it is important to note that the proposed involvement of the silver ions in the various states in the oxidative homogeneous catalysis reported herein is based on numerous heterogeneous catalysed coupling processes where the silver is found in other forms of the oxidized states, including initially the metallic silver and its oxide Ag2O.2. ExperimentalSynthesisThe synthesis is performed by the following method, involving polar protic solvents such as water, methanol, and solvent mixtures (CH3OH:H2O = 1:1 or H2O:CH3CN = 1:1) of amounts of 50 mL and 5–15 mL ammonium hydroxide solution (NH4OH, ACS reagent, 28–30% NH3 base, Sigma Aldrich). To thus-prepared solutions, 25 mL of each of the reagents (or their mixtures, Scheme 1; S1, ESI†) are added, i.e. N,N-diethyl-p-phenylenediamine (purity 97%), N,N-dimethyl-p-ethylenediamine (97%), 2-pyridinecarboxaldehyde (99%), 3-pyridinecarboxaldehyde (98%), 4-pyridinecarboxaldehyde (99%) or 2-quinolinecarboxaldehyde (97%) (Sigma-Aldrich products as well) at concentrations of 1 × 10−2 mol L−1, and recalculated to the corresponding solvents or mixtures under stirring. Silver nitrate (AgNO3, ACS reagents, AgI-salts, Sigma-Aldrich) in the amount ranging from 5.6–114 ng L−1 is added drop-wise to the reaction mixtures. 1-Cyclohexyl-pyridine-4-carbaldehyde iodide, 1-cyclohexyl-3-formyl-pyridinium iodide, 1-cyclohexyl-2-formyl-pyridinium iodide or 1-cyclohexyl-2-formyl-quinolinium iodide (R1 = C6H12, Scheme 1) used as reagents for the synthesis of 1–9 are obtained by mixing equimolar amounts of iodocyclohexane (98%, copper as stabilizer) and above-mentioned aldehydes at r.t. under continuous stirring (yields 97–99%). The Npy-carbaldehydes, substituted by phenylamine, N,N-diethyl- or N,N-dimethyl aniline residues (R1 = –C6H4–NH2, –C6H4–N(CH3)2 or –C6H4–N(CH2CH3)2, 15–22) are obtained according to the proposed mechanisms. Determination of isolated substances is confirmed as well by 1H- and 13C-NMR methods and microanalysis. Scheme 1  Chemical diagram of the phenazines and the organometallic precursors. The PZs 3,6,12,15-tetracyclohexyl-3,6,12,15-tetrahydro-9,18-dioxa-3,6,12,15-tetraaza-phenanthro[9,10-b]triphenylene (4) and (5) (retention time, RT = 9.21 and 9.24 min) revealed MS peaks of K+-adducts of [M − H + K+]+ ions at 762 (Fig. S1, ESI†). 3,6,11-Tricyclohexyl-9-(1-cyclohexyl-1H-pyridin-4-ylidene)-6,9-dihydro-3H-3,6,11-triaza-benzo[b]triphenylen-14-one (2): found, C, 81.6; H, 8.0; calcd [C48H56N4O2], C, 81.7; H, 8.1%; 1H-NMR (400 MHz, CD3CN), δ [ppm]: 3.21–3.56 (11H, m); 9.63 (2H, dd), 9.29 (3H, dt), 8.44, 8.31 (4H, dd), 7.91 (2H, dd) and 7.80 (2H, dd); 13C-NMR: 92.1, 96.8, 102.3, 106.8, 110.4, 111.4, 112.4, 115.6, 121.4, 121.8, 122.5, 123.4, 123.7, 128.5, 129.3, 130.3, 130.4, 130.5, 131.2, 131.4, 131.5, 131.7, 131.9, 168.9, and 55.6–58.9, respectively. PZ (8): found, C, 72.1; H, 3.0; calcd [C24H12N4O2], C, 72.2; H, 3.1%; compound 8 and, similarly, 5, 21, and 22 exhibited in the 1H-NMR spectra 10 proton signals at 5.62–7.32 ppm of the main conjugated [3,8]phenanthrolinium residue. The carbon 13C-NMR signals are observed at 91.0–132.6 ppm, respectively. The R1 = –C6H11 substituents exhibited the series of multiplets proton signals in the range of 2.22–3.21 ppm, while at R1 = –C6H4–N(CH3)2 or –C6H4–N(CH2CH3)2 the aromatic dd is observed in the range of 6.18–7.12 ppm. The proton signals of C6H4–N(CH3)2 are observed as singlet peaks at 3.45 ppm (s, 6H), while the –C6H4–N(CH2CH3)2 functional group showed peaks at 3.21 (4H, t) and 1.75 ppm (6H, t), respectively. 9,18-Dioxa-4,5,13,14-tetraaza-phenanthro[9,10-b]triphenylene (9): found, C, 72.2; H, 3.2; calcd [C24H12N4O2], C, 72.2; H, 3.1%; compound 9 and, in analogy, 4, 19, 20, 21 and 22 exhibited weakly perturbed proton chemical shift signals, within the typical regions for those of the phenanthroline ones. The 13C-NMR spectra revealed carbon signals of 9,18-dioxa-3,6,12,15-tetraaza-phenanthro[9,10-b]triphenylene δ ∈ 90.0–128.6 ppm, in addition to the peaks at 157.8, 160.3, 161.3, and 161.7 ppm of the [1,4]dioxin residues. The 1H-NMR data of R1-substituents showed Δδ ∈ 0.4–2.3 ppm to the above-stated values. The tautomeric equilibrium i/ia (i = 3–5) is difficult to be assigned by 1H- and 13C-NMR spectroscopy. The 2D analysis led us to believe that the compounds existed exclusively in ia form, and the up-field shifting of the aromatic proton and carbon signals of Δδ ∈ 0.5–0.7 and 0.3–1.4 ppm may be attributed to cumulative effects of adjacent substituents at R1-positions, increasing the electron density at the pyridinium fragments by steric interactions. Dibenzo[b,j][4,7]phenanthroline-6,7-dione (10): found, C, 77.3; H, 3.2; calcd [C20H10N2O2], C, 77.4; H, 3.3%; 1H-NMR: δ, ppm 9.13 (s, 2H), 9.44 (s, 8H); N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl-5,10-dihydro-phenazine-2,8-diamine (11): found, C, 71.0; H, 7.5; calcd [C16H20N4], C, 71.6; H, 7.5%; N,N,N′,N′-tetraethyl-5,10-dihydro-phenazine-2,8-diamine (12): found, C, 73.7; H, 8.6; calcd [C20H28N4], C, 74.0; H, 8.7%; 2,8-bis-dimethylamino-10H-phenazin-5-ol (13): found, C, 67.5; H, 7.0; calcd [C16H20N4O], C, 67.6; H, 7.1%; 2,8-bis-diethylamino-10H-phenazin-5-ol (14): found, C, 70.6; H, 8.2; calcd [C20H28N4O], C, 70.6; H, 8.3%; PZ (17): found, C, 76.1; H, 4.8; calcd [C48H36N8O2], C, 76.2; H, 4.8%; PZ (18): found, C, 78.2; H, 6.9; calcd [C64H68N8O2], C, 78.3; H, 6.9%; PZ (19): found, C, 76.2; H, 4.7; calcd [C48H36N8O2], C, 76.2; H, 4.8%; PZ (20): found, C, 78.3; H, 6.8; calcd [C64H68N8O2], C, 78.3; H, 6.9%; the 1H-NMR spectra of 11–14 showed –N(CH3)2 or –N(CH2CH3)2 proton signals δ ∈ 3.11–3.44 ppm as a six-proton sharp singlet or quartet and triplet (2H and 3H). All aromatic protons appeared in separate regions. The two aromatic protons appeared as singlets at 7.60 and 6.88 ppm. The protons appearing in the most down-field region at δ 7.80 (1H, d, J = 7.6 Hz) are due to the proton m- to the –N(CH3)2 (resp. –N(CH2CH3)2) group. The other two protons in the same ring appeared at 7.41 (1H, dd, J = 2.4 Hz) and 6.73 (1H, d, J = 2.5 Hz), respectively.Physical methodsHPLC–ESI–MS/MS measurements are performed on a TSQ 7000 instrument (Thermo Fisher Inc., Rockville, MD, USA), using the mobile phases 0.1% v/v aqueous HCOOH, 0.1% v/v HCOOH in CH3CN or in CH3CN:CH3OH = 1:1. For the electrospray ionization mass spectrometric measurements is used a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (TSQ 7000 Thermo Electron, Dreieich, Germany) equipped with an ESI 2 source at the following conditions: capillary temperature 180 °C; sheath gas 60 psi, corona 4.5 μA and spray voltage 4.5 kV. Samples are dissolved in CH3CN (1 mg mL−1) and are injected into the ion source by an auto-sampler (Surveyor) with a flow of pure CH3CN (0.2 μL min−1). Data processing is performed by Excalibur 1.4 software. A standard LTQ Orbitrap XL (Thermo Fisher Inc.) instrument is used for UV–MALDI–Orbitrap–MS measurements, using the UV laser source at 337 nm. An overall mass range of m/z 100–1000 is scanned simultaneously in the Orbitrap analyzer. The ImageQuest 1.0.1 program package is used. The laser energy values are within 12.0–21.0 μJ. The number of averaged laser shots lies within 8–109, the MALDI flow rate values are within 21.2–23.4; the acquisition time is within 22.7–133.2 min, the corresponding elapsed scan time range lies within 18.5–2.13 s, respectively. Chromatographic purification is performed on a Gynkotek (Germering, Germany) HPLC instrument, equipped with a preparative Kromasil 100 C18 column (250 × 20 mm, 7 μm; Eka Chemicals, Bohus, Sweden) and a UV detector set at 250 nm. The mobile phase is CH3CN:H2O (90:10, v/v) at a flow rate of 4 mL min−1. The analytical HPLC is performed on a Phenomenex (Torrance, CA, USA) RP-18 column (Jupiter 300, 150 × 2 mm, 3 μm) under the same chromatographic conditions. The analysis is performed on a Shimadzu UFLC XR (Kyoto, Japan) instrument, equipped with an auto-sampler, PDA, an on-line degasser and column thermostat. As stationary phase, a Phenomenex Luna Phenyl–Hexyl column (150 × 3 mm i.d., 3 μm particle size) is used. The mobile phase consisted of 0.02% (v/v) TFA in water (solvent A) and acetonitrilemethanol 75:25 (v/v; solvent B). Separation is achieved by a gradient analysis starting with 55A–45B, increasing the amount of solvent B in 30 min to 75% and 30.1 min to 100% B, stop time 40 min. For equilibration a post time of 15 min is applied. Other parameters: flow rate 0.30 mL min−1, injection volume 5 μL, detection wavelength 280 nm; column temperature T = 308 K. The UV–VIS and fluorescence spectra between 200 and 800 nm, using solvents (Uvasol, Merck product) at a concentration of 2.5 × 10−5 M, are recorded on a Tecan Safire Absorbance/Fluorescence XFluor 4 V 4.40 spectrophotometer. The 1H- and 13C- NMR measurements are performed at 298 K with a Bruker 400 DRX spectrometer using 5 mm tubes and solvents D2O, CD3OD and CD3CN, mixtures D2O:CD3OD = 1:1, D2O:CD3CN = 1:1, respectively. The chemical shift reference is sodium 3-(trimethylsilyl)tetradeuteriopropionate. The EP data are obtained in the X-band on a Bruker ER 420 spectrometer. The calorimetric (DSC) ones are performed on DSC-2C Perkin Elmer equipment in argon. IR-spectra are recorded between 4000 and 400 cm−1 on a Thermo Nicolet 6700 FTIR-spectrometer at 150 scans and resolution ±1 cm−1.Computational methodsChemometrics. The experimental and theoretical spectroscopic patterns are processed by R4Cal OpenOffice STATISTICs for Windows 79 program package. Baseline corrections and curve-fitting procedures are applied. The chemometrics involved the statistical significance of each regression coefficient, checked by the t-test. The model fit is determined by the F-test.9Quantum chemical calculations. Quantum chemical calculations were performed with Gaussian 09, Dalton 2011 and LSDALTON, program packages.10 The geometries of the studied organic species were optimized using second-order Moller–Plesset perturbation theory (MP2) and density functional theory (DFT). The DFT method employed involved B3LYP, CAM–B3LYP, and M06–2X functionals for organic compounds. The organometallics ones were studied using the B3PW91 and M06–2X functionals. Molecular geometries were fully optimized by the force gradient method using Berny's algorithm. For every structure the stationary points found on the molecule potential energy hypersurfaces were characterized using standard analytical harmonic vibrational analysis. The absence of the imaginary frequencies, as well as of negative eigenvalues of the second-derivative matrix, confirmed that the stationary points correspond to minima of the potential energy hypersurfaces. The calculation of vibrational frequencies and infrared intensities was checked to establish which kind of calculations performed agree best with the experimental data. The electronic spectra in gas phase and solution were obtained by time-dependent density functional (TD-DFT) method. The basis sets 6-311+G(2d,p), aug-cc-pVDZ and aug-cc-pVTZ were used for organic molecules, while the SDD one was used for the corresponding organometallics. To describe the species in aqueous solution we use both an explicit super-molecule or micro-hydration approach, in which several water molecules are coordinated to the solute at the optimized geometry of the super-molecule, and a polarizable continuum approach (PCM). The micro-hydration approach involved several water molecules coordinated to the solute at the optimized geometry of the super molecule. The protonation ability of the studied model systems was elucidated by the natural bond orbital (NBO) charges and analysis.103. Results and discussionThe mechanistic aspect of the formation of PZs 1, 1a, 2, and 15–18 (Scheme 1; S1, ESI†) is already comprehensively discussed in metal-catalysing C–C coupling reactions, proposing a mononuclear organometallics intermediating species.6,7,11 Furthermore, our MS data of Ib, showing the peaks at m/z 334/336 of [C12H18NOCl107Ag]+/[C12H18NOCl109Ag]+ ions, supported this assumption. The Ib revealed a high thermodynamic stability (ΔG = −397.17 kcal mol−1) which we explain, however, with the charge localization on an AgII ion, obtained by a AgI → AgII redox-process, thus, revealing an electron configuration of d9.76 of the metal centre. In this respect the synthesis of PZs of dppz-type6,7,12 by C–N coupling reactions is as expected. Nonetheless, we replace the usually involved Pd0/II catalysts with salts of AgI ions. The reaction scheme for obtaining dppz involved the intermediate 7 from 6. In our reaction protocol the yields of these derivatives are 47–52%. The novelty, however, consisted in isolation of the products 12, 12a and 14 of about 38–44%, which are explained with the formation of the organometallics intermediates of type II. The latter allowed us to obtain PZs 3–14, respectively. The experimental MS data revealed peaks at m/z 478/480/482, whose elemental composition [C12H17Cl2NO107Ag]+/[C12H17Cl2NO109Ag]+ and isotopic shape assumed the formation of organometallic compound covalently bonded to C–AgI/II–Cl metal chromophores. The calculated thermodynamic parameters and NBO data of IIa and IIb species (Table 1) showed that ΔGIIa > ΔGIIb (ΔΔG = |62.78| kcal mol−1). Both metal ions revealed electronic configurations of 4d4.88 and 4d4.87. Comparison with the thermodynamics of Ib, however, showed that ETIIb < ETIb (ΔET = |607.33| kcal mol−1) while ΔGIIb > ΔGIb (ΔΔG = |293.36| kcal mol−1), respectively. Therefore the obtained difference of the thermodynamic stability of mono- and binuclear organometallics is explained in electrostatic terms, since ΔETE = |287.01| kcal mol−1. The tabulated data exhibited a significant contribution of ESP, since ESPIb ≪ ESPIIb, thus illustrating the impact of the solute–solvent interactions, or in MS terms, the solute–continuum interactions determined the stability of the organometallics in the “GP”, respectively. Although, the obtained high thermodynamic stability of Ib may correlate to the higher yields of 2, in contrast to the corresponding products of type 4 and 5 (yields 1–7%), respectively. The mechanism of producing 11–14 involved the C–N formation with the participation of NH4OH, which has been already discussed in ref. 13. It is important to note that the polar protic solvents, the catalytic amounts of AgI-metal ions and basic (NH4OH) media are important factors to obtain the above-mentioned products of interactions through the organometallic intermediates of type IIb, because only in the non-polar solvents the interaction, including those of the reported anilines and pyridine carbaldehydes resulted in the formation of organic dyes through the classical Schiff's synthetic routes.14 The electronic transitions of 12 and 14 (Fig. 1–3) in acetonitrile:methanol solvent mixtures are correlated to corresponding theoretical values obtained at the M06–2X level of theory. A difference of Δλmax of about 1.4 nm is obtained.

The heteronuclear Diels–Alder reaction caused the formation of dimeric products 12a–14a (Fig. 3). The results are in agreement with the obtained theoretical qX(NBO) values (X = N and O) exhibiting qN5/12(NBO) = −0.410 and −0. 464, while qC4/6/11/13(NBO) are 0.111–0.147, respectively. Furthermore the mechanistic aspects of such reactions are already reported in a series of papers dedicated to the synthesis and characterization of novel OLEDs based on the dppz-dyes.6,7 The reaction scheme for formation of 15–22 involved the N–pyridinium substituents (Scheme S1, ESI†) of phenylamine, N,N-diethyl- or N,N-dimethyl aniline residues (R1 = –C6H5, –C6H4–N(CH3)2 or –C6H4–N(CH2CH3)2), and making efforts to achieve the corresponding oxazines involved the formation of the organometallic precursors of type III (Scheme S2 and Fig. S1, ESI†). The qC1(NBO) and qC4(NBO) values of 0.112, 0.123 and 0.127 make favourable the formation of Ci–AgII–Cl covalently bonded species (i = 1 or 4) in the polar protic solvents in the presence of AgI-ions, since, however, we observed the MS peaks at m/z 234/236, 262/264 and 290/292 of the [C6H7107AgClN]+/[C6H7109AgClN]+, [C8H11107AgClN]+/[C8H11109AgClN]+ and [C10H15107AgClN]+/[C10H15109AgClN]+ organometallics (Fig. 4). Fig. 4  ESI–MS spectrum of organometallic of type III. Their further interactions with the Npy-benzaldehydes yielded the dyes 15–22. In this context, the GP observation of III, in the positive MS operation mode assumed a AgI → AgII redox-process.15 Nonetheless favourable for the inorganic compounds of silver(I) is the AgI → AgIII process in alkaline media, the stabilization of AgII-state is explained only by the formation of C–Ag–Cl covalently bonded species. Furthermore, the comparison of theoretical thermodynamic and NBO data (Table 1) showed that the AgI-organometallics are characterized by higher ΔG values (IIIa, IIIc, IIIe), in contrast to the AgII-precursors (IIIb, IIId, IIIf). These results assumed that the localization of the charge on the metal ion led to an increase in the stability of the species due to the electrostatic contributions, while its localization on the N+(R3)2 moiety led to lower free energies (ΔΔG ∈ |2.11|–|27.03| kcal mol−1). Interestingly, the absolute charge values on metal centres in IIIa–f affected insignificantly the NECs. The metal-to-ligand charge transfer effect is a dominating one, thus causing electronic configuration of the metal ion of 3d4.71–4.73.16 Only in IIIc and IIIe, similar to Ib, the AgI-ion exhibited the 3d9.80 electronic shell configuration, showing the significantly lower ET, including the non-electrostatic terms and higher ΔG values. Since both complexes exhibited C–AgI–Cl linear chromophore, we assign the obtained differences ΔET = |165.28| a.u. and ΔΔG = |34.01| kcal mol−1 to the aliphatic R3-chain effect. Similar to PZs of type 4 and 5 the lower thermodynamic stability of organometallics of type III may explain the yields of 15–22, RT ∈ 8–9 min (Fig. 1).4. ConclusionsIn summary, we have developed a new homogeneous organosilver(I/II) catalyzed system, using the C–N-coupling reactions. The phenazines having substantially different basic molecular skeletal and bulk N-pyridyl substituents are isolated. The molecular structures of organometallic precursors in the various mechanisms involved to catalyze processes are discussed, supported by the experimental mass spectrometric data. The latter are compared with the theoretical quantum chemical ones, thereby, to correlate the electronic structures and physical properties of the organometallic compounds to their thermodynamic stability, and fragmentation patterns observed in the gas phase as well as the catalyzing reactions selectivity. The excellent selectivity to the reported binuclear organometallic compounds of silver ions reveals a C–AgII/I–Cl covalently bonded species to which the AgI → AgII redox-process involved is attributed. The organometallic compounds revealed a significant thermodynamic stability ΔG = −397.12 kcal mol−1. Our results could provide a new strategy to increase the efficiency of organosilver catalyzed coupling processes, improving the C–N and C–C bond formation reactions.AcknowledgementsThe authors thank the Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD), and the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG); the central instrumental laboratories at the Dortmund University (Germany) and the analytical and computational laboratory clusters at the Institute of Environmental Research (INFU) at the same university.Notes and references
