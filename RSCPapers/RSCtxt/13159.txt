, Accepted 30th June 2023First published on 3rd July 2023AbstractOrganic–inorganic hybrid halide perovskites have recently attracted enormous interest as photovoltaic materials because of their superior solar cell performance and straightforward fabrication. Unfortunately, the poor stability and the Pb-related toxicity still hinder their commercialization. Quaternary thioiodides, owing to their ns2 lone pair cations and stronger metal–chalcogen bonds, possess suitable bandgaps, high permittivity, and good stability. Herein, we proposed a series of quaternary thioiodide materials, M22+M3+S2I3 (M2+ = Ca, Sr, Ba, Zn, Cd, Cu, Ti, and Sn; M3+ = Bi, Sb, and In), to solve these problems. Based on first-principles calculations, we confirm four potentially superior photovoltaic materials with suitable solar cell band gaps, high permittivity, low effective masses, and low exciton binding energies. In addition, the calculations predict that these materials possess superior optical absorption properties. Especially, the theoretical spectroscopic limited maximal efficiency of Sn2InS2I3 is over 33%. This study establishes the possibility of the use of lead-free quaternary thioiodides in photovoltaic materials.
Introduction
Hybrid lead-halide perovskites have sparked widespread interest in photovoltaic application because of their outstanding optoelectronic properties.1–5 The excellent optoelectronic properties of lead-based hybrid perovskites are mainly derived from the 6s2p0 electronic state of Pb2+.6–8 The lead component leads to a suitable band-gap, large absorption coefficient, dispersive band edge, and large dielectric constant. Despite the enormous success achieved by lead-based perovskites, the toxicity of the Pb component and their instability upon exposure to moisture or oxygen severely hinder their commercialization.9–13
Various efforts have been devoted to develop Pb-free perovskite materials.14 As they are from the same group as Pb in the periodic table, one simple approach is to first choose germanium (Ge) and tin (Sn) as Pb-free alternatives. The PCE of Sn-based perovskite solar cells has exceeded 12%.15 Unfortunately, Sn-based or Ge-based perovskites exhibit poor stability because the divalent Ge/Sn can be easily oxidized into tetravalent Ge/Sn.16 As an adjacent element, Bi has also been chosen in Pb-free alternatives.17–19 Bi-based perovskites have promising optoelectronic properties and excellent stability. However, their optical bandgaps are estimated to be >2 eV, which limits their application in solar cells.
In the vast array of potential lead-free perovskites, materials with the ns2 electronic configuration can have appropriate band gaps, dispersive bands, and large dielectric constant.20–25 Thus, halides and chalcogenides of Ge2+, Sn2+, Sb3+, Bi3+, and In3+ have been widely studied as nontoxic photovoltaic materials.14,26–29 Specifically, typical metal compounds including a halide and chalcogenide together also have many interesting properties such as non-toxicity, stability, a direct band-gap, and a large dielectric constant.30–34 Ternary thioiodides, including SbSI and Sb0.67Bi0.33SI, have successfully been prepared and applied to solar cells.32 Recently, quaternary thioiodides such as Sn2SbS2I3 have aroused interest due to their high stability, suitable bandgaps and high electrical resistivities.35–37
In this work, we proposed a series of quaternary thioiodide materials, M22+M3+S2I3, and studied their structural and optoelectronic properties through systematic first-principles calculations to identify potentially superior photovoltaic materials. We systematically study a broader range of trivalent elements and bivalent elements by considering combinations of M2+ (Ca2+, Sr2+, Ba2+, Zn2+, Cd2+, Cu2+, Ti2+, and Sn2+) and M3+ (In3+, Bi3+, and Sb3+). A total of 24 candidates are studied, including two materials, Sn2SbS2I3 and Sn2BiS2I3, that have been synthesized and applied in solar cells.30–37 The calculation results show that their band-gaps can be tuned from the infrared to ultraviolet. It is found that four optimal compounds possessing direct bandgaps below 1.6 eV are promising photovoltaic materials. More importantly, these materials have high permittivity, small effective mass, and low exciton binding energy, which are favorable for photovoltaic application. Especially, Sn2InS2I3 has a direct band-gap of 1.18 eV and the highest spectroscopic limited maximum efficiency (SLME) of 33.41%. This work provides further guidance in the search for stable and lead-free solar cell absorbers to replace lead-based perovskites.
Computational methods
First-principles density-functional theory (DFT) calculations were conducted using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP).38,39 The core and valence electronic interactions were described using frozen-core projector augmented-wave (PAW) potentials.40 The Kohn–Sham one electron states were expanded in plane waves with a kinetic energy of up to 500 eV. The exchange correlation energy was calculated with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) generalized gradient approximation (GGA).41 The energy convergence of electronic calculations adopted a tolerance of 10−5 eV. The kinetic energy cutoffs for the plane-wave basis set were optimized to ensure that the residual forces on atoms converged to below 0.01 eV Å−1. The van der Waals (vdW) interaction of the DFT-D3 method was used to describe the interlayer interaction in layer-structured materials.42,43 A Γ-centered k-point sampling of 8 × 2 × 2 for Brillouin zone integration was generated using the Monkhorst–Pack scheme. Due to the tendency of PBE functionals to severely underestimate band gaps, the Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof hybrid functional (HSE06) was employed.44 Furthermore, the spin orbit coupling (SOC) effect, which is critical to account for the relativistic effect in the Bi 6p orbitals, was also considered. Therefore, the band gaps were calculated in three ways, i.e., PBE, PBE + SOC, and HSE06 + SOC. Dielectric constants were calculated using the density functional perturbation theory (DFPT) method with the PBE functional.45 The electronic structures and optical absorption spectra were calculated by taking the SOC effect into account, with the Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE) hybrid functional remedying the underestimation of band gaps. The COHP analyses are used for chemical bonding analyses, implemented using the LOBSTER package.46,47 To give an evaluation of photovoltaic performance of the selected optimal materials, the theoretical maximum solar cell efficiency, i.e., “spectroscopic limited maximum efficiency (SLME)”48 was calculated.
Results and discussion
Firstly, geometry optimizations were performed for M22+M3+S2I3 in Cmc21 space groups with M2+ (Ca, Sr, Ba, Sn, Zn, Cu, Ti, and Cd) and M3+ (including Sb, Bi, and In). The relaxed crystal structures are provided in Fig. 1. In the Cmc21 crystal structure, the coordination environments of M3+ and M2+ (to a lesser extent) shift to form connected chains of formula units (M22+M3+S2I3)n along the a direction, as M3+ atoms attach to (M22+S2I2)n layers. The polymorphs have similar a and b cell lengths, with the greatest difference occurring along the c direction. The optimized lattice constants of Sb-based, Bi-based, and In-based M22+M3+S2I3 using PBE schemes are shown in Tables S1–S3 in the ESI,† respectively. To evaluate the thermodynamic stabilities of M22+M3+S2I3, we calculated their decomposition energies with respect to possible decomposition pathways.34 Usually, the quaternary thioiodides can be synthesized via their inverse reaction. Herein, the decomposition enthalpy is defined asΔH = 2E[M2+S] + E[M3+I3] − E[M22+M3+S2I3]i.e., ΔH is the energy difference between the decomposed binary products and the M22+M3+S2I3. Here, a positive value of ΔH denotes that the decomposition of M22+M3+S2I3 needs to gain energy, reflecting the material's good thermodynamic stability. Fig. 2a shows the decomposition enthalpy (ΔH) of M22+M3+S2I3. It is obvious that most of the M22+M3+S2I3 units possess fairly large positive values of above 60 meV atom−1. Obviously, the Sn-containing materials have the largest values of ΔH above 180 meV atom−1, and the Cd-, Ca- and Sr-containing materials have relatively lower ΔH compared to the Sn-containing materials. However, there are some exceptional cases with small and even negative ΔH in the Zn- and Ba-containing materials. All Cu- and Ti-containing materials show relatively poor stability. Clearly, the Sn-containing materials are the most thermodynamically stable, consistent with the fact that Sn2SbS2I3 and Sn2BiS2I3 have been experimentally synthesized. Therefore, a total of 15 materials show impressive stability.

Following the study of the stability, the electronic properties of M22+M3+S2I3 were also examined. In terms of the specific electron configuration of M3+, the family of these main chemical species can be classified into two categories: (i) Sb3+ and Bi3+ having empty p and full s outmost orbitals, and (ii) In3+ possessing empty 5s orbitals, empty 5p orbitals and full 4d outmost orbitals. In terms of M2+, the family mainly includes the group IIA elements (Ca, Sr, and Ba), the group IV elements (Sn), the group IB elements (Cu), the group IVB elements (Ti), and the group IIB elements (Zn and Cd).
The band gap is a key parameter of photovoltaics materials. We first calculated the band gap variation of these materials using the three different methods, including PBE, PBE + SOC, and HSE + SOC methods. The calculated band gaps of Sb-based, Bi-based, and In-based M22+M3+S2I3 using different methods are shown in Tables S1–S3 in the ESI,† respectively. Taking into consideration the severely underestimated band gaps using the PBE functional, the calculated band gaps remedied via the HSE06 + SOC method are closer to the experimental values. The calculated band gaps of M22+M3+S2I3 are shown in Fig. 3.
 Fig. 3  Calculated band gaps of M22+M3+S2I3 compounds (M3+ = Sb, Bi, In, M2+ = Ca, Sr, Ba, Sn, Zn, Cd) using the HSE functional with spin–orbit coupling. The dashed line marks the suitable band gap (less than 1.6 eV) for a single-junction solar cell. An asterisk denotes a direct band-gap. 
According to the Shockley–Queisser theory, outstanding solar absorbers require the optimal band gap in the range from 1.1 eV to 1.6 eV. In Fig. 3, the dashed line marks the limit of a suitable band gap (less than 1.6 eV) for a single-junction solar cell, and the asterisk denotes the direct band gap material. According to the categories of M3+, we first investigated the band structures of Sb/Bi-based M22+BiS2I3. For Sb-based materials, it is obvious that Sn2SbS2I3, Cd2SbS2I3, Ca2SbS2I3, Sr2SbS2I3, and Ba2SbS2I3 can satisfy the requirements of the band gap (less than 1.6 eV). Among these materials, Sn2SbS2I3 and Cd2SbS2I3 possess a direct band-gap, which are in favour of light absorption of photovoltaic materials. For Bi-based M22+BiS2I3. It is found that Sn2BiS2I3, Ca2BiS2I3, and Sr2BiS2I3 possess suitable band-gaps for solar cells, and Sn2BiS2I3 is the only direct band-gap Bi-based material. For In-based M22+InS2I3, it can be seen that most of the materials have large bandgaps of above 2 eV, and five of the In-based cases have direct band gaps. Among the In-based M22+InS2I3 materials, Sn2InS2I3 has a direct band gap of 1.18 eV, which is suitable for Pb-free photovoltaic materials. Totally, nine potential M22+M3+S2I3, including four direct band-gap materials (Sn2SbS2I3, Cd2SbS2I3, Sn2BiS2I3, and Sn2InS2I3) and five indirect band-gap materials (Ca2SbS2I3, Ca2BiS2I3, Sr2SbS2I3, Sr2BiS2I3, and Ba2SbS2I3), can be used to replace lead-based perovskites.
Due to the mixing of M2+ and M3+ ions in the quaternary thioiodides, the M22+M3+S2I3 family shows more complicated electronic structures than those of the ternary AM2+X3. We offer a detailed discussion in terms of the three categories mentioned above, including Sb-based, Bi-based, and In-based M22+M3+S2I3 materials. For the Sb-based M22+M3+S2I3 cases, Fig. 4a displays the band structure of Cd2SbS2I3 with the PBE scheme. It shows that the band gap of Cd2SbS2I3 is 1.0 eV, which is direct at the Γ high-symmetry point. When considering the SOC effect, the band gap is reduced to 0.91 eV, as displayed in Fig. S1a of the ESI.† Due to the underestimation of band gaps using the PBE functional, the calculated band gaps should be remedied using the HSE06 + SOC method. The remedied band gap reaches 1.52 eV, as shown in Fig. 3. Thus, Cd2SbS2I3 is a promising candidate for a Pb-free photovoltaic material. When M2+ is changed from Cd to Sn, the band gaps of Sn2SbS2I3 become 0.71 eV with the PBE scheme, as shown in Fig. S2a (ESI†). Yet the band gaps remedied by HSE + SOC become 1.26 eV. Experimentally, Sn2SbS2I3 have been successfully applied in solar cells as potential photovoltaic materials.37 Besides, we have also studied the electronic structures of suitable indirect band-gap Sb-based M22+M3+S2I3 cases. The indirect band gap of less than 1.6 eV mainly includes the materials Ca2SbS2I3, Ba2SbS2I3, and Sr2SbS2I3, as shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). It is found that Ca/Ba/Sr-based quaternary thioiodides have almost similar band gaps (∼1.5 eV), which are suitable as photovoltaic materials.
 Fig. 4  Electronic band structures and projected density of states of new quaternary thioiodides based on M3+ = Sb, Bi, and In: (a) and (d) for Cd2SbS2I3, (b) and (e) for Sn2BiS2I3, (c) and (f) for Sn2InS2I3. 
The orbital-projected density of states was further studied, as illustrated in Fig. 4 and Fig. S2a (ESI†). For Cd2SbS2I3, it is observed that the valence band maximum (VBM) is mainly contributed by the hybridization between Sb 5s-S 3p and Sb 5s-I 5p orbitals. From the crystal orbital Hamilton population (COHP) analysis in Fig. S3 (ESI†), it can be deduced that the VBM has a strong antibonding character. The conduction band minimum (CBM) mainly originates from the hybridization between Cd 5s orbitals and S 3p orbitals, which also have an antibonding character. When M2+ is changed from Cd to Sn, there is an obvious difference in the projected density of states. In the Sn2SbS2I3 case, the VBM is a mix of the antibonding states of Sn 5s-I 5p states and Sn 5s-S 3p states (see Fig. S2, and S4 in the ESI†) while the CBM derives mainly from the antibonding states between the Sb 5p orbital and the I 5p orbital. As for the three Sb-based indirect band-gap cases, the VBMs are mainly composed of Sb 5s-I 5p and Sb 5s-S 3p hybridization states, while the CBMs are mainly originated from the Sb 5p states, as shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†).
For Bi-based M22+M3+S2I3 cases, Sn2BiS2I3 has a suitable direct solar cell band gap (less than 1.6 eV) as Pb-free photovoltaic absorber materials. Their electronic band structures calculated using PBE are shown in Fig. 4b, which shows that the band gap of Sn2BiS2I3 is 0.71 eV. When considering the SOC effect, the band gap is reduced to 0.36 eV, as displayed in Fig. S1b of the ESI.† For solving the underestimation of band gaps, the band gap is remedied using the HSE06 + SOC method. Finally, a band gap of 1.09 eV is obtained for Sn2BiS2I3, which is very close to the experimental value of 1.2 eV.34 The direct and suitable band gap of Sn2BiS2I3 ensures its potential as a promising photovoltaic absorber material. The analysis of constituent contributions to band-edge states indicates that the character of the VBM and CBM of Sn2BiS2I3 is analogous to that of Sn2SbS2I3. The VBM are mainly dominated by the antibonding state between Sn 5s and the I 5p/S 3p orbitals (see Fig. 4b and Fig. S5 in the ESI†) while the CBM mainly originates from the antibonding states between the Bi 6p and I 5p orbitals. As for the two Bi-based indirect band-gap cases, it is found that Ca2BiS2I3 and Sr2BiS2I3 possess analogous band structures, as shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†). The further projected density of states analysis shows that the bivalent metals Ca/Sr contribute little to the VBM and CBM, while Bi 6s-I 5p and Bi 6s-S 3p hybridization states dominates the VBM and the Bi 6p states contribute the most to the CBM.
For In-based M22+M3+S2I3 cases, Sn2InS2I3 is the only lead-free candidate for a solar cell absorber material in consideration of the band gaps. The calculated band gap of Sn2InS2I3 using PBE is only 0.6 eV in Fig. 4c. The band gap increases to 1.18 eV using the HSE06 + SOC method, which is also suitable for a photovoltaic material. Then, the constituent contributions to band-edge states were also studied, as shown in Fig. 4f and Fig. S7 (ESI†). It is obvious that the VBM is also contributed by Sn 5s and S 3p and I 5p orbitals. The COHP analysis shows that the VBM are mainly dominated by the bonding state between Sn 5s and the I 5p/S 3p orbitals. The CBM is contributed by Sn 5p, In 5s, S 3p and I 5p orbitals. And the COHP analysis shows that the CBM are mainly in the antibonding state.
The dielectric constants of these cases have also been calculated, as shown in Table 1. Due to the orthorhombic lattice symmetry, the dielectric responses of these materials are anisotropic. The high-frequency optical constants (ε∞) are mostly distributed from 5 to 9. The ionic contributions to the static dielectric constant (ε0) have much larger values, especially along the X direction. Obviously, the static dielectric responses (εstd) are close to those of Pb-based perovskites, e.g., εstd = 70 in MAPbI3. Specifically, Cd2SbS2I3 possesses high static dielectric tensors, i.e., εxxstd = 43.34, εyystd = 15.08, εzzstd = 115.45, which exceed the static dielectric constant of Pb-based perovskites. From Tables S4–S6 (ESI†), it is found that the other quaternary thioiodides also have relatively high dielectric constants. As in Pb-based perovskites, the giant static dielectric constants of these cases can provide a strong screen for charged defects and impurities. Thus, the high dielectric constant can effectively suppress carrier trapping and carrier scattering and improve the performance of optoelectronic materials.

Next, the electronic properties of these potential photovoltaic materials were further investigated. The effective masses (m*) provide an estimation of the ambipolar carrier conduction and carrier extraction efficiency. Usually, it is believed that both the hole and electron effective masses should be less than 1.0 m0 in a potentially superior solar absorber. The effective masses of carriers can be estimated according to the band structure. The effective mass is evaluated by the equation m* = ħ2/(∂2E/∂2k) (where ħ is the reduced Planck constant, E is the wave function, and k is the magnitude of the wave vector in momentum space). The calculated hole and electron masses are summarized in Table 1. For Sb-based M22+M3+S2I3 (including Sn2SbS2I3 and Cd2SbS2I3), Sn2SbS2I3 have small effective masses along the x and y directions for holes and electrons, while much larger hole and electron masses are evaluated along the z direction. However, Cd2SbS2I3 possesses small hole and electron effective masses along the y and z directions, but a much larger hole effective mass along the x direction. For Sn2BiS2I3 small electron effective masses and heavy hole effective masses are obtained for all directions. For Sn2InS2I3, small electron and hole effective masses are obtained for z direction, while much larger hole effective than electron masses are obtained for the x and y directions. The effective masses of the other quaternary thioiodides also have been provided in Tables S4–S6 (ESI†). These results suggest that these candidates may possess superior carrier transportation along specific directions.
Moreover, the Wannier–Mott exciton binding energies (Eb) can be used to evaluate the charge separation ability after light absorption. The small exciton binding energy (<100 meV) can ensure fast photon-induced carrier dissociation. Eb is estimated based on the effective mass theory using a modified hydrogen-atom-like Bohr model as Eb = μe4/2ħ2ε2, where ε is the high-frequency dielectric constant, μ the reduced effective mass of the exciton calculated according to , and e is the charge of an electron. The exciton binding energies of these direct band-gap quaternary thioiodides are shown in Table 1. Relatively small Eb were estimated for the four potential photovoltaic materials because of the large dielectric constants. In addition, Eb of the other quaternary thioiodides have been calculated in Tables S4–S6 (ESI†). From exciton binding energy analysis, it is concluded that Sn2SbS2I3, Cd2SbS2I3, Sn2BiS2I3, and Sn2InS2I3 all should possess better charge separation ability in photovoltaic devices.
After the initial stability and electronic property screening, Sn2SbS2I3, Cd2SbS2I3, Sn2BiS2I3, and Sn2InS2I3 are promising candidates for solar cell applications. Based on above analysis, we further studied the stability of the four candidates by considering the other possible decomposition pathways of M22+M3+S2I3 into ternary compounds. As shown in Fig. 2b, the decomposition enthalpies, ΔH, of four stable M22+M3+S2I3 are all positive, which further demonstrate their thermodynamic stabilities. The ternary phase decomposition pathways are shown in eqn (1–7) in the ESI.† The phonon band structures of the four candidates are also calculated to evaluate their dynamic stability. As shown in Fig. S8 (ESI†), three out of four candidates have no imaginary frequencies, i.e., Sn2SbS2I3, Sn2BiS2I3, and Sn2InS2I3. No appearance of imaginary frequencies demonstrates the local dynamic stability. But the appearance of imaginary frequencies of Cd2SbS2I3 may be removed via mode-mapping or considering finite-temperature effects. Therefore, these four materials can be used as potential photovoltaic materials.
In addition to phase stability, ideal band gap, smaller effective masses, and low exciton binding energy, a superior solar absorber should also display excellent optical properties. High light-absorption efficiency is essential for high photoelectric conversion efficiency (PCE). In order to evaluate the optical absorption properties of M22+M3+S2I3, the absorption spectra of these four potential materials are further calculated, along with that of five indirect band gap materials and MAPbI3 for comparison. As shown in Fig. 5a, the direct band-gap quaternary thioiodides, namely Sn2SbS2I3 Sn2BiS2I3, Sn2InS2I3, and Cd2SbS2I3, exhibit strong absorption edges due to their suitable band gap and direct-gap nature. It is obvious that Sn2InS2I3 has the strongest absorption ability in the visible light region. Compared to the direct type ones, the indirect band-gap quaternary thioiodides, namely Ca2SbS2I3, Ca2BiS2I3, Sr2SbS2I3, Sr2BiS2I3, and Ba2SbS2I3, show reduced absorption edges.

(b) Simulated theoretical maximum solar cell efficiency, i.e., “spectroscopic limited maximum efficiency” (SLME) of M22+M3+S2I3 whose bandgaps are less than 1.6 eV as a function of film thickness. 
It has been mentioned previously that the optical absorption coefficient plays a significant role in photovoltaic materials. The absorption coefficient and thickness of the absorb layer are taken into consideration together when evaluating the theoretical maximum efficiency using the “spectroscopic limited maximum efficiency (SLME)” method, as plotted in Fig. 5b. It is obvious that the four direct band-gap quaternary thioiodides exhibit similarly sharply increasing SLME with the increasing film thickness, similar to MAPbI3. The SLME of Sn2InS2I3 reaches 33.4% at the film thickness of 1 μm. In addition, all SLMEs of the other four quaternary thioiodides are above 30%, which slightly surpasses the 29% of CH3NH3PbI3. This is attributed to the strong absorption and band gap proximal to that of CH3NH3PbI3. Compared with the direct band-gap quaternary thioiodides, the indirect band-gap quaternary thioiodides show a smooth gradual increasing SLME with the increasing film thickness. This is attributed to their reduced absorption intensity near the threshold. Eventually, the SLME values of these five indirect band-gap quaternary thioiodides have exceeded 20% at a film thickness of 1 μm. At a thin film thickness of 3 μm, their SLME values reach approximately 28%. Hence, it is believed that quaternary thioiodides may be new promising good solar absorbers.
Conclusions
In summary, we have studied Pb-free quaternary thioiodides M22+M3+S2I3 similar to perovskites that possess ns2 lone-pair cations and stronger metal–chalcogen bonds for discovering promising solar cell absorbers. By systematic first-principles calculations, it is found that this class of M22+M3+S2I3 materials exhibits good phase stability against different decomposition pathways. Further calculations showed that Sn2SbS2I3, Sn2BiS2I3, Sn2InS2I3, and Cd2SbS2I3 have superior stabilities, suitable band gaps (<1.6 eV, direct band gaps), dispersive band structures, and large dielectric constants, as needed for promising excellent photovoltaic materials. The SLME of four direct band gap candidates all exceeds 30%. Especially, that of Sn2InS2I3 is above 33%, which is even superior to that of MAPbI3. This work further expands the family of the eco-friendly solar cell materials, and further efforts towards their experimental synthesis and theoretical calculation will widen the range of their potential for access to electronic applications.
