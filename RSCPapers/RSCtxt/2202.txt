    , Accepted 26th September 2014First published on 30th September 2014AbstractTwo novel symmetrical blue squaraine sensitizers were synthesized, which exhibit panchromatic light harvesting and a record efficiency over 6% with Jsc exceeding 14 mA cm−2, and Voc over 620 mV under 1 sun. Their color, low cost, easiness of synthesis, and relatively high photo- and thermal stability open up the way for commercial applications.
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs)1 provide a significant low-cost alternative to conventional photovoltaics. State-of-the-art DSCs based on molecular dyes are currently characterized by solar-to-electric power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 10–13%.2,3 In DSCs, one of the most critical components is the sensitizer and its spectral response to further increase PCEs. Therefore, it is of paramount importance to molecularly engineer and develop sensitizers, combining the easiness of synthesis and increased light-harvesting ability in the near-infrared (NIR) region.4
A number of metal-free dyes have so far been developed5 due to the high molar extinction coefficient (ε) and the absence of rare and expensive metals. Their chemical structures and relative photovoltaic performance relationships have been examined.6 NIR dyes could find interesting applications both in photovoltaic windows and in tandem panchromatic solar cells.7,8 Among them, squaraine dyes are well known for their intense absorption and their relative photo- and thermal stability.9 The most performing near-IR squaraine dyes reported so far in the literature are unsymmetrical structures (JK216,10YR6,11JD1012), exhibiting panchromatic light harvesting and cell efficiencies of around 6–7% (see Fig. S1, ESI†).
However we successfully demonstrated that symmetrical squaraine dyes13 have similar efficiency in the cell to the related unsymmetrical structures with the evident advantages of easiness of synthesis, purification and possible industrial scale-up due to the inherent low cost. In fact, the syntheses of the previously cited unsymmetrical squaraines require several synthetic steps via difficult and expensive carbon–carbon coupling.
Dibranched symmetrical dyes14 have been claimed to enhance the stability due to the higher number of anchoring groups. Unfortunately, until now, none of these dibranched sensitizers showed an efficient photon-to-current conversion in the NIR region (see Table S1, ESI† for an overview of the structures and relative photovoltaics records available in literature). Moreover, a symmetrical and conformational locked squaraine structure, due to a cis conformation, can lead to a significantly enhanced short-circuit current density as proved by us13 and more recently by Maeda and Han.15
Herein we report the synthesis and optical, electronic, and photovoltaic properties of two simple symmetrical bis(benzoindolenine) squaraine sensitizers coded VG10-C2 and VG10-C8 (Fig. 1a and Scheme S1, ESI†), which incorporate, for the first time, two carboxylic acid each directly conjugated to the benzoindolenine moieties instead of having it in the N-alkyl substituents,16 or on a simple indolenine.17 The corresponding unknown unsymmetrical squaraine VG13 was also synthesized for a comparison (Fig. 1a and Scheme S2, ESI†). The benzoindoleninium derivative was prepared via a simple and high yield Fischer indole synthesis18 and a subsequent nitrogen alkylation (see ESI† for full details). The benzoindoleninium salt was then reacted with squaric acid to obtain the symmetrical squaraines VG10-C2 and VG10-C8. Very recently, we set up quaternization reactions and the syntheses of indolenine-based squaraine dyes by means of a single mode microwave reactor.19 This allowed us to drastically reduce time (from days to minutes), increase yields (more than two-fold improvement in product yields when compared to conventional methods) and purity. A simple crystallization of the crude symmetrical and unsymmetrical products yielded a very low cost and industrially scalable product (for a detailed account see the synthetic procedures in the ESI†).
 Fig. 1  (a) Structures of symmetrical squaraines VG10-C2 and VG10-C8 and unsymmetrical squaraine VG13. VG1-C8 structure is reported for comparison. (b) Absorption spectra of VG10-C2 (solid black line), VG10-C8 (dashed red line), VG13 (solid green line) and VG1-C8 (dotted blue line) in ethanol. 

VG10 dyes exhibit an absorption maximum at around 673 nm in ethanol (Fig. 1b) with a very high molar absorption coefficient (around 300000 M−1 cm−1). A red shift of about 20 nm with respect to the symmetrical VG1-C8 is consistent with the expected effect of extending conjugation owing to the benzocondensed indoleninium moiety.
The ground-state oxidation (E(S+/S)) and reduction potential (Ered) of the new symmetrical dyes (VG10-C2 and VG10-C8) were evaluated by cyclic voltammetry to be at same potentials, using ferrocene (Fc) as an internal standard. The (E(S+/S)) level (at 0.06 V vs. Fc, see Fig. 2) indicates that dye regeneration by iodide species is energetically favourable. The E(red) level (at −1.50 V vs. Fc), being more negative than the conduction band of TiO2, is positioned favourably for efficient electron injection. On the other hand, VG13 oxidation is very close to Fc redox potential, while the reduction is at −1.60 V vs. Fc. Looking at the molecular structure of the different dyes it is evident that symmetrical systems always show more stabilized ground and excited states with respect to the corresponding unsymmetrical structures (VG1vs.SQ0113 and VG10vs.VG13). On the contrary, the introduction of benzoindolenine moieties instead of indolenine ones induced an unexpected destabilization of both the ground and excited state levels (VG10vs.VG1) (Fig. 2). Electrochemical data are consistent with the bathochromic shifts observed in the spectroscopic analysis (Fig. 1b).

In order to elucidate the origin of the spectroscopic properties of the dye we have performed a theoretical analysis using time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) calculations taking into account bulk solvent effects (see ESI,† part 5).20–22
DFT geometry optimization suggests that the VG10-C2 molecule can exist in several stable conformational isomers differing by a rotation of 180° around the double bonds of the polymethine-like chain (Fig. S4, ESI†). The two most stable isomers are shown in Fig. 3, the energy of the cis isomer being only 0.7 kcal mol−1 higher than that of the trans isomer. The computed electronic spectrum of the trans isomer in DMSO shows a strong absorption at 661 nm corresponding to an excitation to the first excited singlet state (S1). The result is in excellent agreement with the observed band at 683 nm (Table S4, ESI†). The calculated transition energy is higher than the experimental data by about 0.06 eV, and confirms a trend which has already been reported in previous studies based on TD-DFT.13,23 The S1 singlet state is described almost entirely by a valence HOMO–LUMO transition, which is in agreement with the relatively small Stokes shifts observed.24 This can be clearly seen by looking at the isosurfaces of the molecular orbitals displayed in Fig. 3. Indeed, the HOMO and LUMO correspond to valence π and π* orbitals respectively which mainly involve the squarainic ring and the polymethine-like chain, as also found by other authors.13,25 Calculations of the absorption spectrum in THF predict a blue shift of the S0–S1 transition to 644 nm, again in good agreement with the experimental value of 676 nm. Similar results hold for the other isomers (see ESI†).

The above analysis suggests that the excited state of VG10, which is involved in the electron injection into the TiO2, has only a minor CT character. Further studies are in progress to understand the nature of the electronic coupling between the dye and the semiconductor.
Dibranched symmetrical squaraine dyes can show a double-anchored linking by the two carboxylic groups.13,15 The comparison between ATR–FTIR spectra of the dyes alone and absorbed on the electrode (Fig. S5, ESI†) exhibits, in the case of VG10-C2, the disappearance of the strong absorption band observed at 1702 cm−1, which can be attributed to the CO stretching of an aromatic carboxylic acid. On the contrary, the long chain dye (VG10-C8) spectrum still shows a non-obvious behavior (a peak and a shoulder) which can suggest that the double anchoring mode is not complete. In fact, the conformational changes in solution for the two molecules are strongly affected by the length of the alkyl chains as confirmed by NMR spectra (Fig. S6 and S7, ESI†).
The double anchoring most likely takes place when the squaraine is in its cis configuration. This is further substantiated by the increase in the absorbance at around 400 nm after VG10 is adsorbed on the electrode, which is not the case for unsymmetrical system (Fig. 4). Indeed, the results of TD-DFT calculations suggest that the cis isomer has the largest absorption in that energy region (Table S4, ESI†), thus an increase in absorbance would be associated to an increase in the concentration of the cis isomer. Analogous results have been recently obtained for the theoretical analysis of the bis(indolenine) squaraine spectral lineshapes.26

Table 1 and Fig. 5 report photovoltaic performances obtained with the three dyes. Best results from optimized devices showed Jsc exceeding 14 mA cm−2, Voc over 620 mV and corresponding efficiencies of 6.18, 6.11 and 5.50% with VG10-C2, VG10-C8 and VG13 respectively (Table 1). The effect of CDCA27 addition on the photocurrent is manifest, for the three dyes, in the incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE), where a dramatic increase is shown (Fig. 5b). The efficiency improvement, highlighted in the presence of co-adsorbent, is higher for the symmetrical systems due to the evident gain in Jsc between 400 and 500 nm (see Fig. 5b). Due to this particular behaviour, surprisingly both symmetrical dyes are significantly more efficient than the unsymmetrical reference system.

Particularly interesting and in line with our previous results,13 the unsymmetrical system shows the highest voltage while symmetrical ones the highest current. Moreover, the effect of the length of the chain is also reflected in the Jsc and Voc parameters yielding a higher Voc for long chains and a slightly higher current for the short ones. A transient study confirmed that the solar cells in the presence of CDCA show increases in the electron lifetime, by one order of magnitude, which is in agreement with previous studies28 (Fig. S8a, ESI†). Hence, the higher Voc of the VG10-C8 sensitized solar cell in the presence of CDCA is attributed to the enhanced electron lifetime. All chemical capacitances of devices nearly overlap (Fig. S8b, ESI†) and this result implies that there is upward or downward shift movement of the TiO2 conduction band (CB) edge. Therefore, the higher Voc of VG10-C8 compared to those of VG10-C2 is most likely due to an increase in electron lifetime owing to the presence of a long alkyl chain. The non-obvious behaviour of the symmetrical dyes in the presence of CDCA at a high energy wavelength can be attributed to the different conformations on the surface, as anticipated from DFT calculations and experimental results on electrode absorption. These features highlight the significance of fundamental studies on the conformation of sensitizers.29
The stability of organic sensitizers, NIR dyes in particular, is still a great challenge in DSC technology.30 To our knowledge reports on the stability of squaraine dyes10,15b used a 420 nm cut-off filter to prevent dye degradation, highlighting that photostability is the main issue for NIR dyes. In our case, looking at the photostability of the different synthesized squaraines directly on the photoelectrode, we realized that symmetrical squaraines are more stable than the corresponding unsymmetrical squaraines, even without a cut-off filter, probably due to the dibranched structure. Moreover, as evident in Fig. S9 (ESI†), the presence of a benzoindolenine moiety and long chains also have a role in the stability of the molecule on the TiO2 surface. Intrigued by these results we also tested the thermal stability (Fig. S10, ESI†), which confirms the same behavior. These attractive and promising outcomes deserve an in-depth study to confirm the structure/property relationship.
Conclusions
We molecularly engineered a series of near-IR squaraine sensitizers (VG10 and VG13), containing the novel benzoindolenine moiety functionalized with COOH as an efficient attaching group. These dyes show panchromatic light harvesting in the range between 400 to 800 nm. The obtained efficiency of 6.2% is an outstanding value considering the easy and efficient low cost synthesis. We note that symmetric squaraines show 10% higher efficiency than the corresponding unsymmetrical one, mainly due to the higher photocurrents, derived from the adopted cis conformation on the electrode surface, as confirmed by spectroscopic data and TD_DFT computational analysis. The first photo- and thermo stability data reveal the superior behavior of VG10 symmetrical molecules. This study opens up a new avenue for a large number of optimized symmetrical squaraine structures.
