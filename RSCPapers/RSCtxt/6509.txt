    , Accepted 4th November 2019First published on 6th November 2019AbstractTwo n-type organic semiconductor (n-OS) acceptors, C8-SF and Y-MODF, were designed and synthesized for application in organic solar cells (OSCs). C8-SF shows a lower lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level and lower bandgap with an absorption edge at 822 nm. Y-MODF possesses a relatively larger bandgap and higher LUMO and lower HOMO (highest occupied molecular orbital) energy levels than C8-SF. With the polymer PM6 as the donor, the OSC with C8-SF as the acceptor delivers a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.59% with a lower open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.787 V, while the device with Y-MODF as the acceptor exhibits a lower PCE of 8.63% but a higher Voc of 0.984 V benefitting from the higher LUMO of the Y-MODF acceptor. Then, a series of ternary OSCs were fabricated with PM6:C8-SF as the host system and Y-MODF as a third component. The optimal ternary OSCs with 25% Y-MODF incorporated into the acceptor achieve a higher PCE of 13.39%, with an improved Voc of 0.845 V, a Jsc of 20.88 mA cm−2 and a FF of 75.87%. It was found that adding Y-MODF to the PM6:C8-SF binary system suppressed monomolecular recombination and improved the utilization of 450–600 nm range photons. Molecular packing is further optimized with more balanced hole and electron transport, thus resulting in the enhanced Jsc and FF for the ternary OSCs. These results indicate that the addition of a wide bandgap acceptor with a higher LUMO energy level to a binary donor/acceptor system may have potential for Voc and PCE improvement of ternary OSCs.
Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs), with the advantages of flexibility, light weight and semi-transparency, have achieved great progress in recent decades.1–5 The power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of single junction OSCs based on a wide bandgap p-type conjugated polymer as the donor and a narrow bandgap n-type organic semiconductor (n-OS) as the acceptor have reached 15–16%,6–9 which is the efficiency threshold for practical application of OSCs. The significant PCE improvement of the OSCs mainly comes from the development of high performance donor and acceptor materials,4,6,10–12 interface engineering,13–16 and device optimization.17–20 Recently, narrow-bandgap acceptors with the absorption edge red-shifted to near 1000 nm have attracted extensive attention for enlarging the light harvesting range to achieve a higher short-circuit current density (Jsc).21–24 However, reducing the bandgap will result in a lower-lying lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level (ELUMO) of the acceptor, which will lead to lower open-circuit voltage (Voc) of the devices, because the Voc of OSCs is proportional to the energy difference between the ELUMO of the acceptor and the EHOMO (highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level) of the donor.25–27 For example, with the same polymer PM6 as the donor,28 the Voc of the OSCs can reach 1.07 V with a Jsc of 14.20 mA cm−2 when IT-CC (ELUMO = −3.82 eV) was used as the acceptor, but when matched with the narrow bandgap acceptor IT-4Cl (ELUMO = −4.08 eV), the Voc reduced to 0.79 V with a higher Jsc value of 22.12 mA cm−2. If the Voc based on IT-4Cl could be improved without the reduction of Jsc, the PCE of the OSCs could be highly enhanced.
There are two ways to realize high Jsc and high Voc simultaneously. One way is to reduce the energy loss (Vloss) of the OSCs.2,29–31 For example, Hou's group7 reported two types of devices based on PBDB-TF:BTP-4F and PBDB-TF:BTP-4Cl. BTP-4Cl has a lower ELUMO and more red-shifted absorption than BTP-4F, but the OSC with BTP-4Cl as the acceptor showed a higher Voc with a smaller Vloss than the BTP-4F-based device. At present, the lowest Vloss of OSCs can reach 0.45 V,32 which is almost the ultimate value according to theoretical calculations.31,33,34 The second way of improving the Voc of OSCs is through devices with ternary components.35–38 As shown in Fig. S1 in the ESI,† the commonly investigated energy conversion mechanism in the two-acceptor ternary system includes the following:39–41 (1) the cascade LUMO and HOMO energy levels are formed to facilitate electron and hole transfer with more balanced mobility (called the charge transfer mechanism);42,43 (2) the photo-conversion process is dominated by the energy transfer process without strict requirement of cascade levels but enables effective exciton transfer at the interfaces among components with a higher diffusion length (called the energy transfer mechanism).44,45 In case (2), with optimized selection, a wide bandgap acceptor with higher ELUMO and lower EHOMO than the host acceptor can be introduced into the active layer.46 The overlap of absorption spectrum of the third component with those of the host system could occur, but the absorption intensity of the overlap can be increased.47 In addition, it is generally thought that Voc is proportional to the energy level offset (ΔEHOMO–LUMO) between the donor and acceptor, and efficient energy transfer between two acceptors provides more excitons generated in the narrow bandgap acceptor; thus Voc could be improved without sacrificing Jsc when a wide bandgap acceptor with a high ELUMO is used as the third component in binary OSCs.48,49 Although many ternary OSCs have been reported, most of the studies mainly focused on enhancing photon harvesting, which can be realized through the addition of the third component with complementary absorption.50–52 Creating more effective energy transfer pathways and maximally improving the Voc of binary OSCs by introducing a wider bandgap acceptor as a third component is another effective way to further improve the PCE of OSCs.53,54
Here, we design and synthesize a narrow bandgap acceptor C8-SF first. C8-SF is similar to C8-ITIC55 but with 2-(5,6-difluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene) malononitrile as the end groups of the acceptor. When PM6 (ref. 56) was used as the donor, the optimal binary device achieves a PCE of 11.53% with a Voc of 0.787 V, a Jsc of 20.03 mA cm−2 and a FF of 73.15%. In order to improve the Voc of the PM6:C8-SF based device, Y-MODF with a higher ELUMO was designed and synthesized. Y-MODF is an analogue of MO-IDIC-2F57 but with the central phenyl ring linked to the β-position of the thiophene ring and fused on its α-position. The wide bandgap Y-MODF possesses a similar absorption range as PM6 and the binary device based on PM6:Y-MODF shows a PCE of 8.63% with a Voc of 0.984 V, a Jsc of 12.30 mA cm−2 and a FF of 71.55%. The high Voc value benefitted from the high ELUMO of Y-MODF makes it an ideal third component in the targeted ternary system. When 25% of C8-SF in the binary OSC was replaced with Y-MODF, the optimized ternary device based on PM6:C8-SF:Y-MODF (1:0.9:0.3, w/w/w) gave a PCE of 13.39% with a Voc of 0.845 V, a Jsc of 20.88 mA cm−2 and a FF of 75.87%. This improvement of the PCE is mainly due to the increased Voc, which comes from the bigger difference between ELUMO of the acceptor Y-MODF and EHOMO of the donor PM6;35,36,58,59 the Jsc and FF were also improved because of the enhanced absorption in the shorter wavelength range and the improved morphology of the active layer. Even more, when 60% of C8-SF was replaced with Y-MODF, the PCE of the ternary OSCs can still achieve a higher value (11.69%) than that of host binary OSCs, which was attributed to the greatly improved Voc (from 0.787 V for the binary OSC to 0.889 V for the ternary OSC with 60% of Y-MODF in the acceptor component) without compromising Jsc. Our work demonstrated that Y-MODF is an effective wide bandgap acceptor that could be used as the third component in the ternary OSC for the purpose of increasing its Voc and PCE.
Results and discussion
Synthesis
Molecular structures of C8-SF and Y-MODF are shown in Fig. 1a. The detailed synthetic procedures are described in the Experimental section of the ESI.† The chemical structures of these compounds were characterized by 1H, 13C NMR and mass spectroscopy. These two n-OS acceptors can be dissolved in common organic solvents, such as tetrahydrofuran, chloroform, toluene, chlorobenzene, and o-dichlorobenzene at room temperature. In addition, as shown in Fig. S2 in the ESI,† the decomposition temperatures (5% weight loss) of C8-SF and Y-MODF are 324 °C and 340 °C, which indicate that C8-SF and Y-MODF possess good thermal stability for the application in OSCs.

Photophysical properties and electronic energy levels
Figure S3a† exhibits the absorption spectra of C8-SF and Y-MODF solutions. The absorption peaks of C8-SF and Y-MODF solutions are at 704 nm and 574 nm, respectively. Compared with solution absorption, the C8-SF film exhibits a broader absorption range, and the maximum absorption peak red-shifted from 704 nm to 759 nm (as shown in Fig. 1b) with a high absorption coefficient (ε) of 1.28 × 105 cm−1, which indicates the existence of strong π–π stacking interactions and ordered aggregations in the film. The Y-MODF film shows a narrow absorption range between 500 nm and 700 nm (Fig. 1b), which is covered in the absorption range of PM6, and the maximum absorption peak of Y-MODF (616 nm) is the same as that of PM6. The absorption coefficients (ε) of the Y-MODF and PM6 film are 1.08 × 105 cm−1 and 0.78 × 105 cm−1, respectively, as shown in Fig. S3b.† The absorption spectra of the PM6:C8-SF (1:1.2, w/w) blend film, PM6:Y-MODF (1:1.2, w/w) blend film and optimal PM6:C8-SF:Y-MODF (1:0.9:0.3, w/w/w) blend film are shown in Fig. S4.† It can be found that the PM6:C8-SF blend film shows intense absorption in the wavelength range of 500–800 nm with the maximum absorption peak at 760 nm and a weaker absorption peak at 612 nm. Due to the overlapped absorption of PM6 and Y-MODF, the PM6:Y-MODF film shows only one absorption peak at 601 nm and a narrow absorption range of 500–700 nm. Interestingly, the optimal PM6:C8-SF:Y-MODF ternary blend film shows a slightly blue-shifted (5 nm) absorption compared with the PM6:C8-SF binary blend film, and the maximum absorption peak changed from 760 nm to 612 nm, which could be ascribed to the overlapped absorption of PM6 and Y-MODF. This result indicates that the addition of Y-MODF enhanced the absorption in the shorter wavelength range, which could benefit photo-harvesting.
The highest occupied molecular orbital energy level (EHOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy level (ELUMO) of C8-SF and Y-MODF were measured by electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV). As shown in the cyclic voltammograms in Fig. S5,† the onset reduction potential (φred) and the onset oxidation potential (φox) of C8-SF are 1.19 and −0.29 V vs. Ag/AgCl, and the φred and φox of Y-MODF are 1.47 and −0.44 V vs. Ag/AgCl respectively. The redox potential of the ferrocene/ferrocenium couple (φ(Fc/Fc+)) is 0.46 V vs. Ag/AgCl. According to the equation EHOMO/LUMO = −e(φox/red − φ(Fc/Fc+) + 4.8) (eV), the EHOMO and ELUMO of C8-SF were calculated to be −5.53 and −4.05 eV, and the EHOMO and ELUMO of Y-MODF were calculated to be −5.81 eV and −3.90 eV, respectively (see Fig. 1c). The EHOMO and ELUMO of the C8-SF:Y-MODF (3:1, w/w) acceptor blend film were measured and calculated to be −5.60 and −4.00 eV respectively according to the cyclic voltammogram of the blend film as shown in Fig. S5.† The up-shifted ELUMO of the acceptor blend compared with C8-SF should be beneficial for achieving higher Voc in the ternary OSC.35,36,58,59 In addition, the up-shifted ELUMO of the acceptor blend film indicates that there could form some alloyed structure of the acceptor blend. In comparison with the PM6 donor (EHOMO of −5.49 eV and ELUMO of −3.60 eV), the HOMO energy level offset (ΔEHOMO) between PM6 and Y-MODF is 0.32 eV and the ΔEHOMO between PM6 and C8-SF is 0.04 eV.
It is generally accepted that a minimal ΔEHOMO of 0.3 eV is needed for efficient exciton dissociation between the donor and acceptor in fullerene-based OSCs, but it has been proven that 0.3 eV ΔEHOMO is not necessary for non-fullerene OSCs.12 In order to confirm the efficient exciton dissociation in the blend, photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the pristine PM6, C8-SF, and Y-MODF and their blend films were measured, as shown in Fig. 2a. It is observed that the PM6:C8-SF blend film shows a quenching efficiency of 99.4% at an excitation wavelength of 620 nm for the pristine PM6 film and 95.7% at an excitation wavelength of 760 nm for the pristine C8-SF film, indicating an effective charge transfer between PM6 and C8-SF regardless of the low ΔEHOMO of 0.04 eV between PM6 and C8-SF. The quenching efficiency (Equench) is calculated according to Equench = (1 − Pblend/Ppure) × 100%, where Ppure is the maximum PL intensity of the pure film and Pblend is the PL intensity of the blend film with the same excitation wavelength as that for measuring Ppure. The PM6:Y-MODF blend film shows a quenching efficiency of 94.4% at an excitation wavelength of 620 nm for the pristine PM6 film and 97.9% at an excitation wavelength of 610 nm for the pristine Y-MODF film. Furthermore, we measured the PL of the PM6:C8-SF:Y-MODF blend film. Compared with the binary blend film, it is interesting that higher quenching efficiencies of 99.8% and 99.5% for the pristine PM6 and Y-MODF films and a lower quenching efficiency of 93.4% for pristine C8-SF were observed in the ternary blend film. This result verifies a faster charge transfer for PM6 and Y-MODF but an accumulation of charge for C8-SF in the ternary blend film, which could come from the energy transfer from Y-MODF to C8-SF.

(c) The J–V characteristics of OSCs based on C8-SF:Y-MODF blend films with different weight ratios under simulated AM 1.5G irradiation (100 mW cm−2). 
To further investigate whether there is charge transfer or energy transfer between Y-MODF and C8-SF, we measured the PL spectra of pristine Y-MODF, C8-SF and their blend films with different weight ratios under 610 nm excitation wavelength. As shown in Fig. 2b, Y-MODF exhibits broad and strong PL emission at ∼680 nm, but C8-SF shows a relatively weak emission at ∼820 nm because of the unmatched excitation wavelength. In the Y-MODF:C8-SF blend films, adding Y-MODF to C8-SF makes the PL intensity of Y-MODF decrease to nearly zero but in the meantime, the PL intensity at ∼820 nm gradually increases compared to the PL intensity of the pure C8-SF film since Y-MODF is a wide bandgap component, and the range of PL emission wavelength is almost all covered by the absorption wavelength of C8-SF, which illustrates that there indeed exists energy transfer from Y-MODF to C8-SF. As for the slight blue-shift of the PL peak wavelength of the C8-SF:Y-MODF blend films with the increase of Y-MODF content, it could result from the alloyed structure (as mentioned above) of the acceptor blend of C8-SF:Y-MODF showing a blue-shifted PL spectrum with the increase of Y-MODF content. Moreover, a series of OSCs were fabricated using neat Y-MODF and C8-SF and their blend films with different weight ratios. As show in Fig. 2c, all the OSCs show a very weak photovoltaic response with a low Jsc value, which indicates that there is no observable charge transfer between Y-MODF and C8-SF because of the non-cascade energy level of Y-MODF and C8-SF (the LUMO and HOMO energy levels of C8-SF are located in the bandgap between the LUMO and HOMO energy levels of Y-MODF).51,60
Photovoltaic properties
OSC devices were fabricated in the conventional architecture of glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/PDINO/Al, where ITO is indium-tin oxide, PEDOT:PSS is poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(4-styrenesulfonate), and PDINO is perylene diimide functionalized with amino N-oxide.61Fig. 3a shows the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the OSCs based on PM6:C8-SF (1:1.2, w/w), PM6:Y-MODF (1:1.2, w/w) and PM6:C8-SF:Y-MODF (1:0.9:0.3, w/w/w) blend films and the detailed photovoltaic parameters of the OSCs are listed in Table 1. With the optimized device fabrication conditions including a D/A weight ratio of 1:1.2, a total concentration of 16 mg ml−1 in chloroform solution, a spin coating speed of 3000 r/min and a thermal annealing treatment at 130 °C for 5 min, the binary device based on PM6:C8-SF yields a PCE of 11.53% with a Voc of 0.787 V, a Jsc of 20.03 mA cm−2 and a FF of 73.15%, while the PM6:Y-MODF-based binary device exhibits a lower PCE of 8.63%, with a higher Voc of 0.984 V but a lower Jsc of 12.30 mA cm−2 and a FF of 71.55%. The high FF values (over 70%) of both binary devices indicate efficient charge separation and transport in the active layer. Considering the advantages of high Voc and FF of the PM6:Y-MODF-based binary device, we fabricated ternary devices based on PM6:C8-SF with partial replacement of C8-SF by Y-MODF. When 25% of C8-SF was substituted with Y-MODF, the ternary OSCs yield a PCE of 13.39%, with an enhanced Voc of 0.845 V, a Jsc of 20.88 mA cm−2 and a FF of 75.87%. In addition, the as-cast ternary OSC without thermal treatment also shows a high PCE of 12.95%, with a high Voc of 0.876 V, a Jsc of 20.02 mA cm−2 and a FF of 73.83%, as shown in Table S2.† It is worth mentioning that all the ternary devices with the Y-MODF acceptor weight ratio changing from 8% to 58% achieved a higher PCE than the original binary ones, as shown in Table 1, which is benefitted from the higher Voc of the ternary OSCs.

Fig. 3b compares the EQE spectra of the optimal binary and ternary OSCs. All of the integrated Jsc values from EQE spectra (Table 1) agree well with the values from the J–V curves within 3% mismatch. The EQE spectra of the OSCs based on PM6:C8-SF show a high photovoltaic response (over 75%) between 600 and 750 nm but a relatively low value between 450 and 600 nm. The PM6:Y-MODF-based EQE spectra showed a narrow but high photovoltaic response between 450 and 600 nm, which is suitable for covering the shortcomings of PM6:C8-SF-based OSCs. The EQE plots of the OSCs based on PM6:C8-SF and PM6:Y-MODF with a D/A weight ratio of 1:1 and 1:1.5 were also established (shown in Fig. S6†) and the detailed photovoltaic data and the calculated Jsc are shown in Table S3.† When 25% of Y-MODF was used to replace C8-SF in the PM6:C8-SF-based binary OSCs, the EQE values between 450 and 600 nm of the ternary OSCs increased obviously, which is attributed to the enhanced Jsc of the ternary OSC. It should be noticed that the enhanced peak EQE values appear at around 600 nm which corresponds to the absorption peak of Y-MODF (see Fig. 1b), indicating the contribution from the third component of the ternary OSCs. The EQE plots of the ternary OSCs with different Y-MODF contents are shown in Fig. S7.† It appears that the photovoltaic response between 450 nm and 600 nm gradually enhanced with the increased content of Y-MODF but exhibits a maximum value in the region from 600 nm to 750 nm when 25% C8-SF was replaced by Y-MODF. These results indicate that the addition of Y-MODF could increase the Jsc of the OSC based on PM6:C8-SF though the absorption of Y-MODF is not complementary with PM6 and C8-SF.
To further investigate the charge recombination behavior, we measured the dependence of Jsc and Voc on the light intensity (Plight) for both binary and ternary OSCs, and the results are displayed in Fig. 3c and d. The α value in the formula Jsc ∝ Plightα implies the degree of bimolecular recombination; the photo-generated carriers are totally swept out and collected at the electrode if α is equal to 1.62 The α values of the binary OSCs based on PM6:C8-SF and PM6:Y-MODF were calculated to be 0.966 and 0.939, respectively, while the ternary OSC shows a slightly larger α value of 0.974, which indicates a weaker bimolecular recombination in the ternary active layer. The relationship between Voc and Plight could be described as Voc = SkT/qlnPlight, where k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the Kelvin temperature, and q is the elementary charge. The S value would be closer to 1 if the monomolecular recombination is negligible in the OSCs and vice versa.63 In our test, the S values of binary OSCs based on PM6:C8-SF and PM6:Y-MODF are 1.349 and 1.293, respectively, while the optimal ternary OSC shows an S value of 1.210, indicating a weaker monomolecular recombination in the ternary blend film. The weaker bimolecular and monomolecular recombination of the ternary OSC should be attributed to the higher Jsc and FF values over the binary OSCs. Furthermore, we measured the corresponding curves of photocurrent density (Jph) versus effective voltage (Veff) of the binary and ternary OSCs for investigating the mechanism of charge collection and exciton dissociation in the active layers.64 As shown in Fig. S8,† the Jph/Jsat is 0.9448, 0.9478 and 0.8850 for the OSCs with 0%, 25% and 100% Y-MODF contents, where Jsat is the saturated photocurrent density. Because of the positive correlation of Jph/Jsat with the charge dissociation probability (P(E,T)), this result indicates that the addition of Y-MODF in the ternary OSCs with 25% Y-MODF improved exciton dissociation and charge collection efficiency.
In addition, to understand the influence of the Y-MODF content on the hole mobilities (μh) and electron mobilities (μe) of the OSCs, we measured the charge carrier mobilities with the space charge-limited current (SCLC) method.65 The measurement results for the pure and blend films with thermal annealing at 130 °C for 5 minutes are shown in Fig. S9 and Table S4.† The μe values of pure C8-SF and Y-MODF were calculated to be 7.75 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 11.16 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 respectively and the μh value of pure PM6 was calculated to be 4.79 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. For the blend films, the μe and μh values of the PM6:C8-SF blend were calculated to be 9.58 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 5.70 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 respectively with a μe/μh ratio of 1.68. The μe and μh of the blend of PM6:Y-MODF were calculated to be 1.05 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.95 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 with a μe/μh ratio of 5.37, and the μe and μh values of the optimal PM6:C8-SF:Y-MODF blend film were calculated to be 7.84 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 5.90 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 with a μe/μh ratio of 1.33. The improved μh and the balanced μe/μh ratio should be accountable for the enhanced FF and Jsc values of the ternary OSCs.65–67
Morphological analysis
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements were carried out to understand the effect of the third component Y-MODF on the morphology of active layer. As shown in Fig. S10,† in AFM height images, the blend films based on optimal PM6:C8-SF, PM6:Y-MODF and PM6:C8-SF:Y-MODF exhibit uniform surface morphologies, and the root-mean-square (RMS) roughness values are 1.42 nm, 1.13 nm and 1.28 nm respectively. In AFM phase images, all the blend films display a well-distributed fiber texture, but the optimal ternary blend yields a more uniform domain size than the other two blend films. The TEM images (Fig. S11†) also show that the addition of Y-MODF to PM6:C8-SF leads to slightly well-distributed phase separation, which is in agreement with the morphologies from the AFM images.
Furthermore, we use grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) to investigate the molecular packing in neat and blend films, and the results are shown in Fig. 4. It can be found that the PM6 neat film showed a dominant face-on orientation, with a sharp (100) reflection (at 0.29 A−1) in the in-plane direction and π–π stacking (010) diffraction (at 1.65 A−1) in the out-of plane direction. Both C8-SF and Y-MODF neat films show a dominant face-on orientation, but the Y-MODF neat film shows stronger molecular stacking with a sharp (100) peak at 0.41 A−1, (200) peak at 0.81 A−1 and (300) peak at 1.27 A−1. The π–π stacking distances of C8-SF and Y-MODF neat films are 3.54 Å and 3.58 Å, and the crystal coherence length (CCL) is 40.43 Å and 44.22 Å, respectively, which implies that Y-MODF has a higher degree of molecular packing and self-organization than C8-SF.

For the optimal binary and ternary blend films, as shown in Fig. 4d–g, the (100) peaks of the PM6:C8-SF film at 0.29 A−1 and 0.32 A−1 in the in-plane direction came from the donor and acceptor, respectively, and the out-of-plane diffraction signals located at 1.63 A−1 and 1.78 A−1 also come from the (010) reflection of the donor and acceptor. For the PM6:Y-MODF blend film, except the (100) peaks of 0.30 A−1 and 0.41 A−1, the (200) peaks at 0.60 A−1 and 0.80 A−1 also exist in the in-plane direction, which could also be observed in the GIWAXS result of PM6 and Y-MODF neat films. When 25% of C8-SF was substituted with Y-MODF, the optimal ternary blend film shows only one (100) peak at 0.31 A−1 in the in-plane direction. The (010) peaks at 1.58 A−1 and 1.74 A−1 come from the donor and acceptor, which were identified as a unique aggregation form of the ternary blend film in comparison with the PM6:C8-SF binary blend film. The π–π stacking distance and the CCL of PM6:C8-SF are 3.86 A−1and 28.11 A−1 for the (010) donor peak and 3.53 A−1 and 34.76 A−1 for the (010) acceptor peak. In the 25% Y-MODF ternary blend film, the π–π stacking distance and the CCL of the donor changed to 3.98 A−1 and 33.08 A−1, and the π–π stacking distance and the CCL of the acceptor changed to 3.61 A−1 and 28.65 A−1. Compared with the PM6:C8-SF blend film, the increased CCL of the donor but reduced CCL of the acceptor should be accountable for the higher hole mobility and lower electron mobility of the ternary device, which causes a more balanced μe/μh ratio and thus be beneficial for the photovoltaic performance. These results indicate that the improvement of molecular packing in the ternary active layer could be responsible for the higher photovoltaic efficiencies of the ternary OSCs.
Conclusion
In conclusion, we synthesized two n-OS acceptors, C8-SF with a narrow bandgap and lower-lying ELUMO and Y-MODF with wide bandgap and higher-lying ELUMO. For the binary OSCs with PM6 as the donor, the narrow bandgap C8-SF-based device demonstrated a high Jsc of 20.03 mA cm−2 but a lower Voc of 0.787 V, while the wide bandgap Y-MODF-based OSCs showed a lower Jsc of 12.30 mA cm−2 but a higher Voc of 0.984 V, respectively, corresponding to the different bandgaps and ELUMO values of the acceptors. In order to improve the Voc of the binary OSCs based on PM6:C8-SF, Y-MODF was used as the third component and a series of ternary OSCs were fabricated. The optimal ternary OSC with 25% Y-MODF content in the acceptor achieved a high PCE of 13.39% with a higher Voc of 0.845 V. The PCE of 13.39% of the ternary OSC is significantly improved in comparison with that (11.59%) of the binary OSCs based on PM6:C8-SF, which is benefitted from the high LUMO energy level of Y-MODF. It was found that adding Y-MODF to the PM6:C8-SF binary system suppressed monomolecular recombination, increased the utilization of 450–600 nm light, and improved molecular packing and charge mobility, which could be responsible for the slightly enhanced Jsc and FF values of the ternary OSC. These results indicate that the wide bandgap acceptor with a higher LUMO energy level has potential for Voc and PCE improvement of ternary OSCs.
