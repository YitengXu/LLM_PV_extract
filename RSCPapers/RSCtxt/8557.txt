    AbstractTitanate nanotubes were synthesised using a hydrothermal method in a static and a rotating autoclave (end-over-end) over a range of rotation speeds (0–20 rpm). The control of the average length of the titanate nanotubes by the speed of rotation during their synthesis was revealed. As the rotation speed was increased, longer nanotubes (more than 1 µm at 20 rpm) were produced. This phenomenon was attributed to an increase in the mass transfer, facilitating the formation of longer intermediate titanate nanosheets. Long nanotubes self-assemble, forming secondary structures without transformation into nanowires as confirmed by the high specific surface area, pore size (inner nanotubes diameter) of 3.7 nm, XRD and Raman analyses. The initial phase of dissolution of the ends of the nanotubes was observed at higher rotation speeds. Pre-sonication treatment of the suspension of TiO2 precursor in NaOH solution resulted in a slight increase in the length of the nanotubes in the static synthesis, but did not have any effect in the rotating autoclave syntheses.
1. Introduction
Since Kasuga et al.1,2 reported the synthesis of titanate nanotubes from TiO2 by a hydrothermal method more than a decade ago, there has been a rapid development of different nanostructured materials based on titania, such as nanocrystals, nanoparticles, nanotubes, nanowires and nanofibers. The nanotubular titanates (Ti-NT) have attracted particular attention due to their unique combination of chemical and physical properties. The high surface area and open pore mesoporous structure3 along with good thermal and chemical stabilities (up to 450 °C; stable in mildly basic and in acidic conditions, although some phase transformations may occur in strong mineral acids4) and high ion-exchange capacity make titanate nanotubes an interesting material for supporting metal nanoparticle catalysts. Different metals (Pd, Au, Ru, Rh, Pt, etc) have been supported onto the nanotubes, resulting in Me/NP composites with very high (up to 10 wt%) metal loadings and narrow metal nanoparticle size distributions5,6 which have been studied in a range of catalytic reactions.7,8
Titanate nanotubes are semiconductors with a wide band gap and therefore, with potential applications in photocatalysis.9 Their magnetic properties after Co-doping,10 electric and thermal conductivities lead to potential uses in electronic devices.11 Titanate nanotubes are also being explored as mesoporous adsorbents, for example for hydrogen storage12,13 and electrochemical lithium ion storage.14 Their application in dye-synthesised solar cells is also being investigated.15
Although the nanotubes crystal structure was originally controversial, it is generally accepted that it corresponds to the multi-layered trititanates with a chemical formula H2Ti3O7.16,17 Recent theoretical calculations support this structure.18 Titanate nanotubes have been synthesised using different methods: via template synthesis,19 by alkaline hydrothermal treatment2 and electrochemically20 although nanotubes of significantly larger diameter are produced in the latter case. The hydrothermal method allows the production of titanate nanotubes on a relatively large scale with uniform morphology and high efficiency. The mechanism of formation of multiwall titanate nanotubes is still disputed, with two main mechanisms proposed: (i) rolling of titanate (100) nanosheets along the [010] direction3,16 or (ii) bending and folding of already multisheet titanate.3
Since the interest in this highly promising material is mainly due to its physico-chemical features, the ability to produce titanate nanotubes with a specific morphology is of key importance for prospective exploitation and requires an increased understanding of the influence of the synthesis conditions. Titanate nanotubes have been synthesised from a variety of TiO2 materials with a similar resulting morphology.3 However, it has been observed that there is a dependency of the nanotube average diameter on the ratio of TiO2 to NaOH and temperature during hydrothermal synthesis.3 Furthermore, different authors have studied the effects of reaction temperature and the duration of synthesis observing a transformation of the nanotubes into nanowires which takes place at progressively shorter times as the temperature increases.21,22 However, there are still some aspects of the synthesis which are not completely clear, as most previous studies lump together the effect of temperature with agitation due to convective motion caused by spatial temperature distribution along the autoclave.
In this article we report the effect of careful control of the autoclave temperature and enhanced mass transfer during the hydrothermal synthesis attained via the autoclave end-over-end rotation, on the morphology of the produced nanotubes, with the aim of obtaining high aspect ratio nanotubes. This represents the first attempt to experimentally deconvolute the effects of temperature (kinetics) and mass transfer on the synthesis of titanate nanotubes, providing new mechanistic insights, complementing the available experimental data in the open literature. A range of characterization techniques was used to verify the presence of nanotubes and the absence of nanowires in the samples. We show that length control can be achieved by adjusting the end-over-end rotation speed during the hydrothermal synthesis under careful temperature control of the synthesis.
2. Experimental
Titanate nanotubes were synthesised by a hydrothermal method described in detail in ref. 3. In a typical preparation, 2 g of titanium dioxide (anatase, Sigma Aldrich) were added to 30 mL of 10 M NaOH solution and mixed in a 45 mL PTFE beaker. The solution was placed in a Teflon lined autoclave at 130 °C for 20 hours. The autoclave can be rotated end-over-end by a specially constructed drive mechanism inside an air-circulating oven, which keeps the temperature homogeneous inside the autoclave. Synthesis was carried out at different rotation speeds of 2, 6 and 20 rpm, as well as in static conditions. Following hydrothermal synthesis, the autoclave was allowed to cool to ambient temperature. The white powder of titanate nanotubes obtained was filtered, washed several times with deionised water and dried at 120 °C overnight. Large particles of agglomerated dry powder were broken in a mortar prior to further investigation. The powder was washed again repeatedly with water and 0.1 M H2SO4 solution until the pH was around 7 in order to exchange the surface Na+ by H+. Residual Na+ always remains in the titanate nanotubes and is detectable by Raman spectroscopy. Another set of samples was prepared by sonicating the TiO2–NaOH starting mixture slurry prior to hydrothermal synthesis, all other conditions and preparation steps were identical. Conversion into titanate nanotubes was close to 100% and no amorphous phase was found in any of the syntheses.
The phase identification of the samples was done by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses using an X'Pert PRO diffractometer by PANalytical with a Cu Kα radiation, operated at 40 kV and 40 mA. Raman spectra were recorded by a LabRAM-HR instrument (Horiba Jobin Yvon) using 532 nm laser, with spectral resolution of 1 cm−1. Low temperature nitrogen adsorption measurements were done using a Micromeritics Tri Star 3000 instrument. Specific surface area was calculated by the BET method and pore size distributions were calculated from the desorption data using the BJH model. He-pycnometry technique was used to determine average pore volume and density using a Micromeritics GeoPyc 1360 model. A JEOL 2010 microscope was used for electron transmission images.
The nomenclature of the nanostructures in this article is as commonly used in the literature,23 where nanotubes are defined as structure with a high-aspect-ratio with a hollow inner channel and diameters less than 20 nm. On the other hand, nanowires also have a high-aspect-ratio but without an inner void and have diameters less than 100 nm.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Synthesis of nanotubes in static conditions: effect of pre-sonication treatment
A typical titanate nanotubes structure obtained by hydrothermal method in static conditions consists of several concentric layers (typically four) with an inner diameter between 5 and 10 nanometres,24,25 a distance between layers of 0.72 nm23 and an average length between 200 and 400 nm.25 TEM images (Fig. 1a) reveal an average length of around 50–150 nm with a random orientation. The images clearly show the open structure of the nanotubes, with the darker contrast of multi-layered walls in the objects oriented parallel with the image plane and open end-tubes clearly visible in two objects oriented perpendicular to the imaging plane.
 Fig. 1  TEM images of titanate nanotubes synthesised under static conditions: (a) without and (b) with pre-sonication treatment of precursor mixture. 
Another synthesis was carried out under the same static hydrothermal conditions but pre-sonicating the TiO2–NaOH solution before the synthesis. Fig. 1b shows that their length increases slightly (∼200 nm) if the precursor material is previously sonicated without apparent effect on the diameter or the number of layers. This effect has already been reported in the literature25–27 where the authors concluded that the sonication treatment promotes the breaking of the Ti–O–Ti bonds in the precursor material and favours the intercalation of Na+ into the titania lattice.
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of titanate nanotubes synthesised under static conditions with and without pre-sonication treatment are identical, showing reflections at 10°, 24.6°, 28.8° and 48.6° 2θ. These correspond well with the reflections of trititanate (H2Ti3O7), which is believed to be the most likely structure of the nanotubes.17,23,28
Further characterisation of these samples is discussed below in comparison with the samples synthesised under rotation.
3.2 Effect of rotation on the nanotubes synthesis
Characterization of different titanate nanotubes was carried out in order to compare materials synthesised in an end-over-end rotating autoclave and under static conditions. Several batches of titanate nanotubes were also synthesised in a similar way under different rotating speeds but pre-sonicating the TiO2 precursor material in the NaOH solution for 30 minutes with a sonication power of 35 W.
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the nanotubes synthesised under rotation and static conditions are shown in Fig. 2. In all cases and independently of the speed of rotation, there is no apparent difference from the pattern of the trititanate material.23 The formation of nanowires or nanoribbons would show an XRD pattern with sharper peaks at 25 and 31° 2θ and the presence of new peaks at 35° 2θ,24 not observed in any of the present samples. The XRD spectra of titanate nanotubes synthesised with and without pre-sonication treatment are also identical, suggesting that under all these synthesis conditions only nanotubes materials are formed without the presence of nanowires.

Raman spectra of the titanate nanotubes synthesised at different rotation speeds are shown in Fig. 3. The TiO2 starting material (not shown) is characterised by well-defined peaks at 142, 196, 397, 514 and 639 cm−1 which correspond to the anatase structure.17 No anatase bands are observed in any of the samples, confirming full conversion of the starting material. The characteristic bands typically assigned to nanotubes are at 145, 195, 280, 450, 640, 700 and 920 cm−1.29 However, in the case of these samples bands at 161 and 190 cm−1 and a broad small band at 850 cm−1 were observed. The bands around 900 and 850 are assigned to Ti–O–Na and Ti–O–H symmetrical stretching modes with very short Ti–O distance in titanate structures.30 The presence of 905–920 cm−1 band suggests incomplete ion exchange of Na, which is typical in the nanotube synthesis.
 Fig. 3  Raman spectra of titanate nanotubes synthesised under different rotation speeds. 
The samples obtained under different agitation conditions show clear differences in the Raman spectra between 670 and 702 cm−1, see Fig. 3b. The bands between 500 and 700 cm−1 are assigned to octahedral distortion in TiO6, the stronger the band the larger is the distortion, resulting in a higher intensity and a shift in position of the band associated with the Ti–O distance.30 Two bands are present in all samples at 670 and 702 cm−1, see Fig. 3b, similar to earlier reported Raman spectra of nanotubes.31 The relative magnitude of both bands seems to be related to the rotation speed during the synthesis although no clear trend was observed. The band at 704 cm−1 was reported to be due to second order phonon mode of rutile due to lattice distortion, a similar interpretation of the origin of the band in this region is given in ref. 30. The presence of two bands suggests a mixed phase with two different TiO6 octahedra distortions. A more detailed investigation of the crystal structure of titanates and the association of Raman bands is required. It is interesting that the band at 702 cm−1 nearly totally disappeared in the sample prepared from the pre-sonicated reaction slurry under stirring conditions. This sample also shows fewer number of bands in the overview spectra, see Fig. 3a, notably the absence of bands at 385 and 850 cm−1, also suggesting a cleaner sample, possibly with only one lattice being pre-dominant.
Nitrogen adsorption analyses show a typical type IV adsorption isotherm (Fig. 4) in all samples synthesised under different rotation speeds, which confirms the presence of mesopores. Based on TEM results the internal tube diameter in the titanate nanotubes is ca. 4 nm.3 This corresponds well to the apparent maximum in the differential pore volume distribution calculated by the BJH method. However, since this area of the isotherm falls onto nitrogen's phase change at P/P0 = 0.42, the sorption data cannot be reliably assigned to the pore diameter of 3–4 nm. The nitrogen adsorption isotherm of the sample synthesised under a rotation speed of 20 rpm (Fig. 4b) exhibits a slightly different shape hysteresis to that of the sample synthesised under static conditions: the desorption branch in the hysteresis is more horizontal and it has a steeper end of the hysteresis at P/P0 = 0.45–0.50. In both cases, the adsorption isotherms seem to be composites of cylindrical open pores of the titanate nanotubes, sheets and a contribution of the packing structure of the nanotubes in the dry bulk sample, either with a random orientation or forming secondary structures. Nevertheless, these isotherms do not show any evidence of narrowing of the nanotubes.

He-pycnometry technique was used to calculate the average pore volume and density (Table 1) of the different samples. Similar results were obtained in all the samples regardless of the rotation rate or pre-sonicating treatment, which suggest the absence of nanowires in the samples. The surface area determined by BET method (Table 1) oscillates between 140 and 230 m2 g−1. All values are within the typical range for this material.23 These variations are not related to the rotation speeds, as the highest surface area was obtained at 6 rpm and the lowest at 20 rpm. These high surface area values are another indication of the nanotubes morphology and the absence of nanowires, characterized by much lower surface areas (∼50 m2 g−1).32

Fig. 5 shows TEM images of the titanate nanotubes synthesised under rotation at 2, 6 and 20 rpm respectively. Due to the three-dimensional nature of the samples, these images are intentionally de-focussed in regions in order to enhance contrast in determined areas and reveal the morphology. The titanate nanotubes synthesised in a static autoclave have average lengths around 50–150 nm with an apparently random orientation in the TEM preparations. Even a low rotation speed of 2 rpm (Fig. 5a) has a clear influence on the nanotubes morphology, with lengths above 450 nm and a more parallel orientation of the tubes clearly observed. A higher rotation speed of 6 rpm (Fig. 5b) not only results in an increase in the average length of the nanotubes (∼650 nm) but also secondary structures begin to appear: nanotubes appear to be aligned into parallel long tightly packed strings (Fig. 5b). Nevertheless, it is possible to observe the hollow-structure of the nanotubes on the edges of the agglomerations and in the individual nanotubes in the images.
 Fig. 5  TEM images of titanate nanotubes synthesised under different rotation speeds: (a) 2 rpm, (b) 6 rpm and (c–d) 20 rpm. 
At the rotation speed of 20 rpm, the length of nanotubes was found to be over 1000 nm. In this case, the agglomeration of nanotubes into secondary linear structures with the diameter of ∼50 nm is more pronounced than in the sample synthesised at 6 rpm. Fig. 5d shows a more detailed view of the ends of these linear structures where it is possible to distinguish the heterogeneity caused by different parallel-oriented nanotubes. It is difficult to observe the hollow-structure of all the individual nanotubes due to reduced contrast in the image of tightly packed nanotubes.
The phenomenon of titanate nanotubes agglomeration has been reported previously,3 showing formation of spherical assemblies with diameters between 1 and 10 µm, depending significantly on the ratio TiO2/NaOH during the hydrothermal synthesis. Unfortunately, there were no further studies exploring the reasons behind such agglomerations. Similar tubular agglomerations to these shown in this article were observed by Horváth et al.32 as an intermediate step in the conversion of titanate nanotubes into nanowires in a revolving autoclave (rotating around either the long or the short axis at 60 rpm—three times faster than the maximum rotation speed used in this study). They observed that the nanotubes self-assembled into hierarchical secondary structures before being converted into long (∼5 µm), dense and compact nanowires with a very low surface area (<50 m2 g−1) and different XRD patterns to that of titanate nanotubes. At the low rotation speeds used in this study, only nanotubes were obtained even after 48 h of hydrothermal treatment with no microscopical or XRD evidence of a significant fraction of nanowires being formed. Nevertheless, it is possible that the ends of the nanotubes are beginning to dissolve and the low molecular weight titanate species are being transported into the inner space, as suggested by the change in the hysteresis observed in the corresponding nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherm, Fig. 4b.
Sonication of the nanotubes sample synthesised with agitation at 20 rpm rotation of the autoclave results in breaking up of the agglomerates and shortening of nanotubes, yielding a similar sample morphology to that obtained under static conditions, see Fig. 6. This also confirms that our samples consist almost exclusively of nanotubes.
 Fig. 6  TEM images of titanate nanotubes synthesised in a rotating autoclave at 20 rpm and sonicated after synthesis. 
Sonication treatment is a general practice to disperse the sample before being analysed by TEM. However, in this case, it would break the agglomerations and secondary structures of the nanotubes and also reduce their length, as it has previously been shown and reported.3 This might be the reason why these secondary structures of the nanotubes are not frequently reported in the literature.

Fig. 7 shows TEM images of the samples at several rotation speeds using pre-sonicated TiO2 precursor. It was shown previously that under static conditions, pre-sonication slightly increased the length of the nanotubes compared with the ones synthesised from the non-sonicated precursor suspension.27 However, no differences in the length and hollow-morphology of the nanotubes synthesised with and without pre-sonication treatment were observed when the synthesis was done under rotating conditions. Rotation of the autoclave during the synthesis favours mixing of the precursor TiO2 slurry in the NaOH solution with similar effects to a pre-sonication treatment. Viriya-empikul et al.27 claimed that pre-sonication treatment favours the formation of longer nanosheets due to the generation of a suspension of the TiO2 precursor. However, pre-sonication cannot avoid the precursor precipitation during the 20 hours of hydrothermal synthesis. On the other hand, when the synthesis is carried out under gentle rotation, better and more reproducible mass transfer conditions are achieved during the whole synthesis duration, producing longer titanate nanotubes independently of whether a pre-sonication treatment was applied.

3.3 Mechanistic understanding of the effect of agitation
Rotating the autoclave creates a flow pattern in the reaction medium which appears to be responsible for the parallel orientation of the nanotubes and their self-assembly. The tendency of nanotubes to form secondary structures was already observed previously, but under static conditions, where spherical aggregates were obtained in highly diluted synthesis solutions i.e. at high ratio of NaOH:TiO2.3 However, rotation increases convective mass transfer inside the autoclave, which might be responsible for the increase in the average length of the titanate nanotubes by an order of magnitude.33 There are different reasons which can explain this effect according to previously proposed mechanisms.
(i) The most accepted mechanisms for the formation of titanate nanotubes consist of the wrapping of titanate nanosheets to form nanotubes34 and folding of titanate multisheets.3 Wu et al.22 proposed that the precursor TiO2 material is dissolved into the NaOH solution followed by nucleation and growth into lamellar structures. In a traditional static synthesis, the overall rate of formation of nanotubes is controlled by the rate of diffusion.27 According to these mechanisms, longer nanotubes can only be formed by longer nanosheets. The formation of longer nanosheets is favoured by an increased mass transport in the rotating device. Lamellar structures grow faster along the [001] and [010] directions than along the [100] direction,22 which justify that the final increment in the number of layers is not proportional to the increment in length. An increase in the average nanotubes diameter was also observed at longer synthesis times21,22 or when the temperature was increased.3,24,27
The transformation of titanate nanotubes into nanowires is believed to happen due to the dissolution of the ends of the tubes, transport into the inner channel and recrystallization.32 Yoshida et al.35 were able to synthesise nanowires at 150 °C, which is by 20 °C lower from the temperature generally accepted for the synthesis of nanowires24 due to the improved mass-transfer achieved through stirring. The low speed of rotation applied in this work, allows a higher mass transfer compared to the static case producing longer nanotubes, and at the same time it is not high enough to favour the transformation into nanowires at 130 °C. Further investigation is required to quantify the effect of mass transfer on the synthesis rates, preferably involving in situ XRD and/or Raman measurements.
(ii) On the other hand, the results could also be explained by the less accepted crystal growth mechanism for the formation of nanotubes. According to this theory, a small proportion of titania precursor dissolves in the NaOH solution and recrystallizes into nanosheets that curve to form nano-loops. The rest of the material is transformed into nanotubes by oriented crystal growth.33 In this case, the higher mass-transfer produced by the rotation would favour the formation of longer nanotubes by supplying building blocks to the initial seed for an oriented crystal growth.
4. Conclusions
An autoclave with the end-over-end rotation was used for the synthesis of titanate nanotubes. It was observed that an increase in the rotation speed up to 20 rpm is translated into much longer nanotubes (more than 1000 nm) than under static synthesis conditions. At the same time, nanotubes self-assemble into linear secondary structures as an autoclave rotation speed was increased. Formation of nanowires was not observed in any of the samples, as proven by the high surface area (∼200 m2 g−1), correct pore size (3.7 nm), high pore volume (0.97 cm3 g−1) of all the samples as well as by results of HRTEM, XRD and Raman analyses.
