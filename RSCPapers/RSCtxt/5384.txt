    , Accepted 4th December 2015First published on 7th December 2015AbstractThree fluorene-based alcohol-soluble organic small molecule electrolytes (SMEs) with different conjugated backbones, namely, TFTN-Br, FTFN-Br and FTTFN-Br, were designed as cathode interfacial layers for inverted polymer solar cells (i-PSCs). The insertion of SMEs to the ITO/active layer interfaces effectively lowered the energy barrier for electron transport and improved the inherent compatibility between the hydrophilic ITO and hydrophobic active layers. Due to these advantages, the device based on poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT):(6,6)-phenyl-C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) with TFTN-Br as the cathode interfacial layer achieved an improved power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.8%, which is a 26% improvement when compared to the standard device comprising ZnO cathode interfacial layers (PCE = 3.0%). Devices with FTFN-Br and FTTFN-Br also showed an improved PCE of 3.1% and 3.5%, respectively. The variation in device performance enhancement was found to be primarily correlated with the different conformation of their assembly onto the electrode caused by the joint sequence of the polar group of the SMEs, consequently impacting the dipole moment and interface morphology. In addition, introducing SMEs as the cathode interfacial layer also produced devices with long-term stability.
Introduction
Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs) blending of conjugated polymers and fullerene acceptors have attracted considerable attention for their potential advantages such as low cost, mechanical flexibility, lightweight and ease of fabrication for large-area production.1–3 Recently, single-junction PSCs have already broken the power conversion efficiency (PCE) record of 10%.4,5 Usually, there are two main device configurations: the conventional and the inverted structures. In addition, it has been realized that the inverted device structure is superior over the conventional device structure.6–9 On account of the acid poly(3,4-ethyl-enedioxythiophene):(polystyrene sulfonic acid) (PEDOT:PSS) anode and the easily oxidized low work function cathode metals in conventional devices,10,11 the inverted devices have shown much better device stability using metal oxides (ZnO or TiOx) as the bottom cathode and employing high work function metals (Cu or Ag) as the top anode. Furthermore, the inverted structure efficiently uses the vertical composition gradient in the active layer, with a fullerene-rich phase approach in the cathode and a polymer-rich phase approach in the anode.12–15 The key issue in inverted PSCs is the development of interfacial materials to tune the energy alignment and improve the contact interface between the photoactive layer and the ITO cathode,16,17 which can promote charge selective transport and collection.
Currently, a variety of electron-transporting layer (ETL) materials have been applied in inverted PSCs, including inorganic metal oxides (such as Cs2CO3, TiOx and ZnO) and organic materials (such as PFN and PEIE).18–23 The inorganic interfacial materials can give rise to decent device performance,24 however, the compatible processing temperature of the metal oxides with temperature sensitive substrates for organic electronics is a perplexed issue for researchers.25 Moreover, these inorganic materials have poor interfacial contact with the organic active layer. Thus, organic materials are often incorporated as an interfacial layer to modulate or replace inorganic materials. These organic interlayers, including conjugated polymer electrolytes (CPEs) and small molecule electrolytes (SMEs), have drawn more and more attention for their excellent modification of the electrode. When compared to CPEs, the SMEs are easily purified, have high monodispersity, well-defined structures and better batch-to-batch reproducibility. Although SMEs have rendered the device with notable efficiency,26 the exploration of SMEs interlayers for PSCs is still rare and lag much behind the CPEs interlayers.
Taking the advantages of SMEs into account, in this study, three fluorene-based alcohol-soluble small molecular electrolytes (SMEs) with different conjugated backbones, 6-(2,7-bis(5-octylthiophen-2-yl)-9-(6-(trimethylammonio)hexyl)-9H-fluoren-9-yl)-N,N,N-trimethylhexan-1-aminium bromide (TFTN-Br), 6-(2-(5-(9,9-bis(6-(trimethylammonio)hexyl)-9H-fluoren-2-yl)thiophen-2-yl)-9-(6-(trimethylammonio)hexyl)-9H-fluoren-9-yl)-N,N,N-trimethylhexan-1-aminium bromide (FTFN-Br) and 6-(2-(5-(5-(9,9-bis(6-(trimethylammonio)hexyl)-9H-fluoren-2-yl)thiophn-2-yl)thiophen-2-yl)-9-(6-(trimethylammonio)hexyl)-9H-fluoren-9-yl)-N,N,N-trimethylhexan-1-aminium bromide (FTTFN-Br), bearing amine groups on their side chains were designed and synthesized. These SMEs are highly soluble in methanol (MeOH), dimethyl formamide (DMF), dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and other polar solvents. However, they show poor solubility in non-polar solvents such as chlorobenzene (Fig. S1 in ESI†), which can avoid the erosion from the upper organic active layer in inverted polymer solar cells (i-PSCs)27 and can also favor an environmentally friendly process. It can be found that the conjugated backbone of the SMEs greatly influences the conformation of their assembly onto the electrode and consequently, impacts the dipole moment and interface morphology. When compared to FTFN-Br and FTTFN-Br, TFTN-Br can provide a more compatible contact between ITO and the active layer, improve charge mobility and achieve a better energy alignment in the device. The device based on poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT):(6,6)-phenyl-C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) with TFTN-Br as the ETL achieves an improved power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.8%, which is a 26% improvement when compared to the standard device comprising an ZnO ETL (PCE = 3.0%). Devices with FTFN-Br and FTTFN-Br ETL also showed an improved PCE of 3.1% and 3.5%, respectively.

Device fabrication
Polymeric solar cells were fabricated based on poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT):(6,6)-phenyl-C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) with ZnO or SMEs as the electron transport layer (ETL). All devices were fabricated on pre-treated ITO glass substrates, cleaned sequentially using sonication in acetone, detergent, deionized water, isopropanol and then dried under a stream of nitrogen, followed by ultraviolet light irradiation. The ZnO precursor solution was prepared according to a literature procedure.19 The methanol solution of SMEs with a concentration of 0.5 mg mL−1 was then spin coated at 3000 rpm for 30 s onto the ITO substrate. Thereafter, the active layer of P3HT:PC61BM (1:0.8 w/w) in 1,2-dichlorobenzene was spin coated, followed by thermal annealing at 150 °C for 10 minutes in a glovebox. Eventually, the double-layered structure of molybdenum trioxide (MoO3) (7 nm)/argentum (Ag) (90 nm) was deposited over the active layer by thermal evaporation under a vacuum of 6 × 10−4 Torr to accomplish the device fabrication. The effective area of one cell was 0.04 cm2. J–V curves were measured using a Keithley 2400 source meter (100 mW cm−2, AM 1.5 G, Abet Solar Simulator Sun2000). IPCE spectra were obtained on an IPCE measuring system (Oriel Cornerstone 260 1/4 m monochromator equipped with an Oriel 70613NS QTH lamp). All the measurements were performed at room temperature under an ambient atmosphere.
Results and discussion
The synthetic routes used to prepare the three SMEs are shown in Scheme 1. TFTN-Br, FTFN-Br and FTTFN-Br possess similar structures, including a conjugated backbone and quaternary ammonium ions (–N(CH3)3+). All of them were synthesized using a Pd(PPh3)4-catalyzed Stille coupling reaction. The quantitative quaternization is above 99% based on the disappearance of the signal of CH2–Br in the 1H-NMR spectra at δ = 3.26. The fluorene units are linked by thiophene and bithiophene in FTFN-Br and FTTFN-Br, respectively. However, two 5-octylthiophen units are connected to the 2,7-position of fluorene unit in TFTN-Br. Due to the polar quaternary ammonium ions (–N(CH3)3+), all the SMEs have good solubility in polar solvents such as MeOH, DMSO and DMF.
 Scheme 1  The synthetic routes used to prepare FTFN-Br, FTTFN-Br and TFTN-Br. 
The normalized ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra of TFTN-Br, FTFN-Br and FTTFN-Br in MeOH solution and their solid films on quartz substrates are shown in Fig. S2, and the relevant data listed in Table S1 (ESI†). In solution, the absorption maximum (λabs) for TFTN-Br, FTFN-Br and FTTFN-Br is located at 361 nm, 378 nm and 403 nm, respectively. When compared to their corresponding solutions, the films of the SMEs also showed red-shifted λabs, indicating strong intermolecular stacking in the solid state.28 In addition, the λabs both in solutions and films are red-shifted, due to the more ordered packing arrangement in the solid states. From the optical transmittance spectra of the SMEs coated on ITO (Fig. S3, ESI†), due to the ultrathin thickness film of the SMEs,22 the ITO/SMEs substrates display a good transmittance (approximately the same as bare ITO) in the visible light region. Therefore, the light-harvesting of the active layer would not be affected by the SMEs, and TFTN-Br, FTFN-Br and FTTFN-Br can be employed as an electron transporting layer for inverted PSCs.
The energy levels of the SMEs were measured using cyclic voltammetry (CV), as presented in Fig. S4 (ESI†). The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) values and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) values of the SMEs are obtained from the onsets of the oxidation potential (Eonset/ox) and reduction potential (Eonset/red), respectively.29 The HOMO/LUMO values for TFTN-Br, FTFN-Br and FTTFN-Br are estimated to be −5.16/−2.60 eV, −5.34/−2.83 eV and −5.20/−3.00 eV, respectively. Correspondingly, the electrochemical band gaps (Ecvg) for TFTN-Br, FTFN-Br and FTTFN-Br are 2.56, 2.51 and 2.20 eV, respectively, which are consistent with the optical band gaps (Eoptg) listed in Table S1 (ESI†).
Density functional theory (DFT) computation was performed to give a preliminary insight into the geometric structures and dipolar properties of the three SMEs using the DFT B3LYP/6-31G(d) level of theory with the Gaussian 09 suite of programs.30 As shown in Fig. 1, resulting from the electrostatic repulsion and steric hindrance, the two polar groups situated on the opposite side of the two fluorine unit backbone in FTFN-Br and FTTFN-Br subsequently lead to a low dipole moment. The different thiophene (T) bridge in FTFN-Br and FTTFN-Br caused a diverse dipole (11.4 D in FTFN-Br and 9.4 D in FTTFN-Br). Distinguishingly, the TFTN-Br has only one polar group in the backbone, whereby acquiring much stronger dipole moment (28.7 D). The dipole moment in TFTN-Br is also stronger than that found in FFN-Br (10.6 D), wherein the structure is similar to the well-known PFN-Br (Fig. S5, ESI†). In addition, the structural variation also caused a distinctly different dihedral angle between the T unit and flanked benzene in the fluorine unit of the SMEs. In contrast to only one thiophene bridge in FTFN-Br (the dihedral angles are 31.4° and −26.6°), the two thiophene bridge make the backbone of FTTFN-Br more flexible and increases the distance between the two polar groups, which weaken the repulsion to a certain degree to obtain smaller dihedral angles of −19.0°, 17.4° and −19.1°. Due to the absence of electrostatic repulsion from the opposite side of the polar group, the dihedral angles in TFTN-Br were reduced to 24.3° and 23.4°. The various dipole moments found in the SMEs would profoundly influence the interfacial properties and their structural geometry would impact the interfacial morphology as well.31
 Fig. 1  The calculated results of the geometric structures and dipolar properties of the SMEs. 
The work function of ITO modified with TFTN-Br, FTFN-Br and FTTFN-Br was investigated using ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS). Herein, ZnO (sol–gel ZnO nanoparticles deposited on an ITO substrate) was also presented for comparison.19 The high binding energy cut offs (Ecutoff) of the SMEs and ZnO coated on ITO are shown in Fig. 2a. The work function of bare ITO substrate is estimated to be 4.77 eV. Although an ultrathin interlayer is spin coated onto the ITO, the Ecutoff for the ITO/SMEs has an obvious shift to higher energy. The shift of Evac indicated that interfacial dipoles formed at the ITO/SMEs interfaces, which was equivalent to subtracting the work function of ITO from the difference between the Evac of the SMEs film and the Fermi energy of ITO.32,33 Thus, the work function of ITO could be reduced by 0.35, 0.51, 0.74 and 0.89 eV with the introduction of ZnO, FTFN-Br, FTTFN-Br and TFTN-Br, respectively. The reduced work function would bring about an improved energy alignment and electron extraction and collection.34,35 The energy level diagram of the photovoltaic cells is shown in Fig. 2b. The variation of the work function of the ITO after being coated by FTFN-Br and FTTFN-Br is not as identical as our prediction obtained from the DFT computations without consideration on the conformation of the SMEs on the ITO.

High-resolution X-ray photoelectron spectra of (c) In 3d and (d) O 1s on the surface of SMEs coated on the ITO substrate. 
To probe the reason for the variation of the work function of ITO modified by TFTN-Br, FTFN-Br and FTTFN-Br, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out to investigate the surface properties of ITO, ITO/ZnO and the ITO/SMEs. For the pure ITO, the In 3d XPS spectrum shown in Fig. 2c has two peaks centered at 452.52 eV and 444.94 eV. Obviously, the In 3d peaks for ITO/ZnO, ITO/FTFN-Br, ITO/FTTFN-Br and ITO/TFTN-Br were shifted towards the lower binding energy by 0.51, 0.56, 0.73 and 0.80 eV, respectively, indicating the strong interaction between the SMEs and the ITO. A similar shift tendency is observed in the O 1s XPS spectra of ITO modified by ZnO and the SMEs (Fig. 2d). The shifts in the peaks of the binding energies revealed the following: (i) interactions between the polar groups in the SMEs and the ITO surface existed and (ii) the backbone of the SMEs influenced the chemical shifts.36 From the shifts in the peaks of binding energies we can see that, ITO/TFTN-Br interface has the strongest interactions, whereas ITO/FTFN-Br has the lowest, which is in accordance with the change in their work functions.
To characterize the effect of the SMEs on the surface of ITO, water contact angles were measured for bare ITO and for ITO modified with the SMEs. The contact angles for bare ITO, TFTN-Br, FTFN-Br and FTFN-Br were 49°, 74°, 45° and 58°, respectively (Fig. S6, ESI†). The contact angle of ITO modified with TFTN-Br was the largest, implying a more hydrophobic surface with the conjugated backbone exposed to air. It is suspected that more hydrophobic backbones of the FTFN-Br and FTTFN-Br faced upward to the surface.
To gain further insight into the surface of the SMEs on ITO, a preferential interaction of SMEs onto ITO is proposed on the basis of the changes in the XPS data, work function and water contact angles, which is shown in Fig. 3. Due to the spontaneous orientation of the SMEs, the ionic side chains tend to move towards the hydrophilic ITO, whereas the hydrophobic aromatic backbone preferentially faced upward to the surface.36–39 For the TFTN-Br interlayer, all the ionic side chains oriented towards the ITO substrate, thereby developing the strongest interaction between ITO and TFTN-Br. However, according to the DFT computations, the ionic side chains of fluorene are located on both sides of the FTFN-Br and FTTFN-Br backbone, which would hinder their assembly onto the ITO substrate. Therefore, both FTFN-Br and FTTFN-Br have relatively weaker interactions with the ITO versusTFTN-Br. Moreover, in order to ensure most of the ionic side chains anchor onto the ITO substrate, the backbones of FTFN-Br and FTTFN-Br are grabbed by the ionic side chains towards the ITO and have to adopt a flat plane (just like face-on conformation), which is quite different from TFTN-Br presenting vertical plane on ITO. The difference in the conformation subsequently altered the dipole moments. As a result, the TFTN-Br interlayer created a much stronger dipole moment (μD) at the interface than FTFN-Br and FTTFN-Br, as shown in Fig. 3. The strong and favorable dipole moment (μD) in TFTN-Br/ITO is correlated with the remarkable reduction in the work function, which can lower the Schottky barrier and achieve a better energy alignment to facilitate the electron collection and transport from the active layer to the ITO. When compared with FTFN-Br bearing one thiophene bridge, FTTFN-Br with a two thiophene bridge was more flexible, which is helpful for the ionic side chains to orientate towards the ITO and for the backbone facing upward to the surface. The hydrophobic backbone aggregated on the surface can be confirmed by the larger water contact angle of FTTFN-Br than that of FTFN-Br. Hence, FTTFN-Br has the slightly stronger effect on ITO than FTFN-Br, which probably is the reason why the work functions of FTFN-Br and FTTFN-Br are different from those predicted during the DFT computations.

To evaluate the surface properties and morphology of TFTN-Br, FTFN-Br and FTTFN-Br, SMEs deposited on ITO were measured by atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Fig. 4a–d). The standard ZnO surface was relatively smooth with a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 3.03 nm (Fig. 4a) and the RMS roughness for FTTFN-Br (Fig. 4c) and FTFN-Br (Fig. 4d) are 3.04 nm and 4.67 nm, respectively. There is no obvious difference between FTFN-Br and FTTFN-Br in terms of the surface RMS roughness for the similar conjugated backbones. However, due to the stronger interaction between TFTN-Br and ITO, TFTN-Br showed a rougher surface with a RMS roughness of 7.25 nm (Fig. 4b).

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the P3HT:PC61BM films on top of the (i) ZnO, (j) TFTN-Br, (k) FTTFN-Br and (l) FTFN-Br layer. 
The effect of the SMEs interfacial layer on the morphology of the bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) active layer was also investigated. Although the interlayer is a thin film, the interlayer has an obvious influence on the morphology of the active layer.40,41 The related AFM height images are shown in Fig. 4e–h. The surface RMS roughness of P3HT:PC61BM coated on the FTTFN-Br and FTFN-Br (Fig. 4g and h) substrate is 4.96 nm and 5.49 nm, respectively. However, when using TFTN-Br as the ETL, the active layer exhibits the highest RMS roughness of 6.82 nm (Fig. 4f), which is primarily caused by the larger RMS roughness (7.25 nm) of the TFTN-Br substrate. Moreover, the morphology change of the active layer on the different SMEs surface caused by the different interlayers was further verified by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), as shown in Fig. 4i–l. The TEM images of the P3HT:PC61BM film on FTFN-Br, FTTFN-Br and ZnO are similar. In comparison to the P3HT:PC61BM film deposited on FTFN-Br and FTTFN-Br, the blend film deposited on TFTN-Br achieved a more homogeneous morphology with a P3HT-rich phase and PCBM-rich phase with a small phase separation size,42 which can facilitate the charge separation.
To investigate the influence of the backbones of the SMEs on device performance, the inverted PSCs based on the SMEs were fabricated with a device architecture composed of ITO/SMEs/P3HT:PC61BM/MoO3/Ag. The SMEs were deposited on ITO as a cathode interface modification layer. Fig. 5a shows the J–V curves for the devices based on P3HT:PC61BM BHJ, which were measured under AM 1.5 G solar irradiation. The device performance parameters are summarized in Table 1. All the SMEs interlayers were optimized with an ultrathin thickness using an optimized concentration (0.5 mg mL−1) of their methanol solutions and the same spin-coating speed. From Fig. 5 and Table 1, we can see that all of the devices with SMEs ETLs showed significantly improved PCE than the control device composed of ITO/MeOH (0.85%).43 The PCE of the devices with SMEs is even comparable to that of the standard device composed of a ZnO ETL (PCE = 3.0%), revealing that TFTN-Br, FTFN-Br and FTTFN-Br are effective materials for cathode interfacial modification. In particular, the PCE of the TFTN-Br based device achieved the highest PCE of 3.8%, with a Voc of 0.616 V, a Jsc of 9.93 mA cm−2 and a FF of 62.1%, giving a 26% enhancement over the control device composed of ZnO as the cathode interlayer. However, devices with FTFN-Br and FTTFN-Br ETL show relatively lower PCEs of 3.1% and 3.5%, respectively. The overall enhanced parameters (PCE, Voc, Jsc and FF) of the SMEs-based devices are related to the achievement of better energy alignment and more compatible contact between each layer.28

Fig. 5b reveals the J–V characteristics of the i-PSCs measured in the dark. In the range from −2 to 2 V, the dark current densities for the device with the SMEs are remarkably suppressed. There is an approximately 7× dark current density reduction upon the insertion of TFTN-Br. Therefore, the high photocurrent should also be associated with the suppressed charge recombination induced by the enhanced interfacial contact at the SMEs/active layer interface.44,45
The influence of the SMEs on electron extraction was revealed by electron-only device measurements based on the P3HT:PC61BM blends using a structure composed of ITO/ETLs/P3HT:PC61BM/LiF/Al. The J–V characteristics were measured by the space charge limited current model (SCLC) according to the Mott–Gurney equation (details in the ESI†).46–49 As shown in Fig. 5c, the ZnO/P3HT:PC61BM film achieves an apparent electron mobility of 4.66 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. By the incorporation of these SMEs as the cathode buffer layer, the apparent electron mobility gradually increased to 8.95 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for FTFN-Br, 1.29 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 for FTTFN-Br and 1.41 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 for TFTN-Br. The improved electron mobility contributed to the increased Jsc and FF.
The incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) values also agreed with the improved efficiency of the devices based on SMEs (Fig. 5d). Obviously, with respect to the devices composed of FTFN-Br and ZnO, the TFTN-Br and FTTFN-Br based devices demonstrate significantly higher IPCE values in the wavelength range from 520–700 nm, in accordance with their higher Jsc values.
To research the influence of the SMEs on the device stability, the air stability of the unencapsulated i-PSCs with SMEs interlayers was periodically tested for 50 days (humidity, ∼55%, ∼25 °C) to monitor their long-term stability. As shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†), upon exposure to air for 50 days, the PCE of the devices with TFTN-Br, FTFN-Br and FTTFN-Br can still retain approximately 66%, 68% and 63% of the original value, respectively, along with well-maintained Jsc, Voc, and FF.50 These results indicated that the stability of the device can be effectively improved by incorporating SMEs as the cathode buffer layer.
Conclusions
In summary, three fluorene-based alcohol-soluble small molecular conjugated electrolytes, TFTN-Br, FTFN-Br and FTTFN-Br, bearing quaternary ammonium ions on their side chains, were successfully designed and synthesized as the cathode interlayer in P3HT:PC61BM BHJ i-PSCs. Employing SMEs as the interfacial layer effectively lowered the energy barrier, fine tuned the work function and improved the inherent interface compatibility. Conspicuously, the device using TFTN-Br as the ETL achieved a notable PCE of 3.8%. In comparison to the devices using FTFN-Br (3.1%) and FTTFN-Br (3.5%), the devices composed of TFTN-Br show a higher Jsc, FF and Voc, originating from the different conformation of their assembly onto the electrode caused by the sequence of polar groups in the SMEs, consequently impacting the dipole moment and interface morphology. Moreover, the better long-term stability in air observed indicates that the SMEs are a potential candidate as an ETL. Our study boosts the understanding of the small molecular electrolytes cathode interlayer for i-PSCs and provides a new point of view towards the development of novel cathode interlayer materials for i-PSCs.
