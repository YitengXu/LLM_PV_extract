    , Accepted 15th October 2019First published on 15th October 2019AbstractPhotocatalytic removal of phenol and its derivatives has received increasing attention since they are often discharged into the environment through wastewaters and may cause unpredictable environmental hazards and risks. Herein, porous ZnO nanosheets were initially synthesized via a simple surfactant-free route, and then were decorated with Pd nanoparticles (NPs) as well-defined Pd/ZnO nanocomposites. The well-defined Pd/ZnO nanocomposites are found to exhibit excellent photocatalytic activity and photochemical stability for the removal of phenol from water. The photocatalytic activity of Pd/ZnO nanocomposites can reach up to nearly 100% phenol decomposition in 60 min under UV light irradiation, which is about two and a half times that of pure ZnO nanosheets. Moreover, Pd/ZnO nanocomposites present good reusability with no decrease in the photocatalytic activity after four cycles of reuse. Obviously, the Pd/ZnO nanocomposites show much enhanced photocatalytic removal of phenol in comparison with the pure ZnO nanosheets. The small-sized and highly-dispersed Pd NPs deposited on the surface of ZnO nanosheets are responsible for the enhanced photocatalytic activity because they can act as electron sinks to accelerate the electron–hole separation. These highly efficient and stable Pd/ZnO nanocomposites endow themselves with promising application potential in the photocatalytic removal of phenolic pollutants in wastewater.
1. Introduction
With the rapid development of urbanization and industrialization, environmental wastewater pollution coming from various persistent and hazardous organic pollutants has been attracting extensive attention in the past decades. Phenol and its derivatives are considered as priority pollutants because they are hazardous to living beings due to their acute toxicity and bio-recalcitrant nature.1,2 These toxic compounds are often discharged into the environment through wastewaters from various industries, such as tanning, pharmaceuticals, oil refineries, petroleum production, paper making, paint manufacturing, etc.2,3 Owing to its high stability and bioaccumulation, the presence of phenol in aqueous environments is dangerous for the aquatic ecosystem and human health, even at low concentrations.4 Because of its stability and solubility in water, its removal to a secure level (0.1–1.0 mg L−1) is a difficult process.4–6 Semiconductor photocatalysis is considered as an advanced oxidation and environment-friendly technology that uses light energy in generating strongly oxidizing hydroxyl radicals (˙OH), which can oxidize not only phenolic contaminants, but also various kinds of organic pollutants in wastewaters.6
ZnO is one of the most popular metal oxide semiconductor materials with a wide-band-gap energy (3.37 eV) and large excitonic binding energy (60 meV) at room temperature.7 ZnO has been widely used for catalysts,7–13 nanolasers,14,15 gas sensors,16–19 solar cells,20,21 and so on. In particular, ZnO has received considerable research interest in the field of photocatalysis due to its prominent electronic and photonic properties, non-toxicity, low cost, and high catalytic efficiency.2 It has been reported that ZnO shows catalytic properties for the photocatalytic removal of phenol and its derivatives under UV light irradiation.5,22–26 However, most published studies show that the complete removal of phenol over ZnO photocatalyst is achieved in more than 3 h of UV irradiation. The limited photocatalytic efficiency of ZnO is ascribed to the rapid recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs and the stable benzene ring structure of phenolic compounds. Hence, it is quite essential to explore high-performance photocatalysts to degrade phenol and its derivatives from wastewaters.
In order to enhance the photocatalytic efficiency of ZnO, considerable efforts have been dedicated to the study of retarding the recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs using various strategies, including doping with non-metals,27 coupling with other materials,28,29 loading transition metals,30–39etc. In particular, noble metals deposited on the surface of ZnO, such as Ag/ZnO,32,33 Pt/ZnO,34 Au/ZnO,35–37 and Pd/ZnO,38,39 have been extensively used in the field of photocatalysts. However, to the best of our knowledge, the Pd/ZnO photocatalyst applied in the degradation of phenol has not been reported.
In this work, we have successfully prepared porous wurtzite ZnO nanosheets through a facile hydrothermal process without using any surfactant or template. Then, these porous ZnO nanosheets are employed as a support material for well-defined Pd/ZnO nanocomposites, which exhibit excellent photocatalytic activity and good reusability for the removal of phenol from water. It is believed that the well-defined Pd/ZnO nanocomposites have a wide range of application prospects in the treatment of phenolic wastewater.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials
K2PdCl4 (AR; SinoPlatinum Co., Ltd, China); CO(NH2)2 and Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (AR; Sino-Pharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd, China); and ultrapure water (18 MΩ cm) were used throughout the experiments. All chemicals were used as received without further purification.
2.2. Preparation of porous ZnO nanosheets
Porous ZnO nanosheets were synthesized through a facile hydrothermal method followed by a calcination treatment. Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (5 mmol; 1.488 g) and CO(NH2)2 (10 mmol; 0.600 g) were dissolved in 70 mL of ultrapure water under stirring to form a clear solution. The solution was then transferred to a 100 mL Teflon-lined steel autoclave and maintained at 150 °C for 10 h. After cooling the mixture to room temperature, the precipitate was centrifuged and washed with ultrapure water several times and then dried at 80 °C for 8 h under vacuum. Finally, porous ZnO nanosheets were obtained by subsequent calcination of the sample at 500 °C in a muffle furnace for 4 h.
2.3. Preparation of Pd/ZnO nanocomposites
Pd/ZnO nanocomposites were prepared by a wet impregnation method. 32.6 mg of K2PdCl4 was dissolved in 15 mL of ultrapure water to form a yellow solution, and then 1.06 g of ZnO prepared as above was dispersed into the solution with vigorous magnetic stirring at room temperature for 10 h. The solid product was centrifuged and dried at 80 °C for 8 h under vacuum. The dried sample was calcined at 400 °C for 4 h. Finally, the calcined sample was reduced in a pure hydrogen atmosphere at 300 °C for 3 h to obtain Pd/ZnO nanocomposites. The theoretical Pd loading of the catalyst is 1.0 wt%.
2.4. Catalyst characterization
The morphologies of the samples were observed by using field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, a Hitachi SU-8010 system). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) were performed on a Tecnai G2 F20 field-emission transmission electron microscope operating at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. The samples were prepared by dropping an ethanolic dispersion of samples onto carbon-coated copper grids using a pipettor, and the solvent was allowed to evaporate at room temperature. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were measured on a glass wafer by using a Rigaku MiniFlex 600 diffractometer with a Cu-Kα X ray source (λ = 1.5406 Å). UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV-DRS) was performed on an Agilent Technologies Cary 60 spectrophotometer equipped with a diffuse reflectance accessory, and the spectra were recorded in the range of 200–800 nm using BaSO4 as the reference sample. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface areas and Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) pore size distribution of the samples were determined by N2 adsorption–desorption at liquid nitrogen temperature (77 K), which was performed on a Micromeritics ASAP 2460. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed on a NETZSCH STA 2500 SYSTEM in N2 with the sample heated in an Al2O3 crucible at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1.
2.5. Photocatalytic experiments
The photocatalytic activities of the samples were studied by using the degradation of aqueous phenol solution with an initial concentration of 50 mg L−1 under irradiation of a 36 W UV-light tube (λ = 365 nm, optical power density: 1.8 W cm−2). 75 mg of catalyst powder was added to 50 mL of phenol solution in a quartz cup, corresponding to a catalyst dosage of 1.5 g L−1. Before UV-light irradiation, the whole system was placed in the dark under magnetic stirring for 60 min to ensure an adsorption/desorption equilibrium. During the UV-light irradiation, about 4 mL aliquots were sampled at given time intervals, and centrifuged. Then, the top clear solution of phenol was analyzed by using a UV-vis spectrophotometer (TU-1901, PERSEE, Beijing). The degradation ratio was monitored by measuring the absorption of phenol at the wavelength of 270 nm, which was calculated according to the formula: η = [(A0 − At)/A0] × 100%, where A0 is the absorbance of phenol solution with the initial concentration, and At is the absorbance of phenol solution measured after photocatalytic degradation. For comparison, a blank control experiment (pure phenol solution without photocatalyst under UV-light irradiation) was also determined in order to establish the effect of photolysis and catalysis on the conversion of phenol. Finally, the solution was analyzed by using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC, an Agilent Technologies 1260 Infinity II system) equipped with a UV detector (1260 VWD), using a mixture of acetonitrile and water (v/v = 3:7) as the mobile phase at a total flow rate of 0.9 mL min−1.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Morphology and structure of materials
The XRD characterization was employed to identify the crystalline phases and the purity of the synthesized samples. Fig. 1 presents the XRD patterns of the precursor, ZnO nanosheets and Pd/ZnO nanocomposites. The diffraction peaks of the precursor in Fig. 1a agree well with zinc hydroxide carbonate [Zn4CO3(OH)6·H2O] (denoted as ZHC, JCPDS: No. 11-0287).40 As shown in Fig. 1b, all the diffraction peaks of the as-prepared ZnO nanosheets perfectly match with the standard diffraction data for a hexagonal wurtzite structure of ZnO (JCPDS: No. 65-3411), indicating that the ZHC precursor can be transformed into a typical wurtzite ZnO structure after annealing at 500 °C. No traces of extra impurity peaks were detected, which confirms the good crystalline nature and purity of the as-prepared ZnO nanosheets. The sharp diffraction peaks in the XRD pattern of the Pd/ZnO nanocomposites are assigned to the crystalline phase of ZnO. The main diffraction peak corresponding to metallic palladium (2θ = 39.8°) was not observed for the Pd/ZnO nanocomposites, suggesting that the Pd NPs are highly dispersed on the surface of the ZnO support or the amount of Pd loading (1 wt%) is too small to be detected.

UV-vis spectroscopy is often applied to explain the optical absorption properties of semiconductors. Fig. 2 shows the UV-vis absorption spectrum of ZnO nanosheets. The as-prepared ZnO has a strong absorption band ranging from 360 nm to 400 nm, which can be attributed to the electron transitions from the valence band to the conduction band (O2p–Zn3d).41 The direct band gap energy (Eg) of ZnO can be estimated from the UV-Vis spectra via a Tauc plot of (αhν)2versus photon energy (hν) according to the Tauc relationship:42,43αhν = A(hν − Eg)1/2, where α is the absorption coefficient, hν is the photon energy, Eg is the direct band gap energy, and A is a constant. As illustrated in the inset of Fig. 2, the estimated band gap energy of the as-prepared ZnO nanosheets is about 3.2 eV. TGA analysis was performed to examine the thermal stability of the ZHC precursor. As shown in Fig. 3, the ZHC precursor can remain stable up to 240 °C, and starts to decompose at 240 °C. When the temperature reaches 500 °C, the ZHC precursor has completely transformed into ZnO crystal, consistent with the XRD results. The total weight loss is about 25%, close to the theoretical value (26%), which can be ascribed to the loss of H2O and CO2 gases.

The morphologies and microstructures of the samples were investigated by electron microscopy techniques. Fig. 4a presents a low magnification SEM image of the ZHC precursor, showing that the precursor has a nanosheet structure. The detailed ZnO nanostructures were confirmed by SEM, TEM, and HRTEM images and the corresponding selective area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern. The SEM image (Fig. 4b) of ZnO reveals that the nanosheet morphology is well maintained after annealing at 500 °C for 4 h. Nevertheless, it is clear that a large amount of irregular pores are randomly distributed in the nanosheets of ZnO. These pores are caused by the release of H2O and CO2 gases during the thermal decomposition of the ZHC precursor, which is verified by the above result of the TGA curve. In addition, the TEM image (Fig. 4c) further clearly confirms the highly porous nature of the ZnO nanosheets. The HRTEM image of ZnO in Fig. 4d displays two distinct sets of well-resolved lattice fringes with interplanar spacings of 0.264 and 0.162 nm, corresponding to (0002) and (110) planes of the hexagonal wurtzite ZnO phase, respectively.44 The corresponding SAED pattern (inset of Fig. 4d) exhibits a series of diffraction points, indicating the single-crystalline nature of the nanosheets. Fig. 4e shows the TEM image of the Pd/ZnO nanocomposites. The Pd NPs are highly dispersed on the surface of the ZnO support. On the basis of the size distribution histogram shown in the inset of Fig. 4e, the mean size of Pd NPs is very small (about 2.9 nm). The HRTEM image (Fig. 4f) of Pd/ZnO nanocomposites shows that the interval between two lattice fringes of Pd NPs is ca. 0.222 nm, corresponding to the interplanar distance of the (111) plane of the face-centered cubic (fcc) Pd.45

The inset at the bottom right corner of (e) corresponds to the size distributions of the Pd NPs. 
The detailed structural characterizations of the samples were further carried out by using nitrogen adsorption–desorption measurements. Fig. 5 shows the nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms of ZnO nanosheets and Pd/ZnO nanocomposites. According to the IUPAC classification, the isotherms of the ZnO and Pd/ZnO samples are similar and both belong to type IV with a type-H3 hysteresis loop, indicating that the ZnO and Pd/ZnO samples possess a mesoporous structure due to the aggregation of the sheet particles. The BET specific surface areas of ZnO nanosheets and Pd/ZnO nanocomposites are 10.86 and 11.80 m2 g−1, respectively. Thus, the specific surface area of ZnO does not significantly change after the Pd NPs were deposited on the surface of ZnO. The ZnO nanosheets and Pd/ZnO nanocomposites have a similar BJH pore size distribution (insets of Fig. 5). Both of them have two types of pore sizes of ca. 3 and ca. 34 nm. Nevertheless, the proportion of small pore size (ca. 3 nm) of Pd/ZnO nanocomposites is obviously lower than that of ZnO nanosheets, which is associated with the plugging of small pores caused by the tiny Pd NPs supported on the surface of ZnO nanosheets.

3.2. Photocatalytic performance of materials
The photocatalytic experiments of phenol decomposition of Pd/ZnO nanocomposites and ZnO nanosheets were performed under UV light irradiation, and the blank control experiment (pure phenol solution without photocatalyst) was also evaluated under the same photocatalytic conditions for comparison. Fig. 6a shows the UV-vis absorption spectra of phenol degradation for different UV light irradiation times over Pd/ZnO nanocomposites. It can be seen that the intensity of the phenol characteristic absorption peak around 270 nm significantly decreases with the increase of the UV-light irradiation time and completely disappears after 60 min irradiation. It is worth noting that new absorbance peaks at 246 nm and 288 nm emerge and then disappear during the photodegradation process, which can be attributed to the formation and fading of benzoquinone and hydroquinone with the maximum absorption peaks at 246 and 288 nm, respectively.46,47 Therefore, these results imply that the main intermediates in the phenol photocatalytic degradation process can be identified as benzoquinone and hydroquinone. HPLC analysis indicates that no organic product is detected in the final product of phenol degradation after 60 min UV light irradiation, suggesting that phenol finally degrades into CO2 and H2O, and inorganic molecules, which is in agreement with the results obtained by the UV-vis spectra. As presented in Fig. 6b, the degradation rate of phenol shows no increase for 60 min in the presence of the photocatalyst under dark conditions. A similar result for the blank control experiment (photolysis) was also obtained. These results indicate that the adsorption of phenol over the photocatalyst and the photolysis of phenol can both be ignored in comparison with the photocatalysis. The photocatalysis results in terms of phenol degradation evidenced a rapid increase of degradation rate in the presence of Pd/ZnO nanocomposites with 1 wt% Pd loading. It is noteworthy that Pd/ZnO nanocomposites always show much better photocatalytic activity than that of ZnO nanosheets. In particular, the degradation rate of phenol over Pd/ZnO nanocomposites can reach nearly 100% after UV-light irradiation for 60 min, which is about two and a half times that of ZnO nanosheets. These results demonstrate that the decoration of Pd NPs on the surface of ZnO can give rise to a significantly enhanced photocatalytic activity for the phenol decomposition.

(b) Photocatalytic degradation rates of phenol over Pd/ZnO nanocomposites and ZnO nanosheets under UV-light irradiation (blank control corresponding to pure phenol solution without photocatalyst). (c) Repetitive use of Pd/ZnO nanocomposites (phenol initial concentration: 50 mg L−1; photocatalyst dosage: 1.5 g L−1). 
The study of catalyst reusability is very important from both academic and industrial viewpoints to ascertain its long term use. To evaluate the photochemical stability of the as-synthesized photocatalyst, repeated experiments of the Pd/ZnO nanocomposites for the removal of phenol were conducted. As shown in Fig. 6c, the high photocatalytic activity of Pd/ZnO can be stable after four cycles of reuse. This indicates that the synthesized Pd/ZnO nanocomposites exhibit good reusability and stability for practical applications in the treatment of phenolic wastewater.
3.3. Photocatalytic mechanism of Pd/ZnO nanocomposites
A possible photocatalytic mechanism of Pd/ZnO nanocomposites is also proposed in Fig. 7. When ZnO is illuminated by UV light with photon energy higher than or equal to the band gap of the semiconductor, electrons in the valence band (VB) can be excited to the conduction band (CB) with simultaneous generation of the same amount of holes in the VB. Then, the photoelectrons can be easily trapped by adsorbed O2 to produce ˙O2− radicals, and the photoinduced holes can be captured by surface hydroxyl to produce ˙OH radicals.48 These ˙O2− and ˙OH are very strong oxidizing agents,49 which can oxidize most organic contaminants like phenol to CO2 and H2O. However, the photogenerated electron–hole pairs can also recombine to decrease the available photocatalytic efficiency. To reduce the recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs, one efficient way is to deposit noble metals (such as Au, Ag, Pt, and Pd) on the surface of ZnO.33,39 The photogenerated electrons in the CB of the ZnO can be transferred to the noble metal Pd NPs due to the Schottky barrier formed at the metal–semiconductor interface, while the holes can remain on the surfaces of ZnO.39 Therefore, the small-sized and highly-dispersed Pd NPs supported on ZnO can act as electron sinks and facilitate the photoinduced electron–hole pair separation. The high separation rate can generate more holes reacting with surface hydroxyl to produce ˙OH radicals, and more electrons reacting with O2 to generate ˙O2− radicals, and thus enhance the photocatalytic activity.
 Fig. 7  The schematic mechanism of the photocatalytic removal of phenol over Pd/ZnO nanocomposites under UV light irradiation. 
Based on the previous results of UV-vis absorption spectra and HPLC analysis, the photocatalytic degradation of phenol involves first the formation of benzoquinone and hydroquinone, and then the subsequent opening of the aromatic ring to yield biodegradable aliphatic acids, and finally mineralization to CO2 and H2O.6,22 The possible photodegradation pathway of phenol is illustrated in Scheme 1.47 However, further experimental and theoretical studies are still required to gain more insight into the detailed photocatalytic mechanism for phenol degradation in our future work.

4. Conclusions
In summary, porous ZnO nanosheets were preliminarily synthesized through a facile hydrothermal method followed by a calcination treatment, and then well-defined Pd/ZnO nanocomposites were prepared by modifying the ZnO nanosheets with Pd NPs. The well-defined Pd/ZnO nanocomposites exhibit excellent photocatalytic activity with nearly 100% phenol decomposition in 60 min under UV light irradiation, and good reusability with no decrease in the photocatalytic activity after four cycles of reuse. Moreover, the Pd/ZnO nanocomposites show strongly enhanced photocatalytic activity for the removal of phenol from water compared with the pure ZnO nanosheets. The enhanced photocatalytic activity is mainly attributed to the small-sized and highly-dispersed Pd NPs deposited on the surface of ZnO nanosheets, which can act as electron sinks to effectively enhance the electron–hole separation efficiency, and consequently improve the photocatalytic efficiency. This work may help to provide insight into developing and designing new photocatalysts with excellent performance for phenol removal.
