    , Accepted 2nd January 2015First published on 2nd January 2015AbstractLithium–sulfur batteries are promising candidates for the next generation of energy storage systems due to the high specific capacity of the sulfur cathode (1675 mA h g−1) and their low cost. However, the intrinsic insulating properties of sulfur, the dissolution of polysulfides, and the huge volume expansion during cycling still hinder their practical application. We introduced the electroactive polymer poly(N-vinylcarbazole) (PVK) into the lithium–sulfur system as a conductive matrix and sulfur reservoir. Using a facile two-step dissolution–precipitation treatment, novel core–shell sulfur quantum dot/PVK (SQD/PVK) nanocomposites were synthesized, in which a large number of SQDs (about 5 nm in size) with plenty of internal void spaces were encapsulated in the PVK shell. The sulfur core consisted of uniformly dispersed SQDs and large void spaces, which formed effective transportation pathways for both electrons and ions among the SQDs. They also acted as a buffer zone to accommodate the volume expansion during cycling and facilitated wetting of the electrolyte. The conducting PVK shell coated on the surface of the sulfur core can restrain dissolution of the polysulfide and suppress the shuttle effect. Galvanostatic testing showed that this SQD/PVK nanocomposite maintained a specific capacity of 687.7 mA h g−1 after 200 cycles at 0.5 C, corresponding to an 89.7% capacity retention with only 0.05% capacity degradation per cycle. Even after long-term cycling, the electrode could still deliver 488.6 mA h g−1 at a rate of 0.5 C after 600 cycles and 443.9 mA h g−1 at 0.75 C after 500 cycles.
Introduction
Lithium–sulfur (Li/S) batteries have attracted much attention with respect to their possible use as high energy density storage devices in the next generation of power storage systems. Li/S batteries have a theoretical energy density of 2600 W h kg−1, which is almost three times the energy density of current lithium ion batteries.1 The sulfur cathode can deliver a high specific capacity of 1672 mA h g−1, more than five times that of the widely used LiCoO2. Sulfur is also abundant, low cost and environmentally benign. Despite these advantages, several challenges hinder the practical application of Li/S batteries. The polysulfide intermediates can dissolve in the organic electrolyte, diffuse to the anode and react with lithium to form insoluble solid Li2S2/Li2S at the anodic region. This “shuttle effect” causes an irreversible loss of active sulfur, which leads to a fast fading of capacity and a low Coulombic efficiency. In addition, sulfur, with a poor intrinsic electrical conductivity and large volumetric expansion/contraction (about 76%), may form during the conversion processes of sulfur and Li2S and lead to a low specific capacity and limited cycle life.2–5 The specific capacity and cycle life of Li/S batteries are therefore limited by the sluggish kinetics of the active material, the loss of electroactive composition and the mechanical degradations of the electrode.
To address these issues, much effort has been directed to the design and construction of novel microstructured/nanostructured sulfur cathodes by modifying the cathode materials. Significant advances have been achieved using carbon,6–19 oxides,20 or conducting polymers21–25 as hosts for the sulfur cathode. Carbon-based host materials, including mesoporous carbon spheres,6,7 hollow/porous carbon fibers/carbon nanotubes,8–12,14 microporous carbon papers,15 and graphene oxides16–18 have shown impressive cell performance. These sulfur hosts are commonly believed to serve not only as conducting agents to facilitate the electron transport of the active material, but also as reservoirs to capture the soluble polysulfides and to improve the utilization of the electroactive component.19 However, relatively little effort has been put into controlling the volume change of sulfur during cycling, which results in cracking and exfoliation of the host materials and capacity decay. Recent developments using sulfur infiltrated into oxides or conducting polymers to form core–shell or yolk–shell structures have demonstrated better electrochemical performance. The S@TiO2,20 S@PVP,24 and S@PANI23 core–shell or yolk–shell nanoarchitectures delivered improved cyclability as a result of their internal void space, which can accommodate the large volumetric expansion of sulfur during cycling and suppress the dissolution of polysulfides. Decreasing the size of sulfur to form nanoparticles and nanocrystals is an alternative effective approach to improving the diffusion kinetics and simultaneously alleviating the volumetric expansion of sulfur. This is because nanosized sulfur has a higher specific surface area, shorter Li+ and electron diffusion distances, and better electrolyte wetting, which weakens the insulating nature of sulfur and facilitates the electrochemical process. Composites formed by confining ultrafine sulfur nanoparticles in the internal void spaces of conductive, partially elastic host materials could integrate multiple effects to enhance the performance of sulfur. Ultrafine sulfur nanoparticle (10–20 nm)/PEDOT composites have been prepared and have been shown to have both a high capacity and good performance.25 Quantum dots (QDs) have been widely studied because of their interesting optical and electrical properties and have been used in solar cells and batteries.26–28 However, sulfur QD (SQD) (<10 nm) cathodes for Li/S batteries have not yet been reported.
Conducting polymers have been used as the conductive matrix and structural support for metal or metal oxide anodes29–31 and sulfur cathodes21–23,25,32 because the adjustable conductive structures and elastic polymer chain backbone can form good electron pathways and accommodate the volume change of the electrode, thereby improving the cyclability and reversible capacity. However, the preparation of sulfur/conducting polymer composites often requires elaborate procedures, especially for complex polymerization processes, because there are few solvents that can dissolve conducting polymers. Poly(N-vinylcarbazole) (PVK), a non-conjugated polymer containing pendant π-electrons, can be transformed to an electrically conducting state by doping as a result of the π-stacked structure of the carbazole moiety in the polymer. This carbazole moiety is widely used as a hole-transporting agent and structural matrix in photoconductors.33–36 Yao et al.37 investigated the use of PVK as the cathode in lithium ion batteries, which showed an initial discharge capacity of 125 and 117 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles. Inspired by these electrochemical properties, the use of PVK as a conductive matrix and structural support for the sulfur cathode was thought to be a good choice for Li/S batteries.
In this work, core–shell SQDs/PVK nanocomposites were prepared via a facile two-step dissolution–precipitation treatment in which a large number of SQDs (about 5 nm in size) with plenty of internal void spaces were encapsulated in the PVK shell. These SQD/PVK nanocomposites showed a high capacity and stable performance over a long cycle life. This was ascribed to the unique core–shell structure that encapsulated the SQDs in the polymer shell with large internal void spaces to accommodate the volume expansion and to suppress the dissolution of polysulfides. The SQDs were able to greatly shorten the electron transport distances and provide more active sites, thus facilitating the electrode kinetics. The composites produced an initial discharge capacity of 861.6 mA h g−1 at 0.2 C. A specific capacity of 687.7 mA h g−1 was retained after 200 cycles at 0.5 C, corresponding to an 89.7% capacity retention with only 0.05% capacity degradation per cycle. Even after long-term cycling, the electrode could still deliver 488.6 mA h g−1 at 0.5 C after 600 cycles and 443.9 mA h g−1 at 0.75 C after 500 cycles.
Experimental
Preparation of S/PVK composite and SQD/PVK nanocomposites
Sulfur (≥99.5%, AR, Chengdu Kelong Chemical Reagent Co., China) was dissolved in carbon disulfide (CS2) (99%) (100 mg ml−1). PVK (Mn = 25000–50000; Sigma-Aldrich) was then added to the sulfur/CS2 solution and uniformly dispersed by constant stirring. This mixture was stirred at 40 °C until the CS2 solvent had completely evaporated. The resulting solid compound was heated in a tube furnace filled with nitrogen at 155 °C for 12 h and then at 160 °C for another 6 h to obtain the S/PVK composite. Three S/PVK composites with different sulfur contents were prepared using this method: 61.6 wt% (S/PVK-A); 70.8 wt% (S/PVK-B); and 81.9 wt% (S/PVK-C).
When the SQD/PVK nanocomposite was used to prepare the electrode by dispersing in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) (≥99%, AR), the PVK in the composite dissolved and then precipitated again. To avoid interference, SQD/PVK composites were also prepared by dissolving the S/PVK composite in NMP without the other electrode components, followed by drying under vacuum. Three SQD/PVK composites with different sulfur contents were prepared using this method: 61.6 wt% (SQD/PVK-A); 70.8 wt% (SQD/PVK-B); and 80.9 wt% (SQD/PVK-C).
Materials characterization
The surface morphological analyses and determination of the elemental distribution were carried out by scanning electron microscopy (SEM; Hitachi S-4800) with energy-dispersive spectrometry (EDS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM; Carl Zeiss SMT Pte Ltd, Libra 200 FE, 200 kV). The crystalline structure of the samples was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a Bruker DX-1000 diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation in the 2θ range 5–90° at a scan rate of 0.08° s−1. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of the S/PVK electrode was carried out on a METTLER instrument to determine the sulfur content over the temperature range 50–800 °C in nitrogen at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were recorded using a PerkinElmer Spectrum Two instrument from 4000 to 500 cm−1.
Electrochemical measurements
The working electrodes were prepared by dispersing 70 wt% active material, 20 wt% acetylene black and 10 wt% polyvinylidene fluoride in NMP solvent to form a homogeneous slurry, followed by plastering the slurry onto aluminum foil using a doctor blade and then roll-pressing to produce electrode films with an average sulfur loading of 1 mg cm−2. These films were dried at 50 °C for 12 h in a vacuum oven before use. CR-2032 coin-type cells were assembled in an argon-filled glove box by using these prepared disks as the cathode, metal lithium foil as the anode, Celgard 2400 as a separator, and 1 M lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide dissolved in a mixture of 1,2-dimethoxyethane and 1,3-dioxolane (1:1 in volume) as the electrolyte. Galvanostatic measurements were made using the CT2001A battery program controlling test system (China-Land Co., Ltd). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were performed on a VSP (Bio-Logic SAS) electrochemical workstation from 1.0 to 3.0 V versus Li+/Li and an amplitude of 10 mV in the frequency range 200 kHz to 100 mHz. For comparison, a bare sulfur electrode and a pure PVK electrode were prepared and measured under the same conditions as the S/PVK composites.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1 shows the fabrication processes for the S/PVK and SQD/PVK nanocomposites. Sulfur is first dissolved in CS2, followed by the addition of PVK. As both sulfur and PVK are soluble in CS2, the ternary S/CS2/PVK system forms a homogeneous solution. With constant stirring at 40 °C, the sulfur and PVK simultaneously precipitate from the solution with the evaporation of the CS2 solvent, in which PVK functions as a dispersant to prevent the freshly formed sulfur nanoparticles from aggregating. Heat treatment is then applied to the obtained precursor to remove a portion of sulfur particles and to obtain a uniform S/PVK composite with an appropriate sulfur content. After dissolving in the NMP solvent and drying during the electrode preparation processes, the PVK polymer in the obtained product is then dissolved and precipitated again. The PVK reshapes and wraps the sulfur particles to form the SQD/PVK composite.37
 Fig. 1  Schematic illustration of the synthesis of the SQD/PVK composites and the lithium ion diffusion process. 
To understand the microstructure of the composites after different treatments, SEM images of the S/PVK and SQD/PVK composites were obtained (Fig. 2). Fig. 2a shows that the polymer with a porous structure wraps around these sulfur nanoparticles. It can be seen that a portion of sulfur particles are dispersed on the surface of the S/PVK composites, which corresponds to the sublimation and precipitation of sulfur on the surface of the composites during the heat treatment processes (Fig. 2b). The high magnification inset image (Fig. 2b) shows that the average size of these sulfur particles is <10 nm. The good solubility of PVK and sulfur in CS2 may lead to the high uniformity of the S/CS2/PVK solution and the subsequent S/PVK composite, thus restricting the aggregation of the sulfur nanoparticles. To further understand the formation mechanism, a comparison experiment without PVK was performed by directly precipitating sulfur from the S/CS2 solution. The SEM images (ESI, Fig. S1†) show similar sulfur nanoparticles, but with obvious agglomeration. In addition, without the dispersion and restriction of PVK, these sulfur nanoparticles aggregate into large sulfur particles >2 μm. Fig. 2c and d show the morphology of the SQD/PVK nanocomposites. It can be seen that, after the dissolution and precipitation of PVK in the NMP solvent, the sulfur nanoparticles are uniformly encapsulated into the PVK shell to form a core–shell structure with no obvious agglomeration of sulfur. Such a core–shell structure could be attributed to the solubility of PVK in the NMP solvent, which leads to reshaping of the S/PVK composite. Fig. 2e and f show the energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectrum and the EDX elemental mapping of the core–shell SQD/PVK, respectively. The EDX spectrum confirms that sulfur exists in the composites and that sulfur and carbon are distributed uniformly in the core–shell SQD/PVK nanocomposite.

Fig. S2† and 3 show the TEM images of the S/PVK nanocomposites and SQD/PVK nanocomposites, respectively. For the S/PVK nanocomposites, the sulfur nanoparticles are uniformly dispersed and connected by the PVK backbone (Fig. S2a and b†), which corresponds to the SEM images in Fig. 2a and b. The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images in Fig. S2c and S2d† confirm that PVK can restrict the agglomeration of sulfur nanoparticles and form ultrafine sulfur nanoparticles (<10 nm) in the PVK shell. The SEM images of the SQD/PVK composites (Fig. 3a and b) show the typical core–shell structure, indicating that the second dissolution and precipitation of PVK in NMP reshapes the morphology of the S/PVK nanocomposites, leading to complete wrapping of sulfur in the PVK shell. The HRTEM image (Fig. 3c) clearly shows that the sulfur core, consisting of uniformly dispersed SQDs with the majority about 5 nm in size (range 3–8 nm), is encapsulated by the PVK shell, indicating that the addition of PVK could restrain the aggregation of the SQDs and function as a wrapping matrix. The HRTEM image in Fig. 3d shows that the SQDs are well crystallized with a d spacing of about 0.32 nm, corresponding to the (040) plane of sulfur.

The XRD patterns of pure PVK, pure sulfur, the S/PVK nanocomposites and the SQD/PVK nanocomposites with different sulfur contents are given in Fig. S3a† and 4a. The XRD pattern of pure PVK shows a typical amorphous structure with a broad peak centered at 20.4° (2θ). The XRD pattern of elemental sulfur shows two prominent peaks at 23 and 28°, corresponding to an Fddd orthorhombic structure of S8 (JCPDS, PDF#08-0247). Compared with the pattern of elemental sulfur, the XRD patterns of the S/PVK nanocomposites and SQD/PVK nanocomposites with different sulfur contents show well-matched signals of orthorhombic sulfur with no new peaks, indicating that the PVK coating process did not introduce new phases.

To determine the sulfur content in the different nanocomposites, TGA was carried out under a nitrogen flow (Fig. 4b and S3b†). The TGA curve of pure PVK shows a two-step weight loss process. The slight weight loss in the first step at around 200 °C is assigned to the glass transition point of PVK, whereas the complete weight loss at around 400 °C is attributed to the decomposition of the PVK, corresponding to the degradation of the side chains and polymer backbone.37 Accordingly, a two-step decomposition process is observed in the TGA curves of the S/PVK and SQD/PVK nanocomposites. The abrupt weight loss before 350 °C can be assigned to the sublimation of sulfur,38 which indicates that the amount of elemental sulfur in the SQD/PVK-A, SQD/PVK-B, and SQD/PVK-C nanocomposites is 61.6, 70.8, and 80.9 wt%, respectively. This is identical to the amount of sulfur in the S/PVK composites. The second weight loss between 400 and 500 °C can be ascribed to the decomposition of PVK, which is consistent with that of pure PVK.
The FTIR spectra of pure PVK and the S/PVK and SQD/PVK nanocomposites are shown in Fig. S3c† and 4c. For pure PVK, the absorption bands at about 3050–2920 cm−1 are associated with the C–H stretching vibrations of the aryl groups in PVK. Three characteristic bands at 1600, 1482, and 1450 cm−1 can be ascribed to the CC stretching vibrations in the aryl skeleton. The characteristic absorption bands at 751 and 725 cm−1 (doublet) are assigned to the carbazole group.34,39 For the FTIR spectra of the S/PVK and SQD/PVK nanocomposites, all the peaks are consistent with those of PVK. No new peak was observed in the nanocomposites, showing that there was no chemical reaction between the sulfur and PVK, which confirms that PVK serves as a conductive matrix and structural support.
Comparing the XRD, TGA, and FTIR results for the SQD/PVK nanocomposites with those for the S/PVK nanocomposites, no obvious change was found, showing that no side-effects occurred after treatment with NMP, only the morphological change.
To explore the benefits of these structural changes on the electrochemical performance, a series of electrochemical measurements was performed. Cyclic voltammograms of three SQD/PVK nanocomposite cathodes with different sulfur contents (SQD/PVK-A, SQD/PVK-B, and SQD/PVK-C) and a bare sulfur cathode were obtained between 1.0 and 3.0 V at a scan rate of 0.05 mV s−1 (Fig. S4a†). Two reduction peaks at about 2.22 and 2.0 V were observed in the CV profiles of the bare sulfur electrode during the reduction processes, which result from the multiple reduction mechanisms of elemental sulfur with Li metal.21–23,40–42 The first reduction peak at around 2.22 V corresponds to the reduction of the S8 rings to higher order Li polysulfides (Li2Sx, 4 < x < 8), whereas the second weaker peak at about 2.0 V can be assigned to the further reduction of higher order polysulfides to lower order polysulfides (Li2Sx, 2 ≤ x ≤ 4). The oxidation peak near 2.6 V is attributed to a de-lithiation process, with the transformation of Li2S to Li2Sx and eventually to S8.21–23 Compared with that of the pure sulfur electrode, the CV profiles of the SQD/PVK nanocomposites show similar redox peaks at some shifted positions. Among these cathode materials, the SQD/PVK-B cathode shows sharp, distinct cathodic peaks and the potential difference between the anodic peak and the cathodic peak is much smaller than that of the other electrodes, indicating that the PVK coating can reduce the polarization and inner resistance, resulting in a long cycle stability and high rate capacity.
To gain further insights into the effects of this core–shell SQD/PVK structure, electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were obtained for cells using pure PVK, SQD/PVK-A, SQD/PVK-B, SQD/PVK-C, and bare sulfur as the cathode before cycling (Fig. S4b†) and after five cycles (Fig. 5a). All the EIS spectra consist of a depressed semicircular loop in the high frequency (HF) region and an inclined line in the low frequency (LF) region, except for the two depressed semicircles observed for the freshly prepared SQD/PVK-A and SQD/PVK-C nanocomposites (Fig. S4b†). The HF semicircle indicates the charge transfer resistance (Rct) relating to charge transfer through the electrode/electrolyte interface. The LF inclined line represents the Warburg impedance (W0), which is related to the solid-state diffusion of Li ions into the electrode material. The pure PVK electrode clearly shows a significantly smaller semicircle than the other electrodes. The Rct values before cycling and after five cycles are nearly the same (<50 Ω), indicating the excellent interfacial properties. In contrast, the Rct of the SQD/PVK electrode before cycling (around 200 Ω) and after five cycles (around 150 Ω) were much smaller than those of pure sulfur (around 300 Ω), showing that the nanocomposites have distinctly improved electrochemical kinetics. For the freshly prepared SQD/PVK-A and SQD/PVK-C electrodes, it should be noted that the semicircle in the middle to LF range might result from the formation of insoluble polysulfide species, corresponding to less sharp and broad reduction peaks in the low voltage region of the CV curves (Fig. S4a†).

(b) Rate capabilities of the sulfur electrode and SQD/PVK nanocomposites. Cycling performance of sulfur and SQD/PVK nanocomposite electrode at a rate of (c) 0.2 C and (d) 0.5 C. 
Cells using these electrodes were also tested at different current rates (Fig. 5b–d). The reported C values are based on the mass and theoretical capacity of sulfur (1 C = 1672 mA h g−1). From Fig. 5b it can be seen that the specific capacities of the SQD/PVK-B electrodes are much higher than those of the SQD/PVK-A, SQD/PVK-C and sulfur electrodes at different rates. The SQD/PVK-B composite electrode delivers the highest discharge capacity of 1581.1 mA h g−1. It is in good agreement with the results of the CV curves. The specific capacities of SQD/PVK-B nanocomposites were 1581.1, 921.7, 824.7, 706.3, 640.7, 565.8, and 438.4 mA h g−1 at current densities of 0.02, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1 and 2 C, respectively. A stable discharge capacity of 880 mA h g−1 was recovered when the current rate was reduced back to 0.02 C, suggesting good structural stability of the composites even after high rate cycling.
The improvement in cycle stability of the SQD/PVK-B nanocomposite was more significant (Fig. 5c and d). The SQD/PVK-B electrode showed the best cycling performance at current rates of 0.2 and 0.5 C. The SQD/PVK-B electrode achieved a discharge capacity of 861.6 mA h g−1 at a current rate of 0.2 C, which is higher than the other two SQD/PVK electrodes (770.8 mA h g−1 for the SQD/PVK-A electrode and 739.5 mA h g−1 for the SQD/PVK-C electrode). After 200 cycles, the SQD/PVK-B electrode still retained a capacity of 640.4 mA h g−1 with a capacity retention of 74%. In contrast, the specific capacity of the bare sulfur electrode rapidly decreased from 460 to 207.3 mA h g−1 with 45% capacity retention after 200 cycles. The low conductivity of sulfur and the “shuttle effect” are the key factors restraining the high specific capacity and good cycle stability. However, these challenges were effectively tackled by using the core–shell SQD/PVK nanocomposites as cathode materials. Fig. 5d shows that the initial specific capacity of the SQD/PVK-B electrode was as high as 766.4 mA h g−1 at a current rate of 0.5 C. After 200 cycles the capacity retention was up to 89.7% (a decay of only 0.05% per cycle). Even after long-term cycling (600 cycles), the SQD/PVK-B electrode retained a discharge capacity of 488.6 mA h g−1, corresponding to a capacity retention of 63.8%, which demonstrates its superior electrochemical stability. Compared with previously reported results for sulfur/conducting polymer composite electrodes, it should be noted that the reversible capacity and long-term capacity retention are similar to those of the best electrodes reported previously under similar testing conditions (Table S1†).
It should be pointed out that the discharge capacity of the SQD/PVK-C electrode at 0.2 C (Fig. 5c) is larger than that of the bare S electrode, but the capacity decreases dramatically in the first 30 cycles and then remains stable with increasing cycle number. The improved specific capacity and capacity retention indicate that the PVK coating can improve the utilization of the active sulfur, suppress the dissolution of polysulfides, and enhance the cycling stability. After 200 cycles the specific capacity of the electrode reduced to 356.6 mA h g−1, which is 44% of the initial discharge capacity. We speculate that a certain amount of sulfur was not encapsulated in the polymer matrix and was directly exposed to the organic electrolyte as the sulfur content increased to a higher percentage. The unwrapped sulfur can be easily dissolved in the electrolyte during cycling and forms insoluble Li2S2, which causes irreversible sulfur loss and leads to fast fading of the capacity.

Fig. 6a shows the CV curves of the cell using the SQD/PVK-B nanocomposites as cathode materials. The reduction peaks at 2.2 and 1.9 V and the corresponding oxidation peak at 2.6 V overlapped well for five cycles, demonstrating that the electrochemical processes of the electrode were reversible. To obtain more information about the role of PVK in the electrode, the CV curves and cycling performance of the pure PVK electrode are presented in Fig. S5.† The CV profiles (Fig. S5a†) show that the redox peak can be assigned to the redox processes of sulfur, demonstrating that the electrochemical contribution is mostly from active sulfur. Galvanostatic testing (Fig. S5b†) showed that the pure PVK cathode can deliver a reversible capacity of 5.3 mA h g−1 and remain stable for 300 cycles. Compared with the reported test results in the voltage range 2.0–4.7 V, this result was obtained between 1 and 3 V, which does not include the main electrochemical reaction of PVK around 3.7 V. Therefore the specific capacity is much lower than reported previously.37 The capacity contribution of PVK to the overall capacity of the composite electrode was negligible.

Two discharge plateaus at approximately 2.2 and 1.9 V were observed for the SQD/PVK-B electrode, which is in good agreement with the CV curves in Fig. 6a. To determine more details about the electrode, the EIS of the SQD/PVK-B electrode during different cycles were measured at the fully discharged state (Fig. 6c). All the impedance plots were composed of one depressed semicircle in the HF region (Rct) and an inclined line in the LF region (W0). The intersection of the curve with the x-axis represents the bulk resistance of the composite electrode. It can be seen that, after the first ten cycles, Rct decreased dramatically compared with the value before cycling. Rct then decreased slowly from the 10th to the 50th cycle and then remained almost stable during the following cycles, corresponding to electrode activation processes in the initial cycles and the good electrode stability of the SQD wrapped in the PVK polymer. The Rct of the 300th cycle (67.9 Ω) was close to that of the 100th cycle (74.7 Ω).
It should be noted that the bulk resistance of the composites was stable in the first 10 cycles, then decreased in the following cycles to the 50th cycle. This may be attributed to electrode activation processes in the initial cycles. With increasing cycle number, the bulk resistance increased slightly from the 50th (66.7 Ω) to the 100th cycle (74.7 Ω), which may correspond to the dissolution of the small amounts of polysulfide intermediates formed during the long life cycles. After the 100th cycle, the resistance remained almost constant until the 300th cycle, which may be attributed to the prevention of further dissolution by suppression with PVK. The small Rct value and stable bulk resistance in the long life cycle processes of the SQD/PVK-B nanocomposites indicated that the dissolution of the polysulfide intermediates and the irreversible deposition of lithium sulfides at the anode were well restrained, which could simultaneously improve the specific capacity and the capacity retention during long-term cycling. This was proved by the results for cycling performance shown in Fig. 6d. At a current rate of 0.75 C, the SQD/PVK-B electrodes could still deliver a reversible capacity of 443.9 mA h g−1 after 500 cycles.
To better understand the relation between the structure and electrochemical performance of the SQD/PVK-B electrode, the surface morphology of this electrode before cycling and after 500 cycles at a rate of 0.75 C were characterized (Fig. 6e and f, respectively). No obvious change in morphology was observed after charging–discharging for over 500 cycles at 0.75 C compared with the fresh electrode. Fig. S6† shows more SEM images of the SQD/PVK electrode before cycling and after 500 cycles. These results strongly suggested that the void space could accommodate the volume expansion of the SQDs in the sulfur core during cycling. The PVK shell may prevent the loss of active sulfur, decrease the mechanical degradation of the electrode, and reversibly entrap the intermediate polysulfides.
The excellent electrochemical performance of the SQD/PVK electrode can be explained by its core–shell nanostructure. The complete wrapping of PVK over the sulfur core electrode may avoid the direct contact of sulfur with the electrolyte and prevent the polysulfide intermediates from dissolving in the electrolyte, thus minimizing the “shuttle effect”. The sulfur core consists of a large number of SQDs, which provide short electron diffusion pathways and more active sites, thus leading to higher utilization of the active sulfur and a higher capacity. More importantly, these uniformly dispersed SQDs in the sulfur core have a large inner void space, which plays an important part in accommodating the huge volume expansion during cycling, leading to excellent cycle stability. Further improvements in the specific capacity and rate capability may be obtained by combining the method developed here with other strategies, such as particle size control and pore confinement, and these studies are ongoing in our laboratory.
Conclusions
The core–shell SQD/PVK nanocomposites were prepared via a facile two-step dissolution–precipitation treatment in which a large number of SQDs (about 5 nm in size) with plenty of internal void spaces were encapsulated in a PVK shell. A superior electrochemical performance was obtained using this core–shell nanocomposite as the cathode material in Li/S batteries. The core–shell structure effectively wrapped the polysulfide intermediates and minimized the dissolution of the polysulfides in the electrolyte. The inner void space among the SQDs can accommodate the huge volume expansion during cycling, which leads to excellent reversibility and cyclability. The composites with 70.8 wt% sulfur showed the best electrochemical performance compared with the electrochemical results for composites with different sulfur contents.
