This designed mesoporous submicrostructure simultaneously promotes dye adsorption, light harvesting, and electron transport, leading to 28% improvement in the conversion efficiency compared to film-based SnO2.
The excellent characteristics of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) with short energy-payback time, simple assembly, and eco-friendly features make them potential options to utilize renewable energy. Since the remarkable breakthrough made by Grätzel, the basic sandwich structure consisting of a nanoparticle TiO2 photoanode, the I−/I3− electrolyte, and a Pt counter electrode has been adopted as the main concept to pursue high-efficiency DSSCs.1 Recently, a novel bilayer structural design composed of a light-scattering layer and a nano-sized transparent layer has become a promising way to effectively promote the device performance by enhancing the light absorption.2 Different shapes within the scattering layer, such as nanorods, hollow spheres, mirror-like structures, have been explored.3–9 However, a good scattering layer requires a submicron- or micron-scale size to effectively scatter the visible light, which sacrifices the surface area (less dye loading). Another challenge persisting with the typical TiO2 photoanode is the low electron mobility (0.1–1.0 cm2 V−1 S−1), which severely increases the electron recombination with submicron- or micron-scale thickness.10 Thus, the development of a versatile scattering layer with a multi-functional structure to satisfy all the needs (dye loading, light scattering, and electron transport) of a DSSC is becoming critical.
Recently, much attention has been focused on hollow sphere structures due to their exploitable interior spherical space and controlled structure for DSSC applications.11 For instance, the core–shell structure of Au surrounded by a TiO2 hollow sphere was devised to eliminate the photo-induced hole by the Au nanoparticles and suppress electron recombination.12 In addition, utilization of multi-shelled hollow spheres takes advantage of the multi-interior spheres to simultaneously enhance the dye loading and efficiency of light scattering.13 Unfortunately, these studies involving expensive elemental gold or template-based synthesis routes make them difficult to adapt for large-scale and low-cost manufacturing.
In this communication, we present a facile, template-free synthesis route for TiO2 hollow submicrospheres embedded with SnO2 nanobeans for use as a versatile scattering layer in DSSCs. The hollow spherical structure is designed to increase the light absorption by multiple light scattering. Unlike the Au@TiO2 core–shell microstructure, the low-cost and high mobility SnO2 (100–200 cm2 V−1 S−1) with long-term stability under ultraviolet radiation is decorated into TiO2 hollow submicrospheres for improving the electron transport. Furthermore, the embedding of SnO2 nanobeans in TiO2 hollow submicrospheres increases the dye loading by increasing the surface area.

Fig. 1 shows the 2-D schematic diagram of the formation of the SnO2-embedded TiO2 hollow submicrospheres (SnO2-embedded TiO2 HS). The template-free TiO2 hollow submicrospheres (TiO2 HS) were first fabricated by an inside-out Ostwald ripening process.14 Subsequently, the TiO2 HS were embedded with the SnO2 nanobeans to increase the surface area and porosity. Finally, an ultra thin TiO2 layer was deposited on the circumference of SnO2 nanobeans with a TiCl4 treatment to passivate the surface of the SnO2. Further experimental details can be found in the electronic ESI.†

The XRD analyses of the TiO2 HS before and after the embedding of SnO2 are shown in the top panel of Fig. 2. It can be seen that the XRD patterns of TiO2 HS without the embedding of SnO2 matches well with JCPDS 21-1272, indicating that our hollow submicrospheres synthesized by the Ostwald ripening process can produce a pure anatase phase of TiO2. The bottom panel in Fig. 2(a) shows the XRD of the TiO2 HS after the embedding of SnO2. The additional XRD peaks, other than those of the anatase TiO2 phase, can be identified with JCPDS 88-0287, revealing that the hydrothermal process can also facilitate the formation of a pure rutile-phase SnO2 on the anatase TiO2 HS.15,16 The Raman spectrum, as shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†), also confirms that the SnO2-embedded TiO2 HS structure is composed of the TiO2 anatase phase and rutile-phase SnO2.17–19

Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) line scan were used in Fig. 2(b) to characterize the distribution of Sn over the TiO2 HS after the embedding of SnO2. The STEM image indicates that the hollow spherical submicrostructure of TiO2 is preserved after the embedding of SnO2, suggesting that our template-free route for producing a hollow sphere is robust and comparable to the template-based hollow sphere routes. In addition, its surface is decorated with mesopores, leading to an increase in the surface area. The EDS line scan also indicates that the distribution of Ti has a strong concentration at both ends but a weak concentration at the center, which is consistent with a hollow sphere shape. Unlike the distribution of Ti, Sn shows roughly an even concentration, indicating that the embedding of SnO2 is accommodated well at the surface of TiO2 hollow spherical structure. Furthermore, the elemental mapping of STEM confirms that the embedding of SnO2 is uniformly dispersed among TiO2 HS as shown in Fig. 2(c).
The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images in Fig. 3(a)–(c) show a composite microstructure for the SnO2-embedded TiO2 HS. As seen in Fig. 3(a), the hollow sphere has a diameter of 600 nm with a wall thickness of 100 nm, which makes it suitable for light scattering in the wavelength range of 400–800 nm. In addition, Fig. 3(b) shows the morphology and structure of the SnO2 embedded over the hollow sphere possessing a nanobean shape of around 5 nm, which effectively decorates the surface of TiO2 HS, assembling a highly mesoporous microstructure. The high-resolution TEM in Fig. 3(c) reveals that both the embedded SnO2 nanobeans and TiO2 HS possess highly crystalline structures, which is consistent with the XRD analysis in Fig. 2(a). The surface area and pore-size distribution of the nanobean SnO2-embedded TiO2 HS were determined by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) measurement. Nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms with IUPAC (International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry) type H3 hysteresis loops are shown in Fig. 3(d), which verifies the existence of a mesoporous microstructure for both the TiO2 HS and the nanobean SnO2-embedded TiO2 HS. In addition, the pore-size distribution of TiO2 HS shows a maximum distribution around 12 nm, as compared with that of the nanobean SnO2-embedded TiO2 HS with a broad distribution from 7 to 17 nm; this suggests that the embedded SnO2 nanobeans were deposited into the pores at the TiO2 HS. Thus, the surface area of TiO2 HS (40 m2 g−1) is increased to 56 m2 g−1 after the embedding of SnO2, which enables the nanobean SnO2-embedded TiO2 HS to accommodate a high amount of dye loading.

The bi-layer film-stack structure composed of a series of scattering layers (SnO2, TiO2 HS, and SnO2-embedded TiO2 HS) atop a nano-sized TiO2 film followed by the TiCl4 treatment was used to investigate the amount of dye adsorption and light scattering. The cross-sectional SEM images of the bi-layer film-stack structure are shown in Fig. S4–S6 (ESI†). In Fig. 4(a), the SnO2-embedded TiO2 HS with high surface area exhibits a high amount of dye adsorption (8.03 × 10−8 mol cm−2) as compared with the poor dye adsorption of SnO2 (5.98 × 10−8 mol cm−2) and the lower surface area TiO2 HS (6.11 × 10−8 mol cm−2), suggesting that the possibility of the electron stimulated from the ground state to the excited state in the dye can be increased to improve the short-circuit-current density Jsc. Fig. 4(b) reveals the diffuse reflectance spectra of a series of SnO2, TiO2 HS, and SnO2-embedded TiO2 HS scattering layers atop the nano-sized TiO2 film. It can be seen that the SnO2-embedded TiO2 HS and TiO2 HS have higher diffuse reflectance than SnO2 to effectively scatter the incident light in the wavelength range of 400–800 nm. Fabrication of the DSSCs with a series of scattering layers was used to evaluate the power conversion efficiency with a solar simulator under AM 1.5 condition. The J–V characterization as shown in Fig. 4(c) reveals the conversion efficiency of SnO2-embedded TiO2 HS is 6.58% with Jsc = 13 mA cm−2, Voc = 754 mV, and FF = 67.21%, which is higher than those of TiO2 HS (6.01%) and SnO2 (5.11%). More photovoltaic and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) parameters are summarized in Table 1. The DSSC with a SnO2-embedded TiO2 HS scattering layer mainly exhibits an improvement in both Jsc and Voc, which enhances the conversion efficiency by around 28% as compared with a SnO2 scattering layer. The enhancement in Jsc can be attributed to the greater dye loading and the higher diffuse reflectance, as seen, respectively, in Fig. 4(a) and (b). In addition, the increase in Voc can be associated with the reduced recombination due to the embedding of SnO2 nanobeans on the TiO2 HS.

To further investigate the charge-transfer process and electron transport, EIS data were collected at each of their own open-circuit voltage with an AC amplitude of 10 mV in the frequency range from 0.1 Hz to 1 MHz in the dark. Fig. 4(d) shows the Nyquist impedance spectra of the cells with a series of scattering layers (SnO2, TiO2 HS, and SnO2-embedded TiO2 HS) atop the nano-sized TiO2 film. The equivalent circuit diagram of the cell is shown in Fig. S8 (ESI†). As known, the semicircle in the middle frequency range reflects the charge recombination, which is attributed to the charge-transfer resistance at the interfaces of metal oxide/dye/electrolyte and the electron transport in the photoanode of the metal oxide.20 A larger semicircle for the cell using the scattering layer of SnO2-embedded TiO2 HS (42.01 Ω cm2) than those for TiO2 HS (34.04 Ω cm2) and SnO2 (25.17 Ω cm2) reveals a lower electron recombination, which agrees well with the high Voc obtained with SnO2-embedded TiO2 HS. Besides, since the SnO2-embedded TiO2 HS and TiO2 HS after the treatment with TiCl4 can be expected to have similar charge-transfer resistances at the interfaces, the larger semicircle indicates that the higher recombination resistance (lower recombination) can be attributed mainly to the fast electron transport in the photoanode of the metal oxide. Thus, the comparative study of SnO2-embedded TiO2 HS and TiO2 HS suggests that the low electron recombination in SnO2-embedded TiO2 HS can be mainly attributed to the nanobeans of SnO2 embedded in TiO2 HS due to the improvement in electron transport by the high mobility of SnO2 in the metal-oxide photoanode. Furthermore, the Bode plot and open-circuit voltage decay (OCVD) measurement, as shown in Fig. S9 and S10 (ESI†), also found that TiO2 HS after the embedding of SnO2 has lower recombination.
In conclusion, a designed microstructure of template-free TiO2 hollow submicrospheres embedded with SnO2 nanobeans has been developed for use as a versatile scattering layer in DSSCs. In addition to the enhanced light scattering by submicro-scale TiO2 hollow spheres, the embedding of SnO2 nanobeans in the hollow sphere has been found to effectively increase the surface area, leading to an improvement in the dye loading. A 28% improvement in the conversion efficiency could be achieved by adopting this designed structure as a scattering layer to provide a promising combination of improvement in dye adsorption, light harvesting, and electron transport.
