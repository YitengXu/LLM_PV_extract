    , Accepted 3rd July 2012First published on 3rd July 2012AbstractCombining semiconductor photocatalysts with carbon nanostructures has been extensively investigated due to their enhanced photochemical conversion activity. While many nanocomposite synthesis methods have been reported, the emerging use of photocatalytic reactions in synthesizing these carbon-based semiconductor composites and even pure carbon nanomaterials is increasingly capturing the attention of the research community. Being categorized under photocatalysis, these carbon-based nanomaterials are designed by either utilizing the conduction band electron or valence band hole of a photocatalyst. This perspective surveys the literature, discusses the principle of the method and highlights the recent progress in the development of this synthetic method. Ongoing challenges and new possible solutions encountered in this research area are outlined.

Broader context
Photocatalysis is a solar energy conversion process, extensively investigated for both environmental remediation (airborne and water treatment) and energy generation (H2 production). Novel semiconductor photocatalysts have been developed and studied for many decades. Among the efforts to improve semiconductor photocatalysts, carbon modification appears to be a promising method to boost performance for many reasons: it facilitates improved electron transport, facilitates increased light absorption, creates a substrate localization effect, and improves photocatalyst dispersion. There are many review articles summarizing the utilizations of carbon-based nanomaterials in photocatalysis. However, thus far no review article describes “making” carbon-based nanomaterials by photocatalysis. The principle of photocatalytic synthesis of carbon-based materials involves a delicate understanding of the redox abilities of a photocatalyst, and using this ability to trigger the formation of carbon or carbon precursors. It has emerged as a useful alternative technique in preparing carbon-based materials and is certainly a new and promising application of photocatalysis in materials synthesis. This perspective provides an overview of the principle and recent progress in “making” carbon-based materials from solar energy and “using” the derived materials for solar energy and other applications. The strategies for tailoring the properties of carbon materials by modulating the valence and conduction bands of a photocatalyst are summarized.

Introduction of semiconductor photocatalysts
Driven by the great potential in photochemical conversion, photocatalysis, be it a homogeneous1–3 or heterogeneous system,4–6 has attracted immense interest over recent decades and has traditionally been applied to decompose organic and inorganic pollutants, either in liquid or gas phase.5,7 Over time, the broader applications found in heterogeneous photocatalysis, which is also known as semiconductor photocatalysis, have made it more appealing than its homogeneous counterpart. Abundance, non-toxic in general, biologically and chemically stable, capable of retrieval and extended use without substantial loss of activity, no additive of transition metal complexes required in aqueous phase pollutant management, capable of contaminant control in air under ambient conditions, and controllability of redox power through materials engineering are often recognized as the rubric of semiconductor photocatalysis. Interest in understanding and developing semiconductor photocatalysts was geared by Fujishima and Honda's observation8 in 1972 that simultaneous oxidation and reduction of water into O2 and H2 occur upon UV illumination of a TiO2 electrode in aide of a small electrochemical bias. This significant discovery, to a great extent, prompted and directed extensive research on the production of hydrogen from water as an alternate source of clean energy using sunlight.9–20
Although dominance of the applications of semiconductor photocatalysts in hydrogen production and environmental remediation is indisputable due to the future energy insecurity and the increasingly stringent environmental concerns, many other useful reactions could also be induced by carefully designed redox reactions originating from the band gap excitation of a variety of photo-active semiconductors.4 Antimicrobial functions21–26 for health care product development, fine organic synthesis27–31 for delicate chemical and pharmaceutical industries, and functional materials preparation32–34 for catalysis and sensors are among the emerging areas involving photocatalytic redox reactions that diversify the research direction in this field.
It is the primary photochemical processes occurring at the surface of an illuminated semiconductor that form the basis for all the applications mentioned above. A semiconductor photocatalyst has two series of energetically closely spaced energy levels that form the valence and conduction bands. The magnitude of the difference between the electrons-populated valence band and the almost vacant conduction band is termed the energy band gap of a semiconductor. Band gap energy governs the wavelength of light required to excite the semiconductor upon illumination. When subjected to band gap excitation through illumination with light of energy greater than the band gap, the semiconductor undergoes charge separation in which an electron is promoted from the valence band to the conduction band, leaving an electronic vacancy termed a “hole” at the valence band edge. Ideally, these excited charges should initiate further interfacial electron transfer or chemical reactions to its adsorbate, reactant, or the surface-bound hydroxyl group. However, since most of the semiconductor photocatalysts are made into nano-to-submicron size which introduces a high density of grain boundaries, coupled with the insufficient electron–hole pair lifetime and electron diffusion length, only a fraction (∼5%) of these charges can be accessed for redox reactions at the interface before they undergo recombination.35
Comprehensive studies using TiO2 and other semiconductor photocatalysts clearly indicated the necessity to retain the charge separation states in achieving higher photoconversion efficiencies. Efforts have been made to improve the photocatalytic performances of a semiconductor photocatalyst by (i) extending the photoresponse of the UV-active semiconductor (particularly TiO2) into the visible region through band gap tuning or introduction of photosensitizers, (ii) suppressing excited electron–hole recombination, and (iii) promoting the forward reaction through localizing the reactants adjacent to the active sites. The strategies include coupling with a narrow band gap semiconductor,36–45 metallic and non-metallic doping,46–61 dye-sensitization ,62–69 depositing noble metal nanoparticles70–79 and hybridized structure with carbonaceous materials.80–90
Metal nanoparticles (e.g. Pt, Pd, and Au) loaded onto the surface of a semiconductor act as a reservoir for excited electrons, thus preventing them from recombining with holes and promoting an interfacial charge-transfer. In contrast, doping with metal (e.g. Fe3+, Ru4+, Mo6+, Cr3+, Sb5+ and V4+) or non-metal (e.g. N, F and S) aims at extending the photoresponse towards lower energy excitation by introducing impurity levels between the conduction and valence bands of the parent photocatalyst. Introduction of dyes and narrow band gap semiconductors has a similar purpose to doping. Dyes and narrow band gap semiconductors such as CdS, CdSe, PbS, and Bi2S3 can harvest visible light. Owing to the favorable energy structures, excited electrons from dyes and narrow band gap photocatalysts can be transferred to the large band gap photocatalysts such as TiO2. The mechanism and effectiveness of these strategies have been amply reviewed and updated elsewhere.91,92
Emerging role of carbonaceous materials in semiconductor photocatalysis
Currently, significant attention is being given towards the use of carbonaceous materials to enhance the photocatalytic activities of semiconductor photocatalysis. Incorporating carbon nanostructures in composites of photocatalysts not only suppresses charge recombination93 and facilitates a hydrophobic microenvironment for localization of concentrated reactant neighbouring the active sites,94 recent investigations have also indicated that the graphitic carbon, when it forms an effective complex interface with TiO2, can act as a sensitizer95,96 or as impurity energy levels through the formation of Ti–O–C bonds97,98 to extend the light absorption region. Thus, carbonaceous materials show great potential in fulfilling all three strategies in improving photocatalytic activities as mentioned in the previous section.
Xu et al. reported a 90% enhancement in the complete photocatalytic mineralization of gas phase benzene using TiO2 nanotubes hydrothermally treated with carbon nanotubes.99 They also reported selective oxidation of a series of aromatic alcohols to their corresponding aldehydes in the liquid phase using CdS nanoparticles loaded on graphene sheets via the solvothermal method.100 Akhavan and co-workers intensively investigated the antimicrobial activities of various graphitic carbons incorporating TiO2 and ZnO.101–104 They reported an enhancement in the photocatalytic killing of E. coli bacteria by a factor of 7.5 in an aqueous solution under sunlight.103 Zhu and colleagues extended the TiO2's response into the visible range by coating thin layers of graphite-like carbon (∼1 nm) on TiO2 nanoparticles.105 They proposed that the electron coupling, resulting from the d–π interaction (d-orbital from the conduction band of TiO2 and π states of graphite-like carbon), contributed to the extension of light absorption. Our group has shown that graphitic carbon can shuttle electrons between two photocatalysts with complementary band structures to complete an electron cycle for Z-scheme water splitting.106 Many research groups reported on the constructive effect, attributed to the presence of carbonaceous materials, in the photocatalytic hydrogen production (with or without sacrificial reagents)107–111 and photodegradation of organic pollutants.112–116 In addition, a significant amount of work investigating the effect of carbon nanomaterials has used decoloration of organic dye as the model photocatalytic reactions.117–126 While the assessment of activity is generally convenient, the experiments need to be performed in a scientifically proven manner to avoid misinterpretation of the results.127
Literatures on the investigation of the roles of carbon, the chemical and physical synthetic methods of carbon-semiconductor photocatalysts, and their photochemical activities have been reviewed and updated regularly attributed to the rapid growth and enhanced interest in these areas:128–132 Faria and Wang recently provided a review on carbon materials in photocatalysis;130 Wu and colleagues summarized the application of carbon materials in photovoltaic solar cells;131 Yu and Jaroniec's review article focussed on the synthesis of graphene-based semiconductor photocatalysts.132 While “utilizing” carbonaceous materials in photocatalysis and its beneficial effects have been thoroughly documented in the literature, there is currently no review article describing “making” carbon or carbon-based materials by photocatalysis.
Strategies have been formulated to fabricate carbon and carbon-based nanocomposites by photocatalysis.34,103,106,110,116,133–152 It involves a delicate understanding in the use of the redox abilities of a photocatalyst to trigger the formation of carbon nanostructures or carbon precursors from the reactions. It has now emerged as a useful alternative technique to prepare carbon-based nanomaterials by providing opportunities to fine tune the properties of the product, including their electronic conductivity and storage capacity, hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity of the composites, morphology and porosity. All these parameters are of importance for many applications. Interestingly, a large portion of these carbon nanostructures and carbon-based nanomaterials derived from photocatalytic reactions found uses in light energy-related applications such as in photocatalytic organic degradation, water splitting for hydrogen production, photovoltaic and photoelectrochemical cells, and antibacterial applications. Others demonstrated excellent performances in thermal catalysis. Although this is a fast growing research field, it has received less coverage in recent reviews than is warranted.
This perspective critically examines the principles of the photocatalytic approach in synthesizing pure carbon and carbon-based composites as it emerges as a crucial application of photocatalysts beside its traditional functions. The fundamental hypotheses can be divided into two categories: the utilization of (i) conduction or (ii) valance band of the semiconductor photocatalysts, in which the properties of the resulting carbon-based nanomaterials are highly dependent on the potential of each band. The products derived from these methods, their uniqueness in characteristics and applications are discussed. Promises and future challenges of the method and the synthesized carbon-based nanocomposites are outlined at the end of the article.
Carbon-based nanomaterials derived from photocatalytic reactions
Before addressing the carbon-based semiconductor obtained via a photocatalytic route, the widely employed generic methods of these materials are briefly summarized in Table 1. Note that Table 1 is not a complete reference list of all reported carbon nanostructures, but is rather an example of carbons coupled with different semiconductors derived from conventional methods. It is apparent that the most commonly studied semiconductors coupled with carbon nanostructures are TiO2, ZnO and CdS, in which TiO2 has become the benchmark photocatalyst, while CdS receives great attention because of its spectral response to wavelengths of the solar spectrum. Carbonaceous materials can be combined with a semiconductor as nanocomposites in several ways. Sol–gel, hydrothermal and solvothermal processes are the most popular methods. Further to the methods listed in Table 1, simple mechanical mixing of semiconductors and carbon, be it carbon nanotubes, activated carbon or graphene, has been performed in many studies for comparison. Limited by the weak interaction, with no formation of chemical bonds between the two components, mechanically mixed composites usually demonstrate a lower level of activity enhancement or even an inferior photocatalytic performance. Note that carbon-doped semiconductor photocatalysts will not be covered in this perspective because its dopant level is usually in a few atomic percentages and therefore can hardly be recognized as a “carbon-based” material. The mechanisms of carbon dopant enhancement are not established although a general band gap narrowing effect is agreed by the research community. The controversies over carbon dopants are centered at the origin of the wavelength absorption extension, in which both theoretical and experimental researchers still vigorously debate over the role of carbon in narrowing down the band gap through either broadening of the valence band, formation of localized C 2p midgap levels, or the localized dopant levels near the conduction and valence bands. Readers are recommended to refer to recent reviews by Nie185 and Serpone186 on the subject of doping of semiconductor photocatalysts.

Carbon-based composites can be prepared using a photocatalytic reaction, based on either the utilization of excited electrons from the conduction band or holes from the valence band of the photocatalyst. Principles of each synthetic method are discussed in two separate sections.
Utilization of conduction band electrons – photocatalytic reduction

Mechanism. 
A photocatalyst is chemically productive only when the excited electron–hole pair is consumed simultaneously before the recombination which occurs within a fraction of a nanosecond. Depending on the targeted reaction, suppression of the recombination can be accomplished by trapping either the electrons or the holes by a chemical component, in which this chemical component is commonly known as a scavenger (be it sacrificial or not). One of the most common uses of the conduction band electron is the photodeposition of noble metals such as Pt, Pd or Ir on semiconductor nanoclusters in some organic or alcohol media. Organic species, like triethylamine, hydroquinone and simple alcohols, are used to trap the holes so that the conduction band electron can be transferred to metal ions and reduce them into metal nanoparticles.
Analogous to the photodeposition of a noble metal, a conduction band electron from a photocatalyst could also be transferred to a carbon precursor if the reduction potential of the carbon precursor is lower than that of the conduction band energy in the presence of a hole scavenger (Fig. 1). Compared with CdS, CdTe and SrTiO3, TiO2 is a relatively mild reductant with a conduction band at around −0.5 V versus NHE at pH 7. However, TiO2 has demonstrated its ability of injecting excited electrons to fullerenes, carbon nanotubes and other graphitic carbon nanostructures.5,187,188 The interaction between the excited photocatalysts and the carbon nanostructures has triggered massive research interest because of the involvement of energy and electron transfer. The charge transfer from excited TiO2 to single wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) was probed by measuring the flat band potentials of the bare TiO2 and TiO2–SWCNT composite. Because TiO2 is an n-type semiconductor, the flat band potential could be used to study the comparative Fermi level of the composite. When a SWCNT is coupled with TiO2, a positive shift in the flat band potential from −0.86 to −0.79 V versus SCE in 1 M KOH was recorded.187 As the conduction band of TiO2 is expected to be more negative than that of the SWCNT, a charge equilibration between the two components resulted in the positive shift in the Fermi level and indicated the interplay between the excited photocatalyst and the carbon nanostructures.

The original weak chemical interaction between the semiconductor photocatalyst and the pristine carbon, such as pure SWCNT and graphene, can be overcome by introducing functional groups (particularly oxygen functional groups) to the carbon nanostructure before the excited-states interaction. In the area of pure carbon research, treating graphitic carbon nanostructures in strong inorganic acid to afford hydrophilicity has become a common procedure to improve the dispersion in various media including in an aqueous solution. Here, in addition to the dispersibility improvement, the introduction of a carboxylic acid group has another critical role – it provides the basis of the chemical interaction with the surface hydroxyl groups from TiO2. Bignozzi et al. have investigated thoroughly the strong interaction between surface hydroxyls of various metal oxides and carboxylic acid groups.189,190 Taking one step forward, Kamat demonstrated that graphene oxide functionalized with a carboxylic group, which is obtained by chemical oxidation of graphite, can form effective bindings to TiO2 (ref. 133) and ZnO140 to construct a stable colloidal suspension in ethanol. Upon UV illumination of the suspension in an inert atmosphere, the holes are instantly consumed by ethanol to form ethoxy radicals, which will undergo further degradation. Since the hole trapping process occurs in an efficient manner, the electrons do not recombine but are accumulated within the photocatalysts and subsequently transferred to the adjacent graphene oxide to reduce certain oxygen functional groups, such as hydroxyl and epoxy groups. A study by Kamat and our group has also demonstrated the great potential of this method to develop efficient photocatalyst composites and photoelectrochemical cells.116 Our group has further proved the feasibility of this charge transfer using semiconductor photocatalysts with an even lower conduction band energy (weaker reducing ability) that is responsive in visible light (e.g. WO3 and BiVO4).134,135 As depicted in Fig. 1, the principle flow of charges in the synthesis is expressed in the reactions below: Photocatalyst + hν → Photocatalyst(h + e−)(1) Photocatalyst(h + e−) + organic scavenger → Photocatalyst(e−) + ˙organic scavenger radical + H+(2) Photocatalyst(e−) + graphene oxide (GO) → Photocatalyst + reduced graphene oxide (RGO)(3)
The transfer of conduction band electrons to the graphene oxide as suggested above is not just a thermodynamic assumption; it has been probed using a spectroscopy method. Given that the electrons are temporarily trapped inside a photocatalyst, TiO2 for instance, it is the provisionally generated Ti3+ species which give an absorption wavelength at around 650 nm. Knowing the molar absorbance of these species,191 the number of electrons transferred from TiO2 to graphene oxide can be calculated by measuring the absorbance changes when graphene oxide is titrated into the Ti3+ solution under an inert atmosphere. Experiments should be conducted in an air-sealed condition as the conduction band of TiO2 is nearly isoenergetic with the reduction potential of O2. It may result in an overestimation of TiO2-to-graphene oxide charge transfer in the presence of air.


Characteristics and applications. 
In this photocatalytic method, the strategies generally relied upon (i) the hole trapping process to provide sufficient time for the conduction band electron to transfer to the graphene oxide, and (ii) the electron transfer driving force governed by the conduction band position. Therefore, manipulation with (i) and (ii) provides immense opportunities in modulating the properties of the resultant carbon and carbon-based materials.
Because of the rapidness of the charge recombination in photocatalysts, the rate of the interfacial hole trapping must also be rapid if an efficient conversion of the absorbed light energy to the chemically stored redox equivalent is to be achieved. Selection of hole scavengers with different oxidation potentials allows one to control the thermodynamics of the electron transfer from the excited photocatalyst to the carbon. We have investigated carefully the effects of hole scavengers on the reduction degree of graphene oxide accompanied with the exciting ability of modulating its chemical functional groups and electronic behavior. We have also demonstrated that using photocatalysts with different reducing ability, as determined by the conduction band energy, can be used to control the dispersibility of the resultant composites in an aqueous solution by manipulating the hydrophilicity of the carbon. This strategy is of extreme significance in developing carbon-based photocatalysts in overall water splitting using sunlight. Unlike hydrogen generation from sacrificial agents (typically alcohols) where carbon-based materials have reasonably good dispersion, overall water splitting using water as both electron and hole scavengers has difficulty in mixing the carbon component with photocatalysts in an aqueous solution due to its hydrophobicity. Based on a photocatalytic reduction method choosing BiVO4 as the mildly reducing photocatalyst, our group has shown that it is possible to achieve a hydrophilic graphitic carbon-based photocatalyst, while maintaining the electronic conductance of the carbon to shuttle electrons between the two photocatalysts in a Z-scheme system.106 The turnover number (TON) calculated as the number of moles of reactive electrons per mole of carbon was found to be 3.2, which is a comparable value with the existing liquid phase Fe3+/Fe2+ redox couples (TON = 2). This is the first report of the use of a solid-state electron mediator to bridge two different photocatalysts. The principle of this Z-scheme is illustrated in Fig. 2a. The tailor-made carbon can shuttle electrons from the conduction band of BiVO4 to the valence band of Ru/SrTiO3:Rh. The working scheme of this Z-scheme water splitting system has a complementary effect with the proposed directional migration of excited electrons from a photocatalyst to a secondary component through the graphitic carbon, as proposed by Kamat (Fig. 2b).142 It has been shown that Pt nanoparticles anchored on the carbon mat using the electrons injected from TiO2. These findings are believed to be useful in water splitting and the development of chemical/biological sensors.

This photocatalytic synthesis method has now been taken up by many research groups to develop carbon-based composites for various energy applications. Akhavan and Ghaderi103 prepared TiO2–graphene for light-induced antibacterial reaction; Mukherji et al.110 prepared N-doped Sr2Ta2O7–graphene for hydrogen production from methanol; Lightcap and Kamat143 developed CdSe–graphene quantum dot solar cells. Besides, Choi and co-workers reported a similar strategy in an homogeneous photocatalytic system using phosphotungstate as the homogeneous photocatalyst under UV illumination.151
The photocatalytic synthetic method introduces intimate interaction between carbon and metal oxide photocatalysts. This, most of the time, results in the formation of carbon composite materials rather than pure carbon. Recently, Lee and co-workers reported on the preparation of water dispersible pure carbon using TiO2 photocatalytic reduction synthesis.152 Prior to this, all investigations reported the formation of composite materials such as metal oxide/carbon, metal oxide/carbon/metal oxide, metal oxide/carbon/metal and metal/carbon. They developed a two-step centrifugation process to separate TiO2 nanoparticles from graphitic carbon and reported >90% carbon recovery. This opens up an attractive and environmentally friendly alternative method to produce pristine carbon; as current graphitic carbon synthesis usually involves nasty chemicals such as hydrazine.192
Besides, many studies have been reported using the photodegradation of organic dyes as the model reaction using carbon-based photocatalysts. As dyes may undergo self-excitation, photolysis or themselves sensitize the photocatalysts in visible light, interpretation of the results without the consideration of these above mechanisms may not reflect the accurate photocatalytic activities of the composite materials. Furthermore, the term photodegradation usually refers to complete oxidative mineralization, where decoloration of dyes is actually the annihilation of its chromophore. Thus, selecting an illumination wavelength that does not excite the dyes or use other nonphotoexcited organic compounds is essential in probing activities of these composites.
As discussed, the latest trend in using photocatalytic synthesis has evolved rapidly from preparing simple metal oxide-graphitic carbon to functionalized nanomaterials that are more versatile. Consequently, it is not surprising that growth in this research direction will continue for years as new knowledge and applications are developed.

Utilization of valence band holes – photocatalytic oxidative reaction

Mechanism. 
Photooxidation of organic substrates initiated by the photogenerated holes, either through the direct hole mediation or the surface-bound hydroxyl radicals, is by far the most investigated reaction class of semiconductor photocatalysis. This is likely due to the considerably large oxidizing ability of the photocatalyst's valence band. The most investigated TiO2 photocatalyst possesses valence band energy of around +2.7 V versus NHE at pH 7, which can oxidize most of the simple organic molecules, depending on the reaction conditions. When the photogenerated hole reaches the surface of the semiconductor, it may react directly with the adsorbed substrate through an interfacial electron transfer from the adsorbate to the hole, or it may react with the surface hydroxyl group to form the surface-bound OH˙ radical. Numerous studies have investigated the competing roles between the surface-bound OH˙ radicals and the holes in photocatalytic reactions.193–195 For instance, phenol oxidation is dominated by OH˙ attack in the dilute aqueous solution but was initiated by direct hole oxidation under concentrated conditions, as suggested by Domenech.193 As mentioned in the previous section, oxygen serves as an efficient electron scavenger in the TiO2 system because of its nearly isoenergetic potential with the conduction band. The formed superoxide O2− species are highly active oxygenation agents and assist in the photodegradation of organic substrates. Therefore, the presence of oxygen is crucial in photocatalytic degradation of organics, especially when a complete mineralization is the ultimate goal. However, photocatalytic oxidative polymerization usually proceeds in the absence of oxygen since it arrests the propagation of monomer radicals. Oxygen acts as an inhibitor or retarder of polymerization.
Our group has developed hollow carbon spheres encapsulating Pt nanoparticles based on a photocatalytic oxidative polymerization of phenol on the surface of platinized TiO2 nanoparticles.34,137–139 As depicted in Fig. 3, when a suspension containing TiO2 nanoparticles, H2PtCl6, and phenol as the monomer was photoirradiated in an air-free reactor with a UV-light source, simultaneous photoreduction of Pt(IV) ions by the conduction band electrons and photooxidative polymerization of phenol initiated by the holes occur on the surface of TiO2. Subsequent carbonization of the phenolic polymer layer, followed by the removal of TiO2 core particles, yielded the hollow carbon–Pt nanocomposites. The role of TiO2 nanoparticles is not only to initiate the polymerization of phenol, but also to serve as the physical template for the derived hollow nanocomposites, in which the hollow structure of carbon has found great potential uses in catalysis, Li-ion batteries and fuel cells.196–202 This principle of fabricating carbon spheres based on photocatalytic reaction was also extended by our group using ZnO nanoparticles and other aromatic monomers such as hydroquinone, biphenol and phenoxyphenol.

Fig. 4 shows the proposed reaction pathways for oxidation of phenol in the TiO2 photocatalytic system in an argon atmosphere. The basic idea is that the initiation of phenol polymerization involves a surface reaction of adsorbed phenol to form phenoxy radicals, which can be further oxidized to dihydroxylic benzenes or to produce dimeric compounds. This pathway is proven by the detection of hydroquinone, resorcinol, biphenol and phenoxy phenol in the reaction suspension after brief illumination. As these coupled phenol units have a lower oxidation potential than phenol,203 they are more readily oxidized to radicals. Chain propagation results when fresh phenol diffuses to the surface and reacts with the monomer, dimer or oligomer radicals. As the hydrophobicity of the polymer increases with chain propagation, adsorption of the phenolic polymer on TiO2 is favored in the aqueous solution as water is a poor solvent for the phenolic polymer. Besides, photocatalytic oxidative polymerization of other monomers using semiconductor has also been documented. Morris and co-workers reported polymerization of methyl methacrylates (MMA) in an alcohol solution initiated by photoexcited ZnO nanoparticles. Although their proposed reaction mechanism is different from ours because of the presence of an alcohol medium, the critical role of photogenerated holes is demonstrated:204 ZnO + hν → h+ + e−(4) h+ + RHOH → ROH˙ + H+(5) Mads + ROH˙ → HM˙ads + RO(6) HM˙ads + nM → HM˙n,ads(7) HM˙n,ads + e− + H+ → HMnHads(8)where Mads, HM˙ads, HM˙n,ads and HMnHads correspond to adsorbed MMA molecule, adsorbed MMA radical, adsorbed oligomer/polymer radical, and adsorbed polymer chain, respectively. Similar photocatalytic polymerization of MMA using CdS quantum dots has also been reported.205 In these two examples, the ZnO and CdS particles are removed by chemical etching methods after the photocatalytic polymerization process. Table 2 lists many types of monomers that can be polymerized through either the heterogeneous or homogeneous photocatalytic reaction. However, the precise mechanism for the reactions is yet to be revealed.

Carbon-based materials derived from polymers have made considerable progress in recent years, especially in the development of molecular sieves, catalyst supports and adsorbents for the storage of natural gas. Compared with the thermal method, photocatalytic polymerization is initiated with light and terminated upon light off. Furthermore, the molecular weight and density of the polymer can be varied through the selection of monomer and irradiation conditions. Carbonization of the carefully designed polymer provides opportunities in controlling the pore size, pore volume and bulk density of the resultant carbon, which are important characteristics in the above-mentioned applications.


Characteristics and applications. 
Direct observation of polymeric growth on TiO2 and deposition of a noble metal (Pt) through the photocatalytic process can provide insight into the reaction kinetics and mechanism, which is useful for understanding the properties of the thus derived carbon-based nanocomposites. Fig. 5 maps the evolution of morphological changes of TiO2 as the deposition of Pt and polymerization progresses over time. At 15 min illumination, Pt particles with sizes of 2–3 nm were clearly seen as bright dots on the plain TiO2 surface but no formation of polymer was observed. The presence of phenolic polymer started to appear on the TiO2 surface as some irregular components located adjacent to the Pt metals after 30 min illumination.139 Complete coverage of TiO2 particles with a layer of phenolic polymer was achieved after one hour illumination with the morphology remaining essentially the same after a prolonged 5 h irradiation. Pt nanoparticles were unseen as they were located beneath the polymer but their presence can be observed in the inset TEM image. The more rapid deposition of Pt nanoparticles on TiO2 than that of the polymer explains the final structure of the sample, i.e. the encapsulation of Pt nanoparticles inside the carbon capsule. This is informative in designing the metal–carbon composite. Post-grafting of the metal component is not necessary and externally located metal can be prevented as well.

Fig. 6a shows the matrix of platinized TiO2 nanoparticles wrapped by a thin layer of carbon. Zhu et al. demonstrated that TiO2 nanoparticles covered by a 1–2 nm thick carbon shell, similar to Fig. 6a, exhibited two-fold enhancement in photodecomposing the gas phase formaldehyde than bare TiO2 owing to the higher migration of photogenerated electrons and the extension of light absorption.105 Furthermore, Inagaki and co-workers found the suppression of TiO2 phase transformation from anatase to rutile when the anatase was coated with a thin layer of carbon. The transformation from anatase to rutile usually takes place at ∼600 °C, but it was suppressed up to 800 °C with a thin layer carbon coating.215

Upon removal of the TiO2 component as shown in Fig. 6a, the tomogram of the hollow carbon-based Pt composite obtained through a special 3D TEM technique clearly indicates the location of Pt nanoparticles being embedded inside the porous carbon shell (Fig. 6b).138 When TiO2 is employed as both the photocatalyst and the template, it can be dissolved and removed by a hydrofluoric acid (HF) treatment under ambient temperature. If ZnO is used instead of TiO2, glacial acetic acid or hydrochloric acid (HCl) could be used to dissolve the ZnO nanoparticles. Previously reported carbon-based Pt composites usually have the Pt nanoparticles deposited on top of the carbon support, located in between carbon rods, and encapsulated in hollow carbon spheres as rattle type particles. Using this photocatalytic method, a new and unique structure of carbon-based Pt composites was developed. Because of the embedment structure, the Pt nanoparticles are physically immobilized and separated from each other by the carbon matrix. It significantly suppressed the sintering behavior of Pt nanoparticles at high temperatures up to 800 °C, where sintering is a common problem in carbon-supported metal catalysts. This carbon-based Pt composite showed remarkable stability and reusability in catalytic hydrogenation of olefins and oxidation of alcohols with minimum loss of activity in subsequent runs.
Moreover, photocatalytic polymerization is able to control the pack density and porosity of the resultant carbon. As the phenolic polymer completely covers the surface of TiO2, free phenol is subsequently diffused through the initially loosely packed polymer to reach the accessible surface sites of TiO2. This densifies the polymer layer over time. Because of the gradual densification during the photocatalytic reaction, penetration of fresh phenol into the polymer layer was gradually diminished. Carbonization of the polymer with various degrees of packing density allows the production of carbon with different porosities, having a great influence on the thermal catalytic activity when it is used as the catalyst support. Our group has demonstrated the ability to tune the surface area of the carbon composites ranging from 690 to a remarkably high 1390 m2 g−1 by controlling the packing density of the polymer on TiO2.137 Micropore volume of the carbon materials can also be modulated from 0.23 to 0.43 cm3 g−1. Note that use of monomers other than phenol may lead to a different pathway of polymeric growth on TiO2, which also provides immense possibilities in controlling the carbon thickness, pore size distribution and porosity of the resultant carbon.

Outlook: challenges and conclusions
Photocatalysis can be applied as an alternative synthetic route for pure carbon and carbon-based composites by either utilizing (i) conduction band electrons through a photocatalytic reduction of carbon precursors, or (ii) valence band holes via a photooxidative polymerization of carbon precursors. At this stage, both approaches have seen great success in the TiO2 photocatalystic system but are achieved only to a limited extent in some other semiconductor photocatalysts. This is most probably because of the popularity of TiO2 in photocatalysis that resulted in a large number of investigations, however, the mismatched band energy alignment between the photocatalysts and carbon precursors may also contribute to the limited studies performed using semiconductor photocatalysts other than TiO2.
Observation of enhancement in photocatalytic, photoelectrochemical, antibacterial, H2-producing and many other light energy related reactions places nanocarbon-semiconductor composites as promising real world application materials. Yet, the primary challenge is to fully understand the underlying mechanism of the activities improvement. Generally accepted factors contributing to the enhanced activity include (i) suppression of electron–hole recombination in semiconductors by providing a low resistant pathway for electron shuttle, (ii) extension of excitation wavelength through the formation of chemical bonding between the semiconductor and carbon, which is analogous to the doping effect or sensitization, (iii) localization of the concentrated organic substrate adjacent to active sites in the photocatalyst by introducing hydrophobicity to the composite, and (iv) the improved dispersion of semiconductor nanoparticles on carbon supports that enable a larger amount of exposed active sites for reactions. Although all these factors are supported by theoretical or experimental evidence, the contribution weight of each single factor is not clear. The fundamental understanding of each factor in a more quantitative way will shed light on the research strategies in the future. Future progress will also be dependent on the development of photocatalysts with functionalized surfaces and modulation of the band potential, which will empower the establishment of intimate yet greater contact between the two components. It will also facilitate control over the electronic properties of the carbon through controlled restoration of conjugated sp2 carbon.
Owing to the high oxidation potential of the photogenerated holes (especially from the excited TiO2), various oxidative reactions can take place on the surface of the photocatalyst, and this makes it challenging in determining the exact mechanism involved in the oxidative polymerization of a carbon precursor. A limited understanding of the exact mechanistic pathway for photocatalytic oxidative polymerization is the current bottleneck in producing carbon with a wider range of porosity (be it surface area, pore type, micro/mesopore volume and pore size distribution). Although the surface area of the resultant carbon can be facilely tuned between 700 and 1400 m2 g−1 using current strategies, modulation of the micro/mesopore volume with greater flexibility is restricted by the nature of the synthesized polymer. If carbon-semiconductors synthesis by photocatalytic polymerization is to progress into a mature field of research, further understanding of the mechanism is crucial in determining the structure of the polymer prior to carbonization. Since the photocatalytic polymerization reaction is also a template-based process, the development of semiconductors with engineered structures like spheres, rods, and ordered porous matrices would result in carbon with different morphologies. In addition to investigating the chemical and physical properties of the carbon, mechanical strength of these hollow materials should also be understood as carbon materials are often used in strength reinforcement materials.
In summary, fabricating pure carbon and carbon-based composites by photocatalysis, either based on photocatalytic reduction or oxidation, is a promising new application of photocatalysis in materials synthesis. This perspective is the first to focus on the principle and the development of photocatalysis in carbon-based nanomaterials synthesis. The growth in this area will continue to be application-driven, but the challenge to further development lies in the understanding of the fundamental processes in parallel with a better control of the synthesis method.

Broader context
Photocatalysis is a solar energy conversion process, extensively investigated for both environmental remediation (airborne and water treatment) and energy generation (H2 production). Novel semiconductor photocatalysts have been developed and studied for many decades. Among the efforts to improve semiconductor photocatalysts, carbon modification appears to be a promising method to boost performance for many reasons: it facilitates improved electron transport, facilitates increased light absorption, creates a substrate localization effect, and improves photocatalyst dispersion. There are many review articles summarizing the utilizations of carbon-based nanomaterials in photocatalysis. However, thus far no review article describes “making” carbon-based nanomaterials by photocatalysis. The principle of photocatalytic synthesis of carbon-based materials involves a delicate understanding of the redox abilities of a photocatalyst, and using this ability to trigger the formation of carbon or carbon precursors. It has emerged as a useful alternative technique in preparing carbon-based materials and is certainly a new and promising application of photocatalysis in materials synthesis. This perspective provides an overview of the principle and recent progress in “making” carbon-based materials from solar energy and “using” the derived materials for solar energy and other applications. The strategies for tailoring the properties of carbon materials by modulating the valence and conduction bands of a photocatalyst are summarized.
