    , Accepted 15th May 2017First published on 16th May 2017AbstractIn inverted planar heterojunction (PHJ) perovskite solar cells (PSCs), the interface layer between the electron transporting layer and the cathode plays a very important role in achieving high power efficiency. Herein, we present the synthesis of a new water/alcohol soluble small molecular cationic compound based on the naphthalene diimide functionalized pyridinium salt, N,N′-bis(1-n-hexylpyridinium-4-ylmethyl)-1,4,5,8-naphthalenetetracarboxydiimide (PN6). PN6 exhibits a large band gap (2.95 eV), high electron mobility (7.1 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1), deep LUMO energy level (−4.07 eV) and can easily form highly transparent thin films. By introducing it as a cathode interface layer in PHJ PSCs, PN6 can effectively decrease the work function of the cathode, boosting all the photovoltaic parameters of the fabricated devices. By using PN6 in the ITO/NiOx/perovskite/PC61BM/PN6/Ag device structure, a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 17.27% is obtained. Moreover, it is observed that the performance of PHJ PSCs with the PN6 interface layer is insensitive to the interlayer thickness and even at a thickness of 30 nm; the PCE of the device can still reach up to 15.37%, which makes it compatible with large-area roll-to-roll processing technology. These results demonstrate that the naphthalene diimide functionalized pyridinium salt can be a new category of water/alcohol soluble cathode interface material for high performance PHJ PSCs.
Introduction
Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells have attracted tremendous attention in the past seven years primarily due to their potential to cost-effectively generate renewable energy.1–5 The organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite materials can form nearly defect-free crystalline thin films which preserve broad optical absorbance,6 low exciton binding energy7 and long-range charge transport.6,8–10 Those unique properties of the perovskite semiconductor materials helped in improving the photovoltaic efficiency of the PSCs from the initial 3.8%11 to the record 22.1%.12
The perovskite semiconductors can be adopted in several types of solar cell architectures which include perovskite-sensitized solar cells,11 meso-superstructured solar cells13 and p-i-n type planar heterojunction (PHJ) solar cells.14 Despite the lower performance of PHJ PSCs than those based on other architectures, they are still considered to gain the most promising commercialization due to their relatively simple device architecture and potential for being fabricated by roll-to-roll processing at low-temperature with low cost.15 The commonly used architecture for PHJ PSCs is ITO/PEDOT: PSS or NiOx/perovskite layer/PC61BM/cathode.16,17 For this commonly used PHJ PSC architecture, there is a contact barrier between high work function metal and PC61BM,18,19 which leads to poor electron extraction and deteriorate the performance of the PHJ PSCs.19 Therefore, this issue needs to be addressed while fabricating PHJ PSCs. Several classes of materials have been used as cathode interlayers to enhance the electron extraction properties of PHJ PSCs, including metal salts such as LiF,20 n-type metal oxide semiconductors such as ZnO,19,21 TiOx,2,22 SnO23etc. and n-type organic small molecular semiconductors such as BCP,14,24 C60,25 Bphen,26 PCBC27etc. In addition to those materials, some of the water/alcohol-soluble organic materials have been successfully used as a cathode interlayer due to their effective cathode modification properties and environmentally friendly solution processing. Water/alcohol-soluble properties of organic interface materials are important for future industrial applications and can offer orthogonal solvent processability to prevent the solvent erosion problem during multilayer device fabrication.28 Generally, to achieve these goals, a specific functional group (ammonium,29 elthylene oxide,30 pyridinium,31 phosphonate,32etc.) is proposed. Despite the successful application of water/alcohol soluble organic materials as cathode interlayer materials, they are generally very thickness-sensitive (usually less than 10 nm). For example, the optimized thickness of the PFN,33 PN4N28 and C60-bis surfactant34 is about 5 nm. The thickness-sensitive problem excludes their compatibility with large-area roll-to-roll processing technology, which is required for low-cost PHJ perovskite solar cells. Perylene diimides as the core with amino N-oxide as the terminal substituent (PDINO),35,36 and the water/alcohol-soluble conjugated polymer PNDIT-F3N-Br37 are few thickness-insensitive cathode interlayer materials that have been reported for fabricating PHJ PSCs. Nevertheless, the previous one has absorption between 400 nm and 650 nm,38 which is a major drawback as for the interface material, in order to provide best light harvesting conditions for the active layer, avoiding light absorption in the visible region is needed. Whereas the later one has several intrinsic disadvantages over its small-molecule counterparts in terms of hard purification,39 a less-defined structure40 and worse batch-to-batch reproducibility.41 Although some papers have reported water/alcohol-soluble small molecular interface materials based on pyridinium salt in organic solar cells,31,42 there are no reported thickness insensitive cathode interface small molecular materials based on the pyridine functionalized group in PHJ PSCs and access to conjugated high electron mobility interface materials based on pyridinium salt remains a challenge.
Herein, we design and synthesize a novel n-type wide band gap water/alcohol-soluble small molecule N,N′-bis(1-n-hexylpyridin-1-ium-4-ylmethyl)-1,4,5,8-naphthalenetetracarboxydiimide (PN6). The chemical structure is shown in Fig. 1a in the device architecture of ITO/NiOx/perovskite/PC61BM/PN6/Ag and the cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of the device is shown in Fig. 1b. For PN6, it contains a naphthalene tetracarboxylic diimide (NDI) core with highly polar pyridine-functionalized chains and this choice of molecule was based on three considerations: (a) NDIs are some of the typical imide-based core structures due to their utilization in n-channel organic semiconductors due to the simplicity of synthesis and high electron affinity,43,44 (b) PN6 has two positively charged nitrogen groups that render it soluble in a water/alcohol solvent and avoid washing away of the PC61BM layer during processing and (c) introducing a pyridine group could enhance π–π interactions among molecules which is beneficial for efficient electron transport.39 In addition, the two positively charged nitrogen groups can provide low LUMO energy.45 By introducing PN6 as the cathode interface layer, the performance of PHJ PSCs is remarkably enhanced, and the device PCE is increased from 8.73% to 17.27%. Most importantly, we found that PN6 is not only an excellent cathode interface layer but also a good electron transporting material. Moreover, the performance of PHJ PSCs with the PN6 interface layer is insensitive to the interlayer thickness, as the PCEs of the PHJ PSCs still could be reached up to 15.37%, even when the thickness of the PN6 was 30 nm.

Experimental section
Materials
PC61BM was purchased from Solenne BV. Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), γ-butyrolactone, CsI, and formamidine hydroiodide (FAI) were purchased from TCI and used as received. Lead(II) iodide (PbI2), lead(II) chloride (PbCl2), NiNO3·6H2O, hydroiodic acid(99.99%) and methylamine were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received. methylammonium iodide (MAI) was synthesized in our labs according to the literature.46
Solar cell fabrication and testing
Indium tin oxide (ITO) was used as the substrate and was cleaned before oxygen-plasma treatment for 15 min. Afterward, a NiOx layer was spin-coated onto the ITO substrate according to the published procedure.47 To prepare the perovskite precursor solution, CsI, FAI, and MAI with PbI2 and PbCl2 at a molar ratio of 0.1:0.1:0.8:0.9:0.1 were dissolved in γ-butyrolactone and DMSO with a volume ratio of 7:3 and stirred at 60 °C for 12 hours. Then, the perovskite precursor solution was spin-coated onto the ITO/NiOx substrate at 1000 rpm for 20 s and 5000 rpm for 50 s and washed with toluene after 20 s at 5000 rpm during the second spin-coated step. The substrates were thermally annealed at 100 °C for 10 min. The PC61BM layer (PC61BM, 10 mg ml−1 in chloroform) was spin-coated onto the perovskite layer at 2000 rpm for 30 s. The PN6 thin films of 7–30 nm were deposited onto the PC61BM layer by spin-coating from 2 mg ml−1 to 12 mg ml−1 methanol solutions. For the film thicker than 20 nm, the thickness of PN6 was determined by the surface profiler, while the thickness of the film less than 20 nm was determined by AFM. Finally, a 90 nm Ag film was evaporated through a shadow mask in a vacuum chamber under a pressure of 1 × 10−4 pa. The active area of the device was 4.5 mm2. The J–V characteristics were measured using a Keithley 2400 source-measurement unit in the AM 1.5 G (100 mW cm−2) spectrum from a solar simulator (Newport, Oriel AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2). The light intensity was calibrated using an NREL-certified monocrystalline Si diode coupled to a KG3 filter. The incident photon-to-current efficiency spectra were measured using a solar cell photodetector responsivity measurement system (Enlitech, Inc.).
Results and discussion
PN6 was synthesized by quaternization reaction processed under nitrogen protected conditions.48 The synthesis procedure and details can be found in the ESI.† The normalized UV-vis absorption spectra of dilute PN6 solution (∼10−5 M) in methanol are displayed in Fig. 2b, together with the spectrum of solid thin films deposited by vacuum evaporation on a quartz plate. As shown in Fig. 2b, PN6 shows an absorption band in solution (320–390 nm) due to π–π* transition of the conjugated backbone. In contrast, the solid thin film shows an obvious red-shift in comparison with PN6 in diluted solution, suggesting a more ordered structure in the solid state. The absorption band of the PN6 solid state is 320–420 nm, so the optical bandgap is 2.95 eV as calculated from the onset of absorption. The wide bandgap of PN6 favors the absorption of visible light by the perovskite layer. As shown in Fig. 2c, the absorption properties of ITO/NiOx/perovskite/PC61BM/PN6 (30 nm) are almost the same with the pristine one. The cyclic voltammogram (CV) of PN6 is displayed in Fig. 2a. The LUMO of PN6 is −4.07 eV after calibration using ferrocene as a reference, which is close to the LUMO level of PC61BM (−4.2 eV) and thus makes it beneficial for electron transport from PC61BM to PN6, and then to Ag. The HOMO of PN6 is estimated to be −7.02 eV. In order to investigate the electron transporting properties of PN6, electron-only devices were fabricated. The electron mobility was measured by using the SCLC method.49Fig. 2d shows the J–V characteristics of the electron-only device based on the architecture of ITO/ZnO/PN6/Ag. The electron mobility of the PN6 film is found to be 7.1 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1.

The film morphology of the PN6 atop the PC61BM layer was studied by atomic force microscopy (AFM). As shown in Fig. 3a, the perovskite/PC61BM thin films show a very rough surface morphology with a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 5.74 nm. Therefore, in order to uniformly cover the PC61BM layer, a thin interface layer at least 6 nm is needed. After depositing 7 nm PN6 onto PC61BM, the surface becomes much smoother with a RMS roughness of 3.39 nm (Fig. 3b), suggesting that the surface of the PC61BM film is uniformly and fully covered by the PN6 layer.

To investigate the effect of the PN6 interface layer on the PHJ PSC performance, perovskite solar cells with the PHJ architecture of ITO/NiOx/perovskite/PC61BM/PN6/Ag (Fig. 1) were fabricated and the detailed fabrication process is provided in the experimental section. Here, NiOx was used as a hole transporting layer (HTL) instead of conventional HTL PEDOT:PSS due to its better energy level alignment with perovskite.16,47 The perovskite thin film was prepared through the solvent-engineering technology which is reported by Seok's group.50 The morphology of the deposited perovskite layer on NiOx is shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†) (SEM image), which reveals a very uniform and dense perovskite layer with a grain size of 300–600 nm. For comparison, the control device without PN6 was also fabricated and tested. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the devices under 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5 G illumination are shown in Fig. 3a and the corresponding performance of the devices is summarized in Table 1.

For the control device without PN6, the maximum PCE obtained is 8.73% with an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.08 V, a short circuit current (Jsc) of 18.36 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 43.96%. Note that the control device shows an S-shaped J–V curve in Fig. 4a, which has been reported by many groups when they fabricated PHJ PSCs based on the PC61BM/Ag architecture.18,35 Usually, S-shaped J–V curves result from carrier accumulation inside the devices.51 In comparison, the device with PN6 as the cathode interface layer shows significant improvement of device parameters, showing the maximum PCE of 17.27% with a higher Voc of 1.11 V, an enhanced Jsc of 20.53 mA cm−2 and an increased FF of 76.07%. Meanwhile, the series resistance decreases from 340.9 Ω cm2 to 4.0 Ω cm2. The decrease of the series resistance and the improvement of the Jsc and FF indicate enhanced carrier extraction from the PC61BM to the Ag cathode layer after inserting the PN6 interface layer between the PC61BM and the Ag cathode. Additionally, devices with PN6 show negligible J–V hysteresis as shown in Fig. 4b. The enhancement in Jsc after inserting PN6 is consistent with the incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency spectrum shown in Fig. 4c, the calculated Jsc value of the control device is 18.43 mA cm−2, which is in good agreement with the measured Jsc value of 18.36 mA cm−2 in Fig. 4a. As revealed by Fig. 4c, the EQE values in the entire photo-response range between 300 nm and 750 nm are significantly enhanced after inserting PN6. As a result, the calculated Jsc is 19.47 mA cm−2, in good agreement with the measured Jsc value of 20.53 mA cm−2.

(d) Stable output power efficiency and photocurrent density biased near the maximum power point of the studied solar cell. 
To evaluate the power output reliability of the fabricated PHJ PSCs with PN6, a stabilized power output was measured under a constant voltage bias of 0.92 V near the maximum power output point and is shown in Fig. 4d. The device with PN6 showed very stable power output and a steady-state PCE of 17.27% is obtained. These results demonstrate that PN6 is a promising cathode interface layer for PHJ PSCs.
To understand why the PHJ PSCs with PN6 exhibit better device performance than the control devices and to get insight into the electronic properties of the PN6 interface layer, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS)52 was applied. UPS was used to probe the work functions of pure Ag and PN6 modified Ag. Fig. 5 displays the results of UPS measurements for bare Ag and PN6/Ag. For bare Ag, the work function is 4.7 eV, while after spin coating a thin layer (7 nm) of PN6 on the Ag electrode, the work function of Ag is decreased to 4.05 eV. Moreover, the UPS results indicate that the work function of PN6/Ag remains almost constant with different thicknesses of PN6 as shown in the Fig. S3, ESI.† The observed significant decrease in work function of Ag after depositing the PN6 interface layer can be attributed to the formation of large interfacial dipoles by the pyridine group with the Ag electrode. The reduction of the Ag work function could facilitate more efficient electron collection at the Ag cathode, as well as the higher built in potential across the devices.33 The more efficient electron collection at the Ag cathode after inserting the PN6 interface layer is well consistent with the higher EQE response and lower Rct results. Hence, the reduction of the Ag work function is responsible for the higher Voc and FF, as well as the increase in Jsc.

As we discussed earlier, in roll-to-roll processing the main disadvantage of the application of the interface layer is that the performance of the devices is highly sensitive to the thickness of the interface layer. Generally, increasing the thickness of the interface layer will inevitably increase the bulk resistance of the interface layer and adversely affect the device performance.53 Providing the relative high electron mobility of PN6, we further investigated the dependence of the PHJ PSC performance by varying the thickness of the PN6 interface layer from 7 nm to 30 nm using different concentrations of the PN6 solution. The performance of the PHJ PSCs with different interface layer thicknesses is summarized in Table 2 and the corresponding J–V curves are shown in Fig. 6a.

As shown in Table 2 and Fig. 6a, the performance of devices is not much sensitive to the thickness of PN6. The optimized PN6 thickness of 7 nm yields a device with a PCE of 17.27%. When the PN6 thickness is increased to 30 nm, the device shows some drop in Jsc and FF, with the PCE of 15.37%, which is still much higher than that of the Ag only device. In contrast, the device (Table S1 and Fig. S2, ESI†) with a 20 nm thickness of PFN as the interface layer shows the PCE of only 1.47%. Fig. 6b shows the EQE spectra of PHJ PSCs with different PN6 interface layer thicknesses to verify the differences in Jsc. Interestingly, all devices showed almost the same EQE response from 300 nm to 600 nm, but a lower EQE response for devices with thicker PN6 from 600 nm to 800 nm. Thus, the lower EQE response leads to drop in Jsc for devices with thicker PN6 due to the higher recombination possibility in the long wavelength region.54
As we have shown before, the electron mobility of the device with the PN6 interface layer is 7.6 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is ten times higher than that of the devices with the evaporated interface material BCP (5.5 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1),55 meanwhile the LUMO level of PN6 (−4.06 eV) is much close to the LUMO level of PC61BM (−4.2 eV), which facilitates electron transfer through PN6 to the cathode. For some thickness insensitive interface materials, the electron transport properties can be enhanced by the self-doping effect. To check whether PN6 possesses this self-doping property, electron spin resonance spectroscopy (ESR) was carried out. As shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†), a weak ESR signal is observed for PN6, indicating the effect of self-doping in PN6.Thus the EPS result provides direct evidence of self-doping in PN6, which leads to enhanced electron transport properties of PN6.
The ambient stability of PSCs is very important for their practical application. To investigate the ambient stability of devices with and without the PN6 interface layer, the normalized PCE, as a function of time, was recorded (Fig. 7). The PHJ PSCs were un-encapsulated and stored in the ambient atmosphere with a humidity of 40%. As shown in Fig. 7, compared with the device without the PN6 interlayer, the stability of the device with the PN6 interlayer is obviously improved. For the device with the PN6 interlayer, the PCE can maintain 90% of its initial value after storing for about 200 h. In contrast, the PCE of the device without the PN6 interlayer drops to 63% of its initial value after storing for the same time. These results demonstrate that the PN6 interlayer can block the penetration of moisture to some extent, which is beneficial for improving the device stability.

Conclusions
In summary, we have developed a new pyridine-functionalized NDI core small molecule as an efficient interface layer to enhance the performance of PHJ PSCs. By using PN6 as the interface layer, the fabricated PHJ PSCs showed enhancement in open circuit voltage, short circuit current density and fill factor, resulting in the power conversion efficiency of up to 17.27%, which is almost two times higher than that of the devices without the interface layer. UPS revealed that the pyridine functionalized group can form the large interfacial dipoles in the Ag cathode, decreases the work function of Ag, which improve all the photovoltaic parameters of PHJ PSCs. In addition, PCEs as high as 15.37–17.27% are obtained by PHJ PSCs within a wide range of the PN6 thickness (7–30 nm) due to the suitable LUMO level and the relatively high electron mobility of PN6. Thus, the specific properties and very simple synthesis processes of the PN6 make it the potential candidate as the cathode interface layer for solution processed PHJ PSCs and can be applied in a roll-to-roll process.
