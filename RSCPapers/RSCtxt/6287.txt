    , Accepted 16th April 2014First published on 16th April 2014AbstractThis study reports the synthesis of ZnxCd1−xSe quantum dot-sensitized titania nanotube array photoelectrodes using a successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction technique and evaluates the photoelectrochemical performance as anodes. The effect of altering the number of sensitization cycles and annealing temperature on optical and photoelectrochemical properties of prepared photoanodes was studied. Surface morphology of the sensitized tubes was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy, while the phase composition was determined using X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy techniques. Spectral response measurements indicated that TiO2 nanotube arrays coupled with ZnxCd1−xSe quantum dots synthesized in 7 cycles of deposition and annealed at 300 °C for 1 h under N2 exhibited excellent photoelectrochemical properties. The notably high photovoltaic characteristics demonstrate the potential of the ZnxCd1−xSe/TiO2 heterostructure as an efficient photoanode.
Introduction
The last few decades have witnessed significant advances in photovoltaic technology. Since the advent of DSSC technology by O'Regan and Grätzel in 1991,1 there has been a surge in interest in the design and synthesis of an efficient photoactive material with optimal band gap for the sensitization of wide band-gap semiconductor materials (such as TiO2 and ZnO). It is well-known that TiO2 is a promising candidate material for photovoltaic cells due to its intriguing physico-chemical properties, such as high photosensitivity2 and non-toxicity.2 Despite its excellent electronic and optical properties, this material poses some drawbacks which limit its efficiency as a promising substrate material. This includes its high intrinsic band gap of 3.2 eV (λ ≤ 387 nm) for the anatase phase and a high recombination rate of photogenerated electron–hole pairs.3 The high bandgap results in absorption in the UV region which accounts for less than 5% of the solar spectrum.4 The latter can be mitigated by the use of 1-D nanostructures of titania instead of nanoparticles.5 This strategy not only provides a direct and efficient pathway for photogenerated charges,2,6 but also a higher surface area for sensitizer deposition.7 However, to improve the photoresponse of TiO2 in the visible region, various approaches have been adopted, such as transition metal ion doping,8 non-metal doping,9 noble metal doping,10 surface modification by organic dyes11–14 and narrow band gap semiconductor materials.3,4,7,15–20 Compared with other sensitizers, semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) have promising properties as photosensitizers which include a tunable band gap,21 multiple exciton generation22 and a high absorption coefficient.23 Synthesis of binary and ternary quantum dots with varied structural, compositional and photophysical properties and their use as potential photosensitizer materials for wide band gap semiconductors has been the subject of recent reports.4,7,17,24–29 A common strategy is the ex situ approach, which employs the use of linker molecules to bind pre-synthesized quantum dots to TiO2.25,26 Another approach includes in situ deposition of quantum dots by the use of chemical bath deposition (CBD)28,30 or successive ion layer absorption and reaction (SILAR) techniques.24,31,32
Compared to other techniques such as, spray pyrolysis,33 electrodeposition34,35 and electrophoretic deposition,36 the SILAR method is particularly useful for introduction of various dopants as well as tailoring of the surface properties of the adherent via a simple and inexpensive deposition technique.31 The SILAR method is basically a modified version of the chemical bath deposition technique. The advantages of the SILAR method include better control over growth/deposition and the film thickness (by simply varying the number of deposition cycles) since the cationic and anionic solutions are taken in different vessels.32
Over the last decade, several studies have been reported on sensitization of TiO2 using various narrow band-gap semiconductor materials such as ZnS,20 CdS,17 CdSe,15 CdTe,19 Ag2S,4 MnTe18 and CuInS2.7 In 2009, Lee et al. reported a CdS/CdSe co-sensitized TiO2 photoelectrode and it exhibited an efficiency of 4.22% under 1 sun illumination.24 Later, Santra and Kamat27 synthesized a liquid junction Mn-doped CdS/CdSe QD solar cell that demonstrated an efficiency of 5%. In another report, Shanmugam et al. demonstrated the synthesis of the heterojunction ITO/TiO2/CdSe/ML-GO/Pt solar cell with a photoconversion efficiency of 4.1%.29 Sauvage and co-workers electrodeposited CdSe onto TiO2 and the resulting material was found to have a power conversion efficiency of 0.8%.37 Mukherjee et al. studied the effect of surface treatment on the photoelectrochemical properties of CdSe-sensitized TiO2 nanotubes and found that treatment with TiCl4 resulted in 7.4% increase in photovoltage.38 Recently, Song et al. prepared a TiO2/CdSe/ZnS photoanode and a power conversion efficiency of 2.72% was observed.35
Although many binary semiconductor quantum dots have already been investigated with TiO2 and related photoanodes, ternary alloys such as ZnxCd1−xSe offer the advantage of fabrication of the sensitizing material with tunable band gap and conduction band edge just by the variation of the stoichiometry. The ZnxCd1−xSe semiconductor alloy exhibits a bandgap of 1.6–2.7 eV depending upon the composition,39,40 suggesting that its coupling with wide band gap semiconductors, such as TiO2 would allow increased absorption in both the UV and visible light regions of the solar spectrum, thus allowing better light harvesting, and resulting in higher efficiency photoelectrodes. In 2011, Li et al. studied the ZnxCd1−xSe–ZnO core–shell nanostructures for photoelectrochemical hydrogen generation that was found to produce a photocurrent density of ∼5.6 mA cm−2 under 1 sun illumination.41 Myung et al. fabricated ZnO–ZnxCd1−xSe core–shell nanowire arrays on ITO substrates by a chemical vapor transport method and found that the shell with x = 0.2–0.3 resulted in the highest photoconversion efficiency.42 Recently, the authors demonstrated the viability of ZnxCd1−xSe QDs to positively affect the photoelectrochemical properties of TiO2 NTAs and the long-term stability of such ZnxCd1−xSe QD sensitized TiO2 NTAs.43 While the present work was in progress, emboldening data were reported by Yang et al. showing phenomenologically that ZnxCd1−xSe QDs prepared through an ion-exchange route also markedly enhances the performance of the particulate TiO2 photoelectrode, although analysis of the effect of SILAR deposited ZnxCd1−xSe QDs on TiO2 NTAs was not the focus of that study.44 To the best of our knowledge, there has been no report on fabrication of ZnxCd1−xSe-sensititized TiO2 NTA photoanodes by the SILAR process. Moreover, the number of deposition cycles and post-deposition annealing temperature were found to have a pronounced impact on the photoelectrochemical response of TiO2 NTAs, which has not been investigated before. In the continuation of our previous work, the present study evaluates the effect of interfacing TiO2 NTA photoanodes with ZnxCd1−xSe sensitization using the SILAR method. In this study, ZnCdSe was deposited onto anodized titania using the SILAR method and the PEC performance of the resulting electrodes was evaluated. The surface chemistry of the electrodes was studied using surface analytical techniques. The stability of the electrodes was characterized using both surface analysis and solution analysis.
Experimental details
Synthesis of TiO2 NT arrays
A detailed description of the anodization process used for growth of nanotubes in this study has been described elsewhere.16,45 Titanium (Ti) foils (99% purity, 0.005 inches thick) were supplied by STREM chemicals. Foils of size ∼2.5 cm2 were degreased by ultrasonic cleaning in the 1:1 mixture of acetone (reagent grade) and isopropyl alcohol (IPA, ACS grade) for 10 min prior to anodization. The cleaned Ti strip was anodized at a constant potential of 30 V for 2 h (Circuit Specialists power supply CSI12001X) in a two electrode cell with a coiled platinum wire as the counter electrode. Ethylene glycol (Sigma Aldrich, 99%) containing 0.5 wt% NH4F (Acros Organics, 98%) and 3 wt% DI water was used as the electrolyte solution. After anodization, the amorphous TiO2 films were washed with IPA and annealed at 450 °C under air for 2 h (at a slow heating rate of 4 °C min−1) to obtain desired crystallization.
Deposition of ZnCdSe quantum dots
ZnCdSe quantum dots were attached to TiO2 NTAs using the SILAR process. The process involved subsequent immersions of the TiO2 NTA substrate in solutions of 0.02 M Zn2+ (zinc nitrate, Fisher Scientific, 99.9%) followed by 0.02 M Cd2+ (cadmium acetate, GFS chemicals, 98%) and finally in 0.02 M Na2Se. The Na2Se solution was generated in situ by reducing Se metal with 0.04 M NaBH4 (Acros Organics, 98+%). All solutions were prepared in 1:1 ethanol (ACS grade):H2O solvent. The use of ethanol as the solvent results in superior penetration within TiO2 NTAs because of its lower surface tension.4 After each deposition, the substrate was washed with 1:1 ethanol:H2O solution for the same amount of time to avoid homogenous precipitation in the solution. The three-step dipping process comprises of one SILAR cycle and was carried out under ambient pressure and temperature conditions. The deposition was carried out for 3, 5, 7 and 10 cycles with 1 minute dipping time per step. To study the effect of thermal treatment, the samples were annealed at temperatures of 200 °C and 300 °C under N2 atmosphere for 1 hour.
Characterization
The morphology of prepared films was studied using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and the surface chemistry was characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and photoabsorption properties studied using UV-Vis spectrophotometry. The topological features and surface morphologies of the sensitized TiO2 NTA films were examined by a Hitachi S-4800 scanning electron microscope equipped with an energy dispersive spectrometer (Oxford EDS system). The crystallographic interpretations were performed using a PANalytical X'Pert Pro X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα wavelength (λ = 1.54 Å; 45 kV, 40 mA) and scanning in the 2θ range from 20° to 80°. Light absorption properties were measured using a Shimadzu UV-2400 UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectrometer to detect light absorption over the range of 200–800 nm. Stoichiometry measurements were performed by a Perkin Elmer Optima 8000 inductively-coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES). The sensitized film was dipped in concentrated aqua regia (1:3 HNO3:HCl) solution which was further diluted to 10% (in water) before analysis. XPS spectra were recorded using a PHI 5600 model X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS) with a monochromatic AlKα (1486.6 eV) excitation source. The spectrometer was calibrated to the Ag 3d5/2 line at 368.27 ± 0.05 eV. The XPS spectra were recorded at 14 kV and 300 W, with an analysis area of 800 μm2. The survey spectra were acquired at a pass energy of 29.35 eV and narrow scans at 23.95 eV. Charging effects were corrected using the adventitious C 1s line at 284.6 eV as an internal reference. All peaks were fitted using SDP v4.6 Gaussian fitting software from XPS International and underwent five point smoothing. The photoelectrochemical (PEC) responses of the samples were measured in a standard three-electrode configuration where TiO2 NTA or sensitized TiO2 NTA served as the anode; coiled platinum wire and a calomel electrode served as the cathode and reference electrode, respectively. The measurements were conducted under ambient conditions in a custom made quartz window cell in an aqueous solution of 0.35 M Na2SO3 and 0.25 M Na2S as the electrolyte. A Gamry® Reference 600 potentiostat was used to control the potential and to record the photocurrent generated. A 300 W Xe lamp solar simulator supplied by Newport was used to illuminate the photoanodes with 100 mW cm−2 intensity under standard AM 1.5 (1 sun intensity) illumination. The light intensity was measured using a Newport Thermopile Sensor 919P-003-10, 3 W, 10 mm aperture.
Results and discussions
Optical studies
The absorption spectra of ZnxCd1−xSe sensitized TiO2 NTAs prepared through 3, 5, 7 and 10 SILAR cycles followed by annealing at various temperatures are presented along with the absorption profile of unsensitized TiO2 NTAs in Fig. 1. The spectra are denoted as TiO2 NTA/ZnxCd1−xSe(3), TiO2 NTA/ZnxCd1−xSe(5), TiO2 NTA/ZnxCd1−xSe(7), and TiO2 NTA/ZnxCd1−xSe(10), where the number in the parenthesis indicates the number of cycles of sensitization, and are shown in Fig. 1a–d, respectively. The spectra reveal that the pure TiO2 NTA film absorbs mostly in the UV region (λ < 400 nm) which corresponds to its intrinsic band gap of 3.2 eV. The absorption peak below 400 nm is mainly due to the charge transfer from the valence band of oxide anions (formed mainly by 2p orbitals) to the conduction band of Ti4+ cations (formed mainly by 3dt2g orbitals).46,47 A broad absorption shoulder observed around 500 nm can be ascribed to the oxygen-deficiency in the film.48 After sensitization, the optical absorption is found to extend into the visible region and the absorption edge is shifted towards longer wavelength. The red shift is more pronounced with the increase in the number of SILAR cycles due to an increase in the thickness of the deposited layer. This can be attributed to the size quantization effect, as described elsewhere.49 Moreover, the thermal treatment under N2 flow tends to introduce a shift in the band edge towards longer wavelength in all cases (absorption onset for the film annealed at 200 °C in Fig. 1d occurs at approximately 750 nm). This indicates the high absorption coefficient of ZnxCd1−xSe quantum dots attached to TiO2 NTAs which is extended to almost the whole visible region. UV-Vis absorption spectra of films with different deposition cycles and annealed at 300 °C are shown in the ESI (Fig. S1†). However, with loading higher than 7 cycles of deposition (10 cycles), a decline in overall absorption was observed, which can be attributed to the aggregation of ZnxCd1−xSe nanocrystals. The agglomerated nanocrystallites result in decreased photocurrent and hence are less effective as a sensitizer. Similar results have been reported by Gao et al.50 and Feng et al.51 in the case of CdTe-modified TiO2 nanotube arrays. Therefore, further studies were limited to 3, 5 and 7 cycles of deposition.

The absorption edge was found to undergo the red shift with increase in the number of deposition cycles. 
Phase determination
The small angle X-ray diffraction (SAXRD) pattern of modified and unmodified TiO2 NTAs is shown in Fig. 2. The diffraction pattern of unmodified TiO2 NTAs exhibited peaks corresponding to that of the anatase phase of TiO2 (JCPDS card no. 00-021-1272, peaks labelled as ‘A’) along with the diffraction peaks of Ti foil (JCPDS card no. 44-1294, peaks labelled as ‘T’). Fig. 2b shows the XRD pattern of TiO2 NTA/ZnxCd1−xSe(7) films before and after thermal annealing at 200 °C and 300 °C, respectively. The XRD patterns reveal that signals from the as-deposited sample match well with those of the pure TiO2 (anatase phase). In comparison, XRD patterns after thermal treatment under N2 indicates the presence of additional distinct signals at 2θ values of 25.4°, 42.4° and 49.7°, which can be identified as (111), (220) and (311) planes of cadmium selenide (JCPDS card no. 19-0191). However, the strongest peak for the CdSe (111) plane (at 25.4°) is difficult to be identified as it coincides with the (101) peak of anatase TiO2. This indicates that the SILAR deposition results only in the physical adsorption of Cd and Se adatoms on the surface of TiO2 NTAs, which manifest into a more crystalline structure upon heat treatment in nitrogen. It can be noted further that with increase in annealing temperature, the crystalline nature of quantum dots has been improved. The absence of Zn in the XRD patterns can be attributed to the fact that Zn is present in very nominal concentrations, as discussed later.

Microscopic analysis

Fig. 3 and 4 depict the representative SEM images of TiO2 NTA/ZnxCd1−xSe composite films before and after thermal treatment under nitrogen atmosphere. Fig. 4 shows lateral representative images of the as-deposited TiO2 NTA/ZnxCd1−xSe film (Fig. 4a) and the film after annealing (Fig. 4b). Fig. 3a shows the typical image of the as-deposited (unannealed) TiO2 NTA/ZnxCd1−xSe composite film, depicting the highly oriented framework of nanotubes with a diameter of 70–80 nm and a wall thickness of approximately 10 nm. The cross-sectional image (Fig. 4a) reveals that NTAs are of 2–3 μm in length and are densely packed together, depicting an ordered array of the nanotubular structure. These vertically oriented NTAs not only provide a large surface area for the deposition of QDs but also well-defined channels for efficient charge transport. Representative images of films sensitized with 5 and 7 cycles of SILAR deposition and annealed under nitrogen atmosphere are provided in Fig. 3b–d, respectively. It is observed that in the case of the as-deposited film, the fine nanoparticles are strewn all over the rim as well as inside of the NTAs. The particles were fused together and resulted in an array of particles on TiO2 NTAs upon annealing. These fused particles are present predominantly along the mouth of the walls (Fig. 3b–d). Increasing the number of SILAR deposition cycles of ZnxCd1−xSe on TiO2 NTAs resulted in partial blocking of NTA opening due to the dense particle loading. Fig. 4a and b indicate that after sensitization followed by the annealing process, the side walls of the TiO2 NTAs become rough and possess fine particles scattered over the surface. Fig. 4a and b also reveal the evidence of fine deposits of ZnxCd1−xSe nanocrystals on the inner walls of the nanotubes. This is expected since the inner walls provide less resistance to mass transfer.

ICP analysis
The stoichiometry of the ZnxCd1−xSe deposit was determined using ICP-OES. The obtained results and stoichiometry calculations are summarized in Table 1. The low concentration of Zn is evident from the low value of x (about 0.14), which is in accordance with the other observed results. The atomic ratio of Zn:Cd was also analysed as a function of number of deposition cycles. The ratio was found to be similar for all the films. The values for films with 3, 5 and 7 cycles of deposition were found to be 5.13 ± 0.05, 5.15 ± 0 and 5.10 ± 0, respectively.

XPS analysis
To examine the chemical composition of the films, the XPS spectra of ZnxCd1−xSe films deposited onto TiO2 NTAs were recorded and are provided in Fig. 6. The figures exhibit the detailed core-level scans of Cd 3d, Zn 3p and Se 3d regions. The spin-orbit doublets at 411.8 and 405.0 eV (with a separation of 6.8 eV) correspond to Cd 3d3/2 and Cd 3d5/2 peaks, respectively (Fig. 6a). The obtained values indicate the presence of the Cd–Se bond52 since the peaks are shifted towards higher binding energy values compared to metallic Cd 3d peaks (3d3/2 – 411.6 eV, 3d5/2 – 404.8 eV). The Se 3d peak presented in Fig. 6b, appears in a well-defined doublet associated with spin-orbit coupling. B. Canava et al. presented a detailed study of Se 3d suggesting that the shift between the two components associated with Se 3d5/2 (main and second contribution) varies with the preparation technique of samples.53 The binding energy values obtained for the Se 3d5/2 core level at 53.8 and 54.7 eV (separation of 0.9 eV) are in well accordance with the values reported for CdSe monocrystals.
 Fig. 6  X-ray photoelectron spectra for the TiO2 NTA/ZnxCd1−xSe composite film showing (a) Cd 3d peak (b) Se 3d peak and (c) Zn 2p peak. The spectra indicate the presence of Cd2+, Zn2+ and Se2− on the surface of the sensitized film. 
The core-level spectra of Zn 2p are presented in Fig. 6c. The Zn 2p peak splits into a doublet of 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 with a separation of 23.1 eV. The two peaks observed at binding energy values of 1021.7 and 1044.8 eV can be assigned to 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 peaks, respectively. The observed peaks can be attributed to the presence of Zn atoms as Zn2+ on the surface of the material.54,55 Thus, Zn atoms might replace some of the Cd atoms in the CdSe structure and form a Zn–Se bond.
Photoelectrochemical measurements

Fig. 7 shows the current–voltage (I–V) characteristics of various TiO2 NTAs measured in 0.25 M Na2S and 0.35 M Na2SO3 electrolyte under a constant illumination of 100 mW cm−2. The advantage of using a mixture of 0.25 M Na2S and 0.35 M Na2SO3 aqueous solution as the electrolyte lies in the fact that Na2S in solution acts as a hole scavenger and prevents the photocorrosion of CdSe by oxidizing into S22−. Na2SO3 added to Na2S results in the reduction of disulfides back to sulfides, S22− + SO32− → S2− + S2O32−, which has been shown to significantly increase the amount of hydrogen production at the cathode.56 Moreover, cadmium chalcogenides have higher stability and photocurrent in the polysulfide redox electrolyte system than the I−/I3− redox system.19,57 Unmodified TiO2 NTAs produce a photocurrent of ∼0.4 mA cm−2, due to limited absorption of visible light. Several key observations can be noted by performing a comparative analysis of I–V curves of ZnxCd1−xSe-sensitized TiO2 NTAs formed with various cycles of deposition and thermal annealing temperatures. First, for a particular set of deposition cycle, the thermal treatment under nitrogen atmosphere resulted in an increase of photocurrent. The photocurrent density of TiO2 NTA/ZnxCd1−xSe(3) is enhanced to 3.9 mA cm−2 (39% increase) and 7.9 mA cm−2 (182% increase) after annealing at 200 °C and 300 °C, respectively compared to the unannealed TiO2 NTA/ZnxCd1−xSe(3) films (2.8 mA cm−2) (Fig. 7a). The photocurrent values have been summarized in Table T1 provided in the ESI.† Similar influence of annealing temperature on the photocurrent density enhancement is also observed for TiO2 NTA/ZnxCd1−xSe(5) and TiO2 NTA/ZnxCd1−xSe(7) films (Fig. 7b and c). This can be attributed to the increased particle size of nanocrystals with annealing (as observed in Fig. 3 and 4) and enhanced crystallinity of quantum dots as explained earlier in XRD results. Improved crystalline nature results in better light-harvesting ability and efficient charge transport.58,59
 Fig. 7  
I–V characteristics of various ZnxCd1−xSe-sensitized working electrodes measured under 100 mW cm−2 intensity (AM 1.5 global filter): (a) TiO2 NTA/ZnxCd1−xSe(3), (b) TiO2 NTA/ZnxCd1−xSe(5), and (c) TiO2 NTA/ZnxCd1−xSe(7). Current density increases by up to 30-fold compared to unsensitized TiO2 NTAs. 
Moreover, the open circuit potential was found to undergo an anodic shift with increase in post deposition annealing temperature. The change in the onset potential demonstrates a shift of the Fermi level to a more negative potential with increasing annealing temperatures.27,60 The shift in the Fermi level can be ascribed to electron accumulation in the composite film leading to improved charge separation between TiO2 and the sensitizer, and thus, enhanced photocurrent.61 Annealing the samples further at 400 °C under N2 atmosphere was not found to be effective as the films produced lower photocurrent densities compared to that of 300 °C annealed films (not represented here).
Further, with the increase in the number of SILAR cycles from 3 to 5, the photocurrent densities of TiO2 NTA/ZnxCd1−xSe(5) films that were annealed at 300 °C increased significantly and reached 11.48 mA cm−2 (Fig. 7b). This enhancement can be envisioned as a result of increased light absorption with increased ZnxCd1−xSe loading in the visible light range, as indicated in Fig. 1. However, with further increase in SILAR cycles (from 5 to 7 cycles), there is only a slight increase in the photoresponse (12.70 mA cm−2 for 7 cycles of deposition). The possible reasons for this observation might be the agglomeration of nanocrystals and partial blocking of nanotube openings by quantum dots, which can limit the charge transport through them.19,50 It should be noted that the repeated photocurrent values from samples prepared from different batches may vary by a factor of ±10% due to variation in experimental conditions, however the trend remains the same.
The increased photocurrent in the case of sensitized films might be attributed to smaller recombination and effective charge transfer of photo-induced carriers at the TiO2–ZnxCd1−xSe interface since the conduction band of the sensitizer lies above that of TiO2. A similar result has been reported by Yang et al. in 2013.44 More importantly, the efficient interfacial charge transfer between the ZnxCd1−xSe sensitizer and TiO2 can be ascribed to the presence of Zn doping. To support this hypothesis, a study was conducted with CdSe loading only (with the same precursor solutions for the same deposition time) and the films were annealed at 300 °C under N2 atmosphere. The I–V measurements were conducted for as-deposited films with 3, 5 and 7 cycles of deposition and films annealed at 300 °C (Fig. 8). The current recorded in each case was found to be much lower than the respective ZnxCd1−xSe loading on TiO2 NTAs. The results obtained indicate that Zn doping has a significant role in enhancing the photoresponse of sensitized films.

Current density is seen to be much lower than those seen for ZnxCd1−xSe sensitized films shown in Fig. 7. 
The photoresponse of TiO2 NTA/ZnxCd1−xSe films under discontinuous illumination is shown in Fig. 9. The measurements were carried out at 0 V vs. SCE and indicate the reproducibility and stability of the photoresponse.62 All the samples show an abrupt change in current upon illumination. The current retracts back to its original value rapidly once the light source is turned off. The trend is repeated with 5 s on–off cycles and indicates that the anodes are stable under photoillumination for 75 s. Long term I–t studies showed that the photocurrent decreased by 53.88% after 2 hours and by 79.6% after about 24 hours (Fig. S4†). The reproducibility and stable photoresponse can be attributed to the formation of a coherent ZnxCd1−xSe–TiO2 interface that allows efficient electron transport from ZnxCd1−xSe into the TiO2 nanotubes. The photoelectrochemical responses obtained in our study are higher than the values reported previously for various sensitized-TiO2 photoelectrodes.4,5,7,15,51,60,56,63 Also, the results obtained in this study are in agreement with results reported by Yang et al.44

I–t characteristics of various ZnxCd1−xSe-sensitized working electrodes measured under 100 mW cm−2 intensity (AM 1.5 global filter): (a) TiO2 NTA/ZnxCd1−xSe(3), (b) TiO2 NTA/ZnxCd1−xSe(5), and (c) TiO2 NTA/ZnxCd1−xSe(7). The figure shows that the material is stable and current density increases rapidly upon illumination. 
The electronic properties of sensitized and unsensitized TiO2 NTA films were determined using the Mott–Schottky (MS) method. The measurements were performed at a frequency of 100 Hz, with the potential scan range from 0.5 to −1 V (vs. SCE) under illumination. The Mott–Schottky technique is based on a well-established theory of the semiconductor–electrolyte interface,64–66 which exploits the linearity in 1/C2vs. V curves to determine charge carrier density (NA) and flat-band potential (EFB) using eqn (1) and (2). (1) (2)where C is the capacitance, e is the elementary electronic charge, εo is the permittivity in the vacuum, ε is the dielectric constant (8 for CdSe67 and 86 for TiO264), E is the applied potential, k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, and m is the slope of the linear portion (the potential range within which the material behaves as capacitors) of 1/C2vs. E plots (depicted in Fig. 10).
 Fig. 10  Mott–Schottky plot of the sensitized TiO2 NTA films with different cycles of deposition under illuminated conditions in 0.25 M Na2S + 0.35 M Na2SO3. Films were polarized from 0.5 V to −1 V at 100 Hz. 
The charge carrier densities were calculated to be 2.24 × 1020, 2.35 × 1020 cm−3 and 2.77 × 1020 for TiO2 NTA/ZnxCd1−xSe(3), TiO2 NTA/ZnxCd1−xSe(3) and TiO2 NTA/ZnxCd1−xSe(7) composite films, respectively. The increase in the charge carrier density (NA) with increase in the number of deposition cycles indicates more effective charge separation, which leads to the increased lifetime of photogenerated electron–hole pairs. The increased lifetime of the charge carrier accounts for the enhanced photoelectrochemical performance of the TiO2 NTA/ZnxCd1−xSe(7) composite film.
The band gap of ternary alloy can be calculated based on the quadratic equation,68,69  where, Eg(ZnSe) and Eg(CdSe) are the bulk gap of ZnSe (2.7 eV) and CdSe (1.74 eV), respectively. The constant b (0.67 eV for ZnxCd1−xSe) is referred to as the bowing parameter, which arises from various structural and electronic factors and alters the band structure, as described previously.70,71 Substituting the value of x (0.14) as estimated by ICP analysis, the calculated value for Eg(ZnxCd1−xSe) is 1.79 eV. Schematic of the hypothesized model for electron transport from ZnxCd1−xSe QDs to TiO2 is presented in Fig. 11. An energetically favorable transfer of electrons occurs from the conduction band of ZnxCd1−xSe to the CB of TiO2.

Conclusions
In this study, ZnxCd1−xSe-sensitized TiO2 NTAs have been reported as efficient photoanodes. The QDs were deposited by the facile SILAR process onto TiO2 NTA walls prepared by a simple anodization technique. The effect of SILAR cycles and post deposition annealing temperature on optical and photoelectrochemical properties of photoanodes was investigated. The ZnxCd1−xSe-modified TiO2 NTAs exhibit up to a 30-fold increase in the photocurrent density compared to unmodified TiO2 NTAs, which can be attributed mainly to the extended absorption in the visible region and better photogenerated charge carrier separation. The optimum energy conversion efficiency was obtained in 7 cycles of deposition. The results indicate the potential of ZnxCd1−xSe/TiO2 NTA photoanodes as a promising candidate for photovoltaic device applications.
