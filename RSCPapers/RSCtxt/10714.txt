    , Accepted 20th November 2014First published on 20th November 2014AbstractAmphiphilic trismethylpyridylporphyrin-C70 (PC70) dyad with improved photosensitization has been successfully prepared. The PC70 dyad forms a liposomal nanostructure through molecular self-assembling. An increased absorption coefficient in the visible region, good biocompatibility, and high photostability were observed on the self-assembling structure. Surprisingly, in comparison with previously reported photosensitizer porphyrins, PC70 exhibited an enhanced photodynamic therapy (PDT) effect under hypoxia conditions. Further investigations illustrated that PC70 went through an extremely long-life triplet state (211.3 μs) under hypoxia, which enabled the exiguous oxygen to approach and interact with the activated (3P-C70)* more efficiently and produce more singlet oxygen. This would overcome the problem of existing photosensitizers of low PDT efficiency in cancerous tissues under hypoxia. The excellent properties of PC70 dyad make it a promising phototherapeutic agent, especially for the treatment of early- and late-stage cancers under shallow and hypoxia tissues.
Introduction
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has recently attracted considerable attention because of its fine controllability, improved selectivity, and low systemic toxicity.1 Photosensitizers (PSs) as PDT agents could react with oxygen in tissues upon light irradiation to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are highly toxic to tumor cells.2 However, current applications of PDT agents, such as hematoporphyrin,3 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA),4 tin ethyl etiopurpurin (SnET2),5 and mono-L-aspartylchlorin e6 (Npe6),6 are generally restricted by their drawbacks of poor solubility and photostability, and their low production of singlet oxygen (1O2) in the tumor hypoxic microenvironment.7 Therefore, it is still imperative to search for desired water-dispersible, highly photostable and efficient PDT agents, especially with high activity and biocompatibility under a hypoxia tumor microenvironment.
Fullerene-based nanomaterials have been applied in many areas, such as photoelectric devices,8 solar cells,9 and as MRI contrast agents.10 Furthermore, a new application of fullerene derivatives as excellent PS for PDT11 was studied due to its unique properties, including good biocompatibility, facile multiple surface functionalization, efficient generation of ROS under visible light illumination and total metabolism from a living organism.12 Very recently, we reported a carboxylic acid functionalized fullerene that exhibited excellent PDT properties under white-light illumination.13 As it is well known, the photodynamic activity of fullerenes can be further enhanced by conjugation with dye molecules14e.g. porphyrin or phthalocyanine, which are standards of traditional PSs and have a natural proclivity to accumulate in cancer tissues.15 Notably, the activity of most PDT agents is based on the concentration of oxygen in the tissues,16 while the hypoxic tumor microenvironment with its low oxygen level has brought down the PDT efficiency of these PSs. Viviana Rivarola's group reported a PS (porphyrin-C60) that could produce singlet oxygen under anaerobic conditions; however, the synthesized porphyrin-C60 exhibited poor solubility and a further formulation process with liposome was required for application.17
Herein, we have prepared an amphiphilic photosensitizer, trismethylpyridylporphyrin-C70 (PC70) dyad, which could form a ring-structure-like liposome by self-assembly. The as-prepared PC70 showed an enhanced absorption cross-section in the visible region, good water-dispersibility, high photostability, and favorable biocompatibility. Significantly, the present PC70 exhibited an extraordinary photodynamic effect even under hypoxic conditions upon light irradiation. These excellent properties enable PC70 to function as an improved PDT agent in low levels of oxygen. Moreover, a possible mechanism has been proposed by investigating the transient absorption spectroscopy of PC70 according to laser flash photolysis.
Results and discussion
Characterization of PC70 and D-TMPyP
D-TMPyP was prepared according to an established procedure,18 and the synthetic route of D-TMPyP is outlined in Scheme S1 (ESI†). D-TMPyP reacted with C70 through a one-step reaction to achieve C70-TMPyP, according to our previously reported method.19 After purification by flash chromatography, the chemical structure of the products was confirmed by 1H NMR (DMSO-d6) and MALDI-TOF-MS (α-cyano-4-hydroxy cinnamic acid as the matrix) (Fig. S1–S7†). The obtained final product was mixed with methyl tosylate and refluxed in an argon atmosphere and then passed through an anion-exchange resin repeatedly to yield trismethylpyridylporphyrin-C70 as a chloride salt (PC70). Note that the absorption of PC70 and D-TMPyP were investigated (Fig. 1A). The molar absorption coefficient of the Soret band of PC70 was less than that of D-TMPyP, it showed a slight red-shift, which indicated a partial electron density migrated from the D-TMPyP ring to the fullerene entity. As a result, the prolonged lifetime of the triplet of PC70 was observed, as shown below. The fluorescence spectra are investigated in Fig. S8 and S9.†20 The fluorescence intensity of PC70 was decreased compared to D-TMPyP, which indicated the interaction between D-TMPyP and C70. Under the irradiation of white light at 17 mW cm−2 for 10, 30, 60, 90, 120 or 150 min, the absorbance intensity of PC70 decreased slowly, whereas that of both D-TMPyP and PpIX decreased dramatically (Fig. 1B). This result indicated that PC70 possessed better photostability than D-TMPyP and PpIX. In addition, the 1O2 quantum yield of the PC70 was measured to be ca. 42% at white light (Fig. S10†) with Rose Bengal as the standard photosensitizer.

The diameters of the D-TMPyP and PC70 were measured by dynamic light scattering (Nano-ZS ZEN3600, Malvern Instruments, Germany). The hydrodynamic size of PC70 (ca. 90 nm) is smaller than that of D-TMPyP (ca. 220 nm) (Fig. 1C). This size would facilitate the PC70 to be taken up by cells. In addition, the zeta potentials (ζ) of PC70 and D-TMPyP were also measured (Fig. 1D). Only a minute difference of the ζ-potential of D-TMPyP and PC70 was observed. An appropriate size and zeta potential may lead to cellular uptake toward nanoparticles more easily.21
Most interestingly, the self-assembly of amphiphilic PC70 forms a ring circle structure similar to liposome, which was identified by transmission electron microscopy (Fig. S11†). The formed assembled structure exhibits a diameter of ca. 30 nm and may be further developed for drug delivery.
Comparison of cellular uptake of PC70 and D-TMPyP
The cellular uptake of sensitizer was evaluated by incubating 10 μM of PC70 with A549 cells at various time intervals.17 The uptake of D-TMPyP by A549 cells was tested in parallel as a control group. In each case, the concentration of intracellular sensitizer was measured by UV-vis absorption. PC70 was rapidly internalized into A549 cells in 3 h and reached a plateau after incubation for 8 h (Fig. 2A). The maximum uptake value of PC70 (∼20 nmol × 10−6 cells) was threefold that of D-TMPyP. This is due to the amphipathic property of PC70, which makes it more easily accessible across the cytomembrane.

Values represent mean ± S.D. of three separate experiments. 
Another experiment was explored to study the mechanism of the cellular uptake of PC70 nanoparticles by incubating the A549 cells with PC70 and ionic D-TMPyP at 4 °C and 37 °C, respectively. The results are shown in Fig. 2B, both PC70 and D-TMPyP showed more cell uptake at 37 °C rather than 4 °C. It was suggested that the cellular uptake of PC70 and D-TMPyP nanoparticles was energy-dependent.22 In particular, PC70 and D-TMPyP showed a selective uptake toward A549 cells in comparison with HaCaT cells (Fig. 2C), which may contribute to the tumor-targeting of the D-TMPyP moiety.23
Intracellular location study of PC70 in A549 cells
To confirm that PC70 was internalized into cells, the localization of PC70 in A549 cells was characterized by laser scanning confocal microscopy and D-TMPyP was used as a control. Both PC70 and D-TMPyP emit red fluorescence upon excitation at 405 nm. As shown in Fig. 3A, the red fluorescence was distributed in most of the cytoplasm, which indicated that PC70 mainly located in cytoplasm, but was not nonspecifically attached to the cell membrane. The red fluorescence of D-TMPyP was significantly quenched (Fig. 3B), which indicated that fewer D-TMPyP molecules were uptaken by A549 cells. This result is consistent with the previously reported results. For further confirmation, transmission electron microscopy (H-7650 TEM Hitachi Ltd., Japan) was carried out to characterize the intracellular distribution of PC70. As shown in Fig. 3D, PC70 (indicated by white arrows) was phagocytized into the cell as a small cluster and was mostly localized in the cytoplasm. In contrast, the control not treated with PC70 did not show any nanoparticles (Fig. 3C). This favorable uptake toward cancerous cells of PC70 would facilitate its PDT efficiency.

Photodynamic activity of PC70 under air conditions
According to the cellular uptake results, PC70 was internalized into the cells after incubation for 3 h. Upon light irradiation, PC70 with an extended π-conjugated system facilitated visible light absorption in the range from 400 to 700 nm and produced ROS to kill the cells. Importantly, the dark cytotoxicity of PC70 was negligible for both cancer cells and normal cells, indicating the favorable biocompatibility of PC70 (Fig. 4A). To investigate the photodynamic activity of PC70 against cancer cells, we studied the viability of A549 cells in vitro. After exposure to white light for 5 min, 10 min and 20 min at a power density of 17 mW cm−2, the cellular viability was detected. The results indicated that both PC70 and D-TMPyP (Fig. S12†) showed strong inhibitory effects on cell viability, even at a low concentration of 1 μM under light irradiation (Fig. 4B), and the killing efficiency can reach 98%. As expected, the cellular toxicity could be improved by extending the irradiation time and increasing the PC70 concentration (Fig. 4C), i.e., the photodynamic activity of the PC70 was dose- and irradiation time-dependent. Interestingly, cell death was accompanied by membrane bleb. As shown in Fig. 4D, blebs appeared on several cells after irradiation for 1 min. During irradiation lasting for 5 min, blebs appeared on most of the cellular membranes, and blebs also appeared on the nuclear membranes after irradiation for 10 min (Fig. S13†). These results were similar to our previous reported.13a

Photodynamic activity of PC70 under nitrogen conditions
Most of the PDT efficiency relies on the concentration of oxygen around the tumor tissues; however, the tumor microenvironment is usually hypoxic and acidic.24 As a result, the hypoxic tumor microenvironment significantly hinders the efficiency of the PDT. In order to illustrate thoroughly the PDT efficiency of PC70 under hypoxia, we further investigated the PDT efficiency of PC70 under anaerobic conditions with white light irradiation. After incubating with either PC70 or D-TMPyP, A549 cells were exposed to light under a nitrogen atmosphere. As shown in Fig. 5A, A549 cells in the presence of PC70 showed severe photodamage (80%), while D-TMPyP only showed limited damage (22%) to A549 cells. This result demonstrated that the PDT efficiency of PC70 was higher than that of D-TMPyP in a hypoxic environment. Furthermore, a confocal microscopy experiment was carried out. When the A549 cells were incubated with PC70, PI stained the cell nucleus transmembrane with red fluorescence, demonstrating that the cells damage severely (Fig. 5B). Moreover, most of the A549 cells treated with D-TMPyP were not stained by PI, indicating that D-TMPyP did not show a significant cytotoxicity to A549 cells under anaerobic conditions. The remarkable cytotoxicity of PC70 to tumor cells makes it potentially useful as an excellent photosensitizer, especially under anaerobic conditions.

(B) Confocal images of A549 cells stained with PI after treatment with 2 μM PC70 for 3 h and subsequently exposed to light irradiation for 10 min at a power density of 17 mW cm−2 in a nitrogen atmosphere.

Mechanistic study of the super photodynamic activity under nitrogen conditions
In order to understand why PC70 is more effective at killing cells than D-TMPyP under nitrogen conditions, a series of experiments were carried out. Free radical species detection was executed to identify which kind of ROS was produced by PC70 under light irradiation under the presence of different ROS scavengers.25 A549 cells were incubated with PC70 (2 μM) in the dark for 3 h, and then the medium was replaced by DMEM without phenol red, containing either 10 mM sodium azide (NaN3), mannitol, or SOD (50 units). Then, the cells were irradiated under white light for 10 min. The results in Fig. 6A and B indicate that both PC70 and D-TMPyP induced cell death as a result of the generation of 1O2 under air conditions. The photoirradiation experiments under the presence of different ROS scavengers were also carried out under nitrogen conditions. The results were similar to those under air-saturated conditions (Fig. 6C and D). Cells incubated with NaN3, mannitol, and SOD were used as controls (Fig. S14†).

(D) Viability of A549 cells incubated with 2 μM D-TMPyP for 3 h in the presence of different ROS quenchers upon light irradiation for 10 min under nitrogen conditions. The values represent mean ± S.D. of three separated experiments. 
To quantify the photosensitizing ability of PC70 and D-TMPyP in producing singlet oxygen, electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy was measured under air conditions and nitrogen conditions. 2,2,6,6-Tetramethylpiperidine (TEMP) was used as a radical scavenger.26 As shown in Fig. S15A and B,† under air conditions, little difference in PC70 and D-TMPyP was observed. However, after purging with nitrogen for 20 min, the ESR intensity treated with PC70 was reduced to half of the original. Meanwhile, that of treated with D-TMPyP nearly disappeared (Fig. S15C and D†), suggesting that PC70 produces ROS at lower oxygen levels more efficiently than D-TMPyP under hypoxic conditions.
Transient absorption spectroscopy based on laser flash photolysis was applied to detect the triplet excited state lifetime of D-TMPyP and PC70, which was associated with the photosensitizing efficiency of D-TMPyP and PC70 in producing singlet oxygen. As shown in Fig. 7, the temporal decay for the triplet absorption band at 480 nm was monitored.27 Under air-saturated condition, as shown in Fig. 7A, the triplet lifetime of PC70 (1.86 μs ± 0.01 μs) was slightly longer than that of D-TMPyP (1.64 μs ± 0.01 μs) under air-saturated conditions. Thus, it can be seen that there is no significant difference in the behavior of cell damage between PC70 and D-TMPyP under air-saturated conditions. However, under N2-saturated conditions, a distinctive triplet decay behavior was exhibited for PC70 and D-TMPyP, as shown in Fig. 7B. Unlike the D-TMPyP triplet, which had a single-exponential decay lifetime of 71.3 μs ± 0.5 μs, the PC70 triplet followed a second-order exponential decay with a lifetime of 62.8 μs ± 4.8 μs (32%) and 211.3 μs ± 7.0 μs (68%). The relaxation pathways of the PC70 triplet state, as illustrated in Fig. 7C, can reasonably explain the double-exponential result. The shorter lifetime of 62.8 μs, which was similar to the 71.3 μs of D-TMPyP, was assigned to the decay of the triplet state itself. In contrast, the longer lifetime of 211.3 μs can be assigned to the exciplex formed by energy transfer between the excited D-TMPyP and the ground state C70. The formation of exciplex may be due to the longer lifetime of the triplet, which has a larger probability to formed at a low oxygen concentration. It is the formation of exciplex that increases the triplet lifetime of PC70. Under low oxygen concentration conditions, the diffusion rate of oxygen is low, and the elongated triplet lifetime of PC70 makes it still possible to photosensitize the ground state of oxygen to produce singlet oxygen, whereas the shorter-lived triplet state of D-TMPyP had much less efficiency in photosensitization. This could explain why PC70 retains the PDT ability to kill cells under low oxygen concentration conditions.

Conclusions
In conclusion, the successfully synthesized photosensitizer (PC70) based on trismethylpyridylporphyrin-C70 dyad was investigated. The as-prepared PC70 performed good water dispersibility, high photostability, and favorable biocompatibility. Significantly, the present PC70 exhibited extraordinary photodynamic effects even under the hypoxia condition upon light irradiation. These excellent properties enable PC70 to facilitate the PDT of cells with lower levels of oxygen. Further investigations illustrated that the PC70 possessed an extremely long-life triplet state (211.3 μs) under hypoxia conditions, which enabled the exiguous oxygen enough diffusion time to reach the activated (3P-C70)* and for them to interact with each other to produce singlet state oxygen. This find makes PC70 promising as an improved PDT agent and especially can be used in the treatment of early- and late-stage cancers under shallow and hypoxia tissues.
Experimental section
Preparation and characterization of the water-soluble PC70 and the water-soluble trismethylpyridylporphyrin
Experimental details of the synthetic procedures and analysis of the characterization are given in the ESI.†

1O2 quantum yield measurement via a chemical method28
Water soluble disodium 9,10-anthracendipropionic acid (Na2-ADPA) was used as a 1O2 trapping agent, and Rose Bengal (RB) was used as a standard photosensitizer. In the experiment, 100 μL of Na2-ADPA solution (1 mg mL−1) was added into 1.5 mL of PC70 solution. The resulting solution was irradiated under white light (400–700 nm) at a power density of 10 mW cm−2. To eliminate the inner-filter effect, the absorption maxima of RB and PC70 were adjusted to about 0.2 OD. The absorption of Na2-ADPA at 380 nm was recorded at different irradiation time to obtain the decay rate of the photosensitizing process. The 1O2 quantum yield of PC70 in water (ΦPC70) was calculated using the formula below.ΦPC70 = ΦRB × KPC70 × ARB/(KRB × APC70)where KPC70 and KRB are the decomposition rate constants of Na2-ADPA by PC70 and RB, respectively. APC70 and ARB represent the light absorption by PC70 and the RB, respectively, which are determined by integration of the optical absorption bands in the wavelength range of 400–700 nm. ΦRB is the 1O2 quantum yield of RB and ΦRB = 75% in water. The measured 1O2 quantum yield of PC70 in water is ca. 42%.
Cell culture
The A549 cells and HaCaT cells were cultured with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Invitrogen, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone Company, South Logan, UT), penicillin (100 μg mL−1), and streptomycin (100 μg mL−1) (Gibco, Grand Island, N. Y. USA) in 5% CO2 at 37 °C in a humidified incubator.
Assays of the cellular uptake of PC70 and D-TMPyP
As mentioned above, an appropriate number of A549 cells (ca. 5 × 105 cells per cm2) were incubated with PC70 (10 μM) in the culture flasks at different incubation time points such as 3 h, 8 h and 24 h in the dark at 37 °C. Then, the culture medium was removed and the cells were washed several times with icy PBS solution. The cellular uptake was determined by adding 1.0 mL of 4% sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS, Merck) to the culture flasks, and subsequent incubating for 15 min in the dark at room temperature. The concentration of PC70 was evaluated by measuring the UV-vis absorbance at 428 nm. The concentration of D-TMPyP was examined under the same conditions but the UV-vis absorbance was measured at 422 nm. Each experiment was compared with a culture control without a photosensitizer. The same experiment was carried out to compare the cellular uptake of PC70 toward A549 cells and HaCaT cells through incubating for 3 h in the dark at 4 °C.
TEM observations
A549 cells were incubated with PC70 (2 μM) for 3 h and washed with Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS) to remove the noninternalized nanoparticles. The obtained cells were fixed with 4% glutaraldehyde and 4% paraformaldehyde overnight at 4 °C. Afterwards, the cells were centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 3 min, and washed with PBS (1 mM) three times. Then, the cells were post-fixed in 1% osmium tetraoxide for 2 h at room temperature in 1 mm3 masses. After being dehydrated by a graded series of ethanol and acetone, the cells were embedded in Epon812. Ultramicrotome (UC6, Leica Ltd. Co, Germany) was used to cut ultrathin sections, which were transferred onto 200-mesh copper grids, which were stained with uranyl acetate and lead nitrate, and then observed with a H-7650 TEM instrument (Hitachi Ltd., Japan).
PDT treatment and cell viability assay
Before being cultured in a 96-well plate for 24 h, the cells were counted using a cell counter to control the cell density at ca. 5 × 104 cells per cm2, and then incubated with PC70 for 3 h in the dark at 37 °C. After removing the culture medium, DMEM was added into the plate. The cells were subsequently irradiated with the M-visual light source (MVL-210, MEJIRO GENOSSEN, Japan) at 17 mW cm−2 for 10 minutes. Then, fresh culture medium was added to replace the aged one and the cells were cultivated for 24 h in the dark at 37 °C. The same procedure without irradiation was carried out to determine the dark toxicity. Cytotoxicity was evaluated by a WST-8 assay with a Cell counting Kit-8 (CCK-8; DOJINDO, Kumamoto, Japan), which has a characteristic absorbance at 450 nm. This was read with a 96-well plate reader (iMarkmicroplate reader, Bio-RAD, USA) to determine the cell viability. During the experiment, the D-TMPyP was used as a control.
Confocal images after staining with Dil and Hoechst 33258
First, A549 cells were incubated with different concentrations of PC70 and D-TMPyP at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 3 h, respectively. Then, the aged cell culture was replaced with fresh DMEM (without phenol red) and exposed to white light for 1 min, 5 min and 10 min, respectively, at a power density of 17 mW cm−2, and the cellular viability was detected. Afterwards, either Hoechst 33258 (1 mg mL−1) or Dil (1 mg mL−1) was added and incubated with the cells for 20 min before observation. The image was obtained by a FV 1000-IX81 confocal laser scanning microscope (Olympus, Japan).
Inhibition of ROS generation
A549 cells with a cell density of ca. 5 × 104 cells per cm2 were cultured in a 96-well plate for 24 h. To inhibit the ROS generation, the A549 cells were incubated with PC70 (2 μM) in the dark for 3 h, and then the aged medium was replaced by a fresh medium containing either 10 mM sodium azide (NaN3), mannitol, or SOD (50 units), and then the cells were irradiated under white light for 10 min. Afterwards, the medium containing free-radical scavenger was replaced. 1 day later, the cell viability was detected by CCK-8. Under the same conditions, several ROS scavenger (NaN3, singlet oxygen (1O2) quencher, mannitol, a hydroxyl radical (˙OH) quencher, and superoxide dismutase (SOD), a superoxide anion free radical (O2˙−) quencher) were used as controls.
Evaluation of radical scavenging ability by ESR spectroscopy
Studies on the radical scavenging by PC70 (10 μM) were performed by the spin trapping of 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine (TEMP). ESR spectra were measured with a Bruker ELEXSYSE 500 ESR spectrometer at 25 °C. Singlet oxygen was generated from light irradiation (50 mW cm−2), and D-TMPyP (10 μM) was used as a control. After purging with nitrogen for 20 min, the ESR intensity of TEMP containing either PC70 or D-TMPyP was also detected.
PDT treatment under anaerobic conditions
A549 cells were incubated with either PC70 (2 μM) or D-TMPyP (2 μM) in the dark for 3 h at 37 °C as previously described but in a nitrogen atmosphere, and then exposed to light irradiation for 10 min. The medium was replaced by fresh DMEM (without phenol red), and cell viability was detected by a CCK-8 after one day incubation. After removing the medium and washing by PBS several times, the cells were stained with propidium iodide (PI) (8 μM) for 15 min before observation. The images were obtained by a n-FV 1000-IX81 confocal laser scanning microscope (Olympus, Japan).
