DSSCs based on the ionic liquid and all-solid-state electrolytes were fabricated and characterized, without the addition of additives in the electrolytes. Compared with electrolytes containing the additive N-butylbenzimidazole (NBB), surface modification of dyed TiO2 photoanodes with cyanobiphenyl-based benzimidazole could enhance the values of the open-circuit photovoltage (Voc), short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) and the overall PCE of the fabricated DSSCs, due to the suppressed charge recombination rate, the conductivity optimization of the electrolytes and enhanced light harvesting capability at the TiO2 photoanode/electrolyte interface. Under the simulated air mass 1.5 solar spectrum illuminations at 100 mW cm−2, the fabricated devices achieved a cell efficiency of ∼6.63% and ∼5.82% for ionic liquid and all-solid-state electrolytes, respectively. These results provide an alternative strategy for high performance DSSCs with additive-free electrolytes.
Introduction
Much attention has been paid to dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), owing to their advantages of simple assembly technology, high power conversion efficiency (PCE), and relatively low manufacturing cost.1–3 Recently, a PCE over 12% (13.1% at 0.5 Sun) has been achieved by Yella and coworkers using a cobalt(II/III)-based tris(bipyridyl)tetracyanoborate complex as the redox mediator in combination with a custom synthesized donor–π–bridge–acceptor zinc porphyrin dye YD2-o-C8 and another organic cosensitizer Y123.3 In a DSSC device, photo-excitation of the monolayer sensitizer coated on the TiO2 films enables the injection of electrons into the conduction band of the oxide. The electrons cross the films and are collected by a charge collector into the external current circuit, and then return to the device through the counter electrode. The complete separation of the functions of light absorption, electrons and holes transfer allows much more favorable materials selectivity and optimization.3 However, the key point for efficiency enhancement is to restrain the interfacial electron–hole recombination. The additives added in the electrolytes have been considered as one of the most important components, with which significant improvement in the photovoltaic parameter of the DSSCs could be achieved.4–6 The influence of electrolyte additives, including 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP),7N-alkylbenzimidazole,8,9 benzimidazolyl functionalized ionic liquids,10 and other alkylpyridines or N-heterocyclic compounds4 has been extensively studied. In general, N-heterocycles could be effectively attached to the TiO2 surface via the N–Ti4+ interaction, and shift the conduction band edge of TiO2 toward higher energies and retard the interfacial electron recombination to increase the electron life time.4,7,11,12 Therefore, these additives could give significant improvement of the DSSCs with the high open-circuit photovoltage (Voc), fill factor (FF), and the high PCE.7 Actually, addition of the additive generally decreases the conductivity of the electrolytes and the diffusion coefficients of the redox mediator species containing the redox couples (such as I−/I3−), resulting in a decrease of short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc).13,14 Therefore, optimization of the electrolytes with high conductivity and diffusion coefficients of redox mediator species, however, without any additives, is highly desirable for the DSSCs.
In addition, surface passivation of TiO2 photoanodes by carefully optimizing and controlling the thickness of an ultrathin insulator layer, such as metal oxide,15,16 carbonates,17 organic silane18 or poly(methylsiloxane)19 has been applied to improve the performance in DSSCs.4,15–20 Recently, dendrons21 and metal–organic frameworks (MOFs)22 coated on TiO2 photoanodes also effectively enhance the device performance of DSSCs. Co-adsorbants, such as phosphonic acid and bis-(3,3-dimethy-butyl)-phosphinic acid23 and donor–acceptor type molecules,24 can also be applied for the surface modification of TiO2 photoanodes to assist favourable packing of dye molecules by avoiding aggregation.4 These surface passivation methods could suppress the electron recombination.
Due to their unique properties, cyanobiphenyl based liquid crystals (LCs) have been extensively studied and used as optical materials, such as in non-linear materials,25,26 display and photonic devices,27,28 chemical and biological sensors.29,30 The special and orientational direction of molecules at the molecular level and particular 3D network could provide effective pathways for the electroactive species to move freely.31,32 In addition, they exhibit a wide transparency range with an optical absorption,23,24 and light-scattering properties.33–35 Recently, the cyanobiphenyl-functionalized liquid crystal-based electrolytes have been used as the electrolytes with light-scattering properties for DSSCs. Photoelectrodes with enhanced light-harvesting properties could improve the device efficiency.36 However, the extra additives in the electrolytes are still indispensable even in these cases. This triggered our interest in exploring the possibility to fabricate the DSSCs with additive-free in electrolytes.
Here, for the first time, cyanobiphenyl-based benzimidazole was synthesized and applied for the surface modification of TiO2 photoanodes to increase the light-harvesting efficiency of photoanodes. DSSCs based on the surface modified TiO2 photoanodes, using ionic liquid and all-solid-state electrolytes were fabricated, without the addition of any other additives in the electrolytes. Photovoltaic measurements show that cyanobiphenyl-based benzimidazole modified TiO2 photoanodes could enhance the Voc, Jsc and the overall PCE values of the fabricated DSSCs, due to the suppressive charge recombination rate, the conductivity optimization of the electrolytes and enhanced light harvest capability at the TiO2 photoanode/electrolyte interface. Such an alternative strategy of surface modification of TiO2 photoanodes for the DSSCs with additive-free electrolytes could be applied to the most DSSCs to achieve high device performances.

Device fabrication
The fabrication of DSSCs was as reported previously.39,40 In brief, the cleaned FTO glass was covered at two parallel edges with an adhesive tape to control the thickness of mesoporous TiO2 film. Two layers of TiO2 particles were deposited onto cleaned FTO glass and used as photoelectrodes. A 10 μm thick film of 20 nm sized TiO2 particles was deposited onto the FTO glass electrode using the doctor-blade technique. The film was dried at 125 °C for 5 min. Then, a second 5 μm thick layer of 200 nm light-scattering anatase particles were coated on the top of the first TiO2 layer. The resulting TiO2 films were annealed at 500 °C for 15 min. After cooling to 80 °C, the obtained TiO2 electrode was immersed in 0.3 mM solution of Z907 in acetonitrile and tert-butyl alcohol at room temperature for 24 h. Afterward, the dye-sensitized TiO2 electrode was washed with anhydrous ethanol and dried with nitrogen stream. To prepare the Pt counter electrode, two drops of 5 mM H2PtCl6 in ethanol was placed onto the cleaned FTO glass substrate, followed by drying and annealing at 400 °C for 15 min.
Before the device fabrication of Devices C, D and G, 50 μL of 0.3 M NCHB (or NBB) solution in acetonitrile/dichloroethane (10:1, v:v) was filled into the porous dye-coated TiO2 photoanode. Then the solvent was evaporated under vacuum at 80 °C.
DSSCs were fabricated by sandwiching the completely melted electrolyte (80–100 °C) between a dye-sensitized TiO2 electrode and a pre-drilled Pt counter electrode by a 25 μm hot melt ring (Surlyn, DuPont). The resulting cells were placed at 80 °C in a vacuum to remove air and guarantee optimum filling and fine electrical contact. The produced devices were sealed with a Surlyn sheet and a thin glass cover by heating. The employed electrolyte for Devices A, C and D contains DMII/EMII/EMITCB/I2/GSCN (12:12:16:1.67:0.67), without NBB. While the reference electrolyte used for Devices B contains DMII/EMII/EMITCB/I2/NBB/GSCN (12:12:16:1.67:3.33:0.67), with NBB.9 The reference all-solid-state electrolytes for Devices E and G are composed of P1,4I:I2:succinonitrile (5:1:100),39 and with an additional 0.5 M NBB in the electrolyte for Device F.
Characterization and measurements

1H NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian 400 MHz spectrometer. The conductivity of electrolytes was characterized in an ordinary cell composed of a Teflon tube and two identical stainless steel electrodes (diameter of 1 cm) on a CHI660c electrochemical workstation at room temperature. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of the synthesized compounds were recorded on a Varian CP-3800 spectrometer in the range of 4000–400 cm−1. Absorption spectra of NCHB and the transmittance of the dyed TiO2 films without and with NCHB (illuminated from the FTO side) were observed with a UV Lambda 750 UV-vis/NIR spectrometer in the range of 350–800 nm. While, the reflectance of the dyed TiO2 films without and with NCHB (illuminated from the NCHB side) were recorded on the same spectrometer equipped with barium sulfate-coated integrating sphere. Thermal analysis was carried out on Universal Analysis 2000 thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA). Samples were heated from 50 to 500 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under a nitrogen flow. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements were performed under a nitrogen atmosphere with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 in a temperature range of −50–250 °C on a DSC-Q200. EIS measurements on a Tafel plots were recorded on a CHI660c electrolchemical workstation at room temperature in two-electrode mode of DSSCs. The EIS of devices were tested using a CHI660c electrochemical workstation. Under dark conditions, the bias voltage for the impedance measurement was −0.70 V and the frequency ranged from 0.01–105 Hz. The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves of the assembled DSSCs shielded by an aluminum foil mask with an aperture area of ∼0.1 cm2 were measured with a digital source meter (Keithley, model 2612) under simulated air mass (AM) 1.5 solar spectrum illumination at 100 mW cm−2. Incident photo-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) plotted as a function of excitation wavelength was recorded on a Keithley 2612 source meter under the irradiation of a Xenon lamp with a monochromater (Oriel CornerstoneTM 260 1/4). The photoelectrochemical parameters, such as the fill factor (FF) and power conversion efficiency (PCE) were calculated according to the previous reports.
Results and discussion

Scheme 1 shows the synthetic route, chemical structure and the thermal properties of N-6-(4-cyanobiphenyl-4′-oxy)hexyl benzimidazole (NCHB). The purity and chemical structure are confirmed by 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) (Fig. S1 and S2, ESI†) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). As shown in Fig. 1, a broad absorption peak at 2900 cm−1 is assigned to the stretching vibrations of N–H of benzimidazole rings.41 The stretching vibration belonging to the O–H group of 4-cyano-4′-hydroxybiphenyl is observed at about 3380 cm−1 (Fig. 1b).42 Compared with Fig. 1a, the sharp band at 2230 cm−1 (Fig. 1b–d) is indicative of the presence of the CN group.42 The relatively high melting point and decomposition temperature (>330 °C, Fig. S3, ESI†) of the compound indicate that NCHB could offer a high thermal stability, far beyond the operating temperature (50–80 °C) of the DSSCs.43

Fig. 2 shows the photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves for all the devices under simulated AM 1.5 solar irradiance at 100 mW cm−2. As shown in Table 1, the photovoltaic parameters of the DSSCs without (Devices A, C and D) and with (Devices B) the additive, N-butylbenzimidazole (NBB) in the electrolytes, respectively. Compared with Devices A and C, Device B with NBB as the additive in the electrolyte as previously reported by Grätzel shows a relatively higher cell efficiency (PCE = 5.98%),9 indicate that NBB could effectively improve the photovoltaic parameter of the DSSCs. However, Device C which was treated with NBB at the dyed TiO2 photoelectrode/electrolyte interface does not achieve a comparative efficiency in comparison to Device B, which might be due to the fast dissolution of NBB from the photoelectrode/electrolyte interface into the electrolyte to increase the electron recombination. On the other hand, NCHB is insoluble in the ionic liquid electrolyte applied in this work due to the anisometric molecules including van der Waals interactions and π–π stacking.44 Moreover, the employed electrolyte without NBB shows a higher conductivity of 9.06 × 10−4 S cm−1 than that of NBB-based electrolyte (8.52 × 10−4 S cm−1), which also leads to a higher performance for Device D. Therefore, addition of NCHB does not decrease the conductivity of the electrolyte, and Device D with the modification of NCHB at the dyed TiO2 electrode/electrolyte interface represents the best solar cell performance (PCE = 6.63%), which is much higher than that of the reference Device B (PCE = 5.98%), resulting in about 11% efficiency improvement. Furthermore, NCHB treatment can increase the light-harvesting efficiency of photoanodes as discussed below (Fig. 4). These results demonstrate the possibility of fabricating high performance DSSCs based on additive-free electrolytes.

Fig. 3 represents the incident photo-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) values of typical Devices A, B and D. The broad feature appears covering the visible spectrum range from 450 to 650 nm. The maximum IPCE values at 530 nm are 69%, 75% and 81% for Devices A, B and D, respectively. As previously reported,45 using a solar photon flux of standard AM 1.5 spectrum, a simple multiplication with the IPCE spectrum and the elementary charge will lead to a calculated Jsc value, which are consistent with the measured data, as shown in Table 2. It should be noted that liquid-based DSSCs showed slower response times than that of solid-state photovoltaics.4 The deviation of the measured Jsc values was acceptable since the filling of trap states should be responsible for the current response results because of the large internal surface of the photoelectrodes.46 In addition, low stead-state value of photo-induced current at large bias light intensity (1 Sun) will slight decrease the IPCE values, due to the ion transport limitation of the electrolyte.47

As shown in Fig. 4, the light-transmitting and light-scattering properties of the dyed TiO2 films were investigated. Compared with the film control, it is observed that coating a scattering of 200 nm TiO2 particles on the control film can reduce the transmittance and enhance the reflectance of TiO2 photoanodes. However, a small amount of light leakage through the scattering layer could be observed. Further addition of light scattering layers can reflect more visible light, however, cracks of TiO2 photoanodes during sintering processes could not be avoided.48–50 Here, the treatment of TiO2 photoanodes with NCHB could further decrease the transmittance and increase the reflectance of the TiO2 photoanodes (Fig. 4). Moreover, the low UV absorption of NCHB film (Fig. S4, ESI†) represents a wide transparency range with an optical absorption. Therefore, NCHB could effectively reflect the light of the dyed TiO2 film. The high reflectance in the visible light region indicates the multi-reflection of light in TiO2 film leading to an increase of light-harvesting efficiency of the photoelectrode. Therefore, the transmittance of the DSSC treated with NCHB at the photoelectrode/electrolyte interface is obviously lower than that without NCHB modification (Fig. 4c), demonstrating the sunlight harvest is enhanced by NCHB treatment, which results in the remarkable enhancement in device performance, including Jsc and IPCE as mentioned above (Table 1 and Fig. 3). A hypothesized operational scheme of such a device is shown in Fig. 4d.

Photovoltaic electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were further used to investigate the interfacial charge transfer processes of the DSSCs measured at −0.70 V in the dark,51–54 and the resistance values of devices were summarized in Table 3. Fig. 5a shows the typical Nyquist plots of EIS spectra of Devices A, B and D. From low to high frequency, three semicircles are observed in the Nyquist plots. R1, Rct, and R3 represent charge-transfer resistance at the counter electrode, the resistance of TiO2/FTO, TiO2/electrolyte interface, and the Nernst diffusion in the electrolyte, respectively.54 The semicircle in the intermediate-frequency region is larger, the electron recombination at the TiO2/electrolyte interface is weaker.54,55 Thus, higher Rct renders the suppressive electron recombination, which is favourable of the performance enhancement. The low values of R1 represent a favourable charge-transfer process for the reduction of I3− to I− at the Pt counter electrode/electrolyte interface. It can be seen that Device B shows higher R1 and R3 values than those of Devices A and D, indicating that the addition of NBB in electrolyte reduces the conductivity of the electrolyte, which is undesirable for performance improvement.

 Fig. 5  (a) Nyquist plots of EIS spectra and (b) Bode phase plots measured for Devices A, B and D at −0.70 V in the dark. 

Fig. 5b shows the Bode phase plots for the DSSC measured at −0.70 V in the dark. The frequency (fmax, the maximum frequency of the frequency peak) and the electron life time before recombination (τe) (Table 3) were calculated according to the following equation:56  
Compared with Devices A and B, the highest values of Rct (50.96 Ω) and τe (7.35 ms) were obtained for Device D, indicating that the adsorption of the dyed TiO2 electrode with NCHB could effectively reduce the electron recombination, leading to enhanced electron transfer and further improved cell performance. These results show good consistency with the previous J–V values, demonstrating that the treatment of dyed TiO2 electrode with NCHB is an efficient method for the high performance DSSCs without any additives in the electrolytes.
The long-term stability of the fabricated DSSCs was investigated via an accelerating aging test at 50 °C with successive one sun visible-light soaking shown in Fig. 6. After an accelerating aging test of 50 days, Devices A–D remained at 91%, 89%, 88% and 91% of their initial efficiency, respectively. All the devices retained almost over 90% of their initial efficiency in this period. However, Device C shows a sharp reduction of the PCE during the initial few days because of the dissolution of NBB from the dyed TiO2 electrode into the electrolyte to leading to increased electron recombination and resultant decreased cell performance. It should be noted that the Device D treated with NCHB at the photoanode/electrolyte interface still maintains almost 91% of its initial performance over 50 days, and also represents a good stability.

Application of NCHB is further extended to all-solid-state DSSCs based on N-methyl-N-butylpyrrolidinium iodide (P1,4I)-doped succinonitrile plastic crystal electrolytes, as reported by Grätzel.39 The J–V curves for Devices E–G are shown in Fig. 7, and the photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 4. Under the same experimental conditions, Device G, in which the dyed TiO2 photoanode is treated with NCHB, shows the highest PCE of 5.82%, much higher than that of the reference Device E (PCE = 4.87%), leading to an efficiency enhancement of 19.5%. In the Nyquist plots and Bode phase plots of all-solid-state Devices E–G shown in Fig. 8 and Table 5, low R1 values also represent an effective charge-transfer process relying on the I3−/I− redox couple for oxidized dye regeneration. Compared with Devices E and F, larger Rct (56.39 Ω) at the photoelectrode/interface and longer τe (7.44 ms) for Device G is also indicative of a more effective suppression of charge recombination by NCHB treatment. Furthermore, higher R3 value of Device F (12.23 Ω) than those of Devices E and G indicates that the addition of NBB in all-solid-state electrolyte reduces the conductivity of the electrolyte, which is unfavourable for performance enhancement. The solid-state electrolyte without NBB shows a higher ionic conductivity of 3.87 × 10−4 S cm−1 than that of NBB-based electrolyte (3.52 × 10−4 S cm−1), resulting in a higher performance for Device G. These results further confirm the conclusion that NCHB with light-scattering properties could successfully enhance the device performance of the DSSCs by a simple treatment at the photoelectrode/electrolyte interface.

As shown in Fig. 9a, a broad feature appears covering the visible spectrum range from 450 to 700 nm, and the maximum IPCE values at 530 nm are 64%, 70% and 76% for Devices E–G, respectively, which are consistent with the calculated data (Table 6). The long-term stability of Devices E–G was also investigated and the characterization data were presented in Fig. 9b. During the first ten days, the efficiency is moderately enhanced due to an increase of the regeneration of dye Z907 and thus an increase of Jsc.9 By the accelerating aging test, Devices E–G remained 93%, 90% and 95% of their initial efficiency, respectively, showing an excellent long-time stability. These results further confirm the conclusion that NCHB with light-scattering properties could successfully enhance the device performance of the DSSCs by a simple treatment at the photoelectrode/electrolyte interface.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we demonstrate herein a simple strategy for the fabrication of high performance DSSCs via covering modification of TiO2 photoanode surface with light-scattering functionalized cyanobiphenyl-based benzimidazole. Compared with the electrolytes containing NBB, surface modification of dyed TiO2 photoanode with NCHB could enhance the Voc and Jsc values and the overall PCE of the fabricated DSSCs because of the suppression of charge recombination, the conductivity optimization of the electrolytes and the enhancement of light-harvesting efficiency of the TiO2 photoanodes. This alternative strategy of surface modification could be applied to most DSSCs including quasi- or solid-state ones to achieve high device performances.
