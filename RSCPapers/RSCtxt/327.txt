    , Accepted 3rd December 2012First published on 18th December 2012AbstractWe propose a nano-fibrous polymer (NFP) film, fabricated by electrospinning poly(2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidinyloxy-4-yl methacrylate) (PTMA), as a key component in high performance organic batteries. The new strategy with a NFP film enables extraordinary rate capability and excellent cyclability, due to its special morphology. Moreover, the NFP film enhances the flexibility of the electrode at a low cost and prevents dissolution of PTMA into the electrolyte.
Introduction
The development of renewable energy resources together with more efficient technologies for energy conversion and storage is one of mankind's key challenges in science. The performance of energy conversion and storage technologies (fuel cells, batteries, solar cells, supercapacitors, etc.) needs to be improved to enable better use of intermittent renewable electricity sources and to develop sustainable transport solutions associated with the modern society. Moreover, portable electronic devices such as laptop computers and mobile phones are rapidly developed and, as a result, there is also a demand for continuous battery improvements that will enable longer operation times. The realization of both aims relies on developing energy storage devices that balance intermittent supply with consumer demand. In this area the lithium rechargeable battery has played a dominant role after the C/LiCoO2 concept was developed by Sony Corporation1 two decades ago, and it will continue do so for the foreseeable future due to its excellent energy density and cyclability.2
In spite of the success of the lithium battery in many applications, ranging from mobile phones to electric vehicles, there is still a need and room for improvement. New electrode materials and new electrolytes are needed in order to increase the power density, safety, and rate capability. In addition, with stricter environmental requirements, toxicity, recycling, and disuse of battery materials are becoming important driving forces for the realization of green batteries. By considering organic battery components there is potential for renewable and sustainable new lithium battery chemistries, e.g. by using biomass as a starting material and excluding rare and/or toxic metals in the electrodes.3
An early attempt to develop organic electrodes for lithium batteries was based on conducting polymers with delocalized π-electrons but these systems generally demonstrated low capacity and poor cyclability.4–6 Recently, carbonyl “based” organic materials such as anhydrides, quinones, phenylamine, phenylene, and polyimides have attracted attention in research on green rechargeable batteries.7–14 However, the electrochemical performance of carbonyl based materials is limited by a low potential, and they have, so far, shown poor rate capability. In 2002, poly(2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidinyloxy-4-yl methacrylate) (PTMA) was proposed by Nakahara et al.15 as an organic electrode for a rechargeable lithium battery and applied as a cathode in a flexible battery by Nishide.16–18 In PTMA the nitroxide radical 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxy (TEMPO) is the repeating unit, with low molecular weight (Mw = 30) per radical moiety and with the unpaired electron almost fully localized on the radical. The unit has a good chemical stability because of its resonance structures and strict protection of the radical centre.19 Compounds containing the TEMPO radical are known to show redox behavior in aprotic solvents in the range of about 3.7–4.0 V vs. Li/Li+ at low rates.20–23
In a battery the fast reaction kinetics of PTMA during the charge–discharge operations, with an estimated electron transfer rate constant of >10−2 cm s−1, leads to high power and rate capability with a theoretical cathode capacity of 111 mA h g−1.24–26 However, since PTMA is an insulator, a large amount, generally around 40 wt%, of conductive fillers, like carbon black, are used in the electrodes, substantially limiting the effective cathode capacity.15,24–27 For practical applications, it is essential to increase the active material content of the cathode. Accordingly, more recent studies focus on decreasing the carbon content in the cathode without losing the contact between PTMA and the carbon material in the cathode during cycling and, moreover, avoiding a decreasing rate capability.28–35
Another drawback of organic electrode materials is dissolution into organic electrolytes. The dissolution induces self-discharge and a short circuit of the rechargeable battery.14,16,33 The graphene and carbon nanotube (CNT) composite PTMA electrodes are able to improve the rate capability with an increase of active material, but they cannot prevent the dissolution of the active material.28,30 Some strategies have been reported in order to improve the stability of electrodes using crosslinking, brush and mesocellular carbon, etc.16,36,37 However, these designs have some difficulty enhancing the rate capability with a decrease of carbon conductor.
In this study a nano-fibrous PTMA film, fabricated by electrospinning, is proposed as a key component in a new strategy to maintain rate capability and cyclability with decreasing amount of carbon conductor. The nano-fibrous PTMA film exhibits excellent rate-capability as well as non-dissolution.
Experimental
NFP film preparation
PTMA was synthesized by the radical polymerization method. Purity >95% (TLC), in 90% yield, Tg ∼ 76 °C. 1H-NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3): H a: 1.18, H b: 1.20, H c: 1.87, H d: 5.23, H e: 5.98, H f: 5.61, H g: 1.87; IR (KBr) (cm−1): 2983 (s), 2941 (s), 2368, 1728 (vs), 1471, 1366, 1172 (s), 1006, 981. PTMA, P(VdF-HFP) (Kynar Flex 2801, Mw = 4.77 × 105), and carbon black were vacuum dried at 60 °C for 24 h before use. 50 wt% PTMA, 20 wt% P(VdF-HFP), and 30 wt% carbon black powder were added to acetone and N-methylpyrrolinone (1:1, w/w) solution. The materials were mixed by stirring and high energy ball milling for 2 h in an argon atmosphere. For electrospinning, a 14 wt% solution of PTMA, PVdF-HFP, and carbon black in a mixed solvent was used. Electrospinning was performed at room temperature with an applied voltage of 18 kV. The electrospun nano-sized fibres (NFP) were collected on an aluminium current collector and vacuum dried at 80 °C for 12 h before further use. The 6.0 mg NFP film was loaded on a 0.95 cm2 Al substrate for a coin-type cell.
Characterization and electrochemical evaluation

1H NMR spectra of the synthesized material were recorded on a Bruker 400 spectrometer (400 MHz for 1H) using CDCl3 as solvent. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) imaging and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) mapping were done using SEM-EDX (Philips XL30 S FEG). The size distribution of NFP was observed by transmission electron microscopy performed on a JEM-2010 JEOL. The electronic conductivity was measured with a Novocontrol broadband dielectric spectrometer. A NFP film based lithium battery cell was fabricated by stacking a lithium metal (300 μm thickness, Cyprus Foote Mineral Co.) anode and a NFP film cathode with a Celgard 2200 separator film. 1 M LiPF6 in ethylene carbonate/dimethyl carbonate (1:1 v/v) (Supplied from Samsung Co.) was used as the electrolyte. Electrochemical performance tests were carried out at room temperature, between 3.0 and 4.0 V, and at two different current densities: 10 (3.3 mA cm−2) and 50 C (16.5 mA cm−2) using an automatic galvanostatic charge–discharge unit – a WBCS3000 battery cycler (WonATech. Co.). The activation of porous films to prepare an NFP film and the fabrication of test cells were carried out in an argon-filled glove box under conditions of <10 ppm moisture level.
Results and discussion
PTMA was synthesized by the radical polymerization method. The synthesis steps followed are shown in Scheme 1 and described in a previous study.31 A 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine methacrylate monomer was polymerized by first using a 2,2′-azobisisobutyronitrile radical initiator and then oxidizing with H2O2 in the presence of NaWO4 catalyst to obtain PTMA. The nitroxyl radical of TEMPO is oxidized to form a cation and joins an electrolyte anion (here PF6−) to form an oxoammonium salt during the anodic stage. During the cathodic stage the reverse reaction occurs.15
 Scheme 1  Synthesis and redox process of PTMA. 
In the fabrication process of the NFP film, PTMA is dissolved in an organic solvent together with the binder poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (P(VdF-HFP)) and carbon black (Fig. 1). The gel-like solution is directly used in the electrospinning process and the resulting NFP film electrode based on PTMA is vacuum dried before application in a lithium secondary battery (see experimental details for further information). The NFP film was directly used as an electrode without additional processing, such as doping or coating. The 6.0 mg NFP film was loaded on a 0.95 cm2 substrate for a coin-type cell. When compared to literature data, it is demonstrated that a NFP film style cathode significantly improves the electrochemical properties of a lithium battery, even for carbon contents as low as 30 wt%.23–27,31–34 Poly(4-vinyloxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-N-oxyl) (PTVE), of similar molecular structure to PTMA, demonstrated poor rate capability with low contents of carbon fiber, but, however, Suguro et al. used only 15 wt% carbon.38 We believe that the NFP architecture is able to achieve a high capacity with low carbon content at high current density as the NFP film electrode exhibits stable and large reversible capacities, high Coulombic and energy efficiencies, and excellent rate capabilities. Moreover, the carbon black used in this system is beneficial due to its low cost compared with CNT, graphene, or carbon fiber.

Fig. 2 schematically illustrates the structure of the NFP thin film. The interlaying of the fibers generates a three-dimensional cobweb structure with fully interconnected pores, multi-fibrous layers and interstices between the ultra-fine fibers.39 The zig–zag interlaying of the NFP fibers on the substrate induces a highly porous micro-structure within the film, which eases penetration of the electrolyte and facilitates fast diffusion of the PF6− and electron. The internal carbon powder is covered with PTMA of 1–5 nm thickness, which corresponds to 1–6 monomers of PTMA.30 The external electron transfer is apparently delivered by the concentration gradient through an electron fast self-exchange between neighboring nitroxyl radicals.40 The electrons from the nitroxyl radical are driven to the inner carbon powder and the electron transfer is accelerated by homogeneous carbon connecting.
 Fig. 2  Structure and mechanism of NFP prepared by electrospinning. 
A SEM image of the NFP electrode (Fig. 3a) shows an interconnected network of fibres with a diameter distribution from 20 nm to 1 μm, with an average diameter of 50 nm. The fully interconnected micron-sized pores in the film are filled with an electrolyte. Arguably the interconnected nano-fibre network should facilitate the kinetics of ion diffusion. The TEM images (Fig. 3b and c) at higher magnification reveal that the carbon black phase of the fibre is located mainly in the centre of the fibre, and although distributed over the whole fibre volume, some aggregation of carbon black particles occurs. A thin film of ∼40 μm thickness was collected on an aluminum substrate and showed high flexibility. The zig–zag network of the NFP imparts sufficient mechanical strength for handling the electrode (Fig. 3d). The NFP film achieved 8.6 × 10−3 S cm−1 electronic conductivity without Al substrate. This value is much higher than the corresponding value of inorganic cathode materials.

The stability of the NFP film towards the liquid electrolyte is underlined by looking at the dissolution. Two electrode materials, pure PTMA and NFP films, were prepared and the conventional liquid electrolyte of 1 M LiPF6 in EC/DMC (1:1,v/v) was added under argon atmosphere. Fig. 4a shows the time evolution of the blends. PTMA is fully dissolved in the conventional liquid electrolyte after only 1 day. However, the NFP film does not dissolve into the electrolyte even after one week. Thus, the NFP film seems to prevent the dissolution problems of PTMA – at least during passive storage. We speculate that the robust property of the electrode is due to an aggregation between PTMA and PVdF-HFP during stirring and ball milling. A SEM-EDX mapping demonstrates an even distribution of elemental C, O, and N throughout the sample volume. Fig. 4b shows a SEM image of the NFP network and its corresponding EDX maps of carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen. Uniform element distribution of carbon, oxygen and nitrogen throughout the NFP can be seen clearly. Thus, it can be concluded that also the active substance of PTMA is evenly distributed in the fibre network.

Fig. 5 shows the electrochemical performance of a NFP based lithium battery (as described in the Experimental section), including voltage profiles (a) and cycle performance (b) at current densities of 10 C (6 min, 3.3 mA cm−2) and 50 C (1 min 12 s, 16.5 mA cm−2) in the range 3.0–4.0 V. During the first charge–discharge cycle, the NFP based battery exhibited a 3.6 V potential profile, even at these high rates, in agreement with previous low rate results of PTMA.15,27–35 When the cell was discharged to 3.0 V, capacities of 111 and 109.2 mA h g−1 were achieved at 10 and 50 C, 10 and 50 C, and the separation voltages (ΔV) were 0.03 and 0.04 V, respectively. From the voltage profiles it was also seen that the Coulombic efficiencies of the first cycles were 100 and 99.5%, respectively, and that the battery showed excellent energy efficiency, >98%, at both current densities. The volumetric capacities based on the electrode density were 178 and 175 mA h cm−3 at 10 and 50 C. The volumetric capacity is an important factor that needs to be considered in fabricating conventional batteries in industry, and the values of NFP film are much higher than other organic electrodes, although they are lower than a conventional inorganic electrode.9–16,20–38 The power capability of an insertion electrode material depends on the kinetics of the ion extraction–insertion process, which is coupled to the electron transport and the ion diffusion length.34,35 The interconnected NFP film electrode combines a short length for ion diffusion with a high electrical conductivity. Conventional PTMA electrodes, with high carbon black loading (>45 wt%), show a significant drop in the capacity and plateau voltage when cycled over 10 C.15,21,31–34 The retention of initial battery capacities with the NFP electrode were 98.5 and 90.6% after 150 cycles at 10 and 50 C-rates, respectively. This excellent cyclability, even at the very high current density, makes the NFP a prime candidate for a number of commercial applications.

Conclusions
We show that electrodes prepared in a nano-fibrous polymer (NFP) configuration by electrospinning PTMA can overcome previous limitations of organic electrodes and be a key component in an efficient and long lifetime green battery, up to very high charge–discharge rates (50 C). The excellent electrochemical performance is ascribed to the nanostructure that promotes fast ion transport through short diffusion pathways and at the same time facilitates electron transport. In addition, the NFP film increases the flexibility of electrodes and is advantageous from a cost perspective. The NFP film also prevents the dissolution of active material and increases the mechanical strength of a flexible electrode.
