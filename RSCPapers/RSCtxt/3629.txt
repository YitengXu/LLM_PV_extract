    , Accepted 24th January 2021First published on 25th January 2021AbstractA carrier-selective passivating contact is one of the main factors for the preparation of high-efficiency solar cells. In this work, a one-dimensional nanostructured CdS material combined with quasi-metallic TiN exhibits excellent contact performance with n-Si. In addition, the introduction of the CdS nanowire interlayer is more conducive to the extraction and transmission of electrons, which is attributed to a more suitable energy level alignment between the rear contact and the n-Si absorption layer. As a result, the power conversion efficiency of organic/Si solar cells based on the CdS NW/TiN/Al electron selective passivating contact exceeds 14.0%. This shows a promising technique to achieve high-performance and low-cost photovoltaic devices.
1. Introduction
Organic–Si hybrid solar cells which combine the low-temperature synthesis of organic materials and mature Si wafer manufacturing technologies are promising candidates for photovoltaic devices. In the past decade, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic–Si solar cells has been significantly enhanced from the initial 5.1% to exceed 18%.1–7 The rapid improvement of PCE is attributed to the effective suppression of optical and electrical losses through the light-trapping structure and the interface engineering of textured Si.8–17 However, the Schottky barrier caused by direct contact between the metal and semiconductor restricts the further improvement of photovoltaic device performance.18 The key to solving this problem is to develop a suitable rear contact for n-Si solar cells, which simultaneously achieves an excellent rear interface contact and passivation. Until now, there were mainly two methods: (1) inserting a thin electron transport layer (ETL) with low work function between the metal electrode and n-Si. Metal fluorides, low work function metals and organic polymers are generally considered as effective ETLs to improve electron collection efficiency.19–22 Although these ETLs can achieve lower contact resistivity (ρc), they have unsatisfactory results on c-Si surface passivation, which restricts the further increase of the open circuit voltage (VOC) of n-Si solar cells. (2) Passivating the surface state density at the n-Si/metal interface through an effective electron-selective contact (ESC). Metal oxides such as magnesium oxide,23 tantalum oxide,24 zinc oxide25 and titanium oxide,26,27 and metal nitrides such as tantalum nitride,28 titanium nitride29 and titanium oxynitride30 can form a satisfactory carrier selective contact with n-Si. This is mainly due to the thin silicon oxide (SiOx) layer formed between n-Si and these ESCs, which can passivate the c-Si surface to a great extent. The metal oxides or metal nitrides can passivate the silicon surface well, but low conductivity and inappropriate work function make it almost impossible to obtain low ρc, which restricts the fill factor (FF) of the devices.
In recent years, thermally stable quasi-metallic nitrides have attracted much attention as good doping-free carrier selective contacts. For example, in our previous work,31 TiN contacts prepared by reactive sputter processes have the dual functions of electron transport and hole blocking in photovoltaic devices, and have excellent contact performance. Although a high FF is obtained in photovoltaic devices, TiN cannot effectively eliminate silicon surface defects, which still limits the VOC of Si-based solar cells. As a critical direct wide band gap (∼2.4 eV) semiconductor, CdS is used as a buffer layer and an n-type layer to improve the lattice matching of the heterojunction interface, extend the carrier life and optimize the energy band alignment in CuIn1−xGaxSe2 (CIGS), Cu2ZnSn(S1−ySey)4 (CZTSSe) and Sb2Se3 solar cells,32–36 which ultimately leads to a significant improvement in device performance. Due to the single crystallinity, size limitation, and large surface-to-volume ratio of nanowires or nanorods, they have excellent optical, electrical and chemical properties. Therefore, solar cells based on nanoscale structures have been considered to be the most effective form.37–41 Moreover, a simple non-vacuum deposition process42–44 is sufficient to synthesize high-quality CdS nanowires or nanorods, which are suitable for the preparation of low-cost and high-efficiency photovoltaic devices. Although it is widely reported as the active layer in p–n heterojunction solar cells, the CdS nanowire film as an insertion layer or a passivating layer has rarely been reported.
Inspired by the electrical properties of CdS, herein CdS nanowires are inserted between the TiN contact and n-Si layer by a low-temperature spin-coating process. The combination of the CdS nanowire and TiN quasi-metallic material significantly reduces the contact resistance between the rear contact and n-Si to 20 mΩ cm−2, which is better than those of most reported ESCs. Moreover, the CdS nanowire layer optimizes the energy level alignment of the organic–silicon photovoltaic device. After inserting the CdS nanowire layer, the efficiency of the organic/Si solar cells reaches more than 14%. The device fabricated with the CdS nanowire interlayer showed an increase in the VOC and FF, resulting in much higher PCE.
2. Results and discussion
High-quality CdS nanowire films are beneficial for the improvement of the performance of photovoltaic devices. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze the structure and composition of the prepared samples in detail. Fig. 1a shows a low-magnification transmission electron microscope (TEM) image of CdS nanowires. It can be seen that the nanowire has a uniform geometry and a smooth surface, with a diameter of no more than 30 nm and a length of 3–7 μm. The HRTEM image in Fig. 1b shows that the lattice spacing is 0.207 nm, which corresponds to the (110) plane of the hexagonal CdS. The selected area diffraction (SAED) pattern in the inset of Fig. 1b can be recorded as the [2–20] axis of a hexagonal wurtzite structure. It can be speculated that the CdS nanowires are single crystals, which mainly grow along the c-axis. In the XRD patterns (Fig. 1d), all diffraction peaks can be attributed to wurtzite CdS (PDF#41-1049). The absence of other impurity phases indicates that the product has high phase purity. The energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) mapping (Fig. 1c) of the nanowire shows that the Cd and S signals are uniformly distributed. The obtained elements and atomic percentages are shown in the inset of Fig. S2.† The average contents of Cd and S elements are 47.67 at% and 52.36 at%, respectively, which accord with the ideal stoichiometric ratio. The high-resolution X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectrum of Cd 3d (Fig. 1e) shows the peaks of Cd 3d3/2 and Cd 3d5/2 at binding energies of 411.6 and 404.9 eV, respectively, representing the typical divalent Cd of CdS. The high-resolution S 2p spectrum (Fig. 1f) shows that S 2P1/2 and S 2P3/2 are two fitting peaks at 162.4 and 161.1 eV, respectively. In short, the synthesized CdS nanowires have a single crystal structure and good quality, which provide a good foundation for the preparation of high-performance devices.

The CdS nanowire films were prepared by spin-coating an ethanol dispersion on the back surface of n-Si, and the corresponding device structure from bottom to top is TiN/CdS NW/nanostructured Si/PEDOT:PSS/Ag grids (Fig. 2a). The SEM image of the nanostructured Si in Fig. S3† shows randomly distributed inverted pyramids. The effects of CdS nanowire films prepared under different spin-coating cycles on the performance of photovoltaic devices were studied. Fig. S4† shows the photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves of PEDOT:PSS/Si solar cells based on CdS nanowire layers with different spin-coating cycles. The corresponding photovoltaic parameters are presented in Table S1.† When spin coating is performed for 8 cycles, the photovoltaic device obtains the best efficiency and performance. Fig. 2b compares the typical light current J–V curves of the devices with three different rear contacts, and the relevant parameters are presented in Table 1. The control device with an Al rear contact exhibited a VOC value of 497 mV, a JSC value of 30.13 mA cm−2, and an FF value of 61.71%, with the corresponding PCE of 9.23%. When using a TiN/Al composite electrode, the device efficiency is increased to 12.83%, and the corresponding VOC, JSC and FF values are 578 mV, 32.57 mA cm−2 and 68.12%, respectively, while the device with a TiN/CdS nanowire/Al rear contact showed a VOC value of 625 mV, a JSC value of 32.92 mA cm−2, and an FF value of 68.26%, yielding a PCE of 14.04%. Satisfactorily, the VOC value of the device fabricated with CdS is as high as 625 mV, which is higher than those of most reported organic/Si photovoltaic devices with other intercalation layers,2,5,7,45–47 as shown in Table 2. The significant improvement in VOC and efficiency of devices based on the CdS insertion layer stems from the improvement of the quality of the rear interface, which will be discussed later. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the devices with different rear contacts are shown in Fig. 2c. The JSC values obtained from the EQE data of the three devices are 32.16, 32.34 and 32.50 mA cm−2, which are the same as the results of the J–V tests.

Fig. 2d shows the dark J–V curves of the devices with different rear contact electrodes. The device with the TiN/CdS NW/Al rear contact shows better diode performance. From the data in Table S2,† it is found that the I0 values of the device with Al and TiN/CdS NW/Al contacts are 7.37 × 10−7 and 1.37 × 10−8 A, respectively. The relation between I0 and VOC is given by the following equation: (1)where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is the temperature, and q is the charge of an electron. According to eqn (1), the value of VOC is directly related to the value of I0. A lower I0 will result in a higher VOC, which is consistent with TiN/CdS NW-based devices with higher VOC and lower I0. After introducing the CdS layer at the Si and TiN interface, the value of n decreased from 1.82 to 1.63, reflecting the reduction of carrier recombination at the interface between n-Si and the rear electrode. Fig. 2e shows the series resistances (RS) that were obtained from the dark J–V curves in Fig. 2d according to the following equation: (2)where Aeff is the device effective area. The RS value could be obtained by fitting the slope of the d(V)/d(lnJ) − J curve, which is presented in Table S2.† The RS value is reduced from 10.42 Ω cm2 for Al-based reference devices to 7.96 Ω cm2 for TiN-based devices. After introducing the CdS nanowire insertion layer, the RS value of the device is further reduced to 4.86 Ω cm2. The reduced RS results in a higher FF, which may further explain the higher FF of 68.26% in TiN/CdS-based devices.

Fig. 3 shows the photovoltaic parameter distribution of the devices with different rear contacts. The statistics come from a study of 10 solar cells. These results indicate that the preparation of carrier selective passivating layers has obvious advantages in terms of the performance characteristics of photovoltaic devices. It is obvious that devices with CdS/TiN/Al rear electrodes have higher average PCE than other types.

In order to evaluate the electrical properties of the n-Si/CdS NW/TiN structure, the contact resistivity was obtained by the method proposed by Cox and Strack.48 As shown in Fig. 4a–c, the device structures of Al/Si/Al, Al/Si/TiN/Al and Al/Si/CdS NW/TiN/Al are used to investigate contact resistance. If Al is in direct contact with n-Si, the I–V curve exhibits non-linear rectification characteristics. Non-linear rectification characteristics mean higher contact resistance, which is not conducive to electron transfer from n-Si to the Al rear electrode. When TiN is deposited on the n-Si surface, the I–V curve shows a quasi-symmetric trend. The weakening of the rectification characteristics of the device is mainly due to the electron transport and hole blocking effects of TiN materials, which have been explained in our previous work.31 However, the TiN/n-Si non-ohmic contact is likely to be restricted by the appearance of a metal-induced gap state on the n-Si surface caused by the quasi-metallic properties of TiN and the residual silicon surface defects at the interface. In contrast, wide band gap CdS nanowires are deposited between n-Si and TiN by a low-temperature spin-coating process, and Al/Si/CdS NW/TiN/Al devices show linear ohmic characteristics. The better device quality is mainly attributed to CdS nanowires providing satisfactory chemical passivation and electron tunneling capabilities. As a result, the value of ρc obtained using n-Si/CdS NW/TiN/Al (ρc ≈ 20 mΩ cm−2) is smaller than that of n-Si/TiN/Al (ρc ≈ 155 mΩ cm−2).

As shown in Fig. 5a and b, a scanning Kelvin probe microscope (SKPM) is used to observe the surface potential changes on the Si surface after coating CdS nanowires. The surface potential of the CdS nanowire layer on the silicon substrate was about 40 mV lower than that of n-Si. This potential difference is beneficial for the direction of charge transfer from the n-Si layer to the CdS layer. A suitable energy level alignment is a prerequisite for obtaining high-performance photovoltaic devices. The energetics of CdS were evaluated using cyclic voltammetry measurement are shown in the energy diagram in Fig. 5d. It can be seen from Fig. 5c that the onset oxidation potential (Eox) and the onset reduction potential (Ered) are located at A and B, respectively. The partial enlarged view of the cyclic voltammetry curve (Fig. S6a†) of the CdS nanowires shows that the value at point B is −0.8 V. The optical band gap diagram (Fig. S6b†) shows that the band gap of CdS nanowires is about 2.35 eV. Through simple calculation, the HOMO and LUMO energy levels are found to be −6.26 and 3.91 eV, respectively. All the optical and electrochemical properties of CdS nanowires are listed in Table S3.† The difference between the LUMO energy level and the n-Si conduction band position is very small, indicating that the charge recombination between n-Si and TiN contacts can be effectively suppressed. There is a large offset value (∼1.09 eV) between the HOMO energy level of CdS nanowires and the valence band of Si, which can effectively block holes. It can be clearly seen from the energy level diagram that after the introduction of the CdS nanowire layer, the device has better energy band matching, which may result in a higher VOC value of the device.

3. Conclusions
In summary, CdS nanowires are inserted between the TiN contact and n-Si layer by a low-temperature spin-coating process. The combination of the CdS nanowire layer and the quasi-metallic TiN material significantly reduces the contact resistance between the rear contact and Si, which improves the VOC and FF of the device. Besides, the CdS nanowire layer optimizes the energy level alignment of the photovoltaic device and may have excellent passivation ability. The PCE of PEDOT:PSS/nanostructured Si solar cells can reach more than 14.0%, with a VOC value of 625 mV. In the organic–nanostructured Si solar cell, a high value of VOC is obtained, which is attributed to the excellent rear interface contact of the device. Therefore, this work shows an effective strategy to manufacture photovoltaic devices with excellent performance through a simple route.
4. Experimental section
4.1. Synthesis of CdS nanowires
A simple and feasible solvothermal method was used to deposit CdS nanowires. In brief, 0.025 mol l−1 cadmium acetate dihydrate (Cd(CH3COO)2·2H2O, 99.99%), 0.05 mol l−1 sulfur powder (AR, 99.5%) and 0.1 g polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP, Mw 58000) were dissolved in an appropriate amount of ethylenediamine, and the reaction solution was stirred evenly and poured into a stainless-steel autoclave lined with Teflon. The autoclave was placed in a 200 °C oven for 8 h and then naturally cooled to room temperature. The yellow precipitate obtained by centrifugation was washed 6 times with ethanol and distilled water, and dried in an oven at 60 °C. Finally, a 0.15 g l−1 CdS nanowire ethanol dispersion was prepared for use.
4.2. Device fabrication
Single-sided polished c-Si wafers with a thickness of 500 μm were used to prepare solar cells. Initially, the Si wafer was cleaned with acid (HCl:H2O2:H2O = 1:2:5) and alkali (NH3·H2O:H2O2:H2O = 1:2:6) solutions. Then the clean Si substrates were immersed in an etching solution containing 0.2 mol l−1 silver nitrate (AgNO3, AR, 99.8%), 40 wt% HF and deionized water for 5 min at room temperature. Subsequently, they were washed with deionized water and immersed in a HNO3 solution for 10 min to remove any Ag residues. After immersing in a 10 wt% HF aqueous solution for 10 min to remove the oxide layer, the substrate was chemically etched with a 1 wt% tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH, AR) aqueous solution for 1 min to smoothen the textured Si surface. Before depositing PEDOT:PSS films, Triton X-100 and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, ACS reagent, 99.9%) were mixed into the PEDOT:PSS (Clevios PH1000) solution with doping ratios of 1% and 5%, respectively. The mixed PEDOT:PSS solution was coated on the polished n-Si surface at 3000 rpm, and then annealed under a nitrogen atmosphere at 120 °C for 20 min. A 500 nm thick Ag top electrode was deposited on the PEDOT:PSS hole transport layer using a thermal evaporation process, and a CdS nanowire film was coated on the backside of Si by a low-temperature spin-coating process. The result of the dispersion of the CdS nanowire film on the back of silicon is shown in Fig. S1a.† Finally, a 10 nm thick TiN film and 500 nm Al were deposited by magnetron sputtering. The thickness of the TiN film is determined by the ellipsometer test, as shown in Fig. S1b.†
4.3. Measurement and characterization
The J–V characteristics of organic/Si photovoltaic devices were measured using a Newport solar simulator, which was tested under standard conditions of 25 °C and 100 mW cm−2 illuminance. EQE spectra were measured using a spectral response measurement system. Optical contacts were obtained by GES-5 model ellipsometry. XPS spectra were characterized using a Thermo ESCALAB 250 instrument. TEM images were observed using a JEOL JEM-2010 electron microscope. The surface potential of the sample was determined using a commercial SKPM system (Bruker NanoScope 3D). For the cyclic voltammetry test, a three-electrode system was used to conduct the electrochemical measurements at an electrochemical workstation (CHI 660E). For more information on contact resistivity, KPFM and cyclic voltammetry measurements, refer to note 1, 2 and 3 of the ESI,† respectively.
