    , Accepted 16th September 2022First published on 20th September 2022AbstractConsidering the increasing heavy energy demands and severe environmental issues, researchers have been searching for an alternative renewable source of energy, aiming to achieve carbon neutralization. Biodiesel, which is deemed as an environment-friendly, sustainable, and renewable energy, has attracted extensive concerns worldwide with the merits of non-toxicity, biodegradability, and carbon-neutral nature. Generally, biodiesel is mainly produced via the transesterification of triglycerides and esterification of fatty acids with the assistance of highly effective catalytic material, which is determined to be a critical issue for biodiesel production. Benefiting from the superiorities of huge porosity, uniform pore size, controllable functional group, and excellent activity with stability, organic–inorganic hybrid porous coordination polymers (OIHPCPs) are considered to be promising catalysts for biodiesel production. However, limited reviews have concentrated on the specific application of OIHPCP-based catalytic materials for the production of biodiesel. With this, this study systematically reviews the current application of OIHPCPs in catalyzing the trans/esterification of liquid biomass for biodiesel production, including pristine metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), functionalized MOFs (i.e., acid, base, bifunctional, and enzymatic), MOF derivates, unconventional MOFs (UMOFs), and biomass derivate coordination polymers catalysts. Besides, the important impacts of trans/esterification parameters, such as the amount of catalyst, type and molar ratio of alcohol, reaction temperature and time, water and fatty acids content of the substrate, and auxiliary production technology of biodiesel are also comprehensively evaluated. Finally, the corresponding plausible reaction mechanisms and main conclusions together with future perspectives for OIHPCP applications in biodiesel production are further emphasized. This review is timely and conducive for advancing the bioenergy realms and achieving carbon neutrality.
1. Introduction
Nowadays, the rapid technological and economic development calls for an increase in the demand of fossil energy, while the non-renewable nature and huge demand of traditional fossil energy gradually exhaust it.1–4 Hence, looking for a kind of new, green, and renewable alternative energy has attracted extensive attention among relevant researchers all over the world.5–8 In addition, for the proposal of the development goal of “peaking carbon dioxide emissions by 2030 and achieving carbon neutrality by 2060”, it will further promote the shift in China's fossil energy utilization to new green energy, which will continue to strengthen the trend of low-carbon and the decarbonization of energy.9–11
There are many kinds of renewable energy sources that can support energy demand, which mainly including wind energy, solar energy, hydro energy, biomass energy, and geothermal energy.12–15 They are all important components of China's energy supply system and are of great significance for improving the energy structure, protecting the ecological environment, coping with climate change, and realizing sustainable economic and social development.16–19 Biodiesel, a mixture of long-chain fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) of great importance is regarded as a representative kind of green energy that is derived from renewable and sustainable biomass.20–22 Due to its pollution-free and renewable characteristics and suitable properties, it is expected to meet the world's energy demand and to be widely considered a promising alternative to fossil energy.23–26 Compared with conventional fossil energy, biodiesel has similar primary properties, which can be directly used for utilization in diesel engines.27,28 Furthermore, it exhibits significant benefits such as high combustion efficiency, ash point, with cetane number, lower CO2 emission, lower sulfur content, and better lubrication, implying its great application potential in terms of better combustion characteristics and lower emissions. More importantly, it is easier and safer for utilizing, storing, and transporting throughout the relevant procedure.29–32 The comparison of the main physicochemical properties between biodiesel and fossil diesel is shown in Table 1.33,34

Globally, the output of biodiesel has been rising rapidly, wherein the total output of biodiesel increased by 13%, reaching 47.4 billion liter by the end of 2019. According to the Renewables 2020 Global Status Report, Indonesia took the lead as the largest country producer, accounting for about 17% of the global market, followed by the United States (14%) and Brazil (12%).35 Generally, the raw oils for biodiesel production with a high concentration of free fatty acid (FFA) and water are unfavorable for industrial production. Considering this, a series of high-quality edible oils such as soybean oil, rapeseed oil, sunflower oil, and coconut oil are generally used for biodiesel production, while they normally account for 70–95% of the total cost of production.36,37 To circumvent this issue, effective biodiesel production from cheaper non-edible oil and waste cooking oil is recognized as a preferable option. In fact, different countries have adopted diverse raw oils to produce biodiesel in combination with their respective resources and crop advantages. Accordingly, the main feedstocks used in different countries are listed in Table 2.38–43 Domestically, rapeseed oil is determined as the major feedstock for biodiesel production, and the projected utilization of biodiesel in 2020 was as high as 2 million tons.44

Frequently, biodiesel (fatty acid methyl ester, FAME) is synthesized by transesterification or esterification in the presence or absence of catalysts,45,46 wherein catalysts can be divided into two categories, namely, homogeneous and heterogeneous.47 Despite the relatively low cost, short reaction time, and high yield, homogeneous catalysts usually suffer from some inevitable defects, such as the easy corrosion of production equipment, laborious separation and recycling, and severe environmental pollution. Hence, many efforts have been made to develop promising heterogeneous catalysts with outstanding activity, effortless separation, and good reusability.48–51 Organic–inorganic hybrid porous coordination polymers (OIHPCPs) are important types of hybrid materials connected by covalent bonds between metal atoms and organic ligands, which mainly include metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) and some other peculiar porous coordination polymers. OIHPCPs possess a series of very favorable properties that are beneficial for the preparation of biodiesel, such as high specific surface area, high porosity, easy functionalization, and more importantly, excellent catalytic activity and stability.52,53 The common synthesis methods of OIHPCPs mainly include the solvothermal method, hydrothermal method, volatilization method, and diffusion method. Moreover, some new synthesis methods have also been reported recently, such as electrochemical, microwave, and mechanical synthesis.54–56 In the last decades, much attention has been paid to the research on the production of biodiesel based on burgeoning hybrid porous coordination polymers as catalysts. Fig. 1 shows the increasing trend of published research papers in the field of biodiesel and MOFs in the past decade.
 Fig. 1  Number of publications on biodiesel (A) and MOFs (B) per year (data were obtained from the Web of Science on July 1st, 2022). 
The preparation of efficient, green, and sustainable catalysts is of great significance for the industrialization of biodiesel production. Intending to provide applicable guidance and information for the manufacture of novel heterogeneous catalysts of high-efficiency, this paper systematically reviewed the current application of OIHPCPs in trans/esterification for biodiesel synthesis, as shown in Fig. 2. Although some good review works concentrated on biodiesel synthesis using MOF-based catalysts have been reported,57–59 however, the research on specializing MOF-based catalysts for biodiesel production is still insufficient. Specifically, in Fang's work,57 Basumatary's work,58 and Li's work,59 although MOF-based catalyst applications to produce biodiesel were basically described, long or short. The slightly less restrictive aspect is that they ignored the interesting kinds of MOF-based catalysts (i.e., unconventional MOFs based on phosphonate ligands and biomas-derived coordination polymers). Moreover, the reaction mechanisms of transesterification and esterification reactions with OIHPCPs were reinforced in the paper.

To the best of our knowledge, there is no comprehensive review on the specific application of OIHPCPs catalytic materials in the biodiesel industry, showing that it is imperative to advance the realms of their ecofriendly applications. In this regard, in addition to MOF-based catalysts, MOFs derivatives, UMOFs, and biomass derivatives coordination polymers were also included in this review to provide a more comprehensive perspective on the application of OIHPCPs in biodiesel production. Meanwhile, feasible catalytic mechanisms and the impacts of the reaction parameters were also emphasized.
2. Trans/esterification mechanism
As shown in Fig. 3, biodiesel is usually obtained by the transesterification of triglycerides and methanol, or the esterification of FFAs and methanol.60
 Fig. 3  Schematic illustration of biodiesel production through the transesterification of triglyceride and esterification of FFAs. 
Generally, Brønsted bases exhibit outstanding activity for the transesterification of triglycerides, while Brønsted acids are regarded as highly-effective catalysts for the esterification of FFAs.46,61 The possible transesterification mechanism catalyzed by the Brønsted base is illustrated in Fig. 4(a), which is a key step for the Brønsted base to accept the protons of methanol to form methoxy anions with high chemical activity. Methoxyanion attacks the carbonyl carbon atom of the triglyceride to form a tetrahedral intermediate, which is then decomposed into a fatty acid methyl ester.62–64 In contrast, the reaction mechanism of Brønsted acid-catalyzed esterification is shown in Fig. 4(b). The protons first combine with the carbonyl group of FFAs to form carbon cation intermediates. Protophilic methanol combines with carbon cations to form a tetrahedral intermediate, which is then dehydrated to form FAME and generates protons to catalyze the next round of reaction.64–66

In addition to the Brønsted base, the Lewis acid and base are also capable of catalyzing the transesterification reaction. As shown in Fig. 5(a), bearing a resemblance to the Brønsted base catalytic process, the nucleophilic attack on the aliphatic carbonyl group was realized by activating methanol with the Lewis base site to form a tetrahedral structure. The generated alkoxy anion obtains the H atom, and the Lewis base generated at the same time continues to catalyze the next reaction.67,68 While the transesterification catalyzed by the Lewis acid site is completed by interacting with the catalytic site and ester oxygen, finally removing the alcohol and Lewis acid site, which could be used for consecutive catalysis (Fig. 5(b)), and as for the esterification reaction, just replacing the OR2 group with the hydroxyl group.68–70

3. Application of organic–inorganic hybrid porous coordination polymers in biodiesel production
Benefiting from the large specific surface area, high porosity, and easy functionalization, hybrid porous coordination polymers with high catalytic activity are considered promising catalysts for biodiesel production. This section mainly introduced the application of pristine MOFs catalysts, functionalized MOFs catalysts, MOF-derived catalysts, UMOFs catalysts, and biomass-derived coordination polymers catalysts in biodiesel synthesis.
3.1 Pristine MOFs catalysts
MOFs are special coordination polymers with a periodic network structure, formed by inorganic metal ions as connection units, organic ligands interconnected by self-assembly, and strictly regular nanopores and cavities are defined, which are similar to the structure of the zeolite (Table 3).71–73 The catalytic activity of Al2O3, MOF-808, MIL-125, and ZIF-8 for oleic acid esterification was compared by Zhou et al. Benefiting from the stable supported porous framework ensured by the strong interaction between the metal ions with organic ligands of MOF catalysts and more accessible Lewis acid sites of higher activity, ZIF-8 showed the highest catalytic activity under the conditions of 130 °C, 0.1 g oleic acid, 1 mL methanol, and 10 mg catalyst. Accordingly, the yield of methyl oleate was about 90%, proving that MOFs have a fine application prospect for biodiesel catalysis.74

Besides, Cu- and Ca-based MOF synthesized by solvothermal and hydrothermal processes was developed by Unza Jamil et al. to investigate biodiesel production from waste cooking oil. The characterization implied the successful synthesis of cubic MOF crystals with good thermal stability, large specific surface area, and unique mesoporous. Moreover, the coordination of more unsaturated active sites derived from the binding of Cu MOF + Ca MOF promoted the activation of methanol and triglycerides, providing a high yield of 85% after the process parameters were optimized via response surface methodology (RSM), which was better than single Cu-MOF (78.3%) or Ca-MOF (78%). In terms of the MOF stability, a slight decrease of 7% was found after 3 runs, which might be attributed to the leaching of Cu and Ca active sites and deposition of impurities on the catalyst surface.75 Considering the abundant FFA of raw Calophyllum inophyllum oil, T. M. M. Marso et al. adopted chromium(III) terephthalate (Cr-Tp) and cobalt(II) terephthalate (Co-Tp) as heterogeneous acid catalysts for pre-esterification, leading to a significant reduction (88%) in the acid value. Followed by the transesterification of pre-esterified oil with methanol in the presence of 1% KOH (by weight of oil), 93% yield of biodiesel with no saponification under mild conditions was reported. In this research, it was disadvantageous to directly use a homogeneous base catalyst for substrate oil with a high acid value. Pre-esterification before transesterification could effectively reduce the acid value, avoid saponification, and improve the yield under mild conditions.76 Alternatively, unlike T. M. M. Marso's two-step reaction, another MOF, Zn3(BTC)2 (BTC = 1,3,5-benzenetricaboxylic acid), was fabricated by Lunardi et al. to prepare biodiesel from degummed palm oil (DPO) via one-step trans/esterification, and the highest FAME yield was 89.89% under the optimized reaction conditions.77 It was reported that Zn3(BTC)2 emerged as a triclinic structure, possessing a large specific surface (1176 m2 g−1) and reasonable thermal stability (up to 300 °C), as well as a mass of macropores and mesopores, which made it available for macromolecular substrate contacting with the Lewis acid catalytic site (Zn2+) and promoted mass transport. The proposed mechanism for one-step trans/esterification is shown in Fig. 6; it could be seen that the proposed mechanism was consistent with the Lewis acid catalytic mechanism in Fig. 5, unsaturated Zn2+ center acted as Lewis acid for the coordination with oxygen, promoting the convergence and nucleophilic attack (no attack) between methanol and DPO, thereby facilitating the trans/esterification. It is worth mentioning that there was no obvious decrease in yield and leaching of the active sites after three consecutive cycles. In a similar way, Pangestu et al. synthesized rod-like MOF crystals by coordinating Cu2+ with BTC and applied them to the preparation of biodiesel from palm oil. Also, a high FAME conversion rate of 91% together with acceptable recyclability was obtained.78

In another precedent, MOF-5, an important member of the MOF family, was employed to prepare biodiesel from nonedible oil. Despite the fine conversation yield of 82.0% from waste cooking oil, a sharp decline in activity was observed, which was claimed to be relevant to the liberation of Zn, thus indicating the significance of a stable structure.79 Among various MOFs, the Zr-based UiO series exhibits outstanding stability in thermal, chemical, and mechanical properties. In addition to that, the Zhou research group claimed that the connection defects of UiO-66 played a major role in the catalytic activity as the absence of organic ligands led to more Zr active sites. In this regard, a series of UiO-66 with different defect amounts were successfully synthesized by changing the synthesis temperature or terephthalic acid/ZrCl4 ratio. The results demonstrated that UIO-66 synthesized at lower temperature and molar terephthalic acid/ZrCl4 ratio had more connection defects, which promoted the transesterification of tributyrin and soybean oil with methanol, and obtained an equivalent yield of other solid acid catalysts.80 Although UiO-66 has unsaturated metal active sites, its catalytic performance can be further improved by functional chemical groups. F. G. Cirujano reported that the content of the Lewis acid site of UiO-66-NH2 after amino group functionalization was about half that of UiO-66. However, UiO-66-NH2 showed better activity, benefiting from the synergistic action of Lewis acid and a basic amino group. To be specific, the connection between –NH2 and H improves the nucleophilicity of the alcohol, and the connection between Zr and O improves the electrophilicity of the carbonyl carbon (Fig. 7b), suggesting that the catalytic activity of MOFs could be improved by grafting chemically active groups.81

3.2 Acid-functionalized MOF catalysts
Generally, pristine MOFs as catalysts for biodiesel production would have the defects of chemical instability and lack of active sites. However, MOFs can be used as matrixes to support the active sites.82 Introducing active substances into MOFs by impregnation, encapsulation, and covalent linkages can significantly improve the catalytic activity of MOFs.83,84 Among them, acidic solid catalysts have been widely investigated because of their outstanding tolerance to the FFAs and free water in low-quality feed oils (Table 4).

Impregnation is a relatively simple and effective method to load functional groups into MOF structures. By impregnation, p-toluenesulfonic acid and methanesulfonic acid were introduced into UiO-66(PTSA/UiO-66 and MSA/UiO-66, respectively). It was reported that the crystal structure of the prepared heterogeneous acid catalysts had not changed. With palmitic acid and methanol as the substrates, the catalytic activities of PTSA and MSA supported by UiO-66 were significantly higher than those supported by activated carbon, whose better catalytic performance of MOFs could be attributed to the significantly higher porosity and specific surface area (1058.9 m2 g−1, 1.79 nm). More importantly, the active metal Lewis acid sites (Zr4+) and Brønsted acid sites (–SO3H) in the MOF skeleton were determined as the crucial reasons for its outstanding activity. Accordingly, the yields were 97.1% and 97.0%, respectively, and the activity basically remained after five cycles, confirming that employing MOF as the carrier to load active sites is an effective strategy.85 Similarly, Liu et al. prepared MF-SO3 by functionalizing MIL-100 with dilute sulfonic acid. After sulfonation, the original MOF structure was almost unaltered, and thanks to the abundant Brønsted and Lewis acid sites of MF-SO3, a yield of 95.86% was obtained.86 Another sulfonic acid-functionalized MOF catalyst, MIL-101(Cr)-SO3H, prepared by one-step hydrothermal synthesis, exhibited excellent activity in oleic acid esterification and butanol vapor phase dehydration. After sulfonation, the specific surface area decreased significantly from 3015 m2 g−1 to 1801 m2 g−1, the pore volume decreased from 1.82 cm3 g−1 to 0.92 cm3 g−1, but the acid density increased to 1.62 mmol g−1. In particular, with the assistance of a microwave, the yield obtained in merely 20 minutes was equivalent to that obtained by conventional heating for 10 h.87
Polyoxometalates (POMs) are a vital category of metal–oxygen clusters formed by the connection between early transition metal ions and oxygen, possessing strong acid strength and unique redox properties,88,89 while the issues of high solubility and small specific surface area in polar solvents often lead to an unsatisfactory catalytic performance in biodiesel synthesis.90,91 Hence, the strategy of immobilizing/supporting POMs on porous MOF materials has attracted extensive interest. For example, 12-tungstophosphoric heterology acid (HPW) with a Keggin-type structure was successfully encapsulated in MIL-100 through the one-pot reaction of HPW ferric nitrate and trimellitic acid, and the as-prepared HPW@MIL-100(Fe) was used for the esterification of n-hexanol and acetic acid. The characterization techniques proved that HPW molecules with intact proton acidity were incorporated into the mesoporous cage of the MIL-100(Fe) framework as a non-coordination guest. Because the molecular size of POM was larger than that of the MOF framework, the issues of leaching could be dismissed. Also, a yield of 96.3% was obtained due to the synergistic effect between HPW and MIL-100(Fe).92 Similarly, by incorporating phosphomolybdic acid (PMA) into Fe-BTC, Zhang's research group fabricated PMA/Fe-BTC by a facile one-pot synthesis method. Due to the active species (PMA), large specific surface area, and good thermal stability, the yield was 72.3% in the reaction of methanol and oleic acid.93 Moreover, the esterification of oleic acid and methanol catalyzed by Zr-doped silicotungstic acid supported on Fe-BTC and UiO-66 (ZrSiW/Fe-BTC and ZrSiW/UiO-66) was investigated. The possible mechanism was depicted in Fig. 8; it could be seen that methanol attacked the carboxylic acid activated by ZrSiW/MOF and is finally dehydrated to synthesize biodiesel. According to the catalytic mechanism, acidity played an important role in the catalytic process. Due to the high acidity of ZrSiW and the stable structure of MOFs, the yields of ZrSiW/Fe-BTC and ZrSiW/UiO-66 still reached 79% and 88.9% after 6 cycles. The higher yield of ZrSiW/UiO-66 might be attributed to the more stable UiO-66 structure.94 Another example of UiO-66-based MOF-encapsulated POMs was reported by Zhang et al., wherein specifically, instead of direct assembly, they probed a two-step high-temperature formation of Zr6(OH)4O4(Ac)12 and low-temperature self-assembly of PW12@UIO-66(PW12 = H3PW12O40). The as-prepared PW12@UIO-66 exhibited outstandingly in terms of stability, the biodiesel conversion of the tenth cycle was equivalent to the fresh one, and the activity could even be maintained for 4 weeks.95 Magnetic materials can be effectively recovered by an external magnet, thus avoiding centrifugation or filtration operations. In this case, magnetic high-efficiency solid catalyst (H6PV3MoW8O40/Fe3O4/ZIF-8) was synthesized by adding ZiF-8 into Fe3O4 nanoparticles and then encapsulating vanadium-substituted heteropolyacid (H6PV3MoW8O40) (Fig. 9). Benefiting from the strong interaction between heteropolyacids and imidazole groups in ZIF-8, the active acid sites were stably supported, and the porous structure provided more accessible active centers and mass transfer. As a result, in addition to showing good magnetism, H6PV3MoW8O40/Fe3O4/ZIF-8 gave a yield of 92.6% and decreased slightly after 5 runs.96 Furthermore, Zhang et al. investigated a precedent of embedding Ce-BDC with immobilized HSiW into UiO-66(Zr). In addition to introducing favorable high acid sites, the average pore size of the Ce-BDC@HSiW@UiO-66 composite hybrid material was also optimized from 2.58 nm to 3.42 nm, thus facilitating the mass transfer of oleic acid, and an oleic acid conversion of 81.5% together with outstanding recyclability was reported.97

Furthermore, ionic liquids (ILs) with adjustable structures can be exchanged with the POMs anion to further modify POM-based MOF materials. In this regard, Xie et al. prepared two analogous, efficient, and green catalysts AILs/HPW/UiO-66-2COOH98 and AIL/HPMo/MIL-100(Fe),99 respectively. Therein, AILs/HPW/UiO-66-2COOH was prepared by functionalizing UiO-66-2COOH with POMs via in situ synthesis and then adding sulfonated acidic ionic liquid to the prepared POM/UiO-66-2COOH composites, and IL, POMs, and MOF composites were constructed by POMs anion exchange (Fig. 10). The as-prepared AILs/HPW/UiO-66-2COOH was reported to have both Brønsted sites from ILs and Lewis acid sites from POMs, and under the optimum reaction conditions, the yield of biodiesel reached 95.8%. It is worth mentioning that it could still maintain high activity even in low-quality substrates containing 9% FFA and 3% water.98 The other catalyst based on MOF, POMs, and ILs was prepared by Wan et al. and named as [SO3H-(CH2)3-HIM]3PW12O40@MIL-100; when utilized for the esterification of oleic acid and ethanol to prepare biodiesel, the yield was 94.6%.100 In addition, Chen et al. embedded HPW guest molecules into larger MIL-101(Cr) cages by simple impregnation, and then realized robust encapsulation by grafting sulfonic acid ionic liquid with HPW to generate a larger heteropoly ionic liquid, wherein the Brønsted acid came from the ILs, and Lewis acid in the MOFs was identified as the main active sites. At the same time, the uniform distribution of active sites and the retained mesoporous were also responsible for the effective esterification of oleic acid.101
 Fig. 10  Synthesis procedure of the AILs/HPW/UiO-66-2COOH catalyst.98 
In addition to utilizing POMs as connecting bridges to realize the heterogeneity of ILs, ILs can also be introduced into MOFs by connecting the unsaturated metal ions in MOFs. [(CH2COOH)2IM]HSO4@H-UiO-66, fabricated by approximate ligand substitution, exhibited excellent catalytic activity in the esterification of oleic acid with methanol. As depicted in Fig. 11, propionic acid etching was employed to remove partial ligands in MOF, resulting in more exposed defects, followed by bidentate coordination between the –COO− group and two portions of unsaturated Zr ion. Ultimately, [(CH2COOH)2IM]HSO4@H-UiO-66 was synthesized through the addition reaction of ionic liquid and sulfuric acid. Due to the similarity between the ligand of ILs and the original MOF ligand, stable Zr–O bonds were formed, and the generated Brønsted-Lewis acid sites endow it with satisfactory activity. The mechanism of Brønsted-Lewis acid synergistic catalysis is shown in Fig. 12; taking advantage of the nucleophilicity of methanol hydroxyl oxygen, the formation of tetrahedral intermediate was promoted with the assistance of Brønsted-Lewis acid sites, followed by dehydration to form FAME. Also, the reaction conditions were optimized by RSM, under the conditions of 10.39 molar ratio, 6.28% catalyst amount, and 5 h; the yield of 93.82% was obtained and can be reused six times without a significant loss of activity.102

Impregnation-reaction-encapsulation strategy was exploited by the Guan research group to encapsulate dicationic acid ionic liquids (DAILs, 1,4-bis[3-(propyl-3-sulfonate)imidazolium]butane hydrogen sulfate) into the MIL 100(Fe) framework. In a similar way, the Brønsted acid of ILs and Lewis acid sites of MIL-100(Fe) were key factors in the 93.5% biodiesel yield.103 Another IL (1,4-butanediyl-3,3′-bis(3-sulfopropyl)imidazolium dihydrogensulfate, DAIL)-based magnetic catalyst DAIL-Fe3O4@NH2-MIL-88B(Fe) reported by the Guan research group was fabricated through the strong interaction between NH2 of amino-functionalized MOFs and -SO3H groups of DAIL. Due to its outstanding acidity (1.76 mmol g−1), spindle morphology, and superparamagnetism, 93.2% ethyl oleate yield could be obtained; besides, it showed no obvious loss of activity after six runs and could be separated under the action of magnetic force without obvious mass loss.104 Instead of modifying MOFs (MIL-101(Cr)) supporters with functional groups, Han et al. reported that electron-rich SH groups were capable of being introduced into the backbone of 2-mercaptobenzimidazole ILs to confine ILs through S–Cr coordination bonds. Due to the presence of abundant highly active ILs enriched on the surface of the MIL-101(Cr) framework, 91.0% conversion of oleic acid was attained under the optimum reaction conditions. Nevertheless, about 10% yield reduction was observed due to the leaching of ILs and the blockage of the MOF channel.105 As illustrated in Fig. 13, Peng et al. fabricated UiO-66 solid superacids grafted with different ILs via the quaternization of UiO-66 with 1,3-propane sulfonic acid and ion exchange with H2SO4 or HSO3CF3. The as-prepared UiO-66 solid superacids were qualified with outstanding acid concentrations (3.33 mmol g−1), super acidity, and unique microporous structure, which were demonstrated to be able to accurately activate methanol. In the process of transesterification, methanol was adsorbed in the internal pores of solid acids and activated by the acid sites, followed by being captured by the surface tripalmitate via diffusion. It was worth mentioning that this pattern of methanol transportation in the pores was claimed to be faster and more effective. As a result, UiO-66 solid superacids exhibited remarkable catalytic activity.106 Developing novel ILs with higher acidity and more sites is of great significance to endow MOFs with better activity. Accordingly, an interesting trisulfonic ILs was effectively confined in amine-functionalized UiO-66 via the intense acid–base interaction of –NH2 and –SO3H. However, the apparent reduction of specific surface area and pore blockage was observed, which further implied the connection of ILs, good wettability, and novel ILs with high acidity, which enabled a satisfactory oleic acid conversion of 96.86%.107

In addition to the abovementioned, there were some other functionalized reagents used for introduction into MOFs, for example, MnO2,108 TiO2,109 and (NH4)2SO4.110 As reported by the Sahar Dehghani research group, an interesting catalyst based on MCM-41 prepared by an ultrasound-assisted impregnation/hydrothermal hybrid method gave the high biodiesel conversion of 96.9%.111 Acid catalysts can simultaneously catalyze transesterification and esterification to produce biodiesel. It can be concluded that the reaction conditions of MOF-based acid catalysts are normally more stringent, but their favorable catalyst structure, stable acidity, and wider scope of application have led to extensive investigations.
3.3 Base-functionalized MOF catalysts
Along with acid-functionalized MOFs, some active base-functionalized MOFs were also developed as catalysts for biodiesel production (Table 5). A typical strategy is to immobilize an alkaline reagent on MOF supporter. For instance, guanidine, a strong organic base, was bound on ZiF-90 via imine condensation reaction to develop a novel catalyst for the transesterification of soybean oil.112 Benefiting from the superior physicochemical properties of ZiF-90-Gua (i.e., high alkalinity, large specific surface area, and good stability), a conversion of 95.4% was reported under the optimal reaction conditions of 65 °C, 6.0 h, 15:1 methanol/oil molar ratio, and 1 wt% catalyst dosage. According to the catalytic mechanism proposed in the research (Fig. 14), imine as the active site improved the electrophilicity of carbonyl carbon, promoting the adsorption of methanol, thus facilitating the transesterification reaction, and the alkalinity was closely related to the catalytic performance.

 Fig. 14  The proposed mechanism for the solid base-catalyzed transesterification.112 
As illustrated in Fig. 15, another effective magnetic recyclable solid catalyst fabricated by the Xie research group (Fe3O4@HKUST-1-ABILs) was evaluated by the transesterification of soybean oil with methanol.113 It composites with a magnetic core and a porous metal–organic framework shell fabricated through a versatile layer-by-layer assembly method, which ensured its favorable catalytic structure together with providing sites for the subsequent immobilization of ILs, and then basic ILs were encapsulated within the core–shell magnetically responsive material via the coordination of unsaturated metal and lone pair on N atom. On assessing its catalytic activity, 92.3% yield was received. Moreover, it exhibited strong magnetic properties, which assisted it in maintaining a conversion of about 90% after being reused 5 times. On the other hand, Chen's research group argued that nitrogen-based MOF synthesized directly frequently showed unsatisfactory basicity on account of the competitive coordination between the N sites and metal ions. Accordingly, two post-synthesis methods were utilized to prepare amine-modified MOF catalysts, specifically, the coordination of unsaturated metals and the covalent grafting of organic ligands with 2-dimethylaminoethyl chloride.114 This post-synthetic modification method significantly improved the alkalinity and realized the conversion of more than 99% triglycerides. Furthermore, research revealed that macromolecular glyceryl butyrate exhibited a worse biodiesel conversion rate, which suggested that the reaction was carried out in the porous framework of MOFs, and the large molecular volume was not conducive for the interaction with the catalytic site. Nonetheless, the above modification means frequently required a relatively laborious synthesis procedure. Hence, exploiting efficient catalysts simply and conveniently is highly preferable. In this manner, Abdelmigeed et al. reported an undemanding process of NaOH impregnation on ZIF-8; to facilitate recovery, magnetite was added to fabricate NaOH/magnetized ZIF-8 composite catalyst. Impressively, the complete conversion of FAME was realized under the optimized reaction conditions; however, significant NaOH leaching was observed due to the weak support mode, which was ameliorated by calcination at 200 °C for 4 h.115
 Fig. 15  Synthesis procedure of the Fe3O4@HKUST-1-ABILs catalyst.113 
Fazaeli et al. investigated biodiesel production from soybean oil catalyzed by ZIF-8 doped with sodium and potassium (KNa/ZIF-8).116 Despite the significant enhancement in the alkalinity after adding Na, the alkalinity was further improved after partial sodium ions were substituted by potassium ions, especially in the medium and strong alkaline sites. Under the conditions of 100 °C, 10:1 molar ratio, and reaction time of 3.5 h, the yield reached 98% and could be recycled at least three times. Under the same reaction conditions, the yields of Na/ZIF-8 and ZIF-8 were 86% and 11%, respectively, indicating that after functionalization, the catalytic performance of MOFs is greatly enhanced. In addition, compared with the traditional carrier (SiO2) and other MOFs (MIL-101 and MIL-100) materials modified by Na and K, KNa/ZIF-8 demonstrated higher catalytic activity. Similarly, Fazaeli et al. added graphene oxide (GO) into the ZiF-8 skeleton and doped sodium and potassium as well, and the as-prepared KNa/ZIF-8@GO exhibited consistent activity.117 Due to the high conversion rate and mild reaction conditions in a short time, the industrial production of biodiesel is usually in an alkaline environment.118 However, compared with acid functionalization, base-functionalized MOFs need further research.
3.4 Bifunctional MOF catalysts
Possessed with both alkaline and acidic active sites, bifunctional catalysts can play a synergistic role in the reaction steps for biodiesel production (Table 6).119 As reported, UiO-66-NH2,81 a typical bifunctional catalyst equipped with –NH2 and Zr, was used in the esterification of lauric acid and methanol, giving a yield of over 99%. Similarly, another bifunctional catalyst based on UiO-66 was fabricated by Ahmed S. et al. It was claimed that UiO-66(Zr)-NH2-green was prepared by a green method and exhibited a high conversion of 97.3% together with good reusability. Moreover, due to the presence of –NO2 with great electronegativity, which would increase the positive electricity of Zr, UiO-66(Zr)-NO2-green theoretically had better acidity than UiO-66(Zr)-NH2-green, while its poorer catalytic performance indicated that the synergistic effects from two diverse sites had positive impacts on oleic acid esterification.120 Unlike the commonly used impregnation121 or encapsulation methods,122 chemically-bonded catalysts normally exhibit better stability, while anchoring amino sites in organic MOF ligands can provide media for subsequent chemical grafting. As shown in Fig. 16, an interesting Schiff base Zr coordination catalyst was fabricated by the condensation of salicylaldehyde with amine groups anchored in organic ligands, followed by the tetradentate coordination of Zr with [O, N, N, O] (Zr-salen). Under the synergistic assistance of two Lewis acid sites (Zr, Cr) and Schiff base, 74.1% conversion of methyl oleate was observed; more importantly, this stable coordination pattern and robust skeleton maintained a yield of 73.6% after 6 cycles. In particular, limited literature on catalysis by bimetallic multi-sites has been reported, and this Zr(IV)-Sal Schiff base complex could be regarded as a feasible and highly promising direction.123

Likewise, by anchoring amino sites in MOFs in advance, a novel bifunctional acid catalyst HPW/UiO-66-NH2 was developed by Tan et al. via electrovalent assembly and applied to the transesterification of high acid value (21.5 mgKOH g−1) non-edible Euphorbia lathyris L. oil with methanol, obtaining a high yield of 91.2%.124 Utilizing the inherent organic ligand imidazole in the ZIF-8 framework, heteropolyacid could also be successfully chemically covered on the ZIF-8 through a strong O–N hybrid bonding, thus avoiding the amino grafting of UiO series MOFs (Fig. 17). The as-prepared ZIF-8@HPA showed typical core–shell morphology, and the electrostatic effect of O from the heteropolyacid (HPA) shell and N from MOF allowed it to maintain a stable structure in the transesterification process of rapeseed oil. More interestingly, the addition of different concentrations (0.05, 0.1, 0.3, and 0.5 g) of heteropolyacids also gave it adjustable acidity and alkalinity. According to NH3-TPD and CO2-TPD, the most favorable HZN-2 (corresponding to 0.1 g heteropolyacid concentration) exhibited a total acidity of 17.44 mmol g−1 and total alkalinity of 15.03 mmol g−1. As a result, an exciting yield of 98.02% was reported due to imidazolate (base sites), HPA, and some Zn in ZIF-8 (acid sites) and after five runs, the activity was barely lost.125 Because of the abundant lipid content, short growth cycle, and high photosynthetic efficiency, microalgae are widely considered a new generation of substitutes for biodiesel production, especially in the current era when the problem of food shortage is becoming increasingly prominent.126,127 In this context, an HPA-modified bifunctional catalyst based on ZIF-67 was developed for biodiesel production from microalgal lipids with 17% FFA content. The interaction between HPA and imidazolate ligands destroyed partial Co–N bonds, generating more unsaturated Co cations (Lewis acid) and N− extremities (Lewis base), thus leading to the satisfactory conversion efficiency of 98.5%.128 In addition to HPA, another interesting bifunctional catalyst with ILs confined by ionic bonds between the SO3− of ILs and the NH2 of IRMOF-3 was investigated by Cheng et al. for microalgal biodiesel production. It was reported that the introduction of ILs optimized the original microporous structure, bringing about a mesopore-dominated framework, which was conducive to the mass transfer of lipid molecules. More importantly, with the benign assistance of enhanced total acidity and acid–base synergistic catalysis, a high FAME conversion efficiency of 98.2% was obtained.129 Bifunctional catalysts can make up for the defect that alkaline catalysts cannot be applied to substrates with high acid value. Also, they showed excellent catalytic activity, relatively mild conditions, and favorable applicability to the one-pot reaction. Nevertheless, it is still of great challenge to maintain the robust immobilization of two hostile acid–base active sites and avoid activity leaching.

3.5 Enzymatic MOF catalysts
The transesterification for biodiesel can be conducted under mild conditions with better selectivity in the presence of enzymes (Table 7). Moreover, the purity of the obtained biodiesel is usually higher, and the process is green and ecofriendly.130,131 However, the poor stability and recyclability limit the application. To deal with these issues, the immobilization of enzymes on stable porous supporters has been widely investigated.132,133 From a comprehensive view, Tan and his co-workers reviewed the strategy of lipase immobilization and the application of lipase confined on different nanomaterials in biodiesel production, for example, nanoparticles, nanofibers, carbon nanotubes, graphene, and MOFs. It turned out that MOF-supported enzyme catalysts exhibited excellent characteristics due to their rigid skeleton and adjustable aperture.134 Adsorption, encapsulation, and covalent bonding are common immobilization strategies.135

The adsorption method, a frequently-used and efficient loading method, can load the enzyme onto the MOF through weak interaction without considering the molecular size of the enzyme.136 On account of this, BCL-ZIF-8 was synthesized by immobilizing Burkholderia cepacia lipase (BCL) onto ZIF-8 by the adsorption technique. The yield achieved was 93.4% in the transesterification of soybean oil and ethanol, and the activity recovery was enlarged 12-fold compared with free lipase activity.137 Based on the same MOFs and enzyme, Cheong et al. reported BCL@An-ZIF-8 using amine-functionalized ZIF-8 physically adsorbed BCL. Over 80% of its initial hydrolysis and transesterification activity was maintained after at least 10 runs due to the multipoint connection between An-ZIF-8 and lipase through a hydrogen bond, confirming that amino modification was beneficial to the stabilization of the enzyme.138 As illustrated in Fig. 18, an interesting catalyst containing polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) hydrophobic protective layer was prepared by chemical vapor deposition (CVD), followed by Aspergillus oryzae lipase (AOL) hydrophobic adsorption. According to the activation mechanism of the enzyme catalytic interface, when the enzyme is at the hydrophobic interface, the conformation of the enzyme converted from closed-form to open-form with the movement of the polypeptide chain (lid). Here, hydrophobic enzyme supporters were conducive for exposing more active sites and decrease the aggregation of the byproducts on the catalyst surface. In terms of its activity and stability, AOL@PDMS-ZiF-L retained 90% of its initial activity after 150 days of storage, while free AOL retained only 20%. Besides, a yield of 94% was acquired under the optimized reaction conditions. After 5 cycles, the catalyst showed excellent stability with a yield of 85%.139 Another Aspergillus niger lipase (ANL) immobilized hydrophobic supporter (UiO-66-PDMS) was reported by Hu et al.; in particular, the influences of the hydrophobic layer on enzyme immobilization were investigated in detail. By adjusting the CVD treatment time, a series of carriers with different hydrophobicity was obtained; with 6 h CVD treatment, ANL/UiO-66-PDMS-6 h gave a yield of 88% at 24 h with great recyclability, which might be due to the existence of the hydrophobic layer that made the enzyme molecules more inclined to be adsorbed on the surface, thus maintaining the completed active structure together with improving the tolerance to methanol.140 Normally, it is impracticable to confine macromolecular enzymes into the microporous/mesopores of general MOFs by diffusion. However, Du's research group fabricated macroporous MOFs (M-ZiF-8) by the hard template method to realize the pore diffusion of ANL and applied it to the alcoholysis of soybean oil with methanol to prepare biodiesel. Through the study on the relationship between reaction time and FAME yield, the yield of traditional ANL/ZIF-8 was higher in a short time due to a large number of enzymes adsorbed on the surface, but with the extension of time, soybean oil, and methanol molecules could enter the macropores and contact with the active center. Owing to this better space utilization, the enzyme activity of ANL@M-ZIF-8F was 6.5-fold higher than ANL/ZIF-8.141 Moreover, the Du research group further reported a magnetic macroporous Thermomyces lanuginosus lipase (TLL) supported on an M-ZIF-8 catalyst with high efficiency and easy recovery by adding Fe3O4. The results showed that magnetic modification did not inhibit the loading and activity of the enzyme, and could significantly improve the reusability of the catalyst.142 This relatively facile and convenient adsorption method could avoid damaging the overall structure of the enzyme, but maintaining the stable immobilization of the enzyme is a long-term challenge.
 Fig. 18  Schematic illustration of the preparation process of AOL@PDMS-ZIF-L and AOL@ZIF-L.139 
Compared with adsorption, encapsulating enzymes in MOFs can efficiently avoid enzyme leaching. However, the volume of the enzyme is larger than the pore size of MOFs, which makes direct embedding unrealistic.143,144 Considering this, in situ encapsulation is frequently utilized on account of averting damage to the overall structure of the enzyme. Li's research group reported a novel catalyst lipase@Bio-MOF that encapsulated thermophilic lipase QLM into MOF via biomimetic mineralization (Fig. 19). Lipase@Bio-MOF was claimed to be more bio-friendly due the adoption of naturally rigid adenine ligands that offered abundant N and O sites for metal coordination. For its activity, an initial FAME conversation of 80.9% was observed, and acceptable biocatalytic activity was found in terms of a yield over 60% without any changes in morphology and crystal structure after five runs.145 Felicitously, a novel synthetic strategy “bottle-around-a-ship” was adopted by Tangestaninejad et al. to develop lipase@ZIF-67, and the conversion reached 78% under the optimum conditions.146 In addition, Rhizomucor miehei lipase (RML) was encapsulated into an X-shaped ZIF-8 via a one-step encapsulation method, leading to a biodiesel yield of 95.6%. Significantly, it was reported that the favorable attraction between the lipase and imidazole ligand in ZIF series skeleton contributed to the biomimetic mineralization of MOF, promoting the transformation of the enzyme to the open-form conformation and exposing more active centers. Considering this, exploring more biological enzyme-friendly organic ligands would have positive impacts on the stability and activity improvement of enzyme-immobilized MOFs.147

Another way of enzyme immobilization covalent bonding is to connect the enzyme with the material through covalent bonds, which is widely considered to be a relatively more stable and effective loading mode, but it might inevitably damage the original structure of enzymes. In this manner, an interesting fibrous nanostructures Zr-MOF/PVP (Polyvinylpyrrolidone) polymers were developed by Arastoo et al., then purified lipase from Enterobacter cloacae MG10 was confined on it. Biodiesel production from R. communis oil could reach up to 83%.148 Benefiting from magnetic Fe3O4 nucleus and the lipase from Candida rugosa covalently immobilized externally by amide linkage, the prepared Lipase-Fe3O4@MIL-100(Fe) presented excellent conversion (92.3%) and recyclability in the transesterification of soybean oil and methanol.149 In summary, lipase catalysts possess abundant merits: high purity products, mild reaction conditions, environment-friendly process, suitable for low-quality substrates, etc. However, further research is still required to achieve a more stable immobilization of enzymes without restricting activity, in particular, the relatively higher cost of enzymes might become another intractable obstacle to their future industrial production.
3.6 MOF-derived catalysts
In addition to the hard template method,150 high-temperature calcination and carbonization are also capable of optimizing the pore size limitation of MOFs (Table 8). However, the insufficient tolerance of MOFs to an exorbitant temperature usually makes them unable to maintain their initial structure, but their calcined derivative still inherits the porous structure and molecular level adjustable characteristics of MOFs; moreover, the metal ions in MOFs could be transformed into active metal oxides.151 Among diverse MOFs, MIL-Fe(100) was extensively employed as a precursor due to the satisfactory magnetism of the calcined derivative; incidentally, magnetic material produced by this in situ calcination decreases the agglomeration formed by dipole mutual attraction. Considering this, Li's research group reported a series of examples of carbonized MIL-Fe(100)-loaded metal oxides, one was that carbonized MIL-Fe(100) (Fe@C) supported active SrO heterogeneous alkaline catalyst, and after carbonization, the Fe@C was endowed with magnetism and a larger pore size, which was more conducive for the access of macromolecular oil substrate. The effects of SrO loading and calcination temperature on the activity were investigated; under the saturated 30 wt% SrO loading condition, the activity calcined at exorbitant temperature decreased due to crystal sintering and massive agglomeration. The best basicity of Fe@Ce–Sr achieved was 7.94 mmol g−1, and the conversion of biodiesel was 98.12% in the transesterification of palm oil and methanol.152 In addition, Li's research group also probed the catalytic performance of (NH4)2SO4-impregnated carbonized MIL-Fe(100) in the esterification of oleic acid and methanol, and the as-prepared CIS demonstrated an exciting 95.68% conversion of methyl oleate without a significant loss of the circulation activity.153 Unlike the carbonization of MIL-Fe(100) and then supporting SrO, SrCO3 was firstly immobilized on MIL-Fe via mechanical mixing and in situ titration, and then calcined in N2 atmosphere to fabricate MM-SrO, and ST-SrO. The obtained catalyst was used in the transesterification of palm oil and methanol with a high yield of 96.19%.154 Compared with SrO, CaO possessed a wide range of sources and lower cost; in line with this, Li's research group proposed that calcium acetate and MIL-Fe(100) were utilized as precursors, followed by calcination at 750 °C nitrogen atmosphere (CAM 750). The characterization technique confirmed the two-step decomposition process from calcium acetate to calcium carbonate and then to calcium oxide, which further combined with Fe3O4 and Fe2O3 to form the main active center Ca2Fe2O5 and CaFe3O5, leading to the total basicity of 2.66 mmol g−1. Similarly, the expansion of micropores to mesopores after calcination was also conducive to increase mass transfer, and the saturation magnetization of 112 emu g−1 allowed it to be easily recovered by external magnetism. Despite the 95.07% conversion of the fresh catalyst, a significant activity loss was found in the fourth operation that was subsequently proved to be induced by the accumulation of organic matter rather than the leaching of calcium.155

To the best of our knowledge, few researchers have focused on the activity of inherent defects of MOFs after calcination. Lately, Guo and his coworkers reported two similar novel bifunctional magnetic high-efficiency catalysts with Co and N in various coordination states derived from the pyrolysis of ZIF-67.156,157 In particular, the contributions of different coordinated Co (Co–Nx) and N to trans/esterification were investigated in detail. According to density functional theory calculations, the adsorption energy of Co–Nx increased with the decrease in the coordination numbers of N; among them, the adsorption energy of cobalt nanoparticles was −1.345 eV, which indicated that more acetic acid could be adsorbed on cobalt nanoparticles, thus improving the activity of carbonium ions and promoting the esterification reaction. Also, the free energy of methanol adsorption and conversion to active methoxy anion on pyridine-N was +1.686 eV due to the strong electronegativity of pyridine, which was lower than that on pyrrole-N and graphite-N, demonstrating that pyridine-N was the best active site in catalytic transesterification. Besides, plentiful mesopores generated by pyrolysis played a positive role in the interaction between the substrate and the active sites. As a result, the yield of biodiesel prepared from microalgae lipid achieved was 96%, and the remaining 89.7% was achieved in the sixth cycle.156
3.7 UMOF catalysts
As reported, MOFs are a kind of crystalline porous coordination polymer with periodic network structure (Table 9).72,73 Some specific coordination polymers, such as trivalent and tetravalent metal phosphates, are normally short of the highly ordered structure defined by MOFs and featured by precipitation in the form of layered hybrids with poor crystallinity.158 However, their good thermal stability and easy functionalization make them potential catalysts in biodiesel production. Representatively, an acid–base bifunctional organic–inorganic hybrid mesoporous zirconium phosphate (ZP) was manufactured by Pan et al. via a template-free method under solvothermal conditions. After post modification with sulfonic acid-functionalized polyionic liquid (P[SIH]), the final bifunctional catalyst was successfully fabricated (ZP-P [SIH]), as shown in Fig. 20. ZP-P [SIH] presented a coral blocky appearance with an obvious cavity and rich uniform mesoporous structure, which improved mass transfer and reaction efficiency. More importantly, through control experiments, it was found that evenly dispersed multi-active sites endowed it with excellent activity after the introduction of ionic liquid, and its benign hydrophobicity also lessened the adsorption toxicity of byproduct water to the catalytic sites. For biodiesel production by oleic acid and crude Euphorbia lathyris L. oil, esterification with methanol gave 96% and 93% yield, respectively.159 Similarly, another phosphate-based porous zinc sulfonated zinc phosphate (HZnPS-1) was reported by Bhaumik et al.160 The high activity sulfonic acid group introduced by sulfonation and abundant mesopores that may come from the intervoids between the flake particles endowed it with excellent activity in the esterification of long-chain fatty acids. At room temperature, 90% yield and acceptable reusability were observed.

Utilizing zinc acetate and 4,40-bipyridine as raw materials, Zn coordination polymer [Zn(4,4-bipy)(OAc)2]n was successfully synthesized by Farzaneh et al. The N atoms in organic ligands rendered the catalyst advantageous basicity in biodiesel production. The effects of reaction temperature, reaction time, methanol/oil molar ratio, and catalyst dosage on the yield were also investigated. Using soybean oil as a feedstock, the molar ratio of methanol to oil is 12:1 and the yield of biodiesel was 98% in the reaction time of 2 h with 2% catalyst at 180 °C, and there was no obvious desorption after 5 cycles of operation.161 With no template, a novel porous acid–base bifunctional catalyst (FDCA-Hf) was prepared by Li et al. through by the simple assembly of hafnium with 2,5-furan dicarboxylic acid (FDCA), one of the top-12 valuable molecules in lignocellulose listed by the U.S. Department of Energy. Favorable mesopores with a size of 6.9 nm, middling surface area of 365.8 m2 g−1, and rich acid–base active sites with a density of 0.51/0.97 mmol g−1 enabled it to efficiently catalyze the Meerwein–Ponndorf–Verley reaction and the preparation of biodiesel from Jatropha curcas oil with a high acid value under mild conditions. Furthermore, through the poisoned experiments, it indicated that the Brønsted acid sites in FDCA-Hf were the dominant part to obtain the 98% biodiesel yield.162 In addition, Li et al. also reported a series of mesoporous zirconium phosphonates that were synthesized by a simple and template-free assembly, and the prepared m-PhPZr showed remarkable performance in the transfer hydrogenation of biomass-derived compounds.163
3.8 Biomass-derived catalysts
Despite the outstanding catalytic performance of those abovementioned chemical-based porous coordination polymers for biodiesel production, their relatively high cost and non-degradability limit their application. Hence, a series of biocompatible and renewable biomass-based catalysts have attracted abundant attention (Table 10).

3.8.1 Alginate coordination polymer. 
Alginic acid [(C6H8O6)n], composed of (1,4)-linked of β-D-mannuronic acid and L-guluronic acids, is a natural polysaccharide long-chain biopolymer.164 Due to the carboxyl group, it can chelate with Na+, Al3+, and other cationic metal ions to form various alginates. Among them, sodium alginate is the common extract obtained from seaweed and used for further modification.165 Based on sodium alginate modified with butanol166 and sodium alginate as the shell material,167 Furusawa's research group encapsulated CaO particles, CaO, and active carbon powders to prepare microcapsules. Compared with CaO particles, the CaO microcapsule system assisted in improving the accumulation rate of FAME and impeded the dissolution of catalysts, impressively shortening the reaction time from 12 h to 6 h. Upon being applied to the transesterification of rapeseed oil with methanol, 95% yield of fresh catalyst and acceptable loss of activity after three runs were observed. For CaO and active carbon microcapsule system, the novelty of the research was to investigate the transesterification of rapeseed oil and methanol under photocatalysis, in which, activated carbon worked as a medium to convert the light energy absorbed from the outside into heat energy, which made the temperature inside the microcapsule higher than that of the external reactants, suggesting the feasibility of light-driven preparation of biodiesel; 80% FAME conversation rate was reported after 6 h reaction time. However, it was inevitable that the mechanical capsule of the sodium alginate shell broke under the stirring force, which could be optimized by forming rigid organic–inorganic hybrid shells by introducing inorganic solids onto organic microcapsule shells. In this regard, Furusawa's research group further modified the sodium alginate capsule with a silane coupling agent to prepare FAME from rapeseed oil and methanol.168 As a result, a significant decrease in the capsule breakage rate from 18.8% to 2.6% was reported after being modified with n-butyltrimethoxysilane (BTMS). Nevertheless, the modified capsule shell inevitably hindered the permeation rate of the reactants, leading to a relatively lower FAME yield (63%). Another interesting catalyst, PVA (polyvinyl alcohol)-alginate-sulfate beads immobilizing lipase, was reported by Matinja et al., giving the methyl oleate conversion of 65.06%.169
In one of the examples, it was reported by Y. L. Cheryl-Low et al. that Al3+ as Lewis acid was introduced into alginate to prepare aluminum alginate (Fig. 21).170 Palm fatty acid distillate (PFAD), a byproduct formed from crude palm oil refinery process, was employed to synthesize biodiesel by transesterification with methanol. With the introduction of the aluminum phase, the Al–A catalyst presented a rough and wrinkled surface and decreased crystallinity, which resulted in a larger specific surface area. In addition, it also significantly increased the acidity of the catalyst, especially the intermediate acidic sites. Optimized by RSM, a high yield of 92% was achieved at the optimum reaction conditions, but the reusability (45%, eighth run) was unsatisfactory due to the inevitable leaching of Al3+. Similarly, Cu2+-alginate beads were developed by Zhang et al. to prepare biodiesel with oleic acid and methanol as the feedstock.171 After Cu2+ is chelated to sodium alginate by ion exchange with Na+, the obtained Cu-SA appeared as a tubular structure with entangled reticulation, indicating that there was a larger surface area and more active centers that could be exposed. The yield was found to be 71.8% with effective esterification of non-edible oils with high acid value. Two different support matrices for lipase immobilization, calcium alginate, and Irvingia gabonensis matrices, were compared by Kareem et al., and calcium alginate-immobilized lipase gave higher biodiesel production from palm oil together with better reusability, which could be attributed to the better biocompatibility with lipase.172
 Fig. 21  Cross-linking of sodium alginate with aluminum ions.170 
As illustrated in Fig. 22, a novel bifunctional catalyst was prepared by Fe3+ crosslinking, followed by organotriphosphonic acid-functionalization.173 Here, Fe3+ acted as Lewis acidic sites and phosphoric acid acted as Brønsted acidic sites, promoting esterification cooperatively (Fig. 23). In particular, protons from organic triphosphate activated the carboxyl groups, improving the affinity of carbon atoms for electrons, thus facilitating the nucleophilic attack of ethanol, and ethyl oleate was fabricated through tetrahedral rearrangement and dehydration. According to the RSM, the optimum reaction condition was determined as 9.53% of the catalyst amount, 8.62:1 of ethanol to oleic acid molar ratio, and the reaction temperature of 91 °C, achieving an ethyl oleate yield of 93.17%. In addition, Ganesan research group reported two examples using ferric alginate beads for biodiesel production.174,175 First, microspherical ferric alginate was used as a single catalyst for the preparation of methyl laurate, and as the Na+ exchange with Fe3+, the pH of FA beads was demonstrated to be in the range of 1.8–3.0, suggesting its strong acidity, and Fe3+ was subsequently confirmed to be the major active site of esterification. Under the reaction conditions optimized by RSM, a high yield of 99% was reported.174 Then, an interesting sequential esterification and transesterification method catalyzed by FA beads and boiler ash-calcium oxide mix (BA-CaO) was probed by Ganesan's research group to convert high FFA oil into biodiesel. In particular, this method was found to be very versatile due to its ability to be utilized to synthesize biodiesel from the low-quality oils of up to 20% FFA and omitted the traditional two-step product separation.175

3.8.2 Other biomass-derived catalysts. 
Chitosan, an alkaline polysaccharide, is the product of the deacetylation of chitin that normally consists of the shell and skeletons of crustaceans and plant cell walls.176 Benefiting from the weak alkalinity, biocompatibility, non-toxicity, and easy availability, it has been widely used in medicine, environmental remediation, textiles, etc.177 For biodiesel production, a series of interesting and efficient chitosan and chitosan-derived catalysts were reported, including chitosan-cryogel beads,178 CaO/chitosan,179 adsorbed Cu(II) and Co(II) ionic chitosan.180 As shown in Fig. 24, the amino groups in chitosan were bonded with Ti4+ through coordination bonds. Later, Ti/chitosan was mixed with HPW solution, and HPW molecules were anchored by electrostatic interaction to prepare the final HPW/Ti/chitosan hybrids.181 The basicity slightly decreased from 0.69 mmol g−1 to 0.29 mmol g−1, which might be attributed to the coordination of partial amino and hydroxyl groups with Ti4+, while the Lewis acidic strength was advanced to 0.56 mmol g−1; more importantly, the introduction of Ti4+ transformed nonporous natural chitosan into porous hybrid material with a large specific area of 133.18 m2 g−1. Also, a series of HPW/Ti/chitosan hybrids with adjustable total acidity was prepared by supporting HPW with different mass ratios. Although the acidity was proportional to the mass ratio of HPW, excess HPW enrichment would lessen the catalytic activity. The performance of the catalyst was evaluated by the esterification of palmitic acid with methanol, and the conversion reached 97.3% under the optimum conditions due to tri-functional sites, which were Lewis acid Ti4+, Brønsted acid derived from HPW, and alkaline –NH2 site in chitosan. Besides, HPW/Ti/chitosan hybrids were reused for six runs with a slight leaching of Ti4+ (6.2%) and HPW (5.8%).

In another precedent, Mg or Zn was coordinated with cyclodextrin in two different types (Fig. 25). The results indicated that neither Mg, Zn ions nor cyclodextrin alone could effectively synthesize biodiesel from non-edible oil X. sibiricum Patr oil, while via the synergistic action of metal ions and cyclodextrin, the yield of FAME was improved substantially.182 Briefly, the development of coordination polymers of biomass derivatives has broad application prospects and conforms to the concept of green chemistry. In addition to the aforementioned biomass derivative, there are other biomass polymers with coordination groups such as amino or carboxyl groups that need to be investigated.

4. Effects of the reaction conditions on biodiesel production
For the preparation of biodiesel, the optimization of reaction conditions including the amount of the catalyst, the type and molar ratio of alcohol, reaction temperature and time, water and FFA content of the substrate, and relevant auxiliaries of ultrasound and microwave, are of great significance to the final yield. Considering this, this section mainly investigates the influences of the above reaction conditions on the final yield and the optimal parameters. In the end, some auxiliary for biodiesel production technologies (ultrasound and microwave) were also introduced.
4.1. Alcohol type and molar ratio
Various alcohols with different carbon numbers have been adopted to synthesize biodiesel, for example, methanol, ethanol, propanol, isopropanol, and butanol.28,183 According to the mechanism of transesterification/esterification in section 2, the nucleophilicity and steric hindrance of different alcohols had an important influence on the reaction.184,185 The nucleophilic and spatial effects of different alkoxy anions are as follows.
Nucleophilicity: CH3O− > C2H5O− > C3H7O− > C4H9O−
Spatial effect: CH3O− < C2H5O− < C3H7O− < C4H9O−
Based on the above two factors, it could be concluded that with the growth of the carbon chain, the transesterification rate and equilibrium constant gradually decreased, which was consistent with the research of H. Sanli et al.186 H. Sanli reported a detailed comparison of biodiesel prepared from methanol, ethanol, 2-propanol, and 1-butanol as substrates. By comparing ester conversion and fuel characteristics, methanol was the most suitable alcohol for biodiesel production. Furthermore, the research group of Hanh et al. attributed the poor catalytic performance of secondary alcohol (2-propanol, 2-butanol, 2-hexanol, and 2-octanol) to its large steric hindrance.183 Considering the low price and abundant resources, methanol is generally the preferred reactant for the production of biodiesel.
In the light of Fig. 3, 3 mol methanol was required to synthesize 1 mol FAME. Owing to the reversibility of the transesterification reaction, excess methanol is conducive to the positive direction of the reaction. However, exaggerating the amount of methanol might dilute the catalyst concentration, leading to worse catalytic performance and lower conversion.187,188 It was further confirmed in Pangestu's optimization process that as the methanol:oil volume ratio increases from 5:1 to 10:1, the yield of FAME decreases slightly.78 In the presence of an enzyme catalyst, high alcohol concentration may even inactivate the enzyme.189 For instance, in a solvent-free medium catalyzed by immobilized Thermomyces lanuginosus lipase, the maximum initial reaction rate was 9.0 g l−1 min−1 for a 1:1 molar ratio of methanol to oil. When the molar equivalent of methanol exceeds 1.5, the inactivation of the enzyme was observed.190 In summary, the most suitable molar ratio was related to the type of the catalyst and was one of the most crucial parameters for optimizing the experiment.
4.2. Reaction temperature and time
According to the chemical reaction kinetics, the reaction speed can be accelerated by increasing the reaction temperature.191 Moreover, the trans/esterification reaction belongs to the endothermic reaction, which means that external heat is essential to promote the reaction. Generally speaking, the optimal temperature is controlled around the boiling point of substrate alcohol (methanol boiling point 64.7 °C), maintaining a slightly boiling state, which was in line with Zhang research group's optimization result (65 °C) of methanol as the reactant.192 The exorbitant temperature will lead to methanol evaporation, hindering the progress of transesterification and consuming abundant heat energy. For an enzyme-catalyzed system, the reaction conditions were normally milder, avoiding the inactivation of the enzymes due to high temperature. Accordingly, the reaction rate catalyzed by immobilized Thermomyces lanuginosus lipase (molar ratio of 1:1) increased significantly when the temperature increased from 30 °C to 40 °C, but no noticeable improvement was observed when the temperature further increased to 50 °C.190
In optimizing the reaction conditions, the reaction time is usually determined by the amount of catalyst and reaction temperature molar ratio. Appropriately prolonging the reaction time can improve the conversion rate. Continuing to prolong the reaction time will reduce the utilization rate of the equipment, increase the production cost, and promote side reactions as well.193,194 The optimum reaction time normally refers to the time when the reaction reaches equilibrium. In this respect, a novel method of non-catalytic supercritical methyl acetate method was reported by Saka et al. and the influence of the reaction time was further investigated.195 The results showed that the yield of FAME was the highest at 45 minutes, and the decrease in the yield when extended to 60 minutes may be attributed to the thermal decomposition of FAME compounds. The reaction time is also related to the quality of raw oil. Low-quality oils such as waste cooking oil generally require a longer reaction time.
4.3. Catalyst amount
The catalyst amount is another crucial parameter for optimizing the esterification and transesterification. Initially, the increase in the catalyst concentration leads to the formation of more reaction activation centers and the yield is enhanced until the equilibrium point is achieved. Further adding the catalyst may block the pore size and increase the mass transfer resistance, resulting in the decline of FAME conversion.196,197 Especially in an alkaline catalytic system, excess catalyst might promote the saponification reaction. Xie et al. compared the oil conversion with different ZiF-8-Gua loadings (0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, and 1.2 wt%). The oil conversion was boosted from 51.4% to 95.4% by increasing the catalyst loading from 0.4 to 1.0 wt%. Yet, the conversion was slightly decreased as catalyst loading was enhanced to 1.2 wt%.112 Similarly, Bedir et al. determined that 5% was the optimal amount of the catalyst from 1% to 7%.198
4.4. Free water and FFA content
The feed oil applied for producing biodiesel is theoretically expected to be anhydrous to avoid triglyceride hydrolysis and saponification. Particularly in an alkaline catalytic environment, fatty acid salts formed by saponification will adhere to the surface of the catalyst.199,200 Moreover, severe saponification leads to the emulsification of the whole reaction system, resulting in the inability of trans/esterification.201 In the presence of Amberlyst-15 or sulfuric acid as a catalyst, the effect of water on the esterification of high FFA oil was investigated by Park et al.202 The results showed that even if the initial water content was 1% (relative to oil), the esterification reaction was hindered and the reverse reaction was promoted. Also, water had a greater impact on Amberlyst-15 catalysis due to the toxicity of water to the acidic sites. As the initial water content further increased to 20%, the esterification rate decreased significantly. Nevertheless, a certain amount of water is essential for enzyme catalysis to improve the activity of lipase. Sara Rafiei et al. researched the influence of water concentration in the range of 5–20 wt% and determined that 10% is the optimal water content.146
FFA content is another parameter that requires exacting control for biodiesel production catalyzed by alkaline, thus avoiding the consumption of extra catalyst.187 The acidic catalyst H6PV3MoW8O40/Fe3O4/ZIF-8 was developed by Xie's research group and applied to catalyze the trans/esterification of soybean oil simultaneously. Correspondingly, Xie reported the reduced conversion with the increase in FFA content from 2% to 14%.96 For high FFA rubber seed oil, A. S. Ramadhas et al. developed a two-step transesterification process: acid-catalyzed esterification reduces FFA content to less than 2%, followed by base-catalyzed transesterification, indicating an effective production route.203 The enzyme is relatively insensitive to the substrate containing abundant FFA. In this regard, Kírian et al. reported biodiesel production from natural waste olive oil with high FFA content catalyzed by recombinant 1,3-positional selective Rhizopus oryzae lipase. Not only was the initial reaction rate improved but the enzyme was also claimed to obtain better stability due to the high FFA content.204
4.5. Ultrasound and microwave
Ultrasound refers to the mechanical waves with short wavelengths and high frequency (≥20 kHz).205 For an immiscible reaction system, cavitation will occur in the presence of ultrasound, resulting in abundant bubbles, expanding and exploding, to strengthen the contact between the reactants and promote trans/esterification.206,207 Many pieces of research on the ultrasonic-assisted synthesis of biodiesel have been reported. Amit Pal et al. took advantage of ultrasonic cavitation to synthesize biodiesel from WCO, which obtained a higher conversion rate in a shorter time compared with the mechanical stirring method.206 Similarly, Rathod et al. confirmed that the biodiesel synthesized by ultrasonic-assisted synthesis had a superior performance in comparison with the traditional stirring method, boosting the yield from 65.6% to 93.5%.208 In addition, the consistent result was also reported by Devarajan's research group.209
In contrast, microwave, an electromagnetic wave with a frequency of 300 MHz–300 GHz, generates heat through the interaction between polar molecules and microwave electromagnetic fields to realize uniform and rapid heating.210,211 With the assistance of microwave radiation, Lin reported a faster and more efficient preparation of biodiesel from Jatropha curcas seed oil, achieving 90% conversion in merely 10 s.212 Moreover, Yu et al. reported that microwave radiation also had positive effects on the enhancement of the enzyme activity in the ionic liquid medium, which might be attributed to the direct effect of microwaves on ionic liquids. Under the synergistic activation of microwave and ionic liquid, a remarkable yield of 92% together with excellent recyclability was obtained.213 Employing microwave crushing technology, Dai et al. investigated the preparation of biodiesel by microwave-assisted extraction of lipids in different solvents, and the best conversion obtained was 76.2%.214 In particular, Pravin et al. adopted conjoint ultrasound and microwave reactors to synthesize biodiesel. While significantly reducing the specific energy consumption, it suggested another potential associated and efficient method.215
Overall, the substrate and catalytic environment had great impacts on the parameters that needed to be optimized. For oil with high FFA and water content, efficient FAME conversion could be realized using acidic or enzymatic catalysts, while FAME synthesis can be completed in a short time under alkaline conditions. In addition, biodiesel production catalyzed by lipase can be carried out under milder conditions, but it usually takes a longer time, which can be shortened by ultrasound or microwave.
5. Conclusion and perspectives
As a significant kind of green and renewable biofuel, biodiesel has attracted the extensive attention of researchers. For industrial production, homogeneous alkali is widely used, benefited by its short reaction time and fast reaction speed. Nonetheless, the defects of complex post-treatment and pollution of homogeneous catalysts are forcing the transition toward heterogeneous ones that are convenient to reuse. Among them, OIHPCPs with high specific surface area and functionalized highly active sites have been widely investigated in the synthesis of biodiesel. Therefore, this review systematically emphasized the application of OIHPCPs in biodiesel production, including pristine MOF catalysts, functionalized (i.e., acid, base, bifunctional, and enzymatic) MOF catalysts, MOF derivate catalysts, UMOF catalysts, and biomass derivate coordination polymer catalysts. In addition, the mechanisms of esterification and transesterification reactions, factors affecting the yield of biodiesel, and auxiliary technologies (ultrasound and microwave) were also clearly introduced (Fig. 26). The main findings and future perspectives are summarized as follows.
 Fig. 26  The main finding of functionalized organic–inorganic hybrid porous coordination polymers catalysts for biodiesel production. 
I. MOFs, as typical kinds of organic–inorganic hybrid coordination polymers, can be effectively applied in the preparation of biodiesel. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that MOFs are also considered good functional matrixes, which will bring about better catalytic performance by immobilizing efficient active sites.
II. Among them, as concluded from this study, acid-functionalized MOFs by sulfonation, ILs, or HPA loading are the most widely investigated due to their wider applicability. However, higher temperature and higher alcohol-oil ratio make them unsuitable for the industrial production of biodiesel, which should be further investigated, optimized, and improved.
III. The effective immobilization of active sites is a great challenge for base functionalization. Although the alkaline environment can realize transesterification in a shorter time, the strict requirements for the acid value and water content of substrate oil limit its wide application. On the contrary, acid–base bifunctional catalysts are considered desirable catalysts for the industrial synthesis of biodiesel, in terms of their ability to catalyze trans/esterification with beneficial synergy and integrate catalytic conversion and product/catalyst recovery in a simple one-pot process.
IV. Biodiesel production catalyzed by ecofriendly enzymes can be carried out under mild conditions. To strengthen the stability, it is of great significance to understand the interaction mechanism between the MOF and enzymes at the molecular level, which is rarely reported in enzyme-based MOFs reference. On the other hand, looking for economic enzymes with high activity and fabricating novel MOFs with suitable pore sizes are long-term challenges for researchers, wherein MOF derivatives are prepared by calcination or carbonization, which seem to be an easy and effective pore size optimization method; in particular, the generated coordination defect is also motivating to the synthesis of biodiesel.
V. Importantly, developing UMOFs with diverse molecular structures is strongly recommended. Exploring more metal attachment centers and different organic ligands, especially biomass-derived species, such as FDCA-HF, should be deemed as a feasible and highly promising direction. From a practical standpoint, utilizing biodegradable biomass-derived coordination polymers with a wide range of sources to achieve a more efficient and mild catalytic process and to realize the green biodiesel synthesis indeed shows the prospect of industrialized applications.
VI. For various catalytic environments and substrate oils, reaction temperature, alcohol-oil molar ratio, and catalyst dosage are the principle optimization parameters affecting the final biodiesel yield. An appealing pattern of ultrasound and microwave can obviously promote trans/esterification. In addition, it was also found to play a positive role in improving the stability of the enzyme activity, for which this should be further developed in the future.
VII. Last but not least, hydrophobicity and magnetism also demonstrate a great influence on the activity and recoverability of the catalyst, which is also ought to be taken into account in the design philosophy fabrication of the catalyst. To successfully realize the application of heterogeneous catalysts in industrial production, powdered catalysts, which are the vast majority of synthetic catalysts, need to be further optimized in the future to adapt to the utilization and recovery of continuous fixed reactions.
