, Accepted 8th June 2021First published on 15th June 2021AbstractLead-free ceramics play a vital role in the context of sustainable development for energy storage applications due to their high power density, excellent high temperature resistance and nontoxicity. Nevertheless, the low energy density and small energy conversion efficiency of lead-free ceramics caused by the contradictory relation of polarization and electric breakdown strength restrict the urgent need for electronic components towards miniaturization and achieving light weight. Herein, to overcome this challenge and optimize the energy storage properties of lead-free ceramics, unlike the traditional approaches of oxide doping, adopting new sintering techniques and optimizing the composition, samples with a spatial sandwich structure were constructed and prepared by the tape casting technique. Obviously, the opposite relationship between the polarization and the electric breakdown strength can be resolved very well via this design strategy. The recoverable energy storage density reaches 6.3 J cm−3 together with high energy conversion efficiency (93.61%) and high applied electric field (540 kV cm−1). An ultrahigh power density of 215 MW cm−3 and a fast discharge time of 140 ns can also be realized. In addition, the energy conversion efficiency is higher than 90% and the variation of recoverable energy storage density is less than ±2% within 1–100 Hz and 1–105 fatigue cycles. Meanwhile, the change of recoverable energy storage density is also less than ±6.5% from 30 °C to 160 °C. The above results indicate that the current study helps to promote the development of eco-friendly ceramics for high energy storage applications.
1. Introduction
Faced with the problems of the energy crisis and climate change, numerous new sustainable and renewable energy sources (such as solar, wind, water, etc.) have been a hot spot of the current research and received considerable attention.1–3 On this point, energy storage systems also play particularly important roles. At present, the devices that are mainly used for electrical energy storage and conversion are dielectric capacitors, electrochemical capacitors, batteries, fuel cells, electrolyzers, etc.4–7 In comparison, dielectric capacitors possess large power density, high voltage endurance and fast charging–discharging speed, which can be used for pulsed power weapons, advanced propulsion devices and other energy storage systems.1,8,9 However, the low energy storage density of dielectric capacitors restricts their potential applications. The energy storage capability including the total energy storage density (Wtot), the recoverable energy storage density (Wrec), the energy loss density (Wloss) and the energy conversion efficiency (η) of dielectric capacitors can be calculated based on measured polarization versus electric field (P–E) loops.10 The corresponding schematic and calculation formulae are displayed in Fig. 1(a). Obviously, large maximum polarization (Pmax), small remnant polarization (Pr) and high maximum applied electric field (Emax) are crucial to achieve superior energy storage properties and enable the development of high energy storage applications.

At the present time, polymers, thin films and bulk ceramics are three main types of dielectric capacitor material. Ordinarily, polymer-based dielectrics and thin film dielectrics possess high Wrec (>15 J cm−3) due to their large Emax (>1000 kV cm−1) and low thickness (for instance, a Wrec of 18.6 J cm−3 and an efficiency of ∼85% can be achieved in (BiFeO3)0.4–(SrTiO3)0.6 thin films with a thickness of ∼400 nm).11–13 Polymer-based dielectrics exhibit low weight and high applied electric field but a small dielectric constant and poor thermal stability (<100 °C), and their η always tends to decay significantly at high applied electric field.14,15 Meanwhile, the total energy that can be stored for polymers and thin film dielectric capacitors is less than that of bulk ceramic dielectrics caused by their small total volume.16 These results limit the applications of polymers and thin film dielectric capacitors in energy storage fields. Thus, bulk ceramic dielectrics are becoming a promising alternative. The energy storage density of bulk ceramics can be further enhanced via fabricating multilayer ceramic capacitors (MLCCs). For instance, J. Li et al.17 realized a Wrec of 2.5 J cm−3 in (Na0.5Bi0.5)TiO3–0.45(Sr0.7Bi0.2)TiO3 ceramics and 9.5 J cm−3 in (Na0.5Bi0.5)TiO3–0.45(Sr0.7Bi0.2)TiO3 MLCCs using the internal electrodes of Pt. Moreover, G. Wang et al.18 obtained a maximum Wrec of 2.45 J cm−3 accompanied by η of 72% in doped BiFeO3–BaTiO3 ceramics while the Wrec can be enhanced to 10.5 J cm−3 after preparing the MLCCs. Dielectric ceramics can be categorized into four main types: antiferroelectric (AFE) ceramics, ferroelectric (FE) ceramics, relaxor ferroelectric (RFE) ceramics and linear dielectric (LD) ceramics.17,19–26 Among these systems, the AFE and RFE ceramics are helpful in enhancing the energy storage properties due to their large Pmax, small Pr and moderate Emax. However, most AFE ceramics contain the element Pb, which is bad for environmental protection and human health. Therefore, the lead-free ceramics of RFE become promising candidates for high energy storage applications. Among the present reported lead-free ceramics of RFE, it can be found that Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3 (BNT) stands out because of its large Pmax (∼40 μC cm−2) and the similar lone pair electronic configuration of Bi3+ and Pb2+, due to which it is widely perceived as a promising candidate for advanced energy storage applications.16,27–29 It was unfortunate that the pure BNT ceramics possess large Pr, and high coercive field and conductivity, which limits the improvement of energy storage properties. In order to overcome these problems and optimize the energy storage capability of BNT-based ceramics, numerous methods have been employed, such as oxide doping,30–33 adopting new sintering techniques34–36 and optimizing the composition.17,29,37 In addition, Q. Li et al.38 indicated that the energy density and Pmax can be modified by modulating the ratio of Bi and Na for 0.94Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3–0.06BaTiO3 ceramics. J. Zhang et al.39 introduced the multi-ions of La3+, K+, Al3+, Nb5+ and Zr4+ into BNT ceramics to reduce the Pr and enhance the Emax, resulting in an excellent energy storage capability (Wrec = 3.24 J cm−3, η = 82%) at 200 kV cm−1. A relatively high Wrec of 3.6 J cm−3 and η of 80% together with excellent thermal stability and frequency stability were realized in 0.75Na0.5Bi0.5TiO3–0.25SrTiO3 ceramics modified with Ag(Nb0.85Ta0.15)O3.40 Although extensive research studies have been carried out to optimize the energy storage capability of BNT-based lead-free ceramics, up to now, it is difficult to achieve high Wrec (>4 J cm−3), η (>80%) and Emax (>400 kV cm−1) synchronously for most of them.
To improve the energy storage properties of BNT-based ceramics significantly, ceramic dielectrics with a sandwich structured design have been constructed and reported in our previous work.41 This earlier work focused on investigating the energy storage properties of sandwich structured ceramics with different thicknesses of the middle layers and outer layers. It was found that the sandwich structured design is an effective way to solve the conflict between high breakdown strength and high polarization of the ceramic dielectrics, resulting in high energy storage properties. Unfortunately, dielectrics with high polarization were always adopted as the outer layers for sandwich structured ceramics in the previous study. The effects of outer layers with high polarization and high applied electric field for energy storage properties have not been analyzed in detail, which will probably limit the advantages of sandwich structured ceramics and the improvement of energy storage properties. Therefore, sandwich structured ceramics with different spatial structure configurations were designed and prepared in this work. Herein, based on the previous reports,29,38 the representative 0.94Bi0.55Na0.45TiO3–0.06BaTiO3 (BNBT) and 0.80Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3–0.20SrNb0.5Al0.5O3 (BNTSNA) were selected as high polarization layers (providing high Pmax) and high electrical insulation layers (providing high Emax), respectively. The corresponding schematic diagram of this design strategy is presented in Fig. 1(b), where the sandwich structured ceramics with the high polarization layers of BNBT located at the outer layers of BNTSNA and the reverse sandwich structured ceramics with the high polarization layers of BNBT in the middle of two insulation layers of BNTSNA were investigated in detail. Consequently, large Pmax, small Pr and high Emax can be realized simultaneously via this spatial sandwich structure design, leading to excellent energy storage properties and superior stability. A considerable Wrec of 6.3 J cm−3 and ultra-high energy conversion efficiency of 93.61% can be obtained at a high applied electric field of 540 kV cm−1 in this study. Moreover, the variation of Wrec is less than ±6.5% over a broad frequency range, temperature range and cycle numbers, exhibiting superior stability of the energy storage properties.
2. Materials and methods
2.1 Sample preparation
Based on the chemical formulae of 0.94Bi0.55Na0.45TiO3–0.06BaTiO3 (BNBT) and 0.80Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3–0.20SrNb0.5Al0.5O3 (BNTSNA), the raw chemicals of Bi2O3, TiO2, Nb2O5, Al2O3, Na2CO3, BaCO3 and SrCO3 were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. Their purity is ≥99.9%, ≥98%, ≥99.5%, ≥99.99%, ≥99.8%, ≥99% and ≥99.0%, respectively. Above all, the BNBT and BNTSNA powders were synthesized by a conventional solid-state reaction method. Firstly, according to the chemical formulae of BNBT and BNTSNA, the corresponding starting materials of carbonates and oxides were weighed and ball-milled in the medium of absolute ethanol and zirconia balls for 12 h. After ball-milling, the mixed powders were dried at 100 °C for 8 h and calcined at 850 °C for 4 h. The BNBT and BNTSNA powders can be obtained after ball-milling the calcined powders in the medium of absolute ethanol and zirconia balls for 12 h again. The absolute ethanol, glycerol trioleate, butanone, dibutyl phthalate, polyethylene glycol, polyvinyl butyral and the media of zirconia balls as well as the BNBT and BNTSNA powders were employed to obtain a homogeneous tape casting slurry.29,42 The homogeneous tape casting slurry, as shown in Fig. S1(a),† was cast on a PET (polyethylene terephthalate) release film and dried at room temperature. The effective width of the scraper for tape casting is 18 cm. The width and the thickness of the PET release film are 20 cm and 100 μm, respectively. In this process, the height between the scraper and the PET release film is 120 μm and the casting speed was 0.6 cm s−1. After drying, as shown in Fig. S1(b),† the effective width and thickness of the tape casting thick films were about 18 cm and 18 ± 1 μm, respectively. And then, the tape casting thick films were cut into squares with a length of approximately 10.5 ± 0.5 mm as well as stacked and laminated with the designed structure by BNBT and BNTSNA layers. The sandwich structured ceramics and the reverse sandwich structured ceramics were stacked with two layers of BNTSNA and two layers of BNBT, as shown in Fig. 2(a). The sandwich structured ceramics were composed of a middle layer (two layers of BNTSNA) and two outer layers (one layer of BNBT on each side of the middle layer). The reverse sandwich structured ceramics were also composed of a middle layer (two layers of BNBT) and two outer layers (one layer of BNTSNA on each side of the middle layer). For the convenience of discussion, the sandwich structured ceramics and the reverse sandwich structured ceramics were defined as S1 and S2, respectively, in this study. For removing the organic materials that were added into the tape casting slurry, the green bodies were sintered at 600 °C for 8 h. After burning out the organic materials, the samples were further sintered by a two-step sintering method. At first, the temperature of the furnace was raised from room temperature to 1200 °C with a heating rate of 3 °C min−1 and then decreased to 1060 °C immediately with a cooling rate of 20 °C min−1 and maintained at 1060 °C for 4 h. The images of the prepared ceramic samples are presented in Fig. S1(c).†

2.2 Characterization
A field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, FEI Nova NanoSEM 450) was employed to observe the microstructure and an energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) was also used. The phase structure was determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD, D/MAX 2550V, Rigaku, Japan). For measuring and evaluating the electric properties, gold electrodes with a diameter of 2 mm were sputtered on the surfaces of the samples and heated at 300 °C for 30 min with a heating rate of 5 °C min−1. The dielectric constant and dielectric loss as a function of frequency (100 Hz to 1 MHz) and temperature (from −100 °C to 450 °C) were determined using a precision LCR meter (E4980A, Agilent). The P–E loops were measured using a ferroelectric analyzer (Precision Premier II, Radiant, USA). Moreover, finite element analysis was used to evaluate the electric breakdown process. Finally, the charging–discharging properties were investigated using a well-designed resistance–inductance–capacitance (RLC) load circuit. As shown in Fig. S2,† the charge can be stored in the samples when turning the bidirectional switch to the left. And then the switch is turned right automatically and the stored charge in the sample is released.28,43
3. Results and discussion
The thermally etched surface images of the BNTSNA and BNBT ceramics are presented in Fig. S3(a) and (b).† The statistics on the grain size distributions are shown in Fig. S3(c) and (d).† Obviously, the ceramic samples were sintered densely accompanied by small grain size. The average grain size of the BNTSNA and BNBT ceramics is 0.51 μm and 0.59 μm, respectively. Some secondary phase appeared in the SEM micrographs of BNBT ceramics, which may be caused by the Bi-excess and Na-deficiency in this system and can also be detected in the XRD patterns of Fig. S4.† The cross-sectional SEM images of S1 and S2 are displayed in Fig. 2(b) and (c), respectively. The top right corner of Fig. 2(b) and (c) is the corresponding local enlarged image. Notably, the ceramics of S1 and S2 exhibit dense microstructure characterization and the BNBT and BNTSNA layers are combined very well. Meanwhile, as designed above, the S1 and S2 show a sandwich structure, which can be confirmed by the line scanning of Sr and Bi elements for representative reverse sandwich structured ceramics of S2 in Fig. 2(d). The variation of the intensity for Sr and Bi elements is a gradual process rather than an abrupt change between the BNBT layer and the BNTSNA layer. It is due to the fact that the major component of the BNBT and BNTSNA layers is BNT, because of which inter-diffusion may occur within different layers.
The dielectric constant and dielectric loss (loss-tangent) dependent frequency (100 Hz to 1 MHz) for BNBT and BNTSNA ceramics as well as sandwich structured ceramics of S1 and reverse sandwich structured ceramics of S2 are presented in Fig. 3(a). One can see that the dielectric constant tends to decline while the dielectric loss tends to increase gradually with the increased frequency for all the ceramics, which may be caused by the dielectric relaxor behavior and a similar phenomenon can be observed in previous reports.44,45 At the same time, the dielectric constant of BNBT (ε′ = 1847 at 100 Hz) is higher than that of BNTSNA (ε′ = 1381 at 100 Hz). For the sandwich structured ceramics and the reverse sandwich ceramics of S1 and S2, the dielectric constant is close to that of BNBT ceramics and the dielectric loss is less than 0.05 at 100 Hz. The large dielectric constant and small dielectric loss make for realizing large Pmax and low energy loss. Furthermore, the dielectric constant and dielectric loss as a function of temperature (from −100 °C to 450 °C) for a representative S2 were measured (Fig. 3(b)). From the data in Fig. 3(b), it is apparent that the dielectric constant and dielectric loss exhibited obvious frequency dispersion within the temperature range of −100 °C to ∼120 °C, namely, the samples possess typical dielectric relaxor behaviors over a broad temperature range. Meanwhile, the dielectric constant is higher than 1000 from 0 °C to 450 °C at a broad frequency range (100 Hz to 1 MHz). The above excellent dielectric properties of S2, including the typical relaxor characteristics and large dielectric constant over a broad frequency range and temperature range, are conducive to broadening the operating temperature and operating frequency and improving the stability of the energy storage capability for practical applications.

 Fig. 3(c) shows the bipolar P–E loops for BNBT and BNTSNA ceramics as well as S1 and S2 under the same applied electric field of 200 kV cm−1 at 10 Hz and room temperature. The corresponding current versus electric field (I–E) curves are displayed in Fig. 3(d). As expected, the highest polarization with a Pmax of 35.41 μC cm−2 and a Pr of 4.08 μC cm−2 was exhibited for BNBT ceramics along with four large current peaks in the I–E curves while a small polarization with a Pmax of 22.73 μC cm−2 and a Pr of 0.39 μC cm−2 was recorded for BNTSNA ceramics accompanied by rectangular I–E curves. According to the spatial sandwich structure design (sandwich structured ceramics and reverse sandwich structured ceramics), the large Pmax (∼30 μC cm−2) and small Pr (∼1 μC cm−2) can be achieved simultaneously for S1 and S2. Meanwhile, the current peaks of I–E curves for S1 and S2 are near zero electric field and their intensity is less than that of BNBT ceramics. The above results indicated that S1 and S2 achieved large Pmax and small Pr, and may possess high Emax, leading to excellent energy storage properties. Hence, the energy storage capability of S1 and S2 was further investigated. Fig. 3(e) and (f) show the unipolar P–E loops for S1 and S2 under different electric fields. The values of Pmax, Pr and Pmax − Pr as a function of applied electric fields are presented in Fig. S5(a) and (b).† Meanwhile, the corresponding I–E curves under different applied electric fields are displayed in Fig. S6(a) and (b).† One can see that the P–E loops always maintain pinched and slim shapes with enhancing the applied electric field successively. At the same time, the values of Pmax increase rapidly while the values of Pr rise slightly with enhancing the applied electric field successively. This results in a continuously increased difference between Pmax and Pr, namely Pmax − Pr, with the enhanced applied electric field, which helps to realize high energy storage properties. Moreover, as shown in Fig. S6,† two obvious current peaks (particularly in the high applied electric field) near zero electric field can be observed, which can be attributed to the rapid response of polar nano-regions upon loading and unloading the external electric field. This phenomenon is beneficial to maintain high energy conversion efficiency. In addition, it is worth noting that the Emax of S2 (540 kV cm−1) is higher than that of S1 (374 kV cm−1). For dielectric materials, higher energy density can be achieved at higher applied electric field. In order to better analyze the electric breakdown characteristic for S1 and S2, finite element simulations were employed. Fig. 3(g) and (h) show the real-time evolution of electric potential distribution for S1 and S2 at an applied electric field of 500 kV cm−1. Correspondingly, the real-time growth process of breakdown paths and electric field distribution are given in Fig. 3(i) and (j). Herein, the electric breakdown paths were grown from the bottom electrode to the top electrode. Obviously, the internal electric field of S1 and S2 can be redistributed via the spatial sandwich structure design caused by different dielectric constants for the BNBT layer and BNTSNA layer. For sandwich structured ceramics of S1 with the large Pmax of BNBT in the outer layers and the high Emax of BNTSNA in the middle layer, the distortion of the equipotential lines is striking with the growth of electrical trees in the beginning. In contrast, the development of electrical trees in the reverse sandwich structured ceramics of S2 is slow and mild. That is to say, the electric potential drop of reverse sandwich structured ceramics of S2 is faster than that of sandwich structured ceramics of S1 with increasing time duration. Therefore, the Emax for reverse sandwich structured ceramics of S2 is superior to that of sandwich structured ceramics of S1, which may be caused by the strong charge injection from electrodes for S1 with a high dielectric constant of BNBT in the outer layer. A similar phenomenon has also been found in previous reports.46,47 Owing to the features of large Pmax, small Pr and high Emax, excellent energy storage properties may be realized in this contribution. Based on the P–E loops of Fig. 3(e) and (f), the calculated energy storage properties including Wtot, Wrec, Wloss and η for S1 and S2 as a function of applied electric field are presented in Fig. 4(a) and (b). Exhilaratingly, the values of Wtot and Wrec are close enough and increase monotonically for S1 and S2 with increasing applied electric field, leading to a high energy conversion efficiency and small energy loss density over a broad electric field range. More specifically, with increasing applied electric field from 40 kV cm−1 to 374 kV cm−1 for S1, Wtot and Wrec improved rapidly from 0.18 J cm−3 and 0.16 J cm−3 to 4.92 J cm−3 and 4.46 J cm−3, respectively, while Wloss was always less than 0.5 J cm−3 and η was still higher than 88%. Concurrently, the Emax reaches 540 kV cm−1 for S2. At this electric field, excellent energy storage properties with Wtot of 6.73 J cm−3, Wrec of 6.3 J cm−3 and η of 93.6% can be realized simultaneously. The high Wrec of 6.3 J cm−3 (∼0.3 W h kg−1) together with high η enabled the development of high energy storage devices with high reliability. Fig. 4(c) summarizes the Wrec and η for S2 in this study and other lead-free ceramics in recent reports.17–20,23,24,37,48–50 Clearly, there are few reports that achieved high Wrec (>4 J cm−3) and η (>80%) simultaneously for lead-free ceramics. In comparison, excellent comprehensive properties with Wrec of 6.3 J cm−3 and η of 93.6% have been realized for S2 at a high applied electric field of 540 kV cm−1 in this work.

For dielectric capacitors that are used for pulsed power systems, the indicators of discharge speed and power density are also very important. To evaluate the discharge speed and power density in this study, a representative S2 was selected and the charging–discharging characteristics were measured. Fig. S7(a)† shows the overdamped discharge current curves for S2 under different electric fields. As seen, the discharge current reaches the peak quickly with increasing time and the values of the peak increase gradually with enhancing the electric field. According to the overdamped discharge current curves, the discharge energy density (Wd) can be calculated with the following equation and the related discharge time (t0.9, defined as the time when the value of Wd reaches 90%) can also be evaluated.  where R is the external load resistor (it is 292.5 Ω in this work). V and i denote the volume of the dielectrics and the discharge current, respectively. Based on this equation, the calculated Wdversus time curves for S2 are presented in Fig. 4(d). We can see that the Wd increases rapidly from 0.02 to 2.52 J cm−3 with the increment of electric field from 20 to 380 kV cm−1 (Fig. 4(d) and S7(b)†). The discharge time, t0.9, tends to decrease with the increment of electric field and reaches 140 ns at 380 kV cm−1 (Fig. S7(b)†). The extremely short discharge time (ultrafast discharge speed) is eminently suitable for advanced pulsed power systems. In addition, the underdamped discharge current versus time under different electric fields for S2 was measured to evaluate the power density, as displayed in Fig. 4(e). Correspondingly, the maximum discharge current (Imax), current density (CD, CD = Imax/S) and power density (PD, PD = EImax/(2S), where S represents the electrode area of the samples) as a function of electric field are presented in the inset of Fig. 4(e). One can see that the underdamped discharge current curves exhibit an obvious sine waveform and the current achieved the maximum value in the first current peak and then decayed rapidly with increasing time, which further indicates that S2 possesses ultrafast discharge speed. Meanwhile, as shown in the inset of Fig. 4(e), the Imax, CD and PD increase sharply with increasing electric field and reach 35.55 A, 1132 A cm−2 and 215 MW cm−3, respectively, at 380 kV cm−1. For better evaluation of the power density of this contribution, a comparison of power density and the corresponding applied electric field between this work and recently reported lead-free ceramics is given in Fig. 4(f).27–29,51–56 Obviously, the power density is less than 100 MW cm−3 and the corresponding applied electric field is lower than 300 kV cm−1 for most lead-free ceramics in previous reports. It is worth noting that the power density is as high as 215 MW cm−3 (>3 × 104 MW kg−1) at a high applied electric field of 380 kV cm−1 in this work, which has great potential for pulsed power system applications.
In practical applications, the frequency stability, thermal stability and fatigue endurance of the dielectric capacitors are very important. Therefore, a representative S2 was chosen to evaluate the stability of the energy storage capability. Fig. 5(a–c) present the unipolar P–E loops of S2 under 300 kV cm−1 within 1–100 Hz, 1–105 cycle numbers and 30–160 °C, respectively. The corresponding polarizations (Pmax, Pr and Pmax − Pr) are displayed in Fig. S8(a)–(c).† It can be found that the P–E loops always maintain slim shapes along with small Pr (≤3.1 μC cm−2), and large Pmax (>32 μC cm−2) and Pmax − Pr (>29 μC cm−2) over a broad frequency range, cycle numbers and temperature range, indicating that the energy storage capability of S2 may include outstanding stability. Based on the P–E loops of Fig. 5(a)–(c), the calculated energy storage properties of Wtot, Wrec, Wloss and η as a function of frequency (1–100 Hz), cycle number (1–105) and temperature (30–160 °C) are presented in Fig. 5(d)–(f). As plotted in Fig. 5(d), the Wtot exceeds 3.2 J cm−3 while the Wloss is lower than 0.3 J cm−3 from 1 Hz to 100 Hz. What is encouraging is that the Wrec is higher than 3 J cm−3 and its variation is less than ±2% from 1 Hz to 100 Hz. Meanwhile, the η is over 91% in the measured frequency range. In addition, as shown in Fig. 5(e), the Wtot is around 3.6 J cm−3 and the Wloss still remained below 0.36 J cm−3 after 105 fatigue cycles. At the same time, the Wrec maintains 3.27 (±2%) J cm−3 and the η is always higher than 90% within 1–105 cycles. The outstanding cycling stability of energy storage capability for S2 helps to improve the reliability and stability of the capacitors. Moreover, the Wtot is still more than 3.2 J cm−3 while the Wloss is less than 0.5 J cm−3 within 30–160 °C (Fig. 5(f)). The Wrec can be maintained at around 3 J cm−3 and the stability (, where Wrec(T) denotes the value of Wrec at the testing temperature and the Wrec(30 °C) represents the value of Wrec at 30 °C) of Wrec remains at ± 6.5% together with high energy conversion efficiency (η > 85%) over a broad temperature range from 30 °C to 160 °C. Thus, the energy storage properties of S2 exhibited excellent thermal stability. A comparison of Wrec, η and the corresponding applied electric field for this study and other recently reported lead-free ceramics is presented in Fig. 5(g)–(i).27,43,54,57–64 Apparently, not only do the energy storage properties in this study include outstanding thermal stability, but also the Wrec, the η and the corresponding applied electric field are higher than previously reported. These above results indicate that the energy storage capability of S2 includes superior frequency stability, thermal stability and fatigue endurance, which has great potential for pulsed power systems in practical applications.

4. Conclusion
Lead-free ceramics with excellent energy storage capability and superior stability were constructed through a spatial sandwich structure design strategy and prepared by a tape casting method successfully. In the samples with a spatial sandwich structure, the internal electric field can be redistributed as a result of different dielectric constants of the BNBT and BNTSNA layers. Especially, a higher applied electric field can be realized for the samples with high Emax of BNTSNA in the outer layer. Meanwhile, the samples also possess large Pmax, small Pr and high Emax simultaneously. As a result, the reverse sandwich structured S2 exhibits the highest Wrec of 6.3 J cm−3 accompanied by high η of 93.6% at a high applied electric field of 540 kV cm−1. At the same time, ultrafast discharge time (t0.9 = 140 ns) and ultrahigh power density (215 MW cm−3) have been demonstrated in this study, which are superior to those of most reported lead-free ceramics. Furthermore, the energy storage properties included outstanding frequency stability, thermal stability and fatigue endurance. The variation of Wrec is less than ±2% along with high η (>90%) over a broad frequency range of 1–100 Hz and cycle numbers of 1–105, and the η still higher than 85% from 30 °C to 160 °C. The above results indicate that this work provides a new solution to explore high energy storage capability of lead-free ceramics via spatial structure design and promote the development of pulsed power systems.
