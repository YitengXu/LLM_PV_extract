    , Accepted 25th March 2019First published on 26th March 2019AbstractElementary semiconductors are rare and attractive, especially for low-dimensional materials. Unfortunately, most of the boron nanostructures have been found to be metallic, despite their typical semiconducting bulk structure. Herein, we propose a general recipe to realize low-dimensional semiconducting boron. This unusual semiconducting behavior is attributed to charge transfer and electron localization, induced by symmetry breaking that divides boron atoms into cations and anions. In addition, it is feasible to accomplish band gap engineering by rationally designing various structures. Importantly, the low-dimensional semiconducting boron allotropes are predicted to be an excellent solar-cell material with a power conversion efficiency of up to 22%, paving the way for their promising optoelectronic application.
1. Introduction
The filling of electronic bands has generally distinguished metals and insulators at zero temperature, depending on the position of the Fermi level, which lies in a band gap in insulators or inside a band for metals. In the bulk elements, metals possess a high number of coordinates with metallic characteristics due to electron delocalization, while the number of coordinates in most elementary semiconductors is low except in boron (B). The unique electron deficiency of boron enables the formation of complicated bonding in bulk boron phases,1 where the rhombohedral bulk is composed of highly symmetric icosahedral B12 in a crystalline state.1,2
Following the upsurge of graphene, a diverse array of atomically thin materials have been proposed due to their outstanding properties,3 such as few-layer black phosphorus and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), which can be designed as low-dimensional optoelectronic devices owing to their semiconducting character.4,5 Experimentally observed planar clusters (B35−, B36etc.) are considered to be the precursor for borophene,6–9 and boron monolayers have been achieved on silver (Ag) substrates with hexagonal vacancies of various concentrations and distributions,10 in agreement with first-principles calculations.11–13 Notably, there is a rich variety of bonding configurations for boron atoms, from two-center two-electron (2c-2e) bonds up to multicenter two-electron (nc-2e) bonds,14 and the flexible bond types between boron atoms lead to polymorphism of two-dimensional (2D) boron allotropes.15 In contrast to the semiconducting bulk,2,16 all the 2D boron allotropes experimentally synthesized are metallic,10 and the metallic features are due to out-of-plane pz-derived bands.17–19 Up to now, a number of unique metallic characteristics have been proposed in various 2D boron allotropes, including visible range plasmonics,20 Dirac cones,21,22 and superconductivity.23,24
The metallic character of low-dimensional boron is attributed to excess electrons induced by a high number of coordinates, e.g. high energy antibonding states are occupied in the triangular boron monolayer.17 In order to transfer excess electrons and decrease the electron delocalization, symmetry breaking is necessary, including the introduction of vacancy defects,17,18,25,26 forming local covalent B–B bonds, and chemical functionalization. A family of semiconducting boron monolayers have recently been predicted by our high-throughput screening,26 while the fundamental mechanism of the semiconducting property is still unclear.
As we know, the strong interlayer covalent B–B bonding between two triangular boron sublattices will enhance the structural stability of 2D boron allotropes.27,28 Based on the average electron compensation (AEC) mechanism,29 we show that there is an electron excess of 1/3e for every boron atom in an ideal triangular sheet. For a super-cell with 3n (n = 1, 2, …) boron atoms, 2n delocalized electrons will become localized by forming n covalent bonds between the upper and lower boron sheets. With the help of first-principles calculations, we have uncovered a general rule to rationally design stable semiconducting boron sandwiches with the realization of band gap engineering. Notably, we have revealed that the unusual semiconducting behavior in low-dimensional boron is attributed to symmetry breaking, as boron atoms may be divided into cations and anions, where the charge transfer will enhance electron localization. More importantly, the proposed semiconducting boron sandwich may be designed as a solar-cell material with high power conversion efficiency.
2. Computational details
All the first-principles calculations were based on density functional theory (DFT) implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP).30 The electron–ion interactions were described by projector augmented wave (PAW) potentials.31 To treat the exchange–correlation interaction of electrons, we chose the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional within the generalized-gradient approximation (GGA).32 In addition, the Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE06) hybrid functional33 and the quasi-particle G0W0 approach34 were applied for the band gap corrections, and the GW–Bethe–Salpeter equation (GW-BSE) approach35–38 was included to investigate the excitonic properties of the 2D semiconductors.
All the initial structures were fully relaxed until the force on each atom was smaller than −0.01 eV Å−1 with a cutoff energy of 480 eV. To avoid interaction between adjacent images, a vacuum region of 21 Å along the z direction was added to the model. To confirm the dynamical stability, phonon band structures were calculated with the finite displacement method as implemented in the Phonopy program.39 Thermal stability was also studied using ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations with the temperature controlled by a Nosé heat bath scheme.40
In our G0W0 calculations on compressed (−2%) R2, we used a 9 × 9 × 1 k-mesh for the Brillouin zone sampling and 261 empty bands (there are 27 occupied bands). The cutoff energy for the plane wave basis was set to be 450 eV, and the ENCUTGW was set to be 300 eV. Our test calculations showed that the above parameters ensured that the computed band gap had an accuracy of 0.05 eV. To plot the quasi-particle band structure, we used the approach of maximally localized Wannier functions.41,42 Other computational details and parameter definitions are presented in the ESI.†
3. Results and discussion
Based on the particle-swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm,43 prior theoretical works have researched the  bilayer (P6/mmm) and B6O sandwich.28,44 As shown in Fig. S1,† there is only one interlayer bond in the P6/mmm phase, which is in agreement with the average electron compensation (AEC) mechanism analysis. Similarly, the oxygen atom can gain 2e in the  bilayer triangular boron sublattices, which leads to the formation of a stable B6O sandwich. In addition, both the bilayer P6/mmm and B6O sandwich were proposed to possess unique double Dirac cones,28,44 and our calculations confirmed that the spin–orbit coupling (SOC) effect will open a very small energy gap (≈1 meV) for these two phases (shown in Fig. S1†).
For p(2 × 3) and p(3 × 3) bilayers, we constructed two typical 2D boron allotropes (denoted by R1 and R2) as shown in Fig. 1, with two/three interlayer bonds in R1/R2, respectively. As shown in Fig. 1(c and d), HSE06 band structure calculations confirmed that R1 and R2 phases are semiconductors with indirect band gaps of 0.305 eV and 1.428 eV, respectively. The projected band structure reveals that the valence band maximum (VBM) is dominated by the in-plane (s + px,y) orbitals and the out-of-plane (pz) orbitals, while the conduction band minimum (CBM) is mainly from the in-plane (s + px,y) orbitals. The relaxed structural parameters of R1 and R2 are listed in Table S1.† In addition, the phonon dispersions along all the high-symmetry lines and molecular dynamics snapshots at a higher temperature (see Fig. S2†) indicate that our proposed new phases have high dynamic and thermal stabilities.

The cyan and green atoms in (a, b) represent the boron atoms involved in the interlayer bonds. (c, d) The projected HSE06 band structures of R1 and R2 (VBM is set to 0). 
In order to explore the possibility of growing boron sandwiches on metal substrates, we show the thermodynamic phase diagram of the B/metal systems in Fig. 2. As we know, several boron monolayers have been fabricated on the Ag(111) substrate by the molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) method, including β12, χ310 and the metastable α sheet.45 Clearly, the phase diagrams indicate that the monolayer boron phases on various metal substrates are more stable than the boron films under B-poor conditions. However, the synthesis of atomically thin γ28 film on copper foils has been realized by the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method.46 The experimental work showed that the deposited boron would diffuse into the catalytic Cu substrate, and since the system reaches super-saturation, the boron would nucleate as thin film to counteract the continuous feeding of B onto the substrates.46 The formation energies in the phase diagram indicate that B-rich conditions will stabilize the boron films on the metal substrates, since the semiconducting R1 sandwich is more stable than the experimental γ28 film on Cu(111) substrates, revealing the possibility of fabricating 2D semiconducting boron allotropes by controlling growth conditions. Notably, absorption spectroscopy analysis demonstrated the semiconducting nature of the experimental boron γ28 film,46 while calculations showed that the γ28 film is metallic.47 Since the R1 sandwich is more stable than the γ28 film on the metal substrates, we are inclined to believe that the new semiconducting phases proposed by us are close to the phases detected by the experiments.

As shown in Fig. S3,† we analyzed the features of interlayer B–B bonds in R1 and R2 by calculating the electron localization function (ELF), demonstrating the electron localization around B–B bonds in the top (bottom) planes and the interlayer B4/B6 units. The 2D ELF plots for the sliced planes in Fig. S3† also indicate strongly covalent electrons in the interlayer B–B bonds, in agreement with the Bader charge analysis, showing charge transfer of 0.55e (0.87e) from the B4-rectangle (B6-trigonal-prism) to the neighboring boron planes. The above mechanism is analogous with the former 2D sandwich metal borides,48 where the boron planes and metal plane act as the “anions” and “cations”, respectively. Based on the structure recognition algorithm,49 we have performed a full screening of possible 2D boron allotropes using p(2 × 3) and p(3 × 3) super-cells with 2/3 interlayer bonds. Our high-throughput electronic property screening revealed that R1 and R2 are unique semiconductors, implying that the distribution and concentration of the interlayer bonds codetermine the presence of semiconducting properties.
In the past decade, the planar boron monolayers have been concluded to be metallic, characterized by delocalized out-of-plane pz-derived bands.1,17–19 Herein, the projected density of states (PDOS) analysis (see Fig. S4†) demonstrated that the interlayer B–B bonds would realize the localization of metallic pz orbitals, where there is a sharp increase of pz electrons from the boron planes to the B6 units. However, the PDOS analysis fails to explain the semiconductor behavior, since the distributions of pz orbitals are almost the same for the semiconducting phase R2 and the metallic phase M2a, as shown in Fig. S4.† Similarly, the semiconducting boron monolayers predicted by us26 demonstrated that a special combination rule induces the energy gap opening of both in-plane and out-of-plane orbitals, which cannot be explained by the PDOS analysis.
From the perspective of charge transfer, we can confirm the localization of the “neutral” part in the first semiconducting monolayer β1S (ref. 26) (shown in Fig. 3a), and the four typical semiconducting boron monolayers26 meet the same rule of isolated charge-neutral regions (shown in Fig. S5†). For the bilayer p(2 × 3) R1 and M1, boron atoms from the interlayer bonds act the role of the “cations” part, while the “neutral” part in the semiconducting R1 is surrounded by the ionic regions. Next, we compared the charge distribution of R2 isomers with three interlayer bonds (shown in Fig. 3(d–f)). The Bader charge analysis shows that there is charge depletion in the interlayer B6 triangular prism of R2 (i.e., the “cations” part), and the charge will be accepted by the B3 triangle on the upper/lower planes (i.e., the “anions” part). There is no charge transfer in the other B3 triangle, e.g. “neutral” part. As shown in Fig. 3(d), the “cations” and “anions” triangles form a honeycomb lattice with the “neutral” triangle trapped in the center of a hexagon. The large gap of R2 is attributed to the charge transfer from the “cations” triangles to the “anions” ones, similar to the well-known boron nitride monolayer. For the metallic M2a in Fig. 3(e), the charge transfer is mainly from two B atoms to one B atom, and thus the “neutral” B atoms form a connected network, which induces the metallic character. Similarly, the “neutral” B atoms in metallic M1 and M2b (Fig. 3(c and f)) form a periodic chain beside the chain comprising the “cations” and “anions” triangles. Therefore, the connected network formed by the “neutral” B atoms may act as a delocalized metallic channel, and the semiconducting behavior is attributed to the symmetry breaking and charge localization.

The values presented here are the average value of the given color regions (d, f) or the color atoms (a, b, c and e). The blue atoms represent the boron atoms involved in the interlayer bonds in (b–f). 
To obtain a more comprehensive view of the effect of covalent bonding, we considered the surface decoration by hydrogen (H) adsorption on a boron ideal monolayer, where the B–H bond of the adsorption site is a strong covalent bond. Following the idea of the AEC mechanism, we tested adsorption of 2–5 H atoms using 6–15 times super-cells (see Fig. S6†). The band structures in Fig. S7† reveal that all these hydrogen adsorption systems are semiconductors. The strong B–H interactions lead to the redistribution of electron density, which can be confirmed by the obvious charge transfer of B/H atoms. For the RH-2 phase in Fig. 4(a and b), there is charge transfer of 0.524e from each B atom to H atom at the adsorption site, and therefore the B atoms can be divided into three parts (“cations”, “anions” and “neutral”), which is in agreement with the charge distribution in the R2 sandwich. For the RH-3 phase in Fig. 4(c and d), there are two kinds of H atoms in the “Y”-like adsorption configuration, and the center H atom obtains less negative charge from the B atom. The inequivalent adsorption sites of RH-3 lead to high deformation of the B triangular plane, and there are five kinds of B atoms based on the charge transfer analysis. Similarly, both the “neutral” regions in the above two semiconducting 2D B–H systems are disconnected by the charged regions, indicating the universality of semiconducting behavior in low-dimensional boron.

The values presented here are the average values of the given color regions (b) or the color atoms (d). 
In the following, we focus on the possible band gap engineering of low-dimensional boron and the potential applications. With high-throughput screening, we have found two new phases (R3, R4) that are semiconductors with indirect band gaps of 0.862 eV and 0.975 eV, respectively (shown in Fig. 5(a)), and the phonon dispersion and AIMD simulations (shown in Fig. S8†) indicate the two sandwiches have high dynamic and thermal stabilities. Interestingly, R3 and R4 can be viewed as the derivative products of R1 and R2, indicating a general rule to design 2D semiconducting boron allotropes based on the two basic unit cells of R1(TA) and R2(TB). As shown in Fig. 5(b), various 2D boron allotropes will be obtained by modulating the numbers and sequences of the two parts (A, B) in the super-cell (Tm×A+n×B). The hybrid functional band structure calculations have confirmed that all the designed sandwiches are semiconductors (shown in Fig. S12†), and the band gaps of new phases are located in the range of TA (0.305 eV) and TB (1.428 eV). As shown in Fig. 5(d), the band gaps of the corresponding structures increase with the increasing proportion (n/m + n) of TB in the super-cell. Notably, structures with the same ratio may result in various band gaps, for example, the band gap of TABAAB is much larger than that of TAABBA. Thus, both the ratio of A/B and the orders of basic parts (A, B) in the super-cell will modulate the band gaps of these low-dimensional boron structures. As shown in Table S1,† the average formation energy (Eform) difference of the new sandwiches is smaller than 0.03 eV per atom owing to the close stability of TA and TB. All of the new semiconducting phases are more stable than the boron monolayers18 and P6/mmm,28 and R3 is more stable than the semimetallic Pmmn.27 The dynamic and thermodynamic stabilities for the new phases in Fig. 5(d) are confirmed by the phonon dispersions along the high-symmetry lines and AIMD simulations (shown in Fig. S10 and S11†).

For potential applications in real systems, 2D semiconductors should be grown on a flexible substrate, where the strain effect due to lattice mismatch would inevitably need be considered. As shown in Fig. 6(a), the HSE06 band gap of R2 would be effectively modulated with the biaxial strain from 1.23 to 1.58 eV. Notably, the R2 sandwich would be transformed into a direct gap semiconductor under 2% compression strain. In order to obtain the accurate quasi-particle (QP) band gap (Eg), we have calculated the G0W0 band structure of compressed (−2%) R2, showing its fundamental band gap of 1.48 eV in Fig. 6(b). The inset of Fig. 6(b) shows the calculated G0W0-BSE spectrum of compressed (−2%) R2, and the optical gap is 1.16 eV, indicated by the first peak of the absorption spectrum. The corresponding exciton binding energy (Eb) obtained here is 0.32 eV, which satisfies the linear scaling law (Eb ≈ Eg/4) of 2D semiconductors.50

It is well known that semiconductors with a direct gap of around 1.4 eV are ideal candidates as solar absorption materials. The band-edge energies VBM (valence band maximum) and CBM (conduction band minimum) of compressed (−2%) R2 are −4.97 eV and −3.49 eV, respectively. Matching band alignment with appropriate semiconducting acceptors, R2 with the direct band gap is a promising solar cell donor material. Based on the band-gap-center approximation,51 we have checked the QP band-edge energies of many 2D semiconductors, and found three potential acceptors (black-P, MoS2 and WS2) to form a type-II heterojunction alignment with compressed (−2%) R2 (Fig. 6(c)). The definition of power conversion efficiency (PCE) η is provided in the ESI.† As shown in Fig. 6(d), solar cell systems constructed with WS2/R2 and black-P/R2 can achieve PCEs as high as ∼22%/20.7%, and the PCE of MoS2/R2 is 18.1%. The above computed values are comparable to the former proposed bilayer phosphorene/MoS2 heterojunctions (16–18%),52 hybrid PCBM/CBN heterojunctions (10–20%)53 and g-SiC2 based systems (12–20%) for highly efficient solar cells.54 Notably, for the 2D B–H systems, there are many semiconductors with direct band gap. For example the hybrid functional band gap of RH-3a in Fig. S7† is 1.18 eV, indicating their potential applications for advanced optoelectronic devices.
4. Conclusions
In summary, we have theoretically predicted 2D semiconducting boron allotropes by effectively introducing symmetry breaking and charge transfer in the triangular boron sheet. The semiconducting behavior is attributed to the charge transfer among boron atoms from different regions, where the neutral region should be isolated. Remarkably, the model of isolated charge-neutral regions is a general rule, which is applicable to both semiconducting boron sheets and boron sandwiches. This universal mechanism is also verified by metallic triangular boron sheets with hydrogen adsorption. By modulating the ratio and orders of the two basic parts (R1, R2) in the unit cell, various stable boron sandwiches are designed to realize band-gap engineering. The predicted PCE for WS2/R2 heterojunctions can be as high as 22%, rendering this system an efficient candidate for use in flexible optoelectronic devices. It is expected that the proposed 2D semiconducting boron allotropes should be synthesized on metal substrates under B-rich conditions, and the proposed boron allotropes are promising materials for high-efficiency boron-based solar cells. The discovery of semiconducting phases provides more opportunities for future research on 2D boron allotropes. We believe that the introduction of both vacancies and interlayer bonds for the boron bilayers may build various 2D boron allotropes with new properties, and deserves deeper systematic study.
