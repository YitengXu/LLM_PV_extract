, Accepted 30th July 2013First published on 31st July 2013AbstractIn this work, we report our effort to understand the photocurrent generation that is contributed via electron–exciton interaction at the donor/acceptor interface in organic solar cells (OSCs). Donor/acceptor bi-layer heterojunction OSCs, of the indium tin oxide/copper phthalocyanine (CuPc)/fullerene (C60)/molybdenum oxide/Al type, were employed to study the mechanism of photocurrent generation due to the electron–exciton interaction, where CuPc and C60 are the donor and the acceptor, respectively. It is shown that the electron–exciton interaction and the exciton dissociation processes co-exist at the CuPc/C60 interface in OSCs. Compared to conventional donor/acceptor bi-layer OSCs, the cells with the above configuration enable holes to be extracted at the C60 side while electrons can be collected at the CuPc side, resulting in a photocurrent in the reverse direction. The photocurrent thus observed is contributed to primarily by the charge carriers that are generated by the electron–exciton interaction at the CuPc/C60 interface, while charges derived from the exciton dissociation process also exist at the same interface. The mechanism of photocurrent generation due to electron–exciton interaction in the OSCs is further investigated, and it is manifested by the transient photovoltage characteristics and the external quantum efficiency measurements.
1. Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted a lot of attention in recent years due to their potential for large scale manufacturing and low cost.1–4 The power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) and lifetimes of OSCs have been improved in order to compete in the market which is dominated by silicon-based solar cells.5–7 However, the process of converting excitons (the excited electron–hole pairs which are tightly bound together) to free carriers in OSCs, which is the essential step for light-to-electricity conversion, is still not very clear.8 Many results have shown that the excitons at the donor/acceptor (D/A) interface firstly experience the short geminate pair of carriers (SGP)9,10 or charge transfer (CT) states,11,12 leaving the holes on one side while transferring the electrons to the other side of the interface or vice versa, leaving the electrons on one side while transferring the holes to the other side of the interface. Then those CT states are further separated into free carriers or regenerated into excitons.13,14 As a result, CT states, excitons and the free carriers coexist at the interface and might interact with each other. It is known that the singlet–singlet annihilation, singlet–charge annihilation, and bimolecular charge recombination could reduce the number of excitons or charges, leading to a decrease in the photocurrent generation in the solar cell.15–17 However, these processes might also contribute to the photocurrent generation if the solar cells are designed to be able to capture the carriers from these processes. For example, it has been proposed by Song et al.,18 that the photocurrent can be generated in an n–n type solar cell through intermolecular exciton recombination. Another type of photocurrent generation, different from the traditional exciton dissociation method, is through carrier–exciton interaction.19–25 Recent studies show that depending on the materials used, the carrier–exciton interaction can be the dominant process at the interface in terms of quenching excitons.20,21 The quenching of an exciton by a charge can be achieved via Förster energy transfer to a charged species (S1 + h,e → S0 + h,e*)22 or by charge transfer (S1 + h,e → h,e + S0),23,24 for example by the electron transfer from the (poly-[2-methoxy-5-(2′-ethylhexyloxy)-p-phenylenevinylene]) (MEH-PPV) excited state to a positive charge in the (N,N-bis(3-methylphenyl)-N,N-diphenylbenzidene) (TPD) layer, neutralizing the positive charge in the TPD while creating a positive charge in the MEH-PPV.23 Thus, after exciton quenching through a charge–exciton interaction, an energetic charge ready for charge transfer or an already transferred charge is obtained for subsequent carrier collection. Of course ground state charge transfer23,24 or energy dissipation via a phonon19,25 would strongly compete with carrier collection by the electrodes. This might be the reason for the absence of an experimental report about the photocurrent generated from this charge–exciton interaction. In this study we provide evidence for the photocurrent produced through the interaction between electrons and excitons at the CuPc/C60 D/A interface. Our results show that the charge carriers derived from the exciton dissociation and the electron–exciton interaction processes coexist at the CuPc/C60 D/A interface. By adjusting these two processes at the interface, the charges produced due to the electron–exciton interaction can dominate in the photocurrent generation as compared to the exciton dissociation process at the D/A interface in OSCs.
2. Experimental
OSCs based on phthalocyanine (CuPc)/fullerene (C60) were fabricated under high-vacuum (∼1 × 10−6 Pa) using a molecular beam deposition system. The pre-patterned indium tin oxide (ITO) was cleaned by an ultrasonic cleaning machine (KQ3200DV) with 4% detergent (Decon 90) in deionized water at 60 °C. The film thickness and the film deposition rate were monitored in situ using quartz crystal. The deposition rates were 1 nm min−1 for CuPc, tris-8-hydroxy-quinolinato aluminum (Alq3) and molybdenum oxide (MoO3), and 2 nm min−1 for C60. The effective area of the OSCs was 2.0 × 3.0 mm2. OSCs possessing the same active layers of CuPc and C60 but different top electrodes of Alq3/Al and MoO3/Al were fabricated simultaneously. The composite MoO3/Al electrode with a high work function26 was used. After deposition, the devices were transferred into a glove box with an atmosphere containing less than 3 ppm H2O and O2 for testing. The current density–voltage (I–V) characteristics were measured using a Keithley2400 source meter with/without AM1.5G simulated light from a Newport simulator (model 94043A). The transient photovoltage characteristics were measured through recording the photovoltage variation with time with an oscilloscope after a burst of illumination from a pulsed laser. The oscilloscope was a DSO-X3102A (Agilent Technologies) with a band width of 1 GHz and the pulsed laser was a Polaris II (New Wave Research) with a FWHW of ∼4 ns. All of the voltages were relative to the Al electrode. The monochromatic light was supplied by a xenon arc lamp and modulated by a mechanical chopper. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the OSCs was calculated from the measured photocurrent generated from the modulated monochromatic light by a lock-in technique.
3. Results and discussion
Fig. 1 shows the I–V characteristics measured for devices A [ITO/CuPc (15 nm)/C60 (60 nm)/Alq3 (10 nm)/Al (100 nm)] and B [ITO/CuPc (15 nm)/C60 (60 nm)/MoO3 (10 nm)/Al (100 nm)], both in the dark and under AM1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2). The open-circuit voltage (Voc) and the short-circuit current density (Isc) are 0.45 V and −3.98 mA cm−2 for device A and −0.74 V and 0.368 mA cm−2 for device B, respectively. The negative photocurrent in device A indicates that holes are being collected by the ITO electrode. In contrast, the positive photocurrent observed in device B suggests that the direction of the photocurrent is different, resulting from the alternation in the electrode polarity from Alq3/Al to MoO3/Al. By using a 550 nm cut-on filter, light with a wavelength of shorter than 550 nm is filtered out. The insertion of this 550 nm cut-on filter reduced the Isc of device A to −2.73 mA cm−2 and to almost zero (0.007 mA cm−2) for device B.

Besides the difference in the I–V characteristics, the transient photovoltage (TPV) and EQE of the OSCs having two different top electrodes are quite different. Fig. 2 shows the TPV of the two devices under illumination by a 532 nm pulsed laser with and without light bias. Device B shows positive TPVs while negative signals are observed for device A, consistent with the current polarity as shown in Fig. 1. Steady state white light produced by a tungsten lamp shifts the baseline negatively and positively for devices A and B respectively. As shown in Fig. 2, device A under red light bias produced a larger baseline shift compared to under blue light. However, the baseline of device B does not change under different intensities of red light bias. The large TPV transitions observed in device A are also consistent with its high Isc in comparison with device B.
 Fig. 2  (a) Transient photovoltage of devices A and B after illumination with a 532 nm pulsed laser with and without light bias. The blue and red light biases were obtained by attaching band pass filters of 450 nm and 620 nm, respectively, to the white light source. (b) The transmittance of the blue and red band pass filter. 
Fig. 3 displays the spectral responses measured for the two devices with and without light bias in the wavelength range from 350–750 nm. There is no change in the EQE of device A with or without light bias, but the contribution above 550 nm in device B disappears after illuminating with white light. Another difference with respect to device A is that the EQE of device B increases under light bias in the wavelength range of 350–530 nm. The missing contribution to the EQE in the wavelength range of 550–750 nm under white light bias is consistent with the Isc of almost zero measured using a 550 nm cut-on filter, as shown in Fig. 1, indicating the existence of a displacement current.27,28 The steady state white light is used here to mimic the real working conditions of the devices. Indeed, the calculated Isc using the EQE of device B in the presence of white light bias under AM1.5G illumination is quite close to the Isc shown in Fig. 1. Another distinct feature of the EQE of device B is the location of the first peak, which is at a wavelength corresponding to a region of low EQE for device A.
 Fig. 3  The EQE of devices A (a) and B (b) measured at a chopper frequency of 272 Hz, with and without light bias. The light bias is the same as that used in the TPV measurements. 
Fig. 4 shows the EQEs and phases of the two devices under different chopper frequencies without light bias. All of the EQE spectra are identical for device A under different chopper frequencies, and the phase also remains unchanged. However both the EQE and the phase of device B vary with the chopper frequency. In the wavelength range of 350–530 nm, the EQE of device B decreases as frequency increases, and the phase remains approximately zero. But in the wavelength range of 550–750 nm, the EQE of device B increases as the frequency increases, while it shifts to being almost out of phase, obviously different to the stable phase of device A observed in the full spectrum.

Fig. 5 shows the EQEs and phases of the two devices under different intensities of modulated monochromatic light. Similar to Fig. 4, all of the EQEs are identical for device A and it exhibits the same phase response. In the wavelength range of 350–530 nm, the EQE of device B increases with the intensity of light, and the phase remains approximately zero. But in the wavelength range of 550–750 nm, the EQE of device B decreases with increasing light intensity, and it shifts to being almost out of phase.

In order to better understand the above phenomena, the schematic energy diagrams of the two OSCs of ITO/CuPc/C60/Alq3/Al and ITO/CuPc/C60/MoO3/Al are shown in Fig. 6.29–31 Since devices A and B have identical active bi-layers of CuPc/C60, the opposite photocurrent directions observed in the two OSCs must be the result of the different electrodes used. In device A, the photo-generated excitons from both the CuPc donor and the C60 acceptor are dissociated at the CuPc/C60 interface. Thus the EQE response of device A corresponds to the absorption spectra of the active layer. Blocking light with the 550 nm cut-on filter (Fig. 1) can only reduce the number of excitons (most of those produced in C60) that can then dissociate at the CuPc/C60 interface, and therefore reduce the magnitude of photocurrent (from −3.98 to −2.73 mA cm−2) in device A. The efficient exciton dissociation and charge collection in device A indicate that the photocurrent generated from modulated monochromatic light increases linearly with the intensity of light. The photocurrent will not be affected by light bias since exciton annihilation and charge–exciton annihilation can be ignored under normal illuminated conditions.21,25 Thus the EQE is not dependent on light bias and the intensity of modulated monochromatic light, as shown in Fig. 3 and 5.

The working principle of device B is quite different from that of device A. The high work function MoO3 contact results in the direction of the built-in electric field pointing from the ITO layer towards the Al layer in device B. The excitons in the C60 can be separated at the C60/MoO3 interface with the help of the MoO3 buffer.32 Therefore the EQE peaks at around 405 nm in device B can be explained as the result of an optical filtering effect.33 Since excitons generated from strongly absorbed light are far away from the C60/MoO3 interface, but weakly absorbed light would penetrate into the device and produce excitons near the C60/MoO3 interface, the exciton dissociation at the C60/MoO3 interface would result in a peak at the minima of the absorption spectrum of C60. To complete the exciton dissociation at the C60/MoO3 interface and obtain a positive Isc as shown in Fig. 1, the holes must be excited from C60 to MoO3 and then be collected by the Al electrode, which has been demonstrated before.32,34 The electrons remaining in C60 diffuse and drift towards the CuPc/C60 interface from the C60/MoO3 interface under the built-in electric field in device B. It is unlikely that the electrons which reach the CuPc/C60 interface can be excited over or tunnel through the necessary ∼1.0 eV energy barrier at the CuPc/C60 interface. To finish their journey, the accumulated electrons at the CuPc/C60 interface must gain enough energy to overcome the energy barrier of ∼1.0 eV or transfer from C60 to CuPc by a certain path. Here we propose that the electrons overcome the high energy barrier through charge transfer, and one possible pathway for this to occur is through electron–exciton interaction. The charge transfer is realized through recombination of the electrons from the C60 side with the holes in the excitons of CuPc. After this charge transfer, the C60 is neutralized and the CuPc becomes negatively charged.24,25 Those free electrons on CuPc are then forced by the built-in electric field to move away from the CuPc/C60 interface and towards the ITO electrode. In brief, the provision of electrons by the exciton dissociation at the C60/MoO3 interface and the electron–exciton interaction at the CuPc/C60 interface (where excitons are supplied by CuPc) generate the steady state photocurrent in device B in the wavelength range of 350–530 nm. It is not likely that electrons can gain enough energy via Föster energy transfer to overcome the high energy barrier because the exciton of CuPc is non-emissive, which is not conducive to Föster energy transfer from CuPc to C60.22 Another possible way for the electrons in C60 to gain enough energy is via an Auger-like process,35 i.e. the energy released from exciton recombination is used to excite the electrons in C60.
The exciton dissociation in device A and the electron–exciton interaction for electron transfer in device B proposed above happen at the same CuPc/C60 interface. Obviously, charge–exciton interaction in device A and exciton dissociation in device B may also occur simultaneously. For the exciton dissociation process, photocurrent generation depends only on the number of excitons at the interface, from either CuPc or C60. Thus exciton dissociation can fully explain the negative TPV signals as shown in Fig. 2 and also the negative shifting under light bias. However, in the photocurrent generation through electron–exciton interaction in device B, free electrons generated in the CuPc depend not only on the exciton on the CuPc side, but also on the electrons on the C60 side.20,23,24 The 532 nm pulsed laser light can be absorbed by CuPc and C60 to fulfill the requirement for electron–exciton interaction mentioned above, and the same applied under white and blue light bias. Thus a positive TPV signal and a positive baseline shifting can be observed under white and blue light biases, as shown in Fig. 2. However, red light can only be absorbed by CuPc and therefore there are no free electrons20 generated at the C60/MoO3 interface for electron–exciton interaction under red light bias. This is the reason why no baseline shift is observed in device B under red light bias, as shown in Fig. 2.
The above analysis indicates that the exciton dissociation at the C60/MoO3 interface (to provide free electrons) and the electron–exciton interaction at the CuPc/C60 interface (to facilitate electron transfer from C60 to CuPc via electron–exciton interaction) should happen at the same time to produce the measurable steady state photocurrent in device B. The 550 nm cut-on band pass filter can filter out light with wavelengths shorter than 550 nm, and only CuPc can absorb light with wavelengths >550 nm. In the absence of light being absorbed by C60, the exciton dissociation at the C60/MoO3 interface no longer occurs and therefore electrons no longer accumulate at the CuPc/C60 interface. The electron–exciton interaction and the resulting quantity of free electrons in CuPc generated by this interaction are therefore dramatically decreased, making exciton dissociation the dominant process under these conditions. This is the reason for the very small photocurrent (0.007 mA cm−2) observed for device B, under steady light illumination using the 550 nm cut-on filter, as shown in Fig. 1.
The apparent EQE without light bias for device B in the wavelength range of 550–750 nm, shown in Fig. 3, is attributed to the displacement current. The phase changes shown in Fig. 4d and 5d also confirm that the apparent EQE of device B in the wavelength range of 550–750 nm arise due to the displacement current. When the modulated light in the wavelength range of 550–750 nm strikes the device, the light is only absorbed by the CuPc layer. As mentioned above, electron–exciton interaction is dramatically reduced due to the lack of exciton dissociation at the C60/MoO3 interface. However, exciton dissociation at the CuPc/C60 interface still exists and becomes the dominant process in the wavelength range of 550–750 nm. The exciton dissociation at this interface generates electrons on the C60 side and holes on the CuPc side. The concentration gradient makes the free carriers diffuse away from the interface where they are generated. The opposite drifting effect finally stops these diffusing carriers in the device, resulting in the displacement current (pointing from the Al electrode towards the ITO electrode), i.e. though the carriers move away from their site of generation in the device, they are not collected by the electrodes in device B. If not measured under steady state, as we do here by modulating the light with a chopper, the displacement current can be detected, as shown in Fig. 3–5 without light bias. A white light bias would produce excitons in both the CuPc and C60 layers. Electrons are generated by exciton dissociation at the CuPc/C60 interface or the C60/MoO3 interface in device B, and they then accumulate at the CuPc/C60 interface due to the built-in electric field and the large energy barrier for electron transfer at the interface, as shown in Fig. 6b. Some of the electrons would be lost through recombination with the holes (generated by exciton dissociation at the CuPc/C60 interface) gathered at the CuPc side of the interface, and some of the electrons would transfer to CuPc via electron–exciton interaction, producing the positive baseline shifting seen in Fig. 2. The superimposition of modulated monochromatic light generates additional excitons to interact with those electrons accumulated at the CuPc/C60 interface. When the modulated monochromatic light is in the wavelength range of 350–530 nm, it can be absorbed both by CuPc and C60, making electron–exciton interaction the dominant process in device B. The pre-existence of electrons at the CuPc/C60 interface enhances the interaction between the electrons and the excitons generated from the modulated monochromatic light. This is the reason why the EQE increases in the wavelength range of 350–530 nm under light bias. However, the pre-existence of electrons at the CuPc/C60 interface also decreases exciton dissociation from the modulated monochromatic light by quenching the excitons, thus diminishing the apparent EQE (displacement current) in the wavelength range of 550–750 nm under light bias, as shown in Fig. 3.
A similar argument concerning the pre-existence of electrons leading to enhanced electron–exciton interaction and decreased exciton dissociation applies to the EQE variation in device B under different chopper frequencies and light intensities. Both decreasing the chopper frequency and increasing the monochromatic light intensity would allow more electrons to accumulate at the CuPc/C60 interface. In the wavelength range of 350–530 nm, photocurrent generation via electron–exciton interaction is the dominant mechanism in device B, thus the EQE is enhanced with decreasing chopper frequency (as shown in Fig. 4c) or increasing monochromatic light intensity (as shown in Fig. 5c). However, the dominant process in the wavelength range of 550–750 nm changes to exciton dissociation due to the lack of exciton dissociation at the C60/MoO3 interface in this range. Thus the decrease in exciton dissociation at the CuPc/C60 interface accounts for the decrease in the EQE in the wavelength range of 550–750 nm with decreasing chopper frequency (as shown in Fig. 4c) or increasing monochromatic light intensity (as shown in Fig. 5c).
The ceasing of the exciton dissociation process at the C60/MoO3 interface and the electron–exciton interaction at the CuPc/C60 interface result in the exciton dissociation at the CuPc/C60 interface (the displacement current generation) becoming the dominant process under light with wavelengths >550 nm, in EQE measurements without light bias. The coexistence of exciton dissociation and electron–exciton interaction in device B at the CuPc/C60 interface indicates that these two processes might also coexist in device A. As discussed above, excitons from either CuPc or C60 in device A are dissociated at the CuPc/C60 interface, and then the free carriers are effectively collected by the electrodes with the help of the built-in electric field. The efficient transport of free carriers away from the CuPc/C60 interface might be the reason for the undetectable electron–exciton (hole–exciton) interaction in device A. By reversing the built-in electric field in device B, electrons can be accumulated at the CuPc/C60 interface to enhance the electron–exciton interaction, generating a positive photocurrent in device B. The positive photocurrent observed in device B also has a contribution from exciton recombination across the CuPc/C60 interface, as proposed elsewhere.18 When excitons are produced at both sides of the CuPc/C60 interface, electrons in the excitons of C60 would recombine with holes in the excitons of CuPc to generate free holes in C60 and free electrons in CuPc, respectively.18 Due to the large exciton dissociation at the C60/MoO3 interface, the contribution from this interfacial exciton recombination should be minor.
4. Conclusion
In summary, the results of a comprehensive investigation of photocurrent generation in ITO/CuPc/C60/MoO3/Al-type bi-layer heterojunction OSCs are presented. A new process for photocurrent generation through electron–exciton interaction is revealed by analyzing the I–V characteristics, transient photovoltage, EQE and the phase of the device. The electrons involved in this electron–exciton interaction are primarily generated by the exciton dissociation at the C60/MoO3 interface. The electron–exciton interaction occurring at the CuPc/C60 interface is responsible for the photocurrent generation, in the reverse direction to the photocurrent generated by the exciton dissociation process at the same interface, commonly seen in conventional organic solar cells. Though the excitons are still dissociated at the CuPc/C60 interface, the free carriers generated by exciton dissociation can not be collected by the electrodes of the ITO/CuPc/C60/MoO3/Al device. The process of free carrier generation via the electron–exciton interaction is identified and verified. The finding of photocurrent generation through charge–exciton interaction provides insight for the better understanding of the efficient operation of excitonic organic solar cells.
