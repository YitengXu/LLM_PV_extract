    , Accepted 30th March 2013First published on 8th April 2013AbstractLight-emitting diodes (LEDs) based on colloidal quantum dots (QDs) have attracted considerable attention due to their potential in applications such as color-saturated displays and white light with high color-rendering index. However, cadmium-based QD-LEDs are strictly regulated in industrial applications because of the high toxicity of cadmium. As an alternative, InP-based cadmium-free QDs are recommended owing to their wide emission range that is comparable to that of CdSe, and their environmentally friendly properties when applied to QD-LEDs and white QD-LEDs. This feature article provides an overview of QDs' merits in display and light-emitting applications as well as a discussion of their color tunability, photo-stability, and high luminescence efficiency.

1 Introduction
Recently colloidal quantum dots (QDs) have received great attention due to their potential in applications such as solar cells,17–23 biological imaging,34–39 photodetectors,24–30 and light-emitting diodes (LEDs)31–33 because they exhibit prominent properties such as good photo-stability, high luminescence efficiency and facile color tunability by the quantum confinement effect, and cheap solution processability.1–7 Especially the CQDs, emitting the light by optical or electrical excitation, are considered as candidates for next-generation emitting materials owing to their high color purity, good quantum yield, and wide color reliability. QD-LEDs have considerable interest for applications such as thin film displays with improved color saturation and white light with a high color rendering index (CRI).
In general, QD-based LEDs can be simply classified as down-conversion and electroluminescent (EL) LED devices. The former utilizes the QDs as phosphors exhibiting photoluminescence (PL) in the visible region by the excitation from the light of substrate LEDs. Nexxus Lighting, LG,8,9 QD vision,10,11 and Samsung12–14 have been developing these devices as back-lit display units. In contrast to down-conversion LEDs using single-phase QD compositions, EL QD-LED devices have been often constructed as multilayered structures in between electrodes. As the active region that generates light, QDs are positioned between layers commonly made of indium tin oxide (ITO), a transparent material that can conduct electrons. For this type of device, a common problem is the interaction between the individual particles, which can cause energy transfer leading to faster degradation of the device itself.15 To overcome this problem, new organic or inorganic hole-transporting materials (HTMs) and QDs that are highly stable are necessary.
This feature article provides an overview of QDs designed for efficient down-conversion, electroluminescent QD-LED devices, and micro-contact and inkjet printing using cadmium based and cadmium free QDs.
2 Terminology
The general definition of the terminology used in the LED as follows.
External quantum efficiency (EQE) is the ratio of the emitted photons from the device to the injected electrons.  i: electrical current, e: electron charge, hv: photon energy, P0: output power, ηex: external quantum efficiency.
Turn-on-voltage is a required voltage to conduct an appreciable amount of current across the diode in the forward direction. In short, it is the applied voltage needed to recognize the minimum light emitting.
Color rendering index (CRI or Ra) means a quantitative value of a light source's ability to reproduce a real object's color under daylight. It is usually compared with a reference light source of the same color temperature.
Correlative color temperature (CCT) is a numerical value of a light source, which is measured in degrees Kelvin (K). White light has a value between around 5000 K (warm white) and 10000 K (cool white).
Luminous efficiency and efficacy are not same strictly, but commonly used as the similar meaning. In this manuscript, it represents the amount of emitted light per unit power.
3 Quantum dots
3.1 Definition of quantum dots
Typically the semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs) are composed to a few hundred to ten thousand atoms. Hence the typical dimension of NCs lies around 1–10 nm, which is generally smaller than the exciton Bohr radius (the distance in an electron–hole pair).16 When their excitons are confined in all three spatial dimensions, the NCs are called to quantum dots and their electronic characteristics become strongly size-dependent owing to the quantum confinement effect.1–7 Consequently, the NCs exhibit physical properties in between bulk semiconductor solids and individual molecules (Fig. 1(a)). In general, light absorption and emission depend on the bandgap offset (Eg), which is the lowest energy required to excite an electron to jump from the valence band to the vacant conduction band, and the Eg can be simply controlled by the shape, size, composition, and structure including the core–shell of the NCs. The QDs can be roughly classified into epitaxial and colloidal QDs by the synthetic method as shown in Fig. 1(b). The epitaxial QDs can be systematically produced on a solid crystalline substrate in a definite range of shapes and sizes through the epitaxial growth but this method has a limited application in opto-electronic devices requiring multiply stacked QDs. In contrast, the colloidal QDs have versatility in applications such as bio-conjugation and optoelectronic devices because the size, shape, structure and mono-dispersity of colloidal QDs can be easily controlled by the solution hot-injection method using organometallic precursors. The great versatility of colloidal QDs seems to originate from the surface ligand of colloidal QDs because it not only prevents aggregation of colloidal QDs but also provides good processability including solubility in solvents and compatibility with polymers. Typically, the colloidal QDs can be synthesized with commercially available ligands such as carboxylic acids, amines, phosphines, phosphine oxides, alkyl thiols, and so on. As a representative example, Fig. 1(c) shows that the light absorption and photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the colloidal CdSe QDs can be tuned by their size.

3.2 Types of quantum dots
As the size of the QDs decrease, the ratio of the surface area to the entire volume is increased. A large surface causes exceptional bond strain between surface atoms, which results in electron lone pairs or vacancies. They serve as surface traps by capturing excitons, which is the main process in non-radiative recombination. This is the reason bare QDs are typically the cause for poor quantum yield (QY). As a solution, a wide range of core–shell QDs has been developed. The core–inorganic shell structures can be classified into three categories type-I, type-II, and reverse type-I according to their band offsets, i.e., their comparable energy levels of the valence and conduction bands.40
In a type-I structure41–43 (including CdSe/ZnS), the shell material has a wider bandgap than the core. As a result, the electrons and holes are confined in the core material. Generally, the role of the inorganic shell is to passivate the surface of the core to improve the optical properties and enhance the stability against photo-bleaching. A sufficient shell reduces the number of dangling bonds that serve as trap sites for charge carriers. Shell growth results in a small red shift of the exciton peak in the absorption and PL spectra. However, increasing shell thickness reduces the surface activity of the core, leading to reduced quantum yield as well. This situation is attributed to a partial leakage of the exciton into the shell material.
In a type-II structure,44,45 both the valence and conduction bands of the core are either lower or higher than the band edges of the shell. As a result, one charge carrier moves to the core while the other moves to the shell. Owing to the spatial separation of the electron and the hole, type-II structures have longer PL decay times than type-I QDs. Therefore, Type-II QDs, such as CdSe/ZnTe and CdTe/CdSe structures have been specially developed for near-infrared emission.
In a reverse type-I structure,46–48 the shell has a smaller bandgap than the core. Both the electron and hole charges are partially delocalized in the shell and the PL wavelength can be tuned by the shell thickness in materials such as CdS/CdSe, ZnSe/InP, and CdS/HgS.
Alloyed quantum dots can be classified as homogeneous or gradient alloy structures depending on variations in surface or internal compositions of the QDs.
4 Down-conversion devices
4.1 Down-conversion devices with cadmium-based QDs
The down-conversion device LEDs utilize QDs as phosphors that convert part of the high energy photons originating from substrate LEDs to a lower energy.
The first report on optical down-conversion with CdSe/ZnS QDs used blue gallium nitrate (GaN) source to excite QDs in polylaurylmethacrylate (PLMA) polymer (Fig. 2(a)).49 Based on the concept, green and red emitted QDs and thermally stable polymeric resin are deposited on top of blue-emitting GaN to produce high purified white light that has three discrete colors. In general, white-LEDs (WLEDs) use an InGaN blue chip with yellow-emitting Ce3+-doped Y3Al5O12 (YAG:Ce) phosphors. Although the WLEDs with high luminous efficiency and good stability have been industrialized, it is difficult to obtain a high color rendering index (CRI or Ra) value due to insufficiency of the green and red emission.

(b) Schematic diagram of QD LED and blue, green, red QDs with silicone resin cured. (c) Display image of LCD TV with white QD-LED backlights. (Reprinted with permission from ref. 13. Copyright 2010, WILEY-VCH.) 
Chen et al. reported fabrication of WLEDs devices using blue InGaN chip with the green and red emitting CdSe/ZnSe QDs. As a result, the WLEDs showed a white light with a CIE (Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage) color coordinate of (0.33, 0.33) and Ra of 91.50 Jang et al. developed a green-yellow emitting Li+ and Pr3+ co-doped Sr3SiO5:Ce3+phosphor for blue InGaN LEDs in WLEDs device. Their devices exhibited CIE color coordinates of (0.29, 0.29), a correlative color temperature (CCT) of 8864 K, and Ra value of 90.1.51 The result showed that inorganic phosphors and QDs in LED devices could be obtained from a white light source with a high color-rendering value. Jang et al. used CdSe/ZnS/CdSZnS QDs for green color converter and CdSe/CdS/ZnS/CdSZnS QDs for red color converter in blue LEDs (Fig. 2(b)) to demonstrate WLEDs for display backlights. As a result, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) reached 72% for green-light emission and 34% for red-light emission. Additionally, a luminous efficacy (also called luminescence power efficiency) of 41 lm W−1 and a lifetime above 2200 h under ambient conditions was obtained. More importantly, their QD-WLED backlights were successfully applied to 46-in LCD TV panels (Fig. 2(c)).13
Recently, Wang et al. reported Cu-doped CdS/ZnS QDs applied to WLEDs using YAG:Ce phosphors to enhance the CRI value without the re-absorption problems of multiphase phosphors. The as-fabricated WLEDs showed high luminous efficacy, good device stability, and Ra value of 86–90.52
4.2 Down-conversion devices with cadmium free based QDs
As an alternative to toxic cadmium-based QDs, Ziegler et al. reported a blue LED chip using red InP/ZnS/SiO2 phosphor, green Sr0.94Al2O4:Eu0.06 phosphor, and yellow YAG:Ce phosphor, which exhibited a luminous efficacy of 15 lm W−1 and Ra value of 86 at 3900 K (Fig. 3).53 In 2012, Kim et al. reported a successive large scale synthesis of high-quality InP/ZnS QDs with a hybrid flow reactor and their QD-WLEDs application for improving color rendering performance. They incorporated bluish green, yellow and red InP/ZnS QDs into the device and obtained a CRI of 89.55 They are satisfactory in the toxicity, however, InP/ZnS QDs showed poor photoluminescence and low thermal stability. In addition, aggregation phenomena occurred during device fabrication. In order to overcome this problem, our group developed highly stable and luminescent InP/GaP/ZnS core–shell–shell structures and applied them to QD-WLED devices.54 We demonstrated down-conversion WLEDs based on red-emitting InP/GaP/ZnS QDs combined with yellow-emitting YAG:Ce with silicon resin on InGaN blue LED chips (Fig. 4(a)). Using various InP/GaP/ZnS mixing conditions, the QD-WLEDs showed the best luminous efficacy of 54.71 lm W−1, Ra of 80.56, and CCT of 7864 K at CIE color coordinates of (0.30, 0.28) (Fig. 4(b)).54 Similarly, Kim et al. developed InP-based multi-shell QDs such as InP/ZnS/ZnSe and applied them to QD-WLEDs. As a result, an Ra value of 84.3 was obtained.56

Another approach without InP based QDs has also been conducted. Song et al. reported bright WLEDs using cadmium-free ternary QDs such as a CuInS2/ZnS core–shell structure. QD-WLEDs characterization showed the CIE color coordinates of (0.33–0.34, 0.27–0.29), CRI of 72–75, CCT of 4447–5380 K, and high luminous efficacy of 63.4 lm W−1.57 Kim et al. fabricated a silica composite with CuInS2/ZnS core–shell QDs and applied it to WLEDs, presenting white light with good color stability under various operating currents.58 Song et al. also reported Cu–In0.3–Ga0.7–S/ZnS alloy core–shell QDs and their attempt as color converters for blue emitting LEDs. The device exhibited high luminous efficacy of 69.1–75.0 lm W−1 at 20 mA. In order to obtain better CRI, they prepared the device by blending two QDs of Cu–In0.3–Ga0.7–S/ZnS and Cu–In–S/ZnS.59 Chung et al. developed highly luminescent Zn doped CuInS2 (ZCIS) nanocrystals. The incorporation of Zn resulted in tuned emission from 536 nm to 637 nm and a high quantum yield up to 45%. They also exhibited a high color rendering of 84.1 with a warm color temperature of 4256 K. They used dual ZCIS QDs of 567 nm and 617 nm emitting as a color converter and InGaN as a blue LED. CIE color coordinates were shifted from (0.36, 0.33) at 20 mA to (0.34, 0.32) at 50 mA.60
These results suggested that the combination of both QDs and inorganic phosphors can effectively demonstrate white light with high Ra value.
5 Electroluminescence (EL) devices
5.1 EL devices with cadmium-based QDs on organic charge transport layer
The hybrid quantum dot/polymer LED was first devised in 1994 by Colvin et al.15 They reported highly luminescent emission from the radiative recombination of holes injected into a layer of poly(p-phenylenevinylene) (PPV), with electrons injected into a bilayer of CdSe QDs. The structure consisted of an ITO as the anode, a PPV hole-transporting layer (HTL), CdSe QDs as the luminescent material, and the Mg/Ag electrode as the cathode. The resulting device showed voltage-dependent colors, a luminosity of ∼100 cd m−2, and an EQE of 0.001–0.01%. However, the performance of the device could not be optimized (Fig. 5(c)).15 Subsequently, the same group reported bilayer devices based on CdSe/CdS core–shell quantum dots.61 The light emitted from the devices could be tuned from green to red. They showed an improved EQE of 0.22% and a luminosity of 600 cd m−2 with an operating voltage of 4 V.

(Reprinted with permission from ref. 65. Copyright 2007, American Chemical Society.) 
In 2002, Coe et al. developed a phase-separation technique that enabled formation of a close-packed QD monolayer on the hole-transporting material N,N′-diphenyl-N,N′-bis(3-methylphenyl)-N,N′-bis(phenyl)benzidine (TPD) using a single-step spin-cast process.62 Their device was fabricated with a thin blocking layer by thermal evaporation of 3-(4-biphenyl)-4-phenyl-5-tert-butylphenyl-1,2,4-triazole (TAZ), followed by deposition of a 40 nm tris-(8-hydroxyquinoline)aluminum (Alq3) overlayer and a Mg/Ag electrode. The role of TAZ was to block the holes and confine the excitons in the emitting layer, which leads to a narrower emission with lower contributions from TPD and Alq3 than the device without the TAZ hole blocking layer (Fig. 5(a) and (b)).62 In short, The role of TAZ suppresses Alq3 emission by blocking transport of both holes and excitons into the Alq3. As a result, the device with TAZ exhibited a low turn-on voltage and EQE of 0.52% at 10 mA cm−2. Zhao et al. developed a hybrid quantum dot/polymer multilayered LED based on a monolayer of CdSe/CdS quantum dots deposited by spin-coating on top of thermally polymerized solvent-resistant HTLs. Multiple spin-on HTLs improve the EQE of the LEDs to ∼0.8% at a luminosity of 100 cd m−2.63
Sun et al. reported color-saturated red-, orange-, yellow-, and green-emitting QD-LEDs. In order to improve the stability of the device, the QD monolayer was replaced with multilayers. The optimal thickness of the QD emission layers varied with the size and shell structure of the QDs, which was attributed to different carrier injection barriers. As a result, the optimal configuration of the QD emission layers were determined to be 2 red, 2.5 orange, 4 yellow, and 7 green layers. The improved devices exhibited low turn-on voltage (3–4 V) and a luminescence current efficiency of 1.1–2.8 cd A−1.64
On the other hand, LED fabrication using monolayers of QDs between the organic electron-transporting layers (ETLs) and HTLs was also attempted. Anikeeva et al. demonstrated production of WLEDs with broad emission spectra that were generated by electroluminescence from monolayers of red- (CdSe/ZnS), green- (ZnSe/CdSe/ZnS), and blue- (CdZnS alloy) emitting QDs in a hybrid organic–inorganic structure (Fig. 5(d)).65 The QD monolayers and charge-transporting layers could be independently processed to allow precise tuning of emission by controlling the number of quantum dots in monolayers. As a result, white QD-LEDs showed EQE of 0.36% and CIE coordinates of (0.35, 0.41).
Bae et al. created an ITO/PEDOT:PSS/QD multilayer/TPBi/LiF/Al device structure with color-saturated green QDs for highly stable Cd1−xZnxS/ZnS gradient-alloyed QDs. As a result, the green-emitting QD-LEDs showed a luminescence current efficiency of 5.2 cd A−1, a EQE of 1.4% EQE, and a brightness of 1500 cd m−2 at 7.7 V.66
Kwak et al. tested the CdSe/ZnS QD/poly(p-methyltriphenylamine-b-cysteamine acrylamide) (PTPA-b-CAA) hybrid films as active emission layers in QD-LEDs, which exhibited a turn on-voltage of 4 V and 2.2% of EQE in the range of practical luminosity. (100–1000 cd m−2).67
In 2009, Anikeeva et al. prepared various color-emitting QD-LEDs that incorporated a QD monolayer on the same substrate with further improved device performance. With a device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/spiroTPD/QD monolayer/TPBi/Mg:Ag/Ag, the EQE values were 1% for red, 2.7% for orange, 2.6% for green, 0.2% for cyan, and 0.4% for blue LEDs.68
5.2 EL devices with cadmium free-based QDs on organic charge transport layer
More recently, Lim et al. developed InP/ZnSeS QDs with a gradient shell utilizing the reactivity difference between TOP-S and TOP-Se precursors. They succeeded in EL emission from ITO/PEDOT:PSS/spiro TPD/QD monolayer/TPBi/LiF/Al device structures with color-saturated green emitting InP/ZnSeS QDs. As a result, the green-emitting QD-LEDs showed maximum EQE of ∼0.008%.69
Yang et al. reported high quality InP/ZnS QDs by a facile one-pot solvothermal synthesis. Their device consists of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/poly-TPD/QDs/TPBi/LiF/Al multilayers. Their white light resulted from the red emitting InP/ZnS, which is complementary to the blue and green-emitting poly-TPD. The CIE coordinate was (0.332, 0.338) with a high Ra value of 91 and a luminosity of 270 cd m−2 (Fig. 6(a) and (b)).70

These results show the possibilities of InP-based QDs in the EL applications.
5.3 EL devices with cadmium-based QDs based on inorganic charge transport layer
Production of QD-LEDs using organic charge transport layers experience problems such as high cost and difficulty of device fabrication. One of the advantages of inorganic QDs is that they are more stable than organic dye. It is therefore reasonable to investigate whether replacing the organic charge-transporting layers with inorganic charge-transporting layers would enable air-stable devices.
Mueller et al. first reported studies on air-stable colloidal QD-LEDs with inorganic charge-transporting layers utilizing p- and n-doped GaN injection layers deposited by energy-neutral atomic beam lithography/epitaxy (ENABLE). Although the EQEs of their devices ranged only from 0.001 to 0.01%, their attempt was meaningful because the QDs could be incorporated in all inorganic charge-transporting materials.71
Caruge et al. constructed air-stable QD-LEDs using amorphous, radio-frequency- (RF-) sputtered metal oxides as charge-transporting layers at room temperature. The QD-LEDs exhibited a brightness of 1950 cd m−2 and EQEs of 0.1%. The device structure employed an ITO anode, a p-type NiO layer as the HTL, a ZnCdSe alloy as the QD layer, an n-type ZnO:SnO2 as the ETL, and a Ag cathode (Fig. 7(a) and (b)).31 Radio-frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering was selected as the deposition technique for the metal-oxide transport layers. Although the all-inorganic devices exhibited color-saturated QD EL peaks (Fig. 7(c)) and stable operation at high operation voltage (Fig. 7(d)), the overall performance of the LEDs including efficiency (EQE of 0.09%) and turn-on voltage (3.8 V) were not better than those of organic QD-LEDs.31

The low performance of all-inorganic devices result from exciton quenching of QDs in contact with the metal-oxide layer owing to the relatively high carrier concentration (∼1014 cm−3) and the Auger non-radiative recombination by QD charging.72 Therefore, inorganic QD-LEDs operate solely via direct charge injection and require device control with adequate band alignment.
Two approaches to improve the efficiency of inorganic QD-LEDs are under investigation. One is to generate Förster energy-transfer excitation of QDs within an inorganic structure. Achermann et al. reported a hybrid structure comprising CdSe QDs assembled of InGaN/GaN quantum wells close to the CdSe QD layer to enable both energy transfer and carrier injection in an all inorganic structure. This device provided a color conversion efficiency of 13%.73
Cho et al. fabricated cross-linked structures of the QD layers with a sol–gel-type spin-cast TiO2 layer as the ETL.12 The device consisted of an ITO anode, a PEDOT:PSS hole-injecting layer (HIL), poly[(9,9-dioctylfluorenyl-2,7-diyl)-co-(4,4′-(N′-(4-sec-butylphenyl)) diphenylamine)] (TFB) as the HTL, CdSe/CdS/ZnS QD emitting layers, a TiO2 ETL, and a Al cathode (Fig. 8(a)). The device was designed to achieve efficient electron and hole injection from the electrodes to the QDs. Owing to the low energy band offset of aluminum (0.4 eV) and high electron mobility of the sol–gel type TiO2 film, the device showed an electron-dominant characteristic and enhanced electron injection. Besides, it reduced the turn-on voltage below the QD bandgap. The research group also decreased the hole-injection barrier from the HTL to the QDs by crosslinking them with primary amine. After thermal annealing of the cross-linked QD multilayers, the hole-injection barrier was decreased to 0.6 eV and the contact between the QDs and the HTL was improved. The device resulted in a luminosity of 12380 cd m−2, a luminescence current efficiency of 1.67 cd A−1, a low turn-on voltage of 1.9 V, and a high luminous efficacy of 2.41 lm W−1 (Fig. 8(b)).

The cross-linked QD-LEDs were used in a 4-in display that had uniform brightness with less than 5% variation using an amorphous silicon thin-film transistor backbone as an active-matrix drive (Fig. 8(c)).12 Although they were colloidal QD-LEDs of high-performance and commercialized large-area devices, they required the annealing process to hydrolyze the TiO2 precursors and the poor electron mobility caused by amorphous TiO2 had to be improved.
To solve the problems, Qian et al. built multi-structures using poly-TPD as the organic HTL, CdSe/ZnS QDs as the emission layer, and ZnO as the inorganic ETL.74 They fabricated bright, efficient QD-LEDs that showed higher electron mobility using a solution-processable crystalline ZnO nanoparticle layer as the ETL in combination with a thermally polymerized poly-TPD as HTL. As a result, the device had a maximum luminosity of 4200 cd m−2 and luminous efficacy of 0.17 lm W−1 for blue-light emission; 68000 cd m−2 and 8.2 lm W−1 for green-light emission; 31000 cd m−2 and 3.8 lm W−1 for orange-red-light emission, respectively (Fig. 9(a) and (b)). Moreover, this device showed high environmental stability and an operation life time exceeding 250 h in low vacuum with an initial luminosity of 600 cd m−2.

Another approach to improve the efficiency of inorganic QD-LEDs is to research new mechanisms of QD excitation. For example, Wood et al. developed an n-i-n unipolar QD-LED structure whose operation was based on electrical excitation by field-induced ionization of QDs. The device consisted of ITO/ZTO (ZnO and SnO2)/QD layers/ZTO/ZnS/ZTO/ITO multilayers (Fig. 9(c)). As a result, the device demonstrated an EQE of 0.15% and a maximum luminosity of 1.40 cd m−2. It was the first reported DC-field-driven QD-LED. The system was able to remove charges from the QD film and emit light constantly from the QD-LED devices for over 20 h in air and in the unpackaged state.75
Recently, Kwak and Bae reported development of an inverted QD-LED structure by using solution-processed ZnO nanoparticles as the electron-injecting/transporting layer and by optimizing energy levels with an organic HTL. The inverted device structure has many advantages: (1) through the suitable choice of HTMs with low highest-occupied molecular orbitals, the hole injection into QDs can improve EQE. (2) A diverse range of HTMs with good stability can be easily deposited on top of the QD layer. As a result, the group's bright red, green, and blue (RGB) QD-LEDs demonstrated EQEs of 7.3, 5.8, and 1.7% and maximum luminosities of up to 23040, 218800, and 2250 cd m−2, respectively. Moreover, the structure showed saturated RGB colors in the emitting area of 1.2 × 1.2 cm2at an applied voltage of 2.6–3.3 V and lifetime expended to hundreds of hours.76 As we have known, EL devices with inorganic charge transport layer using cadmium free based QDs have not yet been reported.
In this section, we summarized the various QD based EL devices by organic or inorganic charge transfer layer. As mentioned above, performance of QD based EL devices has been improved in the past few years. However, there are so many issues surrounding QD-based EL devices such as large hole-injection barrier, low suitability between the HTL and QDs.
In short, new organic or inorganic HTMs and surface modification method are required to overcome the current device limitation.
6 Printing process
6.1 Micro-contacting printing QD-LEDs
Micro-contact printing appears to be an attractive technique to replace current methods used for wet deposition of QDs. In standard micro-contact printing, a poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) stamp is used to transfer ink on a solid substrate. However, it cannot be used to deposit colloidal quantum dots because non-polar solvents such as hexane and toluene cause swelling of the PDMS stamp. In order to prevent PDMS swelling, Kim et al. modified the PDMS surface with chemical vapor deposition of parylene-C, as summarized in Fig. 10(c).77 Since the aromatic parylene-C is compatible with chloroform from the QD solution and is sub-optimal for minimizing the surface energy, it was successfully transferred to a substrate (Fig. 10(a) and (b)). As a result, they could form patterns of close-packed multicolor QD-LEDs with 25 μm pixels. Therefore, the printed QD-LEDs showed high EQEs of 1.0%, 0.5%, and 0.2% for red, green, and blue QD-LEDs, respectively.77

Rizzo et al. also reported a simple and inexpensive dry deposition technique for QD-LEDs through a micro-contact printing, double-transfer process. As a result, the maximum luminosity of their device was 90 cd m−2 at 20 mA m−2 and the EQE was 0.15%.78 They also developed a micro-contact method using an SU-8 photoresist instead of parylene-C.79
Recently, Samsung Electronics reported a full-color quantum dot display that was fabricated using the transfer-printing method. Excellent morphology, well-ordered QD structure, and clearly defined interfaces of solvent-free transfer-printed QD films contributed to improvements in electroluminescence performance (Fig. 11(a)).14 To realize perfect transfer of the QD pattern, the surface of the donor substrate was modified with octadecyltrichlorosilane (ODTS), which resulted in weak interactions between the donor substrate and the QD surface by reducing the surface energy. Fabrication of the transfer-printed RGB QD stripes onto the substrate was achieved with high reproducibility (Fig. 11(b)). Consequently, the printed red QD-LED showed a maximum power efficiency of 71%, a luminous efficacy of 4.25 lm W−1, and a luminescence efficiency of ∼25–52%. Based on these printing techniques, they developed a 4-in full-color active-matrix QD display.14

6.2 Inkjet printing QD-LEDs
Inkjet printing is a deposition technique without using liquid-phase masks such as nanoparticles and conducting polymer solutions. The printing process essentially involves a piezoelectric nozzle, which ejects small picoliter ink droplets upon receipt of an electric signal. The liquid drop ejected from the nozzle spreads on the substrate; the printing height depends on polymer concentration and flow properties that are characterized by the contact angle, viscosity, and surface tension.80 The design of micro-patterns can be easily achieved by controlling the trajectory of the inkjet nozzle using a computer. Owing to these advantages, they have received considerable attention as an alternative printing technique for organic electronics. The inkjet was utilized to print monochromatic red, green, and blue QDs in devices consisting of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/Poly TPD/CdSe/ZnS QD/TPBI/LIF/Al. A low operation bias at 5.2 V and a video luminosity of 100 cd m−2 at 9.3 V was reported.81
Bulovic et al. reported full-color emission from an inkjet-printed crystalline PET/ITO QD-PIB phosphor layer (Fig. 12). The luminous efficacy was approximately 0.1 lm W−1 for blue phosphor, which was driven with 120 V at 31 kHz.82

7 Conclusions
In this article, we have highlighted the performance of QD-LEDs in term of the different approaches to down-conversion, EL, micro-contact, and inkjet printing using cadmium based and cadmium free QDs. The performance of QD-LEDs has improved rapidly in the last few decades and the need for lower cost and higher efficiency with increased functionality will continue to drive innovation. Recent developments in the performance of cadmium-based QD-LEDs have exceeded previous standards. However, cadmium is an extremely toxic element and its potential release is considerably dangerous to the environment and humankind. Eventually, the toxicity of cadmium-based QDs will limit their industrial application. The development of cadmium-free QD-LEDs still face challenges such as color purity, stability of QDs, and compatibility of QDs and polymers. To obtain good device performance, the carrier-transporting layers should keep the densities of holes and electrons in the QD layers in balance. However, the large hole-injection barrier between the HTL and QDs and the Auger non-radiative recombination of QDs remain as obstacles for direct injection of carriers. Therefore, new organic or inorganic HTMs and cadmium-free QDs that are more stable and more compatible are necessary.
