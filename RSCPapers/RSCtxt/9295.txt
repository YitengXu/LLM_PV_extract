LSC panels that absorb multiple wavelength bands are required to achieve high power conversion efficiency (PCE). In this study, we demonstrate a pair of downshift LSC and photon upconversion (UC) LSC, absorbing triple bands (violet, green, and red light). The UC is obtained by energy transfer and triplet–triplet annihilation between sensitizer and emitter dyes. In particular, we exploit the dual sensitizer to obtain absorption of the dual wavelength band. The couple with the UC LSC obtains photoluminescence of a single visible wavelength band from the LSC, which enables the use of wide bandgap solar cells to absorb it. Here, we apply mixed-cation perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with high absorption coefficients, especially at visible wavelengths. In our triple-band-absorbing LSC-PSC, we achieve a maximum PCE of 8.99%.
Introduction
Luminescent solar concentrator-photovoltaic systems (LSC-PV) have unique applications that require high transparency, such as in building-integrated photovoltaic systems (BIPV) and vehicle-integrated photovoltaic systems (VIPV).1–3 A typical LSC-PV consists of a transparent plate containing highly emissive fluorophores4 and a solar cell attached to its edge.5,6 The fluorophores in the LSC panel gather sunlight at a specific wavelength and subsequently emit photoluminescence (PL) light. This PL light is trapped by total internal reflection in a thin plate, guided to the edges of the plate, and harvested by solar cells. LSC-PV have advantages over conventional stand-alone solar cells. LSC-PV are haze-free and transparent because the LSC is a transparent panel in which fluorescent molecules or nanoparticles are dispersed.7 LSC-PV is relatively inexpensive because it applies expensive solar cells only to the area of the edge surface of the panel.8,9 For large area devices, LSC-PV do not require additional grid electrodes for the module as in solar cells.8,9
However, because the fluorescence dyes in LSCs usually absorb only a narrow wavelength band in the solar spectrum, LSC-PV show lower power conversion efficiency (PCE) compared to stand-alone solar cells with the same light harvesting area. Therefore, many efforts have been made to extend the absorption wavelength range of LSCs and thereby improve the PCE.4,10 Wu et al. prepared double-panel LSCs containing CuInSeS and Mn-doped CdZnS quantum dots (QDs) for absorbing both visible and ultraviolet (UV) light. They reported a 3.1% power conversion efficiency, which is 52% more efficient than single-panel LSCs.11 Ma et al. applied LSCs absorbing 300–450 nm and 400–570 nm using carbon dots and aggregation-induced emission molecules, respectively.12
Although these attempts directly improved the PCE of the LSC-PV, it should be noted that the introduction of multiband-absorbing LSCs extends the range of PL emission wavelengths towards the infrared region, requiring a narrow bandgap solar cell or a series of solar cells that can absorb them.13 In general, narrow bandgap solar cells (e.g., GaAs, CZTS, multi-junction solar cells) are expensive, and therefore their use greatly diminishes the low cost advantages of LSC-PV.14 For practical LSC-PV, the LSC should have both a wide absorption wavelength range and also emit light of a relatively short wavelength.
The introduction of LSCs with photon upconversion (UC) is one way to tackle this issue.15 UC is the anti-Stokes process of converting two low-energy photons into one high-energy photon. A UC LSC absorbs long wavelength light and emits short wavelength light.16,17 The UC has been obtained from lanthanide-doped materials, such as Yb3+-doped NaYF4,18 or bimolecular organic dye pairs of sensitizers and annihilators (or emitters).19 In a multiband-absorbing LSC including UC LSC, PL emission can be obtained in a narrow wavelength range. However, previous applications of UC have been limited to luminescent back reflectors to improve solar cell efficiency.20,21
Here, we demonstrate a triple-band-absorbing LSC-PV, including a UC LSC. The LSC consists of a dual panel, where the front panel (i.e., absorbs sunlight first) is the downshift (DS) LSC that absorbs violet light, and the rear panel is the UC LSC that simultaneously absorbs green and red light (see Fig. 1a). In particular, we achieve a dual-band absorbing UC LSC by exploiting dual sensitizers. All LSC panels emit the same blue light, allowing for the use of low-cost, commercially available wide-bandgap solar cells as PV devices. In this study, we apply a perovskite solar cell (PSC). The PSC can be fabricated by low cost, room temperature solution processes.22–24 Compared to conventional semiconductor solar cells, PSCs have limited absorption wavelengths up to about 800 nm, but a remarkably high absorption coefficient at the wavelength of blue light; the extinction coefficient of methylammonium lead halides perovskite at around 500 nm is ∼105 cm−1, which is much greater than the coefficient value of c-Si or GaAs, ∼104 cm−1.22–24 By a couple of triple-band-absorbing LSC panels and PSCs, we obtain a maximum PCE value of 8.99%.

Experimental procedures
Preparation of LSCs
For DS LSC panel, 2 mM perylene (Sigma-Aldrich) in chloroform was prepared. The liquid polyurethane prepolymer (PU, Clear Flex 50) and the perylene solution were mixed and chloroform was removed from the mixture using a rotary evaporator. The resulting viscous polyurethane solution containing perylene was cast on glass substrates with a 5.0 cm × 1.0 cm. After 15 min, another glass substrate was covered on the casted solution to make the uniform layer, followed by curing overnight at room temperature in a dark place with a relative humidity below 20%. For UC LSC panel, a mixture of 0.03–0.12 mM meso-tetraphenyl-tetrabenzoporphine palladium complex (PdTPBP, Chemodex), 0.03–0.25 mM palladium octaethylporphyrin (PdOEP, Frontier Science), and of 0.12 mM perylene in chloroform were used. The dual-panel LSC was fabricated by removing the glass cover of each LSC panel and then attaching these faces.
Assembly of LSC-PSCs
Preparation of PSCs has been reported in elsewhere.25 Briefly, we form a 300 nm thick mesoporous TiO2 on a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate, a perovskite film on it, and a hole transport layer (HTL) of Spiro-OMeTAD. The mesoporous TiO2 was obtained by dipping the FTO substrate in a TiCl4 aqueous solution, reacting at 70 °C for about 1 hour, and performing heat treatment at 500 °C. The perovskite precursor solution was then prepared by dissolving MAI and PbI2 (1:1, 1.4 M) in 1 mL mixed solvent of DMF and DMSO (volume ratio 4:1). The hole transport material solution was prepared by dissolving 90 mg of Spiro-OMeTAD in 1 mL CB. For doping, 45 μL of a LiTFSI/acetonitrile solution (170 mg ml−1) and 10 μl of tBP and 75 μL of Co(III) complex FK102/acetonitrile (75 mM) were added to the Spiro-OMeTAD/CB (90 mg ml−1) solution. The fabrication of all procedures was carried out in a controlled environment with a relative humidity of less than 20%. The Au counter electrode was deposited by thermal evaporation with a 100 nm thickness using a metal shadow mask. The active electrode area was 0.1 cm2. We attached the PSC to one side of the edge of the LSC with a dimension of 5.0 cm × 1.0 cm × 0.1 cm using an adhesive (Norland Optical NOA 63). The other three edge faces were painted black.
Characterization
The absorbance and reflectance were measured by UV-vis spectroscopy (SHIMADZU, UV-2550) equipped with an integrating sphere. A spectrofluorophotometer (SHIMADZU, RF-6000) was used to measure the PL. In PL measurements on LSC panels, excitation light was incident perpendicular to the panel and the emission intensity was measured in a direction parallel to the film surface. The J–V curves of the LSC-coupled PSCs were measured using a source meter (Keithley Instruments) under simulated sunlight illumination using a 150 W Xe lamp (300 W, Oriel) with a AM 1.5 G filter. The light intensity was adjusted using a Si reference cell (BS-520, Bunko-Keiki) to obtain a power density of 100 mW cm−2. Photocurrent measurements at specific wavelength bands were made by passing 1 sun AM 1.5 G solar light through a combination of longpass and shortpass optical filters (Thorlabs Inc.). For example, the illumination of the 500–600 nm wavelength band was obtained with a combination of a longpass filter with a cut-on wavelength of 500 nm and a shortpass filter with a cut-off wavelength of 600 nm.
Results and discussion
The sequence of light absorption, luminescence, and total internal reflection in the triple band absorbing LSC, and absorption in the PSC is depicted in Fig. 1a.
The DS LSC is prepared by dispersing perylene in a PU matrix, and the UC LSC is obtained by dispersing PdOEP/PdTPBP as a sensitizer and perylene as a emitter in PU. We chose PU because it exhibits excellent shielding properties against oxygen molecules which quench the excited state of organic dyes,26 and facilitates the diffusion of dye molecules with its low Tg (∼210 K).27,28 The PSC is coupled to the edge of the LSC.
The incident light first reaches the DS LSC, where perylene absorbs a wavelength in the 350–450 nm range (i.e., violet light) and emits a wavelength in the 450–550 nm range (i.e., blue light); the absorption and PL spectra are displayed in Fig. 1b and c, respectively. The light (>450 nm) that transmits the DS LSC is incident on the UC LSC. The PdOEP and PdTPBP in the UC LSC show Soret-band absorption around 400 nm wavelength. In addition, PdOEP exhibits Q-band absorption at 500–600 nm and PdTPBP at 550–650 nm.29 (Fig. S1†). In Fig. 1b, the Soret-band absorption is not observed because there is complete absorption of this wavelength band in the DS LSC. In the PL spectrum of Fig. 1c, the emission of the up-converted light at 450–550 nm wavelength (i.e., blue light) by the Q-band absorption (i.e., red light) of each of the two sensitizers is identified.
One of the UC mechanisms by the dual sensitizers is depicted in Fig. 1d. As shown later, UC can also be obtained by PdOEPs or PdTPBPs, respectively, but shows higher PL intensity in the sample to which they are mixed; this implies that the UC process by dual sensitizing may be dominant. Briefly, the UC process start with the light absorption in PdOEP and PdTPBP, which results in excited singlet states in each. Immediate intersystem crossing (ISC) then leads triplet excited states.16,17 The presence of nearby perylene achieves triplet–triplet energy transfer (TTET) to its triplet state. Triplet–triplet annihilation (TTA) between two triplet excited perylene allows one to form a singlet excited state with higher energy than the incident light.16,17 The decay of this excited state to the ground state is accompanied by the emission of the up-converted light.
The fluorophore concentration in each LSC is controlled to maximize the PL emission from the DS/UC LSCs. Fig. 2a shows the mapping of the PL intensity of UC LSC to changes in the range of 0.03–0.12 mM for PdOEP and 0.03–0.12 mM for PdTPBP. The maximum PL intensity is obtained under the conditions of 0.06 mM PdOEP and 0.03 mM PdTPBP; another local maximum is obtained at 0.03 mM PdOEP and 0.06 mM PdTPBP. We observe that higher intensity is observed for the mixture of PdOEP and PdTPBP compared to PdOEP or PdTPBP alone. The PL intensity with 0.06 mM PdOEP/0.03 mM PdTPBP or 0.03 mM PdOEP/0.06 mM PdTPBP is about 10–15% higher than that at 0.09 mM PdOEP or 0.09 mM PdTPBP alone. The achievement of higher PL intensity at high concentration ratios of PdOEP is due to the higher quantum yield (QY) value of PdOEP-based UC compared to that of PdTPBP UC (see the supplementary note #1). Compared to PdTPBP, PdOEP allows for a wider overlap of its triplet energy band with the energy band of the emitter perylene, resulting in higher rates of TTET.29

We observe a decreased PL intensity at concentrations greater than the maximum, e.g., 0.06 mM PdOEP and 0.06 mM PdTPBP. In this condition, the absorption in the sensitizer may be increased, but a decrease in the TTET rate or/and energy back transfer rate may be caused by relatively high concentrations of sensitizers.30
In Fig. 2b, we determine the optimal thickness of the UC LSC plate. We attach PSCs to LSC plates prepared at various thicknesses and compare the photocurrent from the solar cells under 1 sun illumination. The maximum value of the photocurrent is obtained at 1 mm thickness, with a slight decrease and saturation in thicker plates. This saturation may be responsible for the much higher rate of reabsorption of PL at thicker film; the emission wavelength of the DS/UC LSC partially overlaps the absorption band in the range of 440–460 nm for perylene (Fig. S1†). In Fig. 2c, the threshold light intensity of the TTA-based UC is approximately 100 mW cm−2 (equivalent to irradiation at 1 sun, AM 1.5 G illumination). The threshold intensity is determined at the inflection point where the slope changes linearly from quadratic to the graph of light irradiation intensity vs. PL response.31,32
The optimization of fluorophore concentration and plate thickness in the DS LSC plate is shown in Fig. S2.† The maximum PL intensity is obtained at 2.0 mM perylene but the intensity decreases as the concentration further increases. It shows the optimum thickness of the DS LSC plate is 1 mm; with a thicker film, the photocurrent output was nearly saturated.
We evaluate the photovoltaic performance of triple-band-absorbing DS/UC LSC-PSC. The area of the LSC plate was 5 cm × 1 cm, with the PSC cell (the active area: 1 cm × 1 mm) attached only to one side of the edge, as shown in Fig. 3a. The efficiency of the PSC cell itself was about 16.5% on average (see Fig. S3†). The simulated solar light at 1 sun intensity was incident perpendicular to the LSC panel. The J–V curves and various photovoltaic parameters, including photocurrent density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), and fill factor (FF), are shown in Fig. 3b and Table 1, respectively. The PCE was calculated by Jsc × Voc × FF/(100 [mW cm−2]). According to common practice, we calculated the values of Jsc and PCE based on the area of the LSC plate. We also present the efficiency of the LSC-PV defined by the output power versus the incident power multiplied by the G factor (see supplementary note #3).22

We see a negligible PCE of 0.86% on a blank LSC panel that does not contain fluorophores (Fig. S4†). The exposure of illumination directly to the solar cell or the transmission of light through the substrate is negligible. In Table 1, UC LSCs with 0.06 mM PdOEP or 0.06 mM PdTPBP alone exhibits efficiencies of 7.92% and 7.51%, respectively; the concentration of perylene in each of these LSCs was 0.12 mM. The addition of 0.03 mM PdTPBP or 0.03 mM PdOEP at each LSC improves the PCE by 13.5% and 17% respectively; these increases correspond to the increase in PL intensity with the addition of another sensitizer, as seen in Fig. 2a.
We obtained the maximum PCE of 8.99% under the condition of 0.06 mM PdOEP and 0.03 mM PdTPBP. This value is about 9% higher than the PCE obtained in 0.03 mM PdOEP and 0.06 mM PdTPBP. These conditions correspond to the concentration conditions of maximum PL intensity and those of local maximum in the PL mapping in Fig. 2a, respectively. The condition of 0.06 mM PdOEP and 0.06 mM PdTPBP prepared by further addition of PdOEP or PdTPBP delivered a rather lower PCE.
The maximum PCE value (8.99%) of our LSC-PSC is superior to previous results with similar LSC panel area; Slooff et al. emphasized 4.6% of PCE with LSCs containing perylene/coumarine and GaAs solar cells,33 and Li et al. achieved 8.7% of PCE with LSCs containing CulnS2/ZnS and Si solar cells.34 This comparison shows the synergistic advantages of our multiband-absorbing LSCs and PSCs with high visible light conversion efficiency.
To determine the respective contributions of DS or UC to the photocurrent density, we observe the photocurrent outputs over different wavelength ranges were evaluated, as shown in Fig. 3c. Illumination in each wavelength range was achieved by passing a 1 sun solar light through an optical filter; the optical filter for <500 nm shows about 10–15% lower transmission at that wavelength than filters used in other wavelength bands; this indicates that the photocurrent density in that wavelength band is underestimated. In DS LSCs, the photocurrent is shown only at absorptions of 200–500 nm; this corresponds to absorption by perylene. The coupling of a PdOEP-containing UC LSC to the DS LSC produces the additional photocurrent at 500–550 nm wavelength; this shows the contribution of UC by PdOEP absorption. The coupling of PdTPBP-based UC LSCs produces the additional photocurrent at 600–700 nm wavelength, which shows the PdTPBP absorption. The coupling of dual sensitizer UC LSC shows the generation of photocurrent in both the wavelength bands of 500–550 nm and 600–700 nm.
To verify the validity of the photocurrent gain by the dual-sensitizing UC LSC, we calculate the ideal photocurrent value from the following equations. The equation below first calculates the PL irradiation (PLSC) from sensitizers under 1 sun illumination (eqn (1)), and then calculates the photocurrent in a solar cell with incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) when the PL emission is fully irradiated to the solar cell (eqn (2)). PLSC = ∫P(λ) × ηabs(λ) × QY(λ) × G factor × ηwgdλ(1) (2)
Here, ηabs represents the absorption efficiency of dye molecules, G factor is defined as the ratio of the panel area and the area of the edge face, and ηwg represents the waveguiding efficiency of the LSC panel.35 We considered the ηabs to be unity for solar light. The value of the G factor was determined to be 4.2 by using solar cells attached only to one side of the panel. The ηwg was reported to be approximately 75%.36,37 We applied the IPCE of the PSCs by 85% over 470–500 nm. (Fig. S8†).38 The photocurrent value for the dual-sensitizer UC is calculated to be 4.3 mA cm−2, which rationalizes the photocurrent gain (2.77 mA cm−2) obtained in the experiment.

Fig. 3d shows the UV-Vis absorption spectrum of the DS/UC LSC. The average visible transmittance (AVT) in the 400–800 nm range is approximately 78%. This value is much greater than the AVT range of 9–46% reported in stand-alone perovskite solar cells highlighting semi-transparency.39–41
We evaluate the photocurrent output of the LSC-PSC at various angles of incidence of solar light, as shown in Fig. 4a. Cosine loss represents the irradiation intensity of illumination at various angles of incidence. The photocurrent output, decreasing at a rate similar to cosine loss, shows that the oblique incidence produces a photocurrent proportional to the corresponding irradiation. This result implies that a constant PCE can be maintained even under outdoor environmental conditions. Fig. 4b shows the photocurrent output for long term operation with the efficiency reduction of only 18% for 300 hours.

Conclusions
A multiband absorption LSC is required to improve the PCE of LSC-PV. The application of the UC LSC does not extend the PL spectrum from the LSC to the infrared, enabling use of low-cost wide-bandgap solar cells, which provides an advantage for practical LSC-PV. Here we demonstrate a triple-band absorption LSC by coupling a dual-sensitized UC LSC to a DS LSC. A perovskite solar cell (PSC) is applied as the solar cell owing to its high absorption efficiency especially at visible light wavelengths. We reveal that higher intensity PL can be obtained with dual sensitizers than with individual sensitizers; we identify a PL intensity approximately 10% higher at the optimal mixing ratio than the maximum PL intensity obtained from a single composition. The LSC-PSC achieves a maximum PCE of 8.99% with a high visible light transparency of 78%. The LSC-PSC showed a proportional efficiency in oblique illumination and maintained 82% of the initial efficiency for 300 h. We have for the first time applied dual-sensitized UC to a LSC and used the combination of a UC LSC and PSC. The introduction of higher quantum yield UCs and the rapid increase in efficiency of PSCs will enhance the competitiveness of LSC-PV.
