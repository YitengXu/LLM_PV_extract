    First published on 14th October 2015AbstractBoron dipyrromethene (Bodipy) is one of the most extensively investigated organic chromophores. Most of the investigations are focused on the singlet excited state of Bodipy, such as fluorescence. In stark contrast, the study of the triplet excited state of Bodipy is limited, but it is an emerging area, since the triplet state of Bodipy is tremendously important for several areas, such as the fundamental photochemistry study, photodynamic therapy (PDT), photocatalysis and triplet–triplet annihilation (TTA) upconversion. The recent developments in the study of the production, modulation and application of the triplet excited state of Bodipy are discussed in this review article. The formation of the triplet state of Bodipy upon photoexcitation, via the well known approach such as the heavy atom effect (including I, Br, Ru, Ir, etc.), and the new methods, such as using a spin converter (e.g. C60), charge recombination, exciton coupling and the doubly substituted excited state, are summarized. All the Bodipy-based triplet photosensitizers show strong absorption of visible or near IR light and the long-lived triplet excited state, which are important for the application of the triplet excited state in PDT or photocatalysis. Moreover, the methods for switching (or modulation) of the triplet excited state of Bodipy were discussed, such as those based on the photo-induced electron transfer (PET), by controlling the competing Förster-resonance-energy-transfer (FRET), or the intermolecular charge transfer (ICT). Controlling the triplet excited state will give functional molecules such as activatable PDT reagents or molecular devices. It is worth noting that switching of the singlet excited state and the triplet state of Bodipy may follow different principles. Application of the triplet excited state of Bodipy in PDT, hydrogen (H2) production, photoredox catalytic organic reactions and TTA upconversion were discussed. The challenges and the opportunities in these areas were briefly discussed.

1. Introduction
1.1 General background
The triplet excited state is fundamentally important in photochemistry.1–10 For example, the production of the triplet excited state upon photoexcitation is dependent on absorption of light (thus S0 → Sn transition), intersystem crossing (ISC), exciton coupling,11 charge recombination,12etc. On the other hand, application of the triplet excited state covers vast areas such as electroluminescence,13–18 photocatalysis,19,20 photodynamic therapy (PDT),4,21–24 photovoltaics,25–29 luminescence bioimaging and sensing,30–39 and recently the triplet–triplet annihilation (TTA) upconversion.40–45
Triplet photosensitizers are compounds that produce the triplet excited state efficiently upon photoexcitation.4,21,22,46 The development of new triplet photosensitizers is retarded to a large extent, due to the difficulties of molecular structural designing.47 The mechanism of the ISC of organic compounds is elusive, especially for those without any heavy atoms.1,48 The conventional triplet photosensitizers are limited to aromatic ketones49 and porphyrin derivatives.33 Transition metal complexes with precious metal atoms were also used as triplet photosensitizers.4,20,32,50 However, new metal-free organic triplet photosensitizers are rarely reported.21,33,47,51,52
On the other hand, the selection of suitable chromophores for the preparation of organic triplet photosensitizers is also crucial, e.g. for the sake of easy derivatization and photostability. Concerning this aspect, boron-dipyrromethene (Bodipy) is of particular interest, due to its robust photophysical properties, such as strong absorption of visible light, high fluorescence quantum yield (suppressed non-radiative decay), good photostablity and feasible derivatization.53–56 Bodipy was extensively used in singlet excited state-related studies, such as fluorescent molecular probes,57–65 light-harvesting arrays,66,67 molecular logic gates,68,69 dye-sensitized solar cells and photovoltaics.70–75 The study of the triplet excited state of Bodipy is still in the early stage.21,46,76,77 This review will summarize the recent developments of the study of triplet excited states of Bodipy, including the formation, modulation (controlling) and the applications of the triplet states.
One of the fascinating properties of the Bodipy chromophore is the feasible derivatization.53–56 It is easy to introduce substituents into Bodipy to tune the photophysical properties, such as the absorption/emission wavelength,56 the hydrophilicity,78–80 or the redox property.47,80,81 The feasible derivatization makes it an ideal candidate for the preparation of a new triplet photosensitizer, and it is perhaps the most investigated chromophore for triplet state production than any other chromophore, except the conventional porphyrin derivatives.47 Bodipy has being used in the triplet excited state studies.82–85 New organic triplet photosensitizers based on Bodipy have been used in photocatalysis,86,87 PDT,21,46,88,89 and TTA upconversion.85,90–92
Different from the fluorescence (S1 → S0 radiative decay),1 the triplet excited state property is more complicated. The most straightforward pathway for the generation of the triplet state is the S1 → T1 non-radiative transition. However, S1 → Tn ISC is also normal, such as for the ISC of athracene.93,94 Besides the well known heavy atom-effect, the exciton coupling11 and the population of the double substituted excited state95,96 were also reported to be responsible for the formation of the triplet excited state upon photoexcitation. Moreover, some illusive mechanisms, such as the matching of the S1/Tn state energy level, may contribute significantly to the formation of the triplet excited state.1,97 Charge recombination (CR) was also reported to be able to produce the triplet excited state upon excitation.12,98 All these drastically varied mechanisms make it difficult to design new organic triplet photosensitizers. For example, it is not a trivial task for an organic chemist to prepare organic chromophores with matched S1/T2 energy levels for efficient ISC. Actually, the molecular structure–T1 state energy level relationship of organic chromophores is not as clear as the relationship between the S1 state energy level and the molecular structure.
It should be pointed out that the spectroscopies used for the study of the triplet excited state are also different from that of the singlet excited state (usually fluorescence) of Bodipy. Most of the triplet photosensitizers do not phosphoresce in fluid solution at room temperature, thus the triplet excited state was very often studied by nanosecond transient absorption spectroscopy.99 A complimentary method is the time-resolved photoacoustic spectroscopy method, or laser induced optoacoustic spectroscopy, which is based on the photothermal effect. These methods have been used for the study of the lifetime as well as the triplet state quantum yield.100–102
2. Formation of the triplet excited state of Bodipy
2.1. Heavy atom effect (I, Pt, Ir, Ru, Br, S, etc.)
The heavy atom effect for enhancing spin–orbit coupling is the most popular method to facilitate the ISC of organic compounds. This is also true for Bodipy.85,88,103–105
In 2005, Nagano prepared 2,6-diiodoBodipy 1 as the PDT reagent (Fig. 1).88 The compound gives strong visible light absorption (molar absorption coefficients ε = 110000 M−1 cm−1 at 535 nm), and a low fluorescence quantum yield (ΦF = 0.02 in MeOH, Table 1). The low fluorescence quantum yield is a prerequisite for efficient ISC.

However, the triplet state property of 2,6-diiodoBodipy was not studied by nanosecond transient absorption spectroscopy.88 Instead, the singlet oxygen (1O2) photosensitizing ability of 1 was studied with 1,3-diphenylisobenzofuran (DPBF) as the singlet oxygen (1O2) scavenger.106 The 1O2 photosensitizing ability of 2,6-diiodoBodipy is 1.6-fold that of Rose Bengal (RB) (in methanol). Electrochemical studies show that 2,6-diiodoBodipy is more difficult to be oxidized (Eox = 1.13 V vs. SCE) than RB (0.89 V vs. SCE), thus 2,6-diiodoBodipy is more stable toward 1O2 (strong oxidant) than RB. The PDT effect on living HeLa cells was studied, and it was found that the cells were killed by photoirradiation after incubation with 2,6-diiodoBodipy 1.88
Normal Bodipys exhibits absorption in the green spectra range (ca. 500 nm), which is not ideal for in vivo PDT.23 Instead, near IR absorption is desired for in vivo PDT because deeper penetration can be achieved with near IR light. O'Shea et al. prepared brominated azaBodipy.89 AzaBodipy absorbs at 680 nm,76,103,107 which is red-shifted by ca. 180 nm as compared with that of normal Bodipy.53,54 The ε value of the azaBodipy derivatives are up to 80000 M−1 cm−1. Upon bromination, the fluorescence quantum yields (ΦF) of the compounds decreased from 20–30% to less than 1% (Fig. 2). Reduced fluorescence quantum yield upon bromination is an indication of ISC, facilitated by the heavy atom effect.
 Fig. 2  Bromo azaBodipy as the organic triplet photosensitizer showing near IR absorption.89 
The triplet state property of bromo-azaBodipy 2 was not studied by nanosecond (ns) transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy (Fig. 2).89 The 1O2 photosensitizing ability was studied by comparison with that of hematoporphyrin, a known PDT reagent. BromoazaBodipy is 4-times more efficient than hematoporphyrin to produce 1O2. However, the 1O2 quantum yields (ΦΔ) of the compounds were not determined, and thus the apparent fast 1O2 production may be also due to the stronger absorption of bromoazaBodipy than hematoporphyrin in the visible spectral region. It was found that the 1O2 photosensitizing ability was greatly reduced when the bromo atoms were attached onto the peripheral phenyl moieties and not on the π-conjugation framework of the azaBodipy. This is within expectation because the electrons in the frontier molecular orbitals must be in the immediate proximity of the heavy atoms in order to maximize the ISC. The PDT effect of the near-IR absorbing compounds was studied with HeLa cervical carcinoma cells. In a separate study, TDDFT computations give the T1 state energy level of 0.79–0.87 eV for the brominated azaBodipy, slightly higher than that of 1O2, and thus photozensitizing 1O2 is rationalized.108
Ramaiah reported iodinated azaBodipy 3 as a triplet photosensitizer (Fig. 3).76,109 The compound shows absorption at 666 nm, with a molar absorption coefficient of 69900 M−1 cm−1.
 Fig. 3  Iodinated azaBodipy as the triplet photosensitizer.109 
The triplet state lifetime of the compound was determined to be 1.6 μs by ns TA spectroscopy, which is much shorter than 2,6-diiodoBodipy (>50 μs).85 The ΦT value was determined to be 0.78 ± 0.02. The ΦΔ value of the compound was determined to be 0.70 ± 0.03. In comparison MB gives a ΦΔ value of 0.52 (Table 1).
The triplet excited state lifetime (τT) of the triplet photosensitizers, among the other photophysical parameters, is crucial for efficient PDT. The reason is that the hypoxia microenvironment of the tumor tissues makes the PDT difficult, due to the low O2 concentration in the tumor tissue. Thus, only the triplet photosensitizers with a long triplet excited state lifetime (ca. 100 μs, for example) are highly sensitive to sensitize 1O2 even at low O2 concentration, and they are more efficient 1O2 photosensitizers as compared with that of the photosensitizers with a shorter triplet state lifetime (few μs). This postulations have been confirmed using Ru(II) complexes.110 The triplet–triplet-energy-transfer (TTET) efficiency between the photosensitizer and O2 is highly dependent on the triplet state lifetime of the former.111
Thienyl-fused Bodipys 4 and 5 were also reported as organic triplet photosensitizers (Fig. 4).112 With the thiophene moiety fused into the π-conjugation framework of Bodipy, the absorption wavelength was dramatically red-shifted to 730 nm. The ε value is from 89000–200000 M−1 cm−1 (Table 1).
 Fig. 4  Bromo thienyl-fused Bodipy 5 as the triplet photosensitizer.112 
With DPBF as the 1O2 scavenger, the 1O2 photosensitizing of compounds was studied. Compound 5 shows 1O2 photosensitizing ability. But no 1O2 quantum yields were reported.112 The triplet state of the compound was not studied by ns TA spectroscopy. Recent studies demonstrated that heavy atoms, such as iodine or bromine, are not required for similar thienyl-fused Bodipy to attain ISC ability (compound 4, Fig. 4).113,114
Inspired by the feasible derivatization of the Bodipy chromophore (thus the feasible absorption wavelength tuning), and the effective heavy atom effect with iodine atoms attached at the π-conjugation framework, Zhao prepared a small library of iodoBodipy derivatives as triplet photosensitizers (7–13. Fig. 5), and the triplet excited state lifetimes were studied using ns TA spectra (Table 1).85
 Fig. 5  Bodipy-derived organic triplet photosensitizer library with variable absorption wavelength.85 Compound 14 was used as reference. 
With the introduction of different conjugation moieties onto the π-core of Bodipy, the absorption wavelength of the derivatives can be tuned from 515 nm to 706 nm.85 On the other hand, the iodine atoms were directly attached onto the π-conjugation framework, and thus the heavy atom effect was maximized. With homo- and hetero-coupling reaction, the Bodipy dimers 12 and 13 were prepared (Fig. 5). Derivatives with a significant intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) feature were also prepared (such as 9, Fig. 5). It should be pointed out that for 14, the production of the triplet state is negligible, because the iodine atom is not attached onto the π-core of Bodipy.
With the introduction of iodine atoms on the π-conjugation framework of the compounds, the fluorescence quantum yields of the compounds (ΦF < 10%) were decreased as compared with that of the unsubstituted Bodipy (ΦF = 71%). This is the indication of the probable ISC in the iodinated compounds.85
The triplet excited state property of the compounds was studied by the ns TA spectroscopy.85 For compound 8, a bleaching band at 520 nm was observed upon 532 nm nanosecond pulsed laser excitation (Fig. 6). This bleaching is due to the ground state depletion upon photoexcitation (a portion of the molecules were promoted to the long-lived triplet state). Excited state absorption (ESA) bands in the range of 450 nm, 550–750 nm were observed, which are attributed to the T1 → Tn transitions. The triplet state lifetime was determined to be 57.1 μs. The triplet state lifetime (τT), especially for the compounds with a long-lived triplet state lifetime, is highly dependent on the concentration of the compounds, and even more, the excitation laser power. Highly populated triplet excited states will suffer from severe self-quenching, and the triplet state lifetime will become shorter. This is in stark contrast to the fluorescence lifetime measurement, which is much less sensitive to the concentration and the laser power.2 Moreover, caution should be taken for interpretation of the ESA bands, especially to evaluate the bleaching band quantitatively (the molar absorption coefficient of the excited state), because very often the ESA overlaps with the bleaching bands (Fig. 6).

The reliable triplet state lifetime can be determined by concentration extrapolation into indefinitely diluted solution. Later we determined the triplet state lifetime of diiodoBodipy to be 228.9 μs.115 These triplet excited state lifetimes are generally much longer than the normal 3MLCT excited state of the transition metal complexes, which are usually less than 10 μs.4,7,8,50 Similar long-lived triplet excited states were observed for the other Bodipy-derived triplet photosensitizers.47 Notably the triplet state lifetime of 9 (τT = 4.0 μs) is much shorter than the others. These lifetimes are generally much longer than the triplet state lifetime of bromo or iodo azaBodipy (1.6 μs).76,109
The triplet state energy level is one of the crucial parameters for triplet photosensitizers.116,117 For the non-phosphorescent compounds, it is not a trivial task to derive the T1 triplet state energy level. TDDFT computations do not always give reliable estimation, especially for the Bodipy chromophores.118 Unfortunately, the relationship between the molecular structure and the triplet state energy level in normal organic compounds is unclear, and even worse, the relationship may be different from that of the fluorescence (singlet excited states). This situation is demonstrated with 12 and 13 (Fig. 5). These Bodipy dimers show much red-shifted absorption than 8 (0.33 eV of difference). However, the application of the triplet photosensitizers in TTA upconversion show that the T1 state energy level of 12 and 13 does not decrease significantly as compared with that of 8, although the S1 state energy level decreased by ca. 0.28 eV.85 Concerning this aspect, the spin density surface of the compounds gives a clue in that the spin density surface of 12 and 13 is distributed on one of the two Bodipy moieties in the dimers (Fig. 7), and thus the triplet state energy level of these Bodipy dimers does not decrease as the singlet excited state does.

The ISC rate constants of the halogenated Bodipy (Fig. 8) were studied by femtosecond (fs) TA spectroscopy (Fig. 9).119 Upon femtosecond photoexcitation, the ESA band at 340 nm decreases (Fig. 9), and a new band at 440 nm grows in at the same time (Fig. 9). The latter was attributed to the ESA of the triplet excited state of Bodipy. The rate constant of the growth was determined to be 131 ps, which was assigned to the intersystem crossing (ISC) process.119 This process is much faster than the fluorescence of Bodipy chromophores (a few ns), and thus iodination is an efficient approach for the Bodipy chromophore to form a triplet excited state.

The 1O2 generation and the triplet excited state quantum yield (ΦT) of polybrominated Bodipy were studied (Fig. 10).104,120 The ΦT value increased to 0.66 for hexabromoBodipy. The corresponding ΦΔ value is 0.64.

2.2. Bodipy-containing transition metal complexes
The heavy atom effect is not limited to bromine or iodine atoms. Precious metal atoms, such as Ru, Pt, Ir, and Re, were also widely used for the heavy atom effect, such as in the phosphorescent materials.3,7,8,36,50,121,122 The photophysical properties of the transient metal complexes with Bodipy as the ligand were also studied.
Bodipy-containing Ru(II) complexes were prepared (Fig. 11).82 In order to avoid π-conjugation between the Bodipy units and the Ru(II) coordination center, the acetylide linkers were attached onto the meso-phenyl moieties in Bodipy, which takes a perpendicular geometry toward the dipyrromethene core of Bodipy. Both complexes 18 and 19 give strong absorption at 523 nm, which is attributed to the Bodipy moiety. The absorption band of the Ru(II) terpyridine coordination center was buried in the intense absorption band of the Bodipy ligand. Interestingly, neither the fluorescence of the Bodipy ligand nor the phosphorescence of the Ru(II) coordination center was observed.
 Fig. 11  Bodipy-containing Ru(II) terpyridine complexes 18 and 19.82 
At 77 K (in a butyronitrile solid matrix), the fluorescence of the Bodipy ligand (536 nm) and an emission band in the near IR range (774 nm) were observed.82 The emission at 774 nm was attributed to the phosphorescence of the Bodipy ligand (Table 2). This is the first time that the phosphorescence of the Bodipy chromophore was observed (at 77 K). The proof for the phosphorescence assignment is the long-lifetime of the emission band at 774 nm (50 ms) and the large Stokes shift.

Nanosecond TA spectroscopy showed that a ground state bleaching band at 530 nm was observed, as well as the ESA bands in the range of 550–700 nm. Thus, it was concluded that the T1 state of the complexes was localized on the Bodipy ligand, and not on the Ru(II) coordination center. The triplet state lifetimes of complexes 18 and 19 were determined to be 8 μs and 30 μs, respectively. In comparison, the Ru(II) terpyridine coordination center, without the Bodipy moiety, gives a much shorter triplet state lifetime (a few hundred ps).6,123,124
Based on the electrochemical studies and the calculation of the Gibbs free energy changes (ΔGCS) of the photoinduced electron transfer (PET), it was proposed that a charge separation (CS) state lies below the 1π–π* state of the Bodipy ligand, which is responsible for the quenching of the fluorescence of the Bodipy ligand (although quenching of the Bodipy fluorescence by ISC, or a 1Bodipy* → 1MLCT* singlet energy transfer, cannot be excluded) (Fig. 12). Charge recombination (CR) may produce the triplet state localized on the Bodipy ligand. Down hill triplet energy transfer from the 3MLCT state will also produce the Bodipy-localized 3π–π* state. Both paths give the T1 state localized on the Bodipy ligand. The evidence for the above postulation is the partial recovery of the fluorescence of the Bodipy ligand at low temperature, and it is known that CT will be inhibited at low temperature due to the lack of the solvation effect (stabilization of the CT state, so that the PET is exoenergetic, i.e. thermodynamically allowed).

Similar photophysical properties were observed using the Ru(bpy)3–Bodipy complexes (Fig. 13).83 Ultrafast TA spectroscopy shows that the intramolecular singlet energy transfer from the 1MLCT state to the 1π–π* state takes within 1 ps. Then the CS occurs, which takes about 3–15 ps. The CR process takes about 30–200 ps, which produces the triplet state localized on the Bodipy ligands.

Different from the complexes in Fig. 11 and 13, we investigated another molecular structural motif for the Bodipy-Ru(bpy)3 dyads, i.e. the Bodipy chromophore is fully π-conjugated with the Ru(bpy)3 coordination center (22. 23 is reference without the conjugation between the Bodipy and the Ru(II) coordination center, Fig. 14).125 In 22, an ethynyl linker was attached onto the bpy ligand and the 2-position of the Bodipy chromophore. Thus π-conjugation between the two moieties was established. The molecular structural motif of 23 is similar to that reported previously (Fig. 11 and 13).83
 Fig. 14  Bodipy-containing Ru(II)(bpy)3 complexes 22 and 23. In 22, π-conjugation between the Bodipy chromophore and the Ru(II) coordination centre was established.125 
The designing rational for 22 is that the π-conjugation between the Bodipy chromophore and the coordination center may facilitate the ISC, and thus the harvested photoexcitation energy of the complex can be efficiently funneled to the triplet excited state manifold. Non π-conjugated chromophores and coordination centers may render a situation that strong absorption of visible light is observed, but the absorbed photoexcitation energy is unable to be efficiently funneled to the triplet excite state manifold, i.e. it is trapped onto the light-harvesting ligand.
The absorption of 22 (528 nm) is slightly red-shifted as compared with that of 23 (499 nm). Both complexes show strong absorption (ε = 65200 M−1 cm−1 and 76700 M−1 cm−1, respectively). The fluorescence of the Bodipy ligand was not observed in 22, whereas in 23, the residual Bodipy ligand fluorescence was observed at 513 nm (ΦF = 1%) (Table 2). Interestingly, an emission band at 750 nm was observed for 22 at room temperature. Based on the emission wavelength (large Stokes shift), the band was attributed to the phosphorescence of the Bodipy ligand. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the phosphorescence of the Bodipy chromophore was observed with Ru(II) complexes at room temperature. At 77 K, a sharp emission band at 741 nm was observed for 22. The small thermally induced Stokes shift indicates that the emission band is due to an 3IL state, not an 3MLCT state. The charge transfer emissive state, such as the 3MLCT state, usually gives a much larger thermally induced Stokes shift.
Nanosecond TA spectroscopy was used to study the triplet state property of the complexes.125 The feature of the TA spectra is similar to that of the Bodipy chromophore. Moreover, the bleaching bands also support that the T1 state of the complexes was localized on the Bodipy ligand, not on the Ru(II) coordination center. Spin density surfaces of the complexes calculated with DFT support this conclusion. Interestingly, the triplet state lifetimes of 22 and 23 were determined to be 279.7 μs and 246.6 μs, respectively (at room temperature). These long triplet excited state lifetimes are unprecedented for the Bodipy-containing Ru(II) complexes.
The ΦΔ values of 22 and 23 were determined. The ΦΔ value of 22 (0.93) is higher than 23 (0.64). The higher ΦΔ value of 22 than that of 23 indicates efficient ISC in 22 than 23, although the contribution from other factors, such as CT and CR, are unable to be excluded. The complexes were used as triplet photosensitizers for TTA upconversion, and 22 (ΦUC = 1.2%) is more efficient than 23 (ΦUC = 0.7%).
Based on the results in literature and those from our own group, we propose it is a general rule to use bulky ligands to achieve a long-lived triplet excited state, due to the reduced heavy atom effect (SOC) for these 3π–π* triplet states. In other words, the reduced heavy atom effect is sufficient for efficient S1 → T1 ISC (quantum yield is high), but it is not sufficient for the T1 → S0 ISC, because with larger ΔET1/S0, the T1 → S0 ISC requires much stronger SOC (eqn (1)).126 (1) This postulation is supported by the photophysics of the well known complex Ru(bpy)3Cl2. Note that the heavy atom effect is sufficient to ensure efficient S1 → T1 intersystem crossing, but it does not result in a fast T1 → S0 decay. The 1MLCT → 3MLCT ISC of Ru(bpy)3Cl2 takes less than 1 ps, yet the 3MLCT → S0 decay takes hundreds of ns.7 These results infer that the effect of the same heavy atom on the 1MLCT → 3MLCT and 3MLCT → S0 processes is different.
To us it is always in doubt whether non-conjugated linking of a chromophore to the coordination center will induce efficient ISC, because such a molecular structural motif is not beneficial for maximizing the heavy atom effect (the frontier molecular orbital usually does not spread to the heavy atom). No reliable conclusion can be made from the previous study of the Bodipy-containing complexes due to the lack of quantitative data. A study on the following Bodipy-containing Pt(II) complexes clarified the above question to a large extent.
In N^N^N Pt(II) acetylide complex 24 (Fig. 15), the Bodipy moiety and the Pt(II)-coordination center are not in π-conjugation due to the meso-phenyl moiety of the Bodipy chromophore. The ΦF value of the Bodipy ligand in 24 is 27%, as compared to that of the uncoordinated ligands (ΦF = 92%) (Table 3). Thus, the ISC is non-efficient upon photoexcitation into the Bodipy chromophore in 24.127 The phosphorescence of the Pt(II) coordination center (to be centered at 635 nm) was not observed in 24.

UV-vis absorption spectra and the electrochemical studies indicate that the components in 24 are in supramolecular state, i.e. there is no electronic interaction between the components in ground state. Fluorescence lifetime of 24 and the reference Bodipy ligands indicate that there is no significant fluorescence quenching at low temperature (77 K). Electrochemical studies indicate the presence of the CS state, lying between the 3MLCT state and the 3Bodipy state (Fig. 16). Due to the ultrafast ISC in the Ru(II) coordination center (>1 ps), excitation into the 1MLCT state does not contribute to the fluorescence of the Bodipy moiety, which requires 1MLCT → 1Bodipy singlet energy transfer, a slower process than the ISC of the Ru(II) coordination centre. Based on the molecular structural motif, the authors argued that the CS is non-efficient. The 3Bodipy state is populated mainly from the ISC (1Bodipy → 3Bodipy). At low temperature (77 K), the phosphorescence from the Bodipy moiety is not significant, an indication of non-efficient ISC.127 Similar photophysical properties were also observed with the C^N Pt(II) acac complex (acac = acetyl-acetonate. Fig. 17),128i.e. non-efficient ISC of the Bodipy chromophore.

In order to maximize the heavy atom effect in Bodipy-containing Pt(II) complexes, we proposed a new molecular structural motif (26, Fig. 18).129 In 26, the Pt(II) atoms are directly coordinated with the π-conjugation framework of the Bodipy chromophore, thus the heavy atom effect, and the ISC is maximized, because the electrons in the frontier molecular orbital is able to move to the vicinity of Pt(II) atoms. Strong absorption of visible light and efficient production of the triplet excited state are envisioned.129
 Fig. 18  Bodipy-containing Pt(II) complex 26 with the π-conjugation framework of Bodipy linked to Pt(II) atoms.129 
Complex 26 shows a drastically different absorption profile as compared to that of the free ethynylBodipy ligand, indicating substantial perturbation on the π-conjugation framework of the Bodipy chromophore upon coordination with Pt(II) atoms.129 This observation is different from that of the Bodipy-containing transition metal complexes, in which the Bodipy chromophore is not directly linked to the coordination centers via π-conjugation (complexes 24 and 25, Fig. 15 and 17). The absorption maximum of 26 is at 574 nm (ε = 53800 M−1 cm−1). The absorption band is broader than the free ligand (centered at 543 nm, ε = 85800 M−1 cm−1).
An intense emission band at 770 nm was observed for 26 at room temperature in fluid solution (ΦP = 3.5%) (Table 3). The luminescence lifetime of this near IR emission band was determined to be 128.4 μs. Thus based on the long luminescence lifetime and the large Stokes shift, the emission was attributed to the phosphorescence of the coordinated Bodipy ligand. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first observation of the RT phosphorescence of the Bodipy chromophore with Pt(II) complexes.129 Room temperature phosphorescence of the Bodipy chromophore indicated the efficient ISC of the 1Bodipy excited state, as well as the 3Bodipy → S0 ISC. An emission band at 660 nm was also observed, which was assigned to an 3MLCT emission. Note that the triplet state lifetime of 26 is much longer than that of the normal N^N Pt(II) acetylide complexes (usually the emissive state is in the 3MLCT/3IL feature and the lifetime is shorter than 10 μs).8 This is due to the 3π–π* feature of the triplet state of 26, i.e. the less contribution of the Pt(II) atoms to the triplet excited state.
Only the emission at 775 nm was observed at 77 K. The thermally induced Stokes shift is very small, only 84 cm−1, which indicates the 3IL feature of the emissive triplet excited state.129 With ns TA spectroscopy, we conclude that the triplet state is localized on the Bodipy chromophore of the complex. The triplet state lifetime was determined to be 125.8 μs (Table 3). The complex was used as a triplet photosensitizer for TTA upconversion, and an upconversion quantum yield of 5.2% was observed.
The molecular structural designing rational that connection of the Bodipy chromophore with the metal coordination center via π-conjugation to enhance the ISC was also demonstrated by the preparation of N^N Pt(II) bisacetylide complexes 27 and 28 (Fig. 19).130 The difference of the two complex lies in the linker between the Bodipy chromophore and the Pt(II) coordination center. 27 and 28 show drastically different absorption profiles (Fig. 20). The spectra show that the π-conjugation framework of the Bodipy moiety in 27 is drastically perturbed.

 Fig. 20  UV-vis absorption of free ligands 2-BDP, 8-BDP and the complexes 27 and 28.130 
For 28, the residual fluorescence of the Bodipy ligand was observed. The phosphorescence of the Pt(II) coordination center (at 567 nm for the N^N Pt(II) bisphenylacetylide complex, ΦP = 16%) was not observed, which is attributed to the triplet–triplet energy transfer (TTET) from the 3MLCT state to the 3Bodipy state. For 27, however, two emission bands at 631 nm and 792 nm were observed, the luminescence lifetime of 0.9 ns and the phosphorescence lifetime of 35.9 μs were observed, respectively. Thus the two emission bands can be attributed to the fluorescence and phosphorescence, respectively. The triplet state lifetime of 27 was determined to be 37.9 μs by ns TA spectroscopy. On the other hand, the triplet state lifetime of 28 was determined to be 162.1 μs. Our later study shows that the ΦT value of 27 is ca. 2-fold that of 28. These results indicate that direct metalation of the Bodipy chromophore is an effective approach to attain efficient ISC. These lifetimes are much longer than the triplet state lifetime of the normal Pt(II) complexes.8
Eisenberg used the Bodipy ligand for the preparation of Pt(II) diimide(dithiolate) complexes, with the intension of sensitizing the sensitizer, i.e. to enhance the visible light-harvesting ability of the Pt(II) triplet photosensitizer (Fig. 21).131 The Bodipy chromophore is attached onto either the bipyridine ligand (29 and 30), or the dithiolate ligand (31).131 Note that in this case the Bodipy chromophore is not linked to the Pt(II) center with the π-conjugation framework. Both the UV-vis absorption and the electrochemical data infer that the spectral properties of dyads 30 and 31 are the sum of the components of the dyads, and thus there is no significant electronic interaction between the components in the dyads in the ground state. Similar to some of the previously reported Bodipy-containing Ru(II) or Pt(II) complexes, both the mixed-metal-ligand-to-ligand' charge transfer (MMLL′CT) emission of the Pt(II) coordination center and the Bodipy fluorescence were quenched, which indicated either energy transfer or electron transfer.
 Fig. 21  Bodipy–Pt(II)(diimine)(dithiolate) dyads (29–31) showing strong absorption of visible light.131 
Femtosecond TA spectra of 30 were recorded to reveal the photophysical processes.131 Upon selective excitation into the Bodipy ligand (530 nm), the ground state bleaching of the Bodipy moiety at 530 nm was observed, as well as the stimulated emission (SE) band at ca. 600 nm. The ground state bleaching decreases significantly within 2 ps, with a decrease of the excited state absorption (ESA) at 350 nm. This process is attributed to the 1Bodipy → 1MMLL′CT singlet energy transfer. The bleaching band did not change during the following 2–6 ps, during which the 1MMLL′CT → 3MMLL′CT ISC occurred. Then the bleaching band of the Bodipy moiety increased again, with the increase of the ESA band at 425 nm (the featured ESA of the Bodipy triplet state), and this process takes 6–8 ps, which is the 3MMLL′CT → 3Bodipy intramolecular TTET.
The photophysical processes of 30 are summarized in Fig. 22.131 Upon selective photoexcitation, the 1Bodipy singlet excited state was produced, and then the singlet energy transfer took (SEnT) place, giving the MMLL′CT singlet excited state. The ultrafast ISC (<1 ps) of the Pt(II) coordination center produced the triplet excited state (3MMLL′CT). Then intramolecular TTET produced the triplet excited state of Bodipy. Thus, both the fluorescence of the Bodipy moiety and the phosphorescence of the Pt(II) coordination center should be quenched.
 Fig. 22  Energy level diagram relevant to the photochemistry of complexes 30 and 31. Reproduced with permission from ref. 131. 
The poor spectral overlap and the unfavorable dipole moment orientation in dyad 30 predict slow singlet energy transfer (calculated as 1/kEnT = 710 ps), provided the energy transfer is via the Förster mechanism (FRET). However, the experimental singlet energy transfer time is 1/kEnT = 0.6 ps. Thus it was proposed that the electron exchange is responsible for the ultrafast singlet energy transfer in 30, not the Förster mechanism.2 The triplet excited state lifetimes of the complexes 30 and 31 were not reported.131
For dyads 30 and 31, the triplet excited state is no longer localized on the Pt(II) coordination center.131 The triplet state is localized on the Bodipy ligand (confirmed by the fs TA spectra); this may change the redox property and it is probably detrimental to the application in photocatalysis. To address this problem, Eisenberg modified the molecular structures, and electron withdrawing groups were attached onto the bpy ligand (complexes 32 and 33, Fig. 23); thus the energy level of the 3MMLL′CT state becomes lower than that of the Bodipy triplet state, and thus the T1 state of the dyads 32 and 33 is localized on the Pt(II) coordination center, not on the Bodipy antenna (Fig. 23).132
 Fig. 23  Pt(II) diimine dithiolate complexes 32 and 33 containing the Bodipy antenna.132 
It should be pointed out that direct attachment of an organic chromophore to the Pt(II) center does not guarantee the long-lived triplet excited state, rather, the lifetime of the triplet state is dependent on the molecular structure of the chromophore to a large extent. For example, with perylenebisimide (PBI) attached to the Pt(II) center in a N^N Pt(II) bisacetylide complex, a short triplet state lifetime was observed (246 ns).133 Complicated mechanisms may dictate the photophysical processes, such as the symmetry of either the ligand or the molecular orbitals. These features may also dictate the ISC.48
Thompson reported the Bodipy–tetraphenyltetrabenzo-porphyrin (TPBP) Pt(II) bichromophoric complex (34) (Fig. 24).134 The goal is to prepare a broadband visible light-absorbing triplet photosensitizer, based on the energy transfer between the Bodipy antenna and the benzoporphyrin–Pt(II) coordination center. However, a fast non-radiative decay channel exists for the specific Bodipy chromophore used in the conjugates (Fig. 24). Note that there are no methyl groups at the 1,7-position of the Bodipy, and thus the rotation of the meso-phenyl moiety dissipates the energy of the S1 state. This property was later employed to develop fluorescent viscosity molecular probes.135,136 However, this fast decay channel does not necessarily mean an inhibition of FRET, provided the FRET process is faster.
 Fig. 24  The broadband visible light-harvesting Bodipy–tetraphenyl-tetrabenzporphyrin complex (34). The Bodipy chromophore (BDP) and the unsubstituted Pt(TPBP) complex (35) are also presented.134 
The Bodipy moiety shows strong absorption at 514 nm. Thus with four Bodipy antennae, 34 shows an intense absorption band at 514 nm, which is comparable to the Soret band of 35 at ca. 425 nm. Phosphorescence at 772 nm was observed for 34, which is attributed to the Pt(II) coordination center. The phosphorescence excitation spectrum demonstrated the efficient singlet energy transfer from the Bodipy moiety to the Pt(II) coordination center. The phosphorescence lifetime is 67 μs, which is much longer than the complex 35 which is without the Bodipy moieties (τP = 30 μs). Thus the Bodipy chromophore exerted a substantial influence on the excited state of the complex 35 (Table 3).
The ultrafast TA spectra of the complex were recorded upon selective photoexcitation into the Bodipy part. Singlet energy transfer in complex 34 was confirmed, on a time scale of 1/kEnT = 1.29 ± 0.11 ps. The transient spectrum indicated the backward TTET from the Pt(TPBP) coordination center to the Bodipy moiety. The rate constant is kTTET = 1.0 × 1010 s−1. It should be pointed out that this kind of ping-pong energy transfer, i.e. forward singlet energy transfer and the backward triplet energy transfer, was not observed with the FRET molecules.2
The ns TA spectroscopy of 34 was studied. Three bleaching bands at 430 nm, 515 nm, and 620 nm were observed promptly upon nanosecond pulsed laser excitation. Thus the triplet state is delocalized on Bodipy and Pt(TBTP) moieties. All the transient signals decay with the same kinetics, indicating an equilibrium between the triplet state of the Bodipy and the Pt(TBTP) moiety (fast forward and backward energy transfer). The triplet state lifetime (and the phosphorescence lifetime) is 67 μs, which is much longer than the 30 μs lifetime of the unsubstituted complex 35. This extension of the triplet state lifetime is attributed to the energy reservoir effect of the Bodipy chromophore.134
Castellano reported the Bodipy-containing Ir(III) complex 36 (Fig. 25).84 Since the π-conjugation framework of the Bodipy chromophore is isolated from the Ir(III) coordination center, thus the dyad is in supramolecular state and the components of the dyad show their respective absorption and electrochemical properties.
 Fig. 25  Bodipy-containing Ir(III) complex 36.84 
The phosphorescence of the Ir(III) coordination center was quantitatively quenched in complex 36, due to the triplet–triplet energy transfer (TTET) to the Bodipy moiety, which is at the lower triplet state energy level (ET1 = 1.69 eV) than the Ir(III) coordination center (ET1 = 1.97–2.10 eV). The formation of the 3Bodipy* triplet excited state was confirmed by the ns TA spectrum. The triplet state lifetime is 25 μs (Table 4). The phosphorescence of the Bodipy moiety was observed at 77 K, as well as the residual fluorescence of the Bodipy ligand.

The photophysics of 36 is summarized in Fig. 26. The quenching of the 3MLCT emission and the fluorescence of the Bodipy ligand can be rationalized. However, as discussed above, the quantum yield of the ISC of 1Bodipy → 3Bodipy is unclear. No residual fluorescence quantum yields, or triplet state quantum yields are available.84
 Fig. 26  The photophysical processes of Bodipy-containing Ir(III) complex 36.84 
In order to clarify the effect of different linkers between the Bodipy chromophore and the Ir(III) coordination center, i.e. either in π-conjugation or not in π-conjugation linkage, on the triplet state quantum yield of the light-harvesting antenna, we prepared the Ir(III) complexes 37 and 38 (Fig. 27).137 In 37, the Bodipy moiety is not in π-conjugation with the Ir(III) coordination center, whereas in 38 the Bodipy chromophore is in π-conjugation with the Ir(III) coordination center.
 Fig. 27  Bodipy-containing Ir(III) complexes 37 and 38.137 
The absorption of 38 is slightly red-shifted as compared with 37. The residual fluorescence of the Bodipy moiety was observed in both 37 and 38. The residual Bodipy fluorescence in 38 is only 16% of that of 37, and thus the ISC is more efficient in 38. As a support to this postulation, room temperature phosphorescence of the Bodipy moiety at 742 nm was observed with 38, but not with 37.137 The triplet state lifetimes of 37 and 38 were determined to be 23.7 μs and 87.2 μs, respectively. As further proof for the efficient ISC in 38 but not in 37, the ΦΔ values were determined to be 52% and 97% for 37 and 38, respectively (Table 4). Thus, we can draw a conclusion that π-conjugated linkage of a visible light-harvesting chromophore to the metal atom of the coordination center is crucial to attain efficient ISC.47 This property can be employed to design transition metal complexes showing effective strong absorption of visible light, yet a long-lived triplet excited state. We prepared series of complexes to verify this postulation.47
Re(I) complexes have attracted much attention due to the applications in luminescent bioimaging,31,34,138–142 photovoltaics.143 and triplet photosensitizers for photocatalysis.144–146 However, most of these complexes show weak absorption in the visible spectra region, and thus we studied the preparation of Re(I) complexes with Bodipy ligands. Based on the aforementioned studies on the Pt(II) and Ru(II) complexes, we used the π-conjugation linker motif to prepare the Re(I) complexes 39 and 40 (Fig. 28).147
 Fig. 28  Bodipy-containing Re(I) tricarbonyl chloride complexes 39 and 40.147 
Different Bodipy ligands were used in 39 and 40 to tune the absorption wavelength. 39 shows intensive absorption at 536 nm (ε = 91700 M−1 cm−1), whereas 40 shows absorption at 574 nm (ε = 64600 M−1 cm−1). For both complexes, the residual Bodipy ligand fluorescence was observed, and the fluorescence quantum yields of 39 and 40 were determined to be 0.13% and 17.1%, respectively. Thus we propose that ISC in 40 is non-efficient, which is probably due to the bulky antenna and thus the reduced heavy atom effect (electrons in the large delocalized molecular orbitals may be less likely to ‘feel’ the heavy atom effect of Re). Using ns TA spectroscopy, the triplet state lifetimes of 39 and 40 were determined to be 104.0 μs and 127.2. μs, respectively. The singlet oxygen quantum yields (ΦΔ) of 39 and 40 were determined to be 88% and 6%, respectively. Therefore, we propose that with a bulky light-harvesting ligand, the ISC efficiency may decrease drastically. This result may be useful for future designing of the Bodipy-containing transition metal complexes.
2.3. Bodipy dimers showing exciton couplings
It is known that ISC is not only dependent on the heavy atom effect. With two identical chromophores connected in close vicinity, but without π-conjugation, the exciton coupling, i.e. the interaction of the transition dipole moments of the chromophores, leads to two delocalized excited states. If the lower singlet exciton state is closer in energy to the triplet state of the chromophore, then ISC can be enhanced.11 Bodipy-dimers 41–43 were reported to show the exciton coupling effect (Fig. 29),11 with a clear indication that the absorption band of the monomer was split into two different absorption bands in the dimer (Fig. 30). 42 shows a ΦF value of 0.69. Similar Bodipy dimers showing the exciton coupling effect were reported (43, Fig. 42).148 The dimers show ΦF values of 0.67–0.76. The ΦΔ value for 43 was determined to be 0.4 (with TPP as standard, ΦΔ = 0.70 in aerated toluene) (Table 5). Thus the ISC in these Bodipy dimers is far from efficient. However, no new progress in this area has been made in recent years.

2.4. Orthogonal Bodipy dimers showing the double substituted excited state
Recently Bodipy dimers based on different structural motifs from that in Fig. 29 were reported (Fig. 31).95 The dimers 44–46 (Fig. 31) show no splitting of the UV-vis absorption bands thus the exciton coupling mechanism is excluded. The ISC in these Bodipy dimers is attributed to the closely lying or degenerated S1 states of the two isolated yet identical chromophores in the molecule. The ΦΔ values of the dimers 44–46 are 0.51, 0.46 and 0.21, respectively (Table 5). A later study shows that this approach is no longer effective with chromophores showing a red-shifted absorption wavelength.96 We demonstrated that the triplet state yield of these Bodipy dimers is high and is useful in TTA upconversion.149

2.5. Heavy atom-free Bodipy-derived triplet photosensitizers
Recently heavy atom free thienyl-fused Bodipy derivatives were reported to show efficient ISC (Fig. 32).113 Compound 47 shows strong absorption of visible light at 688 nm (ε = 211000 M−1 cm−1), the fluorescence quantum yield (ΦF) is 22%, and the singlet oxygen quantum yield (ΦΔ) is 42%.113 Femtosecond TA spectroscopy was used for the study of the singlet excited state, but no detailed information such as the intersystem crossing rate constant was reported.
 Fig. 32  Thieno-pyrrole fused Bodipy dyes showing ISC upon photoexcitation.113 
Recently Ji et al. demonstrated that fused thiophene is crucial for the efficient ISC (Fig. 33).114 For example, 53 shows a triplet state quantum yield (ΦT) of 63.7%, whereas for 54, the triplet state quantum yield (ΦT) is only 6.1%.114 The fluorescence quantum yields of 53 and 54 are 4.0% and 11.2% (Table 5), respectively. Thus it is not reliable to judge the ISC efficiency (not readily available) based on the fluorescence quantum yield. The singlet oxygen quantum yields (ΦΔ) of the compounds (58.1% and 4.9%, respectively) are in agreement with the triplet state quantum yields (ΦT). Using nanosecond TA spectroscopy, the triplet state lifetimes of 53 and 54 were determined to be 170.5 μs and 389.9 μs, respectively.
 Fig. 33  Thieno-fused Bodipy 53 and the 54 with a dangled thiophene moiety.114 
TDDFT computation indicates that the S1/T2 energy gap for 53 is small (0.24 eV), and thus S1 → T2 may be the main ISC channel. Moreover, the spin orbit coupling (SOC) is 1.3 cm−1. For 54, however, the S1/T1 energy gap is much larger (0.56 eV), and the SOC is much weaker (0.4 cm−1). Thus the efficient ISC in 53 can be rationalized by the small S1/T2 energy gap and the large SOC.114 Unfortunately, it is difficult to implement these results to molecular structure designing, since the S1/T2 energy gap is not readily available. TDDFT computations may be helpful.
Concerning the formation of the triplet excited state of Bodipy without the heavy atom effect, a C60–Bodipy dyad is an important molecular structure motif for the formation of the Bodipy triplet excited state upon photoexcitation.12
Ziessel studied the photophysics of a C60–Bodipy dyad 55 in detail (Fig. 34).150 It was found that the solvent polarity dictates the photophysical processes of the C60–Bodipy dyad. In a non-polar solvent, such as toluene, no photoinduced charge separation occurred, and this is a general rule that the Gibb free energy change (ΔG°) of PET in a non-polar solvent is less negative than that in polar solvents.151–154 Instead, singlet energy transfer from Bodipy to the C60 moiety was predicated. The ISC of the C60 moiety produces the triplet excited state,155 which is localized firstly on the C60 unit. All these processes were confirmed by ultrafast TA spectra. Although there is a modest driving force for photoinduced electron transfer from the Bodipy moiety to the C60 moiety (ΔG° = −0.18 eV), no C60 π-radical anion was detected using the fs TA spectra (the featured absorption band of C60 radical anion is at 1000 nm), upon selective photoexcitation into the Bodipy moiety by 490 nm excitation (Table 6). FRET may not be the main mechanism for energy transfer, due to the poor spectral overlap of the energy donor and the energy acceptor, as well as the weak absorption of C60 (forbidden S0 → S1 transition for C60, the singlet energy acceptor).

Using ns TA spectroscopy, equilibrium between the C60 triplet state and the Bodipy triplet state was observed, although most of the triplet state is localized on the C60 moiety. These results are interesting, since it is shown that heavy atom-free organic triplet photosensitizers can be developed with visible light-harvesting antennae and C60, with C60 as the spin converter.47
In polar solvents such as benzonitrile, upon photoexcitation into the C60 part, the S1 state is populated and it decays within 125 ps, and the CTS formed, indicated by the C60 π-radical anion absorption at 1000 nm and the bleaching band of the Bodipy moiety. The CTS decays with a lifetime of 440 ps. The energy level of CTS is positioned slightly below the triplet states of both the C60 and the Bodipy moieties, and thus no triplet state was produced by charge recombination (CR), instead the ground state (S0) was produced by CR. Photoexcitation into the Bodipy moiety gives similar photophysical processes.
In less polar solvents such as CH2Cl2 and methyltetrahydrofuran, photoexcitation into the Bodipy or the C60 units also lead to the formation of CTS. The CTS is higher in energy than the triplet state, and thus CR produces the triplet state of C60. These conclusions are based on the TA spectral data.
Using different Bodipy antennae for the dyad may change the photophysics. For example, with styrylBodipy as the antenna, no singlet energy transfer from the styrylBodipy antenna to the C60 unit was observed, and only CTS was observed upon excitation, followed by CR giving the triplet state localized on the styrylBodipy unit (56, Fig. 35).152 This result is in stark contrast to the previous study on the Bodipy–C60 dyad (dyad 55 in Fig. 34), for which the CR selectively gives the C60-localized triplet excited state.
 Fig. 35  StyrylBodipy–C60 dyad 56 with triplet state formation.152 
The fluorescence of the styrylBodipy antenna in dyad 56 was dramatically quenched, but no enhancement of the C60 emission was observed, and thus it is proposed that the photoinduced charge separation is responsible for the fluorescence quenching. Electrochemical studies show that the formation of charge transfer state (CTS) is favorable in either PhCN or toluene, with ΔGCS = −0.68 eV and −0.40 eV, respectively.152
Femtosecond TA spectra indicated the formation of a C60 radical anion, which shows absorption at 1000 nm, as well as the absorption of the radical cation of the styrylBodipy moiety at 767 nm. The rate constant of the charge separation is 3.1 × 1010 s−1, and the CR rate constant is 2.1 × 109 s−1. Nanosecond TA spectra show that the styrylBodipy triplet excited state was produced upon photoexcitation, and the triplet state lifetime was determined to be 476 μs. The photophysical processes are summarized in Fig. 36.

AzaBodipy is interesting due to its absorption in the red/near IR region (600–700 nm).89,107 Note that the normal Bodipy gives absorption at about 500 nm.53 AzaBodipy was used for preparation of dyad 57 (Fig. 37).156
 Fig. 37  AzaBodipy–C60 dyad.156 
The fluorescence of the azaBodipy antenna was significantly quenched in dyad 57, which is attributed to electron transfer. This postulation was confirmed by the observation of the near IR absorption of the C60 radical anion at 1000 nm in the fs TA spectra. By following the kinetics at this wavelength, the rate constant of the charge separation (CS) was determined to be 1.0 × 1012 s−1, and the CR process occurs with a rate constant of 5.0 × 109 s−1. The T1 state energy level of the azaBodipy (0.79–0.87 eV),108 which is much lower than that of C60 (1.62 eV).155 Thus the CR may produce the triplet state of the azaBodipy moiety. The formation of the azaBodipy triplet state was confirmed by ns TA spectra. The triplet state lifetime was determined to be 83.3 μs.
Our group prepared Bodipy–C60 dyads 58 and 59 (Fig. 38).90 For 58, the absorption band is centered at 515 nm (ε = 70400 M−1 cm−1). For 59, the absorption wavelength is red-shifted to 590 nm (ε = 82500 M−1 cm−1). The fluorescence of the antenna was significantly quenched in the dyads, indicating singlet energy transfer, although CS can't be excluded, especially in polar solvents. ns TA spectra show that for both dyads, the triplet states localized on the C60 moieties were produced upon photoexcitation, indicated by the ESA band of the T1 state of C60 at 720 nm (Fig. 39). The triplet state lifetimes of 58 and 59 were determined to be 33.3 μs and 35.2 μs, respectively, which are close to the intrinsic triplet state lifetime of C60 (40 ± 4 μs).155 It should be pointed out that the localization of the T1 state is dependent on the energy levels of the Bodipy and the C60 moieties.

For 59, the S1 state energy level of the antenna decreased by ca. 0.3 eV as compared with that of the antenna in 58, but the T1 state energy level of the antenna in 59 does not decrease significantly, because the triplet state of 59 is still localized on the C60 moiety (ET1 = 1.65 eV), not on the Bodipy moiety. It was reported that Bodipy is at the T1 state energy level of ca. 1.69 eV. Thus, the relationship between the molecular structure (such as the size of the π-conjugation framework) and the T1 state energy level is far from clear for organic chromophores.
We prepared styrylBodipy–C60 triad 60 (Fig. 40), which shows red-shifted absorption than 58 and 59.157 The styrylBodipy antenna shows absorption at 645 nm (ε = 56800 M−1 cm−1). Notably the triplet state is localized on the styrylBodipy moiety, not on the C60 unit (Fig. 41 and Table 6). This conclusion is based on the ns TA spectroscopy, and the spin density surface analysis (Fig. 41).

The triplet state lifetime of 60 was determined to be 105.6 μs. Notably the 2,6-diiodostyrylBodipy gives the triplet state lifetime of 1.8 μs (Table 6).87 The reason for this drastically different triplet state lifetime is unclear. The ΦΔ value of 60 was determined to be 85%, indicating that the ΦT value of 60 is high. No femtosecond transient absorption spectra of the triad were studied, and thus it is still open for question whether the triplet state is produced by CR or by backward triplet–triplet energy transfer from the C60 moiety to the styrylBodipy moiety.
We studied the formation of the triplet state of styrylBodipy via intermolecular energy transfer by C60-containing and Bodipy hydrogen bonding modules 61–64 (Fig. 42).15861 is the hydrogen bonding module with C60 as the spin converter, and 62–63 are the hydrogen bonding modules with Bodipy or styrylBodipy as the antenna, which are energy donors. Titration of the Bodipy antenna with the C60 module induces fluorescence quenching, which indicated either singlet energy transfer or electron transfer. Electrochemical studies indicated that intra-assembly photoinduced electron transfer is prohibited, and thus the intra-assembly singlet energy transfer is the most probable mechanism for the fluorescence quenching of the antenna.
 Fig. 42  Hydrogen bonding modules for the formation of the triplet excited state of Bodipy. 62–64 are light-harvesting modules, and 61 is the triplet formation module (singlet energy acceptor and triplet energy donor).158 
Based on the nanosecond transient absorption spectra, triplet state localized on the C60 moiety was observed for the hydrogen bonding assembly of 61·62. For 61·63 and 61·64, however, the triplet state localized on the styrylBodipy moiety was also observed. This result is due to the much lower T1 state energy level of the styrylBodipy (ca. 1.0 eV, based on TD-DFT computation),159 than the C60 moiety (1.62 eV).155 The formation of the triplet state localized on the styrylBodipy is most probably due to the intra-assembly TTET. By using the non-hydrogen bonded mixture of the reference modules we demonstrated that the production of the styrylBodipy-localized triplet state for the hydrogen assemblies is not due to intermolecular TTET, which gives slow energy transfer kinetics.158
Formation of the Bodipy triplet state by CR is not limited to the C60–Bodipy dyads. A Bodipy-N-methylpyridinium dyad 65 was reported to produce a triplet state upon CR (Fig. 43).160 The fluorescence of the Bodipy moiety was quenched significantly in 65. The fluorescence quantum yield is only 0.5%, and the majority of the emission of 65 are attributed to the emission from CTS, which is centered at 610 nm, a much longer wavelength than the Bodipy.
 Fig. 43  Bodipy-N-methylpyridinium dyad.160 
With nanosecond transient absorption spectra, the triplet state of the Bodipy chromophore was observed, with a triplet state lifetime of 2.0 ± 0.5 μs. Interestingly, this lifetime is much shorter than that of the diiodoBodipys (generally longer than 50 μs).85 The quantum yield for formation of the triplet state (ΦT) is ca. 75%. Such a high triplet state quantum yield will be interesting for applications.160
2.6. Using the FRET effect in designing triplet photosensitizers: broadband visible light-absorption
FRET was extensively used for designing fluorescent molecular probes,107 light-harvesting molecular arrays,66,67,161 and photosensitizers for solar cells.162 However, FRET was rarely used for designing of triplet photosensitizers.47,131,134 One of the advantages of the FRET-based triplet photosensitizers is the broadband absorption of the visible light absorption, and thus photosensitizing ability can be improved if a broadband light source, such as solar light, was used.
Previously a Bodipy–PtTPTBP (TPTBP = tetraphenyl-tetrabenzoporphyrin) conjugate (compound 34, Fig. 24) was prepared, and singlet energy transfer from the peripheral Bodipy moieties to the central PtTPTBP coordination center was observed by femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy.134 Interestingly, backward triplet energy transfer from the PtTPTBP coordination center to the Bodipy moieties was also observed. Triplet state equilibrium was proposed and the phosphorescence lifetime of the conjugate is 67 μs (was attributed to the Pt(II) coordination center; the Bodipy moieties are non-emissive), which is much longer than the reference complex which contains no Bodipy moieties (30 μs). Other Bodipy-containing Pt(II) complexes were also studied and similar forward singlet energy transfer and backward triplet energy transfer were observed.131
Our group developed the organic mimics of the above dye-precious metal complex conjugates. We designed the dyads 66–68 with Bodipy and iodoBodipy moieties (Fig. 44).115 In 66, 67 and 68, the Bodipy moiety gives a shorter absorption wavelength than the iodoBodipy moieties, and its emission band overlaps with the absorption of the diiodoBodipy moiety. Efficient FRET was observed for 66–68 based on comparison of the fluorescence excitation spectra with the UV-vis absorption spectra. Moreover, the diiodoBodipy moiety in 66 is the spin converter.85 The absorption wavelength range of 66, 67 and 68 is broader than diiodoBodipy.115 Based on ns TA spectra, we found that the triplet state of the dyads is delocalized on the two Bodipy moieties in the dyads, i.e. a triplet state equilibrium was established. The triplet state lifetimes of the dyads 66, 67 and 68 were determined to be 286.1, 241.6 and 262.2 μs, respectively (Table 7).

In order to obtain dyads with broadband absorption in the more red-shifted wavelength range, we used Bodipy, or carbazole-conjugated Bodipy as the energy donor (variable absorption wavelength was achieved), and diiodo-azaBodipy as the energy acceptor to prepare triplet photosensitizers (triad 69 and 70, Fig. 45).163 The singlet energy transfer efficiency was determined to be 40–50% by comparison of the fluorescence excitation spectra and the UV-vis absorption spectra. It was proposed that this method is more reliable than the very often used energy donor quenching evaluation approach,164 although this method of comparison of the excitation/absorption spectra gives apparently a lower energy transfer efficiency value.
 Fig. 45  Diiodo-azaBodipy derived broadband visible light-absorbing triplet photosensitizers 69 and 70.163 
The singlet energy transfer in triads 69 and 70 was confirmed by the femtosecond transient absorption spectra, and the FRET rate constants were determined to be (5.1 ± 0.4) × 1011 s−1 and (4.3 ± 0.3) × 1010 s−1, respectively. The different energy transfer rate constants were attributed to the different spectral overlap in triads 69 and 70. The energy donor and the acceptor in triad 69 show better spectral overlap than that in 70. It should be pointed out that the singlet energy transfer mechanism for 70 is probably through-bond-energy-transfer (TBET), not FRET, because the spectral overlap is poor, which is detrimental to the FRET.2 Based on ns TA spectra, we concluded that the triplet state is localized on the diiodoazaBodipy moieties. The triplet state lifetimes of 69 and 70 were determined to be 4.1 μs and 5.5 μs, respectively.
Rhodamine is a well known visible light-absorbing chromophore, and has been widely used in the preparation of FRET molecular dyads.165–167 However, no application of rhodamine in the construction of an organic triplet photosensitizer was reported. Rhodamine normally shows weak ISC.168 On the other hand, rhodamine derivatives usually contain a carboxylic moiety, which may complicate the application due to the acid/base- or solvent-driven reversible spirolactam ↔ opened amide transformation.166,169 The spirolactam structure of rhodamine gives no visible light-absorption, while the opened-amide form gives strong absorption at ca. 570 nm.166 In order to eliminate this complicity in the photophysical study, we used a rhodamine framework which is without the carboxylic moiety for the preparation of broadband visible light absorbing triplet photosensitizers 71 and 72 (Fig. 46).159
 Fig. 46  Rhodamine-diiodo-styrylBodipy dyad triplet photosensitizers (71 and 72) which give broadband visible light-absorption.159 
In dyads 71 and 72, rhodamine was used as a singlet energy donor and diiodostyrylBodipy was used as a singlet energy acceptor, as well as a spin converter for triplet formation, so that these conjugates can be used as broadband visible light-absorbing triplet photosensitizers.47 The UV-vis absorption of 71 indicated that there is no strong interaction between the components in the ground state. Fluorescence quenching of the rhodamine part in 71, and the comparison of the fluorescence excitation spectrum and the UV-vis absorption spectrum of 71 supports singlet energy transfer (the efficiency is calculated to be ca. 50%). Femtosecond TA spectra indicate the FRET rate constant of dyad 71 is kFRET = 6.7 × 1011 s−1. The triplet state localized on the styrylBodipy moiety was observed. The triplet state lifetimes of 71 and 72 were determined to be 1.64 μs and 3.29 μs, respectively (Table 7). For 71, the ΦΔ value was determined to be 52% upon excitation of the rhodamine part.159 At a longer excitation wavelength, i.e. upon excitation into the styrylBodipy moiety, the ΦΔ value increased to 73%. The 1O2 photosensitizing ability of 71 is higher than the diiodostyrylBodipy reference compound which contains only a single light-harvesting chromophore.
3. To switch the triplet excited state of Bodipy
Switching or modulation of the singlet excited state of Bodipy gives a vast amount of functional materials, such as fluorescent molecular probes,57 molecular logic gates,170–175 and visible light-harvesting molecular arrays.67 Similarly, it will be important to modulate the triplet excited state of Bodipy. However, the related research is still in the infancy and we believe that this area will flourish. Due to the difference of the energy levels and the spin multiplicity of the triplet state and the singlet excited state, the principles governing the modulation of the triplet excited state may be different from the modulation of the singlet excited states, and this postulation was supported by preliminary studies.176 Herein we summarize the recent development on the switching/modulation of the triplet excited states of Bodipy.
3.1. Switching the triplet state with the controlling PET effect
PET is one of the most popular mechanisms to switch the singlet excited state of organic chromophores,57 including Bodipy (such as fluorescence).177,178 Concerning the controlling of the triplet excited states, previously O'shea studied the acid-activated PDT effect of the azaBodipy derivatives under neutral and acidic conditions (Fig. 47).10374–76 contain amino groups, and thus protonation of the amino moiety may inhibit the PET,57 as a result the 1O2 photosensitizing ability may be enhanced. This molecular designing rational is based on the study of the PET modulated fluorescence.5776 shows in vitro PDT activity toward MRC5 cell lines. With DPBF as the 1O2 scavenger, the 1O2 photosensitizing ability was enhanced for 73 and 74 in the presence of acid. The triplet state was not studied in detail by nanosecond transient absorption spectroscopy.

A molecular logic gate based on Bodipy was reported (77), with the 1O2 photosensitizing as the output (Fig. 48).179 The crown ether moiety in 77 is the Na+ binding site, whereas the pyridine moiety is the acceptor for H+. It was shown that in the presence of only Na+ or only H+ (TFA in acetonitrile), the 1O2 production is weak. It is only in the presence of both Na+ and H+, the 1O2 production was greatly enhanced. It was proposed that the enhanced 1O2 production in the presence of acid is due to the red-shifting of the absorption band upon protonation of the pyridine moiety (from 630 nm to 660 nm) (Table 7), as a result, the absorption band at 660 nm matches the light source better (660 nm LED array), and thus the production of 1O2 was enhanced.
 Fig. 48  Bodipy derived molecular logic gate with 1O2 production as an output.179 
Akkaya prepared Bodipy dyad logic gates with 1O2 photosensitizing ability as one of the outputs (Fig. 49).69,180 A Bodipy derived dyad 78 was prepared. The diiodostyrylBodipy part is the FRET energy donor, and the uniodinated styrylBodipy part is the energy acceptor. The ISC of the singlet energy donor is assumed to be quenched by FRET, and thus, no 1O2 photosensitizing ability should be observed for the dyad. However, another possibility exists, i.e. there is intramolecular TTET and the triplet energy acceptor shows a short-lived triplet excited state, which is inefficient to photosensitize singlet oxygen (1O2).

With addition of acid, i.e. upon protonation of the uniodinated styrylBodipy unit, the absorption of the singlet energy acceptor is blue-shifted, and thus the initial FRET is inhibited (which was assumed to be competitive to the ISC); as a result, the 1O2 photosensitizing ability of the iodinated styrylBodipy unit was observed.69 Upon addition of acid, the 1O2 photosensitizing ability of compound 78 was enhanced by 7-fold.
3.2. Chemical-activated triplet photosensitizers
The triplet excited state can be switched by chemical inputs.181,182 For example, thiol-activated 1O2 photosensitizer 79 was studied (Fig. 50).183 Thiol compounds are biologically significant, for example, it was known that the concentration of glutathione (GSH) in cancer cells is much higher than that in normal cells. Thus a thiol-activatable PDT reagent can be used as a targeted PDT reagent. To achieve this goal, a 2,4-dinitrobenzenesulfonate (DNBS) moiety was attached onto the dibromostyrylBodipy triplet photosensitizer (Fig. 50). Previously it was known that DNBS is an electron trap to quench the fluorescence, i.e. for caging of fluorescence, and thiol-selective fluorescent molecular probes have been developed using this strategy.184–188 In photosensitizer 79 (Fig. 50), DNBS was presumably used for quenching the triplet excited state, probably via the PET process.183
 Fig. 50  Caged triplet photosensitizer based on dibromostyrylBodipy 79, and the reference compound 80.183 Reproduced with permission from ref. 183. 
The photosensitizer gives strong absorption at 650 nm. Without thiols such as GSH, the caged photosensitizer hardly gives any 1O2 production upon photoexcitation. In the presence of GSH, the cleavage of the DNBS moiety can be traced by the fluorescence recovery at 683 nm. The effect of the caging effect of the DNBS moiety on the triplet state formation (thus the 1O2 photosensitizing ability) was demonstrated by the comparison of the 1O2 photosensitizing ability of 79 and the reference photosensitizer 80. It was shown that the 1O2 photosensitizing ability of sensitizer 80 is much more efficient than the caged photosensitizer 79. The In vivo photodynamic effect of 79 was demonstrated with HCT116 cells. Interestingly, no phototoxicity was found for 79 toward normal cells, such as MRC-5 cells.
With compounds 81 and 82 (Fig. 51), we systematically studied the different quenching effect of the DNBS moiety on the fluorescence (singlet excited state) and the triplet state of Bodipy in detail.176
 Fig. 51  Compounds used for comparison of the different quenching effect of DNBS on the singlet excited state (fluorescence. 81) and the triplet state of the Bodipy chromophore (82).176 
The quenching effect of DNBS on the fluorescence (singlet excited state) of Bodipy was studied with compound 81. It was shown that the fluorescence of compound 81 (ΦF = 0.6%) is greatly reduced as compared to Bodipy (ΦF = 90%). The fluorescence lifetime was reduced to 1.67 ns for compound 81, as compared with the lifetime of 3.86 ns for Bodipy.
The Gibbs free energy changes () of the PET process of 81 was calculated based on the electrochemical and spectral data. The results show that the PET process for 81 is thermodynamically allowed in solvents of toluene, CH2Cl2 and acetonitrile. The  values were calculated to be −0.27 eV, −0.61 eV and −0.71 eV, respectively. The energy levels of the charge transfer states (CTS) of 81 in different solvents were also calculated to be 2.15 eV, 1.81 eV and 1.71 eV in toluene, dichloromethane and acetonitrile, respectively. Note that the S1 state (emissive state) of Bodipy is ca. 2.48 eV. Thus the quenched fluorescence of compound 81 can be fully rationalized by the low-lying CTS, which is below the S1 state. These data are in full agreement with the fluorescence quenching experimental results.176
On the other hand, we found that the PET in 82 is prohibited. For example, the  values for 82 in toluene, dichloromethane and acetonitrile were calculated to be +0.90 eV, +0.46 eV and +0.33 eV (with the triplet state of Bodipy as the electron donor). The CTS energy level was also calculated for 82. The energy levels of the CTS are 2.42 eV, 1.98 eV and 1.85 eV. All these CTS energy levels are higher than the T1 state energy levels of the Bodipy moiety (ca. 1.52 eV). Thus, the triplet state of 82 is unlikely to be quenched efficiently by the putative PET. Experimentally, we found that the 1O2 quantum yield of 82 does not increase significantly upon cleavage of the DNBS (electron acceptor). For example, the ΦΔ value of 82 in acetonitrile is 74%, and it increases only slightly to 88% upon cleavage of the DNBS by thiols. Note that diiodoBodpy gives a ΦΔ value of 79%.87 This result is in stark contrast to the distinct switch-ON effect of fluorescence in 81 upon cleavage of the DNBS moiety. In less polar solvents, such as toluene and dichloromethane, the ΦΔ value of 82 increases only slightly upon cleavage of the DNBS moiety by thiols.176 The triplet state lifetime of 82 is only increased from 24.7 μs to 86.0 μs (in CH3CN), upon cleavage of the DNBS with thiols. In less polar solvents, no significant triplet state lifetime changes were observed with cleavage of the DNBS moiety. For example, in CH2Cl2, the triplet state lifetime of 82 was determined to be 166.6 μs and 168.1 μs, in the absence and presence of thiols, respectively. Thus, we conclude that the triplet state of the Bodipy moiety in 82 was not significantly quenched by DNBS (PET) (Table 8).

Based on the above analysis, it is clear that the effect of the same electron acceptor on the singlet and the triplet excited state of the same chromophore may vary drastically. This preliminary conclusion is reasonable, since the driving force for the PET with the molecule in the singlet excited state and the triplet excited state should be drastically different because of the large energy level difference of the singlet and triplet excited states of Bodipy (or other normal chromophores); thus according to the Weller equation, the  value will be different for the singlet excited state and the triplet excited state.152
We prepared an acid-responsive Bodipy-based dyad triplet photosensitizer 83 (Fig. 52), to study the modulation of the triplet by controlling FRET, as well as ICT.189 In 83, the diiodostyrylBodipy unit is the triplet-formation unit, and the dimethylaminostyrylBodipy part is the acid-responsive part, for which the absorption wavelength and the S1 state energy level can be changed by protonation.190 Protonation of the dimethylamino group will change the absorption wavelength (singlet excited state energy level),190 and most probably also the T1 state energy level of the moiety.
 Fig. 52  Acid-responsive Bodipy based dyad triplet photosensitizer.189 
The fluorescence intensity of 83 decreased in polar solvents, but the emission wavelength did not change.189 With reference compounds, we confirmed that the emission of 83 is due to the diiodostyrylBodipy unit. The changing of the fluorescence emission intensity is due to the modulated FRET effect by protonation of the dimethylamino group. The dimethylaminostyrylBodipy part is the singlet energy acceptor, yet it shows shorter absorption wavelength than the singlet energy donor. This is due to the larger Stokes shift of the dimethylaminosytyrlBodipy part, and this is a rare example in FRET that the singlet energy acceptor shows a shorter absorption wavelength than the energy donor. Normally, the singlet energy acceptor in FRET gives a longer absorption wavelength than the singlet energy donor.2,67,191 As proof of these postulations, the reference compound of the dimethylaminostyrylBodipy showing a solvent-polarity-dependent fluorescence emission wavelength was studied.189,190 The two units in 83 (diiodoBodipy and the uniodinated Bodipy parts) give absorption at 586 nm and 663 nm, respectively. Upon addition of acid HCl (in mixed MeCN/H2O, 9:1, v/v), the absorption band at 586 nm decreased, while a new absorption band at 552 nm developed. The absorption band at 663 nm did not change.
The triplet excited state of 83 was studied by ns TA spectroscopy.189 In toluene, triplet state localized on the diiodostyrylBodipy part was observed, with a triplet state lifetime of 1.6 μs. In polar solvents of DCM and MeCN, however, no triplet state was observed. This result can be attributed to either an efficient FRET, or the formation of the triplet state localized on dimethylaminostyrylBodipy by intramolecular TTET, which is very short-lived. Based on the fluorescence study, it is more likely that the TTET occurred, and the triplet state localized on the dimethylaminostyrylBodipy part was produced, but it is short lived, probably quenched by the ICT effect.189 Upon addition of acid (protonation of the dimethylamino group), triplet state localized on the diiodostyrylBodipy moiety was observed, as well as slight population of the protonated dimethylaminostyrylBodipy moiety (in mixed MeCN/H2O, 9:1, v/v). Thus switching of the triplet state by acid was observed in polar solvents. The switching effect was demonstrated by 1O2 photosensitizing. For 83, the ΦΔ value is 6.0% (in mixed MeCN/H2O, 9:1, v/v). Upon addition of acid, the ΦΔ value increased to 59.2%.
We also prepared styrylBodipy–C60 dyads for triplet excited state switching (84 and 85, Fig. 53).192 The switching is based on either the acid-inhibited PET (84 with styrylBodipy as the energy donor and the C60 unit as the energy acceptor), or the acid-activated FRET-ISC-TTET cascade photophysical processes (85).
 Fig. 53  Acid-responsive Bodipy–C60 dyad triplet photosensitizer.192 
In 84, the S1 state energy level of the antenna is higher than the S1 state of the fullerene, thus singlet EnT from the styrylBodipy moiety to the C60 unit is probable. In toluene, the triplet state localized on the styrylBodipy part was observed (τT = 168.6 μs). In polar solvents such as dichloromethane, however, no triplet excited state signal was observed. This result is attributed to the electron transfer in dichloromethane (ΔGCS = −0.10 eV), but not in toluene (ΔGCS = +0.40 eV). ICT of the styrylBodipy may also contribute to the different triplet state property in different solvents. Upon addition of acid, the absorption band at 623 nm decreased, and the absorption band at 573 nm developed. Upon addition of acid, thus protonation of the dimethylamino group, the triplet state was observed for 84 in polar solvents, with a triplet state lifetime of 4.4 μs. Thus in polar solvents, the formation of the long-lived triplet state is switched on by inhibition of the PET process between the antenna and the C60 moieties, as well as the ICT effect of the dimethylaminostyrylBodipy moiety.
For 85 (Fig. 53), the photophysical processes are different from that of 84. Firstly, the S1 state energy level of the antenna is lower than that of C60. Thus even in non-polar solvents such as toluene, no triplet state was observed for 85, notably PET is prohibited for 85 in toluene (ΔGCS = +0.31 eV), and thus the lack of formation of triplet state of the styrylBodipy unit can only be attributed to the frustrated singlet energy transfer, not any PET or ICT processes. Upon addition of acid, the absorption band of the antenna at 721 nm decreased, and an absorption band at 627 nm appeared. The triplet state was observed for 85 upon protonation, even in a polar solvent such as dichloromethane. The triplet state lifetime is τT = 74.8 μs.
3.3. Photoswitching of the triplet excited state of Bodipy
Besides the chemical-stimulated triplet state switching, light-switching is of particular interest, because it is a minimal invasive method.193,194 Light-switching of the triplet state of Ru(II) and Ir(II) complexes by using photochromic compounds has been studied.195–197 On the other hand, the fluorescence (singlet excited state) of Bodipy was also switched by photochromic units.198–201 However, to the best of our knowledge, the triplet state of Bodipy has never been photoswitched.
Inspired by the study of switching the 1O2 photosensitizing ability of ZnTPP (TPP = tetraphenylporphyrin) by photochromic dithienylethene (DTE),202 recently our group used DTE compounds to control the triplet state property of diiodoBodipy (Fig. 54).203 DTE is a well known photochromic chromophore, due to the distinctly different absorption and the excellent stability of the two isomers.193
 Fig. 54  Photoswitching of the triplet state of diiodoBodipy by using DTE, via intermolecular TTET.203 
It is well known that the singlet excited state energy level of DTE-1(o) and DTE-1(c) is different (therefore it is photochromic!). For example, the S1 state energy level of DTE-1(o) is 4.79 eV, and the S1 state energy of the DTE-1(c) is 2.18 eV. Actually the T1 state energy level of the DTE change substantially upon photocyclization/photoreversion.195,204,205 The T1 state energy of the DTE-1(o) is 1.97 eV, and it is 1.23 eV for the DTE-1(c).195 Note that the T1 state energy level of diiodoBodipy is ca. 1.50 eV (Fig. 54).85 Thus, the T1 state of the diiodoBodipy can probably be quenched by DTE-(c), via intermolecular TTET (the long-lived triplet excited state of diiodoBodipy makes this process efficient), but not by DTE-(o) (Fig. 54). Since the DTE-(o) and DTE-(c) is reversibly transformed by UV/visible light irradiation, the T1 state lifetime of diiodoBodipy can be reversibly reduced by light. Note that the singlet excited state of diiodoBodipy (or other chromophores) is unlikely to be significantly quenched via intermolecular energy transfer because the singlet excited state lifetime is much shorter than the triplet excited state.2
The quenching constant of DTE-(c) on the triplet state of diiodoBodipy was determined to be k = (3.05 ± 0.11) × 105 M−1 by using ns TA measurements. The triplet excited state lifetime of diiodoBodipy can be quenched from 84.7 μs to 15.9 μs, in the presence of the closed form of DTE.203 We also used this switch to control the TTA upconversion, and a distinct upconversion switching effect was observed.203
Note that the success of using DTE-(c) as a quencher for the T1 state of diiodoBodipy is due to the ‘dark quencher’ feature of DTE-(c). That is, photoreversion (closed form → open form of DTE) occurs with a much lower quantum yield (ΦC→O = 0.045) than the UV-driven photocyclization quantum yield (ΦO→C = 0.299), and also importantly, the fact that the T1 state of DTE-(c) is short lived (much shorter than 1 ns).195 Thus DTE-(c) is a ‘dark’ triplet state quencher, because no further intermolecular process can be initiated efficiently with the shorted-lived triplet state localized on the DTE-(c) moiety.
We also studied the photoswitching of the triplet state of 2,6-diiodoBodipy with the DTE moiety in a molecular triad (86. Fig. 55).206 Upon photocyclization of the DTE unit, the triplet state lifetime of the diiodoBodipy unit in 86 is decreased from 105.1 μs to 40.9 μs. Calculation of the  value indicated that PET is thermodynamically prohibited for 86 with the DTE either in the open form or the closed form. Thus the decrease of the triplet state lifetime of the diiodoBodipy moiety is due to TTET. The formation of the triplet state of the diiodoBodipy is also inhibited by the singlet energy transfer to the closed-DTE moiety, demonstrated by the quenching of the fluorescence of the diiodoBodipy part upon photocyclization of the DTE unit.206
 Fig. 55  Photoswitching of the triplet state of diiodoBodipy by using DTE, via intramolecular TTET.206 
It should be pointed out that a photostationary state (PSS) is always established for the photochromic compounds,193,207 and thus the photocyclization of the DTE unit in 86 is incomplete (the closed form is 85.2% of the mixture at the PSS, by HPLC analysis).206 Therefore, the triplet excited state lifetime of diiodoBodipy with DTE in 86 in the closed form may be due to the intermolecular quenching, not the incomplete intramolecular TTET. We anticipate that quenching of the triplet state of diiodoBodipy by intramolecular TTET may be very efficient. Isolation of the pure 86 with the DTE moiety in the closed-ring formation may help to clarify this situation.208 The 1O2 production of 86 with the DTE unit in the opened form is 87.6%, and it was reduced to 36.9% upon UV irradiation (the photocyclization of the DTE unit). Photoswitching TTA upconversion was also performed with 86.206
For 86 (Fig. 55), excitation into the diiodoBodipy unit will not sensitize the photocyclization of the DTE unit, which is different from the previously reported DTE-containing Ru(II) complexes, for which photocyclization was sensitized by the triplet state of the Ru(II) coordination centre.195 Although it is an advantage that the photocyclization of DTE can be performed with visible light excitation via sensitizing, the DTE and the Ru(II) coordination center cannot be independently addressed. For 86, however, the two chromophores (diiodoBodipy and the DTE unit) can be independently photo-addressed.
Our group also developed a Bodipy-derived photoswitchable triplet energy acceptor (a DTE-Bodipy triad) for application in TTA upconversion (87, Fig. 56).209 The designing rational for 87 is to use the DTE unit to photoswitch the fluorescence of the Bodipy part, and thus the TTA upconversion (with PdTPTBP as the triplet photosensitizer, because of its proper triplet state energy level. TPTBP = tetraphenyltetrabenzoporphyrin). As a triplet energy acceptor, the triplet state of the Bodipy units in 87 can also be quenched by the closed-form of DTE.
 Fig. 56  Triad 87 based on dithienylethene (DTE) and Bodipy was used as a triplet acceptor/emitter in the photoswitching of TTA upconversion. The photochromism of 87 is illustrated with DTE-o and DTE-c in Fig. 54.209 
Based on the nanosecond transient absorption spectra, it was found that 87 with the DTE unit in the closed-form is a more efficient triplet acceptor than 87 with the DTE unit in the opened form. This result also indicates that DTE-(c) is a more efficient energy acceptor than the Bodipy moiety because for 87 the effective triplet acceptor is the Bodipy moiety, and for 87 with DTE in the closed form, the effective triplet acceptor may be the DTE-c unit, which is at lower triplet state energy level than that of Bodipy, and thus the driving force for the intermolecular TTET is larger. The bimolecular quenching rate constants are kq = 2.6 × 107 M−1 s−1 and kq = 6.6 × 108 M−1 s−1 for 87 with the DTE unit in the open and the closed form, respectively.
Photoswitchable TTA upconversion was observed with 87 as the triplet acceptor/annihilator.209 With the DTE moiety in the open form, TTA upconversion may be observed. Based on our previous study, however, we proposed that the intramolecular TTET may quench the triplet state of the Bodipy moiety, and thus the TTA upconversion will be switched off upon UV irradiation, with photocyclization of the DTE moiety in 87. Moreover, the singlet excited state of the Bodipy can also be quenched by the closed form of DTE. Thus, three mechanisms, the intermolecular TTET, intramolecular TTET and the FRET may play the switching role at the same time for photomodulation of the TTA upconversion with 87 as the triplet acceptor.209 A similar strategy for photoswitching of the TTA upconversion was also applied in a DTE–DPA triad (DPA = 9,10-diphenylanthracene).210
3.4. Modulation of the triplet excited state of Bodipy by competing FRET process
The formation of the triplet excited state of Bodipy can be controlled by a competing FRET process. Chromophore conjugates with such a photophysical process were rarely studied.69 We constructed a diiodoBodipy–rhodamine conjugate to study the competing ISC and FRET effect on the photophysical properties. We used cyanuric chloride as a rigid linker between the diiodoBodipy and the rhodamine moiety (89, Fig. 57).211 Firstly we prepared a Bodipy–diiodoBodipy dyad 88. Similar to our previous study,115 triplet state delocalization was observed for 88, indicating that the cyanuric chloride linker is efficient for triplet state energy transfer (probably via electron exchange (Dexter mechanism)).
 Fig. 57  Bodipy dyads 88 and 89 with a cyanuric chloride linker.211 
Without acid, the triplet state localized on diiodoBodipy moiety in 89 was observed, with τT = 51.7 μs. In the presence of acid, the featured absorption of rhodamine developed. However, nanosecond transient absorption spectra show that the triplet state is still localized on the Bodipy part, and the triplet state lifetime is 34.4 μs.
Femtosecond transient absorption spectra show that FRET to the rhodamine moiety (τ = 81 ps) is a much faster process than the ISC of the iodoBodipy part (τISC = 178 ps), yet the formation of the triplet state of Bodipy was not inhibited.
The PBI-diiodoBodipy (PBI = perylenebisimide) dyad and triad were prepared (Fig. 58).212 Based on the spectral overlap of the two chromophores, FRET from the diiodoBodipy moiety to the PBI unit is assumed. In the dyad and the triad, the fluorescence emission of the singlet energy acceptor was significantly quenched. The calculation of the ΔGCS values based on the electrochemical and spectra data indicated that PET is thermodynamically allowed for the dyad and the triad even in a non-polar solvent such as toluene. The energy level of the CST is generally lower than the S1 state of the PBI moiety.
 Fig. 58  DiiodoBodipy-PBI dyad 90 and triad 91.212 
The triplet excited state localized on the PBI moiety was observed for both the dyad and the triad upon selective photoexcitation into the diiodoBodipy moiety. The triplet state lifetimes were determined to be 150 μs and 148 μs, respectively. The ΦΔ values of the dyad and the triad (Fig. 58) were determined to be 80% and 78%, respectively. These results indicated that although the fluorescence of PBI in the dyad and the triad was significantly quenched, yet the triplet state of PBI was not quenched by PET. The energy level of the CTS is much higher than that of the T1 state of the PBI moiety. With uniodinated dyads and triads, we proved that the triplet state is unable to be produced by CR.
Femtosecond TA spectra indicated that the FRET rate constant of 90 is kEnT = 5 × 1010 s−1, larger than the ISC of diiodoBodipy (kISC = 7.7 × 109 s−1), yet the triplet state yield of 90 is as high as 80% (approximated using the ΦΔ value). These results infer that the singlet excited state of diiodoBodipy was trapped somehow from decaying by the FRET.212
Intermolecular triplet energy transfer between the diiodoBodipy and PBI reference compounds were studied by using ns TA spectroscopy. Upon selective photoexcitation of diiodoBodipy in the mixture, the transient absorption spectrum of diiodoBodipy diminished. The triplet state of PBI was observed, which is produced by the intermolecular TTET.212
In order to achieve a more significant spectra discrimination, we studied the competing FRET and ISC of diiodoBodipy–styrylBodipy dyad 92 (Fig. 59).213
 Fig. 59  DiiodoBodipy–styrylBodipy dyad 92 and a reference compound 93.213 
Singlet energy transfer in 92 was confirmed by the fluorescence excitation spectrum.  values indicate that PET is thermodynamically allowed for 92 in polar solvents, which is in agreement with the fluorescence studies. Upon selective photoexcitation into the diiodoBodipy moiety, the triplet state localized on styrylBodipy was observed, with a lifetime of 385.0 μs. This result indicated that intramolecular TTET. A ΦT value of 35% was observed for 92, as compared to 93 (for which the triplet state quantum yield is negligible) (Table 9). For 2,6-diiodoBodipy, ΦΔ = 0.85. Thus, we proposed the ISC was efficiently competed by FRET. Femtosecond transient absorption spectra indicate that the FRET rate constant of k = 6.9 × 1010 s−1 (τ = 14.5 ps), which is much faster than the ISC of the diiodoBodipy moiety.

The slow intermolecular TTET between the reference diiodoBoidpy compound and the reference styrylBodipy compound was studied by nanosecond transient absorption spectroscopy (Fig. 60).213
 Fig. 60  (a) Intermolecular triplet–triplet energy transfer (TTET) from 8 to 93, monitored by nanosecond transient absorption spectra of the mixture of 8 and 93. The concentration of compound 8 was at c = 1.0 × 10−5 M, and the molar ratio of 8:93 was 1:1. (b) The decay traces were monitored at 530 and 630 nm, respectively. The energy donor (compound 8) was selectively excited with OPO pulsed laser at 536 nm (note: excitation of compound 93 alone will not give the triplet excited state). In deaerated toluene. 20 °C. Reproduced with permission from ref. 213. 
Upon selective photoexcitation into diiodoBodipy using a 530 nm nanosecond pulsed laser, the featured triplet excited state absorption (ESA) of diiodoBodipy appeared at 350 nm, as well as the significant bleaching band at 530 nm. With the elapse of the delayed time after pulsed excitation, these feature diminished, and the transient absorption of the styrylBodipy moiety developed, indicated by the bleaching band at 630 nm and the ESA band at 370 nm (Fig. 60a). The intermolecular TTET was monitored by following the transient absorbance at 530 nm and 630 nm (Fig. 60b). In the presence of the triplet energy acceptor 93 (Fig. 59), the decay of diiodoBodipy (τ = 17.5 μs) is much faster than the intrinsic decay of the diiodoBodipy alone (τ = 133 μs). The intermolecular triplet state energy transfer rates are in the range from k = 2.5 × 104 s−1 to k = 6.0 × 104 s−1, depending on the triplet acceptor concentration. The energy transfer efficiency is up to 90%. Such an efficient intermolecular long range energy transfer will be beneficial for the application of the triplet excited states, such as in photocatalysis or artificial photosynthesis studies.214
4. The application of the triplet excited state of Bodipy
The application of the triplet excited state of Bodipy is an emerging area, such as in photodynamic therapy and photocatalysis.4,21,22,46,47,215 The two principal photophysical processes initiated by the triplet excited state of Bodipy in these applications are the triplet energy transfer and electron transfer.1,47 Concerning these aspects, the strong absorption of visible light, and the long-lived triplet excited state of Bodipy are crucial for the applications of the triplet state of Bodipy in photodynamic therapy,21,110 photocatalysis,216–220 and triplet–triplet annihilation (TTA) upconversions.40,47
4.1. Photodynamic therapy (PDT)
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a noninvasive method for the treatment of a variety of cancers by the combined use of visible or near-IR light with a photosensitizing drug. The principle is that upon photoexcitation of the triplet photosensitizer, the triplet excited state will be populated, via ISC. Intermolecular TTET will produce 1O2, which is a potent oxidant. Notably, the lifetime of 1O2 is ca. 0.6 μs,221 during which 1O2 can diffuse less than 0.1 μm. Thus PDT is a highly confined and selective treatment for cancer tissue.
The conventional PDT reagents are the porphyrin derivatives.23,89 These compounds are difficult to prepare and purify; as a result, some compounds are used as a mixture of the isomers. Concerning these aspects, the application of the Bodipy-derived triplet photosensitizers in the PDT study is promising, because the Bodipy dyes show strong absorption of visible, or near-IR light (such as azaBodipy derivatives).76,89 Moreover, the molecular structures of the Bodipy chromophore is capable of being modified feasibly, and thus it is convenient for tagging or labeling purpose.
As previously discussed, 2,6-diiodoBodipy has been studied for the PDT effect.888 (Fig. 5) shows phototoxicity toward HeLa cells (PDT effect). Upon incubation of HeLa cells with 8 (1 μM), and photoirradiation (535 nm), the phototoxicity was confirmed by staining with ethidium homodimer-1 (dead cell marker). The drawback of this compound is the visible light-absorption of the Bodipy chromophore. Near IR absorption is desired for in vivo PDT, due to the deeper penetration of the near IR light in tissues.77
Concerning this aspect, azaBodipy is the ideal chromophore due to the near IR absorption.76,109 DibromoazaBodipy (Fig. 47) was studied as a triplet photosensitizer for PDT application.89 The absorption maxima varied from 600 nm to 700 nm. Light-induced cytotoxicity was studied with MRC5-SV40 cells. The EC50 value for 76d is 1.4 × 10−8 M. With attachment of an amino group to dibromoazaBodipy, an acid-activatable PDT reagent was developed.103
In recent years, the development of activatable PDT reagents is of particular interest due to their targeting feature. Some cancer cell-related chemicals, such as thiols (GSH), enzymes, or acceptors can be used to activate the PDT effect. For example, 79 (Fig. 50) was used as a GSH-activatable PDT reagent, because the GSH concentration in cancer tissue is much higher than that in the normal tissue.18379 gives absorption in the 600–700 nm range. It was shown that upon incubation of HCT116 cells with 79, and then upon photoirradiation, apoptosis was induced.18379 showed no apparent photocytotoxicity (or dark toxicity) on the MRC-5 (human fetal lung fibroblast cells) cell line, which is a normal cell line.183
Targeted PDT reagents are of particular interest, because the treatment of the tumor tissue becomes more efficient and is confined to the tumor tissues in which the PDT reagent is selectively accumulated, to enhance their selectivity. On the other hand, the advantage of the feasible derivatization of Bodipy was demonstrated by tagging Bodipy with targeting modules to prepare targeted PDT reagents.77 For example, the 2,6-diiodoBodipy module was connected with Tyr/Ile chains in 94 (Fig. 61), which is similar to the natural TrkC neurotrophin ligand NT3. These side chains as targeting modules toward the TrkC receptor, which is associated with some forms of cancer (e.g., neuroblastoma, medulloblastoma, and breast cancer) and with melanoma.222
 Fig. 61  Double-targeting PDT reagent 94 with diiodoBodipy as the PDT module and Tyr/Ile side chains as the targeting module (the target is the TrkC receptor).222 
Compound 94 absorbs at 520 nm (Table 10). It has submicromolar photocytotoxicities to cells that were engineered to express TrkC (NIH3T3-TrkC) or that naturally express high levels of TrkC (such as SY5Y neuroblastoma lines). Control experiments showed that 94 is not cytotoxic in the dark and has significantly less photocytotoxicity toward cells that do not express TrkC (NIH3T3-WT).

A folic acid receptor was usually over-expressed in tumor cells. Thus a PDT module can be connected with folic acid to prepare a targeting PDT reagent (Fig. 62).77
 Fig. 62  Targeting PDT reagent with diiodostyrylBodpiy as the PDT module and folate as the targeting module.77 
Two folate-conjugated diiododistyryl boron dipyrromethenes (95a and 95b) were prepared and characterized by various spectroscopic methods (Fig. 62).77 The two compounds show strong absorption in the red spectral region (662 nm, ε = 61660 M−1 cm−1), and low fluorescence quantum yields (ΦF = 0.20). The ΦΔ values of these compounds were not reported.77 However, previously we have shown 2,6-diiodostyrylBodipy shows a high ΦΔ value of 69% (Table 10).87

95a and 95b exhibit high photocytotoxicity toward the KB human nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells, which have high expression of folate receptors when compared with the MCF-7 human breast adenocarcinoma cells. Higher phototoxcity was observed for 95a, i.e. the conjugate with a shorter oligoethylene glycol linker, due to its higher cellular uptake and slightly lower aggregation tendency. Its IC50 value toward KB cells (0.06 μM) is 43-fold lower than that for MCF-7 cells upon photoirradiation, while the difference is only 6-fold for the analogue with a longer linker (95b). The length of the spacer also affects their subcellular localization. While compound 95a shows high affinity toward the endoplasmic reticulum of KB cells, conjugate 11b is mainly localized in the lysosomes.
Due to the feasibly derivatizable molecular structures, and the tunable absorption wavelength, we envision that Bodipy derivatives will play a significant role in the development of new activatable PDT reagents.
4.2. TTA upconversion
TTA upconversion shows the advantage of efficient harvesting of the excitation light, high upconversion quantum yields, and supramolecular features of the system, so that tuning is more feasible than the conventional upconversion methods.40–45 Moreover, non-coherent light is sufficient for TTA upconversion, such as solar light.223
The desired photophysical properties of the triplet photosensitizers for TTA upconversion include strong absorption of visible light and a long triplet state lifetime. These properties will make the intermolecular TTET more efficient, which is crucial to TTA upconversion. Porphyrin or benzoporphyrin complexes have been used for TTA upconversion.40 Although these photosensitizers show red or near IR absorption, it is difficult to modify the molecular structures. On the other hand, the above challenges can be addressed by using Bodipy-based triplet photosensitizers.
Previously we used iodoBodipy derivatives (Fig. 5) for TTA upconversion, and satisfactory upconversion quantum yields were obtained (up to 6.1%).85,105 The advantage of using Bodipy derivatives is the tunable absorption wavelengths (from 510 nm to 629 nm for the derivatives we prepared).
We also used the C60–Bodipy dyads as the triplet photosensitizers for TTA upconversion.90–92 An upconversion quantum yield of 7.0% was observed for the C60–Bodipy dyads as triplet photosensitizers.90
Inspired by the previous finding that the triplet state can be produced by a Bodipy dimer,95 we used heteroBodipy dimers for TTA upconversion (Fig. 63).149
 Fig. 63  HeteroBodipy dimers as heavy-atom-free triplet photosensitizers for TTA upconversion.149 
Note that from 96 to 98, the structures of the two components of the Bodipy dimer show more significant differences, such as the π-conjugation framework (Fig. 63). As a result, we observed a clear trend that the triplet state formation quantum yield of the compounds decreased from 96 to 98. For example, the ΦΔ for 96 is 64%, and it decreases to 42% for 97, whereas for 98, no 1O2 photosensitizing ability was observed. For 96 and 97 the triplet state lifetimes were determined to be 115.6 μs and 140.9 μs, respectively (Table 10). No triplet state was observed for 98.

96, 97 and 98 were used as triplet photosensitizers for TTA upconversion, with perylene as a triplet acceptor/emitter. Upconversion quantum yields of 3.7% and 2.7% were observed. For 98, however, the upconversion is negligible.149
Bodipy derivatives can also be used as triplet energy acceptor/emitters in TTA upconversion (Fig. 64).224,225 The T1 state energy level of Bodipy is ca. 1.5 eV, which is lower than the triplet photosensitizers, such as Pt/PdTPTBP (TPTBP = tetraphenyltetrabenzoporphyrin).
 Fig. 64  Bodipy derivative as the triplet acceptor/emitter in TTA upconversion.224 
Bodipy-derivatives 14 and 99 have been used as triplet acceptors for TTA upconversion (Fig. 64).224,225 Note that the iodine atoms are attached onto the phenyl moiety at the meso position of the Bodipy core; thus the heavy atom effect is weak and the fluorescence quantum yields of the compounds are 69% and 78%, respectively (Table 10).224 PtTPTBP was used as a triplet photosensitizer, with a T1 state energy level of 1.62 eV. Upon 635 nm excitation of PtTPTBP, the triplet state of the Bodipy derivatives was populated by intermolecular TTET. Via triplet–triplet annihilation, green emission from the Bodipy derivatives was observed.224 The upconversion quantum yield is 7%. It should be pointed out that attachment of iodine atoms in 14 and 99 is unnecessary, although the fluorescence quantum yields of 14 and 99 were not reduced by the presence of the iodine atoms in the molecules. As proof of this postulation, we used non-iodinated Bodipy as a triplet acceptor/emitter for TTA upconversion.176,209
In order to attain a high TTA upconversion quantum yield, concerted excited state energy levels of the triplet photosensitizers and the triplet acceptor must be met. For example, a relationship of 2ET1 > ES1 is required for the triplet acceptor/emitter, to ensure the efficient TTA process. Failure to meet this requirement will reduce the TTA yield, as well as the upconversion yield. This prerequisite was not well satisfied for some typical triplet acceptors.
For example, one of the popular triplet acceptors, perylene, has a T1 state energy level of 1.53 eV, and the S1 state energy level of at least 2.78 eV; thus the requirement of 2ET1 > ES1 is only marginally met (the driving force for TTA is ca. 0.2 eV). In order to optimize the excited state energy levels, Bodipy was connected with a perylene moiety (Fig. 65) to tune the excited state energy level to improve TTA. It was known that Bodipy has a S1 state energy level of 2.35–2.45 eV, and thus 2ET1 > ES1 can be better met (the driving force for TTA is ca. 0.6 eV). It was observed that the upconversion quantum yield can be improved from 6.6% to 11.3%.226 Zhang found that using a mixture of different triplet acceptors (such as DPBF and DPA) leads to an efficient hetero-TTA process.227
 Fig. 65  Bodipy–perylene dimer 100 for tuning of the excited state energy levels to optimize TTA upconversion.226 The reference compound 101 is also presented. 
We studied the detail photophysics of a similar Bodipy–perylene dyad, with an aim to optimize the energy levels further (102, Fig. 66).228 We found that the TTA efficiency for 102 is ca. 2-fold of that of perylene. Moreover, we found that the PET is thermodynamically allowed in 102, especially in polar solvents, such as dichloromethane and acetonitrile.
 Fig. 66  Bodipy–perylene dimer to tune the excited state energy levels to optimize TTA upconversion.228 
The fluorescence of 102 in polar solvents was studied, it was found that the fluorescence of 102 was significantly quenched in polar solvents than that in non-polar solvents, yet the emission wavelength (assigned to the Bodipy moiety) did not change. Moreover, the separate components of the dyad did not show such solvent polarity-dependent fluorescence emission intensity. These results clearly indicated the PET process in 102 in polar solvents (with perylene as the electron donor and the Bodipy moiety as the electron acceptor).228 This information will be useful for future designing of dyad triplet photosensitizers. Hetero-TTA was also studied for a intermolecular approach with DPA and 1,3-diphenylisobenzofuran (DPBF).227
4.3. H2 production
Renewable energy has attracted much attention in recent years, such as the photocatalytic hydrogen (H2) production.229–233 Usually a transition metal complex was used as the photosensitizer/electron donor, with a water reduction center (such as cobaloxime complexes); H2 evolution was observed in the presence of a sacrificial electron donor, such as triethanolamine.231,232 However, the conventional Ir(III) or Ru(II) complexes give weak absorption of visible light and short triplet excited states, and thus the electron transfer process may be nonefficient. In order to improve the H2 production, photosensitizers with strong absorption of visible light and a long-lived triplet excited state are desired.
A diiodoBodipy or dibromoBodipy-binded Co(II) complex was prepared as a novel photocatalyst for H2 evolution (Fig. 67).234,235 The Bodipy moiety is the electron donor, and the cobaloxime moiety is the water reduction catalysts. The bromo- or the iodoBodipy unit show a long-lived triplet excited state, and thus the electron transfer to the water reduction centre (WRC) is supposed to be more efficient.
Four cobaloxime catalyst complexes with Bodipy chromophores are synthesized (Fig. 67).234 In contrast to the photocatalytically inactive, nonhalogenated reference complex 103, 104–107 are active for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution, with a maximum turnover number (TON) of 30.9 mol equiv. of H2 per catalyst for the mesomethylpyridyl 2,6-diiodo Bodipy-sensitized cobaloxime complex 107. It was proposed that accessing of the photoexcited triplet state of the Bodipy chromophore by introducing heavy atoms (i.e., bromine or iodine) is necessary for efficient electron transfer in this system, enabling catalytic H2 generation. Without accessing of the triplet state of the Bodipy chromophore, the singlet excited state of Bodipy (complex 103, Fig. 67) only gives substoichiometric H2.236
 Fig. 67  Bodipy-cobaloxime complexes as photocatalysts for H2 evolution.234 
4.4. Photoredox catalytic organic reactions
Photoredox catalytic organic reaction is an emerging research area.20,216–219 This synthetic methodology gives functionalized organic compounds with a concise and clean synthesis route, by formation of C–C or C–N bonds. For this kind of catalytic synthetic reaction, the photocatalyst (triplet photosensitizers) plays the role of an electron acceptor/donor, or a triplet energy donor.20 Thus, the photocatalytic activity will be improved by using triplet photosensitizers with strong absorption of visible light and a long-lived triplet excited state.47 It should be pointed out that in the following discussions, the effect of the triplet state lifetime on the photocatalytic activity is limited to the homogeneous catalysis. For heterogeneous catalysis, the catalytic activity is also affected by other factors such as charge carrier mobility.
Popular triplet photosensitizers include the complexes such as Ru(bpy)3Cl2 and Ir(ppy)3.20 These transition metal complexes show only moderate or weak absorption in the visible spectra range (ε < 20000 M−1 cm−1 in the spectral range beyond 400 nm). The absorption maximum is <500 nm, and the triplet state lifetimes of these complexes are short (less than 5 μs).20,237 Therefore, the photocatalytic reaction efficiency is low and the reaction times are usually long. We propose that the weak absorption of these complexes in the visible spectral region is due to the weakly allowed S0 → 1MLCT transition because of its charge transfer character. The short triplet excited state is probably due to the strong heavy atom effect, which facilitates the S1 → T1 ISC, but also the T1 → S0 transition, and thus the lifetime of the T1 state is short.
In order to tackle these challenges, we used diiodoBodipy derivatives that show strong absorption of visible light and long-lived triplet excited states as organic catalysts for photoredox catalytic organic reactions (Fig. 68).87 The photocatalyzed reactions were mediated by singlet oxygen (1O2), that is, the aerobic oxidative coupling of amines and the photooxidation of dihydroxylnaphthalenes, which is coupled to the subsequent addition of amines to the naphthoquinones, via C–H functionalization of 1,4-naphthoquinone, to produce aryl-2-amino-1,4-naphthoquinones (one-pot reaction), which are potential anticancer and antibiotic reagents. The photoreactions were substantially accelerated with the diiodoBodipy organic photocatalysts as compared to that catalyzed with the conventional Ru(II)/Ir(III) complexes.87 Moreover, the organic photocatalysts show excellent photostability.
 Fig. 68  Proposed one-pot reaction mechanism for the photooxidation with 8 and 108 as the organic photocatalysts to produce aminonaphthoquinone.87 
The above results show that the triplet excited state of Bodipy dyes, or more general, the triplet state of organic chromophores, are ideal for photoredox catalytic organic reactions. Along this line, we prepared C60–styrylBodipy conjugates 109 and 110 (Fig. 69), which show strong absorption of visible light (ε = 65000 M−1 cm−1 at 650 nm), and a long-lived triplet excited state (τT = 120 μs), to explore the potential of C60 for photocatalysis.157 We used these organic triplet photosensitizers as photocatalysts for the photooxidation of 1,5-dihydroxynaphthalene to produce juglone, via photosensitization of 1O2. The photocatalytic efficiency was compared with that of the conventional photocatalysts, such as Ir(ppy)2bpy, methylene blue, and C60. It was found the photoreaction rates are 10-fold that of the conventional Ru(II)/Ir(III) photocatalyst, and the reaction yields with the new organic photosensitizers are much higher. It should be pointed out that both property of strong absorption of visible light and the long-lived triplet excited state are crucial for the photocatalytic reaction.

Pyrrolo[2,1-a]isoquinoline are bioactive compounds.238 Recently a photoredox catalytic reaction scheme was developed for the preparation of these highly functionalized compounds (Fig. 70). Previously Ru(bpy)3Cl2 was used as a photocatalyst,238 but the reaction time is long (9–72 h).
 Fig. 70  Photocatalytic tandem oxidation/[3+2] cycloaddition reactions to prepare pyrrolo[2,1-a]isoquinoline.239 
The key steps of the reaction mechanism are the electron transfer between the photocatalyst and the O2, and the electron transfer between the photocatalyst radical cations and the substrate (Fig. 70).238 Concerning this aspect, C60 is a well-known electron acceptor, and thus we used Bodipy–C60 conjugates 109 and 111 as new organic photocatalysts for the reactions (Fig. 71), and a much higher catalytic efficiency was observed. For example, the reaction time required for the photocatalyst Ru(bpy)3Cl2 is 4 h, and the yield is 37%. With the Bodipy–C60 dyads as the new photocatalysts, the reaction time is only 1 hour and the yield is up to 91%.239
 Fig. 71  Bodipy–C60 dyad as 111 photocatalysts for photocatalytic tandem oxidation/[3+2] cycloaddition reactions.239 
We also used similar C60–Bodipy conjugates for visible-light-induced aerobic oxidative hydroxylation of aryl boronic acids.240 We found that C60–Bodipy dyads can act as efficient electron-mediator between the sacrificial electron donor and the substrates.
Other photoredox catalytic organic reactions, such as the aza-Henry reaction of tetrahydroisoquinoline (Fig. 72),241 and C–H arylation of heteroarenes with diazonium salts were also reported (Fig. 72).242 Iodo-Bodipys were used as organic catalysts for these different photoredox catalytic organic reactions, (Fig. 72).86 The organic photocatalysts act as either electron acceptors (reductive quenching) or electron donors (oxidative quenching) in the single electron transfer (SET) of the catalytic cycles. Different from the widely used Ru(bpy)3[PF6]2, Ir(ppy)3, or halo-xanthane photocatalysts (Eosin Y or Rose Bengal), the new organic photocatalysts show strong absorption of visible light and long-lived triplet excited states, which are beneficial for SET, a crucial step for photoredox catalytic organic reactions. The absorption wavelength of the photocatalysts was readily tuned from 529 nm to 630 nm. The three different types of organic reactions are accelerated with the new organic photocatalysts (typical reaction times are 1–2 h) compared to Ru(bpy)3[PF6]2 or Ir(ppy)3 (reaction time: 12–72 h).86
 Fig. 72  The photoredox catalytic organic reactions catalyzed by compounds 8 and 108. Photocatalytic tandem oxidation/[3+2] cycloaddition reactions to prepare pyrrolo[2,1-a]isoquinoline is not shown.86 
In order to achieve easy recycling of the photocatalysts, we immobilized the diiodoBodipy photocatalyst on porous silica,243 and an efficient recyclable photocatalyst was obtained for photoredox catalytic tandem oxidation–[3+2] cycloaddition reactions of tetrahydroisoquinoline with N-phenylmaleimides to prepare pyrrolo[2,1-a]isoquinoline. We found that the immobilized organic catalyst is still efficient for the photocatalytic reactions. The photocatalyst was easily recycled by filtration after the photocatalytic reaction.243
Moreover, the broadband visible light-absorbing Bodipy–diiodoazaBodipy 69 (Fig. 45) was used for tandem oxidation/[3+2] cycloaddition reactions to prepare pyrrolo[2,1-a]isoquinoline, the coupled photocatalytic oxidation and the Cu(I) catalyzed alkynylation reactions, and the photooxidation–alkynylation reaction with tetrahydroisoquinolin as the substrate.244 The photocatalytic reaction with the broadband visible light-absorbing organic triplet photosensitizers as photocatalysts is generally more efficient than the normal triplet photosensitizers.159,240,245
Recently it was found that the singlet excited state of Bodipy is able to catalyze the cross-dehydrogenative-coupling reactions with tetrahydroisoquinoline and nitromethane as substrates.246 The photocatalytic efficiency is close to the diiodoBodipy photocatalysts. This results is interesting since the lifetime of the singlet excited state of Bodipy is at least 106 times shorter than the triplet state of Bodipy.86 The quenching constant of the isoquinoline substrate on the singlet excited state of Bodipy is determined to be KSV = 52.8 M−1 (via photoinduced intermolecular electron transfer). We measured the same constant with diiodoBodipy and the same tetrahydroisoquinoline substrate, based on the quenching of the triplet state lifetime of diiodoBodpy to be KSV = 120 M−1. These results infer that the electron transfer between the excited photocatalyst and the substrate (tetrahydroisoquinoline) may not be the rate-limiting step of this specific photocatalytic reaction.
The application of efficient organic triplet photosensitizers as photocatalysts is still in the early stage. The results are promising and we envision that the extending of the application to other areas such as photovoltaics will be interesting, considering the strong absorption of visible light and the long-lived triplet excited state of the organic materials.
5. Summary, challenge and outlook
In summary, the production, modulation and application of the triplet excited state of Bodipy were discussed. Bodipy is one of the most popular chromophores. Different from the extensive investigations on the singlet excited state of Bodipy, such as its fluorescence and visible light-harvesting ability, the study on the triplet excited state of Bodipy is still in its infancy. The formation of the triplet state of Bodipy upon photoexcitation is usually based on the heavy atom effect (such as I, Br, Ru, Ir, Pt and Re). Moreover, new methods, such as using a spin converter (e.g. C60), or by charge recombination, exciton coupling and the double substituted excited state, were developed in recent years. The preparation of the broadband visible light-harvesting Bodipy triplet photosensitizers was also discussed. All these organic Bodipy-based triplet photosensitizers show strong absorption of visible light (ca. 80000 M−1 cm−1 in the range 500–700 nm) and long-lived triplet excited states (50–200 μs).
The switching or modulation of the triplet state of Bodipy was not investigated intensively. This is in stark contrast to the study on switching of the singlet excited state of the Bodipy, based on which vast amounts of molecular materials were developed, such as fluorescent molecular probes, and light-harvesting molecular arrays. The methods for switching of the triplet excited state of Bodipy were discussed, such as those based on the photo-induced electron transfer (PET), by controlling the competing FRET, or the intermolecular charge transfer (ICT). Preliminary studies show that switching of the triplet excited states may follow different rules as compared with that of switching of the singlet excited state. For example, the switching of the singlet excited state and the triplet state of Bodipy by a same electron acceptor (or donor) may follow a different rule, due to the difference in driving force for the PET process. We envision that investigation of the switching/modulation of the triplet state of Bodipy will give novel functional materials such as activatable photodynamic therapeutic (PDT) reagents.
Applications of the triplet excited states of Bodipy in PDT, TTA upconversion, hydrogen (H2) production and photoredox catalytic organic reactions were briefly discussed. The two principle photophysical processes involved in these applications are intermolecular electron transfer and energy transfer, which can be enhanced using triplet photosensitizers which show strong absorption of visible light and long-lived triplet excited states. The triplet state of Bodipy derivatives fulfill these requirements, and the Bodipy-derived triplet photosensitizers have been proved more efficient than the conventional triplet photosensitizers such as Ru(bpy)3Cl2 or Ir(ppy)3 for photocatalytic hydrogen (H2) production and TTA upconversion.
Despite above developments, challenges as well as opportunities still exist. For example, singlet fission is being studied for efficient formation of the triplet excited state (with a quantum yield of up to 200%) upon photoexcitation. But this strategy was not yet extended to the Bodipy chromophore. Related research will foster a new area and novel materials. On the other hand, designing of heavy atom-free triplet photosensitizers is still a major challenge for organic chemists, because the molecular structure–ISC property is far from clear. It is not a trivial task for organic chemists to design new molecules with matching of S1/Tn states to facilitate efficient ISC. The relationship between the molecular structure and the T1 state energy level of the Bodipy derivatives is almost an uninvestigated area, and it is not solely dependent on the size of the π-conjugation framework. The organic chemists must be joined by the physical chemists and photochemists to tackle the challenges. It is almost certain that the photochemistry of the triplet excited state of Bodipy, or other feasibly derivatizable organic chromophores, will flourish in the near future, because it is crucial for the fundamental photochemistry studies, and for the developments of the areas such as PDT, photocatalysis and upconversion.

 	Fig. 60  (a) Intermolecular triplet–triplet energy transfer (TTET) from 8 to 93, monitored by nanosecond transient absorption spectra of the mixture of 8 and 93. The concentration of compound 8 was at c = 1.0 × 10−5 M, and the molar ratio of 8:93 was 1:1. (b) The decay traces were monitored at 530 and 630 nm, respectively. The energy donor (compound 8) was selectively excited with OPO pulsed laser at 536 nm (note: excitation of compound 93 alone will not give the triplet excited state). In deaerated toluene. 20 °C. Reproduced with permission from ref. 213.
