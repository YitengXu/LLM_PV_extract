Ti–Nb–O compounds as some of the most promising intercalation-type anode materials have attracted a lot of attention owing to their high theoretical capacity (388–399 mA h g−1) arising from the multiple redox pairs (Ti4+/Ti3+, Nb5+/Nb4+, and Nb4+/Nb3+), high safety, and superior cycling stability. However, their intrinsic low electronic conductivity and slow solid-state ion diffusion lead to unsatisfactory rate performance. To overcome these drawbacks, various efficient strategies have been proposed to improve the performance of Ti–Nb–O compounds, especially TiNb2O7. This Review aims to provide rational understanding of how structural engineering approaches (e.g., dimensional/morphological control, doping/hybridizing with exotic elements/components, carbon coating/compositing, etc.) improve the electrochemical properties of micro/nanostructured TiNb2O7-based anode materials. In addition, other Ti–Nb–O compounds with different compositions as anodes for LIBs and micro/nanostructured TiNb2O7-based anodes for other energy storage systems (sodium-ion batteries, hybrid supercapacitors, and vanadium redox flow batteries) are discussed. Finally, the challenges and opportunities for micro/nanostructured TiNb2O7-related electrode materials for high-performance energy storage applications are highlighted.Hongkang WangHongkang Wang is an Associate Professor at the School of Electrical Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, China.

1. Introduction
Environmental pollution and the energy crisis, arising from the consumption of traditional fossil fuels, have become great challenges for human beings, forcing us to utilize renewable energy sources (i.e., solar, wind, and hydro),1,2 which highly require the support of efficient, safe and stable energy storage technologies.3–6 Among various energy storage devices, lithium ion batteries (LIBs) have become a hot research topic and formed a giant industry chain,7 since their first commercialization by Sony Corporation in 1991. In the last few decades, LIBs with LiCoO2 as the cathode and carbon as the anode have been widely used in various kinds of portable electronics.8–10 However, with the rapid development of (hybrid) electric vehicles, smart grids and so on, large-scale energy storage has become a major direction, and the current LIBs cannot meet the increasing demand for higher energy/power densities, longer cycle life, and higher safety performance.11,12
It's well recognized that LIB performance is largely dependent on the performance of electrode materials.13–17 As one of the key components in the current commercial LIBs, graphite anodes with a theoretical capacity of 372 mA h g−1 dominate the market since its first commercialization.18 As a typical intercalation-type anode material, the layered structures of graphite anodes show excellent structural stability upon lithium insertion/extraction (6C + xLi+ + xe− ↔ LixC6), endowing them with excellent cycling stability.19 However, the lithium ion diffusion rate in graphite is low, which limits its high rate performance. Besides, due to its low working potential (∼0.1 V vs. Li+/Li), lithium dendrites are formed during repeated lithiation/delithiation processes, causing the internal shorting of the battery and thus leading to severe safety issues.20,21 In addition, the low working potential causes the decomposition of the electrolyte and the formation of a solid electrolyte interface (SEI) film, which results in the low initial coulombic efficiencies of the batteries. Among the intercalation-type anode materials, Ti-based oxides and Nb-based oxides are promising high-rate electrodes and show excellent structural stability upon lithiation/delithiation.13,22–24 Especially, spinel Li4Ti5O12 is regarded as a “zero strain material” with a high working potential (∼1.55 V vs. Li+/Li), which can avoid the formation of lithium dendrites.25–28 These advantages make Li4Ti5O12 a promising anode material for LIBs with good cycling performance and high safety. However, Li4Ti5O12 has a low theoretical specific capacity (only 175 mA h g−1) and poor electrical conductivity, which limits its practical application.29,30 Recently, niobium oxides as a high-capacity anode material have attracted widespread attention and are expected to replace Li4Ti5O12 in LIBs. At present, a variety of Nb-based oxides have been reported as anode materials for LIBs, such as niobium oxide (Nb–O),31–33 lithium niobium oxide (Li–Nb–O),34,35 potassium niobium oxide (K–Nb–O),36,37 vanadium niobium oxide (V–Nb–O),38 and titanium niobium oxide (Ti–Nb–O).39–41
As a typical intercalation-type anode material, TiNb2O7 not only possesses the advantages of traditional lithium titanate materials in terms of cycling stability and long lifespan at a high rate,34 but also exhibits a much larger theoretical capacity (388 mA h g−1, one time higher than that of Li4Ti5O12 and even larger than that of graphite), owing to the multiple redox reactions of Ti3+/Ti4+, Nb4+/Nb5+, and Nb3+/Nb4+.42,43 Notably, TiNb2O7 exhibits a relatively high operating potential (∼1.6 V vs. Li+/Li), which prevents the formation of a SEI film and lithium dendrites.44,45 These extraordinary advantages, including high specific capacity, excellent cycle performance, and high safety, make TiNb2O7 a promising candidate anode material for next-generation LIBs. Although the advantages of TiNb2O7 have been recognized, the poor-rate performance has hindered its practical applications. The oxidation state of Ti and Nb in TiNb2O7 is +4 and +5, respectively. The empty 3d/4d orbitals of Ti4+/Nb5+ ions indicate that no free electrons participate in electron conduction, resulting in the insulator characteristics and low electronic conductivity of TiNb2O7.46 Meanwhile, its Li+ ion diffusion coefficient is quite low, which results in unsatisfactory rate performance.47 Therefore, increasing the electronic and ionic conductivities of TiNb2O7-related anodes to improve their electrochemical performance is still of great significance for the development of highly efficient Nb-based LIBs.
In the last decade, various micro/nanostructured TiNb2O7-related materials have been prepared via different synthetic and structural engineering strategies, to uncover their lithium storage behaviors and improve their electrochemical performances, including atomic level doping, carbon coating, pore structure modification, micro-nano modification and so on. Beyond LIBs, TiNb2O7 and its analogues (i.e., Ti2Nb10O29, TiNb6O17, TiNb24O62, and Ti2Nb2O9) have also been employed in other energy storage systems, such as sodium ion batteries (SIBs), hybrid supercapacitors (HSCs), and vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFBs). Through overviewing the recent advances, this Review aims to provide comprehensive understanding of the rational structural design of micro/nanostructured TiNb2O7 and its analogue anodes, as shown in the overview of the topic covered in this paper in Fig. 1. Furthermore, the synthesis strategy, unique structure, charge storage mechanisms, and electrochemical performance of micro/nanostructured TiNb2O7 and its analogues are discussed for applications in various energy storage devices (LIBs, SIBs, HSCs, and VRFBs). These efforts are important for the development of next-generation high-performance electrochemical energy storage systems. Finally, a comprehensive insight into the future research and challenges of developing micro/nanostructured TiNb2O7-related anodes for various efficient energy storage systems are highlighted.

2. Structure and lithium storage behaviors of the TiNb2O7 anode
TiNb2O7 belongs to monocline crystal systems, and its space group is C2/m with the lattice parameters of a = 20.35 Å, b = 3.80 Å, c = 11.88 Å, α = γ = 90°, and β = 120°19′. The structure can be described as a “3 × 3 sheared ReO3” structure consisting of TiO6 and NbO6 octahedrons sharing edges and corners (Fig. 2a and b).48–50 The disordered Nb atoms and Ti atoms occupy the centers of NbO6 and TiO6 octahedrons, respectively. The shear plane unit in the crystal structure is composed of 3 × 3 MO6 (M = Nb, Ti) octahedrons shared by the corners, and a large number of shear plane units are arranged along the b-axis to form the layer plane of TiNb2O7.51 Thus, lithium intercalation/deintercalation can occur in the space gap formed between shear planes, and the shear plane structure sharing the octahedral edges can increase the crystal structure stability and reduce the deformation upon intercalation/deintercalation, thus facilitating reversible lithium storage. Cava et al.52 first studied the lithium intercalation/deintercalation behaviors of TiNb2O7, proposing six cavities based on Nb-based oxides in the Wadsley–Roth phase, two of which (type IV and type V, shown in Fig. 2c) apply to the lithium storage. It was found that the electrochemical intercalation and deintercalation of lithium ions in TiNb2O7 rarely affect the structural stability, and the volume change is as small as 3.6%. Based on the above cavity theory, Saritha et al.53 prepared TiNb2O7 by a solid-state method and explained the lithium storage behavior. Each TiNb2O7 unit cell contains four type IV and four type V cavities, which allow reversible lithium intercalation/deintercalation, suggesting that each cavity in principle can accommodate more than two lithium ions, according to the crystallographically inequivalent oxygens in the structure and the metal–oxygen bond distances (Ti/Nb–O).54 The structural changes and the lattice parameters of TiNb2O7 upon lithium intercalation/deintercalation were revealed by the ex situ XRD analysis and are shown in Table 1, suggesting that TiNb2O7 transforms into Li4TiNb2O7 after full lithium intercalation, and the unit cell volume increases from 0.794 Å to 0.833 Å which further recovers to 0.794 Å after charging to 3 V, indicating that TiNb2O7 shows excellent stability and reversibility.

The lithium intercalation/deintercalation behaviors of a single TiNb2O7 particle were studied by Inada et al.,55 through developing a particle-current collector integrated microelectrode, in which the single particle (∼10 μm in size) was bonded on the tip of a tungsten microelectrode by platinum deposition (Fig. 2d–i). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurement revealed that the TiNb2O7 single particle showed reversible redox peaks at around 1.6–1.7 V vs. Li/Li+, and the higher anodic peak current than the cathodic one at a fixed scan rate suggested the faster reaction of Li+ extraction (i.e., discharge) than Li+ insertion (i.e., charge). Galvanostatic Intermittent Titration Technique (GITT) measurement confirmed that the chemical diffusion coefficient of Li+ during the delithiation process is much larger than that during the lithiation process at the equilibrium potential vs. Li/Li+ below 1.5 V. Notably, the capacity retention of the TiNb2O7 single particle was above 99% even after 2000 cycles at 10C, indicating its excellent intrinsic stability for lithium intercalation and deintercalation reactions.

In situ XRD analysis is a straightforward method to study the phase evolutions of TiNb2O7 upon lithium intercalation/deintercalation. Guo et al.56 proposed that the structural changes can be divided into two solid solution phase regions and one two-phase co-existence region in an intercalation–deintercalation cycle (Fig. 3). The two solid solution phases can be directly detected by the continuous diffraction peak shift, which both belong to the C2/m space system but with different lattice parameters. The lattice parameters of a, b, c, and β in the TiNb2O7 monoclinic unit cell were refined by the least-squares fitting of each x value in LixTiNb2O7. With the lithium intercalation or deintercalation, the changes of the lattice parameters and the unit cell volume were almost completely reversible. After the transformation from TiNb2O7 into Li3.6TiNb2O7, the cell volume change was 7.22%, far larger than that of Li4Ti5O12 whose deformation is less than 1%. Furthermore, Yu et al.57 also investigated the lithium storage mechanism in the TiNb2O7 anode and its structural changes upon lithiation/delithiation via in situ XRD analysis (Fig. 4). As shown in Fig. 4A, the representative reflections show an obvious shift to a low angle or display zig-zag migration during discharging, which move backward in the following charging and finally recover to the original positions with relative intensities at the end of charging, revealing the high reversibility of the electrochemical reaction and the lattice shrinking/enlarging upon cycling. Refined XRD analysis via the Rietveld method revealed that the whole volume expansion of TiNb2O7 is 6.85% after full lithiation. As illustrated in Fig. 4C, the lithium insertion pathway can be expressed as follows: (i) insertion of Li+ from the electrolyte into TiNb2O7 to form Li0.88TiNb2O7 (first solid-solution), (ii) Li0.88TiNb2O7 to Li2.67TiNb2O7 (two-phase coexistence), and (iii) evolution from Li2.67TiNb2O7 to the final fully lithiated Li4TiNb2O7 (final solid-solution).

The atomic and lattice structure evolutions of TiNb2O7 upon lithium intercalation and deintercalation were further investigated using a spherical aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM). Lu et al.58 depicted the lattice positions occupied by Li, Ti, Nb and O atoms at the atomic scale in different states and proposed possible lithiation/delithiation processes and reaction mechanisms (Fig. 4D1–D4). The storage locations of lithium ions and oxygen atoms were observed by dark-field HADDF and bright-field ABF analyses. Combined with first-principles simulation, it was found that the inserted lithium ions were stored in the (001) planes of TiNb2O7. As shown in Fig. 4D1–D3, the crystal structure expanded by 9.2% after intercalation of 4 lithium ions, and the interplanar spacing of the (001) plane increased from the original 1.03 nm to 1.15 nm. After deintercalation, the interplanar spacing decreased to 1.08 nm, which is inconsistent with the initial value. It is apparent that lithium ion insertion caused the lattice structure deformation and thus resulting electronic structure changes were also described based on the first principles calculations. The DOS diagram of TiNb2O7 in different lithium intercalation states revealed that the electric conductivity of the LixTiNb2O7 electrode is significantly improved with increasing the intercalation amount of lithium ions.
It is generally believed that the formation of a solid electrolyte interface (SEI) film could be avoided at a high operating voltage above 1.0 V. However, Wu et al.59 found the formation of SEI layers on the TiNb2O7 anode and comprehensively investigated the interface evolution mechanism and the influence on TiNb2O7-based full batteries. The results showed that a thin SEI layer is formed during the initial lithium insertion process despite its operating voltage being above 1.0 V, which is partially dissolved during the following lithium extraction process. The SEI layer is mainly composed of Li2CO3, ROLi, ROCOOLi, and LiF, which was formed on the surface region between TiNb2O7 and the electrolyte in the voltage range of 1.0–3.0 V. The SEI layer increased gradually with long-term cycling, even though the formation/dissolution of the SEI occurred repeatedly. Importantly, the gassing behavior in the TiNb2O7/LiFePO4 pouch cell was obviously observed for the first time, and the addition of VC in the electrolyte can effectively suppress the swelling phenomenon of full batteries.
The lithium intercalation/deintercalation behaviors of TiNb2O7 in a wide potential range of 0.6–3.0 V were studied, and Ise et al.60 found that additional lithium storage occurred between 0.9 and 0.75 V, as revealed by ex situ X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) analysis. The simultaneous peak shift in Ti K-edge and Nb K-edge XANES (X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy) spectra demonstrated the charge compensation by an increase of Li+ ion amounts in TiNb2O7 for x > 4.0. The volume expansion ΔV of nano-TiNb2O7 (8.5%) was smaller than that of the as-prepared micro-TiNb2O7 (10.5%) at x = 4.0, and the difference was suggested to be caused by a difference of domain arrangement in TiNb2O7 crystal structures. GITT measurement revealed that the lithium diffusion coefficient (D) in nano-TiNb2O7 for x > 3.5 was one order of magnitude higher than that of micro-TiNb2O7, and the reversible capacity of nano-TiNb2O7 was 365.7 mA h g−1 (x = 4.72), corresponding to 94.3% of the theoretical capacity. The additional lithium storage in nano-TiNb2O7 was attributed to the enhancement of lithium diffusivity in highly crystallized primary particles with a short lithium diffusion length, as compared with the larger micro-TiNb2O7. It's expected that highly crystallized TiNb2O7 nanoparticles with a single-crystal structure and uniform facet orientation are promising as high-capacity anode materials with fast-charging and long-life performance. Besides the lithium intercalation/deintercalation mechanism, the pseudocapacitive behavior also contributes to additional lithium storage capacity in TiNb2O7-related electrodes, especially when the particles of the electrode materials decrease to the nanoscale with large exposed surface areas.61–65
3. Structure engineering of TiNb2O7 based anodes and their lithium storage properties
It's well documented that the electrochemical properties of electrode materials largely depend on their structural characteristics, owing to the structure-dependent physicochemical properties, while synthetic strategies are extremely important for the desired construction of various micro/nanostructures with a controlled size, shape, phase, and composition. Herein, we correlated the syntheses of various nanostructured TiNb2O7 anodes with their lithium storage performances, aiming to provide a comprehensive and rational understanding of how to design advanced TiNb2O7 anodes for high-performance LIBs and other energy storage systems. Table 2 summarizes the preparation methods and electrochemical performances of various micro/nanostructured TiNb2O7 anodes, which were classified according to the dimensional shapes.

3.1. Particulate TiNb2O7
Particulate materials with an undefined size/shape have broad prospects for large-scale production due to the simple preparation, low cost, and easy large-scale synthesis. However, particles with a wide size distribution usually show a weak promotion effect on lithium ion diffusion and charge transfer, which to some extent limits their electrochemical performances when applied as electrodes for LIBs, as compared with the well-defined materials with a uniform size and shape. To overcome these drawbacks, various strategies (i.e., nanocrystallization, elemental doping, carbon coating, etc.) have been developed to enhance the electrochemical performance of irregularly shaped particulate TiNb2O7. As a traditional and straightforward synthetic method, the solid-state reaction has been widely adopted to synthesize particulate TiNb2O7, which has the advantages of convenient operation, a simple process, and low cost. Besides, it can avoid or reduce hard agglomeration which easily occurs in the liquid phase. However, the disadvantages of uneven components, multi-agglomerated particles, and wide particle size are still present. Importantly, at the early stage, the highly crystalline TiNb2O7 particles obtained by solid-state synthesis at a high annealing temperature served as an ideal platform for the study of the lithium storage behavior and mechanism.
As a cost-effective and easy-to-handle method, solid-state synthesis appears as the most suitable way for the large-scale production of TiNb2O7. So far, the reaction kinetics and the thermodynamic properties of Ti–Nb–O systems have been intensively studied, and three stable titanium niobates, namely TiNb2O7, Ti2Nb10O29, and TiNb24O62, have been reported in the literature.90 Choi et al.90 investigated the activation energy and the reaction kinetics of the TiNb2O7 phase, which was synthesized by a solid-phase reaction using TiO2 and Nb2O5 with a stoichiometric molar ratio of 1:1 as the starting materials, and studied the evolutions of the product phase, morphology and particle size distribution at different annealing temperatures (800, 1000, 1200, and 1400 °C) and holding time (1, 10, 15, and 20 h). XRD analysis revealed that Nb-rich phases tend to appear first, following the stoichiometric complex oxide formation pathway TiNb24O62 → Ti2Nb10O29 → TiNb2O7. Quantitative phase analysis by the Rietveld refinement method showed that the optimum temperature and retention time are 1200 °C and 20 h in the current study with a phase ratio of TiNb2O7 up to 90 at%. In other reports, Jat et al.91 have synthesized TiNb2O7 by heat treatment at 1000 °C for 48 h in their studies and Reich et al.92 also prepared TiNb2O7 by a standard solid-state reaction at 1250 °C for 48 h in air.
Particles with size ranging from micro- to nano-scales have been synthesized and studied as anode materials for LIBs. Inada et al.55 prepared microsized TiNb2O7 with a size of around 10 μm by a conventional solid-phase reaction using anatase TiO2 and Nb2O5 as reactants, which were mixed by planetary ball milling and then annealed at 1300 °C for 24 hours. The single TiNb2O7 particle microelectrode delivered a capacity of around 250 mA h g−1 and approximately 3.2 Li+ can be reversibly inserted/extracted, with a capacity retention of 98.4% after 125 cycles at 1C. Wu et al.59 synthesized TiNb2O7 nanoparticles by a simple solid-phase method using equimolar TiO2 and Nb2O5 as precursors, annealing at 1000 °C for 24 h under air atmosphere followed by grinding and sieving processes. The TiNb2O7 nanoparticle electrode delivered a higher reversible capacity of 256 mA h g−1 and an initial coulombic efficiency of 80.1% at a current density of 0.1C, but the reversible capacity remains 173.4 mA h g−1 after 200 cycles with a capacity retention of 68.4%. The results suggest that higher utilization of TiNb2O7 by decreasing the particle size would bring higher reversible capacity but could lead to an inferior cycle performance because of larger volume changes. Lu et al.58 also prepared TiNb2O7 particles by the solid-phase reaction. The precursor formed by ball milling equimolar TiO2 and Nb2O5 was dried under vacuum and calcined at a high temperature of 1350 °C to form TiNb2O7 particles, which delivered discharge/charge capacities of 281/261 mA h g−1 and an initial coulombic efficiency of 93% at a current density of 30 mA g−1 in the voltage range of 0.8–3.0 V, and the reversible capacity can be maintained at 250 mA h g−1 with 96% capacity retention after 20 cycles. Note that these TiNb2O7 particle anodes are far from satisfactory with respect to reversible capacity and cycle life, and further modification is needed.
The intrinsic low electron conductivity and low lithium ion diffusion rate of TiNb2O7 are serious obstacles that hinder its practical application in high-capacity high-power energy storage, which can be solved by the introduction of oxygen vacancies, conductive layer coating, and doping modification. Inada et al.66 prepared two differently colored TiNb2O7 nanoparticles with the same crystal structure, size, and morphology (Fig. 5a1–d), via the conventional solid-state reaction between TiO2 and Nb2O5, which were annealing at 1050 °C for 24 h in air and a vacuum, respectively. Consequently, the color of vacuum annealed TiNb2O7 (TNO-V) was dark blue and the air-annealed one (TNO-A) was white, and the vacuum annealing led to the partial reduction of Ti4+ and Nb5+ in TNO-V to Ti3+ and Nb4+ due to the introduction of oxygen vacancies, which greatly improved the electron conductivity of TNO-V (10−3 S cm−1) as compared with TNO-A (10−11 S cm−1). The initial reversible capacities of the TNO-A and TNO-V electrodes were both in the range of 260–270 mA h g−1 at a low current density of 0.5 mA cm−2, but when the current density exceeded 2 mA cm−2, TNO-V showed smaller polarization and larger capacity than TNO-A. When the maximum current density was 5.0 mA cm−2, TNO-V maintained a discharge capacity of 140 mA h g−1, while the capacity of TNO-A was limited to 80 mA h g−1. The significant improvement of the rate performance of TNO-V was mainly attributed to the enhancement of intrinsic electronic conductivity by introducing oxygen vacancies into the TNO lattice. Besides, the capacity retentions after 50 cycles for both TNO-A and TNO-V electrodes were around 90% with the coulombic efficiencies of nearly 100% during the whole cycle, suggesting that the intrinsic electronic conductivity had no notable influence on the cycling performance of TNO, and the cycling performance of the active material was influenced by not only the intrinsic conductivity but also the magnitude of the volume change during the electrochemical reaction.

Liu et al.68 loaded Ag nanoparticles to enhance the conductivity and electrochemical performance of TiNb2O7 particles (Fig. 5e–g), which were prepared by milling equimolar TiO2 and Nb2O5 and then calcining at 1100 °C for 24 h under air atmosphere. Ag nanoparticles were loaded onto TiNb2O7 particles by the solvothermal method. Consequently, the Ag/TiNb2O7 composite electrode delivered a highest reversible capacity of 273.5 mA h g−1 and maintained 252.5 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles with a capacity retention of 92.3%, which was much better than that for pure TiNb2O7, as the introduction of Ag nanoparticles efficiently increased the electron conductivity of the Ag/TiNb2O7 electrode and improved the electron transport in the Li+ insertion/extraction reaction.
Doping of exotic elements was also demonstrated to enhance the intrinsic electron conductivity and promote the Li+ diffusion in the crystal lattice by changing the electron distribution of TiNb2O7, which thus effectively enhances the electrochemical performance. Song et al.70 prepared Mo-doped TiNb2O7 by a conventional sol–gel method. The precursors of Ti(OC4H9)4 and Nb(OC2H5)5 (with a 0.95:2 molar ratio) dissolved in alcohol–acetic acid was dried to obtain a gel powder, which was then mixed with a Mo source (MoO3) by ball-milling, followed by calcination at 1000 °C to obtain Mo-doped TiNb2O7 particles (Fig. 5h–j). As revealed by the projected density of states calculations, Mo6+ doping resulted in the redistribution of charge in TiNb2O7, enhancing the electron densities near Ti, Nb, and O atoms, which facilitated the diffusion of lithium ions in the lattice and increased the electron conductivity of TiNb2O7. Notably, Mo–TiNb2O7 showed excellent high-rate performance, delivering a high discharge capacity of 184 mA h g−1 at 100C.
Decreasing the particle size to the nanoscale can shorten the lithium diffusion pathway and thus enhance the electrochemical properties, and solution-based methods such as the sol–gel method and solvo/hydrothermal methods have been widely applied to synthesize TiNb2O7 nanoparticles. Ise et al.60 hydrothermally synthesized TiNb2O7 (H-TNO, 9.4 m2 g−1) nanoparticles and investigated their lithium storage behaviors as compared with solid-state synthesized TiNb2O7 (S-TNO, 4.0 m2 g−1) particles in a wider voltage range of 0.6–3.0 V (Fig. 6a–c). For the hydrothermal synthesis of H-TNO, a mixture of niobium chloride (NbCl5) dissolved in ethanol and titanium oxysulfate (TiOSO4) dissolved in dilute sulfuric acid was hydrothermally treated and freeze-dried to form an amorphous nano-sized precursor, followed by calcining at 1000 °C for 30 min. In contrast, S-TNO particles were prepared by a solid-state reaction of premixed anatase TiO2 and niobium pentahydroxide (Nb(OH)5), heating at 1100 °C for 12 h. The structural analysis revealed that the H-TNO nanoparticles with the particle size range of 50–300 nm showed a highly crystallized single-crystal-like structure with a uniform face orientation, while electrochemical analysis revealed the additional insertion/extraction of lithium between 0.9 and 0.75 V, forming LixTiNb2O7 with x > 4.0 and yielding a highly reversible capacity of 341 mA h g−1 corresponding to x = 4.40 and a volumetric capacity of 1480 mA h cm−3 (higher than that (837 mA h cm−3) of graphite), better than that of S-TNO. Fei et al.69 prepared TNO nanoparticles with a smaller particle size of around 10 nm and a large BET surface area of 79.5 m2 g−1, by a hydrothermal method using SBA-15 as a confined template (Fig. 6d–g). In the synthesis, a mixed solution containing NbCl5 and titanium(IV) isopropoxide (Ti/Nb molar ratio of 1/2) was injected into porous SBA-15 and then heated at 1000 °C for 5 h in air. However, the TNO electrode delivered relatively low initial discharge/charge capacities of 213/210 mA h g−1 at 1C and only maintained 175 mA h g−1 after 300 cycles at 1C. Besides, the capacities were only 130 mA h g−1 and 76 mA h g−1 at 5C and 10C, respectively, displaying a poor rate capability. As an explanation, a smaller crystal size can effectively increase the electrode/electrolyte contact and reduce the Li diffusion path, but the considerable interfacial contacts and grain boundaries may lower the electron transfer efficiency, thus resulting in the poor rate and cycle performance of an electrode.

Introducing carbon-based materials is an effective strategy to enhance the electrode conductivity as well as the electrochemical performance. Lin et al.71 prepared a TiNb2O7/CNT composite by annealing a mixture of titanium isopropoxide (Ti(OC3H7)4), niobium chloride (NbCl5) and pretreated carbon nanotubes (CNTs), at 700 °C in an N2 atmosphere (Fig. 6h and i). The nano-TiNb2O7 crystallites with a size of 20–200 nm showed good contact with CNTs, and the annealing in argon resulted in the generation of oxygen vacancies and low-valent cations (Ti3+ and Nb4+ ions), which can also improve the lithium ion diffusion rate and electron conductivity. Consequently, the nano-TiNb2O7/CNT composite exhibited reversible capacities of 346 mA h g−1 at 0.1C, and 223 and 163 mA h g−1 at a high rate of 10C and 30C, respectively. Notably, a high capacity of 218 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at 10C was retained, corresponding to a small capacity loss of only 2.4%. Shen et al.40 reported the construction of TiNb2O7 nanoparticle decorated vertical graphene (VG) nanoarrays on carbon cloth, in which the TiNb2O7 nanoparticles were protected by S-doped carbon (S–C) shells, forming a binder-free VG/TiNb2O7@S–C electrode (Fig. 6j–q). The electrode demonstrated large porosity, improved conductivity, and enhanced structural stability. Consequently, the VG/TiNb2O7@S–C electrodes showed a high capacity from 284 to 354 mA h g−1 at 1C, and 181 to 241 mA h g−1 at 160C as the working temperature increased from 25 to 70 °C. Additionally, a remarkable high-temperature (70 °C) cycling span was demonstrated for the VG/TiNb2O7@S–C electrode, which displayed a capacity of 203 mA h g−1 at 40C after 5000 cycles. The enhancement of high-power capability was attributed to the positively synergistic effect from the VG support and the S–C shell protection. Notably, the full cell (VG/TiNb2O7@S–C//LFP) can deliver a capacity of 280 mA h g−1 at 1C and 241 mA h g−1 at 10C, respectively.
The full cell behaviors of TiNb2O7 particles were also investigated to demonstrate their efficacy. Han et al.43 prepared TiNb2O7 particles by a sol–gel method, annealing the Ti/Nb precursor at a high temperature of 900–1300 °C, and the carbon layer was coated on the surface of the product with sucrose solution as a carbon source. The carbon-coated TiNb2O7 (C–TNO) anode combined with a LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 (LNMO) anode was assembled into a full-cell system, which was used to study the effect of the C–TNO anode and LNMO cathode on battery capacity. The LNMO-limited full cells showed a loss of charge capacity in the initial cycle, which gradually decreased with increasing the cycle number. The capacity decay was attributed to the overcharge reaction at 3.3 V. Although the C–TNO-limited full cells had a charge capacity loss in the initial cycle, they can maintain a good charge capacity after further cycling. No substantial capacity loss can be observed after 50 cycles, and no overcharge reaction occurred on the cathode, suggesting that the anode-limited full cell exhibited a better cycling performance than cathode-limited full cells. Therefore, it's worth noting that improper matching of the anode and cathode will cause side reactions between the cathode material and the electrolyte, consume lithium ions inside the battery and reduce the cycle stability of the battery.
3.2. Spherical TiNb2O7
Nanostructured materials with a spherical morphology usually possess low surface energy, high volume density, high fluidity characteristics, and a large specific surface area, which are beneficial for sufficient contact between the active electrode and the electrolyte. Especially, hierarchical nano/mesoporous TiNb2O7 spheres with interconnected nanoparticles and pores merge the merits of the conventional nanostructured electrode and also produce new advantageous characteristics. The hierarchical multiscale porosity with interconnected channels permits the easy penetration of the electrolyte into the inner active materials, facilitating fast charge transfer while reducing the length of lithium ion diffusion paths. Besides, the spherical morphology with structural isotropy and porosity can efficiently relieve the inevitable volume changes during lithiation/delithiation processes.
Porous nanomaterials can usually be prepared by the sacrificial template method. Cheng et al.72 prepared porous TiNb2O7 nanospheres composed of nanoparticles with the assistance of block copolymer P123 (EO20PO70EO20) as a template via a solvothermal route (Fig. 7a–f). The porous TiNb2O7 nanospheres showed an average diameter of 500 nm, exhibiting a BET surface area of 23.4 m2 g−1 and a pore volume of 0.155 cm3 g−1. When examined as an anode for LIBs, the TiNb2O7 nanospheres displayed superior rate performance and cycle stability as compared with the counterpart obtained without P123, delivering a reversible capacity of 167 mA h g−1 at 5C. Notably, the capacity remained at 160 mA h g−1 with a capacity loss of only 0.0033% even after 10000 cycles, and the TiNb2O7 electrode still well maintained the nanosphere morphology and the porous structure, indicating that the porous TiNb2O7 nanospheres demonstrated great potential as anode materials for long-life and high-power LIBs.

Instead of using templates to produce porosity, Li et al.75 reported the large-scale one-step solvothermal synthesis of hierarchical TiNb2O7 microspheres without the use of any surfactant assistance, and such microspheres with micro/nano-scale composite structures were self-assembled from well-crystalline TiNb2O7 nanoparticles, forming a 3D nanoporous structure (Fig. 7j and k), displaying a specific surface area of 25.26 m2 g−1 and a pore size distribution ranging from 2–48 nm. The hierarchical TiNb2O7 electrode exhibited high rate capacities and long cyclability, delivering a high capacity of 258 mA h g−1 at 1C, 175 mA h g−1 at 5C, and even 115.2 mA h g−1 at 10C after 500 cycles. Liu et al.73 also synthesized mesoporous TiNb2O7 (m-TNO) microspheres through a solvothermal method. During the subsequent calcination process, Ti–Nb precursor spheres underwent crystallization forming TiNb2O7 nanocrystallites, and simultaneous decomposition forming many mesopores via gas releasing (Fig. 7i–n). The as-prepared TiNb2O7 spheres with diameters of 0.6–0.9 μm were composed of nanocrystallites with a size of around 17 nm, and displayed a BET surface area of 22.22 m2 g−1 with a pore volume of 0.108 m3 g−1 and pore size of 10–35 nm. Owing to the reduced charge transfer distances and the porous structure, the m-TNO electrode exhibited a high specific capacity of 319 mA h g−1 in the first cycle at 0.1C with a 93.5% coulombic efficiency, and showed a high capacity retention of 83% (155 mA h g−1, capacity fading of 0.03% per cycle) after 500 cycles at 10C. To explore the reasons for the elevated rate capacity and long cycle life, solid TiNb2O7 microparticles were also prepared by a solid-state reaction. Through comparison, the mesoporous TiNb2O7 (m-TNO) microspheres showed more proportion of capacitive capacity, smaller charge transfer resistance and faster Li+ diffusion.
Nanostructuring can shorten the pathway for Li+ diffusion and facilitate the fast electron transport to some extent, but may be far from satisfactory when preparing a thick electrode in real industrial applications. To increase the electronic conductivity of TiNb2O7, a strategy of partial nitridation forming conductive Ti1−xNbxN layers on the surface region was also proposed and conducted by ammonia treatment at high temperature under an inert atmosphere. Park et al.74 synthesized porous TiNb2O7 microspheres (PTNO MSs) by a simple solvothermal reaction, and the as-obtained PTNO MSs with a particle size of ∼1.2 μm and controllable pore sizes in the range of 5–35 nm can be realized by changing the concentration of DETA in the precursor solution (Fig. 8). After performing the nitridation treatment of the as-prepared PTNO MSs at 700 °C for 10 min, the nitridated PTNO (NPTNO) MSs showed a high discharge capacity of ∼265 mA h g−1, remarkable rate capability (∼143 mA h g−1 at 100C) and durable long-term cyclability (190 mA h g−1, ∼91% capacity retention over 1000 cycles at 5C), which is higher than that of the PTNO MS counterpart (80%, 182 mA h g−1), suggesting that the porous structure and conducting Ti1−xNbxN layer enhanced the transport kinetics associated with Li+ ions and electrons.

To further increase the electrode conductivity, hybridizing TiNb2O7 with conductive carbon-based materials is highly desired. Zhu et al.77 synthesized hollow TiNb2O7@C spheres (denoted as HTNO@C) for the first time via a solvothermal method, using carbon spheres as a sacrificial template, while the carbon layers were uniformly coated on the surface of TiNb2O7 spheres through carbonization of the coated dopamine layers (Fig. 9a–e). The carbon coating greatly improved the conductivity of hollow TiNb2O7 spheres and conspicuously suppressed the particle aggregation. As a result, the HTNO@C and HTNO spheres showed initial charge/discharge capacities of 316.7/319.4 and 305.9/311.3 mA h g−1 at 0.25C, respectively, which can be correspondingly maintained at 282.6/283.8 and 250.8/252.3 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles, indicating the great enhancement of the electrochemical performance by the carbon coating. Even at a high rate of 10C, the HTNO@C spheres exhibited much higher discharge capacities of 157.9 than the HTNO counterpart (99.1 mA h g−1). The excellent cycle performance and rate capability of HTNO@C spheres were due to the distinctive hollow structure which effectively relieved the volume expansion upon lithiation/delithiation and the uniformly coated carbon layers which enhanced the charge transfer rate. Yoon et al.78 prepared dual-phase carbon-coated Nb2O5/TiNb2O7 porous spheres by a solvothermal reaction without the use of any surfactant assistance, and the carbon coating was performed by hydrothermal carbonization of glucose and annealing under an inert atmosphere (Fig. 9f–j). Nb2O5/TiNb2O7 displayed 3D interconnected microsphere architectures with a homogeneous carbon coating, showing a BET specific surface area of 34.5 m2 g−1 and a total pore volume of 0.179 cm3 g−1. The thickness and content can be controlled by adjusting the amount of glucose, and the optimized carbon-coated Nb2O5/TiNb2O7 with ∼2.5 wt% carbon showed high discharge/charge capacities of 311/274 mA h g−1, which can be maintained at 247 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at C/10. Even at a high rate of 5 and 10C, the capacity retention rates of the carbon-coated Nb2O5/TiNb2O7 porous spheres are 222 and 168 mA h g−1, respectively.

The spray-drying technique, a simple, large-scale production, and inexpensive method, has been widely used in the syntheses of spherical materials (i.e., Li4Ti5O12/C,93 LiFePO4·Li3V2(PO4)3/C,94 NiO,95etc.). Zhu et al.96 for the first time prepared nanoporous TNO/C composite microspheres with a 3D conductive carbon network by a facile spray-drying method (Fig. 10a–c). Microspheres with diameters of 2–10 μm were constructed from small nanoparticles (100–200 nm in size), showing a specific surface area of 11.2 m2 g−1 and an average pore size of 50 nm, which can accelerate the permeation of the electrolyte into the inner surface of electrode materials. Meanwhile, the 3D conductive carbon network greatly improves the electrical conductivity of the electrode. Such TNO/C microspheres demonstrated a prominent charge/discharge capacity of 323.2/326 mA h g−1 after 300 cycles at 0.25C and 259.9/262.5 mA h g−1 after 1000 cycles at 5C. Furthermore, Takami et al.67 synthesized monoclinic TiNb2O7 primary particles by annealing ball-milled anatase TiO2 and Nb(OH)5 at 1100 °C for 12 h. Afterwards, micro-sized spherical TNO secondary particles with a size range of 5–20 μm were prepared by annealing a spray-dried aqueous mixture of primary TiNb2O7 particles and disaccharide, at 700 °C in an Ar atmosphere for carbonization (Fig. 10d and e). The as-prepared carbon-coated micro-sized spherical TiNb2O7 secondary particles with 2 wt% carbon coating were applied in full cells with LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 (NCM) as the cathode, delivering a high capacity of 49 Ah. When used in automotive applications such as EVs and PHEVs, the TNO/NCM battery displayed combined advantages of high energy density, fast charging and discharging rates and long cycle life, exhibiting a high energy-density of 350 W h L−1, a high input-power density of 10 kW L−1 for 10 s at 50% SOC and fast-charge performance from 0% to 90% SOC in less than 6 min at a 10C rate. High rate discharge tests indicated a high capacity retention of 93% at a 10C rate. The capacity retention after 7000 cycles was 86% after full charge/discharge cycling at a 1C rate. The cycle life was predicted to be 14000 cycles at 80% capacity retention, indicating excellent cycle-life performance, as compared with the LTO/NCM counterpart.

In addition, the introduction of exotic nanostructured carbon-based materials such as graphene and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) is also a good choice to increase electrode conductivity. For example, Noh et al.76 prepared TiNb2O7 (TNO) microspheres, composed of nano-scaled primary particles, via a solvothermal reaction. The presence of formic acid, which acted as an acid catalyst, and bidentate ligands facilitated the controlled agglomeration of primary particles into secondary particles. Furthermore, reduced graphene oxide wrapped TNO (rGO-wrapped TNO) microspheres were prepared using CTAB as a surfactant to adsorb the GO layer, followed by heating in a reducing atmosphere (Fig. 10f–j). The as-prepared rGO-wrapped TNO exhibited superior rate capabilities and cyclability, delivering 117 mA h g−1 capacity at 50C and ∼120 mA h g−1 even after 500 cycles at 5C. Electrochemical evaluations demonstrated that rGO wrapping effectively improved the electronic conductivity and lithium ion diffusivity of TNO microspheres. As another commercialized carbon nanomaterial, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been widely used as an ideal conductive additive because of their unique 1D tubular structure, high electronic conductivity, and large surface area. The incorporation of CNTs can serve as the conductive substrate of TNO and as the buffer matrices to accommodate its volume expansion, which can enhance the cycle and rate capability of TNO.62,71
3.3. One-dimensional TiNb2O7
One-dimensional (1D) nanostructures including nanowires, nanorods, nanotubes, and nanofibers have received considerable attention owing to their unique physicochemical properties, such as a high surface to volume ratio, facile strain relaxation and suppressed self-aggregation. Traditional TiNb2O7 was prepared by a solid-state method, which generally required high-temperature annealing, thus resulting in a large particle size with a low surface area, which usually led to unsatisfactory electrochemical performance. Therefore, various strategies have been developed to fabricate TiNb2O7 nanostructures to overcome these drawbacks. Among these methods (i.e., solvo/hydrothermal method and sol–gel method), electrospinning is a straightforward, inexpensive, simple and versatile route to prepare 1D nanofibers with various unique structures. Up to now, various electrospun TiNb2O7 nanofibers with porous, solid or hollow structures have been reported and demonstrated greatly improved capacity and cyclability, owing to the decreased Li+ diffusion path, the alleviated strain relaxation, and the large number of surface active sites.
Tang et al. reported the first electrospinning synthesis of TiNb2O7 nanofibers using a solution composed of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and niobium ethoxide and tetrabutyl orthotitanate as a precursor (Fig. 11a–c).81 The as-prepared TiNb2O7 nanofibers were composed of interconnected nanoparticles with sizes ranging from 50 to 200 nm, which delivered a reversible capacity of 250 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles at 1C with a capacity retention of 92%. Aravindan et al. also fabricated electrospun TiNb2O7 nanofibers using PVP/titanium(IV) butoxide/niobium ethoxide as a precursor, which delivered a reversible capacity of ∼200 mA h g−1 after 250 cycles at a current density of 400 mA g−1, with a capacity retention of 91% (Fig. 11d–f).79 Furthermore, the electrospun TiNb2O7 nanofibers as an anode were introduced into full-cell batteries, using electrospun LiMn2O4 nanofibers as the cathode. Electrospun polyvinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene (PVdF-HFP) nanofibers gelled with 1 M LiPF6 in an ethylene carbonate (EC)/dimethyl carbonate (DMC) mixture were used as the separator-cum-electrolyte, exhibiting a liquid-like conductivity of ∼2.9 mS cm−1 under ambient conditions (Fig. 11g–k). In half-cells, TiNb2O7 delivered a discharge capacity of ∼271 mA h g−1 at 150 mA g−1 with a capacity retention of ∼82% after 100 cycles, while electrospun LiMn2O4 exhibited a reversible capacity of ∼118 mA h g−1 at the same current density. In the balanced full-cell tested in the voltage range of 1.95–2.75 V, LiMn2O4|gelled PVdF-HFP|TiNb2O7 delivered a reversible capacity of ∼116 mA h g−1 at 150 mA g−1 with an operating potential and energy density of ∼2.4 V and ∼278 W h kg−1 (based on the cathode active mass). This work demonstrated that the electrospinning technique could be a new platform to realize the advantages of 1D nanostructured materials in practical LIBs.80

To increase the electronic conductivity and lithium diffusivity of the TiNb2O7 anode, Park et al. synthesized TiNb2O7 nanofibers by electrospinning and subsequently annealing in air, which was further annealed in Ar–NH3 gas, thus resulting in the formation of conductive Ti1−xNbxN bumps (Fig. 12).41 The as-prepared nanofibers with an average diameter of ∼110 nm were composed of TiNb2O7 crystallites with a size of ∼70 nm and pores in the range of 0–40 nm, which thus shortened the pathways for Li+ intercalation and facilitated the electrolyte diffusion into the host material. Besides, the conductive Ti1−xNbxN bumps with a particle size of ∼5 nm formed on the surface greatly enhanced the electrode conductivity. As a consequence, the porous heterogeneous hybrid TiNb2O7/Ti1−xNbxN nanofibers delivered an initial discharge capacity of ∼254 mA h g−1 at 1C and a reversible capacity of 174 mA h g−1 at 5C after 500 cycles with a capacity retention of 76.1%. Furthermore, Wang et al. demonstrated that carbon coating on electrospun TiNb2O7 nanofibers can enhance the lithium storage performance, and carbon-coated TiNb2O7 (denoted as TNO@C) nanofibers were easily obtained by annealing TiNb2O7/glucose in an inert atmosphere.97 Apparently, the TNO@C electrode delivered a reversible capacity of 195 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at 0.5 A g−1 with about 80% capacity retention, which was much higher than that of the pure TNO electrode (112.4 mA h g−1 with 67.5% capacity retention). This work demonstrated that nitridation via annealing in ammonia gas or carbon coating is an efficient route to enhance the electric conductivity of electrode materials.

Instead of solid fibers, tubular fibers have also been developed via electrospinning. Park et al. successfully constructed hierarchical porous TiNb2O7 nanotubes (denoted as TNO NTs) via dual-nozzle electrospinning and subsequent annealing, using heavy mineral oil as a hard template (Fig. 13a–g).83 The effects of synthetic parameters such as the molar concentrations/ratio and calcination temperatures on the crystallinity, particle size, wall thickness and porosity of the as-prepared TiNb2O7 nanotubes were investigated. The optimized TNO NTs displayed an outer diameter of ∼260 nm and a wall thickness of ∼30 nm, consisting of interconnected nanoparticles and micro/meso-pores with sizes ranging from 1 to 70 nm in the shells. The TNO NT electrode showed discharge capacities of ∼294 mA h g−1 at 0.1C and stable capacity of 210 mA h g−1 over 700 cycles at 1C, and a remarkably large discharge capacity of 230 mA h g−1 at an even higher current density of 50C. In addition, Yu et al. also reported the successful preparation of TiNb2O7 hollow nanofibers via one-step dual-nozzle coaxial coelectrospinning followed by calcination (Fig. 13h–o).57 Differently, poly(acrylonitrile) dissolved in DMF as inner sol was used as a hard template, which completely decomposed after annealing in air. The as-electrospun TiNb2O7 hollow nanofibers exhibited a reversible capacity of 210.1 mA h g−1 after 150 cycles at 0.4C and 158.4 mA h g−1 after 900 cycles at a high rate of 10C with a capacity retention of 80.6%. Apparently, both the as-prepared hollow TiNb2O7 nanofibers/nanotubes demonstrated superior cycle stability and rate capability when examined as anode materials for LIBs, and the excellent electrochemical performance was attributed to the novel 1D structure composed of interconnected nanocrystallites. The hierarchical porous tubular structure provided increased surface active sites and fast Li+ diffusivity. It's worth noting that both hollow TiNb2O7 nanofibers/nanotubes still well preserved the original morphologies even after long-term high-rate cycling, suggesting the robustness of their tubular structures upon lithiation/delithiation. Moreover, these design strategies can be generally extended for the syntheses of various porous metal oxides with controlled porosity for energy storage and conversion applications.

By virtue of the small volume change of the TiNb2O7 anode upon lithiation/delithiation and thus the resultant excellent cycling stability and rate capability, hierarchical hetero-nanostructures were developed, using TiNb2O7 as a backbone to combine with other high capacity anode materials, e.g., MoS2, which exhibited high lithium storage capacity because of the weak van der Waals interaction along the [002] direction, enabling easy Li+ intercalation. Pham-Cong et al. designed a hierarchical hetero-nanostructure using electrospun TiNb2O7 nanofibers as backbones which were grown with ultrathin MoS2 nanosheets (denoted as TNO@MS HRs) via simple electrospinning and hydrothermal processes (Fig. 14).82 The TNO@MS HRs with an entangled structure efficiently facilitated the ionic and electronic diffusion, showing a positive synergetic enhancement of lithium storage performance. The TNO@MS HR-based LIBs exhibited high capacities of 872 and 740 mA h g−1 after 42 and 200 cycles at 1 A g−1, respectively, and an excellent rate performance of 611 mA h g−1 at 4 A g−1 in the potential range of 0.001–3 V. The current work provided a novel strategy to develop advanced electrode materials with high specific capacity and cycling stability.

Except for the electrospinning method, Lou et al. reported the synthesis of 1D single-crystalline TiNb2O7 nanorods with the growth direction along the (003) plane (Fig. 15a–d), via a simple solution-based process and subsequent thermal annealing, using Nb2O5/tetrabutyltitanate as Nb/Ti starting precursors, and HF, ammonium hydroxide and oxalic acid as controlling agents.86 TiNb2O7 nanorods with diameters of 100–300 nm and lengths of 300–600 nm were obtained by annealing Nb/Ti precursors at 900 °C in air, which exhibited superior electrochemical performance, displaying a high reversible capacity of 264.6 mA h g−1 at 0.1C and 140.4/83.9 mA h g−1 at 20/50C, respectively. For a long-term cycling test, a capacity of 123.2 mA h g−1 can be maintained at 10C after 500 cycles. In contrast, Hu et al. also reported the fabrication of TiNb2O7 nanorods via a solution-based process and subsequent thermal annealing (Fig. 15e–h), but using NbCl5/titanium(IV) isopropoxide as Nb/Ti starting precursors, and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), glacial acetic acid and HCl as controlling agents.87 The resultant white Nb/Ti precursor was calcined at 700 °C for 2 h in air. The TiNb2O7 nanorods with an average diameter of 100 nm and an average length of 300 nm delivered reversible capacities of 248, 233, 214, 182, 154 and 122 mA h g−1 at 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10 and 20C, respectively, and 140 mA h g−1 with a capacity retention of 91.0% after 100 cycles at 10C. Furthermore, Li et al. synthesized TiNb2O7 nanowires composed of aggregated nanoparticles (size of ∼35 nm) via a facile sol–gel method combined with the subsequent calcination process (Fig. 15i–l), using pre-obtained sulfonated poly (DVB-co-VBC) nanotubes as the directing agent, and tetrabutyl titanate/NbCl5 in ethanol as Nb/Ti precursors.85 After calcining in air at 800 °C for 5 h, the as-obtained TiNb2O7 nanowires exhibited a specific capacity of 199.6 mA h g−1 after 500 cycles at 0.4 A g−1 and 97.7 mA h g−1 after 2000 cycles at 5 A g−1, which was better than that of the TiNb2O7 nanoparticles (TN), as the 1D structure integrates the merits of a reduced lithium diffusion length, increased active sites, a short electronic transport path and excellent reaction dynamics, which are responsible for the enhanced electrochemical properties.

3.4. 3D ordered macro/mesoporous TiNb2O7
Materials with three-dimensional ordered macro/mesoporous (3DOM) architectures have been regarded as attractive electrodes for energy storage and conversion applications owing to their novel structural characteristics such as a high surface-area-to-volume ratio and vast pore volume.88,98,99 Typically, hierarchical 3DOM architectures are usually constructed from the interconnected networks of nanosized walls and pores, in which the continuous nanosized walls can provide 3D transport pathways for electronic/ionic transportation with short diffusion lengths and simultaneously highly active intercalation sites, while the interconnected network of pores is greatly beneficial for a close direct contact with liquid electrolytes. These amazing advantages make 3DOM architectures promising electrodes for energy storage applications. Therefore, the syntheses of 3DOM structures have received considerable attention and various strategies have been developed. Generally, 3DOM is fabricated by template methods, and the ordered porous structure is usually constructed by replicating the structure of stacked hard/soft templates (i.e., SiO2 spheres, polystyrene (PS) spheres, AAO, etc.).88,98,99 Recently, the construction of 3DOM structured TiNb2O7 has been reported as an anode material for lithium storage.
It's well recognized that the TiNb2O7 phase can only be produced by annealing at high temperature which would result in the formation of large-sized TiNb2O7 crystals, thus leading to poor rate capability when applied as a LIB anode material.88 To overcome this drawback, Jo et al. prepared ordered mesoporous TiNb2O7 (denoted as m-TNO) using block copolymer assisted self-assembly (Fig. 16a–c).88 In the organic solvent of tetrahydrofuran (THF), hydrolyzed titanium isopropoxide and niobium ethoxide precursors were readily coordinated with the assistance of the structure-directing agent poly-(ethylene oxide)-b-poly(styrene), forming an ordered mesoporous structure via an evaporation-induced self-assembly (EISA) process and subsequently annealing. Note that the introduction of trace tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) during the synthesis can enhance the thermal and mechanical stability by the in situ generated silica which can be removed by alkaline etching. Consequently, the as-prepared 3DOM m-TNO networks were composed of small nanocrystals (∼15 nm) and large pores (∼40 nm), which displayed a high surface area of 74 m2 g−1 and a large pore volume of 0.37 cm3 g−1. As an anode for LIBs, 3DOM m-TNO demonstrated superior lithium storage performance (Fig. 16d and e), exhibiting a high capacity of 289 mA h g−1 at 0.1C, and an excellent rate performance of 162 mA h g−1 at 20C and 116 mA h g−1 at 50C (=19.35 A g−1) in 1.0–3.0 V, which surpassed that of other Ti-and Nb-based anode materials (TiO2, Li4Ti5O12, Nb2O5, etc.). Besides, surface carbon coating has been an efficient strategy to enhance the surface stability and electrical conductivity of a material, as well as the electrical contact of particles. When m-TNO was coated with a carbon layer by carbonizing the surface coated polydopamine at 700 °C (denoted as m-TNO–C, 10 wt% C in content), the cycle stability of m-TNO–C was further improved, exhibiting a higher maximum capacity of 235 mA h g−1 at 10C (208 mA h g−1 in the m-TNO electrode) and excellent cycle stability ability with 191 mA h g−1 after 2000 cycles (81% retention, 0.022 mA h g−1 loss per cycle). The excellent electrochemical properties can be attributed to the novel hierarchically ordered mesoporous structure, which not only provided a short diffusion length for lithium ions/electrons but also the fast penetration of the electrolyte.

Lou et al. demonstrated the fabrication of 3DOM TiNb2O7 using polystyrene (PS) colloidal crystals as a hard template (Fig. 16f–h).61 The closely packed PS spheres were soaked in the precursor solution of mixed metal salt (NbCl5/C16H36O4Ti with a Nb/Ti molar ratio of 2/1) in the ethyl alcohol solvent, followed by the removal of an excessive solution via vacuum filtration. The PS spheres were removed by calcination in air atmosphere at 900 °C, leaving ordered pores and interconnected single-crystalline TiNb2O7 nanoparticles, which displayed a homogeneous and continuous honeycomb-like construction with a surface area of 26.99 m2 g−1. As a result, 3DOM TiNb2O7 showed a remarkably high rate capability (120 mA h g−1 at 50C) and superior long-term cycle stability (82% capacity retention over 1000 cycles at 10C) (Fig. 16i and j). This unique 3DOM architecture provided favorable kinetics including facile Li+ insertion/extraction and fast electron transfer pathways, enabling fast lithium ion pseudocapacitive charge storage, and finally leading to good rate capability and long-term cycle life.
Li et al. prepared 3D ordered porous TiNb2O7 nanotubes (denoted as 3D-O-PTNO) using AAO membrane as a template (Fig. 16k and l), in which Ti–Nb sol (niobium chloride and titanium(IV) isopropoxide in ethanol) was filled, followed by vacuum drying and then calcining at 700 °C for 2 h under an Ar flow.89 After the removal of the AAO template by etching with 2 M H3PO4 solution, 3D-O-PTNO showed an orderly aligned hollow tubular morphology with tube diameters of ∼200 nm, a large specific surface area of 50.2 m2 g−1 and a pore volume of 0.15 cm3 g−1. When examined as an anode for LIBs, the as-prepared 3D-O-PTNO demonstrated superior lithium insertion properties, exhibiting high discharge capacities of 328.3, 248.1, 209.3 and 116.6 mA h g−1 at 0.1, 5, 10 and 30C (Fig. 16m and n), respectively. These values are dramatically higher than that of bulk TNO obtained without the introduction of AAO, suggesting the high rate capability of 3D-O-PTNO. Besides, the long-term cycling performance was also amazing, showing a stable reversible capacity of about 235 mA h g−1 after 500 cycles at 5C. This work sheds new light on the development of energy storage devices with both high energy density and high power density.
3.5. TiNb2O7 films
With the miniaturization of electronics, the development of rechargeable micro-batteries has attracted considerable attention because of their high volumetric energy density and gravimetric energy density, superior power capability and design flexibility and their small size, which are useful and widely used as backup power sources in micro-sensors, smartphones, electronic gadgets, and so on.100,101 To integrate micro-batteries into miniaturized electronic devices, thin-film electrodes of cathode and anode materials, which can be separated and combined by a polymer separator and Li+ conducting gel/solid electrolyte, are highly desired.
TiNb2O7 thin films have been recently prepared by the sol–gel method and pulsed laser deposition (PLD).102,103 Chang et al. prepared amorphous TiNb2O7 (TNO) thin films with a thickness of around 100 nm on ITO glass via a combined strategy of sol–gel and spin-coating methods (Fig. 17a–c), which showed excellent physical and dielectric properties.104 Daramalla et al. reported the fabrication of monoclinic and chemically pure TNO thin films by PLD (Fig. 17d–f), using a TiNb2O7 target which was prepared via a solid-state reaction of Nb2O5 and TiO2 at 1350 °C for 24 h.103 Single-phase TiNb2O7 films with a monoclinic crystal structure and thickness of around 300 nm were successfully deposited on Pt (200)/TiO2/SiO2/Si (100) substrates at 750 °C, and the film microstructures can be controlled by oxygen partial pressure during deposition, which affected the lithium storage properties. When applied as anodes for LIBs, the TNO thin films demonstrated superior structure stability with fast reaction kinetics. The grazing incident X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) patterns, as well as the SEM images of the as-deposited TNO thin films and their counterparts after battery cycling, both suggest that the TNO thin films showed small changes in the roughness and morphology (Fig. 17g), suggesting a small volume expansion with less strain in the films after lithiation. In addition, CV measurement demonstrated the excellent reversibility reaction of the film electrode with an average Li insertion voltage at 1.65 V (Fig. 17h and i). These results reveal that TiNb2O7 thin films can be a promising candidate anode for Li-ion micro-battery applications.

4. Analogues of TiNb2O7 as a LIB anode
Besides TiNb2O7, there are many other analogues in the family of Ti–Nb–O based compounds, such as Ti2Nb10O29,105–107 TiNb6O17,108,109 TiNb24O62,110,111 and Ti2Nb2O9,112 which display many similarities with respect to the crystal structure, lithium storage mechanism, and synthetic strategies, with that of TiNb2O7. The lattice parameters of TiNb2O7 and its analogues are compared in Table 3. The structural engineering strategies discussed above can be readily applied for the syntheses of these different analogues, with the only difference in the stoichiometric ratio of Ti/Nb, which can be controlled by adjusting the introduction amount of the Ti/Nb precursors during the synthesis. Table 4 summarizes the syntheses and lithium storage performances of these different Ti–Nb–O analogues.

4.1. Ti2Nb10O29
The crystal structure of monoclinic Ti2Nb10O29 (the ReO3 type of the A2/m space group) is constructed from a crystallographic shear (c.s.) plane along the [010] direction. The Ti(Nb)O6 octahedrons in this structure share the corners in the c.s. plane and the edges across the plane, forming a space gap that facilitates the Li+ insertion/deintercalation of small cations. Although the intrinsic electronic conductivity of Ti2Nb10O29 is also low, it has a higher theoretical capacity of 398 mA h g−1 and a suitable voltage platform of about 1.65 V, which shows a promising application in lithium ion batteries. The lithium insertion process of Ti2Nb10O29 was divided into two solid solution phase regions (1.0–1.5 V and 1.6–3.0 V) and a two-phase coexistence region (1.4–1.6 V), which was revealed by the in situ XRD analysis.122 Bulk Ti2Nb10O29 as a LIB anode delivered a reversible capacity of 293 mA h g−1 at 0.1C and 168 mA h g−1 at 10C.105 To enhance the electronic conductivity and electrochemical properties of Ti2Nb10O29, some efficient strategies have been developed via structure engineering, such as introducing oxygen vacancies, doping, and hybridizing with conductive agents.113–115,123 Liu et al.114 prepared a Ti2Nb10O29/C (TNO/C) composite with much enhanced electrochemical performance, delivering a discharge capacity of 295.5 mA h g−1 at 1C, 204 mA h g−1 at 10C and 145 mA h g−1 at 30C. Besides, Ag nanoparticle-coated Ti2Nb10O29 (ref. 115) and Ti2Nb10O29/reduced graphene oxide composites124 also showed enhanced lithium storage capability due to the presence of the conductive phase.
Well-defined structures such as 1D nanofibers, 3D meso/microporous spheres, can provide more reactive sites and improve the electron/Li+-ion transport. Ti2Nb10O29 nanofibers constructed from highly crystalline nanocrystalline125 and Ti2Nb10O29 hollow nanofibers116 were prepared and showed high lithium storage performance (Table 4). 3D meso/microporous spheres of Ti2Nb10O29 were also developed. Liu et al.126 prepared mesoporous Ti2Nb10O29 microspheres, which delivered a capacity of 173.5 mA h g−1 after 500 cycles at 10C. Introducing templates (such as P123, F127, etc.) during synthesis is an effective way to improve the porous structure. Xia et al.106 constructed Ti2Nb10O29 nanospheres with an interconnected porous network using P123 as a template, delivering a high capacity of 215 mA h g−1 after 500 cycles at 10C. Similarly, Lou et al.127 fabricated Ti2Nb10O29 hierarchical nanospheres using F127 as a template, which demonstrates excellent cycling stability (141.6 mA h g−1 after 1000 cycles at 10C). The hollow Ti2Nb10O29 microspheres using microspheres of resorcinol formaldehyde (RF) resin as a template also exhibited superior electrochemical performance with excellent high rate performance (103.7 mA h g−1 at 50C) and long cycle life (164.7 mA h g−1 after 500 cycles at 10C).128 In addition, Deng et al.129 reported Ti2Nb10O29−x mesoporous microspheres with oxygen vacancies and an increased unit cell volume by a one-step solvothermal method followed by thermal treatment in N2 (Fig. 18a and b). The crystal-structure modification decreased the polarization and improved the electrochemical kinetics, and thus Ti2Nb10O29−x delivered reversible capacities of 309 mA h g−1 and 235 mA h g−1 at 0.1C and 40C, respectively (Fig. 18c and d). Furthermore, carbon hybridization was also adopted to enhance the electrode conductivity. For example, porous Ti2Nb10O29/C microspheres and nitrogen doped carbon layer coated 3D porous Ti2Nb10O29 microspheres were designed and investigated, which both showed enhanced electrochemical performance with superior high-rate performance and unexpected cycle stability.117,130 These excellent electrochemical properties can be attributed to the rational structure engineering.

The direct growth of active materials on a 3D conductive array skeleton (i.e., carbon cloth and carbon nanofibers) is highly desirable, which can not only avoid the use of binders, but also possess a high specific surface area and fast transportation paths for ions/electrons around the active materials. Tang et al.64 prepared hierarchical carbon nanofibers@Ti2Nb10O29 arrays which were grown on carbon cloth (CNFs@TNO/CC) by electrophoretic deposition and solvothermal methods. The strong bonding between the intertwined CNF arrays and the TNO nanoparticles (20–50 nm) benefited to increase the conductivity, mechanical stability, and surface exposure, thus resulting in greatly improved Li+ diffusion coefficients, compared with previous studies (Table 5). Remarkably, the present CNFs@TNO/CC displayed an excellent capacity of 308 mA h g−1 at 1C with a high initial coulombic efficiency of 91%, and capacity retention of 192.6 mA h g−1 after 1000 cycles at 10C, illustrating its great potential for ultrafast LIB applications. Instead, Yao et al. fabricated TiC/C core/shell arrays on a Ti6Al4V mesh via a one-step CVD process using acetone as the carbon source, which was used as a carrier to enhance the conductivity and structural stability of electrode materials.131,132 When anchoring Ti2Nb10O29 (TNO) nanoparticles and protected with N-doped carbon (NC) shells, the as-prepared NC–TNO@TiC/C core/shell arrays demonstrated preeminent high-rate capacities (318 mA h g−1 at 1C and 202 mA h g−1 at 50C) and long cycle life with a capacity retention of 85% after 10000 cycles at 10C.124 Moreover, Deng et al. realized the integration of Ti2Nb10O29 (TNO) nanoparticles and vertical graphene (VG) arrays with an intimate core/shell structure, which were grown on carbon cloth and further protected by the conductive shells of hydrogen molybdenum bronze (HMB) (Fig. 18e–g).118 The ultimate VG/TNO/HMB core/shell composite arrays showed superior high-rate capability (220 mA h g−1 at 20C, 163 mA h g−1 at 60C) and better cycling life (174 mA h g−1 after 1000 cycles at 30C) (Fig. 18h and i). These results provided a good solution to improve the lithium storage performance of Ti2Nb10O29-based and other high-specific-capacity electrode materials, which will promote the development of high-power lithium-ion batteries.

4.2. TiNb6O17
TiNb6O17 shows a similar crystal structure (Fig. 19a) to Ti2Nb10O29 (Wadsley–Roth shear structure), but larger lattice parameters and a large number of cation vacancies (0.49% vs. all cations sites), which benefit to increase Li+ diffusion coefficients.109 The excellent lithium diffusion kinetics in TiNb6O17 was attributed to the large unit cell volume and more open Li+ insertion sites, as confirmed by CV, EIS and GITT analyses.119 More importantly, TiNb6O17 has a larger theoretical capacity of 397 mA h g−1 and a suitable working potential (∼1.7 V). Lin et al. prepared TiNb6O17 by the solid-state reaction method, which delivered a large initial discharge capacity of 383 mA h g−1 at 0.1C and reversible capacity of 178 mA h g−1 with only 4.6% loss after 100 cycles at 5C.109 After coating with carbon, the TiNb6O17/C composite, which was prepared by a solid-state reaction using glucose as the carbon source,120 exhibited enhanced rate capability (239, 225.1 and 199.8 mA h g−1 at 1, 5 and 10C), as compared with pure TiNb6O17. Remarkably, distributing TiNb6O17 nanocrystals within amorphous carbon allowed greatly improved rate capability, displaying a high rate capacity of 129 mA h g−1 at 30C and a capacity of 181 mA h g−1 with a capacity retention of 92.0% after 500 cycles at 10C.133

TiNb6O17 nano/microspheres with a mesoporous structure have also been applied as LIB anodes and exhibited excellent electrochemical performance. Ma et al.63 constructed well-defined mesoporous TiNb6O17 microspheres assembled by interconnected nanocrystals through a solvothermal reaction followed by thermal treatment (Fig. 19b–g), and the TiNb6O17 microspheres exhibited a high capacity of 310.2 mA h g−1 at 0.2C and good rate performance (273.7, 228.2 and 175.3 mA h g−1 at 1, 10 and 30C) and long-cycle stability (a discharge capacity of 159.5 mA h g−1, after 500 cycles at 10C). Owing to the hierarchical mesoporous structure, which provided a large electrode/electrolyte interfacial area and reduced the diffusion distance of Li+, the electrochemical reactions were dominated by both pseudocapacitive behavior and an ion diffusion mechanism. Meanwhile, ordered mesoporous TiNb6O17 microspheres also showed good rate performance with a discharge capacity of 265.7, 206.9 and 172.4 mA h g−1 at 1, 10 and 30C.108 Furthermore, Yuan et al.134 prepared TiNb6O17 nanospheres via an electrostatic spraying route and reported their lithium storage performance, delivering an initial discharge capacity of 245 mA h g−1 at 0.5C and reversible capacity of 159.1 mA h g−1 after 150 cycles.
4.3. TiNb24O62
TiNb24O62 possesses the perfect Wadsley–Roth shear structure with a unit composed of a 3 × 4 octahedron-block and a 0.5 tetrahedron at the block-corner.111 According to a general chemical formula of TiNbxO2+2.5x (eqn: C = 403 − 5441/(133x + 80) mA h g−1), TiNb24O62 (x = 24) exhibited a maximum theoretical capacity of 401 mA h g−1 in these TiNbxO2+2.5x compounds. Yang et al.111 prepared porous TiNb24O62 microspheres via a simple solvothermal method (Fig. 20a–d), and the unique mesoporous structure effectively provided more reaction sites and shortened the electron/Li+ transmission distance, which displayed high rate capacity (261, 222 and 202 mA h g−1 at 1, 10 and 20C) and excellent cycle stability (183 mA h g−1 over 500 cycles at 10C) (Fig. 20e–g). Later, Grey et al.135 first realized accurate refinement of the lattice and atomic coordinates of the TiNb24O62 structure using neutron diffraction and reported its excellent electrochemical performance.

To enhance the electrode conductivity, holey graphene-wrapped porous TiNb24O62 microparticles were prepared and delivered a high capacity of 323 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1, retaining 183 mA h g−1 even at 10 A g−1.136 In addition, nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) coating was also performed on TiNb24O62, and this TiNb24O62/NC electrode delivered a high reversible capacity of 218 mA h g−1 at 0.5C, and 148.9 mA h g−1 after 900 cycles at 10C (Fig. 20h–k).110 When matched with the LiFePO4 cathode, the full cell delivered an initial discharge capacity of 112.7 mA h g−1 at 1C with a stable capacity retention of 107.7 mA h g−1 after 51 cycles (Fig. 20l and m).
4.4. Others
Except for the widely studied TiNbxO2+2.5x family (x = 2, 5, 6 and 24), there are some reports on Ti–Nb–O contained compounds, such as HTiNbO5, HTi2NbO7, Ti2Nb2O9, and Ti2Nb14O39, which have also been investigated and showed great potential for energy storage applications. Pralong et al.137 prepared layer-structured HTiNbO5 using KTiNbO5 as the raw material through an ion exchange reaction. This structure is composed of (Ti/Nb)O6 octahedrons with shared angles and edges. HTiNbO5 delivered a reversible capacity of 140 mA h g−1 at 0.1C in 1.0–3.0 V and can maintain ∼120 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles. Furthermore, H0.92K0.08TiNbO5 nanowires composed of many small “lumps” were prepared via electrospinning followed by an ion-exchange reaction (Fig. 21), which exhibited a high reversible capacity of 186.1 mA h g−1 at 0.5C and 123.7 mA h g−1 after 150 cycles.121

Interestingly, topotactic dehydration of HTiNbO5 resulted in the formation of tunnel structured Ti2Nb2O9, which represented a meaningful direction for lithium insertion. The empty tunnel structure of Ti2Nb2O9 allowed reversible lithium intercalation, forming the phase of Li4Ti2Nb2O9via a solid-solution process, which delivered a capacity of 125 mA h g−1 after 30 cycles.112 Furthermore, layered HTi2NbO7 was also synthesized via solid-state calcination followed by ion exchange, and used as an anode electrode material for sodium ion batteries.138 Other unique HTi2NbO7 materials have also been investigated and widely used in the field of photocatalysis.139–141 Besides, Ti2Nb14O39 porous spheres with a defective shear ReO3 crystal structure exhibited superior electrochemical performance as LIB anodes, including high reversible capacity (326 mA h g−1 at 0.1C), rate capability (223 mA h g−1 at 40C) and durable cycling stability (only 0.032% capacity loss per cycle over 200 cycles at 10C). Inspired by these studied, it's anticipated that more Ti–Nb–O compounds would be worth researching in order to find an ideal electrode material for high-efficiency lithium-ion battery systems.
5. Applications of TiNb2O7 and its analogues in other energy storage systems
5.1. Sodium ion batteries
Sodium ion batteries (SIBs) have been regarded as promising alternatives to LIBs owing to the low cost and abundant resource of sodium on earth.142–144 However, the larger radius of Na+ than that of Li+ results in sluggish kinetics and larger insertion barriers, thus resulting in low sodium storage capacities and poor cycle/rate performance.145–147 To date, there are only a few reports using TiNb2O7 and its analogues as anodes for sodium storage, and some strategies have been developed to enhance the sodium storage performance, such as amorphization, nanosizing and hybridizing with carbon-based materials.62,65,138
For microparticulate TiNb2O7 crystals with high crystallinity which were usually prepared by the solid-state method, the sodium insertion into the lattices is hard and different from that of LIBs, thus resulting in limited sodium storage capacity. Huang et al.148 demonstrated a strategy to enhance the sodium storage performance of pristine TiNb2O7 by ball milling, which not only converted the microcrystals into disordered nanocrystals but also produced amorphous phases with high defects and a large surface area, thus resulting in predominant pseudo-capacitive sodium storage (Fig. 22a–d). Therefore, decreasing the particle size (i.e., nanosizing) can be an efficient strategy and easily realized by solution-based synthesis, which also facilitated to introduce various carbon matrices to enhance the electrode conductivity. Consequently, hybridizing TiNb2O7 nanoparticles with graphene sheets, or carbon nanotubes, have demonstrated much-enhanced sodium storage performance. For example, Li et al.149 reported the fabrication of TiNb2O7/graphene composites, which delivered a high reversible capacity of 340.2 mA h g−1 at 25 mA g−1 and stable capacity of 200 mA h g−1 at 200 mA g−1 (Fig. 22e–g). Shang et al.62 demonstrated that a TiNb2O7/carbon nanotube composite can display a high reversible capacity of ∼300 mA h g−1 at 50 mA g−1 and superior rate performance of ∼110 mA h g−1 even at 500 mA g−1 after 1000 cycles (Fig. 22h–j). Kinetic analyses based on CV and GITT measurements also revealed that the sodium storage was mainly dominated by the pseudocapacitive process.

Lowering Na+ diffusion barriers by nanosizing has been well clarified experimentally and theoretically by Shen et al.,65 who successfully prepared ultrathin Ti2Nb2O9 nanosheets in high yield through a scalable liquid exfoliation strategy followed by topotactic dehydration. The ultrathin Ti2Nb2O9 nanosheets delivered a reversible capacity of 250 mA h g−1 at 50 mA g−1 and excellent rate capability (242, 182, and 134 mA h g−1 at 100, 1000, and 4000 mA g−1) in 0.01–3.0 V, when compared to bulk Ti2Nb2O9 (only 36 mA h g−1 at 4000 mA g−1). The electrochemical kinetic analysis suggested the predomination of pseudocapacitive storage, which was related to the novel structural advantages including the ultrahigh surface area, expanded interlayer spacing, and abundant nanoporosity of the ultrathin Ti2Nb2O9 nanosheets. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations illustrated that the lowest diffusion barrier of Na atoms in Ti2Nb2O9 was ∼0.20 eV along the [100] direction, which was much smaller than that for Na diffusion in other Ti-based oxides, such as Li4Ti5O12 (∼0.91 eV). In contrast, Xie et al.138 prepared layered HTi2NbO7via solid-state calcination followed by ion exchange, and the thick lamellar HTi2NbO7 only showed a specific capacity of ∼90 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1 after 2000 cycles, even though showing long-life cycling stability. Based on previous reports, the sodium storage in Ti–Nb–O based anodes is mainly pseudocapacitive and can be enhanced by decreasing the particle size and increasing the surface area.
5.2. Hybrid supercapacitors
Li-ion hybrid supercapacitors (Li-HSCs) are promising electrochemical energy storage devices due to their high energy and power density, which generally consist of a lithium-insertion-type material (anode) and a high-surface-area carbonaceous material (cathode) in a nonaqueous medium. As a typical insertion material, the application of TiNb2O7 in Li-HSCs has been investigated owing to the intrinsic fast pseudocapacitive behavior and excellent electrochemical performance with respect to reversibility, cyclability, and safety.79 However, the disadvantages of its low electronic conductivity and sluggish solid-state Li+ diffusion are obvious, and further development of TiNb2O7 with advanced structural modification strategies is of great importance to achieve faster kinetics in Li-HSCs.
To enhance the electronic conductivity and Li+ diffusion rate of TiNb2O7 based anodes in HSCs, 1D structures and 3D ordered structures have been adopted and studied (Table 6). For example, Aravindan et al.79 reported the application of electrospun TiNb2O7 nanofibers as an insertion-type anode in Li-HSCs, using activated carbon (AC) as a counter electrode (Fig. 11d and e) which delivered very high energy and power densities (∼43 W h kg−1 at ∼3 kW kg−1) and excellent cyclability (84% of the initial value after 3000 cycles) (Fig. 23a and b). Besides, Wang et al.84 prepared TiNb2O7 nanoparticle-assembled microwires via electrospinning, which were coated with a carbon layer by glucose carbonization. When matched with a carbon fiber (CF) cathode in Li-HSCs, the as-fabricated TiNb2O7@carbon (TNO@C) composite delivered a high energy density of 110.4 W h kg−1 at a power density of 99.58 W kg−1, and energy density of 20 W h kg−1 at a power density of 5.46 kW kg−1, with a capacitance retention of 77% after 1500 cycles at 0.2 A g−1 (Fig. 23e and f). Differently, Zhang et al.89 reported the use of 3D ordered porous TiNb2O7 (3D-O-P-TNO) nanotubes as an anode in Li-HSCs (Fig. 16k and l). The 3D-OP-TNO//graphene hybrid supercapacitor delivered a high energy density of ∼74 W h kg−1 with outstanding cycle stability (43.8 W h kg−1 at 1 A g−1 after 3000 cycles, Fig. 23c and d). Recently, a holey graphene supported TiNb2O7 network nanostructure was also applied as an anode material for Li-HSCs and delivered a high energy density of 86.3 W h kg−1 at a high power density of 3.88 kW kg−1, with excellent cycling stability (90.2% of initial capacity after 3000 cycles).150

Beyond TiNb2O7, the analogue TiNb24O62 was also adopted in Li-HSCs. Li et al.136 prepared a holey graphene-wrapped porous TiNb24O62 composite to improve the electrode conductivity. When matched with a carbon nanosheet based cathode in Li-HSCs (Fig. 23g and h), the TiNb24O62//carbon nanosheet capacitor delivered high energy densities of 103.9 W h kg−1 and 28.9 W h kg−1 at power densities of 75.8 W kg−1 and 17.9 kW kg−1, respectively. Even after 10000 cycles at a high power density of 17.9 kW kg−1, a high capacity retention of 81.8% can be maintained. Based on the above discussion, we can observe that the introduction of conductive carbon can remarkably enhance the electrochemical properties of TiNb2O7 and its analogues in Li-HSCs because of the enhanced electronic conductivity. These Li-HSCs demonstrated much higher energy/power densities than symmetric supercapacitors such as carbon fibers//carbon fibers and CMK-3//CMK-3, indicating the potential for practical applications in hybrid electric vehicles and electric vehicles. Therefore, further explorations through structural control and advanced modification strategies should be performed to meet the commercial needs of high energy and high power hybrid energy storage devices.
5.3. Vanadium redox flow batteries
Vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFBs, a scheme in Fig. 24a) are considered as an efficient, green, and reliable energy storage system due to their long life, simple operation, low maintenance costs, and high capacity.151 Currently, graphite felt (GF) has been widely used as an electrode material for VRFBs due to its reasonable price, high stability, and wide operating voltage range. However, the disadvantages are also obvious for vanadium redox reactions, such as unsatisfactory electrolyte accessibility and low kinetic reversibility. To overcome these disadvantages and enhance their electrochemical activity, surface modification of GFs with metal oxides as catalysts has gained considerable attention, and TiNb2O7 has been considered as a promising candidate owing to its novel structure characteristics, such as a high potential window and unique chemical stability under acidic conditions. Kabtamu et al.152 prepared a TiNb2O7 nanoparticle-modified GF electrode (Fig. 24b and c), which showed much enhanced electrocatalytic activity toward the VO2+/VO2+ redox couple, with an average energy efficiency (EE) of 79.06% at 100 mA cm−2 and no observable decay in the efficiencies after 100 cycles at 80 mA cm−2, better than that for the heat-treated GF (HT-GF) and pristine GF (P-GF) electrodes (Fig. 24d). In addition, Wang et al.153 synthesized a TiNb2O7-reduced graphene oxide (TiNb2O7–rGO) nanocomposite, which exhibited excellent electrocatalytic activity toward both VO2+/VO2+ and V3+/V2+ reactions at the positive electrode and the negative electrode, respectively. The TiNb2O7–rGO-modified GF electrodes delivered an energy efficiency of 83.1% and 79.7% at the current densities of 80 and 120 mA cm−2, respectively, which showed a significant enhancement over the cell assembled using GF. Furthermore, the TiNb2O7–rGO-based VRFB exhibited outstanding stability with higher energy efficiency and a rare capacity decay after 200 cycles at 120 mA cm−2 (Fig. 24e–h). Apparently, the modification of GFs with TiNb2O7 has demonstrated promising efficacy to enhance the electrochemical activities and cycle stability of vanadium redox flow batteries, and it's anticipated that further improvement can be achieved by rationally engineering the microstructures of TiNb2O7, as we discussed above in this Review.

6. Conclusion and outlook
To summarize, we comprehensively reviewed the latest significant progress in the structural engineering, material fabrication and enhancement of the electrochemical performances of micro/nanostructured TiNb2O7 and its analogues (i.e., Ti2Nb10O29, TiNb6O17, etc.) towards high-performance energy storage systems, including LIBs, SIBs, Li-HSCs, and VRFBs. As for lithium storage, TiNb2O7 and its analogues demonstrated higher theoretical capacities (larger than that of graphite anodes), even at high working potentials (>1.0 V vs. Li/Li+), at which the formation of SEI films and lithium dendrites can be avoided, thus endowing them with higher safety. Despite the great promise for practical applications, TiNb2O7 and its analogue anodes still faced some intrinsic disadvantages, including low electronic conductivity, low ionic diffusion coefficient, and limited Nb metal resources. These shortcomings are not only the obstacles towards the successful development of TiNb2O7-related materials, but also point out the direction for future research. Although great progress has been made to enhance their lithium storage performances with respect to cycling stability and rate capability, further fundamental studies are still needed in the following aspects.
(1) In-depth fundamental studies on the lithium storage mechanism of TiNb2O7-related materials should be performed by adopting advanced in situ/ex situ characterization techniques combined with theoretical calculations. Currently, fully lithiated TiNb2O7 was regarded as solid-solution Li4TiNb2O7 with only four-electron transfer, as revealed by the in situ XRD analysis, which is lower than that of the theoretical values and need further clarification. Thus, micro/nano-batteries based on highly crystalline TiNb2O7 with a well-defined orientation (i.e., single 1D nanowires/rods, etc.) should be developed and studied by in situ TEM analysis, so that the real-time structure evolutions upon lithium intercalation/deintercalation can be investigated on the atomic scale. In addition, the chemical state evolutions are also crucially important to uncover the lithium storage mechanism, and some in situ/ex situ studies (i.e., electron spin-resonance spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES), etc.) should be carried out to trace the valence state changes of Ti/Nb during electrochemical reactions.
(2) To further remarkably enhance the lithium storage performance of TiNb2O7 and its analogues in terms of higher specific capacity, better cycling stability and rate capability, co-engineering the micro/nanostructures, modifying electrolytes, the introduction of chemically and electrochemically stable coat layers and combination of multiple designed strategies are important. Carbon hybridization including carbon coating with delicate design can be an efficient way to enhance the electrical conductivity of electrodes, but may decrease the overall capacity or block the efficient lithium intercalation into the lattice structures of TiNb2O7-related anodes. Besides, hierarchical micro/nanostructuring with multiple dimensions and appropriate pore/surface features can allow efficient electrolyte/lithium diffusion and provide maximum electrochemically active sites for lithium storage. Moreover, the larger exposed surface can bring about additional lithium storage capacity with higher rate capability through pseudocapacitive behavior, but may produce side reactions and SEI films owing to the nanosize effect. Balancing this contradiction needs much practice to realize the optimal electrochemical performance.
(3) Industrial applications of materials rely on their large-scale mass production. Although various synthetic strategies, including solid-phase reactions, sol–gel, hydro/solvothermal reactions, electrospinning, and so on, have been developed for the fabrications of various well-defined TiNb2O7 and its analogues micro/nanostructures with different dimensions/shapes/compositions, challenges still exist in designing more versatile and reliable but simple synthetic schemes for the large-scale production of tailored TiNb2O7 and its analogues micro/nanostructures.
(4) Although various synthetic strategies have been used to prepare TiNb2O7 and its analogues with various morphologies and sizes, the growth mechanisms concerning the formation of these structures remain largely unknown. Precise detection of the development from precursors to final morphology formation, in situ characterization techniques for real-time observation, and theory development to explain the formation processes are necessary.
(5) Structural optimization towards better electrochemical performance largely relies on the structural characteristics of TiNb2O7, such as the specific surface areas, the pore features, the dimensionality (i.e., shapes, sizes, and morphologies), the hybridization styles, and the introduction of heterogeneous components. Especially, porous materials with a 3D hierarchical structure can increase the contact area between the electrode and the electrolyte, shorten the lithium ion diffusion path, and improve the electronic conductivity of the material. The addition of heterogeneous elements can produce lattice defects that may increase both electronic and ionic conductivities and provide additional theoretical capacity. The combination of TiNb2O7 with other functional materials to form hybrid structures and surface coating of TiNb2O7 should be taken into account to create or use the potentially synergistic enhancement effect.
(6) Even though great progress has been made on the preparation and electrochemical properties of TiNb2O7-related anode materials, half-cell studies are still far away from practical applications, so it is important to investigate the electrochemical performance in full-cell systems in the future. To meet industrial requirements, some aspects of testing conditions for full-cells, such as a high mass loading, optimized cathode to anode ratio, minimal electrolyte usage, and so on, should be considered. Additionally, the cost, areal capacity, and cycling life together with the gravimetric/volumetric system energy density should also be evaluated.
(7) Besides LIBs, TiNb2O7 and its analogues have also demonstrated great potential in other electrochemical energy storage systems, such as SIBs, Li-HSCs, and VRFBs, but were insufficiently studied. This Review provided comprehensively engineering strategies and various micro/nanostructures, which can be used to enhance their electrochemical performance and promote the broader application of these TiNb2O7-related materials.
(8) Owing to the novel structure characteristics, the relatively high-capacity, high-rate, long-life, and high-safety properties are well integrated in the electrodes of TiNb2O7 and its analogues, as compared with the current graphite anodes (low-rate performance), silicon-based anodes (poor cycling stability) and Li4Ti5O12 (low specific capacity). It's anticipated that TiNb2O7 and its analogues may be not ideal anodes for high energy density batteries in large-scale applications owing to the rare resource of Nb, their high-cost and high lithium-storage potential, but they are promising candidates for high-rate, long-life, and high-safety battery applications in some particularly important fields (e.g., portable military power sources), which is a worthwhile direction for future research.
