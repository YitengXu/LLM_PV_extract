    , Accepted 27th October 2021First published on 28th October 2021AbstractTo facilitate the device optimization of organic solar cells, a conjugated macrocycle, namely cyanostar, has, for the first time, been utilized to simultaneously modify the active layer and hole transporting layer. Benefiting from the sequential deposition technology, cyanostar is able to percolate into the underlying PEDOT:PSS and the upper active layer, while a transition layer enriched with cyanostar is formed as well. Owing to the positively charged hydrogens and the low-lying energy levels, cyanostar can simultaneously p-dope the PEDOT:PSS layer and polymer donor. Such doping effect can prolong the carrier lifetime, suppress charge recombination, and promote charge transport and extraction. Moreover, cyanostar positively or negatively affects the morphology depending on its distribution in the active layer due to the different miscibility. Based on the synergistic effects of cyanostar, the champion device achieves a power conversion efficiency of 17.98%. Cyanostar is also applicable in varying donor/acceptor combinations. This work paves the way to employ conjugated macrocycles as versatile additives in organic solar cells.
Introduction
As one of the emerging technologies for clean energy conversion, organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted tremendous attention from both the scientific and industrial communities due to their advantages of mechanical flexibility, light weight, and high-throughput fabrication.1–5 Owing to the innovation of photovoltaic materials, in particular that of non-fullerene acceptors, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of OSCs have achieved remarkable improvements in the past decade.6–14 Meanwhile, to realize efficient OSCs, meticulous device engineering is also desired for the modification of the active layer and the interface in the sandwich configuration of OSCs.15–20 To some extent, such tedious procedures for device optimization increase the manufacturing complexity and raise the batch-to-batch variety, impeding the access of OSCs in the consumer market.
As for the active layer, bulk heterojunction (BHJ) is the most used architecture in state-of-the-art OSCs, wherein a bicontinuous and interpenetrating network is expected to be built by blending and fabricating electron-donor and acceptor materials together to provide sufficient donor–acceptor interfaces for exciton dissociation and nano-scale phase separation as the charge-transporting pathway. However, such ideal BHJ structures are hardly realized by direct solution-process deposition of the donor–acceptor blend solution, in which additional driving force is essential to implement the entropically and thermodynamically unfavorable process.21–25 As a result, the addition of extra components, besides the photoactive materials for light harvesting, is of vital importance to regulate the electronic properties and morphology of the active layers. For example, solvent additives (e.g., 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO)26 and 1-chloronaphthalene (CN)27) have been demonstrated to be able to prolong the film-formation process and selectively regulate the donor/acceptor distribution. To avoid the disadvantages of solvent additives in device stability and reproducibility, some small molecules with high volatility have been successfully utilized to optimize the morphology during film formation and the following thermal annealing process, the latter of which would remove the solid additive from the active layer as well.28–33 Nonvolatile graphdiyne is also able to be used as a solid additive in active layers.34 Yang et al. revealed that a matrix constructed by an insulating polymer in the active layers improved the flexibility and stability while the PCE was dramatically enhanced.35 Besides the adjustment of morphology, the electronic properties are finely tuned by molecular doping, which has been most recently developed by directly adding neutral organic molecules with strong electron-withdrawing (p-dopant)36–43 or donating (n-dopant)44–50 abilities into active layers. Attributing to the charge transfer between the dopant and the donor or acceptor materials, it has been demonstrated that the electronic properties, including the photoconductivity, carrier mobility, and charge recombination, could be improved based on the documented attempts.39,45,51–53
Moreover, the interface of OSCs also plays a vital role in boosting the photovoltaic performance. According to the mechanism of OSCs, the generated free charges, electron and hole, from the splitting of exciton in active layers, need to be extracted by electrodes to create photocurrent. However, the unfavorable interface restrains the extraction efficiency due to the mismatch of energy alignment and the existence of interfacial defect. As a result, interfacial doping by organic electrolytes is essential for almost all efficient OSCs. For example, the doped complex PEDOT:PSS consisting of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) and poly(styrene sulfonate) is able to modify the anode to provide suitable work function and good ohmic contact for hole transport, rendering its success as the mostly used hole-transporting material in conventional configuration OSCs.19 As for the modification of the cathode, organic electrolytes, e.g. PFN,54–56 PDINO,57–59 PEIE60–63 and fullerene self-assembled monolayer,64 are also able to reduce the extraction barrier and interfacial defect by the dipole interaction. Although these electrolytes have been widely used in OSCs and show excellent universality, additional components or modifications are often needed to further regulate the properties of interface layers to satisfy the requirements of varying scenarios.59,65–67
Although enormous paradigms, to modify either the active layer or the interface, have been reported so far, significant challenges remain unsolved in this field. First, the function of these documented additives is usually unitary, and thus two or more kinds of additives are inevitably utilized in a single device for individually optimizing the active layer or interface. To acquire the suitable and compatible combinations of additives, complex procedures were conducted by trial-and-error, which raise the batch-to-batch variety and are also detrimental to the cost control of OSCs.68–70 Second, the device fabrication with additive is harsh to some extent. Molecular doping in OSCs is extremely sensitive to the content of dopants, which is often limited at an ultralow concentration (<0.1%, w/w).37,39,43 Moreover, strong electron-withdrawing or donating groups are involved to achieve enough high electron affinity (p-dopant) or low ionization potential (n-dopant). Thus, the large dipole of dopants restrains the miscibility with photoactive materials, leading to unfavorable large-scale phase separation in active layers.37 With the addition of excessive dopants, the active layer may collapse due to the excessive oxidation or reduction induced by the charge transfer between dopant and photoactive materials. As for the interfacial modification, the device performance is very susceptible to the thickness of the interfacial layer. For example, the commonly used interlayer materials only work well at a relatively less thickness (<5 nm).55,59 Consequently, tedious optimization is essential to screen the processing conditions of device fabrication. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop versatile materials with the capability of being processed robustly to synergistically optimize the active layer and interface of OSCs.
To simultaneously modify the active layer and the interface, the top priority is to solve the compatibility of the additional component with photoactive materials and organic electrolytes, which have significantly different solubility. This issue might be addressed by a star-shaped macrocycle molecule, namely, cyanostar71 (Fig. 1). As a neutral molecule, cyanostar shows excellent solubility in common organic solvents, like chloroform and chlorobenzene, which ensures its miscibility with donor/acceptor materials in active layers. More importantly, cyanostar has been widely utilized in the fields of anion recognition due to the positively charged hydrogens.72–75 Thus, cyanostar might interact with the anions of organic electrolytes, which are utilized as interfacial layers in OSCs. Furthermore, the electron-withdrawing cyano groups endow cyanostar with low-lying energy levels, settling the probability of molecular doping. In addition, the electropositive central cavity surrounded by a large conjugation might be conducive to morphology molecular doping. In addition, the electropositive central cavity surrounded by a large conjugation might be conducive to the morphology optimization based on the non-covalent interaction. In this contribution, the macrocycle cyanostar was first, to the best of our knowledge, utilized in OSCs. By taking advantage of the sequential deposition, cyanostar successfully diffused into PEDOT:PSS and the active layer, while a layer enriched with cyanostar was retained for interfacial modification. Based on the aforementioned merits, both PEDOT:PSS and photovoltaic material could be p-doped by cyanostar. Moreover, the morphology of active layer was readily tuned by controlling the distribution of cyanostar. Attributing to the synergic effects of cyanostar, the device achieved a promising PCE of 17.98%. In addition, this strategy was applicable in varied donor–acceptor combinations, including the all-polymer solar cells, indicating that it is a feasible method for the manufacturing of OSCs.

Results and discussion
Characterization
The optoelectronic properties of cyanostar were characterized. As shown in Fig. S1,† the chloroform solution of cyanostar exhibits weak absorption with a maximum peak at 314 nm. The absorption spectrum in the solid state has similar features accompanied by a small redshift around 8 nm for the maximum peak, indicating a weak aggregation in the film. The energy levels of frontier orbitals were evaluated by performing ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS). The thin films cast on an aluminum substrate or PEDOT:PSS indicate that cyanostar possesses a low-lying highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) around −7.15 eV (Fig. 2a), while the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of cyanostar can be calculated as −3.97 eV (Fig. 2b). The atomic force microscopic (AFM) images (Fig. S2†) illustrate the amorphous feature of cyanostar in solid state, which was further verified by grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS, Fig. S3†). To address the compatibility issue of cyanostar with an organic electrolyte, an attempt to modify the hole-transporting material PEDOT:PSS was made. As shown in Fig. S4,† the suspension of cyanostar in isopropanol (2 mg mL−1) is evident owing to the extremely low solubility (∼0.03 mg mL−1) of cyanostar. With the addition of the PSS solution, the mixed solution becomes clear after stirring for 5 minutes, implying that cyanostar is ionized attributed to the ability of anion recognition and then gets dissolved in isopropanol. Based on this interaction between cyanostar and PSS, we speculate that cyanostar and PEDOT:PSS might form an ionic complex and thus change the original electronic properties of PEDOT:PSS. To verify that, UPS measurement was conducted in a bilayer film PEDOT:PSS/CS in which cyanostar abbreviated as CS was cast on top of PEDOT:PSS, showing a shift of work functions from 5.11 eV (PEDOT:PSS) to 5.27 eV (PEDOT:PSS/CS). In view of PM6's HOMO as −5.42 eV (Fig. S5†), the modified work function is prone to reconcile the charge transfer barrier and then improve the charge extraction efficiency. In addition, the downshifted work function of the hole-transporting layer (PEDOT:PSS/CS) is believed to enhance the Voc owing to the larger energy offset.

The potential impact caused by cyanostar on the active layer was further studied. Herein, a highly efficient combination of polymer donor PM6 and small molecule acceptor Y6 is chosen as the photovoltaic material. Given the low-lying energy levels of cyanostar, we attempted to affirm the probability of p-doping. By introducing small amounts (3–10% w/w) of cyanostar, new peaks in the long-wavelength region raise in the absorption spectra of the PM6 + CS blend film (Fig. S6†), which might be due to the polaron absorption. However, the absorption spectra remain almost identical with the addition of cyanostar in the Y6 + CS blend film (Fig. S7†). As shown in Fig. 2c, to acquire more direct evidence of p-doping, electron spin resonance (ESR) was performed. No obvious ESR signal is evident in neat PM6 or Y6 as well as the mixture of Y6 + CS, while the mixture PM6 + CS exhibits a strong ESR signal from the charge-transfer-induced unpaired electron, demonstrating that cyanostar is able to p-dope PM6 but not Y6. Considering that the cyanostar's LUMO (−3.97 eV) is higher than PM6's HOMO (−5.42 eV), the doping mechanism should be classified into the formation of the charge-transfer complex.51,76,77 The molecular doping has demonstrated its capability in promoting charge carrier transport. Thus, the carrier mobility was characterized by the space-charge limited current (SCLC) model, which is shown in Fig. S8 and Table S1.† Compared to the neat PM6 film (4.65 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1), the blend film PM6 + CS exhibited over 3-fold bigger hole mobility (1.61 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1). However, the addition of cyanostar was detrimental to the electron mobility of Y6-based films, 2.27 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 (neat Y6) vs. 1.54 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 (Y6 + CS), which is related to the unfavorable morphology discussed in the following section.
Photovoltaic properties
Inspired by the established interaction of cyanostar with PM6 and PEDOT:PSS, the OSC devices involving these materials were fabricated to investigate the diversity of photovoltaic properties. The devices employed a conventional configuration of indium tin oxide (ITO)/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/PDINO/silver (Ag). It is worth noting that PM6 rather than Y6 could be doped by cyanostar, and the literature has already revealed that the distribution of the extra component is crucial to affect the morphology and electronic properties of the relevant devices.40 Therefore, the active layer was fabricated by sequential deposition, i.e. the PM6 solution in chlorobenzene was cast on top of PEDOT:PSS followed by the deposition of Y6 dissolved in chloroform. The previous reports have demonstrated that the architecture of the active layer prepared by sequential deposition with non-orthogonal solvents is pseudo-bilayer owing to the dissolution of the underlying layer in the second solution process,78–82 which is also verified by the following study in this work.
After meticulous optimization of the processing conditions detailed in Table S2 of ESI†, the reference device PM6/Y6 shows a decent power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 16.59%, which is consistent with the reported results. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves and photovoltaic parameters of optimal devices are summarized in Fig. 3a and Table 1. Then, cyanostar was added into the PM6 solution with varied weight ratios from 1% to 5% to prepare the underlying layer, followed by the spin-cast of Y6. As shown in Table S3,† the photovoltaic property of the device PM6 + CS/Y6 is visibly superior due to the synergic enhancements of Voc, Jsc and FF. With 3% cyanostar, the Jsc raises to be 26.09 mA cm−2, providing the best PCE of 17.43%. When further elevating the content of cyanostar to be 5%, the PCE (17.01%) of the relevant device started to decline although the value was still higher than that of the control device PM6/Y6. Compared to the existing dopants, which are only effective at ultralow concentrations, the device performance is less sensitive to the content of cyanostar. This might be rationalized by the unique merit of cyanostar. First, cyanostar has better miscibility than other dopants to prevent the large-scale phase separation. Second, the p-doping by cyanostar is categorized as the formation of charge-transfer complex, so that the electronic structure of doped materials is only tuned temperately. Similar attempts were devoted to the preparation of device PM6/Y6 + CS by mixing Y6 and cyanostar with varied weight ratios and then coating on top of the pre-prepared PM6 layer. It is reasonably speculated that the p-doping should also occur in PM/Y6 + CS, since Y6 and cyanostar can percolate into the underlying PM6 layer to form a pseudo-bilayer structure. However, the overall photovoltaic performance of the device PM6/Y6 + CS is deteriorated even with a small amount (1%) of cyanostar. With the increase in the content of cyanostar to be 3% and 5%, the Jsc and Voc are further decreased, leading to inferior PCEs of 16.06% and 15.79% respectively. The sharp contrast between devices PM6 + CS/Y6 and PM6/Y6 + CS suggests that the distribution of cyanostar somehow plays a pivotal role, which will be discussed in the following sections.

The promising adjustment of the active layer encouraged us to explore the application of cyanostar in interfacial modification while retaining the p-doping of the active layer as well. Thus, the probability of synergistically optimizing the active layer and interface was attempted by designing a new device denoted as CS/PM6/Y6. By spin-coating the cyanostar atop PEDOT:PSS, a small amount of cyanostar will percolate into the underlying PEDOT:PSS layer, while a thin film of cyanostar is formed on the surface. Then, the PM6 solution is deposited, obtaining a mixture film of PM6 and cyanostar due to the erosion of cyanostar by chlorobenzene. Meanwhile, a thin layer enriched with cyanostar would be retained since the solution-processing deposition only takes a few seconds. Through carefully regulating the thickness of cyanostar by controlling the solution concentration and processing conditions (Table S3†), the interfacial layer enriched with cyanostar is supposed to be empirically tuned as around 10 nm. As expected, appreciable improvement with more than 17.7% PCEs is present in the CS/PM6/Y6-based devices with different contents of cyanostar. When the inserted cyanostar is cast from 3 mg mL−1 solution, Jsc reaches the maximum of 26.71 mA cm−2, providing the champion PCE of 17.98%, which is superior to the control device PM6/Y6 as well as other devices with different cyanostar distributions.
In comparison with the control device PM6/Y6, the addition of cyanostar induces a slight increase in Voc, owing to the p-doping of PM6 and PEDOT:PSS, which regulates the energy level alignment to decrease the energy loss (Fig. S5†). However, the change in Jsc is susceptible to the distribution of cyanostar, i.e. PM6 + CS/Y6 and CS/PM6/Y6-based devices achieve higher Jsc while lower Jsc appears in the device PM6/Y6 + CS. To elucidate the split trend of Jsc, external quantum efficiency (EQE) was characterized, as shown in Fig. 3b. With the device PM6/Y6 as reference, the EQE response of the entire spectra in CS/PM6/Y6 are obviously stronger, although they exhibit almost identical absorption spectra (Fig. S9†), indicating the efficient photon-to-current conversion in CS/PM6/Y6, which could be rationalized by the scenario that cyanostar fills the trap state to suppress the trap-assisted recombination.37,43 Similarly, improved spectral response is evident in the PM6 + CS/Y6-based device. Dramatically, the EQE response of PM6/Y6 + CS mainly declines below 650 nm, which is originated from the absorption of PM6 rather than Y6, implying that the second solution process deposition of Y6–cyanostar-mixed solution would bring a negative impact on the underlying PM6.
Charge transport and recombination
To understand the mechanism of charge dynamics in devices with different active layers, transient photovoltage (TPV) was first conducted to evaluate the carrier lifetimes. The voltage decay curves (Fig. 4a) illustrated the diversity of carrier lifetimes in varying devices, estimated as 1.02 μs (PM6/Y6), 1.11 μs (CS/PM6/Y6), 1.32 μs (PM6 + CS/Y6) and 0.822 μs (PM6/Y6 + CS), respectively. This result could be rationalized by that the trap state within the band gap would be filled by cyanostar to prolong the carrier lifetime in CS/PM6/Y6 and PM6 + CS/Y6, while cyanostar could not dope Y6 but perform as impurity to create new defect in PM6/Y6 + CS. Furthermore, the charge transport was investigated by SCLC measurement. The data are summarized in Table 2 and Fig. S10.† As a well-known efficient system, the control device PM6/Y6 realizes decent holes (5.24 × 10−4 cm−2 V−1 s−1) and electrons (1.46 × 10−3 cm−2 V−1 s−1) mobilities. When cyanostar is mixed with PM6, the hole mobility of the PM6 + CS/Y6 blend film raises to be 7.92 × 10−4 cm−2 V−1 s−1, while the electron mobility (1.78 × 10−3 cm−2 V−1 s−1) is also slightly increased. However, the charge mobility is significantly susceptible to the distribution of cyanostar. Alternating the deposition sequence of cyanostar renders the decline of both hole (2.42 × 10−4 cm−2 V−1 s−1) and electron (1.07 × 10−3 cm−2 V−1 s−1) mobilities in the device PM6/Y6 + CS. In particular, the hole mobility that relies on the transporting pathway built by PM6 reduces by half compared to the device PM6/Y6, indicating the addition of cyanostar into Y6 synergistically affects the underlying PM6, which is consistent with the trend of EQE response. The device CS/PM6/Y6 displays the highest hole (8.55 × 10−4 cm−2 V−1 s−1) and electron (1.83 × 10−3 cm−2 V−1 s−1) mobilities among these devices, contributing to the enhancement of Jsc and FF.

To further understand the detailed charge recombination, the dependence of Jsc and Voc on the light intensity (Plight) was further studied. As shown in Fig. 4b, the light intensity dependence of Voc was employed to investigate the trap-assisted recombination in the devices. Theoretically, Voc linearly correlates with nkTln(Plight)/q, where n, k, T and q are the scaling factor, Boltzmann constant, Kelvin temperature, and elementary charge, respectively. The value of n usually ranges from 1 to 2, indicating that the trap-assisted recombination deteriorates from negligible to a dominant situation. The corresponding scaling factors were calculated to be 1.07 (PM6/Y6), 1.03 (CS/PM6/Y6), 1.05 (PM6 + CS/Y6) and 1.08 (PM6/Y6 + CS), respectively. The result indicates that the trap-assisted recombination is significantly suppressed in the control device PM6/Y6, while the effectiveness would change with the addition of cyanostar, being mitigated or deteriorated depending on the distribution of cyanostar, i.e. to introduce cyanostar into PM6 and the hole-transporting interface is prone to suppress the trap-assisted charge recombination attributed to the filled trap state but mixing cyanostar and Y6 is detrimental to the trap-assisted charge recombination. The bimolecular recombination was investigated as well. Based on the power-law equation Jsc ∝ Plightα, where the value of α, deviating from unity, reflects the deterioration of bimolecular recombination. The Jscversus Plight curves in Fig. 4c show that the exponential factors of the devices PM6/Y6, CS/PM6/Y6, PM6 + CS/Y6 and PM6/Y6 + CS are 0.995, 0.998, 0.996 and 0.994 respectively, demonstrating that the tendency of bimolecular recombination is similar to that of the trap-assisted recombination.
Based on the aforementioned data, it is clear that cyanostar impacts the charge transport and recombination in different ways depending on the distribution, in which locating in PM6 or PEDOT:PSS has positive effects but blending cyanostar and Y6 is unfavorable for charge transport and recombination, eventually leading to different Jsc and FF. This diversity is intrinsically originated from the p-doping by cyanostar and its potential influence on morphology.
Microstructure and morphology
To study the effect of cyanostar on the morphology and microstructure of varying devices, AFM, TEM and GIWAXS were characterized. As shown in Fig. 5a, the PM6/Y6 blend film prepared by sequential deposition shows a fiber-like network, which is also evident in the PM6 + Y6 blend film (Fig. S11†) fabricated by the mixed solution of PM6 and Y6, indicating that the sequential deposition also enables the formation of the interpenetrating donor/acceptor network. Notably, the RMS of the PM6/Y6 film (1.33 nm) is bigger than that of the PM6 + Y6 film (0.984 nm), implying that the sequential deposition is prone to enhance the phase separation. When cyanostar is introduced as an additive, the larger RMS (1.33 nm) and sharp grain boundary, compared to the control sample PM6/Y6, demonstrates the enhanced phase separation and less amorphous phase in the PM6 + CS/Y6 film. Dramatically, the film CS/PM6/Y6, in which PM6 and Y6 are sequential cast atop a thin layer of cyanostar, exhibits a similar surface morphology with the same RMS with the PM6 + CS/Y6 film, suggesting cyanostar has redissolved and then diffused into PM6 during the solution-process of PM6. When cyanostar was co-deposited with Y6, the PM6/Y6 + CS film is rougher with a RMS of 1.43 nm, indicating the strongest phase separation among these blend films. In the TEM images (Fig. S12†), the introduction of cyanostar makes the fiber-like structure in the CS/PM6/Y6 blend film more clear, which is well consistent with the tendency of AFM images.

GIWAXS was further performed to investigate the microstructure. First, the neat films of PM6 and Y6 were characterized in order to distinguish the signal origination. As illustrated in Fig. S13,† the neat Y6 film displays an intensive peak at 1.73 Å−1 along the out-of-plane (OOP) direction, corresponding to the face-on π–π stacking with a distance of 3.63 Å, while the signal that originated from the packing of alkyl chains in Y6 is indistinct. On the contrary, a strong lamellar packing peak of PM6 is evident at around 0.335 Å−1 (d = 18.7 Å) along OOP, but a subtle peak at 1.64 Å−1 (d = 3.83 Å) along OOP corresponding to π–π stacking is present, as shown in Fig. S14.† Although the scattering signal, in particular the one along the in-plane (IP) direction, is relatively weak due to the inherent disadvantages of the synchrotron facility, the features of Y6 and PM6 are in good agreement with those previously reported in the literature,11 verifying the reliability of GIWAXS data obtained in this contribution. As for the blend films (Fig. 5b, c and Table 3), the PM6/Y6 film exhibits two peaks at 1.73 Å−1 (d = 3.63 Å) and 0.312 Å−1 (d = 20.1 Å) along the OOP direction, assigned to the π–π stacking of Y6 and the lamellar packing of PM6 respectively. Notably, the d-spacing of PM6's lamellar packing in the blend film is bigger than that of the neat film (18.7 Å), suggesting that the packing order of PM6 seems to be declined in the blend film. With the introduction of cyanostar, the π–π stacking peak of Y6 remained almost identical at around 1.73 Å−1 along OOP no matter where cyanostar locates. However, the peak that originated from PM6's lamellar packing exhibits a dependence on the distribution of cyanostar. When cyanostar is simultaneously deposited with Y6, the lamellar packing of PM6 becomes loose with a larger d-spacing (q = 0.308 Å−1, d = 20.4 Å) in the blend film PM6/Y6 + CS. As cyanostar locating in PM6 or the interface between PM6 and PEDOT:PSS, more tight lamellar packing is evident in the blend films of PM6 + CS/Y6 (q = 0.336 Å−1, d = 18.7 Å) and CS/PM6/Y6 (q = 0.328 Å−1, d = 19.1 Å). Meanwhile, the crystal coherence lengths (CCLs) of Y6's π–π stacking and PM6's lamellar packing are in the sequence PM6/Y6 + CS < PM6/Y6 < CS/PM6/Y6 < PM6 + CS/Y6. The tendency is perfectly accordant with the carrier transporting properties, i.e. the highly ordered packing of PM6 endows the devices PM6 + CS/Y6 and CS/PM6/Y6 with higher hole mobility.

Mechanism and universality
The aforementioned results have demonstrated that cyanostar could be utilized as a p-dopant to simultaneously modify PEDOT:PSS and active layers, thus positively or negatively affecting the device performance depending on the distribution in the active layer. However, the inherent mechanism of this diversity is unrevealed.
Secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS) was performed to clarify the accurate distribution of cyanostar, in particular for the case of CS/PM6/Y6, wherein the underlying cyanostar layer might be eroded and then diffuse into the active layer during the solution-process deposition of PM6 and Y6. Unfortunately, there is no unique element or functional group in cyanostar, which differs from those of PM6 and Y6. However, the vertical distribution of cyanostar is able to be visualized by synergistically analyzing the features of the elements and cyano group. As shown in Fig. S15,† the signal of sulfur is evident in the entire sputtering process (∼600 s), while the content of fluorine starts to decline from around 360 s. Given that all of PM6, Y6 and PEDOT:PSS contain sulfur but only PM6 and Y6 possess fluorine, it could be concluded the initial 360 s sputtering is working on the active layer. Among all the blend films, the signal of cyano group (Fig. 6a) is intensive until the sputtering time exceeded 360 s, suggesting the cyano group is distributed in the whole active layer. Since the cyano group is absent in PM6, this result also verifies that the sequential deposition constructs an interpenetrating donor/acceptor architecture. Notably, the amount of cyano groups gradually decreases in the active layer, revealing that the sequential deposition efficiently tunes the vertical distribution of PM6 and Y6, i.e. Y6 and PM6 are enriched on the top and bottom of the active layer respectively, which is beneficial for the charge extraction in OSCs with conventional configuration. The cyano group is also present in cyanostar, but the addition of cyanostar (3%, w/w) is too small to change the signal intensity of the cyano group. However, cyanostar is mixed with PM6 or Y6 in a solution and then co-deposited, and hence, it is reasonably speculated that the distribution of cyanostar has a similar tendency with PM6 and Y6, i.e. more cyanostar located at the bottom in the device PM6 + CS/Y6 and on the top in the device PM6/Y6 + CS, respectively. More importantly, an obviously stronger signal of the cyano group (Fig. 6a) is evident at 310–360 s in the device CS/PM6/CS, indicating that high concentrations of cyanostar appear in this region. Therefore, the vertical distribution of components in the champion device CS/PM6/Y6 is clarified. Due to the interaction with PSS and the solubility in chlorobenzene, cyanostar would partially percolate into PEDOT:PSS and PM6, consequently changing their electronic properties via p-doping. Meanwhile, a thin layer enriched with cyanostar located between PEDOT:PSS and PM6, which can modify the interface to promote the carrier extraction and suppress the charge recombination.
 Fig. 6  (a) The CN signal from TOF-SIMS of CS/PM6/Y6, PM6 + CS/Y6, and PM6/Y6 + CS blend films, (b) 1D cutline profiles of GIWAXS based on Y6, Y6 + CS, PM6, CS/PM6, and PM6 + CS films, and (c) photoluminescence of Y6 neat film, PM6/Y6, CS/PM6/Y6, PM6 + CS/Y6, PM6/Y6 + CS blend films. 
Although the p-doping should also occur in PM/Y6 + CS due to the formation of pseudo-bilayers, the photovoltaic property is even poorer than the control sample PM6/Y6, suggesting the existence of other factors, affecting the device performance, which might be related to the morphology. The aforementioned AFM images have already revealed a stronger phase separation in the blend film PM/Y6 + CS, in which PM6 exhibits relatively low crystallinity demonstrated by the GIWAXS. To deeply understand the diversity, the morphological characteristics of the CS/PM6, PM6 + CS and Y6 + CS films were measured. As displayed in the AFM images (Fig. S16†), the surface features of CS/PM6 and PM6 + CS are almost identical with that of PM6, suggesting that the addition of cyanostar would not destroy the original packing of PM6. On the contrast, significantly difference is observed between Y6 and Y6 + CS, as shown in Fig. S17.† The as-cast Y6 film shows a coarse surface with a RMS of 4.06 nm, and the Y6 + CS film dramatically exhibited a smooth topography with a smaller RMS of 0.998 nm. The GIWAXS data (Fig. 6b) further confirm the different effects of cyanostar. The intensity of scattering signals at 0.335 Å−1 and 1.63 Å−1 along OOP assigned to the lamellar packing and the π–π stacking of PM6 in CS/PM6 and PM6 + CS-based films are obviously stronger than those of the PM6 neat film, indicating that cyanostar enhances the crystallinity of PM6. However, the addition of cyanostar would decrease the packing order of Y6 demonstrated by the declined scattering peak (1.73 Å−1) originating from the π–π stacking of Y6. This split trend might result from the miscibility. Thus, the surface characteristics of blend films were conducted. Based on the contact angle and surface energy properties, the miscibility could be quantitatively evaluated by the interaction parameter χ, which is calculated from the equation .83 The smaller χ indicates the enhanced miscibility. As shown in Fig. S18, Tables S4 and S5,† the combination PM6:Y6 shows a moderate χ value (0.343), rationalizing the balance of miscibility and phase separation in this efficient system. A slightly bigger χ value (0.386) is estimated for PM6:CS, explaining a similar surface topography in the AFM images of the neat PM6 film and the blend PM6 + CS film. However, the combination Y6:CS shows an extremely small χ value of 0.001. This overwhelming miscibility of these two materials would substantially damage the origin packing of Y6, as demonstrated in the AFM and GIWAXS of Y6 + CS. When cyanostar is added into PM6, the surface tensions decreased, leading to a bigger but still reasonable χ value (0.448) for PM6 + CS:Y6. Dramatically, the χ value for PM6:Y6 + CS vigorously increases to be 0.948, suggesting the mixture solution of Y6 and cyanostar might be less miscible with the underlying PM6 layer during the sequential deposition.
Based on these results, the relationship between the distribution of cyanostar and the photovoltaic properties is visualized. In the device CS/PM6/Y6, cyanostar would partially percolate into the underlying PEDOT:PSS, while an enriched cyanostar layer is retained, which consequently downshifted the work function to relieve the charge-transfer barrier and enhance the Voc. More importantly, the doping effect induced by cyanostar regulates the electronic properties of PM6, consequently increasing the carrier lifetime, promoting the charge transport and suppressing the charge recombination. As for the morphology, the diffusion of cyanostar into PM6 somehow enhances the crystallinity of PM6 (Fig. 6b), owing to the increase in intermolecular interaction originating from the doping-induced dipole.40 In addition, the existence of cyanostar in PM6 negligibly affects the miscibility of PM6 + CS and Y6 for the sequential deposition. Thus, compared to the control device PM6/Y6, the morphology of CS/PM6/Y6 is more close to the ideal active layer with highly packing-ordered PM6 and Y6. These merits eventually endow the device CS/PM6/Y6 with the best photovoltaic performance. As for the device PM6 + CS/Y6, cyanostar influences the blend film in a similar way except the effect on PEDOT:PSS, so that an obvious improvement of device performance is achieved.
In the case of PM6/Y6 + CS, the extremely high miscibility of Y6 and cyanostar significantly damages the original packing Y6, as demonstrated by AFM and GIWAXS. Meanwhile, to introduce cyanostar into Y6 causes the decreased miscibility with the underlying PM6 layer verified by the large χ value of 0.948, leading to an unfavorable microstructure with severe phase separation and inadequate donor–acceptor interface. Thus, the photon-generated exciton could not be dissociated efficiently, as demonstrated by the photoluminescence quenching experiment (Fig. 6c), wherein the fluorescence of Y6 is appreciably quenched except the film PM6/Y6 + CS. Meanwhile, the lack of bicontinuous donor–acceptor network resulting from the low miscibility of PM6 and Y6 + CS restrains the carrier transporting of both electrons and holes. In addition, with more cyanostar distributing in Y6 rather than PM6, the p-doping becomes less effective to cause the increase in charge recombination. Consequently, the photovoltaic properties of the device PM6/Y6 + CS are even worse than those of the control device PM6/Y6.
To evaluate the universality, other device architectures and photovoltaic materials were attempted. As summarized in Tables S6 and S7,† cyanostar was previously mixed with PM6 and Y6 in solution to fabricate bulk-heterojunctions with conventional or inverted configurations. The devices with cyanostar show the PCEs of 15.50% (conventional) and 15.21% (inverted) respectively, which are superior to that of the control devices. As illustrated in Fig. S19, S20 and Table S8,† the inserted cyanostar layer improves the photovoltaic performance in devices with varying donor–acceptor combinations of PM6/IT4F,84 PBDB-T/N2200,85 PTB7-Th/6TIC and PTB7-Th/6T4F.86 Considering the structural diversity of these materials, the effect of morphology modification for individual systems might be different even converse. Therefore, the improvement of device performance is mainly driven by p-doping induced by cyanostar, which was verified by the ESR spectra (Fig. S21†). In addition, the effect of cyanostar on device stability is negligible (Fig. S22†).
Conclusions
In conclusion, a conjugated macrocycle cyanostar has been first utilized in the OSCs to simultaneously optimize the hole-transporting layer and active layer. Through the sequential deposition procedure, a layer enriched with cyanostar was inserted as the interface, wherein cyanostar would partially percolate into the underlying PEDOT:PSS and the upper active layer. By taking advantage of the positively charged hydrogen, cyanostar is able to interact with the anion in PEDOT:PSS and then tune the electronic properties, consequently leading to a downshifted work function to facilitate the charge extraction and raise the Voc. Moreover, cyanostar could p-dope PM6 by forming a charge-transfer complex. This p-doping is beneficial for prolonging carrier lifetime, promoting charge transport and suppressing charge recombination. In addition, the morphology of the active layer exhibits a dependence on the distribution of cyanostar. Mixing cyanostar with PM6 could enhance the packing order of PM6 and negligibly affect the following deposition of Y6, consequently improving the morphology of the CS/PM6/Y6 and PM6 + CS/Y6 devices. However, the extremely high miscibility between Y6 and cyanostar deteriorates the original packing of Y6 and prevents the compatibility of PM6 and Y6 in the PM6/Y6 + CS device, eventually providing an unfavorable active layer with large-scale phase separation and inadequate donor–acceptor interface. Based on synergic effects of the versatile p-dopant, the device CS/PM6/Y6 achieves a champion PCE of 17.98%. This robust method is less sensitive to the content of cyanostar. Furthermore, the p-doping induced by cyanostar is applicable in varying photovoltaic materials, showing a prominent universality. This strategy, to synergistically optimizing the active layer and interface, is able to facilitate the device fabrication and shows great potentials in practical manufacturing. This work also paves the way to employ conjugated macrocycles as versatile additives in organic electronics.
