    , Accepted 27th June 2016First published on 28th June 2016AbstractThe development of a highly efficient stretchable counter electrode (CE) for quantum dot sensitized solar cells (QDSCs) is still challenging. In this work, a flexible Cu/Ni film has been pre-prepared via a novel redox reaction between Ni foam and Cu ions. Further, a flexible Cu2S/Ni CE was fabricated for the first time by sulfidation of the Cu/Ni film. A high photovoltaic conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.94% for a model CdSeTe QDSC composed of the flexible Cu2S/Ni CE and a glass based photoanode was obtained, with the performance being strongly attributed to the excellent catalytic activity, high conductivity and good adhesion between Cu2S and Ni foam. Furthermore, flexible photovoltaic devices constructed using the as-prepared bendable Cu2S/Ni CE as well as a TiO2 based plastic photoanode have also been assembled with the highest PCE of 3.55%. Satisfactory mechanical properties and stability after repeated bending have also been achieved.
Introduction
Quantum dot sensitized solar cells (QDSCs) have attracted extensive interest in both academic and industrial fields recently due to their relatively low cost, high power conversion efficiency (PCE), ease of fabrication and broad application prospects.1–6 QDSC devices are configured with a photoanode based on a QD-loaded mesoporous TiO2 film, an electrolyte and a counter electrode (CE). Encouragingly, the record PCE up to 11.6% has been achieved recently.7 As a crucial component in QDSCs, the CE collects electrons from the external circuit and catalyzes the reduction of Sn2− to S2− at the CE/electrolyte interface. Therefore, a high electrical conductivity for electron collection, a large specific surface area for electrolyte adsorption and a high catalytic activity for the reduction of Sn2− are supposed to be preferred characteristics for the desired CE in QDSCs.8–11
Currently, the most widely used CEs in high efficiency QDSCs are brass foil and FTO (fluorine-doped SnO2) glass supported copper sulfide (CuxS) because of their superior catalytic activity.12–14 The brass foil based CEs (Cu2S/brass) have the advantages of high catalytic activity, high conductivity and flexibility which may have potential applications in flexible QDSCs. However, Cu2S/brass CEs suffer from continuous corrosion of the brass substrate by polysulfide electrolyte, leading to mechanical instability of the electrode and leakage of the electrolyte.8,12 The FTO supported CuxS (CuxS/FTO) is limited by the relatively poor conductivity which reduces the fill factor (FF) and PCE of the QDSCs due to the larger internal series resistance (Rs).13,14 Meanwhile, the rigid and fragile FTO glass restricts the potential application of flexible QDSCs in many fields, such as wearable devices. Therefore, an inexpensive and high performance flexible substitute supported CuxS CE is highly desirable. So far, suitable candidates for flexible CEs such as polyethylene naphthalate (PEN)/indium-tin-oxide (ITO) polymer substrates, graphite papers, and carbon fibers have been commonly used in flexible QDSCs. However, the efficiencies obtained from most flexible devices lagged behind those of the counterparts based on brass foil or FTO substrates.15–18 Metal sheets or foils have also been widely implemented in CEs due to their excellent electrical conductivity.19–22 As an inexpensive and excellent conductor, Ni foam has been used as one of the best electrode materials to assemble superior lithium storage and nickel hydrogen batteries.23,24 Particularly, Ni foam is inactive in polysulfide electrolyte and has a three-dimensional network structure contributing to its high specific surface area.23 Fang et al. applied CEs composed of NiS nanowall networks on Ni foam by a hydrothermal method to dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs), and the assembled device showed a higher PCE of 8.55% than that with the NiS/FTO CE (7.47%) and Pt CE (7.99%).25 Unfortunately a piece of rigid glass sheet was covered on the back of the prepared NiS/Ni CEs to avoid the leakage of the electrolyte. Geng et al. fabricated FeS/Ni foam CEs for CdS/CdSe QDSCs by electrochemical deposition and acquired a PCE of 4.39%.26 Although Ni foam based flexible CEs were used in DSCs and QDSCs, rigid FTO based photoanodes have still been applied in these devices. Moreover, FeS and NiS commonly showed lower catalytic activity than CuxS when used as CEs for QDSCs.27–29 Therefore, the strategy of replacing brass with three-dimensional network structured Ni foam followed by in situ growth of highly catalytic Cu2S on foam might produce high performance flexible CEs with both high conductivity and catalytic activity, resulting in the hindered corrosion and leakage of the electrolyte.
On the other hand, for the development of flexible QDSCs, the fabrication of flexible photoanodes has also been a highlighted and ongoing challenge, which has attracted much interest.18,30,31 Meng and co-workers first developed highly efficient flexible photoanodes through transferring a pre-prepared TiO2 porous layer to indium tin oxides–polyethylene terephthalate (ITO–PET), resulting in an efficiency of 3.47% for CdS/CdSe QDSCs using the Cu2S/brass CE.30 A similar efficiency of 3.4% based on flexible CdS/CdSe QDSC photoanodes (with the Cu2S/brass CE) has also been obtained in which ZnO nanosheets were first prepared on woven titanium wires via a two-step chemical method for the adsorption of sensitizers.19 ZnO nanorod arrays have been fabricated on a flexible ITO/PET substrate by a hydrothermal method to anchor CdS/CdSe QDs. The resultant photoanodes were assembled with CoS array/graphite paper as the CE. Finally, an efficiency of 2.7% was obtained.31 The synthesis procedure reported for flexible photoanodes seemed to be complex and technical. Simultaneously, ZnO nanosheets or nanorods showed a lower surface area than mesoporous TiO2, thereby leading to a low loading of QDs and low efficiency. Thus, the preparation of mesoporous TiO2 based flexible photoanodes via a simple screen-printing or doctor-blade method at low temperature is an effective route and still it is challenging to obtain highly efficient flexible QDSCs.32,33
Here, we have developed a novel and efficient method for preparing flexible Cu2S/Ni foam (or Cu2S/Ni for simplicity) CEs through the sulfidation of Cu/Ni foam which was first hydrothermally fabricated via a redox reaction between Ni foam and Cu ions. A model CdSeTe QDSC constructed with a conventional FTO based TiO2 photoanode was studied to optimize the experimental conditions for preparing the CEs and to evaluate the performance of the resultant CEs. The obtained PCE of 8.94% is higher than that of cells assembled with both Cu2S/FTO (8.39%) and NiS/Ni foam CEs (6.28%) and comparable with that of Cu2S/brass CE (9.11%). Meanwhile, flexible photoanodes based on mesoporous TiO2 on a PEN/ITO substrate has also been manufactured to assemble flexible CdSe QDSCs with the highest efficiency of 3.55% reported to date. The resultant flexible devices presented satisfactory mechanical properties and stability after several hundreds of bending cycles, indicating a great improvement in potential applications of flexible QDSCs in stretchable and wearable photovoltaic textiles.
Experimental section
Preparation of CEs
Ni foam (2*2 cm2 square) was immersed in a 0.1 M NaOH aqueous solution for 30 min and dried to remove impurities. A Ni foam supported Cu2S (Cu2S/Ni) CE was easily fabricated by putting 20 mL of 0.02 M CuSO4 aqueous solution together with the cleaned Ni foam into a 50 mL Teflon-lined autoclave directly. The autoclave was sealed and heated at 150 °C for 5 h. The obtained brownish film was dried at 60 °C overnight in air after the autoclave was cooled to room temperature. The Cu2S/Ni CE was obtained by immersing the pre-prepared Cu/Ni film in a polysulfide solution containing 2.0 M Na2S and 2.0 M S for 2 min. Finally, to prevent the leakage of the electrolyte, the Cu2S/Ni CE was covered with a piece of tin foil followed by leveling off under a pressure of 6 MPa. As a comparison, an FTO supported Cu2S (Cu2S/FTO) CE was prepared by electrodeposition of the Cu film on FTO glass followed by sulfidation to form the Cu2S film according to a literature method.12 Meanwhile, a Ni foam supported NiS (NiS/Ni) CE was prepared by putting 0.03 g of sulfur powder, 20 mL of ethanol, and Ni foam into a 50 mL Teflon-lined autoclave directly. The autoclave was heated overnight at 130 °C and then dried at 60 °C in air.25
Fabrication of flexible photoanodes and assembling of flexible QDSCs
For preparing the mesoporous TiO2 paste, an amount of 0.2 g of P25 nanoparticles and 0.1 mL of TiO2-sol (synthesis method shown in the ESI†) with 1.0 mL binder solution (shown in the ESI†) were dispersed in 6.0 mL of anhydrous ethanol and sonicated for 30 min followed by evaporating to achieve the final paste.34 The obtained TiO2 paste was coated onto well-cleaned PEN/ITO substrates by the doctor-blade technique and then dried overnight at 120 °C in an oven for preparing the flexible photoanode. The thickness of the TiO2 mesoporous film was controlled to be around 10 ± 0.2 μm. The obtained flexible film was soaked in aqueous CdSe QD solution for 2 h and alternatively immersed in Zn(OA)2 and Na2S aqueous solutions for 4 cycles with 1 min/dip followed by rinsing with water and ethanol sequentially. The gel polysulfide electrolyte was prepared by adding 0.4 g of sodium polyacrylate into 10 mL polysulfide electrolyte (2.0 M Na2S and S aqueous solution) under stirring for 10 min.35 Finally, the sandwich-type cell was assembled by sealing the Cu2S/Ni CE and flexible photoanode using a 60 μm thick plastic spacer (DuPont), and the gel polysulfide electrolyte was then filled. The CdSeTe sensitized photoanodes based on the FTO substrates were used as a model to optimize the CEs and the detailed assembly procedures of CdSeTe QDSCs are described in the ESI.†36–38
Characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed on a Siemens D5005 X-ray powder diffractometer using Cu Kα as the radiation source. The morphology of Cu2S/Ni CEs was observed with a field emission scanning electron microscope (SEM, FEI NOVA Nano SEM450). The chemical composition of copper sulfide was determined by inductively coupled plasma spectroscopy (ICP) (Agilent 725 ES). J–V curves of QDSCs were measured with a Keithley 2400 source meter illuminated under an AM 1.5 G spectrum from a solar simulator (Oriel, Model No. 94022A). The light intensity was calibrated to 100 mW cm−2 with the use of a NREL Si solar reference cell. A photoactive area of 0.236 cm2 was defined by a black metal mask. Incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) curves were obtained on a Keithley 2000 multimeter under the illumination of a 300 W tungsten lamp with a Spectral DK240 monochromator. EIS and Tafel polarization measurements were performed on an impedance analyzer (Zahner, Zennium) under dark conditions using sandwiched cells composed of two identical CEs placed face to face and the gel polysulfide electrolyte between them. The scan frequency for EIS measurements ranged from 100 mHz to 100 kHz, and the amplitude was set to 10 mV. The active area of the studied CEs is 0.36 cm2. For each kind of QDSC, five or three cells with the same CE were prepared and evaluated in parallel in one batch.
Results and discussion
Formation and structure of Cu2S/Ni CEs
The Cu2S/Ni CE for QDSCs was fabricated through a two-step simple method and the schematic description is presented in Fig. 1. A Cu/Ni film was first fabricated through a hydrothermal reaction between Ni foam and copper ions by soaking the Ni foam into copper sulfate aqueous solution. Then the as-prepared brick red Cu/Ni film was immersed into a polysulfide electrolyte solution for sulfidation to form Cu2S/Ni CEs. The standard potential of the Cu2+/Cu pair (0.3419 V vs. SHE) is higher than that of the Ni2+/Ni pair (−0.257 V vs. SHE), indicating that the redox reaction could occur according to the following reaction: Ni + CuSO4 = NiSO4 + Cu. Thus, partial Ni was sacrificed and Cu ions were reduced to Cu nanostructures simultaneously on Ni foam in the presence of an appropriate amount of copper sulfate. The formation of copper could be apparently confirmed by the color change from dark gray to brick red. The crystal structure of the sample has also been characterized by XRD with the pattern shown in Fig. 2a, in which the newly appeared diffraction peaks centered at 37.4° and 45.8° could be indexed to the (102) and (110) facets corresponding to hexagonal Cu2S (JCPDS file no. 26-1116). It could be seen from the XRD pattern that the unreacted Ni foam was still predominant in the final Cu2S/Ni CE after the sulfidation of the Cu/Ni film because of the inactivity of Ni in polysulfide electrolyte. When the source of Ni foam was dipped into polysulfide electrolyte for the same time, nearly no S (from ICP results) was detected, further indicating the inactivity of Ni. Fig. 2b shows the SEM image of the Cu/Ni film. It could be seen that the film was composed of independent copper nanocrystallites with diameters of 200–500 nm. The characteristics of flexibility could be apparently confirmed by bending as shown in Fig. 2c. No visible cracks could be seen after several hundred times of bending. After sulfidation, the Ni foam was uniformly covered by Cu2S nanoflakes as shown in Fig. 2d, a similar morphology to that in previous reports on Cu2S/FTO CEs.12,39 The digital photos of Ni foam before and after the hydrothermal reaction are shown in Fig. S1.†

Photovoltaic performance of flexible Cu2S/Ni CEs
To optimize the experimental conditions for preparing the CEs and to evaluate the performance of the resultant Cu2S/Ni CEs, a model CdSeTe QDSC constructed by a conventional FTO based TiO2 photoanode was studied. To compare the effects of the substrate and catalysts on the performance of cells, Ni foam and the Cu2S catalyst were individually replaced with FTO and NiS respectively, and Cu2S/FTO, NiS/Ni CEs were also prepared. Fig. 3a shows the J–V curves of QDSCs assembled with the three CEs, and the resultant photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. The QDSC based on the Cu2S/Ni CE exhibited a higher PCE of 8.94% than that of Cu2S/FTO (8.39%) and NiS/Ni (6.28%) CEs. For NiS/Ni, all the parameters were greatly smaller than those of the other two, indicating the poorer catalytic activity of NiS than that of Cu2S, consistent with that in previous work.29 Although the open circuit voltage (Voc) and current density (Jsc) were slightly lower, the FF of Cu2S/Ni was greatly larger than that of Cu2S/FTO. It changed from 0.615 to 0.679 with an ∼10% increase, resulting in an ∼6.5% increase in PCE. The results exhibit that the replacement of rigid FTO with flexible Ni foam can improve the cell efficiency especially the FF. It is satisfactory that the efficiency obtained from the cells assembled with the Cu2S/Ni CE can be comparable to that for conventional Cu2S/brass CEs with a PCE of 9.11%. The photocurrent response to incident light for CdSeTe QDSCs assembled with various CEs was analyzed by IPCE as shown in Fig. 3b. Compared with that of the NiS/Ni CE, IPCEs of the QDSCs containing Cu2S/Ni and Cu2S/FTO CEs were higher over the entire wavelength region, in good accordance with the observed Jsc as listed in J–V curves and Table 1. The Jsc from IPCE and J–V for different CEs could be found in Table S2 (ESI†). The significant IPCE enhancement of QDSCs fabricated with Cu2S/Ni and Cu2S/FTO CEs further indicated that a similar Cu2S nanoflake structure possesses better electrocatalytic activity in reducing Sn2− to S2− than that of NiS/Ni based CEs.

To interpret the catalytic behaviors of the CEs related to photovoltaic performances, EIS measurements were performed using dummy cells assembled with two identical electrodes and the Nyquist plots are presented in Fig. 3c. The equivalent circuit is shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†) and the parameters including series resistance (Rs), solid–solid charge transfer resistance (R1) and CE–electrolyte charge transfer resistance (Rct) are also listed in Table 1. The Rs comprises the bulk resistance of CE materials, the resistance of the substrate, and the contact resistance together. The R1 is commonly investigated to evaluate the contact degree of the substrate with catalytic materials and Rct is considered as an important parameter to determine the catalytic activity of CE catalysts toward the reduction of polysulfide species. Owing to the high conductivity of the porous Ni foam substrate, Cu2S/Ni and NiS/Ni CEs showed very low Rs values of only 0.28 and 0.25 Ω cm2 respectively, which are much smaller than that of the FTO substrate (∼11 Ω cm2). The 2R1 value (0.57 Ω cm2) of Cu2S/Ni was only half that of Cu2S/FTO and NiS/Ni, indicating the good contact between Cu2S and Ni foam. Furthermore, the 2Rct value of the Cu2S/Ni CE (1.79 Ω cm2) which is similar to that of the Cu2S/FTO CE (2.37 Ω cm2) was much smaller than that of the NiS/Ni CE (28.05 Ω cm2), thus demonstrating that Cu2S is much more effective in catalyzing the reduction of polysulfide than the NiS material. To further understand the electrocatalytic activity of the different CEs, Tafel measurements were carried out using the same symmetric cells with results shown in Fig. 3d. The Cu2S/Ni CE showed similar exchange current density (J0 = RT/nFRct) to Cu2S/FTO and significantly higher exchange current density than NiS/Ni CE, indicating the better catalytic activity of Cu2S than that of NiS. The results from EIS and Tafel are well consistent with the photovoltaic performances of the QDSCs using the three different CEs. Therefore, the replacement of FTO with the porous Ni foam as the CE substrate has greatly enhanced the electron collection from the external circuit and electron transport in the CE, paving an effective way for decreasing the series resistance and leading to the high FF. From the results, we can conclude that the flexible Cu2S/Ni CE shows greatly better electrocatalytic activity than NiS/Ni and comparable electrocatalytic activity with rigid Cu2S/FTO CE. The excellent performance of the Cu2S/Ni CE may be attributed to the in situ growth of Cu2S on Ni foam, the high conductivity and flexibility of Ni, the superior electrocatalytic activity of Cu2S nanostructures and the porous Ni foam network template with a high surface area.
Effects of Cu ion concentration on the flexible Cu2S/Ni CE performance
It is worth mentioning that the excellent photovoltaic performance of the resulting cell devices based on the Cu2S/Ni CE is heavily dependent on the concentration of CuSO4 aqueous solution during the redox reaction. The concentrations of 0.01, 0.02 and 0.03 M were selected to study the relationship of the amount of Cu2S and the cell performance. No obvious changes in the structure and morphology of the prepared nanoflake-like Cu2S film and Cu2S/Ni CE could be seen from the SEM images and digital photos shown in Fig. S4 and S5 (ESI†). However, the large difference of photovoltaic performance could be confirmed from J–V curves in Fig. 4a and the corresponding parameters in Table 2. It is clear that when the concentration was increased from 0.01 M to 0.02 M, the Jsc and FF values were greatly enhanced from 18.01 to 20.22 mA cm−2 and from 0.579 to 0.679 respectively, resulting in the highest PCE of 8.94% with a 34% increase. The possible reason for the improved performance is that when the concentration was higher, enough Cu and Cu2S formed, representing a larger amount of catalyst, thus leading to the higher Jsc and better catalytic activity. The reason could also be confirmed from the higher IPCE (Fig. 4b) and the lower 2Rct (1.79 Ω cm2, only ∼59% percentage of 3.04) extracted from EIS results (Fig. 4c). When the concentration was further increased to 0.03 M, the FF and PCE obviously decreased to 0.658 and 8.55% individually although with no changes in Voc and Jsc. In this case, excess Cu2S nanoflakes were grown on the Ni substrate and might agglomerate. But they hardly contributed to the catalytic activity. More importantly, the adhesion of the Cu2S catalyst on the surface of the substrate was not firm due to the overly sacrificed Ni foam. The resultant poor contact between the substrate and catalyst will cause a large interfacial transfer resistance which could be verified from the larger 2R1 value (0.79, ∼134% of 0.57 Ω cm2 for the other two cases) in Fig. 4c and Table 2. When the concentration was excessively increased to 0.05 M, the CE film could be not preserved after being ground by fingers, indicating the collapse of the Ni foam substrate.

Performance of flexible QDSCs
Based on the successful preparation and superior performance of our flexible Cu2S/Ni CEs, it appears likely that flexible TiO2 photoanode films will be developed and consequently achieve really flexible QDSCs will be achieved. First, flexible TiO2 based photoanodes were fabricated by depositing the home-made TiO2 paste on a PEN/ITO substrate at low temperature with the detailed process described in the Experimental section. The surface morphology of the flexible anode is displayed in Fig. 5a from which a smooth and crack-free film could be observed. Meanwhile, the high magnification SEM image in Fig. 5b exhibited that the film was composed of mesoporous and interconnected TiO2 nanoparticles that could allow the sensitizers to be effectively adsorbed with high coverage. Here, the addition of TiO2-sol into the paste could not only enhance the interconnection of P25 particles but also decrease the surface tension, hence decreasing film resistance, enabling fast charge transport, and increasing the robustness of the mesoporous TiO2 film.34,40,41 The assembled flexible CdSe QDSC is shown in Fig. 5c, in which the characteristics of flexibility could be clearly seen. The corresponding photovoltaic performance of the assembled flexible device is shown in Fig. 5d. An optimized PCE of 3.55% was obtained. To our knowledge, this is the highest efficiency of current flexible QDSCs.

The mechanical stability of the optimized flexible QDSC was also evaluated by recording J–V curves and the corresponding parameters after repeatedly bending the device with results shown in Fig. 6. The normalized Jsc, Voc, FF, and PCE demonstrated that the flexible device presented an excellent tolerance to bending tests after 180 bending cycles up to a bending radius of ∼15 mm. Due to the slow permeation of electrolytes into the mesoporous film, the PCE and Jsc of the flexible QDSC increased slowly before 40 cycles, while the Voc and the FF remained nearly constant. After about 100 bending cycles, the PCE showed no obvious decrease. The cell photovoltaic properties began to get slightly worse after 120 bending cycles, but the PCE still remained at ∼83%, mainly due to the reduction of Jsc and FF only by 6–7%. The decrease of the performance might be attributed to the presence of microcracks generated within the TiO2 photoanode and the Cu2S/Ni CEs as a consequence of the repeated bending.41 The mechanism and improvement should be further investigated in the future work. Satisfactorily, progress in the efficiency and technique of the flexible QDSCs has been made in this work.

Conclusions
In conclusion, a flexible Cu2S/Ni foam CE has been developed via a novel and efficient method in which Cu/Ni foam was first fabricated through a redox reaction between Ni and Cu ions followed by sulfidation. The high PCE up to 8.94% for CdSeTe QDSC assembled with the as-prepared flexible CEs and conventional glass based photoanodes demonstrated that the in situ growth of Cu2S via a redox reaction could improve the contact of Ni foam and the Cu2S catalyst, leading to a greatly increased FF which strongly contributes to the superior photovoltaic performance. Meanwhile, flexible photoanodes based on mesoporous TiO2 on a PEN/ITO substrate have also been manufactured and the assembled flexible CdSe QDSCs exhibited the highest efficiency of 3.55%. Furthermore, the flexible devices presented satisfactory mechanical properties and the PCE still remained at ∼83% after repeated bending. This work marks the progress in the efficiency and production techniques of flexible QDSCs and indicates their potential applications in stretchable and wearable photovoltaic textiles with ease of fabrication, large scale production and low cost.
