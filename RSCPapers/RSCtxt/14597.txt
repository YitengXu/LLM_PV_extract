    , Accepted 12th June 2014First published on 13th June 2014AbstractCoxMn3−xO4 nanorods and hollow octahedrons have been fabricated through a simple hydrothermal method without using any template or surfactant. The growth mechanism is studied by characterizing the intermediate products during the phase transformation. In this strategy, the MnO2 nanowire serves as the main precursor for the subsequent formation of CoxMn3−xO4 nanomaterials. A merged dissolution–recrystallization and the Kirkendall effect mechanism has been proposed based on SEM, TEM and XRD characterization of the intermediate. Enhanced specific capacitance (266.84 F g−1 at 5 mV s−1), and good cycle stability (remaining 80.214% after 1000 cycles) are observed in aqueous electrolytes, which could be ascribed to the high charge accommodation, small ion-transport resistance, and good electric conductivity.
1 Introduction
Due to increasing demand for energy and depletion of fossil fuels, the development of highly efficient energy storage devices has attracted considerable attention from scientific and technological researchers.1–3 Implementation of renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind energy, have partially alleviated the pressure on energy demand. Supercapacitors (SCs), also known as electrochemical capacitors, are considered highly efficient storage devices that could bridge the gap between batteries and conventional capacitors due to their high power density, long cycle life, fast charging efficiency, and environmental friendliness.4–7
Among the electrode materials with high energy and power densities, ruthenium oxide (RuO2), which has remarkably high specific capacitance, good proton conductivity, excellent electrochemical reversibility, high rate capability, and long cycle life, has been the most extensively electrode material. However, its lack of abundance, high prices and environmental harmfulness has made it necessary to identify alternative materials for practical applications. Manganese oxides have excellent physical and chemical properties under ambient conditions. In particular, the rich polymorphism and structural flexibility of these compounds make them a good candidate for supercapacitors because of their easy access, low cost, and environmentally friendly nature.8 Nevertheless, the poor electrical conductivity and significant degradation greatly restrained the realization of their high theoretical capacitances (a theoretical capacity up to 1300 F g−1), especially at high charge/discharge rates in electrochemical cycling, which restricts the research speed of manganese oxides.9
The fast development of multidimensional nanomaterials of controllable size, composition, and structure has opened up enormous possibilities for engineering electrode materials with enhanced performance. For example, hollow micro/nano-structured materials have been considered ideal platforms for application in electrochemical energy storage because of their novel interior geometry and shell functionality.10–14 This kind of structure has increased the contact area between the electrolyte and the active material, and reduced transport lengths for both mass and charge transport. As a result, much effort has been given to synthesize MnO2-based hollow materials and to develop a rational design to maximize their electrochemically active sites for redox reactions by obtaining “opened” structures to further increase their energy storage density.15–17
Moreover, the critical role that impurities/dopants play has stimulated research on the creation of highly conducting nanocrystals.18–21 Because impurities can be used to alter the properties of nanoscale materials in desirable and controllable ways, doped nanocrystals can address key problems in applications ranging from solar cells to bio-imaging. Highly functional mixed oxide nanocrystals will require improving synthetic control over dopant incorporation, optimizing their concentrations, and investigating the phenomena that emerge. However, to the best of our knowledge, the hollow structured mixed manganese oxides have not been used to date as electrode materials for supercapacitors.
In this work, a facile template-free method was developed to synthesise a hollow manganese oxide nanomaterial with tunable morphologies and compositions. Analysis of the intermediate products has proved that hydrothermal treatment of the Co-adsorbed MnO2 nanowires produced CoxMn3−xO4 nanorods and hollow octahedrons with tunable compositions. Electrochemical results show that both the energy and the power densities at high rate are greatly improved when the doped manganese oxides are used as the supercapacitor electrode material.
2 Experimental
2.1 Chemicals
All reagents, unless otherwise stated, were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Beijing Co. Ltd and used as received without further purification. Deionized water from a Milli-Q system was used throughout the experiments.
2.2 Material synthesis
For the synthesis of cobalt-doped MnO2 nanowires, MnCl2·4H2O (0.162 g) and CoCl2·6H2O (0.0685 g) were first dissolved in 30 mL of isopropanol with ultrasonication for 30 minutes. After the bright blue solution was heated to 83 °C in a circulating water condenser with vigorous stirring, 30 mL of aqueous KMnO4 solution (containing 0.09 g of KMnO4) was added rapidly. After refluxing for 30 minutes, the mixed product (Intermediate I) was centrifuged, and washed with water and ethanol several times. MnO2 nanowires were also prepared in a similar way except the addition of CoCl2·6H2O. For the synthesis of CoxMn3−xO4 nanorods and hollow octahedrons, the black slurry in the flask (Intermediate I) was transferred into a 50 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and maintained at 200 °C for 2.5 and 5 h, respectively. After cooling to room temperature, the product was washed several times by centrifugation.
2.3 Characterization
High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images were obtained using a JEM-2010F transmission electron microscope at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were obtained by employing a Hitachi S4800 cold field-emission scanning electron microscope (CFE-SEM). X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) pattern of the samples was obtained by a Rigaku X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku Goniometer PMG-A2, CN2155D2, wavelength = 0.15147 nm) with Cu Kα radiation.
2.4 Electrochemical measurements
All electrochemical experiments were carried out at room temperature using a single compartment, three-electrode cell. An Ag/AgCl electrode was used as the reference electrode, and a Pt wire as the auxiliary electrode. The working electrode was prepared by mixing the 80 wt% of the electro-active material, 10 wt% of carbon black, and 10 wt% of polytetrafluoroethylene emulsion (10%) to obtain well-dispersed ink samples, and then painted on the nickel foam (1 cm2) and dried at 60 °C for 12 h. Then, all electrodes were pressed into flakes under 10 MPa.
3 Results and discussion
3.1 Structural characterization
SEM images (Fig. 1A and B) show that octahedral manganese oxide particles are synthesized on a large scale and with high uniformity. The octahedrons are enclosed by well-organized facets with an average edge length of about 400 nm and an elongated 〈001〉 axe of about 800 nm. Detailed structural information is given by TEM and HRTEM images (Fig. 1C and D). The sharp contrast difference between the center and the edge proves their hollow nature with a wall thickness of about 30 to 50 nm. HRTEM image (Fig. 1D) indicates a typical tetragonal lattice structure, and the marked lattice fringes with a spacing of 0.55 and 0.27 nm, corresponding to the (202) and (311) lattice planes, respectively. Fig. 1E shows the typical XRD pattern of CoxMn3−xO4. All the diffraction peaks and the high intensity of these peaks indicated the high crystallinity and purity of the CoxMn3−xO4 product (JCPDS: 18-0410). The energy-dispersive spectrometry (EDS, Fig. 1F and G) result represents an averaged atomic percentage of Co of about 5.7% (Co0.4Mn2.6O4), which can be varied conveniently from 3.8% to 20.6% by changing the precursory cobalt concentrations.

3.2 Growth mechanism
It has been reported that the growth of nanocrystals is rooted in surface energies. The surface energies are usually associated with crystallographic planes and are different in a sequence of γ{111} > γ{100} > γ{110}. However, it has also been found that facet-matching may be another driving force for the formation of nanowalls and nanodisks.22–25 Herein, controlled experiments were carried out to investigate the formation of such hollow octahedrons.
As can be noted from the first step of the synthesis procedure, only MnCl2, KMnO4 and CoCl2 were dissolved and heated at 83 °C and a brown precipitate was obtained. SEM observation proved that ultrathin nanowires were synthesized without using any surfactant (Fig. 2A). XRD characterizations demonstrated the pure phase of MnO2 (JCPDF no. 44-0141) (Fig. 2F), which indicates that the following chemical reaction was employed. 3MnCl2 + 2KMnO4 + 2H2O → 5MnO2↓ + 2H2SO4(1)

Theoretically, the Gibbs free energy change (2269.2 kJ mol−1) represents a strong tendency for this reaction to progress towards completion. The formation of nanowires is in fact the transformation of manganese hydroxide to oxide, a process that has been well discussed in many publications for the same or similar metal alkoxides;22–25i.e., through the formation of Mn–O covalent and Mn–OH coordination bonds, the manganese hydroxide tended to form longer chains and additional one-dimensional nanowires through van der Waals interaction as well as an oxygen-bridge.19,26 Thus, the MnO2 nanowires acted as the original material sources for subsequent hydrothermal reactions. In this step, cobalt ion is only adsorbed by the resultant MnO2 nanowires and does not affect the formation of MnO2, considering the Gibbs free energy change.
In the following hydrothermal step, the morphology changed dramatically from one-dimensional nanowires to hollow-structured octahedrons, which could be ascribed to the dissolution–recrystallization effect under the high reaction temperature and pressure (Fig. 2B–E). It has been reported that the solvothermal reaction can not only promote dissolution of the oxide precursor, but also help to replace hydroxyl groups (OH−) for oxygen (O2−) and to induce cationic substitutions. Thus, the solubility of the manganese precursor (MnO2 nanowire) appears to also play an important role for orienting the stabilization of a stable structural form. Here, the stabilization of different structural forms can help form a mixed oxide via the following reactions (eqn (2)). (2) (3)
The MnO2 nanowires are first transformed to short CoxMn3−xO4 nanorods with typical diameters of 20–50 nm and lengths of 200 nm to 1 μm (Fig. 2B), which were then assembled with each other and formed bundle-like aggregates (Fig. 2C). When the reaction further progresses, these shortened nanorods tend to automatically agglomerate together. The obvious dissolution–recrystallization process even caused an interpenetration prototype of octahedrons with a certain angle and contact point, which eventually recrystallized into highly ordered octahedrons (Fig. 2D and E). The phase transformation is also proven by the XRD patterns shown in Fig. 2F. The MnO2 phase began to diminish with an increase in the reaction time, while the diffraction ascribed to (220) and (311) of CoxMn3−xO4 intensified gradually. It takes about 2 h for the complete conversion of the cobalt–adsorbed MnO2 nanowire to CoxMn3−xO4 nanorods, and 4 h for the Mn3O4 nanorod to dissolute and recrystallize into CoxMn3−xO4 octahedron.
Another interesting issue is the formation mechanism of a hollow structure under hydrothermal conditions. In the past, it has been proposed that manganese oxides develop either from an initial nanoparticle agglomerated mass under the reflux conditions, or a rolling mechanism under the hydrothermal conditions.27 To investigate the detailed formation process of the hollow structure under hydrothermal conditions, the precipitates were taken out right after the reaction time exceeded 3 h. Note that the reaction does not stop immediately after the autoclave is removed from the heater owing to heat transfer; thus, we can believe that the samples randomly taken represent certain characteristics of the formation process.
Structural information of the as-prepared CoxMn3−xO4 octahedron was further confirmed by SEM and TEM (Fig. 3). The clearly observed grain boundary within the octahedron hints a mechanism analogous to void formation in the Kirkendall effect (Fig. 3B–E).28 The two solids (Mn–Co oxides) diffuse into each other at different rates and the unfilled voids are left behind. Within the small volume of a transforming CoxMn3−xO4 micro/nanocrystal, the supersaturated vacancy cloud is likely to coalesce into large pores or a single void via the following route shown in eqn (3).
 Fig. 3  SEM (A) and TEM (B–E) images of the CoxMn3−xO4 hollow octahedrons taken from the hydrothermally treated intermediates. 
For instances of cobalt doping, significant inward cobalt transport could occur through grain boundaries or during the formation of the first few monolayers of CoxMn3−xO4. It is also possible that inward relaxation of the hole occurs, due to annihilation of vacancies at a semi-coherent or incoherent manganese–cobalt interface (Fig. 3B–E). It is observed that increased cobalt concentration increased the hole size and enhanced the outward growth of the shell, indicating that manganese mobility rather than cobalt mobility was the driving force of formation of inner voids.
We therefore propose a possible growth mechanism for the CoxMn3−xO4 hollow octahedrons, which can be divided into three stages. Firstly, MnO2 nanowires are constructed from chains of {MnO6} octahedra, which are linked together to form tunnelled sequences. Under the hydrothermal conditions, dissolution–recrystallization of MnO2 was initiated for the formation process of CoxMn3−xO4 nanorods and nano-octahedrons. With the increase of reaction time, the “Ostwald ripening” mechanism became the main factor, which enabled and accelerated the transformation from nanorods to octahedrons to minimize the overall energy of the system. It can be seen that the CoxMn3−xO4 nanorods are only transient intermediate products. The dissolution of nanorods and the growth of octahedrons almost occur simultaneously under the hydrothermal conditions. Furthermore, increase in the reaction time resulted in CoO-nuclei, which adsorbed on surfaces of Mn3O4 octahedrons, forming CoxMn3−xO4 layers. With the increase in reaction time, the two solids (Mn–Co oxides) diffused into each other at different rates and the unfilled voids are left behind and coalesce into large voids due to the so-called Kirkendall effect. Such process is supported by the morphology evolution at different growth stages by changing the reaction time Fig. 4. The truncated octahedrons results from a much higher growth rate along the 〈100〉 direction than the 〈111〉 direction due to the lowest energy of the {111} surfaces.

To demonstrate the use of hollow nanocrystals in energy storage, electrochemical performance of the as-synthesized manganese oxides was tested by cyclic voltammetry (CV) at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 in the potential range of 0–1 V using 1 M Na2SO4 aqueous electrolyte solution (Fig. 5). The rectangular and symmetric CV curves of MnO2, Mn3O4, and cobalt–adsorbed MnO2 indicate the typical pseudocapacity, which is in sharp contrast to that of Co0.4Mn2.6O4 and Co1.4Mn1.6O4 (Fig. 5A and B). The lack of symmetry in the latter cases was due to a combination of double-layer and pseudocapacitive effects. In addition, the doped Co ions also make additional contributions to the total capacitance. It is interesting that performances of both Co0.4Mn2.6O4 and Co1.4Mn1.6O4 were significantly improved than that of pure Mn3O4 after the hydrothermal treatment, and Co1.4Mn1.6O4 possesses the best performance. Since Cs is proportional to the average areas of CVs compared with that of Co0.4Mn2.6O4 and Mn3O4, the average area of Co1.4Mn1.6O4 was almost covered by a straight line at different scan rates, which hints a sound cycling stability and deserves further study. In addition, there appears an anodic peak at around 0.9 V for Co0.4Mn2.6O0.4, which should be ascribed to the redox reaction between Mn4+ and Mn3+.

Galvanostatic charge/discharge measurements were carried out in 1 M Na2SO4 between 0 and 1 V at a current density of 200 mA g−1 (Fig. 6). As illustrated in Fig. 6A, during the charging and discharging steps, the charge curves of MnO2–Co2+ad and Co1.4Mn1.6O4 electrodes were almost symmetric to their corresponding discharge counterparts with a slight curvature, indicating the pseudocapacitive contribution along with the double layer contribution. According to the following equation Cs = I × Δt/(ΔV × m)(4)where I is the constant discharge current, t is the discharge time, V is the potential drop during discharge, the Cs values of MnO2–Co2+ad, Co1.4Mn1.6O4 and MnO2 nanowires can be calculated as 294, 266.84, and 236 F g−1 from the discharge curves, respectively, which is consistent with the order indicated by the CVs. In addition, Cs values of Co1.4Mn1.6O4 calculated at 150, 200, 500, and 1000 mA g−1 were 279.405, 266.84, 245.35, and 235.2 F g−1, respectively (Fig. 6B), which indicates that about 84.1% of Cs was retained when the current density increased from 150 to 1000 mA g−1. This sound high power performance should be ascribed to the interior geometry and shell functionality of the hollow structure, which increased the contact area between the electrolyte and the active material, and reduced transport lengths for both mass and charge transport. As a result, the diffusion of ions from the electrolyte could gain full access to the available pores of the electrode, leading to an almost complete insertion reaction, and therefore higher Cs.

The galvanostatic charge/discharge measurements proved that Co1.4Mn1.6O4 hollow octahedrons possess good performance despite the decreasing trend when charge current increased to 1000 from 150 mA g−1. To explore the potential for practical application, the current density was further increased to 5000 mA g−1 (Fig. 7). The Cs values of Co1.4Mn1.6O4 can be calculated as 235.2, 232.848, 232.848, 310.464, 237.352 F g−1 corresponding to the current densities of 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, 5000 mA g−1, respectively. The capacitances at 2000 and 3000 mA g−1 are almost the same as that at 1000 mA g−1, indicating a very stable performance within a wide current range. The large Cs value of 310.464 F g−1 at 4000 mA g−1 and 237.352 F g−1 at 5000 mA g−1 represent a quite good high current performance for practical demands.

The capacitance stability of Co1.4Mn1.6O4 and MnO2–Co2+ad was investigated in the range of 0–1 V at 200 mA g−1 in 1 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution (Fig. 8). The Co1.4Mn1.6O4 electrode retained about 80.214% (214.043 F g−1) of the initial capacitance after 1000 cycles, while that of MnO2–Co2+ad retained only about 54.87% (161.319 F g−1). In addition to the intrinsic electrochemical stability of the double-layer, we attribute the much enhanced long-time stability to the following points. On the one hand, such porous hollow texture combines macroporous cores, mesoporous walls, and micropores together, as shown in Fig. 3. The physicochemical properties of the electrolyte in the macropores are similar to those of the bulk electrolyte with the lowest resistance. Ion-buffering reservoirs can be formed in the macropores to minimize the diffusion distances to the interior surfaces. The porous walls provide low-resistant pathways for the ions through the porous particles, and the micropores strengthen the electric double-layer capacitance. On the other hand, the doped cobalt ions can enhance the electric conductivity, which helps us to overcome the primary kinetic limits of electrochemical processes in oxide electrodes.

Conclusions
We demonstrated that MnO2 nanowires, CoxMn3−xO4 nanorods and hollow octahedrons could be fabricated through a simple hydrothermal method without using any template or surfactant. A dissolution–recrystallization mechanism has been proposed to explain the phase transformation from a MnO2 nanowire precursor, and the Kirkendall effect to account for the formation of hollow-structured mixed oxides. Improved specific capacitance and good cycle stability were observed in aqueous electrolytes. We believe that the sound high-power capacitance and long-term stability should be ascribed to both the intrinsic low-resistant pathways for the ions through the porous particles, as well as the enhanced electric conductivity, to overcome the primary kinetic limits of electrochemical processes in oxide electrodes. We think that this concept can be extended for enhancing the performance of different electrochemical systems.
