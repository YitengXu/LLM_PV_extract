    , Accepted 15th February 2018First published on 15th February 2018AbstractA dialkoxyl-substituted naphthodithieno[3,2-b]thiophene-based copolymer (PV12) was applied as a third component for ternary polymer solar cells (PSCs) based on PCDTBT1−x:PV12x:PC71BM. In Al-only ternary PSCs with x = 0.15, a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 6.73% was achieved due to simultaneous enhancement in the open circuit voltage, short circuit current and fill factor, which is much higher than the PCE of 5.28% for Al-only binary PSCs based on PCDTBT:PC71BM and 2.93% for Al-only binary PSCs based on PV12:PC71BM. The PCE reached 7.69% when IIDTh-NSB as a cathode interlayer was introduced between the ternary active layer and Al. Ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy measurements demonstrated a cascade-type energy level alignment at the ternary PCDTBT(D1)/PV12(D2)/PC71BM(A) junction. As a result, the voltage limitation was overcome at the D1/D2/A junction. Ultraviolet-visible absorption and external quantum efficiency spectra showed that PV12 had complementary absorption to PCDTBT in the solar spectrum. Atomic force microscopy and transmission electron microscopy images showed that the morphology and phase separation of the active layer were optimized by adding PV12. Photoluminescence spectral investigations suggested that the Förster resonance energy transfer from PCDTBT to PV12 occurred in the ternary PSCs under illumination. Finally, the PCEs of the ternary PSCs are not as sensitive to the thickness of the active layer as those of the binary PSCs, which is important for the roll-to-roll coating processing of organic photovoltaic modules.
1. Introduction
Polymer solar cells (PSCs), as a renewable clean energy technology, have attracted intense interest by virtue of their synthetic variability, light weight, low-cost, large-area, flexibility and roll-to-roll fabrication.1–5 Benefiting from the great efforts made on the development of novel photovoltaic materials and optimization of the photoactive layer morphology and interfaces between the electrode and active layer, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of single junction PSCs has been increasing and now exceeds 13%.6 At present, almost all the PSCs based on polymer:fullerene as an active layer are confronted with a challenge that photons from the sun cannot be totally captured due to the relatively limited absorption of conjugated polymers in the solar spectrum, restricting further enhancement of the PCE.7 There are two main strategies employed to broaden the optical absorption spectra and hence to promote their photovoltaic performance: (i) fabricate so-called tandem PSCs in which two or more subcells with complementary optical absorption spectra are integrated in one device in series8–10 or in parallel;11,12 and (ii) fabricate so-called ternary PSCs in which another photoactive organic semiconductor with a complementary absorption spectrum is introduced into the typically used binary active layer.
Consequently, ternary PSCs have drawn greater attention due to their versatile features which integrate the advantages of enhancing the photon harvesting of tandem solar cells and the simple processing conditions of single junction solar cells.13,14 As is customary in ternary PSCs, the active layer contains three components: the main donor:acceptor system and the third component which can be an electron donor,15–17 an electron acceptor18–20 or a non-volatile additive.21–23 Admittedly, the appropriate selection of the third component is one of the critical factors for the ternary system. A good third component must show not only a complementary absorption spectrum and an appropriate energy level24–28 but also good miscibility with the main donor and acceptor in order to control the domain size of the ternary blend for efficient exciton dissociation.29–33 It is expected that simultaneous enhancements in the open circuit voltage (VOC), short circuit current (JSC) and fill factor (FF) can be achieved to obtain highly efficient ternary PSCs. However, for almost all the ternary PSCs reported previously, VOC is equal to the smaller one of the two related binary solar cells or assumes a value between those of the two binary devices depending on the relative content of the third component.34–36 Recently, the Fahlman group reported ternary PSCs with enhanced VOC due to the cascade-type energy level alignment at the ternary PTB7-Th/m-ITIC/PC71BM junction.37 Unfortunately, the FF of the ternary PSCs based on PTB7-Th:PC71BM:m-ITIC was lower than that of the binary PSCs based on PTB7-Th:PC71BM. To our knowledge, there are hardly any ternary PSCs with simultaneously enhanced VOC, JSC and FF compared to the two related binary PSCs even though some ternary PSCs with simultaneously enhanced VOC, JSC and FF relative to one of the two related binary PSCs have been reported in the literature.17–19,26–31
PCDTBT has been widely used in photovoltaic applications owing to its outstanding chemical stability, good organization, excellent solubility and high photon-to-electron conversion efficiency. However, the PCEs of PSCs based on PCDTBT:PC71BM were limited to 5–7% due to the absorption of PCDTBT between 350 nm and 650 nm.38,39 What is more, the optimal thickness of PCDTBT:PC71BM was limited to approximately 70 nm due to the relatively low hole mobility of PCDTBT, which is highly problematic if pinhole-free large area modules are needed at high printing rates in high-throughput processing methods such as the roll-to-roll approach. Therefore it is necessary to add a third component into binary PSCs based on PCDTBT:PC71BM for achieving highly efficient and thick-film PSCs. A dialkoxyl-substituted naphthodithieno[3,2-b]thiophene (NDTT)-based copolymer (named PV12 in Fig. 1a) has broad absorption in the visible light range up to ∼ 800 nm, good solution processability and a high hole mobility of 0.04 cm2 V−1 s−1 due to crystalline stacking with small π–π distance in thin films.40 As shown in Fig. 1b, the absorption spectra of PCDTBT and PV12 are complementary to each other. Therefore PV12 should be a good candidate as a third component of efficient ternary PSCs based on PCDTBT1−x:PV12x:PC71BM.

(c) Energy level diagrams of the materials used in the ternary active layer. 
In this contribution, PV12 at various concentrations is doped into the PCDTBT:PC71BM system. In Al-only ternary PSCs (Fig. 1a) with x = 0.15, a PCE of 6.73% is achieved due to simultaneous enhancement in VOC, JSC and FF, which is much higher than the PCE of 5.28% for Al-only binary related PSCs based on PCDTBT:PC71BM and 2.93% for Al-only binary related PSCs based on PV12:PC71BM. The PCE could reach 7.69% when IIDTh-NSB (an alcohol-soluble isoindigo derivative as shown in Scheme S1, ESI†) as a cathode interlayer (CIL) was introduced between the ternary active layer with a thickness of 75 nm and Al. When the thickness of the ternary active layer was increased to 200 nm, the PCE still could remain at 6.28% in the PSCs with IIDTh-NSB. Ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy (UPS) measurements showed a cascade-type energy level alignment at the ternary PCDTBT(D1)/PV12(D2)/PC71BM(A) junction. As a result, the voltage limitation was overcome at the D1/D2/A junction. Ultraviolet-visible absorption and external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra demonstrated that PV12 had complementary absorption to PCDTBT in the solar spectrum. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images showed that the morphology and phase separation of the active layer were optimized by adding PV12. Photoluminescence (PL) spectral investigations suggested that the Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) from PCDTBT to PV12 occurred in the ternary PSCs under illumination.
2. Experimental details
2.1 Materials and solutions
The synthesis procedures of PV12 and IIDTh-NSB can be found in ref. 40 and 41, respectively. PCDTBT and PC71BM were purchased from 1-Material (Canada) and American Dye Sources, Inc., respectively. 1,2-Dichlorobenzene (DCB), chlorobenzene (CB) and methanol were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. All the materials were used as delivered. The chemical structures and energy level diagrams of PCDTBT, PV12 and PC71BM are shown in Fig. 1c.
PCDTBT, PV12 and PC71BM were dissolved in a chlorobenzene:1,2-dichlorobenzene solvent mixture (1:3 vol.) to prepare 35 mg ml−1 blend solutions. The polymers:PC71BM weight ratio is kept at 1:4. The doping concentrations of PV12 in donors (PCDTBT and PV12) are 0, 10, 15, 20, 30, and 100 wt%.
2.2 Device fabrication
The device configuration of the fabricated PSCs is ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Al (Fig. 1a). The ITO substrates were pre-cleaned carefully with deionized water, acetone and isopropanol in an ultrasonic bath. Then the substrates were dried under a nitrogen flow and treated with UV-ozone for 20 minutes. A 35 nm PEDOT:PSS (Baytron PVP Al 4083) film was spin-coated on the ITO and annealed at 110 °C for 30 min in air. A PCDTBT1−x:PV12x:PC71BM blend film was spin-coated on the PEDOT:PSS film in a high-purity nitrogen-filled glove box to fabricate the active layers. PSCs based on PCDTBT1−x:PV12x:PC71BM were baked at 75 °C for 10 min before a 100 nm Al film was deposited by thermal evaporation under 10−4 Pa. The active area is about 4 mm2, which is defined by the vertical overlap of the ITO anode and Al cathode.
2.3 Measurements and characterization
Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra of the blend films were obtained using a Shimadzu UV-3101 PC spectrometer. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the PSCs were measured under a N2 atmosphere in the glove box using a Keithley 2400 source measurement unit under illumination and in the dark. The solar cell performance was tested under a 1 sun, AM 1.5G full spectrum solar simulator (Photo Emission Tech Inc., model #SS50AAA-GB) with an irradiation intensity of 100 mW cm−2 calibrated with a standard silicon photovoltaic traced to the National Institute of Metrology, China. Space charge limited current (SCLC) measurements were carried out in the following device configurations: (a) ITO/Al/LiF/active layers/LiF/Al for the electron-only device and (b) ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layers/MoOx/Al for the hole-only device. EQE spectra were measured using a QTEST HIFINITY 5 (Crowntech Inc., USA) at room temperature in air. AFM images were measured with an S II Nanonaviprobe station 300 HV (Seiko, Japan) in tapping mode. TEM images were measured using a JEM-2100F (JEOL, Japan). UPS experiments were carried out using a UPS system equipped with a VG Scienta R3000 analyzer in an ultrahigh vacuum with a base pressure of 1 × 10−10 mbar. Monochromatized He Iα radiation from a discharge lamp supplies photons with 21.22 eV for UPS. The vertical ionization potential (the HOMO levels vs. vacuum level) was obtained from the frontier edge of the occupied density of states. PL spectra were obtained using an RF-5301PC spectrofluorophotometer.
3. Results and discussion

Fig. 1b shows absorption spectra of PCDTBT1−x:PV12x blend films with x = 0.1, 0.15, 0.2 and 0.3 from 300 nm to 800 nm. For comparison, absorption spectra of PCDTBT and PV12 films are also shown. The PCDTBT film (black line) presents absorption with two peaks at 395 nm and 583 nm. The PV12 film (navy line) presents absorption with the two main peaks at 423 nm and 723 nm accompanying the shoulder peak at 662 nm. Obviously, PCDTBT and PV12 have complementary absorption in the visible light range. When the doping ratio of PV12 in the PV12+PCDTBT changes from 0% to 30%, the two absorption peaks at 395 nm and 583 nm shift to 405 nm and 591 nm, respectively, due to the absorption overlap of the two polymers. The intensities of the two peaks between 350 nm and 650 nm mainly from PCDTBT gradually decrease, while the intensity of the peak at 723 nm gradually increases with increasing PV12 doping ratio.
Based on the absorption spectra of the blend films, a series of binary and ternary Al-only PSCs with different PV12 doping ratios were fabricated under the same conditions. Binary PSCs based on PCDTBT:PC71BM and PV12:PC71BM are named Device 1 and Device 6, respectively. Ternary PSCs based on PCDTBT1−x:PV12x:PC71BM are named Device 2 for PCDTBT0.9:PV120.1, Device 3 for PCDTBT0.85:PV120.15, Device 4 for PCDTBT0.8:PV120.2 and Device 5 for PCDTBT0.7:PV120.3. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of all the cells were measured under AM 1.5G light illumination at 100 mW cm−2 and are shown in Fig. 2a. The key photovoltaic parameters are summarized and listed in Table 1 according to the J–V curves. Clearly, Device 3 (with PCDTBT0.85:PV120.15) demonstrates the highest PCE (6.73%) due to the highest JSC (12.15 mA cm−2), VOC (0.88 V) and FF (63%) accompanying the lowest series resistance (Rs) and the highest shunt resistance (Rsh). This indicates that PCDTBT:PV12 = 0.85:0.15 is an optimal doping ratio for PCDTBT1−x:PV12x:PC71BM systems. The champion PCE of 6.73% from Device 3 is much higher than those of the binary PCDTBT:PC71BM-based PSC (PCE = 5.28% due to JSC = 10.97 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.84 V and FF = 57% for Device 1) and the PV12:PC71BM-based PSC (PCE = 2.93% due to JSC = 6.01 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.80 V and FF = 62% for Device 6). It is worth noting that the PCE of the ternary PSCs can be further improved to 7.69% when IIDTh-NSB as a CIL is introduced in the ternary PSCs based on PCDTBT0.85:PV120.15:PC71BM as shown in Table 2. The best performance of Device 3 (with PCDTBT0.85:PV120.15) is supported by the dependence of the photocurrent density (Jph) on the effective voltage (Veff) in Fig. 2b, where Jph = JL − JD (JL and JD are the current densities under illumination and in the dark, respectively) and Veff = V0 − Va (V0 is the voltage at Jph = 0 and Va is the applied bias voltage). The Jph/Jph,sat ratio indicates the probabilities of exciton dissociation and charge collection. At a sufficiently high Veff, the photocurrent is saturated without recombination (Jph,sat). Under short circuit conditions, the highest Jph,sc/Jph,sat (96.6%) is obtained from Device 3, implying the optimized exciton dissociation efficiency in the ternary active layers. Under the maximum power output conditions, the highest Jph,max/Jph,sat (80.5%) is also achieved in Device 3, suggesting the most enhanced charge extraction and collection. Detailed data are listed in Table S2 (ESI†). The JSC-EQE values calculated from integration of the EQE spectra of Devices 1–6 (Fig. 2c) as listed in Table 1 are basically in agreement with the JSC obtained from J–V characteristics under illumination. This means that the JSC values measured for the ternary PSCs are reliable and the PCE values presented in this manuscript are not overvalued. Moreover, compared to Device 1 (with PCDTBT:PC71BM), Devices 2, 3 and 4 present an apparent increase between 350 nm and 650 nm in the EQE spectra likely due to the better phase separation of PCDTBT in the ternary active layer, while the EQE spectrum of Device 5 decrease in that range probably because the amount of PCDTBT is too small. However, the EQE spectra of all the ternary devices increase between 650 nm and 800 nm due to PV12 added.

Compared to Device 1, all the PSCs with PV12 show much higher FF values as listed in Table 1. In particular, the FF of Device 3 reaches 63%. This implies that PV12 resulted in an improved charge transport ability. In order to confirm the improved charge carrier transport, the mobilities of electrons and holes were measured in the electron-only and hole-only devices using the SCLC method.42 The SCLC is described by the Mott–Gurney equation: J = 9ε0εrμV2/8L3(1)where ε0 is the permittivity of free space, εr is the dielectric constant of the active layer, μ is the carrier mobility, V is the voltage drop across the device, and L is the thickness of the active layer. The hole mobility (μh) and electron mobility (μe) were extracted from hole-only devices and electron-only devices, respectively (Fig. S2 (ESI†) and Table 1). The μe/μh values of all the devices are also summarized in Table 1. Obviously, PV12 gave rise to an increase of electron mobility and a slight decrease of hole mobility in the ternary devices compared to the binary device based on PCDTBT:PC71BM. In particular, the device based on PCDTBT0.85:PV120.15:PC71BM presents the highest μh (5.23 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1) and μe/μh = 1.02, which is the closest to 1, indicating more balanced electron and hole transport. These changes in charge carrier mobility may be related to the difference in phase separation between the ternary devices and the binary devices, which will be demonstrated in the following AFM and TEM images.
It should be noted that all the ternary PSCs (Devices 2–5) feature larger VOC than both of the binary PSCs (Device 1 and Device 6). The highest VOC value is 0.88 V obtained in Device 3, which is 40 mV and 80 mV higher than those of the binary PSCs based on PCDTBT:PC71BM and PV12:PC71BM, respectively. Similarly, the ternary PSC based on PCDTBT0.85:PV120.15:PC71BM treated with methanol has a VOC of 0.905 V, which is 30 mV and 95 mV higher than those of the binary PSCs based on PCDTBT:PC71BM treated with methanol and PV12:PC71BM treated with methanol, respectively; see Table S5 (ESI†). Even the VOC of the PCDTBT0.85:PV120.15:PC71BM-based PSC with IIDTh-NSB as the CIL is also slightly higher that of the PCDTBT:PC71BM-based PSC with IIDTh-NSB as the CIL; see Table 2. Obviously, doping PV12 into PCDTBT:PC71BM increases not only JSC and FF but also VOC. We stress that this increase of VOC in the ternary solar cells relative to the two binary solar cells is the same as the results recently reported by the Fahlman group,37 which are different from almost all other systems previously reported in the literature.17–23 The UPS spectra of pure PCDTBT, PV12 and PC71BM films on ITO substrates were measured and are shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). The HOMO levels vs. vacuum level derived from the UPS spectra are 5.40 eV for PCDTBT, 5.49 eV for PV12 and 5.96 eV for PC71BM. The LUMO levels of PCDTBT, PV12 and PC71BM are estimated to be roughly equal to 3.55 eV, 3.90 eV and 4.26 eV, respectively, using the HOMO levels and optical band gaps. Fig. 1c shows the cascade-type energy level alignment at the ternary PCDTBT(D1)/PV12(D2)/PC71BM(A) junction, which enhances exciton dissociation and reduces bimolecular recombination and trap assisted recombination via integer charge transfer (ICT) states. As a result, the voltage limitation was overcome at the D1/D2/A junction as predicted by Fahlman et al.37
The built-in voltage (Vbi) influences the internal electric field in the PSCs and gives the upper limit for the VOC provided that the work function difference of the electrodes is larger than the donor HOMO–acceptor LUMO offset in the PSCs. Thus the increased VOC should be consistent with the increased Vbi across the devices. In order to confirm this speculation, we performed capacitance (C)–voltage (V) measurements.43,44Fig. 2d shows (C/A)−2–V curves of the devices in the dark. The Vbi value is estimated using the Mott–Schottky relation (eqn (2)) as follows: (2)where Vbi is the flat-band potential, which is obtained from the intercept of linear (C/A)−2–V, q is the elementary charge, ε0 is the dielectric constant of vacuum, εr represents the relative dielectric constant of the semiconductor and A is the active area of the device. According to eqn (2), the charge carrier density N can be obtained from the slope of linear (C/A)−2–V. The Vbi and N values of Devices 1–6 are presented in Table 1. Markedly, the Vbi (1.07 V) of Device 3 is higher than those of the other devices, which rationalizes its higher VOC (0.88 V). The Vbi change is basically consistent with the difference in VOC in Devices 1–6. Furthermore, there is a higher charge carrier density (9.61 × 1016 cm−3) in Device 3 than those of the other devices. Therefore Device 3 demonstrates the highest JSC in all the devices likely due to fewer charge carrier recombinations.
In order to confirm that the enhanced JSC and FF in the ternary PSCs are related to the formation of well-connected percolated networks in the blend active layer, AFM and TEM were used to investigate the morphologies of the PCDTBT1−x:PV12x:PC71BM blend films. It is generally known that the surface morphology, phase separation degree and bi-continuous interpenetrating network of the active layer play critical roles in determining the performance of the solar cells. To gain insight into the relation between phase separation in the blend films and device performance, the surface morphologies of the blend films with different PV12 doping ratios were first studied by AFM. Fig. 3 shows the surface morphologies of PCDTBT1−x:PV12x:PC71BM (x = 0, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.3 and 1), where a1–f1 show height images and a2–f2 show phase images. The root-mean-square (RMS) roughness values of the PCDTBT:PC71BM and PC71BM:PV12 films are 0.66 nm in Fig. 3a1 and 3.39 nm in Fig. 3f1, respectively. The RMS values of the ternary blend films with PV12 doping ratios from 10 to 30 wt% are 0.58 nm (Fig. 3b1), 0.57 nm (Fig. 3c1), 0.56 nm (Fig. 3d1) and 0.43 nm (Fig. 3e1), respectively, which are much smoother and more homogeneous than those of both the binary blend films. And the smoother surface may improve the contact between the active layer and cathode (Al), resulting in better charge transport to the cathode in the ternary blend system. Furthermore, a better phase separation can be observed in the ternary blend films as shown in Fig. 3a2–f2, which contributes to higher charge dissociation probabilities and charge transfer efficiencies.

In order to investigate the effect of PV12 on the bulk morphologies of PCDTBT1−x:PV12x:PC71BM blends, TEM measurements of PCDTBT:PC71BM, PCDTBT0.85:PV120.15:PC71BM and PV12:PC71BM were also carried out. Compared to polymers, the higher electron density of PC71BM causes electrons to be scattered more efficiently by the PC71BM from the TEM beam. Thus, the darker regions in the TEM images are PC71BM, while the lighter regions are polymers. A dramatic difference in bulk morphology between the ternary blend film and the binary blend films can be clearly observed in Fig. 4. The ternary blend film in Fig. 4b displays fine nanoscale phase separation, while both the PCDTBT:PC71BM blend in Fig. 4a and the PV12:PC71BM blend in Fig. 4c present distinct large-size clusters due to the strong phase separation between PCDTBT and PC71BM or between PV12 and PC71BM. Moreover, the networked nanoscale fibers corresponding to the polymers inside the ternary blends are pronounced, indicating that doping PV12 increases the compatibility between the polymers and PC71BM in the ternary blend. Apparently, the ternary blend film has not only smaller nanoscale phase separation but also better-connected percolated networks. In contrast, for the binary blends, excitons formed in the film with strong phase separation and large domain size will recombine frequently before reaching the interfaces between PCDTBT and PC71BM or between PV12 and PC71BM, resulting in a concomitant loss of photocurrent. Consequently, the JSC value of Device 3 based on PCDTBT0.85:PV120.15:PC71BM was improved to 12.15 mA cm−2 from the 10.97 mA cm−2 of Device 1 based on PCDTBT:PC71BM and 6.01 mA cm−2 of Device 6 based on PV12:PC71BM (Table 1). Furthermore, the better-connected percolated networks correspond to the great increase of hole mobility as shown in Table 1. The large voids between the polymer fibrils in Fig. 4a and c may act as charge-trapping sites to impede the charge-carrier transportation. For the ternary blend film, the TEM image reveals excellent nanoscale phase separation between the polymers and PC71BMs and exhibits dense connection pathways between polymer chains, which leads to higher hole mobility in Device 3. As a result, a better mobility balance of holes and electrons is achieved in Device 3, which contributes to a higher FF (Table 1).

To further investigate the location of PV12 molecules in the blend films, we studied the surface energies of various films, which can be calculated based on contact angle measurements according to equations from the “three-liquid acid–base method”.45–47 Water, ethylene glycol and hexadecane were chosen as the three probing liquids. Films were prepared by spin-coating solutions onto ITO substrates. Photos of water, ethylene glycol and hexadecane droplets on the surfaces of the films are shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†). As described in the ESI,† the interfacial tensions (also named interfacial surface energy) of the neat PCDTBT, PC71BM and PV12 are 27.83 mJ cm−2, 31.19 mJ cm−2 and 27.27 mJ cm−2, respectively. The interfacial surface energy between different materials (A and B) in the blend films can be further calculated using eqn (3) for interfacial tensions.48 (3)where γA−B represents the interfacial surface energy between A and B, β = 0.000115 m4 mJ−2. According to the interfacial tensions, the wetting coefficient of PV12 (ωPV12) in the blends of PCDTBT and PC71BM can be calculated using Young's equation49 (eqn (4)). (4)If ωPV12 > 1, PV12 will be distributed within the PCDTBT domain. If −1 < ωPV12 < 1, PV12 will be distributed at the interface between PCDTBT and PC71BM. If ωPV12 < −1, PV12 will be located in the PC71BM domain. The wetting coefficient of PV12 in PCDTBT:PC71BM blend films was calculated to be 1.33, which suggests that PV12 molecules may prefer to locate in the PCDTBT domain. Detailed data are listed in Tables S3 and S4 (ESI†).
The Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) process is an effective strategy to greatly enhance the efficiency of ternary solar cells.50 The absorption of PV12 overlaps well with an emission spectrum of PCDTBT in Fig. 5a, implying the possible occurrence of FRET between PV12 and PCDTBT. Photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy is a convenient tool to probe the FRET. Generally, if energy transfer exists between two different bandgap donors, one would expect an increased emission intensity for the relatively low bandgap donor with a decreased emission intensity for the other donor, considering that the quantum yields of the two donors are similar. On the other hand, if charge transfer occurs between two donors, the emission intensity of one donor would be quenched without increased emission intensity for the other donor.51–54Fig. 5b shows the PL spectra of the PCDTBT, PV12 and PCDTBT1−x:PV12x (x = 0.10, 0.15, 0.20 and 0.30) blend films under 580 nm light excitation. The pure PCDTBT film exhibits strong PL emission with an emission peak about 703 nm, while the pure PV12 film shows a rather weak PL emission with an emission peak at about 788 nm. For the PCDTBT1−x:PV12x blend films, the PL emission from PCDTBT is markedly quenched with increase of PV12 doping ratios in the blend films. More than 80% PCDTBT emission is quenched by doping 10 wt% PV12 in the blend films. At the same time, doping PV12 causes an obvious blue-shift of the PCDTBT emission peak due to a decrease of PCDTBT aggregation. Even 10 wt% PV12 can lead to about a 12 nm blue-shift of the PCDTBT emission peak from 703 nm to 691 nm. This indicates that adding a few PV12 molecules can greatly change the morphology of PCDTBT as shown in Fig. 4b. In addition, the emission intensity of PV12 becomes strong in the PCDTBT1−x:PV12x blend films although the PV12 contents in the blend films are much lower than the pure PV12 film, as shown in Fig. 5b. The findings suggest an efficient energy transfer from PCDTBT to PV12 molecules. The PL spectra of the pure and blend solutions were further measured under 580 nm light excitation to identify the dynamic process between PCDTBT and PV12, as shown in Fig. 5c. The pure PCDTBT solution shows strong PL emission from 600 nm to 850 nm with an emission peak at 688 nm. The pure PV12 solution exhibits PL emission in a narrow emission range from 725 nm to 850 nm with an emission peak at about 778 nm. The PL emission peaks of the PCDTBT and PV12 solutions show an apparent blue-shift compared with those of the corresponding films, resulting from the enhanced intermolecular π–π stacking in solid state films. The PL emission of the PCDTBT solution is also markedly quenched by doping a small amount of PV12; meanwhile, the PL emission peak at 778 nm of PV12 is gradually enhanced with increasing PV12 doping ratios in the solutions. It is highlighted that the PL emission intensities around 778 nm for all the PCDTBT1−x:PV12x blend solutions are much stronger than that of the pure PV12 or PCDTBT solution under the same excitation conditions, further suggesting an efficient energy transfer from PCDTBT to PV12. It should be noted that charge transfer would occur between the two donors because of the close HOMO levels of PCDTBT and PV12, and the lower-lying LUMO level of PV12 than that of PCDTBT, as shown in Fig. 1d. Therefore energy transfer and charge transfer are supposed to coexist in the blends.51–55

The optimized morphology and energy transfer between the two donors enhance charge carrier mobility and exciton dissociation efficiency in the ternary PSCs. To examine the effect of adding PV12 on the thickness of the ternary active layer, we fabricated binary PSCs based on PCDTBT:PC71BM and ternary PSCs based on PCDTBT0.85:PV120.15:PC71BM with a device configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer (70 nm, 150 nm, 200 nm)/IIDTh-NSB (8 nm)/Al. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of all the cells were measured under AM 1.5G light illumination at 100 mW cm−2 and are shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†). The key photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 2. Compared to the devices with 75 nm active layers, the PCE of the binary PSC with a 200 nm active layer decreases by 33% due to the simultaneous decrease in VOC, JSC and FF, while the PCE of the ternary PSC with a 200 nm active layer only decreases by 18% because of a slight increase in JSC and a decrease in VOC and FF. This indicates that the ternary PSCs are not very sensitive to the thickness of the active layer, which is important for the roll-to-roll coating processing of organic photovoltaic modules.
4. Conclusions
Ternary PSCs with simultaneously enhanced VOC, JSC and FF were achieved by doping PV12 into a PCDTBT:PC71BM system. The PCE of Al-only ternary PSCs based on PCDTBT0.85:PV120.15:PC71BM reached 6.73%, which is much higher than the PCE of 5.28% for Al-only binary PSCs based on PCDTBT:PC71BM and 2.93% for Al-only binary PSCs based on PV12:PC71BM. The PCE reached 7.69% when IIDTh-NSB as a CIL was introduced between the ternary active layer and Al. UPS measurements showed a cascade-type energy level alignment at the ternary PCDTBT/PV12/PC71BM junction. Ultraviolet-visible absorption and EQE spectra demonstrated that PV12 had complementary absorption to PCDTBT in the solar spectrum. AFM and TEM images showed that the morphology and phase separation of the active layer were optimized by adding PV12. PL spectra suggested that FRET from PCDTBT to PV12 occurred in the ternary PSCs under illumination. Finally, the PCEs of the ternary PSCs are not as sensitive to the thickness of the active layer as those of the binary devices based on PCDTBT:PC71BM, which is important for the roll-to-roll coating processing of organic photovoltaic modules.
