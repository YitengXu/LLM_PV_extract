    , Accepted 7th May 2022First published on 13th May 2022AbstractThe multifunctional theranostic nanoplatform based on the combination of persistent luminescent nanoparticles (PLNPs) and metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) has both in vivo imaging and tumor therapeutic drug-loading functions, providing a new strategy for accurate and effective tumor diagnosis and treatment. Herein, the near-infrared (NIR) PLNP SiO2@Zn1.05Ga1.9O4:Cr was combined with HKUST-1 MOFs to form a core–shell structure theranostic nanoplatform which possessed the triple function of autofluorescence-free NIR PersL bioimaging, tumor chemodynamic therapy (CDT), and tumor photothermal therapy (PTT). Also, the photothermal conversion efficiency reached 58.7%, which is superior to the reported nano metal–organic framework (NMOF) photothermal reagents. We demonstrated that the nanoplatform could enter the tumors of mice within 0.5 h and could be target-activated by H2O2 and H2S in the tumor cells, resulting in effective PTT and CDT synergistic treatment. Tumor-bearing mice experiments showed that the tumor could be completely cured without harming normal tissue. This theranostic nanoplatform may provide a promising strategy showing imaging, PTT, and CDT synergistic treatment tri-mode for clinical cancer therapy.
Introduction
Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) are widely used in catalysis, gas storage, separation, and detection thanks to their structural advantages.1,2 In recent years, because of their adjustable porosity structure and diversified chemical properties, the biological application of nano metal–organic frameworks (NMOFs) has attracted more attention.3,4 However, NMOFs are mostly used as transport tools, for example, ZIF-8 was used as a transport tool by combining with Cr-doped ZnGa2O4.5 The excellent anticancer properties of NMOF materials have also attracted more and more attention.4 Due to the excellent PTT and CDT effects of HKUST-1,6–8 it has the potential to be used as a therapy tool for cancer. HKUST-1 has good photothermal and chemokinetic effects in cancer treatment, but it does not possess the imaging function.9 Therefore, we chose to combine HKUST-1 with the near-infrared (NIR) PersL material Cr-doped ZnGa2O4, for the following reasons: (1) the ligand molecules of the NMOF could connect with the metal ion source (metal oxide) without surface modification,10 and then coordinate with Cu2+ ions to form more NMOFs loaded on the nanoparticles. This could increase the content of Cu2+ and improve the photothermal efficiency of the nanoplatform because Cu2+ reacts with H2S to form CuS, which can be used as a photothermal reagent; (2) NIR persistent luminescence materials can avoid background interference and are suitable for use for biological imaging; (3) the emission spectra of persistent luminescence overlaps with the absorption spectra of CuS, which is generated from HKUST-1 through the targeted activation by H2S, which may promote the photothermal treatment effect; (4) the nanoplatform can realize the integration of diagnosis and treatment.
Due to the NIR PersL not causing background interference, the application of Cr-doped ZnGa2O4 for bioimaging has attracted more and more attention.11 High-temperature calcination is a necessary condition to obtain Cr-doped ZnGa2O4 nanoparticles with better luminescence performance.12 However, with the increase of the calcination temperature, ZnGa2O4 nanoparticles are distinctly aggregated and the size of the nanoparticles can grow to several microns with an uncontrollable morphology.13 In order to ensure the uniformity and dispersity of ZnGa2O4 nanoparticles, mSiO2 can be used as a template loaded with ZnGa2O4 for high-temperature calcination. Because of its key advantages, like high specific area, easy control of synthesis, good morphology, excellent biocompatibility, and huge pore volume,14mSiO2 is an excellent template for preparing nanoscale composite materials. A new kind of nanoplatform, namely mSiO2@ Zn1.05Ga1.9O4:Cr@HKUST-1 (HSZGO), with NIR afterglow luminescence and targeted synergistic therapy for tumor cells, was designed and synthesized (Scheme 1). The HSZGO nanoplatform could carry Cu2+ ions effectively enriched at the tumor site and transit overexpressed endogenous H2O2 into ˙OH to cause harmful oxidative damage to the tumor through a Fenton or Fenton-like reaction.15–20 Furthermore, CuS was formed by HSZGO reacting with disordered endogenous H2S in tumor cells, and acted as the PTT drug to treat tumors effectively.21 HSZGO showed a superior photothermal efficiency of 58.7% in the presence of NaHS in vitro. The tumor of tumor-bearing mice could be cured completely by the synergistic therapy, while there was no noticeable damage caused to the normal tissue cells because the activity of the HSZGO nanoparticles was turned “off” in normal cells. The combination of NMOFs with PersL materials is a new idea to integrate imaging and therapy in a nanoplatform.

Results and discussion
Preparation and characterization
It is a critical step for the subsequent preparation of nanoplatforms to obtain mSiO2 with an appropriate nanosize and satisfactory dispersion. As shown in Fig. 1a, mSiO2 nanoparticles were obtained that showed a uniform and standard spherical morphology with good dispersibility and an average size of about 100 nm. Next, mSiO2@Zn1.05Ga1.9O4:Cr (SZGO) was formed by a high-temperature calcination. It can be seen from the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images (Fig. 1b) that there were distinct black spots displayed in the channels and on the surface, and the spherical shape remained intact. Also, the surface of the nanoparticles became rough with a slightly increased size due to the formation of tiny ZGO particles. Furthermore, the specific surface area and pore volume of SZGO were significantly reduced compared with mSiO2 (Fig. 1e). This proved that the ZGO was formed in the channels of mSiO2. The elemental mapping images of SZGO nanoparticles also illustrated the distribution of Si, O, Zn, Ga, and Cr on SZGO (Fig. S1a†). In addition, the lattice fringes spacing of 0.254 nm on the SZGO nanoparticles was consistent with the (311) plane of cubic ZnGa2O4 (Fig. 1b insert). Also, there was obvious evidence in the XRD pattern that the peaks of SZGO matched very well with the standard card of cubic ZnGa2O4 (JSPDS #86-0415) (Fig. 1d). Also, the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra of SZGO are shown in Fig. S1b.† Briefly, the binding energies of 1045.4, 1022.2, 1145.1, and 1118.2 eV could be ascribed to the 2p1/2 and 2p3/2 states of Zn2+ and Ga3+ in tetrahedral and octahedral coordinations in the crystal structure of ZnGa2O4, respectively. These results were similar to the reported values for ZnGa2O4 (Zn 2p at 1045.3, 1022.1, and Ga 2p at 1145.2, 1118.3 eV).22 In consideration of the fact that mSiO2 may participate in the synthesis of compounds23 to replace the Ga3+ in the host by Si4+, and referring to the prior literature,24 the content of Zn2+ needs to be in excess to form the ZnGa negatively charged antisite defect to balance the charge defect of SiGa. Also, in order to ensure SZGO has optimal luminescence, samples with different Zn:Ga ratios were synthesized, and the emission spectra and decay times of the samples were examined. It was found that the luminescence intensity and decay time of the nanoparticles were optimal at the incorporation ratio of Zn:Ga = 1.1:1.9 (Fig. S2†). Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) was further performed to determine the elemental composition, and the results showed that Zn:Ga = 1.05:1.9 (Fig. S1a†).

(f–k) Elemental mapping of HSZGO. 
A series of tests were performed to verify that HKUST-1 was loaded on to the SZGO nanoparticles. First, obvious dark spots appeared on the SZGO nanoparticles according to the TEM and SEM images, which appeared on account of the generation of HKUST-1 on the SZGO nanoparticles (Fig. 1c). Also, the diameter of HSZGO was significantly larger than that of SZGO (Fig. S1e†). The XRD diffraction peak patterns matched well with the HKUST-1 and ZnGa2O4 phase with the standard PDF card. The existence of HKUST-1 (Fig. 1d) was thus verified. Also as shown in Fig. S1d,† the IR spectrum of HSZGO showed symmetric stretching of the carboxylate group at 1384 and 1405 cm−1, and the C–C bond absorption peaks appeared at 1730 to 400 cm−1, which belonged to HKUST-1 and did not appear in the IR spectra of mSiO2 and SZGO. The EDS of HSZGO also showed the distribution of the elements Si, O, Zn, Ga, C, and Cu, on the nanoparticles. It can be seen from Fig. 1f–k that the distribution of Cu2+ significantly overlapped with the ZGO nanoparticles. This also verified that the presence of ZGO was conducive to the formation of HKUST-1 on the nanoparticles. The XPS spectra results also proved the formation of HSZGO. It can be observed in Fig. S1i† that the binding energies of 934.7 eV (Cu 2p3/2) and 954.4 eV (Cu 2p1/2) belonged to Cu(II), and there were two “shake-up satellite” peaks at 943.9 at 939.9 eV, which also revealed the presence of Cu(II). The binding energies of 284.8, 286, and 288.7 eV were attributed to the C1s in the structure of HKUST-1. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) assay was performed to confirm the formation of HSZGO. After further loading with MOF material, the specific surface area of HSZGO increased to 151.2487 m2 g−1, on account of the formation of the MOF material. The nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherm of HSZGO was similar to the curves of HKUST-1.25 Then, from the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) (Fig. S1f†), it was noted that there was an evident weight loss in HKUST-1 of about 74.44% from 275 °C to 650 °C, which was due to the organic decomposition. After 650 °C, the thermal decomposition of HKUST-1 was basically completed, so the weight loss tended to be stable. Also, SZGO showed a good thermal stability in the whole heating process, and there was no obvious weight loss. The trend for the weight loss of HSZGO was similar to that of HKUST-1, but because of the presence of SZGO, the final weight loss was much smaller than for HKUST-1. The value of mSZGO:mHKUST was calculated to be about 0.45:1 (Fig. S1f†), which showed an excellent loading rate of HSZGO. All the above results verified the successful formation of HSZGO.
Luminescence performance
The luminescence properties of HSZGO were investigated first. As shown in Fig. 2a, the SZGO nanoparticles exhibited a broad emission band from 600 to 850 nm, which belonged to the 2E → 4A2 transition of Cr3+ ions26,27 under the excitation of a 254 nm lamp. The emission peaks at 696 and 710 nm were the N2 line (CrN2)28 and the Stokes phonon side bands (PSB) of Cr3+. Briefly, the emission peak at 696 nm was the zero phonon line from the Cr3+ with a neighboring antisite defect, while the other was the R line attributed to the Cr3+ in a normal spine environment.23,29,30 There were three broad excitation banks of SZGO that appeared in the UV–visible region, in which the first one belonged to the absorption of the host (O2− → Ga3+)31 and the others belonged to the charge transfer of 4A2(4F) → 4T1(4F) and 4A 2(4F) → 4T2(4F) of the doped Cr3+ ions,32–34 respectively. After loading with HKUST-1, the HSGZO nanoparticles also showed a similar strong emission peak in the near-infrared region. The coating of HKUST had some effect on the luminescence and decay time of SZGO, but the NIR PersL signals could be monitored after 30 min, which could be used for bioimaging (Fig. 2a insert). Meanwhile, the NIR luminescence of HSZGO could be rechargeably activated by a 650 nm LED. This rechargeable excitation is more suitable for bioimaging because of the tissue penetration ability. When HSZGO was dispersed in aqueous solution, a significant emission band in the NIR region could be observed under 254 nm excitation (Fig. S4a†). It can be seen from Fig. S4b† that among the excitation peaks of the solution, the peak at 260 nm was still very strong, while the other two excitation peaks were weakened to some extent, which may have been due to the quenching effect caused by the O–H vibration of water.35 In conclusion, HSZGO has the potential to be used for biological imaging because of its excellent luminescence wavelength, activation wavelength, and decay time.

(b) UV–Vis absorption spectra and XRD (insert) of HSZGO with NaHS added. 
Characterization of HSZGO with NaHS added
In order to verify the formation of CuS to be used for PTT, NaHS was used to simulate endogenous H2S in the tumor to react with the HSZGO. After NaHS was added to the HSZGO aqueous solution, the solution immediately turned brown because of the formation of CuS (Fig. 2d, inset). The precipitate in the solution was collected by centrifugation for XRD measurement to verify the formation of CuS. As the insert of Fig. 2b shows, the diffraction peaks matched well with the standard card of CuS (PDF#06-0464), which illustrated the successful generation of CuS. Also, after adding NaHS, the absorption curve appears to have obviously changed (Fig. 2b). The absorbance intensity of HSZGO + NaHS near the NIR region was significantly increased. This was because of the localized surface plasma resonances (SPR) of CuS,36 which showed a strong absorption in the NIR region. The absorbance spectra of HSZGO with NaHS added overlapped with the emission spectrum of HSZGO in the range of 700–850 nm to some extent, which may cause CuS to absorb part of the luminescence to promote photothermal effects.

In vitro and intracellular generation of ˙OH
3,3′,5,5′-Tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) was used as the peroxidase substrate to verify the generation of ˙OH. In the presence of ˙OH, it has been reported that TMB loses an electron to form TMB˙+, which could bind with another TMB molecule to generate a blue charge-transfer complex with an obvious absorption peak in the UV–vis absorption spectrum.37 The UV absorption spectra of the groups containing only HSZGO and H2O2 did not show a significant absorption peak after the addition of TMB. After different concentrations of H2O2 were add to the HSZGO aqueous solution, all of them showed a significant absorption peak at 655 nm, which proved the generation of ˙OH (Fig. 3a).

Next, 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) was used to verify the formation of intracellular ˙OH. Here, DCFH-DA would hydrolyze in the cells to form DCFH, which was without fluorescence and could retain in the cells. Also DCF, which has a strong fluorescence luminescence, was transformed as a result of the DCFH being oxidized by the intracellular reactive oxygen species. Obviously, there was no significant luminescence signal in both the PBS and H2O2 addition groups (Fig. 3b and c). After incubated with HSZGO, the cells showed a strong fluorescence, which indicated the formation of the expected ˙OH (Fig. 3d). After additional H2O2 was added, abundant ˙OH radicals were formed and resulted in the enhancement of fluorescence (Fig. 3e). The above results verified that HSZGO could be activated by intracellular catalase to form ˙OH.
Photothermal property
First, the photothermal performance of HSZGO triggered by NaHS with different concentrations was assessed (Fig. S5a†). The temperature of aqueous solution (without HSZGO) and HSZGO aqueous solution did not produce significant temperature changes under 808 nm irradiation. Relatively speaking, the temperature of the HSZGO solution was raised obviously in the presence of different concentrations of NaHS. This was similar to the trend of the temperature change curve, which showed similar changes with the increase in the content of HSZGO. When the content of HSZGO reached 0.375 mg mL−1, the heating temperature could reach more than 45 °C. Also, the maximum temperature could reach about 65 °C with the content of HSZGO up to 1 mg mL−1 (Fig. S5b†). As Fig. S5c† shows, the recorded solution temperature variation also exhibited a light power dependence under different power of an 808 nm laser. When the power density reached 2 W cm−2, the solution temperature reached about 50 °C within 5 min, and the final temperature was up to about 65 °C. It is known that irreversible cell damage would be produced by raising the cell environmental temperature to 50–55 °C for 4–6 min.38 Therefore, the photothermal property of HSZGO solution (1 mg mL−1) in the presence of NaHS (5 mM) could meet the requirement for tumor therapy under the irradiation of an 808 nm laser (2 W cm−2). The photothermal conversion efficiency (PTE) is also important to consider and is defined as the ratio of the increase in energy inside the fluid to the total incident solar radiation.39 The PTE is an important factor to appraise the photothermal performance of photothermal reagents. The PTE was evaluated by the linear time date versus Ln (θ) from the cooling period (Fig. 4a).19 The calculated PTE of HSZGO was about 58.7% (Fig. 4e), which is higher than other reported NMOF materials used for cancer therapy, like Mn-ZrMOF(28.7%),40 Cu-TCPP MOF(36.8%),41 Cu-MOF (HKUST-1) nanoenzyme (45.7%),9 Py@Ca-NDI (41.8%),42 Fe(III) porphyrin-containing MOF(41%),43 Zr-FeP MOF(33.7%),44 and Zr-Fc MOF (53%).45 The HSZGO exhibited a good and reproducible photothermal stability with slight changes in the maximum temperatures during the six light on/off cycles (Fig. 4b). Also, mSiO2@HKUST-1 was further prepared to compare the photothermal property with HSZGO. As shown in Fig. 4a, the result for mSiO2@MOF was not ideal with a PTE of 13.48%. This may be because there is a lack of direct chemical coordination groups on silica, resulting in only a limited growth of MOF on unfunctionalized silica.46–48 Since ZGO loaded with mSiO2, H3BTC could connect with the metal ions of ZGO without surface modification10 and then coordinate with Cu2+ to form more HKUST loaded on the nanoparticles, the HSZGO has a better photothermal effect than mSiO2@MOF. The interference conditions of pH values, H2O2, GSH, BSA, and L-Cys were assessed in experiments to further confirm the influence on the photothermal property of HSZGO. As Fig. S5d† shows, all of the temperature changes reached more than 20 °C, and the final temperatures exceeded 45 °C. The influence of the interference conditions was thus seemingly not critical in the simulated in vivo environments. The above results showed that HSZGO has the potential for use as a photothermal reagent for tumor therapy.

Cellular uptake of HSZGO and cytotoxicity tests
The speed of HSZGO entering in to the tumor cells could be visually evaluated by observing the NIR luminescence signal of HSZGO. The H22 tumor cells were incubated with HSZGO for different time periods, and then DAPI was added to stain the tumor cells. If HSGZO had entered the cell, the NIR luminescence signal of HSZGO would overlap with the fluorescence signal of DAPI in the cell. It can be seen from Fig. 5a that the luminescent signals were concentrated near the cell membrane after incubation for 30 min. Significantly, the fluorescence signal was enhanced when the incubation time was increased to 4 h. Over time, more and more HSZGO nanoparticles were taken in by the cancer cells and gradually targeted by endogenous H2S and H2O2, leading to the decomposition of HSZGO and the enhancement of the luminescence signals. These results demonstrated that HSZGO could be rapidly absorbed by tumor cells due to the endocytosis of cells, thus successfully introducing Cu2+ into the tumor cells.
 Fig. 5  (a) Confocal fluorescence imaging of H22 cells incubated with HSZGO for different times (all of the scale bars are 50 μm). (b) Cell viabilities of GES-1, H22, and HepG2 cells incubated with various concentrations of HSZGO (0, 0.3125, 0.625, 1.25, 2.5, 5, 10, 20 μg mL−1) for 4 h (n = 6). (c) Cell viability of H22 and HepG2 cells treated with different conditions (n = 6): cells without treatment, cells irradiated with an 808 nm laser, cells incubated with HSZGO, cells incubated with HSZGO and irradiated with an 808 nm laser. 
The CCK-8 method was used to investigate the inhibition effect on the tumor cells of HSZGO, which was “targeted-activated” by endogenous H2O2 and H2S in tumor cells. The H22, HepG2, and GES-1 cell lines were used to detect the cytocompatibility and selective inhibition of HSZGO. It was found that with the increase of HSZGO addition, the activities of H22 and HepG2 cells decreased significantly after 4 h, while the survival rate of GES-1 cells was more than 99% (Fig. 5b). The selective cytotoxicity of HSZGO was due to the intracellular Fenton-like reaction, which converted the overexpressed H2O2 into cytotoxic ˙ OH to inhibit the activity of the cancer cells. After incubation for 6 h, the tumor cell viabilities significantly dropped to about 50%, while the GES-1 cells could maintain more than 95% (Fig. S7†). Then the synergistic treatment was assessed by adding the irradiation of an 808 nm laser. The GES-1, H22, and HepG2 cells were treated with different method: (a) control (without treatment); (b) irradiated with an 808 nm laser without HSZGO; (c) HSGZO only; (d) HSZGO + 808 nm laser. As Fig. 5c shows, HSZGO showed a targeted therapy for tumor cells. Neither the 808 nm irradiation nor HSZGO alone had any effect on GES-1 cell activity. Since HSZGO was not activated in GES-1 cells, the cell activities of GES-1 incubated with HSZGO were not affected by the 808 nm irradiation. Also, after incubation, the activities of the tumor cells in the control group cells and irradiation groups could still reach more than 95%, which indicated that the irradiation of the 808 nm laser had no obvious inhabitation on the cell proliferation. In contrast, the cell viabilities of the synergistic groups were distinctly lower than the only HSZGO group and irradiation group because of the synergism of PTT and CDT. The above results indicated that HSZGO had a very obvious selective inhibitory effect on the tumor cells.

In vivo NIR PersL imaging and biodistribution evaluation
In order to investigate the potential of HSZGO for bioimaging, HSZGO (100 μL, 10 mg mL−1) PBS solution was in situ injected into KM mice after the irradiation of a 254 nm lamp for 10 min. The PersL imaging showed distinct luminescence signals in the mice, and the afterglow signal could be monitored for at least 30 min (Fig. 6a). Then, a 650 nm LED was used to recharge the nanoparticles, and also significant luminescence signals could be observed for at least 30 min (Fig. 6b). Most of the long afterglow materials could be effectively charged by UV light,49,50 while the wavelength in this area made it difficult to deep penetrate biological tissues and the light treatment could not be recharged and activated in vivo. Tissue scattering and the absorption of light with wavelengths located in the biological window wavelength range (650 nm to 950 nm) were minimized, which is a benefit for practical applications.51 These results showed that HSZHO has the potential to be used for continuous imaging in vivo, because both the re-activation and emission wavelengths were located in the biological-tissue transparency window. Then, the major organs and tumor were dissected from the H22 mice, which were intraperitoneally injected with HSZGO for 6 h, to perform fluorescence imaging in vitro to investigate the biodistribution of HSZGO. As can be seen from Fig. 6c and d, significant luminescence signals could be observed in both the liver and lung, mainly because those tissues are the primary sites for nanoparticle aggregation as the liver is the typical reticuloendothelial system.52 Also, because of the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect of nanoparticles in a solid tumor,53 HSZGO could passively accumulate at the tumor site. It was found that distinct PersL signals appeared as expected in the tumor, suggesting that HSZGO would approach the tumor and process PersL imaging. Also, the distribution of HSZGO in H22 tumor mice was evaluated by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) to measure the content of the Cu element. The H22 tumor mice injected with HSZGO for different times were sacrificed to dissect the tumors for ICP-MS measurement. The accumulation of HSZGO reached the maximum value in tumor tissue after 0.5 h injection, which indicated that the nanoparticles could quickly approach and accumulate in the tumor (Fig. 6e). Also, it could be found from the ICP-MS results that the HSZGO could be retained in the tumors after 48 h injection. After injection with HSZGO for 24 h, the major organs and tumor were dissected from the tumor-bearing mice, and the content of Cu was detected by ICP-MS. It was found that HSZGO was mainly distributed in the liver and tumor. Meanwhile, it was noteworthy that the accumulation of HSZGO in the tumors exceeded that in most organs, indicating that the accumulation capacity of HSZGO in tumors is better than in the major organs (Fig. 6f). In addition, it is meaningful to identify the long-term biodistribution of HSZGO in the main organs for biosafety. As Fig. S8† shows, after 5 days, the Cu concentration obviously decreased in the liver, spleen, and lung of healthy mice, suggesting that HSZGO could be quickly eliminated from the main organs. After 10 days, the Cu concentration in the major organs almost returned to normal. In summary, HSZGO demonstrated good accumulation capacity and a long retention time in tumor tissues. Also, in other organ tissues, the accumulation was small and the metabolism was fast, which would reduce the damage to other normal tissues. Therefore, HSZGO has a high biosafety for biological imaging and therapy.

Synergistic therapeutic effect
Tumor therapy experiments in H22 tumor-bearing mice were conducted to verify the synergistic anticancer effects of CDT and PTT of HSZGO in vivo when the tumors grew to an average size of 50–100 mm3. First, in order to evaluate the PTT treatment of HSZGO in vivo under 808 nm irradiation, the H22 tumor-bearing mice were randomly divided into three groups for the experiment (n = 5): (A) saline + 808 nm laser, (B) HSZGO + 808 nm laser, (C) S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM) + HSZGO + 808 nm laser. SAM, which was injected 12 h before the mice were injected with HSZGO, can activate the overexpressed cystathionine β-synthase (CBS, one of the catalytic enzymes for the generation of H2S in cells) in tumor cells to catalyze the formation of H2S from L-cysteine. After injecting HSZGO into the mice for 6 h, the tumor was irradiated with an 808 nm laser for 3 min. The temperature variations of the tumor were recorded by a thermal imager during illumination. The initial temperature of the tumor was higher than the other tissue because the cancer increases the blood vessel activity.54 This is a characteristic that can be used to distinguish the tumor from other organs. It can be seen from Fig. 7a and d that after being irradiated for 3 min, the temperature of the saline group only increased slightly in comparison, which illustrated that the irradiation of an 808 nm laser would not produce significant changes in the tumor temperature. In comparison, the temperature of the HSZGO and SAM + HSZGO groups increased rapidly to more than 60 °C, while the SAM + HSZGO + 808 nm laser group showed the best photothermal effect due to the endogenous H2S catalyzed by SAM reacting with HSZGO to form CuS for PTT. This phenomenon indicated that HSZGO was activated in the tumors and showed a good photothermal performance.

(c) The H&E and TUNEL staining for the tumors after treatment with different methods for 14 days. (e) The relative body weight and (f) tumor volume trends for different groups from 0 to 14 days (n = 10). 
Next, all of the H22 tumor-bearing mice were randomly divided into five groups (n = 10 per group): (A) saline, (B) saline + 808 nm laser, (C) HSZGO, (D) HSZGO + 808 nm laser, (E) SAM + HSZGO + 808 nm laser. Obviously, compared with the saline and saline + 808 nm laser groups, whose tumor volumes reached more than 10 times than its initial size, the growth of the tumor volumes in the HSZGO group mice was significantly slower (Fig. 7b and e). The tumor volume of each mouse was recorded for 14 days to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy. It was indicated that the HSZGO showed a degree of inhibition to the tumors due to the CDT of HSZGO. In particular, the tumors of the HSZGO + 808 nm laser and SAM + HSZGO + 808 nm laser groups were completely inhibited. Such a highly effective anti-tumor treatment was achieved by the combination treatment of CDT and PTT. By analyzing the recorded relative body weights of each group, no abnormal behavior appeared, which indicated that HSZGO would not produce severe side effects on the mice. Moreover, compared with the saline and saline + 808 nm groups, the H&E and TUNEL staining of tumor tissues in the other groups exhibited different degrees of large-scale tissue apoptosis (Fig. 7f). Especially in the HSZGO + 808 nm laser and SAM + HSZGO + 808 nm laser groups, the PTT-enhanced CDT treatment had an excellent killing effect on the tumor region, leading to the inhibition and necrosis of cancer cells. It can be seen from Fig. S9† that the H&E image of the major organs in each group showed no abnormalities, illustrating that HSZGO would not produce obvious toxic side effects on other organs during tumor treatment.
Conclusions
In summary, we designed and synthesized a core–shell nanoplatform, namely mSiO2@Zn1.05Ga1.9O4:Cr@HKUST-1 (HSZGO), which exhibited good PersL imaging and in situ activation for tumor treatment. HSZGO emitted distinct PersL signals after being charged by a 254 nm lamp, and could be recharged by a LED lamp. The excitation and emission of the HSZGO nanoplatform were both in the biological window wavelength range (650 nm to 950 nm), which indicated it could be used for the subcutaneous imaging of mice. When the nanoplatform enters cancer cell, it is triggered by endogenous H2S and H2O2 to activate and induce PTT and CDT to effectively inhibit the growth of liver cancer cells. Also, the temperature of the tumors in the mice rose rapidly to over 60 °C within 3 min under the irradiation of an 808 nm laser, which showed an excellent photothermal treatment effect. The synergistically treated mice were completely cured of tumors without harm to the other tissues and organs. This indicated that the nanoplatform has a very good therapeutic effect on subcutaneous tumors. Therefore, it has the potential to penetrate human skin and superficial tissues (<2.5 cm) for imaging and treating superficial tumors.
