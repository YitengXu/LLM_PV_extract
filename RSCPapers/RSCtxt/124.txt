    , Accepted 17th June 2021First published on 17th June 2021AbstractCuBi2O4 and CuWO4 films (2 × 2 cm) on an FTO substrate have been fabricated to construct an all-copper-based oxide tandem cell for solar-driven photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting. CuBi2O4 and CuWO4 films are of opposite semiconductivity, and exhibit a large difference in the onset potentials and matched light absorption, making them ideal for a tandem configuration for solar energy conversion. Under optimal conditions, the tandem cell (4 cm2) exhibits a water splitting photocurrent of 0.3 mA without an external bias under simulated solar insolation. The low cost, non-toxicity, good stability and easy manufacture of this copper-based oxide tandem cell warrant promising applications in the field of solar energy conversion.
1. Introduction
Storing solar energy directly in the form of hydrogen is a tempting route to cope with our ever-growing energy demand, particularly in the context of environmental degradation associated with the overuse of fossil fuels.1–4 As a flagship example, solar-driven water splitting based on photoelectrochemical (PEC) cells provides a tangible means to generate hydrogen at a price competitive with conventional sources (e.g. fossil fuel reforming).5–14 This refers to water cleavage at the surface of a light illuminated-semiconductor photoelectrode with or without an electrical bias, being simple and scalable from a technological viewpoint.15–22 Although PEC techniques are very promising, significant advancements in semiconductor materials are imperative to gain industrial attention, such as narrow band gap, good stability under harsh aqueous conditions, suitable band edge alignments, etc.23,24 Compared with the single absorber type PEC cell (i.e. the so-called S2 approach), the dual-absorber tandem cell (i.e. the so-called D4 approach) is more favorable due to the efficacy of the solar photon harvest.25,26 However, additional requirements of semiconductor materials arise for this dual-absorber configuration: matching of the band gap and band edge positions between two semiconductors is indispensable to maximize the PEC performance.25 Previous investigations on PEC tandem cells reveal encouraging results, including n-SrTiO3/p-GaP,27 n-GaAs/p-InP,28 n-WO3/p-Si,29etc. Nevertheless, the scarcity of their components (e.g. Ga, In) or mismatch of their band gaps prevents them from being deployed practically. Thus, there are strong incentives to develop PEC tandem cells not only comprising Earth-abundant elements but also bearing matched band structures of different semiconductors.
In this work, we have developed an all copper-based oxide tandem cell with a CuWO4 film as the photoanode and a CuBi2O4 film as the photocathode. CuWO4 and CuBi2O4 have suitable band gap values (2.2 eV–2.4 eV for CuWO4; 1.5 eV–1.8 eV for CuBi2O4),30–32 opposite semiconductivity (n-type for CuWO4; p-type for CuBi2O4),33,34 reasonably good stability under water oxidation/reduction conditions,35,36 and facile film-fabrication procedures,36–38 making them ideal for solar-driven PEC water splitting reactions. More importantly, their large differences in photocurrent onset potentials (>1 V vs. RHE for CuBi2O4, ∼0.5 V vs. RHE for CuWO4) have strong implications that PEC water splitting might be achieved without an external bias.30,36 Indeed, a stable photocurrent (∼80 μA cm−2) for water splitting with zero electric bias has been recorded for this tandem cell under simulated solar insolation.
2. Experimental
2.1. Fabrication of CuBi2O4 and CuWO4 films
All chemicals were of analytical grade and were used without further purification. CuBi2O4 and CuWO4 films on a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrate were prepared by a spin-coating method on a commercial spin coater (MODEL KW-4A, China). FTO glasses (2 × 2 cm) were ultrasonically cleaned in acetone, ethanol and deionized water sequentially three times and were dried in an oven before usage.
To prepare CuBi2O4 films, a precursor solution containing Bi and Cu was used for spin coating. This precursor solution was produced by dissolving 0.002 mol Bi(NO3)3·5H2O (99%, Aladdin) and 0.001 mol Cu(NO3)2·5H2O (99%, SCR) into 1 ml of 2-methoxyethanol. The precursor solution was magnetically stirred on a hotplate for 2 h to ensure homogeneous dissolution and dispersion of all cations. Subsequently, 40 μL of the precursor solutions were dropped onto cleaned FTO glass which was mounted in a spin coater. Spin coating was then performed at 1500 rpm for a fixed duration of 3 min. The coated FTO glass was calcined at 823 K for 1 h. The above procedures were repeated 1 to 5 times to fabricate CuBi2O4 films with different thicknesses.
To prepare CuWO4 films, the precursor solution was prepared by dissolving 0.1 mol Cu(NO3)2·5H2O (99%, SCR) and 0.1 mol (NH4)6H2W12O40·4H2O (99.5%, Aladdin) into 1 mL of ethylene glycol containing 20 μL of Triton-X 100. Magnetic stirring and heating at 373 K on a hotplate were applied to facilitate the dissolution of all chemicals. The resultant blue solution was used for spin coating. 50 μL of the precursor solution was added dropwise onto cleaned FTO glass positioned in the spin coater. A two-step spin coating method was adopted, i.e. 1000 rpm for 15 min and 2000 rpm for 10 s. The coated FTO glass was calcined at 823 K for 1 h to promote the formation of CuWO4 films.
2.2. Pt co-catalyst deposition
Pt was deposited onto CuBi2O4 films using a photodeposition method. In brief, CuBi2O4 films were immersed in H2PtCl6 aqueous solution (0.01 M). 5 mL of methanol was added to the above solution as a sacrificial agent. The films were illuminated using a 300 W xenon lamp (Perfect Light, PLX-SXE300) for 1 h to allow Pt reduction and deposition. The Pt deposited CuBi2O4 films were rinsed with deionized water three times and were dried in an oven.
2.3. Materials characterization
The as-prepared films were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques on a Bruker D8 Focus diffractometer. The incident radiation sources were Cu Kα1 (λ = 1.5406 Å) and Cu Kα2 (λ = 1.5444 Å). Data were collected at a step size of 0.01° and a duration of 0.1 s for each step. The light absorption of these films was examined using a UV–Vis spectrophotometer coupled with an integrating sphere (JASCO-750, Japan). The baseline was corrected using a Spectralon plate (JASCO, Japan) and data were analyzed using the JASCO software suite. The microstructures of the films were inspected using a field-emission scanning electron microscope (Hitachi S4800) equipped with a Mica energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS). The surface conditions of the films were further studied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo ESCALAB 250, monochromatic Al Kα source). All XPS data were adjusted according to the C 1s state at 284.7 eV.39
2.4. Photoelectrochemical (PEC) measurements
The PEC properties of the individual films (CuBi2O4 or CuWO4) were investigated first in a three electrode configuration where a fresh film, Pt foil (1 × 1 cm) and Ag/AgCl electrode were used as the working, counter and reference electrodes, respectively. The PEC performance of the tandem cell was evaluated in a two-electrode setup where CuBi2O4 and CuWO4 films served as the photocathode (front) and photoanode (back), respectively. These electrodes were connected and controlled using a Zahner electrochemical workstation at a scan rate of 20 mV s−1. 0.1 M K2HPO4/K3PO4 aqueous solution (pH = 11.66) was used as the electrolyte and buffer. A 300 W xenon lamp (Perfect Light, PLX-SXE300) coupled with an AM 1.5 filter was used to generate simulated solar insolation. Potentials were recorded and converted using the Nernst relation ERHE = ENHE + 0.0591 × pH. Electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed from 105 Hz to 0.1 Hz with an amplitude of 10 mV. The capacitance was extracted from the impedance data at a frequency of 1000 Hz and was used for Mott–Schottky analysis. Incident-photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) measurements were conducted using a 300 W xenon lamp as a light source with a monochromator (NBeT) and were calculated using eqn (1): IPCE (%) = 1240 × J/(λ × P) × 100%(1)where J = photocurrent density (mA cm−2), P = light power density (mW cm−2) at λ, and λ = wavelength of incident light (nm).
The Mott–Schottky plot was used to determine the flat band potential according to eqn (2) and (3): (2) (3)
where C is the capacitance of the photoelectrode, V is the applied bias (versus RHE), Vf is the flat band potential (versus RHE), k is Boltzmann's constant, T is the absolute temperature (K), e is the charge of an electron (C), ε is the dielectric constant of the photoelectrode, ε0 is the permittivity of a vacuum, ND is the donor density of the semiconductor (cm−3), NA is the acceptor density of the semiconductor (cm−3), and A is the photoelectrode surface area.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Phase purity and microstructures
With the help of spin-coating techniques, precursors of CuBi2O4 and CuWO4 can be easily spread homogeneously at the surface of FTO glasses, which are subsequently converted into CuBi2O4 and CuWO4 films after annealing. XRD analysis confirmed that CuBi2O4 and CuWO4 phases are formed without any impurities (Fig. S1†). Impurities (CuO, Bi2O3, and Cu0.84Bi2.08O4) can be formed during the synthesis of the CuBi2O4 film.40 However, these impurities are not observed here (Fig. S5†), probably because of the higher calcination temperature used for the synthesis. A digital photograph of the freshly prepared CuBi2O4 and CuWO4 films (2 × 2 cm) is shown in Fig. 1a. These films are colored (reddish brown for CuBi2O4 and yellow for CuWO4), and transparent with the absence of pinholes or cracks, indicating the good compatibility between the CuBi2O4/CuWO4 films and FTO substrate. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) images indicate the different morphologies of the CuBi2O4 and CuWO4 films. The surface of the CuBi2O4 film contains large pores (diameter ∼ 500 nm) which are surrounded by agglomerations of nanoparticles with a size of 100 nm (Fig. 1b). In contrast, the CuWO4 film is relatively smoother, and only small pores (diameter ∼ 50 nm) are seen (Fig. 1c). Nevertheless, both films have a comparable thickness of ∼400 nm (Fig. 1d and e). Further SEM-EDS mapping analysis suggests that all constituent elements are homogeneously distributed across the whole films (Fig. S1†), highlighting the usefulness of spin-coating techniques for facile fabrication of CuBi2O4 and CuWO4 films.

3.2. Optical and surface properties
The CuBi2O4 and CuWO4 films are further investigated by UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy to gain more information on their light absorption properties. Fig. 2a shows their UV-Vis absorption spectra which are converted from diffuse reflectance data. The CuBi2O4 film shows a quite broad absorption in the visible light region with an absorption edge as far as 650 nm. This is consistent with its reddish brown color. For the CuWO4 film, however, only an absorption tail extending up to 550 nm is observed in the visible light region. Such large differences in their light absorption are favorable for constructing a tandem configuration upon which significant amounts of solar photons can be harvested.25 The band gaps of the CuBi2O4 and CuWO4 films are then determined by Tauc plots in which direct band gaps of 1.79 eV and 2.23 eV are calculated for the CuBi2O4 and CuWO4 films, respectively. On the other hand, the surface states of semiconductors are of critical importance to their photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical performance. The surface conditions of the CuBi2O4 and CuWO4 films were therefore inspected by XPS spectroscopy techniques. A survey scan of both films was performed first in which signals from all constituent elements were present (Fig. S3†). The states of core-level electrons for individual elements are shown in Fig. 3. The signals for Bi 4f and W 4f contain two peaks due to spin–orbit coupling whose binding energy suggests the presence of Bi3+ and W6+ species.39,41,42 For the O 1s state, two overlapping peaks are resolved for both films at binding energies of around 530 eV and 532 eV. These two peaks are frequently seen in a number of metal oxides and are assignable to lattice O2− and surface hydroxyl groups (OH−),43,44 respectively. Quite interestingly, both films have a strong signal for hydroxyl groups, indicating a highly hydrophilic surface. Hydroxyl groups are involved in water splitting reactions and a semiconductor surface full of hydroxyl groups is very beneficial for PEC water splitting.45 The Cu 2p state of both films is characterized by four peaks corresponding to 2p1/2, 2p3/2 and satellite signals of Cu2+ species.32 More information about the XPS fitting can be found in Table S1.†

3.3. Photoelectrochemical (PEC) properties
The photoelectrochemical measurements were first carried out on individual films under simulated solar insolation. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) under chopped AM 1.5 illumination is shown in Fig. 4a and d. The CuBi2O4 film and CuWO4 film clearly show cathodic and anodic photocurrents under AM 1.5 illumination, respectively, being in good agreement with their p-type and n-type semiconductivities. The onset potentials for the CuBi2O4 film and CuWO4 film roughly lie at around 1.2 V and 0.8 V vs. RHE, respectively, being in good accord with previous reports.30,46 Further IPCE measurements indicate that the IPCE data of both films match well with their UV-Vis light absorption spectra, indicating real photon-driven processes (Fig. 4b–e). Depositing Pt clearly makes a positive contribution to the IPCE data which can be rationalized by the function of Pt nanoparticles that collect photogenerated electrons. Theoretically, a tandem cell made from these two films will have an optimal performance at a voltage of 0.94 V vs. RHE as can be seen from the cross-point of their LSV curves (Fig. 4c). The results are comparable to other CuBi2O4 based tandem cells47 but lower than the CdTe-based tandem system.48 It is also lower than its theoretical value17 of ∼10 mA cm−2. This is probably because fast charge recombination events in the bulk and/or at the surface of CuBi2O4/CuWO4 consume most of the photocarriers. A possible strategy to improve the photocurrent includes coating a suitable oxide layer to passivate the surface and post-treatment to strengthen the crystallinity of CuBi2O4/CuWO4.48–50 The surface charge transfer resistance was further evaluated by impedance spectroscopy analysis. Fig. 5 shows the Nyquist plot of the impedance spectra of both films in the dark and under AM 1.5 illumination with or without an electric bias (0.94 V vs. RHE). It can be seen that the surface charge transfer resistance decreases considerably upon light illumination and decreases further with the aid of an electric bias. Thus, photogenerated charges within these two films can indeed transfer to the surface and participate in water splitting reactions. Nevertheless, the CuBi2O4 film exhibits a larger surface charge transfer resistance than the CuWO4 film. We have further modified the PEC performance of the CuBi2O4 film. Firstly, the thickness of the CuBi2O4 film was varied by changing the number of spin-coating procedures (Fig. 6a). Double spin-coating procedures were found to give the highest cathodic photocurrent and were chosen for further treatment. Secondly, the amounts of the Pt cocatalyst deposited were also investigated by changing the photodeposition time. The optimal deposition time was found at 4 min which gave a cathodic photocurrent of ∼1 mA cm−2 at an electric bias of 0.6 vs. RHE (Fig. 6b). Both the LSV curves with and without Pt show sharp photocurrent spikes under light illumination (Fig. S6†). The transients reflect the surface charge recombination, which is probably induced by surface trapping states. The amounts of Pt deposited on the film were determined by SEM-EDS elemental analysis in Fig. S7.† Based on these investigations, a tandem cell was constructed with CuBi2O4 and CuWO4 films (2 × 2 cm) using the aforementioned parameters. The tandem cell (4 cm2) demonstrates a photocurrent as high as 0.3 mA under simulated AM 1.5 illumination without an external bias (Fig. 4f), and shows reasonably good stability during repeated illumination/dark cycles. XRD analysis suggests that both films are quite stable after these PEC measurements as CuBi2O4 and CuWO4 phases are maintained (Fig. S4†).

3.4. Band edge positions
The band structures of the CuBi2O4 and CuWO4 films were then investigated to validate their applicability for tandem cells. This was realized by Mott–Schottky (MS) analysis and an XPS valence band scan. Fig. 7a shows the MS plot of the CuBi2O4 and CuWO4 films. According to MS eqn (2) and (3), the slope of the MS curves, i.e. negative for CuBi2O4 and positive for CuWO4, confirms again their different types of semiconductivity, i.e. p-type for CuBi2O4 and n-type for CuWO4. Their flat band potential was determined by extrapolating the linear part of the MS curves down to the potential axis and was 1.37 V and 0.84 V vs. RHE for CuBi2O4 and CuWO4, respectively. Such a large difference in their flat band potential (0.53 V) is critical to modulate charge separation and migration within the tandem cell. Besides, the XPS valence band scan indicates that the valence band edges (VBEs) of CuBi2O4 and CuWO4 are 0.36 eV and 1.67 eV more positive than their Fermi levels (Fig. 7b), which in turn, reveals the positions of the VBEs (vs. RHE). Considering the band gap values from the Tauc plots, a full picture of their band edge alignments can be deduced which is presented in Fig. 7c. The band edges of CuBi2O4 and CuWO4 are suitably aligned so that electrons in CuWO4 and holes in CuBi2O4 can be mediated by electrical contact due to their opposite semiconductivity (i.e. the so-called D4 approach). The remaining electrons in CuBi2O4 and holes in CuWO4 can be driven to the surface and participate in water reduction and oxidation reactions.

4. Conclusions
CuBi2O4 and CuWO4 films on an FTO substrate have been successfully fabricated by spin-coating techniques. These films are in good contact with FTO and have porous microstructures with homogeneous distributions. XRD and UV-Vis absorption spectra confirm these films to be CuBi2O4 and CuWO4 phases with characteristic light absorption. XPS analysis shows that the CuBi2O4 film is highly hydrophilic which is beneficial for water splitting reactions. PEC measurements reveal the opposite semiconductivity of the CuBi2O4 and CuWO4 films. Their large difference in onset potentials and their high IPCE values signify their potential in fabricating a tandem cell. Under optimal conditions, the tandem cell (4 cm2) constructed using the CuBi2O4 film as the photocathode and the CuWO4 film as the photoanode exhibits a photocurrent of 0.3 mA without an external bias under simulated AM 1.5 illumination. The band edge positions of CuBi2O4 and CuWO4 are found to be suitably aligned so that water reduction and oxidation reactions can proceed separately at the CuBi2O4 and CuWO4 sites.
