    , Accepted 17th May 2012First published on 11th June 2012AbstractA novel small molecule-based organic donor SM [(2Z,2′Z)-3,3′-(((1E,1′E)-(2-cyclohexyl-1,3-dioxoisoindoline-4,7-diyl)bis(ethene-2,1-diyl))bis(4,1-phenylene))bis(2-(4-nitrophenyl)-acrylonitrile)] featuring 2-(4-nitrophenyl)acrylonitrile as the acceptor and a π-conjugation bridge composed of phthalimide and styryl units, with an A–π–A type structure, has been synthesized. It showed a long wavelength absorption band having an absorption maximum around 635 nm and the optical bandgap was 1.63 eV, which is lower than most reported conjugated polymers, including poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT). The photovoltaic properties were investigated by constructing bulk heterojunction organic solar cell devices using SM as the electron donor and fullerene derivatives, i.e. PC60BM and PC70BM as the electron acceptors with the device architecture ITO/PEDOT:PSS/SM:PC60BM or PC70BM/Al. The effect of the SM/fullerene derivative weight ratio and the processing solvent were carefully investigated to improve the performance of the organic solar cells. The optimized organic solar cell with SM:PC60BM and SM:PC70BM cast from THF solvent, at a weight ratio of 1:3 showed power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of about 1.70% and 2.56%, respectively. The enhanced value of PCE for the BHJ photovoltaic device based on PC70BM is related to the better absorption of PC70BM in the visible region compared to that of PC60BM. The SM:PC70BM blends cast from a DIO–THF mixture and subsequent thermal annealing exhibited improved PCEs of 3.68% and 4.14%, respectively.
1. Introduction
Organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells are promising alternatives for the silicon photovoltaics currently dominating the markets as the new generation solar cell technologies due to the fact that a large area can be fabricated with high homogeneity through low cost solution coating.1 Most of the attention has been focused on solution processed polymer bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells.2 The active layer of BHJ OPVs is the admixture of organic donor and acceptor. Fullerene and its derivatives are the best acceptors for OPVs in terms of photovoltaic performance, whereas various strategies have been reported in search of better organic and polymeric donor materials. The organic donor and acceptor strongly affect the photovoltaic performance of OPVs. A combination of polymer design, morphology control, structural insight and device engineering has led to power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) reaching 6–9% for conjugated polymer/fullerene blends.3,4a Theoretical considerations estimate the PCE limit to be between 10%4b and 15%4c for single BHJ and tandem BHJ configurations respectively.
Despite the high PCEs reported for polymer BHJ solar cells, one finds that for a given polymer structure, batch to batch variations in solubility, molecular weight, polydispersity and purity can lead to different processing properties and performance.1b In contrast, solution processed BHJ solar cells based on small molecules as electron donors have attracted much attention owing to their advantages over their polymer counterparts. The small molecules have well defined molecular structure, definite molecular weight, and high purity which do not vary between batches.5 There are also examples of small molecules that have been used as solution processable donor materials in BHJ architectures.6 However, the PCEs of solution processed small molecule organic solar cells (OSCs) are below that of their polymer counterparts. In most cases, small molecule devices using solution processing display inferior film quality to that of their polymeric counterparts. It is thus expected that the better PCE could be achieved if the intrinsic film quality and morphology in the BHJ architecture could be improved. However, in order to achieve this, careful molecule design has to be carried out to address device specific parameters simultaneously, including the materials absorption coefficient, bandgap, its highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energies, mobility and film forming quality and morphology compatibility with the acceptors and so on. The PCE of solution processed BHJ solar cells based on small molecule as the electron donor have reached up to 4.3–4.4%7 and 6.7%8 after several processing steps. The PCEs of the BHJ solar cells based on a thermally evaporated active layer have been reported as 5.2%9a and 6.4%.9b
Herein, we describe the synthesis of a small molecule (SM) with an A–π–A structure, phthalimide core and phenylenevinylene segments embedded with electron-withdrawing groups (cyano- and nitro-) on both sides. The central π-conjugation may act as a donor and allow an intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) that reduces the optical band gap (1.63 eV) of SM. We have used SM as the electron donor along with the PC60BM or PC70BM as the electron acceptor for the fabrication BHJ organic solar cells. The PCEs of the devices based on the SM:PC60BM and SM:PC70BM blends cast from THF solvent were 1.70% and 2.56%, respectively. In addition, we have investigated the effect of additive solvent used for the spin casting of the SM:PC70BM blend film on the photovoltaic response of the device and found that the device shows a PCE of about 3.68%, when the DIO–THF mixture was used for the deposition of the film. The PCE has been further improved up to 4.14% when the blend film of SM:PC70BM cast from the solvent mixture was subjected to thermal annealing.
2. Experimental
2.1 Characterization methods
FTIR spectra were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer 16PC FT-IR spectrometer with KBr pellets. 1H NMR (400 MHz) spectra were obtained with a Bruker spectrometer. The electrochemical properties, i.e. onset oxidation and reduction potentials of SM, were examined by cyclic voltammetry (CH instruments). We used an electrochemical cell with a conventional three electrode assembly and tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6) (0.1 M) acting as the electrolyte in anhydrous acetonitrile solution. The voltammetric measurements were performed at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 at room temperature. SM was deposited on the glassy carbon electrode which was used as the working electrode, while a Pt wire and an Ag/AgCl electrode were used as the counter and reference electrodes, respectively. The optical absorption spectra of the pure SM (in solution and thin film) and blended films were measured using a Perkin Elmer UV-Vis spectrophotometer.
The crystallinity of the thin films was studied using the X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique (panalytical make, USA) having CuKα, as radiation source of wavelength λ = 1.5405 Å with the film coated on quartz substrate.

2.3 Computational methods
We have performed theoretical calculations to understand the electronic structure of the functional materials by using the Gaussian 09W (Revision-A.02) program suite.13 The geometries of the dyes in vacuum were optimized using density functional theory (DFT)14 with the hybrid B3LYP15 density functional and the 6-31G* basis set. All optimized geometries were subjected to vibrational analysis, and characterized as a minimum (no imaginary frequencies). The time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT)14 at the level of B3LYP/6-31G* was further carried out to determine at least 10 vertical excitations to the excited state of the molecules. The computation in THF was performed by applying the polarizable continuum model (PCM) using the integral equation formalism variant (IEFPCM) to describe the electrostatic solute–solvent interactions by the creation of solute cavity via a set of overlapping spheres.16 The absorption spectra were simulated using the 10 lowest spin-allowed singlet transitions, mixed Lorentzian–Gaussian lineshape (0.5) and an average full-width at half maximum (3000 cm−1) for all peaks.17,18
2.4 Device fabrication and characterization
Photovoltaic devices were fabricated with ITO coated glass as the positive electrode and Al as the negative electrode. The patterned indium tin oxide (ITO) glass substrate was pre-cleaned in an ultrasonic bath of acetone and isopropanol and then dried at room temperature. A thin layer (60 nm) of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS, Bayon, Germany) was spin coated onto the ITO glass and baked at 100 °C for 20 min. A tetrahydrofuran (THF) solution of blend SM:PC60BM or PC70BM (1:2, 1:3, 1:4, w/w) was subsequently spin coated on the PEDOT:PSS layer to form a photoactive layer. The thickness of the photoactive layer is about 80–85 nm. The deposition of all organic layers was carried out in ambient atmosphere. An aluminum (Al) was then evaporated onto the surface of the photoactive layer under vacuum of 10−5 Torr. The active area of the device is about 5 mm2. The current–voltage characteristics of the device was measured with a computer controlled Keithley 238 source meter unit. A halogen lamp coupled with AM1.5 solar spectrum filters was used as the light source and the optical power at the surface of device was 100 mW cm−2. All the measurements were also carried out in ambient conditions.
The thin film of the blend was cast from mixed solvent and is described as follows: the blend of the solution of SM:PC70BM (1:3 w/w) was first prepared using THF solvent and stirred for 4 h. A 0.5 mL of 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) was added to the SM:PCBM solution prepared from the THF solvent and stirred for another 2 h. The pre-thermal annealing of the active layer was carried out at 110 °C for 2 min on a hot plate before the deposition of final Al electrode. The performances presented here are the average of the four pixels of each device.
The incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) of the devices was measured using a monochromator and 100 W halogen lamp as light source. The resulting current was measured with computer controlled Keithley electrometer (model 6514), under short circuit conditions. The intensity for each wavelength was kept constant.
Hole or electron only devices were fabricated using the configurations: ITO/PEDOT:PSS/SM:PC70BM/Au for holes and Al/SM:PC70BM/Al for electrons. Mobilities are extracted by fitting the current–voltage curves using the Mott–Gurney relationship (space charge limited current).19
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Synthesis of SM
The synthesis of SM is shown in Scheme 1 and characterized by FTIR and NMR spectra. The terminal groups at both sides of the SM (left and right) behave as electron acceptor units, since it contains the nitro and cyano groups. The SM was characterized by FTIR and NMR spectra. The central phthalimide unit is a π-conjugated segment and the cyclohexyl ring is attached to the central unit to enhance the solubility. It is expected that the conjugated phthalimide unit will behave as an electron donating group. Therefore, this SM can be represented as A–π–A or A–D–A small molecule.

3.2 Theoretical computations
The computed vertical excitation and frontier orbital energies, oscillator strengths for electronic excitations and compositions of vertical transitions in terms of molecular orbitals are listed in Table 1. The electronic distributions observed for selected molecular orbitals contributing significantly to the prominent electronic excitations in the dyes are presented in Fig. 1. The simulated absorption spectra in vacuum and THF phase are shown in Fig. 2. For the dye SM in tetrahydrofuran, two prominent absorptions with the peak positions at 550 and ∼410 nm are predicted from the computations. The lower energy absorption at 550 nm corresponds to the HOMO to LUMO transition while the shorter wavelength peak originates due to HOMO to LUMO+2 and HOMO−1 to LUMO+1 excitations. The HOMO, HOMO−1 and LUMO are π-type orbitals and delocalized over the entire molecule, however the nitro groups do not participate in the construction of HOMO and HOMO−1. The LUMO+2 is mainly contributed by the phthalimide and nitro units and can be described as an acceptor orbital. In view of the observed electronic distributions of the participating orbitals, the longer wavelength absorption may be described as a π–π* transition while the shorter wavelength absorption may originate from the electronic migration from the delocalized π-segment to the nitro/phthalimide units (cf. HOMO to LUMO+2 contribution to this transition). The high oscillator strengths observed for the π–π* transition appearing at a longer wavelength is consistent with the extended π-delocalization present in the molecular orbitals.

3.3 Optical and electrochemical properties

Fig. 3 presents the UV-visible absorption spectra of SM in both dilute (10−5 M) THF solution and a thin film. These spectra were normalized by their long wavelength absorption peak. In the solution, the short wavelength maximum (λmax) appeared at approximately 495 nm, corresponding to the n–π* transition. The absorption band in the longer wavelength region has been assigned to the intra-molecular charge transfer (ICT) between the acceptor unit and central donor unit in the SM. The thin film onset of the absorption SM was found at 760 nm, which corresponds to an optical band gap about 1.63 eV. It has been well established in our earlier communication that the presence of cyanovinylene 4-nitrophenyl terminal moieties affects the absorption spectra of the compounds by significant redshift and broadening.20

In order to evaluate the electrochemical properties of the SM, cyclic voltammetry was performed in a 0.1 M solution as described in the experimental part. The CV curve was recorded in reference to the Ag/AgCl reference electrode, which is calibrated using the ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) redox couple (4.7 eV below the vacuum level) as an external standard. The SM exhibited a oxidation peak with onset potential (Eoxonset) and reduction peak with onset potential (Eredonset) of 0.6 V and −1.35 V (versus Ag/AgCl), respectively. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels were determined to be −5.3 eV and −3.35 eV, respectively, from the corresponding Eoxonset and Eredonset according to following equations21EHUMO = −q(Eoxonset + 4.7) eVEHUMO = −q(Eredonset + 4.7) eV
The results of energy levels of the SM are also listed in Table 2. The electrochemical band gap of SM is estimated to be 1.95 eV, which very close to the value estimated from the DFT calculations, which is also listed in Table 2. The electrochemical band gap is higher than that estimated from the optical absorption spectra (1.63 eV) which are due to the exciton binding energy of the organic material. This is the common phenomena observed in most of the organic semiconductors as reported in the literature.22

It is important to note that the HOMO level of the SM is greater than that of P3HT,23 which indicates that the present SM has better oxidative stability as compared to P3HT. In addition, the LUMO energy level of SM is well aligned with the LUMO levels of PCBMs24 (Fig. 4) with energy difference >0.3 eV, indicating that the generated excitons can effectively be dissociated at the interface between the SM and PCBMs.25 Since open circuit of BHJ organic solar cell is determined by the difference between the HOMO level of the donor and LUMO level of the acceptor, the HOMO energy level of the related donor molecules in the bulk heterojunction photovoltaic cell is very important for a high efficiency device.26 Obviously it is expected that with a relatively low HOMO level (−5.3 eV) compared with P3HT, this SM may favor for the improvement of the Voc on construction of a BHJ photovoltaic device with fullerene derivatives as the acceptor.

3.4 Photovoltaic properties

Fig. 5 shows the thin film absorption spectra of SM:PC60BM and SM:PC70BM blends. The film absorption of the blends shows two bands i.e. one in the shorter wavelength region corresponding to fullerene derivatives and another in the longer wavelength region corresponding to SM. A broader absorption through the whole solar spectrum is observed for the SM:PC70BM blend as compared to the SM:PC60BM blend and this has been attributed to the absorption of PC70BM.27a The broader absorption spectrum of SM:PC70BM indicates higher light harvesting efficiency and exciton generation for the photovoltaic device.
 Fig. 5  Optical absorption spectra of SM:PC60BM and SM:PC70BM blends in thin film form. 
To explore the photovoltaic performance of the SM, bulk heterojunction OSCs were fabricated using SM as the electron donor and fullerene derivatives PC60BM or PC70BM as the electron acceptor with a device architecture ITO/PEDOT:PSS/SM:PC60BM or PC70BM/Al. We have fabricated devices with different SM/fullerene weight ratios and found that the optimum blend ratio is 1:3 (w/w) for both SM:PC60BM and SM:PC70BM. The current–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the devices under illumination of 100 mW cm−2, based on SM as the donor and PC60BM or PC70BM as the electron acceptor are shown in Fig. 6 and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters i.e. short circuit current (Jsc), open circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF) and power conversion efficiency (PCE) are summarized in Table 3. The device with SM:PC60BM provided a Voc of 0.86 V, a Jsc of 4.5 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.44, resulting in a PCE of 1.70%. In contrast, the device based on SM:PC70BM with the same weight ratio, shows higher photovoltaic performance with a Voc of 0.86 V, a Jsc of 6.2 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.48, yielding a PCE of 2.56%. The increase in the PCE is mainly due to the enhancement of the Jsc and Voc for both the devices. The same value of Voc is related to the same LUMO level for the both PC60BM and PC70BM.

The incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the BHJ devices has been investigated to get information on the contributions of the SM and PC60BM or PC70BM to photocurrent generation. The values IPCE have been estimated from following expressionIPCE(λ) = 1240Jsc/λPinwhere Jsc is the photocurrent in the short circuit condition, Pin and λ are the illumination intensity and wavelength of the monochromatic incident light, respectively. The IPCE spectra of the devices are shown in Fig. 7. It can be seen from this figure that the IPCE spectra of the devices closely resemble the absorption spectra of the respective BHJ active layer indicating that both donor and acceptor components employed in the BHJ active layer contribute in photocurrent generation. It is noted that the IPCE values for the device based on PC70BM as the electron acceptor, in the wavelength region below 560 nm, are higher than that for device based on PC60BM as the electron acceptor. This could be ascribed to higher photon absorption by PC70BM as compared to PC60BM, in the wavelength region below 560 nm.

PC70BM has more absorption in the visible region than PC60BM. Therefore, under identical device conditions, PC70BM also contributes to the generation of excitons and may result more photocurrent. Since the LUMO levels of both PC60BM and PC70BM lie at same energy level, the Voc of the devices remain same for both devices. Indeed, after changing the electron acceptor from PC60BM to PC70BM, a higher Jsc value was obtained due to the higher absorption coefficient of PC70BM in the visible region.27 The Jsc strongly depends on the number of excitons generated in the photoactive layer of the device and their dissociation into free charge carriers at the interfaces, which is directly related to the optical absorption spectra of the photoactive layer. The stronger absorption of PC70BM in the visible region than PC60BM, which may contribute to more excitons and charge generation in the SM:PC70BM based device than in the SM:PC60BM device. The large number of generated excitons is likely one of the main reasons for the enhanced Jsc in the SM:PC70BM device.
In addition to two different fullerene derivatives, the variation of solvent was also considered for further improvement of the photovoltaic performance of the device. The choice of the solvent can greatly affect the morphology of the active layer and thus influence the overall PCE of the photovoltaic device.28 An additive solvent approach has been shown to be effective in several polymers.29 This approach has also been successfully applied to solution processable BHJ solar cells based on small molecules: fullerene derivatives30 and planar heterojunction solar cells.31 Since the device based on PC70BM as electron acceptor shows higher PCE, we have investigated the effect of mixed solvent and subsequent thermal annealing on the photovoltaic performance of device based on SM:PC70BM blend. The J–V characteristics of BHJ organic photovoltaic device cast from additive solvent (DIO–THF) is shown in Fig. 8 and photovoltaic parameters are compiled in Table 3. The Jsc and FF of the photovoltaic device cast from DIO–THF additive solvent has been increased to 8.13 mA cm−2 and 0.54, respectively, resulting in an overall PCE of 3.68%. The PCE has been further increased up to 4.14%, when the SM:PC70BM blend cast from mixed solvent is thermally annealed before the deposition of Al electrode. The increase in the PCE has been attributed to the increase in the crystallinity of the blend cast from the DIO–THF additive solvent, and more balanced charge transport in the device.

The optical absorption spectra of the as cast and thermally annealed SM:PC70BM blend cast from DIO–THF additive solvent are shown in Fig. 9. As shown in Fig. 5, the blend SM:PC70BM, cast from THF only shows an absorption band in longer wavelength region centered at 635 nm, corresponding to SM. The absorption spectrum of the SM:PC70BM blend cast from additive solvent, the absorption peak corresponding to SM shifts towards the higher wavelength region and also the absorption coefficient increases, indicating the increase in degree of SM crystallinity due to the enhanced interchain π–π* stacking. Fig. 8 clearly shows that the further redshift in the absorption band corresponding to SM. The additional application of thermal annealing associated with mixed solvent cast film allowed the film to crystallize more extensively, as indicated by the increased absorption coefficient and prominent redshift. The improved crystallinity of SM, facilitated through self-organized chain stacking, can enhance the light harvesting capabilities, improving the Jsc.

The IPCE spectra of the devices based on as the cast and thermally annealed active layer cast from mixed solvent display broader IPCE spectral band that cast from THF solvent (Fig. 10). The values of IPCE in the longer wavelength region further increased when the active layer cast from mixed solvent was thermally annealed. The red shift in the IPCE spectra which agreed with the absorption spectra of the blend films was interpreted as arising from the enhanced crystallinity of the SM, resulting higher hole mobility. The enhanced values of IPCE and PCE of the devices based on mixed solvent and additional thermal annealing is mainly due the increase in photocurrent.

To gain a better understanding of the crystalline blend, we have recorded the X-ray diffraction (XRD) on the spin cast thin of pristine SM and SM:PC70BM cast from THF and DIO–THF additive solvent. Fig. 11 shows the XRD patterns of SM cast from THF and DIO–THF additive solvent. The pristine SM cast from THF and DIO–THF additive solvent show same XRD band with a peak at 2θ = 7.2°, but the intensity of the peak significantly increased, when the film cast from the mixed solvent. This indicates the crystallinity of the film has been increased. However, when the SM is blended with PC70BM, the diffraction peak corresponds to at 2θ = 7.2° becomes weak, suggesting an effective mixing of PC70BM with SM. When the blend is cast from the mixed solvent, the diffraction peak centered at 2θ = 7.2° reappears. This indicates that the film cast from the THF solvent was not sufficiently crystallized. Moreover, the blend cast from additive solvent and subsequent thermal annealing, the intensity of this peak is further increased (as shown in Fig. 11b). This indicates that the thermally annealing further increases the film crystallinity. These changes in film crystallinity after thermal annealing agree with optical absorption data.

Another important factor that is responsible for the increased Jsc is the charge transport in the active layer. To obtain efficient charge transport of carriers in the photoactive layer of the device, it is necessary to enhance both te electron and hole mobilities. The space charge limited current (SCLC) method was employed to estimate the hole and electron mobilities of the devices prepared from the as cast and thermally annealed films cast from DIO–THF additive solvent.20,32 The hole and electron mobilities were estimated from the J–V characteristics of the hole and electron only devices, respectively and fitting the data in SCLC region. The current in the SCLC region is described as follow:JSCLC = (9ε0εrμV2/8d3)exp[0.891γ(V/d)0.5]where ε0εr represents the permittivity of the material, μ is the mobility of electron or hole, γ is the field activation factor, d is the thickness of the active layer and V is the effective voltage i.e. Vappl − Vbi (Vbi is the built in potential and Vappl is the applied voltage). The hole mobility of the film cast from THF, DIO–THF additive solvent and thermally annealed film cast from the additive solvent are 4.8 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1, 1.2 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, and 6.5 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 respectively. The electron mobility has been slightly increased, when the device is fabricated from the additive solvent and subsequently thermally annealed. Therefore, the addition of DIO (additive solvent) and thermal annealing increases both electron and hole mobilities, but the degree of increase is more in the hole mobility. For the balance charge transport, the ratio between the electron and hole mobilities should be unity. With the increase of hole mobility, the ratio between the electron and hole mobilities is reduced, resulting in more balanced charge transport in the device cast from the mixed solvent as compared to the THF cast film. The hole mobility in the device fabricated from THF solvent was insufficient to ensure efficient charge transport as well as the hole and electron mobilities were less balanced than those measured for the thin film cast from mixed solvent and thermally annealed film cast from mixed solvent. The increase in the hole mobility for the thin film cast from the additive solvent may be due to the increased crystallinity of the blend, which is further enhanced by the thermal annealing of the blend as has been evidenced by the absorption spectrum and XRD patterns for the films.
4. Conclusions
In summary, we have synthesized and characterized small molecule SM based on cyclohexyl ring as the central core donor unit, with an A–D–A type molecular structure. This small molecule showed a long wavelength absorption maximum at 635 nm and a low optical band gap of 1.63 eV. HOMO and LUMO levels estimated from DFT calculations and cyclic voltammetry data closely match and are suitable for an electron donor along with fullerene derivatives as the electron acceptor, for the fabrication of BHJ solar cell. The BHJ solar cell based on SM:PC60BM and SM:PC70BM (cast from THF solution) showed PCEs of 1.70% and 2.56%, respectively. The higher value of PCE for the device based on PC70BM as electron acceptor is attributed to the better absorption capability of PC70BM in the visible region, resulting in high Jsc. We have also investigated the effect of additive solvent and subsequent thermal annealing on the performance of the BHJ devices based on SM:PC70BM. The PCE of the device has been significantly enhanced which is mainly due to the increase in Jsc and FF. The crystallization of the SM:PC70BM blend was significantly enhanced by spin casting from the additive solvent as has been evidenced by the absorption spectrum and XRD pattern for the films. The improved crystallinity with the additive solvent cast and thermally annealed blend yields a PCE of 3.68% and 4.14%, respectively. The improved PCE of the BHJ photovoltaic devices has been also been attributed to the improved charge transport, as evidenced from the increase in charge carrier mobility.
