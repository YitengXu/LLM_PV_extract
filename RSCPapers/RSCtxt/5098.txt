, Accepted 26th May 2023First published on 12th July 2023AbstractWhen designing photoelectrochemical cells with highly efficient and durable Si photocathodes, it is desirable to develop stable and active catalysts that enhance the charge carrier dynamics in the photocathode. Thus, we report the fabrication of a nickel–graphene core–shell catalyst through thermal chemical vapor deposition and its application to an Si photocathode for photoelectrochemical water splitting. The obtained nickel–graphene core–shell catalyst is composed of nickel particles as the core and a high-quality graphene monolayer as the shell. The synergistic effect between nickel and graphene in the core–shell structure could promote the photocarrier transfer process within the system. Thus, the as-prepared p-Si/Ni–Gr core–shell photocathode exhibits excellent PEC performance and durability with a high photocurrent density of −48 mA cm−2 at −1.2 V (vs. RHE) over 50 hours. The strategy of adopting this novel catalyst provides a new approach for improving photocatalytic hydrogen production.
1. Introduction
The utilization of renewable solar energy via direct conversion to chemical energy is an ideal way to address energy and environmental issues.1 Therefore, solar energy-assisted photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting to produce hydrogen fuel has attracted substantial attention as a next-generation renewable energy source to replace traditional fossil fuels.2
Many efficient semiconductor materials have been used as photoelectrodes in PEC systems, such as titanium dioxide (TiO2),3,4 gallium nitride (GaN),5,6 ferric oxide (Fe2O3),7 niobium pentoxide (Nb2O5),8,9 zinc oxide (ZnO),10,11 tungsten trioxide (WO3),12–15 copper(I) oxide (Cu2O),16,17 and nickel(II) oxide (NiO).18,19 Among them, p-type Si is the most promising material for photoelectrodes in a PEC water-splitting system mainly due to its suitable bandgap (1.12 eV) for extracting energy from the solar spectrum and being highly earth-abundant, which makes it a relatively cheaper resource than other semiconductor materials.20–22 Unfortunately, the practical application of Si suffers from photoanodic corrosion and is limited by its need for additional overpotential to overcome the kinetic barrier associated with water splitting at the electrode/electrolyte interface. Therefore, various efforts have been employed to solve these problems by using cocatalysts, which can facilitate charge separation, prevent charge recombination, and reduce the activation energy for proton reduction.
Pt and Au are considered to be extremely good cocatalysts due to their excellent catalytic activity.23–26 However, due to them being rare and expensive, relatively cheaper transition metals such as Cu, Ni, and Co and their corresponding oxides, all of which are earth-abundant and stable, have been considered as cocatalysts.27–29 Nevertheless, these transition metals are difficult to purify and become partially oxidized easily. Moreover, they sometimes dissolve in the reaction solution, resulting in photocorrosion and deactivation. Therefore, it is desirable to design unique and stable structures to protect cocatalysts from the external environment.
These problems could be resolved by employing carbon nanomaterials, which are inexpensive, earth-abundant, and highly conductive. Among numerous carbon materials, graphene (Gr) comprising a thin layer of sp2-hybridized carbon atoms possesses the merits of superior carrier mobility, good electrical conductivity, and abundant surface functional groups.30–34 It can enhance the photocatalytic performance of semiconductors by improving charge separation and increasing the active adsorption sites together with the reaction centers.35,36 At the same time, graphene layers can protect metal particles from corrosion during the catalytic reaction process.
Lately, encapsulating transition metal particles in graphene and graphene-based hybrid materials has been extensively studied in various fields.37–43 For example, Narwade et al.44 fabricated nickel/nickel oxide on reduced graphene oxide (Ni/NiO@rGO). It demonstrated a low overpotential of 582 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm−2 and a smaller Tafel slope of 63 mV dec−1 obtained in 0.5 M H2SO4 towards the HER. Dong et al.45 prepared hierarchical bimetallic Ni–Co phosphide hollow spheres encapsulated in P-doped reduced graphene oxide (PrGO) as an electrocatalyst. It exhibits a low overpotential of 106 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm−2 and a Tafel slope of 58.3 mV dec−1 in 1 M KOH electrolyte.
So far, most approaches have been to wrap the surface of the metal grains piece by piece using Gr oxide and mildly reduced Gr oxide.46–52 However, the thickness of Gr oxide prevents the catalytic properties of the metal from being completely realized due to scattering at the contact surfaces between them.
Thus, we prepared a Ni–Gr core–shell catalyst (metal Ni particles encapsulated in a high-quality Gr monolayer) that combines the advantages of Ni and Gr and concurrently utilizes the complex function with two or more properties. Furthermore, the PEC performance of the Ni–Gr core–shell anchored on p-Si was accurately identified in this work and displayed excellent hydrogen production.
2. Experimental
2.1 Synthesis of the Ni–Gr core–shell catalyst
To this end, 0.5 g of 1 μm Ni powder (ALDRICH, 99.8%) was placed in an alumina boat by using thermal chemical vapor deposition (TCVD). While flows of 80 sccm of hydrogen and 300 sccm of Ar were applied to achieve atmospheric pressure, the temperature was raised to 800 °C for 1 h, maintained at 800 °C for 30 min followed by passing 30 sccm of methane through for 5 min, and then cooled to room temperature.
After synthesizing the Gr-coated Ni core–shell, spin-coating was used to uniformly apply it to a Si substrate. A solution of 10 ml of deionized water and 0.5 g of Gr-coated Ni core–shell was dropped onto an Si substrate and rotated at 3000 rpm for 45 s, followed by rapid temperature annealing at 550 °C to remove any residual deionized water.
2.2 Characterization
The thickness, size, and morphology of the powders were investigated by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM; Hitachi S-4800) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM; JEOL JEM-2100F). The crystal structures of the powders were investigated by conducting X-ray diffraction (XRD; Malvern PANalytical Empyrean) analysis at the Energy Convergence Core Facility in Chonnam National University, South Korea. The number and orientation of the sample layers, as well as the quality and types of edges in the sample, were analyzed by Raman spectroscopy (FLEX G, Tokyo Instruments). The elemental composition and oxidation states of the carbon and Ni atoms in the samples were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS; Thermo Scientific K-alpha). Optical reflectance data are obtained using a UV-vis spectrometer (Shimadzu, UV-2450).
2.3 PEC measurements
The PEC water-splitting performance was measured by using a potentiostat Parstat 4000 (AMETEK Princeton Applied Research). The PEC cell consisted of fabricated photocathodes as the working electrode, Ag/AgCl/KCl as the reference electrode, and Pt wire as the counter electrode. 0.5 M sulfuric acid (H2SO4) solution was used as the electrolyte for investigating the water-splitting performance. Photoresponse was measured under simulated AM 1.5 G illumination (100 mW cm−2) using a 300-W Xe arc lamp (Newport). The Ag/AgCl potential was transformed into reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) potential by adding 0.2324 V according to the Nernst equation (ERHE = EAg/AgCl + 0.059 pH + 0.196). Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves were recorded over the potential range of 0 to −1.3 V (vs. RHE) at a scan rate of 20 mV s−1 at ambient temperature. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed at −0.8 V (vs. RHE) with 20 mV amplitude in the frequency range of 10 kHz to 1 Hz. Mott–Schottky (M–S) plots for evaluating the capacitance behavior were obtained via DC potential polarization under the dark condition; the potential range was −0.7 to +1.4 V (vs. RHE) with steps of 20 mV at a frequency of 1 kHz. Long-term stability of the photocathodes was carried out under illumination at −1.2 V vs. RHE for 50 h.
3. Results and discussion
The Ni–Gr core–shell hybrid was obtained through facile TCVD after optimizing the process (Fig. 1(a)). The size and morphology of the synthesized particles were characterized by SEM and TEM. The SEM images in Fig. 1(b) and (c) indicate that the 1 μm-diameter Ni powder particles were coated with a Gr monolayer in a core–shell (∼1.2 μm). Fig. 1(d) and (e) present TEM images that provide further insight into the Ni–Gr core–shell in which it is easy to distinguish between the Ni and Gr due to the difference in brightness: the black area is the Ni powder particle and the gray area is the Gr monolayer. It can be seen that the round grains of amorphous carbon (a-C) on the transparent nanometer-thick layer of Gr are entangled at the edges of the Ni powder. These are formed during the graphene synthesis process due to bulk gas-phase reactions in the stagnant gas to form a carbon layer on the Ni surface inside the boat.53 The SEM and TEM images show that the Ni–Gr core–shell was synthesized by wrapping each Ni metal grain in a single layer of Gr rather than piece by piece.

Fig. 2(a) shows an XRD pattern of the as-prepared Ni–Gr core–shell with prominent peaks at the 2θ = 44.5°, 51.9°, and 75.9°, which were assigned to the (111), (200), and (220) crystal planes of Ni (JCPDS card no. 70-1849).54 Various crystal direction signals were obtained owing to the Ni–Gr core–shell being a powder. No peak corresponding to Gr was observed in the C 1s XRD pattern in Fig. 2(a) because the Gr monolayer surrounding the Ni particle was very thin.

Fig. 2(b) shows Raman spectra of the Ni–Gr core–shell, in which peaks at positions 2700 and 1560 cm−1 correspond to the 2D- and G-bands of Gr, respectively: the 2D-band is due to vibrations occurring in the hexagonal structure of Gr while the G-band is due to the π–orbital of the carbon atoms in the Gr.55 The appearance of the 2D- and G-bands confirm the presence of Gr at the edge of the Ni–Gr core–shell while the absence of the D-band at 1350 cm−1 representing irregular vibrations due to defects in the Gr structure indicates that the Gr was of high quality with very few defects. Moreover, the graphene layer can be inferred from the ratio of the 2D- and G-band intensities (I2D/IG) because the 2D-band decreases due to the more vertical interactions between the Gr layers when their number increases56 The I2D/IG ratio of 2.2:1 due to the monolayer of Gr is in very good agreement with the TEM images in Fig. 1(d) and (e).
We performed XPS to identify the chemical bonds formed in the Ni–Gr core–shell. The survey spectra (Fig. 3(a)) illustrate the presence of only C, O and Ni elements in the Ni–Gr core–shell. The C 1s and Ni 2p deconvoluted core spectra of C and Ni are shown in Fig. 3(b) and (c), respectively. The C 1s core-level spectrum exhibited multiplets with a sharp peak at 284.63 eV along with two broad peaks at 285.17 and 285.54 eV corresponding to sp2 bonded carbon (CC), epoxide (C–O), and carboxyl functional groups (CO), respectively.57 The highly intense CC peak suggests the presence of Gr but not Gr oxide. Furthermore, the C–O and CO peaks suggest the functionalization of the Ni–Gr core–shell with oxygen-containing functional groups. This functionalization can contribute to the number of catalytic active sites, electron channeling, and long-term stability for hydrogen production. In the Ni 2p core-level spectrum, two strong peaks observed at binding energies at 855.9 and 873.4 eV correspond to Ni 3p/2 and Ni 2p1/2, respectively.58 Two shake-up satellite peaks at 861.6 and 879.6 eV can be attributed to oxidized species formed on the surface of the sample due to inevitable contact with air. The results of the XPS analysis prove that the Ni–Gr core–shell is composed of Ni and C elements, indicating the absence of impurities. From the above discussion, it is clear that high-quality Gr encapsulated the Ni particles.

Afterward, the Ni–Gr core–shell was loaded on the p-Si substrate by using a spin coating method (p-Si/Ni–Gr core–shell). UV-vis reflectance spectra of p-Si and the p-Si/Ni–Gr core–shell were measured to illustrate their optical properties. According to optics, absorbance is indirectly proportional to the reflectance of light. As shown in Fig. 4(a), the reflectivity of the bare silicon surface was around 60% and decreased to around 15% after introducing the Ni–Gr core–shell, which shows an obvious change in optical absorption. The p-Si/Ni–Gr core–shell lowers the light reflectivity and thus enhances the light absorption, which might be favored to promote the PEC performance.
To investigate the PEC performance for water splitting, linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was conducted with a three-electrode cell system in 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte under simulated 1 sun illumination. Fig. 4(b) shows the LSV curves of p-Si and the p-Si/Ni–Gr core–shell under chopped illumination; this photoinduced cathodic current results from the reduction of protons involving the photogeneration of electrons and reveals the p-type nature of the Si layer. The photocurrent density of the p-Si/Ni–Gr core–shell was −48 mA cm−2 at −1.2 V (vs. RHE), which was ∼1.5 times greater than that of p-Si (−33 mA cm−2). The onset potential of the p-Si/Ni–Gr core–shell occurred at −0.25 V vs. RHE, which is more positive than that of bare p-Si (−0.45 V vs. RHE).

(b) LSV under chopped light (the inset shows images of the photocathodes), (c) calculated applied bias photo-to-current efficiency (ABPE) efficiency curves, (d) incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) plots, (e) Nyquist plots, and (f) Mott–Schottky plots as a function of potential vs. RHE of samples. 
In addition, the applied bias photo-to-current efficiency (ABPE) of p-Si and the p-Si/Ni–Gr core–shell (a diagnostic measurement to assess the photocathode) was calculated as follows:59 
(1)where jph is the photocurrent density obtained under applied bias Vapp between the working and the counter electrodes, Vredox is the redox potential for hydrogen production (0 V), and Plight is the incident light intensity (100 mW cm−2). In Fig. 4(c), it can be seen that the p-Si/Ni–Gr core–shell (0.09%) exhibited a higher ABPE than that of p-Si (0.06%). Hereafter, the incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) was also measured to determine the photocatalytic activity based on the incident photon and calculated using the following formula. 
(2)where jph is the photocurrent density at a particular wavelength, λ is the wavelength of the incident light, and Plight is the optical power density. Fig. 4(d) presents IPCE analyses of the fabricated photocathodes of p-Si and the p-Si/Ni–Gr core–shell. All the samples show evident IPCE peaks from 400 to 800 nm approximately which is consistent with the UV-vis reflectance spectra in Fig. 4(a). The IPCE values of p-Si were enhanced after the Ni–Gr core–shell introduction. Specifically, the p-Si/Ni–Gr core–shell shows the highest values in the wavelength ranging from 500 to 600 nm. The maximum value is about 25.8% at the wavelength of 550 nm, whereas the p-Si shows 19.4%. The IPCE analyses suggested that the p-Si/Ni–Gr core–shell can efficiently utilize photogenerated electrons as compared with p-Si.
Impedance measurements were conducted to investigate in-depth the charge transfer kinetics at the electrode/electrolyte interface. Fig. 4(e) shows Nyquist plots for bare p-Si and the p-Si/Ni–Gr core–shell, in which both photocathodes exhibit two semicircles. The semicircles in the high-frequency range reflect the predominant charge transfer process in the depletion layer of the semiconductor while the one in the low-frequency range reflects the charge transfer process across the double layer at the semiconductor/electrolyte interface.60 In the case of the p-Si/Ni–Gr core–shell, the semicircles in the low- and high-frequency ranges are smaller than those of the bare p-Si, thereby indicating lower charge transfer resistance related to the kinetic barrier energy for the hydrogen production reaction. Therefore, the Ni–Gr core–shell promotes hydrogen production by reducing the charge transfer resistance across the double layer. Moreover, the smaller charge transfer resistance in the semiconductor depletion layer is correlated to higher band bending.
M–S analysis was employed to investigate the interface energetics of p-Si covered with the Ni–Gr core–shell, as shown in Fig. 4(f); the flat band potential (Efb) values were evaluated from the x-axis intercepts of the Mott–Schottky plots while the donor concentration (ND) of each photocathode was calculated as follows:61 
(3) 
(4)where εr, ε0, and A are the relative permittivity (11.68), vacuum permittivity (8.854 × 10−12 F m−1), and surface area (cm2), of the p-Si-based photocathodes, respectively, and e, k, and T are the electron charge (1.602 × 10−19 C), Boltzmann constant (1.381 × 10−23 J K−1), and temperature (298 K), respectively.62
The negative M–S slopes of both photocathodes indicate p-type conductivity with holes as the major charge carriers.63 The Efb of the p-Si and p-Si/Ni–Gr core–shell photocathodes are −0.91 and −1.16 V vs. RHE, respectively. The negatively-shifted Efb value of the p-Si/Ni–Gr core–shell photocathode shows an increase in the energy gap that increases the injection driving force of the electrons and the electron injection efficiency. The ND values calculated using the Efb values from the M–S slopes were −2.75 × 1014 and −1.16 × 1015 for the p-Si and p-Si/Ni–Gr core–shell photocathodes, respectively, with the slight increase in the latter being attributed to changes in the electrochemical properties at the semiconductor/liquid interface. All of these parameter values demonstrate that the PEC water-splitting performance of the p-Si/Ni–Gr core–shell photocathode is excellent, the surface charge transfer rate is efficient, and the photogenerated electron–hole recombination is repressed.
Based on the above analysis, the schematic showing the charge transfer mechanism in p-Si/Ni–Gr core–shell photocathode under visible light irradiation is illustrated in Fig. 5. When the p-Si photocathode is illuminated, it produces photogenerated electrons and holes in the conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB) of the Si. The generated electrons migrate toward the electrolyte for water reduction to generate hydrogen gas and the holes migrate towards the anode, where they participate in the water oxidation reaction by accepting electrons to form oxygen gas. However, electrons generated after the introduction of the Ni–Gr core–shell over Si are captured in the Gr shell and transferred to the electrolyte due to the high conductivity and smaller work function of Gr. Then some electrons transferred to the Gr surface directly react with adsorbed water to yield hydrogen, while those captured in Gr would further migrate to the Ni core, where they ultimately become trapped. Due to these mechanisms, the Ni–Gr core–shell accelerates carrier separation and transport and suppresses electron–hole recombination. Hence, the synergistic effect between the Ni (Core) and Gr (Shell) dramatically improves the PEC performance of the Si photocathode.

Good durability is a very important property for Si-based photocathodes because of unavoidable photocorrosion caused by acidic electrolytes. To assess the stability of photocathodes in an acidic electrolyte, we attained chronoamperometry measurements at a constant potential of −1.2 V vs. RHE under AM 1.5G light, shown in Fig. 6(a). An applied bias of −1.2 V vs. RHE resulted in photocurrent densities of −48 and −32 mA cm−2 for the p-Si/Ni–Gr core–shell and p-Si photocathodes, respectively, which are in good agreement with the LSV curves in Fig. 4(b). During the examination, the p-Si photocurrent density decreased by 10% after 50 h whereas that of the p-Si/Ni–Gr core–shell photocathode was unchanged. Fig. 6(b) and (c) confirms the before and after long-term stability test, showing SEM images where the corroded surface of samples and its variation can be observed. As seen clearly in Fig. 6(b), there are three distinguished zones: (i) the clear p-Si surface, (ii) the corroded p-Si surface (marked by gray dash line) and (iii) the products from electrolytes (marked by red arrow). In the case of p-Si, it can be seen that the surface is corroding progressively. Fig. 6(c) show no obvious changes in the SEM images of the p-Si/Ni–Gr core–shell surface before and after the examination, in contrast to that of p-Si. Therefore, the Ni–Gr core–shell not only provides the catalytic active sites but also provides the protective barrier to the Si surface against photo-corrosion.

4. Conclusions
We successfully developed an efficient Ni–Gr core–shell catalyst composed of an Ni particle as the core and a high-quality Gr monolayer as the shell. The structure of the Ni–Gr core–shell via SEM and TEM analyses showed the formation of a very thin layer of Gr on the edge of the Ni powder. Moreover, the high crystallinity of the Gr layer was confirmed via XRD, Raman, and XPS analyses. The p-Si/Ni–Gr core–shell photocathode showed higher photocatalytic activity than that of bare p-Si due to Gr promoting electron transfer from the Si layer to the Ni–Gr core–shell and separating electron–hole pairs. The p-Si/Ni–Gr core–shell photocathode also showed marvelous stability for PEC over 50 hours. The outstanding water-splitting performance of the p-Si/Ni–Gr core–shell in this study opens the door for a new generation of PEC photocatalysts by exploiting the synergistic effects of catalytic materials used in PEC cells.
