    , Accepted 4th September 2015First published on 7th September 2015AbstractAll-polymer solar cells (PSCs), using naphthalene diimide (NDI)- or perylene diimide (PDI)-based polymers as the electron acceptor, have been intensively investigated in recent years. Nevertheless, the lack of comprehensive comparison studies of NDI- and PDI-based polymers has limited the further development of novel acceptor polymers. Here, we conduct a comparative study of two solution-processable cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene (CPDT)-based n-type copolymers, PCPDT-NDI and PCPDT-PDI, focusing on their optical, electrochemical and photovoltaic properties. Although PCPDT-NDI has better near-infrared (850–1100 nm) light absorption and crystalline properties, the photovoltaic performance is disappointing mainly because of the poor miscibility with the PTB7 donor polymer and the inferior film quality. On the contrary, PCPDT-PDI exhibits a much better photovoltaic performance with a power conversion efficiency of 2.13% when using 1-chloronaphthalene (CN) as an additive to obtain a good film morphology and to improve the electron mobility. The comprehensive comparison of PDI and NDI-based polymers will help understand the structure–property–performance relationship and will contribute to further development of novel rylene diimide-containing n-type polymers.
Introduction
All-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs) composed of both polymer donors and polymer acceptors have attracted a great deal of attention due to their potential advantages over conventional fullerene-based solar cells: (1) complementary absorption spectra of both polymers for higher short-circuit current (JSC); (2) readily tunable molecular orbital levels for effective charge transfer and higher open circuit voltage (VOC); and (3) the flexibility in controlling the solution viscosity and the enhanced mechanical/thermal properties for roll-to-roll large area fabrication.1–4 Although the VOC of all-PSCs could be easily modulated and over 1.0 V has been realized, the overall performance still lags far behind polymer/fullerene bulk heterojunction systems mainly because of the low JSC and fill factor.5,6 The limited efficiency mainly comes from the scarcity of excellent acceptor polymers, and thus, the development of solution-processable n-type polymer semiconductors with suitable energy levels, a wide absorption band, and high electron affinity and mobility remains necessary.7–11
At present, two kinds of rylene diimides, perylene diimide (PDI) and naphthalene diimide (NDI), are the most effective building blocks to construct n-type polymer acceptors owing to their excellent chemical and thermal stability, high electron affinities, and remarkable electron-transporting properties. The development of PDI-based polymers for all-PSC application occurred earlier than NDI-based polymers. In 2007, Zhan et al. reported the first PDI-based polymer, PDI-dithienothiophene copolymer, which exhibits a broad absorption spectrum, a high electron mobility of 0.013 cm2 V−1 s−1 and a PCE of over 1% using a polythiophene derivative as the donor.12 After the modulation of the chemical structures of the corresponding donor and acceptor polymers, Zhan et al. improved the PCE to 1.48%.7,13 In 2011, we reported all-PSCs based on six kinds of PDI-based polymers, and the best PCE of 2.23% was achieved by optimizing the solvent.14 In 2014, Zhan et al. utilized binary additives, DIO and PDI-2DTT, and successfully boosted the PCE of all-PSCs based on the PBDTTT-C-T:PPDIDTT combination up to 3.45% due to a suitable phase separation and balanced charge transport.15 In 2013, Zhao et al. fabricated inverted all-PSCs with a PCE of 2.17% by employing the first 1,7-regioregular PDI-dithiophene copolymer as the acceptor and P3HT as the donor.16 In 2014, they enhanced all-PSCs with PCE beyond 4.4%, the highest value for PDI-based polymers, by the side-chain engineering of low band gap donor polymers.17
On the other hand, the development of a solution-processable NDI-based polymer started in 2009, when Facchetti et al. reported an excellent electron-accepting polymer P(NDI2OD-T2) with electron mobility up to 0.85 cm2 V−1 s−1.18 However, in the early stage, P(NDI2OD-T2) exhibited a disappointing photovoltaic performance. Using the classic poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) as the donor, a PCE of only 0.2% was achieved by Sirringhaus et al. and Frechet et al.9,19 In the same year, Loi et al. obtained a high fill factor and an improved PCE of 0.62% for the P3HT:P(NDI2OD-T2) combination by optimizing the photoactive layer morphology.20 By comparing P3HT:F8TBT with P3HT:P(NDI2OD-T2) device performance, it was found that the large domains driven by crystallization in P3HT:P(NDI2OD-T2) blends are the dominating factors that hamper the device performance.21 In 2012, the PCE of all-PSCs comprising P3HT and P(NDI2OD-T2) was increased up to 1.4% by using a suitable solvent to suppress the preaggregation of naphthalene copolymers.22 After that, many non-P3HT donor polymers were combined with P(NDI2OD-T2) and the photovoltaic performance was greatly improved to 4.1% (PTQ1),23 4.35% (PTP8),24 4.5% (PTB7-Th),25 4.1% (BSF4),6 5.03% (PPDT2FBT),26 5% (NT),27 and 5.73% (PBDTTT-EF-T),28 respectively. Meanwhile, many novel NDI-based polymers were also designed and synthesized. In 2012, we synthesized an NDI-fluorene copolymer, and a PCE of 1.6% was achieved by using DIO as the additive,29 and the PCE could be improved to 3.6% by developing an NDI-carbazole copolymer.30 In 2013, Jenekhe et al. synthesized the NDI-selenophene copolymer acceptor PNDIS-HD, and a PCE of 3.3% was achieved by using the PSEHTT donor,31 which could be further improved to 4.8% by solution processing from a co-solvent.32 In 2014, Kim et al. demonstrated an NDI-thiophene copolymer PNDIT-HD as an effective acceptor with 6% PCE benefiting from the face-on crystalline orientation rather than the analogous PNDIT-OD and PNDIT-DT with different alkyl side chains.33 Recently, a fluorinated n-type polymer P(NDIDT-FT2) was utilized as an efficient electron acceptor in the PBDTT-TT-F:P(NDIDT-FT2) system, resulting in a very high PCE of 6.7% without any solvent additive.34 Very recently, a new PCE record of 7.7% was achieved by employing a suitable acceptor polymer of PNDIS-HD and a donor polymer of PBDTT-FTTE.35
As mentioned above, it could be found that NDI-based all-PSCs exhibited a PCE as high as 7.7%, which is superior to that of PDI-based all-PSCs. Of these reported copolymers, NDI-based copolymers, in general, exhibit better crystallinity and higher electron mobility than PDI-based polymers. However, the detailed comparison of two kinds of polymers in one report is limited,36 and it is also vital to investigate the different properties of PDI and NDI-based polymers and to understand the structure–property–performance relationship.37,38 Here, we choose a planar building block cyclopenta[1,2-b:5,4-b′]dithiophene (CPDT) to copolymerize with NDI and PDI moieties, respectively, and systematically investigate the different properties and dominating factors for photovoltaic performance by choosing the excellent p-type polymer PTB7 as the donor.39–43 The synthetic routes and chemical structures of these two n-type semiconducting polymers, namely PCPDT-NDI and PCPDT-PDI, are shown in Scheme 1.

Experimental
Synthesis of polymers
All chemicals were purchased from Alfa, Aldrich, TCI or Wako and were used without any treatment and further purification. The copolymers PCPDT-NDI and PCPDT-PDI were synthesized according to the following procedures.

Poly{4,4-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl-alt-N,N′-dihexyl-1,4,5,8-naphthalene diimide-2,6-diyl} (PCPDT-NDI). 
Monomer 1 (473 mg, 0.65 mmol), monomer 2 (385 mg, 0.65 mmol) and dry toluene (10 mL) were added to a 50 mL double-neck round bottom flask. The reaction container was purged with N2 for 30 min to remove O2. Pd(PPh3)4 (3%, 23 mg) was added, and heated up to 110 °C. The solution was stirred at 110 °C for 48 h. The dark blue sticky solution was cooled down to room temperature and poured into methanol and the precipitate was filtered and washed with methanol and hexane in a Soxhlet extractor to remove the oligomers and catalyst residue. Finally, the polymer was extracted with chloroform. The solution was condensed by evaporation and precipitated into methanol, and the polymer was collected as a dark blue solid. Yield: 270 mg (52%). 1H NMR (CDCl3, 400 MHz): 1H NMR (CDCl3, 400 MHz): δ(ppm) 8.8 (br, 2H), 7.0 (br, 2H), 4.0 (br, 4H), 2.0–0.7 (br, 56H). Mn = 12.4 kg mol−1; polydispersity = 1.6.


Poly{4,4-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl-alt-N,N′-di(2-ethylhexyl)-3,4,9,10-perylene diimide-1,7-diyl} (PCPDT-PDI). 
A procedure similar to the synthesis of PCPDT-NDI was adopted by using monomer 1 (728 mg, 1.0 mmol), monomer 3 (772.6 mg, 1.0 mmol), dry toluene (20 mL) and Pd(PPh3)4 (3%, 35 mg). The polymer was collected as a dark blue solid. Yield: 610 mg (60%). 1H NMR (CDCl3, 400 MHz): δ(ppm) 8.7–8.0 (m, 6H), 7.1 (br, 2H), 4.1 (br, 4H), 1.9–0.6 (br, 64H). Mn = 11.8 kg mol−1; polydispersity = 1.9.

Characterization

1H NMR (400 MHz) spectra were recorded using a JEOL Alpha FT-NMR spectrometer equipped with an Oxford superconducting magnet system. The molecular weights of polymers were estimated by high temperature gel permeation chromatography at 160 °C using 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene as the solvent and polystyrene as a standard. Absorption spectra were recorded using a JASCO V-660 spectrometer. The concentration of the polymers in CHCl3 solutions was 5 × 10−3 g L−1 and the films were spin-coated from CHCl3 solutions (5 g L−1). Cyclic voltammograms (CVs) were recorded on an HSV-100 (Hokuto Denkou) potentiostat. A Pt plate coated with a thin polymer film was used as the working electrode. A Pt wire and an Ag/Ag+ (0.01 M of AgNO3 in acetonitrile) electrode were used as the counter and reference electrodes (calibrated against Fc/Fc+), respectively. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was conducted in tapping mode with a 5400 scanning probe microscope (Agilent Technologies). XRD patterns were recorded on a Rigaku SmartLab X-ray diffractometer. The films were prepared by spin-coating chlorobenzene solutions of the polymers (10 g L−1) on Si substrates and thermally annealed at 80 °C for 30 min.
Fabrication and characterization of polymer solar cells
PSCs were fabricated with the conventional sandwich structure through several steps. ITO-coated glass substrates were cleaned by ultrasonication sequentially in detergent, water, acetone and 2-propanol. After drying the substrate, PEDOT:PSS (Baytron P) was spin-coated (4000 rpm, 30 s) on ITO. The film was dried at 150 °C under a N2 atmosphere for 5 min. After cooling the substrate, a blend solution of PTB7 and PCPDT-NDI (or PCPDT-PDI) with the total concentration of 20 g L−1 was spin-coated. The substrate was annealed at 80 °C for 30 min inside a nitrogen-filled glove box to dry the solvent completely, after which a Ca/Al (20 nm/60 nm) electrode was evaporated onto the substrate under high vacuum (<10−4 Pa) in an evaporation chamber (ALS Technology, H-2807 vacuum evaporation system with E-100 load lock). Photovoltaic cells without protective encapsulation were subsequently tested in air under simulated AM1.5 solar irradiation (100 mW cm−2, Peccell Technologies, PCE-L11). The light intensity was adjusted by using a standard silicon solar cell with an optical filter (Bunkou Keiki, BS520). The current–voltage characteristics of the photovoltaic cells were recorded using a Keithley 2400 I–V measurement system. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the devices was measured on a Hypermonolight System (Bunkou Keiki, SM-250F). The configuration of the shadow mask afforded eight independent devices on each substrate, with an active layer of ∼0.21 cm2 (3 mm × ∼7 mm) for each device. The effective area of the PSCs was defined using a metal photomask (2 mm × 3 mm) during irradiation with simulated solar light.
Hole and electron mobility measurement by the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method
Hole- and electron-only devices were fabricated by using the device structures of glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS(30 nm)/active layer/MoO3(5 nm)/Au(60 nm) and glass/Al(60 nm)/active layer/Al(60 nm), respectively. The active layers were spin-coated from chloroform solution with the total concentration of 15 mg mL−1. Both hole and electron mobilities were calculated with the Mott–Gurney equation in the SCLC region (slope = 2):  where ε0 is the permittivity of the vacuum, εr is the dielectric constant of the polymer (assumed to be 3), and L is the thickness of the polymer layer.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
Monomer 2 is a pure 2,6-dibromo compound but monomer 3 is a mixture of 1,7 and 1,6 regio-isomers with the ratio of about 85:15. Due to the difficulty in obtaining a pristine 1,7 regio-isomer, in this paper, we did not investigate the effect of 1,6-regio isomers and the mixture 3 is simplified as a 1,7-isomer.44 The monomers 4,4-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-2,6-bis(trimethylstannyl)-cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene (monomer 1), monomer 2 and monomer 3 were synthesized according to the known procedures in the literature.14,29,30 The new n-type copolymers PCPDT-NDI and PCPDT-PDI were synthesized by Stille coupling copolymerization of monomer 1 with monomer 2 and monomer 3, respectively. The number averaged molecular weights (Mn) of PCPDT-NDI and PCPDT-PDI were 12.4 and 11.8 kg mol−1 with a polydispersity index (PDI) of 1.6 and 1.9, respectively, which were measured by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) at 160 °C using 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene as a solvent. The polymers have good solubility in common organic solvents such as CF, chlorobenzene (CB) and dichlorobenzene (DCB).
Electrochemical properties
The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels of PCPDT-NDI and PCPDT-PDI were measured by cyclic voltammetry (CV), and the voltammograms are shown in Fig. 1, together with the energy levels and structure of PTB7. The electrochemical band-gaps of PCPDT-NDI and PCPDT-PDI are 1.63 eV and 1.88 eV, respectively, which will contribute to efficient absorption of solar spectra. The lower band gap of PCPDT-NDI than that of PCPDT-PDI might come from more delocalized π-conjugation along the polymer backbone. PTB7 has energy levels LUMO (−3.31 eV) and HOMO (−5.15 eV),45–47 and was utilized as the donor polymer for solar cell application. The LUMO offsets of PTB7:PCPDT-NDI and PTB7:PCPDT-PDI are estimated to be 0.57 eV and 0.53 eV, respectively, which would provide a large enough driving force for efficient charge separation without too much energy loss.48 Additionally, the energy offsets of LUMO(acceptor)–HOMO(donor) were calculated to be 1.27 eV and 1.31 eV, which could reduce the charge transfer states geminate recombination at the donor/acceptor interface.

Optical properties
UV-vis absorption was performed to detect the absorption spectra of the donor and acceptor matching with the solar spectrum in the visible and near-IR regions. Fig. 2 displays the absorption spectra of PCPDT-NDI and PCPDT-PDI in CHCl3 solution and in the film on quartz plates, together with the film absorption of the PTB7 donor polymer. The polymer PCPDT-NDI film shows typical NDI-based polymer absorption with two distinctive bands at 300–450 nm and 600–1000 nm, which are assigned to n–π* and π–π* transitions and the intramolecular charge transfer band, respectively.32,49 The normalized absorption spectrum of the PCPDT-PDI film shows continuous absorption in the region of 300–900 nm with absorption maxima at 360 nm, 500 nm and 700 nm, which is similar to that of the analogous PDTP-PDI polymer.14 The PCPDT-NDI film shows a broader absorption region extending up to 1000 nm than PCPDT-PDI with the absorption edge at 850 nm, which implies larger absorption of photons. Compared with the absorption spectrum in solution, the peaks of PCPDT-NDI in film are redshifted by 16 nm at short wavelength region and 65 nm at long wavelength region respectively, due to the intermolecular interactions in the solid state, while PCPDT-PDI has similar spectra, which indicates that PCPDT-NDI has smaller steric hindrance than PCPDT-PDI to ensure the formation of an ordered structure during the spin-coating process. Moreover, the absorption of PTB7 is in the region of 400–750 nm, which can complement the absorption of PCPDT-NDI and PCPDT-PDI to furthest utilize sunlight with the maximum photon flux at 600–800 nm.

X-ray diffraction analysis
X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were carried out to understand the crystalline structures and molecular orientations of PCPDT-NDI and PCPDT-PDI in the solid state. The films were spin-coated from a CB solution on Si/SiO2 substrates and then thermally annealed at 100 °C for 10 min. As shown in Fig. 3, PCPDT-NDI shows one strong diffraction peak at 2θ = 5.4° in the out-of-plane profile, from which the interlayer stacking distance is calculated to be 1.64 nm as shown in Fig. 3b. However, there is no clear peak in that of the PCPDT-PDI film, indicating that PCPDT-PDI exhibits amorphous structures in the film, which might result from the relatively larger PDI moiety disturbing the planarity of the backbones. For the in-plane XRD curves, both PCPDT-NDI and PCPDT-PDI have no clear peak, although one broad and weak peak at 2θ = 20° corresponding to the π–π stacking is obtained in PCPDT-PDI diffraction curves. Therefore, we can conclude that PCPDT-NDI has a more ordered structure in the film.

Photovoltaic properties
Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) all-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs) based on PTB7:PCPDT-NDI and PTB7:PCPDT-PDI combinations were fabricated with a conventional sandwich structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Ca/Al to investigate their photovoltaic properties. The performance of PSCs was optimized by changing the weight ratio of the donor and the acceptor as well as the thickness of the blend film. The weight ratio of 1:1 and the thicknesses of 80–90 nm for both PTB7:PCPDT-NDI and PTB7:PCPDT-PDI systems gave the best photovoltaic performance. The optimal current density–voltage (J–V) curves under simulated solar light illumination (AM1.5, 100 mW cm−2) are given in Fig. 4 and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1, where different solvents (CB, DCB, CF) without and with the additive CN were used to spin-coat the active layers.

The PTB7:PCPDT-NDI devices fabricated by CB and DCB solvents yielded a relatively low PCE of 0.87%. When CF was used as the solvent, the best PCE reached up to 1.12% with VOC = 0.74 V, JSC = 3.85 mA cm−2 and FF = 0.39. Upon addition of 1.0 vol% solvent additive CN to the CF solvent, the PCE largely decreased to 0.76% with decreasing value of JSC = 2.57 mA cm−2. In the case of the PTB7:PCPDT-PDI device, the CF solvent exhibited a higher PCE of 1.38%, slightly higher than the CB solvent. However, the addition of 1.0 vol% CN to CF could improve the PCE up to 2.13% from 1.38%, which is different from PTB7:PCPDT-NDI. The VOC slightly decreased from 0.74 V to 0.70 V, JSC largely increased from 4.74 mA cm−2 to 7.25 mA cm−2, and FF slightly increased from 0.39 to 0.42. This result indicated that the additive CN mainly affects the JSC of the devices. After further increasing the concentration of the additive CN to 3 vol%, the PCE decreased to 1.46% with a lower JSC of 4.85 mA cm−2. Therefore, 1 vol% of the additive CN in the solvent is the optimal condition for high photovoltaic performance in PTB7:PCPDT-PDI devices. Moreover, the efficiencies were significantly higher than for the previously reported PSBTBT:PCPDT-PDI device with an inferior PCE of 0.43%, indicating that PTB7 was an effective electron donor to combine with PDI-based copolymers.50
The experimentally observed VOC values of PCPDT-PDI are similar to those of PCPDT-NDI, which is consistent with the energy differences between HOMO(D) and LUMO(A).51 The JSC of the PCPDT-PDI device is much higher than that of PCPDT-NDI, although PCPDT-NDI has a broader absorption than PCPDT-PDI, which might come from the more ideal morphology in the PTB7:PCPDT-PDI system. It has been reported that the additive could affect the aggregation of the active layer.52 Therefore, we used the atomic force microscopy (AFM) technique to investigate the morphology of the blend films. The height images of PTB7:PCPDT-NDI and PTB7:PCPDT-PDI films are shown in Fig. 5. For the films of PTB7:PCPDT-NDI, CB and DCB films show a large aggregation domain, while the CF film shows better phase separation. Upon addition of 1.0 vol% CN to CF, the film shows large aggregation again. The uniform film is benificial for forming the charge transfer state at the donor/acceptor interface, while the aggregation phase is in favor of free charge carrier transport in the continuous pathway.

For PTB7:PCPDT-PDI films, CF resulted in a much more smooth film surface than CB. Upon addition of 1.0 vol% CN to CF, better phase separation could be obtained with the crystallization phase. However, 3.0 vol% CN induced large aggregated grains. Comparing the films spin-coated from CF, PTB7:PCPDT-NDI exhibited large aggregation grains, while PTB7:PCPDT-PDI was uniform and smooth, which could be ascribed to the strong aggregation ability and ordered structure of PCPDT-NDI. Moreover, the effect of the additive CN on the aggregation of the donor polymer PTB7 cannot be neglected, which will be further proved below. Consequently, the additive CN has a large effect on the morphology of blend films containing different polymers, which finally results in difference in photovoltaic efficiency. Furthermore, after choosing other promising p-type polymers with good miscibility with PCPDT-NDI, the photovoltaic performance could be improved.53–55
Charge mobility
As discussed above, the PTB7:PCPDT-PDI device fabricated with the mixture solvent CF:CN (99:1, v/v) shows the best PCE with relatively higher JSC and FF. Under the ideal conditions, JSC is determined by the charge carrier density and charge carrier mobility, therefore the hole and electron mobilities are important parameters for the total performance.56 To investigate the effect of the additive CN on charge-carrier transport, the hole (μh) and electron mobilities (μe) in the PTB7:PCPDT-PDI blends spin-coating from CF and CF:CN were measured by the space charge limited current (SCLC) method with the Mott–Gurney equation. The typical J–V curves of the hole-only and electron-only devices are shown in Fig. 6, which exhibit obvious Ohmic (slope = 1) and SCLC regions (slope = 2). The hole mobility of the films spin-coated from CF and CF:CN were estimated to be 1.0×10−4 and 1.3×10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The small changed hole mobility suggests that the additive CN induces little effect on the aggregation of PTB7 compared to the hole mobility of pure PTB7 reported as 2.5×10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1.45 On the contrary, by adding 1.0 vol% of CN in CF, the electron mobility of the blend film improved from 2.8 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1 to 9.8 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1, which might be caused by the aggregation of PCPDT-PDI and/or the purification of the n-type polymer domains. However, the μe/μh of 0.075 was still quite low, and this unbalanced charge mobility should be the reason for the low fill factor and the consequent inferior photovoltaic performance, which implies that there is still a large development space for the device with a higher PCE.20

External quantum efficiency

Fig. 7 exhibits the external quantum efficiency (EQE) plots of polymer solar cells based on PTB7:PCPDT-NDI and PTB7:PCPDT-PDI films spin-coated from CF and CF:CN (99:1, v/v). The PTB7:PCPDT-NDI device fabricated from CF shows an EQE peak value of 17%, which is slightly larger than that of the device spin-coated from the mixture solvent CF:CN. The decreasing EQE upon addition of CN might result from the lower efficiency exciton diffusion due to the large aggregation domain. In contrast, the PTB7:PCPDT-PDI device spin-coated from CF:CN (99:1 v/v) has a higher EQE peak value of 34% than that of 23% obtained from the device fabricated from the CF solvent. The increasing EQE in the PTB7:PCPDT-PDI device upon addition of CN is consistent with good phase separation and higher electron mobility, indicating that the additive CN not only improve the efficiency of exciton diffusion, but also enhances the charge carrier transport. Moreover, PTB7:PCPDT-PDI devices show higher EQE than that of PTB7:PCPDT-NDI in the wavelength region of 300–750 nm; however, the EQE of PTB7:PCPDT-NDI devices is higher than that of PTB7:PCPDT-PDI in the 750–950 nm region. From the UV-vis absorption, the larger EQE should mainly be attributed to the absorption of PCPDT-NDI.

Conclusions
In summary, two n-type copolymers PCPDT-NDI and PCPDT-PDI were synthesized by coupling the planar CPDT unit with NDI and PDI moieties, respectively. Compared with PCPDT-PDI, PCPDT-NDI showed a broader absorption spectrum and better crystallinity. The best photovoltaic performance for the PTB7:PCPDT-NDI device is obtained when using CF as the solvent, and the addition of CN reduced the PCE due to the larger domain sizes. In contrast, the PTB7:PCPDT-PDI device incorporating 1.0 vol% CN as an additive exhibited a good film morphology and an improved PCE of 2.13% with VOC = 0.70 V, JSC = 7.25 mA cm−2 and FF = 0.42. The occurrence of significantly increased JSC might be due to the improved exciton dissociation into free charge carrier and the enhanced electron mobility, proved by AFM and electron-only device measurements. The comparison of NDI and PDI-based n-type polymers could provide an insight into the optimum polymer for high performance all-polymer solar cells.
