    , Accepted 13th March 2019First published on 13th March 2019AbstractWhile nickel phosphide is a highly attractive catalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction, its preparation requires either high temperature or the use of highly toxic PH3 directly or indirectly. Herein, we demonstrate that H2 plasma activated red phosphorus enables the synthesis of self-supported Ni2P nanosheet (Ni2P/NF) arrays on commercial nickel foam from a NiO/NF precursor at only 250 °C. Highly reactive atomic H in the plasma induces dissociation of the P4 molecules, yielding an acid stable electrode with excellent hydrogen evolution activity and good mechanical strength.
Water electrolysis using solar or wind electrical energy is a well-established method for sustainable hydrogen production.1,2 However, the widespread application of water electrolysis is still limited by its relatively high cost. A major avenue to achieve low cost water electrolysis is to replace the noble metal electrocatalysts with low cost catalysts with comparable performance.3 In recent years, exploring efficient noble-metal-free electrocatalysts for both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) has stimulated intense research interest.4–7
Recently, transition metal phosphides have appeared as promising HER catalysts,8–10 especially because of their stability in acidic electrolytes being used in proton exchange membrane electrolyzers.11,12 However, preparation of phosphides is significantly more sophisticated compared to other non-noble metal compounds.13,14 Thermal phosphorization using element P requires high temperature and thus is unfavorable for controlled preparation of nanostructures.15–17 Using other reactive P precursors is more common. For instance, phosphorization can be achieved at ∼ 200 °C using PH3.18 NaH2PO2 can be used as an alternative PH3 source, which yields PH3 during thermal decomposition at ∼300 °C.19,20 But this also cannot prevent the toxic phosphines from being emitted during the reaction. Common phosphorus sources in liquid phase reactions, P(SiMe3)321,22 and trioctylphosphine,23–25 are both expensive organic phases and require solvents with high boiling points. Phosphorization methods under mild conditions using low cost, environmentally benign precursors are highly desirable.
Red phosphorous has appreciable vapor pressure at moderate temperature (∼250 °C) while the phosphorization temperature is much higher (above 500 °C), indicating that a high temperature is required to activate the relatively inert P4 molecules rather than to vaporize red phosphorous. Thus, low temperature phosphorization can be achieved using red phosphorous if the reactivity of the phosphorous vapor can be enhanced.
To address this challenge, we use H2 plasma to activate the phosphorous vapor. Low temperature plasma such as glow discharge can generate highly reactive species at mild temperature, which has shown unique effects on the preparation and modification of electrocatalysts.26–32 Plasma has also been used for phosphide preparation using PH3 as the phosphorus precursor.33 In this work, we demonstrate that with plasma activation, efficient non-thermal phosphorization can be achieved using H2 and red phosphorous, two low-toxicity precursors. NiO nanosheets grown on Ni foam can be directly converted into Ni2P with the same morphology at only 250 °C, generating a monolithic electrode with good mechanical strength and excellent HER activity and stability in acid.
Commercial Ni foam is used as the substrate for the electrode. To enhance the areal density of the catalytic sites, Ni(OH)2 nanosheets are first grown onto the Ni foam (denoted as Ni(OH)2/NF) using a hydrothermal method as described in the literature.34 Then the Ni(OH)2/NF sample is heated in air to convert Ni(OH)2 into NiO, which is essential to prevent the nanosheets from collapsing during phosphoriztion (see Fig. S1 and S2 (ESI†) for comparison). Phosphorization is carried out in a quartz tube furnace equipped with an induction coil in the upstream region for plasma generation (Fig. 1a). The glow turns light yellow when mixed with the phosphorus vapor, which can extend to the NiO/NF sample region for phosphorization. After phosphorization for 1 h, the nickel foam homogeneously covered with NiO turns from light yellow to black (Fig. 1b). As shown in Fig. 1c, the electrode can be bent into a curved shape. The mechanical robustness is highly desirable for electrocatalysis application.
 Fig. 1  (a) Schematic illustration of the plasma phosphorization setup. Red phosphorous is heated at 250 °C to generate phosphorous vapour, which is actived by low pressure Ar–H2 plasma. The light yellow glow of Ar–H2–P plasma in the quartz tube is shown by the photograph. (b) NiO nanosheets grown on Ni foam (NiO/NF) are converted into Ni2P nanosheets grown on Ni foam (Ni2P/NF), as indicated by the colour change in the photographs. (c) The Ni2P/NF sample retains the mechanical strength of the Ni foam, which can be bent. 
As shown by the SEM images (Fig. 2b and c), the NiO nanosheets exhibit a lateral dimension of 10 μm with a thickness less than 10 nm, which are gathered into rose-like morphologies. The XRD pattern suggests (Fig. 2a) that the NiO phase (JCPDS No. 89-7130) is converted to Ni2P (JCPDS No. 74-1385). SEM images (Fig. 2d and e) suggest that the nanosheet morphology is retained after phosphorization. SEM-EDX mapping demonstrates that the P element is uniformly distributed over the surface (Fig. S3c, ESI†). TEM images in Fig. 2h–j suggest that the nanosheets are composed of Ni2P nanocrystals ∼10 nm in diameter. Lattice images corresponding to the (010), (021) and (111) planes of Ni2P can be clearly resolved.

The Ni2P nanosheets are scratched from the Ni foam and analysed by XPS (Fig. 2f and g). The peaks at 853.2 eV in the Ni 2p3/2 spectrum and 129.6 eV in the P 2p3/2 spectrum are slightly shifted compared to elemental Ni (852.8 eV) and P (130.0 eV),35–38 which are in agreement with the slightly positive and negative charge on Ni and P in Ni2P, respectively. Surface oxidation is also observed, as shown by the peaks corresponding to Ni2+ (856.5 eV) and phosphorus oxide (POx, 133.8 eV). Similar results are also observed in other metal phosphide nanostructures.33
The Ni2P/NiF sample is tested for its catalytic HER performance in acidic electrolyte. As shown in Fig. 3a and b, the Ni2P/NiF sample shows a low overpotential of only 65 mV at 10 mA cm−2. A low Tafel slope of 63 mV dec−1 suggests a Volmer–Heyrovsky mechanism for the HER,39i.e. the rate is limited by both the discharge step and the desorption step. Although Ni is unstable in acid, the Ni2P/NF electrode can be used for the HER in acid as the surface is fully phosphorized. As shown in Fig. 3c, the potential is very stable during continuous electrolysis for 14 h with different current densities from 20 to 140 mA cm−2. The evolved H2 volume is in excellent agreement with that calculated using Faraday's law, indicating nearly 100% Faraday efficiency (Fig. 3d). For comparison, the state of the art phosphide based HER catalysts in acid reported in the literature can be found in Table S1 (ESI†).

The curves of a commercial Pt/C catalyst with 20 wt% Pt and the phosphorized Ni foam (P-NF) are shown for comparison. (c) Potential profiles during galvanostatic measurements at different current densities as indicated by numbers (in mA cm−2). (d) Measured and theoretical volume of the generated H2 in galvanostatic electrolysis at 20 mA cm−2. 
The stability can be further confirmed by the structural analysis after the electrolysis. As shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†), the nickel phosphide phases and the nanosheet morphology are retained, with only slight roughening of the edge of the nanosheets. Although there is no crystalline oxide phase, XPS analysis suggests that the surface of the Ni2P/NF sample is almost completely oxidized after electrolysis (Fig. S4c and d, ESI†). This is commonly observed in metal phosphide nanostructures and the oxide layer will automatically dissolve during the HER process in acid.40
The Ni2P/NF electrode is further evaluated as a cathode in a solar cell driven electrolyzer to produce H2 using solar energy. H2SO4 (0.5 M) is used as an electrolyte. RuO2 nanoparticles supported on carbon cloth are used as the OER electrode. The electrolyzer delivers a current density of 10 mA cm−2 at a cell voltage of only 1.54 V, which is stable during continuous operation for 14 h (Fig. 4c). Driven by a commercial polycrystalline solar cell at a sun radiation of 80 mW cm−2, the working voltage and current of the cell are 2.04 V and 111.2 mA, respectively (Fig. 4a). A detailed analysis of the energy utilization in the electrolyzer is shown in Fig. 4b. An overall electrolysis energy efficiency of 61% is achieved at a high current of 100 mA. The Ni2P/NF electrode causes a low energy efficiency loss of only 7%, showing its promising application as a low cost alternative for Pt based HER electrodes.

To demonstrate the effects of the nanosheet morphology on the HER performance, we apply the same phosphorization procedure on bare Ni foam without the NiO nanosheets. The obtained sample is designated as P/NF. Although crystalline phosphide phases are absent in the XRD pattern (Fig. S5a, ESI†), the Ni 2p and P 2p XPS spectra are very similar to those of the Ni2P/NF sample (Fig. S5e and f, ESI†). However, the phosphorized Ni foam is significantly less active for the HER compared to the Ni2P/NF sample, as indicated by the much higher overpotential (Fig. 3a) and the Tafel slope (Fig. 3b). The nanosheet morphology causing a much higher electrochemical active surface area is much higher than that of the P/NF sample (Fig. S6, ESI†). The charge transfer impedance by fitting the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy data is also much lower (Fig. S7, ESI†). Thus, it is critical to carry out the phosphorization at mild temperature to retain the nanosheet structure and maintain the mechanical strength of the Ni foam.
Plasma is essential to achieve efficient phosphorization under such mild conditions. For comparison, simply heating red phosphorous in H2 flow at 250 °C leads to no phosphorization (Fig. S8, ESI†). To understand the role of plasma, optical emission spectroscopy (OES) is used to study the reactive species in the plasma (Fig. 5a). When comparing the OES spectra of Ar–H2 and Ar–H2–P plasma as shown in Fig. 5a, emission lines corresponding to the PH radical (341 nm)41,42 can be identified in the Ar–H2–P plasma, while the atomic H lines (656 nm and 484 nm)43 are weakened compared to that in the Ar–H2 plasma. The PH radical enables efficient non-thermal phosphorization. As shown in Fig. S8 (ESI†), if the phosphorous vapour is only activated by Ar plasma, there is no formation of Ni2P, indicating that the H species is necessary for the conversion of NiO to Ni2P. This is easy to understand as the H species will assist the leaving of O as H2O.

As a result, with H2 plasma activated phosphorous vapor, the morphology retained non-thermal phophorization can be achieved similar to that using PH3 or NaH2PO2, even at lower temperature (250 °C compared to 300–350 °C in literature). The temperature used here is mainly to generate sufficient phosphorous vapour instead of an energy source to activate the phosphorous source. Here much less toxic red phosphorous is used as the precursor, which is highly desirable for phosphide preparation. Moreover, the high reactivity of plasma generated PH radicals allows the use of only a low amount of red phosphorous (<100 mg) for phosphorization. The amount of unutilized phosphorous vapor is very limited and is condensed very close to the solid red P source due to the low reaction temperature, which is easier for subsequent handling. For comparison, thermal phosphorization using PH3 or NaH2PO2 requires a large excess of these highly toxic phosphorous precursors. The efficient non-thermal phosphorization is benefited from the unique property of low temperature plasma (such as glow discharge), which is able to generate chemically highly reactive species at mild temperature. In this case, the plasma generated PH radicals are sufficiently reactive for phosphorization and thus only mild heating is required for phosphorous evaporation, i.e. phosphorous evaporation and phosphide formation are decoupled.
Recently, low temperature plasma generated by glow discharge or dielectric barrier discharge have shown unique effects in the modification of electrocatalysts to enhance their performance, including controlled generation of defects in oxide/sulfide OER catalysts and non-destructive activation of the metal sites in the framework structure.26,31,44 The success in controlled phosphide preparation in this work further demonstrates the power of low temperature plasma in electrocatalysis.
In conclusion, using H2 plasma to activate phosphorous vapor enables efficient preparation of phosphide nanostructures at only 250 °C using non-toxic red phosphorous. Highly reactive PH radicals originated from H induced dissociation of the P4 molecules are observed in the optical emission spectrum, which play a critical role in the non-thermal conversion of the NiO nanosheets grown on the Ni foam into the Ni2P nanosheets with the same morphology. The high reactivity of the P precursor and low phosphorization temperature result in complete phosphorization of the NiO nanosheets without affecting the mechanical strength of the Ni foam. The obtained electrode exhibits an excellent hydrogen evolution activity in acid along with good mechanical strength. The new phosphorization method allows phosphorization at mild temperature using non-toxic phosphorous precursors, which is highly desirable for the preparation of phosphide based nanostructures.
