    , Accepted 16th May 2015First published on 18th May 2015AbstractThree-dimensional (3D) BiVO4/Bi2WO6 composite microspheres with enhanced visible-light (λ > 420 nm) photodegradation activity of methylene blue (MB) were synthesized by a simple, one-pot, template-free solvothermal method. A mixture of ethylene glycol (EG) and H2O (volume ratio of EG-H2O was 1:1) was used as the solvent. To investigate the relationship between structure and photocatalytic performance, the as-synthesized samples were characterized by XRD, FESEM, HRTEM, UV-vis DRS, SPS and TPV. Structural characterizations indicated that the composite nanostructure mainly consisted of two single-crystal phases, which were BiVO4 and Bi2WO6. In addition, a possible growth mechanism of this microsphere composite and the separation process of photoinduced charge carriers in the heterojunction are discussed.
Introduction
With increasing amount of energy shortages and environmental crises, environmental purification and energy conversion based on highly efficient photocatalysts and solar cells have attracted increasing attention.1,2 TiO2 nanomaterials were considered to be effective, environmental materials for solving these problems because of their excellent oxidative capacity and chemical stability. However, poor solar efficiency hindered their practical application. For the efficient utilization of solar energy, many researchers were trying to improve the visible light photoresponse and inhibit photoinduced recombination of electrons and holes.3
To date, many efforts have been made to develop bismuth-based nanostructure semiconductors, such as Bi2WO6, BiVO4, BiOX (X = F, Cl, Br, I), and Bi3TaO7, due to their potential applications in visible photo-catalysis, gas sensing and biomedicine.4–7 As an important multicomponent, bismuth vanadates (BiVO4) with narrow bands and chemical stabilities have been reported as a new class of promising semiconductor photocatalysts under visible light irradiation, and importance was focused on the preparation of BiVO4 with large surface area and exposed high-energy facets.8–11 However, the photocatalytic activity of the individual BiVO4 was not yet ideal for practical application. Previous studies had shown that composite photocatalysts could enlarge the spectral responsive range and promote the separation of photoinduced charge carriers, and thus could remarkably improve the photocatalytic activity of an individual semiconductor.12 Therefore, many composites based on nano-BiVO4 have been prepared such as CuO/BiVO4,13 WO3/BiVO4,14 V2O5/BiVO4,15 Co3O4/BiVO4,16 Bi2S3/BiVO417 and BiVO4/TiO2.18 The matching of band levels between Bi2WO6 and BiVO4 made Bi2WO6 another suitable material for constructing heterojunctions with BiVO4.
Herein, we reported the preparation of BiVO4/Bi2WO6 composites with 3D clew-like microspheres by a one-step hydrothermal method. The structures, growth mechanism and optical properties as well as the photocatalytic activity of the composite were studied.
Experimental section
Catalyst preparation
All the chemicals were of analytical grade and were used as received without further purification, and the samples were prepared through a simple solvothermal method.19 In a typical synthesis, the solution marked as solution A was first prepared by dissolving 2.5 mmol of Bi(NO3)3·5H2O in 40 ml of EG with vigorous stirring for 2 h. Some amount of Na3VO4·12H2O and Na2WO4·2H2O were dissolved in 40 ml of deionized H2O and marked as solution B. When solution A and B became clear, the two solutions were mixed and stirred for 2 h until the resulting mixture became homogeneous. Then, the homogeneous suspension was sealed in a 100 mL Teflon-lined autoclave, allowed to stand at 180 °C for 12 h and then cooled to room temperature naturally. The precipitate was collected by centrifugation with deionized water and ethanol and the product was dried at 50 °C under vacuum for 4 h. When we changed the atom ratio of V to W, we obtained a series of samples, and the atom ratios of V to W were 4:1, 1:1 and 1:4. For the purpose of comparison, the pure Bi2WO6 and BiVO4 were prepared through the same method.
Photocatalytic activity test
The photodegradation studies of methylene blue (MB) were carried out in a home-made quartz photochemical reactor. Before the light irradiation, 0.025 g of the photocatalyst was added to a 25 mL aqueous solution of MB (20 mg L−1), the mixture was first sonicated for 5 min and then placed in the dark for 1 h with stirring to reach the adsorption–desorption equilibrium. The light source was a 500 W xenon lamp (CHFXQ500 W) with a UV filter, which can cut-off UV light with a wavelength shorter than 420 nm. At given time intervals, aliquots were withdrawn from the suspension and immediately centrifuged at 10000 rpm for 5 min, and the concentration of MB was determined using an Ocean Optics Miniature Fiber Optic Spectrometer.
Methods
The crystalline phase was examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a Rigaku D/Max-2550 diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54056 Å) at 50 kV and 200 mA in the range of 10°–70° (2θ) at a scanning rate of 10° min−1. The UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra were recorded with a Shimadzu 3600 UV-VIS-NIR spectrophotometer. The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) imaging was performed on a TECNAIG2 TEM microscope (FEI Company).
The surface photovoltage (SPV) measurement system consisted of a source for monochromatic light, a lock-in amplifier (SR830-DSP) with a light chopper (SR540), a photovoltaic cell, and a computer. A 500 W xenon lamp (CHFXQ500 W, Global Xenon Lamp Power) and a double-prism monochromator (Hilger and Watts, D 300) provided a monochromatic light. The samples were studied without further treatment during the SPV measurements, and the contact between samples and the indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode was not Ohmic when carried out by the measurement. The construction of a photovoltaic cell was a sandwich-like structure of ITO–sample–ITO.
The transient photovoltage (TPV) measurement was carried out on a home-made instrument. The samples were excited with a laser radiation pulse (wavelength of 355 nm and pulse width of 5 ns) from a third-harmonic Nd:YAG laser (Polaris II, New Wave Research, Inc.). The TPV signal was recorded by a 500 MHz digital phosphor oscilloscope (TDS 5054, Tektronix). The SPS and TPV measurements were completed in air atmosphere and room temperature.
Results and discussion
The phase and composition of the BiVO4/Bi2WO6 samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), as shown in Fig. 1. The prepared Bi2WO6 was indexed as well-crystallized orthorhombic Bi2WO6 (JCPDS card no. 73-1126) and the prepared BiVO4 was monoclinic (JCPDS card no. 14-0688). When the atom ratio of V to W was 1:4, the diffraction peaks of the composition sample corresponded to the orthorhombic Bi2WO6, and there were no obvious diffraction peaks of BiVO4. When the atom ratio of V to W was 1:1, all the diffraction peaks of the BiVO4/Bi2WO6 sample corresponded to the orthorhombic Bi2WO6 and monoclinic BiVO4, respectively. However, when the ratio was 4:1, the diffraction peaks of orthorhombic Bi2WO6, monoclinic BiVO4 and tetragonal BiVO4 (JCPDS card no. 14-0133) were observed. This indicated that the existence of Bi2WO6 affected the crystallization of BiVO4.

The morphology and microstructure of the BiVO4/Bi2WO6 composites were revealed by FESEM images. As shown in Fig. 2a, Bi2WO6 were microspheres in a clew-like structure with a diameter of 1.0–0.5 μm. The exterior surfaces of the microsphere were rough, and each clew was composed of many crisscrossing nanosheets. Fig. 2b–d are the FESEM images of BiVO4/Bi2WO6 composites. When the atom ratios of V to W were 1:4, 1:1 and 4:1, the composites were obtained as microspheres in a clew-like structure with a diameter of about 2 μm. However, with increasing Na3VO4 content, the morphology of the BiVO4/Bi2WO6 composite considerably changed. When the atom ratio of V to W was 4:1, the composite was a dumbbell-like structure. However, the pure BiVO4 prepared by the same process appeared as flower-like microspheres, as shown in Fig. 2e. Fig. 3 is the HRTEM image of an individual clew-like microsphere with an atom ratio of V to W of 1:1. From the HRTEM image (Fig. 3a), we can see that the microsphere consisted of many interlaced nanosheets. The inset A of Fig. 3b shows that the lattice spacing is 0.315 nm, which is consistent with the spacing of the (133) planes of orthorhombic Bi2WO6. The inset B shows that the lattice spacing is 0.226 nm, which is consistent with the spacing of the (211) planes of monoclinic BiVO4. This indicates that the microsphere included BiVO4 and Bi2WO6 and that the BiVO4 may grow on the surface of the Bi2WO6.

To further study the growth process of BiVO4/Bi2WO6 composites, time-dependent experiments were carefully conducted on the synthesis of the BiVO4/Bi2WO6 composite with the V to W atom ratio of 1:1. The SEM images of four typical samples obtained after solvothermal reaction for 0.5 h, 1 h, 3 h and 6 h at 180 °C are shown in Fig. 4a–d, and the corresponding XRD patterns of the time-dependent evolution of the BiVO4/Bi2WO6 composites are shown in Fig. 5. In the initial stage (at 0.5 h and 1 h), the resulting products are irregular amorphous nanosized particles (Fig. 4a, b and 5). After 3 h, some aggregations built by nanoparticles appeared, and all the XRD diffraction peaks could be indexed to the orthorhombic phase of Bi2WO6. When the reaction time was prolonged to 6 h, uniform, loose hierarchical microspheres were produced with a high yield (Fig. 4d). Further prolonging the reaction time to 12 h resulted in more dense nanosheet packing (Fig. 2c), and the diffraction peaks corresponding to orthorhombic Bi2WO6 and monoclinic BiVO4 were observed.

Based on the results of the time-dependent experiments, it can be inferred that the formation of 3D clew-like BiVO4/Bi2WO6 composites may result from the combined roles of EG under the appropriate reaction conditions. As a stabilizer and coordinating agent, EG coordinated with Bi3+ to produce an alkoxide and decreased the concentration of free Bi3+ ions,19,20 resulting in a relatively slow formation rate of Bi2WO6 and BiVO4; this resulted in the separation of nucleation and growth. The first-born crystal nuclei tended to assemble into submicro-scale solid spheres, driven by the desire to reduce the surface energy of the nanoparticles.21 Moreover, there may have been many free EG molecules adsorbed on the surface of the micro-scaled solid spheres, which may have provided many high-energy nucleation sites for further growth.22 With prolonged hydrothermal treatment time, BiVO4 and Bi2WO6 began to crystallize on these nucleation sites. These nanoparticles preferred to grow into plate-like structures via the Ostwald ripening mechanism because of their high intrinsic anisotropic nature.23
The band gap energy of the BiVO4/Bi2WO6 composite was closely related to its photoabsorption and photocatalytic performance. Fig. 6 shows the UV-vis diffuse absorption spectra of the BiVO4/Bi2WO6 composites with different atomic ratio. The onset of the absorption edge for pure Bi2WO6 was 450 nm, whereas the onset of the absorption edge for pure BiVO4 was about 520 nm, which are consistent with the optical band-gap absorption of pure Bi2WO6 (about 2.7 eV) and pure BiVO4 (2.4 eV).24,25 The absorption edges of the BiVO4/Bi2WO6 composites shifted monotonically to longer wavelength compared with that of pure Bi2WO6.

To evaluate the photocatalytic ability of the prepared composites, we examined the decomposition of methylene blue (MB) in solution over the BiVO4/Bi2WO6 composites under the visible-light (λ > 420 nm) irradiation. Fig. 7 shows the activity of the BiVO4/Bi2WO6 composite catalysts under the visible-light irradiation. When no catalyst was added, the decomposition of MB was almost negligible. About 28.8% and 38.7% of MB was eliminated from the solution in 150 min in the presence of Bi2WO6 and BiVO4, respectively. However, about 55.5% of MB was eliminated in 150 min in the presence of the 1:1 BiVO4/Bi2WO6 composite, which was higher than that in the presence of pure BiVO4 or Bi2WO6. In addition, it is observed that the adsorption percentages of MB from the aqueous solution in the dark on the BiVO4, BiVO4/Bi2WO6(4:1), BiVO4/Bi2WO6(1:1), BiVO4/Bi2WO6(1:4) and BiWO6catalysts were 10%, 11%, 16%, 14% and 20%, respectively. This indicated that the existence of Bi2WO6 was beneficial to the adsorption of MB. Moreover, the BET specific surface areas were 19.2 m2 g−1, 17.1 m2 g−1, 20.2 m2 g−1, 21.5 m2 g−1, and 20.3 m2 g−1, and the degradation efficiencies per unit specific surface area were 0.0201, 0.0257, 0.0274, 0.007, and 0.014 for BiVO4, BiVO4/Bi2WO6(4:1), BiVO4/Bi2WO6(1:1), BiVO4/Bi2WO6(1:4) and BiWO6, respectively.

SPV measurements were used to investigate the transfer behavior of photoinduced charge carriers with high sensitivity to defect states in the sample at its surface, bulk, or any buried interface. It is a contactless and nondestructive method for the investigation of photoinduced charge carrier separation in the photocatalyst system and may provide useful information for understanding the catalytic mechanism of the material.26,27Fig. 8 shows the SPS result of the as-synthesized composites with different atom ratios of V to W. Unlike the UV-vis spectra, which covers all types of photon absorption, the SPS is only sensitive to the electron transition-related processes and subsequent separations. That is to say that the photovoltage response intensity is related to the charge separation efficiency, which signifies that a stronger SPV response intensity indicates a higher separation efficiency of photoinduced charge carriers.28,29 A weaker photovoltage response was observed in the region of 300–450 nm due to the band to band transition of Bi2WO6, and a higher photovoltage response of the BiVO4/Bi2WO6 composites was in the range of 300–520 nm. This indicated that the added BiVO4 not only broadened the photovoltage response range of Bi2WO6, but also enhanced the response intensity. When the atom ratio of V to W was 1:1, the photovoltage response intensity was higher than those of the other composites. This indicated that the 1:1 composite had a higher separation efficiency of photoinduced charge carriers than the other photocatalysts, thus the BiVO4/Bi2WO6 composite (V/W = 1:1) may have higher photocatalytic activity than the others. We speculated that the good crystallinity of the BiVO4/Bi2WO6 composite and an efficient interfacial electric field in the BiVO4/Bi2WO6 composite due to the addition of BiVO4 during the solvothermal process enhanced the separation of photoinduced charge carriers, and that the photovoltage response of BiVO4 was in the region of 300–520 nm due to the band–band transition.

The TPV measurements were carried out to further study the kinetics characteristics of photoinduced charge carrier transfer in the system. Fig. 9 shows the normalized TPV of the as-synthesized BiVO4/Bi2WO6 composites. In the TPV test, the formation of a TPV signal was determined by the fundamental properties of the light absorption and the transport of excess carriers in a semiconductor; a positive sign implied that the positive charges moved toward the surface of the sample that was irradiated by the top electrode, and a negative sign implied that photoinduced electrons moved to the surface of the sample.30,31 The separation and transport of photo-induced charge carriers mainly depended on charge drift under the built-in electrical fields and diffusion under concentration gradients. In Fig. 9, the photovoltage response P1 (t = 5 × 10−6 s) and P2 (about 10−4 s) can be attributed to the drift and diffusion process, respectively. BiVO4 showed a negative TPV response, indicating that the photoinduced electrons moved toward the surface; however, the pure Bi2WO6 showed a positive TPV response signal, indicating that positive charges moved toward the surface. For the (V/W = 1:4) composite, a fast negative photovoltage response and then a positive response were observed. However, for (V/W = 1:1) and (V/W = 4:1) composites, the positive response and the fast negative photovoltage response disappeared. This implied that the existence of an interfacial electric field changed the transfer direction of the photoinduced charge carriers.
 Fig. 9  Normalized TPV of BiVO4/Bi2WO6 composites with different molar ratios. The wavelength and intensity of the laser pulse are 355 nm and 200 μJ, respectively. 
To further investigate the transfer character of photoinduced charge carriers, we made two more composite samples: the sample of Sv/w with BiVO4 growth on the surface of Bi2WO6 (we first made Bi2WO6, and then added Bi(NO3)3 and NaVO4 to induce BiVO4 growth on the surface of Bi2WO6) and the sample of Sw/v with Bi2WO6 growth on the surface of BiVO4. The TPV results are shown in Fig. 10. From Fig. 10, we found that the Sv/w with BiVO4 growth on the surface of Bi2WO6 shows a positive TPV response, which indicated that photoinduced holes assembled on the surface of BiVO4 and were detected. However, the Sw/v sample of Bi2WO6 growth on the surface of BiVO4 showed a negative TPV response, which indicated that photoinduced electrons assembled on the surface of Bi2WO6 and were detected. This process not only facilitated the separation of photoinduced charge carriers but also facilitated the accumulation of electrons and holes in Bi2WO6 and BiVO4, respectively. Thus, the possible mechanism of the heterojunction composites under visible light irradiation is shown in Fig. 11. The conduction band of the Bi2WO6 was more positive than that of BiVO4 and the valence band of the BiVO4 was more negative than that of the Bi2WO6. When the composite was irradiated, the photoinduced electrons in the BiVO4 conduction band transferred to the conduction band of Bi2WO6, and the photoinduced holes in the Bi2WO6 valence band were transferred to the valence band of BiVO4.

Conclusions
In summary, we have successfully synthesized 3D BiVO4/Bi2WO6 composites by a one-pot, template-free, solvothermal method. SPS and TPV results indicated that the photoinduced charge carrier separation in the BiVO4/Bi2WO6 composite was promoted under the effect of an interfacial electric field. In BiVO4/Bi2WO6 composites, the photoinduced electrons in the conduction band of BiVO4 were transferred to the conduction band of Bi2WO6. When the atom ratio of V to W was 1:1, the BiVO4/Bi2WO6 composite exhibited the best photocatalytic activity in the degradation of MB under visible light irradiation.
