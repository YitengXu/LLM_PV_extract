    , Accepted 20th June 2014First published on 24th June 2014AbstractIn this paper, we describe relationships between the morphologies and the power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of perovskite photovoltaics having a conventional p–i–n heterojunction structure, indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrenesulfonate (PEDOT:PSS)/CH3NH3PbI3−xClx/PC61BM/Al. The PCE of such a device is highly dependent on the morphology of the perovskite film, which is governed by the concentrations of its precursors and the annealing conditions. A two-step annealing process allowed sufficient crystallization of the perovskite material, with a high coverage at a high precursor concentration. Relative to the device prepared using a one-step process (90 °C for 30 min), we observed a 60% increase in PCE for this optimized device. The corresponding devices exhibited extremely high stability after long-term storage (>1368 h) in the dark in a N2-filled glove box, with consistently high PCEs (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2) of up to 9.1%.
Introduction
Inorganic/organic hybrid structures based on organic lead halides (in particular CH3NH3PbX3, where X is I or Cl) have much potential for harvesting renewable energy because they exhibit excellent performance, with power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) reaching above 15%.1–4 Several research groups have demonstrated their applicability to flexible substrates,5–8 making them amenable for inexpensive large-area fabrication through low-temperature processing. Two main types of highly efficient devices based on organic lead trihalides have been reported. The first type possesses the classical geometry of a solid state dye-sensitized solar cell, with the perovskite layer deposited on top of a mesoporous TiO2 layer presenting various hole transporting layers (HTLs).2,9,10 The second one features a simpler architecture with the active materials, deposited either from solution11,12 or through vapor deposition,3 sandwiched between the HTLs [2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) or conducting polymers, most commonly poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrenesulfonate (PEDOT:PSS)] and the electron conducting layers (ETLs) (TiO2, PCBM, or ZnO).5,7,8,11–17
Organic lead trihalides exhibit highly ambipolar transport, allowing electrons and holes to diffuse over distances exceeding several hundreds of nanometers with balanced transport lengths.18,19 By varying the halide composition20 and the size of the alkylammonium cation,10,21 the band gap can be tuned between 1.4 and 2.3 eV. These characteristics allow such films to be efficient absorbers, with internal quantum efficiencies of almost 100%, and capable of replacing HTLs and ETLs in hybrid cells. Snaith et al. have reported the first planar device architectures based on a planar solution-processed organic lead trihalide, with the perovskite layer (CH3NH3PbI3−xClx) sandwiched between the compact TiO2 and spiro-OMeTAD, with PCEs of up to 14.2%.3,21 Guo et al. have first reported a perovskite (CH3NH3PbI3) cell with PEDOT:PSS as HTL and fullerenes as ETL with a PCE of 3.9%.11 Very recently, PEDOT:PSS and fullerenes-based perovskite cells showed PCE of over 11% through device engineering.5,22,23
Two of the main challenges encountered in the fabrication of solution-processed perovskite films involve controlling the crystallization process and ensuring high film quality. When the perovskite layers are deposited through spin-casting, both thermodynamic and kinetic effects will determine their morphologies. From a thermodynamic point of view, the intrinsic properties of the components of the solution (various organic lead halide materials and the solvent) used to deposit the active film—including the ratio of organic salt to lead halide, their interactions, and the solubility of the organic lead halide materials—play key roles during the evolution of the film morphology.11,12,21,23,24 During the solidification process, several kinetic factors—including the solvent evaporation rate, the nature of any additives, post-treatment conditions, and the crystallization behavior—can have significant effects on the morphological evolution.23,25 Several approaches12,23,25,26 have been reported to effectively control the morphology of the perovskite layer and, hence, improve the performance of PSCs. Nevertheless, there remains considerable room for further enhancements in PCE through careful optimization of morphologies and device architectures.
Our goal for this study was to optimize the properties of the perovskite absorber layer through the use of a two-step annealing process. Motivated by the low-temperature solution processability of the perovskite layer, we adopted a conventional p–i–n heterojunction architecture—indium tin oxide (ITO)PEDOT:PSS/CH3NH3PbI3−xClx/PC61BM/Al—to study the influence of the perovskite film morphology on the device performance. We then performed experiments to determine correlations among the processing concentration, temperature, time period, and the quality and morphology of the derived films. We used tapping-mode atomic force microscopy (AFM), UV-vis spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction (XRD) to examine the relationship between the film quality and the device performance. We investigated the performance and stability of devices fabricated under various conditions. Because perovskite films are extremely unstable until fully crystallized,12 the second annealing step allowed them to further crystallize without significantly changing their morphology; accordingly, we observed enhanced performance and improved stability. The resulting devices displayed extremely high stability after long-term storage (>1368 h) in the dark in a N2-filled glove box, with constantly high PCEs of up to 9.1%.
Results and discussion
We prepared the perovskite precursor solution by dissolving methylammonium iodide (MAI) and lead(II) chloride (at a molar ratio of 3:1) in dimethylformamide (DMF). To investigate how the morphologies of perovskite layers evolved over time, we employed AFM (tapping mode) to characterize their topographies. For direct comparison, we prepared the films for AFM analysis under the same conditions as those for device fabrication. We fabricated the perovskite devices having the layered configuration glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/CH3NH3PbI3−xClx/PC61BM/Al, which is similar to an organic photovoltaic using methods similar to those we had reported previously.27–30 Prior to deposition of the perovskite layer, we preheated the PEDOT:PSS film at 60 °C for 5 min. The precursor solution was also preheated at 60 °C for 5 min and then deposited on top of the PEDOT:PSS film. We deposited the PCBM from a chlorobenzene solution (10 mg mL−1) through spin-coating (2000 rpm). We then thermally deposited layers of Al (100 nm) under vacuum.

Fig. 1 displays the AFM topographies of the perovskite films. We observed a dramatic change in the morphology of the films upon changing the concentration of the precursor and the annealing conditions. The coverage and morphology of the films (prepared by annealing for 5 min at 100 °C, the most common annealing temperature for perovskite cells) changed upon changing the concentration of the solution. We fabricated these films at a constant spin-coating rate; hence, the thicker films were derived from solutions of higher concentration. The thickness of the film obtained from the solution at 10, 15, 20, and 25 wt% were approximately 110, 150, 170, and 210 nm, respectively. The root-mean-square (rms) roughnesses of the films obtained from the solutions at 10, 15, 20, and 25 wt% were 9.6, 9.8, 16.7, and 35.1 nm, respectively. We used ImageJ to calculate the coverage of these films; the surface coverage of the films obtained from the solutions at 10, 15, 20, and 25 wt% were 83, 78, 75, and 72%, respectively. A rougher surface was accompanied by a lower surface coverage. Upon increasing the concentration of the solution, the average pore size increased, with fewer pores per unit area, and the films became coarser. Snaith et al. have observed similar phenomena from their study of perovskite layers deposited on FTO/TiO2 substrates.12 We used UV-vis absorption spectroscopy and XRD to investigate the effect of the precursor concentration on light absorption and crystal structure of the perovskite films prepared under various conditions. Fig. S1† reveals that all the films featured absorption onsets at 800 nm with broad absorption ranges from the visible to the near-infrared. Higher optical density resulted from a higher precursor concentration, due to the greater thickness of the sample. Fig. 2 presents grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) profiles of crystalline perovskite thin films on PEDOT:PSS, prepared from different concentrations of the precursor solution and under various annealing conditions. Here, the azimuthally integrated scattering intensity of the different GIWAXS patterns has been plotted against the scattering vector q (equal to 4π sinθ/λ), θ is half of the total scattering angle, and λ is the X-ray wavelength (0.145 nm). The X-ray diffraction patterns of the films annealed at 100 °C are consistent with that expected for CH3NH3PbI3−xClx.31 We attribute the scattering peak at a value of q of 10 nm−1 to the (110) plane of the CH3NH3PbI3−xClx perovskite structure.31 The diffraction patterns are distinctly different from those of MAI and PbCl2.31 For a film featuring a crystalline precursor structure, a peak will appear at a value of q of 11 nm−1, representing incomplete crystallization of the perovskite. We found that the film derived from the 25 wt% solution had this crystalline precursor structure, suggesting that annealing at 100 °C for 5 min was insufficient for full crystallization of this thicker perovskite structure. Notably, the generation of an opaque appearance and the transformation in color from yellow to dark brown, both of which can be observed clearly with the naked eye, were incomplete for the film derived from the 25 wt% solution. Perovskite films will degrade into PbI2 after prolonged thermal treatment at elevated temperatures, accompanied with the appearance of a scattering peak at a value of q of 9 nm−1.26,31 Accordingly, we considered to apply annealing temperatures and times in this study that would not induce the degradation of CH3NH3PbI3−xClx into PbI2. Because we performed GIWAXS measurements in an ambient environment, it was possible that degradation on the surface of the perovskite film arose from moisture in the air or damage induced by the X-ray beam.12,31 Our GIWAXS data indicated that annealing at 100 °C for 5 min was sufficient to transfer the precursor to the perovskite structure when the concentration of the precursor solution ranged from 10 to 20 wt%. A further increase in the thickness of the perovskite layer resulted in the evidence for the crystalline precursor phase (Fig. 2).

Table 1 summarizes the open circuit voltages (VOC), short circuit current densities (JSC), fill factors (FFs), and PCEs of the devices prepared by annealing at 100 °C for 5 min; the numbers in parentheses are average device performances determined from four fabricated devices. The value of JSC of the device increased from 9.6 to 15.3 mA cm−2 upon increasing the concentration of the precursor solution from 10 to 20 wt%. The concentration-dependent trend in PCE can be explained by considering the morphological and absorption properties of the films shown in Fig. 1 and S1.† Increasing the concentration from 10 to 20 wt% resulted simply in a thicker film and, thus, an increased degree of absorption as well as an increased value of JSC. In contrast, the values of VOC and the FFs decreased significantly for the devices prepared using a higher concentration of the precursor solution. Further increasing its concentration to 25 wt% caused the PCE to decrease significantly, with a large fluctuation. Poor OPV performance is typically associated with discrete islands and a large pore size. This hypothesis is reasonable; effective free carrier generation will be limited by poor film coverage and, thereby, causes unsatisfactory performance. As a result, the highest PCE was that for our device prepared using the lowest precursor concentration (10 wt%); this cell exhibited a PCE of 6.8%, JSC of 9.6 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.95 V, and an FF of 74.3% (Fig. 3a). To confirm the accuracy of our PCE measurements, we also measured external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of our devices. The EQE response of the device fabricated from a precursor concentration of 10 wt% reveals (Fig. 3b) a significant contribution at wavelengths between 350 and 800 nm and is consistent with the absorption spectrum of a perovskite film, with the maximum EQE appearing near 500 nm. Convolution of the spectral response with the photon flux AM 1.5G spectrum provided an estimate for the value of JSC of the device under irradiation of 9.0 mA cm−2. Because of a mismatch between the EQE and the photon flux AM 1.5G, there was an approximately 6% mismatch between the convolution and solar simulator data.

Next, we fabricated perovskite films using a fixed concentration (20 wt%) of the precursor solution, but different annealing conditions. As revealed in Fig. 1e–h, the number of pores in the final film decreased upon increasing the annealing temperature, but their size increased and the morphology transitioned from continuous layers into a discrete isolated perovskite structure. The rms roughnesses of the films annealed at 80 °C (60 min), 90 °C (30 min), 110 °C (5 min), and 120 °C (5 min) were 16.3, 16.7, 22.3, and 47.9 nm, respectively. The surface coverages of the films annealed at 80 °C (60 min), 90 °C (30 min), 110 °C (5 min), and 120 °C (5 min) were 91, 89, 83, and 77%, respectively. Upon increasing the annealing temperature, the surface coverage decreased, associated with a rougher surface. Significant coarsening and the presence of large CH3NH3PbI3−xClx crystals had the effect of decreasing the surface coverage. This result can be explained primarily by considering that the kinetics of film formation is influenced by the rate of perovskite crystallization. At a higher annealing temperature, the perovskite crystallized more quickly, thereby resulting in the morphologies displayed in Fig. 1h. The role of the annealing temperature during the conversion process to form a perovskite layer has been discussed recently by the Grätzel26 and Snaith/Wiesner12,31 groups, using FTO/mTiO2 and FTO/mTiO2/alumina scaffold substrates, respectively. They found that increasing the annealing temperature caused films to transform into distinct island-like morphologies. Furthermore, they noted that a higher PbI2 content in the film during annealing at elevated temperatures destroyed the performance of the device.26 In the present study, we used a different substrate (ITO/PEDOT) to deposit the perovskite layer, yet we observed a similar phenomenon: the annealing temperature critically impacted the morphology of the resulting perovskite film. Indeed, the effect of the annealing temperature was more sensitive when using PEDOT as the substrate than it was in those previous studies, in which the perovskite layers were more confined by mesoporous structures.26,31 In our present study, we observed a dramatic change in morphology after a short annealing process. We conclude that the film coverage was high, with a number of small pores, when the annealing temperature was below 110 °C. Further increasing the temperature led to an increase in either the pore size or the size of the crystallites. These results suggest that the fabrication conditions might be limited to a combination of a low precursor concentration and an annealing temperature below 100 °C. In addition to the coverage, the crystallinity of perovskite domains also determines the performance of corresponding devices because defects in the crystals will create severe shorting and trapping sites for charge recombination; furthermore, they will affect charge dissociation, transport, and diffusion length.23 Fig. S2† presents UV-vis spectra of the films, each of which absorbed a wide range of light from the visible to the near-infrared, consistent with the formation of CH3NH3PbI3−xClx perovskite on the substrate. We observed changes in the intensity and shape of the signals in the absorption spectra upon increasing the annealing temperature of the perovskite layers from 80 to 120 °C, with an increase in the absorbance at higher wavelengths indicating that the degree of conversion was relatively high at higher annealing temperatures. We further examined the structures using XRD. Fig. 2 reveals similar diffraction patterns for the various films, indicating the successful formation of perovskite structures under these annealing conditions. To the best of our knowledge, the relationship between the UV-vis spectra and XRD patterns of perovskite layers on PEDOT:PSS has not been described so far; herein, we reveal that the morphology and optoelectronic properties depend markedly on the annealing conditions.

Table 1 displays the PV characteristics of perovskite devices prepared using a precursor solution at a concentration of 20 wt% and various annealing conditions. We observed an increase in PCE when we increased the temperature from 80 to 100 °C. The values of JSC and VOC and the FF increased slightly for the device annealed at 100 °C for 5 min, providing a PCE of 5.6%. Further increases in the annealing temperature led to significant decreases in PCE, due to lower values of JSC and VOC and the FF. When we examined the UV-vis spectra and the AFM morphology, we found that higher values of JSC were associated with high-intensity, longer-wavelength absorptions, while the values of VOC and FF were related significantly to both the morphology and surface coverage. At higher annealing temperatures, the morphology will dominate the PCE, rather than the absorption. Our results suggest that decreasing the thickness of the film will generally lower the value of JSC, while incomplete thermal treatment will lead to inefficient electron/hole separation, thereby decreasing the values of VOC and FF. The transport of effective carriers to their corresponding electrodes will be disfavored within an inappropriate morphology. Low annealing temperatures (<100 °C) will lead to removal of the solvent from the solution, allowing the perovskite to grow into a uniform film with high coverage and a continuous phase, but will not lead to the formation of intact perovskite. In contrast, the performance of devices treated at high annealing temperatures will be limited by the concentration of the precursor solution used to fabricate the devices. To obtain a high-quality and thick perovskite layer, the annealing temperature must be restricted; to ensure optimal performance, both high annealing temperature and a thick perovskite layer are necessary. Nevertheless, these parameters must be traded-off, making it a challenge to design and fabricate devices to meet the requirements for highly efficient PV applications.
We varied the annealing conditions as well as the concentration of the perovskite while monitoring the resulting morphologies; we used the I–V characteristics to qualitatively determine the optimization of this process. We found that the morphology of the perovskite film could be optimized using a simple and very effective two-step annealing process: first at 90 °C for 30 min and then at 100 °C for 2 min. Fig. 1i–l present AFM images of the two-step-treated perovskite layers obtained at precursor concentrations ranging from 10 to 25 wt%. The rms roughnesses of the films derived from 10, 15, 20, and 25 wt% solutions were 11.2, 12.0, 14.1, and 19.4 nm, respectively. The surface coverages of the films derived from 10, 15, 20, and 25 wt% solutions were 88, 90, 88, and 85%, respectively. As the concentration increased, the surface became rougher. All the films contained pinholes and voids, but the two-step-assisted film already revealed a markedly improved surface coverage at a higher concentration (20 wt%). In addition, the well-defined XRD patterns (Fig. 3) suggest the generation of order during this two-step annealing process. Two-step annealing also enhanced the crystallization of CH3NH3PbI3−xClx, as is evident from the absorption spectra in Fig. S3.† When compared with the spectrum of the film annealed at 90 °C for 30 min, the spectrum of the perovskite processed by annealing for an additional 2 min at 100 °C exhibited clearly increased light absorption across the visible range and into the near-infrared. The intensity enhancement at the band-edge absorption around 450–790 nm confirmed the improved crystallinity of these processed perovskite films (Fig. S4†). The improved surface coverage and uniform crystal formation in these perovskite thin films were responsible for their increased absorption. The greater coverage and smoothness of the two-step-assisted films prepared at higher precursor concentrations suggest that this process induced homogenous nucleation and enhanced the kinetics of the transformation sufficiently to ensure better-crystallized perovskite within a thicker layer.

Table 1 summarizes the performance of these devices. A lower solid content of the precursor (<20 wt%) led to inefficient light harvesting because it resulted in thinner perovskite layers. Increasing the precursor content caused the values of both JSC and the FF to increase. The concentration-dependent trend in performance can be explained by taking a closer look at the optical and morphological properties of the perovskite films. Increasing the concentration of the precursor from 10 to 20 wt% simply resulted in a thicker film and, thus, increased absorption intensity (see Fig. S3†) and an increased value of JSC; meanwhile, the morphological features were responsible for the changes in the FFs (Fig. 1i–l). The optimal precursor concentration was approximately 20 wt%; the resulting device exhibited a PCE of 7.5%, with values of JSC, VOC, and FF of 14.3 mA cm−2, 0.86 V, and 0.609, respectively (Fig. 3a). Relative to the device prepared using a one-step process (90 °C for 30 min), we observed a 60% increase in PCE for this optimized device. Relative to the device fabricated from a precursor concentration of 20 wt% using a one-step annealing temperature (100 °C), we observed an increase in PCE from 5.6 to 7.6%. The value of VOC and the FF increased significantly, due to the improved morphology associated with lower roughness and higher surface coverage. The EQE response of the device fabricated from a precursor concentration of 20 wt% reveals (Fig. 3b) a significant contribution at wavelengths between 350 and 800 nm and is consistent with the absorption spectrum of a perovskite film, with the maximum EQE appearing near 510 nm. Convolution of the spectral response with the photon flux AM 1.5G spectrum provided an estimate for the value of JSC of the device under irradiation of 13.3 mA cm−2. Further increasing the concentration of the precursor caused the value of JSC to decrease, accompanied by a significantly lower FF and a decrease in PCE from 7.5 to 3.7%. The device derived from the 25 wt% precursor solution experienced a higher total absorption with a significant change in the spectral shape; nevertheless, it displayed poor performance because of an unfavorable morphology. These phenomena correlate with a transition in morphology to a new regime dominated by the formation of overlaying rod-like crystallites, consistent with the significant decreases in the values of JSC and FF. Notably, this change can be gleaned from the appearance of the films; we observed a change in color and the generation of an opaque phase, due to excessive crystallization, for the 25 wt%-derived film. To further confirm the two-step annealing process as the universal rule for enhancing the PCE of perovskite cells, we fabricated the devices at 70 and 80 °C for 30 min and other devices with additional heating at 100 °C for 2 min; Table S1† lists their PV characteristics. The transformation from precursor to perovskite under the annealing condition of 70 °C for 30 min was incomplete; clearly observable with the naked eye, the films retained their yellow color throughout this process. The resulting device derived at 70 °C exhibited no PV response. When we applied additional annealing at 100 °C, we observed a transformation in color from yellow to dark brown, suggesting the formation of the perovskite structure. The resulting device exhibited a PCE of 6.2%, with values of JSC, VOC, and FF of 9.0 mA cm−2, 0.96 V, and 0.72, respectively. The PCEs increased to 6.7% for the two-step annealed device from the value of 5.1% for the cell annealed at 80 °C for 30 min (Table S1†). Low-temperature annealing (i.e., heating at 80 and 90 °C) allowed the perovskite to grow with a high-coverage uniform morphology, but did not lead to the formation of intact perovskite. High-temperature annealing (>100 °C) increased either the roughness or the size of the crystallites, accompanied with decreased surface coverage; hence, it decreased the PCE of the derived devices. Our results suggest that the two-step annealing process improved the surface coverage and led to a thicker, continuous, crystallized morphology, thereby improving the device performance.
Long-term stability in a wide range of environments is the biggest challenge faced by perovskite-based PV devices. Only a few reports have described the stability of perovskite. Grätzel2 studied the stability of well-encapsulated mesoscopic TiO2-derived perovskite cells by subjecting them to long-term light exposure (light intensity: 100 mW cm−2; temperature: 45 °C). They observed very promising long-term stability: the photovoltaic device maintained greater than 80% of its initial PCE after a period of 500 h. Seok et al. have investigated the stability of unencapsulated FTO/TiO2/CH3NH3Pb(I1−xBrx)3/polytriarylamine(PTAA)/Au devices under low-humidity (35%) air in the dark.20 They found that the stability of perovskite cells could be controlled by varying the composition of the halide. Our interest in determining the stability of perovskite devices statistically led us to study the degradation of the devices over time29,32 inside a N2-filled glove box in the dark. Known mechanisms for the degradation of organic devices include O2- and H2O-mediated degradation of the active layer, electrode, and interfacial layer; morphological changes, electrode diffusion and reaction of the electrode with the organic materials.33 The International Summit on OPV Stability (ISOS-D-1) standard has suggested recording the degradation of organic devices in an ambient environment.32 As suggested by Krebs et al., we have determined the shelf-life stability [ISOS-D-1 (shelf)] of our novel devices by leaving samples in the dark with no load under ambient conditions (defined, in general, as 23 °C/50% RH). When we examined the stability of our unencapsulated devices using this accepted consensus protocol, we found that the devices were sensitive to the ambient conditions, typically observing a value of T80 (the time period required for the PCE of a device to decay by 20% of its initial value) of 3 h. To systematically and accurately evaluate the stability of the devices over various periods of time, we stored them inside a glove box so that we could ignore the effects of O2 and water, due to the uncertainty of encapsulation. We examined the stability of our best-performing cells, the 20 wt%/two-step annealing-derived cells. Fig. 4 and Table S2† summarize the PCEs of the devices with respect to time. We observed improved PCEs for the devices. The PCE of the best device increased from 7.5 to 9.1% after storage for 1368 h; this enhancement was accompanied with an increased FF, from 60.9 to 67.9%, while the values of JSC and VOC slightly increased. After storage for 1368 h (eight weeks), this cell exhibited a PCE of 9.1%, JSC of 14.7 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.91 V, and a FF of 67.9% (Fig. 3b). We observed similar phenomena for other devices, with an increase in FF and, hence, an increase in PCE after the long-term storage (Table S2† and Fig. 4). To the best of our knowledge, the stability of PEDOT:PSS-based perovskite cells has not been described so far. Our observations suggest that the ITO/PEDOT:PSS/CH3NH3PbI3−xClx/PC61BM/Al device structures were stable at room temperature under N2. We are currently performing further investigation to identify the phenomenon behind the enhancement in PCE of the cell during long-term storage in the dark under N2. Nevertheless, there remains considerable room for improvement in performance and for further understanding of the stability of such devices through optimization of their morphologies and architectures.

Conclusions
We have demonstrated a two-step annealing process for improving the performance of CH3NH3PbI3−xClx-based perovskite cells. The morphological transformations of perovskite films are driven by a combination of the annealing temperatures and times and the thicknesses of the films. We found that two-step annealing endowed the films with improved surface coverage and a thicker, continuous, crystallized morphology, thereby improving the performance; indeed, the PCE increased to 7.5% from a value of 4.7% for the corresponding cell prepared using the same precursor concentration and annealing at a temperature of 90 °C for 30 min. The two-step annealed devices displayed extremely high stability, after long-term storage in the dark in a N2-filled glove box for over 1368 h providing consistently high PCEs of up to 9.1%.

Device fabrication and characterization. 
Perovskite-based PV cells were prepared using the following device fabrication procedure. Glass/ITO substrates [Sanyo, Japan (8 Ω □−1)] were sequentially patterned lithographically, cleaned with a detergent, ultrasonicated in acetone and isopropyl alcohol, dried on a hot plate at 140 °C for 10 min, and treated with oxygen plasma for 5 min. PEDOT:PSS (Baytron P-VP AI4083) was passed through a 0.45 μm filter and deposited onto ITO (thickness: ca. 40 nm) through spin-coating at 3000 rpm in air; the sample was then dried at 140 °C for 20 min inside a glove box. The perovskite precursor solution was prepared by dissolving MAI and lead(II) chloride at ratio of 3:1 (molar ratio) at different concentrations in DMF and continuously stirring at 60 °C in the dark overnight. Perovskite devices, having the layered configuration glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/CH3NH3PbI3−xClx/PC61BM/Al, were fabricated using methods similar to those reported previously.27,28 Prior to deposition of the perovskite layer, the PEDOT:PSS film was preheated at 60 °C for 5 min. The precursor solution was also preheated at 60 °C for 5 min and then deposited on top of the PEDOT:PSS. PCBM was spin-coated (2000 rpm) from a chlorobenzene solution (10 mg mL−1). The layers of Al (100 nm) were deposited thermally under vacuum. The active area of the device was 10 mm2. The cell performance was measured inside a glove box. The current–voltage (I–V) properties of the devices were measured using a computer-controlled Keithley 2400 source measurement unit (SMU) and a Newport solar simulator (Oriel® Sol2A Class ABA Solar Simulators) under AM 1.5 illumination (100 mW cm−2). The illumination intensity was calibrated using a standard Si reference cell and a KG-5 filter. EQEs were measured using an Enlitech QE-R spectral response measurement system to calibrate the current densities of the devices. Morphologies of the polymer films were analyzed by AFM using a VEECO DICP-II instrument operated in tapping mode at ambient temperature; the etched Si probe exhibited a resonant frequency of 131 kHz and a spring constant of 11 N m−1. GIWAXS patterns were collected on Philips Panalytical-X'PertPROMRD, the incident beam angle was above the critical angle (∼0.5°).
