    , Accepted 21st December 2021First published on 25th December 2021AbstractA bifunctional NiMoFe/Cu NW core–shell catalyst assembled into a practical solar-driven overall water splitting system leads to an unprecedented solar-to-hydrogen (STH) efficiency of 10.99% in neutral electrolytes, attributed to the synergic combination of a unique 3D self-supported core–shell architecture and rapid electron/mass transfer properties.
Hydrogen production from electrochemical water splitting driven by clean renewable energy has been considered as a promising technology to solve the energy crisis and alleviate environmental problems.1,2 In general, the two half-reactions involved in a water splitting process, that is, the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), are known to be kinetically sluggish and usually proceed at high overpotentials.3–6 To this end, earth-abundant bifunctional electrocatalysts that can simultaneously accelerate both the HER and OER are particularly appealing because of the low cost, convenient operation, and simplified processes.7–9 Currently, most bifunctional electrocatalysts have been researched based on alkaline solutions where the OER is favorable, however this may bring problems in their large-scale practical applications due to corrosion and related environmental problems.10,11 Therefore, neutral-pH water splitting is attractive, but only limited success has been made owing to the lack of efficient and durable neutral-pH bifunctional catalysts.10,12
Although the present mechanisms for neutral HER are still debatable, water dissociation is generally postulated to be the rate-determining step.12,13 Recently, alloying Ni with Mo was found to be a promising HER catalyst due to the reduced energy barrier on the water dissociation step.14–16 Unfortunately, the NiMo alloy suffers from an extremely poor intrinsic OER activity.17 Meanwhile, incorporation of Fe into Ni-based oxides has been reported as an efficient catalyst for OER, although their electrical resistance is not so favorable for charge transfer.18,19 Nevertheless, NiMoFe-based catalysts are expected to be bifunctional candidates for neutral overall water splitting, and surprisingly, less attention has been paid to this field.
In addition to intrinsic activity, the rational design of electrode architecture is also very crucial especially in neutral electrolytes, because of the low ion concentration that causes large Ohmic loss.20,21 In terms of the synthesis of NiMo alloys, a facile and effective electrodeposition process is usually adopted, however, the large reduction potential difference between Mo and Ni precursors would result in poor control over the crystalline structure and morphology, and usually a dense NiMo film is obtained.14,22 Herein, we demonstrated the integration of a NiMoFe alloy into Cu nanowires (denoted as NiMoFe/Cu NWs) as a three-dimensional (3D) core–shell catalyst for both HER and OER under neutral conditions. The Cu NW core has good conductivity for charge transfer and its nanowire microstructure provides a skeleton for the bifunctional but thin catalyst layer. The resultant water electrolyzer assembled with NiMoFe/Cu NWs endows a low voltage of 1.82 V at 10 mA cm−2 and a sustainable stability of over 48 h at 50 mA cm−2 for overall water splitting, outperforming most of the recent state-of-the-art noble-metal-free neutral-pH electrolyzers. Combined with a common photovoltaic cell, the NiMoFe/Cu NW based water electrolyzer can implement splitting of a neutral electrolyte with a high solar-to-hydrogen (STH) conversion efficiency of 10.99%, which is remarkable when compared with that of the NiFeMo alloy deposited directly on Cu foam (3.57%). We attribute this performance to the synergic combination of a unique 3D self-supported core–shell architecture and rapid electron/mass transfer properties, giving rise to abundant active sites and high inherent HER and OER activity. These findings provide a deeper understanding of the structure–activity relationship for designing more efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts in neutral water electrolysis.
The fabrication procedure for the NiMoFe/Cu NWs is illustrated in Fig. S1 (ESI†), and the fabrication details are shown in the Supplementary Information (see the ESI†). First, Cu nanowires are in situ grown on Cu foam (CF) through anodization in a 1.0 M NaOH solution, calcination in air and subsequent electro-reduction in a 0.5 M KHCO3 solution (Fig. S2 in the ESI†). Secondly, the NiMoFe alloy is coated conformally on the Cu NWs by electrodeposition in a precursor solution at a constant cathodic current of −200 mA cm−2 for 120 s, leading to the formation of the self-supported NiMoFe/Cu NW core–shell structures. The successful fabrication of the above samples is reflected by the optical images, in which an apparent color change and uniformity are displayed (Fig. S3, ESI†). For comparison, other control samples such as NiMoFe/Cu, NiMo/Cu NWs and NiFe/Cu NWs were also fabricated using a similar process.
The morphologies of the samples have been investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The SEM images of both CF and NiMoFe/CF show the smooth surface morphology (Fig. S4a and b, ESI†). In contrast, roughly vertically standing nanowire structures are observed for the Cu NWs and NiMoFe/Cu NWs (Fig. 1a and Fig. S4c, ESI†). Fig. 1b shows the zoomed-in SEM image of the Cu NWs with a diameter about 150 nm. After coating the NiMoFe alloy, the overall morphology remained relatively similar except for a larger diameter (Fig. 1c). For comparison, the SEM images of the respective NiMo and NiFe alloy on Cu NWs were also provided (Fig. S5, ESI†). The TEM image in Fig. 1d distinctly shows that the Cu NW core is conformally coated with an ∼38 nm shell of the NiMoFe alloy. Fig. 1e is a high-resolution TEM image of the NiMoFe alloy, in which the lattice spacings of 0.17 and 0.20 nm can be assigned to the (200) and (111) planes of metallic Ni, respectively.23 This reveals that Mo and Fe occurs in co-deposition with Ni during the electrodeposition process. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern in Fig. 1f presents a series of diffraction rings, which can be indexed to the (111) plane of metallic Cu and (200), and the (220) and (311) planes of metallic Ni,23 suggesting the polycrystalline nature of the outer NiMoFe alloy. Furthermore, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) elemental mapping clearly shows that Cu is more likely to gather as cores, while Ni, Mo and Fe are uniformly distributed outside of Cu cores (Fig. 1g). The Ni:Mo:Fe atomic ratio was determined to be 97.1:1.5:1.4 using EDS spectroscopy (Fig. S6, ESI†).

The crystalline structure of the various samples was then investigated using X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Fig. S7a, ESI†). Besides the stronger peaks from the Cu substrate, the three peaks located at 44.5°, 51.8° and 76.4° were in good agreement with the (111), (200) and (220) planes of face-centered cubic Ni (JCPDS No. 04-0850), respectively. No peaks assigned to the Mo and Fe related compositions are observed, which means that Mo and Fe are successfully alloyed with Ni, which is in line with the TEM results. X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was introduced to further investigate the chemical composition and surface state of the NiMoFe/Cu NW sample. The survey spectrum of the NiMoFe/Cu NWs clearly reveals the existence of Ni, Mo, Fe and Cu signals, which is consistent with the EDS results (Fig. S8, ESI†). The Ni 2p peaks at 852.2 and 869.5 eV, the Mo 3d peaks at 227.5 and 231 eV and the Fe 2p peaks at 706.6 and 719.8 eV, which can be recognized as the typical features of Ni0, Mo0 and Fe0, respectively, indicate the formation of a metal alloy film on the Cu NW substrate (Fig. S7b–d, ESI†). Besides the metallic characteristic peak, their oxidation peaks are also presented, which confirm the natural surface oxide in the alloy layer. Characterizations of the other bimetallic samples such as the NiFe and NiMo alloys were also performed (Fig. S9 and S10, ESI†). Thus, the combined analysis of the above results indicates the formation of NiMoFe/Cu NW core–shell nanostructures.
The HER and OER properties of the as-prepared electrodes were evaluated in a 1.0 M PBS aqueous solution (see the details in the ESI†). The catalytic performance of the NiMoFe/Cu NW samples fabricated with various molar ratios of Fe(NO3)3·9H2O were first studied, and the NiMoFe/Cu NWs synthesized with 2.5 mM Fe(NO3)3·9H2O exhibited the best catalytic activity in both HER and OER (Fig. S11, ESI†). Fig. 2a shows the HER polarization curves of various electrodes. Adopting the photocurrent at −10 mA cm−2 as a standard, the NiMoFe/Cu NWs exhibit a low overpotential η10 of 45 mV, which is comparable to that of the NiMo/Cu NWs (44 mV), indicating that the presence of Fe species has little effect on the HER activity. The above two Mo-containing electrodes exhibit a significantly lower overpotential than that of the NiFe/Cu NWs (167 mV). It highlights the significance of Mo species for the HER in neutral electrolytes, which was further supported by theoretical calculations (Fig. S12 and Table S1, ESI†). Fig. 2b shows the corresponding Tafel plots, the NiMoFe/Cu NWs possess a low Tafel slope of 57.16 mV dec−1, which is superior to that of Pt/C (94.37 mV dec−1), NiFe/Cu NWs (131.94 mV dec−1) and NiMoFe/CF (201.23 mV dec−1), indicating a fast increase in the hydrogen generation rate.24 Overall, to the best of our knowledge, the NiMoFe/Cu NWs deliver a rather high HER performance, which is superior to that of most of the reported state-of-the-art electrocatalysts in neutral electrolytes (Fig. S13, ESI†).

The catalytic performance of the NiMoFe/Cu NWs for the OER was also evaluated in a 1.0 M PBS aqueous solution. In contrast to the significance of Mo species in the HER, Fe plays an essential role in the OER process. The NiMoFe/Cu NWs exhibit a much lower overpotential (520 mV) and a smaller Tafel slope (148.53 mV dec−1), followed by NiFe/Cu NWs (550 mV, 167.88 mV dec−1) and NiMo/Cu NWs (624 mV, 208.55 mV dec−1), respectively (Fig. 3c and d). We note that the NiMoFe/Cu NWs also exhibit a remarkably superior HER and OER activity than that of NiMoFe and commercial Pt/C or Ir/C supported on bare CF, suggesting the important role of the Cu NWs on catalytic activity. In addition to the superior activity, the NiMoFe/Cu NWs demonstrate a high stability of over 48 h under both HER and OER conditions (Fig. 2e). The morphology and composition of the NiMoFe/Cu NW electrode was well maintained after the HER process (Fig. S14a and S15, ESI†). On the other hand, a significant structural transformation is observed after the OER test, and as shown in Fig. S14b (see the ESI†) more nanostructures appear on the electrode surface. Together with the disappearance of the Ni0 and Fe0 XPS signals, it can be concluded that NiMoFe is in situ transformed into NiMoFe (oxy)hydroxide after the OER. Furthermore, the Mo content is remarkably reduced, due to the dissolution of Mo from the electrode. Compared to those of NiMo, the Ni 2p peaks of NiMoFe after the OER test are positively shifted by around 0.5 eV, indicating the electron structure around the Ni local environment was modified by the Fe incorporation (Fig. S16, ESI†). This change in electron structure may explain the fact that the NiMoFe/Cu NWs present an enhanced intrinsic activity for OER, which is consistent with the theoretical calculations shown in Fig. S17 and Table S2 (see the ESI†).

(d) Polarization curves of the NiMoFe/Cu NWs (red curve) and NiMoFe/CF (cyan curve) for overall water splitting and the three series-connected Si solar cells (blue curve). 
To elucidate the possible origins of such extraordinary performance, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis was first performed (Fig. 2f). All the impedance spectra were fitted with an equivalent circuit model (Fig. S18, ESI†). The NiMoFe/Cu NWs exhibit a much smaller charge transfer resistance (Rct) of 9.46 Ω compared with the NiFe/Cu NWs (15.34 Ω), the NiMo/Cu NWs (26.09 Ω) and NiMoFe/CF (152.7 Ω), indicating facilitated charge transfer kinetics and thus leading to better catalytic performance. The electrochemical double-layer capacitance (Cdl) was measured to investigate the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) (Fig. S19, ESI†). The Cdl values of NiMoFe, NiFe and NiMo on the Cu NW electrode were calculated to be 15.2, 11.8 and 9.8 mF cm−2, respectively, which is much higher than that of NiMoFe on CF (1.3 mF cm−2) (Fig. 2g). This demonstrates that improved exposure of active sites was achieved by the rational design of the 3D NiMoFe/Cu NW core–shell nanoarchitectures.
Compared with the NiMoFe/CF sample, the NiMoFe/Cu NWs also possess a more rapid current density in a large overpotential range. This could be attributed to the unique vertically assembled 3D core–shell nanoarchitectures, which remarkably promote mass transfer during water splitting.25 In this case, we measured the contact angles (CAs) of a droplet of 1.0 M PBS on their surfaces. The CAs are 38.5° and 7.4° for NiMoFe/CF and the NiMoFe/Cu NWs, respectively, indicating the better wettability and faster liquid electrolyte transfer of the NiMoFe/Cu NWs (Fig. 2h). To analyze the size distributions and the dynamics of the release of gas bubbles, the bubble releasing process was recorded at 10 mA cm−2 (Fig. 2i). Clearly, for NiMoFe/CF, the gas bubbles grow to a very large average diameter of ∼469.2 μm with a slow bubble releasing rate. In contrast, gas bubbles with an average diameter of ∼216.1 μm leave the surface of the NiMoFe/Cu NWs easily. The fast release of small bubbles could avoid severe blocking of electrocatalytic active sites during gas generation and thus accelerate mass transfer at high reaction rates.26 These results demonstrate that the high electrocatalytic performance of the NiMoFe/Cu NWs was due to both the high intrinsic activity and fast mass transfer behavior.
Finally, the NiMoFe/Cu NWs were evaluated as bifunctional electrodes for practical overall water splitting in 1.0 M PBS. As expected, the NiMoFe/Cu NW couple only requires a low cell voltage of 1.82 V to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm−2 (Fig. 3a). This voltage is much lower than those of the NiMo/Cu NW couple (1.91 V), the NiFe/Cu NW couple (1.95 V), the NiMoFe/CF couple (2.11 V) and the Pt/C||Ir/C couple (1.97 V), as well as those of recently reported bifunctional electrocatalysts working in neutral conditions (Table S3, ESI†). Additionally, the durability was tested at a constant current density of 50 mA cm−2. As shown in Fig. 3b, the applied voltage stays basically constant during the 48 h durability test, which is also better than many other bifunctional electrodes. The calculated and experimental H2 and O2 production agrees well and the ratio of the hydrogen and oxygen production is close to the theoretical value of 2, suggesting a near − 100% faradaic efficiency (Fig. S20, ESI†). Finally, the capability of the NiMoFe/Cu NW electrode for solar-driven water splitting was investigated, in which three series-connected Si solar cells were applied as the power source (Fig. 3c). The polarization curves of the NiMoFe/Cu NW couple and three series-connected Si solar cells intersected at 8.93 mA cm−2 under simulated 1-sun illumination are shown in Fig. 3d. Therefore, the solar-to-hydrogen efficiency (ηSTH) and electric-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency (ηETH) of this system was calculated to reach 10.99% and 54.1%.27 Such an ηSTH value is impressive and surpasses that of NiMoFe/CF (3.57%) and most of the recent state-of-the-art analogous systems even working in alkaline conditions (Table S4 in the ESI†). These results indicate the feasibility of adopting the NiMoFe/Cu NWs as a promising bifunctional electrocatalyst with high efficiency and durability for overall water splitting in neutral conditions.
In summary, the 3D NiMoFe/Cu NW core–shell architecture could not only provide abundant catalytic sites for water electrolysis, but also remarkably facilitate the mass transport process and electron transfer procedure. When assembled in an overall water electrolyzer, the NiMoFe/Cu NWs can attain a 10 mA cm−2 current under an applied voltage of 1.82 V with good stability up to 48 h, ranking the best as compared to NiMo/Cu NWs, NiFe/Cu NWs, NiMoFe/CF and the Pt/C||Ir/C couple. Moreover, by integrating the water electrolyzer with Si solar cells, the solar-driven water splitting system demonstrated a high ηSTH of 10.99%, which is superior to that of NiMoFe/CF and most water electrolysis cells reported previously even in strong alkaline solutions. This work opens up an avenue for designing cost-effective, highly efficient and durable electrocatalysts for applications in large-scale practical hydrogen technologies.
