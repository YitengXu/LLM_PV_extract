    , Accepted 2nd February 2020First published on 3rd February 2020AbstractThe development of a luminescent material with visualized afterglow plays a crucial role in information security. Herein, a long-lived phosphor, KCaF3:Yb3+,Mn2+, with a visualized photon upconversion (UC) afterglow is presented. The UC emission spectrum consists of a high color purity (∼99.33%) yellow emission band peaking at ∼570 nm, and the UC afterglow signal can be observed by the naked eye in both bright and dark fields even at a high temperature of 200 °C. Moreover, the demonstration background and pigments have little influence on the UC afterglow identification. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations and the up-/down-conversion luminescence characteristics suggest that the UC afterglow originates from the long-lived exchange coupled Yb3+–Mn2+ dimers formed in KCaF3:Yb3+,Mn2+, which is independent of the conventional “afterglow trap”. The random distribution characteristics of Mn2+, and the oxygen ion (O2−) introduced by Yb3+ non-equivalent doping are the key factors for forming the efficient UC emission center in this system. Using the photon UC afterglow phosphor in screen printing ink, a visualized information encoding/decoding prototype suitable for both human and machine fast identification is demonstrated.
1. Introduction
Photon upconversion (UC) luminescent materials have been widely investigated over the past several decades, and they remain a research hotspot due to various important applications, such as solid state lasers, solar cells, bio-imaging, temperature sensing, information security, etc.1–9 Particularly, since the UC luminescence signal with minimum background interference is not only suitable for naked eye fast identification but also for machine high-throughput authentication, the lanthanide UC luminescent materials have already been used in Chinese banknotes.10 However, the conventional Yb3+/Er3+ (or Yb3+/Tm3+) co-doped UC luminescent materials always exhibit static and fixed luminescence, which makes it easy to find an alternative, leading to a poor anti-counterfeiting performance.2–4,11 For this issue, multi-mode UC emission, multi-mode excitation UC emission and time-resolved UC luminescence have been developed.12–18 The multi-mode emission/excitation UC luminescence with good design flexibility can significantly improve the anti-counterfeiting performance, however the multi-mode excitation or emission limited their authentication rate as well. By contrast, the introduction of time-resolved luminescence may be a better alternative because the extra luminescence dimension is introduced by using the same excitation source. Unfortunately, the widely investigated lanthanide doped UC materials possess short-lived lifetimes, ranging from several tens of microseconds to a few milliseconds, thus a tedious decoding process and complex time-gated instruments are generally required for this strategy.16–20 In addition, the lanthanide related time-resolved luminescence is usually not suitable for naked eye observation. Therefore, the development of photon UC luminescent materials with visualized afterglow suitable for naked eye fast observation and machine high-throughput authentication is not only critical for fundamental research but also for practical application.
In this work, a long-lived perovskite phosphor, KCaF3:Yb3+,Mn2+, with significant visualized UC afterglow after removal of the excitation source (980 nm laser) under various demonstration circumstances has been demonstrated. Since the afterglow signal in this case is independent of the conventional “afterglow trap”, no longtime pre-irradiation is required to generate the afterglow signal and it is suitable for both human and machine fast identification. Although the Yb3+/Mn2+ related UC luminescence has been observed in some Yb3+/Mn2+ codoped systems, the focus has been on spectral regulation and room/high temperature UC luminescence, and little attention has been paid to applications due to inefficient UC emission.21–23 Besides, it remains a fundamental challenge to rationally design Yb3+/Mn2+ related UC emission as the excitation of Mn2+ and the emission of Yb3+ have no spectral overlap. Herein, the UC emission intensity of the newly discovered KCaF3:Yb3+,Mn2+ is much stronger than that of most of the Yb3+/Mn2+ related UC systems. The density functional theory (DFT) calculation and the up-/down-conversion luminescence show that the formation of the unique {Yb–O–Mn} unit is the key factor for the efficient Yb3+/Mn2+ UC luminescence in this system. Considering the stable and efficient long-lived UC emission of KCaF3:Yb3+,Mn2+, a data encoding/decoding prototype for information encryption and anti-counterfeiting with a fast authentication rate is proposed. This work not only shows a new type of optical information encoding/decoding strategy but also provides new insights into the design of photon UC afterglow materials.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Materials
The raw materials in this work were Yb2O3 (99.998%), MnCO3 (99.95%), KF (99.9%), CaF2 (99.99%), and NH4HF2 (98%). Yb2O3 was purchased from Alfa Aesar Reagent Company (Shanghai, China), and the other materials were supplied by Aladdin Industrial Corporation (Shanghai, China). All chemicals were used as received without further purification.
2.2. Synthesis of KCaF3:Yb3+,Mn2+ Phosphors
A series of KCaF3:xYb3+,yMn2+ (x = 0, 5%; y = 0–30%) phosphors was synthesized by a high-temperature solid-state reaction method. The raw materials of KF, CaF2, MnCO3, Yb2O3 and NH4HF2 were weighed and mixed thoroughly using an agate mortar in a glove box. Then, the mixture was transferred into an alumina crucible and it was preheated at 200 °C for 2 h followed by sintering at 800 °C for 4 h under N2 gas protection. Finally, the as-prepared phosphors were cooled down to room temperature and reground for further characterization.
2.3. Characterization
The phase purity and crystal structure of the products were characterized using a Philips Model PW1830 X-ray powder diffractometer using Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å). The Rietveld method was employed to perform the structure refinement by the program General Structure Analysis System (GSAS).24 The morphology and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) characterizations were performed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL, 2100F). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed with an XPS microprobe system (Thermo SCIENTIFIC ESCALAB 250Xi). The excitation/emission spectra were recorded using an FLS920 fluorescence spectrophotometer (Edinburgh Instruments Ltd) equipped with a 450 W xenon lamp as the excitation source. The UC emission spectra were recorded using a TRIAX320 fluorescence spectrofluorimeter (Jobin-Yvon Co., France) equipped with an R928 photomultiplier tube, in conjunction with a 980 nm diode laser. The fluorescence decay curves were collected using a Tektronix TDS 3012C Digital phosphor oscillograph upon pulsed laser pumping. The temperature-dependent UC luminescence measurement in the range of 323–573 K was recorded using the same spectrofluorimeter with a TAP-02 high-temperature fluorescence instrument accessory (Tian Jin Orient-KOJI instrument Co., Ltd). The UC fluorescence decay curves with a rising edge were collected using an Edinburgh Instrument FLS980 fluorescence spectrometer equipped with a 980 nm laser diode.
2.4. LED performances
An UC luminescence LED was fabricated based on the commercial 940 nm AlGaAs near infrared emission chip (40 mL × 40 mL, TK0H40IRA) and UC luminescence phosphor KCaF3:Mn2+,Yb3+, and the packing procedure is similar to that of the common phosphor converted white LEDs. The UC emission spectra of the above UC luminescence LED were detected using a FLS920 fluorescence spectrophotometer (Edinburgh Instrument) and a direct current (DC) power system to control the output power of the UC luminescence LED.
2.5. Theoretical calculations
The electronic band structure of the KCaF3 host and the site occupancy conditions of Yb3+ and Mn2+ in KCaF3 were calculated theoretically based on density functional theory (DFT) by using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP).25,26 The exchange correlation potential was approximated by using the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with the PBE functional.27 The plane-wave cutoff energy was 400 eV with a 2 × 3 × 3 Monkhorst–Pack grid, which would be enough for energy convergence. The convergence criterion for the electronic energy was 10−5 eV and the structures were relaxed until the Hellmann–Feynman forces were less than 0.02 eV Å−1.
2.6. Anti-counterfeiting and information encryption preparation
Luminescent inks were obtained by mixing 0.2 g of UC phosphors with 0.6 g of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) screen printing ink. To evaluate the practical application possibility of KCaF3:Yb3+,Mn2+, extra commercial pigments were added into the PVC ink to obtain luminescent ink with various colors. Then, the luminescent inks were printed on bottle caps, cardboard or a picture via screen printing. Meanwhile, binary coded and Morse-coded dot-matrices were also printed with luminescent inks containing commercial UC phosphors (purchased from Shenzhen Ningjingzhiyuan anti-counterfeiting pigment technology co. LTD, China) and the as-prepared KCaF3:Yb3+,Mn2+ phosphor. The UC afterglow could be distinguished under the dynamic excitation of the laser. And the corresponding luminescence images were recorded using a digital camera (Canon, EOS 80D, EF-S 18–200 mm f/3.5–5.6 IS) with an exposure time of 1/30 s.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Phase characterization
The UC afterglow sample KCaF3:Yb3+,Mn2+ was synthesized by a high temperature solid state reaction method. Fig. 1a shows the XRD patterns of the as-prepared KCaF3:5%Yb3+,xMn2+ (x = 5, 15, 30%) and the standard card of KCaF3. It was observed that all the diffraction peaks of the samples match well with JCPDS no. 21-1341 (KCaF3), indicating that pure-phased products with orthorhombic KCaF3 have been obtained. The diffraction peaks gradually shift to a higher degree as the Mn2+ content increases, which can be attributed to the lattice contraction caused by Ca2+ substituted by the smaller Mn2+ (r = 1.00, 0.80 Å for Ca2+, Mn2+, respectively). The TEM image in Fig. S1 (ESI†) further confirmed the phase purity and the successful incorporation of Yb3+/Mn2+ ions into the KCaF3 host lattice. To further examine the crystal structure of the as-synthesized samples, Rietveld structure refinements have been performed using the GSAS program, and the final refinement patterns of KCaF3 and KCaF3:5%Yb3+,5%Mn2+ are provided in Fig. 1b and Fig. S2 (ESI†), respectively. Besides, the refinement parameters are also shown in Table S1 (ESI†). The low R-factors indicate that the refined results are reliable. The refined atomic coordinates, and some selected bond distances and bond angles are summarized in Tables S2–S4 (ESI†). It was confirmed that KCaF3 (Fig. 1c) belongs to a typical orthorhombic perovskite structure with a Pnma space group. This structure is constructed from the corner-sharing CaF6 octahedrons in which the Ca2+ ions are coordinated by six F− ions and the K+ ions are located in the cavity surrounded by eight corner-sharing CaF6 octahedrons. Fig. 1d–f show that the CaF6 octahedrons are bridged with angles of 154.790° and 158.421° in the viewing direction of the b and c axis, respectively, and ∠F–Ca–F in a single CaF6 octahedron deviates from 90°, ranging from 87.18° to 92.82°. The distortion index of the CaF6 octahedron was calculated to be 0.002427 (Table S5, ESI†). The slight torsion would partially relieve the selection rule, which may be beneficial to enhancing the UC emission of Mn2+.28

The electronic structure calculation of KCaF3 was performed according to the crystal structure of KCaF3 (ICSD #153628). As shown in Fig. 1g, KCaF3 has a direct band gap (Eg) of ∼7.188 eV, with the conduction band (CB) minimum and the valence band (VB) maximum both at the Γ point of the Brillouin zone. The composition of the energy bands can be further resolved with the help of the total density of states (TDOS) and partial density of states (PDOS) diagram (Fig. 1h). It can be seen that the top of the VB is dominated by the F p states, mixed with a small amount of Ca p and d states. Meanwhile, the bottom of the CB is mainly composed of Ca d states. Because of this large Eg, KCaF3 could be a good host for coordinating emitters with both ground and excited states within its wide band gap.29 Therefore, the energy levels of Mn2+ and Yb3+ in the KCaF3 host lattice could experience little interference with the valence and conduction bands.
3.2. Room temperature UC luminescence properties
The sample KCaF3:Yb3+,Mn2+ exhibits intense UC emission. Fig. 2a shows the room temperature (RT) UC emission spectra of KCaF3:5%Yb3+,xMn2+ with varying Mn2+ contents (x = 1–30%) upon 980 nm laser excitation. All the samples exhibit a single broad emission band centered at about 570 nm, which is consistent with the Stokes emission of Mn2+, as shown in the inset of Fig. 2a, indicating that the visible UC emission of Mn2+ has been realized in the system. The slight redshift of the UC emission compared to that of the Stokes emission is attributed to the changing of the crystal field environment of Mn2+. With increasing content of Mn2+, the UC emission intensity increases initially and reaches its maximum at x = 10%, and then it gradually decreases upon further increasing Mn2+ concentration due to the concentration quenching effect. Hence, the optimal Mn2+ concentration is 10% in this system. It is worth noting that the Mn2+ UC emission in KCaF3:5%Yb3+,5%Mn2+ possesses a quite high color purity of ∼99.33% (Fig. S3, ESI†). Moreover, such a pure yellow UC emission agrees well with the sensitivity curve of the human eye, which would be beneficial for naked eye direct observation. Furthermore, the UC emission of Mn2+ can also be achieved even upon incoherent light excitation by a 940 nm commercial light emitting diode (LED) (Fig. S4, ESI†), implying the strong intensity and easy achievement of Mn2+ UC emission in KCaF3:Yb3+,Mn2+. Indeed, KCaF3:Yb3+,Mn2+ shows relatively efficient UC of Mn2+ among the reported fluoride hosts until now (Fig. S5b, ESI†). It was also noticed that single-band visible UC emission can be observed in this system even when the doping concentration of Mn2+ is as high as 30%, which is obviously different from those of the earlier reported ABF3:Yb3+,Mn2+ (A = Na, K, Rb, Cs; B = Cd, Zn, Mg) systems in which anomalous NIR UC emissions were observed upon elevated Mn2+ doping concentrations due to Mn2+–Mn2+ aggregation.22 Theoretically, the appearance of the NIR emission would reduce the efficiency of the VIS emission, and the occurrence of the NIR emission of Mn2+ is strongly dependent on the distribution state of Mn2+ ions in the hosts. To make clear the luminescence difference, the distribution states of Mn2+ ions in KCaF3 were calculated based on density functional theory (DFT) with a 2 × 2 × 2 supercell of KCaF3 built for structure optimization. For comparison, a representative isostructural orthorhombic (Pbnm) NaMgF3 supercell was also calculated with the same method, and the XRD patterns and UC emission spectra of NaMgF3:Mn2+,Yb3+ are shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†). When two Ca2+ or Mg2+ ions are replaced with two Mn2+ ions, 15 different substitution models are created (denoted as M1–M15) (see Fig. S7 and S8, ESI†). The Mn1–Mn2 distance and total energy (Et) of the fifteen proposed substitution models are given in Table S6 (ESI†). It was noticed that M10 possesses the lowest total energy, meaning that M10 is more preferable in KCaF3. Nevertheless, in model M10, the atoms Mn1 and Mn2 are not the nearest neighbors and the Mn1–Mn2 distance is about 6.1796 Å. Moreover, there is no obvious regularity between the total energy and the Mn1–Mn2 distance for all the substitution models, suggesting that the Mn2+ ions tend to show a random distribution in KCaF3. However, the calculation results are quite different from those of isostructural NaMgF3:Mn2+. Specifically, the total energies of M1 and M2 are significantly lower than the others, and the total energies of the other models are very close, indicating that the M1 and M2 models are more preferable in NaMgF3. It was also observed that the {Mn–F–Mn} unit is formed in both M1 and M2, and the Mn1–Mn2 distance is ∼3.82 Å, which is much shorter than those of the other models. These facts indicate that Mn2+ ions tend to aggregate in NaMgF3. Therefore, the different distribution states of Mn2+ ions in the two hosts result in the diverse luminescence behavior. Actually, the aggregation of Mn2+ ions enables the appearance of NIR UC emission in NaMgF3:Yb3+,Mn2+ (see Fig. S6b, ESI†). Conversely, the random distribution nature of Mn2+ contributes to the single-band visible emission in the whole concentration range for KCaF3:Yb3+,Mn2+ (Fig. 2a). Based on these results, one can conclude that the random distribution of Mn2+ in KCaF3:Mn2+ is an important reason accounting for the strong visible UC luminescence.

To clarify the UC emission process of Mn2+, the power dependence of the integrated UC emission intensity for KCaF3:5%Yb3+,10%Mn2+ is shown in a double logarithmic plot in Fig. S9 (ESI†). Herein, the slope is 1.90, implying that the UC emission of Mn2+ belongs to a two-photon process.30 This is consistent with the excitation from the ground state 6A1(6S) to the excited state 4T1(4G) of Mn2+ as the energy gap is about 2.43 eV and two 980 nm (1.27 eV) photons are required to achieve the UC process. As is well known, there are mainly two two-photon mechanisms accounting for the Mn2+ UC emission, i.e., cooperative sensitization and ground state absorption/excited state absorption (GSA/ESA) based on exchange-coupled Yb3+–Mn2+ dimers. It is universally recognized that the achievement of cooperative sensitization UC luminescence depends on the crystal structure of the host, and the UC emission of the Eu3+ ion is achieved by the cooperative sensitization mechanism when co-doped with the sensitizer Yb3+.31–33 However, the Eu3+ UC emission cannot be realized in KCaF3:Yb3+,Eu3+ (Fig. S10, ESI†). By contrast, an intense Mn2+ UC emission is observed in the same host (Fig. S10, ESI†). Additionally, a cooperative luminescence emission band of Yb3+ centered at ∼490 nm would usually simultaneously appear in the UC emission spectrum. However, the cooperative luminescence of Yb3+ has not been observed in KCaF3:Yb3+,Mn2+. Furthermore, the occurrence of cooperative sensitization usually needs a relatively high power density of the pump laser, while the UC emission of Mn2+ is observed in this system even when pumped by using 940 nm LED (incoherent light) excitation (Fig. S4, ESI†), indicating that the possibility of the cooperative sensitization mechanism generating Mn2+-UC emission is quite low. Therefore, the cooperative sensitization mechanism for Mn2+ UC emission was ruled out. To further confirm the origin of the UC emission, the excitation and visible-to-near-infrared emission spectra were measured and are displayed in Fig. 2b. In KCaF3:5%Mn2+ and KCaF3:5%Yb3+, the emission bands centered at about 566 and 971 nm originate from the 4T1(4G) → 6A1(6S) transition of Mn2+ and 2F5/2 → 2F7/2 transition of Yb3+, respectively. Meanwhile, the corresponding excitation spectra monitored at 566 and 971 nm can be ascribed to the d–d transitions of Mn2+ and the charge transfer band (CTB) of O2−–Yb3+, respectively.22,34 However, in Yb3+/Mn2+ codoped KCaF3:5%Yb3+,5%Mn2+, under the excitation of 395 nm, apart from the Mn2+ emission at 570 nm, the 971 nm NIR emission band of Yb3+ can also be observed. The excitation spectra monitored at 971 nm display a series of d–d transitions of Mn2+ and the CTB of O2−–Yb3+. These phenomena strongly suggest the occurrence of energy transfer from Mn2+ to Yb3+. Although the Mn2+ ion has no intermediate excited states resonant with Yb3+ and the energy gap between the emission of Mn2+ (∼17668 cm−1) and excitation of Yb3+ (∼10000 cm−1) is large enough (∼7668 cm−1), the NIR emission of Yb3+ is indeed obtained upon indirect excitation of Mn2+, and the Mn2+ UC emission can also be obtained by pumping Yb3+. Meanwhile, the lifetime of Yb3+ can be largely enhanced when indirectly excited by Mn2+ (Fig. 2c). Moreover, the Yb3+ emission (971 nm) excited by 260 nm excitation shows some differences as compared to that by 395 nm excitation (Fig. 2b). All these phenomena observed above firmly demonstrate that Yb3+ and Mn2+ ions may together form some unique luminescence center in KCaF3:Yb3+,Mn2+. Actually, when Yb3+ and Mn2+ are close enough (<5 Å), the unique luminescence center Yb3+–Mn2+ dimer can be formed via super-exchange interaction by sharing an interval anion, and the unique emission center can be achieved in manganese bromides, chloride hosts and fluorides ABF3 (A = Na, K, Rb,Cs, B = Mg, Zn, Cd).21,22 For the KCaF3:5%Yb3+,5%Mn2+ sample, the average distance between Yb3+ and Mn2+ can be roughly determined by the formula:35 (1)where V is the volume of the unit cell, x is the total concentration of Yb3+ and Mn2+, and N is the number of molecules in the unit cell. In this case, V = 331 Å3, x = 0.10, and N = 4. Based on eqn (1), the average distance between Yb3+ and Mn2+ is calculated to be ∼11.65 Å, which is much larger than the critical value (5 Å) required for the formation of Yb3+–Mn2+ dimers, thus it is difficult to form the Yb3+–Mn2+ UC emission center in the system. Nevertheless, an intense yellow UC emission of Mn2+ is obtained, which suggests that the Yb3+ and Mn2+ ions may tend to aggregate in the host KCaF3. According to the crystal structure of KCaF3 shown in Fig. 1c, the minimum distance between Yb3+ and Mn2+ is about 4.36 Å, indicating the possibility of forming corner-sharing Yb3+–Mn2+ dimers. To further evaluate the possibility of the aggregation of Yb3+ and Mn2+ ions, first principles calculations based on DFT for KCaF3:Yb3+,Mn2+ were performed. Firstly, the formation energies of all the possible configurations of Ca2+ substituted by Yb3+ were calculated. The formation energy (Ef) is calculated by:36 Ef = E(doped) − E(perfect) − ∑niμi(2)where E(doped) and E(perfect) are the total energy of the doped and perfect crystal, respectively. μi is the chemical potential and ni is the number of the added (ni > 0) or removed (ni < 0) i-type atoms. There are three kinds of occupation configurations: (i) Yb3+ substitutes for Ca2+ and a K+ vacancy is formed for charge compensation (); (ii) two Yb3+ ions substitute for two Ca2+ with a Ca2+ vacancy for charge compensation (); (iii) Yb3+ substitutes for Ca2+ with a coordination ion F− replaced by O2− for charge compensation (). The introduction of O2− in the third configuration is proposed based on the existence of the O2−–Yb3+ CTB in the system, as shown in Fig. 2b, and the TEM and XPS results shown in Fig. S1 and S11 (ESI†), respectively. Actually, O element contamination is inevitable in fluorides synthesized by the high temperature solid state method.37 There are 2, 3 and 6 different substitution models for configurations i, ii, and iii, respectively. As shown in Table S7 (ESI†), the formation energies of the third configuration () are much lower than those of the other two configurations, indicating that the O contamination may be beneficial for the higher doping concentration of the Yb3+ ion. Secondly, based on the model  that possesses the lowest formation energy, an additional Mn2+ ion is introduced into the system via substitution for Ca2+. There are 3 possible substitution models for the K4Ca2YbMnOF11 cell (named M1 to M3, respectively) (Fig. S12, ESI†). The M1 model (Fig. 2e) characterized by the Mn2+ ion substituting for the Ca2+ site in which Mn2+ is bridged with Yb3+ by sharing O2− has a lower formation energy than the other models (Fig. S12, ESI†). The results suggest that the doped Yb3+ and Mn2+ ions tend to stay together through sharing an O2− ion to achieve the lowest systematic formation energy in the KCaF3 host, indicating the aggregation of Yb3+ and Mn2+ ions. Additionally, the smaller electronegativity of O (3.5) compared with that of F (4.0) may make the Yb/Mn–O bonds possess more covalent bond composition than Yb/Mn–F bonds,38 which is beneficial for the super-exchange interaction between Yb3+ and Mn2+ ions. The stronger exchange interaction would result in the stronger UC emission of Yb3+–Mn2+ dimers.21 Therefore, the formation of the {Yb–O–Mn} configuration may be an indispensable reason accounting for the achievement of intense Mn2+ UC emission in this system. The Mn2+ UC emission spectra of the other ABF3 samples and the corresponding excitation/emission spectra were measured for comparison (Fig. S5, ESI†). It was noticed that the samples (KCdF3/RbCdF3/RbCaF3/KCaF3:Yb3+,Mn2+) that show a Mn–O or Yb–O CT in the excitation spectra tend to possess greater UC emission intensity, which further confirms the importance of Yb/Mn–O bonds in achieving intense UC emission of Mn2+. The formation of the {Yb–O–Mn} configuration proposed by this paper provides a new prospective pathway to design new systems that are able to obtain intense Yb3+/Mn2+ related UC emission. Based on the above DFT calculations and the experimental evidence, it is convincing that the unique luminescence center Yb3+–Mn2+ dimer is formed in the KCaF3:Yb3+,Mn2+ system. In addition, the GSA/ESA UC mechanism based on the exchange coupled Yb3+–Mn2+ dimers can be utilized to interpret the Mn2+ UC emission.
To get more information about the UC emission of Mn2+, the UC luminescence dynamics of Mn2+ was also studied by measuring the concentration-dependent UC decay curves, as shown in Fig. 2d. The luminescence decay curves can be well fitted to a double-exponential decay equation: I(t) = A1exp(−t/τ1) + A2exp(−t/τ2) + I0(3)where I(t) and I0 represent the emission intensities at time t and 0, A1 and A2 are constants, t is the time, and τ1 and τ2 represent the rapid and slow decay exponents, respectively. The average UC lifetime (τ) values are presented in Table S8 (ESI†), which were calculated by the following equation: τ = (A1τ12 + A2τ22)/(A1τ1 + A2τ2)(4)
The UC lifetime shows a trend of initial increase followed by a decease as the Mn2+ content increases, and it reaches the maximum of 40.31 ms at a concentration of x = 5%. The initial increase may be attributed to the small possibility of a nonradiative transition among the UC luminescence centers (Yb3+–Mn2+ dimers) and the less energy transfer to Mn2+ (or Yb3+) or the defects due to the large distance resulting from the low Mn2+ doping concentration. It is worth noting that a long rising edge (∼2.4 ms) before the decay of the UC emission of Mn2+ is clearly detected, as shown in the inset of Fig. 2d, which indicates that the energy transfer process also contributes to the UC emission of Mn2+. Since there inevitably exist isolated Yb3+ ions around the UC luminescence center, the rising edge is ascribed to the energy transfer from isolated Yb3+ to super-exchange coupled Yb3+–Mn2+ dimers.23 Furthermore, the long-lived UC emission of Mn2+ together with its strong emission intensity may endow the KCaF3:Yb3+,Mn2+ phosphor with great potential in visualized lifetime-encoded information encryption, anti-counterfeiting, etc.
Based on the analysis above, an UC emission mechanism diagram was proposed, as shown in Fig. 2f. Upon absorption of the first 980 nm photon, the dimer is excited from the |2F7/2,6A1(6S)〉 ground state to the |2F5/2,6A1(6S)〉 intermediate excited state (GSA process), which is essentially located on the Yb3+ ion. Then, the dimer is further promoted from the |2F5/2,6A1(6S)〉 state to the |2F7/2,4T1(4G)〉 emitting state by absorbing another 980 nm photon, noted as the ESA process. Meanwhile, the |2F7/2,4T1(4G)〉 emitting state can also be populated by an ETU process from an excited isolated Yb3+ ion, and then it emits a visible photon. The detailed GSA/ESA and GSA/ETU processes for the UC luminescence are expressed as follows:|2F7/2,6A1(6S)〉 + hν (980 nm) → |2F5/2,6A1(6S)〉 (GSA)|2F5/2,6A1(6S)〉 + hν (980 nm) → |2F7/2,4T1(4G)〉 (ESA)2F5/2 + |2F5/2,6A1(6S)〉 → 2F7/2 + |2F7/2,4T1(4G)〉 (ETU)|2F7/2,4T1(4G)〉 → |2F7/2,6A1(6S)〉 + hν (∼570 nm)
The typical characteristic for all UC materials is the existence of a long-lived intermediate state that serves as an energy storage reservoir for the pump energy.39 Notably, the lifetime of the intermediate state |2F5/2,6A1(6S)〉 for the unique luminescence center Yb3+–Mn2+ dimer is measured to be 23.09 ms by 395 nm excitation (for the sample KCaF3:5%Yb3+,5%Mn2+). Such a long-lived lifetime may help to achieve an easier and higher population of the emitting state |2F7/2,4T1(4G)〉. Consequently, the existence of the ultra-long-lived intermediate state |2F5/2,6A1(6S)〉 may be another reason that contributes to the intense RT UC emission in the KCaF3:Yb3+,Mn2+ system.
3.3. High temperature UC luminescence properties
It is well known that the luminescence efficiencies of luminescent materials are strongly dependent on temperature, and usually a higher temperature would lead to a lower luminescence efficiency owing to the serious nonradiative loss as the temperature increases. Hence, it is critical to investigate the temperature-dependent UC emission properties of the KCaF3:Yb3+,Mn2+ system above RT. Fig. 3a and b presents the temperature-dependent UC emission spectra of the as-synthesized KCaF3:5%Yb3+,10%Mn2+ in the temperature range of RT-573 K upon 980 nm laser excitation. As the temperature increases, the UC emission peak position undergoes a slight blue-shift, which is ascribed to the decreased crystal field strength resulting from the heat induced host lattice expansion. In addition, the integrated UC emission intensity decreases monotonously with increasing temperature (inset in Fig. 3a). Such a thermal quenching behavior is also observed in other Yb3+/Mn2+ co-doped UC systems and is mainly attributed to the nonradiative transition from the |2F7/2,4T1(4G)〉 state to the |2F5/2,6A1(6S)〉 state. As shown in Fig. 3a, when the temperature rises to 373, 473 and 573 K, the UC emission intensity is found to be about 85%, 45% and 23% of the value at RT, respectively, exhibiting a good anti-thermal quenching behavior. Fig. 4c demonstrates the variation of the UC emission intensity of KCaF3:5%Yb3+,10%Mn2+ at RT–473 K for 8 cycles. After 8 cycles, the ultimate UC intensity of KCaF3:5%Yb3+,10%Mn2+ is found to be 108% of the initial value, exhibiting superior luminescence reversibility. Such good anti-thermal quenching properties of Mn2+ UC emission are scarcely observed in other hosts, and are even much better than those of the RbCaF3:Yb3+,Mn2+ system (Fig. S13, ESI†), which may be ascribed to the stronger structural rigidity of KCaF3 compared with RbCaF3.21,23,40 In addition to the emission intensity, the UC emission lifetimes of Mn2+ at various temperatures were also measured (see Fig. 3d). The UC emission decay curves follow a double-exponential decay rule in the whole temperature range. Although the UC lifetime decreases gradually with the rising temperature, the lifetime value remains a relatively high value of 18.04 and 15.38 ms as the temperature reaches 473 and 573 K, respectively. Therefore, the yellow afterglow of the Mn2+ UC emission can be observed by the naked eye even at a high temperature of 473 K (Fig. S14, ESI†), and the slight deviation of the emission color could be negligible to the naked eye. These facts demonstrate that the KCaF3:Yb3+,Mn2+ phosphor may also find application in visualized lifetime-encoded anti-counterfeiting and information security at elevated temperatures.

3.4. Information security application
Considering the unique UC luminescence properties and excellent thermal stability, the as-synthesized KCaF3:Yb3+,Mn2+ phosphor can be used as a new class of optical materials for information encryption, encoding, advanced anti-counterfeiting, etc. As a proof of concept, simple demonstrations were performed based on the as-synthesized KCaF3:5%Yb3+,10%Mn2+. First of all, the application value of the KCaF3:Yb3+,Mn2+ phosphor was evaluated. On the one hand, as shown in Fig. 4a, KCaF3:Yb3+,Mn2+ luminescent ink was printed on bottle caps made of different materials. When the 980 nm laser excites the rotating bottle caps, yellow afterglow can be seen by the naked eye on all the caps. That is, material textures of the substrate surfaces have little influence on the long-lived UC luminescence characters. On the other hand, the influence of commercial pigments was also evaluated. As shown in Fig. 4b, KCaF3:Yb3+,Mn2+ luminescent ink was printed on a piece of cardboard (Fig. 4b-i). In contrast, extra commercial pigments were added into the KCaF3:Yb3+,Mn2+ luminescent ink and the corresponding inks were also printed on cardboard (Fig. 4b-ii–v). Under dynamic excitation of the 980 nm laser, an obvious yellow afterglow was observed on all the samples of cardboard, while this cannot be achieved with commercial UC phosphors due to the short-lived emission of lanthanide ions (Fig. 4c and Fig. S15, ESI†). Although the commercial pigments show absorption of the UC emission of KCaF3:5%Yb3+,10%Mn2+, especially the red pigment, they have little influence on the lifetime of the UC emission (Fig. S16, ESI†). Therefore, the KCaF3:Yb3+,Mn2+ phosphor can be utilized in information encryption, anti-counterfeiting, etc, on various kinds of substrates by mixing with commercial pigments, which can greatly improve its concealment and applicable universality. Moreover, the apparent yellow afterglow under daylight can be observed even upon dynamic irradiation of a commercial 980 nm laser pen with a maximum power of 0.1 W that is safe for human eyes (Fig. S17, ESI†). All the above facts fully prove the high possibility for practical applications of the as-prepared KCaF3:Yb3+,Mn2+ phosphor.
Then, a more vivid demonstration was performed using a picture of a school badge; as shown in Fig. 5a, a two-dimensional code of the school was printed on the school badge using the luminescent ink consisting of the KCaF3:Yb3+,Mn2+ phosphor. It is difficult to recognize the colorless ink on the badge by the naked eye under daylight (Fig. 5a-i). Upon static 980 nm laser excitation, a yellow two-dimensional code was observed (Fig. 5a-ii). When moving the 980 nm laser, an intense long yellow afterglow was observed despite the complex background of the badge (Fig. 5a-iii). The long yellow afterglow ensures that the decoding process is fast and efficient, which cannot be achieved with the traditional persistent phosphors because the afterglow time is extremely long such that it interferes with the next authentication (Fig. S18, ESI†). Furthermore, circle patterns according to the binary codes of the standard 8 bit ASCII characters were also printed, as shown in Fig. 5b. The designed red and blue circles were printed with luminescent inks with and without the prepared KCaF3:Yb3+,Mn2+ phosphor, respectively. All circles exhibited bright fluorescent signals upon 980 nm laser excitation and could then be translated into invalid information according to the ASCII binary code. However, when moving the 980 nm laser away, the red circles printed with luminescent inks containing KCaF3:Yb3+,Mn2+ phosphor exhibit a yellow afterglow due to the long-lived emission of Mn2+. Correspondingly, the four raw dot-matrices can be easily read and translated into “01010011”, “01000011”, “01010101” and “01010100”, corresponding to the capital letters “S”, “C”, “U” and “T” according to the ASCII binary code. Owing to the remarkable long-lived UC luminescence property of Mn2+, the security of this binary coding system has been significantly improved to avoid information leakage. As a security information coding standard, Morse code has been used as a communication system to transmit text including letters, numbers and symbols worldwide. Herein, Morse code is also used, as shown in Fig. 5c. The inks with and without KCaF3:Yb3+,Mn2+ phosphor represent “dashes” and “dots”, respectively. Similar to the ASCII codes shown in Fig. 5b, upon moving the 980 nm laser, the hidden information can be decrypted into “SCUT” according to the rules of Morse code. Thanks to the long-lived emission of the UC of Mn2+, various complicated UC fluorescent systems can be designed, which greatly enhances the information security level and the decrypting efficiency. Notably, in the binary coded and Morse-coded dot-matrices, the ink patterns are isolated circles or short lines, which are not as consecutive in shape as that in Fig. 4. As a result, the long-lived yellow circles are not as visually as the long yellow tail shown in Fig. 4. Besides, for a dot matrix with a length of 2 cm, the encoded information can only be readout with a moving speed greater than ∼8.10 cm s−1 (Fig. S19, ESI†). These facts mean that a more secure way of information encryption is achieved, and only well-trained and authorized individuals who know the correct decoding rule and the decay lifetimes are able to access the confidential information.

Power density: ∼13.41 W cm−2; moving speed of 980 nm LD: ∼13.65 cm s−1. The scale bar is 5 mm. 
4. Conclusion
In summary, a perovskite fluoride UC luminescent material, KCaF3:Yb3+,Mn2+, with an efficient long-lived emission (∼emission lifetime of 40 ms) peaking at ∼570 nm has been demonstrated. Upon moving the 980 nm laser or the material, intense yellow afterglow can be easily observed by the naked eye in various demonstration environments. The DFT calculations show that the random distribution nature of Mn2+ ions in the host lattice, the formation of the {Yb–O–Mn} configuration and the existence of the ultra-long-lived intermediate state |2F5/2,6A1(6S)〉 are the three indispensable reasons accounting for the achievement of intense Mn2+ UC emission in this system. Moreover, the KCaF3:Yb3+,Mn2+ phosphor possesses excellent thermal stability and the UC afterglow of this phosphor can be observed even at a high temperature of 473 K. Furthermore, both the material textures of the substrate surfaces and the commercial pigments have little influence on the UC afterglow characters, showing high potential for practical application. Thanks to the unique emission properties, a data visualized encoding/decoding strategy for information encryption and anti-counterfeiting with a fast authentication rate has been demonstrated. This work not only provides a new information encryption and anti-counterfeiting technology, but also offers new insights into the photon UC emission.
