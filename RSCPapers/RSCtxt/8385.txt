The introduction of an ultrathin PEIE interlayer can markedly reduce the anodic resistance of inverted devices, mostly because the ultrathin PEIE interlayer can separate MoO3 from Ag, thereby suppressing the reduction of MoO3 by gaseous Ag to lower-oxidation state Mo species which decrease the work function of MoO3 and are then detrimental to hole extraction from the photoactive layer. In addition, the PEIE interlayer can act as an optical spacer to optimize the optical absorption of inverted devices.

Introduction
During the past decade, solution-processed organic solar cells (OSCs) have achieved enormous progress, such as syntheses of donor and acceptor materials,1–6 morphology control of bulk-heterojunction blend thin films,7,8 optimization of device structures and optical absorption,9,10 design of ternary photoactive layers,11–17, development of tandem architectures,18,19etc. As a result, the best power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of OSCs have steadily reached 12–14% (ref. 19–21) comparable to those of amorphous Si:H solar cells. Prospective improvements in the PCEs of OSCs may rely on the delicate design of the device structure, allowing for simultaneous optimizations of the electrical and optical losses.
In order to enhance the selective electron extraction from the electron acceptor, e.g., [6,6]-phenyl C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM, Fig. 1), of the photoactive layer into the cathode, a wide variety of cathode-modifying materials have been developed, for example, ZnO,22 TiO2,10 PFN,23 polyethylenimine ethoxylated (PEIE),24 chemically modified fullerene,25 chemically modified ZnO,26 bathocuproine,27etc. Likewise, selective hole extraction from the electron donor, e.g., [[2,6′-4,8-di(5-ethylhexylthienyl)benzo[1,2-b;3,3-b]dithiophene] [3-fluoro-2[(2-ethylhexyl)carbonyl]thieno[3,4-b]thiophenediyl]] (PTB7-Th, Fig. 1)28 of the photoactive layer into the anode needs to be improved at the same time. Only a limited number of anode-modifying materials with high work functions, such as poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS), NiO and MoO3,29–31 have been developed to build ohmic contacts between the commonly used anodes (e.g., Ag, Al, and ITO) with middle work functions of around 4.3 eV and electron donors with highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs) of around −5.2 to −5.4 eV.
 Fig. 1  The molecular structures of PTB7-Th and PC71BM. 
The cathode-modifying and anode-modifying layers also play important roles in adjusting the spatial distribution of the incident light intensity across photovoltaic devices. For example, the TiOx layer can act as an electron-collecting optical spacer to enhance the optical absorption of the photoactive layer and thereby the PCE of the device;10 inverted OSCs based on PFN afford improved performance compared to their ZnO counterpart,23 mostly because the PFN layer enables inverted devices to harvest more photons than the ZnO layer in addition to the interfacial dipole effect.
A desirable hole extraction layer should decrease the electrical loss so as to achieve efficient charge extraction, and decrease the optical loss so as to ensure a high short-circuit current density (JSC). A combination of MoO3 and Ag has been recognized as the most efficient structure to extract holes in inverted OSCs. It is worth searching for novel hole extraction layers in an attempt to improve the hole extraction based on Ag and MoO3. PEIE is a classical cathode-modifying material. Here, we report the first example of using PEIE as an anode-modifying material. We use MoO3/PEIE/Ag as the hole extraction layer to enhance the performance of inverted OSCs. The introduction of an ultrathin PEIE interlayer (5 nm) can markedly reduce the anodic resistance of the device, mostly because PEIE can separate MoO3 from Ag, thereby suppressing the formation of lower-oxidation state Mo species which decrease the work function of MoO3 and then are detrimental to hole extraction. In addition, PEIE can act as an optical spacer to optimize the optical absorption of the device. As a result, the novel hole extraction structure of MoO3/PEIE/Ag increases the device efficiency by a factor of 16% relative to that of the conventional MoO3/Ag in inverted OSCs.
Results and discussion
Inverted OSCs with ITO/PEIE/PTB7-Th:PC71BM/MoO3/Ag and ITO/PEIE/PTB7-Th:PC71BM/MoO3/PEIE 5 nm/Ag structures were fabricated. Fig. 2(a) shows the dependence of the PCE on the MoO3 thickness in the two types of inverted OSC. The device with MoO3/Ag displays its highest PCE of 7.95% at MoO3 thickness = 11.5 nm, and lowest PCE of about 7.24% at MoO3 thickness = 7 and 8.5 nm. The device with MoO3/PEIE 5 nm/Ag displays its highest PCE of 8.42% at MoO3 thickness = 8.5 nm and lowest PCE of 7.92% at MoO3 thickness = 10 nm. At a given thickness of MoO3, the hole extraction structure of MoO3/PEIE 5 nm/Ag yields a higher PCE than the conventional MoO3/Ag.

As seen in Fig. 2(b), the VOC of the device with the MoO3/PEIE 5 nm/Ag composite anode is insensitive to the MoO3 thickness (∼0.80 V), while that of the MoO3/Ag composite anode shows dependence on the MoO3 thickness. At a given MoO3 thickness, MoO3/PEIE 5 nm/Ag yields a higher VOC than MoO3/Ag. As shown in Fig. 2(c), the device using the MoO3/PEIE 5 nm/Ag composite anode displays a higher JSC relative to that using the MoO3/Ag composite anode when the MoO3 thickness is between 7 and 10 nm. The highest JSC of 15.58 mA cm−2 is achieved at MoO3 thickness = 8.5 nm for MoO3/PEIE 5 nm/Ag, higher than that (15.42 mA cm−2) achieved with MoO3 thickness = 4 nm for MoO3/Ag. The MoO3/PEIE 5 nm/Ag composite anode improved the fill factor (FF) of the device compared to the MoO3/Ag composite anode (Fig. 2(d)). The current density versus voltage (J–V) characteristics and detailed photovoltaic parameters of these inverted OSCs are listed in Fig. S1 and Table S1.†
As shown in Fig. 3, the hole-only device using the MoO3/PEIE 5 nm/Ag composite anode yields higher current densities than that using the MoO3/Ag composite anode at MoO3 thickness = 5.5, 8.5, and 11.5 nm. For example, at a driving voltage of 1.5 V, the current densities of the devices using the MoO3/PEIE 5 nm/Ag composite anode are 166, 178, and 162 mA cm−2 at MoO3 thickness = 5.5, 8.5, and 11.5 nm, respectively, which are higher than those (131, 157, and 146 mA cm−2) of the devices using the MoO3/Ag composite anodes. This clearly demonstrates that the inclusion of PEIE 5 nm between MoO3 and Ag can reduce the electrical loss in the hole injection process, coincident with the observation that the device with MoO3/PEIE 5 nm/Ag displays decreased series resistance (RS) and increased FF, relative to that with MoO3/Ag, at a given thickness of MoO3 (Table S1†).

In general, the MoO3 is unlikely to be reduced by solid Ag at room temperature, since the free energy () for the reaction of 2Ag(s) + MoO3(s) → Ag2O(s) + MoO2(s) is calculated to be 126.6 kJ mol−1 based on Table 1. However, the reaction of 2Ag(g) + MoO3(s) → Ag2O(s) + MoO2(s) can happen spontaneously, due to its calculated  of −374.2 kJ mol−1. Therefore, upon the deposition of gaseous Ag on MoO3, the lower-oxidation state Mo species like MoO2 and Mo can be formed even at the photoactive layer/MoO3 interface, due to the thermal diffusion of Ag, consistent with the X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) observations in Fig. 4. The lower-oxidation state Mo species display smaller values of work function than MoO3,32 thereby hindering hole extraction from the photoactive layer. If a thin interlayer of PEIE is coated on MoO3, the gaseous Ag is separated from MoO3, suppressing the reduction of MoO3 and thereby diminishing the contact resistance between the photoactive layer and MoO3. As seen in Fig. S2,† when the PEIE thickness is between 5 and 10 nm, the hole-only devices with MoO3/PEIE/Ag show higher current densities than that with MoO3/Ag at a given driving voltage, indicating that the ultrathin PEIE interlayer does not cause appreciable electrical loss to the hole current conduction. As shown in Fig. S3,† the work functions of MoO3 and PEIE-coated MoO3 are measured to be 5.11 and 4.40 eV, respectively, which is consistent with the observation that PEIE is able to reduce the work function of its underlying layer.24 Note that the measured work function of our air-exposed MoO3 is less than that of freshly evaporated MoO3 (6.90 eV).34Fig. 5 shows the energy levels of the MoO3/PEIE/Ag combination. The work function of MoO3 is considered to be 0.2 eV below its CB level.34 The interfacial dipoles (Δ1 and Δ2) are calculated to be −0.71 and −0.10 eV, respectively. Therefore, it can be concluded that the MoO3/PEIE matches the Fermi level of Ag. As shown in Fig. 6, the MoO3/PEIE/Ag composite anode increases the internal quantum efficiency (IQE) and external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the inverted device in the range from 400 to 700 nm relative to the MoO3/Ag composite anode, indicating that the mediation of PEIE in the anodic contact improves the charge extraction of the inverted device.

Fig. 7 displays the cross-section field profiles of transverse magnetic (TM) polarized light at three typical wavelengths for the inverted devices with and without PEIE between MoO3 and Ag. The inclusion of PEIE as optical spacer between MoO3 and Ag can optimize the optical field distribution of incident light within the PTB7-Th:PC71BM active layer, indicating that the absorption of the incident light energy would be enhanced in the inverted device with the MoO3 8.5 nm/PEIE/Ag, compared to the one with the MoO3 8.5 nm/Ag. Due to the decreases in the optical and resistive losses caused by the PEIE interlayer between MoO3 and Ag, PCE is enhanced by a factor of 16% (Table S1†).

Conclusions
PEIE is typically a cathode-modifying material. We report a novel hole extraction structure of MoO3/PEIE/Ag using PEIE as an anode-modifying material, which can decrease both the electrical and optical loss, and increase the efficiency of OSCs, relative to conventional MoO3/Ag. The ultrathin PEIE interlayer can effectively reduce the anodic resistance by preventing the reduction of MoO3 to lower-oxidation state Mo species like MoO2 and Mo, thereby improving the charge extraction and FF of the inverted device. PEIE is also able to increase the optical absorption of the device, thereby contributing to the increase in the JSC of the inverted device. Thus, MoO3/PEIE/Ag increases the device efficiency by a factor of 16% relative to the conventional MoO3/Ag.
Experimental section
Materials
The PTB7-Th and PC71BM were obtained from 1-material Inc. and American Dye Source Inc., respectively. The PEIE (80% ethoxylated, Mw ∼ 110000 g mol−1, and 37 wt% in water) and MoO3 (99.5%) were bought from Sigma-Aldrich. All of the materials were used as received. The ITO-coated glass substrates (sheet resistance = 15 Ω per square) were cleaned stepwise in detergent, water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol in a ultrasonic bath for 30 min each and subsequently dried in an oven at 150 °C for 15 min.
Device fabrication and measurements
The procedure for fabricating the reference inverted OSCs of ITO/PEIE/PTB7-Th:PC71BM/MoO3/Ag is as follows. ca. 5 nm PEIE thin film was spin-coated onto the ITO cathode from a 2-methoxyethanol solution containing 0.2 wt% PEIE at a speed of 5000 rpm. The PTB7-Th:PC71BM thin films were spin-cast onto the PEIE for 60 s at a speed of 1000 rpm from a mixed solvent chlorobenzene/1,8-diiodoctane (97:3 by volume) solution containing 10 mg ml−1 PTB7-Th and 15 mg ml−1 PC71BM. The thickness of the photoactive layer was measured to be ca. 120 nm. The photoactive layers were dried under vacuum for one hour. Then, a layer of MoO3 and a 80 nm layer of Ag were sequentially evaporated under high vacuum (ca. 10−5 Pa) through a shadow mask to define the active area of the solar cell (2 × 2 mm2) and form a composite anode.
To fabricate inverted OSCs of ITO/PEIE/PTB7-Th:PC71BM/MoO3/PEIE/Ag, the procedure was the same as that mentioned above, except that the PEIE thin films with various thicknesses mediating between the MoO3 and Ag were spin-coated onto the MoO3 layer from a 2-methoxyethanol solution containing PEIE at a speed of 5000 rpm. Hole-only devices were fabricated with a ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PTB7-Th:PC71BM/AC architecture, where AC = MoO3/Ag or MoO3/PEIE/Ag. ca. 30 nm PEDOT:PSS (Baytron PVP AI 4083, Germany) was spin-coated onto the ITO glass at a speed of 4000 rpm and then baked at 150 °C for 15 min in air.
The photovoltaic parameters of the devices were obtained from J–V measurements using a programmable Agilent B2912A sourcemeter under a 1 sun, AM 1.5G spectrum from an XES-70S1 solar simulator (AAA grade, 70 × 70 mm2 photobeam size). The film thicknesses were measured using a Bruker DektakXT stylus profiling system. The EQE and reflectance spectra of the inverted devices were obtained using a Solar Cell Spectral Response Measurement System QE-R3011 (Enlitech Co., Ltd.), based on which the IQE spectra of the inverted devices were calculated. The XPS measurements were carried out on an imaging photoelectron spectrometer (Axis Ultra). Typically, the hydrocarbon C1s line at 284.8 eV from adventitious carbon was used for the energy reference. The work functions of the samples were measured via ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS, ESCALab250Xi multi-functional photoelectron spectrometer).
The electric field intensity distributions in the inverted OSCs were simulated based on rigorous electromagnetic theory through the FDTD method (Lumerical FDTD Solutions 8.17.1157) together with in-house generated codes, which were conducted with polarized incident light, using perfectly matched boundary conditions in all dimensions. In the device optical modelling, the frequency dependent refractive index (n) and extinction coefficient (k) of ITO, PEIE, PTB7-Th:PC71BM and MoO3 were experimentally determined by an ellipsometer (J.A. Woollam Co., Inc), and the complex refractive indices of the Ag back electrode used in this work are n = 0.132 + i2.72, n = 0.129 + i3.25, and n = 0.131 + i3.88, respectively, for the incident light at the three typical wavelengths of 480, 520, and 620 nm.

MoO2(s)/MoO3(s)	MoO2(s) + 1/2O2(g) → MoO3(s)	−137.8
Ag(s)/Ag2O(s)	2Ag(s) + 1/2O2(g) → Ag2O(s)	−11.2
Ag(s)/Ag(g)	Ag(s) → Ag(g)	250.4

 	Fig. 4  XPS spectra of the Mo 3d core level for the air surfaces of the glass/MoO3 10 nm (black line) and glass/MoO3 10 nm/Ag 5 nm (red line). For the glass/MoO3 10 nm/Ag 5 nm, there is a prominent peak ranging from 224 to 230 eV, characteristic of lower-oxidation state Mo species like MoO2 and Mo.33	 

 	Fig. 5  The energy levels of the MoO3/PEIE/Ag composite anode. CB, VB, EF, and Evac stand for conduction band, valence band, Fermi level, and vacuum level, respectively. The energy levels of PEIE are unknown and therefore not shown. The band bending at the interfaces is neglected for simplicity.34	 

 	Fig. 6  The IQE (a) and EQE (b) spectra of the inverted devices of ITO/PEIE/PTB7-Th:PC71BM/MoO3 5.5 nm/Ag and ITO/PEIE/PTB7-Th:PC71BM/MoO3 5.5 nm/PEIE 5 nm/Ag.	 

 	Fig. 7  The normalized cross-sectional near-field profiles of TM polarized light for normal-incidence monochromatic illumination at wavelengths of 480, 520, and 620 nm for inverted OSCs with a ITO/PEIE/PTB7-Th:PC71BM/AC structure, where AC = MoO3 8.5 nm/Ag (left) or MoO3 8.5 nm/PEIE 5 nm/Ag (right).
