    , Accepted 5th August 2020First published on 6th August 2020AbstractSurface oxidation frequently occurs in non-oxide antimony chalcogenides, which is a double-edged sword for their (opto)electronic properties and applications. Here we report that the photoelectronic performance of Sb2Se3 nanorods (NRs) can be improved through an appropriate degree of surface oxidation. During the synthesis, the volume ratio of oleic acid (OA)/oleylamine (OLA) was varied to control the oxidation degrees of the Sb2Se3 NRs, which span 1.20–51.49% with increasing OA ratio as revealed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis. A medium level of surface oxidation, typically 20–30% found here, is beneficial to the enhancement of the photocurrent, on/off ratios and photostability of the Sb2Se3 NRs when evaluated in a sandwich-type ITO/Sb2Se3/ITO photoconductor device. Surface hydroxylation, which is boosted by the presence of Sb–oleate and trace H2O remaining in the reaction system, is suggested to facilitate the formation of Sb–OH bonds and the OA-volume dependent oxidation at the surface of Sb2Se3.
1. Introduction
The optical, electronic and optoelectronic properties of non-oxide semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs) are highly sensitive to their surface chemistry and defects.1–6 Surface defects, such as dangling bonds, vacancies, interstitials, and impurity atoms, frequently give rise to deep-level midgap states, which are thought to localize/trap photoexcited charge carriers and cause significant degradation of the charge carrier mobility (photoconductivity),2,3 power conversion efficiency (PCE),6 or photoluminescence quantum yield (PLYQ)4,6,7 of NCs for optical and photoelectronic devices. Consequently, the passivation and removal of surface defects of NCs by surface chemistry and ligand engineering is a research topic of much importance.1–7 An oxygen atom or molecule can act as one of the shortest ligands to bind with surface metal ions (M–O bonds), inducing surface oxidation or oxygen chemisorption, and is able to remove surface defects (i.e., dangling bonds and vacancies) and the corresponding trap states, which thus enhances the PL or optoelectronic performance of semiconductor NCs.7–9
As V2–VI3 group chalcogenide crystals, Sb2Se3 and Sb2S3 are attractive absorber materials with narrow bandgaps (bulk Eg = ∼1.1 and 1.7 eV, respectively) and high absorption coefficients for various visible-near infrared optoelectronic applications.10–15 They easily suffer from surface oxidation or even the formation of Sb2O3 overgrown layers on their surface.12–17 It has been suggested that reasonable control over the surface oxidation level of Sb2S3 and Sb2Se3, wherein a medium level of surface oxidation is preferred, is beneficial to the optimization of the photoelectronic performance of the device.13–15,17 Theoretically, surface oxidation in the form of oxygen replacement for Se sites (OSe) can remove Se vacancy (VSe) defects and the resultant deep midgap states, which leads to the performance improvement of Sb2Se3 thin films.15,17
In this work, we demonstrate a simple method to prepare Sb2Se3 nanorods (NRs) in a mixture solution of oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OLA), and interestingly their surfaces can be oxidized to different degrees by varying the volume ratio of oleic acid as unveiled by XPS studies. Compared to slight and severe oxidation, the moderately oxidized Sb2Se3 NRs exhibit relatively better photoresponse performance in the aspects of the photocurrent, photocurrent/dark current ratio, and stability. We correlate the surface oxidation of Sb2Se3 with the hydroxylation effect arising from metal–oleate,18 which could in situ oxidize the surface of chalcogenide NCs to different degrees when different quantities of OA were used during the synthesis.
2. Experimental section
Synthesis of Sb2Se3 nanorods
All chemicals were purchased from Aladdin Chemistry Co. Ltd. and used as received. In a typical procedure with an oleic acid (OA)/oleylamine (OLA) volume ratio of 5:4, 0.114 g SbCl3 (0.5 mmol, AR) and 5 mL oleic acid (OA, AR) were added into a 50 ml three-necked flask, and then the flask was heated to 200 °C under magnetic stirring and a nitrogen flow. After 10 min at 200 °C, 4 mL oleylamine (OLA, C18: 80–90%, technical grade) was injected into the above solution and maintained at that temperature for 10 min, and then 0.0632 g selenium powder (0.8 mmol, 99.99%) was quickly added into the flask. After maintaining at 200 °C for 5 h, the flask was cooled to room temperature naturally. The products were precipitated by centrifuging at 6000 rpm, washed with hexane several times, and dried at 60 °C for further characterization. In the control experiments, different volume ratios of OA/OLA including 0:9, 2:7, 7:2, and 9:0 (mL mL−1) were used, keeping the total volume of OA and OLA unchanged (9 mL).
Sample characterization
Powder X-ray diffraction patterns (XRD) of the Sb2Se3 samples were collected on a D8 Advance diffractometer with graphite-monochromatized Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54178 Å, Bruker-AXS). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were obtained using a JSM-7001F to examine the morphology and size of the products. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images were obtained using a JEM-2100 electron microscope operated at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was conducted on an ESCALAB250Xi X-ray photoelectron spectrophotometer with an Al Kα excitation source (ThermoFisher Scientific). The UV-visible absorption spectra were measured on a Shimadzu UV-2450 spectrophotometer.
Photoelectric measurements
The photoelectric properties of the Sb2Se3 samples obtained with different ratios of OA/OLA were evaluated by making a sandwich-structured ITO/Sb2Se3/ITO device (Fig. 3a). The assembly details for this device can be found in our previous studies.12 Current–voltage (I–V) and time-dependent current (I–t) curves were measured on an electrochemical workstation (CHI660e) using a two-probe method. A xenon lamp (300 W) with a wavelength range of 400–780 nm was utilized as a white light source (100 mW cm−2).
3. Results and discussion
The XRD result shows that the Sb2Se3 sample, obtained from the typical synthetic procedure with an OA/OLA volume ratio of 5:4, crystallizes in the orthorhombic phase with high crystallinity and purity (Fig. 1a). All the diffraction peaks match well with the literature data for orthorhombic Sb2Se3 (space group: Pbnm; JPCDF#89-0821, a = 11.58 Å, b = 11.74 Å, and c = 3.955 Å).16 No impurity secondary phases, such as Sb2O3 and elemental Se, are detectable. The SEM image in Fig. 1b discloses the one-dimensional (1D) nanorod (NR) morphology of the as-obtained Sb2Se3 sample. The Sb2Se3 samples prepared at other OA/OLA volume ratios (0:9, 2:7, 7:2 and 9:0) also crystallize in the orthorhombic phase (Fig. S1 in the ESI†) and show a rod-like morphology, except for the NR and nanotube (NT) mixed morphology of the Sb2Se3 products synthesized in pure OA solution (Fig. S2†). Elemental analysis by EDS indicates an approximately 2:3 Sb/Se molar ratio for Sb2Se3 (Fig. S2†).

HRTEM and FFT studies were carried out on the Sb2Se3 NRs. As revealed in Fig. 2a, the results clearly unveil the [001]-oriented growth for the orthorhombic Pbnm Sb2Se3 NRs. This 1D crystal growth characteristic of NRs is closely linked to the highly structural anisotropy of orthorhombic-phase Sb2Se3. As building units, the ribbon-like [Sb4Se6]n running along the c-axis direction (Fig. 2b and c) makes the Sb2Se3 (nano)crystals prefer to grow into 1D structures with the c-axis direction (i.e., [001]) as their favorable growth orientation.16 A similar crystallographic growth feature also occurred in the isostructural V2–VI3 crystals of Sb2Se3, like Sb2S3 and Bi2S3.12,19,20

The optical and optoelectronic properties of the samples synthesized at different OA/OLA volume ratios were measured systematically. From the absorption spectra (Fig. 3a), it is seen that all of the as-prepared Sb2Se3 NRs exhibit strong optical absorption within the 400–1000 nm visible-near-infrared (vis-NIR) region. The bandgap energies can be assessed by Tauc fitting of the absorption spectra (Fig. S3†) and they lie in the range of 1.05–1.13 eV, consistent with the literature values.10,11,15,16 These results indicate that the variation of the OA volume does not show a significant impact on the optical absorption and bandgap energies of the Sb2Se3 NRs. On the other hand, we hoped to assess the influence of the OA volume (i.e., OA/OLA volume ratios) on the optoelectronic properties of Sb2Se3. Thus, we measured the optoelectronic properties of Sb2Se3 using an ITO/Sb2Se3/ITO structured device (inset of Fig. 3a), wherein the Sb2Se3 samples serve as an optical absorber and a photoconductor layer. According to the absorption spectra, it is expected that such a device is responsive to the wide-range vis-NIR light with the wavelength below 1000 nm.

The transient current–time (I–t) curve measurement is an effective method to obtain optoelectronic parameters, such as photocurrent, dark current and their ratio (on/off ratio), photoresponse speed, and switching stability.12,19,21I–t curves were systematically recorded on the devices made of Sb2Se3 NRs prepared at different OA/OLA volume ratios (Fig. 3b and c). For each OA/OLA ratio, 3–5 devices were fabricated using the samples prepared from different batches but with the same OA/OLA ratio. The statistical data of the optoelectronic parameters for these devices are summarized in Table 1. Generally, the Sb2Se3 NRs that were prepared in the presence of both OA and OLA exhibit high photoresponsivity, stable photo-switching, low dark current and high photocurrent/dark current ratios (i.e., on/off ratios), compared to their counterparts synthesized in pure OLA or pure OA (Fig. 3b and c). The top photoelectronic performance is detected for the samples obtained with OA/OLA volume ratios of 5:4 and 7:2, where on/off ratios of ∼35 and 27, relatively low dark current, and high photoconductivity and stability are achieved (Fig. 3d).

It is considered that the physical properties (such as optics and optoelectronics) are closely dependent on the size, morphology, composition, structure, surface defects and chemical surroundings.1–9,13–15,17 Although there are some differences in the morphology, size and crystallinity of the Sb2Se3 samples by changing the OA volume according to the SEM and XRD results (Fig. S1 and S2†), when considering that there are small differences in the optical absorption and band gaps for the different Sb2Se3 NR samples (Fig. 3a and S3†), the influences of these differences on the optoelectronic properties of the as-obtained Sb2Se3 samples may not be as significant as the influences of surface chemistry and defects. Sb-bearing chalcogenides such as Sb2S3, Sb2Se3, CuPbSbS3, etc. are vulnerable to surface oxidation due to the presence of V group element Sb, for which Sb–O bonds can be easily formed as usually verified by XPS analysis.12–17,22 The oxidation level plays a double-edged role in the optoelectronic performance of Sb2S3 and Sb2Se3. Partial surface oxidation, especially a low or modest level of surface oxidation, could improve the optoelectronic performance of solar cells or photodetectors.13–15,17 For Sb2Se3, it has been suggested in theory that an appropriate degree of surface oxidation can remove Se vacancies and the resultant deep-level midgap states,15,17 which is beneficial to its optoelectronic performance. In contrast, over-oxidation will degrade the performance.14,17
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is an accurate tool to probe the surface oxidation information of Sb-bearing chalcogenides.12–17,22 The XPS survey spectra and the identification of high-resolution Se 3d core-level peaks show that the Sb2Se3 samples synthesized at different OA/OLA volume ratios are of high purity (Fig. S4†). Shown in Fig. 4 are the Sb 3d core-level XPS spectra recorded on the different Sb2Se3 samples. Two major peaks with bind energies (BEs) centered at 528.1 eV and 537.6 eV are detected for all the samples, which are in good agreement with trivalent Sb 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 XPS peaks from Sb–Se bonds of Sb2Se3.16,17,23 Meanwhile, there is a relatively weak shoulder peak appearing with a slightly high BE (529.5 and 538.8 eV) for each major Sb–Se peak, which is due to the formation of Sb–O bonds.12–17,22–24 This suggests the occurrence of surface oxidation in the Sb2Se3 samples. It is noticeable that the intensities of the Sb–O shoulder peaks progressively increase with the increase of the OA volume. This trend means that the surface oxidation becomes heavier as the OA volume rises. The surface oxidation degrees can be quantitatively established according to the ratio of the area of the Sb–O peak relative to the sum area of the Sb–Se and Sb–O peaks. They are 1.20%, 5.67%, 21.58%, 30.82% and 51.49% for the Sb2Se3 samples prepared using 0, 2, 5, 7 and 9 mL OA, respectively (Fig. 4 and Table 1). The heavy surface oxidation (51.49%) leads to the obvious appearance of an O 1s signal (BE: 531.1 eV) in the XPS spectrum, which is likely from the chemisorbed O species that has a higher BE (e.g., –OH).24,25 In particular, the BE position of Sb 3d5/2 in Sb–O is up-shifted by ∼0.5 eV for the highly oxidized sample obtained from pure OA compared to those of the samples prepared with other OA volume ratios. This may be indicative of and explained by the evolution of Se–Sb–O (Sb2O3−xSex) into O–Sb–O (pure-phase Sb2O3) bonds at the surface of Sb2Se3 as its surface oxidation increases. In O–Sb–O, the loss of Sb 3d electrons needs more energy due to the stronger electronegativity of the oxygen atom. Fig. 4 also shows the Sb 3d core-level XPS spectrum of pure Sb2O3 (prepared from the hydrolysis reaction of antimony acetate in 9 mL OLA at 200 °C for 2 h, similar to the synthetic method Christian et al. reported26). By comparison, the BEs of Sb 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 from pure Sb2O3 are in good agreement with those from 51.49% surface oxidation (Sb–O bonds) of Sb2Se3 obtained from pure OA.

We try to build the relationship between the surface oxidation degree, the OA volume and the photoelectronic performance of the Sb2Se3 samples. It is revealed in Fig. 3d that a moderate level of surface oxidation (∼20–30% extracted from the XPS data) is favorable for the improvement of the optoelectronic performance. However, heavy oxidation higher than 50% has a detrimental effect on the optoelectronic performance of Sb2Se3, that is, lowering the on/off ratio and photoconductivity. Such a range is consistent with that found for Sb2S3, in which higher than 48.34% surface oxidation (which was identified by XPS and achieved by annealing Sb2S3 in air for 10 min or longer) was found to cause the degradation of solar cell efficiency.14 In our recent work based on theoretical calculations,17 it was suggested that high-degree surface oxidation will introduce more oxygen interstitials (Oi), which lead to deep trap states in the band gap of Sb2Se3 and therefore could deteriorate the optoelectronic performance due to the photoexcited carrier recombination.
As revealed by XPS analysis in Fig. 4, the introduction of OA results in an increase in the degree of surface oxidation of Sb2Se3 NRs. It has been proposed that OA molecules can easily lead to the hydroxylation of the surface metal cations in metal chalcogenide NCs, such as PbS.18 Similarly, it is believed that surface hydroxylation also occurs in Sb2Se3 NRs when OA is present in the synthesis and therefore boosts the in situ formation of Sb–OH bonds on the surface (Fig. 5). The density of surface Sb–OH bonds would be increased with the amount of OA. As proposed in Fig. 5, a hydroxylation process on a single [Sb4Se6]n ribbon is illustrated to demonstrate the surface hydroxylation of Sb2Se3. In the synthesis, Sb–oleate can be formed between Sb3+ and oleate (–OOCC17H32),27 which will remain on the outmost surface of Sb2Se3. Similar to the hydroxylation mechanism of PbS NCs,18 the surface Sb–oleate would be decomposed into (Sb2Se3)Sb–OH and OA molecules due to the presence of trace H2O. In the Sb2Se3 sample synthesized in pure OA, an OH group with an O 1s BE of 531.2 eV is detected in the XPS spectrum (Fig. 4), supporting the surface hydroxylation. H2O is likely from the precursors or generated from the formation of metal–oleate (e.g., Pb–oleate in ref. 18). Herein, Sb–oleate can be formed by the reaction of OA with SbCl3, SbOCl or Sb2O3. SbCl3 is easily hydrolyzed into SbOCl and Sb2O3 when it meets H2O remaining in the reaction system or in moist air.16,26,28,29 Under H2O-deficient conditions, Sb–OH is not stable and would dehydrate into Sb–O–Sb and H2O between two adjacent Sb–OH entities (Fig. 5), similar to the hydrolysis of SbCl3 into SbOCl or Sb2O3, rather than into Sb(OH)3.16,26,28,29 This process will reduce the amount of Sb–OH and form Sb–O bonds at the surface of Sb2Se3. It can be deduced that the surface hydroxylation of Sb2Se3 will be enhanced when more OA was added into the synthesis, which leads to the increase of the surface oxidation level in the Sb2Se3 samples. As a consequence, the control over the OA amount provides a designable, convenient pathway to tune the surface oxidation and photoelectric performance of Sb2Se3. Because of the low reaction temperature, namely 200 °C in this work, the surface oxidation or the formation of Sb–O bonds in Sb2Se3 is not possible from the thermal decomposition of Sb–oleate.30
 Fig. 5  Schematic illustration of the surface hydroxylation and oxidation of Sb2Se3. 
It should be pointed out that the sample post-treatments such as washing, drying and placement in air may contribute to the surface oxidation.14 Since the Sb2Se3 NRs obtained in pure OLA (without OA) have a very low oxidation level (1.20%, see Fig. 4), the oxidation induced by post-treatment should be minor. In order to obtain more accurate results, the periods of time between the sample synthesis and XPS measurements were kept nearly equal for the different Sb2Se3 samples. As a consequence, the surface oxidation degrees caused by air-exposure during the post-treatments for the different samples can be simply considered to be equal, and accordingly the difference in oxidation degrees is mainly due to the variation of the OA volume used for the sample preparation. In addition, annealing in air at an elevated temperature within different times can result in different levels of surface oxidation,14 which was also carried out on the Sb2Se3 NRs obtained at an OA/OLA volume ratio of 5:4. Typically, 40 min annealing at 200 °C leads to an increased surface oxidation degree (50.9% vs. 20.3% for the pristine sample by XPS) but a reduction of the photocurrent and on/off ratio (Fig. S5†). The results provide further evidence for the oxidation-degree-dependent optoelectronic properties of Sb2Se3. As revealed by the HRTEM and TEM studies (Fig. S6†), a long-term annealing process will lead to a thick surface oxidation layer and even destroy the NR shape.
4. Conclusions
We prepared Sb2Se3 nanorods (NRs), tuned their surface oxidation, and further correlated the oxidation levels with their photoelectronic properties. As revealed by XPS, the surface oxidation degree could be tuned from 1.20% to 51.49% by increasing the volume ratio of oleic acid (OA) (that is, changing the OA/OLA ratio). The photoelectronic characterization indicated that Sb2Se3 NRs with a modest level of surface oxidation (20–30%) exhibit superior photoresponsivity. A surface hydroxylation process was suggested, which is derived from the existence of Sb–oleate at the NR surface and a small quantity of H2O, as the main reason for the in situ oxidation of the Sb2Se3 surface. This process could lead to the formation of Sb–OH bonds and then a certain degree of oxidation of Sb2Se3 when various amounts of OA were added.
