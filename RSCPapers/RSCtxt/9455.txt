    , Accepted 26th October 2017First published on 26th October 2017AbstractOrganic–inorganic metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have made a striking breakthrough with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) over 22%. However, before moving to commercialization, the hysteresis of PSCs, characterized as an inconsistent photovoltaic conversion property at varied electric fields, should be eliminated for stable performance. Herein, we present a novel quadruple-cation perovskite absorber, KxCs0.05(FA0.85MA0.15)0.95Pb(I0.85Br0.15)3 (labeled as KCsFAMA), with which the hysteresis in PSCs can be fully eliminated irrespective of the electron transportation layers. The incorporation of potassium intensively promotes the crystallization of the perovskite film with a grain size up to ∼1 μm, doubled compared to the K free counterparts. Further characterization revealed that a lower interface defect density, longer carrier lifetime and fast charge transportation have all made contributions to the hysteresis-free, stable and high PCE (20.56%) of the KCsFAMA devices. Moreover, we present a 6 × 6 cm2 sub-module with the KCsFAMA composition achieving a high efficiency of 15.76% without hysteresis. This result suggests that the quadruple-cation perovskite is a highly attractive candidate for future developments of efficient and stable PSC modules.
Introduction
Hybrid organic–inorganic metal halide perovskite materials, which have excellent optoelectric properties such as high light extinction coefficient,1 long charge diffusion length,2,3 long carrier lifetime and high mobility,4 have been widely employed in photovoltaic applications with various configurations such as mesoporous and planar structures.5 Through the incorporation of additional I− ions into the perovskite films, a record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 22.1% has been achieved recently.6 This is a big step forward towards the commercialization of the perovskite solar cells (PSCs), however, other issues, such as the stability and the J–V hysteresis, still need to be addressed,7 especially for the simple planar structured PSCs.8
Hysteresis, actually, can be considered as a type of instability of photovoltaic conversion of solar cells when working under varied external electric fields. This phenomenon is not usually observed in silicon solar cells or other thin film solar cells, even though some similar semiconductors are involved. Current studies aiming to eliminate the hysteresis in PSCs are primarily focused on balancing the charge transport between the electron transport layer (ETL)/perovskite and the hole transport layer (HTL)/perovskite via ETL/HTL modification and perovskite interface treatments.9,10 For example, the typical TiO2 ETL based planar PSCs present severe hysteresis, which is normally ascribed to the low charge extraction of the ETL. Techniques such as ion doping, interface modification or passivation have been applied to address this issue.11–13 However, these modifications present a distractive direction from the focus of the perovskite absorber, which is the key cause for the instability of the PSCs. The hysteresis is proposed to be originated from not only the unbalanced charge transport, but also ferroelectric effects, ion migration, carrier trapping, capacitive effects, etc.,14,15 which are all strongly related to the quality of the perovskites. Moreover, a high quality perovskite absorber, that induces fewer defects and also restricts the ion migration with reduced dominating ion transfer channels at grain boundaries, is also crucial to achieve high stability and device performance.16–18 Thus, it would be highly attractive to obtain efficient, hysteresis-free and stable PSCs simultaneously by the method of producing a superior perovskite film that is able to supersede the effects of the ETL/HTL layers and acquire charge transportation properties similar to those of sophisticated inorganic solar cells.
Recently, forming hybrid-cation/anion perovskites and additive incorporation have emerged as an effective strategy to promote perovskite quality. For example, thiourea or thio-semicarbazide with methylammonium additives to methylamine lead iodide (MAPbI3) perovskite showed increased grain size and device performance.19,20 Cadmium (Cd) and aluminium (Al) ions have been demonstrated to increase the MAPbI3 crystal size resulting in an increased photoluminescence and reduced density of electronic defects.21,22 Lead thiocyanate (Pb(SCN)2) and PCBM also increased the MAPbI3 crystal size and improve the fill factor of the device performance.23,24 Through blending formamidine lead iodide (FAPbI3) and methylamine lead bromine (MAPbBr3), superior stability can be achieved for this new category of mixed perovskite solar cells (labeled as FAMA perovskite).25 The doping of Cs and/or Rb in mixed perovskites has markedly improved the PCE and stability of the PSCs.26,27 Notably, a recent report achieved an average PCE of 20.2% and the encapsulated device retained 95% efficiency at 85 °C for 500 hours under full solar illumination and the maximum power point tracking.27 Although the above mentioned routes have improved the efficiency and/or stabilities of the devices, unfortunately, notable hysteresis still exists and cannot be fully removed via such perovskite film optimizations. This is probably due to the impure crystalline phases, small crystal size or the existence of additives such as the organic agents in the perovskite film somehow inhibiting the charge transport etc.28,29
To tackle this problem, we have successfully demonstrated stable and hysteresis-free PSCs via a simple preparation of a potassium-containing quadruple-cation perovskite (Kx(Cs0.05(FA0.85MA0.15)0.95Pb(I0.85Br0.15)3) labeled as KCsFAMA, where Pb is regarded as a divalent metal). The grain size of the KCsFAMA perovskite is significantly increased compared to the CsFAMA and FAMA perovskites. We present PSC devices with the configuration of FTO/compact SnO2/perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au. Without any modification at the ETL and interface, the hysteresis observed for the CsFAMA and FAMA perovskites was fully eliminated in the KCsFAMA devices. This phenomenon is also observed in devices with a TiO2 ETL. The devices with a KCsFAMA absorber presented balanced charge transport, high carrier lifetime and also reduced trap densities, and thus attained a high PCE of 20.56% (0.16 cm2) and 15.76% for a 6 × 6 cm2 module without hysteresis.
Results and discussion
To form a quadruple-cation perovskite film, the KI precursor was added to the CsFAMA perovskite ink with desired concentration (see details in the ESI†). The energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) of the KCsFAMA perovskite film with 3.5% molar ratio of K addition is presented in Fig. S1 (ESI†). It is clearly shown that the K elements were homogenously distributed across the perovskite film, the same as the Cs element. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns (Fig. 1a) show that the FAMA, CsFAMA and KCsFAMA almost had identical diffraction patterns, indicating the black perovskite phase has been formed. For all the monovalent inorganic perovskites (APbI3), only Cs is matched to sustain the perovskite structure. Even rubidium (Rb) which is a little smaller than Cs could not form the “established perovskite”.27,30 Undoubtedly, KPbI3 could not form the “established perovskite” according to the Goldschmidt tolerance factor because for the K ion it is less than 0.8, even smaller than that of Rb.27 Actually, no black phase of the KPbI3 perovskite was formed even when the temperature was above 300 °C, and it melted when the temperature was over 450 °C (Fig. S2, ESI†). Understandably, the XRD peaks (Fig. 1a inset) of the CsFAMA perovskite have a slight right-shift compared with the FAMA perovskite which means the Cs cations have replaced some of the FA/MA cations and shrunk the lattice of the perovskite. While with the incorporation of the K ions, all the peak intensities have increased significantly and showed a slight left-shift (Fig. 1a). The left shift of the peaks indicates the enlargement of the d-spacing caused by forming the KCsFAMA perovskite. However, the exact positions where K ions stay is not clear for now. It probably takes more than one K ion to occupy the A position and/or function as an interstitial ion of the perovskite lattice. This proposal could be supported by the further left shifting of the (101) peaks on increasing the amount of K in the KCsFAMA perovskite (Fig. S3, ESI†). The insertion of the K ions into the lattice has also been confirmed by the X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS), as there was obvious peak shifting of Pb 4f, I 3d and Br 3d, suggesting disturbed interaction between those ions with K inclusion (Fig. S4, ESI†).

In order to further understand the properties of the KCsFAMA perovskite film, ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy has been conducted to examine the light harvesting changes among the different perovskites (FAMA, CsFAMA, and KCsFAMA) (Fig. 1b). The KCsFAMA films exhibit enhanced light absorption, and a small red shift occurs which means a reduced bandgap (Fig. S5, ESI†). The slight broadening of the light absorption as well as the higher absorption would make a slight contribution to the photocurrent. Fig. 1c shows the scanning electron microscope (SEM) image of the dense FAMA perovskite film with the grain size of ∼550 nm. With the additive of Cs, the grain size of the perovskite film (CsFAMA, Fig. 1d) became a little smaller to ∼500 nm as the presence of the Cs ions accelerates the nucleation of the perovskite to produce more nuclei and thus smaller crystals. Interestingly, the grain size of KCsFAMA increased (∼1 μm) and was even larger than that of the FAMA sample as shown in Fig. 1e. In general, minor doping could decrease the activation energy for the crystallization.31 Thus, with the increasing amount of K, it accelerated the crystallization of perovskite, resulting in an increased grain size. However, with the further increase of the K cations, the K+ existed as an impurity between the grains to inhibit the grain growth. Therefore, the grain size decreased with the further increasing of the amount of K, as clearly shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†). The increased grain size is mainly induced by K+ instead of I− because the perovskite added with the same amount of HI did not show any increase in the grain size (Fig. S7, ESI†). The larger grains with better crystallinity would benefit the performance of the solar cells.
Photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurements were performed to further understand the recombination behaviours of the photo-excited carriers in the perovskite films. An obviously increased PL intensity was obtained in the KCsFAMA perovskite films compared to the CsFAMA and FAMA perovskite films (Fig. 2a), which reveals the much less defects in the KCsFAMA perovskite films. The TRPL spectra also exhibit a much longer lifetime in the KCsFAMA perovskite films than that of the CsFAMA or FAMA perovskite films (Fig. 2b). These PL results demonstrated that the KCsFAMA perovskite film presents fewer irradiative defects as the K incorporation produced high crystallinity confirmed by the XRD data.

The planar perovskite solar cells based on the structure of FTO/compact SnO2/perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au as illustrated in Fig. 3a have been fabricated via a modified green antisolvent process.32 The corresponding cross-sectional SEM image (Fig. 3b) clearly shows the device configuration with the different layers of (i) FTO, (ii) compact SnO2, (iii) KCsFAMA perovskite with large grains, (iv) Spiro-OMeTAD, and (v) Au, respectively. The photovoltaic characteristics and the distribution of the results for the FAMA, CsFAMA and KCsFAMA devices are plotted in Fig. 3c–f, and the average photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table S1 (ESI†). All the devices were tested under 1 Sun AM 1.5G illumination with a mask of 0.16 cm2. An obvious increase in Voc from 1.085 V for the FAMA cells and 1.097 V for the CsFAMA cells to 1.132 V for the KCsFAMA cells has been observed in Fig. 3c. This increased Voc can be attributed to the self-passivation properties of the K cations, because these improved the crystallinity and increased the grain size of the KCsFAMA film (Fig. 1). This means less grain boundaries and fewer defects at the interfaces and then reduced recombination with the extended charge carrier lifetime as confirmed by the PL tests. The distributions of Jsc of the different devices are shown in Fig. 3d. It is worth noting that a smaller amount of K cation incorporation slightly increased the Jsc, but it eventually decreased the Jsc when the amount increased further. These phenomena are clearly shown by the corresponding J–V curves and EQE spectra in Fig. S8 (ESI†). While for the FF, it has been significantly increased with the K incorporation, from 0.75 for FAMA and 0.76 for CsFAMA to 0.78 for KCsFAMA perovskite solar cells. This great improvement was attributed to the reduced series resistance and increased shunt resistance due to additional K (Table S1, ESI†). All these improvements by the incorporation of K contribute to the increased PCEs for the mixed perovskite solar cells (Fig. 3f).

The photovoltaic characteristics of the champion devices of FAMA, CsFAMA, KCsFAMA are listed in Table S2 (ESI†), and the typical J–V curves are shown in Fig. 4a. The KCsFAMA device has achieved a high PCE over 20%, with a Voc of 1.132 V, a Jsc of 22.95 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.79. Fig. 4b shows the EQE spectra of the corresponding perovskite devices, and the integrated photocurrent densities are 22.30 mA cm−2, 22.38 mA cm−2, and 22.52 mA cm−2 for the FAMA, CsFAMA and KCsFAMA perovskite devices, respectively, which well matches with the Jsc measured by the J–V curves (Fig. 4a). The corresponding steady-state output current densities at the maximum power point of the devices are shown in Fig. 4c. The KCsFAMA perovskite device not only shows a very stable power output but also an extremely fast photoresponse compared to the devices without K. This rapid photoresponse reflects much more efficient charge extraction in KCsFAMA devices compared to FAMA and CsFAMA samples that adopt the same cell configuration. Furthermore, the long-term stability of the KCsFAMA devices is extensively enhanced compared to FAMA and CsFAMA devices when stored under ambient air conditions with 10 RH% without encapsulation over 1000 hours, indicating that the K incorporation helps to stabilize the perovskite crystals. Therefore, the application of a quadruple-cation KCsFAMA perovskite absorber has greatly improved both the PCEs and stability of perovskite solar cells.

Besides the improvement of the PCEs, the most interesting thing was the elimination of common hysteresis in the planar perovskite devices. Both the FAMA (18.94% for the reverse scan (RS), 15.31% for the forward scan (FS) and a hysteresis index (HI, shown in Table S2, ESI†) of 0.123) and CsFAMA (19.21% for RS, 15.52% for FS, and a HI of 0.114) perovskite devices show obvious hysteresis. However, there is almost no hysteresis present in the KCsFAMA solar cells (Table S2 (ESI†) and Fig. 4a), with a high PCE of 20.56% (FS) and 20.17% (RS), giving a HI of only 0.016. It was found that on increasing the doping content of K, the HI decreased accordingly (Table S2, ESI†). The FAMA devices had an obvious hysteresis, and no improvement was obtained by Cs doping, similar to the results reported by Grätzel et al.33 Notably, the hysteresis was dramatically inhibited when the high quality quadruple-cation KCsFAMA absorber was constructed. We further testified this conclusion by preparing solar cells with a TiO2 ETL (without any modification), which is well-known for causing hysteresis in planar PSCs. The results led to an identical conclusion that the KCsFAMA absorber inhibits the hysteresis irrespective of the ETL layers (Fig. S9, ESI†), while in FAMA or CsFAMA devices the hysteresis remains.
As the hysteresis originated from the defects and the carrier trapping, capacitive effects,14,15 we believe that the decreased hysteresis was ascribed to the increased charge conductivity and reduced defects with the incorporation of K cations. As shown in Fig. 5a, the KCsFAMA perovskite film has a better conductivity than the CsFAMA and FAMA, which demonstrated the fast carrier transport in the K-containing perovskite films. In order to accurately assess the trap density in these devices, we have fabricated an electron-only device with a glass/ITO/PCBM/perovskite/PCBM/Au architecture and a glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au hole-only device. All these devices’ dark J–V characteristics were measured to obtain the electron and hole trap densities.17Fig. 5b and c show the typical dark J–V characteristics of electron-only and hole-only devices with different perovskites. The trap densities were estimated by the space-charge-limited-current (SCLC) technique.34 The linear region at low bias corresponds to the ohmic response. A trap filling process is identified by the marked increase of the current injection at the intermediate region. The trap density levels are continuously filled by increasing the bias until reaching the trap-filling limit voltage (VTFL). The trap density can be calculated from the following relation:3VTFL = entL2/2εε0,where L is the thickness of the perovskite films, ε is the relative dielectric constant of the perovskite (taken as the value of 32 for MAPbI3 from a previous report13), and ε0 is the vacuum permittivity. The electron and hole trap density in the KCsFAMA perovskite are calculated to be 7.87 × 1015 cm−3 and 3.94 × 1015 cm−3, respectively, which are much lower than those of the FAMA (1.57 × 1016 cm−3 and 1.77 × 1016 cm−3) and the CsFAMA (1.28 × 1016 cm−3 and 1.47 × 1016 cm−3) perovskite. We consider this reduced trap density a result of the high quality of the perovskite crystals and the possible passivation effect from the K doping. The reduced trap densities contribute to reducing and eventually eliminating hysteresis in the mixed perovskite devices.35

(e) Series resistance and (f) recombination resistance of FAMA, CsFAMA and KCsFAMA devices at different biases. 
To further understand the photovoltaic responses of KCsFAMA perovskite solar cells, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements which are considered as a very useful technique to reveal the underlying carrier transport behaviors in the PSCs have been performed on the FAMA, CsFAMA and KCsFAMA PSCs, respectively.36 The Nyquist plots shown in Fig. 5d were obtained under AM 1.5G with an applied bias voltage of 1.0 V close to their Voc. There are two different semicircles in the Nyquist plots which are located at the high and low frequency ranges. In general, the high frequency one corresponds to the hole transport in spiro-OMeTAD, and the other one is related to recombination occurring at the interfaces by fitting with an equivalent circuit of a series resistance (Rs) in series with two RC elements,37,38 and the fitted Rs and Rrec (recombination resistance) were plotted with respect to the applied forward biases as shown in Fig. 5e–f. The value of Rs in the KCsFAMA perovskite was much lower compared to that for the FAMA or CsFAMA perovskite devices, while the Rrec in the KCsFAMA device is much higher than that for the non-K cation-containing devices. Then the EIS data clearly shows the improved charge transport and reduced recombination in perovskite devices with K doping. We also measured the corresponding J–V characteristics under different incident light intensities ranging from 0.05 Sun to 1 Sun (Fig. S10, ESI†), and a more monotonic increase in Voc with the light intensities of the KCsFAMA device also demonstrated the low recombination rate compared to the FAMA or CsFAMA devices.39 Therefore, the accelerated charge transport and reduced recombination were responsible for eliminating hysteresis in the K-containing mixed perovskite devices.
Hysteresis was first observed and often reported in small area PSCs. When manufacturing the solar cells with the area over several square centimeters or even for module sized devices, this phenomenon is more severe due to the less efficient charge transfer induced by the elongated circuits and the additional inter-cell connections. However, with the application of the KCsFAMA perovskite absorber (Fig. 6a), we present a high efficiency module with the size of 6 × 6 cm2, demonstrating a negligible hysteresis in the J–V curve. The detailed fabrication procedures of the module are shown in Fig. S11 (ESI†). The champion device consists of 6 series connected cells with an area of 5.5 × 0.6 cm2 and possesses a high PCE of 15.76%, a Voc of 6.794 V, a Jsc of 3.57 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.65 for FS, and a similar PCE of 15.56% with a Voc of 6.804 V, a Jsc of 3.52 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.65 for RS under 1 Sun AM 1.5G illumination (Fig. 6b). This result indicates that the quadruple-cation absorber could effectively inhibit hysteresis and achieve high efficiency even in an up-scaled device. Thus, by avoiding delicate surface modification of the HTL/ETL and/or cell architecture construction, employing the high quality KCsFAMA perovskite absorber could provide enormous convenience for the fabrication of large area PSCs aiming for future commercial applications.

Conclusion
In summary, we have demonstrated a novel quadruple-cation perovskite absorber (KCsFAMA) with the incorporation of K, Cs, FA and MA as the A-position cations to attain a high efficiency and elimination of hysteresis. We found that this perovskite composition enables highly crystallized absorber films with the grain size over 1 μm, doubled compared to the K-free counterparts. This also contributed to the enhanced light absorption and longer carrier lifetime. A hysteresis-free highly efficient PSC was obtained based on a planar structure device with a PCE of 20.56% (FS) and 20.17% (RS). This hysteresis elimination is irrespective of the ETLs (both SnO2 and TiO2) and no surface modification or doping is required. Characterizations suggest that the eliminated hysteresis can be ascribed to the enhanced conductivity which accelerated the charge transport and distribution, as well as the reduced carrier recombination and decreased trap density in the perovskite and its interfaces. The KCsFAMA also exhibited outstanding stability with no decrease in PCE over 1000 hours stored under ambient air (10 ± 5 RH%) without encapsulation. Furthermore, a high PCE of 15.76% (FS) and 15.56% (RS) were achieved for the large size 6 × 6 cm2 modules with an active area of 20 cm2. These results suggest that with the high quality KCsFAMA absorber it is possible to achieve highly efficient, hysteresis free and stable devices with the simple optimization of the absorber, which provides a convenient method for potential up-scaling.
