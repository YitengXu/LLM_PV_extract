    , Accepted 30th January 2018First published on 30th January 2018AbstractThe introduction of a double-gallium (Ga) gradient plays a key role in pushing the performance of Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGSe) solar cells to a more competitive level. In particular, the location of the front-gradient starting position strongly affects the barrier of the electron transport path, and this is not based on either significantly reducing the electron collection or decreasing the fill factor. Here we present and implement a double-Ga gradient design for CIGSe absorber layers using a diamine–dithiol solution approach. By regulating the front-gradient starting location, three CIGSe absorber layers with different Ga gradients were successfully constructed; these materials maximize solar spectrum absorption and improve the charge collection efficiency. Moreover, this facile solution-process approach does not require expensive vacuum equipment and can be applied to roll-to-roll printing technology. By combining optimal front-gradients with the back gradient, the short-circuit current has been increased by 17% and a maximum improvement in CIGSe efficiency to 13.12% achieved through adjusting the front-gradient to an optimum location.
1 Introduction
Chalcopyrite photovoltaics based on Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGSe) and related materials have proven to be one of the most competitive solar technologies, with steadily increasing record cell efficiencies up to 22.6%.1–3 Unfortunately, almost all of the high performance CIGSe solar cells have been fabricated via vacuum-based techniques, including co-evaporation and sputtering; these techniques require expensive vacuum equipment and have high energy consumption.4–9 It is believed that a solution-process approach has the potential to significantly lower the cost and increase throughput compared to conventional vacuum-based methods. However, the highest certified efficiency obtained using hydrazine-based solution processed CIGSe solar cells is 17.3%, which is still 30.6% lower than that of vacuum-based devices (22.6%).10 Theoretical and experimental studies have identified that constructing double-Ga gradients is an effective approach for improving the collection of minority carriers and for decreasing recombination that occurs near the molybdenum (Mo) back electrode.11–13 One of the benefits of a Ga gradient in CIGSe absorber layers is the formation of an additional electric field, which assists the drift of free electrons towards the front junction. This contributes to an effective collection of charge carriers, especially for near-infrared photon energies.11–13 Another advantage is that it results in improving the absorption of low-energy photons because of the presence of a notch region close to the CdS/CIGSe interface. In addition, a small conduction band offset (<0.3 eV) can effectively improve the interface quality.12,14,15 As for the back-gradient, the Ga/(Ga + In) ratio declines gradually with increasing distance from the Mo electrode and comes to an end near the space charge region (SCR). The formation of a back-gradient results in an internal drift field (ξA), and the strength of ξA is related to the slope of the back-gradient16 according to the formula:  where μe, x, ΔL, and τ stand for the electron migration rate, the back-gradient width, the diffusion length, and the electron lifetime, respectively. ξA can effectively increase the diffusion length of electrons, and we can therefore achieve a higher short circuit current (Jsc) by building a stronger back-gradient. However, the narrower bandgap width at the p–n junction will inevitably lead to a smaller open circuit voltage (Voc). Hence, a front-gradient is introduced to improve Voc, but the front-gradient will cause a transport barrier for photon-generated electrons. If the front-gradient starts from the edge of the SCR, it will not form a barrier for electronic transport at zero bias; however, under high bias, it still forms a barrier to electrons, which affects the transport of electrons. If the front-gradient starts from the quasi-neutral region (QNR), and forms an electron transport barrier at any bias potential, it will significantly decrease the electron collection and reduce both the short circuit current and the fill factor (FF), thus reducing the photoelectric conversion efficiency (PCE).2,17 The selection of the front-gradient should not be based on either significantly reducing electron collection or on FF. Therefore, it is still of great importance to determine the optimal locations of the front-gradients.
Given the discussion above, in this report, we adjusted the starting location of the front-gradient to improve the performance of CIGSe solar cells via a low-toxicity solution-process approach. Four CIGSe thin films with different Ga gradients were successfully prepared and clearly detected. This result firmly demonstrates that the Ga gradients were constructed not only via co-evaporation techniques but also via the solution-process approach. Thus, our approach involves narrowing the efficiency gap between hydrazine and non-hydrazine solution-based CIGSe solar cells, and it is believed that this approach is an effective and key method for pursuing the record efficiency of vacuum-based CIGSe solar cells.10,18 In this work, Cu2S, In2Se3, and Ga were used as the starting materials and dissolved in a mixture of 1,2-ethanedithiol (edtH2) and 1,2-ethylenediamine (en). A particular benefit of this approach is that impurity elements can be absolutely excluded, and the solvents used in the fabrication process are safer and more cost-effective compared to those used in the hydrazine-based solution process.19–22
2 Results and discussion
We designed four precursor films with different gradient types based on a thiol–amine solution process to explore systematically the influence of the starting location of front-gradients on the performance of CIGSe solar cells. Schematic illustrations of the fabrication procedure of the CIGSe absorber layers with different Ga gradients are shown in Fig. 1. In this work, we chose Cu2S, In2Se3, Ga and Se powders as starting materials, which are highly soluble in a solvent mixture of 1,2-ethanedithiol/1,2-ethylenediamine (edtH2/en).23,24 Four CIGSe precursor solutions with different Ga ratios (10%, 30%, 35%, and 50%) were prepared by adjusting the [Ga]/([Ga] + [In]) ratios, as shown in Fig. S1.† The dissolution of the starting materials is initiated by the transfer of protons from the thiol (edtH2) to the amine (en).25 Because of the presence of the R-NH2 groups, the edtH2 is deprotonated. A possible hypothesis for the dissolution of these metal selenide, metal sulfide, and elemental metal appears to be the formation of thiolatoselenometallate/thiolatometallate anions counterbalanced by +H3N-R-NH3+ cations.26 Three different Ga gradients were designed according to the fabrication procedures illustrated in Fig. 1b–d. We controlled the thickness of each of the four precursor films within the range of 1730–1760 nm to better compare the homogeneous films and graded films, and the detailed thicknesses are given in Table S1† and Fig. 2. Both the shape of the front-gradient and the notch region with a lower band gap close to the front interface play key roles in enhancing the absorption of low-energy photons.12,27 Therefore, the design of the front-gradient is critical for the performance of the CIGSe devices. In this study, we adjusted the location of the notch region by controlling the thicknesses of stages 2 and 4 and by keeping the thicknesses of stages 1 and 3 at the same level. Using this adjustment, we expected to determine an optimal starting location for the front-gradient to achieve the best performance of the CIGSe solar cells.

Cross-sectional SEM images of the designed precursor and selenized CIGSe films with different Ga gradients (type I–IV) are shown in Fig. 2. The detailed thicknesses of the precursor films are marked in the images. Compared to the homogenous selenized films (type I), the crystallinity of the graded films from type II to IV gradually gets worse. It is also observed that the fine-grained layer becomes thicker when the Ga ratio increases from 30 to 50% in the vicinity of the Mo electrode. Thus, excessive Ga doping can obviously inhibit grain growth, and this result is consistent with many previous reports regarding the influence of the [Ga]/([Ga] + [In]) ratios in absorbers on crystal growth.28–30 As for the explanation, Ga atoms tended to accumulate near the bottom Mo/CIGSe interface resulting from the intentional designs of different Ga gradients and different diffusivities of Ga and indium (In) atoms during the process of selenization.31,32 Therefore, an accumulation of Ga atoms near the Mo electrode decreases the grain size, which is why a thicker separated layer with small grain size appears close to the Mo/CIGSe interface as the [Ga]/[Ga] + [In] ratio rises.
The chemical composition of the selenized CIGSe thin film plays an important role in determining the performance of CIGSe solar cells. To investigate the composition of the CIGSe absorber layers with different Ga gradients, the selenized films were dissolved in 5% nitric acid solution for total film analysis, and inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) measurements were then carried out to determine the detailed elemental ratios in the samples; the results are shown in Table S2.† The obtained results were in the ranges of [Cu]/([Ga] + [In]) = 0.89–0.91 and [Ga]/([Ga] + [In]) = 0.26–0.29, which are the ranges required for high efficiency CIGSe solar cells.33
To determine the structural quality of the as-prepared and selenized CIGSe thin films with different Ga gradients, X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed. The results demonstrated the well-crystallized and single-phase nature of the CIGSe film on Mo glass (Fig. 3a and b). Apart from the peaks of Mo and MoSe2, all diffraction peaks could be indexed to a tetragonal chalcopyrite-type phase, which demonstrates that introducing excess Ga did not change the crystalline phases. To further reveal the distribution of elemental Ga throughout the selenized films with Ga gradients, a chemical etching method was carried out on type III of sample C. The chemical etching method used solutions of HBr/Br2/H2O to gradually etch the CIGSe film from the surface (the etch rate was about 100 nm per 100 s).31,34,35 In this study, five identical selenized films with type III gradients were prepared and then etched at a certain position (marked [a] to [e] in the inset of Fig. 3d). The enlarged (220/204) peaks of the XRD patterns of the corresponding films are shown in Fig. 3e. Interestingly, the enlarged peaks of the (220/204) plane exhibited an asymmetric shape, first shifting to a smaller angle (from 44.63° to 44.60°), and then shifting toward a higher angle (44.80°). Also, the full width at half maximum (FWHM) became wider. The (112), (312)/(116), (400), and (332)/(316) planes also showed very similar trends. It is clear that the diffraction peaks systematically shift to higher angles because of the decreased unit cell volume with an increasing amount of In being replaced with Ga.31,34 In addition, it is also observed that the peaks become weaker with longer etching time. This result suggests that the different Ga compositions of the graded films result in inhomogeneous layers, and implies that the upper and bottom layers may have a higher concentration of Ga than the middle layer. As expected, this result corresponds well with the designed distribution of Ga throughout the graded films.

To detect the Ga composition profiles, the CIGSe absorber layers with different Ga gradients were investigated by secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) and the resulting Ga profiles of the four samples (A–D) are shown in Fig. 4. The heights of the front-gradients and back-gradients are indicated as ΔXf and ΔXb, respectively, and the distances from the notch to the front surface and to the back contact are indicated as ΔLf and ΔLb, respectively. The influence of a front gradient has previously been investigated via computer simulations and experiments.2,36,37 Generally, it is believed that electrons produced within the SCR are efficiently collected because of the assistance of a strong electric field (ξA).2,16 However, an overly pronounced front gradient tends to result in a barrier to electrons, leading to increased recombination in the QNR.12 A 4-stage spin-coating process was used in the fabrication of the CIGSe absorber layer to obtain suitable front and back gradients. In this work, we were able to adjust the thicknesses of stages 4 and 2 and keep the thicknesses of stages 1 and 3 the same by controlling the spin-coating/sintering cycles. By controlling the thicknesses of stages 4 and 2, we can adjust the position of the notch on the surface. Meanwhile, ΔLf was increased from 80 nm for sample B to 440 nm for sample D. Furthermore, a noticeable increase of ΔXf from 0.051 for sample B to 0.075 for sample C was observed. With a short length of stage 4 for sample B, a weaker front-gradient (ΔXf = 0.051) and a lower Ga content near the p–n junction were obtained. It is reported that a slight front-gradient usually minimizes recombination in the SCR, and a strong back-gradient effectively drives the photo-generated charge carriers separated from the Mo back electrode.10 In the case of sample D, a relatively flat and wide grading profile (ΔXf = 0.039 and ΔXb = 0.069) was obtained by further increasing the spin-coating cycles for stage 4 and decreasing the spin-coating cycles for stage 2. In comparison, sample C clearly has a suitable Ga grading profile (ΔXf = 0.075 and ΔXb = 0.125). More direct evidence of the existence of inhomogeneous selenized films with different Ga compositions was obtained using EDX line measurements (Fig. S2†). For the type I films, no apparent variation in the Ga concentration was observed throughout the films, except for a distinct fluctuation close to the interface of Mo/CIGSe. In contrast, the concentration distributions of Ga in the designed graded films (type II–IV) varied significantly with the film thickness. As expected, these various trends in the EDX line measurements are very similar to the SIMS results. This further confirmed the presence of different Ga gradients with which we intentionally designed the CIGSe precursor films. Moreover, we calculated the corresponding band gap (Eg) as a function of sputter depth according to the following formula:Eg = ECuGaSeg2 + ECuInSeg2(1 − x) − bx(1 − x)where x, b, and Eg are the measured Ga content determined using SIMS, the bowing parameter (b = 0.2 eV), and the band gap (Eg of CuGaSe2 is 1.68 eV, and Eg of CuInSe2 is 1.04 eV).16,31 The calculated results are indicated by the red dashed line in Fig. 4. The calculated values of Eg for the notch in the CIGSe absorber layer are in good agreement with the value of Eg determined from EQE (Table 1).

To further evaluate the influence of the different Ga gradient on device performance, a series of glass/Mo/Cu(In,Ga)Se2/CdS/i-ZnO/ITO/Ag solar cells were fabricated. Digital photographs of the CIGSe solar cells with different Ga gradients are shown in Fig S1.†Fig. 5a shows the current–voltage (J–V) curves of the best homogeneous CIGSe solar cell and the best gradient CIGSe solar cell under AM 1.5G illumination, and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. Compared to the homogeneous CIGSe solar cell, the performance of the best-graded CIGSe solar cell has an obvious improvement from 11.40 to 13.12% because of a 17% improvement in Jsc as shown in Fig. S3.† The corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1, and the structure of the champion cell is shown in Fig. S4.† The Rs values were calculated from the plots of dV/dJ versus (J + Jsc)−1; the plots of the four samples are shown in Fig. S5.† With the introduction of a strong back-gradient, the Jsc of sample B increased from 27.14 to 31.99 mA cm−2. This improvement in the value of Jsc can be explained by the increase in the collection of minority carriers because of an internal drift field (ξA). However, the value of Voc for sample B decreases from 591 to 556 mV because of a narrower bandgap width at the p–n junction. To improve the Voc and to maintain the Jsc at an optimal value, an obvious front-gradient can be obtained by regulating the notch. When the value of ΔLf was increased from 80 to 200 nm, the Voc was maintained above 585 mV as expected, and this value was very close to the value of Voc for the homogenous CIGSe solar cells. Also, the device achieved a best PCE result of 13.12% (Fig. 5b). However, when the value of ΔLf was further increased to about 440 nm, the value of Jsc for sample D decreased to 29.64 mA cm−2. This can be explained as follows: when the front gradient partly starts from the QNR, it forms an electron transport barrier at a bias potential, decreases the electron collection, and reduces the short circuit current and the fill factor (FF), thus reducing the PCE. Because of this trade-off in our case, ΔLf was limited to values of about 200 nm; in this notch, the PCE is effectively improved compared to that of the homogenous CIGSe device (sample A). The long-term I–T curves of Cu(In,Ga)Se2 solar cells stored in air for ∼200 hours are shown in Fig. S6.† The current density of all samples can remain stable for quite a long time. Meanwhile, we also provide the corresponding SEM images of the Cu(In,Ga)Se2 solar cells with different Ga gradients after the I–T test, as shown in Fig. S7.† There is no obvious morphology change of the gradient Cu(In,Ga)Se2 films after long time illumination.

External quantum efficiency (EQE) characterization was carried out to better understand how the gradient structures affect the optical character, and the results are presented in Fig. 5c. All CIGSe devices exhibit distinct spectral responses, and samples B and C show a higher value (greater than 90%) in the visible and near-infrared regions. It is clear that samples B and C have a higher photo-response at short and long wavelengths compared to the homogenous CIGSe sample, and this implies that there is a lower recombination of photo-generated carriers in the CIGSe absorber layer and at the interface between the Mo electrode and the bulk.22 The values of Jsc obtained from integrating the EQE spectra are 27.89, 30.95, 30.81, and 28.94 mA cm−2, respectively, for samples A–D with different Ga gradients, and these values are in good agreement with the values of Jsc determined from the J–V curves. The band gap (Eg) of the CIGSe absorber layer was graphically determined by plotting [E × ln(1 − EQE)]2versus E (Fig. 5d). The band gap value of each sample is in line with the minimum Ga content at the notch position. Sample C has an optimal band gap value of 1.14 eV, lower than that of sample A (Eg = 1.17 eV). Generally, a larger bandgap implies a larger Voc deficit (Voc,def = Eg/q − Voc). A lower Voc,def may imply that the graded film has lower recombination in the SCR.38
However, we have only provided the best device efficiency of CIGSe solar cells without adequate parallel statistics to draw a final conclusion.39,40 To ensure the reproducibility of the results, more than 80 separate CIGSe devices were fabricated with different Ga gradients. Histograms of the PCE for the 80 separate CIGSe solar cells that had different Ga gradients are shown in Fig. 6. These results indicate that fabricating Ga-graded devices has a clear advantage in terms of cell-performance characteristics. It is obvious that the devices with type III Ga gradients have a higher average PCE than the other gradient types. The parallel statistical results confirm that the experiment using different Ga gradients is reliable and reproducible.

Capacitance–voltage (C–V) profiling is an important electrical characterization method for investigating CIGSe thin film solar cells.2,19,41Fig. 7 shows the C–V curves and the depletion width derived from the C–V curves of the CIGSe solar cells that had different Ga gradients. These data were measured under a reverse bias of 0 to −1 V at 300 K. The detailed values of Wd and NC–V for the CIGSe devices that had different Ga gradients are listed in Table S3.† For the CIGSe thin film solar cells with different Ga gradients, all of the measured capacitances decreased consistently with an increase in the reverse bias voltage, and this demonstrates that the reverse bias voltage can decrease the capacitance and expand the depletion width in CIGSe devices.41 The depletion width is one of the critical parameters that influences the conductivity of charge carriers.42 It is commonly accepted that a narrow depletion region has negative effects on the charge carrier collection in CIGSe solar cells. In this work, fabricating Ga gradients in CIGSe thin films significantly increases the value of Wd. A strong back gradient in sample B has a maximum Wd of 0.544 μm, whereas a weak back gradient in sample D has a minimum Wd of 0.280 μm in gradient films. However, CIGSe samples with a wider depletion width have a lower charge density, and this is consistent with previous reports.42–45 Because of this trade-off, the best device efficiency was achieved in sample C. Combined with SIMS results, it can be concluded that the notch positions in samples B (Wd = 0.544 μm and ΔLf = 80 nm) and C (Wd = 0.358 μm and ΔLf = 200 nm) are located in the SCR, and so there is a lower barrier for electron transport, which indicates that the back-gradients have a positive effect on Jsc improvement. However, in sample D (Wd = 0.280 μm and ΔLf = 440 nm), it can be concluded that the front-gradient starts from the QNR, and the large barrier of front-gradient will have a negative effect on Jsc improvement.

3 Conclusions
In conclusion, we have presented and implemented several new Ga gradient designs for CIGSe solar cells that demonstrably improve Jsc by ∼17% and achieve a maximum improvement in CIGSe efficiency (to 13.12%). Our approach involves narrowing the efficiency gap between hydrazine and non-hydrazine solution-based CIGSe solar cells, and it is believed that this approach is an effective method for pursuing the record efficiency of vacuum-based CIGSe solar cells. In this study, the location and depth of the notch in the Ga gradients are found to play key roles in device performances. When ΔLf was limited to values of about 200 nm, we obtained relatively high Voc and Jsc, and the recombination in the SCR and QNR was minimized. In addition to the relative proportions of the four stages, sintering temperature, and deposition rates, it was observed that the selenization temperature and time during CIGSe growth are crucial for determining the grading profile. Thus, we believe that further improvement for achieving even higher efficiencies requires extensive systematic investigations to optimize the Ga grading profiles, processing conditions, and all of the layers involved in the devices.
