    , Accepted 21st January 2008First published on 8th February 2008AbstractSidewall functionalization of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) via the Heck cross-coupling reaction of pre-functionalized p-iodophenyl SWNTs allows the covalent binding of different groups such as alkyl chains, dialkylamino or anthracenyl moieties. Functionalized SWNTs were characterized by a set of methods including 1H NMR, ATR-FTIR, XPS, UV/vis and Raman spectroscopic techniques. The degree of functionalization was estimated as 5.5 wt%. Laser flash photolysis studies comparing a covalently bonded anthracenyl derivative and mixtures of anthracene precursor and SWNTs revealed similarities between both systems (occurrence of photoinduced electron transfer, SWNT acting as electron acceptor) and differences (lifetimes of the charge separation), the charge separated state being much shorter lived for the system having covalent bonding with respect to the independent components.
Introduction
Since their discovery in 1991 by Ijima,1 single wall carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) have come to represent one of the most beautiful and interesting classes of nanostructured materials developed during the past decade. They have attracted enormous attention because of their remarkable structural, mechanical, electrical, thermal, and optical properties2 and have been demonstrated to be suitable for an impressively diverse range of applications including polymer composites,3 energy conversion4 and biological applications.5 However, their low solubility in common solvents has imposed large limitations on the applications of SWNTs.
Many applications using SWNTs require chemical modification of the carbon nanotubes to make them soluble for easier manipulation or to modulate their electronic properties by the placement of an array of functional groups onto SWNT surfaces. Whereas fullerenes have a well-established addition chemistry,6 the chemistry of SWNTs is currently a topic of much interest.7 Accordingly, the development of chemical strategies for SWNT sidewall functionalization has been an important issue for several groups during the last decade.8 Contributing to this field, our group have described the first examples of the Diels–Alder cycloaddition9 and the 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of nitrile imines10 and nitrile oxides11 to SWNTs.
The Heck reaction represents a versatile and powerful tool in synthetic organic chemistry.12 One of the most remarkable examples is the iterative use of the Heck reaction for the construction of conjugated oligomers as p-phenylenevinylenes (OPVs),13 compounds of great potential in materials research as organic light-emitting displays (OLEDs),14 field-effect transistors (FETs)15 and organic solar cells.16
However, the Heck reaction has not been explored on SWNT surfaces and, to the best of our knowledge, only one example of a Pd cross-coupling reaction on carbon nanotubes surface has been reported so far. Although in our work the SWNT walls themselves are not directly participating in the coupling, the fact that haloaryl pre-functionalized SWNTs can act as reagents in the Heck reaction with high efficiency widens considerably the possibility for synthesizing complex entities derived from SWNTs.17
Herein, we investigate the systematic application of the Heck reaction on iodophenyl pre-functionalized SWNTs with several acrylates carrying different functional groups and units resulting in covalently connected SWNT–spacer–acrylates carrying alkyl, alkylamino or anthracenyl moieties. In addition, photophysical studies on SWNT–spacer–anthraceneSWNT 3c were performed to study the influence of the SWNT on the photochemical properties of the anthracenyl moiety.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
The initial p-iodophenyl functionalized SWNT 1 was prepared from SWNTs obtained by catalytic chemical vapor deposition (purchased from Nanocyl, approximately several microns in length, and 2 nm in diameter) and p-iodoaniline in an inert atmosphere according to the procedure described by Dyke and Tour.18 Functionalized SWNT 1 was characterized by ATR-FTIR, Raman and UV/vis spectroscopic tecniques whose data are coincident with those from Tour (Scheme 1). Heck coupling of SWNT 1 and acrylates 2a–c with different functionalizations were performed using palladium acetate(II) and tri(o-tolyl) phosphine as the catalyst in the presence of triethylamine (Scheme 1). These reactions were carried out in dimethylformamide (DMF) at 100 °C for 48 hours, yielding functionalized SWNT products 3a–c The resulting paste was washed with methanol, sonicated and centrifuged. The collected solid was solubilized with CH2Cl2, sonicated for 5 min, centrifuged and filtered through a PTFE (450 nm pore size) to remove unreacted SWNT 1. Finally, the solvent was evaporated from the solution and the obtained solid dried overnight.

Photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) has been used to identify and quantify the functional groups anchored to the surface of SWNTs.19 and we employed this technique for the characterization of SWNT 1 and SWNT 3a–c. Due to the high sensitivity of the technique and the much greater inelastic mean free path of photoelectrons (3–4 nm) than the wall thickness of SWNTs other absorbed impurities and/or contaminants are precluded. In other words, XPS photoelectrons will probe the entire SWNT film, serving as a tool for chemical analysis in addition to providing information about the binding state of the elements. As illustration of the elemental composition, Fig. 1 displays the survey spectrum of SWNT 3a. Carbon is the major element, followed oxygen, with only traces of silicon. Similar survey spectra were recorded for SWNT 3b, SWNT 3c and SWNT 1 samples (see ESI‡ Fig. S1–S3). C 1s and O 1s peaks were present in all SWNT 3 samples but in no case was an I 3d peak found. In addition, SWNT 3b displayed, as expected, a weak N 1s peak. All these data support the incorporation of the different acrylates 2a–c on the nanotube surface.
 Fig. 1  Survey photoelectron spectrum of SWNT 3a. 

          C 1s, O 1s and N 1s core-level spectra of SWNT 3b are displayed in Fig. 2a–c. All the peaks were decomposed in several symmetrical components: three for C 1s and two for O 1s. The C 1s peaks were satisfactorily fitted to three components (Fig. 2a) according to the peak assignment used by Hiuraet al.20
 Fig. 2  High resolution core level spectra of SWNT samples: C 1s (a), O 1s (b) and N 1s (c) of SWNT 3b and I 3d (d) of SWNT 1. 
The most intense peak at 284.8 eV is unambiguously assigned to sp2 C–C bonds of graphitic carbon. The long shoulder of the main component was fitted to two peaks at ca. 286.2 and ca. 288.5 eV in the other samples. The component at ca. 286.2 eV has been often assigned to C–O and that at 288.0–288.5 eV to carboxyl carbon –COO species.21,22 It is also emphasized that the C 1s profiles did not show a broad, weak component around 291.3 eV, which comes from the π → π* transition of carbon atoms in graphene structures.21–23 This feature may be indicative of the presence of some surface defects and/or amorphous material. Similarly, the O 1s spectra have been fitted to two components (Fig. 2b). A first component at 532.3–532.4 eV corresponds to OC surface groups and a second one at 533.5–533.6 eV is associated to O–C bonds. In addition, SWNT 3b displays a symmetric N 1s profile at a binding energy of 400.1 eV which belongs to N atoms bonded to alkyl chains (Fig. 2c).24 It can also be noted that the original SWNT 1 sample (see Fig. 2d) shows the characteristic I 3d doublet whose main I 3d5/2 peak appears at 620.9 eV associated to covalently bonded iodine in C–I linkages.24
Atomic percentages derived from XP spectra for all samples are summarized in Table 1. In all samples, carbon percentages are in the range 82.0–88.6, the rest being oxygen with only a small contribution of iodine (2.4 in SWNT 1) or nitrogen (1.3 in SWNT 3b). On looking at the oxygen percentages, it is evident that the oxygen loading in SWNT 3a–c samples is substantially higher (15.1–16.7%) than in their SWNT 1 counterpart (9.0%). As the SWNT 3a–c samples were functionalized by anchoring –COO-containing molecules, the oxygen excess in SWNT 3a–c samples comes from these –COO– groups linked to the surface. Finally, it is noted that the contribution of carbon in SWNT 3c is slightly larger than in the other samples, suggesting the incorporation of the anthracenyl moiety onto the surface of SWNT. This result is consistent with UV spectra which showed, after correcting for the SWNT absorption, an amount of anthracene incorporated of 0.2 mmol per g of SWNT.

Due to the good solubility in CH2Cl2 and CHCl3 of the derivatives SWNT 3a–c, we were able to record their solution 1H NMR spectra. 1H NMR spectroscopy is a technique scarcely used in chemical functionalization of carbon nanotubes due to the inhomogenity and the low solubility of the samples; nevertheless, several authors have demonstrated the utility of this technique for the characterization of these materials.19,25 In our case, the comparison of the spectra of SWNT 3a–c with those of the acrylate precursors 2a–c shows analogies of the corresponding signal patterns, and, in all cases, compared to the spectra of 2a–c, the corresponding resonances of SWNT 3a–c are considerably broadened. As an example, the 1H NMR spectrum of SWNT 3a in CDCl3 (Fig. 3) shows the expected signal corresponding to COOCH2 as a broad peak at about 4.3 ppm; and together with the aromatic hydrogens, two broad signals assigned to the vinyl hydrogens (6.8 and 7.6 ppm) are observed, confirming the incorporation of the acrylate moiety in the p-iodophenylfunctionalizedSWNT 1. Similarly, the 1H NMR spectra of SWNT 3b and SWNT 3c show the presence of the expected signals (see ESI, †Fig. S4 and S5, respectively).

ATR-FTIR spectroscopy provided information about the structures appended to the surface of the SWNTs. The spectra of SWNT 3a–c (Fig. 4) indicate the presence of the functional addends: all compounds shows peaks at 2915 and 2854 cm−1, which are due to the C–H stretch modes in the alkyl chains, and the peaks at around 1727 cm−1 correspond to the ester groups.

Transmission UV/vis spectra of diluted acetonitrile solutions of SWNT 3a–c showed bands corresponding to the aromatic p-cinnamyl chromophore located at the walls at 290 nm (Fig. 5). For compound SWNT 3c this 290 nm absorption is accompanied by the typical structured anthracenyl band between 320 and 380 nm. These bands corresponding to the sidewall substituents appearing on top of a continuous absorption growing towards shorter wavelengths characteristic of SWNTs (Fig. 5). It is interesting to note that the van Hove singularities characteristic of many SWNTs typically appearing in the NIR region were not observed in our samples. This fact may be a reflection of the short length of the sample of SWNTs produced by us (vide infra for TEM images).

Raman spectroscopy is a technique often used for the characterization of single wall carbon nanotubes. Three peaks at about 1610, 1380 and 200 cm−1 corresponding to the tangential, defect and radial vibration modes, respectively, were recorded for most the samples (Fig. 6). Particularly important is the observation in SWNT 1 and SWNT 3a of the low-intensity radial breathing mode bands, confirming that the single wall structure of the nanotubes has been preserved in the pre-functionalization process. Also worth nothing is the relative increase of the intensity of the 1380 cm−1 band with respect to that of 1610 cm−1, which is a reflection of the side wall functionalization.26,27 In the case of SWNT 3c bearing anthracenyl units the signal to noise ratio of the Raman spectra was significantly low (Fig. 6c). This fact can be attributed to the intense fluorescence derived from the anthracenyl fluorophore.

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of SWNT 3a–c confirmed that the morphology of the SWNTs has been preserved in the functionalization process. The average length of series of functionalized SWNTs was estimated from this image as 100 nm. This short length is one of the main reasons for the excellent solubility of the samples in most organic solvents. The diameter of the nanotubes was about 12 nm, which is significantly wider than that of the starting CCVD SWNTs. It could be that the increase of diameter reflects some agglomeration under the conditions in which the TEM image was recorded or the increase in the effective diameter of the nanotubes as consequence of the sidewall functionalization (Fig. 7).

Photophysical studies of anthracenyl derivative SWNT 3c

Anthracene and its derivatives have been favourite photochemical probes and a wealth of information is available concerning characterization and lifetime of their electronic excited states and reactive intermediates derived therefrom.28 In accordance with the presence of anthracenyl units in the carbon nanotubes, SWNT 3c exhibits a structured emission, mirroring the absorption spectrum, with relative intensity maxima at 393, 417 and 438 nm. Fig. 8 shows the emission and excitation spectra recorded for a solution of SWNT 3c in acetonitrile. Unfortunately, emission quantum yield measurements cannot be reliably determined since for optically matched solutions of SWNT 3c and precursor 2c, there is a significant contribution of SWNTs to the absorption. As mentioned earlier, SWNT absorbs in the complete UV/vis region with increasing absorptivity towards shorter wavelength. Therefore, for the anthracenyl loading bonded to the SWNTs, and considering that the total absorbance at 350 nm (the excitation wavelength) consists of the additive contribution to the absorbance due to 2c and SWNT, it is estimated that about 60–70% of the light is absorbed by the SWNT. This large interference of SWNT moieties in the measurements makes uncertain any quantum yield determination at 350 nm.
 Fig. 8  Emission (Em, excitation at 350 nm) and excitation (Ex, monitoring at 425 nm) spectra of SWNT 3c in acetonitrile (0.5 mg ml−1). The inset shows the temporal profile of the emission (a) compared with the time resolution of the setup (b). 
Concerning the kinetics of the emission, a reasonable proposal based on precedents29 on the photophysics of fluorophores covalently bonded to SWNT is that the fraction of 2c units strongly associated to the nanotubes does not emit at all, while the remaining population of 2c bonded to carbon nanotubes but not interacting with the nanotube walls emit with the same kinetics as the non-bonded chromophore. In other words, emission quenching, if it occurs, will be purely static without any dynamic component. Thus, the emission, or lack thereof, of each individual 2cchromophore depends on the interaction with the SWNT walls prior to photochemical excitation.
In agreement with the precedents about the occurrence of static quenching, the temporal profile of the emission for SWNT 3c followed a clean first order kinetics with a half life of 3.7 ns. This value coincides exactly with the half life of the anthracenyl precursor, indicating that the emitting anthracenyl units attached to the nanotubes are not influenced by the interaction with the walls of carbon nanotubes.
More informative with respect to the interaction between anthracenyl units and the SWNT were the laser flash photolysis experiments. In accordance with the well known photochemistry of anthracene compounds,30 laser flash excitation of anthracene precursor 2c in acetonitrile solution allowed the detection of a transient species characterised by a sharp absorption peak at 420 nm decaying in the microsecond time scale (τ = 38.80 μs), Fig. 9. This transient was quenched by oxygen and can be safely assigned to the triplet excited state of the anthracenyl precursor.
 Fig. 9  Transient spectra recorded 3.04 (■) and 18.40 μs (●) after 355 nm excitation of a N2-purged 28 μM solution of precursor 2c in acetonitrile. The inset shows the Stern–Volmer plot of 2c triplet quenching as a function of the SWNT concentration. 
Addition of increasing amounts of soluble SWNTs to 2c precursor solutions produce remarkable changes in the transient spectrum and the temporal profile. Fig. 10 shows the time resolved spectra recorded for a solution of anthracenyl precursor 2c in the presence of soluble SWNTs. As can be seen, in the presence of SWNTs the peak at 420 nm is still present but there is also a continuous absorption expanding from 430–750 nm that was not observed in their absence. On top of this broad absorption there is the typical structured band peaking at 680, 700, 710 nm characteristic of the presence of the anthracenyl radical cation (ANT˙+). In view of the presence of ANT˙+, we propose that the broad absorption from 430–750 nm must correspond to the electron on the SWNT. Scheme 2 describes the mechanistic proposal. In this regard, considering the absence in the UV/vis region of characteristic bands that could be used to identify safely electrons in SWNTs, recent reports have described that the temporal variations in the van Hove singularities can be taken as a fingerprint for the occurrence of photoinduced electron transfer involving SWNTs.31 However, since the NIR region is not accessible with conventional photomultipliers and our short, soluble SWNT samples do not exhibit van Hove singularities in optical spectroscopy, it would be necessary in our case to check independently the validity of this approach.

 Scheme 2  Mechanism proposed for the quenching of 2c triplets by SWNT after 355 nm laser excitation. 
The kinetics of the anthracene triplet excited state (ANT3) also reveals the quenching of 2c triplets by SWNT. Applying the Stern–Volmer formalism (see inset of Fig. 9), a quenching constant of 116.91 mg s−1 was estimated. Fig. 11 shows the variations of the temporal profile of the signal corresponding to ANT3 as a function of increasing concentration of SWNTs. As can be seen, in addition to remarkable variations in the lifetime, a decrease in the peak ΔOD of the signal was also observed. This suggests some static quenching component is taking place simultaneously to dynamic quenching. We note that, at the SWNT concentrations used, the laser absorption by SWNTs should be minor compared to light absorption of compound 2c.
 Fig. 11  Quenching of 2c triplet state upon increasing the SWNT concentration from 0 to 0.009 mg m−1. 
With these previous studies of the quenching of 2c triplets by independent SWNT, we proceeded to perform the laser flash photolysis of SWNT 3c. The main difference between the quenching experiments of 2c by SWNT and measurements with SWNT 3c is that in the quenching experiments there is no covalent bond between the two components in contrast to the situation of SWNT 3c. Also another important difference is the relative proportion of 2c and SWNT moieties, in the quenching experiments and in SWNT 3c the 2c/SWNT ratios are different (2c loading in SWNT 3c is 5.5 wt% determined by UV/vis spectroscopy). Nevertheless, we expected that the photochemical behaviour of SWNT 3c would have common patterns with that of 2c in the presence of SWNTs with some differences arising from the specific features previously commented upon. In fact laser flash photolysis of a 0.09 mg ml−1 solution of SWNT 3c exhibits immediately after the laser pulse a broad absorption from 430 to 800 nm on top of which a peak at 420 nm and a structured band at 690–710 nm were also observed. Based on the previous transient spectra recorded for the 2c precursor in the absence and presence of SWNTs, we assign the broad absorption to electrons delocalised on the nanotubes, the sharp peak at 420 nm to localised excitons on the 2c moiety and the band at 710 nm to holes localised on 2c moieties. Fig. 12 shows the transient spectra recorded for SWNT 3c at different delay times after the laser flash.
 Fig. 12  Transient spectra recorded 2.56 (●), 8.8 (▲) and 25.12 μs (▼) after laser excitation of a 0.09 mg ml−1 N2-purged acetonitrile solution of SWNT 3c. 
The spectrum changes over the time elapsed after the laser flash. Thus, as Fig. 12 shows, 8.8 μs after the laser pulse the broad absorption characteristic of electrons in nanotubes and the band of the 2c˙+ hole localised on the 2c moiety (peaks in the 680–750 nm zone) have completely disappeared and only the peak at 420 nm characteristic of the triplet exciton localized on the 2c subunit remains. The most remarkable features arising from the comparison between 2c quenching by SWNTs and SWNT 3c is the short lifetime of the charge separated state for SWNT 3c and the presence in SWNT 3c of a significant residual population of triplet excitons localised on the 2c units. Thus, the covalent bond significantly shortens the lifetime of the charge separated state as compared to the situation in which the individual compounds are not bonded. Probably, the more rigid co-conformation between ANT and SWNT when there is a covalent bond favours orbital overlapping promoting back electron transfer. The same explanation based on the lack of conformational mobility serves to justify that some triplet localised on ANTs situated in an unfavourable disposition for interaction with the nanotube walls can survive over much longer periods in SWNT 3c than in the quenching experiments of the 2c triplet excited state by SWNTs.
In order to enhance the lifetime of charge separation, we added to the acetonitrile solution of SWNT 3cmethyl viologen (MV2+). MV2+ is a good electron acceptor32 and it is anticipated that the electrons will migrate from SWNT to MV2+ to generate the corresponding radical cation. MV2+ radical cation is a long lived species that can be easily characterised in optical spectroscopy by the corresponding absorption spectrum consisting of a sharp peak at 390 nm, with a shoulder on the shorter wavelength band side, accompanied by a broad, less intense and structured band from 500 to 700 nm.3 As anticipated laser flash photolysis of SWNT 3c in the presence of MV2+ gives rise to the transient spectrum (Fig. 13), consisting of bands compatible with the presence of 2c˙+, MV˙+ and a residual population of 2c˙+ triplets.
 Fig. 13  Transient spectra recorded 3 (●) and 167 μs (▼) after 355 nm laser excitation of a 0.09 mg ml−1 N2-purged acetonitrile solution of SWNT 3c after adding 0.3 mL of MV2+ (0.46 mg m−1). The inset shows the signal decay monitored at 600 nm. 
Importantly under these circumstances the lifetime of the SWNT 3c/MV˙+ charge separation was remarkably long and the transient did not completely decay after 0.2 ms, the longest time scale available in our experiments.
In addition to adding MV2+ as electron acceptor, we also perfomed the laser excitation of SWNT 3c in the presence of triethanolamine (TEA) as electron donor. TEA should quench the radical cations of the anthracenyl units and should leave the transient spectrum corresponding to the electron located at the SWNTs. We notice that electron donors would also quench anthracenyl triplet excited states and, by quenching both signals from the anthracenyl unit, should leave the transient spectrum corresponding to the electrons localized at SWNTs. Fig. 14 shows the transient spectra recorded upon photoexcitation of SWNT 3c in the presence of 2 × 10−4 M of TEA. The inset of Fig. 14 shows the temporal profile of the signal monitored at 420 nm in the absence and presence of TEA. The signal in the absence of TEA corresponds to the triplet excited state localized on the anthracenyl unit, while after addition of TEA the different temporal profile corresponds to the residual transient absorption of the reduced SWNT.

The inset shows the temporal profile of the signal monitored at 420 nm in the absence (top trace) and in the presence (bottom trace) of TEA. 
Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated that Heck coupling reactions represent an efficient method for the incorporation of different moieties onto carbon nanotube surfaces. A comprehensive characterization of all synthesized compounds was carried out by the combination of a wide range of spectroscopic methods. Concerning the photochemistry of the anthracenyl derivative SWNT 3c and taking all the data together, we have observed that 2c covalently bonded to the walls of the carbon nanotubes undergoes upon light excitation charge separation and generation of a triplet excited state. The charge separated state is short-lived and decays completely in less than 10 μs after the laser flash. The same phenomenon, although with remarkable differences in lifetime, also occurs upon the quenching of 2c˙+ precursor with independent SWNTs. Thus, the covalent linkage does not introduce new photochemical processes but only modulates the strength and life of the photogenerated transients, that are equally observed when there is no covalent bond.
Experimental
General
All solvents and reagents were purchased from Aldrich and used as received without further purification, unless otherwise mentioned. Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs), prepared by a CCVD process, were purchased from Nanocyl (http://www.nanocyl.com). 1H NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker 400 spectrometer and a Varian Mercury 200 spectrometer. IR spectra were recorded on an AVATAR 370 FT-IR Thermo Nicolet using ATR (attenuated total reflection). Ultrasonication was performed in a Ultrasons bath sonicator. Filtration was done through a PTFE (450 nm pore diameter) membrane.

Photoelectron spectra (XPS) were obtained with a VG Escalab 200R spectrometer equipped with a hemispherical electron analyser (pass energy of 50 eV) and a MgKα (hν = 1254.6 eV, 1 eV = 1.6302 × 10−19 J) X-ray source, powered at 120 W. The kinetic energies of photoelectrons were measured using a hemispherical electron analyser working in the constant pass energy mode. The background pressure in the analysis chamber was kept below 2 × 10−8 mbar during data acquisition. The XPS data signals were taken in increments of 0.1 eV with dwell times of 50 ms. Binding energies were calibrated relative to the C 1s peak at 284.6 eV. High resolution spectra envelopes were obtained by curve fitting synthetic peak components using the software “XPS peak”. The raw data were used with no preliminary smoothing. Symmetric Gaussian–Lorentzian product functions were used to approximate the line shapes of the fitting components. Atomic ratios were computed from experimental intensity ratios and normalized by atomic sensitivity factors.33

Raman spectra were recorded at room temperature in the ambient atmosphere using a Renishaw in Via Microscope with a diode laser (785 nm) and averaging 10 scans of different areas of the black solid. Photoluminescence measurements were performed in acetonitrile solution at room temperature in N2-purged septum-capped quartz cells using an Edinburgh FL3000 spectrofluorometer, a Xe-doped mercury lamp and a Czerny-Turner monochromator. Laser flash photolysis experiments were carried out using the third (355 nm) harmonic of a Q-switched Nd:YAG laser (Spectron Laser Systems, UK; pulse width ca. 9 ns and 35 mJ pulse−1). The signal from the monochromator/photomultiplier detection system was captured by a Tektronix TDS640A digitizer and transferred to a PC that controlled the experiment and provided suitable processing and data storage capabilities.
Preparation of p-iodophenylfunctionalized SWNTs 117
SWNTs 1 were prepared according to a previously published procedure,17 modifying the ratio between the initial pure SWNT and 4-iodoaniline. So, pure SWNTs (100 mg) and 4-iodoaniline (15 g, 64 mmol) were added to a flask equipped with a reflux condenser and a magnetic stir bar. The flask was degassed and backfilled with argon. The mixture was stirred and heated to 65 °C to allow 4-iodoaniline to completely melt and mix well with the SWNTs. Subsequently, isoamyl nitrite (20 ml, 149 mmol) was added slowly via syringe. The mixture was then stirred vigorously at 60 °C for 3 h. The resulting paste was diluted with DMF and filtered through a PTFE (450 nm pore diameter) membrane. The collected solid was then taken up in DMF (100 ml) and sonicated (20 min), washed until the filtrate was colorless (6 times). The solid was finally washed with diethyl ether (100 ml), and was dried in a vacuum oven (55 °C) overnight yielding 181 mg of SWNT 1.
Heck cross-coupling on the SWNT surface

Syntheses of SWNT 3a. 
A 50 ml flask was charged under argon with p-iodophenylfunctionalized SWNTs 1 (30 mg) and DMF (30 ml). After sonicating for 10 min at room temperature a black suspension was formed. Butyl acrylate 2a (5 ml), triethylamine (1 ml), tri(o-tolyl)phosphine (24 mg) and palladium(II) acetate (6 mg) were added and the reaction mixture was stirred at 100 °C under argon for 48 h. After cooling to room temperature, the solvent was removed under reduced pressure. Then, the resulting paste was washed thoroughly with 100 ml of methanol, bath sonicated for 5 min and centrifuged. The collected solid was extracted with dichloromethane (250 ml), bath sonicated for 5 min, centrifuged and filtered through a PTFE (450 nm pore diameter) membrane (2 times). Finally, the combined extracted filtrates were evaporated and the solid obtained was dried in a vacuum oven (60 °C) overnight to yield 3a.
This procedure for Heck coupling was identically applied to the reactions of SWNT 1 and (diethylamino)ethyl acrylate 2b and 9-anthracenylmethyl acrylate 2c.
