    , Accepted 21st February 2011First published on 17th March 2011AbstractThe photoelectrochemical (PEC) activity of untreated (not anodized) and anodized nanotubular TiO2 films (synthesized by the electrochemical anodization of Ti foil) was correlated with the phase composition of the film as a function of O2-annealing temperature at 400, 500 and 600 °C. TiO2 nanotubes have been shown to be more efficient than polycrystalline TiO2 for the photocatalytic splitting of water. Raman spectroscopy was used to identify the amorphous and crystalline TiO2 phases as well as the carbon species. The amorphous TiO2 nanotubular array (unheated) exhibits a Raman spectrum consistent with TiO68− octahedra having the same average structure as those present in the anatase and rutile phases of TiO2. Ratios of integrated Raman peaks were used as a semi-quantitative measure of the degree of crystallinity for rutile and the rutile/anatase weight ratio in the films. Results show that the anatase-to-rutile transformation on Ti metal initiates at much lower temperatures compared to polycrystalline TiO2 and this is attributed to oxygen vacancies located at the metal/oxide interface. For untreated films, the amorphous TiO2 crystallizes directly to rutile, and the photocurrent density increases almost linearly with rutile crystallinity as the O2-annealing temperature is increased; anatase does not form on untreated O2-annealed Ti foil. By comparison, amorphous TiO2 nanotubular arrays are converted to about three times as much anatase as rutile at 400 °C, where the photocurrent density is only slightly greater than the corresponding untreated film. At 500 °C, however, the photocurrent density increases to 2.3× that of the untreated-oxidized film, where ∼83% of the TiO2 nanotubular film is rutile and ∼17% is anatase; this enhancement is attributed to the increase in surface area and photoactive sites of the rutile provided by the TiO2 nanotubular array architecture acting as a support. At 600 °C the rutile transformation continues (∼92% rutile), but this is countered by the significant loss of surface area and surface photoactive sites due to degradation and collapse of the nanotubular structure as seen by SEM.
Introduction

        Titanium dioxide, TiO2, has been investigated for a wide variety of technologies including self-cleaning and anti-bacterial coatings,1 energy storage,2 photocatalysis,3decomposition of organic environmental wastes,4 solar energy conversion,5–7 and as a water-splitting catalyst for generating hydrogen fuel from water.8 In fact, titanium dioxide has been one of the most widely studied photocatalytic semiconducting materials since the early 1970s when Fujishima and Honda9 demonstrated the splitting of water into H2 and O2 using a simple photoelectrochemical cell and illuminating a single-crystal TiO2 photoanode (anatase) with UV light of wavelength less than 350 nm.
There are several favorable attributes of TiO2 as a promising semiconducting photoanode material for water splitting using solar radiation. In addition to its low cost and availability, TiO2 is chemically and photochemically stable and its band edges match the redox level of water.10–12 It is recognized that semiconductor properties such as band gap, flat band potential, and stability must be simultaneously optimized.13,14 Yet the most important requirement of a photocatalyst is its ability to generate electron–hole pairs (e− h+) near the catalyst surface by harvesting a significant portion of the solar spectrum. Unfortunately, the use of TiO2 is hindered by its large band gap which allows photoconversion of only UV radiation (4–7% of the solar spectrum)—the band gap must necessarily be decreased if TiO2 is to be used for visible light applications. Much of the research to date on TiO2-based water-splitting catalysts has focused on narrowing the band gap by incorporating dopants into the lattice structure,15–19 but with only secondary regard to the actual phase composition of the TiO2 which is likely to have a significant impact on photoelectrochemical (PEC) performance.
The three most common crystalline phases of TiO2 are anatase (tetragonal), rutile (tetragonal) and brookite (orthorhombic).20Anatase and rutile are the most suitable for photochemical applications of TiO2 while amorphous TiO2 displays little or no photoactivity. Although rutile is more thermodynamically stable and exhibits a lower band gap than anatase (3.0 eV for rutile; 3.2 eV for anatase21), anatase is preferred for photocatalysis22 and is the most commonly used crystalline phase of TiO2 for photochemical applications.23 Consequently, the photoactivity of the TiO2 film is significantly affected not only by the architecture of the TiO2 (whether it is single-crystal, polycrystalline, or nanotubular), but by whether the film is composed of amorphous titania, anatase, rutile, or a mixture of these phases.
The transformation of amorphous TiO2 to either anatase or rutile, and the temperature at which anatase is converted to rutile, depend on many variables including the method of synthesis, the presence of foreign ions, crystallite size (decreasing size stabilizes anatase),24 and the composition of the annealing gas.25 It has been suggested26 that impurities or conditions which increase the number of oxygen vacancies increase the rate of rutile formation. For example, the reduction of TiO2 by hydrogen results in a color change from yellow to blue, consistent with reduction of the Ti4+ to Ti3+, which introduces anion vacancies in order to maintain electroneutrality. It was proposed that reducing atmospheres enable easier rupturing of Ti–O bonds in the anatase structure by the introduction of oxygen vacancies, allowing rearrangement of the octahedra which leads to a smaller volume and rutile formation at lower annealing temperatures. Annealing in vacuum, on the other hand, retards the anatase-to-rutile transformation because titanium interstitials are created rather than oxygen vacancies.25 Increasing the partial pressure of oxygen in the annealing gas oxidizes surface vacancies and slows the rate of formation of rutile. It was reported, however, that TiO2 nanotubular arrays annealed at 500 °C in reducing gases N2 or 5% H2/Ar showed poorly crystallized anatase with very little rutile.27
Although single-crystal TiO2 photoactively splits water, polycrystalline TiO2 films are more practical considering the economics of eventual large-scale production.28 Unfortunately, polycrystalline films contain a large number of grain boundaries that adversely affect photoconversion efficiency. To address this problem, TiO2 nanotubes have been investigated for the photocatalytic splitting of water into hydrogen and oxygen using solar light. The increased efficiency of electron transport observed for TiO2 nanotubes is attributed to the more ordered arrangement of the nanotubular arrays.29
In this study, nanotubular TiO2 films were synthesized by the electrochemical anodization of Ti foil in an ethylene glycol (5 wt% NH4F) electrolyte and annealed in pure oxygen at 400, 500 and 600 °C. The photoelectrochemical (PEC) activity of the O2-annealed TiO2 nanotubes was measured for the water-splitting reaction and correlated with chemical phases present within the TiO2 film. Photocurrent densities were measured for both anodized (nanotubular TiO2 arrays) and untreated (not anodized) Ti foil samples as a function of O2-annealing temperature. Raman spectroscopy was used to identify and semi-quantify relative amounts of amorphous TiO2, crystalline TiO2 (anatase and rutile), and carbon phases present in the films.
Experimental
Electrochemical synthesis of TiO2 nanotubular arrays

          TiO2 (titania) nanotubular films, considered ideal for photo-electrolysis,30 were synthesized on the titanium metal foil support (99.9% pure, 0.5 mm thick) using a conventional anodization process (95 wt% ethylene glycol + 5 wt% NH4F; 20 V, 1 A, 1 h). As noted from recent studies, the addition of a small amount of water to the ethylene glycol electrolyte is critical since water is the usual source of oxygen in polar organic electrolytes.31,32 A two-electrode configuration was used for anodization. A platinum electrode (thickness: 1 mm; area: 3.75 cm2) served as a cathode. The distance between the two electrodes was kept at 4.5 cm in all the experiments. Anodization was carried out at a constant potential of 20 V using a DC voltage supply (Agilent, E3640A). The anodization current was monitored continuously using a digital multimeter (METEX, MXD 4600 A). After an initial increase–decrease transient, the current reached a steady-state value. The anodized samples were washed with distilled water to remove the occluded ions from the anodizing solutions and dried in an air-oven.

          Oxygen
          annealing

The anodized and untreated Ti foil samples were annealed in an oxygen atmosphere at 400–600 °C for 6 h in a tube furnace to convert the amorphous titania to the crystalline anatase and/or rutile forms of TiO2.
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) characterization
Photocurrent densities were measured for both the anodized and untreated (not anodized) samples as a function of oxygen annealing temperature. Current versus potential measurements were performed using a Perkin-Elmer Model 283 Potentiostat/Galvanostat (EG&G Instruments Corp.) and typical three-electrode electrochemical cell (Pt-wire counter electrode, saturated Ag/AgCl reference electrode). PEC studies were performed using a glass cell with separate compartments for the photoanode (nanotubular TiO2 specimen) and the cathode (Pt wire). The compartments were connected by a fine porous glass frit. A reference electrode (Ag/AgCl) was placed closer to the anode using a salt-bridge (saturated KCl)–Luggin probe capillary. The cell was provided with a 60 mm diameter quartz window for light incidence. A 300 W solar simulator (Model: 69911, Newport-Oriel Instruments, Stratford, CT, USA) was used as a light source. The electrolyte used was 1 M KOH (pH ∼14) aqueous solution. The electrolyte was prepared using reagent grade chemicals and double-distilled water. No aeration was carried out to purge out the dissolved gases in the electrolyte. A potentiostat interfaced with a computer and software (Model: PC3/CMS 100, Gamry Instruments Inc., Warminster, PA, USA) was employed to control the potential and record the photocurrent. The samples were anodically polarized from the open circuit potential until 0.5 V at a scan-rate of 5 mV s−1 under illumination and the photocurrent was recorded.

Raman spectroscopy


Raman spectra of all TiO2 films were collected using a LabRam Micro-Raman Spectrometer (Horiba Jobin-Yvon HR800 UV) equipped with an optical microscope and 100× objective lens for a total magnification of 1000×. An argon-ion laser (514.5 nm) or helium–neon laser (632.8 nm) was used for excitation of the Raman signal with appropriate holographic notch filters for eliminating the laser line after excitation. The laser power at the sample ranged from 1 to 3 mW, and the 1/e laser spot size was about 2 µm at the sample. The slit width of the spectrometer was typically set at 700 µm. A holographic grating having 1800 grooves mm−1 was used for the collection of all Raman spectra and resulted in a spectral resolution of about 1.5 cm−1. Spectral analysis and curve fitting was performed with GRAMS/AI 8.00 Spectroscopy software.

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM)

          Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) images of the titania nanotubular films were obtained using a JEOL 7000FE. Images were collected at a series of magnifications ranging from 100× to 200000×.
Results and discussion
Photoelectrochemical characterization

Table 1 shows the photocurrents obtained from untreated (not anodized) Ti foil and anodized Ti foil, respectively, as a function of O2-annealing temperature (air-dried at 25 °C; annealed at 400, 500 or 600 °C for 6 h). The photocurrent density for the untreated Ti foil samples (not anodized) increased from 20 µA cm−2 for the as-purchased Ti foil to 49 µA cm−2 for the sample O2-annealed at 400 °C, 166 µA cm−2 for the sample O2-annealed at 500 °C, and 277 µA cm−2 for the sample O2-annealed at 600 °C.

For samples that were anodized (95 wt% ethylene glycol + 5 wt% NH4F; 20 V, 1 A, 1 h), the photocurrent increased from 20 µA cm−2 for the air-dried, room-temperature sample (control sample), 58 µA cm−2 for the sample O2-annealed at 400 °C, 379 µA cm−2 for the sample O2-annealed at 500 °C, and decreased slightly to 349 µA cm−2 for the sample O2-annealed at 600 °C. Table 1 shows that the O2-annealed anodized films exhibit higher photocurrent densities than films that were not anodized, or samples that were only anodized and not O2-annealed, consistent with recent work.18

          SEM images of the TiO2 nanotube arrays produced using the anodization process are shown in Fig. 1. The images indicate a highly uniform film, and the diameter of the TiO2 nanotubes ranges between 80 and 107 nm. The height of the nanotubes was 4 µm ± 10%.

Raman spectroscopy

The Raman spectra for the untreated Ti foil as a function of O2-annealing temperature are presented in Fig. 2. The major peaks at 610, 446, and 242 cm−1 and minor peaks at 818, 707, and 319 cm−1 are consistent with the presence of the rutile phase of TiO2. Based on the space groupD4h14 for rutile and assumed site symmetries for the Ti and O atoms within the unit cell, group-theoretical analysis shows four Raman-active “lattice vibrations” assigned as follows: A1g (610 cm−1) + B1g (144 cm−1) + B2g (827 cm−1) + Eg (446 cm−1).33 In the present study, we use bond length/Raman frequency/covalency correlations that have proven quite useful and accurate for many chemical systems;34,35 recent application to the titanates36 reveals that the reported Ti–O bond lengths of 4x 1.946 Å and 2x 1.984 Å for rutile37 are consistent with the observed Ti–O bands at 610, 571 (weak), 446 and 407 (weak) cm−1 which yield calculated Ti–O bond lengths of 3x 1.92, 1.96, 2.12 and 2.18 Å. The O–O interactions, based on residual valence, are calculated to occur in the 252–394 cm−1 region. The broad band observed near 160–240 cm−1 is assigned to O–O interactions involving three- and four-coordinate oxygen. The sharp feature at 143 cm−1 is consistent with Ti–Ti covalent interactions (2.96 Å; 0.29 valence units). These peaks are initially observed for the sample annealed at 400 °C and become sharper and more intense as the annealing temperature is increased indicating increased crystallinity of the rutile phase. The unheated Ti foil, for which the Raman spectrum is shown in Fig. 2(a), shows amorphous titania (native oxide) and exhibits broad bands near 680, 580 and 450 cm−1 assigned to Ti–O bonds (∼1.85, 1.95, and 2.11 Å); broad bands at 350 and 250 cm−1 are assigned to O–O interactions consistent with TiO68− octahedra that are slightly more distorted than those present in the rutile phase of TiO2.
 Fig. 2  
Raman spectra of untreated Ti foil (a) as purchased, and O2-annealed at (b) 400 °C, (c) 500 °C, and (d) 600 °C. 
In addition to TiO2 phases, Raman spectroscopy is also used to detect and identify carbon species. For the untreated TiO2 films, amorphous carbon is present in all the films as indicated by the characteristic bands near 1342 and 1601 cm−1 assigned to sp3- and sp2-hybridized carbon, respectively;38 these bands are similar to those observed for carbon black. Amorphous carbonate, CO32−, is also present in all untreated TiO2 films as indicated by the broad, but characteristic peak near 1100 cm−1. Upon O2-annealing at 400 and 500 °C, the Raman band due to carbonate remains, but those due to amorphous carbon are not observed. At 600 °C, the carbonate band almost disappears, and those due to amorphous carbon reappear.
The Raman spectra for the Ti foil samples that were anodized (95 wt% ethylene glycol + 5 wt% NH4F; 20 V, 1 A, 1 h) to produce TiO2 nanotubular arrays are presented in Fig. 3 as a function of O2-annealing temperature. The sample dried at room temperature, Fig. 3(a), shows broad peaks near 612 and 467 cm−1 due to amorphous titania. Using length/frequency/valence relationships, these broad bands are consistent with TiO68− octahedra having the same average structure as those present in both anatase and rutile phases of TiO2 with average calculated bond lengths of 5x 1.93 and 2.12 Å. The remaining peaks are decomposition products of the ethylene glycol anodization solution; the observed spectrum in Fig. 3(a) does not match that of the ethylene glycol electrolyte indicating decomposition of the ethylene glycol on the nanotubular surface. The peak near 1598 cm−1 is characteristic of sp2-hybridized carbon–carbon bonding, but is not due to amorphous carbon black because of the absence of the accompanying band near 1340 cm−1 due to the sp3-hybridized component. The peak at 1076 cm−1 is assigned to a carbonate species, CO32−; the excessive broadness of this band indicates an amorphous carbonate.

Annealing in oxygen at 400 °C for 6 h, Fig. 3(b), results in the formation of anatase as the dominant phase as well as a small amount of rutile. Anatase exhibits Raman bands at 635, 514, 396, and 197 cm−1, as well as a very sharp and intense peak at 144 cm−1. Based on the space group D4h19 for anatase and assumed site symmetries for the Ti and O atoms within the unit cell (D2d for Ti; C2v for O), group-theoretical analysis shows six Raman-active “lattice vibrations” assigned as follows: A1g (517 cm−1) + B1g (640 cm−1) + B1g (397 cm−1) + Eg (640 cm−1) + Eg (147 cm−1) + Eg (197 cm−1);39 the weak band at 796 cm−1 was assigned as the first overtone of the B1g mode. The reported crystallographic Ti–O bond lengths for bulk anatase are 4x 1.9338 Å and 2x 1.9797 Å.40 Covalence/length/frequency relations show that the observed Raman bands at 640, 517 and 397 cm−1 are consistent with the moderately distorted TiO68− octahedron in anatase (calculated Ti–O bond lengths: 2x 1.89, 3x 2.02 and 2.14 Å). The O–O covalent interactions are calculated near 246–351 cm−1. The sharp peaks at 197 and 144 cm−1 are consistent with Ti–Ti bonding present in the octahedral chains with reported Ti–Ti bond length of 2.96 Å (calculated: 2.89 and 2.96 Å, respectively). As the oxygen annealing temperature is increased from 400 to 600 °C, Fig. 3(b–d), the relative amount of rutile increases as evidenced by the relative intensity increase of the Raman bands at 612, 446 and 238 cm−1. For the anodized sample O2-annealed at 600 °C, Fig. 3(d), both anatase and rutile are present, with rutile being the dominant phase.
Untreated (not anodized) TiO2 films
As the crystallinity of the rutile phase of TiO2 increases, Fig. 2, the Raman bands become sharper (reduction in FWHM) and the relative intensity of the band at 446 cm−1 increases relative to the band at 610 cm−1. Consequently, the ratio of these integrated Raman peaks, I446/I610, serves as a measure of the degree of crystallinity for rutile.

Fig. 4 shows a plot of the ratio of integrated Raman peaks for rutile, I446/I610 as a function of measured photocurrent density for untreated (not anodized) TiO2 films. The ratio is expressed as percent rutile crystallinity by assuming that the TiO2 that was O2-annealed at 600 °C is fully (100%) crystalline; this result compares favorably with that obtained for bulk crystalline rutile. Also shown in Fig. 4 is the measured photocurrent density as a function of O2-annealing temperature. For the amorphous film (dried at room temperature), the results show only baseline photocurrent densities of 20 µA cm−2; there is no resolvable Raman band at 446 cm−1 and this corresponds to 0% crystallinity. At 400 °C, the photocurrent density increases to 49 µA cm−2 with the appearance of crystalline rutile corresponding to 37% crystallinity. The photocurrent density then increases almost linearly as the crystallinity (and amount) of rutile increases with increasing O2annealing temperature: 166 µA cm−2 at 500 °C with 65% crystallinity, and 277 µA cm−2 at 600 °C with 100% crystallinity.
 Fig. 4  Plot for untreated (not anodized) films showing the photocurrent density (PEC) versus increasing rutile crystallinity with increasing oxygen-annealing temperature. The rutile crystallinity is determined from the ratio of the integrated 446 and 610 cm−1 Raman peaks; the percent crystallinity is set at 100% for the film O2-annealed at 600 °C. The maximum photocurrent density occurs for the most crystalline TiO2-rutile sample. 
Anodized TiO2 films: nanotubular arrays
The ratio of the integrated Raman peak intensity of rutile at 446 cm−1 to that of anatase at 396 cm−1 may be used as a semi-quantitative measure of the weight ratio of rutile to anatase. The results of a recent Raman study41 investigating physical mixtures of crystalline anatase and rutile revealed the following approximate and linear relationship for the weight ratio of rutile to anatase: WR/A = 3.64 × (I446/I396). In the present study of TiO2 films, however, this relationship is at best semi-quantitative since the Raman scattering cross-sections of both anatase and rutile change as the degree of crystallinity changes.
The TiO2 phases, rutile/anatase weight ratios, and other chemical species identified by Raman spectroscopy are presented in Table 2. Amorphous TiO2, carbon (similar to carbon black), and carbonate (CO32−) are present on the as-purchased, untreated Ti foil (note the characteristic Raman bands in Fig. 2(a)). Annealing in pure oxygen at 400, 500, and 600 °C results in a gradual increase in rutile at the expense of the amorphous TiO2; the anatase phase is never observed in the untreated oxidized film. At 600 °C only well-crystallized rutile is present along with small amounts of carbon and CO32−. A steady increase in photocurrent density was observed for these films (Table 1: 20 to 277 µA cm−2) as the crystalline rutile content increased. In fact, Fig. 4 shows a nearly linear relationship between the rutile crystallinity and the photocurrent density, and between O2-annealing temperature and photocurrent density in the 400 to 600 °C temperature range. These results show that crystalline rutile exhibits a much higher photocurrent density than amorphous TiO2, and the photocurrent density increases linearly as a function of rutile crystallinity and O2-annealing temperature.

Table 2 also lists the phases identified by Raman spectroscopy for the anodized TiO2 nanotubular film. The dried film shows amorphous TiO2, carbonate (CO32−), and decomposition products of the ethylene glycol electrolyte anodization solution (ethylene glycol was not detected). The amorphous phase is converted to a mixture of about three times as much anatase as rutile at 400 °C (WR/A = 0.4), but the relative concentration of rutile increases as the O2-annealing temperature is increased to 500 °C, where about 5 times more rutile is present (WR/A = 5), and at 600 °C where about 11 times more rutile is present than anatase (WR/A = 11). Table 1 and Fig. 5 show that the photocurrent density increases from 20 µA cm−2 for the dried amorphous film to 379 µA cm−2 for the samples O2-annealed at 500 °C where highly crystalline rutile is the dominant phase. It has been suggested that upon annealing, the increased crystallinity results in enhanced charge transfer and photocatalytic activity.42 O2-annealing at 600 °C, however, results in a decreased photocurrent density of 349 µA cm−2 in spite of the increased rutile content and crystallinity in the TiO2 nanotubular film.
 Fig. 5  Plot for TiO2 nanotubular films (anodized) showing the photocurrent density (PEC) versusrutile/anatase relative concentration and O2-annealing temperature. The rutile/anatase relative concentrations are plotted using the ratio of the integrated 446 cm−1 peak area of rutile to the integrated 396 cm−1 peak area of anatase (see text). 

Fig. 5 shows a plot of the weight percent rutile (axis on the left) and weight percent anatase (axis on the right) as a function of measured photocurrent density and O2-annealing temperature for the anodized TiO2 nanotubular films. For TiO2 nanotubular films dried at room temperature, only baseline photocurrent densities of 20 µA cm−2 were observed for the amorphous TiO2 film (not shown on the graph). After O2-annealing at 400 °C, the photocurrent density increased to 58 µA cm−2 with the appearance of mostly crystalline anatase (72% anatase; WR/A = 0.4). At 500 °C, the nanotubular film is predominantly rutile (83% rutile; WR/A = 5), and the photocurrent density increases significantly to 379 µA cm−2 which represents the highest photocurrent density observed in this study. O2-annealing at 600 °C, however, was detrimental to the PEC activity as the photocurrent density decreased slightly to 349 µA cm−2 where ∼8% of the TiO2 is anatase (WR/A = 11).
A schematic diagram showing Raman-identified phases in the untreated (not anodized) and anodized TiO2 nanotubular films as a function of O2-annealing temperature and measured photocurrent density is presented in Fig. 6. Table 2 and Fig. 6 show that for TiO2 films on Ti metal foil, the anatase-to-rutile transformation occurs at much lower temperatures (∼400 °C) compared to bulk samples. Previous Raman spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction studies show that the anatase-to-rutile transformation for bulk TiO2 powders starts at 500 °C and is completed at about 700 °C;41 and for single crystal anatase this transformation does not occur until 900 °C;43 it was concluded that particle size and surface area affect the kinetics of the anatase-to-rutile transformation and that the transformation is initiated at the anatase surface and not in the bulk. “Bulk” TiO2 behavior was observed for long (50 µm) “free-standing” TiO2 nanotubes that were delaminated from the Ti metal substrate where complete transformation of the amorphous TiO2 to anatase occurred at 600 °C, and the anatase-to-rutile transformation occurred at higher than 700 °C.44 It has been suggested that the TiO2 nanotubular film must be “seeded” with catalytic rutile, as occurs in the oxide/metal interfacial region, otherwise the anatase-to-rutile transformation does not occur even at 600 °C.45
 Fig. 6  Scheme showing Raman-identified phases in the (a) untreated (not anodized) and (b) anodized TiO2 nanotubular film as a function of O2-annealing temperature and measured photocurrent density. The shaded area represents rutile. 
The kinetics of the anatase-to-rutile transformation depends on many variables including the nature and amount of Ti impurity interstitials in the TiO2 lattice as well as oxygen vacancies.26 These impurity ions, having a valence less than that of Ti4+ (which comprise the TiO2 lattice), locally increase the number of oxygen vacancies in order to maintain charge neutrality. The oxygen vacancies facilitate cleavage of the Ti–O bonds in the anatase structure which reduces the lattice volume and results in the formation of the denser rutile phase at lower annealing temperatures.25 In the present study where no impurity ions have been introduced, the reduced states of titanium (e.g., Ti+, Ti2+Ti3+) act as low-valence impurity ions and are enriched at the oxide/metal interface where rutile formation is more likely.
For the untreated samples, O2-annealing causes the formation of the rutile crystalline phase, but not anatase. Furthermore, the rutile forms at temperatures much less than that observed for bulk polycrystalline TiO2. This is consistent with the presence of oxygen vacancies created by reduced titanium (e.g., Ti+, Ti2+Ti3+) located near the oxide/metal interface. As the O2-annealing temperature is increased, the amount and crystallinity of the rutile increase and so does the photoactivity, as depicted in Fig. 6(a).
For the anodized nanotubular samples, the films are considerably thicker and consequently more “bulk-like” TiO2 behavior is expected. Similar to the untreated sample, the low-crystalline rutile phase forms at 400 °C (Fig. 3(b) and 6(b)) and is likely located near the oxide/metal interface, but the amorphous TiO2 nanotubes located outside the oxide/metal interfacial region transform to anatase. At this temperature, about three times more anatase is present than rutile in the anodized nanotubular film, Fig. 6(b). At 500 °C, there is ∼5 times more rutile than anatase because the rutile formed at the oxide/metal interface “seeded” or catalyzed the accelerated formation of rutile throughout the film. At 600 °C, the nanotubular film is mostly rutile with ∼8% anatase; the anatase is presumably located at the outer edges of the film, furthest from the Ti metal substrate. By comparison, bulk polycrystalline TiO2 that has been O2-annealed at 600 °C consists of 60% anatase.
Both the untreated and anodized films show a correlation between the amount and crystallinity of the rutile phase and the photocurrent density. For unheated films, a baseline photocurrent density of 20 µA cm−2 was measured that is characteristic of amorphous TiO2 films. It is interesting to note that at each temperature, the untreated and anodized films contain rutile with comparable degrees of crystallinity (compare the relative intensities and FWHM of the rutile peaks for the corresponding spectra in Fig. 2 and 3). Given the same number of photoactive sites for the rutile phase, it is expected that the measured photocurrent densities would be identical. At 400 °C, the photocurrent densities are comparable at 49 µA cm−2 for the untreated film and slightly higher at 58 µA cm−2 for the nanotubular film. We attribute the slightly higher photocurrent density to the greater surface area of rutile that is supported by the nanotubular film architecture; this results in a greater number of photoactive surface sites.
At 500 °C, the untreated and anodized films show significantly more crystalline rutile compared to the films O2-annealed at 400 °C. With increased rutile content, there is an increase in measured photocurrent densities of 166 µA cm−2 for the oxidized film and 379 µA cm−2 for the nanotubular film. The significant 2.3× enhancement in the photocurrent density for the nanotubular film over the oxidized film results from the increased surface area of the rutile incorporated onto the anatase nanotubes; Fig. 5 shows that the rutile content of the nanotubular film has increased from ∼28% at 400 °C to ∼82% at 500 °C. As the rutile content and surface area increase, so do the number of photoactive surface sites as long as the nanotubular structure stays intact. Prior to the collapse of the nanotubular structure (which occurs near 600 °C), the rutile that has formed on the outer surface of the nanotubes results in a much higher rutile surface area than that produced by untreated oxidized films producing more photoactive sites and a higher measured photocurrent density.
At 600 °C, the untreated and anodized films show yet another significant increase in rutile crystallinity and content compared to the films O2-annealed at 500 °C. The oxidized film shows an expected increase in photocurrent density to 277 µA cm−2, increased from 166 µA cm−2 for the film oxidized at 500 °C. The nanotubular film, however, yields a slightly decreased photocurrent density of 349 µA cm−2 compared to 379 µA cm−2 for the film O2-annealed at 500 °C. The rutile content of the nanotubular film increased from ∼82% at 500 °C to ∼92% at 600 °C, but the expected rise in photocurrent density was not observed. The unexpected decrease in the photocurrent density of the nanotubular film is attributed to the degraded morphology of the nanotubular surface (as seen from the SEM images in Fig. 1(c)). The collapse of the nanotubular structure, especially near the oxide/metal interface where rutile formation first occurs, results in a decrease in surface area of the photoactive rutile and an associated decrease in the number of photoactive surface sites. To achieve maximum photoactivity, there exists a trade-off between the advantages of anatase and rutile: maximize the amount of photoactive rutile while maintaining the high-surface area structure of the anatase nanotubes.
Another factor that may contribute to a loss of photoactivity with increasing rutile content from 500 to 600 °C for the TiO2 nanotubular film is decreased electrical conductivity resulting from lower anatase content. It has been reported46 that at annealing temperatures higher than 250 °C a significant increase in electrical conductivity occurs for TiO2 nanotubular films as anatase forms (detected by XRD); but at 450–550 °C, rutile becomes the dominant phase as the resistivity of the nanotubular film increases; similar results were found for the corresponding bulk phases.47

Fig. 7 shows a proposed scheme for the progress of the amorphous–anatase–rutile transformation within the nanotubular walls (cross-section) as a function of O2-annealing temperature. SEM images, Fig. 1, show degradation of the nanotubular morphology as the O2-annealing temperature is increased and the anatase content is decreased. For the anodized film annealed at 400 °C, the nanotubular array appears smooth and regular, with nanotubes of consistent size and shape. The film is predominantly anatase (∼28% rutile, ∼72% anatase), but there is also a significant amount of amorphous TiO2, as depicted in Fig. 7(a). Rutile is likely located beneath the amorphous/anatase nanotubular array because rutile formation initiates at the oxide/metal interfacial region where oxygen vacancies are present. At 500 °C (∼83% rutile, ∼17% anatase), the nanotubular array is cracked and uneven because the anatase near the oxide/metal interface has completely transformed to crystalline rutile resulting in some degradation of the nanotubular morphology and buckling of the film; this degradation and associated loss of surface area is depicted by dotted lines in Fig. 7. At 600 °C (∼92% rutile, ∼8% anatase), Fig. 1(c), condensation of the anatase structure to the denser rutile phase continues resulting in an irregular nanotubular morphology, increased surface cracking and buckling, and individual nanotubes appear broken and fragmented. The highest exposed rutile surface area and associated photoactive sites are observed for the nanotubular film O2-annealed at 500 °C where much of the rutile is supported on anatase nanotubes. At 600 °C, in spite of the increased percentage of rutile, there is less rutile surface area due to rutile sintering.

The observed degradation of the nanotubular morphology is expected with rutile formation because of the higher density and decreased surface area characteristic of the rutile phase of TiO2. It is known that the anatase-to-rutile phase transformation starts at the anatase surface and then continues through the bulk. For a TiO2 film on Ti metal, rutile formation initiates at the oxide/titanium interfacial region where oxygen vacancies are present. Collapse of the nanotubular film near the oxide/metal interfacial region is consistent with the morphological changes observed in the SEM images, where buckling of the film begins at 500 °C. As the annealing temperature is increased, rutile spreads out into the nanotubular layer (away from the metal surface). At 600 °C, where ∼8% anatase remains, the SEM images (Fig. 1) show that the topical region of the nanotubular array is cracked and fragmented as the remaining anatase begins to transform to the more dense rutile phase at a temperature consistent with that of polycrystalline, unsupported anatase (500–700 °C).41
In addition to oxygen vacancies created by low-valence impurity ions, the transformation to rutile has been found to depend on the composition of the annealing gas.48 A common example is the reduction of TiO2 by hydrogen which results in a color change from yellow to blue, consistent with reduction of Ti4+ to Ti3+. By comparison, annealing in vacuum was reported to retard the transformation to rutile because titanium interstitials were created rather than oxygen vacancies.25Reduction of Ti4+ to lower-valence titanium cations by reaction with reducing annealing gases introduces oxygen vacancies in order to maintain electroneutrality. These oxygen vacancies accelerate the formation of rutile at lower temperatures. It is predicted that by annealing the TiO2 nanotubes in a reducing gas such as N2 or H2 at 500 °C, the collapse of the nanotubular array that ordinarily occurs near the oxide/metal interface near 600 °C is avoided while increasing the rutile content near the outer surface of the film. The reducing gas introduces oxygen vacancies that accelerate the formation of rutile at lower temperatures at the outer edges of the array (furthest from the oxide/metal interface because this is where anatase is enriched). The increased amount of rutile distributed and supported on the high surface area of the nanotubular array is expected to result in higher photoactivity because of the increased number of photoactive surface sites. Although it was reported that TiO2 nanotubular arrays (0.4 µm in length) showed no significant increase in rutile or anatase by XRD when annealed in reducing gases (N2 or 5% H2/Ar) at 500 °C, a significant increase in photoactivity was observed for the sample annealed in H2 compared to that annealed in O2;49 it is possible that the supported rutile formed on the anatase nanotubes upon reduction was semi-crystalline and difficult to observe by grazing angle XRD.
We have shown using photocurrent density measurements and Raman spectroscopy, that photoelectrochemical activity increases linearly with increasing rutile crystallinity for oxidized TiO2 films. For anodized TiO2 nanotubular arrays, the photoactivity shows a much greater increase with rutile content, but reaches a maximum value at 500 °C, then decreases as the nanotubular morphology degrades at 600 °C. The greatest relative amount of crystalline anatase in the nanotubular film occurs for samples O2-annealed at 400 °C. At 500 °C, most of the anatase transforms to rutile and the photocurrent density increases significantly to the highest photocurrent density measured in this study. The increased photoactivity is attributed to the increased amount of rutile combined with the high surface area morphology, and possible increase in electrical conductivity, provided by the anatase nanotubular surface. The maximum photocurrent density measured for oxidized (not anodized) films is 277 µA cm−2 (O2-annealed at 600 °C) compared to 379 µA cm−2 for the nanotubular films (O2-annealed at 500 °C). This difference is attributed to the increase in rutile surface area provided by the TiO2 nanotubular array architecture resulting in increased rutile photoactive sites and increased efficiency of electron transport.
Conclusions

        TiO2 is one of the most widely studied photocatalytic materials for splitting water, but the photoelectrochemical activity strongly depends on the phase composition of the material or film. Oxidized and anodized TiO2 films may be composed of amorphous TiO2, anatase (Eg = 3.2 eV), and/or rutile (Eg = 3.0 eV). In addition, the degree of crystallinity, architecture, and surface area also affect photoactivity and electronic transport. Considering the economics of large-scale production, however, polycrystalline TiO2 films are advantageous over single-crystal films but suffer from significant grain boundaries that adversely affect photoconversion efficiency. The more ordered arrangement of the nanotubular TiO2 arrays shows promise over polycrystalline TiO2 because of observed increased efficiency of electron transport.
In this study, the photoelectrochemical (PEC) activity of nanotubular TiO2 films, synthesized by electrochemical anodization of Ti foil, was correlated with the phase composition of the film. Photocurrent densities were measured for untreated (as purchased, not anodized) and anodized (nanotubular arrays) Ti foil samples as a function of oxygen annealing temperature. Raman spectroscopy was used to identify the amorphous and crystalline TiO2 phases present in the films. Ratios of integrated Raman peaks were used as a semi-quantitative measure for the degree of crystallinity of rutile, and also as a measure of the relative concentrations of anatase and rutile within the film. These results were correlated with measured photocurrent density and O2annealing temperature.
It was found that the anatase-to-rutile transformation in TiO2 films on Ti foil initiates at much lower temperatures (∼400 °C) compared to bulk polycrystalline (∼500 °C) presumably due to oxygen vacancies located at the metal/oxide interface. For the oxidized films (untreated), the native amorphous TiO2 crystallizes directly to the rutile phase when O2-annealed at 400 °C; the crystallinity of rutile continues to increase to 600 °C as the photocurrent density increases linearly with the degree of rutile crystallinity.
For anodized nanotubular films, amorphous TiO2 is converted to predominantly anatase (∼72% anatase) at 400 °C where the photocurrent density is comparable to that of the oxidized (untreated) film. The highest photocurrent density (2.3× that of the oxidized film) is achieved for the nanotubular film at 500 °C, where ∼83% of the TiO2 is rutile. At this temperature there is enough anatase within the nanotubes to sustain its architecture and act as a support for the rutile that forms at the surface. The dramatic increase in photocurrent density is attributed to the increase in rutile surface area and corresponding photoactive sites.
At 600 °C more rutile is formed (92% rutile) in the TiO2 nanotubular film, but this is countered by the significant loss of rutile surface area due to degradation of the nanotubular array architecture. SEM images show significant degradation (from 500 to 600 °C) and cracking of the film as sintering occurs to accommodate the formation of the denser rutile structure. In spite of the increased rutile content, the photocurrent density decreases slightly from its value at 500 °C.
