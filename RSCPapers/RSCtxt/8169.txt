    , Accepted 24th July 2012First published on 3rd August 2012AbstractBio-photovoltaic cells (BPVs) are a new photo-bio-electrochemical technology for harnessing solar energy using the photosynthetic activity of autotrophic organisms. Currently power outputs from BPVs are generally low and suffer from low efficiencies. However, a better understanding of the electrochemical interactions between the microbes and conductive materials will be likely to lead to increased power yields. In the current study, the fresh-water, filamentous cyanobacterium Pseudanabaena limnetica (also known as Oscillatoria limnetica) was investigated for exoelectrogenic activity. Biofilms of P. limnetica showed a significant photo response during light–dark cycling in BPVs under mediatorless conditions. A multi-channel BPV device was developed to compare quantitatively the performance of photosynthetic biofilms of this species using a variety of different anodic conductive materials: indium tin oxide-coated polyethylene terephthalate (ITO), stainless steel (SS), glass coated with a conductive polymer (PANI), and carbon paper (CP). Although biofilm growth rates were generally comparable on all materials tested, the amplitude of the photo response and achievable maximum power outputs were significantly different. ITO and SS demonstrated the largest photo responses, whereas CP showed the lowest power outputs under both light and dark conditions. Furthermore, differences in the ratios of light:dark power outputs indicated that the electrochemical interactions between photosynthetic microbes and the anode may differ under light and dark conditions depending on the anodic material used. Comparisons between BPV performances and material characteristics revealed that surface roughness and surface energy, particularly the ratio of non-polar to polar interactions (the CQ ratio), may be more important than available surface area in determining biocompatibility and maximum power outputs in microbial electrochemical systems. Notably, CP was readily outperformed by all other conductive materials tested, indicating that carbon may not be an optimal substrate for microbial fuel cell operation.
Introduction
There is an urgent need to develop renewable energy technologies to replace depleting fossil fuel reserves. Bio-electrochemical systems, such as microbial fuel cells (MFCs), represent an emerging technology that utilises heterotrophic bacteria to convert chemical energy stored in organic matter into electricity.1 Similarly, MFCs that employ photosynthetic organisms, such as biological photovoltaic cells (BPVs), are capable of harnessing solar energy to facilitate the production of electrical power.2–7 However, power conversion efficiencies for BPV-type systems remain low (<0.1%) and much research is still required before applications can become commercially feasible.
Current MFC research is largely focused on exoelectrogenically active microbes (e.g. Shewanella oneidensis, Geobacter sulfurreducens) that can facilitate direct electron transfer to electrodes without the need for expensive catalysts or artificial redox mediators.8–10 Cultivation of microbial biofilms directly onto electrode surfaces appears critical for mediatorless MFCs.9,11–14 More recently, mixed and axenic cultures of photosynthetic microbes in mediatorless BPV systems have also been shown to form biofilms readily and possess putative exoelectrogenic activities.5,7,15 Furthermore, power outputs from those cultures responded positively to increases in both artificial and ambient light.5,7 In cyanobacterial species, present evidence suggests that light-dependent power outputs are attributable to the photosynthetic electron transfer chain.6,16 Notably, BPVs do not require an organic substrate or anoxic conditions to produce significant power outputs, and may operate in a single chamber device without the need for an ion exchange membrane.6,7 These results indicate that improving the performance of biofilms in BPVs may require a different strategy from those used for MFCs.
Although the exact mechanisms involved in microbial-mediated current generation remain unclear,17 much work has focussed on optimisation of the electrode materials used in mediatorless systems.18–22 An optimal material would be cheap and highly biocompatible, whilst also enhancing the electron transfer rate to provide favourable conversion efficiencies and power density.23 To develop electrodes that allow for increased microbial interaction, thus allowing high electrochemical reaction rates and low potential losses, researchers have focused on two main strategies. Firstly, coating the surface of the electrode material with artificial electron mediators (e.g. Mn4+, Fe3+, neutral red, anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonate) or conductive polymers (e.g. polypyrrole [PPy], polyaniline [PANI], polyethyleneimine) has been reported to enhance power outputs.22,24–27 Some conductive polymers, such as PANI and PPy, may also positively charge the surface and enhance the biofilm adhesion, in a manner similar to ammonia treatment.15,28 Secondly, changing the geometric surface area (i.e. increased porosity, holes and/or steps) can increase the space available for direct microbial attachment.29 Chaudhuri and Lovley (2003)30 reported increased power outputs with increasing surface areas of carbon graphite anodes. Much further work has been conducted to develop anodes with high surface areas, increased roughness and open porous structures.18,31 Surface area measurements need to be coupled with structural characterisation of the materials, as not all microbes can access the fine inner pores of the electrode.20
So far, few anodic materials have been investigated and even fewer have been compared quantitatively in mediatorless BPVs using similar systems and like conditions. Due to their popularity in conventional MFCs, the performance of carbon-based anodes with or without conductive polymer coatings has been examined in BPVs.15,27,32,33 In general, treating anodic materials with conductive polymers has been shown to increase power outputs. Furukawa et al. (2006)34 demonstrated that carbon cloth anodes produced more power when coated with PANI, while improved performances and light responses have been reported for biofilms growth on PPy-coated carbon fibres.33 However, Thorne et al. (2011)29 have recently shown that glass and ceramic anodes coated in fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) significantly outperformed all carbon-based anodes tested, in terms of power density. Furthermore, the microbes tested (Chlorella vulgaris) did not appear to attach readily to carbon felt fibres, whereas FTO-coated anodes produced abundant surface colonies, leading to the conclusion that increased algal loading resulted in higher power output.29 High biofilm growth rates and power outputs have also been demonstrated for a variety of different photosynthetic species using an indium tin oxide-coated (ITO) polyethylene terephthalate anode.7
One common requirement of mediatorless MFCs and BPVs is that selection of an anode material to optimise the overall performance requires an understanding of the dual functionality of the surface. Its role as an electrode requires suitable electrical properties but the nature of the surface must also favour biofilm formation and attachment. The latter is determined by the surface morphology (e.g. roughness) and those physical properties affecting surface energy, which also depend on the nature of the microbes of interest (e.g. cell size, surface charge, biofilm internal resistance). Much of the understanding of microbial attachment stems from efforts to inhibit biofilm growth, such as in combating dental plaque (e.g.ref. 35) or developing antifouling surfaces for heat exchangers.36 In the latter field, descriptions of surfaces in terms of hydrophobicity (i.e. contact angle with water) have been superseded by measurements of surface energy, as outlined by Zhao et al. (2005).36 Following Baier's early work (1980),37 many studies have demonstrated that biofilm adhesion can be reduced by using surfaces with surface energies of 20–30 mJ m−2, while biofilm growth is promoted by larger surface energies. The total surface energy, γS, however, is not a reliable indicator of micro-organism adhesion and biofilm formation. γS is the result of both polar and non-polar (dispersive) interactions, whose combination can be expressed by models such as the acid–base model proposed by van Oss (1994)38 gives: (1)Here, γLVWS is the (non-polar) Lifschitz–van der Waals interaction and γABS is the polar (acid–base) component comprising γ+S and γ−S, the electron acceptor and electron donor capacities of the surface, respectively. Other formulations such as the Owens–Wendt model exist. Recently, Liu and Zhao (2011)39 demonstrated that the adhesion propensity of several bacteria and yeasts can by related quantitatively to the CQ ratio, defined as CQ = γLVWS/γ−S. This represents the ratio of the (always attractive) non-polar interactions to the polar (and often repulsive electrostatic) interactions. For many surfaces and bacteria, γ+S is close to zero.39 This understanding, developed for inhibiting biofilm growth, offers a quantitative approach to help design or select BPV electrodes when considered alongside those material properties which determine electrode performance.
In the present study, we have developed a novel multi-channel BPV device to examine Pseudanabaena limnetica, a fresh water filamentous cyanobacterial species that readily forms biofilms and demonstrates light-dependent exoelectrogenic activity. Anodic performances of the biofilms were simultaneously characterised and quantitatively compared on a variety of different conductive materials: indium tin oxide (ITO), stainless steel (SS), conductive glass coated with polyaniline (PANI) and carbon paper (CP). Although power outputs are typically normalized to properties such as reactor volume or anode area,40 they are seldom normalized to the quantity of microbes in the biofilm. As the performance of BPV systems may be linked to substrate material biocompatibility and the density of photosystems available,6,29 in this study power outputs were normalized to the amount of chlorophyll present on the electrode material. Furthermore, to understand and interpret the exoelectrogenic interactions between microbe and anode better, surface physiology and electrochemical properties were determined and compared with BPV electrochemical characteristics.
Materials and methods
The multichannel-BPV design
The multichannel BPV consisted of five open chambers (20 ml) made from clear Perspex (120 × 160 × 10 mm3) (Fig. 1). The anodes (100 × 20 mm²) were fastened to the bottom of the chamber, and extended out of the frame of the device for connection to the external circuit. The open-air cathodes (45 × 16 mm²) were encased in Perspex and submerged beneath the surface of the medium, 5 mm above the anodes. The device was sealed together with polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) (1 mm), and connected to external wires to complete the circuit.
 Fig. 1  Design of a multi-channel biophotovoltaic (BPV) device. Following construction, the anodic chambers were inoculated with planktonic cells of P. limnetica (100 nmol Chl) that then formed a biofilm. A schematic diagram illustrates the principles of operation (a). Within the device chamber, the photosynthetic material harvests electrons from H2O in the light and releases electrons (e−) as a consequence of photosynthesis and other metabolic activities. Simultaneously, protons (H+) diffuse from the anodic chamber to the open-air cathode, where they re-combine with e− and O2 to re-form H2O. An exploded diagram of the five channel device (b) and the experimental apparatus (c) are shown. 
The anodes consisted of either indium tin oxide-coated polyethylene terephthalate (ITO) (60 Ω sq−1, Visiontek Systems Ltd.), carbon paper (CP) (200 μm thick, Johnson Matthey Fuel Cells), stainless steel (SS) (50 μm thick, grade 304, Precision Brand), or polyaniline coated onto fluorine doped tin oxide-coated glass (PANI) (3.2 mm thick, TEC 8 Pilkington). PANI was deposited on FTO glass by performing cyclic voltammetry between 0 and 1.2 V (w.r.t. Ag/AgCl) at a scan rate of 1 mV s−1 in a solution of H2SO4 (1 M) containing 0.1 M aniline using an Autolab PGSTAT 12 (Metrohm Autolab, UK). The open-air cathode consisted of carbon paper, coated with a thin layer of platinum (3 mg of Pt per m², Alfa Aesar).
Culture conditions and biofilm growth
A culture of a filamentous cyanobacterium designated as Oscillatoria limnetica was sourced from the Culture Collection of Algae and Protozoa (CCAP; Oban, Scotland) (1459/35) and initially cultivated as a suspension in BG11 medium as recommended by the CCAP (http://www.ccap.ac.uk). The culture was then streaked and grown on agar plates containing agar (0.5–1% [w/v]) and appropriate media, which were then used to inoculate fresh liquid cultures. All cultures were maintained at 22 ± 2 °C under low light (ca. 3 W m−2) in a 24 h light cycle (12 h light–dark) under sterile, aerobic conditions. Culture growth was monitored by spectrophotometric determination of chlorophyll extracted in 99.8% (v/v) methanol (Sigma-Aldrich, Gillingham, UK) as previously described by Porra et al. (1989).41
To initiate biofilm growth, planktonic cultures were concentrated by centrifugation (4000g, 10 min), resuspended in fresh medium and inoculated in the chambers of the device (100 nmol Chl per chamber). The cultures (ca. 10 ml) were allowed to settle and attach to the substrate material under static conditions for 12 h. The chambers were then carefully filled with fresh medium so as to not disturb the newly formed biofilms. The individual chambers were connected to an external load (1 MΩ) for two days to allow stabilization prior to measurement.
To normalize the performances of the devices to differences in biofilm growth rate, biofilms were grown for eight days on each of the four anode materials. Biofilms were harvested at 0, 4 and 8 days in a fixed volume of fresh medium and chlorophyll content quantified as above (Fig. S1, ESI†). Polarization curves were performed after 4 days of operation and normalized considering a linear growth rate.
DNA isolation, sequencing and imaging
DNA was extracted from 50 ml of late-exponential-phase cultures. Forward (AGATGAGCTTGCGTTCGATT) and reverse (CGATACGGCCAACACCTAGT) primers were designed to amplify ca. 600 bp of 16S rDNA. The PCR was performed using GoTaq® Green (Promega). The PCR cycling conditions were as follows: (1) 95 °C for 2 minutes; (2) 25 cycles of 95 °C for 50 s, 55 °C for 50 s and 72 °C for 1 min; (3) 72 °C for 5 minutes. The reaction contained an appropriate dilution of DNA template, each primer at 100 nM, each dNTP at 0.2 mM, 1.5 mM MgCl2 and 1.2 units of GoTaq® polymerase in the manufacturer's buffer.
Amplified fragments were visualized on agarose gels. Only a single band was observed. Gel purified products (Fermentas) were sequenced on an ABI377 (PE Biosystems) automated sequencer using Big Dye terminator sequencing kits according to the manufacturer's instructions. Phylogenetic analyses were performed by sequence alignment using BLAST on the NCBI database.
Cultures were imaged on a Leica SPS Confocal microscope (Leica Biosystems Newcastle Ltd, UK). Chlorophyll was detected with a red light (633 nm) produced by a 5 mW He–Ne laser and excitation fluorescence collected in the 650–750 nm range.
Characterisation of anodic materials
AFM images were obtained using a Nanosurf easyScan 2 FlexAFM (Nanoscience Instruments Inc.) with a 10 × 10 μm scan head in continuous mode using a Cont Al-G probe. Quantitative material surface characteristic values were obtained with the software provided (SPM software, version 2.2.3). SEM images were obtained on a JSM-6480LV scanning electron microscope (JOEL Ltd). No conductive pre-coating of samples was required.
The surface energy of the anode materials was calculated from contact angle measurements at room temperature. Surface free energies and γLVWS, γ+S and γ−S were calculated by fitting contact angle measurements for distilled water, diiodomethane, ethylene glycol and formamide obtained with a Kruss DSA100 goniometer to the appropriate form of eqn (1), as described by Zhao et al. (2004).42
BPV operation and measurements
For photo response measurements, the BPV devices were operated at 1 MΩ external load at room temperature, under a 2 h light–2 h dark cycle. Voltages were recorded using an ADC-20 High Resolution Data Logger (HRDL) and PicoLog Data logging software version R5.21.5 (Pico Technology, St Neots, UK) at 1 minute intervals. The voltages presented and discussed in this study are defined as dark voltage, total voltage and positive photo response, as shown in Fig. 2.

A confocal image of P. limnetica illustrates the filament structure, with chlorophyll fluorescence shown in green (a). Typical measurements/definitions of dark voltage, total voltage and photo response under light (white background) and dark conditions (grey background) in a BPV device are indicated (b). 
To calculate power and polarization curves, pseudo steady-state voltages were measured at variable external loads (from 10 MΩ to 5 kΩ) under constant operating conditions, as previously described by Logan et al. (2006).40 Voltages were accepted as stable at a gradient lower than 0.1 mV min−1, which took between 5 and 20 min. Current was calculated using Ohm's law.
Results
Photosynthetic culture confirmation and visualisation
Sequence analysis of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene identified the photosynthetic bacterial phylotype as phylogenetically most similar to Pseudanabaena (99% identity to strains ABRG5-3 and ACCS013), with a 97% identity to Pseudanabaena limnetica (strain no. NIVA-CYA 276/6; Genbank accession no. Z82778.1). O. limnetica is now considered a basionym for P. limnetica and is often found as a constituent part of cyanobacterial biofilms.43 Confocal microscopy images were consistent with the 16S rRNA data (Fig. 2a). The organism is therefore referred to subsequently here as Pseudanabaena limnetica. Cultures contained no contaminants, as judged by microscopic analysis and PCR.
Biofilms on all materials showed a positive photo response
Following inoculation and incubation, P. limnetica cultures spontaneously formed a uniform biofilm layer over the material surface of each of the four inoculated channels in the device (Fig. 1c). For each device (five channels), a single channel was left empty and used as an abiotic negative control. During light–dark cycles biofilms on all materials displayed a positive photo response, although voltages in the light and dark did vary significantly (Fig. 3). In BPV and MFC systems dark voltages are typically attributed to the heterotrophic metabolic activities of the biofilm (i.e. breakdown of stored carbon intermediates accrued during the light period). The photo response in BPV systems is considered to be the combined output of the latter and electron loss from the products of the photosynthetic electron transport chain (Fig. 2).6 The differences in voltages observed in the present study are attributed to the capacity of the different anodic materials to harness these two processes.
 Fig. 3  Photo responses of biofilms on different anodic materials. The devices were examined under a dark–light cycle (120 minutes; ca. 8 W m−2) using ITO (a); SS (b); PANI (c) or CP (d) as the anode substrate. An external load of 1 MΩ was applied. Inoculated anodes (red and black [replicates]) and non-inoculated controls (blue) are indicated. Histograms (e), (f) and (g) show the dark voltage, total voltage and photo response, respectively, for the four anodic materials (the mean ± standard error [SE] is shown for each data set [N = 10]). 
ITO and SS showed the largest relative increases in voltage during the light. ITO stabilised at 86.1 ± 3.6 mV in the dark and then rose to 143.3 ± 3.7 mV following illumination, representing a relative net voltage increase of 66%. SS showed a similar dark voltage of 73.7 ± 5.3 mV and increased to 170.1 ± 3.9 mV in the light (131%). In contrast, both PANI and CP demonstrated relatively lower dark voltages, with values of 45.3 ± 1.7 mV and 32.9 ± 0.9 mV, respectively. During the light PANI increased by 55% to 70.3 ± 0.2 mV, whereas CP showed a much lower photo response of 35.1 ± 1.1 mV with a net increase of only 7%. Temperatures within the chambers remained stable during the dark–light transitions (22 ± 2 °C), indicating that the photo responses observed were not due to changes in temperature. Furthermore, no significant increases in voltage were observed in the abiotic controls (Fig. 3). During light–dark transitions the kinetics of the photo response on different anodes repeated with little variation between different cycles. A sharp increase in voltages was observed for ITO, SS and PANI in response to light (Table S1, ESI†). However, the rate of the photo response was relatively slower for CP, which increased only gradually during illumination.
Performances of the BPV devices
Power curve analyses were performed to characterise further the performance of devices with different anodic materials. Similarly to the positive photo responses observed previously during light cycling, increased power outputs were observed over a range of external resistances during illumination. Small but significant differences in biofilm growth rates were observed between materials (Fig. S1, ESI†) indicating that the composition of the biofilm may have differed during operation. To account for these differences power outputs were normalized to biofilm chlorophyll content (Fig. 4). Based on these values, it is clear that ITO produced the highest specific power outputs (i.e. per unit chlorophyll).
 Fig. 4  Normalized power outputs of biofilms on different anodic materials. Polarization data were acquired at variable external loads (from 1 MΩ to 5 kΩ) under illumination (ca. 8 W m−2) or in dark. The means ± SE are representative of ITO (N = 10) (a); SS (N = 12) (b); PANI (N = 12) (c) or CP (N = 8) (d) as the anode. The ratios between light and dark power outputs are indicated. The external resistance applied at maximum power output under light conditions for each anode was 305.24 kΩ, 443.91 kΩ, 773.36 kΩ and 834.28 kΩ respectively. 
As expected, out of the four materials PANI and CP produced the lowest maximum power outputs with 31 ± 12 and 22 ± 4 pW (nmol Chl)−1 in the dark, respectively, and 54 ± 13 and 41 ± 4 pW (nmol Chl)−1 during the light. For PANI and CP the photo power outputs were 76% and 86% greater than dark power outputs, respectively. Based on the small photo response observed for CP during dark–light cycles compared to PANI (Fig. 3c and d), the similarity in power outputs observed was unexpected. However, it is likely that during dark–light cycling two hours was not long enough for CP to reach peak voltages (Fig. 3d). The protocol used for generating power curves required that a pseudo steady-state voltage was attained for each external load, an approach that more readily allowed CP to stabilise.
Higher performances were provided by SS, which generated maximum power outputs of 17 ± 3 and 101 ± 10 pW (nmol Chl)−1 during the dark and light, respectively. This resulted in the largest relative photo effect observed, where dark power was enhanced by almost 492% by illumination. However, the highest overall power outputs were generated by ITO with 134 ± 18 and 472 ± 80 pW (nmol Chl)−1 during the dark and light, respectively, resulting in a 251% increase in power in the light. During the dark ITO performed on average 6-fold better than other materials, while power outputs were even more dramatic in the light (ca. 8 fold higher).
Characterisation of anodic materials
Materials were imaged with SEM and AFM (Fig. 5; Fig. S2, ESI†). SEM analyses revealed that CP is woven from carbon fibres, resulting in a dense 3D network structure (Fig. 5d). In contrast, the other three materials were comparatively flatter with more continuous surfaces (Fig. 5a–c). Clusters (in white) were evident on the PANI, which indicated an increased surface roughness of the material compared to SS and ITO. SS also demonstrated a degree of surface irregularity due to the manufacturing process, whereas the surface of the ITO was relatively smooth and highly homogeneous. Comparative quantitative AFM measurements confirmed the SEM observations for all surface except CP, which was not possible to measure directly due to the high levels of structural heterogeneity (Table 1). Of the surfaces measured, the surface roughness average (Sa) was lowest for ITO and highest for PANI. Bliznakov et al. (2009)44 have estimated that Sa values for CP are two orders of magnitude larger than PANI. The water contact angle measurements in Table 1 show a range of hydrophobicity, decreasing from the strongly non-wetting CP to ITO, PANI and the moderately wetting SS.
 Fig. 5  Surface imaging of the anodic materials. SEM images (top) and AFM topographic scans are shown for ITO (a,e); SS (b,f); PANI (c,g) and CP (d) where possible. Mean fits of the scale for the three materials measured with AFM are 48.7 nm, 136 nm and 884 nm, respectively.

AFM surface scans of 100 μm2 (shown in Fig. 5) generated values (N = 5 for ITO; N = 4 for SS; N = 2 for PANI) for average surface roughness (Sa), mean spacing between peaks (Sm), deviation from the surface median (Sq), valley depth (Sv), peak height (Sp) and peak-valley height (Sy)

The measurements of surface energy showed a noticeable difference in total surface energy between CP and the other materials (Table 2). The CP value of ∼10 mJ m−2 is indicative of a non-adhesive surface, whereas the other three lie in the range which will favour biofilm formation: these values are consistent with the biofilm growth data in Fig. S1 (ESI†). The Lifschitz–van der Waals surface energy is the dominant component in ITO, SS and PANI but the size of the polar component varies noticeably between them, giving the different CQ ratios observed. For ITO and SS the reported dispersive and polar components of surface energy compared well with literature values (see Table 2). No data was found in the literature for PANI or CP with comparable surface roughness to the samples used in this study. Surface energy measurements for a range of PANI coatings and carbon surfaces have been presented by Shen et al. (2011)45 and Dilsiz et al. (1995),46 the latter of which also reports carbon surfaces with apolar properties.

The effect of surface properties on power output is summarised in Fig. 6. The maximum power density decreased with surface roughness (Fig. 6a) and increased with CQ ratio (Fig. 6b). The absence of a measurable acid–base component on CP prevented evaluation of the CQ ratio for this material. The measured surface energy and calculated CQ ratios did not show any consistent dependency on surface roughness. This suggests that surface roughness was not a major factor determining BPV performance.

Discussion
This is one of the first BPV-type studies to compare several different anodic materials under consistent conditions. The performances of the conductive materials used have been investigated as electrodes in previous biofilm BPV-type devices using axenic or mixed cultures (steel,47 PANI,15 ITO,7 FTO,29 carbon paper,48 carbon fiber49). Although those studies are informative, it has remained difficult to gauge which anodic material is best suited to optimise power outputs for a particular microbial population based on the variety of different device architectures used. In MFCs, the power outputs produced by axenic or mixed cultures are often supposed to be more dependent on the architecture, electrode spacing and solution conductivity of the device than the specific bacterium.10 Thus, it is not possible to compare directly power outputs produced by a specific culture between studies unless device architecture and chemical solution are the same. With MFCs there have also been few studies to date comparing performance under exactly identical conditions, even for model species such as Shewanella oneidensis.50 In the current study we have attempted to overcome this issue by using a novel screening approach on biofilms of the as yet unreportedly exoelectrogenic cyanobacterial species, P. limnetica.
All anodic materials tested produced an increase in electrical output under illumination (Fig. 3). This is in agreement with previous mediatorless BPV devices using ITO, PANI-coated or carbon-based anodes.7,15 However, this is the first time that anodes made of SS have been demonstrated to produce a positive photo response, although the maximal output was less than with ITO under the conditions used. Different anodes resulted in different maximum power outputs in the light and dark (Fig. 4). In addition, the kinetics of the photo response were significantly different (Table S1, ESI†), suggesting that electron export during the light is favoured by specific anodic materials. Similarly, Zou et al. (2009)15 showed a higher rate of voltage increase in the light for PANI-treated carbon compared to non-treated carbon anodes. In the current study, ITO produced the highest light-dependent power outputs, but SS produced the fastest photo response. Although further investigation will be required to interpret these results fully, we hypothesise that the differences are likely due to differences in cell–substrate interactions based on the physical properties of the material surfaces.
Notably, the ratio between maximum dark and light power outputs also varied between the anodes used (Fig. 4). These results were surprising, as it was expected that dark and light responses would be equally limited by the biological material, and crucially, that their ratios would not be dependent on the anode. It is unlikely that this effect is due to photosynthetic production of oxygen51 or chamber crossover of other organic products52 as (i) an open air cathode was used (i.e. the catalytic face of the cathode was not in contact with chamber solution [Fig. 1]), and (ii) previous work has indicated that light-dependent increases in power outputs are not directly linked to changes in oxygen concentration in the chamber.7 This suggests that dark and light power outputs may be a result of distinct electron export pathways that are able to interact differently with the anodic material used. In cyanobacteria, the electron export pathway(s) through the cytoplasm and across the outer membrane to the anode, either in the light or dark, are still unknown. However, it may be significant that there are differences in the distribution among the intracellular membranes of the respiratory and photosynthetic electron transport pathways.53 Reportedly, the mucilaginous sheaths seen in some filamentous cyanobacteria, such as P. limnetica, do not insulate or prevent electrogenic activity.5 Pisciotta et al. (2011)16 recently showed that two close relatives of the Pseudanabaena genus (Lyngbya and Nostoc) have similar electrogenic responses to site-specific inhibitors of the photosynthetic electron transport chain and suggested that a conserved light-dependent exoelectrogenic pathway may exist. The primary intracellular source of electrons remains controversial as separate studies have provided evidence for the plastoquinone pool or the end products of photosystem I.6,16
Biofilms of P. limnetica were able to grow on all the anodes tested, with different growth rates (Fig. S1, ESI†). Previous studies have reported that low hydrophobicity is an important property for good biomolecular adhesion (e.g. PPy- and PANI-coated surfaces)33 but the results presented here show that hydrophobicity was not directly linked to biofilm growth or BPV performance. Similarly, higher surface roughness is also reported to favour microbial adhesion, as reported in MFC systems by Logan et al. (2007)18 and Liu et al. (2010),20 particularly when Sa values are of the same order of magnitude as the bacterial cell size.54 Inspection of Table 1 indicates that only CP had surface features of the length scale of P. limnetica filaments (diameter 1.3 ± 0.3 μm, length 4.1 ± 1.0 μm for single cell and 40–50 μm for filaments). However, both the relatively low growth rate on CP (Fig. S1, ESI†) and BPV performance (Fig. 4 and 6a) show that roughness was not the determining factor. Comparison of the rate and extent of biofilm growth (Fig. S1, ESI†) and BPV performance (Fig. 6b) indicate that surface energy was a major factor. CP, which has a small γS value and negligible CQ ratio, performed worst in terms of biofilm growth (as expected) and in power outputs. The ITO and SS γS values are similar (Table 2) and lie in the range expected to promote biofilm growth. The PANI roughness was greater than SS but its CQ ratio was smaller, and its biofilm growth and power output were both consequently lower. ITO and SS have similar CQ ratios but differ in order of biofilm growth (SS greater) and power output (ITO higher). At this stage it is not possible to confirm these differences as being due to secondary roughness effects, but it is possible that the larger power output observed for ITO may be linked to an increase in direct interaction with P. limnetica filaments compared to the relatively rougher surfaces of SS and PANI (Fig. 6).
Conclusions
In the present work we have shown that anodic material can affect biofilm growth rates, maximum power output and the kinetics of bio-photovoltaic activity. Based on the system and biology used, conductive metal oxides appeared to provide better biocompatibility and power outputs than conductive polymer-coatings. Future work should address the extent to which the CQ ratio and other surface characteristics influence other biological phenomena, such as the development of an adhesive biofilm extracellular matrix. Recent evidence suggests that cyanobacterial biofilms grown on different substrates show remarkable differences in adhesion and structure.55 Extracellular pili play an important role in biofilm formation and current conduction for Geobacter species in MFCs.11 The cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 has also been shown to produce pili that are putatively conductive, which may play a similarly important role in BPV systems.56 Optimised BPV performances require that the biological substrate utilised is sufficiently exploited by the design of the reactor. This will ultimately require a more comprehensive analysis and understanding of the interactions between the biology and the components of devices than is currently typically reported. Future BPV studies should aim to characterise and compare photosynthetic cultures under as nearly identical conditions as possible. Instead of exclusively seeking higher power outputs, research should now focus on understanding the exoelectrogenic pathways involved in delivery of electrons to the anode from photosynthetic organisms.

 	Fig. 1  Design of a multi-channel biophotovoltaic (BPV) device. Following construction, the anodic chambers were inoculated with planktonic cells of P. limnetica (100 nmol Chl) that then formed a biofilm. A schematic diagram illustrates the principles of operation (a). Within the device chamber, the photosynthetic material harvests electrons from H2O in the light and releases electrons (e−) as a consequence of photosynthesis and other metabolic activities. Simultaneously, protons (H+) diffuse from the anodic chamber to the open-air cathode, where they re-combine with e− and O2 to re-form H2O. An exploded diagram of the five channel device (b) and the experimental apparatus (c) are shown.	 

 	Fig. 2  Representative photo response of the cyanobacteria P. limnetica during a light–dark cycle. A confocal image of P. limnetica illustrates the filament structure, with chlorophyll fluorescence shown in green (a). Typical measurements/definitions of dark voltage, total voltage and photo response under light (white background) and dark conditions (grey background) in a BPV device are indicated (b).	 

 	Fig. 3  Photo responses of biofilms on different anodic materials. The devices were examined under a dark–light cycle (120 minutes; ca. 8 W m−2) using ITO (a); SS (b); PANI (c) or CP (d) as the anode substrate. An external load of 1 MΩ was applied. Inoculated anodes (red and black [replicates]) and non-inoculated controls (blue) are indicated. Histograms (e), (f) and (g) show the dark voltage, total voltage and photo response, respectively, for the four anodic materials (the mean ± standard error [SE] is shown for each data set [N = 10]).	 

 	Fig. 4  Normalized power outputs of biofilms on different anodic materials. Polarization data were acquired at variable external loads (from 1 MΩ to 5 kΩ) under illumination (ca. 8 W m−2) or in dark. The means ± SE are representative of ITO (N = 10) (a); SS (N = 12) (b); PANI (N = 12) (c) or CP (N = 8) (d) as the anode. The ratios between light and dark power outputs are indicated. The external resistance applied at maximum power output under light conditions for each anode was 305.24 kΩ, 443.91 kΩ, 773.36 kΩ and 834.28 kΩ respectively.	 

 	Fig. 5  Surface imaging of the anodic materials. SEM images (top) and AFM topographic scans are shown for ITO (a,e); SS (b,f); PANI (c,g) and CP (d) where possible. Mean fits of the scale for the three materials measured with AFM are 48.7 nm, 136 nm and 884 nm, respectively.
