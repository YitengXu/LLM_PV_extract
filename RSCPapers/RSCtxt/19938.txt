    , Accepted 30th May 2015First published on 1st June 2015AbstractFour new donor–π–donor (D–π1–π2–π1–D) fused-thiophene-based chromophores, end-functionalized with electron-donating triphenylamine (TPA) groups, were developed and characterized for a two-photon absorption study. Within this series, tetrathienoacene (thieno[2′,3′:4,5]thieno[3,2-b]thieno[2,3-d]thiophene; TTA) moieties were employed as side-conjugated (π1) units, and the central conjugated core (π2) units were altered with thiophene (T), bithiophene (bT), thienothiophene (TT), and dithienothiophene (DTT) for chromophores 1–4, respectively. The structural and photophysical relationships of the four compounds were compared, and all four chromophores showed strong fluorescence with good thermal stability. The energy gap compression of these chromophores was verified by electrochemistry and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The two-photon-related properties of 1–4 were examined using femtosecond laser pulses as the probing tool. The magnitude of the two-photon absorptivity was found to be strongly dependent on the molecular conjugation length and the center fused-thiophene unit. Within the family, the most conjugated DTT-centered chromophore (4) exhibits the strongest and the most widely dispersed two-photon absorption cross-section value up to 3000 GM. To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest 2PA cross section value reported to date among the studied fused thiophene-based chromophores.
Introduction
Two-photon absorption (2PA) involves the simultaneous absorption of two photons in the same molecule, resulting in the promotion of the molecule to the excited states from the ground state.1 Owing to the wide range potential applications of 2PA materials in the emerging field of photonics and bio-photonics,2 such as optical power limiting,3 frequency up-converted lasing,4 three-dimensional data storage,5 3D micro fabrication,2h,5a,6 non-destructive bioimaging and tracking,2g,7 and two-photon assisted photodynamic therapy,8 numerous efforts have been devoted to design and engineer molecules with higher 2PA cross sections and varying molecular structures.9 It can be noted that the design of an ideal molecule for a higher 2PA cross section should include a number of key molecular features such as extended conjugation with an efficient intramolecular charge transfer and the presence of electron donor or acceptor components (or both).10 The most extensively investigated organic compounds for two-photon absorption are the donor–bridge–donor (D–π–D),10d donor–bridge–acceptor (D–π–A),11 acceptor–bridge–acceptor (A–π–A),12 donor–bridge–acceptor–bridge–acceptor–bridge–donor (D–π–A–D–A–π–D),13 and donor–bridge–acceptor–bridge–donor (D–π–A–π–D) architectures,9d with phenyl, biphenyl, fluorenyl, thiophenyl, bi-thiophenyl, anthracenyl, substituted quinoxaline and dihydrophenanthrenyl moieties as the π-electron bridges, and triphenyl amines and carbazoles as the electron donors.9a,14 Among the π-conjugated organic building blocks, fused-thiophenes are emerging as one of the most promising moieties for organic thin film transistors (OTFTs), organic photovoltaics (OPVs) and dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs).15
Due to their unique structural features, such as large energy gaps (higher ambient stability), high degrees of conjugation, and strong intermolecular S–S interactions (leading to close molecular packing), fused-thiophenes have exhibited efficient intermolecular charge transport in OTFTs.15a,b However, for 2PA, only fused-thiophenes with two and three thiophene membered rings (i.e. thienothiophene, TT, and dithienothiophene, DTT) have been explored as conjugated π-electron bridged chromophores, although these compounds have poor two-photon-absorption characteristics.16 Fused-thiophenes with more than three fused rings such as tetrathienoacene (TTA)15b have not been explored in two-photon absorption studies due to the tedious synthesis and low solubilities of such compounds. Theoretical considerations suggest that centrosymmetric systems, such as D–π–A–π–D and A–π–D–π–A, will generally exhibit stronger 2PA than their corresponding dipolar chromophores (D–π–A).2a Herein, we present the synthesis and photophysical characterization of a novel series of two-photon active D–π1–π2–π1–D architectures with symmetrical molecular structures, wherein 4,4-dimethoxytriphenylamine is the donating unit, tetrathienoacene (TTA) serves as the π1-spacer, and thiophene (T), bi-thiophene (bT), thienothiophene (TT), and dithienothiophene (DTT) units are the centered π2-bridges. Note that the solubility of these compounds has been increased by substituting β alkyl group into tetrathienoacene.17 By altering the conjugation connectivity at the center, the photophysical and electrochemical properties (including 2PA cross sections) of these synthesized molecules, 1–4 were investigated and compared. Within this family, the DTT-centered chromophore (4) exhibits the strongest and the most widely dispersed two-photon absorption cross-section value of up to 3000 GM, rendering it the highest 2PA performing chromophore reported to date among the studied fused-thiophene-based model compounds. This two-photon absorption cross-section value is about ten times higher than those of previously reported fused-thiophene DTT-based 2PA molecules.16a
Results and discussion
The chemical structures of the four studied chromophores are shown in Scheme 1, and the synthetic routes are shown in Scheme 2. Compounds 1–4 were synthesized from the coupling of monobrominated tetrathienoacene (5) with the corresponding di-stannylated derivatives of thiophene (6), bithiophene (7), thienothiophene (8), and dithienothiophene (9) via Stille coupling reactions to afford the desired products (1–4) in 75–89% yields. The key intermediate compound (5) was synthesized by the Stille coupling reaction of dibromotetrathienoacene (10) with 1 equivalent of the corresponding stannylated triphenyl amine (11). Compound 11 was prepared by the treatment of triphenyl amine bromide with n-BuLi, followed by the successive addition of tributyltin chloride.18 To maintain adequate solubility, we introduced a large alkyl (R; C9H19) substituent into both the β-positions of the tetrathienoacene core17a for all chromophores; hence, the targeted chromophores possess good solubility in common organic solvents such as THF, CH2Cl2, CHCl3 and toluene. All the newly synthesized compounds have been characterized by conventional chemical and physical methodologies.

Thermal and linear optical properties
The four new fused-thiophene based chromophores are very thermally stable. The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) plots indicate that weight loss (≈5%) only occurs on heating above 397 °C (see Table 1). The differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) scans show sharp endothermal peaks above 172 °C. TT-centered (3) and DTT-centered (4) chromophores exhibit higher melting points than those of T- and bT-cored chromophores (1 and 2). Linear absorption and fluorescence spectra of the studied chromophores 1–4 in toluene are shown in Fig. 1, and the corresponding absorption data are summarized in Table 1. All four compounds exhibit an intense linear absorption in the UV-Vis region. The absorption and molar extinction coefficients (ε) are 431 (4.4 × 104 cm−1 M−1), 443 (8.7 × 104 cm−1 M−1), 434 (3.7 × 104 cm−1 M−1), and 441 (8.1 × 104 cm−1 M−1) for compounds 1–4, respectively. Due to the more extended conjugation in the bithiophene- (bT), thienothiophene- (TT), and dithienothiophene- (DTT) centers than the thiophene- (T) core, compounds 2–4 exhibit greater red-shifted absorptions compared to compound 1. Compound 2 is further red-shifted compared to 3 and 4, most likely because the large stabilization energy of the small fused thiophenes (in 3 and 4) results in a less favorable delocalization of electrons.19 The optical energy gaps of compounds 1–4 are 2.40, 2.34, 2.39 and 2.37, respectively, calculated from the onset of the absorption. Compound 2 exhibits the smallest energy gap, which has been verified by electrochemical studies and theoretic calculations (vide infra).

Electrochemical characterization
The energy levels of the highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs) and lowest-unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMOs) are among the most important parameters to evaluate the 2PA cross sections of dye molecules.20 The electrochemical properties of the studied fused-thiophene based chromophores were examined by differential pulse voltammograms (DPVs), measured in 0.1 M Bu4NPF6 dichlorobenzene solution at 25 °C. The resulting oxidative and potential data are summarized in Table 1. The DPVs of 1–4 exhibited oxidation and reduction peaks at 0.78/−1.83, 0.77/−1.77, 0.77/−1.81, and 0.75/−1.80 (V), respectively. The derived HOMO–LUMOs of compounds 1–4 are −4.98/−2.37, −4.97/−2.43, −4.97/−2.39, and −4.95/−2.40 (eV), respectively (HOMO energies were estimated using the conventional equation, EHOMO = −(4.20 + Eox); ELUMO = −(4.20 + Ered), assuming ferrocene/ferrocenium oxidation at =−4.8 eV). Therefore, the corresponding HOMO–LUMO energy gaps of 1–4 are 2.61, 2.54, 2.58, and 2.55 eV, respectively (Table 1, Fig. 2a). Compared to thiophene-centered molecule 1, the HOMO energy levels of analogs 2–4 were up-shifted, as shown in Fig. 2a, which is consistent with the known conjugation effects. The electrochemically derived HOMO–LUMO energy gaps of the four molecules are also consistent with the values obtained from the optical spectroscopy; bT-centered 2 exhibits the smallest energy gap. It can be noted that as the conjugation length of the spacer group increases in the same series, the HOMO energy levels are up-shifted with contracted energy gaps, verifying that the DTT- (4) and TT-centered (3) molecules have more extended delocalization effects than T-centered (1).

Electronic structure analysis
Electronic structure calculations were performed at the B3LYP/6-31G* level of density functional theory (DFT; Fig. 2b). All four molecules have similar ground state geometries characterized by relatively coplanar backbones with the HOMO level electron density clearly delocalized on the end-capped triphenylamine donors, the π1-spacer fused-thiophenes, and the π2-bridge thiophene moieties, whereas the LUMO level was localized on the central moieties. The computed HOMO energies are −4.56, −4.53, −4.58, and −4.56 eV for 1–4, respectively, and the excited state (LUMO) energies are −1.79, −1.98, −1.84, and −1.93 eV for 1–4, respectively, yielding optical gaps of 2.77, 2.55, 2.74, and 2.63 eV for 1–4, respectively. With the most centralized electron density at the LUMO level, molecule 2 has the lowest computed LUMO energy and thus exhibits the most compressed HOMO–LUMO energy gap, which is in good agreement with the values obtained from the optical spectroscopy and electrochemically-derived DPV data. Time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) computations also show that the principal optical transitions of 2 and 4 exhibit similar large oscillator strengths (3.161 and 3.163, respectively), which is in good agreement with the high experimental extinction coefficients for 2 and 4 (87000 and 81000 M−1 cm−1, respectively).
Two photon absorption
The measured two photon absorption (2PA) spectra for these compounds in toluene are shown in Fig. 3, and the data is summarized in Table 2. All four compounds show strong 2PA activity, and the 2PA cross section values for compounds 1–4 are 1900, 2100, 2500 and 3000 GM, respectively. The 2PA cross section values increased from compounds 1 to 4. The chromophores with fused-thiophenes as bridging connectors (3 and 4) exhibit significantly amplified 2PA cross section values compared to 2 (bithiophene as the bridging center) with similar conjugations. This not only clearly indicates that the incorporation of fused-thiophenes as bridging and centered core units can significantly enhance the 2PA strength but also demonstrates that fused-thiophenes are suitable candidates for two-photon absorption based applications. It is noted that the peak positions of the 2PA bands of the studied chromophores in Fig. 3 are hypsochromically shifted compared to the wavelength positions of twice their linear absorption maxima (i.e. 2λ1PAmax > λ2PAmax). This implies that the most accessible two-photon state for each model dye molecule is higher in energy than that of the one-photon state of the compound. A similar trend has been observed and reported previously for other symmetrically substituted fluorophores.21 The 2PA-induced fluorescence emissions of these compounds were recorded from the surface of the sample and can be seen in Fig. 4a. The power-squared dependence of the 2PA-induced fluorescence intensity on the excitation intensity of these fluorophores was also examined. Fig. 4b–e show the logarithmic plots of the experimental data, and the results from the linear fitting (i.e. slope ∼ 2) confirm that the 2PA process is responsible for the up-converted fluorescence emissions that were observed in all cases.

Conclusion
In conclusion, a series of D–π1–π2–π1–D type conjugated model chromophores were synthesized using tetrathienoacene (TTA) as the bridging π1-unit, thiophene (T), bithiophene (bT), thienothiophene (TT), and dithienothiophene (DTT) as the central π2-units and triphenylamine moieties as the electron-donating end-groups. The related thermal, electrochemical, and optical properties of these model dye molecules were investigated through corresponding methods. The DTT-cored congener (4) exhibits the strongest 2PA of up to 3000 GM in the near-IR region, which could be attributed to the extension of the π-length of the central rigid core; thus, this compound is the highest 2PA performing chromophore reported to date among the fused-thiophene-based model compounds. This study suggests that the incorporation of oligo- to fused-thiophenes as bridging or central π-units can significantly enhance the 2PA cross section values, and β-alkyl substituted tetrathienoacenes act as highly efficient bridging units for 2PA chromophores. The experimentally derived structure–property relationships are in good agreement with the DFT electronic structure calculations. We believe that the structural motifs of our chromophores may serve as a benchmark for the future development of fused-thiophene-based chromophores for two-photon-related applications.

Solvents for the reactions (toluene and THF) were distilled under nitrogen from sodium/benzophenone ketyl, and halogenated solvents were distilled from CaH2. NMR spectra were obtained using a Bruker 300 or 500 MHz spectrometer with chloroform-d as the solvent. UV-Vis spectra were acquired using a Shimadzu UV3600 UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer. Mass spectrometric data were obtained with a JMS-700 HRMS instrument.
