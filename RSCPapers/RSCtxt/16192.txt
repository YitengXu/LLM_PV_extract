    , Accepted 12th January 2023First published on 27th January 2023AbstractDeveloping inexpensive co-catalysts for photo-thermal synergistic catalysis by artificially inducing active sites on non-noble metal compounds has drawn much attention recently. In this work, oxygen-deficient molybdenum oxide (MoO3−x) was in situ photodeposited on the surface of graphite-like carbon nitride (g-C3N4) to tremendously improve its photocatalytic activity for CO2 conversion. A series of characterization analyses divulged that the MoO3−x not only promoted the separation of photo-generated charge carriers, but also served as the active sites for the adsorption and activation of CO2 molecules. More importantly, the oxygen-vacancy defect sites of MoO3−x can trigger localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) that enables effective harnessing of near-infrared (NIR) photons, promoting photo-thermal synergistic catalytic conversion of CO2 into value-added fuels through full solar spectrum harnessing.
Introduction
Photocatalytic conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) into value-added fuels such as methane (CH4), methanol (CH3OH), formic acid (CH2O2), and carbon monoxide (CO) over semiconductors has been regarded as one of the most promising and sustainable strategies to resolve the greenhouse effect and imminent energy crisis simultaneously.1–3 Since the efficiency of photocatalysis is heavily dependent on the employed photocatalysts, the design and development of highly efficient photocatalysts are of paramount significance. In recent years, g-C3N4 has attracted enormous interest from material scientists and researchers as it is a metal-free photocatalyst with remarkable advantages of high stability, non-toxicity, inexpensiveness, facile synthesis, moderate band gap (∼2.7 eV), and opportune band positions for a myriad of photocatalytic applications.4 However, all things have two sides. The photocatalytic activity of the unmodified g-C3N4 is relatively low owing to its intrinsic limited photoresponse to visible light, fast recombination of photo-generated charge carriers, and limited active sites for the activation of reactants. With an aim at enhancing the photocatalytic performance of g-C3N4, several strategies such as nanostructures modification,5–7 foreign atoms doping,8–12 heterojunction construction,13–16 and incorporation of co-catalysts17–20 have been reported. Specifically, the co-catalyst in a photocatalytic system plays several pivotal roles, including impeding the recombination of photoinduced charge carriers, serving as the active sites to activate the reaction substrates, and extending the photoresponse of the photocatalytic system. However, many of the existing photocatalytic systems involve expensive noble metals such as Pt, Au, Ru, and Pd, which curtails the practical application of these photocatalysts. To make the photocatalytic process to be more economically viable, there is a need for the search of inexpensive, highly stable, and non-toxic dopants or co-catalysts with excellent photoactivities to boost the photocatalytic performance of base catalysts.
As known, sunlight comprises three fractions, which are ultraviolet (UV) light (λ < 400 nm), visible (vis) light (400 nm < λ < 800 nm), and near-infrared (NIR) (λ > 800 nm) light. Over the past few decades, most of the researched photocatalytic systems are only responsive to the UV and/or vis light, which account for only 4% and 46% of the solar spectrum, respectively. The largest fraction of the solar spectrum – the NIR region, which constitutes nearly 50% of sunlight – is under-exploited. The recent flourish of photo-thermal catalysis has garnered tremendous interest from researchers working on solar energy harvesting as photo-thermal catalysis allows full solar spectrum harnessing, in which the UV-vis light drives photocatalytic reactions, whereas the NIR light can induce thermocatalytic reactions.21,22 Through this, the usage of sunlight can be maximized. Although the concept of full solar spectrum harnessing through photo-thermal catalysis is fascinating, it is of great challenge to develop a catalytic system with simultaneous photo-thermal catalysis.
In this study, we demonstrate an elegant example of photo-thermal synergistic catalysis for the transformation of notorious CO2 into value-added fuels through developing molybdenum oxide with artificially induced oxygen vacancies (MoO3−x) to a compound with metal-free g-C3N4 by in situ photodeposition to achieve superior sunlight-induced photo-thermal synergistic catalysis. A series of characterization techniques revealed that the incorporation of MoO3−x allowed the effective steering of charge flow through spatial separation of photogenerated charge carriers along with the extension of the light absorption edge. More importantly, MoO3−x exhibited intriguing thermocatalytic activity, which greatly boosted the conversion of CO2 through the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) to effectively harness the low-energy NIR photons. We believe that this work will spark a new train of thought in the catalyst design to achieve efficient photo-thermal synergistic catalysis for CO2 reduction into carbon-neutral fuels.
Experimental procedures
Chemical reagents
All chemical reagents of analytical grade were purchased from Aladdin Chemical Co., Ltd., and used as received without any further purification. Deionized water with a resistivity ≥18 MΩ cm was used in the experiments where specified.
Synthesis of photocatalysts

Synthesis of g-C3N4. 
A measured amount of urea was put into a muffle furnace and calcined at 550 °C for 4 h. The obtained product was ground into powder using an agate mortar and collected for further use. The sample collected was denoted as g-C3N4.


Synthesis of MoO3−x/g-C3N4. 
Firstly, 90 mL of deionized water and 10 mL of anhydrous methanol was mixed in a beaker, and then 200 mg of g-C3N4 and a pre-calculated amount of sodium molybdate dihydrate (Na2MoO4·2H2O) were added and dispersed uniformly by sonication. The solution was transferred to a reactor for light illumination using a 300 W xenon lamp for 3 h. Subsequently, the precipitate was collected and washed repeatedly using a high-reliability vacuum pump (model: FY-1H-N, power: 150 W) and a Jinteng filtration set. Lastly, the collected sample was dried in a vacuum drying chamber at 80 °C and denoted as X-MoO3−x/g-C3N4 (X ≈ 0.5%, 1%, 1.5%). The weight percentage represents the loading of MoO3−x in the composite, which is calculated based on the addition of sodium molybdate dihydrate to g-C3N4.

Characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) for crystallographic structure analysis was conducted on a Bruker D8 Advance powder X-ray diffractometer at room temperature. A Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer (Nicolet Magna-IR 550) was used for molecular structure and functional group analyses. The specific surface area was acquired at 77 K using an automated gas absorption system. An X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS) (Thermo ESCALAB 250XI) was used for chemical composition analysis. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (JEOL JEM-2100F) was used to study the surface morphology of the samples. The UV-vis absorption spectra of the samples were acquired using a Perkin Elmer ultraviolet-visible spectrometer. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were obtained using a FLS980 fluorescence spectrometer (Edinburgh instrument) with an excitation wavelength of 310 nm at room temperature. Surface photovoltage (SPV) was tested using self-assembled surface photovoltaic testing equipment. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra were acquired using a JESFA200 spectrometer. In situ Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy analysis was performed on a Nicolet IS-50 instrument.
Photocatalytic CO2 reduction
Firstly, 50 mg of the photocatalyst was laid flat on a glass plate. The glass plate was transferred to a closed gas system with a volume of 350 mL, containing 5 mL water to provide the water vapor required for CO2 reduction. Subsequently, the reaction system was filled with Ar, and 1 mL CO2 was then injected. Finally, the reactor was illuminated with a xenon lamp (PLS-SXE300). The full solar spectrum was obtained using a UV-visible infrared full-reverse reflective sheet, the infrared range was obtained by adding a filter to attain light with λ > 800 nm, and the ultraviolet-visible region was obtained using a UV-visible full-reverse reflective sheet. During illumination, 1 mL gas was injected into the gas chromatograph (GC9790II, Zhejiang Fuli Analytical Instrument Co., Ltd China) for qualitative analysis at every 30 min.
Photoelectrochemical measurements
The electrochemical properties of the prepared catalysts were revealed using a CHI660E electrochemical workstation. For the preparation of the working electrode, a 50 mg catalyst was firstly dispersed into 10 ml ethanol with 5 mg ethyl cellulose. Then, the dispersed solution was coated uniformly onto fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) conductive glass and dried at 120 °C. The analyses were performed in a conventional three-electrode quartz cell with Pt and Ag/AgCl as the counter electrode and the reference electrode, respectively. The photocurrent response of the electrodes was measured at +0.5 V versus an Ag/AgCl electrode in 0.50 mol L−1 Na2SO4 aqueous solution, irradiated by a 300 W xenon lamp (PLS-300/300UV) with a 420 nm cut-off filter. The integrated visible-light intensity was approximately 150 mW cm−2. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were conducted at the corresponding open-circuit potentials over frequencies ranging from 100 kHz to 10 mHz in the dark using a 0.10 mol L−1 K3[Fe(CN)6]/K4[Fe(CN)6] aqueous solution as the electrolyte.
Results and discussion
In Fig. 1a, all the samples displayed two characteristic diffraction peaks at 12.8° and 27.6°, indicating the presence of g-C3N4 and its unchanged crystalline phase.23,24 Compared to pure g-C3N4, no new peaks were observed for X-MoO3−x/g-C3N4 due to the low amount of MoO3−x loaded on g-C3N4. Similarly, no obvious difference was detected in the FTIR spectra (Fig. 1b), indicating the unchanged chemical structure of g-C3N4 after compounding with MoO3−x.25–28

The microstructure and morphology of g-C3N4 and the 1%-MoO3−x/g-C3N4 composite were divulged by TEM images (Fig. 2a–c). The solitary g-C3N4 possesses corrugated, three-dimensional bubble-like unique features with translucent appearances owing to its atomically thickness to result in high optical transmittance. For the 1%-MoO3−x/g-C3N4 composite, small nanoparticles were observed on the g-C3N4 nanosheets (Fig. 2c) with intimate interaction. Owing to the poor crystallinity, no distinct lattice fringes were observed (Fig. 2d). In order to confirm what the nanoparticles are, EDX elemental mapping was conducted for the 1%-MoO3−x/g-C3N4 sample, and the images were shown in Fig. 2e. It can be clearly seen that the C, N, Mo, and O elements were evenly distributed. The well overlapping of the Mo and O elements with the C and N elements in the contact region of the nanoparticles and g-C3N4 suggested the successful deposition of molybdenum oxide, possibly accompanied by some Mo0.

The chemical structure and oxidation state of the samples were revealed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). According to Fig. 3a, g-C3N4 and 1%-MoO3−x/g-C3N4 were mainly composed of C, N and O elements. As shown in Fig. 3b and c, the C 1s and N 1s spectra of 1%-MoO3−x/g-C3N4 are almost the same with those of g-C3N4, indicating good stability of g-C3N4 during the photo-deposition process. From the high-resolution C 1s spectra in Fig. 3b, the major peak at 288.23 eV can be attributed to the N–CN bond caused by the sp2-hybridization of the C atom.29 The peaks at 284.81 and 286.13 eV are ascribable to the C–C bond caused by the adsorbed C and the C–OH bond resulting from the adsorption of water vapor on the surface, respectively. Four characteristic peaks were observed for the N 1s spectrum of g-C3N4 in Fig. 3c. The strong peak at 398.61 eV corresponds to the N-atom in the sp2 hybridization C–NC in the triazine units. Meanwhile, the peak at 399.29 eV can be attributed to the N atom in N–(C)3, and the peak at 400.91 eV revealed the existence of the amino group, whereas the peak at 404.53 eV originated from the π electron excitation in the C–N heterocycle. Compared with pure g-C3N4, the peaks of C 1s and N 1s both shift to higher binding energies by about 0.20 eV in MoO3−x/g-C3N4. These shifts may suggest the metal–support interaction between MoO3−x and g-C3N4, resulting from the polarization phenomenon of electron density from carbon nitride to Mo species. This phenomenon is quite common between g-C3N4 and metal-containing materials.30,31 The strong metal–support interaction benefits the transfer of charge carriers and facilitates the improvement of photocatalytic activity. To confirm the successful incorporation of MoO3−x with g-C3N4, the high-resolution Mo 3d XPS spectrum of 1%-MoO3−x/g-C3N4 is shown in Fig. 3d. The characteristic peak detected at 232.61 eV (Mo 3d5/2) is related to the highly oxidized Mo6+ of MoO3, while the two peaks at 230.58 and 233.85 eV are attributed to the Mo 3d5/2 and Mo 3d3/2 of Mo5+ species.32 This phenomenon is classically attributed to the existence of oxygen vacancy defects in MoO3−x in which the localized electrons are trapped at the oxygen vacant sites that caused the partial reduction of neighboring Mo atoms.33 In Fig. 3e, the two characteristic peaks of g-C3N4 at 531.82 and 532.82 eV originate from the lattice oxygen (O2−) and OH− adsorbed on the surface, respectively.34 For 1%-MoO3−x/g-C3N4, it was observed that the intensity of the O peak was enhanced and shifted from 531.89 eV to higher binding energy of 533.22 eV, indicating that a strong interaction occurs between MoO3−x and g-C3N4. The observations above provided indisputable evidence for the successful incorporation of oxygen-deficient MoO3−x nanoparticles on g-C3N4 with the presence of strong and intimate interaction.

The existence of unpaired electrons was divulged by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR). Fig. 4 shows a single Lorentzian line with a g-value of 2.001 for 1%-MoO3−x/g-C3N4, which is a typical signal originating from the oxygen vacancy defects,35 providing fingerprint evidence for the successful induction of oxygen vacancy defects in MoO3−x. In comparison, the week signal peak in solitary g-C3N4 may be attributed to its unique electronic structure which leads to electron enrichment in the internal electric field of g-C3N4.29,36

After confirming the successful incorporation of oxygen-deficient MoO3−x on g-C3N4, the performance of the as-prepared samples was evaluated via CO2 reduction. The blank experiment was firstly conducted without CO2 input. No CH4 or CO was detected, indicating that g-C3N4 did not decompose to give CH4 or CO. As shown in Fig. 5a and b, the production yields for CO and CH4 increased as the reaction proceeded. With the optimal 1 wt% loading of MoO3−x on g-C3N4, the amount of CO and CH4 generated after two hours of UV-vis-IR illumination achieved a remarkable 43.15 and 4.53 μmol g−1, which were 4.2 and 3.6 times higher than those of solitary g-C3N4 (10.29 and 1.26 μmol g−1), respectively. The comparison of the photocatalytic activities for CO2 reduction over g-C3N4-based materials is shown in Table S1.† The present MoO3−x/g-C3N4 exhibits a relatively higher photo-thermal catalytic performance for CO2 reduction. This fascinating result suggests the capability of MoO3−x to greatly boost the performance of g-C3N4, needing only a low loading of 1 wt%. Meanwhile, the reaction rates of the samples under different light illumination were compared. As shown in Fig. 5c, 1%-MoO3−x/g-C3N4 demonstrated much enhanced catalytic performance under both UV-vis-IR and UV-vis light irradiation. Significantly, the presence of infrared light greatly improved the activity of 1%-MoO3−x/g-C3N4, but no significant changes to the g-C3N4. When illuminated by UV-vis-IR light, the temperature of 1%-MoO3−x/g-C3N4 achieved 115 °C within 2 h, much higher than that of g-C3N4 (83 °C), while the temperature difference was much smaller for g-C3N4. Based on the above analysis, 1%-MoO3−x/g-C3N4 showed photo-thermal synergistic catalytic CO2 conversion, which can be attributed to the abundant oxygen vacancies in MoO3−x. In this case, the oxygen vacancies served as the defect sites to adsorb and activate the CO2 molecules. More importantly, the MoO3−x exhibited strong localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR), which greatly enhanced the absorption of IR light to promote photo-thermal CO2 reduction, as clearly demonstrated in our previous work.37 Besides, the stability of the catalyst was examined (Fig. 5d). Taking 2 h test as a cycle, no significant reduction of photocatalytic CO production after four repeated runs under identical reaction conditions was observed, indicating the good stability of the prepared 1%-MoO3−x/g-C3N4 photocatalyst.

The in situ FTIR of 1%-MoO3−x/g-C3N4 was used to divulge the photocatalytic CO2 reduction process. In Fig. 6, when CO2 reacted with water in the system without light irradiation, monodentate carbonate (m-CO32−; 1466, 1514, and 1531 cm−1), bidentate carbonate (b-CO32−; 1652 cm−1), polydentate carbonate (p-CO32−; 1407 cm−1), carboxylate (CO2−; 1681 cm−1), bicarbonate (HCO3−; 1480, 1499, and 1624 cm−1), and formate (1544, 1574, 1637, 1669, 1744, and 1781 cm−1) were found.38–40 Under light irradiation conditions, there are no changes to the positions of these peaks, while a peak at 1729 cm−1 which corresponded to the surface formic acid (HCOOH) was formed after light illumination for 1 h.41,42 This indicates that HCOOH acts as an intermediate for selective CO generation in the photo-thermal catalytic CO2 reduction. In the process of CO2 reduction to CO, CO2 molecules were initially adsorbed on the catalyst surfaces, and at the same time H2O molecules dissociated into hydroxyl and hydrogen ions on the surfaces. The adsorbed CO2 molecules could be reduced by the incoming electrons to yield the product of CO through protonation of the COOH intermediate.43

Since the efficiencies of photoinduced charge carriers generation and separation are the deciding factors for the photoactivities of CO2 reduction, transient photocurrent responses of the samples were evaluated. Generally, the photocurrent responses of the samples are attained from the on–off cycles of intermittent light illumination. Typically, the photogenerated holes are transported to the interface between the electrolyte and photocatalyst, which are subsequently consumed by the reduced species in the electrolyte. Meanwhile, the photogenerated electrons migrate to the back contact for the formation of photocurrent responses. In view of the identical preparation approach for the electrodes and electrolyte, the generation and separation efficiencies of the photoinduced charge carries are reflected by the intensities of photocurrent responses of the samples.44 As demonstrated in Fig. 7a, the photocurrent density of the 1%-MoO3−x/g-C3N4 photocatalyst was higher than that of solitary g-C3N4, indicating the much enhanced generation and separation of electron–hole pairs. Fig. 7b shows the UV-vis-NIR spectra of g-C3N4 and 1%-MoO3−x/g-C3N4. The absorption band edge of g-C3N4 is at about 460 nm, which corresponds to its wide band gap (ca. 2.70 eV), thus indicating that g-C3N4 can only be excited by UV-vis light, and it cannot display sunlight-induced photo-thermal synergistic catalytic activity for CO2 conversion. Significantly, 1%-MoO3−x/g-C3N4 exhibits extra absorption from 500 to 1000 nm. As known, MoO3 has white color and can only absorb UV light. Therefore, the extra absorption can be associated with the LSPR of MoO3−x due to the presence of oxygen defects, which is consistent with the reported works.37,45 The introduction of oxygen vacancies triggers the LSPR phenomenon of MoO3−x, which extends the light absorption range to the infrared region. Therefore, 1%-MoO3−x/g-C3N4 can display sunlight-induced photothermal synergistic catalytic activity for CO2 conversion.

Room-temperature PL spectroscopy with an excitation wavelength of 310 nm was used to study the separation efficiency of the photogenerated charge carriers (Fig. 8a). It is instantly obvious that the PL intensity of X-MoO3−x/g-C3N4 samples were much lower than that of solitary g-C3N4, manifesting that the incorporation of MoO3−x with oxygen vacancies greatly improved the separation efficiency of photoinduced charge carriers. The time-resolved fluorescence decay spectroscopy in Fig. 8b was used to further disclose the kinetics of electron–hole pair separation in the prepared photocatalysts. It can be seen that the fluorescence lifetime of 1%-MoO3−x/g-C3N4 is shorter, which indicates that the photogenerated charge carriers are captured by the reaction substrates at a faster rate for driving the redox reactions. The surface photovoltage (SPV) was employed to divulge the transmission characteristics of the photogenerated charge carriers generated by the photocatalyst under light illumination conditions. In Fig. 8c, the surface photovoltage of 1%-MoO3−x/g-C3N4 was stronger than that of pure g-C3N4, further confirming its excellent charge separation efficiency,46,47 which is consistent with our observations from transient and time-resolved PL spectra. In order to gain a deeper understanding of the conductivity of the photocatalysts, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) Nyquist plots of the samples were measured in the dark (Fig. 8d). Typically, a smaller arc radius suggests a smaller electron transfer resistance and better separation, thereby promoting a faster interfacial charge transfer process. Fig. 8d shows that the 1%-MoO3−x/g-C3N4 composite exhibited a much smaller arc radius than g-C3N4, which signifies its improved charge transfer and separation. Fig. 8e shows the N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms of g-C3N4 and 1%-MoO3−x/g-C3N4. Both samples displayed a type IV isotherm accordingly and exhibited a similar N2 adsorption capacity. In the insert pore size distribution curves, less pores were formed in 1%-MoO3−x/g-C3N4, which may be caused by the filling of the stacking pores of g-C3N4 by MoO3−x nanoparticles.

On the basis of above analyses, a plausible CO2 reduction mechanism over 1%-MoO3−x/g-C3N4 was proposed in Fig. 9. Generally, g-C3N4 is used to produce electron–hole pairs upon photoexcitation, while its catalytic activity is limited due to its intrinsic fast recombination of photoexcited charge carriers. In this case, with the deposition of MoO3−x nanoparticles on g-C3N4, the electrons (e−) on g-C3N4 preferentially transferred to the oxygen vacancies of MoO3−x to reduce the adsorbed CO2 rather than direct recombination with holes (h+). Furthermore, the LSPR effect caused by the oxygen vacancies in MoO3−x led to an effective photo-thermal CO2 conversion over 1%-MoO3−x/g-C3N4 under the UV-vis-IR broad spectrum.

Conclusion
In this work, we present a facile in situ light-assisted approach to fabricate oxygen-deficient MoO3−x modified g-C3N4. The abundant oxygen vacancies in MoO3−x effectively capture the photogenerated electrons from g-C3N4, promoting the separation of charge carriers while improving the adsorption of CO2 molecules. In addition, the LSPR effect originating from the oxygen vacancies in MoO3−x endowed an effective photo-thermal CO2 conversion efficiency over 1%-MoO3−x/g-C3N4 under UV-vis-IR light. After two hours of UV-vis-IR light illumination, the amount of CO and CH4 generated from the optimal 1%-MoO3−x/g-C3N4 achieved 43.15 and 4.53 μmol g−1, which were 4.2 and 3.6 times higher than those of bare g-C3N4 (10.29 and 1.26 μmol g−1), respectively. Considering the facile synthesis and noble-metal-free properties of our fabricated MoO3−x/g-C3N4, we believe that this photocatalytic system possesses great potentials for a myriad of photo-thermal synergistic catalytic applications.
