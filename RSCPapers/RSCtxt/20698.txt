This review addresses first the microalgae cultivation with an overview of the productivity and growth of microalgae, the recovery of lipids from the microalgae, and chemical compositions of microalgae biomass and microalgal oil. Second, three basic approaches are discussed to downstream processing for the production of green gasoline and diesel hydrocarbons from microalgae oil, including cracking with zeolite, hydrotreating with supported sulfided catalysts and hydrodeoxygenation with non-sulfide metal catalysts. For the triglyceride derived bio-fuels, only “drop-in” gasoline and diesel range components are discussed in this review.Chen ZhaoDr Chen Zhao received her doctorate (Ph.D.) in the Chemistry Department of Perking University, China, in 2009.

1. Introduction
Research on fuel production from biomass has been motivated by the desire to displace fossil fuels and to mitigate CO2 emissions and the associated global warming.1 Biofuels are more sustainable and cleaner energy carriers than fossil fuels; they reduce emissions of CO2 and of S- and N-containing pollutants.2 Microalgae are an attractive biomass feedstock to produce biofuels due to high cellular lipid contents and high photosynthetic rates. Algae biomass can capture about 3–8% of incident solar energy, whereas terrestrial plants convert only 0.5%.3–5 Some microalgae have higher than 60% oil content by weight of dry biomass, while the average oil content attains approximately 20–50 wt%. The mass of oil produced per unit volume of the microalgal broth per day is dependent on the algal growth rate and the oil content of the biomass. Microalgae grow 12 times faster and yield 30 times more triglycerides per ha compared to conventional oil producing land plants such as rape and sunflower.5 In addition, it does not require arable land where microalgae cultivation would compete with food production, and it can use waste water to provide a nitrogen source and industrial CO2 (flue gases) to boost algae biomass formation. Hence microalgae cultivation may be synergistic with biological waste water recycling and also an active CO2 sink. Together, these features make microalgae a promising green energy bio-resource.
Algae derived triglycerides can be directly used in diesel engines, but the direct combustion causes engine problems including carbon deposits, coking on the injectors and oil ring sticking due to the high viscosity and low volatility of triglycerides.6,7 These problems require triglycerides to be upgraded before use as biofuels. The commercial upgrading process involves transesterification of triglycerides with alcohols (mainly methanol from petroleum processing) into fatty acid alkyl esters (FAAEs) and glycerol which comprise the first generation biodiesel production.8–10 The production of biodiesel has been reviewed.11,12 The overall reaction is shown in Scheme 1.
 Scheme 1  Biodiesel production through the transesterification of triglycerides. 
Transesterification is catalyzed by acid or base homogeneous or heterogeneous catalysts, or by lipase (i.e. Cal B), an enzyme belonging to the hydrolase superfamily.13–15 Because alkali catalyzed transesterification is usually about 4000 times faster than the acid catalyzed reaction,15 the homogeneous alkaline catalysts such as sodium or potassium hydroxide and potassium methoxide are commonly employed in commercial biodiesel production.16 The alkali-catalyzed transesterification leads to complete conversion with 98% ester yield using a 6:1 molar ratio of methanol to triglyceride and a reaction temperature of 65 °C close to the methanol boiling point. The ester stays in the upper phase and is purified by washing with hot water to remove residual catalyst and soap. The glycerol-rich bottom phase is neutralized with acid and distilled to high purity. The main advantages of this process are mild reaction conditions, high reaction rates, and no mass transfer limitations in the homogeneous environment. However, this process suffers from the drawbacks of ester product separation from the homogeneous catalyst. The resulting slurry product needs to be neutralized and separated and a low value glycerol side stream is produced simultaneously.17
Heterogeneous catalysts, especially solid acids, can be used for transesterification of triglycerides as well,18 and bring the advantages of catalyst recycling without separation and disposal problems. Solid acids catalyse transesterification of triglycerides and esterification of FFAs simultaneously, and thus low-grade triglycerides with high content of free fatty acids (FFA) can also be converted without pre-treatment. Sulfated metal oxides (e.g., ZrO2, TiO2),19,20 mixed metal oxides (e.g., tungstated zirconia, zirconia titania),21–23 and supported heteropolyacids24,25 have been extensively studied for this purpose. Generally, high reaction temperature (120–250 °C) and high pressure as well as a longer reaction time are required over solid acid catalysts due to lower activities compared to homogeneous alkali catalysts.26
Ester biodiesel, however, has a relatively high oxygen content and poor flow quality at low temperature, limiting its direct application as a high grade fuel.27 It also has poor thermal and oxidation stability, which restricts the use of biodiesel in the modern diesel engines to below 7 vol% biodiesel–diesel mixture.27 Even the mixture requires increased injection pressure and smaller injection nozzle diameter. Also, biodiesel tends to polymerize and plug injector nozzles with coke. Therefore, it is desirable to convert triglycerides into hydrocarbons. Here these triglyceride-derived hydrocarbons are called green diesel to differentiate from biodiesel which is widely accepted as a synonym for fatty acid methyl ester.
The hydrotreating approach based on the sulfide catalysts has been applied industrially for producing hydrocarbons from triglycerides.28 Since this technique has already been established in the petroleum refineries for removal of S, N, and O, the process for hydrotreating of triglycerides can use the existing infrastructure and requires low capital investment for green diesel production. Production of hydrocarbons from triglycerides has been commercially realized in a process called NexBTL (Neste Oil, Porvoo, 340 kt a−1).29 Other companies as well (e.g. Petrobras, Eni + UOP) have patented processes for green diesel hydrocarbon production from triglycerides.30,31 However, the green diesel production capacity (0.34 Mt a−1) is significantly lower than the biodiesel production in Europe (7.7 Mt a−1 in 2008).32
Biodiesel production,11,12 hydrotreating techniques,33,34 and conversion of triglycerides to biodiesel and green diesel5,35–37 have been reviewed. In this contribution, we will focus on the catalytic process for upgrading microalgae oil to hydrocarbon fuels (e.g. green gasoline and diesel). The review will be divided into two sections based on the microalgae oil production and utilization in the up- and down-stream industry chain. The first part includes the cultivation of microalgae for algae oil in industry, the recovery of lipids from microalgae, and the composition of microalgae and algae oil. The second part addresses the triglyceride upgrading processes using the zeolite cracking catalysts, hydrotreating catalysts such as NiWo, CoMo or NiW sulfides, and non-sulfide metallic catalysts for deoxygenation. The fundamental chemistry and mechanisms involved in the catalytic routes will be discussed in detail.
2. Microalgae oil cultivation in the upstream process
2.1. Microalgae cultivation
Microalgae are microscopic, photosynthetic prokaryotic or eukaryotic organisms of various taxonomic phyla, which inhabit fresh- and saline waters (see Fig. 1).37,38 These organisms demonstrate an extraordinary adaptability to extreme habitats, growing in hyper-saline lakes, volcanic geysers, glacier fields, and even as symbionts in corals and sponges. In aqueous media, phototrophic algae biomass production only requires light, inorganic carbon (CO2, H2CO3), nitrogen sources (NaNO3) and trace elements (i.e. Mg, Mn, Zn). This simple process provides mass- and energy-efficient biomass production.

At present, the industrial application of microalgae is limited because their genomic diversity and metabolic capacities have not been systematically investigated. It is estimated that nature provides 50000 different microalgae species.37 However, only about 5000 microalgae species have been scientifically described. Of these 5000 strains, only about 10 have been subjected to more detailed investigation.38 Only the prokaryotic algae Spirulina sp., and the eukaryotes Chlorella vulgaris, Haematococcus pluvalis, Dunialenlla salina, and Phaeodactylum tricornutum (see Fig. 1) have found industrial application, mainly for the production of high-value compounds such as feed-protein, nutraceuticals (i.e. chlorophyll), carotenoid pigments and poly-unsaturated fatty acids (EPA, DHA), respectively.39
Under optimal conditions microalgae cells show accelerated growth to significant densities. Under stress conditions, when essential nutrients such as nitrogen become limiting algae accumulate storage compounds such as starch, glycogen, protein or triglycerides.40 A few eukaryotic microalgae species accumulate intracellular triglycerides in excess of 20% of dry cell weight. For example, a laboratory culture of S. obliquus resulted in a dry biomass yield of 17 g L−1 with a corresponding lipid yield of 35–70 w (d.c.w.)−1 depending on nutrient limiting conditions applied.41 In comparison, laboratory cultivation of the oleaginous yeast L. starkeyi resulted in biomass yields of 19 g L−1 with a lipid content of 53% w (d.c.w.)−1. In analogy, cultivation of the lipid producing filamentous fungus M. isabellina gave a dry biomass yield of 7.3 g L−1 and a lipid content of 67% w (d.c.w)−1.42 In contrast to oleaginous yeasts and fungi, which require a biogenic carbon source, algae culture is conducted completely under phototrophic conditions. Oleaginous algae strains harbor distinct light harvesting strategies and metabolic networks that enable efficient triglyceride biosynthesis up to 70% w (d.c.w)−1.43 The ability of these particular microalgae strains to achieve high biomass and oil yields together with cultivation on non-arable space and active CO2 and waste water utilization makes these organisms a preferred biomass feedstock for future biodiesel production.5,37
The quest for more robust algae strains that consistently provide high triglyceride yields under practical conditions continues. At present, the lack of genome information and molecular biology tools impedes targeted optimization of triglyceride producing algae.44 Therefore, process improvement is limited to the development of cultivation strategies or the characterization for new algae strains (see Fig. 2).45 Selection of technically relevant algae strains requires an integrated, interdisciplinary approach combining the development of automated, high-throughput screening protocols with systems biology methods. Cultivation of salt water algae seems to be particularly advantageous, as the high salt concentration and alkaline pH of the cultivation medium prevent contamination from terrestrial sources (bacteria, protozoan)46,47 and facilitates CO2 dissolution.48 Synergistically, these effects result in robust cultures with high biomass and oil yields. Additionally, the use of sea water in industrial algae culture systems is cheap, enhancing the economic viability of the overall process, and does not compete with fresh water supply to human or agricultural activities. However, for industrial process design, harmonization of algae selection and cultivation is essential (see Fig. 2).
 Fig. 2  The growing microalgae cultivation industry, includes (A) microalgae cell, (B) microalgae cultivation in the lab, (C) microalgae planting in the lab, and (D) microalgae planting in the tubular photo bioreactors and raceway ponds. 
Systematic studies are scarce that compare different algae strains under controlled cultivation conditions at the laboratory or technical scale.49,50 Further, technical scale production of algae biomass has mainly been conducted using expensive photo bioreactors (see Fig. 2D), which poses economic barriers to microalgae oil production. By contrast, algae cultivation with simple low-cost open pond systems suffers from process instability and low biomass yields. From the application viewpoint, both raceway51,52 and photo bioreactor53,54 production methods are technically feasible for the large-scale production of microalgae. Generally, the oil productivity per hectare of photo bioreactors is more than 13-fold higher compared with raceway ponds.
Therefore, new, technically simple and cost effective cultivation options have to be devised that provide the basis for a robust and economically sensible process.46 Independent of the cultivation system, sufficient light supply to algae cells, providing high photon flux and photosynthetic rates is a key factor for high biomass/oil yields. Nonetheless, trial processes operated at high light intensities did not yield increased algae cell growth rates or biomass formation. In fact, at the beginning of the cultivation phase, when the cell density is low, high illumination intensities are counterproductive, resulting in photo bleaching of photosynthetic elements and cell death.55 Therefore, optimal cultivation strategies will have to regulate illumination with respect to cell density in the culture medium. Sufficient illumination of high density cultures, in the final cultivation stages, remains challenging for any cultivation system. Finally, the design of a robust industrial process for microalgae biofuels will require the optimization and harmonization of all unit operations involved in biomass production, processing, and conversion.56–58 Certainly, the integration of microalgae fuel production in a consolidated bio-refinery concept will not only provide the basis for a mass and energy efficient process, but also enable economical biofuel production. In this scenario, the co-production of high-value products (i.e., pigments, protein) and bio-electricity (via biogas) from algae biomass residues is essential for an economical overall biofuel production process.58–60 Co-products derived from biofuel centered algae cultivation processes primarily constitute cellular proteins and pigments (i.e. carotenoids) for high value applications in the food and feed industry. In addition, sphingo-, phosphor-, and glycolipids, which, in contrast to the triglyceride fraction, make up the minor pool of cellular lipids, have application as platform chemicals for the production of specialty chemicals such as polymers and bio-lubricants. These high value product outlets contribute significantly to a mass and economical algae valorization process, which can be realized in a biorefinery concept.61 Early pilot scale operations under optimal climate conditions demonstrate that algae processes can deliver on the promise of a more sustainable and economic biofuels production.
The algal broth from the biomass production stage has to be further processed and recovered. The water and residual nutrients recovered can be recycled to the biomass-cultivation stage. The concentrated biomass paste can be extracted with a water-immiscible solvent to recover algal oil, and the used extraction solvent (e.g., hexane) is expected to be recovered and recycled.53 The biomass residue remaining after oil extraction could be partly used as a high protein animal feed, and possibly as a source of small amounts of other high value microalgal products.54 In both scenarios, the revenue from selling the biomass residues could lower the cost for producing liquid transportation fuels. The technology for producing biogas from algal residue through the anaerobic digestion is well developed.55 Biogas will serve as a primary energy source for the processing of the algal biomass, and the technology for converting biogas to electrical/mechanical power is also well established. The generation of surplus energy can be used to further improve the economics of the integrated process. Additionally the nutrient-rich fertilizer and irrigation water are produced during the anaerobic digestion stage and are in turn recycled. The carbon dioxide generated from combustion of biogas is recycled directly for the production of the microalgae biomass.56 The energy content of biogas (produced through the anaerobic digestion) typically ranges from 16200 kJ m−3 to 30600 kJ m−3, depending on the nature of the biomass source.48 The yield of biogas usually varies from 0.15 to 0.65 m3 kg−1 of dry biomass. Biogas production from microalgal solids (after removing 30% oil content) could provide at least 9360 MJ energy per metric ton. This is a substantial amount of energy for running the whole microalgal production process.
Under optimal climate and culture conditions the annual biomass productivity is 1.535 kg m−3 d−1.58 Assuming an average oil content of 30% of dry biomass weight, the oil yield per hectare of total land area is 123 m3 for 90% of the calendar year (about 10% of the year is unproductive, as the production facility must be routinely maintained and cleaned). 0.53 billion m3 of diesel can be produced in the U.S. per year. For this production, microalgae need to be grown over an area of 5.4 M hectares (3% of the U.S. crop areas). Algae grow very rapidly and double their biomass within 3.5–24 h,62 which is significantly quicker than other oil crops.
In a 100 tons per annum facility, the cost of producing algal dry biomass has been estimated to be about $3000 ton−1,63 but the cost declines significantly with increasing scale of the production operation. Carbon comprising approximately 50 wt% of the dry microalgal biomass is derived from carbon dioxide.64 The production of 100 tons of algal biomass fixes roughly 183 tons of carbon dioxide,65 which should be fed continuously. Microalgal biomass production can, thus, potentially make use of CO2 released by power plants,66,67 which appears to be an economical approach, but limits the use of high value side products because of contamination.
2.2. Recovery of lipids from the microalgae biomass
Nearly 80% of the carbon and up to 90% of the chemical energy originally present in the microalga can be recovered as either bio-oil or gas products. Numerous methods for recovery of lipids from microalgae have been explored, including expeller/oil press, liquid–liquid (solvent) extraction, ultrasonication techniques, and supercritical fluid extraction (SFE).60 The cost of extraction of microalgal lipids from biomass (drying, cell-disruption, recovery of lipids) is 20–30% of the total cost.61 A novel, energy-saving single-stage approach for cell rupture/lipid recovery from algae has been developed, based on the combination of micro-cavitation (using ultrasound) and selective extraction of the lipids using mesoporous solids. The method was originally introduced in the US by Catilin (“nanofarming” technology).68 The method is potentially applicable to the treatment of solutions of microalgae without elimination of the aqueous phase, but ultrasonication alone does not sufficiently disrupt algal cells. Operations in batch systems have been demonstrated, and it is necessary to develop reactors that translate those to continuous operation.
Pulsed ultrasound has also been used to break the cell walls of microalgae recently patented by Origin Oil.69 The patent indicates that the critical point of the process is a preliminary stage of low pressure absorption of CO2 by the microalgae, followed by pulse sonification that nucleates CO2 bubbles in the algae during a decompression phase. The separation of the lipid phase is subsequently accomplished by decanting.
Hydrothermal treatment can also be used to recover lipids from microalgae at 200 to 500 °C.70–72 For example, at a moderate temperature of 825 K microalgae Nannochloropsis sp. yielded 43 wt% of bio-oil after 60 min and the heating value of the bio-oil was estimated to be about 39 MJ g−1.70 Major bio-oil constituents include phenol and its alkylated derivatives, heterocyclic N-containing compounds, long-chain fatty acids, alkanes and alkenes, and derivatives of phytol and cholesterol. The gas contains CO2, CO, CH4, H2, and some C2–C3 hydrocarbons. The fatty acids which account for nearly 60% of the fatty acid content in the dry microalgae are eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) (C20:5), palmitoleic acid (C16:1), palmitic acid (C16:0), myristic acid (C14:0), and arachidonic acid (C20:4), with lesser amounts of oleic acid (C18:1) and linoleic acid (C18:2).
The rigid multi-layer cell walls of oil producing microalgae resist cell lysis and oil extraction by physical methods. However, recent data show that an enzymatic pre-treatment of algae biomass with hydrolyase enzymes significantly assists in breaking up the microalgae-cell wall, thereby releasing its contents. This biochemical pre-treatment significantly increases the oil extraction efficiencies of downstream mechanical and physico-chemical methods for oil extraction.73
2.3. Chemical compositions of microalgae and microalgal oil
Generally, algae cells comprise proteins, carbohydrates, fats, and nucleic acids (see Table 1).74 The average chemical composition of algae expressed on a dry matter basis (%) ranges from 30–50% proteins, 0–20% carbohydrates, 20–40% lipids, and 0–5% nucleic acids. The chemical composition varies with algae strain and cultivation conditions. Under stress conditions intracellular triglycerides increase,75–78 which drastically shifts the cellular lipid profile towards the formation of palmitic, palmitoleic and oleic acids containing triglycerides.78

Selected algal strains also produce long chain (C20–C22) fatty acids including arachidonic acid (AA), eicospentaenoic acid (EPA), docasa-hexaenoic acid (DHA), γ-linolenic acid (GLA), and linoleic acid (LA), which are high valued food additives.76 Some examples of fatty acid compositions in relevant microalgae are given in Table 2. For high lipid productivity, the preferable microalgae species are Amphora, E. oleoabundans, A. falcatus, C. sorokiniana and T. suecica, with average lipid productivities ranging from 97 to 160 mg L−1 day−1.76 In the ENI Gela (Sicily) pilot plant, algal biomass productivity has attained up to 110–120 t ha−1 yr−1 with lipids productivity close to 30 t ha−1 yr−1 using stable algal species capable of growing on flue gases from power plants and aqueous streams from waste water or sea water.79

3. Catalytic conversion of microalgae oil to hydrocarbon fuels in downstream processes
3.1. Cracking of triglycerides and fatty acids over zeolites
The beginning of thermo-catalytic processing of vegetable oil dates back to the 1920s. The early acidic (AlCl3, Al2O3) or basic (MgO, CaO, NaOH) cracking catalysts were operated in batch reactors80–82 at temperatures 400–500 °C. New generation catalysts based on silica–alumina and zeolites (e.g., HZSM-5, H–Y) have been developed.83 Catalytic cracking and deoxygenation with various zeolite catalysts is an alternative method for upgrading triglycerides to produce fuels.84,85 Cracking does not require H2, which is a significant advantage over deoxygenation using hydrotreating catalysts.
HZSM-5, HBEA, and USY zeolites have been investigated for the cracking of palm oils in a fix-bed reactor at 350–450 °C and atmospheric pressure.84 These three zeolites yielded 99%, 82% and 53% conversions with gasoline selectivity of 28%, 22% and 7%, respectively. In comparison to ZSM-5 favoring the formation of gasoline-range hydrocarbons and gaseous products, USY led to the formation of diesel-like product, while BEA formed fewer diesel. As a result of strong acidity and unique pore dimensions and architecture, HZSM-5 led to high yields of aromatic hydrocarbons especially benzene and toluene (80–95 wt% of organic liquid product (OLP)). The rate of coke formation increased in the order H-ZSM-5 < H-Beta < H-USY. This corresponds well with the increasing pore diameter of these zeolites and the presence of cavities in USY both favoring the formation of coke precursors inside zeolite pores. In contrast, mildly acidic amorphous silica–alumina delivered significant concentrations of aliphatic hydrocarbons (10–30 wt% of OLP) in addition to aromatics (25–50 wt% of OLP).86 SAPO-5 and SAPO-11 produced C6–C9 aromatics as the main hydrocarbons in OLP. Mg–APO-36, a non-acidic alumino-phosphate, yielded near-equal fractions of aliphatic hydrocarbons and aromatics.85
The yield of OLP for biofuel applications depended on the density and strength of Brønsted acid sites of cracking catalysts. Typically, the yield of OLP decreased with increasing concentrations and strengths of acid sites, because over-cracking yielded gaseous products.86 For example, enhanced yields of gasoline and kerosene were achieved at the expense of gases and diesel when the Si/Al ratio of HZSM-5 increased from 50 to 400. At the same time the aromatics content of OLP decreased from 52 to 35 wt%. Only small yields of coke (2 wt%) were formed.87 Amorphous silica–alumina and MCM-41 gave high yields of OLP (up to 65 wt% on feed), which was however accompanied by more pronounced coke formation (9–12 wt% of the feed).86,87 The yield of OLP was affected by other reaction conditions, e.g., a temperature increase from 450 to 500 °C decreased the yield of OLP from 54 to 40 wt% over HZSM-5.86 The importance of the density of acid sites and of their strength was also demonstrated by studies using potassium loaded ZSM-5.87 Apart from decreased conversion of triglycerides, the impregnation of HZSM-5 with potassium resulted in decreased yields of gasoline-ranged hydrocarbons, particularly aromatics.88 This change was attributed to the lower concentration of Brønsted acid sites. The differences in product distribution from HZSM-5 and KZSM-5 indicate that the catalyst acidity plays a crucial role in the aromatization and oligomerization reactions associated with deoxygenation, but hardly affects the initial deoxygenation so severely.
When mesoporous MCM-41 was employed as a catalyst, the selectivity of gasoline increased to 40% at the expense of gaseous products.89 A comparison of the catalytic cracking of a fatty acid mixture (FAM) and used palm oil (UPO) over HZSM-5 and HZSM-5/MCM-41 composite catalyst demonstrated significantly enhanced conversion of UPO at 400 °C when the HZSM-5 fraction increased from 50 to 70%. The benefit of HZSM5, attributed to reduced diffusion constraints, decreased with increasing cracking temperature. As expected, the conversion over the neat mesoporous materials was significantly lower (60–70%) as a result of their lower density and strength of acid sites.90 In fact, the yield of gasoline fraction was the highest (44 wt%) for composite catalysts having 10–30% of mesoporous phase,89 presumably because of the balance between an initial cracking in the mesoporous material and a secondary cracking in the aromatization in the micropores of HZSM-5. A similar optimum range for maximizing gasoline yield was also found for cracking of palm oil over H-ZSM-5/MCM-41 composite catalysts.87
Zeolite catalyzed cracking of triglycerides produces linear and cyclic paraffins and olefins, and oxygenated compounds including aldehydes, ketones and carboxylic acids.91 The broad molecular-weight distribution of products is a disadvantage in comparison with selective processes, because a more complex downstream treatment of the products is needed in order to use all the products efficiently. Many reactions, e.g., cracking, hydrolysis, isomerization, dehydrogenation, aromatization (Diels–Alder reaction), and coking, occur. It is proposed that these reactions proceed via a mechanism involving free radical or carbocations.92 With respect to the fractional composition, thermal catalytic cracking represents a route to gasoline rather than to diesel. Even if the catalytic cracking process is optimized, the yields of “green diesel” are relatively low. Furthermore, these products often contain carboxylic acids and other oxygenates, which could complicate their storage and distribution as well as their combustion in engines.93 In addition, zeolite-catalyzed cracking is a non-selective process that produces a wide range of compounds and serious coke formation.
The reaction pathways of triglyceride cracking over acidic zeolites have been studied by Benson et al.94,95 and another overview of reaction pathways in catalytic cracking of triglycerides was provided by Kloprogge et al.96 The reaction pathway for the conversion of oleic acid to green gasoline is presumed to start with the protonation of the unsaturated bond of the fatty acid on HZSM-5 (see Scheme 2). The proton charge may subsequently migrate along the fatty acid carbon chain. β-Scission results in cracking of the fatty acid. The narrow channels of ZSM-5 are presumed to confine protonation to the pore mouth of the catalyst. In addition, molecular modeling suggests that cracking of fatty acids begins at these acid sites at the pore mouth.96 The resulting species are sufficiently small to enter the catalyst pores, and consequent cyclization and aromatization steps form aromatic compounds (mainly propenylbenzene and phenylbutene), following the overall mechanism reported by Vedrine et al.97
 Scheme 2  Reaction pathways for cracking and aromatization of oleic acid to aromatics, adapted from ref. 95. 
Decarboxylation and decarbonylation form CO2 and CO, respectively, and the resulting reaction intermediates such as linear alkanes and alkenes are cracked into smaller hydrocarbons (see Scheme 2).98 Light olefins (C2–C4) readily oligomerize, cyclize, and aromatize inside the pores and form aromatic compounds, typical of HZSM-5.99 The aromatic molecules formed can either diffuse out or remain inside the pores forming coke in additional reactions. This is well documented by the fact that addition of single ring aromatic compounds results in the formation of naphthalene and methylnaphthalene. Both of these compounds are precursors to coke.100,101 Coke aggregates in the catalyst pores block the catalyst, preventing access to catalytic sites, and has to be removed oxidatively.102
3.2. Hydrotreating of triglycerides over supported metal sulfide catalysts
Triglycerides can be hydrotreated with conventional NiMo and CoMo sulfide catalysts that are used in petroleum refineries to produce straight-chain alkanes ranging from C12 to C18 at 350–450 °C in the presence of 40–150 bar H2.103,104 Compared with catalytic cracking, hydrotreating is more selective for diesel-range hydrocarbons. Hydroprocessing offers high conversion of triglyceride oils as well as high yields of hydrocarbon middle distillate, which can be used as an alternative diesel fuel. Due to high cetane number in the range from 55 to 90105 such fuels are sometimes called super cetane diesel.
Bezergianni et al.106–115 investigated catalytic hydrotreating of waste cooking oil (WCO) with sulfided NiMo/γ-Al2O3 to produce white diesel. Hydrotreating increases the H/C ratio, and removes heteroatoms S, N, O, and metals from the oil feedstock.109,110 A pilot plant at the Greek Center for Research and Technology in Hellas produced 2 m3 white diesel per day. After hydrotreatment, the H/C ratio was increased from 0.15 to 0.17, and the liquid density of the oil decreased from 0.858 g cm−3 to 0.757 g cm−3 with negligible concentrations of S, N, and O in the final product. Increasing the temperature from 330 to 398 °C109,110 increased the fraction of iso-paraffins from 5% to 38%, and the lighter C8–C14 alkanes increased to 22% at 398 °C. After hydrotreating the white diesel had a cetane number of 77 with a low water content of 13 wppm and a high oxidation stability of 22 h. A major disadvantage of this liquid fuel is the poor flow properties at cold temperatures. Blending with fossil diesel overcomes the shortcomings of low density and poor cold flow properties. After blending with 30% (v/v) white diesel to fossil oil, all fuel properties met the requirement of EN590.106,107,114,115
Gusmao et al.116 investigated hydrocracking of soy bean and babassu oils in a batch reactor at temperatures 350–400 °C and at H2 partial pressures 10–200 bar. They used sulfided Ni–Mo/γ-Al2O3 and reduced Ni/SiO2 catalysts, and found that only double bonds were hydrogenated in soy bean oil at low reaction temperatures (below 200 °C) and the corresponding saturated triglycerides tristearin and tripalmitin were formed. The decomposition of triglycerides accompanied by hydrogenation of the decomposition products was observed above 290 °C. Compared to reduced Ni, sulfided Ni–Mo catalysts required higher reaction temperatures (230–280 °C) to hydrogenate double bonds. On the other hand, transformation of the carboxylate groups was achieved at around 300 °C on both catalysts. For both catalysts the main reaction products were aliphatic hydrocarbons that correspond to products of either total hydrogenation or hydrodecarboxylation. Almost no cracking of the hydrocarbon chains was observed.
Da Rocha Filha et al.117 studied hydrogenation of vegetable oils on Ni–Mo/γ-Al2O3. In addition to decomposition of soy oil, the authors investigated hydrogenolysis of special vegetable oils, such as maracuja, buritimtucha, and babassu oils. The main products after 2 h at 360 °C and 140 bar in a batch reactor corresponded to n-alkanes (66–76 wt%). The yields of gaseous products and H2O were 9–13 and 5 wt%, respectively. The main product n-alkanes were accompanied by substantial concentrations of cycloalkanes (up to 13 wt%) and alkyl-aromatics (up to 4 wt%). The experimental results suggest that cycloalkanes and aromatics are formed by Diels–Alder reactions of polyunsaturated fatty acids, mainly linoleic acid, which are specific to soy and maracuja oils. The cycloalkanes had 18 carbon atoms in the structure, which further supports the hypothesis that aromatics and cycloalkanes are formed in Diels–Alder reactions. The concentration of free fatty acid in product was less than 1 wt%.
Kubička et al.118–120 explored hydroprocessing of rapeseed oil for the production of bio-components in the diesel fuel range. Rapeseed oil was hydroprocessed at 260–340 °C under a pressure of 70 bar H2 in a continuous flow reactor. Three Ni–Mo/Al2O3 sulfide hydrotreating catalysts were evaluated. Reaction products included water, H2-rich gas, and organic liquid product (OLP). The main components of OLP were C17 and C18n-alkanes and n-alkanes. At low reaction temperature, OLP contained also free fatty acids and unconverted triglycerides. At reaction temperatures higher than 310 °C, OLP contained only green hydrocarbons similar to those in diesel fuel.
Corma et al.121 investigated the hydroprocessing of pure sunflower oil with sulfided NiMo/Al2O3 at 350 °C, and it led to full conversion with 71% yield (carbon basis) of straight chain C15–C18 alkanes. The hydrotreating of triglycerides involves (i) hydrogenation of olefin double bonds, (ii) hydrogenolysis of saturated triglycerides to fatty acids, and (iii) hydrodeoxygenation, decarbonylation or decarboxylation of fatty acids to alkanes (see Scheme 3). The carbon backbone of triglycerides is hydrogenolysed to propane and fatty acids, and the oxygen removal from fatty acids is accomplished either through decarboxylation/decarbonylation to CO2/CO or via hydrodeoxygenation to H2O. However, these sulfided catalysts contaminate products via sulfur leaching, and deactivate due to S removal from the surface by a reverse Mars van Krevelen mechanism.122
 Scheme 3  Reaction pathways for the conversion of triglycerides to alkanes with sulfided catalysts. 
Ni/Mo-based catalysts were also used in hydrotreating Jatropha oil, palm oil, and canola oil in a high-pressure fixed-bed flow reaction system at 350 °C under 40 bar of H2.123 Ni–Mo/SiO2 led to n-C18H38, n-C17H36, n-C16H34, and n-C15H32 as the main products in the hydrotreatment of jatropha oil. These had high melting points and high pour points. Ni–Mo/H–Y and Ni–Mo/H-ZSM-5 formed a large amount of gasoline-range hydrocarbons due to the strong acid sites of zeolites. SiO2–Al2O3-supported Ni–Mo catalyst led to a suitable pour point (−10 °C) of the liquid hydrocarbon products, which were similar to commercial diesel.
In addition to standard hydrotreating catalysts (NiMo, CoMo sulfides), the performance of pure sulfides (Ni, Mo) has been explored to understand the roles of individual components of hydrotreating catalysts.124 The monometallic sulfide catalysts were less active than the bimetallic ones, with Ni sulfide catalyst being the least active. This is in agreement with the activity trends reported for hydrodesulfurization.124,125 Hence, Ni acts as a promoter in the NiMo sulfide catalysts during deoxygenation. While NiMo sulfide catalyst yielded both hydrodeoxygenation and hydrodecarboxylation products in the conversion of rapeseed oil, NiS yielded exclusively hydrodecarboxylation products and Mo sulfide catalyst almost exclusively hydrodeoxygenation products.118 A higher selectivity of Ni and Co sulfides for decarboxylation compared with MoS2 was reported previously also by Landa and Weisser.125 This suggests that the different electronic properties of the individual metal sulfides126,127 affect the adsorption of triglycerides and consequently the preferred deoxygenation pathway.118 Moreover, unsupported MoS2 catalysts with different degrees of stacking, i.e. with different morphology, were shown to affect the selectivity in hydrodeoxygenation of phenols. Hydrogenation was favored by a higher degree of stacking, while a lower degree of stacking favoured hydrogenolysis. An exfoliated MoS2 exhibited the highest activity per edge Mo site.128 In passing it should be noted that hydrodeoxygenation of triglycerides can also be realized with Mo2C with high activity and selectivity.129
The activity of hydrotreating catalysts is affected by the composition and properties of the support.124 Several efforts were made to understand the role of support in the activity and selectivity of metal sulfide catalysts used for deoxygenation of triglycerides.130,131 Specifically, mesoporous materials have shown great potential as catalyst supports and have been reported to provide some advantages over conventional Al2O3 support in hydrotreating applications.132,133 Mesoporous Al2O3-supported CoMo sulfided catalysts gave higher conversion of triglycerides than industrial Al2O3 supported CoMo under the same reaction conditions (250–310 °C, 70 bar H2).131 In contrast, a Si–MCM-41-supported sulfided CoMo catalyst showed significantly worse performance than any of the Al2O3-based catalysts. The yield of hydrocarbons was only 40% for CoMo/Si–MCM-41 at 290 °C, while yields over 90% were achieved when alumina supported catalysts were used. It was suggested that this is due to the differences in interactions between the active phase and support, originating from the differences in support compositions.130,131 Incorporation of Al into the MCM-41 support increased the activity of the sulfided CoMo catalyst compared with Si–MCM-41-supported CoMo; however the deoxygenation activity remained lower than that of Al2O3 supports.130
Deactivation of the metal sulfide catalysts during deoxygenation of triglycerides and related feedstock is of vast importance, particularly because these catalysts leach sulfur, which is absent from the typical triglyceride feedstock.123,124 Indeed, the conversion of rapeseed oil over a sulfided NiMo/Al2O3 catalyst decreased rapidly (from 100% to ca. 85% after 144 h on-stream) in the absence of a source of H2S.134 On the other hand, when dimethyl disulfide was added to rapeseed oil, complete conversion and original selectivity to hydrocarbons was preserved over 250 h on-stream.134 Mixing of a raw petroleum feed with the triglyceride-rich feedstock could be used to avoid the addition of dimethyl disulfide or another S source. Co-processing, i.e., upgrading of triglycerides together with petroleum fractions, was demonstrated to be feasible, but it was argued that there are drawbacks that make it inferior to stand-alone processing of triglycerides followed by their blending to petroleum-derived diesel fuels.135,136 These include reduced process flexibility as additional issues have to be dealt with, e.g., S content of the final product, the effect of water and carbon oxides on the catalyst lifetime, separation of carbon oxides from the recycle gas, etc. Consequently, most refiners seem to favor stand-alone triglyceride processing.
While H2S helps preserve the activity of hydrotreating catalysts during deoxygenation, it may also interfere with deoxygenation itself. The effects of H2S and H2O on deoxygenation of various oxygenated compounds were studied in detail.137–139 H2O inhibited the hydrodeoxygenation and hydrodecarboxylation of esters only slightly, but it enabled hydrolysis of esters to the corresponding acids. Consequently, the overall conversion of diethylsebacate was not increased due to H2O addition.137 In contrast, the addition of H2O was reported to decrease the conversion of methyl and ethyl heptanoate (ca. 5–10% decrease in conversion as a result of addition of 5000 ppm H2O).138 Interestingly, inhibition of hydrogenation reactions by H2O, as shown by the decrease of the molar ratio of saturated-to-unsaturated hydrocarbons, was observed for NiMo but not for CoMo catalyst.138 In contrast to H2O, H2S promoted deoxygenation of esters over both NiMo and CoMo catalysts.138,139 From the two principal deoxygenation pathways, primarily hydrodecarboxylation was promoted by H2S; the hydrodeoxygenation route was affected only slightly.137 These observations were explained by the increase in density of Brønsted acid sites of the sulfide phase as a consequence of H2S addition.137 Furthermore, the addition of H2S resulted in the formation of S containing thiols and sulfides, during deoxygenation of heptanonates.140 H2S affects the deoxygenation catalyst activity and selectivity, and protects the catalyst from desulfurization and deactivation. Therefore, stable and active non-sulfided catalysts are highly desired to be developed to replace conventional sulfided hydrotreating catalysts.
3.3. Catalytic deoxygenation of fatty acids and triglycerides with supported sulfur-free metal catalysts

3.3.1. Deoxygenation of fatty acids with non-sulfide catalysts. 
Catalytic deoxygenation is an alternative approach for upgrading fatty acids and triglycerides.141–144 The proposed reaction routes for the conversion of fatty acids to linear alkanes are shown below (see reactions in Table 3). Decarboxylation, decarbonylation and hydrodeoxygenation are the main condensed-phase reaction routes, while methanation and water gas shift are the main reactions in the vapor phase. Thermodynamic data for these catalytic routes at 260 °C are provided in Table 3. Hydrodeoxygenation consists of several consecutive reaction steps, in which oxygen is removed in the form of H2O and the resulting n-alkane has the same carbon number as the corresponding fatty acid. Hydrocarbonylation refers to a process where oxygen is removed as CO, and the consequent n-alkane has one carbon atom loss compared to the original fatty acid. Decarboxylation does not consume H2. Compared with hydrotreating, catalytic deoxygenation has several advantages, including the lower temperature requirement (250–300 °C), higher selectivity to the target linear hydrocarbons, and little or no H2 requirement.

Supported noble metal catalysts such as Pd/C are frequently employed for decarboxylation and decarbonylation of fatty acids.143–152 For example, 5 wt% Pd/C can yield 100% C17 hydrocarbons from C18 stearic acid at 300 °C.146 Noble metal catalysts showed high activities and selectivities for fatty acid conversion when their activity and selectivity were studied comprehensively by Murzin et al.153–161 However, they exhibited much lower activities and selectivities to the target alkanes when converting triglycerides.162,163 The high price of noble metal also limits, however, industrial application.
Peng et al.164 used base metal catalysts such as Ni supported on zeolites for hydrodeoxygenation of fatty acids (see Table 4). Ni/HZSM-5 (10 wt%, Si/Al = 45) catalyzed complete conversion of stearic acid in dodecane at 260 °C for 6 h in the presence of 40 bar H2, but severe cracking of the produced alkanes (43% selectivity) was observed (see Table 5). Ni/HZSM-5 catalysts with higher Si/Al ratios of 120 and 200 exhibited lower activities but less cracking, with the selectivity to C17 and C18 alkanes increasing to 84% and 93%, respectively. 5 wt% Ni/HBEA (Si/Al = 75) gave quantitative conversion of stearic acid with high selectivity to C18 alkane (82%) and some minor production of C17 alkane (18%), almost eliminating cracking of the hydrocarbon chain. The much higher rate of cracking over Ni/HZSM-5 was attributed to a higher effective residence time caused by the higher Brønsted acid site concentration and the narrower pores of HZSM-5 compared to HBEA. Later, Song et al.165 improved the synthesis method of Ni/HBEA to deposition precipitation and nanoparticle grafting methods from the traditional impregnation methods, and the resultant small sized Ni nanoparticles (d = 3 nm) led to five-fold higher hydrodeoxygenation activities on stearic acid and microalgae oil, and also attained much better catalyst stability in the catalyst recycling runs due to more uniform Ni particle size distribution.

After investigating individual kinetics of hydrodeoxygenation of stearic acid reactant and 1-octadecanol intermediate over Ni/HBEA under identical conditions,164 the reaction pathway for deoxygenation of stearic acid was concluded to proceed from hydrogenation of the carboxylate group to the corresponding aldehyde, e.g., octadecanal (rate-determining step), followed by either decarbonylation of octadecanal to n-heptadecane and carbon monoxide (minor route) or hydrogenation to 1-octadecanol (major route). The produced 1-octadecanol undergoes sequential acid catalyzed dehydration or metal catalyzed hydrogenation leading to the final n-octadecane. In the gas phase, CO reacts with H2 to form CH4 and H2O. On the multifunctional catalyst, Ni catalyzed the hydrogenolysis of the fatty acid ester, the decarbonylation of aldehyde intermediates, and the hydrogenation of –COOH, –CHO and CC double bonds in the oxygenated reactants and intermediates. The acid function catalyzed the dehydration of alcohol intermediates and the hydroisomerization and hydrocracking of alkane products.
Peng et al.166 tested the catalytic conversion of stearic acid on catalysts with 3 to 15 wt% Ni and various supports at 260 °C under 40 bar H2 in the batch mode (see Table 5). All Ni/ZrO2 catalysts produced almost quantitatively n-heptadecane. Pure ZrO2 support led to 13% conversion. Under identical conditions, 10% Ni/TiO2 and 10% Ni/CeO2 delivered quantitative conversions with slightly lower selectivities to C17n-heptadecane at 87% and 93%, respectively. Ni/Al2O3 and Ni/SiO2 were less active and selective; they gave 45–63% conversion with 80–90% hydrocarbon selectivity.
At a higher temperature of 300 °C, 5% Pd/C catalyzed the hydrodeoxygenation of stearic acid to n-heptadecane with 95% selectivity in a semi-batch mode at 300 °C under 17 bar of 5% H2 in Ar.153–157 Catalyst screening showed that deoxygenation activities decrease in the sequence Pd > Pt > Ni > Rh > Ir > Ru > Os.146 All carbon supported Pd Pt and Rh catalysts exceeded 90% selectivity after 6 h for deoxygenation products (n-heptadecane, 1-heptadecene, and other C17 products) at nearly full conversion. Ni/SiO2 and Ni/Cr2O3 catalysts, in contrast, had selectivities >60% for deoxygenation products such as n-heptadecane. When comparing the initial reaction rates over different catalysts, the highest rates were obtained over 5 wt% Pd/C (1.9 mmol s−1 gmet−1) and 1 wt% Pd/C (1.3 mmol s−1 gmet−1). The initial reaction rates on Pd/Al2O3 and Pt/Al2O3 were one order of magnitude lower than those from the same metals on active carbon supports. Ni/Al2O3 and NiMo/Al2O3 were substantially less active, but selectivities to ketone were high with Al2O3 supported catalysts. Thus, it was concluded that the ketonization of fatty acids is favored on the surfaces of Al2O3 supports. The higher initial rates over carbon supported catalysts are attributed to the catalyst structure, i.e., the higher specific surface areas compared to silica and alumina supports,146 thus minimizing the influence of catalyst deactivation caused by sintering and/or coking. Ru/SiO2 and RANEY® Ni led to low activities for fatty acid deoxygenation with 7.2% and 14% conversions respectively. Due to the low acidity of the supports used (C, SiO2, and Al2O3), cracking was negligible with Pt, Pd, Rh, Ir (selectivity < 5%), but it was pronounced when Ni was employed (selectivity > 15%) due to the strong C–C hydrogenolysis ability of Ni sites. Similarly, cracking was almost absent in deoxygenation of methyl stearate over Pt/Al2O3. Besides Pd/C, Pd supported on SBA-15 was active and selective for stearic acid deoxygenation, with a higher TOF on Pd/SBA-15 than on Pd/C (0.72 vs. 0.13 s−1).158 These results also demonstrate that Pd and Pt catalysts are efficient for either decarbonylation or decarboxylation of fatty acids or fatty acid esters. The influence of Pd dispersion was investigated on deoxygenation of a mixture consisting of palmitic (59 mol%) and stearic acid (40 mol%) with 1 wt% Pd/C at 300 °C in dodecane.159 The Pd dispersions were in the range of 18–72%, and the results showed that the medium dispersion exhibited significantly higher initial reaction rates (TOF = 76 and 109 s−1 for Pd dispersions of 47 and 65%) compared to the higher dispersed Pd/C (TOF = 12 s−1 at Pd dispersion of 72%). It is suggested that there is an optimum Pd crystallite size on that support. The low activity of highly dispersed Pd was attributed to the strong interaction of Pd with the supports. Moreover, the acidity/basicity of Pd/C catalysts (measured from the pH of the catalyst slurry) influenced the deoxygenation of ethyl stearate.157
Generally, these supports can be sorted into four classes (see Table 6): (i) carbon, (ii) solid Brønsted acids including HBEA and HZSM-5 zeolites, (iii) refractory oxides such as SiO2, Al2O3, and MgO, (iv) the reducible oxides such as ZrO2, TiO2, and CeO2. The neutral C support has no catalytic function and favors the direct decarbonylation/decarboxylation route of carboxylic acid functional groups on metal sites. Ni/HBEA and Ni/HZSM-5 lead to C18 octadecane as the main product, because the elementary step of alcohol dehydration is fast. When Al2O3 and SiO2 were used as supports, C17 heptadecane was the major product via the hydrogenation–decarbonylation route. Meanwhile, the side-reaction of ketonization was enhanced by these oxide supports. The bifunctional ZrO2, TiO2 and CeO2 supported Ni catalysts led to almost quantitative conversion to n-heptadecane. In the presence of H2 the deoxygenation rate of palmitic acid followed the sequence (unit: mmol g−1 h−1) of r(Ni/HBEA or Ni/HZSM-5) > r(Ni/ZrO2 or Ni/TiO2 or Ni/CeO2) > r(Ni/Al2O3 or Ni/SiO2).166 It has been also found that the turnover frequencies on Ni/ZrO2, Ni/TiO2, and Ni/CeO2 catalysts (12 h−1) were double those over Ni/Al2O3 and Ni/SiO2 catalysts (5.0 h−1).167 Such results show that Ni is the active site to hydrogenate stearic acid to octadecanal (route 1 in Fig. 3a). The higher activity with reducible supports demonstrates that the support plays a role in the reductive conversion of stearic acid to octadecanal. The mechanism for hydrogenation of carboxylic acids to aldehydes catalyzed by reducible oxides ZrO2, TiO2, and CeO2 proceeds with concerted adsorption of the acid at oxygen vacancies to form carboxylates and H2 activation via dissociative adsorption on oxygen defect sites of the ZrO2 surface168–170 (see route 2 in Fig. 3). The α-H atoms of the carboxylate can be subsequently cleaved to produce the ketene intermediate, which is hydrogenated to octadecanal on Ni nanoparticles. The two residual protons including one generated in the adsorption of the stearic acid and the other formed from the abstraction of an α-H atom of the alkyl chain, recombine with the oxygen bound at the ZrO2 defect site and desorb as H2O. The presence of the ketene intermediate has been corroborated by in situ IR spectroscopy probing with a diamond detector.167 In H2, the ketene intermediates are hydrogenated on the Ni sites to hexadecanal. Without H2 the ketene intermediate forms palmitone via interaction with the neighboring palmitate over the ZrO2 support by eliminating CO2 (Scheme 4). Therefore, the H coverage on the active sites selects either hydrogenation–decarbonylation or self-condensation (ketonization) pathways.

When using Ni/ZrO2 as a catalyst, the gas composition can also dramatically influence reaction rates and product distributions.167 The conversion decreased from 100% to 3.5% when the proportion of H2 in the carrier gas decreased from 100% to 0%. Such results indicate that the deoxygenation rate was much higher in the presence of H2, because the primary step was the hydrogenation of the acid function. As the partial pressure of H2 decreased, the selectivity for n-pentadecane decreased from 90% to 16% while the selectivity for palmitone increased from 0 to 60%. This result demonstrates that reducing the partial pressure of H2 changed the individual reaction rates and the specific pathways (see Scheme 4). Palmitone was the dominant product with 97% selectivity at 320 °C. Even though high conversion of stearic acid and its esters was observed in an inert atmosphere, the presence of H2 was found to be beneficial for catalyst stability.171,172 The fast deactivation in an inert atmosphere was ascribed to the formation of heavy products and unsaturated hydrocarbons which participated in oligomerization reactions leading to coke formation. Owing to the fast saturation of unsaturated intermediates in a H2 atmosphere, the catalyst deactivation was greatly diminished.171 Similar results were reported also for fixed bed deoxygenation of stearic acid over Pd/C (360 °C, 10 bar Ar or 5% H2 in Ar) where stable conversion was achieved only in the presence of H2.160 The effect of H2 concentration in the reaction atmosphere was studied in ethyl stearate deoxygenation.152 The decreasing H2 concentrations (different H2–He mixtures) decreased the initial reaction rate and the selectivity to n-heptadecane. Since ethylstearate decomposes into ethene and stearic acid in the absence of a catalyst at temperatures around 300 °C,173 the positive effect of H2 has been attributed to preservation of the catalyst activity due to hydrogenation of alkene intermediates as observed in methyloctanoate deoxygenation.171
The importance of H2 for deoxygenation of carboxylic acids was further confirmed by investigating the solvent effect.154,172 It was proposed that some solvents may act as hydrogen donors via a hydrogenation–dehydrogenation equilibrium and consequently affect deoxygenation. Dodecane was found to undergo dehydrogenation (conversion ca. 2%) over Pd/C under typical deoxygenation conditions (300 °C, 15 bar H2) and H2 was formed.172 Analogously, the initial rate of formation of stearic acid from ethyl stearate in an inert atmosphere was higher in dodecane than in mesitylene.154 While dodecane can act as an H-donor solvent, mesitylene cannot. The initial rate of n-heptadecane formation remained, however, unaltered by the solvent, suggesting that the initial deoxygenation was not affected by hydrogen availability.154
Deoxygenation of different fatty acids (C17–C22) in dodecane under Ar (300 °C, 17 bar, Pd/C) was shown to be independent of chain lengths; the initial deoxygenation rates of C17, C18 and C20 fatty acids were almost identical.174 The same conclusion was reached also for deoxygenation of palmitic and stearic acid under 5% H2 in Ar.159 The different rates of deoxygenation observed in the case of the C19 or C22 fatty acids was attributed to their impurities, i.e., unsaturated fatty acids and phosphorus, respectively. The final conversion dropped from about 90% to approximately 20% when such impurities were present.
Gaseous products formed and detected during the deoxygenation of fatty acids provide necessary information about the reaction mechanism over the metal catalysts. The ratio of product CO2 to CO was compared from RANEY® Ni, Pt black or Pd black to discriminate the decarbonylation (–CO) and decarboxylation (–CO2) routes.167 The products from palmitic acid over the three metals at 300 °C in 12 bar N2 are displayed in Fig. 4. RANEY® Ni was pre-dried to eliminate potential methanation and water gas shift reactions. In N2, the deoxygenation activity (mmol molmetal−1 h−1) of palmitic acid conversion followed the sequence r(Pt black) ≈ r(Pd black) > r(RANEY® nickel) (see Fig. 4). Decarboxylation (–CO2) of palmitic acid was the dominant pathway for Pd black. However, decarbonylation (–CO) was more prevalent on Pt and Ni.166 The difference is attributed to the different adsorbed species derived from the fatty acid reactant. CH3COO* has been reported to be the main species after adsorption of acetic acid on the Pd (111) surface, whereas both CH3COO* and CH3CO* species have been observed on Pt (111).175,176 The distinctively different adsorption structures are likely to determine the pathway leading to CO or CO2 elimination. It is also observed that CO2 was detected as the major gaseous product in deoxygenation of several carboxylic acids on Pd/SiO2.144 CO2 formation was explained by α–β adsorption of primary and secondary acids followed by the adsorbed C–C bond hydrogenolysis and H-assisted desorption of the hydrocarbons and CO2. Parallel formation of CO2 and CO was observed in deoxygenation of oleic and stearic acids with CO2 being the predominant gaseous product under a H2 or 10% H2–He atmosphere (CO2/CO = 8–9 mol mol−1).172 These results show that the complex catalytic sequences for deoxygenation of fatty acids can be adjusted by subtly tuning individual reaction steps via the nature of the catalyst components, the gas atmosphere as well as the temperature. Multiple pathways can be generated in this way that enhances not only the reaction rates, but also the stability of the catalysts by providing multifunctional catalytic sites.

3.3.2. Deoxygenation of triglycerides with non-sulfur metal catalysts. 
There have been extensive efforts to upgrade triglycerides to hydrocarbon fuels with non-sulfide metal catalysts. Peng et al.164 hydrotreated the crude microalgae oil (without purification) in a batch mode over 10 wt% Ni/HBEA (Si/Al = 180) at 260 °C in the presence of 40 bar H2. A 78 wt% yield of liquid alkanes (including 60 wt% yield of C18 octadecane) was obtained after 8 h (Table 6), which was very close to the theoretical maximum liquid hydrocarbon yield (84 wt%). Propane (3.6 wt%) and methane (0.6 wt%) were the main products in the vapor phase.164 At 270 °C, Ni/ZrO2 converted microalgae oil quantitatively to C17 alkanes under 40 bar H2.166

Scheme 5 shows the detailed reaction pathway for conversion of triglycerides with Ni/HBEA.164,165 It proceeds via an initial metal catalyzed hydrogenation of the double bonds in the alkyl chain, followed by hydrogenolysis of the saturated triglyceride leading to fatty acid and propane. The subsequent hydrogenation of the carboxylate group of the fatty acids leads to the corresponding aldehyde (rate determining step), followed by either decarbonylation of octadecanal to n-heptadecane and carbon monoxide (minor route) or hydrogenation of octadecanal to 1-octadecanol (major route). Subsequently, the produced 1-octadecanol undergoes sequential acid catalyzed dehydration and metal catalyzed hydrogenation leading to the final n-octadecane. Acidic sites in the zeolite catalyze hydroisomerization and hydrocracking of the alkanes. CO may react with H2 to produce CH4 and H2O. The chemistry with Ni/ZrO2 is very similar to Ni/HBEA, but the formed C18 alcohol favors the decarbonylation route rather than the dehydration route. Thus, C17 alkanes were the major products with Ni/ZrO2, while C18 alkanes were dominant over Ni/HBEA.
 Scheme 5  Proposed reaction pathway for the transformation of microalgae oil to alkanes over bifunctional Ni/HBEA catalysts, adapted from ref. 164. 
Apart from the supported Ni catalysts, a non-pyrophoric RANEY® nickel type catalyst was investigated in the hydro-conversion of sunflower oil.177 The catalyst was also tested in the transformation of octanoic acid as a model compound at 21 bar H2 at 340 °C. It leads to 85% conversion with 58% hydrocarbon selectivity with RANEY® Ni catalysts (Table 6) via the hydrodecarbonylation and decarboxylation routes. Besides the main hydrodecarbonylation reaction, Ni-based catalysts are active in CO methanation and C–C bond cleavage of paraffins producing methane by-product in high concentration with high H2 consumption. Non-pyrophoric RANEY® nickel catalyst is more active than Ni/Al2O3 samples, especially in the C–C hydrogenolysis reaction. To eliminate the active sites responsible for the side reactions the catalyst was modified with the metal cations. Addition of In2O3, but not Sn or Pb, was effective by directing the transformation to a different deoxygenating reaction pathway resulting in high alcohol yields.
The carbon supported metals including 20 wt% Ni/C, 5 wt% Pd/C, and 1 wt% Pt/C catalysts were used to deoxygenate triglycerides (tristearin, triolein, and soybean oil) under N2.178 The use of the Ni catalyst resulted in near quantitative conversions of the triglyceride in each raw feedstock (Table 6) and high yields of linear C5 to C17 alkanes and alkenes were obtained. Oxygen was rejected as CO and CO2, while small amounts of light alkanes (C1–C4) and H2 were also formed. The 13C NMR spectroscopic analysis of the liquid product from soybean oil deoxygenation during reaction suggested that the pathway for triglyceride deoxygenation involves the conversion of fatty acids via C–O bond scission and concomitant H transfer, followed by elimination of CO2 from the acids in a later step. Compared to Ni, Pd/C and Pt/C showed lower activity for both triglyceride deoxygenation and for C–C bond cleavage of the fatty acid chains.
A supported 5 wt% Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalyst was employed to deoxygenate a model feed consisting of oleic acid and tripalmitin in the molar ratio 1:3 at 325 °C with 20 bars H2 in a stirred batch autoclave (Table 6).179 Under those conditions, hydrogenation of both reactants was limited even with high H2 pressure. Decarboxylation or decarbonylation of the ester and carboxylic acid functionalities were favoured, yielding odd carbon number chain lengths. Pd/γ-Al2O3 was slightly more active than Pt/γ-Al2O3, and Pd/γ-Al2O3 gave a higher ratio of decarboxylation and decarbonylation to hydrogenation. Ni/γ-Al2O3 was substantially less active than Pt and also showed a markedly lower ratio of decarboxylation and decarbonylation to hydrogenation. Increase of the temperature from 250 °C to 325 °C led to the conversion of oleic acid that increased from 6% to 100%. Tripalmitin was converted by forming a palmitic acid intermediate, suggesting that the primary main reaction is the metal catalyzed hydrogenolysis of the ester C–O bond.
An HZSM-5 supported Pt catalyst for deoxygenating jatropha oil and vegetable oils to green diesel-type alkanes was explored at 543–573 K180 with the weight ratio of jatropha or vegetable oil/catalyst of 1. The carbon molar yield of straight chain C15–C18 alkanes was ∼80% for hydrodeoxygenation of pure jatropha oil (Table 6). With a high jatropha oil/catalyst ratio of 10, re-modified Pt/H-ZSM-5 catalyst was more effective in producing the C15–C18 alkane yield. The yield of C15–C18 alkanes was 67% at an optimum Re/Al molar ratio of 0.8. Catalyst characterization indicates that metallic Pt and Re are segregated on the surface, but synergism of these two metals may play an important role in the deoxygenation reaction, even at a high ratio of jatropha oil/catalyst of 10. The reaction pathway for removing O atoms from the triglycerides involves hydrogenation of the CC bonds of the jatropha oils, followed by hydrodeoxygenation as well as decarbonylation and decarboxylation to form C15–C18 straight chain alkane mixtures.
In summary, the current triglyceride deoxygenation approaches are focused on supported metal catalysts. The metals range from noble metals of Pt, Pd, to base metal of Ni, and the supports are chosen from activated carbon to oxides such as Al2O3, SiO2, SiO2–Al2O3, H-Zeolite (HZSM-5, HBEA, HY, H-MOR, FER, and USY). It has been noted that vegetable oils rather than microalgae oil are more frequently used as feedstock for hydrodeoxygenation to green hydrocarbon fuels in the past. The techniques of hydrodeoxygenation of microalgae oil are evolving, but currently the upgrading level is far away from the requirements of high efficiency and atomic economy, especially using inexpensive base metal catalysts under mild conditions.

4. Concluding remark and outlook
High triglyceride productivity, non-competition for arable land and fresh water together with net uptake of CO2 make the microalgae bio-resource a promising raw material. Selective and non-selective hydrodeoxygenation of microalgae derived triglycerides and related feedstocks should be a key process for the production of high-quality hydrocarbon-based fuels. Selective deoxygenation delivers green diesel as the main product using supported metal and sulfided metal catalysts, and consuming little H2. Non-selective deoxygenation over zeolite-based catalysts is less useful, producing a wide variety of products including fuel gases, gasoline- and diesel-like products.
Microporous and mesoporous molecular sieves can crack triglycerides and related feedstocks into smaller hydrocarbons in the absence of H2. Consequently, gaseous olefins and abundant aromatic liquid products are formed, which can be used for gasoline additives. The main drawbacks of this approach are the need for upgrading the primary cracking products such as aldehydes and alcohols as well as the fast deactivation of the catalysts.
The traditional hydrotreating catalysts such as supported NiMoS take advantage of valuable application experience from the petroleum industry. But these catalysts rapidly deactivate without sulphur resupply due to the Mars van Krevelen mechanism. The trace amount of produced water would accelerate the leaching process and severely shorten the lifetime of sulfided catalysts. Furthermore, the formed carbon oxides cause issues with the separation from the recycle gas. Therefore, it would be more attractive and useful to develop stable and active non-sulfided catalysts to replace conventional hydrotreating catalysts.
Supported metal and particularly base metal catalysts are promising candidates owing to their high selectivity and moderate H2 consumption. The oxygen atoms in the bio-resource are removed by the dehydration reaction or the decarboxylation/decarbonylation routes. Ni nanoparticles supported on ZrO2 or Brønsted acidic zeolites are very active for the hydrodeoxygenation process. The mechanism for converting triglycerides or fatty acid feedstock is mainly based on the hydrogenation–hydrogenolysis–decarbonylation route with the Ni/ZrO2 or hydrogenation–hydrogenolysis–dehydration pathway over Ni/HBEA. Ni/ZrO2 or Ni/HBEA catalysts provide multi-functions for catalyzing the individual reaction steps involved in the overall cascade hydrodeoxygenation process.
“Ready-to-use” or “drop-in” hydrocarbon biofuels are potentially highly important energy carriers in the post fossil oil era. The high demand for new sustainable processes and catalysts for hydrocarbon production from high oxygen concentrations in biomass-derived feedstock suggests that deoxygenation becomes a key process. Understanding the fundamental chemistry in the deoxygenation process is highly desired, e.g. characterization of the surface chemistry and the state of the catalyst materials under reaction conditions by the spectroscopic method, investigation of the impact of solvent and reaction intermediates on the catalysts, and analysis of the kinetics of elementary steps in the overall cascade one-pot reaction. These insights will be of high value in synthesizing multifunctional catalysts into highly integrated processes.
