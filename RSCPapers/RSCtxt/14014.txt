    , Accepted 28th February 2013First published on 1st March 2013AbstractOrganic solar cells with short-circuit current densities and conversion efficiencies of ca. 7.0 mA cm−2 and 2.0%, respectively, have been fabricated with a very small molecular donor based on substituted triarylamines.
Electron donor materials based on conjugated molecules are subject to a growing interest in the general context of organic solar cells (OSCs).1–8 Compared to polydisperse low band gap co-polymers, molecular donors allow the definition of more reproducible procedures for the synthesis, purification, and processing of the materials. On the other hand, well-defined molecules appear as more suitable models for detailed analyses of the structure–property relationships that remain one of the major tools for the molecular engineering of new active materials.
During the past few years this approach has generated much research effort and donors derived from a large variety of basic structures have been proposed.1 Efficient donors for OSCs basically involve a combination of donor (D) and acceptor (A) units leading to an internal charge transfer which produces a narrowing of the optical band gap and thus an improvement of the light harvesting properties and in some cases, an increase of the open-circuit voltage of the OSC.2
Whereas donor materials based on symmetrical D–A–D or A–D–A, or even more complex combinations such as linear ADADA, DADAD or threefold symmetries, have led to conversion efficiencies in the 3–6% range,1 recent work has shown that additives such as diiodooctane or polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) can strongly contribute to increasing the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of solution-processed OSCs based on hybrid oligothiophenes to values ≥ 7.0%.3,4 As a counterpart of their sophisticated structure, these donor molecules generally present high molecular weights and require complex multi-step syntheses. On the other hand, some recent reports have shown that a high PCE can be obtained with a vacuum deposited OSC based on simple push–pull D–A systems.5–7 In this context, looking for donor materials combining reduced size, structural simplicity and low molecular weight appears to be an interesting problem. Beyond fundamental questions, the simplification of the structure of active materials can have important implications regarding the future economic and environmental aspects of the industrial fabrication of OSCs. In fact, simpler and smaller D–A systems can contribute to limiting the number of synthetic steps and hence the amount of side products, chemical and solvent waste, and to increase the overall yield of the target molecules.  
As a first step in this direction, we report here the synthesis of a series of D–A systems based on dicyanovinyl-derivatized triarylamines (1–5) as well as preliminary results on their evaluation in planar heterojunction OSCs with vacuum-deposited C60 as an acceptor. These molecules represent simplified versions of donor 1.7a As reported in a preliminary communication, this compound leads to a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 2.5% when used as a donor in a simple bilayer heterojunction with vacuum deposited C60 as an acceptor,7a while more recently a PCE of 4.0% was obtained with C70 as an acceptor.7a
Of course the shortening of the conjugated system resulting from the removal of an aromatic cycle in compound 1 will result in a hypsochromic shift of the absorption, and hence a decrease of the PCE. Consequently, it is clear that our aim here is not to improve the efficiency of compound 1, but rather to try to approach the simplest system still capable of producing photovoltaic conversion. In a further step, this minimal structure will serve as a starting platform for structural modifications aiming at the optimization of the relevant photovoltaic parameters (light-harvesting properties, energy levels of the frontiers orbitals) while trying to keep the structure as simple as possible.
Donors 2–6 have been synthesized by Knoevenagel condensation of malononitrile and aldehydes derived from various triarylamines (Scheme 1). All target compounds have been characterized by 1H and 13C NMR and HR mass spectrometries (see ESI†).

Table 1 lists the UV-Vis absorption and cyclic voltammetry data for compounds 2–6. As expected, removing the thienyl ring of compound 1 leads for compound 5 to a hypsochromic shift of the absorption maximum (λmax) from 501 to 473 nm. As shown by the data for compounds 2 and 3, replacement of a phenyl ring of TPA by a thienyl unit produces a ca. 30 nm bathochromic shift of λmax. On the other hand, replacement of the methoxy groups of compound 3 with a methyl group (4) or hydrogen (5) has only a minor influence on λmax. Finally, the data for compound 6 show that the bridging of the two phenyl rings into a carbazole block produces a 25 nm blue shift of λmax.

Except for 6, all compounds undergo reversible oxidation and irreversible reduction processes. As expected, removing the thiophene spacer of compound 1 leads to a 0.20 V positive shift of the anodic peak potential Epa for compound 5 due to the shortening of the conjugated system. However, contrary to expectations, the CV for compounds 2 and 3 shows that the replacement of a phenyl ring by a thienyl one produces a positive shift of the Epa. This surprising result is attributed to an enhancement of the charge transfer due to a planarization of the D–A system by the less sterically demanding thienyl group. As expected, compounds 3 and 4, with methyl and methoxy substituents, oxidize at lower potentials than 5. The CV of compound 6 presents a higher Epa, while the irreversible oxidation process is consistent with the well-known electrochemical polymerization of carbazoles.8
Theoretical calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) methods were performed with the Gaussian 09 program. Becke's three-parameter gradient-corrected functional (B3LYP) with the 6-31G(d,p) basis in vacuum was used to optimize the geometry and to compute the electronic structure at the minima found. As expected, the LUMO is essentially localized on the dicyanovinyl acceptor unit and the HOMO on the triarylamine donor block (see ESI†). However, comparison of the results for compounds 2 and 3 shows that replacing a phenyl cycle by a thienyl tends to displace the maximum coefficients towards the middle of the molecule. On the other hand, the data for compound 6 show that the bridging of two phenyl rings into a carbazole results in a significant increase of the HOMO coefficients on the carbazole block in agreement with the observed enhanced reactivity indicated by CV results.
The efficiencies of compounds 2–5 as donor materials for photovoltaic conversion have been evaluated on bilayer planar hetero-junction solar cells (PHJ) with a 0.28 cm2 active area.2 The cells were fabricated by spin-casting from chloroform solutions a film of donor of ca. 20 nm thickness on ITO substrates pre-coated by a 40 nm layer of PEDOT:PSS. A 30 nm layer of C60 was then vacuum deposited and the devices were completed by the deposition of a 100 nm aluminium electrode. The cells were then subjected to a 10 min thermal treatment at 110 °C. Although bulk hetero-junction OSCs lead to higher efficiency, such cells require the optimization of many experimental variables and consequently, bilayer PHJ cells appear as more convenient devices for a first analysis of structure–property relationships.

Fig. 1 shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectral response of the cells based on compounds 2, 4 and 5. These spectra show a first intense peak at around 360 nm attributed to the contribution of C60 to the photocurrent. This peak is followed by a broad wave in the 400–600 nm region and a weak shoulder around 630 nm. The EQE maxima in the visible spectral region are well correlated with the absorption maxima of the donors and show a progressive bathochromic shift from 460 to 475 and 485 nm for donors 2, 5 and 4, respectively. The maximum EQE increases from 45% for compound 2 to 65% for the non-substituted compound 5, which shows the highest efficiency among the series. The carbazole-based donor 6 (not shown) leads to a very weak EQE, whereas the cell based on compound 3 shows an EQE response identical to that of donor 4.

Fig. 2 shows the current vs. voltage curves of cells based on donors 2, 3 and 5 under AM 1.5 simulated solar illumination with a power light intensity of 90 mW cm−2. The cell based on donor 2 gave a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of ca. 3.00 mA cm−2 and an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.67 V, combined with a fill factor (FF) of 37% these results lead to a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 0.85% (Table 2). The results for cells based on compound 3 and 4 show that the introduction of a thienyl unit in the structure produces an increase of Jsc and FF, and a slight decrease of Voc, while PCE increases to 1.60–1.70%.

As expected from the EQE data, the carbazole based compound 6 leads to a low Jsc. The cell gives a high Voc of 1.10 V, consistent with CV data, but the lowest PCE among the series. Finally the best results were obtained with the cell based on donor 5 which gives a Jsc close to 7.0 mA cm−2 and a PCE of 1.92%. It is noteworthy that with a MW of 327, this molecule is, to the best of our knowledge, the smallest molecular donor capable to produce a substantial photocurrent reported to date.
Although these results may seem modest in view of the recently reported PCE values in the 7.0% range,3,4 they must be considered taking into consideration several important points namely (i) the nature of the acceptor material (C60vs. C70), (ii) the absence of additive, (iii) the un-optimized basic bilayer device used for evaluation, (iv) the relatively large active area (28 mm2), and before all the simplicity of the donor structure and good overall yield of the three-step synthesis (62%). Although due to their small conjugated structure these compounds present inherently limited light-harvesting properties, there is still room for improvement. For example Fitzner et al. have recently shown that the 2.60% PCE of a 2.85 mm2 multi-layer OCS based on a dicyanovinyl end-capped thiophene pentamer could be increased to 5.20% when implemented in a more advanced device architecture.9
To summarize, these preliminary results show that simple and easy-to-make substituted triarylamines possess a high potential as a starting platform for the molecular engineering of donor molecules with a good balance of efficiency, simplicity, high synthesis yield, and processing versatility (these materials can be processed by both solution–process and vacuum deposition techniques).7c Furthermore their simple structure represents a major advantage for detailed analyses of structure–property relationships and hence for the structural optimization of light harvesting properties, energy levels, and charge-transport. Work along these directions is now underway in our group and will be reported in future publications.
