    , Accepted 21st December 2012First published on 21st December 2012AbstractNickel diselenide (NiSe2) has been synthesized and applied as a counter electrode (CE) of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) for the first time, which displays remarkable catalytic activity in the reduction of I3−. The DSSC with a NiSe2 CE produces a higher power conversion efficiency (8.69%) than that (8.04%) of the cell with a Pt CE under the same conditions. A new method for comparing the catalytic activity has also been proposed.
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are promising photovoltaic devices for inexpensive large-scale solar energy conversion to electricity owing to their ease of fabrication and cost-effectiveness compared with silicon based solar cells. DSSCs have received considerable attention for further improving the overall performance in various aspects.1,2 A typical DSSC comprises a TiO2 nanocrystalline film sensitized with dye molecules, an electrolyte containing the iodide/triiodide (I−/I3−) redox couple, and a counter electrode (CE, typically the platinized conductive glass). When a DSSC works, the excited dye molecule injects an electron into the conduction band of TiO2 upon illumination, and the oxidized dye molecule is subsequently reduced back to the original neutral state by electron donation from I− ions in the electrolyte. The CE transfers electrons flowing from the external circuit to the redox electrolyte and catalyzes the reduction of I3− ions, which result from the oxidation of I− by the oxidized dye molecule.
A platinum (Pt) deposited conductive glass is usually employed as the CE due to its high conductivity, outstanding electrocatalytic activity, and good chemical stability.3 However, as a noble metal, the high cost and scarcity of Pt hinder the large-scale production of DSSCs. Consequently, numerous attempts have been made to exploit competent substitutes for Pt in order to reduce the overall cost and simultaneously keep the performance of DSSCs. In early research, various carbonaceous materials4–10 and conductive polymers11–14 have been proposed as cheap electrocatalysts for I3− reduction. However, these new catalysts can hardly compete with Pt in photovoltaic performance for DSSCs. Since Grätzel's group found that cobalt sulfide has excellent catalytic activity for the iodine-based redox couple,15 some sort of inorganic compounds have recently been applied as CE materials for DSSCs, such as sulfides,15–19 nitrides,20 carbides,21,22 and oxides.23
We have firstly demonstrated an in situ growth strategy to prepare Co0.85Se and Ni0.85Se CEs, and striking results were obtained.24 Ni0.85Se showed inferior catalytic activity than Pt. As the catalytic activity of nickel selenide may depend on the stoichiometric ratio, changing the stoichiometric ratio may improve the catalytic activity. Herein, we report another compound in nickel selenide series with a different stoichiometric ratio, nickel diselenide (NiSe2). NiSe2 was applied as a prominent Pt-free electrocatalyst for DSSCs for the first time, which showed better catalytic activity in the reduction of I3− than Pt.
More importantly, for estimating the intrinsic catalytic activity of different electrocatalysts, we propose a strict method to compare the electrocatalytic activity of various CEs. As the catalytic activity is related to the total surface area of the catalyst, the catalytic activity of different CE materials should be compared at the same total surface area, which is the product of the specific surface area and the loading amount of the catalyst, rather than the geometric area of electrodes. Therefore, the electrochemical behavior of various catalysts can be compared strictly at the same total surface area. Details of the fabrication method are shown in the experimental section of ESI.†
NiSe2 was prepared via a simple one-step hydrothermal reaction. The crystallographic structure of the as-prepared selenide was investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD). Fig. 1a shows the XRD patterns of the hydrothermal product, and the peaks can be well indexed to NiSe2 (PDF #65-1843). Furthermore, no other peaks of impurities were observed, indicating good purity of the synthesized sample. The elemental composition of the selenide powder was also detected by inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectra (ICP-AES). The result shows that the atomic ratio is 1.00:2.03 for Ni:Se, which is close to the stoichiometry of NiSe2. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) was employed to study the morphology of the prepared NiSe2. As shown in Fig. 1b, most NiSe2 particles with an average size of about 2–3 μm exhibit octahedral shape. The formation of octahedral crystals can be attributed to the effect of the crystal habit on the morphology.25

Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was carried out in a three-electrode system. Fig. 2a presents the cyclic voltammograms of the I−/I3− redox couple on NiSe2 and Pt CEs. Both curves exhibit two pairs of oxidation and reduction peaks (Ox-1/Red-1, Ox-2/Red-2, as labeled in Fig. 2a) in the range of −0.6 to 1.0 V (vs. Ag/Ag+). The left and right pairs are assigned to eqn (1) and (2), respectively. Apparently, the peaks of Ox-1 and Red-1 are at the focus of our analysis because the CE is responsible for catalyzing the reduction of I3− to I−. The cathodic and anodic peak current densities of the NiSe2 CE are higher than those of the Pt electrode, indicating that NiSe2 has higher catalytic activity than Pt. In addition, the value of peak to peak separation (Epp) is negatively correlated with the standard electrochemical rate constant of a redox reaction which is an important parameter for comparing catalytic activities of different CEs.8 The Epp value of the CV profile for NiSe2 CE (369 mV) is smaller than that for Pt CE (398 mV), which also confirms that NiSe2 is a prominent electrocatalyst for reduction of I3−, even better than Pt. (1) (2)

To further evaluate the catalytic activities of the NiSe2 and Pt electrodes, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed with symmetrical cells constructed with two identical CEs (CE/electrolyte/CE). According to the equivalent circuit (the inset of Fig. 2b), the high-frequency intercept on the real axis represents the series resistance (Rs). The charge-transfer resistance (Rct) at the CE/electrolyte interface and the corresponding phase angle element (CPE) give rise to the left semicircle (high frequency region).7,19 The right semicircle (low frequency region) is attributed to the Nernst diffusion impedance (ZN) of the redox couple in the electrolyte. The Nyquist plots for both CEs were fitted by the Z-view software, which gave the corresponding parameters as listed in Table 1. The Rct value for the NiSe2 electrode is 0.81 Ω cm2, which is lower than that for the Pt CE (0.97 Ω cm2) with the same total surface area. This means that NiSe2 is more active than Pt for reducing I3−. On the other hand, the Rs values for NiSe2 and Pt CEs are almost the same, whose effect on catalytic performance could be ignored. The value of ZN implies the iodide species diffusion rate in the electrolyte, which can be calculated using eqn (3)26 (3)where k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature, n is the number of electrons involved in the electrochemical reduction of I3− at the electrode, e0 is the elementary charge, c is the concentration of I3−, A is the electrode area, ω is the angular frequency, D is the diffusion coefficient of I3−, and δ is the thickness of the diffusion layer. The ZN values for NiSe2 and Pt CEs are 0.65 and 0.78 Ω cm2, respectively. As the symmetrical cells were tested under the same conditions, the D of I3− in the case of NiSe2 is larger than that in the case of Pt electrode according to eqn (3). For the same electrolyte, a larger D means that the electrode has higher electrocatalytic activity, because faster reduction of the I3− on the surface of catalyst can expedite the diffusion of I3− ions.26 (4) (5)

Tafel polarization measurement was also used to elucidate the electrocatalytic activity of CEs in the reduction of I3−. Fig. 2c shows the Tafel curves of the symmetrical cells which are the same as the ones used in the EIS measurement. The anodic and cathodic branches of the Tafel curve for NiSe2 loaded CE show a larger slope than that for Pt CE, indicating a higher exchange current density (J0) on this electrode according to the Tafel equation.22J0 could also be calculated using eqn (4), where Rct is the charge-transfer resistance obtained from EIS spectra, R is the gas constant and F is Faraday's constant. Apparently, the calculated J0 for Pt CE is lower than that for NiSe2 electrode, which is in good agreement with the Tafel polarization measurements. In addition, the information about limiting current density (Jlim) could also be obtained from the Tafel polarization curve. Obviously, the Jlim for NiSe2 CE is slightly higher than that for Pt electrode, which can be explained by the expression of Jlim and D shown in eqn (5), where NA is the Avogadro constant, l is the spacer thickness (here, l = 2δ), and other parameters have been interpreted. The D of I3− obtained from Jlim is also larger in the case of NiSe2 as compared to the Pt CE, which is consistent with the result obtained from the EIS analysis.15
Owing to the corrosivity of iodine-based electrolytes, the stability of electrocatalysts exposed to the redox couple is also a vital issue that must be concerned. The electrochemical stability of NiSe2 was investigated by the EIS spectra for the fresh and aged symmetrical cell with NiSe2 CE (Fig. 2d).7 The Rs and ZN hardly changed, while the Rct slightly increased from 0.81 to 0.96 Ω cm2, which indicates that NiSe2 has good corrosion resistance to the iodine-based electrolyte.
The DSSCs with different CEs were fabricated under the same conditions (see ESI†). Fig. 3a compares the photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the devices. The detailed photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. The DSSC with a NiSe2 loaded CE produced an excellent power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.69%, which is higher than that for the Pt based reference cell, mainly attributed to the higher short-circuit current density (Jsc) and fill factor (FF). As NiSe2 exhibits higher catalytic activity than Pt, it is reasonable that the former produced higher Jsc and FF. The IPCE spectra (Fig. 3b) of these DSSCs were also collected. The IPCEs of the N719-sensitized cells were maximized at around 530 nm. The NiSe2 CE based DSSC exhibited a slightly higher IPCE than the cell with a Pt CE between 400 and 600 nm, which is in good agreement with the difference of Jsc values.

In summary, NiSe2 was firstly used as an electrocatalyst for DSSCs, and a strict method for comparing the catalytic activity was proposed. By the direct comparison, NiSe2 showed outstanding catalytic activity in the reduction of triiodide, even better than Pt. The device based on NiSe2 CE produced a higher PCE (8.69%) than that (8.04%) of the cell with a Pt CE.
