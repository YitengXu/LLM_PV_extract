    , Accepted 1st August 2020First published on 3rd August 2020AbstractRecently, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs) has been increased rapidly owing to the introduction of a non-fullerene A–D–A type small-molecule acceptor. Thiophene is often used in A–D–A type small molecules as a conjugated bridge between the donor and acceptor parts in the backbone and to widen the intrachain conjugated length. Hence, by functionalizing the thiophenes with different groups, the photoelectric properties of A–D–A types of molecules can be further adjusted. However, there are few reports on the relations between backbone thiophene functionalization of A–D–A type small molecules and charge carrier mobility, which is important to further improve the performance of OPVs. By taking a small A–D–A type of molecule DCC3T as an example, we have functionalized the backbone thiophenes of DCC3T with different groups and modeled a series of small molecules DCC3T-X (X = H, CH3, CHCH2, OCH3, OH, NH2). The molecular packing and charge carrier mobility are studied by using reliable calculations of density functional theory (DFT), time-dependent DFT, and Marcus theory. The outcomes show that the electron and hole mobilities are exceedingly different among DCC3T-Xs. We find that the differences of charge carrier mobility can mainly be attributed to the change of molecular planarity and electronic structure, which significantly influence reorganization energy, molecular packing, and charge transfer integral. In addition, evident selective transportation phenomenon has been found in the modified DCC3T-Xs. The most striking finding is that functionalizing the backbone thiophenes with the oxygen-containing group –OCH3 could be a promising way to further improve the electron mobility of A–D–A type acceptors.
1. Introduction
Organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs), which are environmentally friendly, low-cost, foldable, and greatly tunable, have attracted extensive attention.1–4 Due to the usage of acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) type of small-molecule acceptor, such as IT-4F5 (3,9-bis(2-methylene-((3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-6,7-difluoro)-indanone))-5,5,11,11-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene, a bulky seven-ring fused core (IT), end-capped with 2FIC, where IT and 2FIC serve as the donor and acceptor parts, respectively), and Y66 (2,2′-((2Z,2′Z)-((12,13-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-3,9-diundecyl-12,13-dihydro-[1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4-e]thieno[2′′,3′′:4′,5′]thieno[2′,3′:4,5]pyrrolo[3,2-g]thieno[2′,3′:4,5]thieno[3,2-b]indole-2,10-diyl)bis(methanylylidene))bis(5,6-difluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-indene-2,1-diylidene))dimalononitrile, a bulky DAD structure, i.e. a seven-ring fused core (TPBT) end-capped with 2FIC, where TPBT and 2FIC serve as the donor and acceptor parts, respectively), the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of OPVs has been increased dramatically in the past few years.7–13 The success of A–D–A type small molecules can be attributed to the intramolecular “push–pull” structure arising from the terminal electron withdrawing (A) and central electron donating (D) moieties. The push–pull structure can produce strong intramolecular charge transfer, which can strengthen and broaden light absorption. Besides, due to the extended π-conjugation with the conjugated backbone, the absorption edge can be easily extended to the near-infrared region, which could substantially improve photocurrent generation. Furthermore, energy levels and the absorption energy can be adjusted easily by modifying the electron withdrawing or donating ability of the A or D parts, respectively.14,15
There have been many successful reports on the modification of the A or D parts of A–D–A type small molecules and their photoelectric performances have been significantly improved.12,13,16 Thiophene is often used as a bridge between the A and D parts in the backbone and to widen the intrachain conjugated length in A–D–A type small molecules, such as promising small organic molecule DRCN5T17 ((2,2′-[(3,3′′′,3′′′′,4′-tetraoctyl[2,2′:5′,2′′:5′′,2′′′:5′′′,2′′′′-quinquethiophene]-5,5′′′′-diyl)bis[(Z)-methylidyne(3-ethyl-4-oxo-5,2-thiazolidinediylidene)]]bis-propanedinitrile)dimalononitrile, where five thiophenes served as the donor part and π bridge simultaneously) and BTR18 (benzodithiophene terthiophene rhodamine, where three thiophenes served as a π bridge between the donor and acceptor). Experiments have indicated that functionalizing thiophene with different functional groups is a great way to further fine-tune A–D–A type molecules.19,20
At present, the reported functionalization on the backbone thiophenes of A–D–A type small molecules has mainly involved alkyl sidechains, and experiments have shown that it can improve the morphology and enhance charge carrier mobility.17,18,21 Both critically determine the PCE of OPVs. For instance, Zhu et al. found that the performance of devices based on BSFTR:Y6 was greatly influenced by morphology optimization, which affects the crystallinity, charge carrier mobility, and phase separation.22 Huang et al. reported a modification of Y6 (also named BTPTT-4F) by eliminating two terminal thiophene rings of TPBT (a bulky DAD structure, i.e. a seven-ring fused core of Y6, as mentioned before) and two side alkyl chains on the thiophenes from prototype Y6, and found that the morphology of the active layer after modification is much worse due to the lack of side chains, therefore the performance of solar cells based on the newly synthesized molecule (BTPT-4F) was significantly reduced (the PCE of the P2F-EHp:BTPT-4F OSC is only 1.09% while the PCE of the P2F-EHp: Y6 OSC is up to 16.02%).23 Wei et al. reported a solar cell device based on a new small molecule donor material named ZR1 and a Y6 acceptor, and confirmed that the hierarchical morphology in which the donor or acceptor rich domains, the donor crystals, and the donor–acceptor blends coexist can assist exciton dispersion and decrease the non-radiative voltage loss.24
However, there have been few reports on how other functionalization of backbone thiophenes influences the morphology and charge carrier mobility.25 Considering the importance of this topic, we chose a A–D–A type small molecule, DCC3T,26 to perform computational studies to explore the influence of thiophene functionalization on molecular packing and charge carrier mobility. DCC3T is suitable for this study because it is simply made up of DCCs (acceptor) and three backbone thiophenes, which served as donor and bridge parts, as shown in Fig. 1. Besides, efficient π–π stacking and good crystallinity of DCC3T derivates have been reported.26 Furthermore, a series of DCC3T-X (X = H, CH3, CHCH2, OCH3, OH, NH2) has been modeled and the photoelectric properties of these molecules have been investigated with first-principles calculations by our group.27 In this work, two methods of substitution are considered: (1) adding one functional group to each thiophene (single substitution, written as single), which is widely used in experiments;17,18,28 and (2) replacing all hydrogen atoms on thiophenes with new functional groups (double substitution, written as double), as shown in Fig. 1. Besides, the single substituted DCC3T-C6H13 is also modeled, because long alkyl side chains such as hexyl are often used in OPVs to improve solubility. For simplicity, the results of DCC3T-C6H13 are shown in the ESI.† Density functional theory (DFT), time-dependent DFT, and semi-classical Marcus theory29,30 are utilized to study the molecular packing and charge carrier mobility of these molecules.

2. Computational details
To simulate molecular packing, we modeled the dimer configurations of these functionalized molecules. This is a simple but very useful strategy considering that the morphology in the active layer can be regarded as the stacking of many dimers.31,32 To better simulate the molecular packing in the bulk film, we also tested the trimer configuration. The optimized trimer configuration is shown in the ESI† (Fig. S1). However, we found that the computational cost of trimer configurations is much more than that of dimer configurations. Besides, the way of molecular packing in trimer configurations is much more complex than that in dimer configurations. It is hard to fully consider all trimer configurations. Moreover, we have assumed that the charge carrier can only jump to the nearest sites, which is reasonable.33 Therefore, only dimer configurations that contain two neighboring monomers were considered in the present work. Different dimer configurations of DCC3T-CH3 have been optimized firstly, and the binding energy and electronic coupling of these configurations were calculated. After careful comparisons of those configurations, we find that the anti-parallel (U) configuration shows the largest binding energy and strong electronic coupling, indicating good stability. Hence, the U configuration is selected for further calculations. Besides, the parallel (G) configuration is also considered for comparison because this configuration is highly symmetrical and has the largest electron coupling for electronic transfer and the second largest electronic coupling for hole transfer, as shown in the ESI† (Fig. S2 and S3). The data of both parallel (G) and anti-parallel configurations are listed for comparison too. The structures of the U and G configurations of DCC3T-H are shown as typical examples in Fig. 2, and other DCC3T-X (X = CH3, CHCH2, OCH3, OH, NH2) dimers are shown in the ESI† (Fig. S4 and S5).

All quantum calculations were performed with the Gaussian 09 software package.34 The B3LYP35 functional was chosen for geometric optimization and reorganization energy calculation. This functional has been proved to be accurate for geometric optimization.36 Grimme's dispersion with the original D3 damping functional (GD3)37 was selected in the dimer geometric optimization. The 6-31G(d) basis set38 was chosen for all calculations. This combination can reproduce experimental geometry well.31,32,39 Range separated hybrid (RSH) functional CAM-B3LYP40 was selected to perform ground and excited state electronic structure calculations. Because the main purpose of the present work is to compare the influence of different substitutions, all calculations were performed in the gas phase.
The orbital decomposition, the calculation of the main transition, and qCT (the intramolecular transferred charge) of the excited state were performed by using the Multiwfn program41 based on Gaussian outputs, and the charge difference density maps (CDDs) were drawn by using IQmol.42
The semi-classical Marcus formula of the hopping model is written as29,30 (1)where V is the electronic coupling; kB is the Boltzmann constant; T is the absolute temperature and set to 298.15 K; ħ is the reduced Planck constant; and λ is the reorganization energy and only the inner reorganization energy is considered here (see Fig. 3).
The inner reorganization energy for electron transfer (ET) was calculated by:43 λe = λ0 + λ− = (E0* − E0) + (E−* − E−)(2)Similarly, for hole transfer (HT), it can be written as: λh = λ0 + λ+ = (E0* − E0) + (E+* − E+)(3)where E0*/E0 means the total energy of the neutral molecule in the optimized geometry of a charged/neutral molecule, respectively; and E±*/E± means the total energy of the charged molecule in the optimized geometry of the neutral/charged molecule, respectively.
The electronic coupling is defined by:44 (4)where Hif is the nondiagonal element of the two-state Hamiltonian matrix; Hii/Hff is the Hamiltonian of the initial/final state of charge transfer, respectively; Sif is the overlap between initial and final states. The overall electronic coupling is computed directly by using the “1 + 1” approach of the Q-Chem package,45 in which the zeroth order wavefunctions are composed of the Hartree–Fock wavefunctions of the two fragments.
The carrier mobility can be calculated using the Einstein–Smoluchowski formula:46 (5)where e is the elementary charge; D is the diffusion coefficient of the charge carrier; for a one-dimensional situation, D = r2k/2 (assuming that the charge carrier can only jump to its nearest neighbor sites and its successive jumps are uncorrelated);47r denotes the charge transfer distance between two adjacent molecules, which was estimated by the distance between the geometry centers of neighboring molecules; and k represents the charge transfer rate constant.

3. Results and discussion
3.1 Electronic structure and reorganization energy of monomers
To understand the effect of functional groups on the molecular planarity, the dihedral angles (α) between the central and terminal thiophenes and the dihedral angles (β) between the terminal thiophenes and the DCC part (as shown in Fig. 1) have been measured, and the average values of all α and β angles in these molecules are shown in Table 1. For original DCC3T-H, the dihedral angles are very small (α = 3.6°, β = 0.3°), showing good planarity. However, after modification, the planarity has been changed throughout. The dihedral angles are clearly increased in both single and double substitutions, except for DCC3T-OCH3, whose dihedral angles are close to those for DCC3T-H. It could be attributed to the S⋯O or H⋯π noncovalent intramolecular interactions between functionalized thiophenes in these compounds.48,49 The α angles of double substituted DCC3T-CH3 (63.5°) and DCC3T-CHCH2 (55.2°) are extremely large, leading to a transformation from trans- to cis-isomers, as shown in Fig. 4 and 5. In general, the planarity of single substituted molecules is better than that of double substituted molecules. However, for DCC3T-OH, the α in the single substituted molecule is almost five times larger than that in the double substituted one. Therefore, the functionalization of –OCH3 could have little influence on the molecular planarity, whereas the introduction of other groups breaks the molecular planarity.

The inner reorganization energy of electron transfer (λe) and hole transfer (λh) is shown in Table 1 and Fig. 1. The trend of the inner reorganization energy is roughly the same as that of dihedral angles. That is, the reorganization energy becomes larger towards worse planarity. For instance, the double substituted DCC3T-CH3 with large dihedral angles (α = 63.5°, β = 24.1°) has large λe and λh (λe = 0.42 eV, λh = 0.62 eV). In contrast, DCC3T-H with small dihedral angles (α = 3.6°, β = 0.3°) has small λe and λh (λe = 0.23 eV, λh = 0.17 eV). This phenomenon can be explained by the geometry of charged molecules. As shown in Table 1, the dihedral angles of charged molecules are smaller than those of neutral molecules due to intramolecular electrostatic interaction in charged molecules, especially for molecules with bad planarity. A large geometric difference between neutral and charged molecules produces large reorganization energy, as shown in eqn (2) and (3). For DCC3T-H, the difference between dihedrals of neutral and charged molecules is less than 3°. In contrast, for double substituted DCC3T-CH3, it is up to 40°, hence the reorganization energy of the former is evidently smaller than that of the latter. Note that the reorganization energy is contributed by a number of bonds, angles, and other parameters, thus, the comparison of α and β is only qualitatively right.
The frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs) are plotted in Fig. 4. To further explore the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) of these molecules during the optical excitation process, the amount of transferred charge (qCT), excitation energy (E − E0), and the CDD maps have been calculated, as shown in Fig. 5. Previous research studies have shown that the extended delocalization of FMOs can attenuate the inner reorganization energy, enhance electronic coupling, and ensure a lower optical gap.50–53 Specifically, the extended delocalization of HOMO/LUMO can attenuate the inner reorganization energy, enhance the coupling with an adjacent molecule, and therefore is favorable for hole/electron transfer, respectively.54,55 Indeed, as shown in the ESI† (Fig. S6), DCC3T-H has the best delocalized FMOs and the lowest inner reorganization energy compared with DCC3T-Xs. Generally, the reorganization energy is smaller towards better planarity because a better planarity is favorable for electron delocalization. For instance, for the double substituted DCC3T-CH3 with poor planarity and localized distribution of FMOs, the reorganization energy is extremely large (λe = 0.42 eV, λh = 0.62 eV), while for single substituted DCC3T-CH3 with improved planarity and better delocalized FMOs, the reorganization energy is much smaller (λe = 0.32 eV, λh = 0.19 eV), as shown in Table 1.
We have also performed analyses of the electronic structures of the excited states of these molecules, see Fig. 5 (and the ESI† (Fig. S7) for DCC3T-H). One can see that for double substituted DCC3T-CH3 and DCC3T-CHCH2, the hole and electron are almost located separately, leading to strong electron–hole electrostatic interactions, i.e. large excitation energy. For other molecules, the electron and hole are well delocalized and mixed; the excitation energies are smaller than those of double substituted DCC3T-CH3 and DCC3T-CHCH2. The orbital contributions of the first excited states of these molecules are explored. As one can see, the percentages of the HOMO → LUMO transition are clearly related to the planarity. The contributions of HOMO → LUMO transitions are larger towards better planarity. The reorganization energy, dihedral angles, FMOs and DCC maps of DCC3T-C6H13 are shown in the ESI† (Fig. S8 and S9), and they are very close to those of DCC3T-CH3, indicating that the long alkyl side chain has little effect on the properties of the monomer. Moreover, the qCTs of all functionalized DCC3T-Xs are larger than those of DCC3T-H, which indicates that the ICT is enhanced by functionalization. This would be beneficial to intermolecular charge transfer and light absorption.
3.2 Binding energy and charge transfer distance of dimers
The binding energy of dimers has been calculated, as shown in Fig. 6. It is defined as: Ebinding = 2Emonomer − Edimer, where Emonomer/dimer is the total energy of the monomer/dimer, respectively. Note that we do not calculate the basis set superposition error (BSSE) in this work because previous works have confirmed that the BSSE does not change the trend of the binding energy of these small molecules.31,56 The binding energy of U configurations is clearly larger than that of G configurations, suggesting that U configurations are superior in terms of stability. Besides, all substituted molecules show larger binding energy than DCC3T-H. The charge transfer distance was estimated by using the geometry center distance. As shown in Fig. 6, the geometry center distance becomes larger towards the worst planarity, except for DCC3T-CH3(G) and DCC3T-NH2(G). Generally speaking, a short charge transfer distance is beneficial for enhancing electronic coupling, while a large charge transfer distance is favorable for large carrier mobility, as shown in eqn (5). Thus, achieving large charge carrier mobility should ensure enhanced electronic coupling and long charge transfer distance simultaneously.

3.3 Electronic coupling and charge carrier mobility of dimers
Electronic coupling represents the overlap between molecular orbitals of the neighboring molecules, and is vital for charge carrier mobility. The one-dimensional charge carrier mobility has been calculated by assuming that the charge carrier can only jump to its nearest neighbor sites and its successive jumps are uncorrelated. This is reasonable because the longer range interactions are negligible when compared to the interactions between the nearest neighbor sites.47 The electronic coupling, charge transfer rate constant, charge carrier mobility, and other related parameters are listed in Table 2. For U configurations, the dimer of double substituted DCC3T-OCH3(U) has the largest Ve (173.54 meV) and the dimer of DCC3T-H(U) shows the largest Vh (86.53 meV). The difference in electronic coupling between different molecules is extremely large, for example, compared with DCC3T-H(U) and double substituted DCC3T-OCH3(U), the electronic couplings of the single substituted DCC3T-NH2(U) are extremely small (Ve = 0.66 meV, Vh = 4.42 meV). This difference can be explained by using the electron density distribution of FMOs of dimers, as shown in the ESI† (Fig. S10). For the single substituted DCC3T-NH2, the FMOs are delocalized on a single molecule, and the HOMO (LUMO+1) and HOMO−1 (LUMO) are distributed on the opposite sides, leading to small orbital interactions and small electronic coupling. For DCC3T-H(U) and double substituted DCC3T-OCH3(U), because of the extended delocalization of FMOs of monomers and short geometry center distance (see Fig. 4 and 7), the FMOs of the dimer are separated on two molecules with high symmetry, indicating a strong interaction between the neighboring molecules, thus, the electronic coupling is extremely large. Especially, for double substituted DCC3T-OCH3(U), though the charge transfer distance of the double substituted DCC3T-OCH3(U) is slightly larger than DCC3T-H(U), the hybridization between the LUMOs of the two monomers is extremely larger than that in DCC3T-H(U). The single substituted DCC3T-CHCH2(U) and the double substituted DCC3T-OH(U) also have large Vhs (81.34 meV for DCC3T-CHCH2 and 63.85 meV for DCC3T-OH). Because of the largest coupling and small reorganization energy, the double substituted DCC3T-OCH3(U) has the largest electron mobility (1.24 cm2 V−1 s−1) and DCC3T-H(U) has the largest hole mobility (1.47 cm2 V−1 s−1). Besides, the double substituted DCC3T-OH(U) has the second largest hole mobility (0.55 cm2 V−1 s−1) due to the small reorganization energy. On the other hand, for G configurations, DCC3T-H(G) has the largest electron mobility (0.55 cm2 V−1 s−1), while the single substituted DCC3T-OH(G) has the largest hole mobility (0.59 cm2 V−1 s−1). For non-planar DCC3T-Xs, such as the double substituted DCC3T-CH3, DCC3T-CHCH2 and DCC3T-NH2, and the single substituted DCC3T-CHCH2, only the single substituted DCC3T-CHCH2(G) shows a hole mobility of up to 0.41 cm2 V−1 s−1, the charge carrier mobilities of those molecules are obviously smaller than those of other molecules with good planarity. This can be explained with molecular planarity: the weak planarity leads to large inner reorganization energy, weak molecular packing, small electronic coupling, and eventually small charge carrier mobility. Also, due to weak planarity, the mobility of the cis-isomers, i.e. double substituted DCC3T-CH3 and DCC3T-CHCH2, are substantially smaller than those of other isomers with good planarity.

 Fig. 7  The charge transfer distance between monomers in the DCC3T-X dimer optimized via the B3LYP(GD3)/6-31G(d) level of theory. Blue-triangle mark: single substitution; orange-square mark: double substitution; red-square mark: DCC3T-H. 
We have noticed that some molecules show evident selective transportation properties, such as single substituted DCC3T-OCH3, DCC3T-OH, and DCC3T-NH2, and double substituted DCC3T-CHCH2 and DCC3T-OH. Their hole mobility is obviously larger than their electron mobilities, i.e. μe/μh ≪ 1, as shown in Table 2. The same phenomenon of selective transportation has been reported by previous experiments.57,58 This selectivity can be attributed to the distribution of FMOs: for single substituted DCC3T-OCH3, DCC3T-OH, and DCC3T-NH2, and double substituted DCC3T-CHCH2 and DCC3T-OH, the electron density of HOMOs is distributed across the right DCC terminal group and three thiophene rings, while the electron density of LUMOs is mainly localized on the left DCC terminal group and the left thiophene. These results suggest that the HOMOs of these molecules are more delocalized than LUMOs, as shown in Fig. 4. For double substituted DCC3T-CHCH2, the electron density of the HOMO is distributed across three thiophene rings, while the electron density of the LUMO is only localized on the right DCC terminal group. Thus, these molecules indicate selectivity to hole transport. On the other hand, both single and double substituted DCC3T-CH3 show obvious selective electron transportation. The reason is that the electron density of the LUMO of the single substituted DCC3T-CH3 is delocalized better than that of the HOMO, and the λh (0.62 eV) of double substituted DCC3T-CH3 is noticeably larger than the λe (0.42 eV), as shown in Fig. 4 and Table 1. In general, the selective transportation of charge carriers can be mainly attributed to the geometric and electronic structure of the monomer.
Moreover, μe/μh is very sensitive to the dimer configuration. For the same molecules, the differences in the μe/μh (or μh/μe) between U and G configurations are extremely large, such as DCC3T-H, single substituted DCC3T-CHCH2 and DCC3T-NH2, and the double substituted DCC3T-CH3, DCC3T-NH2, and DCC3T-OH. In particular, the μh (0.55 cm2 V−1 s−1) of double substituted DCC3T-OH(U) is three orders of magnitude larger than μe (1.87 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1), while for another dimer, i.e. double substituted DCC3T-OH(G), the μh (1.4 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) is close to μe (2.26 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1). It can be explained by using eqn (1), which includes reorganization energy (λ) as the exponent and the square of electronic coupling (V). A slight change of λ or V can lead to a significant change in rate constant (k). Apart from that, the λh (0.21 eV) of double substituted DCC3T-OH is 0.05 eV smaller than λe (0.26 eV), and the Vh (63.85 meV) is about forty times larger than Ve (1.63 meV). As a result, the kh (1.92 × 1013 s−1) is four orders of magnitude larger than ke (6.57 × 109 s−1). The difference between λe and λh can be attributed to molecular planarity, as discussed in the previous part. But for dimer configurations of the same molecule, λe and λh, are the same for rate constant calculation. Hence, a significant difference in μe/μhs between the U and G configurations of the same molecule can be mainly attributed to the electronic coupling. As shown in the ESI,† Fig. S4, S5 and S10, for the double substituted DCC3T-OH(U), the π–π stacking between two molecules is mainly contributed by the three thiophene rings, and the distance between the central thiophenes is much shorter than that of terminal DCCs. In addition, as shown in Fig. 4, the electron density of the HOMO of the double substituted DCC3T-OH is mainly distributed on central thiophenes, while the electron density of the LUMO is mainly located on the right terminal DCC; therefore, the interaction between the HOMOs of the two molecules is much larger than that of the LUMOs. Consequently, the hybridization of two HOMOs of double substituted DCC3T-OH molecules in the U configuration is much better than that of two LUMOs, hence the Vh (63.85 meV) is significantly larger than Ve (1.63 meV). For double substituted DCC3T-OH(G), the π–π stacking between two neighboring molecules is weaker than that of the U configuration, and the distance between terminal DCCs is much closer, hence, the interaction between two LUMOs of monomers in the G configuration is enhanced, and the Ve (56.81 meV) is obviously much larger. Therefore, the significant difference in μe/μhs between different dimer configurations can be attributed to the molecular packing and the distribution of the electron density of the FMOs of the monomer: the molecular packing determines the whereabouts of the interaction between neighboring molecules, while the distributions of the electron density of the HOMOs and LUMOs of the neighboring molecules determines the values of Vh and Ve, which can further determine μe and μh.
Moreover, the geometry center distance, binding energy, and charge carrier mobility of the single substituted DCC3T-C6H13 are shown in the ESI,† Fig. S11 and Table S1. The μe values of DCC3T-C6H13 (2.2 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the U configuration, and 1.33 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the G configuration) are comparable with those of the single substituted DCC3T-CH3, while the μh values of DCC3T-C6H13 (0.32 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the U configuration, and 0.11 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the G configuration) are significantly larger than those of the single substituted DCC3T-CH3. The results indicate that DCC3T-Xs studied in the present work can be further improved by long alkyl chain substitution.
Note that our results of one-dimensional charge carrier mobilities might be larger than the experimental results, because only the most possible charge transport pathways are considered in this work. Overall, the best donor/acceptor material seems to be DCC3T-H/DCC3T-OCH3(double), respectively, according to the calculated charge mobility and the stability of the U configurations of the dimer.
4. Conclusions and outlook
In conclusion, by utilizing reliable DFT, TDDFT and Marcus theory, the electronic structure, molecular packing of dimers, and charge carrier mobility of a series of functionalized A–D–A type small molecules DCC3T-X (X = H, CH3, CHCH2, OCH3, OH, NH2) have been studied. The outcomes suggest: (1) functionalizing the backbone thiophenes with oxygen-containing groups such as –OCH3 is a promising method because it can maintain good molecular planarity and has high electron mobility; DCC3T-OCH3 could be an excellent acceptor. (2) DCC3T-H seems to be a good donor or material for hole transfer layer of OSC because it has high hole mobility. (3) This work suggests that backbone thiophene functionalization on A–D–A type molecules is a promising way to fine-tune the photoelectric performance of these molecules. (4) An evident selective transportation phenomenon has been observed in the modified DCC3T-Xs, which is closely related to the molecular packing and electronic structure of the monomer. It is worth pointing out that in the real heterojunction-based devices, the molecular packing is much complicated than that modelled in this work. However, this work is still valuable as it gives a guideline for the future design of A–D–A molecules.
In the future, we plan to run classical molecular simulations to obtain insight into the morphology of these molecules in thin films, and functionalize the popular A–D–A type non-fullerene acceptor Y6 with an –OCH3 group and test its performance.
