Introduction
Hematite has emerged as a good photocatalyst for efficient solar water splitting due to its favorable optical band gap (2.1–2.2 eV), extraordinary chemical stability in oxidative environment, abundance, and low cost.1–10 According to theoretical prediction, the solar-to-hydrogen efficiency of hematite can be 16.8% and the water splitting photocurrent can be 12.6 mA cm−2.4 However, the practical performance of hematite for solar water splitting is far from the ideal case which has been limited by several factors such as poor conductivity, short lifetime of the excited-state carrier (10−12 s), poor oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics, short hole diffusion length (2–4 nm), and improper band position for unassisted water splitting.5–10
Enormous efforts have been focused on improving the performance of hematite photoelectrode.3–16 Different methods such as morphology control,6,9,12 elemental doping,16,17 or improvement of the charge transport of hematite have been reported to be effective way for better performance.15 In all these methods, the synthesis of hematite plays a key role for the performance of hematite. Up to now, various synthesis methods have been used to prepare hematite nanostructures such as spray pyrolysis,18 sol–gel,19 hydrothermal6 and atmosphere pressure chemical vapor deposition (APCVD).6,9 However, a facile and cheap synthesis method of hematite nanostructures with high efficiency is still on the way for future large scale application.20,21
Here we report a facile synthesis of hematite nanostructures for solar water splitting via a simple pyrolysis of ferrocene under ambient pressure. The photocurrent of the hematite nanostructures can be 2.1 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE. In literature, ferrocene was also used as the synthesis source of hematite in APCVD method.22 However, the obtained hematite showed a very poor performance with a maximal photocurrent density less than 1 mA cm−2. Here our synthesis method is much easier and the photocurrent is relatively high. The facile synthesis of hematite nanostructures could be a start for further treatment such as elemental doping to achieve high performance in practical applications.
Experimental section
Preparation of α-Fe2O3 photoanodes
0.15 g of ferrocene (J&K Scientific, 99%) was sintered at different temperatures in a range from 250 °C to 650 °C for 2 hours in a crucible (15 cc) covered by a 40 × 40 × 2 mm fluorine-doped SnO2 glass (FTO, Nippon Sheet Glass, Japan, 14 ohm sq−1). The FTO glass with the conducting side facing down was cleaned with acetone, ethanol and deionized water. A layer of red color film formed on the FTO glass after sintering. Illustration of the experimental set up can be found in the bottom panel of Fig. 1. For PEC measurements, the FTO glass was cut into 10 × 20 × 2 mm pieces and then annealed at 750 °C for 10 min.

Structural characterization
The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of hematite nanostructures were taken on a FEI-quanta 200 scanning electron microscope with acceleration voltage of 20 kV. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), High-Resolution TEM (HRTEM) images and energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX) spectroscopy were obtained with a FEI/Philips Techai 12 BioTWIN transmission electron microscope and a CM200 FEG transmission electron microscope, respectively. Hematite samples for TEM were scratched from the surface at different locations with a razor blade and transferred onto a holey carbon thin film supported by a copper grid. X-Ray Diffractometer (XRD, Shimadzu XRD-6000) and X-ray photoelectron Spectrometer (XPS, Kratos AXIS Ultra DLD) were also used for the structure characterization. X-Ray absorption spectroscopy experiments were performed at the Soft X-ray Spectroscopy station of the Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility (BSRF) and at Beamline 14W of the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF). The spectra were recorded at room temperature with a resolution of 0.3 eV at the O K-edges with the total electron yield (TEY) detection mode.
PEC measurements
Hematite photoanodes on FTO substrate were covered by non-conductive hysol epoxy except for a working area of 0.1 cm2. All PEC measurements were carried out using CHI 660D electrochemical workstation in a three-electrode electrochemical cell with a Pt wire as a counter electrode and an Ag/AgCl electrode as a reference. The electrolyte was an aqueous solution of NaOH with a pH of 13.6, bubbled with N2 for 20 min before measurement. The measured voltage was converted into the potential vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). In a typical experiment, the potential was swept from 0.7 V to 1.8 V vs. RHE at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. Xenon High Brightness Cold Light Sources (XD-300) coupled with a filter (AM 1.5 G) were used as the white light source and the light power density of 100 mW cm−2 (spectrally corrected) was measured with a power meter (Newport, 842 PE). IPCE were measured using a xenon lamp (CEL-HXF300/CEL-HXBF300, 300W) coupled with a monochromator (Omni-λ3005). Capacitance was derived from the electrochemical impedance obtained at each potential with 1000 Hz frequency in the dark. Mott–Schottky plots were generated from the capacitance values. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurement was carried out in the same workstation with a frequency range of 1–100 kHz at the potential of 1.23 V vs. RHE.
Results and discussion
Hematite nanostructures were synthesized by the pyrolysis of ferrocene in a crucible covered by a 40 × 40 × 2 mm fluorine-doped SnO2 glass. The detailed experiments are described in Experimental Section. Illustration of the experimental set up can be found in the bottom of Fig. 1. The melting and boiling point of ferrocene is 172.5 °C and 249 °C, respectively. When the temperature is higher than 400 °C, ferrocene will sublime and then decompose to form hematite with the oxidation of air. A layer of red color film can be observed on the FTO glass after sintering. In the bottom panel of Fig. 1, a photo of the covered FTO glass after the pyrolysis of ferrocene at 550 °C for 2 h has been shown at the right side. It is clear that the FTO glass is covered by a red layer. However, the center part shows a light red color (more than 80% of the circle area) while the edge part (around the circle) shows a dark red color. We labeled the center part hematite nanostructures on FTO glass with CH while the edge part with EH in the image.
In Fig. 1a and b we show the SEM images of CH and EH sintered at 550 °C for 2 h, while in Fig. 1c and d the SEM images of CH and EH after additional annealing at 750 °C for 10 min are shown. In Fig. 1a and c uniform morphology of hematite nanostructures can be observed covering the FTO substrate, similar to hematite nanostructures prepared by other methods such as hydrothermal synthesis.6 The thickness of the hematite film is also measured by SEM and the results are shown in the ESI S2.† Both CH and EH have similar thickness of about 25 ± 5 nm.
X-Ray diffraction (XRD) data for CH and EH sintered at 550 °C and then annealed at 750 °C are also shown in the ESI S1,† which can be indexed to the characteristic peaks of typical hematite (JCPDS 33-0664) after subtracting the SnO2 peaks from the FTO substrate.
The photocurrent density-applied potential (J–V) scan for the center part hematite (CH) sintered at 550 °C and then annealed at 750 °C was measured with the AM 1.5 G simulated solar light at 100 mW cm−2 and shown in Fig. 2a. For comparison, the curve for EH was also shown. Photoelectrochemical (PEC) measurements were performed in 1 M NaOH electrolyte (pH = 13.6) using a three-electrode electrochemical cell with hematite nanostructures on FTO as the working electrode, a platinum coil as the counter electrode, and a reference of Ag/AgCl (reported with respect to the reversible hydrogen electrode, RHE). More details for the measurement can be found in Experimental Section. In Fig. 2a the curve for EH shows a relatively low photocurrent density of 0.5 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE, while for CH, the photocurrent density at 1.23 V vs. RHE drastically increases to 2.1 mA cm−2, which is more than 4 times higher than that for EH sintered at the same temperature. Up to now, various methods have been used to prepare hematite for high efficiency solar water splitting. By APCVD a remarkable photocurrent density of over 3 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V versus RHE has been reported with a cauliflower-type hematite nanostructure with iridium oxide catalyst.9 Recently, Ti-doped hematite nanostructures prepared by a repeated deposition-annealing process were also reported to achieve a high photocurrent density of 2.8 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V versus RHE.16 Here by a facile method, our hematite nanostructures also show a good photocurrent of 2.1 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V versus RHE. The simple synthesis may serve as a good start for further treatment to achieve higher performance and might be used for large scale application.
 Fig. 2  (a) J–V scans for EH (dash line) and CH (solid line) sintered at 550 °C and then annealed at 750 °C. (b) IPCE spectra for EH and CH measured at the incident light wavelength range from 350 to 650 nm at 1.23 V vs. RHE. 
Incident photon-to-current conversion efficiencies (IPCE) for EH and CH were measured at 1.23 V vs. RHE as a function of incident light wavelength and the data are plotted in Fig. 2b. CH shows enhanced IPCE values compared to EH at all measured wavelengths, which are consistent with the J–V curves. The highest IPCE measured for CH is about 50% (at a wavelength of 370 nm). The IPCE for both samples are especially low in the long-wavelength range because the quantum yield for converting photons with energies close to the hematite band edge is low.15,23 The integrated photocurrent based on the IPCE data has also been shown in the ESI (Fig. S3†), which reaches 2.0 mA cm−2 for CH and is similar to the PEC measurement.
To explore the sintering temperature effect in the pyrolysis process, XRD spectra and J–V curves for CH sintered from 250 °C to 650 °C and then annealed at 750 °C for 10 min have also been shown in the ESI (Fig. S4 and S5†). XRD data show that the obtained nanostructures sintered from 250 °C to 650 °C are all hematite phase. The photocurrent density drastically increases with sintering temperature, with a maximal value at 550 °C and a sudden drop at 650 °C. Data suggests that 550 °C can be a favorable temperature for the preparation of hematite nanostructures.
CH and EH were prepared by the same process but showed different PEC performance due to different locations on the FTO glass. To reveal the different structure between CH and EH, High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscope (HRTEM) images of CH and EH are shown in Fig. 3a and b, respectively. Interestingly, a thin coating layer (thickness of ∼2 nm) on the surface of CH can be easily observed (indicated by the two black arrows), while no layer can be observed for EH. Elemental mapping and EDX spectrum for CH are also shown in Fig. 4, which clearly indicate that a thin carbon layer is coated on the surface of hematite nanostructures. Elemental mapping and EDX spectrum for EH are also shown in the ESI (Fig. S6†) indicating no carbon layer.

Since the hematite nanostructures were prepared by the pyrolysis of ferrocene, carbon in ferrocene may be involved in the obtained hematite and the center of the FTO glass (CH) is more favorable for the carbon deposition than the edge due to the different geometry. Also the center part (CH) is exposed to limited oxygen in the crucible while the edge part (EH) is surrounded by more oxygen involving that outside the crucible, thus a carbon layer on CH can be left more easily instead of a thorough oxidation to be gas molecules such as CO2 for EH.
The stability and sustainability of the photocurrent were also tested with the curve of photocurrent vs. time at 1.23 V shown in the ESI S7.† The current is quite stable, which suggests that the photocurrent is from water oxidation ruling out the possibility of the oxidation of the carbon coating layer.
Mott–Schottky curves were also plotted in Fig. 5 to understand the difference between CH and EH. The slopes from the Mott–Schottky plots were used to estimate the carrier densities using the equation:Nd = (2/e0εε0)[d(1/C2)/dV]−1where e0 is the electron charge (1.602 × 10−19 C), ε is the dielectric constant of α-Fe2O3 (80),17ε0 is the permittivity of vacuum (8.854 × 10−14 Fm−1). Nd is the donor density and V is the potential applied at the electrode. Capacitances were derived from the electrochemical impedance obtained at each potential with 1000 Hz frequency in the dark. The Mott–Schottky slopes of both samples are positive which indicates that they are n-type semiconductors with electrons as majority carriers. The carrier densities were estimated from the Mott–Schottky plots (see ref. 17) and the results show that the donor density of CH is 1.07 × 1020 cm−3, while for EH it is 6.17 × 1018 cm−3. The electron density of CH hematite is about 2 orders magnitude higher than that of EH. Data clearly indicate that CH has a better conductivity than EH.

CH sample shows a carbon coating layer and higher conductivity. To further reveal the mechanism of the enhanced photocurrent, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray absorption spectra (XAS) were employed to elucidate the electronic structure difference between CH and EH. The XPS results have been shown in Fig. 6a–d. In the survey scan of XPS shown in Fig. 6a, Fe and O signal can be clearly resolved standing for hematite. Sn signal can also be observed which is from the FTO substrate. For both CH and EH, C signal can be identified. The C signal for EH is weak standing for the adsorbed carbon contamination in air. However, strong C signal can be observed for CH, which stands for coated carbon layer on hematite nanostructures in good agreement with the TEM results. In Fig. 6b we also show the C 1s XPS spectra of EH and CH. Obviously, C signal in CH is enhanced than that in EH. The C signal for CH shows clear features around 286.7 and 289 eV, indicating the presence of C–O bonds in hematite nanostructures. O 1s XPS spectra are shown in Fig. 6c. For EH the binding energies of the main lines (529.9 eV) is similar to the literature for hematite,16 while for CH the peak around 529.9 eV decreases a lot indicating less oxidized Fe content. In Fig. 6d the Fe 2p XPS spectra have been shown. Interestingly, CH shows a lower binding energy than EH, indicating a low oxidation state with less oxygen content. A small peak for Fe2+ can also be observed. With the carbon coating, hematite nanostructures will be exposed to less oxygen and a low oxidation state of Fe with less oxygen content in hematite can be observed. The influence of oxygen content in hematite nanostructures can contribute to the PEC performance by increasing the donor density as reported in literature.11,16 The XPS data strongly suggest that the remarkable photocurrent in CH sample can be related to the carbon coating which may result in more oxygen vacancy by consuming oxygen in the crucible and protecting the hematite from complete oxidation in the annealing process.11 The pyrolysis process can be simply described by the following equations:

(c) High-resolution O 1s XPS spectra of EH and CH. (d) High-resolution Fe 2p XPS spectra of EH and CH. (e) O K-edge XAS spectra of EH and CH. The inset shows the normalized prepeaks. 
X-Ray absorption spectra of EH and CH at O K-edge were also measured in Fig. 6e. XAS is an element-specific spectroscopic technique involving the excitation of electrons from a core level to local and partial empty states of a defined character, which is a useful tool to probe the electronic structure of materials. XAS data have been collected on the soft X-ray beamline at the Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility. In Fig. 6e the XAS spectrum of EH shows typical hematite features such as two separated prepeaks A1 and A2, the main peak B2 and a small shoulder B1. The prepeak can be attributed to transitions to antibonding O 2p states hybridized with the 3d metal states, mainly localized at the Fe site.24 Feature B can be generally attributed to oxygen 2p states hybridized with iron 4s and 4p states.24 Compared to the spectrum of EH, the O K-edge spectrum of CH shows significant differences such as the decrease of the prepeaks (A1 and A2) and the increase of the shoulder B1. The spectral differences can be assigned to the contribution of FeO with less oxygen content, as shown in literature.24 Moreover, the inset in Fig. 6e shows the normalized prepeak of EH and CH and a broadened peak A2 for CH can be observed confirming the existence of FeO. The O K-edge XAS results clearly show that the carbon-coated hematite nanostructures in CH have less oxygen content with some contents of low oxidation state of Fe2+, which is consistent with the XPS results. XAS data at Fe K-edge also confirm the results (data not shown). The carbon-coated hematite nanostructures in CH have more oxygen vacancy, which improve the photocurrent by increasing the donor density.
Conclusions
We presented the preparation of carbon-coated hematite nanostructures by a simple pyrolysis of ferrocene under ambient pressure. The hematite nanostructures show a remarkable photocurrent of 2.1 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE for solar water splitting. By comparing the hematite nanostructures from different locations on the obtained FTO glass, we find that the enhanced photocurrent for the center hematite can be attributed to oxygen vacancy in hematite nanostructures which is related to the carbon coating layer induced from the decomposition of ferrocene. The facile synthesis of carbon-coated hematite nanostructures may serve as a good start for further treatment to achieve higher performance and might be used for large scale application.

Hematite has emerged as a good photocatalyst for efficient solar water splitting. Various methods have been used to prepare high efficiency hematite nanostructures. However, a facile and cheap synthesis method of hematite nanostructures with high efficiency is critical for future practical application. Here we report a facile synthesis of hematite nanostructures for solar water splitting via a simple pyrolysis of ferrocene under ambient pressure. The photocurrent of the carbon-coated hematite nanostructures can be 2.1 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE, compared to a value of 0.5 mA cm−2 for hematite without the carbon layer. The carbon layer is a few nm thick covering the surface of hematite nanostructures. X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy and X-ray absorption spectroscopy revealed that the electronic structure of hematite was significantly modified with the existence of oxygen vacancy, which was responsible for the remarkable photocurrent. The carbon layer plays an important role for the appearance of oxygen vacancy. The simple and cheap method could be scaled up easily which may pave the way for the practical application for efficient solar water splitting.
