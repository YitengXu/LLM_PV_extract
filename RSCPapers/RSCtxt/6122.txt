    , Accepted 4th April 2014First published on 7th April 2014AbstractNatural gas is envisioned as a primary source of hydrocarbons in the foreseeable future. With the abundance of shale gas, the main concerns have shifted from the limited hydrocarbon availability to the sustainable methods of CH4 conversion to fuels. This is necessitated by high costs of natural gas transportation in its native gaseous form. Conventional gas-to-liquid conversion technologies are capital and scale intensive and can hardly be envisioned in their current form to be cost efficient in the remote locations of the natural gas extraction sites. Solar energy can be utilized at the gas extraction site to perform catalytic CH4 conversion using electrons obtained via photovoltaics or directly with photons. We provide broader insight into the catalytic CH4 conversion methods that utilize renewable energy via photo(electro)catalytic processes, with particular focus on the catalytic materials used, reaction conditions and intermediates, as well as their selectivity. Based on the currently available scientific literature, we propose several hybrid catalytic CH4 conversion processes based on both conventional and renewable – photo(electro)chemical – catalysis.

1. Introduction
Natural gas, with its major component CH4, is and will be in the foreseeable future the main source of hydrocarbons for energy and fuels.1 Total proven natural gas resources alone in 2012 were 6845 TCF (trillion cubic feet).2 While it is difficult to predict the exact recoverable gas amounts, current estimations lead to the belief that together with shale gas, it could lead to energy independence for many countries for the decades to come if the resulting increase in the CO2 footprint can be mitigated. For example, U.S. shale gas production has been projected to increase from 5 TCF in 2010 to 13.6 TCF in 2035, with the latter accounting for 49% of total USA dry gas production.3 China's proven shale gas reserves are estimated to be 885 TCF – nearly 200 times its annual gas consumption.4 With the emergence of shale gas, a major paradigm shift occurred when crude oil and natural gas stopped mirroring one another in their price trends (in dollars per million Btu)5 with natural gas becoming significantly cheaper. Finally, methane hydrates, which are difficult to access crystalline formations containing CH4, are estimated to account for 317832 TCF in the USA alone, well beyond the current and future demand for natural gas.6 From the catalysis science and technology point of view, this availability of CH4 results in renewed interest in CH4 conversion techniques that can efficiently and sustainably convert these increasing amounts. Furthermore, direct CH4 catalytic conversion into liquid hydrocarbons (C5+) or liquid oxygenates on-site is of major interest due to the remote location of shale gas extraction facilities and relatively high CH4 transportation costs. The world's existing fuel infrastructure is predominantly based on liquid hydrocarbons and obtaining them from CH4 is of major importance.
Common catalytic processes to activate CH4 typically follow one of the two approaches:
Direct endothermic dehydrogenation of CH4 to –CH2-containing species and H2 at high temperatures (500–1000 °C). Examples are CH4 aromatization to yield benzene and H2 over a Mo-ZSM-5 catalyst and pyrolysis to C2H4 and/or C2H2 and H2.7,8
Oxidative (and exothermic) dehydrogenation (or partial oxidation) using O2 or H2O as a cheap oxidant, as well as other less used oxidants, such as halogens or sulfur. Examples are partial oxidation of CH4 to CH3X (X = OH, Cl, Br or OSO3H), oxidative coupling to C2H6/C2H4 and partial oxidation to syngas.1,9–11
Oxidatively, CH4 is converted in refineries into the syngas intermediate to obtain usable H2via steam reforming (1) on the Ni catalyst followed by water gas shift reaction (2) CH4 + H2O ↔ CO + 3H2, ΔHo298K = 206 kJ mol−1(1) CO + H2O ↔ CO2 + H2, ΔHo298K = −41 kJ mol−1(2)which results in ~8 tons of CO2 per 1 ton of H2 generated. On the other hand, typical large scale gas-to-liquid conversion occurring via a Fischer–Tropsch or CH3OH route proceeds via slightly exothermic partial oxidation CH4 + 0.5O2 ↔ CO + 2H2, ΔHo298K = −36 kJ mol−1(3)followed by Co, Fe or Ru based coupling reactions.12 These catalytic processes generally apply fairly severe conditions to activate the otherwise stable CH4 molecule. However, the real challenge here is not the activation step or the severity of conditions required. Instead, it concerns the fact that the desired (intermediate) product is much more reactive than CH4 and is, therefore, more prone to further oxidation reactions to coke or CO2 than CH4 is prone to conversion. Acceptable selectivities are therefore only achieved at a low/moderate conversion level, which results in extensive separation and recycling of unconverted CH4. The highest yield reported so far decreased with the decreasing thermodynamic stability of the product compared to that of CH4.13 Technologies that are presently of industrial significance are based on syngas because syngas is thermodynamically favored over CH4 under the applied reaction conditions and, therefore, is produced in high yield. This also presents a major challenge in ensuring sustainable CH4 conversion to liquid fuels, where selective activation of the C–H bond with minimal conversion to CO2 is critical.5 Other oxidative approaches that apply oxidants other than O2, e.g. Cl2, H2SO4/SO3, H2O2 and superacids, have also been considered. However, in all of these, an expensive oxidant is eventually regenerated with O2 resulting in additional processing steps and byproducts.
Relatively inexpensive sources of external energy to activate CH4 are currently available directly from the sun or utilizing photovoltaic (PV) and wind generated electrons. This is due to the fact that approximately 120000 TW of solar light strikes the Earth's surface14 and only a tiny fraction of it is currently utilized, mostly as electricity.15 With the increasing solar light utilization, unprecedented energy storage challenges have recently been encountered. For example, 200000 blackouts exceeding three minutes were reported in Germany in 2011 due to the misbalance of the electrical grid resulting from the peak demand for renewable electricity.16 A way to mitigate this is by storing solar energy in the liquid hydrocarbon form.17

Fig. 1 shows the approximate locations of shale gas reserves superimposed on Global Horizontal Irradiation (GHI) maps.18,19 It can be seen that, with the exception of Northern Europe and Russia, the greatest intensity of incident light is available at the shale gas concentration areas, which could thus potentially be utilized for CH4 conversion. While current developments in utilizing excess electricity mostly focus on the Power2Gas technology of electrocatalytically converting CO2 to CH4,16 we will provide a broader perspective on how electrons can be used instead for CH4 catalytic conversion. Further, we will provide insights into the possibility of using solar photons directly for CH4 catalytic conversion, thus bypassing high capital costs incurred in photovoltaic device/electrolyzer manufacturing. Finally, we will try to conceptualize a few CH4 catalytic conversion processes that would combine both photo(electro)chemical and conventional thermal catalysis to achieve direct CH4 activation and conversion, facilitated by both electrons and temperature, bypassing reaction intermediates, such as syngas.

2. Renewable energy based CH4 activation
Electrochemistry and photochemistry can be viewed as emerging opportunities to perform sustainable CH4 conversion to fuels on-site and are, essentially, a variation of the existing conventional catalytic processes. In principle, photo(electro)chemical CH4 catalytic processes also follow one of the two main routes:
An endothermic route that uses the electrical potential to drive the dehydrogenation reaction

via direct electrochemical oxidation of CH4 to the unstable radical intermediate –CHx– + H2 followed by radical coupling to form C2H6/C2H4 or by addition of a nucleophile (e.g. solvent H2O or a dissolved additive) to form CH3OH or CH3Cl.

via indirect oxidation, e.g. photoelectrochemical oxidation of the solvent (water) or a dissolved additive (Cl−) to intermediates that can attack and oxidize CH4 to a –CHx– radical, which further reacts with the solvent or additive.
An exothermic oxidation route, e.g. using O2 as the oxidant, which liberates the heat of reaction as electrical potential (i.e. fuel cell).
It can be quickly realized that the photo(electro)chemical approach will have to face the same selectivity challenges as the more conventional catalytic routes. These selectivity challenges will therefore have to be considered carefully when analyzing the literature on photo(electro)chemical oxidation of CH4.
2.1 Electrochemical CH4 activation
The direct conversion of CH4 has been a topic of periodic interest. Over the last 50 years, electrochemical studies of CH4 activation have shown this process to be difficult and energy intensive due to the stability of the CH4 molecule, the strength of the C–H bond (439 kJ mol−1), low pKa (pKa = 48), high ionization potential (12.5 eV) and low proton affinity (4.4 eV).20–24 Despite ongoing research over several decades, the electrochemical conversion of CH4 lags in popularity behind obtaining renewable energy via water electrolysis and electrochemical carbon dioxide activation.25 The electrochemical conversion of CH4 has been extensively reported in the literature for both the electrocatalytic oxidation of CH4 at metallic anodes and the conversion of CH4 in fuel cells.26 E. J. Cairns was the first to review the electrochemical conversion of CH4 in the early 1970s27 with more recent reviews focusing on high temperature processes.28–31 The undeniable advantage of electrochemical processes, however, is their ability to drive catalytic reactions at room or low (<100 °C) temperatures and pressures and will be the main focus below. The biggest problem here is driving the catalytic process efficiently at room temperatures and pressures32–34 with inexpensive catalyst materials since most of the research has instead been limited to high temperature fuel cells (Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFC) and Molten Carbonate Fuel Cells (MCFC)).29,35–37 Though the electrochemical oxidation of CH4 is thermodynamically favored, the process is kinetically slow.23 An applied potential to a catalyst surface could potentially reduce the activation energy barrier, influence the nature of the charge-transfer reactions, and potentially stabilize the reaction intermediates on the catalyst surface, influencing which products are produced.26 Finally, the electrochemical system could be paired with inexpensive sources of external renewable electricity, such as solar (PV technology) and wind, as well as the unbalanced, excess electricity generated at night thus eliminating the need to burn fossil fuels for this conversion process.

2.1.1 High temperature electrochemical CH4 activation processes. 
High temperature processes do provide some insight into the electrochemical conversion of CH4, as an increase in temperature often results in increased reaction rates which tend to be high enough to be practical for use.30 In addition to the energy needed to use moderate to high temperatures (100–1000 °C), solid state electrolytes that consist of expensive metals or metal oxides doped with rare, expensive elements (ex. palladium, platinum, etc.) are most frequently used to electrochemically convert CH4 because they are effective at withstanding the high temperatures and also efficient at the conversion process.28,30 Other high temperature methods, such as SOFCs and electrochemical oxygen pumps (EOP), which generally use rare earth oxides and high temperatures, will not be discussed in detail here due to many current reviews.28,30,38–40 Other moderate temperature processes such as MCFCs, where the complete conversion of CH4 can be accomplished using appropriate catalysts (e.g. Ni-based catalysts),28,30 have problems with corrosion that tends to reduce cell performance and life. Intuitively, well established conventional catalytic processes, operating nearly at the same temperatures as fuel cells, will outperform the latter in stability and reliability.


2.1.2 Low temperature electrochemical CH4 activation processes. 
Low temperature processes (below 100 °C) will be the focus for the remainder of this section. Studies performed at low temperatures are ideal to reduce the amount of energy needed as an input in the conversion process, thus becoming a feasible renewable process. Low temperatures could easily be attained via heating with solar concentrators, with the necessary applied potentials generated using PV technology or wind turbines. Electrochemical cells were initially tested for CH4 activation at low temperatures and room pressure since they have the ability to modify the rates of charge transfer reactions by tuning the cell potential.30 In early studies of this process as well as in this report, it was recognized that the materials used as electrodes play a key role in the conversion process. The materials can either reduce the activation energy needed to allow the reaction to proceed or they could stabilize possible useful intermediates. The activation energy of CH4 can be related to the presence of charged species, which can initiate further CH4 activation therefore resulting in more ionically charged species.41,42 Thus the electrochemically controlled cell was developed with the idea that the formation of these species could be controlled and converted into useable products. A summary of experiments performed for the electrochemical oxidation of CH4 at low temperatures is shown in Table 1. The reaction conditions, the products produced, and the temperature range in which the experiments were run are shown. The intermediates or adsorbed species are also provided and indicated in Table 1 using parentheses. Notably, the majority of these experiments were performed using aqueous electrolytic cells. As can be seen from Table 1, most of the electrodes used are rare metals, such as Pt or Pd, which eventually produce CO2 when CH4 is oxidized and generally require a specific electrolyte, such as a strong acid or base. Platinum is widely used due to its high electrocatalytic activity; however, this comes at an expensive price of a limited resource and is unattractive to use on a wide distribution basis.

Furthermore, the data in Table 1 for electrochemical CH4 activation point to CO2 and H2O as the major species produced by the electrochemical activation, with a few exceptions, rather than useful liquid hydrocarbons, though the quantities depend on the conditions at which the activation is performed. This has been theorized to be due to weak and slow chemisorption of CH4 on the metal electrode surfaces becoming the rate-limiting step26 and indiscriminate solution generated radical induced bond breaking. Additionally, since the electrochemical activation at low temperatures generally produced complete conversion to CO2 no selectivities or conversion rates were provided.
Surface studies using molecular beam experiments showed that the sticking coefficient of CH4 is very low and is little influenced by temperature.64,65 Recent theoretical studies have shown that CH4 dissociates on the metal surface to form CH3, CH2, and CH66–68 with –CH– being the most abundant species present when exposed to Pt(100)68 and Pt(111) surfaces.67 Chen and Vlachos arrived at a similar mechanism on Pt(111) and Pt(211) surfaces and found that coordination sites, such as steps, are crucial in lowering barriers for dehydrogenation and oxidation.69 Other metals, such as Co, Rh, Ru, Pd, Ir or Ni, have also been studied theoretically, though to the authors' knowledge these have not been experimentally investigated at lower temperatures.66,67,70–101 These results have provided some insight into the possible mechanism for activation of CH4 on different metal surfaces. For example the dissociation of CH4 on Ni has been shown to occur via hollow or bridge sites where Pt appears on the top or edge sites.66,68 Zhang and co-workers showed in a systematic study of the Pt surfaces (i.e. Pt(111), Pt(110) & Pt(100)) that the catalyst can resist carbon deposition providing insight into why Pt has shown high activity for CH4 activation.68 In terms of the theoretical examination of the electrooxidation of CH4, Psofogiannakis and co-workers showed that the dehydrogenation reactions of CH4 were followed by the oxygenation reactions of the adsorbed CHx species. This study also suggested that the CH4 chemisorption step is the rate-limiting step in the oxidation of CH4.67
Bagotzky et al. proposed a generalized chain of the possible steps that are involved in the electrooxidation of CH4 and other C1 organics.102 This network is shown in Fig. 2 for CH4. Other potential pathways to molecules such as methanol and formic acid have been removed due to experimental observations (shown in Table 1) of complete conversion of CH4 to carbon dioxide on Pt surfaces.67
 Fig. 2  The Bagotzky mechanism for the electrooxidation of CH4.67,102 
While Pt has been widely used to study CH4 electrochemical activation in the past, experimentally the partial electrooxidation methods were originally proposed by Frese using gold, glassy carbon, copper and mercury electrodes that were exposed to CH4 at room temperature.32 The electrodes were chosen for various reasons, which include their oxygen reduction capabilities to form peroxides, O2H− and O2− , at low overpotentials (carbon, Hg, and Au) and effectiveness at oxidizing CH4via O2 at the solid/gas interface (Cu).32 The electrolytes varied from 0.01 to 2 M KOH, 0.1 M NaClO4 and 2 M NaOH, with the electrode potentials ranging from +0.8 to +0.4 V vs. the dynamic hydrogen electrode (DHE). The products observed by thermal conductivity gas chromatography included CH2O, CH3OH, CO and CO2 where, despite the varied conditions (e.g. electrode, electrolyte, stirring rate, etc.), the dominant product formed was CH2O; CO and CO2 were observed in minor quantities. A relevant finding from this study was the rates of the low temperature processes (10−5 to 10−9 mol cm−2 h−1) of CH4 reacting at low temperatures to form C1 molecules, which Frese attributed to the increased lifetime of the intermediate species, possibly generated electrochemically by using a high pH solution.32
More recently, the electro-oxidation of CH4 under low temperature conditions has been reported on Pd33 and Pt/Ru alloys.103 Hahn and Melendres used in situ infrared spectroscopy to monitor the electro-oxidation of CH4 on Pd electrodes at room temperature in perchloric acid.33 Their studies showed that –CO, –CHO, and –COOH were the intermediate species with the final oxidation product always being CO2, regardless of the electrode material. The intermediate species produced suggest that there is some involvement of H2O or OHads in the reaction mechanism. Platinum and ruthenium appeared to be the most active of the electrodes. Zhang et al. proposed that using a roughened or smooth Pd electrode could produce CO2via 8-electron anodic oxidation of CH4 under ambient conditions.20 These studies were carried out using cyclic voltammetry between 0.0 to +1.5 V, multiple scan rates, and under varying CH4 concentrations.20 Based on the previous studies33,67,104,105 and their own, they proposed electro-oxidation to be a multi-step process (the asterisk denotes adsorbed species): CH4 → CH*3(ads) + H+ + 1e−(4) CH*3(ads) + H2O → CO*(ads) + 5H+ + 5e−(5) CO*(ads) + H2O → CO2 + 2H+ + 2e−(6)Overall anodic oxidation is then equal to CH4 + 2H2O → CO2 + 8H+ + 8e−(7)
This shows that CH4 dissociates at the electrode surface to a CHx species, which is then covered with CO through a series of surface reactions that eventually leads to the formation of CO2. Their multi-step process is similar to that reported by the other studies, where CO2 and H+ are the final products in the electro-oxidation. Additionally, they reported high electrocatalytic activity of the roughened electrode, as opposed to smooth Pd, which can possibly be attributed to a larger surface to volume ratio.20 Recently, Wang and Zeng approached the activation of CH4 using ionic liquids (ILs), which are organic electrolytes that contain charge-diffuse cations and anions with minimal vapor pressure and are stable under various experimental conditions.23 ILs potentially increase solubility of CH4 and provide a strong polar environment, presumably facilitating CH4 activation electrostatically. Using bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (NTf2) based ILs, a Pt gauze working electrode pressed into a porous Teflon membrane and polycrystalline Pt wires as the counter and quasi-reference electrodes, the electro-oxidation of CH4 was attempted. Experiments were performed at 25 °C in acidified electrolyte and the potentials scanned were from 1.5 V to −1.8 V.23 Other working electrodes, such as gold and carbon, were also used to determine if CH4 could be oxidized. Overall, CH4 was fully oxidized to H2O and CO2 using NTf2 based ILs at room temperature, but the results appeared to be dependent on the conditions under which the experiment is run (i.e. oxygen concentration, the potential of the electrode, and properties of the IL). Wang and Zeng proposed that adsorbed oxygen atoms on vacant Pt sites react with the ILs to form the stable complex Pt–O + NTf2− ↔ O–Pt–NTf2− ↔ O–Pt–NTf*2 + e(8)which then reacts with CH4 4O–Pt–NTf*2 + CH4 ↔ CO2 + 2H2O + 4Pt–NTf*2(9)so that the overall reaction proceeds as (10)
From the data discussed so far, it quickly becomes apparent that very few direct electrochemical oxidation processes lead to oxygenate intermediates that can be stabilized and isolated as liquid fuel or commodity chemical products. Mechanistic studies lead to the belief that the adsorbed species undergo further oxidation with fewer electrons than the number needed to activate CH4 in the first place. Conventional catalytic processes proceed heterogeneously via gas–solid surface interactions and thus kinetics can be controlled rather easily by optimizing contact time; however, this is much more difficult to accomplish when using aqueous solutions. Furthermore, this process is further complicated by the presence of various indiscriminate radical species in solution, which nonselectively oxidize any carbon containing molecules formed.
This problem is partially remedied when an indirect electrochemical CH4 oxidation process is used. Ogura and Takamagari combined electrochemistry and photochemical oxidation of CH4 using a 0.6 M KCl solution as an electrolyte to produce CH3OH, CH3Cl, and CH2Cl2.49 The formation of the products greatly depended on the cell potential, which varied from 1.1 to 2.0 V at pH 11.0. In this seminal, yet underfollowed study, the combination of the two energy input methods produced a chlorine molecule, which then formed a radical; upon illumination, it further reacted with CH4 to form photochemically chlorinated CH4 or chloromethane (CH3Cl), which in all cases appeared to be the dominant product. Methanol (CH3OH) and dichloromethane (CH3Cl2) tended to be the next most common species present. The mechanism for the production of CH4 was proposed via two methods. The first method involved the formation of a MOH species, where M is the electrode, which then proceeded to react with a methyl radical to produce methanol. The second method involved the hydrolysis of CH3Cl to produce methanol and chloride ions. Both methods are thought to occur due to the observation of methanol production even at low pH (pH ~1). These studies were further refined by Ogura, et al.47,48 Their investigation showed that using Pt working and counter electrodes at 1.3 V vs. the SHE produced CH3OH, CH3Cl, and CH2Cl2 in aqueous electrolyte at pH = 11.0 when illuminated for 3 hours with a 10 W Hg lamp at 25 °C. The major product observed was CH3Cl, followed by either CH2Cl2 or CH3OH, with a negligible amount of carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) reported. The formation of CH2Cl2 and CH3OH was determined to be dependent on the concentration of the chloride ion present in the electrolyte. The authors proposed that upon the photodissociation of Cl2 at 350 nm, CH4 can be converted to methyl chloride and methanol by electrochemical oxidation under illumination. The formation of methanol was proposed to be due to the hydrolysis of CH3Cl, which was enhanced electrochemically. Ogura et al. then examined the photochemical activation of CH4 in the presence of water which produced methanol as the dominant product (~70% at 90 °C) followed by formic acid (11%), ethanol (5%), formaldehyde (5%), acetone (4%) and acetic acid (3%). This was attributed to the hydroxyl radical formation from the photolysis of water at temperatures lower than 100 °C.48 Clearly, the work demonstrated by Ogura et al. showed a powerful proof of concept of indirect CH4 activation to liquid oxygenates at atmospheric pressure and temperature. It relied, however, on the inherent reactivity of ions in halide aqueous solutions, thus circumventing indiscriminate electron/reactive radical based complete CH4 oxidation.

2.2. Photochemical CH4 activation
Photochemical processes involve a semiconductor material excited with light to generate charge carrier pairs, e.g. electrons and holes. By analogy with the electrochemical process, these electrons can be used in reduction reactions as a substitute for thermal energy, whereas holes in the conduction band can perform oxidation. The resulting charge carriers possess kinetic energy equal to that of the bandgap of the semiconductor material and could possibly drive thermodynamically unfavorable (ΔG > 0) CH4 activation reactions. A simplistic view of this process is shown in Fig. 3 where the solar spectrum is shown with the specific CH4 activation reactions of interest, converted to energy of one mole of photons. It quickly becomes apparent that, for example, theoretically CH3OH formation can be driven on a photocatalyst using a semiconductor material with a bandgap of ~1000 nm (~1.3 eV). Practically, however, this will always be preceded by C–H bond breaking which requires much more energy (434 kJ mol−1 or 275 nm). It is expected that suitable photocatalysts in combination with a molecule reforming co-catalyst could drive these thermodynamically unfavorable reactions106 resulting in the formation of storable energy dense chemicals or a storable form of solar energy.

A tutorial style review of photocatalytic CH4 activation was published in 2008.107 We will focus on the new developments in the methods and photocatalyst materials as well as the possible applied aspects of photocatalytic CH4 activation.

2.2.1. Photocatalytic steam (aqueous) reforming. 
An emerging CH4 activation method that utilizes the photocatalytic phenomenon – photocatalytic steam reforming of CH4108–110 – proceeds according to reaction (11) CH4 + 2H2O → 4H2 + CO2, ΔG(298 K) = 114 kJ mol−1(11)
While this can be regarded as a combination of steam (although photocatalytically performed in aqueous medium, the steam reforming name is historically used) methane reforming and water gas shift reactions, the resulting H2 is even more difficult to pressurize/liquefy than CH4 and problematic to use as liquid fuel. Previous work in this area has mostly originated from Nagoya University and focused on noble metal cocatalyzed wide bandgap insulator systems, such as Pt/TiO2,111 Pt/CaTiO3,112 Pt/NaTaO3:La,108 Rh2O3/K2Ti6O13,110 Pt/β-Ga2O3,113 and Pt,Rh,Au,Pd,Ni/β-Ga2O3.114 Wide bandgap catalysts such as TiO2 and β-Ga2O3 are well known in photocatalytic water splitting, although they require UV light. This results in stringent criteria for the overall process efficiency, if the visible spectrum is used. One of the first processes was carried out at room temperature and room pressure with an almost stoichiometric product mixture (4:1) on Pt/TiO2.111 Additionally, various catalyst structures and composition parameters were explored for Pt/CaTiO3,112 while substitutional doping of the photocatalyst material Pt/NaTaO3:La108 and the co-catalyst effect on Pt,Rh,Au,Pd,Ni/β-Ga2O3114 were also explored. Noble metal catalysts have been shown to be necessary to improve generated charge carrier separation and to catalyze H2 evolution and seem to be necessary for aqueous photocatalytic CH4 reforming. However, Ni loaded onto β-Ga2O3 particles using in situ photodeposition showed reasonable H2 production rates, comparable to those of the Pd or Au co-catalyst, while co-deposited Rh showed the best overall performance (0.4 μmol min−1).114 Nickel is a well-known CH4 steam reforming catalyst, thus active in C–H bond breaking, and it has also recently been shown to be efficient as a non-noble hydrogen evolution catalyst in complexes such as nickel nitrides and phosphides, with the Ni2P (001) surface being catalytically active.115,116 Various nickel phosphides with crystalline phases have been shown to possess photocatalytic properties in oxidizing various organic compounds117,118 and can be proposed to be used to improve photocatalytic steam reforming efficiency. Finally, small ions (Al3+, Mg2+, In3+, and Zn2+) doped into the β-Ga2O3 structure increased H2 evolution activity,114 which could possibly be due to improved photocatalytically generated charge carrier separation. While liquid fuels are not produced using this method, of great interest would be experiments where syngas is produced, rather than a H2 + CO2 mixture. However, to date the authors are unaware of any data reported on these attempts.


2.2.2. Partial photochemical CH4 oxidation to methanol. 
Direct photocatalytic oxidation to CH3OH viareaction (12) has been of perennial interest due to CH3OH serving as an intermediate of a wide range of chemicals while a byproduct, H2, is an energy carrier CH4 + H2O → CH3OH + 4H2, ΔG(298 K) = 117 kJ mol−1(12)
Initial attempts at oxidation have been made at the United States Department of Energy National Energy Technology Laboratory (DOE NETL) using CH4119,120 and methane hydrate121 to produce CH3OH using doped TiO2 and WO3 photocatalyst aqueous chemistry. Typical CH4 conversion was ~4% on La/WO3,120 with 1.7 g of CH3OH g−1 of the catalyst h−1 produced.122 Other products, in addition to those in reaction (12), were H2, CO, and O2,120,122 proposed to be formed via H2O photochemical splitting and the resulting radical chemistry. Co-catalysts other than La, such as Pt and Cu, resulted in equal or lower CH3OH production than La. Experiments were performed at 95 °C and no CH3OH was observed at temperatures <70 °C, implying that there is a thermal barrier. Simulated methane hydrate photocatalytic activation on both La/WO3 and TiO2 resulted in other products, such as C2H6, HCOOH and CO2.121 The difference from previous experiments was the use of high pressure (10 MPa) to induce the formation of hydrates at 268 K before the reaction.121 Since the latter experiment was performed in a batch mode for 1 h, these products, including CO2, can be proposed to be kinetically controlled, as is typical in partial CH4 oxidation reactions. The use of a high intensity coherent laser source in combination with TiO2, WO3 and NiO photocatalysts was explored to intensify the CH3OH production process.123,124 The laser wavelength used was greater than the bandgap of the corresponding material to ensure the photocatalytic phenomenon. The interplay between the photocatalyst loading (~0.07 g L−1) and the laser power (1.5 W) always resulted in a maximum on the CH3OH concentration curve, defining the optimal photocatalytic conditions.123
Mechanistically, several free radical based transformations occur with a hydroxyl radical proposed as a key intermediate121,122,124 SC + hν → SC (hVB+, eCB−)(13) H2O + hVB+ → H˙ + OH˙(14) CH4 + OH˙ → CH3OH + H˙(15) H˙ + H˙ → H2.(16)
However, CH3OH produced can further react with holes or a superoxide radical produced either from dissolved O2 or that generated via photocatalytic H2O splitting, yielding HCOOH, CO and CO2. This presents a selectivity challenge, as O2 evolution from H2O must be inhibited for the process to be CO2 neutral. This presents an opportunity to use ionic liquids that dissolve CH4 at rates higher than H2O, which is also a prerequisite for any photoelectrochemical process. Conventional catalysis has been successfully attempted to directly convert CH4 to CH3OH in ionic liquids on Pt based catalysts125–127 providing the lead here.


2.2.3. Non-oxidative photocatalytic CH4 coupling. 
Direct photocatalytic CH4 coupling to yield ethane proceeds via 2CH4 → C2H6 + H2, ΔG(298 K) = 68.6 kJ mol−1.(17)
Many photocatalyst materials explored thus far are largely based on transition metal substituted silica framework materials, as will be discussed below.
2.2.3.1. Wide bandgap photocatalysts. 
Wide bandgap photocatalysts have been extensively used for this purpose so far, even though they absorb only a fraction of the incident solar radiation spectrum. Room temperature experiments on ethane and H2 production were performed using a silica matrix with incorporated noble metal ions via Si–O–M linkage, where M is Zn,128 Ce,129 Ti,130 Ga,131 Al,132 Zr,133 and Mg.133 Ce was shown to be the only active metal ion with a detectable efficiency out of the 14 tested rare earth dopants incorporated into the silica matrix.129 Interesting synergistic effects within ternary compounds, such as SiO2–Al2O3–TiO2, have been observed130 with the increase in C2H6 and even the C3H8 product yield over those of the binary compounds. A CH4 conversion rate of 9.8 μmol g−1 of the catalyst h−1 was reported for Zn doped ZSM-5 irradiated with a high pressure Hg lamp with selectivity greater than 99% for ethane and hydrogen products.128 Incorporation of other metals, such as Ga, Al, Zn and Fe into ETS-10 (e.g. a microporous titanosilicate framework) resulted in an enhanced CH4 conversion rate of 29.8 μmol g−1 of the catalyst h−1 for the best performing Ga dopant.131 Remarkably high selectivities towards ethane and hydrogen were observed in photocatalytic experiments using ZSM-5 as a host (99%)128 allowing the use of the shape selectivity argument in the framework of photocatalytic CH4 coupling.
Any CH4 activation has to proceed via initial C–H bond breaking and any photocatalytic mechanisms or catalysts that facilitate this can be proposed to enhance the conversion rate. High activity of certain metal oxides in H/D exchange and C–H bond dissociation experiments has been classified for Cr2O3, Ga2O3 and ZnO, with MgO and some rare earth metal oxides showing moderate activity.134 MgO dispersed within SiO2 has been shown to yield ~0.03% hydrocarbons due to the Si–O–Mg linkage sites.135 While not explicitly mentioned, MgO could have synergistically acted as a C–H bond dissociation cocatalyst, as confirmed by high efficiencies of Mg, Ga and Zn doped silica materials.128,131 An additional photocatalytic reaction parameter that could impact the activity of CH4 is increasing the temperature, which has been shown to double the amount of C2H6 and H2 produced on β-Ga2O3 with an increase in temperature from 314 to 473 K.107 This was suggested to be due to the enhanced desorption of reaction intermediates and products or the enhanced migration of photoexcited electrons. There was, however, a non-stoichiometric amount of products generated with excess H2 pointing towards several competing reactions proceeding at different rates at elevated temperatures. Notably, we could not find any mention of the formation of a COx product using photocatalytic coupling reactions133 on any of these metal oxide photocatalyst surfaces suggesting that the process is potentially CO2 neutral and most likely proceeds via Si–O˙ radical and charge transfer induced photochemistry135 and is not a Mars–van Krevelen type of reaction.
A special case of CH4 activation using a combination of deep UV (180–200 nm) and solid surfaces containing hydroxyl groups was performed by Corma and García's group.136,137 C1 oxygenates were obtained with CH4 conversion of up to 7% via indirect hydroxyl radical based C–H bond breaking. H2 accounted for ~50% of the products with C2H5OH accounting for ~26% using a beta zeolite after 11 hours of irradiation at room temperature. When O2 was present as a co-reactant, the oxygenated product selectivity was 95%. Analogously, a theoretical study on CH4 activation on the external radical generating reactant, H2S, has been shown to yield reactive HS˙ and H˙ radicals in the presence of 200 nm light to reform CH4 into CH3SH, an activated CH4 intermediate.138 The latter process, albeit only theoretically investigated, allows for the conversion of the so-called “sour” natural gas which accounts for ~40% of the available conventional resources. These types of processes again are heavily reliant on in situ radical generation and can be envisioned to take place in UV lamp equipped reactors where surplus electricity is present.
2.2.3.2. Visible bandgap photocatalysts. 
An intuitive approach to photocatalytic transformations suggests that better solar utilization efficiency can be achieved if photocatalyst materials can absorb visible light, thus utilizing most of the incident spectrum. Data reported by Li et al. on CH4 photocatalytic coupling using Zn+-SiO2128 yielded 24% CH4 conversion upon irradiation of the catalyst for 8 hours using a high-pressure mercury lamp. Furthermore, this photocatalyst has been shown to be active upon irradiation with visible light, although the reaction rate decreased and conversion stopped after 8 hours. The electron transfer process, as inferred from Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, must proceed initially from the zeolitic framework to the 4s orbital of Zn2+ upon UV irradiation at wavelengths less than 390 nm while visible light (~700 nm) is utilized to cocatalyze the Zn 4s electron to the C–H σ* antibonding orbital of CH4, thus activating CH4 to form C2H6 and H2 (Fig. 4).128 Due to the UV energy utilized in the first step, the zeolitic materials will possess low visible light efficiency. An attractive concept here would be visible light-absorbing materials, possessing unsaturated oxygen atoms that could act as radical centers. While small clusters of similar materials have only been observed in the gas phase and are not yet applicable in applied heterogeneous catalysis, the oxygen-centered radical concept for CH4 activation can provide the necessary leads.139 The spin density localized on oxygen atoms is capable of a nearly barrier-free gas phase CH4–hydrogen atom transfer and the mechanisms have been investigated extensively using DFT in a multitude of transition metal clusters.139–141 By analogy, polyoxometalates (POMs) possess terminal oxygen atoms which are active sites for photocatalytic oxidation reactions142via oxygen localized radicals.143 They have already been shown to be active in thermal CH4 activation.144 Furthermore, ample POMs have currently been synthesized that absorb visible light and possess terminal oxygen groups which can act as radical carriers upon photoexcitation,145 thus potentially serving as visible light operated CH4 activation catalysts.
 Fig. 4  CH4 activation on Zn+-SiO2 using visible light, adapted from Li et al.128 
Lastly, chlorine radical mediated photocatalytic C–H bond activation on a TiO2/BiOBr photocatalyst has been shown to proceed under visible light (420 < λ < 780 nm) irradiation in the presence of 1 atm oxygen at room temperature with remarkable selectivities (>85%).146 Chlorine radicals formed on a photocatalyst surface, due to excess co-adsorbed oxygen and CH4, do not form alkyl halides but rather oxygenated compounds. This is akin to homogenous phase halogen based CH4 activation reactions that suffer from poor selectivity due to the higher number of degrees of freedom of the chlorine radicals generated. This process potentially offers a new photocatalytic route for C–H bond activation at room temperature utilizing visible light as the sole energy source. The high selectivity reported implies a CO2 neutral process as no byproducts, other than minor HCl and O2, have been reported.146


2.2.3. Dry (carbon dioxide) photocatalytic reforming of CH4. 
Dry (carbon dioxide) photocatalytic reforming of CH4 proceeds via CH4 + CO2 → 2CO + 2H2, ΔG(298 K) = 171 kJ mol−1(18)
Wide bandgap semiconductors have been used to overcome the large activation barrier photochemically using β-Ga2O3,107 Cu/CdS–TiO2/SiO2,147 ZrO2,148,149 ZnO,150 TiO2151 and copper phthalocyanine modified TiO2152 on a stainless steel mesh, as well as on MgO.153 A more interesting alternative is the potential of direct C–C coupling of CH4 and CO2 to acetic acid (CH3COOH (ΔG(298 K) = 71.1 kJ mol−1)), acetone (CH3COCH3 (ΔG(298 K) = 115 kJ mol−1)) or other related compounds. Photocatalytic reforming data are summarized in Table 2.

It can be seen that the catalyst used as well as the temperature of the photocatalytic reaction affected the product selectivity. Cu/CdS–TiO2/SiO2 was shown to be selective towards CH3COCH3 formation at 393 K, whereas β-Ga2O3 yielded primarily C2H6. Additional products that were observed but not quantified were oxalic acid, acetaldehyde, acetic acid, water, and CO,152 although in this particular case it's not clear whether copper phthalocyanine itself didn't decompose. A thermal effect was apparent and can also be seen from the data presented in Table 2. CH4 and CO2 conversion increased with temperature, but at higher temperatures a noticeable amount of CO and excess H2 were observed, possibly suggesting that reforming reactions become more favorable over coupling. Low temperatures favored high selectivity of 83% towards C2H6.107 Only in one case was the gas hourly space volume (GHSV) reported to be 200 h−1 whereas other batch experiments were carried out for 1–8 hours. Finally, the process and the catalyst for CH4 + CO2 photochemical reforming on non-metal oxides – transition metal chalcogenide photocatalysts – in a recent patent application154 were claimed, including an example of RuS2 in a UV light reactor with a CH4:CO2 (50%:50%) stream, to produce an unspecified mixture of paraffins, olefins and alcohols. Conceptually, certain transition metal sulfides (CoS, RuS2, NiS, MoS2 and WS2) have a bandgap of 1.1 to 1.8 eV (1130 to 690 nm) thus absorbing visible radiation138 but the reaction mechanism is not immediately clear.

3. Limitations and future applications of renewable energy based CH4 conversion
Electrons and holes needed to perform CH4 conversion can be delivered directly with solar light or in the form of electricity. Electrochemistry can lead to much faster conversion rates, and hence more intense processes, especially since at low temperatures it can borrow fundamental and applied knowledge from the well-established water electrolysis technology. A clear advantage of the electrochemical process, when compared with the conventional heterogeneous catalysts, is that in most cases no catalyst preparation is necessary, unlike CH4 steam reformers, where catalyst reduction must proceed initially. Additionally, the electrochemical process can be used in combination with the current PV or wind technology to limit the use of fossil fuels used during the CH4 activation. Effectively, this allows for electrochemical CH4 activation to start almost instantaneously whenever excess electricity is present. This can be considered advantageous compared to small scale CH4 steam reforming where the startup time still needs to be improved.155 The data reviewed, however, present very few opportunities for electrochemical CH4 activation at low temperatures due to the low selectivity and slow rate of the process. A notable exception is based on aqueous halide solution electrochemistry to generate methanol and methyl halides.49 This can be viewed as a low temperature alternative to the recent efforts devoted to halogen based CH4 conversion to liquid fuels.1,156,157
A summary of the photocatalytic CH4 activation is shown in Fig. 5. As typical for solar energy utilization, the achievable rate is limited by the photon flux of the sun. This in turn requires expansion of the photoreactor area. Naturally, the process cannot be continuous throughout the day because of limited illumination time in a day and its lack thereof at night. Furthermore, the somewhat low efficiency of charge separation of the photocatalytic process coincides with the difficult adsorption process of the reactant (CH4), which is essential for the activation reaction. Most of the reported photocatalysts are strongly limited by the UV-responsive materials. Thermodynamic requirements (band positions) for the photocatalysts are additional requirements to ensure that the desired reactions proceed. Somewhat unexpectedly, photocatalysis provides for a much better selectivity to the products. These processes could potentially proceed at room temperature, where, for example, CH4 coupling reactions are thermodynamically favored;138 the energy supplied from photons is also used to overcome C–H bond activation, normally an endothermic process, while high temperatures provide thermodynamic stability for solid carbon formation158 and the resulting loss of catalyst activity.
 Fig. 5  The photocatalytic process, catalyst and co-catalyst materials and observed products in the photocatalytic CH4 activation. 
However, the overall process efficiency remains an issue for the photochemical processes. From the literature reviewed, a GHSV of only 200 h−1 was achieved147 with the rest of the experiments run in a batch mode. This is unlike the catalytic oxidative CH4 coupling where the GHSV is orders of magnitude higher (8000–17000 h−1).159 Nevertheless, photochemical CH4 activation provides excellent opportunities in combining light and temperature effects at the same time since it can also be performed in the gas phase as well as in solution. Finally, conceptually new combined catalytic processes can be envisioned. For example, dry conventional CH4 reforming results in a nonstoichiometric syngas mixture on Ni, Ru, Rh/Al2O3 or SiO2160 which can be later used to produce C1–C5 hydrocarbons via the Fischer–Tropsch process (Fig. 6). A class of alkali cocatalyzed molybdenum, nickel or cobalt sulfide catalysts has emerged to produce higher alcohols from syngas.161–163 Metal sulfides are well-known photocatalysts and recently have become widely utilized in photochemical H2 evolution from H2O.164 Conceptually, the photochemical effect can be envisioned to combine both syngas production and the resulting alcohol forming reactions on metal sulfide photocatalysts, in agreement with the recently filed patent.154

4. Conclusions
Based on the analyses provided above, we have identified the key opportunities & technical challenges that photoelectrochemical approaches present vs. conventional thermochemical routes. The idea to use photoelectrochemisty for CH4 processing into liquid fuels is synergistically driven: both CH4 and electricity are difficult to store or transport. Using the combination of photons and electricity may tell us whether or not these processes have a chance to compete for large scale applications, for fuel or rather chemicals, or whether we should seek opportunities in smaller scale, niche applications.
