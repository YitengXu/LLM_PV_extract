    , Accepted 14th March 2023First published on 15th March 2023AbstractDeep-red emitting phosphors at 650–700 nm are highly required for chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b in the photosynthesis process to promote plant growth. Here, single-phased Sr4Al14O25 (SAO):x%Eu2+,y%Mn4+ (0.02 ≤ x ≤ 0.12, 0.04 ≤ y ≤ 4) phosphors with high energy transfer efficiency were synthesized through a novel two-step high-temperature solid-state method. The divalent valences of Eu ions and tetravalent valences of Mn ions were confirmed using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy. Under 360 nm excitation, the phosphors exhibit a broad green light emission band and a strong sharp deep-red emission ranging from 630 nm to 700 nm. The decay lifetimes of Eu2+ monitored at 492 nm decline from 5.26 μs to 0.98 μs with adjusting the concentration of Mn4+. Energy transfer from Eu2+ to Mn4+ in the host was demonstrated to be a dipole–dipole interaction with up to 81.3% efficiency. Both the fabricated sunlight-converting films and a light-emitting diode prepared using the Sr4Al14O25:Eu2+,Mn4+ phosphor indicated that they have high potential for promoting plant growth.
Introduction
Extreme weather-related events such as droughts, locust swarms, and torrential rains have become more common in recent years as a result of global warming.1 Furthermore, due to factors such as reduced arable land, soil pollution, and water scarcity, the traditional agricultural ecological environment has become harsh; crop yields are declining, making it impossible to meet human needs. In this context, a new type of indoor plant factory has increasingly emerged, whose features advance modern agricultural technology to achieve sustainable development while increasing production and income in plant growth.2
Plant growth is inseparable from the five elements of light, temperature, water, air and fertilizer, the most important of which is light,3 because light is not only a primary source of energy, but also plays an important role in photosynthesis. During the photosynthesis process, plant pigments facilitate the conversion of light energy into chemical energy. The pigments are primarily composed of four important plant pigments, namely chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, red light phytochrome (Pr) and far-red light phytochrome (Pfr). Blue (400–500 nm), red (600–700 nm), and far-infrared light (700–780 nm) are mainly absorbed by these pigments.4
The spectrum of the light source can be adjusted to control the organic matter distribution, morphology, and yield of plants, thereby shortening the crop growth cycle and increasing yield. Moreover, an optimal light environment can inhibit germ reproduction. The most effective light conditions for the growth of many plants have also been shown in the literature to be deep-red light with a small amount of blue light (roughly a 3–5:1 ratio).5
To provide the plants with light, high-pressure sodium lamps, metal halide lamps, and fluorescent lamps, among others, have been successively used as indoor light sources for plant factories.6 Traditional indoor light sources, on the other hand, have drawbacks such as energy waste, short lifespan, and a low proportion of red and blue light. Red phosphor-converted light-emitting diodes (pc-LEDs) have emerged as a research hotspot among many schemes due to their high brightness, high efficiency and long lifespan. This method involves encapsulating phosphors on near-ultraviolet or blue-light LED chips and exciting the phosphors to emit the light required by plants, such as red and blue light. However, the necessary electrical equipment, as well as the investment and maintenance costs, is prohibitively expensive for plant factories.
The most exciting prospect, which is based on the concept of light-converting agents and light-converting films proposed by former Soviet scientists Golodkova and others in 1983, is the preparation of thin films with rare earth fluorescent compounds and resins (PVC, PE, PMMA, etc.), improving the light transmission quality of the prepared film and thus promoting photosynthesis.7,8 Y2O3:Eu3+ and CaS:Cu+ systems have been reported to convert ultraviolet light into red and blue light fractions, and the CaS:Eu2+ system converts a fraction of green light into red light.9 There also have been reports of the use of a novel composite light-converting agro-textile containing a photoluminescent composition on lettuces, with the results demonstrating that the quality and yield of the biomass are significantly higher than those with traditional agricultural films.10
Many red phosphors have been studied, such as CaAlSiN3:Eu2+,11 Ba2Tb(BO3)2Cl:Eu,12 LaSc3(BO3)4:Eu3+,13 BaMgPO7:Eu2+-Mn2+,14 and BaZnOS:Mn2+;15 however, their emission spectra and the absorption spectra of chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b do not really match. Therefore, it is necessary to select a suitable red phosphor. Among red-emitting phosphors, Eu2+, Eu3+, Mn2+, and Mn4+ are the main luminescent centers.16 However, Eu2+-doped red phosphors are less reported, because the absorption region of Eu2+ is in the UV and it requires a large Stokes shift to emit red light. The quantum efficiency of Eu3+ is not very high since the absorption is weak due to the forbidden transition (f–f), and the emission spectrum features sharp lines. Mn2+ absorbs very little ultraviolet and visible light, such as in the case of NaCaPO4:Mn2+,17,18 resulting in low luminous intensity, which is not ideal for plant growth. The emission of Mn4+ is attributed to the 2E → 4A2 transition, which is less affected by the crystal field and has an emission range that matches the absorption spectra of chlorophyll, making it a suitable luminescent center. Its luminescence intensity, however, is low due to its forbidden transition. As a result, the energy transfer method was adopted to improve its luminescence performance.19,20 The Eu2+ ion is introduced as the sensitizer ion in order to increase the emission intensity of the activator Mn4+ ion. Furthermore, Eu2+ can additionally provide some of the blue light component required for plant growth.
As for the host, many Mn-doped red phosphors, such as K2TiF6:Mn4+ and K2SiF6:Mn4+,21,22 endanger the ecosystem due to their raw materials containing hydrogen fluoride (HF). Thus, Mn4+-doped oxides can be candidates. In addition, aluminates have the advantage of being thermally stable and non-toxic.23 Since the ionic radii of Eu and Sr are relatively similar, the ionic radii of Mn and Al are similar, and the Mn4+-doped Al-containing oxide is environmentally friendly and stable, the oxide Sr4Al14O25 (SAO) is chosen as the matrix.
Moreover, the preparation of Eu2+ must be done in a reducing atmosphere, while the preparation of Mn4+ must be carried out in an air atmosphere. Eu2+ and Eu3+ ions coexist in traditional air sintering processes, and the ratio is difficult to control.24,25 The Eu3+ content is too high, resulting in insufficient energy transfer and weak emission intensity of the Mn4+ ions.26 Herein, a two-step high-temperature solid-state method (two-step method) for preparing Eu2+–Mn4+ co-doped samples is detailed.
In this study, Sr4Al14O25 (SAO) was used as the host and a series of Mn4+ singly doped SAO:Mn4+ and Eu2+–Mn4+ co-doped SAO:Eu2+–Mn4+ (Eu–Mn) materials were fabricated under different atmospheres via the two-step method, and the crystal structure, optical performance, decay lifetime and energy transfer efficiency were thoroughly analyzed in detail. Furthermore, a sunlight-converting film and LED were successfully manufactured based on these phosphors.
Materials and methods
Materials and synthesis
Eu2+-doped, Mn4+-doped, and Eu2+–Mn4+-codoped Sr4Al14O25 (SAO) phosphors were synthesized through traditional solid-state reaction under different conditions. SrCO3 (Macklin, analytical reagent (A.R.)), Al(OH)3 (Macklin, A.R.), Eu2O3 (Macklin, 99.999%) and MnO2 (Macklin, 99.99%.) were weighed out according to the stoichiometric ratio, and 6 wt% H3BO3 (Macklin, A.R.) was added as a flux. These raw materials were added to an agate mortar, and the mixture was ground homogeneously with ethanol for 40 min. The obtained mixture was then transferred to alumina crucibles, which were then placed into a tube in a furnace and calcined at 1260 °C for 6 h in air, or in an atmosphere of N2–H2, to synthesize Mn4+-doped samples and Eu2+-doped samples, respectively. The samples were cooled to 500 °C at a rate of 5 °C min−1, decreased to room temperature with natural cooling and ground into a powder for further analysis. To obtain Eu2+,Mn4+-co-doped phosphors, the above two powders were mixed evenly with ethanol as well as 6 wt% H3BO3 and placed into crucibles. The crucibles were then sintered at 1200 °C in an atmosphere of N2 for 6 h. This is denoted as the two-step method. Other experimental conditions were the same as previously used. In this study, all the SAO:Eu2+–Mn4+ samples mentioned were prepared using the two-step method, with exceptions noted.
The co-doped phosphor Sr4Al14O25:0.1%Eu2+,0.4%Mn4+ was combined with PDMS in a 1:4 ratio. After stirring for 90 s in a vacuum degasser, the mixture was coated evenly on a 30 × 30 × 0.15 cm3 transparent glass plate, and then placed in an oven for 10 h at 80 °C. Finally, the plate was removed to obtain the light-conversion film. The LEDs were prepared by encapsulating as-prepared phosphors with 380 nm chips.
Characterization and instrumentation
The X-ray diffraction data (XRD) were obtained using a Bruker D2 PHASER X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54178 Å) to test the phase purity of SAO:x%Eu2+,y%Mn4+. The working voltage and operation current were 30 kV and 10 mA, respectively. The 2θ range was from 10° to 80°, and the step length was 0.02°. Based on the standard XRD data, Rietveld refinement in the GSAS program was carried out for structure simulation. The energy band structure of SAO was studied using the Vienna ab initio simulation Package (VASP) under density functional theory (DFT). The morphology and elements of SAO:x%Eu2+,y%Mn4+ were examined by scanning electron microscopy (Hitachi S-3400) and energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). A FEI TecnaiF30 transmission electron microscope (TEM) was operated at a voltage of 300 kV to produce high-resolution TEM images. A Kratos AXIS Ultra DLD X-ray photoelectron spectrometer equipped with an Al K radiation source was used to obtain the X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS). A PerkinElmer 950 spectrometer was utilized to measure the diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) of SAO:x%Eu2+,y%Mn4+. An Fl3-21 Fluorescence spectrometer (Horiba) was used to characterize the spectra of the photoluminescence (PL), photoluminescence excitation (PLE) and thermal photoluminescence properties. An FS5 spectrofluorometer (Edinburgh Instruments) was used to measure the decay lifetime. X-ray absorption near edge structure spectra (XANES) were measured using the BL02U1 in the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility. A Canon EOS 4000D smart camera was used to take all of the digital photos. The electro-luminescence spectrum (EL), colour rendering index (Ra) and CIE colour coordinates of the LED were evaluated using a LED luminous intensity distribution tester equipped with an integrating sphere and a digital CC&CV DC power supply (EVERFINE PHOTO-E-INFO Co., Ltd).
Results and discussion
From the Rietveld refinement results, the specific crystal structure information of SAO was obtained, as shown in Fig. 1(a) and Tables S1–S12 (ESI†). The residual factors Rp and Rwp for the SAO host matrix were 8.47% and 11.33%, respectively, which also reveal that those values are reliable. There is an orthorhombic structure, which belongs to the Pmma space group. Based on a comparison of the standard (ICSD 27744) and the measured data, there are no impurity phases, indicating that the sample is a single phase. Additionally, the crystal structure of Sr4Al14O25 is illustrated in Fig. 1(b). The unit cell is composed of a Sr–O polyhedron and its common-vertex-connected surrounding Al–O polyhedra, and these constitute the rigid framework structure. Furthermore, the XRD patterns in the series of samples SAO:x%Eu2+, SAO:y%Mn4+, and SAO:0.1%Eu2+,y%Mn4+ were explored (0 ≤ x% ≤ 0.12%, 0 ≤ y% ≤ 4.0%), as illustrated in Fig. S1(a), (b) (ESI†) and Fig. 1(c). All XRD peak shapes and angles are consistent with the standard data of Sr4Al14O25 (JCPDS#52-1876) and the refinement data. The diffraction peak of SAO:x%Eu2+ at 25°–26° moves toward higher angle with increasing Eu2+ content, proving that Eu2+ can be introduced into the lattice and that the interplanar spacing decreases. Similarly, the same diffraction peak moves to a higher angle in series of Mn4+-doped and Eu2+–Mn4+ co-doped samples. To explain this, as shown in Fig. 1(b), there are two Sr2+ sites, Sr1 in [SrO7] (rCN=7 = 1.21 Å) polyhedra and Sr2 in [SrO10] (rCN=10 = 1.36 Å) polyhedra, which can be occupied by the smaller Eu2+ (rCN=7 = 1.20 Å, rCN=10 = 1.35 Å).27 When Eu2+ tends to occupy the sites of Sr2+, the lattice undergoes a slight contraction distortion, according to the Bragg equation (2dsinθ = nλ), leading the diffraction peak to shift to larger angles, as shown in Fig. S1(a) (ESI†). Mn4+ (rCN=6 = 0.53 Å) tends to occupy the Al3+ (rCN=6 = 0.535 Å) site, leading to the peak shifting towards larger angles, as shown in Fig. 1(c) and Fig. S1(b) (ESI†).28 Based on the refinement results, the relationships between the cell parameters, cell volume and the concentration of doped ions are depicted in Fig. 1(d) and Fig. S1(c), (d) (ESI†). As the concentration of Mn4+ or Eu2+ rises, the parameters a, b and c continuously decrease, indicating that the Mn4+ or Eu2+ is doped into the lattice and the interplanar spacing decreases, as does the cell volume.

Fig. 2(a)–(h) show the morphology of SAO:0.1%Eu2+,0.4%Mn4+ by using the mapping-scan images and EDX spectrum. All the elements composing the samples (Sr, Al, O, Eu, Mn) are detected, excluding other impurity elements. The irregular particles have a rough surface and a particle size of 6.97 μm on average, as displayed in Fig. S2 (ESI†). The yellow-marked distance is 1.434 nm in the HRTEM image shown in the inset in Fig. 2(i), which corresponds to the (14 3 1) crystal plane in SAO:0.1% Eu2+,0.4%Mn4+. The electron microscopy results are in agreement with the above XRD analysis.

The calculated band structure is presented in Fig. 3(a), according to density functional theory (DFT) based on the VASP results of the SAO matrix sample. The bottom of the conduction band (CB) and the top of the valence band (VB) are positioned at point G and point S of the Brillouin region, respectively. This implies that the SAO matrix has an indirect band gap of 3.85 eV. Fig. 3(b) exhibits the calculated results of the total density of states (DOS) and partial density of states (PDOS) of the SAO host. According to the VASP results, the VB is predominantly composed of the 2p orbitals of O, while the 3d orbitals of Sr provided the CB, with the s and p orbitals of Al also making contributions to the CB. The absorption spectra were carried out to assess the accuracy and consistency of the optical band gap result and are exhibited in Fig. 3(c). The Eg value could be found by using the junction of the linear extrapolation of the hν value and the x axis, yielding a result of 3.58 eV in the SAO host, which is rather close to the band gap calculated previously. The errors arise from the correlation function calculation; such errors could come from both the measurement and the estimation.

The wide XPS spectra of Sr4Al14O25 and more details about Al, O, and Sr, are depicted in Fig. 4(a)–(c). The fine XPS spectra of Al and O are shown in Fig. 4(b). The single peaks for both indicate that only one chemical state of Al and O exists in the sample SAO:0.1%Eu2+,0.4%Mn4+. In Fig. 4(c), the fine XPS spectrum of Sr shows 3d3/2 and 3d5/2 peaks due to spin–orbit splitting of the Sr 3d levels. Furthermore, the fine structure of the spectrum can be divided into two components subscripted as i and ii, which peaked at 135.3 eV (3d3/2)i, 133.6 eV (3d5/2)i, 134.6 eV (3d5/2)ii, and 132.9 eV (3d5/2)ii, respectively. This also indicated that there are two chemical environments of Sr ions in the SAO host, which matches well with the two sites analyzed in the structure part and Fig. 1(b). Additionally, the distance between these double components is close to the standard binding energy of Sr 3d (Δ = 1.79 eV). To verify the valence of the doped ions in the samples, the XPS fine spectra of the elements Mn and Eu in different samples are depicted in Fig. 4(d)–(e), using MnO2 and MnCO3 as standard samples of Mn. As shown in Fig. 4(d)(I–II), the 2p1/2 and 2p3/2 orbitals of Mn2+ in the standard MnCO3 sample are located at 653.45 eV and 641.41 eV respectively, with a difference of about 12.0 eV.29,30 In comparison with Mn2+, the peak positions of Mn4+ shift toward the high-energy direction in the standard MnO2 sample, whose 2p1/2 and 2p3/2 orbitals are located at 654.11 eV and 642.03 eV, respectively. A singly doped Mn element sample sintered in air has a valence of +4, whereas after co-doping with the elements Eu and Mn under the same conditions, the peak position of Mn moves to lower energy, indicating that the valence of the Mn changes and that some divalent compounds are generated. This is related to the self-reduction phenomenon observed in the Mn.18 The element Eu appears to have a trivalent valence simultaneously, which was not expected. Unfortunately, co-doping and sintering in a reducing atmosphere will cause the valence of Eu and Mn to become divalent. Strategically, only under the two-step method does Eu appear divalent, while the Mn element has a valence of +4, as illustrated in Fig. 4d(III–VI).

(d) High-resolution XPS spectra of Mn 2p and (e) Eu 3d in SAO:Eu2+,Mn4+ prepared in different situations. (f) XANES at the Eu-L3 edge in samples under different atmospheres. 
The 3d3/2 and 3d5/2 peaks of Eu3+ in the standard sample Eu2O3 appear at 1164.45 eV and 1134.66 eV, respectively, with a distance of 29.8 eV.31 Similarly, the divalent Eu peaks are biased toward the lower energy region. As shown in Fig. 4(e)(II–V), when sintered in a reducing atmosphere, Eu exhibits divalence, but when sintered in air, it moves toward higher energy and exhibits trivalence. Thus, divalent Eu must be prepared in a reducing environment. As a conclusion, after the first calcination under different atmospheres, the second-step method sintering under nitrogen maintains the valence of Eu as divalent and the valence of Mn as tetravalent, demonstrating the reliability of the chosen method.
The valence of Eu could also be estimated by XANES. The results of XANES at the Eu-L3 edge in samples under different atmospheres and a standard sample (BAM:Eu2+) are shown in Fig. 4(f). In the Eu–Mn co-doped SAO sample sintered under air, double peaks appeared at the Eu-L3 edge (dotted grey line). The lower energy edge at 6974 eV corresponded to Eu2+, while the higher energy edge at 6981 eV stemmed from Eu3+ ions.32 Comparing the samples prepared under the three atmospheres, it is clear that the SAO:Eu–Mn sample sintered in a reducing atmosphere contains only Eu2+, while in the SAO:Eu–Mn sample prepared under air, both valences exist. Only in the SAO:Eu–Mn sample prepared according to the two-step method did the Eu ions remain divalent, which is consistent with the previous XPS analysis.
Energy transfer efficiency
The photoluminescence properties of the singly doped series samples (SAO:x%Eu2+, SAO:y%Mn4+) are illustrated in Fig. S(3) and S(4) (ESI†).
In Fig. S3(a) (ESI†), there is an overlapped area between the PL spectra of Eu2+ and the PLE spectra of Mn4+, suggesting that energy transfer from Eu2+ to Mn4+ ions could occur. Hence, a series of samples were generated to further explore the energy transfer process between the Eu2+ and Mn4+ ions in the SAO host lattice. According to Fig. S3(c) (ESI†), in the series of SAO:x%Eu2+,0.1%Mn4+(0 ≤ x% ≤ 0.12%) samples, the absorption intensity increases and reaches a maximum when the Eu2+ concentration is 0.1%, and subsequently decreases, which is coherent with the change in the PLE spectra shown in the inset. Therefore, in the series of SAO:Eu–Mn samples, the concentration of Eu2+ was kept constant at 0.1% while the Mn4+ content was changed between 0 and 4%. The emission spectra of the SAO:0.1%Eu2+,y%Mn4+ (0 ≤ y% ≤ 4.0%) phosphors is depicted in Fig. 5(a). The emission spectra all feature a cyan-green emission band of the Eu2+ ions and a prominent red emission peak at 652 nm due to the specific characteristic transition of Mn4+, with the exception of the singly doped Eu2+. Additionally, continuously changing coordinates from green to red in the CIE chromaticity diagram of SAO:0.1%Eu2+,y%Mn4+ particles upon 360 nm excitation can be observed in Fig. 5(b). The color can be changed from green to yellow, to red, with the corresponding coordinates ranging from (0.1881, 0.6693) to (0.4472, 0.4852) and (0.5661, 0.3974), respectively.

Fig. 5(c) clearly illustrates the dependence of the intensities of the 4f–5d transition of Eu2+ at 490 nm and the characteristic transition of Mn4+ at 652 nm as a function of Mn4+ concentrations, respectively. The relative emission intensities of the Eu2+ ions decreased noticeably with increasing Mn4+ concentrations, which can be attributed to an increase in energy transfer from the Eu ions to the Mn ions, whereas the relative emission intensities of Mn increased initially and peaked at y = 0.4, after which they decreased due to Mn–Mn internal concentration quenching.
It is of significance to determine the critical distance of energy transfer Rc using the concentration quenching approach, with the critical distance REu2+–Mn4+ between Eu2+ and Mn4+ being approximated using the equation based on Blasse's theory, as shown in Formula S1 in the ESI.† In this case, V = 1021 Å3 and Z = 2. xc is the critical concentration, which is equal to the sum of the sensitizer ion and activator ion concentrations when the emission of the series of SAO:0.1%Eu2+,y%Mn4+ phosphors reaches the maximum. Herein, the xc of 0.005 implies that the Eu2+ ion concentration is 0.001 and the Mn4+ ion concentration is 0.004. The critical transfer distance between Eu2+ to Mn4+ in the SAO particles is then estimated to be 58.0 Å.
In this case, the concrete mechanism was analyzed. Generally, energy transfer happens from a sensitizer to an activator via electric multipolar interaction.33 The following relation can be derived using Dexter's energy transfer expressions for multipolar interaction and Reisfeld's approximation, as illustrated below:34 (1)
For which η0 and ηs denote the luminescence quantum efficiencies of Eu2+ in the absence and presence of Mn4+, respectively; the values of η0/ηs can be approximated by the ratio of relative luminescence intensity (IS0/IS); C indicates the sum of the Eu2+ and Mn4+ concentrations. The relationship (IS0/IS) ∝ CEu2++Mn4+ corresponds to the exchange interaction, and n = 6, 8, and 10 for d–d, d–q, and q–q interactions, respectively. The relationships between (IS0/IS) and  are illustrated in Fig. 5(d). The linear relationship reaches the optimal one for (IS0/IS)  when d equals 6 by comparing the R values in Fig. 5(d), implying that energy transfer from Eu2+ to Mn4+ occurs via the d–d interaction. As pointed out by Wright et al., clustering is dominant in the present system, and then exchange interactions might be important and in fact might be the reason for the energy transfer efficiency.35
Factually, to investigate the luminescence dynamics, the PL decay curves of Eu2+ in SAO:0.10%Eu2+,y%Mn4+ were monitored at two luminescence centers and followed using lifetime calculations as well as the energy transfer (E–T) efficiencies monitored at 492 nm, as presented in Fig. 6(a) and (b). The decay curve of the singly doped SAO:0.10%Eu2+ particles can be well matched with a typical double-exponential function with a lifetime of about 5258 ns. With the addition of Mn4+ ions, the decay curves of the Eu2+ ions deviate significantly from the original curves, indicating that the doped Mn4+ influences the emission of the Eu2+ ions. The observed non-exponential character is accounted for by the clusters in this case. It is accepted that clustering would create either Eu2+–Eu2+ clusters or Eu2+–Mn4+ clusters, with differing exponential decay rates for the two types of clusters. Since the decay curves are non-exponential, the decay process of these samples is described by average lifetime (τ), which can be determined using eqn (2),36 (2)in which I(t) is the intensity at time t. Based on the above equation, the decay durations decline continuously from 5258 ns to 1893, 1504, 1065, and 983 ns for the SAO:0.10%Eu2+,y%Mn4+ samples as the corresponding concentrations of Mn4+ progressively increase from y = 0 to 0.04, 0.1, 1, and 4%, respectively. The decay time decreases monotonically as the Mn4+ concentration increases, implying that the emission intensity of the Eu2+ ions declines and that of the Mn4+ ions simultaneously increases, strongly demonstrating the energy transfer from Eu2+ to Mn4+. The following equation can be used to calculate the E–T efficiency (ηT) of energy transfer from the Eu2+ to the Mn4+ ions.37 (3)Here, τs0 and τs represent the lifetimes of Eu2+ in the absence and presence of Mn4+, respectively. The energy transfer efficiency from the sensitizer Eu2+ ion to the activator Mn4+ ion is estimated using the above equation and the as-calculated lifetimes. In addition, the variation of ηT is also plotted as a function of the Mn4+ concentration in the right y-axis of Fig. 6(b). It can be found that the ηT is high, and the value reaches 71.4% even when the doping concentration is 0.1%. It then increases significantly with increasing Mn4+ dopant concentration. At the optimum Mn4+ concentration of 0.4%, the value of ηT is estimated to be 76.8%. As the Mn4+ concentration further rises from 1% to 4%, the ηT values remain virtually constant (from 79.7% to 81.3%), suggesting that the energy transfer is approaching saturation. The findings also demonstrate that the energy transfer pathway in the SAO host from the Eu2+ to the Mn4+ ions is quite efficient. When monitored at 407 nm, the situation is similar, as illustrated in Fig. 6(c) and (d). The lower efficiency suggested the energy transfer at the Eu2 site is less than that at the Eu1 site due to the smaller overlapped area in the excitation spectrum of Mn4+ and emission spectrum of Eu2+.

Energy transfer mechanism
Based on the above details, it is considered that  can form defect clusters as  or  for charge compensation.38–40 This process can be influenced by the Mn4+ concentration of co-doped SAO:Eu–Mn samples and will lead to change in the relative intensities. As the Mn4+ concentration is low, the Mn4+ can be easily surrounded by Eu2+ due to the defect reactions  and naturally written as  which guarantees the energy transfer efficiency between Eu2+ and Mn4+. This is supported by the average distance between Eu2+ and Mn4+, which is less than the estimated critical distance of energy transfer Rc of 58.0 Å. The average distance between Eu2+ and Mn4+ is similar to the distance between Sr and Al. From the Rietveld refinement results shown in Tables S11 and S12 (ESI†), the average length of the Sr1–Al atoms is 3.4021 Å and the average length of the Sr2–Al atoms is 3.398 Å. These two average distances both are smaller than the critical distance of Rc of 58.0 Å.
When the Eu2+ concentration is exceeded by the Mn4+ concentration,  can be maintained in the initial state, while  increases significantly, leading to the Mn4+ assembling with itself, prompting the non-radiative process and the loss of emission intensity of Mn4+.
More specifically, the energy transfer process and mechanism are depicted in Fig. 7(a) and (b) using the crystal polyhedron transition schematic and the energy level diagrams of Eu2+ and Mn4+. During the second sintering, to achieve a more stable state, the ions in the lattice and near the interface will move toward each other, forming an Eu–Mn co-doped SAO sample. On the left of Fig. 7(b), in the Eu2+-doped SAO sample, under the excitation of the near-ultraviolet light source, electrons transition from the ground state (4f7 level) to the excited state (4f65d level), and then most of the electrons return quickly due to the instability of the electrons in the excited state, which is accompanied by the release of photons, causing the cyan-green emission. Only a small number of electrons return to the ground state via non-radiative transitions. For the Mn4+-doped SAO sample, similarly, when exposed to UV light, electrons transition from the ground state (4A2 level) to the excited states (4T1, 4T2 and 2T2 levels), and the majority of electrons in the excited states relax to the 2Eg energy level before returning to the ground state (4A2 level) via a radiative transition with deep-red light emission, as shown on the right of Fig. 7(b).
 Fig. 7  (a) Crystal structure conversion and (b) sketch of the SAO:0.1%Eu2+,0.4%Mn4+ energy transfer mechanism. 
In the Eu–Mn co-doped samples, when Eu2+ was introduced as a sensitizer ion, the electrons in the excited state of Eu2+ were easily transferred to the excited states (2T2 and 4T2) of Mn4+ because the emission spectrum of Eu2+ overlapped with the excitation spectrum of Mn4+. Most of the electrons located at the 2T2 and 4T2 energy levels will relax to the 2Eg energy level and finally transition to the ground state, accompanied by the characteristic emission of the Mn4+ ion. Thus, the Eu2+ excited state energy level has only a small number of electrons remaining that can transition back to their ground state by radiation, so the emission peak intensity of Eu2+ at 490 nm will be relatively weakened, while the emission intensity of Mn4+ will be enhanced.
Thermal photoluminescence properties
The thermal stability of luminescent materials is an important parameter in their applications. In this case, the thermal quenching properties of the two samples with the best luminescence properties, SAO:0.2%Mn and SAO:0.1%Eu,0.4%Mn, are depicted in Fig. 8. As portrayed in Fig. 8(a) and (b), the shape and position of the emission spectra remain unchanged as the temperature increases, indicating that it still maintains the PL character of Mn4+, that is to say, it corresponds to the 2E → 4A2 radiative transition of Mn4+. The intensity of the emission decreases continuously as the temperature goes up. When the temperature is 150 °C, the Mn4+ emission intensities in the singly doped and co-doped samples are 51% and 33% those at the initial temperature, respectively. The activation energy ΔE, which reflects thermal stability, is calculated using the Arrhenius equation below to explain the thermal quenching performance of Mn4+:41 (10)where k represents the Boltzmann constant with a value of 1.380649 × 10−23 J K−1, c is a constant, and IT and I0 represent the emission intensity of Mn ions at the temperature T and the initial temperature, respectively. The final calculation result for the singly doped sample was 0.412 eV, as shown in Fig. 8(e). The activation energy is not very high, indicating that this phosphor has average thermal stability. Additionally, the thermal quenching property of SAO:0.1%Eu is revealed in Fig. S5 (ESI†); the emission intensities at 150 °C are 68% that at the initial temperature.

(b) The PL spectra and (d) relative emission intensity of SAO:0.1%Eu2+,0.4%Mn4+ at various temperatures. (e) The dependence of ln(I0/IT − 1) on (kT)−1. (f) Schematic diagram of the thermal quenching mechanism and the cross-relaxation pathway for SAO:0.1%Eu2+,0.4%Mn4+. 
As shown in Fig. 8(f), the thermal quenching phenomenon is described by the configuration coordinate diagram (CCD) of the activator ion. As the temperature increases, the lattice vibration intensifies, resulting in an increase in thermally active phonons. The excited state electrons are coupled with the active phonons, and then step across the potential energy barrier (ΔE) before reaching the intersection of the excited state 2Eg and the ground state 4A2g. Finally, the electrons along the way shown in the blue dotted line return to the ground state 4A2 rather than a radiative process, resulting in a decrease in emission intensity. Naturally, the luminescence process and non-radiative transitions are competitors, and which will be dominant depends on the temperature and crystal structure stability.
Specifically, for Eu2+, as shown on the left of Fig. 8(f), e1 and e2 represent the excited states of the Eu12+ and Eu22+ sites, respectively, and their thermal quenching is similar to that of Mn4+. The ion will reach the crossover point between the excited and ground states as the temperature rises. It then returns to the ground state without luminescence. The difference is that the energy of the excited electrons can also be transferred to the excited electrons in the Mn4+ ion. Moreover, as shown in Fig. S5(c) (ESI†), it is worth noting that the emission spectrum of e2 overlaps greatly with the excitation spectrum of e1, and there is also energy transfer between these two excited states.42 In other words, because the energy barrier between e1 and e2 is lower at slightly higher temperatures, electrons from e2 can easily reach the e1 state (shown by the purple dashed line in Fig. 8(f)), and more electrons reach the ground state from the e1 process, so the emission peak at Eu22+ site weakens with increasing temperature until it disappears, as seen in Fig. S6 (ESI†).
Applications
As concluded above, the emission of SAO:0.1%Eu2+,0.4%Mn4+ matches well with the absorption at 650–700 nm of chlorophyll A and B in photosynthesis, satisfying the needs of plant growth, as shown in Fig. 9(a).

(g) The electric light spectrum of a w-LED based on SAO:0.1%Eu2+,0.4%Mn4+ and a blue commercial phosphor with an n-UV chip. Insets are photographs of the red LED and w-LED, respectively. 
As indicated in Fig. S3(c) (ESI†), the samples can absorb sunlight and emit deep-red light; thus, the samples can be used to create a solar light conversion film for plant growth. Fig. 9(b) displays a photo of the light-converting film based on a SAO:0.1%Eu2+,0.4%Mn4+ phosphor under sunlight. Its mechanism and emission spectrum under sunlight are illustrated in Fig. 9(c) and (e); once the light-converting film is excited by sunlight, it emits light that can be absorbed by chlorophyll A and B to promote plant growth. Moreover, Fig. 9(d) depicts a rough plant growth experiment model by placing the film in front of Cosmos bipinnata Cav.
Additionally, two LED devices with 380 nm NUV chips were fabricated, and their electroluminescence spectra are exhibited in Fig. 9(f) and (g); one is based on SAO:0.2%Mn4+ with blue commercial phosphors, and the other one is based on SAO:SAO:0.1%Eu2+-0.4%Mn4+. It is easy to identify the special emission peak of Mn4+ at 652 nm, implying that it can be used as a red-emitting candidate with n-UV LEDs for plant growth, as shown in Fig. 9(f). The colors from 500 nm to 560 nm in the green region, however, were still missing. In Fig. 9(g), using the Eu2+–Mn4+ phosphors, there is no doubt that the strong emission peak at 652 nm was ascribed to Mn4+. The strong emission peak at 450 nm was derived from the blue commercial phosphors. The presence of Eu2+ ions was responsible for the significant enhancement in the intensity range from 480 nm to 550 nm. In addition, their coordinates are (0.5637, 0.4259) and (0.2945, 0.2998), with corresponding Ra values of 62.8% and 92.2%, respectively, suggesting that the SAO:0.1%Eu2+,0.4%Mn4+ phosphor emitting green and red light can be used as a potential white-emitting candidate for n-UV LEDs.
Based on the above, it is found that the sunlight-converting film based on the SAO:Eu–Mn phosphor has the potential to promote plant growth, because it possesses wide high-intensity red emission that could be absorbed by chlorophyll A and B.
Conclusion
In summary, a series of Eu2+–Mn4+ codoped deep-red emitting Sr4Al14O25:0.1%Eu2+,y%Mn4+ (0.04 ≤ y ≤ 4) phosphors with high energy transfer efficiency were successfully designed and prepared via a novel two-step high-temperature solid-state method. The crystal structure, optical performances and decay lifetime were thoroughly analyzed. The XPS and XANES spectra confirmed the +2 valence of Eu and the +4 valence of Mn prepared using the new two-step method and the absence of trivalent Eu. The PL spectra and TRPL spectra illustrate that there are two luminescent centers when the Sr2+ ions are substituted by Eu2+ ions at two different positions, and that Mn4+ ions occupy Al3+ lattices that are with octahedral lattices in this matrix. A possible mechanism of energy transfer based on defect theory and energy level was proposed. The energy transfer from Eu2+ to Mn4+ in the SAO host can originate from the dipole–dipole interaction, and the existence of the Eu2+–Mn4+ clusters results in a high energy transfer efficiency of up to 81.3%. The fabricated w-LED proves that the phosphors have a promising future in lighting. Both the light-converting film and LED based on Sr4Al14O25:Eu2+–Mn4+ phosphors demonstrated a high potential for promoting plant growth.
