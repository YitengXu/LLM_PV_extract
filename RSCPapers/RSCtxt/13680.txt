    , Accepted 2nd October 2018First published on 3rd October 2018AbstractOne-dimensional heterojunction nanorods are highly attractive as photoanodes for developing efficient photoelectrochemical (PEC) systems for the effective photogeneration of charge carriers and transport. ZnO/BiVO4 nanorod arrays (NRAs) are excellent candidates if their charge transferring and recombination issues can be improved. In the current work, we have studied the synergistic doping effects of N-doped ZnO/Mo-doped BiVO4 NRAs for enhancing the photoanode activity in PEC devices. The N-doping of ZnO NRs enhances the charge carrier density ∼3-fold over undoped ZnO NRs through increased oxygen vacancies induced by N dopants. The Mo dopants in BiVO4 improve the mobility of photogenerated charge carriers and contribute to reducing charge recombination. The synergistic doping effects of both ZnO and BiVO4 could increase the charge transfer rate constant (kct) of the ZnO:N/BiVO4:Mo heterojunction by ∼40% and decrease the charge transfer resistance ∼1.9-fold compared to those of undoped ZnO/BiVO4, which were confirmed by time resolved photoluminescence (PL) and electrochemical impedance (EIS) analyses. Our optimally fabricated ZnO:N/BiVO4:Mo NRA photoanode could achieve an excellent photocurrent of 3.62 mA cm−2 without the application of any co-catalysts. This work presents a useful strategy for designing efficient heterojunction photoanodes in PEC systems.
Introduction
Solar water splitting is currently attracting much attention as an eco-friendly, solar energy harvesting method, producing hydrogen, a solar fuel obtained from water and solar illumination.1,2 Hydrogen is a low-cost, high energy-density, and green source of energy to alleviate energy and environmental crises.3 Among the various methods of solar water splitting, a photoelectrochemical (PEC) cell4 is one of the most efficient methods because it can produce high solar to hydrogen (STH) conversion efficiency due to efficient charge generation, transfer and separation by the application of a small external bias.5 One of the crucial issues in realizing the PEC cell's main merits is the development of highly efficient and well-designed photoelectrodes: photoanodes or photocathodes.6
Various n-type metal oxide materials have been studied as efficient photoanodes of PEC devices due to suitable band bending for water oxidation at the interface with the electrolyte and high durability.7,8 In particular, ZnO is attractive as a promising photoanode because it has high electron mobility and can be easily anisotropically synthesized (one-dimensional synthesis), suitable to be applied as an electron deliverer.9,10 However, ZnO has a relatively wide band-gap energy (3.4 eV) and can absorb only UV light.11 To provide ZnO photoanodes with visible light absorption capability, various strategies of material modulations have been explored, such as doping, thermal treatment, and heterojunction formation.12–14 Recently, the doping of ZnO nanorods has been investigated to enhance their electrical and optical properties.15–17 Dopants can occupy mid-gap states between band-gaps,14 or the doping mechanism generally augments their electron carrier density due to an increase in oxygen vacancies from the imperfect crystal structure.15 In many cases, transition metal dopants substitute the Zn2+ site,15,18 while nonmetal anionic dopants such as N3− or F− ions substitute the O2− site in the ZnO lattice.16,19
Heterojunction formation of ZnO with lower bandgap semiconductors is another effective way to improve the photoanodic activity of ZnO in the visible solar light region.12,20–23 As a narrow, direct bandgap n-type semiconductor, BiVO4 is an excellent candidate for the formation of the ZnO/BiVO4 heterojunctions.24,25 BiVO4 can absorb visible light due to a narrow band gap energy of 2.4 eV and generate a low onset potential with a fast photocurrent increase in PEC, which can achieve 7.5 mA cm−2 of the theoretical maximum photocurrent.26–28 Additionally, the type-II band alignment of BiVO4 with ZnO facilitates charge transfer at the ZnO/BiVO4 heterojunction. However, the fast recombination, a chronic drawback of BiVO4, is still present in the heterojunction due to the short diffusion length of the charge carrier. To overcome this inherent limitation of BiVO4, one of the possible solutions is doping of BiVO4, which can increase the charge carrier density and mobility, thus reducing recombination and enhancing the photoanodic performances of the heterojunction structure based on BiVO4.29,30
In this work, we have studied the synergistic doping effects of a ZnO:N/BiVO4:Mo bunched nanorod array (NRA) photoanode for enhancing the charge transfer and carrier density in the PEC system. Although single, separate doping of ZnO and BiVO4 has been studied, the doping of both materials in the heterojunction has not yet been explored. This work is the first study investigating the synergistic doping effects of the ZnO/BiVO4 heterojunction.24,25 Through a systematic investigation of the charge transfer dynamics and carrier density, we found that the ZnO:N/BiVO4:Mo NRA photoanode has a highly improved charge transfer rate and an increased carrier density compared to its undoped counterpart. For this study, a ZnO nanorod (NR) array was first prepared by a hydrothermal method, and then BiVO4 was spray-coated on the ZnO NR array using metal organic decomposition to obtain the ZnO/BiVO4 heterojunction. ZnO NRs were doped with N through NH3 ambient annealing and BiVO4 was doped with Mo by the solution growth process. According to the Mott–Schottky analysis results, the electron density of ZnO NRs increased over ∼3-fold after N doping. The Mo-doping of BiVO4 improved the charge transfer rate constant (kct) of the heterojunction by ∼40% for ZnO:N/BiVO4:Mo compared to undoped ZnO/BiVO4, which was confirmed by time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) decay analysis. These combined effects increase the photocurrent density of ZnO:N/BiVO4:Mo bunched NRs to ∼3.62 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE, which is approximately 2.2-fold higher than that of ZnO/BiVO4. Our work presents a useful strategy for designing optimal photoanodes to improve their charge carrier density and transfer by the synergistic doping effects of the heterojunction structures.
Experimental and analysis methods
Growth and N-doping of ZnO nanorod arrays (NRAs)
ZnO NRAs are synthesized on a F-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrate by the hydrothermal solution reaction. First, the FTO glass substrate is washed with distilled water, acetone, and ethanol in an ultrasonic bath. After washing, a ZnO seed layer of ∼30 nm thickness is deposited on FTO glass by RF magnetron sputtering with 100 W of power at 8 mTorr of Ar pressure. The ZnO NRAs are grown on the seed layer in an aqueous solution containing 10 mM Zn(NO3)2 × 6H2O and 1 wt% of ammonium hydroxide. The hydrothermal reaction is conducted at 95 °C for 12 hours. After the growth, the nanorod arrays are washed with distilled water and dried in an oven.10 The ZnO NRAs are doped with nitrogen using annealing treatment in a reducing environment. The ZnO NRAs are placed on an alumina boat and annealed at 600 °C, 0.5 Torr of NH3 pressure, for various times (1, 2, and 3 hours).
Fabrication of ZnO:N/BiVO4:Mo bunched nanorod arrays (NRAs)
Mo-doped BiVO4 is synthesized on FTO glass, ZnO, and ZnO:N NRAs using metal organic decomposition (MOD). First, 50 mM Bi(NO3)3 × 5H2O and VO(AcAc)2 are dissolved in a 1:3 mixture solution of acetic acid and acetylacetone. For Mo doping, bis(acetylacetonato) dioxomolybdenum is added in a specified ratio to a vanadium precursor in solution. The solution is spray coated on the sample surface twice in 3 ml at a distance of 50 cm from the sample on a hot plate at 250 °C. The solvent is evaporated for 10 minutes on the hot plate, and the sample is annealed at 500 °C in a box furnace for 1 hour. After cooling, the spraying–annealing process is repeated for one more cycle.
Characterization of ZnO:N and BiVO4:Mo
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the prepared samples are acquired with an SEM JSM 7800F PRIME (5 keV). The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) data of nanostructures including low-resolution TEM, high-resolution TEM (HRTEM), and electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) are obtained using a TEM JEOL JEM-2200Fs (with image Cs-correction). X-ray diffraction patterns are obtained with a high-resolution X-ray diffractometer (D/MAX-2500) operated at 40 kV and 100 mA. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy is performed using a VG Scientific ESCALAB 250 for studying the chemical binding states of the components. UV-vis spectra are measured with a spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, UV2501PC attached with an ISR-2200 integrating sphere). Photoluminescence spectra (PL) and time resolved PL (TRPL) data are acquired by using an inverted-type scanning confocal microscope (PicoQuant, MicroTime-200). The excitation source is a 375 nm single-mode pulsed diode laser delivering a ∼100 ps pulse width at a 5–20 MHz repetition rate for TRPL measurements. To obtain the PL decay kinetics as a function of time, the time-correlated single-photon counting technique is used. Secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS) analysis was performed using a Cs+ gun at 5 keV, 50 nA (CAMECA, IMS 6F).
Fabrication of the PEC cell and photocurrent measurements
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) cells are fabricated for measuring the photocurrent, for Mott–Schottky analysis, and for electrochemical impedance (EIS) analysis. The prepared photoanode samples are connected with copper wire and a typical three-electrode potentiostat system (EG&G Princeton Applied Research, model 263A). Measurements are conducted under one-sun irradiation (AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2) in 0.5 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution. Pt mesh and saturated Ag/AgCl are used as a counter and a reference electrode, respectively. The Mott–Schottky analysis is performed under dark conditions at a frequency of 10 kHz at 1.23 V vs. RHE. EIS measurements are conducted in the dark from 107 to 103 Hz at 1.23 V vs. RHE. The incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurement is conducted in 0.5 M NaSO4 at 1.23 V vs. RHE.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1(a) shows the SEM images of ZnO (i) and ZnO:N (ii) NRAs and ZnO/BiVO4 NRAs (iii–iv). Fig. 1(a) (i) and (ii) are the top view images of ZnO and ZnO:N NRAs, respectively. In the inset of Fig. 1(a) (i), the cross-section SEM image shows that the hydrothermally grown ZnO NRAs are vertically aligned with a high density and their lengths are approximately 5 μm. The thickness and length of the ZnO NRAs can be controlled by varying the concentration of ammonia added in the reactant solution.10 In the inset of Fig. 1(a) (ii), the alignment of the NRAs becomes slightly disordered after doping, but there is no change in the average length of the NRAs. After the deposition of BiVO4 on the ZnO NRAs, the upper ends of the nanorods were bunched together, as seen in Fig. 1(a) (iii) and (iv). BiVO4 covers ZnO nanorods to form core–shell structures and gathers five to seven nanorods on average to form bunched structures. The Mo doping of BiVO4 did not cause any morphological change compared to the undoped sample.

The detailed heterojunction structure, the crystal lattice, and the elemental mapping of nanorods were investigated with TEM analysis. The TEM image in Fig. 1(b) clearly shows a core–shell structure of a single heterojunction nanorod, where a lumpy BiVO4 shell surrounds the ZnO nanorod. The BiVO4 shell layer consists of rather large clusters of approximately 50 nm (in Fig. 1(b) (1)) and many smaller nanoparticles of 4–10 nm (in Fig. 1(b) (2)). More detailed TEM analysis results of ZnO, ZnO:N, BiVO4, and BiVO4:Mo, and the fast Fourier transform (FFT) index of ZnO:N/BiVO4:Mo are provided in the ESI (Fig. S1†). HRTEM is also employed to investigate a detailed atomic level structure of the ZnO/BiVO4 NRAs. The resultant image in Fig. 1(b) (2) indicates that a core ZnO nanorod is grown as a single crystalline structure along the c-axis growth direction with its ZnO (002) lattice spacing of 0.26 nm.14 Additionally, BiVO4 nanoparticles in the shell show a BiVO4 (121) crystal lattice spacing of 0.31 nm.31 The EELS elemental mapping images shown in Fig. 1(b) (3)–(8) confirm the corresponding distribution of Zn, O, N, Bi, V, and Mo elements, respectively, in the ZnO:N/BiVO4:Mo nanorod. Compared with the undoped samples of ZnO and BiVO4, the doped samples clearly show the appearance of dopants in each sample as seen in the elemental mapping results (Fig. S1†). However, there is no change in the lattice size of ZnO and BiVO4 samples after doping.
The crystallinity of the samples was also characterized by XRD analysis, and the obtained spectra are shown in Fig. 1(c). Undoped and N-doped ZnO NRAs show almost the same XRD patterns with the most dominant peak at 34.6° corresponding to ZnO (002) (JCPDS No. 36-1451). There are no shifts in the XRD peak positions of ZnO NRAs observed with N-doping. The XRD patterns of undoped and Mo-doped BiVO4 samples were also obtained, and the results show almost identical XRD peak positions for both samples with the most dominant peak at 29.02° corresponding to BiVO4 (121) (JCPDS No. 14-0688). These results indicate that the crystallinity of ZnO and BiVO4 was not noticeably degraded after N and Mo doping.
The chemical binding states of the doped samples were analyzed by XPS, and the results are shown in Fig. 2 and 3 for ZnO and BiVO4, respectively. Fig. 2(a) shows the XPS spectra of the Zn 2p core-level region of undoped and N-doped ZnO NRAs. The spectra could be fitted to two peaks at 1021 and 1045 eV corresponding to the Zn 2p3/2 and Zn 2p1/2 core levels of Zn–O bonds, respectively. In the case of Zn, no noticeable peak position change was found upon N-doping of ZnO because the core-level of Zn 2p of the Zn–O bond is known to be the same as that of the Zn–N bond.32 In the case of the N 1s XPS spectra seen in Fig. 2(b), after N-doping, the ZnO NRAs clearly show the increased peak intensity of N 1s, which can be deconvoluted into two Gaussian curves, positioned at 397.5 and 400.2 eV. A strong peak at 397.5 eV is observed only in the doped sample, which corresponds to metal–nitrate bonding, suggesting that the doped N is bound with Zn. Another peak at a higher binding energy (400.2 eV, green curve) is also found for undoped ZnO NRAs as shown in the inset of Fig. 2(b) with almost the same peak height. This peak is thought to originate from the chemical binding of nitrogen with carbon of impurities, which include amine groups (C–NH2) in ZnO.33 Additionally, the O 1s spectra of undoped and N-doped ZnO NRAs are shown in Fig. 2(c) and (d), respectively. They are deconvoluted into two Gaussian curves corresponding to the lattice oxygen of ZnO (530.5 eV, red curve) and the oxygen vacancy (531.8 eV, green curve). When comparing undoped and doped samples, it is found that the oxygen vacancy peak is highly intensified after the N doping of ZnO. This result indicates that N-doping increases oxygen vacancies in ZnO, which can increase the carrier density. It is known that oxygen vacancies make a metal oxide a native n-type semiconductor through a reaction: O2− → VO + 2e−. Since the sizes of oxygen and nitrogen ions are different, the lattice structure is distorted upon the N-doping of ZnO, and oxygen defects are generated in the crystal. According to the quantitative analysis of the XPS spectra, ∼4 mol% of nitrogen is doped into ZnO NRAs when annealed in a reducing environment for 2 hours. This result is consistent with that obtained from the SIMS analysis of N-doped ZnO. The SIMS results are presented in Fig. S2(a) and (b) of the ESI.† The integrated N ion's intensity of N-doped ZnO in the depth profile is about 3.4% of the integrated O ion's intensity.

N 1s XPS peaks are deconvoluted into two subpeaks at 397.5 and 400.2 eV corresponding to N-bonding with lattice Zn and impurities, respectively. The inset of (b) shows an N 1s spectrum from undoped ZnO NRAs and (c) and (d) O 1s spectra of the undoped and N-doped ZnO NRAs, respectively. O 1s XPS peaks are deconvoluted into two subpeaks at 530.5 and 531.8 eV corresponding to lattice oxygen and oxygen vacancies, respectively. 
 Fig. 3  XPS spectra of (a) Bi 4f, (b) V 2p, (c) O 1s, and (d) Mo 3d obtained from undoped and Mo-doped BiVO4. 

Fig. 3 shows the XPS spectra of undoped and Mo-doped BiVO4, which are deposited on FTO glass for XPS analysis. Fig. 3(a) shows the XPS spectra of the Bi 4f core-level of undoped (black dots) and Mo-doped (red dots) BiVO4, both of which have two split peaks of Bi 4f7/2 (∼159.4 eV) and Bi 4f5/2 (∼164.7 eV). A slight shift to a higher binding energy by approximately 0.1 eV is observed in Bi 4f XPS peaks after the Mo doping of BiVO4, (Fig. 3(a)), which is also observed for the V 2p and O 1s spectra (Fig. 3(b) and (c)). When a metal element with a higher electronegativity is doped into a metal–oxide, the binding energy of each component increases.34 Mo has higher electronegativity than V, which can explain the higher binding energy shifts of Bi 4f, V 2p, and O 1s spectra. More clear evidence of Mo doping is shown in Fig. 3(d) for the Mo 3d XPS spectra. No peaks are observed for the undoped sample, but two split peaks appeared for Mo-doped BiVO4 at 232.6 eV and 235.9 eV corresponding to Mo 3d5/2 and Mo 3d3/2, respectively. Because their positions are identical to those of MoO3,35 it is expected that Mo dopants are chemically bonded to O. These results suggest that Mo substitutes V in the lattice to form Bi–Mo–O bonds in BiVO4:Mo instead of Mo–V–O bonds. The substitutional doping mechanism can be suggested as follows: V5+ + Mo → V + Mo6+ + e−, indicating that the electron density of BiVO4 will increase with Mo doping. According to the quantitative analysis of the XPS, Mo is doped by 1 mol% to V, and it is consistent with Mo fraction to V precursor in the synthesis process. This result is consistent with that obtained from the SIMS analysis of Mo-doped BiVO4. The SIMS results are presented in Fig. S2(c) and (d) of the ESI.† The integrated Mo ion's intensity of the Mo-doped BiVO4 in the depth profile is about 1.2% of the integrated V ion's intensity.
The ZnO:N/BiVO4:Mo heterostructured NRAs are expected to be highly efficient photoanodes in a photoelectrochemical (PEC) system due to their enhanced charge carrier density and effective charge transfer. Before the evaluation of PEC performances, the doping levels of ZnO and BiVO4 were both optimized by measuring photocurrent generation under varied doping conditions, as seen in Fig. S3.† The N doping level of the ZnO NRAs is controlled by regulating the annealing time in an NH3 environment. Linear-sweep voltammetry curves of pristine ZnO NRAs and N doped ZnO NRAs for various annealing times were obtained with voltage sweeping of 0–1.5 V vs. RHE under one-sun illumination. With the increasing reductive annealing duration from 0 to 2 hours, the photocurrent density of ZnO NRAs increases drastically from 0.05 to a maximum of 0.3 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE. This is attributed to the increased electron density by nitrogen doping. When the annealing duration is too long, over 2 hours, the photocurrent density is prominently decreased, and the dark current appears. Over-doped N dopants are interstitially doped between ZnO lattices, which form deep defect states in ZnO to work as recombination sites, reducing PEC photoactivity.36 Moreover, the increased dark current is caused by the degraded crystal structure originating from harsh annealing conditions. The combination of BiVO4 with N-doped ZnO affirms the optimum N-doping conditions as seen in Fig. S3(b).† The heterojunction formation of BiVO4 with ZnO drastically increases the photocurrent density due to extended light absorption by a narrow bandgap of BiVO4. The maximum photocurrent is observed when BiVO4 is deposited on ZnO:N (2 h) NRAs. In the next step, the Mo doping level of BiVO4 is also optimized. According to the photocurrent measurement results of ZnO/Mo-doped BiVO4 with various Mo concentrations (Fig. S3(c)†), the maximum photocurrent density is obtained at 1 mol% of Mo doping. Mo doping increases the electron density and enhances the mobility of charge carriers because Mo6+ ions have higher electronegativity than V5+ ions and more strongly attract electrons.29 At a higher Mo doping concentration of over 1 mol%, the increased dopant-induced recombination limits its PEC performance.37
Based on optimally doped ZnO:N and BiVO4:Mo, heterostructured NRA photoanodes of various combinations were prepared, and their PEC performances were evaluated as seen in Fig. 4(a). Undoped ZnO NRAs generate a very weak photocurrent (black curve) due to limited light absorption in the UV region. The heterostructured ZnO/BiVO4 NRAs drastically enhance the photocurrent because of the extended light absorption from narrow bandgap BiVO4 and facile charge transfer through the type II band structure of ZnO/BiVO4. When ZnO is doped with N, the ZnO:N/BiVO4 NRAs further increase the photocurrent due to the carrier density enhancement of the ZnO NRAs through N doping. The Mo doping of BiVO4 combined with the ZnO NRAs shows even higher photocurrent generation (blue curve), which is due to the recombination inhibition of BiVO4 through Mo doping. The maximum photocurrent generation is achieved by using a ZnO:N/BiVO4:Mo NRA photoanode. The synergistic doping effects could generate ∼3.62 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE under one-sun illumination, which is ∼2.2-fold higher than that of undoped ZnO/BiVO4 NRAs. The attained maximum photocurrent is comparable to the values reported in other cutting-edge studies based on BiVO4, although our current system does not apply any surface reaction catalysts.31,37,38Table 1 summarizes the PEC performances of various BiVO4/metal oxide heterojunction structures. Our system showed a higher photocurrent density than others in spite of the absence of any co-catalyst or hole scavenger.

The incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurement provides further understanding of the PEC performance dependent on the illumination wavelength. The IPCE value at each wavelength is calculated via the following equation: ,39 where ISC is the photocurrent, P is the power of the incident light of a specific wavelength, and λ is the incident wavelength. In Fig. 4(b), the IPCE spectra of heterojunctions of various combinations using undoped and doped materials are shown. All the heterojunction samples studied exhibit light absorption at wavelengths up to approximately 530 nm. The N doping of the ZnO NRAs does not change the wavelength range of the absorbed light but increases the IPCE in the overall range. It is also confirmed by the UV-vis absorption spectra of undoped and N doped ZnO NRAs, showing no noticeable change of the absorption range but a slight increase in absorbance (Fig. S4†). This increase in the absorbance of ZnO:N is caused by shallow-level mid-gap states of the N 2p core-level in ZnO.14 With increased light absorption, the improved electron-delivering capability of ZnO:N NRAs due to the increased electron density is the main cause of the increase in the IPCE. The Mo doping of BiVO4 remarkably increases the IPCE in the overall absorbable wavelength range, especially in the range of 460–520 nm.40 The enhanced light absorption and improved charge transfer with reduced recombination are believed to be the dominant causes of this peak-like IPCE enhancement. The light absorption spectra in Fig. S4† confirm that light absorption by Mo-doped BiVO4 is enhanced at the wavelength range of 420–500 nm compared to undoped BiVO4, which is thought to be due to the crystal distortion effect by dopants.41 Undoped BiVO4 has a low IPCE near the band edge (∼500 nm) because of fast recombination of charges, but Mo-doped BiVO4 can transfer the generated electrons with their higher electron mobility and efficiently suppress the charge recombination.
The improved charge transfer efficiency of the doped heterojunction was also confirmed by the analyses of steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra obtained from various heterojunction structures. Fig. 5(a) shows the PL spectra of four different heterojunction structures, exhibiting a wide range of PL curves from 500 to 800 nm for all samples with their characteristic intensity profiles. This steady-state PL originates from radiative charge recombination in BiVO4 and deep-level recombination in both ZnO and BiVO4. Compared to the undoped ZnO/BiVO4 sample, doped heterojunction structures showed decreased PL intensities, implying that recombination is much suppressed in doped samples compared with the undoped one. In particular, ZnO:N/BiVO4:Mo showed the lowest PL intensities, indicating that the most efficient charge transfer occurs on this heterostructure due to synergistic doping effects. As mentioned earlier, the doping of BiVO4 increases the mobility of the photogenerated electrons due to the higher electronegativity of the Mo6+ dopants and thus induces improved charge transfer efficiency. On the other hand, the N doping of ZnO increases its charge carrier density due to the increased oxygen vacancy in ZnO caused by N-doping. Combining these doping effects, ZnO:N/BiVO4:Mo efficiently enhances the charge transfer of photogenerated carriers and suppresses charge recombination.

A further study of the charge transfer dynamics was performed by TRPL analysis. The quantitatively decaying fluorescence lifetimes of various heterojunction structures were measured at the same wavelength range with PL, and the results are shown in Fig. 5(b). The TPRL curves are fitted using the equation , where I(t) is the PL intensity at time t, Ai is a corresponding amplitude value, τi is a lifetime value and ordinal i = 1, 2, and 3.42 From the calculated values of τi, the average PL lifetime of each heterojunction 〈τ〉 can be determined using the following equation: . The attained average carrier lifetimes of ZnO/BiVO4, ZnO:N/BiVO4, ZnO/BiVO4:Mo, and ZnO:N/BiVO4:Mo are 2.67, 2.31, 1.94, and 1.93 ns, respectively. All the parameters used in the calculations are presented in Table S1 of the ESI.† In these results, the shorter lifetime reflects faster charge transfer with higher efficiency. The charge-transfer kinetics between ZnO and BiVO4 is also analyzed. In heterojunction interfaces, the charge transfer rate constant can be evaluated using the following equation: , where kct is the rate constant of charge transfer between BiVO4 (or Mo-doped BiVO4) and ZnO (or ZnO:N), and 〈τ1〉 and 〈τ2〉 are the average carrier lifetimes of ZnO (or ZnO:N) and the heterojunction, respectively.43 For these calculations, the average lifetimes of ZnO and ZnO:N NRAs are also calculated, and the results are presented in Table S1.† With this information, the rate constants of the charge transfer for ZnO/BiVO4, ZnO:N/BiVO4, ZnO/BiVO4:Mo, and ZnO:N/BiVO4:Mo are obtained as 0.3743, 0.4334, 0.5166, and 0.5179 s−1, respectively. These results indicate that ZnO:N/BiVO4:Mo has the most highly increased kct, by 40% compared to that of the undoped ZnO/BiVO4 heterojunction, due to synergistic doping effects. In particular, the Mo doping of BiVO4 shows a dominant influence on the kct increase due to its mobility improvement by the dopants.
Additionally, the charge transfer dynamics at the interface of the photoanode and the electrolyte was also investigated by using EIS analysis. In Fig. 6(a), the semicircles represent the charge transfer resistances of the heterojunction structures. An equivalent circuit model is shown in the inset of Fig. 6(a), which consists of solution resistance (Rs), charge transfer capacitance (Cct), and resistance (Rct). All of these component values are fitted for each curve, and the fitting results are shown in Table S2.† The resultant charge transfer resistance values between 0.5 M Na2SO4 and ZnO/BiVO4, ZnO:N/BiVO4, ZnO/BiVO4:Mo, and ZnO:N/BiVO4:Mo are 4987, 4478, 3584, and 2601 Ω, respectively. Obviously, the doped heterojunction structure shows the smallest radius of semicircle curves, resulting in the smallest Rct value, reconfirming that this structure has the highest charge separation and transfer ability. Beside the EIS analysis, the Mott–Schottky measurement was also performed to investigate the effect of N-doping on the ZnO NRAs, which act as charge carrier transfer pathways in our PEC system. Fig. 6(b) shows the Mott–Schottky plots of undoped and N-doped ZnO NRAs. The electron density of the photoanode can be calculated by using a Mott–Schottky equation: , where Nd is the electron density of the photoanode, e0 is the electron charge, ε is the dielectric constant of the photoanode (ε = 8, typical value of bulk ZnO), ε0 is the permittivity of vacuum, C is the capacitance, and V is the applied bias at the photoanode.44 The Mott–Schottky plots in Fig. 6(b) are fitted to straight lines for determining slopes, from which electron densities are calculated. The resultant electron densities of undoped and N-doped ZnO NRAs are 2.42 × 1018 and 8.58 × 1018 cm−1, respectively. These results indicate that the N doping of ZnO NRAs significantly increases the electron density by approximately 3.55 times compared to the undoped one, which is due to their increased oxygen vacancies upon N-doping.

Summing up all the analysis results of ZnO/BiVO4 heterojunction NRAs, the ZnO:N/BiVO4:Mo NRAs are optimally designed photoanodes for water oxidation in photoelectrochemical (PEC) cells due to their capability of wide light absorption, efficient charge separation and transport. As shown in the scheme of the PEC system (Fig. 7), the type-II band alignment of ZnO:N and BiVO4:Mo facilitates charge transfer at the junction. The high mobility of Mo-doped BiVO4 and the high carrier density of N-doped ZnO also contribute to increased charge transfer and reduced charge recombination in photoanodes. Combining this unique structure of bunched NRAs with the synergistic doping effects of ZnO:N/BiVO4:Mo facilitates the water oxidation reaction at the photoanode and the hydrogen generation at the counter Pt electrode in our PEC system, which finally enhances the photocurrent generation up to as high as ∼3.62 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE without applications of any co-catalysts.

Conclusion
This work presents the first study investigating the synergistic doping effects of ZnO/BiVO4 heterojunctions for enhancing charge transfer and carrier density to improve the photoanode's activity in PEC systems. For this study, the hydrothermally grown ZnO NRAs are doped with N using NH3 annealing and subsequently the Mo-precursor added solution growth of BiVO4 proceeds to deposit BiVO4:Mo on the ZnO:N NRAs to form bunched heterojunction NRAs. The crystal structures and chemical binding states of the doped materials are investigated using HRTEM, XRD, and XPS analyses. N dopants substituting O in the ZnO lattice increase the electron density of ZnO:N, resulting in 3.55 times increased electron density compared to undoped ZnO. On the other hand, Mo dopants substituting V in the BiVO4 lattice induce higher electron mobility, improving the charge transfer. The formation of a type-II ZnO:N/BiVO4:Mo heterojunction could realize these synergistic doping effects by enhancing the charge transfer rate constant (kct) by ∼40% for ZnO:N/BiVO4:Mo compared to undoped ZnO/BiVO4, which is confirmed by TPRL analysis. The EIS analysis results further show that the charge transfer resistance (Rct) of ZnO:N/BiVO4 Mo is ∼2 times lower than that of ZnO:N/BiVO4:Mo. The synergistic doping effects of ZnO:N/BiVO4:Mo could generate a photocurrent density as high as 3.62 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE, which is approximately 2.2 times higher than that of ZnO/BiVO4. In summary, our work presents a useful method to develop optimal, efficient heterojunction photoanodes for improving the charge carrier density and transport through rational doping of the components, which can be applied in future PEC devices.
