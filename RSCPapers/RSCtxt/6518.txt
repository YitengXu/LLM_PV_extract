    , Accepted 29th September 2021First published on 5th October 2021AbstractIn recent years, although the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of thermally stable all-inorganic CsPbI3 perovskite solar cells (PSCs) had shown a great progress, the most reported CsPbI3 PSCs suffered from the large open-circuit voltage (Voc) loss, which is related to severe nonradiative recombination and a mismatch in energy level at the transport layer/perovskite interface. In this work, europium acetate (EuAc3) as a multifunction interface material is chosen to modify the TiO2/perovskite interface, the crystal quality of CsPbI3 perovskite films is improved, and both bulk and interfacial defects are reduced effectively. Meanwhile, the energy levels arrangement between TiO2 and CsPbI3 perovskites is also optimized, corresponding the raised built-in electric field afford a strength force to accelerate the transport and extraction of charge carriers from CsPbI3 perovskites to TiO2. As a result, the performance of CsPbI3 PSCs is largely enhanced with the PCE of 16.76%. When an Ag electrode was replaced by Au, the PCE further improves to 17.92%, which is the highest for CsPbI3 PSCs with P3HT as the HTL ever reported. Besides, the CsPbI3 PSC with the EuAc3 modification layer maintains 84% of the initial PCE under continuous UV irradiation for 250 h in a nitrogen filled glovebox, being obviously higher than the control devices with only 40% of the initial PCE after UV irradiation for 100 h in the same environment.
Introduction
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted a lot of attention due to their high absorption coefficient, facile tunable band gap and excellent carrier mobility.1–7 After the rapid development for more than a decade, the photoelectric conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic–inorganic hybrid PSCs has been raised from 3.8% to 25.5%, which is comparable to silicon cells.8–10 However, with the intrinsic volatility of organic cations, such as methylammonium (MA+) and formamidinium (FA+), organic–inorganic hybrid PSCs suffer from poor thermal stability, which hinder their further development and commercial application.11–13 As a way to solve the mentioned problems, the cesium-based all-inorganic perovskites (CsPbX3 X = I, Br, Cl or their mixtures) are becoming a promising candidate because of excellent optoelectronic property and thermal stability.14,15 Among them, CsPbI3 with the narrowest band gap of around 1.7 eV shows the best prospect in getting the highest PCE.16 In 2015, Snaith first fabricated CsPbI3 PSCs with the PCE of 2.9%.17 And then, the PCE of CsPbI3 has been developed by leaps and bounds in the past few years. In 2020, seok prepared uniform, pinhole-free films by dropping methylamine chloride solution to accelerate the crystallization process of CsPbI3 perovskites, then further passivated surface defects by adding octylamine iodide, as the result, the PCE of CsPbI3 PSCs was boosted to 20.37%, which is the highest record so far.18
However, the PCE of CsPbI3 PSCs is far apart to the Shockley–Queisser limit of 28.64% because of the large open-circuit voltage (Voc) loss.19 For the most CsPbI3 PSCs ever reported showed a Voc loss of ∼0.7 V or higher.20–24,42 It is well known that the large Voc loss in CsPbI3 PSCs is mainly related to the severe nonradiative recombination occurring in the bulk and at the interfaces, owing to the poor crystal quality of CsPbI3 perovskites and mismatch in energy level at the transport layer/perovskite interface.25–27 Meng et al. significantly increased the Voc from 0.87 V to 1.07 V by the bottom surface and bulk passivation with barium hydroxide.20 Liu et al. modified the TiO2/perovskite interface using 5-amino-2,4,6-triiodoisophthalic acid (ATPA) for the better energy level tuning and surface passivation, and as a result, the Voc was improved from 1.01 V to 1.09 V.23 Thus, the modification of the bottom interface of the CsPbI3 perovskite is primary, not only for suppressing the nonradiative recombination by improving the quality of perovskite films and passivating the interface defects, but also for obtaining a well-matched energy level alignment.28–30
In this work, a rare earth salt of europium acetate (EuAc3) as a multifunction interface material was proposed to modify the TiO2/perovskite interface for high efficiency and stability CsPbI3 PSCs based on P3HT as a hole transport layer (HTL), which is cheap and doped-free compared with the commonly used Spiro-OMeTAD.31 In recent years, Ac− anions as passivating additives in perovskite precursors have been widely reported.32–35 Eu3+ ions, used in down-conversion luminescent materials36,37 have also been introduced into the perovskite precursor for reducing the defect density of perovskites.38–40 However, there are no reports on EuAc3 as an interface modification material. It is found that TiO2 modified by EuAc3 became a better substrate for getting high crystallinity, uniform and pinhole-free CsPbI3 perovskite films. As a result, both bulk and interfacial defects were reduced effectively, and thus the nonradiative recombination was suppressed. Afterwards, the energy levels arrangement between TiO2 and CsPbI3 perovskites was also optimized and the built-in electric field was improved, which afford a strength force to accelerate the transport and extraction of charge carriers from CsPbI3 perovskites to TiO2. Attributed to the suppressed nonradiative recombination and the fast electron transport and extraction, the performance of P3HT-based CsPbI3 PSCs was largely enhanced with the Voc of 1.07 V and the FF of 0.73, and thus this results in the PCE of 16.76%. When the Ag electrode was replaced by Au, the PCE was further improved to 17.92% with the Voc of 1.10 V and the FF of 0.77, which is the highest in PCE for CsPbI3 PSCs with P3HT as the HTL reported to date. The high enhancement in PCE relative to the control device (15.51%) is mainly attributed to the reduced Voc loss of 60 mV and the enhanced FF from 0.72 to 0.77. Besides, the EuAc3 modification layer avoided the significant photocatalytic effect of TiO2 on CsPbI3 perovskite films,41 and the CsPbI3 PSCs demonstrated superior UV stability with 84% of the initial PCE under continuous UV irradiation for 250 h in a nitrogen filled glovebox, being obviously higher than the control devices with only 40% of the initial PCE after UV irradiation for 100 h in the same environment.
Results and discussion
The EuAc3 DMSO solution of various concentrations (0.25, 0.5, 0.75 and 1 mg mL−1) was spun on the surface of TiO2 films before spinning the CsPbI3 perovskite films. 0.5 mg mL−1 was found to be the optimal concentration by the characteristic of photovoltaic performance of PSCs (Fig. S1, ESI†). Therefore, in the following characterization, EuAc3 with the concentration of 0.5 mg mL−1 was used unless otherwise stated. X-Ray diffraction (XRD) was first used to estimate the crystalline structure and quality of the CsPbI3 perovskite film with the EuAc3 interface layer, as shown in Fig. 1a. Two main diffraction peaks around 2θ ≈ 14.2° and 28.6° can be assigned to the diffraction of the (110) and (220) crystal plane of β-CsPbI3.42–44 Compared with the control sample, the intensity of diffraction peaks enhanced for the samples with EuAc3. This indicates that EuAc3 spin-coated on the surface of TiO2 is beneficial to the crystallization of CsPbI3 perovskite films. Besides, no obvious shift is found in the XRD peak position when increasing the concentration of EuAc3 from 0 to 0.25, 0.5, 0.75 and 1 mg mL−1, indicating that the interface treatment by EuAc3 does not change the crystalline structure of the surface of CsPbI3 (Fig. S2, ESI†). In order to confirm the effect of EuAc3 on the bottom structure of the CsPbI3 film, we reduced the thickness of CsPbI3 perovskite films to ∼50 nm for the measurement of the XRD. The results indicate that the XRD peaks slightly shift to a higher 2θ value for the samples with the EuAc3 layer (Fig. S3, ESI†), meaning the contraction of the crystalline lattice. According to the previous report,40 Eu3+ (ionic radius: 94 pm) can replace the Pb2+ (ionic radius: 119 pm). Therefore, it is suggested that the replacement of Eu3+ with Pb2+ could occur in CsPbI3 near the TiO2/perovskite interface. In accord with the result of XRD, a slightly red-shift is observed in the UV-vis absorption spectra (Fig. 1b). The absorbance edge of the control film is located at ∼734 nm (∼1.69 eV), which is consistent with the absorbance edges of the previously reported pure β-CsPbI3.42 The corresponding Tauc plot shows a little diminution of the band gap when the CsPbI3 perovskite is treated with EuAc3 (Fig. 1c), and it could be ascribed to the contraction of the crystalline lattice due to the incorporation of a small amount of Eu ions into the crystalline lattice of the CsPbI3 perovskite.39 Besides, the absorption intensity of the EuAc3 treatment sample slightly improved in a visible light range, which could mainly result from the improvement in crystal quality of the CsPbI3 perovskite (see Fig. 1a). For another, the observed enhancement of absorption intensity may be also related to the down-conversion luminescence of EuAc3 (Fig. S4 and S5, ESI†).

X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) measurement was taken to investigate the interaction between EuAc3 and TiO2. The whole spectra are shown in Fig. S6, ESI.† For the sample with the EuAc3 layer, the significant peaks, as shown in Fig. 1d, are indexed to the Eu 3d orbital,38 but there are two valence europium ions of Eu2+ and Eu3+. The existence of Eu2+ is caused by the impurity of raw materials, which was further confirmed by the XPS spectra of EuAc3 powder (Fig. S7, ESI†). It was previously reported38 that Eu2+–Eu3+ as redox ion pairs could reduce the defects of Pb (Pb0) vacancy and I vacancy (I0), through redox reactions with Pb0 and I0. Fig. 1e shows the local high-resolution XPS spectra of the O 1s core level, where the two peaks are highlighted by deconvolution. The higher binding energy peak is related to the oxygen vacancy defects.45 This peak intensity is reduced without a peak-shift when EuAc3 was deposited (Fig. S8, ESI†), indicating that the oxygen vacancies reduce in the TiO2 film after the modification of EuAc3. The lower binding energy peak is attributed to the oxygen atoms, which boned with Ti2+ to form TiO2.45 Notably, this O 1s orbital and Ti 2p orbital (Fig. 1f) both shift to lower binding energy, which is probably due to the formation of new Ti–Ac coordination bonds that weaken original interaction between Ti2+ and O2−.40 Then, we prepared a thin perovskite film to investigate the chemical interaction between EuAc3 and perovskites through XPS spectra. As shown in Fig. S9, ESI,† except for a slight movement to higher binding energy in the Pb 4f orbital, there are no differences in Cs 3d and I 3d orbitals. It may be caused by the interaction between Pb and undercoordinated Ac−, which is another approach to reduce the Pb vacancy defect. The enhanced XPS signal of O 1s further confirmed the existence of Ac− in the CsPbI3 perovskite.40
As is well known, the compact and uniform surface morphology of ETL is critical for getting high quality perovskite films in n–i–p type PSCs. Fig. 2a and b show the Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) images of different TiO2 films. The Root-Mean-Square-Roughness (Rq) of the EuAc3 treated TiO2 film significantly decreases to 1.18 nm from 2.06 nm, implying that the surface of TiO2 becomes much smoother after spinning EuAc3, which is beneficial to the crystallization of the upper perovskite. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) with different magnifications was used to characterize the surface morphology of CsPbI3 perovskite films on different TiO2 substrates. Just as shown in Fig. 2c–f, the pristine CsPbI3 has a poor bumpy surface morphology with plenty of pinholes. These pinholes disappear entirely after the TiO2 film was modified by EuAc3, as a result, a compact, uniform and smooth perovskite film was obtained, which is attributed to the smooth TiO2 substrate with the EuAc3 modification layer (see Fig. 2b). Apart from that, the crystal grains size of the perovskite also becomes larger after EuAc3 treatment. We hypothesize that the homogenized TiO2 substrate would reduce perovskite nucleation sites so that larger crystal grains are obtained.

Furthermore, the steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and transient photoluminescence (TRPL) were applied to characterize the photophysical property of CsPbI3 perovskite films with and without EuAc3 treatment. Fig. 3a depicts the PL intensity of CsPbI3 films based on different TiO2 substrates, which were excited from the CsPbI3 film side. An increased PL intensity is observed when TiO2 was modified with EuAc3. It is known that the thickness of the perovskite film is generally 300–400 nm, while the laser penetration within the perovskite is about 100 nm.20 Therefore, the increased PL intensity should only be attributed to the improvement of crystal quality of the CsPbI3 perovskite film, which is related to the decreased non-radiative recombination from bulk defects. In order to get a deeper understanding on the defect passivation at the TiO2/perovskite interface, the steady PL tests in which the CsPbI3 films excited from the glass side were also performed as comparisons, as shown in Fig. S10a, ESI.† It is found that the CsPbI3 films prepared on EuAc3 also demonstrate an increase in PL intensity, in which the contribution from EuAc3 itself can be excluded (see Fig. S5, ESI†). Therefore, the logical explanation is that EuAc3 successfully passivated the interface defects of TiO2/CsPbI3, which can be further confirmed by the decreased difference of PL intensity after the introduction of EuAc3 (Fig. S10b, ESI†). Based on the above measurement, it is suggested that EuAc3 induces two positive effects: (1) the higher crystal quality of CsPbI3 perovskite films; (2) the decreased interface defects at the TiO2/perovskite interface. Therefore, the CsPbI3 films deposited on TiO2 substrates undergoing EuAc3 treatment have less bulk and interface defects, and thus result in reduced non-radiative recombination. In addition, the significant red-shift of the PL peak is observed for the EuAc3 modified sample relative to the control sample (Fig. S10a, ESI†), which should be attributed to the contraction of the crystalline lattice of the CsPbI3 perovskite, in keeping with the results of UV-vis spectra. The red-shift of the PL characteristic peak was also observed for the EuAc3 passivated sample depending on different excitation directions; see Fig. S10b, ESI,† which further certifies that only the perovskite lattices approaching the TiO2 interface are changed rather than the whole bulk structure of the perovskite. Then, the lifetime of charge carriers was analysed using TRPL, as shown in Fig. 3b and the corresponding lifetime parameters extracted by the biexponential fitting methods are shown in Table S1, ESI.† In general, the fast decay component τ1 is mainly affected by the trap-assistance non-radiative recombination, and the slow decay component τ2 is mainly correlated with the radiative recombination of free carriers.45 The value of τ1 and τ2 both increased after introducing EuAc3, which is consistent with PL intensity, suggesting that the trap densities are reduced, hence, the carrier lifetimes are prolonged. The increase in PL intensity and PL lifetime, which is caused by the reduction of trap-assistance nonradiative recombination, is very beneficial for improving the performance of PSCs.

To further confirm the role of the EuAc3 interlayer in the reduction of TiO2/perovskite interface defects and perovskite bulk defects, the trap-state density (Ntrap) was quantitatively calculated from trap-filled limit voltage (VTFL), which was obtained through the space-charge-limited-current (SCLC) test of electron-only devices with the structure of FTO/TiO2/EuAc3/perovskite/PCBM/Ag. The typical dark J–V curves of the electron-only devices are shown in Fig. 3b. The Ntrap is calculated through the equation of Ntrap = (2VTFLεε0)/(eL2), where VTFL is the trap filled limit voltage, ε is the relative dielectric constant of the CsPbI3 perovskite, ε0 is the vacuum dielectric constant, e is the charge of an electron, and L is the thickness of the CsPbI3 perovskite film.42 The values of VTFL of the devices without and with the EuAc3 interlayer are 1.11 and 0.68 V, respectively, and the corresponding Ntrap values are 1.15 × 1016 and 7.29 × 1015 cm−3. The reduction in trap density demonstrates that EuAc3 can passivate effectively the interface defects and reduce the perovskite bulk defects due to the better crystallization of CsPbI3 resulting from EuAc3. Furthermore, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis was applied to characterize the charge transport and recombination of different CsPbI3 PSCs without and with the EuAc3 interlayer. The EIS test was carried out at an applied bias of 0 V under dark conditions, as shown in Fig. 3d. The parameters of series resistance (Rs), charge transport resistance (Rct) and recombination resistance (Rrec) are determined by fitting the curves using an equivalent circuit, which is shown in Fig. 3d. All fitted parameters are listed in Table S2, ESI.†Rs represents the film resistance of the entire device, and there is no obvious difference between the control and modified device. The value of Rct reduced from 0.20 MΩ to 0.18 MΩ after inserting EuAc3, indicating that the charge transfer has been promoted. And in agreement with the results of PL and Ntrap values, the device with the EuAc3 modification layer has a larger Rrec of 10.94 MΩ, which is apparently higher than the Rrec of the control device (4.44 MΩ), illustrating that the trap-assistance recombination process in the EuAc3 based device is highly suppressed.
The optimized arrangement of energy level will also improve the performance of CsPbI3 PSCs, so ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) was adopted to evaluate the energetic alignment. Fig. 4a shows that work functions (WF) of TiO2 without and with EuAc3 treatment are −4.29 and −4.10 eV, respectively. The band gap of anatase TiO2 is reported to be 3.20 eV, so the conduction band minimum (CBM) of TiO2 was raised from −4.02 to −3.90 eV when the TiO2 film surface was modified by EuAc3. Moreover, the incorporation of Eu ions in the CsPbI3 perovskite crystal lattice also affects the energy level structure. For ensuring that the UPS data of the TiO2/perovskite interface are detectable, we prepared a thin CsPbI3 perovskite film with <50 nm thickness when modified by EuAc3. The UPS spectra (Fig. 4b) of CsPbI3 without and with the EuAc3 interlayer prove that the CBM of the CsPbI3 perovskite deposited on EuAc3 moves down with 0.10 eV. The energy diagram of the CsPbI3 PSC device is shown in Fig. 4c. Distinctly, the introduction of EuAc3 at the ETL/perovskite interface brings a better energy level alignment between TiO2 and CsPbI3 perovskite films, which is beneficial for charge separation and transport from CsPbI3 to TiO2. Then, we performed capacitance voltage (C2–V) measurement to understand the change of the built-in electric field of the CsPbI3 PSCs, which is obtained from the Mott–Schottky equation of C−2 = (2(Vbi − V))/(A2eεε0NA), where C is the capacitance under applied voltage V, Vbi is the built-in potential, A is the device area, ε is the relative dielectric constant of the CsPbI3 perovskite, ε0 is the vacuum dielectric constant, e is the charge of an electron, and NA is carrier concentration.46 The Vbi is closely related to the Voc. As shown in Fig. 4d, the Vbi of the EuAc3 modified CsPbI3 device is 0.79 V, which is about 0.08 V larger than the Vbi of the control device. This is due to the more matched energy levels caused by the EuAc3 interlayer, which provides an enhanced driving force to separate the photogenerated charge carriers as well as an extended depletion region to suppress electron–hole recombination at the interface, which eventually gives rise to higher Vbi and hence the better photovoltaic performance of the CsPbI3 PSCs.47

Based on the above analysis, the typical planar CsPbI3 PSC with the structure of FTO/TiO2/without and with EuAc3/CsPbI3/P3HT/Ag was fabricated, as shown in Fig. 5a. Among them, the TiO2 film deposited on the FTO glass is employed as the ETL, the CsPbI3 film as the light absorbing layer, the P3HT film as the HTL and the Ag coating as the top anode. EuAc3 is selected as an interface modification layer. The current–voltage (J–V) curves for CsPbI3 PSCs are presented in Fig. 5b, and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters based on 30 devices are listed in Table 1, where the parameters of the champion device are also listed in parentheses and the box charts of four parameters are shown in Fig. S11, ESI.† Indeed, EuAc3 based CsPbI3 PSCs show better reproducibility and higher photovoltaic performance (Fig. 5b and c). The control device exhibited an average PCE of 14.51%, with an average Voc of 0.98 V, an average Jsc of 21.10 mA cm−2, and an average FF of 0.70. When EuAc3 is inserted into the TiO2/perovskite interface, the Jsc increased slightly, which is due to better crystallinity and improved absorbance at the visible region (Fig. 1). Fundamentally, the enhanced performance is mainly derived from an increase in the Voc and FF, and the CsPbI3 PSC with the EuAc3 interlayer possesses an optimal average PCE of 16.06%, accompanied with an average Voc of 1.04 V, an average Jsc of 21.34 mA cm−2 and an average FF of 0.73. The energy loss in CsPbI3 PSCs is effectively reduced. The champion device exhibits the highest PCE of 16.76%, with a Voc of 1.07 V, a Jsc of 21.30 mA cm−2 and an FF of 0.73. When Ag electrodes were replaced by Au (see Fig. 5d), the PCE of CsPbI3 PSCs is further improved to 17.92%, which is the highest PCE of P3HT based CsPbI3 PSCs ever reported, as shown in Table S3 (ESI†).

Fig. 5e shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the corresponding CsPbI3 PSCs with and without the EuAc3 interlayer. The integrated Jsc values obtained from EQE spectra of CsPbI3 PSCs without and with EuAc3 treatment are 20.01 and 20.30 mA cm−2, respectively. The value is within a 5% deviation from Jsc obtained from J–V measurement. The stabilized power output of the device without and with the EuAc3 interlayer is shown in Fig. 5f. Appling an external bias at the maximum power output point of 0.89 V, the proposed CsPbI3 PSC device represents a stabilized photocurrent of 18.12 mA cm−2, corresponding a stabilized efficiency of 16.03%, while the control device shows an evident decline in photocurrent and efficiency at the maximum power output point. In addition, the reverse and forward scanned J–V curves of the control and EuAc3 modified CsPbI3 PSCs were compared. The hysteresis index (HI), which is estimated through the equation of HI = (PCEreverse − PCEforward)/PCEreverse,40 obviously decreased from 4.77% to 3.35% after modifying with EuAc3 (Fig. S11, ESI†). The reduced hysteresis effect is related to the fast charge transfer and the decreased trap-assistance recombination, corresponding with the results of EIS.
Next, the stability of CsPbI3 PSCs under the UV light condition was characterized. First of all, the transmittance of TiO2 without and with the EuAc3 coating was characterized, as shown in Fig. S13, ESI.† There is an evident decline in transmittance around 365 nm for the EuAc3 modified TiO2 film, indicating that the inserted EuAc3 can reduce the transmission of ultraviolet light, which is beneficial to the stability of PSCs under long-time working. Fig. 6a–d show the normalized graphs of the photovoltaic parameter (PCE, Voc, FF and Jsc) to investigate the UV stability of different CsPbI3 PSCs with and without the EuAc3 interlayer under UV illumination with the power density of 4 mW cm−2, and the pictures of the corresponding device working over several days are embedded in the normalized PCE plot. All measurements were performed in the glove box. Apparently, the PCE of the CsPbI3 PSC modified by EuAc3 still maintains 84% of its initial value over 250 h under UV irradiation, but the PCE of the control device dropped to only 40% of initial efficiency after UV irradiation for 100 h. The inline pictures also express a significant decomposition of the control CsPbI3 PSC when testing for 7 days under simulated light conditions; in contrast, there is no obvious change in the EuAc3-based CsPbI3 film after 10 days of measurement. Finally, Fig. S13, ESI† exhibits the evolution process of exposure of different CsPbI3 films to UV light with the irradiation intensity of about 4 mW cm−2 at 365 nm in the glove box. It is visualized that UV stability of the CsPbI3 perovskite film enhanced after inserting EuAc3 into the interface of the TiO2/perovskite.

Conclusion
In this work, EuAc3 as a multifunction interface material was selected to modify the TiO2/perovskite interface for high efficiency and stability CsPbI3 PSCs based on P3HT as HTL. The results show that the modified TiO2 by EuAc3 is a better substrate for getting high crystallinity, uniform and pinhole-free CsPbI3 perovskite films. Both bulk and interfacial defects are reduced effectively, and hence the nonradiative recombination is suppressed. Meanwhile, the energy level arrangement between TiO2 and CsPbI3 perovskites is optimized and the built-in electric field is improved, which afford a strength force to accelerate the separation and transfer of charge carriers from the CsPbI3 perovskite to TiO2. Therefore, the enhanced performance of EuAc3-based CsPbI3 PSCs is obtained with the Voc of 1.07 V and the FF of 0.73, and then the PCE of 16.76%. When the Ag electrode was replaced with Au, the PCE further improves to 17.92% with the Voc of 1.10 V and the FF of 0.77, which is a record for CsPbI3 PSCs with P3HT as the HTL. Besides, the CsPbI3 PSC with the EuAc3 modification layer demonstrates superior UV stability with 84% of the initial PCE under continuous UV irradiation for 250 h in a nitrogen filled glovebox, which is obviously higher than the control devices with only 40% of the initial PCE after UV irradiation for 100 h in the same environment.
Experimental section
Materials
Ti(IV) bis(ethyl acetoacetate)-diisopropoxide was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Cesium iodide (CsI; 99.99%) and HPbI3 were purchased from from Xi’an Polymer Light Technology Corporation. N,N-Dimethylformamide (DMF, 99.8%), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, 99.9%), chlorobenzene (CB; 99.8%) and europium acetate (EuAc3, 99.99%) were purchased from Aldrich.
Device fabrication
The inorganic CsPbI3 PSCs were fabricated with a structure of FTO/TiO2 with and without EuAc3/CsPbI3/P3HT/Ag. FTO glass substrates were cleaned with distilled water, acetone and isopropanol in an ultrasonic bath for 15 min, respectively. TiO2 films as the electron transport layer (ETL) were prepared by spin-coating a 0.2 M Ti(IV) bis(ethyl acetoacetate)-diisopropoxide solution in 1-butanol on FTO glass at 3000 rpm for 30 s, and is then annealed at 450 °C in muffle furnace for 60 min with a heating rate of 2 °C s−1. For the EuAc3 modified sample, EuAc3 was dissolved in DMSO with different concentrations, and was then spin-coated on TiO2 films at 6000 rpm for 20 s, followed by annealing at 70 °C for 1 min. The 0.6 M CsPbI3 perovskite precursor was prepared by dissolving 0.156 g CsI and 0.353 g HPbI3 in 1 mL DMF, then the CsPbI3 precursor were spin-coated on the TiO2 film (or with EuAc3 coating) at 3000 rpm for 30 s. After that, the CsPbI3 precursor film was heated at 180 °C for 15 min to obtain black CsPbI3 films. The hole transport layer was prepared by spin-coating the P3HT solution with the concentration of 10 mg mL−1 in CB at 4000 rpm for 40 s, followed by annealing at 120 °C for 2 min. Finally, the Ag or Au layer (≈100 nm) was thermally evaporated as the top electrode using a shadow mask to form a device with the active area of 0.04 cm2.
Device characterization
XRD measurement was performed on a D/MAX 2400 diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (Rigaku). The absorption spectra and transmission spectra were measured by using a UV-vis NIR spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer, Lambda 950). PL (excitation at 475 nm) spectra were measured using a FLS980 spectrometer (Edinburgh Instruments Ltd) and TRPL spectra were recorded with PicoQuant FluoQuant 300. Top-view SEM images were obtained by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM, HITACHI, SU-8020). XPS was carried out by a photoelectron spectrometer (ESCALAB250Xi, Thermo Fisher Scientific). The J–V measurements of PSCs were performed on the Keithley 2400 source under the illumination of an AM 1.5G with 100 mW cm−2 irradiance generated by a SAN-EI ELECTRIC XES-40S2-CE solar simulator, with the intensity calibrated by a NREL-traceable KG5 filtered silicon reference cell. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) of PSCs was recorded by using a QTest Station 2000 ADI system (Crowntech Inc.).
