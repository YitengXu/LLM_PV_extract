    , Accepted 29th March 2015First published on 31st March 2015AbstractThe anomalous upconversion (UC) emission of the electric dipole transition 5D0 → 7F4 of Eu3+ ions at ∼690 nm can be tailored by a 976 nm laser beam in Sr2Ca(W,Mo)O6:Yb3+,Eu3+ samples at various pumping powers or temperatures, while the intensity ratio of the magnetic transition 5D0 → 7F1 at ∼594 nm to the electric dipole transition 5D0 → 7F2 at ∼612 nm barely changes. This is most probably attributed to the electronic polarization effect of the host materials with Mo on the electric dipole transition 5D0 → 7F4, which is proved by the larger dielectric permittivity of Sr2CaMoO6 compared to Sr2CaWO6 (108 Hz), according to the alternating current (AC) impedance spectroscopy measurements and further evidenced by theoretical calculations of the dielectric function at high frequency (∼1014 Hz of the 976 nm laser light). The research gives an unusual perspective to tailoring the UC behavior of lanthanide ions through the electric field of a laser beam itself besides approaches of applying an external electric field, varying the chemical compositions, using different co-dopants, etc., which might be inspiring for the design of opto-electric multifunctional devices.
1. Introduction
Tailoring the UC emission of lanthanide ions is of great importance and is imperative for various applications, such as opto-electric multifunctional devices, optical temperature sensors, displays, optical amplifiers, solar cells, biomolecule labels, and so on.1–7 Normally, there are several approaches for tailoring the UC behavior, e.g. via varying the chemical compositions of the host materials or activator ions,7,8 constructing core–shell nanostructures,3 or employing sensitizers like dyes,9 noble metals,10 other lanthanide ions like Nd3+,11 transition metal ions,12,13etc. Applying an external electric field to lanthanide ion doped material layers is another effective way to tune the UC behavior as the electric dipole transitions of lanthanide ions can be strongly affected by an electric field.14 Since laser light is a type of electromagnetic wave with both an electric vector and a magnetic vector, it can not only excite an electron from the ground state to the excited state but it can also induce electronic polarization of the crystal lattice around lanthanide ions. It has been reported in previous work that intense laser light could make a contribution to the polarization in the semiconductor quantum well,15,16 according to experiments and theoretical calculations. For instance, the effect of a high-frequency laser field on the subband structure and polarizabilities of shallow donors in a GaAs/GaAlAs inverse V-shaped quantum well for different Al concentrations at a structure center has been studied.16 It was found that the change in the quantum well potential shape induced by the variable laser field intensity was similar to the variation in the Al concentration at the structure center, which means that the external electric field of the laser acts like an internal electric field induced by the variation of Al. Thus, a laser field may be another way to tailor the UC emission of lanthanide ions. It was recently reported that the abnormal site-dependent UC emission of Eu3+ in Sr2Ca(W,Mo)O6:Yb3+,Eu3+ was caused by a laser.17 However, no specific research on the polarization effect for tailoring the UC behavior and no further evidence have been reported so far. Thus, this contribution will first illustrate the tailoring phenomenon of the Eu3+ UC emission by a laser and make an attempt to give an insight into the polarization effects experimentally and theoretically. It is known that the dielectric permittivity at high frequency (∼1014 Hz for near infrared light) corresponds to the capacity of electronic polarization. Therefore, AC impedance spectroscopy and theoretical extrapolation in the electronic structure via density functional theory (DFT) calculations18 are utilized to describe the dielectric properties.
2. Experimental
The UC Sr2Ca0.88Eu0.02Yb0.04Li0.06Mo1−xWxO6 materials were synthesized according to our previous work.17 Typically, stoichiometric amounts of SrCO3 (analytical reagent, A.R.), CaCO3 (A.R.), MoO3 (A.R.), WO3 (A.R.), Li2CO3 (A.R.), Yb2O3 (99.99%) and Eu2O3 (99.99%) were mixed thoroughly in an agate mortar. Li2CO3 was used as a charge compensator. The mixture was first calcined at 600 °C for 5 h, then at 1000 °C for 5 h, and finally at 1150 °C for 20 h, with several intermediate grindings. Sintered ceramics were prepared using the intermediate mixture powders as precursors, in which the raw materials were presintered at 600 °C for 5 h, then at 1000 °C for 5 h in air, with intermediate grinding. Then the precursors were thoroughly mixed with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) (5 wt%) binder solution and then pressed under 20 MPa pressure into pellets.1,19 Finally, the pellets were sintered at 1150 °C for 20 h in air. The sintered ceramic pellets were ∼1 mm in thickness and ∼10 mm in diameter.
The phase purity of the ceramics was identified by using a powder X-ray diffractometer (XRD) (Philips PW1830) with a graphite monochromator and Cu Kα irradiation. The step scan mode was used with a setup of 40 kV × 40 mA, 0.01° per step and 0.2 s per step. Rietveld refinement of XRD data was performed by using the TOPAS-Academic program. UC emission spectra and Stokes luminescence spectra were recorded on a JOBIN YVON TRIAX 320 spectrofluorometer equipped with a R928 photomultiplier tube as the detector. The light sources were a 976 nm laser diode (LD, Coherent Corp.) for the former measurements and a 450 W xenon lamp for the latter measurements. The temperature-dependent UC emission spectra were measured using the same spectrofluorometer equipped with a TAP-02 high-temperature fluorescence accessory (Tian Jin Orient-KOJI instrument Co., Ltd, China). The dielectric permittivities of the ceramics were measured using an Agilent 4294A Precision Impedance Analyzer from 40 Hz to 110 MHz connected to a computer. Prior to this measurement, a silver slurry was pasted on both sides of the ceramic pellets and heated at 600 °C for 20 min in air in order to get the electrodes.20
The calculations were performed using the density functional theory plane-wave pseudopotential method,21 implemented using the CASTEP code (Cambridge Serial Total Energy Package, Accelrys Inc.) in the Materials Studio.22 The exchange–correlation potentials employed were the local density approximation (LDA) with the Ceperley–Alder form.23 The convergence criteria for the structure optimizations and energy calculations were set to be ultrafine quality with a 650 eV cutoff and a 4 × 4 × 3 Monkhorst–Pack24k-point mesh with a (−1/8, −1/8, 0) shift to include the Γ point for both Sr2CaMoO6 and Sr2CaWO6. Before the single point energy calculations, geometry optimizations were carried out according to the initial models generated from the Rietveld refinement results (without dopants), and the self-consistent convergence accuracy was set at 5.0 × 10−6 eV per atom. The convergence criterion for the maximal force on the atoms was 0.01 eV Å−1 and the maximum displacement was 5.0 × 10−4 Å. These conditions were applied to calculate the related electronic band structure, density of states (DOS) and the optical properties (dielectric function).
The frequency-dependent dielectric function ε(ω) is used to describe the optical response of a medium at all photon energies. There are two types of contributions, intraband and interband transitions, to the dielectric function. The main contribution to the dielectric function comes from the interband transitions, which can be separated into direct and indirect transitions. The premeditated direct interband contribution to the imaginary part of the dielectric function is computed by summing the transitions from the occupied to the unoccupied states (with fixed k) over the Brillouin zone, weighted with the suitable matrix elements referring to the chance for the transition.18,25 The imaginary part of the dielectric function ε2(ω) can be given by:18,25 (1)where e and m are the electron charge and mass, respectively, ω and V are the frequency of the incoming electromagnetic radiation and the volume of the unit cell, respectively, and (px, py, pz) = p is the momentum operator. The crystal wave function |knσ〉 corresponds to eigenvalue Ekn with crystal momentum k and spin σ. fkn is the Fermi distribution function, ensuring that only transitions from occupied to unoccupied states are counted, and σ(Ekn′ − Ekn − ℏω) is the condition for total energy conversion. The real part of the dielectric function ε1(ω) can be obtained from ε2(ω) using the Kramers–Kronig dispersion relation:18,26 (2)
3. Results and discussion
3.1 XRD patterns
The nominal compositions in Sr2Ca0.88Eu0.02Yb0.04Li0.06Mo1−xWxO6 are simplified as SCEYM1−xWxO for clarity. The XRD patterns of the SCEYM1−xWxO powder samples are analogous with previous results,17,27–29 which proved that they could form a complete solid solution. The XRD patterns of the ceramic pellet samples shown in Fig. 1 also agree well with the JCPDS 81-1432 data or JCPDS 76-1983 data, except for a few minor impurity peaks ((Sr,Ca)MoO4 for the SCEYMO sample), which are also common in previous work and are difficult to eliminate.17,30 Owing to the more easy evaporation of MoO3 compared to WO3 at high temperatures, we failed to get condensed single-phased ceramic pellets of the SCEYM1−xWxO solution samples. Rietveld refinement results of the XRD patterns of the SCEYMO and SCEYWO ceramic pellets are given in Fig. 2, and Tables 1 and 2. The lattices of SCEYMO and SCEYWO have monoclinic and orthorhombic symmetry with space groups of P21/n and Pmm2, respectively. The SCEYM1−xWxO samples possess a double perovskite structure with a 1:1 ordered B-site cation (Ca/Mo/W) arrangement.17,30 An A site cation (Sr) is 12-coordinated by oxygen, while a B site cation (Ca/Mo/W) is 6-coordinated. The linkage of the BO6 (B = Ca/Mo/W) octahedra is tilted from the ideal perovskite structure.

3.2 Tailored UC behaviour

Fig. 3(a) and (b) show the emission spectra of the SCEYM1−xWxO powder samples under UV light and 976 nm laser, respectively. As presented in these spectra, the peaks at ∼594 nm are assigned to the magnetic dipole transition 5D0 → 7F1 of Eu3+ ions in the Ca2+ sites with symmetric centers, while the peaks at ∼612 nm are due to the electric dipole transition 5D0 → 7F2 of Eu3+ ions in the Sr2+ sites with non-symmetric centers.17,27,29,31,32 The broad peaks around 670–720 nm can be ascribed to the Stark splitting of 5D0 → 7F4 of Eu3+ ions in Sr2+ sites. Chan et al. argued that this peak originated from Mn4+ ions introduced by the MoO3 raw material.33 Following their experiment, we synthesized some samples doped with Mn4+ but without Mo in SCEYWO. The XRD patterns, UC spectra as well as photographs of these samples are illustrated in the ESI† (Fig. S1 and S2). These distinctly show that the peaks at ∼690 nm should not be ascribed to the Mn4+ ion. The differences in the intensity ratio of the 5D0 → 7F1 to 5D0 → 7F2 peaks are probably due to the different energy transfer efficiencies from the MoO6 groups to Eu3+ for the Stokes luminescence and from Yb3+ to Eu3+ for the UC luminescence.17,29 As seen in Fig. 3, a notable abnormal 5D0 → 7F4 luminescence is observed for the samples with Mo when excited by a 976 nm laser beam. This emission peak is almost absent for the samples with and without Mo upon excitation with UV light and for the sample without Mo upon excitation with a 976 nm laser beam. Thus we can conclude that the 976 nm laser beam, together with the hosts with Mo, has an effect on this anomalous forced electric dipole transition of 5D0 → 7F4.
 Fig. 3  Emission spectra of the SCEYM1−xWxO powder samples under excitation with (a) 360 nm ultraviolet light (280 nm for SCEYWO) and (b) a 976 nm laser beam with a pumping power of ∼20 W cm−2. 
To further understand the abnormal 5D0 → 7F4 transition in this system, the experimental effects of various pumping powers and temperatures on this 5D0 → 7F4 transition were conducted and the spectra are illustrated in Fig. 4, all of which are normalized for the peaks at ∼612 nm. As seen in Fig. 4, the intensity ratios of the magnetic dipole transition 5D0 → 7F1 to the electric dipole transition 5D0 → 7F2 barely changes for all the samples whether at different pumping powers or at various temperatures. This suggests consistency of the coordination environment (site symmetry) for the Eu3+ sites in these samples owing to the sensitive probe of the Eu3+ ion. However, the electric dipole transition 5D0 → 7F4 shows an apparent variation for the samples with Mo, especially at different temperatures, which implies a dynamic variety in the electron cloud environment around the Eu3+ ions other than a change in the Eu3+ site symmetry. This also proves the conclusion that the 5D0 → 7F4 transition is dominated by a ligand polarizability-dependent dynamic coupling mechanism according to the Judd–Ofelt theory, as presented in previous work.17 According to Fig. 3 and 4, the dramatic change in the 5D0 → 7F4 transition is primarily ascribed to the laser light stimulation for samples with Mo.17 Since the electric field E of the 976 nm laser beam (about ∼1014 Hz) could only cause electronic polarization, and dielectric permittivity is one of the measurements of electronic polarization, AC impedance data of the ceramic pellets were measured.

3.3 Dielectric permittivity

Fig. 5 shows the dielectric permittivity of the SCEYMO and SCEYWO ceramic pellets as a function of frequency, according to the AC impedance measurements. It can be found that the dielectric permittivity of SCEYMO is always larger than that of SCEYWO over the frequency range of 105–108 Hz. At about ∼108 Hz, the dielectric permittivities are around 20 and 7 for SCEYMO and SCEYWO, respectively, and contain contributions from both electronic and ionic polarizations.34 It can be concluded that the electronic and ionic polarization effects are larger for SCEYMO than for SCEYWO. However, the frequency of the 976 nm near-infrared light is ∼1014 Hz and only the electronic polarization works when the SCEYMO and SCEYWO samples are stimulated by the 976 nm laser light. Thus, theoretical calculations of the electronic band structure, DOS and optical properties were performed to attempt to investigate the contribution of electronic polarization for these two samples.

3.4 Calculated electronic structure and optical properties
In order to simplify the calculations, undoped hosts of SCMO and SCWO were used as models in the calculations because the dopant amounts of Yb3+ and Eu3+ ions are small and the polarization effect on Eu3+ at high frequency should mostly be due to the hosts. Fig. 6 shows the electronic band structures and DOS of SCMO and SCWO. According to the orbital population analysis, the main contribution to the valence bands of both compounds comes from the O 2p orbitals, and the first excitation bands are mostly contributions from the Mo 4d or W 5d orbitals.28,35 As seen in Fig. 6, SCMO and SCWO are indirect band gap materials, and the band gap energies for SCMO and SCWO were calculated to be 2.14 eV and 3.01 eV, respectively.
 Fig. 6  Diagrams of the electronic band structures and partial density states of Mo/W/O/Ca/Sr for SCMO (a, b) and SCWO (c, d). Indirect band gap energies of SCMO and SCWO are predicted to be 2.14 eV and 3.01 eV, respectively. 
The calculated dielectric function ε(ω) in Fig. 7 describes the optical response of the hosts at all photon energies. It includes the calculated imaginary and real parts of the dielectric function for compounds SCMO and SCWO as a function of the photon energy from 0 eV to 15 eV. The dielectric peaks are mostly contributions from the interband transitions for photon energies larger than 2 eV. Near the 0 eV point, the real part value of the dielectric function is considered as the intrinsic polarization of the electrons in the hosts, which could also be taken as the dielectric response when materials are stimulated at a high frequency, such as with 976 nm near infrared laser light (1014 Hz). The dielectric permittivities are 3.45 and 2.87 for SCMO and SCWO, respectively, near the 0 eV point, which suggests the electronic polarization of SCMO is larger than that of SCWO. This can probably interpret the tailoring behavior of the 5D0 → 7F4 transition of Eu3+, which is governed by a ligand polarizability-dependent dynamic coupling mechanism.

4. Conclusions
In conclusion, the tailored UC emission of the 5D0 → 7F4 transition of Eu3+ ions has been reported in the double perovskite SCEYM1−xWxO samples when excited by a 976 nm laser beam. AC impedance spectroscopy data and theoretical optical property calculations reveal that SCMO has a larger electronic polarization than SCWO under excitation with a 976 nm laser beam. This shows that the tailoring behavior of the 5D0 → 7F4 transition is governed by an electronic polarization mechanism according to a previously reported ligand polarizability-dependent dynamic coupling mechanism. This research offers a new approach via a laser electric field to tailor the UC luminescence of lanthanide ions, which is potentially applicable for the design of opto-electric multifunctional devices.
