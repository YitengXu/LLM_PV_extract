    , Accepted 9th September 2016First published on 9th September 2016AbstractTwo kinds of electroactive polyamides with bis(diphenylamino)-fluorene units acting as electroactive fluorophores were prepared via condensation polymerization from a novel diamine, N,N′-bis(4-aminophenyl)-N,N′-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)-2,7-diamino-9,9-dimethylfluorene, with cycloaliphatic and aromatic dicarboxylic acids, respectively. These polyamides exhibited excellent solubility in various organic solvents and outstanding thermal stability. Cyclic voltammograms of the polyamide films revealed two reversible redox couples with half-wave potentials at 0.54–0.56 and 0.75–0.78 V, respectively. The polyamide films showed excellent reversible stability of multicolor electrochromic characteristics (colorless-orange-blue) after over 1000 cyclic switches. Compared with the polyamide derived from aromatic dicarboxylic acids, the polyamide derived from cycloaliphatic dicarboxylic acid exhibited strong fluorescence with quantum yield up to 50.2%. Furthermore, the fluorescence could be reversibly modulated by electrochemical redox with superior stability and a high contrast ratio of 152.
Introduction
Recently, stimuli-responsive fluorescence materials have attracted great interest owing to their promising applications in bio-analysis, sensors and displays.1–7 Specially, fluorescence materials modulated by electrical triggers are receiving more and more attention as the electrical stimuli could be applied reversibly, rapidly and remotely.8 Since the first example of electrofluorescent materials reported by Lehn in 1993,9 several such materials have been developed and they mainly comprise dyads,10,11 conjugated polymers12,13 and electroactive fluorophores.14–16 Compared with the other two types, the electroactive fluorophores are more fascinating because their fluorescence could be directly switched by electrochemical conversion to their corresponding ion-radicals. While the electrofluorescent materials still remain at the laboratory research stage, the electrochromic materials have been successfully commercialized in the fields of smart windows and displays.17,18 Definitely, electrochromic materials exhibit reversible changes in absorption upon electrochemical oxidation and reduction. Therefore, the electrochromic displays essentially rely on a front/back light when used under dark conditions. To realize high visibility in either a bright or a dark environment, dual-mode displays with both tunable coloration and emission will be promising candidates, which could be obtained by combining electrochromism and electrofluorescence technologies. Up to now, a few examples of dual-switching materials have been reported including transition-metal complexes, organic molecules and electroactive polymers;19–23 among them, phenylamine-based polymers have developed rapidly because of their facile processability as solid-state electro-switchable devices.24,25 However, most of the emerged materials usually lack long-term stability, rapid response time or high-contrast of optical response. For better satisfaction of future applications, more versatile materials with dual-switching of coloration and emission need to be further exploited.
Triphenylamine derivatives have been widely investigated and applied in various electro-optical materials such as dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs), memories and electrochromism devices.26–33 Most of these applications stem from the lone pair electrons of nitrogen, which could be easily oxidized to its cation radicals. In particular, it was found that the triphenylamine derivatives with methoxy groups substituted at the para-position exhibited lower oxidation potential and superiorly stable electroactivity, which remained up to 90% after 10000 switching cycles.34–36 Thus, 4-methoxy triphenylamine could readily act as an effective modulator in electro-switching systems. Due to the poor fluorescence essence of triphenylamine, more fluorene-triphenylamine derivatives have been designed and synthesized, whose strong fluorescence demonstrates their potential as blue light-emitting materials.37–39 Accordingly, the fluorophores consisting of triphenylamine and fluorene are promising for dual-switching coloration/emission materials. Recently, we have reported a series of polyamides with diphenylamine-fluorene units which exhibited attractive electrochromic and electrofluorescent properties.40 However, their high oxidation potentials and the moderate switching stabilities greatly restrict their practical applications. Therefore, exploring a molecular-design strategy for introducing electron-donating methoxy groups at the para-position of triphenylamine to reduce the oxidation potentials and increase the electro-switching stabilities of the resulting polyamides will be a feasible way.
In this contribution, we herein describe a new diamine monomer, N,N′-bis(4-aminophenyl)-N,N′-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)-2,7-diamino-9,9-dimethylfluorene, and its facile incorporation into polymer backbones, yielding novel electroactive polyamides. The introduction of electron-donating methoxy substituents is expected to reduce the oxidation potential associated with enhanced electrochemical stability of the resulting polyamides. We anticipate that the semi-aromatic polyamide will exhibit electrochromic/electrofluorescent dual-switching behaviors with a low trigger voltage and high stability.   
Experimental
Materials
2,7-Dibromo-9,9-dimethylfluorene (TCI), 4-methoxyaniline (TCI), 4-fluoronitrobenzene (Acros), 18-crown-6 ether (TCI), potassium carbonate (TCI), triethylamine (Acros), 10% palladium on charcoal (Pd/C, TCI) and hydrazine monohydrate (TCI) were used as received. o-Dichlorobenzene (TCI) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) were purified by vacuum distillation over CaH2 and stored over 4 Å molecular sieves prior to use. Commercially available dicarboxylic acids that include trans-1,4-cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid (4a, TCI) and terephthalic acid (4b, TCI) were dried under vacuum at 100 °C prior to use. Calcium chloride was dried under vacuum at 180 °C for 12 h prior to use. Tetrabutylammonium perchlorate (TBAP, Acros) was recrystallized twice from ethanol under a nitrogen atmosphere and then dried under vacuum before use. Other commercially available reagents and chemicals were used without further purification.
Monomer synthesis

4-Methoxy-4′-nitrodiphenylamine (1). 
4-Methoxy-4′-nitrodiphenylamine was synthesized based on the literature procedure with some modifications. In a 500 mL three-neck round-bottom flask, a mixture of 48 g (390 mmol) 4-methoxyaniline, 42.3 g (300 mmol) 4-fluoronitrobenzene, 39.7 g (390 mmol) triethylamine and 300 mL DMSO was heated at 90 °C for 24 h. After cooling to room temperature, the mixture was poured into water with stirring to afford orange powder. The crude product was then recrystallized by DMSO/ethanol (1:3) to give orange needle-like crystals (78.4% of yield, mp = 156 °C, literature41 153 °C by DSC at 10 °C min−1). 1H NMR (300 MHz, DMSO-d6, δ, ppm): 9.12 (s, 1H), 8.05 (d, J = 9.3 Hz, 2H), 7.18 (d, J = 8.9 Hz, 2H), 6.98 (d, J = 8.9 Hz, 2H), 6.88 (d, J = 9.3 Hz, 2H), 3.76 (s, 3H).


N,N′-Bis(4-nitrophenyl)-N,N′-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)-2,7-diamino-9,9-dimethylfluorene (2)
In a 250 mL three-neck round-bottom flask, 9 g (25.6 mmol) of 2,7-dibromo-9,9-dimethylfluorene, 16.2 g (33.3 mmol) 4-methoxy-4′-nitrodiphenylamine, 28.1 g (204.6 mmol) potassium carbonate, 3.4 g (12.6 mmol) 18-crown-6 ether and 6.6 g (103.1 mmol) copper powder were dispersed in 120 mL o-dichlorobenzene, and stirred at 165 °C under nitrogen for 30 h. The inorganic salts and copper powder were then filtered from the hot reaction mixture. The filtrate cooled to precipitate yellow crystals after being added to about 80 mL of ethanol. The yellow crystal was purified by recrystallizing from DMF/ethanol, yielding 10.2 g of the pure dinitro compound in 58.3% with a melting point of 141 °C. IR (KBr): 1311 cm−1, 1579 cm−1 (–NO2 stretch). 1H NMR (300 MHz, DMSO-d6, δ, ppm): 8.06 (d, J = 9.4 Hz, 4H), 7.87 (d, J = 8.1 Hz, 2H), 7.53 (d, J = 2.0 Hz, 2H), 7.31 (d, J = 8.8 Hz, 4H), 7.25 (dd, J = 8.1, 2.0 Hz, 2H), 7.06 (d, J = 8.9 Hz, 4H), 6.74 (d, J = 9.4 Hz, 4H), 3.79 (s, 6H), 1.39 (s, 6H).


N,N′-Bis(4-aminophenyl)-N,N′-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)-2,7-diamino-9,9-dimethylfluorene (3). 
In a 500 mL three-neck round-bottom flask, 6 g (8.8 mmol) of the dinitro compound 2 and 1 g of Pd/C were dispersed in 70 mL of dioxane. After heating the mixture to reflux, 8.4 g hydrazine monohydrate was slowly added into it. Then the mixture was stirred at the reflux temperature for 24 h. The Pd/C was removed by filtration and the resulting filtrate was poured into water. The precipitated crude was collected and purified by silica gel column chromatography, using dichloromethane as an eluent. 3.9 g of the product was obtained as a green powder in a 70.9% yield. 1H NMR (300 MHz, DMSO-d6, δ, ppm): 7.38 (d, J = 8.3 Hz, 2H, Hg), 6.97 (d, J = 9.0 Hz, 4H, Hc), 6.86 (m, 6H, Hd + He), 6.81 (d, J = 8.6 Hz, 4H, Hb), 6.64 (dd, J = 8.3, 2.1 Hz, 2H, Hf), 6.55 (d, J = 8.6 Hz, 4H, Ha), 5.02 (s, 4H, –NH2), 3.72 (s, 6H, –OCH3), 1.19 (s, 6H, –CH3). 13C NMR (75 MHz, DMSO-d6, δ, ppm): 154.78 (C8), 153.76 (C1), 147.41 (C9), 145.56 (C4), 141.03 (C5), 136.03 (C12), 130.80 (C13), 127.23 (C3), 125.21 (C6), 119.31 (C11), 118.26 (C14), 114.88 (C2), 114.60 (C7), 113.37 (C10), 55.14 (–OCH3), 45.92 (C15), 27.07 (–CH3).

Polymer synthesis
Two polyamides were prepared via condensation polymerization (as shown in Scheme 2). The prepared polyamides were abbreviated as 5a, 5b, respectively. In a typical procedure, a mixture of 0.618 g (1 mmol) of the diamine monomer 3, 0.172 g (1 mmol) of 4a, 0.12 g of calcium chloride, 1 mL of triphenyl phosphite, 0.5 mL of pyridine, and 2.5 mL of NMP were heated with stirring at 110 °C for 3 h. After cooling to room temperature, the obtained viscous polymer solution was poured slowly into 250 mL of methanol, producing a stringy, fiber-like precipitate. The resulting polymer was washed thoroughly with hot water and methanol, and then reprecipitated by using DMAc/ethanol twice for further purification. The 1H NMR data of these polyamides are listed as follows.

Polyamide 5a. 

1H NMR (300 MHz, DMSO-d6, δ, ppm): 9.82 (s, 2H, amide-NH), 7.58–7.41 (m, 6H, Ha + Hg), 7.05–6.96 (m, 6H, Hc + He), 6.96–6.84 (m, 8H, Hd + Hb), 6.77 (d, J = 8.4 Hz, 2H, Hf), 3.73 (s, 6H, –OCH3), 2.42–2.21 (m, 2H, Hh), 1.99–1.78 (m, 4H, Hi), 1.58–1.37 (m, 4H, Hi), 1.23 (s, 6H, –CH3).


Polyamide 5b. 

1H NMR (300 MHz, DMSO-d6, δ, ppm): 10.33 (s, 2H, amide-NH), 8.08 (s, 4H, Hh), 7.71 (d, J = 8.6 Hz, 4H, Ha), 7.54 (d, J = 8.5 Hz, 2H, Hg), 7.10–7.02 (m, 6H, Hc + He), 7.00 (d, J = 8.9 Hz, 4H, Hd), 6.93 (d, J = 8.5 Hz, 4H, Hb), 6.84 (d, J = 8.4 Hz, 2H, Hf), 3.75 (s, 6H, –OCH3), 1.27 (s, 6H, –CH3).
The polyamide films were prepared as follows. A solution of the polyamide was obtained by dissolving about 0.3 g of the sample in 6 mL of DMAc. The homogeneous solution was then poured into a 6 cm glass Petri dish, which was placed in the oven at 90 °C for 10 h to release the solvent slowly. After that, the damp-dry film was further dried at 160 °C for 10 h under vacuum. These as-prepared films were about 30–40 μm in thickness and subsequently used for solubility tests and thermal analyses.

Measurements
Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were recorded using a Bruker Vector 22 spectrometer at a resolution of 4 cm−1 in the range of 400–4000 cm−1. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were recorded on a BRUKER-300 spectrometer at 300 MHz for 1H NMR and 75 MHz for 13C NMR in deuterated DMSO. Inherent viscosities (ηinh) were measured using an Ubbelohde viscometer with a 0.5 g dL−1 of DMAc solution at 25 °C. Weight-average molecular weights (Mw) and number-average molecular weights (Mn) were obtained via gel permeation chromatography (GPC) analysis on the basis of polystyrene calibration on a PL-GPV 220 instrument with DMF as an eluent at a flow rate of 1.0 mL min−1. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis was performed on a TA instrument DSC Q100 at a scanning rate of 10 °C min−1 in a nitrogen flow of 50 mL min−1. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was conducted with a TA 2050, with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under a nitrogen atmosphere and in air. Electrochemistry measurements were carried out on a CHI 660e electrochemical analyzer. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was conducted with the use of a three-electrode cell. The working electrode was prepared by drop-coating of the polymer solutions onto an ITO glass substrate (the area of polymer films was about 0.5 × 2 cm2). A platinum wire was used as an auxiliary electrode and a homemade Ag/AgCl, KCl (sat.) was used as a reference electrode. Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectra were recorded using a Shimadzu UV 3101-PC spectrophotometer. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were recorded and fluorescence quantum yield were determined with an Edinburgh FLS920 fluorescence spectrophotometer. Fluorescence quantum yield (ΦF) was determined using a calibrated integrating sphere. The molecular simulations of the model compounds were performed using time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) at the B3LYP/6-31G (d, p) level.
Results and discussion
Monomer and polyamide synthesis
As shown in Scheme 1, a new diamine 3 bearing the bis(diphenylamino)-fluorene group was synthesized via a multistep route. 4-Methoxyaniline was made to react with 4-fluoronitrobenzene under triethylamine assistance yielding 4-methoxy-4′-nitrodiphenylamine. The diamine 3 was successfully synthesized by Pd/C-catalyzed reduction of the dinitro 2 resulting from the Ullmann reaction of 2,7-dibromo-9,9-dimethylfluorene and 4-methoxy-4′-nitrodiphenylamine. The structures of the intermediate compounds and the target diamine monomer 3 were analyzed and confirmed by FTIR and NMR techniques. The characteristic bands of nitro groups at around 1591 and 1322 cm−1 disappeared after the reduction reaction. Meanwhile, new stretching absorptions corresponding to the amino group appeared at 3371 and 3446 cm−1, indicating the formation of the new diamine. Furthermore, Fig. 1 illustrates the 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra of the diamine monomer 3 with the assignments for proton and carbon signals. All the NMR signals support that the target diamine monomer with the bis(diphenylamino)-fluorene group has been synthesized successfully.

Two kinds of polyamides were prepared from the diamine 3 with two different dicarboxylic acids through the phosphorylation technique42,43 (Scheme 2). The polymerization reactions proceeded homogeneously and afforded highly viscous polymer solutions. When pouring the resulting viscous solutions into methanol, these polymers precipitated in a yellow and fiber-like form. The inherent viscosities and molecular weights of these polyamides are summarized in Table S1.† Both these high-molecular-weight polyamides could be solution-cast into free-standing films. FTIR and 1H NMR spectra of these polyamides are illustrated in Fig. S1 and S2,† and agree well with their proposed structures.

Solubility and thermal properties
The solubility behaviors of polyamides 5a and 5b were examined qualitatively with the results summarized in Table S1.† These polyamides exhibited excellent solubility in polar organic solvents, which is much favorable to fabricate large-area thin film devices through convenient spin-coating processes for practical application. The thermal properties of these polyamides were investigated by TGA and DSC, and the results are summarized in Table 1. The Tgs of these polyamides were observed in the range of 251–277 °C (Fig. S3†). In TGA curves, during the process of decomposition, the 10% weight loss temperatures in nitrogen and air were recorded in the range of 440–479 °C and 439–472 °C, and the carbonized residue accounted for up to 50% at 800 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere. The excellent thermal properties are profitable for largely extending their service life in optoelectronic devices.

Optical and electrochemical properties
The optical and electrochemical properties of these polyamides were investigated by UV-vis, PL spectroscopy and CV, with the results summarized in Table 2. The absorption maxima of these polyamides are located at 389–391 nm in NMP solutions and 375–382 nm in solid films, respectively, which are ascribed to the π–π* transition of bis(diphenylamine-fluorene) moieties. The absorption edges of these polyamide films extended to 417–448 nm, from which the optical band gaps (Eg) were estimated to be 2.77–2.97 eV. As shown in Fig. 2(a), these polyamides in NMP solutions exhibited fluorescence emission maxima at 442–505 nm with ΦFs ranging from 1.9 to 50.2. It is interesting to note that the ΦF of the polyamide 5a is much higher than that of the polyamide 5b, for the reason that the aliphatic structure could effectively reduce the conjugation and the effect of the charge transfer complex.44 To obtain more insights into this phenomenon, the TD-DFT calculations were applied to clarify the nature of electronic transitions of the two model compounds. As depicted in Fig. 2(b), in the case of the model compound of polyamide 5a, the excited transition from the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) delocalized over the bis(diphenylamino)-fluorene moiety, implying the locally excited (LE) transition. On the other hand, for the model compound polyamide 5b, the HOMO level was located at the bis(diphenylamino)-fluorene moiety, while the LUMO level was located at the benzoyl moiety. As a consequence, the strong charge transition (CT) leads to a non-radiative transfer of energy, resulting in a low quantum yield.

The electrochemical properties of these polyamides were investigated by CV using 0.1 M TBAP as the supporting electrolyte and Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode in anhydrous CH3CN solution (Fig. 3 and S4†). The polyamides 5a and 5b both revealed two reversible oxidation redox couples with a low onset potential of 0.41 and 0.42 V, respectively, by which their corresponding HOMO energy levels were estimated to be 4.85 and 4.86 eV (on the basis that ferrocene/ferrocenium is 4.8 eV below the vacuum level with Eonset = 0.36 V). In addition, the LUMO energy levels were calculated from the equation: LUMO = HOMO − Eg. The details of the electrochemical data and energy levels of these polyamides are summarized in Table 2. Due to the high electrochemical stability of the polymer film and nice adhesion between the film and the ITO substrate, polyamide 5a exhibited excellent reversibility of electrochemical characteristics in 200 continuous cyclic scans, which is of great benefit in electro-switching systems.

Electrochromic and switching properties
During CV scans, the polyamide films were observed to switch their appearance colors obviously. Therefore, the spectroelectrochemical techniques were performed to evaluate their electrochromic properties. These two polyamides exhibited similar electrochromic properties, and the typical absorption spectral changes of polyamide 5a at different applied potentials are depicted in Fig. 4. Upon electro-oxidation steadily rising from 0 V to 0.7 V, the intensity of the characteristic absorption peak at 320 and 375 nm for the neutral form of the polyamide decreased gradually, while two new peaks at 485 and 1400 nm emerged, which can be ascribed to the formation of a monocation radical in the first stage oxidation. The broad NIR absorption at 1400 nm was the characteristic result of the intervalence charge transfer band, which was similar to the phenomenon reported earlier.30 With the potential further increased to 1.0 V, the absorptions at 485 and 1400 nm gradually decreased accompanying the appearance of a new peak at around 900 nm. The disappearance of the NIR absorption band could be attributed to the further oxidation of the monocation radical to the dication of the polyamide 5a. From the inset photos shown in Fig. 4, the color of the polyamide 5a film changed from nearly colorless to orange-red (semi-oxidized stage), and finally to brilliant blue (fully oxidized state).
 Fig. 4  Absorption spectra of the polyamide 5a thin film coated on an ITO glass substrate (in CH3CN with 0.1 M TBAP as a supporting electrolyte) at different applied potentials (0.0–1.0 V). The insets show the color changes of the film. 
Optical switching studies were carried out to investigate the electrochromic properties more deeply with the transmittance monitored at the given wavelength as a function of time by stepping the potential between the neutral and the oxidation states. The switching behaviors of polyamide 5a are depicted in Fig. 5. The switching time is defined as 90% of the time taken for the full switch. As shown in Fig. 5C, when the switched potentials were set between 0 and 0.7 V for the first oxidation stage, the switching time for coloration and blenching were 4.8 s and 2.1 s, respectively. When the potentials were switched between 0 and 1.0 V (Fig. 5D), the polyamide film required 4.6 s for coloration and 2.0 s for blenching. Coloration efficiency (CE) is also an important parameter for evaluating electrochromic materials, and the CE values (ΔOD/Qd, ΔOD = log(Tblenched/Tcolored)) of polyamide 5a after 1000 switching cycles were calculated and are summarized in Tables 3 and 4. The polyamide 5a film exhibited a high CE up to 257 cm2 C−1 at 1400 nm in the first cycle and the CE value could remain 94% after switching 1000 cycles between 0 and 0.7 V. After the applied switching potential was increased to 1.0 V, the CE is 278 cm2 C−1 and showed only 12.2% decay after 1000 cycles. The high values of CE indicate that the polyamide film could provide large optical modulation with a small intercalation charge density, which meet the requirement of low power consumption in smart windows.

Electrofluorescent properties
In light of the strong fluorescence as well as the excellent electrochemical stability of polyamide 5a, its electrofluorescence switching performance was examined by monitoring the photoluminescence intensity at different applied potentials. In the neutral state, the polyamide film showed vivid blue fluorescence (Fig. 6a). Upon application of positive potentials from 0 to 0.7 V, the fluorescence of the polymer film became weak and finally extinguished to dark, which can be ascribed to the quenching effect of the cation radical of polyamide 5a with strong absorption at 420–580 nm. When the reverse potential was applied, the quenched fluorescence could be recovered, and thus the oxidative quenching offered a high contrast ratio up to 152. In addition, no shift of the spectral band was observed during the changes in the fluorescence intensity, which indicates that the fluorescence quenching originated from the electrochemical oxidation of the neutral polyamide 5a to its cation radical form, without the production of side-products. Furthermore, the response behavior of the fluorescence switching was also investigated by repetitive cycling between −0.7 and 0.7 V. As shown in Fig. 6b, the switching process was quite reversible and reproducible between the fluorescent state and the non-fluorescent state. It was found that the contrast ratio greatly depended on the duration time with the ratio changing from 152 to 31 on reducing the duration time from 360 to 10 s. When the duration time was set at 10 s, no noticeable fluorescence changes in either the “on” or “off” states were observed in 100 cycles, indicating the excellent long-term stability of electrofluorescence switching. Thus, the highly stable electrochromic/electrofluorescent material polyamide 5a will actively promote the development of dual-switch displays in the future.

Conclusion
In this report, we have readily synthesized two kinds of novel electroactive polyamides with bis(diphenylamino)-fluorene units, which exhibited excellent solubility and thermal stability. Introduction of electron-donating methoxy substituents at the para-position of diphenylamine effectively reduces the oxidation potentials and increases the electrochemical stability of the resulting polyamides. These polyamides revealed multicolor electrochromic behaviors with attractive characteristics such as low switching times, high coloration efficiency and highly durable switching reversibility. Furthermore, the strong fluorescence of polyamide 5a could also be effectively modulated between the fluorescent state and the non-fluorescent state by electrochemical redox, exhibiting high contrast and superior stability. Thus, the reported properties prove that the polyamide 5a will contribute to the development of electrochromic/electrofluorescent dual-switching materials in the future. Further studies on the stimuli-responsive aspects of these materials for flexible devices are currently being carried out in our laboratories.
