    , Accepted 22nd October 2019First published on 22nd October 2019AbstractExpensive Pt counter electrodes remain an obstacle for the commercialization of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Therefore, research focusing on low-cost alternative counter electrode materials has been considered important for their commercialization. Here, the fabrication of dye-sensitized solar cells has been performed utilizing CoS2 and MoS2 coated CoS2 nanocomposite materials as the counter electrode, which are synthesized via a hydrothermal route involving low-cost precursor materials. The experimental results obtained from XRD, XPS, EDX, SEM, TEM, and Raman etc. have confirmed the successful formation of CoS2 and MoS2 coated CoS2 nanocomposites. The electrochemical characterization of these materials is performed, which suggests that the electrocatalytic activity towards the liquid iodine electrolyte of these materials is as good as that of the conventional Pt counter electrodes. So, dye-sensitized solar cell devices are fabricated by interpolating a (cis-bis(isothiocyanato)bis(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylato)ruthenium(II)) dye-loaded TiO2 photoanode and CoS2, MoS2 coated CoS2 and Pt counter electrodes using iodine/iodide as a liquid electrolyte. The devices fabricated with CoS2 counter electrodes have shown an open circuit voltage of 790 mV, a short circuit current of 11.9 mA cm−2, a fill factor of 0.54, and a power conversion efficiency of 6%. On the other hand, the device based on a Pt counter electrode has shown an open circuit voltage of 773 mV, a short circuit current of 13.4 mA cm−2, a fill factor of 0.54, and a power conversion efficiency of 6.6%. In addition, MoS2 coated with a CoS2 counter electrode has shown the best performance with an open circuit voltage of 763 mV, a short circuit current of 20.1 mA cm−2, a fill factor of 0.42, and a power conversion efficiency of 7.6%.
1. Introduction
Sunlight is a promising clean alternative energy source that may contribute to the global energy demand as it is abundant, renewable and free of cost. Dye-sensitized solar cells have received much attention due to their low manufacturing cost and ease of fabrication.1 The main components involved in the fabrication of DSSCs are (i) photoanode (most commonly TiO2 layer-coated FTO glass plate), (ii) light harvesting material (dye), (iii) redox electrolyte and (iv) Pt counter electrode (CE). Among them, CEs play an important role by accepting electrons from the anode and transferring those electrons to the electrolyte electrocatalytically by completing the electric circuit.2–4 The participation of CE in the liquid electrolyte reduction reaction may be described as follows: one molecule of iodine (I2) adsorbs on the CE surface resulting in the formation of two surface iodine atoms, which then produce solvated iodides at the electrolyte/CE interface. These iodides then regenerate the oxidized dye molecule.5Fig. 1 shows the schematic diagram of the reduction of a triiodide ion at the electrolyte/CE interface.
 Fig. 1  Schematic diagram of the triiodide reduction reaction at the electrolyte/CE interface. 
The usage of Pt as the CE in DSSCs is due to its excellent electrocatalytic properties towards the liquid electrolyte (iodine/iodide redox couple). However, its lower abundance, high-cost, and corrosiveness towards the liquid electrolyte6,7 limits its application in terms of commercialization. So, the focus on the alternative CEs in DSSCs came into focus. At the same time, it is mandatory to consider counter electrode materials which may be cheaper than Pt, and possess electrocatalytic properties as good as those of Pt CEs. In order to find low-cost materials as an alternative to Pt electrodes, investigations involving carbon materials, sulfides, carbides, selenides, oxides and importantly chalcogenides are going on due to their abundance and good electrocatalytic properties.3 Importantly, transition metal sulfides are being studied for the application of electrochemical conversion and energy storage applications.2–4 In this category, CoS2 has been reported as a counter electrode material in many research papers due to its electrocatalytic property, metallic and magnetic properties which may contribute electrical conductivity to some extent.8–12 But, the synthesis of pure-phase CoS2 is difficult due to the existence of non-stoichiometric compositions including Co4S3, Co9S8, CoS, Co3S4, and CoS2.13 Interestingly, all these materials including CoS2, CoS,14 Co9S8,15 and Co3S416 can be used as the counter electrode material in Pt-free DSSCs due to their efficient electrocatalytic properties. The composite materials prepared with MoS2 as one of the components showed improved photocatalytic activity owing to the synergistic effects with the enhanced absorption of light.17–19 In the same way, the electrical properties of the CoS2 nanomaterials can be modified; frequently, graphene20,21 and reduced graphene oxide22 are used to prepare the composite material to improve the performance of the material due to their excellent thermal and electrical conductivity, high surface area, and chemical inertness. Even though the nanocomposite materials with rGO showed better photoconversion efficiency due to the good electrical and conducting properties of rGO, but still, the preparation of this material is tedious (because many steps are involved in the synthesis) and suffers from low yield.23 In order to overcome this, one can go with the heterogeneous catalyst in which the heterojunction formed between the two materials play a key role making the composite material a potential candidate. For example, Baoshan Tang et al. demonstrated both theoretically and experimentally that the heterojunction formation of the CoS2/MoS2 composite synergistically improves the catalytic property due to the electronic transition between them.24 Shoushuang Huang et al. have modified the properties of CoS2 by synthesizing CoS2–CoSe2 heterostructured nanocrystals in N-doped CNTs and have achieved a photoconversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.45% which is better than that of Pt (8.07%) itself.25
In this work, we demonstrate that MoS2 can be employed to modify the electrocatalytic property of CoS2 by a simple one-step hydrothermal route of preparation. Since MoS2 has an analogous structure to graphene, it can be considered as a 2D layered material. Furthermore, the oxidation states of Mo atoms can exist in the range from +2 to +6 and Mo atoms can easily be involved in the redox reaction. In this context, CoS2 and MoS2 coated CoS2 nanocomposites have been synthesized using a hydrothermal method and, subsequently, they have been utilized as a counter electrode material for DSSCs. XRD analysis of the CoS2 sample revealed the presence of mixed phases of Co3S4 and CoS with the CoS2 phase due to the non-stoichiometric compositions of cobalt sulfide under solvothermal reaction conditions.26 The stoichiometric ratio of cobalt/sulfur precursors,27 heating time and temperature28 play a crucial role in the formation of the different crystal phases of cobalt sulfide. Even though the prepared MoS2 coated CoS2 sample consists of mixed phases of cobalt sulfide, the results obtained from this work demonstrated the excellent electrocatalytic performance and thus hold it as a promising counter electrode material for Pt-free DSSCs. The device measurements revealed interesting results showing that the DSSC fabricated with MoS2 coated CoS2 CE had the best overall efficiency performance with a PCE of 7.6%, while the Pt CE showed a PCE of 6.6%.
2. Experimental
2.1a Materials
Cobalt nitrate hexahydrate (Co(NO3)2·6H2O, hexaammonium molybdate tetrahydrate ((NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O)), thiourea (H2NCSNH2), chloroplatinicacid hexahydrate (H2[Pt(Cl)6]·6H2O), N3 dye (cis-bis(isothiocyanato)bis(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylato)ruthenium(II)), titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4) 1 M in toluene, titanium(IV) oxide nanopowder (P25), polyethylene glycol (PEG; MW = 10000), lithium iodide (LiI), acetylacetone (CH3COCH2COCH3), iodine (I2) and fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) glass plates (8 Ω) and isopropyl alcohol (IPA) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich and used without any further purification.
2.1b Synthesis of CoS2
CoS2 was synthesized based on the previously reported methods16,26,29 with a slight modification. Briefly, 1 mM of cobalt nitrate hexahydrate (Co(NO3)2·6H2O) and 10 mM of thiourea (H2NCSNH2) were dissolved in deionized water and continuously stirred for 30 min to form a homogeneous solution. Then, the solution mixture was transferred into a stainless steel autoclave and kept at 160 °C for 24 h. After completion of the reaction, it was allowed to cool to room temperature. The obtained precipitate was collected, washed with deionized water and ethanol several times, and finally, dried overnight at room temperature.
2.1c Synthesis of MoS2 coated CoS2 nanocomposite
To synthesize MoS2 coated CoS2 nanocomposites, 25 wt% of hexaammonium molybdate tetrahydrate ((NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O) was added into the precursor solution of cobalt nitrate hexahydrate and thiourea and then underwent the same steps as mentioned above. MoS2 nanosheets were synthesized by following the same procedure without adding cobalt nitrate hexahydrate to confirm the formation of MoS2 under the same reaction conditions.
2.2 Photoanode preparation
Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass plates were cut into 2 × 2 cm pieces, then subsequently cleaned in an ultrasonic bath using a mildly alkaline solution, deionized water, acetone and isopropyl alcohol for 10 min each. To avoid the recombination reaction between the liquid electrolyte and FTO, the blocking layer of TiO2 was coated on the cleaned FTO glass plates by immersing them (facing conductive side upwards) in a 40 mM aqueous solution of TiCl4 for 30 min at 70 °C. After attaining room temperature, the FTO/TiO2 (blocking layer) coated glass plates were rinsed with distilled water and ethanol and then dried at 100 °C for 10 min. The doctor-blade technique was adopted to coat the TiO2 layer using an invisible tape (thickness 55 μm) as a spacer to maintain a uniform thickness of the film. Then, the TiO2 coated films were dried to evaporate the solvents. Finally, these FTO/TiO2 plates were sintered at 450 °C for 30 min. The TiO2 paste used for the above purpose was prepared by mixing 0.16 mg of PEG (MW 10000) in 1 M HNO3 followed by the addition of 0.21 mL acetylacetone, 0.04 mL Triton-X and TiO2 (P25 Degussa) nanopowder. Then, the solution mixture was sonicated for 1 h and stirred for 24 h to get a colloidal solution of TiO2.30
2.3 Counter electrode (CE) preparation

2.3a CoS2 and MoS2 coated CoS2 nanocomposites as CEs. 
The as-synthesized CoS2 (10 mg) or MoS2 coated CoS2 nanocomposites were dispersed in IPA and sonicated for 30 min. Approximately 50 μL of this solution was drop-casted onto the pre-cleaned FTO glass plates and dried overnight at room temperature to evaporate the solvent. Likewise, MoS2 CE was prepared for comparison purposes.


2.3b Pt as a CE. 
On a pre-cleaned FTO glass plate, a 4 mM solution of H2[Pt(Cl)6]·6H2O in IPA was drop-cast and sintered at 450 °C for 30 min. After cooling down to room temperature, these plates were used as the counter electrode in DSSC for reference purposes.

2.4 Fabrication of DSSC
The prepared photoanodes (FTO/TiO2) were dye-sensitized by dipping into 5 mM N3 dye dissolved in tert-butanol/acetonitrile (v/v = 1:1) solution for 24 h under dark conditions. After being taken out from the dye solution, these dye coated FTO plates were rinsed with ethanol to remove the excess dye. The active area (0.25 cm2) of the cell was selected by removing the excess portion of the dye-coated TiO2 film layer by scraping. The prepared CoS2, and MoS2 coated CoS2 CEs were used as counter electrodes. MoS2 CE was used for the comparison study. Then, the photoanode and counter electrode were clipped together to fabricate the dye-sensitized solar cell device. A thin layer of parafilm was used to separate the electrodes from contacting each other to avoid creating a short circuit between two conductive surfaces of the electrodes. The solution mixture of 0.05 M I2/0.5 M LiI/0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine in 3-methoxypropionitrile (liquid iodine/iodide) was used as a liquid electrolyte.
2.5 Characterization and measurements
X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was performed using a Bruker D8 diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54 Å) at a scan rate of 0.04° min−1. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and EDX (energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy) analyses were studied by using a JEOL 7401F microscope, whereas, high-resolution transmission electron spectroscopy (HR-TEM) was performed by using a JEOL JEM 2010 microscope. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was performed by using a Thermo Scientific X-ray photoelectron spectroscope. Raman spectrum was recorded by using a Renishaw InVia Raman microscope. Fourier Transform-Infrared (FT-IR) measurements were carried out by using the KBr pellet method using a Thermo Scientific Nicolet iS5 FT-IR spectrometer. The electrochemical analysis was performed by using the Metrohm AUTOLAB12/FRA2 PGSTAT302N electrochemical analyzer assembly with NOVA software version 1.10. Cyclic voltammograms (CVs) of Pt, CoS2, MoS2 coated CoS2 nanocomposite CEs were carried out in acetonitrile solution consist of 0.05 M LiI, 0.01 M I2, and 0.5 M LiClO4 at the potential range −0.6 V to +1.2 V at the scan rate of 10 mV s−1 using 3 electrode system (Ag/AgCl) as reference electrode and Pt wire as counter electrode. For CVs, the samples were drop-casted onto the pre-cleaned FTO glass plates so that the area of the sample was 1 × 1 cm2 and dried at room temperature overnight. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were conducted by fabricating dummy cells using two identical electrodes (the samples were prepared by the same method as the counter electrode preparation aforementioned), which were clipped together and parafilm was used to separate the electrodes from contacting each other. The exposed electrode area was 0.25 cm2. The frequency range was set from 0.1 to 105 Hz and the amplitude of the sinusoidal AC voltage was 10 mV. The photovoltaic performance of the fabricated solar cells was characterized by using the Metrohm AUTOLAB12/FRA2 PGSTAT302N associated with a solar simulator with a Xe arc lamp (85 mW cm−2, AM 1.5 G). The incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra were recorded using an Oriel 300 W Xe Arc lamp in combination with an Oriel Cornerstone 260¼ monochromator. A calibrated monocrystalline silicon diode was used as a reference to calculate the number of incident photons for each wavelength. The ZSimpWin software was employed to fit the EIS data. The J–V measurements have been recorded under 1 sun illumination for a cell area of 0.25 cm2. N3 dye was employed as a light harvester and a liquid iodine/iodide redox couple has been used as an electrolyte. CoS2 and MoS2 coated CoS2 nanocomposite CEs were used as counter electrodes and the observed results are compared with those of Pt CE.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Structure and morphology characterization
The counter electrode materials (CoS2 and MoS2 coated CoS2 nanocomposites) have been synthesized by a hydrothermal route. The possible reactions31 of the formation of the products are as follows: (NH4)6Mo7O24 + 4H2O → 7MoO42− + 6NH4+ + 8H+(1) SC(NH2)2 + 2H2O → 2NH3 + H2S + CO2(2) Co2+ + 4NH3 → [Co(NH3)4]2+(3) 5[Co(NH3)4]2+ + 7S2− → CoS2 + CoS +Co3S4 + 20NH3(4) 5[Co(NH3)4]2+ + 8S2− + MoO42− → CoS2 + Co3S4 + CoS + MoS2 + 20NH3 + SO42−(5)
Firstly, ammonium molybdate dissolves in water giving molybdate ion (MoO42−) in which Mo is in +6 oxidation state. Then Mo6+ is reduced to Mo4+ thereby forming MoS2 by thiourea. Here, thiourea is acting as both a reducing agent and sulphur source. Co2+ from a cobalt source forms a complex with ammonia, then the sulphur which is released from thiourea reacts with this complex producing mixed phases of cobalt sulfide (CoS, CoS2, and Co3S4).
The samples have been analyzed by X-ray diffraction to determine the crystal structure of the samples (see Fig. 2(a)). The peak values of 2θ at 32.4°, 36.4°, 39.9°, 46.5°, 55.0°, and 62.8° referring to the (2 0 0), (2 1 0), (2 1 1), (2 2 0), (2 2 1), and (3 2 1) planes corresponding to CoS2, match well with the JCPDS card no. 65-3322. It shows the formation of the cubic phase of CoS2 with the lattice parameters a = b = c = 5.53 Å. In the MoS2 coated CoS2 nanocomposites, we noticed peaks at 26.4° and 47.2° which are assigned to the (2 2 0) and (4 2 2) planes, respectively, due to the presence of a Co3S4 cubic crystal system (JCPDS card no. 00-042-1448). The peak found at 30.9° corresponding to the (1 0 0) plane belongs to the CoS hexagonal crystal system (JCPDS card no. 03-065-3418). The overall XRD patterns of CoS2 and MoS2 coated CoS2 suggest the multi-phase nature of CoS2 due to the presence of compounds Co3S4 and CoS, which are consistent with previous literature.12,32–34 When MoS2 is introduced into the CoS2 system, the increase in non-stoichiometric compounds of CoS2 is observed and it may be due to the presence of MoS2 in the reaction mixture during the hydrothermal synthesis. The diffraction peaks at 29.2°, 44.2°, 58.1°, and 60.5° correspond to MoS2 present in the MoS2 coated CoS2 nanocomposites representing the (0 0 4), (0 0 6), (2 0 0), and (0 0 8) planes (JCPDS card no. 00-037-1492). The extra peaks present in both the CoS2 and MoS2 coated CoS2 nanocomposites suggest the absence of phase purity due to the non-stoichiometric nature of CoS2. The presence of mixed phases of Co3S4 and CoS along with the CoS2 phase might be due to the non-stoichiometric nature of cobalt sulfide under solvothermal reaction conditions.26 When an attempt was made to prepare the Co9S8 phase of cobalt sulfide at a low temperature (150 °C), Peng-Fei Yin et al. found the presence of CoS2 and Co3S4 phases along with the Co9S8 phase; so they annealed the sample at 250 °C to convert CoS2 and Co3S4 to the Co9S8 phase to attain phase purity of Co9S8.35 The peak at 18.8° belonging to the (1 1 1) plane is noticed in the MoS2 coated CoS2 nanocomposite XRD pattern, which represents the cubic crystal system of Co3O4 (JCPDS card no. 01-080-1543). The absence of phase purity of CoS2 is in good agreement with the results reported in the literature.13,34 This finding suggests that the phase purity of CoS2 is highly dependent on the reaction conditions and precursor materials chosen.

Fig. 2(b) shows the FTIR spectra of CoS2 and MoS2 coated CoS2 nanocomposites, respectively. The peak found around 920 cm−1 is due to the presence of a Mo–S vibration band which is not found in the CoS2 sample suggesting the formation of MoS2. The peak around 1400 cm−1 is associated with the ammonium group. The appearance of a peak around 1060–1095 cm−1 is attributed to the CoS stretching supporting the formation of cobalt sulphide. The stretching and bending vibrations of surface water are found at around 3300–3500 cm−1 and 1625–1631 cm−1, respectively, in all the samples.36–41
The morphological studies were performed using SEM and TEM analyses. Fig. 3(a) shows the SEM images of CoS2 and MoS2 coated CoS2 composites. The image shows the formation of a densely layered 3D flower-like morphology of CoS2. Fig. 3(b) shows the MoS2 coated CoS2 nanocomposites in which a well coated thin layer of MoS2 over the CoS2 layer can be seen, which looks like a jute twine-ball. The flower-like morphology of the CoS2 is retained and the MoS2 nanosheets are well coated over the CoS2 layer. This may be supported by the difference in the rate of formation of CoS2 and MoS2 in the nanocomposites. During the reaction, the Mo–O bond should break first from MoO4− ions before approaching the sulphur ion (S2−) to form a Mo–S bond and this does not occur in the case of Co–S bond formation, which may slow down the formation of MoS2 that may help it grow over the CoS2 layer.36 This may help to improve the morphology of the material which plays a crucial role in the performance of the device by serving as a reservoir of liquid electrolyte and it provides more contact between the electrolyte and counter electrode. The SEM image of MoS2 coated CoS2 nanocomposites looks more porous than that of the CoS2 itself. In 100 nm resolution (Fig. S1, ESI†), it is clearly visible that the porous nature of the material significantly increased, which plays a crucial role in the performance of the device by serving as a reservoir of liquid electrolyte and it provides more contact between the electrolyte and counter electrode. For comparison, the SEM images of MoS2 are depicted in Fig. S2 (ESI†).
 Fig. 3  FE-SEM images of (a) CoS2 and (b) MoS2 coated CoS2 nanocomposites, respectively. (c and d) EDX results of CoS2 and MoS2 coated CoS2. 
The elemental composition of the samples was analyzed by FE-SEM-EDX. The images depicted in Fig. 3(c and d) show the presence of Mo in the CoS2 system, further confirming the formation of MoS2 coated CoS2 nanocomposites. The difference in the ratio of the metals to sulphur (Fig. 3(c and d) insets) indicates the presence of the other phases which is in accordance with the XRD patterns of both CoS2 and MoS2 coated CoS2 nanocomposites.42 The SAED pattern and corresponding elemental mapping of MoS2 coated CoS2 nanocomposites are depicted in Fig. S3 (ESI†). It shows the crystalline pattern for the CoS2 sample and amorphous nature of the MoS2 coated CoS2 sample. The increase in amorphous nature of the MoS2 coated CoS2 could be due to the presence of MoS2 nanosheets, which shows an amorphous nature (Fig. 2(a) – XRD of MoS2) and which is in good agreement with previous literature.30 The elemental mapping of Co, Mo, S, and O shows a uniform distribution of MoS2 coated CoS2 nanocomposites, as shown in Fig. S3(c–f) (ESI†).
TEM and HR-TEM images of CoS2 and MoS2 coated CoS2 nanocomposites are shown in Fig. 4, which further strongly supports the formation of MoS2 coated CoS2 nanocomposites. The XRD of MoS2 coated CoS2 shows the presence of CoS2, MoS2, and Co3S4 in the nanocomposites. This is well supported by the HR-TEM images which show the d spacings of 0.23 nm corresponding to the (2 1 0) plane of CoS2, 0.62 nm corresponding to the (0 0 2) plane of MoS2 and 0.33 nm corresponding to the (2 2 0) plane of Co3S4. Simultaneously, the HR-TEM image of the CoS2 sample is depicted in Fig. S4a (ESI†) which shows the presence of (2 2 0) planes corresponding to CoS2, (1 0 2) corresponding to CoS, and (2 2 0) corresponding to Co3S4 phases which match well with the XRD results shown in Fig. 2(a).

XPS analysis was carried out to study the chemical composition and the oxidation states of the elements present in the MoS2 coated CoS2 nanocomposites Fig. 5(a–d). The binding energy peaks at 778.5 and 794 eV representing Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2 of Co2+, respectively, confirm the presence of cobalt in a +2 oxidation state. The existence of Co3+ is identified from the binding energy peaks at 781.1 and 797.5 eV. The peak at 802.5 eV is attributed to the shake-up peak of Co 2p1/2. The Mo spectrum shows that the peaks at 232.1 and 229 eV correspond to Mo4+ 3d5/2 and Mo4+ 3d3/2, respectively, which confirms the presence of Mo4+ in the composite. Also, it is noticed that the peaks are at 236.3 eV for the Mo–O bond due to the exposure to air, which indicates the presence of some amount of Mo6+, and at 168.7 eV for the S–O bond in the S 2p spectrum.43 The high resolution S 2p spectrum shows the peaks at 162.9 and 161.6 eV, which are ascribed to 2p1/2 and 2p3/2, respectively. The above results from the XPS spectra confirm the formation of the CoS2–MoS2 composite and these are in good agreement with results in the previously reported literature.44–48

Raman spectroscopy was utilized to study the crystal structure of the MoS2 coated CoS2 nanocomposite sample and the spectrum is depicted in Fig. S4b (ESI†). The peak at 391 cm−1 indicates CoS2 which suggests an Ag mode of CoS2 in the sample.32 At the same time, the peak found at 416 cm−1 for J2, corresponds to A1g modes of vibration of MoS2,30,45 confirming the presence of MoS2 in the composite. The peak shift from 406 cm−1 of MoS2 to 416 cm−1 of MoS2 coated CoS2 shows the electronic transition between CoS2 and MoS2, which strongly supports the formation of a MoS2 coated CoS2 nanocomposite material.24
3.2 Electrochemical characterization
The electrocatalytic properties of the CEs have been investigated by performing cyclic voltammetry (CV) in 3-methoxy-propionitrile solution consisting of 0.05 M LiI, 0.01 M I2, and 0.5 M LiClO4 in the potential range from −0.6 V to 1.2 V at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 using a three electrode system (Ag/AgCl as a reference electrode, Pt wire as a counter electrode, and the prepared CEs as the working electrode). The CVs of Pt, CoS2, and MoS2 coated CoS2 nanocomposite electrodes are shown in Fig. 6(a). The appearance of the two peaks (oxidation and reduction) suggests that CoS2 and MoS2 coated CoS2 nanocomposite electrodes can be applicable to DSSCs as counter electrodes similar to Pt CE. The redox reaction of I−/I3− involves the anodic reaction (3I− → I3− + 2e−; 2I3− → 3I2 + 2e−) and cathodic reaction (3I2 + 2e− → 2I3−; I3− + 2e− → 3I−). In a DSSC, the counter electrode plays a major role in reducing the iodine/iodide electrolyte (I3− + 2e− → 3I−) which is involved in the regeneration of the oxidized dye molecule.3 The redox reaction of I−/I3− can be investigated from the cathodic peak potential (Epc), cathodic peak current (Ipc) and peak to peak voltage separation (Epp). The higher the Ipc value, the higher the electrocatalytic activity of the electrodes. The lower Epp value indicates a better electrocatalytic activity of reduction of I3− ions. As can be observed from CV loops, the device with the Pt CE shows the highest Ipc among the other CEs (CoS2 and MoS2 coated CoS2 nanocomposites). It indicates the good electrocatalytic activity of Pt CEs toward the liquid electrolyte. However, more positive peak to peak voltage separation values (Epp) of other CEs explains the better reduction of iodine/iodide electrolyte (I3− + 2e− → 3I−) than that of the Pt CE itself. In this study, the order of Epp of Pt, CoS2 and MoS2 coated CoS2 CEs is as follows: Pt (497 mV) > CoS2 (412 mV) > MoS2 coated CoS2 (404 mV), which suggests the higher electrocatalytic activity of MoS2 coated CoS2 electrode than those of both the Pt and CoS2 CEs. In Fig. 6(a), again, the higher Ipc of MoS2 coated CoS2 nanocomposite CE than that of CoS2 CE suggests a better electrocatalytic activity which is reflected in the device performance i.e., the power conversion efficiency of 7.6% with the best JSC value of 20.1 mA cm−2 among the other CEs.

The interfacial behaviours of the two identical electrodes in the electrolyte medium (0.05 M LiI, 0.01 M I2, and 0.5 M LiClO4 in 3-methoxypropionitrile) have been studied by the electrochemical impedance spectroscopic analysis. The measured data reveal the electrocatalytic behaviours of the different electrodes, which reflect in the photovoltaic performance of the DSSCs. Electrode–electrolyte impedance has been measured by recording the EIS from 0.1 Hz to 105 Hz under dark conditions at 10 mV ac amplitude. EIS spectral parameters of dummy cells fabricated with Pt, CoS2, and MoS2 coated CoS2 are listed in Table 1. The series resistance (RS) (related to the combination of Warburg diffusion impedance, to the charge transfer and recombination processes at TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface and to the resistance of FTO glass plate)2 can be measured from the intercept on the real axis in the high-frequency region. The semicircle in the intermediate frequency region represents the charge transfer resistance (RCT) and the corresponding constant phase element (CPE). The semicircle on the low-frequency region represents the Warburg diffusion impedance (Zw). From Table 1, the RS values of the respective CEs follow the order: MoS2 coated CoS2 CE (8.99 Ω cm2) > CoS2 CE (5.45 Ω cm2) > Pt CE (5.20 Ω cm2) which is directly accountable for the fill factor (FF) values of the DSSCs fabricated with the respective CEs. On the other hand, FF follows the order of MoS2 coated CoS2 CE (0.42) < CoS2 CE (0.54) ∼ Pt CE (0.54). Here, the lowest RCT value for the Pt electrode (21.44 Ω cm2) suggests a superior electrocatalytic activity comparing to other CEs (CoS2 showed 48.65 Ω cm2 and MoS2 coated CoS2 showed 75.79 Ω cm2). In particular, the lowest Epp value of MoS2 coated CoS2 CE among other CEs may be responsible for the electrocatalytic ability and the best overall performance efficiency (7.6%) of the device even though it suffers from a higher RCT value. The Tafel slope of the dummy cells (Fig. S7, ESI†) follows the same order of JSC and the overall performance efficiency of CEs of MoS2 coated CoS2 > Pt > CoS2.

The influence of photovoltaic performance of the DSSCs fabricated with Pt, CoS2 and MoS2 coated CoS2 CEs may not be similar according to the RS values observed in Table 2. The higher FF value (0.54) observed for CoS2 CE compared to MoS2 coated CoS2 CE (0.42) resulted from the lower RS value (5.45 Ω cm2) of CoS2 electrode performance from the EIS of two identical CoS2 electrodes (Table 1). The MoS2 coated CoS2 CE shows the highest RCT value of 17.33 Ω cm2, which is responsible for the reduction in charge recombination reaction at the TiO2/electrolyte interface49 and the order of RCT values is as follows: MoS2 coated CoS2 CE (17.33 Ω cm2) > Pt (14.53 Ω cm2) > CoS2 (8.07 Ω cm2). The same order of the photovoltaic parameters JSC and %PCE is observed from the solar cell devices fabricated with the respective CEs. The device with the Pt CE shows 6.6% power conversion efficiency with a VOC of 773 mV, JSC of 13.4 mA cm−2 and FF of 0.54. The increase in VOC from 773 to 790 mV and decrease in JSC from 13.4 to 11.9 mA cm−2 have been noticed for CoS2 CE compared to Pt CE. The decrease of the JSC, observed for the CoS2 CE, can be related to an increase of the recombination phenomenon within the device. This result is consistent with the reduction in the RCT value, observed in Fig. 7(b).
Even though the solar cell fabricated with MoS2 coated CoS2 CE exhibits a higher value of RCT compared to the other counter electrodes, the overall performance of the device results shows the best efficiency performance among them, as follows: MoS2 coated CoS2 CE (7.6%) < Pt CE (6.6%) < CoS2 CE (6%). This may be due to the lowest RS value observed for the MoS2 coated CoS2 CE device. The series resistance of the Pt CE shows the value of 7.31 Ω cm2 which is higher than the RS value of the MoS2 coated CoS2 CE (6.54 Ω cm2) and less than the RS of the CoS2 CE (9.39 Ω cm2). Overall it follows the order of MoS2 coated CoS2 CE (6.54 Ω cm2) < Pt CE (7.31 Ω cm2) < CoS2 CE (9.39 Ω cm2), which is well supported by the overall performance of the devices (MoS2 coated CoS2 CE (7.6%) < Pt CE (6.6%) < CoS2 CE (6%). Fig. S5 (ESI†)) shows the Nyquist plots of DSSCs assembled with Pt, CoS2 and MoS2 coated CoS2 CEs measured under both dark and illumination conditions suggesting the changes in recombination resistances and corresponding electron lifetimes (Fig. S6, ESI†) under dark and light conditions. In order to investigate the recombination phenomena within the DSSC devices, the impedance spectra measured in dark conditions were used to evaluate the electron lifetime (τ). The τ values have been calculated from the value of maximum peak frequency obtained from Bode-phase plots (Fig. S6, ESI†) by the following equation. (6)where f is the maximum peak frequency obtained from the Bode-phase plot.
As can be observed, the MoS2 coated CoS2 as the CE leads to an increase of the τ value up to 30.8 ms compared to the reference solar cell with Pt as the CE. Therefore, the devices based on MoS2 coated CoS2 as the CE exhibit a lower recombination rate (due to higher RCT value), as clearly observed in Table 2. As a consequence, the DSSC fabricated with MoS2 coated CoS2 as the CE shows a higher value of PCE of 7.6% compared to that of the solar cell fabricated with CoS2 (6%) and to that of the reference Pt-based device (6.6%). The device characterization of the MoS2 CE has been displayed in the ESI† (S9) for comparison purposes.
In order to evaluate the charge carrier absorption and collection at the contacts within the DSSCs, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements have been performed. The light-harvesting property at a particular wavelength of the solar cell can be studied by the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) which is also referred to in the EQE spectra. The EQE spectrum gives information about the details i.e., the number of electrons generated in the external circuit by the incident light by following the formula (7)A high IPCE value over a broad spectral range suggests the effective photon-to-current conversion and, subsequently, high-performance efficiency of the device. In agreement with the J–V characteristics, the MoS2 coated CoS2 CE shows a higher intensity of the EQE spectrum (Fig. S8, ESI†) compared to those of the other CEs in the whole wavelength range. Here, the photocurrent density values evaluated from the integral of the EQE spectra are consistent with those estimated from the J–V characteristics. In particular, the maximum value in the EQE spectra of 16.3% at a wavelength of 530 nm, 23.2% at 350 nm and 28.7% at 530 nm are observed for Pt, CoS2 and MoS2 coated CoS2 CEs, respectively. Even though the MoS2 coated CoS2 CE shows lower VOC (763 mV) and FF (0.42) than Pt (VOC = 790 mV and FF = 0.54) and CoS2 (VOC = 773 mV and FF = 0.54) CEs, it exhibits the maximum JSC of 20.1 mA cm−2, which is also supported by the EQE spectra (Fig. S8, ESI†).
4. Conclusions
CoS2 and MoS2 coated CoS2 nanocomposites were successfully synthesized by a hydrothermal route. Based on the physical and electrochemical characterization, these materials were used as counter electrodes for dye-sensitized solar cells. The performance efficiency of the fabricated devices showed 6.6%, 6.0%, and 7.6% for Pt, CoS2, and MoS2 coated CoS2 CEs, respectively. The CoS2 CE showed good power conversion efficiency, however, the introduction of MoS2 into the CoS2 system significantly enhanced the overall power conversion efficiency by a synergestic effect (due to the presence of Co3S4) and electron transition at the interface formed between them. The low-cost nanocomposite materials were applied as the CE in DSSCs in order to replace the noble metal Pt CE. However, more optimization in the material selection, the precursor ratio, and the parameters involved in the hydrothermal process may help in the achievement of a better electrocatalyst which may permanently replace the Pt CE in DSSCs and this may allow the fabrication of low-cost dye-sensitized solar cell devices.
