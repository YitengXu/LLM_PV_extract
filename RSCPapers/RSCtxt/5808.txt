    , Accepted 12th December 2019First published on 14th December 2019AbstractIn this work, we used a ternary blend strategy to improve the photovoltaic performance of organic solar cells (OSCs). PBDB-T:IDT-EDOT-based binary blend devices show a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 9.93%, and the ternary devices with PC71BM as the third component exhibit a PCE of 12.07% with simultaneously enhanced Voc, Jsc and FF. The broadened absorption, optimized morphology and balanced charge carrier mobility of these devices are responsible for these improvements. The introduction of PC71BM can disperse the IDT-EDOT aggregates, enhance the phase purity, and increase the electroluminescence quantum efficiency (EQEEL). Furthermore, the performance of the ternary devices is not very sensitive to the weight ratio of the two acceptors. PCEs of over 11% are obtained even though the composition gradually varies from 1:1:0.2 to 1:0.4:0.8. Our results demonstrate that PC71BM is a highly promising second acceptor for the construction of high-efficiency ternary OSCs.
Introduction
Over the past several decades, bulk heterojunction polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted much attention due to their advantages such as low cost, flexibility, and light weight.1–4 The photoactive layer of PSCs usually consists of a polymer donor and a small molecular acceptor.5–7 Earlier, fullerene derivatives such as PC61BM and PC71BM played a dominant role as acceptor materials due to their terrific electron mobility, isotropic charge transport properties and large electron affinity.8–10 However, PSCs with fullerene derivatives as acceptors hit a bottleneck preventing further improvements in the power conversion efficiency (PCE) due to their inherent disadvantages such as weak absorption in long-wavelength regions, expensive synthetic cost, and limited tunability of energy levels and optical properties.11–13 In recent years, the PCEs of PSCs have increased rapidly, mainly due to the development of efficient nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs).14–23 NFAs, especially fused ring electron acceptors (FREAs), have many advantages, such as facile synthesis, adjustable energy levels, tunable optical properties, and high molar extinction coefficients.24–27
Recently, PCEs of over 16% and 17% have been attained for single- and tandem-junction PSCs, respectively.28–34 Compared with single-junction PSCs, tandem-junction PSCs usually consist of two or more sub-cells with complementary absorption spectra, harvesting high- and low-energy photons in the separated sub-cells. This is beneficial for solar energy conversion. Nevertheless, tandem PSCs face many challenges due to complicated fabrication processes, which limit their further practical applications.
Ternary PSCs are promising for achieving broad absorption. Compared with tandem solar cells, ternary devices inherit the simplicity of single-junction PSCs and can realize broad absorption through suitable material combination.35–40 Ternary blend PSCs may have a configuration of either two acceptors/one donor (A1:A2:D) or one acceptor/two donors (A:D1:D2).41,42 Ternary PSCs based on polymer donors, such as FREAs and PC71BM, which were first reported by our group, have shown great potential in improving device performance.43
In our previous work, an A-π-D-π-A-type FREA named IDT-EDOT was designed and synthesized; this device possessed a planar conformation and displayed a high absorption coefficient in the long-wavelength range (788 nm). We achieved a PCE of 10.29% for the as-cast devices based on PBDB-T:IDT-EDOT.44 Here, we adopt the ternary blend strategy to further enhance the photovoltaic performance of the PBDB-T:IDT-EDOT-based device. PC71BM was selected as the third component because of its excellent charge transport mobility and absorption spectrum, complementary to those of PBDB-T and IDT-EDOT. In addition, we demonstrate that the incorporation of PC71BM can lead to further optimized active layer morphology, improved charge carrier mobility, and suppressed charge carrier recombination. Furthermore, the addition of PC71BM can also lead to a decreased size of IDT-EDOT aggregates, improved EQEEL, and reduced nonradiative energy losses. As a result, the FF, Jsc and Voc of the ternary PSCs with PC71BM were much higher than those of the binary solar cell based on PBDB-T and IDT-EDOT. The as-cast ternary PSCs displayed a PCE of 12.07% when the composition of the active layer was PBDB-T:IDT-EDOT:PC71BM = 1:0.6:0.6. Moreover, the performances of the ternary devices were not very sensitive to the weight ratio of the two acceptors (IDT-EDOT and PC71BM). PCEs of over 11% were obtained when the composition of the ternary blend film (PBDB-T:IDT-EDOT:PC71BM) varied from 1:1:0.2 to 1:0.4:0.8, which is seldom observed for previously reported ternary PSCs.
Optical properties
The chemical structures of PBDB-T, IDT-EDOT and PC71BM are shown in Fig. 1a The optical properties of the pure and blend films were investigated by UV-vis absorption spectroscopy, and the absorption spectra are shown in Fig. 1b. The PBDB-T film shows a broad absorption range from 500 to 770 nm with an absorption peak at 632 nm and a shoulder at 586 nm, and the IDT-EDOT film displays a broad absorption range of 600 to 850 nm with two peaks located at approximately 709 and 789 nm. The PC71BM film exhibits weak absorption in the short-wavelength region (300–700 nm). These three materials exhibit complementary absorption features; thus, the absorption spectrum of the ternary blend film covers a very broad region from 300 to 900 nm. The energy levels of PBDB-T, IDT-EDOT and PC71BM, as illustrated in Fig. 1c, exhibit a cascade-like alignment, which could reduce the energy barrier for charge carrier transfer in the active layer and facilitate charge carrier transport.45

Photovoltaic properties
OSCs were investigated in devices with a configuration of Ag (100 nm)/MoO3 (80 Å)/active layer (100 nm)/zinc oxide (30 nm)/ITO, where ITO is indium tin oxide, and the zinc oxide layer was prepared according to a previous report.46 Various conditions were employed to optimize the photovoltaic performance, such as active layer composition and thickness and solvent additives. For binary OSCs, the optimal condition for fabricating devices is a 1,2-dichlorobenzene (DCB) solution (polymer concentration: 5 mg mL−1) with a D:A ratio of 1:1.2 (weight by weight, w/w). For ternary OSCs with PC71BM acting as a solid additive, by adjusting the proportion of two acceptors, an optimal device performance was obtained with a ratio of 1:0.6:0.6 (PBDB-T:IDT-EDOT:PC71BM). The device parameters are summarized in Tables 1 and S1–S4.† We also studied the use of PC61BM as the third component, which results in a decrease of photovoltaic performance. The results are summarized in Table S5.† The optimized current–voltage (J–V) curves and the external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves are displayed in Fig. 2. The binary devices based on PBDB-T:IDT-EDOT and PBDB-T:PC71BM gave moderate PCEs of 9.93% and 7.63%, respectively, which is consistent with previous literature results.44,47 After using PC71BM as the third component, the photovoltaic performance was significantly improved. As shown in Table 1, when the composition of the active layer was PBDB-T:IDT-EDOT:PC71BM = 1:0.6:0.6, the optimal device demonstrated an excellent PCE of 12.07% (FF = 66.7%, Jsc = 20.84 mA cm−2, and Voc = 0.88 V). Notably, in comparison with the binary devices, the ternary devices exhibited an increased Jsc and FF, resulting in an improved photovoltaic performance, which is attributed to not only the broadened adsorption but also the purer pristine phases and more balanced charge transport mobility (vide infra). Interestingly, the ternary devices displayed slightly higher Voc than the corresponding binary devices, which has rarely been reported in previous literature. Moreover, solar cells with PC71BM acting as the third component were not very sensitive to the weight ratio of the two acceptors (IDT-EDOT and PC71BM), and PCEs of over 11% were obtained when the composition of the ternary blend film (PBDB-T:IDT-EDOT:PC71BM) was in the range of 1:1:0.2 and 1:0.4:0.8. Fig. 2b shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the devices in a D/A ratio of 1:1.2 (w/w) with different proportions of PC71BM. The Jsc values obtained by integrating the EQE curves agree well with the Jsc values from the J–V measurements (within 5% deviation). Compared to the binary device (PBDB-T:IDT-EDOT), the ternary devices with PC71BM displayed an enhanced photo-to-current response in the wavelength range from 350 to 450 nm, resulting in enhanced Jsc. The maximum EQE value of the optimal ternary devices reached 74.6%, which is much higher than that of the binary solar cells based on PBDB-T:IDT-EDOT (69.4%).

Morphological characterization
To better understand the influence of the third component (PC71BM) on the device performance, the morphologies of the blend films were investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), as shown in Fig. 3 and S1.† The PBDB-T:IDT-EDOT-based blend film exhibited an inhomogeneous surface morphology with a relatively large root-mean-square (RMS) roughness value of 3.10 nm, as shown in Fig. 3a. The large aggregates observed in the AFM images are likely formed by IDT-EDOT; the IDT-EDOT aggregates disappear upon decreasing the ratio of the acceptor to polymer in the blend film, as shown in Fig. S1.† Only an appropriate D/A ratio can give rise to the optimal device performance, as shown in Table S1.† The interlaced nanofibrils observed in the TEM images were probably formed by the aggregation of PBDB-T.48,49 In comparison, the PBDB-T:PC71BM blend film had a much more homogeneous surface morphology without apparent phase separation. For the ternary blend film with the composition optimized for device performance (PBDB-T:IDT-EDOT:PC71BM = 1:0.6:0.6), moderate phase separation with a reduced RMS value of 1.49 nm was observed, and the TEM image shows thin and tenuous nanofibrils formed by the polymer donor PBDB-T. From the above results, we can see that the addition of PC71BM as the third component could lead to an optimized morphology of the active layer. After the addition of PC71BM, the concentration of IDT-EDOT in the blend system decreased, reducing the domain size of the IDT-EDOT aggregates. Another possible reason for the morphology change is that PC71BM could influence the aggregation of IDT-EDOT during the drying of the blend film.

To further investigate the energy transfer from IDT-EDOT to PC71BM, the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of PBDB-T, IDT-EDOT and IDT-EDOT:PC71BM films were obtained under 530, 650 and 650 nm light excitation, respectively, as shown in Fig. S2.† The thickness of the neat and blend films used for the PL measurements was approximately 100 nm. To confirm the results of microscopy measurements, spectroscopic photoluminescence quenching measurements were performed. The emissions of PBDB-T in both the binary and ternary blend films were completely quenched. However, the emission of IDT-EDOT at 900 nm was better quenched in the ternary blend film than in the binary blend film, as shown in Fig. S2.† This suggests that the addition of PC71BM can improve the exciton dissociation efficiency of ternary blend solar cells.
Furthermore, the Voc of the binary device based on PBDB-T:IDT-EDOT was slightly increased, from 0.87 V to 0.88 V, after the addition of PC71BM, although the binary device based on PBDB-T:PC71BM had a lower Voc (0.83 V). To understand the change in Voc after the addition of PC71BM, Voc losses in the solar cells based on IDT-EDOT and PC71BM were studied using detailed balance theory for organic solar cells; i.e., Voc is related to the charge transfer state properties of the blend system, according to the equation:50  where q is the elementary charge, k is the Boltzmann constant, c is the speed of light, ECT is the energy of the charge transfer state, f is the absorption oscillator strength of the CT state, λ is the reorganization energy, and EQEEL is the external quantum efficiency of the electroluminescence of the solar cell. First, we measured the electroluminescence (EL) spectra of the binary solar cells, as shown in Fig. 4a. An emission peak at 1.25 eV was observed for the binary solar cell based on PC71BM and was redshifted, compared to the emission peak (located at 1.45 eV) observed for the binary device based on PBDB-T:IDT-EDOT. This suggests that the ECT of the binary solar cell based on PC71BM is indeed much lower than that of the solar cell based on IDT-EDOT. However, the addition of PC71BM to the PBDB-T:IDT-EDOT blend does not reduce the ECT: the peak position of the EL emission of the ternary device is very close to that of the binary device based on PBDB-T:IDT-EDOT. To better compare the ECT of solar cells with and without PC71BM, highly sensitive Fourier transform photocurrent spectroscopy (FTPS) measurements were performed. We determined ECT by taking the value from the crossing point between the FTPS-EQE (FTPS-EQE) and the reduced EL spectra. As shown in Fig. 4b, the ECT of the solar cell was slightly increased, from 1.48 eV for binary devices (PBDB-T:IDT-EDOT) to 1.5 eV for ternary devices, which is likely due to the optimized morphology of the active layer after the addition of PC71BM. Therefore, the improved Voc of the solar cell after adding PC71BM can be partially ascribed to the increased ECT. In addition, we found that the external quantum efficiency of electroluminescence (EQEEL) of the solar cell based on IDT-EDOT was also increased after the addition of PC71BM (Fig. 4c). The increased EQEEL leads to a lower voltage loss for non-radiative charge carrier recombination, thus further improving the Voc of the solar cell.

We also measured the charge carrier lifetime using a transient photovoltage decay method. As shown in Fig. 4d, compared to the lifetime of charge carriers in the PC71BM-based binary devices, the charge carrier lifetime is shorter in the IDT-EDOT-based binary devices. Nevertheless, the lifetime of the charge carriers in the ternary device was the same as that in the binary device based on PBDB-T:IDT-EDOT. This indicates that the addition of PC71BM to the device did not lead to any change in the non-radiative recombination rate of charge carriers. Therefore, the improved EQEEL is mostly due to the increased radiative recombination rate of the charge carriers. Because the charge carrier lifetime is similar in the active layer with or without PC71BM, the improved FF after the addition of PC71BM is mostly due to the improved charge carrier mobilities, which can be related to the optimized morphology. Grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS)51 measurements were performed to obtain insight into the molecular crystalline orientations and the aggregation behaviours of polymer donors and acceptors in pure and blend films. The GIWAXS 2D patterns and the corresponding line profiles of pure and blend films are shown in Fig. 5. The neat IDT-EDOT film exhibited weak in-plane (IP) (100) lamellar and out-of-plane (OOP) (010) π–π stacking diffraction peaks, indicating low crystallinity. However, the PBDB-T:IDT-EDOT blend film displayed strong (100) and (010) diffraction peaks, which can be ascribed to the strong crystallinity of PBDB-T. With the incorporation of PC71BM, all of the ternary blend films exhibited a high degree of molecular order with strong in-plane (IP) (100) lamellar stacking and out-of-plane (OOP) (010) π–π stacking diffraction peaks, indicating that the face-on orientation is preferred. However, with increasing PC71BM content, the crystal coherence length of the (100) diffraction peak decreased (see Table S6†), indicating that the crystallinity of the blend films slightly decreased. These phenomena are consistent with the AFM and TEM measurement results, indicating that the introduction of PC71BM as the third component could adjust the phase morphology and reduce the roughness of the blend films.

Resonant soft X-ray scattering (R-SoXS)52–54 reveals the domain size and phase purity of the blend films. As shown in Fig. S3 and Table S7,† the blend film with a ratio of PBDB-T:IDT-EDOT:PC71BM = 1:0.6:0.6 displays a relatively small domain size (22 nm), indicating that there are abundant D/A interfaces that can facilitate efficient exciton separation to achieve high Jsc. Furthermore, the phase purity increased from 0.77 in the binary PBDB-T:IDT-EDOT and 0.52 PBDB-T:PC71BM blends to approximately 1 in the ternary blend, which contributes to less bimolecular charge recombination and thereby an elevated FF of 67%. Eventually, appropriate crystallinity, a small domain size and a high average domain purity could be obtained for the blend film with a ratio of PBDB-T:IDT-EDOT:PC71BM = 1:0.6:0.6, which resulted in an excellent PCE of 12.07%.
The increased domain purity of ternary devices led to an improvement in charge carrier mobility. Indeed, the hole and electron mobilities (μh and μe) of IDT-EDOT-based solar cells, which were evaluated using the space-charge-limited-current (SCLC) method (Fig. S4 and Table S8†), were both increased dramatically after the addition of PC71BM. In addition, the electron and hole mobilities displayed a better balance after the addition of PC71BM, which can explain the improved FF of the ternary devices.
Conclusions
In conclusion, PBDB-T, IDT-EDOT and PC71BM with complementary absorption were used to fabricate ternary blend PSCs. The binary blend devices based on PBDB-T:PC71BM and PBDB-T:IDT-EDOT showed PCEs of 7.41% and 9.93%, respectively. Amazingly, the optimal ternary devices with an optimal weight ratio of PBDB-T:IDT-EDOT:PC71BM = 1:0.6:0.6 demonstrated a PCE of 12.07%. Higher Voc, Jsc and FF values were obtained for the ternary device than for the corresponding binary PSCs. Such a markedly increased photovoltaic performance of ternary blend PSCs can be mainly ascribed to the broadened absorption, improved active layer phase morphology, and more balanced charge transport mobility. Further investigations revealed that the introduction of PC71BM led to smaller IDT-EDOT aggregates, increased phase purity, and improved electroluminescence quantum efficiency (EQEEL). Moreover, the ternary devices were not very sensitive to the composition of the active layer. PCEs of over 11% were obtained when the weight ratio of the ternary blend film (PBDB-T:IDT-EDOT:PC71BM) varied from 1:1:0.2 to 1:0.4:0.8. Our results demonstrate that PC71BM is highly promising as a second acceptor for constructing high-efficiency ternary organic solar cells.
