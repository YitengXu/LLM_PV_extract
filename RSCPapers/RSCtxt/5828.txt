However, the complex structure of biomass makes it difficult to convert into high-value products. Utilization of lignocellulosic biomass in a green and effective way is of great significance for sustainable development.

1. Introduction
Biomass plays an essential role in energy supply, and approximately 25% of global energy is being supplied by biomass instead of fossil fuels.1,2 As an alternative to fossil fuels, biomass has the merits of being abundant, cheap and clean with high utilization potential, and it has been identified to be one of the most important energy sources in the future.3,4 Among various kinds of biomass resources, lignocellulosic biomass represents a natural renewable chemical feedstock that can be used to produce high value-added products.1 It has been estimated that the worldwide production of lignocellulosic biomass is about 1.3 × 1010 metric tons per annum,5,6 among which China is responsible for 25% of the world's cotton production and produces 126 million metric tons of wheat straw. Europe accounts for 64% of the global oat straw production. The corn stover that accounts for 80% of the agricultural residue is produced in the U.S.A. Brazil produces 25% of the world's sugarcane bagasse.7
Lignocellulosic biomass can be further segmented into different types, such as forestry (birch, eucalyptus, spruce, oak, pine, poplar), forestry waste (the residues of trees and shrubs, sawdust), energy crops (sorghum, miscanthus, kenaf, switchgrass, corn, sugarcane), agricultural residues (corn stover, wheat straw), algae, industrial and domestic waste (waste paper, fruit or vegetable waste), and any other animal manure (cattle, swine, poultry). These lignocellulosic biomass resources significantly differ in the contents, compositions and structures of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin with completely different properties.
Lignocellulosic biomass can be used to obtain electrical/thermal energy or bio-fuel for transportation, or as raw materials for the production of chemicals, and their specific applications continue to grow and are increasing rapidly. Briefly, their utilization can be divided into thermochemical, biochemical, and chemical processes.8,9 In the thermochemical process, lignocellulosic biomass is directly used in the combustion, pyrolysis, gasification, and hydrothermal technology. Combustion is the simplest technology for converting biomass to electricity and thermal energy. This process takes place at 800–1000 °C with high NOx and SOx emissions, causing environmental pollution,8 and the electrical efficiency of biomass combustion is only 20–35%.10 Pyrolysis and hydrothermal technologies are employed to convert lignocellulosic biomass to bio-oil, bio-char, and gas,11 and generally large amounts of energy are needed for cracking.12,13 H2, CO, CO2 and CH4 are the main gases produced from the lignocellulosic biomass gasification.8 After further purification and reforming, the syngas can be further converted into fuels for power generation, electricity and heat, or chemicals.8,14–16 Although biomass gasification is a low-cost and low-emission technology, the high amount of tar produced in the gasification process and low fuel flexibility cause technical problems for its application.14 In addition, the reforming process also needs energy, for example, in the tar reforming process, a temperature above 1100 °C is needed,17 and high amounts of water and energy are also needed in the steam reforming process.18 In a word, the thermochemical process is with low efficiencies and/or high energy-demands for lignocellulosic biomass utilization,3 and thus the investigation on the high-value utilization of lignocellulosic biomass in alternative ways has attracted great interest, especially in the last decade.
The biochemical process has been proposed as an alternative to the thermochemical process, in which the lignocellulosic biomass is broken down into sugars that can then be converted into biofuels (gaseous or liquid fuels) and bioproducts (alcohols, organic acids, or hydrocarbons) through the use of microorganisms and enzymes.19 The most popular biochemical technologies are anaerobic digestion and fermentation.8 These conversion processes take place under mild reaction conditions with low energy utilization, and pretreatment is used to enhance the hydrolysis for further conversion without separation. However, this process takes a long reaction time of 2 to 4 weeks,20 and, currently, it is still unable to completely utilize the lignocellulosic biomass.21 Moreover, the high cost of microorganism cultivation, low hydrolysis rates and low yields impede its application.20
In fact, lignocellulosic biomass is composed of cellulose, lignin and hemicellulose, and each component has its own special characteristics. For example, cellulose and hemicellulose are the carbohydrate components, and are valuable feedstocks for bioenergy production, while lignin is an aromatic polymer consisting of propenyl phenol units, and is promising for obtaining synthetic aromatic polymers.22 To maximize the utilization with the consideration of characteristics of each component, the cascade utilization of lignocellulosic biomass should be the best option, where the lignocellulosic biomass is first pretreated and then separated into different components and then further used individually based on their characteristics to produce high-value products (Scheme 1). Compared with the thermochemical and biochemical processes, this process can utilize lignocellulosic biomass effectively and completely, and the products are more diverse.
 Scheme 1  Cascade utilization of lignocellulosic biomass. 
To achieve cascade utilization, the separation of lignocellulosic biomass to different components is a key step. However, the complex structure of lignin constitutes the most recalcitrant component, which makes it the greatest barrier to achieve an economic separation.23,24 To improve the separation performance, pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass has been proposed, and its essential role has been highlighted. Various methods have been reported, and briefly, they can be classified into two branches: conventional and non-conventional pretreatments. The typical conventional pretreatment includes mechanical (grinding, milling, chopping), chemical (alkali, acid, H2O2), organosolv (methanol, ethanol, formic acid, acetic acid), biological (fungi), and thermal (hydrothermal, steam explosion) processes. The non-conventional pretreatment can either involve an ultrasonic method or supercritical fluids, microwave irradiation, electric and/or magnetic fields, and ionic liquids (ILs).25 Recently, the concept of “Green Chemistry” has gained increasing attention, further imposing the development of novel technologies to use biomass in a more environment-friendly manner, eliminating waste and avoiding the use of toxic and hazardous materials. A lot of work has been conducted with rapid progress in the area of non-conventional pretreatment, making it necessary to update the summary of the research status in this aspect.
After pretreatment, the separation can be performed. To the best of our knowledge, the technology development in the separation unit is very limited, and currently, the conventional methods, such as extraction, regeneration, centrifugation, filtration, distillation and drying, are widely used. After the separation, a lot of research work has been conducted to obtain biochemicals, biofuels and other high-value products from individual components based on their characteristics. For example, cellulose and hemicellulose have been studied to produce pulp, biofuel, carbon material, nanofibrous materials, low molecular-weight chemicals (e.g., methane, ethanol, formic acid and acetic acid), and 5-hydroxymethyl furfural. Lignin has potential to convert to renewable alternatives and synthetic aromatic polymers (e.g., polyimide, thermoplastics, phenolic resin and composite films), as well as biogas, phenol, furfural, ethanol, succinic acid, and levulinic acid.22 The annual number of publications based on cellulose applications is about 8000, and that on the lignin applications is more than 3000.26
Considering the importance of biomass utilization for various high-value products and the rapid research process in this area, review articles have been reported based on biomass pretreatment and utilization, for example, the review articles for biomass pretreatment concerning (1) oxidative pretreatment processes;24 (2) emerging technologies of ultrasound, microwave, gamma ray, electron beam, high hydrostatic pressure and high pressure homogenization;27 (3) hydrodynamic cavitation (HC) process;23 (4) chemical, mechanical, thermal, and biological pretreatment;25 (5) plasma pretreatment;2 (6) hydrothermal biomass processing;3 (7) subcritical and supercritical water (SCW) hydrolysis;28 (8) supercritical water (SC-H2O) technology;29,30 (9) IL pretreatment.31 The review articles on biomass utilization are mainly based on (1) ultrasound-assisted biological conversion of biomass and waste materials to biofuels;32 (2) lignin conversion to high-value polymeric materials;33 (3) bio-based bioplastics;34 (4) lignin conversion to low-molecular-weight aromatics;35 (5) conversion of cellulose into key platform chemicals;36 (6) converting biomass to biofuels,37,38 renewable chemicals,37,39 and fermentable sugars40 in SCW; (7) hydrogen production from biomass and biomass gasification in SC-H2O;41,42 (8) ultrasound enhanced ethanol production from Parthenium hysterophorus.43 The articles or reports on biomass cascade utilization are mainly focused on (1) strategies for a more efficient cascade utilization of biomass;44 (2) barriers to cascading biomass use and policy responses;45 (3) definitions, policies and effects on the international trade of woody biomass cascade utilization;46 (4) from theory to practice of increasing resource efficiency by biomass cascade utilization.47 However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no review articles that summarize the research work from the angle of cascade utilization with “green” technologies covering the whole chain from biomass pretreatment to high-value products.
To fulfil this gap and to promote the cascade utilization of lignocellulosic biomass, this review was to conduct the literature survey and then summarize the research work from the angle of cascade utilization covering the whole chain. The specific content was focused on the non-conventional lignocellulosic biomass pretreatment methods with 4 proposed evaluation levels, and the high-value products derived from lignin, hemicellulose, and cellulose. 500+ latest published articles were collected and analyzed and then narrowed down to 300+ relevant papers for further review in order to avoid repetition of the published reviews. The potential research tasks were identified and the need for future research was highlighted. In addition, for the cascade utilization, the structures and properties of the lignocellulosic biomass as well as those for each constituent-component are of importance, and thus, a brief description was provided in the beginning of the review as a background.
2. Lignocellulosic biomass and its structure
The compositions of lignin, hemicellulose and cellulose in lignocellulosic resources vary for different types of plant resources. Cotton may contain as high as 98% cellulose, and coniferous wood may have approximately 90% cellulose.48 Basically, softwood consists of a higher amount of lignin (25–35%) compared to other types of biomass, while hemicellulose is in a relatively greater proportion of 25–35% in hardwood than that in softwood with a value of 20–30%.4,49 The compositions of cellulose, lignin and hemicellulose in various lignocellulosic resources are summarized in Table S1, ESI.† Several reviews have introduced the lignocellulosic biomass structures. For example, Vanneste et al.2 and Moon et al.50 introduced the cellulose structures. Hu et al.51 introduced the main hemicellulose monomeric sugars as well as the main hemicellulose structures in hardwoods and softwoods. Bugg et al.,52 Dutta et al.53 and Mao et al.54 described the structural units and chemical linkages found in lignin. Zakzeski et al.55 indicated the representative structures for a hardwood and softwood. Ragauskas et al.56 reported the primary monolignols in different types of lignocellulosic biomass resources. Based on these reports, the detailed structures of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin are given as follows:
Cellulose is a linear polymer consisting of several hundred to over ten thousand β-(1 → 4)-linked glucose repeating units, together with numerous intra-molecular (between the same chains) and inter-molecular hydrogen bonds (between the neighboring chains).2,6,57 The inter- and intra-chain hydrogen bonding network makes cellulose a stable polymer and gives cellulose fibrils high axial stiffness. Cellulose chains are arranged in highly ordered crystalline regions as well as amorphous or disordered regions as illustrated in Fig. 1.50 The coexistence of ordered and disordered regions makes cellulose insoluble in water and in the common organic solvents.58
 Fig. 1  (a) Molecular structure of a single cellulose chain (n = DP, degree of polymerization). (b) Schematics of an idealized cellulose microfibril with the configurations of crystalline and amorphous regions.50 
Hemicellulose is a heterogeneous polysaccharide and located between the lignin and cellulose fibers, and it has a random and amorphous structure with low strength. Unlike cellulose, hemicellulose consists of shorter chains with 500–3000 sugar units per polymer.51 The structure and polymeric properties depend on the origin (i.e., plant species), the industrial processing as well as the isolation and purification procedures. Based on the structure of the cell wall, generally, hemicellulose can be further divided into four types: xylan, mannan, β-glucan with mixed linkages, and xyloglucan.59 Among them, xylan is the major component (Fig. 2a). It is usually built up from a β-(1 → 4) linked xylopyranose backbone chain and substituted with sugar units such as α-L-arabinofuranose, O-acetyl groups or 4-O-methyl-glucuronic acid residues, while the occurrence of homoxylan is very rare. Table S2† illustrates the monosaccharide composition and the type of xylan for hemicellulose from different biomass resources.60 From Table S2,† it can be found that agriculture waste such as wheat straw, rice husk and rye bran has a less complex structure containing arabinose substituents. The hemicellulose in hardwood (e.g., aspen, birch) is mainly composed of 4-O-methylglucuronoxylan. In the backbone of hardwood hemicellulose, approximately 10% of xylopyranose is substituted by 4-O-methyl glucuronic acid (Fig. 2b). The main component of softwood hemicellulose is O-acetyl-galactoglucomannan, and the backbone is composed of mannose units combined with glucose units randomly (Fig. 2c). Compared with softwood, hardwood hemicellulose contains acetyl substituents besides the methyl-glucuronic acid residues. In addition, xylan in softwood carries non-acetyl substituents.51

Lignin is a cross-linked racemic macromolecule and is relatively hydrophobic and aromatic. It fills the space between the hemicellulose structures, covering the cellulose skeleton and making the lignocellulosic matrix.25 It is a three-dimensional polymer without any sugar in it. The basic monomers forming the repeat units of lignin are p-coumaryl alcohol (H-unit), coniferyl alcohol (G-unit) and sinapyl alcohol (S-unit), and they are interconnected heterogeneously via several types of C–C (i.e., β-1′, β-5′, β–β′, 5–5′) and C–O (i.e., β-O-4′, α-O-4′, 4-O-5′) linkages.6,26,52 The monolignol composition of the lignin polymer is dependent upon the cell type, environmental conditions and plant species. For example, grass contains all three subunits, i.e., H/G/S-lignin, with a proportion of 5–33/33–80/20–54. Hardwood contains G- and S-lignin in a roughly equal proportion, whereas softwood is rich in G-lignin with a proportion of 95–100.61 The various linkages and model compounds are given in Fig. 3, and their structures and contents of chemical linkages are displayed in Table 1.

3. Green and efficient pretreatment process
Pretreatment is often needed to change the individual component content or their structure for achieving an efficient separation. Conventional pretreatment methods have been widely used but with different challenges. For example, the mechanical (or physical) pretreatment method can control the particle size and make it easy for material-handling, but the high energy utilization makes it prohibitively expensive for large-scale implementation.62 An alternative is the chemical method that can be either acid-, alkali- or oxidation-based. The acid-based pretreatment is mainly on converting hemicellulose to monosaccharides, whereas the alkali- and oxidation-based methods are to remove lignin and hemicellulose. Compared with the acid pretreatment, the alkaline method results in less sugar degradation while the oxidative method can achieve fewer by-products. However, all these chemicals are corrosive and toxic, and have high cost.27 In the organosolv process, the internal lignin and hemicellulose bonds are broken down, increasing the surface area, while the organic solvents are associated with low-boiling-point, flammability, volatility, and high cost.63 In the biological hydrolysis, the yield is relatively low along with a long duration without a catalyst. The hydrothermal process is an approach in which the water in the liquid or vapor phase is used to pretreat lignocellulosic biomass without any catalyst and corrosion problem. Steam explosion is a successful option that involves heating lignocellulose with superheated steam followed by a sudden decompression.13 However, high processing temperature results in high water consumption and large energy inputs for hydrothermal and steam explosion processes.
To cope with the challenges of conventional pretreatment methods, non-conventional technologies have been proposed, such as ultrasound, supercritical fluids, microwave irradiation, electric and/or magnetic fields, HC and ILs. Review articles have been published for these emerging non-conventional pretreatment technologies. Therefore, in this section, only the recent research work on unconventional technologies of the microwave irradiation, supercritical fluids, ultrasonic irradiation, electric field, HC, and ILs has been surveyed and reviewed.
Based on a comparative survey and analysis of the experimental results, literature publications including 20+ publications for microwave irradiation pretreatment since 2014, 60+ publications for supercritical fluids since 2011, 100+ publications of ultrasonic irradiation since 2013, 15+ publications of HC since 2015, 20+ publications of electric field since 2015 and 100+ publications of ILs since 2017 were first chosen. Afterward, the contents of lignin, hemicellulose and cellulose after pretreatment were evaluated, summarized and compared. Overall, the content variation depends on the pretreatment methods, and it can decrease, increase or show no effect. To further quantify, considering that the average influence on the lignin content is about 50% (mainly decrease), 4 levels were used to identify the effects of the pretreatment on the lignin, hemicellulose and cellulose contents quantitatively, based on the chosen 300+ literature publications. The results are summarized in tables, where the slight- or no effect is marked as “—”, and the effect below 35% is marked as “L1”, from “35 to 60%” is marked as “L2”, and more than 60% is marked as “L3”. The best recovery or extraction yield of these three compounds is also given in the tables for each pretreatment method. The main contributions of each method were briefly introduced in the following subsections.
3.1 Microwave irradiation
Over the past 30 years, microwave irradiation has been studied to pretreat different lignocellulosic biomass resources. Compared with conventional heating, microwave irradiation has significant merits: (1) fast heat-transfer and short reaction-time, (2) selective and uniform volumetric heating performance, (3) easy operation and high energy-efficiency, and (4) low degradation or low formation of by-products. Moreover, the microwave hydrothermal pretreatment removes more acetyl groups in hemicellulose.64 For microwave irradiation, the main drawback is that the composition, geometry and size affect the distribution of microwave power, which may lead to a local overheating phenomenon.65 According to the analysis of the studied articles, the microwave assisted pretreatment technologies can be classified into five main groups: microwave-water, microwave-acid, microwave-alkali, microwave-deep eutectic solvent (DES), and microwave-ILs (Table 2). With the microwave-water pretreatment, the contents of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin are slightly increased or decreased, and lignin can be removed depending on the feedstock and pretreatment conditions. It has been demonstrated that the microwave-water pretreatment can only slightly dissolve other components rather than cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin.65,66

With the microwave-acid pretreatment, hemicellulose and lignin are removed, leaving cellulose in the solid residues. The cellulose content reaches 76.1% after pretreatment and separation. Sometimes, this method does not result in a considerable removal of hemicellulose and lignin (e.g., from beech wood) but causes the destruction of the biomass structure. The structure destruction can enhance further conversion.67 The effect of the type of acid was studied systematically by Avelino et al. based on the lignin extraction from coconut, and the result indicated that the microwave-H2SO4 pretreatment has a higher lignin extraction of 56.6%, followed by –HCl of 54.4% and –CH3COOH of 9.2%. CH3COOH as a catalyst shows poor ability to produce H3O+ ions and results in low yield, which are responsible for the protonation of ether groups presented in lignin.68
The effects of microwave assisted alkali-pretreatment with alkalis such as NaOH and Ca(OH)2 were studied by Jin et al.66 The contents of both hemicellulose and lignin are decreased due to their solubility in the solvents. For example, the content of lignin in catalpa sawdust decreased from 18.95 to 17.09% and that for hemicellulose decreased from 17.21 to 15.82%, while that for cellulose it increased from 50.87 to 55.78% after the microwave-NaOH pretreatment. For microwave-Ca(OH)2 pretreatment, the contents of lignin and hemicellulose decreased to 16.77 and 14.71%, respectively, while the cellulose recovery was up to 56.28%. More serious erosion on the catalpa sawdust surface was observed with SEM after the microwave-Ca(OH)2 pretreatment, indicating that microwave-Ca(OH)2 is more promising than microwave-NaOH.
DESs have the characteristics of both ILs and organic solvents, and they have emerged and widely accepted as a new generation of green solvents with the merits of easy and cheap fabrication and no need for purification.69,70 DESs show effects on delignification.71,72 45% delignification was achieved by microwave irradiation with a three-component DES (lactic acid/glycerol/choline chloride) after treating wheat straw.73 DESs can thus be used as a hydrolytic medium for lignocellulose pretreatment because of the partial dissolution of lignin. Choline chloride (ChCl) was selected to couple with amines, carboxylic acids and alcohols to obtain three kinds of DESs. All of them showed good solubilities of xylan and lignin but poor solubility of microcrystalline cellulose (MCC). After microwave-DES treatment for 3 min and separation, the extracted lignin showed a low molecular weight of 913 and is consisted of lignin oligomers with a high purity of 96%. The explanation is based on the fact that the chloride ions break the intramolecular hydrogen-bond network, and the oxalic acid contributes to dissolving lignin fractions and polysaccharides. In addition, it was found that the microwave radiation can maximize the ionic characteristics and increase the molecular polarity of DESs, and both the processing time and temperature can be decreased.66 The same phenomenon can be found in the process of microwave assisted ILs as another kind of green solvent. Based on the experimental results of the conventional and microwave-IL heating, the amount of dissolved lignin is virtually the same with both heating sources, while the dissolution rate is significantly faster under the microwave irradiation (about 5 min) compared to the conventional heating with over 8 h.74
3.2 Supercritical fluids
Supercritical fluids possess favorable properties such as low viscosity, high diffusivity, high dissolving power and low surface tension, enhancing mass transfer of solutes inside a solid matrix. The supercritical fluids used to pretreat lignocellulosic biomass include supercritical CO2 (SC-CO2), subcritical and supercritical water (SCW), supercritical H2O (SC-H2O), supercritical ethanol (SC-ethanol), or the mixtures of SC-CO2 with co-solvents, such as H2O, ethanol and ILs under their supercritical conditions.
SC-CO2 has been of interest in recent years because it is a low-cost reagent with a low critical temperature and pressure as well as low viscosity, non-toxicity, recyclability and environmental friendliness.78 During the pretreatment, the CO2 molecules penetrate into the micropores of lignocellulosic biomass, causing a physical change and destroying the structure by a rapid release of CO2.79 Meanwhile, the dissolution of CO2 into the water in the lignocellulosic biomass forms carbonic acid in situ, acting as a reagent of hemicellulose hydrolysis and then breaking the hydrogen bond between cellulose, hemicelluloses and lignin. In addition, the water in the lignocellulosic biomass helps to enlarge its micropores, allowing CO2 molecules to penetrate deeper during the explosive release of CO2 pressure,80 while ethanol only behaves as a good polar solvent in the pretreatment.78 The CO2 can be removed in the depressurized process to avoid further environment and corrosion problems.81,82 Water under sub- and supercritical or supercritical conditions behaves totally different from that under ambient conditions, and it was evidenced as a good medium for lignocellulosic biomass based on the following advantages:37,38,40,83 (1) wet biomass can be directly used as feedstock, (2) free water can be removed in the liquid state without vaporization, (3) rapid reaction speed (i.e., several seconds) can be achieved, and (4) low dielectric constant and high ion products (i.e., H+ and OH−) behave as non-polar solvents that can dissolve and degrade a variety of lignocellulosic biomass resources even without any additives. SCW can be used either as a pretreatment for the selective fractionation of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin or as a reaction medium to directly hydrolyze the lignocellulosic biomass into sugars.40 However, the costs are high for the supercritical pretreatment due to the high pressures and the high energy required for the application.28,84
The capacity of supercritical fluids for pretreating lignocellulosic biomass is summarized in Table 3. SC-CO2 was used to pretreat the empty fruit bunch80,85 and bagasse.86 The result showed that the contents of lignin, hemicellulose and cellulose only slightly change after pretreatment; however, the sugar yield increases. It has been evidenced that the mixtures of SC-CO2 and SC-H2O or SC-ethanol have a stronger effect than SC-CO2. As shown in Table 3, when the co-solvent of SC-CO2/H2O/ethanol was employed to pretreat biomass, for example, rice husk,84 corn stover,78 sugar cane bagasse and Pinus taeda wood chips,87 the delignification reached 93.1% for wood chips.87 Lü et al. studied SC-CO2/H2O, SC-CO2/ethanol and SC-CO2/H2O/ethanol, individually and as mixtures, based on corn stover.78 For SC-CO2/H2O, the fiber-surface of corn stover becomes porous and forms visible cracks, meanwhile, a lot of small particles deposit on the fiber surface. However, such surface deposition cannot be observed for SC-CO2/ethanol, which may be attributed to the good solubilities of lignin and hemicellulose in ethanol. For SC-CO2/H2O/ethanol, the fibers crimp and fold noticeably and become loose and rough, and the surface area of fibers increases significantly. These results suggest that SC-CO2/H2O/ethanol can disrupt the compact matrix structure of corn stover, making the cellulose fibers highly exposed. The cellulose content after SC-CO2/H2O/ethanol pretreatment reaches 74%; however, the hemicellulose and lignin contents are only 9% and 6%, respectively. The cellulose content after SC-CO2/H2O/ethanol pretreatment is richer than those with SC-CO2/H2O (38%) and SC-CO2/ethanol (43%). An innovative method for the pretreatment of sugarcane bagasse using SC-CO2/H2O2 under mild conditions was proposed.88 This method was found to be superior to the individual pretreatment with SC-CO2, ultrasonic irradiation or H2O2, and the sequential combination of SC-CO2 and ultrasound results in almost the double yields of cellulose and hemicellulose. It was stated that during the pretreatment, the hydroxyl radicals (HO) and superoxide anion radicals (O2) produced by the decomposition of H2O2 in the alkali can oxidize and degrade lignin, and thus the pretreatment with SC-CO2/H2O2 achieves relatively high amounts of cellulose and hemicellulose.

The poplar and pitch pine woods were pretreated with SCW by Kim et al.89 As shown in Table 3, cellulose/hemicellulose was easily hydrolyzed during SCW pretreatment into monomeric sugars with the total yield of 7.3% and 8.2% for poplar wood and pitch pine wood, respectively. In addition, the effect of HCl on the yield of monomeric sugars was also investigated during SCW pretreatment. It was found that the total yield of monomeric sugars was increased about 3-fold to 23.0% for poplar wood and 25.1% for pitch pine wood, respectively, in the presence of 0.05% (v/v) of HCl. Holm oak wood was pretreated with SCW.90 Cellulose and hemicellulose were solubilized and partially hydrolyzed, and a sugar yield of 75% was reached, mainly composed of xylose and glucose oligomers and smaller amounts of other chemicals (e.g., acetic acid or 5-HMF).
SC-H2O has been successfully used to yield sugar, biochemical and biofuel from biomass at a significantly large scale. For example, Renmatix commercially produces a variety of products from the fermentable sugars derived from the reaction of non-food biomass with SC-H2O via its Plantrose process.91 ARA has developed SC-H2O-based cleanup and conversion technologies to produce biofuel and biochemical from biomass for over a decade.92 Licella Holdings and Canfor Pulp companies constructed a large biorefinery to convert the woody waste to biocrude oil by SC-H2O.93 These technologies break down a wide range of non-food biomass in seconds, while other processes take days (e.g., enzymatic hydrolysis). The SC-H2O with and without catalysts can be used to pretreat lignocellulosic biomass (Table 3). SC-H2O was used to pretreat Nannochloropsis microalgae,94 sugar beet pulp95 and Quercus mongolica,96 showing that SC-H2O pretreatment allowed a selective and simultaneous recovery of both cellulose and hemicellulose fractions as C5 and C6 sugars, and obtained a lignin-like solid fraction.95 Jeong et al. used SC-H2O and SC-H2O/H2SO4 (0.05%) as the media to pretreat Quercus mongolica individually.96 27.8% sugar yield was achieved for SC-H2O pretreatment, while it is 49.8% for SC-H2O/H2SO4. SC-CO2/SC-H2O was used to pretreat Pocidonia oceanica residues.97 The result indicates that SC-CO2 can be used as a pretreatment method for increasing the availability of hemicelluloses and celluloses. Under the optimized conditions, 14.1 g L−1 reducing sugar was obtained by consecutive SC-CO2/SC-H2O hydrolysis. Romero et al. pretreated sugar beet pulp with two catalysts of Ru/MCM-48 and Ru/C using SC-H2O.98 The prepared catalyst of Ru/MCM-48 showed better behavior than the commercial Ru/C, and 15% yield of hexitols was achieved after SC-CO2/Ru/MCM-48 pretreatment. Sheikhdavoodi et al. studied sugarcane bagasse gasification in SC-H2O/KOH.99 Sugarcane bagasse was completely gasified and 75.6 mol kg−1 hydrogen was achieved.
Li et al. produced bio-oil from rice stalk by supercritical ethanol (SC-ethanol) liquefaction (Table 3).100 It was indicated that hemicellulose was the main reaction compound during SC-ethanol pretreatment and a maximum value of 55.03% bio-oil was achieved from rice stalk. SC-ethanol/subcritical CO2 and subcritical CO2/subcritical H2O were used to produce bio-oil from rice straw.101 It was found that the bio-oil yield of SC-ethanol/subcritical CO2 (47.78%) is higher than subcritical CO2/subcritical H2O (23.59%). In SC-ethanol/subcritical CO2, SC-ethanol donates hydrogen, promoting the reaction of hydroxyl-alkylation. While in subcritical CO2/subcritical H2O, CO2 promotes the carbonyl reaction. Sorghum bagasse was modified with Fenton's reagent and then selectively depolymerized in SC-ethanol,102 and a maximum yield of 75.8% phenolic oil was acquired. The result indicated that the Fenton's reagent modification not only increases the yields of phenolic monomers, particularly ethyl-p-coumarate and ethyl-ferulate, but also enhances the hydrolysis.
3.3 Ultrasonic irradiation
Ultrasonic irradiation is a novel technology that can reduce the pretreatment time and decrease the energy utilization. It was reported that the use of ultrasonic irradiation causes the degradation of the cell wall and ruptures the bonds that bind lignin, hemicellulose and cellulose.107 In addition, it has been evidenced that the ultrasonic assisted chemical contributes to both external surface destruction and internal disruption of lignocellulose. The mechanism is mainly based on three steps: (1) rapid dissolution of lignin on the surface of lignocellulose by the chemical with the assistance of ultrasonic waves; (2) ultrasonic waves generate micro-bubble cavitation that provides energy to the surface of lignocellulose, mechanically breaking down the external structure and facilitating the penetration of ions into internal areas; and (3) dissociated ions permeate and interact with the cellulose chains, breaking down the intermolecular hydrogen bonds and disrupting the associations between cellulose and hemicellulose or lignin.108 During the ultrasonic pretreatment, the ultrasonic energy is finally dissipated as heat in the liquid medium, and the induced high temperature can lead to problems for the ultrasonic technology.109
Ultrasonic irradiation can be an efficient method to pretreat lignocellulosic biomass and enhance biomass utilization. The pretreatment capacity with ultrasonic waves was analyzed and identified and is summarized in Table 4. According to the collected references, the ultrasonic pretreatment mainly focuses on 8 types: ultrasonic, ultrasonic-water, -organosolv, -acid, -alkali, -ILs, -enzyme, and -TiO2. Considering there are many published studies, Table 4 provides only the types of ultrasonic pretreatments, the types of biomass resources treated and the significant results. A more specific description is given as follows.

The ultrasonic assisted water is used to pretreat Agave durangensis leaves. The results indicated that both the lignin and hemicellulose contents are significantly increased after pretreatment, and the hemicellulose content is increased more obviously than lignin.110 It was suggested that the effect of ultrasonic waves is exerted on the release of lignin and hemicellulose by the hydrolysis of the linkages between lignin and the carbohydrate.111–113
Zhang et al. used ultrasonic waves and sulfuric acid to pretreat corn stover and sorghum stalk in two steps.114 For pretreatment with only ultrasonic radiation, no significant difference in the lignin content was observed, indicating that ultrasonic radiation itself cannot alter the chemical composition of biomass. When ultrasonic radiation was combined with dilute H2SO4 to pretreat the same biomass, the percentage of xylan was reduced significantly from 24 to 2%. This illustrated that the ultrasonic assisted acid has a strong effect on the hemicellulose removal. According to the previous studies, HCl is more effective for lignin removal than H3PO4, HNO3 and H2SO4.115 The ultrasonic assisted HCl was further used to pretreat two Pennisetum samples at 100 W, 353 K with a duty cycle of 70%. Compared with that without ultrasonic assisted pretreatment, the delignification was increased from 33 to 80.4% for deenanath grass and from 33.8 to 82.1% for hybrid napier grass.
Ultrasonic radiation plus alkali can result in relatively high lignin removal. It was stated that the ultrasonic assisted alkali pretreatment has a significant effect on the cleavage of ether linkages between lignin and hemicellulose from the cell wall,116 or it can destroy the lignocellulose structure and help the alkali diffuse into the internal areas of lignocellulose to accelerate the degradation of lignin. 1.7–2.0-fold enhancement in the delignification extent was achieved by ultrasonic assisted NaOH for the studied feedstocks compared with that of NaOH only under the conditions of 20 kHz, 100 W, 70 min and 1 mol L−1 NaOH.117 Manasa et al. also used ultrasonic assisted NaOH to pretreat sunn hemp and obtain a cellulose-rich material (68%). The result indicated that the ultrasonic assisted alkali pretreatment has a better effect on the hemicellulose and lignin degradation than that of alkali pretreatment.118 Dong et al. investigated the effects of single-frequency and dual-frequency ultrasonic pretreatment combined with 2% NaOH solution for corn stalks, and it was found that more lignin, hemicellulose and cellulose were removed in the dual-frequency ultrasonic pretreatment, especially for cellulose.119 For ultrasonic assisted alkali pretreatment, the capacities of lignin removal follow the order ultrasonic-Ca(OH)2 > ultrasonic-NaOH,120 and ultrasonic-tetra-n-butylammonium hydroxide (TBAH) > ultrasonic-NaOH108 > ultrasonic-aqueous ammonia.121
In addition, organosolv (ethanol) pretreatment under harsh conditions (200 °C, 1% H2SO4 and a duration of 80 min) shows better delignification performances than those with soda treatment.122 The hybrid ultrasonic-H2SO4–ethanol and ultrasonic-H2SO4 + ethanol–H2O2 + NaOH were studied by Li et al.,123 and it was found that lignin was removed almost completely from wood together with good solubility of hemicellulose. Finally, the cellulose-rich materials with values of 88.43% for ultrasonic-H2SO4–ethanol and 93.18% for ultrasonic-H2SO4 + ethanol–H2O2 + NaOH were acquired.
Sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) is an anionic surfactant. The sonication effect in the liquid medium can be augmented using SDS in an ultrasonic field.124 Shanthi et al.125 measured the lignin removal rate using SDS combined with ultrasonic radiation for fruit and vegetable waste. The study showed that 72% lignin was removed after SDS-ultrasonic pretreatment under the conditions of 25 kHz and 90 W, whereas only 18% lignin was removed using ultrasonic pretreatment alone (24 kHz and 100 W) for napier grass.126 The better result for SDS is not only due to the increase of the cavitation effect of ultrasonication by the surfactant but also due to the delignification of biomass by cleaving the linkages between the lignin and cellulose complex. For ultrasonic assisted SDS-1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride (BmimCl) pretreatment, it was also found that the addition of surfactants to the pulp as the delignifying agents not only reduces the surface tension of the medium and enhances the cavitation, which may break down the a-O-4 and b-O-4 linkages between the cellulose and lignin, but also decreases the amount of lignin deposited on the biomass, which further induces the lignin removal.127–129 Based on the available studies, the lignin removal capacity of ultrasonic-SDS is higher than that with ultrasonic-KMnO4.130 Besides, the ultrasonic assisted fungal or Fenton's reagent also shows promising lignin removal performance. When coupling ultrasonic treatment with fungal treatment to pretreat birch sawdust, the lignin removal rate is about 4.94-fold for ultrasonic treatment and 1.49-fold for fungal treatment.131 Meanwhile, Fenton's reagent may preferentially degrade hemicellulose and lignin in biomass, while ultrasonic treatment can degrade cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin simultaneously.132
3.4 Electric field
Electric field technologies mainly focused on the electromagnetic field,151 pulsed electric field,24,152 electric field,153 high voltage electrical discharges,122 electron scattering,154 electrolysis,155 micro-voltage,156 pulsed electric fields and high-voltage electrical discharges have been studied.148,157 Pulsed electric field (PEF) pretreatment is based on the electroporation phenomena, including electromechanical compression and electric field-induced tension, where an external electric field is used to induce the critical electrical potential across the cell membrane.158 The biological membrane is disrupted and the semi-permeability is lost, allowing the passage of intracellular compounds to the surrounding solution.159 PEF causes lethal damage to cells or induces sublethal stress by transient permeabilization of cell membranes and electrophoretic movement of charged species between cellular compartments.160 The size and number of pores of the cell membrane are related to the strength of the applied electric field, and the membrane porosity is proportional to the strength of the applied electric field.158 The characteristic of PEF treatment makes it possible to extract various compounds from biomass without modifying the chemical composition of the treated samples.134 Ammar et al. indicated that the PEF pretreatment does not affect the chemical composition of grape pomace, but it leads to a drastic increase in permeability due to the appearance of pores in the cell membranes that can release some components to the extracellular medium.161 The lipid yield after the PEF pretreatment and extraction with ethanol can be four times higher than that for untreated cells.162 However, there are several disadvantages of PEF, such as the high maintenance costs, high operation temperature, and the decomposition of fragile compounds.152
The function of high voltage electrical discharges (HVED) is the electrical breakdown in water. The electrical discharges result in a generation of hot and localized plasmas that emit high-intensity ultraviolet (UV) light. Shock waves are produced during this process and hydroxyl radicals are generated during water photo-dissociation.148 All these processes damage the cellular structure and release biomolecules from the cytoplasm of cells after the fragmentation of the particles.163 Brahim et al. reported that HVED induced a partial degradation of cellulose. HVED-soda pretreatment was 4–8 fold more effective than the blank experiment. Under the harsh conditions of 200 °C, 1% H2SO4, 80% duration time and with HVED-ethanol, 70% lignin can be removed from rapeseed straw, more effective compared with HVED-soda (58%).122 A micro-electric field was also used to pretreat cow dung at 200 °C with 0.25 V cathode voltage, and 57.32% cellulose and 56.60% lignin can be removed from cow dung. Compared with that without voltage under the same conditions, the biogas production of cow dung and the methane content are increased. This can be explained by two reasons: one is that the hydrothermal pretreatment can remove hemicellulose and part of lignin; the other is that the microbes stimulated by the cathode voltage in the fermentation become more active. Therefore, the micro-voltage and hydrothermal pretreatment can effectively improve the lignocellulose degradation ratio.156
3.5 Hydrodynamic cavitation (HC)
HC has been reported as a highly energy-efficient and suitable method for large scale applications of biomass pretreatment.164 The cavitation phenomenon can be defined as the formation and subsequent growth and collapse of microbubbles due to the changes in pressure at constant temperature. Compared with the acoustic cavitation, several additional advantages have been identified for HC, such as simplification and efficiency besides the flexibility to vary the cavitation intensity by using different device configurations and adjusting the operation parameters.165 It was reported that HC is sensitive to temperature, and the suitable HC operation temperature is only from 30 to 45 °C. A higher temperature will decrease the intensity of cavitation and reduce the cavitation efficiency.23
The use of HC for the pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass was first reported by Kim et al. in the study of reed pretreatment to produce ethanol using orifice plates.149 Since then, various kinds of biomass resources, such as corn stover,166 sugarcane bagasse141,167 and wheat straw, were studied for ethanol and biogas production. All these studies are based on the orifice plates or venturi systems, except the last one168 that used rotational equipment (Fig. 4). As shown in Fig. 4, these systems are composed of a pump, a reservoir tank, pipes, valves and a cavitation device, plus pressure and temperature indicators. Based on the available investigations, the orifice plate can be highlighted and is associated with the non-recirculation of solids for avoiding the clogging problems, the high pressure decreases and consequently the loss of the high cavitation intensity.8
 Fig. 4  Schematic diagram of different hydrodynamic cavitation systems.8,141 
The mechanism of HC for accelerating delignification is most likely attributed to the cavitation from physical and chemical effects. The collapse of micro-bubble cavities generates enormous destructive forces to dissociate water molecules, and thus the generation of radicals like HO˙, HOO˙ and O2˙ oxidizes the lignin molecules to low molecular weight organic products and even carbon dioxide (see Fig. 4).141,169 The efficiency of HC gets affected by the parameters such as: (1) the configuration of the HC system, (2) the process parameters, (3) the characteristics of biomass, and (4) the presence of a chemical catalyst.
The results of lignocellulosic biomass pretreatment with HC are summarized in Table 5. From Table 5, it can be found the main effect of HC pretreatment is the removal of lignin and hemicellulose, increasing the cellulose content except for HC-NaOH-H2O2. The number of holes and the diameter of the orifice plate affect the lignin removal efficiency.170 For HC-NaOH pretreatment, the orifice plate with 27 holes and 1 mm D (diameter) is more efficient to remove lignin from sugarcane bagasse compared with that with 16 holes and 1 mm D, and this observation is consistent with the results by Thangavelu et al. with HC-enzyme pretreatment.170 Compared with different alkali-catalyzed pretreatments for sugarcane bagasse with HC (16 holes, 1 mm D) listed in Table 5, the lignin removal efficiency follows the order NaOH-H2O2 > KOH > NaOH > Na2CO3 > Ca(OH)2. In addition, temperature has an effect on energy release during the collapse of microbubbles,141 while the pressure mainly affects the cavitation intensity.171 The overall investigation of the above-mentioned four parameters can help in achieving an efficient pretreatment with HC.

3.6 Ionic liquids (ILs)
Recently, ILs and IL-based solvents have emerged as an effective system for the pretreatment of biomass. Ever since Swatloski et al. discovered in 2002 that an IL (BmimCl) is able to dissolve cellulose,175 numerous studies on the processing of cellulose, lignin or various kinds of biomass with ILs have been investigated. As ILs are potentially attractive “green” solvents,176,177 the merits of biomass-pretreatment with ILs can be summarized as follows: (1) ILs can be modified freely by the combination of various cations and anions to be suitable for biomass dissolution, (2) ILs show high dissolution rates for large biopolymers, (3) the biomass hydrolysis process can be improved after IL pretreatment, and (4) ILs and the dissolved biomass can be easily recovered after the pretreatment.178,179 However, the main drawback of ILs is the high cost.
It has been evidenced that the ILs with the cations namely imidazolium, pyridinium, pyrrolidonium, morpholinium, ammonium and cholinium and the anions that can form strong hydrogen bonds with hydroxyl groups, e.g., Ac−, HCOO−, HSO4−, etc. are promising for pretreating lignocellulosic biomass. The studied ILs can be grouped into five types: (1) dissolving lignin, cellulose and hemicellulose simultaneously; (2) selectively dissolving lignin and hemicellulose but not cellulose; (3) dissolving hemicellulose but neither cellulose nor lignin; (4) dissolving lignin but neither cellulose nor hemicellulose; (5) not dissolving lignin, hemicellulose and cellulose at all.180 The removal of lignin with ILs results from its depolymerization through the homolytic cleavage of α-O-4′ and β-O-4′ bonds, releasing aromatic compounds and enabling the lignin to be solubilized.181 Based on the survey and analysis of recently published work, the most significant performance for each IL or IL plus co-solvent pretreatment is summarized in Table 6, in which the references in each line are related to the order of combined cations and anions or co-solvents. The more specific description of Table 6 is as follows.

EmimAc is frequently used. It shows that 95% cellulosic materials can be recovered from chestnut shells.182 50–55% lignin can be removed from pine wood183 and 56% from corn stover.184 The combination of co-solvents or microwave with EmimAc has been widely studied. It was indicated that EmimAc-acid can remove hemicellulose and lignin,185 EmimAc-alkali has the potential to remove hemicellulose and lignin and increase the cellulose content,186 and EmimAc-organosolv can be used to remove lignin and increase the hemicellulose and cellulose contents.187–189 However, EmimAc-microwave can be used to increase the lignin content.190,191
ILs can be hydrophilic and hydrophobic. Williams et al. pretreated pine with a wide array of ILs and confirmed that the hydrophilic ILs with polar protic anions work better for biomass deconstruction than the hydrophobic ILs. Meanwhile, for most herbaceous feedstocks, a hydrophilic IL (EmimAc) increases the sugar content and decreases the lignin content, while a hydrophobic IL (BmimPF6) decreases the sugar content and increases the lignin content, and the increased lignin content can be up to 189%.184 For the hydrophobic ILs with the anions such as Cl−, mesy−, or OH−, the lignin removal capacities follow the order Hpy+ > Hmim+ > Hnmp+,192 BHEM+ > 2-HTEAF+ > DMEA+,193 and TEA+ > Hbim+ > Hmim+,194,195 respectively. For the ILs with the same cation of TEA+, the lignin removal capacities are in the order HSO4− (82%) > MeSO3− (20%).194,195 Four kinds of ammonium-based ILs with the same cation namely diisopropylethylammonium (DIPEA+) but different anions such as Ac−, propanoate (P−), octanoate (O−) and benzoate (B−) were investigated for the lignin extraction from coffee husk.196 The result showed that the lignin extraction yield was affected by the pretreatment temperatures and the choice of anions. At high extraction temperatures, the yield of lignin isolation increases for the studied ILs. For example, the lignin extraction yield at 80 °C is 24.3% for DIPEAAc, while it is 71.2% at 120 °C. Meanwhile, with the increase of the chain length or decrease of the acidity of the aliphatic anions, the dissolution and the extracted lignin yield from coffee husk are decreased, and the lignin extraction capacities at 120 °C follow the order DIPEAAc > DIPEAP > DIPEAO > DIPEAB.
The sole pretreatment method may have limitations in efficiency due to the multi-scale biomass recalcitrance. A system combined alcohol solution with the catalyst BmimHSO4 can effectively fractionate coir and poplar into high-quality cellulose-rich material and high-yield lignin with a delignification rate up to 98%. The catalyst exhibited a significant enhancement in the lignin extraction with a nearly 6-fold increase.197 The study on the ultrasonic and microwave assisted TBAOH showed that microwaves have a stronger effect than ultrasound waves.198,199 This is because the excellent microwave-absorbing properties result in vibrating TBA+ with a drastic interaction with lignin to cause the violent deconstruction. In addition, hemicellulose can be removed almost completely with EmimHSO4200 and AmimCl-methanol pretreatment,201 and the hemicellulose removal capacities for different solvents follow the order BmimHSO4/glycerol/H2O (94.2%)202 > EmimAc-HCl (87–91.15%)185 > BmimHSO4/glycerol/H2O (75.4%).202
Certain ILs have shown effectiveness in biomass pretreatment and delignification; however, most of them are not biocompatible and exhibit toxicity to the hydrolytic enzymes and microbes used in the biomass conversion and require an extensive amount of water to remove ILs after pretreatment.203 In recent years, the ILs derived from sustainable sources have been reported, and some of them have shown impressive efficiencies and lower toxicity. It was found that approximately 46% lignin in the native rice straw was fractionated after being pretreated with ChArg,204 and the crystallinity of cellulose and lignin can be destroyed with ChAc205 and ChLys.203,206 ChOrn207 can be used to selectively dissolve lignin or hemicellulose and lignin from switchgrass or sugarcane bagasse, and the lignin removal capacity of ChOrn is higher than that of ChLys. ChOrn/FeCl2 solution was used to pretreat sugarcane bagasse. The research showed that: (1) the FeCl2 with a concentration higher than 2% (w/v) can significantly increase the removal rate of hemicellulose; (2) the extraction of hemicellulose can be up to 57.3% at a concentration of 4% (w/v) FeCl2, providing a further increase of enzymatic digestibility up to 90.1%; (3) the good delignification capacity of ChOrn/FeCl2 reflects the values of recovered lignin from sugarcane bagasse.207 ChAc and ChBu can also be used to pretreat empty fruit bunches. The result illustrated that ChAc is stronger than ChBu for removing lignin and increasing the cellulose content.208 Socha et al. investigated the ILs derived from lignin and hemicellulose.209 Switchgrass, poplar, eucalyptus, corn stover, pine, and rice straw were used as feedstocks to prepare furfural, vanillin and p-anisaldehyde, and then applied to synthesize dihydrogen phosphate ILs. The results showed that these ILs can be used to remove lignin from biomass in the order p-AnisEt2NHH2PO4 (43%) > FurEt2NHH2PO4 (20%) > VanEt2NHH2PO4 (3.9%).
4. Biomass renewal utilization process
The main components of biomass are lignin, hemicellulose and cellulose. Lignin can be employed for power and heat generation in the paper and pulp industries as well as for other low molecular chemicals and derived-products. Hemicellulose consists of complex C5 and C6 polysaccharides, and it is valuable for the production of important chemical intermediates. Cellulose has a ribbon-like flat structure containing many glucose molecules, and it can be utilized for producing valuable low molecular chemicals, obtaining other important derived products and depolymerizing into biofuels.222
4.1 Lignin utilization
Various chemicals can be acquired from lignin, such as phenolic compounds, guaiacol, vanillin, formic acid, bioethanol, etc. Considering that the reviews with the focus on fuels and chemicals from lignin have been reported recently,223 the work on the low molecular chemicals from lignin was excluded in this review, instead, the overall situation on carbon materials, dye dispersants, bioplastics and aerogels was reviewed because of their high values.

4.1.1 Carbon/graphene/carbon nanotubes. 
Lignin is one kind of attractive carbon precursor because of its abundance, high carbon content, low cost and renewablility.224 To date, lignin-derived carbon materials, such as hard carbon, porous carbon, activated carbon, lignin-based carbon nanocomposites, bio-char pellets, graphene, carbon nanotubes, etc., have been reported as remarkable application candidates for energy storage,225,226 lithium-ion or lithium–sulfur batteries, supercapacitors and photocatalysts to realize the high-value utilization of lignin.
Carbon. 
Yang et al.224 successfully grafted melamine into lignin to prepare nitrogen doped hard carbon with the aid of a catalyst (Ni(NO3)2·6H2O) at 1000 °C as an anode material in lithium-ion batteries. XRD and TEM analyses demonstrated the co-existence of graphitic and amorphous structures in this hard carbon. The prepared anode exhibits higher reversible capacity (345 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1), higher rate capability (145 mA h g−1 at 5 A g−1) and excellent cycling stability than the samples without nitrogen-doping and catalysis, owing to the synergistic effect of nitrogen doping, graphitic structure and the amorphous structure. A new route to prepare hierarchical porous carbon derived from lignin using KOH as both an activating agent and a template was studied by Zhang et al.227 The obtained hierarchical porous carbon is composed of a unique 3D macroporous network with mesopores and micropores decorated on the carbon walls. This unique hierarchical porous structure provides high active surfaces for adsorption and storage of lithium ions as well as fast paths for the transportation of lithium ions (Fig. 5). The developed carbon was used as the anode material of a lithium ion battery, and it displayed a stable and high capacity (470 mA h g−1) after 400 galvanostatic charge–discharge cycles at a current density of 200 mA g−1. For the application of lithium–sulfur batteries, a lignin derived macro-/micro-porous carbon with oxygen-containing functional groups on the outside surface was prepared by a one-step carbonization/activation method and then combined with the sulfur loading at different durations (6 h and 10 h).228 The result revealed that the specific surface area of the porous carbon is 1211.6 m2 g−1 and the porous volume is 0.59 cm3 g−1. After 10 h sulfur loading, the composite delivers a high discharge capacity of 1241.0 mA h g−1 in the 2nd cycle and maintains a specific value of 791.6 mA h g−1 until the 100th cycle. This performance is much better compared with that of 6 h sulfur loading. An interconnected hierarchical porous nitrogen–carbon (HPNC) from lignin-derived byproducts was investigated for the application of supercapacitors.229 The constructed porous carbon displayed bowl-like nanostructures with hierarchical pore distributions and a large specific surface area of 2218 m2 g−1 through the combined hydrothermal treatment and activation. The HPNC-based supercapacitor has an excellent specific capacitance of 312 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and 81% retention at 80 A g−1 as well as an excellent cycle life of 98% initial capacitance after 20000 cycles at 10 A g−1 in 6 M KOH aqueous electrolyte. When using the IL of EmimBF4 as an electrolyte, the energy density of the supercapacitor was enhanced to 44.7 W h kg−1 at an ultrahigh power density of 73.1 kW kg−1.
 Fig. 5  Formation process of the lignin derived hierarchical porous structure and lithium ion storage in it.227 
Wang et al. used a one-pot in situ method to prepare lignin-based carbon/ZnO (LC/ZnO) nanocomposites as a photocatalyst for methyl orange.230 The synthesis pathway for LC/ZnO nanocomposites is illustrated in Fig. 6. It showed that the BET surface area of the LC/ZnO (139.53 m2 g−1) is much larger than that of pure ZnO (47.68 m2 g−1). LC/ZnO (≈ 6.38% lignin) photodegraded 98.9% of methyl orange under simulated solar light in 30 min and showed a 5-fold enhancement of photocatalytic activity over pure ZnO nanoparticles. In addition, the prepared lignin-based carbon has great potential to replace the expensive graphene in the field of photocatalysis.

Graphene. 
Graphene has gained tremendous attention in many fields because of its unique two-dimensional (2D) network structure with the merits of exceptionally high carrier mobility, low density, extremely large specific surface area, considerable mechanical strength and outstanding anticorrosion properties.231 There are two methods for the preparation of graphene at a large scale, i.e., oxidation–reduction and chemical vapor deposition (CVD). CVD meets the requirements of both large-scale and high-quality, however, the transfer of graphene is difficult. The solid carbon sources (e.g., derived from lignin) with metal catalysts were, thus, used to prepare graphene, in which less resource is needed and the operation is easier compared with the two available methods.232
Yan et al. investigated graphene fabrication with different carrier gases by using Kraft lignin as the carbon source with iron(III) as the catalyst at 1000 °C.233 It was found that the graphitization degree of Kraft lignin not only depends on the temperature but also the types of carrier gases during the heat treatment. Methane and natural gas as the carrier gases seem to accelerate the formation of multilayer graphene materials with a range of 2–30 layers, and hydrogen and carbon dioxide have an etching effect on the solid carbon species during the catalytic graphitization process, while the multilayer graphene-encapsulated iron nanoparticles are the main products in the case of argon as the carrier gas. The iron powders were used as the catalyst to prepare graphene from Kraft lignin at 1000 °C as reported by Liu et al.232 The result indicated that with a ratio of carbon source to iron of 3:1, the graphene fold structure was obtained after thermal treatment for 90 min. The graphene quantum dots (GQDs), which are highly desirable for e.g., bioimaging, biosensors, photocatalysis, solar cells and light-emitting diodes, can also be derived from lignin. Ding et al. reported a two-step method to prepare single-crystalline GQDs from alkali lignin.234 Ultrasonication was introduced to disperse the lignin in nitric acid aqueous solution, and then the dispersion was subsequently transferred into an autoclave and heated to 180 °C and kept for 12 h. The product was finally obtained by filtering through a 0.22 μm microporous membrane. Notably, the prepared single-crystalline GQDs present a hexagonal honeycomb graphene network and they are 1–3 atomic layers thick. The prepared GQDs have the features of bright fluorescence, up-conversion properties, long-term photostability, high-water solubility and biocompatibility, making them potentially excellent nanoprobes for multicolour bioimaging. In summary, the utilization of renewable biomass resources paves the way for green, low-cost and large-scale production of high quality graphene and allows for the development of sustainable applications.
Carbon nano-tubes. 
Carbon nano-tubes (CNTs) have attracted a great deal of interest due to their remarkable carrier mobility of 1000–4000 cm2 V−1, high Young's modulus of 0.27–1.25 TPa, excellent electrical conductivity of 104–105 S cm−1 and thermal conductivity of 3000–6600 W m−1 K−1 as well as high thermal stability up to 700 °C in air.235 They have desirable applications in electrochemical and biomedical fields. One cheap and easy method to prepare CNTs from lignin was proposed by Liu et al.232 In this study, Kraft lignin is the carbon source and iron powders are the catalysts. CNTs can be obtained after thermal treatment for 105 min at 1000 °C. Shi et al.236 studied the microwave-enhanced pyrolysis method to treat gumwood at 500 °C with silicon carbide as a microwave absorber to produce CNTs that are formed on the surface of bio-char (Fig. 7). These CNTs are grown from the pyrolyzed round particles without the use of specific catalysts, substrates and carrier gases.

4.1.2 Dye dispersants. 
Dye has been widely applied in industries including textile, rubber, paper, plastic and leather. It has been estimated that over 10000 types of commercial dyes with 7 × 105 t per year are being consumed.237 Dyes can be classified into various types, such as direct dyes, reactive dyes, disperse dyes, vat dyes, sulfur dyes, basic dyes, acid dyes and solvent dyes,238 and all of them are difficult to disperse in water without dispersants. Dye dispersants play an important role in the dyeing process. As early as 1909, studies found that the lignosulfonate in the waste liquor of a sulfite process could be used as auxiliaries in the processing of dye up-take.239 Since then, lignin-based dye dispersants have been attracting great attention with significant contributions to improving the dispersion performance, and this is because such dispersants have good thermal stability and are environment-friendly and renewable.
The lignin-based dye dispersants are mainly synthesized from lignosulfonate and alkali lignin that are the byproducts from the lignin industry.240 Qiu et al.238 and Zhang et al.241 indicated that the dark colour of the industrial lignin is the main obstacle for it being used as high value-added dyestuff dispersants. A UV/H2O2 whitening process was proposed to decolorize the sulfonated alkali lignin (SAL) by Qin et al. and the colour was faded by 50%.238 After whitening, the SAL was not only practically depolymerized but also disaggregated. It was found that the cleavage of phenolic hydroxyl and methoxyl groups as well as the weakening of π–π interaction in SAL contribute to its decolorization, and the colour of the polyester fiber stained with the modified light-coloured SAL (LSAL) is almost white, while that stained with SAL is earthy-yellow (Fig. 8).
 Fig. 8  SAL whitening and fiber staining.238 
Four lignin-based dye dispersants were studied by Qin et al.,242i.e., sodium lignosulfonate (NaSL), naphthalene sulfonate formaldehyde condensates (NSFC), SAL and hydroxypropyl sulfonated alkaline lignin (HSAL). The result illustrated that HSAL with the lightest colour is the best one with a dye uptake of 85.3%. The effect of the average molecular weight of HSAL was further studied by Qin et al.,243 and the HSAL with a molecular weight of 11020 Da has a better effect on the dispersive ability, higher temperature stability and higher dye uptake compared with other HSALs and the sodium naphthalene sulfonic (SNF) acid formaldehyde condensation. The study on the adsorption mechanism indicated that the fiber is expanded and many voids are generated during dyeing (Fig. 8). The dispersants with small size and high content of OHphen groups, such as AL or HSAL (8750 Da), are more easily embedded into fiber voids, increasing the adsorption amount. The dispersant with a high molecular weight, such as the HSAL (14830 Da), has a high adsorption amount but low fiber staining because the low OHphen content makes a weak hydrophobic and H-bonding interaction between the fiber and dispersant. In the study by Qin et al.,238 SNF has a minimum adsorption amount due to a linear molecular structure with a main chain of the aromatic ring that is difficult to embed into the fiber voids (Fig. 9).
 Fig. 9  Adsorption model of dispersants on fiber.243 


4.1.3 Bioplastics. 
Lignin-based recyclable plastics have been paid great attention as an active field in recent years. They can compete with the petroleum-based plastics in both cost and performance.244 Lignin has the potential to be a remarkable candidate mostly because of its glass transition temperatures (Tg) (normally in the range from 90 to 170 °C)245 as well as its renewable and thermoplastic characteristics. Usually, two branches of lignin can be used, one is as a low-cost additive to improve the thermal and mechanical properties of bioplastics; the other is to synthesize bioplastics from lignin.
Kraft lignin was used as an additive to modify the properties of wheat gluten bioplastics.246 The addition of 30 or 50 wt% Kraft lignin increased the extrusion dye temperature from 80 to 110 °C, the addition of 10–50 wt% Kraft lignin improved the extrusion ability of wheat gluten, and the addition of 10–30 wt% Kraft lignin improved the mechanical properties and reduced the water adsorption of wheat gluten bioplastics. Two types of lignin obtained from softwood and hardwood were used to manufacture polylactic acid (PLA)-lignin bioplastics.247 According to the analysis results, the addition of lignin increases the thermal stability, mechanical properties, water sorption capacity and weathering ability of the PLA-lignin bioplastics.
The content of lignin is in the range of 30–45 wt% in black liquor. Ház et al. prepared lignin from black liquor and studied its properties.248 The result showed that the lignin isolated from the black liquor has great potential to be used as a component for new bioplastic preparation. Efforts were also made to introduce hardwood Kraft pulp in plastic composites such as polypropylene with the aim of producing bio-based materials with desirable mechanical characteristics.249 It was found that 10% lignin in the composite decreases the flexural strength (30.57 MPa) while 30% lignin increases the flexural strength (40.37 MPa), meanwhile, the degradation temperature increases from 360.16 to 415.15 °C with increasing lignin content.
Lignin contains various functional groups, such as aliphatic and phenolic hydroxyl, methoxyl, carbonyl and carboxyl moieties. These reactive groups have effectively enabled the preparation of lignin-derived bioplastics. The lignin modified by the fractionation with solvents and the crosslinking reaction with formaldehyde was used to develop lignin-polybutadiene thermoplastics.250 The crosslinking increases the molecular weight (Mn = 31000 g mol−1) whereas that of the as-received lignin is only 1840 g mol−1. Tuning the molecular weight of lignin enables a successful preparation of novel lignin-derived thermoplastics. The use of high molecular weight lignin enhances the shear modulus due to an efficient network formation of telechelic polybutadiene bridges.
Poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) is one of the main biodegradable polymers in the current and emerging bioplastics markets. The renewable high-performance polyurethane bioplastics derived from lignin-poly(ε-caprolactone) were investigated by Zhang et al.251 The synthesis route of Lignin-PCL Polyurethane (LPU) is illustrated in Fig. 10. The mechanical properties of a LPU plastic can be effectively controlled by adjusting the lignin content, the ratio of –NCO/–OH and the molecular weight of PCL. The properties of LPU are also dependent on their network architecture. The LPU plastic has a better thermal stability compared with the purified lignin. The tensile strength, breaking elongation and tear strength of the LPU film can reach 19.35 MPa, 188.36% and 38.94 kN m−1, respectively, when the lignin content is up to 37.3%. Moreover, this plastic is very stable at 340.8 °C and presents excellent solvent-resistance.

A series of renewable triphenylmethane-type polyphenols (TPs) were synthesized from lignin-derived guaiacols (methylguaiacol and propylguaiacol) and aldehydes (4-hydroxybenzaldehyde, vanillin, and syringaldehyde) (Fig. 11).252 The network exhibits an excellent glassy modulus (12.3 GPa) and a glass transition temperature (167 °C). Such study widens the synthesis route of fully bio-based polyphenols, which can yield renewable thermoplastics with excellent properties.

4.1.4 Aerogels. 
Aerogels are a class of open-cell and mesoporous foams with special physical and chemical properties. Up to 99.9% ultra-porosities, extremely large pore-volumes or internal void spaces, exceptional low densities and very high surface area-to-mass ratios are the features that make aerogels unique among other solid materials. In addition, the porous texture of aerogels can be easily controlled by adjusting the fabrication conditions during the sol–gel synthesis and the subsequent drying steps. Moreover, aerogels can be fabricated in various forms, such as monoliths, particles, powders, composite blankets and thin films, being another major interest in commercial utilizations.253
Aerogels are formed by controlling the extraction of liquid from the capillary voids of wet gels or hydrogels using the supercritical fluid extraction drying technique. The major challenges are the cost ineffective larger-scale production, expensive and toxic precursors as well as the time-consuming production processes. To reduce the cost, several strategies have been proposed to simplify the manufacturing processes, for example, freeze-drying and ambient pressure drying as the alternatives to the supercritical drying.
Recently, the novel precursor, biomass, has attracted great interest in terms of reducing the cost for manufacturing aerogels because of its inexpensive, nontoxic, and renewable nature.254 The lignin-based aerogels have a unique three-dimensional network structure and excellent properties, such as lightweight, low density and high specific surface area, making them attractive materials for applications in adsorbents,255 electromagnetic interference shielding,231 supercapacitors,256,257 supercapacitor electrodes,258 scaffolds,259etc. The properties and applications of the lignin or lignin modified aerogels are given in Table 7, and a more detailed description is given as follows.

Chen et al. prepared a lignin-modified graphene aerogel from the precursor of corncob lignin and graphene oxide. A 3D framework porous structure was acquired by the freeze-drying method. This prepared aerogel has a specific surface area of 270 m2 g−1 and 95.4% porosity, showing remarkable properties as an adsorbent. The adsorption capacity can reach 350 times its own weight when using it for the adsorption of petroleum oils or toxic solvents such as toluene, chloroform and carbon tetrachloride. This result is superior to that of a graphene aerogel and among the highest in the reported adsorbents.255 Alkali lignin and graphene oxide were used to prepare an ultralight and highly elastic reduced graphene oxide and lignin-derived carbon composite aerogel.231 This aerogel has aligned micron-sized pores and cell walls with the application of electromagnetic interference shielding. A small fraction of lignin-derived carbon cell walls enhances the interfacial polarization effect, greatly boosting the wave adsorption capability of the cell walls. The electromagnetic interference shielding effectiveness for the studied aerogel is 21.3–49.2 dB, and the surface-specific shielding effectiveness is 53250 dB cm2 g−1. This result is better than other reported carbon- and metal-based shields. Alkali lignin/CuCl2·6H2O,256 Kraft and organosolv lignin257 as well as crop waste lignin258 were used to prepare aerogels for the application of supercapacitors. It was indicated that the Cu-doped lignin-based carbon aerogels have a larger specific surface area of 899 m2 g−1 than other three aerogels and exhibit a specific capacitance of 257.65 F g−1. The specific capacitance remains 95% after 2000 cycles at the current density of 20 A g−1. These findings show a potential application of carbon aerogels in energy storage. In addition, Wang et al. fabricated a lignin aerogel for the application of sound-adsorption and thermal insulation.259 Lignin (90%) and cellulose (10%) were dissolved in ILs and simply regenerated in deionized water, causing the assembly of cellulose and lignin at the micro- and nanoscale and even at the molecular level. The resulting lignin aerogels exhibit Young's modulus up to 5.9 MPa, highly efficient sound-adsorption and excellent thermal insulation (0.138 W m−1 K−1). Moreover, lignin shows potential for application in scaffolds. The aerogel fabricated from wheat straw lignin and sodium alginate by supercritical drying was studied by Quraishi et al.260 The results illustrated that the alginate-lignin aerogels are non-cytotoxic, making them attractive as the candidates for a wide range of applications including tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.

4.2 Cellulose utilization
This section provides several high value-added applications of cellulose mostly based on bio-derived ILs from cellulose, functional cellulose composites as well as adsorbent materials, carbon and aerogels prepared from cellulose.

4.2.1 Cellulose-based ionic liquids. 
Cellulose is a versatile and low-cost sustainable material that undergoes chemical changes primarily due to its hydroxyl groups.261 It was also found that cellulose imparts surface characteristics and then increases total sorbent uptake with a 4 to 8-fold improvement in uptake per gram IL for the solid ILs. This offers the potential to drastically reduce the amount of IL required to separate a given gas volume.262 Bernard et al. studied the CO2 capture potential by the modified cellulose based ILs. These modified cellulose based ILs were prepared in two stages. The first stage was the modification with citric acid, and the second one was the attachment of the cationic moiety (Fig. 12 left). Among the studied ILs, CL-TBA is the best one for CO2 sorption in this study with 71 mgCO2 g−1 at 3 MPa and 25 °C. At low pressures, this compound presents a high CO2 sorption value (44 mg CO2 per g at 0.1 MPa). It was explained that the weakly coordinated counter-cations of the modified cellulose stabilize the system and maintain the CO2 binding sites of the anion via partially or fully non-occupied sites, improving the CO2-philicity of the ionic compound.261 Later, using the cellulose extracted from rice husk, the cationic cellulosic poly(ionic liquids) (PILs) were further studied for CO2 capture by Bernard et al.263Fig. 13 depicts the cations namely imidazolium and ammonium combined with different counter anions (Cl−, BF4−, PF6− or bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide TF2N−) to fabricate cellulose based ILs. The synthesized PILs have a high CO2 sorption capacity that is directly influenced by the anion. At 3 MPa of CO2 partial pressure, the sorption capacity follows the order Cl− < BF4− < TF2N− < PF6−. The best capture value was found for the PIL CelEt3NPF6 of 38 mg g−1 at 0.1 MPa and 168 mg g−1 at 3 MPa at 25 °C. The recycling experiments of CO2 capture demonstrated a good reusability of the synthesized PILs for CO2 sorption.

Cellulose-based ILs were synthesized and used as adsorbents for highly selective recovery of gold reported by Guo et al.264 In this study, diethylaminoethyl cellulose was used as the main raw material. The nitrogen atom of the diethylaminoethyl cellulose grafting carboxymethyl group generates the cellulose-based IL carboxymethyldiethylammoniumethyl cellulose (CMDEAEC) (Fig. 14), which possesses a nanoscale particle size and good swelling ability. The result indicated that CMDEAEC exhibits a maximum Au(III) adsorption of 15 mg g−1 according to the Langmuir model. Additionally, CMDEAEC exhibits a fast adsorption rate, and the adsorption equilibrium time is 2 h. Regeneration studies reveal the good potential of CMDEAEC for reuse and show only a 4.1% loss in adsorption after 7 cycles of adsorption–desorption.

4.2.2 Functional composites. 
Biological composites are efficient and multi-functional materials, achieving optimal performance through a complex structural hierarchy and a relatively sparse choice of chemical constituents.265 Cellulose carries abundant hydroxyl groups, which can interact with the oxygen-containing groups. Meanwhile, the hydrogen bond interactions and the stirring force synergy result in efficient mixing of cellulose and the selected compounds.266 Using cellulose in composites is not only beneficial in an ecological way but also with technical and economic benefits.267
Cellulose based functional composites have attracted many interesting investigations with the applications of catalysts, lithium ion batteries, antibacterial materials, drug carriers, scaffolds, energy storage, etc. The precursors of these functional composites are mainly the cellulose combined with metals, metal oxides or carbon nanomaterials. In recent years, the precursors, composites, applications and the properties of the cellulose-based composites have been investigated and are summarized in Table 8. A ZnO nanosheet-regenerated cellulose film (ZNSRC) was studied by Zhou et al. to be used in photocatalysts.268 The SEM result showed that the ZnO nanosheets were dispersed on both the surface and inside of the ZNSRC. The best photocatalytic activity of ZNSRC is that 1.53 × 10−5 mol methyl orange was completely degraded in 50 min by using 1 g catalyst, which indicated that ZNSRC can be very useful for degrading organic dye wastewater. In addition, the cellulose composite catalyst of graphene oxide/cellulose microspheres-NH2@Fe3O4-H3PW12O40 prepared from cotton material was applied in the transesterification of highly-acidic Pistacia chinensis seed oil to biodiesel. Under the optimal reaction conditions (80 °C, methanol/oil molar ratio 12:1, catalyst 15 wt% (w/w of oil) for 8 h), a 94% biodiesel yield was achieved.266 Nanofibrillated cellulose was used to prepare a LiFePO4/graphene/nanofibrillated cellulose composite. This composite shows potential as the lithium ion battery electrode. Compared with the pure LiFePO4 electrode, the resulting composite (LiFePO4/graphene/nanofibrillated cellulose) electrode shows excellent mechanical flexibility and possesses an enhanced initial discharge capacity of 151 mA h g−1. Moreover, the composite electrode can endure the bending tests up to 1000 times.269

Microcrystalline cellulose functional composites have wide applications in catalysts, antibacterials and scaffolds. It was reported that the immobilized EstH/Fe3O4-microcrystalline cellulose is more temperature-stable with a prolonged half-life and higher storage stability compared to the EstH free form.270 For the antibacterial function, 97% and 98% reductions were found in the growth of antibiotic resistant bacteria such as vancomycin resistant Enterococcus faecalis and methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus using microcrystalline cellulose/wool keratin/Ag0 nanoparticles. This will promote chronic wound healing.271 For the application of drug release, it was reported that ethyl cellulose-MgHPO4 as a drug carrier can release up to 87% of its total loaded drug over a 90 min period.272


4.2.3 Adsorbent materials. 
Cellulose has strong sorption power thereby making it a suitable adsorbent either in natural or modified forms. Celluloses have been used as adsorbents for water, oil, organic solvents, metal ions, dyes, drugs, etc.275 A few examples of the types and the capacities of the celluloses that were recently published for the sorption of water, oil and organic solvents and for the removal of metal ions, dyes and drugs are presented in Table 9, and some have been discussed further.

The study of water sorption with bacterial cellulose grafting acrylic acid in the presence of N,N′-methylenebisacrylamide as a crosslinker and ammonium persulfate as an initiator was conducted by Luo et al.276 The results showed that the maximum water adsorbency is 322 ± 23 g/g-distilled-water. The adsorption capacity decreases with the increase in the concentration of salt. The pH value has a significant influence on the water adsorption performance, and the adsorbency increases as the pH is increased from 3.5 to 6.0, decreases at pH 7.0, increases again at pH 8.0, and then continues to decrease until the end. The increase of temperature results in a decrease of the water retention rate.
Oil-based effluent is categorized into two distinct types: free oil and emulsified oil. Free oil can be separated easily by gravitation and skimming off; however, it is difficult to remove the emulsified oil since it is more stable in the aqueous phase. It has been found that the functional groups on the surface of cellulose are efficient for oil adsorption.277 One kind of superhydrophobic 3D porous ethyl cellulose adsorbent was developed for the removal of organic solvents and oils from water, such as n-hexane, cyclohexane, heptane, octane, petroleum ether, diesel oil, dimethyl silicone oil, soybean oil, diethyl ether and gasoline.278 The results indicated that the adsorption capacity of the modified cellulose adsorbent depends not only on the density but also on the viscosity and surface tension. For the organics with low viscosity such as n-hexane, cyclohexane, petroleum ether, diesel oil, diethyl ether and gasoline, the modified cellulose needs only about 16 seconds to reach the adsorption equilibrium, while it takes about 26 seconds in the oils with high viscosity, such as dimethyl silicone oil and soybean oil. Owing to the low movement velocity of oil molecules with high viscosity in the pore channels of the modified cellulose, the solvation of the sponge network and swelling in the oil are relatively slower compared with the low viscous oil.
Heavy metals are the most hazardous contaminants in the chemical-intensive industries. These heavy metals can be easily adsorbed by living organisms. Usually, the cellulose surface needs to be modified in order to function as an efficient adsorbent.277 It was reported that the content and structure of the amine groups (NH2– or NH–) within the membranes affect the removal of Cr(VI) metal ions.279 An advanced green carboxymethyl cellulose-based adsorbent was prepared by the inclusion of thiosemicarbazide for the adsorption of Cu(II) ions from the aqueous solutions. The mechanistic study of Cu(II) adsorption through XPS and FTIR analyses indicated that the high adsorption is attributed to the presence of the electron donor groups such as nitrogen, sulfur and oxygen with high affinity for the formation of the complex with Cu(II) ions.280 The investigation of Barsbay showed that the enrichment of O–CO, C–O and C–N groups on the cellulose surface is beneficial for the adsorptions of Cu(II), Pb(II) and Cd(II).281 While for the Cs+ adsorption, the remarkable groups on the cellulose surface are NH2, O–CO and OH groups.282 Moreover, a low-cost cellulose-based IL that possesses a nanoscale particle size and good swelling ability was developed to increase the contact area for Au(III) sorption.264 The cotton fabric as a green biomass resource was used as a carbon precursor, and an iron precursor was implanted to create mesopores through a catalytic graphitization reaction. The pore structure of the nanocomposites was tuned by adjusting the loadings of the iron precursor, and the embedded iron carbide nanoparticles served as an active component for magnetic separation after adsorption.283 The results showed a selective adsorption of different metal ions with Cr(VI) > Zn(II) > Ni(II) > Cu(II) > Pb(II), and the adsorption capacities of metal ions follow the order Cr(VI) > Pb(II) > Cu(II) > Ni(II) > Zn(II).
Dye pollutants occur in many industrial waste-waters produced by a variety of industries, such as textiles, leather, cosmetics, paper, plastics and rubber. These dyes are harmful for living organisms even with short periods of exposure, making it very important to remove dyes from waste water.284 In dye removal, the operation conditions are different considering the dye characteristics, and the particle size of the used cellulose is much larger compared with those used for the removal of heavy metals and other ions. Typically, the interaction between the adsorbent and the dye particle is categorized as physisorption with van der Waals attraction.277 To improve the performance, a hybrid monolith of graphene oxide and nanocellulose fiber with a robust interconnected network was fabricated via an ecofriendly self-assembly method. The pore morphology and surface chemistry (such as hydrophilicity and surface charge density) of the monolith were improved, and the specific surface area and mechanical properties were enhanced about 4- and 5-fold, respectively, compared with the unmodified monolith. It was proposed that the strong chemical interaction, mainly hydrogen bonding, is the primary driving force for the formation of a hybrid monolith.285 The combination of phenolic resin based on tannin and CMC can also effectively improve the adsorption performance of resin with methylene blue due to a synergistic effect between the phenolic hydroxyls of the tannin and the carboxyl groups of the CMC.284 Their adsorption process involves intraparticle diffusion, electrostatic attraction and hydrogen bonding interactions, and thus it depends on the pH and ionic strength of the medium.286


4.2.4 Carbon. 
Carbon dots (CDs) can be easily passivated to achieve specific functionalities. They have some interesting properties such as high specific surface area, good biocompatibility, low cost and fluorescence properties.299 These properties make them remarkable materials in different areas such as optoelectronic devices, biosensors, photocatalysis, solar cells and bioimaging (e.g., in immunofluorescence).
The use of biomass to produce CDs can represent the advantages related to the high availability and low cost of the final material, in the case that the synthetic strategy does not require expensive material or elaborate experimental set-ups. Eucalyptus Kraft wood pulp cellulose was used as the precursor of CD through a simple method using sulfuric and nitric acid.300 The diameter of the quasi-spherical biomass-derived CD ranged from 1 to 3 nm with an average size of 2 nm, and a large number of different oxygen groups (mainly carboxylic acids) were detected on the surface. Considering that CD was obtained with a low cost method and that the used renewable precursor is highly abundant, this method can represent an important strategy to reduce the final cost for the production of carbon nanoparticles with potential applications in the areas such as biomedicine and photocatalysis.
A novel mechanochemical method was first developed to synthesize carbon nanodots (CNDs) or carbon nano-onions (CNOs) through the high-pressure homogenization of cellulose powders. The CNDs (less than 5 nm in size) showed spherical and amorphous morphology, and the CNOs (10–50 nm in size) presented a polyhedral shape, an onion-like outer lattice structure and a graphene-like interlattice spacing of 0.36 nm. CNOs showed blue emissions, moderate dispersibility in aqueous media and high cell viability, enabling efficient fluorescence imaging of cellular media.301
In general, hard carbon is composed of two characteristic domains: stacked hexagonally bound carbon sheets and micropores (nanosized pores), i.e., interstitial spaces of the stacked carbons. Some biowastes have been used as the starting materials for one-step pyrolysis at 700–1500 °C to synthesize hard carbons with a capacity of 300 mA h g−1 or even higher. Since sucrose contains cellulose and lignin, their chemically modified precursors are pyrolyzed to tailor high-energy hard carbons, demonstrating 250–330 mA h g−1 reversible capacity. The cellulose-derived hard carbons show a high capacity, and the pretreatment can introduce cross-linkages. It was found that the optimization facilitates the reversible capacities of 353 and 290 mA h g−1 in Na and K cells, respectively.302
Activated carbon has been used as an industrial material, such as an adsorbent. The carbon material directly derived from cellulose is a non-graphitizable carbon and can be easily activated. However, the yield is low because the chemical structure of celluloses contains many O atoms. Improving the yield is important for the preparation of activated carbon from cellulose in order to decrease the production cost. It has been reported that the addition of a flame retardant, e.g., guanidine phosphate, is an effective option. By the addition, the yield can be increased from ca. 12% to ca. 22%.303 Melamine sulfate is one of the chemicals having a flame-retardant effect on the cellulose, and it was added to improve the yield of CO2 activation reaction via doping the dual heteroelements. The addition of melamine sulfate results in the suppression of the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) specific surface area. For the CO2-activated sample with 30 wt%-added melamine sulfate, the BET is 578 m2 g−1.304
Graphene, a single layer of carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal lattice, has attracted a lot of well-deserved attention due to its high surface area and excellent electrochemical properties. However, graphene is easy to aggregate and has poor volumetric performance when used as an electrode material. Hence, the dense graphene-like porous carbon (GPC) with a hierarchical pore structure was fabricated from the sheet cellulose made by milling the bleached Kraft pulp. The preparation procedure of the graphene-like porous carbon is given in Fig. 15, and the features of GPC are depicted in Fig. 16. The results indicated that the unique pore structure leads to an increase of specific surface area up to 2045 m2 g−1, providing abundant storage sites and channels for electrolyte species. The gravimetric (353 F g−1) and volumetric (309.7 F cm−3) specific capacitances of the prepared GPC were obtained in the 6 mol L−1 KOH aqueous electrolyte with a current density of 1 A g−1, and the gravimetric and volumetric specific energy density of the prepared symmetrical supercapacitor with this GPC electrode was 120.1 W h kg−1 and 80.4 W h L−1, respectively, in an IL (BmimBF4) mixed with acetonitrile electrolyte. These excellent performances make this material potentially useful for diverse energy storage devices.305

4.2.5 Aerogels. 
Cellulose aerogel is a porous solid material. It is generally prepared in three steps: dissolving/dispersing cellulose or cellulose derivatives, forming cellulose gel by the sol–gel process, and drying cellulose gel while basically retaining its 3D porous structure.306 As the newly-synthesized third-generation aerogels, cellulose aerogels not only have numerous excellent properties as the traditional silica aerogels and polymer-based aerogels (such as high porosity (84.0–99.9%), high specific surface area (10–1000 m2 g−1), low-sonic velocity, low light refractive index, low dielectric constant and low thermal conductivity (<0.025 W (m K)−1), but also have other unique characteristics inherited from their feedstock (i.e., cellulose) including biocompatibility, biodegradability and hydrophilicity.307 In addition, the following advantages can be achieved by using cellulose as the precursor for the preparation of aerogels. (1) The reserve of cellulose raw material is inexhaustible and renewable; (2) the cellulose chain is rich in hydroxyl groups, so that no cross-linking agent is needed in the aerogel preparation process. A stable three-dimensional (3D) network structure can be obtained by intramolecular and intermolecular physical cross-linking of hydrogen bonds, thus making the aerogel preparation process quite simple; (3) the chemical modification of cellulose to improve the mechanical strength and structural characteristics of cellulose aerogels is relatively easy to accomplish.306
Cellulose aerogels can be divided into three kinds: (1) natural cellulose aerogels, (2) regenerated cellulose aerogels, and (3) cellulose derivative aerogels. The natural cellulose aerogels include nanocellulose aerogels and bacterial cellulose aerogels. Nanocellulose aerogels are prepared by ultrasonic or mechanical methods to disperse nanocellulose in water, followed by subsequent drying with or without solvent exchange. Bacterial cellulose is collected from static bacterial cultures and has a natural 3D network gel structure. After the removal of bacteria and other impurities and subsequent drying, cellulose aerogels can be obtained. From Table 10, it can be found that the natural cellulose aerogels have outstanding properties for applications in thermal insulation, and electrode and dye/oil/water separation. For example, the thermal conductivity of a bacterial cellulose-silica aerogel is down to 29.2 mW (m K)−1,308 the oil/water separation efficiency is more than 99% by cellulose nanofiber (CNF)-chitosan aerogels,309 and the capacitance of a MnOxNy/rGO/CNF aerogel as an electrode can reach 455.8 F g−1.310

Synthesis of aerogels is time-consuming because of the slow process of solvent exchange. Some cellulose derivatives are soluble in water and typical organic solvents.306 For example, CMC and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) are soluble in water, triacetyl cellulose (TAC) is soluble in dioxane/isopropanol, ethyl cellulose (EC) is soluble in dichloromethane, and cellulose acetate (CA) is soluble in acetone. Since acetone and some other organic solvents are soluble in SC-CO2, the time-consuming solvent exchange process can be omitted, thus improving the efficiency of aerogel synthesis.
Regenerated cellulose aerogels are currently being studied very extensively. The regeneration of cellulose aerogels has four main steps: cellulose dissolution, cellulose regeneration, solvent exchange and drying. Meanwhile, the modification that can change the physical and chemical properties of cellulose is an important way to functionalize the cellulose aerogels. The applications of regenerable cellulose aerogels are mainly based on wastewater treatment (i.e., metal or dye removal), organic solvent/oil/water separation, and CO2 adsorption. More details of these applications can be found in Table 10.

4.3 Hemicellulose utilization
To the best of our knowledge, the application of hemicellulose is still limited and much less compared to those of lignin and cellulose, and the review based on the hemicellulose application is also scarce. In this section, the hemicellulose application is mainly focused on films and pharmaceutical carriers.

4.3.1 Films. 
The formation of films from hemicellulose acetates was reported as early as 1949. The films from the renewable materials have numerous potential applications in the food and medicinal industries, such as food packaging, wound dressings and drug capsules.326 Hemicellulose-based films have become promising candidates for eco-friendly packaging applications because of their biodegradability and cost-effectiveness. However, the inherently poor mechanical and hygroscopic properties of hemicellulose-based films largely hinder their potential for target applications.327 By forming hemicellulose derivatives through functionalizing available hydroxyl groups or by forming blend films, the properties such as hydrophilicity and mechanical behavior can be modified.
An effective and convenient approach to prepare blend films with enhanced mechanical properties by the incorporation of CMC into quaternized hemicelluloses (QH) was studied by Gao et al.328 The blend film prepared from QH and CMC (1:2 m/m) has mechanical properties such as a tensile strength of 65.2 MPa, while it is only 18.02 MPa for a CMC film. This suggested that the addition of CMC enhances the mechanical properties by the strong electrostatic interactions, and the hydrogen bondings were enhanced with QH. In addition, chitosan was introduced into a QH/montmorillonite (MMT) matrix to produce nanocomposite films with significantly enhanced mechanical properties.329 The chitosan disturbs the regular arrangement of quaternized hemicellulose when incorporating into MMT due to the enhancement of hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interaction between two contrarily charged fillers. The QH-MMT-CS films even with a small amount of CS show an excellent tensile strength (57.8 MPa), which is 30.2% higher than the composite film QH-MMT. One hemicellulose-based eco-friendly packaging was fabricated by adding nanocrystalline cellulose (NCC) or cationically modified nanocrystalline cellulose (CNCC) to hemicelluloses (HC)/sorbitol (SB). It was found that the tensile stresses of the composite films with 9% NCC and 9% CNCC are 9.18 and 10.44 MPa, respectively, which are increased by 14% and 30% in comparison with that of a pure HC/SB film (8.05 MPa). This result strongly supports the conclusion that the addition of NCC or CNCC is effective at improving the mechanical properties of HC/SB films.327 In addition, polyacrylamide hemicellulose hybrid films were synthesized through the copolymerization of acrylamide (AM) monomers and hemicellulose initiated by the potassium persulfate/N,N,N′,N′-tetramethylethylenediamine (KPS/TMEDA) redox initiator system with the cross-linker N,N-methylene-bis(acrylamide) (MBA) (Fig. 17). All results showed that the prepared films possess many advantages, such as excellent water solubility at ambient temperature (dissolved in water in 116 seconds), low oxygen permeability (8.75–22.97 cm3 μm (m2 d kPa)−1), good mechanical properties (10.7 MPa, strain 120%) and great recyclability. This implies that it is an effective way to utilize the hemicellulose waste liquor, having both great economic and environmental benefits.330
 Fig. 17  Proposed synthetic process of the PAM-hemicellulose hybrid film and the corresponding chemical structure of the product.330 
Hemicellulose can also be used to prepare conductive films combined with carbon nanotubes (CNTs).331 The CNTs prepared by Shao et al. are double-walled carbon nanotubes (DWNTs), and HC is the commercial xylan, an extract from beech tree. The DWNT-HC conductive solution was dispersed using the ultrasonic method. The DWNT-HC films were deposited by either spin casting or drop-dry casting and dispersed on the pieces of a commercially purchased highly doped silicon wafer with a 300 nm thick silicon oxide insulation layer to form different thickness films. The DWNT-HC complex has the advantage of relatively easy dispersal in water. The bulk conductivity of the prepared films is up to 2000 S cm−1, much higher comparable to the pure CNT material. In the DC measurements conducted at low temperatures, a relatively weakly increasing resistivity of the CNT-HC was observed, showing that the material is close to the metal–insulator transition.


4.3.2 Pharmaceutical carriers. 
Environmentally sensitive hydrogels have enormous potential in various applications. In the pharmaceutical area, some environmental variables, such as pH, ionic strength, solvent composition, temperature as well as electric and magnetic fields need to be considered. Environmental changes in the body may occur, such as low pH and elevated temperatures. Thus, either pH-sensitive and/or temperature-sensitive hydrogels can be used for site-specific controlled drug delivery.332,333 The hydrogels that are responsive to specific molecules, such as glucose or antigens, can be used as biosensors and drug delivery systems. Peng et al.334 reported that the xylan-rich hemicellulose hydrogels expanded at high pH, whereas shrinkage occurred at low pH or in salt solutions as well as in organic solvents. The ionic hydrogels had high water adsorption capacity and showed rapid and multiple responses to pH, ions and organic solvents. Further study illustrated that the xylan-rich hemicellulose hydrogels exhibited highly efficient regeneration and metal ion recovery efficiency, and they can be reused without a noticeable loss of adsorption capacity for Pd2+, Cd2+ and Zn2+ after quite a number of adsorption/desorption cycles.335
It was reported that the hydrogels based on hemicellulose of wheat straw can be used as a novel carrier to control drug delivery.336 The prepared hemicellulose hydrogels are pH-responsive. The swelling kinetics of the hydrogels follows a Fickian diffusion process in a medium with a pH of 1.5, and the water uptake can be controlled collaboratively by hydrogel relaxation and water diffusion in the media with pH values of 7.4 and 10. With acetylsalicylic acid as a model drug, the release dynamics of the drug-loaded hydrogels shows a zero-order drug release kinetics for 6 h, and the cumulative release rate of 85% can be achieved. The release of theophylline from the hydrogels verified the controlling effect of the hemicellulose hydrogels. This study indicates that the hemicellulose hydrogels can be used in biomedical fields, especially for controlling the drug release.
A novel photoresponsive hydrogel prepared by free radical copolymerization of xylan-type hemicellulose methacrylate with 4-[(4-acryloyloxyphenyl)azo]benzoic acid (AOPAB) was investigated. It showed multi-responsive behaviors to pH, water/ethanol alternating solutions, and light.337 The swelling ratios of the prepared hydrogels in the distilled water decreased from 9.8 to 2.2 g g−1 when the AOPAB content was increased from 2 to 16%. The hydrogel displayed rapid swelling and de-swelling performances in water and ethanol alternating solutions. Additionally, under UV irradiation, the trans-conformation of azobenzene in the hydrogel generally converted into the cis-conformation and resulted in the hydrophilic/hydrophobic balance variation of the hydrogel. Therefore, the hydrogel loaded with vitamin B12 (VB12) showed a higher drug cumulative release rate under UV irradiation than that without UV irradiation.
Xylan, a promising hemicellulose, has been reported for drug delivery. One kind of maleic anhydride-modified xylan (MAHX), a pH- and thermo-responsive hydrogel, was studied for acetylsalicylic acid and theophylline release. The cumulative release rate of acetylsalicylic acid for MAHX-based hydrogels is higher than that of theophylline. Besides, in the gastrointestinal sustained drug release, the acetylsalicylic acid release rate is extremely slow for the initial 3 h in the gastric fluid (24.26%), and then the cumulative release rate reaches 90.5% after sustained release for 5 h in the stimulated intestinal fluid. Importantly, MAHX-based hydrogels have satisfactory biocompatibility with NIH3T3 cells.338

5. Conclusion and perspectives
Lignocellulosic biomass materials are receiving increasing attention as a renewable, economic and abundant alternative to fossil resources for the production of various high-value products. For the utilization of lignocellulosic biomass, the efficiency highly depends on the types of biomass resources with different contents, compositions and structures of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin. The cascade utilization is the best way because this option considers the composition, characteristics and the nature of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin.
The fractionation of biomass into its individual components with pretreatment is the first step to achieve the cascade utilization of biomass. The performance of pretreatment depends on the used methods and the subsequent target product, and each method has its own specific disadvantages. This makes it a challenge to choose a universal pretreatment method for all the commercial applications. The conventional techniques that have been used in an industrial scale will be restricted due to the strategic requirements of “green and energy saving”, and therefore development of eco-friendly, economic and time-saving pretreatment technologies is needed.
Based on the review on the emerging unconventional pretreatment technologies including microwave irradiation, supercritical fluids, ultrasonic irradiation, electric fields, HC and ILs, it was found that: the single pretreatment method has a limited enhancement of the fractionation efficiency due to the complex structure of biomass, the technologies assisted with co-solvents, catalysts or novel physical systems can significantly improve the pretreatment efficiency, microwave-IL is a significantly fast method to reduce the reaction time from several hours to minutes, and the SC-CO2/H2O/ethanol system can be used to acquire cellulose rich materials (up to 70%) and the lignin removal yield reaches 90%. In addition, the ultrasonication assisted single ethanosolv pretreatment can be used to obtain cellulose with a high purity up to 95%. Among the reviewed techniques, the efficiency of the electric field is the lowest, and HC has the potential to achieve a large scale industrial application to oxidize lignin molecules to low molecular weight organic products and even CO2. An IL as a green solvent shows remarkable properties for biomass separation and can be used to acquire high purity target products (e.g., 95% cellulose recovery) by designing its cation and anion.
The economic feasibility of the emerging pretreatment technologies is limited due to the high investment cost. The ultrasonication, microwave irradiation and electric field pretreatments need to be further developed.152 Supercritical fluids, such as supercritical H2O, have been used in the pulp industry, and CO2 and H2O at high pressures also show high potential.339 Hydrodynamic cavitation is an energy-efficient and suitable method for large scale applications.164 Developing efficient, low viscosity and inexpensive ILs as well as the corresponding IL-recycling technologies will accelerate the application of ILs in pretreatment.
The conversion of lignocellulosic biomass to fuels and chemicals is a promising alternative to replace petroleum as a renewable source. However, most of the proposed processes are currently unable to compete economically with the petroleum refineries partially due to the incomplete utilization of the biomass feedstock. From the aspect of cascade utilization of lignin, hemicellulose and cellulose, producing high-value and novel products from each component has been proposed such as (1) cellulose: converts into dissolving pulp for fibers and chemicals, (2) hemicellulose: used as a raw material or synthetic intermediate for bio-based films or pharmaceutical carriers, and (3) lignin: converts into carbon foam, bioplastics or battery anodes. However, it should be pointed out that most of the research on the lignocellulosic biomass utilization is still in its infancy, such as the functional materials of graphene, CNTs, bioplastics, aerogels, cellulose-based ILs and pharmaceutical carriers. Energy demand, capital cost and process efficiency are still the challenges towards the commercial scale application of lignocellulosic biomass. In the future, at least, the following aspects need to be considered.
(1) According to the composition, characteristics and the type of lignocellulosic biomass, integrating the merits of several pretreatment methods can be an optimal option to pretreat the lignocellulosic biomass.
(2) Classifying the lignocellulosic biomass types in an order based on the value of the products, and establishing a model of cascade utilization to enable a selection of appropriate biomass for a specific target product in order to improve the efficiency of the lignocellulosic biomass utilization.
(3) Establishing an integrated process with the consideration of the complexities of the biomass utilization process, inter-dependence of the pretreatment processes and the economy related to the market in order to maximize the conversion of lignocellulosic biomass into high-value products.
