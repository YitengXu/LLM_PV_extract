    First published on 12th November 2010AbstractIn the Dye Sensitized Solar Cell (DSSC) the dye sensitizer carries out the light harvesting function and is therefore crucial in determining overall cell efficiency. In addition, the dye sensitizer can influence many of the key electron transfer processes occurring at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface which also determine efficiency. Dye structure can influence and drive forward electron injection into the conduction band of the TiO2. Conversely, dye structure can help retard loss electron transfer processes such as charge recombination of injected electrons in the TiO2 with dye cations and also recombination of these electrons with the electrolyte. Therefore tuning dye sensitizer light absorbing properties and control of the aforementioned electron transfer processes through structural design of the dye sensitizer is an important avenue through which optimization of DSSC efficiency should be pursued. In this critical review the latest work focusing on the design of dyes for efficient DSSCs is revised (111 references).

1. Introduction
Modern society is heavily dependent upon energy resources and their continued supply is crucial towards long term global economic and political stability. The fact that these resources are still largely based on non-renewable fossil fuels such as oil and gas and growing public concern over the environmental damage that the use of such materials may be causing has encouraged the development and exploitation of renewable forms of energy. The abundance of solar energy which bathes the earths surface in 120000 terawatts of energy makes it extremely attractive for harnessing as a renewable energy source. Indeed, for many this is the holy grail of renewables. Single crystal silicon solar cells are currently the paradigm in solar cell technology achieving over 25% conversion efficiency in the best modules. However these cells are still too expensive for large scale production, even taking into account the high price of oil currently on the world market.

Dye Sensitized Solar Cell (DSSC) are currently the leading photovoltaic alternative to silicon based solar cell technology. They are attractive not only because of the possibility of harnessing solar energy providing a clean and abundant energy source but also because in large scale production their fabrication cost would be expected to be a fraction of that of the silicon solar cell. DSSCs consist of a porous nanocrystalline film of typically TiO2 nanoparticles (∼20 nm diameter) immobilized onto a conducting material which is sensitized to visible light through the adsorption of a monolayer of dye. The cell is completed by a liquid electrolyte, typically the iodine/tri-iodide red–ox couple in acetonitrile, and a platinum counter electrode.
A key difference between DSSCs and silicon solar cells is that light absorption and electron/hole transport is not performed by the same material. In DSSCs the light absorption function is fulfilled by the dye and the electron and hole transporting are fulfilled by the nanocrystalline metal oxide and electrolyte respectively. Therefore the absorption properties of the dye dictate the light-harvesting capacity of the cell. Moreover the dye will dictate the colour of the cell, which makes this technology architecturally interesting for incorporation into homes and buildings thereby performing an aesthetic as well as practical function. The properties that a dye sensitizer should have are the following:
-Anchoring groups such as carboxylates or phosphonates which are capable of covalently bonding to –OH groups on the TiO2 surface.
-Optimum absorption overlap with that of the solar spectrum for efficient light-harvesting.
-Correct alignment of LUMO and HOMO energy levels with those of the TiO2 conduction band and the iodide tri-iodide red–ox electrolyte ensuring efficient electron injection and dye regeneration.
-Capability of performing photocurrent generation over prolonged periods of illumination.

Fig. 1 shows the electron transfer processes occurring in a DSSC under operating conditions. Following the absorption of a photon of energy (1) the dye sensitizer injects an electron into the conduction band of the TiO2 from the S* excited state (2). This electron percolates through the film to the back contact where it travels through an external circuit performing work (3). Oxidized dye cations S+ are reduced by the red–ox couple (4) which is itself reduced at the platinum counter electrode (5). The possible loss mechanisms in the cell which are critical to cell performance are charge recombination of injected electrons with the oxidized dye S+ (a) and recombination of injected electrons with the oxidized electrolyte (b), or ‘dark current’.

Optimization of DSSC efficiency is being addressed in a variety of ways, for example through the design of different metal oxide materials with different nanostructures,1 or by the development of different electrolytes including ionic liquids2 and solid state hole conducting materials.3,4 This Critical Review, however, will focus principally on how optimization of DSSC performance can be achieved through structural design of the dye sensitizer alone. We discuss how design can impact upon the electron transfer processes occurring at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface shown in Fig. 1, namely electron injection, charge recombination and the dark current. We also discuss strategies to improve DSSC light-harvesting by the design of single sensitizers with broad absorption profiles and by sensitization with more than one dye (co-sensitization). Finally, we also highlight some examples where supramolecular principles have been utilized in the design of new sensitizers.
2. Sensitizer control of electron transfer in DSSCs
There are several excellent reviews covering the large body of experimental work on electron transfer reactions in DSSCs and the mechanisms underpinning them.5–9 In this section these reactions are discussed, in particular how they can be tuned through molecular design of the dye sensitizer. Several studies are highlighted involving most of the commonly employed sensitizer classes used in DSSC research today.
2.1 Marcus theory applied to DSSCs
In the study of electron transfer dynamics in DSSCs, Marcus non-adiabatic electron-transfer theory10 can be used. A quantum mechanical description of electron transfer is applied in terms of electron tunnelling from the donor to the acceptor through an insulating barrier. The penetration of the electron through the barrier will fall off exponentially with distance r: HAB2 = H02e−βr(1)where HAB2 represents the electronic coupling of the donor and acceptor and β is the resistance of the barrier to the penetration of the electron wavefunction. β is a property of the medium comprising the insulating barrier region and related to the height of this barrier. The rate of electron transfer (ket) incorporating this tunnelling description is given by Fermi's Golden Rule: (2)where FC represents the Frank–Condon factor which expresses the energetics of the donor and acceptor states. Though Marcus theory was developed to explain the rates of electron transfer in non-covalently bound donor–acceptor complexes in solution, it can also be applied to interfacial electron transfer involving molecular species immobilized on bulk semiconductor/metallic surfaces.11,12 In this case it is necessary to integrate eqn (2) over all possible donor or acceptor states on the electrode surface.
In eqn (2) there are four possible parameters which can vary (fixing T equal to room temperature) that can affect electron transfer: β, λ, r and ΔG0. The first two, the barrier height β and the reorganizational energy λ, are not easily controllable parameters. β is a function of the intervening media between the donor and acceptor and λ is largely dependent upon the polarity of the surrounding solvent environment. The second two parameters however, r and ΔG0, the donor–acceptor distance and the difference in their energies are much more amenable to change through modifications to dye structure. The effect of these parameters on several of the electron transfer reactions in DSSCs is discussed in the following sections.
2.2 Electron injection
Many early studies dedicated to understanding electron transfer in DSSCs were focused on electron injection from the photo-excited dye sensitizer into the conduction band of the nanocrystalline metal oxide. These and later studies showed ultrafast electron injection kinetics occurring on subpicosecond time scales for a variety of sensitizer dyes several orders of magnitude faster than emission decay lifetimes resulting in extremely efficient charge separation.13–20 Moreover, the kinetics of electron injection were found to be non-exponential in nature, which is attributed to a variety of factors including surface heterogeneity of the metal oxide, different sensitizer anchoring modes and injection from a variety of different excited states (i.e. singlet, triplet etc.). Ultrafast injection is often explained in terms of the strong electronic overlap of the LUMO orbitals of the dye and the acceptor states on the metal oxide electrode. In N3/N719 for example, the HOMO is located mainly on the ruthenium metal and –NCS ligands whereas the LUMO is located on the π* orbitals of the bipyridyl ligands. As these bipyridyl ligands are directly anchored to the electrode surface through the –COOH anchoring groups, photo-excitation results in a shift in excited state electronic density towards the metal oxide surface. The most efficient organic sensitizers also display this directional shift in excited state electron density towards the anchoring ligands and therefore good electronic overlap with the acceptor states of the metal oxide surface. Fig. 2 shows the chemical structure, optimized molecular structure and frontier molecular orbitals for the organic dye JK1.21 The HOMO is delocalized over the bis-dimethyl-fluorene aniline ligand whereas the LUMO is situated on the opposite end of the molecule with significant electron density over the –COOH anchoring unit indicating that photo-excitation of this sensitizer will result in migration of electron density towards the electrode surface.

While Ru(II) bipyridyl and organic sensitizers of general type donor–(π-bridge)–acceptor (see section 3) can effectively channel excited state energy towards the TiO2 surface, such directionality in the excited state for symmetrical porphyrin and phthalocyanine sensitizers is problematic. This is because the HOMO and LUMO of these highly symmetrical sensitizers (e.g.ZnTPP22, Fig. 3) are effectively delocalized over the entire conjugated π-ring system. Directionality of excited state energy and improved electronic coupling between these sensitizers and TiO2 can be achieved with unsymmetrical structures such as DPA–ZnP–COOH23 (Fig. 3) which when utilized in DSSCs shows an excellent efficiency of 6% with improved Jsc. In fact the structure of DPA–ZnP–COOH rather reminds one of the donor–(π-bridge)–acceptor structural motif very common for organic sensitizers today.24 In the case of DPA–ZnP–COOH one can consider the π-bridge to be in fact the porphyrin ring itself. Unsymmetrical phthalocyanine sensitizers have also shown higher efficiencies and Jsc in DSSCs than their symmetrical counterparts.25

The dependence of the rate of electron injection upon the distance and free energy parameters in agreement with Marcus non-adiabatic electron-transfer theory as discussed in section 2.1 has been investigated. Variation of the distance r between the dye excited state and the metal oxide surface was achieved through the use of spacer groups. Lian and co-workers26,27 varied this distance by employing –CH2– spacers for a series of three sensitizers Re(bpy(CH22)2n2nn(COOH)22)CO33Cl (n = 1–3) on nanocrystalline SnO2 films. Re(bpy(CH22)22(COOH)22)CO33Cl (i.e. where n = 1) showed ultrafast (<100 fs) electron injection whereas slower injection times were found with the other two sensitizers (19 and 240 ps where n = 2 and 3 respectively) showing a clear dependency of electron injection upon distance. (Interestingly, this study and others28–32 demonstrated that intimate coupling of the LUMO of the sensitizer and metal oxide surface is not a necessary prerequisite for electron injection to occur). Probing the effect of free energy ΔG0 upon electron injection can be done by either modulating the Fermi level of the metal oxide or by changing the red–ox potential of the dye sensitizer anchored to it. The former was done by Durrant and co-workers33 by incorporating an N3 sensitized TiO2 electrode into a three electrode cell and applying a bias and the latter as part of the study discussed above by Lian and co-workers26 by using a series of different Ru(dcbpy)22X22dyes where (X2 = 2SCN−, 2CN− and dcbpy) with different ground and excited state red–ox potentials immobilized onto SnO2. In both studies the rates of electron injection were found to be dependent upon free energy differences.
Large π-conjugated sensitizers such as porphyrins and phthalocyanines and organic sensitizers such as coumarines and perylenes have a marked tendency towards aggregation in solution and on the surface of TiO2 and this is one of the reasons why they have generally shown lower efficiencies in DSSCs. Aggregation can quench dye excited states resulting in lower injection yields.34–36 One way to avoid aggregation is to sensitize in solutions containing coadsorbates such as chenodeoxycholic acid37,38 which can help break up dye aggregates on the TiO2 surface leading to improved cell efficiencies. However, even in the presence of these adsorbates aggregation can still be a problem. In this case the need to employ sensitizers whose structures have been specifically designed to impede aggregation is unavoidable. Employing peripheral units bearing bulky side groups such as tert-butyl can effectively minimize aggregation resulting in higher Jsc (and therefore more efficient electron injection) and an overall improvement in cell efficiencies.25 Another strategy to reduce aggregation in phthalocyanines is to anchor them in a parallel fashion to the TiO2 surface using ligands which can axially co-ordinate the central metal atom. In this case it is necessary to use 5 and 6 coordinate metals such as Ti and Ru.31,32
2.3 Charge recombination of injected electrons with dye+
In stark contrast to the ultrafast nature of electron injection, charge recombination manifests itself as a rather slow reaction occurring on micro- to millisecond timescales and of a highly dispersive nature.18,39 The reason for such slow recombination has generally been ascribed to slow electron transport in the TiO2 film due to trapping/detrapping40,41 with lifetimes showing a strong dependence upon electron occupancy within the metal oxide.39 The effect of sensitizer molecular structure on recombination has been investigated in many studies. Addition of secondary electron-donating groups to sensitizer structure, increasing the distance between the dye cation centre and the TiO2 surface has been shown to effect the rate of charge recombination for a number of sensitizers.42–44 For example, Durrant42 and co-workers modified the porphyrin TCPP1 by substituting three of the –COOH groups for triphenylamines and observed a retardation in recombination dynamics by more than one order of magnitude (Fig. 4). Moreover, the shape of the dynamics change from stretched exponential to monoexponential indicating that recombination has moved from a TiO2 transport limited to interfacial limited regime.
 Fig. 4  Chemical structure (top) of porphyrins TCPP1 and TCPP2 and recombination kinetics (bottom) of these dyes on nanocrystalline TiO2 film. Adapted from ref. 42. 
The effect of free energy ΔG0 and distance r parameters upon charge recombination was also investigated by Durrant45 and co-workers. Charge recombination was measured for TiO2 films sensitized with a variety of sensitizers including Ru(II) polypyridyls, phthalocyanines and porphyrins. As these dyes have different ground state oxidation potentials (by up to 500 mV) free energy ΔG0 of recombination was varied. The different dye structures allow the distance r parameter to be modulated by several nanometres (estimated from HOMO/LUMO calculations). Recombination lifetimes show a clear dependence upon distance r with no correlation between lifetime and free energy ΔG0 observed. This study underlines the importance of dye structure for achieving effective charge separation in DSSCs: just as for electron injection where one should consider the LUMO of the dye sensitizer to achieve strong electronic coupling with TiO2, the cation centre on the dye sensitizer must also be considered to minimize charge recombination.
2.4 Charge recombination of injected electrons with electrolyte+
As discussed in the previous section, charge recombination for optimized DSSC devices is generally quite slow. In fact it is sufficiently slow to allow for efficient regeneration of dye+ by the iodide/tri-iodide liquid electrolyte. Of principle concern therefore is the recombination reaction between injected electrons in the TiO2 electrode and the oxidised electrolyte, or the “dark current”. Voc of optimized DSSCs could be as high as 0.92 V, as noted recently by Snaith,46 however optimized devices typically only achieve values of 700–800 mV. One key reason for this disparity is caused by the leakage of injected electrons into the electrolyte and is key to achieving higher efficiencies for these devices.
The molecular structure of the dye sensitizer can play a key role in minimizing the dark current. It can act as a barrier impeding this reaction by forming a compact monolayer on the TiO2 surface.47 Furthermore, amphiphilic dyes including Z90748–50 which contain long alkyl chains can block the approach of the charged oxidized electrolyte towards the TiO2 surface. DSSCs made from Z907 show improved Voc indicating dark current suppression. Alkyl chains have also been incorporated into the structures of other dye sensitizers to improve Voc.51–56
A curious phenomena is that DSSCs made from highly conjugated dye sensitizers such as porphyrins, phthalocyanines and organic sensitizers generally show poorer Voc indicating that dark current is a significant problem limiting the efficiency of these devices. Measurement of electron lifetimes in functioning DSSCs at open circuit can be used as a means of rationalizing Voc for different devices.57 Mozer and Mori58 compared electron lifetimes of DSSCs made with N719 and Zn porphyrin sensitizers and the shorter electron lifetimes for the latter were used to explain the roughly 150 mV lower Voc for these devices. O'Regan and co-workers59 compared electron lifetimes of DSSCs of N719 and Ru phthalocyanine and the electron lifetimes were also shown to be much shorter for the devices based on the highly conjugated Ru phthalocyanine. Mori and co-workers60 compared electron lifetimes in devices for a series of eight different organic sensitizers including donor–(π-bridge)–acceptor type dyes and indoline dyes compared to devices made with Ru(II) polypyridyl dyes N719 and N749 (black dye). In all cases the electron lifetimes were much shorter for the organic dye based devices than either the N719 or N749 based devices.
The correlation between lower Voc and fast electron lifetimes in functioning devices appears clear, however the reasons for this and the role dye structure plays in determining it is still under discussion. Even seemingly innocuous changes to sensitizer structure can have an enormous effect on cell voltage as demonstrated in two recent studies. O'Regan61 and co-workers measured electron lifetimes and cell efficiencies for DSSC devices made with two Ru(II) polypyridyl dyes, TG6 and K19 (see Fig. 5) whose structures differ by only two atoms (sulfur and oxygen). The re–dox and absorption properties of these sensitizers are essentially the same, however, devices made with TG6 show faster electron lifetimes and inferior Voc. This difference was explained by the difference in iodine binding of the two sensitizers with the oxygen atom of K19 inducing a lower binding constant than that of the sulfur atom of TG6. In another study by Reynal et al.62 the presence of electron-donating –NH2 in AR24a and electron-withdrawing –NO2 in AR27a (Fig. 5) has a detrimental effect upon electron lifetime, cell voltage and ultimately cell efficiency for DSSC devices made with these dyes in comparison to devices made with the reference dye AR20.

3. Sensitizer state-of-the-art
Since the demonstration by Grätzel and O'Regan63 in 1991 of the first efficient DSSC of 7% based on nanocrystalline TiO2, the best cell performances have continued to be recorded with Ru(II) polypyridyl dyes.64 The 10% efficiency barrier was broken by N365 (or its di-tetrabutyl-ammonium salt equivalent N719)66 and indeed this was the dyepar excellance for many years in the field. Ru(II) polypyridyl complexes have continued to evolve, becoming ever more structurally advanced in order to address some of their drawbacks when employed in DSSCs. Such drawbacks include their limited absorbance at longer wavelengths for which N749,67,68 or “black dye” (see section 4) was developed, or their long term stability for which amphiphilic dyes containing long alkyl chains such as Z90749,50 (see section 2.4) were developed. Another key issue is their limited extinction coefficients (N719 has an ε of 13900 M−1 cm−1 at 541 nm).66 This requires that devices are made using TiO2 films over 8 μm thick to efficiently capture all of the incident light. Thicker films result in both lower Voc (due to increased dark current) and lower fill factor (due to an increase in electrolyte resistance). To this end, a number of polypyridyl amphiphilic heteroleptic sensitizers such as K19,69K77,70C101,71CYC-B1 (Z991)72 and CYC-B1173 have been developed for use in DSSCs (Fig. 6). These dyes which incorporate thiophenes or phenylenevinylenes into the ancillary bipyrpidyl ligands show higher ε values (24200 M−1 cm−1 at 554 nm for CYC-B11), in addition to a shift in the onset of photocurrent wavelength to the red. Indeed C101 is currently one of the best dye sensitizers used in DSSCs with efficiencies of over 11% recorded.

Organic sensitizers24 are an attractive alternative to Ru(II) polypyridyls as they do not contain any toxic or costly metal and their properties are rather easily tuned by facile structural modification. In addition, they generally have much higher extinction coefficients when compared to Ru(II) polypyridyls, often higher than 100000 M−1 cm−1, making them excellent for use in solid state DSSCs utilising hole transporting materials such as P3HT3 or OMeTAD4 in which thinner device architectures are required. However there are a number of limitations regarding organic dyes including narrow absorption bands, aggregation, poor absorption in the red and poor stability. DSSCs utilising organic sensitizers initially showed very poor performances. However studies by Arakawa and Hara74–77 involving coumarine dyes and Horiuchi and Uchida78,79 using indoline dyes showed their promise so that by 2005 DSSC devices were already showing efficiencies of almost 8% with, for example, the sensitizer NKX-2677 (Fig. 7) and by 2006 Ito and co-workers 80 had achieved the extremely impressive efficiency of 9% with the indoline dye D149 (Fig. 7).
 Fig. 7  Chemical structures of coumarin NKX-2677 and indoline D149. 
Many more recent organic sensitizers have achieved efficiencies which closely rival those of Ru(II) polypyridyls in DSSCs.21,54,55,81–84 Indeed a recent study involving the dye C219 (Fig. 8) showed an efficiency of over 10%.85 These sensitizers all have the same structural motif in common, namely donor–(π-bridge)–acceptor where red–ox and absorption properties can be tuned by the judicious selection of the individual units. The most common donors used are arylamines while the acceptor is usually the cyanoacrylate group. The π-bridge often consists of one or more thiophene units. Molecular orbital calculations for these sensitizers have shown that the HOMO is located on the arylamine donor unit whereas the LUMO is centred on the cyanoacrylate anchoring group resulting in efficient electron injection into TiO2. Stability tests have found these sensitizers to be extremely promising for use in DSSCs.54,84

Porphyrins and phthalocyanines86 are also interesting candidates as sensitizers for DSSCs. They are highly robust, being both photo- and electrochemically stable. Moreover they are excellent light-harvesters with high extinction coefficients. Porphyrin absorption is centred mainly on the intense Soret band at 400 nm and moderate Q-bands at 600 nm. Phthalocyanines display an intense Q-band located at around 700 nm due to the smaller band gap for these highly conjugated π-aromatic systems. As discussed in section 2.2, porphyrins and phthalocyanines display certain limitations for use in DSSCs such as an inherent lack of directionality in the excited state for symmetrical structures and a tendency towards aggregation. Achieving better excited state directionality can be overcome by breaking the symmetry of these large planar π-aromatic systems and designing unsymmetrical complexes such as Zn–TP–(COOH)287 and TT125 (Fig. 9) which are currently two of the most efficient porphyrin and phthalocyanine dyes utilized in DSSCs with efficiencies of 7.1% and 3.5% respectively. In addition, substitution of Zn–TP–(COOH)2 at the β position of the porphyrin ring with the conjugated diethenyl linker and carboxylic acid groups results in a red shift in the Soret and Q-bands giving better absorption in the UV-visible. The staggered aryl substituents at the α positions of the porphyrin ring of Zn–TP–(COOH)2 and the bulky tert-butyl groups on TT1 help to minimize aggregation in these complexes when bound to TiO2.

Near-IR absorbing squarine dyes such as SQ188 (Fig. 9) are also under investigation as sensitizers for DSSCs. Similar to phthalocyanines they also show intense absorption bands but efficiencies have so far not greatly exceeded those of the phthalocyanines such as TT1.
4. Towards panchromatic sensitization
As already mentioned in section 1, one of the properties that an ideal dye sensitizer should possess is a broad absorption band with optimum overlap with that of the solar spectrum. The most efficient Ru(II) polypyridyl sensitizers are noticeably poor light-harvesters at longer wavelengths. For example, the incident-photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) of C101 ranges from 400 to 800 nm, only exceeding 80% from 480 to 660 nm.71 The development of panchromatic single sensitizers is however rather challenging as absorption of lower energy photons towards the near-IR means the sensitizer band gap will have to be sufficiently small. Such a small band gap may compromise other properties of the dye such as, for example, ground and excited state red–ox properties which are already tuned for efficient electron injection into the TiO2 and regeneration of the oxidized form of the sensitizer by the iodide/tri-iodide re–dox couple.
The first notable attempt to develop a panchromatic sensitizer for DSSCs was the Ru(II) polypyridyl dye N749,67,68 or “black dye” (Fig. 10) containing a carboxylated terpyridyl ligand and three thiocianate groups. The three thyocianato anionic ligands stabilize the excited states by electron donation to Ru causing the red shift of the MLCT bands by decreasing the π* level of the 4,4′,4′′-tricarboxy-2,2′:6′,2′′-terpyridine ligand and an increase in the energy of the t2g metal orbital. The resulting photovoltaic devices using N749 exhibit impressive near-IR photoresponse with an absorption threshold of 920 nm and a plateau higher than 70% between 400 and 700 nm. However the overall efficiencies of these devices are not significantly better than cells made with N719. More recently a new Ru(II) polypyridyl complex with the ligand 2,6-bis-(4-carboxyquinolin-2-yl)pyridine has shown 35% IPCE at 900 nm.89 Although overall efficiencies of devices made with this sensitizer are lower than for N749, to date this is the highest IPCE value reported in the near IR region for a Ru(II) polypyridyl dye. Panchromatic organic sensitizers are also being developed, for example the phenoxazine dye TH30490 (Fig. 10) which contains a thiophene π-bridge that extends the absorption spectrum allowing for a broad IPCE from 300 to 920 nm with a maximum of 67% at 580 nm. Although the final efficiency is only 3%, the extension of its light harvesting capability to the near-IR is very promising.
 Fig. 10  Chemical structure of dyes TH304 and N749. 
An altogether different approach to achieve panchromatic absorption of DSSCs involves the co-sensitization of two or more dyes with complementary absorption spectra. Porphyrins, phthalocyanines, naphthalocyanines, cyanines and squarines all display intense absorption bands at lower energies making them excellent candidates for co-sensitization studies since they show an optical window over a large region of the visible spectrum allowing them to be combined with sensitizers that absorb in this part of the spectrum. Despite the many studies present in the literature and though co-sensitized DSSC devices generally show improved light-harvesting, they also usually show poorer overall efficiencies when compared to reference devices made from the individual sensitizers alone. One reason for this seems rather straightforward in that there is only a finite number of anchoring sites on the TiO2 surface so any improvement in IPCE in one part of the spectrum by the introduction of a given sensitizer may be offset by poorer performance in IPCE in another part due to the removal of the other sensitizer dye(s). Another reason for poor performance of co-sensitized DSSCs is the deactivation of dye excited states due to energy or electron transfer processes between the different sensitizers.
In spite of this, there are some examples of successful combinations of dyes resulting in both increased light harvesting and improved cell efficiencies. In a study by Torres and co-workers91 involving the phthalocyanine TT1 and the organic dye JK2, co-sensitized devices yielded an overall cell efficiency of 7.74%, which was higher than the reference devices, with photoresponse extending up to 750 nm and with an IPCE of 72% at 690 nm corresponding to the Q-band of TT1. Wang and Zhang92 combined three organic sensitizers absorbing in different regions of the UV-visible: a yellow merocyanine dye (λmax at 380 nm), a red hemicyanine dye (λmax at 535 nm) and a blue squarylium cyanine dye (λmax at 642 nm). Co-sensitized devices showed a broad absorption from 350 to 750 nm giving an overall efficiency of 6.5%, which was higher than reference devices made with each individual sensitizer only. Co-sensitization of these three dyes resulted in reduced aggregation and improvements in injection efficiencies and photocurrent. Ogura and co-workers93 co-sensitized using the black dye N749 and the indoline dye D131 with devices achieving a power conversion efficiency of 11%, higher than the reference devices and indeed the highest for any co-sensitized DSSC. Keeping the different dye species isolated from one another by selectively positioning them on the TiO2 electrode was the aim of two recent co-sensitization studies. Hayese and co-workers94 co-sensitized nanocrystalline TiO2 with black dye N749 and the organic dye NK3705. Under pressurized CO2 conditions and controlled time, N749 uptake occurs faster than the normal dipping sensitization procedure, and so the dye occupies the upper microns of the TiO2 film. Subsequent dipping with NK3705 sensitizes the dye-free lower microns of the film next to the glass contact, producing a bilayer structure. The resulting device shows a broad IPCE curve from 300 to 900 nm, exceeding 70% from 400 to 650 nm, and an improved overall efficiency of 9.16% when compared to the reference devices. In another study Park and co-workers95 applied a column chromatography method to achieve similar selective positioning of dyes on nanocrystalline TiO2. The insertion of polystyrene into the pores of the TiO2 retards the flow rate of the mobile phase (the dye solution for adsorption and an aqueous solution of NaOH and polypropyleneglycol for desorption) and thus, allows the selective positioning of three dyes (an organic dye P5, N719 and N749) at different depths of the film. The resulting triple-dye-layer devices show a broad IPCE from 400 to 840 nm and improved overall efficiencies of 4.8% when compared to reference devices.
The problem of limited anchoring sites for sensitizers on the TiO2 electrode is a significant one for co-sensitization studies. Several strategies have been used to overcome this. One method is based on the controlled sensitization of TiO2 in which dye sensitized films are covered with a layer of Al2O3 and onto which a secondary monolayer of dye is deposited.88,96 The layer of Al2O3 has duel functionality: it allows for increased dye adsorption onto the TiO2 electrode and with the selection of suitable sensitizers with suitable re–dox properties it also facilitates the formation of a hole-transfer cascade in which holes are shuttled from the inner dye layer to the outer dye layer, increasing the distance between charge separated species and retarding charge recombination. The best results have been obtained using the sensitizer JK2 and a squarine dye SQ1 in the configuration TiO2/JK2/Al2O3/SQ188 whose IPCE extends from 350 to 700 nm and reaches 85% at 453 nm (absorption band of JK2) and 79% at 660 nm (absorption band of SQ1) and an overall cell efficiency of 8.65% which is higher than the reference devices.
Another strategy which tries to solve the problem of limited space on the TiO2 surface involves Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) from a “relay” dye to a secondary “sensitizing” dye which utilizes this energy to inject electrons into the TiO2 (Fig. 11). This requires the strong overlap of the emission spectrum of the relay dye with the absorption spectrum of the sensitizing dye for effective FRET. In this way panchromatic sensitization is possible with the relay dye absorbing photons at shorter wavelengths (the blue/green part of the spectrum) and transferring this energy to the sensitizer dye that absorbs in the red/near-IR region of the spectrum. Siegers and co-workers97 used just such a strategy by employing a dyad sensitizer which consisted of the organic dye Fluorol 7GA acting as the relay dye which is covalently linked to the Ru(II) polypyridyl complex [Ru(dcbpy)22(acac)]Cl that is itself attached to the TiO2 surface. Devices made with this dyad sensitizer show enhanced IPCE spectra when compared to reference cells consisting of the polypyridyl complex only. However only a negligible increase in overall device efficiency was observed. More recently McGehee and coworkers98 presented a novel design where the higher energy photons are absorbed by the perylene dye PTCDI which is dissolved in the cell electrolyte and undergoes FRET to the phthalocyanine TT1 which is anchored to the TiO2 surface (Fig. 11). The presence of the relay dye in the electrolyte allows for a full monolayer of TT1 to anchor to the TiO2 electrode. Devices made in this way show improved IPCE spectra when compared to reference devices with an increase in overall cell efficiency. The same concept has been applied in solid state solar cells with N877 as the donor and SQ1 as the acceptor.99

5. Supramolecular sensitizers
Supramolecular interactions involving sensitizer dyes immobilized onto nanocyrstalline TiO2 electrodes can be exploited in DSSCs offering further exciting possibilities for optimization of these devices. Despite this however, there are surprisingly few examples in the literature. The few studies conducted can be divided into the following categories: (i) dye sensitizer encapsulation by macrocycles, (ii) host–guest ion binding dye sensitizers and (iii) self assembly of dye monolayers onto the TiO2 surface via supramolecular interactions.
5.1 
          Rotaxane-encapsulated dye structures
Haque and co-workers100 employed an azobenzene based dye which was threaded through an α-cyclodextrin ring (Fig. 12a). The formation of this rotaxane was carried out in solution and the entire structure was then immobilized onto nanocrystalline TiO2 film through the cyclodextrin macrocycle. Transient absorption spectroscopy studies demonstrated that charge recombination is significantly retarded in TiO2 films sensitized with the encapsulated dye compared to films sensitized with non-encapsulated reference dye indicating that the cyclodextrin acts as an insulating shield between injected electrons in the TiO2 and the oxidised dye. Ko and co-workers101 also used this strategy to control interfacial electron transfer at the TiO2 surface. However in this study nanocrytalline TiO2 films were first pretreated with α-, β- and γ-cyclodextrin followed by complexation with the organic dye JK2 on the film surface resulting in the formation of a rotaxane stoppered by the arylamino moiety at one extremity and by the TiO2 particle at the other (Fig. 12b). DSSC devices made with β-cyclodextrin encapsulated JK2 showed increased Jsc, Voc and an improvement in overall efficiency (8.65%), when compared to reference devices made with JK2 only (7.42%). The increased Voc and efficiency were rationalised in terms of retardation of interfacial charge recombination processes and this was confirmed by photovoltage transient and electrochemical impedance measurements.

5.2 
          Host–guest ion binding dye sensitizers
It has been widely shown that the conduction band edge of nanocrystalline TiO2 is extremely sensitive to the presence of cations in the electrolyte. When these cations are adsorbed onto the electrode surface they shift the band edge positively and this will manifest itself in lower device Voc. Planells and co-workers102 aimed at circumventing this problem by designing the perylene dye PMI-1 which incorporates a Li+ coordinating crown ether into its structure (Fig. 13). Because this crown ether is positioned on the opposite end of the sensitizer structure with respect to the anchoring unit, the Li+ ions are trapped well away from the TiO2 surface. 1H-NMR and mass spectrometry studies revealed that the crown ether in PMI-1 did in fact complex Li+ ions resulting in increased Voc for DSSC devices made with this sensitizer. In a related study involving solid-state DSSCs employing OMeTAD as the hole-transporting material, Snaith and co-workers103 used the Ru(II) bipyridyl complex K51 (Fig. 13) containing polyethylene glycol chains to coordinate Li+ ions. DSSC devices made with this sensitizer showed an impressive 125 mV increase in Voc and an improved cell efficiency (3.8%) compared to reference devices (3.2%).

Falaras and Pikramenou104 designed the supramolecular host 1-α-CD consisiting of a Ru(II) tris-bipyridyl core with an appended α-cyclodextrin ring (Fig. 13). In this case the function of the cyclodextrin is to complex I−/I3− from the electrolyte within the macrocycle cavity thereby facilitating efficient regeneration of dye cations by the red–ox electrolyte. This dye was used in solid-state DSSCs employing a composite polymer electrolyte. Devices showed increased Jsc, Voc and overall efficiency (1.64%) with respect to reference devices (1.17%). The ability of 1-α-CD to complex the red–ox couple leading to improved regeneration was confirmed using solar cell devices containing low I−/I3− concentrations. Under these conditions devices containing 1-α-CD still showed higher Voc values in comparison to devices made with the reference sensitizer.
5.3 
          Dye
self-assembly
via supramolecular interactions
Biomimicry of energy and electron transfer processes found in nature such as those in photosynthetic reaction centres has received much attention.105 There are many examples of self-assembled donor–acceptor supramolecular complexes in solution involving dyes such as porphyrins and phthalocyanines as the donor.106,107 Supramolecular complexes have also been immobilized onto electrode surfaces.108–110 For example, in a recent paper Imahori and co-workers110 were able to assemble stepwise supramolecular arrays of porphyrin and fullerenes onto a flat SnO2 electrode. A maximum IPCE of 21% was recorded which compared favourably to other donor–acceptor arrays on electrodes.

Self-assembly of dyes onto nanocrystalline TiO2 surfaces via supramolecular interactions is extremely attractive for DSSCs as it eases the structural requirements on sensitizers as the need for anchoring groups becomes redundant meaning far simpler synthetic routes and purification/separation steps. In a study by D'Souza and co-workers111 a series of nitrogenous ligands covalently linked to a nanocrystalline TiO2 film were used to coordinate to a series of zinc porphyrin sensitizers which do not contain any anchoring groups (Fig. 14). These ligands co-ordinate the metal centres of the porphyrin sensitizers resulting in dye sensitization of the TiO2 electrodes. DSSC devices made from the porphyrin-ferrocene dyad complex (Fig. 14) showed modest IPCE of 37% at the Soret band of this sensitizer and an overall efficiency of 0.56%.

Conclusions
This review has been written with the aim of highlighting how targeting a single component of the DSSC, namely the dye sensitizer, can strongly determine overall device efficiency. That by subtly tweaking the molecular structure of the dye sensitizer electron injection can be improved or harmful electron transfer pathways such as recombination with the oxidized dye or red–ox electrolyte can be limited. Moreover, it is hoped that it has been demonstrated that dye sensitizer structure and consequently function in DSSCs are in continuous evolution, with the ultimate goal of optimizing device efficiency principally through the control of processes occurring at the molecular level.
The progress DSSC research has made up until now has been extremely encouraging. However, control of interfacial processes and maximizing light harvesting as well as resolving long-term stability issues will be challenging and will indeed take some time yet.

From Left to Right: John N. Clifford, Eugenia Martínez-Ferrero, Aurélien Viterisi, Emilio Palomares
	Dr John N. Clifford did his PhD at Imperial College, London (UK) under the supervision of Prof. James R. Durrant working on charge transfer reactions in Dye Sensitized Solar Cells. After several post doctoral positions in Italy (Dr Nicola Armaroli, ISOF, CNR, Bologna) and Belgium (Prof. Johan Hofkens, KU Leuven) he joined the group of Prof. Palomares at ICIQ as a Juan de la Cierva Fellow. His current research interests include the control of the charge transfer reactions in “molecular dye cocktails” on mesoporous TiO2 to achieve efficient panchromatic response in DSSCs.
	Dr Eugenia Martínez-Ferrero obtained her PhD at the University of Valencia (Spain) under the supervision of Prof. Eugenio Coronado working on molecular materials with optical, electrical and magnetic properties. After a postdoctoral stay in France in the group of Prof. Clement Sánchez (UPMC, Paris) she joined the group of Prof. Palomares at ICIQ as a Juan de la Cierva Fellow. Her work at ICIQ has focused on optimizing the properties of several semiconductor metal oxides to enhance DSSC performance as well as leading the work on hybrid light emitting devices (HYLEDs) in the group.
	Dr Aurélien Viterisi did his PhD at the University of Edinburgh (UK) under the supervision of Prof. David A. Leigh working on synthetic organic and supramolecular chemistry. Aurélien joined the group of Prof. Palomares as a post doctoral fellow under the FP7-EU project ROBUST and his work is focused on the synthesis of molecular sensitizers and the study of supramolecular assemblies to achieve panchromatic sensitization in DSSCs.
	Dr Emilio Palomares is ICREA Professor at ICIQ. Emilio did his PhD at the Universidad Politécnica de Valencia under the supervision of Prof. Hermengildo García. He obtained a Marie Curie Post Doctoral Fellowship to work with Prof. James R. Durrant at Imperial College London on charge transfer reactions in DSSCs. He returned to Spain to work as a Ramon y Cajal fellow at the Instituto de Ciencia Molecular-Universidad de Valencia and after a year he moved as an independent researcher to ICIQ. He has been recently awarded with an ERCstg fellowship (Polydot) and holds several awards including the Young Spanish Chemist Award by the Spanish Royal Society of Chemistry.
