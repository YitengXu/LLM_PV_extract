, Accepted 27th June 2023First published on 29th June 2023AbstractChemical warfare agents (CWAs) have been classified as fatal weapons of mass destruction because of their toxicity and deadly consequences. Among other CWAs, sulfur mustards (HDs) were employed during the Iraq–Iran war (1984–1988), causing significant fatal effects for 100000 military and civilian Iranians, and around 45000 people are still suffering from long-term health repercussions. Hence, the detection and detoxification of these acutely dangerous chemicals are critical for protecting ourselves and have thus sparked much scientific interest around the globe. In this regard, studies show that various photoresponsive porous organic materials like activated metal–organic-frameworks (MOFs), porous organic polymers (POPs), covalent organic frameworks (COFs), and TiO2-derived materials are highly effective for the photochemical detoxification of HDs. Given this context, we have traversed through the history of developing various photoresponsive porous materials and their efficacy in detoxifying CWAs, notably HDs. Moreover, we highlighted the numerous research methodologies reported to detect and modulate the excitonic effects in photoporous materials, which can tune the in situ-generated reactive oxygen species (ROS) responsible for HD detoxification. Lastly, we have listed the hurdles in creating photoactive porous materials and functionalizing them for large-scale HD detoxification. Although most of the described porous photocatalysts demonstrated good lab-scale performance, relatively few are accessible for large-scale industrial use. We have also addressed the future needs and potential for employing photoporous materials for efficient detoxification of HDs on an industrial scale to alleviate the issue of CWA/HD stockpiling and their potential use as a weapon of mass destruction.Dr Priyanka Kalita received her BSc from B.

1. Introduction
Chemical warfare agents (CWAs) are highly poisonous synthetic compounds initially utilized as devastating weapons by German troops against Allied forces during World War I.1–4 CWAs have the capability of causing both immediate and long-term injury to the eyes, skin, and human respiratory system.5 Disasters involving CWAs or toxic industrial chemicals are of particular concern due to their predisposition to inflict widespread illness and fatality.6 In 1993, considering the adverse effects, the use and stockpiling of CWAs were banned by United Nations members of the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC).7 The United Nations even declared CWAs as a weapon of mass destruction and nuclear and biological weapons.8 Despite worldwide bans, CWAs continue to pose a significant threat to humanity and are becoming an essential national security and public safety research topic.9 There are various kinds of CWA; amongst them, the most toxic ones are blood agents (cyanogen chloride or hydrogen cyanide),10,11 nerve gasses (sarin, tabun, cyclosarin, VX and soman),12 and blister agents (lewisite, sulfur mustard,13 and nitrogen mustard),14 etc. which pose a serious threat to humankind (Fig. 1).8 Blister agents or vesicant agents, for example, can induce enormous blisters when they come into contact with the skin, eyes, lungs, or any other mucous membrane.15 Sulfur mustards (HDs) are known as blister agents extensively used during the Iraq–Iran war (1984–1988).16 More than 100000 Iranian military personnel and civilians have been exposed to the HDs, majorly 2,2′-dichlorethyl sulfide.17 Over 45000 people are still enduring the long-term health consequences of HD.18

The three main areas of concern for chronic HD exposure are the eyes, skin, and respiratory system; however, long-term critical symptoms like cancer, neuropsychiatric, and immune system effects can also develop from exposure to HDs.18 Thus, multi-functional catalysts that can detoxify HDs efficiently on a large scale are widely needed to prevent the harm caused by HDs to humans. There are different ways by which HDs, specifically sulfur mustards, can be detoxified, such as hydrolysis, dehydrohalogenation, and oxidation (Fig. 1).9 Amongst them, hydrolysis and dehydrohalogenation are not efficient enough for practical use because of their slower reaction pathway.19 In contrast, oxidation to HDs can easily be performed under thermal and photochemical conditions, and both ways are equally preferred.20 However, the photochemical pathways under an aerobic or oxygen (O2) atmosphere are favoured over the thermal ones because of renewable energy sources and efficient reaction conditions.21 As a result, researchers worldwide have worked tirelessly to develop efficient photocatalysts for HD decontamination.22–25 Similarly, sulfoxides are organosulfur-derived important compounds extensively used in agrochemicals, the pharmaceutical industry, and chiral catalysis.26 One of the most feasible ways of synthesizing sulfoxides is via the oxidation of sulfides, which has been explored extensively.
Photocatalysis is one of the most recognized methods for the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) from molecular oxygen (O2),27 which can be used for a variety of applications like anticancer28 and antibacterial therapy,29 degradations of pollutants30 and other important chemical oxidation reactions.31,32 Despite the harmful effects of ROS on biological cells, the generation and detection of various ROS like superoxide anion radicals (˙O2−), hydroxyl radicals (˙OH) and singlet oxygen (1O2)33 from molecular O2 (Fig. 2) via photochemical pathways are extensively studied.34 The mechanism of singlet oxygen formation is typical of any kind of photocatalysis, be it with MOF-, COF-, POP-, CTF- or TiO2-based catalysts. Herein, under solar irradiation, the generation of photoexcitons (electron–hole pairs) in the valence band (VB) and conduction band (CB) of photocatalysts can initiate singlet oxygen formation. The photoexcited electrons in the conduction band maximum (CBM) of the photocatalyst reduce the molecular oxygen (O2) to singlet oxygen via a superoxide formation pathway. Molecular O2 is highly stable and accounts for around 20% of the air components. The triplet state of O2 (3∑g−) has two unpaired electrons on the two π-antibonding orbitals ( and ) with similar energy. The reduction of molecular O2 by the occupation of one of the π*-antibonding orbitals with one extra electron produces an ˙O2− radical. On the other hand, oxidation of ˙O2− can produce 1O2 (1Δg), where one of the π*-antibonding orbitals is occupied by one pair of electrons.35 It is well established that the overall energy state of 1O2 (1Δg) is higher than that of O2 (3∑g−) since it has to be generated through an intermediate. Here is the significant role of photosensitizers (PSs) or photocatalysts (PCs), which can efficiently harvest the energy from light and deliver it to the ground state (valence band) of the O2 from the excited state (conduction band) of the PS. The minimum energy gap for the PS systems must be greater than 1.61 eV to favour the 3O2 → 1O2 transformation from the thermodynamic point of view.36

It has already been noted that, among all other ROS, 1O2 is mainly responsible for the decontamination of HDs,37,38 and the generation of 1O2, particularly with higher concentrations in the reaction medium, is challenging because of its high energy requirement. To address this issue, extensive research is going into the development of porous photocatalysts such as porous organic polymers (POPs),7 metal–organic frameworks (MOFs),9 covalent organic frameworks (COFs),39 covalent triazene frameworks (CTFs), titanium dioxide (TiO2)40 and graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4)41 derived materials for the in situ formation of 1O2 followed by HD decontamination. Other than the porous materials, some supramolecular materials42 are also reported, which can efficiently perform the abovementioned reaction. Due to the toxic nature of HDs, thioanisole (TA) is employed as a model substrate for photo-oxidation to methylphenyl sulphoxide (MPS).43
After evaluating the TA oxidation potential, the efficacy of the photocatalyst was investigated on the conversion of 2-chloroethyl ethyl sulfide (CEES) to 2-chloroethyl sulfoxide (CEESO) or 2-chloroethyl ethyl sulfone (CEESO2). Fig. 3a distinctly suggests that after 2019 a rapid increase in the development of porous photocatalysts for HD decontamination reaction was observed. Additionally, the pie-chart demonstrates the contribution of different porous photocatalysts for the particular HD detoxification reactions (Fig. 3b).
 Fig. 3  (a) List of papers on photocatalytic HD detoxification and (b) pie-chart showing the contribution of different porous materials in this context. 
In this review article, we will primarily focus on the generation of ROS, particularly 1O2, by using different heterogeneous PCs for the selective detoxification of HDs. Most of the reports in this review published in the last decades are majorly concerned with photochemical ROS formation and detection by in situ techniques like electron spin resonance (ESR),44 and transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS).39 There are already some published review articles on the topic of photochemical ROS formation and detection by Nosaka et al.,34 degradation of CWAs45 using MOFs by Farha et al.,46,47 and by other research groups.2,48,49 Unfortunately, we have found no such review article particularly on 1O2 formation and HD detoxification. As a result, we feel that this review article will benefit researchers worldwide who are mainly working on photochemical HD detoxification using various porous materials. Different substrates and their two corresponding oxidized products after the photochemical oxidation using different photocatalysts have been provided in Table 1.

2. Photochemical decontamination of sulphide-based chemical warfare agents
2.1. Photochemical decontamination using metal–organic frameworks (MOFs)
MOFs comprises crystalline porous materials having metal ions interconnected by bitopic or polytopic organic linking agents through the formation of strong covalent bonds (Fig. 4).50 Materials with distinctive characteristics like a high surface area, highly porosity, and high crystallinity enable MOFs to expose or access active sites for catalysis and promote the transport of substrates and products. The MOFs’ structural versatility provides a fantastic chance to expand the light sensitivity across a broad spectrum range. MOFs have found applications in various fields like separation,51,52 gas storage,53 catalysis,54 drug delivery,55 degradation and decontamination of toxic CWAs,56–61 and other applications.
 Fig. 4  Generalized representation of metal–organic frameworks (MOFs). 
Using a porphyrin-based MOF catalyst, Farha et al. reported the photochemical oxidation of the mustard-gas simulant CEES. Singlet oxygen (1O2) is produced by PCN-222/MOF-545 utilizing a low-cost, commercially accessible LED light at ambient temperature and a neutral pH value. Without forming the highly poisonous sulfone product, PCN-222/MOF-545's singlet oxygen oxidizes CEES selectively to CEESO, the relatively harmless product. In addition to producing 1O2, the large surface areas and consistent porosities of MOFs can expedite the catalytic process and improve the adsorption of toxic chemicals. The porphyrin moieties in PCN-222/MOF-545 are segregated and heterogenized due to the gap between linking agents created by the three-dimensional (3D) backbone of the MOFs. This aids in removing the issue of aggregation and degradation that unbound porphyrin molecules in solution can experience, which frequently results in a decrease in the synthesis of singlet oxygen.62 The same group reported the detoxification of 2-chloroethyl ethyl sulfide, a model for the detoxification of mustard gas to nontoxic products using nanocrystals of porphyrin-derived zirconium(IV) (MOF) with half-lives (t1/2) of 12 min (Fig. 5).63

Again, to increase the singlet oxygen production, they also constructed NU-1000 material, which was developed by post-synthetically incorporating a fullerene-derived photosensitizer into a Zr6-based MOF and selectively oxidized sulfur mustard to the less hazardous CEESO with a t1/2 of only 11 min. Also acting as photosensitizers, the structural organic linkers in the MOF platform help the material to produce singlet oxygen when exposed to UV light.64 A pyrene-derived MOF, NU-1000, was also developed for the first time by Farha and co-workers for the detoxification of sulfur mustard CEES under ultraviolet (UV) illumination of a light-emitting diode (LED) to form a nontoxic CEESO product. The broad openings and 3D framework of NU-1000 enable the flow of substrates and products and further enhance the singlet oxygen formation by heterogenizing and separating the pyrene fractions in an ordered array. They proposed that, in the early phase of the reaction mechanism, CEES and 1O2 produce a persulfoxide intermediate with enough lifespan to engage in a nucleophilic addition reaction with an additional CEES molecule which thereby resulted in the formation of an unstable anionic hypervalent intermediate that later disintegrates into two sulfoxide products (CEESO).65 They also studied sulfur mustard simulant detoxification utilizing post-synthetically modified halogenated BODIPY ligand functionalized zirconium-derived MOF, NU-1000, for the enhancement of singlet oxygen production from MOF under the illumination of green LED light with a t1/2 of 2 min.9 Wang et al. reported a triazolobenzothiadiazole (TBTD) conjugated terphenyldicarboxylate (TPDC) moiety-functionalized UiO-68 isoreticular zirconium MOF (UiO-68-TBTD). The MOF material was used for the photocatalytic selective oxidation of HD under blue LED light irradiation to the much less hazardous sulfoxide product in the air with a t1/2 of 3 min. They suggested that their technology can operate more conveniently and practically when exposed to atmospheric air rather than pure oxygen (Fig. 6).66

Utilizing molecular oxygen porphyrin-derived MOF (Por-MOF) catalysts, Almeida et al. reported the selectively controlled photocatalytic oxidation of HDs, specifically CEES to CEESO, without the emergence of the highly noxious sulfone product CEESO2 (Fig. 7). They hypothesized that rather than the actual size and structure of the crystal, the ability of the photosensitizer to generate 1O2 seems to be significantly more connected with the oxidation of the HD simulant.67

Farha et al. demonstrated the photocatalytic oxidative destruction of CWAs via producing singlet oxygen by an effective photosensitizer, 2,7-disubstituted pyrene linker derived microporous MOF (NU-400), with a t1/2 of less than 15 min. They revealed a significant upgradation over NU-1000 material derived from the 1,3,6,8-tetrasubstituted pyrene moiety, demonstrating the alteration of photoactive behavior of the material with the substitution pattern of the linker unit of MOF.68 In another report by Gong et al. cluster-derived MOFs of porphyrinic silver-chalcogenide were used for the photochemical decontamination of CEES to CEESO in a very short time (5 min). The reaction was monitored via 1H NMR spectroscopy analysis, and the 1O2 formation was confirmed through EPR spectroscopy. The porphyrin unit here acts as a photosensitizer for the MOF catalysts, and the MOFs showed good reusability up to the 5th cycle.69
Parsons and co-workers reported Al-porphyrin-derived MOF (Al-PMOF) comprising Al(OH)O4, an Earth-abundant metal-derived cluster interrelated via H2TCPP (5,10,15,20-tetrakis(4-carboxyphenyl)porphyrin) chromophores, towards the photocatalytic oxidation of harmful HDs, CEES, through the generation of 1O2 to less toxic sulfoxides under the illumination of visible light (Fig. 8).70 Jianhong et al. reported uranyl nitrate ion-incorporated MOFs (uranyl-MOF) interconnected by carboxyl for the selective aerobic oxidation of sulfides under visible light illumination (xenon lamp) at room temperature for a time duration of 24 h to form sulfoxides. They proposed that the fundamental mechanism of the sulfoxidation process is an electron and energy transfer process of oxygen in uranyl nitrate ions.71 Luo et al. reported a weak supramolecular-interaction approach to develop ultrathin uranyl ion fabricated layered organic framework nanosheets for the photocatalytic oxidation of TA under irradiation of visible light (300 W Xe lamp) at room temperature for a time duration of 2 h. Ultrathin nanosheet samples exhibited noticeably increased photocatalytic oxidation activity of 4.5 times compared with their pristine counterpart.72 A triphenylamine-derived sensitive ligand, 4,4′,4′′-nitrilotribenzoic acid (H3TCA) embedded highly porous and stable Zr-based MOF (Zr-TCA), created by Zhao et al., displayed excellent catalytic performance towards the aerobic oxidation of sulfides to sulfoxides via the production of superoxide radical (O2˙−) under the illumination of light. Zr-TCA exhibited 100% conversion of sulfide with 98% selectivity towards sulfoxide in an open system using methanol as a solvent upon irradiation of blue LED light

for 10 h.73 Wu et al. described the synthesis of DUT-67(Zr), a zirconium-based MOF (UiO-66), for the photochemical oxidation of TA in the company of O2 on illumination with light, which resulted in a 95% conversion of TA with 98% selectivity towards the formation of methyl phenyl sulfoxide. They hypothesized that the large percentage of oxygen vacancies on DUT-67 accounts for the catalytic efficiency of DUT-67(Zr) being 10-fold greater than UiO-66(Zr). The Lewis acidity that the unsaturated Zr sites on DUT-67(Zr) own makes it easier for substrates to bind to generate coordination species, encouraging TA activation. When exposed to light, the surface complexes create electrons and active species. The photoexcited electrons produce O2˙− from O2 and facilitate the oxidation of TA.74 Farha et al. described the synthesis of multifunctional and regenerable N-chlorine-immobilized zirconium MOF, UiO-66-NH2 for the photocatalytic selective degradation of HDs, CEES having a t1/2 of 3 min to generate the less hazardous sulfoxide product (Table 2).75

2.2. Photochemical decontamination using covalent organic frameworks (COFs)
COFs are an evolving class of nano-porous crystalline materials having periodicity in their structural framework (Fig. 9).76 Precisely integrated organic building blocks construct the COFs into extended structures with ordered periodicity and specific pore distribution.77 From this point of view, COFs are exclusive materials because of their robust skeletal framework, higher stability, high surface area, and microporous nature. On the other hand, COFs offer a unique platform for studies associated with organic π-conjugated systems, where the micro-confined spaces inside a porous framework can trigger various interactions to produce excitons, ions, spins, and other excited molecular species.78 From the point of view of practical implementation COFs can be used for various applications like selective gas uptake,79 heterogeneous catalysis,80 molecular separations,81 proton conduction,82 carbon dioxide (CO2) capture,83 conversion84 and energy storage,85 etc. This article emphasises the recent advancement of COFs as photocatalysts to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) like 1O2 or O2˙− via O2 activation HD decontamination.
 Fig. 9  Generalized representation of covalent organic frameworks (COFs). 
In the past few years, researchers worldwide extensively studied COFs as photocatalysts for HD decontamination reactions. In the early stages, Chen and his coworkers developed a porphyrin-based COF via an A2B2 monomer, effectively showing sulfide oxidation to sulfoxide under visible light illumination. The control experiments with different radical and ion scavengers demonstrated the formation of 1O2 from O2 under photoirradiation, resulting in 98% sulfide conversion with >99% sulfoxide selectivity. This research enhances the design of appropriate photoactive materials and encourages the construction of innovative visible-light-harvesting COFs for sustainable and greener organic synthesis.86 Following this initial report, Bai et al. developed an anthraquinone-functionalized COF for visible-light-assisted sulfide oxidation and explored the effect of morphology and structure. The β-ketoenamine-based AQ-COF showed a nanofiber structure resembling noodles, and the staggered AB stacking model was efficiently utilized for the photo-oxidation of sulfides under metal-free aerobic conditions. In situ electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) analysis of AQ-COF with 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine (TEMP) under light irradiation produces 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-N-oxyl (TEMPO), which demonstrated an abundance of 1O2 in the reaction medium which efficiently oxidizes sulfides to sulfoxides.87 After that, for the first time, Wang and his team introduced two metal-incorporated porphyrin derived two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) COFs for the photochemical aerobic oxidation of sulfides to sulfoxides. Herein, the dimensionality (2D or 3D) of the two COFs greatly influences their functionality. From transient absorption decay curves, the 3D-PdPor-COF demonstrated a higher average exciton lifetime of 26.34 μs compared with its 2D-PdPor-COF counterpart, which showed only about 0.41 μs. Consecutively, the 3D-PdPor-COF showed enhanced sulfide photooxidation ability with up to 98% of sulfoxide yield (Fig. 10).88
 Fig. 10  3D-PdPor-COF demonstrated higher photocatalytic thioanisole oxidation efficiency than the 2D counterpart. Figure republished with authorization from ref. 88. Copyright 2019 Wiley. 
Alemán and his coauthors demonstrated that incorporating Pt(II) complex in an imine-based COF via a monomer truncation strategy can effectively enhance the light adsorption ability of the complex–COF composite compared with its pristine complex counterpart. Furthermore, the Pt@COF was utilized for the sulfide oxidation to sulfoxide under blue LED light irradiation and in the presence of O2 with a very high turnover number (TON) up to 8044 of the photocatalyst.89 Similarly, Jiang et al. demonstrated the photocatalytic activation of O2 by regulating the excitonic effects in a metalo-porphyrin-based COF. Interestingly, the formation of 1O2 or O2˙− from O2 can be tuned by altering the metal center in the COF framework. The incorporation of Ni produces O2˙−, whereas Zn can produce 1O2 from O2 under light irradiation. Furthermore, the variation in ROS formation by switching the metal center in the COF framework was proved by in situ EPR spectroscopy analysis. The production of 1O2 by DhaTph-Zn under light illumination was utilized for the photooxidation of sulfides to sulfoxides with ∼82% conversion and >99% sulfoxide selectivity (Fig. 11).37 A pyrene-derived COF (Py-Td) developed by Xiao et al. demonstrated high sulfide photooxidation ability compared with its other counterpart (Etta-Td), which does not have a pyrene moiety in its structural framework. The time-correlated single-photon counting and EPR analysis of both the COFs demonstrated a higher lifetime of excitons and better ROS formation ability in Py-Td COF, resulting in a better sulfide oxidation ability. Moreover, the Py-Td-coated fabric showed the photooxidation ability of CEES under an oxygen atmosphere, making it suitable for real-life application in the decontamination of HD.90

Another 2D porphyrin-derived COF (Por-COF) developed by Wang and his co-workers demonstrated the white LED light-irradiated aerobic oxidation of sulfides to sulfoxide. Introducing TEMPO as an electron transfer mediator significantly improved the photochemical efficacy of Por-COF. This is due to a paradigm of supportive photocatalysis between TEMPO and Por-COF. Under optimized reaction conditions, the Por-COF and TEMPO demonstrated up to 90% sulfide conversion and >99% sulfoxide selectivity. This work suggests that 2D COFs can offer a unique stage for building cooperative photoactive catalysts with a redox mediator.91 Another 2D C–C bonded truxene-based COF constructed by Liu et al. exhibited a visible light-assisted aerobic oxidation of sulphides having 100% conversion and >90% selectivity to sulfoxide via irreversible Brønsted acid-catalyzed aldol cyclotrimerization. The non-olefin-based C–C-linked 2D truxene-derived COF (Tru-COF) was synthesized via 1,3,5-triindanonebenzene (TDB) polymerization. The production of photoinduced radicals established by the solid-state EPR spectroscopy analysis of Tru-COFs under Xe-lamp irradiation makes it a suitable photocatalyst for sulfide oxidation.92
Zhao and his co-authors designed a hexakis(4-aminophenyl)-cyclotriphosphazene (HACP)-based COF (CPTPA-COF) for the effective photocatalytic generation of ROS from O2 under light irradiation. The 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrrole-N-oxide (DMPO) EPR spectroscopy analysis of CPTPA-COF revealed the formation of 1O2 or O2˙− under Xe lamp irradiation, which eventually resulted in efficient sulfide oxidation to sulfoxides with ∼100% conversion and ∼100% selectivity.93 Wang et al. discovered the enhancement in light-adsorption ability of Co(NO3)2-doped COF compared with its pure metal-free COF counterpart for photochemical TA oxidation to sulfoxide. Under optimized reaction conditions, pristine COF demonstrated up to 65% sulfide conversion with low sulfone selectivity. In contrast, the Co(NO3)2/COF exhibited up to 100% sulfide conversion with 100% sulfoxide selectivity. Moreover, EPR analysis demonstrated that the efficient and effective formation of ROS with Co(NO3)2/COF, rather than pure COF, during light irradiation improved its photoactivity.94 Zhang et al. demonstrated modulation in the electronic structure of triazene-based COF for the photochemical aerobic oxidation of sulfides with high conversion (99%) and high selectivity (99%) towards sulfoxides. Introducing electron-deficient triazene moieties into the COF framework enhanced the electron affinity and charge separation, which boosted the photochemical activity of the triazene COF. The production of different ROS (1O2 and O2˙−) in the reaction medium was established by spin-trapping EPR analysis with 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO) and TEMPO, making the triazene COF an effective and suitable photocatalyst for the aerobic oxidation reaction.26
Very recently, Li et al. developed another smart imine-linked COF (HP-n) by reacting flexible p-phenylenediamine and hexa-(4-formylphenoxy)-cyclotriphosphazene (HAPCP). For the first time, they have explored that the effect of protonation in the imine linker units during photoirradiation can effectively produce a higher amount of 1O2 under light irradiation. The protonation in the linker units can promote carrier separation, extend light adsorption, and cause protonation-induced skeleton rearrangements in the COF backbone. The production of 1O2 under protonation is established via EPR and time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) calculations, which eventually helped in the photooxidation of sulfoxides (>99% conversion) to sulfides (>99% selectivity) under an oxygen atmosphere and 10 W 420 nm LED light irradiation (Fig. 12).36

On the other hand, for the very first time, a chiral metal-free COF (S-DTP-COF-QA) was developed by Dong and his team for the visible-light-assisted enantioselective aerobic oxidation of sulfides in water to produce less toxic sulfoxides with higher enantioselectivity up to 99% (R) of (R)-methylphenyl sulfoxide. Introducing a specific chiral centre in the COF framework promotes the formation of one R-enantiomer of the product compared with the S-enantiomer under photooxidation. EPR analysis of DTP-COF-QA with the spin-trapping agent TEMP also revealed the formation of TEMP-1O2 adduct (TEMPO) under light irradiation, eventually converting sulfides to sulfoxide. Moreover, Dong and his team also carried out enantioselective R/S-modafinil formation, producing a biologically active compound with a chiral-specific DTP-COF-QA photocatalyst.95 In another report, Li et al. demonstrated the post-oxidation of completely π-conjugated benzotrithiophene-derived COF for photochemical HD decontamination. Herein, the S-atom in the benzotrithiophene moiety was oxidized using m-CPBA to produce an oxidized counterpart, demonstrating a higher light-harvesting ability, better charge separation, and exciton formation under light irradiation. The different ROS formation in the reaction medium was established via DMPO and TEMPO EPR analysis under light irradiation. Furthermore, the BTT-TPH-O-COF photocatalyst demonstrated rapid CEES oxidation ability to CEESO with a highly reusable nature, making this photocatalyst one of the best choices for practical and real-life implementation.96 Lastly, Zang and his co-workers developed an aminal-linked porphyrinic COF (Por-Aminal-COF) to decontaminate HDs rapidly. It is one of the best-reported photocatalysts, which converted CEES to CEESO in a very short reaction time of 5–10 min. The Por-Aminal-COF demonstrates a very high reaction rate compared with its imine-linked Por-COF counterpart (Fig. 13). The presence of the aminal linkage in the COF backbone enhanced the light-harvesting capacity of the COF framework along with the formation of ROS with higher concentrations, as confirmed by EPR analysis. Moreover, for the first-time TAS analysis, the distinct aminal linkage in the COF framework promotes inter-system crossing (ISC) with high efficiency in triplet state generation. This report sheds light on the importance of symmetry-controlled conjugation between the monomer units of the COF framework, which can produce robust and highly efficient photosensitizing COF materials (Table 3).39

2.3. Photochemical decontamination using porous organic polymers (POPs)
Many materials have been employed to detoxify sulfur mustard and its analogous derivatives; in this context, owing to its attenable functionality, superior chemical and thermal stability, and enhanced porosity, POPs emerge as a judicious choice.97 POPs are a class of advanced functional materials with structural tailorability, inherent porosity, and high flexibility, which have served for several applications like CO2 capture,98,99 CO2 reduction to solar fuels,100,101 biomass valorisation,102,103 organic transformation reactions,104,105 CO2 fixation,99 gas and liquid separation,106 water purification,107,108 energy storage,109 chemo- and biosensing110 and HD decontamination111–115 etc. (Fig. 14). Additionally, the extensive conjugated network with inherent porosity in the polymeric network allows facile exciton migration and prevents backward charge recombination, promoting its choice as a suitable candidate for photocatalysis. Based on the magnetic properties, this class of photoresponsive heterogeneous catalysts serves as a promising candidate in the domain of photocatalytic CWA detoxification. In this section, we elaborate a sequential recapitulation of the work on using POPs for HD detoxification applications followed by a tabular depiction of the diverse catalysts contributing towards the cause.
 Fig. 14  Generalized representation of porous organic polymers (POPs). 
Wang et al. reported a novel synthesis of conjugated porous polymers (CMPs) [B-(NPh2)3, B-CB3, B-CB2BT] bearing a high surface area with the aid of large internal-phase emulsion polymerization and microporous surface modulation and exploited it for the selective conversion of sulfides. An eight-fold increase in surface area was observed via implantation and subtraction of the breakable tert-butyl carboxylate (Boc) groups as a spacer in the micropores of the crosslinked polymer network, giving B-(Boc-NPh2)3 and B-(Boc-CB3). An ideal electrophilic motif, benzothiadiazole (BT), was grafted into the polymeric framework to give B-(Boc-CB)2-BT and B-CB2-BT, and experimental results proved its crucial part in the photocatalytic activity of the heterogeneous system. The activity of the CMPs as heterogeneous photocatalysts was achieved via sulfide oxidation to the corresponding sulfoxides using visible light illumination at room temperature. The photooxidation of TA to the intended mono-oxidized product methyl phenyl sulfoxide was virtually quantitatively selective (49.9%). Compared with polymers comprising NPh2 moieties, the ones with a CB moiety displayed greater conversions, while those with a stronger electron acceptor, a BT unit, displayed the best photochemical efficacy. This startling feature claimed that the π-electrons in the conjugated polymer framework are more important than the surface area in photochemical viability. This is consistent with a prior finding on a series of conjugated porous frameworks as photosensitizers, which demonstrated that polymers having strong electron acceptor units like BT could create singlet oxygen more effectively. The study concluded that the electronic structure, i.e., the donor and acceptor combination of the polymer backbone, with the best photocatalytic activity demonstrated by the polymer having the BT unit as a strong acceptor, is in resonance with the HOMO–LUMO band gap values of the BT comprising polymers resulting from the significantly low LUMO levels of the polymer. This work confers a highly stable, porous, reusable class of photosensitive heterogeneous catalysts and describes the influence of tailoring the structural and electronic properties on the photochemical activity.116
Several reports highlight the utilization of BODIPY-based POPs for the oxidative degradation of sulfur mustard via the generation of chemically active singlet oxygen species. Bandyopadhyay et al. presented a work on BODIPY-based POP-driven visible-light-assisted singlet-oxygen-mediated photocatalysis.117 In this work, a detailed analysis was carried out on the effect of tuning the surface area and its deliverable results on gas-adsorption properties via a judicious variation of substituents in the parent moiety. Three different monomers, n-octyl-substituted monomer (M1), 4-tertiary butylphenyl substituted BODIPY monomer (M2), and phenyl-replaced monomer (M3), were coupled with 1,3,5-triethynyl benzene (TEB) as a comonomer, resulting in the corresponding polymers (BDT1a, BDT1b), BDT2 and BDT3, respectively. A ten-times upsurge in surface area from 73 to 1010 m2 g−1 in BDT3 was detected, which can be attributed to the non-planarity induced by the phenyl ring and rigidity of the polymeric backbone. BDT3 exhibited the highest CO2 uptake and an appreciable H2 uptake among the designed catalysts. The catalysts were then explored for aerobic TA conversion to the corresponding non-toxic sulfoxides, where 96% conversion was achieved. p-Chloro-, bromo-, and methoxy-substituted TA also transformed to the subsequent sulfoxide with a higher yield under parallel reaction conditions. EPR spectroscopy analysis validated that the designed porous polymers were capable of photosensitization of 1O2 species, which is a contributing factor towards the catalyst's photocatalytic activity.
Liras et al. reported synthesising a BODIPY dye-based CMP (CMPBDP), which showed outstanding thermal stability, and an extensive surface area having microporosity (Fig. 15). They proficiently catalyzed the selective oxidation of TA to sulfoxide by forming 1O2 under visible light irradiation up to 500 nm.118 The heterogeneous material showed a four times faster rate than the subsequent soluble reference in the homogeneous reaction medium in addition to noteworthy reusability without losing its earlier integrity. The photocatalytic performance of the catalysts was evaluated using a 150 W quartz-halogen lamp under the influence of varying solvents, and it was observed that 2-ethoxyethanol delivered better results than conventional methanol. This demonstrates that while the polarity of the solvent appears to be a critical factor in the photocatalytic event in CMP materials, other factors like dispersibility and “operative surface area” need to be noted.

Su et al. presented carbazolic conjugated microporous polymers (C-CMPs) synthesized through carbazole-derived oxidative polymerization as a pronounced metal-free solar-mediated heterogeneous catalyst for selective sulfide oxidation using O2 and visible light. The as-designed C-CMP photocatalyst has a large surface area of 1137 m2 g−1 and is thermally stable in nitrogen to 600 °C. The extensive surface area and higher porosity can be assigned to the stiff and robust skeleton, the permanent and the interparticle porosity between the agglomerative particles of the carbazole moieties. The photocatalytic activity of C-CMP was evaluated in the presence of O2 on exposure to visible light, and it furnished the conversion of sulphides to sulfoxides with noticeable efficacy and selectivity (Fig. 16). The high photocatalytic activity was retained with no distinguishable ruination up to the seventh cycle, recommending its superior reusability. It is envisaged that modifying the substituents or using a new framework may result in tuning the catalytic efficacy of C-CMPs and their relevance to various catalysis processes at the molecular level. The work accentuates N-containing CMPs as budding photocatalysts for mediating organic transformations feasibly and sustainably.119

Jiang et al. utilized the concept of biomimetic catalysis. They developed an Sn-porphyrin-derived porous aromatic backbone (SnPor@PAF) which acted as a singlet-oxygen-mediated photosensitizer to ameliorate the selective light-assisted oxidation of sulfides into sulfoxides under mild reaction conditions.120 The developed catalyst showed good conversion of TA into methyl phenyl sulfoxide, with a very high turn-over frequency value of 19872 h−1. Moreover, the catalytic activity was retained without any diminution up to four catalytic cycles, demonstrating significant recyclability and reusability of the heterogeneous catalyst. The activation of molecular oxygen into singlet oxygen and superoxide radical anion was confirmed through several experiments, including oxygen isotope labelling, a conventional fluorescent probe technique, in situ ESR, etc. To highlight the significance of SnPor@PAF as an ideal photosensitizer and establish a correlation between its p-conjugated structure and photocatalytic performance, a comparative analysis was conducted using its non-conjugated counterpart, SnPor@HCP. It is shown that SnPor@HCP had a much lower photocatalytic yield of 68%. The findings show that the strong photocatalytic activity of SnPor@PAF is due to its π-conjugated framework, which can control a reduced binding energy, good visible light adsorption, and smooth intramolecular charge transfer. This work throws ample light on juxtaposing the outstanding photocatalytic trait of metalloporphyrin and the sturdy and stiff skeleton of PAFs via a facile synthetic procedure, thereby presenting a phenomenal heterogeneous photosensitizer.
Liang et al. utilized a simple oxidative coupling reaction to prepare two cationic polycarbazole frameworks (CPOP-28 and CPOP-29) with heterolytic iridium complexes bearing carbazolyl moieties.121 These heterogeneous catalysts showed outstanding activity towards the oxidation of sulfides when irradiated with a white LED, owing to enriched accessible catalytic sites and an expedited mass transfer process (Fig. 17). With the perceptive incorporation of trifluoromethyl groups (–CF3) into the polymeric framework, CPOP-29 enhanced the photophysical and oxidative properties of the catalyst, resulting in appealing catalytic activity compared with CPOP-28. This work reflected the scope of modulating the photocatalytic features by properly tuning the substituents in the new skeletal backbone.

Zhi and his team forwarded a simplistic route for synthesizing phenomenal CMP-based photocatalysts ensuring excellent uniformity and recyclability based on the coupling of tenable donor–acceptor moieties for the aerobic detoxification of sulfur derivatives. Based on this concept, a practically feasible method successfully built two carbazole-based CMPs (CzBSe-CMP and CzBQn-CMP). They were investigated under visible-light irradiation for the photocatalytic detoxification of mustard gas simulants in the presence of green O2 (Fig. 18).122 It was observed that CzBSe-CMP shows improved photocatalytic efficiency and can selectively photooxidize noxious CEES into non-toxic sulphoxide products. This may be attributed to a competent electron transfer and clear electron–hole separation in the case of CzBSe-CMP upon the assimilation of 2,1,3-benzoselenadiazole-based electron-deficient units, which expedites the 1O2 generation process, resulting in improved results.

Yu and his co-authors fabricated two benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-4,8-dione (BDD)-based CMPs, one containing the unit of BDD in which an electron-withdrawing unit has been integrated (CMP-BDD), and the other comprising the benzene ring with no electron-withdrawing effect (CMP-B) solely.123 The photocatalytic performance of both these catalysts towards the photooxidation of organic sulfide was further investigated. Experimental analysis suggested that the congregation of a BDD entity supported over an extended π-conjugated network boosted the light-harvesting efficiency and charge separation potential of the designed CMP-BDD; hence it showed excellent conversion (99%), remarkable repeatability, and high selectivity at ambient temperature in the presence of TA as the model substrate and molecular oxygen as a green oxidant. A similar comparative study was carried out with CMP-B, which showed comparatively menial conversion efficacy, clearly emphasizing the significance of the BDD moiety in constructing metal-free, porous, photoassisted catalysts that can carry out TA oxidation reactions proficiently under ambient conditions in the absence of strong oxidants.
Atilgan et al. described the synthesis of Br-BDP-POP and I-BDP-POP for the catalytic photooxidation of CEES to CEESO (Fig. 19).7 In this work, they adopted a post-synthesis modification strategy to obtain halogenated BODIPY-POP from the new hydrogenated polymers. This is an efficient technique to mitigate the drawbacks of uncontrolled polymerization and dehalogenation of the BODIPY centre as observed in the polymerization of a pre-halogenated monomeric counterpart. Both the catalysts display remarkable singlet oxygen generation efficiency, and a photoexcited state singlet to excited-state triplet intersystem crossing coupled with significantly reduced fluorescence quantum yields, achieving a fivefold enhanced conversion rate compared with the unimproved polymer. Ma et al. fabricated a series of extraordinarily stable and smoothly tenable isostructural two-dimensional hydrogen-linked organic frameworks (HOFs), HOF-10x (x = 0, 1, 2).124 An outstanding pore-size extension strategy created on “shape-matching” intermolecular π–π assembling interactions was employed over the HOF materials, self-assembled from pyrene-derived tectons with the systematic extension of π-conjugated molecular arms to shun unwanted impregnation or staggered stacking. From PXRD analysis, N2 adsorption, and TGA analysis, it was observed that HOF-102 shows excellent chemical and thermal stability among the series. The BET surface area for HOF-102 was found to be the highest, 2500 m2 g−1, and the material was also found to maintain its crystallinity when tested under harsh reaction conditions. The introduction of massive fused aromatic rings leading to expansion of the tectonic units is an impressive strategy to enhance the pore dimensions without compromising the skeletal stability and is also an underlying reason behind the improved catalyst stability. Drawing inspiration from this, the HOF-2 material was decorated over a typical fibre to fabricate a photochemically responsive HOF-102/fibre composite wearable and flexible material and it was investigated for selective aerobic oxidation of the HD simulant, CEES, to the innocuous product CEESO. The material showed 100% conversion in 30 min and was reusable up to three times in the catalytic cycle, demonstrating great potential as mustard gas protective gear.

Jiang et al. reported designing an efficient, reusable, metal-free heterogeneous catalytic system for sunlight-driven aerobic oxidation reactions. Herein, a carbazolyl-porphyrin-derived π-conjugated microporous polymer (TCPP-CMP) was synthesized, which displayed an elevated surface area, consistent pores, high stability, extensive light absorption capacity, and appropriate redox potentials.125 The as-synthesized catalyst showed excellent selectivity and conversion of TA under natural light and retained its catalytic performance for up to four cycles due to the robustness and rigidity of the polymeric network. The conversion reaction was assessed over a broad range of substrates, and notable conversion was observed for TA derivatives pertaining to electron-donating and electron-withdrawing motifs. Relativistic investigation into the mechanisms shows the generation of ROS (1O2 and O2˙−), which promotes the effectiveness of the photocatalyst.
Lan et al. reported a donor–acceptor thiophene triazine conjugated polymer (TTCOP) ingrafted with boron nitride (BN) via a strategic, one-pot in situ polymerization route. The designed catalysed was utilized for oxidative sulfur decontamination. Compared with pristine TTCOP, the hetero-conjugated BN@TTCOP demonstrated remarkable photocatalytic performance under visible light irradiation. EPR spectroscopy analysis, trapping experiments, and M–S plots extensively represent a convincible mechanistic pathway showing the generation of ROS (O2˙−), which triggers the oxidation process. The photocatalytic tests were investigated under varying reaction conditions over a broad range of substrates, and the highest activity reached >99% conversion, approximately 2 fold higher than that of pristine TTCOP. The pronounced photocatalytic ability of the heterogeneous catalysts prompted further expansion of its scope with a series of TA derivatives pertaining to both electron-donating and -withdrawing units. The results vividly depicted that cumulative electronic and steric effects influence substrate activity. The ineffaceable role of BN was also investigated in enhancing the catalyst's optoelectronic features and its effect on photocatalytic activity. It was revealed that implantation of electronegative BN into the skeletal framework boosted the interfacial charge transfer of the TTCOP's excitons, improving the separation efficiency and narrow band gap structure of the new unit, thereby leading to an increment of catalytic activity for the visible-light assisted oxidation of sulfides. This study focuses on the effect of BN in increasing the charge separation and photocatalytic activity of polymer photocatalysts, and it gives useful insights for the design of heterogeneous catalysts in organic processes (Fig. 20).126

Kim et al. designed three tetraphenyl ethylene-based isomeric sp2-conjugated POPs (TPo, TPm, and TPp) using ortho-, meta-, and para-xylylene dicyanide, respectively, for selective photocatalysed aerobic CEES decontamination under mild reaction conditions. The isomeric polymers were readily capable of generating different ROS.127 Under visible light irradiation, TPm efficiently generated 1O2, whereas TPp produced both O2˙− and HO˙. According to a known conversion mechanism, the TPm and TPp effectively produced ROS to convert CEES into the nontoxic compound CEESO under atmospheric conditions. During ultrasonic irradiation too, TPm and TPp produced 1O2. The intriguing photocatalytic activity of POPs motivated researchers to assess their photocatalytic detoxifying capacity in visible light. Further investigations revealed that TPm and TPp show pronounced selective CEES (sulfide) oxidation to the benign sulfoxide, CEESO, in protic solvents under 405 nm light irradiation, with t1/2 = 4.5 and 12 min, respectively, prohibiting overoxidized byproduct CEESO2 (sulfone, toxic). This report presents a cost-effective microwave-assisted method for synthesizing novel POPs and highlights that tuning of the molecular core plays a role in varying ROS generation, thereby delivering prominent results in CWA degradation (Fig. 21).

Li et al. resorted to thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole (TzTz) as a linker unit for constructing three CMP photocatalysts via a catalyst-free solvothermal route and promoted them to undertake the revolutionary task of the selective development of sulfoxides from sulfides. Phenyl units with C2, C3, and D2h symmetry were investigated as building blocks for CMP photocatalysts, yielding TzTz-XMP-1, TzTz-CMP-2, and TzTz-CMP-3, respectively, and the effect of modifying the symmetry of building blocks on catalyst activity was investigated. Photocatalytic experimental results depicted that the highly symmetric TzTz-CMP-3 demonstrated favourable visible-light-powered selective oxidation of sulfides under atmospheric O2 compared with its counterparts. This anticipated outcome is attributed to the well-symmetric π-conjugated aromatic ring of TzTz-CMP-3 endowing it with more favourable photocatalytic behaviour such as better light-harvesting ability, boosted charge carrier separation, swift transfer, etc., and the BET specific surface area is greater than those of its less symmetric cousins. ROS-quenching investigations, EPR tests, and Mott–Schottky measurements all pointed to a feasible mechanism by which blue light-powered electrons most effectively convert O2 to O2˙−. Benefitting from the catalyst's remarkable catalytic activity, it was explored over a range of sulfides, and for all cases, the product selectivity was close to 100%, but the architecture of the substrates crucially affected the conversion. A noteworthy remark on this photocatalyst is that, unlike the conventional organic/hybrid photocatalysts, TzTz-CMP-3 shows a substantial conversion of TA (71%) and outstanding selectivity for MPS (99%) with a reaction time of 15 min without any additional participation of the electron-transfer promoter, TEMPO. In contrast, a subdued conversion was seen upon the addition of TEMPO to the photocatalytic system. The highly amorphous nature of the hetero-catalyst may be a reason for its intriguing character. Thus, TzTz-CMP-3 transpires as a cleaner, greener and sustainable photocatalyst for the practical selective formation of sulfoxides, forecasting appreciable catalytic performance without the engagement of any electron transfer mediator. This work vividly underlines the prudent influence of symmetry of the building units on the molecular construction of CMPs as high-performance photocatalysts, contributing profoundly towards the selective photocatalytic formation of unique organic products (Table 4).128

Kim et al. demonstrated the engineering of a composite-based metal-free porous-organic-polymer containing a protonated imidazole core (KUP-3), which showed promising potential for generating reactive oxygen species, thereby contributing towards the detoxification of HD simulants.44 The photocatalytic performance of KUP-3 was analysed using CEES, an analogue of sulfur mustard under ambient experimental conditions, which showed 99% conversion of CEES into non-toxic CEESO, confirmed by 1H-NMR data. No toxic intermediate species were obtained, as validated by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS). To foster a real-time application of the efficient photosensitizer KUP-3, the group fabricated photoresponsive composite fabric materials, which military personnel can use as detoxifying cloth against CWAs. KUP-3 was craftily intertwined within a cotton-polyester blend fabric, giving KUP-3@OFb, which showed significant advantages over the new material after analysis, presenting a conversion of 93% in 3 h with no side products. Furthermore, considering the impressive absorbency and recyclability of the sponge and the effective photocatalytic activity of KUP-3, KUP-3@MSp, synthesized via ingrafting KUP-3 in the sponge, presented a practically feasible decontamination tool. This catalyst showed superior catalytic performance wherein nearly 100% conversion of CEES occurred within 30 min.
Liu et al. worked on ingrafting carbazole and boron-containing dyes in one framework and rationally presented two unprecedented donor–acceptor-based CMPs (Cz-BF2-CMP and Cz-BPh2-CMP),129 which exhibited promising potential in the aerobic oxidation of TA due to boosted interfacial charge transfer, improved photogenerated electron–hole separation, and efficient photocatalytic performance. Contrary to the traditional photocatalytic sulfide oxidation to organic sulfoxides, these metal-free heterogeneous systems could proceed with the selective aerobic organic transformation reactions in the presence of green solvents like EtOH and white light as the power source. It was observed that Cz-BF2-CMP carried out the reaction effectively with >99% conversion and above 86% selectivity, unlike Cz-BPh2-CMP, which showed a significantly lower conversion yield (79%). The alteration of the fluorine-substituted group with a less electronegative phenyl resulted in a diminished donor–acceptor effect, which might be an apparent reason for the poorer yield.
2.4. Photochemical decontamination using covalent-triazine frameworks (CTFs)
Thomas and his team in 2008 first published the synthesis of CTFs consisting of triazine moieties and aromatic rings using incredibly dynamic condensation processes (Fig. 22).130 CTFs are considered promising porous, layered, conjugated material with aromatic CN linkages (triazine unit), endowing them with unique characteristic features like high chemical stability and rich nitrogen content.131 CTFs found numerous applications in separation, photocatalysis like CO2 reduction,132 pollutant degradation133 and heterogeneous catalysis.134,135 Wang and co-workers reported crystalline 2D-CTFs synthesized via controlling dual modulators for the effective photochemical oxidation of sulfides to less toxic sulfoxides.136 Aniline with co-solvents is utilized as a double modulator for creating dynamic covalent bonds and processing non-covalent self-assembled bonds for constructing 2D-CTFs under dual modulator control. The photocatalytic performance of CTFs was enhanced by peripheral functionalization with the methoxy group towards the photocatalytic oxidation of various sulfides with numerous functional groups.

Wu et al.137 reported CTF for the photochemical detoxification of sulfides to less toxic sulfoxides under blue LED light illumination. Conjugated POPs having donors–acceptors as building block units can show enhanced photocatalytic activity with effective charge distribution and transfer. In this regard, the authors designed three CTFs by employing different electron-rich units in the porous frameworks to have a fine-tuning band structure of the materials. Among the three polymers, CTF containing the phenothiazine moiety demonstrated enhanced photocatalytic performance towards the oxidation of sulfides under aerobic conditions and visible light illumination. Sulfides with electron-deficient groups exhibited excellent conversion and selectivity towards less toxic sulfoxides, whereas sulfides with electron-withdrawing groups displayed slightly lower conversion and selectivity.
Chaubey et al. reported donor–acceptor conjugation-based CTF (AQ-CTFs) synthesized by melamine and 2,6-diaminoanthraquinone (AQ) as monomer units and utilized as an effective photocatalyst for oxidation of dibenzyl sulfide to form dibenzyl sulfoxide with 99% yield and selectivity under aerobic conditions. They proposed that the superior light-capturing capability and the effective electron transfer in the interfacial area are the reasons for the increased photocatalytic activity of M-AQ-CTFs (Table 5).138

2.5. Photochemical decontamination using TiO2-based materials
TiO2 is a naturally occurring titanium oxide belonging to the family of transition metal oxides known as titania or titanium(IV) oxide with the formula TiO2.139 TiO2 is usually found in rubber, plastics, ceramics, synthetic fibers, paints, printing inks, food, and cosmetics, etc. The three crystalline forms of TiO2 that occur naturally are anatase, rutile, and brookite.140 Due to its widespread availability, biocompatibility, affordability, non-toxicity, and excellent chemical stability, TiO2 is one of the most widely used commercially available nano-size materials.140,141 Due to their ideal characteristics properties, TiO2 nanoparticles are used in numerous industries, including paint application, toothpaste, UV protection, water purification, decontamination, organic synthesis and photocatalysis.142–144
Prasad and co-workers detoxified HD using natural sunlight and UV light using titania nanoparticles of different sizes. TiO2 nanoparticles with a size of 11 nm exhibited complete HD gas decontamination by 6 h of natural sunlight irradiation. They demonstrated from the GC-MS analysis that the decontamination of HD without illumination produces only hydrolyzed products such as thiodiglycol, whereas under light irradiation, compounds like CO2, acetaldehyde, thiodiglycol, sulfoxide, acetic acid, etc. were produced owing to the photocatalysis caused by the TiO2 nanoparticles. The photocatalytic reaction mechanism follows the oxidation of the carbon atoms, dissociation of the carbon–sulfur bonds, oxidation of the sulfur atoms, hydrolysis of the carbon–chlorine bonds, or removal of HCl enabled by hydroxyl radicals on the external surface of the TiO2.145 Lang et al. reported a polydopamine-assembled TiO2 semiconductor (TiO2@PDA) for the visible-light-assisted photocatalytic oxidation of sulfides using aerobic oxygen. TiO2@PDA can implement the aerobic oxidation of thioanisole, which can efficiently move the electrons to the conduction band of the anatase form of TiO2 to stimulate aerobic oxygen by the extensively conjugated electron system of polydopamine and the cooperation of TEMPO.146 Herein, π-conjugated polymeric PDA generates photoexcited electrons, which can be efficiently transferred to the conduction band (CB) of anatase TiO2. These photoexcited electrons on the CB of TiO2 are then transferred to molecular oxygen (O2) to produce singlet oxygen (1O2). Here the formation of a heterojunction between the π-conjugated polymeric PDA and TiO2 is very significant in facilitating the transfer of electrons from the PDA to the TiO2, which boosts the 1O2 formation and, eventually, sulfide oxidation (Fig. 23).

Zecchina et al.147 studied Mn, Fe, and V-doped titania–silica catalysts for the photochemical decontamination of HD and CEES under light irradiation. The experiments concluded that the parental titania–silica photocatalyst demonstrated photodecomposition ability under UV light only, whereas the modified materials showed efficient photocatalytic activity towards the detoxification of HD under the illumination of both UV and visible light. Mn/TiO2/SiO2 and V/TiO2/SiO2 materials exhibited a significant more than 85% yield of the photodegradation product. The comparatively higher rate of photodegradation ability of Mn-doped titania–silica catalyst towards HD is ascribed to the presence of Mn on the surface of the titania–silica, thereby enhancing the exciton (electron–hole pair) generation ability under irradiation of light. Giles et al. reported148 the photocatalytic aerobic oxidation of CEES, an HD simulant under visible light illumination utilizing SiO2–TiO2 composite synthesized via TiO2 nanoparticles or nanosheets anchored into SiO2 monodispersed spheres. Compared with SiO2–TiO2 nanosheets and TiO2 nanoparticles, the 5 nm SiO2–TiO2 composite exhibited superior catalytic activity (6.9-fold w.r.t. TiO2 NPs) towards the photocatalytic oxidation of HD with the rate of reaction 56.2 μmol g−1 h−1 and 1.64 × 10−5 molecules per photon quantum yield (QY). The TiO2 NPs and nanosheets are associated with surface defects or confined states, and the SiO2 support facilitates the homogeneous spreading of TiO2 NPs and acts as a CEES-absorbing medium, thereby promoting the enhancement in catalytic efficiency of the SiO2–TiO2 composite towards visible light-induced oxidative transformation. Keller and co-workers149 developed WO3-functionalized TiO2 nanotubes for the light-driven photochemical decontamination of diethyl sulfide. Impregnation of 4 wt% WO3 in TiO2 nanotubes facilitates the photocatalytic efficiency towards DES removal.
Panayotov et al.151 reported the photochemical oxidation of CEES, an HD simulant, utilizing TiO2–SiO2 powders. They also performed the photochemical oxidation of diethyl sulfide (DES) to investigate the photochemical activity of TiO2–SiO2 powder towards Cl replacement in toxic CEES molecules. The results demonstrated that a Cl substituent in CEES does not effectively impact the photooxidation process. The CEES molecule forms a hydrogen bond with the Si–OH groups via both the S and Cl moieties on the surface of the TiO2–SiO2 photocatalyst. Again, the adsorbed O2 is photoactivated on the TiO2 stage of the catalyst, which in turn migrates on the catalyst from the TiO2 stage to the toxic CEES located on the Si–OH moieties, and finally a photooxidation process depletes the hydrogen-bonded CEES molecules from the Si–OH groups.
Selishchev et al.152 reported TiO2-based composite materials, which were synthesized via the thermal hydrolysis of TiOSO4 in the company of activated carbon or SiO2 for the photochemical oxidation of the vapour of diethyl sulfide. The findings showed that the TOF value for the TiO2/SiO2 composite with 40 wt% of TiO2 content photocatalysts was discovered to be 3.5 times larger than that of TiO2. Using TiO2 NPs and polyoxometalates encapsulated in titania NPs in liquid phase at r.t., Naseri and colleagues investigated the photocatalytic decontamination of hazardous CWAs and HD to harmless sulfone compounds under the illumination of ultraviolet light. The findings revealed that a significant increase in the reaction rate of photochemical decontamination is caused by the substantial adsorption of chemicals on the surface of the nanoTiO2. They accomplished quicker HD detoxification to several intermediate and generally harmless compounds within 90 min with minimal loading of catalyst by simultaneously conducting photolysis and photocatalysis in hexane.153 Štengl et al.154 reported an In3+-doped TiO2 and TiO2/In2S3 nanocomposite synthesized via the homogeneous hydrolysis of urea and thioacetamide for the photocatalytic decomposition of HD under irradiation of visible light. 98.5% conversion of HD was achieved with a TiO2/In2S3 nanocomposite having 0.54 wt% of In. They hypothesized that increasing the In2S3 content in the TiO2/In2S3 composite would boost the detoxifying activity for the stoichiometric decomposition of HD.
Sheng et al. described polyimide–titanium dioxide as a photoactive catalyst for the selective oxidation of sulfides under aerobic conditions and the influence of blue LED light using triethylamine (TEA) as a redox mediator where TEA mediates the transmission of electrons between polyimide–P25 and sulfides. Polyimide–P25 exhibited enhanced photochemical activity towards the visible light-assisted aerobic oxidation of sulfides compared with pristine polyimide and P25. The 3-fold improved photooxidation using TEA corroborates the beneficial interaction between the polyimide–P25 and TEA. The in situ EPR confirms the formation of O2˙− as the primary ROS to facilitate sulfide oxidation to less toxic sulfoxide (Fig. 24).150 Herein, the polyimide–P25 exhibited an enhanced light adsorption capacity to generate photoexcited electrons, which will be transferred to molecular oxygen (O2) via TiO2. The formed heterojunction between the TiO2 and polyimide–P25 interface assisted in transferring the electron from the polyimide to the TiO2 and facilitated the aerobic oxidation of O2. It has been found that pristine TiO2 or polyimide–P25 is inactive for performing aerobic oxidation, but the composite is highly active under solar irradiation. This sheds light on the importance of forming heterojunctions, which can boost electron transfer and enhance the oxidation reaction rate.

Ramacharyulu et al.145 reported the photocatalytic decontamination of HD utilizing titania nanomaterials of different sizes under sunlight and UV-A light illumination. TiO2 nanomaterials having a size of ∼11 nm of the anatase phase achieved 100% conversion of sulfur mustard within 6 h of reaction time. They revealed that with a decreasing particle size ranging from 1000 nm to 11 nm, HD detoxification efficacy increases from 26% to 100% under sunlight irradiation. Different products, including acetaldehyde, CO2 contributing to the oxidation of HD, breaking of the C–S bond, and removal of HCl mediated by hydroxyl radicals generated on the surface of TiO2 as a result of photocatalysis, were produced from the photooxidation of HD. Sreedhar and co-authors revealed a sunlight-aided photocatalytic degradation of HD utilizing a sulfur-doped titania nano-catalyst. The sulfur-doped titania nano-catalyst resulted in a better catalytic performance with 100% decontamination within 120 min compared with undoped TiO2 nano-catalyst and commercial TiO2 nano-catalyst, attributed to the enhanced absorption of light and the decreased band gap energy in the presence of sunlight. They proposed that the oxidation of the S atom, hydrolysis, and elimination processes generate harmless products as a result of the photocatalytic degradation of HD.156
Sengele et al.155 reported Ta-doped TiO2 as a photocatalyst for decontaminating diethyl sulfide (DES), a simulant of CWA named yperite (mustard gas) under the illumination of UV-A or solar light. They indicated that incorporating Ta into the doped TiO2 materials and raising the temperature during calcination improved the catalytic performance for decontaminating DES with 80% conversion or 5 g m−3 of air under UV-A light in just 200 minutes (Fig. 25). With 2 mol% of TEMPO as a redox mediator and blue LED light illumination, Lang et al. demonstrated dye-functionalized TiO2 materials for effective aerobic sulfide oxidation to sulfoxide. They employed anatase-based TiO2 functionalized with 0.33 mol% alizarin red S to illustrate the fabrication of dye-sensitized TiO2 materials (Fig. 26). They achieved 96% conversion of sulfide with 92% selectivity towards sulfoxide within a period of 1.3 h (Table 6).157

2.6. Photochemical decontamination using other porous materials
Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) is a metal-free polymer and an n-type semiconductor material that has garnered the colossal interest of researchers towards photocatalysis due to the enthralling intrinsic features, like its unique 2D layered structural characteristics, electrical and optical properties, and superior physicochemical stability, and the non-toxic nature of the material. This polymeric g-C3N4 material has a graphitic stacking of tri-s-triazine moieties joined by planar amino groups, which form the building units of the C3N4 layers. However, g-C3N4 suffers from specific bottlenecks due to a poor surface area, an enhanced charge recombination and a meagre visible light utilization; hence constructing heterostructures of g-C3N4 with other semiconductor materials is of budding interest.
Bandosz et al. reported the photochemical decontamination of HD vapors and droplets using daylight photocatalytic porous zinc peroxide/graphitic carbon nitride nanocomposite (ZnO2/g-C3N4 composite) under light and dark environments (Fig. 27).41 The photocatalyst showed comparable efficacy for the photocatalytic decontamination of sulfur-based chemical warfare agents in both visible light and dark environments with conversion rates of greater than 90%. They proposed that the ZnO2 served as an energy storage component and the g-C3N4 served as a photoactive phase during photocatalysis.

In the area of photocatalysis, plasmonic nanostructures have aroused immense interest from researchers due to their ability to enhance reactivity and tune reaction selectivity due to the advantages of their powerful interactions with light and their numerous energy decay processes. Halas et al.158 reported plasmonic aluminium nanoparticles (Al NPs) for the selective photocatalytic detoxification of an HD simulant. Under visible light illumination, Al NPs showed 72% conversion of the HD simulant CEES via gas-phase photodecomposition to chloroethane and ethyl vinyl sulfide (EVS). They demonstrated that under light illumination, the cleavage of the C–S bond is facilitated, whereas thermo-catalytic (dark) conditions favor C–Cl bond cleavage and HCl elimination, indicating the potential of Al NPs towards the detoxification of chemical warfare agents to less hazardous products (Fig. 28).

Zhang and co-workers reported a Pt/BiVO4 photoactive catalyst for sulfide oxidation under visible light illumination utilizing H2O as the oxygen source and O2 as the electron acceptor.159 The catalyst exhibited superior catalytic performances towards sulfide oxidation using water compared with other solvents where water acts as an oxygen source to form sulfoxide. They confirmed from the isotopic labeling experiment that oxygen atoms appeared in the sulfoxide primarily from the water. The reactive peroxy-oxygen species were created from water oxidation on the catalyst via the two-electron pathway, evidenced by the EPR spectroscopic analysis. They also carried out the detoxification reaction of methylphenyl sulfide, having various electron-donating and withdrawing groups on the phenyl ring. They achieved higher conversion efficiency for TA than the substituted TA towards forming less toxic sulfoxides owing to the non-availability of hydrophobic substrates to reach the BiVO4 surface.
Pyrene belongs to a class of archetypal polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH). The presence of organic chromophore in pyrene permits their application in photochemical processes. Stoddart et al.42 studied a pyrene-based photocatalyst for the selective oxidation of the HD simulant CEES under aerobic and visible light conditions and found an efficient catalytic activity towards forming a less toxic sulfone derivative (CEESO2). The π-extended nature of the pyrene-based mechanically interlocked molecule implements [π⋯π] stacking, which facilitates the efficient fabrication of tetrachromophoric octacationic homo[2]catenanes, thereby enhancing the charge transfer capacity of the photocatalyst.
Mak and co-workers160 reported a porphyrinic silver cluster assembled material, Ag12TPyP, composed of a porphyrin-stabilized Ag12 chalcogenolate cluster core for the efficient photochemical detoxification of the mustard gas simulant CEES. They confirmed that the synergistic effects between the silver cluster and porphyrin ligand and the intense attraction between the CEES and the cluster promoted the formation of 1O2, thereby enhancing the rate of decontamination of the mustard gas simulant and producing 74.2 mg g−1 CEES uptake, respectively. They demonstrated that, with the Ag12TPyP photocatalyst, the oxidative decontamination of CEES resulted in 98% conversion within 4 min of reaction time under the illumination of white LED light to a non-toxic CEESO product (Fig. 29). Table 7 describes the advantages and disadvantages of various photo-porous catalysts.

Table 7 Advantages and disadvantages of various photo-porous catalysts




Porous photocatalysts
Advantages
Disadvantages




MOFs
In this critical review, we furnish the current state of MOFs as a photocatalyst for sulphide oxidation and sulphur mustard decontamination. Some of the outstanding photocatalytic properties of MOFs are attributed to (1) the highly porous architecture of MOFs, which effectively concentrates contaminants into cavities where they come into more excellent proximity with photoactive radicals and other environmental substances, (2) proficient structural tunability that permits efficient charge separation and incredible visible light absorption, and (3) the ongoing production of ROS attacking the organic molecules to cause rapid oxidation. Additionally, MOFs are advantageous alternatives for developing potent heterojunction photocatalysts, providing them with specific benefits over other previously studied photocatalysts.161
Despite the several advantages of MOFs as promising photocatalysts, several significant challenges exist. The stability of MOFs in practical applications is still debatable; the trade-off between stability and photoactivity has not yet been identified. Furthermore, paying more attention to the effects of reactive species produced by photocatalysis on the stability of MOF structures is essential. After multiple photocatalytic cycles, the structural integrity of MOF shows the leaching of metal ion and potential degradation by products of organic linkers after the radical assaults. The potential for MOFs in large-scale industrial applications could be considerably increased using stable and photoactive MOFs with unique organic linkers.161


COFs
Covalent organic frameworks are an emerging porous, light, and crystalline material class. These innovative photocatalysts, called COFs, have recently been used to catalyse organic transformations under benign and permanent reaction conditions. The benefit of confinement effects, inherent to the porous and long-range ordered structure of COF materials, is particularly underappreciated. Although preliminary findings suggest that the substrate dimension is one factor affecting the photocatalysis kinetics and selectivity in connection to the COF pore diameter, a few investigations explicitly address the photoreactivity and product selectivity as a function of the COF pore size.162
However, scaling up the COF synthesis is a challenging commitment. Although recent research on COF synthesis has yielded encouraging findings, creating pure, crystalline, covalently extended COFs and scaling their synthesis for commercialization remain challenging. Most COFs are currently produced as laboratory-scale milligram powders with limited processability. They are not suitable for large-scale manufacturing due to difficult conditions, lengthy reaction times, and the high reaction temperature of the widely used solvothermal synthesis and the poor crystalline products of the ionothermal synthesis.163


POPs
In contrast to their homogeneous counterparts, porous organic polymers (POPs) are a novel class of heterogeneous photocatalysts having the benefit of being simple to separate for recycling. POPs have several general characteristics, including high porosity and surface area, high catalyst loading, and excellent structural stability. These characteristics are crucial for their employment as extremely effective heterogeneous catalysts. POPs can be employed as both adsorbents and photocatalysts for various oxidation and reduction reactions because of their high photocatalytic activity and excellent porosity. In summary, POPs are a viable platform for effective photocatalysis because of their strong photocatalytic efficacy and good reusability. POPs are expected to have a bright future as more effective photocatalytic POPs develop for use in real-world applications.
However, POPs are frequently described as amorphous, unlike MOFs or crystalline COFs. As a result, they have lower surface areas and a somewhat broad pore size distribution, which will exhibit significant disadvantages for using POPs in heterogeneous catalysis. The irregular or short-range ordered structure and significant quantities of terminal groups and imperfections in POPs would also disturb the catalyst loadings and efficiency. However, most POPs are limited to use as photocatalysts for a restricted number of redox processes. POPs with extremely high redox potentials are thus desired to explore the range of their applications, but this may come at a cost in terms of visible-light utilisation efficiency.164,165


CTFs
The advantages of CTF materials include predictable structures, good thermochemical stability, and adjustable porosity. CTFs have unique features due to the strong covalent bonding of the triazine linkages, including a high nitrogen content and good chemical stability. Due to the aforementioned unique qualities, CTFs are desirable candidates for various applications, including photocatalysis. According to dynamic covalent chemistry principles, strong triazine linkage formation also solves the significant crystallisation issue during ordered CTF synthesis, demonstrating that stronger bonds reduce the self-correcting capacity. Recent developments in noncovalent π–π stacking interactions between layers of planar monomers have produced very periodic structured porous structures. Crystalline CTFs outperformed amorphous ones in a variety of catalytic applications.97
Even though CTFs are promising photocatalysts with many benefits, several significant obstacles must be addressed before CTFs can be widely employed as reliable and practical materials. CTFs exhibited poor processibility due to the impenetrable and infusible characteristics of the solid covalent frameworks. The structural characterisation of CTFs and their catalytically active species have not been adequately demonstrated. Mild synthesis techniques are only occasionally used in the literature, and ionothermal synthesis creates most CTFs. The material may carbonise and turn black under these strong reaction conditions, making the characterisation process more difficult. Additionally, since synthesis operations take place in vacuum-sealed glass/quartz ampoules, there is a certain likelihood that an ampoule explosion will occur due to gases produced during the reaction. Before commercialization, toxicology research on CTF compounds is essential, yet none has been undertaken.131


TiO2-derived catalysts
Due to its outstanding optical and electronic properties, photoactivity, high chemical stability, low cost, non-toxicity, reusability, and eco-friendliness, titanium dioxide (TiO2) has received much attention as a photocatalyst for a long time and has been regarded as one of the most promising materials for commercial use. To enhance TiO2's performance in comparison with commercial TiO2 powders, much more focus has been placed on the various TiO2 preparation techniques.166
TiO2 has been a hot subject of several remarkable research, although there are still several obstacles in the way of its widespread use. TiO2's insufficient capacity to absorb solar energy is its fundamental flaw. The use of visible light as the light source is constrained by its broad bandgap (3.2 eV). Another drawback of TiO2 in photocatalysis is the rapid recombination of photogenerated charge carriers, which lowers the quantum efficiency of the entire reaction. The surface area of TiO2 particles can be increased by shrinking them to the nanoscale; however, this may cause aggregation, which interferes with the light incidence on the active core and lowers the catalytic activity. Additionally, a significant barrier to its practical application may be the separation, recovery, and reuse of the nanostructured TiO2.167




3. Challenges and perspectives
Using diverse porous photocatalysts for the photocatalytic decontamination of HD simulant to harmless sulfoxide derivatives is a green technique because the reactions occur under moderate conditions without needing harmful organic solvents or high temperatures. Consequently, there is an increasing desire to develop photocatalysts to activate global HD simulant detoxification. Notwithstanding continual improvements in photocatalytic detoxification, most catalytic systems used today still function on a small scale and are inadequate for extensive industrial application. Some reports revealed using extensive UV light to activate photocatalysts to carry forward the photooxidation process. The formulation of a global detoxifying solution that can be extended to HD decontamination is anticipated soon. The universal formulation should surmount the current technological barrier, and the system should be eco-friendly. Future decontamination techniques must produce as minimal waste as possible while maintaining environmental safety and having minimum corrosive tendencies with stable active constituents.
Moreover, researchers should concentrate on fabricating photocatalysts with increased capacities for absorbing visible light, high catalytic efficiencies, long-term stabilities, and abilities for the selective detoxification of HD simulants to sulfoxides rather than forming toxic sulfone products to combat the difficulties. Furthermore, specialists should emphasize enlarging and developing more potent processors that can perform the photocatalytic detoxification of CWAs at a large-scale industrial level. There is still a long journey before producing reusable, large-scale, affordable, user-friendly, self-detoxifying catalysts, but there is a clear path ahead.
4. Conclusion
In this review, we have highlighted many porous photocatalytic systems that provided active, highly energetic, light-driven, radical/ionic intermediate routes for selective HD decontamination to sulfoxides rather than sulfone in our study. We have primarily focused on MOF, COF, POP, CTF, and TiO2-derived porous materials that have been reported to generate in-situ reactive oxygen species (ROS) by modulating the electronic properties and activation of molecular oxygen that are useful for HD detoxification. The majority of the reported photocatalysts demonstrated outstanding activity in the lab. However, only a few showed large-scale real-life applications to tackle the issues posed by the stockpiling and widespread use of HDs as chemical weapons, which pose a significant risk to national security and public safety. Our review of the present state of the research also reveals that photocatalysis is a promising strategy for utilizing highly renewable and efficient solar energy to address this challenge. Several concerns must be addressed, along with the concept of solar-driven HD decontamination, particularly on an industrial scale, which demands serious scientific attention. We believe this review will motivate extensive research toward designing and developing more efficient porous photocatalysts for both small- and large-scale HD detoxification to mitigate and address the fatal consequences caused by using HDs as a weapon of mass destruction.

MOFs	In this critical review, we furnish the current state of MOFs as a photocatalyst for sulphide oxidation and sulphur mustard decontamination. Some of the outstanding photocatalytic properties of MOFs are attributed to (1) the highly porous architecture of MOFs, which effectively concentrates contaminants into cavities where they come into more excellent proximity with photoactive radicals and other environmental substances, (2) proficient structural tunability that permits efficient charge separation and incredible visible light absorption, and (3) the ongoing production of ROS attacking the organic molecules to cause rapid oxidation. Additionally, MOFs are advantageous alternatives for developing potent heterojunction photocatalysts, providing them with specific benefits over other previously studied photocatalysts.161	Despite the several advantages of MOFs as promising photocatalysts, several significant challenges exist. The stability of MOFs in practical applications is still debatable; the trade-off between stability and photoactivity has not yet been identified. Furthermore, paying more attention to the effects of reactive species produced by photocatalysis on the stability of MOF structures is essential. After multiple photocatalytic cycles, the structural integrity of MOF shows the leaching of metal ion and potential degradation by products of organic linkers after the radical assaults. The potential for MOFs in large-scale industrial applications could be considerably increased using stable and photoactive MOFs with unique organic linkers.161
COFs	Covalent organic frameworks are an emerging porous, light, and crystalline material class. These innovative photocatalysts, called COFs, have recently been used to catalyse organic transformations under benign and permanent reaction conditions. The benefit of confinement effects, inherent to the porous and long-range ordered structure of COF materials, is particularly underappreciated. Although preliminary findings suggest that the substrate dimension is one factor affecting the photocatalysis kinetics and selectivity in connection to the COF pore diameter, a few investigations explicitly address the photoreactivity and product selectivity as a function of the COF pore size.162	However, scaling up the COF synthesis is a challenging commitment. Although recent research on COF synthesis has yielded encouraging findings, creating pure, crystalline, covalently extended COFs and scaling their synthesis for commercialization remain challenging. Most COFs are currently produced as laboratory-scale milligram powders with limited processability. They are not suitable for large-scale manufacturing due to difficult conditions, lengthy reaction times, and the high reaction temperature of the widely used solvothermal synthesis and the poor crystalline products of the ionothermal synthesis.163
POPs	In contrast to their homogeneous counterparts, porous organic polymers (POPs) are a novel class of heterogeneous photocatalysts having the benefit of being simple to separate for recycling. POPs have several general characteristics, including high porosity and surface area, high catalyst loading, and excellent structural stability. These characteristics are crucial for their employment as extremely effective heterogeneous catalysts. POPs can be employed as both adsorbents and photocatalysts for various oxidation and reduction reactions because of their high photocatalytic activity and excellent porosity. In summary, POPs are a viable platform for effective photocatalysis because of their strong photocatalytic efficacy and good reusability. POPs are expected to have a bright future as more effective photocatalytic POPs develop for use in real-world applications.	However, POPs are frequently described as amorphous, unlike MOFs or crystalline COFs. As a result, they have lower surface areas and a somewhat broad pore size distribution, which will exhibit significant disadvantages for using POPs in heterogeneous catalysis. The irregular or short-range ordered structure and significant quantities of terminal groups and imperfections in POPs would also disturb the catalyst loadings and efficiency. However, most POPs are limited to use as photocatalysts for a restricted number of redox processes. POPs with extremely high redox potentials are thus desired to explore the range of their applications, but this may come at a cost in terms of visible-light utilisation efficiency.164,165
CTFs	The advantages of CTF materials include predictable structures, good thermochemical stability, and adjustable porosity. CTFs have unique features due to the strong covalent bonding of the triazine linkages, including a high nitrogen content and good chemical stability. Due to the aforementioned unique qualities, CTFs are desirable candidates for various applications, including photocatalysis. According to dynamic covalent chemistry principles, strong triazine linkage formation also solves the significant crystallisation issue during ordered CTF synthesis, demonstrating that stronger bonds reduce the self-correcting capacity. Recent developments in noncovalent π–π stacking interactions between layers of planar monomers have produced very periodic structured porous structures. Crystalline CTFs outperformed amorphous ones in a variety of catalytic applications.97	Even though CTFs are promising photocatalysts with many benefits, several significant obstacles must be addressed before CTFs can be widely employed as reliable and practical materials. CTFs exhibited poor processibility due to the impenetrable and infusible characteristics of the solid covalent frameworks. The structural characterisation of CTFs and their catalytically active species have not been adequately demonstrated. Mild synthesis techniques are only occasionally used in the literature, and ionothermal synthesis creates most CTFs. The material may carbonise and turn black under these strong reaction conditions, making the characterisation process more difficult. Additionally, since synthesis operations take place in vacuum-sealed glass/quartz ampoules, there is a certain likelihood that an ampoule explosion will occur due to gases produced during the reaction. Before commercialization, toxicology research on CTF compounds is essential, yet none has been undertaken.131
TiO2-derived catalysts	Due to its outstanding optical and electronic properties, photoactivity, high chemical stability, low cost, non-toxicity, reusability, and eco-friendliness, titanium dioxide (TiO2) has received much attention as a photocatalyst for a long time and has been regarded as one of the most promising materials for commercial use. To enhance TiO2's performance in comparison with commercial TiO2 powders, much more focus has been placed on the various TiO2 preparation techniques.166	TiO2 has been a hot subject of several remarkable research, although there are still several obstacles in the way of its widespread use. TiO2's insufficient capacity to absorb solar energy is its fundamental flaw. The use of visible light as the light source is constrained by its broad bandgap (3.2 eV). Another drawback of TiO2 in photocatalysis is the rapid recombination of photogenerated charge carriers, which lowers the quantum efficiency of the entire reaction. The surface area of TiO2 particles can be increased by shrinking them to the nanoscale; however, this may cause aggregation, which interferes with the light incidence on the active core and lowers the catalytic activity. Additionally, a significant barrier to its practical application may be the separation, recovery, and reuse of the nanostructured TiO2.167
