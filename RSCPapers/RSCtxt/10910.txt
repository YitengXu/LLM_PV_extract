Introduction
Energy consumption has been increasing due to the modernization of society and fast development of technology. Finding inexpensive, renewable, and environment friendly energy resources has become a well-focused academic and industrial research topic.1 After the first report of Grätzel and O'Regan,2 the dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) technology has emerged as a resourceful alternative to fossil fuel energy. The design is relatively simple and is composed of five components: a semiconducting photoanode, dye sensitizer, redox mediator, counter electrode, and conducting glass substrate.3–5 Among these constituents, the sensitizing dye is considered one of the most important parts in DSSCs.6 To date, numerous sensitizers such as ruthenium complexes, non-ruthenium organometallic dyes, and metal-free organic sensitizers have been designed and their photophysical properties and device performances have been reported.7–21 Mostly, ruthenium(II) dyes such as N3,22,23N719,18,24 black dye,25,26 and other ruthenium complexes27 utilizing mainly bipyridyl ligands are known to be efficient heterogeneous charge transfer sensitizers and successful dye designs. Advancements in these molecular developments have been focused on enhancing the light harvesting properties to improve the photoelectric conversion efficiencies.28–35
Optimization of Ru(II) sensitizers has been carried out through developing different kinds of heterocyclic rings like fused pyridine, pyrimidine, pyrazine, and N-heterocyclic carbene as ancillary ligands which showed good conversion efficiencies.27,36–41 In these templates, both the donor nitrogen atoms in the ancillary ligand are part of the heterocyclic ring. Another example of a ruthenium sensitizer using a conjugated dipyridylamine ligand as an ancillary group is reported to show that an extra nitrogen atom outside the heterocycle, which is not chelated to the central metal atom, can lift up the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO).42 Moreover, studies employing pyridylimine units as ancillary ligands of ruthenium complexes have not yet been explored. Also, the effect of the cis and trans configurations of pyridylimine-based ruthenium dyes on their device performance is worth investigating.
Herein, we report two first heteroleptic ruthenium(II) complexes (IP102 and IP104) with pyridylimine ancillary ligands (Fig. 1). Our interest in ruthenium pyridylimine complexes is particularly important due to two reasons. First, metal–pyridylimine ligand complexes are commonly used as active catalyst precursors and have widespread applications.43,44 These ligands are easy to prepare and possess similar properties to the extensively explored bipyridine ligands.45
 Fig. 1  Molecular structures of IP102 and IP104. 
Similar to the ruthenium N719 dye, one of the most efficient sensitizers, metal–pyridylimine ligand complexes show low lying π orbitals46 which usually could account for good charge transfer spectra. With good redox and optical properties, these pyridylimine ligands are expected to act as excellent ancillary ligands.47 Second, the design of pyridylimine ligands can be fine-tuned with varying substitution which will allow structural engineering at the molecular level. With some appropriate structural modifications by inducing steric effects, one can manipulate the possibilities to obtain either cis- or trans-ruthenium complexes exclusively.
Results and discussion
Synthesis
The syntheses of new pyridylimine dyes IP102 and IP104 were accomplished in simple synthetic routes as depicted in Schemes 1 and 2, respectively. The condensation reaction between picolinaldehyde (2a) and 2,6-dimethylaniline (3) in the presence of ethanol and a catalytic amount of formic acid afforded ligand 4a. The ester complex 5a was obtained from the resulting ligand 4a in three consecutive steps. Imine ligand 4a was reacted with [RuCl2(p-cymene)]2 in CH2Cl2 and then with 4,4′-bis(methoxycarbonyl)-2,2′-bipyridine to yield a ruthenium–chloride complex which was treated with KSCN in a mixture of H2O and DMF at 85 °C to afford the ruthenium–thiocyanide complex 5a. Hydrolysis of the ester 5a under basic conditions of LiOH in H2O/DMF produced the desired sensitizer IP102. As shown in Scheme 2, the ligand 4b was synthesized by condensing 2-benzoylpyridine (2b) with compound 3 in the presence of p-toluenesulfonic acid (PTSA) in toluene. The complex IP104 which has an additional phenyl substitution on the imine bond was synthesized from the ligand 4b using a method similar to that described for the preparation of IP102.

X-ray crystallography
The dye IP102 with an unsubstituted imine ligand acquired the cis configuration around the ruthenium metal, confirmed by single-crystal X-ray structural analysis (Fig. 2a and Table S1†). All the Ru–N bond lengths range from 2.011 to 2.034 Å, which are in the range that has been reported for typical bis(bipyridyl)ruthenium complexes. The N(pyridine) atom of the ancillary ligand [Ru–N3, 2.034 Å] is positioned trans to the Ru–N(pyridine) bond of the anchoring ligand [Ru–N6, 2.026 Å], whereas the N(imine) atom [Ru–N4, 2.011 Å] is located trans to the NCS (2) ligand. Therefore, for the complex IP102, the majority of the electron donation might be contributed from the pyridine ring of the ancillary ligand and one of the NCS ligands. In the case of IP104, the dye having a phenyl substituted imine ligand developed a trans configured molecular arrangement around the ruthenium metal with Ru–N bond lengths ranging from 2.035–2.105 Å (Fig. 2b and Table S2†) which are longer than those of IP102. In particular, the Ru–N(imine) bond length of IP104 (Ru–N4, 2.105 Å) is higher than that of IP102 (Ru–N4, 2.011 Å), due to the steric strain induced from the additional phenyl ring of the imine ligand. Similar to the dye IP102, the N(pyridine) atom of the ancillary ligand in IP104 is located trans to the Ru–N(pyridine) bond [Ru–N6, 2.072 Å] of the anchoring ligand. However, the N(imine) atom of the IP104 dye is placed trans to the other Ru–N(pyridine) bond [Ru–N5, 2.070 Å] of the anchoring ligand, not to the NCS ligand as in the case of the sensitizer IP102, which might be beneficial for charge separation.

Optical properties
The electronic absorption spectra of IP102, IP104, and N719 in CH3CN/t-BuOH solutions are shown in Fig. 3 and the corresponding spectroscopic data are listed in Table 1. The absorption spectrum of the sensitizer IP102 showed two bands centred around 394 nm and 545 nm which are attributed to intraligand π–π* with some contribution from the metal-to-ligand charge-transfer (MLCT) band and MLCT transition, respectively. The absorption bands in the dye IP102 are red shifted relative to the standard N719 dye (381 nm and 528 nm). Surprisingly, the absorption spectrum of IP104 showed a slight red shift in the higher energy band (402 nm) while the MLCT band was blue shifted with a lower molar extinction coefficient (ε) (520 nm, ε = 0.588 × 104 M−1 cm−1), when compared to the IP102 sensitizer (545 nm, ε = 1.15 × 104 M−1 cm−1). The MLCT blue shift in the lower energy region of IP104 might be due to the decreased π back-donation from the metal Ru to bipyridine π* orbitals associated with the destabilization of the ligand based LUMO (lowest unoccupied molecular orbital).48

Electrochemical properties
In order for a dye to be utilized as a sensitizer, it is essential to have a sufficiently lower HOMO energy level than the redox potential of the electrolyte and an appropriately higher LUMO energy level than the conduction band of TiO2, for effective dye regeneration and efficient electron injection, respectively. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the pyridylimine-based dyes were measured by cyclic voltammetry (CV) in DMF solutions and UV-vis absorption spectroscopy (Fig. 3). From Table 1, the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the dye IP104 were lifted up when compared to those of IP102, which are closer to those of N719. The HOMO energy levels of these new dyes are sufficiently lower than that of the electrolyte (I−/I3−) redox couple for efficient dye regeneration of the photooxidized dye and the LUMO energy levels are appropriately higher than that of the TiO2 conduction band for facile electron injection into the semiconductor. Furthermore, the LUMO+1 energy level of IP104 (Fig. S1†) was delocalized between the anchoring and the ancillary pyridyl-imine ligands which might favor the effective charge injection into the TiO2 conduction band.
Photovoltaic performance of DSSCs
The DSSCs were fabricated using the new pyridylimine based ruthenium sensitizers and the corresponding data are presented in Table 2. The performance parameters of DSSC devices were recorded under simulated AM 1.5 illumination at 100 mW cm−2. For comparison, a device based on N719 was also studied under the same conditions. As shown in Fig. 4a, the DSSC sensitized with IP102 exhibited a short-circuit photocurrent (Jsc) of 4.75 mA cm−2, an open-circuit photovoltage (Voc) of 610 mV, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.70 corresponding to an overall conversion efficiency (η) of 2.04%. The device based on dye IP104 showed a superior power conversion efficiency of 7.27% with a Jsc of 16.50 mA cm−2, a Voc of 700 mV, and a FF of 0.63 compared to the complex IP102. The higher efficiency of the IP104-sensitized cell (relative to that of the IP102 cell) arose from its higher Jsc value. However, the overall performance of the IP104 cell was slightly lower than that of the standard N719 dye (η = 8.81%; Jsc = 18.44 mA cm−2; Voc = 740 mV and FF = 0.64). The improvements in charge separation result in an increase in Jsc, whilst the retardation in recombination dynamics should increase Voc. The device based on IP104 showed much higher Jsc than the IP102 cell which indicated that the former device has better charge separation. Such variation could be due to their different structural arrangements around the ruthenium metal (trans over cis configuration). Also, in dye IP102 the electron donation occurs mainly from the pyridine group of the ancillary ligand and one of the NCS ligands. Whereas in IP104 the electron pushing is contributed from the pyridine as well as the imine groups of the ancillary ligand (as the two NSC ligands are trans to each other) resulting in a better current density. The higher Jsc value of IP104 could also be accounted for by its two trans NCS ligands which might be placed appropriately for their ready interaction with the I−/I3− redox couple, thus speeding the regeneration process of the photooxidized dye.49 The dye IP104 with a trans geometry also showed a higher Voc value than that of the cis configured IP102, revealing that there is a major difference in their recombination dynamics. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiencies (IPCEs) of the DSSCs based on IP102, IP104 and N719 are depicted in Fig. 4b. The IPCE spectrum of the DSSC based on the IP102 sensitizer exhibited an inferior performance compared to that of the standard N719 and IP104 dyes with a value limiting to 20% in the range of 450–800 nm. The IPCE spectrum of the IP104 cell exhibited photocurrent generation near that of the N719 device, reaching a maximum value of 68% at 520 nm.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS)
In order to rationalize the difference in Jsc of pyridylimine sensitizers in detail, we performed electrochemical impedance spectroscopy under standard AM 1.5 illumination and the corresponding Nyquist plots are presented in Fig. 5. The fitted EIS data, the charge transfer resistance related to the recombination of electrons at the interface (Rk), the electron transport resistance in the photoanode (Rw), the effective rate constant for recombination (keff), the electron lifetime in the photoanode (τ), the effective electron diffusion coefficient (Deff), and the electron diffusion length (Ln) are compiled in Table 3. The radius of the semicircles in the intermediate frequency regime of the Nyquist diagram denotes the interfacial charge transfer resistances at TiO2/dyes/electrolyte. A smaller radius of the medium-frequency semicircle implies an improved rate of electron generation and transport. The significant difference in the radii of the semicircles in the EIS spectra of the DSSCs based on IP102 and IP104 reveals that the interfacial charge transfer mechanism of both the dyes is strongly influenced by their geometrical arrangement around the central ruthenium metal. As shown in Fig. 5, the device IP104 exhibited a lower electron transport resistance (Rw = 4.3 Ω) than that of the IP102 cell (Rw = 17.7 Ω), resulting in a higher photocurrent density. Also, from Table 3, the longer electron lifetime (τ = 123 ms) observed for IP104 compared to IP102 indicates an effective suppression of the back reaction of the electron with the I3− in the electrolyte, reflected in the improvement of the photovoltage. Moreover, the trend of the Voc of IP dyes and N719 was further elucidated by measuring EIS under dark conditions (Fig. S2†). Despite its inferior absorption properties, the EIS results support the higher efficiency of the IP104 cell which might be influenced by the trans geometry around the central ruthenium metal leading to better charge separation.

Conclusions
Two new ruthenium sensitizers consisting of pyridylimine ancillary ligands were designed, synthesized, and evaluated for their application in DSSCs for the first time. The pyridylimine ligands were fine-tuned by inducing steric effects to obtain two sensitizers with cis and trans geometries around the ruthenium metal and the effects of the configuration of these dyes on the device performance were scrutinized. The cell based on the IP104 sensitizer with a trans arrangement achieved an overall power conversion efficiency of 7.27% and outperformed the cell with the cis configured dye IP102. To the best of our knowledge, the IP104 cell exhibited the highest efficiency reported for the pyridylimine-based Ru(II) complexes. Overall, the easily tunable pyridylimine with extended conjugation as an ancillary ligand could be a promising alternative component to engineer ruthenium complexes to increase the conversion efficiency of DSSCs.
Experimental

The reaction mixture was refluxed under a nitrogen atmosphere for 48 h. After the reaction was completed, the solvent was evaporated and the residue was suspended in diethyl ether (50 mL). The undissolved white solid was filtered and the filtrate was evaporated under vacuum to afford a crude compound which was purified by column chromatography using ethyl acetate/dichloromethane (2:8, v/v) as an eluent to obtain the desired product 4b as a yellow solid (0.85 g, 50%) HRMS (m/z): [M + H]+ calcd for (C20H19N2): 287.1543; found, 287.1547.

Electrochemical measurement
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) analyses were performed using a CHI 627 C electrochemical analyzer (CH Instruments) and a conventional single-compartment, three-electrode cell. A glassy carbon electrode and a silver wire (Ag/AgNO3 in acetonitrile) were used as the working electrode and the reference electrode, respectively while a Pt wire was utilized as a counter-electrode. Dye solutions were prepared at a concentration of 1 × 10−3 M in DMF and a 0.1 M solution of tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate was used as the supporting electrolyte. Ferrocene was utilized as the internal reference for the calibration of the obtained redox potentials. The cyclic voltammograms of IP102, IP104 and N719 were recorded at a typical scan rate of 50 mV s−1.
Preparation of TiO2 electrodes and DSSC devices
The preparation of the TiO2 nanoparticles was carried out by a hydrothermal process as follows. The starting precursor Ti(O-Bu)4 (22.0 g) was dissolved in 2.0 M CH3COOH(aq) (108.4 mL) and then stirred vigorously for 5 days. The resulting homogeneous solution was subjected to the hydrothermal treatment in an autoclave at 200 °C for 5 h, and then the obtained TiO2 colloidal solution was centrifuged twice with ethanol. The residue was dissolved in absolute ethanol (60 mL) and the mixture was stirred vigorously followed by ultra-sonication. The resulting solution was mixed with α-terpineol (38.94 g) and a mixture of ethyl cellulose (10 cps, 2.73 g and 45 cps, 2.10 g) in anhydrous ethanol (43.5 mL) and then sonicated repeatedly. The solvent was evaporated under a reduced pressure of 70 mbar and α-TiO2 was obtained after grinding. For the preparation of the TiO2 scattering layer, in a round bottom flask, 2.0 g of QF-1125 TiO2 powder of particle size around 200–300 nm was suspended in 80 mL anhydrous ethanol. After sonication for 2 min, the above solution was combined with α-terpineol (12.98 g) and a solution of ethyl cellulose (10 cps, 0.90 g and 45 cps, 0.70 g) in anhydrous ethanol (14.4 mL). The mixture was then subjected to repeated sonication. Finally, the dispersed solution was concentrated by using an evaporator at 40 °C with 70 mbar. The QF-1125 paste was obtained after grinding by using a three roll mill grinder.
The TiO2 electrode was prepared by spreading the TiO2 paste onto fluorine-doped SnO2 conducting glass (FTO, Hartford Glass; sheet resistance: 8 Ω □−1; transmittance ≥ 80%; haze 5%). Subsequently, the TiO2 electrodes were dried in air and heated at 100 °C for 15 min, followed by annealing at 450 °C for 30 min. The TiO2 scattering layer was also coated followed by the above procedure using the QF-1125F TiO2 paste. The average thickness of the TiO2 film was 15 μm, measured using a Force EZstep profiler. The resulting TiO2 electrode was scraped to an active area of 0.25 cm2 (0.5 cm × 0.5 cm), followed by heat treatment at 80 °C. Dye solutions of N719, IP102, and IP104 with 3 × 10−4 M concentration in 1:1 CH3CN/t-BuOH (v/v) were prepared and then the electrodes were soaked for 36 h. The Pt counter electrodes were prepared by sputter-deposition of 20 nm thick Pt layers onto FTO substrates using a Hitachi E-1045 ion sputter. Prior to assembling of the DSSCs, two holes were drilled on the counter electrodes. The Pt electrodes were then placed over the dye-adsorbed TiO2 electrodes. The edges of the cells were sealed with a Surlyn 1702 (DuPont; thickness: 125 mm) spacer at 100 °C. To complete the DSSC fabrication, the electrolyte was injected into the intervening space between the TiO2 and Pt electrodes through the two holes, which were then covered with a microscope slide and sealed with a Surlyn spacer. The electrolyte solution comprised of 0.5 M lithium iodide, 0.05 M iodide, 0.5 M 1,2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide, and 0.5 M tert-butylpyridine in acetonitrile was employed as the redox mediator.
DSSC performance measurements
Photovoltaic parameters were measured by utilizing a Keithley model 2400 source unit equipped with an A-class solar simulator of a 300 W Xenon light source (Oriel, no. 91160) with an AM 1.5 filter (Oriel, no. 81094). The power of the output light at the cell measuring position was calibrated to 100 mW cm−2 using a certified reference cell (PVM134, PV Measurement, Inc.). To measure the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiencies (IPCEs), equipment comprised of a 150 W Xenon lamp source (Oriel, no. 66902), a monochromator (Oriel CornerstoneTM 130) and a Keithley model 2400 was employed.
EIS measurements
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed using an impedance analyzer (IM6ex, Zahner, Germany) under illumination conditions of 100 mW cm−2 with an ac amplitude of 10 mV and a frequency range of 10−1–105 Hz. The Z-View software was utilized for modeling and fitting the EIS data of DSSCs to obtain the electron transport parameters of the cells. The equivalent circuit (Fig. S2†) and calculations of EIS parameters are provided in the ESI.†
