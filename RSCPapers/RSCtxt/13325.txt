    , Accepted 7th March 2022First published on 9th March 2022AbstractThe urgent need for clean and renewable energy has facilitated the development of advanced energy storage systems. Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), supercapacitors (SCs) and other new energy storage technologies such as sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), potassium-ion batteries (KIBs) and lithium sulfur (Li–S) batteries meet the different requirements of high-energy density, high-power density, low cost, and large-scale energy storage, respectively.

1. Introduction
With the development of human society and economy, non-renewable resources such as coal, petroleum, and natural gas are running out, which together with the environmental degradation and ecological damage brought by the combustion of fossil fuels have caused serious problems to sustainable development.1–6 Therefore, developing clean and renewable energy becomes particularly important. People have made considerable efforts to alleviate their dependence on fossil fuels through the development and utilization of renewable energy sources such as solar energy, wind energy, and tidal energy.7–9 However, these renewable energy sources cannot be integrated into the existing power grid system directly due to their intrinsic instability and discontinuity, which necessitates the development of new and efficient energy storage devices to balance the fluctuations.10–16
In order to meet different energy storage requirements, researchers have designed and commercialized various electrochemical energy storage devices, such as lead–acid batteries, nickel–cadmium batteries, nickel–metal hydride batteries, LIBs, and SCs. Among them, LIBs have penetrated many aspects of daily life since their first commercialization in 1991, and their applications have expanded from portable electronics to electronic vehicles (EVs) because of their high energy density and long cycle life. Although LIBs are a comparatively mature technology and have been widely used in our daily life, the expectation of large-scale market penetration has raised significant concern about the high cost and limitations of lithium resources versus their massive utilization, thus leading to an irresolvable issue in the near future.17–20 In view of this, SIBs have been considered as a light of hope due to the large abundance and low cost of sodium resources as well as the similar energy storage mechanism to LIBs.21 Apart from the geopolitical and economic issues, unfortunately, LIBs are approaching the limit of their theoretical energy density, which cannot meet the ever-increasing demand for the growing EV market and the emerging modern technology powered by energy storage devices.22–24 Given all this, other alternative electrochemical energy storage devices beyond LIBs such as Li–S batteries, metal–air batteries and KIBs have also been explored to meet the various demands.25–30
In battery systems, electrode materials are the main contributors to electrochemical performances, therefore, designing and fabricating appropriate electrode materials with high specific capacity, long cycle life and low cost is of paramount importance to develop next-generation energy storage devices.31–33 In the case of LIBs, the most widely used graphite and lithium cobalt oxides (LiCoO2), which have been applied as the anode and cathode materials for commercial rechargeable LIBs for decades, cannot meet the requirements for higher output capacity owing to their low theoretical capacities of 372 and 274 mA h g−1.34 Compared to the promising candidate LIBs, SIBs are still at the experimental stage and no one has yet found the right electrode materials for real applications. Therefore, great efforts have been devoted to discovering new electrode materials with high electrochemical performance and high volume commercial applications, in which transition metal compounds (TMCs), such as oxides and sulfides, have attracted tremendous attention recently and show great potential as electrode materials due to their high theoretical capacities (Table 1).35,36 Among these TMCs, iron chalcogenides have emerged as a potential candidate for both LIB and SIB anodes because of their high theoretical capacities, abundant resources, low cost, robust nature, and versatile material species.37 However, their inferior electrochemical properties caused by sluggish kinetics and large volume changes during sodiation and desodiation greatly hinder their actual application.38–45 In addition, iron chalcogenide bulk materials with sluggish kinetics generally cause the rate of ion transport inside the material to be much less than the rate of external electron transport, which leads to polarization of the material and the consequent hysteresis of the charging/discharging profiles. Also, the initial charge/discharge process results in partial capacity loss and low initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) due to the generation of irreversible SEI films and some other side reactions. The large polarisation and low ICE are unfavorable to the performance of iron-based chalcogenide electrode materials, which seriously lead to the energy loss.

Constructing nanostructures or nano–micro multi-level structures is an efficient way to improve the energy storage performance of iron chalcogenides.46 Nano or nano–micro hybrid structures can well accommodate large volume changes during cycling without initiation of pulverization and improve the reaction kinetics by shortening the transport path for electrons and ions, thus contributing to an enhanced cycle and rate performance.47 Moreover, nanostructured materials can expose more active sites than the bulk, which promote the effective utilization of the active materials. Generally, nano-structured iron chalcogenides can provide a high specific capacity of more than 500 mA h g−1 at 0.5–1C when used as anode materials for LIBs and SIBs.48 For instance, Hu et al. synthesized a foam-like FeS2 (F-FeS2) porous nanostructure constructed from numerous interconnected small nanoparticles (∼50 nm) by combining solution combustion and solid-state reaction.49 The small particle sizes and interconnected porous structure endowed F-FeS2 with high ion diffusion kinetics, and strong ability to buffer volume expansion. Resultantly, F-FeS2 delivered a high specific capacity of 823 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 and high rate capability with 581 mA h g−1 retained at 5 A g−1. Cho et al. applied an electrospinning and subsequent sulfidation strategy to construct one dimensional (1D) porous nanofibers to improve the electrochemical performance of iron sulfides, the as-prepared FeS nanofibers showed a discharge capacity of 592 mA h g−1 after 150 cycles at a current density of 500 mA g−1.50
Hybridizing iron chalcogenides with other functional components is another way to improve their electrochemical performance. For instance, combining iron chalcogenides with graphene,51 carbon nanotubes (CNTs)52 and other conductive carbon-based materials not only buffers the large volume expansion effectively during charge and discharge, but also improves the conductivity of the entire electrode, thereby ameliorating the cycle stability and rate performance significantly. Huang et al. prepared iron sulfides and carbon composites with mesoporous iron-sulfide nanorods combined with carbon/graphene double encapsulation.53 The mesoporous structure combined with double-carbon protection offered perfect ionic/electronic circuits for electron/Na+ diffusion and robust structures to buffer large volume changes. As a result, this hybrid structure delivered a high specific capacity of 567.6 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1, high rate capability with a capacity retention of 323.5 mA h g−1 at 5 A g−1 and long cycle stability with 0.015% capacity decay per cycle until 1700 cycles. Liu et al. synthesized unique FeS2@C yolk–shell nanoboxes using an in situ carbon coating method combined with a subsequent etching process.54 The as-prepared yolk–shell structure exhibited excellent rate capabilities and long cycle performances arising from the high structural stability and conductivity of the carbon shell and the sufficient void space between the yolk and shell. Pan et al. designed a heterostructured Fe1−xS@S-doped carbon hollow sphere (Fe1−xS@SC) for the anode material of SIBs.55 This heterostructure greatly inhibited the continuous dissolution of sulfur in the electrolyte and effectively buffered the large volume expansion during the charge and discharge processes, thus exhibiting excellent sodium storage performance. The Fe1−xS@SC hollow spheres demonstrated a high reversible capacity of 454.3 mA h g−1 at 1.0 A g−1 after 500 cycles. Apart from carbonaceous materials, various functional materials such as titanium oxides have also been combined with iron chalcogenides, and most of them showed improved electrochemical performance compared with the pure chalcogenides.56–59
At present, there has been a great deal of research on iron-based materials and there is no doubt that great research efforts will be devoted towards these rich and cheap electrode materials, but the exploration of iron chalcogenides is still in the early stages. In order to explore the potential of iron chalcogenide materials completely in the energy storage field, we should fully understand their fundamentals, which include their properties, optimization solution, energy storage mechanism, and kinds of applications. Therefore, real-time reviews of the state-of-the-art progress and challenges in the research of iron chalcogenides are needed to point the way. Recently, several review articles have considered some iron-based materials for rechargeable batteries, but only for one section or single application.60 To the best of our knowledge, there is scarcely a comprehensive review currently that summarizes the research progress of iron chalcogenides to various energy storage devices systematically. In this review, we consider summarizing iron chalcogenides and their composites from the perspective of energy storage applications including LIBs, SIBs, KIBs, Li–S batteries and SCs, in particular, with respect to the relationship between the electrochemical properties and their components and microstructures. Given that iron oxides show very different behavior from other chalcogenides, only S, Se and Te-based chalcogenides will be considered in this review. Firstly, the synthesis strategies of iron chalcogenides and the associated structures and properties are discussed. Subsequently, the energy storage mechanism of iron chalcogenides is mainly summarized. Moreover, the state-of-the-art research progress with respect to LIBs, SIBs, KIBs, Li–S batteries and SCs is outlined in detail, as shown in Fig. 1. Finally, we present the challenges and likely solutions, and future perspectives for iron chalcogenides as potential electrode candidates. This review is expected to offer valuable references in view of demonstrating representative cases covering the application of iron chalcogenides in energy storage devices.

2. Synthesis strategy of iron-chalcogenide-based composites
2.1. Hydrothermal/solvothermal methods
Hydrothermal/solvothermal methods are the most widely used approach for synthesizing nanostructured materials at high pressure and moderate temperature owing to their facile synthetic process and low cost. The nanomaterials synthesized by this method have the advantages of high phase purity, high crystallinity and narrow particle size distribution.61,62 These methods are also applied broadly to prepare different kinds of iron chalcogenides with various nanostructures, for example, rose-like Fe7S8,63 Fe7S8@C nanorods,64 iron sulfides/rGO,65 micro-spherical FeS2/CNT powder,66 FeS2@C nanowires,67 Fe7Se8@C@MoSe2 composite,58etc.
Using the one-step hydrothermal method, Song's group successfully synthesized rose-like iron sulfide (S-Fe7S8) composed of very large and thin nanoplates with PVP-K30 as the shaping agent (Fig. 2a and b).63 The large space structure between the nanoplates had a self-buffering effect on the large volume changes in the process of sodiation and desodiation. Besides, the two-dimensional (2D) nanoplates provided sufficient contact area between the active materials and the electrolyte and shortened the transport path of sodium ions and electrons, which facilitated the kinetics of the charge and discharge processes greatly. Zhang and co-workers prepared 1D Fe7S8@C nanorods using the hydrothermal method associated with the carbon coating process.64 As shown in Fig. 2c, the precursor of the Fe7S8 nanorods was initially synthesized through a hydrothermal method and then the Fe7S8 nanorods were coated with a polydopamine (PDA) layer. After calcination, uniform 1D Fe7S8@C nanorod composites were formed (Fig. 2d). With the assistance of the carbon layer, the 1D structure well maintained the structural stability during cycling. Guo's group combined binary sulfides (FeS2 microspheres and Fe3S4 microcubes) with reduced graphene oxide (rGO) by a simple in situ hydrothermal method (Fig. 2e).65 During the hydrothermal process, GO acted as a surfactant and an accelerator to accelerate the reaction of the sulfur source (L-cysteine) with Fe2+/Fe3+ ions to produce FeS2 and Fe3S4. At the same time, GO was reduced to rGO at high temperatures. Besides, rGO can effectively prevent the agglomeration of FeS2 and Fe3S4 during both synthesis and cycling processes. Liu and colleagues synthesized FeS2/CNT micro-spheres (2–3 μm) shown in Fig. 2f by a facile hydrothermal method.66 Carbon nanotubes helped to maintain the spherical shape of FeS2 and improve the overall conductivity of the material. Zhang's group synthesized 1D FeS2 nanowires wrapped by thin carbon layers.67 Firstly, the hybrid S-amine FeS2-amine (SAFA) nanowire precursor was obtained by the hydrothermal method as displayed in Fig. 2g. Subsequently, the precursor was calcined to form FeS2@C nanowires. The advantages of high conductivity of the thin amorphous carbon layer and short ion transport path of the 1D structure are fully exploited in improving the electrochemical performance. In addition to the one-step hydrothermal method, indirect synthesis through sulfidation/selenization/tellurization of the iron oxides is also a common method for the preparation of iron-chalcogenide-based materials. Zhu et al. prepared iron oxide nanobiscuits by a one-step hydrothermal method, followed by surface coating with a layer of dopamine hydrochloride. The Fe7S8@C nanobiscuits were successfully prepared by thermally induced sulfidation, and they exhibited high specific capacity, excellent rate performance and stable cycling stability as anodes for LIBs and SIBs.68 Chen et al. used a novel stress-release strategy to fabricate yolk–shell Fe7Se8@C@MoSe2 composites.58 As displayed in Fig. 2h–k, MoS2 was initially inserted into the surface of the obtained Fe3O4@C yolk–shell composites through a solvothermal method. Subsequently, an Fe7Se8@C@MoSe2 composite was obtained after selenization in a H2/Ar atmosphere. Finite element (FE) simulation showed that the MoSe2 layer could effectively alleviate the fracture of the carbon layer by using a carbon and MoSe2 double buffering mechanism. The Fe7Se8@C@MoSe2 composite combined the advantages of strong structural stability, high electrical conductivity and fast charge transfer organically.

2.2. Spray pyrolysis method
Spray pyrolysis technology has experienced decades of development, and is now widely used in electronics, energy, chemical and pharmaceutical fields. The nanomaterials prepared by spray pyrolysis have the advantages of small particle size, uniform particle size distribution and large specific surface area.69 Therefore, this method has been applied to the preparation of iron-chalcogenide-based composites.
For example, Kim and co-workers used spray pyrolysis and a single-step sulfidation process to prepare multi-component metal sulfide (Fe0.5Ni0.5)9S8 solid solution powder.70 The obtained core–shell structure remained intact after complete sulfidation. It was clear that a core was surrounded by two layers of shells and the size of the yolk–shell powder depended on the size of the droplet. The double shell structure further enhanced the structural stability of the material. Kang et al. prepared Fe2O3–C–NaCl composite microspheres by one-pot ultrasonic spray pyrolysis from an aqueous solution containing iron nitrate, NaCl salt (pore forming agent), and dextrin (carbon source) as shown in Fig. 3a. In order to transform Fe2O3 into hollow FeSe2 (Fig. 3b), a two-step (carbonization and selenization) post-treatment was applied to the Fe2O3/C microspheres. The obtained H-FeSe2/GC provided large amounts of conductive channels to promote ion/electron transport and enhanced the mechanical strength.71 Park et al. successfully synthesized a new type of multi-component (Ni–Fe, graphitic carbon, CNTs), multi-cavity mixed microspheres ((NiFe)Sex-GC-CNTs) by spray pyrolysis.72 As displayed in Fig. 3c, phase segregation and the decomposition of dextrin resulted in multi chamber microspheres with uniformly distributed empty nanovoids in the spray pyrolysis process. In the process of selenization, nanocrystals of iron and nickel were produced, which could be used as a catalyst to convert amorphous carbon into graphite carbon and further form a uniform carbon skeleton in multi-chamber microspheres to improve the conductivity and structural stability. Cho's group initially prepared an Fe3O4–rGO mixed precursor powder by spray pyrolysis using iron nitrate and GO as raw materials.73 As shown in Fig. 3d, the formation of rGO by thermal reduction of GO could limit the growth of Fe3O4 nanocrystals (formed by decomposition of iron nitrate in an Ar atmosphere). In addition, the Fe3O4 nanocrystals were uniformly distributed in the rGO matrix. Finally, the FeTe2–rGO hybrid powder was formed by a tellurization process (Fig. 3e).

2.3. Electrospinning
Electrospinning is a special fiber manufacturing process. The nanofibers obtained by electrospinning have the characteristics of large specific surface area, high porosity, easy size control and surface functionalization (coating or modification), and have been widely used in various fields.74 With regard to energy storage materials, electrospinning was often used to design nano-porous materials with fibrous or tubular morphologies. For instance, Joo and co-workers prepared FeS@carbon nanofibers (CNFs) by electrospinning.75 Sulfur was first dispersed in the prepared polymer solution, and then the new nanofiber felt was prepared via electrospinning. During the subsequent heat treatment, the metal salts reacted with the sulfur to form metal sulfides, and the polyacrylonitrile (PAN) polymer framework was transformed into CNFs simultaneously. The three-dimensional (3D) conductive network composed of 1D nanofibers ensured the excellent electron transport of the whole electrode. A large number of pores contributed to the rapid penetration of the electrolyte, making it easy and fast for lithium ions to approach individual particles. Haridas et al. reported the synthesis of iron sulfide (FeS) nanoparticles decorated in a sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) hybrid nanofiber matrix (FeS/SPAN-HNF) as a flexible and freestanding material for the SIB anode.76 They initially prepared a PAN fiber membrane decorated with Fe2O3 nanoparticles by using the electrospinning process (Fig. 4a). The as-spun orange membrane was then soaked into a S/CS2 solution to facilitate sulfur impregnation. The sulfurization process was finally conducted at high temperature, in which the embedded Fe2O3 nanoparticles reacted with the melted sulfur and the excess sulfur was linked to the carbon atom in a polypyridine ring backbone covalently to form a black flexible FeS/SPAN-HNF mat. Chen and colleagues constructed graphene-coated FeS2 nanoparticles encapsulated in carbon nanofibers (FeS2@G@CNF) by the electrospinning method and a subsequent oxidation and sulfidation process.77 The TEM image obviously revealed that the fibers had a diameter of around 300 nm and a smooth surface (Fig. 4b). The HRTEM images clearly exhibited the graphene-encapsulated FeS2 particles in carbon nanofibers with obvious lattice fringes of (211) and (210) planes of FeS2 (Fig. 4c and d).

2.4. Other methods
In addition to the above strategies, other effective approaches for synthesizing nanostructures have been proposed. In this section, we will introduce some other typical synthesis methods.
Freeze drying uses the principle of ice crystal sublimation and doesn't change the chemical composition or physical properties (porous structure or colloid property) of the materials. This method is often used in the preparation of iron-based electrode materials. For example, Xu's group used an easy freeze-drying/carbonization method with NaCl as a template to evenly insert FeS nanoparticles (20 nm) into carbon nanosheets to obtain interconnected porous FeS/C composites (FeS@CNS, Fig. 4e).78 These carbon nanosheets were interconnected together to form porous networks and FeS nanoparticles (around 20 nm) were uniformly anchored on the carbon nanosheets (Fig. 4f and g). Resultantly, the FeS@CNS composite demonstrated fast electrochemical reaction kinetics and efficient volume-buffering effect during charge and discharge processes. Lv et al. prepared an iron alginate aerogel with a macroporous structure by freeze-drying with sodium alginate (SA) and FeCl3 as precursors.79 In the freezing process, dendritic ice crystals grew along the thermal gradient through the ferric alginate gel, and the ferric alginate film was concentrated between the ice crystals. After sublimation, the ferric alginate hydrogel was transformed into a 3D porous structure of ferric alginate aerogel. Subsequent carbonization and selenization resulted in the formation of FeSe and carbon nanofiber aerogel (CNFA) (Fig. 4h).
Selective etching is one of the common methods to synthesize materials with hollow, yolk–shell and porous structures controllably and effectively. The obtained morphologies and structures can well alleviate the volume expansion of active materials in the process of charge and discharge, which is beneficial for cycling stability. In addition, the reduced diffusion paths for electrons and metal ions significantly enhance the rate capability. For example, Paik's group used a selective etching method associated with a liquid–sulfidation process to prepare yolk–shell FeS2@C nanoboxes (Fig. 4i and j).54 The uniform Fe2O3 nanocubes as templates were initially coated with polydopamine (Fe2O3@PDA) and then annealed to transform Fe2O3@PDA into an Fe3O4@C core–shell structure. In the following step, HCl acid solution was used to partially remove the Fe3O4 core to form a yolk–shell structure. It is worth noting that the void space between the carbon shell and the etched Fe3O4 core could be adjusted by changing the etching time. An optimized void space was formed by etching the Fe3O4@C core–shell sample for 45 min (denoted as Fe3O4@C-45), which provided sufficient space to accommodate the large volume expansion during both sulfidation process and sodiation/desodiation processes, contributing to the high structural stability. Fig. 4i and j show the unique yolk–shell structure with the FeS2 core size around 320 nm. An inner cavity was clearly seen in the FeS2 core, implying that the etching reaction occurred from outside and inside simultaneously. With the advantages of carbon shells to enhance the conductivity, structure and chemical stability, FeS2 cores to deliver high specific capacity, and void space to buffer the large volume changes, the yolk–shell FeS2@C structure showed high specific capacity, excellent rate capability, and long cycle stability in SIBs.
Besides the typical synthesis methods mentioned above, other methods such as co-precipitation, ball milling, and solid-state reactions for preparing various iron-chalcogenide-based electrode materials have been summarized in Table 2. As can be seen, the hydrothermal/solvothermal method, electrospinning, sintering/heat-treatment, and spray pyrolysis were the most widely used strategies for the synthesis of different kinds of iron-chalcogenide-based electrode materials owing to their facile synthetic processes and cost-efficient feature. The diversity of synthetic methods ensures the diversity of the structure and morphology for iron-chalcogenide-based electrode materials, which makes it possible to find suitable iron-based electrode materials in practical applications.

3. Energy storage mechanisms in LIBs/SIBs
Iron-chalcogenide-based (FenQm, Q = S, Se, Te) materials have high theoretical capacities owing to multi-electron transfer reactions, which make them promising electrode materials for LIBs/SIBs. A large number of studies have shown that iron-chalcogenide-based materials can store alkaline ions through an electrochemical conversion mechanism similar to that of transition metal oxides. However, the Fe–Q bonds in iron chalcogenides are usually weaker than the corresponding Fe–O bonds in iron oxides, which can be kinetically favorable for conversion reactions. Generally, phase transition and structural evolution occur during conversion reactions of iron-chalcogenide-based materials, resulting in the formation of new phases through the fracture and reforming of chemical bonds. As a consequence, large volume expansion often occurs during lithiation and sodiation.47,178
Because the energy storage mechanisms of iron chalcogenides in LIBs and SIBs are similar, the mechanism study on FenQm in LIBs is chosen as an example here. The commonly accepted storage mechanisms for iron-chalcogenide-based materials in LIBs and SIBs are shown in eqn (3.1), (3.2) and (3.3).132,144,155,177,179 FenQm + xLi+ + xe− ↔ LixQm + nFe(3.1)
In fact, the reaction process has been widely recognized as a two-step reaction, in which the intercalation reaction occurs at the early stage of the lithiation process. The reversible two-stage reactions could be deduced as the following equations given below, taking FeS2 as an example, while Li2FeS2 is the intermediate product of the intercalation reaction. The overall theoretical capacity of FeS2 can be calculated to be 894 mA h g−1 based on these reactions. FeS2 + 2Li+ + 2e− ↔ Li2FeS2(3.2) Li2FeS2 + 2Li+ + 2e− ↔ 2Li2S + Fe(3.3)
However, Liu and Wang et al. reported that the delithiation reaction is a more complicated process than lithiation. Instead of reforming the pristine cubic-FeS2, elemental sulfur, nonstoichiometric pyrrhotite-FeSy and orthorhombic-FeS2 (marcasite) were produced according to the following reactions:144,155 Fe + 2Li2S → Li2FeS2 + 2Li+ + 2e−(3.4) Li2FeS2 → Li2−xFeS2 + xLi+ + xe− (0.5 < x < 0.8)(3.5) Li2−xFeS2 → 0.8ortho − FeS2 + 0.2FeS8/7 + 0.175S + (2 − x)Li+ + (2 − x)e− (x > 0.8)(3.6)
Similarly, the charge and discharge processes of FeSe2 in SIBs are summarized as follows.135,146,180
Discharge process: FeSe2 + xNa+ + xe− → NaxFeSe2(3.7) NaxFeSe2 + (2 − x)Na+ + (2 − x)e− → FeSe + Na2Se(3.8) FeSe + 2Na+ + 2e− → Fe + Na2Se(3.9)
Charge process: Fe + 2Na2Se → NaxFeSe2 + (4 − x)Na+ + (4 − x)e−(3.10) NaxFeSe2 → FeSe2 + xNa++ xe−(3.11)
Niu et al. and Huang et al. used CVs, ex situ XRD and HRTEM techniques to study the sodium storage mechanism for Fe7Se8 (Fig. 5a–d).124,157 Based on the redox peaks of CVs and XRD patterns of charge/discharge products at different voltage stages, it was demonstrated that the sodiation and desodiation processes were reversible with Nax+yFeSe2 as an intermediate, which was consistent with the reaction mechanism described above.

4. Applications of Fe-chalcogenide-based electrode materials
4.1. LIBs/SIBs

4.1.1. Iron sulfides. 
Iron has extremely rich resources in the earth and has been widely used in human civilization. Compared with other metals, the price of iron is relatively low and its application in energy storage devices can greatly reduce the cost. It is well known that sulfides tend to have relatively higher conductivity and smaller volume expansion during cycling than the corresponding oxides, which endow iron sulfides with better rate capabilities and longer cycle life.181,182 The high theoretical capacity, very low cost and non-toxic nature make iron sulfides very promising low-cost energy storage electrode materials. At present, the main types of iron sulfides are FeS, FeS2, Fe3S4, Fe7S8 and Fe1−xS, etc., all of which have shown very promising electrochemical performances in LIBs and SIBs, as can be seen in Table 3.

4.1.1.1. FeS. 
FeS is a dark brown hexagonal crystal, which can be obtained by the eutectic fusion of Fe and S in a high vacuum quartz sealing tube with the reaction equation Fe + S → FeS under the condition of heating. The FeS thus produced is more expensive as a chemical reagent. To reduce the cost, Liu and co-workers used a facile solution-based approach to prepare mackinawite FeS microsheet networks directly on iron foil under the action of ethylenediamine.81 A cross-sectional FESEM image in Fig. 6a clearly showed that the FeS microsheets grew up from the Fe substrate directly and vertically with a height of 20–25 μm. The 2D structure greatly reduced the lithium ion diffusion length and offered sufficient contact area with the electrolyte, which greatly enhanced the reaction kinetics (Fig. 6b). The as-prepared active material demonstrated promising lithium storage capacity, with a discharge capacity of 772 mA h g−1 in the first cycle at 100 mA g−1 and an ICE up to 87.9% (Fig. 6c). The improved lithium storage performance was attributed to the unique structure of FeS microsheet networks, which greatly shortened the ionic diffusion length and provided a sufficient electrode–electrolyte contact area for lithium storage reaction. In addition, the in situ growth of microsheet networks on the current collector resulted in good electrical contact of the microsheet and the current collector, which was conducive to electron diffusion and structural stability. Correspondingly, the shape of CV peaks for FeS microsheet networks was sharp and intense, reflecting the low overall resistance and higher redox reaction efficiency. Kang and co-workers synthesized FeS nanofibers containing a large number of nanopores through electrospinning and subsequent vulcanization strategies, which showed excellent sodium ion storage properties.50 It exhibited higher reversibility than hollow Fe2O3 nanofibers during the first two charge/discharge cycles with an ICE of 81%. FeS porous nanofibers had a relatively good capacity retention of 592 mA h g−1 after 150 cycles at a current density of 500 mA g−1. In the rate performance test, when the current density increased from 0.2 A g−1 to 5 A g−1, the discharge capacity decreased gradually from 456 mA h g−1 to 353 mA h g−1, and it could be resumed to the origin value when the current density returned to 0.2 A g−1, showing excellent rate performance. Mao et al. successfully synthesized 3D mesoporous flowerlike iron sulfide (F-FeS) via a facile one-step sulfurization process and used it in LIBs (Fig. 6d and e).130 CVs in Fig. 6f revealed the typical cathodic and anodic peaks of FeS materials. A peak located at 0.75 V presented the formation of a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer, which then disappeared in the following cycles. The cathodic peak at 1.23 V and anodic peak at 1.94 V in the initial cycle were attributed to the conversion reaction between FeS and Li and the oxidation of Fe to Li2−xFeS2 (0 < x < 2), respectively. In the second cycle, the cathodic peak shifted to 1.34 V from 1.23 V, which was mainly attributed to stress/strain and structural changes caused upon the initial conversion reactions. The overlapped CV curves in the following cycles demonstrated the good reversibility and cycling stability of 3D F-FeS. Benefitting from the unique flower-like structure with numerous mesopores in the range of 3–20 nm, 3D F-FeS had the ability to alleviate the volume expansion during the lithium storage process effectively, which significantly improved its lithium storage performance. Specifically, it exhibited improved cycle stability with a discharge capacity of 890 mA h g−1 after 100 charge and discharge cycles at 1 A g−1.

In addition to these well-designed iron sulfides with unique structures, there were many corresponding composite materials reported. A considerable number of previous studies have been reported in which iron sulfides were combined with carbon materials, showing much better electrochemical performance than pure iron sulfides. Liu and colleagues developed a simple, low-cost, and efficient method to prepare FeS@C particles.136 Through direct pyrolysis of iron(III) p-toluenesulfonate hexahydrate, FeS nanoparticles were confined in amorphous carbon. The obtained composite material had a unique multi-layer porous structure, which could improve the ion transport kinetics greatly, thereby resulting in excellent lithium storage performance. An interconnected porous FeS/C composite consisting of carbon nanosheets anchored with well-dispersed FeS nanoparticles was synthesized via a facile freeze-drying/carbonization method using NaCl as the template.78 The as-prepared FeS@CNS showed significantly enhanced lithium storage performance due to the synergistic effects of the conductive carbon film and the porous structure, which provided an ideal conductive matrix and buffer spaces for electron/ion transfer and volume expansion, respectively. As a result, this composite provided good cycle performance (703 mA h g−1 after 150 cycles at 1 A g−1) (Fig. 7a), high rate capability (532 mA h g−1 at 5 A g−1), and low charge transfer resistance. Yan et al. used 1-dodecanethiol as both sulfur source and surfactant to prepare ultrathin FeS nanosheets and carbon composites (C@FeS) via a controlled soft-template method.100 C@FeS showed excellent lithium insertion and extraction capabilities, especially at high current rates. As the current density increased from 0.1 A g−1 to 6 A g−1, the discharge capacity decreased from 630 mA h g−1 to 266 mA h g−1. The decent rate performance is mainly due to the small grains and ultrathin thickness, which provided a larger contact area with the electrolyte and effectively shortened the lithium ion diffusion path. It also exhibited reasonable cycle stability with high discharge capacity retention of 615 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at 0.1 A g−1. Luo and co-workers proposed a facile direct-precipitation approach to wrap FeS nanoparticles in rGO to obtain an FeS@rGO nanocomposite.164 The obtained structure not only reduced the particle size of FeS, but also improved the conductivity of the entire electrode as well as maintained the structural integrity. Compared with pure FeS anodes, FeS@rGO had a discharge capacity of 618 mA h g−1 after 30 charge–discharge cycles at 300 mA g−1, which was much higher than that of FeS (382 mA h g−1).

Chen's group constructed yolk–shell FeS@mesoporous carbon spheres through a one-pot coating strategy and a subsequent sulfidation process.109 The single crystalline FeS yolk had a diameter of ∼120 nm and contained a void space around ∼40 nm inside. This unique yolk–shell structure provided sufficient buffer space for the volume changes of FeS, and the uniform carbon shell could improve the conductivity, while the mesopores greatly enhanced sodium ion transport (Fig. 7b). Tong and co-workers used MOF as a self-sacrificing template to prepare flower-like FeS/C composites through dopamine hydrochloride (DA) coating, hydrothermal sulfurization and thermal reduction processes.91 By exploring the different coating contents of DA, it was found that the composite material with a DA content of 0.2625 g had the best electrochemical performance. When applied in LIBs, the first discharge capacity was 1217.2 mA h g−1 with a corresponding ICE of 81.9%. At a current density of 1 A g−1, this flower-like FeS/C composite showed a high capacity of 768.2 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles. FeS/C also exhibited good sodium storage performance, and the capacity could be stabilized at a high discharge capacity of 525 mA h g−1 at 500 mA g−1. The excellent performance of the flower-like FeS/C composite material was related to carbon coating and the stable thin layer structure.
Based on the merits of introduced carbon, applying a cut-off voltage limitation strategy can further improve the energy storage performance of FeS. Yang et al. synthesized FeS nanocrystals embedded in a 3D carbon network (FeS@C) anode material using a simple carbothermal reduction method.175 It can be seen that the FeS nanocrystals with a diameter of 100–300 nm were wrapped by in situ generated carbon shell (Fig. 7c and d), which prevented the aggregation of FeS effectively. The ex situ XRD patterns of FeS@C at the fully charged state after the 1st and 100th cycles were tested to explore the influence of voltage windows on the sodium storage mechanism and the reversibility (Fig. 7e and f). It showed that Na+ reactions were highly reversible when the voltage windows became narrow as the conversion reaction was partially involved. With the modified voltage window, the as-prepared FeS@C demonstrated a long cycle life in SIBs. The discharge capacities were 479.1 mA h g−1 and 407.2 mA h g−1 at the first and 500th cycles at 2 A g−1, respectively. It even maintained a high specific capacity of 280.1 mA h g−1 at a high current rate of 10 A g−1 after 3000 cycles. Its excellent long cycle life was attributed to the carbon network and suitable voltage range, which could effectively alleviate the volume expansion upon cycling. Ahn et al. reported a simple, green strategy that facilitated the in situ generation of FeS nanoparticles within graphitic carbon capsules (FeS@GCC).118 Unlike previous strategies, this method used an eco-friendly strategy with waste biomass as the raw material. The as-obtained FeS@GCC was tested within a narrow voltage range of 1–3 V and showed stable cycling performance with a high cycle capacity of 370 mA h g−1 maintained after 500 cycles.
Moreover, many researchers have used heteroatoms (N, S, O, B, P, etc.) to functionalize carbon and iron sulfide composites. Iron sulfide compounded with a heteroatom-containing carbon matrix can enhance the interface stability and electronic conductivity, thus exhibiting more enhanced electrochemical performance than the previous carbon composites.55,183–185 Mai et al. confined FeS porous nanowires in an N-doped carbon matrix through a simple amine-assisted solvothermal reaction and subsequent calcination strategy.116 The synergetic strategy of combining porous nanowires with N-doped carbon had great potential to solve the problem of volume expansion and low conductivity of metal sulfide anode materials. When used as an LIB anode, it exhibited ultrahigh reversible capacity of 1061 mA h g−1 after 500 charge and discharge cycles at 1 A g−1. In order to mitigate the volume change and dissolution of polysulfide in the electrolyte, Ahn and colleagues designed a hybrid anode material with FeS nanoparticles decorated in a sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) fiber matrix.76 Unlike previous strategies, this design used the electrochemically active material SPAN as a bifunctional matrix, which effectively buffered volume expansion and suppressed sulfur dissolution during cycling. What's more, the as-prepared electrode showed a flexible self-supporting feature, which could avoid the use of current collectors, binders and conductive agents, thus increasing the energy density and showing excellent electrochemical performance. Kim and co-workers designed a 3D hierarchical honey comb-like FeS/N,S-doped carbon nanoparticles encapsulated by dual heteroatoms (N,S) doped carbon nanostructures.117 Thanks to the presence of both N-functionalities (particularly pyridinic-N) and sulfur groups on the carbon framework, it promoted the adsorption of Li+, as well as enhancement of the stability of the SEI layer during the continuous charge–discharge cycle, the composite showed great electrochemical performance.
In addition to compounding with carbon materials, many researchers have compounded iron sulfide with other components such as transition metal sulfides and oxides. Due to the synergy effect between different metal ions, the energy storage kinetics is greatly improved. In addition, these composites had richer redox reactions and higher electrical and ionic conductivity, resulting in more promising electrochemical performance.186,187 Sun and co-workers prepared FeS/ZnS composites with different Fe/Zn ratios using simple wet chemical methods by adjusting multiple components (Fig. 7g).162 When the Fe/Zn ratio was 1:1, the as-prepared FeS/ZnS composite exhibited optimal nanoflower morphology. It provided sufficient electrode/electrolyte contact area, reaction sites, and free space to accommodate the volume expansion during discharge and charge, and shortened the Na+ diffusion path, thereby exhibiting a long cycle life and rate performance. Guo and colleagues developed a sulfidation strategy associated with the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method to prepare a 3D interconnected FeS@Fe3C@graphite carbon composite.153 Benefiting from the catalytic effect in the CVD process, the double-layered Fe3C/GC shell structure and the 3D-GC network were successfully constructed, which provided a favorable channel for fast ion transport. With the merits of the structure, this composite showed enhanced sodium storage properties, which maintained a discharge capacity of 575.7 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at 100 mA g−1. Liu et al. synthesized a uniform nanotube-structured FeS@TiO2@C composite using metal–organic framework (Fe-MOF) rods as the self-support template.57 This carbon-coated hollow nanostructure could effectively buffer the volume expansion, improve the conductivity, and provide more channels and active sites. Therefore, this ternary FeS@-TiO2@C nanotube delivered high reversible capacities of 387, 390, 376, 348, 325 and 286 mA h g−1 at 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2 and 5 A g−1, respectively (Fig. 7h).
4.1.1.2. FeS2. 
Pyrite FeS2 is a yellow cubic crystal and an attractive environmentally friendly anode electrode material with a theoretical capacity of up to 890 mA h g−1.188–190 Zhang et al. synthesized FeS2 nanoparticles with an orthorhombic crystalline structure in colloidal solution via a hot-injection protocol for the first time.176 The FeS2 nanoparticles had good dispersibility in non-polar solvents and exhibited low electrochemical resistance and high activity in the lithiation/delithiation cycling process. After 100 cycles, it delivered a high discharge capacity of 641 mA h g−1. Hu and colleagues synthesized FeS2 microspheres using a simple solvothermal method and applied it to SIBs.103 They used ex situ XRD, HRTEM, SAED and synchrotron X-ray absorption spectroscopy techniques to explore the energy storage mechanism of FeS2 and the influence of cut-off voltage and electrolyte on the electrochemical performance during sodiation and desodiation processes (Fig. 8a–e). They found that the cut-off voltage played a key role in improving the cyclability because only the intercalation reaction occurred when the cut-off voltage was adjusted to 0.8 V, which avoided the huge volume change caused by the conversion reaction, hence resulting in unprecedented long-term cycle stability. In addition, the pseudocapacitive reaction enabled FeS2 with unprecedented high-rate capability. As a result, FeS2 microsphere based batteries could be cycled for 20000 cycles with a high capacity retention of 90% at a current density of 1 A g−1. Moreover, the stable capacity of 170 mA h g−1 could still be maintained even at a high current density of 20 A g−1.

Consistent with the problems of FeS, FeS2 also experiences serious volume expansion during charge and discharge processes, which facilitates the introduction of carbonaceous materials into electrode materials. Han and co-workers successfully synthesized FeS2 nanocrystals in hierarchical porous carbon (HPC) using the double template method.134 The obtained FeS2@HPC composite had micro-porous shells and inter-connected macro-porous carbon capsules. HPC could suppress the growth of FeS2 nanocrystals, improve the conductivity of the electrode material, and also alleviate the large volume change during the lithiation/delithiation processes, which contributed to an excellent electrochemical performance. Zhang et al. successfully prepared a 1D composite structure with graphene-coated FeS2 embedded into carbon nanofibers (FeS2@G@CNF) using the electrospinning method.77 With the merits of graphene coating and 1D carbon nanofibers, FeS2 exhibited high reversibility and improved conductivity during sodiation/desodiation processes. In the rate performance test at 0.1–3 A g−1, there was no obvious difference between FeS2@G@CNF and FeS2@CNF at low current density, but when the current increased to 2 and 3 A g−1, FeS2@G@CNF with graphene coating showed much better performance. In addition, FeS2@G@CNF showed great long cycle performance at 3 A g−1 with a stable discharge capacity of 305.5 mA h g−1 maintained after 2450 cycles. Furthermore, benefitting from the enhanced conductivity and protection of graphene, the composites exhibited excellent electrochemical performance at low temperature (−20 °C) (Fig. 8f). Guo and colleagues used a hydrothermal method to encapsulate walnut-like FeS2 microspheres in rGO to prepare FeS2@rGO composite.87 Compared with pure FeS2, the addition of rGO made FeS2 microspheres possess a smaller particle size and better dispersion. When tested as anode materials in LIBs, FeS2@rGO delivered a high discharge capacity of 1131 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at 100 mA g−1. Paik's group developed a facile etching method coupled with a novel sulfidation-in-nanobox strategy to synthesize a unique structure of FeS2@C yolk–shell nanoboxes.54 Compared with the unetched FeS2@C-0, FeS2@C-45 had sufficient space between the FeS2 core and the carbon shell to buffer the large volume expansion during the charge and discharge processes, thereby effectively alleviating the problem of rapid capacity fading. What's more, the outer carbon shells not only improved the overall conductivity of the composite, but also helped in the formation of a stable SEI layer quickly during cycling. Thanks to its elaborate yolk–shell nanoarchitecture, the as-obtained FeS2@C nanoboxes revealed excellent sodium storage performance. Within a voltage window of 0.1–2 V, FeS2@C-45 maintained a high discharge capacity of 511 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at 100 mA g−1 and a stable capacity of 330 mA h g−1 after 800 cycles at 2 A g−1. In addition, the as-prepared FeS2@C yolk–shell structure delivered much higher rate capacities than the corresponding core–shell sample owing to its relatively high reaction kinetics (Fig. 8g).
A method to prepare FeS2/CNT composites by encapsulating FeS2 nanoparticles into CNTs through a confinement reaction was proposed by Li and colleagues.171 Compared with the mechanically mixed FeS2/CNT composite, it showed more remarkable lithium storage performance, which mainly resulted from its encapsulated structure so that the adjacent FeS2 nanoparticles had sufficient space to buffer the volume expansion generated by the cycling process. Zhang et al. applied a simple and scalable mechanical alloying (MA) approach to grow FeS2 on turbostratic carbon (t-carbon) with a trace amount of CNTs by chemical interactions between Fe and C electrons.149 The obtained FeS2@CNT composite exhibited an intertwined structure within a grain composed of chemical bonds formed by electronic hybridization between FeS2 and its adjacent carbon layer, which effectively improved the structural stability of the composite. Therefore, FeS2@CNTs showed a high specific capacity of 410 mA h g−1 after 250 cycles at 1 A g−1, while the mechanically mixed FeS2/CNT composite showed faster capacity decay. The high-rate performance of FeS2@CNTs is understood by the kinetic analysis of CV measurements, which are used to distinguish between electrochemical reactions controlled by surface-controlled capacitive processes or those controlled by diffusion-controlled redox reactions. The relationship between the scan rate (v) and the peak current (i) can be expressed as: i = avb, where a and b are constants. The b value of 0.5 means the current response is diffusion-controlled, while the b value of 1.0 means a pseudocapacitive behaviour. Two b values close to 1.0 were calculated, thus indicating that the contribution of the pseudocapacitive behaviour is predominant in the FeS2@CNT electrode. This is the reason why FeS2@CNT electrodes exhibit excellent high rate performance. In addition, the pseudocapacitance contribution can be quantified by dividing the current (i) at a fixed potential into two components, the pseudocapacitance contribution (k1v) and the diffusion-controlled contribution (k2v1/2), as listed in the equation: i(V) = k1v + k2v1/2. The capacitive contribution of FeS2@CNTs was up to 91.1% at a sweep speed of 1 mV s−1. Lian and co-workers constructed a FeS2@B-CNT composite with bifunctional carbon nanotubes including CNT internal conductive networks and external protective cages through a one-step solvothermal method.99 FeS2 microparticles were anchored on the internal carbon nanotube conductive network by chemical bonding, thereby inhibiting the shuttle effect effectively. In addition, the CNT mesh cages formed on the surface of the FeS2 microparticles could better accommodate the volume expansion during cycling. This well-designed structure demonstrated excellent lithium storage capability, with an initial discharge capacity of 811 mA h g−1 and a corresponding ICE of 91.3% at 1000 mA g−1. Liu et al. confined pyrite in nitrogen-doped CNTs to obtain an FeS2/N-CNT composite, which were fabricated by floating catalyst chemical vapor deposition (FCCVD), followed by sulfidation, and used it as an anode of LIBs.155 Due to the presence of doped nitrogen, a large number of defects are generated on the N-CNT walls, making the transformation of iron wrapped inside the tube cavities easy. There were two forms of FeS2 in this composite, one was FeS2 nanowires confined in half-open N-CNTs and the other was FeS2 nanoparticles attached to the outer walls of the N-CNTs as a result of diffusion out of the inner tubes. The in situ generated FeS2 had strong adhesion to CNTs, which could improve the electron transfer ability and effectively suppress the shuttle effect of FeS2.
4.1.1.3. Fe3S4. 
Greigite (Fe3S4) is an important semi-metallic magnetic material, similar to Fe3O4, with a theoretical capacity of 725 mA h g−1, however, few applications of the compound have been studied as anode materials. Mai's group demonstrated for the first time that Fe3S4 particles were promising anode materials for SIBs.80 Due to the special conversion reaction, the octahedral Fe3S4 particles with the particle size of 100–200 nm decomposed into quantum-sized FeSx composed of FeS, FeS2 and Fe3S4 quantum dots (Fig. 9a–d), which provided synergistic effects and high reversibility, thereby resulting in an excellent electrochemical performance. The remarkable long-term cycle stability (275 mA h g−1 after 3500 cycles at 20 A g−1) and excellent rate capability (233 mA h g−1 at 40 A g−1) assured its great potential for practical utilization. Guo et al. encapsulated Fe3S4 nanoparticles in an rGO matrix using a hydrothermal method to obtain an Fe3S4 NPs@rGO composite.86 As an LIB anode, Fe3S4 NPs@rGO was endowed with high lithium storage capability with a high reversible capacity of 950 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at 100 mA g−1 due to the synergistic effect of Fe3S4 NPs and rGO. Hou et al. prepared hierarchical mulberry-like iron-cobalt sulfide nanoparticles by etching the FeCoAl alloy under mild conditions and then sulfurization.128 The obtained Fe3S4/Co9S8 nanoparticles were composed of interconnected tiny particles and numerous pore channels as the building subunits. Combined with the synergistic effect of the hierarchical structure and dual sulfides, it exhibited decent lithium storage performance. The rate performance from 100 to 2000 mA g−1 demonstrated low capacity decay. What's more, when the current returned to 100 mA g−1, it was restored to 923 mA h g−1.

4.1.1.4. Fe7S8. 
Fe7S8, a pyrrhotite with mixed valence and intrinsic metal properties, has a theoretical capacity of 663 mA h g−1 and a combined conversion mechanism (Fe7S8 + 16Li+/Na+ + 16e− → 7Fe + 8Li2S/Na2S).101 Liu et al. synthesized a self-buffered Fe7S8 structure composing of large and thin nanosheets (S-Fe7S8) via a simple hydrothermal method.63 The large space between nanoplates allowed them to freely expand and contract without initiation of fractures. As a result, the layer-by-layer structure was well maintained and did not exhibit any obvious volume changes as a whole during sodiation and desodiation processes. Resultantly, it showed excellent cycle stability and high rate capability due to its good kinetics and structural stability. The ICE was as high as 95%, and it maintained a high specific capacity of 300 mA h g−1 even at an ultra-high rate of 40C (Fig. 9e). What's more, it illustrated a super-long cycle stability at 5 A g−1, which was stabilized at 380 mA h g−1 even after 3500 cycles. The ex situ XRD technique was used to study the sodium storage mechanism for S-Fe7S8. It revealed that the sodiation and desodiation process was reversible with NaFeS2 as an intermediate (Fig. 9f).
Yao and co-workers prepared 1D Fe7S8@C nanorods by a hydrothermal method and studied the effect of surface carbon coating on the lithium storage performance.64 The results revealed that the carbon coating obtained by high-temperature carbonization significantly improved the conductivity of Fe7S8 and effectively promoted the ion transport efficiency. In addition, the 1D nanostructure of the Fe7S8@C nanorods had higher breaking strength than other structures and could better buffer the volume expansion in electrochemical reactions, showing extremely high CE and long cycle life. Even after 1000 cycles at a high current density of 2 A g−1, the discharge and charge capacity of 433.31 and 433.01 mA h g−1 could still be maintained. Yang et al. and Zhang et al. synthesized Fe7S8@C composite materials with different morphologies by the solvothermal method and a simple calcination method, respectively.107,120 Similarly, both composites exhibited improved electrochemical properties due to the synergy of Fe7S8 nanoparticles and the carbon layer. Fe7S8@C obtained by the calcination method prevented the agglomeration of Fe7S8 nanoparticles effectively. Benefiting from the nanosized particles, in situ generated carbon and the porous structure of the materials, the Fe7S8@C composite showed great electrochemical performance in both LIBs and SIBs. When used in LIBs, the specific capacity was as high as 1042 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at 100 mA g−1. Moreover, compared with the previous Fe7S8-based studies, the Fe7S8@C composite showed more improved rate performance. Zhu et al. proposed a facile method to prepare poly(dopamine) coated Fe2O3 nanobiscuits, and finally obtained an Fe7S8@C nanobiscuit composite through a thermal sulfurization process.68 As an anode for SIBs, Fe7S8@C nanobiscuits exhibited extremely outstanding electrochemical performance. Specifically, it delivered a first discharge/charge capacity of 759/716.3 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1, corresponding to an ICE of 94.31%. Besides, Fe7S8@C nanobiscuits delivered stable discharge capacities of 606.7 mA h g−1 and 530.8 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1 and 5 A g−1 after 1000 cycles. In order to maximize the reversibility and cyclability of the electrochemical conversion reaction, Jiang and co-workers designed a dual-carbon-confined structure to constrain Fe7S8 nanoparticles.101 In the Fe7S8/C/rGO composite, Fe7S8 nanoparticles were confined by both rGO and in situ formed amorphous carbon. The high conductivity of dual-carbon shells ensured the rapid transfer of electrons and lithium ions, which allowed Fe7S8/C/rGO to exhibit excellent rate performance and long cycle stability (294 mA h g−1 after 2000 cyles at 5 A g−1).
Song's group designed a nano–micro hybrid porous structure by the hydrothermal method coupled with a carbonization process.85 Its unique nano–micro hybrid porous structure was formed by Fe7S8 nanoparticles embedded in nitrogen-doped carbon porous spheres. Its hierarchical carbon skeleton was constructed from interconnected 2D nanowalls, and provided sufficient buffer space for the volume expansion during cycling. The well-bonded nitrogen atom provided more active sites and enhanced the interaction with lithium/sodium ions, thereby further improving its electrochemical performance. When used as the anode of LIBs, Fe7S8@NC-PS exhibited a high rate capability retaining a specific capacity of 440 mA h g−1 even at 20 A g−1. In addition, it delivered a stable reversible capacity of 630 mA h−1 after 200 cycles at 2 A g−1 (Fig. 9g) and an ultralong cycling stability with a reversible capacity of 438 mA h g−1 after 700 cycles at 10 A g−1. Wen et al. anchored Fe7S8 nanoparticles on nitrogen-doped graphene nanosheets which demonstrated excellent sodium storage capacity.114 The excellent sodium storage performance of FS-NGNs-80 was closely related to the high conductivity of nitrogen-doped graphene nanosheets. The charge transfer resistance (Rct) of FS-NGNs-80 was 50.9 Ω, far less than 140 Ω of Fe7S8. Even after 200 cycles, the Rct of the composite was still very competitive. At the same time, the SAED pattern also demonstrated a series of diffraction rings correlating with (311), (220), and (101) planes of FeS, together with (102) and (100) planes of metallic Fe, which was beneficial for improving the conductivity of the overall electrode. Pang et al. used bamboo leaves as raw materials to synthesize a ternary porous Fe7S8/SiOx/nitrogen-doped carbon composite by the hydrothermal method.83 The introduction of SiO2 and nitrogen ensured the growth of Fe7S8 nanowires, enhanced structural stability, and improved electrical conductivity. Therefore, the composite demonstrated good lithium storage performance.
Using a simple three-step synthesis strategy, Jiang and colleagues prepared, in a controlled manner, N-doped carbon-encapsulated Fe7S8 nanoclusters (Fe7S8@NC) with a core–shell structure. DFT calculations were used to verify the advantages of nitrogen doping in Fe7S8@NC nanocomposites. The interaction between Fe7S8 and carbon was investigated. Fig. 10a shows the optimized structures. The binding energies of the original carbon layer, graphitic N, pyridinic N and pyrrolic N with Fe7S8 are calculated to be −0.91, −1.49, −3.10, and −2.45 eV, respectively. This indicates that the doping of N improves the overall binding ability of Fe7S8 on the carbon layer. In addition, the electron-rich N-doped carbon increases the electrical conductivity and facilitates electron transfer during lithium or sodium storage (Fig. 10b).191

Liu's group successfully encapsulated Fe7S8 in N-doped hollow carbon fibers (NHCFs/Fe7S8) by chemical bath deposition and subsequent sulfidation treatment, with a capacity of 517 mA h g−1 for 1000 cycles at a current density of 2 A g−1, and a reversible capacity of 444 mA h g−1 at a high current density of 20 A g−1, with better electrochemical performance than FeS2. In order to gain insight into the above experimental results, the Gibbs free energy change (ΔG) of the reaction of Fe7S8 and FeS2 with Na ions was simulated to predict the reversibility of the electrochemical reaction. The results show that Fe7S8 has a more neutral ΔG value (−1.33 eV for Fe7S8 and −3.01 eV for FeS2) (Fig. 10c). Therefore, Fe7S8 possesses a higher reversibility for sodiation/desodiation than FeS2. The higher reversibility of the reaction with sodium ions ensures that the Fe7S8 electrode material has a better reversible capacity. At the same time, the NHCFs/Fe7S8 electrode has a high Na+ diffusion coefficient and powder electron conductivity (Fig. 10d).192
4.1.1.5 Fe1−xS. 
Apart from these types of iron sulfides mentioned above, Fe1−xS is also a popular electrode material which has attracted great attention. Xiao et al. designed and prepared a novel anode comprising Fe1−xS nanoparticles and bamboo-like CNTs through an effective in situ chemical transformation.168 The as-prepared Fe1−xS@CNTs with a 3D network not only offered high conductivity paths and channels for electrons and ions but also provided the combined merits of iron sulfide and CNTs, resulting in improved performance as an anode material in SIBs. Song et al. used a two-step in situ chemical conversion method to prepare hierarchical iron sulfide nanocubes (Fe1−xS@C/rGO) consisting of multiple iron sulfide–carbon core–shell nanoparticles coated with few-layer graphene.115 The Fe1−xS@C/rGO composite provided much improved rate performance as an anode for SIBs with a high specific capacity of 323 mA h g−1 at 10 A g−1. The good sodium ion storage performance was attributed to its stable hierarchical building structures and the high graphitization degree of carbon obtained during the transformation process, which promoted the accessibility of sodium ions and improved the mechanical durability. Liu et al. prepared a ternary Fe1−xS@PCNWs/rGO composite composed of hierarchical Fe1−xS-filled porous carbon nanowires/rGO through a facile assembly and sulfuration strategy.88 The obtained hybrid Fe1−xS@PCNWs/rGO paper exhibited superior flexibility and good mechanical properties as shown in Fig. 11a. The top-view and the inserted cross-section-view of FESEM images showed that the hybrid paper was a layered structure with numerous 1D PCNWs and 2D rGO NSs closely tangled with each other (Fig. 11b). The TEM image in Fig. 11c shows that Fe1−xS NPs were in situ formed and encapsulated by PCNWs, which were tightly adhered to the rGO NSs. The composite possessed several advantages, including rendering an efficient electron/ion transport network, buffering the volume expansion of Fe1−xS nanoparticles, mitigating the dissolution of polysulfides, and enabling superior kinetics toward efficient sodium storage. Therefore, the Fe1−xS@PCNWs/rGO composite revealed high flexibility and structural stability, and further exhibited remarkable sodium storage performance with reversible capacities of 573–89 mA h g−1 with areal mass loadings of 0.9–11.2 mg cm−2 over 100 cycles at 0.1 A g−1 (Fig. 11d).

Liu et al. reported a facile method for the synthesis of the Fe1−xS/NSC composite using a nanosized iron-based MOF as the precursor.129 Due to the introduction of the carbon matrix co-doped with sulfur and nitrogen, it exhibited superior lithium storage performance than Fe1−xS. This improved electrochemical performance could be attributed to the unique structure, nano crystallization, and integration of Fe1−xS and N,S co-doped carbon. It can maintain a high specific capacity of 1135 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1 after 100 cycles in LIBs (Fig. 11e). Even at a high rate of 5 A g−1, Fe1−xS/NSC could still maintain a high reversible specific capacity of 586 mA h g−1. Chen et al. used MIL-88A-Fe as the precursor to prepare a rod-like r-Fe-N-Fe1−xS@C composite containing iron–nitrogen–carbon species through simultaneous sulfidation and nitridation in one step.96 Among them, the low-valence Fe–N–C species served as a polysulfide adsorbent and electrocatalyst to promote the conversion reaction during cycling. Such elaborately designed nanostructures showed excellent performance in the application of anodes for LIBs (950 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at 1 A g−1). Using FeCl3 as the iron source, and NH4F and NH4H2PO4 as additives, Yang et al. prepared core–shell heterostructure hollow spheres (Fe1−xS@SC HSs) as an SIB anode material.55 Fe1−xS/SC heterojunctions played a key role in alleviating the large volume variation and stabilizing the reaction products, thus improving the conversion reaction kinetics of Fe0 and Na2S, and resulting in a highly reversible conversion reaction. As an anode of SIBs, it showed a highly reversible capacity of 365 mA h g−1 at 10 A g−1. Besides, a reversible capacity of 454.3 mA h g−1 could still be retained after 500 cycles at 1.0 A g−1. In situ XRD was further conducted to explore the reaction mechanism of Fe1−xS@SC HSs upon the first sodiation/desodiation process (Fig. 11f). It suggested a reversible sodium storage process including intercalation and conversion stages with NayFe1−xS as the intermediate material.
Kim et al. successfully prepared an Fe1−xS/MnS composite via hydrothermal and sulfidation reactions.56 Due to the presence of two metal sulfides with different crystal structures, Fe1−xS/MnS could better accommodate the volumetric strain during cycling. Compared with the original Fe1−xS and MnS electrode, Fe1−xS/MnS exhibited much improved rate performance and cycling stability. Liu et al. synthesized Fe3O4/Fe1−xS nanoparticles using a simple and scalable strategy, which was further coated with carbon nanosheets and modified with MoS2.82 MoS2 provided a large interface contact area between the active material and the electrolyte, which accelerated charge transfer and provided higher capacity. Due to the synergistic effect of Fe3O4/Fe1−xS nanoparticles, carbon nanosheets and MoS2, the Fe3O4/Fe1−xS@C@MoS2 composite exhibited excellent electrochemical performance. In terms of cycle stability, Fe3O4/Fe1−xS@C@MoS2 exhibited high specific capacities of 1003 mA h g−1 and 504 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at 200 mA g−1 in LIBs and SIBs, respectively.
4.1.1.6. Hybrid FexSy. 
Some researchers have compounded iron sulfides with different morphologies and crystal structures into one system, producing more remarkable anode materials. For example, Shao et al. used a facile cold quenching-gas phase sulfidation technology to prepare a hybridized 3D network configuration, in which FeS2/FeS hetero-nanoparticles were confined by interconnected monodispersed graphene nanosheets (MGNs) with FeS2/FeS as the main active material (FeS2/FeS@MGN).174 The composite exhibited excellent rate performance and cycle reversibility. It can be seen that the curves almost overlapped after the second cycle from the charge–discharge curves, indicating the good reversibility of the FeS2/FeS@MGN composite. Its excellent electrochemical performance was attributed to the apparently wrinkled surface features, which helped to avoid the π–π restack between the graphene nanosheets, and meanwhile form a penetrative electrode framework with rich multi-scale pores. Guo et al. applied a simple in situ hydrothermal reaction to combine FeS2 microspheres and Fe3S4 microspheres with rGO to prepare an iron sulfides@rGO composite.65 Benefitting from the different morphologies and crystal structures of FeS2 and Fe3S4, this composite could better alleviate the volume expansion owing to the steric hindrance effect during cycling, hence improving the lithium storage performance.


4.1.2. Iron selenides. 
In recent years, transition metal selenides with high capacities have been extensively studied in LIBs and SIBs. Among them, iron selenides, such as FeSe, FeSe2, Fe3Se4, and Fe7Se8, have shown great potential in the field of energy storage owing to their high theoretical capacities and the same energy storage mechanism as iron sulfides.79,84,122,193 Similar to iron sulfides, iron selenides also suffer from serious volume expansion during cycling. Therefore, those strategies as mentioned above that can improve the electrochemical performance of iron sulfides, such as nanotechnology and recombination with conductive materials, have also been widely used in iron selenides.160
4.1.2.1. FeSe. 
As a typical layered compound, FeSe (a = b = 3.73 Å, and c = 5.77 Å, space group P4m2) possesses a simple crystal structure. Theoretically, Li+/Na+ could be easily intercalated between the FeSe4-tetrahedra layers. According to first-principles calculations of density functional theory (DFT), Na+ has a diffusion barrier as low as 0.46 eV in the FeSe4-tetrahedral layer.79 Zhou et al. successfully synthesized a microflowers-like FeSe@CNS composite based on a carbon-confined oriented-attachment mechanism through a simple in situ pyrolysis method, which was constructed by 2D core/shell FeSe/carbon nanosheets.121 After further annealing, an FeSe@CNS-anneal composite with better performance was obtained. The unique structure of this composite with high crystallinity could effectively enhance the sodium ion diffusion kinetics, accelerate electron transfer, and suppress the volume expansion of the FeSe core. When used as the anode for SIBs, it provided an initial discharge specific capacity of 461.3 mA h g−1, corresponding to an ultra-high ICE of 99.8%. In addition, FeSe@CNS-anneal showed superior rate performance with retaining a high specific capacity of 343.8 mA h g−1 at 5 A g−1 (Fig. 12a). Meanwhile, the FeSe@CNS-anneal composite could provide a reversible discharge capacity of 283 mA h g−1 after 200 cycles at 5 A g−1. The strong pseudocapacitance behavior involved and the calculated high diffusion coefficient (according to the theoretical formula: DNa+ = 4(mBVM/MBS)2(ΔES/ΔEτ)2/πτ, where mB is the sample mass, MB is the molar mass, VM is the molar volume, S is the electrode surface area, and ΔES and ΔEτ values can be obtained from the galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) curve) confirmed the high sodium-ion storage kinetics of FeSe@CNS-anneal (Fig. 12b). Using sulfonated polystyrene microspheres and sulfonated poly (divinylbenzene) nanotubes as both the template and carbon source, Zheng et al. prepared carbon@FeSe nanocomposites with uniform hollow microspheres (S-C@FeSe) and nanotube structures (T-C@FeSe), respectively (Fig. 12c and d).159 The BET surface area analysis revealed that both T-C@FeSe and S-C@FeSe had large surface area, however, the surface area of T-C@FeSe was slightly higher. The hollow interior of the nanotubes and microspheres, the pores of carbon and the interstices between FeSe nanoparticles contributed to their large surface area together. The voltage profiles of S-C@FeSe and T-C@FeSe in the potential region of 0.01–3 V for the first three cycles are shown in Fig. 12e. It shows that T-C@FeSe delivered higher specific capacities than S-C@FeSe, which was attributed to the more active sites for Li-ion reaction originating from its higher surface area. However, the large surface area of T-C@FeSe caused serious electrolyte decomposition and the excess formation of SEI layer, thus leading to slightly lower ICE than S-C@FeSe. Yang et al. reported a sustainable seaweed-template strategy to prepare a 3D FeSe-CNFA network.79 The composite was composed of ultrafine FeSe nanoparticles embedded in a 3D net-like CNF aerogel. Due to the strong interaction between FeSe nanocrystals and the carbon layer, the intercalation kinetics of Na+ was enhanced. Resultantly, it showed an ultra-high rate capability with a discharge capacity of 180 mA h g−1 even at a high current density of 20 A g−1. Li et al. used a simple one-step solid-phase method to prepare FeSe/N–C composites with FeSe nanoparticles embedded in N-doped carbon.125 The nitrogen doping not only accelerated the transmission of sodium ions and electrons, but also shielded the tightly incorporated FeSe nanoparticles against agglomeration and peeling off during cycling. The unique structure provided high conductivity and structural stability, while providing good charge transport kinetics. As a result, FeSe/N–C showed extremely stable reversible capacity in the long cycle test. Even after 800 cycles, the discharge capacity of 333.9 mA h g−1 was still maintained.

4.1.2.2. FeSe2. 
In the orthorhombic FeSe2 crystal structure, the Fe atoms are complexed with six Se atoms in octahedral coordination, while the Se atoms are bonded to the surrounding three Fe atoms and one Se atom in tetrahedral coordination. Because of the low spin d6 configuration of Fe2+, Se is removed from the lattice during the insertion of Li+/Na+, causing disruptions of bond and compromising the complexation of Fe atoms. Such a change allows the FeSe2 material to have a certain degree of electronic conductivity and thus exhibit excellent electrochemical properties. Chen's group used a simple hydrothermal method to prepare nanooctahedra-assembled FeSe2 microspheres.84 This composite was evaluated as an anode of SIBs and exhibited quite stable cycling stability and excellent rate performance because of the pseudocapacitive behavior during the charge and discharge processes. Even at a high rate of 25 A g−1, a stable discharge capacity of 226 mA h g−1 could still be obtained. Tang et al. proposed delicately synthesized cellular carbon-wrapped FeSe2 nanocavities (h-FeSe2@PC) with sub-5 nm ultrathin walls and multiple rooms for ultrafast sodium storage (Fig. 13a and b).122 Unlike the traditional interphase Kirkendall effect, selenized metastable Fe3C nanoparticles on cellular carbon underwent an exotic stress-induced cracking–hollowing reassembly process, and finally formed an h-FeSe2@PC composite composed of ultrathin walls and multiple nanocavities. Its unique structure provided a way for the near-limit accessible ion diffusion length in FeSe2 and fast electron transfer ensured by the cellular carbon, which ensured the rapid transfer of ions, thus exhibiting an extremely low-decay rate capability and ultrastable cyclability. The h-FeSe2@PC anode exhibited well-sustained discharge platforms at 1.65, 0.98, and 0.64 V and charge platforms at 1.50 and 2.01 V at different current densities, which demonstrated a highly stable voltage output capability. Moreover, h-FeSe2@PC displayed superior rate capability with the discharge capacities decreased slightly from 414.5 to 384.3 mA h g−1 as the current rates increased from 0.5 to 20 A g−1, corresponding to a low capacity loss of 9.5%. Resultantly, Fig. 13c revealed an almost horizontal Ragone plot of h-FeSe2@PC at different current rates from 0.5 to 20 A g−1, indicating an extremely low decay of energy density with the power density increasing. Specifically, it delivered a high energy density of 670.7 W h kg−1 and power density of 35.54 kW kg−1 at 20 A g−1.

Kang' group prepared hollow H-FeSe2/GC composite microspheres using a simple and scalable spray pyrolysis and post-treatment method.71 The microsphere was composed of many interconnected cavities and a closed surface with uniform hollow FeSe2 nanoparticles embedded. This unique structure provided a large number of conductive channels to promote the efficiency of ion and electron transport. In addition, the synergy between the internal cavity of FeSe2 and the excellent mechanical strength of the carbon matrix greatly buffered the volume expansion caused by the insertion and extraction of sodium ions. Therefore, H-FeSe2/GC showed improved electrochemical performance as an anode of SIBs. Fan et al. prepared 3D hierarchical hollow nanocubes constructed from 1D FeSe2@C core–shell nanorods using a thermal-induced selenization of Prussian blue microcube precursor (Fig. 13d).135 Benefitting from its high conductivity and unique structural features, FeSe2@C nanorods provided good charge transport kinetics by facilitating the charge transfer into the inner of FeSe2 nanorods. When used as an anode material of SIBs, the FeSe2@C composite exhibited excellent rate performance and ultra-stable long-term cycling stability at a high current density of 10 A g−1 (Fig. 13e). Zhou et al. fixed FeSe2 nanoparticles uniformly on the surface of graphene nanosheets (GNS) through the selenization reaction of iron oxide.160 By controlling the selenization process, the effect of different surface oxide contents on the sodium storage capacity of FeSe2 was studied, and it was found that the surface oxide had an inhibitory effect on the activity of FeSe2 by its ability to be converted into a sodiated oxide shell with high mechanical strength and poor conductivity, thereby increasing the phase transfer resistance, inhibiting the insertion and extraction of sodium ions, and hence resulting in poor sodium ion storage dynamics. When the composite was selenized at 400 °C for 12 h, FeSe2 nanorods with much less surface oxide were generated on the GNSs, which was assigned as FeSe2/GNS-400. As expected, FeSe2/GNS-400 had an extremely low Rct, resulting in much improved rate performance.
Ji et al. prepared a rod-like FeSe2 coated with nitrogen-doped carbon through the anisotropic self-assembly properties of iron selenide by the thermal reaction between Prussian blue and selenium.146 FeSe2/N–C demonstrated impressive electrochemical performance as an anode for SIBs. It showed that the sodiation/desodiation curves of 8000th–8010th at 10 A g−1 had a consistent charge and discharge trend, revealing a very stable and reversible phase transformation. Meanwhile, the discharge/charge process could be completed within 236 s, indicating its excellent rate performance. Correspondingly, FeSe2/N–C maintained a high reversible capacity of 308 mA h g−1 even after 10000 ultra-long cycles at a high current density of 10 A g−1. The analysis of kinetic properties revealed that the reduced particle size enhanced the contribution of pseudocapacitance and improved the ion transmission efficiency. The CV curves after the 500th cycle and the corresponding TEM, HRTEM and SAED images were evaluated to illustrate the sodium storage mechanism and reversibility of FeSe2/N–C during the cycling process. The CV curves after 500 cycles were a little different from the first several cycles, which were attributed to the active process (Fig. 13f). However, the SAED images of the discharge products at 3.0, 1.3, 0.8 and 0.5 V after 500 cycles still showed the conversion process from FeSe2 to FeSe and Na2Se to Fe and Na2Se, confirming the stability of the phase evolution process (Fig. 13g–i).
4.1.2.3. Fe3Se4 and Fe7Se8. 
Fe3Se4 possesses a NiAs-type structure with Fe vacancies arranged in an ordered fashion, such a structure can provide more efficient active sites for Na+ ion storage. Meanwhile, the monoclinic unit cell of Fe3Se4 (a = 6.167 Å, b = 3.537 Å, c = 11.17 Å, and β = 92.0°) is able to effectively store multiple types of metal ions (such as Li+, Na+ and K+).194 The difference is that Fe7Se8 has a laminated hexagonal structure with a P3121 space group,124 which also favors the insertion of alkali metal ions. Li et al. prepared Fe3Se4/C composites on a large scale through a simple solid-phase reaction.167 The composite was a porous structure and composed of aligned carbon coated nanorods. The introduction of coated carbon improved the electrical conductivity and structural stability during cycling. When used as an anode of LIBs, it showed good cycle performance and structural stability. After 100 cycles at a current density of 1 A g−1, the capacity retention rate was as high as 98.3%. Liu et al. synthesized Fe7Se8@C composed of carbon-coated Fe7Se8 nanoparticles through a one-step selenization strategy.107 The carbon framework prevented the agglomeration of Fe7Se8 nanoparticles effectively, and also provided high specific surface area and high porosity, which greatly improved the ion transport efficiency. Therefore, Fe7Se8@C showed great rate performance as an anode of SIBs. When the current density increased from 0.2 to 2 A g−1, there was only low capacity loss. In addition, the discharge/charge curves of the Fe7Se8@C electrode almost coincide with each other in the following loops after the multistep conversion reaction of the initial cycle, demonstrating good cycling stability. Chen et al. proposed a novel stress-release strategy to insert MoSe2 nanosheets into the surface of the yolk–shell structure Fe7Se8@C composite (Fe7Se8@C@MoSe2).58 Benefiting from this unique dual-buffer structure, the Fe7Se8@C@MoSe2 composite could further accommodate sodiation-induced fracture in the carbon layer from a mechanical standpoint. It maintained a stable capacity of 423.7 mA h g−1 after 100 charge and discharge cycles at 100 mA g−1. Even after 600 cycles at a current density of 1 A g−1, the capacity retention rate was still as high as 87.1% (Fig. 14a). Besides, Fe7Se8@C@MoSe2 exhibited attractive rate capability with a high reversible capacity of 274.5 mA h g−1 remaining at 5.0 A g−1. The high surface capacitive contribution provided reasonable evidence for the fundamental origin of the highest rate performance of Fe7Se8@C@MoSe2 among these three samples (Fig. 14b).

Using Prussian blue as a precursor, Wan et al. prepared an Fe7Se8@NC composite via a simple thermal method.124 Fe7Se8 nanoparticles were uniformly wrapped in a nitrogen-doped graphitized carbon layer to form a core–shell structure, which effectively improved the electrical conductivity. The characterization analysis including ex situ XRD, SAED and CV revealed that the activation process is closely related to the structural evolution during cycling, which affected the sodium storage mechanisms of Fe7Se8 and effectively improved the electrochemical performance by reducing the particle size. Correspondingly, the specific capacities of Fe7Se8@NC first decreased to 285 mA h g−1 and then slowly increased to 340 mA h g−1 within the initial 200 cycles and finally remained at this value until 1200 cycles at 1000 mA g−1. Sun et al. used a simple etching method combined with the selenization strategy to prepare uniform yolk–shell Fe7Se8@C/N nanoboxes, in which Fe7Se8 nanoparticles were completely embedded in a thin carbon shell (Fig. 14c).157 This unique structure greatly improved the overall conductivity and structural stability of the composite as well as effectively buffered the volume changes caused by sodiation and desodiation. Resultantly, it exhibited excellent rate performance with a high specific capacity of 316 mA h g−1 even at a large rate of 5 A g−1. Meanwhile, the long cycle performance test also showed excellent performance with almost no capacity decay after 1000 charge and discharge cycles at 1 A g−1. The full cell performance of the yolk–shell Fe7Se8@C/N nanostructure was also evaluated by combining the NASICON-type Na3V2(PO4)2O2F (NVPOF) as the cathode. The full cell also delivered excellent cycling stability with a high capacity retention of 98% after 100 cycles (Fig. 14d).


4.1.3. Iron tellurides. 
Iron chalcogenide compounds, including iron sulfides and iron selenides, display attractive performances, and a large number of related studies have been devoted to them because of their excellent long-term cycle stability and rate performance. Compared to the above two types of iron chalcogenides, iron telluride attracted much less attention in the application of LIBs and SIBs. However, the heavy FeTe2 with a high volume density (8.06 g cm−3) will also be a promising electrode material owing to the smaller volume changes during cycling.195–197 Cho et al. studied iron telluride as the anode material of SIBs for the first time. They successfully prepared an FeTe2–rGO composite by a combination strategy of spray pyrolysis and subsequent tellurization.73 The sodium storage mechanism of FeTe2–rGO composites in SIBs was studied by using CV, galvanostatic charge and discharge, and ex situ XRD analysis (Fig. 14e–g), which was proposed as: FeTe2 + 4Na+ + 4e− ↔ Fe + 2Na2Te. During the charge and discharge processes, FeTe2 underwent a conversion reaction to produce metallic iron nanocrystals and Na2Te reversibly. Due to the addition of rGO, FeTe2–rGO exhibited high structural stability and electrical conductivity, thus delivering a reasonable sodium storage performance. The discharge capacities of the FeTe2–rGO hybrid powders for the first and 80th cycles were 493 and 293 mA h g−1, respectively. After 80 cycles, the overall morphology remained unchanged with most FeTe2 nanoparticles still coated with rGO. In addition, it exhibited a high discharge capacity of 257 mA h g−1 even at a large current density of 3 A g−1. Lin's group used DFT to calculate the adsorption and diffusion characteristics of FeTe2 for sodium ions, and evaluated its potential as an anode of SIBs.198 The study found that FeTe2 possessed strong sodium adsorption properties and excellent diffusion kinetics. In addition, the reasonable theoretical capacity and open circuit voltage of FeTe2 offered broad application prospects as an anode material of SIBs.


4.1.4. Other iron-chalcogenide-based compounds and composites. 
Although compounding with carbon materials is an effective and practical method to improve the electrochemical performance of iron-chalcogenide-based composites, the problem of volume expansion still exists, and meanwhile, the cycle performance still needs to be improved. In recent years, researchers have studied single-phase or multi-phase multi-component iron-based sulfides and selenides, such as solid solutions. Benefiting from the diversified crystal structures and the synergetic effect of different metal ions on energy storage mechanisms and volume changes, these kinds of iron-based multi-component chalcogenides revealed more unique and promising properties when applied as electrode materials in LIBs and SIBs.173
Kang's group prepared a multicomponent solid solution powder (Fe0.5Ni0.5)9S8 with a single phase and Zn–Fe–S powder with mixed phases, and a 1:2 Zn/Fe molar ratio by spray pyrolysis and one-step sulfidation method, respectively.70,140 The as-prepared (Fe0.5Ni0.5)9S8 and Zn–Fe–S powders both had unique yolk–shell structures and the synergistic effect of multi-component composition, showing improved electrochemical performance. The discharge capacities of the (Fe0.5Ni0.5)9S8 composite in SIBs for the 2nd and 100th cycle were 530 and 527 mA h g−1, respectively, corresponding to a high capacity retention of 99% measured from the 2nd cycle. In addition, when the current density increased from 0.1 A g−1 to 5 A g−1, the reversible discharge capacity was slightly reduced from 568 mA h g−1 to 465 mA h g−1. Zn–Fe–S powder was composed of mixed sphalerite (Zn,Fe)S and hexagonal FeS crystal structures, and showed a high lithium storage capacity of 913 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles at a current density of 500 mA g−1. Hou et al. proposed a method for preparing nanostructured binary transition metal selenides.126 Compared with single metal chalcogenide composites, the excellent intrinsic conductivity of various metals and richer redox reactions significantly enhanced their electrochemistry performance. To prove the universality of the concept, they prepared a series of binary transition metal selenides, of which iron-nickel selenide (FNSe) and iron-cobalt selenide both were used in SIB anodes and showed considerable electrochemical performance. Moreover, in situ XRD (Fig. 15a) clearly indicated the phase change of the FNSe electrode during the sodiation/desodiation process. As expected, during the discharge from 2.5 to 1.4 V, the peak associated with the (103) plane of Fe2NiSe4 showed a tendency to decay and transformed gradually into Na2Se upon discharge to 0.5 V. When charging from 0.5 to 3 V, the peak associated with the (103) plane and the shoulder peaks ascribed to (112) and (202) planes of Fe2NiSe4 reappeared along with the disappearance of Na2Se peaks. Based on in situ XRD data, the reaction mechanism was proposed to be: Fe2NiSe4 + 8Na+ + 8e− ↔ 2Fe + Ni + 4Na2Se. Due to the synergy between iron and nickel, FNSe exhibited a remarkable cycle stability. Specifically, FNSe delivered a discharge capacity of 755 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at a current density of 1 A g−1. Even after 2600 long cycles, it still delivered a high capacity of 553.2 mA h g−1 at 4 A g−1.

Wang et al. reported a simple and quick synthetic route to prepare pure CuFeS2 quantum dots (QDs)@C composites with the unique structure of CuFeS2 QDs encapsulated in a carbon frame.173 Similar to the nano-confinement effect of MOF, the carbon framework hindered the growth of CuFeS2 crystals, which resulted in the formation of CuFeS2 QDs with a size of 5–10 nm. Benefiting from the high conductivity of the carbon framework, short electron and ion diffusion path and the ability to buffer large volume expansion, it showed excellent lithium storage performance. Resultantly, the CuFeS2 QD composite could maintain a high specific capacity of 760 mA h g−1 at 500 mA g−1 after 700 cycles. Yang's group designed and prepared a high-rate, long-cycle stability anode material, which was composed of uniform hollow iron sulfide polyhedra with cobalt doping and graphene wrapping (CoFeS@rGO).158 Graphene and the coated hollow polyhedron structure ensured the rapid transmission of ions and excellent structural stability. The hollow polyhedron structure and structural evolution of CoFeS@rGO during sodiation and desodiation processes were clearly explored by in situ TEM measurement (Fig. 15b). As can be seen, the cavity size continuously decreased upon sodiation and increased upon desodiation obviously without any structure collapse, which illustrated that the hollow structure could well release the mechanical stress and buffer the volume expansion effectively. In addition, the doping of Co reduced the diffusion energy barrier of Na+, which further promoted the charge transfer kinetics and electrochemical activity. Therefore, CoFeS@rGO showed excellent electrochemical performance in SIBs, especially in terms of long-term cycle stability. Specifically, CoFeS@rGO had a capacity retention rate of 84.8% after 1500 charge and discharge cycles at 1000 mA g−1 (Fig. 15c). Even at a high current density of 5 A g−1, CoFeS@rGO still maintained a high specific capacity of 449.4 mA h g−1. Wang et al. studied a hierarchical hollow spherical structure of FeS2/ZnS coated with sulfur-doped carbon.119 Due to the synergistic effect between sulfur atoms doped in the carbon shell and two metal sulfides with different lithium storage potentials, Fe–Zn–S@S-doped-C composite showed improved reversible capacity and long-term cycle stability as an anode of LIBs. Tong et al. synthesized an Fe2Zn3S5/Fe1−xS@C composite with heterostructures using Fe-MOF-5 as a template.59 The in situ XRD and the initial charge and discharge curves of Fe2Zn3S5/Fe1−xS@C were applied to explore the intrinsic reaction mechanisms. The results revealed that the lithium storage process of the composite was divided into six stages, which included three reduction processes to Fe&Li2S, Zn&Li2S and LiZn&SEI upon sodiation, respectively, and three oxidation processes to Zn, ZnS and Fe1−xS upon desodiation, respectively (Fig. 15d). The carbon cage coated bimetallic sulfide composite with an average pore width of 9.06 nm exhibited a self-buffering effect in the cycling process, which effectively prevented the dissolution of polysulfide intermediate products. After 700 charge and discharge cycles, the composite showed a reversible specific capacity of 2071.2 mA h g−1 at a current density of 500 mA g−1. The improved electrochemical performance of Fe2Zn3S5/Fe1−xS@C was attributed to the high conductivity of the carbon cage, and the inhibition of the growth of Fe2Zn3S5/Fe1−xS and the dissolution of polysulfide intermediates. What's more, the iron–zinc composite with a heterostructure caused additional redox reactions and further relieved the volume expansion stress, thus promoting the improvement of the electrochemical performance of Fe2Zn3S5/Fe1−xS@C. Furthermore, Yan et al. synthesized 2D homogeneous NbS2 nanosheets co-doped with Fe and Se through a simple oil phase synthesis process.127 By adjusting the amount of Fe and Se to control the morphology of the composite, the optimized design of Fe0.3Nb0.7S1.6Se0.4 nanosheets, with a thickness of about 5 nm and lateral sizes of 1–2 μm, showed quite excellent electrochemical performance. Especially at a current density of 5 A g−1, Fe0.3Nb0.7S1.6Se0.4 still maintained a lithium storage capacity of 444 mA h g−1 even after 3000 charge–discharge cycles (Fig. 15e).

4.2. Other energy storage devices
In recent years, iron-chalcogenide-based electrode materials have not only attracted much scientific interest in the field of LIBs and SIBs, but also in other energy storage devices such as KIBs, Li–S batteries and SCs, showing excellent electrochemical performance and potential practical application value,199–203 as can be seen in Table 3.

4.2.1. KIBs. 
KIBs received great attention due to the natural abundance and low cost of potassium in large-scale energy storage systems (the reserves of lithium, sodium, and potassium in the earth's crust are 0.0017 wt%, 2.3 wt% and 2.07 wt%, respectively). In particular, the comparably low standard redox potential of potassium (Li+/Li: −3.04 V, Na+/Na: −2.71 V, K+/K: −2.93 V vs. SHE), which is higher than that of lithium but lower than that of sodium, makes KIBs promisingly cost-effective battery systems with high voltage and high specific energy density.203–206 In addition, potassium ions have much weaker Lewes acidity than other alkalis, which provides them a smaller Stokes' radius of solvated ions, hence resulting in high ion conductivity.207 Moreover, the ability to use aluminum foil as the current collector further makes KIBs suitable for practical applications. However, the ionic radius of K+ (0.138 nm) is much larger than that of Na+ (0.102 nm) and Li+ (0.076 nm), which causes large volume changes and the resulting poor cycling performance. Currently, the main challenge for KIBs in its infancy is to design and prepare suitable active materials to host the large potassium ions and accommodate the large volume changes during charge and discharge processes. As a momentous family of alkali-ion active materials, iron-chalcogenide-based materials have also been considered as promising electrode materials of KIBs because of their high theoretical capacities benefiting from the conversion reactions.205–208 The acceptable potassium ion storage mechanism for iron-chalcogenide-based materials corresponds to the following equations.
Discharge process: FeQ2 + xK+ + xe− → KxFeQ2 (0 < x < 2)(4.1) KxFeQ2 + (2 − x)K+ + (2 − x)e− → FeQ + K2Q(4.2) FeQ + 2K+ + 2e− → Fe + K2Q(4.3)

Liu et al. prepared a composite composed of carbon-coated FeSe2 nanoparticles anchored on thin carbon nanosheets (FeSe2/NC) via a simple in situ chemical transformation method and applied it as an anode material for KIBs.207 Benefiting from the nanosized FeSe2 particles to reduce the ion and electron diffusion paths, the protective carbon layer to buffer volume changes, and the carbon nanosheets matrix to enhance the electron transport and structural stability, the FeSe2/NC composite demonstrated improved cycle performance and rate capability. Specifically, the FeSe2/NC electrode delivered high specific capacities of 434 mA h g−1 after 70 cycles at 0.1 A g−1, and 301 mA h g−1 after 250 cycles at 1.0 A g−1. The potassium storage mechanism was investigated by CVs, discharge/charge curves, ex situ XRD and TEM techniques (Fig. 16a–d). During the first discharge, three successive reactions, FeSe2 → KxFeSe2 → FeSe + K2Se → Fe + K2Se occurred. Upon the first charge, FeSe2 did not form again, and the final charge product was KxFeSe2. In the following cycles, the reversible reaction proceeded between KxFeSe2 and Fe. Li et al. successfully synthesized the S-doped carbon-coated rod-like FeS2/C@C composite through simple hydrothermal and sulfidation methods.205 The rod-like FeS2/C@C hybrid composite was evaluated as an electrode material for KIBs and showed good rate performance (175 mA h g−1 at 0.5 A g−1) and cycle stability with a specific capacity of 262 mA h g−1 retained after 100 cycles at 0.1 A g−1. The enhanced potassium storage performance was attributed to the multiple functions of carbon coating, which could effectively alleviate the volume expansion during the cycles, maintain the structural integrity, and improve electrical conductivity.

4.2.2. Li–S batteries. 
Li–S batteries are considered as one of the most important systems for the next generation energy storage devices because of their high theoretical energy density and the apparent merits of sulfur such as low cost, natural abundance and environmental friendliness, which make Li–S batteries more commercially competitive than LIBs.209 However, the insulating nature of sulfur, Li2S2 and Li2S, the shuttle effect caused by the dissolution of the long-chain lithium polysulfides as well as the substantial volume expansion occurring (up to 80%) upon discharge lead to low utilization of active materials, fast self-discharge, poor CE, and short cycle life, thus greatly hindering the practical applications of Li–S batteries. Great efforts have been devoted to designing appropriate sulfur hosts to solve the above issues.199 Carbon was regarded as one of the most potential hosting materials owing to its high conductivity and good physical barrier effect. However, the weak physical interaction between nonpolar carbon and polar polysulfides is not sufficient to inhibit polysulfide dissolution, which makes carbon–sulfur composite cathodes usually suffer from rapid capacity decay.210 Recently, various polar compounds, such as metal oxides and metal sulfides have been investigated as sulfur host materials owing to their strong polarity and catalyzing capability towards polysulfides. Among them, iron-chalcogenide-based materials are garnering researchers' interests and have been employed as sulfur hosting materials to improve the electrochemical performance of Li–S batteries because they were proven to have the ability to strengthen the combination with polysulfides and boost the polysulfide redox reaction kinetics.
Yuan et al. synthesized a flower-like carbon assembly composite with FeS decorated (FeS/C) by a simple hydrothermal method and applied it as the sulfur hosting material.209 Benefiting from the strong chemical interactions between FeS and sulfur/polysulfides, polysulfide dissolution was depressed upon discharge and charge processes, enhancing the sulfur utilization. In addition, FeS played the key role of the electrocatalytic active site in promoting the conversions of intermediate polysulfides during electrochemical reactions, thus resulting in improved rate performance. As can been seen, the platforms of FeS/C–S voltage profiles are longer and clearer than C–S cathode materials at various current densities (Fig. 16e). Moreover, the much lower voltage difference values (ΔE = 0.16, 0.21 and 0.28 V) of discharge and charge platforms in FeS/C–S profiles than those of C–S (ΔE = 0.24, 0.29 and 0.47 V) illustrated a lower polarization. Therefore, FeS/C revealed an improved rate and cycling performance compared to the flower-like porous carbon in Li–S batteries. It showed an initial discharge specific capacity up to 870 mA h g−1 at 0.1C. After 100 cycles, the capacity retention remained at about 66.2%. Li et al. constructed a hollow architecture composed of ZnS–FeS heterostructures encapsulated in N-doped carbon and studied the effect of metal sulfide heterojunctions on the kinetics of the redox reaction of polysulfide.210 Kinetic analyses and theoretical calculation illustrated that the abundant hetero-interfaces of the n-type ZnS semiconductor and p-type FeS semiconductor effectively facilitate electron and lithium ion migration and promote the reversible conversion of polysulfides to solid Li2S. Moreover, the strong chemical adsorption between polysulfides and polar FeS–ZnS greatly suppressed the diffusion of polysulfides into the electrolyte. Benefiting from the heterostructure, the S@ZnS–FeS@NC electrode exhibited excellent rate capacity and cycling stability. As shown in Fig. 16f, S@ZnS–FeS/NC showed discharge specific capacities of around 1278, 1083, 911, 858 and 718 mA h g−1 at 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 and 4.0C, respectively. In addition, it maintained long cycle stability with a low capacity decay of 0.16% per cycle within 200 cycles at 0.2C.


4.2.3. Supercapacitors (SCs). 
Compared to battery energy storage systems, SCs are a relatively different type of energy storage system with high power densities, superior rate performance, ultra-long cycling life and environmental friendliness, which makes them the best choice for hybrid electric vehicles and short-term power-type devices.200 However, the low energy density of SCs has limited their practical application. According to the energy storage mechanism, SCs can be classified into two categories: electrochemical double-layer capacitors (EDLCs) and pseudocapacitors. EDLCs mainly use carbonaceous materials as electrodes, which store electrical energy by the adsorption of ions in the electrolyte onto the surface of electrode materials. The pseudocapacitance mechanism of SCs is based on the reversible Faraday reactions on the surface of the electrode materials to store electric energy.211 Therefore, pseudocapacitors usually have much higher energy densities than EDLCs, which facilitate more effort to be devoted to the pseudocapacitor field. The electrode material is one of the most important components of the SCs that affect the specific energy density directly. Hence, designing and developing appropriate materials with high specific capacitance is still challenging. Recently, transition metal chalcogenides aroused considerable attention owing to their higher ionic diffusivity and conductivity than the corresponding oxides.212,213 Among these transition metal chalcogenides, iron-chalcogenide-based materials are attractive electrode materials for SCs because of their lower band gap, electrochemical activity, and abundant resources.
Durga et al. reported the synthesis of FeS2/PVP on Ni foam through a facile chemical bath deposition method.212 The as-prepared FeS2/PVP/NF composite was tested as an electrode for supercapacitors, showing a high specific capacitance of 526.08 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and high cycle stability with slight capacity decay of only 8.8% after 3000 cycles (Fig. 17a). The improved electrochemical properties of the FeS2/PVP/NF composite were attributed to its high surface area, enhanced electroactive sites, and the fast electron/ion transport. Sun et al. prepared FeS2 nanoparticles anchored on graphene nanosheets (FeS2/GNS) using a simple and rapid microwave-assisted hydrothermal method.214 The galvanostatic charge and discharge curves of FeS2/GNS exhibited representative voltage plateaus at −0.68 and −0.92 V (vs. Hg/HgO) at different current densities from 3 A g−1 to 30 A g−1 (Fig. 17b). Compared to the pure FeS2 and GNS electrodes, FeS2/GNS showed longer discharging time, implying the highest specific capacity. Benefiting from the pseudocapacitive behavior and small particle size of FeS2 and the large surface area, excellent electrical conductivity and mechanical performance of GNS, the as-prepared FeS2/GNS composite revealed a high specific capacity of 721 F g−1 at a low current density of 3 A g−1 and a superb rate capability of 459 F g−1 at a high current density of 30 A g−1 (Fig. 17c). In addition, it showed excellent cycling stability with a capacity retention of 88% after 5000 cycles at 20 A g−1. When tested as an anode material for all solid-state hybrid SCs with Ni(OH)2@Co9S8 core–shell materials as the cathode, it exhibited an impressive specific energy of 95.8 W h kg−1 at an average power density of 949 W kg−1 owing to the high specific capacity and wide potential of the FeS2/GNS anode (Fig. 17d). Karade et al. reported the synthesis of FeS thin film electrodes through a scalable and successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction method at room temperature and applied it in a symmetric flexible solid-state supercapacitor as the electrode material with PVA-LiClO4 as the gel electrolyte.215 The formed flexible device showed a high operational window of 0 to 2 V. Within this voltage window, the FeS-based supercapacitor delivered a maximum specific and volumetric capacitance of 4.62 F g−1 and 65.17 mF cm−3 at 0.75 mA, respectively, along with a high specific energy of 2.56 W h kg−1. Besides, the symmetric device demonstrated good cycling stability with a high capacity retention of 91% after 1000 cycles. In addition, this flexible device showed high practical value in bendable portable electronics. It revealed no change in the CV curves by retaining a cycling performance of 100% even at a bending angle of 175.

5. Conclusions and future prospects
In this review, we have systematically discussed the typical synthesis methods of iron-chalcogenide-based materials. Compared to selenium and tellurium, sulfur is more abundant in the earth and lower in cost, which, combined with the low price of iron, makes the cost of iron sulfides more advantageous (the prices of iron ore and sulfur per ton are approximately $130 and $330, respectively). In addition, iron sulfides can be obtained by a simple heat treatment using iron and sulfur sources. Thus, iron-based sulfides have been widely studied due to their advantages over the other two iron-based materials (iron selenides and iron tellurides) in terms of production costs and large-scale application. Importantly, we present the energy storage mechanism and overview the current status of their application in energy storage devices, which include LIBs, SIBs, KIBs, Li–S batteries and SCs, as can be seen in Table 3. The iron-chalcogenide-based materials are able to meet the energy and power demands for a variety of applications ranging from small devices to electrical vehicles and exhibit a breakthrough improvement for future energy storage devices.
5.1. Drawbacks and countermeasures of iron-chalcogenide-based materials
The high demand for clean and renewable energy has facilitated the exploration of advanced energy storage systems with high energy density, long cycle life and low cost. For iron-chalcogenide-based materials, large volume changes and relatively low electron conductivity during electrochemical cycling processes remain a serious problem, which lead to serious capacity fading and inferior rate capabilities. In addition, the severe polarization of iron-chalcogenide-based electrodes during the charge/discharge process leads to hysteresis of the charging/discharging profiles, which, together with the low ICE, results in the energy loss. The electrochemical properties of iron-chalcogenide-based materials can be improved by engineering nanostructures with different dimensions and sizes, compounding with carbonaceous or other conductive materials, generating pores and void spaces, doping with heteroatoms and increasing the compatibility of the electrolyte. Benefiting from the diverse nanostructures, morphologies and components, the as-obtained iron-chalcogenide-based materials have high specific surface area, short electron/ion transport path and the ability to buffer huge volume changes, hence delivering great rate capability and long cycle life.
5.2. Challenges for iron-chalcogenide-based materials
One of the main challenges for developing high-performance energy storage devices is the design and preparation of suitable electrode materials. Recent research progress has demonstrated that the iron-chalcogenide-based materials show practical potential as a new generation of advanced electrode materials with low-cost, non-toxic nature and high theoretical capacities. In virtue of these merits, various kinds of iron-chalcogenide-based materials with tunable compositions, morphologies and structures have been prepared by using well-modified synthetic methods and they exhibited enhanced electrochemical performance when evaluated as electrode materials in different energy storage devices such as LIBs, SIBs and SCs. In general, the synthetic processes for the iron-chalcogenide-based materials are relatively simple, controllable and scalable. Although significant advances in the preparation of iron-chalcogenide-based materials and their electrochemical performances have been achieved, great challenges still exist in their real applications. (1) The enhanced rate capability and cycle life by nanostructure engineering are achieved at the expense of tap density. Nanostructured electrode materials intrinsically suffer from low volumetric energy density because of their high specific surface area and large interparticle space. Besides, the large surface area also leads to side reactions and excess formation of the SEI layer, which significantly lower the ICE which is of great importance for practical application. Developing well-designed nano–micro hybrid structures for iron-chalcogenide-based materials could be an efficient way to increase the volumetric energy density and ICE while maintaining high gravimetric energy density, high power density and long cycle life. (2) The energy storage mechanisms for iron-chalcogenide-based materials are still unclear. The exploration of electrochemical reaction mechanisms upon charging and discharging are the foundations for developing advanced electrode materials, which can provide a theoretical guidance for designing and preparing suitable iron-chalcogenide-based electrode materials for LIBs, SIBs, KIBs and SCs, and hosting or catalytic materials for Li–S batteries efficiently. In order to better understand their energy storage mechanism, advanced characterization technologies (in situ XRD/TEM/XPS/AFM, XAS, etc.) and theoretical calculations are strongly recommended to conduct systematic investigation on the phase transformation process, electron transfer process, SEI formation process, interface process, pseudocapacitance process, the related catalytic process, and possible synergetic process. (3) The current reported synthesis methods for iron-chalcogenide-based materials still remain in the laboratorial stage, which is still a long way from commercialization. Developing a facile, low-cost, controllable and eco-friendly synthetic process is an essential way to realize industrial production for iron-chalcogenide-based materials.
The previous experiences and the remaining challenges point out the direction for further research on the development of suitable iron-chalcogenide-based materials in different energy storage devices. It is compulsory to accept and overcome the above-mentioned challenges comprehensively before realizing the final commercialization of iron-chalcogenide-based materials in one or more energy storage devices. We expect this review will provide a novel and useful insight into the approaches needed to surmount the issues and challenges facing iron-chalcogenide-based materials in various energy storage systems. With unremitting research effort regarding this research topic, we believe there are great opportunities to realize real applications for iron-chalcogenide-based materials in one or more energy storage devices in the near future.
