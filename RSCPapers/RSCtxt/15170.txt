    , Accepted 16th January 2015First published on 21st January 2015AbstractLithium-ion batteries are considered as one of the most promising power sources for energy storage system for a wide variety of applications such as electric vehicles (EVs) or hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs). The anode material often plays an important role in the determination of the safety and cycling life of lithium-ion batteries. Among all anode materials, spinel Li4Ti5O12 has been considered as one the most promising anode candidates for the next-generation large-scale power lithium-ion batteries used for HEVs or EVs because it has a high potential of around 1.55 V (vs. Li/Li+) during charge and discharge, excellent cycle life due to the negligible volume change, and high thermal stability and safety.

1. Introduction
With the rapid development of the economy, more environmental issues are caused by conventional energy such as fossil fuels, coal and oil. Renewable energies such as solar energy have attracted much attention, but most of them are not widely used due to the changeable weather. Therefore, many researchers are concentrating on electro-chemical energy storage. Attempts have been made to improve the energy density and cycle life. Among those, lithium-ion batteries have been considered as the most important candidate due to their high voltage and specific capacity.1,2 The research on lithium-ion batteries began in the middle of the 20th century when it was noticed that lithium metal was very stable in a number of nonaqueous electrolytes, such as fused salts, liquid SO2, or organic electrolytes.3 Since lithium-ion batteries were first introduced into the market by Sony in 1991, the rechargeable lithium-ion battery has been used for commercial applications, such as power supply for electric vehicles and energy storage.4–6 However, current lithium-ion batteries still do not overcome the detrimental drawback of low power density, short cycle life and safety issues when used in EVs, HEVs and other energy storage applications.7 The electrochemical performance of lithium-ion batteries is mainly determined by the electrodes including the anode and cathode. Therefore, the search for both is of great importance. Up to now, the commercialized materials used as cathodes and anodes for lithium-ion batteries are LiCoO2 and carbonaceous anodes, respectively. In recent years, most of the efforts have been focused on synthesizing materials such as layered LiMn1/3Co1/3Ni1/3O2, spinel LiMn2O4, and olivine-type LiFePO4 as alternatives to the previous LiCoO2.8–15
As for the anode, graphite was the first thing used to replace Li-metal in lithium-ion batteries. The maximum theoretical specific charge of LiC6 is 372 mA h g−1. Commercial graphite has a high energy density, low potential and long cycle life,16 but its reversible capacity is low, and the electrodes can be polarized by highly reactive lithium metal plates onto the surface of the negative electrode when combined with the cathode.17 Since 1990, much research has been done to develop new and high capacity anode materials.18 Non-graphitized carbon materials, including silicon and Sn-based anodes, have been studied widely.19–21 Liang et al.19 pointed out that the Si-based materials have the highest theoretical capacity (3590 mA h g−1) among all the investigated anodes. In addition, Si anodes show a moderate working potential of 0.5 V vs. Li/Li+.20 However, the large number of lithium-ion insertions/extractions leads to a huge volume change, which results in structural pulverization and electrical disconnection between the active materials and the current collector, and finally fast capacity fading.21 The theoretical capacity of tin (Sn) is 994 mA h g−1 and the theoretical capacity of the oxide of tin (SnO2) is 782 mA h g−1.22 Hence, the specific capacity of tin oxide and tin is over twice that of the graphite anode (372 mA h g−1). However, large volume changes also occur in the charge–discharge process of tin oxide and tin.23–25
Today, it is almost universally recognized that titanate is a promising candidate due to its high voltage and compatibility with electrolytes.26 The “zero-strain material” of Li4Ti5O12 (LTO) attracts the most attention due to its high voltage platform, no volume change and perfect cycling performance.27–29 As reported in previous references, the solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) that can be formed during the initial intercalation of lithium at about 0.8 V on the graphite surface tends to decompose at temperatures as low as 60 °C.30–32 This reveals that the thermal stability of the SEI plays an important role in the safety of lithium-ion batteries. Li4Ti5O12-based materials are an alternative class of materials to graphite that operate at a potential above 1.55 V vs. Li/Li+, which avoids the reduction of the electrolyte on the electrode surface and the formation of the SEI layer. Hence, it can be concluded that Li4Ti5O12-based anode materials can offer a significant safety advantage over the graphite anode, and can be used to develop extremely safe power lithium-ion batteries for HEV or EV applications. Hence, considering the safety of lithium-ion batteries supplying HEV or EV, more enterprising manufacturers are considering developing batteries by combining the Li4Ti5O12 anode with another cathode. Various possible candidates have been reported, as shown in Fig. 1, such as 1.55 V Li4Ti5O12/LiNi0.8Co0.15Al0.05O2 (LNCAO),33 2.4 V Li4Ti5O12/LiCoO2 (LCO),34–36 2.3 V Li4Ti5O12/Li1+x(Ni1/3Co1/3Mn1/3)1−xO2 (L333),37 1.9 V Li4Ti5O12/LiFePO4 (LFP),38–41 2.45 V Li4Ti5O12/LiFe0.2Mn0.8PO4 (LFMP),42 2.6 V Li4Ti5O12/LiMn2O4 (LMO),43–46 3.2 V Li4Ti5O12/LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 (LNMO)47–51 and Li4Ti5O12/LiCoPO4 (LCP),52 and 3.5 V Li4Ti5O12/LiCoMnO4 (LCMP).53

Unfortunately, some kinetic problems with low electrical conductivity (ca. 10−13 S cm−1) and lithium diffusion coefficient (ca. 10−9 to 10−16 cm2 s−1) limit its full capacity at high charge–discharge rates.54–57 Many researchers are attempting to improve the rate performance of Li4Ti5O12, including improvement of the electron transfer between the active material and the current collector,7 preparation of nano-Li4Ti5O12 particles, doping with cations and surface coating. Hence, this review mainly focuses on the recent advancements in the synthesis and characterization of Li4Ti5O12, as well as the effects of doping and surface coating on the electrochemical performance.
2. Structure and electrochemical performance
Li4Ti5O12, a white non-conductive crystal, can be stable in air. It has a spinel structure with a cubic space group Fdm, as illustrated in Fig. 2.58
 Fig. 2  Structure of Li4Ti5O12, Li7Ti5O12 and Li9Ti5O12. Reproduced from ref. 58 with permission from Elsevier. 
In Li4Ti5O12, all the tetrahedral 8a sites are occupied by lithium and the octahedral 16d sites are shared by lithium and titanium with an atomic ratio of 1:5 in the cubic oxygen array. Li4Ti5O12 can be denoted as [Li3]8a[Ti5Li]16d[O12]32e. In the intercalation, three lithium atoms at the 8a sites move to the empty 16c sites and the new lithium atoms also take up the 16c sites. Thus, it converts to a rock salt structure Li7Ti5O12 ([Li6]16c[Ti5Li]16d[O12]32e). It is amazing that the occupation of these sites by lithium-ions does not change the structure of Li4Ti5O12. Our group have found that the formation enthalpies (ΔfHm) of Li4Ti5O12, Li7Ti5O12 and Li8.5Ti5O12 are determined to be −6061.45 ± 4, −6558.58.45 ± 4 and −6490.78 ± 4 kJ mol−1, respectively. The difference between Li7Ti5O12 and Li8.5Ti5O12 is quite small.59 According to these values, the thermodynamic stability of Li4Ti5O12 can be enhanced after the intercalation of 3Li+, but the thermodynamic stability can be diminished as more Li+ is inserted. Still, both Li7Ti5O12 and Li8.5Ti5O12 have higher thermodynamic stability than Li4Ti5O12.59 We also confirm the existence of strong covalent bonds between Ti and O in Li4Ti5O12 (see Fig. 3 (ref. 60)). Hence, the strong covalent bonds are favorable for the structural stability of Li4Ti5O12 during cycling.60

The variation of the lattice parameter is shown in Fig. 4.61 The lattice parameter decreases with the insertion of lithium and restores after lithium extraction. According to the calculation, the whole volume change is less than 0.1% during cycling in the voltage range from 0 to 2 V.61

To investigate the electrochemical performance of Li4Ti5O12, the initial charge–discharge curve in a potential range from 0 V to 2 V and the cyclic voltammogram are shown in Fig. 5.62 The curve presents a flat plateau near 1.55 V, which indicates a two-phase reaction, as the Li4Ti5O12 converts to Li7Ti5O12. In the process, Li4Ti5O12 has a theoretical capacity of 175 mA h g−1. However, it only results in a less than 0.2% change in the cell volume as the lattice parameter varies from 8.3595 Å to 8.3538 Å. Moreover, it can be seen that more than three lithium-ions can be inserted per formula, as the 8a, 8b and 48f sites can be occupied since the 16c sites are fully occupied. Thus, Li4Ti5O12 can be further denoted as Li9Ti5O12 corresponding to the capacity below 1.0 V.60,63

In Fig. 5, the slope around 0.7 V is related to the formation of a SEI film composed of organic lithium alkylcarbonates.64 In commercial lithium-ion batteries, a protective SEI film has to be formed to suppress the further decomposition of the electrolyte solution and to protect the common carbon anode. The formation mechanisms and the properties of SEI films on a carbon anode are of vital importance due to their influence on the electrochemical and safety performance of lithium-ion battery.65–68 The mechanisms involved in the formation are affected by the applied voltage, current, temperature and the solvent used.69–71
It has been reported that an SEI film cannot be formed on the surface of Li4Ti5O12 cycled above 1 V as the electrolyte solution can only be reduced below 1 V. However, he demonstrated that an SEI film can also be formed when cycled at 1–3 V.72 To describe the passivating layer, Shu32 observed the Li4Ti5O12/electrolyte interface by HRTEM (shown in Fig. 6).
 Fig. 6  HRTEM image of Li4Ti5O12 as first charged to 0.0 V.32 Reproduced from ref. 32 with permission from The Electrochemical Society. 
The surface appears to be a uniform passivation layer when the low cutoff potential was set to 0.0 V. It is about 9 nm, thicker than that on carbon materials. After being charged to 4.5 V, the SEI film decomposed partially and became uneven. It has been demonstrated that components of SEI film appearing in the oxidation process are different from those formed below 1.0 V. Inorganic fluorides and copolymers are the final products for electrolyte oxidation, while organic lithium alkylcarbonates are the primary components formed during the reduction.32 As shown in Fig. 5a, the initial discharge capacity of Li4Ti5O12 is higher than the theoretical capacity of about 298 mA h g−1. Zhong et al.73 reported that the theoretical capacity of the Li4Ti5O12 anode is about 260 mA h g−1 when working in the range from Li4Ti5O12 to Li8.5Ti5O12. The first-principles calculations show that further insertion of lithium into Li8.5Ti5O12 is not allowed, because the predicted intercalation potential turns negative, which results in the formation of a metallic layer on the surface of the Li8.5Ti5O12. It is generally recognized that the theoretical capacity of carbon black is about 186 mA h g−1. The 10% carbon black in the electrode can supply a capacity of about 20 mA h g−1. Moreover, the large capacity loss may be caused by an irreversible reaction at the surface, such as the formation of an SEI film.74
3. Synthesis of Li4Ti5O12 anode material
As we know, the electrochemical performance of electrode material is greatly affected by synthesis methods and conditions. Among the various methods used to synthesize Li4Ti5O12 powders, the most popular are solid-state reactions and wet chemical (solution synthetic) methods with different morphologies and sizes. The main synthesis methods for Li4Ti5O12 are summarized as follows. The synthesis methods, precursors, synthesis conditions, and merits/shortcomings for each method as well as the electrochemical performance are listed in Table 1.
Table 1 Synthesis methods, precursors, synthesis conditions, and merits/shortcomings for each method as well as the electrochemical performance of Li4Ti5O12

Electrochemical performance




Solid-state reaction
Li2CO3 and TiO2 are mixed as precursors evenly, then heat-treated at high temperature (600–1000 °C) in air for 10–20 h
It has a potential commercial application due to the simple synthesis route and low synthesis cost
They often suffer from a series of problems, such as inhomogeneity, irregular morphology, uncontrollable particle growth and agglomeration
The kinetic performance and capacity contribution of Li4Ti5O12, especially at high charge–discharge rates, is poor


Microwave processing
Li2CO3 and TiO2 are mixed and ball-milled as precursors. Then the precursors are heated in a microwave system
Microwave heating can ensure higher penetration depth and low synthesis temperature
This process has higher synthesis costs
Li4Ti5O12 has a high rate capacity and excellent reversibility during high charge and discharge rates


Molten-salt synthesis
TiO2, LiOH·H2O, LiCl and KCl were mixed and ground. The mixed powders were calcined at 800 °C for 8 h in air, and then naturally cooled to room temperature
As reaction media, molten salts can provide a liquid reaction environment, and then accelerate the formation reaction of Li4Ti5O12 with high purity and narrow particle size distribution
It is difficult to find proper molten media. The high calcination temperature and energy consumption hinder its practical application
Li4Ti5O12 has a high initial discharge capacity and good rate performance


Sol–gel synthesis
Stoichiometric lithium salt and Ti source were dissolved in ethanol solution of organic acid to obtain a gel. The resulting gelatin was dried yield to obtain organic precursors. The gel precursors were preheated at 500–800 °C in air to obtain Li4Ti5O12 powders
This method offers Li4Ti5O12 products with a homogeneous distribution of uniform, sub-micron size particles with good stoichiometry control
The disadvantages are high synthetic cost, complexity of synthetic route, lower utilization of the reactor, and the generation of CO2 gas
Li4Ti5O12 synthesized by the sol–gel method often has a high discharge capacity and good cycling performance


Hydrothermal synthesis
Ti source and lithium salt were dispersed in organic solvent under magnetic stirring, and then some water was added under stirring to achieve a milky suspension, which was then transferred to a Teflon-lined autoclave for solvothermal treatment at 180–220 °C for 24–48 h
The advantages of hydrothermal synthesis are fast reaction kinetics, phase purity with narrow particle-size distributions, high crystallinity, homogeneous particle products, low temperature post-calcinations, and environmentally benign
The hydrothermal processes need expensive stainless-steel autoclaves and Teflon liners, expensive organic reagents used as raw materials, and subsequent complicated washing processes of the products, and limit the mass production
The electrochemical reversibility, lithium ion diffusion, and conductivity can be obviously improved. They often exhibit superior rate performance and high capacity even at high charge–discharge rates




3.1. Solid-state reaction
Solid-state reaction is the most common method to prepare electrode materials, whereby solid precursors are ground or ball-milled together, followed by heat-treatment of the resultant mixture in a furnace. The condition of solid-state synthesis is quite simple and easy to realize. Hence, solid-state synthesis is a good choice for the synthesis of many materials. Generally, Li2CO3 and TiO2 must be mixed evenly according to the stoichiometric ratio, and then the mixture is heat-treated at high temperature (600–1000 °C) in air. It must be pointed out that this method is energy-wasting and the products cannot reach the requirements, and they often suffer from a series of problems, such as inhomogeneity, irregular morphology, uncontrollable particle growth and agglomeration (i.e., large particle size), limiting the capacity contribution, especially at high charge–discharge rates.75–82 Although the above described solid-state reactions have disadvantages, from a commercial viewpoint, the solid-state synthesis of Li4Ti5O12 powders is a potential commercial application due to the simple synthesis route and low synthesis cost.
Han et al.83 synthesized Li4Ti5O12 by solid-state reaction using Li2CO3 and anatase TiO2 as the raw materials. TiO2 of two different sizes was added when the starting materials were milled. They found that the 0.30 mm beads resulted in finer Li4Ti5O12 with a higher capacity. The finer particles had a capacity of 174 mA h g−1 at a 0.1 C rate and the capacity retention reached 80% at a 10 C rate. Wang et al.84 reported a simple, environmentally friendly synthesis of submicron-sized Li4Ti5O12/Li2TiO3 using the solid state method, which showed an initial discharge capacity of 155 mA h g−1 at a 0.5 C rate, a specific capacity of 113 mA h g−1 at 10 C, and capacity retention of 98.2% at a 10 C rate after 500 cycles. Studying the influence of milling time on the solid-state synthesis, Michalska et al.85 found that the Li4Ti5O12 obtained after a longer ball milling time showed smaller grains, smaller crystallite sizes and better electrochemical performance.
3.2. Microwave processing
Microwaves have a high penetration depth and can be quickly absorbed by the reactants. Thus, microwaves prompt the nucleation of reactants, so as to shorten the crystallization time. In all, target products can be synthesized in a relatively short time with low synthesis temperatures by microwave heating.86–88 Qiao et al.89 reported that spinel Li4Ti5O12 was prepared by microwave-assisted solid-state method, and it had a high rate capacity and excellent reversibility with initial charge and discharge capacities of 166.9 and 167.4 mA h g−1 achieved at 1 C, and the capability retention was nearly 100% after 500 cycles. Kim et al.90 prepared Li4Ti5O12 nanoplatelet/reduced graphite by a two-step microwave-assisted solvothermal reaction and heat treatment, which exhibited a discharge capacity of 154 mA h g−1 at 1 C, 128 mA h g−1 at 50 C and 101 mA h g−1 at 100 C.
3.3. Molten-salt synthesis
The molten salt method is considered as one of the simplest techniques to prepare ceramic materials including multi-component oxides.91 Molten-salt synthesis usually adopts one or several salts with low melting points as the reaction medium, such as alkali chlorides, sulfates, carbonates, or hydroxides, thus it can provide a liquid reaction environment. In this way, the formation of crystals can be accelerated. A high purity product can be obtained at relatively lower temperatures because the diffusion rates between the reaction components are high in the molten media.
Bai et al.91 investigated the influence of composite LiCl–KCl molten salt on spinel Li4Ti5O12; the as-prepared sample had an initial discharge capacity of 169 mA h g−1 and an initial charge–discharge efficiency of 94% at 0.2 C, and achieved good rate performances in the range from 0.2 C to 5 C. Rahman et al.92 prepared a nanocrystalline Li4Ti5O12–TiO2 duplex by a simple molten-salt method using an eutectic mixture of LiOH–LiNO3–Li2O2 at 400–500 °C; the Li4Ti5O12 sample with heat-treating at 300 °C for 3 h showed the best electrochemical performance, as the initial discharge capacities achieved were 193 mA h g−1 at 0.2 C and 146 mA h g−1 at 1 C, with a capacity retention of 95% after 100 cycles at 1 C.
3.4. Sol–gel synthesis
The motivation for sol–gel processing primarily lies in the fact that it ensures potentially higher purity, lower processing temperatures and uniform morphology with a narrower particle size distribution than traditional ceramic powder methods.93 The sol–gel process is the conversion of a colloidal suspension (sol) into an integrated 3D network (gel) with pores of submicrometer dimensions and polymeric chains whose average length is greater than 1 μm. Hence, the sol–gel method has a series of advantages over the traditional solid-state reaction, such as homogeneously mixing the reactants at the atomic or molecular level, lower synthesis temperature, shorter heating time, smaller particle size on a nanometer scale and uniform particle distribution.94–99 So, the sol–gel method is a versatile tool for the synthesis of Li4Ti5O12 (ref. 100) Although the above described sol–gel method has advantages, the shortcomings are also obvious: (1) addition of organic compounds increases the costs, (2) the utilization of the reactor is lower due to the expansion of the gas, and (3) a large amount of CO2 gas comes out in the annealing. As a result, this method is quite unsuitable for industrial production due to the high synthetic cost and the complexity of the synthetic route.101
Zhang et al.102 synthesized Li4Ti5O12 by a modified and facile sol–gel method. They reported that the Li4Ti5O12 nanoparticle showed a network morphology with high dispersion, which reached a discharge capacity of 164 and 108 mA h g−1 at 1 C and 10 C rates, respectively. The results of the cycling performance showed a high capacity maintenance ratio of 97% at 1 C after 1000 cycles. Mosa et al.96 prepared film-shaped spinel Li4Ti5O12 electrodes on gold coated quartz by sol–gel, in which rutile-TiO2 was detected using grazing incidence X-ray analysis and micro-Raman as it has a lower content in comparison with lithium. Good galvanostatic cycling and very flat discharge–charge profiles confirmed the high purity of the Li4Ti5O12 electrodes obtained with the higher lithium content composition. Hao et al.103 reported a synthesis of Li4Ti5O12 with an average particle size of 200 nm by a novel sol–gel method using oxalic acid. The discharge capacity of Li4Ti5O12 (oxalic acid to titanium ratio R = 1.0) was 171 mA h g−1 in the first cycle and 150 mA h g−1 after 35 cycles with the optimal synthesis conditions at 800 °C for 20 h. The electrochemical reaction based on Ti4+/Ti3+ redox couple was a typical two-phase reaction with flat charge and discharge curves.103 Hao et al.104 further studied the influence of various complex agents on the electrochemical performance of Li4Ti5O12. Their study included citric acid (CA), acetic acid (AA), triethanolamine (TEA) and oxalic acid (OA), and the cycling performance of the prepared Li4Ti5O12 electrodes was investigated. They reported that all the samples have an approximately similar initial discharge capacity (about 170 mA h g−1). The Li4Ti5O12 electrodes prepared by OA and AA exhibited discharge capacities of 133 and 117 mA h g−1, while the samples prepared by TEA and CA delivered 150 and 137 mA h g−1, respectively, after 30 cycles.104
3.5. Hydrothermal synthesis
In the process of hydrothermal synthesis, the reactants undergo a physical chemistry reaction in water or organic solvent at 100–200 °C. Hydrothermal synthesis has many advantages such as fast reaction kinetics, phase purity with narrow particle-size distributions, high crystallinity, homogeneous particle products, low temperature post-calcinations, and environmentally benign. Hence, it is not only cost effective but can also be scaled up easily. In the product phase, the particle size and morphology of Li4Ti5O12 can be effectively controlled by adjusting the reaction parameters.105 It is very appealing due to its feasibility for industrial application.106 Furthermore, it proves to be an easily controllable approach to produce Li4Ti5O12 particles.107 Therefore, the hydrothermal method has been adopted in recent years to prepare nanostructured Li4Ti5O12.108–110 However, there are also a few disadvantages to hydrothermal processes, such as the need for expensive stainless-steel autoclaves and Teflon liners, possible safety issues during reaction processes, the impossibility of studying in situ reactions due to the closed systems, the expensive organic reagents used as raw materials, and subsequent complicated washing processes cause much trouble. In addition, the expensive and highly toxic organic reagents limit mass production.111 Moreover, the product is not pure as TiO2 and Li2TiO3 appear.112
To prepare Li4Ti5O12 hollow microspheres, a hydrothermal route has been adopted by Tang et al.113 The micrographs clearly demonstrate the evolution of the structure from solid microspheres to hollow microspheres and finally separated nanosheets. They have demonstrated that the materials exhibited a superior rate performance and high capacity even at a high rate as they maintained a large discharge capacity of 131 mA h g−1 at 50 C. Tang et al.114 adopted a hydrothermal process to synthesize flower-like spinel Li4Ti5O12 as shown in Fig. 7a, and the nanostructured Li4Ti5O12 showed a high reversible capacity and the rate capability reached 165.8 mA h g−1 at 8 C rate. Later, Chen et al.115 reported the synthesis of sawtooth-like Li4Ti5O12 nanosheets by a hydrothermal process: they presented exceptionally high rate performance and excellent cycling stability with an intriguing and unique morphology, as shown in Fig. 7b, and obtained 132 mA h g−1 after 200 cycles at 10000 mA g−1 (57 C). Li and coworkers116 reported that the synthesis of a dual-phase Li4Ti5O12–TiO2 nanocomposite (see Fig. 7c) by a hydrothermal method, and the average grain size of the as-prepared Li4Ti5O12 samples is 20–30 nm with and without thiourea added; the electrochemical performance was improved compared with individual single phase Li4Ti5O12 and anatase TiO2 samples: the nanocomposite can still maintain a large discharge capacity of 116 mA h g−1 after 300 cycles at 1 C, and it also obtained a large discharge capacity of 132 mA h g−1 at a current density of 1600 mA g−1 upon cycling. To improve the rate-capability of Li4Ti5O12, Liu et al.117 prepared dual-phase Li4Ti5O12–TiO2 nanocrystallines via a hydrothermal method: the materials measured around 15–20 nm in size and had abundant phase interfaces. Electrochemical measurements demonstrated that the dual-phase Li4Ti5O12–TiO2 exhibited good electrochemical performance at high current rates, and the initial discharge capacities of the nanocrystallines are 241 and 202 mA h g−1 at discharge rates of 0.2 and 5 C, respectively. Moreover, the capacity was 140 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles at 20 C. Wang et al.118 also synthesized a dual-phase composite by a solvothermal route; the Li4Ti5O12–TiO2 composite exhibited a spherical particle shape with a particle size of ca. 200–300 nm, much smaller than that of Li4Ti5O12; it showed a higher reversible capacity and better rate performance compared with single phase Li4Ti5O12 as it maintained a reversible capacity of 140 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at 5 C.

4. Design of nanostructured Li4Ti5O12
As we know, the specific surface area, surface energy, and surface chemistry play a very important role during charge–discharge. The smaller dimensions of nanomaterials may also offer a large electrode/electrolyte contact area and short path lengths for Li+ and electronic transport, leading to high charge–discharge rates, as well as suppressing the strain of lithium insertion/extraction, improving the recharge ability of the batteries.119 Hence, nanomaterials are highly attractive for lithium-ion batteries because they can offer a range of unique advantages over their traditional counterparts. Although the above described nanomaterials have many advantages, there are still some objective shortcomings. It is difficult to control the dimensions of the electrode material during the synthesis. The large electrolyte/electrode surface area often leads to significant side reactions with the electrolyte. In normal conditions, nanomaterials have a smaller tap density than micrometer-sized particles, which reduces the volumetric energy density.120
As a lithium intercalation material, a large surface area and a short lithium diffusion distance are also critical to increasing the rate performance of Li4Ti5O12.121 In particular, nanostructured Li4Ti5O12 with various morphologies, such as nanowires,122,123 nanosheets,124 nanoparticles,125 nanotubes,126 nanorods127 and microspheres,128 has been successfully prepared and the materials exhibit superior high rate capabilities and great cycling stabilities. Li et al.122 prepared one-dimensional nanostructured Li4Ti5O12, including nanotubes and nanowires, by a low temperature hydrothermal lithium ion exchange process. The images of these materials are shown in Fig. 8. The as prepared spinel Li4Ti5O12 nanowires maintained an initial discharge capacity of about 165 mA h g−1 at 0.3 C, and retained a discharge of 120 mA h g−1 at 1 C.

Nanosheets or nanoplates are special nano-structured particulate morphologies in which one dimension is in the nanometer range (<100 nm) and the other two dimensions are in the micrometer or sub-micrometer range.121,129 Xiao et al.124 reported the facile synthesis of Li4Ti5O12 nanosheets stacked by ultrathin nanoflakes. The nanoflakes are interconnected with a thickness of only about 3 nm. The Li4Ti5O12 nanosheets delivered an initial discharge capacity of 175.9 mA h g−1, together with a discharge capacity of 166.8 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at 0.5 C. Even at 20 C, the discharge capacity could reach up to 100.2 mA h g−1. These indicated that the kinetics of lithium ion and electron diffusion were promoted through offering more transporting channels. Lee et al.125 reported homogenous Li4Ti5O12 nanoparticles prepared as given in Fig. 9. These nanoparticles had an average grain size of about 30–40 nm with excellent phase purity. The XRD pattern showed that no other phases such as Li2O, Li2O2, LiOH or Li2Ti3O7 appeared.

Li4Ti5O12 nanotubes are also attracting great attention. The Li4Ti5O12 nanotubes were synthesized using annealing and an alkali-hydrothermal reaction through a simple structural rearrangement.126 The materials had uniform open-ended tubular structures with outer and inner diameters of ∼11 nm and ∼6 nm, respectively, as plotted in Fig. 10. The Li4Ti5O12 nanotubes could store up to 0.7 wt% H2 at ambient temperature and the reversible capacity was about 156 mA h g−1 at 0.1 C.

Titanate nanorods show better thermal stability than titanate nanotubes and can easily convert into rodlike morphology above 500 °C.130,131 Li4Ti5O12 nanorods were prepared after calcination of the hydrated lithium titanate precursor.127 The nanoparticles were tightly attached to form rough Li4Ti5O12 nanorods with high crystallinity as shown in Fig. 11. The interference fringe spacing was about 0.48 nm in HRTEM. The sample calcined at 800 °C maintained an initial discharge capacity of 156.2 mA h g−1 and showed a capacity retention of 95% at a current density of 50 mA g−1, owing to the good crystallinity, unique structure, and short diffusion distances.

It has been reported that spherical morphologies can minimize the length of the diffusion pathway and improve the performance of electrodes.132 In addition, the material has a high volumetric specific energy. Porous Li4Ti5O12 microspheres were successfully prepared by Shen et al.128 by a novel approach. The fabrication process was very simple and the material exhibited rich hierarchical pores, as shown in Fig. 12 and 13. The specific surface area was 57.5 m2 g−1, and the initial discharge capacity was 154.5 mA h g−1 at 2 C, while it still maintained a capacity of 147.4 mA h g−1 after 200 cycles.

5. Surface modification of Li4Ti5O12
With natural poor lithium ionic and electronic conductivity, Li4Ti5O12 exhibits reduced capacity and poor rate capability, especially at high rate.133,134 Hence, its practical use in high energy lithium-ion batteries is hindered.135,136 Various methods has been proposed to solve the problem.137,138 Surface modification is considered to be a promising way. Surface treatment can protect the core region from side reactions between the electrode and electrolyte, and prevent the loss of oxygen, the dissolution of the metal ions in the electrolyte, or simply improve the conductivity of the powder.139–141 The coating materials include carbon, graphene and carbon nanotubes, metal and relative oxide and other compounds.
5.1. Carbon coatings
The most important superiority of carbon compared to other coating materials is that it has a good electronic conductor. Carbon coating together with nanotechnology usually provides good conductivity as well as fast lithium ion diffusion, and thus also results in good rate capabilities. Hence, carbon coating has been demonstrated to be useful in enhancing the electrical conductivity of Li4Ti5O12,142–146 and it can also restrict gas evolution by preventing the electrode from contacting with the electrolyte directly.147 Moreover, the carbon layer prevents the Li+ from diffusing into the bulk Li4Ti5O12 in some extent.1 Ordinarily, carbon coating is obtained by adding the carbon precursor (glucose,148 sucrose149 and pitch150) to Li4Ti5O12 (or its precursor), mixing evenly, and then sintering at a high temperature in an inert or reducing atmosphere.151–154
Cheng et al.155 employed carbon coating via the chemical vapor deposition (CVD), and it demonstrated that Li4Ti5O12 particles can be covered by well-distributed and continuous carbon layer. Cheng and coworkers156 prepared nanostructured Li4Ti5O12 with different morphologies by a new carbon pre-coating way. Nanorods, nanoparticles and hollow spheres were included. The Li4Ti5O12 nanorods almost maintained the same morphology as the carbon-coated TiO2 rods shown in Fig. 14. The morphology of carbon layer was well retained as experiencing the huge local structural change from TiO2 to cubic Li4Ti5O12. With a uniform 5 nm-thick carbon coating, the Li4Ti5O12 delivers excellent rate performance even at high rate.

Luo et al.157 reported carbon coated Li4Ti5O12 synthesized by hydrothermal treatment using glucose as the carbon source. As shown in Fig. 15, the particle size was in the range from 10 to 100 nm and the surface of the Li4Ti5O12 nanorods was covered by a thin carbon shell coating with a thickness of 1–3 nm. Based on the electrochemical performance results in Fig. 16, the Li4Ti5O12/C nanorods achieved a reversible capacity of 92.7 mA h g−1, much higher than that of Li4Ti5O12 (Fig. 16a), and it had better cycling stability compared to the pristine nanoparticles (Fig. 16b).

Jung et al.150 reported a simple solid-state approach to synthesize microscale C–Li4Ti5O12 particles using TiO2, Li2CO3 and pitch as the reactants. The as-received TiO2 had a spherical morphology with particles of 5–10 nm (Fig. 17a). After heat treatment at 900 °C, TiO2 transformed into solid single-crystal Li4Ti5O12, and the particle shape changed to polygonal (Fig. 17b). From Fig. 17c and d a uniform carbon coating on the surface of Li4Ti5O12 was observed, and the thickness of the carbon layer was about 50 nm as the pitch content increased to 20 wt%. An anode with 5.2 wt% showed the best high rate capability, and it delivered discharge capacities of 165 mA h g−1 and 160 mA h g−1 at 1 C and 10 C, respectively.

Jung and his coworkers158 also chose low-cost pitch as the carbon source to prepare carbon-coated Li4Ti5O12. The carbon-coated Li4Ti5O12 is displayed in Fig. 18, and the carbon layer was uniformly coated on the Li4Ti5O12. The material maintained a stable capacity retention of 95% after 1000 cycles at 10 C.

Wang et al.159 synthesized Li4Ti5O12/C composites with different carbon sources, such as sucrose and conductive graphite KS-6. As illustrated in Fig. 19, the Li4Ti5O12 particles were coated by a carbon layer with a thickness of about 15–40 nm. The sample using sucrose and KS-6 as the carbon source showed the optimal rate performance. It maintained an initial specific capacity of 152.5 mA h g−1 at 0.2 C, and capacity retention of 96.8% after 1000 cycles at 25 °C at 1 C.

5.2. Graphene and carbon nanotubes modification
Graphene, a new two-dimensional carbon material, has received much attention owing to its good electron transport abilities.165–167 With high surface area, outstanding thermal properties and mechanical strength, graphene is reported as an ideal conductive additive to the composites used in lithium-ion batteries and other electrochemical devices.168–170 The composites of graphene and Li4Ti5O12 have been widely studied as high-rate anode materials for lithium-ion batteries.171–175 Li4Ti5O12/graphene nanosheets (GNS) were synthesized using a practical and efficient strategy. The fabrication process and the HRTEM images are illustrated in Fig. 20a.165 This material shows ultrahigh rate performance, especially at high rates, and the first discharge capacity reached up to 168.5 mA h g−1 at 0.1 C, while the pure Li4Ti5O12 only has 81.2 mA h g−1. Nano-crystalline Li4Ti5O12 with an average size of 18 nm is grown in graphene sheets as plotted in Fig. 20b.175 The path for the lithium-ion transfer was shortened owing to the unique nanostructure. When used as an anode for a lithium-ion battery, it delivered a capacity of 148.5 mA h g−1 at 20 C, and it retained a capacity of 159 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at 0.5 C.

Unlike other allotropes of carbon, such as diamond, graphene and fullerene (in Fig. 21), carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are a 1D tubular structure, with a length-to-diameter or aspect ratio in excess of 1000.176–178 It is considered to be a conductive substrate to host nanomaterials due to its excellent electrical conductivity, high surface area, mechanical and chemical stability.179–192 Ni et al.183 described the preparation of Li4Ti5O12/CNTs by the controlled hydrolysis of tetrabutyl titanate. It was found that the composite showed a high capacity and excellent cycle stability. To obtain a similar microstructure, Huang and Jiang adopted a sol–gel method.184 The as-prepared composite retains a discharge capacity of 142 mA h g−1 after 500 cycles at 5 C. Recently, Shu et al.185 reported Li4Ti5O12/CNTs, in which a well-dispersed conductive hyper-network formed. The TEM image and the cycling performance are shown in Fig. 22. Obviously, the composite showed a better rate performance than the pristine Li4Ti5O12.

5.3. Metal and related oxide coatings
Metal coating has been proved to be an effective way to increase the electrical conductivity of Li4Ti5O12. Liu et al. reported that the Li4Ti5O12/Ag nanocomposite displayed a higher capacity of 131 mA h g−1 at 30 C.186 Krajewski et al.187 produced Li4Ti5O12 by a three-step solid state synthesis, followed by surface modification by Ag nanoparticles. With the Ag coating, all the samples delivered a great capacity at the first charge, which was attributed to electrode activation processes or the formation of an SEI layer. The optimal amount of silver was 3 wt% according to the cyclability and high-rate tests, and it retained more than 94% of the second discharge specific capacity after 50 cycles.
Copper is widely used in doping for electrode materials owing to the high conductivity.188 It has been reported that depositing copper on LiCoO2,189 LiMn2O4,190 and LiFePO4191 can greatly enhance the electronic conductivity. Many experiments have proved that the addition of copper can improve the rate performance of Li4Ti5O12.192 Li et al.193 prepared micro-/nanoscale Cu/Li4Ti5O12 composites by a solvothermal method, and the TEM images revealed that the Cu particles were dispersed in the Li4Ti5O12 matrix. The composite with Cu content of 15 wt% showed the best performance among all the samples. It maintained an initial discharge capacity of 122.9 mA h g−1 at 20 C rate, and retains 107 mA h g−1 after 1000 cycles. Wang et al.194 synthesized Au@Li4Ti5O12 nanorod aggregates with a new strategy, and the lithium diffusion coefficient of the powder was 7.32 × 10−10 cm2 s−1. It has a stable reversible capacity of 169 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at 5 C.
As a fast lithium insertion/extraction host, TiO2 can be a promising coating material.195–204 Moreover, the Faradaic pseudocapacitive effect has recently been reported to be influential to the high-rate property of the electrode.205 The Li4Ti5O12–TiO2 dual phase nanostructure has been proven to benefit from this effect as it accelerates the surface charge transfer.117 A dual phase Li4Ti5O12 composite was prepared via a facile hydrothermal approach.206 The synthesis process is as shown in Fig. 23. The particle size was about 30 nm and the specific surface area was 91.88 m2 g−1. The nanocomposite delivered a capacity of 150 mA h g−1 at 20 C, and it exhibited a superior capacity retention of 151.4 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at a rate of 1 C.

The environmentally friendly and low-cost anatase-TiO2 is generally considered to be one of the best lithium-ion hosts among the TiO2 polymorphs, owing to its fast lithium-ion insertion/extraction, high insertion potential of 2.0 V, low volume expansion (3–4%) during lithium insertion, and high theoretical capacity of 336 mA h g−1.207–211 Actually, rutile-TiO2 as a coating layer has been found to make Li4Ti5O12@rutile-TiO2 perform better than Li4Ti5O12.212,213 Anatase-TiO2 coated Li4Ti5O12 nanorods were synthesized by a hydrothermal process with the water-in-oil microemulsion introduced.214 The coating contributed some capacity and enhanced the performance of the electrode. The powder showed much improved electrochemical characteristics in terms of excellent rate capability and cyclic stability, and it retained 96.0% of the initial capacity at a current density of 1.75 A g−1 after 100 cycles. Recently, our group developed a facile method to prepare Li4Ti5O12–TiO2 nanocomposites through which both nanosheets and nanotubes can be achieved simultaneously.215 The possible mechanism improving the electrochemical properties of Li4Ti5O12–rutile TiO2 nanocomposites is shown in Fig. 24. According to Fig. 24, in situ generated rutile-TiO2 is tightly combined with Li4Ti5O12 nanocomposites, and then can improve the Li diffusion coefficient along the c-axis. The interfaces can store electrolyte and provide more places for the reactions of lithium ion insertion/extraction, and then improve the reaction kinetics. This is why the Li4Ti5O12–TiO2 nanocomposites show lower electrochemical polarization and charge transfer resistance, and better cycling stability than pristine Li4Ti5O12. The same strategy adopted in this work could be helpful to explore and develop desired anode or cathode materials for advanced lithium-ion batteries.

Tin based alloys have been investigated as an alternate anode material for lithium-ion batteries owing to its high specific capacity.216 Oxides of Sn attract considerable attention with their promising functionality as anode materials,217–219 and various forms of Sn-based material have been applied in lithium-ion batteries.220–223 SnO2 can act as a bridge between the spinel particles to reduce the interparticle resistance and as a good material for Li intercalation/deintercalation.224–228 Hao et al.229 synthesized Li4Ti5O12–SnO2 composites by loading various amounts of nano SnO2 on Li4Ti5O12. The SnO2 particles were shown to have encapsulated on the surface of the Li4Ti5O12 uniformly and tightly. The Li4Ti5O12–SnO2 (5%) had the best cycling performance among all the samples. It delivered a discharge capacity of 189 mA h g−1 after 40 cycles at a current rate of 0.5 mA cm−2. Cai et al.230 reported the advanced synthesis and systematic investigation of Li4Ti5O12/Sn oxide composites. The effect of firing temperature was investigated, and the composite fired at 500 °C had the best rate performance. The sample maintained a capacity of 224 mA h g−1 up to 50 cycles at 100 mA g−1.
Other metal oxide coatings, such as Fe2O3,231 CuO,232 and ZrO2,233 have also been studied. Wang et al. prepared spinel Li4Ti5O12/Fe2O3 composites by a facile hydrolysis method. This anode showed excellent rate performance at high rate with discharge capacity of 109.4 mA h g−1 at 10 C rate.231 Hu et al. synthesized two kinds of Li4Ti5O12–TMO (Fe2O3 and CuO) with a two-step solution-combustion process. Both composites delivered a high reversible capacity of 172 mA h g−1 over 100 cycles, and the Li4Ti5O12/Fe2O3 anode maintained a capacity of 106 mA h g−1 at 20 C.232 Atomic layer deposition (ALD) was used to prepare a Li4Ti5O12/ZrO2 composite with the thickness controlled by adjusting the ALD cycles from 0, to 1, 2, 5, 10 and 50. In the voltage range of 0.1–2.5 V, the Li4Ti5O12 anode with 1, 2 and 5 cycles of ZrO2 coating exhibited the highest specific capacity.233
5.4. Other coatings
Li4Ti5O12 coated with other conductive films, such as AlF3,234,235 polyacene (PAS),236 poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT),237 TiN238 and Li3xLa(2/3)−xTiO3 (LLTO),239 can also enhance the rate performance. The synthesis process and electrochemical performance of Li4Ti5O12 coated with these compounds is shown in Table 3.

6. Doping
Although the surface coating described above is an efficient way to increase the electrochemical performance of electrode materials, unfortunately, the surface coating method is obviously of no help in the lattice electronic conductivity or chemical diffusion coefficient of lithium within the crystal. Substitution of a small quantity of Ti3+, Li+, or O2− with other ions greatly improves the kinetics of materials in terms of capacity delivery, cycling life, and rate capability.240 However, Li et al.241 also pointed out that ion-doped samples usually have poor crystallinity after the dopant enters the lattice structure.
6.1. Monovalent cations
It has been reported that the addition of Ag effectively improves the electronic conductivity and decreases the polarization of a cathode, and obviously increases the cycling stability and discharge performance.242–244 Huang et al.245 reported that a composite of Ag metal and Li4Ti5O12 was synthesized by a solid-state method with AgNO3 added as the reactant. They showed that Ag did not enter the structure of Li4Ti5O12, and the electronic conductivity and electrochemical performance are improved by the dispersed Ag particles. It has been reported that Na doping is an effective way to improve the rate performance of LiFePO4,246 Li3V2(PO4)3247 and other Li-based materials.248,249 Our group has reported a sub-micrometric Li4−xNaxTi5O12 (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.2) spinel synthesized by a solid-state method.250 The doping does not change the crystallographic structure of Li4Ti5O12, and the cyclability at high charge–discharge rates is better. Among the samples, Li3.85Na0.15Ti5O12 showed the best cycling performance with only 11.1% loss of capacity after 80 cycles at 2 C.
6.2. Bivalent cations
Ji et al.251 have reported that the electron conductance of Li4Ti5O12 can be improved by doping high electrovalence Mg2+ ions, and then the rate performance at high current will increase. Wang et al.252 reported an Mg-doped Li4Ti5O12 nanoparticle synthesized via a simple hydrothermal method, and the Mg-doped sample possessed a larger specific surface area and lower resistance according to first-principles simulations. The particle size was 20–30 nm and the text showed that the sample had long-term stability and high capacity, as shown in Fig. 25A.

Doping of zinc can increase the electronic conductivity and lithium-ion conductivity.253–255 Recently, our groups reported the microscale Li4Ti5−xZnxO12 (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.2) obtained by a simple solid-state process, followed by sintering at 750 °C.58 The particle size is 1–2 μm and the lattice parameter of the doping samples was slightly smaller than the pure Li4Ti5O12. The Zn-doped Li4Ti5O12 material showed very high excellent capacity retention between 0 and 2.5 V, as shown in Fig. 25B. Especially, the Li4Ti4.8Zn0.2O12 sample maintained a capacity of about 180 mA h g−1 after 200 cycles at 5 C, while the pure sample had a severe capacity decline.
Zhang et al.256 prepared Ca-doped Li4Ti5O12 with the formula Li4−xCaxTi5O12 (x = 0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2) by a solid-state reaction in an air atmosphere. Ca-doping does not change the phase structure and the particle size distribution was in the range of 1–2 μm. The doped samples delivered excellent rate performances, and Li3.9Ca0.1Ti5O12 exhibited a higher specific capacity, better rate capability and cycling performance than others, as plotted in Fig. 25C.
Kim et al.257 reported that the specific capacity of Ni-doped Li4Ti5O12 was almost double that of the spinel Li4Ti5O12. Lin et al.258 reported Li4−2xNi3xTi5−xO12 (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.25) synthesized via a solid-state reaction. XRD showed that the doping did not change the spinel structure and the morphology of Li4Ti5O12. The rate performance was improved with enhanced electronic conductivity, as shown in Fig. 25D.
The doping of Cu2+ in Li4Ti5O12 can decrease the transfer resistance of both ions and electrons.259 Lin et al.260 used a solid-state method to synthesize Cu-doped Li4Ti5O12. With the doping, the electronic conductivity and diffusion coefficient of Li+ were improved. The electrical conduction of the particles was enhanced through further carbon nanotubes (CNTs) compositing. Thus, the composite had excellent electrochemical performance, as shown in Fig. 25E.
Sr2+ has been doped for LiMn2O4, LiCoO2 and LiNi0.8Co0.2O2.261–263 Johnson et al.264 studied the charge–discharge behavior of SrTiO3 as an anode material, and found that the electrochemical behaviour can be modified due to the incorporation of Sr into Li intercalation/deintercalation compounds. Wu et al.265 reported Sr-doped Li4Ti5O12 prepared by a solid-state reaction. The results show that the Sr-doping increases the lattice parameter, reduces the particle size, and decreases the charge transfer resistance, thus the rate capability of Li4Ti5O12 was enhanced significantly, as shown in Fig. 25F.
6.3. Trivalent cations
Among all the doped samples, those doped with trivalent are noteworthy owing to their high capacity and good rate performance.266 Al3+ doping in Li4Ti5O12 has been reported to greatly improve the reversible capacity and cycling stability.267–271 Zhao et al.272 reported Li4−xAlxTi5O12 (x = 0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2) synthesized by a solid-state reaction in Ar-flowing atmosphere. Al doping did not change the particle morphology and phase composition, but easily results in lattice distortion. It can also improve the electronic conductivity of Li4Ti5O12. Thus, Al doping decreases the specific capacity of Li4Ti5O12, while increasing its cycling stability at a remarkably high rate, as shown in Fig. 26A.

(A) Li4−xAlxTi5O12 (a) x = 0, (b) x = 0.05, (c) x = 0.1, (d) x = 0.2; (B) Li4Ti5−xLaxO12 (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.2) (a) x = 0, (b) x = 0.05, (c) x = 0.1, (d) x = 0.15, (e) x = 0.2; (C) Li4Ti4.95Sc0.05O12−δ (LTSO) prepared at different temperatures (a) 240 °C, (b) 400 °C, (c) 500 °C, (d) 600 °C, (e) 700 °C, (f) 750 °C and (g) Li4Ti5O12 prepared at 750 °C. Reproduced from ref. 272, 275 and 277 with permission from Elsevier. 
Bai et al.273 prepared La–Li4Ti5O12 with excellent cycling stability and high Coulombic efficiency. Wang et al.274 reported the impact of La-doping on the morphology and electrochemical performance of Li4Ti5O12. The Li3.95La0.05Ti5O12 was synthesized by a solid-state method modified with simple ball milling, and it exhibited excellent discharge capacity and cycling stability. For further study, our groups275 investigated Li4Ti5−xLaxO12 (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.2) synthesized by a solid-state process in air. The lithium diffusion coefficient and electronic conductivity were improved, and the material delivered a capacity of 200.8 mA h g−1 at 5 C in the second cycle, as plotted in Fig. 26B.
Zhou et al.276 reported that no Jahn–Teller distortion was introduced with Sc doping. Zhang et al.277 have reported Li4Ti4.95Sc0.05O12−δ (LTSO) materials prepared by a modified sol–gel method using ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and CA (citric acid) as chelating agents. They showed that the diffraction peaks of LTSO enhance gradually and the rutile TiO2 phase decreases sharply as the firing temperature increases above 500 °C, and the grain size is about 200 nm. The electrode material exhibits excellent discharge capacities of 174 and 94 mA h g−1 at 1 C and 40 C in the first cycle, respectively, as given in Fig. 26C.
Cr3+ can effectively act as a donor because the stable structure readily formed. Research has shown that battery performance is enhanced upon doping with Cr.278–282 Song et al. found that the conductivity was improved with the band gap narrowing in the doped samples.283 Capsoni et al.284 investigated the influence of Ni- and Cr-doping on the cation distribution and functional properties: both the local and the average structural properties were strongly affected as the doping occurred on the octahedral site of the cubic spinel lattice, and only Cr leads to an increase in conductivity compared with the undoped samples.
Robertson et al.285 reported that Fe is superior to other transition metals such as Co and V owing to its abundance and low toxicity. They investigated the electrochemical behaviour and the structure of the solid solutions of Li1+xM1−3xTi1+2xO4, with M = Fe, Ni and Cr (x = 0.30). The system for M = Cr seemed preferable as the potential for the main reduction peak reduced by 0.09 V.
6.4. Multivalent cations
Lippens et al.286 reported that replacement of Ti4+ by Mo4+ tends to improve the electronic conductivity by reducing the bandgap of the electronic structure. The substitution of Ti4+ with other isovalent elements such as Zr4+, Ru4+, Nb5+, V5+, W6+, and Mo6+ can improve the electronic conductivity of Li4Ti5O12.287 Zr4+ doping can obviously improve the rate capability with smaller particle size and less agglomeration.288,289 Wang et al.290 have proposed a solid-state reaction to synthesize Li4Ti5−xZrxO12 (x = 0, 0.05, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20). XRD analysis reveals that an appropriate amount of Zr4+ can enter into the lattice structure, and all the samples show good cyclic stability, and retained about 98% of the initial capacity after 50 cycles at 1 C, as shown in Fig. 27A.

W6+-doping for cathode materials can improve the rate performance significantly.291,292 Zhang et al.293 prepared Li4Ti5−xWxO12 (x = 0.05, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2) using a sol–gel method followed by two-step calcinations in the air and Ar atmosphere, respectively. The particle size distribution is in the range of 0.5–1 μm. Li4Ti4.9W0.1O12 shows the best rate performance and stability among all samples, and the discharge capacity at 10 C maintains 128.1 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles, as shown in Fig. 27B.
Our groups have reported Li4Ti5−xNbxO12 (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.15) prepared by a solid-state method.74 The Nb-doped samples show smaller particle sizes and more regular morphology, and Li4Ti4.95Nb0.05O12 shows the best performance among all samples, as shown in Fig. 27C.
The effect of V5+-doping on Li4Ti5O12 was also investigated.62,294–296 It has been reported that the discharge capacity of Li4.25Ti4.75V0.25O12 was only 74 mA h g−1.295 Spinel Li4Ti5−xVxO12 (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.3) was successfully synthesized by a solid-state method.62 The results showed that V5+ hardly affects the lattice parameters of Li4Ti5O12. Li4Ti4.9V0.1O12 has the highest discharge capacity among all the samples at each cycle between 0.0 and 2.0 V, and it still maintains a capacity of 183 mA h g−1 after 130 cycles, as plotted in Fig. 27D. Yang et al.296 investigated a V-doped Li4Ti5O12/C composite material, and the rate performance and cycle stability were substantially improved by V doping and carbon coating.
Substituting Ti by Ru4+ can improve the electric conductivity of Li4Ti5O12.297–300 Jhan et al.299 reported Li4Ti4.99Ru0.01O12 prepared by a modified solid-state method, and the sample exhibited a high rate capability with a discharge capacity of 146 mA h g−1 at 1 C, 119 mA h g−1 at 10 C and even 107 mA h g−1 at 20 C. After a year, Li4Ti4.95Ru0.05O12 was investigated by Jhan et al.300 The Ru-doped Li4Ti5O12 can provide discharge capacities of 222 mA h g−1 at 1 C and 132 mA h g−1 at 10 C. The capacity retentions were 92% and 86% for 5 C and 10 C, respectively as shown in Fig. 27E.
Mo-doping can enhance the intrinsic conductivity and lithium-ion diffusion coefficient, thus improving the rate performance of TiO2 and LiFePO4.301,302 Our groups reported Li4Ti5−xMoxO12 (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.2) via a simple solid-state method.303 The doped samples display a larger diffusion coefficient of lithium ions, higher rate capability and good reversibility, and maintain considerable capacities at a high rate of 6 C, as plotted in Fig. 27F.
6.5. Non-metal ions
At present, very little research has focused on the doping of non-metal anions to improve the rate performance of Li4Ti5O12 at a high current density. Wang et al.304 fabricated Li4Ti5O11.7Br0.3 with a conventional solid state method, and it showed an enhanced rate capacity. Qi et al.305 reported Li4Ti5O12−xBrx (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.3) synthesized by a solid-state reaction. Li4Ti5O11.8Br0.2 showed the best discharge capacity among all the samples, and it obtained a discharge capacity of 172 mA h g−1 at 0.5 C, close to its theoretical capacity (175 mA h g−1), as given in Fig. 28a. CV shows that Br-doping does not change the electrochemical reaction process of Li4Ti5O12 in the voltage range from 1.0 to 3.0 V.
 Fig. 28  Electrochemical performance of un-doped and doped Li4Ti5O12 samples with different rates: (a) Br-doped Li4Ti5O12,305 (b) F-doped Li4Ti5O12 (ref. 306) and (c) N-doped Li4Ti5O12.311 Reproduced from ref. 305, 306 and 311 with permission from Elsevier. 
Zhao et al.306 investigated F-doped Li4Ti5O12 with different fluorine contents. Li4Ti5O12−xFx (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.3) was synthesized via a solid-state method. The F-doped samples showed increased initial discharge voltage at a density of 85 mA g−1 as shown in Fig. 28b. This can be attributed to the substitution of F− into the O2− sites, leading to a decrease in the charge transfer resistance and improvement of the lithium ion diffusion.
Nitrogen doping has been proved to be a practical method to improve the rate cyclic capability of Li4Ti5O12.307–310 Wang et al.311 prepared N-doped Li4Ti5O12 nanosheets via a simple hydrothermal with further heat treatment at a low temperature of 500 °C under NH3 atmosphere. It exhibits a higher rate capability of 151.8 mA h g−1 at 10 C than that of the pure Li4Ti5O12 as shown in Fig. 28c, and CV suggests that N-doping is favorable for the reduction of electrode polarization.
As mentioned, both cation doping and anion doping can enhance the conductivity of Li4Ti5O12, so cation and anion co-doping is considered.312 Xu et al. obtained Al3+ and F− co-doped Li4Ti5O12 samples, which exhibited significantly improved rate performances.234 Ji et al. reported the effects of La3+ and F− co-doping on the electrochemical properties of Li4Ti5O12.313 They also found that La3+ and F− co-doping can improve the rate cyclic capability of Li4Ti5O12 markedly, and the Li3.95La0.05Ti5O11.7F0.3 sample showed the best rate performance among all the samples.
In order to better understand why doping is promising for the performance enhancement of Li4Ti5O12, the positive and negative effects of different doping ions on electrochemical performance are briefly summarized in Table 4.

7. Summary and outlook
This review gives an overview of Li4Ti5O12 anode materials being developed for applications in EVs, PHEVs, and HEVs. The rapid development of lithium-ion batteries leads to high demand for safe, long-life and high energy density anode materials. Combined with the merits of environmental friendliness and low cost, the spinel Li4Ti5O12 material has been demonstrated to be the most promising anode material in practical energy application. Among all the reported synthesis routes, the solid-state approach is simple and easy for industrial production; the hydrothermal method has attracted much attention for the preparation of nano-structured Li4Ti5O12 in recent years. Issues of poor rate capability and low specific capacity can be ameliorated with such nano structures. For realization of wide industrial application, some clean, easily controllable routes to producing high-quality Li4Ti5O12 material at low cost should be developed. From a commercial viewpoint, the solid-state synthesis of Li4Ti5O12 powders exhibits a potential commercial application due to the simple synthesis route and low synthesis cost.
The problems of low electronic conductivity and poor rate performance must be solved before Li4Ti5O12 can realize practical application in the area of EVs and HEVs.
In the future, it is anticipated that the solution to the problem will be nanocrystallization, doping or surface coating. Hence, several challenges of Li4Ti5O12 such as carbon coating and size reduction should be addressed without compromising the volumetric density to exploit applications in commercial lithium-ion batteries. In addition, the preparation of different morphologies including core–shell structures, spherical structures, porous structures or nano-micro structures can also be used to improve the rate performance of Li4Ti5O12. Developing doped high-performance Li4Ti5O12 using earth-abundant elements is more desirable and noble metals (such as Ru, Au, Ag, etc.)-free, Na, Zn and Al-doped Li4Ti5O12 are some of the most attractive choices used in commercial lithium-ion batteries. Further research will focus on the high rate performance of Li4Ti5O12. Doping and surface coating with fast ionic conductors or by simple techniques with low-cost methods should be developed. The reaction between Li4Ti5O12 and the electrolyte at the intrinsic boundary usually generates gas in the storage and charge–discharge process. Surface coating has been regarded as an effective way to restrain the gas generation of full Li4Ti5O12 batteries. In addition, systematic studies on the mechanism of lithium insertion/extraction using first-principles calculations combined with experimental methods are also helpful for a better fundamental understanding of the relationship between the structure and electrochemical characteristics. As an optimistic view, we believe that the way to solve these challenging problems will be found in the near future.

Solid-state reaction	Li2CO3 and TiO2 are mixed as precursors evenly, then heat-treated at high temperature (600–1000 °C) in air for 10–20 h	It has a potential commercial application due to the simple synthesis route and low synthesis cost	They often suffer from a series of problems, such as inhomogeneity, irregular morphology, uncontrollable particle growth and agglomeration	The kinetic performance and capacity contribution of Li4Ti5O12, especially at high charge–discharge rates, is poor
Microwave processing	Li2CO3 and TiO2 are mixed and ball-milled as precursors. Then the precursors are heated in a microwave system	Microwave heating can ensure higher penetration depth and low synthesis temperature	This process has higher synthesis costs	Li4Ti5O12 has a high rate capacity and excellent reversibility during high charge and discharge rates
Molten-salt synthesis	TiO2, LiOH·H2O, LiCl and KCl were mixed and ground. The mixed powders were calcined at 800 °C for 8 h in air, and then naturally cooled to room temperature	As reaction media, molten salts can provide a liquid reaction environment, and then accelerate the formation reaction of Li4Ti5O12 with high purity and narrow particle size distribution	It is difficult to find proper molten media. The high calcination temperature and energy consumption hinder its practical application	Li4Ti5O12 has a high initial discharge capacity and good rate performance
Sol–gel synthesis	Stoichiometric lithium salt and Ti source were dissolved in ethanol solution of organic acid to obtain a gel. The resulting gelatin was dried yield to obtain organic precursors. The gel precursors were preheated at 500–800 °C in air to obtain Li4Ti5O12 powders	This method offers Li4Ti5O12 products with a homogeneous distribution of uniform, sub-micron size particles with good stoichiometry control	The disadvantages are high synthetic cost, complexity of synthetic route, lower utilization of the reactor, and the generation of CO2 gas	Li4Ti5O12 synthesized by the sol–gel method often has a high discharge capacity and good cycling performance
Hydrothermal synthesis	Ti source and lithium salt were dispersed in organic solvent under magnetic stirring, and then some water was added under stirring to achieve a milky suspension, which was then transferred to a Teflon-lined autoclave for solvothermal treatment at 180–220 °C for 24–48 h	The advantages of hydrothermal synthesis are fast reaction kinetics, phase purity with narrow particle-size distributions, high crystallinity, homogeneous particle products, low temperature post-calcinations, and environmentally benign	The hydrothermal processes need expensive stainless-steel autoclaves and Teflon liners, expensive organic reagents used as raw materials, and subsequent complicated washing processes of the products, and limit the mass production	The electrochemical reversibility, lithium ion diffusion, and conductivity can be obviously improved. They often exhibit superior rate performance and high capacity even at high charge–discharge rates
