    , Accepted 25th February 2013First published on 26th February 2013AbstractA new kind of solvent-free eutectic melt electrolytes for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) has been designed, which are composed of imidazolium salts (i.e. 1-methyl-3-acetylimidazolium iodide (MAII), 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide (EMII)) and plastic crystal succinonitrile (SN). Differential scanning calorimetric measurement reveals that the eutectic melt mixture EMII/SN can exhibit stable liquid state in the whole temperature domain from −80 to 80 °C. Besides, the conductivities of the eutectic melt electrolytes are higher than conventional imidazolium-based ionic liquid, 1-propyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide (PMII). Up to 7.46% of light-to-electricity conversion efficiency has been achieved by using the SN-based eutectic melt electrolyte, higher than PMII-based DSCs. Besides, the devices based on eutectic melt electrolytes exhibit good thermal stability. These results show that succinonitrile-based eutectic melts as environmentally friendly electrolytes, possess great potential for large-scale outdoor application of DSCs.
Introduction
The nanocrystalline dye-sensitized solar cell (DSC), which was first brought forward by O'Regan and Grätzel from EPFL in 1991, is a non-conventional solar-electrical technology.1 Due to its prominent advantages, such as low production cost, easy fabrication, multi-colour options etc, the DSC has attracted wide scientific and industrial attention in recent years.1,2 This kind of solar cell mimics photosynthesis in plant, which collect the photons via monolayer dye molecules adsorbed onto the TiO2 photoanode with the porous matrix. Photoexcitation of the dye is followed by ultrafast electron injection into the conduction band of the TiO2, leaving the dye with its oxidized state. Then, the electrons diffuse through the TiO2 matrix, the conducting glass, external circuit and finally arrive at the counter electrode. The dye is regenerated by receiving the electrons from the reduced species (i.e. I− ions) in the electrolyte, while the oxidized species (i.e. I3− ions) in the electrolyte are revivified on the surface of the counter electrode, hereto, the DSC completes one running cycle.3,4 Up to date, the best power conversion efficiency of small-size DSCs has already exceeded 11% while the DSC module demonstrated 9.9% efficiency.5,6 Currently, significant market exploitation is on the way.
In DSCs, the electrolyte fulfils two major tasks, one for dye regeneration and the other for charge transport between two electrodes, typically through the ion diffusion mechanism. Obviously, the choice of the redox shuttle, the viscosity of the electrolyte extending to its physical property will strongly influence the photovoltaic performance as well as the cell stability. At present, relatively high efficiencies of the DSCs are commonly based on liquid electrolytes with volatile solvents (i.e. acetonitrile), however, volatile solvents can easily leak and evaporate to create both short- and long-term sealing problems, which lay an additional burden on the final cost.7 For this reason, there have been many efforts to replace liquid electrolytes by quasi-solid or solid state electrolytes, such as p-type inorganic semiconductors (i.e. CuI, CuSCN etc),8,9 organic hole transportation materials (i.e. spiro-OMeTAD (2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis (N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spiro-bifluorene), PEDOT (poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene))),10,11 polymer electrolytes (i.e. PEO/PVDF (poly(ethylene oxide)/poly(vinylidene fluoride)), PHEMA(poly(β-hydroxyethylmethacrylate))),12,13 quasi-solid state gel electrolytes,14,15 solid-state composite electrolytes based on lithium iodide addition compounds16–18 and so on. Unfortunately, some disadvantages including low hole conductivity and unsatisfactory TiO2/electrolyte interfacial property have so far limited the cell performance as well as wide application.19
Another alternative is solvent-free liquid electrolytes. Room temperature ionic liquids (RTILs), simultaneously as promising solvents and iodide resource, have been extensively investigated in DSCs due to their high conductivity, low evaporation pressure, wide electrochemical window, good thermal and chemical stability etc.14,20,21 Especially, imidazolium iodide-based ionic liquids, such as PMII (1-propyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide), BMII (1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide) and HMII (1-hexyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide) etc., are commonly used in DSCs.20 However, imidazolium iodide-based RTILs usually have relatively high viscosity, as a consequence, the device always suffers the mass-transport limitation. Binary IL electrolytes are generally adopted to improve this mass transport limitation by using low-viscosity ILs (e.g.1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium thiocyanate, selenocyanate, tricyanomethide and tetracyanoborate), and over 7% of device efficiency have been achieved.15,22–24 But the application of these low-viscosity ILs could have to face some potential problems, such as high price, toxicity, purity as well as thermal and chemical stability. Therefore, seeking new solvent-free electrolyte systems, which hold the advantages, i.e. cost-effective, thermally and chemically robust and highly efficient, is still a tough work.
Very recently, eutectic melt mixtures as solvent-free liquid electrolytes for DSCs have brought much attention.25,26 Wang and Grätzel et al. employed the EMII/DMII/AMII eutectic melt electrolyte into the cell, which can present an inspiring efficiency of 8.2% and are thus considered to be a new clue for developing highly efficient and stable electrolytes.25 At present, the key to the eutectic melt electrolytes lies on the rational design of their compositions to meet the requirements such as high conductivity, low viscosity, ideally thermal and chemical stability. Succinonitrile (SN) is a kind of molecular plastic crystal, which possesses the gauche conformation below 233 K and undergoes a first-order transition (gauche–trans isomerization) to a plastic phase at 233 K. Its plastic phase is stable between 233 and 331 K. Previous study revealed that the molecules in the plastic phase exist in three isomeric conformations: two (identical) gauche isomers and one trans isomer, which are interrelated by 120° rotation around the central C–C bond.27,28 And these three conformers in SN are supposed to have strong effect on the diffusion capability of the molecules, where the trans isomers act as “impurities” to create mono-vacancies in the lattice and thus leading to high molecular diffusivity. Its high polarity and plastic-crystal characteristics make SN an effective component in the electrolyte for electrochemical devices, such as fuel cells, lithium rechargeable batteries and DSCs.27 Solid-state electrolytes based on SN have already been investigated by several groups.29–31 However, to our knowledge, there is still no SN-based eutectic melt electrolytes for DSCs so far. Herein, solvent-free eutectic melt electrolytes were designed for DSCs, which were based on the mixtures of ionic liquid crystals (MAII (1-methyl-3-acetyl-imidazolium iodide) or EMII (1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide)) and SN. Up to 7.46% of light-to-electricity conversion efficiency has been achieved by using EMII/SN electrolyte, higher than the conventional PMII-based electrolyte. Besides, they exhibit good thermal stability and potential application in the future.
Experimental section
Materials
1-Methyl-3-acetylimidazolium iodide (MAII), 1-ethyl-3-methyl imidazolium iodide (EMII) and 1-propyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide (PMII) were synthesized as reported previously.32,33 Succinonitrile (SN, AR grade, Alfa-Aesar), 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP, ≥98%, GC, Fluka), LiI (99.9%, Aldrich), acetonitrile (ACN, HPLC, Fisher), 3-methoxy propionitrile (MPN, ≥ 98%, GC, Aldrich) were commercially available and used without further treatment. The ruthenium dye N719 (cis-bis(isothiocyanato)-bis(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylato)Ru(II) bis-TBA, TBA = tert-butylamine) was from Dyesol, Australia. Fluorine-doped SnO2 conducting glass (FTO, thickness: 2.5 mm, sheet resistance: 15 Ω square−1) were from Pilkington. Before use, it was first washed with mild detergent, subsequently rinsed with distilled water for several times and with ethanol in an ultrasonic bath, finally dried under air stream.
The eutectic melt electrolytes were prepared by mixing ionic liquid crystal (MAII or EMII) with SN in an appropriate weight ratio, and kept stirring until a homogeneous solution was formed. To MAII/SN systems, preheating (45 °C) is needed during the preparation. In order to achieve the electrolytes for DSCs, I2 was added into the electrolyte in a molar ratio with iodide compounds as 1:10 and an additive TBP was kept 0.5 M in these electrolytes. For comparison, the PMII-based electrolyte and conventional liquid electrolyte containing LiI (0.1 M), PMII (0.9 M), I2 (0.1 M) and TBP (0.5 M) in ACN/MPN (volume ratio 1:4) were also prepared with the same I3−/I− molar ratio.
Assembly of the DSC device
The TiO2 photoanode with a double-layer structure consisting of a 10 μm-thickness transparent layer with 20 nm-size anatase TiO2 particles and a 3 μm-thickness light-scattering layer with 300 nm-size rutile TiO2 particles, was prepared by using a doctor-blading technique.34 The TiO2 film was sintered at 450 °C for 30 min. Finally, the TiO2 film was treated by 50 mM aqueous TiCl4 solution at 70 °C, rinsed with water for several times and sintered at 500 °C for 30 min. After cooling down to 80 °C, it was immersed into a 0.3 mM ethanolic N719 solution overnight. 5 μL of eutectic melt electrolyte was dropped on the surface of the dye-coated TiO2 photoanode, which was clamped with a Pt sputtered FTO as the counter electrode to give a sandwich-type cell. A mask with a window of 0.15 cm2 was clipped on the TiO2 side to define the active area of the cell.
Characterization
The thermal properties of the eutectic melts were measured by differential scanning calorimetric analysis using TA-Q100 at a scanning rate of 10 °C min−1. Infrared spectra were performed on a TENSOR 27 spectrometer, Bruker.
Electrochemical measurement
The electrochemical measurements, such as ionic conductivities, steady-state voltammograms and electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were determined on Zahner IM6e Electrochemistry Workstation. The ionic conductivities in the temperature range from 27 to 80 °C were determined by ac impedance technique in a frequency range from 3 × 106 to 5 Hz. The samples were kept at the testing temperature for an hour before measurement. The steady-state voltammograms were conducted by using a two-electrode system equipped with Pt ultra-microelectrode (radius 5 μm) as a working electrode and Pt wire as a counter electrode at the scan rate of 10 mV s−1. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was determined in the frequency range from 1 × 105 to 0.1 Hz under AM 1.5 illumination of 100 mW cm−2 over an open circuit potential Voc. The obtained impedance spectra were fitted with the Zview software in terms of an appropriate equivalent circuit.
Photoelectrochemical measurements
The cells were illuminated by Oriel Solar Simulator 91192 under 100 mW cm−2 (AM 1.5). The incident light intensity was measured by Oriel 70260 radiant power/energy meter. Photocurrent density–photovoltage (J–V) curves of DSCs were recorded on Princeton Applied Research, model 263 A. Incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) of solar cells was carried out by dc method using our lab-made IPCE setup, which was illuminated under 0.3–0.9 mW cm−2 monochromic light without bias light.35,36 To test the stability of DSCs, the devices were sealed which detailed procedure was according to the reference.37 For comparison, the DSCs with conventional liquid electrolyte were also fabricated. The cells were stored in an oven at 60 °C over 1000 h. Prior to each measurement, aged cells were illuminated for 30 min. The data were collected after equilibration at room temperature.
Results and discussion
Physical states and thermal property
As we know, pure MAII and EMII are white crystals while succinonitrile (SN) is a kind of solid plastic crystal with melting point temperature of 59 °C, which may restrict their practical application in DSCs.32,37 When MAII or EMII are mixed with SN in an appropriate weight ratio, however, their physical properties change. For MAII/SN system with the weight ratio 1:2, homogeneous eutectic melt is obtained when being heated at 45 °C, which is still in a liquid state after cooling down to 30 °C. By contrast, the EMII/SN system in a weight ratio of EMII/SN ranging from 2:1 to 1:3 can be in the liquid state at room temperature.
In order to understand the phase transformation behavior of the two eutectic melt systems, MAII/SN and EMII/SN, differential scanning calorimetric scans were recorded. As shown in Fig. 1, pure SN exhibits plastic crystal phase in the range −40–57 °C, while its solid–solid transition temperature (Ttr) and melting point (Tm) are −36 °C and 59 °C, respectively. After mixing with MAII in a weight ratio 1:2 of MAII to SN, the Ttr and Tm were slightly down-shifted to −38 °C and 55 °C, respectively, as expected that the transition is an equilibrium thermodynamic phase change related to the structural changes of the matrix phase.38 This is in agreement with other SN-based electrolyte systems.29 Besides, an additional peak is observed, which solid–liquid phase transition temperature is 39.8 °C. This could be attributed to the formation of MAII/SN composite system. However, for the EMII/SN system in a weight ratio 1:2, all peaks disappear, indicating that the EMII/SN eutectic melt system is always in the liquid state in the whole testing temperature ranging from −80 to 80 °C. It is suggested that the decrease of the melting temperature is due to the increase in entropy of the components in the eutectic mixture.39,40 Therefore, the EMII/SN eutectic melt, which melting temperature can be significantly reduced, shows potential as a solvent-free electrolyte for DSCs.

Investigation on electrical properties
As we know, the conductivity of the electrolyte is an important parameter for highly efficient DSCs. To the EMI/SN eutectic melts, the conductivities with different weight ratios of EMII to SN were first investigated. As we can see from Fig. 2, to the EMII/SN eutectic melt systems, their conductivities increase first and then decrease with continuous increasing the content of EMII. Concretely speaking, when the weight ratio of EMII/SN changes from 1:5 to 1:2, the conductivities increases from 5.99 × 10−3 to 1.07 × 10−2 S cm−1, then with the EMII continuously adding, the conductivity decreases instead. Apparently, the conductivity is strongly dependent on the concentration of EMII in the eutectic melt system. Only when the concentration of EMII is relatively lower, the electrostatic attraction between the cation and anion is significantly weakened, which is beneficial to the charge transport and thus giving relatively higher conductivity. Therefore, the weight ratio of EMII and SN is adopted as 1:2 in the following discussion. By contrast with the EMII/SN eutectic melt systems, the conductivity of MAII/SN system in the weight ratio 1:2 can only exhibit 1.272 × 10−3 S cm−1.
 Fig. 2  Relationship between the conductivity and the weight ratios of EMII to SN at room temperature. 
Moreover, specific ionic conductivities in the temperature range from 25 to 80 °C were explored. As shown in Fig. 3, the eutectic melt systems, MAII/SN and EMII/SN, can present similar conductivity-temperature relationship, that is, the conductivity increases while elevating temperature. For comparison, temperature-dependent conductivities of the pure PMII is also given, which shows the similar uptrend as the eutectic melt systems. Faster ion movement is supposed to be the main reason to the above relationship. Although the trend of conductivity versus temperature for MAII/SN and EMII/SN eutectic melt systems is similar, the distinction among them can also be seen clearly. First, PMII can give a greater slope than the other two testing systems, suggesting that it is more sensitive to the temperature. Secondly, to the MAII/SN eutectic melt system, when the temperature is above 40 °C, its conductivities as a function of the temperature shows a better linearity. Thirdly, to EMII/SN eutectic melt system, the conductivity is higher than those of PMII and MAII/SN eutectic melt system in the whole temperature range. Obviously, relatively weak intermolecular interaction in the EMII/SN system will lead to weaker ion electrostatic attraction between cation and anion, and thus higher conductivity as well.
 Fig. 3  Arrhenius plots of conductivities of solvent-free eutectic melts systems EMII/SN, MAII/SN and ionic liquid PMII in the temperature range from 298 to 353 K. 
A better fit to the Arrhenius equation as the following eqn (1) is observed:  σ = A exp(−Ea/RT)(1)where σ is the conductivity, A is a pre-exponential factor, Ea is the activation energy, R is the molar gas constant and T is the absolute temperature. According to the eqn (1), the Ea of EMII/SN and MAII/SN systems are estimated to be 14.46 and 20.88 kJ mol−1, respectively, lower than that of the pure PMII (Ea = 41.87 kJ mol−1). The Arrhenius characteristics about the conductivities in the given temperature range together with the low activation energies suggest that the ions can diffuse freely in our eutectic melt-based liquid electrolytes.
In terms of the above results, it can be deduced that the introduction of SN can effectively increase disassociation of cation and anion of the ionic liquid crystals, thus leading to relatively lower Ea as well as lower energy barrier of ion transportation and facilitating the I3−/I− ion movement in the electrolyte.
Diffusion ability of the electrolytes
When iodine and 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) were added into the eutectic melts, the electrolytes for DSCs were obtained. The diffusion properties of I−/I3− ions in the electrolyte were first investigated. Fig. 4 presents steady-state voltammograms of EMII/SN and MAII/SN-based electrolytes. For comparison, the diffusion property of the PMII-based electrolyte is also given.
 Fig. 4  Steady-state voltammograms of solvent-free eutectic melt-based electrolytes and the PMII-based electrolyte with a Pt ultramicroelectrode. 
The apparent diffusion coefficient (Dapp) is calculated by following the eqn (2):  Iss = 4nFDappCa(2)where n is the number of charge transfer per molecule, F is the Faraday constant, C is the bulk concentration of the electroactive species in the electrolyte, a is the radius of Pt ultramicroelectrode, Dapp is the apparent diffusion coefficient and Iss is the anodic or cathodic steady-state current.14 As shown in Table 1, for the EMII/SN-based electrolyte, the apparent diffusion coefficients of I− and I3− ions are 2.05 × 10−6 and 1.28 × 10−6 cm2 S−1, respectively, larger than those of MAII/SN-based electrolyte, 5.6 × 10−7 and 4.4 × 10−7 cm2 S−1. Furthermore, their apparent diffusion coefficients are larger than those of ionic liquid PMII-based electrolyte (4.9 × 10−7 cm2 S−1 for I− ions and 3.3 × 10−7 cm2 S−1 for I3− ions). Particularly for EMII/SN-based electrolyte system is 4 times larger than that in pure PMII, which can be rationalized in terms of a Grotthus-like exchange mechanism and described by Dahms–Ruff equation.41 In fact, according to the literature, the equilibrium potential of I−/I3− redox couple in the electrolyte can be determined by the potentials where the current becomes zero by ultramicroelectrode technique.42 As can be seen from Fig. 4, the equilibrium potentials of the eutectic melt-based electrolyte systems are quite similar and comparable to the PMII-based electrolyte as well.

Furthermore, the reason for the discrepancy on apparent diffusion coefficients of MAII/SN and EMII/SN-based electrolytes was explored in detail. For MAII and EMII, there are different substitution groups in the peripheral imidazolium cycle, acetyl group of MAII and ethyl group of EMII. In general, the acetyl group can bring strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding, which will significantly influence the I3−/I− ion diffusion in the electrolyte. Here, FT-IR spectra have been used to further understand the interaction between MAII and SN.
As shown in Fig. 5, two new peaks at 3587 and 1705 cm−1 are observed in the MAII/SN eutectic melt system in comparison with pure SN and MAII, which are assigned to the N⋯H–O stretching vibration νN⋯H–O, blue-shifted carboxylate stretching vibration νCOOH, respectively. Obviously, intermolecular hydrogen bond between MAII molecules or between MAII and SN goes against the I3−/I− ion diffusion, which is in agreement with its relatively low Dapp(I−) and Dapp(I3−).

Application in DSCs

Fig. 6(a) shows the photocurrent density–photovoltage (J–V) curves of DSCs using two eutectic melt-based electrolytes under AM 1.5 illumination (100 mW cm−2), and the detailed parameters are given in Table 1. For the DSC with the EMII/SN-based electrolyte, the short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF) are 14.8 mA cm−2, 674 mV, 0.75, respectively, yielding 7.46% of conversion efficiency (η). However, only 6.24% of the conversion efficiency is obtained by using MAII/SN-based electrolyte, which is supposed to be a result of lower I3−/I− diffusion coefficients. Moreover, the cells with eutectic melt-based electrolytes can give higher conversion efficiencies in comparison with that with PMII-based electrolyte (η = 5.40%), which is likewise related to the low conductivity and I3−/I− diffusion coefficients of PMII-based electrolyte. This improvement of the efficiency for SN-based electrolytes mainly lies on the presence of succinonitrile (SN), which can significantly lower the viscosity of the electrolyte.
 Fig. 6  (a) Photocurrent density–photovoltage (J–V) curves of DSCs based on solvent-free eutectic melts electrolytes and PMII-based electrolyte under AM 1.5 illumination (100 mW cm−2); (b) Incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) plots of the DSCs based on three kinds of electrolytes. 
The photocurrent action spectra of the three DSCs with EMII/SN, MAII/SN and PMII-based electrolytes are also presented in Fig. 6(b). The DSCs with EMII/SN and MAII/SN-based electrolytes can present almost the same IPCE curves, with the maximum values of 73.2% and 72.4% at 550 nm, respectively, whereas the maximum IPCE value of the PMII-based DSC is only 59.3% at 550 nm. As we can see in Fig. 6(b), the shapes of IPCE spectra of MAII/SN and EMII/SN-based DSCs are different from the PMII-based DSC in the wavelength range from 400 to 500 nm, which is typically in accordance with the absorption of I− and I3− ions.43 It is thus inferred that this difference may be due to relatively higher I− and I3− concentrations of PMII-based electrolyte compared to those of MAII/SN and EMII/SN-based electrolytes.
The dependence of photocurrent density Jsc on light intensities for DSCs using our eutectic melt-based electrolytes is presented in Fig. 7. A good linear dependence of Jsc on radiant power ranging from 10 to 100 mW cm−2 is observed for the two testing systems, indicating that the low viscosity of the two eutectic electrolytes allows sufficient I3− ion transportation in the electrolyte.33,44,45 For comparison, the dependence of Jsc on the light intensities for the DSC with PMII-based electrolyte was also carried out. In our case, the cell fabrication is identical except for using different electrolytes, that is to say, the electrolyte is the only variable factor while all others are constant. Obviously, the Jsc depends strongly on the amount of I3−ion in the electrolyte and the dye recovery rate. Namely, the transportations of I− and I3− ions between the TiO2 photoanode and Pt electrode will remarkably influence the photocurrent Jsc and overall cell performance. Moreover, under low illumination, no more difference on the Jsc was observed for the three devices. With increasing illumination intensities, the Jsc of EMII/SN-based and MAII/SN-based electrolytes are nearly the same, however, for PMII-based electrolyte, the slope is smaller than the two eutectic melt electrolytes, indicating that relatively higher viscosity and lower conductivity of PMII-based electrolyte are the main reasons for this discrepancy.

Electrochemical impedance spectra
As we know, there are three spatially separated interfaces in the DSC, where different electron transfer processes including unfavorable recombination reactions occur. Electrochemical impedance spectrum (EIS) is a simple and effective tool to analyze these interfacial charge transfer behaviors.46 Here, in order to further understand the influence of the eutectic melt-based electrolytes on interfacial electron transfer and recombination reactions as well as the cell performance, EIS measurement was carried out under AM 1.5 illumination of 100 mW cm−2 over an open circuit potential Voc. Fig. 8 presents typical Nyquist plots of the three cells using solvent-free EMII/SN and MAII/SN eutectic melt electrolytes and PMII-based electrolyte. Experimental curves are represented by symbols. As seen in Fig. 8(a), two characteristic arcs in the Nyquist plot can be clearly distinguished, which represent the photo-injected electron transfer in the TiO2 matrix or back reaction concerning the injected electrons from the TiO2 to the electrolyte in the medium frequency range 103–1 Hz, and the redox reaction on the counter electrode in the high frequency range 105–103 Hz, respectively.47 For the cells with EMII/SN and PMII-based electrolytes, the arc related to the electrolyte diffusion in the low frequency range 0.1–10 Hz is hidden by the charge-transfer resistance at TiO2 electrode/dye/electrolyte interface, whereas this arc is observed for the cell with MAII/SN-based electrolyte. These experimental curves are fitted by using the equivalent circuit shown in Fig. 8(b).15,47 In the equivalent circuit, the symbol R describes a resistance and CPE represents the constant phase element. In order to simply the fitting process, the Warburg diffusion of the electrolyte in a finite-length region is omitted. The CPE is a non-ideal frequency dependent capacitance, which is associated with a distribution of relaxation times or with a non-uniform distribution of current due to materials heterogeneity. CPE can generally be expressed by Y = Yo(jω)n, where n is a constant ranging from 0 to 1 (0 ≤ n ≤1).48 The fitted curves represented as the solid lines are given in Fig. 8(a), and the fitted parameters are illustrated in Table 2.

According to our fitted results, there is no distinct difference on Rs between MAII/SN and PMII-based electrolytes, which are higher than that of EMII/SN-based electrolyte. At the Pt/electrolyte interface, Rct1 value is increasing in the order of EMII/SN, MAII/SN and PMII-based electrolytes, indicating the charge exchange ability at the Pt electrode is also influenced by the I3− diffusion ability in the electrolytes. This result is in agreement with relatively high conductivity and diffusion coefficient of the EMII/SN-based electrolyte. Charge transfer resistances (Rct2) at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface are 16.5 Ω, 16.6 Ω and 15.8 Ω for the EMII/SN, MAII/SN and PMII-based electrolytes, respectively, indicating that similar electron recombination at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface occurs for the three electrolytes. Besides, relatively lower conductivity and reduced Nernst diffusion coefficient of I3− in MAII/SN-based electrolyte are supposedly the main reasons to exhibit obvious arc in the low frequency region in comparison with EMII/SN-based electrolyte.48–50
Preliminary thermal stability test

Fig. 9 presents the variation in the conversion efficiencies of the DSCs based on EMII/SN eutectic melt electrolyte and conventional I3−/I−-based liquid electrolyte over 40 days aging test at 60 °C. After 40 days, the photocurrent Jsc of the cell based on this eutectic melt electrolyte decreased by 23% while the Voc dropped by 48 mV, which was compensated for the increase in FF from 0.55 to 0.72, and the device thus retained 92% of its initial value. On the contrary, the DSC with the conventional liquid electrolyte in ACN/MPN mixture can only keep 51% of its initial efficiency. Obviously, the cell with the EMII/SN eutectic melt electrolyte exhibits better long-term thermal stability.51 It is suggested that very low evaporation pressure in this volatile solvent free electrolyte is included, which even can be effectively avoided. This good stability shows potential application of our eutectic melt-based electrolytes in the future commercialization.

Conclusions
A new kind of solvent-free eutectic melts electrolyte for dye-sensitized solar cells is prepared by mixing ionic liquid crystal MAII or EMII with plastic crystal succinonitrile (SN), and a 7.46% conversion efficiency has been achieved. This solvent-free electrolyte exhibits fine thermal properties and high ionic conductivity. The DSCs using this electrolyte shows better performance than conventional ionic liquid PMII-based electrolyte. This solvent-free eutectic melts electrolyte exhibits relatively higher efficiency compared to organic solvent contained electrolyte, and can maybe facilitate the practical application in large-scale or flexible dye-sensitized solar cells.
