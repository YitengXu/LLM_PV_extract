    , Accepted 9th October 2018First published on 10th October 2018AbstractSemiconductor photocatalysis provides a promising potential solution to the challenging issue of clean energy production. Construction of multijunction systems is an effective strategy to overcome the serious drawbacks of fast charge recombination and the limited visible-light absorption of semiconductor photocatalysts. Here, we report a novel quaternary heterogeneous photocatalyst fabricated by loading Ag nanoparticles onto ZnO nanowires and subsequent simultaneous formation of core/shell structured ZnO@ZnS and Ag@Ag2S heterojunctions via a one-step anion-exchange sulfuration reaction process. The resulting four-component ZnO@ZnS/Ag@Ag2S multijunction photocatalyst exhibits a high hydrogen evolution activity (140.3 μmol g−1) under simulated solar light irradiation in 5 h, far exceeding those of bare ZnO (30.8 μmol g−1), ZnO@ZnS (92.8 μmol g−1) and ZnO/Ag (45.1 μmol g−1) counterparts. The enhanced photocatalytic activity can be attributed to the synergetic effect of the formation of both Z-scheme and type II core/shell heterojunctions, favoring light absorption and separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs in the composite. This work provides a facile, controlled method for the fabrication of multicomponent heterostructures used for efficient solar water splitting.
1. Introduction
As global demand for the production of energy increases, developing clean and low-cost renewable energy resources has become a key challenge. Solar power is arguably the cleanest, most reliable form of renewable energy available. Therefore, it is important to develop effective strategies for direct capture and conversion of solar energy into a usable energy form.1 Given the simplicity and environmental friendliness of the process, photocatalytic water splitting has been regarded as one of the most promising methods for converting solar energy into chemical energy in the form of H2, a clean and renewable energy carrier.2–4 The major limiting factors affecting the efficiency of most single semiconductor photocatalysts include mismatch between the semiconductor band gap and the solar spectrum, low efficient charge separation and transportation, and material instability. To solve these problems, various methodologies have been developed in the past few decades to expand the spectral response of semiconductor photocatalysts toward the visible light region and to minimize the recombination of photogenerated carriers, such as doping,5,6 nanostructuring,7,8 surface modification,9 and formation of heterojunctions by coupling with other semiconductor or metal nanostructures.10–13
Among these strategies, the construction of suitable nanojunctions has drawn intense interest due to their significant advantages in expanding the utilization of visible light and promoting the separation of excitons to maintain the reduction and oxidation reactions at different counterparts.14,15 In the past few decades, substantial effort has been made to develop integrated material systems, including binary, ternary and multiple heterostructures, to overcome the drawbacks of the existing single photocatalytic materials.16 To date, a variety of binary systems including semiconductor junctions (e.g., Bi2WO6/TiO2,17 BiFeO3/TiO2,18 Cu2O/BiVO4,19 C3N4/MoS2,20 C3N4/NiO,21 CdS/WS2,22 and AgCl/Ag3PO423), semiconductor-metal heterojunctions (e.g., Ag3PO4/Ag,24 AgCl/Ag,25 Ag2S/Ag,26 Fe2O3/Au,27 CdSe/Au,28 and TiO2/Cu–Ni29), and semiconductor–carbon heterojunctions (e.g., TiO2/graphene,30 TiO2/carbon-nanotube,31 Bi2WO6/graphene,32 CdS/porous carbon,33 and ZnS/carbon34) have been reported and exhibited enhanced photocatalytic performance compared to a single-component photocatalyst. Moreover, multicomponent heterojunction systems in which three or more visible-light active components are spatially integrated can enable efficient channeling of the photogenerated charge carriers for the desired redox chemistry, leading to improved photocatalytic performance compared to single- or two-component systems. Typical examples are CdS/C3N4/CuS,35 TiO2/Ag/AgBr,36 TiO2/MoS2/graphene,37 In2O3/TiO2/Pt,38 Pt/n-Si/Ag,39 ZnO/ZnS/Ag2S,40 AgBr/Ag/Bi2WO6,41 V2O5/BiVO4/TiO2,42 and lanthanide-doped NaYF4/TiO2/Au.43 In particular, an all-solid-state Z-scheme system consisting of two different semiconductors with a solid electron mediator at their interface is regarded as the most promising photocatalytic system.44,45 In recent years, a great number of three component Z-scheme systems have been reported, such as CdS/Au/TiO2,46 Ag3PO4/Ag/SiC,47 and Fe2V4O13/RGO/CdS.48 Although many ternary-component photocatalysts have been reported, very few studies related to more complex heterojunctions are available in the reported studies.49–51 Therefore, the rational design of multi-heterostructure photocatalysts is anticipated to further improve the photocatalytic reaction efficiency.
In this work, an ingenious quaternary ZnO@ZnS/Ag@Ag2S nanojunction photocatalyst was successfully fabricated using a sequential photodeposition and anion-exchange reaction method. The obtained multi-nanocomposite can substantially extend light absorption to the visible region and improve the separation of photoinduced electron–hole pairs by multistep transfer, leading to enhanced photocatalytic performance. In addition, the hybrid material maintained relatively good photocatalytic activity after four cycles of H2 evolution experiments. Finally, a detailed mechanism was proposed to account for the enhanced photocatalytic activity of the ZnO@ZnS/Ag@Ag2S nanocomposite with respect to the energy band structures of the components.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Synthesis of ZnO/Ag (Z–A) composite nanowires
The ZnO nanowires were supplied by Nanjing Xianfeng Nanomaterial Technology Co. Ltd. The photoreduction method was used to prepare the ZnO/Ag (Z–A) sample. Briefly, 25 mg of ZnO nanowire powder was dispersed in 50 mL of distilled water. After that, AgNO3 solution (5 mL, 0.1 M) was added into the suspension and stirred for 30 min. The resulting mixture was exposed to UV-Vis light irradiation (300 W Xe lamp) for 1 min. The final products were collected by centrifugation, washed several times with distilled water, and then dried in air at 60 °C.
2.2 Synthesis of ZnO@ZnS (Z2) core–shell nanowires
In a typical process, 25 mg of ZnO nanowire powders was dispersed in 50 mL of a Na2S (0.4 M) solution and stirred in a 60 °C water bath for 10 h. The final products were collected by centrifugation, washed several times with distilled water, and then dried in air at 60 °C.
2.3 Synthesis of ZnO@ZnS/Ag@Ag2S (Z2–A2) nanojunctions
Typically, 25 mg of the as-prepared Z–A powder sample was dispersed in 50 mL of a Na2S (0.4 M) solution and stirred in a 60 °C water bath for 10 h. The final products were collected by centrifugation, washed several times with distilled water, and then dried in air at 60 °C.
2.4 Characterization
X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) was performed on a Rigaku SmartLab X-ray diffractometer equipped with graphite monochromatized Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.154 nm) operated at 45 kV. Characterization of sample morphology was conducted on a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, Zeiss Merlin). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images were obtained by electron microscopy (FEI Talos F200X). X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were recorded using an ESCALAB 250 Xi spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) fitted with an Al Kα radiation source. UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) were recorded using a UV-Vis spectrometer (Shimadzu, UV-2600) equipped with an integrating sphere attachment. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu RF-5301pc fluorescence spectrophotometer using a Xe lamp as the excitation source. Time-resolved photoluminescence spectra (TRPL) were recorded using a fluorescence spectrometer (FLSP920, Edinburgh Instruments).
2.5 Evaluation of photocatalytic H2 evolution
Photocatalytic H2 production reactions were carried out in a Pyrex reaction cell connected to a closed gas circulation system (Labsolar-6A, Beijing Perfectlight Co. Ltd). Typically, 20 mg of the powder photocatalyst was suspended in aqueous solution (120 mL) containing 25% by volume methanol as a sacrificial reagent. The suspension was then degassed and irradiated by using a Xe lamp (300 W, PLS-SXE300, Beijing Perfectlight Co. Ltd). The quantity of H2 was determined using a gas chromatograph (Techcomp GC-7900).
3. Results and discussion
The method used for the synthesis of the ZnO@ZnS/Ag@Ag2S (Z2–A2) nanocomposite is schematically illustrated in Fig. 1. First, monodisperse Ag nanoparticles were anchored on the surface of ZnO nanowires to form Z–A through a photoreduction process. Second, an anion-exchange sulfuration reaction was conducted to simultaneously form core/shell structured Z2–A2 heterojunctions in a single step. For comparison, ZnO@ZnS (Z2) core/shell nanowires were also synthesized. The crystallographic structures of the resultant samples were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), as shown in Fig. 2. The diffraction peaks of the pristine ZnO nanowires can be well indexed to hexagonal wurtzite-type ZnO (JCPDS no. 79-0206). For the Z–A sample prepared by photoreduction, a peak centered at 38.1° corresponding to the (111) plane of Ag (JCPDS no. 04-4387) appeared besides those of ZnO nanowires. The Z2 sample also shows additional diffraction peaks at 28.5°, 33.0° and 47.5°, which can be ascribed to the (111), (200) and (220) crystal planes of ZnS (JCPDS no. 77-2100). As expected, the Z2–A2 sample exhibits diffraction peaks corresponding to ZnO, ZnS, Ag and Ag2S without other impurities, suggesting the formation of these four-components in the composite by the present synthetic route.

Typical TEM characterization for the bare ZnO nanowires and Z–A precursors is presented in Fig. S1.† The ZnO nanowires are highly uniform with diameters in the range of 60–150 nm (Fig. S1a†). The HRTEM image (Fig. S1b†) clearly shows well-resolved lattice fringes with a spacing of 0.26 nm, corresponding to the (002) plane of ZnO, confirming the single crystalline nature of the nanowires. The TEM image of the Z–A sample demonstrates that Ag nanoparticles with sizes from approximately 8 to 16 nm were deposited on the surface of ZnO nanowires (Fig. S1c†). The lattice fringe spacings of typical Ag nanoparticles (Fig. S1d†) were measured as 0.23 nm and 0.20 nm, corresponding to the (111) and (002) planes of Ag, respectively. Fig. S2† shows the TEM and HRTEM images of sample Z2. After the sulfuration reaction, a polycrystalline ZnS shell layer was formed on the ZnO nanowire core (Fig. S2a and S2b†), and the thickness of the sulphide layer is approximately 30–40 nm. In addition, the high-angle dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) (Fig. S2c†) and the corresponding elemental mapping images (Fig. S2d–f†) demonstrate a homogeneous distribution of Zn, O, and S elements in the core/shell structured Z2 sample.
The morphology and local crystal structure of the quaternary nanojunctions were characterized by SEM and TEM. As illustrated in Fig. 3a (SEM) and b (TEM), the Z2–A2 sample has a rough surface layer on ZnO nanowires after the sulfuration treatment, suggesting the formation of core/shell structured ZnO@ZnS nanowires, similar to the Z2 sample. Moreover, we can clearly see from the magnified TEM image (Fig. 3c) that Ag@Ag2S core/shell structures have grown on the wires. The thickness of the ZnS shell layer and Ag2S shell on the surface of Ag nanoparticles is about 30–40 nm and several nanometers, respectively. The HRTEM images clearly demonstrate the formation of ZnO/ZnS (Fig. 3d, zone 1), Ag/Ag2S (Fig. 3e, zone 2), and Ag/ZnS (Fig. 3f, zone 3) interfaces in the Z2–A2 heterostructure. Obviously, Ag nanoparticles are tightly attached with the ZnO nanowire core. The lattice fringes of 0.231, 0.295, 0.313 and 0.261 nm can be assigned to the Ag (111), Ag2S (110), ZnS (111) and ZnO (002) planes, respectively. Furthermore, detailed information on the local atomic composition of the quaternary heterogeneous structure was acquired using high-angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) imaging. The element mapping images display a homogeneous distribution of O (Fig. 3h) and Zn (Fig. 3i) in the core region, while Ag (Fig. 3j) and S (Fig. 3k) elements are located in the shell region of the Z2–A2 composite. The EDX profile (Fig. 3l) also proves the coexistence of Zn, O, S and Ag elements. These results clearly prove the simultaneous formation of ZnO@ZnS and Ag@Ag2S core/shell structures in the quaternary Z2–A2 nanojunctions.

The chemical states of the Z2–A2 sample were determined using XPS. The survey scan spectrum (Fig. 4a) confirms the existence of Zn, S, O and Ag elements in the sample. As shown in Fig. 4b, binding energies of 1023.6 and 1046.6 eV are indicative of the Zn 2p3/2 and Zn 2p1/2 peaks of ZnO,52 while the peaks at 1021.6 and 1044.5 eV are ascribed to the Zn 2p3/2 and Zn 2p1/2 peaks of ZnS, respectively.53 In the high resolution Ag 3d XPS spectrum (Fig. 4c), the peaks at 367.8 and 373.8 eV can be attributed to those of the Ag 3d5/2 and Ag 3d3/2 peaks of Ag+ ions in the Ag2S nanoparticles.54 The other peaks at 368.2 and 374.1 eV in the Ag 3d spectrum are assigned to the Ag 3d5/2 and Ag 3d3/2 peaks of metallic Ag, respectively.54 The core level of the S 2p spectrum is shown in Fig. 4d, where the two peaks at 161.5 and 162.7 eV belong to the S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2 peaks, respectively.55 These results clearly demonstrate the existence of Ag and Ag2S, which is in good agreement with the XRD and TEM analysis discussed above.

UV-Vis diffuse reflectance absorption spectra (DRS) were measured to investigate the photoabsorption properties of all the samples (Fig. 5). The absorption edge of pristine ZnO nanowires is located at 387 nm, corresponding to the intrinsic absorption of ZnO with a band gap of 3.20 eV. The presence of Ag nanoparticles on ZnO nanowires in the Z–A sample leads to the increase of the absorption intensity in the visible light region between 400 and 600 nm, owing to the Ag surface plasmon band.56 In addition, a slight spectral redshift (from 387 to 395 nm) occurs due to the leakage of excitons from the ZnO core to the ZnS shell. Similar results were observed in previous reports.57,58 Obviously, the Z2–A2 quaternary composites exhibit a broader absorption range in the visible light region than the other three samples. The enhanced absorption intensity from ∼500 nm to the NIR region should be attributed to the formation of Ag2S with a small band gap of ∼1.1 eV.59,60

The photocatalytic hydrogen evolution abilities of all the samples were examined under UV-Vis light (xenon lamp, 300 W) irradiation. As shown in Fig. 6a, pristine ZnO nanowires display a weak photocatalytic activity for H2 production evolution of 30.8 μmol g−1 in 5 h. After forming a ZnS shell on the surface of the ZnO nanowires, the hydrogen yields drastically increased to 92.8 μmol g−1. This result is consistent with previous reports.61 The rough ZnS shell would result in a large specific surface area, which provides more active sites for the photocatalytic reaction.62,63 The deposition of Ag nanoparticles on the ZnO nanowires can also improve the hydrogen yields (45.1 μmol g−1). Interestingly, the Z2–A2 sample shows the highest photocatalytic activity among all samples, with a H2 production rate of 140.3 μmol g−1, approximately 1.5 and 3.1 times greater than that of Z2 and Z–A samples, respectively. The enhanced activity should be attributed to the efficient light harvesting and charge separation at the multijunction interfaces.64,65 Compared with reported studies related to junctions consisting of ZnS, Ag2S or Ag,65,66 the photocatalytic properties in the present work are slightly lower, which might be owing to the use of different sacrificial agents. In addition, it should be noted that both stability and high activity are indispensable for a photocatalyst to be commercially viable.67 Recycling experiments were carried out to evaluate the photostability of the Z2–A2 composite under light illumination. As shown in Fig. 6b, after four cycles of consecutive recycling, the photocatalytic performance declined slightly by 6.6%, which should be due to the photocorrosion of ZnO under irradiation.

To further understand the charge transfer and recombination behavior of the hybrid photocatalytic materials, room temperature photoluminescence (PL) measurements were carried out. Fig. 7a shows the steady state PL spectra of all the samples collected with an excitation wavelength of 325 nm. It is noteworthy that the PL intensity for the Z2–A2 sample was greatly suppressed compared to the other samples, indicating a low recombination rate of e−/h+ pairs in the quaternary composite. Moreover, time-resolved photoluminescence spectra (TRPL) measurements were also conducted, as shown in Fig. 7b. All the decay curves of hybrid materials (Z–A, Z2 and Z2–A2) can be well-fitted by a bi-exponential function using the equation F(t) = B1exp(−t/τ1) + B2exp(−t/τ2), where τ1 and τ2 represent the time constants of slow and fast decay components respectively, and B1 and B2 represent the corresponding amplitudes. The average decay time was calculated using the equation τ = (B1τ12 + B2τ22)/(B1τ1 + B2τ2).68 The results are summarized in Table 1. As can be seen, all samples show two recombination paths: the fast decay and slow decay. Such long decay time on a microsecond scale is similar to previous reports.69 The Z2–A2 sample shows the longest decay time among all hybrid samples, suggesting a lower recombination rate of the photogenerated charges in the multijunction system. These results are consistent with the photocatalytic hydrogen production rates discussed above.

A possible mechanism of the Z2–A2 multijunction system is proposed on the basis of the experimental results and analyses above (Fig. 8). Both Z-scheme and type II core/shell heterojunctions are formed in the quaternary hybrid material, as illustrated in Fig. 8a, with the corresponding energy level diagram shown in Fig. 8b. A Z-scheme structure is formed by ZnO, Ag and Ag2S (the right side of Fig. 8b). Under light illumination, Ag acts as an excellent electron acceptor by accepting electrons from the conduction band (CB) of ZnO, which recombine with the photoinduced holes produced from the valence band (VB) of Ag2S. The electrons in the CB of Ag2S exhibit strong reduction ability for hydrogen production. The formation of type II heterojunctions between the ZnS and ZnO core/shell heterostructure in the Z2–A2 hybrids (left part of Fig. 8b) also contributes to the enhanced photocatalytic activity of the Z2–A2 material. When the ZnO/ZnS heterostructure is illuminated under light, the electrons in the VB of both ZnS and ZnO are excited to their CB. The photogenerated electrons within the CB of ZnS can easily move to the CB of ZnO (the CB of ZnO is more positive than that of ZnS), whereas the photogenerated holes transfer from the VB of ZnO to the VB of ZnS (the VB of ZnS lies at a more negative potential than that of ZnO), which can inhibit the recombination rate of the photogenerated carriers in the hybrid system. As a result, the unique design of the present quaternary heterostructure combines both a Z-scheme configuration and type II heterojunctions, which favor the spatial separation and multistep transportation of photogenerated e−/h+ pairs, resulting in enhanced photocatalytic water splitting activity.

4. Conclusions
In summary, we have designed and synthesized a novel ZnO@ZnS/Ag@Ag2S quaternary nanojunction photocatalyst through a photodeposition process followed by an anion-exchange reaction. The rationally designed quaternary nanojunctions could effectively enhance the photocatalytic water splitting performance (4.5 times higher than that of pure ZnO nanowires) by extending the light absorption range as well as increasing the photoinduced charge separation across multiple interfaces. Interfacial Ag nanoparticles could serve as a solid electron mediator at the interface between wide-bandgap ZnO and narrow-bandgap Ag2S to build a Z-scheme structure. Meanwhile, the type II ZnO/ZnS core/shell structures were also formed. The synergetic effects of these complex multiple heterojunctions contribute to significantly enhanced photocatalytic activity. This work provides an optimized model for constructing new quaternary nanojunction photocatalysts with high-efficiency hydrogen evolution.
