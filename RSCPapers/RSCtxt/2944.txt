    , Accepted 9th January 2018First published on 9th January 2018AbstractIn this study, metal–organic frameworks, as an interfacial layer, were introduced into perovskite solar cells (PSCs) for the first time. An interface modified with the metal–organic framework ZIF-8 efficiently enhanced perovskite crystallinity and grain sizes, and the photovoltaic performance of the PSCs was significantly improved, resulting in a maximum PCE of 16.99%.
Hybrid organic-lead halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted tremendous attention since 2009 when Miyasaka et al. reported for the first time that perovskite could be utilized as a light harvester in liquid-state sensitized solar cells, and the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.8% was achieved.1 Within several years, perovskites achieved unexpected and rapid progress in the field of solar cells, and the PCE of PSCs was boosted to 22.1% in 2016.2 In spite of the improvement in efficiency, one of the main challenges still encountered in the formation of perovskite film is the control of the crystallization, which has proven to be crucial for the stability and reproducibility of the cell photovoltaic performance.3 Therefore, it is highly desirable to develop an effective way for manipulating the growth and nucleation of perovskite to form an optimal film.
Recent attempts have mainly focused on two aspects that lead to high-quality perovskite films and enhanced photovoltaic performance. One aspect is solvent engineering during the process of the precursor solution deposition, which can lead to highly uniform perovskite thin films with high crystallinity.4–7 Burschka et al. showed that perovskite crystallinity could be enhanced in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) by pre-deposition of PbI2 from solution onto mesoporous TiO2 (mp-TiO2).5 Shi et al. reported a novel approach for tuning perovskite crystallization in PSCs by incorporating 4-tert-butylpyridine into the PbI2/DMF precursor solution, and the PCE of 15.01% was achieved.8 In addition, 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO),9 CH3NH3Cl,10 acetonitrile,11 and thiourea12 were utilized for adjusting the perovskite film in order to promote its crystallinity. The second approach is the introduction of interlayers onto the surface of the electron transporting layer (ETL), which is also effective for enhancing the quality of the perovskite film.13 Wang et al. prepared a multifunctional polyethyleneimine interlayer between the ETL and the perovskite layer and uniform perovskite films with a low density of defect were formed.14 Ito et al. employed a blocking layer of Sb2S3 between mp-TiO2 and the perovskite layer, which could improve the light stability of devices and reduce the surface oxygen vacancies of mp-TiO2.15 Additionally, plasmonic Au nanoparticles,16 Au@SiO2,17 and MgO18 could serve as interfacial layers to reduce the hysteresis and improve the stability of the PSCs. However, most of the materials mentioned above cannot be synthesized easily, with the exception of Sb2S3. Therefore, exploring an interlayer material with an environmentally friendly and facile synthesis for improving perovskite crystallinity and photovoltaic performance is imperative for the long-term operation of PSCs.
Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) are a class of three-dimensional porous crystalline materials constructed of organic linkers and metal-based nodes.19,20 Typically, ZIF-8 is a MOF that is chemically robust and thermally stable. Fig. S1a (ESI†) depicts its chemical structure. More importantly, ZIF-8 can be grown on many kinds of substrates such as glass slides, silicon wafers,21 porous titania,22 and α-alumina.23 In our previous study, ZIF-8 was first introduced into DSSCs for modifying the surface of a TiO2 electrode and we found that the open-circuit voltage could be significantly increased.24 To the best of our knowledge, however, the works by Vinogradov et al.25 and Ho et al.26 are the only reports dealing with MOF materials in PSCs.
In the present work, a thin interlayer of ZIF-8 was coated on the surface of mp-TiO2 in a PSC system in order to control the growth of a perovskite crystal layer, and we found that the photovoltaic performance could be enhanced obviously. Furthermore, the relationships between the incorporation of the ZIF-8 interlayer and the photovoltaic performance were investigated in detail.
The chemical structure of ZIF-8 and the configuration of the PSC with a ZIF-8 interlayer are shown in Fig. S1a and b (ESI†). The most standard architecture for a PSC comprises a compact TiO2 layer and a mp-TiO2 layer, which act as the blocking and scaffold layers for transporting the electron, while spiro-OMeTAD is used as the hole-transporting layer (HTL), and the CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) hybrid organic–inorganic halide perovskite is utilized as a light-harvesting layer. In the present work, this configuration was modified by incorporating a ZIF-8 interlayer between the mp-TiO2 and the perovskite layer. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the ZIF-8 powder collected from the solution is shown in Fig. 1a. It clearly shows that the main diffraction peaks agree well with the standard values, demonstrating that ZIF-8 was successfully synthesized. It is also found from Fig. 1b that there is no obvious change of morphology of the mp-TiO2 layer after the deposition of the ZIF-8 layer for 40 min. Moreover, the SEM images showing different ZIF-8 deposition times on mp-TiO2 are shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). According to the XPS spectra of mp-TiO2/ZIF-8-0, mp-TiO2/ZIF-8-20 and mp-TiO2/ZIF-8-40, shown in Fig. 1c, there is a steady increase of Zn2+ content with increasing ZIF-8 coating time, indicating that the growth thickness of ZIF-8 can be controlled by the deposition time. To investigate the surface modification of the mp-TiO2 layer coated by ZIF-8, atomic force microscopy (AFM) was employed. As depicted in Fig. S3 (ESI†), the ZIF-8 interface modification impacted on the roughness of the mp-TiO2 film. The mp-TiO2 film without a ZIF-8 coating layer presents a root-mean-square surface roughness (RMS) of around 19.6 nm (Fig. S3a, ESI†), which is increased to 20.2 and 20.8 nm after coating with ZIF-8 for 10 and 20 min (Fig. S3b and c, ESI†), respectively. In addition, when the coating time is increased to 40 min, the RMS value is increased to 23.3 nm (Fig. S3d, ESI†), indicating that the deposition amount of ZIF-8 on the surface of mp-TiO2 is further increasing and the mp-TiO2 film is becoming rougher.

Fig. 2 displays the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of MAPbI3 prepared on the mp-TiO2 film with and without ZIF-8 coating layers. It can be found from Fig. 2 that these perovskite films fully cover the surface without pin-holes, and the morphology is polyhedral-like, but the grain size differs obviously when tuning the ZIF-8 coating time on the surface of the mp-TiO2. In particular, the grain sizes of the mp-TiO2/ZIF-8-20 (Fig. 2c) based perovskite film are found to be ca. 3–4 times larger than those of the mp-TiO2/ZIF-8-0 (Fig. 2a) and mp-TiO2/ZIF-8-10 (Fig. 2b) based films. Moreover, the roughness of the perovskite film based on mp-TiO2/ZIF-8-20 (RMS = 33.1 nm) (Fig. S4a, ESI†) is reduced compared to that of the film based on mp-TiO2/ZIF-8-10 (RMS = 35.8 nm) (Fig. S4b, ESI†). The increased grain size and smoother perovskite film imply that the introduction of a ZIF-8 interlayer not only preserves the morphology of the pristine film but also essentially modifies the crystallization dynamics. Simultaneously, the increased grain sizes and the reduced grain boundaries based on the ZIF-8 coating layer can improve the quality of the perovskite film. However, an irregular morphology of perovskite film is observed when the coating time of ZIF-8 is prolonged to 40 min, implying that an mp-TiO2 substrate surface that is too rough might hamper the growth of the deposited perovskite film. As we know, the development of crystals is controlled by the primary nucleation and the following growth. Hence, competition between nucleation and growth can lead to dramatically different perovskite films, and the best quality of perovskite film can be obtained only at an optimum RMS of the ZIF-8/mp-TiO2 layer. Fig. S5 (ESI†) shows the XRD patterns of mp-TiO2/ZIF-8-x based perovskite films created by varying the coating time. Firstly, a change of crystal phases cannot be observed in the perovskite polycrystalline thin films. Regardless of the different ZIF-8 coating times, all the films preserve the tetragonal phase, and the main characteristic peaks located at 14.10°, 28.44° and 31.91° correspond to the (110), (220) and (310) planes of MAPbI3, and are consistent with reported results.5 Furthermore, with the increase of ZIF-8 coating time on the surface of mp-TiO2 from 0 to 20 min, the crystallinity of the perovskite is improved significantly; this can be ascribed to the increase of the perovskite grain sizes. However, when the coating time of ZIF-8 is increased to 40 min, the crystallinity of the perovskite decreases; this might be caused by the ZIF-8 film becoming too thick and the relatively rough mp-TiO2 film substrate that is probably detrimental to the crystallinity of the perovskite. To speculate about the reason for the enhanced grain size and the improved crystallinity of perovskite caused by the ZIF-8 layer on the surface of mp-TiO2, a possible model for the interaction between the ZIF-8 layer and the perovskite film is illustrated in Fig. 3.

 Fig. 3  Schematic illustration of two neighbouring grain structures crosslinked by methyl groups of ZIF-8. 
When the ZIF-8 layer is incorporated into the surface of the mp-TiO2 film, it might act as an additional scaffold to allow the growth of crystals inside perovskite. This is similar to the report that an additional scaffold could support an ordered arrangement of perovskite crystallites at the initial stage of crystallization.26 Furthermore, the methyl groups in the crystal structure of ZIF-8 might also form hydrogen bonds with the halide anions of the perovskite,27 so enhancing the cohesion of the perovskite film with the substrate. Thus, the optimal amount of ZIF-8 could crosslink neighbouring perovskite grains effectively, leading to the increased grain size and the smooth morphology of the perovskite, and finally forming a high quality capping light-harvesting layer on the surface of the mp-TiO2 film. However, an over-large RMS is detrimental to the crystallinity of perovskite,28,29 and so a ZIF-8 layer that is too thick is unfavorable for the formation of a smooth perovskite film.
A cross-sectional SEM image of the full device is shown in Fig. 4a, which reveals its uniform architecture. The thickness of the mp-TiO2 and perovskite capping layer is about 450 nm, and, as is expected, the CH3NH3PbI3 has been successfully infiltrated into the pores of the mp-TiO2 film. Thus, the thickness of the photo-active film is enough to gain a relatively high Jsc value. To further investigate the effects of the ZIF-8 coating layer on PSC performance, cells without and with ZIF-8 coating layers were fabricated. The photovoltaic properties are characterized by current density–voltage (J–V) measurements under simulated one sun illumination (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2) in air with the active area of 0.12 cm2. The typical J–V curves are shown in Fig. 4b, and the statistics are listed in Table S1 (ESI†). The best PCE for the PSC with pure mp-TiO2 as the ETL is 14.75% (Jsc of 20.77 mA cm−2, Voc of 1.00 V, FF of 0.71) from a reverse scan. By contrast, the PSC with the ZIF-8-20 interface modification obtains a better efficiency of 16.99% (Jsc of 22.82 mA cm−2, Voc of 1.02 V, FF of 0.73), which is much better than that of the control cell without the ZIF-8 coating layer. Notably, the cell composed of mp-TiO2/ZIF-8-20 shows significantly improved Jsc and FF values, while a comparable Voc value, compared to the pristine cell. The improved photovoltaic parameters might be attributed to the increased grain size of perovskite and thereby the better crystallinity and higher quality of the perovskite film that enhance the extraction of the charge carriers from the active layer. According to the results above, the optimal time for ZIF-8 growth on the surface of mp-TiO2 is 20 min, and this results in an enhanced crystallinity of perovskite, smoother photo-active film and improved performance of the PSCs. However, an obvious hysteresis during a forward scan is also observed for the devices with ZIF-8-x as the interlayer (Fig. S6 and Table S2 (ESI†)). Such a significant hysteresis is mainly due to the lower Jsc values compared to those obtained from reverse scans and it is probably due to the poor electrical conductivity of the ZIF-8 material; this may cause an unbalanced charge transportation or extraction which leads to the lower Jsc values from the forward scanning direction.14
 Fig. 4  (a) The cross-sectional SEM image of the photovoltaic device, (b) J–V curves for PSCs employing ETLs comprising mp-TiO2 coated with ZIF-8 for different times. The J–V curves were measured from the forward bias to short circuit condition at the scan rate of 20 mV s−1 under AM1.5 simulated solar light (100 mW cm−2) illumination. 
In order to further illustrate the trend mentioned above, the incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the PSCs employing mp-TiO2 coated with ZIF-8 for different times as the ETLs, and the PSC without a ZIF-8 layer as a reference device, are shown in Fig. S7a (ESI†). The PSC with the mp-TiO2/ZIF-8-20 film as the ETL showed an enhanced IPCE value compared to that of mp-TiO2/ZIF-8-0 in the wavelength range of 350–750 nm, which is consistent with the increased Jsc value. The integration of the IPCE spectrum (Fig. S7b, ESI†) for the cell (Jsc of 22.65 mA cm−2, Voc of 1.01 V, FF of 0.72, PCE of 16.47%) gave a current density of 21.78 mA cm−2, which is almost the same as that measured using the solar simulator, indicating the coherent photovoltaic behaviors of the PSCs. Additionally, a histogram of the PCEs measured from 30 cells with and without ZIF-8 coating layers at the interfaces is shown in Fig. S7c (ESI†). The devices exhibit superior performance and reproducibility for the cells coated with ZIF-8 layers on the surface of the mp-TiO2 films.
To further elucidate the effects of the ZIF-8 coating layer at the interface, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were applied to evaluate the internal electrical properties. Fig. S8 (ESI†) shows the Nyquist plots of PSCs measured at a bias of −0.7 V under dark conditions, and the corresponding parameters are listed in Table S3 (ESI†). The equivalent circuit shown in the inset of Fig. S8 (ESI†) includes a series resistance (Rs), a transmission resistance (Rct) and a recombination resistance (Rrec). The results reveal that when the ZIF-8 was coated on mp-TiO2 for 20 min, the Rct extracted from fitting the EIS spectra decreased from 336 to 262 Ω, and meanwhile the Rrec increased from 4286 to 4810 Ω, suggesting that the PSC based on mp-TiO2/ZIF-8-20 has a superior charge transfer efficiency and a lower recombination rate compared to that of the pristine mp-TiO2 based cell. It is speculated that the reduced recombination rate is caused by the perovskite film with larger grain size, leading to a reduced grain boundary and longer carrier lifetime. Steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) measurements were employed to investigate the charge extraction efficiency of the PSCs. As presented in Fig. S9a (ESI†), the addition of ZIF-8 at the interface produced a strong quenching of the perovskite PL. The degree of the PL intensity reduction is closely related to the more efficient charge extraction. PL quenching after ZIF-8 modification of the mp-TiO2 can be explained by an increased efficiency of electron injection at the perovskite-mp-TiO2 contact. Furthermore, to evaluate the exciton lifetime of perovskite on the mp-TiO2 ETL with and without a ZIF-8 coating layer, time constants τe were obtained by fitting time-resolved PL (TRPL) curves (Fig. S9b, ESI†). As a result, the time constants τe of perovskite film, mp-TiO2/perovskite and mp-TiO2/ZIF-8-20/perovskite were calculated to be 10.95, 2.74 and 1.17 ns, respectively. Thus, the PL decay after ZIF-8-20 modification at the interface is faster by approximately 57%, suggesting that the time needed for electron injection from the perovskite film to mp-TiO2/ZIF-8-20 is shorter than that to the pristine TiO2. The more efficient electron injection is possibly due to the better crystallinity of the perovskite film and the higher quality of the active film which contribute to more efficient photo-generated carrier extraction at the interface between mp-TiO2 and perovskite, and finally result in the improved performance.
In summary, the effects of modifying mp-TiO2 film with a ZIF-8 layer on the crystallization of the hybrid perovskite and the photovoltaic properties of PSCs were investigated for the first time. The results indicate that a significant enhancement in the crystallinity and morphology of the perovskite thin film was achieved via coating with a ZIF-8 layer at the interface between mp-TiO2 and the perovskite film. Under the optimal conditions, the cell coated with ZIF-8 for 20 min on the surface of mp-TiO2 showed a PCE of 16.99%, which was higher than that of the reference cell without the ZIF-8 coating layer. These results illustrate that the interface between mp-TiO2/ZIF-8 and the perovskite film plays an important role which can efficiently suppress the recombination of photo-generated carriers and improve charge extraction. This work provides useful information for the effective application of ZIF-8 perovskite solar cells.
