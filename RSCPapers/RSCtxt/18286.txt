    , Accepted 7th January 2021First published on 7th January 2021AbstractCarbon nitride (CNx) is an emerging photocatalyst with the potential to efficiently produce solar fuels. CNx heterojunctions often show significant photocatalytic activity improvements. We review the charge carrier dynamics in a range of CNx heterojunctions including carbon-based material, black phosphorus, Ru complexes, molybdenum sulphide and metal phosphides. Time resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) and transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) were the most common techniques employed for experimental charge carrier dynamics measurements. The low photoluminescence quantum yield of CNx appeared to limit the depth of conclusions from TRPL, with both lengthening and shortening of the TRPL lifetimes observed and attributed to enhanced charge separation. Overall, the charge carrier dynamics studies often showed a relative lifetime change of ∼2-fold and an activity improvement of >10-fold. We highlight the need for the use of a wider range of techniques to monitor the charge carrier dynamics for conclusive determination of photophysics–activity relationships and elucidation of improvement mechanisms.

Robert Godin
Robert Godin born in Bathurst, New Brunswick, Canada, Robert has been interested in photochemistry since the start of his higher education. After learning a breath of photochemistry and spectroscopy techniques working with Prof. Tito Scaiano (BSc, University of Ottawa) and Prof. Gonzalo Cosa (PhD, McGill University), Robert completed a postdoctoral stint with Prof. James Durrant at Imperial College London and entered the field of solar energy conversion. In 2018, he established his independent group at UBC in Kelowna. The group develops time-resolved spectroscopic tools to better understand carbon-based semiconductors for sustainable energy production, with a healthy dose of physical organic chemistry concepts.
Introduction
Spurred by growing climate crisis concerns, different strategies are being developed to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and accelerate a transition to a low-carbon economy. The immense potential of solar power is too great to overlook and it will surely play an important role in future sustainable energy supply.1 Photovoltaic (PV) is by far the dominant solar energy conversion technology currently deployed.2 However, the increased share of PV on the electrical grid produces significant load management challenges.3 Without a scalable energy storage strategy, the effectiveness of PV is compromised by the mismatch in sunlight availability and energy demands.4
Taking inspiration from natural photosynthesis, we can store solar energy in high-density chemical bonds, generating high energy molecules termed ‘solar fuels’.5 A prominent artificial photosynthesis example is hydrogen generated from photocatalytic water splitting. Sunlight is absorbed by a photocatalyst and drives the conversion of water into oxygen and hydrogen (H2) fuel. Another attractive approach is the photochemical reduction of CO2 into liquid fuels (e.g. methanol) that can be incorporated within existing fossil fuel-based energy infrastructure. Photocatalytic systems are also of interest for air and water purification mainly through advanced oxidation processes.6,7
Looking toward widespread implementation, ongoing efforts are targeting photocatalytic materials made from Earth abundant elements such as carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and first row/early transition metals.9–15 In 2009, a seminal report of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution from an organic polymer, carbon nitride (CNx; see Fig. 1),16 made it clear that organic semiconductors were highly promising photocatalytic materials and CNx is still considered a leading candidate today.9,14 In addition to being made from Earth abundant elements, the CNx precursors (e.g. urea, melamine, cyanamide) are inexpensive and CNx has appropriate chemical and light stability.17 We present melon as the model CNx structure in Fig. 1 but note that a wide range of chemical defects and branching should be considered.18 It has been shown that the idealized 2D polymerized ‘graphitic’ carbon nitride is inconsistent with thorough NMR characterization and the significant H atom% content of the CNx powder and rather point to melon.8,9
 Fig. 1  The top panel shows the structure of carbon nitride, CNx, in the most relevant melon structure.8 The bottom panel shows the Kubelka–Munk transform of CNx diffuse reflectance spectra (left axis, red solid line) and the photoluminescence spectra of CNx (right axis, blue dashed line). 
Water splitting involves two coupled redox reactions, hydrogen reduction and water oxidation. Often sacrificial reagents such as triethanolamine or methanol are used as hole scavengers to overcome the kinetic challenge of water oxidation. Fast extraction of holes by a sacrificial reagent has a beneficial effect on photocatalytic hydrogen evolution through suppressed recombination. The apparent quantum yield (AQY) for photocatalytic hydrogen production from sacrificial reagents has surpassed 50%,19,20 yet the efficiency of photosynthetic water splitting, without any sacrificial reagents, is at most a few percent.21–24 Efficiency improvement are still needed for commercially-viable exploitation.
The effectiveness of a photocatalyst will depend on many optoelectronic material properties: the positions of the conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB), the light harvesting capacity, the charge mobility, the density of catalytically active surface sites and their reactivity, and the (photo)chemical stability. The breadth of properties and their interrelation create an imposing optimization challenge. To alleviate these restrictions, a promising method is to form a junction between different materials to isolate their function or enhance material properties.25–29 As a typical example, take a strongly light absorbing photocatalyst that suffers from poor surface reactivity. Forming a junction with a second material that possesses high catalytic activity, but may suffer from poor light harvesting, can significantly increase the overall photocatalytic efficiency. Heterojunctions refer to when different materials are brought together. Although rarer, homojunctions between the same material that differ in e.g. doping,30 morphology,31 or crystallinity32 have also been shown to improve photocatalytic activity.
CNx is limited by its light absorption, fast charge recombination, low charge carrier mobility and overall poor photocatalytic activity.33–35 There is a rapidly growing body of literature on the modifications of CNx and their effect on the photocatalytic activity.17,36,37 CNx heterojunctions have been formed with a wide range of materials, such as metal oxides, metal chalcogenides, carbon nanostructures, and molecular species. The choice of materials to place in junction with CNx is usually made to overcome one or many of the limitations of the individual materials. As detailed below, the charge carrier lifetime can be lengthened in a system with appropriate energy level offsets that drive electrons and holes in opposite directions. Cocatalysts are often chosen for this role and to accelerate surface redox reactions. Semiconductors with more absorption in the visible range are also common junction partners to CNx to improve light harvesting. There is a strong push for increased efficiencies and most, if not all, publications report at least one CNx heterojunction that results in improved photocatalytic activity. Our fundamental understanding is more limited and few clear design guidelines have emerged. Elucidating the charge carrier dynamics is necessary to understand the improved catalytic activity to refine photocatalyst designs. To help direct future CNx heterojunction development, we undertook a review of the field of the charge carrier dynamics in CNx heterojunctions. Grouped by measurement technique and material composition, we summarize the reported charge carrier dynamics and highlight emerging trends or inconsistencies between different reports.
Charge carrier dynamics
Underpinning any photocatalytic process is the kinetic competition between productive and unproductive steps. Photoexcitation of a semiconductor initially generates a Coulomb-bound electron–hole pair. The solar energy conversion efficiency is determined by the combined efficiencies of each subsequent step: (1) charge separation, (2) charge transport, (3) surface redox reaction (Fig. 2). The efficiency of each step is determined by the kinetic competition of productive processes vs. the energy wasting electron–hole charge recombination that restores the initial ground state. Collectively, the pathways taken by charges and their kinetics are referred to as the charge carrier dynamics. Determining the timescales of different photophysical processes and the resulting kinetic competition provides key insights into limitations and identification of the root cause of improvements.
 Fig. 2  Kinetic competitions in the steps of charge separation, charge transport and surface redox reactions. The initial exciton is represented by the dashed oval and separates into a free electron and hole. The rates (R) of the different processes are indicated and will dictate the yield of each step. Abbreviations: CB is conduction band, VB is valence band, CS is charge separation, rec is recombination, trans is transport, red is reduction, ox is oxidation, rxn is reaction. 
Lengthening the charge carrier lifetimes is crucial to achieve efficient performance. Charge recombination can be as short as picoseconds in photoexcited semiconductor systems. The artificial photosynthetic reactions typical of solar energy conversion are complex multi-electron, multi-proton processes. This results in relatively slow rates, in the range of microseconds (e.g. proton reduction) to seconds (e.g. water oxidation).38–45 Significant improvements in charge carrier lifetimes are necessary for device function. A proven approach to enhance photocatalytic efficiency is the formation of a junction to improve the charge carrier dynamics of the system. Improved efficiency of photocatalytic junctions relies heavily on charge transfer across the interface(s) (Fig. 3). An energy offset and/or band bending near an interface can improve charge separation and increase the yield of charges. Segregating electrons and holes in different materials also can dramatically reduce the rate of the distance-dependant charge recombination and increase charge carrier lifetimes. Adding a material to enhance light absorption or catalytic reactivity normally requires charges to cross the interface and connect the two materials.

(B) CNx in junction with a non-light absorbing cocatalyst. (C) CNx in junction with a semiconductor which absorbs at longer wavelengths. The direction of the charge transfer would be dependent on the band alignment and electric fields at the interface. (D) Like (C) but here electrons and holes from the two different materials recombine near the interface to give a Z-scheme. 
At a first approximation, we can look at the band edge energies of the isolated materials to predict the flow of charges in the heterojunction (Fig. 4). In the typical energy scale representation (vacuum toward the top), to minimize their energy electrons will occupy the lowest CB and holes will occupy the highest VB. The band gaps of two materials can be straddling (Type I), staggered (Type II) or completely separated, also called broken gap (Type III). Type II alignment is the most promising for improving photocatalytic function as there is significant driving force for charge separation in different materials.46 For a complete description of a heterointerface, more subtle effects such as interfacial reconstruction and chemical interactions need to be considered.45–47

Charge carrier dynamics can be monitored by a variety of optical or electrical methods.47 Many optical methods rely on the time-resolved detection of a probe beam. The techniques are distinguished by the spectral range of the probe beam: UV-Vis transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS),48–50 time-resolved infrared spectroscopy (TRIR),51,52 time-resolved microwave conductance (TRMC),53,54 time-resolved terahertz spectroscopy (tr-THz).55 The emission associated with radiative recombination of charges can also track the charge carrier population and is the basis of time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL).56,57 Electrical methods to monitor charge carrier dynamics include electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS),58,59 and transient photovoltage or photocurrents.60 As CNx photocatalysts are often used as heterogeneous dispersions, there are fewer examples of electrical-based charge carrier dynamics characterization. We also note that these electrical methods are often inappropriate to probe particulate systems when the operating conditions do not involve electrical connection. The (photo)electrical characterization may very well reflect the quality of the interface instead of the material properties.
TRPL instrumentation is widespread and it is the most used technique. However, the ability to only monitor the emissive species often provides an incomplete picture of the charge carriers involved in photochemical reactions. In contrast, TAS can monitor both emissive and non-emissive (i.e. trapped) species, providing more information to establish a working model of the photocatalytic system. Both TRPL and TAS have been used to determine the charge carrier dynamics in CNx heterojunctions. Other methods are much less used for these systems. Perhaps surprisingly, we were only able to find two such examples, where TRMC61 or transient open-circuit voltage decay23 was used.
Key considerations for TRPL
Recombination of electron and holes requires the excess energy to be dissipated. We can distinguish two different types of recombination based on the energy outlet: radiative recombination emits the excess energy as a photon and non-radiative recombination dissipates the energy as heat through vibrations. Band-to-band recombination is typically radiative in nature and provides the means to monitor the charge carrier dynamics from the emission.
The most common technique used to monitor TRPL is time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC).62 A short light pulse is used to excite the sample. A histogram is built of the time delay between photoexcitation and the detection of an emitted photon to represent the decay of the excited state. The time resolution is typically a few hundred picoseconds, limited by the detector transit time spread. The emission wavelength can be selected using a monochromator or appropriate filters. The photoluminescence (PL) intensity at any time t [IPL(t)] will be proportional to the rate of recombination that forms emissive species. In the simplest case of free charge carriers, the rate (Rrecom) will follow bimolecular kinetics to give: (1)krecomb is the rate constant for recombination, Δn and Δp are the densities of photogenerated electrons and holes, respectively. The PL intensity over time will thus be proportional to the time-dependent concentration of excess photogenerated charges. The PL decay will also reflect other processes, such as charge trapping and charge transfer, that decrease the density of charges that recombine radiatively and instead release heat (Fig. 5).
 Fig. 5  Energy diagram showing band-to-band carrier radiative relaxation competing with relaxation through non-radiative charge trapping. −Δ indicates the release of heat. 
TRPL decays are most often fitted to multiexponential models to extract lifetimes of different processes. This approach is sound for molecular systems which tend to have unimolecular (i.e. first order, single exponential) fluorescence pathways, although one still needs to be wary of the statistical uncertainty in distinguishing lifetime distributions that can arise from e.g. a range of environments.63,64 For semiconductor materials the decay kinetics tend to be complex. The bimolecular nature of recombination, charge trapping, dispersive transport, charge tunneling, and more can lead to non-exponential decays.65–69 Power laws are prevalent for solid materials70 and stretched exponentials are expected in certain cases.71,72 Caution should be exercised when interpreting multiexponential decays.
A significant limitation of TRPL applied to CNx that is often overlooked is the inherently low PL quantum yield (QY) of CNx. While not a straightforward measurement to make for the opaque CNx powders, PL QYs of <10% are typically reported.73–79 With examples of apparent quantum yields (AQYs) for hydrogen production exceeding 50%, it is clear that TRPL will not provide a complete description of the charges that reach catalytic sites. It seems more likely that TRPL mainly probes unreactive charges in the bulk and thus reflects the bulk material properties. It should also be noted that the conditions under which TRPL is most often measured (dry powder) puts the CNx material in a completely different environment then the operating conditions (e.g. aqueous solution). Any effects of hydrogen bonding or proton transfer are lost in the powder measurement. Measurements under operating conditions are preferable.
TRPL analysis can determine the average lifetime of emissive photoexcited electrons in the material of interest. There are instances of ambiguity in whether the amplitude-weighted or intensity-weighted lifetimes are reported. We report the preferred amplitude-weighted lifetimes (equation 2) that give a proportional measure of emissive state populations.80 (2)Here A represents the amplitude and τ is the corresponding PL lifetime. CNx heterojunctions with lengthened TRPL lifetime compared to the CNx component is understood to result from suppressed charge recombination which improves the probability of charges participating in photocatalytic reactions. In this case, the recombination across the material interface is assumed to be radiative. When the CNx heterojunction presents a shortened TRPL lifetime, it is proposed that charge transfer has been improved. It is then assumed that only the recombination within CNx is radiative. Both longer and shorter lifetimes have been suggested as an indicator of more efficient charge separation which would depend on the nature of the emissive states.
Key considerations for transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS)
TAS is firmly established as a widely applicable tool to elucidate the charge carrier dynamics in solar energy conversion systems with prominent examples in systems such as solar fuels,38 dye-sensitized solar cells,81 organic photovoltaics,48 and perovskite solar cells.82 The information on charge recombination, transfer, and separation processes that dictate the activity of photocatalysts guides us to an optimal improvement path. A transient change in absorption is produced upon photoexcitation due to the changes in electronic structure and associated electronic transitions. A wide range of timescales are accessible with TAS.47,49 Briefly, fast dynamics on the fs–ns timescale are measured by fs–TAS in a pump–probe arrangement.83 A pump monochromatic ultrafast laser pulse is used to photoexcite the sample. A broadband ultrafast laser pulse with varying time delay is used to probe the absorption of the sample with fs time resolution. On longer timescales, a continuous probe beam is used and absorption changes are measured with fast electronics down to the ns timescale.84 Typical TAS spectra in the UV-NIR spectral region show a ground state bleaching from the loss of available transitions and photoinduced absorption from new transitions to higher electronic states (Fig. 6). Emission can cause a negative change in absorbance in the PL spectral region as can scattered laser excitation. On slower timescales (μs and longer), PL artefacts can typically be adequately corrected by a measurement without the probe beam.

The colours of the arrows are linked to the colours of the spectra in (C) and (D). (C) Example of absorption spectra for the ground and excited state. (D) The difference in absorption of the traces shown in (C) separated in its photoinduced absorption (PIA) and ground state bleaching (GSB) contributions. 
A key advantage of monitoring the absorbance instead of PL emission is that both emissive and non-emissive species can be probed. This makes TAS ideally suited to monitor trapped charges whose recombination is often non-radiative. In addition, the population of excited state species is directly proportional to the signal amplitude, making data interpretation straightforward. The caution regarding the difficulties in differentiating between multiexponential and non-exponential decays made in the TRPL section remains valid for TAS. As with TRPL, measurements under operating conditions instead of on dry powders will provide the most relevant kinetic data.
Spectral signatures can be used to distinguish between e.g. excitons and separated charges. However, the uncertainty in the initial and final electronic configurations complicate the conclusive assignment to electronic transitions. Though possible, this makes TAS unreliable in determining the energetics of trapped states. Computational chemistry support is being developed to clarify assignments.85–87

Carbon-based material/CNx junctions
Metal-free heterojunction components are composed of Earth abundant elements and have unique properties important for achieving improved photocatalysis.88,89 For example, the stability accompanied with tunable optical and electronic properties make carbon-based/CNx heterojunctions advantageous photocatalysts.88,90 Investigations of organic/CNx heterojunctions for solar driven photocatalysis focusing on the dynamics of charge carriers have been limited to date. These types of studies are often challenging due to the use of ill-defined emerging materials, heterogeneous systems, and complex spectral assignments.91
Carbon dot (CD)/CNx junctions have been targeted to produce metal-free photocatalysts and have demonstrated promising photocatalytic activities.92,93 A recent example is the TAS investigation of CD/CNx junctions with two different types of CDs which revealed that the direction of charge flow inverted from one type of CD to the other.94 CDs prepared by sonication-assisted oxidation (sCD) acted as electron acceptors, providing limited improvements to the water oxidation reaction and overall photoactivity. In contrast CDs synthesized from urea and citric acid using a modified microwave method (mCD) demonstrated characteristics of a hole acceptor in the heterojunction composite. This provided a 12-fold increase in photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity in comparison to the sCD/CNx. The charge accepting behaviours were concluded from diffuse reflectance TAS that probed the charge carriers of the CNx component of the heterojunction (Fig. 7). Compared to pure CNx, the electron signal increased in mCD/CNx but decreased for sCD/CNx (Fig. 7a–c). The increase in electron:hole ratio in mCD/CNx suggested a decrease in the number of holes in CNx, presumably transferred to the mCD. The decreased signal for sCD/CNx near 700 nm indicated electron extraction from the CNx to sCD. The addition of Ag+ as electron scavenger resulted in decreased electron signal in mCD/CNx (Fig. 7d–f) and no changes in the electron absorption signal for sCD/CNx. These results identified that mCD acted as a hole acceptor in the mCD/CNx and accumulated holes transferred from CNx. The sCD instead played a role as an electron acceptor in the sCD/CNx heterojunction and accumulated electrons.

The mCD/CNx improved charge separation at the interface and achieved a 6-fold increase of the electron lifetime compared to pure CNx, contributing to the improved activity.94 Accumulating holes on the mCD potentially helps mitigate kinetic issues with the timescale mismatch of competing pathways of water oxidation (∼1 s) and charge recombination (<μs). The different charge carrier dynamics in the composites affected photocatalytic activity and product selectivity for the photocatalyzed reduction of CO2. The major products were different for each CD/CNx system: carbon monoxide for the sCD/CNx and methanol for mCD/CNx. The mCD/CNx composite showed a remarkable 99.6% ± 0.2% selectivity for methanol and a high internal quantum yield of 2.1% at 420 nm (with water as the source of electrons). The high selectivity was proposed to result from the preferential binding of methanol and CO2 to CNx and H2O to the mCD promoting the oxidation of water over the methanol product allowing for its continued production. This is a key example where the identification of the charge carrier dynamics using TAS helped rationalize the product formation and identified routes for improving the efficiency of the photocatalyst.
Metal-free CNx heterojunctions that have used TRPL to investigate the charge carrier dynamics include carbon dots CD/CNx,101,104,107 CNx/CNx,96,98,106 and organic polymer/CNx.124–126 We briefly discuss three reports that used TRPL as the main tool to investigate CD/CNx junctions.
The CD/CNx studied by Wang et al.104 showed that CD implemented in CNx nanotubes (CNNTs) and CD adsorbed on the surface of bulk CNx both resulted in lengthened TRPL lifetimes. The mCD/CNx junction mentioned above also showed a lengthened lifetime.94 The samples prepared by the one-pot and physical mixing methods of Qu et al.107 and the hydrothermally treated CD/p-CNx junction by Ong et al.101 instead all had shortened lifetimes compared to CNx.
CD/CNx composites exhibited both longer or shorter TRPL lifetimes in comparison to bulk CNx, but all demonstrated improved photocatalytic activity.94,101,104,107 In all cases, urea was the CNx precursor. However, the CD synthesis and CD/CNx junction formation were unique for each system. The lack of consistency or trends in the results points to unknown factors that control the fate of emissive states at the CD/CNx junction. Similarly to the change in being an electron or hole acceptor, it is possible that the function of the CD could dictate the lengthening or shortening of the heterojunction lifetime. Future inquiries directed towards identifying the interfacial contact at the CD/CNx heterojunction could present more definitive conclusions on how the charge carrier kinetics are affected by the formation of the CD/CNx junctions. This may include comparison of preformed vs. post-addition of CDs in the system, CD synthesis methods and more extensive charge carrier dynamics experiments to discover the finer details and complete our understanding of the kinetics of the junction.
The addition of graphene oxide (GO) or reduced graphene oxide (RGO) to CNx to form a heterojunction enhanced its catalytic activity through improved electronic communication between CNx and a molecular H2 cocatalyst.127 TAS measurements were used to monitor the charge transfer on μs to s time scales. CNx and CNx/RGO junction yielded similar TAS spectra and kinetics which suggested that GO/RGO did not affect charge separation, even on a sub-μs timescale. The TRPL decays were also indistinguishable with or without GO even at a high 50 wt% loading. In contrast, previous studies of GO/semiconductor junctions reported that the addition of GO resulted in decreased PL suggesting there was improved charge separation.128,129 Photoinduced absorption spectroscopy (PIAS; a quasi-steady-state version of TAS),130 was used to evaluate the charge carrier dynamics on longer time scales (>0.1 s). PIAS showed that electron extraction from CNx to the H2 cocatalyst was faster with GO/RGO.127 Overall a 3-fold increase in H2 photocatalytic activity was observed with the addition of a GO/RGO which can not be rationalized by increased charge separation in CNx. Rather, GO appeared to improve the connectivity between the cocatalyst and CNx through electronic and adsorption effects.
Black phosphorus/CNx junctions
Metal-free components in junction with CNx have not been limited to carbon- and nitrogen-containing materials and have expanded into boron and phosphorus.97,100,102,105 One such example is black phosphorus (BP), a metal-free semiconductor with high charge carrier mobility and tunable electrical and optical properties. Similarly to graphite, BP can be exfoliated to yield 2D phosphorene sheets, identified as a material with photocatalytic water spitting potential.131–134 Charge carrier dynamics studies using TRPL have been done for different types of BP in junction with CNx: BP quantum dots (BPQD), BP nanosheets and phosphorene.97,100,102 Interestingly, these report a large range of average lifetimes between 5 ns to 500 ns.
For the formation of the BPQD/CNx heterojunction, preformed BPQD and CNx were mixed in an aqueous solution, placed under vacuum, followed by stirring under irradiation.102 The average lifetime of CNx was found to be 3.85 ns, which lengthened to 4.92 ns for the most active photocatalyst (7 wt% BPQD/CNx) out of 4 junctions with an almost a 3.5-fold improved H2 evolution rate. The focus of this TRPL analysis looked at the individual τ1 and τ2 lifetimes utilizing Pt/CNx as the reference. τ1 of Pt/CNx and the most active 7 wt% BPQD/CNx sample were shortened compared to CNx. In contrast, τ2 and the average lifetimes of all samples were longer in comparison to CNx. While the authors did not comment on the apparent correlation between τ2 and the activity, they did suggest that there is an inverse relationship between τ1 and the activity. However, 3 wt% BPQD/CNx had a longer τ1 and still showed a 2-fold improved photocatalytic activity (117.8 μmol h−1 compared to 55 μmol h−1 for CNx).
A BP nanosheet heterojunction was synthesized by exfoliating BP with an ice-assisted ultrasonication method.100 CNx nanosheets (CNNS) were added to the resulting BP nanosheet dispersion and stirred under N2 at room temperature to form the heterojunction. The average TRPL decay lifetime (type unspecified) of CNNS and BP nanosheets/CNNS were 534 ns and 486 ns, respectively. The heterojunction showed almost 4.5-fold improvement in the H2 evolution rate while the charge carrier lifetime was only reduced by about a tenth.100
The final BP-based CNx heterojunction which measured the charge carrier dynamics using TRPL was a phosphorene/CNNS system.97 The phosphorene was synthesized by liquid-phase exfoliation of BP. CNNS were then added to an ethanolic phosphorene solution and stirred to yield the heterojunction. TRPL decays of CNNS and phosphorene/CNNS were fitted with a triexponential model. The extracted τ1, τ2, and τ3 components were 0.94 ns, 8.05 ns, 49.89 ns for CNNS and 1.38 ns, 8.47 ns, 50.29 ns for 1.8 wt% phosphorene/CNNS. Even though the changes in lifetimes were small, the photocatalytic H2 evolution of the phosphorene/CNNS was increased by more than 13-fold compared to CNNS.
One BP/CNx junction has been studied by TAS. A type I metal-free nanoflake BP/CNNS heterojunction showed improved light absorption and H2 evolution with a solar-to-hydrogen efficiency of 1.51%.135 Time-resolved diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (TDRS) was used to look at the dynamics of the charges in BP and CNNS in the heterojunction. The NIR irradiation of BP revealed a TAS signal representative of trapped electrons around 955 nm. The TAS signal showed a maximum absorption that was reached 2.6 ps after excitation, which then decayed to near the baseline in 9.6 ps due to recombination in BP (Fig. 8). The TAS spectra for the heterojunction showed a prolonged electron decay lifetime over a range of 4–501 ps. These results may indicate the bonding of BP to CNx resulted in the formation of a trap state, which prolonged the lifetime of charge carriers. The NIR decay kinetics at 950 nm of BP and BP/CNNS show the average lifetime of charge carriers in BP was 0.8 ps and was 44 ps in BP/CNNS (Fig. 8). It is suggested that the P–N bond at the BP/CNNS interface behaves as a trap state causing the lengthened lifetime and the smaller electronegativity of P allows protons to more readily adsorb creating a pronated state for proton reduction. This results in the improved H2 evolution activity of the heterojunction. The TAS investigation under visible light showed the BP/CNNS TA was primarily a result of the photogenerated electrons in CNx because BP displayed fast recombination under visible light (< 4 ps). The kinetics of the sample showed that the average lifetime of the heterojunction (73 ps) is smaller than the lifetime of pure CNx (101 ps). This is suggested to be due to BP presenting a pathway for electron transfer from CNx. TAS allowed for the identification of the role of the BP/CNx interface for photocatalytic improvement.

Ru-Containing molecular cocatalysts in CNx junctions
Molecular catalysts have the advantage of facile modification of their properties. Controlling the arrangement of specific atoms and fine tuning their catalytic centre leads to the high selectivity and activity of molecular catalysts. To improve their stability, molecular catalysts can be immobilized on the surface of the photosensitizer. The properties of metal-containing molecular catalysts can be altered through changes in the ligand field.136 Ishitani and Maeda et al. have published an interesting series of reports on Ru-containing complexes for CO2 reduction in CNx junctions (Fig. 9).119–122,137
 Fig. 9  Chemical structure of Ru-containing cocatalysts used with CNx used by Ishitani and Maeda et al. 
The addition of trans(Cl)-Ru{4,4′-(H2PO3)2bpy}-(CO)2Cl2 (RuP) to mesoporous CNx (mpg-CNx) gave a photocatalytic system that reduced CO2 to HCOOH with an AQY of 5.7% at 400 nm and a turnover number (TON) of over 1000.138RuP is the CO2 reduction catalyst and without it mpg-CNx did not produce any HCOOH. TRPL was unable to detect any difference in the charge carrier dynamics between mpg-CNx and RuP/mpg-CNx.122 Steady-state PL of mpg-CNx also did not show any changes when adding an electron donor (EDTA) or an electron acceptor (RuP). To detect signals from less- or non-luminescent sites that may be involved in charge transfer, TAS was used. The spectral range was used to infer the energetics of the trap states. Transient absorption bands in the visible – NIR range (20000–3000 cm−1; 500–3333 nm) are attributed to deeply trapped charges and those in the mid-IR region (3000–1000 cm−1; 3333–10000 nm) are attributed to free or shallowly trapped electrons (see Fig. 11). These energetic electrons are expected to be more strongly correlated with photoreduction activity.

RuP/mpg-CNx was excited with a 400 nm pulse and the TAS spectra at different delay times were recorded.122 No signals that could be attributed to the vibration of carbonyl groups of RuP were detected near 1900 cm−1 (5260 nm), indicating that charges in mpg-CNx dominate the spectrum. The decay kinetics were taken for mpg-CNx and RuP/mpg-CNx at 1900 cm−1 and 6000 cm−1 (1670 nm) (Fig. 10) to distinguish between free/shallowly trapped electrons and deeply trapped electrons. At 1900 cm−1, RuP/mpg-CNx showed a quicker decay than mpg-CNx (Fig. 10A) over a few ps. RuP/mpg-CNx also had a quicker decay at 6000 cm−1 but it was much less pronounced (Fig. 10C and D). Although not quantified, this difference between the decays at 1900 cm−1 and 6000 cm−1 implies that free and shallowly trapped electrons are much more able to transfer to RuP compared to deeply trapped electrons. Since TAS was able to detect a difference between the decay of RuP/mpg-CNx and mpg-CNx and TRPL was not, this indicates that electron transfer occurs from less- or non-luminescent sites instead of the main emission sites.

The co-polymerization of urea and phenylurea (PU) yielded a modified CNNS-PU with improved light absorption >400 nm.121 Adding RuP to the optimized CNNS-PU resulted in a RuP/CNNS-PU photocatalyst with a 1.1% AQY at 400 nm for the reduction of CO2 to formate. The TAS decays of CNNS and CNNS-PU monitored at 2000 cm−1 (5000 nm; shallow trapped or free electrons) showed an increased signal amplitude and lengthened lifetime (not quantified) for CNNS-PU. The effect of RuP on the charge carrier dynamics was not investigated in this case.
Two reports looked at how the addition of Ag nanoparticles could improve the CO2 reduction efficiency. In the first example, Ag nanoparticles were loaded on mpg-CNx and the bimetallic complex RuRu′ was anchored to the junction.119 The optimized RuRu′/Ag/mpg-CNx produced formate with an AQY of 5.2% at 400 nm. The TAS spectra for both mpg-CNx and Ag/mpg-CNx showed broad features across the visible to MIR range (Fig. 11). Notably, the lower energy signal at lower wavenumbers was reduced for Ag/mpg-CNx. The kinetics at 2000 cm−1 showed an additional fast decay on the tens of microsecond timescale for Ag/mpg-CNx compared to mpg-CNx. At 5000 cm−1, the fast decay was still observed but with a lower amplitude. This suggests that shallowly trapped electrons can more easily transfer to the Ag nanoparticles, which acts as an electron pool for the reduction of CO2, compared to deeply trapped electrons.

In the other silver-containing system RuP was added to silver-modified CNNS (Ag-CNNS) to form a junction that could reduce CO2 to formate (>90% selectivity) with an AQY of 4.2% at 400 nm and a TON of 5775.120 Extended X-ray absorption fine structure revealed that both Ag0 and Ag2O were present in Ag-CNNS. To determine their impact on photoreduction, Ag-CNNS were prepared using different synthesis methods to control the amount of Ag0 or Ag2O formed. The composite with low Ag0 content exhibited the highest photoactivity. The TAS for all samples was monitored at 1800 cm−1 (5555 nm) to follow the dynamics of free and shallowly trapped electrons. All the silver-modified composites demonstrated faster decays versus CNNS. The differences were not quantified but a broad trend emerged of Ag-CNNS with faster decays showing better performance in the RuP/Ag-CNNS samples. These results imply that electrons can transfer from CNNS to the Ag nanoparticles and eventually participate in CO2 reduction through RuP. The TAS for RuP-containing composites was not reported and prevented clearly establishing a correlation between the charge carrier dynamics and the photoactivity of RuP/Ag-CNNS.
A hybrid photocatalyst consisting of TiO2, a binuclear Ru(II)–Re(I) complex (RuRe) and CNNS showed a 4-fold increase in the rate of CO evolution with high selectivity versus the composite without TiO2.137 The shape of the TAS spectra were nearly identical between CNNS and TiO2/CNNS, indicating that the signal is mainly due to charges in CNx and that distribution of trap states in CNNS does not change much with the addition of TiO2. Looking at the kinetics of free or shallowly trapped electrons monitored at 1800 cm−1 (5555 nm), it is clear that TiO2/CNNS gave a longer lifetime than CNNS (Fig. 12). Thus, the population of mobile electrons was increased by the formation of the junction with TiO2. Interestingly, the residual signal for TiO2/CNNS shows roughly a 4-fold increase from that of CNNS, in line with the increase in photocatalytic activity. At 5000 cm−1 (2000 nm), the TiO2/CNNS lifetime was also longer than for CNNS but the difference was not as pronounced as for 1800 cm−1. The reduced difference at this wavelength is reasonable as the decay is attributed to deeply trapped electrons, which are less mobile and thus less sensitive to interfacial effects. Improved binding durability of the RuRe catalyst was also observed in TiO2/CNNS and may also contribute to the increased photocatalytic activity.

MoS2/CNx
The 1T-MoS2 polymorph was identified as a promising cocatalyst due to the charge separation and transfer efficiency seen in MoS2/CdS heterojunctions in a hydrogen evolving photocatalytic system.139 The attachment of metallic phase 1T-MoS2 to oxygenated monolayer CNx (O-CNNS) was done using an in situ growth method that bound Mo5+ to the surface of O-CNNS. The improvement in photocatalytic H2 evolution with 0.2 wt% MoS2/O-CNNS was 245-fold compared to pure O-CNNS, and a 4-fold compared to Pt/O-CNNS.114 The TRPL decays showed that increasing the loading from 0.1 to 0.5 wt% 1T-MoS2 led to the reduction of the decay lifetime (type unspecified) from 4.06 ns to 3.35 ns.
Another MoS2/CNx heterojunction (with 2H-MoS2 polymorph characteristics) displayed shortened TRPL lifetimes (type unspecified) with increasing MoS2 content, ranging from 2.35 ns with 0 wt% MoS2 to 1.79 ns for 1.25 wt% MoS2 (Fig. 13b).117 The highest activity was found in the intermediary composite with 0.75 wt% MoS2 with a lifetime of 2.02 ns and an AQY of 6.8% at 420 nm (Fig. 13d). The same group reported a ternary heterojunction containing MoS2/reduced graphene oxide (RGO)/CNx synthesized using a similar solvothermal method.116,117 The results show that increasing MoS2 content in the MoS2/RGO/CNx heterojunction also resulted in decreasing the TRPL decay lifetime. Average lifetimes (type unspecified) ranged from 2.1 ns for CNx to 1.7 ns for 2 wt% MoS2/RGO/CNx.116 The binary CNx/RGO junction also showed a slightly decreased lifetime of 2.01 ns. The highest activity was recorded for the 1.2 wt% MoS2/RGO/CNx heterojunction with a 24-fold improvement in H2 photocatalytic activity compared to CNx.

The photo-electrocatalytic activity of methanol, ethanol, and formic acid oxidation using Pt/MoS2/CNx synthesized using a solvothermal method was measured using cyclic voltammetry.118 The cyclic voltammograms showed the forward peak current densities under visible light (mA mg−1 Pt) of Pt/MoS2/CNx are improved for methanol, ethanol, and formic acid production compared to Pt/CNx.118 The TRPL results were obtained without the Pt and show the CNx and 10 wt% MoS2/CNx average lifetimes to be 1.74 ns and 1.17 ns, respectively.118
All of the 2D/2D MoS2/CNx heterojunction results showed consistent trends that increasing MoS2 content resulted in decreased decay lifetime, with wt% of MoS2 in the range of 0.1–2% or 10% in the different variations studied. The reduced lifetime was suggested to be a result of interfacial charge transfer from CNx to the MoS2 which reduced charge recombination in CNx.114,116 Reliable trends from different reports is unlike the other heterojunction material groups we surveyed. The trend in TRPL lifetime is possibly related to the consistency of forming 2D/2D interfaces where stacked sheets can be expected, reducing variability in the orientation.140 An interesting concept that has not received attention is considering how the nanostructure of the different polymorphs of MoS2, the semiconducting trigonal coordinate MoS2 phase (2H-MoS) and the octahedral metallic phase 1T-MoS2 affect the dynamics of charges in CNx heterojunctions.141
Charge carrier dynamics studies on MoS2/CNx heterojunctions that employed TAS include research on the effect of vacancy defects in CNx and different MoS2 nanostructures.113,115 Xue et al. applied fs-TDRS to measure the flow of charges in MoS2/CNNS systems with nitrogen vacancies in the CNNS.113 CNNSs with nitrogen vacancies (Vns-CNNS) were synthesized by calcining dicyanamide at 600 °C and exfoliating the bulk product to form nanosheets. Mid-gap states C3+(Vn) and C4+(Vn) resulting from the formation of the nitrogen vacancies were identified using DFT. These states were formed when the excess electrons from the loss of the nitrogen are transferred to a neighboring carbon atom creating C3+(Vn) states or to a further carbon resulting in the unoccupied C4+(Vn) states. The TDRS investigation utilized a 420 nm excitation wavelength, which revealed that the signal predominantly resulted from the photogenerated electrons in the CNNS. The TAS decay kinetics of CNNSs with and without nitrogen vacancies were fit with a multiexponential function identifying three short decay lifetimes (τ1 < 5 ps, τ2 < 60 ps, τ3 < 1 ns) assigned to trapping in shallow trap states and a long lifetime (τ0 ≫ 1 ns) for deep trap states (Fig. 14a). Electrons occupying deep trap states do not participate in photocatalytic reactions and will subsequently recombine. The TAS decay lifetimes of electrons are similar but the coefficients for the two shortest lifetimes of the Vns-CNNS (A1 = 0.24 and A2 = 0.20) are increased compared to those of CNNS (A1 = 0.07 and A2 = 0.15). It is proposed that C3+(Vn) trap holes; however, since the C4+(Vn) dominates the Vn states, the C3+(Vn) presence is not significant enough to alter the kinetic decay. The C4+(Vn) are proposed to behave as shallows trap states increasing the proportion of shallow trapped electrons close to the CB (Fig. 14c and d). MoS2/CNNS was excited with 600 nm light to reveal the decay kinetics of photogenerated electrons in the MoS2. The results were similar to the previously mentioned Vns-CNNS vs. CNNS comparison; There were more Mo4+ shallow trap states in the MoS2/Vns-CNNS than MoS2/CNNS (Fig. 14c and d). The kinetics of the heterojunction at 420 nm excitation wavelength revealed that the lifetime of the charge carriers in τ2 and τ3 are shorter than in CNNS (τ1 is excluded because it was quenched due to the presence of MoS2). This suggested the electrons in the shallow trap states can also be transferred to MoS2 to increase spatial charge separation. The TAS analysis allowed for the elucidation of the rationale for the improved lifetime observed in the presence of vacancy defects, concluding that the improved interfacial electron transfer from the high density of shallow trap states gave the improved H2 evolution.

TAS investigations by Shi et al. have also looked at the charge carrier dynamic in MoS2/CNx heterojunctions. However, they focused on the effect of different MoS2 nanostructures [nanodots (ND-MoS2) or monolayers (m-MoS2)].115 The m-MoS2/CNx was synthesized by mixing preformed MoS2 nanosheets and CNNS in suspension. The nanodot MoS2 heterojunction (ND-MoS2/CNx) was formed very similarly to the method used by Xue et al. using an in situ photodeposition. The activity for the 3.2 wt% ND-MoS2/CNx (660 μmol g−1 h−1) was increased 7.9-fold compared to that of 6.4 wt% m-MoS2/CNx (83.8 μmol g−1 h−1), and the activity of pure CNNS was less than 10 μmol g−1 h−1. The 6.4 wt% m-MoS2/CNx and 3.2 wt% ND-MoS2/CNx heterojunctions were investigated using TRPL and TDRS. The TRPL results showed a trend of shortening the average lifetime upon formation of the heterojunction: CNNSs (2.55 ns) > m-MoS2/CNx(2.32 ns) > ND-MoS2/CNx (1.85 ns). The electron transfer rate and efficiency of electron transfer were also calculated for ND-MoS2/CNx and m-MoS2/CNx, which, respectively, gave rates of 1.5 × 108 s−1 and 3.8 × 107 s−1 with efficiencies of 28% and 9%. The TDRS transient spectra were reported using a 400 nm laser pulse and the signal at different time delays after excitation in the 800–1200 nm range represent trapped electrons in CNx (Fig. 15A–C). The transient absorbance at 950 nm of the heterojunction samples increases up to a maximum at around 2 ps followed by a gradual decrease. At a 60 ps delay, there was a 36.6% and 29.5% decrease from the maximum absorbance for ND-MoS2/CNx and m-MoS2/CNx (Fig. 15B and C). The pure CNx sample showed less of a drastic absorbance decrease of 18% (Fig. 15A) suggesting there is a fast decay of excited electrons in the CNx components of the heterojunctions. The initial τ1 lifetimes of the composites (1.70 ± 0.70 ps and 4.00 ± 0.90 ps for ND-MoS2/CNx and m-MoS2/CNx, respectively) were fast compared to that of the CNx (36.5 ± 2.60 ps) and attributed to the transfer of electrons to MoS2 (Fig. 15D). The average lifetime, electron transfer rate and efficiency were determined using TDRS similar to the calculations for TRPL. A similar trend to the TRPL results was revealed, where CNx (459 ps) > m-MoS2/CNx (293 ps) > ND-MoS2/CNx (122 ps). The electron transfer rate is three times faster in the ND-MoS2/CNx (5.96 × 109 s−1) than in the m-MoS2/CNx (1.23 × 109 s−1). The electron injection efficiencies were calculated to be 73.3% and 36.1% for ND-MoS2/CNx and m-MoS2/CNx, respectively. It was suggested that the improved electron injection efficiency is due to the more effective interaction of the nanodots with CNx which resulted in 7.9-fold improvement in photocatalytic activity.

Metal phosphide/CNx junctions
Transition metal phosphides such as FePx, NixPy, CoxPy, MoPx, WPx and Cu3P have shown high hydrogen evolving or oxygen evolving activity making then attractive Earth abundant catalyst options.142 Metal phosphides with both high proton reduction and water oxidation activity include FePx, NixPy and CoxPy.142 It is proposed that the improved oxygen evolution from the Fe, Co, Ni phosphides series is due to in situ active sites generating oxo/hydroxide and improved electrical conductivity compared to their metal oxide equivalents.142,143 Interestingly, there have been two separate studies that compare CNx in junction with phosphides of the first-row transition metals Fe, Co, and Ni phosphides. The first was performed by Sun et al.108 Each metal phosphide (M2P) was synthesized using similar procedures from the respective metal nitride. The heterojunctions were formed in an identical manner by suspending the M2P and sulphur doped CNx (S-CNx) in DMF followed by mixing and drying to form 5 wt% M2P/S-CNx. The TRPL data showed that the formation of all M2P/S-CNx heterojunctions resulted in shorter lifetimes compared to the S-CNx alone. The decay lifetimes went from 2.82 ns for S-CNx to 2.45 ns, 1.87 ns, and 1.57 ns for Fe2P/S-CNx, Co2P/S-CNx, and Ni2P/S-CNx, respectively (Fig. 16). A lifetime of 2.1 ns for Pt/S-CNx was obtained for comparison. The photocatalytic activity for H2 evolution increases in the order S-CNx < Fe2P/S-CNx < Pt/S-CNx < Co2P/S-CNx < Ni2P/S-CNx. There is a clear trend of shortened lifetime associated with increased activity in all the studied samples, strongly suggesting that the metal phosphide/CNx junction can separate emissive charge carriers. It is also noted that Pt is a less active proton reduction catalyst compared to Co2P and Ni2P in these junctions demonstrating the exciting potential of metal phosphides.

The other comparison of first row transition metal phosphides, namely Fe2P, CoP and Ni2P, was done in a ternary junction with molybdenum sulphide (MoS2) and CNNS to form MoS2/MPx/CNNS.110 The synthesis of the ternary junction was done similarly for each MPx. Initially, the binary MPx/CNNS catalyst is formed by mixing CNNS, the metal nitrate and NaOH in an aqueous dispersion followed by in situ phosphorization. An MoS2 dispersion was added to a mixture with the binary MPx/CNNS and placed under high temperature and pressure to form the final ternary MoS2/MPx P/CNNS heterojunction. The TRPL decay lifetimes show the intensity-weighted lifetime decreased in the order of CNNS (7.12 ns), MoS2/CNNS (6.05 ns), MoS2/Fe2P/CNNS (5.76 ns), MoS2/CoP/CNNS (5.38 ns), and MoS2/Ni2P/CNNS (5.02 ns). The activities increased in the order of CNNS (0.01 μmol h−1 g−1), CNNS/MoS2 (215.32 μmol h−1 g−1), MoS2/Fe2P/CNNS (426.79 μmol h−1 g−1), MoS2/CoP/CNNS (467.25 μmol h−1 g−1) and MoS2/Ni2P/CNNS (532.41 μmol h−1 g−1).110 There is a correlated trend with shortened lifetimes and increasing activity which was also seen by Sun et al. when looking at phosphides of the same three first row transition metal.108 This is the sole example of a CNx heterojunction that we could find that had consistent results from multiple sources. The TRPL results from both studies indicated that Ni2P is the most effective cocatalyst for photocatalytic H2 evolution, in line with the highest electrocatalytic activity also seen with Ni2P.110
Various other NixPx catalysts were investigated using TRPL such as Ni2P nanoparticles,109 Ni12P5 nanoparticles144 and Ni2P quantum dots (QD).111 Indra et al. undertook an in-depth analysis of the TRPL decays of different Ni2P/mpg-CNx preparations.112 The Ni2P was either physically mixed (PM) with mpg-CNx in solvent followed by solvent evaporation or chemically integrated (CI) by heating a nickel salt, NaPO2H2 and mpg-CNx under an inert gas. The photocatalytic activity of the 2 wt% CI-Ni2P/mpg-CNx was increased 3-fold compared to that of the 2 wt% PM catalyst and 60-fold compared to pure mpg-CNx. A range of Ni2P loadings were investigated and, notably, the TRPL demonstrated no difference in lifetimes in any of the samples (Fig. 17). A more in-depth analysis considered a 1-dimensional transport model to fit the TRPL decays. This model considers the movement of electrons in CNx to be dominantly interplanar 1D diffuse hopping between CNx sheets.145 The calculated rate constant of charge carrier hopping is calculated to be approximately 109 s−1 for all samples.112 Their interpretation is of interest as they argued that most of the charge carriers may not reach the interface of the heterojunction or surface of CNx and instead recombine within the material CNx. This accounts for the similar TRPL results in each sample. They insightfully pointed out that TRPL only measures charges that recombine radiatively, which only accounts for <10% of charge carriers in CNx based on its PL quantum yield.73–79

Techniques other than TRPL and TAS
We only found two examples of charge carrier measurements of CNx heterojunctions with techniques other than TRPL and TAS in our literature search. Che et al. used transient open-circuit voltage decay to probe a graphitic carbon ring (Cring)/CNNS heterojunction.23 Glucose and melamine were heated together at 300 °C for 1 h and 400 °C for another hour to form a π-conjugate with fused heptazine and carbon rings. The heating continued at 550 °C for 4 h to initiate polymerization of this conjugate and yield a heterostructural nanosheet with carbon and heptazine domains. The Cring/CNNS loaded with 3 wt% Pt could perform photocatalytic water splitting without sacrificial agents at H2 and O2 evolution rates up to 371 and 184 μmol g−1 h−1, respectively, a 7-fold improvement over CNx. The water splitting AQY of 5% at 420 nm is notable. Mott–Schottky plots revealed that Cring/CNNS had 1 order of magnitude higher carrier density compared to pristine CNx. The corresponding increased electron mobility and a higher measured work function is thought to result in effective electron accumulation in Cring/CNNS. Transient open-circuit voltage decay measurements showed a larger photovoltage (−0.11 V vs. −0.09 V) and a slower decay when the light is turned off (lifetimes longer by about 5-fold) for Cring/CNNS compared to CNx (Fig. 18d). These results support improved charge separation and reduced recombination in the heterojunction.

Muñoz-Batista et al.61 characterized a ternary CeO2–TiO2/CNx–Mn+ junction using TRMC. The CeO2–TiO2 composite was prepared through a microemulsion route. CNx was prepared using melamine and CaCl2 and/or FeCl2 to obtain cation-modified CNx. The ternary junction was formed by the incipient wetness impregnation method. A methanol dispersion of CNx was deposited on CeO2–TiO2 and dried at 110 °C for 24 h. The ternary samples had about 1 wt% CNx, 6 wt% CeO2, 93 wt% TiO2 and Fe or Ca on the order of 10−2 mol%. The photocatalytic activity was measured for the photooxidation of toluene which gave benzaldehyde and CO2 as products. Considering both the effect of absorption and the chemical selectivity the quantum efficiencies were compared. Under solar-type irradiation, the reference TiO2 sample had a quantum efficiency of 3.0 × 10−4% and that for CNx was 0.8 × 10−4%. Amongst 7 different junctions tested, only CeO2–TiO2/CNx–Ca showed a significant improvement to give a quantum efficiency of 4.2 × 10−4%. The lifetime of charge carriers measured by TRMC, on the order of 200 ns, did not vary between different samples and minor differences in signal intensities were observed. This was rationalized as the signal being dominated by charges in the TiO2 bulk and that only a small fraction of TiO2 is in intimate contact with the other constituents.
Conclusions and future directions
CNx has quickly become one of, if not the most, studied polymeric photocatalyst. However, its efficiency for photosynthetic reactions without sacrificial reagents needs to be improved for it to become a viable solar energy conversion technology. Many different CNx heterojunctions have been formed with the aim of improving photocatalytic efficiency. The complexity of interfacial charge transfer necessitates the use of advanced tools to develop our understanding of the key factors that control charge flow at the interface. This is important considering the range of possible CNx chemical structures18,146 and the apparent differences in the materials prepared in different laboratories. A wide range of activities are reported for similar procedures using common precursors such as melamine or urea.
TRPL is becoming a more routine experiment, but it has important limitations that should be given stronger consideration. A critical consideration is the typical PL quantum yield of CNx is 10% or less. This is significantly smaller than the AQY for photocatalytic reactions which can reach over 50%. This raises serious doubts as to whether the TRPL decay can be representative of the charge carrier population, especially those involved in interfacial charge transfer. While the vast majority of systems report a change in TRPL kinetics, perhaps a result of selection bias, multiple spectroscopy-focused studies report no change in TRPL upon formation of a junction.79,112,127 The example by Kuriki et al.122 is striking as TRPL showed no changes yet TAS showed clear changes in kinetics, highlighting its ability to monitor charges involved in interfacial charge transfers. It has been suggested that the emission centers may be within the bulk and distinct from catalytically active surface sites. The factors that make a change in TRPL observable or not, which likely include the PL quantum yield, the exciton or charge diffusion length, and the spatial distribution of emissive sites, are not well-defined.
Despite the popularity of CNx materials, our photophysical understanding still appears limited. The next few paragraphs highlight questions that remain open. More systematic charge carrier dynamics studies will simplify the design of more efficient systems. The disparate longer or shorter TRPL lifetimes that can both be associated with increased activity is not isolated to CNx but can also be seen in TiO2 heterojunctions.147–149 Elucidating the charge carrier dynamics of heterojunctions will shift us away from unreliable assumptions and toward developing a clearer picture of the underlying mechanisms that yield significant improvements.
As seen in Tables 1 and 2, the relative activity often increases by a factor of 10 or more while the relative lifetime usually increases or decreases by a factor of 2 or less, with no clear correlation emerging. The challenge in determining the productive charge transfer efficiency in the reference CNx makes it difficult to determine whether the small changes in relative lifetime can be reconciled with the large changes in relative activity. Interestingly, despite the large range of improvements, reported AQYs are usually a few percent. This indicates that the differences are significantly impacted by the performance of the reference CNx, highlighting the difficulty in comparing materials prepared by different groups. Estimates of the charge transfer efficiency to a cocatalyst by TRPL are often over 30% (assuming that shorter lifetimes are caused by charge transfer), significantly larger than the AQY. This discrepancy may be due to the distinction between active and emissive sites discussed above or to accumulation effects under the continuous wave excitation of operating conditions.150 A more accurate description of the photophysics and deactivation pathways in CNx will help us rationalize the link between lifetimes and activity.151,152
Interestingly, even though Pt is among the most common proton reduction catalyst used, our literature search revealed that there are very few detailed charge carrier dynamics studies on Pt/CNx heterojunctions. One notable report is the incorporation of isolated single Pt atoms to CNx.153 fs-TAS showed a two-fold lengthening of the decay kinetics compared to bare CNx (433 ps vs. 237 ps). When Pt NPs were formed, the lifetime (117 ps) was instead 2-fold shorter. No conclusive explanations could be made. The few other measurements of Pt/CNx we found have shown a range of results: faster TRPL kinetics,102,108 a small decrease in electron signal and no changes in kinetics,154 or increased hole amplitude and slower kinetics.155 The kinetics of charge transfer to Pt under operating conditions are still unclear and warrant deeper investigations.
How the atomic arrangement at the CNx heterojunction interface affects the charge carrier dynamics is not clear yet multiple reports point to a crucial role. A striking example is the reversal of charge flow at a CD/CNx depending on how the CDs were prepared (Fig. 7).94 TAS indicated that CDs can have both hole-accepting or electron-accepting function. The factors that dictate their function are not understood and this example highlights the potential pitfalls of assuming the charge transfer direction. Other examples of the importance of the interface are given by the activity or charge transfer differences observed when comparing junctions made by physically mixing preformed components to ones where one of the components is grown in the presence of another.107,112 The application of precise structural characterization tools and assignments will help us understand the photophysics of CNx and charge transfer at its interface.
We also notice that most studies only report the charge carrier dynamics of the optimal junction preparation and a reference CNx. This makes the observations and conclusions more prone to misinterpretation. Much stronger conclusions can be garnered through the observation of trends to reduce the influence of unintended changes. More studies that look at the charge carrier dynamics in a range of preparations are needed.
Charge carrier dynamics studies of CNx heterojunctions have almost exclusively used TRPL or TAS. We only found two examples of other methods used.23,61 Expanding the use of other techniques will help develop broad conclusions that do not originate from limitations or artefacts tied to a single technique. The recent development of well-defined thin films with good electrical contact is interesting in this regard.156–158 These types of samples open the door to a greater variety of experimental techniques than the challenging heterogeneous dispersions. These thin films are also being developed for photoelectrochemical applications which dramatically increases the relevance of (photo)electrical characterization as the interface with the electrode is now part of the active system.

Table Content:

Emma Mitchell
	Emma Mitchell received her BSc in Chemistry from Queen's University. She is currently pursuing her MSc at the University of British Columbia (Okanagan). Her research interests include sustainable energy production, photocatalysis, charge carrier dynamics and spectroscopy.

Abigail Law
	Abigail Law is studying at Saint Francis Xavier University, with research interests in economically and environmentally sustainable energy production. In summer 2020, she received an NSERC Undergraduate Student Research Award and worked under Dr Robert Godin as a summer student researcher through the Reactive Intermediate Student Exchange program. Currently, she is in her third year in the bachelor of arts and science in health program, with plans of completing an honors in biomedicine and later pursing a PhD related to sustainable energy.

Robert Godin
	Robert Godin born in Bathurst, New Brunswick, Canada, Robert has been interested in photochemistry since the start of his higher education. After learning a breath of photochemistry and spectroscopy techniques working with Prof. Tito Scaiano (BSc, University of Ottawa) and Prof. Gonzalo Cosa (PhD, McGill University), Robert completed a postdoctoral stint with Prof. James Durrant at Imperial College London and entered the field of solar energy conversion. In 2018, he established his independent group at UBC in Kelowna. The group develops time-resolved spectroscopic tools to better understand carbon-based semiconductors for sustainable energy production, with a healthy dose of physical organic chemistry concepts.

 	Fig. 1  The top panel shows the structure of carbon nitride, CNx, in the most relevant melon structure.8 The bottom panel shows the Kubelka–Munk transform of CNx diffuse reflectance spectra (left axis, red solid line) and the photoluminescence spectra of CNx (right axis, blue dashed line).	 

 	Fig. 2  Kinetic competitions in the steps of charge separation, charge transport and surface redox reactions. The initial exciton is represented by the dashed oval and separates into a free electron and hole. The rates (R) of the different processes are indicated and will dictate the yield of each step. Abbreviations: CB is conduction band, VB is valence band, CS is charge separation, rec is recombination, trans is transport, red is reduction, ox is oxidation, rxn is reaction.	 

 	Fig. 3  Schematic representation of representative heterojunctions. Interfacial charge transfers are indicated by the teal arrows. (A) CNx alone. (B) CNx in junction with a non-light absorbing cocatalyst. (C) CNx in junction with a semiconductor which absorbs at longer wavelengths. The direction of the charge transfer would be dependent on the band alignment and electric fields at the interface. (D) Like (C) but here electrons and holes from the two different materials recombine near the interface to give a Z-scheme.	 

 	Fig. 4  Representation of the three different types of heterojunctions. Electrons and holes are drawn where they would be expected to accumulate.	 
	(1)

 	Fig. 5  Energy diagram showing band-to-band carrier radiative relaxation competing with relaxation through non-radiative charge trapping. −Δ indicates the release of heat.	 
	(2)

 	Fig. 6  (A) Energy diagram outlining electronic transitions that result in absorbance in the (A) ground state and (B) excited state. The colours of the arrows are linked to the colours of the spectra in (C) and (D). (C) Example of absorption spectra for the ground and excited state. (D) The difference in absorption of the traces shown in (C) separated in its photoinduced absorption (PIA) and ground state bleaching (GSB) contributions.
