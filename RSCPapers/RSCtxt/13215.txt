    , Accepted 21st December 2012First published on 21st December 2012AbstractA transparent MoS2–graphene nanosheet (GNS) nanocomposite counter electrode (CE) was incorporated into a Pt-free dye-sensitized solar cell (DSC). The DSC assembled with the transparent MoS2–GNS CE therefore exhibited an impressive photovoltaic conversion efficiency of 5.81%, up to 93% of that obtained using the conventional Pt CE (6.24%).
In a typical DSC, a counter electrode (CE) possessing both high electrical conductivity and excellent electrocatalytic activity is indispensable to maintain a low overvoltage and to speed up the regeneration of I− from I3−. Due to the fact that Pt, widely used for CEs at present, is a costly metal, extensive studies have been made on Pt-like alternatives, including carbon-based materials,1–3 conducting polymers,4,5 and metals in the form of sulfides,6–8 nitrides,9,10 and carbides.11,12
To achieve a comparable electrocatalytic activity to that of the conventional Pt CE, carbon-based CEs must have sufficient surface area due to the fact that the active sites for I3−/I− redox reaction are defects and oxygen-containing groups located at crystal edges of graphite.1,2 In most cases, unfortunately, the carbon-based CEs should be thick enough (ca. 1–150 μm) to obtain the desired electrocatalytic activity. This makes the device bulkier and obviously nontransparent to visible light. Nevertheless, the characteristic of optical transparency is a substantial benefit of DSCs for certain practical applications, like roof panels, windows or various decorative facilities.13 Additionally, a transparent CE is essential for the operations of metal-foil-supported plastic DSCs.14
Hence, there is a need for further search for Pt-free CEs with both transparency and fast transfer kinetics for I3−/I− redox reaction. Recently, graphene, a carbon material consisting of a two-dimensional sheet of covalently-bonded carbon atoms, has attracted extensive attention of researchers due to its high optical transparency, large surface area, and prominent electrical conductivity.15 As such, graphene seems to be a promising candidate for this purpose. Nevertheless, graphene's basal plane is not electrocatalytically active in nature due to the limited amount of active sites for I3− reduction.16 Zhang et al.17 reported a graphene CE with an efficiency of 2.94% after annealing it at 450 °C. Cruz et al.18 reported a graphene CE composed of reduced graphene oxide with good transparency but with a poor cell efficiency of 2.64%. To enhance the electrocatalytic activity of graphene, it can be envisaged that decorating graphene films with functional nanoparticles would increase the number of electrocatalytically active sites on the graphene film, thus resulting in not only superior electrocatalytic activity, but also a much faster electron transport through the composite film. Yen et al.19 first reported a Pt-dispersed graphene composite CE which exhibited an enhanced photovoltaic performance (6.35%) compared to pristine graphene CE (2.89%). Das et al.20 further synthesized CoS-implanted graphene film as a CE which showed improved cell efficiency (3.42%) compared to pristine graphene CE (1.27%). In our previous study,21 we successfully prepared a MoS2–graphene flake composite CE for DSCs by mixing the commercially available MoS2 nanoparticles and graphene flakes, and obtained an impressive efficiency of 5.98%, up to ∼96% of Pt CE; but this CE was not transparent optically.
To the best of our knowledge, transparent MoS2–graphene nanosheet (GNS) CEs in DSCs have not yet been presented so far. As such, in this communication, MoS2–GNS composites were synthesized via a facile one-step hydrothermal synthesis method and then subjected to electrophoresis onto a fluorinated tin oxide (FTO) glass substrate at room temperature. The resultant MoS2–GNS composite CE demonstrated both high transmittance (>70%) at visible wavelengths and improved electrocatalytic activity, while the DSC based on the transparent CE still achieved an impassive cell efficiency of 5.81%, which is up to 93% of that obtained with the conventional Pt CE. Moreover, the MoS2–GNS composite films obtained by the facile electrophoretic deposition from suspension possess outstanding benefits, such as low temperature, high deposition rate, controlled thickness, excellent uniformity, large scale production, and without any binders.
The synthesis of MoS2–GNS nanocomposites was carried out by thermal hydrolysis/dissociation of thiourea in the presence of graphene oxide (GO) in an aqueous solution consisting of sodium molybdate as a source of molybdenum (see ESI,† Experimental section). As a result of many functional groups on the surface of GO, such as carboxyl, hydroxyl and epoxy groups, MoO42− anions could be tightly adsorbed onto the GO surface. During the thermal hydrolysis/dissociation process of thiourea, the released H2S reduces MoO42− and GO to MoS2 and GNS. Fig. 1a shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the as-prepared pristine MoS2 and MoS2–GNS nanocomposite. The MoS2–GNS nanocomposite displays a similar crystalline structure to that of pristine MoS2, which can be indexed to the standard MoS2 nanocrystal with a hexagonal structure (JCPDS 37-1492). Additionally, the peak intensity of the (002) plane at 2θ = 14.2° for the MoS2–GNS nanocomposites became lower compared with that for the pristine MoS2, indicating that the growth of the (002) plane is inhibited due to the presence of graphene. Fig. 1b shows the typical Raman spectrum of the MoS2–GNS nanocomposites. Two apparent Raman characteristic bands at 406 and 383 cm−1 for the MoS2 nanoparticles can be observed, which correspond to the A1g and E2g modes respectively.22 In the higher wavelength region (see the inset in Fig. 1b), the peaks around 1370 and 1600 cm−1 are responsible for the D and G bands of the GNS, respectively. The G band is mainly associated with the in-plane bond stretching of pairs of sp2 C atoms, while the D mode is attributed to defects or lattice distortion.23Fig. 1c shows the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of the nanocomposite, which displays a typical crinkly and ripped morphology. The high-resolution TEM image (Fig. 1d) reveals that layered MoS2 with few layers with an interlayer distance of 0.62 nm is supported on the surface of the GNS, suggesting that the MoS2–GNS nanocomposites have been successfully synthesized.

The resultant MoS2–GNS nanocomposites of 0.25 g were suspended in a 50 mL 1:1 mixture of acetone and ethanol by ultrasonication for 2 h. It can be observed that the nanocomposites can still be suspended in the mixture solution even after one week (Fig. S1, ESI†), which may be ascribed to the partial carboxyl, hydroxyl and epoxy functional groups retained on the GNS surface. Due to the suspension characteristic of the MoS2–GNS nanocomposites, the electrophoretic deposition of the nanocomposites can be conducted on an FTO glass substrate. The evolution in surface morphology before and after the electrophoresis is presented in Fig. S2 (ESI†). From the analysis of energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (Fig. S3, ESI†), C, Mo and S elements can be observed; other signals mainly result from the FTO glass substrate, indicating that MoS2–GNS nanocomposites were successfully deposited onto the FTO glass substrate and serve as the MoS2–GNS CE. Fig. 2a shows the photograph and the UV-vis transmittance spectrum of the MoS2–GNS CE. The UV-visible transmittance spectrum demonstrates that the percentage transmittance of the MoS2–GNS CE can reach over 70% in the wavelength region of 400 to 800 nm, and that a transparent MoS2–GNS CE can thus be produced.

Fig. 2b shows the CVs of the I2/I− system for the GNS, MoS2, MoS2–GNS, and Pt CEs. The Pt CE clearly presents two redox pairs, in which the positive pair is associated with the redox reaction of I2/I3− and the negative pair is ascribed to the redox reaction of I3−/I−. The MoS2 and MoS2–GNS CEs show similar profiles and positions of the two redox pairs compared with the Pt CE, while obvious shifts for the redox peaks are observed for the GNS CE. Generally, the peak separation between the anodic and cathodic peaks, Epp, is inversely associated with the rate of the corresponding redox reaction.24 When compared to the MoS2 and GNS CEs, the Epp for the MoS2–GNS CE becomes relatively lower. This is immediately responsible for the lower overpotential losses in the MoS2–GNS CE than those of the MoS2 and GNS CEs. This also signifies that dispersing intrinsically electrocatalytic MoS2 nanoparticles onto the GNS surface leads to a significant enhancement in the electrocatalytic activity for I3− reduction; a result that is therefore favorable for the dye-regeneration process at the photoanode. Fig. 2c shows the photovoltaic performance of DSCs with different CEs measured under an illumination of 100 mW cm−2. The corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. The DSC using the GNS CE exhibits a poor conversion efficiency of 2.68% due to its poor electrocatalytic activity, while the DSC based on the MoS2–GNS CE has an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 773 mV, a short-circuit current (Jsc) of 12.79 mA cm−2, a fill factor (FF) of 0.59, and a cell efficiency (η) of 5.81% (reaching 93% of that of the DSC using Pt CE (6.24%)). When compared with the MoS2 and GNS CEs, a significantly enhanced FF value for the MoS2–GNS CE can be observed. Although the cell efficiency of the DSC assembled with the transparent MoS2–GNS CE is slightly lower than that of the recently-reported MoS2–graphene flake composite CE (5.98%),21 the opaque MoS2–graphene flake CE possesses poor transmission characteristics (see Fig. S4, ESI†), which thus limits its application in backside illuminated DSCs. EIS measurements for the symmetrical cells with the aforementioned CEs were carried out to obtain insight into the variance in FF values, with Fig. 2d showing the resultant Nyquist plots. The spectra were simulated to the equivalent circuit illustrated in the inset of Fig. S5 (ESI†), which features the one RC element (namely charge-transfer resistance (Rct) and the constant phase element (CPE), a Warburg impedance (ZN) and a series resistance (Rs)). The Rct of the CE is determined by the first semicircle of the EIS spectra, while the resultant Rct generally corresponds to the electrocatalytic activity of the CE for the I3− reduction.7,12 As is shown in Table 1, the GNS CE displays a much higher Rct, indicating poor electrocatalytic activity (as is also demonstrated by the CV results). When the MoS2 is dispersed on the surface of the GNS, the Rct drops significantly (from 6.24 Ω cm2 to 2.34 Ω cm2), which is even lower than that of the MoS2 CE (3.65 Ω cm2). This can possibly be attributed to the incorporation of the intrinsically high electrocatalytic activity of MoS2 on the highly-electric transport pathway from the GNS.25,26

Nevertheless, the MoS2–GNS CE still possesses a relatively larger sum of Rs and Rct when compared to that using the Pt CE, thus resulting in lower FF and η values.27
In summary, in this study, an optically transparent MoS2–GNS CE was incorporated into a Pt-free DSC for the first time. X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy and a high-resolution TEM confirmed that the MoS2 nanoparticles were successfully dispersed over the GNS surface via a facile one-step hydrothermal method. Then, the transparent MoS2–GNS CE was successfully fabricated via the electrophoresis of MoS2–GNS nanocomposites onto an FTO glass substrate. Extensive electrochemical analyses showed that the MoS2–GNS CE demonstrated Pt-like electrocatalytic activity for I3− reduction due to the synergistic effect of its intrinsically high electrocatalytic activity from MoS2 and facile electron transport from the GNS. The DSC assembled with the transparent MoS2–NGS CE exhibited an impressive photovoltaic conversion efficiency of 5.81% up to 93% of that obtained using the Pt CE. This leads to the conclusion that the MoS2–NGS CE is a promising candidate for application as a highly efficient and low-cost CE material in Pt-free transparent DSCs. Its transparent characteristic provides it with promising potential for power-producing windows or TiO2/Ti foil-supported DSCs. In addition, the facile and low-temperature features of electrophoretic deposition from suspension make it applicable to large-scale flexible substrates.
