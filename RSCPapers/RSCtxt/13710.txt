Introduction
Water is an ideal solvent for biomolecular interactions, recognition and reactions in life, except that water freezing and ice crystal growth are detrimental to cells and tissues.1–3 Nature has evolved elegant adaptations to maintain biological function below the water freezing point, such as some species of Tardigrades (water bears) surviving at temperatures close to absolute zero.4 Water bears primarily rely on cryptobiosis for this, whereby they dehydrate ∼97 wt% cellular water and introduce heat-soluble proteins to shield unwanted intra/inter macromolecular aggregates that disrupt cellular function.4 With increasing environmental temperature, the cryptobiosis could be revived by absorbing water again, simultaneously restoring molecular interactions, cellular activities and life.5 Full replication of this complicated biological process in the lab remains a formidable challenge, yet the major physiochemical principles involved are inspiring for de novo processing of polymer complex materials. For example, it hints at a mechanism, i.e., “water–protein” exchange, for modulating macromolecular complexes in response to extreme temperature changes spanning freezing points.6 In contrast, self-assembly of synthetic polymers was mostly studied upon smaller temperature changes above the solvents' freezing point.7 Freeze-thawing of aqueous polymer solutions serves mainly for drying or ice templating,8,9 but not as an arena to enrich self-assembly pathways and structures. As such, modulated macromolecular self-assembly in response to extreme temperature changes is in demand for achieving unprecedented microstructures and functionality, whereas water bears represent a versatile model of inspiration.
Polyelectrolytes are charged macromolecules playing important roles in both biology and engineering.10 The interaction of oppositely charged polyelectrolytes is crucial for the preparation and properties of many polyelectrolyte complexes (PECs), such as membrane free organelles,11 protein droplets,12 wet adhesives,13–15 membranes,16–18 brushes,19 gels,20 and complex micelles.21 Yet PECs as electrostatically cross-linked materials are normally insoluble and infusible, being notoriously difficult for processing.22 Moreover, electrostatic complexation is diffusion controlled and occurs instantaneously upon collision of polyelectrolyte chains in solution.23,24 This rapid kinetics presents a great challenge for microstructure modulation and stimulates emerging interest in the progressive control of polyelectrolyte complexation,25 such as layer-by-layer (LbL) assembly enabling fine control over PEC microstructures including microparticles, capsules and membranes.25–27 However, LbL assembly is a laborious and time consuming process, involving harmful chemicals for hard template removal when it comes to particle/capsule preparation. Recently, compact PECs and saloplastics emerged as a new route towards processing solid PECs, whereby PEC processability relies on ultracentrifugation and/or the screening of polyelectrolyte complexation by added salts.28–30 We envision that the structure, processing and functionality of PECs could be enriched by coupling the complexation to broader temperature and phase changes such as the dynamic freeze-thaw process. In doing so, the progressive complexation of polyelectrolytes could be rendered autonomous through the combination of interfacial melting and complexation. Yet this has been hardly touched since a delicate synergy of dynamic phase change and responsive complexation is needed for progression control and structural modulation.
This work was inspired by Tardigrades' intriguing ability of regulating macromolecular complexation through adaptive molecular shields during the freeze-thaw process. Here, organic solvents were exploited to dissolve a permanently charged polycation and a weak polyanion whose ionization in organic solvents was effectively shielded. Then the solution was sprayed into liquid nitrogen (artificial cryptobiosis) and thawed in ethanol/ammonia (EtOH/NH3) to revive the polyelectrolyte complexation through the synergy of particle thawing and ammonia diffusion. Robust microparticles with tunable microstructures were obtained, in stark contrast to macroscopic polyelectrolyte gel particles prepared through solution droplet mixing, colloidal-templated assembly, or microfluidic processing.31–35 This facile method is applicable to the preparation of microcapsules, monoliths and porous membranes with improved functionality such as solar thermal seawater desalination. It represents the first trial of translating a part of Tardigrades' cryptobiosis mechanisms for progressive complexation with task-specific functionalities unattainable for conventional PECs.
Experimental section
Materials
Polydiallylammonium chloride (PDDA, Aldrich), average Mw ∼ 400000–500000, 20 wt% in H2O, polyacrylic acid (PAA, Macklin, China), average Mw ∼ 450000 and bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide lithium salt (LiTFSI, purity: 98%, Macklin, China) were used. Calcium chloride dihydrate (CaCl2·2H2O, 99%), sodium carbonate (Na2CO3, 99.8 wt%), ethanol (99.5 wt%) and ammonia water (25 wt%) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Ci., Ltd., China. Multi-walled CNTs with a diameter of 35–60 nm and a length of ca. 30 μm were purchased from Chengdu Institute of Organic Chemistry (China). CNTs were ball-milled at 400 rpm for 6 h, and the length was reduced to 0.3–1 μm.
Preparation of Tardigrade inspired polyelectrolyte complex (Tar-PEC) microparticles
First, PDDA–TFSI was prepared by counter ion exchange. 18.3 g PDDA solution (20 wt% in H2O) was diluted in 200 mL water, and LiTFSI (4.55 g) was dissolved in 200 mL water. The LiTFSI solution was added dropwise into the PDDA solution under stirring. The precipitate was collected by filtration, washed with deionized water, and dried at 80 °C overnight. PDDA–TFSI (2 g) and PAA (0.4 g) were dissolved in the DMSO solvent (80 mL) to obtain a clear solution. In this formulation, the mole ratio of the PDDA repeating unit to the PAA repeating unit is estimated to be 1:1. By using a probe-type ultrasonic nebulizer (Zhenyuan Ultrasonic Equipment Co., Ltd., China, Frequency: 50 kHz, Power: 100 W, and Capacity: 2 L h−1), the PDDA–TFISI/PAA DMSO solution was sprayed and atomized into liquid nitrogen, with the spraying speed controlled using a peristaltic pump (flow rate: 0–15 mL min−1). Then the frozen particles were transferred quickly into EtOH/NH3 solution (pH ∼ 11.2) for 2 h. Afterwards solidified particles were collected and washed with ethanol 3 times.
Preparation of Tar-PEC microcapsules
Spherical CaCO3 microparticles (2–6 μm) were prepared according to the literature.36 PDDA–TFSI (2 g), PAA (0.4 g) and CaCO3 microparticles (0.8 g) were dissolved in the DMSO solvent (80 mL). The solution mixture was sprayed into liquid nitrogen, and thawed in EtOH/NH3 solution as described above. Then CaCO3 particles were removed by 2 M NaOH, and the capsule products were washed with ethanol 3 times.
Preparation of Tar-PEC monoliths
A certain amount of PDDA–TFSI/PAA DMSO solution was added to different shapes of molds, respectively, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and then thawed in the EtOH/NH3 solution (pH ∼ 11.2) at room temperature for 2 h. The as prepared PEC monolith was easily detached from the mold and washed using ethanol 3 times.
Preparation of Tar-PEC hybrid membranes
For the preparation of PDDA–PAA–CNT membranes, 0.1 g CNTs, PDDA–TFSI (2.5 g) and PAA (0.5 g) were dissolved/dispersed in the DMSO solvent (50 mL), then cast onto a glass substrate and the solution turned to frozen particles after immersing the glass substrate into liquid nitrogen and finally allowed to react in the EtOH/NH3 solution (pH ∼ 11.2) at room temperature for 2 h. Afterward, a flexible, freestanding hybrid membrane was obtained. In contrast, equal weights of CNTs were coated onto PVDF membranes. All membranes were washed with ethanol 3 times. The corresponding samples were named: the PDDA–PAA–CNT membrane (PEC–CM), the PDDA–PAA membrane (PEC–M) and the CNT coated PVDF membrane (C–PVDF).
Solar-driven sea water desalination experiments
Seawater steam generation experiments were performed using a lab-made device with a solar light simulator (CEL-S500, Ceaulight). The designed chamber was a 50 mL centrifuge tube loaded with seawater, and a piece of circular membrane (460 mm2) was fixed on the top of the centrifuge tube. The power density of solar light irradiation was controlled at one sun (1 kW m−2). The water mass change was measured using an electronic balance (JA2003, Soptop, Shanghai, China). The surface temperature of the membrane was monitored using an infrared thermal imaging camera (DM-I220, DongMei) connected with an iPad.
Characterization
Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were recorded using a Bruker Vertex 80V spectrometer with a detector at 4 cm−1 resolutions from 600 to 4000 cm−1 and 32 scans per sample. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were conducted on AXIS Ultra DLD equipment. Elemental analysis data were collected from the integrated area of C 1 s, F 1 s, S 2p, O 1 s and N 1 s. Signals with appropriate atomic sensitivity factors were analyzed using XPS software (XPS Peak) for data processing. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi SU8010) was used for morphological characterization. Solar-steam generation was carried out with seawater collected from the South China Sea (salt content: 3.5 wt%). The evaporation efficiency (η) is given by the following equation: (1)where ṁ is the evaporation rate, hLV is the total enthalpy including both heat change and the phase change of liquid to water, Copt stands for the optical concentration, and qi is the nominal solar irradiation (1 kW m−2).
Results and discussion
Materials design for the Tar-PEC
Tardigrades respond to decreasing temperature by translating the stored gene into functional heat-soluble proteins (Fig. 1a, step I),37–39 which replace cellular water and shield intermolecular interactions to prevent protein aggregation.5,40 The water replacement hypothesis posits that hydrogen bonds between water and cellular components are replaced by interactions between heat-soluble proteins and cellular components as cells freeze.41 With increasing temperature and water contact (step II), thawing survival of Tardigrades is achieved by replacing heat soluble proteins with water again.4 This two-step process is fast and efficient for Tardigrades to prevent molecular aggregation and survive the freeze-thaw process. It is noteworthy that the cryptobiosis is more complicated than that described above, but the major principle involved regarding macromolecular interactions is relevant and inspiring for the novel self-assembly of a polyelectrolyte complex.

A two-step procedure was inspired to modulate polyelectrolyte complexation (see Fig. 1b and S1† for the detailed Experimental set-up). First, poly(diallylammonium–bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide) (PDDA–TFSI) and polyacrylic acid (PAA) were dissolved in dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) to form a homogeneous solution in which the PAA deprotonation was effectively depressed due to the relatively low dielectric constant of DMSO,42 while PDDA is a strong polyelectrolyte retaining a high degree of ionization. In contrast, mixing PDDA–Cl with PAA in WATER instead of DMSO results in precipitates, like what was frequently observed for most of the conventional complexation.43 In this regard, the DMSO solvent resembles Tardigrades' heat soluble proteins since both prevent macromolecular aggregation. Second, the PDDA–TFSI/PAA solution was sprayed into liquid nitrogen, and the solidified particles were transferred to the EtOH/NH3 solution (pH ∼ 11.2, T0 = −30 °C). Ammonia will deprotonate COOH groups on PAA chains upon particle thawing (Fig. 1c), which converts PAA from neutral to negative charge and simultaneously triggers its electrostatic complexation with PDDA–TFSI, accompanied by the release of counter ions. As such the particle thawing and ionic crosslinking progress hand-in-hand to stabilize particle shapes, yielding particles with scalable productivity (Fig. 1d–f). Based on SEM observations (Fig. S2a and b†), the average size of the PEC particles is estimated to be ∼8 μm, agreeing well with that obtained with the light scattering experiments (Fig. S2c†). Like most of the conventional PECs, Tar-PEC particles appear amorphous (Fig. S2d†). In contrast, a PDDA–TFSI/PAA solution droplet (without freezing) simply diffuses into the EtOH/NH3 solution and yields uncontrolled precipitates but not particles.
A peak (1610 cm−1) attributed to carboxylate groups (COO−)44 is observed for the PEC particles after being treated with EtOH/NH3 (Fig. 2, red line), which is caused by the deprotonation of PAA (COOH groups) by NH3. Moreover, TFSI anion peaks (1050 cm−1 and 1190 cm−1)42 of the PDDA–TFSI/PDDA blend (Fig. 2, blue line) disappear after EtOH/NH3 treatment, which is in agreement with XPS and elemental analysis results that TFSI anion peaks (Fig. 3a, F 1s, S 2p) disappear after treating the frozen particles with EtOH/NH3. In detail, the content of the fluorine element in PDDA–TFSI/PDDA decreases from 24.8% to 2.6% after the treatment with EtOH/NH3 (Fig. 3b). All this characterization supports the electrostatic complexation between PDDA–TFSI and PAA, since the release of counter-ions is quantitatively associated with polyelectrolyte complexation.42

In situ studies of particle thawing and complexation
The thawing of PDDA–TFSI/PAA frozen particles in EtOH and EtOH/NH3 was recorded in situ using a digital camera (Fig. 4, Movie S1†). Particles immersed in ethanol (without ammonia) thaw and diffuse into surrounding solvents in 120 seconds (Fig. 4a), representing a typical melting/dissolving process with rising temperatures. The particles immersed in the EtOH/NH3 mixed solvent also thaw in the first 120 seconds, while importantly, the particle shape was retained without melting down and dissolving (Fig. 4b). This is supported by the particle's weakly opaque periphery (the region between the white and red dashed lines, r2 in Fig. 4b) which is visible upon closer observation at time intervals such as 30 s and 90 s. The interface of r1 and r2 shifted inward gradually with increasing time, and the thawing step was completed in ∼120 s. Collectively, it is the PDDA–PAA complexation which maintains the particle shape against melting down.
 Fig. 4  (a and b) In situ optical observations of PDDA–TFSI/PAA DMSO frozen particles immersed in EtOH (T0 = −30 °C) and EtOH/NH3 (T0 = −30 °C, pH ∼ 11.2), respectively. Please note: bigger particles were chosen for higher resolution in optical photographs. (c) Dependence of the electrostatic complexation degree (ECD) and Rt/R0 of PDDA–TFSI/PAA particles on the soaking time in the EtOH/NH3 bath (T0 = −30 °C, pH ∼ 11.2). Please note: ECD is defined as MCPDDA/MPDDA, whereby MCPDDA is the amount of PDDA monomer units that have complexation with PAA−NH4+, MPDDA is the total amount of PDDA monomer units. ECD is calculated by the content of TFSI counter ions at varied time (please see Fig. S3† for details). R0 and Rt are particle diameters at the beginning and any immersion time. 
Upon further increasing the time (>120 s), the particle opaqueness gradually increases and the particle sizes decrease (Fig. 4c, blue line). This indicates further polyelectrolyte complexation (Fig. 4c) accompanied by particle shrinking. Indeed, the electrostatic complexation degree of PDDA–PAA particles was found to increase gradually with increasing time (Fig. 4c, black line), in agreement with the proposed mechanism that the complexation was coupled to the thawing and ammonia diffusion.
Structural modulation and stabilities of Tar-PECs
Macroscopic PEC hydrogel beads have been reported by dropping sodium alginate solution droplets into oppositely charged polyelectrolytes and/or calcium cation (Ca2+) solution.32–34 These beads are several millimeters large and their stability was less verified. Sizes of the Tar-PEC particles are in the range of 4–8 μm (Fig. S2†), three magnitudes smaller and they exhibit increasing microporosity upon increasing the temperature of the EtOH/NH3 bath. Both NH3 (Fig. 4a and b) and bath temperature (Fig. S4†) are important for polyelectrolyte complexation and particle structures. When PDDA–TFSI/PAA frozen particles were placed in EtOH/NH3, the kinetics of particle melting, NH3 diffusion, PAA deprotonation and complexation determine particle structures. Indeed, surfaces of PEC particles become rougher upon increasing the temperature of the EtOH/NH3 bath (Fig. 5, S4 and S5†), likely because the particles thaw quicker at higher bath temperatures, thus allowing for the transient fluidity of the particle periphery before its solidification induced by polyelectrolyte complexation. Collectively, the rapid freezing of polymer solution droplets in liquid nitrogen is beneficial for replicating their spherical shape. It is expected that slowing down the freezing kinetics would allow for other shapes of frozen PECs beyond spherical particles, which will be the focus of our future work. In the literature, porous PEC particles were prepared by microfluidic processing31 and layer-by-layer assembly on hard templates.45 These methods necessitate delicate instruments, harsh chemicals and complicated preparation that are hard to scale.46 The facile method discussed here is suited for scale up, as demonstrated by ten-gram scale production of Tar-PEC particles (Fig. 1e). Moreover, PEC saloplastics also allow for the scalable preparation of porous PECs, featuring micron scale pores28,29 bigger than those discovered in Tar-PEC particles.
 Fig. 5  PDDA–PAA Tar-PEC microparticles prepared using the EtOH/NH3 bath (pH ∼ 11.2) with different initial temperatures of −30 °C, 2 °C, 30 °C and 50 °C. 
PDDA–PAA particles retain their spherical shape after being treated with hot water (90 °C), HCl (1 M, 90 °C), NaOH (1 M, 90 °C) and various organic solvents, respectively (Fig. 6). For each test, samples were stirred (1000 rpm, 24 h) at temperature close to the solvent's boiling point, followed by high speed centrifugation (8000 rpm, 10 min). It is seen that the particle shapes were retained in all cases, and particles are reasonably swollen in DMSO which is a good solvent for both the PPDA and PAA polymers. Polyelectrolyte complexes are found to be stable in organic solvents, and the high stability observed here is consistent with their high complexation degree and makes them suitable for application under harsh conditions. In addition, Tar-PEC particles are stable in 1 M NaCl and 3 M NaCl (the last two pictures, Fig. 6), despite that PEC particles appear highly swollen because of the weakening of electrostatic complexation by added salts. As such, the high stability of Tar-PEC particles in water with different pHs is due to their high complexation degree as supported by FT-IR (Fig. 2) and XPS (Fig. 3) characterization.
 Fig. 6  Stabilities of PDDA–PAA PEC particles in various environments; each sample was stirred (1000 rpm, 24 h), immersed in different solvents (water ∼ 90 °C, methanol ∼ 60 °C, ethanol ∼ 70 °C, isopropanol ∼ 70 °C, THF ∼ 60 °C, n-hexane ∼ 60 °C, cyclohexane ∼ 70 °C, DMSO ∼ 90 °C, 1 M NaCl ∼ 30 °C, and 3 M NaCl ∼ 30 °C) for 24 h, and centrifuged (8000 rpm, 10 min). 
Tar-PEC materials beyond particles
The Tar-PEC offers access to more materials such as microcapsules, monoliths and hybrid membranes. Microcapsules were prepared by a similar spraying route, except that calcium carbonate microparticles (Fig. S6†) were pre-dispersed in the PDDA–TFSI/PAA solution and removed after the EtOH/NH3 treatment (Fig. 7a). The microcapsules are tunable by altering the initial temperature of EtOH/NH3, such as dense (−30 °C) and nanoporous (50 °C) structures. This strategy could complement the laborious LbL method to prepare thick capsules in large amounts.47,48

(b) Monolithic PDDA–PAA complexes prepared by freeze-thaw complexation and SEM images of their architectures. (c) PDDA–PAA–CNT complex membrane and SEM images at different magnifications. 
Porous Tar-PEC monoliths with designable shapes were prepared by first freezing the polyelectrolyte solution in a mold, and subsequently immersing it in EtOH/NH3 (Fig. 7b). Porosities ranging from hundreds of nanometers to a few microns can be tailored by altering the polymer concentration. Compared with monoliths prepared by freeze drying and supercritical drying, the Tar-PEC method highlights modulated porosity control and efficient preparation since it is free from the tedious and time-consuming drying process and/or complicated hardware for supercritical drying.49,50
Freestanding PEC hybrid membranes were fabricated by casting the PDDA–TFSI/PAA/CNT solution on a glass plate, followed by freeze-thaw complexation (Fig. 7c). The PDDA–PAA–CNT membrane exhibits fine CNT dispersion and hierarchical pores ranging from hundreds of nanometers to microns. The hybrid PEC membrane was spontaneously assembled without any redundant steps and the pore structure was tailored by altering the polymer concentration (Fig. S7†). Moreover, it is expected that novel materials chemistry, such as nanoparticle growth and mineralization, could be coupled to the Tar-PEC process to prepare composite materials unattainable with the conventional freeze drying process. Collectively, the ability of Tar-PEC in processing porous particles, capsules, and monolithic membranes relies on the synergistic combination of solution processing, freezing, and thawing-actuated complexation that contributes to microstructure control. Unlike colloidal processing, it is a template free, continuous route that is well suited for scalable preparation.
Task-specific functionality of Tar-PEC
As a proof of concept, PEC–CNT porous membranes (PEC–CMs, Fig. 7c) were exploited for solar thermal desalination of seawater (Fig. 8). Under one sunlight irradiation, the water evaporation rate of PEC–CMs (1.55 kg m−2 h−1) is higher than that of pristine PEC membranes without CNTs (PEC–M, 0.93 kg m−2 h−1). While this improvement is reasonably related to CNTs enhancing light absorption, interestingly the water evaporation rate of PEC–CM is higher than that of a CNT film deposited on PVDF supports (C–PVDF). Thin CNT layers suffer from less light reflection on their smooth surfaces,51 leading to a lower solar-energy input efficiency and heat storage capacity.52 In contrast, hierarchically porous PEC–CMs with structured surfaces enhance light absorption and eliminate the convective heat loss through polymer chains.53 As such, the surface temperature and energy efficiency of PEC–CMs (64.2 °C, 82%) are higher than those of C–PVDF (57.5 °C, 71%) under the same conditions (Fig. S8†). In addition, hydrophilic internal micron channels of PEC–CMs facilitate water transportation,54 as seen by the rapid steam vaporing from the membrane surface (Movie S2†). Overall, the combined hydrophilicity and pores provide performances surpassing some of the previously reported materials including carbons, polymers and metallic materials (Fig. 8d and Table S1†).

Conclusions
Complexation of oppositely charged polyelectrolytes is crucial to the preparation and properties of many synthetic materials55–57 and biological assemblies.58–60 The vast majority of complexation in these scenarios occurs at temperatures above zero, and bulk PECs are normally hard to process as a result of insolubility and infusibility. This work represents a paradigm shift of complexation moving from solution phases/interfaces to dynamic solid/solid interfaces spanning solvent freezing temperatures. A polycation was mixed with a weak polyanion in DMSO solution to shield the electrostatic complexation between the two polymers. Subsequently the solution was shaped by means of spraying – freezing and/or molding – freezing, followed by the progressive complexation actuated by the thawing and setting in the ethanol/NH3 solvent. The Tar-PEC strategy allows for the facile preparation of PECs such as porous microparticles/capsules, moldable monoliths, and hybrid membranes with task-specific functionality such as high efficacy solar energy absorption and desalination. To the best of our knowledge, Tar-PEC represents the first trial of exploiting extreme temperature changes for the processing and structural engineering of PECs. It opens the door to macromolecular complexation in broader temperature ranges beyond solvents' freezing points, with more composite materials being envisioned for advanced applications in energy and environmental fields.

 	Fig. 1  Tardigrade inspired polyelectrolyte complexation (Tar-PEC) and materials characterization. (a) Schematic illustration of the Tardigrades' strategy to survive extreme temperatures. Step I: cells dehydrate upon decreasing temperature and heat-soluble proteins come in to shield unwanted macromolecular interaction and prevent detrimental aggregation; step II: water comes in to restore original macromolecular interactions and cellular activities. (b) Schematic illustration of Tar-PEC. Step I: ultrasonic atomization of the PDDA–TFSI/PAA solution in liquid nitrogen to prepare frozen particles; step II: thawing and complexation of frozen particles in EtOH/NH3 (T0 = −30 °C, pH ∼ 11.2). (c) Schematic mechanism of thawing actuated complexation. (d) Optical pictures of frozen PDDA-TFSI/PAA/DMSO microparticles in liquid nitrogen. (e) Tar-PEC microparticles (10 g) after thawing actuated complexation. (f) SEM image of PDDA–PAA microparticles.	 

 	Fig. 2  FTIR spectra of PDDA–TFSI/PAA before and after being treated with EtOH/NH3.	 

 	Fig. 3  (a) XPS and (b) the corresponding element analysis of PDDA–TFSI/PAA before (blend) and after (complex) being treated with EtOH/NH3. Note: F and S elements exist only in TFSI counter anions, and their content was significantly reduced after EtOH/NH3 treatment.	 

 	Fig. 4  (a and b) In situ optical observations of PDDA–TFSI/PAA DMSO frozen particles immersed in EtOH (T0 = −30 °C) and EtOH/NH3 (T0 = −30 °C, pH ∼ 11.2), respectively. Please note: bigger particles were chosen for higher resolution in optical photographs. (c) Dependence of the electrostatic complexation degree (ECD) and Rt/R0 of PDDA–TFSI/PAA particles on the soaking time in the EtOH/NH3 bath (T0 = −30 °C, pH ∼ 11.2). Please note: ECD is defined as MCPDDA/MPDDA, whereby MCPDDA is the amount of PDDA monomer units that have complexation with PAA−NH4+, MPDDA is the total amount of PDDA monomer units. ECD is calculated by the content of TFSI counter ions at varied time (please see Fig. S3† for details). R0 and Rt are particle diameters at the beginning and any immersion time.	 

 	Fig. 5  PDDA–PAA Tar-PEC microparticles prepared using the EtOH/NH3 bath (pH ∼ 11.2) with different initial temperatures of −30 °C, 2 °C, 30 °C and 50 °C.	 

 	Fig. 6  Stabilities of PDDA–PAA PEC particles in various environments; each sample was stirred (1000 rpm, 24 h), immersed in different solvents (water ∼ 90 °C, methanol ∼ 60 °C, ethanol ∼ 70 °C, isopropanol ∼ 70 °C, THF ∼ 60 °C, n-hexane ∼ 60 °C, cyclohexane ∼ 70 °C, DMSO ∼ 90 °C, 1 M NaCl ∼ 30 °C, and 3 M NaCl ∼ 30 °C) for 24 h, and centrifuged (8000 rpm, 10 min).	 

 	Fig. 7  Tar-PEC capsules, monoliths and hybrid membranes. (a) Synthetic diagram of PDDA–PAA complex microcapsules and SEM images of their architecture adjustment. (b) Monolithic PDDA–PAA complexes prepared by freeze-thaw complexation and SEM images of their architectures. (c) PDDA–PAA–CNT complex membrane and SEM images at different magnifications.	 

 	Fig. 8  (a) Schematic illustration of a solar-driven seawater desalination system. (b) Mass changes of different samples during the desalination process under one sunlight irradiation. (c) Evaporation rates and efficiencies for solar energy-driven seawater steam generation under on sunlight irradiation. (d) Comparisons of solar thermal performance with some previous reports.
