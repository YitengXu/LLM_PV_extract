    , Accepted 17th June 2020First published on 17th June 2020AbstractHybrid organic–inorganic perovskites CH3NH3PbX3 (X = I, Cl and Br) have recently been developed as highly efficient materials for optoelectronic applications. However, the mechanisms of their extraordinary performance remain poorly understood. It has been suggested that ferroelectric domains may be responsible for photovoltaic behavior of hybrid perovskites employed in solar cells, but the very existence of ferroelectricity in these materials remains debatable. Furthermore, due to the presence of disordered organic group, the hybrid crystal structure is difficult to determine by conventional diffraction methods and controversial results have been reported. In this work CH3NH3PbCl3 crystals are investigated using polarized light microscopy in the temperature range from 80 to 600 K. It is found that symmetry of the phase appearing after the high-temperature cubic phase upon cooling is orthorhombic but not tetragonal, as believed before. It transforms into another orthorhombic phase at a lower temperature. In both orthorhombic phases twin domains are found and examined under mechanical stress and electric field. The crystal proved to be ferroelastic but not ferroelectric.
Introduction
Tremendous progress has been achieved in the technology of photovoltaic power conversion devices based on organic–inorganic hybrid lead halide perovskites during the past ten years.1–6 However, the nature of the observed extraordinary properties remains debatable. One of the main reasons why the behavior of hybrid perovskites is hard to interpret is the complexity of their crystal structure. Besides heavy metal ions, it contains comparatively light polar molecular cations whose orientation is difficult to determine using traditional diffraction techniques. Meanwhile, the orientation of organic molecules affects the crystal symmetry and has been found to play an essential role in determining the electronic properties responsible for slow carrier recombination and the superior energy conversion efficiency.7 Of particular interest in this respect is the ongoing discussion on the ferroelectricity in methylammonium (MA) halide perovskites, MAPbX3, which may possibly result from the ordering of polar organic molecules.5 Some researchers8 reported ferroelectric properties in MAPbI3, while some others did not confirm these properties.9–12 Domain structures were observed near the surface of MAPbI3 samples using piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM),13–15 transmission electron microscopy16 and optical microscopy in reflected light.17 Those domains were postulated to be ferroelectric,13–15 or argued to be ferroelastic, but not ferroelectric.17 It was recently concluded, that the ferroelectric-like behavior of domains observed in MAPbI3 by PFM originates from experimental artefacts,18,19 but this conclusion has been challenged.20
According to early X-ray diffraction investigations,6 the temperature-driven sequence of phases in all MAPbX3 compounds is similar: the high-temperature phase (α phase) is of cubic perovskite structure (C) with space group Pmm, the low-temperature phase is orthorhombic (O), and a tetragonal (T) structure is located in the temperature interval between the C and O phases. This behavior has been confirmed in many X-ray and neutron diffraction experiments,4,6,21,22 but space groups assigned to the phases have been the subject of controversy. In particular, in the intermediate phase (β phase) of MAPbI3 different authors revealed polar I4cm space group23,24 which allows ferroelectricity or I4/mcm group6,9,25,26 for which ferroelectricity is impossible. Furthermore, recent diffraction studies have suggested that the low-temperature (γ) phase of MAPbI3 adopts a monoclinic (M) rather than O crystal system23 and α phase is tetragonal23,27 or rhombohedral27 with a very small distortion of cubic perovskite cell overlooked in earlier investigations. However, the authors were unable to refine the crystal class of M phase because the studied crystals were heavily twinned. Similar problems arose for MAPbCl3, where recent studies of the α phase revealed a subtle deviation of the observed X-ray diffraction pattern from that predicted for the cubic symmetry and the neutron diffraction features indicating possible ferroelectric-type displacements of Pb ions.27 It was suggested that synchrotron structural investigations are needed to get unambiguous conclusions. In the β phase of MAPbCl3 the tetragonal space group P4/mmm was initially reported,6 however, subsequent diffraction investigations of single crystals21 revealed the superstructure reflections of two types, corresponding to cell doubling and about threefold incommensurate modulation, respectively, along the c-axis. It was concluded that the crystal system seems to be tetragonal with the unit cell containing four formula-units. However, it was difficult to analyze the structure because of significant twinning, and the space group was not assigned. For the low-temperature γ phase of MAPbCl3 the orthorhombic space group P2221 was initially found with perovskite cell doubling along the [001] direction.6 Later neutron and synchrotron X-ray diffraction experiments revealed the space group P21212121 or Pnma22 with cell doubling along all three orthorhombic 〈100〉 directions.
We investigate here the MAPbCl3 crystals by means of optical crystallography, which is known to allow a more accurate determination of the crystal system than diffraction crystallography.28 In contrast to diffraction methods where twin domains complicate the refinement of the crystal structure, optical crystallography employs the domain morphology as a convenient and powerful research tool to resolve the domain structure and phase symmetry. In contrast to previous investigations of domain structure, which has been performed at room temperature in the tetragonal phase of another hybrid lead halide perovskite, MAPbI3, by the methods which only probe the near-surface regions of a crystal (electron microscopy, piezoresponse force microscopy, reflection optical microscopy) we applied transmission polarized light microscopy (PLM), which allows bulk observations at a wide temperature range in different phases.
Results and discussion
Transparent, colorless, rectangular cuboid shaped MAPbCl3 single crystals were grown from solution. Fig. 1(a) demonstrates that X-ray diffraction at room temperature yields a cubic perovskite structure with the space group Pmm and lattice parameter a = 5.684 Å consistent with the previous reports.6,21,27 The temperature dependence of permittivity shown in Fig. 1(b) is similar to that observed in the MAPbCl3 crystals previously.11 Two sharp jumps at 178 and 172 K are related to the transitions from α to β and from β to γ phases, respectively. Upon heating to about 600 K, the crystals became less transparent irreversibly, which indicates the onset of decomposition, consistent with our differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis and the thermal analysis reported previously.29
 Fig. 1  Structural, dielectric, and optical characterizations of CH3NH3PbCl3 crystals. (a) Powder X-ray diffraction pattern obtained at room temperature from ground crystals (black line), the result of refinement with the profile residual factor Rwp = 2.01 (red line) and the difference (line at the bottom of the panel). The inset shows the pattern obtained from the crystal surface, confirming that the grown facets are the {100} crystallographic planes. (b) Temperature dependence of the relative permittivity measured on heating at the frequency of 100 kHz. (c) Temperature dependence of linear birefringence (Δn) measured on (001) oriented crystals on cooling and heating. Distinct Δn values at the same temperature in the β and γ phases correspond to different orientation states (domains). In γ phase these are three principal birefringences. Error bars are calculated from measurements in three or more different crystals. 
Crystal symmetry can be determined by analyzing the positions at which the crystal appears in extinction under polarized light microscope. For ferroelastics and ferroelectrics additional information can be obtained from the orientation of domain walls, as described in ESI,† Section S1 and in Table 1. We find that in the α phase the crystals remain in extinction at any observation direction and any position between crossed polarizers (see ESI,† Section S2), which means that the birefringence is absent, and the symmetry is cubic. Linear birefringence (Δn) appears after cooling the crystal below the temperature of 178 K, i.e. in the β and γ phases. Twin domain structure is often observed in these phases, while single domain crystals can also be obtained. The examples are presented in Fig. 2 and in ESI,† Sections S3 and S4. Different configurations of domains were observed in different specimens and in the same specimen after several cooling–heating runs through phase transitions, but when the temperature varies within the same phase, the domain structure remains unchanged. Such a behavior is typical of ferroelastic (and ferroelectric) crystals.
Table 1 Permissible extinction directions and orientations of ferroelastic domain walls which can be observed by polarizing microscope in the (001) crystal plate after transformation from the cubic prototype mm phase to ferroelastic phases of different symmetries: rhombohedral (R), tetragonal (T), orthorhombic (OP and OS), (monoclinic MA, MB and MC) and triclinic (Tr). δ is the angle between the crossed polarizers and the 〈100〉 directions at which the extinction is observed; the filled circle (●) indicates that domains which are in extinction at any δ angle are possible; the crossed circle (⊕) indicates that regions without extinction at any δ are possible; φ is the permissible angle between a domain wall trace on the crystal surface and the 〈100〉 direction (walls which are not perpendicular to a crystal surface are listed in brackets); angles φ = φi and δ = δi (i = 1, 2,…) may adopt any value, except 0°, 90° and ±45°

 Fig. 2  Examples of domain structure observed with polarizing microscope on (001) oriented CH3NH3PbCl3 crystal plates. (a) Complex domain structure of the β phase in a part of a large crystal which has been polished down to a thickness of t ≈ 0.2 mm. A quarter wavelength plate is superimposed to improve the visibility of domains. (b) and (c) Two domains in the β phase of a small crystal with as-grown faces and t = 0.13 mm. (d) Schematics of domain configuration in the crystal depicted in (b) and (c). The S-wall is highlighted by red and the monoclinically distorted primitive cells in two adjacent domains are shown. (e) and (f) The same crystal as in (a) after cooling into the γ phase. A first-order red plate is superimposed in (e) to distinguish the non-transparent regions (black) and the regions in complete extinction (magenta). No domain walls can be found, and the orientation of the indicatrix axes (determined by a compensator) is the same in all areas, which indicates that the crystal consists of a single ferroelastic domain. The temperature, the directions of crystallographic axes, indicatrix axes and polarizers and the angle δ = 0° (b) and (e) and δ = 45° (c) and (f) between the polarizers and [100] are indicated. Scale bars are 100 μm (a–c) and 500 μm (e) and (f). 

Fig. 1(c) shows the temperature dependences of Δn measured on (001) crystal plates, i.e. the plates having large surfaces parallel to one of the {100} crystallographic planes, so that the observation is performed along the 〈001〉 direction (throughout the article we refer to the crystallographic axes of the parent cubic phase). Abrupt variations of birefringence are observed at the α–β and β–γ phase transitions with temperature hysteresis between cooling and heating runs of 0.9 K and 1.1 K, respectively. The discontinued changes and the thermal hysteresis unambiguously suggest that both transitions are of the first order.
The domain structure typical of the β phase in large crystals is demonstrated in Fig. 2(a). The domain walls are visible in the form of lines extending along [100] and [010], i.e. the intersections of walls with the crystal surface form angles of φ = 0° or φ = 90° to the 〈100〉 directions, which is possible in any phase, according to Table 1. The distance between the parallel walls (domain thickness) is 4–20 μm. In some regions a cross-hatched microstructure (‘tweed pattern’) and comb pattern at the intersection of two bundles of mutually perpendicular domain strips are observed. Such motifs are characteristic of ferroelastic domains.30
Another example of domain structure in the β phase is shown in Fig. 2(b) and (c). Two large domains are visible with complete extinctions at δ = 0° and δ = 45°, respectively. According to Table 1, only in orthorhombic OS phase such two extinction positions are possible simultaneously (OS stands for the orthorhombic phase in which one of the twofold symmetry axes is along the face diagonal of the parent cubic cell; see ESI,† Section 1 for more details). Note also the different colors of these domains and the region between the domains which reveals parallel bands of variable colors with a sequence that matches the sequence of low-order interference colors in the Michel–Levi chart.28 This multicolor region is due to the wedges formed by the inclined domain wall and the surfaces of the crystal plate, as schematically demonstrated in Fig. 2(d). The angle φ is found to be 34°. The walls having an angle φ other than 0°, 45° or 90° are called S-walls. According to Table 1, they are not possible in T phase, but allowed in the OS phase. Additional examples of domain structures on the (001), (110) and (111)-oriented plates, which are consistent with the OS symmetry of the β phase, are provided in ESI,† Section S3.
One can determine from the Michel–Levi chart that the color of the lower domain corresponds to the second-order yellowish green interference color which is produced by optical retardation of Δ ≈ 880 nm. The value of Δ ≈ 300 nm corresponds to the first-order yellow of the upper domain. The effective birefringence calculated as Δn = Δ/t (where t = 0.13 mm is the crystal thickness) appears to be Δn1 = 0.007 and Δn2 = 0.002 for lower and upper domains, respectively, in agreement with the values reported in Fig. 1(c).
Tetragonal and rhombohedral crystals are uniaxial, and all domains of these crystals should have the same effective birefringence when observed in (001) plate. In contrast, different sections of the optical indicatrix can be seen under the microscope in different domains of biaxial orthorhombic crystals and the values of Δn can be different. Therefore, the extinction positions, the domain wall directions and different birefringence values in different domains indicate that the β phase of MAPbCl3 crystal is not tetragonal, as previously believed based on diffraction data, and the only phase compatible with the crystal optical characteristics observed by PLM is the orthorhombic OS.
From the wall angle φ = 34° the monoclinic angle of distorted primitive cell can be calculated. The orientations of S-walls are related to lattice parameters through the relative spontaneous strain tensor. For the orientation state of OS phase in which the b axis is parallel to the x axis of the orthogonal x, y, z system (i.e. for the upper domain in Fig. 2(d)), this tensor can be written as31 (1)The components are defined as S = (a − b) (2a + b)−1 and 2R = 0.5π − β, where a, b and β are the parameters of the monoclinically distorted primitive cell. The equation of the S-wall between two orientation states depicted in Fig. 2d is given as follows:31 3S(x − z) = 2Ry.(2)The angle φ can be determined from this equation through the relation 3Scotφ = 2R and the monoclinic angle can be found as: (3)Considering the reported21 lattice parameters of pseudotetragonal superstructure: aT = 11.290(16) Å, bT = 11.290(4) Å and cT = 11.303(9) Å and making an evident choice of a = 0.5aT, and b = 0.5cT, we find from the last equation that β = 90°6′. Such a small deviation from the right angle had been overlooked in X-ray and neutron diffraction experiments and analysis and therefore, the tetragonal system was erroneously assigned. Taking into account the necessary doubling of lattice parameters due to superstructure (which cannot be verified by means of PLM), the parameters of the conventional orthorhombic cell can be estimated as , , and cO = 2b = 11.303 Å. Note that the difference aO − bO = 0.027 Å is very small and equals approximately the uncertainty of lattice parameter determination in the diffraction experiments21 and that the possible incommensurate structural modulation reported in the β phase with X-ray diffraction21 is not accessible in the PLM observations.
Domains in the γ phase are usually larger than in the β phase, and single-domain states are often observed even in comparatively large specimens, such as the crystal shown in Fig. 2(e) and (f). The complete extinction is observed in this crystal at δ = 0°/90°, as expected (see Table 1) in all orientation states of OP phase and in some orientation states of T, OS and MC phases (OP stands for the ferroelastic orthorhombic phase in which all twofold symmetry axes are along one of the crystallographic axes of the parent C phase; for the definition of MC phase, see ESI,† Section S1). However, the uniaxial T phase should be excluded because the domains with three different Δn were found in the (001) plates (see Fig. 1(c) and ESI,† Section S5 for details). Furthermore, in all these domains the extinction at δ = 0°/90° is found, which excludes the MC phase. We conclude, therefore, that the γ phase has the OP structure, which is in agreement with the previous diffraction studies.4,6,21 Examples of domain structures observed on the (111) crystal in the γ are demonstrated in ESI,† Section S4.
Ferroelastics are defined as crystals in which an external stress can transform (“switch”) one crystallographic orientation (spontaneous strain) state into another. In practice the transformation occurs via the displacement of walls separating ferroelastic domains. The wall displacement implies that the near-wall regions are switched. Therefore, to prove the ferroelastic nature of twin domains, a significant stress-induced rearrangement of domain structure should be demonstrated. Uniaxial stress was applied in our experiments in the direction perpendicular to the major crystal face (i.e. parallel to the optical axis of the microscope). Fig. 3(a–d) shows that in the β and γ phases an external stress changes the domain structure, confirming that both phases are ferroelastic.

(a–d) Photographs of (001) plate under polarizing microscope in the β phase (a) and (b) and γ phase (c) and (d); with a uniaxial stress applied along [001] (b) and (d) and without stress (a) and (c). A first-order red plate is superimposed to improve the visibility of domains. Crystal thickness = 0.25 mm; scale bars = 100 μm. 
In ferroelectric perovskite crystals two types of ferroelectric domains can be expected: 180° domains (which are non-ferroelastic) and non-180° domains (which always reside with ferroelastic twin domains due to coupling between lattice polarization and strain). If a crystal is not only ferroelastic, but also ferroelectric, all domains should be switchable by an external electric field (by the definition of ferroelectricity). In our experiments a field of up to 15 kV cm−1 was applied. When a comparatively large field was applied for a long time (several minutes), the specimen became less transparent, but the birefringence did not change, and no variations of domain wall positions were noticed. This behaviour is evidenced in Fig. 4, which demonstrates that in both the β and γ phases the domain structure before [Fig. 4(a) and (c)] and after [Fig. 4(b) and (d)] application of electric field is exactly the same. Therefore, MAPbCl3 is not ferroelectric and the observed domains are ferroelastic twins.

(a–d) Photographs of (001) plate under polarizing microscope in the β phase (a) and (b) and γ phase (c) and (d); without electric field (a) and (c) and with an electric field of 15 kV cm−1 applied along [100] (b) and (d). A first-order red plate is superimposed to improve the visibility of domains. Crystal thickness = 0.2 mm; scale bars = 100 μm. 
An additional test for ferroelectricity consists in the measurements of phase transition temperatures under electric field. They were determined as the temperatures where the domain structure changes on heating or cooling. The temperature of transition from ferro- to paraelectric phase should increase under external electric field and the transition temperature between two ferroelectric phases also may change. However, the transition temperatures are found to be independent of the applied electric field (see Fig. S6, ESI†), which confirms that MAPbCl3 is not ferroelectric.
Experimental
Growth of CH3NH3PbCl3 crystals
Two salts, CH3NH3Cl and PbCl2, were first dissolved into DMSO by stirring at 60 °C for 2 hours to obtain a 2[M] homogenous solution. After that, the solution was cooled down to 25 °C and kept at room temperature for several days. Highly transparent, colourless crystals were grown with well-defined rectangular habits compatible with the cubic symmetry with the dimensions from several micrometres to several millimetres, depending on the crystal growth time.
Powder X-ray diffraction
Crystal structure and phase purity were verified by a Rigaku Rapid Axis Diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation in the Bragg–Brentano reflection geometry. Structural refinement was performed by the Pawley method using TOPAS software package.
Polarized light microscopy (PLM)
Crystals of various sizes were selected for examination, including thin (∼0.1 mm) plates and larger specimens. The crystallographic orientation of the crystals was confirmed using specular diffraction from the surface of crystals, as shown in the inset of Fig. 1(a), which is consistent with the rectangular morphology of the {100}cub as-grown faces. To prepare thin platelets with large faces parallel to (001), (011) and (111) crystallographic planes, respectively, suitable for optical examination, large crystals were thinned and mirror polished; as-grown (001) plates were also studied provided they were thin enough. An Olympus BX60 polarizing microscope equipped with a first order red plate (530 nm), a quarter wavelength retardation plate (137 nm) and a Linkam HTMS600 heating/cooling stage was used for investigations in the temperature range of 80–600 K. Birefringence was measured using Berek compensators of Olympus U-CBE and U-CTB. Single-domain crystals or large domains in poly-domain crystals were selected for measurements that were carried out at temperatures stabilized in the course of slow (∼1 K min−1) heating and cooling. To apply uniaxial stress the crystal was placed between two quartz coverslips and the top coverslip was pressed. To apply an electric field two parallel stripes of gold were deposited on one of the large (001) faces of the crystal plate by sputtering. The stripes were used as electrodes being connected to a high voltage source by gold wires.
Dielectric measurements
The dielectric permittivity was measured using an impedance analyzer (Novocontrol Turnkey Dielectric Spectrometer, Concept 40) at a measurement frequency of 100 kHz and a field strength of about 5 V mm−1. Opposite (100) faces of the crystal plate were covered with silver paste to form electrodes which were connected to the spectrometer by gold wires. The data were collected upon heating at the rate of 0.5 K min−1.
Conclusions
In summary, we perform a comprehensive study of hybrid perovskite crystals by means of polarized light microscopy, which examine not only near-surface regions, like other techniques previously used to investigate the domain structure in MAPbI3, but also the bulk properties of the crystals. We find ferroelastic twin domains in MAPbCl3 and show unambiguously that this material is not ferroelectric. This suggests that even if ferroelectricity really existed in other hybrid lead halide perovskites, it might not play a major role in the appearance of their extraordinary optoelectronic properties. We also resolve the ambiguity regarding the crystal structure of MAPbCl3 and find that the intermediate phase that was postulated to be tetragonal is of orthorhombic symmetry. Upon cooling the crystal transforms from the cubic α phase, to orthorhombic (OS) β phase and then to the orthorhombic (OP) γ phase. The domain structure of the orthorhombic β phase is characterized by the presence of S-wall. This finding will be helpful in determining more accurately the arrangement of methylammonium molecules in the halide perovskite crystal structure, which is inaccessible by diffraction methods, but is of relevance to the macroscopic symmetry and crystal physical properties.

 	Fig. 1  Structural, dielectric, and optical characterizations of CH3NH3PbCl3 crystals. (a) Powder X-ray diffraction pattern obtained at room temperature from ground crystals (black line), the result of refinement with the profile residual factor Rwp = 2.01 (red line) and the difference (line at the bottom of the panel). The inset shows the pattern obtained from the crystal surface, confirming that the grown facets are the {100} crystallographic planes. (b) Temperature dependence of the relative permittivity measured on heating at the frequency of 100 kHz. (c) Temperature dependence of linear birefringence (Δn) measured on (001) oriented crystals on cooling and heating. Distinct Δn values at the same temperature in the β and γ phases correspond to different orientation states (domains). In γ phase these are three principal birefringences. Error bars are calculated from measurements in three or more different crystals.

 	Fig. 2  Examples of domain structure observed with polarizing microscope on (001) oriented CH3NH3PbCl3 crystal plates. (a) Complex domain structure of the β phase in a part of a large crystal which has been polished down to a thickness of t ≈ 0.2 mm. A quarter wavelength plate is superimposed to improve the visibility of domains. (b) and (c) Two domains in the β phase of a small crystal with as-grown faces and t = 0.13 mm. (d) Schematics of domain configuration in the crystal depicted in (b) and (c). The S-wall is highlighted by red and the monoclinically distorted primitive cells in two adjacent domains are shown. (e) and (f) The same crystal as in (a) after cooling into the γ phase. A first-order red plate is superimposed in (e) to distinguish the non-transparent regions (black) and the regions in complete extinction (magenta). No domain walls can be found, and the orientation of the indicatrix axes (determined by a compensator) is the same in all areas, which indicates that the crystal consists of a single ferroelastic domain. The temperature, the directions of crystallographic axes, indicatrix axes and polarizers and the angle δ = 0° (b) and (e) and δ = 45° (c) and (f) between the polarizers and [100] are indicated. Scale bars are 100 μm (a–c) and 500 μm (e) and (f).

 	Fig. 3  Verification of ferroelastic nature of twin domains observed on CH3NH3PbCl3 crystals. (a–d) Photographs of (001) plate under polarizing microscope in the β phase (a) and (b) and γ phase (c) and (d); with a uniaxial stress applied along [001] (b) and (d) and without stress (a) and (c). A first-order red plate is superimposed to improve the visibility of domains. Crystal thickness = 0.25 mm; scale bars = 100 μm.	 

 	Fig. 4  Verification of ferroelectric nature of domains observed on CH3NH3PbCl3 crystals. (a–d) Photographs of (001) plate under polarizing microscope in the β phase (a) and (b) and γ phase (c) and (d); without electric field (a) and (c) and with an electric field of 15 kV cm−1 applied along [100] (b) and (d). A first-order red plate is superimposed to improve the visibility of domains. Crystal thickness = 0.2 mm; scale bars = 100 μm.
