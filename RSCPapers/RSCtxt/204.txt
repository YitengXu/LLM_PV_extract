    , Accepted 24th January 2019First published on 25th January 2019AbstractIn this study, by incorporating imide-fused benzothiadiazole (BIBT) as the electron-withdrawing core unit, for the first time we designed and synthesized a novel A1–D–A2–D–A1 type small molecule acceptor denoted BIBT-NI for organic solar cell (OSC) applications. Its thermal, optical and electrochemical properties were thoroughly investigated. Density functional theory was also applied to shed light on the molecular configuration and energy level distribution of the acceptor. This molecule exhibited a strong absorption spectrum in the range of 420–550 nm together with an optical bandgap of 2.04 eV. The inverted OSC devices based on BIBT-NI as an electron-acceptor combined with the classical polymer poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) as an electron-donor afforded an optimal power conversion efficiency of 2.11% with a comparatively high open-circuit voltage of 0.78 V. These results underscore the promising potential of BIBT as an electron-deficient building block in constructing nonfullerene acceptors for OSCs.
1. Introduction
Bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs) consisting of a blend of electron-donors and electron-acceptors in the active layers have aroused enormous interest in both academia and industry, due to their advantages of being light weight, flexible and easily fabricated using a roll-to-roll method.1 In the past development of BHJ OSCs, fullerene derived acceptors such as [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) and [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) have long played a dominant role, based on which the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) have already been above 11%.2 However, because of the characteristics of weak absorption in the visible and near-infrared regions as well as limited tunability of energy levels,3 it is difficult for fullerene-based OSCs to achieve higher photovoltaic performance optimization. Therefore, the exploration of alternative non-fullerene acceptors is urgently needed and has become a current research focus.
In this context, during the past few years, various n-type organic/polymer semiconductors serving as electron-acceptors have been designed and synthesized,4 leading to the rapid development of non-fullerene OSCs with PCEs of more than 13% obtained.5 Among these, the electron-withdrawing 1,8-naphthalimide (NI) building block has gained significant attention in developing novel electron-accepting materials, owing to its high electron affinity and good solubility benefiting from its straightforward alkylation on nitrogen atoms within the imide unit.6 For example, Park et al. reported a series of dicyanodistyrylbenzene-based non-fullerene acceptors with the self-assembly tendencies modulated by incorporating a NI moiety into the terminal position of the molecules, which exhibited a maximum PCE of 2.71% when combined with poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) as the electron-donor.7 Aso and coworkers prepared a non-fullerene acceptor through incorporating the naphtho[1,2-c:5,6-c′]bis[1,2,5]thiadiazole unit into a di-naphthalimide system. By using P3HT as the donor, the OSC devices showed a PCE of 2.81%.8 Sonar et al. synthesized a series of small molecule non-fullerene acceptors based on NI and 9-fluorenone that exhibited a PCE of 3.6% when blended with P3HT.9 In view of these impressive results, we are particularly interested in further exploring the potential of NI-based electron-acceptors for OSCs.
Moreover, in an attempt to pair with large-scale commercial P3HT donor polymers, many other electron-deficient building blocks besides NI, including benzothiadiazole (BT), benzotriazole (BTA) and diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP), have been utilized to construct non-fullerene acceptors for P3HT-based solar cells with impressive photovoltaic performance.10 McCulloch et al. designed and synthesized a small electron acceptor O-IDTBR consisting of an indacenodithiophene (IDT) core flanked by BT and 3-ethylrhodamine units, which yielded a PCE of up to 6.4% when coupled with P3HT.11 Similarly, Zhou et al. prepared two BT-containing non-fullerene acceptors, but with terminal groups of thiazolidine-2,4-dione instead of rhodamine, for P3HT-based OSCs that showed a PCE of 6.08%.12 Furthermore, Zhou's research team developed a BTA-containing small molecule electron-acceptor (BTA1 for short) with an A2A1DA1A2 linear molecular structure. By blending this acceptor with P3HT, the fabricated solar cell devices afforded a PCE of 5.24% with a high open-circuit voltage of 1.02 V.13 Huang and coworkers synthesized two thiazole bridged small molecular acceptors with an A–π–D–π–A type structure for P3HT donor materials. Upon optimizing the side chains of the central D unit, the resulting solar cell devices could achieve a maximum PCE of 5.01%.14 Very recently, the same group reported another new nonfullerene acceptor ORCN via introducing alkoxy side chains for P3HT-based OSCs with a high PCE of 6.6%.15 Despite these significant advances being made, however, to access the commercialization of P3HT-based OSCs, further improvement of PCEs with focus on designing new acceptors to match well with P3HT is still urgently needed.
Currently, one of the promising strategies towards the construction of electron-acceptors is to utilize an acceptor–donor–acceptor–donor–acceptor (A1–D–A2–D–A1) framework (where A1 and A2 have different electron affinities) in the backbone.16 Such a structure enables the electronic energy levels and band gaps to be easily tuned by varying the terminal and/or core electron acceptor units.17 It was also noted that imide-fused benzothiadiazole (BIBT) as a favorable electron-deficient unit is typically used to construct D–A type donor polymers for highly efficient fullerene-based OSCs,18 but its potential utility in electron-acceptors has not been explored yet. In this contribution, for the first time we designed and synthesized a BIBT-functionalized electron-acceptor of BIBT-NI with an A1–D–A2–D–A1 configuration (see Scheme 1 for its chemical structure). Here the building block of BIBT served as the central electron-withdrawing core (A2), and the NI groups were attached as the terminal units (A1) in combination with the donor thiophene units inserted as the π-bridge linkers (D). The photophysical and electrochemical properties of BIBT-NI were thoroughly investigated. To evaluate the photovoltaic performance of this small molecule acceptor, inverted solar cell devices were fabricated by using the P3HT polymer as an electron-donor. Consequently, a moderate PCE of 2.11% was achieved with a relatively high open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.78 V, demonstrating that BIBT is a promising electron-deficient unit toward constructing nonfullerene acceptors for OSCs.

2. Results and discussion
2.1. Synthesis and characterization
The synthetic route for the small molecule BIBT-NI is outlined in Scheme 1 and the ESI† describes in detail the synthetic procedures and characterization. Compounds N-(2-ethylhexyl)-4,7-di(thien-2-yl)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole-5,6-dicarboxylic imide (5) and 6-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)-2-(2-ethylhexyl)-1H-benzo[de]isoquinoline-1,3(2H)-dione (3′) were synthesized according to the methods reported previously.19 The bromination of compound 5 by using N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) in chloroform (CF) along with glacial acetic acid afforded compound 6. The target small molecule BIBT-NI was synthesized through a typical Suzuki coupling reaction between 6 and 3′, using Pd(PPh3)4 as the catalyst and tetrahydrofuran (THF) as the solvent. The molecular structure of BIBT-NI was verified by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy as shown in Fig. S1, ESI.†BIBT-NI was found to be highly soluble in many types of organic solvents such as CF, toluene, THF and chlorobenzene (CB). In addition, BIBT-NI exhibits excellent thermal stability with 5% weight loss at a decomposition temperature of 431 °C, as determined by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) under a nitrogen atmosphere (Fig. S2, ESI†).

          2.2.
         Optical and electrochemical properties
The ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) normalized spectral absorptions of BIBT-NI measured in diluted chloroform solution and in thin films are represented in Fig. 1b. Both film and solution spectra of BIBT-NI exhibited two well-defined absorption peaks, which can be attributed to the π–π* transition and intramolecular charge transfer transition, respectively. In solution, BIBT-NI displayed an absorption maximum at 469 nm. In comparison, in the thin films, BIBT-NI displayed an obviously redshifted maximum absorption peak located at 503 nm, which indicated that a stronger intermolecular interaction occurred in the condensed solid state. From the low-energy onset of thin film absorption, the optical band-gap of BIBT-NI was calculated to be 2.04 eV. Additionally, BIBT-NI and P3HT provide overlapped and complementary absorption spectra ranging from 350 to 650 nm, which is in favour of sunlight harvesting in non-fullerene OSC devices.

To investigate the electrochemical properties of BIBT-NI, cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were performed in an anhydrous and nitrogen-saturated acetonitrile solution with 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6) as the supporting electrolyte. As displayed in Fig. S3 in the ESI,† the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level (EHOMO) of BIBT-NI was calculated to be −5.62 eV from the oxidation onset potential (Eox) and also, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level (ELUMO) was −3.65 eV as estimated by the reduction onset potential (Ered), according to the empirical equations: EHOMO = −e(Eox + 4.80) (eV) and ELUMO = −e(Ered + 4.80) (eV). Note that BIBT-NI possesses a relatively high-lying LUMO energy level, which implies that a large Voc can be expected in the corresponding OSC devices. Furthermore, as seen from Fig. 1c, the LUMO and HOMO energy differences between BIBT-NI and P3HT13 are both larger than 0.3 eV, which provides sufficient driving force for efficient exciton dissociation, indicating that P3HT can be a suitable polymer donor to match with BIBT-NI.
2.3. Theoretical calculations
Theoretical calculations by density functional theory (DFT) using Gaussian at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level of theory were carried out to gain a deep insight into the geometric and electronic properties of BIBT-NI in the ground state.20 To optimize the computational cost, we replaced all the long side chains of 2-ethylhexyl by a methyl group. As shown in Fig. 2, the electron density of the HOMO energy level is delocalized along the entire backbone, while the electron density of the LUMO energy level is mainly distributed on the central imide-fused benzothiadiazole acceptor unit, indicating the efficient intramolecular charge transfer interactions for the small molecule. The computational results show that the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of BIBT-NI were −6.06 and −3.78 eV, respectively. The calculated HOMO−LUMO value of the new compound is 2.28 eV, which is qualitatively consistent with the experimental value as estimated from the cyclic voltammetry measurements. Additionally, the small molecule exhibits a rather distorted configuration between the thiophene ring and the central building block BIBT with a dihedral angle of 48.2°, which would weaken the π–π interactions if the geometry were preserved in the solid state.

2.4. Photovoltaic properties
To demonstrate the potential applications of BIBT-NI in OSCs as an electron acceptor, organic photovoltaic devices were fabricated with an inverted architecture of ITO/ZnO/active layer/MoO3/Al. The typical polymer P3HT was chosen as the donor material. Note that the photoactive layers were spin-coated from o-dichlorobenzene solution and the thickness of the active layers was around 90 nm. The weight ratio of P3HT to BIBT-NI within the active layers was delicately adjusted to investigate their effects on the device performance. The typical current density–voltage (J–V) curves measured under the Air Mass 1.5 Global (AM 1.5 G) illumination of 100 mW cm−2 from a solar simulator are exhibited in Fig. 3a. The corresponding photovoltaic parameters, including Voc, short-circuit current density (Jsc), fill factor (FF) and PCE, estimated from the J–V curves are summarized in Table 1.

As shown in Table 1, upon increasing the amount of BIBT-NI in the active layers, the PCEs increased first, and then decreased. The optimal results were achieved at a 1:1.2 ratio of P3HT:BIBT-NI by weight, and the devices exhibited a moderate PCE of 1.46% with a relatively high Voc of 0.82 V, a Jsc of 4.35 mA cm−2, and a FF of 41.0%. To improve the device performance, the photoactive layers were subjected to thermal annealing treatment. It can be seen that after 10 min annealing at 110 °C the Jsc and FF values increased to 6.18 mA cm−2 and 43.7%, respectively, while the Voc value decreased slightly down to 0.78 V. Overall, an enhanced PCE of 2.11% was obtained. The increased Jsc and FF values may be ascribed to the enhanced charge transport mobility in P3HT:BIBT-NI devices and improved morphology of the thermally annealed blending film, which will be discussed later. Further optimization was tried to incorporate the solvent additive 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) with a volume ratio of 1% (v/v) in the o-dichlorobenzene solution of P3HT:BIBT-NI (w/w, 1:1.2). The corresponding photovoltaic performances are summarized in Table S1 in the ESI.† Unexpectedly, it was observed that the solvent additive leads to decreased PCEs in terms of lower Voc and Jsc for both as-cast and thermally annealed devices.
To gain insight into the exciton dissociation and charge transfer behavior in the blend, photoluminescence (PL) spectra of pure P3HT and BIBT-NI along with their blend films under optimal photovoltaic conditions were measured (see Fig. S5 in the ESI†). When excited at a wavelength of 503 nm, the PL intensity of the blend film was obviously quenched with respect to the pure P3HT film. Nevertheless, the relatively weak PL quenching indicated inefficient electron transfer from P3HT to BIBT-NI for the excitons generated in the P3HT phase, which was likely to be blamed for the low Jsc in the resulting solar cell devices. For the BIBT-NI acceptor excited at 496 nm, its emission ranged from 550 nm to 850 nm with a peak at 652 nm. By contrast, the P3HT:BIBT-NI blend film showed a negligible emission peak with a quenching efficiency of over 90%, implying effective hole transfer from BIBT-BI to P3HT for the excitons generated in the acceptor phase.
In addition, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurement of the best device with photoactive layers thermally annealed at 110 °C was also carried out to evaluate the Jsc value of the optimized device. As displayed in Fig. 3b, the device exhibited a photo-to-current response from 330 to 650 nm with a maximum EQE value of 39.19% at 500 nm recorded. Note that the photocurrent response is consistent with the UV-Vis absorption spectra of the blend film (see Fig. 1b), indicating that the photon-harvesting of both P3HT and BIBT-NI contributes to photo-generated current. The calculated Jsc value from the integration of the EQE curve is quite similar to the Jsc value obtained from J–V measurements.
2.5. Space charge limited current charge mobility
To better understand the observed variation as to the photovoltaic properties, here we applied the space charge limited current (SCLC) method to evaluate the charge carrier mobility of the P3HT:BIBT-NI (1:1.2) blend film. An electron-only device with a configuration of ITO/ZnO/active layer/Ca/Al and a hole-only device with a configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/MoO3/Al were fabricated to measure the electron and hole mobilities, respectively. The resulting J1/2–V characteristics are depicted in Fig. 4. According to the Mott–Gurney law, the electron and hole mobilities of the as-cast active layer were calculated to be 1.32 × 10−6 and 2.11 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. After thermal annealing treatment, the blend film delivered a significantly increased electron mobility of 3.34 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1 and hole mobility of 4.19 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. The higher charge carrier mobility in the annealed blend films could respond to the improved Jsc and FF. Besides, it can be seen that BIBT-NI presents a relatively low electron mobility on the order of 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is reduced by two orders of magnitude compared to the corresponding hole mobility. The unbalanced charge transport in the active layer should be partially responsible for the low Jsc and FF values of the devices based on the BIBT-NI acceptor.

2.6. Active layer morphology
Since the active layer film morphology plays a prominent role in determining the performance of PSCs, the morphological properties of the P3HT:BIBT-NI blend film were investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM) in a tapping-mode. As shown in Fig. 5, it is obvious that the as-cast blend film exhibits a smooth surface morphology with a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 0.83 nm. No clear phase separation can be discerned within the as-cast blend. In contrast, after thermal annealing at 110 °C for 10 min, a well-defined morphology arises (Fig. 5b) along with slightly improved roughness (RMS = 1.01 nm). We suspected that the thermally annealed film surface with higher RMS roughness and nano-scaled texture might increase the contact area between the active layer and interfacial electrode, which could benefit exciton separation and charge transport thereby improving the charge collection.21 This can be evidenced by both increased hole and electron mobilities, as well as improved Jsc and FF values for the thermally annealed devices.

3. Conclusions
In conclusion, we have developed a new A1–D–A2–D–A1 type nonfullerene acceptor BIBT-NI by integrating BIBT as a central electron-deficient core unit and NI as a terminal moiety. The small molecule acceptor possesses a wide optical bandgap of 2.04 eV along with appropriate energy levels matching with those of the standard donor polymer P3HT. Inverted non-fullerene OSC devices based on P3HT:BIBT-NI exhibited a moderate PCE of 2.11% with a relatively high Voc of 0.78 V, a Jsc of 6.18 mA cm−2 and a FF of 43.7%. The relatively low Jsc and FF could be ascribed to the unbalanced hole and electron transport in the active layer. Our preliminary investigation highlights the promising potential of BIBT as an electron-deficient unit in constructing nonfullerene electron-acceptors with high-performance. Further molecular engineering to tune the photophysical and charge carrier transportation properties of BIBT-derived acceptors is currently underway, and the results will be reported in due course.
