    , Accepted 17th August 2012First published on 17th August 2012AbstractAnatase TiO2 microplates with hexagonal shape were synthesized by a hydrothermal method in water–ethanol solvent. The single-crystalline TiO2 microplate film exhibited high reflectance in the visible region due to the unique planar morphology. When used as the scattering overlayer in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs), such microplates effectively enhanced light harvesting and led to the increase of the photocurrent of the DSCs. As a result, a 16.3% improvement in conversion efficiency was achieved after introducing the TiO2 microplate scattering layer (7.91%), which also surpassed the commercial scattering overlayer. The comparative experiments between the microplates and TiO2 microrods further confirmed that such a planar morphology is more beneficial to light scattering and photovoltaic performance. The excellent light-scattering properties of plate-like TiO2 make it a promising candidate as a scattering material for DSCs.
Introduction
Among solar-powered devices, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) have attracted special interest due to their low cost and high efficiency.1–3 To activate DSCs, the first and key step is to efficiently harvest sunlight using the dyes attached to the semiconductor (generally TiO2) surface.2 Therefore, it is crucial to improve light harvesting or absorbance within the solar cells in order to enhance the sunlight-to-electricity conversion efficiency. In this case, much effort has been made to develop new dyes with high absorption coefficients and with broad absorption spectra matching to the solar spectrum.4–7 Co-sensitization by mixing two or more complementary dyes has also been demonstrated to increase the light absorption by broadening the spectral response.8,9
Aside from the above methods, another effective route to improve light harvesting is to lengthen optical pathway within the photoanode by efficient light scattering/reflecting and thus enhance the probability of photon absorption.10 The earliest exploited constructions are to add large diffusive particles into the nanocrystalline TiO2 matrix or on top of the nanocrystalline layer. The effect of the size and content of scattering particles on light scattering and DSC conversion efficiency were inclusively investigated both theoretically and experimentally.10–13 It has been demonstrated that large scattering particles of 100–500 nm can effectively enhance light harvesting and improve photovoltaic conversion efficiency.12,14–17 In recent years, much attention has been paid to developing TiO2 microspheres composed of nanoparticles, aiming to provide both high surface area and light scattering.18–22 Such TiO2 microspheres have sub-micrometer or micrometer sizes and thus induce light scattering, while the nano-sized building units provide more available surface for dye loading. Unfortunately, a large quantity of electron traps caused by the increased surface defects and grain interfaces of nanoparticle units may act as recombination centers to impede the electron diffusion.23 Moreover, these TiO2 microspheres exhibited relatively lower light scattering compared to commercial scattering particles especially in the spectrum region larger than 700 nm where the absorption of common dyes is weak, due to the point attachment of spherical particles.24 Thus, much light within the red and infrared region is still lost. So far, the most widely utilized configuration is still the bilayer structure consisting of a nanocrystalline underlayer and a large-particle overlayer. The top performance of DSCs has been achieved by applying a TiO2 scattering layer on top of a nanocrystalline layer.25,26 Therefore, there is great need to develop TiO2 particles with excellent scattering/reflecting properties for practical photovoltaic application.
Recently, Shao et al. reported improved light harvesting of hierarchical TiO2 nanostructures with planar scattering effect.24 High scattering ability was also demonstrated by ZnO plate-like structures.27 Thus, TiO2 particles with large flat surface are expected to be good candidates for efficient light harvesting and thus high photovoltaic performance. In this paper, novel TiO2 single-crystalline microplates with well-defined hexagonal shape were prepared by a sol–gel-assisted hydrothermal process. The microplates exhibited excellent reflectance in the wavelength of 400–900 nm. Such TiO2 microplates were utilized as the scattering overlayer in DSCs, and effectively enhanced light harvesting and thus achieved a higher photovoltaic conversion efficiency compared to the commercial well-scattering layer. For comparison, TiO2 microrods with similar size were used for DSCs. The microrods showed lower reflectance and worse photovoltaic performance than TiO2 microplates. This evidence confirmed that the superior light scattering of TiO2 microplates should be attributed to the unique planar morphology.
Experimental
Synthesis of hexagonal TiO2 microplates
All chemical reagents were used as received without further purification. 3.5 g titanium tetraisopropoxide (TTIP) was completely hydrolyzed in deionized water for 1 h to obtain an amorphous precipitate. This precipitate was mixed with 5 g tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) in 1:1 water–ethanol solvent and became clear after heating to 80 °C. The resultant clear solution was then transferred to the autoclave and heated at 250 °C for 4 h.
Characterization
The crystal structure of the obtained product was investigated by an X-ray diffraction (XRD) diffractometer (JEOL, JDX-3500) with a Cu Kα radiation source. Morphologies and sizes were observed by a JSM-7001F field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) and a JEM-2100F field-emission transmission electron microscope (TEM). UV-vis optical spectra of the film samples were measured on a Shimatsu UV-vis 3600 spectrophotometer equipped with an integrating sphere.
Fabrication of DSCs
The paste of TiO2 hexagonal microplates was obtained by mixing the as-synthesized microplates with ethyl cellulose and α-terpineol. The screen-printable paste of TiO2 nanoparticles (∼20 nm) was also prepared by the same procedure. The nanocrystalline TiO2 paste was deposited on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass by a screen-printing method and then sintered at 500 °C for 1 h to form a transparent main layer (∼9.5 μm thick). The TiO2 microplate paste was then screen-printed on the annealed nanocrystalline film to construct the bilayer-structured photoanodes, followed by sintering at 500 °C. For comparison, the commercially available TiO2 scattering paste (200 nm, WER2-O, Dyesol) and the as-prepared TiO2 microrod28,29 paste were also coated on the nanocrystalline film to form the reference photoanodes. The thickness of the scattering layers is ∼4 μm. The resulting TiO2 electrodes were immersed in a mixed solvent of acetonitrile and tert-butanol (v/v = 1:1) containing 0.3 mM N719 dye for 1 day in the dark for efficient dye adsorption. The DSCs were fabricated by assembling the photoanode and the platinum counter electrode. The electrolyte was composed of 0.6 M methylpropyl-imidazolium iodide, 0.05 M I2, and 0.1 M LiI in acetonitrile with tert-butylpyridine and was injected into the cell through the hole on the back of the counter electrode.
Measurement
Photocurrent–voltage (J–V) curves of the DSCs were recorded by a digital source meter (2400, Keithley) under a standard air mass (AM 1.5) with simulated solar illumination at 100 mW cm−2 (WXS-90S-L2, Wacom).30 Monochromatic incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra were measured within the wavelength range from 300 to 900 nm with monochromatic incident light of 1 × 1016 photons cm−2 under 100 mW cm−2 white bias light in DC mode (CEP-2000BX, Bunkoh-Keiki). During both J–V and IPCE measurement, a black mask was applied with the active area of 0.25 cm2. The dye adsorption experiment was carried out by desorbing the dye-sensitized films in 0.1 M NaOH solution of water and ethanol (v/v = 1:1).
Results and discussion
TiO2 microplates were synthesized by hydrothermal treatment of titanium precursor in a water–ethanol solvent. Fig. 1 shows the powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the as-prepared product. All the peaks match the diffraction pattern of anatase TiO2 (tetragonal, JCPDS no. 21-1272) and no trace of any other impurity phase can be detected. The intensive and sharp diffraction peaks also indicate that the obtained TiO2 microplates are highly crystalline.

The unique morphology of the TiO2 microplate film is revealed by FE-SEM images. As shown in Fig. 2a, the TiO2 crystals have a two-dimensional hexagonal shape with the diameter of about 1.5–2 μm, most of which are parallel to or have small angles relative to the substrate surface. The more highly magnified FE-SEM in Fig. 2b show that such hexagonal-shaped TiO2 are composed of oriented layered petals, leading to the perfect six-fold symmetry of the microplates. The thickness of each layer is estimated to be 10–30 nm and the gap between layers may help to electrolyte diffusion. The microstructures of the microplates were further examined by TEM and high resolution TEM (HRTEM). Fig. 3a presents the TEM image of an individual microplate. The clear diffraction spots in the selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern confirm the single-crystalline nature of the microplates (inset of Fig. 3a). The HRTEM image in Fig. 3b demonstrates clear lattice fringes with the spacing of ∼0.35 nm, corresponding to the (101) lattice plane of the TiO2 anatase phase.

The utilization of the light-scattering effect is a simple and effective way to improve light harvesting. To estimate the scattering properties, the UV/Vis reflectance spectra of the TiO2 microplate film was measured. Here, well-scattering commercial TiO2 particles (WER2-O, Dyesol) were used as a reference scattering layer. As shown in Fig. 4, both of the films exhibit strong reflectance. Compared to the commercial TiO2, the TiO2 microplates possess higher reflectivity in the visible range, which means that TiO2 microplates have a better light-scattering capability for DSC application. The enhanced light reflectance can be attributed to the unique planar structure of the microplates. As shown in Fig. 5a, diffusive particles randomly scatter in all directions. Thus still much of the incident light is lost after the scattering layer. However, TiO2 microplates with the planar structure can directly reflect a large fraction of light back into the nanocrystalline underlayer and effectively confine the incident light within the photoanode, as shown in Fig. 5b. Thus, it is expected such a planar structure can significantly enhance light harvesting and improve the overall conversion efficiency.

To fabricate the DSCs, a 20 nm TiO2 transparent layer (∼9.5 μm thick) was coated on the FTO substrate. The bilayered photoanodes were constructed by depositing TiO2 microplates on top of the nanocrystalline TiO2 layer. Fig. 6 displays the cross-sectional SEM image of the bilayered structure. The thickness of the scattering layer is ∼4 μm. Due to the planar attachment, the TiO2 microplates are bound together to form a dense and crack-free film. The TiO2 microplate overlayer exhibits good adhesion to the nanocrystalline underlayer and no peeling was observed after annealing. For comparison, the TiO2 scattering layer (∼4 μm) composed of commercial large particles was also employed to form another bilayered electrode. Fig. 7 shows the current density–voltage (J–V) curves for the fabricated DSCs with only the nanocrystalline layer (DSC-N), with the commercial TiO2 particles as the scattering overlayer (DSC-NC), and with the TiO2 microplates as the scattering overlayer (DSC-NP). The corresponding photovoltaic parameters of the DSCs are summarized in Table 1. The photoanode made from a single-layer of nanocrystalline TiO2 possesses a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 12.4 mA cm−2 and an overall power-conversion efficiency (η) of 6.80%. After introducing a commercial TiO2 scattering layer, the conversion efficiency of DSC-NC is increased to 7.45%. Favorably, DSC-NP with the microplates as the scattering layer exhibits even superior photovoltaic performance to DSC-NC. It gives obviously higher JSC of 14.2 mA cm−2 and enhanced η of 7.91%. As shown in Table 1, the improved conversion efficiency of DSC-NP compared to DSC-N and DSC-NC is mainly attributed to the enhancement of the photocurrent density. Both dye loading and light scattering are major limiting factors in DSC performance. Dye adsorption experiments show that the TiO2 microplates have a low dye loading (0.806 × 10−8 mol cm−2), similar to that (0.837 × 10−8 mol cm−2) of the commercial scattering particles. Therefore, the improved JSC and conversion efficiency of DSC-NP compared to DSC-NC is the consequence of superior light-scattering effect from the microplate scattering layer.

The variation in JSC can be confirmed by incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurement.31Fig. 8 shows the monochromatic IPCE spectra of all the three cells. Compared to the single-layer photoanode, the double-layer structured photoanodes exhibit significantly increased IPCE over the entire wavelength region due to the introduction of the scattering layers. Moreover, the microplate photoanode has the highest IPCE values, following the trend observed in the J–V curves (Fig. 7). The IPCE spectra were normalized by the value at each 540 nm peak, which corresponds to the characteristic absorption of N719 dye. As shown in Fig. 8b, in the long-wavelength region (600–800 nm), DSC-NP achieves the higher normalized IPCE than DSC-NC, indicating the red light is more efficiently utilized through light scattering of the microplates. Hence, the normalized IPCE spectra provide a direct evidence for the superior light-scattering efficiency of the microplates.

In DSCs, large-size particles have been utilized to enhance light harvesting by the light-scattering effect, thus improving the conversion efficiency. However, such unique microplates as scatterers have not been documented for photovoltaic applications. In order to further confirm the morphology effect of TiO2 microplates on light scattering, anatase TiO2 microrods with similar diameter were synthesized (SEM image and XRD pattern in Fig. S1 in ESI†)) and compared with TiO2 microplates. Fig. 4 shows that TiO2 microrods have lower reflectance than TiO2 microplates in the whole spectrum, especially within the wavelength range from 400 to 800 nm. As such, the bilayered DSC with TiO2 microrods as the scattering layer (DSC-NR) exhibits worse device performance with η of 7.32%, compared to the microplate-based DSC. From the above results, the superior light scattering of TiO2 microplates can be attributed to their unique planar structure as illustrated in Fig. 5, considering the similar large size of TiO2 microplates and microrods and the same photoanode bilayered structure.
Conclusions
In summary, we have synthesized TiO2 microplates with uniform hexagonal shape by a hydrothermal method in a water–ethanol solvent. The highly crystallized microplates exhibited superior light-scattering due to the unique planar structures, which can reflect more light back into the photoanode. Thus, the DSC made with the TiO2 microplates as the scattering layer demonstrated enhanced light harvesting and conversion efficiency compared to the commercial scattering TiO2. The higher reflectance and photovoltaic performance of the microplates than the microrods of similar size further confirmed the positive effect of the planar morphology on light scattering.
