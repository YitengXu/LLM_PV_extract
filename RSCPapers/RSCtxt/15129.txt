    , Accepted 20th March 2018First published on 26th March 2018AbstractDeveloping green and efficient techniques for water sterilization is of great importance to public health. In this work, highly efficient photothermal water sterilization mediated by Prussian blue nanocages (PBNs) has been realized. The PBNs are synthesized via a facile hydrothermal method, which can act as high-performance photothermal agents owing to their strong and broad optical absorption covering the entire ultraviolet, visible and near-infrared (NIR) regions as well as their competent photothermal conversion capability. Using Escherichia coli as the bacterial model, a high photothermal antibacterial efficacy (∼100%) is achieved upon NIR irradiation as short as 5 min even at a low dosage (100 μg mL−1). Moreover, the results of the sterilization of polluted drinking water with all kinds of mixed bacteria show that the PBNs can eliminate almost all bacteria upon 10 min of NIR irradiation. Importantly, the photothermal sterilization effect of the PBNs upon mild solar irradiation (0.1 W cm−2) is also demonstrated, showing a killing rate of ∼99% upon 10 min of irradiation. Our work has highlighted the great potential of photothermal sterilization employing solar light for practical water treatments.

Environmental significance
Microbiological contamination in drinking water has been recognized as one of the grand environmental challenges. Although many sterilization techniques have been developed, their toxicity, by-products and remaining “dead zones” have raised serious concerns. Here, biocompatible and low-cost Prussian blue nanocages (PBNs) have been synthesized and used as photothermal agents. Owing to their strong broadband optical absorption and excellent photothermal conversion capability, a significant photothermal effect has been demonstrated not only upon near-infrared irradiation but also most importantly under simulated solar light, resulting in rapid and effective elimination of bacteria in drinking water.

Introduction
Microbiological contamination in drinking water has been recognized as one of the current global challenges. According to the report of the World Health Organization (WHO) released in 2012, there were still around 748 million people in the world without access to safe drinking water.1–5 To solve drinking water contamination, effective disinfection is of paramount importance.6 Conventional methods to remove microbes from drinking water are normally based on mass addition of disinfectants, such as chlorine, chlorine dioxide, or ozone,7,8 which have raised serious concerns about their by-products.9–11 Instead, novel antibacterial agents such as silver particles, antibiotics, antimicrobial peptides, etc. have been successfully developed and applied.12–15 However, besides being relatively expensive, the toxicity and biocompatibility of most of these agents still remain as major issues.16–18 Therefore, there is an urgent demand for developing green and reliable approaches to kill bacteria in drinking water.
Compared with other sterilization techniques, irradiation disinfection (e.g. by ultraviolet (UV)) produces nearly no by-products and has been widely applied for water purification. However, the penetration depth of UV is rather limited. Meanwhile, the turbidity, thickness and composition of water can all compromise the sterilization efficacy of UV irradiation, leaving “dead zones” of disinfection in water.5,19
An intriguing alternative also employing photo energy is to achieve the sterilization based on the photothermal effects mediated by photothermal agents (PTAs). In fact, the great potential of PTAs for antitumor photothermal therapy has been well demonstrated and has attracted enormous attention in recent years, in which the PTAs convert the adsorbed NIR energy into heat to generate local hyperthermia and hence ablate cancer cells.20–23 A wide variety of PTAs, such as metallic nanoparticles (NPs),24–26 metal sulfides/oxides,27–30 conjugated polymers,31,32 and so on, have been successfully developed.33,34 Amongst these, Prussian blue nanoparticles (PB NPs) are of particular interest due to their well-proved biosafety, high biocompatibility, low cost, simple synthesis, high stability, tunable morphology, and especially their excellent photothermal properties.35–38 Hitherto, applications of PB NPs to photothermal water sterilization have still been lacking. In particular, most results reported previously were based on the conversion of light in the near-infrared range into heat, which apparently confines the application perspectives considering a large portion of solar energy was unused, whilst photothermal sterilization by solar light irradiation remains unexplored.
In this work, we report the high performance of Prussian blue nanocages (PBNs) in the photothermal sterilization of water. The PBNs are synthesized by a facile hydrothermal method. The resultant products exhibit a distinct morphology as hollow cages, showing strong and broad optical absorbance covering the entire UV, visible and near-infrared (NIR) regions as well as significant photothermal conversion capability, which are both evidently superior to those of the solid PB (SPB) NPs without a hollow core. A high killing efficacy is achieved by the PBNs upon NIR irradiation. Nearly 100% of Escherichia coli (E. coli, 107 colony forming units per mL, CFU mL−1) are killed upon irradiation as short as 5 min even at a rather low dosage (100 μg mL−1). For the mixed bacteria in drinking water, all of them can be inactivated upon 10 min of irradiation. To further prove the practical application potential of the PBNs, the photothermal sterilization effect under mild solar light (0.1 W cm−2) is demonstrated, showing that nearly 99% of the bacteria can be killed after 10 min of irradiation. This work may stimulate the future development of photothermal disinfection technology based on high-performance PTAs for water treatment.
Experimental
Materials
Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP, K30), potassium ferricyanide (K3[Fe(CN)6]) and hydrochloric acid (HCl) (36.0–38.0%) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. Unless otherwise stated, all the chemicals and reagents were of analytical grade and used as received. De-ionized (DI) water (18.2 MΩ cm) from a Milli-Q water purification system was used in all the experiments.
Preparation of PBNs
The PBNs were prepared using a method reported previously.39 In brief, PVP (3.0 g) and K3[Fe(CN)6] (131.7 mg) were dissolved in a HCl solution (0.01 mol L−1, 40 mL) under magnetic stirring and ultrasonic oscillations until the solution became clear. Then the solution was heated to 80 °C and maintained at this temperature for 24 h. The resultant mesoporous SPB NPs were collected by centrifugation and washed with DI water before being dried in a vacuum at 50 °C overnight. PVP (100 mg) and SPB (20 mg) were dissolved in a HCl solution (1.0 mol L−1, 20 mL) in a Teflon vessel under magnetic stirring. After magnetic stirring for 2 h, the vessel was transferred into a stainless steel autoclave in an electric oven and kept at 140 °C for 4 h. The NPs were collected by centrifugation and washed with DI water. After freeze drying, the PBNs were obtained.
Characterization
The morphology and particle size of the PBNs were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi Limited, Japan) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Tecnai G20, FEI Co., USA), respectively. Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) was used to analyze the elements in the sample. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) was performed with a Malvern Zetasizer (Nano ZSP, Malvern, UK). Infrared (IR) spectra were collected using an IR spectrometer (Nicolet 6700, Thermo Scientific, USA). Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected using a Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer (Cu-Kα radiation, 1.54056 Å). NIR irradiation was performed with a continuous-wave diode laser with a center wavelength of 808 ± 10 nm (Beijing Kaipulin Optoelectronic Technology Co., China). The solar light was produced by a solar simulator covering the full spectrum (0.1 W cm−2). The temperature of the solutions was measured using a thermocouple microprobe (STPC-510P, Xiamen Baidewo Technology Co., China).
Photothermal effect experiments under solar simulator irradiation
3.0 mL of the PBN dispersion at gradient concentrations (0, 50, 100, 300, 500, 800 and 1000 μg mL−1) was added into a quartz cuvette and irradiated by the solar simulator (0.1 W cm−2) for 10 min. During the irradiation, the temperature of the dispersion was measured every 1 s using the thermocouple microprobe submerged in the dispersion.
Photothermal effect experiments under NIR irradiation
The procedures were similar to those for solar light irradiation, just replacing the solar simulator by NIR irradiation. In order to measure the photothermal conversion efficiency (η), the PBN dispersion (100 μg mL−1, 3.0 mL) and DI water were irradiated with NIR light until the temperature of the dispersions were steady. The temperature of the dispersion was recorded at an interval of 20 s. After the NIR light was turned off, the solution was naturally cooled to ambient temperature. In order to further investigate the photothermal stability, the PBN dispersion in water (100 μg mL−1, 3.0 mL) was repeatedly irradiated for 6 cycles. In each cycle, the sample was irradiated for 3 min and then cooled down for another 3 min.
Photothermal inactivation of E. coli upon NIR irradiation
All irradiation experiments were operated in standard 12-well plates. E. coli was chosen as the target microbe and cultivated at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium overnight. Until the colony grew beyond 107 CFU mL−1, the suspension was centrifuged (3000 rpm) for 5 min and washed with physiological saline (0.9 wt% NaCl in water) to remove the nutrients from the LB medium. Then the E. coli cells were diluted to the previous concentration with phosphate buffered solution (PBS).
To investigate the antibacterial effect of the PBNs on E. coli upon NIR irradiation, 3.0 mL of bacterial suspensions containing the PBN dispersion at different concentrations (0, 10, 30, 50, 80, 100 μg mL−1) were added in standard 12-well plates, exposed to the NIR light for 5 min (2 W cm−2), then spread on the agar (LB) plates and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. The E. coli suspension without irradiation served as the control group. To investigate the photothermal sterilization effect, six groups of bacterial suspensions (3.0 mL) containing the PBNs (100 μg mL−1) were exposed to NIR irradiation (2 W cm−2) for different durations (0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 min). The E. coli suspension without irradiation was used as the control group. After the irradiation, each sample was diluted 1 × 105-fold with sterilized PBS. A portion (20 μL) of the diluted bacteria suspensions was spread on the solid LB agar plate and incubated at 37 °C for 24 hours. Afterwards, the colony forming units (CFUs) were counted. All the PBS used in the above microorganism experiments was pre-sterilized by autoclaving at 121 °C for 30 min.
Photothermal inactivation of total bacteria in drinking water upon NIR irradiation
In order to investigate the photothermal inactivation effect on mixed bacteria (total bacteria), the water sample was first contaminated by mixing it with river water (Songhua River, China). Nutritive Songhua River water (10.0 mL) was mixed with clean tap water (50.0 mL) in a beaker and maintained at 37 °C on a shaker (150 rpm) for 1 day. Five groups of this contaminated water (3.0 mL) containing the PBNs (100 μg mL−1) were exposed to NIR irradiation (2 W cm−2) for different durations (0, 3, 5, 7 and 10 min, respectively).
Photothermal inactivation of total bacteria in drinking water using a solar simulator
The experiment on antibacterial effects in drinking water upon solar light irradiation (0.1 W cm−2) was conducted similarly to the NIR irradiation process. Three groups (3.0 mL) of contaminated drinking water containing 1 mg mL−1 PBNs were exposed to solar light irradiation for different durations (5, 7 and 10 min, respectively). Contaminated drinking water in the absence of PBNs was used as the control group. After irradiation, the samples were diluted respectively and their surviving bacterial concentrations were measured using the plate count method following the same procedures described above.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
The PBNs were produced by two-step synthesis using a slightly modified method reported previously.39 As shown in the SEM image (Fig. 1a), the PBNs adopted a typical cubic morphology, with an average size of ∼150 nm. The TEM image (Fig. 1b) further revealed the hollow structures as cages. To examine the dispersity, the hydrated ionic radius of PBNs was analyzed by DLS (Fig. 1c), showing a low polydispersity index (PDI) of ∼0.12 together with a slightly larger size than the results obtained from the TEM and SEM images. Elemental analysis was performed by EDX (Fig. 1d), where only Fe, C and N elements were present, implying no impurities in the product. The XRD pattern (Fig. 2a) is composed of a series of sharp peaks, corresponding to (200), (220), (400), (420), (422), (440), (600) and (620) crystal planes, which are all well-indexed to the face-centered cubic phase of PB (JCPDS. 52-1907), further confirming the high purity of the PBNs.

FT-IR spectroscopy (Fig. 2b) was used to characterize the chemical composition of the PBNs, showing the characteristic absorption bands of PB at 2086 cm−1 (attributed to the CN stretching in Fe2+–CN–Fe3+) and 1656 cm−1 along with a shoulder peak at around 1600 cm−1 (attributed to the CO stretching vibration of the PVP amide unit), consistent with the results in the literature.40 Importantly, as shown in the UV–vis–NIR spectra (Fig. 2c), the PBNs exhibited broad and strong optical absorption in the entire test range (300–1100 nm), which makes the PBNs a potential candidate not only for NIR-driven applications but also for the full-spectrum ones. Additionally, the specific surface area (SSA) was then analyzed via BET analysis of nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms. As shown in Fig. S1,† the as-prepared PBNs exhibit a SSA of 574.12 m2 g−1, which is much higher than that of the SPB NPs (160.55 m2 g−1). Furthermore, the PBNs show a narrow pore size distribution centered at 3.79 nm, confirming the mesoporous structure of the PBNs.
Measurement of photothermal properties upon NIR irradiation
The photothermal performance of the PBN dispersion at various concentrations (3.0 mL, 0, 10, 30, 50 and 100 μg mL−1) was investigated upon NIR irradiation (808 nm, 2 W cm−2) (Fig. 3a and b). A pronounced temperature rise was observed in the PBN dispersions while the temperature of DI water under the same irradiation barely changed at all. At 100 μg mL−1, the temperature was increased from 29 to 52.9 °C. The temperature elevation followed a dose- and irradiation duration-dependent manner. The significant photothermal effect of the PBNs laid the foundation for photothermal elimination of bacteria.

(c) Heating and cooling curves of a PBN suspension (100 μg mL−1, 3 mL). (d) Plot of cooling time versus the negative natural logarithm of the temperature driving force, which is obtained from the results in panel c. 
The photothermal conversion efficiency (η) of the PBNs was determined according to a method reported in the literature.41η can be calculated using the following equation:  where h and S are the heat transfer coefficient and the surface area of the container, respectively; Tmax and Tsurr are the maximum steady-state temperature and the ambient temperature of the surroundings; Qs is the baseline energy input by the solvent and the sample container without the PBNs; I is the NIR power; Aλ is the absorbance of the sample (PBNs, 100 μg mL−1) at 808 nm. Based on the results in Fig. 3c and d, η was calculated to be 44.0%.
For comparison, the optical absorption and photothermal properties of the SPB NPs were also investigated. As seen in Fig. S2,† at the same concentration, the optical absorption of the PBNs is slightly higher than that of the SPB NPs. Meanwhile, the η value of the SPB NPs was measured, showing an efficiency of ∼26% (Fig. S3a and b†), which was apparently much lower than that of the PBNs. Consistently, while the temperature rise of ∼32.9 °C was achieved from the PBNs (100 μg mL−1) upon 20 min of irradiation, the temperature of the SPB NP sample was only increased to ∼23.9 °C under the same irradiation (Fig. S3a†). All the results indicate that the distinctive nanocage morphology of the PBNs has further improved their photothermal performance relative to the normal solid PB NPs.
Additionally, reliable photothermal conversion stability is also crucial for PTAs for practical photothermal applications. As shown in Fig. 4a, the temperature rise remained steady upon repeated heating–cooling cycles. There was no variation observed in the optical absorbance after six photothermal cycles (Fig. 4b). All the results support that the PBNs exhibit excellent photothermal conversion capability and conversion stability, holding great promise for photothermal sterilization of water.

Photothermal sterilization of water upon NIR irradiation
First of all, the killing effect of the PBNs dispersion at various concentrations was explored by using E. coli cells as the typical bacteria model upon a short NIR (808 nm, 2.0 W cm−2) irradiation for 5 min. Effective inactivation of E. coli was observed, which is strongly dependent on the PBN concentration applied (Fig. 5a and b). The sterilization rate dramatically increased with the concentration, e.g. reaching 75.4% at 50 μg mL−1 and nearly 100% at 100 μg mL−1. In sharp contrast, for the E. coli cells treated with the NIR alone (without the PBNs) or PBNs alone (without irradiation), the survival rate of the cells remained the same.

In order to determine how quick the bacteria can be inactivated by the PBNs effectively, E. coli cells treated by NIR irradiation for various durations from 1 to 5 min were performed, keeping the concentration of the PBNs the same (100 μg mL−1). As shown in the optical images in Fig. 6a, the sterilization efficacy was not significant upon irradiation for 3 min or shorter. When the irradiation duration was extended, the killing effect was more and more pronounced. Upon 5 min of irradiation, all the bacteria were eliminated. Colony counting (Fig. 6b) further confirmed that the PBNs were able to reduce the bacteria population (∼55%) after 3 min of NIR irradiation, and the bacterial inactivation percentage was 100% upon 5 min of irradiation.

Results are presented with SD (n = 3). (c) Infrared thermal images of the PBN dispersion (100 μg mL−1) irradiated using NIR light for various durations. 
As shown in Fig. 6c, the real-time temperature elevation of. E. coli cells incubated with the PBNs (100 μg mL−1) can be directly visualized upon NIR irradiation (2 W cm−2) by infrared thermal imaging. Consistently, the brightness of the images can indicate the temperature, which increased with irradiation time. It was shown that the temperature of the dispersion reached 68.6 °C from 24.0 °C within 5 min.
To examine their practical potential for the sterilization of drinking water, the photothermal performance of the PBNs was examined for mixed bacteria (total bacteria) (Fig. 7). The viability of all kinds of bacteria in polluted drinking water was measured after being treated with the PBNs (100 μg mL−1) and irradiated using NIR light for various durations (0, 3, 5, 7 and 10 min, respectively) (Fig. 7a). The viability was measured by counting the number of live bacterial colonies. It is found that the inhibition rate was strongly dependent on the irradiation duration. For instance, the viability of total bacteria decreased to 30% after 5 min of irradiation (Fig. 7b), and the killing rate reached up to nearly 100% upon 10 min of NIR irradiation. These results indicate that the PBN-mediated photothermal sterilization was effective not only on E. coli but also on total bacteria in contaminated drinking water. Moreover, the optical absorption of the PBNs after 10 min of NIR irradiation in drinking water was measured, showing no noticeable variation (Fig. 7c), further indicating the excellent photothermal stability, hence the reliable application potential of the PBNs.

Results are presented with SD (n = 3). (c) UV-vis-NIR absorption spectra of the PBNs before/after the irradiation. 
Measurement of photothermal properties using a solar simulator
Solar light is the most abundant and sustainable green energy with a wide spectrum from UV to infrared; sterilization driven by solar light irradiation would be rather preferred and is interesting for safe and environmentally friendly bacteria elimination. The strong and broad optical absorbance of PBNs in the UV, visible and NIR regions has enabled this possibility. To simulate the conditions in practical applications, the photothermal effect of the PBNs was investigated upon mild irradiation (0.1 W cm−2) by a solar simulator.
The photothermal effect was investigated by monitoring the temperature of the PBN aqueous dispersion (3.0 mL) at various concentrations (0, 50, 100, 300, 500, 800 and 1000 μg mL−1) upon solar light irradiation. An obvious concentration-dependent temperature elevation was observed (Fig. 8a and b). The temperature was increased from 26.0 °C to 41.0 °C and 56.0 °C, respectively, for the PBN dispersions at 100 and 1000 μg mL−1, indicating that PBNs can act as an efficient PTA even upon solar light irradiation.

Photothermal sterilization using the PBNs upon mild solar light irradiation was finally investigated in polluted drinking water (Fig. 9). The sterilization rate also followed a dose- and irradiation duration-dependent manner. At 1 mg mL−1, nearly 99% of bacteria in the contaminated drinking water were eliminated upon 10 min of solar light irradiation.

The key factor for effective disinfection is based on the fact that PBNs are capable of absorbing irradiated light and subsequently converting the energy into local hyperthermia. It has been revealed that at a temperature higher than 50 °C, the enzymes in bacteria could be denatured so the key intracellular reactions of bacteria would be inhibited.42 In our case, the heat produced by PBNs upon solar light or NIR irradiation could efficiently raise the solution temperature to greater than 50 °C. As a result, the bacteria could be eliminated effectively. To directly visualize the effect, morphology characterization of E. coli incubated with PBNs (100 μg mL−1) was performed using SEM. It is found that, at variance with the intact and smooth morphology of E. coli without irradiation (Fig. 10a), the cells were severely shriveled and cracked after irradiation (Fig. 10b).
 Fig. 10  SEM images of E. coli cells incubated with PBNs (a) before and (b) after 808 nm NIR irradiation for 5 min. 
Our results indicate that the use of PBNs for direct photothermal inactivation can effectively annihilate bacteria in water. The superior performance of PBNs with low cost, simple synthesis and high stability supports their practical application potential. In particular, the well-demonstrated biocompatibility and biosafety of PB materials further emphasize their promise. Still, proper removal of PBNs after disinfection treatment would be preferred to lower the risk of toxicity and the cost. Encouragingly, this issue can be nicely solved. Firstly, the PBNs could be efficiently collected by centrifugation (Fig. S4a and b†). Secondly, water containing PBNs can be easily filtered to separate PBNs (Fig. S4c and d†). Moreover, incorporating PBNs with magnetic components may also fulfill the task.
Conclusions
In summary, we have realized the highly effective sterilization of water based on the photothermal effect of PBNs. The PBNs exhibit strong absorption from the UV region to the NIR region, high photothermal conversion efficiency and photothermal conversion stability, resulting in their high antibacterial capability not only on E. coli cells but also on the total bacteria in polluted drinking water. Importantly, besides the high killing efficacy upon NIR irradiation, a high inactivation rate (∼99%) was also achieved using mild solar light irradiation with a power density as low as 0.1 W cm−2. This work demonstrates the potential of applying high-performance PTAs with wide optical absorption for practical photothermal sterilization of water utilizing solar light.

Environmental significance
Microbiological contamination in drinking water has been recognized as one of the grand environmental challenges. Although many sterilization techniques have been developed, their toxicity, by-products and remaining “dead zones” have raised serious concerns. Here, biocompatible and low-cost Prussian blue nanocages (PBNs) have been synthesized and used as photothermal agents. Owing to their strong broadband optical absorption and excellent photothermal conversion capability, a significant photothermal effect has been demonstrated not only upon near-infrared irradiation but also most importantly under simulated solar light, resulting in rapid and effective elimination of bacteria in drinking water.


 	Fig. 1  (a) SEM image, (b) TEM image, (c) the hydrodynamic diameter and (d) EDX analysis of the PBNs.	 

 	Fig. 2  (a) XRD patterns and (b) FT-IR spectra of the PBNs. (c) UV-vis-NIR absorption spectra of the PBN dispersion (100 μg mL−1).	 

 	Fig. 3  (a) Temperature variation of the PBN suspensions at various concentrations upon NIR irradiation. DI water is used as the control. (b) Plot of the temperature rise attained upon 10 min of irradiation for the PBN suspensions at the indicated concentrations. Results are presented with the standard deviation (SD, n = 3). (c) Heating and cooling curves of a PBN suspension (100 μg mL−1, 3 mL). (d) Plot of cooling time versus the negative natural logarithm of the temperature driving force, which is obtained from the results in panel c.
