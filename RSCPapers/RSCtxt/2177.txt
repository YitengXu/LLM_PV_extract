    , Accepted 20th September 2022First published on 21st September 2022AbstractThe enticing features of metal molybdates make them an attractive candidate for energy storage systems. This report describes the synthesis of three distinct single-phase bismuth molybdates (Bi2MoxOy; α-Bi2Mo3O12, β-Bi2Mo2O9, and γ-Bi2MoO6) using the gel matrix particle growth method and their application in high-performance asymmetric supercapacitors. The single phase and purity of the synthesized Bi2MoxOy particles were confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and further verified by Raman analysis. The UV–visible spectra show the electronic and optical behaviours of the as-synthesized α, β, and γ Bi2MoxOy. The morphologies of the as-synthesized three different Bi2MoxOy phases were analysed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The particle formation was further investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and the interplanar spacings of the Bi2MoxOy phases were in accordance with the planes. The surface area and pore volume of the prepared samples were analysed using Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) analysis. The electrochemical properties of the products were confirmed by various tests, including cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge discharge (GCD), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in 3 M KOH. Among the three phases, α-Bi2Mo3O12 exhibits a huge specific capacitance (Cs) of 714 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1. Furthermore, it displays an admirable cycling stability of 86.55% after 5000 cycles. The chosen α-Bi2Mo3O12 electrode possesses an increased energy density of 47.5 W h kg−1 at 1 A g−1 with a capacitive retention rate of 71.90% at 5 A g−1 after 10000 cycles. A remarkable electrochemical performance of Bi2Mo3O12 with an exceptional power density of 750 W kg−1 was observed for the prepared asymmetric device. Bismuth molybdate's notable performance indicates that it can be an active material for energy storage applications.
1. Introduction
The expanding need for electric power and the constrained availability of fossil fuels with increased population necessitate sustainable energy conversion and storage solutions. In this sense, a suitable device that stores energy with a high capacity and large power density with prolonged activity is required, which is capable of serving future generation energy storage applications such as hybrid and electric vehicles.1–3 Due to the short cycle life, restricted power performance, and overheating difficulties with well-known storage devices such as batteries, we require an alternative technology to address these challenges.4 Electrochemical capacitors, known as supercapacitors, are rapidly emerging devices that store energy as they bridge the gap between electrolytic capacitors and batteries. Compared with lithium-ion batteries and capacitors, supercapacitors have a tremendous power density, prolonged life cycle, high self-discharge, and the ability to retain an enormous amount of electrical energy, which is attracting the attention of worldwide researchers.5–7
Depending on charge storage methodologies, ultracapacitors (supercapacitors) are grouped into pseudocapacitors and electric double-layer capacitors (EDLCs), relying on faradaic and non-faradaic interactions at the terminals of electrodes and electrolytes.8–10 The major limitation of supercapacitors is that they have a lower energy density (i.e., the total energy stored per volume), lower specific capacitance, and lower operation voltage than lithium-ion batteries.11 The electron flow or the conductivity of the active material that relies on the surface area significantly influences the efficiency of these devices.12,13 To overcome this barrier, researchers are developing efficient electrode materials that should possess rapid kinetics of electrons and ions.14 Nanomaterials with high capacitive behavior are being employed as common electrode materials in supercapacitors as nanomaterials may promote charge growth and ion conveyance.15
Various transition metal oxides (including NiO,16 Fe2O3,17 MnO2,18 RuO2,19 and Co3O420), conducting polymers (polypyrrole, polyaniline, and poly(3,4-ethylene dioxy thiophene)), carbon-derived materials, metal sulfides, and transition metal dichalcogenides are the commonly used electrode materials.21,22 While metal sulfides exhibit low power density, durability, and cycle efficiency, the conducting polymers and metal chalcogenides have stability concerns and lower specific capacitance (Cs).23 Metal molybdates, in particular, exert a synergistic action of a combination of metals and molybdates, resulting in improved conductivity and stability, which is required for effective energy storage.24
Bismuth molybdates, members of the Aurivillius-related oxide family, one of the important semiconducting materials having the general formula Bi2O3·nMoO3, where n = 1 to 3, comprise perovskite-like (MoO4)2− and fluorite-like (Bi2O2)2+ slabs arranged alternately. The three different phases of bismuth molybdates, α-Bi2Mo3O12, β-Bi2Mo2O9, and γ-Bi2MoO6, differ in their crystal structures and elemental compositions.25,26 This layered structure favors oxide ion movement and grants a limited band gap that can be extended.27 Bismuth vanadate (BiVo4),28 bismuth tungstate (Bi2Wo6),29 bismuth molybdate (Bi2MoO6), and bismuth dichalcogenides (Bi2A3; A = O, S, Se, and Te)30 have all received considerable attention in research and development among Bi NCs due to their effective photocatalytic performance, low toxicity, good stability, corrosion resistance, well-defined morphology and geometry, unique optical band gap and high dielectric strength.31,32 Bismuth molybdates, important components among transition metal oxides, have vast applications in gas sensing, solar cells, and photocatalytic water purification.33,34 Seevakan et al. investigated the magnetic, structural, and electrochemical behaviors of Bi2Mo2O9 using the microwave combustion technique. Bi2Mo2O9 NPs demonstrated outstanding electrochemical behavior with a high specific capacitance of 197 F g−1 at 0.4 A g−1 and excellent cyclic stability with a 94% retention rate.15 Kunda Samadani et al. created an array of self-assembling Bi2MoO6 nanopetals on carbon spheres for supercapacitor applications. The Bi2MoO6@carbon sphere is an excellent electrode material, exhibiting 521 F g−1 specific capacitance at 1 A g−1 and a cycling stability of 80% after 10000 cycles.35 To date, no such reports on Bi2Mo3O12 for supercapacitor applications and bismuth-based electrode materials have been explored in-depth. Among various synthesis techniques, the cost-effective gel matrix method is adopted for synthesising a single-phase self-assembly and forming highly uniform material particles at low temperatures.36,37
In this work, rarely discussed phases of bismuth molybdates (Bi2MoxOy), α-Bi2Mo3O12, β-Bi2Mo2O9, and γ-Bi2MoO6, were prepared by the gel processing method. The structural, surface morphologies and pore sizes of Bi2MoxOy particles were studied by XRD, SEM, TEM and BET analyses. RAMAN and UV spectroscopy were performed to investigate the optical properties of the as-synthesised particles. The electrochemical properties of the synthesized nanoparticles were analyzed using cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge–discharge analysis (GCD), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis. The phases of Bi2MoxOy and their efficiency in supercapacitor applications were thoroughly explored.
2. Materials and methods
2.1 Materials
Bismuth(III) nitrate pentahydrate (Bi(NO3)3·5H2O), ammonium heptamolybdate tetrahydrate ((NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O), and ethylene glycol (C2H6O2) were purchased from Merck Life Sciences. Citric acid monohydrate (C6H8O7·H2O) and acetic acid glacial (CH3COOH) were purchased from SISCO and Nice Chemicals. The chemicals utilized in this work were used without any purification.
2.2 Synthesis
The complex gel matrix method was used to synthesize distinct phases of bismuth molybdates, such as α-Bi2Mo3O12, β-Bi2Mo2O9, and γ-Bi2MoO6 particles, using bismuth(III) nitrate pentahydrate, ammonium heptamolybdate tetrahydrate, ethylene glycol, and citric acid as precursors. The solvents used for the preparation were deionized water and acetic acid. 1.75 mmol of Bi(NO3)3·5H2O was dissolved in 5 ml of CH3COOH. Similarly, 0.25 mmol of (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O was dissolved in 45 ml of deionized water (Bi:Mo, 1:1). The precursors were dissolved completely without precipitation left over. In the obtained clear solution, 2 mmol of C6H8O7·H2O was added and stirred for 20 min, being capable of complex formation with metal ions. As a result, bismuth citrate was formed. Four drops of C2H6O2, a linker, were added to the bismuth citrate solution to polymerize the complex. The glycol-added solution was kept in a magnetic stirrer and stirred for 7 h at 80 °C.38,39 The temperature was maintained throughout the process. A transparent gel was formed after the entire evaporation of the liquid species present in the solution.
The liquid gel suspension was then preheated at 250 °C for half an hour. The preheated sample was collected and annealed at 550 °C and maintained for an hour. Upon treating at 550 °C, the reactor was left to cool at ambient temperature. The obtained (Bi2Mo2O9) powder was yellow. Adopting the above procedure, the other two phases of bismuth molybdate [Bi2MoO6 and Bi2Mo3O12] were synthesized. The adopted metal stoichiometric ratios between Bi and Mo for Bi2MoO6, Bi2Mo2O9, and Bi2Mo3O12 were 1:0.5, 1:1, and 1:1.5, respectively.
2.3 Electrode preparation
The electrochemical analysis of the as-synthesized NPs was made both in three-electrode and two-electrode systems using cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). In a three-electrode configuration, bismuth molybdate NPs were used as the working electrode (WE), Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode (RE), and Pt wire as the counter electrode (CE) with 3 M KOH electrolyte. A homogeneous slurry was formed by combining the solvent methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (NMP) with the active material (85%), activated carbon (15%), and PVDF (5%) for the cathode. The collected slurry was uniformly coated on a 1 cm2 area of Ni-foam of 2 × 1 cm. The coated Ni-foam was then placed in a hot air oven at 70 °C for 12 hours. Activated carbon electrodes were made using the same approach, employing activated carbon as the active component. Bi2Mo3O12 NPs and AC were adopted as the positive and negative electrode, respectively, for creating an asymmetric supercapacitor (two-electrode configuration) in 3 M KOH electrolyte, with a piece of filter paper sandwiched between the electrodes.
2.4 Characterization
The purity of the phase and crystallinity of the synthesized Bi2MoxOy particles was investigated using a Rigaku Ultima III Max Powder X-ray diffractometer (Japan) with an angular range of 10–90° 2θ with CuKα radiation (λ = 1.54 Å) at a scan rate of 2° min−1. Using a Horiba Jobin Yuvon HR 800 Raman spectrometer, the Raman spectral analysis was performed under excitation at 532 nm. The optical properties of the chemical compounds were studied using diffuse reflectance with a Thermofisher UV–visible spectrophotometer. A ZEISS EVO 18 scanning electron microscope (SEM) was used to determine the surface morphology of pristine metal molybdates. The morphology of the synthesized bismuth molybdate particles was further confirmed using a JOEL JEM-2100 Plus TEM. A Quantachrome Nova Station A Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area analyzer was used to measure the surface area and pore volume of the synthesized samples. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis of all the distinct Bi2MoxOy phases was performed via Thermo Scientific K-Alpha Surface Analysis with an Al source. The electrochemical behavior of the as-obtained samples was investigated in an electrochemical workstation (Biologic SP-150) by employing different studies such as cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge–discharge, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Structural analysis
XRD was employed to ascertain the formation of phase and crystal structure of the as-synthesized Bi2MoO6, Bi2Mo2O9, and Bi2Mo3O12 samples. Fig. 1 shows the XRD pattern of the distinct phases of bismuth molybdates (Bi2MoO6, Bi2Mo2O9, and Bi2Mo3O12). The recorded XRD pattern confirms the high crystallinity of bismuth molybdates. The obtained peaks correlate with the standard data for all three phases. The α-Bi2Mo3O12 and β-Bi2Mo2O9 phases exhibit monoclinic structures with the corresponding space groups P21/n and P21/c. The α-Bi2Mo3O12 phase shows characteristic peaks at 27.2, 27.8, 29.1, and 30.9° at 2θ of planes (−123), (−221), (023), and (040), respectively. For β-Bi2Mo2O9, the monoclinic structure is identified, which has its intense characteristic peaks at 29, 31.6, and 46.5° 2θ that correspond to the (−132), (223), and (−343) planes, respectively. The orthorhombic structure of γ-Bi2MoO6 (space group – Pca21) manifests with planes (131) and (200) with peaks at 28.2 and 32.6°. The XRD results indicate that all three phases of the Bi2MoxOy samples are single in phase. The Bi2MoO6 and Bi2Mo2O9 samples contain trace amounts of Bi2Mo2O9 and Bi2MoO6, respectively.

3.2. Raman spectral analysis
Raman spectroscopy provides chemical and structural information that aids in the identification of materials. The Raman spectra of pristine Bi2MoO6, Bi2Mo2O9, and Bi2Mo3O12 are depicted in Fig. 2. The Bi2Mo2O9 and Bi2MoO6 spectra, ranging from 100 cm−1 to 1000 cm−1, show a comparable vibrational mode without any abrupt changes in Raman shift; however, there is a variance in Raman band intensity. The wagging, twisting, and bending states of Mo–O bonding are responsible for the peaks below 600 cm−1.40 α-Bi2Mo3O12 has intense predominant peaks at 812 and 898 cm−1. The intense prominent peaks are due to the unique bond architectures from the MoO5 moieties. In Bi2MoO6, the peak at 884 cm−1 was displaced to 898 cm−1 and grew more intense in Bi2Mo3O12. The Bi–O stretching vibrations and Mo2O2 dioxo vibrations cause a peak at 510 cm−1.41 In the case of Bi2MoO6, the Eg mode of bending vibrations produces a peak at 284 cm, while the peak at 350 cm originates from the Eu symmetric binding mode. Compared to Bi2MoO6, the intensity of the peaks at 446 and 490 cm−1 is reduced in Bi2Mo2O9. The spacing and respective intensity of the two peaks vary, indicating that the Mo–O bonds are involved in distinct stretching modes. The bending movement of MoO6 octahedra combines with the stretching and bending modes of bismuth oxygen polyhedra to produce bands in the range of 180–500 cm−1. The Mo–O stretching motion and the O–Mo–O bending mode are attributed to the Bi2Mo2O9 peaks at 885 and 446 cm−1, respectively. The intense peaks at 707, 885, 716, and 887 cm−1 are due to the Mo–O stretching vibrations of orthorhombic distorted MoO6 octahedra.42

3.3. UV–visible spectroscopy
Several features such as the morphology of the surface, the size of the particles, deficient oxygen sites, and band gap alter the optical response of the semiconductor materials. Fig. 3(a) depicts the reflectance curve of the three phases of bismuth molybdate. The optical spectra of bismuth molybdate show that the absorption edges of the three phases are positioned in a region of visible light due to the charge transfer from O2− to Mo6+.43 The steep form of the spectra of the three phases reveals that visible light absorption was prompted by the band gap transition rather than the transition from the impurity state. The number of oxygen ions coordinated to the molybdenum ion greatly influences the energy gap of bismuth molybdate, resulting in different band gap values of the three phases.44 Due to the electron transition from the HOMO to the LUMO, the cut-off edges occur at about 410–490 nm in the absorption spectra of Bi2Mo3O12. In addition, the oxygen vacancies in Bi2Mo3O12 greatly extend its visible light absorption region.31 Bi2MoO6 exhibits stronger absorption at higher wavelengths with a cut-off edge of 490–570 nm, while Bi2Mo2O9 has a cut-off wavelength of 450 nm.

Fig. 3(b) illustrates the Tauc plots of the three phases of bismuth molybdate. In addition, the values corresponding to the band gaps of the three phases Bi2Mo3O12, Bi2Mo2O9, and Bi2MoO6 were found to be 3.12, 3, and 2.8 eV, respectively.
3.4. Morphological analysis with SEM
The surface morphology of the synthesized bismuth molybdate samples is shown in Fig. 4. The images of Bi2MoO6 shown in Fig. 4(a–c) indicate that the ribbon tubular structures are interconnected and that vivid formation occurs with voids. Upon magnification, the arrangement of particles as spheres is visible and portrayed as petal-like structures. The spherical shape thus is a cluster of numerous uneven, non-specific particles that tend toward this formation. Fig. 4(d–f) for Bi2Mo2O9 shows the numerous embedded microporous structures that further result in an uneven honeycomb formation. These microporous structures enable an increased number of active sites for electrolytic ion adsorption and strengthen the material's supercapacitor performance. Fig. 4(g–i) for Bi2Mo3O12 represents the self-assembled particles. They appear together as clusters with distinct sizes and shapes. The images showcase the non-uniformity of the samples, such that some appear as tubes or spheres with indefinite shapes.

3.5. TEM analysis
The detailed growth formation of the distinct phases of bismuth molybdate was investigated using TEM analysis. Fig. 5(a–d) depicts the TEM images of the as-synthesized Bi2MoO6 confirming the self-assembled spherical structures of the particles. The HRTEM images show the lattice spacing of 3.12 Å, corresponding to the (131) plane of Bi2MoO6. Fig. 5(e–h) shows the TEM images of countless hexagonal patterns of Bi2Mo2O9 interlinked together. The interplanar spacing of about 3.17 Å correlates to the crystallographic plane (023) of Bi2Mo2O9. The TEM images of Bi2Mo3O12Fig. 5(i–l) affirm the self-assembly of irregularly shaped particles. Upon magnification, Bi2Mo3O12 exhibits elongated spherical structures with an interplanar distance of 6.89 Å respective to the (100) plane. From microscopy analysis, Bi2MoxOy particle formation by the gel matrix method leads to the self-assembly of the particles. This clearly shows the pore formation among the particles and was confirmed by TEM and SEM analyses. This self-assembly particle pore formation is advantageous to the electrochemical performance of the Bi2MoxOy materials. The growth behavior of Bi2MoxOy changes with increasing number of Mo ions in the structure, and the particle shape is also highly influenced by the stoichiometric ratio between Bi and Mo.

3.6. BET analysis
The surface area and pore size distribution of the prepared bismuth molybdate sample were analyzed using Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) analysis. The specific surface area and pore volume of Bi2MoO6, Bi2Mo2O9, and Bi2Mo3O12 are tabulated in Table 1; all the synthesized samples are mesoporous in nature. While the combustion reaction occurred in the metal citrate–ethylene glycol gel, organics were decomposed and the gas remains were released from the system. This is the reason for the pore formation in all the Bi2MoxOy samples. The grain growth of the Bi2MoxOy phase samples appeared different as the pore diameter increased with increasing molybdenum ratio. Fig. 6 illustrates the nitrogen adsorption and desorption measurements of the distinct phases of bismuth molybdate.

3.7. XPS analysis
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy was performed to investigate the surface chemical constituents and the valence level of the synthesized bismuth molybdates. The entire survey spectrum is depicted in Fig. 7(a), extending from 0 to 1200 eV, indicating even incorporation of the elements Bi, Mo, and O and confirming that the material was effectively synthesized. Fig. 7(b–d) displays the individual XPS spectra of Bi 4f, Mo 3d, and O 1s. The Bi4f high-resolution spectrum reveals the presence of two definite peaks at 59.6 and 164 eV shown in Fig. 7(b), which are attributed to Bi 4f7/2 and Bi 4f5/2, respectively.45,46 In agreement with the other two, the peaks for Bi2Mo3O12 are shifted to 165 eV, signifying the trivalent oxidation state for bismuth (Bi3+). The Mo 3d spectrum in Fig. 7(c) contains only two intense peaks, ascribed to Mo 3d5/2 and Mo 3d3/2 at 232.8 and 236 eV. These findings imply that Mo is in an oxidation state of Mo6+. The O 1s spectra of Bi2MoO6, Bi2Mo2O9, and Bi2Mo3O12 are shown in Fig. 7(d), with only one significant peak at 530.7 eV owing to Mo–O bonds. The O 1s peak of Bi2Mo3O12 has been considerably shifted to the higher end of 531.1 eV, which has been assigned to surface hydroxyl groups. In addition to the characteristic peak at 530 eV, Bi2Mo2O9 has an extra tiny hub at 532.3 eV.47,48

3.8. Electrochemical analysis
The electrochemical performance of the as-synthesized bismuth molybdates was investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and the galvanostatic charge discharge (GCD) technique. Fig. 8(a–c) displays the CV curves of Bi2MoO6, Bi2Mo2O9, and Bi2Mo3O12 over the potential window of 0.0–0.5 V. The charge accumulation is based on the pair of redox reactions49 as the CV graph shows the presence of oxidation (anodic) and reduction (cathodic) peaks. The three electrodes exhibit EDLC and pseudocapacitive characteristics as demonstrated by the voltammograms with a varying scan rate ranging from 5 to 100 m V s−1. The enhanced scan rate gives rise to an increase in current, and the CV curves reflect a linear behavior. A similar pattern with a varied scan rate attributes the oxidation and reduction reactions and the pseudocapacitive behaviour to the faradaic redox reactions. At higher scan rates, however, the anodic peaks are positively shifted, and the cathodic peaks are negatively shifted due to the polarization of the electrode, superior charge collection, and resistance of the interface of the electrode materials.50–52 Bismuth molybdates exhibit the same faradaic redox reactions as bismuth oxide in an alkaline electrolyte.53,54 The specific capacitance from the CV profile can be computed using the formula (1): (1)where v denotes the scan rate (V s−1), m denotes the mass of the active material (g), and (Vc − Va) represents the potential window (Volts).
 Fig. 8  Comparative CV curves of Bi2MoO6 (a), Bi2Mo2O9 (b) and Bi2Mo3O12 (c) and the GCD curves of Bi2MoO6 (d), Bi2Mo2O9 (e) and Bi2Mo3O12 (f). 
To determine the specific capacitance of the material, GCD was carried out at varying current densities ranging from 1 to 5 A g−1 with a potential range of 0.0–0.5 V, as shown in Fig. 8(d–f). The symmetric nature of the discharge curves of all three phases of bismuth molybdates shows the typical faradaic behavior of the charge storage mechanism. The specific capacitance can be calculated using the formula (2): (2)where m represents the mass of the active material (g) coated, ΔV denotes the applied potential window (Volts), the discharge time (s) is represented by Δt from the charge–discharge curve, and I denotes the current density (A).
The as-synthesized Bi2MoO6, Bi2Mo2O9, and Bi2Mo3O12 electrodes show specific capacitances of 584, 644, and 714 F g−1 at 1 A g−1. The discharge curves show a slight ohmic drop as the discharge starts, suggesting high oxidation and reduction reversibility. Bi2Mo3O12 exhibits a higher specific capacitance and longer discharge time than the other two. Specific capacitance diminishes with an increment in current density because electrolyte ion diffusion is difficult under high flux conditions.55,56
Cycling stability is an essential consideration when it comes to supercapacitor energy storage features. The cycling stability of the Bi2MoO6, Bi2Mo2O9, and Bi2Mo3O12 electrodes was analyzed using GCD at a fixed current density of 5 A g−1 for 5000 cycles, as shown in Fig. 9. Bi2Mo3O12 has a greater capacitive retention rate of 86.55% after 5000 cycles, representing strong cyclic stability with outstanding electrical conductivity compared to Bi2MoO6 and Bi2Mo2O9.

For a better insight into the charge transfer properties and capacitive behavior of electrodes, EIS analysis was performed at frequencies ranging from 100 kHz to 0.01 Hz in 3 M KOH electrolyte. The Nyquist plot and an equivalent circuit plot are displayed in Fig. 10 for fitting the EIS data, which depicts that the electrode/electrolyte of the system shows the frequency response by probing the imaginary component (−Z) of the impedance comparable with the real component (Z).57 The EIS spectrum comprises two sections: (i) the semi-circle segment in the high-frequency range attributed to charge diffusion in the electrode/electrolyte interface; and (ii) the sloped line part in the lower frequency region (Warburg impedance) depending on the transport/diffusion of ion from the electrolyte to electrode interface. The diameter of the semi-circle segment correlates to the electrode's charge transfer resistance (Rct). The intercept at the real part (the Z-axis) at a higher frequency region, relative to the equivalent series resistance (ESR), encompasses active material intrinsic resistance, electrolyte resistance, and contact resistance between the current collector and the electrode.58,59 From the fit equivalent circuit C1/(R1 + C2/R2 + M3), Bi2MoO6, Bi2Mo2O9 and Bi2Mo3O12 possess the Rct values of 0.1740, 0.1182 and 0.1858 Ω with the corresponding values of Rs being 0.5066, 0.3407 and 0.3315 Ω. The increased capacitance in accordance with the decrease in resistance value signifies the enhanced bias potential. Compared with other electrodes, Bi2Mo3O12 exhibits high charge transfer resistance with a low Rs value symbolizing fast charge transfer properties and good conductivity. Bi2Mo3O12 also has a higher slope of the diffusion line, indicating improved ion diffusion and capacitive behavior, which validates both the CV and the GCD results. The comparative electrochemical performance of the as-synthesised working electrode materials with previous reports is presented in Table 2.

3.9. Asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC)
To examine the practical applicability of as-synthesized Bi2Mo3O12, an asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) was prepared. In a two-electrode configuration, using Bi2Mo3O12 as the positive electrode and activated carbon (AC) as the negative electrode, the electrochemical behavior was analyzed in a 3 M KOH electrolyte. Initially, cyclic voltammetry was carried out to figure out the potential window of the device. The sum of the potential of both electrodes (Bi2Mo3O12 and AC) gives the potential of the ASC device. The maximum potential window for the ASC device is extended up to 1.5 V in the 3 M KOH electrolyte, above which there is a minimal deformation of CV curves as shown in Fig. 11(a). The charge stored on both electrodes should be balanced.60,61 The mass of the material coated on the electrodes is balanced by the mass balance formula (3): (3)where m denotes the mass of the electrode material on the positive and negative electrodes (g), C represents the specific capacitance and ΔV denotes the applied potential window. With the increment in scan rate ranging from 5 to 100 mV s−1, the CV graph exhibits a regular pattern symbolizing the supercapacitive behavior. Galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) was also carried out to determine the specific capacitance of the constructed asymmetric supercapacitor at varying current densities. Excellent capacitance behavior is evidenced by the symmetric profile of the charge/discharge cycles. Table 3 displays the specific capacitance, energy density, and power density of the Bi2Mo3O12 asymmetric device. The specific capacitance at 1 A g−1 was determined to be 152 F g−1. The pristine Bi2Mo3O12 illustrates a maximum energy density of 47.5 W h kg−1 and a power density of 750 W kg−1.

Furthermore, the asymmetric supercapacitor demonstrates high cycle stability, a significant aspect of practical applications. Stability constraints were eliminated, and stability behavior was assessed using a swagelok-type device. The fast kinetics of the electrode/electrolyte interaction reduced the initial stability.62,63 The selected electrode maintained a capacitive retention rate of 71.90% at 5 A g−1 with an excellent coulombic efficiency (η) of 98.51% after 10 000 cycles. The current ASC device preparation using Bi2Mo3O12 is compared with other materials in Table 4. This study highlights Bi2Mo3O12 as the ideal active material for supercapacitor applications because it has the highest energy density and power density while maintaining strong cyclic stability.

Bi2Mo3O12 samples show higher specific capacitance, power density, and energy density than other samples like Bi2Mo2O9 and Bi2MoO6. Based on BET analysis, Bi2Mo3O12 exhibits higher pore volume and diameter than other structures. The higher electrochemical performance may be due to their pore volume and diameter. The specific capacitance value was also increased with increasing Mo ratio in the Bi2MoxOy structure. With this result, the molybdenum ratio of the Bi2MoxOy material heavily influences the electrochemical performance.
4. Conclusion
In summary, a comparison of the distinct phases of bismuth molybdates α-Bi2Mo3O12, β-Bi2Mo2O9, and γ-Bi2MoO6 for supercapacitor application was accomplished. The phase formation and purity of the as-prepared samples were confirmed from XRD analysis. The SEM and TEM images of α-Bi2Mo3O12, β-Bi2Mo2O9, and γ-Bi2MoO6 display distinct morphologies and confirm the self-assembled particles and porous assembly. The mesoporous nature of the prepared Bi2MoxOy material was confirmed using BET analysis, and molybdenum-rich samples showed increasing pore volume and diameter. Various characterization techniques were used to ascribe their optical and electrical properties. Electrochemical analyses such as CV, GCD, and EIS affirmed the behaviors of the bismuth molybdate samples. After 5000 cycles, the α-Bi2Mo3O12 phase evidenced superior electrochemistry with a high specific capacitance of 714 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1 and increased stability of 86.55%. An asymmetric device constructed with the preferred Bi2Mo3O12 electrode displayed 152 F g−1 specific capacitance at 1 A g−1. The results of the Bi2Mo3O12-prepared asymmetric device show that it has a maximum power density of 750 W kg−1 and an energy density of 47.5 W h kg−1. The stability test emphasizes that the chosen electrode has an excellent capacitive retention rate of 71.90% after 10000 cycles. The cost-effective synthesis method combined with the novel electrochemical performance of bismuth molybdates might be an effective electrode material in high-performance supercapacitor applications.
