1. Introduction
Solar energy is one of the most promising alternatives to meet world energy demands.1,2 In this regard, PSCs have emerged as a very promising new type of photovoltaic technology due to their low-cost, ease of fabrication and high power conversion efficiency (PCE) above 22%, which is higher than that obtained with polycrystalline silicon, while using 1000 times less light harvesting material.3–8
Perovskites with general formula ABX3, where A is a monovalent cation, methylammonium (MA) or formamidinium (FA), B is Pb(II) and X is a halogen (chlorine, bromine or iodide), are the most investigated materials (Fig. 1a and b).8–10 These perovskite materials exhibit very interesting properties, such as tunable bandgaps, high absorption coefficients, long charge carrier (electron–hole) diffusion lengths, and low-temperature solution processability.11–14 The exceptional properties of these materials allow for the fabrication of devices either with the regular n–i–p or the inverted p–i–n configurations (p refers to a p-type semiconductor, n to an n-type semiconductor, and i to an undoped semiconductor).3,10,15 The latter has recently attracted more attention due to the relatively simple device architecture and low-temperature manufacturing process that make them suitable for commercial applications.16,17

Herein, we focus on the recent advances that enable the high photovoltaic performance and long-term stability of PSCs through: processing of the perovskite films, some approaches based on their composition (presence of additives), the use of fullerene derivatives in different device architectures (regular and inverted), and the results of calculations based on the perovskite/fullerene interface. These lead to final considerations to design optimally performing fullerenes. Finally, we outline some perspectives on how to further advance PSCs for large-scale and commercial applications. There are other reviews that describe in more detail the different perovskite structures,2 working principles,18 photophysics,19 chemical and thermal stability,9,20 deposition techniques,21,22 and comparison with other photovoltaic technologies.8
2. Device structures
PSCs have been traditionally fabricated with mesoscopic and planar heterojunction structures (Fig. 1). The mesoscopic structures (Fig. 1c) are composed of fluorinated-doped tin oxide (FTO), a mesoporous metal oxide scaffold that works as an electron transporting material (ETM) such as titanium oxide (TiO2) or aluminum oxide (Al2O3), the perovskite material, which can infiltrate into the mesoporous scaffold or be used as a capping layer on top of the ETM, and a hole transporting material (HTM) such as spiro-OMeTAD, and a metal contact (Ag or Au) electrode.10 Later, it was found that PSCs can also be fabricated with planar configurations (Fig. 1d and e) for which efficiencies above 20% have been reported.23–26
The planar configurations include regular (n–i–p)25 and inverted (p–i–n)15 devices. For these devices, the hole and electron transporting layers are crucial because they determine the polarity of the device, improve stability, passivate surface charge traps, and help charge extraction and transport from the active layer to the electrodes.27–30
The best performing devices thus far are those based on mesoscopic structures (22.1% PCE).31 However, it is worth noting that the efficiencies of planar devices have also improved to certified values of 21.04%, and the fabrication of planar devices is relatively easier compared to those of TiO2-based mesoporous devices.26
3. Deposition- and solution-processed perovskite thin films
There are many reported procedures to deposit the organic–inorganic perovskite material, each based on the same principle – the reaction of an organic material (MAI or FAI) and an inorganic material (PbI2, PbBr2 or PbCl2) that yield different crystalline and film quality, and different degrees of surface coverage. It has been reported that pin hole free perovskite layers highly improve device performance.6,19 One area of focus for improving device efficiencies is the optimization of film crystallinity. Two different methodologies have shown high quality, uniform and smooth thin films; vapor deposition and solution processing techniques, see below.
3.1 Vapor-assisted film deposition methods
The vapor-assisted method for perovskite film formation was introduced by Liu et al.33 who achieved an efficiency of over 15% for planar PSCs (Fig. 2a). In this dual-source method, MAI and PbI2 are heated at 120 °C and 325 °C, respectively, and deposited on a TiO2 layer under high vacuum. Using this method, Momblona et al.34 reported PCEs up to 20% for n–i–p and 16.5% for p–i–n configurations. This technique offers a uniform layer (∼500 nm), grain sizes in the nanometer scale, pin-hole free perovskite films and the ability to prepare multi-stack thin films. A variant of this method is the deposition of the perovskite at low temperature by a vapor-assisted solution process (Fig. 2b). The as-prepared PbI2 layer is treated with MAI (vapor) under a N2 atmosphere for 2 h. The perovskite film derived from this approach exhibits full surface coverage, uniform grain structure with grain sizes up to micrometers, and 100% precursor transformation completeness.35 The vapor-assisted deposition techniques have been reviewed in more detail by Ono et al.21

3.2 Solution methods
Despite the good results obtained with the vapor-deposition techniques, most research has been focused on solution methods because they offer more alternatives for preparing perovskite films at relatively low temperatures. The solution methods can be categorized into one-step and two-step Fig. 2c, d and e–g, respectively. Solution deposition methods have been reviewed in more detail by Zhou et al.22 and Liu et al.15

3.2.1 One-step. 
In this method stoichiometric amounts of the precursors (organo-halide and metal-halide) are mixed to form the perovskite solution,36 which is spin coated directly onto the substrate followed by an annealing process at 100 to 150 °C (Fig. 2c). High performing devices can be fabricated using different MAI:PbI2 composition ratios from 1:2 to 4:1, respectively.37–39 Lee et al.40 reported for the first time that devices prepared by the one-step solution method can achieve 10.9% PCE values. Since then, many advanced solvent engineering techniques have been developed and efficiencies above 20% have been achieved.25,41–43
The one-step is the simplest technique for preparing perovskite thin films, however the morphological control for the perovskite films based on this method is challenging44 and the incorporation of additives such as DMSO,45,46 1,8-diiodooctane47 (DIO), HI48 and HBr49 to slow down crystal growth to improve the surface morphology of spin-coated perovskite films has been employed (Fig. 2d).
On the contrary, Jeon et al.50 have reported that the addition of an antisolvent that does not dissolve the perovskite films, such as toluene, on top of the wet perovskite film during spin-coating results in fast crystallization. Thus, a dense perovskite film can form uniformly across the substrate. The addition of other antisolvents such as chlorobenzene, benzene, diethyl ether and xylene have also been reported.42,51,52


3.2.2 Two-step. 
In 2013, Burschka et al.53 first reported the application of this method for PSCs fabrication and a PCE of 15% was achieved. Typically, in this method a PbI2 layer is converted into MAPbI3 by dipping the substrate into a MAI solution,53 spin coating MAI on top of the PbI2 layer54 (Fig. 2f and g) or by exposing the PbI2 film to a MAI vapor atmosphere35 (Fig. 2b). High quality and more reproducible perovskite films can be prepared using this method. Additionally, varying the concentration of the MAI solution, the perovskite grain sizes can be improved.54 Using the two-step method, Yang et al.55 have reported efficiencies exceeding 20%. The addition of additives to control the formation of the perovskite film by this method has also been extensively studied (Fig. 2e).42,56,57

4. The use of fullerenes in PSCs
In 2013, fullerene C60 (1) and its derivatives phenyl-C60-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) (2) and tetrahydro-di[1,4]methanonaphthaleno[5,6]fullerene-C60 (3) indene bis adduct (ICBA) (Fig. 3) were introduced into PSCs for the first time by Jeng et al.60 and PCEs of 3.0, 3.9 and 3.4% were achieved, respectively, when used as ETMs. Recently, Grätzel24 and co-workers reported efficiencies above 20% for an inverted PSC device with the configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/perovskite/PC71BM (4)/CaAl, whereas a PCE of 18.5% was reported by Huang61 and coworkers for a PSC device based on a pure ICBA isomer (trans-3) (5) (Fig. 3). It has been widely demonstrated that the use of fullerenes either as ETMs, interface modification of the ETM1,16,30,62–109 or as additives43,69,92,110–114 in the perovskite layer can play an important role in passivating the charge traps at the surfaces and grain boundaries of the thin films, which significantly reduces the hysteresis and leads to higher device performances. Additionally, fullerenes can also act as a barrier for moisture, thus enhancing long-term stability and also as a template for perovskite crystal growth and to decrease or even completely avoid ion migration.115
 Fig. 3  Structures of the fullerene derivatives used as ETMs in PSCs. 
In recent years much work has been dedicated to reduce the hysteretic J–V behavior in hybrid perovskite devices. One phenomenon believed to contribute to this behavior is the creation of charge trap states at layer interfaces and crystal grain boundaries within devices. Work done by Wojciechowsk et al.85 has shown the usefulness of fullerene derivatives in reducing charge trap/de-trapping processes in PSC devices, which contribute significantly to this behavior.
When considering the effect of fullerenes on the performance of a PSCs, electronic properties should not be the only factors examined. Indeed, morphology of the fullerene and the fullerene/surface layer has been shown to be an important parameter for the quality of the PSC characteristics. Some fullerene derivatives can form dimers and polymers in the device layers, rather than discrete molecular species. Huemueller et al.116 studied the effect of polymeric fullerenes on device efficiencies and stabilities. Their study showed a direct correlation between the amount of polymerized fullerene and Jsc/Voc efficiency losses. In addition, the authors reported an annealing method that allows the polymerization of the photoactive layer while still maintaining monomeric crystallinity of the fullerene species. With their proposed process, fullerenes are more evenly dispersed in the polymer layer, thus reducing the likelihood of fullerene to fullerene exciton driven dimerization. Along the same lines, Lin et al.117 found that by promoting PC61BM aggregation into large domains within the ETL by using a block co-polymer (PS-b-PEO) with a large disparity in polarity, they could improve the electron transport ability. Although PC61BM aggregation did not lead to crystallinity in the ETL, by controlling the amount of block co-polymer, the authors were able to tune the phase separation in the ETL and improve the PCE by 4% relative to the control devices. Beyond the morphological considerations of the fullerene/perovskite layers, fullerene functionalization can also have a remarkable effect on device performance.
4.1 Fullerenes as compact layers
Fullerenes and their derivatives are the most used n-type ETMs in inverted PSCs due to their efficient electron transporting and solution processable properties, low temperature fabrication, suitable energy level alignment with that of the perovskites, and acceptable electron mobilities.118,119 Besides PC61/71BM68,78,80,120 (2 and 4, Fig. 3) or PC61BM as additives,1,84 other fullerene derivatives have also been used as efficient ETMs in PSCs (Fig. 3).62–64,66,70,72,74,76,85,90,108,121–124 To date, it is still not fully understood why fullerenes and their derivatives act so well as ETMs in PSCs. In this section, we review the most import findings based on PC61/71BM and different fullerene derivatives that have been synthesized to study the role of the functional group.
Recently, we reported the synthesis and photovoltaic applications of DMEC60 and DMEC70, compounds 6 and 7, respectively (Fig. 3). We found that inverted PSCs based on 6 or 7 as ETMs exhibited both higher PCE and higher device-stability compared to devices based on the PC61/71BM. These results were attributed to the ability of the DMEC60/70 to extract electrons more efficiently, likely due to specific interactions between the pyrrolidine groups (carbonyls and amino groups) and the perovskite crystals at the interfaces, as determined by infrared (IR) spectroscopy.62,125 Due to the suitable energy levels and good electron mobility of PC61BM-dimers, they have been used as efficient electron acceptors in organic solar cells OSCs.126,127 Taking this into account, we have reported,63 for the first time, the use of a PC61BM-dimer, (D-C60) compound 8 (Fig. 3), as the ETM in inverted PSCs. The results showed improved PCE and device stability as compared to devices based on PC61BM. This improved performance was attributed to effective perovskite film surface passivation as well as improved electron extraction and transport efficiency, as determined by photoluminescence (PL) techniques and electrochemical impedance (EIS). Han et al.123 reported the use of a blend composed of PC61BM:PC61BM-dimer (d-PC61BM, compound 9) with a 4:1 ratio, respectively, to control the morphology and the electron transporting ability of the ETL. Higher PCEs were obtained from the mix-based devices compared to those for the pure PC61BM-based devices.
Xing et al.64 synthesized several C60 and C70 fullerene derivatives functionalized with oligoether chains, compounds 10–14 (Fig. 3), and used as ETMs to study trap passivation mechanisms in inverted PSCs. These new materials are good candidates for replacing PC61/71BM layers. The results show that the length of the oligoether chains affect the energy levels, charge carrier mobilities, surface energy and dipole layer features at the interfaces. In many cases, improved device performance has been attributed to the fullerene design for both electronic and morphological reasons. Meng et al.70 reported that by using C5-NCMA, compound 15 (Fig. 3), as the ETM in inverted PSCs, both higher efficiencies and longer device-stabilities, as compared to those of PC61BM-based devices, were achieved. The high PCE values were attributed to the high electron mobility, efficient charge extraction and improved electron transport ability of 15 (Fig. 3). The Improved stabilities of devices based on 15 was mainly due to its hydrophobicity. Dai et al.124 investigated the effects of EDNC and BDNC compounds 16 add 17, respectively, as the ETM in PSCs. 16-based devices exhibited higher PCEs than 17-based devices and the results were attributed to the smoother surface morphology of the films with 17. The electron mobility of PC61BM is approximately one order of magnitude higher than that of 16 and 17, which yielded higher Jsc and FF when compared to 16-based devices, thus demonstrating the importance of electron mobility, as well as surface morphology, on fullerene-based PSCs. Similarly, Zhang et al.128 reported that due to the low electron mobility of compounds 18–20 (Fig. 3), charge carriers can accumulate at the perovskite/fullerene interface, leading to an electric field that gives rise to the notorious hysteretic behavior. By replacing the methyl group of the PC61BM for the 2-ethylhexyl group of PC61BEH (compound 21, Fig. 3), it was found that PC61BEH exhibits increased solubility without affecting the electron mobility nor the HOMO/LUMO energy levels, which resulted in improved overall device performance.103
One common issue in PSCs is the light-soaking-effect (performance variation under illumination). To address this phenomenon Shao et al.72 studied how fullerene derivatives with different dielectric constants (compound 22, dielectric constant 5.9) (Fig. 3) can eliminate the light-soaking-effect. As shown in Fig. 4, the photo-generated electrons are injected into the ETL, where they are either collected by the cathode or captured by surface traps, resulting in non-radiative recombination (rc). The latter can be determined using eqn (1): (1)where q, T, ε0 and εr are the elementary charge, temperature, vacuum permittivity and the dielectric constant of the ETM, respectively. The electrons that are within rc distance have higher probability to be trapped. From eqn (1), the higher the εr the smaller the rc.

Erten-Ela et al.66 reported the synthesis and application of the benzoic acid fullerene bis-adduct 23 (Fig. 3). Although the PCE for devices based on this compound are not better than for PC61BM-based devices, higher Jsc values were obtained when 22 was used as the ETM in PSCs. The effect of the PC61BM- and indene-alkyl chain (compounds 24–27) (Fig. 3) as the ETM in PSCs was studied by Gil-Escrig et al.106 The derivatives with longer alkyl chain (compounds 25 and 27) led to improved layers with fewer defects than those obtained with PC61BM. As expected, indene-based devices exhibited higher Voc than those of PC61BM-like based devices, which is attributed to the energetically high-lying LUMO levels. An indene bis-adduct derivative, compound 28 (Fig. 3) was used as the ETM in PSCs by Xue et al.108 Compared to PC61BM-28-based devices exhibited higher Voc and higher overall performance, which was mainly attributed to the higher energy LUMO value of 28. Chang et al.74 reported that IBF-Ep compound 29 (Fig. 3) can be used as the ETM in both regular and inverted PSCs, though better results were obtained when 29 (Fig. 3) was used in inverted structures. Wolff et al.90 investigated how fullerenes 1, 2 and 30 (Fig. 3) affect the Voc values in inverted PSCs, when a thin layer of an insulator polymer is in between the perovskite and the ETM interface. The results showed that the insulator interlayer reduces the recombination process and improves the electron extraction from the perovskite layer, which is more effective than raising the LUMO level of the ETMs (compound 30) (Fig. 3). The influence of additives in the fullerene layer has also been studied. It was reported that the addition of polystyrene (PS) into the PC61BM solution, leads to the formation of a smooth and uniform ETL, resulting in an improved overall device performance.84 When cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) was added into the PC61BM layer, good film coverage was observed, and both improved PCE values and device stabilities were obtained. This approach was also used to fabricate large-area devices (1.2 cm2) to prove the applicability of the method.129 Pyridine,130 graphdiyne,131 hexamethonium bromide,129 cetyltrimethylammonium bromide,129 1,3-dimethyl-2-phenyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-benzoimidazole (DMBI),132 reduced graphene oxide133 and oleamide134 have also been used as an additive to improve electron mobility, decrease series resistance and smooth the surface of the PC61BM layer. Umeyama et al.76 reported for the first time the use of C60 thin films as the ETM in regular PSCs, after thermal retro-Diels–Alder reaction on as-prepared glass/FTO/C60-9-methylanthracene (31) (Fig. 3). Higher fill factor (FF) values and lower charge-transfer resistance from ETM/perovskite interfaces compared with the commonly used TiO2-based devices were obtained. Recently, Wang et al.135 reported that compound 32 (Fig. 3) can be covalently anchored onto the ITO surface, and used as the ETM in regular PSCs as represented in Fig. 5. The main photovoltaic characteristics of PSCs-based on compounds 1–35 are summarized in Table 1.

Compound 32 (Fig. 3) shows good electron mobility and HOMO/LUMO values that match those of the perovskite. Devices based on this compound as the ETM showed negligible hysteretic behavior and a remarkable device stability, achieving maximum PCE values of 18.39% and 17.04% for rigid and flexible devices, respectively. Li et al.136 reported an approach to modulate the fullerene/perovskite interface, which resulted in improved device performance when fullerenes 33–35 (Fig. 3) were used as the ETMs. Fullerenes with excited transfer states (33 and 34) showed almost no fullerene photoluminescence, enhanced molecular polarization and higher electron transport capabilities compared to PC61BM.
4.2 Fullerenes as interfacial modification layers
Although PSCs based on meso-porous TiO2 are leading the race in terms of PCE values, PSCs based on planar structures are becoming more popular due to their simple architecture and lower temperature processability. Lower temperature processed TiO2 can also serve as an ETM in regular PSCs due to its good conduction band match with those of the hybrid perovskites and its deep valence band, which can block the holes.10 However, the low electron mobility of the compact TiO2 layer leads to charge accumulation at the interface, resulting in charge-recombination.137
Snaith and other groups have demonstrated that coating the TiO2 with a thin layer of PC61BM or by modifying the TiO2 surface with a self-assembled monolayer (SAM) of fullerene derivatives (compounds 36–45, Fig. 6), reduces the non-radiative recombination channels at the interface thus reducing the hysteresis and enhancing device performance.79,85–87,91,95,98,102,105,138,139 The SAMs not only provide a valuable reference to explore the fundamentals of hysteresis, but also introduce a technical and viable concept to large-area processing of hysteresis-free solar cells. In a similar approach, water soluble fullerene derivatives (compounds 42 and 43, Fig. 6) were deposited between the PC61BM/perovskite layer in regular PSCs.88,96 The second fullerene layer not only improves the wettability of the perovskite film on the ETL but also increases the electron transport ability across the interface between the perovskite and TiO2 layers. To avoid damage of the C60 layer deposited on top of the ITO, the latter was coated with polyethylenimine ethosylated (PEIE) to keep the integrity of the C60 film.67 Results showed that the ETL is an effective template to grow high-quality MAPbI3-based perovskite layers.

When PC61BA, compound 44 (Fig. 6), was used as an interfacial modification monolayer between the perovskite/c-TiO2 interface, a PCE improvement was observed, from 7.46% without the fullerene derivative to 17.76% for 44-based devices under reverse scan.105
When compound 45 was used as a monolayer it led to effective passivation of the trap sites on the c-TiO2, reduced the hole recombination at the cTiO2/perovskite interface, facilitated the electron extraction and improved the morphology of the perovskite film, which led to a better overall device performance.105 Kegelmann et al.107 reported the influence of 1, 2 and 45 as interfacial modifiers on PSCs. It was found that only the ETL double layer (TiO2/PC61BM) led to higher efficiency with negligible photocurrent hysteresis, which can be attributed to reduction of shunt paths through the fullerene to the ITO layer, decreased transport losses and improved hole blocking by the wide band gap metal oxide.
4.3 Fullerenes as additives
Huang and coworkers73,140 demonstrated that the spun PC61BM layer can permeate into the perovskite layer throughout the grain boundaries during the annealing process below 100 °C (Fig. 7a). Xu et al.110 showed the formation of a PC61BM radical by UV-Vis spectroscopy. These results suggest that PC61BM is passivating the iodide trap sites on the surface grains. As shown in Fig. 7b, iodide reacts with PC61BM or C60 to form a bond by direct electron transfer to the fullerene. Different approaches have been developed to modify the morphology of perovskite solar films, aimed at improving stability and large-scale production capability. The main photovoltaic characteristics of PSCs based on compounds 36–56 are summarized in Table 2.

The use of fullerenes as additives within the perovskite solution,52,69,92,111,112,141–144 in chlorobenzene as antisolvent43,113 or by immersion of the as-prepared perovskite thin films into a fullerene solution,65 has shown remarkable FFs up to 86.7%, negligible hysteretic behavior, improved long-term-device stability, and last but not least, high PCE values for large-area-based devices. Fullerene derivatives 46–56 used as additives are shown in Fig. 8.
 Fig. 8  Structure of fullerene derivatives used as perovskite-additives. 
4.4 Fullerenes as cathode buffer layers, cross-linkable and double layers
The role of a cathode buffer layer in PSCs is to improve the metal electrode efficiency in collecting charge carriers. As discussed above fullerenes are excellent ETMs. However, a barrier exists at the contact interface between the Fermi level of different metal electrodes such as Al, Ag or Au and the LUMO of the fullerenes, which leads to poor electron injection and extraction. To minimize this barrier a quasi-ohmic contact at the fullerene/metal interface is needed.145–150
Jen's and Huang's groups, among others, have reported the use of different double fullerene layers to improve device performance in PSCs (compounds 57–60, Fig. 9).16,73,80,81,89,101,140,151–153 Cross linkable fullerene derivatives (36, Fig. 6 and 61–63, Fig. 9) that enhance water and moisture stability have been reported,71,75,93 as well as the use of fullerene salts (58, 64 and 65, Fig. 9),77,80,97 and polymers (66, Fig. 9)94,99,154 to reduce the work function of the metal electrodes and prevent degradation caused by humidity.

5. Calculations of the perovskite/fullerene interface
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and molecular dynamic (MD) simulations have been used to study the interfacial energy alignment and charge transfer properties at the perovskite/organic interface.110,157–159 Yin et al.157 reported an experimental and theoretical study of the energy level alignment and charge transfer properties at the perovskite/PC61BM interface. Theoretical results agree well with experimental ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurements, showing that the polar CH3NH3PbI3 (100) surface facilitates electron transfer to PC61BM largely delocalized surface states and orbital coupling (Fig. 10a). Xu et al.110 confirmed the strong PC61BM–iodide interaction using DFT calculations. It was found that the wavefunction of the ground state was hybridized between the perovskite/PC61BM interface (Fig. 10b). Quarti et al.158 reported that the electronic energy alignment and charge transfer from the perovskite to C60 depend on the perovskite surface termination. The conduction band edge (CBE) of the MAI-terminated perovskite lies above the LUMO of the C60, allowing a spontaneous charge transfer of the photogenerated electron into the C60, while the CBE of the PbI-terminated perovskite lies below the LUMO of the C60, avoiding electron injection (Fig. 10c). Taufique et al.159 performed MD simulations of PC61BM solvated in chlorobenzene near the (100) and (110) perovskite surface. PC61BM showed orientational preferences in which the carbonyl oxygen atoms interact with the Pb and H atoms of (100) and (110) faces of perovskite (Fig. 10d).

6. Device Stability
6.1 Humidity, oxygen and light exposure
One of the external factors that affects the stability of PSCs is humidity. Exposure of the device to the atmosphere can completely degrade it in just a few days, even when stored in the dark. Yang et al.160 reported that the degradation rate is affected not only by the relative humidity (RH) but also by the nature of the HTM. Christians et al.161 reported that the degradation of the perovskite starts with the formation of a hydrate at the perovskite surface, and then propagates through the entire perovskite layer161 as represented in eqn (2).
Additionally, Leguy et al.163 found that the degradation process occurs in two steps and is water exposure dependent (Fig. 11). When heat is combined with moisture, unlike the previous processes, it leads to a complete irreversible degradation of the perovskite layer, yielding PbI2 and the degraded organic counterpart.164 CH3NH3PbI3 + H2O → (CH3NH3)4PbI6·2H2O(2)
 Fig. 11  Hydration process for the perovskite film. Reproduced with permission.162 Copyright 2017, American Chemical Society. 
Several studies have tried to overcome these problems and increase device stability under atmospheric conditions. Noh et al.11 reported that the use of Br− as the halide in the perovskite film strengthens the hydrogen bonding between CH3NH3+ and [PbI6]4− and avoids the formation of hydrates. Similar work, done by Jiang et al.165,166 introduced SCN− instead of Br− to increase device stabilities. With this modification, no degradation of the device was observed under conditions up to 70% RH. Another strategy to improve device stability relies on the use of fullerene derivatives, which have high hydrophobicity and form compact self-assembled layers, thus avoiding water insertion and subsequent device degradation.70,74 Oxygen also influences device degradation, it oxidizes the organic material in the cell, but unlike moisture degradation, oxygen can have a greater effect when exposed to light.167,168 This phenomenon has been observed to occur by a well-studied photo-oxidation process.169 This process is dominated by electron transfer and oxidation rates. Oxidation of the semiconductor is prevalent except for the case when the electron transfer rate is dominant.164,169 The mechanism by which the perovskite degrades in the presence of oxygen and light is represented in eqn (3)–(5).162,170 When light strikes the perovskite, it forms a non-equilibrated population of electrons and holes (eqn (3)).
Then electrons from the conduction band form a superoxide anion with the adsorbed oxygen from the atmosphere (eqn (4)). Finally, methylammonium cation is deprotonated and the iodide anion is oxidized by the superoxide anion (eqn (5)).162,170 Aristidou et al.13 reported that the O2˙− formation rate can be decreased by using interlayers that are able to extract electrons from the perovskite film before they can react with the oxygen to form the superoxide.170,171 To date, the best way to delay the degradation process caused by moisture and oxygen is by device encapsulation.9,162,164 (3) (4) (5)
6.2 Thermal instability
To understand the thermal decomposition, different parameters have been considered.172–174 Yang et al.175 reported that after heating the perovskite layer decomposes to generate PbI2 in one step. It has also been reported that decomposition depends on the heating time, applied temperature and the nature of the ETL, as shown in Fig. 12a and b.175–177 Device decomposition was characterized by XRD studies.17–20 The mechanism represented in eqn (6) and (7) was proposed to explain the degradation process due to temperature.162,178 It was reported that degradation can also occur at 100 °C and without exposure to moisture.179,180 Recent reports showed that decomposition can occur in the absence of humidity.170,171,181 Decomposition is accelerated in the presence of light and oxygen as shown in eqn (2)–(4).162,170 OH− + CH3NH3I → CH3NH3OH + I−(6) (7)

6.3 Fullerenes and their role in device stability
As discussed before, device stability is a very important factor for PSCs. In this regard the use of fullerene derivatives to restrict water intrusion, and thus prevent degradation at the interfaces and to passivate the grain boundaries in the perovskite layer even at high temperature (85 °C), is a good strategy to extend the integrity of the PSCs-based devices. Zang et al.43 reported that PSCs fabricated using α-bis-PCBM, compound 56 (Fig. 8), as an additive exhibited a very substantial stability increase. As shown in Fig. 13a56-based PSCs kept 90.1% of their initial PCE after 44 days at 64 °C without encapsulation, compared to 72.6% and 45.4% for devices fabricated with PC61BM and without fullerene, respectively, under the same conditions. Collavini et al.114 reported the use of fullerenes functionalized with polyethylenglycol (PEG) groups, compounds 53–55 (Fig. 8), as additives in PSCs. The fullerene–PEG derivates can interact with water by hydrogen bonding and thus inhibit the water intrusion into the perovskite layer. As shown in Fig. 13b and c, PSCs-based on 53–55 exhibited increased stability with respect to the reference device (without fullerene) at 97%, 81% and 94% of the initial PCE, respectively, after 13 days of ambient exposure. The enhanced stability was attributed to the fullerene's addend rather than the fullerene cage, as PSCs-based on C60 showed no improved stability compared with the control (Fig. 13d).

7. Considerations for the synthesis of new fullerene derivatives
There has been considerable progress in the use of fullerenes to improve the performance of PSCs. Many reported fullerenes perform better that the standard PC61BM, yet there is no in-depth knowledge of the role of the fullerene or de addends in PSCs performance. Using recently reported works as a guide, here we list some important considerations for the synthesis of new fullerenes to be used in PSCs.
Compared to inorganic ETMs, fullerenes are an excellent alternative for the fabrication of PSCs due to their solubility in organic solvents, which allows device fabrication at a relative low temperature (below 100 °C). This allows the fabrication of flexible devices using these materials.135
We and other groups103,106 have studied the effect of the fullerene addend on the performance of PSCs. It has been shown that fullerene solubility can be enhanced by attaching longer alkyl chains, which improves film morphology, and increases both passivation and electron extraction ability. The challenge is to add a group that induces high fullerene solubility without interrupting other important properties such as electron mobility. Unfortunately, in many cases solubility is accompanied by lower electron mobilities.128,182 It is well known that fullerenes (10−3–10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) have 3–5 orders of magnitude lower electron mobility than perovskites (6–200 cm2 V−1 s−1),183 which affects the series resistance and FF. In this regard solubility and electron mobility need to be balanced when designing and synthesising new fullerene derivatives for PSCs.
Improvement of the Voc values has been extensively studied60,106,108 and typically, fullerenes with lower LUMO energy exhibit higher Voc values. It has also been reported that the energy disorder in the ETL influences the Voc. In this regard, a simple solvent annealing method to mitigate the energy disorder in the ETL that results in an improved Voc was reported.73 It was also found that the isomeric purity or a tuned isomeric mixture of fullerenes in the ETL has a considerable impact on the Voc, and this effect can even reverse the expected results based solely on HOMO/LUMO energy level considerations.120,125
The long-term device stability has been improved using hydrophobic fullerenes, which minimize the penetration of water into the perovskite layer in inverted PSCs. We probed this concept by designing a PC61BM dimer that has similar energy levels and electron mobility but higher hydrophobicity than the monomer PC61BM, resulting in an improved device-stability when the dimer was used as the ETM in inverted PSCs.63
Functionalization of fullerenes with groups that may have specific interactions with the perovskite material is another important consideration. We have reported that fullerenes functionalized with amino- and/or carbonyl groups can coordinate with the perovskite material and lead to enhanced device performance and long-term device stability.62,125 It has also been reported that the crystal surface vacancies on the perovskites can be significantly passivated using organic Lewis bases such as thiophene and pyridine.184 We hypothesize that fullerenes decorated with these moieties should yield interesting results.
8. Summary and perspectives
PCEs based on both regular and inverted PSC configurations have exceeded 20%, the latter using fullerene derivatives as the ETMs. Several fullerene derivatives with higher electron mobilities and hydrophobic properties, have been designed for improving device performance as well as device stability. By tuning the physical and chemical properties of fullerenes, enhanced charge extraction and transport capabilities were obtained.
By decreasing the structural disorder of fullerene derivatives layers, inverted PSCs with an improved Voc comparable with that of TiO2-based PSCs, can be fabricated. It is worth mentioning that PSCs based on fullerenes as the ETMs, perform better at eliminating the J–V hysteresis and can be fabricated at relatively low-temperature compared with those that use TiO2 as the ETM.
PSCs are commercially promising because of their solution processable properties and high PCE values. Recent developments have shown that solution-based device fabrication can be achieved with high throughput, making PSC construction more industrially viable.185 Large area devices, crucial to commercialization of PSCs, have also recently seen remarkable breakthroughs, with device sizes reaching 36 cm2 with corresponding efficiencies of 12.07%.186 Though still in its infancy as a technology, fullerene containing PSCs have shown to be a possible way forward toward commercialization of such devices as they are considerably more stable and thus more practical for real world applications.
Although a tremendous progress has been made toward increasing PCE values and device stability of PSCs, there are still many barriers to further overcome to compete with the inorganic-based solar cells that currently lead the market.
One of the main concerns for commercializing this technology is the long-term stability. PSCs have been exposed to drastic conditions such as long-time light-soaking conditions in the presence of air, and several research studies have been devoted to their stability under atmospheric conditions.7,187–192 Cost-wise, less expensive organic materials are being used either as the ETMs or HTMs, which has motivated the research community to design new efficient materials.
Given the current trajectory of progress in this field of study, we foresee the development of new fullerene based PSC devices that will soon find commercial viability and rival older silicon based technology for market supremacy.
