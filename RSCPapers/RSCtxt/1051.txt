    , Accepted 23rd January 2022First published on 29th January 2022AbstractPerovskite light-emitting diodes (PeLEDs) have attracted much attention in the past few years due to their excellent photoelectric performance. Owing to the advantages of adjustable bandgaps, high photoluminescence quantum yields, and excellent charge transfer properties, PeLEDs have emerged as next-generation candidates for use in light-emitting devices. However, efficiency and stability issues have always been problems restricting their development. Different approaches such as device structure optimization, interface engineering, solvent engineering, annealing treatment, additive engineering, and humidity control have been recently reported for overcoming the challenges facing PeLEDs. In this review, solvent-based strategies for obtaining high-performance perovskite light-emitting diodes are the main topic of discussion. In addition, an outlook focusing on solvent-based strategies to further enhance the performances of PeLEDs is proposed.
1. Introduction
Since the Industrial Revolution, displays and lighting have been integral parts of people's lives. Since entering the 21st century, researchers have been trying to develop new display and lighting technologies and a lot of breakthroughs have been achieved. Various technologies have emerged, such as CRT technology,1–3 LCD technology,4–6 and OLEDs.7–9 At present, OLEDs are a mainstream component in the display device market, with advantages such as high efficiency, high color saturation, and flexibility.7,10,11 However, due to their shortcomings, such as high production costs, short service lifetimes and low yields, the development of OLEDs has entered a bottleneck.12
In recent years, organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites, as a new semiconductor material, have gained great attention in the scientific research community. They have been widely used in laser detection, solar cells, light-emitting devices, photodetectors, and other optoelectronic devices.13–16 The first breakthrough in perovskite-related research was reported in the field of solar cells. The typical semiconductor structure of a perovskite material consists of a crystal film with virtually no defects, demonstrating long-distance charge transfer and efficient charge collection, resulting in a solar cell with performance comparable to that based on crystalline silicon.15,17 Within a few years, the power conversion efficiencies of perovskite solar cells exceeded 25%.18 According to the equilibrium equation, the Shockley–Queisser limit of 33.5% can be reached only when the external luminous efficiency of a solar cell is close to 100%, which means that an excellent solar cell material is also an excellent light-emitting material.19 In 2014, the luminescence of the solution-treated CH3NH3PbX3 perovskite was reported at room temperature.20 Upon further research, researchers found that perovskite materials are suitable for the preparation of light-emitting diodes due to their adjustable bandgaps, high photoluminescence quantum yields, and excellent charge transfer performance.21–24 Since then, PeLEDs began to attract the attention of researchers. Moreover, the low-temperature treatment conditions are a very attractive option when it comes to large-area optoelectronic applications compared to the vacuum-based solid-state light-emitting devices currently in use. As a result, there has been a flurry of research in this direction. The field of PeLEDs has grown at a breakneck pace in just a few years. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) values of green, red, and near-infrared PeLEDs have developed rapidly and they now all exceed 20%, reaching the same levels as mature OLEDs currently on the market.25–27 Even the slowest developing blue-ray PeLEDs have EQEs of more than 10%.28–31
Despite the excellent performance of PeLEDs, stability has always been a pressing issue.32–34 Perovskite films prepared via solution-based methods will inevitably develop pores and other defects during the process of preparation, resulting in degraded device performance or short circuiting.35 In addition, most devices are sensitive to water and oxygen and have short working lives under harsh conditions.36 The energy loss at the interface between functional layers in the process of exciton transport can lead to low efficiency and device instability.37 Various strategies, such as structure optimization, interface engineering, solvent engineering, annealing treatment, and additive engineering, have been reported to improve device performance. Out of the above methods, we summarize some meaningful work relating to solvent engineering.
This work provides a comprehensive and systematic review of solvent-based strategies aimed at efficient PeLEDs. In detail, progress relating to solvent-based strategies was reviewed from three main aspects: an introduction to perovskite materials, coordination in the precursor solution, and solvent systems used in the preparation of precursor solutions. Finally, the research status and future directions for the development of solvent-based strategies are summarized.
2. Overview of perovskite materials
At present, perovskite materials are mostly defined in a broad sense, that is, they are ABX3 compounds with a similar structure type to the perovskite mineral CaTiO3. In this formula, A generally refers to Cs+, MA+, FA+, and other large-radius cations; B generally refers to Pb2+, Sn2+, Ni2+, and other types of small-radius cations; and the X anion is generally a halogen element, such as Cl−, Br−, I−, etc. The three-dimensional (3D) structural framework of a perovskite material is shown in Fig. 1a; it is composed of a series of regular BX6 octahedrons with common vertices connected, and the gap surrounded by octahedrons is occupied by an A atom. Treating all of the ions as rigid balls and the structure as tightly packed, the tolerance factor t and octahedral factor μ can be calculated using the following formulae, where RA, RB, and RX represent the radii of the corresponding ions: (1)

These two values can be used to predict the possibility of formation and the stability of a perovskite. In the ranges 0.81 < t < 1.00 and 0.44 < μ < 0.9, a stable three-dimensional perovskite can be formed.43
Low-dimensional perovskites are also important members of the perovskite family, allowing remarkable structural tunability compared to three-dimensional structures. In simple terms, they can be obtained via excising a three-dimensional parent compound, moving from a 3D parent phase structure to a 0D octahedral cluster. Low-dimensional perovskites exhibit different properties due to the limitations of lattice periodicity in one or more dimensions. Perovskite quantum dots (0D) are an example of widely studied low-dimensional perovskites (see Fig. 1b); their grains are encapsulated by organic ligands and are restricted in all three dimensions. Due to quantum confinement effects, perovskite quantum dots have high thermal stability and photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQY >90%).44,45 In 2015, Kovalenko et al. successfully synthesized fully inorganic CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) colloidal quantum dots with finely adjustable sizes and compositions for the first time using a thermal injection method.46
Typical two-dimensional perovskites are composed of layered units. They periodically repeat in planes parallel to the substrate and are confined in the vertical direction, and the layers are filled with organic ligand molecules. Since the energy level difference between the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) in the molecular layer of the organic ligand is larger than the perovskite bandgap, a quantum potential well can form in 2D perovskites,47,48 which can enhance the Coulombic interaction strength between the electron and the hole, thereby increasing the exciton binding energy (Eb).49 In 2016, Sargent et al. first introduced the new concept of 2D perovskites to LED device research, preparing a highly efficient red 2D PeLED with an EQE of 8.8% using phenethylamine (PEA) as the ligand.47 Moreover, quasi-2D perovskites, mixtures of 3D and 2D perovskites, have also been used in PeLEDs. A sky-blue perovskite LED device with good stability was successfully prepared using a quasi-2D strategy, and the brightness reached a record-breaking value of 2480 cd m−2.50
In general, low-dimensional perovskites are formed via the slicing of three-dimensional compounds in different crystal directions. Low-dimensional perovskites obtained via cutting along different directions also show different structures, as shown in Fig. 1c. Low-dimensional perovskite structures involving the binding of 2 layers formed via excising a 3D perovskite structure along different directions are also shown in Fig. 1c. The flexibility and tunability of dimensionality provide the basis for the preparation of crystal structures with varying properties.
3. Coordination in precursor solutions
3.1 Solute complexation interactions in solution
Perovskite precursor solutions are prepared via dissolving lead halide and methylamine halide in polar aprotic solvents. Lead atoms exhibit certain chemical properties due to the presence of a lone pair of electrons in the 6s orbital. When studying coordination compounds in solutions, Kamat et al. studied their specific composition in detail through spectral analysis.41 When PbI2 is dissolved in a solvent, it presents a layered stacked structure along with the (001) direction. Upon the addition of MAI, the van der Waals forces between (001) crystal planes are destroyed, that is, the layered structure of PbI2 is destroyed. As shown in Fig. 1d and e, with an increase in the I− concentration, PbI2 gradually disintegrates, and complex solution chemical reactions occur, as shown in the formula below:51PbI2 + I− ⇐ K1 ⇒ PbI3− PbI3− + I− ⇐ K2 ⇒ PbI42−(2)where Kn is the equilibrium constant. The presence of absorption peaks at 370 nm and 425 nm, as shown in Fig. 1d, demonstrates the complexation between I− and PbI2. However, due to the low solubility of PbI2, higher-order complexes are not formed. A schematic diagram of iodoplumbate complex formation is shown in Fig. 1f.
3.2 Precursor–solvent interactions in solution
Most perovskite materials are prepared from solution due to the unique ionic properties. Therefore, during the preparation of perovskite films via liquid-phase methods, the chemical properties of the precursor solution can directly affect crystal growth, liquid–solid crystallization transition, film formation, and crystal quality. The perovskite precursor solvent can not only dissolve the solute but it can also coordinate with solute molecules as a ligand, having an important influence on the nucleation, growth, and dimensions of perovskite crystals.52 As shown in Fig. 2a, spin-coating, as a simple perovskite deposition method, is widely used to prepare perovskite thin films. The spin-coating process can be divided into two stages: the film-forming process from precursor solution and the solvent evaporation stage. The former is affected by the spin-coating rate and the viscosity of the precursor solvent. The latter depends mainly on the saturated vapor pressure and the saturation solubility of the precursor solution. In conclusion, the perovskite film formation process cannot be explained using classical nucleation theory, considering the above parameters and the effects of solvent coordination.42

Because of the poor solubility of lead halides in nonpolar solvents, the precursor solvent choice is limited to polar aprotic solvents, such as N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).53 Further studies have shown that perovskite precursors, such as lead halides and methylamine halides, coordinate with solvent molecules to form micelles and disperse in the solvent.54 According to electron orbital arrangement theory, the lone pair of electrons in the Pb 6s orbital are easy to lose. Therefore, PbX2 behaves like a Lewis acid. A polar aprotic solvent, such as DMF or DMSO, is a Lewis base due to the existence of electron donors (N, O, and S atoms).55 As is well known, PbX2 dissolved in a solvent has a structure with a layered arrangement. The layers are connected via van der Waals forces, where DMSO and DMF molecules can enter and form coordination compounds. Therefore, when PbX2 is dissolved in DMF or DMSO, coordination intermediates are generated through acid–base reactions.56–58 The solvent molecules are then removed during subsequent annealing to achieve the transition from a mesophase to a perovskite phase.
The growth process of perovskite thin films and the effects of coordination on this were first reported by Seok et al. Taking DMSO, MAI, and PbI2 as examples, a schematic diagram depicting intermediate phase formation is shown in Fig. 2b.59 Later, Park et al. studied the formation of intermediate phases in detail via infrared spectroscopy. As shown in Fig. 2c–e, it was observed that the stretching vibration of SO in the spectrum shifted from 1045 cm−1 (DMSO) to 1020 cm−1 (PbI2·DMSO) and 1015 cm−1 (MAI·PbI2·DMSO), thus confirming the formation of Lewis acid–base intermediate phases of PbI2·DMSO and MAI·PbI2·DMSO, corresponding to the reaction of DMSO with PbI2 and PbI2 + MAI, respectively.55
Due to the complexation interactions involving I− in the halide amine (MAI) and lead halide (PbI2) mentioned above, I− and solvent molecules will competitively coordinate with PbI2 during the formation of coordination complexes, and this will determine the types of coordination compounds present in the perovskite precursor solution. Fig. 2f shows a schematic illustration of the competition between coordination processes in perovskite precursor solution. When coordination between PbI2 and solvent molecules is strong, the formation of iodoplumbate complexes is inhibited, which is conducive to the formation of solvated coordination intermediates. On the contrary, strong coordination between I− and PbI2 is favorable for the formation of the iodoplumbate complexes PbI3− and PbI42−, which promotes the growth of perovskite single crystals.
4. Solvents used in the preparation of precursor solutions
In the spin-coating process, the film-forming stage is mainly affected by the viscosity of the solvent, and the solvent evaporation stage is affected by the saturated vapor pressure and saturation solubility of the solvent. The solubility of the precursor in the solvent and the boiling point and vapor pressure of the solvent can strongly control the crystallization process, thus determining the surface morphology of the film. In addition, differences in the molecular structures of solvents also lead to differences in polarity and coordination abilities, resulting in different intermediate phases. The key physical and chemical properties of commonly used solvents are summarized in Table 1.

4.1 Pure solvents
Furthermore, in the coordination process, the donor number (DN) can be introduced to characterize the ability of a solvent to dissolve cations and Lewis acids.62 Compared with physical quantities proposed previously, such as dielectric constant,63,64 Hansen's solubility parameter,65 and Mayer bond unsaturation,66 DN can more accurately explain the ability of a solvent to coordinate with the Pb2+ center of the lead halide precursor. Solvents with high DN values can easily coordinate with Pb2+, which can inhibit the formation of iodoplumbates and slow the crystallization of perovskites. Solvents with low DN values interact weakly with the Pb2+ center, which is beneficial for complexation between Pb2+ and iodide, thus favoring the crystallization of perovskites.
The choice of solvent for perovskite solar cell (PSC) and perovskite light-emitting diode (PeLED) applications is based on somewhat different principles. The differences between films in PSCs and those in PeLEDs can be attributed to excessive halide use and related changes in the coordination balance in the films. In other words, the mesophases reported in the PV field are unstable in the high-salt PeLED environment. Sun et al. compared the research in the fields of PSCs and PeLEDs. They showed how the addition of molecules can improve the electroluminescence of a perovskite via establishing correlation between the molecular coordination affinity and the crystallization kinetics of the perovskite.67 In this review, unlike previous reports in the photovoltaic field, only solvent studies in the field of PeLEDs are discussed.
Commonly used solvents in precursor solutions include dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), γ-butyrolactone (GBL), and N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP). These solvents, which contain oxygen, sulfur, and nitrogen atoms, act as Lewis bases and can form Lewis acid–base intermediate phases via providing electrons to coordinate with the Lewis acid PbI2 in the precursor solution.68 Based on the above discussion, it can be seen that perovskite coordination effects will significantly affect the perovskite crystallization process. Therefore, via selecting an appropriate solvent to control the strength of coordination during the preparation process, the grain size and dimensions of the product can be effectively controlled to obtain high-quality single-crystal perovskites, polycrystalline films, and quantum dots for different photoelectric applications. Research into solvent effects has been widely reported in photovoltaic fields. However, there are few reports on the effects of solvents on PeLEDs. In the photovoltaic and luminescence fields, solvents with high DN values, such as N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), are often used to prepare perovskite films due to their strong coordination abilities with Pb2+.69–71 In contrast, solvents with low DN values, such as acetonitrile (ACN), tetramethylsulfone (TMS), propyl carbonate (PC), and γ-butyrolactone (GBL), do not easily coordinate with Pb2+, and these solvents are suitable for the growth of single crystals and the synthesis of quantum dots.72–74 Other solvents not mentioned can be used as main solvents to prepare polycrystalline films or as additives to improve the morphologies of films.
Tarasov et al. first studied the lead halide perovskite crystallization process when using GBL solvent, and they observed the morphology characteristics of different intermediate adducts.60 The structures of the intermediate adducts were determined using synchrotron radiation-based single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The observed new intermediate adducts show a similar (MA)2(GBL)2Pb3I8 structure as was observed in DMF and DMSO solvents or they have an unusual (MA)8(GBL)x[Pb18I44] cluster-like structure. As is shown in Fig. 3a and b, three types of intermediate phase are formed during the perovskite crystallization process with GBL as the solvent: (MA)2(GBL)2Pb3I8 (left) and cluster adducts with ordered (MA)8(GBL)x[Pb18I44] (middle) and semi-ordered (right) structures. Similarly, Zhong et al. studied the nucleation and growth of in situ fabricated formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3) nanocrystals and compared the effects of different solvents on the morphologies of FAPbI3 PNC films.61 They found that the FAPbI3 nanocrystals obtained from a precursor solution in γ-butyrolactone (GBL) are smaller than those obtained from precursor solutions in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), as shown in the SEM and TEM images in Fig. 3c. Relatively weak coordination between GBL and the precursor molecules resulted in smaller particle size and a reduced number of defect states in PNCs, thus obtaining high-quality film coverage. Finally, based on a precursor solution in GBL, a bright-red-emitting PeLED with a turn-on voltage of 1.9 V, maximum luminance of 218 cd m−2, and a peak EQE of 15.8% was achieved. On the whole, there are still few reports on solvent strategies for EL devices and further research is needed in this area.

KGaA, Weinheim. 
4.2 Solvent additives (mixed solvents)
Additive engineering is also considered to be an effective way to optimize the morphology of PeLEDs and ultimately improve their electroluminescence (EL) performance.75 In this area, the perovskite precursor solution consists of two or more solvents. In general, the introduction of additives can change many properties of the original solvent and can influence crystallization in many ways, thus reducing the roughness of the film and improving the EL properties.76
As is shown in Fig. 4a, according to the functional groups present, additives can be divided into three types: N donors, O donors, and S donors.42 Studies on the coordination of solvent ligand molecules containing different donors with Pb Lewis acids have been widely reported.77–80 It can be inferred from the above discussion that competition between PbI2·MAI complexes and PbI2·additive complexes can greatly affect the types of complexes present in the perovskite precursor solution. Due to the different coordination abilities (DN) of different solvents, the introduction of an additive solvent can effectively reshape and regulate the coordination interactions in solution, thus controlling the perovskite material crystallization process.

(e) Schematic representations of the crystallization mechanism when a small amount of acid is added.86 Copyright: 2016, Springer Nature Limited. 
Some mixed solvent strategies have been reported in the luminescence field. Recently, Cho and co-workers proposed N,N′-dimethylpropyleneurea (DMPU) as an alternative Lewis base for the preparation of high-quality Sn-based perovskite films.81 The introduction of DMPU to the precursor solution can inhibit the oxidation of Sn2+ and promote the growth of uniform and highly crystalline films. The XPS peaks were analyzed to obtain the ratios of different oxidation states of Sn and I in the films to evaluate the antioxidant capacities of the films, and the results are summarized in Fig. 4b–d. The results showed that DMPU-based film had the lowest Sn4+ and I3− yields, proving that the strong coordinating abilities of the Lewis base DMPU can greatly reduce Sn4+ and I3−, improving the stability of Sn2+ against oxidation. A PEA2SnI4 PeLED device based on film fabricated with DMPU showed superior operational stability.
In addition to their effects on the coordination interactions of precursor solutions, solvent additives also have effects on many other aspects. Wu et al. reported a highly efficient CH3NH3PbBr3 PeLED prepared with chlorobenzene/N,N-dimethylformamide mixed solvent.82 The addition of the precursor non-solvent chlorobenzene reduced the solubility of the precursor, thus increasing the nucleation rate and reducing the grain size. MAPbBr3 film fabricated using a mixed solvent showed better morphological and photoelectrical properties than film fabricated using pure DMF. The experimental results showed that the non-solvent/solvent mixture system could improve the uniformity of film better than a single solvent system. Moreover, researchers found that adding an appropriate amount of acid into the precursor solution during the preparation of single crystals could accelerate the growth rate of single crystals, allowing high-quality single crystals to be obtained.83–85 In further studies, Snait et al. elucidated the mechanism by which acid is added to the precursor solution to accelerate the growth rate of single crystals.86 As is shown in Fig. 4e, in the initial stage, the perovskite precursor mainly existed in the form of a colloid in solution. When acid was added to the system, the added acid induced the protonation of MA to form MAH+, thus causing the gradual destruction of the precursor colloid. Upon the gradual dissolution of the perovskite precursor, the concentration of Pb2+, halogen ions, and MAH+ free ions in solution increased gradually, and when the critical nucleation concentration was reached, nucleation occurred to form perovskite crystals. Based on the above report, Song et al. used a DMF/HBr co-solution to obtain uniformly dense MAPbBr3 film and successfully fabricated efficient PeLEDs.87 The introduction of HBr resulted in perovskite films with uniform and continuous morphologies.
4.3 Anti-solvent
According to classical nucleation theory, only when the precursor solution reaches a supersaturated state can crystal nuclei be formed. Therefore, shortening the time taken for the precursor solution to reach a supersaturated state will increase the nucleation rate, thus generating a large number of initial crystal nuclei and improving the film coverage rate.88,89 An anti-solvent is important in this area to promote nucleation (see Fig. 5a). In the anti-solvent dropping process, via introducing anti-solvent onto the precursor solution film deposited on the substrate, the solvent can be removed from the precursor solution and perovskite precursor film can be induced to supersaturate and precipitate rapidly.90 The effects of anti-solvents on the nuclear dynamics of perovskite solutions and their effects on perovskite crystal growth, film formation, and device performance have been reported in the photovoltaic field.91,92

The rapid crystallization of perovskite films induced using chlorobenzene (CB),93 chloroform (CF),94etc. as anti-solvents during the fabrication of PeLEDs has also been reported. For the first time, the green anti-solvent isopropyl alcohol (IPA) was used by Yu et al. as an anti-solvent to fabricate highly efficient devices, providing an opportunity for low-cost and eco-friendly PeLED manufacturing.95 Compared with CB, the IPA anti-solvent can lead to a larger film coverage area, a smoother surface, and reduced grain size, thus speeding up the carrier recombination process. Moreover, Song et al. investigated the effects of anti-solvents on the formation of perovskite films.96 The anti-solvent dropping method could be used to fabricate a dense and uniform film and improve crystal quality. Among the anti-solvents studied in this research, such as cyclohexane, benzene, toluene, and chlorobenzene, chlorobenzene is the best choice for obtaining high-quality MAPbBr3 film via the solvent dropping process. Cyclohexane has the lowest polarity and could not wash DMSO solution out of the perovskite film, resulting in an island-like morphology, similar to that obtained without solvent dropping. The coverage of MAPbBr3 film when using toluene as the anti-solvent was improved, but there were still holes and pinholes. Continuous and uniform MAPbBr3 perovskite films with good coverage were obtained via anti-solvent dropping utilizing highly polar benzene and chlorobenzene (Fig. 5b). This work provided a method for improving the crystal quality of perovskite films through anti-solvent treatment, which could facilitate the development of high-performance PeLEDs.
In addition to a single anti-solvent, the use of mixed anti-solvents to achieve perovskite films with uniform surface morphology and high crystallinity has also been reported. Meng et al. proposed a cooperative solvent engineering strategy, in which the precursor solvent and antisolvent are modified simultaneously using another solvent to control perovskite crystallization.98 PeLEDs based on the above strategy exhibited high luminance of 18000 cd m−2 and a CE of 8.74 cd A−1, values which are 4.5 and 2.5 times higher, respectively, than standard PeLEDs.
5. Summary and outlook
In summary, perovskite crystallization processes, coordination in precursor solutions, and recent advances relating to solvent-based strategies for obtaining efficient PeLEDs are discussed in this review. This will help to improve understanding of solvent effects on the nucleation and growth of perovskites.
In addition to a brief review of perovskite materials, the chemical pathways from precursor solution to perovskite formation are described to understand and clarify the entire process. Due to the importance of the interactions between the precursor and molecules in solution, the nucleation and crystal growth of perovskites can be affected via precisely controlling the degree of interaction between the precursor molecules and the solvent to achieve the control of surface morphology. Therefore, apart from the aprotic polar solvents commonly used today, the development of alternative coordination solvents is key for achieving further improved PeLEDs. Then, the influence of solvent additives on the solution properties and crystallization processes was introduced, and the effects of different additives on the crystallization process were illustrated based on examples. Thus, an efficient method to realize high-performance PeLEDs is to study the properties of solvent molecules and select suitable solvent additives that meet different application requirements. Finally, the role of anti-solvents in the solvent dropping method was studied. From a safety point of view, it is desirable to replace toxic chlorobenzene and toluene with more eco-friendly anti-solvent alternatives.
Although some promising results arising from solvent-based strategies have been reported so far, further research is needed. Firstly, the precise structures of colloidal clusters and interphases in perovskite precursors are not clear, so the formation mechanisms of perovskites need to be further studied. Secondly, it is necessary to expand the existing solvent systems and develop more alternative solvents to meet different needs. Finally, no matter which kind of solvent is used, it is necessary to strive for safety and environmental protection while not sacrificing the film performance. It is believed that obtaining a deeper understanding of solvent strategies and expanding them can help to overcome existing problems and improve the performance and stability of devices in the future.
