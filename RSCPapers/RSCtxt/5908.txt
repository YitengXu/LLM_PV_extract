    , Accepted 21st February 2012First published on 6th March 2012AbstractNb2O5 as a new electron transport layer (ETL) was used for double junction polymer solar cells. The Nb2O5 ETL was prepared by spin coating a Nb2O5 sol–gel solution onto the active layer of the optical front subcell. The double junction devices using Nb2O5 ETL exhibit an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.30 V, which is close to the sum of the s of the individual subcells. The current density–voltage (J–V) simulation showed that the double junction device performance using Nb2O5 as ETL could be significantly increased by reducing the series resistance (Rse) and matching the current densities of the individual subcells.
1. Introduction
Organic solar cells have the potential to spawn a new generation of low-cost, solar-powered products on thin and flexible substrates.1–17 However, the current energy conversion efficiency is still low for commercial applications. One promising way to increase the overall solar cell efficiency is to use a multijunction (or called tandem) structure.18–25 A multijunction structure is equivalent to two or more subcells in which the subcells having different absorption spectra, i.e., different energy gaps, are connected in series or parallel.24,25 There are several challenges restricting the development of solution processable polymer multijunction solar cells (PMSCs). The most notable of these are deposition of interfacial (recombination) layers between subcells and proper selection of active layers with complementary absorption spectra in individual subcells.24 The interfacial (recombination) layers are required to be transparent and provide electrical contact between the adjacent subcells with minimal loss in photovoltage.26 They need to be mechanically strong and stable enough to support additional subcells that will be deposited on top of them. The recombination layers typically consist of an electron transport layer (ETL) and a hole transport layer (HTL). These ETL and HTL help electrons and holes coming from their respective subcells to efficiently recombine. A thin layer of metal (e.g. Ag) is sometimes introduced between the ETL and HTL to improve the recombination at the interface.23,27
Metals or metallic nanoclusters have been reported as semitransparent recombination layers by thermal evaporation in PMSCs.28,29 Highly transparent recombination layers made of sputtered ITO as an ETL have also been reported.21 Solution processable recombination layers including both the ETL and HTL are getting increased attention because they are compatible with all-solution-processed fabrication.30,31 One of the challenges in solution processable PMSCs is to deposit multiple active or interfacial layers without dissolving or destroying the layers that have been deposited underneath. Transition metal oxides such as TiOx, ZnO were used as a solution processable ETL and a stable foundation in multijunction cells.23,32 These metal oxide layers have large bandgaps and are very transparent to the visible and near infrared regions, as well as effective candidates to transport electron carriers. Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) and other transition metal oxides such as V2O5 and MoO3 have been used as HTL.23,32,33 Gilot et al. used ZnO as ETL and neutral pH PEDOT:PSS as HTL to fabricate all solution processable PMSCs.23 Kim et al. used TiOx(x≤2) as ETL and highly conductive PEDOT:PSS as HTL, and achieved a cell efficiency of about 6.5%.32 However, the preparation method of TiOx and ZnO is relatively complicated. TiOx sol–gel solution preparation requires long time (∼9 h), several steps, high temperature and an inert atmosphere.32 On the other hand preparation of ZnO nanoparticles needs moderate time and temperature while controlling their size is difficult as they are prone to agglomeration.23
Herein we report Nb2O5 as a new ETL to replace TiOx and ZnO with a much simpler preparation process. The preparation of Nb2O5 only takes half an hour and can be done at room temperature in an air atmosphere. Nb2O5 sol–gel solution was prepared by mixing the niobium ethoxide (Nb(OC2H5)5) precursor with ethanol and acetic acid at room temperature.34 When deposited by spin coating, the Nb2O5 sol–gel solution exhibited a high attachability on the polymer:fullerene active layer. Then the spin coated film got oxidized quickly to form the Nb2O5 ETL. To demonstrate the feasibility of using Nb2O5 as ETL in DJSCs, well-established active layer materials including poly[2-methoxy-5-(3′,7′-dimethyloctyloxy)-p-phenylene vinylene] (MDMO-PPV) as electron donor and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) as electron acceptor were used to fabricate both the optical front and back subcells.23 It is noteworthy to mention that PPVs are not future stable materials for OPV devices;35,36 however, they are useful as active layers to demonstrate the performance of ETL. The double junction solar cells using Nb2O5 ETL exhibited an open-circuit voltage (Voc) that is close to the sum of the s of the individual subcells, demonstrating that Nb2O5 has great potential as ETL for efficient double junction polymer solar cells. The simulation on current density–voltage (J–V) showed that the double junction device performance using Nb2O5 as ETL could be significantly increased by reducing series resistance (Rse) and matching current densities of individual subcells.
2. Experimental section

Fig. 1 shows the device configuration of the double junction solar cells using Nb2O5 as ETL. To fabricate DJSC devices, indium tin oxide (ITO) glass substrates (Delta Technologies Ltd.) with a sheet resistance of 8–12 Ω □−1 were cleaned with soap water, DI water, acetone and isopropanol (99.5%) each for 10 min with sonication, followed by drying with clean nitrogen blast and oxygen plasma treatment for 20 min. Typical PEDOT:PSS (CLEVIOS™ P VP AI 4083) was spin coated at 4000 rpm for 30 s on top of ITO and then dried at 140 °C for 20 min. The active layer of MDMO-PPV and PCBM (1∶4 by weight, 3 mg ml−1 in chlorobenzene) for the optical front subcell was spin coated at 4500 rpm for 60 s. The Nb2O5 sol–gel solution was prepared by mixing 4.5 ml niobium ethoxide (Nb(OC2H5)5) as precursor (99.95%, Aldrich) with 3 ml ethanol (99.5%) and 0.015 ml acetic acid.34 Ethanol, in this case, was used as solvent to prepare the Nb2O5 sol–gel solution because it did not dissolve or damage the front subcell’s active layer that had been deposited underneath. The precursor mixture was then stirred for an hour and kept for one day. The solution was then further diluted in ethanol before spin coating onto the active layer at 3000 rpm for 60 s in air. Then the pH neutral PEDOT:PSS (Orgacon, batch 5541073, pH = 7, 1.2 wt%, Agfa Gevaert NV) was spin coated at 4000 rpm for 60 s as HTL on top of the Nb2O5 layer. Then the MDMO-PPV:PCBM active layer of the optical back subcell was spin coated at 1500 rpm for 60 s. Finally Ca (20 nm) and Al (100 nm) were deposited as the top electrode at 1 × 10−6 mbar.

3. Results and discussion
The transmission spectra (Fig. 2) of Nb2O5 and Nb2O5/PEDOT:PSS were taken using an Agilent 8453 UV-VIs spectrometer. Fig. 2 shows that the Nb2O5 layer (black line) has transmittance of >90% in the visible region. The deposition of PEDOT:PSS on top of the Nb2O5 layer reduced this value slightly, but still exhibited an overall transmittance of about 90%. Thus the recombination layer made of Nb2O5 and PEDOT:PSS is very transparent and suitable as the middle contact for DJSCs.

The topography images (Fig. 3) were taken using an Agilent 5500 Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) with Picoview 1.8 software in tapping mode. The probes used were Tap 300G-Al purchased from Budget Sensor. Fig. 3a shows the AFM topography image of the MDMO-PPV:PCBM active layer of the optical front subcell. The height-variation is 9.9 nm, almost the same as that (10 nm) in a previous report by Hoppe et al.37 The root mean square (rms) roughness is 1.45 nm. Fig. 3b represents the AFM topography image of the Nb2O5 layer as ETL deposited on top of the MDMO-PPV:PCBM active layer. The Nb2O5 ETL film morphology seemed smoother with a smaller rms of 1.04 nm than that (1.45 nm) of the MDMO-PPV:PCBM active layer, suggesting that the Nb2O5 ETL was successfully deposited onto the active layer of the front subcell. The thickness of Nb2O5 ETL was about 25 nm, measured by a Veeco Dektak 150 profilometer. Fig. 3c shows the AFM topography image of the pH neutral PEDOT:PSS HTL deposited on top of the Nb2O5 ETL. The thickness of PEDOT:PSS HTL was approximately 15 nm. The surface rms roughness of the PEDOT:PSS layer was increased to 1.53 nm, which was larger than those of both the MDMO-PPV:PCBM and Nb2O5 layers.

Thicknesses of the front and back single junction cells as well as the double junction cells were estimated by calculation using the Beer–Lambert law. (1) (2) (3) Where I0 and I are the intensity of the incident and transmitted light, respectively. A is the absorbance, α is the absorption coefficient, and d is the film thickness.
The absorption coefficient of the active layer made of MDMO-PPV:PCBM (1∶4) blend is about 6 × 104 cm−1 at the wavelength of 500 nm.38Fig. 4 shows the absorption spectra of the front and back single junction cells, as well as double junction cells. The active layer absorbance of the front and back single junction cells was found to be 0.176 and 0.212 at the wavelength of 500 nm, corresponding to an approximate thickness of 70 nm and 85 nm, respectively, using the above equations. The effective thickness of the total active layer of double junction cells consisting of both the front and back subcells was found to be 161 nm calculated from its absorbance of 0.42 at 500 nm, which is close to the sum (155 nm) of thicknesses of the front and back subcells.

The fabricated solar cells were characterized inside a glove box under the simulated 1.5 AM, 100 mW cm−2 illumination. Fig. 5 represents the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the optical front and back single junction cells, and the double junction solar cells. The device photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. The Voc (1.3 V) of the overall DJSC is substantially higher than that of individual subcells, close to but less than the sum (1.63 V) of those of the subcells. The significantly increased Voc compared to the individual subcells indicated that Nb2O5 could be used as the ETL in the middle contact layer for DJSCs. However, the double junction cell’s short circuit current density (Jsc) was much lower than those of the individual single junction cells. Also, the series resistance (Rse, 212.6 Ω cm2) of the double junction cell was significantly increased compared to those of the front and back single junction cells. The lower Jsc and larger Rse may be attributed to two reasons: (1) current mismatch between the front and back subcells and/or (2) an interfacial layer barrier that prevents the electron–hole recombination at the middle contact. Although the thicknesses of front and back single junction cells were kept similar to generate comparable Jsc (3.46 mA cm−2 for front and 3.7 mA cm−2 for back), when connected to form a double junction cell, the back subcell may generate much larger Jsc than the front subcell due to the reflection of unabsorbed light by Al to the back subcell for reabsorption in the double junction device configuration.24,39 The overall absorbance of the double junction cell active layer is about 0.42, corresponding to a transmission of 38% at the wavelength of 500 nm. The mirror effect of Al may reflect the 38% transmitted light at the wavelength of 500 nm back to the device for reabsorption. The absorbance of the back subcell is 0.212 at 500 nm wavelength, corresponding to ∼40% absorption; therefore the 38% transmitted light (if all reflected back by the Al electrode) will be reabsorbed only by the back subcell but not the front subcell. Thus this will generate a larger Jsc in the back subcell and leading to current mismatch between the front and back subcells. The current mismatch could cause the pile-up of extra holes from the back subcells and the build-up of a local potential/electric field that could increase the Rse of the overall DJSC, consistent with the large Rse (212.6 Ω cm2) found in the DJSCs. The values for Rse and Rsh were obtained by fitting the J–V curves using IVFIT program. In addition, any interfacial layer barrier that obstructs electron transfer from PCBM to Nb2O5 and hole transfer from MDMO-PPV to PEDOT:PSS can also reduce Jsc and increase the Rse in the double junction cells. Due to the increased Rse, fill factor (FF) was also reduced.23,29 However, it is interesting to notice that Rsh of the DJSC was increased to a higher value compared with those of the front and back single junction cells. One possible reason for the larger Rsh is that direct shunt between the two electrodes might be reduced compared to the individual front and back single junction cells as two subcells are stacked together by interfacial layers. We simulated the DJSC J–V curve by taking an average of Rse and Rsh, and a lower Jsc from the individual subcells. Although Rsh decreased compared to experimental value, Voc and η were significantly increased as Rse was reduced from 212.6 Ω cm2 to 8.05 Ω cm2. Work is underway to further match the current from individual subcells and to study the interfacial layer barrier.

4. Conclusion
In summary, we report Nb2O5 as a new electron transport layer (ETL) for double junction polymer solar cells. The Nb2O5 ETL was prepared by spin coating a Nb2O5 sol–gel solution onto the active layer of the optical front subcell. The double junction solar cells exhibited an open-circuit voltage (Voc) that is close to the sum of the s of the individual subcells, demonstrating that Nb2O5 has great potential as ETL for efficient double junction polymer solar cells. As reported by others,23,40,41 although the efficiencies of overall double or triple junction cells were lower than those of single junction cells when the same polymer was used in the individual subcells, their significantly increased Voc was a good indicator to show that a ZnO interfacial layer could be used to fabricate double or triple junction solar cells. Since our objective here is to demonstrate the feasibility of using Nb2O5 as a new interfacial layer with much simpler preparation processes in double junction polymer solar cells, the high overall efficiency is not our target. Therefore even though it is lower than that of single junction cells, it should not affect such demonstration since the Voc of double junction cells was significantly increased as close to the sum of the s of the individual subcells. The current density–voltage (J–V) simulation showed that the double junction device performance using Nb2O5 as ETL could be significantly increased by reducing the series resistance (Rse) and matching the current densities of the individual subcells.
