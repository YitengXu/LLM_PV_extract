    , Accepted 5th October 2021First published on 6th October 2021AbstractPhotomemories offer great opportunities for multifunctional integration of optical sensing, data storage, and processing into one single device. However, little attention has been paid to photomemories working in the solar-blind region so far, which may have unique advantages of insusceptibility to ambient light and higher capacity. Herein, we propose and demonstrate a Ga2O3 based solar-blind photomemory array with logic, arithmetic, and optoelectronic memory functions. The device shows n-type field effect-transistor performance with an on/off ratio as high as 106, a responsivity of 8 × 103 A W−1, and a detectivity of 1.42 × 1014 Jones, all of which are amongst the best values ever reported for Ga2O3 based photodetectors. Based on the trapping and de-trapping process of holes in Ga2O3, multilevel data storage can be realized from the device. Simultaneously, the optical and electrical mixed basic logic of reconfigurable “AND” and “OR” operations have been realized in a single cell through the co-regulation of solar-blind light and the grid voltage. In addition, the photomemory can perform counting and addition operations, and the photomemory array can be utilized to realize solar-blind image storage. The results suggest that Ga2O3 may have potential applications in high-performance information storage, computing, and communications.

New concepts
An alternative strategy of “More-than-Moore” is to develop devices with diversified functions. An important module of diversified function optoelectronic integrated systems is photomemories. Up to now, photomemories using visible and infrared light as the stimuli have been widely studied. On the other hand, photomemories using solar-blind light as the excitation may have unique advantages of insusceptibility to ambient light and higher capacity, which will become an important field of research and market driving. However, no report on photomemories operating in the solar-blind region can be found to date. Ga2O3 is an ideal choice to develop solar-blind photomemories due to its intrinsic solar-blind properties and strong self-trapped holes effect. In this work, we report a multilevel solar-blind photomemory array based on Ga2O3 with logic, arithmetic, and image storage functions. The storage and erasing processes are realized by the trapping and de-trapping of the photo-generated holes, leading to multilevel nonvolatile storage characteristics. Simultaneously, the optical and electrical mixed basic logic of reconfigurable “AND” and “OR” operations have been realized through the co-regulation of solar-blind light and the VGS. In addition, the photomemory can perform counting and addition operations, and the photomemory array can be utilized to realize solar-blind image storage.

Introduction
As chip processing technology approaches the scaling limits, further reducing the size of transistors in microprocessors will soon be economically undesirable.1–4 An alternative strategy of “More-than-Moore” is to develop devices with diversified functions, which has been highlighted in the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS) 2.0.5–9 Multifunctional integration of optical sensors, data storage, processing, and even computing is one of the main approaches to simplify the optoelectronic system.10–13 An important module of such optoelectronic integrated systems is photomemories, the major task of which is to write and store the electrical bits of information through optical means.14–16 Compared with traditional electrically operated memory, photomemories can be used to store light information with an electronic readout at low programming voltages and are beneficial for the storage and transport of secured information.17–19 Using optical and electrical stimuli as input signals has the potential for enlarging the ratio of low resistance state and high resistance state, thus enabling multilevel data storage and improving data storage capacity.20,21 From another aspect, an optical trigger is employed in photomemories for the switching, bringing the benefits of wide bandwidth and reduction of electrical loss during sensory data transmission.22,23 In addition, it is promising to perform digital processing functions with light as an extra control parameter by combining both optical and electrical input signals, such as arithmetic and logic operations and optical imaging.24–26 Up to now, photomemories using visible and infrared light as the stimuli have been widely studied based on silicon, organic molecules, perovskite, graphene, and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs).27–30 On the other hand, photomemories using solar-blind light as the excitation may have unique advantages of insusceptibility to ambient light and higher capacity, which will become an important field of research and market driving. However, no report on photomemories operating in the solar-blind region can be found to date.
Gallium oxide (Ga2O3) is an ideal choice to develop solar-blind photomemories due to its intrinsic solar-blind properties.31–33 Ga2O3 solar-blind photodetectors have exhibited excellent sensitivity, high responsivity, large on/off ratios, and high working temperatures.34–36 Besides, Ga2O3 shows a strong self-trapped holes effect, which is usually regarded as a shortage for Ga2O3 photodetectors because it leads to slow recovery speeds.37–41 However, in the case of data storage, the working mechanism of photomemories is based on charging trapping centers, which can be used to store photo-generated carriers after removing the optical stimuli. Thus, the intrinsic hole trapping effect in Ga2O3 is intrinsically suitable for the realization of such solar-blind photomemories. Compared with the massive amount of research on Ga2O3-based solar-blind photodetectors, photomemories fabricated from Ga2O3 have not been investigated.
In addition to data storage capacity, solar-blind photomemories with more functions are highly demanded for information recording and processing. Traditional information processing and storage devices require complex routing matrices and thousands of integrated components to implement a single function, which have unpredictable signal transmission delays and large volumes.42 By integrating optical and electrical methods, such as employing light and voltage as the input, and electric current as the output, a simple-structured photomemory with logic, arithmetic, and image capturing functions can be realized. In this concept, information storage and processing can be done at the same time, which can reduce the data transmission latency, lowering the circuit complexity and power consumption of the integrated circuit.5,20
In this work, we report a multilevel solar-blind photomemory array based on Ga2O3 with logic, arithmetic, and image storage functions. The photomemory array is composed of a charge trapping layer (monoclinic Ga2O3, β-Ga2O3), a barrier layer (Al2O3), and a channel layer (amouphous GaOx, a-GaOx), which is similar to a field effect-transistor (FET), except that a hole trapping layer is inserted between the gate and the dielectric layer to provide the storage function. The device exhibits typical gate control effects and photoelectric effects, including a typical transistor output and transfer characteristics with an on/off ratio of 106, a responsivity of 8 × 103 A W−1, a detectivity of 1.42 × 1014 Jones, and an EQE of 3.9 × 106%, all of which are amongst the best values ever reported for Ga2O3 based photodetectors. The storage and erasing processes are realized by the trapping and de-trapping of the photo-generated holes at the β-Ga2O3/Al2O3 interface, leading to multilevel nonvolatile storage characteristics. Moreover, the coupling of optical and electrical modulation ensures the logic operation of reconfigurable “OR” and “AND” gates by utilizing deep ultraviolet (DUV) light and the grid voltage (VGS) as inputs, and the channel current as the output. The stepwise and linear relationship between the device output current and the number of input light pulses makes the device capable of performing counting and addition operations. Solar-blind image capturing and storage functions have also been demonstrated using the photomemory array.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1a shows the schematic structure and photograph of the 4 × 4 Ga2O3 solar-blind photomemory array. The photomemory array contains an a-GaOx channel layer, an Al2O3 dielectric layer, and a β-Ga2O3 charge-trapping layer. For an enhancement-mode FET, the conductivity of the channel layer should be improved. In previous work, we have demonstrated a bandgap and conductivity engineering method of Ga2O3 by modulating the crystalline disorder in the film via adjusting the oxygen flow rate.43Fig. 1b shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of Ga2O3 grown at high (20 sccm) and low (3 sccm) oxygen flow rates. From the XRD results, it is apparent that the oxygen-deficient Ga2O3 grown at a low oxygen flow rate is amorphous. While the XRD spectrum of the β-Ga2O3 films shows three diffraction peaks located at 18.91°, 38.41°, and 59.21°, which can be attributed to the diffraction from the (01), (02), and (03) facets of β-Ga2O3, respectively.44,45Fig. 1c and d present the absorption spectra and resistance of the β-Ga2O3 and a-GaOx films, respectively. The a-GaOx has a bandgap of 4.0 eV, which is narrower than that of β-Ga2O3 (5.2 eV). Moreover, the resistance of a-GaOx is about 4 orders of magnitude lower than that of β-Ga2O3, as shown in Fig. 1d. Compared with β-Ga2O3, a-GaOx shows a narrower bandgap and lower resistance due to the increased crystalline disorder (Fig. S1 in the ESI†) and oxygen vacancy density (Fig. S2 in the ESI†). Thus, the relatively low-resistance a-GaOx is utilized as the channel layer for the photomemory array, and β-Ga2O3, which provides stable trapping sites for photo-generated holes, is inserted between the insulator and the metal gate to enhance the storage performance of the photomemory array (see Fig. S3 in the ESI†).

Fig. 1e presents the drain current and gate voltage (IDS–VGS) transfer curve of a typical photomemory cell in the dark, from which the apparent field-effect control ability of the gate voltage over the channel current can be observed. The IDS can be turned off when the gate is biased negatively with an on/off ratio of about 106; the high on/off ratio enables multilevel storage improving data storage capacity. Fig. 1f shows the typical complete storage and erase curve for the photomemory cell, which can be divided into three processes, including an optical writing process, a storage state after optical to electrical conversion, and an electrical erasing process under a negative VGS. Correspondingly, Fig. 1g shows the energy-band structures for these three processes. During the optical writing process (VDS = 5 V, VGS = 15 V, and UV illumination is ON), electron–hole pairs are generated by photons in both the β-Ga2O3 and a-GaOx films. The photo-generated carriers aggregated in the a-GaOx film improve the photoconductivity between the source and drain, leading to increasing of the IDS. While in the β-Ga2O3 film, the photo-generated electrons will flow to the gate electrode, and the photo-generated holes will be driven towards the β-Ga2O3/Al2O3 interface by the VGS and transform into self-trapped holes (STHs), forming a positive local gate voltage.38,46–48 Due to the long lifetime of the STHs, the positive local gate could be retained after turning off the DUV illumination, keeping the channel layer in the low resistance state, which is the storage process. Then the IDS decays gradually as the STHs recombine with electrons. For the erasing process, a large negative VGS is applied to drive the STHs to the gate electrode and eliminate the local gate voltage, resetting the channel layer to the original high-resistance state.5,19

Fig. 2a shows the output curves of the photomemory cell with the VGS ranging from 45 to −30 V. It reveals typical transistor characteristics with the IDS increasing linearly with the VDS at low VDS and becoming saturated at high VDS. The normalized response spectrum of the photomemory cell is shown in Fig. 2b, and a maximum responsivity at 240 nm is visible with a shoulder that can be observed at around 330 nm, which corresponds to the bandgap of β-Ga2O3 and a-GaOx. Fig. 2c presents the IDS–VGS transfer curves of the photomemory cell under 254 nm illumination, which shows that the IDS in the depletion region increases by about 6 orders of magnitude compared with the values in dark (Fig. 1e). Fig. 2d and e provide the dependence of photocurrent and responsivity on the light intensity and VGS. It can be seen that the photocurrent increases with the light intensity and VGS. Fig. 2e shows that the responsivity is as large as 8 × 103 A W−1 at VDS = 20 V and VGS = 30 V when the incident light intensity is 0.1 mW cm−2 and decreases gradually as the incident light intensity increases. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) can be determined using the following formula:49 (1)where Rλ is the responsivity, h is Planck's constant, c is the light velocity, q is the elementary charge, and λ is the incident light wavelength. The EQE of the photomemory cell at a 254 nm illumination intensity of 0.1 mW cm−2 as a function of the VGS is plotted in Fig. 2f. The EQE increases with VGS and reaches 3.9 × 106% when the VGS is 30 V. Another important factor for an optoelectronic device is detectivity (D*), which can be described using the following equation:50 (2)where Jd is the dark current density. D* increases with VGS and reaches as high as 1.42 × 1014 Jones (1 Jones = 1 cm Hz1/2 W−1) when VGS = 30 V (Fig. 2f).

As discussed above, the output of the photomemory can be modulated by both the VGS and 254 nm light illumination, which is a determining factor for multilevel optoelectronic storage and electrical erasability. In order to verify the optoelectronic storage capability of this photomemory array, the current–voltage (I–V) curves in different three states were studied, as shown in Fig. 3a, in which curves 1, 2, and 3 present the current in the dark, under a 254 nm illumination with an intensity of 1.2 mW cm−2, and 5 minutes after turning off the light, respectively. One can see that the current after turning off the light is still an order of magnitude larger than the initial level, suggesting the optoelectronic storage function of the device. The IDS–VGS curve for the storage state can be utilized to judge whether the photomemory is electrically erasable. As shown in Fig. 3b, the VGS also has an obvious regulating effect on the IDS with an on/off ratio of about 104 and a threshold voltage (Vth) of about −30 V. Therefore, a sufficient negative VGS can be used to realize the electrical erasing process. As the resistance of the channel is changed continuously under illumination, it is expected that the photomemory may possess multilevel storage properties. In order to study the multilevel storage function of this device, we investigated the optoelectronic storage under different light intensities, different pulse numbers, and different exposure times. Fig. 3c demonstrates the dependence of the photocurrent and readout current on the intensity of illumination (254 nm with a pulse width of 30 s), which reveals that the readout current increases with the light intensity. Both the spike current and the relaxation current (the current after turning off the solar-blind light for 100 s) increase linearly with the incident power intensity (Fig. S4 in the ESI†), indicating the possibility for multilevel storage under different light intensities. In order to study the multilevel storage function under different light pulse numbers, each optical state is written into the photomemory by changing the pulse numbers (pulse width = 10 s, pulse interval = 10 s, intensity = 0.2 mW cm−2), as shown in the Fig. 3d. The magnitude of the spike current and relaxation current increase linearly with the light pulse number, as shown in Fig. 3e. The increments of the spike current and relaxation current are around 3.72 μA and 1.73 μA per light pulse, respectively, providing the possibility for multilevel storage under different pulse numbers. In addition, similar results for multilevel storage can also be obtained by changing the exposure time of a single light pulse with fixed light intensity (see Fig. S5 in the ESI†). Fig. 3f shows multiple cycles of optical writing (the 254 nm light intensity is 0.5 mW cm−2, and the pulse width is 20 s) and electrical erasing (VGS = −40 V and application time is 20 s) of the multi-level photomemory, indicating good reproducibility and stability. More importantly, the storage state remains distinguishable for one hour upon removing the illumination source (see Fig. S6 in the ESI†), therefore the electrical information written by the optical means is non-volatile.

(f) Periodic optical writing (0.5 mW cm−2) and electrical erasing (VGS = −40 V) process of the photomemory cell. 
Optoelectronic memory with logical function is a determining factor in simplifying data processing, storage, and artificial intelligence. For this photomemory-type logic device, DUV illumination and VGS form an optical input (Opt.in) and electronic input (Ele.in) to control the output current signals (Iout), respectively. Fig. 4a shows the schematic operation principle of the logic cell. For the logic of “OR”, the drain current should be enhanced by the solar-blind light and VGS separately. The logical 0 and 1 of the optical inputs represent the “off” and “on” states of the 254 nm illumination (0.1 mW cm−2), respectively. VGS values of 0 and 30 V are chosen as the logical 0 and 1 of the electrical inputs respectively, because the drain current at VGS = 30 V is larger than that at 1 μA even without illumination. For the logical function of “AND”, the drain current can be enhanced only when the optical and electronic inputs are 1 simultaneously. Thus the logical 0 and 1 of the electrical inputs represent the VGS of −30 and 0 V respectively, because a VGS of −30 V can suppress the drain current under illumination. For both the “AND” and “OR” logical functions, the logical output is defined as 0/1 when the final output current at VDS = 10 V is smaller/larger than 1.0 μA, as presented in Fig. 4b. The truth table of the logic operation (Fig. 4c) has two columns of output values, which are consistent with the bistable logic operations of the “OR” and “AND” gates. The working state controlled by the VGS allows the present device to work as a reconfigurable logic element that can switch between different algorithms, reducing the circuit complexity and increasing the effective integrating density of the processor chip.

The multilevel storage characteristics of the photomemory lay a solid foundation for arithmetic and multilevel imaging functions. Before investigating the arithmetic function of the photomemory, the paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) effect should be studied, which is defined as the ratio of C2/C1, where C1 and C2 are the spike current of the device for the first and second pulse, respectively, as highlighted in the inset of Fig. 5a. When a light pulse is applied to the phototransistor, the current in the a-GaOx film channel increases, and the photogenerated holes are trapped near the barrier layer, leading to a long decay time. Thus, the current is still larger than the initial level when the second light pulse is applied to the photomemory cell, resulting in a higher spike current than that for the first light pulse. Fig. 5a shows the dependence of PPF on the interval time. The PPF index decreases gradually from 180% to 108% when the pulse interval increases from 5 s to 30 s (pulse width of 10 s). Based on the PPF phenomenon, the relationship between the photocurrent and light pulse number can be utilized to realize computing functions. When multiple identical light pulses (light intensity = 0.1 mW cm−2, pulse width = 10 s, pulse interval = 15 s, read voltage VDS = 5 V and VGS = 15 V) are applied to the device in sequence, the output current increases from 5.6 to 34.6 μA linearly, in response to the input light pulse number from 1 to 15, as shown in Fig. 5b. The observed linear relationship between the output current and the number of input light pulses can be expressed as: Iout = A × n + B then n = (Iout − B)/A, where Iout is the output current (μA) of the device, n ≠ 0 is the number of light pulse inputs, A is the photocurrent ramping step of 2.06 ± 0.025 (μA) per light illumination, and B ∼ 2.97 ± 0.23 (μA) is a constant. As such, the present Opt.in and Ele.out of the device is capable of operating as an arithmetic element for basic counting and adding operations. For instance, with a readout current of 30 μA for the optoelectronic arithmetic element, the total number of light pulses applied onto the device, 13 in this case, can be counted accordingly (upper panel of Fig. 5c). Similarly, when a bundle of 6 light pulses and a bundle of 9 light pulses are applied onto the arithmetic element sequentially, an output current of 34.2 μA, which equals the photocurrent of a bundle of 15 light pulses, can be read from the optoelectronic device. Therefore, a simple adding operation of 6 + 9 = 15 can be completed with the photomemory cell (lower panel of Fig. 5c). Nevertheless, the arithmetic operation is non-volatile and can be erased by a negative VGS, which makes the computing and memory functions achievable in a single device, thus allowing the design of scalable and complex computation architectures.

(b) The relationship between the output current of the device and the number of input light pulse. The light intensity is 0.1 mW cm−2, the pulse width is 10 s, the pulse interval is 15 s, the read voltage VDS is 5 V, and VGS is 15 V. (c) Schematic illustration of the counting and adding operations performed by this device. (d) Schematic illustration of multilevel image storage for the photomemory array. Multilevel image storage results under different light intensities (e) and different pulse numbers (f). 
The application of the photomemory array in multilevel image storage is also investigated. The performance uniformity of photomemory cells is crucial for the image storage of arrays. Fig. S7 (ESI†) shows the statistic values for the dark current, spike current (the light intensity is 0.2 mW cm−2, and pulse width is 10 s), and relaxation current of the 16 cells at VDS = 5 V and VGS = 15 V. The current values of all three states show good uniformity and can be clearly distinguished, indicating the good uniformity of the array. Fig. 5d shows the experiment setup of the multilevel image storage. A photomask with two “L” is placed between the photomemory array and the solar-blind light source, two kinds of light carrying different information (intensity, number of pulses, and exposure times) pass through the photomask simultaneously, producing an optical pattern with bright and dark contrast on the photomemory array. The measured results of multilevel image storage under two light beams with different intensities (1.2 mW cm−2 and 0.5 mW cm−2) are shown in Fig. 5e. Two clear letters “L” with different brightness can be identified, indicating the fine imaging performance of the photomemory array. After turning off the light for 5 minutes, the outputs of the array also obviously show two letters “L” with different brightness, indicating that the photomemory array has the function of multilevel image storage under different light intensities. By applying a negative VGS (−40 V) to erase the photomemory array, all outputs return to the original values. In addition, Fig. 5f shows the results of multilevel image storage under different light pulse numbers (1 pulse and 5 pulses). It is apparent that the write results and the storage data after 5 minutes of storage of different pulse numbers can be distinguished. Multilevel image storage can also be achieved using two light pulses with different exposure times (see Fig. S8 in the ESI†). Although it still remains a challenging task for the solar-blind photomemory array to exhibit permanent optical storage, the above results suggest its potential for optoelectronic multilevel modulation.
Conclusion
To summarize, by combining the co-regulation of solar-blind light and VGS with hole-trapping effects in the Ga2O3 phototransistor, a multilevel solar-blind photomemory array has been proposed and demonstrated. The device shows both transfer characteristics and solar-blind response behaviors. The optical and electrical mixed basic logic of reconfigurable “AND” and “OR” operations can be achieved using the Ga2O3 photomemory array. Besides, the Ga2O3 photomemory array shows multilevel data storage and processing, such as counting and addition. Based on the multilevel storage properties, we have also demonstrated that the Ga2O3 photomemory array can be utilized to realize a solar-blind image storage function. All the above applications have not been explored using Ga2O3-based materials. The present finding demonstrates the possibility of using Ga2O3 as multifunctional solar-blind optoelectronic devices for future high-performance information storage, computing, and communication applications.
Experimental section
Fabrication of the phototransistor array
The Ga2O3 films were grown using a plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) technique. Oxygen (O2) and triethylgallium (TEGa) were employed as the precursors for the growth; high-purity (9N) nitrogen (N2) was used as the carrier gas to lead the precursors into the growth chamber. During the deposition process, the substrate temperature was kept at 550 °C and the pressure in the PECVD chamber was set at 0.7 Torr, and the N2 flow rates were maintained at 15 sccm. The flow rates of O2 for β-Ga2O3 and a-GaOx were 20 and 3 sccm, and the thicknesses were 20 nm and 100 nm, respectively. The Al2O3 film (20 nm) was deposited using atomic layer deposition (ALD) at 200 °C. The metallic Ti/Au layer was deposited as the contact using a thermal evaporation method.
Characterization and measurements
The absorption spectra of the β-Ga2O3 and a-GaOx films were recorded using a spectrophotometer (Hitachi, UH4150). The composition of the materials was recorded using X-ray photoelectron energy spectroscopy using a Thermol Scientific Escalab 250Xi with Al Kα radiation. The structural properties of the β-Ga2O3 and a-GaOx films were evaluated using XRD with a Cu Kα line (1.54 Å) as the radiation source (Rigaku, SmartLab). High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) was recorded in a JEOL JEM-2100F field emission microscope. The electrical characteristics of the phototransistors were measured using a semiconductor parameter analyzer (Keithley, 4200-SCS). The spectral response of the phototransistor was measured using a photoresponse testing system including a 150 W UV-enhanced Xe lamp, a monochromator, a chopper, and a lock-in amplifier. All the characterizations were performed at room temperature in the air.

New concepts
An alternative strategy of “More-than-Moore” is to develop devices with diversified functions. An important module of diversified function optoelectronic integrated systems is photomemories. Up to now, photomemories using visible and infrared light as the stimuli have been widely studied. On the other hand, photomemories using solar-blind light as the excitation may have unique advantages of insusceptibility to ambient light and higher capacity, which will become an important field of research and market driving. However, no report on photomemories operating in the solar-blind region can be found to date. Ga2O3 is an ideal choice to develop solar-blind photomemories due to its intrinsic solar-blind properties and strong self-trapped holes effect. In this work, we report a multilevel solar-blind photomemory array based on Ga2O3 with logic, arithmetic, and image storage functions. The storage and erasing processes are realized by the trapping and de-trapping of the photo-generated holes, leading to multilevel nonvolatile storage characteristics. Simultaneously, the optical and electrical mixed basic logic of reconfigurable “AND” and “OR” operations have been realized through the co-regulation of solar-blind light and the VGS. In addition, the photomemory can perform counting and addition operations, and the photomemory array can be utilized to realize solar-blind image storage.
