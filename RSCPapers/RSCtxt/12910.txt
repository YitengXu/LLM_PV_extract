    , Accepted 5th October 2016First published on 5th October 2016Abstractvan der Waals (vdWs) heterostructures, obtained by vertically stacking two-dimensional layered materials upon each other, appear particularly promising for future atomically thin electronic and optoelectronic devices and attract a great deal of attention due to their diverse functionalities. Chemical routes to construct vdWs heterostructures offer the prospect of both high yield and uniformity which is the foundation for their application in the semiconductor industry in the future. Here we demonstrate the growth of two-dimensional SnSe2/MoS2 heterostructures with a large lattice misfit via a two-step chemical vapor deposition method. The bottom MoS2 monolayers can be partially or fully covered with single-crystalline SnSe2 monolayers by controlling the growth conditions. The as-grown heterostructures are characterized by using optical microscopy, atomic force microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, Raman and photoluminescence spectroscopies. The results indicate that the heterostructures display the vdWs epitaxial feature, that is, the vertically stacked SnSe2/MoS2 heterostructures with well-aligned lattice orientation. The interlayer coupling interaction and charge separation are also observed in the heterostructures by Raman and photoluminescence spectroscopies. We believe that our results could be helpful for understanding the fundamental physics of atomically thin vdWs heterostructures, and such heterostructures may have potential applications in novel electronics and optoelectronics.
1. Introduction
Two-dimensional (2D) layered materials, unlike traditional three-dimensional (3D) materials, consist of weakly stacked single atomically thin layers that are one-unit cell in thickness.1 The representative materials of those classes include graphene,2 hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN),3 transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) (e.g. MoS2, WS2, MoSe2, WSe2),4 IIIA–VIA group (GaS, GaSe, GaTe, InSe, In2Se3)5–10 and IVA–VIA semiconductors (e.g. SnS2, SnSe2).11 Recently, they have attracted considerable attention due to their layer-number-dependent physical properties and potential applications in electronic and optoelectronic devices.12–16 Exploring the full potential of these 2D crystals requires precise tuning of their composition and structure to create well-defined heterostructures.17 A successful example of the 2D heterostructures to date is so-called van der Waals (vdWs) heterostructures, in which mono- or multi-layers of multiple 2D-materials are stacked vertically layer-by-layer.18–20 Unlike the traditional semiconductor heterostructures that require lattice match to ensure high-quality interfaces, vdWs heterostructures have high-quality interfaces with atomically sharp layers and the junction region can be as thin as two atomic layers.21 Since they are ultrathin and unlimited by lattice matching, the vdWs heterostructures provide a good platform for exploring new physics and novel applications that could trigger a new revolution in the architecture design of heterostructures for integrated electronic and optoelectronic devices.22–25 For example, the vdWs heterostructures of graphene and h-BN, MoS2 or WS2 allow the observation of a superlattice Dirac point and a Hofstadter butterfly effect,26,27 and permit the operation of tunneling transistors.28 In addition, a sandwich structure with a multilayer 2D-semiconductor such as WSe2 between two graphene sheets serving as charge extraction contacts could ally the high photodetection efficiency of the layered semiconductor with a picosecond photoresponse comparable to that of graphene.29 Although the graphene/semiconductor vertical heterostructures are expected to play a crucial role in high speed electronic devices because of the ultra-high mobility of graphene, the absence of a band-gap in graphene prevents its application in some optoelectronic devices.30 As alternatives, many 2D-semiconductors with sizable band-gap between 1.0 and 3.0 eV have emerged to complement the shortcomings of graphene and have shown advantageous optoelectronic properties.31 Indeed, the vdWs heterostructures of all 2D-semiconductors are particularly exciting building blocks for advanced optoelectronics owing to their strong light–matter interaction.14,25,32 This is because most of the 2D-semiconductor monolayers possess a direct band-gap and ultrahigh specific surface area.21 Furthermore, the 2D-semiconductor vdWs heterostructures are predicted to form type II band alignment, which can improve the separation efficiency of the photo-excited carriers.18
Up to now, several vdWs heterostructures made from TMDs, such as WS2/MoS2,25,33–36 WSe2/MoS2,37,38 MoSe2/WSe2,32 MoSe2/MoS2,39,40 and MoS2/MoTe2,41 have been fabricated as field-effect transistors (FETs), solar cells, photodetectors and novel optoelectronics. The optical and electrical properties of those devices could be strongly modulated due to the effective charge transfer and band structure reconstruction, which originated from interlayer coupling.32,36,41–43 Most of those heterostructures form commensurate superlattices because of their similar lattice structures and constants. Incommensurate superstructures consisting of misfit layers are also interesting because the unique structures may lead to many extraordinary functions.44 In addition, the vdWs heterostructures assembled by the TMDs generally have a stable 2H type structure but a less stable 1T structural phase.45 However, it is worth noting that the 2D-semiconductors with the 1T phase exhibit several advantages due to their metallic nature.46 Therefore, the vdWs heterostructures made from 2H and 1T phase semiconductors are expected to have some special properties. For example, the tunneling FET based on multilayer 2H phase WSe2 and 1T phase SnSe2 have been reported to exhibit an excellent on/off ratio (107) and a clear signature of band-to-band tunneling at the heterostructure.47
SnSe2 is an important 2D semiconductor with the 1T phase.48 As an n-type semiconductor, SnSe2 possesses a high electron affinity (∼5.2 eV), which facilitates the realization of Ohmic contacts in device fabrication.49 Recently, mechanically exfoliated bilayer SnSe2 has been shown to have a mobility of 4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and an on/off ratio of ∼103.45 More interestingly, multilayer SnSe2 sheets synthesized by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) have been demonstrated to have a high responsivity of 1.1 × 103 A W−1 and a fast response (14.5 ms).50 The layered configuration, appropriate electronic structure, and inherent semiconducting characteristics make SnSe2 a good candidate for electronic and optoelectronic devices.50 On the other hand, as a representative TMD, MoS2 has been one of the most extensively studied materials in 2D-crystals beyond graphene because of its excellent characteristics (i.e. a direct band-gap of ∼1.85 eV, n-type behavior, high electron mobility and photo-responsiveness in the monolayer).14 Therefore, the vdWs heterostructure of SnSe2/MoS2 could be expected to have particular characteristics and potential applications in electronics and optoelectronics.
Mechanical exfoliation and the dry-transfer process with the aid of the optical microscope and micromanipulators are widely utilized for manufacturing vdWs heterostructures.25,37,38,41,51 However, it is difficult to precisely control the stacking orientation and prevent the contamination at the interfaces of the heterostructures.35,36 The mechanical method is also limited in size, reproducibility, and low throughput.44 In addition, the hydrothermal method is also widely applied to grow TMD nanosheets and TMD/graphene composites mainly for potential applications in energy conversion and storage52,53 rather than atomically thin electronic devices (e.g. FET) because of their incompatibility in the traditional silicon process. Generally, the 2D crystals and their heterostructures grown on substrates (e.g. SiO2/Si) by the CVD process demonstrate large-area, high-quality and a specific 2D feature, which can facilitate the fabrication of high-performance electronic devices. Recently, the CVD method has been developed to fabricate the vdWs heterostructures such as WS2/MoS233 and GaSe/MoSe2.44 By alternating precursor vapors and adjusting the growth conditions, WS2 can nucleate and grow on the top of a pre-grown MoS2 monolayer to form stacked double monolayers.33 Besides, multilayered MoS2, WS2 and WSe2 could also grow uniformly onto SnS2 plates with micro thickness via a CVD process.54 Based on our knowledge, there is no report on the synthesis of SnSe2 monolayers and vdWs heterostructures between ultra-thin IVA–VIA compounds and TMDs.
Herein we report the vdWs epitaxial growth of SnSe2 on the MoS2 monolayer to create atomically thin heterostructures with a clean interface and strong interlayer coupling via a two-step CVD method. Monolayer or a few layered SnSe2 on MoS2 can be formed by controlling the CVD conditions. The as-grown heterostructures have been found to exhibit clear misfit lattice matching. Spatial Raman spectroscopy and imaging show that the E2g and A1g modes of MoS2 exhibit a clear softening, and display a slight red-shift, respectively. The spatially resolved photoluminescence (PL) demonstrates that the as-grown heterostructures exhibit effective interlayer charge transfer due to the interlayer coupling in the heterostacked region. The CVD method to directly produce vdWs heterostructures between IVA–VIA compounds and TMDs presented in this work is expected to render fundamental investigations of these systems more accessible to the scientific community, and could be helpful for both understanding the fundamental physics of atomically thin vdWs heterostructures and fabricating high performance electronics and optoelectronics in the future.
2. Experimental procedure
The MoS2 triangular sheets were grown on SiO2 (285 nm)/p+ Si substrates via a CVD method in a dual temperature zone system with a 1 inch quartz tube, using S (99.99%, Alfa Aesar) and MoO3 (99.99%, Alfa Aesar) as sources, and high-purity argon as carrier gas, as illustrated in Fig. S1a (ESI†). The MoO3 powders were loaded in a graphite crucible, and the substrates were faced down and placed on the upper side of MoO3 powder. The S sources were loaded in a quartz boat and preplaced outside of the furnace and rapidly loaded from outside into the upstream zone for starting the growth. These two zones were heated to 150 °C (for sulfur) and 680 °C (for MoO3) at a ramping rate of 40 °C min−1, and the growth lasted for 3 min prior to cooling under the argon flow (50 sccm). Growth of ultrathin SnSe2 flakes on MoS2 was accomplished via another CVD technique in a hot-wall furnace using Se and SnI2 as precursors, as shown in Fig. S1b (ESI†). The Se powder of 50 mg and SnI2 powder of 8 mg were separately loaded in a quartz boat and placed at the upstream, and the as-grown MoS2 layers were placed at the downstream 14–15 cm away from the center zone. Prior to the growth, the system was cleaned using argon for 30 min. The furnace was then heated to 620 °C in 10 min. During the growth process, a mixture of argon (50 sccm) and H2 (10 sccm) flows was used as carrying gas. A typical growth kept for 2 min. It was worth noting that the growth of both monolayer MoS2 triangular and ultrathin SnSe2/MoS2 heterostructures was achieved at atmospheric pressure.
The as-grown samples were characterized using an optical microscope (OM, Leica DM4000M), a scanning electron microscope (SEM, FEI Nova NanoSEM 200), a confocal Raman/PL system (invia, Renishaw), an atomic force microscope (AFM, Nanoscope IIIa, Vecoo), and a transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEOL 2100F) equipped with an X-ray energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS, Bruker Quantax). The as-synthesized SnSe2/MoS2 heterostructures were transferred from SiO2/Si substrates to carbon-coated copper grids with the assistance of a drop of dilute HF solution (2% vol/vol) for the subsequent TEM analysis. The Raman spectroscopy was excited by using a 532 nm laser with an estimated spot size of 1 μm and a power of ∼0.15 mW. The photoluminescence (PL) was achieved by using a 488 nm laser with a power of ∼0.15 mW. High resolution mapping images of Raman spectroscopy were achieved using a 100× objective, 1200 grooves per mm gating, and a 0.5 μm step.
3. Results and discussion
The SnSe2/MoS2 heterostructures were grown via a two-step CVD process, which is schematically illustrated in Fig. 1a. A side view for atomic structure illustration of the SnSe2/MoS2 bilayer on the SiO2/Si substrate is shown in Fig. 1b, in which the bottom MoS2 and top SnSe2 layers are stacked by weak vdWs forces. The bottom MoS2 monolayer is the 2H phase, showing a hexagonal lattice with three-fold symmetry and the atomic staking sequence (S–Mo–S) ABA, whereas the top SnSe2 crystallizes with a hexagonal space group Pm1 of the CdI2-type and the atomic staking sequence (Se–Sn–Se) ABC to form the 1T structure. The MoS2 monolayers were firstly obtained on the SiO2/Si substrate. Fig. 1c displays a typical OM image of the as-grown MoS2, showing well-defined triangular shapes with a side length up to 20 μm. We also observed that a dot emerges at the center of the MoS2 monolayers. Those dots seem to act as the nucleation sites for growing MoS2 layers. After the MoS2 sheets were synthesized on SiO2/Si, we used them as substrates for the growth of SnSe2 layers through a vdWs epitaxial growth process, in which Se vapor was employed to react with SnI2 in the presence of hydrogen/argon mixed gas at 620 °C. The morphology of SnSe2 sheets are found to rely on the deposition temperature. Fig. 1c shows a representative OM image of SnSe2/MoS2 vdWs heterostructures grown at a relative high deposition temperature (∼280 °C); irregularly shaped SnSe2 domains (indicated by red arrows) partially covering the MoS2 surface can be distinguished due to the different optical contrast. SEM images obtained by the secondary electron image (SEI) mode can further confirm the continuity and layer-by-layer stacking of SnSe2 domains (Fig. S2, ESI†). In contrast, the triangular MoS2 flakes are completely covered by the SnSe2 sheets when the MoS2 substrates are placed at a relatively low temperature zone (∼210 °C), as shown in Fig. 1d. An enlarged OM image and the corresponding AFM image of the heterostructures obtained at a relatively high temperature zone are shown in Fig. 1e and f, respectively. The heights of both SnSe2 domains and the bottom MoS2 flake are ∼1 nm, corresponding to the single layers of SnSe2 and MoS2 respectively. In addition, the difference in optical contrast between Fig. 1a and d, and AFM images (Fig. S3c, ESI†) reveal the formation of continuous and uniform SnSe2 monolayers on MoS2 at the relatively low temperature. As the growth continued for a long time (e.g. 5 min), the SnSe2 domains expand further and fully cover the MoS2 flakes at the relatively high temperature zone; remarkably thickened SnSe2 films can be obtained at both low and high temperature zones (Fig. S4, ESI†).

Both SnSe2 and MoS2 have a stable hexagonal phase with lattice constants a = b = 0.381 nm for SnSe2 and a = b = 0.316 nm for MoS2, respectively. There is a large lattice mismatch of 18.7% for the interplanar spacing of the (100) crystal plane between them. According to previous literature reports, traditional epitaxial growth generally occurs when two crystals have lattice matching.55,56 The growth of SnSe2 on MoS2 in this work is attributed to the vdWs interaction instead of chemical bonding at their interfaces. This process is so-called vdWs epitaxial growth, which was also utilized in the synthesis of other 2D crystals and their heterostructures.44,57 To further understand the mechanism of the formation of ultra-thin SnSe2 flakes on triangular MoS2, we consider the dynamic behavior of the synthetic process. Two major steps are involved in a vdWs epitaxial growth: (1) deposition of source material vapor onto substrates, and (2) diffusion of the adsorbed species on substrates.58 The diffusion process is thermally activated, in which the surface adsorbates need to overcome the diffusion barriers. Generally, the growth is governed by the competition between the deposition and diffusion processes, and the ratio of the deposition to diffusion rate is thus a key parameter in the growth.59 The ratio determines the average distance that an adsorbed species need to migrate to meet another adsorbate, either for nucleation of a new aggregate or attachment to an already formed island.59 When the substrates are located at a relatively high temperature position, the deposition rate of SnSe2 molecules is supposed to be slower than the diffusion rate, and thus the adsorbed SnSe2 molecules have enough time to explore the potential energy surface to reach a minimum energy configuration. In this case, it is worth noting that the dangling bonds at the surface of SiO2 produce a strong impediment to the nucleation and growth of SnSe2 on the SiO2 surface.60 Alternatively, the nucleation of SnSe2 generally occurs at edges, defective sites (e.g. S vacancies) or the central position (nucleation point for the MoS2 monolayer) in the MoS2 triangles with atomic flatness and surface inertness. As suggested in pioneering work, diffusion of an atom or molecule over a terrace will have a lower energy barrier than diffusion along an edge or crossing of a corner, and descending an edge is often energetically more costly than terrace diffusion.44 Therefore, the adsorbed SnSe2 molecules either on SiO2 or MoS2 surfaces could travel to meet the nucleated ones and then the growth occurs to form the vdWs heterostructures. As a result, we can see mono-, bi- or multi-layer SnSe2 flakes on triangular MoS2 (Fig. 1d). The SnSe2 monolayers often display round shapes (indicated by arrows in Fig. 1d), whereas the top layer of bilayer and multilayer SnSe2 usually exhibits triangular or quasi-hexagonal structures (Fig. 1d, f and Fig. S2, ESI†). This is probably because the migration energy of adatoms on the SnSe2 surface is lower than that on the MoS2 surface. If the substrate is located at a relatively low temperature region, the deposition rate is faster than the diffusion rate and the growth of SnSe2 tends to be determined by kinetics. As a result, high-density small-sized SnSe2 grains nucleate simultaneously on the surface, which suppresses the diffusion of adsorbed SnSe2 molecules. As the growth continues, the SnSe2 domains expand and connect to each other to fully cover the MoS2 flakes. In addition to the monolayer SnSe2 grown on the MoS2, there exist lots of SnSe2 particles on the SiO2 surface (A and B regions in Fig. 1e), further confirming that high-density nucleation forms due to the fast deposition rate. The migration distance of the adsorbed species (from the SiO2 to MoS2 surface) in the A region is much shorter compared with that in the B region, resulting in a much lower density of the residual particles in the A region than that in the B region. This further demonstrates the metastability of adsorbates on the SiO2 surface in the growth process.
Because of the utilization of Se sources in the growth of heterostructures, we need to make it clear whether the Se elements are doped into the bottom MoS2 sheets. TEM was used to directly investigate the crystal structure of the as-grown vertically stacked architecture. Fig. 2a depicts a low-magnification TEM image of the SnSe2/MoS2 heterostructures in which a clean film with partly curled edges can be seen. Fig. 2b shows the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image of the area marked by a red circle in Fig. 2a. The most striking feature under HRTEM imaging is the Moirè patterns which are caused by the interference of the lattice between SnSe2 and MoS2. This indicates the formation of single crystals of each stacked unit and high-quality of their interface. Fig. 2c shows the selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern taken from the area indicated by a red circle in Fig. 2a. According to the previous reports,61,62 we marked the zone axis of the SAED pattern. The zone axis is [001]. The interface orientation relationship between the epitaxial layers (SnSe2) and the bottom MoS2 layers is (001)SnSe2∥(001)MoS2 with [001]SnSe2∥[001]MoS2. As can be seen in Fig. 2c, two different sets of hexagonal diffraction patterns can be distinguished. These two patterns are well-aligned; the inner and outer diffraction spots correspond to the SnSe2 lattice and the MoS2 lattice, respectively. This indicates the formation of high-quality single crystals of SnSe2 and confirms that the MoS2 retains its stoichiometric composition. The well-aligned diffraction spots between SnSe2 and MoS2 indicate that the SnSe2 domains on top of MoS2 monolayers are grown via the vdWs epitaxial growth.44 On the other hand, a lattice misfit of 18.7% in this case indicates that the vdWs interaction allows the formation of vertical stacked heterostructures consisting of two large misfit 2D crystals via the vdWs epitaxial growth method. To further identify the material composition, the EDS of SnSe2/MoS2 heterostructures was obtained, as shown in Fig. 1d. These results confirm that the sample is composed of Sn, Se, Mo and S.

Raman spectroscopy is a powerful tool for the noninvasive characterization of 2D materials and their heterostructures.45,63Fig. 3a shows an OM image of monolayer MoS2 sheets partially covered by SnSe2 domains with various thicknesses. According to the optical contrast in Fig. 3a, we can assume that spots A and B correspond to the bare MoS2 monolayer (base layer) and SnSe2/MoS2 bilayers, and the SnSe2 flakes appear to become successively thicker from spot B to spot E. The Raman spectra acquired from spot A–E are illustrated in Fig. 3b. All of those spectra display two typical Raman modes for MoS2, i.e. E12g (in-plane) and A1g (out-of-plane) modes. We find that the bare MoS2 exhibits a strong out-of-plane mode at 404.1 cm−1 and an in-plane mode at 384.7 cm−1. The separation between two vibrational peaks is 19.4 cm−1, further confirming the monolayer feature of MoS2 on SiO2. In addition to the A1g and E12g modes from MoS2, the SnSe2/MoS2 heterostructures show another two vibrational modes, i.e. in-plane (Eg) and out-of-plane (A1g) modes of SnSe2 (B–E spectra in Fig. 3b). According to the previous reports, the Raman vibrational modes of 2D-crystals are expected to be sensitive to interlayer interaction.63 We first focus on the Raman spectra for MoS2. The additional layer of SnSe2 causes the E12g peak to shift from 384.7 to 383.7 cm−1, as shown in Fig. 3c. The peak position does not change with increasing the thickness of top SnSe2 in the heterostructures. This indicates that the red shift of the E12g mode is caused only by direct contact with SnSe2 and not by the layer number of SnSe2 grown on MoS2. The softening of the E12g mode (∼1 cm−1) indicates that the bottom MoS2 appears to be stretched as the additional SnSe2 layers are epitaxially grown on and the in-plane stretching only originates from the interfacial contact with SnSe2. We note that similar red shifts of the E12g mode of MoS2 have been found in other MoS2-based vertical heterostructures such as MoS2/WS2, MoS2/graphene, and MoS2/MoTe2 in previous reports.33,36,41,42,64 Concerning the out-of-plane A1g mode, a slight red-shift of ∼0.5 cm−1 is observed in the heterostructures relative to the bare MoS2 (Fig. 3c), which is not in agreement with the finding that the A1g mode of MoS2 generally stiffens as additional layers (e.g. WS2, graphene) are added to form heterostructures using either mechanical exfoliation42 or the CVD method.36 It is worth noting that the peak positions of three MoSe2 modes (i.e. A1g, E1g and E12g) did not shift when GaSe atomic layers were grown on top of the MoSe2via an epitaxial CVD process.44 We assume that a high quality of interfacial contact could be achieved in the vertically stacked heterostructures by using the vdWs epitaxial growth process. In this case, the slight red-shift of the out-of-plane mode of MoS2 is probably because of the strong interaction with the substrate34 and strong interlayer charge transfer44,65 in the heterostructures. Fig. 3d depicts a magnified view of the in-plane mode (Eg) and the out-of-plane mode (A1g) of SnSe2. The peak position of A1g does not shift, whereas its peak intensity enhances firstly with an increase of the layer number but reduces for bulk. The layer-number dependent intensity is probably caused by the optical interference effect. There is an obvious blue-shift for the Eg mode with an increase of the layer-number. This is inconsistent with the SnSe2 2D-crystals on the SiO2/Si substrate made by using the mechanical exfoliation method. Therefore, we suppose that the peak distance between A1g and Eg is capable of identifying SnSe2 thickness. We note that the Raman spectra of SnSe2/MoS2 bilayers obtained at a low-temperature zone is in agreement with that at the high-temperature zone, as shown in Fig. S3d (ESI†).

To examine the uniformity of the heterostructures, the Raman mapping investigation was achieved, as shown in Fig. 4. The Raman intensity map of the A1g mode of SnSe2 shows the uniformity of SnSe2 on triangular MoS2 flakes except for a small area indicated by the arrow (Fig. 4a and b). The Raman intensity maps of E12g and A1g modes of MoS2 are shown in Fig. 4c and d, respectively. The intensity of both modes slightly increases with SnSe2 grown on top. This is similar to the MoSe2/GaSe vertical heterostructures in which the Raman modes in both MoSe2 and GaSe were slightly enhanced.44 The enhancement of two Raman modes of MoS2 is probably attributed to strong interlayer charge transfer21 and optical interference.64Fig. 4e and f show the peak-position maps of E12g and A1g modes of MoS2, respectively, further confirming the slight softening of both E12g and A1g modes due to the additional SnSe2 flakes. It is noticed that a small-sized bilayer of SnSe2 is also observed in Fig. 4a and b (indicated by arrows). The corresponding bottom MoS2 is likely to be a bilayer as the frequency difference of two characteristic peaks (A1g and E12g) is ∼21 cm−1 (indicated by arrows in Fig. 4e and f). These results further demonstrate that the nucleation and growth of SnSe2 occur firstly at the defective sites in the bottom MoS2, as mentioned above. The Raman maps of multilayer SnSe2 on MoS2 are also obtained, as shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†). The slight red-shift and intensity enhancement of the E12g and A1g modes of MoS2 are observed as well in this heterostructure.

The interaction of SnSe2 with MoS2 layers also affects the PL emissions in their vdWs heterostructures. Fig. 5a shows the typical room-temperature PL spectra of bare MoS2 and the SnSe2/MoS2 bilayer. These PL spectra were obtained under the same conditions and not normalized, and thus their PL intensity can be directly compared. For bare MoS2, a dominant emission peak locates at 1.84 eV with a much weaker peak at 1.96 eV (Fig. S6, ESI†), corresponding to the recombination of the A and B excitons, respectively. However, the PL intensity of both A and B exciton emissions from the SnSe2/MoS2 heterostructures are strongly quenched by ∼20 times of the original bare MoS2 monolayer (Fig. 5a). Besides, the peak position of A exciton emission in the MoS2 monolayer also displays a red-shift of ∼50 meV when a monolayer SnSe2 is grown on. This may be caused by the strong interlayer charge transfer in the SnSe2/MoS2 bilayer and the weakened quantum confinement effect along the vertical direction. No emission bands from SnSe2 are detected probably due to its indirect band-gap and the strong interlayer charge transfer in the heterostructures. According to previous reports,45,48 we can infer the band offsets between SnSe2 and MoS2 monolayers (Fig. 5b). As can be seen in Fig. 5b, the MoS2 and SnSe2 monolayers have band-gaps of 1.83 eV and 0.96 eV, respectively; the conduction band minimum of SnSe2 is about 1 eV lower than that of MoS2; the valence band maximum of the monolayer of SnSe2 is close to or a little smaller than that of monolayer MoS2. The photo-excited electrons in MoS2 therefore prefer to transfer to SnSe2. Consequently, the PL emissions in MoS2 are weakened significantly. The efficient charge transfer in the SnSe2/MoS2 vertical heterostructures holds promise for electronic and optoelectronic applications.

4. Conclusions
In summary, vertically stacked SnSe2/MoS2 2D heterostructures with a large lattice misfit have been synthesized by using a two-step CVD method. The MoS2 monolayers were firstly grown on SiO2/Si substrates followed by the vdWs epitaxial growth of single-crystalline SnSe2 monolayers on the top of the MoS2 monolayers. The epitaxial layers (SnSe2) exhibit well-aligned lattice orientation with the underneath layers (MoS2) and can be modulated to partially or fully cover MoS2 by controlling the growth conditions. Interlayer coupling and charge transfer are observed in such stacked 2D heterostructures through Raman and PL spectroscopies. These results indicate that the vertically stacked SnSe2/MoS2 heterostructures have potential applications in electronics and optoelectronics. Besides, the vdWs epitaxial growth process in this work appears to be a general technique that could be extended to fabricate other vertical heterostructures consisting of a TMD and IVA–VIA semiconductors.
