    , Accepted 1st June 2019First published on 3rd June 2019AbstractIn this work, porphyrin-based MOF nanosheets were formulated. The as-developed Gd-TCPP MOF nanosheets could be protonated significantly in an acidic solution, which greatly enhanced the UV-vis absorption at 665 nm. Also, a significant structural reorganization occurred to achieve a nanowire structure. As the center of the porphyrin had a metal coordination atom, the Q band absorption had better stability due to their inability to be protonated. These results confirm that the UV-vis absorption of the MOFs can be regulated via porphyrin protonation, and the protonation of the nanosheets in the acidic solution can be avoided by adding a metal coordination atom to the porphyrin center. We also found that zinc ions had better coordination ability with the pyrrole nitrogen of the inner porphyrin core of Gd-TCPP MOF nanosheets. Finally, the protonation of MOFs was confirmed by the yield of singlet oxygen. Also, metallic oxide nanoparticles can be formed in situ and adsorbed on the Gd-TCPP MOF nanosheets. These results are useful for the preparation of metallic oxide nanoparticle-loaded nanomaterials. This work may open novel avenues for changing the UV-vis absorption of porphyrin-based nanomaterials.
1. Introduction
Porphyrins, as an attractive building block, can be self-assembled into different nanostructures due to their planar, conjugated, and rigid structure.1–3 Owing to their unique properties and microstructure, a variety of porphyrin-based nanomaterials have been investigated.4–8 In particular, porphyrin-based metal–organic framework (MOF) nanomaterials have received increasing attention owing to their good crystallinity, high porosity, tunable structure, and large surface area.9–12 Zhou et al.13 prepared Zr-based porphyrin MOF nanoparticles and found that this MOF structural materials has better photodynamic therapy (PDT) efficacy than the porphyrin organic ligand molecules alone. Besides, a series of porphyrin-based MOF nanosheets were synthesized by Lin et al., who concluded that these MOF nanosheets can produce singlet oxygen (1O2) more efficiently because of intersystem crossing and increased diffusion in porous structure.14–16 The periodic networks were assembled from inorganic metal nodes and porphyrin ligands in an isotropic manner, which provided MOFs with excellent properties for gas storage and separation, solar fuel conversion, photocatalytic water splitting, biological imaging, and photodynamic therapy.17–21 The MOF structure also had more exposed active sites, facilitated charge transport, and effectively increased the photosensitivity of the photosensitizers.
The porphyrins can be effectively used as photosensitizers due to their attractive optical properties, ultrafast electron injection, and high absorption coefficient to light harvesting.22–25 These superb properties promote the sensitive reaction of porphyrins with molecular oxygen, which could convert ground state oxygen to 1O2via energy transfer and superoxide anion via electron transfer under suitable light conditions.26–29 The yield of 1O2 is related to the molar extinction coefficient of the materials and the light intensity. Therefore, increasing the molar extinction coefficient of the porphyrin-based materials can improve the yield of 1O2 under the same light intensity conditions. We propose the possibility of improving the efficiency of 1O2 generation in porphyrin-based MOF nanomaterials through enhancing the molar extinction coefficient.
We have already formulated the Zn-TCPP and Gd-TCPP MOF nanosheets previously.30,31 The prepared Zn-TCPP and Gd-TCPP MOF nanosheets were treated with hydrochloric acid. We confirmed that protonation occurred in the Gd-TCPP MOF nanosheets, which greatly improved the UV-vis absorption at 665 nm. A significant structural reorganization occurred in the process to form the nanowire structure. However, the Zn-TCPP MOF nanosheets with central coordination metal did not show these results. We found that zinc ions had good coordination ability with the porphyrin core. This Zn-coordinated MOF nanomaterial once again confirmed the absence of protonation. To the best of our knowledge, the improvement of the yield of 1O2 of porphyrin-based MOF nanomaterials via protonation has not been reported. Also, the metallic oxide nanoparticles can be formed in situ and adsorbed onto the Gd-TCPP MOF nanosheets. This phenomenon may also lead to exciting results in other aspects of MOF structures and properties and may inspire further research.
2. Experimental section
Materials
4,4,4,4-(Porphine-5,10,15,20-tetrayl) tetrakis (benzenesulfonic acid) (TPPS), gadolinium(III) chloride, and 1,3-diphenylisobenzofuran (DPBF) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Corporation. 4,4,4,4-(Porphine-5,10,15,20-tetrayl) tetrakis (benzoic acid) (TCPP), 4,4′-biphenyldicarboxylic acid, zinc nitrate hexahydrate, manganese chloride, magnesium chloride, ferric chloride, cupric chloride, and zinc chloride were obtained from Aladdin Chemical Corporation. All other chemicals were of analytical grade and used without further purification. Deionized water was prepared using a Milli-Q purification system.
Synthesis of Gd-TCPP MOF nanosheets
The Gd-TCPP MOF nanosheets were obtained according to the previous research results.31 Briefly, a mixture of TCPP (10 μmol), GdCl3 (5 μmol), H2O (1.0 mL), and N,N-dimethylformamide (22 mL) was heated to 60 °C and reacted for 4 h under stirring. The purple-red products were obtained by centrifugation and washing with ethanol several times.
Synthesis of Zn-TCPP MOF nanosheets
The Zn-TCPP MOF nanosheets were prepared according to the previous research results.30 Briefly, a mixture of TCPP (2.0 mg), Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (5.0 mg), H2O (2.0 mL), 4,4′-biphenyldicarboxylic acid (2.0 mg), and N,N-dimethylformamide (12 mL) was heated to 150 °C and reacted for 1 h under stirring. Then, the Zn-TCPP products were obtained by centrifugation and washed with ethanol several times.
Synthesis of Gd-TCPP/M MOF nanohybrids
In a typical procedure of Gd-TCPP/M nanohybrid preparation, 1.0 mL of 0.01 mM Gd-TCPP MOF suspension in N,N-dimethylformamide and 1.0 mL of 0.01 mM ZnCl2 (MnCl2, MgCl2, FeCl3, CuCl2) aqueous solution were added to a 50 mL round-bottomed flask. Then, 18 mL of DMF was added to form a homogeneous solution, and the mixture was heated to 80 °C and reacted for 2 h (the reaction time of FeCl3 is 6 h) under stirring. The Gd-ZnTCPP/ZnO (Gd-TCPP/MnO, Gd-TCPP/MgO, Gd-TCPP/Fe2O3, and Gd-TCPP/CuO) products were collected by centrifugation and washed several times with ethanol.
The protonation of the Gd-TCPP MOF nanosheets
To test the protonation of the Gd-TCPP MOF nanosheets, 2 mL of Gd-TCPP dispersion with the UV-vis absorption intensity at a peak value of 3.481 was centrifuged to obtain the MOF nanosheets. Then, 2 mL of HCl solution with pH = 6.0, 5.5, 5.0, 4.5, 4.0, 3.5, 3.0, 2.5, 2.0, 1.5, 1.0, and 0.5 was added to disperse the Gd-TCPP MOF nanosheets, respectively. Stirring for 30 min at room temperature, the residual rate of the Gd-TCPP MOF nanosheets was determined by measuring the UV-vis absorption of the supernatants after centrifugation. Under acidic conditions, the Gd-TCPP MOF nanosheets did not show obvious dissolution. Even at an acidic pH of 0.5, only 5.7% of the Gd-TCPP MOF nanosheets remained in the solution after centrifugation. At the same time, a noticeable color change was observed under acidic conditions.
Characterization studies
The morphology and size of the nanomaterials were characterized by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Quanta 400 FEG, USA). High-resolution and high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, HAADF-STEM) images were obtained using an HT7700 microscope (Hitachi, Japan). UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded using a 1280 UV-visible spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Japan).
3. Results and discussion
As shown in Fig. 1a and b, Zn-TCPP and Gd-TCPP MOF nanosheets were obtained by reacting zinc ions (or gadolinium ions) and 4,4,4,4-(porphine-5,10,15,20-tetrayl) tetrakis (benzoic acid) (TCPP) in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) solvent by a conventional solution reaction. As shown in Fig. 1d, the Zn-TCPP MOF nanosheets exhibited a strong Söret absorption at 435 nm together with two Q bands owing to the S0 → S2 and S0 → S1 transitions, confirming that the TCPP ligand was centrally-metallated with zinc ions.32,33 In contrast, the TCPP ligand in Gd-TCPP was not centrally-metallated. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) also confirmed that no metal coordination occurred at the center of TCPP in Gd-TCPP MOFs. As shown in Fig. S1,† the absorption peaks at 3316 and 964 cm−1 are attributed to N–H stretching vibration and N–H in-plane vibration. This phenomenon suggests that the proton in the porphyrin center was not replaced by the gadolinium ions. In addition, the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) and X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) analyses of the Gd-TCPP MOFs were also analyzed in Fig. S1.† The approximate type I Langmuir isotherms and amorphous structures are consistent with those of the Gd-TCPP MOFs that were previously reported.31

Under acidic conditions, the Gd-TCPP MOF nanosheets did not show clear dissolution. Even at an acidic pH of 0.5, only 5.7% of the Gd-TCPP MOF nanosheets remained in the solution after centrifugation (Fig. S2a†). However, the Q bands changed significantly and a unique absorption at 665 nm was observed for both the acid-treated Gd-TCPP MOF nanosheets (Fig. 1e) and the Gd-TCPP MOF residues in the solution (Fig. S2b†). The absorption data confirmed that the porphyrin molecules underwent significant changes after the acid treatment. The green products shown in Fig. 1e may be due to the protonation of porphyrins in the Gd-TCPP MOF nanosheets, as per the literature reports.34 Meanwhile, the morphology of Gd-TCPP was changed from nanosheets to nanowires, suggesting that protonation not only changed the UV-vis absorption of Gd-TCPP but also led to the structural reorganization of Gd and TCPP (Fig. 1c). Then, the acid-treated Gd-TCPP MOFs (Gd-(H2TCPP)2+) were analyzed by FT-IR, XRD, and BET analyses. As shown in Fig. S3,† the peak positions of the infrared spectrum and XRD pattern of the Gd-(H2TCPP)2+ did not change significantly. There are still the N–H stretching vibration and N–H in-plane vibration at 3315 and 964 cm−1, respectively. The result confirmed that acid protonation did not affect the already coordinated N atoms in the porphyrin core. However, the changes in morphology reduced its specific surface area from 646.4 to 169.96 m2 g−1. To understand the principle of protonation, acid treatment was conducted on the Zn-TCPP MOF nanosheets (pH = 1.0) and protonation analysis was performed. As shown in Fig. S4,† UV-vis absorption of Zn-TCPP MOF nanosheets hardly changed under strong acidic conditions. The inner core of TCPP in the Zn-TCPP MOF nanostructure was occupied by a zinc atom, which hindered the coordination of proton with the nitrogen groups. Therefore, the Zn-TCPP MOF nanosheets cannot be protonated in an acidic environment.
To further verify the protonation of porphyrins, TCPP and 4,4,4,4-(porphine-5,10,15,20-tetrayl) tetrakis (benzenesulfonic acid) (TPPS) were also analyzed. UV-vis spectra of TCPP are shown in Fig. 2. The absorption peaks at 515 and 549 nm gradually decreased with the increasing concentration of hydrochloric acid, while the absorption peak at 646 nm increased. At the same time, the absorption peak of 646 nm in the Q bands red-shifted to 653 nm, indicating that the TCPP can be effectively protonated under strong acid conditions. In addition, an absorption peak at 443 nm appeared, while the absorption of the Söret band at 415 nm red-shifted and combined with the absorption peak of 443 nm, resulting in a relatively broad absorption peak. Because of the non-covalent interactions such as π–π stacking, hydrophobic–hydrophobic, and hydrogen bonding, porphyrins were prone to H-aggregate or J-aggregate in the solution. The protonated porphyrin molecule (H2TCPP)2+ induced strong charge repulsion between the porphyrin molecules, hindering the π–π stacking and making it difficult to effectively perform H-aggregation. Therefore, a significant change in the Söret band absorption peak at 443 nm confirmed the J-aggregation of the protonated porphyrin. These results were further confirmed by TPPS. As shown in Fig. S5,†H-aggregation was blocked by protonated porphyrin (H2TPPS)2+ and J-aggregation was finally achieved. Moreover, the protonated porphyrin molecules could be recovered by neutralization reaction via the addition of alkaline solution (Fig. S6†). However, as shown in Fig. S7,† when the porphyrin center was occupied by a metal, protonation was remarkably suppressed.

Subsequently, to analyze the protonation mechanism, the porphyrin ligands in Gd-TCPP MOF nanosheets were metal-coordinated. As shown in Fig. 3, the metallic oxide nanoparticles can be formed in situ through the direct interaction between the Gd-TCPP MOF nanosheets and metal ions, and they then adsorbed onto the Gd-TCPP MOF nanosheets (named MOFs/M nanohybrids). Thus, the Gd-TCPP MOF nanosheets decorated with the metallic oxide nanoparticles were synthesized by using this simple non-surfactant assisted synthetic method. After a series of related characterization studies, we also confirmed that zinc ions could coordinate with the pyrrole nitrogen of the inner porphyrin core, while other metal ions (manganese ions, magnesium ions, iron ions, and copper ions) had difficulty forming metalloporphyrins in the MOF/M nanohybrids. The morphology and structural characterization of Gd-ZnTCPP/ZnO MOF nanohybrids prepared at 80 °C are shown in Fig. 4. The 2D morphology and the corresponding lattice fringes of the MOFs can be clearly observed using TEM and HAADF-STEM. By the addition of zinc ions and co-heating in the MOF solution, we found that ZnO nanoparticles can be effectively grown in situ and support the MOF structure. The HAADF-STEM image in Fig. 4b illustrates that the MOF superstructure was not destroyed. In order to confirm the versatility of Gd-TCPP MOFs as nano-platforms, foreign ions such as Mn2+, Mg2+, Fe3+, and Cu2+ were added and investigated. The TEM and EDS images in Fig. S8† confirmed that metal ions can be grown into nanoparticles in situ and loaded on the MOF structure. Among these, the larger iron oxide nanoparticles in Fig. S8c† were formed due to longer reaction time. Compared with Gd-TCPP MOF nanosheets, the XRD patterns of MOFs/M nanohybrids (Fig. S9†) did not change significantly, which may be due to the small size of the formed metallic oxide nanoparticles. Clear Tyndall light scattering in Fig. S10† also shows that the Gd-TCPP MOF nanosheets can be effectively used in the reduction and loading of metallic oxide nanoparticles, while the MOF superstructure remained intact.

The UV-vis spectra of MOFs/M nanohybrids are presented in Fig. 5. With the formation of MOFs/M nanohybrids, the UV-vis absorption of Gd-TCPP/MnO, Gd-TCPP/MgO, and Gd-TCPP/Fe2O3 nanohybrids did not change significantly, confirming that the in situ reduction of metal nanoparticles had no effect on the overall structure of MOFs. In the case of Gd-ZnTCPP/ZnO nanohybrids, the Söret absorption red-shifted to 426 nm and two weak Q bands at 560 and 599 nm were observed, indicating that the zinc ions coordinated with the pyrrole nitrogen groups from the inner porphyrin core. The metal Gd in the original Gd-TCPP MOFs does not enter the porphyrin core, and the Q band exhibited four weak absorption peaks. After the metal Zn entered the porphyrin core, the Q band absorption peak merged and changed from four to two. Furthermore, as shown in Fig. S11,† N–H stretching vibration and N–H in-plane vibration at 3316 and 964 cm−1, respectively, disappeared, and a new peak appeared at 998 cm−1, which confirmed the core metallization of the porphyrin ligand in the Gd-ZnTCPP/ZnO nanohybrids. These results demonstrate that zinc ions more easily entered the center of the porphyrin inner ring to form Zn-coordinated metalloporphyrin, and the Q-band absorption is consistent with our previous results.30 In addition, the Q-band absorption of Gd-TCPP/CuO nanohybrids also underwent a small change, which may be due to poor coordination of the pyrrole nitrogen groups with copper. Since MOFs/M nanohybrids were only loaded with nanoparticles, their pore size distribution did not change significantly, and the specific surface area was slightly reduced (Fig. S12†). To elucidate the detailed structure of the loaded metallic oxide nanoparticles, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed to characterize the MOFs/M nanohybrids. As shown in Fig. S13,† the XPS measurements explored the deconvolution of the N 1s spectrum of Gd-TCPP, Gd-TCPP/MgO, and Gd-ZnTCPP/ZnO. The Gd-TCPP and Gd-TCPP/MgO had two types of N atoms, iminic (397.7 eV, –CN–) and pyrrolic (399.8 eV, –NH–) nitrogen.35 This result confirmed that metal ions do not coordinate with the nitrogen element of the porphyrin to form a four-coordinated metalloporphyrin. For Gd-ZnTCPP/ZnO nanohybrids, the pyrrolic (–NH–) nitrogen was significantly reduced, confirming that metalloporphyrin was formed by the central coordination reaction. These results are consistent with the UV-vis absorption and FT-IR spectrum. The Mg 1s peak at 1304.4 eV is typical of magnesium in its oxidized form Mg2+.36,37 The binding energies at 1022.1 and 1045.2 eV in the Zn 2p region are assigned to Zn 2p1/2 and Zn 2p3/2, respectively.38–40 In addition, the metal Gd did not change in the XPS spectrum, indicating that Gd as a coordination node was not replaced by other metals.

Thereafter, the MOFs/M nanohybrids were treated with hydrochloric acid (pH = 1.0), and the results were analyzed. As shown in Fig. 6, there was strong Söret absorption of Gd-TCPP/MnO, Gd-TCPP/MgO, Gd-TCPP/Fe2O3, and Gd-TCPP/CuO nanohybrids at 415 nm, which is consistent with the absorption of the TCPP (Fig. 2). The accompanying shoulders may be due to the J-aggregation of porphyrin molecules. These MOFs/M nanohybrids also exhibited protonation-induced Q-band absorption at 660 nm. The residual Fe2O3 nanoparticles in the solution can be observed in Fig. S14,† while the nanoparticles of the loaded MnO, MgO, and CuO were extremely small and could not be observed. In contrast, the Q-band absorption of Gd-ZnTCPP/ZnO nanohybrids did not change significantly, which confirmed that the coordination of zinc with the porphyrin core successfully hindered the protonation of porphyrin molecules. However, its Söret absorption also underwent significant changes, which may be due to the partial destruction of the structure of MOFs because of the reaction of ZnO nanoparticles with acid (Fig. S15†).

By consideration of the above analysis, the porphyrin molecules that were unoccupied at the inner core could be protonated in an acidic solution, and the Q bands in the UV-vis absorption changed significantly. As shown in Table S1,† there is a significant correlation between the porphyrin core and the Q band absorption. Protonation of the porphyrin ligand results in a unique Q band absorption of the MOF materials. For porphyrin monomolecule, the protonation induces charge repulsion between the molecules, hindering the intermolecular π–π stacking and eventually forming J-aggregates. Meanwhile, as shown in Fig. 1e, 2, 6 and S2b, S5,† the UV-vis absorption intensity of the Q bands at 650–670 nm was greatly improved, which may have a better effect on the use of porphyrins for photodynamic therapy. The wavelength of light required for photodynamic therapy is generally in the range of 600–800 nm. The reason is that long waves can provide an effective treatment window, i.e., the region between the hemoglobin absorption and water absorption, which increases the penetration distance of light in the tissue structure and effectively reaches the depth of the tumor tissue. Lin et al.14,15 prepared nanoscale DBP-UiO and chlorin-based DBC-UiO MOFs successively and found that the dihydro-substituted porphyrin MOFs had higher UV-vis absorption at about 660 nm, which is three times as efficient as DBP-UiO in generating singlet oxygen and exhibited significantly higher PDT cytotoxicity for tumor cells. Thus, protonation can significantly increase the UV-vis absorption at 660 nm, which may provide another route to enhancing the yield of singlet oxygen.
To investigate the ability of protonated Gd-TCPP (Gd-(H2TCPP)2+) to generate 1O2, 1,3-diphenylisobenzofuran (DPBF) was used as a probe to capture 1O2, which quenched the UV-vis absorption of the probe. As shown in Fig. 7, a straight line of the absorbance-concentration for DPBF was observed, and the linear regression equation was y = −0.004 + 10.06x with the correlation coefficient of 0.99. The photobleaching was carried out with deep-red 660 nm light at the power density of 100 mW cm−2. The control experiment is presented in Fig. 7c. The UV-vis absorption intensity of DPBF was stable under light for 30 min with a negligible change. In the presence of Gd-TCPP MOF nanosheets, the UV-vis absorption intensity of DPBF was decreased for an illumination time of 0–20 min. These results confirm that the Gd-TCPP MOF nanosheets can effectively produce 1O2, which led to a decrease in the UV-vis absorption of DPBF. The Gd-(H2TCPP)2+ could rapidly reduce the absorption intensity of DPBF and almost completely degrade in 5 min, while the Gd-TCPP MOF nanosheets took about 20 min under the same conditions. The reaction rate constant (k) for the production of 1O2 by Gd-TCPP and Gd-(H2TCPP)2+ in DPBF was calculated and is presented in Fig. 7d. The k value of Gd-(H2TCPP)2+ was 0.851 min−1, while that of Gd-TCPP was 0.155 min−1. The formation of Gd-(H2TCPP)2+ effectively enhanced the yield of singlet oxygen under illumination at 660 nm, confirming that the higher UV-vis absorption plays a crucial role in promoting the 1O2 production.

The inset is the logarithm of the normalized UV-vis absorption intensity as a function of the irradiation time for the DPBF. 
For a change in the morphology of Gd-TCPP, a simple analysis was performed by reducing the degree of protonation. As shown in Fig. S16,† the Gd-TCPP MOFs is formed by stacking interactions of nanosheets, and there is a weak van der Waals force between the layers.30,31 The protonated porphyrin ligands induced strong charge repulsion between the layers, destroying van der Waals force and forming the voile-like sheets. These sheets are easily curled and bonded to each other, forming shorter and thinner nanowires. Then, as the degree of protonation increased, these short nanowires continue to be recombinant and coupled, resulting in longer and coarser nanowires (Fig. S17†). This also explains why the FT-IR and XRD of Gd-TCPP and Gd-(H2TCPP)2+ have not changed significantly. The Gd-ZnTCPP/ZnO nanohybrids in Fig. S15† did not generate nanowires, which is probably because the interlayer van der Waals force is not destroyed, and only the reaction between hydrochloric acid and nanoparticles occurs. In the case of a change in topography, we are still in the inferential stage and the system needs to be explored further.
4. Conclusions
The porphyrins underwent protonation in an acidic environment with UV-vis absorption enhancement in the range of 650–670 nm. This wavelength has a good penetration effect on the tissue and is suitable for PDT treatment. For the Gd-TCPP MOF nanosheets, the protonation also caused structural reorganization to form nanowires. When the center of porphyrin had a metal coordination atom (such as Zn-TCPP and Gd-ZnTCPP/ZnO), the Q band absorption had better stability due to their inability to be protonated. These results confirm that the UV-vis absorption of the nanomaterials can be regulated via porphyrin protonation and the protonation of the nanomaterials in the acidic solution can be avoided by adding a metal coordination atom to the porphyrin center. Also, we found that zinc ions had good coordination ability with the porphyrin core. These studies have important implications for understanding the UV-vis absorption of porphyrin-based nanomaterials in acidic solutions. Also, the metallic oxide nanoparticles can be formed in situ and adsorbed onto the Gd-TCPP MOF nanosheets. These studies have opened up another route for modifying the properties of porphyrin-based nanomaterials.
