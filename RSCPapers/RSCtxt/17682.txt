The energy from visible light suffices to drive the device owing to a built-in electric field (BEF) induced by the differences between the Fermi levels of SWNTs and n-Si.
There is a pressing need for novel gas sensing technologies for addressing the problems of energy crises and air pollution. Previous efforts mainly focused on reducing the sensor's power consumption via lowering the operating temperature. The most popular method is synthesizing novel nanomaterials and nano-composites to fabricate room temperature gas sensors.1–4 Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) have shown great sensitivity to various gases with a series of unique properties such as high mobility (∼105 cm2 (V s)−1), on/off current ratio (>105), current carrying capacity (>109 A cm−2) and large surface area.5–10 Dube et al. presented gas sensors based on carbon nanotubes and systematically investigated the electrical response and sensing mechanism of the sensor to various gases.9 Zhou et al. reported a printed thin-film transistor with high sensitivity (∼96%) and fast response (30 s) to 60 ppm NO2.10 In addition, it is acknowledged that light illumination may help lower the power consumption in gas sensors. Comini et al.11 reported that UV illumination greatly enhanced the gas sensing performance (e.g. sensitivity and response and recovery time) of In2O3 and SnO2 by changing the concentration of adsorption centers and the density of free carriers. Several studies also demonstrated that UV irradiation can diminish the power consumption by reducing the working temperature of devices.12–14
Although there are many room temperature gas sensors available such as the chemiresistive,5,15,16 field-effect-transitive1 and capacitive gas sensors,17 all of them are driven by applying a considerable source–drain bias (Vds) which requires external power. Therefore, developing self-powered devices has attracted considerable attention. Compared with conventional semiconductor gas sensors, self-powered sensors can dramatically reduce the power consumption as well as the required space for integration. Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs), which can harvest mechanical energy from the ambient environment to power micro-devices or generate a read-out signal, have been intensively investigated.18–20 A few recent studies have also implemented self-powered devices which are activated by light based on a p–n junction.21–24 The existing BEF can separate photogenerated carriers which facilitate to drive devices under light illumination. For example, Hoffmann et al.22,23 reported two kinds of self-powered gas sensors based on n-ZnO/p-Si and CdS@n-ZnO/p-Si, respectively. As the band gap of ZnO (3.37 eV) is large, the photovoltaic self-powered gas sensor based on n-ZnO/p-Si can only be activated by UV light.22 By adopting a relative narrow bandgap material CdS (∼2.4 eV), the absorption spectrum of the device was expanded to visible light, but the fabrication method and the structure were rather complicated.23 Hence, to effectively fabricate the self-powered gas sensor based on the p–n junction, the carrier mobility of the sensing materials and the ease of the fabrication process must be considered. In this study, based on our previous work,24 p-SWNTs and n-Si were employed to fabricate the photovoltaic self-powered gas sensor with a simple p–n heterojunction structure to address the aforementioned problems. SWNTs are flexible one-dimensional materials that can be easily interconnected into two-dimensional networks to serve as transparent electrodes for charge collection and transport and also work as sensing materials for gas molecule detection.25 Compared with the conventional chemiresistive gas sensor based on SWNTs, the sensitivity of the photovoltaic self-powered gas sensor enhanced 4.5 fold, and the response time also improved dramatically. The device has shown a linear response to 100–800 ppb H2S (R2 = 0.996) when illuminated under visible light (λ = 600 nm, P = 1.8 mW cm−2). The influence of different wavelengths has been investigated by controlling the power density of light as a constant.
The fabrication of the gas sensor is shown in Fig. S1.† The patterned microelectrodes were fabricated by photolithography, which has been reported in our previous work.24 Briefly, a SiO2 thin layer was removed by reactive ion etching, followed by sequentially sputtering Ti (∼20 nm in thickness) and a Au (∼150 nm) thin film onto the Si and SiO2 layer, respectively (FHR, Germany). The distance between the Ti/Au electrodes and bare silicon was controlled to be 40 μm. SWNT powder ((7, 6) chirality, carbon >90%, ≥77% (semiconducting carbon nanotubes), Sigma) was purified, refer to our previous work, before being well dispersed in dimethylformamide (DMF) via tip sonication.26 The as-prepared SWNT dispersion was then drop-cast onto the prefabricated sensor chip to form a SWNT thin film on the surface of silicon. To totally remove the solvent left in the SWNT thin film and to reduce the contact barrier between the SWNTs and the Ti/Au electrode, the prepared devices were annealed in a tube furnace under pure Ar gas at 300 °C for 20 minutes. For comparison, sensors based on SWNT-only and n-Si-only were fabricated by sputtering source–drain electrodes on both the sides of the SWNT-only film and bare n-Si, respectively, and then annealed under the same conditions.
The morphologies of the SWNT films were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JEOL Hitachi-s4800). The current density–voltage (J–V) curves were obtained using an Agilent B1500A with a potential ranging from −2 V to 2 V at room temperature, while the open-circuit voltage–time (Voc–t) curves were obtained by using an electrochemical workstation (CHI660D, Chenhua Shanghai, China) with open circuit voltage–time mode at zero bias. The LED light UVEC-4 (Shenzhen Lamplic Tech Co., Ltd) was used as the light source, and the power density of the light can be regulated from 0 mW cm−2 to 50 mW cm−2.

Fig. 1a shows the schematic of the photovoltaic self-powered H2S sensor based on SWNT/Si heterojunctions. One Ti/Au electrode (marked as electrode B) directly contacts with n-Si at the bottom, while the other electrode (marked as electrode A) is deposited on the SiO2 layer and contacts with the SWNT thin film. The whole contacting area of the SWNT/Si is 500 × 500 μm2, which is composed of five identical parts with the same area (each part is 100 μm × 500 μm). Fig. 1b shows the SEM image of the device based on SWNT/Si. As shown in Fig. 1c, there is an obvious ledge at the interface of Si and SiO2, indicating that n-Si is connected by a uniform porous and mesh-like SWNT film. The EDX results of two locations (Si/SWNTs and Si/SiO2/SWNTs) are tested and shown in Fig. S2.† The contents of the C atom in both the locations are very low which can indicate that the SWNT film is very thin.

Electrode A (Ti/Au) is sputtered on a SiO2 layer, while electrode B (Ti/Au) is on the bare n-Si. The SWNT film acts as a bridge to connect bare Si and electrode A. (b, c) The general SEM image of the device and the local area SEM image of the device covered with the SWNT film. The distance between the electrodes on SiO2 and the bare n-Si is 40 μm. (d) The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the self-power H2S sensor under the dark and illuminated conditions (λ = 600 nm, P = 1.8 mW cm−2, applied potential: −2 V to 2 V). The red line is the J–V curve of the self-power sensor in the dark state, while the dark line is the J–V curve when exposed to light. 

Fig. 1d displays the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the SWNT/Si heterojunction in the dark and light state (λ = 600 nm, P = 1.8 mW cm−2). In the dark, the device demonstrates rectification characteristics, which is caused by the heterojunction formed between the SWNTs and n-Si due to the differential Fermi level of SWNTs and n-Si.27,28 When switched to the light state, a photogenerated current density (Jsc) is observed (around 0.81 mA cm−2) at zero bias. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the device is ∼3.5%, which is enough to power the sensor for real-time gas sensing. Several recent reports on pristine SWNT/Si-based solar cells also reveal that the PCEs are within 5%.29,30 However, the I–V curves of the SWNT-only and n-Si-only sensors show a linear relationship, which indicates that an ohmic contact is formed in these sensors (Fig. S3†).
To determine the sensing characteristics of the self-powered sensor to H2S, the open-circuit voltage–time (Voc–t) curve of the device under visible light illumination (λ = 600 nm, P = 1.8 mW cm−2) is obtained at zero bias. The micro-sensors were placed in a small transparent quartz chamber (the volume of the chamber is ∼0.4 mL) with an airscoop and airout, so the visible light can pass through the quartz and excite the device (Fig. S4†). The electrodes A and B are wire bonded to the ceramic dual in-line package (CERDIP) for electrical measurement. By diluting H2S gas with dry air via a mass flow controller (MFC), we can control the H2S gas concentration. Under a dry air atmosphere, the Voc reaches 181 mV under illumination (λ = 600 nm, P = 1.8 mW cm−2), which is shown in Fig. 2a. After exposing to H2S, the Voc of the device shows a sharp decrease and then reaches the steady state within 54 s. With the increase of H2S gas concentration, the Voc shows a decreasing trend, as shown in Fig. 2a. The detection limit is as low as 100 ppb. The sensitivity (S) of the photovoltaic self-power H2S sensor is defined as:

S = (|Vg − V0|)/V0, in which V0 and Vg are the values of Voc in dry air and the target gas under illumination, respectively.
 Fig. 2  (a, c, d) The response of the devices to different H2S concentrations based on SWNT/Si, SWNT-only, and n-Si-only sensors, respectively. The measurements are carried out at zero bias under light illumination (λ = 600 nm, P = 1.8 mW cm−2) to monitor the change of the open-circuit voltage (Voc). (b) The sensitivity of the device to different H2S concentrations under 600 nm light and its corresponding fitting curve (R2 = 0.996). 
However, when switched to the dark state, the sensor based on SWNT/Si showed no response to H2S (Fig. S5†). As shown in Fig. 2b, the sensitivity of the device has a linear relationship with the H2S concentration ranging from 100 ppb to 800 ppb (the linear correlation is 0.996). For comparison, the chemiresistive sensors based on SWNT-only and n-Si-only show negligible response to H2S under illumination at zero bias (Fig. 2c and d).
The difference among the three devices is because SWNTs can form p–n heterojunctions with n-Si, and then a strong enough BEF (∼0.55 eV) will be formed at the interface of p-SWNTs and n-Si due to the different work function of n-Si (∼4.25 eV) and p-SWNTs (∼4.8 eV).31–33 However, n-Si-only and SWNT-only form an ohmic contact with the electrodes (Fig. S3†). This means although sensors based on n-Si-only and SWNT-only can produce photogenerated hole–electron pairs under light illumination, the photogenerated holes cannot be separated from photogenerated electrons and cannot react with H2S owing to the lack of BEF. Therefore, electric signal changes of the devices based on n-Si-only and SWNT-only are difficult to detect. In addition, the sensitivity of the photovoltaic self-powered device shows 4.5 fold higher sensitivity to H2S (S = 2.23% for 400 ppb H2S) than that of the conventional H2S sensor based on SWNTs, which works under the bias of 2 V through measuring the resistance changes (S = 0.49% for 400 ppb H2S) (Fig. S6†). Due to the illumination, the number of holes in SWNTs reacting with H2S increases.13 Meanwhile, the response and recovery time of the photovoltaic self-powered sensor also are dramatically improved. The stability of the sensor based on SWNT/Si was also investigated by comparing the sensitivities of the as-prepared sensor and the sensor stored for 5 days. After five days, the sensitivity of the sensor to 200 ppb H2S decreases from 1.42% to 1.14% (Fig. S7†). Several publications also confirmed that the stability of the devices based on Si/carbon (including C60, CNT and graphene) needs to be optimized for their practical applications.34–36
The influence of the wavelength on the performance of the self-powered device was investigated (Fig. 3a). By applying the same power density of light and by varying the wavelength of light (420 nm and 600 nm), the sensitivity of the device decreases with the increase in the wavelength. According to Fig. 3a, the recovery time of the device is much shorter when illuminating under 600 nm than 420 nm. This may be caused by the charge redistribution in the H2S molecule owing to the molecular vibrations and electron transitions between the orbital energy levels when exposed to illumination. G. Vall-Llosera et al.37 found that there are many orbital energy levels existing in the H2S molecules by investigating the photo-fragment resonant S 2p excitations in H2S. As the existence of abundance energy levels, H2S can absorb photons ranging from 233 nm to 762 nm, especially in the 359 nm–532 nm range.37 Therefore, we deduced that when H2S is subjected to light in the range of 359 nm to 532 nm, such as 420 nm, the H2S will absorb the light and become more active and react with the photogenerated holes in the SWNT film. So it is too difficult to desorb from the surface of the device.
 Fig. 3  (a) The response sensitivity of the photovoltaic self-powered H2S sensor when applied under different wavelength light (420 nm and 600 nm) with the same power intensity (1.8 mW cm−2); (b, c) the schematic band diagram of the photovoltaic self-powered device in the dark and illumination state. In the dark, the band of SWNTs and n-Si will bend at the interface of these materials and stay in a balance state. After illumination, the balance will be broken and photoelectrons will be collected by n-Si, while photogenerated holes will be collected by SWNTs. 

Fig. 3b and c show the schematic band structure diagram of the device. SWNT is a narrow bandgap p-type semiconductor in air with a work function of around 4.8 eV.33 For n-Si with a phosphor dopant concentration of 1015–1016 cm−3, the band gap and work function of n-Si are about 1.12 eV and 4.05 eV, respectively, and the Fermi level is 0.2 eV below the conduction band.32,33 In the dark state, the device is kept in a thermal equilibrium state and a BEF at the interface of SWNTs and n-Si is formed, as shown in Fig. 3b. Once exposed to light with an energy above the band gap of SWNTs and n-Si, the balance state of the device will be changed due to the excited photogenerated carriers. After this, the BEF will work as a power source to separate the photogenerated carriers and drive them to n-Si (electrons) and SWNTs (holes), respectively, generating photocurrent as well as Voc in the circuit. The n-Si and SWNTs both act as e–h generators and also electron and hole collectors, respectively, which benefit the transportation of electrons and holes.25,27,28 When pumping into H2S, the H2S molecule absorbs on the surface of SWNTs and extracts the holes from SWNTs, which decreases the concentration of photogenerated holes in the SWNTs.
The electric current is defined as: I = Q/t = Nq/t(1)(Q refers to the electric charge per area, t refers to the time, N refers to the number of the electrons or holes, and q refers to the value of charge). The decrease in the concentration of holes which is caused by the absorbed H2S molecules will reduce the value of photogenerated current (IL).
On the other hand, the changing concentration of holes can also tune the value of Voc. According to the ideal p–n heterojunction solar diode equation, the Voc caused by the photoillumination can be obtained through the following formula:33 (2)where K is the Boltzmann constant, Is is the reverse saturation current and IL is the photogenerated current. Combined with eqn (1) and (2), the Voc closely relates the number of the carriers to the corresponding calculations and the following equation is obtained: (3)
As the value of Is is very small and usually can be regarded as a constant value, the decrease of holes will result in Voc dropping, which corresponds to the experimental results when the device is subjected to H2S and the value of Voc is decreased.
Conclusions
A photovoltaic self-powered H2S sensor based on an SWNT/Si heterojunction was successfully fabricated. Owing to the existing BEF which can transform photon energy into electrical energy, a self-powered sensor that detects trace H2S at room temperature was fabricated. In comparison with chemiresistive sensors based on SWNT-only, the sensitivity and response time of the self-powered sensor were much improved. The influence of the wavelength of light was investigated by applying different lights (e.g. 420 nm and 600 nm) with identical power densities. This work may bring a novel idea and a facile method to develop self-powered gas microsensors based on the rational p–n heterojunction design.

 	Fig. 2  (a, c, d) The response of the devices to different H2S concentrations based on SWNT/Si, SWNT-only, and n-Si-only sensors, respectively. The measurements are carried out at zero bias under light illumination (λ = 600 nm, P = 1.8 mW cm−2) to monitor the change of the open-circuit voltage (Voc). (b) The sensitivity of the device to different H2S concentrations under 600 nm light and its corresponding fitting curve (R2 = 0.996).	 

 	Fig. 3  (a) The response sensitivity of the photovoltaic self-powered H2S sensor when applied under different wavelength light (420 nm and 600 nm) with the same power intensity (1.8 mW cm−2); (b, c) the schematic band diagram of the photovoltaic self-powered device in the dark and illumination state. In the dark, the band of SWNTs and n-Si will bend at the interface of these materials and stay in a balance state. After illumination, the balance will be broken and photoelectrons will be collected by n-Si, while photogenerated holes will be collected by SWNTs.
