    , Accepted 3rd April 2022First published on 4th April 2022AbstractSmall-molecule organic solar cells (SMOSCs) have the advantage of good reproducibility with the low batch-to-batch variation of small-molecule materials, but they may have poor stability due to the unstable morphology of the all-small-molecule-based active layers. Introducing polymer acceptors into binary SMOSCs to construct novel ternary devices can be a good approach to alleviate the dilemma. Herein, a narrow bandgap small-molecule acceptor (SA), M36, is blended with a medium bandgap small-molecule donor (SD), BTR-F, to fabricate all small-molecule binary devices. After delicate optimization, the resulting best-performing SMOSC shows a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 10.14%. When a polymer acceptor (PA), N2200, is adopted as a third component (10 wt%) into the host blend system BTR-F:M36, SD/SA/PA-type ternary OSCs with enhanced performance are achieved. Incorporation of the small amount of polymer acceptor into the binary system can effectively improve the morphology of the resulting active layer thereby leading to an excellent PCE of 12.19% for the ternary device based on BTR-F:M36:N2200. More importantly, improved stability can be achieved for the ternary device compared with that for the BTR-F:M36-based binary device. These results indicate that the strategy of adding a small amount of polymer acceptor into binary small-molecule systems is promising to improve both the efficiency and stability of SMOSCs.
Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have great potential for renewable energy applications, owing to their advantages of semitransparency, mechanical flexibility, and solution processability.1–6 In recent years, benefiting from the emergence of many new non-fullerene acceptor materials and the rapid development of device engineering technology, the best power conversion efficiency (PCE) of OSCs has exceeded 18%.7,8 The active layer of binary OSCs is generally composed of a p-type organic semiconductor and an n-type organic semiconductor.9–12 Both polymer and small-molecule semiconductors can be used as donor or acceptor materials in the active layer. As shown in Fig. 1, for non-fullerene binary OSCs, there are four different types of bulk-heterojunctions according to the donor–acceptor combinations, i.e. (i) polymer donor/small-molecule acceptor (PD/SA-type), (ii) small-molecule donor/polymer acceptor (SD/PA-type), (iii) polymer donor/polymer acceptor (PD/PA-type), and (iv) small-molecule donor/small-molecule acceptor (SD/SA-type). Over the past few years, the PD/SA-type heterojunction has been dominating in the field of OSCs because the heterojunction can form interpenetrating networks readily.13–15 SD/SA-type small-molecule organic solar cells (SMOSCs) have also drawn enormous research interest due to the easy purification, defined chemical structures and therefore the less batch-to-batch variation of the small-molecule materials.16–30 Nevertheless, the unsuitable molecular stacking and crystallinity, and poor phase separation may lead to unbalanced charge mobility of SMOSCs therefore making their fill factor (FF) and short-circuit current density (JSC) values lower than those of PD/SA-type OSCs.16,17 Moreover, the relatively unstable morphology of the SMOSCs would also limit their practical application.

In the past few years, there were some important efforts in improving the morphology of the active layer for SMOSCs.18–20 For example, Wei et al. reported that by adjusting the branching points in alkyl terminal chains, an active layer with optimal morphology and appropriate molecular aggregation can be achieved which eventually led to BSCl-C2:IDIC-4Cl-based SMOSCs with an impressive PCE of 12.4%.21 Later, Zhu and co-workers demonstrated that the BSFTR:Y6-based SMOSCs sequentially treated by solvent vapor annealing and thermal annealing showed a significantly improved PCE of 13.69% in comparison with the PCE of 0.22% for the untreated SMOSCs. This improved device performance can be attributed to the higher mobilities and more suitable crystallinity of the annealed small-molecules.22 In addition to the use of new materials and novel device processing methods, the introduction of a third component to improve the morphology and light absorption of the active layer is also proven to be an effective method to enhance the performance of SMOSCs.23–25 For example, Lu et al. added PC71BM into the BTR-Cl:Y6-based active layer to afford a donor/acceptor phase with more reasonable domain size and favorable microstructures thereby leading to a PCE of 15.34% for the resulting best-performing device.26 An et al. designed and fabricated high-performance ternary SMOSCs by incorporating a small-molecule acceptor Y7 into the B1:BO-4Cl matrix. The best-performing ternary SMOSCs realized an excellent PCE of 16.28% due to the synergistically improved open-circuit voltage (VOC), JSC, and FF values in comparison with those for the binary devices.27 For the binary SMOSCs, it is very common to use a small-molecule acceptor as a third component to construct ternary devices. However, polymers are rarely used as a third component into the small-molecule host for efficient SMOSCs.28–30 Furthermore, less attention has been paid to the stability of ternary SMOSCs.
Recently, our group reported a high-performance A-D-A (acceptor–donor–acceptor)-type nonfullerene acceptor (M36) for polymer solar cells.31 Nonetheless, M36-based small-molecule solar cells have not been reported. Therefore, in this work, M36 was selected as an acceptor material to combine with the small-molecule donor BTR-F32 for fabricating SMOSCs. The optimized binary devices based on BTR-F:M36 exhibited a PCE of 10.14%. When a small amount of polymer acceptor N2200 (10 wt%, 1:1:0.1 of BTR-F:M36:N2200 in weight) was incorporated as the third component into the all small-molecule host, a new ternary blend (SD/SA/PA-type heterojunction) containing an SD, an SA and a PD was demonstrated for OSCs, for the first time (Fig. 1). Thanks to the suppressed crystallization and balanced charge mobilities, the optimized ternary device exhibited an improved PCE of 12.19% with a VOC of 0.894 V, a JSC of 21.29 mA cm−2 and a FF of 64.01%. Additionally, the introduction of the polymer N2200 not only led to SMOSCs with enhanced PCEs but also afforded the SMOSCs with significantly enhanced air stability without any encapsulation. The normalized PCE of the BTR-F:M36-based binary device degraded to 45.7% of its initial value after storage in air for 715 h, whereas, the BTR-F:M36:N2200-based ternary device retained 68.5% of its initial PCE under the same conditions. Our results provide a new ternary blend strategy to enhance both the efficiency and the stability of SMOSCs.
Results and discussion
Optical and electrochemical properties
The chemical structures and UV-vis absorption spectra of the small-molecule donor (BTR-F), small-molecule acceptor (M36) and polymer acceptor (N2200) are depicted in Fig. 2a and b, respectively. BTR-F shows a distinct absorption peak at 580 nm and an absorption edge at 698 nm. M36 possesses a narrow absorption band in the range of 700–900 nm, and N2200 shows two absorption peaks located at 396 and 709 nm, respectively. It can be apparently seen that the three materials have complementary absorption bands covering from the visible to NIR region. The UV-vis absorption spectra of the binary blend films based on BTR-F:M36, BTR-F:N2200 and the ternary blend film based on BTR-F:M36:N2200 (1:1:0.1 by weight) were further obtained and are displayed in Fig. S1.† As shown in the figure, the absorption intensity of the ternary blend is slightly enhanced compared with that of the BTR-F:M36-based binary blend implying that the device based on the ternary blend may deliver a higher JSC value in comparison with that for the corresponding binary device. Energy levels of the three materials in the active layer were determined by using cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements with Ag/Ag+ as a reference. As shown in Fig. 2c and S3,† the HOMO level of N2200 was lower than those of BTR-F and M36, while the LUMO level of N2200 was located in between those of BTR-F and M36. The LUMO/HOMO energy offsets between the donor and the acceptor (BTR-F/M36, BTR-F/N2200) are large enough to dissociate excitons at the D/A interfaces. At the same time, an enlarged VOC may be expected for the resulting device when N2200 with a higher-lying LUMO energy level was introduced into the BTR-F:M36-based binary device.

The photo-luminescence (PL) quenching measurement was carried out to study the charge transfer behavior between the donor and the acceptor. As shown in Fig. S2,† PL of the pristine BTR-F film was significantly quenched by M36 or N2200 when the film was excited at 580 nm, indicating the efficient charge transfer from the donor to the acceptors. Moreover, compared with the binary blend film based on BTR-F:M36 (99.4%) or BTR-F:N2200 (91.6%), the ternary blend film (BTR-F:M36:N2200, 1:1:0.1) showed more completely quenched emission (99.8%), suggesting the more efficient electron transfer in the ternary blend film. This phenomenon can be found similarly in the PL quenching measurement based on the M36-based films excited at 800 nm. It is worth noting that the PL intensity of the pristine M36 can also be quenched when a small amount of N2200 (10% by weight) was added, suggesting the efficient charge transfer in the M36:N2200 blend film (Fig. S4a†). To identify whether or not there is an incidental charge transfer between M36 and N2200, a series of OSCs with M36, N2200 or M36:N2200 (10:1, wt/wt) as active layers were fabricated and J–V curves of the OSCs were measured. As shown in Fig. S4b and Table S5,† the JSC value for the M36:N2200-based binary device was higher than those of the other two single-component devices, which reveals the occurrence of exciton dissociation at the interface of M36 and N2200.
Photovoltaic performance
The OSCs were fabricated with a conventional device structure of glass/indium-tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly-(4-styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/active layer/2,9-bis(3-(dimethylamino)propyl)anthrax[2,1,9-def:6,5,10-d′e′f′]diisoquinoline-1,3,8,10(2H,9H)tetraone (PDIN)/Ag to evaluate the photovoltaic performance of different active layers. The active layers were optimized by varying the weight ratio of the donor and the acceptor, as well as by using solvent vapor annealing and thermal annealing (TA) treatments. The best processing conditions for the active layer are solvent vapor annealing treatment for 40 s and TA at 105 °C for 5 min later. The annealing treatments could efficiently improve the performance of BTR-F:M36-based binary device, as well as the ternary device based on BTR-F:M36:N2200. The detailed device parameters for the devices under various optimization conditions are collected in Tables 1, S1 and S2.† The current density–voltage (J–V) curves for the best-performing devices are depicted in Fig. 3a. The binary device based on BTR-F:M36 without post-treatment showed a low PCE of 1.44%. With the optimized processing, the best-performing binary device exhibited a PCE of 10.14% with a JSC of 20.01 mA cm−2, and a FF of 56.83%. Impressively, with the introduction of the10 wt% polymer acceptor N2200 into the all small-molecule host blend BTR-F:M36, the ternary device based on BTR-F:M36:N2200 exhibited a higher PCE of 12.19%. In comparison with the binary device based on BTR-F:M36 (FF = 56.83%), a higher FF of 64.01% was also achieved for the ternary device based on BTR-F:M36:N2200, which could be ascribed to the more balanced charge transport property. It should be noted that a much lower PCE of 0.82% was found for the binary device based on BTR-F:N2200. Poor active layer morphology was found for the BTR-F:N2200 binary blend. However, in the ternary blend, N2200 could act as a regulator to optimize the active layer morphology. Moreover, both higher JSC and VOC values (21.29 mA cm−2 and 0.894 V) were observed for the BTR-F:M36:N2200-based ternary device. The higher JSC value could be attributed to the enhanced absorption intensity of the ternary blend film (BTR-F:M36:N2200) as shown in the previous section, and the larger VOC value could have resulted from the incorporation of N2200 with a high-lying LUMO energy level. In order to know the effect of the molecular weight of N2200 on the performance of ternary devices, three different batches of N2200 were used as the third component. As shown in Table S3,† the performances of ternary devices are barely affected by the molecular weight of N2200 demonstrating the good reproducibility of the SD/SA/PA-type ternary OSCs.

The performance of ternary devices was further investigated using N2200 with varied weight ratios. As shown in Fig. S5a and Table S4,† when 20% of N2200 was introduced, the JSC of the ternary device decreased from 21.29 mA cm−2 to 20.46 mA cm−2, resulting in a relatively lower PCE of 11.71%. Nevertheless, the PCE of the ternary device based on BTR-F:M36:N2200 (1:1:0.2) is still higher than that of the binary device based on BTR-F:M36, due to the comparable FF value. When the content of N2200 in the ternary system was further increased, the PCE of the ternary device decreased indicating the adverse effect of the excessive N2200 on the phase morphology.
The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the best-performing devices are shown in Fig. 3b and S5b.† As demonstrated, the integral JSC values calculated from the corresponding EQE spectra for the BTR-F:M36-based binary, the BTR-F:M36:N2200-based ternary and the BTR-F:N2200-based binary devices were 19.48, 20.78 and 1.50 mA cm−2, respectively. Obviously, these calculated values are consistent with the JSC values from the J–V measurements within 5% mismatches. Compared with the binary device based on BTR-F:M36, the optimized ternary device based on BTR-F:M36:N2200 (1:1:0.1) exhibits a higher and flatter EQE spectrum in the region of 500–800 nm, which could be related to the enhanced absorption of the ternary active layer with N2200. These results suggest that the incorporation of N2200 could efficiently enhance the photo-response of the BTR-F:M36:N2200-based device thereby leading to its higher JSC value. To study the device repeatability of the M36-based binary and ternary devices, 12 individual devices were fabricated to provide the PCE statistical box plots. As displayed in Fig. 3c, both the binary and ternary devices showed good reproducibility with small PCE deviations.
Charge separation, transport and recombination
In order to explore the influence of the N2200 incorporation on the exciton dissociation property of the devices, the curves of photocurrent density (Jph) versus the efficient voltage (Veff) for the binary and ternary devices were plotted. Jph is defined as Jph = JL − JD, where JL is the current density under light illumination and JD is the dark current density.33Veff was determined by using the equation Veff = V0 − Vbias, where V0 is the voltage at which Jph = 0 and Vbias is the applied bias voltage. It is generally believed that all the hole–electron pairs are completely dissociated when the Jph reaches saturation (Jsat) at a large reverse bias. Therefore, the P(E,T) value was evaluated by measuring the Jsat and Veff for the binary and ternary devices. As shown in Fig. 3d, the calculated P(E,T) values are 89.2%, 95.3% and 11.9% for the BTR-F:M36-based binary, the BTR-F:M36:N2200-based ternary and the BTR-F:N2200-based binary devices, respectively. Generally, a higher value of P(E,T) indicates more efficient exciton dissociation and charge extraction rates. In comparison with the binary device based on BTR-F:M36 and the binary device based on BTR-F:N2200, a significantly higher P(E,T) value was obtained for the ternary device based on BTR-F:M36:N2200, which is consistent with its higher JSC value.
The dependence of JSC on light intensity (Plight) as well as the dependence of VOC on Plight was measured to further study the charge recombination dynamics in the devices. The curves of VOCversus lnPlight of the two binary devices and the ternary device are plotted in Fig. 3e. The obtained power law relationship between VOC and Plight can be described as: VOC ∝ lnPlight. When the bimolecular recombination is the dominant mechanism and the trap-assisted recombination is low, the slope of VOCversus lnPlight should be close to 1 × kT/q (k is Boltzmann's constant, T is the temperature, and q is the elementary charge). However, a slope of 2 × kT/q implies that the trap-assisted recombination is the main mechanism in the active layer.34,35 From the VOC–Plight plots, one can find that all slopes of the devices are close to 1, demonstrating that the bimolecular recombination should be the dominant mechanism in all the devices. Moreover, compared with the binary device based on BTR-F:M36 with a slope of 1.21 kT/q, a lower slope of 1.14 kT/q was attained for the BTR-F:M36:N2200-based ternary device, which is closer to 1. These results indicate that the trap-assisted recombination could be suppressed by the incorporation of the polymer acceptor N2200. The relationship between JSC and Plight can be defined as JSC ∝ Plightα, where α value should be equal to 1 in case that all the charge carriers are swept out before charge recombination.36 As described in Fig. 3f, α values for the BTR-F:M36-based binary, the BTR-F:M36:N2200-based ternary and the BTR-F:N2200-based binary devices are 0.836, 0.843 and 0.624, respectively. The increased α value with the incorporation of N2200 indicates that the free carriers of the resulting devices were efficiently collected by the electrodes instead of being recombined.
Next, the charge transfer properties of the binary and ternary devices were measured through the space charge limited current (SCLC) method. The hole mobility (μh) was obtained from the hole-only device with the structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS (40 nm)/active layer (120 nm)/MoO3 (10 nm)/Ag (100 nm). And the electron-only device with the structure of ITO/ZnO (30 nm)/active layer (115 nm)/Ca (20 nm)/Al (100 nm) was prepared to estimate the electron mobility (μe). As described in Fig. S6a and S6b,† the BTR-F:M36-based binary device showed a μh of 4.29 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and a μe of 1.79 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, which are apparently higher than those of the BTR-F:N2200-based binary devices (μh = 2.64 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, μe = 9.05 × 10−7 cm2 V−1 s−1). The enhanced and more balanced charge transport is beneficial for achieving the higher JSC of the BTR-F:M36-based binary OSCs. Upon the incorporation of N2200, the ternary active layer exhibited a slightly increased μh of 1.12 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, a decreased μe of 2.98 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, and a μh:μe ratio of 3.76. Generally, the charge transport properties of active layers are affected by the phase separation and the molecular orientation. Although the introduction of N2200 in the BTR-F:M36 has a negative effect on improving the electron mobility of the active layer, its more balanced μh:μe ratio ensures the higher FF and PCE values of the resulting ternary device.

Active layer morphology. 
To gain an in-depth insight into the morphology of blend films, atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements were performed at first. As shown in Fig. 4, the BTR-F:M36 blend film exhibits an obvious fibrillar structure with a smooth surface with a root-mean-square (RMS) value of 0.519 nm, which is favorable for the efficient charge transport. After the incorporation of N2200 into the BTR-F:M36 blend, the fibril-like morphology could be still clearly observed, but a slightly larger RMS value of 0.854 nm was obtained. Apart from the phase separation morphology of the active layer, the molecular orientation and crystallinity behavior of active layer materials also play an important role in determining the performance of OSCs. Herein, grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements were carried out and the diffraction pattern as well as the line-cut profile of the neat BTR-F film is depicted in Fig. S7.† One can clearly find the lamellar packing diffraction (100), (200) and (300) peaks in the out-of-plane direction and the π–π stacking (010) peak in the in-plane direction, implying that the neat BTR-F film prefers to adapt an edge-on molecular orientation. Moreover, the pure M36 film has a face-on orientation with the (010) diffraction peak at 1.82 Å−1 in the out-of-plane direction and (100) diffraction peak at 0.32 Å−1 in the in-plane direction.31 Interestingly, as shown in Fig. 5 and Table S6,† the face-on orientation is dominant in the BTR-F:M36 blend film, which could facilitate the charge transport and therefore an OSC with improved performance. The face-on π–π stacking peaks of the binary BTR-F:M36 blend film and the ternary BTR-F:M36:N2200 blend film were located at 1.70 and 1.72 Å−1 with corresponding crystal coherence lengths (CCLs) of 41.26 and 24.26 Å, respectively. The smaller d-spacing could facilitate the intermolecular charge transport and suppress the charge recombination in spite of the decreased CCL value. It is the reason for the higher JSC and FF values obtained from the BTR-F:M36:N2200-based ternary device compared with those from the BTR-F:M36-based binary device.

Furthermore, the water contact angle (WCA) experiments of the BTR-F:M36-based binary blend film and the BTR-F:M36:N2200-based ternary blend film were utilized to explore the impact of N2200 on the surface property of the active layer. As shown in Fig. S8,† the WCA value of the BTR-F:M36:N2200-based ternary blend film is 108.8°, which is higher than that of the BTR-F:M36-based binary blend film (102.6°). Moreover, when the water was placed on the surfaces of the active layers for 15 seconds, the WCA values of BTR-F:M36:N2200-based ternary blend film and BTR-F:M36-based binary blend film were 107.4° and 66.1°, respectively. With the increasing time, the WCA value of BTR-F:M36-based binary film decreased to 39.4° gradually, while that of BTR-F:M36:N2200-based ternary film hardly changed (WCA = 107.1°). The rapidly changed WCA value of the binary blend film can be attributed to the deformation of the surface structure of the all small-molecule substrate.37,38 These results suggest that the introduction of N2200 can efficiently elevate the hydrophobicity of the active layer surface thereby leading to improved air stability of the resulting device.

Storage stability and photo stability
It is well known that excellent device stability is also an important characteristic for high-performance OSCs. Encouraged by the enhanced intermolecular interaction and increased hydrophobicity in the ternary blend with 10% N2200, we further evaluated the influence of N2200 on the air stability and light stability of the device. As shown in Fig. 6a and b, the optimized binary device based on BTR-F:M36 only maintained 45.7% of its initial PCE after being stored in air without any encapsulation for 715 h at 40–70% relative humidity (RH) and room temperature. Remarkably, the ternary device based on BTR-F:M36:N2200 retained a higher initial PCE of 68.5% under the same conditions which can be attributed to the improved active layer morphology and the increased hydrophobicity of the ternary active layer in comparison with the binary active layer. In detail, the VOC, JSC and FF values of the BTR-F:M36:N2200-based ternary device retained 82.3%, 100.8% and 82.2% of the corresponding initial values, respectively, which are higher than those of the binary device based on BTR-F:M36 (70.4% of initial VOC, 87.8% of initial JSC and 72.9% of initial FF). It should be noted that the JSC value of the ternary device barely changed which can be attributed to the fact that the introduction of N2200 improves the morphology stability of the active layer in air. It should be noted that for both the binary and ternary devices, there is a rapid exponential decay at the early stage which could be related to the diffusion of oxygen and water into the unencapsulated devices. The phenomenon has been observed similarly by others.39

At the same time, the ternary device also showed better photo-stability than the binary device based on BTR-F:M36 because of the incorporation of N2200. The binary and ternary devices were measured after the continuous light illumination (intensity of 100 mW cm−2) for 120 min to investigate the photoinduced stability. As depicted in Fig. 6c and d, the PCE of the ternary device based on BTR-F:M36:N2200 decayed to 65.9% of its initial value, whereas, the binary device based on BTR-F:M36 could only retain 59.7% of its initial value due to a significant JSC loss. These results further indicate the positive effect of the N2200 incorporation on improving the air stability and light stability of the ternary device.
Conclusions
To conclude, a new class of SD/SA/PA-type ternary devices has been fabricated by incorporating a polymer acceptor, N2200 (10 wt%), into the BTR-F:M36-based all small-molecule host system. As a third component, the small amount of polymer acceptor is an excellent morphology regulator to optimize the active layer micro-structures, to shorten the intermolecular π–π stacking distance, and to increase the hydrophobicity of the active layer surface. The favorable morphology of the ternary blend can balance the hole and electron transport thereby leading to efficient charge collection and suppressed charge recombination. As a result, the ternary device based on BTR-F:M36:N2200 delivered a PCE of 12.19% with a VOC of 0.894 V, a JSC of 21.29 mA cm−2, and a FF of 64.01%. The PCE of the ternary device is higher than that of the binary counterpart (10.14% PCE). Notably, the impact of the batch-to-batch variation of the polymer acceptor N2200 on the photovoltaic performance of the ternary devices was almost negligible. In addition, the ternary device exhibited better storage stability in ambient air as well as improved photo-stability compared with the binary device based on BTR-F:M36. Our results demonstrate that introducing a small amount of polymer acceptor into all small-molecule blend systems is a promising strategy to improve both PCE and stability of SMOSCs.
