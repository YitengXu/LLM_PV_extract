    , Accepted 26th January 2009First published on 11th February 2009AbstractBODIPY derivatives have been used as donor in solution-processed bulk heterojunction solar cells using PCBM as acceptor. A power conversion efficiency of 1.34% has been obtained under simulated solar irradiation.
Bulk heterojunction solar cells (BHJ) are attracting considerable current interest based on the idea of fabricating large area, low weight and flexible energy sources by means of simple cost-effective and environmentally friendly technologies.1 Recently, power conversion efficiencies of ∼5% have been reported for organic solar cells based on interpenetrated networks of a soluble fullerene derivative [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM)2 and regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) P3HT.3 In spite of these performance levels, P3HT poses a number of problems related to its relatively large band gap and low absorption coefficient. Furthermore, the preparation of highly regioregular P3HT with controlled molecular weight, polydispersity and purity is far from trivial.4 In this context, an alternative approach based on the use of solution processable small conjugated molecules as donor has recently emerged.5 In fact, molecular donors present some specific advantages in terms of structural definition and reproducibility of the synthesis and purification. In the past few years BHJ based on various molecular donors have been reported, including triphenylamine derivatives with internal charge-transfer,6 tetrahedral conjugated architectures,7 dendritic oligothiophenes,8 anthracenic structures,9 fluorenone derivatives10 or merocyanine dyes with high molecular extinction coefficients11 and power conversion efficiencies up to 1.70% have been reported quite recently.8c,11
  
Derivatives of borondipyrromethene (BODIPY®) form an important class of fluorescent dyes that have attracted considerable interest in recent years owing to a unique combination of facile synthesis, stability and outstanding optical properties.12 On the other hand, the presence of a tetrahedral boron atom in the BODIPY structure makes it an interesting starting node for the synthesis of 3D-conjugated structures as active materials for organic (opto)electronic devices and solar cells.5 While TiO2dye-sensitized solar cells involving BODIPY derivatives have been reported,13 the potential of this class of conjugated systems  in organic solar cells has not been investigated yet. As the first step of a project aiming at the development of new series of BODIPY derivatives as donor material for organic solar cells, we report here preliminary results on BHJ solar cells based on compounds 1 and 2 as donors and PCBM as acceptor.
The highly colored dyes1 and 2 were synthesized in two steps from the 8-(4-iodophenyl)-1,3,5,7-tetramethyl-4,4-difluoro-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene.14 A Knoevenagel type condensation with p-methoxyethoxyethoxybenzaldehyde in presence of piperidine provides the mono and distyryl F-BODIPY derivatives conveniently separated thanks to the presence of polar groups.15 The fluoride atoms were then replaced by two 4,7-dioxaoct-1-yne groups by use of the corresponding ethynyl-Grignard in THF leading to E-BODIPY.16 The introduction of one and two styryl units in the structure allows extension of the π-conjugated system and thus reduction of the HOMO–LUMO gap while the oligo-oxyethylene chains ensure chemical stability, good solubility and film-forming properties of the molecules.

Table 1 lists the main optical and electrochemical data for compounds 1 and 2. The UV-Vis spectra show two absorption bands with maxima at 340 and 572 nm for 1 and 370 and 646 nm for 2, respectively (Table 1 and ESI† ). Both compounds present high molecular extinction coefficients and high photoluminescence quantum yields. Cyclic voltammetry was performed in methylene chloride in the presence of Bu4NPF6 as supporting electrolyte. Both compounds are reversibly oxidized around 0.60–0.75 V. As expected, the more extensively conjugated compound 2 has a lower oxidation potential. The two compounds are reversibly reduced in the −1.20 to −1.30 V region. UV-Vis absorption spectra and CV data lead to consistent values of the HOMO–LUMO gap ΔE of ca. 2.00 and 1.80 eV for 1 and 2, respectively. The UV-Vis spectra of thin films spin-cast on ITO-glass pre-treated with PEDOT–PSS reveal a slight broadening of the absorption bands and a red shift of the maxima to 588 and 675 nm attributed to intermolecular interactions (Fig. 1). The absorption onset leads to estimated values of the band gap (Eg) of 1.95 and 1.70 eV for 1 and 2, respectively.

Bulk heterojunction solar cells were realized by spin-coating chloroform solutions of compounds 1 and 2 4.9 and 4.1 mg ml−1 and (PCBM) in a 1 : 2 weight ratio on ITO-coated glass substrates treated with a 40 nm thick spin-cast layer of PEDOT–PSS film (Baytron PH 500) (see ESI† ).

Fig. 2 shows the incident photon conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the two types of devices under monochromatic irradiation. In both cases the IPCE spectrum mimics the UV-Vis absorption spectrum. The action spectrum of the cell based on compound 1 shows a first peak of 27% around 450 nm, which can be attributed to the convolution of the contribution of PCBM* with the first absorption band of compound 1. This band is followed by a more intense peak of 45% at ca. 570 nm. The IPCE spectrum of compound 2 shows an intense first peak of ∼40% at 400 nm and a peak of 32% around 680 nm corresponding to the main absorption band. For both donors, the width of the IPCE active bands is limited to ca. 150 nm, in agreement with the narrow absorption bands of the donors.

Fig. 3 shows the current density (J) vs. voltage (V) characteristics of a cell based on 2 in the dark and under simulated solar illumination in AM 1.5 conditions with an incident power light of 100 mW cm−2. The J–V curve recorded in the dark shows a clear rectification behavior and the device allows large forward currents (e.g. 22 mA cm−2 at +1.5 V).

As shown in Table 2, both devices give short-circuit current densities (Jsc) exceeding 4.0 mA cm−2 (Table 2). The cell based on donor 1 delivers an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.796 V, combined with a filling factor (FF) of 34%, and these results lead to a power conversion efficiency (η) of 1.17%. The J–V curve of the cell based on donor 2 exhibits a lower Voc of 0.753 V, in agreement with the higher HOMO  level of compound 217 (Table 1). The characteristic of this cell presents an improved FF value of 44%, which is relatively high for a BJH cell based on a small molecule and suggests that the more extended π-conjugated structure of compound 2 leads to better hole-transport properties and/or better charge collection at the electrodes. However, this hypothesis needs to be confirmed.

The cell gives a power conversion efficiency of 1.34%, a value which ranks among the highest reported so far for BHJ solar cells based on solution-processed molecular donors.5–11
To summarize, BODIPY derivatives with extended conjugation have been synthesized and used as donor materials in organic solar cells. These new donors present an interesting combination of high absorption coefficient, appropriate energy levels and processability from common organic solvents. Preliminary results obtained on solar cells with PCBM as acceptor showed power conversion efficiencies among the highest reported so far for BHJ solar cells based on solution-processed small molecules. Reaching such performances with molecules with a relatively narrow absorption spectral range suggests that this class of conjugated systems has a high potential for progress and represents a particularly interesting platform for the molecular engineering of processable molecular donors for organic solar cells. Work aiming at the design of new BODIPY derivatives with optimized light-harvesting and hole-transport properties is now underway and will be reported in future publications.
