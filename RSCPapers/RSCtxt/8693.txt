    , Accepted 1st March 2023First published on 1st March 2023AbstractTo facilitate the potential applications of organic solar cells (OSCs), the highly cost-effective processing fabrication of solar cells and modules is an important prerequisite. However, process development has received little attention and is rarely reported. Herein, we propose a polymeric self-doping strategy to fabricate high-performance bulk-heterojunction (BHJ)-type active layers with super-fast blade-coating speeds. We found that doping a small amount of PM6 with a relatively low molecular weight (namely PM6L) into the PM6:Y6 system can remarkably improve the high-speed processability of the active layer without sacrificing its photovoltaic performance, supported by relevant morphological and physical measurements. The in situ analysis further illustrates the effects of PM6L-doping on the molecular aggregation behaviors during the film-forming process at low and high blade-coating speeds. The universality of this PM6L-doping strategy was confirmed in three other PM6-based BHJ-type OSCs. Importantly, the high-speed manufacturing of large-scale solar modules and their techno-economic analysis further highlight the merits of this strategy, thus driving the commercialization of the OSC technique forward.

Broader context
The coating speeds of the reported active layer systems fabricated by roll-to-roll-available processing technologies (like doctor-blade (DB) coating and slot-die coating), which were routinely coated at linear speeds of 0.3–1.5 m min−1, are far behind the printing processes of relevant interfacial layers and metal electrodes (>10 m min−1). The inferior linear speeds for active layer fabrication inevitably limit the production capacity of the entire production line, thus resulting in a remarkable increase in the manufacturing minimum sustainable price (MSP) of industrial-scale organic photovoltaics (OPVs). Based on this view, a high coating speed (or high throughput) should be also used to judge the commercial feasibility of OPV modules. Herein, we reported a polymeric micro-doping strategy to facilitate high-speed fabrication of the active layer while maintaining its favorable device performance. Further techno-economic analysis manifests that this method can lead to MSP reductions. Overall, current efforts provide an important way to extend the current success of OPVs into commercial applications.

1. Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) based on a bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) architecture, consisting of mixed donor (D) and acceptor (A) materials, have received much attention in recent decades, owing to their advantages of intrinsic flexibility, low-cost, solution processability and semitransparency.1–6 So far, the non-fullerene acceptor (NFA)-based OSCs deliver promising power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) with over 19%,7–11 drawing on the rapid improvement of materials design, morphology control, interface, and device engineering.12–17 Notably, although many aspects, including internal factors, external conditions and synergistic stresses, etc.,18–20 influence the BHJ morphology degradation behaviors of OSCs,21 recent improvements in operational and thermal stability issues have been greatly facilitated by various approaches, such as solvent and solid additives, non-fused NFAs, cross-linkable polymers and so on.22–26 Of particular note is that many NFA-based active layer systems with high device performance and low synthesis cost (or low synthetic complexity) are also widely developed.6,10,21,27,28 Based on these visible developments in the OSC filed in terms of device efficiency, operation stability, and materials cost, it can be seen that scalable manufacturing issues (including, eco-friendly processability of function layers, scaling lag of device efficiency, high-speed coating capability, and encapsulation techniques),13,29,30 which also determine the commercialization of OSCs, are becoming more prominent.
Generally, scalable manufacturing issues of the OSC systems include the eco-friendly coating capability of active layer materials, selectivity of coating techniques, and high-speed process-ability of active layer morphology. Halogenated solvents (like chloroform and chlorobenzene) and spin-coating techniques, used for fabricating OSCs,16,31 are inappropriate for large-scale manufacturing owing to the inherent disadvantages to human health, environmental concerns, and substrate size constraints, etc.32 Recent improvements in large-scale device fabrications by using green solvents and printing available technologies (e.g. doctor-blade (DB) coating, slot-die coating, and screen printing) have been greatly facilitated.30,33 These attempts and progresses have also significantly driven the application of OSCs forward.33,34 It should be noted that OSC technology is considered to be a low-cost renewable energy photovoltaic technology because of its ability to perform solution processing at extremely high printing linear speeds, with significant advantages in terms of high throughput and low energy consumption. However, the roll-to-roll (R2R)-available coating technologies with high throughput are only theoretically considered for use in large-scale fabrication of OSCs.35,36 Meanwhile, research on developing the high-speed manufacturing of OSCs without sacrificing their photovoltaic performance is relatively rare.37–39 Note that the linear coating speeds (about 0.3–1.5 m min−1) for fabricating the active layer systems reported so far significantly lag behind the coating speeds of relevant interfacial layers and metal electrodes (>10–20 m min−1).30,32,40,43–47 Impressively, we recently demonstrated the high-speed processability of pseudo-bilayer-type active layers via a sequential deposition technology.13 This high-speed coating approach can be applied to effectively blade various NFA-based systems, and can also be applied to various R2R-available coating techniques to fabricate OSCs while maintaining device performance. On the contrary, the BHJ active layers formed by the D:A mixed solutions exhibited huge performance losses of OSCs fabricated at high coating speeds.
Thus, transforming BHJ OSC systems from their D:A mixed solutions into large-scale active layers with a suitable bulk microstructure, high photovoltaic performance, and high throughput is a crucial challenge. It is because the low linear printing speed limits the factory throughput of the entire production line, and thus inevitably results in a significant increment in the minimum sustainable price (MSP).1,41,42 Thus, a high throughput factor (or high coating speed) should also be used to evaluate the application potentials of active layer materials, as well as the so-called golden triangle elements (efficiency, stability, and synthesis cost).43,44 Specifically, previous reports show that the device efficiencies dropped dramatically as the blade-coating speed of the BHJ active layer systems (including PM6:Y6, PM6:T8, and PTQ10:Y6, etc.) generally increased.13 Based on the reported results, developing high-speed coating approaches of relevant BHJ active layers without sacrificing their device performance is crucial and urgent, especially under the background of the practical transition from lab-scale research to the exploration and pilot testing of large-scale BHJ solar modules.
Previous reports demonstrated that relevant doping approaches (like solid additives) and multi-component blending strategies can effectively modulate the blend morphologies during the film formation, thus facilitating the improvement in device performance. Herein, we used a blade-coating technique as the R2R-compatible processing technique to investigate the high-speed processability of the PM6:Y6 system taken as an example and fabricated at various blade-coating speeds. Impressively, we demonstrated that delicately introducing a small amount of PM6 with a low molecular weight (namely PM6L) into the widely used PM6:Y6 system can realize its high coating-speed process while maintaining its high device efficiency. The effects of PM6L-doping on the film formation behaviors and blend morphological characteristics were investigated in detail. Moreover, the universality of this self-doping strategy was further demonstrated by introducing three other NFA-based systems and fabricating large-scale PM6:Y6 solar modules. Importantly, the cost-benefit analysis in an industrial scenario highlights the merits of this PM6L-doping approach for reducing scalable manufacturing costs.
2. Results and discussion

Fig. 1A exhibits the molecular structures of PM6 and Y6 investigated in this work. As shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†), the number-average molecular weight (Mn) and polydispersity index values of the PM6 batches were measured to be 45.4 kg mol−1 and 2.15 for PM6, and 17.1 kg mol−1 and 2.55 for PM6L, respectively. Note that PM6L was used as the doping component. Relevant absorption spectra of the active layer materials in the solid state are depicted in Fig. S2 (ESI†). The corresponding optical parameters are presented in Table S1 in the ESI.† Although PM6 and PM6L show similar optical bandgaps of approximately 1.83 eV, the vibronic 0–0 peak of PM6 with a higher absorption coefficient is stronger than that of PM6L, indicating their differentiated molecular aggregation strengths.45

As exhibited in Fig. 1B, the control PM6:Y6 devices fabricated by a DB coating technology delivered optimized device efficiency when the blade-coating speed was 2.3 m min−1 and the D:A weight ratio was 1:1.2 in chloroform solution. Relevant J–V curves of the PM6:Y6 devices fabricated at various blade-coating speeds are exhibited in Fig. S3 (ESI†) and their photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table S2 (ESI†). The optimal PM6:Y6 system without any additives and post-treatments showed a PCE of 15.67%, along with a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 25.30 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.838 V and a fill factor (FF) of 73.94% (Table 1). Furthermore, we introduced a small amount of PM6L to modulate the bulk microstructure of the PM6:Y6 BHJ system (Fig. S4 and Table S3, ESI†). Consequently, after adding 5 wt% of PM6L (all wt% in the article are relative to the amount of PM6 and Y6) into the host PM6:Y6 system, the PM6L-doped devices delivered a slightly higher efficiency of 15.84% (Jsc = 25.67 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.833 V, FF = 74.04%).

As mentioned above, high-throughput preparation of the active layer without sacrificing device performance is a great challenge.42,43 We found that adding 5 wt% of PM6L into the PM6:Y6 system can effectively suppress the influence of high-speed processing on device efficiency, as presented in Fig. 1C (extracted from Fig. S5, S6, and Tables S4, S5, ESI†). Note that blend thickness along with BHJ morphology and device efficiency can be fine-tuned by changing the solution concentration and blade-coating speed. As the coating-speed increases, the device efficiencies of the normal PM6:Y6 system fabricated by various solution concentrations decrease obviously (Fig. 1C), even though their blend thicknesses are comparable. On the contrary, the PM6L-doped PM6:Y6 system fabricated at various blade-coating speeds exhibited optimized PCEs of over 15.5%. The degradation behaviors of the PM6:Y6 devices without and with PM6L-doping, fabricated at low and high blade-coating speeds (Fig. S7, ESI†), were also investigated. Specifically, the PM6L-doped PM6:Y6 devices showed slightly better operational stability as compared to the un-doped PM6:Y6 devices. These results illustrate that this PM6L-doping approach effectively keeps off the device performance loss of the active layer under high-speed coating conditions.
To investigate the effects of PM6L-doping on the blend morphology and device physics, the related active layer morphologies fabricated at different blade-coating speeds (including 2.3, 5.3, and 30.0 m min−1 for PM6:Y6, and 2.2, 5.1, and 30.0 m min−1 for PM6:Y6 doped by 5 wt% of PM6L) were observed using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As shown in Fig. 2A, the root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of the relevant active layers are 0.94 (0.94 ± 0.01) nm for 2.3 m min−1, 1.09 (1.09 ± 0.01) nm for 5.3 m min−1, and 1.61 (1.61 ± 0.03) nm for 30.0 m min−1, respectively. Clearly from the AFM images, the surface morphology of the PM6:Y6 active layers fabricated at high coating speeds was found to contain large domain features, also supported by the TEM images, which led to more severe carrier recombination and poorer charge transport properties. Impressively, the PM6L-doped PM6:Y6 active layers fabricated at low and high blading speeds exhibit comparable blend morphologies (RMS roughness of 1.14 (1.14 ± 0.01), 1.27 (1.27 ± 0.02) and 1.28 (1.28 ± 0.02) nm for 2.2, 5.1, and 30.0 m min−1, respectively), as presented in Fig. 2B. These results suggest that this PM6L-doping strategy effectively suppresses the formation of large domains during the film formation processes, which are also demonstrated by the absorption spectra measurements (Fig. S8, ESI†). In addition, we conducted grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements to get a deep insight into the crystallinity characteristics of the PM6L-doped and dopant-free active layers fabricated at low and high coating speeds. As depicted in Fig. S13 (ESI†) and summarized in Table S6 (ESI†), it can be seen that all films adopt a preferential face-on orientation relative to the substrates. In addition, the crystallinity of the dopant-free PM6:Y6 blend fabricated at 30 m min−1 decreased faster, as compared with the same system fabricated at low coating speeds, showing prominent (010) diffraction peaks located at qz = 1.707 Å−1 for the dopant-free PM6:Y6 fabricated at 2.3 m min−1, qz = 1.709 Å−1 for the dopant-free PM6:Y6 fabricated at 30.0 m min−1 and qz = 1.710 Å−1 for the PM6L-doped PM6:Y6 blend fabricated at 30.0 m min−1 in the out-of-plane (OOP) direction, respectively. Furthermore, we quantitatively analyzed the crystal coherence length (CCL) values using the full width at half-maximum of the OOP (010) peak, which are 23.70 Å for the dopant-free PM6:Y6 fabricated at 2.3 m min−1, 14.20 Å for the dopant-free PM6:Y6 fabricated at 30.0 m min−1, and 22.35 Å for the PM6L-doped PM6:Y6 blend fabricated at 30.0 m min−1, respectively. These results suggest that the PM6:Y6 binary system doped by 5 wt% of PM6L can keep the crystallinity of the molecules during the process of active layer fabrication.46,47

(C and D) Carrier mobilities of the dopant-free and PM6L-doped devices, calculated by photo-CELIV, TPV and TPC measurements of the corresponding devices. 
A photo-induced charge carrier extraction by linearly increasing the voltage (photo-CELIV) technique was used to probe the carrier mobilities in the corresponding devices (Fig. S9, ESI†). As the coating-speed increases from 2.3 to 30.0 m min−1, the carrier mobility of PM6:Y6 undergoes a monotonic reduction, as shown in Fig. 2C and D. On the contrary, the carrier mobilities of the PM6L-doped devices are comparable: 1.12 × 10−4, 1.10 × 10−4, and 1.00 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for 2.2, 5.1, and 30.0 m min−1, respectively. Moreover, a transient photovoltage (TPV) technique was used to analyze the recombination mechanisms (extracted from Fig. S10, ESI†). The carrier lifetimes were evaluated to be 6.26 μs for 2.3 m min−1, 4.44 μs for 5.3 m min−1, and 3.18 μs for 30.0 m min−1, respectively, indicating the more severe carrier recombination losses of the PM6:Y6 devices fabricated at high-speed blading conditions, which were also supported by the J–V curves under various light intensities (Fig. S11, ESI†). The PM6L-doped devices in contrast showed comparable carrier lifetime values (7.94, 8.27, and 8.05 μs for 2.2, 5.1, and 30.0 m min−1, respectively). Besides, as compared with the dopant-free devices (0.42, 0.45, and 0.63 μs for 2.3, 5.3, and 30.0 m min−1, respectively, Fig. 2C), the PM6L-doped PM6:Y6 devices delivered lower charge extraction times (0.28, 0.29, and 0.32 μs for 2.2, 5.1, and 30.0 m min−1, respectively, Fig. 2D). Overall, these physical findings, to a certain extent, confirm the effect of coating speed on the morphology of the active layer, which leads to the difference in PCE, further emphasizing that the PM6L-doped approach is more capable of fabricating high-performance BHJ active layers with high coating speeds.
In particular, in situ spectroscopy measurements were performed to directly investigate the effects of PM6L-doping on BHJ film formation. Fig. 3A and B exhibit the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the dopant-free and PM6L-doped PM6:Y6 active layers during film formation, respectively. As exhibited in Fig. 3C, both systems fabricated at 2.3 m min−1 possess comparable PL peak heights as a function of film-formation time. Note that the corresponding PL peaks decreased rapidly in less than one second. In contrast, when the blading speed is 30.0 m min−1 (Fig. 3D and E), as depicted in Fig. 3F, the layer-thinning transition time of the active layers extended to three seconds because of the hysteretic solubility limit.48 Importantly, the transition from wet deposition to the layer-thinning state of the PM6L-doped system is lower than that of the dopant-free system. Moreover, to clarify the respective effects of PM6L on PM6 and Y6 neat films, we also carried out in situ PL measurements (Fig. S14 and S15, ESI†). Clearly, the PL peak height curves of the PM6 and Y6 neat films without and with PM6L-doping are comparable, while the PM6:Y6 blends with and without PM6L-doping show obvious differences. Since PM6L has good molecular compatibility with host materials (Fig. S16 and Table S7, ESI†), PM6L probably has a synergistic effect on the film-forming process of the PM6:Y6 BHJ active layer.
 Fig. 3  Evolution of in situ PL spectra of dopant-free (A and D) and PM6L-doped (B and E) active layers fabricated at the blade-coating speeds of 2.3 and 30.0 m min−1, respectively. The corresponding normalized peak heights of the dopant-free and PM6L-doped active layers at the blade-coating speeds of (C) 2.3 m min−1 and (F) 30.0 m min−1, respectively, plotted from 0 to 5.0 s. Time-dependent contour maps of the UV-vis spectra for the dopant-free (G and J) and PM6L-doped (H and K) active layers fabricated at the blade-coating speeds of 2.3 and 30.0 m min−1, respectively. Time evolution of the normalized absorption intensity at (I) 2.3 m min−1 and (L) 30.0 m min−1 blade-coating speeds, plotted from 0 to 5.0 s. 
The in situ ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra of the corresponding active layers during the blade-coating process were also monitored. As depicted in Fig. S17 (ESI†), the absorption spectrum shows different degrees of redshift and changes in absorption intensity with time. The film formation can be divided into three different stages, including solvent evaporation (I), liquid–solid transition (II), and film formation (III) (Fig. S18, ESI†). Note that the liquid–solid transition can be observed with a dramatic red shift. In order to represent this process more intuitively, we converted the variation of the absorption spectrum over time into a two-dimensional contour map (Fig. 3G,H and J,K). Correspondingly, the variation of the absorption intensity corresponds to the color variation of the contour maps of the dopant-free and PM6L-doped PM6:Y6 films fabricated at different coating speeds. Furthermore, Fig. S17C (ESI†) and Fig. 3I show the time evolution of the peak location and peak intensity extracted from in situ UV-vis absorption in PM6:Y6 films fabricated at a blading speed of 2.3 m min−1. The evolution of the peak location represents the aggregation behavior of active layer materials. The solution state peak location and absorption intensity of the dopant-free and PM6L-doped blends fabricated at low coating speeds persist for less than one second, which are consistent with the in situ PL results (Fig. 3C). Impressively, by comparing the time evolution of the peak location (Fig. S17F, ESI†) and peak intensity (Fig. 3L) of the two blends fabricated at a blade-coating speed of 30.0 m min−1, we found that the Y6 aggregation had dramatic differences between the dopant-free and PM6L doped BHJ blends. As the solvent continuously evaporates during the liquid–solid transition state, the absorption peak location of Y6 starts to redshift, indicating the onset of Y6 aggregation. We found that the redshift onset of the Y6 peak location and the peak intensity in the dopant-free blend happens earlier than that in the PM6L-doped blend, indicating that Y6 molecules aggregate in advance. After the rapid liquid–solid transition stage, the peak location of the control PM6:Y6 blend exhibits a small red shift compared to that of the PM6L-doped blend in the third stage. Thus, for the PM6L-doped PM6:Y6 system, the trace PM6L changed the molecular aggregation and the film formation behavior of PM6:Y6 owing to the increased film drying time combined with the good miscibility between PM6L and Y6 (Table S7, ESI†), which leads to the suitable phase separation size and crystallinity of Y6 in the film. Based on all the results discussed above, we have gained an important conclusion: as compared with the dopant-free PM6:Y6 system (Fig. 2A), the film-forming process of the PM6L doped system is slower and more conducive to maintaining well-defined domain sizes and a favorable bulk microstructure (Fig. 2B).
In addition to PM6:Y6, we also investigated the high-speed processability of the other three OSC systems based on different SMAs, including L8-BO,12 N3,49,50 and BTP-2F-ThCl.51 Relevant PCE values of the dopant-free and PM6L-doped systems as a function of blade-coating speed are presented in Fig. 4A, extracted from Fig. S19–S22 and Tables S8–S10 (ESI†). As the coating-speed increases from 2.0 to 30.0 m min−1, all three systems without PM6L-doping exhibited obvious PCE losses (from 17.13% to 15.59% for PM6:L8-BO, 15.69% to 12.76% for PM6:N3 and 14.98% to 13.04% for PM6:BTP-2F-ThCl, respectively). On the contrary, the PM6L-doped devices fabricated at a blade-coating speed of 30.0 m min−1 show promising PCEs of 16.83%, 15.73%, and 15.60% for PM6:L8-BO, PM6:N3, and PM6:BTP-2F-ThCl, respectively. These results strongly demonstrate the universality of this PM6L-doping strategy, which is conducive to the high-throughput production of OSCs in the near future. Here we further explored the large-scale PM6:Y6 solar modules with an active area of 7.5 cm2. The real solar module with a designed configuration can be found in Fig. S23 (ESI†). Fig. 4B presents the J–V curves of the corresponding solar modules fabricated at various blade-coating speeds, and the related performance parameters are provided in Table 2. The dopant-free solar modules fabricated at blade-coating speeds of 2.3 and 30.0 m min−1 delivered the PCEs of 15.22% and 11.06%, respectively, indicating the huge performance differences owing to the abovementioned morphological characteristics. To demonstrate this point, we obtained optical microscopy images, as shown in Fig. S24 and S25 (ESI†) for the dopant-free PM6:Y6 active layer fabricated at 2.3 and 30.0 m min−1, respectively. Compared with the dopant-free system fabricated at a low coating speed, the corresponding system prepared at a high coating speed showed obvious particles and large-scale domains. The PM6L-doped system in contrast can maintain good uniformity even at a high coating speed of 30.0 m min−1 (see Fig. S26, ESI†). Consequently, the PM6L-doped solar modules fabricated at a blade-coating speed of 30.0 m min−1 exhibited a PCE of 14.70%, which is slightly lower than that of the dopant-free solar module fabricated at 2.3 m min−1. Thus, this work exhibits that this PM6L-doping approach can effectively overcome the inherent limitations of the high-throughput production of OSCs in BHJ processing scalability.

Additionally, using a reported bottom-up manufacturing cost (MC) model,41,42,52–54 we performed a techno-economic analysis, as shown in Fig. 4C. When the linear blade-coating speed is increased from 2.3 to 30.0 m min−1, the MSP of the dopant-free system is reduced by approximately 5.82 $ Wp−1. Importantly, the PM6L-doped system can lead to a lower MSP (5.96 $ Wp−1). This result further demonstrates that this doping strategy can play an important role in the high-throughput production of OSC modules with a BHJ architecture whilst retaining their high performance. This result also delivers meaningful inspiration to guide the development of active layer materials and systems, including: (1) Apart from the golden triangle elements (device efficiency, device stability, and synthesis cost), high-speed processability should also be evaluated when designing photovoltaic materials and D:A systems; (2) new guest components (additives and/or third components) can provide more possibilities to improve the comprehensive performance of host systems; (3) developing novel processing technologies is another way to complete the high-speed processability of the BHJ systems. All in all, a complete evaluation of photovoltaic materials needs to contain an index related to high-speed processability.
3. Conclusion
In summary, we developed a PM6L-doping approach to overcome the inherent fabrication limitation of the PM6:Y6 active layer in terms of high-speed coating preparation. The morphological characteristics and physical mechanisms as well as the in situ spectroscopy measurements demonstrated that the film-forming process of the PM6L doped system is more conducive to maintaining well-defined phase separation sizes and molecular aggregations. In contrast, an accelerated liquid–solid transition significantly disrupts the corresponding film formation process of the dopant-free PM6:Y6 system fabricated at high blade-coating speeds, thus resulting in inferior BHJ morphology. Moreover, the high-speed fabrications of three other active layer systems (PM6:L8-BO, PM6:N3, and PM6:BTP-2F-ThCl) as well as the production of large-area PM6:Y6 solar modules as a function of blade-coating speed strongly highlight the universality of this PM6L-doping strategy and indicate that it is a simple processing approach for the cost-effective manufacturing of high-performance OSCs. Combined with the techno-economic analysis, these results deliver valuable guidelines and insights to develop coating-speed-insensitive active layer materials and processing technologies. This work also provides a vital avenue to extend the current efforts and achievements into commercial applications of OSCs.

Broader context
The coating speeds of the reported active layer systems fabricated by roll-to-roll-available processing technologies (like doctor-blade (DB) coating and slot-die coating), which were routinely coated at linear speeds of 0.3–1.5 m min−1, are far behind the printing processes of relevant interfacial layers and metal electrodes (>10 m min−1). The inferior linear speeds for active layer fabrication inevitably limit the production capacity of the entire production line, thus resulting in a remarkable increase in the manufacturing minimum sustainable price (MSP) of industrial-scale organic photovoltaics (OPVs). Based on this view, a high coating speed (or high throughput) should be also used to judge the commercial feasibility of OPV modules. Herein, we reported a polymeric micro-doping strategy to facilitate high-speed fabrication of the active layer while maintaining its favorable device performance. Further techno-economic analysis manifests that this method can lead to MSP reductions. Overall, current efforts provide an important way to extend the current success of OPVs into commercial applications.
