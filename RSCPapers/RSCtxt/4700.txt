Introduction
Antireflective (AR) thin films have been attracting much attention for their applications in optical devices, display devices and photovoltaic cells as a result of their ability to enhance transmittance and remove ghost images.1–6 There would be no reflection if there is a destructive interference between the light reflected from the film–substrate and the air–film interfaces. For BK7 glasses, which have a refractive index (RI) of 1.52, the RI of a quarter-wave AR thin film must be approximately 1.22. In recent years, varied approaches have been developed to improve the transmittance of glass substrates by introducing nanopores into their surface silica (SiO2) thin films.7–11 Among them hollow SiO2 nanoparticles have been proved to be good building blocks for AR thin films because the inner cavity of the SiO2 nanoparticles offers a large volume for tuning the RI of the AR thin films. Unfortunately, the obtained thin films usually suffer from poor functional durability and mechanical robustness or complex fabrication process, hindering their practical applications. The main reasons are that SiO2 particles are bond to each other and to the substrate only, by random dense packing and/or van der Waals forces and transparency gradually decreases due to contamination.12
Applying titania (TiO2) in SiO2 thin films was considered as a promising way to improve the durability and robustness of AR thin films because of its highly interesting performance including photoinduced superhydrophilicity, photocatalytic activity, high hardness, antibacterial function, etc.13–16 Hybridization of SiO2 and TiO2 is currently utilized to attain high-performance of AR thin films by overcoming the disadvantages of single SiO2 nanoparticle thin films. Recent studies of SiO2&TiO2 hybrid films have been focused mainly on alternate bilayered/multilayered thin films, composite stacked thin films and core–shell structure thin films.14,15,17,18 Schubert et al. reported an optimized four-layered AR coating utilizing tailored- and low-RI SiO2 and co-sputtered SiO2/TiO2 nanoporous thin films on inverted metamorphic solar cell devices.19 Compared to traditional double-layered AR coatings, the four-layered AR coating decreased the wavelength-averaged normal incidence reflectance from 7.9% to 3.9% and achieved an averaged current–density improvement of 34.4%. However, the fabrication process is complicated and expensive for large area preparation and application. Huang and co-workers fabricated TiO2–SiO2 stack coatings on glass by dip-coating.20 The maximum transmittance of coated substrates was up to 99.16%, and the efficiency of CIGS solar cells was increased from 11.20% to 12.15% by introducing the AR coating. Nevertheless, the coating (WCA: 25°–80°) was not superhydrophilic, which is favorable for self-cleaning and antifogging functions. He's group prepared a series of raspberry-like SiO2–TiO2 nanoparticles, which were used as building blocks for fabricating self-cleaning and AR coatings.21 Calcined coatings with the maximum transmittance of 97.3% showed excellent photocatalytic decomposition ability towards organic contaminants. This work did not, however, carry out detailed research on the mechanical properties of the films. Although fabrication of multifunctional films through a simple process is of great importance for practical applications, it has been proven, to date, that it is generally difficult to fabricate a multifunctional thin film with as many desired characteristics as possible (i.e. a combination of AR, self-cleaning, anti-fogging, damp-proof, high hardness and anti-scratch) by a simple process and at low cost.
In the current work, we propose SiO2&TiO2 double-shell hollow nanospheres (DSHNs) and DSHNs-based multifunctional AR thin films. The design concepts include two aspects. Firstly, TiO2 is used as a binder to link SiO2 hollow nanospheres with each other as well as with the substrate. The van der Waals interactions between the nanospheres are thus transformed into chemical bonds to improve the mechanical robustness of thin films because of the formation of Si–O–Ti chemical bonds. As a result, the mechanical properties would be improved effectively. Secondly, since TiO2 covers the outside of the hollow SiO2 nanospheres, only a small amount of TiO2 (RI = 2.5) is required and would not significantly affect the transmittance of the thin film coated substrates. Thirdly, TiO2 can also offer a number of advantageous features to thin films. The nano-composite SiO2–TiO2 films would exhibit intrinsic superhydrophilicity in addition to photo-induced superhydrophilicity, which could persist over periods ranging up to several days or months in the absence of UV light.22 The superhydrophilic properties of thin films would allow water to spread completely across their surfaces rather than remaining as droplets, endowing the film surfaces with self-cleaning and anti-fogging properties. Meanwhile, nano-composite SiO2–TiO2 films have a strong catalytic power due to granular interface effects. Therefore, AR thin films would rely no longer on manual cleaning, but on decomposition of organic contaminants by light induced redox-reaction.
DSHNs were designed, synthesized and utilized as building blocks for fabricating multifunctional AR thin films. Multifunctional SiO2&TiO2 hybrid thin films based on SiO2&TiO2 DSHNs were fabricated by a simple sol–gel reaction and calcination method. By optimizing the porosity of the SiO2&TiO2 DSHN and thin film structure, substrates with DSHN thin films attained maximum transmittance as high as 99.4% and average transmittance up to 98.5% in the visible region. The nano-composite SiO2–TiO2 films exhibited intrinsic superhydrophilicity, anti-fogging and high catalytic activity. The presence of TiO2 in the thin films led to significant improvement of mechanical robustness and function durability. The tape peeling test, sponge washing test, and high temperature and moisture proof test showed the favorable robustness and function durability of thin films, which make them extremely attractive for applications in lenses, photovoltaic cells and windows of high-rise buildings.
Experimental
Materials
Hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), hydrochloric acid (38%), absolute ethanol (99.5%), acetone, Triton X-100, cyclohexane, and methylene blue (MB, 98.5%) were purchased from Beihua Fine Chemicals. Poly (acrylic acid) (PAA, 30 wt% in water, Mw = 5000) was purchased from Shandong Heli water treatment company. Tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS, 99+%) and titanium(IV) n-butoxide (TNBT, 98+%) were obtained from Alfa Aesar. All chemicals were of analytic grade and used without further purification. Ultrapure water with a resistivity higher than 18.2 MΩ cm was used in all experiments, and was obtained from a three-stage Millipore Mill-Q Plus 185 purification system (Academic). A 3 M adhesive tape was obtained from a commercial source. K-9 glasses were bought from Shanghai Jijia Optical Instrument Co.
Methods
Preparation of SiO2 hollow nanosphere (HN) sol
In a typical procedure, 0.1–0.5 g of PAA dissolved in 3–5 mL aqueous ammonia was mixed with 90 mL of absolute ethanol. This was followed by the injection of 0.5–4.0 mL TEOS under vigorous magnetic stirring at room temperature. After 12 h, 45 nm SiO2 HNs were formed. Ammonia (NH3) was removed by stirring the sol in a ventilating cabinet. The solid concentration of the target HN sol was estimated to be 0.8 wt%.
Preparation of SiO2&TiO2 double-shelled hollow nanosphere (DSHN) sol
Hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC, 0.1–0.4 g) was dissolved in the HN sol. Then, 0.5–2.0 mL TNBT mixed with 7.5 mL ethanol was injected using a syringe pump at a rate of 0.5 mL min−1. After the injection, the temperature was increased to 90 °C under vigorous stirring, and refluxed for 3 h. The sol was then allowed to cool to room temperature, and was aged at room temperature for 7–30 d.
SiO2 HN thin film assembly
A glass substrate was sonicated in deionized water for at least 15 min, and then treated by oxygen plasma (84 W, 5 min) under an oxygen flow of 800 mL min−1. The cleaned glass substrate was immersed in the SiO2 HN sol for 30 s, and withdrawn from the sol at 150 mm min−1, followed by drying for 2 min at room temperature (25 °C). Each glass substrate was subjected to dip-coating twice (two layers). Glass substrates coated with SiO2 HN thin films were eventually calcined at 550 °C for 3 h.
SiO2&TiO2 DSHN thin film assembly
A cleaned glass substrate was immersed in the SiO2&TiO2 DSHN sol for 30 s, and withdrawn from the sol at 50–200 mm min−1, followed by drying for 2 min at room temperature (25 °C). Each substrate was subjected to dip-coating twice (two layers). The glass substrates coated with SiO2&TiO2 DSHN thin films were eventually calcined at 550 °C for 3 h.
Characterization
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observations were carried out using a Hitachi S-4800 field emission scanning electron microscope. The specimens were coated with a layer of gold by ion sputtering before SEM observations. For transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observations, powder products were dispersed in ethanol by sonication for 10 min, and added on carbon-coated copper grids. After drying at 60 °C overnight, they were observed using a JEOL JEM-2100F transmission electron microscope at an acceleration voltage of 150 kV. The roughness and morphology of film surfaces were characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM) using an MM8-SYS scanning probe microscope (Bruker AXR). Transmission and reflection spectra in the wavelength range of 300–2500 nm were recorded using a Varian Cary 5000 UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer. Water contact angles (WCAs) of the film surfaces were measured at ambient temperature on a JC2000C contact angle/interface system (Shanghai Zhongchen Digital Technique Apparatus Co.), the angle precision of which is ±0.5°. Water droplets of 3 μL were dropped carefully onto the film surfaces. Once a water droplet came in contact with the sample surface, the machine began to take photos at a speed of 30 photos per s, i.e., the interval between the contact moment and the first image was 33 ms. The measurement was carried out on three different areas of the sample surface. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the prepared products, recorded on a Bruker D8 Focus X-ray diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.154184 nm), were used to identify phase constitutions in the products.
The photocatalytic self-cleaning properties of prepared thin films were evaluated by investigating their ability to decompose MB under UV irradiation. A MB stock solution of 2 mg L−1 was prepared. UV irradiation was provided by a high pressure mercury lamp (250 W) through a thick transparent jacket with circulating-water to cool the lamp and remove the effects of heat. The glass substrates with the SiO2 HN thin film and the SiO2&TiO2 DSHN thin film were dipped in a MB solution of 2 mg L−1 for 60 s, and withdrawn at a speed of 15 cm min−1, followed by drying in air at ambient temperature. The specimens with MB were then exposed to UV irradiation. The decomposition of MB was monitored on the basis of gradual disappearance of the MB peak in the transmission spectra using a TU-1901 spectrophotometer.
Results and discussion
Morphology and structure of SiO2 HN, SiO2&TiO2 DSHN and SiO2&TiO2 DSHN thin films
Recently, a number of synthetic methods23,24 have been used to synthesize SiO2 HNs. In the current synthesis protocol, we used a facile one-step solution-based synthetic route to produce SiO2 HNs.25 The thickness of the shell was controlled by varying the amount of TEOS, and the ratio of PAA to ethanol determined the HN particle size. As shown in Fig. 1a, the mean diameter and shell thickness of SiO2 HNs were measured to be ca. 41 ± 8 nm and ca. 10 ± 3 nm. The deposition of the TiO2 layer on the SiO2 HNs was carried out through the hydrolysis reaction of TNBT under vigorous stirring. The SiO2&TiO2 DSHN sol was stable without any precipitation for more than three months. The thickness of the TiO2 shell could be conveniently tuned either by changing the added amount of TNBT or by carrying out multiple coatings. Under typical reaction conditions, the TiO2 coating procedure produced a ca. 11 ± 4 nm thick TiO2 shell, and the mean diameter of SiO2&TiO2 DSHNs were ca. 51 ± 9 nm (Fig. 1b).

K-9 glass was dip-coated in the SiO2&TiO2 DSHN sol, and then calcined at 550 °C to achieve superhydrophilicity and good photocatalytic properties. A top-view SEM image (Fig. 1c) shows that the glass substrate was homogeneously covered by SiO2&TiO2 DSHNs. It is noted that nanocrystals of ca. 10 nm appeared on the thin film after locally magnifying the image. These nanocrystals resulted from the transformation of amorphous TiO2 shell. From a cross-sectional SEM image (Fig. 1d), it could be seen that the spherical nanoparticles were connected to each other and densely packed on the substrate. The thin film thickness was estimated to be ca. 120 nm. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of SiO2&TiO2 DSHN powder are shown in Fig. S1,† which exhibit reflections associated with the (101), (004) and (200) lattice planes of the anatase phase. The XRD patterns could be used to estimate the size of anatase crystallites according to the Scherrer equation. The crystallite size of TiO2 in DSHNs after calcination at 550 °C for 3 h was thus estimated by measuring the (101) peak in the diffraction patterns. It was calculated to be ca. 11 nm, agreeing well with the results by SEM observations.
To further analyze the relationship between SiO2 and TiO2 components in the SiO2&TiO2 DSHN thin film, the IR spectrum of TiO2&SiO2 DSHN powder was recorded and is shown in Fig. S2.† The distinct band of Ti–O–Si vibration (970 cm−1) is observed for the TiO2&SiO2 DSHN powder. The bands at 793 and 1114 cm−1 are attributed to the symmetric Si–O–Si stretching vibration and asymmetric Si–O–Si stretching vibration, respectively. These observations indicate that Si exists as both segregated amorphous SiO2 and that bonded to Ti through Ti–O–Si bonding.26,27 According to the literature, the band at 1400 cm−1 is attributed to the Ti–O–Ti vibration. However, it is not found in the spectrum. It may be submerged in the peak at 1110 cm−1 with high intensity, since TiO2 crystalline grains clearly appear on the SEM image of the TiO2&SiO2 DSHN thin film. The presence of chemical bonding between titania and silica plays an important role in improving the mechanical properties of the thin film.
Optical performance of SiO2&TiO2 DSHN thin films
The Fresnel equation offers a basic mathematical model of the reflection of films. For an ideal homogeneous single-layered AR film, its refractive index nc has to meet the following two conditions: (1) nc = (nans)1/2, (2) d = λ/4nc, where na and ns are the refractive indices of the air and the substrate, respectively, d is the thickness of the coating, and λ is the wavelength of incident light. Since no existing bulk material possesses such a low refractive index and single-layered AR film could only suppress a certain wavelength reflectance to 0, multi-layered films are usually fabricated to obtain antireflection of broad spectrum.28 For multi-layered coatings, there exists the following relationship:29Rsum = R01 + R12 + R23 + … + Rns, where the reflected light from the interface ij between the adjacent layers i and j is: Rij = |Rmn| exp [−2(δi + δj)] (|Rmn| = [(ni − nj)/(ni + nj)], δi = 2πnidicosθi/λ, θi is the angle of refraction and di is the physical thickness of the layer.
In the current work, due to the voids in the nanoporous film, its apparent refractive index is lower than bulk SiO2 and TiO2 materials, which endow the thin film with excellent AR properties. By adjusting the cavity size, shell thicknesses of SiO2 and TiO2 in SiO2&TiO2 DSHNs, suitable apparent refractive index would be obtained. By adjusting withdrawing speeds of dip-coating, suitable film thicknesses would be obtained. Thus, a minimum Rsum and an optimum AR multi-layered coating can be achieved.
To illustrate the AR performance of the prepared thin films by different withdrawing speeds, the transmittance spectra, reflectance spectra, and average transmittance and reflectance of SiO2&TiO2 DSHN thin film coated K-9 glass were measured over the solar spectrum, and are shown in Fig. 2 and Table 1. For the coated substrates, greatly enhanced transmittance was observed in the visible to IR spectral range as compared to blank K-9 glass. The maximum transmittance reached as high as 99.4% and the minimum reflectance decreased to 0.8% at a wavelength of 532 nm. Since 532 nm is in the middle of the visible light wavelength range, it is the most common visible laser output wavelength. High power laser ignited fusion, which is expected to provide an efficient and non-pollutive electrical source in the future, has been attracting much attention.30 Using an AR film is an effective way to avoid optical reflection which would result in the reduction of energy output. The thin film with a transmittance higher than 99% at 532 nm has a great application potential for visible lasers. In addition to high-precision optical components, antireflection technology is also widely used in flat panel displays and solar cells.31,32 Usually, displays require AR films having good performance in the visible region (380–780 nm) while solar cells focus on the visible-infrared region (380–1100 nm). Therefore, we summarized the average transmittance (Ta) and reflectance (Ra) of SiO2&TiO2 DSHN films fabricated by different withdrawing speeds in the visible region and the visible–infrared region. As shown in Table 1, in the spectral range of 380–780 nm, the maximum Ta of SiO2&TiO2 DSHN thin film coated K-9 glasses reached 98.6% as compared to that (91.8%) of blank K-9 glass and the minimum Ra decreased to 1.7% as compared to that (9.2%) of blank K-9 glass. In the spectral range of 380–1100 nm, the maximum Ta of SiO2&TiO2 DSHN thin film coated K-9 glasses reached 97.5% as compared to that (92.0%) of blank K-9 glass and the minimum Ra decreased to 2.5% as compared to that (9.0%) of blank K-9 glass. Thus, the SiO2&TiO2 DSHN films showed excellent AR properties in the wavelength range of 380 nm to 1100 nm.

Ordered or disordered periodic microstructures or randomly spaced micro/nanostructures on the scale of the color wavelengths could lead to selective reflection of particular light wavelengths through constructive and destructive interference. Thus, the reflected color is a function of the spectrum of incident light and the reflection spectrum of the surface.33,34 Digital photographs in Fig. 2 show the corresponding interface reflection toward a fluorescent lamp on the surface of SiO2&TiO2 DSHN thin films fabricated by varied withdrawing speeds. Reflected colors varying from yellow to pink to violet to blue were observed when the films were viewed by the naked eye in the reflected light. The uniform reflection suggests the presence of uniform coatings. In recent years, the study of structural color has been attracting much attention from biology to optics.35
Wettability of SiO2&TiO2 DSHN thin films
Superhydrophilic coatings, which can effectively prevent water condensation on transparent substrates, are of great importance in a variety of practical applications. The wettability of SiO2&TiO2 DSHN thin films was investigated by measuring their water contact angles (WCAs) after 0.5 s spreading of water droplets because superhydrophilicity is defined as reaching a WCA of less than 5° within less than 0.5 s. Time-dependent changes in WCA on the surface of SiO2 HN and SiO2&TiO2 DSHN thin films are shown in Fig. 3a. The volume of water droplets for the measurements was set at 3 μL. The glass substrates coated with a SiO2 HN thin film and a SiO2&TiO2 DSHN thin film were both hydrophilic, while only the latter was superhydrophilic. The static contact angle of the SiO2 HN thin film and the SiO2&TiO2 DSHN thin film (Fig. 3b) were 13° and 0.6°, respectively. According to early theoretical works by Wenzel36 and Quéré et al.37 one of the factors affecting the wettability of a surface with water is surface roughness. Previous studies38–40 have pointed out that high surface roughness is conducive to establish an ideal condition for extreme superhydrophilic behavior. AFM observations (Fig. S3†) show, however, the root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of the SiO2 HN thin film and the SiO2&TiO2 DSHN thin film were 13.1 nm and 14.3 nm, respectively, i.e., the RMS of the latter only differs (increases) by 1.2 nm from the former. Therefore, the change of roughness would not be a major factor impacting the hydrophilicity of SiO2&TiO2 DSHN thin films. Generally, the photo-induced superhydrophilicity of the TiO2 film surface rapidly vanishes when the film is stored in the absence of UV exposure. In the current work, however, the thin film could appear superhydrophilic without UV illumination over a month. The observed superhydrophilicity might be explained by the synergistic effect between SiO2 and TiO2. From the IR spectrum, the Ti–O–Si bonds formed, thus the charge balance might have been destroyed and the oxygen atoms might be unsaturated.27 Within the SiO2&TiO2 hybrid film network, because Si atoms were substituted by Ti atoms, the SiO2&TiO2 granular interfaces were less electronegative and more polarizable. And the interfacial substitution of Ti atoms by Si atoms is the opposite. Therefore, deprotonated TiOx− and/or protonated SiOx+ units finally form. As proposed in previous papers,41,42 these localized electric charges may favor adsorption of water on the surface of the nanocomposite films, which is beneficial for obtaining and enhancing natural superhydrophilicity of films.

(b) Digital images of water contact angle tests for SiO2 HN thin film (left) and SiO2&TiO2 DSHN thin film (right). (c) Digital image exhibiting antifogging properties of uncoated (left) and SiO2&TiO2 DSHN-coated (right) glass substrates. 
The SiO2&TiO2 DSHN thin film was also found to exhibit excellent antifogging behavior. As shown in Fig. 3b, under relative humidity (RH) of 20–40%, when the SiO2 HN thin film and SiO2&TiO2 DSHN thin film coated glass substrates were placed on a cup of ca. 90 °C hot water, the SiO2 HN thin film coated glass fogged immediately and many condensed droplets and strong light scattering were observed. In contrast, the glass coated with the SiO2&TiO2 DSHN thin film could significantly prevent fogging by almost instantaneously spreading condensed water droplets to form a thin sheet-like water membrane. Superhydrophilic coatings, which can effectively prevent water condensation on transparent substrates, are therefore of great importance in a variety of practical applications.
Photocatalytic performance of SiO2&TiO2 DSHN thin films
Titanium oxide, especially anatase, is known to be photocatalytically active. It can decompose organic contaminants under UV light. Nanosized TiO2 particles usually show higher photocatalytic activity than the pigment type because of their larger specific surface area, which facilitates the diffusion of excited electrons and holes toward the surface before their recombination.43 Thus, development of suitable techniques to form transparent anatase nanocomposite films on various substrates is essential for practical applications of TiO2 as a photocatalyst for pollutant-decomposition in hydrophilic surface systems.44,45 The photocatalytic activity of SiO2&TiO2 DSHN thin films was assessed by its degradation of methylene blue (MB). The thin film coated glass substrate was immersed in a MB aqueous solution (2 mg L−1) for 150 s, and withdrawn at 15 cm min−1. The thin film showed a significant decrease in transmittance because of adsorbing MB, and a trough at the wavelength of 665 nm was observed (Fig. 4a). Upon UV irradiation, however, the transmittance at 650 nm increased as a function of irradiation time, and after 3 h, MB was completely decomposed. In contrast, only 38% of the MB adsorbed on the SiO2 HN thin film was degraded in 1.5 h under otherwise identical conditions. Thus, the SiO2&TiO2 DSHN thin film showed excellent photocatalytic properties. When the rate of photocatalytic mineralization is higher than the contamination rate, the SiO2&TiO2 thin film would keep the surface free from organic contamination under UV illumination.

Durability in heat damp environment
Regarding the practical use of self-cleaning AR thin films in PV modules and windows, it is important for the thin films to withstand high humid and temperature environment. Typically, the solar glass used in PV modules usually encounters constant temperature between 21 °C and 53 °C during operation.10 Therefore, the AR thin films on solar glass must be able to resist external weathering, including moisture, rain and high temperatures. Unfortunately, the porous surface of AR thin films, especially mesoporous thin films, are prone to adsorb water and contaminants, which give rise to variation in the RI and thus decrease in the transmittance of thin films. Therefore, we designed a damp heat test to evaluate the durability of the prepared films. In the test, the SiO2&TiO2 DSHN thin film coated slide glass was placed in an incubator at constant temperature and humidity for a few days (T: 50 °C, RH: 95%). As a control experiment, a HN SiO2 thin film was deposited and optimized on slide glass, achieving a Tmax of 98.9%.

Fig. 5a and b show variation in average transmittance (Tave) as a function of testing time for the SiO2&TiO2 DSHN thin film and the SiO2 HN thin film. After a 14 d test, the Tave value for the SiO2 HN thin film decreased to 93.1%, which is 96.5% of the initial value. Clearly, the SiO2 HN thin film was not satisfying for long-term durability. Nevertheless, the SiO2&TiO2 DSHN thin film demonstrated a much better durability. After a 14 d test, the Tave value for the SiO2&TiO2 DSHN thin film decreased to 96.9%, which is 97.3% of the initial value. It preserved 99.4% of the initial Tave after the test. The above results confirmed that the hybrid film had excellent resistance to moisture at high temperature, and the film structures were able to circumvent the infiltration of water more effectively.

According to previous studies,46–48 a process of aqueous attack occurred on the film and substrate during the test. The corrosion takes place in two steps: (1) H+ of water in the form of H3O+ first diffuses into the glass and exchanges with cations, leading to a hydrated layer; (2) Si–O–Si bridging bonds are subsequently hydrated, breaking up the network and forming a gel, which leads to network dissolution. The better durability of the hybrid thin film indicates that TiO2 hindered the aqueous attack on the SiO2 HNs and glass substrate. Thus, in addition to its self-cleaning effect, the TiO2 shell also functioned as a barrier layer to protect SiO2 HNs and glass substrate from aqueous corrosion. In fact, not only TiO2 films, but other dense films like acid-catalyzed SiO2 films and Al2O3 films have also been reported for improving durability.10,48
Mechanical properties of SiO2&TiO2 DSHN thin films
To assess the mechanical robustness of SiO2&TiO2 DSHN thin films, two complementary tests were performed. First, a 3M Scotch transparent tape was pressed on the surfaces of SiO2 the HN thin film and the SiO2&TiO2 DSHN thin film (Fig. 6a). As shown in Fig. 6b, a clear boundary separating the untested and tested area is visible for the SiO2 HN thin film under SEM observations. The area in the red box is almost particle free, indicating the poor adhesion of SiO2 HNs to the substrate. Because the particles are bonded to each other and to the substrate only by van der Waals interactions, the SiO2 HN thin film suffered from poor mechanical robustness. In contrast, as shown in Fig. 6c, peeling the tape off did not, surprisingly, change the nanoparticle coverage of the SiO2&TiO2 DSHN film. Fig. 6d shows the surface structure change from the SiO2 HN thin film to the SiO2&TiO2 DSHN thin film. As a binder, TiO2 filled in the gaps surrounding the HNs, making the particles bonded to each other and to the substrate via Si–O–Ti chemical bonds. The current test suggests that the mechanical properties of the hybrid thin film have been strengthened dramatically.

In the second test, the scrubbing resistance of SiO2&TiO2 DSHN thin films was tested. For outdoor applications such as solar panels and architectural windows, it is crucial to withstand regular scrubbing. The SiO2 HN thin film and the SiO2&TiO2 DSHN thin film were washed by sponge brush (ASTM D4828-92) for up to 100 cycles in 2 min. We measured the changes in transmittance and surface morphology of the thin films before and after the test. As shown in Fig. 4Sa and b,† the maximum transmittance of the SiO2 HN thin film decreased by 4% after the washing test. Nanoparticles on the tested film surface were almost completely cleansed. The film can't pass the scrubbing test. As shown in Fig. 7a, the maximum transmittance of the SiO2&TiO2 DSHN thin film did not change. Only tiny changes took place in the transmittance spectrum. The transmittance slightly increased in the wavelength range of 345–532 nm and slightly decreased in the wavelength range of 532–1200 nm. It might be attributed to changes in the film thickness and surface structure, as revealed in Fig. 7b and c. The minor changes in transmittance (<1%) and surface structure (<5%) indicate that the hybrid thin film could pass the scrubbing test and endure practical washing.

Conclusions
In summary, a novel, simple method to fabricate multi-functional thin films was demonstrated on the basis of SiO2&TiO2 DSHNs. The well-defined structures of SiO2&TiO2 DSHNs and corresponding thin films were illustrated. The broadband antireflection performance of SiO2&TiO2 DSHN films was achieved with the maximum transmittance as high as 99.4% at 532 nm. The average transmittance in the 380–780 nm and 380–1100 nm range was 98.6% and 97.5%, respectively. The unique double-shell structure of nano-composite SiO2–TiO2 films exhibits natural superhydrophilicity, which endows the film surface with self-cleaning and anti-fogging characteristics and abiding duality for months without UV light. Furthermore, due to the strong photocatalytic power of the nano-composite SiO2–TiO2 films, the AR thin films could decompose organic contaminants by light induced redox-reaction instead of relying on manual cleaning. In addition, TiO2 was used as a binder to link silica hollow particles with each other as well as with the substrate, significantly improving the mechanical robustness of the thin films. The hybrid thin films retained high transparency after adhesive tape peeling and washing tests. Further, the hybrid double-shell hollowsphere structure resulted in much enhanced resistance to moisture. Therefore, the prepared SiO2&TiO2 DSHN thin films showed high transparency, superhydrophilicity, photocatalytic activity, anti-fogging effect, mechanical robustness and good durability against damp heat. The hybrid thin films have potential to be applied in energy harvesting and optical instrumentation in extreme climates or under humid conditions.
