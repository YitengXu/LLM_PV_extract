    , Accepted 19th December 2016First published on 20th December 2016AbstractThe development of low-cost photocatalysts capable of selectively producing liquid chemicals from CO2 and water with efficiency and durability comparable to typical photosynthetic values remains a great challenge. Herein, we report a facile, environmentally benign synthesis of CuFeO2 and CuO binary films by electrodeposition, and demonstrate that these binary films produce only liquid formate from aqueous CO2 at ∼1% energy efficiency, while driving O2 evolution from water on a wired Pt plate under continuous irradiation of simulated sunlight (AM 1.5G; 100 mW cm−2) over 24 h. The formate production is confirmed by quantitative analysis of H13CO2− produced from 13CO2. A time-resolved photoluminescence study reveals the sub-nanosecond charge transfer in binary CuFeO2 and CuO films, wherein the aqueous CO2 is adsorbed. An as-synthesized photocatalyst film with a three dimensional, double layer configuration shows the continued production of formate for over 17 d. However, the crystalline structure and elemental state of the used photocatalysts undergo gradual chemical reduction. Such a deformation can be thermally healed by recycling the weekly used samples via oxidative annealing. Thus, a single photocatalyst sample produces formate continuously for 35 d.
1. Introduction
Sunlight is the most essential energy source driving the majority of biological and environmental processes.1 Harnessing and utilizing sunlight at high efficiency have represented a great challenge in the achievement of a carbon neutral society over the past four decades.2–6 Recently, the photocatalytic conversion of CO2 into value-added chemicals (e.g., CO, formate, methanol, etc.) has received renewed attention.7–10 It uniquely mimics natural photosynthesis in terms of light absorption and conversion as well as storage of the absorbed photon energy into chemical bond energy. Despite this similarity, photocatalytic synthesis still suffers from low selectivity (mixture of several gaseous and aqueous chemicals), poor energy efficiency, synthetic process complexity, rapid deactivation of catalysts, and expensive co-catalyst usage. Furthermore, most photocatalysts fail to simultaneously bring about water oxidation, which is the essential counter reaction of sustainable proton-coupled reduction. For comparison, the state-of-the-art solar-to-hydrogen energy efficiency in photocatalyst films is reported to increase to ∼1%.11
Photocatalytic systems satisfying all requirements, e.g., efficiency, selectivity, cost, durability, and scalability, are expected to emerge in the near future. Meanwhile, electrically biased systems are shown to afford the production of CO gas from CO2 at energy efficiencies of 0.3–6%, while producing O2via water oxidation in the configurations of PV-wired or embedded electrolysis.12–15 However, only a few research groups have succeeded in synthesizing liquid formate from CO2 at an energy efficiency of over ∼1% with O2 generation in the tandem configuration.16 The energy efficiency of these PV-electrolysis systems is expected to gradually increase as the knowledge and development of electrocatalysts advance. Nevertheless, this combined system still faces several challenges such as difficulty in matching the dissimilar performances of PV and electrocatalysis (primary reason for energy loss), rapid deactivation of PV and/or electrocatalysts, and preferential synthesis of liquid chemicals that are storable and portable.
For the stand-alone photocatalytic synthesis of liquid chemicals, p-type semiconductors are favored because of the direct yet controllable injection of minority carriers to interfacial CO2.17,18 We have explored CO2-photoactive p-type materials14,19,20 and found that sunlit CuFeO2 and CuO mixed oxide (CuFeO2/CuO) films produce liquid formate from CO2 at ∼1% energy efficiency and >90% selectivity, continuously over 24 h in the absence of electrical bias and PV-assistance.20 Furthermore, O2 evolved from water at the counter electrode (Pt foil) wired to CuFeO2/CuO during the same period. Such high efficiency was attributed to the suitable optical band gap (1.4–1.7 eV) and energy levels for CO2 reduction and water oxidation.
Herein, an in-depth study was carried out in order to clarify why this binary oxide composed of earth abundant Cu and Fe exhibits such unprecedentedly high efficiency and durability. The use of isotope-labeled reagents (13CO2 and H13CO3−) quantitatively confirmed the production of formate from CO2. The synthetic mechanism of the photocatalyst films and the charge transfer kinetics were examined to find the reason behind the formate production efficiency. In addition, the formate production was monitored over several weeks, and the photocatalyst surface was analyzed using various characterization tools. Finally, a straightforward and facile guideline for the use of binary photocatalysts over five weeks is presented.
2. Experimental
2.1. Fabrication of samples
Pieces of fluorine-doped SnO2 (F:SnO2, FTO) coated glass (Pilkington, ∼50 nm-thick FTO layer, 1.5 cm × 3 cm) were cleaned ultrasonically in ethanol for 10 min, rinsed with distilled water, and dried. A certain area (0.5 cm × 0.5 cm) of the FTO substrates was exposed to aqueous potassium perchlorate solutions (KClO4, 50 mM, >99%, Aldrich) containing Cu(NO3)2·3H2O (4 mM, >99%, Aldrich) and Fe(ClO4)3·H2O (12 mM, >99.9%, Aldrich). Unless otherwise specified, the Fe/Cu ratio was fixed to 3:1. Next, the substrates were held at −0.36 V vs. SCE (saturated calomel electrode) for different times (primarily 0.5, 1, and 2 h) using a potentiostat/galvanostat (Ivium). Dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO, >99%, Aldrich) and deionized water (>18 MΩ cm) were used as solvents of the mixed solutions to compare the solvent effect on the electrodeposition. Platinum gauze was used as the counter electrode. After drying in air, the as-deposited samples were annealed at 650 °C for 3 h in air (Fig. S1a in ESI†).
2.2. Photoelectrochemical test and product analysis
The photoelectrochemical (PEC) behavior of the as-fabricated electrodes was examined in a three-electrode system, with the SCE and Pt foil as the reference and counter electrodes, respectively, using a potentiostat/galvanostat (Ivium) in aqueous potassium bicarbonate (KHCO3, 0.1 M, 99.7%, Aldrich), and purged with high purity CO2 gas (>99.99%) for 1 h prior to and continuously during the PEC test (Fig. S1b†). A simulated solar light (AM 1.5G; 100 mW cm−2) generated from a 150 W xenon arc lamp (ABET technology) was irradiated on the rear side of the electrodes (the side not facing the electrolyte). While irradiating, the potentials swept from +0.4 to −0.5 V vs. the SCE at a scan rate of 1 mV s−1. By using the potentiostat/galvanostat analytical instrument, the potentials with respect to the SCE (VSCE) were converted to those with respect to the reversible hydrogen electrode (VRHE) using the following relationship:VRHE = VSCE + 0.241 + 0.059 × pH.
Notably, the pH of an air-equilibrated bicarbonate (0.1 M) solution is ∼8.2; however, CO2-purging decreases the pH of the bicarbonate solution to ∼6.5. These changes in pH were reflected during the conversion of VSCE to VRHE.
For the stand-alone CO2 conversion and simultaneous water oxidation, sample electrodes were directly wired to a Pt foil placed at a distance of ∼3 mm in a single (non-divided) air-tight glass reactor containing an aqueous bicarbonate solution (0.1 M), and CO2 was purged for 1 h prior to or continuously during irradiation (Fig. S1c†). No external bias was applied to the couples. While the cell voltages (Ecell) were recorded with a digital multimeter (Agilent 34401A), solution and headspace gases were intermittently sampled and analyzed. The solar-to-formate (STF) energy conversion efficiency was estimated using the following equation:  where ΔG° is the Gibbs free energy for conversion of gaseous CO2 to liquid formate (270.14 kJ mol−1) and Ptotal is the power of incident light (100 mW cm−2). ΔG° was estimated based on the following chemical reaction: CO2(g) + H2O(l) → HCOOH(l) + 0.5O2(g).
For the analysis of products, we initially examined the sample solutions using gas chromatography mass spectroscopy (GC-MS, Agilent 7890 and MSD-5975C) and did not observe methanol and formaldehyde. The headspace gases were then analyzed by GC-TCD (Agilent 7820) and GC-FID (Young Lin ACME 6100 and Agilent 7820); however, H2, CO, and CH4 were not observed (or below the detection limit, if produced). Molecular oxygen (O2) was found to be the sole measurable product in the headspace and was quantified using GC-TCD (Agilent 7820). In the solution phase, formate was identified as the sole chemical, and it was quantified using both high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC, Young Lin 9100) and ion chromatography (IC, Dionex ICS-1100). For the HPLC analysis, a mixed eluent constituted of distilled water and phosphoric acid (0.1 vol%, 85–90%, Aldrich) was flown through a C18-inverse column (4.6 mm × 150 mm, Thermo) at 1 mL min−1. In the IC analysis, a mixed eluent made of Na2CO3 (3.5 mM, IC grade, Aldrich) and NaHCO3 (1 mM, IC grade, Aldrich) was flown through a Dionex IonPac AS 14 (4 mm × 250 mm) column.
The conversion of CO2 gas to formate was confirmed by isotope tests using a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer (Avance III 500 MHz, Bruker). Two separate experiments were carried out in 13CO2 (99 atomic% 13C, Aldrich)-purged bicarbonate (0.1 M) and 13CO2-purged 13C-labelled bicarbonate (HO13COO−, 0.1 M, 98 atomic%, Aldrich) solutions for 13C-NMR analyses. During the course of the reactions, a fraction of the solution (0.4 mL) was intermittently sampled and mixed with a deuterium oxide (D2O, 99.9%, Aldrich) solution (1 mL) in an NMR tube (Norell, 5 mm-ultra precision). The amounts of 13C-formate were estimated by comparing the peak areas found at 171 (13C-formate) and 161 ppm (13C-bicarbonate; estimated to be 50 μmol by the equation: 0.1 mol L−1 × 0.05 L × 1%). This quantification method for 13C-formate was reliable due to the insignificant Nuclear Overhauser Effect and widely employed as an NMR quantification technique.21
2.3. Surface characterization and time-resolved photoluminescence analysis
Samples were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku D/Max-2500), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, VG scientific, ESCA LAB 220i XL) using the Mg Kα line (1253.6 eV), and Auger spectroscopy (Cu LMM; XPS, ULVAC-PHI, PHI 700) using the Al Kα line (1486.6 eV) to examine their crystal structure, the binding states of the constituent elements, and the oxidation states of Cu, respectively. A field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, Hitachi S-4800) was also employed to analyze the morphology of the samples. The cross-sectional morphology and composition of CuFeO2/CuO were analyzed by using a focused ion beam (FIB; Hitachi, NB-5000) and high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM, Hitachi, HF-3300) equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectrometer. Nickel grid (Ted Pella, Inc., Pelco 200 mesh, 3.0 mm O.D.) was used for the TEM analysis. Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) lifetime decays were measured using an inverted-type scanning confocal microscope (MicroTime-200, Picoquant, Germany) with a 20× objective. A single-mode pulsed diode laser (470 nm with a pulse width of ∼100 ps and a laser power of ∼30 μW) was used as the excitation source. A dichroic mirror (490 DCXR, AHF), a longpass filter (HQ 500 LQ, AHF), and an avalanche photodiode detector (PDM series, MPD) were used to collect emissions from the samples. A time-correlated single-photon counting technique was used to obtain fluorescence decay curves with a time resolution of 4 ps. Exponential modeling of the obtained fluorescence decays was performed by iterative least-squares deconvolution fitting using the SymPhoTime software (version 5.3). TRPL spectral measurements were performed at the Korea Basic Science Institute (KBSI), Daegu Center, Korea.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Synthesis of bilayered photocatalyst films
DMSO was employed as the electrodeposition (ED) solvent for copper and iron, according to the literature.22 The sample, deposited for 30 min and annealed at 650 °C for 3 h, exhibited an onset potential of ∼+0.85 V and generated dark currents at E < +0.4 V (Fig. 1a). An increase in the ED time to 1 h enhanced the photocurrent; however, a further increase to 2 h led to insignificant changes in both the photocurrent and onset potential. When water was used as an alternative ED solvent, the as-synthesized samples showed onset potentials of ca. +0.93 V, while the photocurrents were significantly larger than those of the DMSO-based samples. The water-based sample displayed the XRD pattern of CuFeO2 (012, etc.; JCPDS no. 01-074-3354) and CuO (e.g., 110, 111, 020, 220, etc.; JCPDS no. 01-089-5896) mixed oxides, and the same pattern was found for the DMSO-based sample (Fig. 1b). On the other hand, the morphology of both samples was significantly different. The DMSO-based sample (ED-2 h) showed an approximately 550 nm-thick underlayer and ∼100 nm-thick overlayer (the bottom-most layer of ∼50 nm thickness was FTO) (Fig. 1c). The overlayer was composed of a number of ∼100 nm-sized spherical particles, the morphology of which was quite different from that of the underlayer (Fig. 1d). The water-based sample showed a similar yet more distinctive double-layer structure (Fig. 1e). While the 500 nm-thick underlayer was uniformly formed, a 5–7 μm-thick porous overlayer with many aggregates composed of ∼100 nm particles was created (Fig. 1f) under the same ED conditions (ED-2 h). The thick layer of the water-based sample, therefore, led to a significantly greater extent of absorption (Fig. S2†), although the absorption onsets were similar because of the same crystalline structure (Fig. 1b). In addition, the similar underlayer thickness (500–550 nm) in both DMSO and water-based samples suggests that the initial deposition mechanism is the same. The thin overlayer in the former sample was attributed to the poor conductivity of the pre-deposited underlayer,23 which retards the overlayer film formation. In the presence of water, however, hydrated Cu(II) and Fe(III) cations can electrophoretically approach the underlayer surface that is negatively charged by the applied potential (−0.36 V vs. SCE) and readily take oxygen from the interfacial water (e.g., forming hydrated copper and iron oxides) while they are deposited.

For comparison, the XRD spectrum of FTO (indicated with asterisks) is shown. (c–f) SEM images of cross-sectional views (c and e) and top views (d and f) of CuFeO2/CuO samples electrodeposited in DMSO (c and d) and water (e and f). It should be noted that the scale of (e and f) is different from that of (c and d). 
To gain insight into the film growth mechanism in aqueous solution, various ED times from 10 s to 2 h were applied at a fixed potential (−0.36 V vs. SCE) and the time-profiled currents were compared (Fig. S3†). Regardless of the ED times, the cathodic currents converged on the values of 2–2.5 mA immediately after the ED initiation (∼3 s) (Fig. S3† inset). We further analyzed the cross-sectional and top views of the samples deposited from 10 s to 10 min (Fig. 2; see Fig. S4† for more images). A ∼500 nm-thick underlayer was quickly created within 10 s and then maintained without further increase in the thickness for the following several minutes (Fig. 2b and S3†). On the other hand, the top view morphology of the ED-1 min sample was different from that of the ED-10 s sample, suggesting that the ED still continues. After 5 min, porous bumps of ∼500 nm with an inter-distance of ∼500 nm were created on the underlayer. The configuration of the bumps was similar to that of the ED-2 h sample (Fig. 2cvs.1e). As the ED continued for 10 min, the bumps filled the underlayer surface and were connected to each other, transforming into a porous layer structure. This bump-layer creation cycle continued during the whole ED period, thus leading to a 5–7 μm-thick porous overlayer with a number of aggregates (Fig. 1e and f). The three-dimensional structure obtained in the water-based sample is favored over the two-dimensional structure in terms of absorption of incident and/or reflected photons (Fig. S2†), and the enlarged solid/liquid interface (Fig. 2). A photoelectrochemical comparison between DMSO-based and water-based CuFeO2/CuO samples confirms the superior structure of the latter (Fig. S5†).

3.2. Photocatalytic synthesis of formate and simultaneous O2 evolution
The as-fabricated CuFeO2/CuO electrode (water-based sample) was wired to a Pt foil, and the couple was immersed in aqueous bicarbonate solution (0.1 M) purged with high purity CO2 gas (>99.99%) (Fig. 3a). Upon irradiating the CuFeO2/CuO with simulated AM 1.5 light (100 mW cm−2), a cell voltage of ∼200 mV was obtained and maintained over 24 h. During the initial period of 6 h, formate was linearly produced at ∼3.2 μmol h−1, which corresponds to the solar-to-formate (STF) efficiency of ∼1%. Then, the formate production rate slightly decreased to ∼2.6 μmol h−1 (STF efficiency ∼ 0.8%) during the last 6 h. When this couple was tested in an outdoor field for two consecutive days, formate was linearly produced under sunlight (Fig. S6†). As compared to the case of simulated light (AM 1.5; 100 mW cm−2) (Fig. 3a), the reduced production of formate was attributed to the low, varying intensity of sunlight. Furthermore, when a free CuFeO2/CuO (e.g., not wired to the Pt foil) was irradiated with the simulated light, the formate production was significantly reduced by ∼70% (STFs ∼ max. 0.3%) (Fig. S7†). This suggests that the wired transfer of holes from CuFeO2/CuO is critical to achieving the efficient electron transfer to CO2 on the same photocatalyst.
 Fig. 3  (a) Stand-alone formate production from CO2 and water on an irradiated CuFeO2/CuO film. CuFeO2/CuO was synthesized via electrodeposition of aqueous Cu and Fe for 2 h, followed by annealing at 650 °C in air for 3 h. The as-synthesized sample was simply wired to a Pt foil at a distance of ∼3 mm, and the couple was immersed in an aqueous bicarbonate solution (0.1 M) purged with CO2 (or 13CO2; see (b and c)) for 1 h. While irradiating the sample with an AM 1.5 light (100 mW cm−2), the cell voltage (Ecell) of the couple was recorded with a multimeter, and the molecular oxygen produced from the Pt foil was quantified (inset). Solar-to-formate (STF) energy efficiency was estimated based on the ratio of chemical energy of formate and incident light energy. The inset shows the simultaneous productions of formate and O2 in the initial stage (∼10 h). (b and c) 13C-NMR spectra and H-NMR spectra, respectively, for 13C-formate (H13COO−) produced for 24 h. 
To confirm the CO2 conversion to formate, 13C-labelled CO2 gas (13CO2) was purged to bicarbonate (HCO3−) solutions and the aforementioned photocatalysis with CuFeO2/CuO and Pt couples was performed. The obtained 13C-NMR spectrum displayed two shifts at ∼171 and ∼161 ppm (Fig. 3b). The former could be attributed to 13C-formate (H13CO2−) produced from 13CO2, and the latter originated from 13C-bicarbonate (H13CO3−) inherently present in bicarbonate (0.1 M, 50 mL) due to the natural abundance of 13C (∼1%). Whereas the intensity of the latter was invariable, that of the former increased with the irradiation time. Accordingly, the amount of 13C-formate increased with time, reaching ∼57 and ∼60 μmol (within ±10%) in non-labeled bicarbonate solutions in 24 h (two separate experiments were performed) (Fig. 3a). These values were similar to the amounts of formate (HCO2−) quantified via chromatography. H-NMR spectra for 13C-formate further showed the gradual increase in doublet shifts at ∼8.56 and ∼8.17 ppm (1JCH = 195 Hz) (Fig. 3c), confirming the formate production from CO2. On comparing, the formate produced in the CO2-purged 13C-bicarbonate (H13CO3−) solution displayed a single shift at 8.26 ppm that became more pronounced with the irradiation time (Fig. S8†), indicating the production of 12C-formate.
In an additional set of identical experiments, the headspace O2 was also quantified. As shown in the inset of Fig. 3a, the measurable O2 evolution began ∼2 h later than the formate production, presumably due to the induction time for the O2 bubble formation and/or kinetically sluggish water oxidation (see R4 in Scheme S1†). However, the production rate of formate and O2 during an initial period of 6 h became 2:1 (3.2 and 1.6 μmol h−1, respectively), indicating that formate production (R5) and O2 evolution (R4) occur simultaneously in a stoichiometric ratio. The O2 evolution continued over 24 h; however, the rate decreased significantly (Fig. S9†). This decrease resulted most likely from the competitive oxidation of the accumulated formate on the Pt foil because formate is much more oxidizable than water (E°(CO2/HCOOH) = 0.026 V). When the CuFeO2/CuO electrode and Pt foil were separated by a proton-exchange membrane, the amounts of formate and O2 were increased by >2 times and the ratio of their production rates was ∼2.4 (the ratio in a single cell reactor ∼4).20 This indicates that in the single cell reactor, approximately 50% of the generated formate was decomposed on the Pt foil while more than 50% of the generated O2 was reduced on the photocathode. Accordingly, the competitive oxidation of formate in the single cell reactor is presumed to lead to a small Ecell of ∼200 mV. For comparison, CuFeO2, CuO, and Cu2O were tested in the same experimental configuration. However, the amounts of formate with CuFeO2 and CuO were only one-sixth and one-third, respectively, of that with CuFeO2/CuO. No measurable amount of formate was obtained with Cu2O, while O2 did not evolve with any of them.
Such an outstanding performance of CuFeO2/CuO can be attributed to the suitable band alignments of CuFeO2 and CuO (Scheme S1†). CuFeO2 was reported to have several direct and indirect band transitions,24–26 some of which can work as trap sites and lead to recombination. Upon coupling with CuO, however, the trapped electrons are effectively quenched by the holes at the CuO valence band located ∼0.12 V higher compared to CuFeO2, while the electron transfer cascade occurs from CuFeO2 to CuO, and to CO2. If the valence band level of CuO is quite close to that of CuFeO2, the cascaded charge transfer can occur as well, enhancing the overall photocatalytic performance (Scheme S1d†). To examine such enhanced charge transfer, the time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) decays and two-dimensional PL (2D-PL) lifetime images were obtained for CuFeO2/CuO (excited at λ = 470 nm) and further compared with those of CuFeO2, CuO, and Cu2O (Fig. 4).27 The decay lifetime (τ) of CuFeO2 was measured to be ∼0.23 ns, and Cu2O showed a similar τ value (0.22 ns). Their 2D-PL lifetime images were rather bright; yet the brightness was highly delocalized. On the other hand, CuFeO2/CuO exhibited an average τ of ∼0.16 ns, to which a short transfer pathway (τ1 = 0.034 ns) contributed predominantly (∼80%). In addition, its 2D-PL lifetime image was dark and spatially uniform. The decay profile of CuO is quite similar to that of CuFeO2/CuO; however, the average lifetime and the component lifetimes (τ1 and τ1) are longer. These comparisons clearly reveal that the coupling between CuFeO2 and CuO facilitates the charge transfer, and the resulting enhanced charge transfer kinetics are delocalized on the surface.

3.3. Durability and recyclability of the photocatalyst
To examine the durability of CuFeO2/CuO, CO2 photoconversion experiments were performed continuously over 30 d, while the amount of formate and the Ecell value were intermittently measured. As shown in Fig. 5a, formate was linearly produced for 17 d at the rate of 35 μmol per day, whereas the initial cell voltage of ∼250 mV gradually decreased during the same period. The obtained formate production rate was similar to the rate based on 7 d (∼36 μmol per day) reported elsewhere.20 However, the 7 d and 17 d-based rates are only ∼60% of the rate obtained on the first day (∼60 μmol per day; see Fig. 3a). This indicates that CuFeO2/CuO gradually loses its photocatalytic activity while the accumulated formate is oxidized on the Pt anode. The abrupt, substantial decrease in the Ecell starting from the 22nd day is attributed to the peeling of the photocatalyst film from the substrate.
 Fig. 5  (a) Stand-alone formate production from CO2 and water on an irradiated CuFeO2/CuO film wired to a Pt plate under continuous irradiation of an AM 1.5 light for 31 d. The cell voltage (Ecell) of the couple was simultaneously recorded. The experimental conditions were identical to those in Fig. 3a. (b–d) Surface analyses ((b) XRD, (c) XPS, and (d) XPS Cu LMM) of the as-synthesized CuFeO2/CuO (fresh) and used in the photocatalysis for certain periods (1 and 7 d). In (b), asterisks refer to the XRD peaks originating from the FTO substrate. In (c), the XPS Cu 2p spectra are resolved into CuO, Cu2O, and CuFeO2. In (d), the Cu LMM spectra of the as-synthesized Cu2O, CuO and CuFeO2, and commercial Cu metal (Cu0 foil) are shown for comparison. 
To identify the reason for the activity decrease, the changes in the crystalline structure and the chemical state of the used samples were examined. The XRD pattern of a fresh sample exhibited peaks due to the crystalline phases of CuFeO2 (012 at 2θ = 35.70°) and CuO (e.g., 110 at 2θ = 32.52° and 111 at 2θ = 38.72°) (Fig. 5b). With the samples used for 1 d and 7 d, most of the CuO peaks (110, 111, −202, and 020) and the representative CuFeO2 peak (012) weakened, whereas Cu2O peaks (110, 111, and 200) were newly found. This suggests that CuO was gradually reduced to Cu2O, while CuFeO2 underwent decomposition during prolonged photocatalysis (e.g., R6 and R7). The absence of metallic Cu peaks (e.g., 2θ = 43.3, 50.3, and 74.2°) further indicates that the reduction of CuO and Cu2O to Cu0 did not occur.28 It should be noted that the CuO peak (202 at 58.26°) grows as photocatalysis continues, attributed presumably to the photodecomposition of CuFeO2 (R7).
According to XPS analyses, the Cu2p binding energy (∼932.6 eV) of the as-synthesized sample decreased by 0.4 eV after 1 week of use because of the reduction of Cu(II) to Cu(I) (Fig. 5c). The contributions of the Cu(II) and Cu(I) states were estimated by deconvoluting the Cu2p bands, assuming that the Cu(II) states resulted solely from CuO (933.2 eV), and the Cu(I) states originated from Cu2O (932 eV) and CuFeO2 (932.4 eV). Within the as-synthesized sample, CuO and CuFeO2 were found to exist in the ratio of 61:39. In the case of the sample used for 1 week, an additional Cu2O peak was identified, leading to the CuO:CuFeO2:Cu2O ratio of 38:15:47. On the other hand, the XPS Fe2p spectrum shows that the Fe(III)-associated band at ∼710 eV in the fresh sample significantly diminished, whereas a new band (∼716 eV) associated with Fe(II) appeared in the used sample. The presence of Fe(II) supports the decomposition pathway of CuFeO2 speculated (R7) via the above XRD analysis. However, the absence of Fe(II)-associated oxides in the XRD spectrum suggests that Fe(II) oxides are non-crystalline and/or traces. It is noteworthy that in the deconvolution of the Cu2p bands, we excluded the possible contribution of Cu0 because of the absence of the metallic Cu peak in the XRD pattern. This was further confirmed by the XPS spectra of Cu LMM Auger transition (Fig. 5d). The as-synthesized CuFeO2/CuO sample showed a kinetic energy peak at 917.3 eV, whereas the peak of CuFeO2/CuO used for 1 week shifted to 916.2 eV. The energy value of the latter was similar to those of Cu2O and CuFeO2, whereas CuO and metallic Cu (Cu0 foil) exhibited higher kinetic energies for Cu.29 Accordingly, the oxidation states of Cu in the used sample were obviously Cu(I) and Cu(II), not Cu0.
To address the challenge of these structural changes and to restore the original states, we adopted a straightforward and highly applicable strategy. As shown in Fig. 6a, the as-synthesized CuFeO2/CuO produces formate, ∼240 μmol in 7 d (34.3 μmol per day), while the Ecell decreases by ∼60 mV. Then, the used sample was annealed at 650 °C for 3 h in the presence of atmospheric air (e.g., identical to the synthesis conditions) and reused for CO2 photoconversion. A similar amount of formate (∼250 μmol) was produced on the recycled sample while the Ecell decreased by ∼60 mV during a period of 1 week (e.g., second week). Even when the photocatalysis/annealing cycle was repeated four times, the formate production rates were virtually unchanged. To further confirm the recyclability, the XRD patterns of the recycled samples were compared (Fig. 6b and S10†). It is obvious that all the recycled samples exhibited a pattern of the crystalline structure identical to that of the as-synthesized one, while only minor variations in the relative peak intensities were observed. It appears that the oxidative annealing oxidizes Cu2O to CuO, while copper and iron species (e.g., cupric/cuprous oxides and ferrous oxides), which are produced from the photodecomposition of CuFeO2 (R7), thermally recreate CuFeO2.
 Fig. 6  (a) Photocatalytic synthesis of formate on CuFeO2/CuO (coupled to a Pt foil). After being used for the first 7 d, an as-synthesized photocatalyst (fresh) was annealed at 650 °C for 3 h in the presence of atmospheric air (e.g., identical to the synthesis conditions) and recycled for CO2 photoconversion (denoted as first week recycled). This recycling was repeated four times and hence the single photocatalyst sample was used for 5 weeks in total for CO2 conversion under continuous irradiation with an AM 1.5 light. Changes in Ecell are shown as well. (b) XRD spectra of the as-synthesized and recycled CuFeO2/CuO samples. 
4. Conclusions
We have demonstrated that CuFeO2 and CuO mixed binary films selectively produce liquid formate from aqueous CO2, while driving O2 evolution on a wired Pt plate under simulated sunlight at ∼1% efficiency. The as-synthesized photocatalyst films could produce formate continuously over 17 d while undergoing gradual chemical reduction. The used samples were successfully reactivated by annealing in air, and hence, a single photocatalyst sample could produce formate over 35 d through four thermal recycles. The high efficiency was attributed to the suitable match of energy levels between CuFeO2 and CuO, leading to an ultrafast charge transfer in the film where CO2 was adsorbed. The photocatalyst components (Cu, Fe, and O) are earth-abundant, while the photocatalyst synthesis is straightforward, facile, environmentally benign, reproducible, and scalable. It is evident that if a higher efficiency could be achieved in the near future, the practical applicability of these photocatalysts would be enormous.
