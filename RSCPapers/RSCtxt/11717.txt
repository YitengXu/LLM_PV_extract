    , Accepted 14th April 2015First published on 6th May 2015AbstractUltrathin two-dimensional (2D) semiconductor nanocrystals have attracted much attention of late due to their attractive functional properties. Concurrently, oriented-attachment (OA) growth has been considered as an important growth theory for the construction of various nanocrystals, especially ultrathin 2D nanocrystals. However, all the OA growth procedures reported in the preparation of nanocrystals have been driven by organic ligand molecules so far. In this paper, we report for the first time that a metal ion controlled OA growth to synthesize semiconductor nanocrystals: 2D β-In2S3 nanobelts and nanoflakes with ∼2 nm thickness can be achieved via OA controlled by Ca2+ and Al3+, respectively. Note that Ca2+ and Al3+ are not incorporated into the crystal lattice structure of β-In2S3. β-In2S3 nanobelts and nanoflakes show step-like absorptions in UV-visible spectra. Furthermore, β-In2S3 nanoflakes exhibit the most outstanding photoelectrochemical activity when compared with β-In2S3 nanoparticles and nanobelts.
Introduction
Along with the discovery of graphene,1,2 ultrathin two-dimensional (2D) semiconductor nanostructures—including nanosheets, nanodisks, nanoplates, nanobelts and nanoflakes—have attracted much attention due to their promising properties. For example, CdE (E = S, Se, Te), MoS2, WS2, and ZnSe 2D nanocrystals with a few-atomic layer thickness have been actively studied for a variety of applications, such as light-emitting diodes, optoelectronic devices, solar energy conservation and photocatalysis.3–11
To achieve these advances, many physical and chemical methods have been devoted to the synthesis of various 2D semiconductor ultrathin nanomaterials. Some of these methods are the exfoliation of layered materials, the lamellar soft template strategy, oriented attachment (OA) of building blocks and organic-ligand guidance.7,12–19 Among them, OA growth has now become a major research focus in the preparation of ultrathin 2D nanocrystals.20,21 In classic theories of nanocrystal growth, the shape of a nanocrystal is controlled by the relative surface energies of different crystalline facets, such that higher-energy facets grow faster. Different to the classic theories, the OA growth demonstrated by Penn and Banfield is initially based on the separation of nucleation and the subsequent growth process, and suggests a new crystal growth mechanism involving the attachment of two or more nanocrystals, followed by the sharing of a common crystallographic orientation and the joining of planar interfaces.22 In such a process, organic ligand molecules generally play a crucial role in triggering the OA by capping nanoparticle surfaces selectively.15,20,21,23–29 For example, Weller's group synthesized PbS nanosheets through OA growth driven by oleic acid and chlorine-containing co-solvents (linear chloroalkanes).15 Very recently, Wan's group reported solvent-induced OA growth of FeS2 nanocrystals.25 We also reported octylamine driven OA growth to synthesize GdF3 ultrathin nanowires.26,27
Metal ions have also been shown to be efficient directors of nanocrystal morphology, especially where metal nanoparticles are concerned. A particularly illustrative example is Pt-based nanocubes. Pt nanocubes have been produced by tungsten, iron, cobalt, and chromium carbonyls, as well as iron chloride, silver nitrate and silver acetylacetonate.30–36 The Cabot group reported an example of foreign metal ions that influence the morphology of chalcogenide semiconductor CuxSe to change from nanoparticles to nanocubes.37 However, all of these examples are based on classic growth theories of nanocrystals: metal ions manipulating the nucleation and growth rate of nanocrystals in different crystallographic directions. Until now, there have been no studies available on metal ions influencing the OA growth to control the nanocrystal morphology.
As one of the most important III–VI semiconductor nanomaterials, indium sulfide (In2S3) has been widely studied as it is a lucrative material for catalysis, photovoltaics, and solar cells along with other optoelectronic device based applications.38,39 In2S3 has a large exciton Bohr diameter of 33.8 nm which makes it a potential material for the fundamental study of size confinement effects in different shapes and sizes.40 In2S3 is known to exist in three different crystalline forms as a function of temperature: α-In2S3 (defect cubic), β-In2S3 (defect spinel), and γ-In2S3 (layered structure). Of these, β-In2S3 is an n-type semiconductor with a band gap of 2.0–2.3 eV and is a potential candidate for photocatalytic applications because of its suitable band gap for solar energy conversion.41 Until now, various β-In2S3 nanocrystals including 2D nanosheets and nanobelts have been prepared successfully.39,42–46 However, there are few reports on the synthesis of β-In2S3 controlled by metal ions, or the effect of the 2D nanostructure on the photoelectrochemical (PEC) activity of β-In2S3.
In this article, we report an example of using metal ions to control OA growth to prepare ultrathin 2D nanocrystals for the first time. Nanobelts and nanoflakes of β-In2S3 with a thickness of ∼2 nm were controllably prepared via OA growth, where Ca2+ and Al3+ played crucial roles along with n-octylamine, respectively. However, the metal ions were not incorporated into the crystal lattice of β-In2S3. In contrast, without using metal ions, β-In2S3 nanoparticles were obtained. These processes are illustrated in Scheme 1. Furthermore, the prepared 2D β-In2S3 nanobelts and nanoflakes were investigated in PEC water splitting with the comparison of β-In2S3 nanoparticles.

Experimental section
Chemicals
Indium(III) nitrate tetrahydrate (reagent grade, 99%), n-octylamine (99% mass fraction), thioacetamide (TAA, 99%), and sulfur (powder, 99.5%) were purchased from J&K Scientific Ltd. Calcium chloride (98%, anhydrous) and calcium nitrate (99%, anhydrous) were obtained from Beijing chemical factory. Aluminum nitrate nonahydrate (99%, AR) was provided by Tianjin institute of fine chemicals. Aluminum chloride (GR, 99.9%) was purchased from Xiya Chemical Industry Co. Ltd., Shandong. Chloroform and cyclohexane were of analytical grade and obtained from Tianjin Guangfu Co. Ltd. All chemicals were used as received without further purification.
Synthesis of β-In2S3 nanobelts
In a typical procedure to prepare β-In2S3 nanobelts, indium nitrate tetrahydrate (0.0764 g, 0.2 mmol) and 5.0 mL octylamine were added to 10.0 mL cyclohexane in a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave with a capacity of 20 mL at room temperature, and stirred for 10 minutes. Moreover, thioacetamide (0.0225 g, 0.3 mmol) and sulfur powder (0.0070 g, 0.2 mmol) were added to the above solution. Then, calcium chloride (0.011 g, 0.1 mmol) was added to the precursor solution. The obtained precursor solution was stirred for 5 minutes, again. After the autoclave was sealed and maintained at 150 °C for 4 h in a preheated oven, it was taken out and cooled to room temperature. Yellow products were collected after being repeatedly washed with absolute ethanol and chloroform, and then dried in a vacuum oven. Then the obtained sample was re-dispersed in cyclohexane (∼5 mL) and stored until its further use.
Synthesis of β-In2S3 nanoflakes
Ultrathin 2D β-In2S3 nanoflakes were prepared via a similar method except for adding Al3+ (aluminum nitrate nonahydrate, 0.1 mmol) instead of Ca2+ to the precursor solution.
Synthesis of β-In2S3 nanoparticles
β-In2S3 nanoparticles were prepared via a similar method without adding Ca2+ (calcium chloride) or Al3+ (aluminum nitrate nonahydrate) into the precursor solution.
Characterization
Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected on a Rigaku D/Max 2200 PC diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) and a graphite monochromator from 20° to 70° with a scanning rate of 5.0° per min. Accurate scanning was performed from 45° to 51° at a scanning rate of 0.2° per min. Unit cell dimensions were determined using the JADE 5 program for X-ray diffraction pattern processing, identification, and quantification. The size and morphology of the obtained β-In2S3 samples were characterized on a transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEM100-CXII) equipped with a selected area electron diffractometer (SAED). The structure and lattice fringes of nanocrystals were observed by using a high resolution TEM (HRTEM, FEI Tecnai G2 F30) equipped with a scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses were performed to characterize the components and surface of the nanocrystals. The XPS spectra were recorded on a PHI-5300 ESCA spectrometer (Perkin-Elmer) with its energy analyzer working in the pass energy mode at 35.75 eV, and the Al Kα line was used as the excitation source. After subtraction of X-ray satellites and inelastic background (Shirley-type), peak deconvolution was carried out. The obtained XPS information was based on the C–C standard peak (284.6 eV). The chemical composition of the as-prepared nanobelts and nanoflakes was analyzed by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX, Oxford). To gain a better understanding of the elemental distribution throughout these nanocrystals, the prepared β-In2S3 samples were characterized using high-angle annular dark field-scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM) imaging in conjunction with EDX mapping. The UV-vis absorption spectra properties of all the samples were investigated under a UV–vis spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV–vis 2550).
Fabrication of photoelectrochemical (PEC) working electrodes
Fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrates (1 cm × 2 cm) were cleaned with acetone and deionized water, and dried with pure nitrogen. To prepare a PEC device, an active layer was prepared by spin-coating β-In2S3 nanoparticles, β-In2S3 nanobelts and β-In2S3 nanoflakes dispersed in cyclohexane (1 mL with a concentration of 0.5 mg mL−1) onto the FTO layer at 3000 rpm. Finally, the obtained product was annealed in a nitrogen environment at 60 °C for 1 h before it was used for the water splitting experiment.
PEC water splitting
PEC tests were conducted using a three-electrode configuration (purified with N2) connected to a CHI 660D workstation (CH Instruments) at about 25 °C employing an epoxy-sealed β-In2S3 nanocrystal sample with an exposed area of 1.0 cm2 as the working electrode, the Pt mesh as the counter electrode, Ag/AgCl (3 mol L−1 KCl-filled) as the reference electrode, and 0.5 M NaOH (pH, 13.7) solution as the electrolyte. A 350 W Xe lamp light source (at a power density of 80 mW cm−2) was used to provide visible illumination on β-In2S3 nanoparticles/FTO, β-In2S3 nanobelts/FTO, β-In2S3 nanoflakes/FTO. The illumination power on the sample was adjusted from 80, 50 to 10 mW cm−2, and measured by using a LP-3A laser power meter. In the chemical stability tests, the amperometric I–t data were acquired at 0.22 V vs. Ag/AgCl. The thermodynamic potential for water oxidation was determined by the Nernst equation: Eo(O2/H2O) = 1.23–0.05917 × pH = 0.4194 VNHE = 0.2194 VAgCl/Ag. All the measurements were done under ambient conditions.
Results and discussion
Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) was used to characterize the phase and crystallization of the obtained products. Fig. 1a shows the powder XRD patterns of three as-prepared samples (nanobelts, nanoflakes and nanoparticles). All three patterns match well with the cubic crystal structure of β-In2S3 (JCPDS card no. 32-0456) with the Fdm space group. No characteristic peaks were observed for impurities such as In2O3, InS and In(OH)3. The lower intensity and broader width of the diffraction peaks in the XRD patterns should be related to the smaller size effect of the obtained β-In2S3 nanobelts and nanoflakes. Fig. 1b depicts the precise scan patterns of (440) peaks between 45 and 51° of the three as-prepared samples. It shows that the peaks did not shift when Ca2+ or Al3+ ions were added into the reaction solution, indicating that Ca2+ and Al3+ ions were not incorporated into the crystal lattice of β-In2S3. It was further confirmed by energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectra in Fig. S1 (ESI†). This result is similar to the previous report of metal ions controlling CuxSe nanocubes via the classic growth theories of nanocrystals, in which Al3+ ions were not incorporated too.37

The morphology and size of the as-prepared β-In2S3 nanocrystals were observed by using a transmission electron microscope (TEM). The TEM image in Fig. S2 (see ESI†) shows that the β-In2S3 obtained without adding Ca2+ or Al3+ into the precursor solution has the morphology of nanoparticles. In contrast, Fig. 2a shows the TEM images of the β-In2S3 sample synthesized by adding Ca2+ ions into the precursor solution. Careful observation reveals that the obtained 2D β-In2S3 nanomaterials are, in fact, ultrathin nanobelts. The obvious occurrence of creasing or curling (highlighted by white arrows) in the TEM image sufficiently proves that the synthesized nanocrystals are belt-like, rather than wire-like, in shape. The TEM image also reveals that the synthesized nanobelts are ca. 50 nm in width, and that the overall length is up to several hundred nanometers. The inset of Fig. 2a is the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image of the nanobelt standing-edge, and it shows that the belts are ∼2 nm in thickness. The ultrathin thickness of the nanobelts corresponds to a few atomic layers of β-In2S3. Fig. 2b shows the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of the β-In2S3 nanocrystallites. The regular circular diffraction rings indicate that these nanobelts are crystalline β-In2S3 in nature. The typical HRTEM image of a nanobelt (Fig. 2c) shows that two sets of planes with a crossing angle of ∼70° and a distance of 0.30 nm are dominant, corresponding to {222} in cubic β-In2S3. The zone axis is 〈110〉, implying that the exposed crystalline planes of the nanobelts are {110}. To gain a better understanding of the elemental distribution throughout these nanocrystals, the prepared β-In2S3 nanobelts were characterized using high-angle annular dark field-scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM, Fig. 2d) imaging in conjunction with EDX spectroscopy mapping. Elemental mapping reveals that In and S elements were uniformly distributed throughout the β-In2S3 nanobelts, as shown in Fig. 2e and f.

Fig. 3a shows a representative TEM image of the β-In2S3 sample synthesized by adding Al3+ ions into the precursor solution. The obvious occurrence of wrinkling or rolling in the TEM image sufficiently proves that the synthesized nanocrystals are flake-like in shape. The poor contrast of these nanoflakes (despite containing a heavy metal sulfide) further suggests that these flakes are also extremely thin. The standing edges of the flakes in the TEM and HRTEM (inset of Fig. 3a) images show that the flake thickness is also approximately 2 nm. The SAED pattern of the sample (Fig. 3b) indicates that it is crystalline in nature. The HRTEM image (Fig. 3c) clearly reveals two sets of planes with a distance of 0.30 nm and a crossing angle of ∼70°, corresponding to {222} in cubic β-In2S3. Thus, they have the same zone axis as the above nanobelts, demonstrating that the exposed crystalline planes of the nanoflakes are also {110} of cubic β-In2S3. Elemental EDX mapping (in Fig. 3e and f) shows that the monophasic β-In2S3 nanoflakes were elementally homogeneous along the entire nanoflake structure.

The three β-In2S3 samples were also studied using X-ray photoelectron spectrometry (XPS) analysis as shown in Fig. S3 (see ESI†). The survey spectra in Fig. S3a† show In and S elements, as well as O and C in three samples, which came from organic molecules on the surface. As expected, few signals of Al3+ or Ca2+ ions were found in the XPS spectra. The molar ratio of S to In was calculated to be approximately 1:0.7 from the peak areas. These findings were consistent with their element signals, and the stoichiometry was within expected error margins. The high-resolution XPS spectra of In 3d and S 2p were also measured (Fig. S3b and c†). No shift was found for the peaks of In 3d or S 2p in the obtained β-In2S3 nanobelts and nanoflakes, indicating that the valence of In and S did not change. The photoelectron peaks at 452.1 eV and 444.5 eV can be assigned to the 3d3/2 and 3d5/2 binding energies of In3+.47,48 Fig. S3c† also shows the binding energy of S 2p. The deconvoluted binding energies of 161.1 eV and 162.1 eV could be assigned to S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2, indicating the presence of S2−.49 The binding energies of In 3d and S 2p were in accordance with the data reported for β-In2S3.50–52
To determine the influence of Ca2+ and Cl− ions in CaCl2 salt used in the preparation of the β-In2S3 nanobelt during the reaction, contrast experiments were carried out. Fig. 4a shows the TEM image of the product obtained from a reaction with NaCl instead of CaCl2. It shows that no nanobelts were detected, which demonstrates that the Cl− anion was not responsible for the nanobelt formation. However, nanobelts were produced from the reaction with Ca(CH3COO)2, as shown in Fig. 4b. The influence of Al3+ and NO3− ions in Al(NO3)3 salt on the growth of β-In2S3 nanoflakes in the reaction was also studied by contrast experiments. Fig. 4c shows the TEM image of the product obtained from the reaction with NaNO3 instead of Al(NO3)3 salt. It shows that no nanoflakes were detected in the product. However, nanoflakes were produced from the reaction with AlCl3 in the precursor solution, as shown in Fig. 4d. These results indicated that foreign metal ions (Ca2+ and Al3+), rather than anion ions (NO3− and Cl−), caused the changes in the morphology of the nanomaterials—namely, leading (respectively) to the formation of ultrathin 2D β-In2S3 nanobelts and nanoflakes. From the experimental results obtained, it is clear that the Ca2+ and Al3+ ions had a strong influence on the β-In2S3 nanocrystal morphology. Our work also showed that the presence of octylamine and S powder was essential for preparing nanobelts and nanoflakes. It demonstrates that the 2D nanostructures resulted from the interaction between metal ions, octylamine and S powder.
 Fig. 4  TEM images of the β-In2S3 nanocrystals obtained using different salts, as noted. 
To further investigate the growth process of the nanobelts and nanoflakes, TEM images were taken for the samples obtained at different reaction stages, as shown in Fig. 5. In the first 5 min of the reaction, small particles with sizes of ca. 2 nm were produced during the reaction process of the nanobelts and nanoflakes, as shown in Fig. 5a and d, respectively. When the reactions lasted for 30 min, the original nanoparticles can be recognized along with belt-like and flake-like aggregates, as shown in Fig. 5b and e. When the reaction time was increased to 90 min, we observed nanobelts coexisting with some nanoparticles in the sample, as shown in Fig. 5c. Fig. 5f shows that nanoflakes were formed in the sample when the reaction lasted for 90 min. The evolution we witnessed illustrated that the OA growth process accounted for the formation of β-In2S3 nanobelts and nanoflakes. This result was also verified by the traces of OA in the HRTEM images of the primary β-In2S3 particles, nanobelts and nanoflakes (Fig. S4, see ESI†). In contrast, preparation without adding Ca2+ or Al3+ into the precursor solution led to the formation of spherical (or torispherical) β-In2S3 nanoparticles (see Fig. S2 in the ESI†). So, OA could not occur without the presence of Ca2+ or Al3+ ions, illustrating that Ca2+ and Al3+ ions play a crucial role in OA growth in this system.

Based on the above results, it was speculated that Ca2+ and Al3+ ions play a role in controlling the OA evolution of β-In2S3 2D nanostructures. Octylamine molecules were often reported to prefer to adsorb selectively onto special nanocrystal planes.26,28,53 Here, inferred from the HRTEM images (Fig. 2c and 3c), octylamine molecules should selectively adsorb onto the {110} planes of β-In2S3 nanoparticles at the early reaction stage. This enabled the OA growth of β-In2S3 nanoparticles along the 〈001〉 direction. At the same time, metal ions (Ca2+ or Al3+) in the solution could cause some of the octylamine molecules to desorb from partial {110} planes because of the combination between the metal ions (Ca2+ or Al3+) and octylamine. The bare {110} planes produced could promote the OA growth of β-In2S3 nanoparticles along the 〈110〉 direction. Therefore, 2D β-In2S3 nanocrystals were achieved due to the 2D OA growth along 〈001〉 and 〈110〉 directions. This process could be illustrated as a scheme in Fig. 5g. However, because of the much lower atomic potential (Z/r) of Ca2+ than Al3+, Ca2+ metal ions desorbed fewer octylamine molecules from the planes of β-In2S3. This induced the OA growth along the 〈110〉 of β-In2S3 to be much weaker in the Ca2+ solution than that in Al3+ solution. So, the 1D (quasi-2D) growth along 〈001〉 was dominant in the Ca2+ solution; 2D growth along 〈001〉 and 〈110〉 was dominant in the Al3+ solution. This may be the reason why the Ca2+-controlled reaction produced nanobelts but the Al3+-controlled reaction produced nanoflakes.
To investigate the influence of the metal ion concentration on the morphology of the final product, we followed similar procedures but just modifying the amount of CaCl2 and Al(NO3)3·9H2O introduced into the precursor solution. Fig. S5a and b (see ESI†) display the TEM images of the products obtained by adding 0.3 mmol and 0.5 mmol CaCl2 into the precursor solution, respectively. As it can be observed, nanobelts could also be prepared at these CaCl2 concentrations. However, more nanoparticles were detected with the increasing concentration of CaCl2. Fig. S5c and d (see ESI†) display TEM images of the products obtained by adding 0.3 mmol and 0.5 mmol Al(NO3)3·9H2O into the precursor solution, respectively. As it can be seen from the TEM images, 2D β-In2S3 nanoflakes could also be obtained at these concentrations, but their morphologies were worse defined.
The band gap in the visible part of the spectrum makes β-In2S3 a promising material that may have valuable applications in photocatalytic and photoelectric conversion fields.44 In this work, the three prepared β-In2S3 samples in cyclohexane were further characterized by UV-visible absorption spectroscopy, as shown in Fig. 6. Curve a represents the absorption spectrum of the β-In2S3 nanoparticles. It shows a wide band between 320 and 600 nm. Curves b and c are the absorption spectra of the obtained 2D nanobelts and nanoflakes. Comparing these curves to that of β-In2S3 nanoparticles, curve a, the obtained 2D nanobelts and nanoflakes displayed an obvious step-like absorption between 280 and 380 nm. They are very consistent with the characteristic UV-vis absorption spectrum of the reported β-In2S3 with 2D nanostructures, which was identified as an indicator of conduction and valence band transitions in β-In2S3.39,54 This step-like absorption may be related to their 2D nanostructure, in which electrons confined along a specific direction have the staircase density of states (DOS).55,56 In addition, the shoulder peaks at ∼290 nm for both nanobelts and nanoflakes were enhanced in the absorption spectra. Moreover, the shoulder peak in nanobelts blue-shifted slightly compared with that of the nanoflakes, as shown in Fig. 6. This may be caused by the fact that the thickness of the obtained β-In2S3 nanobelts is a bit less than that of the nanoflakes.

As a proof-of-concept application of the as-prepared ultrathin 2D nanocrystals, the obtained β-In2S3 nanobelts and nanoflakes were used in PEC water splitting. For comparison, β-In2S3 nanoparticles were also examined in the PEC test. Under irradiation of a 350 W Xe lamp, electron–hole pairs were generated in β-In2S3. In general, the VB electrons (e−) of β-In2S3 would be excited to the CB and create holes (h+) after absorbing photon energy. The large 2D structure and ultrathin level of thickness would provide more active sites, and a short and convenient pathway for photogenerated electrons and holes to migrate to the reaction sites of the surface.8,57 The applied potential causes the photogenerated electrons to drift toward the Pt mesh electrode, where the reduction of H2O accompanied by H2 evolution occurs. On the other hand, the holes left on the β-In2S3 surface oxidize H2O to produce O2. The PEC performance of the three samples was investigated in a 0.5 M NaOH electrolyte solution using a conventional three-electrode system. All of the samples exhibited an almost negligible dark current in a potential range of −0.2 to 0.7 V vs. Ag/AgCl, suggesting that the observed current stems from light absorption. As shown in Fig. 7a, the photocurrent density of β-In2S3 nanoflakes/FTO PEC at 0.7 V is 370 μA cm−2, which is much higher than that of the pure FTO. Meanwhile, Fig. 7a also shows that the photocurrent densities of β-In2S3 nanobelts/FTO and β-In2S3 nanoparticles/FTO PEC at 0.7 V are 120 μA cm−2 and 20 μA cm−2, respectively. This demonstrates that, of the three samples, the β-In2S3 nanoflakes had the best PEC activity for water splitting. The chemical stability against the anodic oxidation reaction is important for photoanode materials. Fig. 7b displays the photocurrent density vs. time (J–t) curves of β-In2S3 at a constant potential of 0.22 V vs. Ag/AgCl under illumination for 160 min. The results show that the three obtained β-In2S3 samples exhibited high stability for PEC water splitting. As displayed by the amperometric J–t cycles in Fig. 7c, tested with light irradiation (at a power density of 80 mW cm−2) on and off, the current of the devices displays two distinct states: (1) a “low” current state under dark conditions and (2) a “high” current state under light conditions. The switching between these two states was reversible and fast, allowing the device to act as a high-quality photosensitive switch. To further identify the origin of the photocurrent, power dependent photocurrent responses were examined. The photocurrent density of the β-In2S3 nanoflakes increased with the amplification of light power because more photons were absorbed (Fig. 7d). The relationship between the photocurrent and incident optical power densities (Fig. 7e) demonstrates a power dependence of ∼0.30 (that is, I ≈ P0.30), which indicates the excellent efficiency of the as-grown β-In2S3 nanoflakes in capturing photons.58 These results show that the β-In2S3 nanoflakes may have great potential for use in solar water splitting and photoswitching, as well as in photoelectronic devices.

Conclusions
In summary, we demonstrated controlled-synthesis of 2D β-In2S3 nanobelts and nanoflakes via OA growth. We discovered for the first time that metal ions, Ca2+ or Al3+, could play crucial roles in this OA growth process of 2D nanocrystals. The thickness of both as-synthesized β-In2S3 nanobelts and nanoflakes was approximately 2 nm. The XRD and XPS results indicated that Ca2+ and Al3+ ions had not been incorporated into the crystal lattice of β-In2S3. Room-temperature UV-vis spectra revealed that β-In2S3 nanobelts and nanoflakes demonstrated a step-like absorption band and exhibited a strong quantum confinement effect. Furthermore, our results revealed that the synthesized ultrathin 2D β-In2S3 nanoflakes showed superior PEC water-splitting activity compared to nanobelts and nanoparticles. The techniques and concepts we explored in this research may be of help for the development of OA growth theories as well as the potential use of ultrathin 2D β-In2S3 nanocrystals.
