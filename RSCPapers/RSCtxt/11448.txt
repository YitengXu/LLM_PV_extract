    , Accepted 17th January 2023First published on 2nd February 2023AbstractJanus materials possess some unique properties that are different from those of a symmetrical structure, which provides them with broad application prospects. In this work, we investigated the photocatalytic and piezoelectric properties of Janus materials Al2XYZ (X/Y/Z = S, Se, Te, X ≠ Y ≠ Z) by first-principles calculations. The results show that Janus monolayers Al2XYZ, with energy, mechanical, thermal, and dynamical stability, have suitable band-edge positions, broad absorption of sunlight (infrared–ultraviolet), high solar-to-hydrogen (STH) efficiency (up to 23.81%) and high carrier transfer in the x-direction (1 × 104 cm2 V−1 s−1). In addition, the photocatalytic water decomposition reaction of the Al2SeTeS monolayer can be carried out spontaneously under an applied potential. The Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio indicated that the Al2XYZ monolayers possess extraordinary flexibility. The in-plane d11 and the out-of-plane piezoelectric coefficient d31 are up to 41.28 pm V−1 and 0.32 pm V−1. Notably, the in-plane piezoelectric coefficient d11 and the out-of-plane d31 are highly adjustable by applying strain/stacking. For Al2SeTeS, they increased by approximately one order of magnitude (d11: from 41.28 pm V−1 to 405.63 pm V−1, d31: from 0.07 pm V−1 to 0.44 pm V−1). These outstanding properties allow Al2XYZ monolayers to be widely used in photocatalysis, flexible nanodevices and piezoelectric sensors.
1. Introduction
Two-dimensional (2D) Janus materials1,2 which break mirror symmetry have attracted more and more attention in recent years due to their unique properties,3–6 such as strong Rashba spin splitting, vertical dipole moment, light absorption capability, out-of-plane piezoelectric polarization and enhanced gas sensitivity. So far, a large number of Janus materials have been studied and applied in various fields, for example, electronic thin films,7 surfactants,8 sensors,9 solar-cell devices,10 electronic skin pressure sensors,11 drug delivery,12 and biomimetic interfaces.13,14
Recently, 2D Janus materials have been proven to be potential water separation photocatalysts because of their suitable band-edge position, rapid migration of photogenerated electrons and holes, high specific surface area and enhanced gas sensitivity caused by an inherent electric field.15–17 Zhao et al. explored the relationship between the redox potential and the band-edge position of Janus material WXY (X/Y is O, S, Se or Te). They found that it has remarkable photocatalytic potential.18 Yang et al. calculated the Gibbs free energy change of the HfSe/InSe heterostructure, which confirmed the thermodynamic feasibility of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER).19 Due to the wide range of light absorption, Ma et al. found that the Janus monolayer MoSSe is a highly efficient photocatalyst.20 Yang et al. found that XBiSe3 (X = As, Sb) monolayers can also participate in photocatalytic water decomposition under strain engineering, indicating that XBiSe3 has broad application prospects in the field of photocatalysis.21 It is reported that the Janus material In2X2X′ (X and X′ = S, Se, or Te) monolayer is an excellent photocatalytic material with high photocatalytic efficiency.22 In addition, many 2D Janus materials, such as Janus Pd4S3Se3, Pd4S3Te3, and Pd4Se3Te3,23 PtSSe,17 PdSSe,24 AlBiX3 (X = S, Se, Te)25 and Ag2X (X = S, Se)26 have also been theoretically predicted. The results demonstrated that these 2D Janus materials could be candidates for photocatalytic water decomposition catalysts.
In addition to being candidates for photocatalysts, the lack of inversion symmetry of 2D Janus materials gives them larger out-of-plane and in-plane piezoelectric properties. They are superior to traditional 2D materials whose piezoelectric properties are limited to the basal plane. Qiu et al. found both in-plane and out-of-plane piezoelectric properties of Sb2Se2Te, Sb2Te2Se, and three structures of SbAsSe2Te monolayers show great advantages.27 A series of investigations on Janus materials α-In2X3,28 M2SeX (M = Ge, Sn; X = S, Te),29 SnXY (X = O, S, Se, Te; Y = O, S, Se, Te; X ≠ Y),30 AlBX2 (X = O, S, Se, Te),31 and F–M–H (M = B, Al, and Ga)32 also proved that 2D Janus materials have high in-plane and out-of-plane piezoelectric coefficients. Recent studies have shown that the piezoelectric properties of 2D materials can be adjusted by a small strain and the stacking of layers.33–35 For example, Qiu et al. also found that the piezoelectric coefficient of 2D LiAlTe236 increases when uniaxial strains are applied. Multilayer materials C3N4,37 Te2Se38 and α-In2Se339 have proved that the number of layers can adjust the piezoelectric coefficient.
Inspired by the unique structure of 2D Janus materials, we have predicted the properties of 2D Janus Al2XYZ (X/Y/Z = S, Se, Te, X ≠ Y ≠ Z) monolayers. The electronic, mechanical, photocatalytic, and piezoelectric properties of all the Al2XYZ monolayers are calculated in this work. We find that the Al2XYZ monolayers have suitable band-edge positions, high energy conversion efficiencies, fast transfer of carriers and strong visible light absorption, which allows them to be used as photocatalysts in the field of water decomposition. In addition, first-principles calculations also show that Janus Al2XYZ monolayers have excellent flexibility, which gives them large in-plane and out-of-plane piezoelectric responses. The piezoelectric properties are highly adjustable with strain and multilayer stacking. Therefore, Janus Al2XYZ monolayers have fascinating potential in the solar photolysis of water to hydrogen and piezoelectric electronic devices.
2. Computational methods
All the calculations are performed using VASP 5.4.4 (Vienna ab Initio Simulation Package) based on density functional theory (DFT),40,41 and the crystal structure and charge density distribution are described by VESTA software.42 The ion–electron interaction uses the projection-enhanced plane-wave (PAW) method.42 The electron–electron interaction adopts the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) of Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE).43 For the Janus Al2XYZ multilayers, van der Waals dispersion corrections were taken into account using the DFT-D3 approach proposed by Grimme.43 In order to reduce the interaction between layers, the Janus Al2XYZ monolayers are separated in the periodic direction by a 30 Å vacuum region. The dipole correction is applied for asymmetric structures. The energy cutoff, forces, and energy difference criteria of the plane wave are 500 eV, 0.01 eV Å−1, and 10−6 eV, respectively. To obtain accurate electronic properties, the screened hybrid functional of Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE06) is employed.44 In order to obtain more accurate optical properties of the material, the calculation method of G0W0 + Bethe–Salpeter equation (G0W0 + BSE) is adopted. On the basis of G0W0 calculation,45 the absorption spectrum of Al2XYZ is calculated by solving the Bethe–Salpeter equation (BSE).46 For the calculation of G0W0, the k-point set of 5 × 5 × 1 is adopted and the cutoff energy is 450 eV. The piezoelectric, mobility and elastic properties were calculated in the orthorhombic supercells.
3. Results and discussions
3.1 Geometrical properties and stability
The optimized structures of Al2XYZ (X/Y/Z = S, Se, Te, X ≠ Y ≠ Z) monolayers are shown in Fig. 1. The Al2XYZ structure is obtained by inserting a layer of sulfur group elements based on four atomic layers Al2SSe.47 It can be seen that single-layer Al2XYZ obviously consists of five layers. Here we investigated six possible models of Al2XYZ monolayer: Al2SSeTe, Al2STeSe, Al2SeSTe, Al2SeTeS, Al2TeSSe, and Al2TeSeS (as seen in Fig. S1, ESI†). The optimized lattice parameters, bond lengths and bond angles of all the Janus Al2XYZ structures are summarized in Table 1.

In order to calculate the stability of 2D Janus Al2XYZ monolayers, the cohesive energy (Ecoh) is calculated first, which is obtained from: Ecoh = (2EAl + EX + EY + EZ − Etot)/5(1)where EAl, EX, EY, and EZ are the single atomic energies of the Al, X, Y and Z atoms, respectively, and Etot is the total energy of the Al2XYZ monolayers. The calculated cohesive energies are listed in Table 1. The results show that the cohesive energies of Al2XYZ monolayers are all positive, which indicates that the six structures of Al2XYZ are energetically favorable.
Then we calculated the phonon dispersions of Al2XYZ monolayers, which are shown in Fig. 2. We adopted the 6 × 6 supercell and 1 × 1 k-point mesh of Al2XYZ monolayers to obtain an accurate phonon spectrum. It can be observed that the small virtual frequency at the Γ-point comes from the numerical error, which can be removed through the Acoustic Sum Rule (ASR), and thus can be ignored.48 Every phonon dispersion contains 15 vibrational branches because there are five atoms of Al2XYZ monolayer. From the phonon spectrum, it can clearly be observed that the three acoustic branches of Al2XYZ are located in the low-frequency region, while the optical branches are in the high-frequency region. The phonon modes of the Al2XYZ monolayer at the Γ-point can be decomposed into ΓC3v = 5A1 + 5E, where A1/E as the nondegenerate/doubly degenerate phonon modes at the Γ-point represent out-of-plane optical (ZO) modes/a combination of the in-plane transverse (TO) and longitudinal optical (LO) phonon modes.49 Meanwhile, we used ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations to evaluate the thermal stability of Janus Al2XYZ monolayers. As shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†), the well-preserved geometries of the six models of Al2XYZ monolayers at a temperature of 300 K indicate that they have thermal stabilities.

Further, we examined the elastic parameters Cij of Janus Al2XYZ monolayers to explore their mechanical stability. C11 and C12 were calculated from the energy change under uniaxial strains εx and εy along two in-plane directions. C22 and C66 are obtained from the expressions C22 = C11 and C66 = (C11 − C12)/2. The elastic constants Cij of all the Al2XYZ monolayers are presented in Table 2. For hexagonal 2D materials with mechanical stabilities, they must obey Born–Huang's criteria (C11 > |C12| and C11 > 0).50 This implies that the six modes of Al2XYZ monolayers are mechanically stable.

Considering that Young's modulus Y2D(θ) and Poisson's ratio ν(θ) depend strongly on the angle, they can be calculated using the following formulae: (2) (3)where A = sinθ, B = cosθ, and D = (C11C22 − C122)/C66 with θ being the angle of the investigated direction. In Fig. 3, we can see that Young's modulus Y2D(θ) and Poisson's ratio ν(θ) related to the angle are standard circles, which indicates that they are independent of the angle θ, owing to the isotropic atomic structure in the plane of the Al2XYZ monolayer. Therefore, the Janus Al2XYZ monolayers are mechanically isotropic. Al2SSeTe has the highest in-plane stiffness of 88.57 N m−1. The Young's modulus of Al2XYZ monolayers is comparable to that of Al2SSe51 and much lower than those of other 2D materials, such as h-BN (270 N m−1)52 or MoS2 (180 ± 60 N m−1)53 monolayers. The results mean that Al2XYZ monolayers are outstandingly flexible materials which makes them suitable for application in flexible nanodevices.

3.2 Electronic properties
In order to reveal the bonding properties of Al2XYZ monolayers, we calculated the electron local function (ELF)54 and charge density difference (Δρ = ρAl2XYZ − ρAl − ρX − ρY − ρZ).55Fig. 4(a) shows the ELF of the Al2SeTeS monolayer. It can be observed that the red region is mainly distributed in the range of S, Se, and Te atoms and the region near the Al atom is blue. Here the ELF of the Al2SeTeS monolayer indicates that the chemical bonds are entirely ionic bonds. The charge density difference in Fig. 4(b) also demonstrates that the Al2SeTeS monolayer has the characteristics of an ionic crystal, which is consistent with the ELF. Due to the lack of symmetry, an intrinsic built-in electric field along the z-direction appears in Janus Al2XYZ structures.56 This results in two different vacuum energies between the surfaces of the Janus material. Hence, it is necessary to calculate the planar average potential of the Janus structures57 using dipole correction. The planar average potential of Al2SeTeS monolayer is shown in Fig. 4(c). The vacuum level difference ΔΦ between the two sides is 2.60 eV in Al2SeTeS monolayers. For the other Janus structures, their ELF, charge density difference, and plane-averaged electrostatic potential are similar to those of the Al2SeTeS monolayer, as seen in Fig. S3–S5 (ESI†). The work functions Φ can be calculated based on the expression Φ = Evac − EF, where the vacuum level Evac and the Fermi level EF are shown in Fig. 4(c). Table 3 summarizes the work function Φ1/Φ2 on the bottom/top side of six Janus Al2XYZ monolayers. The results indicate that the work functions Φ1 and Φ2 of Al2SeTeS are bigger than in the other five configurations. This implies that it is more difficult for the electron of Al2SeTeS to escape from the surface than for other monolayers.

In order to obtain more accurate electronic properties of Al2XYZ monolayers, the band structures using PBE and the HSE06 functional are shown in Fig. 5. With the PBE functional, we can see that Al2TeSSe is the metal, and the other monolayers are the semiconductors. Moreover, Al2SeSTe, and Al2TeSeS monolayers with VBM and CBM both located at the Γ-point exhibit direct band-gap character. At the HSE06 functional, the band gap of the Al2XYZ monolayers varies from 0.14 to 2.73 eV, as summarized in Table 3. In particular, the Al2TeSSe monolayer has become a semiconductor from a metal (at the PBE level) with a narrow band gap of 0.14 eV. The PBE functional underestimates the energy gap of semiconductors which is consistent with previous reports.58,59

3.3 Photocatalytic water decomposition properties

3.3.1 Band-edge positions and solar-to-hydrogen (STH) efficiencies. 
The photocatalytic decomposition of water is a reliable method of generating hydrogen fuel power. In order to effectively decompose water, the photocatalyst must not only satisfy a band gap of 1.23 eV or more, but also satisfy the requirement that the band-edge position must cross the redox potential of water.60 The redox potential of photocatalytic water splitting depends on the pH value, described by the following formulae: (4) (5)
According to the reaction mechanism of photocatalytic decomposition of water, the 2D Janus structure can separate the electron and hole carriers by tuning the intrinsic dipole. For the 2D Janus structure, the band gap of the photocatalyst is described by Eg + ΔΦ > 1.23 (Eg > 0) due to the vacuum energy difference.61 Thus, it is possible to reduce the band gap of the photocatalyst to the infrared region. For large values ΔΦ (ΔΦ > 1.23 eV), water decomposition of the 2D Janus materials with a narrow band gap can also occur.61 Therefore, 2D Janus materials have been predicted to be promising candidates for photocatalysts. From Table 3, it can be seen that ΔΦ >1.23 (Eg > 0) for the six 2D Janus Al2XYZ monolayers, which indicates that the band gap can be reduced to the infrared region. This is superior to many photocatalytic materials, such as GeP2S6,62 Ge2P4S2 and Ge2As4S2,63 MX2 (M = Ni, Pd or Pt, and X = S, Se or Te),64 and XAs (X = Si, Ge, Sn).65
To assess the photocatalyst redox potential, we calculated the partial charge density (PCD) of the VBM and CBM of Al2XYZ monolayers. As presented in Fig. 4c and Fig. S5 (ESI†), most of the charge densities of VBM are distributed on the top atomic layers (001), while the CBM are all distributed at the bottom layers (00). Therefore, oxidation and reduction take place on different surfaces (top layer and bottom layer). As shown in Fig. 6, for Al2SSeTe, Al2STeSe, Al2SeSTe, and Al2SeTeS monolayers, the CBM is higher than the reduction potential, and the VBM is lower than the oxidation potential under the conditions of pH = 0, pH = 7 or pH = 14, that is, the band-edge positions all cross the redox potential. Therefore, the four monolayers are all excellent photocatalytic candidates materials under the conditions of pH = 0, pH = 7 or pH = 14. Although the CBM is higher than the reduction potential at pH = 0, pH = 7 or pH = 14, the VBM of Al2TeSSe and Al2TeSeS are only lower than the oxidation potential under pH = 7 or pH = 14. So they only meet the conditions for photocatalytic water decomposition at pH = 7 or pH = 14.

The blue, black and red lines represent the redox potential under pH = 0, PH = 7 and pH = 14, respectively. In addition, the dotted line and the solid line represent the redox potential of (001) and (00) surfaces, respectively. 
The solar-to-hydrogen efficiency (ηSTH) is also directly related to photocatalytic efficiency. It is necessary for calculating the ηSTH to obtain the overpotentials χ(H2) and χ(O2) characterizing the redox ability of the carriers. Here, we studied the STH efficiency (ηSTH) of Al2SSeTe, Al2STeSe, Al2SeSTe, and Al2SeTeS monolayers. The calculated χ(H2) and χ(O2) of Al2SSeTe, Al2STeSe, Al2SeSTe, and Al2SeTeS monolayers are listed in Table 4. The χ(H2) and χ(O2) of the four monolayers are all positive values, indicating that the photogenerated carriers can obtain enough energy for the redox reaction.67Table 4 also shows light absorption efficiencies (ηabs), carrier utilization (ηcu), STH (ηSTH), and corrected STH . It is found that the ηabs value exceeds 80% for Al2SSeTe and Al2SeSTe monolayers. Combined with the favorable χ(H2) and χ(O2), the ηcu values for Al2SSeTe, Al2STeSe, Al2SeSTe, and Al2SeTeS monolayers are larger than 40%. High ηabs and ηcu together give rise to the high STH efficiencies of Al2SSeTe (37.31%) and Al2SeSTe (50.16%) monolayers. The STH efficiencies are corrected due to the intrinsic dipoles of Al2SSeTe, Al2STeSe, Al2SeSTe, and Al2SeTeS monolayers, as shown in Table 4. For comparison, the energy conversion efficiencies of Al2X3 (X = S, Se, Te)66 monolayers are also listed. It is found that the corrected STH  of the Al2SeSTe monolayer is 23.81%, larger than those of all the Al2X3 monolayers. In addition, our predicted STH efficiency of Al2SeSTe (23.81%) is comparable to those of its similar structures In2S2Se (24.79%),22 and In2Se3 (26.9%).56

3.3.2 Optical absorption. 
Since the Janus monolayer Al2XYZ is a promising photocatalyst candidate, its optical absorbance α(ω) is calculated by the G0W0-BSE method based on the absorption coefficient formula as follows: (6)where ω, ε1, and ε2 are the frequency of incident light, and the real part and imaginary parts of the dielectric function. From the optical absorption spectra of the Al2XYZ monolayers, as shown in Fig. 7, it can be seen that the absorption coefficient exceeds the order of 105 cm−1 in the visible light region, which is higher than PtSSe,17 C3XN (X = N, P)68 and comparable to MM′XX′ (M, M′ = Ga, In; X, X′ = S, Se, Te),69 GePAs,70 and Al2OS.71 For the Al2SeSTe monolayer, it is up to 2.3 × 105 cm−1 in the x/y-direction. The optical spectra of Al2SSeTe, Al2SeSTe, Al2TeSSe, and Al2TeSeS are activated in the infrared region. The Janus Al2XYZ monolayers strongly absorb light with an absorption intensity of an order of magnitude of 106 cm−1 in the ultraviolet region. Among them, the absorption intensity of the Al2SeSTe monolayer in the x/y-direction reaches 1.2 × 106 cm−1, which is higher than that of its original structure Al2SSe (6 × 105 cm−1).72 Study shows that extensive absorption from near-infrared to ultraviolet and strong absorption intensity improve the utilization of sunlight, enhancing the energy conversion efficiency. This is consistent with the solar-to-hydrogen (STH) efficiency (ηSTH) listed in Table 4. Thus, the Janus Al2XYZ monolayers are very useful in the high-performance photocatalysis field.

3.3.3 Transport properties. 
For photocatalysts, high carrier mobility can improve the separation of photogenerated carriers and obtain excellent catalytic performance. Here, we have calculated the carrier mobility of four Janus semiconductors (Al2SSeTe, Al2STeSe, Al2SeTeS, and Al2TeSeS) by the PBE functional based on deformation potential theory. The carrier mobility of 2D semiconductor materials can be written as: (7)where e, T, kB, ℏ, C2D, Ed, m*, , and μ2D represent the electronic charge, temperature (set to 300 K), Boltzmann constant, Planck constant, elastic modulus, deformation potential constant, effective mass, average effective mass , and carrier mobility, respectively.
The effective masses of holes and electrons of four Janus monolayers are shown in Table 5. It can be seen that the electron carrier mobilities of all four monolayers are much higher than those of holes. The huge difference between electron and hole mobility can effectively enhance the separation of photogenerated carriers, which effectively improves the photocatalytic efficiency. And the carrier mobilities of Al2SSeTe, Al2STeSe, Al2SeTeS, and Al2TeSeS monolayers are different in the x and y directions. As can be seen from Table 5, the deformation potential constants Ed of electrons and holes along two transport directions are anisotropic, which results in high anisotropy of the carrier mobility. The electron mobility of the Al2SeTeS monolayer along the y-direction μy is higher than μx (x-direction), while it is opposite for the rest of the Al2XYZ monolayers. Further, we found that the μx of Al2STeSe exceeds 1 × 104 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is comparable to the high efficiency photocatalyst SiP273 and higher than that of the similar structure In2X2X′ (X and X′ = S, Se, or Te).22 The high carrier mobility causes the carrier to move rapidly and participate in the water decomposition reaction.

3.3.4 Gibbs free energy. 
In order to evaluate the driving force of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) of the photocatalyst, we calculated the Gibbs free energy change (ΔG) of the Al2SeTeS monolayer in the photocatalytic reaction. According to previous research results,74 the only intermediate product of the HER is H*, while the intermediate products of the OER are OH*, O* and OOH*. The potential of photogenerated electrons for the HER (Ue) and the potential of photogenerated holes for the OER (Uh) are defined as:75–77 (8) (9)where , EVBM and ECBM are the hydrogen reduction potential, and the energies of the VBM and CBM, respectively.
As can be seen from Fig. 6, the Ue and Uh of the Al2SeTeS monolayer are 1.77 V and 0.96 V, respectively. Fig. 8 shows the ΔG of the HER and OER of the Al2SeTeS monolayer at different external potentials. The overpotential of the HER in Fig. 8a is about 1.32 V, which is lower than the potential of photogenerated electrons Ue = 1.77 V. This shows that the HER can be driven by photogenerated electrons in the Al2SeTeS monolayer. As can be seen from Fig. 8b, the maximum difference of the overpotential of the OER is 2.60 V. This value exceeds the potential of photogenerated holes Uh = 0.96 V, indicating that the OER cannot be carried out spontaneously. However, the ΔG of the OER decreases at each step when the external potential is 2.61 V. Therefore, the OER can be carried out spontaneously when a large enough potential is applied. These findings indicate that the Al2SeTeS monolayer can provide enough driving force to split water at the external potential.

3.4 Piezoelectric properties
Due to the lack of symmetry and good flexibility of Janus Al2XYZ (X/Y/Z = S, Se, Te, X ≠ Y ≠ Z) monolayers, we use density functional perturbation theory (DFPT) to calculate their piezoelectric coefficients. The piezoelectric constants of the relaxed ionic materials32 were calculated with the formula: eik = dijCjk(10)where eik, Cjk, and dij represent piezoelectric tensors, elastic tensors, and piezoelectric coefficients, respectively. The in-plane e11 and out-of-plane piezoelectric stress coefficients e31 are calculated under the condition that both electron and ion contributions are considered. The in-plane d11 and out-of-plane piezoelectric coefficient d31 can be derived from C11, C12, e11, and e31.78 The piezoelectric parameters of 2D Janus Al2XYZ monolayers are listed in Table S1 (ESI†). As shown in Fig. 9(a), the Al2XYZ monolayer shows high in-plane piezoelectric coefficient (d11: 3.46–41.28 pm V−1), which is higher than those of MSi2PxAsy (M = Mo, W; x + y = 4) (4.53–6.89 pm V−1),79 MoS2 (3.73 pm V−1),80 Janus SnOSe (27.3 pm V−1),30 α-quartz (2.31 pm V−1),81 and 2D Bi2Te2S (34.96 pm V−1).82 From Fig. 9(b), it can be seen that the out-of-plane piezoelectricity of the Al2XYZ monolayer is up to 0.39 pm V−1, comparable to some piezoelectric materials, such as bulk boron nitride (0.33 pm V−1)83 and GaN in the wurtzite phase (0.96 pm V−1).84 The appreciable out-of-plane piezoelectric response of Janus materials can be used in the field of piezoelectric nanogenerators.

It is necessary to consider the effect of strain and number of layers on the piezoelectric properties of 2D Janus materials. Taking the Al2SeTeS monolayer as an example, we have studied the effect of the biaxial strains/uniaxial strains (as seen in Fig. 10, where the minus and positive values represent compressive and tensile strain, respectively) and the number of layers on the piezoelectric properties of the Janus monolayers, respectively. Fig. S6 (ESI†) shows the results of AIMD simulation of the Al2SeTeS monolayer at 2% and −2% (biaxial/uniaxial) strain at 300 K. The well-preserved geometries of the Al2SeTeS monolayer confirm the thermodynamic stability of the Al2SeTeS monolayer under strain engineering. It can clearly be seen from Fig. 10(a) that the change in in-plane piezoelectric coefficient d11 is inversely proportional to the impact of the compressive strain along the x-direction (from 0 to −2%). While d11 is proportional to the tensile strain change from 0% to 1.5% and decreases steeply when the tensile strain exceeds 1.5%. For the strain along the y-direction (from −2% to 2%), the opposite effect on d11 is true (as seen in Fig. 10(b)). It is found that the d11 is highest at 405.63 pm V−1 under a uniaxial strain along the x-direction of 1.5%. It has been increased by about an order of magnitude (from 41.28 pm V−1 to 405.63 pm V−1) and is higher than those of the two-dimensional materials SnSe (about 251 pm V−1),85 SbAs (243 pm V−1),86 or BiInTe3 (362 pm V−1).87Fig. 10(c) shows that the piezoelectric coefficient d11 decreases slightly with compressive strain and increases sharply under tensile strain. Remarkably, the out-of-plane piezoelectricity d31 increases with an increase in the x-direction strain (including compressive and tensile strain) except for tensile strain in the range of 0–0.5% (in Fig. 10(d)). Fig. 10(e) shows that the effect of y-direction strain on d31 is opposite to that of x-direction strain. Compared with the uniaxial strains, the biaxial strain has a negligible effect on d31. Further, d31 goes up to 0.25 pm V−1 from 0.07 pm V−1 under an x-direction uniaxial strain of 2%. All data are listed in Tables S2–S4 (ESI†).

Next, we studied the piezoelectric properties of multilayer Al2SeTeS. Fig. S7 (ESI†) shows the AA and AB stacking modes of multilayer Al2SeTeS. We evaluated the stability of multilayer stacks of Al2SeTeS. The formation energies of multilayer stacks of Al2SeTeS have been calculated using the expression from ref. 19. The results in Table S5 (ESI†) show formation energies of 350–740 meV, indicating that all multilayer structures are stable with vdW integration between the monolayers. Fig. S8 (ESI†) shows the results of AIMD simulations of multilayer structures at 300 K. No broken bond is observed in the multilayer structures, which confirms the thermodynamic stability of the multilayer stacks of Al2SeTeS. Here, we show the band structures of multilayer Al2SeTeS structures under different stacking modes in Fig. S9 (ESI†). The results show that the multilayer structures are still semiconductors with reduced band gaps compared with the Al2SeTeS monolayer. Based on this, we have calculated the piezoelectric coefficient, as shown in Fig. 11. The results show that the in-plane piezoelectric coefficients d11 of multilayer Al2SeTeS are all lower than that of the monolayer type. It is worth noting that the d31 values of the multilayer Al2SeTeS are all higher than that of the monolayer type except the two-layer Al2SeTeS with AA, which goes up to 0.44 pm V−1 for the two-layer structure with AB stacking mode. Based on the calculation results, we believe that the piezoelectric properties of Al2XYZ monolayers can be highly adjusted by small strain and multilayer stacking.

4. Conclusion
In this work, the electronic, photocatalytic, mechanical, and piezoelectric features of Al2XYZ (X/Y/Z = S, Se, Te, X ≠ Y ≠ Z) have been systematically studied. The calculation results show that all six Al2XYZ structures are stable, and are direct or indirect semiconductors with band gaps ranging from 0.14 to 2.74 eV under the HSE06 level. The Young's modulus and Poisson ratio suggest that Al2XYZ monolayers can be used in flexible electronic devices. Moreover, all monolayers have suitable band-edge positions, efficient utilization of sunlight (up to 80%), high hydrogen production efficiency (up to 23.81%), and high carrier mobility (104 cm2 V−1 s−1), which provide another candidate material for the photocatalytic decomposition of water to hydrogen production. Moreover, the Al2SeTeS monolayer can provide enough driving force to split water at the external potential. In addition, the in- and out-of-plane piezoelectric response are superior for all Al2XYZ monolayers. Then the in-plane d11 and out-of-plane piezoelectric coefficient d31 reach 405.63 pm V−1 and 0.25 pm V−1 under strain, respectively. For a two-layer 2D Al2SeTeS structure under AB stacking mode, d31 increases from 0.07 pm V−1 to 0.44 pm V−1. This study will enrich the candidates of 2D photocatalysis and piezoelectric materials and promote the development of high-performance electronic devices.
