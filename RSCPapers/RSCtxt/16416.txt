    , Accepted 6th January 2020First published on 6th January 2020AbstractThe crystals of pure [(CH3)3NH]2[KFe(CN)6] (TrMAFe) and [(CH3)3NH]2[KCo(CN)6] (TrMACo) as well as their mixed crystals (TrMAFexCo1−x), with different ratios of x = 0, 0.12, 0.18, 0.49, 0.56, 0.73, 0.81, 1.0, have been grown from aqueous solutions. The structure of TrMACo has been determined at 360 K to be cubic (Fmm). In phase II (100 K), the TrMACo crystal is monoclinic (C2/c). The thermal stability of the pure and mixed crystals has been determined by using both DTA and TGA. Based on the DSC results, we have found a single phase transition (PT) for both pure and mixed crystals. The Fe(III) concentration was estimated by using the SEM technique. We have found a linear relationship between the PT temperature (Tc) and the molar concentration of Fe(III). Based on the obtained results, a phase diagram has been constructed. The mechanism of the structural PT has been discussed based on the results of dielectric relaxation and 1H NMR and X-ray spectroscopy measurements. The results confirmed that the PT mechanism of both pure and mixed crystals is related to the change in the dynamic state of the TrMA+ cations. The dielectric activation energy changes linearly with the mole fraction ranking from 35 to 38 kJ mol−1, for the mixed crystals.
1. Introduction
To improve efficiency and/or reduce synthesis costs, the most convenient method is the doping of one or two components into existing solid-state systems. Usually selected dopants have similar properties; they can be either ions or whole molecules. In this way, the systems can be fine-tuned to obtain specific parameters, like shifting the ferroelectric phases to a different temperature range, generating ferromagnetic properties, and improving the performance or crystal stability. The following are selected examples from an extensive database of the literature on mixed crystals.
Recently, a multiaxial ferroelectric crystal was synthesized by the combination of two types of easily disordered cations (dimethylammonium and benzylammonium cations), which differ in their structure or aromaticity: [(CH3)2NH2][C6H5CH2NH3]2BiBr6.1 The introduction of the CH3NH3+ cation to the formate perovskite, [NH2NH3][Mn(HCOO)3], decreases the ferroelectric transition temperature.2 In the doped system, the polarization value of the polar phase also decreases, but the system gains a new parameter, called weak ferromagnetism; therefore, this may also be included in the group of multiferroics.
The emergence of organic–inorganic hybrids CH3NH3PbI3 as solid-state Dye-Sensitized Solar Cells (DSSCs) in 2012 triggered an explosion of interest in lead-halide perovskites to be used in the manufacture of solar absorbers.3 Thanks to the development of perovskite sensitizers, a remarkable increase in power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) from 4% to 22% was achieved in just 6 years.4 It was proved that the excellent light-harvesting characteristics of the perovskite sensitizer arose from the purely two-dimensional (2D) layered structures. Despite such great interest in perovskites used in solar cells, some difficulties in their use are still encountered. These difficulties are mainly related to cell stability, toxicity to the environment (lead), and the relatively high price of substrates (complex organic compounds). Therefore, alternative solutions have been proposed, e.g. designing new perovskites, in which halide ions are substituted by pseudo halide anions (CH3NH3Pb(SCN)2I).5 In this way, the obtained crystals degrade much more slowly than CH3NH3PbI3 upon exposure to air with a relative humidity of 95%. According to theoretical calculations, the 2D layered structure is predicted to be stable for over 17 new analogue compounds with the general formula (CH3NH3)2MY2X2 (where M: Sn, Pb, Y: OCN, SCN, and SeCN, and X: Cl, Br, and I), thereby providing the opportunity to experimentally verify the results obtained.6
The other examples may be crystals that were doped with halide ligands. Wojtaś et al. demonstrated that even a small amount of doping of halogen Br atoms to the ferroelectric crystal [4-NH2PyH][SbCl4] significantly affects the desired properties.7 A decrease in the transition temperature from the polar to the non-polar phase was observed, thereby causing an increase in the range of temperature within which the ferroelectric phase was stable. However, upon studying the other crystal, [(CH3)3NH]3[Sb2Cl9], the same authors proved that the substitution of the Sb(III) atom by the Bi(III) atom similarly affects the properties of the polar organic–inorganic hybrids, such as the replacement of the halogen atoms (Cl/Br) in the anionic units.8 Nevertheless, the metal substitution effect is stronger.9
It is worth mentioning that the desired parameters of the other mixed crystals are strengthened with an admixture of one of the components. A good example is the A2B2(SO4)2X4 (A: Rb and Cs; B: Bi(III) and Sb(III); and X: F, Cl, Br, and I) system in which the halide atoms are substituted with the SO42− groups. In this way, a family of crystals with highly promising nonlinear optical (NLO) properties was obtained. These compounds exhibit a strong second harmonic generation (SHG) response that is about three and sometimes even five times larger than that observed for KDP.10,11
We herein report the result obtained for the solid solution series, where Co(III) in the B′′-site is doped with the Fe(III) atom in the structure of the double-perovskites with the general formula: [(CH3)3NH]2[KFexCo1−x(CN)6] x = 0, 0.12, 0.18, 0.49, 0.56, 0.73, 0.81, and 1.0. In this way, we can obtain crystals belonging to the organic–inorganic hybrids (HOIPs) that exhibit dynamic changes, above all in the organic polar guests trapped in the anionic inorganic cages. It has been found that, to date, the cyano-bridged HOIPs possess the double perovskite-type structure, A2B′B′′(CN)6, wherein in the A site small organic molecules with a spherical shape such as methyl-ammonium,12–18 aromatic imidazolium,19,20 planar-shaped guanidium,21 formamidinium22 or acetamidinium21,23 cations reside in the inorganic framework formed by B′-NC-B′′ units. The cyano groups link two kinds of metal cations, the monovalent alkali (Na+, K+, Rb+, and Cs+) with a trivalent 3d transition one (Cr(III), Fe(III), and Co(III)). A characteristic feature of these HOIPs is the presence of a high-symmetrical prototype phase (cubic, Fmm), and the movements of the guest molecule induce structural transitions to ferroelastic phases. Depending on the polarity of the organic cation, we can observe a dielectrically active switching between two states: low dielectric state (LDS) and high dielectric state (HDS).
Our primary goal in this work is to investigate the impact of doping on the guest molecule mobility and the fine-controlling of the PT temperature by the trivalent metal in the B′′-site. The trimethylammonium cation (TrMA+) was chosen as a guest molecule and the inorganic cage was constructed with the K–NC–Co units. This system was doped with the Fe(III) cation in the range of mole fraction of 0.2 < x < 1. For a full characterisation of the pure [(CH3)3NH]2[KFe(CN)6] (TrMAFe) and [(CH3)3NH]2[KCo(CN)6] (TrMACo) as well as their mixed crystals (TrMAFexCo1−x), methods like scanning electron microscopy (SEM), coupled with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), were used, and structural and thermal analyses were combined with dielectric and 1H NMR spectroscopy.
2. Experimental
2.1. Preparation
The single-crystals of the pure compounds were prepared by a reaction of trimethylammonium hydrochloride ((CH)3NH·Cl, Sigma, ≥98%, abbr. TrMA) with K3Fe(CN)6 or K3Co(CN)6 (Sigma-Aldrich, ACS reagent, ≥95.0%) in a molar ratio of 3:1 in order to obtain [(CH)3NH]2[KCo(CN)6] (TrMACo), [(CH)3NH]2[KFe(CN)6] (TrMAFe) and the mixed-crystals of [(CH)3NH]2[KFexCo1−x(CN)6] TrMAFexCo1−x (Fig. 1). The mixed-crystals, TrMAFexCo1−x, were prepared by dissolving the compounds in deionised water in a proper ratio according to Table S1 (ESI†). After one week, the crystals were brought out from the solution, and their real stoichiometry was checked by SEM–EDS. Since further measurements were planned for polycrystalline samples, the homogeneity of the samples was characterised by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) using a D8 ADVANCE powder X-ray diffractometer with Cu radiation and a Vantec detector (Fig. S1, ESI†). The XRD result shows that the samples of TrMAFexCo1−x with x = 0.00, 0.12, 0.18, 049, 0.56, 0.73, 0.82, and 1.00 contain only the expected phase without any parasites. PXRD for the crystal without the Fe(III) dopant was calculated based on the single-crystal structure of TrMACo.

2.2. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
The SEM measurements were carried out using a Hitachi S-3400N scanning electron microscope equipped with a tungsten cathode. The images were recorded using backscattered electrons. The EDS measurements were made with a Noran System7 analyzer with the Thermo Scientific Ultra Dry detector at 129 eV resolution. Due to the non-sputtering of gold into the samples, the measurements were carried out in a low vacuum at a pressure of 30 Pa in the measuring chamber. All analyses were carried out with a 30 kV accelerating voltage.
2.3. Thermal analysis
Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements were carried out using a Netzsch DSC 404 F1 Pegasus calorimeter with a scanning rate of 10 K min−1 on cooling/heating in the temperature range of 300–360 K. The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed using a Netzsch TG 209 F1 Libra instrument in the temperature range of 295–500 K with a ramp rate of 5 K min−1. The scans were performed in flowing nitrogen (flow rate: 1 dm3 h−1).
2.4. Crystal structure determination
The single crystal of TrMACo was mounted on a CCD Xcalibur diffractometer (graphite monochromatic, MoKα radiation, λ = 0.71073 Å). The measurements were done at 100.0(1) and 360.0(1) K. The corrections to the Lorentz and polarization factors were applied to the reflection intensities.24 The structures were solved by direct methods by applying the SHELX program package.25 The hydrogen atoms were determined from the geometric concepts and refined in a riding model with isotropic temperature factors 1.2 and 1.5 times the Ueq value of the parent atom (N and C, respectively). All non-hydrogen atoms were located by difference Fourier synthesis and refined by the least-squares method in the full-matrix anisotropic approximation. The collected crystallographic data for the compounds and details of the X-ray experiment are given in Table S2 (ESI†). The crystallographic data have been deposited with the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre no. 1965548 and 1965549 for the structure at 100 and 360 K, respectively.†
2.5. Dielectric measurement
The complex dielectric permittivity, ε* = ε′ − iε′′, was measured between 150 and 370 K by using an Agilent E4980A Precision LCR Meter in the frequency range of 135 Hz–2 MHz and by means of a HP 4191A impedance analyzer in the frequency range of 10 to 1000 MHz. The overall errors for the real and imaginary parts of the complex dielectric permittivity were less than 5% and 10%, respectively. The dielectric response was measured using the sample as pellets with S = 20 mm2 and d = 0.74 ÷ 1.3 mm. The powder was milled for 1 min in an agate mortar, then uniaxially pressed in a cylindrical die with 5 mm under a 500 MPa compressing stress for 5 min. The surfaces of the pellet were coated with silver conductive paint (Electron Microscopy Sciences, 503). The dielectric measurements were carried out under a controlled atmosphere (N2).
2.6. 
          1H NMR measurements

T
1 relaxation times (1H NMR) derived from one-exponential signal recovery were measured with an ELLAB TEL-Atomic PS 15 spectrometer working at the Larmor frequency of 25 MHz in temperatures ranging from 80 K to 380 K. The second moment of the 1H NMR line was measured by using a continuous wave spectrometer ELLAB TEL-Atomic CWS 12–50 working on protons at the frequency of 28.2 MHz in temperatures ranging from 111 K to 380 K. The second moment values were determined by a numerical integration of the absorption curve derivatives. The sample was degassed at room temperature and sealed under vacuum in glass.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Stoichiometry analysis
After one week the portion of the crystals was brought out from the solution, and their real crystal stoichiometries were checked by scrutinizing the SEM measurements. For this purpose, eight mixed-crystals were chosen, representing the x = 0.12, 0.28, 0.49, 0.56, 0.73, 0.81 of the Fe(III) molar fractions in the formula TrMAFexCo1−x. For chemical characterisation, EDS was applied. Fig. 2a presents the EDS spectra obtained for each crystal, and these spectra were recorded in four places of the crystal surface, whereas Fig. 2b shows the exemplary SEM photographs of the TrMAFe0.81Co0.19 crystal. The atomic concentration of the mixed-crystals obtained from the EDS analysis and the photographs of the other crystals are presented in Table S3 (ESI†). After EDS measurement, the crystals were analysed by the DSC technique.

3.2. Thermal properties
A pure crystal of TrMACo undergoes a structural phase transition (PT) similar to its analogues with Fe(III) (TrMAFe).15,26 However, in this case, the temperature of the transition is shifted by 30 degrees towards a high temperature (349 K in the heating cycle). Such a significant difference in the PT temperatures encouraged us to obtain mixed crystals, in which the transition temperature is modulated with the Fe(III) dopant. Fig. 3a presents the DSC curves obtained upon the heating and cooling scans of two pure (TrMACo and TrMAFe) and mixed crystals (TrMAFexCo1−x) in the molar fraction x ranging from 0.1 to 0.8. As we can see in Fig. 1, while the pure TrMACo crystals are very pale yellow, a small addition of Fe(III) changes the colour from light yellow through orange to brown for the fractions of 0.8 or 1.0. The addition of Fe(III) not only changes the colours of the crystals but above all it also changes the solid-to-solid PT temperature and the thermal stability.

Fig. 3b shows the phase diagram constructed based on the DSC and TGA results (Fig S2 in the ESI† presents the TGA curves). As shown in the figure, the dependence of the PT temperature of the compound varies linearly upon the addition of Fe(III) to the sample. The thermal stability of the crystals also changes linearly, with the admixture of Fe(III) in the B′ site, decreasing the temperature of the solid-to-decomposition transition from 545 to 466 K. However, it should be noted that the obtained crystals are stable when exposed to air.
Based on Boltzmann equation (ΔS = Rln(N2/N1)2), the ratio of the respective numbers of microstates N2/N1 in the high temperature (HT) and low temperature (LT) phases can be roughly estimated, where ΔS is the entropy difference during the PT, R is the gas constant, and the coefficient, 2, pertains to the two organic molecules in one mole of the compound. According to the X-ray data, the TrMA+ cation is disordered over sites two and four in the LT and HT phase, respectively. It means that N2 should be approximately 4 and based on the thermodynamic parameters included in Table S4 (ESI†), the N2 changes linearly from 5.0 (TrMACo, x = 0) to 6.6 calculated for TrMAFe (x = 1). The values of N2 that are higher than 4 indicate that a change not only in the cationic dynamics but also in anionic dynamics should be taken into account, although the anionic contribution in the PT mechanism is more significant for the crystals with Fe(III) admixtures.
3.3. Crystal structure determination
The asymmetric part of the structure TrMACo in the LT and HT phases with the atom-numbering scheme is presented in Fig. 4a. Geometrical parameters are summarised in Tables S5 and S6 (ESI†). In both compounds, the Co3+ and K+ ions are octahedrally coordinated by the –CN– cyano ligands that bridge the neighbouring coordinating spheres forming the double perovskite structure, where the cubic 3-D infinitive cages hold cationic TrMA guests.
 Fig. 4  (a) Unrelated part of the unit cells with the atom-numbering scheme in a single-cage of TrMACo in the LT (100 K) and HT (360 K) phases. The asymmetric part is drawn as displacement ellipsoids with 50 and 20% probability for the LT and HT phases, respectively. (b) Packing diagram of the LT and HT phases. 
The structural difference between the phases is mainly attributed to the dynamics of the organic cation. In the LT phase, the guest molecule motions are frozen while in HT, the molecules are disordered. The structure of TrMACo at 360 K is cubic (Fmm). Due to the high symmetry, the octahedral geometry is ideal with the same values of bond lengths and the trans and cis valence angles are 180° and 90°, respectively. The central N10 atom of an organic cation lies at the (0.5, 0.75, 0.75) special position with the occupation factor of 1/24. The cation is disordered over four sites as required by the cubic symmetry. The hydrogen bonds between the main framework and TrMA+ cation are rather loose with the donor–acceptor distances of 3.631(8) Å. In the LT phase (100 K), the crystal is monoclinic (C2/c). The anionic cages are formed by the Co–CN–K bridges and are slightly deformed. Deformation is observed for the cis angles, where the largest deviation amounts to 2.32(6)°/13.14(5)° for Co[CN]6/K[NC]6, respectively. The trans angles of the Co[CN]6 moiety amount to 180.0(7)°. However, the K[NC]6 coordination is strongly distorted as the trans angles range between 166.47(4)° and 167.47(5)°, and the K–N bond distances differ by 0.395(1) Å. The relevant Co–C distances differ by 0.012(1) Å only. The guest TrMA+ molecule is disordered over two sites with the nitrogen N10 atom's occupancy factor of 0.5. The cation interacts with the main framework via both C–H⋯N and N–H⋯N hydrogen bonds (Table S6†). Each –CH3 group of the cationic guest donates one or two hydrogen atoms, respectively, to the N atom of –CN– bridge forming a complex hydrogen-bonding pattern within the cage. Nevertheless, the bonds are rather weak as the distances between the donor and acceptor for all bonds are larger than 3.1 Å.
The structural differences between the LT and HT phases lie in the cell volume, –CN– bridge structure, N–K bond lengths and, as pointed above, in the motional modes of the organic guest molecule. The cell volume at 100 K is smaller by 65.4(2) Å3 as compared to that of the HT phase. This difference is essentially attributed to the changes in the [KCo(CN)6] framework structure (see Fig. 4b). At LT, the K[NC]6 moiety is the main one, the structure of which differs from that at HT. The K1–N1 and K1–N2 are shortened by 0.163(1) Å and 0.130(1) Å, while K1–N3 is elongated by 0.232(1) Å.
Moreover, the N–K–N valence angles are reduced down to 166.47(4)° and 78.53(5)° for the trans and cis angles, respectively. However, the most significant contribution to the structural difference consists of the changes in the thermal motions of the organic cation. At 360 K the cation is disordered over four sites and interacts with the main framework via only weak C–H⋯N hydrogen bonds. The motions at decreased temperatures are partially frozen, and the cation in the LT phase is disordered only over two sites. Here it interacts with the framework via both the C–H⋯N and N–H⋯N contacts. The PT at 349 K causes a reduction in the hydrogen bond number. However, the strength of the bonds increases as the donor–acceptor distances are notably reduced. The analysis of the contact surface upon the TrMA+ cation removal shows an increase in the volume of the main framework cages with temperature. The surface volume for TrMACo increases by 12.2% of the unit cell volume (from 27.4% up to 39.6%).
3.4. Dielectric properties
The temperature dependence of a real and imaginary part of the electric permittivity for the pure TrMACo measured for the polycrystalline pellet is presented in Fig. 5. In the graph, the observed anomaly on the real part, ε′, run, i.e. a slight step-wise change (Δε ∼ 2), is related to the structural PT from the LT to HT phase. Besides, for temperatures below 300 K, the relaxation process appeared in the measuring range of frequency.
 Fig. 5  Temperature-dependent electric permittivity for the pure TrMACo, the real ε′ (a) and imaginary part ε′′ (b) measured upon the heating run. (c) Normalized dielectric response for pure TrMAFe (x = 1), TrMACo (x = 0) and mixed-crystals TrMAFexCo1−x. 
This kind of dielectric response was previously observed for the crystal with x = 1, TrMAFe, as well.15 For the range of frequency between 500 Hz and 2 M Hz, the dielectric relaxation was observed exclusively for the LT phase (Fig. 5a and b). However, the exceptionally high permittivity values at 2 MHz in the HT phase suggest that the cationic movement is much faster and should affect the frequency dependence of ε′ above 2 MHz. In the vicinity of the PT, changes in the permittivity value are associated with the switching between two states, the “frozen” (LT) and highly disordered (HT) being almost in a melt-like state, whereby the transition is dielectrically active. Based on the phase diagram, we can conclude that the PT temperature changes linearly with increasing dopant Fe(III) mole fraction, which reflects the dielectric response in the vicinity of the transition. Fig. 5c presents the normalized ε′(ε′/ε′max) vs. temperature for 2 MHz. The admixture of Fe(III) decreases the point of the ε′ jumps in PT towards low temperatures. This result confirms that the switching between LDS and HDS can be readily fine-tuned by the addition of a trivalent cation into the inorganic framework.

Fig. 6a and b illustrate the dielectric relaxation process and the frequency dependence of ε′ and ε′′ at various temperatures. In the temperature range between 180 and 250 K, the dielectric dispersion and absorption are significant. In the LT phase, the maxima of the absorption increases slightly in value and moves towards high frequencies with temperature. At 250 K, the relaxation process was observed in the microwave region, as was observed for TrMAFe15 previously. As shown in Fig. 6c, the dielectric relaxation at 200 K extends to the next region of the frequency (GHz region). Then the observed process disappears just before PT at 319 K. As mentioned earlier, the real part of permittivity at 2 MHz is relatively high and the appearance of a fragment of the relaxation process above the PT temperature suggests a cationic motion similar to that observed in the plastic crystals, where overall molecular tumbling occurs in a cubic phase and is too fast to measure it in the radio and microwave frequency region. From the experimental data, in the whole analysed temperature range, the four-parameter Cole–Cole27 function was adjusted: (1)

The solid line represents the fit to the Cole–Cole equation (eqn (1)). (c) The temperature and frequency dependence of ε′′ measured for TrMAFe in two ranges of frequency either up to 1 MHz or to 1 GHz. 
where ε0 and ε∞ are the low and high frequency limits, ω is the angular frequency, τ is the macroscopic relaxation time, and α represents the relaxation time distribution parameter.
The result of the fitting, the macroscopic relaxation times, τ = 1/(2πf), is presented in Fig. 7a and the same operation was carried out for TrMAFe and for the mixed TrMAFexCo1−x crystals. It should be noted that τ (in the log scale) vs. 1/T obeys the Arrhenius type of relationship, which indicates the thermally activated reorientations. The estimated activation energies vary from 34.7 to 38.1 kJ mol−1 for TrMAFe and TrMACo, respectively.
 Fig. 7  (a) The temperature dependence of the macroscopic dielectric relaxation time for the pure TrMAFe (red points) and TrMACo (blue points) crystals. Models 1 (green points) and 2 (grey points) present results obtained from fitting to the 1H NMR data. (b) The temperature dependence of the activation energy vs. the molar ratio of Fe(III). 

Fig. 7b illustrates the dependence of the activation energy on the mole fraction, x, of the Fe(III) dopant. The addition of Fe(III) reduces the height of the activation barrier in a linear way. Differences in activity energies can be related to the size of the inorganic cage in the LT phase. In the case of TrMAFe, the size of the single-cage calculated based on the crystal structure was found to be 468.65 Å3, while for the crystals with Co(III) the volume decreases to 466.04 Å3. In conclusion, the gap created by the inorganic framework is smaller in the TrMACo crystal than in TrMAFe. In the cage of the TrMACo crystal, the guest molecule (TrMA+) exhibits less freedom of rotation compared to that in TrMAFe.

          1H NMR

Fig. 8 shows the temperature dependence of the proton spin–lattice relaxation time (T1), and the second moment (M2) for the temperature range between 80 and 380 K obtained for TrMACo. The scheme presented in Fig. 8a shows two models taken into account in the fitting procedure. In the first attempt (model 1), the reorientations of each methyl groups in TrMA cation around their C3 axes (along with C–N bonds) have been assumed. In the other attempt (model 2), the reorientation of the cation as a whole around its C′3 axis (along with N–H bond) has been additionally used.

The diagram shows two minima of T1, the first deeper one at 165 K (T1 = 17 ms) and the other shallower one at 220 K (T1 = 32 ms) (Fig. 8b). In the vicinity of PT (349 K), the relaxation time elongates rapidly and the discontinuous jump from 0.62 up to 3.65 s is observed, indicating the first order PT. This observation, related to the presence of PT, is consistent with the DSC results. The T1 data obtained for TrMACo were analysed quantitatively using the model developed by Idziak et al.,28 which has been already applied for relaxing the trimethylammonium cations. In the theoretical approach, two possible motional modes for the trimethylammonium cation have been considered.
Thus the relaxation time determined using the dipolar interactions between the trimethylammonium protons can be expressed by the following equation: (2)where: τc2−1 = τc−1 + τc1−1(3)and (4)
Here, τc and τc1 correspond to the correlation times of a methyl group rotation and TrMA+ cation rotation (model 2), respectively. The effective H–H radius in the methyl group (1.79 Å) defines r, while R is the distance between the methyl groups (∼3.04 Å) and γ is the gyromagnetic ratio. The f(τ) part describes the spectral density of the correlation function taken from the BPP theory.29 The relaxation time of these two motions obeys the Arrhenius law τc = τc0exp(Ea/RT), where Ea is the activation energy for the assumed type of motion. The theoretical solid line was drawn assuming the reorientation of the three CH3 groups with Ea = 13.9 kJ mol−1 (0.14 eV) and τc0 = 1.3 × 10−13 s as well as for the C3 reorientation of the whole [(CH3)3NH]+ cation around the N–H molecular axis with Ea1 = 21.4 kJ mol−1 (0.22 eV) and τc01 = 1.4 × 10−13 s. It should be noted that the molecular dynamical parameters for both presented motional modes in the trimethylammonium cations are comparable. It may mean that the trimethylammonium cation in the cages of the crystal lattice performs quite free reorientations. The obtained activation energies and correlation times are comparable to those observed in the other compounds with trimethylammonium cation.28,30–34Fig. 8b shows the 1H NMR relaxation time vs. 1000/T, in which the solid line corresponds to the model determined based on the Arrhenius relationships for the models 1 and 2. The difference in the estimated relaxation times from the two models is visible. Now it is evident that the dielectric spectroscopy monitors the cationic movement differently than that revealed by 1H NMR. Since the dielectrically active motion is associated with the dipole moment changes, the additional molecular motion in the LT phase, which is accompanied by a dipole moment change, should be taken into consideration. Based on the X-ray data, we can postulate that the twofold reorientation, an angle of about 180 around the C2 axis called π-flips (Fig. 8a), may contribute to the dielectric response.
In the vicinity of 137 K, a small discontinuity on the temperature dependence of T1 is observed. Unfortunately, the observed anomaly in the NMR measurement was not registered by any other research methods used by us. However, it should be noted that in the NMR experiment the sample was cooled to 80 K and then the signal was recorded in the heating cycle. In turn, the thermal and dielectric measurements were carried out in the temperature range from 100 up to 370 K and it was possible that the sample had not cooled down sufficiently and the potential transition was not been reached due to significant temperature hysteresis for PT. For measurement data in the temperature range from 100 to 143 K, the activation energy of the methyl group rotation was estimated based on the BPP theory.29 The small magnitude of the observed changes in T1 suggests rather the further ordering of the cations, which may be postulated based on a quite small activation energy value equal to 8.4 kJ mol−1 (0.086 eV). This small value of activation energy is typical of the C3 jumps of methyl groups.35,36 If we consider the methyl group reorientations in this temperature interval in real terms, they cannot contribute to the dielectric response since any dielectric moment change does not accompany such a motion.
The onset of a plateau observed at the lowest temperatures may reflect the domination of the relaxation path via the quadrupolar nuclei, (mainly 59Co).23,37–41 In turn, above the PT, the activation energy estimated from the T1vs. 1/T slope is equal to 17.6 kJ mol−1 that indicates a slight decrease of Ea value in comparison with that found at low temperatures. This fact is consistent with the crystal modification (or crystal structure change) in the first-order PT.

Fig. 8c presents the temperature dependencies of the second moment, M2, of the 1H NMR (in the G2 units). Based on the crystallographic data (the C–H length equal to 1.09 Å, and N–H – 1.03 Å) for the rigid state of the trimethylammonium cation, the M2 value achieves (solid lines in Fig. 8c) 25.9 G2 (100 K) and 26.1 G2 (RT). The highest value of M2 achieved in the NMR experiment equals ca. 22 G2 (100 K), which means that the full rigid state has not been reached. Two theoretical models were used in the fitting procedure for the temperature dependence of the second moment of TrMACo and TrMAFe. The results of the adjustments are shown in Fig. 8 as the solid red and blue lines. The first model (red) has been calculated from the geometry of the rigid trimethylammonium cation, assuming only one reduction of M2. In the next fitting (blue), the approach from the T1 analysis was adopted. The fitting with two reduction of M2 appears to be better. Since the dynamic parameters of both possible motional modes are comparable, the two processes causing a narrowing of the second moment overlap significantly and the separation of both motional modes contributing to such a temperature dependence of the second moment cannot be carried out precisely. In the case of TrMAFe data, also presented in Fig. 8c, the decrease of the M2 value begins at 76 K, at 20 degrees lower than that for the Co(III) analogue. This effect is associated with the greater rotational freedom for the TrMA+ cation in TrMAFe than that in TrMACo, which was also postulated from the results of the thermal and dielectric response measurements.
4. Conclusion
The crystals of pure [(CH3)3NH]2[KFe(CN)6] (TrMAFe) and [(CH3)3NH]2[KCo(CN)6] (TrMACo) as well as their mixed crystals (TrMAFexCo1−x), with different Fe/Co ratios, i.e. x = 0, 0.12, 0.18, 0.49, 0.56, 0.73, 0.8, 1.0, have been grown and the crystal structure at two temperatures (360 and 100 K) has been determined for TrMACo. The structure of TrMACo in the HT phase at 360 K is cubic (Fmm). The TrMA+ cation is disordered over four sites. The anionic cages are formed by Co–CN–K bridges and become slightly distorted in the LT phase. In phase II (100 K), the crystal is monoclinic (space group C2/c). It is reasonable to assume that, in general, the structure for the mixed crystals is analogical. We have shown that it is possible to control the PT temperature by the replacement of Co(III) with Fe(III) in the mixed TrMAFexCo1−x crystals. We observed the linear relationship of Tc for PT versus molar concentration of Fe(III). The Fe(III) concentration was estimated using the SEM technique and the temperature of the PT was measured using the DSC method. We have found two phases for all crystals studied, both pure and mixed ones—i.e. exclusively one PT, in the temperature interval analysed, is present. Based on these data, the phase diagram has been constructed (see Fig. 3b). The pure and mixed TrMAFexCo1−x crystals are stable to at least 460 K. The dielectric switching has been observed for all analysed mixed TrMAFexCo1−x crystals. Moreover, in the temperature range between 180 and 250 K, the clear dielectric dispersion and absorption are observed. Interestingly, the activation energy changes linearly with the molar concentration of Fe(III), from 35 to 38 kJ mol−1, for the mixed crystals. The dielectric response and 1H NMR results confirmed that the PT mechanism of both pure and mixed crystals is related to the change in the dynamic state of the TrMA+ cations. From the NMR results, it was concluded that in the motional model for the TrMA+ cation the reorientations of each methyl group and the reorientation of the cation as a whole should be taken into account. The model has been applied quantitatively for the fitting procedure to the temperature dependencies of the spin–lattice relaxation times, T1, for TrMACo and the second moment, M2, and for TrMACo and TrMAFe.
