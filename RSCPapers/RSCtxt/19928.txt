    , Accepted 9th May 2022First published on 10th May 2022AbstractConverting CO2 into valuable solar fuels through photocatalysis has been considered a green and sustainable technology that is promising for alleviating global warming and providing energy in an environmentally friendly manner. However, traditional photocatalysts generally suffer from low surface-reactive reaction sites, inefficient light harvesting and rapid recombination of electron–hole pairs. Lead halide perovskite materials have been considered ideal semiconductor photocatalysts for photocatalytic CO2 reduction due to their tunable band gaps, strong light absorption, and low cost. Herein, a series of L2Csn−1PbnX3n+1 (L = ba, ha, oa; X = Cl, Br, I; n = 1, 2) 2D layered perovskites were synthesized by a facile solvothermal method. The effects of alkyl amine chain length, halogen atoms and inorganic layer number on their properties were studied. More importantly, these 2D materials were used as photocatalysts for CO2 reduction without any sacrificial agents. These 2D perovskites exhibited markedly increased performance in comparison with 3D bulk materials, benefitting from the larger surface-area-to-volume ratio and faster and more efficient exciton dissociation, which achieved the highest CO yield of 158.69 μmol g−1 h−1 and CH4 yield of 6.9 μmol g−1 h−1 through the design of the photocatalytic system. In addition, the influence of light source conditions on photocatalysis was studied systematically, including light source intensity and wavelength. The experimental results indicated that an appropriate solvent, high light intensity and monochromatic light source matching the wavelength of exciton absorption can effectively improve the photocatalytic efficiency.
1. Introduction
In the 21st century, the two most serious problems facing mankind are the energy crisis and environmental pollution.1 Energy production is predominantly dependent on fossil fuels, such as coal, oil or natural gas, which are inextricably linked to large CO2 emissions and cause many environmental problems. In this case, it is necessary to find a way of reducing atmospheric CO2 and producing energy at the same time.2 Solar energy is the most attractive alternative energy source because the sun provides free, renewable, abundant and sustainable energy.1,3 Therefore, tremendous attention has been given to the effective utilization of solar energy.1,4 One feasible way to utilize solar energy is to convert it into chemical energy by photocatalysis, where light is used to stimulate chemical reactions, and CO2 can be reduced to generate chemical fuel.3–8 The conversion of CO2 into valuable solar fuels by photocatalysts simultaneously mitigates global warming and provides an energy source in an environmentally friendly manner.2 In recent years, many photocatalysts have been reported for solar-driven photocatalytic CO2 reduction, such as metal oxides,9,10 metal sulfides,11,12 metal–organic frameworks (MOFs),13 graphene oxides,14 graphene nitrides,15etc.1,16 Nevertheless, traditional photocatalysts suffer from low surface-reactive reaction sites, inefficient light harvesting and rapid recombination of electron–hole pairs, which causes their photocatalytic activity to deteriorate.17,18
Recently, lead halide perovskites and their derivatives have received substantial attention as photocatalytic materials in the applications of CO2 reduction, especially 2D organic–inorganic hybrid lead halide perovskites, due mainly to their highly tailorable structural and physicochemical properties, such as strong visible light absorption, large specific surface area and long charge-carrier diffusion lengths.4,19–23 The 2D perovskites can be described stoichiometrically by the formula L2An−1PbnX3n+1, where L is ligand cations (e.g., BA = C4H9NH3+), A is organic or inorganic cations (e.g., MA = CH3NH3+ and Cs+), X is halogen anions (e.g., Cl−, Br− or I−), and the integer n presents the layer number of perovskite units.24 The 2D network consists of inorganic perovskite layers of corner-sharing [PbX6]4− octahedra sandwiched by two insulating ligand layers to form multiple quantum wells. The unit layers are held together by a combination of Coulombic and hydrophobic interactions to maintain the integrity of the structure.25 Unlike the small cations in 3D perovskites APbX3 (e.g., A is MA+, or Cs+), the large organic molecules in 2D perovskites separate inorganic sheets, affording the properties of both discrete molecules and extended solids in single, well-defined materials.26,27 Due to the presence of stable excitons in 2D perovskites,25 combined with their soft lattice and carrier-related polarization properties, 2D perovskites have extremely exotic photophysical properties.28–32 In a 3D perovskite, excitons have binding energies of 5–60 meV, while 2D perovskites have higher binding energies of approximately 100–500 meV.32,33 Despite the high binding energy, a thermally activated interconversion process between bound excitons and free carriers has been discovered in 2D perovskites at room temperature: recent works by Sun et al. reported ultrafast (<1.4 ps) and highly efficient (>80%) internal exciton dissociation in 2D perovskites.24 Due to the soft lattice and polar semiconductor characteristics of 2D perovskites, they exhibit strong exciton–phonon coupling,34 which can readily lead to the formation of large exciton–polarons. The exciton dissociation activity in 2D perovskites is significantly promoted because of the formation of exciton–polarons with considerably reduced exciton binding energy (down to a few tens of meV) by the polaronic screening effect.24 This finding explains their exceptional performance in photovoltaic devices, as is also proven by the work of Giulia Folpini28 and Tao35et al. In summary, compared with conventional 3D perovskite nanocrystals, 2D layered perovskites exhibit unique advantages, including the following: (1) the 2D perovskites exhibit unique and much better humidity resistance because of the long hydrophobic insulating ligands.22,24,29,36 (2) 2D perovskites possess a larger surface-area-to-volume ratio in comparison with bulk materials, affording abundant active sites for CO2 reduction.2,37,38 (3) The 2D dimensionality modifies the electronic structure of bulk materials due to the quantum confinement effect.2 (4) Ultrathin thickness favours the transfer of photogenerated carriers from the interior to the surface, thus decreasing bulk recombination.38 (5) The ultrafast and high-yield exciton dissociation in 2D perovskites can promote electron–hole separation, charge transport, and collection.24 These unique advantages are expected to improve the performance of photocatalytic CO2 reduction.
Photocatalytic CO2 reduction is a complex process with multiple products and the selective conversion of CO2 to valuable fuel remains challenging.39 Many factors influence the results of the photoinduced reduction of CO2, of which the photocatalyst, the reaction medium, the light source and the design of the photocatalytic reaction system are the most important.40 Considerable effort for decades has been devoted to investigating the performance of CO2 conversion by photocatalysts, and several strategies have been reported to strengthen the advantages of 2D materials and improve CO2 conversion, including elemental doping,8,41 heterojunction construction,6,7,42–49 molecule self-assembly,50 surface modification,51–54 nanostrucutralization,2,16 and dimensionality reduction.17,20,38,55,56 Although many studies have focused on structure or material modification, very few studies have been carried out on the selection of the appropriate reaction solvent or light source.2,40 Therefore, in addition to the modification of photocatalysts, it is urgent to study the external conditions, such as the reaction medium, light source intensity and wavelength, which affect CO2 reduction in photocatalytic systems. In addition, exciton generation is another important factor for photocatalysts.4 Photogenerated carriers have been widely studied, as these carriers are closely related to many practical applications in recent years.36 Most of the photogenerated carriers focus on exciton dynamics to explain their excellent characteristics in solar cells, photodetectors and luminescence applications. However, there are few studies on how to improve the photocatalytic performance based on the characteristics of 2D perovskite excitons.
In this work, a series of L2Csn−1PbnX3n+1 (L = ba, ha, oa; X = Cl, Br, I; n = 1, 2) 2D perovskites suitable for liquid–solid photocatalytic reaction systems were synthesized by a simple solvothermal method and used as photocatalysts for efficient CO2 photoreduction without any sacrificial agents. As expected, in contrast to traditional 3D CsPbBr3 perovskite, these 2D perovskite nanosheets exhibit significantly improved stability and activity for photocatalytic CO2 reduction, achieving the highest CO yield of 158.69 μmol g−1 h−1 and CH4 yield of 6.9 μmol g−1 h−1 with (ha)2CsPb2Br7 as the photocatalyst. In addition, the influence of light source conditions on photocatalysis was studied systematically, including light source intensity and wavelength. The increase in the intensity of the light source is helpful for the improvement of CO2 reduction efficiency. According to the optical absorption behaviour of the 2D perovskite exciton, monochromic light with different wavelengths were selected, and we further found that the wavelength matching of light source to the exciton absorption can effectively improve the photocatalytic efficiency.
2. Results and discussion
2.1. Synthesis and characterization
A series of L2Csn−1PbnX3n+1 (L = ba, ha, oa; X = Cl, Br, I; n = 1, 2) 2D organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite crystallites were synthesized at a relatively low temperature (100 °C) through a simple solvothermal method in toluene. Three types of organic monoamine cations (butylammonium, hexylammonium, and octylammonium, abbreviated as ba+, ha+, oa+) and Cs+ were utilized as large organic spacers and small cations, respectively. Chloride, bromide and iodide were used as anions. Ten kinds of organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites were successfully synthesized, of which nine were double-layered and one was single-layered. The crystal structures and purity of the 2D perovskites were confirmed with powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis (Fig. 1 and Fig. S1†). A series of strong (00l) periodic diffraction peaks are observed in the XRD patterns, indicating that the patterns conform to the characteristics of highly oriented 2D single-layered perovskites. In particular, the characteristic peak (00l) is located near 5°, which have been reported as an important feature of 2D perovskites.57–62 Compared with the 3D perovskites, these 2D layer-structured perovskite materials clearly demonstrate preferential orientations along the c-axis because (00l) diffraction peaks dominate the diffraction patterns, and strong and sharp diffraction peaks reveal the good crystallinity of these materials.61,63–65 The XRD pattern of 2D perovskite with n = 2 is compared with the standard data of the possible inorganic impurities CsPbBr3 and CsPb2Br5 (Fig. 1b). There is no obvious impurity peak, which proved that the synthesized n = 2 phase (ha)2CsPb2Br7 is pure phase as a whole. The detailed XRD peak data is shown in Fig. S1d and Table S1,† and the observed XRD results are consistent with the reported ones of (HA)2(A)Pb2I7,66 PA2CsPb2I767 and (BA)2(MA)Pb2I7.36,61 The estimated lattice distance of the first diffraction peak in the 2D perovskite crystals with n = 1 is well correlated with the stepwise increase in the length of the organic cations (Fig. S1a–c†). As the halogen atoms of the inorganic layer change from Cl to I, the estimated lattice distance of the first diffraction peak gradually decreases (Fig. 1a). When the number of inorganic layers n increases from 1 to 2, the crystal cell expands, and the diffraction peak moves to a lower diffraction angle, which conforms to Bragg's law.63,65

Taking (ha)2Csn−1PbnBr3n+1 (n = 1, 2) as an example, the perovskite structure models are shown in Fig. 2. The XRD peaks are at regular intervals of 5.0° and 3.7° for the n = 1 and n = 2 perovskites, corresponding to average spacing between layered nanoplatelets of 1.8 and 2.4 nm, respectively. The organic layers and the inorganic frames are periodically arranged, forming a sandwich-like structure. The inorganic layers consisting of corner-sharing [PbX6]4− octahedra networked in two dimensions are separated by organic ligand layers, which are ∼0.6 nm in thickness.62,68,69 Therefore, the organic layers occupy a space of ∼1.2 nm in height (Fig. 2a) so that the inorganic frame part of the n = 2 perovskites is ∼1.2 nm thick, approximately two times the thickness of [PbX6]4− octahedral layer, with one full unit cell contained within (Fig. 2b). These XRD measurements show that the synthesized n = 2 perovskites are actually a two-layer metal halide octahedron with a complete unit cell and have not grown into thicker analogues (n > 2).

To further analyse the chemical composition of the synthesized 2D perovskites, the content of C, H, N and Pb were detected (Table S2†). Quantitative analysis shows that the experimental values of the elements are close to the theoretical values, which further verifies the chemical formula of perovskites. The morphological features of the as-prepared 2D perovskites were then investigated with scanning electron microscopy (SEM). As shown in Fig. 3a and Fig. S2,† all perovskites show a plate-like morphology and exhibit typical layered structures. The energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) results reveal that the 2D perovskites consist of Cs, Pb, and X (X = Cl, Br, I) elements. TEM studies further confirmed the quasi-2D morphology of these perovskites. The monolayer perovskites show a belt-like morphology (Fig. S3a–c†), and the length and width are ca. 150–250 nm and 30–50 nm, respectively, which are much smaller than the length and width of two-layer perovskites. For the two-layer perovskite, (ha)2CsPb2Br7 exhibits a distinct plate-like morphology with a width of ca. 1 μm (Fig. 3b). From the HRTEM measurement of (ha)2CsPb2Br7 (Fig. 3c), interplanar distances of 0.285 nm and 0.406 nm can be clearly identified, corresponding to the (220) and (111) crystal faces, respectively, coinciding with the XRD data in Table S1.† The corresponding diffraction spots (marked with blue circles and red circles) can also be found in the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (Fig. 3d). For monolayer perovskites (ha)2PbX4 (X = Cl, Br, I), the crystal lattice fringes are clearly visible, and the fast Fourier transform (FFT) patterns show a series of ordered spots (Fig. S3d–f†), indicating the high crystallinity of individual 2D perovskite.

High-resolution Pb 4f XPS (X ray photoelectron spectrum) peaks are homogeneous and symmetric in shape, and the corresponding binding energy data indicate the presence of Pb in the 2+ oxidation state (Fig. S4b, e, h and S5b†). However, possibly due to beam damage during measurement or the presence of small impurities, (ha)2PbI4 contains a small amount of metal Pb.70,71 The Cl 2p, Br 3d and I 3d XPS peaks are fitted into two groups, manifesting the formation of Pb–X bonding, with the low-energy and high-energy peaks corresponding to internal and surface ions, respectively.60,72 In the quantitative analysis table of XPS (Table S3†), the Pb and X atomic ratio of monolayer perovskite is approximately 1:4, and the atomic ratios of Cs, Pb, and Br in two layers of perovskite are 3.47%, 6.34% and 24.93%, respectively, coinciding with the chemical formula.
Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption and photoluminescence (PL) spectra of these 2D perovskite samples in hexane were collected (Fig. 4 and Fig. S6†). The absorbance spectra each show a well-defined excitonic feature, which also confirms the phase purity of the prepared samples.66 The alkylamine chain length-related optical properties of monolayer perovskites were studied and shown in Fig. S6.† We found a blueshift tendency in the first absorption peaks (as well as the PL peaks) with the chain length of alkylamine, which is attributed to the quantum confinement effect caused by the vertical dimension decrease. These (ha)2PbCl4 perovskites have peak absorption at 339 nm and peak emission at 349 nm (Fig. 4). By substituting bromide for chloride, the peak absorption/emission for (ha)2PbBr4 perovskites is redshifted to 339/405 nm. Once again, substituting iodide for bromide, the peak absorption/emission for (ha)2PbI4 perovskites is shifted to 519/528 nm. These strong absorptions are belonged to the charge transfer transitions in the inorganic layers.73 As shown in the Tauc plots (Fig. S7†), the detected optical bandgaps of (ha)2PbCl4, (ha)2PbBr4, (ha)2CsPb2Br7 and (ha)2PbI4 are at 3.68 eV, 3.10 eV, 2.82 eV and 2.29 eV, respectively, all showing the feature of direct band gap semiconductor.73 Unlike classical 3D perovskites, these 2D perovskites are quantum confined because of their layered crystal structures. The 2D crystal structure forming natural quantum wells leads to various degrees of quantum confinement, which provides a clear distinction of the n-value of the 2D perovskite phases in the UV-vis and PL spectra.66,74,75 The absorbance and PL spectra of (ha)2PbBr4 (n = 1) clearly show blueshifted peaks relative to the n = 2 phase (Fig. 4). As n increases, the bandgap energy of the 2D perovskite decreases from 3.10 eV for n = 1 to 2.82 eV for n = 2 (Fig. S7b and c†) because of the reduction in the quantum confinement degree and dielectric screening effect, consistent with the rule that the bandgap decreases as the number of inorganic perovskite layers in multilayer compounds increases.74 The strong excitonic resonance absorption peaks and narrow PL spectra indicate the exciton nature of carriers in these 2D perovskites.24 The stability of the as-prepared perovskites could be evidenced by XRD patterns and UV-vis absorption spectra (Fig. S8†). We found that the XRD patterns showed little change for several days, indicating that the as-prepared perovskites remained stable in the ambient environment, as further shown by the UV-vis absorption spectra, which also show little change, confirming the high photostability. The excellent stability of the 2D perovskites could be attributed to their long and hydrophobic organic chains, and the organic ligands on their surface play a vital role in stabilization and functionalization.60,76

2.2. Photocatalytic system construction and testing
To assess the photocatalytic performance of 2D perovskites, we performed photocatalytic CO2 reduction experiments in a liquid–solid system containing CO2 gas without any sacrificial agent. The conversion of CO2 to a selective product in high yield depends significantly on the photocatalyst and the reaction medium it operates within. To select the appropriate photocatalytic reaction system, 16 photocatalytic systems were designed by combining 4 photocatalysts and 4 solvents in pairs. Considering that the organic layer has little effect on the light absorption capacity of perovskite (Fig. S6†), (ha)2PbX4 (X = Cl, Br, I) and (ha)2CsPb2Br7 perovskites were selected as photocatalysts. The choice of solvent is extremely crucial in the photocatalytic pathway. Many organic solvents have been explored, such as acetonitrile,5,6 ethyl acetate,6–8,19,41,77 and toluene.43 During photocatalytic CO2 reduction studies, we chose butyl acetate (BAC), ethyl acetate (EAC), toluene (TL) and cyclohexane (CYH) as solvents to prove the effects of the solvent on the product selectivity and the catalyst activity. The catalytic reaction was carried out in CO2-saturated organic solvents, while CO was detected as the major carbonaceous product, and CH4 as a side product for both (ha)2PbBr4 and (ha)2CsPb2Br7. No H2 was detected during the reaction, and all the data were obtained by deducting the corresponding blank experimental data for organic solvents. The outputs of all products grow almost linearly with prolonged reaction time (Fig. S9a–d†). As shown in Fig. S9g,† no reduction product was detected for (ha)2PbI4 because the compound could not exist stably in BAC and EAC, and XPS results also confirmed its instability (Fig. S4h†). The XRD patterns and UV-vis absorption spectra after the reaction show that the other three perovskites were stable in all solvents (Fig. S10†). In the system with (ha)2PbBr4/(ha)2CsPb2Br7 as the catalyst and BAC/EAC as the solvent, the CO yield was much higher than the yield in the other systems (Fig. 5). Specifically, the highest product yield was obtained in the system with (ha)2CsPb2Br7 as the photocatalyst and BAC as the solvent (158.69 μmol g−1 h−1 for CO and 6.9 μmol g−1 h−1 for CH4) after 4 h of continuous illumination (Fig. S9h†). We summarized the recent works of the halide perovskites for photocatalytic CO2 reduction, which was shown in Table S4.† The yield of (ha)2CsPb2Br7 photocatalyst was better than most pure perovskite photocatalysts, and even better than some composites although the experimental conditions were different. This result can be attributed to that (ha)2PbBr4 and (ha)2CsPb2Br7 perovskites have high stability and dispersion in ester solvents and the solubility of CO2 in these solvents is high.6,7 In addition, 2D perovskites possess a larger surface-area-to-volume ratio than bulk materials to allow more CO2 adsorption.2 And it is expected to enhance the advantages of 2D perovskites by compounding them with other materials to improve the photocatalytic CO2 reduction performance. Therefore, in the following experiments, BAC was used as the solvent, and (ha)2PbBr4/(ha)2CsPb2Br7 was used as the photocatalyst.

2.3. Photocatalysis effect for light intensity and the wavelength matching of light source to the exaction absorption
Subsequently, the effect of light source intensity on the performance of photocatalytic reduction of CO2 was investigated with (ha)2CsPb2Br7 as the photocatalyst and BAC as the solvent (300 W Xe lamp, full wavelength). The main product was CO under different light source intensities, and a small amount of CH4 was detected at higher light intensities (300 mW and 400 mW) (Fig. 6a). With increasing reaction time and light source intensity, the product yield increases approximately linearly (Fig. 6b), which can be interpreted as increasing the light source intensity contributing to improving the light absorption of the hybrids. Compared with 3D perovskites, 2D perovskites show a narrow visible light response due to the quantum size effect (Fig. 4). To compensate for the loss of light absorption and preserve the active specific surface area of the 2D perovskite, monochromic light sources were used instead of the full wavelength. The influence of the wavelength of the light source on the performance of photocatalytic reduction of CO2 was investigated by using bandpass filters with 20 nm width. Monochromatic light experiments were performed at the same light intensity, but the light intensity would be greatly reduced after adding filters. Due to the limitation of device space and xenon lamp current, monochromatic light studies can only be performed at low light intensity (50 mW) at present. According to the UV-vis absorption spectra of (ha)2CsPb2Br7 (exciton absorption peak is at 435 nm, Fig. 4), four monochromatic light sources with central wavelengths of 400, 435, 500 and 600 nm were used to explore the photocatalytic effect. As shown in Fig. 7a, the wavelength range of the light source has a significant impact on the activity of photocatalytic CO2 reduction to CO. Only CO was detected under different monochromic light sources, mainly due to GC detection is limited and it is likely that C2 or other products are present, but we cannot detect them at this time. The photocatalytic CO2 reduction to CH4 is an 8e− process that requires active H and the reaction to generate C–H bonds must be fast, which is difficult.78 If there is no substance in the system that can provide active H, the reaction can only stop at the stage of CO production. The highest CO generation of 21.47 μmol g−1 could be achieved by the monochromic light source with the central wavelength of 435 nm matched with the exciton absorption peak. In addition, comparing the CO yield under the full-wavelength light source with the monochromic light sources under the same intensity, we found that the catalyst activity was still the highest for the latter (Fig. 7b), approximately 1.27 times the activity of the former. Using (ha)2PbBr4 (exciton absorption peak at 399 nm, Fig. 4) as the catalyst (monochromic light source with central wavelengths of 365, 400, 450 and 600 nm), the highest CO yield was obtained under the light source with a central wavelength of 400 nm matched with the exciton absorption peak (Fig. S11†), which confirmed the previous conclusion. With better resolution of exciton peaks and higher absorption values in the absorption spectrum, the optical absorption utilization of 2D perovskite materials can be effectively improved by using a monochromatic light source matching the exciton absorption peaks at the same light intensity.79 More electron–hole pairs can be dissociated quickly, and carrier mobility can be improved so that CO2 reduction is carried out efficiently.

2.4. Photocatalyst stability
When the catalytic stability of the catalyst was considered, the as-prepared 2D perovskite photocatalyst was found to display good cycling stability. To evaluate the stability of the composites, three consecutive runs of 4 h each were performed on (ha)2CsPb2Br7 (Fig. 8). The photocatalytic activity decreased slightly, and the CO and CH4 production decreased by 13.1% and 10.5%, respectively, after three cycles (Fig. S12†). The XRD pattern after photocatalysis showed that the intensity of the XRD diffraction peaks decreased and slightly broadened after photocatalysis (Fig. S13a†), so the decrease in photoactivity after third cycle may be due to a mild deactivation of the photocatalyst. However, the characteristic peak at 3.7° of the (ha)2CsPb2Br7 photocatalyst was still strong and sharp, while the characteristic exciton peak in the UV-vis absorption spectrum had no obvious change(Fig. S13b†), indicating that the photocatalyst could still maintain the layered structure and light collection ability under the reaction conditions.

2.5. Photocatalytic mechanism exploration
To further confirm the photocatalytic role of the (ha)2CsPb2Br7 perovskites, we carried out a controllable photocatalytic reaction with (ha)2CsPb2Br7 in BAC (300 W Xe lamp, 400 mW, full wavelength). During photocatalytic CO2 reduction in the dark or without a photocatalyst, there will then be no or very little CO and CH4 generation (Fig. S14,† green and blue lines), which suggests the specificity of the photocatalytic reaction. Furthermore, with N2 instead of saturated CO2 as the filler atmosphere, CO and CH4 were recorded under the same illumination, with corresponding yields of 32.63 and 1.37 μmol g−1 h−1, respectively (Fig. S14,† red lines), indicating that the solar fuel products are mainly from CO2. Meanwhile, in the absence of photocatalyst, only CO was detected with a yield of 4.38 μmol g−1 h−1 (Fig. S14,† pink lines), which should be the result of the partial photo-oxidation of BAC, demonstrating a possible oxidation of the solvent, as previously reported.20
Therefore, based on the above experimental results, a possible photocatalytic mechanism is proposed and summarized in Fig. 9. The ability of 2D perovskite to achieve efficient CO2 reduction is due to its unique layered structure with a large specific surface area that provides an abundance of active sites.2 The presence of the organic layer enable (ha)2CsPb2Br7 perovskite powder to be fully dispersed in BAC enriched with a high concentration of CO2, achieving a rapid accumulation of CO2 between the hybrid layers and full contact with the inorganic layer, effectively shortening the distance for electrons to reach the active sites on the surface.6,7,20 Under light excitation, the electrons and holes in the exciton state within the [PbBr6]4−n inorganic layer are separated, and the photogenerated electrons are rapidly captured by the CO2 enriched in the interlayer to produce CO and CH4 in a reduction reaction while holes are trapped by BAC for the oxidation reaction. The more detailed mechanism is still being explored.

3. Conclusions
In summary, a series of L2Csn−1PbnX3n+1 (L = ba, ha, oa; X = Cl, Br, I; n = 1, 2) 2D layered perovskites was successfully synthesized by a simple solvothermal method and were used as photocatalysts for the reduction of CO2 without any sacrificial agents. Benefitting from the large surface-area-to-volume ratio and ultrafast and efficient exciton dissociation, 2D layered perovskites show significantly higher activity for photocatalytic CO2 reduction than the reported pure 3D CsPbBr3 perovskites. Production rates of 158.69 μmol g−1 h−1 for CO and 6.9 μmol g−1 h−1 for CH4 were achieved using (ha)2CsPb2Br7 perovskites as photocatalyst. In addition, the wavelength matching of the monochromic light to the exciton absorption can elevate the performance of (ha)2CsPb2Br7 perovskites for the photocatalytic CO2 reduction. We believe that the findings in this work provide a guideline for the design and rational utilization of 2D perovskites in photocatalytic CO2 reduction and provide evidence for the study of the exciton role in photocatalytic applications.
4. Experimental section
4.1. Materials
PbCl2 (AR, 99.5%), PbBr2 (AR, 99%), PbI2 (AR, 98%), and caesium acetate (CsOAc, AR, 99%) were purchased from Shanghai Macklin Biochemical Co., Ltd. Butylamine (C4H11N, GC, ≥99%), hexylamine (C6H15N, AR, 99%), octylamine (C8H19N, AR, 99%), HBr (AR, 40 wt%), HI (AR, ≥47.0 wt%, ≤1.5 wt% H3PO2), hexane (C6H14, AR, 97%), butyl acetate (C6H12O2, AR, 99.5%), ethyl acetate (C4H8O2, AR, 99%), and cyclohexane (C6H12, AR, 99.5%) were purchased from Shanghai Aladdin Biochemical Technology Co., Ltd and HCl (AR, 36.0–38.0 wt%), toluene (C7H8, AR, ≥99.5%) were received from Beijing Tongguang Fine Chemicals Company. These chemicals and reagents were used as received without further purification.
4.2. Synthesis of 2D L2Csn−1PbnX3n+1 (L = ba, ha, oa; X = Cl, Br, I; n = 1, 2) perovskites
The L2Csn−1PbnX3n+1 (L = butylamine, hexylamine and octylamine, denoted as ba, ha, and oa, respectively; n = 1 and 2) hybrids were synthesized by a solvothermal method with PbX2 (X = Cl, Br, I) and CsOAc as the reactants in the presence of the respective alkylamine.

4.2.1 Synthesis of L2PbX4 (L = ba, ha, oa; X = Cl, Br, I) perovskites. 
In a typical experiment for L2PbBr4, 0.3670 g (1.0 mmol) of PbBr2 and 1 mL of HBr were mixed with 16 mL of toluene. Subsequently, 2.0 mmol of monoamine (198, 265, 331 μL of ba, ha, oa, respectively) was added to the mixture. After stirring for 30 minutes, the mixture was then sealed in a 20 mL Teflon-lined autoclave and heated at 100 °C for 2 days. To remove excess organic ligands, the products were washed with hexane, and then the mixture was centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 3 min. The washing-centrifugation procedure was repeated three to five times. Then, the samples were dried under vacuum to obtain white L2PbBr4 (L = ba, ha, oa) single-crystal powders. All other chloride and iodide derivatives were synthesized using a similar procedure.


4.2.2 Synthesis of (ha)2CsPb2Br7 perovskites. 
All the steps were the same as above except for the solution preparation. A total of 0.7340 g (2.0 mmol) of PbBr2 and 0.1920 g (1.0 mmol) CsOAc were mixed with 16 mL of toluene. The solution gradually turned yellow and became turbid, indicating the crystallization and growth of CsPbBr3. Subsequently, 1 mL of HBr and 278 μL of hexylamine were added to the mixture.

4.3. Characterization of the 2D hybrid perovskites
Powder X-ray diffraction was measured using a PANalytical X'Pert Pro multipurpose diffractometer under the following conditions: 40 kV, 40 mA, and Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.541844 Å), a step size of 0.0330°/2θ, a scanning range of 2θ = 2–60° and a count time of 59.6900 s per step. Elemental analyses of C, H and N were carried out with an Elementary Vario EL instrument (Germany). The amount of lead in solution was detected by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were acquired on a Thermofisher ESCALAB 250Xi. All binding energies were corrected by fitting the C 1s peak of surface adventitious carbon at 284.5 eV. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) imaging was conducted on a field emission 20 scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM; SU-8000, Hitachi) at an acceleration voltage of 10 kV. TEM images were obtained using an FEI Talos F200S and TEM operated at 200 kV. The sample in hexane solution (∼5 μL) was directly dropped onto a 300 mesh copper TEM grid and dried under vacuum conditions. The liquid ultraviolet-vis (UV-vis) absorption spectra were collected in the range from 300 to 700 nm by using a Shimadzu UV-2600 spectrophotometer. PL spectra were measured using an FS5 Fluorescence Spectrometer (Edinburgh Instruments, UK). Solid state UV-vis spectra were performed on U-3900H Spectrophotometer operating from 240 to 800 nm region and the 100% reflectance was based on BaSO4.
4.4. Photocatalytic CO2 reduction
In a typical experiment, the photocatalysts (33 mg) were suspended in organic solvents (35 mL), then loaded into a 150 mL Pyrex photoreactor. The photoreactor was sealed with a rubber septum and purged with high purity CO2 (99.99%) gas for 15 min to eliminate the air in the reactor. The photoreactor was then stirred and irradiated by a 300 W Xe lamp (light source experiment with filters). The light intensity was measured with an optical power meter before each irradiation. After every 0.5 h of light irradiation, the evolved gas product (1 mL) was detected using a gas chromatograph (GC-7920, N2 carrier, China Education Au-light) with a flame ionization detector. The amount of hydrogen was determined by a Fuli GC9790II online gas chromatograph (thermal conductivity detector (TCD), N2 carrier, MS-5 Å column).

4.4.1 Photocatalytic system construction and testing. 
The photocatalytic CO2 reduction system was constructed by using layered inorganic/organic (ha)2Csn−1PbnX3n+1(X = Cl, Br, I; n = 1, 2) hybrids as photocatalysts and BAC, EAC, TL, and CYH as solvents. The photocatalytic performance of the layered hybrids was systematically studied by changing the type of organic solvent, the intensity of the light source, and the wavelength range of the light source. Four kinds of photocatalysts [(ha)2PbX4 (X = Cl, Br, I) and (ha)2CsPb2Br7] and 4 kinds of organic solvents (BAC, EAC, TL, CYH) were combined separately to construct 16 kinds of photocatalytic reduction CO2 combination systems. The reaction continued for 4 h under irradiation with a 300 W xenon lamp (light intensity 400 mW). After the reaction, the sample was collected and treated at 60 °C in vacuum for further characterization.


4.4.2 Photocatalysis effect for light intensity and monochromic light source. 
Using (ha)2CsPb2Br7 perovskite as the photocatalyst and BAC as the solvent, 4 h experiments were carried out under 300 W xenon lamp irradiation with 50, 100, 200, 300, and 400 mW light intensity. Using BAC as the solvent, (ha)2PbBr4 and (ha)2CsPb2Br7 perovskite were used as photocatalysts. The reaction lasted for 4 hours under irradiation with a 300 W xenon lamp and bandpass filter (the light source bandwidth was 20 nm, and the central wavelengths were 365, 400, 435, 450, 500, and 600 nm). Before the experiment, the light intensity was adjusted to 50 mW.


4.4.3 Photocatalyst stability. 
Under irradiation with a 300 W xenon lamp (light intensity 400 mW), photocatalytic cycling tests were performed for CO2 reduction to evaluate the stability and reusability of the abovementioned hybrids. In this experiment, (ha)2CsPb2Br7 was dispersed in BAC to a three-cycle experiment (the time of one cycle was 4 h). Between the runs, the reactor was evacuated and refilled with CO2. After photostability measurement, the sample was collected and treated at 60 °C under vacuum.
