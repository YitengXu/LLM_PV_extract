Introduction
Nano/microstructured TiO2 has received enormous attention from scientists and engineers in the past decades, owing to its important applications in photocatalysis for environmental cleanup, solar cells, clean H2 energy production, antimicrobial activity etc.1 Recently, selective photocatalysis is of particular interest because it might open new potential fields of applications such as separation processes, selective elimination of pollutants from a mixture, selective oxidation of organic compounds for fine organic synthesis, molecular recognition etc.2–5 Several strategies have been developed to achieve selective photocatalytic reactions on titania through the control of substrates' access to active sites, or adsorption selectivity, which is a potentially versatile methodology to impart substrate selectivity in the photocatalytic reaction. The strategies include modifying titania surface with fluoration and NaOH washing,6,7 embedding nano titania in mesoporous silica or zeolite,8–10 coating titania with organic compound or molecular-imprinted organic polymer,11,12 using layered titanate for selective adsorption5etc. However, photocatalytic reactions on titania are often accompanied by the formation of highly reactive hydroxyl radicals (·OH) that are typically nonselective,1 thus highly selective photocatalysis is hardly achieved.
Defects in metal oxides play a crucial role in heterogeneous catalysis, adsorption, sensing etc. The defects (e.g., oxygen vacancies) in TiO2 have been theoretically studied with first-principles calculations,13 and experimentally studied by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and positron annihilation.14–19 It has been revealed by these studies that the defects greatly influence electronic properties13 as well as surface reactivity and adsorption of H2O, CO2 and O2 on TiO2, and photocatalytic activity.14–19 Surface defects can serve as charge carrier traps as well as adsorption sites in photocatalysis. In principle, selective adsorption of molecules and the trapping of photogenerated charge carriers on the defect sites of titania may change the photocatalytic pathway, thus considerably influence the photocatalytic selectivity. Therefore, it is of scientific and technological significance to achieve highly selective photocatalysis and molecular recognition through the control of defects in titania, which may open a new area in the rational design of novel materials for specific practical applications. Herein, we synthesized novel 2D-ordered dome films of nano titania and nano Ag2+ doped titania with an abundance of oxygen vacancies or Ti3+ ions by RF magnetron sputtering method. It was found that for cationic crystal violet (CV) and anionic methyl orange (MO), the 2D-ordered dome films exhibit 100% photodegradation selectivity to the cationic CV and unique ratiometric photoelectrochemical sensing property with 100% selectivity to CV. Furthermore, Ag2+ doping in the 2D-TiO2 dome film significantly improves the photocatalytic activity and photoelectrochemical sensitivity as it considerably enhances the electron transfer efficiency from excited dye to titania.
Experimental section
Preparation
Glass or ITO glass slides (0.95 × 3.4 cm) used for the experiment were first treated with a mixture of 1.0 mol L−1KOH isopropanol solution for 2 h, washed with distilled water, and finally dried by flushing nitrogen-gas. The glass or ITO glass slide was placed on an experimental bench. Thirty μl of latex dispersion was dropped on the glass slide, and spread uniformly on the whole area of the slide with the tip of the pipette. After the water was evaporated at ambient temperature, 3D-ordered latex film was formed on the glass slide.
2D-ordered dome films of nano titania and nano Ag2+ doped titania were prepared by RF magnetron sputtering method using the as-prepared 3D-ordered latex film on glass or ITO substrate as template. TiO2 or 5 at%AgO/TiO2 disks were used as the RF magnetron sputtering targets. The cathode–substrate distance is equal to 8.5 cm. The RF magnetron sputtering chamber was evacuated to 3.0 × 10−3 Pa with a turbo molecular pump backed up with a mechanical pump before film deposition. The substrate temperature, which was monitored by a thermocouple fixed on the backside of substrate holder, was kept at ambient temperature during sputtering. The sputtering power was 80 W, and the sputtering time was 20 min. After RF magnetron sputtering, the latex moiety was removed by temperature-programmed calcination in air in a muffle furnace. The film was heated to 450 °C at a rate of 1.2 °C min−1, and kept at the temperature for 2 h.

          TiO2 film as a reference photocatalyst was prepared according to the following procedure. TiO2 (P25, Deggussa Co.) powder was added to ethanol, and ultrasonicated for 5 min. Several drops of poly(ethylene glycol, average M.W. 570–630) was added, and ground in an agate mortar. The obtained mixture was uniformly spread on an ITO glass substrate (0.95 × 3.4 cm). After the evaporation of ethanol, the sample was heated to 450 °C in a muffle furnace, and kept at this temperature for 2 h to completely remove poly(ethylene glycol).
Characterization

          Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were obtained by using a Hitachi S-4800 scanning electron microscope. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained by using a JEM-100CX electron microscope. For preparing TEM grid with the film, the film was scratched from the glass substrate, and then dispersed in ethanol. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were acquired by an ESCALab MK2 X-ray photoelectron spectrometer. Mg-Kα radiation was selected as the X-ray source. The spectra of the films were collected and corrected by referencing the binding energy to carbon (C1s, 284.6 eV). X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained on a Rigaku D/Max-IIIA X-ray diffractometer using Cu-Kα radiation. Diffusive reflectance UV-vis(DRUV-vis) absorption spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-3600 spectrophotometer.
Photoelectrochemical measurements were carried out by using a homemade three-electrode quartz cell, Pt wire as the counter electrode, a saturated Ag/AgCl electrode as the reference electrode, and the 2D-ordered dome film on ITO as the working electrode on an electrochemical analyzer (CHI750). The electrolyte used was a solution of 0.2 mol L−1Na2SO4 and dye with different concentrations. The bias potential applied to the electrode of the 2D-ordered dome film is −0.5 V. A 500 W Xe lamp system (CHF-XM500, Beijing Changtuo Co., denoted as Xe lamp) was used as light source. To measure the photocurrent under visible irradiation (λ > 400 nm), a UV cut-filter, which can filter out UV light with wavelengths below 400 nm, was placed between the lamp and cell. The intensity of UV light in the region of 320–400 nm emitted from the Xe lamp was measured with a UV-A radiometer. The intensity of visible-infrared light in the region of 400–1000 nm emitted from the Xe lamp was measured with an FZ-A radiometer. The UV (320–400 nm) and visible-infrared (400–1000 nm) intensity irradiated on the photocatalyst film on substrate are 1.0 × 104 and 1.8 × 105 μW cm−2, respectively.
The formation of hydroxyl radicals (•OH) in the presence of the 2D-Ag-TiO2 film under UV-visible irradiation was detected by the PL technique using terephthalic acid as a probe molecule, which readily reacts with •OH to produce highly fluorescent product, 2-hydroxyterephthalic acid.20 The experimental procedure was as follows. The 2D-Ag-TiO2 film on the glass substrate was immersed in 2.5 mL of aqueous solution of 1.0 × 10−4 mol L−1terephthalic acid and 4.0 × 10−4 mol L−1NaOH in a quartz cell at ambient temperature. A Xe lamp was used as a light source. At the intervals of given irradiation time, the film was taken out from the cell, and PL spectra of the 2-hydroxyterephthalic acid produced were recorded on a Shimadzu RF-5301 PC spectrometer using 315 nm excitation light.
Photocatalytic activity test
The photocatalytic activity of the 2D-ordered dome films was evaluated by the photodegradation of dyes. The light source was a Xe lamp. The reaction was maintained at ambient temperature. In a typical experiment, aqueous suspensions of dye (2.5 mL, 1.0 × 10−5 mol L−1) were placed in a quartz cell. The 2D-ordered dome film on the glass substrate was immersed in the dye solution. Prior to irradiation, the dye solution was kept in the dark to ensure the establishment of an adsorption/desorption equilibrium. Then, the Xe lamp was turned on. At the intervals of given irradiation time, the 2D-ordered dome film was taken out from the cell, and the UV-vis absorbance of the dye aqueous solution was measured to determine the dye concentration. The procedure for the recycled experiments of the 2D-Ag-TiO2 film is as follows. After the first photodegradation test that lasted for 2 h as described above, the film was taken out from the quartz cell, and placed in another quartz cell with aqueous suspensions of dye (2.5 mL, 1.0 × 10−5 mol L−1). The Xe lamp was again turned on to start the next photodegradation test. The procedure was repeated for known times.
Results and discussion
Characterization
2D-ordered dome film of nano Ag2+ doped titania (2D-Ag-TiO2) was prepared by depositing AgO/TiO2 composite thin film on the 3D-ordered latex film on a glass or ITO glass substrate by RF magnetron sputtering method using 5 at%AgO/TiO2 disk as the RF magnetron sputtering targets, followed by removing the template by temperature-programmed calcination. Fig. 1a shows a top view of the SEM image of the 2D-Ag-TiO2 film. The top surface is composed of a closely packed, hexagonal AgO/TiO2 array with diameter of 350.0 nm. A cross-section SEM image as shown in Fig. 1b exhibits one layer of ordered domes with a height of 125 nm, indicating that the 2D-Ag-TiO2 film has 2D-ordered dome morphology. Previously, we used layer-by-layer casting of TiO2 or Fe2O3 precursor to prepare 3D-ordered TiO2 and Fe2O3 film. As TiO2 or Fe2O3 precursor (e.g., Ti(OBu)4 or FeCl3 ethanol solution) could homogeneously fill into the voids of the starting 3D-ordered latex film, the subsequent hydrolysis and calcination led to the formation of 3D-ordered TiO2 or Fe2O3 film.21 In the present case, the sputtering species under the magnetron sputtering condition could not penetrate into the sublayer of the starting latex film, thus 2D-ordered AgO/TiO2 dome film was obtained. As shown in Fig. 1c, TEM image of the 2D-ordered AgO/TiO2 domes indicates that the average shell thickness of the domes is 6.8 nm. The dome shell is composed of nanoparticles with sizes of ∼3.9 nm (Fig. 1d), among which there are nano pores. 2D-ordered dome film of nano titania (2D-TiO2) was prepared by the same procedure as that of the 2D-Ag-TiO2 film except for using TiO2 disk as the RF magnetron sputtering target. It also exhibits a closely packed, hexagonal TiO2 dome array with diameter of 350.0 nm and height of 125 nm (Fig. 2a, b). The 2D-ordered TiO2 domes with an average shell thickness of 16.0 nm are composed of nanoparticles with sizes of ∼3.5 nm (Fig. 2c, d).

Fig. 3 shows XPS spectra of the 2D-Ag-TiO2 film and the 2D-TiO2 film. For the 2D-Ag-TiO2 film, Ag(3d5/2, 3d3/2) doublet was observed at binding energies of 367.15 and 373.5 eV (Fig. 3A). It has been reported that Ag3d5/2 binding energies of Ag, Ag2O and AgO are in the order: Ag (368.2 eV) > Ag2O (367.8 eV) > AgO (367.4 eV).22,23 Therefore, the binding energy (367.15 eV) of Ag3d5/2 in the 2D-Ag-TiO2 film is assigned to Ag2+.

The binding energies of Ti2p3/2 and Ti2p1/2 are 457.55 and 463.15 eV, respectively (Fig. 3B). As compared to the binding energy of Ti2p3/2 (458.70 eV) for Ti4+ of Degussa titania powder (TiO2(P25)), there is a red-shift of 1.15 eV for that of the 2D-Ag-TiO2 film. This result suggests that the 2D-Ag-TiO2 film is composed of Ti3+ ions.24,25 The 2D-TiO2 film exhibits an XPS spectrum of Ti2p3/2 and Ti2p1/2 almost the same as that of the 2D-Ag-TiO2 film, indicating that the 2D-TiO2 film is also composed of Ti3+ ions. The presence of Ti3+ ions in the 2D-TiO2 and 2D-Ag-TiO2 films suggests that oxygen vacancies are generated to maintain electrostatic balance in titania. The chemisorption of H2O molecule on the oxygen vacancies would lead to the formation of surface hydroxyl, which is confirmed by XPS spectrum of O1s. The 2D-Ag-TiO2 film exhibits an XPS spectrum of O1s similar to that of the 2D-TiO2 film, which features a large peak overlapping with a shoulder peak. The XPS spectra of O1s were fitted with the nonlinear least-squares fit program using Gauss-Lorentzian peak shapes. Two O1s peaks appear after deconvolution, which are attributed to lattice oxygen (529.24 eV) and surface hydroxyl oxygen (531.34 eV) in the 2D-Ag-TiO2 films, respectively (Fig. 3C).22,26 The binding energy of O1s (529.24 eV) is smaller than that of O1s (530.0 eV) of lattice oxygen in TiO2 (P25). This further confirms the existence of Ti3+ in the 2D-TiO2 and 2D-Ag-TiO2 films as the lattice oxygen bonded to Ti3+ has higher electron density than the lattice oxygen bonded to Ti4+ in TiO2. After deducting the contribution of oxygen in the surface hydroxyl oxygen, the atomic compositions of the 2D-Ag-TiO2 and 2D-TiO2 films, which are calculated by XPS, are TiO1.88 and Ti0.98Ag0.02O1.92, respectively.
The 2D-ordered dome film of nano Ag2+ doped titania is quite different from the reported TiO2-AgxO nanocomposites, which are easily photoreduced to metallic Ag nanoparticles.27,28 The 2D-Ag-TiO2 film shows excellent photostability. Even after the illumination of the 2D-Ag-TiO2 film under indoor fluorescent lamp for three months at ambient temperature, no detectable photoreduction of Ag2+ to metallic Ag is observed, which is evidenced by the XPS observation that the valence state (Ag2+) of silver in the 2D-Ag-TiO2 film remains unchanged (Fig. 3A, curve d).

Fig. 4 shows XRD patterns and DRUV-vis spectra of the 2D-ordered dome films. Both the 2D-Ag-TiO2 and 2D-TiO2 films are amorphous (Fig. 4A). The existence of oxygen vacancies or Ti3+ ions in the 2D-TiO2 film extend the absorption of TiO2 from UV region to visible region up to 530 nm due to a new electronic level within the band gap of TiO2 induced by the oxygen vacancies, which was concluded by first-principles band calculations (Fig. 4B).13 Doping of Ag2+ in the 2D-TiO2 film considerably enhance the visible light absorption of the 2D-Ag-TiO2 film. The enhanced visible absorption, which is not due to the surface plasma resonance of metallic Ag in Ag/TiO2 nanocomposites reported in a lot of literature,29–34 experimentally confirm the theoretical prediction by first-principles band calculations.35 Replacing lattice Ti atom in TiO2 by silver atom leads to the formation of new bands within the band gaps of TiO2. The new bands are explained mainly by the orbitals of Ag4d states mixed with Ti3d states, and are supposed to contribute to the visible light absorption.

Selective photocatalytic activity
The photodegradation of cationic dye such as crystal violet (CV) and anionic dye such as methyl orange (MO) on the 2D-Ag-TiO2 film is illustrated in Fig. 5A. CV is slowly photodegraded without photocatalyst under UV-Vis irradiation (Fig. 5A, curve a). Remarkably, the cationic CV is quickly photodegraded on the 2D-Ag-TiO2 film under UV-Vis irradiation with 73.2% of conversion within 120 min (Fig. 5A, curve b). In striking contrast, no photodegradation for the anionic MO is observed on the 2D-Ag-TiO2 film (Fig. 5A, curve c). The beneficial effect of Ag2+ doping in the 2D-Ag-TiO2 film on photocatalytic activity is quite apparent. The 2D-Ag-TiO2 film shows higher photocatalytic activity for the photodegradation of cationic CV than the pure 2D-TiO2 film with only 57.6% of CV conversion within 120 min (Fig. 5A, curve d). Interestingly, the 2D-TiO2 film also shows 100% photocatalytic selectivity for the cationic CV, and no photodegradation for the anionic MO is observed (Fig. 5A, curve e). This result reveals that the Ag2+ doping does not change the photocatalytic selectivity of the 2D-TiO2 film.

(B) The durability of the 2D-Ag-TiO2 film for the photodegradation of CV under UV-visible irradiation. 
The recycled experiments for the photodegradation of the cationic CV under UV-visible irradiation were performed to evaluate the photostability of the 2D-Ag-TiO2 film. As shown in Fig. 5B, its photocatalytic conversion increases from 73.2% to 93.9% at the initial eight cycles, each of which last two hours. After eight cycles, its photocatalytic activity remains unchanged. After the recycled experiments, the photodegradation of the anionic MO on the used 2D-Ag-TiO2 film is tested again. No photodegradation for the anionic dye was detected (Fig. 5A, curve f).
Furthermore, even after illuminated under indoor fluorescent lamp for three months at ambient temperature, the 2D-Ag-TiO2 film still shows highly selective photocatalytic activity. After the long time illumination, we tested the photocatalytic activity of the illuminated 2D-Ag-TiO2 film for the photodegradation of the cationic CV and anionic MO under the UV-visible irradiation. The illuminated 2D-Ag-TiO2 film still exhibits highly selective photodegradation of the cationic CV with 84.6% of conversion within 120 min like the fresh 2D-Ag-TiO2 film without detectable photodegradation for the anionic MO (Supporting information, Figure S1). These results reveal that the 2D-Ag-TiO2 film shows excellent selective photocatalytic durability and photostability.
Normally, the photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants on TiO2 proceeds according to the following widely accepted mechanism:1 Upon excitation by photons with energies equal to or higher than its band gap, electrons are excited from the valence band into the unoccupied conduction band, leading to excited electrons in the conduction band and positive holes in the valence band. The photogenerated electrons get trapped and react with O2 adsorbed on the surface of TiO2 to generate active oxygen species (e.g., O2−). The photogenerated holes react with hydroxyl groups to produce hydroxyl radicals (•OH). As the hydroxyl radicals are highly reactive, it is very difficult to achieve highly selective photodegradation or photo-oxidation of a selected pollutant or organic compound. This is confirmed by the photodegradation of the cationic CV and anionic MO under UV-vis irradiation on TiO2(P25), widely used as a benchmarking photocatalyst. Both cationic CV and anionic MO are photodegraded, and no selective photodegradation was observed (Figure S2). Although, very recently, tunable photocatalytic selectivity in decomposing anionic MO and cationic methyl blue(MB) was achieved by the surface modifications of TiO2 with fluoration and NaOH washing,6,7 so far, 100% selective photodegradation of a selected dye has not been reported on TiO2-based photocatalysts including Ag/TiO2 nanocomposites.29–34
Therefore, in principle, to achieve highly selective photocatalytic reaction, the high active hydroxyl radicals (•OH) should be avoided by designing a novel photocatalyst or controlling reaction conditions. In the present work, we successfully achieve 100% photocatalytic selectivity to the cationic CV by preparing the novel 2D-ordered dome films with abundant oxygen vacancies or Ti3+ ions, which change the above photocatalytic mechanism evidenced by the less detectable hydroxyl radicals (•OH) in the process of photocatalytic reaction (Figure S3). The 100% photocatalytic selectivity reveals that the dye photodegradation on the 2D-Ag-TiO2 and 2D-TiO2 films follows photosensitization mechanism:36,37 The dye, instead of the TiO2 photocatalyst, is excited by light irradiation. The excited dye molecule transfers electrons into the conduction band of TiO2, while the dye itself is converted to its cationic radical. The injected electrons react with O2 adsorbed on the surface of TiO2 to generate active oxygen species (e.g., O2−), which leads to the degradation of the dye and the cationic dye radical. According to this mechanism, the photocatalytic activity highly depends on the adsorption capacity of dye on the photocatalyst and the efficiency of the electron transfer from excited dye to the photocatalyst, which greatly influences the photocatalytic selectivity.
Adsorption of dye
By monitoring the concentration of the dyes in the bulk solution after the adsorption/desorption equilibrium was reached from various initial concentrations of different dyes, the adsorption isotherms of dyes on the 2D-Ag-TiO2 and 2D-TiO2 film were examined. The adsorption isotherms of the cationic CV show the typical Langmuir adsorption/desorption behaviors.37 The adsorption isotherm of CV on the 2D-Ag-TiO2 film is shown in Fig. 6 as an example. The good linear relationship (with a standard deviation R value of 0.9998 for the 2D-Ag-TiO2 systems) of the Langmuir isotherms (Ceq/Γ versus Ceq) suggests that CV tends to adsorb on the surface of the 2D-Ag-TiO2 film in monolayer and single-site modes.37 The saturation adsorption amount for the cationic CV on the 2D-Ag-TiO2 and 2D-TiO2 films is 0.14 μmol g−1 and 0.032 μmol g−1, respectively, while no adsorption of the anionic MO on both the 2D-Ag-TiO2 and 2D-TiO2 films is detected (Table 1). In contrast, TiO2 (P25) powder can adsorb both CV and MO without adsorption selectivity.38

Therefore, the 100% photocatalytic selectivity for the cationic CV on the 2D-Ag-TiO2 and 2D-TiO2 films is attributed to the high adsorption selectivity and the less detectable hydroxyl radicals in the process of the photocatalytic reaction, most probably due to the presence of oxygen vacancies or Ti3+ ions in the 2D-Ag-TiO2 and 2D-TiO2 films.
Sensing property

Fig. 7 presents the transient response of the photocurrent of the 2D-TiO2 and 2D-Ag-TiO2 films versus the concentration of CV under the visible irradiation (λ > 400 nm). The 2D-TiO2 film exhibits very good photocurrent response and recovery when the light was alternately turned on and switched off (Fig. 7A). Even in the absence of dye, the 2D-TiO2 film exhibits visible photocurrent response, further confirming the visible absorption induced by oxygen vacancies or Ti3+ ions as shown in Fig. 4B. The photocurrent of the 2D-TiO2 film significantly increases with increasing CV concentration, indicating that the CV adsorption on oxygen vacancies of the 2D-TiO2 film exhibits efficient electron transfer from excited dyes to the conduction band of TiO2. The sensitivity to dye is defined as Ip/Ia, where Ip and Ia are the photocurrents of the 2D-odered dome film in the presence and absence of the tested dye, respectively. As shown in Fig. 7C, there is a very good linear relationship between the sensitivity and the testing dye concentration. The sensitivity of the 2D-TiO2 film increases from 1.62 to 8.41 with the concentration of cationic CV changing from 1.14 × 10−6 mol L−1 to 2.86 × 10−5 mol L−1. In striking contrast, there is no photocurrent evolution with the concentration of the anionic MO changing from 1.14 × 10−6 mol L−1 to 2.86 × 10−5 mol L−1 (Figure S4). Its sensitivity remains unchanged with increasing MO concentration (Fig. 7C).

(C) Sensor selectivity of the 2D-Ag-TiO2 and the 2D-TiO2 films to cationic CV and anionic MO with the evolution of dye concentration. 
The beneficial effect of Ag2+ doping in the 2D-Ag-TiO2 film on its sensitivity is also quite apparent. At the same CV concentration, the photocurrent of the 2D-Ag-TiO2 film is much larger than that of the 2D-TiO2 film (Fig. 7B), indicating that the former exhibits much higher charge transfer efficiency from excited dyes to conduction band of titania than the latter. This is the reason why the 2D-Ag-TiO2 film exhibits higher photocatalytic activity than the 2D-TiO2 film. For the 2D-Ag-TiO2 film, there is also a very good linear relationship between the sensitivity and the testing dye concentration. As compared to the 2D-TiO2 film, the 2D-Ag-TiO2 film shows much enhanced sensitivity to the cationic CV. With the concentration of cationic CV changing from 1.14 × 10−6 mol L−1 to 2.86 × 10−5 mol L−1, the sensitivity of the 2D-Ag-TiO2 film increases from 1.72 to 31.7 while the sensitivity of the 2D-TiO2 film only increases from 1.62 to 8.41. These results suggest that the 2D-Ag-TiO2 and 2D-TiO2 films can be used as a highly selective ratiometric photoelectrochemical sensor for cationic CV.
To provide fundamental insight into the significant enhancement of charge transfer efficiency upon Ag2+ doping, the photocurrent decay kinetics after switching off light for the 2D-Ag-TiO2 and 2D-TiO2 films at the CV concentration of 28.6 μmol L−1 in Fig. 7 is analyzed as it can provide comprehensive information about the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes. The dynamic responses of the photocurrent decay for the 2D-TiO2 film after switching off light can be well described by a dual exponential dynamic model as follows: I = I0 + A1exp(−t/τ1) + A2exp(−t/τ2), where τ is the electron's lifetime.39,40 Two distinct lifetime components, τ1 and τ2 are shown in Table 2. The short component (τ1 = 0.21) is probably due to the back recombination of the photoexcited electrons at the conduction band of TiO2 with the cationic radicals produced by light excitation. The longer component (τ2 = 5.1) was probably attributed to the back recombination of the photoexcited electrons trapped in the oxygen vacancies in the 2D-TiO2 film with the cationic dye radicals.

In striking contrast, as compared to the 2D-TiO2 film, the photocurrent for the 2D-Ag-TiO2 film after switching off the light, decays much more slowly. The dynamic responses of the photocurrent decay for the 2D-Ag-TiO2 film can be well described by a triple exponential dynamic model as follows: I = I0 + A1exp(−t/τ1) + A2exp(−t/τ2) + A3exp(−t/τ3).39,40 A new longest lifetime component (τ3) appears, except for the shortest component and the medial component. According to the theoretical prediction by first-principles band calculations, new bands composed of Ag4d and Ti3d orbitals is formed between the valence band and conduction band of TiO2 in the Ag doped TiO2.35 Therefore, the new longest component (τ3 = 9.1 s) was probably attributed to the decay of electrons trapped by the new bands of Ag4d and Ti3d orbitals in the 2D-Ag-TiO2 film: The excitation of dye adsorbed on the 2D-Ag-TiO2 film leads to electron transfer from excited dye to the conduction band of TiO2, then transfers to the new bands of Ag4d and Ti3d orbitals. This electron transfer avoids the back recombination of the photogenerated electrons in the conduction band of TiO2 with the excited dyes, thus significantly improving the charge transfer efficiency in the 2D-Ag-TiO2 film as compared to the pure 2D-TiO2 film.
Conclusions
In summary, we synthesized novel 2D-ordered dome films of nano titania and nano Ag2+ doped titania. The existence of abundant oxygen vacancies or Ti3+ ions in the 2D-ordered dome films extends the absorption of TiO2 from UV region to visible region up to 530 nm due to a new electronic level within the band gap of TiO2 induced by the oxygen vacancies. Doping of Ag2+ in the 2D-TiO2 film considerably enhance the visible light absorption of the 2D-Ag-TiO2 film as it induces new bands between the valence band and conduction band of TiO2. Remarkably, for the cationic CV and anionic MO, the 2D-ordered dome films exhibit 100% photodegradation selectivity to the cationic CV with excellent selective photocatalytic durability and photostability, and unique ratiometric photoelectrochemical sensing property with 100% selectivity to the cationic CV. The 100% photocatalytic and sensing selectivity for the cationic CV is attributed to the high adsorption selectivity and the less detectable hydroxyl radicals in the process of the photocatalytic reaction, most probably due to the presence of oxygen vacancies or Ti3+ ions in the 2D-Ag-TiO2 and 2D-TiO2 films. Ag2+ doping in the 2D-TiO2 film significantly improves the photocatalytic activity and photoelectrochemical sensitivity as it considerably enhances the charge transfer efficiency from excited dye to titania. The present study may open new opportunity for selective photocatalysis and photoelectrochemical sensor with high selectivity.
