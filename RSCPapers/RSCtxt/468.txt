        Benzimidazolyl functionalized ionic liquids were synthesized and applied as additives for dye-sensitized solar cells. The fabricated devices show an overall power conversion efficiency of ∼7.79% under AM 1.5 radiation (50 mW cm−2), and an excellent long-term stability.

Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are photoelectrochemical solar cells that contain an electrolyte, which have recently gained considerable academic and industrial interest because of their high photoelectric conversion efficiency, simple assembly technology, and low manufacturing cost.1–3 Although photoelectric conversion efficiency up to 12% has been achieved, there are still some scientific and technological difficulties that should be overcome before the practical outdoor use of DSSCs.3 It has been recently demonstrated that significant improvement in photovoltaic parameters of DSSCs could be achieved by the addition of certain compounds to the solar cell electrolyte.4 Additives including 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP),5N-methylbenzimidazole (NMBI),6 and N-butylbenzimidazole (NBB)7 have been extensively studied. These additives generally give a significant improvement of open-circuit photovoltage (Voc), higher fill factor (FF) and solar energy conversion efficiency (η), while the short-circuit current (Jsc) is not much affected or slightly decreased.5 The additives could decrease the rate constants of triiodine reduction to suppress the dark current at the TiO2/electrolyte interfaces,5,8 increase the electron lifetime,9 and decrease the conduction band of TiO2, resulting in an increase of Voc at a fixed photoinduced charge density.10 More recently, other alkylpyridines and nitrogen-heterocyclic compounds have been applied as additives which improve the performance of these solar cells.4,11 However, most of the additives studied are common organic compounds with relatively low boiling points, resulting in device degradation due to escape of volatile components in practical use.8,12
Ionic liquids are organic salts with melting points at or near room temperature. Ionic liquids have been extensively studied as alternative electrolytes for DSSCs because of their nonvolatility, high stability, high ion conductivity and wide electrochemical activity.7 However, ionic liquid based DSSCs with a volatile additive could still cause the degradation issues resulting from loss of additive in long time use. Based on our best knowledge, there is no report that ionic liquids act as an additive to improve the performance of DSSCs. Herein we report novel benzimidazolyl functionalized ionic liquid additives. These compounds with low volatility not only enhance the Voc but also improve the Jsc values, resulting in the high overall solar conversion efficiencies and long-term stability of the DSSCs.

Fig. 1 shows the chemical structure and thermal properties of the additives TBP, NBB, and ionic liquid additives 3-(4-(benzimidazolyl)butyl)-1-methylimidazolium bromide ([BMImB]Br) and 3-(4-(benzimidazolyl)butyl)-1-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate ([BMImB]BF4). The purity and chemical structure of the synthesized ionic liquid additives were confirmed by NMR measurements. Both additives show decomposition temperature higher than 300 °C (Fig. S1, ESI†), indicating that benzimidazolyl functionalized ionic liquid additives indeed offer a high thermal stability, far beyond the range of interest for the application in DSSCs.
 Fig. 1  Molecular structure and thermal properties (boiling point, bp, and decomposition temperature, Td) of the additives developed in this work. 
The photovoltaic parameters of DSSCs containing volatile liquid electrolytes (Cells A and B), and with ionic liquid electrolytes (Cells C, D, E and F), respectively, are summarized in Table 1. It can be clearly seen that Cell B based on the volatile liquid electrolyte, containing [BMImB]Br as an additive, shows better cell performance than Cell A with TBP (Fig. 2a). All the photovoltaic parameters of Cell B have been greatly improved compared with those of Cell A. Among the cells containing the ionic liquid electrolytes, Cells E and F show higher DSSC performances than Cells C and D that contain additives of NBB and TBP, respectively. In addition, compound [BMImB]Br shows a highest Jsc value of 15.17 mA cm−2 and a η of 6.50% in DSSCs (Fig. 2b). These results reveal that the addition of ionic liquid additives could improve the performance of DSSCs.

 Fig. 2  
J–V characteristics of DSSCs containing: (a) volatile liquid electrolyte Cells A and B, (b) ionic liquid electrolyte Cells C, D, E and F. The J–V curves were measured under simulated AM 1.5 solar spectrum irradiation at 100 mW cm−2. 
The additives in the DSSCs reduce the dark current level, as shown in Fig. S2 (see ESI†). The lower dark current yields higher Voc. It has been hypothesized that the additive compounds anchor on the free areas of the dye-coated TiO2 electrode and suppress the dark current originating from the reduction of triiodine (I3−) by conduction band electrons from the interface of the electrolyte and TiO2 electrode.5,11 The decrease of the I3−reduction rate leads to increase in Voc.5 The cells containing ionic liquid additives show higher Voc. New additives have relatively larger methylimidazolium tail groups, which leads to the tail being far away from the photoelectrode, resulting in a negligible effect on conduction band shifting of TiO2 due to long adjacent distance. The enhancement of Voc could be ascribed to an alternative cause. It has been reported that iodine could form anion complexes with some anions, such as I2Br−, I2SCN−,13 and their analogues. Moreover, the imidazolium rings can interact strongly with I2Br− or I2BF4− because the bigger anions have a lower charge density.14 Therefore, these anion complexes reduce the recombination between the injected electrons and I3−, thus enhancing the Voc and Jsc values of cells.13Fig. 3 shows the Raman spectra of the mixtures containing iodine and NBB, TBP, [BMImB]Br and [BMImB]BF4, respectively. The peak intensity ratio of 209 and 191 cm−1 indicates the interaction between iodine and anion.15 A lower intensity ratio implies a stronger interaction. Here, the intensity ratio for I2NBB−, I2TBP−, I2Br− and I2BF4− is 4.73, 4.47, 4.12 and 3.99, respectively, indicating that [BMImB]Br is the most effective additive for the performance enhancement.

Fig. 4 illustrates the electrochemical behavior of the cells constructed with the two-electrode mode. The exchange current density (jo) reflects intrinsic rates of electron transfer between the electrolyte and electrode.16,17 The smaller the jo, the lesser the electron transfer resistance that occurs at the TiO2 photoelectrode/electrolyte interface.8 The jo of [BMImB]Br (Cell B) is lower than that for TBP (Cell A). In the case of [BMImB]Br and [BMImB]BF4 in ionic liquid electrolyte-based cells, the jo values are lower than those for NBB (Cell C) and TBP (Cell D). All the cells containing ionic liquid additives show a broad peak, and the potential at the intersection of the anodic and cathodic branches of the polarization curves shifts negatively because ionic liquid additives effectively reduce the interfacial exchange current density, restraining the dark reaction of the I3− ions interacting with the photoelectrodes.8

The exchange current density (jo) is evaluated from the intersection of the linear anodic and cathodic branches of the polarization curves as Tafel plots. The scanning rate is 0.2 mV s−1. 
Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were further used to investigate the interfacial charge transfer processes of the DSSCs (Fig. S3, see ESI†), measured at −0.70 V in the dark, and the resistance values are listed in Table S1 (see ESI†). R1, R2, and R3 represent charge-transfer resistance at the counter electrode, the resistance of TiO2/FTO, TiO2/electrolyte interface, and the Nernst diffusion in the electrolyte, respectively.18–21 Compared with NBB- and TBP-based cells, ionic liquid additives increase the resistance of the TiO2/electrolyte interface (R2) that could effectively reduce the dark current.
Fig. S4 shows the IPCE values of the devices containing volatile liquid and ionic liquid electrolytes, respectively (see ESI†). The broad feature appears to cover the visible spectrum range from 450 to 650 nm. The maximum IPCE values at 520 nm are 69%, 78%, 74%, 73%, 79% and 75% for the Cells A, B, C, D, E and F, respectively. Using a solar photon flux of the standard AM 1.5 spectrum, a simple multiplication with the external quantum efficiency spectrum and the elementary charge will lead to a calculated Jsc. The calculated Jsc values are consistent with the measured Jsc. Table 2 shows the superior device performances obtained under both high and low simulated sunlight irradiations. A highest η value of 7.79% is obtained for the Cell E with [BMImB]Br as an additive.

Fig. S5 presents the time dependence of photovoltaic data of ionic liquid electrolyte-based DSSCs containing NBB, TBP, [BMImB]Br and [BMImB]BF4 under indoor light at room temperature. The cell retained almost 97% of its initial conversion efficiency over this period, indicating the excellent stability of [BMImB]Br-based DSSCs. Similarly, the device fabricated with [BMImB]BF4 maintained 89% of its initial value. The cells containing NBB retained 81% of the initial performance over 50 days. In the case of the TBP, a compound with relative lower boiling point and higher volatilization showed the poorest cell stability (71% of the initial value). The high stability of ionic liquid additives might be due to the non-volatility of additives or might as well be simply due to the high viscosity of ionic liquid additives. Here, the intrinsic viscosity of the additives was measured to be 825, 12.5, 23785 and 22760 cP at 25 °C for NBB, TBP, [BMImB]Br and [BMImB]BF4, respectively. High viscosity of the additives increases the viscosity of electrolytes and may increase the stability of DSSCs.
In conclusion, nonvolatile benzimidazolyl functionalized ionic liquid additives have been synthesized to achieve high performance DSSCs. These novel ionic liquid additives could enhance the photovoltaic performance including solar power conversion and device stability. The efficiency enhancement is ascribed to suppression of charge recombination at the interfacial layer. The superior stability is ascribed to the nonvolatility and high viscosity of the electrolytes. We expect that these ionic liquid additives may be applied to most DSSCs to achieve high performance and enhanced stability.
