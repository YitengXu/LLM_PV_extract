    , Accepted 31st August 2022First published on 15th September 2022AbstractMetal halide perovskite materials exhibit remarkable optoelectronic properties due to their unique crystal and electronic structures. In perovskite polycrystalline films, the carrier transport is easily affected by grain boundaries where the defect density and stress are concentrated. Lacking grain boundaries, single crystals exhibit lower defect density, higher carrier mobility and longer carrier lifetime, thus benefiting longer carrier diffusion length. However, the large thickness of single crystals is not conducive to direct extraction of carriers out of photoelectric devices because the carrier diffusion length is within dozens of micrometers. Therefore, ultrathin single crystal films (SCFs) are demanded for photoelectric devices. In this paper, we put forward an improved space confined method, in which the nucleation and growth processes are controlled through altering the heating area. A series of MAPbBr3 SCFs with maximum size over 30 mm and controllable thickness (15–45 μm) are obtained. The growth kinetics of MAPbBr3 SCFs are analyzed in detail. Owing to the controllable growth kinetics, MAPbBr3 SCFs possess higher crystallinity, higher photo-induced carrier densities and longer carrier lifetimes than the corresponding bulk single crystals (BSCs). Therefore, MAPbBr3 SCFs exhibit better optoelectronic performance and device stability as planar photo-detectors, such as lower dark currents and higher photo-currents, higher R and EQE values and higher on/off ratios.
1. Introduction
Metal halide perovskite materials exhibit excellent photoelectric properties due to their unique crystal and electronic structures, such as high optical absorption coefficient, adjustable band gap width, low exciton binding energy, high carrier mobility, long diffusion length, electron and hole bipolar transmission and so on.1,2 Such unique characteristics boost their applications in the fields of solar cells,3–9 photo-detectors,10–19 light emitting diodes,20,21 lasers22,23 and field effect transistors,24 especially using polycrystalline thin films and nanocrystals. In perovskite polycrystalline materials, the high density grain boundaries lead to high trap states, which are related to non-radiative recombination and affect the charge carrier lifetime, resulting in poor device performance. Because of lacking grain boundaries, single crystals have lower defect density,25 higher carrier mobility,26 and longer carrier lifetime.27 These advantages make single crystals exhibit longer carrier diffusion length.28–30 In addition, the stability of perovskite crystal materials is also of great concern. The existence of massive amorphous or low crystallinity grain boundaries in polycrystalline materials leads to low decomposition temperature and high-speed ion migration paths, which reduces the crystal stability.31
However, in bulk single crystals (BSCs), the large thickness of BSCs is not conducive to direct extraction of carriers out of photoelectric devices because charge recombination increases as the thickness increases.32 Therefore, preparation of single crystal films (SCFs) is highly desirable and intriguing to boost device performance in the field. Till now, the certified power conversion efficiency of perovskite polycrystalline thin film solar cells (25.5%)33 has been higher than that of perovskite SCF solar cells (22.8%).5 Thus, developing SCF solar cells with potentially high efficiency and stability evoke more and more attention. Besides optimizing chemical compositions, designing reasonable solar cell structures, and regulating interface engineering, how to obtain large size and high quality SCFs is the most critical factor that restricts the realization of superior efficiency SCF solar cells. Furthermore, the large size SCF is favorable for the preparation of integrated optoelectronic devices.34 The larger light receiving area is beneficial to achieving better optoelectronic performance. Currently, the methods of growing large perovskite BSCs are almost mature, such as aqueous solution cooling,25 anti-solvent,28 inverse temperature growth35 and solvent volatilization methods.36 Development of single crystal growth techniques provides methodological guidance for growth of SCFs. For example, using ultrasonic-promoted nucleation, wire cutting, surface tension-induced dominant nucleation and chemical vapor deposition growth SCFs can be obtained.37–40 In addition, the general growth method for ultrathin perovskite SCFs has also been developed.41 However, the growth of large-scale SCFs is still challenging because of the similar growth rates of perovskites with three-dimensional crystal structures. Therefore, to obtain SCFs, confining one of the growth directions, namely, the space-confined growth method, is proposed.34,42 Based on the confined space method, a large area (6 × 8 mm) MAPbBr3 SCF is obtained.43 As we know it, rationally controlling the nucleation density and macroscopic growth kinetics is crucial for obtaining large size SCFs during space-confined growth. The flow velocity of the mother solution, the hydrophobicity of the substrates44 and the gaps between the substrates greatly affect the nucleation and growth kinetics of MAPbI3 SCFs. Among them, MAPbBr3 SCFs evoke more attentions than other perovskites because of low crystallization energy, and easily to grow ultrathin films and excellent optoelectronic properties.32,45 However growing large size MAPbBr3 SCFs over 30 mm still has challenges because the growth kinetics of MAPbBr3 SCFs is still unknown. In a word, investigation about MAPbBr3 SCFs lags behind compared to polycrystalline films and BSCs.
In this study, we proposed a novel method, namely, the altering heating area assisted space-confined method, to control the nucleation and growth kinetics of MAPbBr3 SCFs. Large size and high crystallinity MAPbBr3 SCFs (within 50 μm), with a smooth surface, low trap density and high carrier mobility, can be easily obtained. The photo-electronic performances were superior to those of bulk single crystals through comparing planar photo-detectors.
2. Results and discussion
Fig. S1a (ESI†) shows the picture of MAPbBr3 SCFs obtained by the traditional space-confined method at 80 °C within dozens of micrometer confined space constructed using two glass sheets with a side length of 20 mm. The DMF solvent preferentially volatilizes at the edge of the confined space at 80 °C, leading to tiny wafers crystallized at the edge, which further blocks solvent volatilization. In order to reduce the volatilization rate of DMF compared with that at a fixed temperature of 80 °C, the growth temperature was firstly set at 40 °C and then slowly increased from 40 °C to 80 °C, as shown in Fig. S1b (ESI†); small wafers appeared in the confined space, but small wafers were not completely avoided to appear at the edge, which indicated that it was difficult to obtain large-scale SCFs through solvent volatilization. To control the volatilization rate of DMF and the growth rate of the wafers, the confined space device was placed in a sealed container with saturated DMF vapor (Fig. S1c, ESI†). The concentration of the solution at the edge of the growth device is diluted by DMF vapor and thus crystallization cannot happen. Small wafers appear within the confined space whose size can exceed 2 mm (Fig. S1(d and e), ESI†). Within the confined space, the radius of curvature of the solution in such a capillary is reduced, resulting in an increase in the saturation vapor pressure and the solution is more vaporizable. Thus, a large number of small crystals appear at the edges. The saturated solvent vapor-assisted method can reduce the volatilization of the solution at the edge through environmental solvent vapor, which is beneficial to obtaining a larger area of SCFs. Fig. S1f (ESI†) shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the MAPbBr3 SCF and powders. The exposed crystal plane of the MAPbBr3 SCF is indexed as the {100} family.
Although the vapor-assisted method helps to eliminate nucleation occurring at the edge of the confined space when growing in a static solution, once the wafer grows to a certain size, the MAPbBr3 solute was fully consumed and could not provide sufficient MAPbBr3 for continuous growth of the wafer. Thus, we adopt the strategy of continuously feeding MAPbBr3 during the wafer growth,43 as shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). The continuous feeding impels a large number of nuclei simultaneously, and the size of wafers can reach over 3–10 mm after growing for 15 h. The XRD patterns of the MAPbBr3 SCF and powders in Fig. S2e (ESI†) show that the exposed crystal plane of the SCF is indexed as the {100} family.
After many attempts, it is found that controlling the nucleus quantity under continuous feeding is crucial for growing large-sized MAPbBr3 wafers. Accurately feeding the MAPbBr3 solute towards the wafers is critical. Therefore, we propose a novel strategy, namely the altering heating area assisted confined space method, as shown in Fig. 1a. At the nucleation stage under continuous feeding at 110 °C, MAPbBr3 nucleation occurs within the small heated area, and no nucleation occurs beyond the unheated area because of inverse temperature solubility. Using a smaller heating area, the nucleation temperature should increase (8 mm heating vs. 130 °C). So the number of nuclei is strictly controlled, which is conducive to the subsequent acquisition of large-size wafers. When a single nucleus is formed (a visible tiny small wafer), the heating source is lowered in temperature to 100 °C, where MAPbBr3 preferentially grows onto the small wafers and the wafers are able to grow larger without the appearance of new nuclei. When the SCF length exceeds 5 mm, the heat source with a larger area is replaced and the temperature of the heat source is reduced by about 5 °C. With the continuous increase of the altering heating area, large size MAPbBr3 SCFs can be obtained. The initial nucleation of the tiny heating area can more conveniently control the growth position of the wafer and finally realize the in situ growth of the wafer. Fig. 1(b and c) displays an example of the growth process in which large size MAPbBr3 SCFs are obtained through the altering heating area assisted confined space method. Fig. S3a (ESI†) shows the other glimpse growing pictures, and the final area and depth of the MAPbBr3 SCF are ∼4.6 cm2 and 17.12 μm (Fig. S3b and the video in the ESI†).

It should be noted that one side of the SCF is regular and the opposite side is irregular, which is ascribed to the feeding direction, as shown in Fig. 1c. When contacting fresh saturated solution, the side of the SCF (labeled A) is fed with sufficient MAPbBr3, and therefore it displays a uniform growth rate. The concentration of solution around the B side depends on the turbulent flow that is blocked by the size of the SCF. The larger size of the wafer causes a more obvious turbulence flow effect and results in a more obvious growth velocity difference on the B side. Neglecting the regularity, large size SCFs can be easily obtained using our altering heating area assisted confined space method, as shown in Fig. 2a.

To obtain the growth kinetics of the MAPbBr3 SCF, the area of the SCF was accurately measured. Fig. 2(b and c) shows the time dependent growth kinetic curves of the MAPbBr3 SCF within 800 min. The growth kinetics are divided into three stages in terms of the growth rate. At the initial stage, the area of stable nuclei formed is extremely small, so the wafer growth rate is quite low. After the wafer size increases, the crystal growth rate also increases gradually, exceeding the initial stage by an order of magnitude. When the heating area is 40 mm, the growth rate reaches 2.47 × 10−3 cm2 min−1. The surface morphology of the MAPbBr3 SCF was further characterized through AFM, as shown in Fig. 2(d and e). Growth steps with heights of about 2.4–3.0 nm are reserved on the top surface, suggest 4–5 elemental growth steps (corresponded with one unit cell) bunched together.46 Despite the reserved steps, the fluctuation of the surface within 3 nm confirms the flat surfaces of the as-grown MAPbBr3 SCFs.
The transfer of large size MAPbBr3 SCFs out of the confined space is an obstacle. Aiding with the lubrication of DMC, exfoliation of MAPbBr3 SCFs is achieved. Fig. 3a illustrates some exfoliations from the large size MAPbBr3 SCFs, with a size of about 8 mm. The homogeneous transparent MAPbBr3 SCFs suggest their uniform thickness. Fig. 3b shows the XRD patterns of the MAPbBr3 SCF, BSC and the powders, which confirms that MAPbBr3 belongs to the cubic system (Pmm) and is in good agreement with the simulation results. Only the (100), (200), and (300) crystal planes are detected in the MAPbBr3 SCF and BSC, which both belong to the {100} crystal plane family, showing that the single crystal film has a high orientation. The comparison of crystalline perfection of the MAPbBr3 SCF and BSC is shown in Fig. 3c through the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the (200) plane. The narrower FWHM of the SCF implies more excellent crystallinity. The diffraction towards a smaller angle of the MAPbBr3 SCF suggests slight lattice expansion compared to the BSC, which is ascribed to the ultra-thin thickness and lattice relaxation. Fig. 3d displays a series of SEM images with various thicknesses of MAPbBr3 SCFs within 15–45 μm which is controlled via the thickness of the confined space. The sharp edges with straight lines suggest their rigid uniform thickness without macroscopic roughness. The surface and elemental distributions of the MAPbBr3 SCFs are shown in Fig. 3(e and f) and Fig. S4 (ESI†). The smooth surfaces and homogenous elemental distributions testify the uniform thickness and crystallites.

Fig. 4a shows the UV-vis absorption spectra of the SCF and BSC. Both the SCF and BSC have steep absorption onsets at 564 and 574 nm, respectively. The direct band gaps can be calculated from the UV-vis absorption spectra according to the Tauc equation: (αhv)2 = A(hv − Eg),47 where α represents the absorption coefficient, h is Planck's constant, v is the frequency, and Eg represents the band gap width. As shown in Fig. 4b, the band gaps of the SCF and BSC are 2.23 and 2.19 eV. The band gap of the SCF is between those of BSCs and polycrystalline films.35,43,45,48 Comparing with the BSC, the absorption onset of the MAPbBr3 SCF is steeper, suggesting its smaller Urbach tail and energy,49 which reflects the lower density of sub-bandgap states near the band edge for the MAPbBr3 SCF. Fig. 4(c and d) shows the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the MAPbBr3 SCF and BSC through 485 nm excitation, respectively. The PL intensity of the SCF is greatly increased than that of the BSC, suggesting a higher photo-excited electron–hole concentration and a lower non-radiative recombination energy loss in the MAPbBr3 SCF. The PL peak of the SCF is located around 537 nm, a slight red-shift compared with the BSC (531 nm), which is ascribed to photon cycles in which photons are reabsorbed and reemitted in the SCF.50,51 The carrier recombination dynamics was measured using a time correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) system, as shown in Fig. 4e. The decay of lifetime τ1 corresponds to surface defect related recombination and the decay of lifetime τ2 is radiative recombination. As shown in Table S1 (ESI†), the longer radiative recombination related τ2 and average lifetime of the SCF (37.4 and 21.0 ns) are higher than those of the BSC (10.6 and 7.7 ns), which is beneficial for longer carrier diffusion length. Besides, the percentages of τ1 and τ2 of SCF and BSC are listed in Table S1 (ESI†) as well. The slightly longer surface defect related non-radiative recombination τ1 of the SCF is attributed to the stepped surface of the SCF. The electronic structure of MAPbBr3 SCFs is revealed through ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS, hv = 21.22 eV for He I) in Fig. 4f and Fig. S5 (ESI†). The secondary electron cutoff energy (ESECO) obtained by the intersection point of the tangent to the curve at a higher binding energy can be used to calculate the Femi level (EF = −4.89 eV).12 In addition, the valence band maximum (VBM) and the conduction band minimum (CBM) of the MAPbBr3 SCF are −4.41 eV and −6.64 eV, respectively. It can be seen that the positions of the VBM and CBM of the MAPbBr3 SCF are slightly different from those of the BSC because of lattice relaxation of the ultra-thin films.52

To reveal the defect density and carrier mobility, sandwich structure devices were prepared by evaporating 50 nm thick gold electrodes on the two sides of the MAPbBr3 SCF and BSC for space charge limited current (SCLC) measurements,53 as shown in Fig. 5a. The thicknesses of the SCF and BSC are 43.98 μm and 950 μm. Fig. 5(b and c) shows the current–voltage (I–V) curves of the sandwich structure devices under dark conditions. The Ohmic contact characteristic, trap-filled, and Child regions appear in the I–V curves as the bias increases. The trap density (ntraps) and carrier mobility (μh) can be obtained using the following formulas:  and , where εr = 25.5 is the relative dielectric constant of MAPbBr3,35ε0 is the vacuum permittivity, e is the elementary charge, d is the thickness of the wafer, and J is the current density. The calculated ntraps of the SCF is ∼1.3 × 1011 cm−3, which is much less than the trap density of polycrystalline films.45 The calculated trap density of the BSC is ∼1.24 × 1010 cm−3, in the same order of magnitude as those of others.35 The higher ntraps of the SCF than that of the BSC can be ascribed to two reasons: one is eliminating surface defects on the BSC through fine polishing, whereas the polishing operation is difficult on the SCF surface. Another reason is attributed to the system measuring error of the SCLC measurement, and the ntraps is quite dependent on the depth of the crystals. Besides, the calculated μh of the SCF is ∼121 cm2 V−1 s−1 and the μh of the BSC is ∼73.4 cm2 V−1 s−1. The higher carrier mobility of the SCF is more helpful for long carrier diffusion distance and suitable for optoelectronic devices.

The photoelectric properties of MAPbBr3 SCFs were characterized using planar photo-detectors. The 50 nm depth interdigitated Au electrodes were evaporated on the (100) plane, as shown in Fig. 6a. The dark current is crucial for evaluating photo-detectors. Fig. S6 (ESI†) compares the dark currents of MAPbBr3 SCF and BSC photo-detectors. The dark current of the MAPbBr3 SCF is about an order of magnitude lower than that of the BSC. For instance, the dark currents are 0.028 μA and 0.115 μA for the MAPbBr3 SCF and BSC at 2.5 V bias, respectively. The lower dark current suggests its lower point defects in the MAPbBr3 SCF and beneficial for obtaining high photoresponse photo-detectors. Besides, the photo-currents obtained under various power densities using 405 nm illumination as shown in Fig. 6(b and c) prove that the photo-current of the MAPbBr3 SCF photo-detector is an order of magnitude higher than that of the BSC device under the same measurement conditions, suggesting that the SCF exhibits stronger charge transport ability. The photocurrent of the MAPbBr3 SCF photo-detector is ∼3.12 μA under an illumination power density of 0.637 mW cm−2 and 2.5 V bias, which is much higher than the photocurrent (∼0.96 μA) of the BSC photo-detector.

To quantitatively calculate the performance of the photo-detectors, responsivity (R) and external quantum efficiency (EQE) were calculated as follows:  and , where Ip and Id stand for the photocurrent and dark current, Pin is the 405 nm laser power density, S is the effective area of the photo-detector, h represents Planck's constant, c represents the speed of light in vacuum, λ represents the wavelength of incident light, and e is the charge of e element.54Fig. 6(d and e) shows the responsivities and EQEs of MAPbBr3 SCF and BSC photo-detectors under various power densities. The highest R and EQE values of the MAPbBr3 SCF photo-detector under a power density of 0.127 mW cm−2 and 2.5 V bias are 0.042 A W−1 and 12.88%, much larger than the R (0.015 A W−1) and EQE (4.47%) values of the MAPbBr3 BSC photo-detector, implying its high ratio of electron quantity vs. photon quantity.

Fig. 6(f and g) shows the continuous on/off cycles to reflect the switching characteristics of MAPbBr3 SCF and BSC photo-detectors at different applied voltages. When the illumination is on, the dark current of the SCF photo-detector is almost unchanged under different bias voltages, while the dark current of the BSC photo-detector shows an increasing trend, showing lower charged defects in the SCF. Fig. 6(h and i) shows the photo-current decay of the SCF and BSC photo-detectors after the illumination is turned on. When the laser is turned on, the electrons in the crystal are excited and the electron–hole pairs separate, instantaneously generating a large photo-current. Subsequently, due to the balance between the photogenerated carrier generation rate and diffusion rate, the photo-current gradually decays and finally reaches a relatively stable stage.55 In addition, electron–hole recombination occurs during the carrier migration process, which consumes part of the photogenerated carriers and eventually leads to the decay of the photocurrent as well. Under 0.637 mW cm−2 and 1.5 V bias, the photo-current decay of the SCF photo-detector is about 26.9%, while that of the BSC photo-detector is about 30.6%. The photo-current decay of the SCF photo-detector is smaller than that of the BSC photo-detector, implying its more favorable carrier separation in the SCF. At 0.637 mW cm−2 and bias voltages of 1 V and 1.5 V, the on/off ratios of the SCF photo-detector are about 107 and 135, respectively. For the BSC photo-detector, the on/off ratios are about 15 and 17, respectively, under the same conditions. The similar current values of the continuous cycles for the SCF photo-detector reveal a weak built-in potential induced by charged vacancies and ions, and excellent stability.
3. Experimental methods
3.1 Experimental materials
Lead bromide (PbBr2, ≥98%), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, ≥99%), methylamine aqueous solution (CH5N·H2O, analytical grade), hydrobromic acid (HBr, ≥47%), and dimethyl carbonate (DMC, ≥99%) were purchased from Aladdin without any further purification. CH3NH3Br (MABr) was synthesized according our previous report,46 as shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†).
3.2 Growth of MAPbBr3 SCFs and BSCs
We tried several methods to grow MAPbBr3 SCFs. The detailed growth processes with saturated solvent vapor assisted methods and the growth of BSCs are described in the ESI.†
The alterable heat area growth process was as follows: two 60 × 60 mm quartz glass sheets were successively cleaned with deionized water, ethanol and isopropyl alcohol by ultrasonic treatment. Then the glass sheets were dried at 60 °C and then conglutinated with an adhesive. The depth of confined spaces was controlled by adding weights on the upper quartz glass sheet. Two holes were designed along the diagonal of the upper quartz glass sheet for feeding and extracting mother solutions (1 M with equal molar amounts of MABr and PbBr2 in DMF). The feeding flow rate of the solution was maintained at 0.007 μL min−1. The confined space device was firstly heated to 110 °C using a small heat area to guarantee that the nucleation occurred at the heating part. After a small MAPbBr3 wafer was observed under an optical microscope, the growth temperature decreased to 100 °C to avoid spontaneous nucleation and reduce the growth rate of the SCFs. When the side length of the SCFs was over 5 mm, replacing a larger heating source with a diameter of 40 mm. After completion of the growth of MAPbBr3 SCFs, the mother solution was replaced by DMC to rinse the residual solution for several minutes.
3.3 Device fabrication
The sandwich structure devices were obtained by evaporating 50 nm thick gold electrodes on the two sides of the SCF and BSC. Planar metal–semiconductor–metal (MSM) photo-detectors (3 × 3 mm2) with interdigitated Au electrodes (width of 150 μm) were fabricated on the surface of MAPbBr3 SCFs and the polished (100) plane of BSCs. The interdigitated Au electrodes were prepared by thermal evaporation (VZZ-300, Vnano).
3.4 Characterizations
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the powders and planes were obtained on a powder X-ray diffractometer (Bruker D8 Advance). The surface structures of the MAPbBr3 SCF were observed in a tapped mode on an atomic force microscope (AFM, Veeco Dimension Icon). The surface morphologies and thickness of MAPbBr3 SCFs were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, S-4800, NOVA NanoSEM 450). The size and surface morphologies of the SCF were observed by optical microscopy (OM). The UV-Vis absorption spectra of the MAPbBr3 SCF and BSC were recorded on a METASH UV-8000 spectrometer. The valence band spectrum of the MAPbBr3 SCF was obtained by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) on a Kratos AXIS Supra X-ray photoelectron spectrometer with He I irradiation (photon energy = 21.22 eV). A HORIBA Fluorolog-3 spectrofluorometer equipped with a time correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) system was used to obtain the photoluminescence (PL) and carrier lifetimes. The optoelectronic properties of the MAPbBr3 SCF and BSC photo-detectors were characterized using an electrical characterization system (Keithley 2450). Under the illumination of a 405 nm InGaN-based semiconductor diode, the photo-currents of MaPbBr3 SCF and BSC photo-detectors were obtained.
4. Conclusions
In summary, MAPbBr3 SCFs with size over 30 mm with controllable thickness (15–45 μm) were grown through altering the area of the heat source. The macroscopic growth kinetics were revealed, which was helpful to the growth of large size SCFs. The high crystal quality and smooth surface are conducive to higher photocurrent-induced carrier density, longer carrier lifetime and higher carrier mobility compared to the MAPbBr3 BSC. Taking advantage of planar photo-detectors, the MAPbBr3 SCF photo-detectors have smaller dark currents and larger photo-currents, higher R and EQE values, higher on/off ratios and better stability. It is expected that our novel growth method can promote the growth of perovskite SCFs.
