    , Accepted 4th June 2018First published on 5th June 2018AbstractRare earth (RE3+)-doped NaY(MoO4)2 nanocrystals are efficient materials for realizing multicolor emission, which plays an important role in displays, W-LEDs, solar cells and biolabeling. Up to now, research on the multicolor tuning properties of RE3+-doped NaY(MoO4)2 nanoparticles has mostly focused on traditional preparation routes such as the hydrothermal method and sol–gel process. However, the products obtained using these methods are usually large in size (on the micron/submicron scale) and agglomeration problems are inevitable. With the development of nano optoelectronic devices and bioluminescence labeling, there is an urgent need to find an efficient method to prepare nanoscale, monodispersed and NaY(MoO4)2:RE3+ nanocrystals (NCs) with good crystallinity and stronger emission properties. In this work, we demonstrate a simple, fast, reproducible and one-step synthesis of NaY(MoO4)2:Eu3+ NCs with sizes varying from 1–20 nm via a ligand-assisted reprecipitation strategy. The reaction mechanism and emission intensities of NaY(MoO4)2:Eu3+ NCs with various morphologies have been discussed in detail. Furthermore, Tb3+ and Eu3+ ion co-doped NaY(MoO4)2 NCs were also prepared, and various emission colors were obtained and tuned from red, orange-red, yellow and yellow-green to green. Energy transfer between the Tb3+ and Eu3+ ions in the NaY(MoO4)2 host matrix has also been demonstrated. Finally, a highly efficient and stable NaY(MoO4)2:0.05Tb,0.04Eu NC-based W-LED device was built, which indicates the promising future application for this material in the field of lighting. The tunable multicolour emission, ease of preparation and nanosize reveal that NaY(MoO4)2:RE3+ NCs have a potential application in full color displays and W-LEDs.
Introduction
Over the past few decades, a great amount of work has been devoted to the synthesis of morphology-controlled colloidal nanocrystals (NCs), the properties of which mostly depend on composition, phase, shape, size and size distribution.1–8 So, rational control over these factors has become an important research issue in recent years. Among the various methods, the hydro/solvothermal method as a general solution-based approach has proven to be an effective and convenient process for preparing various inorganic materials with diverse controllable morphologies and architectures.9,10 Rare earth doped phosphors, such as oxides, fluorides, borates, phosphates, tungstates and molybdates, have been extensively studied because of their potential applications in fluorescence labeling, and solar cell and luminescent devices.11–18 Among them, rare earth doped A(Mo/W)O4 (A = Ca2+, Sr2+, Ba2+) materials with various morphologies have been synthesized during the past few years. Nanoparticles and self-assembled 3D microarchitectures of molybdates and tungstates with a tetragonal scheelite phase have been extensively prepared through several classical soft chemical methods.19,20 Compared with A(Mo/W)O4, other types of tetragonal scheelite tungstates and molybdates also form important compounds with the nominal formula BLn(Mo/WO4)2, where B is a monovalent cation such as Na+, K+, and Ln is a trivalent rare earth cation such as Gd3+, Y3+, Yb3+ and so on. Generally, as host materials for doping RE3+ (Eu3+, Tb3+, Sm3+, etc.) ions, the BLn(Mo/WO4)2 hosts show better acceptance than A(Mo/W)O4 type hosts, as the doped RE3+ ions can easily enter the BLn(Mo/WO4)2 lattice by substituting at the Ln3+ sites. Comparatively, BLn(Mo/WO4)2:RE3+ NCs always exhibit better luminescence properties in the applications of laser crystals and phosphors. However, the Ksp of the BLn(Mo/WO4)2 host is very low and it crystallizes too fast, so it tends to grow into large particles with irregular morphlogy. For example, in our previous work, Eu3+ doped NaY(MoO4)2 micro particles were synthesized via a hydrothermal process, and various morphologies could be obtained through changing the reaction conditions, such as reaction time, temperature, and water/ethanol volume ratio.21 However, all of the samples were found to have a large size (>1 μm) and could not fulfil the size requirements for use in fields of nano optoelectronic devices and biological labeling, and also, the scattering problem caused by micron size particles is inevitable. So, it is of urgent need to find a simple and efficient method in order to prepare well-crystallized, monodisperse and stronger emitting RE3+ doped NaY(MoO4)2 NCs (1–50 nm).
In this work, we demonstrate that a ligand-assisted reprecipitation strategy could be a perfect solution to achieve high quality RE doped NaY(MoO4)2 NCs. The reprecipitation method is a simple technique, through which organic nanoparticles or polymer dots are prepared simultaneously through mixing different solvents. The introduction of capping ligands on the surface of nanoparticles has been extensively researched and has become an increasingly mature technology for controlling their size and morphology. Recent reports about the successful synthesis of perovskite NCs inspired us to control the crystallization of NaY(MoO4)2:RE3+ NCs through a similar reprecipitation process.22,23 Na2MoO4, RE(NO3)3 and Y(CH3COO)3·2H2O were chosen as ion sources, oleylamine (OAm) and oleic acid (OA) as surface ligands, and dimethylformamide (DMF) as the solvent. All of these materials were one-pot mixed. The reaction system was strongly stirred at 50 °C for 0.5 h, and then excess ethanol was added to the reaction system. Ethanol is such a poor solvent for these raw material ions that their solubilities are lower in ethanol than in DMF. However, DMF and ethanol are well miscible, and after such transfer, the NaY(MoO4)2:RE3+ NCs could be formed and deposited at the bottom of the beaker. The surface ligands capped on the surface of the NCs play an important role in controlling the size and morphology of the obtained NaY(MoO4)2 NCs. The prepared samples show a tunable size and morphology, good crystallinity and multicolors. The luminescent intensity of the various morphology NCs is also discussed. In addition, we also investigated the tunable luminescence and energy transfer properties of Tb3+/Eu3+ ion-pair doped NaY(MoO4)2 samples. The as-obtained high quality NCs may have a potential application in nano optoelectronic devices, W-LEDs and displays.24,25

Synthesis

Preparation of a variety of rare earth nitrates. 
In a typical experiment, Eu2O3 (1.5 g) was dissolved in a mixture of deionized water (10 ml) and HNO3 (20 mL) under magnetic stirring at room temperature to form a clear solution. Then the obtained clear solution was placed in a vacuum drying oven at 100 °C for 2 h, after which the Eu(NO3)3·6H2O sample was obtained. The other rare earth nitrates were synthesized using the same method.


Preparation of NaY(MoO4)2:RE3+ (RE = Eu, Sm, Dy, Tb, Eu/Tb) NCs. 
In a typical synthesis of NaY(MoO4)2:0.05Eu3+ NCs, Na2MoO4 (1 mmol), Eu(NO3)3 (0.05 mmol), Y(CH3COO)3·2H2O (0.95 mmol), DMF (15 ml), OA (1 ml) and OAm (0.6 ml) were loaded into a 50 ml three-neck flask and strongly stirred at 80 °C for 30 min to stabilize the clear solution. Then, the reaction mixture was cooled using an ice-water bath and excess ethanol was added. The precipitate was collected by centrifugation, and washed three times with ethanol. Finally, the product was dried in a vacuum drying oven at 50 °C for 30 min. The obtained NaY(MoO4)2:0.05Eu3+ NCs were dispersed in toluene or cyclohexane for further use. Other rare earth ion doped or co-doped NaY(MoO4)2 NCs could be obtained through a similar method.


Fabricating the NC-based W-LED. 
0.05 g NaY(MoO4)2:0.05Tb,0.04Eu NCs were directly dispersed in 5 mL of cyclohexane to form a clear and homogeneous solution. Moderate concentration NC solutions were added into a mixture of epoxy resin (EP400A) and anhydride curing agent (EP400B) with vigorous stirring, and the volume ratio of EP400A to EP400B was kept at 2:1. Then, the obtained epoxy resin solution was mixed homogeneously with the NC cyclohexane solution, and the NC/epoxy resin composite was put into a vacuum chamber, and the mixture was heated at 50 °C for 20 min. After heating the mixture formed a jelly, which was directly coated onto 280 nm LED chips and heated in a vacuum oven at 50 °C for 30 min. Finally, the W-LED was obtained.

Characterization
The phase purity of the as-synthesized samples was characterized by a Rigaku DMAX-2000 (Rigaku Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) diffractometer equipped with a Cu Kα radiation source (k = 0.15405 A, 40 kV, 30 mA) at a scanning rate of 4 degree per min. Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy was carried out on a Nicolet 6700 FT-IR spectrometer, over a range from 400 cm−1 to 4000 cm−1. The UV-vis photoluminescence excitation (PLE) and emission (PL) spectra were determined on a F4600 fluorescence spectrophotometer (Hitachi High-Technologies, Tokyo, Japan) assembled with a 150 W xenon lamp as the excitation source. A JEOL JEM-200CX microscope operating at 160 kV in bright-field mode was used for the transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns were obtained on a JEOL JEM-2010 electron microscope operating at 200 kV. The luminescence decay curves were obtained using a FLSP9200 fluorescence spectrophotometer (Edinburgh Instruments Ltd, U.K.). A JEOL JSM-7500F microscope operated at an acceleration voltage of 15 kV equipped with energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX) facilities was used for elemental studies. A PR-670 spectrum scanner (Photo Research Companies, USA, scan wavelength region 380–780 nm) was used for analysing the spectra of the fabricated W-LED.
Results and discussion
Phase and surface ligands
The composition and structure of the products obtained were characterized by PXRD and the results are shown in Fig. 1a. All of the experimental PXRD patterns of the samples were identified by comparison with the reference JCPDS Card No. 52-1802. The as-prepared samples are generally of a single phase, consistent with the standard card, with no other impurities found, which indicates that the doped rare earth ions do not change the phase of NaY(MoO4)2. All of the other reflection peaks are characteristic of a NaY(MoO4)2 tetragonal phase (space group: I41/a). The calculated lattice constants are a = b = 5.343 Å and c = 11.743 Å. These PXRD results indicate that NaY(MoO4)2:RE can be successfully prepared through the proposed direct ligand-assisted reprecipitation strategy without any further annealing treatment. So, in our later research, we only use NaY(MoO4)2:Eu as a typical example to explain the morphologies, luminescence properties, and the possible formation mechanism of the products. The surface ligands were characterized by FT-IR spectroscopy, and a typical NaY(MoO4)2:Eu FT-IR spectrum is shown in Fig. 1b. The bands at 2925 cm−1 and 2850 cm−1 can be ascribed to the antisymmetric and symmetric stretching modes of –C–C– in OA, respectively, whereas the bands at 1630 cm−1 can be attributed to the bending vibration of –CO– in OA. A broad band at 3440 cm−1 is assigned to the –N–H– stretching of the NH2 group, and the bands at 1388 cm−1 are assigned to the –C–N– stretching modes in OAM. The above results indicate that the OAM and OA are capped on the surface of the NaY(MoO4)2:RE3+ NCs. The oily groups on the sample surface make the sample well dispersible in non-polar solvents to form a stable clear colloidal solution.26,27 The composition of typical NaY(MoO4)2:Eu NCs was investigated using electron energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS, Fig. S1†). According to the results from EDS, the existing chemical composition is in agreement with the target elemental composition, implying that the Eu3+ ions have substituted the Y3+ sites in the NaY(MoO4)2 host lattice.

Effect of the OAm concentration on the shape of the products
The TEM images provide direct information about the size and typical shape of the as-obtained NaY(MoO4)2:Eu NCs. The size and morphology of the as-prepared samples are strongly affected by the concentration of OAm in the solvent mixture. Fig. 2 shows the TEM images of the products obtained in the reaction system with different OA/OAm volume ratios and the high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HR-TEM) image of the prepared NCs. In our early attempts, only 1 ml of OA was added to the system for morphology control, and the obtained products showed serious agglomeration, and the size was on the micro-scale. So, a moderate amount of OAm was introduced to the mixed solvent in order to co-control the shape of the products. When the OA/OAm volume ratio (ml) is 1:1, super small nanoparticles without a specific morphology are formed, with a size of about 1–2 nm. Upon decreasing the amount of OAm (0.8 ml) used, most of the samples showed a water chestnut-like morphology, with each large particle consisting of several smaller particles, and the average size of the products reached 8 nm (Fig. 2b). A further decrease in the OAm caused the formation of quasi-square NaY(MoO4)2:0.05Eu NCs with an average diameter of about 10 nm (Fig. 2c). The corresponding HRTEM image is shown in Fig. 2f with an interplanar spacing of 0.26 nm, corresponding to the d spacing for the (200) planes of tetragonal NaY(MoO4)2. When the volume ratio of OA:OAm reached 1:0.4, wheat-like NCs with a length ranging from 12–15 nm were obtained (Fig. 2d). When the amount of added OAm was 0.2 ml, the size of the wheat-like NCs further increased and exceeded 20 nm (Fig. 2e). The TEM images of these materials demonstrate that OAm plays an important role in controlling the size and morphology of the NaY(MoO4)2:RE3+ NCs. In general, the size of the product increases upon reducing the amount of OAm used. The function of the OAm molecules is speculated as follows: (1) capping on the external surface of NCs to form the OAm layer, (2) slowing the diffusion rate of the anions and cations and (3) greatly reducing the collision probability of ions. All of these factors tend to restrain the growth rate of the NaY(MoO4)2 NCs. Moreover, the metal ions can be coordinated by OAm, further reducing the growth rate, so that the growth rate of the grains can be slowed down, which is more advantageous for decreasing the particle size.

Luminescence properties of Eu3+ doped NaY(MoO4)2 NCs with different shapes
The influence of the morphologies on the luminescence properties of NaY(MoO4)2:Eu3+ is shown in Fig. 3. The inset shows a photograph of quasi-square NaY(MoO4)2:Eu3+ dispersed in cyclohexane, irradiated by a 254 nm UV emission lamp. As we know, the surface area of the nanoparticles increases when the size decreases. A large surface area introduces a large number of defects into the NCs, which is a drawback for the photoluminescence (PL) intensity of the NCs because they provide nonradiative recombination routes for electrons and holes. Samples obtained with different OAm volumes were named a (1 ml), b (0.8 ml), c (0.6 ml), d (0.4 ml) and e (0.2 ml), respectively. Upon increasing the size of the as-prepared NCs, there was an obvious increase in the red emission intensity, except for samples c and d. Although sample d has a larger size than that of c, the irregular shape of d compared to that of c maybe introduces more scattering issues, which restricts the PL intensity. Because the obtained NaY(MoO4)2:Eu3+ NCs controlled by a OA/OAm volume ratio at 1:0.6 have a more regular morphology, good crystallinity and excellent emission intensity, all of the samples were prepared at a OA/OAm volume ratio of 1:0.6 in the later studies.

PLE and PL spectrum of various RE doped NaY(MoO4)2 NCs

Fig. 4 shows the luminescence spectra of RE3+ (RE = Eu, Sm, Dy and Tb) ion doped NaY(MoO4)2 NCs, with doped molar ratios of 5%. As one of the most frequently used red emitting activators in rare earth ion doped materials, Eu3+ mainly shows characteristic emissions resulting from the transitions of 5D0,1,2 → 7FJ (J = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4). In Fig. 4a, two strong emission peaks can be observed, located at 593 and 616 nm, which can be attributed to the 5D0 → 7F1 and 5D0 → 7F2 transitions of Eu3+, respectively. The PL spectra of the Eu3+ doped samples with different doping concentrations are shown in Fig. S2.† When the doped molar ratio is 7%, the emission intensity reaches a maximum, and as the doped molar ratio is further increased, the emission starts to reduce, as a result of the concentration quenching effect. The excitation spectrum on the left, monitored at 616 nm, is composed of an intense broad band ranging from 200 to 350 nm and a sequence of narrow weak peaks ranging from 350 to 450 nm. The broad excitation band centered at about 275 nm can be attributed to the O2−–Mo6+ charge transfer band (CTB), and the narrow lines beyond 350 nm are due to the characteristic f–f transitions of Eu3+ within its 4f6 configuration. Similar to NaY(MoO4)2:Eu3+, the PL excitation spectra of the Sm3+, Dy3+ and Tb3+ singly doped NaY(MoO4)2 samples also have a broad charge transfer excitation band from 200 to 320 and narrow weak excitation lines from the characteristic f–f transitions of the doped RE ions. The PL spectrums of NaY(MoO4)2:Sm3+ and NaY(MoO4)2:Dy3+ are shown in Fig. 4b and c, respectively. For the NaY(MoO4)2:Sm3+ samples, under 280 nm UV radiation excitation, the as-prepared NaY(MoO4)2:Sm3+ exhibits emission peaks at 566, 604 and 645 nm due to the 4G5/2 → 6H5/2, 4G5/2 → 6H7/2 and 4G5/2 → 6H9/2 transitions, respectively. The excitation of the molybdate groups yields the characteristic blue-yellow emission of Dy3+ at 480 nm (4F9/2 → 6H15/2, blue) and 576 nm (4F9/2 → 6H13/2, yellow), respectively. Under 280 nm UV excitation, the emission spectrum of the NaY(MoO4)2:Tb3+ sample consists of the 5D3,4 → 7FJ transitions of Tb3+, i.e. 490 nm (5D4 → 7F6), 546 nm (5D4 → 7F5), 586 nm (5D4 → 7F4), 620 nm (5D4 → 7F3), respectively. These results are consistent with those of other RE3+ doped compounds that have been reported in previous literature.9,19,26,28

Tuning the PL properties of the as-prepared Tb3+ and Eu3+ co-doped NaY(MoO4)2 samples
It has been recognized that multiple emission peaks could be achieved by doping different rare earth ions in the host, because the simultaneous luminescence of Eu3+, Sm3+, Dy3+ and Tb3+ can occur. Co-doped systems have been reported previously, such as LaOF:RE, LaOCl:RE and GdOF:RE, and a variety of colors could be efficiently adjusted by varying the doping ions.29–32 In our work, different concentrations of Tb3+ and Eu3+ ions were used to synthesize co-doped NCs. The obtained NaY(MoO4)2:0.05Tb, NaY(MoO4)2:0.05Tb,0.01Eu, NaY(MoO4)2:0.05Tb,0.02Eu, NaY(MoO4)2:0.05Tb,0.03Eu, NaY(MoO4)2:0.05Tb,0.04Eu, and NaY(MoO4)2:0.05Eu NCs were labeled as A, B, C, D, E, and F, respectively. The emission spectra of these samples are shown in Fig. 5a. Only the characteristic emissions of Tb3+ at 490, 546, 586 and 620 nm can be observed for the NaY(MoO4)2:0.05Tb NCs, whereas, once Eu3+ is introduced to the host, the NCs show the above typical emissions of Eu3+ besides the emissions of Tb3+ mainly located at 593 and 616 nm. Keeping the Tb3+ doped molar ratio at 5%, upon increasing the Eu3+ molar ratio, the Eu3+ emission intensities begin to increase and the Tb3+ emission intensities decrease gradually. Fig. 5b shows the dependence luminescence intensities of Tb3+ (546 nm) and Eu3+ (616 nm) ions in the series of NCs. It is worth noting that the emission intensity of Eu3+ in NaY(MoO4)2:0.05Tb,0.04Eu is stronger than in NaY(MoO4)2:0.05Eu. However, in the single-doped system (Fig. S2†), the emission intensity of Eu3+ in NaY(MoO4)2:0.05Eu is stronger than that in NaY(MoO4)2:0.04Eu, so the previously described opposite result may be due to the energy transfer from Tb3+ to Eu3+.

Tunable multicolors and energy transfer
In order to demonstrate the energy transfer process in the co-doped system, the PL decay curves were recorded. Fig. 6a exhibits the decay curves and lifetime of Tb3+, and the energy-transfer efficiency from Tb3+ to Eu3+ was calculated. All of the samples were excited at 271 nm, and the lifetime decay curves were curve fitted. All of the decay curves can be well fitted by a double-exponential equation given by the following: I(t) = I0 + A1exp(−t/τ1) + A2exp(−t/τ2)(1)where I0 is the initial emission intensity and I(t) is the emission intensity at time t, A1 and A2 are constants, and τ1and τ2 are the decay times of the exponential components. The average luminescence lifetime for the Tb3+ ions as a function of the different Eu3+ concentrations can be calculated using the following equation: τx = (A1τ12 + A2τ22)/(A1τ1 + A2τ2).(2)

According to the above formula, the lifetimes of the Tb3+ ions (τx) were calculated to be 0.551, 0.532, 0.506, 0.451 and 0.433 ms for NaY(MoO4)2:0.05Tb3+,xEu3+ for x = 0, 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, and 0.04, respectively. These results indicate that the introduction of Eu3+ ions causes the PL lifetime to decrease for Tb3+, which indicates the electron transfer (ET) process between Tb3+ to Eu3+ in NaY(MoO4)2 NCs. The energy-transfer efficiency (ηT) from Tb3+ to Eu3+ can be calculated based on the following formula: ηT = 1 − τx/τ0(3)where τ0 and τx are the decay lifetimes of the donor Tb3+ ions with and without activator Eu3+ ions, respectively. The related parameters are summarized in Table 1. Clearly, it can be seen from Table 1 that upon an increase in the Eu3+ concentration, the energy transfer efficiency from Tb3+ to Eu3+ increases gradually. When the doping concentration of Eu3+ is 4 mol%, the ηT value of Eu3+ reaches as high as 21.42%. On the basis of the above experimental results, multiple colors can be obtained and tuned from red, orange-red, yellow, and yellow-green to deep green by reasonably adjusting the two doped ion concentrations. These can be confirmed from the corresponding CIE chromaticity diagram shown in Fig. 6b. The values of the CIE parameters of the series of co-doped NCs are summarized in Table 1. Our research may find potential applications in the fields of light display systems and optoelectronic devices.33–35

NC based W-LED with high efficiency and stability
In recent decades, white light-emitting diodes (W-LEDs) have attracted a great deal of attention in the field of solid-state lighting due to their excellent properties. Commercial W-LEDs are usually fabricated by combining a blue GaN-based LED chip with conventional yellow-emitting phosphors (YAG:Ce). Since it lacks a sufficient red emission composition, this method suffers from some typical problems, such as a low color rendering index (CRI) and a higher correlated color temperature (CCT). Besides this, another solution has also been explored to achieve white light emission, which utilizes UV chips to excite an appropriate combination of red, green and blue (RGB) phosphors. However, there are also problems with this method because the red and green phosphors in the device can strongly reabsorb the blue light emission and further lead to a decrease in the luminescence efficiency. In our work, these mentioned problems have been solved. We encapsulated the 280 nm UV chip with the NaY(MoO4)2:0.05Tb,0.04Eu NC/epoxy composite (Fig. 7a), which functioned not only as the light conversion material, but also as the encapsulant material. The NCs were homogeneously dispersed in cyclohexane and blended with epoxy resin. In this way, the NCs in the epoxy resin suffer less from the heat generated by the chip. And, due to the far smaller size of the NCs compared with those of conventional phosphors, the light scattering and refraction in the LED might be greatly improved as well. Fig. 7b shows a photograph of the NC based W-LED operated at 60 mA to obtain a high brightness emission, with CIE color coordinates of (0.4751, 0.4180) and a color temperature (Tc) of 2510 K (Fig. 7c), indicating warm white light emission from the as-prepared W-LED. This successfully solves the low CRI problem, which was reported in previous studies, due to the lack of a red component.36–38 The electroluminescence (EL) spectra and power efficiency of the W-LED under different forward bias currents are shown in Fig. 7d and e, respectively. These results demonstrate the favorable emission stability of the W-LED under different current intensities. The power efficiency (92.5 lm W−1) was found to be higher than in some similar reports.39–41 So, we firmly believe that this highly efficient, stable W-LED will play a more important role in the field of lighting.

Conclusions
In summary, NaY(MoO4)2:RE3+ (RE = Eu, Sm, Dy, and Tb) NCs have been successfully synthesized using a facile, convenient and efficient ligand-assisted reprecipitation strategy and show excellent optical properties. The results indicate that the use of OAm plays an important role in controlling the size and morphology of the NCs. NaY(MoO4)2 NCs were formed with various sizes ranging from 1 nm to 20 nm and shape diversification from super small dots to quasi-squares. Moreover, the function of OAm and the possible formation mechanism for NaY(MoO4)2 NCs with diverse sizes were analyzed, and the luminescence properties of Eu3+ doped NaY(MoO4)2 NCs with different shapes were also discussed. The energy transfer properties from Tb3+ to Eu3+ in the NaY(MoO4)2 host were also observed in our work. A variety of colors can be efficiently adjusted by changing the amount of Tb3+ and Eu3+ in the NaY(MoO4)2 host, meaning that these materials may have potential applications in lighting and field-emission display devices. This work is expected to provide important information on tunable NCs morphologies, energy transfer and the multicolor-controlled mechanism of other RE3+ doped compounds, such as phosphates, tungstates, fluorides, etc. Finally, we used the NaY(MoO4)2:0.05Tb,0.04Eu NCs to construct a W-LED, and the NC based W-LED was shown to have high efficiency and stability, which indicates the promising future application of this device in the field of lighting.
