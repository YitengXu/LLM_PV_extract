    , Accepted 19th October 2010First published on 15th November 2010AbstractNew C60 dimers 1, 2 and 3 that differ in the distance between the two balls, connected through pleiadene bridges have been synthesized. Different synthetic strategies have been used to prepare C60 dimers 1–3. A diastereoisomeric mixture was obtained for C60 dimer 1, which was separated by column chromatography and characterized by NMR. By CV measurements, no interaction between the two balls was found in the ground state in any type of C60 dimer. By reduction with dimeric benzylnicotinamide [(BNA)2], a two electron reductant, the interaction between both C60 units has been analyzed using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR). For C60 dimer 3, upon addition of 1 equivalent (BNA)2 no electronic interaction in the C60˙−–C60˙− was observed due to the long distance between the C60 balls (20 Å). However, for C60 dimer 1, where the distance between radicals is shorter, 10 Å, the electronic interaction in the di(radical anion), C60˙−–C60˙− in the presence of 1 equivalent of (BNA)2 was observed by EPR, corresponding to a triplet biradical.
Introduction
The project entitled “Duranes: Ultrahard high-strength organic polymeric materials” was initiated by Prof. Fred Wudl in 1998 during Prof. Angela Sastre's postdoctoral stay at UCLA. The name “duranes” was assigned taking into account the Spanish term “duro” that means hard. Prof. Wudl wanted to develop a new approach to extended networks based on very high-strength organic polymeric materials with potential applications as structural materials of strengths approaching that of diamond. For that purpose, we used building blocks based on 6b,10b-dihydrobenzo[j]cyclobut[a]acenaphthylene (DBCA).1DBCA systems are mainly attractive because they are capable of van der Waals interactions between the cofacially oriented DBCA units which could allow effective electronic coupling giving rise to a wirelike material. Moreover, DBCA units can undergo, upon thermolysis or photolysis, the opening of its four membered ring to form a biradicaloid species (“pleiadene”)2 that rapidly dimerizes to form the pleiadene dimer,3 which presents an intramolecular through-space interaction between the benzene- and naphthalene-type moieties (Scheme 1).
 Scheme 1  Formation of the pleiadene dimer from thermolysis or photolysis of DBCA. 
So far the DBCA ring system has been used for the preparation of pleiadene-based polymers4,5 and DBCA-stilbene derivatives.6 Moreover, the pleiadene dimerization has been applied by Stille's group for a chain extension reaction in polymer synthesis7 and DBCA has been used as o-quinodimethane precursor and incorporated by a [4 + 2] cycloaddition to fullerene[C60] by Mullen's group.8
In the present work, we want to take advantage of DBCA reactivity to connect two C60 units through pleiadene bridges. Fullerene dimers9 are very attractive for applications in areas such as artificial photosynthesis,10 molecular electronic devices11,12 and in supramolecular chemistry.13 Although fullerene dimers are known to exhibit poor solubility in common organic solvents, which has prevented their use in optoelectronic devices to a great extent, their photovoltaic applications are, however, of interest because they are expected to improve the molar absorptivity, due to the presence of two fullerenes,14 and they will be able to act as multielectron acceptor systems in an easier way than mono fullerene does.15 Recently, soluble [60]- and [70]fullerene homo- and heterodimers linked through 2-pyrazolino–pyrrolidino bridges have been incorporated in solar cell devices. Bulk-heterojunction solar cells based on this novel C70 homodimer blended with P3HT demonstrated higher quantum and power conversion efficiencies of 37 and 1%, respectively, compared to those of [60]fullerene dimers.16
On the other hand, the synthesis of chiral fulleroderivatives obtained by diastereo- and enantioselective syntheses is becoming more and more interesting in fields such as materials science and medicinal chemistry.17 Recently the synthesis of diastereoisomerically pure fulleropyrrolidines as chiral platforms for the design of optically active liquid crystals has been published.18
Herein we report different synthetic strategies to prepare C60 dimers 1, 2 and 3 that differ in the distance between the two balls, connected through pleiadene bridges. C60 dimer 1 presents a close proximity between the C60 units, whereas C60 dimers 2 and 3 have a longer distance between the C60 units. A diastereoisomeric mixture was obtained for C60 dimer 1, being separated by column chromatography and characterized by NMR. The interaction between the two C60 balls in both types of dimers was studied by CV measurements. We also report the electron transfer (ET) reduction of C60 dimers 1 and 3 by photoinduced ET with dimeric benzylnicotinamide [(BNA)2] as a two electron reductant. In our case, we found by EPR an interaction in the di(radical anion), C60˙−–C60˙− in C60 dimer 1, which corresponds to a triplet biradical. This dimer would be the first example of two fullerenes presenting communication through π–π overlap although they are separated by several C–C single bonds.

Results and discussion
Synthesis
The preparation of C60 dimer 1 was carried out by two different strategies, both starting from the enantiomeric mixture of 8(9)-carboxaldehyde–DBCA 4.6 In the first one, a Prato reaction19 of formyl derivative 4 with [60]fullerene in the presence of N-methylglycine gave rise to a diastereoisomeric mixture of two couples of enantiomers 5a,b and 5c,d in 24% and 14% yield respectively, easily separated by column chromatography (Scheme 2).20 The couple 5a,b presents similar UV-vis, IR and MS-data but different 1H-NMR chemical shifts of the pyrrolidine and the cyclobutene protons than the couple 5c,d (see ESI†). The couple 5a,b was used in the final [4 + 2] cycloaddition to the fullerene sphere, carried out in refluxing 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene and reaching a yield in dimer 1 of 60% as a mixture of the two couples of enantiomers 1a,b (35%) and 1c,d (25%) also separated by regular column chromatography. A similar mixture of the four possible compounds 1a–d was obtained when Diels–Alder reaction was accomplished using the couple 5c,d. This result can be easily explained due to the existence of the planar pleiadene intermediate 6 produced by retro [2 + 2] opening of the cyclobutene of the DBCA unit (Scheme 3). Similar spectroscopic and spectrometric analyses were obtained for dimers 1a,b and 1c,d.

 Scheme 3  Synthesis of [60]fullerene dimer 1: (a) C60, 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene, reflux, 1 h, 60%. 
The second route was just the opposite, starting with a [4 + 2] cycloaddition of 4 to [60]fullerene to obtain the formyl derivatives 7a,b as a couple of enantiomers (32%), and using them as starting compound in a Prato reaction with [60]fullerene and N-methylglycine. As already stated in the previously described synthetic route, the final column chromatographic purification of the crude mixture (SiO2, hexane/toluene 1:1) afforded two separated fractions, corresponding to two different couples of enantiomers 1a,b (25%) and 1c,d (17%) (Scheme 4).
 Scheme 4  Synthesis of [60]fullerene dimer 1: (a) C60, 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene, reflux, 3 h, 32%; (b) C60, sarcosine, ODCB, reflux, 45 min, 42%. 
The overall yield for dimers 1a–d using the route 1 (Prato + Diels–Alder), 23%, was almost two times higher than the one obtained using the route 2 (Diels–Alder + Prato), 13%. This difference arises from the higher yield obtained for the Diels–Alder reaction between 5 and C60 to get 1 in comparison to the DA reaction between 4 and C60 to get 7. In the former case, the formation of bisadducts due to the presence of a C60 ring can be sterically hindered and this effect is not affecting in the second case.
The synthesis of C60 dimers 2 and 3 is depicted in Scheme 5. Dimerization of 4 in refluxing α-chloronaphthalene and chromatographic purification of the crude mixture gave two different fractions, namely 8a,b (36%) as a mixture of enantiomers, and 8c (27%) as a meso compound. According to previously reported 1H-NMR spectroscopic data of pleiadene dimers,48a–c dimers correspond to the anti distribution, which is also supported by the fact that the formyl substituent of DBCA 4 could give rise to electronically favorable secondary orbital interactions in the [4 + 4] cycloaddition. In any case, the presence of syn-dimers was not observed. Both, 8a,b and 8c were indistinctly used to prepare 2 and 3 through a Prato reaction, with [60]fullerene and either N-methylglycine or N-octylglycine, respectively. C60 dimers 2, being very insoluble, were only characterized by MS. In the case of dimers 3, we did not find any different spectroscopic feature in the characterization of fullerene dimers 3a and 3b obtained either from 8a,b or 8c.

The synthesis of dimer 2 was also afforded by [4 + 4] cycloaddition of DBCA–C605 heating in refluxing α-chloronaphthalene, the temperature needed to open the DBCA moiety to obtain the pleiadene.4 Under these conditions, retro-Prato reaction21 takes place liberating pristine C60 and a mixture of C60 dimers 1 and 2 was obtained (identified by MALDI-TOF), which was impossible to separate by chromatographic techniques.
Electrochemistry
The redox behavior of [60]fullerene dimers 1 and 3 was studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV) as it is shown in Fig. 2. Similar CV were obtained for 1a,b and 1c,d and for 3a and 3b. The voltammograms recorded show two quasi-reversible reduction waves corresponding to fullerene moieties. We cannot see any experimental feature which indicates an intramolecular interaction between the fullerene spheres. The reduction waves recorded have potentials ca. 120–150 mV more negative than those of the pristine [60]fullerene,22 and this is a well known consequence of the saturation of a double bond on the fullerene sphere, which raises the LUMO energy level.23 So, according to electrochemical data, we can affirm that the fullerene moieties in dimers 1 and 3 behave in an independent manner in the ground state. Similar results were obtained in previous studies carried out by Wudl on fullerene dimers with phenylene24 spacers connecting methanofullerenes and in methanofullerenes incorporated into polyester and polyurethane polymers.25

Electron transfer
reduction


Electron transfer (ET) reduction of C60 dimers 1 and 3 was carried out by photoinduced ET with dimeric benzylnicotinamide [(BNA)2] as a two electron reductant.26 It has been established that two equivalents of C60 can be reduced by (BNA)2 quantitatively under photoirradiation of C60 in PhCN. Thus, photoirradition of C60 dimer 1 with 0.5 equivalents of (BNA)2 afforded an EPR spectrum of one-electron reduced species of 1, C60–C60˙− (Fig. 3a), which is typical for the one-electron reduced species of C60 derivatives with g = 2.000.27,28 In the presence of 1 equivalent of (BNA)2 the two-electron reduced specie, C60˙−–C60˙−, is formed. In contrast to σ-bonded C60 dimers, which are diamagnetic (singlet biradical),29 the strong EPR signal due to C60˙− is still observed for C60˙−–C60˙− in Fig. 3b where a triplet biradical (D = 26.2 G) is also clearly observed.29,30 The strength and nature of the interaction between two spin-containing units can be characterized by the value of spin–spin exchange coupling (2J), which is equivalent to the singlet–triplet (S–T) energy gap. The result in Fig. 3b suggests that the S–T energy gap is small enough to leave most C60˙− units independent doublet radical.31 However, a small portion exists as a triplet. From the fine structure parameter D (obtained from shoulder peaks in Fig. 3b) the distance between the two C60˙− units was determined to be 10 Å using eqn (1) (Fig. 4). D (G) = 27800/r3 (Å)(1)

 Fig. 4  Optimized structure of dimer 1 with (a) LUMO and (b) LUMO+1 calculated by DFT at the B3LYP/6-31(d) basis set. 
This distance agrees with the center-to-center distance between C60˙− units of 1 estimated by DFT calculation at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) basis set as shown in Fig. 4. The LUMO and LUMO+1 are localized on fullerene moieties, respectively. It should be noted that the observed D value (26.2 G) is significantly smaller than that of the triplet of C602− (53 G)32 but larger than that of intermolecular triplet state of γ-cyclodextrin bicapped C60˙− (6.8 G).33
For the C60 dimer 3b only the presence of the C60 radical anion, C60–C60˙−, was observed after photoirradiation in the presence of 0.5 equivalents of (BNA)2 (Fig. 5a) and no zero-field splitting signal (shoulder peaks) is observed in the presence of 1 equivalent of (BNA)2 due to the long distance between the C60 units (Fig. 5). The calculated distance between fullerenes is 20 Å as shown in Fig. 6. From eqn (1), the D value for 3b should be 3.5 G. Thus, the zero-field splitting signals for two-electron reduced 3b would be overlapped by the strong center signal at g = 2.0000.

Conclusions
Compounds 1–3, each containing two fullerene moieties connected through pleiadene bridges, have been synthesized and characterized. Electrochemical studies did not show any interaction between the C60 subunits, as we only found two-electron reductions. However, EPR characterization of the C60˙−–C60˙− two-electron reduced dimer 1 indicated the existence of communication between both C60 moieties. This dimer would be the first example of two fullerenes presenting communication through π–π overlap although they are separated by several C–C single bonds. The photovoltaic applications of the dimers described in this work are currently underway.
Experimental

Cyclic voltammetry

Cyclic voltammetric data were measured using a µAUTOLAB type III potentiostat/galvanostat with a three-electrode configuration system. The experiments were carried out under an atmospheric pressure of Ar, with 3 ml of a 5 mM deaerated solution of the compound in benzonitrile containing 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate as the electrolyte, at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. A single crystal platinum electrode (1 mm diameter) and a platinum wire were used as working and counter electrodes, respectively. The measured potentials were recorded with respect to a Ag/AgNO3 (0.01 M) reference electrode, and converted to values vs.SCE by adding 0.29 V.34
Synthesis and characterization
All reagents were purchased from commercial suppliers and used without further purification unless otherwise noted. Commercial TLC plates (silica gel 60 F254, SDS) were used to monitor the progress of the reaction, with spots observed under UV light at 254 and 365 nm. Column chromatography was performed with silica gel 60 Å (particle size 40–63 µm, SDS). NMR spectra were taken using a 300 MHz Bruker Avance 300. Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption measurements were taken on a ThermoSpectronic Helios γ spectrophotometer. Infrared measurements were taken with a Fourier Transform (FT-IR) ThermoNicolet model IR 200 Spectrometer in transmission mode with KBr. Mass spectra were obtained from a Bruker Reflex III matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight (MALDI-TOF) spectrometer using dithranol, trans-2-[3-(4-tert-butylphenyl)-2-methyl-2-propenylidene]malononitrile (DCTB) or 7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ) as matrix.

After cooling to room temperature, 100 mL of methanol were added and a brown solid was obtained, which was purified by column chromatography (SiO2, hexane/toluene 1:1) obtaining two different fractions 5a,b (33 mg, 24% yield) and 5c,d (20 mg, 14% yield), both as dark brown powders.
