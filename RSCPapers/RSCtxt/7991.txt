    , Accepted 15th May 2022First published on 16th May 2022AbstractThe high-performance bi-functional electrochromic supercapacitor constitutes the critical technology for intelligent energy conversion and storage. Facilitating ion/electron transport and intercalation/deintercalation by rational design of the highly porous structure with a large specific surface area is one of the most effective strategies to promote its electrochemical redox reaction. However, difficult issues such as unsatisfactory energy storage due to simple porous structures and severe performance degradation during long-term electrochemical cycles still remain. Inspired by the natural geotexture of forests, a novel Ni/Co-based layered double hydroxide (Ni/Co-LDH) derived from the metal–organic framework grown on ZnO nanotubes on transparent conducting substrates with diverse porous structures is proposed to simulate the “rock-soil-tree-leaf” system. Excellent transmittance modulation, switching speed, specific capacity and durability are realized due to the large specific surface area of the three-dimensional network structured ZnO@Ni/Co-LDH, enhanced OH− capture ability of ZnO, improved electrochemical activity by Ni/Co incorporation and its mixed charge storage behavior. Remarkable electrochromic and energy storage performance of the ZnO@Ni/Co-LDH device is also demonstrated. It serves as an intelligent energy conversion and storage platform to realize automatic optical switching by solar energy collection and charge storage/release. The new insights will pave the way for next-generation intelligent technologies towards a sustainable and liveable future life.
1. Introduction
Advances in electrical economy largely rely on the development and optimization of various energy storage and conversion technologies and materials. Supercapacitors, which can bridge the gap between conventional capacitors and batteries in terms of energy capacity and power burst, are expected to play an important role due to the advantages of high power density and rate capability, rapid charge and discharge, and long-term durability.1–3 However, the popularity of diverse smart electronic devices calls for extra functions of supercapacitors except for power supply, such as appearance color variation according to the charged state, and to monitor the state of charge simply by visual inspection. Electrochromism offers an effective way to endow supercapacitors with such abilities. In general, battery/pseudocapacitor and electrochromic (EC) devices have similar electrode materials, device structure and faradaic reactions.4–7 In this regard, the combination of energy storage and electrochromism can be achieved to realize the versatile utilization of supercapacitors. The required service of EC supercapacitors depends on both optical and electrochemical properties of the devices, and enhanced color contrast and energy density are of great interest since it allows larger optical transmittance modulation and more energy storage. There are generally two strategies to improve their performance, one is to increase the number of the exposed active sites by rational design of the structure and morphology of the ideal electrode materials,8,9 and the other is to optimize the assembly technology by selection of the appropriate electrolyte and complementary electrode materials.10 These two strategies are not mutually exclusive; they can be addressed simultaneously to achieve a significantly improved EC and energy storage performance.
Today, EC technology based on transition metal oxides (e.g. NiO,11 Co3O4,12 TiO2,13 and V2O5 (ref. 14)) and conducting polymers (e.g. polyaniline15,16 and polythiophene17) is indeed adequate for the conventional EC applications, such as in variable-transmittance glazing for energy-efficient buildings,18–20 but the unsatisfactory energy storage due to their intrinsic low porosity and specific surface area limits their use in the EC supercapacitors. Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) are highly porous materials; using MOFs as sacrificial materials can obtain highly controlled nanostructured materials with increased electrical conductivity and sufficient EC redox-active sites to achieve the bifunction of electrochromism and energy storage with enhanced optical modulation and energy density.4,21 MOF-derived layered double hydroxides (LDHs) have been investigated widely in recent studies, and this has pointed out the superiority of them as promising electrode materials toward energy storage applications, in terms of features including their unique 2D supramolecular layered structure, large specific surface area, high porosity, rich active sites and excellent electronic properties,21,22 which are also beneficial to the EC performance. In addition, nickel (Ni)-based and cobalt (Co)-based MOF-derived materials are of particular interest for delivering electrochemical activity, and they exhibit high redox activity and large specific capacity in a faradaic EC process.23,24 Recently, MnO2@Co–Ni LDH has been successfully prepared by Luo et al. via a facile self-templating cation-exchange method for enhanced energy storage.25 However, to our knowledge, there are no reports on LDHs with both EC and energy storage characteristics.
A tricky problem in the application of Ni/Co-based LDHs derived from MOFs in the EC energy storage field is the controlled growth of the MOF films on the electrodes since MOFs are difficult to disperse uniformly in solvents. Drop casting and spin coating are commonly used to fabricate MOF films. However, direct growth by the hydrothermal method on an electrode substrate from the requisite metal salt and organic ligand precursors offers better mechanical contact between the film and the substrate than that achieved by simple adhesion of them.26 Inspired by the synthesis of inorganic core–shell materials,27 organic ligands can be introduced into the pre-prepared templates on the substrate to obtain the core–shell heterogeneous MOF films. The challenge is to remove the unwanted templates after using them. Oliver et al. reported that the Cu2O template could be spontaneously etched during the synthetic procedure to react with the added tricarboxylic acid (BTC) and tetrabutylammonium tetrafluoroborate to form HKUST-1 MOF films.28
Inspired by the intelligent natural geotexture of forests predominantly composed of trees established through planting and/or seeding in the soil covered on the underground rock, and their fascinating synergistic effects in ion transport,29 herein, we demonstrate an effective strategy to construct three-dimensional (3D) ZnO@zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8)-derived ZnO@Ni/Co-LDH films for high-performance EC energy storage devices for the first time. Glass substrates coated with transparent and electrically conducting layers of fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) were used to simulate the soil-rock structure to supply abundant growth sites and adhesive force for active materials to the substrate. ZnO nanotubes (NTs) served as both the sacrificial template and the reactant to participate in the crystallization of ZnO@ZIF-8 MOF films. Ni/Co-LDH was prepared by etching ZIF-8, and the obtained ZnO@Ni/Co-LDH simulated porous tree trunks with the Ni/Co-LDH bark to facilitate the transport of ions and electrons. ZnO@Ni/Co-LDH was firmly rooted in the FTO coating through in situ growth. Ni/Co-LDH accumulated on top of the trucks played the role of leaves. It has an ultra-high specific surface area and plenty of active sites for ion/electron intercalation/deintercalation. The incorporation of Ni and Co endowed the entire film with enhanced EC and energy storage functions (Fig. 1a) due to improved electrochemical activity and more exposed active sites. The device based on the ZnO@Ni/Co-LDH film with the electrolyte of 1 M KOH/PVA solidified gel was also fabricated, exhibiting excellent EC performance and energy storage with large optical modulation, fast response, outstanding electrochemical and optical durability, and high energy density and power density. The device was further connected with photovoltaic cells (PVs) to realize low power consuming automatic dynamic dimming for effective utilization of energy.

W. = 89000–98000, 87.0–89.0% hydrolyzed), poly(1,1-difluoroethylene) (PVDF, 5130), acetylene carbon black (ACET), charcoal active powder (AC), 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP, 99.0%) and conductive carbon cloth (CC, WOS1009, 5 mΩ cm2) were used as received without further purification. All aqueous solutions were prepared using deionized water with a resistivity of 18.2 MΩ cm. FTO-coated glass substrates having a resistance of 6 Ω per square were purchased from Advent South China Xiang Science & Technology.
2.2 Synthetic procedure

2.2.1 Synthesis of ZnO NTs. 
FTO-coated glass substrates were ultrasonically cleaned in acetone, ethanol and deionized water for 30 min each. ZnO nanorod (NR) arrays were prepared at 80 °C by applying a constant current density of 0.25 mA cm−2 for 30 min on a 2 × 1 cm2 FTO-coated glass substrate with a Pt plate as the counter electrode. The electrolyte used was an aqueous solution composed of 5 mM Zn(NO3)2·6H2O and 5 mM HMTA. After electrodeposition, the sample was removed from the electrolyte and immediately rinsed with flowing deionized water to remove any residual salt from the surface. The ZnO NR arrays were then selectively dissolved to form ZnO NTs by applying a constant cathode current density of 1.35 μA cm−2 for 20 min, with a Pt plate as the counter electrode in a 0.03 M EDA aqueous electrolyte at 80 °C, and the sample was then washed with deionized water.


2.2.2 Synthesis of ZnO@ZIF-8 arrays. 
The FTO-coated glass substrate with ZnO NTs was placed in a Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave (50 mL) in which 0.1 g of 2-mIm was dissolved in a 16 mL mixed solvent of DMF/H2O with a volume ratio of 3:1. The mixture was heated in an oven at 80 °C for 24 h, and then cooled to room temperature under airflow. The ZnO@ZIF-8 arrays were obtained and washed with ethanol.


2.2.3 Synthesis of 3D network structured ZnO@Ni/Co-LDH. 
The FTO-coated glass substrate with ZnO@ZIF-8 arrays was placed in a Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave (50 mL) in which Ni(NO3)2·6H2O and Co(NO3)2·6H2O were dissolved in a 36 mL mixed solvent of DMF/H2O with a volume ratio of 1:1. The mixture was heated in an oven at 80 °C for 24 h, and then cooled to room temperature under airflow. The obtained ZnO@Ni/Co-LDH film on the FTO-coated glass substrate was washed with deionized water and ethanol, respectively and dried at room temperature for 6 h. The active components and active sites of ZnO@Ni/Co-LDH films were optimized by controlling the added amount of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O and Co(NO3)2·6H2O; molar ratios of 0 mmol:0.136 mmol (0:4), 0.034 mmol:0.102 mmol (1:3), 0.068 mmol:0.068 mmol (2:2), 0.102 mmol:0.034 mmol (3:1), and 0.136 mmol:0 mmol (4:0) were used, and the corresponding ZnO@Ni/Co-LDH films were denoted as LDH-1, LDH-2, LDH-3, LDH-4 and LDH-5, respectively. ZnO NR@Ni/Co-LDH with ZnO NRs as the template was also prepared for comparison using the same procedure without the electro-etching process.

2.3 Solid-state device assembly

2.3.1 Preparation of 1 M KOH/PVA gel electrolyte. 
2.5 g PVA was dissolved in 20 mL deionized water by continuous stirring at 95 °C for 3 h until a clear viscous solution was obtained. When it was cooled down to room temperature, 5 mL of 5 M KOH solution was slowly added into the viscous solution.


2.3.2 Assembly of the solid-state device. 
The solid-state device was assembled by using two LDH-3 films as EC layers on both sides of the device. The ion storage layer in the middle of the two EC layers was prepared by coating the well-mixed slurry (made up of AC, ACET conductive agent and PVDF binder in a weight ratio of 7:2:1 in NMP with an active mass loading of ∼1.0 mg cm−2) onto a CC current collector, and dried at 80 °C for 6 h in a vacuum oven. Clear double-sided tape (3 M, VHB 4010) was used as the spacer, and the electrolyte of 1 M KOH/PVA was injected into the device through the tape. Finally, the solid-state device with a solid electrolyte was obtained by drying the device at 40 °C for 5 h.

2.4 EC and electrochemical measurements
Electrochemical measurements including cyclic voltammetry (CV), chronoamperometric (CA) and galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD) were carried out in a three-electrode electrochemical workstation (Chenhua CHI760E) with ZnO@Ni/Co-LDH films as the working electrode, Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode, and platinum foil as the counter electrode, and 1 M KOH aqueous solution was used as the electrolyte. In situ EC performance of the ZnO@Ni/Co-LDH films was studied together with the electrochemical measurements using an Ocean Optics fiber-optic setup. Transmission spectra of the ZnO@Ni/Co-LDH films in the wavelength range of 350 to 1000 nm in the pristine, colored and bleached states were recorded. A vessel containing only the electrolyte was employed to obtain the 100% level for the transmittance of the films, while air was used to obtain the 100% level for the transmittance of the device. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) tests were conducted in the frequency range of 0.01 Hz to 100 kHz. The mass densities of the active materials loaded on the FTO-coated glass substrates were 0.097–0.010 mg cm−2.
The switching time is defined as the time required to reach 90% change between the bleached state and the colored state. The coloration efficiency is defined as:30,31 (1)where ΔOD is the optical density, ΔQ is the inserted charge, and Tb and Tc denote the transmittance of the film in the bleached and colored states at the specified wavelength, respectively. Areal capacity and gravimetric capacity of the films were calculated from the GCD curves using:32,33 (2) (3)where Ca (mC cm−2) is the areal capacity, Cm (C g−1) is the gravimetric capacity, I (A) is the discharge current, ΔV (V) is the discharge voltage range exclusive of the IR drop, a (cm2) is the area of the electrode and m (g) is the mass of the active material (the mass of the FTO-coated glass substrate is not included).
Energy density and power density of the device were calculated by using:34,35 (4) (5)where C (mF cm−2) is the areal capacity of the device, ΔV (V) is the discharge voltage range exclusive of the IR drop, and Δt (s) is the discharge time.
2.5 Characterization
The crystalline structure of ZnO, ZnO@ZIF-8 and ZnO@Ni/Co-LDH films was investigated together with FTO-coated glass substrates by X-ray diffraction (XRD) (SMARTLAB 3 kW) with Cu-Kα-radiation (λ = 1.542 Å). The morphology of them was observed by using a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) (ZEISS Sigma 300, Hitachi SU8220) at 10 kV accelerating voltage. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (FEI TF20, 2100 Plus) was performed at 200 kV accelerating voltage to obtain the genuine microstructural information. Energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS) was performed in the scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) mode by using a Super-X system (Bruker) with four silicon drift detectors. STEM images were taken with a HAADF detector 3000 (Fishione). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (XPS/INA-X) was carried out with monochromatic Al Kα irradiation (1486.6 eV, beam size is 100 μm in diameter). Raman and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) were performed using confocal Raman spectroscopy with a 532 nm laser line (Nicolet iS 50) and a GX FTIR spectrometer (LabRAM HR Evolution), respectively. Gas-adsorption measurements were conducted on a Micromeritics 2460 at 77 K. The specific surface area and pore volume were analyzed through Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) analysis method using N2 gas and Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) analysis method, respectively.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Characterization of the ZnO@Ni/Co-LDH film

Fig. 1b shows a schematic diagram of the fabrication process for 3D network structured ZnO@Ni/Co-LDH, as further illustrated in the Experimental section. Hexagonal prism-shaped ZnO NRs have been synthesized on the FTO-coated glass substrates ((i) in Fig. 1b and c), and then etched to ZnO NTs with a regular hexagonal hollow prism structure. Potential profiles during the electrochemical processes are presented in Fig. S1, ESI.† The outer diameter and wall thickness of the obtained ZnO NTs were ∼237 nm and 63 nm, respectively ((ii) in Fig. 1b and c). Core–shell ZnO@ZIF-8 arrays were then prepared using ZnO NTs as the sacrificial templates by adding the organic ligand 2-mIm ((iii) in Fig. 1b and c), providing structural support for MOF-derived ZnO@Ni/Co-LDH with a high specific surface area and rich reaction active sites. Detailed characterization and analysis of ZnO and ZnO@ZIF-8 are discussed in the ESI (Fig. S2–S4†).
3D network structured ZnO@Ni/Co-LDH ((iv) in Fig. 1b, c and 2a) was finally obtained from the core–shell ZnO@ZIF-8 arrays by chemical etching. The reaction can be expressed as:36,37 Co2+ + H2O → Co(OH)2 + H+(6) Ni2+ + H2O → Ni(OH)2 + H+(7) [Zn(mim)2−p(Hmim)q]p+ + (2 − p)H+ → Zn2+ + (2 − p + q)Hmim(8) Zn2+ + xCo2+ + yNi2+ + zH2O → ZnCoxNiy(OH)z + zH+(9) Co2+ + mNi2+ + nH2O → CoNim(OH)n + nH+(10)

(g) Nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms (inset represents the corresponding pore size distribution) of the ZnO@Ni/Co-LDH powder scraped from the FTO-coated glass substrate. 
Five ZnO@Ni/Co-LDH films with varied added amounts of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O and Co(NO3)2·6H2O were prepared, and were denoted as LDH-1, LDH-2, LDH-3, LDH-4 and LDH-5, respectively (see details in the Experimental section). The morphology of them was porous, as shown in Fig. S5.† Here, LDH-3 was taken as the example, since it showed the best energy storage and EC performance, which will be discussed in detail in the following sections. It exhibited a forest-like morphology (Fig. 2a) with a thickness of 720 nm (inset of Fig. 2b). The diameter of the ZnO@Ni/Co-LDH simulating porous tree trunk structure was ∼220 nm and wall thickness of the nanotube is ∼50 nm. Support of the cavity structure benefited the transport of ions and electrons, extended nanosheets outside the nanotubes (Fig. 2c) provided a large number of active sites for the electrochemical reaction, and the space between adjacent nanotubes facilitated electrolyte penetration and ion diffusion (Fig. 2b). In addition, the core–shell heterostructure was characterized by high-resolution TEM. The interplanar spacing of 0.26 nm and 0.20 nm corresponded to (012) and (018) planes of Ni/Co-LDH, respectively (inset of Fig. 2d), and Zn, Co, Ni, and O elements were distributed in all areas of ZnO@Ni/Co-LDH (Fig. 2e). It should be mentioned that Zn was detected also on the extended nanosheets outside the nanotubes due to the formation of Zn2+ according to eqn (8), although the amount was quite small. The XRD pattern of the ZnO@Ni/Co-LDH film exhibited diffraction peaks assigned to FTO (JCPDS no. 41-1445), ZnO (JCPDS no. 36-1451), and Ni/Co-LDH (JCPDS no. 40-0216) at 11.7°, 23.6°, 35.7°, 38.9° and 59.8° corresponding to (003), (006), (012), (015) and (110) planes,36–39 respectively (Fig. 2f). In order to show the diffraction peaks of Ni/Co-LDH more clearly, we also measured the XRD pattern of the ZnO@Ni/Co-LDH powder by scraping the film off the FTO-coated glass substrate (Fig. S6a†). The positions of the peaks appeared were in coincidence with those in Fig. 2f. Characteristic diffraction peaks of ZIF-8 disappeared, indicating that ZnO@ZIF-8 was completely etched to ZnO@Ni/Co-LDH, which was in agreement with the change in the interplanar spacing shown in Fig. 2d and S3d.†
Raman and FTIR spectra of the ZnO@Ni/Co-LDH film were also recorded to verify the formation of ZnO@Ni/Co-LDH (Fig. S6b and c†). The observed prominent Raman peaks at 681 cm−1, 618 cm−1, 515 cm−1 and 473 cm−1 corresponded to characteristic active modes of A1g, F2g(1), F2g(2) and Eg, respectively.40,41 Peaks at 473 cm−1 and 515 cm−1 can be assigned to the stretching modes of M–OH and M–O, respectively, where M denotes Ni, Co and Zn, and the peak located at 437 cm−1 was the characteristic peak of ZnO.40 The FTIR spectrum showed a broad absorbance peak between 3500 cm−1 and 3100 cm−1, which might be ascribed to O–H stretching vibrations, and the peak at 1620 cm−1 corresponded to O–H bending vibrations. Peaks at 2913 cm−1 and 2842 cm−1 can be attributed to C–H stretching modes, and the peak at 1331 cm−1 was due to C–H bending modes. CO stretching and bending vibrations emerged at 1650 cm−1 and 1039 cm−1, and the M–OH vibration yielded a peak at 672 cm−1.42–44
The specific surface area and pore structure of electrode materials are two essential parameters affecting EC and energy storage performance. The nitrogen isotherm of the ZnO@Ni/Co-LDH powder (Fig. 2g) showed obvious hysteresis over the relative pressure range of 0.8 to 1.0 (mmHg mmHg−1). The BET surface area was 606.5 m2 g−1, much larger than that of ZnO NR@Ni/Co-LDH (408.0 m2 g−1 in Fig. S7†). The average pore size calculated by the BJH method from desorption data was 15.7 nm, and the pore size distribution is presented in the inset of Fig. 2g. The data indicate that ZnO@Ni/Co-LDH consisted of both mesopores and macropores, and the former one dominates. Such an inherent highly porous structure and large specific surface area will strongly promote the electrochemical redox reaction of ZnO@Ni/Co-LDH via facilitating transport and intercalation/deintercalation of ions and electrons to effectively improve its EC and energy storage performance.
3.2 Electrochemical properties and energy storage performance
Before electrochemical measurements, the ZnO@Ni/Co-LDH films were immersed in an aqueous 1 M KOH electrolyte for activation, and hexagonal wurtzite ZnO was totally transformed into new ZnO (JCPDS no. 21-1486), as shown in Fig. S6d.† It was found that ZnO was responsible for the enhanced capture ability of OH− and high transparency of the films under alkaline conditions,45,46 leading to the improved energy storage and EC performance of the ZnO@Ni/Co-LDH films.
In order to investigate the effect of Ni/Co contents on the electrochemical properties of ZnO@Ni/Co-LDH films, CV and GCD processes were performed in an aqueous 1 M KOH electrolyte, as shown in Fig. 3a and b. All the five ZnO@Ni/Co-LDH films exhibited battery-type charge storage behavior with a pair of redox peaks during the CV cycle.47,48 Specially, LDH-3 showed a higher peak current density, a larger area enclosed by the CV curve and a longer charging/discharging time. Areal capacities at various current densities were calculated from the GCD curves, as depicted in Fig. 3c. Areal capacities of the five ZnO@Ni/Co-LDH films were 13.2, 30.0, 49.7, 45.1 and 6.6 mC cm−2 at a current density of 0.1 mA cm−2, and LDH-3 exhibited the largest value. Therefore, the electrochemical properties of LDH-3 were further studied. Pairs of symmetrical redox peaks can be observed from the CV curves of LDH-3 at various scan rates (Fig. 3d), indicating its good reversibility. The shift of the redox peaks with the increasing scan rates can be assigned to the hysteresis in the charge transfer due to diffusion polarization, chemical polarization and ohmic polarization.49 The reduction peaks can be attributed to the transition of CoOOH and NiOOH to Co(OH)2 and Ni(OH)2, and the oxidation peaks represented the reverse process.50,51

It should be mentioned that the ZnO@Ni/Co-LDH film will exhibit battery-type charge storage behavior due to the reversible transition between NiOOH and Ni(OH)2.52 In general, charge storage consists of surface capacitive-controlled (originating from ion adsorption/desorption) and diffusion-controlled (caused by faradaic redox reactions) contributions.53 The power-law rule was used to shed light on the charge storage behavior of ZnO@Ni/Co-LDH by using:54 i = avb(11) log(i) = log(a) + blog(v)(12)where a and b are adjustable parameters and ν represents the applied scan rate. The expected value of b between 0.5 and 1.0 can be calculated from the slope of the log(i) versus log(ν) plot. Charge storage is mainly surface capacitive-controlled when b is ∼1.0, while diffusion-controlled dominates when b is ∼0.5.55,56 The values of b of LDH-3 during the oxidation and reduction were 0.82 and 0.81, respectively (Fig. 3e), indicating the mixed charge storage behavior, and the surface-controlled kinetic mechanism dominated. This can also be verified by the perfect linear relationship (R2 = 0.99) between the peak current density and scan rate (Fig. 3f). The proportion of charge stored by the capacitive (k1v) and diffusion (k2v1/2) contribution mechanisms were further calculated by using:57,58 i = icap + idiff = k1v + k2v1/2(13) (14)where i, v, and k1 and k2 represent the current density, scan rate and constants, respectively. The ratios of capacitive-controlled charge storage were 70%, 73%, 77% and 88% at the scan rates of 2 mV s−1, 5 mV s−1, 10 mV s−1, and 20 mV s−1, respectively (Fig. 3g), suggesting that the capacitive contribution dominated, which was consistent with the results calculated by using eqn (13) and (14). Capacitive storage features fast reaction kinetics with rapid ion intercalation/deintercalation, and can achieve excellent cycling stability.59 LDH-3 exhibited the potential of fast response and long-term durability, as is evident from the increased ratio of the surface capacitive-controlled charge storage with the increase of the scan rate, including a large scan rate of 20 mV s−1. The other capacity associated with the battery-type mechanism can contribute to the increased charge storage of LDH-3.60 GCD curves in Fig. 3h show a very symmetric nature, indicating again that LDH-3 exhibits a good capacitive characteristic and reversible redox reaction.
It is noted that LDH-3 presented an impressive charge capacity of 507.2 C g−1 on the one-dimensional FTO-coated glass substrate with much lower electrical conductivity (Fig. 3i). Its energy storage performance is better than those on other one-dimensional conductive substrates (Table S1†). The specific capacity of LDH-3 was quite high at all the current densities, and a reversible capacity of 393.5 C g−1 can be maintained at an ultrahigh current density of 1.6 mA cm−2, with 77.6% capacity retention relative to the capacity at 0.1 mA cm−2, indicating a high rate capability. The excellent energy storage performance was due to the combined effect of the large specific surface area of the highly porous 3D network structure and the improved electrochemical activity by Ni/Co incorporation. The electrochemical properties and energy storage performance of the other four LDHs and ZnO NR@Ni/Co-LDH are displayed in Fig. S8–S13.† All LDHs can retain more than 75% charge capacity at various current densities (Fig. S12f†).
3.3 EC performance and the coloration mechanism
Electrochromism is intimately connected with charge intercalation/deintercalation, which can be mirrored by optical transmittance modulation of the electrode material. Therefore, in situ transmittance of the ZnO@Ni/Co-LDH films was recorded during electrochemical processes in the wavelength range of 350–1000 nm. Fig. 4a shows the transmittance variation of LDH-3 at a mid-luminous wavelength of 550 nm (most sensitive to human eyes) during CV cycling in the potential range of 0 V to 0.5 V. The pristine LDH-3 film was transparent; it can be converted to dark brown with the increase of the potential, resulting in a transmittance of 18% at 550 nm and at 0.5 V. During the scan from 0.5 V to 0 V, the film was bleached to light yellow color to achieve a transmittance of 74%, exhibiting anodic coloration with a large transmittance modulation (ΔT) of 56%. The highly reversible color change can also be realized during the charging/discharging process, as shown in Fig. 4b. In order to describe the relationship between energy storage and EC performance more clearly, transmittance variation with the specific capacity during charge/discharge was plotted (Fig. 4c). Expectedly, the transmittance of LDH-3 decreased continuously during the charging process, achieving the lowest value of 18% after full charge with a specific capacity of 507.2 C g−1. In contrast, the film gradually recovered the bleached-state transmittance during discharge. The well-overlapped charge/discharge curves indicate excellent EC reversibility of LDH-3, which is in line with the above results.

(a) CV curve and the corresponding in situ transmittance at 550 nm at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 in the potential range of 0 V to 0.5 V. (b) GCD curve at a current density of 0.1 mA cm−2 and the corresponding in situ transmittance at 550 nm.

(d) Transmittance of the film in the pristine, colored and bleached states in the wavelength range of 350–1000 nm. (e) In situ transmittance variation at 550 nm during CA cycling by applying a pulsed potential of 0 V and 0.5 V for 20 s each. (f) Switching time and ΔT of five ZnO@Ni/Co-LDH films.

EC performance was further studied by the CA cycling by applying a pulsed potential of 0 V and 0.5 V for 20 s each. The transmittance of LDH-3 in the pristine, colored and bleached states in the wavelength range of 350–1000 nm and the corresponding photos are displayed in Fig. 4d. This showed a very fast response with a coloration time of 0.7 s and bleaching time of 2.7 s (Fig. 4e). It is noted that the incorporation of Co can surprisingly shorten the switching time of the film (Fig. 4f). As discussed above, the increased ratio of Co leads to the dominant capacitive-type contribution to facilitate ion intercalation/deintercalation.
XPS was used to determine elemental compositions for surfaces of LDH-3 to document differences in its pristine, colored and bleached states. Fig. 4g–i shows high-resolution XPS spectra pertaining to Ni 2p3/2, Co 2p3/2, and O 1s in the pristine, colored and bleached states of LDH-3. The characteristic binding energy of C at 284.8 eV was used for internal energy calibration. Ni 2p3/2 spectra can be deconvoluted into contributions from Ni2+ at 855.1 eV and Ni3+ at 856.5 eV,46,61,62 while the binding energies of Co2+ and Co3+ were at 782.1 eV and 780.5 eV.27,44,63 All of Ni2+, Ni3+, Co2+ and Co3+ were found in the pristine LDH-3 film, with a 50%/50% ratio of Ni2+/Ni3+ and 65%/35% ratio of Co2+/Co3+. However, the concentrations of Ni3+ and Co3+ increased in the colored film at 0.5 V, resulting in a 24%/76% ratio of Ni2+/Ni3+ and 14%/86% ratio of Co2+/Co3+, and the intercalation of OH− and concurrent deintercalation of electrons led to increased p-doping with a Fermi level shift to the valence band during the coloring/charging process to achieve color.64 When a reversing potential of 0 V was applied, Ni2+/Ni3+ and Co2+/Co3+ ratios changed to 70%/30% and 71%/29%, respectively.
Deintercalation of OH− and concurrent intercalation of electrons shifted the Fermi level to the conduction band to bleach the film during discharge. Besides, the O 1s signal from the pristine LDH-3 film was mainly due to the adsorbed water and OH− on the surface with characteristic binding energies of 532.5 eV and 530.9 eV, respectively. The peak located at 529.1 eV in the colored film was due to O2− in M–OOH, and it disappeared in the bleached film. In addition, the reduced crystallinity of ZnO (Fig. S6d†) was in favor of the adsorption of OH− on the surface of the ZnO@Ni/Co-LDH film. Thus, the reversible redox reaction of the ZnO@Ni/Co-LDH films during the EC energy storage process can be written as: Ni(OH)2 + OH− ↔ NiOOH + H2O + e−(15) Co(OH)2 + OH− ↔ CoOOH + H2O + e−(16)(bleached/discharged) (colored/charged).
Most EC devices and supercapacitors must be durable for extended periods of time, and there has remained an urgent need for this. It was found that LDH-3 retained 72.1% of the initial capacity after 10000 GCD cycles at an ultrahigh current density of 1.6 mA cm−2, and the coulombic efficiency maintained a high value of 99.0% during the process (Fig. 5a). Transmittance at 550 nm was measured together with GCD cycling (Fig. 5b). Transmittance modulation was 104.6% and 81.0% of the initial value after 5000 and 10000 GCD cycles, respectively. The data provide clear evidence of the superior durability for both energy storage and optical variation. It is particularly interesting to note that the nanotube structure was revealed but was not deformed after long-term cycling (insets of Fig. 5b), which was responsible for the superior durability by providing a stable structural foundation.

(d) The circuit model used to fit the Nyquist plots in (c). 
The long-term GCD cycling process was also studied by EIS, as shown in Fig. 5c. The shape of the impedance response showed a semicircle with a tail on its right side. The circuit model used (Fig. 5d) in the impedance results was fitted well. Since the ZnO@Ni/Co-LDH film consisted of Ni/Co-LDH simulating leaves and ZnO@Ni/Co-LDH simulating tree trunks, R1 and R2 represent the charge transfer resistance in Ni/Co-LDH and ZnO@Ni/Co-LDH layers, respectively, and CPE1 and CPE2 correspond to the double-layer capacity at the indicated interfaces shown in Fig. 5d. Rs is the high frequency resistance representing the electrolyte and ZW is the diffusion (Warburg) element inside the ZnO@Ni/Co-LDH layer. R1 and R2 of LDH-3 were 2.0 Ω and 12.7 Ω in the initial state, and increased to 16.6 Ω and 168.0 Ω after 10000 GCD cycles due to the decreased crystallinity of Ni/Co-LDH (Fig. S20†), and the slope of the simulated line in the low-frequency range decreased slightly. The results imply that long-term cycling may lead to an increased charge transfer resistance and a slower diffusion rate inside the film. EC performance of the other four LDHs and ZnO NR@Ni/Co-LDH is displayed in Fig. S14–S19.†
The EC supercapacitor using ZnO@Ni/Co-LDH films as the EC energy storage layers was further constructed to evaluate its EC energy storage performance after careful selection of the anode and electrolyte to match each other. Fig. 6a shows the schematic diagram of the entire arrangement and the EC energy storage mechanism of the device. The OH− ions from the electrolyte moved towards and intercalated into ZnO@Ni/Co-LDH cathodes on both sides. Ni2+ and Co2+ were oxidized to Ni3+ and Co3+ during the charging process, and the color of the device turned dark brown. In the reverse process, the intercalated OH− ions moved out of the ZnO@Ni/Co-LDH cathodes and were stored on the surface of the carbon anode, and Ni2+ and Co2+ were re-generated during the discharging process to bleach the device to light yellow (Fig. 6b and Movie S1†). The color switch of the device was the same as that of the ZnO@Ni/Co-LDH film. Therefore, the color of the device can be varied according to its charging/discharging state, and the level of the energy contained can be accurately assessed and predicted by the naked eye.

Photographs of the device (j) in its colored state charged by using a PV solar panel and (k) in its bleached state discharged by using a PV solar panel. 
The EC energy storage performance of the ZnO@Ni/Co-LDH device was also investigated. Transmittance modulation of the device was monitored in the wavelength range of 350–1000 nm during CA cycling by applying a pulsed potential of −0.8 V and 2.0 V for 20 s each (Fig. 6c). This showed an obvious change in the entire visible wavelength range and the largest value of 63% at 660 nm with a transmittance of 85% and 22% in the bleached and colored states, respectively. In addition, the switching speed of the device was quite fast, and only 5.8 s and 4.7 s were required for the coloration and bleaching processes (Fig. 6d), and the coloration efficiency was 44.2 cm2 C−1 (Fig. 6e). Cycling durability was also tested to evaluate the practical application value of the device. The transmittance modulation remained almost unchanged during the 1000 CA cycles (Fig. 6f), and retained 93.5% capacity after 1500 GCD cycles at an ultrahigh current density of 2.0 mA cm−2 (Fig. S21†). As shown in the inset of Fig. 6h calculated from Fig. 6g, the specific capacitance was as high as 24.6 mF cm−2 at 0.5 mA cm−2, and retained 56.0% of the value at 8.0 mA cm−2 (the mass specific capacitance in the unit of F g−1 was 128.1 F g−1 at 2.6 A g−1, as shown in Fig. S22a†), thus demonstrating good rate capability, excellent reversibility and energy storage performance of the EC supercapacitor device. It is clearly seen from the Ragone plot that the energy density and power density of the device were 7.7 μW h cm−2 and 375.0 μW cm−2, respectively. Moreover, the energy density still retained 4.3 μW h cm−2 even at a high power density of 6000.0 μW cm−2, exhibiting much better energy storage performance than that of the hybrid supercapacitors consisting of Ni/Co-based metal oxides,65,66 metal sulfides67,68 and metal hydroxides61 (Fig. S22b†). Table S2† summarizes the key EC energy storage performance of the ZnO@Ni/Co-LDH-based EC supercapacitor device in this work and other state-of-the-art bi-functional EC supercapacitor platforms. The data highlight the superiority of the ZnO@Ni/Co-LDH device with large transmittance modulation, fast switching speed, outstanding electrochemical and optical durability, and high energy density and power density. Thus, the ZnO@Ni/Co-LDH device is the most competitive one among all the previously reported bi-functional EC supercapacitor devices.
In order to illustrate the low energy consuming application of the ZnO@Ni/Co-LDH device, a commercial PV solar panel (0.65 W at AM 1.5 spectrum) was connected with the device under ambient solar irradiation to realize energy conservation and environmental protection by solar energy collection and charge storage. Fig. 6i displays the charging and discharging processes by the PV solar panel and galvanostatic measurement. The device can be colored thoroughly by using a PV solar panel (Fig. 6j and Movies S2†) within 25 s with a transmittance modulation of 59.0% at 660 nm, and it can be bleached either by a discharging process or just by reversing the polarity (Fig. 6k) to realize the automatic dynamic dimming for effective utilization of energy.
4. Conclusions
In conclusion, we demonstrated a high-performance battery-type bi-functional EC supercapacitor composed of non-noble metal-based ZnO@Ni/Co-LDH. The unique forest geotexture-inspired 3D network structure offers diverse porous structures with an ultrahigh specific surface area and rich exposed active sites. ZnO NT “trunks” and Ni/Co-LDH “leaves” are responsible for the enhanced OH− capture ability and electrochemical activity, respectively. The mixed charge storage behavior ensures fast ion intercalation/deintercalation, excellent durability and charge storage. Among the five ZnO@Ni/Co-LDH films, LDH-3 exhibits remarkable EC and energy storage performance with a transmittance modulation of 56% at 550 nm, switching time of 0.7 s and 2.7 s for coloration and bleaching processes, charge capacity of 507.2 C g−1 at 0.1 mA cm−2, 72.1% capacity retention and 81.0% transmittance modulation retention after 10000 GCD cycles. The device based on LDH-3 is also fabricated and investigated. Impressive optical and electrochemical durability, large transmittance modulation (63% at 660 nm), fast switching speed (5.8 s for coloration and 4.7 s for bleaching), outstanding durability (98.6% transmittance modulation retention after 1000 cycles), high energy density (7.7 μW h cm−2) and power density (375.0 μW cm−2) are displayed. These are comparable with those of the single-functional EC or supercapacitor devices. The bi-functional device is further integrated into a solar energy system to realize the collection and storage of renewable energy and automatic switching of optical properties of the device. The low-cost and environment friendly ZnO@Ni/Co-LDH presented here is applicable to buildings and vehicles and should be interesting for the development of LDH materials in opto-electronic applications.
