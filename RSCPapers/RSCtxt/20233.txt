, Accepted 4th September 2014First published on 4th September 2014AbstractIn this article, TiO2 has been successfully fa in the Ti(SO4)2–CH3COOH system via a simple hydrothermal method. The formation mechanism of the TiO2 hierarchical nanostructures was also investigated in detail, which involved the complex reaction between Ti(SO4)2 and CH3COOH, hydrolysis of the complex, nucleation and self-assembly of TiO2 nanocrystals and anisotropic growth of these subunits. SO42− plays an important role in the self-assembly of subunits. In addition, controllable synthesis of TiO2 hierarchical nanostructures with tunable size can be realized just by changing experimental parameters, such as reaction time or Ti(SO4)2 concentration. When used as the anode in lithium ion batteries, these TiO2 hierarchical nanostructures present much higher specific capacity and better rate performances than TiO2 nanoparticles, which are attributed to the stability of the secondary-structure during the charge and discharge processes.
Introduction
Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), as a major break-through in electrochemical energy conversion and storage devices, have been extensively used as the power sources for popular mobile devices.1–3 They are considered to be promising choices of power system for the next generation of electric vehicles because of their high energy density, no memory effect, low maintenance, and little self-discharge.4,5 In principle, the lithium ion storage capabilities of electrode materials are strongly depended on the diffusion distance of Li+, electrical conductivity, particle size, morphology and architecture.6–10 Nanostructured electrode materials can shorten diffusion paths for both electronic and ionic transport and have large electrode/electrolyte contact area. Therefore, nano-sized electrode materials always exhibit excellent electrochemical performances and have received much attention.11–14 However, these active nanomaterials also accompany some disadvantages, such as the decreasing of volumetric density and increasing of undesirable surface reactions when used as electrode materials.11 In addition, the aggregation of nanoparticles during charge and discharge processes always leads to the poor cycling performance.15 Therefore, it still remains a great challenge to develop new synthetic strategies to fabricate electrode materials with high-performance.
Recently, hierarchically nanostructured electrode materials have attracted much interest due to their novel physicochemical properties and excellent electrochemical performances. For instance, hierarchically porous Li4Ti5O12 microspheres show an ultrahigh capability and excellent capacity retention over 200 cycles at high rates.16 TiO2 nanosheets hierarchical spheres manifest an unusually high Coulombic efficiency for lithium extraction, excellent capacity retention, and superior rate behavior.17 However, hierarchical flower-like SnO2 structure also shows a very high reversible capacity and good rate performance.18 Hierarchical architectures can take advantage of both the nano-size effects and the high stability of the secondary-structure assemblies, thus have great potential applications in LIBs.19–21
Titanium dioxide (TiO2), as an important functional metal, has been extensively studied in widely applications like photocatalysis,22,23 gas sensing,24 dye sensitized solar cells.25,26 Due to the low-cost, excellent chemical stability and good rate performance, TiO2 is also demonstrated as a promising anode material for LIBs.27,28 Moreover, TiO2 exhibits excellent Li-ion insertion/extraction reversibility with negligible structural change and a relative higher operating voltage (1.78 V vs. Li/Li+), avoiding the trouble of lithium dendrites, leading to the better safety of battery.29–31
So far, many methods including template and template-free approaches have been widely employed to construct hierarchical TiO2 nanostructures.32–35 Wang et al. successfully synthesized three-dimensional (3D) TiO2 hierarchical nanostructures through a facile hydrothermal and after-annealing process.32 Zhang et al. employ template-assisted hydrothermal methods to prepare hollow hierarchical TiO2 microspheres with superior high-rate and high-capacity performance.33 Even so, it is still relatively hard to realize controllable synthesis of TiO2 hierarchical nanostructures owing to the rapid hydrolysis rate of Ti-containing precursors.
Herein, we report a new and facile synthetic strategy to fabricate TiO2 hierarchical nanostructures with tunable size and morphology in the titanium sulfate–acetic acid reaction system just by changing experimental parameters, such as reaction time and Ti(SO4)2 concentration. The growth mechanism of TiO2 hierarchical structures was also investigated in detail, which involved an assembly and anisotropic growth process. In addition, TiO2 hierarchical structures exhibited much higher reversible specific capacities and better rate performances than TiO2 nanoparticles when used as anode material in LIBs.
Experimental
Synthesis of TiO2 hierarchical nanostructures (THNs)
All the reagents were purchased from Shanghai Chemical Reagent Co. and used without further purification. The preparation of TiO2 hierarchical nanostructures were performed in the Ti(SO4)2–CH3COOH system via a simply hydrothermal method.
In a typical synthesis, 15 mL of Ti(SO4)2 aqueous solution (0.33 M) was dropwise added into 40 mL of CH3COOH solution under vigorously stirring, forming milky suspension immediately. After further stirring for 1 hour at room temperature, the obtained suspension was transferred into 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclaves. The vessel was then sealed, heated up to 200 °C and maintained for 24 h. After cooling down to room temperature naturally, the white precipitates were harvested by centrifugation, washed thoroughly with DI water and ethanol for several times. The TiO2 hierarchical nanostructures were finally achieved after drying at 80 °C overnight.
In order to investigate the growth mechanism as well as the effects of Ti(SO4)2 concentration, hydrothermal temperature and reactant species on the morphology of TiO2 hierarchical nanostructures, some contrast experiments were carried out under series of corresponding parameters and keeping other experimental conditions constant. The samples obtained at 1 h, 4 h, 8 h, 24 h were denoted as S-1, S-4, S-8 and S-24.
Characterization
The general morphology of as-prepared products was observed by field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM; Hitachi S4800 microscope, 5 kV). The more detailed structures were observed by transmission electron microscope (TEM; JEM-1230 microscope, 80 kV) and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM; Tecnai G2 F20 microscope, 200 kV). The crystal phase of products was performed by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD; Philips PW1050 diffractometer, Cu Kα radiation). The crystallite sizes were calculated by using the Scherrer equation based on the (101) peak.
Electrochemical measurement
The electrode was prepared by mixing active materials (80 wt%), acetylene black (10 wt%), and polyvinylidene fluoride (10 wt% PVDF) in N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP) to form a homogenous slurry. Afterwards, the slurry was uniformly spread onto copper foils and dried under vacuum at 120 °C overnight. The coin cells (CR2025-type) were assembled in an argon-filled glovebox with both moisture and oxygen contents below 1 ppm. Li foil was used as the counter electrode, 1 M LiPF6 in a mixture of ethylene carbonate (EC), dimethyl carbonate (DMC) and ethyl methylcarbonate (EMC) (1:1:1 by volume) was used as the electrolyte and Celgard 2400 as the separator. The cycling and rate performances of these cells were evaluated by a LAND CT2001A battery test system. All the tests were conducted at room temperature. For comparison, the electrode of TiO2 nanoparticles was also tested using the same preparation procedures.
Results and discussion
TiO2 hierarchical nanostructures were obtained by a simple hydrothermal treatment of the Ti(SO4)2–CH3COOH solution. The general morphology of as-prepared products was investigated by FESEM and the resulting SEM images with different magnifications are displayed in Fig. 1(a and b). A panoramic view reveals that homogeneously dispersed spherical products with diameters around 350 nm are successfully synthesized in the present reaction conditions. The magnified SEM image in Fig. 1(b) clearly demonstrates these spherical particles are constructed by a lot of tiny primary nanosubunits with sizes about 20 nm, implying that the products are hierarchical nanostructures. The spherical morphology and hierarchical structures of products can be further convinced by TEM and the corresponding TEM image is displayed in Fig. 1(c). The shape of nanosubunits is approximate to square block with size about 20 nm, and the outline of nanosubunits is marked out by red solid line, as shown in Fig. 1(c). Moreover, it is obvious to see that crystallographic orientation of these primary nanoparticles is different, indicating these hierarchical products are polycrystalline. The diffuse diffraction ring pattern from the whole spherical particle also confirms this result. HRTEM was performed to analyze the detailed structure of nanosubunits and the results are shown in Fig. 1(d). The observed lattice fringes with an interspacing of 0.35 nm can be indexed to the (101) plane of anatase TiO2.

Fig. 2 shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of TiO2 hierarchical nanostructures. All the diffraction peaks are well indexed to a pure tetragonal structure of anatase (JCPDS no. 21-1272, space group: I41/amd, a = b = 3.785 Å, c = 9.514 Å). No characteristic peaks of other impurities are observed, which indicates the high purity of as-prepared products. In addition, the average crystallite sizes of TiO2 hierarchical structures are estimated by Scherrer formula to be about 20 nm, which is consistent with that measured from TEM images shown in Fig. 1(c).

For investigating the formation process of the TiO2 hierarchical nanostructures, a series of time-dependent experiments was carried out with other experimental parameters constant. Samples obtained at 1 h, 4 h, 8 h, 24 h were named as S-1, S-4, S-8 and S-24, respectively. The morphology evolution and crystalline structure of samples under different reaction times were characterized by SEM and XRD.
When the Ti(SO4)2 aqueous solution was added into CH3COOH solution, white precipitates would be formed immediately. However, these white precipitates would redissolve in the ethanol or water solvent, indicating the formation of organic complex during the reaction between Ti(SO4)2 and CH3COOH. Some ever reported literatures have demonstrated that the reactions between tetrabutyl titanate (TBT) and acetic acid (HAc) would firstly form a six or four coordinated complex, i.e., Ti6O6(Ac)6(OBu)6, Ti(Ac)x(OBu)4−x.36,37 Analogy to TBT, Ti(SO4)2 would react with HAc, forming the Ti(Ac)x(SO4)n−x complex. In order to confirm the above conjecture, the FTIR spectrum of these white precipitates was conducted and the resulted pattern is shown in Fig. S1.† The wavenumbers at 1029, 772 and 672 cm−1 correspond to the bonds of C–C and Ti–O, respectively. The emergence of the asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations of the carboxylic group centered at 1530, 1460, and 1410 cm−1 reveals the coordination of HAc to titanium centers.36 In addition, the white precipitates are amorphous phase and have anomalous chain structures, as Fig. S2† confirmed. With increasing reaction time, Ti–Ac complex would hydrolyze to form TiO2 hierarchical nanostructures under the present reaction condition.
Fig. 3(a) displays the typical SEM image of the product obtained after 1 h. The morphology of sample S-1 is spherical with the average diameter around 350 nm. Additionally, the external surface of spherical particles is rough, indicating that they are consisted of many primary nanoparticles. The average grain size estimated from {101} peak is about 13 nm via Scherrer formula which can also convince this result. When the reaction time increased to 4 h, the surfaces of spherical TiO2 gets much coarser due to the growth of nanocrystals while keeping the diameter of spherical particles nearly unchanged, as shown in Fig. 3(b). In addition, the growth of nanocrystals will produce some stress in the spherical particles. So, with the increase of reaction time, the products will become more loose. As the reaction time further prolonged, the size of subunits will be further increased, which can be seen clearly in Fig. 3(c). When the reaction time is 24 h, well-defined TiO2 hierarchical structures were finally produced.

Fig. 3(e) shows the XRD patterns of samples obtained under different reaction times, such as S-1, S-4, S-8, S-12 and S-24. All the diffraction peaks are well indexed to anatase and the characteristic peaks become much sharper and narrower as the prolongation of reaction time, indicating the enhancement crystallization of products and the growth of subunits. Fig. 3(f) describes curve of average size of subunits vs. reaction time. The average grain sizes under different reaction time were estimated from {101} peak via Scherrer formula. In general, the size of subunits is found to increase with the prolonged reaction time, implying that the size of subunits assembled into hierarchical TiO2 could be tuned just by changing the reaction time.
Based on the experimental results, a possible growth mechanism for TiO2 hierarchical nanostructures is proposed (Scheme 1). When Ti(SO4)2 was added to the solution HAc, a Ti-complex was produced first. As the reaction time increased, the Ti-complex would hydrolyze in the mixture of CH3COOH and H2O, leading to the formation of TiO2 nanocrystals, which would be assembled into spherical TiO2 particles. Finally, the well-defined TiO2 hierarchical nanostructures are achieved for the anisotropic growth of primary nanocrystals.
 Scheme 1  Schematic diagram of the formation processes of TiO2 hierarchical nanosturctures. 
Although the growth process of TiO2 hierarchical nanostructures have been understood clearly, some confusions on the self-assembly process are remained unsolved. Thus, we tried to prepare TiO2 hierarchical nanostructures in other systems, such as TiCl4–CH3COOH, TiCl4–CH3COOH–Na2SO4 and Ti(SO4)2–CH3COOH–NaCl. The obtained products were observed by SEM and the corresponding results were displayed in Fig. 4(a–d). In the TiCl4–CH3COOH system, the products are octahedral particles with length and width of about 500 nm and 200 nm, respectively, which is quite different from the other three systems. However, when Na2SO4 was added into TiCl4–CH3COOH system, i.e., TiCl4–CH3COOH–Na2SO4 system, the formed hierarchical structures are very similar to the ones obtained in Ti(SO4)2–CH3COOH system. Therefore, we can guess that SO42− may play a vital role in the self-assembly process of subunits. In order to exclude the influence of Na+, contrast experiment was conducted in the Ti(SO4)2–CH3COOH–NaCl system and the SEM images of obtained products were shown in Fig. 4(c), which is similar to Fig. 4(d), implying that the introduction of Na+ does not have such great effect on the morphology of hierarchical structures. Therefore, we can conclude that SO42− is the key factor in guiding the self-assembly of nanosubunits for the generation of TiO2 hierarchical structures.

Apart from reaction time, Ti precursor concentration also has profound influence on the TiO2 hierarchical nanostructures. Fig. 5(a–d) show the SEM images of samples obtained under different Ti(SO4)2 concentrations. The histograms of the distribution of the particle diameters under different Ti(SO4)2 concentrations and the corresponding average sizes determined by Gaussian distribution are shown in Fig. 6(a–d). Actually, all the samples display a spherical morphology, indicating that Ti(SO4)2 concentration has no obvious effect on the morphology of products. When the concentration of Ti(SO4)2 was very low (0.17 M), the diameter of final hierarchical spheres is about 200 nm in Fig. 5(a), considerably smaller than that of 0.33 M (350 nm, see Fig. 1). As the concentration increases to 0.24 M or 0.40 M (Fig. 5(b and c)), the diameter increases to 320 nm, which is comparative to that of 0.33 M. However, when the concentration is too high (0.66 M), some monodisperse nanoparticles begin to emerge, which can be see clearly in Fig. 5(d). If the concentration continues to increase, TiO2 nanoparticles can be obtained (see Fig. S3†). These results clearly demonstrate that the increasing Ti sources concentration can effectively change the size of hierarchical TiO2 and choosing an appropriate concentration is very essential for the synthesis of TiO2 hierarchical nanostructures. What's more, it is interesting to find that size of subunits does not change with the difference of Ti(SO4)2 concentration. In general, the size of TiO2 products is found to decrease with the declined concentration of Ti source. When the Ti precursor concentration was low, relatively low amounts of the Ti4+ can take part in the growth around each nucleation site, resulting in TiO2 products with small size. When the Ti precursor concentration was increased, the amount of the Ti4+ available for each nucleation site increased, and hence larger sizes were produced.

Titanium oxide is one of potential anode materials for lithium ion batteries due to its high working voltage (1.78 V vs. Li) and structural stability during lithium insertion/extraction. The principal reaction during lithium insertion/extraction the lattice of TiO2 is presented as follows: 
TiO2 + Li+ + x e− = LixTiO2 (x ≤ 1)
(1)
The theoretical capacity is 335 mA h g−1 for 1 mol Li+ inserting into TiO2 crystal structure. However, the practical capacity is only half of theoretical capacity, corresponding to the insertion coefficient x of 0.5.38 So, 1 C defines as 167.5 mA h g−1.
Fig. 7(a) depicts the charge–discharge voltage profiles of hierarchical TiO2 for the first three cycles at a current rate of 0.2 C (33.5 mA g−1) with a voltage window of 1.0–3.0 V. There are distinct potential plateaus at approximately 1.78 and 1.90 V for the discharge and charge processes, corresponding to the insertion and extraction of Li ions within the anatase lattice, respectively. The discharge curve can be divided into three different voltage regions. In the first region, the voltage sharply decreases to a value of 1.78 V and it is attributed to a solid-solution process.7 The next stage is a voltage plateau, which is maintained by the equilibrium of poor-Li (tetragonal structure) and rich-Li (orthorhombic structure) phases.39 The final stage is the gradual decrease of voltage to 1 V and it is dominated by interfacial storage.40 The first discharge and charge capacities are 387 and 313.8 mA h g−1 and the corresponding coulombic efficiency is about 81.1%. In the second cycle, the discharge capacity decreases to 344 mA h g−1 with a corresponding charge capacity of 305.9 mA h g−1 leading to a higher Coulombic efficiency of 88.9%. After 10 cycles the capacity is retained at 246.8 mA h g−1 and the Coulombic efficiency is up to 100%, demonstrating a good cycling stability (See Fig. 7(d)).

(d) Rate performance of hierarchical TiO2 and TiO2 nanoparticles from 0.2 to 10 C for 10 cycles at each current density. 
Fig. 7(b) shows the cycling performance of hierarchical TiO2 and TiO2 nanoparticles at a current rate of 1 C. The initial discharge capacity is 307.3 and the capacity remains at 170 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles as for hierarchical TiO2. While the capacity is only 75 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles as for TiO2 nanoparticles. It means that the reversible specific capacity of hierarchical TiO2 is double than that of TiO2 nanoparticles at the current rate of 1 C. Even when cycling at high current densities, such as 2 and 5 C, these TiO2 hierarchical nanostructures retain a high capacity and good stability, e.g. the capacity after 50 cycles is still 130 and 110 mA h g−1 at current rates of 2 and 5 C, respectively.
In addition, these two kinds of electrodes were also discharged and charged at various C-rates to evaluate their rate performances. Fig. 7(d) shows the rate capacities of TiO2 hierarchical nanostructures and TiO2 nanoparticles from 0.2 to 10 C for 10 cycles at each current density. After an initial discharge capacity of 387 mA h g−1, the capacity stabilized at 246.8 mA h g−1 at 0.2 C after 10 cycles. After further cycling at 1, 2, 5 and 10 C, the TiO2 hierarchical nanostructures show high reversible capacities of 170.5, 132.9, 112.1 and 96.5 mA h g−1, respectively. When the C rate was switched from 10 to 1 C again, the original capacity was largely recovered, indicating the stability of the electrode materials. However, the TiO2 nanoparticles show rapid capacity decay even though at low current rate, and the reversible capacity is only 60 mA h g−1 at 1 C, showing the poor rate performance. The good electrochemical performances of TiO2 hierarchical nanostructures are much attributed to their high stability of the secondary-structure assemblies, and the SEM images of the hierarchical nanostructures after running 50 cycles give visible evidence that the structure is well-preserved (see Fig. S4†).
Conclusions
In summary, a new facile hydrothermal synthesis was presented to prepare TiO2 hierarchical nanostructures. According to the results of time-dependent experiments, a possible growth mechanism was proposed. The growth processes mainly involve the formation of Ti–Ac complex, hydrolysis–polymerization of complex, nucleation and self-assembly of TiO2 nanocrystals and anisotropic growth of these subunits. During the formation of hierarchical nanostructures, SO42− plays a very important role in guiding the self-assembly of subunits. In addition, we realized size-controllable synthesis of hierarchical TiO2 just by tuning experimental conditions, such as reaction time, and Ti(SO4)2 concentration. When used as anode materials in lithium ion batteries, hierarchical TiO2 displays much better cycling stability and rate performance than TiO2 nanoparticles. The good electrochemical performances are much attributed to its hierarchical structures and stability of secondary-structure assemblies.
