    , Accepted 14th December 2022First published on 14th December 2022AbstractOptical diffusers made of polymer composite materials are vital for many photonic and optoelectronic applictions such as backlight unit (BLU) in liquid crystal displays (LCDs), light extraction unit of organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs), and solar cells. We have described the types of optical diffusers, the theory and measurement of light scattering, some common approaches for fabricating optical diffusers, the potential applications and recent developments of optical diffusers containing optical physical unclonable functions (PUFs), optical random number generators, passive stretchable radiative coolers, diffuser -based deep neural networks, lensless cameras or imaging systems, and three dimensinonal (3D) displays including two dimensional (2D)/3D switchable displays, which provide effective ways for designing high-performance optical films in the applications of optical devices. To satisfy the requirements for applications in stretchable optoelectronics and optomechanics, tunable optical diffusers stimulated by electric field, heat, light, mechanical field, or ultrasound attract much attention. Polymer/liquid crystal (LC) composite films with tunable light transmittance, haze, and diffusing intensity have been firstly provided and set a great foundation for the next generation of flexible and switchable optical diffusers.
Introduction
Optical diffusers with high transmittance and high haze have been widely applied in aerospace, illumination, displays1 (Fig. 1a), imaging systems, sensing,2 photovoltaics, and optical sensors. There are two types of conventional optical diffusers for achieving sufficient optical diffusion—the first type is volume diffusers containing microparticles (MPs) or nanoparticles (NPs),1 and another type is surface-relief diffusers containing structured patterns. For the first type, polymer substrates used for the diffuse plates are mainly polyacrylates such as polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA),3–5 polystyrene (PS),6 polycarbonate (PC),7,8 and paraffin9 due to their excellent optical quality and easy processability. Inorganic or organic particles, including silica dioxide (SiO2),10 titanium dioxide (TiO2),11 cerium dioxide (CeO2),12 willemite,13 devitrite,14 and core–shell particles,15 act as light-scattering agents and are uniformly doped and dispersed in the polymer substrate to control the total transmission, haze, and light scattering ability (Fig. 1b), whose particle size and refractive index have significant effects on the spreading of transmitted light. For polymer blends such as poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET),16 ethylene-vinyl acetate, and poly(styrene-co-acrylonitrile) (SAN),7 the transmittance and haze can be simply adjusted by their mass ratios. Liu et al. have prepared the PMMA/PET light diffusers; their transmittance decreases in the PET concentration range of 0–10 wt% if the concentration is in the scale of 10–20 wt%, the transmittance is a constant when increasing to the range of 20–35 wt%, and the transmittance greatly increases and plateaus after PET concentration exceeds 35 wt%.16 The second type of diffusers, prepared by replica molding method, photolithography,17 embossing process, and electrospraying has high light transmittance and low light loss whose holographic diffusers have been tentatively studied from the perspective of theories and applications.18 The surface structures for scattering light are always rough surfaces, pyramids, microlenses, and other microstructures,19 which need complex fabrication methods and expensive instruments.

With the development of optical diffusers, Wadle et al. have prepared a novel optical diffuser named holographic diffuser to control the diffusion angle via three ways: control of the light resource, its subtended angle, and the holographic medium.20 When the light resource is used in a control panel, consumer television, and other devices, beam shaping is required. Arik et al. have designed light shaping diffusers for controlling the angular spread of transmitted light and homogenizing light sources (Fig. 1c).21 Irrespective of light-shaping diffusers or engineered diffusers, they are Gaussian diffusers, which imply randomness and lack of control. To produce non-Gaussian diffusers that have reduced scattering, more precise light distribution and controllable beam angle, a layer consisting of tiny ridges and valleys in front of a transparent polymer substrate is added, resulting in a similarly well-defined beam from a regular non-collimated light source. To accelerate the development of optical diffusers, light-diffusing materials take the first place by heat treatment of commercial soda-lime-silica glass, Butt et al. have prepared devitrite crystals consisting fans of needle-like crystals that have interspacing of up to a few hundred nanometers, thus enabling the light to be diffused to large scattering angles.14 Instead of exploring materials, 3M™ dual brightness enhancement films (DBEFs) were light management films used to increase the brightness of backlights in LCDs by recycling the light with wrong polarization (Fig. 1d).22
With an increasing need for stretchable optoelectronic and optomechanic applications, soft and tunable optical diffusers with flexible structures that change the light path and tune the diffusion capabilities simulated by electric field, heat,23 light, mechanical field, or ultrasound are strongly demanded.
Theory and measurements
If the light beams propagate through optical diffusers, the transparency is attenuated because light scattering as the average size of the scatterers is much smaller than light wavelength λ, Rayleigh scattering takes place (Fig. 2a), and the scattering intensity is almost proportional to 1/λ4, where λ is the wavelength of incident light.10,12 When the scatterer size is comparable or larger than λ, Mie scattering shows that the light intensity is irrelevant to λ. The two main technical indexes for evaluating light diffusing materials are transmittance and haze; haze and transmittance tests are carried out using a haze meter according to ASTM D1003-61. The intensity of incident light in Fig. 2b is I0 and the intensity of transmitted light in Fig. 2b is It; thus, the relative light transmittance is defined as T = It/I0 × 100%, the haze is expressed as: H = (It)902.5/I0, (It)902.5, which means a part of forward transmitting light that is scattered by more than 2.5°. To further characterize the optical performance, angle-light density measurement is performed to characterize the angular distribution of optical diffusers, an optical spectrometer is set up (Fig. 2c) for detecting the intensity of the scattered light at different angles by rotating the sample and the light source together to make the incident light remain normal to the diffuser. If the optical diffuser is tested in the full wavelength range of 400–700 nm, then the UV-vis spectra is obtained using a UV-vis spectrometer (Lambda, Fig. 2d) equipped with an integrating sphere accessory according to the testing standard ASTM-D1003 (Fig. 2d). When light passes through an optical diffuser, I1 is the total intensity of the light source, I2 is the optical intensity after going through the optical diffuser, and I1 and I2 are tested by an integration sphere with a standard white plate with extremely high diffuse reflection ability. I3 is the intensity of atmosphere scattering and I4 is the scattering light intensity of the diffuser as the angle is from ±2.5° to ±90°. I3 and I4 are tested by an integration sphere without a standard white plate. Transmittance (T) is calculated according to the equation T = I2/I1 × 100%, and haze (H) is calculated according to the equation H = (I4/I2 − I3/I1) × 100%.

Volume optical diffusers
As for the preparation method of optical diffusers, a coating method has been widely applied to prepare two-layer diffusers (Fig. 3a). Kim et al. have fabricated the PC-based optical diffusers via a twin-extrusion compounding process, followed by a hot-melt compression molding process.24 For the first type optical diffusers, diffusing particles can be divided into inorganic and organic particles. When using dense particles25 (Fig. 3b), thermal stability is low and particle agglomeration happens. To solve this problem, hollow particles25 (Fig. 3c) with nanometer or micrometer size have attracted much attention. Using the electrospraying process, Kim et al. have demonstrated a simple and cost-effective technique for coating hemispherical PMMA particles on PET films; thus, the prepared optical diffuser has a transmittance of 50% and its light diffusivity is much higher than that of the pure PET film.26,27 As optical diffusers are easily distorted and warped under high humidity and high temperature environment, they fabricated PMMA-based optical diffusers reinforced with glass fibers, which leads to low shrinkage. In addition, optical diffuser made of PET/PC/PBT copolymer has been prepared and its thermophysical property are improved. Using boehmite hollow microspheres as diffusing particles, good light transmittance and diffusion capacity are obtained. In addition, due to the special physical and chemical properties of hybrid core–shell particles, polysiloxane@boehmite-based optical diffusers have superior diffusing property.12 Zhao et al. have prepared a light diffusing film including core–shell scatterers (Fig. 3d) by the melt blending method of dispersing organic silicone bead (OSB) in the PC/SAN blend.7 To overcome the disadvantages of high thermal sensitivity, poor UV-shielding effect, and low NIR absorption in the present optical diffuser, the novel optical diffuser based on nano(ZnO-CeO2)@polysiloxane core–shell hybrid microspheres has obtained suitable light transmittance and diffusion capacity.28 Hu et al. have prepared an innovative and cost-effective optical diffusing ZnO@polysiloxane microspheres by a facile hydrothermal method.29 By the controlled one-pot process, Hu et al. have synthesized polysiloxane@CeO2@PMMA microspheres, and the fabricated optical diffuser shows enhanced UV-shielding effect, heat resistance, and anti-aging property. Zhong et al. have utilized polysiloxane@3D follow-like hollow Mg–Al layered double hydroxides (LDH) microspheres as optical diffusing fillers (Fig. 3e); the as-prepared optical diffuser can obtain high transmittance (86%) and high haze (88%) as the concentration of the filler is over 15 wt%.30,31 To improve the optical properties of the silica/UV-cured polymer composite films by the two steps of sol–gel silica coating around the template and acid dissolution removal of the template, Suthabanditpong et al. have synthesized the hollow silica nanoparticles via the inorganic particle template method that involves the removal of the core-template by acid dissolution; the prepared hollow silica nanoparticles with a hierarchical structure within the composite film improves the total transmittance and the diffusing ability of the silica/polymer composite film.32 Wang et al. have provided an approach for fabricating optical diffusers based on silicone emulsions, which consist of silicone polymer and aq. NaCl solution, and where microscaled water droplets with various sizes distributed randomly in the silicone polymer, with good diffusing performance.33 By mimicking the microstructure and nanostructure of compound eyes, Guo et al. have presented a facile method to fabricate particle-diffusing diffuser with high transmittance and high haze based on microstructure and nanostructure strawberry-like PMMA-SiO2 composite microspheres (Fig. 3f) by the electrostatic attraction between positively-charged PMMA spheres and negatively-charged SiO2; high transmittance of 94.6% and high haze of 84.2% have both achieved for the microsphere.34 Optical diffusers prepared by ZnO-quantum dots (QDs)@polysiloxane present decreased dependence on the incident light angle and excellent aging performance compared to those based on ZnO-CeO2@polysiloxane.35 A novel method by combining UV-initiated polymerization induced phase separation (PIPS) and post-encapsulation to fabricate porous particle-free optical diffusers has been introduced for achieving high transparency (88%) and superhigh haze (88%).36

Surface-relief optical diffusers
To make microstructured optical diffusers, various methods such as holographic recording, soft lithography, replica molding (Fig. 4), ink printing, ultrasonic embossing, and surface texturing are applied. Alqurashi et al. have fabricated optical diffusers using nanosecond laser-induced surface texturing, which leads to the direct laser ablation of float glass substrates (without any polymer coating) for fabricating tailored surface textures and roughness.37–39 By changing the machine parameters, the characteristics of the patterned optical diffusers can be varied. When the femtosecond laser ablates, the fabricated nanoscale and microscale surface structures on the float glass lead to a diffusion angle up to 172°.40,41 The method of laser-induced surface texturing has a fast-processing time and flexibility of patterning various geometries. Unlike the traditional nanosecond and femtosecond laser surface texturing, advanced continuous wave (CW) CO2 laser is utilized for fabricating optical diffusers due to high efficiency, high power, and low capital cost.41 Stress-induced undulations on the surface of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) are presented when exposed to oxygen plasma, resulting in large-scale and low-cost microstructures on the polymer substrate. Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) embedded with Morpho-butterfly wing scales acts as an optical diffusion and shows maximum optical diffusion at ∼185° due to perfect periodic nanostructures.39–41

Novel optical diffusers
To produce an electrically variable optical diffuser, devitrite and liquid crystals (LCs) are combined together; the threshold voltage to switch the transmitted light from a predominating horizontal diffusion to a random order is 3.5 V (Fig. 5a and b).41,42 Moreover, the polymer/LC composite films are applied in many electro-optical devices due to the difference in the refractive indices between the polymer and LCs, and light scattering is produced; thus, polymer/LC composite films can be applied as optical diffusers. By designing the molecules of polymeric monomers, the microstructures of the polymer in the polymer/LCs are varied, which leads to different optical properties. Ma et al. have demonstrated polymer-dispersed liquid crystal (PDLC) films where LC droplets with an average diameter of 3.0 μm are dispersed in the polymer networks; the transmittance of the optical diffuser has reached 90.0% and the haze has reached 88.5%.43 As the average diameter of LC droplets is changed to 10.0 μm, the transmittance and haze become 90.2% and 39.2%, respectively. The polymer microstructures are varied in the polymer/LC composite films. Zhou et al. have designed a special morphology based on a thermally-cured polymer/LC composite films; combining polymer networks and polymer balls in the special morphology, the transmittance of the as-prepared optical diffuser can reach 93% and the haze can reach 95%, which accelerates the development of optical diffusers.44 By adjusting the curing temperature, curing time, and curing agent, Zhou et al. have optimized a polymer morphology based on polymer microballs; as the average size of the uniform spherical polymer balls is 3.33 μm, the as-prepared optical diffuser can obtain high transmittance (>94%) and high haze (>94%).45 For preparing switchable optical diffuser, Zhou et al. have produced an optical diffuser with transient polymer balls-networks (Fig. 5c and d), which has high transmittance (96.42%), high haze (90.49%), and excellent diffusing ability that the viewing angle in the off state is 150° and the viewing angle is 120° with the applied voltage of 40.0 V.43–48

Mahpeykar et al. have fabricated a novel optical diffuser based on cellulose nanocrystals, which are embedded in the polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) matrix, offering the as-prepared optical diffuser unique surface properties, mechanical flexibility, and optical transparency.49 When the content of the cellulose nanocrystals is optimized, high transmittance (85%) and high haze (>85%) are achieved.50 Ohzono et al. have demonstrated a tunable optical diffuser based on deformable wrinkles, which have a periodicity in the range of hundreds of micrometers. The fabricated optical diffuser shows no wrinkles and optical diffusion without strain; when adding a uniaxial strain, aligned wrinkles and anisotropic diffusion of the incident light are produced.51 Jiang et al. have demonstrated tunable optical diffusers based on PDMS (Fig. 5e and f); as PDMS precursors are exposed to UV/ozone, hard silica layers are obtained, which make the precursors crosslinked via heating; thus, the obtained wrinkle patterns show strain-dependent tunability.52
Yang et al. have proposed an approach to fabricate an optical diffuser by interfacial hydrogen-bonding polymer complexation; one polymer has been replaced by the dispersed polymer complex nanoparticles (NPs) for the layer-by-layer (L-B-L) assembly of poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVPON) and poly(acrylic acid) (PAA), and light diffusion performance has been enhanced.53–56 Stretchable and bendable optical diffusers are indispensable components in wearable display devices by constructing interfacial hydrogen bonding among methylcellulose (MC), poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO), and polymer complex nanoparticles (PCNP), which exhibits 92% transmittance, 93% haze, and 73% elongation. When in the stretching state, 88% transmittance and 93% haze is achieved.53–56
Potential applications and recent development of optical diffusers
Except for being applied in the liquid crystal displays (LCDs), Lim et al. have investigated a simple and cost-effective method to fabricate a porous polymer film, which shows 40% optical haze and is applied as a diffuser film for strong microcavity organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs); thus the viewing angle dependency of the microcavity OLEDs has been reduced.57,58 The incorporation of various micro-to-nanometer scale structures onto the glass substrate helps light to escape from OLEDs, leading to higher external quantum efficiency (EQE).54 Suh et al. have fabricated a nanoporous polymer film as well as light extraction component, which redistributes light propagation to realize almost ideal light distribution with an enhanced EQE.59 Hierarchical mesoporous silica NPs act as superb light scattering materials due to multiple scattering at the interfaces between different particles and air; the optical path difference between adjacent particles increases, which enhances the photoelectric conversion efficiency (PCE) of solar cells. Moreover, a nanopaper consisting of transparent wood-based cellulose nanofibers with ultrahigh transmittance (∼96%) and ultrahigh haze (∼60%) has been applied in enhancing the PCE of solar cells.60 Wu et al. have presented a nanocellulose-based film with optical transmittance of 90% and tunable diffuse transmittance of 78%, which improves the illuminous efficiency by almost 15% when it is applied as the light extraction layer of OLEDs.61 By directly fabricating the surface structures on a stretched planar elastomer substrate, when stretching the diffusers mechanically along the lens array, the diffusing angle of the fabricated diffusers is switched and the hydrophilic to superhydrophobic states are reversibly changed.62 Liang et al. have fabricated an optical diffuser composed of polystyrene-fiber rods (PFRs) dispersed in polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) resin, adding QDs for enhancing the photoluminescence intensity (Fig. 6a); the light path length is extended due to scattering and the total internal reflection loss of LED decreases.63 Recently, there are many key advances in the applications of optical diffusers, including Anderson localization of light,64 optical physical unclonable functions,65 optical random number generators,66 passive stretchable radiative coolers,67 diffusers-based deep neural networks,68 lensless cameras or imaging systems,69 and 3D displays including 2D/3D switchable displays.70 In 1958, scientists found that the coherent scattering of electrons happens when passing through disordered crystals.64 Based on that, Anderson mentioned that scattering from disorder can result in a halt of transport.64 If a material has random refractive index, Anderson localization of light takes place; for photonic crystals, the tunable refractive index traps light in the same way as electrons are trapped in semiconductors. Light localization happens in diffusers consisting of high scattering materials; in the localization part, transmission decreases exponentially with the diffuser thickness.64 Core–shell NPs (TiO2@silica) in ethanol solution is a strongly disordered object (Fig. 6b); an absorption effect exists at localization transition.71,72 Optical PUF plays a vital role in counterfeiter, hardware security solutions, or device authentication, which is a complicated physical entity that cannot be accurately copied or cloned due to its inherent randomness in the fabrication process.65 Conventional laser scattering optical PUF based on the scattering of 3D disordered structures is limited as the structures are fixed. Native silk has been widely applied in textiles, which can replace a coherent light source for optical PUF.73 Due to its randomly nano/microfibrillar structure, the transmitted light through the holes focuses strongly on the image plane.73 “Challenge” receives an instance-specific output or “response” (Fig. 6c), the 2D speckle pattern acts as the response, which depends on random inhomogeneities.74 A reconfigurable laser scattering optical PUF based on the reversible phase transition behavior of vanadium dioxide (VO2) nanocrystals combined with TiO2 disordered NPs with reversible challenge-response behavior is designed to improve the security for high-security authentication and encryption.65 By molding the surface structures of natural plant tissue, optical bionic PUFs are fabricated for wide applications in cryptographic primitives.75 The preparation of PUF anti-counterfeiting label based on structural colors adds a novel dimension to anti-counterfeiting technology.75

Through the optical diffusers in free space, utilizing a variety of 2D arrays of random numbers, optical ghost diffraction and information transmission are proposed.66 The optical model is demonstrated in Fig. 6d; a laser can be adjusted by the information carriers, the tunable light propagates by the diffusing channel composed of diffusers, and the light information is collected by a detector and used for retrieval. These 2D patterns propagate at object wave path, and the light intensity is collected by the detector.66
For saving energy, passive cooling has attracted great interests as it can cool materials down without inputting any extra energy.76 Radiative cooling that can remove heat from materials with nano/microvoids via the emission of thermal radiation to cold space has recently attracted tremendous interests (seen in Fig. 6e).67 The nano/microvoids in the polymer film contribute significantly in enhancing the solar reflectance and thermal emittance. If the periodic re-entrant structure with nano/microvoids is realized in the polymer, the total scattering efficiency and the probability of infrared absorption/emission through multiple diffuse reflection at different incident angles are enhanced, which is advantageous to the radiative heat exchange between the structural polymer and the atmosphere, achieving subambient cooling of 8.2 °C during the night and 6.0 °C to 8.9 °C during midday.77 Cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) can assemble into helical periodic structures; the resulting nonabsorptive films with structurally colored reflection are provided and lower the temperature by up to 9 °C under solar illumination.78 Porous cellulose structures realized by electrospinning have high reflectance (>90%) and reduce the sample temperature by up to 15 °C; in contrast, homogeneous cellulose structures achieved by casting have high transparency (>90%) and reduce the sample temperature by up to 5 °C.79
Deep learning executes advanced inference tasks using computers and presents great achievements in imaging through scattering the media.80 The optical diffractive deep neural networks built based on passive structures perform complex functions using computer-based neural networks.68 The scattering in optical diffusers leads to the degeneration of light intensity and phase; to recover the intensity and phase information, deep neural networks have been employed. Through thin optical diffusers, object imaging can be reconstructed by reversing the scattering process holographically. If the object is placed behind a thin diffuser equipped with coherent light, a speckle pattern is obtained (Fig. 6f). Only by imaging the scattered light intensity without further measurement, the change within the medium can be detected; moreover, the dynamic processes within a diffusing object are imaged.69 Using an unconventional imaging lens as the scattering medium, lensless 3D imaging with diffraction-limited resolution is presented.81 3D displays have an important influence on display applications in medical imaging and video games, which produces volume pixels and emits light with various colors and brightness in different directions. Conventional 3D displays achieve 3D effect using special glasses, while autostereoscopic 3D displays show low resolution and low light efficiency by applying lenticular lens. Using a projector and an optical diffuser, the diffusion angle can be optimized to send all image light to the observers. Wang et al. have proposed an integral imaging-based 2D/3D switchable display system equipped with an optical element, a PDLC film, and a projector; as the PDLC film is in the scattering mode, the system works in the 2D mode; if the PDLC film is in the transparent mode, the projector shows a Bragg-matched 3D image, and the system works in the 3D mode.82
Conclusions and perspectives
Tunable and switchable optical diffusers have attracted much attention due to the development of next-generation stretchable optoelectronic and optomechanic applications. Optical diffuser films based on polymers and LCs by the method of polymerization-induced phase separation provide a new approach for the preparation of high-performance optical devices and offer a broader horizon for application. Due to the diversity of both polymers and LCs, the special polymer structures and average size of LC droplets in the polymer/LC composite films are adjustable by simply designing their chemical structures and composition ratios; in addition, the light diffusing ability of the as-prepared films is switched by various electric field strengths, which has unlimited potential in the applications for flexible and stretchable devices.
