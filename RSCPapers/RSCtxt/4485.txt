    , Accepted 3rd December 2022First published on 6th December 2022AbstractThe development of a sustainable energy source has been a great challenge, and photocatalysis technology has become the key to solve it. Based on the synthesis strategy of g-C3N4 and MOF materials, this article focuses on exploring the application of ZIF series, MIL series, UIO series and other series of MOF materials compounded with g-C3N4 in photocatalytic H2 production and CO2 reduction. The photocatalytic H2 production or CO2 reduction performance can be improved by the different composite synthesis methods, material morphology and the construction of heterojunctions with the combination of MOF series with g-C3N4. Finally, the research on photocatalysis of different series of MOF/g-C3N4 composites is summarized, and the application prospects are proposed.
1. Introduction
Today, mankind faces two urgent challenges. One is how to find clean and sustainable energy; the other, the growth of carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere is unstoppable, which have led to a thorny energy and environmental crisis.1–4 Several approaches were proposed to address these challenges. Among them, the use of photocatalytic technology to convert solar energy into chemical energy is considered as a promising green method to solve or alleviate future energy demand and environmental challenges.5–11 Photocatalytic technology not only solves the problem of achieving renewable, clean energy but also solves the problems of the greenhouse effect and energy shortage.12 Researchers all over the world have made great efforts in this field.13–16 Among the various semiconductor photocatalysts (e.g. TiO2, g-C3N4, ZnO, Fe2O3, CdS, BiPO4, BiVO4, MOFs, etc.) reported so far, the preparation of composites of both MOF and graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) has become a hot topic.17–25
Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) is one of the most stable materials in nature, and its structure is similar to that of graphene on a two-dimensional scale. In recent years, it has received extensive attention. Furthermore, the spacer layers between the g-C3N4 nanosheets also offer nanochannels for water transport through weak van der Waals force interactions, while larger molecules are retained.26,27 Currently, carbon nitride plays a major role in photocatalytic degradation, hydrogen production, and CO2 reduction.28–30 However, the photocatalytic activity of pristine g-C3N4 is prone to rapid complexation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs, which is significantly inhibited by the poor electron transfer efficiency due to the low specific surface area.31,32 Therefore, compounding of new semiconductors with g-C3N4 to achieve new photocatalytic materials is now a new research hotspot.
Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) have attracted much attention and also been widely used because of their structure.33–35 Due to the microporous structure, they have an excellent surface area.36,37 Most importantly, their structures can be tailored as needed by modulating the coordination patterns of organic linkers, metal ion clusters or inorganic metal ions.34 But the practical application of MOF materials is also limited because of the weak coordination bonds between the metal clusters and organic ligands.38,39 Luckily, MOF derivatives inherit many advantages of MOFs and solve the shortcomings to a great extent.40,41 Because MPFs have rich chemical structure modification, coupling with g-C3N4 can endow the original g-C3N4 with special characteristics.42–44 For example, Zhan et al.45 synthesized Mn-MOF/g-C3N4 composites by the calcination method and regulated them by Mn–N coordination induction to accelerate the transfer and separation of carriers and improve CO2 reduction. Xu et al.41 synthesized carbon-doped In2O3 hollow tubes by calcining MIL-68(In) and compounded them with g-C3N4 to improve CO2 photocatalytic activity. Lv et al.46 synthesized the composite g-C3N4@CoFe2O4/Fe2O3 by Co-doping MIL-53-NH2. Tian et al.47 modified tubular g-C3N4 with ZIF-8 nanoparticles by changing its morphology. Sonowal et al.48 and Li et al.49 enhanced the photocatalytic reaction by making materials into quantum dots and improving charge transfer.
Therefore, we combined the advantages of MOFs and g-C3N4, starting from the preparation strategy to the combination of MOF series with g-C3N4, respectively, for the preparation of clean energy, and CO2 reduction performed with the above prepared composite is reported for further analysis and evaluation (Scheme 1). We found that the composites showed better catalytic performance, and these not only improved the separation and transfer of charge carriers but also improved the photocatalytic activity of pristine g-C3N4. This article mainly reviews the recent literature on MOF/g-C3N4 composites for photocatalytic hydrogen production and CO2 reduction.

2. Strategies for the synthesis of g-C3N4 and MOF materials
2.1. Synthesis strategy of g-C3N4-based composites
During the preparation of g-C3N4-based composites, significant changes in the efficiency of the catalysts were observed with the different integrated synthesis strategies employed. In recent years, the commonly used methods such as hydrothermal and solvothermal methods,50,51 solid-phase synthesis,52 self-assembly,53 and deposition54 have been used.
The hydrothermal reaction process refers to the process under certain temperature and pressure, a general term for chemical reactions that take place in fluids such as water, water solutions or vapors.55 The hydrothermal method is widely used for the synthesis of g-C3N4-based composites. As shown in Fig. 1(a–e), the SEM and TEM images show that RGO and g-C3N4 are uniformly deposited on CoZnAl-LDH with strong interactions between the precursors. Therefore, it can be guessed that in the hydrothermal reaction, RGO and g-C3N4 were embedded in the interstices of CoZnAl-LDH, and in this way, the synergy between each group will further improve the photocatalytic conversion of CO2 and the adsorption efficiency of CO2 enhances the light-harvesting capacity, and limits carrier complexation by forming Z-type heterostructures.56

Self-assembly means that elements can organize themselves into specific patterns or structures without external interference. Electrostatic, van der Waals force and hydrophobic interactions are the main driving forces controlling the self-assembly process.57 Electrostatic self-assembly is a suitable method for heterostructure fabrication, whether in morphology control or at the nanoscale.58 Generally speaking, in electrostatic self-assembly, synthesis of heterostructures is accomplished by strong interface contact between precursors with opposite charges. The schematic diagram of the synthesis process of the g-C3N4/ZnO composite, as shown in Fig. 2a, was reported by Nie et al.59 Additionally, the Zeta potential analysis results of g-C3N4 and ZnO shown in Fig. 2b. The positive and negative electromotive potentials of g-C3N4 and ZnO promoted the successful deposition of g-C3N4 nanosheets on ZnO microspheres, respectively, which was further confirmed from the HRTEM and FESEM images (Fig. 2c–e).

The solid-state synthesis of g-C3N4 matrix composites is completed by drying the mixture before high-temperature calcination under the protection of air or nitrogen.60 In the last several years, compared with other methods of heterojunction synthesis, solid-state synthesis is the most favored method because it is easy to operate and simple. The template method is a synthesis method that takes a template as the main configuration to control, affect and modify the morphology of materials, control the size, and then determine the properties of materials, because it involves the use of pre-existing conductive agents with required characteristics to synthesize nano materials into specific forms that are difficult to be realized by other methods.61,62 However, this method is tedious and rigorous, and the prepared templates will be damaged if not careful. The deposition–precipitation method for the synthesis of multiphase catalysts is achieved by depositing one active precursor on top of another, by slowly adding the precursor to the precipitation solution. The formation of precipitation generally includes two processes nucleation formation and nucleation growth.63 Based on the fact that there are different synthetic strategies for g-C3N4 composite preparation, we can prepare the same substance according to different methods and the photocatalytic properties of the substance will be changed.
2.2. g-C3N4 synthesis strategy
g-C3N4 is a non-metallic semiconductor containing only C and N, which is widely used. It is prepared by thermal polymerization, electrochemical deposition, template method, solvothermal method and solid phase synthesis method. The prepared precursors also include various kinds, such as melamine, urea, thiourea, dicyandiamide, etc.
Thermal polymerization is a simple preparation method. In recent years, it has become a common and important method to synthesize g-C3N4. First, put the precursor into an alumina crucible, react at high temperature in a semi closed environment for a certain time to obtain light yellow blocky g-C3N4, and then grind the blocky g-C3N4 in a mortar to obtain light yellow g-C3N4 powder.64
Electrochemical deposition is mainly used to prepare g-C3N4 thin films. The preparation process is complex, but the equipment is simple and easy to control. Electrochemical deposition is a liquid phase method, which refers to the formation of a loop from the cathode and anode in a certain electrolyte solution under the action of an electric field, and the redox reaction occurs to deposit the ions in the solution to obtain a film. Bai et al.65 synthesized hollow carbon nitride microspheres by electrochemical deposition. This method is simple and effective and can be carried out at low temperature. The synthesized hollow microsphere carbon nitride has application prospects in many aspects such as biomolecular adsorption and catalysis.
The template methods include the soft template method and the hard template method. The soft template method uses organic templates such as surfactants in the preparation of g-C3N4, which can affect the aggregation of inorganic phases around its growth; the hard template method uses a rigid template in the preparation of g-C3N4. First, the precursor solution is injected into the template hole and g-C3N4 is formed in the fixed channel.66 For the template method, the last step to remove the template may have residues and risks. Wang et al.67 reported that the preparation of porous graphite phase polymeric carbon nitride using calcium carbonate particles as a hard template is not only economical but also involves an easy to remove step by dilute hydrochloric acid.
2.3. MOF synthesis strategy
Metal organic framework compounds are a kind of porous materials formed by self-assembly of metal ions (or clusters) coordinated with organic ligands. At present, there are many synthetic methods of MOFs, including the volatilization method, diffusion method, solvothermal method, microwave synthesis method, electrochemical synthesis method, ultrasonic synthesis method, and so on. With the difference of various synthesis methods, the advantages and disadvantages are also very obvious. MOFs are also particularly rich in applications such as catalysis, drug transport, pollutant adsorption, etc.
Solvothermal synthesis is the most effective way to synthesize MOFs. The solvothermal method generally means that the reactants such as ligands, metal salts and reaction solvents are mixed thoroughly and transferred together into a sealed reactor, after reacting at high temperature for 12–48 hours, the ligand and metal salt self-assembled and precipitated crystals in the presence of the solvent to obtain the product.68 The MOFs synthesized by the solvothermal method have good dispersion and complete crystal structure. However, the solvothermal reaction takes a long time, costs a lot, and requires a large number of organic solvents, which will cause environmental pollution. Wang et al.69 used zinc nitrate, zinc acetate, and zinc sulfate as metal ion zinc sources, imidazole, 2-methylimidazole, and benzimidazole as organic ligands, and DMF as an organic solvent to prepare ZIF-8 crystals. The crystal morphology and molar ratio of organic ions were observed by ZIF-8.
Microwave synthesis technology is often used in the preparation of MOFs.70 In the microwave synthesis process, the reactant is fully mixed with the solvent, transferred to the microwave reaction vessel, sealed and placed in the microwave unit, and heated for a suitable time at a specific temperature, after which the microwave reactor couples the applied oscillating electric field with the permanent dipole moment of the molecules in the reactant, thus causing the molecules to rotate and the liquid phase to heat up rapidly. The microwave method has the advantage of a short reaction time. Generally speaking, the microwave method has the advantages of a short reaction time and accurate control of the reaction process, but the microwave reaction container is small and cannot be mass produced. Zhang et al.71 used Zn(NO3)2·6H2O as a metal source and 1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid as an organic ligand, dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide (DEF) and reacted to obtain a clarified solution. Then the solution was transferred to a microwave reactor and heated for 25 s to obtain orange IRMOF-3.
The ultrasonic electrochemical method is a simple and traditional method to synthesize a metal organic framework, which is to dissolve organic ligands and metal salts in the benign solution and precipitate crystals through solvent volatilization. Electrochemical synthesis is inseparable from the electrolytic cell. The metal ion source always provides a metal for the anode of the sacrificial electrode. The metal ions react with the dissolved ligand ions in the conductive medium to achieve coordination and generate MOF crystals.72 The advantage of the electrochemical method is that it can be run continuously to obtain more products, and it is relatively simple and environmentally friendly.
3. Application of different series of MOF/g-C3N4 composites
In recent years, various MOF materials were compounded with g-C3N4, and the modified composite photocatalysts significantly reduced the electron–hole complex efficiency and improved the photocatalytic performance of g-C3N4, Obviously, the large surface area promotes the adsorption of CO2 and provides a large number of reaction sites.73,74 There is also evidence that the interaction of MOFs with g-C3N4 can improve the visible light efficiency of the composites.75 In this section, we review the latest progress of different series of MOF/g-C3N4 compounds and their applications in hydrogen production and CO2 conversion.
3.1. ZIF series/g-C3N4 composite photocatalysis
ZIF material has the high constancy of inorganic zeolite materials, rich porosity and organic functionality. ZIF can be applied to hydrogen production,76 gas adsorption and separation,77,78 CO2 adsorption,79 and catalysts.80 In this section, photocatalytic exploration will be performed from ZIF series and g-C3N4. ZIF-8 and ZIF-67 are imidazole metal organic frameworks, which are, respectively, composed of zinc ions and cobalt ions and imidazole salts. Their preparation methods are relatively simple and easy to obtain. They improve the hydrogen evolution and CO2 reduction efficiency by improving the charge separation ability, light capture ability, etc.
He et al.81 constructed ZIF-8 derived carbon (C-ZIF)/g-C3N4 composites for the first time by simple thermal condensation of ZIF-8 and melamine. The mechanism is shown in Fig. 3(a). TEOA consumes holes on g-C3N4, promotes the separation of electron holes, and produces hydrogen on the surface of C-ZIF. Compared with pure g-C3N4, the obtained C-ZIF/g-C3N4 composite exhibits an obvious photocatalytic hydrogen production rate under visible light irradiation. Dai et al.82 used ionic liquid as the template to prepare Ag–AgBr/g-C3N4/ZIF-8 ternary composites using the in situ growth method, as shown in Fig. 3(b), which is the preparation flow chart. The AgBr prepared with ionic liquid as the template has better dispersion and agglomeration inhibition. The protonated carbon nitride has better specific surface area and morphology. The structure of the composite is optimized by modifying g-C3N4 with MOFs and precious metals. Ag+ can be a bridge forming a multi-path electron transmission path, accelerating the electron transfer, to improve the hydrogen evolution efficiency. Tian et al.47 used ZIF-8 nanoparticles modified on rod-like g-C3N4 materials to form composites with controlled interfacial contacts, as shown in the preparation flow. The photocatalytic hydrogen production was enhanced by changing the charge transport and electron–hole separation. Li et al.83 prepared Co@NC/g-C3N4 composites by one-step thermal decomposition. N-doped carbon (NC) was formed after carbonization of ZIF-67. The obtained Co@NC/g-C3N4 composite material can realize photocatalytic hydrogen production from water without any noble metal cocatalyst under simulated sunlight. The mechanism of photocatalytic production of H2 by Co@NC/g-C3N4 composites is shown in Fig. 4. Under simulated sunlight, g-C3N4 absorbs photons and internal electrons are excited and transferred to the conduction band. The electrons in the conduction band of g-C3N4 are rapidly transferred to the N-doped Co intermediate, and the hydrogen evolution reaction occurs. At the same time, triethanolamine (TEOA) as a sacrificial reagent consumes holes on the valence band of g-C3N4. Devarayapalli et al.84 coupled ZIF-67 with g-C3N4 by microwave radiation, and the amount of H2 released was about 2084 μmol g−1, 3.84 times that of pure g-C3N4. Wang et al.85 doped g-C3N4 with ZIF-67 and then introduced MoS2 nanoparticles on the surface to prepare composite materials. The hydrogen evolution efficiency is about 30 times that of pure g-C3N4.

Liu et al.86 prepared porous graphite carbon nitride (g-C3N4) nanotubes to improve their light harvesting ability, redox potential and charge separation efficiency. Then, an appropriate amount ZIF-8 nanoclusters were added to the prepared tubular g-C3N4 to further improve the CO2 capture ability without reducing the light absorption ability, and the reduction product was CH3OH. The literature fully demonstrates that the thin tubular structure is conducive to charge separation.87–89 At the same time, the tubular structure and the holes penetrating the tube wall are beneficial to the mass transfer of reactants and products in the photocatalytic reaction. Meng et al. prepared ZIF-67/g-C3N4 composites.74 As shown in Fig. 5, the g-C3N4/ZIF-67 composite has a high specific surface area and active sites. Photogenerated electron transfer between ZIF-67 and g-C3N4 not only improves the separation efficiency but also prolongs the life of electrons and holes, thereby improving the photocatalytic conversion efficiency. Different from ZIF-8 and g-C3N4, the CO2 reduction product is CH3CH2OH, and the yield is also significantly increased. Similarly, Chen et al.90 used the coupling with the electron donor Co-MOF to improve the photo activity of g-C3N4, thereby increasing the CO2 reduction efficiency. This article mainly uses molecular orbital occupation to promote charge separation and finally releases CH4 and CO with yields of 5.47 μmol g−1 h−1 and 6.75 μmol g−1 h−1, respectively.

3.2. MIL series/g-C3N4 composite photocatalysis
Compared with conventional zeolite and graphite materials, MIL series materials have unique advantages such as porosity, large specific surface area, and unsaturated metal coordination sites. MIL materials can also be used for the adsorption and separation of gases such as CH4, CO2, CO, and N2,91,92 have applications in catalysis, and have good slow-release ability for the drug ibuprofen.93 In this section, the photocatalytic investigation will be carried out from MIL series complexed with g-C3N4. The MIL materials include MIL-53 (Fe), MIL-101 (Fe), MIL-88B (Fe), MIL-68 (In) and MIL-125 (Ti), all of which are used to enhance photocatalytic hydrogen production and CO2 reduction by providing a larger number of reaction sites through a larger specific surface area.
Creating heterojunctions has become a common method to improve photocatalytic performance. In recent years, ternary heterojunctions have been used more frequently. The appropriate arrangement of ternary heterojunctions and the reduction ability of different catalysts will enhance the rapid separation of charges. Wang et al.94 first used hydrothermal and wet chemical methods to prepare B-TiO2/MIL-53 (Fe)/CN ternary composites. Due to the appropriate arrangement of the three components, the material promoted the separation and transfer of the charge carriers at the interface contact point and enhanced the photoactivity. As shown in Fig. 6(a), the hydrogen production effect of the ternary composite B-TiO2/MIL-53 (Fe)/CN is better than that of MIL-53 (Fe)/CN and B-TiO2/CN under visible light and ultraviolet irradiation. Fig. 6(b) shows a photocatalytic performance diagram under ultraviolet and visible light irradiation. The comparison of Fig. 6(a) and (b) shows that the ternary material has better absorption of ultraviolet light. Fig. 6(c) and (d) show the photocatalytic reaction cycle diagram. It is found that the formation of H2 is not significantly reduced after 4 h, indicating that the catalyst is very stable.

NH2-MIL-101 (Fe) is an iron containing MOF composed of iron oxide clusters and amino terephthalate. It can be used both as a sacrificial template and a metal precursor to prepare Fe2P polyhedra with many exposed edges and adsorption sites. On the other hand, its high specific surface area makes it an ideal carrier for stabilizing nanoparticles, preventing nanoparticle aggregation and fixing g-C3N4, so as to prepare g-C3N4-based composites with close contact interfaces for rapid charge transfer. Xu et al.95 modified graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) with C, N co-doped Fe2P/Ni2P (CN/FeNiP) polyhedral prepared by NH2-MIL-101 (Fe)/Ni (OH)2 as co-catalysts for hydrogen production by water cracking under visible light irradiation. The advantages are the increase of specific surface area, the increase of reaction sites, and the introduction of Ni2P can suppress the photoinduced electron and hole complexation. It can be found from Fig. 7 that both Ni2P and pH affect the catalytic activity of the composite material. When Ni2P is 7.47% and pH = 10, the photocatalytic effect is the best. The H2 formation rate of NH2-MIL-125 (Ti)/0.75CN/Ni15.8Pd2.1 is 8.7 mmol g−1 h−1 as reported by by Xu et al.96 The enhanced photocatalytic activity is due to the accelerated charge transfer caused by the interface contact between the composites and the strong absorption capacity of the loaded bimetallic nanoparticles to visible light, resulting in the separation of electron–hole pairs.

Han et al. calcined MIL-68 (In)-NH2 at different temperatures to form an environment friendly In2O3 catalyst that can effectively photocatalyze hydrogen evolution.97 In addition, it is also mentioned in the literature that the derivatives of MOFs can improve the transfer efficiency of photogenerated carriers through the self-doping of C, thereby improving their photocatalytic performance.38 Therefore, Xu et al.41 synthesized carbon-doped In2O3 (C-In2O3) hollow tubes by calcination using MIL-68 (In) as a sacrificial template. C-In2O3/g-C3N4 heterostructures were obtained under hydrothermal conditions from C-In2O3 and g-C3N4. The unique hole tube structure, carbon doping and type II heterojunction of C-In2O3/g-C3N4 expand the light absorption capacity, promote the separation of photogenerated electron hole pairs, and thus significantly improve the photocatalytic activity of CO2 reduction. Iron is a rich metal element in the earth's crust, with high activity and low cost. Iron-based MOF materials are also well known, such as MIL-53 (Fe), MIL-101 (Fe) and MIL-88B (Fe). Sun et al.98 prepared the NH2-MIL-101 (Fe)/g-C3N4 heterostructure photocatalyst for photocatalytic CO2 reduction by self-assembling the g-C3N4 film on the surface of NH2-MIL-101 (Fe). The amino functional group was introduced into the metal–organic framework to improve the light absorption ability and enhance the affinity for CO2. The larger specific surface area provided CO2 adsorption sites, which improved the CO2 conversion efficiency. The yield of the reduced product CO was 132.8 μmol g−1, which was almost 7 times that of g-C3N4.
In 2009, Ferey and his colleagues first synthesized Ti-based MIL-125 (Ti). The potential application of this material in the field of photocatalysis and gas storage has attracted wide attention.99 This Ti-based MOF not only has good adsorption performance and thermal stability, but also can introduce high-density fixed titanium sites into its porous structure. However, its 3.72 eV wide band gap limits its function only in the UV region.100 Tahir et al.101 prepared NH2-MIL-125 (Ti) MOF/g-C3N4/RGO ternary composites using the simple hydrothermal method, as shown in Fig. 8. Amino functionalized MIL-125 (Ti) has a high specific surface area and porous structure, which greatly improves the photocatalytic efficiency. The introduction of RGO builds a bridge for charge transfer, which not only induces the effective separation and transfer of photogenerated carriers but also inhibits the recombination of electron hole pairs in g-C3N4. By testing other composites, the ternary composite shows the best CO2 reduction effect, where the CO yield is as high as 382.79 μmol g−1 h−1, which is 5 times higher than that of pure g-C3N4. Quantum dots are semiconducting materials with strong light trapping ability and good inhibition of charge complexation, and this ability brings prospects for their use in photocatalytic CO2 reduction. Li et al.49 proposed a new idea to improve MIL-125 (Ti). CuO quantum dots were encapsulated in the pores of the MIL-125 (Ti) metal organic skeleton using the simple complexation oxidation method and further combined with g-C3N4 to form g-C3N4/CuO@MIL-125 (Ti) composite photocatalysts, as shown in Fig. 9. During the reaction, the electrons and holes in MIL-125 (Ti) and g-C3N4 are separated and transferred. Finally, the electrons and holes were retained on the CuO quantum dots and the valence band position of g-C3N4, respectively, thus effectively inhibiting the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes, improving the photocatalytic performance102,103 and prolonging the life of the composite.

3.3. UIO series/g-C3N4 composite photocatalysis
The most common of the UIO family and most frequently used in photocatalytic applications is UiO-66. UiO-66 is a widely used MOF material with high chemical and hydrothermal stability and low toxicity.104,105 However, UiO-66 has the disadvantages of low solar energy conversion yield, high electron hole pair recombination rate and poor conductivity, which limits its application in all aspects.106 Therefore, in practical applications of UiO-66, it is necessary to solve the problems of its visible light absorption response to increase its application life. In this section, photocatalytic exploration will be carried out from the modification of UiO-66 or UiO-66 compounded with carbon nitride.
Wang et al.107 encapsulated UiO-66-NH2 by g-C3N4 and then combined with Ti to form a novel composite material. The introduction of Ti can form a Zr–O–Ti mixed metal component with Zr in the MOF to inhibit the recombination of electron holes, thereby improving photocatalytic hydrogen production. The H2 production efficiency of 0.1 g-C3N4/NH2-UiO-66 (0.1Ti) can reach 43.5 mmol g−1 h−1. Zhang et al.108 synthesized g-C3N4/UiO-66-NH2 (CNUIO) composites using the solvothermal method. Triethanolamine was used as a sacrificial reagent. Compared with single component g-C3N4 and UiO-66-NH2, the formation rate of the composite photocatalyst H2 changed significantly. With the increase of UiO-66-NH2 loading, the hydrogen production effect of CNUIO increased first and then decreased. This may be because UiO-66-NH2 partially covered the active center on the surface of g-C3N4, thus slowing down the photocatalytic reaction. Nickel phosphide (Ni2P) is a common semiconductor photocatalyst. Wang et al.109 first prepared g-C3N4/UiO-66 using the hydrothermal method and then assembled it with Ni2P in order to obtain a ternary composite catalyst. The introduction of Ni2P particles not only increases the specific surface area of the composite but also improves the separation of charges. As shown in Fig. 10, through the possible mechanism of the reaction, Ni2P grows on the edge of UiO-66, and after illumination, the charge is transmitted and finally the electrons are hydrolyzed on Ni2P to produce hydrogen, while triethanolamine consumes g-C3N4 holes. Wei et al.110 prepared a ternary photocatalyst using the hot solvent method α- SnWO4/UiO-66(NH2)/g-C3N4(α-SW/UNCN). Although g-C3N4 (CN) is a commonly used photocatalyst, it is rarely reported as a porous hexagonal prism structure. As shown in Fig. 11, this structure increases the specific surface area and is more conducive to the adsorption of substances. As an octahedron with uniform size, UiO-66 (NH2) is closely embedded on the surface of CN. The strong interaction between them will enhance carrier separation, thus improving the hydrogen production efficiency.

Shi et al.53 synthesized UiO-66/g-C3N4 nanosheet (UiO-66/CNNS) composites by electrostatic self-assembly. The increase of the specific surface area promotes the increase of CO2 adsorption sites and the increase of the reduction yield. Yu et al.75 reported that in order to improve the photocatalytic activity of NH2-UiO-66 for CO2 under visible light, CdTe quantum dots and g-C3N4 nanocrystals were introduced to form NH2-UiO-66/g-C3N4/CdTe composites using a two-step synthesis strategy. Different visible light ranges of g-C3N4 and CdTe have a strong absorption capacity, thus greatly expanding the light response wavelength range of composite materials. The possible reaction mechanism is shown in Fig. 12(a). Under visible light irradiation, the NH2-UiO-66/g-C3N4/CdTe composite exhibits excellent photocatalytic performance for CO2 conversion in the acetonitrile/ethanol system (≥400 nm), and the HCOOH formation rate is 24.6 μmol g−1 h−1. Sonowal et al.48 synthesized composite materials by coupling UiO-66 with carbon nitride quantum dots (g-CNQDs@MOF). The carbon nitride quantum dots improve the electronic conductivity of the composite catalyst. In CO2 reduction, these electrons accelerate the formation of active sites on the surface of the composite catalyst, thereby generating methanol more efficiently. Wang et al.111 synthesized g-C3N4–NHx/NH2-UiO-66 (NUZ/HGN) composites using the in situ growth method. Fig. 12(b) shows a possible mechanism diagram. NUZ nanocrystals are fixed on HGN through NHx–Zr–O chemical bonds, resulting in uniform dispersion of NUZ and avoiding the leaching of NUZ, thus showing excellent stability in photocatalysis. It is believed that the NHx–Zr–O bond facilitates the rapid electron transfer of HGN, thereby improving charge separation and photocatalytic reduction performance. The photocatalytic performance of NUZ/HGN is 31.6 μmol g−1 h−1, which is 2 times and 3 times that of NUZ and HGN, respectively.

3.4. Other series/g-C3N4 composite photocatalysis
In the past reports, most of the above three types of MOFs have been studied on photocatalysis, and their organic ligands are different, so there are slight differences in the changes of photocatalysis performance. But in a word, it is all for better capture of light to stimulate electron hole pairs, to a certain extent, promote photoinduced electron transfer, and improve the photocatalytic efficiency. There are also some uncommon MOF materials that react with g-C3N4 by photocatalysis.
Duan et al.112 prepared two dimensional bimetallic ZnCoMOF/g-C3N4 composites using the electrostatic self-assembly method. The composite catalyst has excellent hydrogen evolution performance, and the hydrogen evolution rate reaches 1014.11 μmol g−1 h−1, As shown in Fig. 13(a), the highest yield of CNZnCo5 was found in comparison experiments with different contents of CNZnCo, and the catalytic stability of CNZnCo was tested. Zhang et al.113 used a two-step hydrothermal method to synthesize NiXMo1−XS2/MOF-5@g-C3N4 composite catalysts; the authors use Ni2+ and Mo2+ to prepare metal complexes to modify g-C3N4, and combine with a MOF to provide more active sites than the surface. The authors investigated hydrogen production at different pH values, using TEOA as a cavity sacrificing reagent and found that the highest amount of hydrogen was produced at pH = 10, and all others had lower yields than at pH = 10. Xu et al.114 formed a composite BIF-20@g-C3N4 using the electrostatic self-assembly method nano sheet, as shown in Fig. 14(a). The existence of B–H bonds effectively inhibited the recombination of electron hole pairs and showed strong CO2 adsorption capacity. This composite catalyst increased the reduction rate of CO2 to CH4 by 9.7 times and the rate of CO by 9.85 times. Zhao et al.115 formed NiMOF/CN heterojunctions using the ultrasonic assisted in situ growth method. The composite has good gas response and CO2 reduction products are CO and CH4. As shown in Fig. 14(b), the composite is included in the preparation flow chart. Because NiMOF/CN has excellent charge transport, it makes the photocatalytic CO2 reduction product 18 times higher than that of pristine g-C3N4. Sun et al.116 used the synergy between composites to improve the photocatalytic CO2 reduction performance and prepared the RuL2L0@C3N4/MOF photocatalyst. Loading the cocatalyst on the surface of g-C3N4 not only increased the specific surface area and accelerated the electron transfer but also enhanced the light trapping power of CO2. Its CO yield was as high as 1562.7 μmol g−1 h−1 with a selectivity of 86.6%.

4. Summary and prospects
4.1. Summary
This article reviews the application of different series of MOF/g-C3N4 composites for photocatalytic hydrogen production and carbon dioxide reduction. The decomposition of water for hydrogen production and reduction of CO2 are mainly performed with solar irradiation. Combining the respective advantages of MOFs and g-C3N4, the materials were modified and compounded. MOFs/g-C3N4 matrix composites not only show high efficiency in hydrogen production but also have high selective gas adsorption due to their unique structure, which is also very important for CO2 reduction. From the literature, we can find that combining MOF materials with g-C3N4 through various methods (such as direct dispersion, hydrothermal growth, packaging and in situ preparation) can further adjust the electronic band structure and physical structure, benefiting from the unique properties of MOFs, and the synthesized composites have a higher specific surface area than pristine g-C3N4, resulting in more exposed active sites and a reduced rapid complexation of electron–hole pairs. The applications of different series of MOF/g-C3N4 composites are shown in Fig. 15.

4.2. Prospects
There is also room for better development of MOF/g-C3N4 in future, which can be considered from the following three aspects: (i) the morphology of g-C3N4 may have an impact on the photocatalytic efficiency, and in the future preparation of MOF/g-C3N4, we can try to prepare various morphologies of g-C3N4 (e.g., can be prepared as nanotubes, nanorods, nanospheres, etc.) in combination with MOFs. (ii) Binary complexes are now widely used, and we can prepare ternary complexes based on modified binary complexes. The third single component can be in the middle of MOF/g-C3N4 as an inhibitor to inhibit the complexation of photogenerated electron–holes, or it can be based on the previous two single components to increase their adsorption effect and the adsorption sites are improved. (iii) Quantum dots have been gradually applied by people. Therefore, in the future, quantum dots can be preferably selected in the preparation of materials. They can not only promote the rapid separation of charges but also may increase the activity of active sites.
