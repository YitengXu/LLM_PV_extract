An angled two-nozzle electrospinning process was used here, and the composite material that was produced has the large specific surface area of the NPs, the anisotropic properties of the NFs and distinctive optical and electronic properties of sheet-like structures, which is desirable for various applications. Different characterizations were examined using X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, photoluminescence spectroscopy, and UV-visible diffused reflectance spectroscopy. The prepared composite showed excellent photocatalytic activity with visible light when compared with pristine TiO2 and g-C3N4 and single-component modified Ag/TiO2 and TiO2/g-C3N4 composites, as measured by the degradation of different organic dyes. Here, the large surface area g-C3N4 sheets provide the formation of ternary hetero-structures among the NPs, NFs and sheets, and encouraged electron transfer between them. Moreover, such a hybrid composite showed improved antibacterial properties against both Gram-negative Escherichia coli and Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus bacteria.
1. Introduction
Since the start of the industrial revolution, water and air pollution has become one of the most pressing international concerns facing the world. In turn, photocatalysis is considered to be a green technology that enables solar energy to be used to purify water and air. So far, various promising photocatalysts with impressive photocatalytic activity have been discovered, but the most widely used photocatalysts have some disadvantages, such as, a high recombination rate of the photoinduced electrons and holes and low utilization of the effectiveness of solar energy due to the high band gap.1 Therefore, researchers have continued to develop highly-active visible-light photocatalysts to ensure energy conversion and environmental remediation. Many semiconducting materials have been investigated for their higher rate of photocatalytic activity. TiO2 is considered one of the most attractive and promising semiconductor catalysts because of its unique characteristics, including low cost, favorable optical and electronic properties, nontoxicity, and high chemical and photochemical stability.2,3 Moreover, among various TiO2 nanostructures, the one-dimensional (1D) morphologies of the NFs have drawn a significant amount of attention due to their large surface area and distinctively-oriented NFs array, which improves the separation efficiency for the charge carrier by reducing the recombination rate and, hence resulting in a highly photoactive material.4,5 However, TiO2 has two inherent drawbacks in photocatalysis; the utilization efficiency of solar energy is very low due to its wide band gap that allows it to only be activated with UV light, which engages no more than 4% of the solar energy; and a high recombination rate of the photoinduced electron–hole (e–h) couples. Therefore, great efforts have been made to seek the photoactivity of TiO2 in the visible range, such as with precise decoration using metallic NPs,6,7 the addition of non-metal atoms,8–10 doping with non-metal ions to increase the visible light absorbance,11,12 and coupling with other semiconductors with a narrower energy band gap to form hetero-structures to decrease the recombination rate of photogenerated e–h pairs.13–15
Recently, graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4), a metal-free visible-light photocatalyst with a proper band gap, has received an extensive amount of attention for its promising application toward photocatalytic hydrogen production from water and photodecomposition of organic pollutants.16,17 Moreover, a strong covalent bond between carbon and nitride atoms makes it a stable photocatalyst under light irradiation in water solution as well as in an acidic or basic solution.18 However, the efficiency of pure g-C3N4 is still far from ideal due to the rapid recombination of photo-generated e–h pairs and the high valence band position that fatally limits its catalytic activity. As a result, a considerable amount of attention has been placed on the modification of g-C3N4.19 Among these, the fabrication of hetero-structured composites that combine g-C3N4 with other active wide band gap semiconductors has drawn deep attention since it can notably decrease the rapid recombination of e–h pairs and can improve the electron transfer characteristics.20–22 More prominently, the highest occupied molecular orbital for g-C3N4 has been reported to be of −1.3 V versus a normal hydrogen electrode, and it is more negative than the conduction band of common wide band-gap semiconductors such as TiO2 and ZnO. This would promote forming a hetero-structure with wide band gap semiconductors and to extend their visible light response.23 Based on the advantages mentioned above, many efforts have been devoted for various kinds of TiO2–g-C3N4 composites in order to promote the photocatalytic activity of pure TiO2, which could not only improve the separation efficiency of e–h pairs, but could also broaden the absorption band toward the visible region.24,25
In addition, the coupling of noble metal NPs has also been applied in order to improve the photocatalytic performance of TiO2 and g-C3N4. Among the different metal NPs, silver (Ag) is an exceptionally attractive fine metal that should be considered as a result of its amazing catalytic activity. Reports have indicated that decorating with Ag NPs not only improves the photocatalytic activity of TiO2, but also improves the antibacterial activity.26–28 Such a coupling creates Schottky barriers at the contact region of the composite, which could result in a remarkable ability to trap electrons at each contact region, promoting charge separation and greater electron transfer. As a consequence, the photoactivity of the composite will improve.29 In addition, the coupling of fine Ag NPs on thin sheet of g-C3N4 has attracted much attention as a means to enhance absorption in the visible region.
To the best of our knowledge, there are no reports on the fabrication of such ternary hetero-structured composites in which the TiO2 NFs decorated by metal NPs are grafted on a thin sheet of g-C3N4. Chen Y. et al. recently synthesized a ternary hetero-structured composite of g-C3N4/Ag/TiO2 microspheres using a two way route, i.e. hydrothermal and photo-deposition method and studied the photocatalytic degradation under visible-light irradiation.30 However, in the present study, we demonstrate a simple and convenient method to fabricate ternary hetero-structures of 1D porous TiO2 NFs decorated with Ag NPs attached on g-C3N4 sheets in a one-step manner using angled two-nozzle electrospinning–calcination. The proposed method ensures not only the successful growth of Ag decorated TiO2 nanostructures on the g-C3N4 sheet, but also the homogeneous spreading of Ag-decorated TiO2 NFs on g-C3N4 sheet. The photo degradation behavior of Phenol Red (PR) and Reactive Black (RB) over the prepared photocatalysts was evaluated under natural sunlight. For comparison, the photocatalytic activity of bare TiO2 NFs, and pure g-C3N4 sheets were also evaluated under the same system. Moreover, high-throughput live/dead assays of Gram-negative E. coli and Gram-positive S. aureus bacteria were used to evaluate the antibacterial properties of the photocatalysts that were prepared.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials
Commercially-available g-C3N4 particles Nicanite® (Carbedon, Finland), acetic acid, titanium isopropoxide (TTIP), polyvinyl acetate (PVAc, Mw = 500000), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and silver nitrate (AgNO3) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich and were used as-received.
2.2. Fabrication of TiO2 NFs-interpolated g-C3N4 sheets
First, the TiO2 NFs grafted on the g-C3N4 sheet were prepared directly by using a simple and facile angled two-nozzle electrospinning–calcination process. Two separate solutions, known as solution I and solution II, were used during electrospinning. For both solutions, PVAc concentration of 18% prepared by dissolving in DMF solvent was used. Solution I was prepared by adding different amounts of g-C3N4 particles (1, 3, 5 and 10 wt% relative to the weight of PVAc) to the PVAc solution, and the mixture was subjected to bath sonication for two hours to disperse the g-C3N4 particles. Similarly, solution II was prepared by mixing 6 g of PVAc solution and 5 g of clear solution of titanium isopropoxide (TTIP) (obtained via the drop-wise addition of acetic acid with continuous stirring).
Electrospinning was carried out using a two-nozzle electrospinning system. Two solutions were each collected separately in a 12 ml plastic syringe connected to two spinneret holders with an air tight syringe needle (21 gauges) and were fixed in a separate motorized syringe pump assembly. Each needle tip was connected to two separate power supplies with identical applied voltage of 18 kV and tip-to-collector distance of 12 cm. The spinning feed rate was maintained at 1 ml h−1 for both solutions, and a Teflon foil covered, grounded drum-shaped collector made from aluminum was used to deposit the fibers. The angle between the two nozzle tips was maintained at 80°, and the all processes were carried out in ambient conditions. After electrospinning, the NFs membranes were vacuum dried at 80 °C overnight. Then, the vacuum dried electrospun mats were treated in air at 500 °C for 3 h at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1, which removed organics from the fibers. Moreover, at a high temperature of 500 °C, Ti{OCH(CH3)2}4 (TTIP) molecules could decompose into TiO2, CO2 and H2O. Here, CO2 and H2O escape rapidly, and only the TiO2 and g-C3N4 sheet remained. The as-prepared composites are denoted as “TCN-x”, where, “TCN” refers to the TiO2/g-C3N4 composite and x refers to the wt% of g-C3N4 with respect to the polymer weight, i.e., 1, 3, 5 and 10. Note that the mass ratio of the g-C3N4 sheet affects the spinnability of the solution. At above 10 wt% of the g-C3N4 sheet, the spinnability depreciates, and it is difficult to obtain fibers due to the increase in viscosity. The pristine TiO2 NFs were prepared by conventional single nozzle electrospinning from solution II, using the same processes and conditions above.
2.3. Fabrication of Ag-decorated TiO2 NFs-interpolated g-C3N4 sheets
TCN-5 had shown the highest photocatalytic activity among the prepared sample, so it was chosen to fabricate the hetero-structured Ag-decorated TiO2 NFs grafted on the g-C3N4 thin sheet. To decorate the Ag NPs on the periphery of the NFs, 20 mg of AgNO3 were added in solution II and stirred at room temperature for 1 h to obtain a stable and homogeneous emulsion, known as solution III. Subsequently, PVAc solution containing g-C3N4 particles (5 wt% relative to the weight of PVAc) and the as-prepared solution III were loaded in two different syringes. The electrospinning process and electrospinning parameters were the same as mentioned above. A schematic diagram to prepare the composite is shown in Scheme 1. After electrospinning, the prepared mat was vacuum dried at 80 °C overnight, and this vacuum dried electrospun mat was also calcined in air at 500 °C for three hours at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1. As mentioned above, the Ti{OCH(CH3)2}4 could decompose into CO2 and H2O. At the same time, the AgNO3 can decompose into Ag atoms, NO2 and O2. With CO2, H2O, NO2 and O2 escaping rapidly, only the TiO2 NFs, Ag atoms and g-C3N4 sheets remained. At a high temperature, the Ag atoms self-assembled into Ag NPs, while the TiO2 molecules could react and generate anatase/rutile-TiO2. Thus, the silver NPs decorated with TiO2 NFs grafted on the g-C3N4 sheet were prepared, and the as-prepared nanostructure is denoted using Ag/TCN-5. For comparison, Ag decorated TiO2 NFs were also prepared by conventional single nozzle electrospinning from solution III, keeping the same parameters and processes as mentioned above.

2.4. Characterization
Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, Hitachi S-7400, Hitachi, Japan) was used to examine the morphology of the different as-prepared samples. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-2200, JEOL, Japan) was similarly used, to observe the interlayer structure of the composite. The crystal phase composition and the crystallinity of the samples were obtained from the X-ray diffraction patterns by using a Rigaku X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Rigaku, Japan) with Cu Kα (λ = 1.540 Å) radiation, and data was obtained in the range from 20 to 80°. The Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were recorded using an ABB Bomen MB100 Spectrometer (Bomen, Canada), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was acquired using a Thermo ESXALAB250 spectrometer. To find out the percentage of Ag NPs in the Ag/TCN-5 sample, 40 ppm solution of the composite was prepared by dissolving it in nitric acid and hydrochloric acid at a proportion of 3:1, and was analyzed via inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS). The specific surface area was determined using multipoint Brunauer, Emmett and Teller (BET) analysis and pore size was measured by the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method of adsorption using ASAP 2010 V5.02H software. The room-temperature photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the samples were recorded using a luminescence spectrometer (LS 55; Perkin-Elmer Inc., USA) with a Xe lamp, which provides information on the recombination rate of the photogenerated carriers.
2.5. Photocatalytic measurement
PR and RB solutions were used as a model dye to evaluate the photocatalytic activity of the prepared samples. As is typical, aqueous solution dyes (30 mg, 10 mg l−1) and a photocatalyst (20 mg) was placed in a 100 ml beaker and was kept in the dark while stirring to ensure adsorption/desorption equilibrium. Then, the photoreaction vessel was irradiated under natural sunlight. At a given time interval, 1 ml of the solution was taken out, centrifuged and filtered to remove the photocatalyst. The suspension was continuously stirred using a magnetic stirrer bar during irradiation. Then, the concentration of the dyes was analyzed using an UV-Vis spectrophotometer. The following equation was used to take into account the degradation rate,  where, CO is the initial concentration and C is the concentration after “t” minutes of irradiation. In the reusability experiment, the recovered photocatalyst was centrifuged, filtered and dried. The dried composite was then used for the next run after making up for the lost portion with fresh solution. All the experiments were conducted during sunny days in Jeonju, South Korea.
2.6. Antibacterial property
The antibacterial activity of the as-prepared nanocomposites was also tested. In this study, Gram-negative Escherichia coli (E. coli) (ATCC 52922) and Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) (ATCC 29231) bacteria were used for the model organism. Both the turbidimetric and zone inhibition method were used to determine the antibacterial properties of the as-prepared samples. In brief, the bacteria were cultured in Luria–Bertani (LB) broth (pH 7.2) at 37 °C for 8 h, and pellets were washed twice with isotonic saline. Finally, the bacterial cell suspensions were diluted in order to maintain the initial concentration of the cells at 107 CFU ml−1. Then, the obtained bacterial cells (107 CFU ml−1) were inoculated in each 5 ml of Luria–Bertani (LB) broth and were incubated with 400 μg ml−1 tested samples at 37 °C and 150 rpm for 8 h using a shaking incubator. For control, the isotonic solutions without a sample in the LB Broth containing E. coli and S. aureus were used. After 8 h of incubation, the optical density of each sample was measured at 600 nm in order to obtain the viabilities of the bacteria using a Sunrise™ Microplate reader (Tecan, Austria) set with LB broth as blank. The cell viability of the bacterial cell in each sample was expressed as a percentage of that of control (untreated). Furthermore, a zone inhibition method was also carried out to measure antibacterial properties against E. coli. Briefly, 100 μl of cell suspension (107 CFU ml−1) were spread on an LB agar plate. An appropriate amount of the as-prepared samples was then gently placed on the LB agar plate, and the plates were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. The zone of inhibition was then determined by measuring the clear area with no bacterial growth that had formed around each sample, and the results were recorded.
3. Results and discussion
The XRD patterns of the g-C3N4, TiO2, Ag/TiO2, TCN-5 and Ag/TCN-5 are shown in Fig. 1. For comparison, the XRD patterns of the g-C3N4, TiO2, and different TCN-x samples are given in ESI (Fig. S1†). The synthesized TiO2 NFs, Ag/TiO2, TCN-5 and Ag/TCN-5 composites are observed to exhibit similar diffraction patterns. The figure reveals that most of the diffraction peaks for pure TiO2 correspond to the anatase phase of TiO2, and the diffraction peak of pure g-C3N4 emerging at 27.4° matches that of the (0 0 2) plane, which corresponds to the stacking of a conjugative aromatic system.28 The peaks of TiO2 at around 25.3°, 37.8°, 38.58°, 37.8°, 47.9°, 53.89°, 55.06°, 62.7°, 68.7°, 70.3° and 75.0° are attributed to the (1 0 1), (0 0 4), (1 1 2), (2 0 0), (1 0 5), (2 1 1), (2 0 4), (1 1 6), (2 2 0) and (2 1 5) lattice plane of anatase TiO2 (JCPDS, 21-1272). The peaks around 27.5°, 41.2° and 56.7° are attributed to the (1 1 0), (1 1 1) and (2 2 0) lattice plane of rutile TiO2 (JCPDS 75-1755).31 No typical peaks of g-C3N4 appeared in the Ag/TCN-5 composite, which may be due to the low weight loading of g-C3N4. Correspondingly, no typical peaks of Ag appeared in Ag/TiO2 and Ag/TCN-5 composites, which also due to low loading of Ag NPs. The percentage of Ag NPs was found as 3.1% from ICP-MS test in the Ag/TCN-5 composite.
 Fig. 1  XRD pattern of g-C3N4 (a), TiO2 (b), TCN-5 (c), Ag/TiO2 (d), and Ag/TCN-5 (e). 
The FT-IR spectrograms of g-C3N4, TiO2, Ag/TiO2, TCN-5 and Ag/TCN-5 are shown in Fig. 2. Correspondingly, the FT-IR spectrograms of the g-C3N4, TiO2, and different TCN-x samples are shown in ESI (Fig. S2†). For pure TiO2 NFs, the Ti–O–Ti stretching vibration mode is assigned by the broad band at around 500 to 800 cm−1. In addition, the peak around 3400 cm−1 for TiO2 corresponds to the stretching vibration mode of the O–H bonds for free water molecules and Ti–OH and N–H vibration for NH4+ ions.32 For pure g-C3N4, three characteristics absorption region were discovered at around 3200 cm−1, 1200–1650 cm−1, and 809 cm−1. Several strong bands were found within 1200–1650 cm−1, which corresponds to the typical stretching mode of aromatic CN heterocycles.33 The peaks around 1640, 1462 and 1407 cm−1 are assigned to the stretching vibration modes of heptazine-derived repeating units, and in addition, the peaks at 1316 and 1240 cm−1 are assigned to the characteristic stretching vibration of C–N(–C)–C.34 Similarly, the broad adsorption band centered at 3188 cm−1 for carbon nitride initiates from the stretching vibration of the N–H bond associated with an uncondensed amino group. The strong absorption at 809 cm−1 could be attributed to the striazine ring system.35 As expected, all main characteristic absorption peaks for TiO2 and g-C3N4 coexisted in terms of the TCN-5 composites. Moreover, when compared with the peak at around 3400 cm−1 for pure TiO2, a slight shift of this peak to a higher wavelength value was observed in TCN-5, suggesting an intense interaction between the TiO2 and g-C3N4. Similarly, all main characteristic peaks of TiO2, g-C3N4 also coexisted in the Ag/TCN-5 composite. Moreover, peak heights of TCN-5 changed after loading of Ag NPs, which may be the presence of Ag NPs. However, as was with the XRD patterns, no typical Ag peaks appeared in the Ag/TCN-5 and Ag/TiO2 samples due to low loading.

Fig. 3 shows FE-SEM images of the different samples. The morphology and the basic properties of g-C3N4 are given in the ESI (Fig. S3 and Table S1†). The FE-SEM images for electrospun TTIP/PVAc NFs and pure TiO2 NFs after calcinations indicated a continuous 1D structure. However, pure TiO2 NFs exhibited a mere decrease in average diameter when compared to the NFs before calcinations, as indicated in Fig. 3a and b. This decrease in size of the NFs was caused by the removal of polymer (PVAc) by calcinations at a high temperature of 500 °C. The fibers with two different diameters can be distinguished in the composite electrospun mat from the two-nozzle electrospinning; the larger diameter fibers may be fibers of g-C3N4/PVAc and smaller diameter fibers are fibers consisting of TTIP/PVAc, as demonstrated in Fig. 3c. During electrospinning, large g-C3N4 sheets are attached on the electrospun mat. Fig. 3d shows that, porous TiO2 NFs are attached on the g-C3N4 sheet after calcinations with a realistic homogeneous behavior. The attached NFs have a length of several micrometers, but the diameter varies from 40 nm up to 150 nm. In comparison to the NPs, such NFs with a considerable length encourage direct and sufficient contact with g-C3N4 sheet, resulting in less agglomeration and hence, further boost the photo degradation efficiency. The FE-SEM image of electrospun g-C3N4/PVAc and TTIP/PVAc modified by AgNO3 from two-angled nozzle electrospinning revealed the same fiber morphology of g-C3N4/PVAc and TTIP/PVAc (Fig. 3e). Similarly, FE-SEM images of the TCN-5 modified by Ag NPs (Ag/TCN-5) also did not reveal any noticeable changes in the fiber morphology (Fig. 3f). Insets of Fig. 3d and f show the porous structure of TiO2 fibers after calcinations. Due to the very small size (<10 nm), the Ag NPs attached on the surface of the TiO2 NFs could not be seen clearly.

TEM and HR-TEM images at different magnification were used to ensure the fixedness of the Ag NPs that are actually present in the TiO2 NFs attached on the g-C3N4 sheets, and the results are illustrated in Fig. 4. The TEM image from TCN-5 clearly demonstrates the TiO2 NFs attached on the g-C3N4 sheet (Fig. 4a). The Ag/TiO2 NFs shows that small Ag NPs were distributed on the TiO2 NFs so that the color of the NFs becomes darker than pure TiO2 NFs (Fig. 4b). Low and high magnification TEM images of TCN-5 after the addition of the Ag NPs are shown in Fig. 4c and d, respectively. The low magnification image shown in Fig. 4c clearly indicates the effect on the NFs presence of the Ag NPs. The color of the TiO2 NFs becomes also darker due to the decoration of Ag NPs on the surface of the NFs. Moreover, a high magnification TEM image of the Ag/TCN-5 (Fig. 4d) sample more clearly confirms the presence of Ag NPs with a size of less than 10 nm. The HR-TEM image (Fig. 4e) clearly indicates the intimate interference of the Ag, TiO2 and g-C3N4 in the composite sample. As shown in Fig. 4e, a clear lattice fringe of interplanar spacing at about 0.23 nm is observed in the darker area, which is very close to the (1 1 1) planes of Ag. Moreover, a cloudy lattice fringe with spacing of about 0.235 nm is observed in less dark area, which is close to the (0 0 1) plane of TiO2. TEM and HR-TEM images given in the ESI† further confirmed the adhesion of the Ag NPs to the surface of the TiO2 NFs (Fig. S4†). The electron beam can pass more easily through the g-C3N4 due to its low atomic weight, so the light area can be determined to consist of g-C3N4, where it is very difficult to observe the lattice fringe.

The XPS spectrum of TCN-5 and Ag/TCN-5 was carried out in order to further evaluate the chemical status and the surface chemical composition of the elements (Fig. 5). The XPS survey spectrum of the TCN-5 sample reveals that it contains only Ti, O, C and N elements. As expected, the Ag/TCN-5 sample contains Ag (Fig. 5a). The high-resolution XPS spectra for Ag/TCN-5 were also obtained. The high-resolution XPS spectra of C 1s demonstrates a peak with a binding energy of around 285 eV (Fig. 5b), which is attributed to defect-containing sp2 hybridized carbon atoms in g-C3N4.36,37 Fig. 5c, shows the high-resolution XPS spectrum of the Ag 3d region. This region fit into two peaks, with peaks around 365.02 and 371.04 belonging to Ag 3d3/2 and Ag 3d5/2, respectively. The N 1s high-resolution XPS spectrum illustrated in Fig. 5d consists of a peak around 397 eV, which is assigned to CN–C.29 In addition, the Ti 2p peaks located at 459.4 eV and 464.3 eV correspond to the Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 (Fig. 5e).37,38 The peak situated around 527 eV in O 1s can be ascribed to the oxygen anions in the lattice (Ti–O–Ti) (Fig. 5f).30

Fig. 6 shows the UV-vis absorption spectra of the TiO2, g-C3N4, Ag/TiO2, TCN-5 and Ag/TCN-5 composites. As can be seen clearly in the figure, the absorption intensity of the pure g-C3N4 sheet occurs at a wavelength greater than 450 nm, which is in good correspondence with the band gap of g-C3N4 (∼2.7 eV). However, the absorption wavelength of the synthesized TiO2 NFs is of less than 400 nm, which is consistent with the intrinsic band gap of anatase TiO2 (∼3.18 eV), which means that it could only have a response to UV light. For comparison, UV-vis absorption spectra of different TCN-x samples are given in ESI (Fig. S5†). Fig. S5† clearly reveals that the absorption edge of all TCN-x samples shifts extremely to a longer wavelength in comparison to the pure TiO2 NFs. The TCN-5 and Ag/TiO2 composite shows obvious absorption in the range from 390 to 475 nm with an absorption edge that occurs at about 460 nm for TCN-5 and 475 nm for Ag/TiO2, clearly indicating enhanced absorption in the visible light region due to the existence of TiO2 NFs on the surface of the g-C3N4 sheets in the case of TCN-5 composite and decoration of Ag NPs on the surface TiO2 NFs in the case of Ag/TiO2 NFs. When compared to pure TiO2 NFs, Ag/TiO2 NFs and TCN-5, the ternary composite of the hetero-structured Ag/TCN-5 has a remarkable red shift toward the absorption of visible-light, where the absorption edge occurs at around 490 nm. It is commendable to note that unattached TiO2 NFs express absorption in the UV light region, while Ag-decorated TiO2 NFs attached on g-C3N4 sheets demonstrate absorption in the visible light region. Thus, the Ag/TCN-x composites can powerfully boost the absorption region of the solar spectrum, which is necessary to achieve a realistic application of photocatalysts under solar light.

Fig. 7 illustrates the degradation curve of PR with different photocatalysts under natural sunlight. Before irradiation under sunlight, the catalysts were mixed with PR solution and stirred for 20 min in the dark to achieve adsorption/desorption equilibrium. Photodegradation was then measured in 5 min intervals, and the concentration of PR in the solution was plotted as a function of the irradiation time, as shown in Fig. 7a. The photocatalytic performance of the different as-prepared composites over PR could also be confirmed in the photographs shown in Fig. 7b. On the basis of the blank experiment, no recognizable PR degradation was observed, or was almost negligible. For pure TiO2 and g-C3N4, only around 18% and 25% degraded within 30 min respectively, indicating the poor photocatalysis of PR in these cases. The as-prepared Ag/TiO2 and TCN-x composites exhibit remarkably better degradation efficiency when compared to pure TiO2 and g-C3N4. Among all TCN-x composites, TCN-5 exhibited an improved photocatalytic activity. Furthermore, a comparison with TCN-5 composite and Ag/TiO2 NFs indicate that, the ternary hetero-structured Ag/TCN-5 composite achieved a maximum photocatalytic performance, while PR had been almost quantitatively degraded within 30 min. Moreover, the photocatalytic degradation activity of the prepared samples was also tested using RB as an organic dye. During the degradation test of RB, all conditions and processes were the same as for the PR degradation test. Fig. 8 illustrates the degradation curve for RB with pristine TiO2, pure g-C3N4, Ag/TiO2, TCN-5 and Ag/TCN-5 under natural sun light irradiation. The curve shows that among all samples, Ag/TCN-5 shows the highest degradation activity, in which RB had been completely degraded around 15 min. Thus, the photocatalytic degradation results showed that the as-prepared Ag/TCN-5 composite can be used for different organic compounds.

The Langmuir–Hinshelwood model is primarily used to evaluate the kinetics of the photocatalytic degradation of different organic compounds in aqueous solutions.39 Their model basically relates the concentration of reactants in water at time t (c) and the degradation rate (r), which is expressed as,40  where, Kr is the rate constant and Kad is the adsorption equilibrium constant. When the adsorption is relatively weak and the reactants concentration is low in a photocatalytic reaction, the photocatalytic reaction equation can be simplified to a pseudo-first order equation with an apparent first-order rate constant (Kapp), as expressed in following equation,  where, CO is the initial concentration of the substrate. Fig. 9a and b shows a linear relationship between ln(CO/C) and the irradiation time with Kapp for different samples. The Kapp value shows that the reaction rate for Ag/TCN-5 is highest than those of the other samples in both dyes, which is consistent with the results that were previously discussed for the photocatalytic activity.

The PL spectra of different samples that excited at 210 nm were recorded in order to further assess the migration, transfer and recombination process of photogenerated e–h pairs. The lower PL intensity indicates an inferior recombination rate for the e–h pairs, which is crucial to improve the photocatalytic activity. Fig. 10 displayed the PL spectra for the TiO2, g-C3N4, Ag/TiO2, TCN-5 and Ag/TCN-5 samples. Pure g-C3N4 exhibits a high intensity emission peak at around 480 nm, which can be ascribed to the band–band PL phenomenon with a light energy that is approximately equal to the band gap energy of g-C3N4. This band–band PL signal is a result of the n → π* electronic transition involving lone pairs of nitrogen atoms in g-C3N4.24 Similarly, TiO2 exhibits the PL intensity in the wavelength range of 300–700 nm. The first peak of TiO2 in the PL spectra around 370 nm is due to the direct recombination between electrons in the conduction band and holes in the valence band.41 Additionally, the PL spectrum peak around 480 nm and 530 nm is attributed to the surface oxygen vacancies and related defects.37 Photo-induced electrons are attached by these oxygen vacancies and defects to form excitons, so that PL signal can occur easily.42 The PL intensity increases with the increasing content of such oxygen vacancies and defects. As expected, intensity decreases for the Ag/TiO2 and TCN-5 composite. Moreover, the intensity of the peak further decreases after introducing the Ag NPs into the TCN-5 sample. This reveals an Ag/TCN-5 composite with a lower recombination rate of e–h pairs under irradiation with visible-light.

It is well known that the improvement the photodegradation activity of composite materials mainly transfers electrons and holes effectively at the photocatalyst interface. We should notice that the formation of hetero-structures between TiO2 and g-C3N4 is one of the major reasons for the improvement in the photocatalytic performance due to the increase in separation efficiency of the charge carriers. The conduction band (CB) edge potential of g-C3N4 is more negative than that of the CB edge of TiO2. Therefore, the photoinduced electron on g-C3N4 under visible-light irradiation can be easily transferred from the CB of g-C3N4 to the CB edge of TiO2. Thus, the main degradation process was obtained on the surface of TiO2, and the dissolved O2 and pollutant molecules had to travel through the outer layer composed of g-C3N4. In the case of Ag/TiO2 NFs under visible light irradiation, the Ag NPs were excited due to their surface plasmon resonance.43 Therefore, the photogeneration of e–h pairs occurs on the surface of Ag NPs nearby TiO2 NFs. The advantages of forming e–h pairs near the TiO2 NFs is that these charge carriers are readily separated from each other and easily transferred from Ag to TiO2 NFs through the close interface between them.44,45 These injected electrons are trapped by dissolved oxygen molecules in water to yield a high oxidative species (˙O2 and ˙OH), which are responsible for the photocatalytic degradation activity. In the case of the ternary hetero-junction structure Ag/TCN-5, the Ag NPs decorated on the surface of the TiO2 NFs played an important role in the electron-conduction conduit, which can promote charge carrier separation and a remarkable increase in photocatalytic performance. Fig. 11 demonstrates a schematic diagram of photo-induced charge transfer, charge separation and degradation process of PR and RB in the ternary hetero-junction structure of Ag/TCN-5. The charge separation in g-C3N4 and the electron transfer toward TiO2 would be more efficient due to the formation of a Schottky barrier at the Ag and TiO2 interface after decorating TiO2 NFs with the Ag NPs.46 The photo-induced electron of g-C3N4 after irradiation with visible light directionally migrates to the TiO2 NFs through the Ag NPs due to the close interfacial connection between the Ag/TiO2 and g-C3N4, where the recombination of photoinduced electron and holes is retarded, resulting in an improvement in the separation efficiency of the e–h pairs. Moreover, the surface plasmon resonance of the Ag NPs can improve the irradiation of visible light. All of the results above indicate that the as-prepared Ag/TCN-5 composite has a better photocatalytic performance to degrade different dyes than that of g-C3N4, TiO2 and TCN-x composites. Here, the synergistic effect that existed among the Ag, TiO2 and g-C3N4 should also play a crucial role in encouraging e–h pair separation for improving the photocatalytic activity.

The photocatalytic stability test for Ag/TCN-5 was conducted by repeating the degradation four times. During the stability test, the catalyst was centrifuged and filtered off from the solution, and then the filtered catalyst was dried for 24 hours and used for the next run, making up for the lost portion. The degradation efficiency of the Ag/TCN-5 catalyst over the same concentration of PR solution for different cycle times is shown in Fig. 12, where the figure reveals that the degradation capacity decreased from 92.5% to 84.3% after four repeating cycles, demonstrating a satisfactory stability of the catalyst. Moreover, FT-IR patterns were used to further investigate the stability of commercial g-C3N4. Fig. 13 clearly illustrates that the FT-IR patterns of g-C3N4 after four cyclic runs had not changed appreciably compared to the fresh one. This result hints that the effectiveness of g-C3N4 was stable during the photocatalytic reactions.

The antibacterial properties against Gram-negative E. coli and Gram-positive S. aureus of the different as-prepared samples were assessed via turbidimetric method. Fig. 14 shows the growth graph of E. coli and S. aureus in the presence and absence of the photocatalyst for the turbidimetric method. Here, the bacteria that remain in the absence of photocatalyst served as control. The optical density has been observed to be almost the same as that of control after treatment with g-C3N4, showing negligible antibacterial activity. However, a decrease in optical density was observed in the presence of the TiO2 NFs, and furthermore, the antibacterial activity slightly increased when the solution was treated with TCN-5. Moreover, Ag/TiO2 NFs showed enhanced antibacterial activity compared to TCN-5. When compared to single-component and two-component samples, the figure reveals that the ternary composite of the hetero-structured Ag/TCN-5 has the best antibacterial properties against both bacteria. In addition, the antibacterial activity of the different samples was further evaluated using the zone of inhibition (ZOI) test against the E. coli bacteria. Fig. 15 shows the ZOI test for different samples. The antibacterial activity of the different samples was evaluated by measuring a clear area around the samples. The g-C3N4 did not show any measurable clear area around the sample, suggesting negligible antibacterial properties. The clear area (ZOIs) obtained around the samples followed the order of Ag/TCN-5 > Ag/TiO2 > TCN-5 > TiO2 > g-C3N4, which is consistent with the results of the turbidimetric method. The photocatalytic process for TiO2 generates various reactive oxygen species including hydroxyl radicals, hydrogen peroxide, and superoxide.47 Among these reactive oxygen species, some species are directly involved in destroying the outer membrane of the bacteria cells causing serious damage to the microorganism. Moreover, the microorganism carries a negative charge while the metal oxide carries a positive charge, and this causes an electromagnetic attraction between the metal oxide and the microorganism that leads to oxidation and finally death of the microorganism.48 Several previous results indicate that the antibacterial effect that is observed is due to the photocatalytic activity of the photocatalysts in suspension.47,49 Therefore, the attachment of TiO2 porous NFs on the surface of the g-C3N4 sheet reduces the possibility of recombination, leading to an improvement in the antibacterial activity. Ag/TiO2 NFs showed enhanced antibacterial activity than TCN-5. This is due to the presence of Ag NPs on the surface of TiO2 NFs. Among all samples in both methods, the Ag/TCN-5 showed an improvement in the antibacterial due to the presence of the Ag NPs that were decorated on the porous TiO2 NFs. The enhanced antibacterial activity of Ag/TCN-5 is directly related to the Ag NPs that were decorated on the NFs wall. Generally, there are two different theories for killing the bacteria by Ag NPs. As per the first theory, Ag NPs can react with water and release Ag ions. These released Ag ions combine with sulphydryl in bacteria, resulting in the obstructing of breathing and ultimately the death of the bacteria. Similarly other theory explains that the oxygen dissolved in water reacts with Ag ions, that generates activated oxygen which can decay the bacteria.50 Moreover, doping of Ag NPs on the wall of the TiO2 NFs increases the value of the e–h charge separation by decreasing the band-gap energy and lead to suppress the recombination rate and improve the antibacterial activity. The possible killing mechanism of the microorganisms by Ag NPs was also explained clearly in our previous research.28 Our result (Fig. 14) showed that the antibacterial properties of the as-prepared samples were better against E. coli compared to S. aureus, which is consistent with the previous results.50 This improved antibacterial activity against Gram-negative may be explained in terms of the specific structure of the bacteria cell wall. It has been reported that the Gram-positive bacteria containing many layers of peptidoglycan and teichoic acids which makes its cell wall thicker compared to Gram-negative. Moreover, Gram-positive bacteria recognized to be more resistive than Gram-negative bacteria in photocatalytic activity. Hence, Gram-positive bacteria should be attacked by the higher number of hydroxyl radicals to get complete inactivation.51–53

4. Conclusions
In summary, ternary hetero-structures of porous TiO2 NFs decorated with Ag NPs grafted on a large-surface-area g-C3N4 sheet were synthesized using a one-step method via simple and facile electrospinning–calcination process. During this process, TiO2/g-C3N4 composites with different wt% of g-C3N4 were first prepared. Then the resulting composite which showed enhanced photocatalytic degradation activity among them (TCN-5), was used for making hetero-structured of Ag, TiO2 and g-C3N4 (Ag/TCN-5). The different characterizations indicate that an intimate contact exists between the Ag-decorated TiO2 NFs and the g-C3N4 sheets. Moreover, only Ag decorated TiO2 NFs were also prepared for comparison purpose. The combined advantages due to the unique properties of the NPs, porous NFs and sheet-like structure result in a ternary hetero-structure with enhanced photocatalytic activity under natural sunlight. Here, Ag NPs decorated on the surface of TiO2 NFs play an important role as an electron-conduction conduit that suppresses the e–h recombination and promotes charge carrier separation, which ultimately improves the photocatalytic performance for degrading Phenol Red and Reactive Black compared with pristine TiO2 and g-C3N4 and single-component modified Ag/TiO2 and TiO2/g-C3N4 composites. We also explored the antibacterial properties of the different samples and found greatly enhanced antibacterial activities of Ag/TCN-5 against both Gram negative E. coli and Gram-positive S. aureus compared with g-C3N4, TiO2, TCN-5 and Ag/TiO2. The mechanism implies that the released Ag ions are expected to have enhanced the antibacterial activity of the composites. Thus, our results suggest that this new hybrid Ag/TCN-5 composite may facilitate water disinfection using visible light as well as antibacterial materials for purifying waste water contaminated with pathogenic microorganisms.
