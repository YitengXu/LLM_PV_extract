Their structures and morphologies were characterized using XRD and SEM, and the photovoltaic and catalytic performance based on those prepared hierarchical Cu2ZnSnS4 nanostructures as counter electrode (CE) materials in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) was investigated. Results indicated that the photovoltaic and catalytic performance of DSSCs depend on the microstructures and morphologies of the electrodes, and the sample with monodisperse nanoparticle structure as CE yielded an overall light conversion efficiency of 6.98% with a fill factor of 66.0%, a short circuit current of 14.26 mA cm−2 and an open circuit voltage of 0.74 V, which were comparable with those of Pt (η = 6.91%) under the same device configuration.1. IntroductionAs traditional thin-film solar cells, although CdTe and Cu(InGa)Se2 (CIGS) have already reached the commercialisation stage, they are limited by restrictions on the use of Cd and by insufficient supplies of In and Te. Copper zinc tin sulphide (Cu2ZnSnS4, CZTS) has attracted attention as a promising substitute material for these traditional thin-film solar cells because of its direct band gap (1.4 eV to 1.5 eV), large absorption coefficient (104 cm−1), cost effectiveness, high efficiency and environment friendliness.1–3 In fact, since the pioneering work by the IBM team of Mitzi and co-workers,4–6 there has been a heightened interest in developing CZTS light absorber layer for thin film solar cells7–10 and a power conversion efficiency record of 11.1% has been achieved using a Cu2ZnSn(Se,S)4 thin-film solar cell. Furthermore, CZTS has also been reported as an effective counter electrode (CE) that can replace expensive Pt in DSSCs and quantum dot sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs), and a power conversion efficiency of 7.37% was achieved by spin coating CZTS followed by selenisation.11–14 However, the CE performance of Cu2ZnSnS4 films without selenisation still remains at a relatively lower level. So far, numerous studies focused on the fabrication and development of various solar cells based on CZTS materials,15–20 however, research on the effect of material morphology on performance has rarely been reported in the literature.The aim of this paper is to prepare Cu2ZnSnS4 with a variety of morphologies using a hydrothermal process, and to explore the effect of its morphologies on the performance as CE in DSSCs after calcination under different conditions without further selenisation.2. Experimental2.1. Synthesis of Cu2ZnSnS4 powderCu2ZnSnS4 powder was prepared by a solvothermal method. Reagent-grade CuCl2·2H2O, ZnCl2, SnCl4·2H2O, thiourea and polyvinylpyrrolidone were weighed in stoichiometric amounts of Cu2ZnSnS4 and dissolved in ethylene glycol with stirring to achieve final Zn2+ concentrations of 0.005, 0.02, and 0.05 M. Then, the mixture was transferred into a Teflon-lined autoclave with an internal volume of 100 mL and maintained at 200 °C for 48 h. After the reaction, the precipitate was collected by centrifugation, rinsed and then dried overnight at 60 °C in a vacuum oven.2.2. Fabrication of solar cellThe as-prepared Cu2ZnSnS4 powder was dispersed in 10 mL of isopropanol and milled with 10 g of zirconia beads for 4 h to form a uniform ‘ink’. The ‘ink’ was then spray-casted onto a clean fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrate with a spray area of 8 × 8 mm2. The films were completely dried and then annealed at 300 °C in air and at 500 °C under N2 atmosphere and saturated sulphur vapour for 2 h. Pt CE was fabricated by depositing Pt particles onto the FTO glass substrate using a sputtering instrument (PMC-5000 Plasma multi coater). DSSCs with an active area of 0.16 cm2 were fabricated with a photoanode (a TiO2 film sensitized by N719, Solaronix, Switzerland), a CE and an electrolyte containing 0.06 M LiI, 0.6 M 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide, 0.03 M I2, 0.5 M 4-tert-butyl pyridine and 0.1 M guanidinium thiocyanate in acetonitrile. The symmetrical dummy cell (active area of 0.25 cm2) used in Tafel-polarization test and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) experiments was assembled by two identical electrodes filling the electrolyte similar to the one used in fabricating DSSCs.2.3. Characterization and measurementThe crystal structure was examined by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD, M18XCE, Cu Kα radiation, λ = 1.54056 Å). The morphologies and microstructures were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi HF-2000). BET measurement (JW-BK) was performed to determine the specific surface areas. The I–V curves of the DSSCs were obtained in simulated AM 1.5 illumination (100 mW cm−2, Peccell, PEC-L15) with a Keithley digital source meter (Keithley 2601, USA). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was carried out in a three-electrode system in an argon-purged acetonitrile solution containing 0.1 M LiClO4, 10 mM LiI and 1 mM I2 at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1, with Pt as a CE and Ag/Ag+ as a reference electrode using a BAS 100 B/W electrochemical analyser. EIS measurements were performed using an impedance spectrum analyzer (Zahner IM6e) within the frequency range of 0.1 Hz to 106 Hz and the alternative signal magnitude of 10 mV. Thales software packed with Zahner IM6eX was employed to fit the impedance.3. Results and discussion3.1. Crystal structuresFig. 1 illustrates the XRD patterns of the Cu2ZnSnS4 powders solvothermally prepared at 200 °C for 48 h with Zn2+ concentrations of 0.005, 0.02 and 0.05 M (labelled as samples (a), (b) and (c), respectively) and the corresponding spray-coated Cu2ZnSnS4 films of sample (c) calcined in air atmosphere at (d) 300 °C, (e) in N2 atmosphere and (f) saturated sulphur vapour at 500 °C for 2 h. As shown in Fig. 1a–c, all diffraction peaks of the as-synthesised Cu2ZnSnS4 powders can be indexed to the pure phase of Cu2ZnSnS4 (JCPDS no. 26-0575), indicating the absence of impurities. The major XRD diffraction peaks appeared at 2θ values of 28.52, 33.08, 47.64, and 56.60, which correspond to the (112), (200), (220), and (312) planes. Generally, losses of Sn and S observed during film fabrication of Cu2ZnSnS4 can be attributed to surface decomposition under high temperature conditions.21 Therefore, calcination conditions significantly affect the structure and phase of the films (Fig. 1d–f). As shown in Fig. 1f, the spray-coated Cu2ZnSnS4 film calcined in saturated sulphur vapour at 500 °C retained its complete Cu2ZnSnS4 structure. In the other two cases, the diffraction intensity decreased, and some impurities were also observed. These results indicate that saturated sulphur vapour at 500 °C is the most suitable condition for the fabrication of pure Cu2ZnSnS4 films. Fig. 1  XRD patterns of the Cu2ZnSnS4 powders solvothermally prepared at 200 °C for 48 h with Zn2+ concentrations of (a) 0.005, (b) 0.02 and (c) 0.05 M, and the spray-coated Cu2ZnSnS4 films calcined in air (d) at 300 °C, (e) in N2 atmosphere and (f) saturated sulphur vapour at 500 °C for 2 h. 3.2. MorphologyFig. 2 shows the typical SEM images of the Cu2ZnSnS4 powders solvothermally prepared at 200 °C for 48 h with Zn2+ concentrations of (a) 0.005, (b) 0.02 and (c) 0.05 M. The resulting spray-casted Cu2ZnSnS4 films calcined in saturated sulphur vapour at 500 °C for 2 h with Zn2+ concentrations of (d) 0.005, (e) 0.02 and (f) 0.05 M, as well as their corresponding cross-sectional images (f), (h), (i) are also shown in Fig. 2. At 0.005 M Zn2+, a nearly flower-like Cu2ZnSnS4 hierarchical nanostructure with an average diameter of approximately 2 μm was obtained and a similar result has been reported in the literatures.16,19 However, at (b) 0.02 M Zn2+, a structure with a mixture of hierarchical rods, hierarchical spheres and particles was observed and at (c) 0.05 M Zn2+, nearly uniform monodisperse nanoparticles with average diameters ranging from 50 nm to 60 nm were obtained. Therefore, surface morphology is largely influenced by the concentration of the starting materials, and uniform nanoparticles can be obtained at a high Zn2+ concentration (i.e., 0.05 M). And the corresponding specific surface areas of samples (a), (b) and (c) were determined by BET measurement as 29.8, 21.3 and 128.5 m2 g−1 respectively, from this result, it can be seen that the nanoparticles owns the largest specific surface areas, which will be of benefit to the following photovoltaic performance. As shown in Fig. 2d–f, most of the calcined spray-casted Cu2ZnSnS4 films retained their initial morphology and porous structure, except for sample (a), in which hierarchical nanoflowers were decomposed into nanoflakes. Furthermore, the film thickness (approximately 2 μm) of the calcined Cu2ZnSnS4 layers for the three spray-coated samples can be obtained from cross-sectional SEM images (Fig. 2g–i). As shown in the figures, the same spray amount of ‘ink’ produced uniform film thickness ranging from 2.0 μm to 2.3 μm. The slight difference in thickness maybe resulting from the different morphologies will have very slight effect on the latter photovoltaic and catalytic performance. Fig. 2  SEM images of the solvothermally prepared Cu2ZnSnS4 powders at 200 °C for 48 h with Zn2+ concentrations of (a) 0.005, (b) 0.02 and (c) 0.05 M. The corresponding spray-coated Cu2ZnSnS4 films were calcined in saturated sulphur vapour at 500 °C for 2 h with Zn2+ concentrations of (d) 0.005, (e) 0.02 and (f) 0.05 M. Cross-sectional SEM images of the prepared Cu2ZnSnS4 powders (g, h and i). 3.3. Photovoltaic performanceFig. 3 shows the photocurrent density–voltage curves (J–V curves) of DSSCs based on the prepared Cu2ZnSnS4 samples calcined under different conditions as CE materials. The derived photovoltaic parameters, such as short circuit photocurrent (Jsc), open circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF) and η, are summarised in Table 1. Evidently, the same Cu2ZnSnS4 CE treated under three calcination atmospheres resulted in different photovoltaic performances (Fig. 3a, b and d), and the poorer photovoltaic performances for samples (a) and (b) calcined in air and N2 atmospheres can be attributed to the evaporation of Sn and SnS during CZTS film calcinations.22 In addition, the Cu2ZnSnS4 film calcined in saturated sulphur vapour at 500 °C for 2 h exhibited better photovoltaic performance (Fig. 3d), which is consistent with the XRD result. Compared with the Cu2ZnSnS4 CEs calcined under the same conditions (saturated sulphur vapour at 500 °C for 2 h) but with different morphologies (Fig. 3c–e), it can be observed that the photovoltaic performances of the DSSCs were dependent on the microstructures and morphologies of the CEs and the CE (e) exhibited very close Voc and FF values but slightly higher Jsc values in relation to the other two CEs. The results may be attributed to low resistance for charge transport owing to its nanoparticle structure and enhanced solar-to-electrical conversion efficiency (η), which will be further characterized by EIS analysis. Hence, Cu2ZnSnS4 CE with nanoparticle structure possessed the highest efficiency of η = 6.98% with Voc = 0.74 V, Jsc = 14.26 mA cm−2 and FF = 0.66. These parameters are comparable with those of Pt (η = 6.91%) under the same device configuration.

Catalytic performance of Cu2ZnSnS4 as CE materialsCV, EIS and Tafel polarisation measurements were carried out to investigate the effect of morphology on the catalytic activity of Cu2ZnSnS4 CEs. Fig. 4 shows the CVs of the Cu2ZnSnS4 CEs with (a) nanoflower and (b) nanoparticle morphologies together with Pt. Clearly, the profile and location of the relatively negative pairs of the redox peaks of the two types of prepared Cu2ZnSnS4 CEs were similar to those of the Pt electrode, indicating that the electrocatalytic activities for I3 reduction of both electrodes are similar to those of the Pt electrode. However, compared with the Pt electrode, larger peak current responses were observed for both Cu2ZnSnS4 materials, which can be attributed to their higher roughness factors resulting from larger active surface areas and implying high catalytic activities towards the reduction of I−3 and I2. The CV results indicate that Cu2ZnSnS4 is a promising CE catalyst that can replace the expensive Pt in DSSCs. Fig. 4  Cyclic voltammograms for the various Cu2ZnSnS4 counter electrodes prepared with Zn2+ concentrations of (a) 0.005 M and (b) 0.05 M and calcined in saturated sulphur vapour at 500 °C for 2 h together with Pt. Fig. 5 shows the Nyquist plots and the equivalent circuits for the electrochemical cells based on Cu2ZnSnS4 electrodes and Pt. The symmetrical cell based on the prepared Cu2ZnSnS4 had lower Rs values electrodes (10.30 and 12.15 Ω for the samples with (a) nanoflower and (b) nanoparticle structures, respectively) than Pt CE (13.67 Ω), indicating that the prepared Cu2ZnSnS4 film firmly bonded to the substrate and that the nanostructure reduced the Rs value. Both types of Cu2ZnSnS4 electrodes had smaller Rct values (0.40 and 0.44 Ω for samples (a) and (b), respectively) than Pt (4.32 Ω), this result suggests higher electrocatalytic activity and better photovoltaic performance of DSSCs with Cu2ZnSnS4 as CEs, which agrees well with the CV measurements (Fig. 4). Furthermore, according to the right semicircle (assigned to the diffusion resistance impedance (ZN) of the redox couple in the electrolyte), the Cu2ZnSnS4 electrodes with nanoparticle structure exhibited a relatively smaller ZN value (1.54 Ω) than the Cu2ZnSnS4 electrodes with nanoflower structure (ZN = 40.52 Ω) and Pt CEs (ZN = 11.56 Ω). These results demonstrate that the CEs with nanoparticle structure have a high diffusion velocity of triiodide, suggesting the relatively higher photovoltaic performance of the DSSCs using Cu2ZnSnS4 electrodes with nanoparticle structure. Fig. 5  Nyquist plots and the equivalent circuit (insert) for the electrochemical cells fabricated with two identical Cu2ZnSnS4 electrodes prepared with Zn2+ concentrations of (a) 0.005 M and (b) 0.05 M and calcined in saturated sulphur vapour at 500 °C for 2 h together with Pt. Fig. 6 shows the Tafel curves of the symmetrical cells similar to the ones used in the EIS measurement, which can be analyzed using previous studies as references.23,24 The curve of Cu2ZnSnS4 with (b) nanoparticle structure and Pt exhibited a larger slope and a higher Jlim than that of Cu2ZnSnS4 with nanoflower structure. The results indicate that Cu2ZnSnS4 with nanoparticle structure has a high catalytic activity for triiodide electrolytes and a higher diffusion velocity for the redox couple in the electrolyte. These properties account for the relatively higher photovoltaic performance of the sample with nanoparticle structure, which is consistent with the results of EIS. Fig. 6  Tafel polarization curves of the symmetrical cells fabricated with two identical Cu2ZnSnS4 electrodes prepared with Zn2+ concentration of (a) 0.005 M and (b) 0.05 M and calcined in saturated sulphur vapour at 500 °C for 2 h together with Pt. According to the results of CV, EIS and Tafel test, the Cu2ZnSnS4 electrodes with nanoparticle structure exhibited superior catalytic activity for I3 reduction and possessed excellent photovoltaic properties. Therefore, nanostructures with large active surface areas can improve the performance of CEs in DSSCs.4. ConclusionThree types of novel hierarchical Cu2ZnSnS4 structures were successfully prepared by a solvothermal approach. The photovoltaic and catalytic performances of DSSCs were found to be dependent on the microstructures and morphologies of CEs and the nanostructure can improve the performance of the CEs. The use of the prepared Cu2ZnSnS4 nanoparticles as CE yielded an overall light conversion efficiency of 6.98% with a fill factor of 66.0%, a short circuit current of 14.26 mA cm−2 and an open circuit voltage of 0.74 V.AcknowledgementsThis research was financially supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (21201145); Postdoctoral Science Foundation of China (2013M532103) and Open Subject of Key Laboratory of Oil and Gas Fine Chemicals, Ministry of Education and Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, Xinjiang University (XJDX0908-2011-07).ReferencesH.
