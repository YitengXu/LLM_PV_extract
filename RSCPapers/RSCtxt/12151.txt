However, the charge transfer from the triplet state is found to be slow in singlet fission materials, so suppression of the triplet decay is crucial for effective utilization of singlet fission. Here, we first investigated triplet decay for the singlet fission molecular materials of ThBF and TThBF, which are characteristic of twisted and flexible quinoidal backbones. It is found that these compounds show rapid nonradiative decay in the Franck–Condon region and through the T1/S0 crossing point. Interestingly, upon locking the backbone twist by methylene, the LThBF and LTThBF compounds exhibit much higher energy barriers from T1 to the T1/S0 crossing point, vanishing spin–orbit couplings, and decreased reorganization energies due to the planar and rigid structures. Consequently, both the triplet decay pathways are effectively suppressed. Our work reveals the importance of molecular planarity and rigidity in suppressing triplet decay and will be very helpful for full utilization of singlet fission in organic photovoltaics.
Introduction
Singlet fission (SF) is a multiexciton generation process in which one singlet exciton is split into two triplet excitons (Fig. 1).1–3 If the triplet excitons can be effectively dissociated into free charge carriers, SF could double the photocurrents for solar cells. Hence, SF is considered as a potential way to boost the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) and overcome the Shockley–Queisser limit for organic photovoltaics.4,5 This has rekindled the research interest in SF and triggered the studies of applying SF in organic photovoltaic devices.6–15 Based on the classical high-efficiency SF materials, such as pentacene16 and tetracene,17 the covalent dimers and derivatives were designed to investigate the SF mechanisms and the design strategy for new SF materials.18–24 Besides, quinoidal thiophene compounds13,25 and antiaromatic polycyclic hydrocarbons,26 which display diradical characters, were found to have high SF efficiencies. In the photovoltaic devices, some encouraging results have been reported. Over 100% external quantum efficiency (EQE, the extracted electrons per incident photon) was achieved for the first time with pentacene as SF donor and C60 as acceptor, and the device showed about 160% triplet yield and 1.8% PCE.11 After using the light-trapping distributed Bragg reflector, the EQE was further improved to 126% from the previous 106%.11,12 For the devices with the infrared-absorbing PbSe nanocrystals as electron acceptors and pentacene as a SF donor, the PCE reached up to 4.7%,8 and a solution-processed SF solar cell based on TIPS-pentacene/PbS was reported with a PCE of 4.8%.6 The organic photovoltaic device using a 9,9′-bifluorenylidene derivative BThBFN as a SF donor and PC71BM as an electron acceptor achieved a PCE of 1.3%.27 Besides, both experiments and theoretical calculations showed that quinoidal thiophene derivatives (ThBF and TThBF, see Fig. 2a) could serve as SF donors with PDIF-CN2 as an acceptor for organic photovoltaic devices.13,28,29

The T1/S0-MECP geometries are used here to highlight the twist directions of the end fluorene groups for the crossing and parallel configurations of ThBF and TThBF. 
To achieve high-efficiency SF, the excitation energy of the lowest singlet excited state (S1) is required to be twice higher than the excitation energy of the lowest triplet excited state (T1),1 so that the SF process is exoergic and favourable both in kinetics and thermodynamics.3 In addition, the T1 energy needs to be lower than one half of the energy of the second triplet excited state (T2) to avoid the triplet–triplet fusion, too.1 It should be noted that to make full use of SF in solar cells, the dissociation of the T1 excitons must be efficient and surpass their decay to the ground state (S0), as shown in Fig. 1. However, because of the low T1 energies needed to meet the SF energy requirements, the nonradiative decay from T1 to S0 can be very fast.30 Particularly, for the flexible non-fused quinoidal compounds, T1 can easily access the T1/S0 crossing point.31 On the other hand, the T1 exciton dissociation is very dependent on the energy of the charge-transfer state at the donor–acceptor interface;32 especially, the rate constant for charge transfer from the triplet state is found to be surprisingly slow even at the optimal driving force.33 Thus, it is highly desirable to suppress the triplet decay pathways in the singlet fission solar cells.
Here, we have investigated the impact of molecular planarity and rigidity on the T1 decay in a series of quinoidal singlet fission materials (Fig. 2). It is found that for ThBF and TThBF that have twisted and flexible backbones, the T1 excitons decay rapidly both through the Franck–Condon region and the T1/S0 crossing region because of strong spin–orbit couplings and vibronic couplings as well as vanishingly small barriers. Interestingly, for LThBF and LTThBF in which the backbone rotation is locked with methylene, while the SF process is energetically favorable, both the T1 decay pathways through the T1/S0 crossing region and the Franck–Condon region can be effectively suppressed due to the locking effect.
Computational details
For all the compounds, geometry optimizations and frequency analyses were performed using density functional theory (DFT) for S0 and T1, time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) for S1, and TDDFT with Tamm–Dancoff approximation (TDA) for T2.34 In addition, the T1/S0 minimum energy crossing points (MECPs) were optimized by DFT. Charge density differences (CDDs) were obtained based on the vertical excitation at the S0 geometries to describe the transition characters of excited states. To estimate the influence of density functionals, two hybrid functionals with different percentages of Hartree–Fork exchange, B3LYP (20%)35 and M06-2X (54%),36 were adopted in combination with the 6-31G** basis set. Since TDDFT would much underestimate the triplet excitation energies at some geometries due to the triplet instability problem, while TDA can effectively eliminate this error,37 the electronic properties of the triplet states were described by TDA considering the consistency throughout the calculations. Tables S1 and S2 (ESI†) list the T1 and T2 excitation energies calculated by DFT, TDDFT, and TDA with the B3LYP functional. The results show that TDA is a reliable method to describe the triplet excited states. Moreover, we have performed a relaxed scan of the potential energy curves for the S1, T1, and S0 states for the dihedral angles between the central thiophene/bithiophene and the end fluorene groups with the B3LYP functional. All the above calculations were carried out by using the Gaussian 16 package,38 and the T1/S0 MECPs were optimized in conjugation with the sobMECP program.39,40
To investigate the T1 decay, the spin–orbit couplings (SOCs) between T1 and S0 and the phosphorescence oscillator strength (f) were calculated with the linear response method at the TDA-B3LYP/6-31G** level, as implemented in the Beijing Density Functional (BDF) package.41–44 The phosphorescence rate kp can be estimated according to Einstein's spontaneous radiative relation,45 (1)where  (in cm−1) is the vertical emission energy of T1. The intersystem crossing (ISC) rate kisc from T1 to S0 in the Franck–Condon region was calculated by the thermal vibration correlation function (TVCF) formalism under the first-order perturbation theory, (2)Here, ℏ is the reduced Planck constant, HSO is the SOC between T1 and S0 based on the T1 geometry,  is the adiabatic excitation energy of T1, Z−1 is the vibrational partition function, and ρ(t) is the TVCF. The calculations of kisc were performed by MOMAP 1.0.46
Reorganization energy is an important parameter and it is very useful to understand the electronic transition processes; it is defined as the difference between the energies of the final state in the equilibrium geometries of the initial and final states. The reorganization energies for the S0 → T1 process and vice versa are calculated from potential energy surfaces: (3) (4)The reorganization energy can be divided into each normal vibration mode through the frequency ωi and associated Huang–Rhys factor Si, (5) λi = Siℏωi(6) Si = ωiΔQi2/2(7)where ΔQi denotes the displacement between the T1 and S0 geometries along the i-th normal mode coordinate. The normal mode analysis of reorganization energy was carried out by using MOMAP 1.0.
Results and discussion
Geometric and electronic structures
Because of steric hindrance, the backbones of ThBF and TThBF in the ground state (S0) are slightly twisted although the central quinoidal thiophene and the terminal fluorenes are connected by double bonds. Therefore, there are two configurations for these molecules, i.e., crossing ThBF-c and TThBF-c and parallel ThBF-p and TThBF-p, according to the twist directions of the two end groups (Fig. 2). For ThBF, the parallel configuration is slightly more stable, while the crossing configuration is a little more stable for TThBF, but the energy difference is very small (<room temperature energy). Thus, both the crossing and parallel configurations are considered in our study.
The molecular geometries for the S0, S1, T1, and T2 states as well as the T1/S0 MECP were fully optimized without any symmetry restraint for all the compounds. The results show that for each configuration, the geometries of the S0, S1, T1, and T2 states as well as the T1/S0 MECP are of the same symmetry, and the symmetry point groups are given in Fig. 2. For all the compounds, the S1 and T1 excitations are dominated by the transition from the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO). As seen in Fig. 3 and Fig. S1 (ESI†), the HOMOs and LUMOs are delocalized over the whole conjugated backbones, and the orbital energies are hardly affected by the different configurations. Although the HOMO and LUMO energies are relatively higher for LThBF and LTThBF with respect to ThBF and TThBF, the molecules with the same central cores have very close HOMO–LUMO gaps and vertical excitation energies of S1 and T1 (Table S3, ESI†). Compared with the ThBF series, the TThBF series shows higher HOMOs, lower LUMOs, and narrow fundamental gaps as well as smaller S1 and T1 excitation energies due to larger conjugation lengths. The calculated S1 excitation energies for the ThBF and TThBF compounds compare well with the experimental results measured by UV-vis absorption spectra (2.30 and 2.11 eV).13

Upon S1 and T1 excitations, the electron densities are decreased for the double bonds and increased for the single bonds along the quinoidal skeletons (Fig. 3 and Fig. S1, ESI†); consequently, the single bonds are shortened and the double bonds are elongated from the S0 state to the S1 and T1 states. Fig. 4 shows the dihedral angles between the central thiophene/bithiophene and the end fluorene groups (see Fig. 2a) in the optimized geometries for the unlocked compounds of ThBF and TThBF. The dihedral angles in the S0 geometries are calculated to be 10–12°, which are in good agreement with the experimental values of ca. 10° in the single crystals.13 Owing to the elongated and weakened bonds between the central unit and end groups, the dihedral angles are moderately increased to 25–30° for S1 and ca. 35° for T1, irrespective of the different functionals of B3LYP and M06-2X. Interestingly, the molecular twists for the T1/S0 MECP are similar to or somewhat larger than those for the T1 state. As expected, for the locked LThBF and LTThBF, the molecular backbones of the S0, S1, and T1 minima and the T1/S0 MECP are all planar; the geometry changes occur mainly in the bond lengths and at the same magnitudes as the unlocked counterparts.

Excited-state energies
The adiabatic excitation energies for S1, T1, and T2 are shown in Fig. 5. Despite the higher excitation energies for M06-2X than B3LYP due to the larger percent of Hartree–Fock exchange, the two functionals give similar overall trends for the different molecules and configurations. For all the compounds, the adiabatic excitation energies of both S1 and T2 are twice higher than the adiabatic T1 energies, thus singlet fission is favourable. The crossing and parallel configurations of the unlocked molecules show similar adiabatic excitation energies. Moreover, when the backbone torsion angle is changed, the T1 energy remains lower than one half of the S1 energy for the ThBF and TThBF compounds (see Fig. S2, ESI†), which is different from that of the 9,9′-bifluorenylidene compound.27 Importantly, upon locking with methylene, the adiabatic excitation energies for LThBF and LTThBF are obviously increased due to much less geometric relaxation. Especially, the T1 excitation energy is increased by 0.11–0.26 eV, which would be beneficial for exciton dissociation.

As mentioned above, the vertical excitation energies of T1 are similar for the locked and unlocked counterparts. However, because of an appreciable geometry difference between T1 and S0 for the unlocked molecules, the reorganization energies for both the S0 → T1 and T1 → S0 transition are much larger than the locked ones (Fig. 6a and Table S4, ESI†). As a result, the vertical emission energies of T1 for the unlocked compounds are substantially lower than those of the locked counterparts. According to the energy gap law, a lower energy gap can result in a larger transition probability for the intersystem crossing process.30 From this point, the locked molecules are better than the unlocked ones. The normal mode analyses show that the reorganization energies for the locked and unlocked molecules are similar for the high-frequency modes, but in the case of the low-frequency modes, the reorganization energies are very large for the unlocked molecules but negligible for the locked molecules (Fig. 6c and d). This is because the low-frequency vibration modes are related to molecular twist and the high-frequency modes are related to bond stretch. The result is consistent with the geometry changes and further confirmed by the projection of reorganization energies into the internal coordination (Fig. 6b). For all the molecules, the bond angle contributions to the reorganization energies are very small. The bond length contributions are the largest and similar for the locked and unlocked counterparts. Notably, the dihedral angle contributions are vanishingly small for the locked molecules, but very significant for the unlocked ones.

Triplet decay dynamics
In singlet-fission-based organic solar cells, the decay of T1 to S0 should be slow enough to guarantee that T1 excitons can diffuse to and dissociate into charge carriers at the donor/acceptor interface. Here, three T1 decay pathways, radiative phosphorescence, nonradiative ISC in the Franck–Condon region, and ISC via the T1/S0 crossing point, have been investigated. The results are listed in Table 1. As expected, the phosphorescence rates are extremely low because of the vanishingly small oscillator strengths. The ISC rates in the Franck–Condon region are calculated to be 3.51 × 109, 3.93 × 109, and 2.22 × 109 s−1 for ThBF-c, ThBF-p and TThBF-c, respectively. However, the ISC rate of LThBF is decreased to 4.44 × 103 s−1 due to the much weaker SOC and smaller reorganization energy. At the T1-geometry, the SOC is only 0.02 cm−1 for LThBF, but it is much stronger for ThBF-c, ThBF-p and TThBF-c, reaching 4.79, 5.70, and 3.50 cm−1, respectively. In the case of TThBF-p and LTThBF, the SOC between T1 (Au symmetry for TThBF-p and Bu symmetry for LTThBF) and S0 (Ag symmetry) completely vanishes due to symmetry-forbiddance, and the ISC decay process is not allowed. However, considering the Herzberg–Teller effect,47 the SOC can arise easily and the ISC will occur when the symmetry is broken by nuclear vibration. Therefore, the T1 excitons can also decay through the Franck–Condon region for TThBF-p due to its good flexibility of the T1 state (see Fig. S2, ESI†).

Similar to the T1 minima, the T1/S0 MECPs display highly twisted backbones for the unlocked molecules. As analyzed above, upon the S0 → T1 transition, the double bonds between the central thiophene/bithiophene and the end fluorene groups are weakened and thus the backbones of the T1 state are very flexible (see Fig. S2, ESI†), making the T1/S0 MECPs only 16–68 meV above the T1 minima. Moreover, except the symmetry-forbiddance for TThBF-p, the SOC is quite strong at all the MECPs. The symmetry-forbiddance for TThBF-p can be easily broken if the geometries deviate from the Ci symmetry. Therefore, the T1 state can decay rapidly through the T1/S0 crossing region for all the unlocked molecules. In contrast, for the locked compounds, the T1/S0 MECPs keep planar backbones and vanishingly small SOC according to the El-Sayed rules;48 in addition, the energies are significantly higher than the T1 minima by 307–689 meV. Therefore, the T1 decay via the T1/S0 crossing point is also effectively suppressed for the locked compounds. It was reported that the ISC from S1 to the triplet states could also be restricted in phenylalkenes and many aromatic molecules by increasing the molecular planarity and rigidity.49,50
Conclusions
We have investigated the geometric and electronic structures, and the decay dynamics of T1 to S0 in a series of quinoidal singlet fission molecules, flexible ThBF and TThBF as well as locked LThBF and LTThBF. The results show that for all the compounds, the S1 and T2 excitation energies are twice higher than the T1 excitation energies, thus singlet fission should be favorable. Compared with the flexible compounds, the locked molecules show higher T1 energies, which is more beneficial to exciton dissociation. In addition, owing to vanishingly small oscillator strengths, the radiative decay of T1 is negligible for all the compounds. The nonradiative decay of T1 is very fast for the unlocked compounds. Firstly, except symmetry-forbiddance in the parallel configuration of TThBF, the decay rates through the T1 → S0 intersystem crossing can be as high as 109 s−1 in the Franck–Condon region due to strong spin–orbit couplings (>3 cm−1) and big reorganization energies. Secondly, because of small energy barriers (<70 meV) and strong spin–orbit couplings, the T1 excitons can also decay rapidly via the T1/S0 crossing point. In contrast, thanks to the rigid and planar backbones, LThBF and LTThBF exhibit weak spin–orbit couplings (≤0.02 meV) and a small reorganization energy as well as much higher energy barriers (>300 meV); so, both the T1 nonradiative decay pathways are effectively suppressed.
