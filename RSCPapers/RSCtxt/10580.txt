    , Accepted 23rd February 2015First published on 24th February 2015AbstractA zinc di-corrole dye (Zn-cor dye), which was constructed by substitution of the Ga of a Ga di-corrole dye (Ga-cor dye) with zinc, has been characterized as having a strong light harvesting ability by density functional theory calculations. The charge is separated significantly in its excited states. It is worth noting that inserting different central metals can adjust the optical and charge-transfer properties of these kind of dyes, which are quite promising for the fabrication of high performance dye-sensitized solar cells. Based on the first-principles calculations, possible mechanisms for direct electron injection from the adsorbed dye to TiO2 have been discussed with analyses of the the band structure and DOS of the Zn-cor dye–TiO2 system.
1 Introduction
Reported by O'Regan and Grätzel in their groundbreaking work of 1991,1 dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs), which are economical and environmentally friendly photoelectric devices compared to silicon-based photoelectric conversion devices, have attracted increasing interest. In the past few decades, theoretical and experimental scientists have made great efforts to improve the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of DSCs,2–31 from exploring new and efficient dyes2–16,27–31 and modifying the semiconductor structure17–20 to optimizing the electrolyte composition,21–23 as well as exploiting different photoactive working electrodes and counter electrodes.24 Among these factors, the dyes with a wide absorption band and high absorption efficiency play a crucial role that is responsible for the performance improvement of DSCs. Over the past decades, scientists have explored a variety of dyes for DSCs, involving metal complexes, porphyrins and phthalocyanines as well as metal-free organic dyes.32 Among these dyes, the performance of a ruthenium sensitizer with efficient light-harvesting, incorporating an electron-rich hexylthio-terminal chain and in conjunction with an iodide/triiodide redox couple, was excellent, and its PCE was higher than 11%.33–35
On the other hand, the research on porphyrin dyes, which play an important role in natural photosynthesis, has made rapid progress in solar cell applications in recent years, and a new PCE record of 12.3% has been reached for porphyrin-based solar cells in combination with a cobalt-based redox electrolyte.3 The corrole,25,36 the structure of which is very similar to porphyrin, except that its two pyrrole rings are connected directly, demonstrates novel photophysical properties compared with porphyrins, such as lower oxidation potential, larger Stokes shift, and relatively more-intense absorption in the red light region.37 However, few researches have focused on corrole-based dyes in DSCs. Walker et al. have reported their research that the corrole-sensitized TiO2 solar cells were found to have relatively low PCEs.38
Recently, we designed a novel type of corrole-based dye with the unique Ga di-corrole structure (Ga-cor),39 which exhibits strong light harvesting ability and excellent charge separation properties. Its optical and electronic properties can be well modulated by the incorporation of different metals. Moreover, adsorbed TiO2 systems demonstrate excellent efficiency of charge transfer from the dye to the semiconductor. In order to improve further the PCE of corrole-based DSCs, enrich the knowledge about corrole dyes and expand their application, herein, a new zinc di-corrole dye (Zn-cor) have been designed by substitution Ga of Ga-cor with Zn. Its optical and electronic properties were studied by extensive DFT calculations. The effect of structure on the properties of the dye was discussed. Furthermore, its interactions with TiO2 were explored and plausible electron injection mechanisms have been suggested.
2 Computational details
The optical and electronic properties of the isolated dye molecules were studied by using Gaussian 09 package. The B3LYP40,41 hybrid functional in combination with the all-electron 6-31G(d) basis set42 was used in DFT calculations. The structures of the dyes were fully optimized without any symmetry constraints. Frequencies were computed to access the nature of stationary points on the potential-surfaces. The continuum solvation model of SMD43 was used to evaluate the solvent effects. Acetonitrile was considered to be a solvent by analogy to the general experimental medium. Time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) with a CAM-B3LYP44,45 exchange–correlation functional was used to compute vertical excitation energies based on the optimized structures by B3LYP.
The TiO2 nanoparticle in DSCs was model by the two-dimensional slab model of a TiO2 nanostructure obtained by cutting appropriately the most stable anatase TiO2(101) surface.
Calculations of the structural and electronic properties of the periodic systems with and without the adsorbed sensitizer were performed by using the plane-wave technique implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP).46,47
The exchange–correction potential was described by generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with the PBE functional48 in all calculations. The projector augmented wave (PAW) method49 was employed to describe the electron–ion interaction and the cutoff energy was set to 380 eV. The conjugated gradient method was used to optimize all atomic positions with a converging tolerance of 0.02 eV Å−1 for the force on all atoms. The 2D periodic boundary conditions are employed along the growth direction of the TiO2 slab nanostructure. A vacuum distance of >8 Å was set to keep the negligible interaction between layer nanostructures in the adjacent cells. Monkhorst–Pack meshes with the Gamma point were used for geometry optimization. The 2 × 2 × 1 and 11 × 11 × 1 Γ-centered k-point meshes were used in the density of states (DOS) integral for the periodic systems with and without the adsorbed dye, respectively. The Brillouin zone was sampled by 44 k-points and 20 k-points by using the line-mode to calculate their electronic band structures.
3 Results and discussion
3.1 Electronic and optical properties of free Zn-cor dyes
Similar to our previous unique Ga di-corrole dyes,39 here Zn-cor dye was constructed by using the phenylamino moiety as the electron donor, of which hydrogen atoms were substituted by Zn-corrole rings, with cyanoacrylic acid as the electron acceptor, as shown in Scheme 1. Their frontier molecular orbitals are displayed in Fig. 1 and the predicted UV-vis spectra in the gas phase and in acetonitrile are shown in Fig. 2. As Fig. 1 displays, their highest-occupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs) are mainly distributed over the dye donors and the lowest-unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMOs) are basically spread over the bridge-anchor moiety of the dyes, indicating the significant charge separation between their HOMO and LUMO.

There are two quasi-porphyrin characteristic absorption bands in the visible region in the predicted UV-vis spectra of the Zn-cor dye, corresponding to the Soret and Q bands, respectively, as shown in Fig. 2 and Table 1. Furthermore, the Zn-cor dye exhibits stronger absorption in acetonitrile solution with respect to the gas phase as found in the Ga-cor dye.39 In comparison with Ga-cor dyes,39 the absorptions in the visible region of Zn-cor dye are red shifted (shown in Fig. 2). As seen from Table 1, the largest oscillator strengths (f) are 0.7789 and 0.6786 for Zn-cor in the gas phase and in acetonitrile, respectively, both of which correspond to an excited electron moving from the HOMO to the LUMO, showing that these spectroscopic features are very favorable for the dyes to harvest solar energy in practical applications of DSCs.

In addition, short-circuit current density (JSC) is another crucial factor to improve the PCE of DSCs, which is mainly determined by the light harvesting efficiency (LHE) and the electron injection efficiency (Φinject) and closely related to the driving force (ΔGinject) of electron injection, where LHE can be computed by the relationship: LHE = 1–10−f,50 where f is the absorbance of the dye at maximum wavelength, and ΔGinject can be computed by Katoh's equation,51 respectively. Table 1 lists the predicted orbital energies, transition energies, and factors accounting for the performance improvement of DSCs.
As Table 1 shows, in comparison with the Ga-cor dye,39 the Zn-cor dye has a relatively small ΔGinject. However, with the introduction of a zinc metal center, the LHE of the Zn-cor dye increases significantly, indicating that the introduction of a zinc metal center enhances light absorption.
3.2 Electronic properties of the Zn-cor dye–TiO2 system

Adsorption of Zn-cor dye on the TiO2 surface. 
In order to evaluate the performance of the Zn-cor dye adsorbed on the TiO2 substrate for DSCs, the interaction between the novel sensitizer and the TiO2 nano-particle is investigated further. Here the most probable adsorption mode has been researched, following previous investigations52,53 this is a bridged-bidentate coordination with a deprotonated form of the cyanoacrylic acid anchoring group. The optimized structure of the Zn-cor-adsorbed TiO2 system is shown in Fig. 3a, where the dye molecule is bound to the TiO2 surface by a bidentate chelating model, in which its two oxygen atoms connect with two titanium atoms on the TiO2(101) surface, and the proton is transferred to the oxygen atom on the surface of TiO2 near the adsorbed position. The internal geometrical parameters of the Zn-cor dye vary slightly, except for the anchoring group before and after adsorption on the surface of TiO2, demonstrating the overall rigidity of the backbone of the Zn-cor dye. The average distances of Ti–O (2.18 Å) between the carboxylic oxygen atoms of the Zn-cor dye and the Ti atoms on the (101) surface of TiO2 in the chelate configuration are very similar to that (2.19 Å) of the Ga-cor dye,39 and the bonds are comparable to the Ti–O distance (1.973 Å) in the bulk TiO2, revealing the strong interaction between the Zn-cor dye and the TiO2 surface.
 Fig. 3  (a) Optimized structure of Zn-cor–TiO2 system with the dye Zn-cor adsorbed on the surface of TiO2 semiconductor nano-material; (b) the total density of states (DOS) of bare TiO2 (on the top) and the total DOS and partial density of states (PDOS) of Zn-cor–TiO2 system (at the bottom). 


Energy band structure and density of states. 
The density of states (DOS) of the bare TiO2, the total DOS and the Zn-cor partial DOS (PDOS) of the Zn-cor–TiO2 system are computed and provided in Fig. 3b on the basis of the optimized structure to further investigate the electronic coupling strength between the Zn-cor dye and TiO2 semiconductor. As Fig. 4 shows, some new π-occupied levels on the top of the TiO2 valence band are introduced owing to the Zn-cor adsorption compared with the DOS of bare TiO2, which correspond to linear band structures, illustrating that the molecular orbitals of the Zn-cor dye account entirely for these new levels. It is worth noting that there are the broad surface valence bands and conduction bands with a relatively large band gap (2.64 eV by PBE and 3.86 eV by HSE06) in the bare TiO2 model and the PDOS of the Zn-cor dye strongly overlap with the valence bands and the higher energy conduction bands of the TiO2 semiconductor over a wide range of energies. Thus the top of the valence band of the Zn-cor–TiO2 system arises from the new π-occupied levels of the Zn-cor dye. As the pure functional GGA-PBE generally underestimates the band gap remarkably, following previous study,39 the band gap is corrected by the hybrid functional HSE06 calculation, which can predict a relatively accurate band gap.54,55 An increment of 1.22 eV is incorporated into the underestimated gaps.39 Accordingly, the corrected band gap of the dye–TiO2 system is 1.36 eV.
 Fig. 4  The band structures and the density of states of the Zn-cor–TiO2 system (on the right), the selected occupied molecular orbitals of Zn-cor in the ground state (at the bottom) and the partial charge densities (isovalue 0.0004 a.u.) for the Gamma point of the 1189–1194 bands corresponding to the identified band structures, respectively. 


Electronic injection mechanism. 
Further comparison of the partial charge densities at the Gamma (G) point of bands of the Zn-cor–TiO2 system and the molecular orbitals of the free Zn-cor dye, as shown in Fig. 4, shows that the partial charge density of the highest valence band 1193 at G point of the Zn-cor–TiO2 system is very similar to the HOMO orbital, suggesting that the band mainly comes from the contribution of the HOMO of pure Zn-cor dye. On the contrary, the lowest unoccupied band 1194 of the Zn-cor–TiO2 system basically originates from Ti(3d) of the substrate TiO2 conduction band. Therefore, it is possible that the photoexcited electrons can transfer from the HOMO in the ground-state Zn-cor dye into the conduction band if this direct electronic excitation is accessible.

4 Conclusions
Based on a previous study, a Zn-cor dye has been designed with zinc substitution with Ga to produce a Ga-cor dye, which exhibits strong light harvesting ability in broad visible region. There is excellent charge separation between its donor and acceptor moieties in the excited state. Moreover, calculations show that the electronic and photoelectronic properties of these metal di-corrole dyes can be well modulated by incorporating different center metals. On the basis of analyses of band structures and DOS of the Zn-cor dye–TiO2 system, possible mechanisms for direct electron injections were proposed. The present theoretical studies further enrich knowledge for the design of metal di-corrole-based dyes for DSCs.
