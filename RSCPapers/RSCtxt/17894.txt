    , Accepted 4th May 2011First published on 17th June 2011AbstractFlexible inverted organic solar cells (IOSCs) with a zinc oxide (ZnO) thin film layer acting as an effective electron transport layer and a low reflective light absorber were fabricated in this study. The high quality ZnO thin films on flexible indium tin oxide-coated polyethersulfone (PES) substrates were grown in a non-vacuum process using mist pyrolysis chemical vapor deposition at a low temperature of 180 °C without any thermal damage to the PES substrate. The power conversion efficiency of the flexible IOSCs with ZnO thin films averaged 3.1% at a simulated air-mass of 1.5 global full-sun (100 mW cm−2) illumination, which was greater than that of flexible IOSCs with a ZnO thin film formed using a sol–gel method (approximately 2.3%).
Introduction
In recent years, organic photovoltaics (OPVs) have attracted substantial attention due to their low cost, light weight, and semi-transparency compared with conventional silicon-based, large area solar energy production. Replacing the glass substrate with a plastic substrate makes OPVs useful in wearable, portable, and bendable polymer solar cells.1 Flexible polymer solar cells based on plastic substrates such as polyethylene naphthalate (PEN), polyethersulfone (PES), and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) can be easily integrated in a curved form that is suitable for portable and wearable applications.2–5 An inverted organic solar cell (IOSC) as an OPV has been actively studied due to its high potential interface stability, which results from a replacement of the low work function metal cathode (e.g., Al and PEDOT:PSS) with high work function materials and the introduction of inorganic material as a desirable electron transport path that can effectively transport electrons from the polymer layer to the electrodes.6
Recently, IOSCs fabricated with zinc oxide (ZnO) acting as an optical spacer,7 a hole blocking layer,8 and as a direct and ordered path by which photo-generated electrons can be collected at the cathode9,10 have been regarded as promising structures that will increase the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and reliability of OPVs. The introduction of a ZnO optical spacer between the cathode and the active layer allows for an increase in light absorption into the active layer resulting from a redistribution of the light intensity. Although ZnO thin films for flexible device applications have been typically prepared on plastic substrates using a sol–gel method,11 aqueous solution approach,12 roll-to-roll sputtering system,13 or atomic layer deposition,14 these processes have many problems such as low adhesion, plasma damage to substrates, low crystallinity, high resistivity, increasing reflectance by a flat surface, and process difficulty.
Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) usually leads to the formation of ZnO thin films with high crystallinity, good adhesion to the substrate, and high photon absorption due to a hazed surface morphology, which is beneficial for photovoltaic device applications. Metalorganic CVD has been regarded as a promising method to synthesize high quality ZnO thin films at temperatures below 500 °C.15 However, this method is inappropriate for the growth of ZnO thin films on plastic substrates due to its relatively high growth temperature compared to the glass transition temperatures of PEN (120 °C) and PES (200 °C). Therefore, the deposition of high quality ZnO thin films onto plastic substrates using a CVD system without any thermal damage to the plastic substrates is one of the most important issues in flexible IOSC applications.
In this work, we report the successful growth of high quality ZnO thin films on indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated PES substrates. A novel mist pyrolysis CVD (MPCVD) method based on a non-vacuum process at a low growth temperature of 180 °C was used without any thermal damage to the substrates. The effect of the MPCVD-grown ZnO thin film thickness on IOSC efficiency was investigated. The IOSCs with the MPCVD-grown ZnO thin films revealed an average PCE of 3.1% at a simulated air mass (AM) of 1.5 global full-sun (1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2) illumination, which is greater than the average PCE (2.3%) of the flexible IOSCs with the ZnO thin film deposited using a sol–gel method.
Experimental
High quality ZnO thin films were grown on flexible plastic substrates using the MPCVD method. ZnO thin films were also deposited by a sol–gel method, and these were used as reference samples. ITO (100 nm)-coated PES flexible substrates were cleaned by sequential ultrasonication in acetone and methanol. The source solution for the MPCVD growth of ZnO was composed of 0.01 M zinc acetate [Zn(CH3COO)2]-dissolved acetone. The source solution was ultrasonically atomized to form a ZnO precursor in a solution container. Nitrogen, at a flow of 5000 standard cubic centimetres per minute (sccm), was introduced as a carrier gas to transport the atomized solution to the substrates in the chamber reactor. Fig. 1a shows a schematic of the MPCVD system used in this work. ZnO thin films with thicknesses from 20 nm to 100 nm were deposited onto PES substrates at 180 °C. In order to deposit ZnO thin films using the sol–gel method, zinc acetate (0.5 M) as a solute, 2-methoxy ethanol (C3H8O2) as a solvent, and monoethanolamine (C2H7NO) as a stabilizing agent were combined and stirred at 60 °C for 60 min to form the ZnO sol. ZnO thin films were deposited onto ITO/PES substrates using spin coating at 4000 rpm for 20 s and heated at 160 °C for 30 min.

In order to fabricate IOSCs with ZnO thin films, poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) as a donor material and [6,6]-phenyl C61butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) as an acceptor material were dissolved into chlorobenzene (CB) at a weight ratio of 1:1 for 14 hours. This conjugated polymer (180 nm thickness) was deposited by spin coating at 900 rpm onto ZnO thin films that were deposited by either MPCVD or sol–gel methods, and subsequently annealed at 120 °C for 10 min. MoO3 (20 nm) as an electron blocking layer and Ag (80 nm) as a top electrode were deposited by a thermal evaporator. Surface morphologies of the ZnO thin films prepared using both the MPCVD and sol–gel methods were examined by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The optical transmittance spectra were recorded by an ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometer (UV-VIS), and the crystallinities of the prepared samples were investigated using X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements. In addition, the conductivity of the samples was estimated using Hall effect measurements based on the Van der Pauw configuration. Characterizations of the fabricated IOSCs were carried out by measuring current density–voltage (J–V) using a solar simulator under an irradiation intensity of 100 mW cm−2.
Results and discussion
The FE-SEM images in Fig. 1b and c show the observed surface morphologies of the ZnO thin films deposited by MPCVD and sol–gel methods, respectively. The surface of the sol–gel-deposited ZnO thin film was wrinkled and porous, while the MPCVD-grown ZnO thin films with uniform morphology had a hazed surface capable of enhancing light absorption. The root-mean-square (RMS) roughness values of the sol–gel-deposited ZnO thin film and the MPCVD-grown ZnO thin film were 1.49 nm and 6.91 nm, respectively. The grain size and the roughness of the MPCVD-grown ZnO thin film were smaller and larger, respectively, than those of the sol–gel-deposited ZnO thin film.
Based on previous studies, we used zinc acetate as the precursor for the growth of ZnO thin films using MPCVD.16 Acetone, which has a lower boiling point than deionized (DI) water, was applied as a solvent to deposit ZnO thin films at lower temperatures. Based on previous studies,16,17 we suggest that the absorption of Zn ions from vaporized Zn acetate was generated on the substrate as follows, 4Zn(CH3COO)2(g) → 4Zn2+ + 8CH3COO−(1)where “g” represents the gas state; the ZnO thin films are grown by decomposing the Zn acetate and continual processing. Acetone is very important in growth both as a solvent and as a source material for the support of the oxygen (O) ions. When the acetone is heated, H2O is released from the combustion reaction of acetone with O2 in air according to the following reaction,18,19 CH3COCH3(g) + 4O2(g) → 3CO2(g) + 3H2O(2)
The subsequent surface reactions can be described as the following equations, H2O(g) → H+ + OH(3) CH3COO− + H+ → CH3COOH(g)(4) Zn2+ + 2OH → ZnO + H2O(5)
The acetone is also expected to improve properties of the ZnO crystals due to the presence of H2O during the growth process.16
XRD patterns shown in Fig. 2 reveal the crystalline properties of approximately 50 nm thick ZnO thin films on ITO/PES substrates that were deposited by both MPCVD and sol–gel methods. Although ITO-related peaks dominated the patterns of both ZnO thin films, ZnO (100) and (110) plane peaks were observed exclusively from the MPCVD-grown ZnO thin film. Alternatively, distinct ZnO-related peaks were not detected from the sol–gel-deposited ZnO thin film. This indicates that the MPCVD-grown ZnO thin film has a higher crystallinity than the sol–gel-deposited ZnO thin film.

Fig. 3 shows schematics of the stages of ZnO thin film fabrication via the MPCVD process. As illustrated in Fig. 3a, ZnO nuclei formed in the initial deposition onto the non-epitaxial ITO/PES substrate. Nuclei often exhibit random orientations.20 In certain orientations, cluster growth emerges from the initial layers of nuclei with further deposition. The preferred orientation of clusters is determined only by the preferred orientations of the initial nuclei at this stage.21,22 It correspond to the (100) and (101) planes observed in the XRD spectra (Fig. 3b). The cluster morphology transformed into the rough surface morphology as the growth proceeded. The Volmer–Weber (V–W) growth mode23,24 is thought to be responsible for the formation of the rough surface morphology where adatom–adatom interactions were stronger than those of the adatom–substrate surface, which led to formation of the rough surface (Fig. 3c).

Fig. 4 illustrates the transmission and reflectance spectra for the ZnO thin films. The sol–gel and MPCVD-based thin film thicknesses were both approximately 50 nm. In both cases, high transmittances of approximately 83% and 86% at a wavelength of 550 nm were obtained, respectively. In addition, the MPCVD-grown ZnO thin film had a lower reflectance compared to that of the sol–gel-deposited ZnO thin film in all wavelength regions. These results suggest that the higher transmittance and lower reflectance from the MPCVD-grown ZnO thin film are due to its high crystallinity and highly rough surface morphology compared to the sol–gel-deposited ZnO thin film.25,26

Fig. 5 shows a schematic and a cross-sectional FE-SEM image of the flexible IOSCs fabricated with ZnO thin films that simultaneously act as electron transport (hole blocking) layers and low reflective light absorbers. The structure of the flexible IOSCs in the present work was composed of Ag (top electrode)/MoO3 (electron blocking layer)/PCBM:P3HT (active layer)/ZnO (electron transport layer)/ITO (bottom electrode). The ZnO thin film fabricated via the MPCVD method was deposited uniformly, as shown in Fig. 5b.

J–V measurements were performed using a solar simulator under standard AM 1.5 G solar illumination in order to compare the solar power performances of the IOSCs that were fabricated using varied thicknesses of the sol–gel-deposited ZnO thin films and the MPCVD-grown ZnO thin films. Fig. 6 shows the J–V curves of IOSCs fabricated with ZnO thin films prepared using sol–gel and MPCVD methods under AM 1.5 G irradiation. The short-circuit current (JSC), fill factor (FF), open-circuit current (VOC), and PCE of the IOSC with the MPCVD-grown ZnO thin film were 9.91 mA cm−2, 58.86%, 0.53 V, and 3.11%, respectively. The IOSC with the sol–gel-deposited ZnO thin film exhibited 8.60 mA cm−2, 50.62%, 0.54 V, and 2.33% for JSC, FF, VOC, and PCE, respectively.

The JSC and FF of the IOSC fabricated with MPCVD-grown ZnO thin film were greater than the IOSC with the sol–gel ZnO thin film. As shown in Fig. 1b and c, the RMS value of the MPCVD ZnO thin film was greater than that of the sol–gel-deposited ZnO thin film. This result indicates that the interfacial area between the active layer and the MPCVD-grown ZnO thin film was greater than that between the active layer and the sol–gel ZnO thin film. The enlarged interfacial area can lead to an effective increase in the number of electrons transferred from the active layer to the ZnO electron transport layer. Furthermore, a higher transmittance increases the amount of light reaching the active layer, which leads to the enhanced photocurrent generation.27–29 The enhancement in the PCE of IOSCs fabricated with the MPCVD-grown ZnO thin films exhibited improved conductivity (σ) of the MPCVD-grown ZnO thin film (9.8 × 10−5 (Ω cm)−1) compared to that of the sol–gel-deposited ZnO thin film (1.4 × 10−6 (Ω cm)−1); this led to an enhanced JSC value for the MPCVD-grown ZnO thin film. The conductivity of the ZnO thin film in IOSCs affects the series resistance (RS), and the lower RS of the MPCVD-grown ZnO thin film leads to enhanced JSC and FF.28,30 The JSC and FF of an IOSC can be expressed as31 JSC = (Vdark − VOC)/RS(6) (7)where Vdark is the intersection between the x axis and the J–V curve shifted by the JSC, and RP is the parallel resistance. In the case of sol–gel-deposited ZnO thin films, the surface morphology is very porous, which serves as a leakage current path and consequently results in the decrease of RP and PCE.32 The J–V curve of the IOSC in the dark is shown in Fig. 6b. The much greater forward current density observed in the dark J–V curve induced by the introduction of the MPCVD-grown ZnO thin film was additional evidence indicating that the lower RS enhanced the PCE.

Fig. 7 shows the J–V curves of IOSCs with various thicknesses of MPCVD-grown ZnO thin films under standard AM 1.5 G solar illumination and in the dark. Typical J–V curves for IOSCs are shown in Fig. 7a. For IOSCs with 20 to 50 nm-thick ZnO thin films, values of JSC, FF, and PCE gradually increased with a constant VOC of 0.53 V (±0.01) as the film thickness increased. All performance values for the IOSCs reached a maximum with the 50 nm thick ZnO thin film, but gradually started decreasing for thicknesses greater than 50 nm. The introduction of ZnO leads to a blockage of the hole transport to the ITO electrode and a reduction in the bulk electric field. Furthermore, as ZnO thin film thickness increased from 20 nm to 50 nm, the collection of electrons at the ITO cathode was further enhanced by the continued reduction of the bulk electric field, resulting in electron accumulation, which enhances the electron transport to the ITO (i.e., JSC is enhanced).14 Although the leakage current decreased with increasing thickness due to increased RP, the FF was enhanced.32 Alternatively, at a thickness greater than 80 nm, the increased RS was attributed to the increase in the ZnO thin film resistance, resulting in a slightly decreasing FF and JSC (the effect of RS was more dominant than RP on JSC and FF).

Table 1 summarizes the performance of the IOSCs that were fabricated by varying the thickness of the MPCVD-grown ZnO thin films. According to the dark J–V curve, we confirmed that current densities increased remarkably, and then decreased slightly with an increase in the thickness of the ZnO thin films, which is consistent with the trend of current density in the J–V curve under illumination.

Conclusion
Flexible IOSCs based on a ZnO thin film acting as a simultaneous effective electron transport layer and low reflective light absorber were produced. The high quality ZnO were successfully grown on flexible ITO-coated PES substrates using the non-vacuum MPCVD method at a low temperature of 180 °C without any thermal damage to the PES substrate. The MPCVD-grown ZnO thin films revealed a more uniform surface morphology (non-porous), higher crystalline quality, higher transparency, and higher conductivity compared with that of the sol–gel-deposited ZnO thin films. The PCE of the flexible IOSCs with ZnO thin films was approximately 3.1% at simulated AM 1.5 G illuminations, which was greater than the PCE of flexible IOSCs with a thin film formed using the sol–gel method (approximately 2.3%). The enhancement of the PCE in the IOSC with the MPCVD-grown ZnO thin film was due to the greater light absorption and enlarged electron-transport path of the MPCVD-grown ZnO thin film.
