    , Accepted 22nd September 2016First published on 23rd September 2016AbstractSynthesis of hybrid materials is an important topic of research for the design of new materials and development of industrial applications. Among the numerous pathways reported in the literature, a concomitant light induced sol–gel process and organic photopolymerization has recently appeared to be a promising alternative. In light of the potential benefits of copper catalyzed azide–alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC), we investigate in this work a novel one-step methodology for preparing hybrid materials by combining photoinduced sol–gel polymerization and the light-induced CuAAC reaction. Isopropylthioxanthone was used as a photosensitizer to prompt both generation of acid by reduction of iodonium salt and formation of Cu(I) by reduction of Cu(II). Polymerization kinetics of the separated reactions were first investigated by real-time FTIR providing a clear picture of the mechanism. Then, both reactions were simultaneously monitored and both reactions were shown to occur concomitantly.
Introduction
Hybrid materials are attracting increasing interest for the development of innovative industrial applications in areas like protective and decorative coatings, energy applications (hybrid flexible batteries or solar cells), and in human care (ophthalmics, cosmetics, therapeutic vectors and drug delivery). They generally attempt to combine hardness, flexibility and resistance to chemicals, scratching, and heat, while maintaining transparency and gloss.1,2 The broad field of organic–inorganic materials is largely dominated by silicon chemistry combined with the sol–gel process. This success is due notably to the good stability of the Si–C bond during the formation of the silica network allowing the production of an organic modified inorganic network in one step.
Recently, photoinduced sol–gel polymerization has stood out as an efficient one-step process to synthesize a wide range of inorganic and hybrid materials,3,4 which can be distinguished from conventional sol–gel methods by higher reactivity and a solvent free process. The approach relies on low molecular weight organoalkoxysilanes R′Si(OR)3 which have been directly hydrolyzed and condensed through use of photoacid generators (PAGs) or photobase generators (PBGs). Upon irradiation, these molecules can release acids or bases able to catalyze the sol–gel reaction in the presence of atmospheric water diffusing within the layer (Scheme 1). This opened the way to smart synthesis of hybrid materials by using organoalkoxysilanes bearing a photopolymerizable organic function (R′). It also made it possible to simultaneously create a solid crosslinked organic–inorganic network. Most of the pathways exploited were radical,5 acid6,7 or base8–10 catalyzed polymerization.

In parallel to the studies performed in the photo-sol–gel area or conventional photopolymerization, a new type of light-induced reaction was developed in the last years, Copper Catalyzed Azide–Alkyne Cycloaddition (CuAAC), which is classified as click chemistry. As introduced in 2001 by Sharpless, click chemistry is defined as a “set of powerful, highly reliable, and selective reactions for the rapid synthesis of useful new compounds”.11 Click chemistry is not limited to a single type of reaction, but it is considered a synthetic strategy. The first catalytic system reported to give high yield12 was based on a combination of copper(II) sulfate and sodium ascorbate. However, it exhibited a slow reaction rate and required the catalyst to be used in a large amount. Furthermore, copper removal after the reaction remained an issue. Other metals such as ruthenium, silver, gold, iridium, nickel or zinc have been investigated and their efficiency in catalyzing azide–alkyne cycloaddition was thoroughly detailed in a recent review.13 Nevertheless, copper remains the most used catalyst because it is affordable and easy to process. In this context, there have been many initiatives to accelerate the reaction rate of CuAAC including increased heat,14 use of ultrasound,15 or addition of podand-like ionic liquids.16 Optimization of the ligand structure has been also reported to improve reactivity. Indeed, nitrogen ligands are known to accelerate reaction rates: among them, the most used are amines, pyridines, triazoles and N-heterocyclic carbenes.17–19 Finally, a promising alternative to these methods was recently proposed in 2010 by Yagci et al. and is based on a light-induced process.20 Light-induced click reactions combine the classical benefits of click reactions with the advantages of a photochemical process. Contrary to other polymerization techniques used for hybrid materials, CuAAC polymerization is a step growth reaction, allowing a higher polymerization conversion, as gelation occurs much later in the reaction, and forming a more homogenous network.21 One of the advantages of CuAAC photopolymerization is that it forms a triazole cycle which has excellent thermal and chemical stability and can increase transition temperatures due to the rigidity of the heterocycle. Furthermore, triazoles are able to participate in secondary interactions such as π–π stacking and hydrogen bonding which improve the toughness of the final materials.22
In light of the potential benefits of CuAAC, we investigate in this work a novel one-step methodology for preparing hybrid materials by combining photoinduced sol–gel polymerization and the light-induced CuAAC reaction. To understand all key factors controlling the concomitant organic and inorganic reactions, a model system was studied, starting from a formulation comprising a polydimethylsiloxane oligomer, ethyl 2-azidopropionate, and propargyl alcohol. In order to highlight the contribution of each pathway to the overall light-induced process, organic and inorganic reactions were first studied separately. Then, particular attention was paid to investigating the interdependence between the different photoinitiating systems and selecting the right experimental conditions that could afford a simultaneous organic–inorganic polymerization. Real-time FTIR was used to follow the reaction kinetics and NMR spectroscopy (29Si in solid state and 1H in liquid state) to prove the formation of a 3D inorganic network and the triazole cycle of the light-induced CuAAC reaction.
Experimental
Materials
Ethyl 2-bromopropionate (Alfa Aesar), propargyl alcohol (Sigma Aldrich), copper(II) chloride (Sigma Aldrich), N,N,N′,N′′,N′′-pentamethyldiethylenetriamine (PMDETA, Sigma Aldrich), and poly(dimethoxysiloxane) (PDMOS, ABCR) were used as received. PDMOS (with an average of five silicon atoms per oligomer) is a non-hydrolyzed, nonvolatile liquid oligomeric silicate precursor derived from tetramethyl orthosilicate (TMOS). A combination of isopropylthioxanthone (ITX, Fluka, a mixture of 2- and 4-isomers) and (4-methylphenyl)[4-(2-methylpropyl)phenyl]-iodonium hexafluorophosphate (Irgacure 250, supplied by BASF as 75% solution in propylene carbonate) was used as the photoinitiating system. Ethyl 2-azidopropionate was synthesized according to the literature.23
Methods

Sample preparation. 
For all samples, the CuCl2[PMDETA] complex was prepared by dissolving a 1:1 molar ratio of CuCl2 and PMDETA in methanol. The solution was stirred overnight at room temperature to obtain a blue solution. Formulations for concomitant photo-click and photosol–gel reactions were prepared by mixing ethyl 2-azidopropionate and PDMOS (1:1 wt%) with 17.5 wt% of propargyl alcohol (1:1.1 azide:alkyne mol%), 3.5 wt% of CuCl2[PMDETA] complex in MeOH, 3 wt% of I250, 2 wt% of ITX, 55.5 wt% of MeOH and 18.5 wt% of H2O (relative to amount of weight of PDMOS and ethyl 2-azidopropionate). They were stirred for a few hours in the absence of light to obtain a homogeneous formulation.


Real time Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (RT-FTIR). 
The kinetics of the photoclick or photosol–gel reactions were followed by RT-FTIR measurements: the formulation was laminated between two BaF2 pellets and exposed simultaneously to UV irradiation and an IR analytical beam (Bruker Vertex 70, 4 cm−1 resolution). Irradiation was performed using the polychromatic light of a mercury–xenon lamp (Hamamatsu, L8521, 200 W fitted with a 365 nm reflector) coupled with a flexible light guide, with an incident irradiance of 240 mW cm−2. At the output of the flexible light guide, a 3 mm thick borosilicate glass plate was placed to cut all wavelengths below 300 nm. Upon irradiation, the hydrolysis of the methoxysilyl (Si–OCH3) group of PDMOS was followed by a decrease of the band at 839 cm−1 (symmetrical C–O stretching mode) and the corresponding kinetics were presented as a function of time. Efficiency of the CuAAC reaction was demonstrated by the decrease of the vibration band of the azide group (2100 cm−1). It has been verified by NMR characterization that all the azide groups are fully converted into triazole cycles (see hereafter). All measurements were repeated at least three times and reproducible results were obtained.


Solid state NMR spectroscopy. 
To obtain quantitatively reliable 29Si solid state NMR spectra, single pulse magic angle spinning (SPE-MAS) experiments were performed on a Bruker Advance II 300 spectrometer operating at B0 = 9.4 T (Larmor frequency: t0(Si) = 79.49 MHz) with a Bruker double channel 7 mm probe. The spectrum was recorded using a pulse angle of π/4, a recycling delay of 80 s, a spinning frequency of 4 kHz and high-power proton decoupling during the acquisition. All the NMR experiments were performed at room temperature and chemical shifts reported thereafter are relative to tetramethylsilane. These recording conditions ensured the quantitative determination of the proportions of the different Qn siloxane species. Deconvolution of the spectrum was performed using Dmfit software.
Since solid state NMR analysis requires a higher amount of sample, a second irradiation system was used for large scale samples. Formulations laminated between two polypropylene films and covered by a 3 mm thick borosilicate glass plate were irradiated on a UV conveyor (microwave H lamp, Fusion) with a belt speed of 9.5 m min−1 and a light intensity of 600 mW cm−2 per pass (20 passes for each sample).


Liquid state NMR. 
Proton NMR analysis was performed in deuterated dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO-d) at 20 °C on a Bruker 300 MHz spectrometer.


UV-visible spectrophotometry. 
Absorbance spectra of solutions were obtained in acetonitrile using a 1 cm quartz cell and recorded on a Specord UV–Visible spectrophotometer.

Results and discussion
Key conditions for an efficient photoinduced click reaction
Organic azides are known to decompose under UV irradiation into imine products24,25 after nitrogen abstraction and rearrangement. Therefore, in order to limit degradation of azide, the initial absorption spectrum of which is reported in Fig. S1,† irradiation was performed under a mercury–xenon lamp filtered with a borosilicate glass cutting out all wavelengths below 300 nm (Fig. S2†). Under these conditions, azide photodegradation (followed at 2100 cm−1) was limited below 20% after 20 minutes of irradiation (Fig. S3†), a timescale suitable to trigger the concomitant reactions without any azide decomposition. CuAAC reactions can be photoinitiated by the in situ generation of Cu(I) from Cu(II) complexes under UV or visible light irradiation. Indeed, direct absorption of light by a copper ligand promotes intramolecular electron transfer from the π- or n-system of the ligand to the central ion resulting in the reduction of the Cu(II) ion into Cu(I) and the ligand to the radical-ion.20,26 However, because of the low absorption properties of Cu(II) complexes, this approach requires long irradiation times. Therefore, it is generally preferred to promote a bimolecular electron transfer to Cu(II) complexes either from the excited state of a polyaromatic hydrocarbon or from a photogenerated radical.22,27,28 The mechanism of photosensitization from excited photosensitizers was proposed by Yilmaz et al.29 Under light absorption, the photosensitizer (PS) is promoted into an excited state (PS*) from which an electron transfer occurs between PS* and Cu(II) to produce a radical cation and Cu(I). In this study, isopropylthioxanthone (ITX) was chosen as the photosensitizer because of its ability to photoreduce Cu(II) (Scheme 2) as well as its efficiency in the presence of a photoacid generator in releasing strong acids to catalyze photosol–gel reactions (see next section).30N,N,N′,N′′,N′′-Pentamethyldiethylenetriamine (PMDETA) was selected as the ligand to increase the solubility with respect to CuCl2.26,31 A 1:1 molar ratio of CuCl2 and PMDETA was used for the click-reaction.

The products resulting from the click reaction between propargyl alcohol and ethyl 2-azidopropionate (Scheme 2) were first characterized by liquid state 1H NMR spectroscopy (Fig. S4†). The presence of the chemical shift at 8.08 ppm evidences the formation of the triazole aromatic group. Simultaneously, the -yne and -azido peaks (respectively at 3.25 and 4.30 ppm) vanish and evidence a total conversion through the click reaction. Reaction kinetics were monitored by real time FTIR spectroscopy by following the decrease of the azide peak at 2100 cm−1. The influence of CuCl2/PMDETA concentration on the photoinduced click reaction is shown in Fig. 1.
 Fig. 1  Influence of ITX (A) and CuCl2/PMDETA (B) concentration on the efficiency of the photoinduced click reaction between propargyl alcohol and ethyl 2-azidopropionate followed by RT FTIR. (1:1.1 azide/alkyne molar ratio, (A) 3.5 wt% of CuCl2/PMDETA, (B) 2.0 wt% of ITX. Irradiation: Hg–Xe lamp filtered with a borosilicate glass, 240 mW cm−2.) 
For all samples, 25 s irradiation is sufficient to initiate the photoclick reaction. Below 0.6 wt% of CuCl2/PMDETA, copper reduction strongly dictates the initial reaction rate. As depicted in Fig. 1, the latter can also be tuned by the photosensitizer concentration relative to the copper complex. An increase in ITX amount leads to a higher concentration of excited states available to efficiently reduce the copper complex and then catalyze the click reaction. For all experiments, final conversion was 100%, which is in agreement with 1H NMR analysis. For the following experiments, a concentration of 1.5 wt% in CuCl2/PMDETA and 2 wt% in ITX has been selected.
Key conditions for an efficient photosol–gel reaction of PDMOS
Conventional photoacid generators only exhibit absorption bands confined to the short wavelength region of the UV spectrum (<300 nm). However, as explained previously, azides decompose at these wavelengths. In order to match the spectral emission of the filtered Hg–Xe, the photosol–gel reaction of PDMOS needs to be photosensitized. We use isopropylthioxanthone as the photosensitizer as for the photoinduced click reaction. Because the photoinduced click reaction was laminated between two BaF2 pellets to prevent oxidation of Cu(I) to Cu(II), it was necessary to add 1.5 mol equiv. of water to the system, corresponding to the stoichiometric proportion for PDMOS. PDMOS and water are not miscible and a co-solvent, methanol, was added to obtain a homogenous formulation (3:1 methanol:water wt%). To give insight into the photosol–gel process, evolution of the PDMOS characteristic IR bands (Table 1) was followed as a function of irradiation time and ITX concentration.

Hydrolysis proceeds by nucleophilic attack of water on the silicon center. We chose to study the symmetric C–O stretching vibration at 839 cm−1 to follow its efficiency which depends on ITX concentration as presented in Fig. 2. Hydrolysis levels off at 70% even for an ITX concentration of 4 wt%. The presence of methanol added for solubility issues can account for this result. Indeed it is a protic solvent and its ability to have a labile proton determines whether cations are solvated more strongly through hydrogen bonding. Because hydrolysis is catalyzed by cationic ions, protic solvent reduces the catalytic activity under acidic conditions.32 Nevertheless, under most conditions in conventional sol–gel chemistry, condensation is known to start before hydrolysis is complete.3,33–35 The 1000–1300 cm−1 region including the Si–O–Si stretching band massif is representative of the polycondensation reactions. However, it is difficult to monitor it due to the presence of the strong νas(C–O) at 1090 cm−1 and ρs(CH3) at 1196 cm−1, which change during hydrolysis. As a result, the Si–O–Si band can be investigated only after complete hydrolysis. However, it is possible to see a change of IR spectrum before and after irradiation (Fig. 3).

 Fig. 3  FTIR spectrum of PDMOS before and after sol–gel photopolymerization in the range of 1000–1300 cm−1. 
A shift of the vibrational band during irradiation from 1090 to 1070 cm−1 proves that condensation reactions occur. In the literature, this broad absorption band has been assigned to an overlap of two pairs of transverse optical (TO) and longitudinal optical (LO) modes.33,36 By deconvolution and using a conventional curve fitting, this band can be successfully resolved into four Gaussian peaks: ∼1070–1080 cm−1 (TO3), ∼1200 cm−1 (LO3), ∼1157–1170 cm−1 (TO4), and ∼1130 cm−1 (LO4). The most intense peak at ∼1070–1080 cm−1 (TO3) can be used as a marker to probe the photoinduced condensation reaction. These results evidence the production of a tack-free solid film after irradiation.
Cross-influences of the different precursors and initiating systems of each type of reaction
In the previous sections, a photoinitiating system was optimized to perform separated photo-click and photosol–gel reactions. To go a step further, the presence of precursors and initiating systems of both processes were investigated during photoclick or photosol–gel reactions to determine their influence. First, a photoinduced click reaction was performed in the presence of PDMOS (1:1 wt% of PDMOS:azide) or a photoacid generator (I250), used separately. As shown in Fig. 4, PDMOS has a positive impact on the photoclick kinetics since full azide consumption was achieved in a shorter time. This result may be attributed to a diluting effect of PDMOS that favours a faster click-reaction. Conversely, addition of I250 decreases the rate of photoinduced click reaction, a consequence of the competition between photosensitization of I250 and Cu(II) by ITX. However, after 100 s the amount of reduced Cu(I) is sufficient to reach full azide conversion. These results clearly attest that the photoinduced click reaction is only slightly affected by the presence of PDMOS or I250. Its efficiency remains unchanged but it is delayed in time.
 Fig. 4  Influence of the presence of PDMOS or I250 on the efficiency of the photoinduced click reaction between propargyl alcohol and ethyl 2-azidopropionate followed by RT FTIR. (3.5 wt% of CuCl2/PMDETA, 2.0 wt% of ITX and with 3.0 wt% of I250 or PDMOS/ethyl 2-azidopropionate in a ratio of (1:1) wt%, ethyl 2-azidopropionate/propargyl alcohol (1:1.1) molar ratio. Irradiation conditions: Hg–Xe lamp filtered with a borosilicate glass, 240 mW cm−2.) 
In a similar way, photoinduced sol–gel polymerization of PDMOS was achieved in the presence of the CuCl2/PMDETA complex or with the azide/alkyne mixture (Fig. 5). With CuCl2/PMDETA, the hydrolysis rate decreases dramatically, leading to a limited hydrolysis of 20% after 600 s. Two reasons can explain this behavior. As already observed in Fig. 4, there is a competition between photosensitization of I250 and Cu(II) by ITX, which could lead to a decreased concentration of Brönsted superacids. More likely still is that the presence of the amine PMDETA affects the acid catalyzed sol–gel process as reported in the literature.37 Surprisingly, the mixture of propargyl alcohol/ethyl 2-azidopropionate reduces the hydrolysis rate but allows almost complete hydrolysis. This may be attributed to the diluting effect resulting from the presence of azide/alkyne and a lowered viscosity during the photosol–gel reaction which is in favor of better species diffusion for an efficient hydrolysis.

Irradiation conditions: Hg–Xe lamp filtered with a borosilicate glass, 240 mW cm−2.) 
Concomitant photoinduced click reaction and sol–gel photopolymerization
The previous results obtained for each type of reaction (photoclick or photosol–gel) have highlighted the interdependency between the different reactions but also evidenced the possibility to activate in a one step process both organic and inorganic reactions. This section gathers the results corresponding to a concomitant photopolymerization. Concentrations of 2 wt% of ITX, 3 wt% of I250 and 3.5 wt% of CuCl2/PMDETA were considered as the optimized parameters. Fig. 6 demonstrates that light can trigger both reactions simultaneously and Table 2 shows some kinetics parameters. For sol–gel photopolymerization, the hydrolysis rate is slowed down compared with experiments with PDMOS alone but full conversion is reached in 400 s. It can be noticed that the hydrolysis curve shape is similar to the one related to photosol–gel in the presence of azide and alkyne (Fig. 5). The detrimental effect of amine is not observed since it is involved in the photoreduction of Cu(II) into Cu(I) and the cycloaddition process. Concerning the photoclick reaction, azide conversion exhibits substantially delayed kinetics compared to the results shown in Fig. 4 and a decrease in azide consumption is observed. Since the photosol–gel reaction is faster, an increase in viscosity and the presence of the 3D inorganic network seems to account for this result.

NMR spectroscopy was used to assess the condensation of the siloxane network and evidence the cycloaddition between azide and alkyne and formation of the triazole cycle. Solid-state 29Si NMR is a powerful technique to provide information on the various environments of the silicon atom. The SPE MAS (Single Pulse Excitation Angle Spinning) mode in solid-state 29Si NMR allows a quantitative characterization of the sample. By spectrum deconvolution it is possible to determine the proportion of each sub-structure and calculate the condensation degree (CD) of the silica network (eqn (1)).38 (1)where n is the number of siloxane bonds (0 ≤ n ≤ 4) and f is the functionality of the silicon atom (i.e. f = 4). Solid state NMR analysis requires a large sample amount that involves the use of a UV belt conveyor. Fig. 7 displays the quantitative spectra of UV cross-linked PDMOS films in the presence of the photoinduced click product or the azide/alkyne polymer. As reported in Table 3, siloxane species Q3 and Q4 are dominant, indicating that the photoinduced sol–gel process, in the presence of the photoinduced click reaction, leads to a well-condensed material.3 The degree of condensation was evaluated to be 85%.

The efficiency of the photoclick reaction was investigated by extracting the resulting linear polymer from the siloxane network with DMSO. Liquid state 1H NMR was performed and the characteristic chemical shift of triazole was observed at 8.08 ppm (Fig. S5†). Conversion of the photo-click reaction can be calculated from the 1H NMR spectrum by comparing the integral values of the “e” and “e′” protons. We observed a limited conversion of 30%, which may result from a change in the irradiation conditions. The microwave lamp of the UV conveyor has a light intensity of 600 mW cm−2 per pass and generates more heat than the Hg–Xe lamp fitted with a lightguide used for RT-FTIR. Therefore the hydrolysis kinetics and consequently the condensation could be enhanced at the expense of azide conversion as demonstrated in Fig. S6.†
Conclusion
A concomitant light induced CuAAC click reaction and sol–gel photopolymerization was performed for the first time. The influence of each component in the formulation was thoroughly studied and cross-influences were established. The same photosensitizer can reduce copper(II) and produce Brönsted superacids to simultaneously initiate the click-reaction and the sol–gel photopolymerization. The kinetics study using RT-FTIR shows a faster hydrolysis of the inorganic precursor than the CuAAC reaction. A competition between photosensitisation by ITX of the photoacid generator (I250) and copper(II) accounts for this result together with the formation of a 3D inorganic network that restrains CuAAC reaction efficiency. NMR spectroscopy highlights the formation of the triazole cycle and the inorganic 3D-network. The proof of concept was established thus opening new opportunities for the synthesis of novel hybrid materials. This study opens new possibilities to synthesize hybrid materials by taking advantage of the competition between photosensitisation of PAG or copper(II) to promote sol–gel or CuAAC polymerization.
