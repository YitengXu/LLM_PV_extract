    AbstractNaGdF4:Yb3+,Er3+ submicron disks have been synthesized at a relatively low temperature in aqueous solution with citric acid as the structure-directing agent. The structure, luminescence, and magnetic properties of the synthesized materials have been characterized by a variety of techniques. The as-prepared NaGdF4:Yb3+,Er3+ has hexagonal structure, and is mainly composed of submicron disks with a diameter of around 870 nm and a thickness of about 420 nm. Citrate groups selectively bonded to a certain crystal surface of the nanocrystals probably provide the driving force that makes primary particles assemble into submicron disks. The phase structure of these submicron disks is affected by the annealing temperature, while the disk morphology could be essentially preserved even when annealed at high temperatures. The annealed submicron disks exhibit prominent visible emission with different excitation sources, including ultraviolet light, low-voltage electron beam and near-infrared laser. In addition, these disks exhibit paramagnetic features with the mass magnetic susceptibility value of 9.82 × 10−5 emu/g·Oe at room temperature. These multifunctional disks would have potential in applications as building blocks for many functional devices such as solid-state lasers, lighting and displays, magnetic resonance imaging and so on.
Introduction
Lanthanide fluoride compounds with the formulae of LnF3 and ALnF4 (A = alkaline metal, Ln = rare-earth element) have low phonon energy, high refractive index, chemical stability, and relatively low crystallization temperature. These compounds doped with trivalent lanthanide ions might possess prominent luminescence features such as high luminescence quantum yield, narrow bandwidth, long-lived emission, large Stokes shifts, ligand-dependent luminescence sensitization,1 and magnetic properties.2,3 The above properties make them have promising applications in light-emitting devices, displays, optical amplifiers, lasers and planar waveguides,4–7 biological labels and detection,8–12 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)2,3 and so on. It is well known that the optical, magnetic, and other properties often depend strongly on the morphology and various physical characteristics of the dispersed matter, in addition to its chemical composition.13 Recently, many nanostructured lanthanide fluorides with various morphologies including monodispersed LaF3 triangular nanoplates, fullerene-like nanoparticles and colloidal spheres,14–16 NaLnF4 nanopolyhedra, nanorods, hexagonal nanoplates, nanospheres,17–21 nanotubes,22,23 NH4Ln2F7 nanocages,24 and Na(Y1.5Na0.5)F6 nanorods25 have been prepared by a non-hydrate solution route14 and a hydrothermal synthetic route.26 However, rare-earth ion doped fluorides at submicron or micron scale have not been extensively investigated compared with nanostructured fluorides.27–32 Inorganic microcrystals with novel morphologies are of special significance in the understanding of the crystal growth behavior and potential technological applications in microelectronic devices, drug delivery, photonics, etc.27–33 Some physical methods like laser-interference lithography and reactive-ion etching have been used to fabricate semiconductor disks at this scale, but the equipment used in the fabrication is complex and the synthesis conditions need to be controlled precisely.34,35 Therefore, it is necessary to develop a facile and environmentally friendly synthesis procedure of submicron disks without a post-patterning process.
Tetra-fluorides AGdF4 (A = Li, Na) doped with rare-earth ions have been investigated as new efficient vacuum ultraviolet (VUV)-excited phosphors for mercury-free fluorescent lamps, silicon solar cells and plasma display panels.36–39 Also, NaGdF4:Ce,Tb is one of the most efficient green-emitting phosphors under ultraviolet (UV) excitation.40 On the other hand, these phosphors have been used to explain some luminescence phenomena like quantum cutting,41,42 up-conversion emission,43 energy migration and relaxation.44,45 The host Gd3+ ion, with seven unpaired inner 4f electrons closely bound to the nucleus and effectively shielded by the outer closed shell electrons 5s25p6 from crystal field,46 is an ideal paramagnetic relaxation agent because of its large magnetic moment and nanosecond time scale electronic relaxation time.2 It has been confirmed that GdF3 and Gd2O3 nanoparticles can be used as paramagnetic relaxation agents in MRI.2,3,47 In our previous work, the paramagnetic properties at 293 and 77 K and photoluminescence (PL) of GdF3:Eu3+ nanoparticles have been reported.46 Up to now, there are few reports on the magnetic properties of tetra-fluorides like rare-earth ion doped NaGdF4. Moreover, studies on the luminescent properties of inorganic host materials co-doped with Yb3+ and Er3+ ions under the excitation of UV light or electron beam are limited.48 In this paper, hexagonal phase NaGdF4:Yb3+,Er3+ submicron disks assembled from many primary nanocrystals have been synthesized at a relatively low temperature in aqueous solution with citric acid as the structure-directing agent. The morphology of the as-prepared submicron disks could be preserved even when annealed at high temperatures. The down-/up-conversion PL, cathodoluminescence (CL) and paramagnetic properties of the annealed submicron disks were investigated. These multifunctional submicron disks would have potential applications in many fields such as solid-state laser, lighting and displays, MRI, etc.
Experimental
Synthesis of NaGdF4:Yb3+,Er3+ submicron disks
NaGdF4:Yb3+,Er3+ submicron disks were prepared in an aqueous solution with citric acid as the structure-directing agent.5 Typically, 3.0 g of citric acid (99.5%) and 0.336 g of sodium fluoride (98.0%) were dissolved in 22 mL of distilled water to obtain a transparent solution. The pH value of the solution was adjusted to ∼6 by adding NH4OH (25%) and the solution was heated to 80 °C. Around 20 mL of nitrate salts of lanthanide ions (in total 2 mmol, the molar ratio of Gd3+:Yb3+:Er3+ is 39:10:1) was added to above solution under stirring and the mixture was kept at that temperature for 6 h. The suspension was cooled to room temperature, and the solid was separated by centrifugation, washed with ethanol, and dried at 70 °C for 12 h to obtain the as-prepared samples. Finally, some of the as-prepared samples were annealed at a desired temperature for 4 h, with a heating rate of 3 °C min−1.
Characterization
Phase structure of the samples was characterized by a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer (XRD) with Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 0.15406 nm). Morphology was observed using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, JEOL-JSM 6335F) and a transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEOL 2010). Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were recorded for KBr disks containing powder sample with a MAGNA-IR760 Spectrometer E. S. P. (Nicolet). Down-conversion and up-conversion PL spectra and lifetime were recorded using an FLS920P Edinburgh Analytical Instrument apparatus equipped with a 450 W xenon lamp, pulsed diode laser (975 nm) and a μF900H high-energy micro-second flashlamp as the excitation sources. Low-voltage CL spectra were obtained using a modified RELIOTRON III CL instrument. Spectra data were collected using an Ocean Optics USB4000 charge coupled device spectrometer. CL images were observed using an SEM (JEOL Model JSM-6490) equipped with a CENTAURUS detector (K. E. Developments Limited, Cambridge). Magnetic properties were measured using a vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM, LakeShore 7400 Series). All the measurements were performed at room temperature.
Results and discussion
Phase structure and morphology of NaGdF4:Yb3+,Er3+ submicron disks
The phase structure and morphology of the as-prepared and annealed samples were analyzed by XRD, FE-SEM and TEM techniques, respectively. Fig. 1 shows the XRD pattern of NaGdF4:Yb3+,Er3+ submicron disks (a) and the standard data of NaGdF4 powders (b, JSPDF No.: 27-0699). It can be seen that the as-prepared NaGdF4:Yb3+,Er3+ submicron disks have hexagonal structure with the space group P. The diffraction peaks are weak and broad, which is related to the low reaction temperature (80 °C). NaGdF4 with this structure has three crystallographic cation sites: a onefold site occupied by Gd3+ (1a), a onefold site occupied randomly by 1/2 Na+ and 1/2 Gd3+ (1f), and a twofold site partially occupied by Na+ (2h).38,49 The radii of doped Yb3+ and Er3+ ions are 0.1042 and 0.1062 nm respectively, approaching the value of the host Gd3+ ion (0.1107 nm).50 Considering the ionic radii values and charge balance, the doped ions presumably occupied the 1a and 1f sites in the hexagonal NaGdF4.

According to typical SEM images taken with different magnifications shown in Fig. 2(a) and (b), the morphology of as-prepared NaGdF4:Yb3+,Er3+ is polydispersed submicron disks, which are mainly composed of large disks with a diameter of around 870 nm and thickness of about 420 nm, and small disks. It can be seen from the high-magnification FE-SEM image (Fig. 2b) that the as-prepared submicron disks are composed of many primary NaGdF4:Yb3+,Er3+ nanocrystals. A similar procedure was used by van Veggel et al. to synthesize rare-earth ion doped LaF3 nanocrystals with a crystallite size below 10 nm.4,5 It is interesting to note that the dispersed rare-earth ion doped LaF3 nanocrystals were obtained when 2.0 g of citric acid was added to the reaction system containing a stoichiometric amount of lanthanide nitrates and NaF, while polydispersed NaGdF4:Yb3+,Er3+ submicron disks were obtained by assembling from its nanocrystals when 3.0 g of citric acid was added to the reaction system containing stoichiometric amounts of Gd(NO3)3, Yb(NO3)3, Er(NO3)3 and NaF. This finding indicated that any change of host, doping ions, and the amount of citric acid may result in different morphology and uniformity even when using a similar synthesis procedure. TEM images and a selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern were recorded to analyze the microstructure of submicron disks, as shown in Fig. 3. The TEM image taken from the edge of a submicron disk shows that the edge area is rough rather than smooth (Fig. 3a), which also implys that the submicron disks are assembled from many primary nanocrystals. The lattice fringes displayed in the HRTEM image (Fig. 3b) reveal high crystallinity of NaGdF4:Yb3+,Er3+ nanocrystals, and the interlayer spacing was determined to be about 0.52 nm, which corresponds to the {100} planes of hexagonal NaGdF4. The SAED pattern shown in Fig. 3(c) confirms the hexagonal structure of NaGdF4, which is consistent with the XRD results, and further indicates the polycrystalline characteristic of NaGdF4 submicron disks.

The presence of the citrate ligands at the surface of NaGdF4:Yb3+,Er3+ nanocrystals can be proved by FTIR. Fig. 4 (a) shows the FTIR spectrum of as-prepared NaGdF4:Yb3+,Er3+ submicron disks. The absorption band of hydroxyl groups at ∼3441 cm−1, the asymmetrical and symmetrical stretching vibration modes of CH2 groups at 2921 and 2849 cm−1, and the vibrations of the carboxylate anion at about 1614 and 1403 cm−1 arise from citrate groups adsorbed on the surface of NaGdF4:Yb3+,Er3+ nanocrystals.29 When the as-prepared samples were annealed at 500, 600 and 700 °C, these absorption bands are gradually weakened, and almost vanished at 700 °C, as shown in Fig. 4(b), (c) and (d), respectively. It is known that citric acid can be adsorbed strongly on metal and mineral surfaces and significantly alters the surface properties and mineral growth behaviour.51 Here, citric acid may play a crucial role in the formation process of NaGdF4:Yb3+,Er3+ submicron disks. First, the rare-earth ions are reacted with citrate groups in solution to form the rare-earth complex. Then, the F− anions compete with the chelators (citrate groups) to transform the rare-earth complex into the NaGdF4 lattice. In this stage, the nucleation rate of NaGdF4:Yb3+,Er3+ nanocrystals is strongly affected by the incorporation of F− ions into the rare-earth complex.52 Finally, citrate groups selectively bonded to a certain crystal surface of the nanocrystals probably provide the driving force (electrostatic, hydrogen, coordination bonds, etc.) that makes primary particles assemble into polydispersed submicron disks.29,53,54

The effect of annealing temperature on the phase structure and morphology was investigated. When the as-prepared NaGdF4:Yb3+,Er3+ submicron disks were annealed at different temperatures (500, 600 and 700 °C), the hexagonal structure of the submicron disks was changed, while the morphology of these submicron disks was mainly preserved. Fig. 5 shows the typical FE-SEM images of NaGdF4:Yb3+,Er3+ submicron disks annealled at 700 °C. It can be seen that the morphology of the submicron disks is essentially preserved, and the average diameter and thickness of these submicron disks are decreased to about 845 and 410 nm, respectively. The slight shrinkage of the submicron disks in diameter and thickness is possibly related to the decomposition of citrate groups capping on the surface of NaGdF4:Yb3+,Er3+ nanocrystals and the increase of crystallinity. Another obvious change is that the surfaces of these disks are significantly roughened as a result of crystallization. The high magnification SEM image of a single submicron disk (inset of Fig. 5) indicates that each submicron disk is composed of crystallites with 45–55 nm dimensions and some larger aggregates result from the fusing together of crystallites, which further confirms that the as-prepared submicron disks are assembled from many primary nanocrystals.

It is well known that NaREF4 (RE = rare earth element) exists in two polymorphs at ambient pressure i.e. cubic phase and hexagonal phase. In general, the cubic phase could transform into the hexagonal phase under heat treatment. When the temperature of heat treatment is above 700 °C, the hexagonal phase becomes converted to a disordered fluorite-like cubic phase.55 For example, the as-prepared NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+ nanoparticles synthesized by a co-precipitation procedure have a cubic structure, and the cubic phase is changed into the hexagonal phase when the material is annealed at temperatures between 400 and 600 °C, then the hexagonal phase is transformed back to the cubic phase when the annealing temperature is increased to 700 °C.8 In our reaction system, the hexagonal phase of NaGdF4:Yb3+,Er3+ submicron disks was formed at a temperature as low as 80 °C (Fig. 1), which is probably related to the complex of citrate groups with the rare-earth ions in solution. The XRD patterns of NaGdF4:Yb3+,Er3+ submicron disks annealed at different temperatures are shown in Fig. 6. Compared with the standard data of NaGdF4 powders with cubic phase (Fig. 6a, JSPDF#27-0697) and hexagonal phase (Fig. 6b, JSPDF#27-0699), it can be seen that the phase transformation of NaGdF4 from the hexagonal to the cubic phase occurred when the as-prepared samples were annealed at 500 °C (Fig. 6c), and the ratio of cubic phase increased with an increase of annealing temperature (Fig. 6d) and the process was mainly completed at 700 °C (Fig. 6e). The result that the hexagonal phase is transformed back to the cubic phase at 700 °C is consistent with the literature reported by Yi et al.8

Luminescence properties
Inorganic host materials (such as NaYF4, YF3, LaF3etc.) co-doped with Yb3+ and Er3+ ions have been extensively investigated as up-conversion PL materials because they emit green and red emission when efficiently excited by NIR light (∼975 nm). It is thought in general that materials co-doped with Yb3+ and Er3+ ions exhibit weak visible emission under excitation with UV light or an electron beam.48 In contrast, in the present work, NaGdF4:Yb3+,Er3+ submicron disks annealed at 700 °C exhibit intense green emission under excitation with UV light and a low-voltage electron beam.

Down-conversion photoluminescence. 
The emission spectra excited at 377 nm (red line) and 273 nm (black line) are shown in Fig. 7(a). Both emission spectra are similar in profile and composed of peaks at 512–534 nm, 534–569 nm and 643–680 nm, corresponding to 2H11/2 → 4I15/2, 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 and 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 transitions of doped Er3+ ions respectively. The intensity of the emission spectrum excited at 273 nm (host Gd3+, 8S7/2 → 6IJ transition) is much weaker than that excited at 377 nm (Er3+, 4I15/2 → 4G11/2 transition), which indicates that the transfer efficiency of excited energy from Gd3+ to Er3+ is relatively low. The excitation spectrum obtained by monitoring at 541 nm (Er3+, 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 transition) is composed of transitions of Gd3+ (240–320 nm) and Er3+ (350–500 nm) ions, as shown in Fig. 7(a). The presence of peaks of Gd3+ ions in the excitation spectrum indicates that there exists energy transfer between the energy levels of Gd3+ and Er3+ ions even though the efficiency of the energy transfer is very low. As shown in Fig. 7(b), the luminescence decay curve of Er3+ (541 nm) excited at 377 nm cannot be fitted into a single exponential function, but rather a double exponential function as I = A1exp(−t/τ1) + A2exp(−t/τ2), and the average lifetime is determined to be 0.36 ms, which is consistent with the value (0.33 ms) reported earlier.56 The photograph of NaGdF4:Yb3+,Er3+ submicron disks exhibits bright green emission under irradiation with 377 nm UV light, as shown in the inset of Fig. 7(a).

Cathodoluminescence. 
The low-voltage CL properties of materials are important for field-emission displays (FEDs), which are promising emissive displays realizing high resolution and low consumption of electric power.57 A few papers have been reported on the CL properties of fluorides, and the knowledge about the characteristic of low-voltage CL in fluorides is still limited. Recently, we have found the highly efficient low-voltage cathodoluminescence of LaF3:Ln3+ (Ln = Eu3+, Ce3+, Tb3+) spherical particles.6 Here, the low-voltage CL properties of NaGdF4:Yb3+,Er3+ were investigated.
Under the excitation of low-voltage electron beam (excitation voltage: 3.5 kV), the CL spectrum of NaGdF4:Yb3+,Er3+ submicron disks annealed at 700 °C is similar to the PL spectrum in profile, as shown in Fig. 8(a). Also, the luminescence photograph given in the inset of Fig. 8(a) shows intense green emission under excitation with a low-voltage electron beam. The cathodoluminescent image shown in Fig. 8(b) indicates that CL emits from almost all NaGdF4:Yb3+,Er3+ submicron disks. The CL intensity was found to be dependent on measurement conditions such as current density and excitation voltage. The CL intensities of NaGdF4:Yb3+,Er3+ submicron disks increase linearly when the excitation voltage increases from 2.5 to 4.0 kV at a current density of 69.9 μA cm−2, as shown in Fig. 9(a). It is known that the penetration depth of an electron beam into a particular specimen is dependent on the value of excitation voltage. The electron penetration depth (L) can be estimated by the empirical formula: L[Å] = 250(A/ρ)(E/Z1/2)n, where n = 1.2/(1 − 0.29 log10Z), and A is the atomic or molecular weight of the material, ρ is the density, Z is the atomic number or the number of electrons per molecule in the case compounds, and E is the excitation voltage in units of kV.58 According to the formula, the electron penetration depth of NaGdF4:Yb3+,Er3+ submicron disks at the anode voltage of 2.5, 3.0, 3.5 and 4.0 kV is estimated to be 16.3, 27.9, 44.0 and 65.2 nm, respectively. Hence, an increase in CL intensity with increasing applied voltage is due to an increase in the number of excited luminescence centers resulting from an increase in electron penetration depth.59 Considering the electron penetration depth at low-voltage condition, the submicron scale of NaGdF4:Yb3+,Er3+ and the morphology of disks are beneficial to achieving high packing density and low scattering of light, and improving the resolution of displays. Moreover, the obtained submicron disks will provide a convenient route to assemble emitters and phosphors into a FED system. The CL intensities also increase with increasing the current density from 21 to 106 μA cm−2 under the fixed excitation voltage of 3.5 kV, as shown in Fig. 9(b). This indicates that these submicron disks are resistant to the current saturation, which is important for FED application.

Up-conversion photoluminescence. 
For up-conversion PL, the relative intensity of green (∼550 nm) and red emission (∼660 nm) is affected by the annealing temperatures. The up-conversion PL spectra and the integral area ratio of red emission (630–710 nm) to green emission (510–570 nm) for samples annealed at different temperatures are shown in Fig. 10 and Fig. S1,† respectively. Under excitation with a 975 nm laser, NaGdF4:Yb3+,Er3+ submicron disks annealed at 500 °C exhibit weak red emission (black line in Fig. 10, it has been multiplied by 10), while the ratio of red emission to green emission is the highest (Fig. S1†). When the annealing temperature increases to 600 °C, the red emission strengthens prominently while the green emission is still weak (red line in Fig. 10), and the ratio of red emission to green emission decreases slightly (Fig. S1†). At 700 °C, the red emission decreases evidently and the green emission increases at the same time, and the ratio decreases prominently to 1.5, as shown in Fig. 10 (green line) and Fig. S1,† respectively. This indicates that the relative intensity of red and green emission could be tunable via altering the annealing temperatures, that is, the red emission decreases while the green emission increases with increase of annealing temperature.
 Fig. 10  Up-conversion PL spectra of NaGdF4:Yb3+,Er3+ submicron disks annealed at different temperatures. 
It should be denoted that both intensities of green and red emission in down-conversion PL spectra increase with increase of annealing temperature from 500 to 700 °C (Fig. S2†), which is inconsistent with that of up-conversion PL spectra. The difference in the changing trend of green and red emission may arise from various luminescent mechanisms of down- and up-conversion PL. In the former, under excitation with 377 nm UV light, electrons transferred from the energy level (4I15/2) of the ground state to the high energy level (4G11/2) of the excited state of Er3+ ions. The excited electrons relaxed to the low energy levels of the excited state of Er3+ ions, i.e.2H11/2, 4S3/2, 4F9/2, and then transferred to 4I15/2, which leads to the green and red emission. For the as-prepared samples, there exist some structural defects and organic impurities within the luminescent particles or on their surface, which could act as the non-radiative compound centers. Hence, both the down- and up-conversion PL of the as-prepared samples are very weak. When the as-prepared samples were annealed at high temperatures, the decrease of the amount of organic impurities with increase of annealing temperature, as indicated by FTIR, results in the improvement of luminescent intensities in both green emission and red emission. As for the latter, under excitation with a 975 nm laser, electrons transferred from the ground state of Yb3+ to its excited multiplet, 2F5/2, and the non-radiative energy-transfer step from Yb3+2F5/2 to Er3+4I11/2 energy level is resonant or near resonant and thus very efficient. Electrons in Er3+4I11/2 can be further excited to 4F7/2 by another Yb3+2F5/2 excitation.43 The excited electrons decay first non-radiatively to 2H11/2, 4S3/2 and 4F9/2 energy levels, and then decay further to the ground state of Er3+ to emit green and red emission. The presence of OH− and some organic remains such as the citrate groups, C–H, O–H and C impurities within the luminescent particles or on their surface may result in the non-radiative relaxation across these energy gaps of 2H11/2 → 4F9/2 and 4S3/2 → 4F9/2.43 The effect of non-radiative relaxation across these energy gaps decreases because of the decrease of these organic impurities at high annealing temperatures. Thus, the red emission for samples annealed at 500 and 600 °C is stronger than the green emission, and the ratio of red to green emission decreases with increase of annealing temperature. In addition, the relative intensity of green and red emission is probably affected by many factors such as phase structure, lattice defects and so on.

Magnetic properties
Besides down- and up-conversion PL, low-voltage CL, the magnetic properties of the as-prepared and annealed NaGdF4:Yb3+,Er3+ submicron disks were also investigated. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the paramagnetic properties of rare earth ion doped NaGdF4. Measurement of the magnetization as a function of applied field is shown in Fig. 11. It can be seen that the as-prepared NaGdF4:Yb3+,Er3+ submicron disks and sample annealed at 700 °C are paramagnetic. The paramagnetic properties of the Gd3+ ions in NaGdF4:Yb3+,Er3+ submicron disks come from seven unpaired inner 4f electrons, which are closely bound to the nucleus and effectively shielded by the outer closed shell electrons 5s25p6 from the crystal field.46 The magnetic moments associated with the Gd3+ ions are all localized and noninteracting, giving rise to paramagnetism.46 The mass magnetic susceptibility values of the as-prepared and annealed samples are determined to be 7.75 × 10−5 and 9.82 × 10−5 emu/g·Oe, respectively. These values approach those of Gd2O3:Eu3+ (1.3 × 10−4 emu/g·Oe)60 and GdF3:Eu3+ particles (0.94 × 10−4 emu/g·Oe).46 The magnetization at 20 kOe is around 2.0 emu/g, which is near to the reported value of the nanoparticles used for common bioseparation.61

Conclusions
Hexagonal phase NaGdF4:Yb3+,Er3+ submicron disks have been synthesized by a solution method at a relatively low reaction temperature. The morphology of submicron disks can be essentially preserved even when annealed at high temperature. This synthesis procedure is facile, environmentally friendly and may be extended to prepare other materials with submicron disk morphology. Under excitation with UV light, NIR lasers and low-voltage electron beams, these materials exhibit prominent down- and up-conversion PL, and low-voltage CL. In addition, these disks are paramagnetic at room temperature. The luminescence, paramagnetic properties, and the specific morphology make these submicron disks have potential application in solid-state lasers, lighting, FEDs, MRI and so on.
