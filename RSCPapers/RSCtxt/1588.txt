    , Accepted 5th February 2018First published on 15th February 2018AbstractMonocrystalline, low-defect density Si thin films were successfully fabricated via epitaxy with 1 minute rapid vapor deposition on a porous seed layer. Zone heating recrystallization reduced the surface roughness of the seed layer to sub-nanometer size. The critical effect of roughness on the defect density of epitaxial films was confirmed.
Recent development in monocrystalline Si (c-Si) solar cell technology is significant both for reducing the cell cost and for increasing the power generation efficiency. However, there is still great potential for further cost reduction.1–3 The recent increased efficiency is mainly due to technology that (a) improves the carrier lifetime via surface passivation, (b) uses higher quality crystalline Si, and (c) reduces wafer thickness.1,2 A challenge in achieving further cost reduction, however, is reducing the thickness of c-Si while maintaining its crystallinity. Fabrication of c-Si wafers is commonly attained by wire-saw slicing of a crystalline ingot or by a layer transfer process.4–20 Epitaxy and layer transfer (EPL) processes developed as fabrication methods for high-quality Si thin films involve epitaxially depositing a Si layer on a seed monocrystalline wafer with a thin sacrificial layer, and then detaching (or transferring) the epitaxial thin film from the seed layer.11–20 EPL on double layer porous Si (DLPS), in which a top low porosity layer (LPL) is the seed for epitaxy and a bottom high porosity layer (HPL) is the sacrificial layer, has been widely studied.11–20 In this process, a thin Si film less than 50 μm thick can be obtained with only a relatively small loss of Si, unlike the kerf loss in the wire-saw slicing process, and the base Si wafer can be reused to repeatedly grow epitaxial films on it. The downside of this process is that the cost reduction of a cell with an epitaxial c-Si thin film is limited due to the long process time and low conversion ratio of the gas source to the Si film by chemical vapor deposition (CVD). Even though the growth rate of epitaxial films via CVD has been increased to ∼10 μm min−1,21 the yield and process cost are still the critical issues, as well as maintaining a high quality of the epitaxial film.
Minimal deterioration of epitaxial Si thin films due to grain boundaries, defects and impurities is critical for their use in solar cells. The crystal quality and surface roughness of the top surface of the seed layer directly affect the crystallinity of the epitaxial Si film. In epitaxy on DLPS, a thick high porosity layer (HPL) is required to ensure reliable detachment of the Si thin film from the substrate, although this increases the risk of crystal defects and higher roughness of the LPL surface during anodization. A possible solution to the trade-off between the reliability of the detachment process and the surface roughness is thermal annealing of the DLPS surface.15–20 We previously developed the zone-heating recrystallization (ZHR) method, where selective heat treatment of the surface of DLPS creates a nanoscale smoothed surface.19,20 ZHR is a modification of our previously developed zone-melting crystallization (ZMC) method.22–24 In ZMC, c-Si is achieved by melting and crystallizing the Si surface in a line (using a lamp line heater) and then scanning in one direction. Due to the stability at the solid/liquid interface, the result is highly oriented Si without requiring any seed for crystal growth.22–24 In ZHR, high-speed thermal treatment below the melting point successfully decreases the surface roughness of DLPS by using a scanning upper lamp heater under a N2 gas atmosphere.19,20 By this ZHR method, the root mean square roughness (Rms) of DLPS is controlled between 0.2–0.3 nm.20
An improved growth rate of epitaxial Si films and a high Si yield by CVD are required for thin film c-Si solar cells used as low-cost power generation systems. Rapid vapor deposition (RVD) has successfully been used to grow epitaxial Si layers at a high deposition rate of ∼10 μm min−1, which is 10 times faster than that in conventional CVD, with almost 100% Si yield, by the evaporation of the Si source at >2000 °C.25 By applying surface heat-treated DLPS with ZHR to the EPL process by RVD, with only 1 min of epitaxy, we previously obtained 9 μm-thick monocrystalline Si thin films that could be detached simply by using Scotch tape.20 Because the effect of surface roughness on the crystallinity of an epitaxial film increases with faster film growth rate, controlling the surface roughness becomes increasingly important even at the nanoscale level to obtain high-quality Si thin films at high speed using a low-cost process such as RVD. Thus, both the crystallographic evaluation of epitaxial c-Si films at a growth rate as high as ∼10 μm min−1 by RVD and clarification of the effect of nanoscale surface roughness controlled by ZHR heat treatment on such films are needed.
In this work, we controlled the nanometer-scale roughness of the DLPS surface by ZHR and investigated the properties of Si thin films grown via RVD. Because the defects in both the surface and interior of the Si film critically affect the power generation efficiency due to carrier recombination, evaluation of the crystallographic properties, including defect density of the epitaxial Si thin films, is required. However, the effect of structural properties, such as nanoscale roughness, pore size and crystal strain of the seed layer, on the crystallographic properties of grown films, such as defect density of the surface and interior of the film or grain boundary, has not yet been clarified. Due to the flexibility and fragility of epitaxial Si thin films, direct electrical measurement of such films is difficult compared to that of the bulk wafer. In this study, we therefore focus on the crystallographic properties of such films. Here, the distinct effect of the nanometer-size roughness of a less than 0.4 nm-thick seed layer on the defect density was confirmed by electron spin resonance (ESR), and the quality of the monocrystalline Si approached that of the bulk c-Si wafer. Also clarified was the effect of selective heat treatment of the DLPS surface by ZHR on the crystallographic properties of epitaxial c-Si films.
The fabrication process used in this study for a monocrystalline Si thin film on ZHR-treated DLPS by RVD is described in detail in ref. 20. Briefly, DLPS was formed by two-step anodization of a monocrystalline Si wafer on a p-type monocrystalline Si (100) wafer (ρ = 1–4 mΩ cm) using a galvanostat (YR6163, Advantest) in a 1:1 mixture of 48 wt% hydrogen fluoride (HF) aqueous solution (Wako Junyaku Co.) and 95% ethanol (Kanto Chemical Co., Inc). First, an LPL was formed at 2 mA cm−2 for 415 s, and then an HPL was formed at 200 mA cm−2 for 5 s. Rms was evaluated from surface AFM images and the pore number density was evaluated from surface SEM images. Then, the resulting DLPS was heated by ZHR, as schematically shown in Fig. 1. First, the DLPS was pre-heated using a bottom heater (0–17.9 kW) for 1 min. The accumulated input electric power into the bottom heater (HB) was used to indicate the amount of heat supplied by the bottom heater as detailed in ref. 20. The sample was then heated using a scanning upper lamp heater (tungsten line lamp, 2.9 kW) at a given scan speed of 1, 5, or 26 mm s−1. The DLPS was again rinsed in 10 wt% HF to remove any native oxide. Si epitaxy by RVD on each DLPS was carried out as detailed in ref. 20 and 25. First, DLPS was heated to 1100 °C in a vacuum chamber, and then Si was deposited by heating the Si source at ∼2000 °C for 1 min. In this step, an intrinsic Si wafer was used as the Si source in order to evaluate the defect density of the epitaxial film by ESR. The Si film fabricated by RVD on DLPS was then detached by using Scotch tape.

Fig. 2(a) shows a cross-sectional SEM image of the prepared DLPS on monocrystalline Si with a 1 μm-thick LPL and a 400 nm-thick HPL, and Fig. 2(b) and (c) respectively show surface AFM images of DLPS before and after ZHR treatment. ZHR decreased the Rms of the DLPS surface from 0.39 nm to 0.23–0.30 nm. Rms depends on ZHR conditions such as the scan speed of the lamp heater and HB due to the effect of surface recrystallization and oxidation.19Fig. 3 shows cross-sectional SEM images of RVD-fabricated epitaxial films on DLPS before ZHR and after ZHR at two different scan speeds. For each sample, a 9 μm-thick, uniform epitaxial Si layer was formed on the porous layer. The ZHR treatment yielded a smoother structure of the cross-sectional surface (Fig. 3b and c). This difference in surface structure roughness of the cleavage plane indicates the difference in crystallographic properties such as defect density, and thus can be used as a qualitative indicator of film quality. The out-of-plane, in-plane X-ray diffraction spectra with rocking curves of the epitaxial films on the DLPS with the same three conditions are respectively shown in ref. 20, indicating that the epitaxial films were grown as monocrystalline films. Fig. 3(d) shows photographs of the EPL process by RVD on DLPS. With or without ZHR treatment, the Si thin films were easily detached from the DLPS using Scotch tape, and the obtained films have a mirror-like surface on both the top surface and the interface between the detached film and DLPS. Although monocrystalline Si films can be epitaxially grown on DLPS regardless of the heat treatment, clarification of the effect of heat treatment on film crystallinity is required to determine the applicability of such films as solar cells.

Fig. 4 shows the ESR spectra of the wafer alone (Fig. 4a) and those of the detached Si films grown on DLPS without ZHR treatment (Fig. 4b) and with ZHR treatment (Fig. 4c–f). Table 1 shows the spin density of these films. The defect density (calculated from the peak intensity and the film volume) was smaller for the films grown on DLPS after ZHR treatment. Each peak was composed of overlapping multiple peaks (321.5–322.0 mT, g = 2.004–2.006), possibly generated from the surface and from dangling bonds inside the Si films.26 The peak positions are different from those of an epitaxial film using P-doped n-Si as the source (as shown in Fig. S1 and Table ESI†), in which the peaks come from P and free electrons in the dopant (322.5–323.0 mT, g < 2.003).26

Fig. 5 shows the dependence of the spin density of the Si films on the Rms (Fig. 5a) and pore number density (Fig. 5b) of the DLPS surface. Because the spin comes from the dangling bonds on the surface or interior of the Si film, the spin density directly indicates the film crystallinity. The Rms of an epitaxial c-Si film grown on DLPS after ZHR was reduced to less than 10% of that without ZHR (Fig. 5a). A strong correlation between defect density and Rms was observed, compared to that between defect density and either Rmax or pore number density. These results confirm the critical effect of controlling nanoscale roughness via ZHR treatment on epitaxial film quality.

The ZHR treatment of DLPS effectively reduced the defect density of the epitaxial Si thin film even when the difference in Rms between DLPS before and after ZHR is as small as 0.1–0.2 nm. This means that the origin of crystalline defects in the epitaxial c-Si film is the lattice mismatch due to atomic-scale roughness and that the trade-off between film quality and the reliability of the detachment process is a critical issue. An epitaxial film deposited on DLPS via RVD without heat treatment therefore has a certain amount of defects due to the film's nanometer-scale roughness, which can be drastically reduced by surface heat treatment with ZHR. The spin density in the best epitaxial film is still one order higher than that in the raw wafer because of the smaller thickness (∼9 μm) and larger surface area of the epitaxial film. In other words, an epitaxial film has larger surface area due to its ∼9 μm thickness, and therefore the defect density of an epitaxial film is apparently reduced as much as possible by the ZHR treatment of the seed layer. The effect of the heat treatment of DLPS on the crystallinity of an epitaxial Si film fabricated via CVD has been widely discussed.15–18 H. S. Radhakrishnan et al. showed the effect of roughness and residual stress in heat-treated DLPS on the surface defect density (measured by SECO etching) of an epitaxial film grown via atmospheric pressure CVD.16 N. Milenkovic et al. also showed the effect of heat treatment on the roughness and crystal strain of DLPS and on the reduction of the surface defect density of an epitaxial Si film.17 In both studies, the DLPS was heated to ∼1150 °C in ∼30 min and had a surface roughness of 2–3 nm.16,17 In our ZHR process, however, an Rms as small as 0.2–0.3 nm was realized by rapid heat treatment of DLPS with a scanning lamp heater. As a result, the defect density inside the epitaxial Si film was reduced by one order of magnitude with the ZHR process even though the deposition rate was 9 times faster by RVD than by conventional CVD. The next step in achieving high-efficiency thin film c-Si solar cells is to include appropriate doping, anti-reflection and surface passivation technology in the entire fabrication process. Development of such technology is now ongoing. Furthermore, process times of less than 1 min for both ZHR and RVD will lead to a rapid fabrication process of c-Si thin films, which in turn will significantly reduce the process cost of thin film c-Si solar cells.
Conclusions
The effect of nanometer-scale surface roughness of a porous Si seed layer on the crystallographic properties of epitaxial c-Si films fabricated via RVD was directly confirmed. With rapid heat treatment by ZHR, the Rms of the DLPS surface was reduced from 0.39 to 0.23–0.30 nm. Even though the difference in Rms between a DLPS surface with and without ZHR was as small as 0.1–0.2 nm, the effect of ZHR is critical to reduce the defect density of c-Si epitaxial films to less than 10% of that without ZHR. An epitaxial film fabricated via RVD in 1 min has a certain amount of crystalline defects, which can be drastically reduced by ZHR treatment of DLPS. Cost reduction of c-Si solar cells will therefore be achieved due to reduction in material loss and the short process times of RVD and ZHR.
