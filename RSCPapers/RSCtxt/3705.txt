Introduction
Light-induced electron transfer processes in molecular assemblies constituting a sensitizer covalently linked to a catalyst are determining steps in their functioning. These dyads are designed to harvest light energy to trigger electron transfer processes. The challenge is to accumulate charges at the catalytic unit to perform multi-electron catalysis.1–3 Such a task is not a trivial pursuit. It demands among others the matching of the thermodynamic properties of the photoactivated chromophore with the redox properties of the catalytic unit. Another issue is to optimise the directional electron transfer while avoiding deleterious electrons or energy transfer side reactions. The aims behind are to use light and renewable sources to perform catalysis in a sustainable fashion. Henceforth, the right selection of each constitutive component is of primary importance. A prominent chromophore that is still used as a model compound in such supramolecular assemblies is the well documented [RuII(bpy)3]2+. Well-furnished literature is accessible with such a chromophore.4–13 On the catalytic side both reduction and oxidation reactions are under focus. Photocatalytic reduction reactions such as production of H2 have been investigated quite successfully and to a lesser extent photo-oxidation reactions. This is mainly due to the scarcity of robust oxidative catalysts. Recently, Meyer et al. and other groups have developed mononuclear ruthenium based complexes as molecular catalysts performing the four-electron oxidation of water. From a synthetic point of view, it was a less daunting task to covalently anchor a sensitizer to a catalytic unit such as [RuII(tpy)(bpy)OH2]2+ (tpy = 2,2′:6′,2′′-terpyridine, bpy = 2,2′-bipyridine). Along these lines, Rocha and coworkers13 have reported on the photo-oxidation of various benzylic alcohols to the corresponding aldehydes through a two-electron oxidation process. Hamelin and coworkers14,15 described the light-driven oxygen atom transfer reaction from the catalytic unit to sulphur organic substrates. More recently, Meyer has reported the photo-oxidation of water within such dyads.16 With the target to decipher the intrinsic light activation pathways occurring in such dyads, we have recently shown17 that the catalyst [RuII(tpy)(bpy)OH2]2+ could be activated either by an energy or electron transfer from a ruthenium trisbipyridine-related chromophore. We have clearly demonstrated that these processes were a function of the substitution pattern on the bipyridine ligand on the chromophore. As such, these studies raise the issue that understanding the light activation pathways is essential to optimise the observed photocatalytic activity in such supramolecular assemblies. In this paper we investigate the activation of [RuII(tpy)(bpy)Cl]+ through a covalently linked porphyrin. The interests for this family of sensitisers are multiple:18–23
– the very strong absorption of the Soret band in the 400–450 nm region, as well as a significant absorption in the 500–700 nm region (Q-bands), makes porphyrin derivatives well adapted to efficiently absorb the solar emission spectrum; a high intersystem crossing quantum yield (0.88–0.90 in polar solvents) resulting in the formation of a long-lived triplet excited state (10–30 μs) makes it well-suited for interaction with electron donors and acceptors;
– synthetic handles at the meso and beta positions of the porphyrinic ring allow tailoring of the spectroscopic as well as electrochemical properties;
– porphyrins, not containing rare metals, are conveniently suited for large scale applications.
In this work, the free base porphyrin was found to outperform the yield of light induced electron transfer in similar assemblies with ruthenium based chromophores in the presence of an electron acceptor. Mechanistic insights indicate the occurrence of a ping-pong energy transfer from the 1LC excited state of the porphyrin chromophore to the 3MCLT state of the catalyst and back to the 3LC excited state of the porphyrin unit. The latter, triplet–triplet energy transfer back to the chromophore, efficiently competes with fast radiationless deactivation of the excited state at the catalyst site. The energy thus recovered by the chromophore allows improved yield of formation of the oxidized form of the chromophore and concomitantly of the oxidation of the catalytic unit by intramolecular charge transfer. Such energy transfer processes have been evidenced in several multichromophoric systems leading to enhanced formation of long-lived triplet24,25 or charge separate states26,27 or were used for 1O2 mediated photooxidation reaction.28 The presented results are among the rare examples where a porphyrin chromophore is successfully used to drive an oxidative activation process where reductive processes prevail in the literature.
Results and discussion
Synthetic procedures
The synthesis of the dyads presented in this paper is shown in Scheme 1. A two-step reaction was used for the synthesis of the terpyridine substituted porphyrin H2-P-terpy. In the first step the carboxy-substituted terpyridine terpy-COOH was converted to the corresponding acyl chloride after refluxing in SOCl2. The addition of amino porphyrin H2-P-NH229 and reflux in THF in the presence of Et3N afforded H2-P-terpy. The free base dyad H2-P-Rucat was prepared by refluxing Ru(bpy)(DMSO)2Cl230 and H2-P-terpy in acetic acid. Finally metalation with zinc acetate yielded the second dyad Zn-P-Rucat. The synthesis of the two porphyrin reference compounds is shown in Scheme 2. Starting from amino porphyrin H2-P-NH2 and after reflux with benzoyl chloride in THF and Et3N, H2-P was obtained. Metalation of the porphyrin ring with zinc acetate afforded the second reference compound Zn-P. All new compounds were fully characterized by NMR experiments (1H and 13C) and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry.

Electrochemical and spectroscopic characterisation
The electrochemical properties of the dyads and reference compounds, investigated by cyclic and square-wave voltammetry, are reported in Table 1. For the dyad H2-P-Rucat the observed electrochemical properties correspond to those obtained separately for the constitutive units H2-P and Rucat. On the anodic side, waves at 0.93 V and 1.13 V correspond to the oxidation of RuIIIcat/RuIIcat and H2-P+/H2-P moieties, respectively, while on the cathodic side peaks at −1.09 V and −1.23 V originate from the reduction of the porphyrin and the bipyridine moieties. For the dyad Zn-P-Rucat, the first oxidation occurs at very similar potentials as those observed for each of the ZnP and Rucat components. This results in a two-electron oxidation wave observed at 0.93 V and similarly a two-electron reduction wave appears at −1.25 V.

The electronic absorption spectra of the compounds in chloroform are shown in Fig. 1. Reference compounds H2-P (left) and Zn-P (right) exhibit typical porphyrin absorption features with an intense Soret band (421 nm for H2-P and 425 nm for Zn-P) and moderate Q bands (516, 551, 591, and 649 nm for H2-P and 554 and 597 nm for Zn-P). These features are present also in the dyads, accompanied by the characteristic MLCT (515 nm) and MC (320 nm) bands, originating from the Rucat unit. It appears that the individual features of the two moieties are not significantly altered in the dyads, although the Soret band is less intense in the dyads. This perturbation has previously been observed in similar systems.31

The excited states of the dyads H2-P-Rucat and Zn-P-Rucat were characterised by steady-state emission and transient absorption spectroscopy and compared to those of reference compounds H2-P, Zn-P and Rucat. Upon irradiation of H2-P-Rucat at 590 nm, where 70% of incident light is absorbed by the H2-P moiety, the resulting luminescence spectrum in chloroform (Fig. S4, left, ESI†) shows bands at 655 nm and 715 nm, originating from the porphyrin fluorescence, and a small contribution to the 715 nm peak coming from the Rucat luminescence. However, the emission quantum yield is greatly reduced in the dyad (Φf = 0.0024, Table 2) as compared to the reference H2-P (Φf = 0.118). These results suggest the presence of an intramolecular reaction (energy or electron transfer) responsible for the deactivation of the singlet excited state of the porphyrin. From the energetics point of view, the energy of the 1H2-P excited state is not sufficient to drive reduction (ΔG = +450 mV)‡ or oxidation (ΔG = +110 mV) of the attached ruthenium moiety. However the singlet excited state of the porphyrin and the triplet 3MLCT of Rucat lie very close in energy (Table 2). Energy transfer between these two levels is normally spin-forbidden but, due to the strong spin–orbit coupling induced by the ruthenium heavy atom effect, this process is most likely responsible for the quenching of the porphyrin excited state. This mechanism has previously been observed in related porphyrin–ruthenium polypyridine dyads.31,33,34 Upon irradiation at 532 nm, where only 40% of the incident light is absorbed by the H2-P moiety, the fluorescence quantum yield accordingly decreases to Φf = 0.0012, suggesting that singlet–singlet energy transfer from the Ru 1MLCT excited state to the porphyrin singlet excited state does not operate because, otherwise, no decrease in Φf would be expected. Thus, steady-state fluorescence studies indicate that irradiation of the dyad results in the formation of a 3MLCT excited state centred on the ruthenium. Further evolution of this state in the dyads will be presented below. In the isolated catalytic unit or in a Ru-Rucat assembly the 3Rucat* state decays rapidly to the ground state (∼300 ps at room temperature).§ The fast excited state quenching on these Ru(tpy)(bpy) catalyst units represents a serious difficulty for its efficient activation by light.

Upon excitation of H2-P-Rucat with a 532 nm laser pulse, only typical features of the porphyrin triplet excited state35 were observed (Fig. 2a), as obtained for the reference H2-P under identical experimental conditions. The amplitude of ΔA in the dyad is about 60% of ΔA in the free-base porphyrin. However, formation of 3H2-P exclusively via intersystem crossing from the 1H2-P state should yield only ∼35% of the triplet porphyrin (ΦT).¶ This suggests that also the short-lived *Rucat is involved in generating the 3H2-P species, most likely by triplet–triplet energy transfer, which is a downhill reaction (ΔG = −340 meV). The diminished lifetime of the triplet excited state of the H2-P-Rucat dyad (2.5 μs) compared to the reference compound H2-P (25 μs) is assigned to the presence of the heavy atom effect of the ruthenium which enhances the spin–orbit coupling interaction.33,36 To sum up, light absorption in the H2-P-Rucat dyad, absorbed either by the chromophore or the catalyst, ultimately results in the formation of a triplet excited state, mainly localized on H2-P and having a lifetime of 2.5 μs (Scheme 3, left). These findings are in line with previous studies on the photophysical properties of porphyrin–ruthenium dyads.31,33,37–40 In the case of the Zn-P-Rucat dyad, upon irradiation at 555 nm, where 85% light is absorbed by the Zn-P moiety, the emission quantum yield is strongly decreased as compared to the reference porphyrin values. In addition, the emission spectrum exhibits, together with the porphyrin bands at 610 nm and 655 nm, a new broad band peaking at 750 nm (∼1.65 eV), 35 nm red-shifted as compared to the Rucat emission (Fig. S4, right, ESI†), indicating the presence of a low-lying emitting excited state. This band was red-shifted and enhanced in more polar solvent (Fig. S5, ESI†). Decay from this excited state, possibly due to the formation of an intramolecular exciplex, which is stabilised in polar solvents, may prevent the formation of the triplet excited state. As in the case of the H2-P-Rucat dyad, intramolecular electron transfer is endergonic for Zn-P-Rucat (ΔG = +120 mV) for either reduction or oxidation of the appended ruthenium moiety. Thus, in this case, quenching of the porphyrin singlet excited state may occur either by singlet–triplet energy transfer, which is thermodynamically favourable, or via the formation of an exciplex, which lies close (∼1.65 eV in chloroform, ∼1.59 eV in the acetonitrile/acetone mixture)|| to the porphyrin triplet excited state.

Upon irradiation of the Zn-P-Rucat dyad at 532 nm, the porphyrin unit absorbs 60% of light and the calculated fluorescence quantum yield is accordingly slightly lower (Φf = 5.6 × 10−4). Excitation with a laser pulse, as in the case of the H2-P-Rucat dyad, resulted in the formation of the porphyrin triplet excited state (Fig. 2b) with ΔA being ∼50% that of the reference Zn-P and no other intermediate was detected, suggesting that intersystem crossing from the 1Zn-P* excited state might be the only pathway to generate 3Zn-P*. In conclusion, light absorption in the Zn-P-Rucat dyad results in the formation of a triplet excited state mainly localized on Zn-P and having a lifetime of 1.9 μs. The different deactivation pathways in both dyads are summarized in Scheme 3.
Photoinduced electron transfer
Having assessed that light absorption ultimately produces in both dyads a porphyrin triplet excited state lasting about 2 μs, we studied the reactions initiated in the presence of a reversible electron acceptor (methyl viologen, MV2+) in order to investigate the possibility to oxidise Rucat by an intramolecular electron transfer reaction. In both dyads, excited at 532 nm, the triplet state was quenched by MV2+ with a rate constant close to the diffusion limit (∼109 M−1 s−1). The transient spectra recorded 1 μs after the laser pulse (Fig. 3) indicate the formation of the radical ion pair MV˙+ (positive absorption bands at 400 nm and 610 nm) and H2-P˙+-Rucat or Zn-P˙+-Rucat, respectively (the broad positive absorption band between 500 and 800 nm, on which negative bands due to the ground state depletion of the Q bands are superimposed). These spectral characteristics match well with those observed for the reference porphyrins H2-P˙+ or Zn-P˙+ and are consistent with the literature.41,42 However, after the initial formation of the porphyrin radical cation, a different behaviour was observed for the two dyads. In the case of H2-P-Rucat, the H2-P˙+ initially formed, evolved in 1.5 μs (Fig. 3, inset, kinetics at 665 nm and 500 nm) to yield the formation of RuIIIcat characterised by the depletion of the absorption band between 400 nm and 560 nm17 (spectrum at 10 μs), while the absorption due to MV˙+ (610 nm, inset) was only slightly decreased. Subsequent charge recombination between MV˙+ and RuIIIcat occurred in ∼200 μs. In contrast, in the case of Zn-P-Rucat, once the MV˙+ and Zn-P˙+ radical species were formed (Fig. 3, right), only charge recombination in 200 μs (inset) without distinguishable formation of RuIIIcat was observed. The difference between the two dyads is rationalised by considering their different electrochemical properties. Due to the higher oxidation potential of the P+/P couple in the dyad H2-P-Rucat a driving force ΔG = −200 mV is available for H2-P˙+ to oxidise RuIIcat, whereas in the dyad Zn-P-Rucat the available driving force for Zn-P˙+ to oxidise RuIIcat is close to zero (Table 1) and therefore an equilibrium is expected to be established between Zn-P˙+ and RuIIIcat.

Conclusions
The photophysical studies presented here indicate that in both dyads, excitation of either chromophore results in efficient formation of a triplet excited state centred on the porphyrin moiety. The interesting fact that the triplet excited state on the porphyrin chromophore unit lies lower in energy than the triplet excited state on the ruthenium catalytic unit allows back transfer to the chromophore of excitation energy which would otherwise be lost by rapid quenching on the catalyst. This triplet has a lifetime of ∼2 μs that can be intercepted by an electron acceptor. However, in the dyad Zn-P-Rucat, the metallated porphyrin radical cation lacks the driving force to oxidise Rucat, while in the dyad H2-P-Rucat the free-base porphyrin radical cation is able to trigger the first step in the catalytic cycle of RuIIcat generating the RuIIIcat species. Moreover, for the latter dyad, the photo-induced oxidation of Rucat seems to be very efficient. Using Δε ∼ −10000 M−1 cm−1 for Rucat and Δε ∼ 3000 M−1 cm−1 for MV˙+ at 500 nm43 once the H2-P˙+ signal has disappeared and Δε ∼ 600 M−1 cm−1 at 775 nm for MV˙+ (and Δε ∼ 0 for Rucat and H2-P˙+) at initial time, ∼2.0 μM MV˙+ initially generated are converted into ∼2.3 μM RuIIIcat. Considering the uncertainties in the extinction coefficients this indicates a yield close to unity. For comparison, in the case of the Ruchr-Rucat dyad previously investigated, the yield could be estimated to be roughly 0.3. Interestingly, another aspect by which the H2-P-Rucat dyad compares favourably to our previously reported Ruchr-Rucat system, in which Rucat oxidation (∼1.5 μs) is about one order of magnitude faster than in Ruchr-Rucat (∼20 μs) despite the fact that the driving force is more favourable (ΔG = −700 mV vs. −200 meV in the latter system). This suggests that kinetic factors are also important for the efficiency of oxidation of the catalytic site. Hence, our findings suggest that porphyrin chromophores can be valid alternatives to [Ru(bpy)3]2+ for efficient collection and conversion of light into oxidative power for the development of molecular models in artificial photosynthesis.
Experimental
Materials
Compounds terpy-COOH,44H2-P-NH2,29Ru(bpy)(DMSO)2Cl2,30 and Rucat45 were prepared according to published procedures. Tetrahydrofuran was freshly distilled from Na/benzophenone. All other chemicals and solvents were purchased from commercial sources and used as received.
NMR spectra
NMR spectra were recorded on Bruker AVANCE III-500 MHz and Bruker DPX-300 MHz spectrometers using solutions in deuterated solvents and the solvent peak was chosen as the internal standard.
Mass spectra
High-resolution mass spectra were obtained on a Bruker UltrafleXtreme matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) spectrometer using trans-2-[3-(4-tert-butylphenyl)-2-methyl-2-propenylidene]malononitrile (DCTB) as the matrix.
Electrochemistry
Cyclic and square wave voltammetry experiments were carried out at room temperature using an AutoLab PGSTAT20 potentiostat and appropriate routines available in the operating software (GPES version 4.9). All measurements were carried out in freshly distilled and deoxygenated benzonitrile with a solute concentration of ca. 1.0 mM in the presence of tetrabutylammonium tetrafluoroborate (0.1 M) as a supporting electrolyte, at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. A three-electrode cell setup was used with a platinum working electrode, a saturated calomel (SCE) reference electrode, and a platinum wire as a counter electrode. In all measurements the ferrocene/ferrocenium couple was at 0.56 V versus SCE under the above-mentioned conditions.
Spectroscopy
Ground state absorption spectra were recorded either on a Shimadzu UV-1700 or an Analytic Jena Specord210 spectrophotometer. Steady-state emission spectra were obtained by exciting H2-P and H2-P-Rucat at 590 nm and Zn-P and Zn-P-Rucat at 555 nm using a JASCO FP-6500 fluorescence spectrophotometer equipped with a red-sensitive WRE-343 photomultiplier tube (wavelength range 200–850 nm). Fluorescence quantum yields were calculated in chloroform from corrected emission spectra following the standard methods46 using 5,10,15,20-tetraphenylporphyrin (Φf = 0.11 in toluene)47 and 5,10,15,20-tetraphenylporphyrinato zinc (Φf = 0.03 in toluene)47 as references. Low temperature phosphorescence spectra were recorded in an ethanol:methanol (4:1) rigid matrix at 77 K using a Hitachi F-4500 spectrofluorimeter equipped with a liquid nitrogen sample holder. All transient absorption experiments were performed on an Edinburgh Instruments LP920 Flash Photolysis Spectrometer system incorporating a Continuum Q-switched Nd:YAG laser operating at 532 nm. The LP920 system is equipped with a 450 W Xenon arc lamp as the probe for the transient absorption measurements. In the time range 10 ns to 100 Ωs, the Xenon arc lamp was pulsed. Detection in the LP920 system is performed either using a Czerny–Turner blazed 500 nm monochromator (bandwidth: 1–5 nm) coupled with a Hamamatsu R928 photomultiplier tube (kinetics mode), or using a 500 nm blazed spectrograph (bandwidth: 5 nm) coupled with a water-cooled ICCD nanosecond Andor DH720 camera (spectral mode). Samples, having absorbances of ∼0.1 at the excitation wavelength, were purged with argon prior to each experiment.

          . 
4-([2,2′:6′,2′′-Terpyridin]-4′-yl)benzoic acid (terpy-COOH) (75 mg, 0.21 mmol) was dissolved in SOCl2 (2.8 mL) and stirred under an argon atmosphere at 80 °C for 2 h. SOCl2 was removed under reduced pressure and the resulting acyl chloride terpyridine was dried under high vacuum at 50 °C for 1 h. The resulting solid was dissolved in anhydrous THF (9 mL) and anhydrous triethylamine (0.1 mL) and H2-P-NH2 (55 mg, 0.07 mmol) were added.
