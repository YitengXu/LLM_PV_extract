    , Accepted 18th August 2017First published on 21st August 2017AbstractWe report several shape anisotropic molecules that contain two centrally placed 1,3,4-thiadiazole units, which vary from each other with respect to the number and length of the flexible chains at the termini. The number, position and length of the peripheral chains connected to the termini showed an impact on the thermal behavior of these compounds. The compounds with two terminal tails exhibited an enantiotropic smectic C phase, whereas the compounds with four terminal tails turned out to be crystalline. Surprisingly, among the compounds with six terminal tails, only the compound with a longer terminal chain exhibited a columnar phase with oblique symmetry. It is also to be noted that only compounds with six terminal chains exhibited gelation in long chain hydrocarbons. The xerogel of the hexacatenar with six n-decyloxy chains showed an entangled network of nanofibers of several micrometers in length. The aggregation behavior of the hexacatenar in the hydrocarbon solvent is mainly supported by the attractive π–π interactions of the aromatic cores and the van der Waals interactions offered by the peripheral flexible tails. The emission behavior is dependent on the number of peripheral tails and not on the length. Furthermore, one of the hexacatenars exhibited solvatochromic emissive behavior. This molecular design helps in the development of long molecular nanowires with a central conducting core and insulating peripheral sheath, which will be helpful for the application in organic electronic devices. The application potential of the columnar liquid crystal material was tested by the fabrication of organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) either as a single emissive material or as a guest material in a host polymer. Higher efficiency and brightness were noticed in the host guest OLED, which exhibited a technologically important bright blue emission.
Introduction
Liquid crystalline semiconductors seem to be a bright option for application in organic electronics considering their good solubility, processability and excellent reproducibility along with their ease of purification.1,2 In addition, the addressability of their molecular alignment and charge trapping by defects in thin films by thermal annealing provides a major advantage over amorphous polymers and organic single crystals. Liquid crystalline self-assembly, especially of thermotropic liquid crystals (LCs), demands an anisotropic molecular structure with chemically or physically incompatible molecular subunits.3 Conventionally, liquid crystals are designed with a rod (calamitic) or disc-shaped (discotic) rigid core connected with one or several flexible aliphatic chains. Over the years many nonconventional designs have been explored out of scientific curiosity and in a quest to obtain novel mesophases. Polycatenars or ‘phasmids’ are one such class of LCs, which form hybrid structures between calamitic and discotic molecular structures.4–6 Obviously, they exhibit LC phases that are common to both classes of LCs, like a nematic phase, a smectic or lamellar phase, a cubic phase and columnar phases.3 This depends on the number of flexible terminal tails connected to the rigid cores. Considering the organic electronics, smectic (Sm) and columnar (Col) phases are ideal candidates, as they are blessed with strong π–π overlap, due to their layered or columnar packing, which is useful for charge transport. Design of π-conjugated molecules containing strong donor (D) and acceptor (A) systems enhances the intramolecular charge transfer and also reduces the band gap, making them attractive for applications.7 They are considered to be interesting due to their improved technological applications in the area of organic solar cells, organic field-effect transistors,8,9 organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs),10 chemo sensors11 and crystal engineering.12–15 This molecular design also enhances the intermolecular interactions required for the self-assembly process. Incorporation of heterocyclic units into the molecular structure alters the molecular geometry, provides strong lateral and/or longitudinal dipoles, enhances the donor–acceptor interaction and alters the electronic properties of the molecules.16,17 Such weak forces help in the one-dimensional self-assembly of D–A systems in the presence of solvents leading to the formation of stable organogels, which have potential in the area of organic photovoltaics, templates for the growth of inorganic nanostructures, controlled release systems, energy transfer and fluorescent sensors.18 A combination of good luminescence along with self-assembled ordered structures is important in the construction of organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs), where they can be used as conductive and emissive layers of OLEDs.19 Further, it will be advantageous if the luminescence is not quenched in the aggregated state, as it will affect the device efficiency.20 As part of our continued efforts to combine luminescence with liquid crystalline properties, we have synthesized several luminescent polycatenar mesogens stabilizing Col phases.21–24 Among them 1,3,4-thiadiazole containing LCs have shown good luminescence and wide range mesophases in comparison with their oxadiazole counterparts.21,23,24 Some of these derivatives exhibited gelation, which was mainly driven by the attractive π–π interactions, leading to the formation of highly ordered structures over a long range.23,24 Recently, Li et al. reported a series of bi-1,3,4-oxadiazole derivatives with two alkyloxy tails, which stabilized the tilted smectic phases due to the intermolecular donor–acceptor interaction within the smectic layer.25 This is because in the tilted arrangement, there is more scope for the interaction of the donor moiety (trialkoxy phenyl) of one molecule with the acceptor moiety (1,3,4-oxadiazole unit) of another molecule. Interestingly, the hexacatenars based on this motif stabilized Col phases of rectangular symmetry and lamellar type.26 They have also shown that one of the hexacatenars can self-assemble to form nanoparticles and further to form helical nanofibers showing bright blue emission in polar solvents like DMSO. The same molecule exhibited gelation in ethanol with an enhanced emission.27 A bi-1,3,4-thiadiazole analogue with two n-tetradecyloxy tails was reported to exhibit a stable smectic C (SmC) phase over a wide thermal range.28 Tetracatenars and hexacatenars based on this molecular motif have not been published hitherto. In this paper, we report the synthesis and characterization of shape anisotropic molecules that comprise two centrally placed 1,3,4-thiadiazole units (electron deficient, A), which are covalently linked with peripherally substituted phenyl units (electron rich, D). This forms a covalently linked D–A–A–D system. The variation in the number and the length of the flexible chains at the terminal was expected to affect the self-assembly and photophysical behavior. Their thermal, photophysical and gelation behaviors are thoroughly investigated. One of the molecules stabilizing the columnar mesophase has been tested for its application in the fabrication of OLEDs.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
The synthetic pathway for the target molecules (1T/6–8, 2T/6–8 and 3T/6–8) and their precursors is represented in Scheme 1. O-Alkylation of ethyl-4-hydroxy benzoate, ethyl-3,4-dihydroxy benzoate and ethyl gallate with appropriate n-alkyl bromides yielded the corresponding alkoxy derivatives (4a–c, 7a–c and 10a–c). These esters were converted to the corresponding hydrazides 5a–c, 8a–c and 11a–c on treatment with hydrazine hydrate in ethanol. These hydrazides were then treated with oxalyl chloride29 in THF to obtain the bis-benzohydrazide derivatives 6a–c, 9a–c and 12a–c. After isolation these bis-benzohydrazides were directly refluxed with Lawesson's reagent in toluene, yielding target bi-1,3,4-thiadiazole derivatives 1T/6–10, 2T/6–10 and 3T/6–10 respectively. All the final compounds as well as all the intermediates were characterized by various analytical techniques such as 1H NMR, 13C NMR, IR spectroscopy, and ESI-HRMS or MALDI-TOF analysis (see ESI† for details).

Thermal behavior
Polarizing optical microscopy (POM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) were employed to analyze the thermal behavior of the new bi-1,3,4-thiadiazole derivatives. The preliminary evidence for the liquid crystallinity was the conversion of the crystalline sample to a shearable fluidic birefringent material on heating. The phase transition temperatures and the associated enthalpy changes were observed in the DSC traces and were in accordance with the POM observations. All the mesophases observed were finally confirmed by XRD studies carried out at different temperatures. The thermal behavior of all the target molecules is summarized in Table 1 and schematically represented in Fig. 1.

 Fig. 1  Bar graph summarizing the thermal behavior of compounds 1T/6–10, 2T/6–10 and 3T/6–10 (first heating scan, upper part) and reported oxadiazole derivatives25,26 (first heating scan, lower part). 
Thiadiazole derivatives 1T/6–10 with two alkyloxy terminal tails connected to the terminal benzene rings at the 4-position exhibited enantiotropic mesomorphism exhibiting calamitic mesophases. The crystalline sample of compound 1T/6 on heating showed a transition at a temperature of ≈223 °C (ΔH = 55 kJ mol−1) as noticed from DSC. At this temperature it becomes shearable to a birefringent fluid.
The high enthalpy changes corresponding to the phase transitions point to strong intermolecular association due to the presence of donor and acceptor moieties in the molecular structure. Further heating converted the birefringent fluid into an isotropic liquid at around ≈302 °C (Fig. 2a and Table 1). Slow cooling of the isotropic melt leads to the formation of spherulitic droplets which soon elongate to form batonnet structures and finally coalesce to form the broken focal conic domains (Fig. 2b). The width of the mesophase was found to be 80 degrees in the cooling cycle and it crystallized at 212 °C. Mechanical shear of the textural pattern leads to a Schliren texture, which is characteristic of the Smectic C (SmC) phase (Fig. 2c). However, to confirm the phase structure, powder XRD studies were carried out in the mesophase. The XRD pattern obtained at 250 °C showed a sharp reflection at a small angle with a d-spacing of 24.5 Å along with a diffused halo at a wide angle with a d-spacing of 4.68 Å (Fig. 2d). The first d-spacing corresponds to the layer spacing of the SmA phase, whereas the diffused halo at the wide angle corresponds to the packing of alkyl tails. The reduced d-spacing with respect to the molecular length (L) of 32 Å corresponds to the tilting of the molecules with respect to the layer normal (d/L = 0.8, tilt angle is 40°) (Table 2 and Fig. 2e).

Compound 1T/8 was bimesomorphic with a small width of nematic (N) phase along with the SmC phase. The nematic phase was evidenced by the presence of two-fold and four-fold brush defects in the same sample (Fig. 3b). The Smectic C phase was visualized by the broken focal conic texture (Fig. 3c), which on shearing transforms to a schlieren texture.30 The thermal range of the mesophase was greater than that of the lower homologue 1T/6. The phase was further confirmed by the XRD studies (Fig. 3d). Similar to the case of 1T/6, the d/L ratio observed was 0.74, which confirms the mesophase to be a tilted SmC phase.28 The higher homologue of this series 1T/10 was monomesomorphic and exhibited a shorter-range SmC phase as evidenced from the POM, DSC and XRD studies (see Fig. S55 (ESI†) and Table 2). It has to be noted that the XRD pattern shows the presence of two d-spacings at a low angle in a 1:2 ratio, and they originate from the molecular subunits. The d/L ratio was found to be 0.75, which suggested tilting of the molecules with respect to the layer normal. Tetracatenars 2T/6–10, with four hexyloxy, octyloxy and decyloxy tails connected to the terminal benzene rings at the 3 and 4-positions, turned out to be crystalline in nature. Surprisingly, the hexacatenars 3T/6 and 3T/8 were also crystalline (Fig. S56–S60, ESI†).

Compound 3T/10 with six n-decyloxy chains on cooling from an isotropic liquid showed a growth of leaf-like texture, which on further cooling transformed into a mosaic texture. This texture remained as such until room temperature, and no crystallization was noticed. The sample was not shearable at room temperature, confirming the frozen nature of the mesophase in the glassy state. From the temperature-dependent XRD studies, it was evidenced that the Colob phase was stabilized throughout the thermal range. For example, the XRD pattern at 70 °C exhibited several peaks in the low angle to middle angle region with d-spacings of 31.8 Å, 18.6 Å, 16.9 Å, 15.6 Å, 13.5 Å, 11.5 Å and 11.1 Å corresponding to Miller indices (02), (10), (11), (−13), (−14), (−15) and (14) of a Col phase with an oblique (p1 symmetry) lattice. Along with this, two peaks at the wide-angle region with the d-spacings of 4.97 Å and 3.86 Å were observed. They correspond to the packing of flexible tails and the cores respectively. The peak corresponding to the average stacking distance is quite strong, which signifies the enhanced intermolecular interactions within the columns. The lattice parameters derived from the reflections at the low angle were found to be a = 19 Å and b = 65.1 Å, with the angle between them being γ =77.6°. The value of γ, which is not equal to 90°, suggests that the phase under investigation is Colob with a 2D parallelogram lattice. The lattice area S and volume of the unit cell V were found to be 1210.2 Å2 and 4671.4 Å3 respectively. The number of molecules present in the unit cell, denoted by Z, was found to be 2. The packing of two hexacatenars to form a disc-like unit and their self-assembly into the Col phase can be represented as follows. From the XRD data it is clear that on average two hexacatenars could be packed inside the unit cell, by arranging side by side to ensure space filling (Fig. 5).31 These sets of two molecules, forming a columnar slice, later stack up to form columns, and further these columns self-organize in a 2D parallelogram lattice with p1 symmetry (Fig. 5).32 The XRD studies carried out at lower temperature, i.e. at 50 °C and 25 °C (Fig. S61 (ESI†), Fig. 4e and Table 3) also showed similar diffraction patterns and confirmed the existence of the Colob phase throughout the mesophase range.

Thus on looking at the thermal behavior of these three series, we can conclude that the length of the peripheral chain and the pattern of substitution determine the type of mesophases. Bis-thiadiazole derivatives 1T/6–10 stabilized calamitic phases over a wide thermal range. In comparison with the oxadiazole analogues reported earlier,25 these compounds exhibited higher melting and clearing temperature but with enhanced mesophase width (Fig. 1). The D–A–A–D arrays formed by the donor moieties (alkoxy phenyl) and acceptor moieties (1,3,4-thiadiazole units) force the molecules within the same layer to have intermolecular D–A interactions. This is possible only when the molecules are tilted with respect to the layer normal. Under such a condition the donor moiety of one molecule comes closer to the acceptor moiety of the other molecule, as shown in Fig. 6. Li et al. also suggested a similar explanation for the analogous oxadiazole derivatives.25 The tilt angle of the SmC phase for 1T/6–10 was almost 10° less than that of the corresponding oxadiazole derivatives. This may be due to the wide bending angle of 1,3,4-thiadazoles (164°) in comparison with their 1,3,4-oxadiazole (134°) derivatives.24 Tetracatenars 2T/6–10 turned out to be crystalline. Similarly, the hexacatenars 3T/6 and 3T/8 were crystalline, whereas compound 3T/10 stabilized the Colob phase. This means that tetracatenar design is not favorable to stabilize any calamitic or Col phases.
 Fig. 6  Schematic diagram showing the self-assembly of compound 1T/6 into the SmC phase, driven by the D–A interactions between the molecules stacked in the layers resulting in the tilt. 
In the case of hexacatenars, the length of the chain also matters, i.e. to provide sufficient space filling and nanosegregation. This again confirms the delicate requirements of molecular design needed for liquid crystalline self-assembly. Thus hexacatenars 3T/6 and 3T/8 are crystalline, whereas hexacatenar 3T/10 stabilizes the Colob phase, which freezes to form a glassy state at room temperature. In comparison with oxadiazole-based hexacatenars26 where all the homologues showed the Colr or ColL phase, here only the n-decyloxy derivative (3T/10) stabilized the Col phase with oblique symmetry.
Photophysical properties
The photophysical properties of compounds 1T/6–10, 2T/6–10 and 3T/6–10 in solution were examined and the details are summarized in Table 4. The absorption and emission spectra of all the compounds were recorded in a micromolar THF solution (Fig. 7). It is clearly visible that the absorption spectra for the solutions of all the compounds showed a single absorption maximum in the range of 361–380 nm, irrespective of the substitution. The single absorption band for these compounds corresponds to the spin allowed π–π* transition of the aromatic system. In comparison with similar 1,3,4-oxadiazole derivatives, these compounds exhibited a red shifted absorption and emission behavior.25,26 These bis-1,3,4-thiadiazole derivatives showed large values of molar absorption coefficients, indicating that the systems are highly conjugated. The values of the molar extinction coefficients (ε) of the bi-1,3,4-thiadiazole derivatives were in the range of 25000–29000 M−1 cm−1 for 1T/6–10, 31000–32000 M−1 cm−1 for 2T/6–10 and 36000–39000 M−1 cm−1 for 3T/6–10. The optical band gaps (Eg,opt) estimated from the red edge of the absorption spectra were found to be 3.02 eV, 2.89 eV and 2.94 eV for the three different series respectively. The emission spectra of all the compounds exhibited a single emission maximum (for 1T/6–10: 438–443 nm; for 2T/6–10: 467 nm; for 3T/6–10: 494–496 nm). The emission spectra were much red shifted in the case of 3T/6–10 and they also showed larger Stoke's shift in comparison with the other two series (Table 4). From Fig. 7d it is clear that progressive substitution of the cores with alkyl tails leads to red shifted emissions, as seen from the deep blue emission of compounds 1T/6–10, the cyan colored emission of compounds 2T/6–10 and the bright green emission of compounds 3T/6–10. The steady-state anisotropy values of the compounds did not show any general trend, but compounds 1T/6–10 exhibited larger values compared with compounds 2T/6–10 and 3T/6–10. The relative quantum yields calculated with respect to the quinine sulfate solution (0.1 M H2SO4) were found to be promising and were in the range of 0.37–0.57 (Fig. S62, ESI†).

We tried to prepare thin films of the compounds by spin coating the solutions of the compounds in chloroform on quartz slides. Compounds 1T/6–10 and 2T/6–10 did not show good solubility and film-forming properties. This may be due to the reduced number of solubilizing chains. Compounds 3T/6–10 were soluble nicely and formed good films on quartz plates. The solutions of these compounds (8–10 mM) in chloroform were spin coated at 500 rotations per minute (rpm) for the initial 30 seconds and at 800 rpm for the next 30 seconds. They were allowed to dry at ambient temperature. The absorption bands and emission bands of these thin films were found to be broad in comparison with their solution spectra (Fig. 8 and Table 5). The absorption and emission spectra of compound 3T/10 almost matched with the solution spectra (Tables 4 and 5). The thickness of the films was measured by the ellipsometry technique. From these values, the absorption coefficients of these thin films were calculated which were found to be in the range of 6.7–7.5 × 104 cm−1 (Table 5). On irradiation of long wavelength UV light, the thin films of these compounds in solution as well as in thin films showed visually perceivable bright blue to green emission (Fig. 7c and 8c).

In order to understand the behavior of the compound with respect to solvent polarity, photophysical studies of compound 3T/10 as a representative case were carried out in different solvents (Fig. 9 and Table 6). The absorption spectra did not vary much with respect to solvent polarity, indicating the nonpolar nature of the compound in the ground state. In contrast the emission spectra of compound 3T/10 showed a red shift on moving from nonpolar to polar solvents, which indicated the polar nature of the compounds in the excited state. The red shifted emission in the polar solvent is due to the reduced energy gap between the ground and excited states of the compound. This is in turn due to the presence of donor and acceptor moieties in conjugation, which leads to the delocalization of the electron cloud toward the acceptor side from the donor side. This leads to an internal charge-transfer state in addition to the locally excited state.24 The internal charge-transfer state is favored by the increased solvent polarity. Thus, the energy gap between the ground and excited states is reduced in polar solvents, resulting in a red shifted emission (Fig. 9).

Electrochemical properties
The energy levels of the HOMO and LUMO levels of the representative bi-1,3,4-thiadiazole derivatives were obtained by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and the data are tabulated in Table 6. The CV scans of the compounds displayed irreversible oxidation and reduction waves (see Fig. S64, ESI†). The optical band gap Eg,opt was estimated from the absorption onset obtained from the absorption spectra in solution. The energy levels of the LUMO and HOMO were determined by using the formulae ΔECV = ELUMO − EHOMO eV, EHOMO = −(4.8 − E1/2,Fc,Fc+ + Eox,onset) eV and ELUMO = −(4.8 − E1/2,Fc,Fc+ + Ered,onset) eV. Compounds 1T/10, 2T/10 and 3T/10 exhibited LUMO levels of −3.1 eV, −3.27 eV and −3.13 eV, and HOMO levels of −5.99 eV, −6.17 eV and −6.03 eV. The LUMO and HOMO levels of compound 2T/10 were found to be slightly lower than those of compounds 1T/10 and 3T/10 (Table 7).

Gelation studies
Considering the ability of the polycatenar 3T/10 to self-assemble into the Colob phase (in bulk), we were curious to study its ability to form self-assembled superstructures in the presence of different solvents. Thus, the ability of the compound to form aggregates was examined by mixing the compound 3T/10 separately in different polar aprotic solvents like chloroform, dichloromethane, tetrahydrofuran, dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), and dimethylformamide (DMF), polar protic solvents like ethanol, and n-butanol, nonpolar aromatic solvents like benzene, toluene, and m-xylene, and nonpolar aliphatic solvents like hexane, decane, dodecane and hexadecane (Table S1 in ESI†). The process of gelation involved three sequential steps. The first step was mixing the compound with the solvent in a sealed glass vial at room temperature. In the second step an attempt was made to get a clear solution by heating the mixture. The last step was to allow the solution to cool to ambient temperature. The formation of the gel was confirmed by the “stable to inversion of the glass vial” method, i.e. after inverting the glass vial if the gel was unable to flow, then it confirms the formation of a stable gel. The critical gelation concentration (CGC) (wt%), i.e. the minimum concentration necessary for gelation, and Tgel (°C), i.e. the thermal stability of the gels, were determined by the ‘dropping ball’ method.33 The compound 3T/10 was found to have a CGC of 2.0 wt% and Tgel of 42 °C. Further, we checked the gelation behavior of other compounds 1T/6–10 and 2T/6–10 in decane (Table 8), as we were interested in determining their self-assembly behavior toward the solvent.

These compounds got precipitated in decane after heat-assisted dissolution. Other hexacatenars 3T/6 and 3T/8 also formed organogels in decane. The gelation of these compounds is mainly supported by the aromatic π–π interactions, dipole–dipole interactions and hydrophobic alkyl chain interactions with the long chain aliphatic solvents. Further, we investigated the organogel of hexacatenar 3T/10 by extensive photophysical studies, microscopy and XRD studies.
The UV-vis spectrum of compound 3T/10 in 15 mM decane solution showed an absorption maximum centered at 374 nm, whereas the emission spectrum showed an emission maximum centered at 474 nm (Table 6 and Fig. 11b). The process of the organogelation was followed by fluorescence spectroscopy with respect to temperature. The emission intensity of compound 3T/10 decreased on cooling down the temperature from 95 °C to 5 °C, with a simultaneous red shift from 474 nm to 492 nm (Fig. 10a–c). There was a visually perceivable change in the color of the solution under UV light of long wavelength. The color change is from cyan blue in solution to bright green in the gel state with a reduction in the emission intensity (15 mM in decane, Fig. 10a–d and 11c). Thus, this phenomenon is aggregation caused quenching of emission (ACQ). The ACQ is due to the strong attractive intermolecular π–π stacking interactions, due to which the excited states of the aggregates come back to the ground state through non-radiative channels, leading to emission quenching.34–36 Similar aggregation quenching was observed in the case of thin films prepared by spin coating (Fig. 11c).

The solution to gel interconversion with respect to change in temperature was seen for numerous cycles of heating and cooling as demonstrated by the change in its emission intensity with respect to its emission maximum (Fig. 11d). The excited state fluorescence lifetimes of compound 3T/10 under the very dilute condition (20 μM) and at the CGC (15 mM) in n-decane were measured by monitoring their emission decay at 456 nm for the dilute solution and 492 nm for the concentrated solution (λex = 475 nm). The emission decay profile under the diluted condition can be fitted with the bi-exponential decay lifetime values of τ1 = 0.80 ns (α1 = 6%) and τ2 = 2.22 ns (α2 = 94%) indicating the presence of two-emitting species. The solution with higher concentration also showed the presence of two excited state species; however, the relative amplitudes (α) of the short and long lifetime components were found to be changed significantly, such as τ1 = 0.66 ns (α1 = 54%), τ2 = 4.25 ns (α2 = 46%) (Fig. 11e). This observation confirmed the formation of higher-order aggregates in the solution at higher concentration.
The morphology of organogel formed from the hexacatenar 3T/10 in decane was probed by different microscopic techniques like field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The xerogel under investigation was prepared by evaporating the decane solution of compound 3T/10 in air followed by vacuum evaporation for 2–3 h. The AFM images of the dry gel of 3T/10 exhibited a dense network of intertwined fibers of several micrometers in length and a thickness of ≈200 nm (Fig. 12a). These results were again supported through SEM micrographs of 3T/10, which also confirmed the entangled network of nanofibers (Fig. 12b). Furthermore, the structure and arrangement of the molecule in the xerogel was extensively studied with the help of powder X-ray diffraction studies. The XRD pattern for xerogel 3T/10 at room temperature showed several peaks at low and wide angles showing the crystalline arrangement of the molecules in the gel state. However, the indexation of the peaks at a low angle suggested the arrangement of the molecules in a columnar structure with oblique symmetry32 (Table S2 and Fig. S64, ESI†).

Electroluminescence properties
The ability of the hexacatenar mesogen 3T/10 to exhibit enhanced emission in the Col phase motivated us to study its application as an electroluminescent material in the fabrication of OLEDs. To evaluate the performance of this material in OLEDs, we have made three types of device architectures, which are as follows. Device 1: ITO/PEDOT:PSS (50 nm)/emissive layer (80 nm)/LiF (1 nm)/Al (120 nm). Here, 3T/10 was used as a single emission layer. Device 2: ITO/PEDOT:PSS (50 nm)/emissive layer (80 nm)/LiF (1 nm)/Al (120 nm). Here, the emissive layer was composed of 5 wt% 3T/10 as a dopant with PVK (poly(9-vinylcarbazole)) as a host material. Device 3–4 had the configuration ITO/PEDOT:PSS (50 nm)/emissive layer (80 nm)/BCP (6 nm)/Alq3 (35 nm)/LiF (1 nm)/Al (120 nm). Here, 5 wt% 3T/10 doped in PVK formed the emissive layer. Fig. 13 shows the energy level diagram of the materials used and the schematic of the device structure. ITO (indium tin oxide) served as a transparent anode. PEDOT:PSS (poly(3,4-ethylenedioxy-thiophene)/poly(styrene-sulfonate)) was used as the HIL (hole injection layer) which can smoothen the ITO surface, decrease the turn-on voltage, reduce the probability of electrical shorts and extend the lifetime of the device. PVK was used as the host material due to its excellent film-forming property and good miscibility with different emissive material.37,38 BCP (Bathocuproine) was used as the HBL (hole-blocking layer) to confine the reductant holes in the emitting layer which didn't recombine with the electrons in the emitting zone.39–41 Alq3 (tris-(8-hydroxyquinoline)aluminum) is widely used as a green emitting ETL (electron-transporting layer) material and in the present device architecture it was used to facilitate electron injection into the emitting layer. To improve electron injection, a bilayer cathode consisting of LiF (lithium fluoride) and Al (aluminum) was used, where LiF works as an EIL (electron-injecting layer). The key device performance data are summarized in Table 9. Fig. 14a depicts the current density–voltage–luminance (J–V–L) characteristics of the fabricated OLEDs. The OLED composed of 3T/10 as the sole emission layer (device 1) exhibits high drive voltages (Vonset, corresponding to 1 cd m−2) of 8.66 V indicating high charge injection barriers, a low luminance (Lmax) of 38 cd m−2, a current efficiency (ηc) of 0.11 cd A−1, a power efficiency (ηp) of 0.033 lm W−1 and an external quantum efficiency (ηEQE) of 0.07%. There was a slight increase in the device performance when a PVK:3T/10 (5 wt%) emitting layer (device 2) was used as an emissive layer. However, a drastic increase in the device performance was observed with PVK:3T/10 (5 wt%) as the emitting layer (device 3) together with BCP and Alq3 as a HBL and an ETL. The efficiency of device 3 was almost 9 times higher than that of device 1/2 with Lmax of 1118 cd m−2, ηc of 0.96 cd A−1, ηp of 0.29 lm W−1 and ηEQE of 0.62%. Also, the device showed a low Vonset of 5.73 V. The improvement in the device performance can be ascribed to the efficient transfer of exciton energy from the host material to the emissive dopant and/or a balanced injection of hole and electron carriers into the emission layer. Furthermore, the performance of the device was improved with an annealed emission layer (device 4). In this case, Vonset was further reduced to 4.89 V, with better efficiencies of ηc: 1.26 cd A−1, ηp: 0.43 lm W−1, ηEQE: 0.75% and Lmax of 1717 cd m−2 compared with device 3. All the fabricated devices emitted in the blue region when ITO was positively biased. The steady-state EL spectra (Fig. 14b) of the devices at the driving voltage of 15 V showed emission peaks at ∼490 nm. The emission peaks of the EL spectra are almost the same as compared with the thin film fluorescence spectra of 3T/10 (Fig. 14b), which implies that both originate from the same excited state. The devices exhibited excellent spectral stability over a wide range of operating voltages (Fig. 14c). The CIE chromaticity coordinates are determined using the EL spectra of the devices at 15 V. The chromaticity diagram is shown in Fig. 14d, and the CIE coordinates that are tabulated in Table 9 correspond to a bright blue emission. It is to be noted that the devices are unoptimized and further optimizations can lead to much better performance including the brightness and efficiency. Although there is an improvement in the EL in comparison with a bithiadiazole derivative reported earlier,42 there is further scope for improvement, by minor alterations in the molecular design and device architecture.

Conclusion
Several bi-1,3,4-thiadiazole-based shape anisotropic molecules have been synthesized, with variation in the number, length and position of the flexible chains at the terminal phenyl groups. The rod-like molecules, which had two terminal tails, stabilized a tilted layered or smectic C phase with a high tilt angle. This organization is driven by the donor acceptor interactions of the adjacent molecules within the layer. The tetracatenars were crystalline, while among the hexacatenars, the compound with six n-decyloxy chains stabilized the columnar oblique phase. It is noteworthy that only the compounds with six peripheral tails exhibited gelation in the long chain hydrocarbon solvent decane. This shows that the gelation is facilitated by the donor–acceptor interactions, attractive π–π interactions of the aromatic cores and van der Waals interactions offered by the peripheral flexible tails. These molecules exhibited a red shift in the emission with the increase in the number of peripheral tails, whereas the length of the peripheral tails did not have any impact. One of the molecules exhibited solvatochromism, where a red shifted emission with the increase in the solvent polarity was observed. In comparison with the solution state, the organogel and thin film showed aggregation caused quenching of emission (ACQ). Thus, we have established a structure–property relationship on the self-assembly behavior and the photophysical properties of these novel series of donor–acceptor molecules. This molecular design is able to produce molecular nanowires of several micrometers, with a central conducting core and insulating peripheral sheath, which will be helpful for application in organic electronics. The ability of the hexacatenar columnar LC to exhibit technologically important bright blue electroluminescence may increase the interest among the scientific community working in the area of liquid crystals and OLEDs.
