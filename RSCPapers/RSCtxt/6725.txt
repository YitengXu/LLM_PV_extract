    , Accepted 19th March 2015First published on 19th March 2015AbstractNumerous novel materials for the next-generation of energy storage and conversion devices have been prepared through simple and green methods to meet the urgent requirement for sustainable development. In this regard, lotus pollen, which is cheap and common biomass waste, can be used as a potential carbon source for developing efficient electrode materials with a unique structure for high-performance supercapacitors. Following this aim, we successfully prepared hierarchical and interpenetrating three-dimensional (3D) hollow MnO2/C composites via a facile and rapid dipping method, employing the renewable, cost-effective and widespread naturally porous lotus pollen as both the skeleton and carbon source. Benefiting from the synergistic effect between manganese dioxide and the porous carbon matrix, the composite has a high specific capacitance of 257 F g−1 at a current density of 0.5 A g−1 and a high energy density of 51.5 W h kg−1. In addition, the prepared composite exhibits good cycling stability even after 2000 charge/discharge cycles. The approach developed in this work directs the way to take full advantage of sustainable resources provided by nature, and opens up a novel route to design and prepare high-performance materials with greater potential applications in high-performance energy storage systems.
Introduction
Available sources of energy and their use are not only vital for economic development, but they also provide basic security to a country's modernization plan for the improvement of living standards. The global climate warming, scarcity of resources and ecological environment has become more and more serious with the development and progress of human society; as a result, human beings are paying more attention to solar, wind and other new, clean and renewable energy sources. However, the inherent characteristics of renewable energy sources (mainly wind and solar) determine the power and energy output which are often affected by seasons, weather and geographical conditions. In addition, the excess energy produced by renewable energy sources needs to be stored. To solve this problem, people must develop efficient energy storage devices. In many practical application fields, the most effective technologies for energy storage and conversion are fuel cells, batteries and supercapacitors.1–4
Supercapacitors, also known as electrochemical capacitors (ECs), have attracted sizable attention because of their huge potential for application in portable electronic devices, hybrid electric vehicles and transportation, because they provide higher power densities than conventional batteries and possess reliable cycling stability.5–7 For example, in regard to safety and reliability, ECs are already being used for the large-scale applications of the emergency doors of the Airbus A380, pacemakers and airbags.1 Generally speaking, supercapacitors are divided into two types according to the way they store energy: pseudo-capacitors (involving fast and reversible redox reactions) and electric double layer capacitors (EDLCs, based on ion adsorption on the electrode surface).8,9 As with all other devices, the performances of energy storage and conversion devices to a large extent depend on the materials they employ. Electrode materials can be divided into three classes: (1) carbon materials,10,11 which seem to be ideal materials for EDLCs in terms of their specific power and long cycle life; (2) transition metal oxides and hydroxides,12–17 which can provide a higher power density and a large specific capacitance due to Faradic reactions between electrode materials and ions; (3) conducting polymers.
MnO2 is widely regarded as one of the most promising materials for supercapacitors due to its low cost, high theoretical specific capacity and environmental friendliness. Nevertheless, a major problem is the poor conductivity of MnO2 (10−5 to 10−6 S cm−1), which hinders the power performance and energy density, and limits its wide application in the field of energy storage.18 To effectively utilize MnO2, efforts have been made to synthesize MnO2/conductive matrix composite materials, for instance, MnO2/Au,19 MnO2/Zn2SnO4 (ref. 20) and carbon/MnO2.21 In the various cases above, the MnO2/C composite materials possess a huge potential for the next generation supercapacitors. Great efforts have been made to develop carbon-based materials that are identified as electrode materials for industrialization. Active carbon, graphene, carbon nanotubes and others have been used for commercial production. However, the vast majority of them demand harsh synthetic processing conditions. At present, the synthesis of carbon materials from organic biomass has attracted strong interests. Inspired by the abundant, renewable and economic biological materials with unique morphological structures and wonderful functional characteristics, researchers have designed many novel multifunctional electrode materials by combining the advantages of the bionics with traditional materials. Biswal et al. recently reported on functional microporous conducting carbon, synthesized from dead plant leaves. This microporous carbon exhibited a relatively high specific capacitance of 400 F g−1 in aqueous 1 M H2SO4.22 Qian et al. prepared heteroatom doped porous carbon flakes by carbonizing human hair, which exhibited a specific capacitance of 340 F g−1 in 6 M KOH at a current density of 1 A g−1.23 Moreover, hollow porous MnO/C microspheres fabricated via a facile and green bio-template method yielded a specific capacity of 700 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 and gave outstanding cycling stability with a 94% capacity retention.24 Ren et al. prepared lightweight and high-performance MnO2 loaded biomass carbonaceous aerogel composites via a facile hydrothermal carbonaceous procedure, and the MnO2@AC composites displayed a specific capacitance of 123.5 F g−1.25 Apart from the above mentioned materials, fungus, coconut shells, chicken eggshell membranes, fermented rice, wood, cornstalk, yogurt26–32 and other biomass materials have been fully utilized for superior supercapacitor electrode materials.
With these in mind, we successfully employed a green and facile rapid dipping method to synthesize hierarchical and interpenetrating 3D hollow MnO2/C composites from natural porous lotus pollen grains as both the skeleton and carbon source, and explore the potential of the electrode material for supercapacitors. As a common biomass material, pollen is relatively cheap and can be used as a potential carbon source. Furthermore, the majority of pollens have a unique porous surface structure to enable sufficient contact and reaction with the reagent. The structure, components and electrochemical performance of this material were fully characterized. Due to the unique hierarchical interpenetrating 3D hollow structure, the prepared MnO2/C-3 composite possesses a high specific capacitance of 257 F g−1 at a current density of 0.5 A g−1 and high energy density of 51.5 W h kg−1. In addition, the MnO2/C-3 composite exhibits good cycling stability, even after 2000 charge/discharge cycles.
Results and discussion
A schematic illustration of the approach to fabricate the hierarchical and interpenetrating 3D hollow MnO2/C composite is shown in Scheme 1. As described in the experimental section (see ESI†), first, the protoplasm inside the pollen grains is removed by ethyl alcohol. Subsequently, 10 M H2SO4 solution is used as the dehydrant agent to pre-carbonize the pollen grains treated by the alcohol (see Fig. 2). Then, the pre-carbonation lotus pollen (PCLP) grains are dipped into KMnO4 solution. In a pH neutral reaction system, the reaction between KMnO4 and the carbon can be described as eqn (1):33 3C + 4MnO4− + H2O ⇌ 4MnO2 + CO32− + 2HCO3−(1)

Insoluble MnO2, formed via the above oxidation–reduction reaction, uniformly deposits onto the surface of the carbon-based material. Due to further growth, the nano-granular manganese dioxide becomes hexagonal shaped. Finally, a hierarchical and interpenetrating 3D hollow MnO2/C composite is produced by a simple calcining process under an inert atmosphere.

Fig. 1 shows typical XRD patterns of the PCLP, pure MnO2 powder and the as-prepared MnO2/C-3 composite. A wide diffraction peak occurs at about 2θ = 20°, which shows the amorphous carbon structure of the PCLP.34 Two weak diffraction peaks at 2θ angles of ∼36.8 and 65.4 indicate that the ramsdellite-type α-MnO2 (JCPDS 44-0142) has poor crystallinity, which was prepared by reducing KMnO4.35 In addition, the as-prepared MnO2/C-3 composite shows clear characteristic peaks at 34.9°, 40.5°, 58.7°, 70.2°, 73.8° and 87.8°. These intense peaks are well indexed to the (111), (200), (220), (311), (222) and (400) planes of manganosite-type MnO2 (JCPDS 07-0230). According to the Bragg equation, the interlayer spacings of the (111), (200) and (220) crystal faces are 0.26, 0.22 and 0.16 nm, respectively. Fig. 1(b) shows the TGA curves of the MnO2/C-3 composite and PCLP recorded in Ar. Water molecules in the pollen grains depart at around 170 °C. Nevertheless, about 77% weight loss takes place from 180 °C to 490 °C because of the decomposition of organic components. The MnO2/C-3 composite reveals a 12% weight loss below 180 °C, which corresponds to a loss of the physically adsorbed water and the crystal water from the composite with no variation in the chemical valence. There is also only a 5.5% weight loss between 180 °C and 580 °C, which is due to the partial decomposition of the organic components in the pollen grains and the loss of oxygen from the MnO2 lattice, leading to a phase transformation to Mn2O3.36–38 Potassium permanganate penetrates into the inner layer of the surface through holes and grooves on the surface of the pollen, and, as a result, reacts with the outside and inside walls. The generated manganese dioxide tightly anchors onto the internal and external surfaces of the pollen by strong interactions,39 and, most likely, prevents the organic components in the pre-carbonation pollen grains largely decomposing at high temperature. Therefore, compared with the pure pre-carbonation pollen, the weight loss of the MnO2/C-3 composite at high temperature is greatly reduced. In order to evaluate the value of the MnO2 to carbon ratio, thermal analysis was performed in an O2 atmosphere (Fig. S1†). The ash content of PCLP is 12.91 wt%. Consequently, it can be calculated that the amount of MnO2 in the MnO2/C-3 composite is about 62.89 wt%.

Fig. 2(a) shows that the PCLP grain, a natural kind of porous material, is a spherical granule with a diameter of about 50 μm. There are many holes, brain corrugation-like folds and grooves on its surface. Pleated inner and outer walls, connecting with the columella layer, constitute the hierarchical porous hollow pollen grain (Fig. 2(b) and (c)). Fig. 2(d) presents a high-magnification image of the smooth surface of the pre-carbonized pollen. Potassium permanganate solution infiltrates into the inner surface layer through these holes and grooves, effectively increasing the contact area between the potassium permanganate and the pollen walls. Hence, the utilization of the pollen grain walls is greatly increased. Of particular significance is the way in which the hierarchical porous hollow structure accelerates the diffusion velocity of the electrolyte ions and is, therefore, more conducive to the improvement of the electrochemical properties of the electrode materials.40

Fig. 3 shows the hierarchical hexagonal MnO2 uniformly coated on the inner and outer surfaces of the hollow porous carbon spheres. Clearly, the hollow spherical structure of pollen grains does not collapse, and the surface morphology has not changed after calcination. It is noteworthy that the hierarchical hexagonal MnO2 nanosheets grow along the direction of the folds and grooves on the surface of pollen grains. Fig. 3(d) reveals that the MnO2 nanosheets have a special hexagonal construction with a side length of about 500 nm. It is well-known that the interpenetrating 3D hollow structure is an ideal scaffold for the preparation of monolithic composite electrodes; as a result, the special structure of the MnO2/C-3 composite increases the ion diffusion rate and increases the contact area between the electrolyte and the electrochemical active sites to improve the utilization of manganese dioxide.41 At the same time, electrons can be quickly transferred to MnO2 nanoparticles that are strongly anchored onto the nanosheets by the underlying carbon skeleton. Therefore, the electrochemical properties of the overall MnO2/C-3 composite are enhanced.39 The typical TEM images in Fig. 3(e) and (f) clearly reveal that the hexagonal MnO2 nanosheets possess an ultrathin morphology and include many small nanoplates (∼30 nm), the side lengths of which range from 500 nm to 1 μm. The insets are the corresponding HRTEM and SAED patterns of the hierarchical hexagonal MnO2. The marked lattice fringes (highlighted by the red lines) and diffraction rings (polycrystalline structure of the as-prepared MnO2) are consistent with the above-mentioned XRD results.

Fig. 4 shows selected areas of the SEM elemental mappings of the MnO2/C-3 composite and the corresponding EDS spectra. The SEM elemental mappings of the selected red area in Fig. 4(a) reveal a uniform distribution of the elements C, O, Mn and K in the as-prepared MnO2/C-3 composite. The corresponding EDS spectra (Fig. 4(b)) further demonstrates the basic chemical composition of the MnO2/C-3 composite. It should be noted that the oxygen functional groups on the surface of the sample can absorb electropositive K+ ions in the reactant due to the effect of electrostatic forces. As a result, there are still a small quantity of the element K in the composite.

The XPS spectrum of the MnO2/C-3 composite in Fig. 5(a) shows that there are only three kinds of elements (Mn, O and C) present in the sample. Fig. 5(b) displays two characteristic peaks at 641.4 and 653.1 eV corresponding to Mn 2p3/2 and Mn 2p1/2, respectively. The binding energy separation is 11.7 eV, which indicates that the manganese is present in the 4+ oxidation state.23,39,42,43 The XPS spectrum of O 1s is shown in Fig. 5(c), which deconstructs into three components, indicating the presence of three types of oxygen-containing chemical bonds. The binding energy at 529.9 eV corresponds to the “oxygen” of the Mn–O–Mn bond, while the band at 531.1 eV is attributed to Mn–O–H (hydroxide) and the H–O–H (water molecule) is at 532.3 eV.44–46 In addition, the high-resolution C 1s spectrum (Fig. 5(d)) exhibits an sp2 peak (C–C), which centers around 284.2 eV. The other two peaks at binding energies of 285.6 eV and 287.6 eV are typical features of carbon in a CH3COH group containing the hydroxyl OH group and carbonyl or carboxylic groups (CO).47–50

Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) further assists in understanding the construction of the PCLP (Fig. 6(a)) and the MnO2/C-3 composite (Fig. 6(b)). The broad absorption bands around 3400 and 3310 cm−1 are assigned to the stretching vibrations of the O–H groups and the bending vibrations of a small quantity of adsorbed water molecules.51 Compared with the pristine PCLP grains (Fig. 6(a)), the two absorption peaks (2920 and 2840 cm−1) of the composite (Fig. 6(b)) are obviously weakened, which demonstrates that the surfaces of pollen grains have been covered by MnO2.52 The observed peaks at 1679 and 832 cm−1 in Fig. 6(a) which are ascribed to a stretching vibration of CO and δ-CH.43Fig. 6(b) shows the bands at about 1405 cm−1 are ascribed to the C–H in-plane bending vibration.53 The presence of C–O bonds in various chemical surroundings have been shown to be within the 1300–950 cm−1 range.54 It should be noted that the 1630 and 1120 cm−1 bands are normally ascribed to O–H bending vibrations combined with Mn atoms. In addition, two characteristic absorption peaks at 607 and 519 cm−1 are observed in the MnO2/C-3 composite, which are attributed to the Mn–O–Mn and Mn–O vibrations in the [MnO6] octahedra.52,55,56

In this study, the electrochemical tests of carbonized lotus pollens (CLP), pure MnO2 nanoparticles (the corresponding SEM images are presented in Fig. S2†) and MnO2/C-3 were tested in 1 M Na2SO4 solution (Fig. 7(a) and (b)). Obviously, compared with the pure MnO2 nanoparticles and the CLP, the CV curve of the MnO2/C-3 composite is expanded and quasi-rectangular in shape with the highest current response. The galvanostatic charge/discharge curve of the MnO2/C-3 composite is almost linear and symmetrical, demonstrating a rapid I–V response and an excellent electrochemical reversibility. The superior electrochemical performances of the MnO2/C-3 composite can benefit from synergistic effects between the electric double layer capacitive character of the hollow carbon skeleton and the pseudocapacitance mechanism of the hexagonal MnO2 nanosheets (eqn (2) and (3)).57,58 (MnO2)surface + Na+ + e− ⇌ (MnO2−Na+)surface(2) MnO2 + Na+ + e− ⇌ MnOONa(3)As the porous hollow carbon skeleton can overcome the poor conductivity of MnO2 (see Fig. S3†), electrons can be quickly transmitted through the carbon matrix to the manganese oxide nanosheets. In addition, the flaky MnO2 will increase the contact area with the electrolyte and provide a more convenient way for ion diffusion. The MnO2 nanosheets and the porous carbon skeleton could facilitate the utilization as an electrode; and, at the same time, improve the overall electrochemical properties of the composite.39 The CV curves for the MnO2/C-3 composite at various scan rates are shown in Fig. 7(c). All CV curves reveal a quasi rectangular shape in a wide potential range of −0.2–1.0 V, indicating ideal capacitive behavior for the as-prepared electrode materials. It should be noted that a few Faradaic humps are revealed at ∼0.3 V and 0.65 V in these CV curves, which are mainly attributed to the reversible redox reactions of the heteroatoms24 (sulphur atoms on the surface of pre-carbonized pollen grains, see Fig. S4 and Table S1†) and oxygen functional groups.59 Based on the works of Gogotsi and Zheng,1,60 the presence of small amounts of oxygen-containing functional groups are of benefit for enhancing the wettability and cycling stability of the carbonaceous materials. The capacitive performances of the MnO2/C-3 composite were further measured by galvanostatic charge/discharge experiments. Fig. 7(d) reveals typical galvanostatic charge/discharge curves of the MnO2/C-3 composite at various current densities. All of the galvanostatic charge/discharge curves are quasi-symmetrical with no obvious iR drops in the total potential range. The specific capacitance values of the MnO2/C-3 composite at the different scan rates and current densities are shown in Fig. 7(e) and (f). The specific capacitance calculated from CV curves is from 224 to 71 F g−1 as the scan rates increases from 5 to 50 mV s−1. This is because the electrolyte ions can take full advantage of most of the electrochemical active sites (the MnO2 nanosheets are located in the inner and outer surfaces of the hollow porous carbon skeleton) at low scan rates. Whereas, at higher scan rates, the movement of the electrolyte ions (Na+ ions and protons) is limited by a time constraint, and only the outer electroactive surface can be utilized for charge storage.61 Then, the highest specific capacitance value obtained from discharge time is 257 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1. Nevertheless, because fast charging limits the diffusion of electrolyte ions onto the electrode surface at high current densities,39 the specific capacitance decreases with an increase of the current density. The outstanding electrochemical performance is higher than those of hollow ε-MnO2 spheres (115 F g−1),62 carbon microsphere/MnO2 composites (181 F g−1),63 core–shell MnO2–MnO2/C composites (203 F g−1)64 and most highly reported carbon, biomass derived carbon or biomass derived carbon/MnO2 composite based materials (Table S2†). This satisfactory result demonstrates its potential application for high-performance supercapacitors. Moreover, the products of the different reaction times (the corresponding SEM images are presented in Fig. S5†) were also tested under the same conditions (Fig. S6(a) and (b)†). Compared with other products, the significantly better electrochemical performances of the MnO2/C-3 composites may benefit from the complete and unique structure.

Apart from the high specific capacitance, long cycle life or cycle stability is also an important parameter for supercapacitors. Fig. 8(a) shows the capacitance retention ratio and the Coulombic efficiency of the MnO2/C-3 composite electrode as a function of the cycle number. The enhanced capacity in the first two hundred cycles may be due to the improvement of ion accessibility in the 3D porous hollow carbon skeleton structure during the cycling procedure. Furthermore, the electrode materials may also be activated by long term high current density. The specific capacitance still retains 88% of its maximum after 2000 cycles, which shows that this MnO2/C-3 composite electrode possesses excellent stability. Moreover, the Coulombic efficiency remains as high as 94% after 2000 continuous cycles. This outstanding electrochemical stability is attributed to the hollow carbon skeleton preventing a possible volume change during long-time cycling.65Fig. 8(b) presents the cycling performance of the MnO2/C-3 composite at progressively varying current densities. When the current density increases from 4 A g−1 to 12 A g−1, the specific capacitances remain relatively stable and decrease regularly with a gradually enlarged current density; this means that the MnO2/C-3 composite possesses an excellent cycle stability after the electrode is subjected to a sudden current density change. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of the MnO2/C-3 composite was measured in the frequency range of 100 kHz to 0.01 Hz at an open circuit potential with an ac perturbation of 5 mV. Fig. 8(c) shows the Nyquist plots of the MnO2/C-3 electrode before and after 2000 cycles. The curves reveal a representative hybrid control process: an electrode reaction kinetics control (charge transfer process) at the high frequency region and diffusion control at the low frequency region.66 The as-shown impedance spectra are nearly similar in form, with an arc at the high frequency region and an almost vertical straight line parallel to the imaginary axis (Z′′) at the low frequency region. The electrical equivalent circuit presented in the top right corner of Fig. 8(c) is made up of Rs, Cdl, Rct, Zw and CL. Rs is the combined resistance of the intrinsic resistance of the substrate, the ionic resistance of the electrolyte and the contact resistance at the active material/current collector interface. Cdl is the double-layer capacitance of the composite. Rct is the charge transfer resistance at the interface between electrode and electrolyte. Zw is the Warburg resistance, which is a result of the frequency dependence of electrolyte ion diffusion/transport to the electrode surface. CL is the capacitance limit.27,39,67 The Rs of the electrode increases from 1.6 to 2.4 Ω. Only a slightly increase occurs in Rct from 1.4 to 2.1 Ω after 2000 cycles, which may be caused by the consumption of the electrochemical active sites. Fig. 8(d) shows the relationship between the total impedance (Z) and the frequency before the 2000 cycles. At the low frequency region, electrolyte ions attempt to penetrate deeper into the electrode by passing through the random stacking of the MnO2 nanosheet layers and the porous carbon skeleton. Hence, the resistive and the capacitive behavior can lead to higher impedance. The electrolyte ion penetration path decreases with the increase of frequency. That means that the impedance reduces at the high frequency region, which is consistent with the results shown in Fig. 8(c).22,68,69 These results, once again, demonstrate the excellent electrochemical performance of the MnO2/C-3 composite.

To further demonstrate the operable electrochemical characteristics, the energy density (E) and power density (P) of the as-prepared MnO2/C-3 composite were calculated from the charge/discharge curves at different current densities and are given in the Ragone plot (Fig. 9). It can be clearly seen that the MnO2/C-3 composite based electrode with a wide operating voltage of 1.2 V exhibits an energy density of 51.5 W h kg−1 at a power density of 303 W kg−1 and still maintains 20 W h kg−1 at a high power density of 7200 W kg−1 in a 1 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution. The high energy density in this study are not only comparable to those of MnO2-based composite supercapacitors,70,71 but also higher than most of the biomass-based supercapacitors.27,72–74

The superior electrochemical performance can benefit from the unique hierarchical nanostructure of the MnO2/C-3 composite: (1) the anisotropic morphology and hollow spherical structure create fast diffusion paths for the electrolyte ions, to enhance ion transmission and facilitate the utilization of the electrode; (2) well-dispersed MnO2 nanosheets can shorten the diffusion path of the electrolyte ions and ensure a high electrochemical utilization of the MnO2; (3) the porous carbon skeleton in the composite serves as a support for the deposition of the MnO2 nanosheets; at the same time, it can enhance the overall conductivity of the material and reduce the charge transfer resistance; (4) the unique stable hollow 3D geometric construction may prevent a possible volume change during the charge/discharge procedures and result in outstanding cycling stability.
Conclusions
Overall, our present work provides a novel, facile and cost-effective strategy to prepare hierarchical 3D MnO2/C composites by using renewable, green and widespread naturally porous lotus pollen grains as both the skeleton and carbon source. This MnO2/C composite was produced via a simple methodology involving a pre-treatment and a rapid dipping process. We found that the dipping time has a significant influence on the morphology and the electrochemical performance of the final products. After dipping the metal oxide/carbon material in KMnO4 solution for 3 h, the unique hierarchical hollow 3D structure exhibits a high specific capacitance and an energy density of 257 F g−1 and 51.5 W h kg−1, respectively. The synergistic effect between the carbon matrix and the manganese dioxide enhances the double layer and pseudocapacitive contributions. At the same time, the porous hollow carbon skeleton not only serves as a support for the deposition of the MnO2 nanosheets, but also improves the electrical connectivity among the MnO2 nanosheets. Moreover, the MnO2/C-3 composite exhibits good cyclic stability even after 2000 charge/discharge cycles. We believe that the facile, green and economical method presented in this work will set a good example for taking full advantage of sustainable resources provided by nature, opening up a novel route to design and prepare high-performance materials with a great potential application in high-performance energy storage systems.
