    AbstractType-II Cu2S–CdS core/shell (including Cu2S/CdS and CdS/Cu2S) semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs), which can produce efficient spatial separation of electrons and holes between the core and shell, were successfully synthesized. The results from absorption spectra, photoluminescence (PL) spectra, X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and PL lifetime measurements all confirmed the formation of the type-II core/shell NCs. The emission wavelength of the type-II Cu2S/CdS core/shell NCs can be readily tuned between 515 nm and 760 nm through two methods: core size control and shell thickness control. The highest PL quantum yield that the Cu2S/CdS core/shell NCs reached was ∼12% by controlling the shell thickness, while the core Cu2S nanocrystals had no PL at all. The PL decay data revealed that Cu2S/CdS NCs had a dual exponential characteristic and the PL emission with the longest lifetime (more than 1400 ns) occupied more than 85%. After overcoating ZnS, a Cu2S/CdS/ZnS core/shell1/shell2 structure was formed, which resulted in a blue-shift of the emission wavelength. Using the synthesis strategy of Cu2S/CdS, CdS/Cu2S type-II NCs also produced tunable emissions in the visible range.
Introduction
Colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs) have been enthusiastically exploited not only because of their unique size-dependent properties, which is referred to as the “quantum confinement effect (QCE)”,1–3 but also for their potential widespread applications in biomedical diagnosis,4,5 light emitting diodes (LED),6–9 lasers,10–12 and solar cells.13 The most significant achievement so far is the synthesis of high quality NCs with superior optical properties, such as color-tunable emission, high photoluminescence (PL) quantum yields (QYs), high color purity, and good optical stability, etc. Thus, in the past two decades, much effort has been devoted to synthesize different kinds of semiconductor NCs.14–16 Many groups have recently attempted to develop new methods to synthesize new kinds of high quality NCs with type-I or type-II core/shell structures.17–25
Based on the well developed type-I semiconductor NCs structures,17–19 in which both the conduction and the valence band edges of one semiconductor (sem 1) are located within the energy gap of another semiconductor (sem 2) (Scheme 1a), an increase in research focusing on type-II aligned nanostructures is perceived.20–25 In the case of type-II heterostructures (Scheme 1b), the lowest energy states for electrons and holes are in different semiconductors; accordingly, the energy gradient that exists at the interfaces tends to spatially separate electrons and holes on different sides of the heterojunction. As a result of this spatial separation, the type-II NCs provide an opportunity to obtain an optical transition with energy smaller than the band gap of both semiconductors forming the heterostructures, giving a way to tune emission colors. In addition, it has been found that type-II heterostructures also possess some unique properties, such as the giant bending effect,26,27 long radiative lifetime,28,30,41–43 and giant optical anisotropy.29 On top of their fundamental interests, type-II NCs should have a great deal of potential applications with the development of nanotechnology.

To the best of our knowledge, several combinations of semiconductor materials have been used thus far to fabricate type-II core/shell NCs, including CdS/ZnSe,20 CdTe/CdS,21 CdTe/CdSe,22,25 ZnSe/CdS,23 and CdSe/ZnSe,24 most of which were formed by II–VI group element semiconductors. There is still significant room for making type-II core/shell NCs with other semiconductor materials, such as in the most recent study on type-II core/shell TiO2/CdS nanorods.30 Copper(I) sulfide, Cu2S, thin film combined with CdS thin film has been extensively investigated as a solar cell material since the 1960s.31–34 More recently, Alivisatos' group reported the rational synthesis of colloidal copper(I) sulfide nanocrystals and demonstrated their application as an active light-absorbing component in combination with CdS nanorods to make a solution-processed solar cell displaying 1.6% power conversion efficiency with stability over a 4 month testing period.35 Comparing the energy band configurations of Cu2S and CdS, both the conduction and valence bands of Cu2S are higher than those of CdS (Scheme 1c).35 So it provides us a possibility to design new type-II heterostructured NCs based on Cu2S and CdS. In this work, both Cu2S/CdS and CdS/Cu2S core/shell NCs were successfully synthesized with proven type-II structures. In this Cu2S–CdS (Cu2S/CdS or CdS/Cu2S) type-II system, color-tunable emission was obtained no matter which one was used as core or shell even though there was no emission from Cu2S cores and only surface-state emission from CdS cores. Upon the deposition of CdS shell onto a certain sized Cu2S core, emission of the heterostructured NCs covered from 515 to 760 nm with more than 10% QY. With such heterostructured type-II Cu2S and CdS NCs, new kinds of photovoltaic devices can be fabricated and potentially used as new generation solar cells.35,36
Experimental
Materials
Cadmium oxide (CdO, 99.99%), zinc oxide (ZnO, 99.99%, powder), sulfur (S, 99.98%, powder), oleic acid (OA, 90%), 1-octadecene (ODE, 90%), dodecanethiol (DDT, 98%), sodium stearate (NaSt 90%) were purchased from Aldrich. Cupric chloride (CuCl2·2H2O, 99%), hexanes (analytical grade), and methanol (analytical grade) were obtained from Beijing Chemical Reagent Ltd., China. All the chemicals were used as received without any further purification.
Synthesis of copper stearate
The synthesis was based on a modified literature method.37 At first, 0.8524 g (5 mmol) of CuCl2·2H2O and 3.0646 g (10 mmol) of sodium stearate were dissolved in 50 mL of distilled water, respectively. Then CuCl2 solution was added into a sodium stearate solution (heated to 100 °C) under stirring. After 3 h, a slightly blue precipitated solution was obtained. And then the mixture was cooled to room temperature, the precipitated CuSt2 was purified by washing with methanol and distilled water several times. CuSt2 was soluble in hexanes. Finally, blue CuSt2 powder was obtained after the total evaporation of residual hexanes.
Preparation of Cd, Zn, Cu, and S precursors

Cd precursor: a mixture of CdO (0.1284 g, 1.00 mmol), oleic acid (2.8246 g, 10.00 mmol), and ODE (5.5160 g) was loaded in a reaction container and heated to 240 °C. Then the colorless Cd precursor solution (0.1 M) was obtained. Zn precursor: a mixture of ZnO (0.0814 g, 1.00 mmol), oleic acid (2.8246 g, 10.00 mmol), and ODE (5.5160 g) was loaded into a 50 mL three-neck reaction flask and heated to 280 °C with stirring. After 30 min, a slightly yellow solution of Zn precursor (0.1 M) was obtained. Cu precursors: CuSt2 powder was used directly to synthesize Cu2S/CdS core/shell NCs. But for CdS/Cu2S core/shell NCs, CuSt2 (0.0630 g 0.10 mmol) powder was dissolved in ODE (10 mL) at 110 °C to use as Cu precursor. S precursors: one precursor was DDT-ODE solution (0.5 M, dilute pure DDT with ODE); the other precursor was S-ODE solution (0.1 M), which was prepared by heating a mixture of sulfur (0.016 g, 0.5 mmol) and ODE (3.9400 g) to 120 °C with stirring. All the above stock solutions were prepared under nitrogen flow.
Synthesis of type-II Cu2S/CdS core/shell NCs
First, Cu2S was prepared based on a modified method reported in the literature.37 In a typical synthesis, 0.0063 g (0.01 mmol) of CuSt2 powder was loaded into a three-neck flask with 5 mL ODE. Under nitrogen flow, the temperature was raised to 210 °C with stirring. When the solution became clear, 0.05 mL S precursor [DDT-ODE (0.5 M)] was swiftly injected into the solution. The size of Cu2S cores was varied by changing the amount of CuSt2. The color of the solution turned slightly yellowish at first and got darker yellow as the reaction progressed. In order to prevent the Cu2S core NCs from growing bigger before the shell growth, excess DDT was used where the molar ratio between CuSt2 and DDT was 1 : 2.5.37 After 10 min at 210 °C, 1 mL Cd precursor (0.1 M) and 0.5 mL S precursor of DDT-ODE (0.5 M) were alternately introduced by dropwise addition. Cd precursor was added first followed immediately by S precursor. The time interval between every addition of Cd precursor or DDT-ODE was 8 min. The CdS shell grew thicker and thicker as the reaction time went on. In this process, type-II core/shell Cu2S/CdS NCs with different core sizes and shell thicknesses were obtained by changing the amount of CuSt2 with a fixed amount of Cd precursor and reaction time. In this paper we refer to the control processes as core size control and shell thickness control, respectively. The shell growth was monitored by PL spectra. When the desired PL peak position was reached, the reaction mixture was allowed to cool down to room temperature, and the as-prepared NCs were purified with methanol and hexanes.
Synthesis of Cu2S/CdS/ZnS NCs
The synthesis of Cu2S/CdS/ZnS core/shell1/shell2 NCs was carried out based on literature methods.19 Under nitrogen flow, the solution of Cu2S/CdS NCs (dissolved in ODE) was heated to 230 °C, at which point Zn precursor (0.1 M) and S-ODE precursor (0.1 M) were alternately introduced by dropwise addition. The time interval between each addition was about 8 min. The reaction was stopped when the desired shell thickness was reached, and the resulted NCs were purified with methanol and hexanes.
Synthesis of type-II CdS/Cu2S NCs
Typically, a mixture of CdO (0.0128 g, 0.10 mmol), oleic acid (0.3 mmol), and ODE (5.5160 g) in a three-neck flask was heated to 260 °C under nitrogen flow where 0.10 mL of DDT-ODE precursor was swiftly injected into this hot solution. The growth of CdS nanocrystals was monitored using absorption spectra. When the CdS nanocrystals grew to the desired size (indicated by the first excitonic absorption peak), the reaction mixture was cooled down to 210 °C for the Cu2S shell growth. The method of Cu2S shell growth was similar to the growth of ZnS shell in the above section. Cu precursor (0.1 mL, 0.01 M) and DDT-ODE precursor (0.1 mL, 0.5 M) were alternately introduced by dropwise addition. Cu precursor was firstly added followed by DDT-ODE precursor and so on. The time interval between each addition was about 5 min.
Characterization
Room temperature UV-vis absorption and PL spectra were measured with an Ocean Optics spectrophotometer (mode PC2000-ISA). X-Ray photoelectron spectrum (XPS) measurements were performed on a AXIS ULTRA X-ray photoelectron spectroscope, using monochromatised Al Kα radiation with an anode voltage of 15 kV and emission current of 3 mA. Phase determination of the products was carried out on an X-ray diffractometer (Philips X' Pert Pro) using Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 1.54 Å). TEM images of the NCs were obtained using a JEOL-100CXII microscope operated at 100 kV. PL dynamics were measured on a FLS-920 (Edinburgh Analytical Instruments) with an excitation wavelength of 365 nm. PL quantum yields (QYs) were measured relative to coumarin 540 (QY = 78% in ethanol) and rhodamine 590 (QY = 95% in methanol) and calculated using the formula QYNC = QYdye(INC/Idye)(nNC)2/(ndye)2, where I is the spectrally integrated emission intensity and n is the refractive index. The optical density (OD) values of the nanocrystal samples and organic dyes at the excitation wavelength were set the same in the range of 0.02–0.05.
Results and discussion
To investigate the influence of different type-II Cu2S/CdS core/shell NCs (different core sizes and different shell thicknesses) and different reaction temperatures on the emission wavelength, we performed experiments with several different molar ratios between CuSt2 and Cd precursor. Fig. 1 shows the absorption and PL spectra of the Cu2S/CdS core/shell NCs from a typical reaction with different molar ratios between CuSt2 and Cd precursor at different temperatures. The emission wavelength can be tuned from 515 nm to 760 nm by changing the amount of CuSt2 and Cd precursor at different temperatures. Fig. 1a, c show the absorption and Fig. 1b, d show the PL spectra of Cu2S/CdS core/shell NCs with different shell thicknesses and different core sizes, respectively. It can be seen that the emission wavelength can be tuned not only by changing the thicknesses of the CdS shells but also the sizes of the Cu2S cores. In general, it was found that the reaction temperature greatly affected the growth of the shells. For example, with reaction time constant (110 min), a higher temperature (230 °C) resulted in a red shift in PL emission to 760 nm compared to 664 nm at a lower temperature (190 °C) (Fig. 1e). We attributed this PL emission difference to the different growth rates of CdS shell at different temperatures. All of the above optic characteristics were due to the quantum size effects of Cu2S cores and CdS shells. First, due to the quantum size effect, the thicker the CdS shells deposited on Cu2S cores the narrower the band-gap of CdS NCs, that is to say, CdS's conduction band and Cu2S's valence band were closer. The expressional optic phenomenon was that the emission wavelength can be tuned by shell thickness control (Scheme 1d). Second, the core size control was similar to the shell thickness control, with the Cu2S cores becoming bigger, the distance between the Cu2S's valence band and CdS's conduction turned narrower. Meanwhile, we synthesized CdS/Cu2S and similar results were achieved in which the optical property of CdS/Cu2S can also be regulated through changing the sizes of cores or thicknesses of shells. The slight discrepancy between them was that if the sizes of CdS cores was fixed and as the Cu2S shell thickened, the position of the absorption peak did not move, but showed the strength weakened and a longer PL wavelength (Fig. 2a,b). As shown in Fig. 2c and 2d, when the CdS core became bigger, the PL wavelength red-shifted to longer wavelength. Additionally, from Fig. 2d we noticed that the reaction speed between Cu precursor and DDT was so rapid that the PL peak position hardly changed between the former time addition of Cu precursor and the latter.

We used several techniques to characterize the structure, crystallinity, and composition of as-prepared Cu2S/CdS NCs. Fig. 3 shows the XPS spectra of Cu2S particles (sample 1), thinner CdS shell with bigger Cu2S core (sample 2) and thicker CdS shell with smaller Cu2S core NCs (sample 3). As shown in Fig. 3a, we examined the Cu 2p, Cd 3d, and S 2p of the samples, respectively (the corresponding binding energy was labelled as b', c' and d' in Fig. 3a). In Fig. 3b, 3c and 3d are the enlarged view of b', c' and d', respectively. The signal of S 2p was observed in all of the three samples (Fig. 3d), whereas, the signal of Cu 2p was not detected in thicker CdS shell with smaller Cu2S core Cu2S/CdS NCs samples and it was weaker in thinner CdS shell with bigger Cu2S core Cu2S/CdS NCs than in Cu2S (Fig. 3b). This should be reasonable in view of the definite detecting deepness the XPS could test. When Cu2S was coated with CdS shell, the Cu 2p signal was weakened with an increase in shell thickness and finally disappeared. The binding energies of Cu 2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2 for Cu2S core were 931 eV and 951 eV, and no “shake-up” peaks were found in the higher binding energy direction, which was consistent with the standard reference XPS spectrum of Cu 2p in Cu2S. It is clear that Cu2+ in CuSt2 changed to Cu1+ in Cu2S when the reaction between CuSt2 and DDT happened (Fig. S1, ESI†). The binding energies of 403 eV and 410 eV in the spectrum of Cu2S/CdS NCs were ascribed to Cd 3d5/2 and Cd 3d3/2 of CdS shell. As seen in Fig. 3a, it was found that all of the three samples had sharp bands at 283 eV, which were assigned to the C 1s of organic compounds existing on the surfaces of the samples.

To identify the structure of NCs, we investigated the crystallographic properties by X-ray diffraction (XRD). Fig. 4a shows the XRD patterns of several samples of Cu2S/CdS NCs with different Cu2S core sizes. Basically, the peak positions match the theoretical values of zinc blende CdS. It can be seen that the peaks gradually broaden with decreased amount of CuSt2. Taking other conditions controlled as constant except the amount of CuSt2 into account, it can be easily concluded that the amount of CuSt2 caused this broadening. The lower the amount of CuSt2 that was used, the smaller the size of Cu2S/CdS NCs was obtained in the same reaction time with peak broadening. Herein the Cu2S can be regarded as seed and we can obtain different sizes of particles through modulating of the seed's size. That is to say, the size of the Cu2S/CdS NCs can be tailored not only by shell-control, but also by core-control, so as to obtain tunable emission.

(b) Powder XRD patterns and TEM images of Cu2S core (top), Cu2S/CdS (middle) and Cu2S/CdS/ZnS (bottom). 
In order to further increase the PL stability of the Cu2S/CdS structure, ZnS shells were successively overcoated on the as-prepared Cu2S/CdS cores/shell NCs. Fig. 4b shows the XRD patterns and TEM images of Cu2S core, Cu2S/CdS core/shell, and Cu2S/CdS/ZnS core/shell1/shell2 NCs. A smaller Cu2S core (∼3 nm) was used to grow the Cu2S/CdS/ZnS core/shell1/shell2 structure, so the diffraction peaks of Cu2S core were very broad. In our previous report, larger sized Cu2S NCs were obtained if more CuSt2 was used and a longer reaction time introduced.37 With the growth of ZnS (shell2), the corresponding diffraction peaks shifted to larger angles compared with CdS crystals, being consistent with the lattice constant between CdS and ZnS. In addition, the diffraction peaks narrowed, indicating that the crystalline domain was larger for the core/shell1/shell2, which provided direct evidence of epitaxial growth mode of the shell. Furthermore, due to the growth of very thin Cu2S shell on CdS core, the XRD pattern of CdS/Cu2S core/shell nanocrystals did not show the characteristic diffraction profiles of Cu2S and kept the pattern of CdS. TEM observations were also employed to study the morphology of as-prepared NCs. It can be seen that all the NCs are basically spherical shaped. We determined a mean diameter of ∼3.1 nm for the bare Cu2S core, which increased to ∼4.2 nm after overcoating CdS, and the Cu2S/CdS NCs grew to ∼5.5 nm after addition of ZnS shell. Interestingly, PL emission of the Cu2S/CdS/ZnS core/shell1/shell2 NCs in this study were blue-shifted when compared with emission from the Cu2S/CdS itself (Fig. 1f), which was an opposite tendency to the core/shell NCs produced by the epitaxial ZnS shell growth on CdSe or CdS cores previously reported.38 It is presumed that the blue-shift in PL emission might originate from the intradiffusion of Zn atoms from the ZnS shell layer into the CdS layer, which has also been observed in the cases of Cd1−xZnxS/ZnS and CdSe/ZnSe at higher reaction temperature above 300 °C.39,40
To verify these probably existing radiation mechanisms, the radiative lifetime of PL emission was introduced. Different radiative lifetimes may correspond to different electron–hole recombination mechanisms. Time-resolved techniques are most suitable for probing the lifetime of PL emission.41–44 Many have reported on the study of CdS PL decay, but none have reported on Cu2S/CdS core/shell NCs yet. The typical decay times for CdS ranged from ten or more nanoseconds to dozens of nanoseconds.45,46Fig. 5 shows the representative PL decay curves of Cu2S/CdS NCs, which were probed at different emission wavelengths. The time decays can be well fitted with a biexponential model described by I(t) = B1exp(−t/τ1) + B2exp(−t/τ2), where τ1 (τ2) represents the decay time of the PL emission; B1 (B2) represents the amplitude of the decay components at t = 0. The constants obtained by the fitting are shown in Table 1, with τ1 ranging from 150 to 350 ns and τ2 staying at more than 1400 ns. In all the PL wavelengths of the Cu2S/CdS sample, the amplitude A2 with radiative lifetime of more than 1400 ns accounts for a large amount (more than 85%) of the total PL emission. Previous PL decay investigations of type-II NCs have revealed that the decay lifetime of type-II NCs was significantly larger than that of the corresponding core or shell.30,41–43 So the longer lifetime can be attributed to the slow electron–hole recombination of the excitons in Cu2S/CdS type-II NCs. However, the origin of the fast component which accounts for a small amount (less than 15%) was not clear. One of the probable explanations was that the short luminescence lifetime (150 to ∼350 ns) was attributed to a donor–acceptor transition, which could be deduced from the broad emission peaks (fwhm is ca. 100 nm) and low quantum efficiency.44

Conclusions
A synthetic procedure for the production of Cu2S/CdS type-II NCs whose emission spans more than half of the visible range (515–760 nm) with the highest quantum yield of ∼12% at room temperature is described. Here, both the core size and shell thickness were controlled to achieve color-tunable emission. This is the first report related to wet chemical synthesis of type-II Cu2S/CdS core/shell NCs with color-tunable emission to the best of our knowledge. The data from absorption spectra, PL spectra, XPS, XRD, and TEM provided direct proof of the formation of CdS shell. On the basis of the synthesis of Cu2S/CdS type-II NCs, CdS/Cu2S type-II NCs also showed a series of PL with different emissions. After ZnS shell growth on the type-II Cu2S/CdS core/shell NCs, emission of the Cu2S/CdS/ZnS NCs showed a blue-shift. The PL decay curve of the Cu2S/CdS NCs had a dual exponential characteristic with lifetimes of 150–350 ns and more than 1400 ns, respectively. The longer lifetime (more than 1400 ns) which might attribute to electron–hole recombination of the excitons in Cu2S/CdS type-II NCs occupied a large amount in the samples PL emission. The numerical value was much longer than the lifetime of CdS, which was inosculated with previous PL decay investigations of type-II structures.
