    , Accepted 3rd July 2019First published on 5th July 2019AbstractQuasi-metallic NixMoO3 nanodots with an enhanced localized surface plasmon resonance in the visible and NIR regions have been successfully fabricated. DFT calculations reveal the metallic nature of NixMoO3 nanodots. Thus, they exhibit an excellent photothermal conversion efficiency of 87.4%, and have a high water evaporation rate of 2.13 kg m−2 h−1.
Localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR), known as the resonant collective oscillation of valence electrons, is established when the frequency of an incident electromagnetic field matches the natural frequency of surface electrons.1–3 LSPR is usually accompanied by valuable physical and chemical effects such as near-field enhancement, heat generation and excitation of hot-electrons, which can show promising applications in photocatalysis, photothermal agents and surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS).4–7 Compared with traditional plasmonic materials such as noble metals, semiconducting materials with distinct electronic and optical properties may lead to significantly altered plasmon properties, and this can provide more opportunities to create new optical systems.8 However, semiconductor nanostructures generally have relatively small optical cross-sections in the ultraviolet (UV) or visible region, and only a limited energy fraction (ca. 44%) of the entire solar spectrum can be utilized. Recently, different strategies, including post-synthetic electrochemical modulation of the electron concentration, high temperature decomposition and a seeded-growth methodology have been explored to obtain mono-dispersed, controllably doped metal oxide with tunable LSPR properties.9,10 Meanwhile, the influence of composition and shape of doped semiconductors on the LSPR properties has also been investigated.11,12 Due to the intrinsic crystal structure of these materials, their ability to accommodate dopants is rather limited resulting in free charge carrier concentrations of less than 1021 cm−3, and this causes the plasmonic absorption band to locate within the mid-infrared region, which is not easily accessed in standard optical systems.13–17 Therefore, exploring an efficient route to obtain advantageous materials with plasmon resonance in the visible and near infrared (NIR) regions is important although it is challenging.18
In this work, we proposed a novel protocol to fabricate Ni intercalated transition metal oxides (TMOs) with the assistance of supercritical CO2, and a strong broadband adsorption spanning the UV-visible-NIR region can occur. More importantly, the band structure calculated based on density functional theory reveals that the insertion of Ni atoms can cause changes in MoO3 from a semiconductor with a certain band gap to a zero-band gap quasi-metallic NixMoO3 material. The enhanced LSPR effect endows NixMoO3 with superior performance for photothermal applications.
As illustrated in Fig. 1a, the single or few layered MoO3 nanosheets were exfoliated by sonication, and then nickel (Ni) ions were successfully intercalated into the interlayer of MoO3 nanosheets forming a novel NixMoO3 nanodot with the assistance of supercritical CO2 (SC CO2). The high diffusion and low viscosity nature of SC CO2 can help the intercalation process of the Ni ion into MoO3. Meanwhile, the increased acidity of the solution caused by the dissolution of CO2 in ethanol, combined with magnetic stirring, can efficiently decrease the size of nanosheets to obtain nanodots. The morphologies of MoO3 nanosheets (Fig. S1, ESI†) and the as-prepared NixMoO3 nanodots were characterized by TEM. Fig. 1b shows that the as-prepared sample is composed of quantum dots with a uniform distribution. The lateral size distribution was calculated and the average lateral size was 16.0 ± 1.0 nm, as shown in Fig. 1d. The NixMoO3 nanodots have no obvious lattice diffraction fringes, which presents a relatively low degree of crystallinity.

The compositions of the NixMoO3 nanodots were determined by Inductively Coupled Plasma-Atomic Emission Spectrometry (ICP-AES). After purification, the NixMoO3 nanodots were dissolved in nitric acid and diluted for elemental analysis. The results in Fig. S5 and Table S1 (ESI†) show that the atomic ratio of Mo:Ni is calculated to be 8:1, thus indicating that x equals to 0.125. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to confirm the stoichiometry of the samples as shown in Fig. 2a and b. For the MoO3 sample, the doublets at 236.3 and 233.1 eV are attributed to the 3d3/2 and 3d5/2 orbital electrons of Mo6+, respectively. In Ni0.125MoO3 samples, the intercalated Ni2+ ions result in the partial reduction of Mo oxidation states and the appearance of the Mo5+ oxidation state.6,19 The peaks appearing at 231.5 eV and 234.7 eV can be assigned to the Mo5+ oxidation peak. The Mo6+:Mo5+ ratio is calculated to be 77:23. Fig. 2b shows the Ni 2p XPS spectra of the sample, and the peaks at 855.9 eV and 873.5 eV can be attributed to the 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 orbitals of Ni, respectively. And the peaks at 860.7 eV and 880.3 eV can be referred to as satellite peaks.20 Then Raman spectra of MoO3 nanosheets and Ni0.125MoO3 nanodots were also recorded to investigate the influence of Ni2+ intercalation on the crystal structure and chemical bonding. For both MoO3 nanosheets and the as-prepared Ni0.125MoO3 nanodots, strong peaks appear at 667, 818, and 996 cm−1, all ascribed to the orthorhombic α-MoO3 structure. A weak and broad peak appears at around 950 cm−1, which can be assigned to the symmetric stretching modes of the terminal MoO bond in NiMoO4.21,22 And it can be assumed that this peak may be caused by the structural distortion of Ni0.125MoO3 upon Ni2+ intercalation. Besides, the formation of localized Mo5+ defect states and the Mo5+/Mo6+ charge transfer can lead to intense absorption in the visible and NIR regions,6 which can be reflected in the UV-vis-NIR absorption spectra of the Ni0.125MoO3/water solution as shown in Fig. 2d. Apparently, the absorption spectra show an intense single broad band spanning the visible and NIR regions, and the normalized absorption intensity over the characteristic length of the cell (A/L) at L = 808 nm was determined at different concentrations (Fig. S6, ESI†). A linear trend was observed for the dependence of A/L on the concentration in agreement with the Lambert–Beer law, indicating the good dispersity of Ni0.125MoO3 nanodots in aqueous solution.23

In order to investigate the influence of Ni atoms intercalated into the molybdenum trioxide layer at the early stage of the reaction, several potential configurations of Ni0.125MoO3 were fully optimized (Fig. 3a), and the band structure and electronic density of states of the lowest total energy configuration (Model 3) were studied. The results of geometric optimization reveal that Ni atoms inserted into the bulk MoO3 will cause lattice distortion which cannot be ignored (Table S2, ESI†), and in line with most of the trends reported,24,25 the lattice constant along the direction of the van der Waals stack increases obviously (14.2 Å to 15.2 Å). Nevertheless, it is worth noting that the inserted Ni atom can form a Ni–Mo metal bond with the adjacent Mo atom in addition to bonding with four adjacent O atoms, and the Ni–Mo metal bond can endow Ni0.125MoO3 with good electrical conductivity. Meanwhile, the formation of the metallic bond in the semiconductor can facilitate surface free electron transfer, and thus contribute to the LSPR effect.26–28

As shown in Fig. 3b, the band structure calculated with the spin polarization reveals that the intercalation of Ni atoms causes changes in MoO3 from a semiconductor with a certain band gap (Fig. S7, ESI†) to a zero-band gap quasi-metallic phase. The integrated densities of states shown in Fig. S8 (ESI†) indicate that the inserted Ni atoms transfer electrons to Mo atoms and O atoms, and the charge analysis of the inserted Ni atoms leads to a similar conclusion that the inserted Ni atoms lose 0.77 and 0.18 electrons in Mulliken and Hirshfeld charge analysis, respectively. The charge transfer of the inserted Ni atoms induces a shift in the Fermi energy level of Ni0.125MoO3 to the conduction band, and meanwhile, the d orbital of Ni atoms appears in the original band gap position of MoO3 (Fig. 3c and d). More importantly, compared with the band structure of the bulk MoO3 as shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†), there are several flat bands around the Fermi energy level as shown in Fig. 3b, which can facilitate the non-radiative transition of Ni0.125MoO3, hence the band structure of Ni0.125MoO3 reveals potential photothermal properties.
Our simulation results above have shown that there are several flat bands around the Fermi energy level, which can facilitate the non-radiative transition of Ni0.125MoO3.29 Further, different amounts of Ni0.125MoO3 nanodots were dispersed in aqueous solutions and exposed to an 808 nm NIR laser (power density: 1.0 W cm−2) for testing the photothermal conversion. The solution temperature was then monitored every 30 s using a thermocouple microprobe (Fig. 4a). And the dispersion temperature evidently increased in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. At a relatively low Ni0.125MoO3 concentration (500 μg mL−1), the solution temperature increases 49.3 °C after irradiation for 8 min. In contrast, the temperature of pure water only increases 1.9 °C, and the temperature of MoO3 nanosheets only increases 2.8 °C (Fig. S9, ESI†), indicating that the Ni0.125MoO3 nanodots can rapidly and efficiently convert NIR light into thermal energy. Besides, the temperature elevations were proportional to the simulated solar light intensities and the sample concentrations (Fig. 4b and Fig. S10 in the ESI†). And the external photothermal conversion efficiency η upon the solar irradiation can be calculated to be 87.4% for Ni0.125MoO3 nanodots (see the detailed calculation process in the ESI†). Compared with previous studies based on photothermal materials, it can be concluded that the external photothermal conversion efficiency of the Ni0.125MoO3 nanodots is significantly higher than those of most of the reported photothermal materials.23,29–32 Besides, the photothermal effect of the Ni0.125MoO3 nanodots did not deteriorate during temperature elevation after six cycles, highlighting their great potential as photothermal agents.

The outstanding insight into the thermal conversion efficiency of Ni0.125MoO3 nanodots offers unique opportunities for the development of solar-enabled water evaporation systems.33,34 Discoveries about butterfly wings show that their multilayer structures can be used as efficient solar energy collectors.35 In this work, a thin layer of Ni0.125MoO3 nanodots was doped on a natural butterfly wing to form a novel light collector–photothermal conversion material system. A comparison of IR photographs in Fig. S12 (ESI†) clearly indicated its highly improved solar to thermal conversion efficiency. Subsequently, this material system was used to float on water and acted as a localized photothermal heater. To simulate the practical conditions, mild irradiation (0.3 kW m−2) was employed. In sharp contrast to Fig. 4e and f, the surface temperature increased to 81.6 °C upon identical irradiation. And the solar vapor generation was then evaluated by monitoring the weight loss of water. An evaporation rate of 2.13 kg m−2 h−1 was measured from the collector–photothermal conversion material system, which is 1.67-fold higher than that of the natural butterfly wing (Fig. 4g). Moreover, the durability of the light collector–photothermal conversion device was investigated for 4 irradiation cycles (Fig. 4h), showing reliable photothermal stability of this system.
In summary, for the first time, quasi-metallic Ni0.125MoO3 nanodots have been successfully fabricated from semiconductive MoO3via a SC CO2-assisted intercalation route. DFT calculations indicate that the inserted Ni atom can form a Ni–Mo metal bond with the adjacent Mo atom in addition to bonding with four adjacent O atoms, and the Ni–Mo metal bond can endow Ni0.125MoO3 with good electrical conductivity. Moreover, compared with the band structure of the bulk MoO3, there are several flat bands around the Fermi energy level which can facilitate the non-radiative transition of Ni0.125MoO3. Our experimental results demonstrate that the Ni0.125MoO3 nanodots exhibit an excellent photothermal conversion efficiency of 87.4%, which endows the Ni0.125MoO3 nanodots with an evaporation rate as high as 2.13 kg m−2 h−1 for water evaporation. Therefore this study opens up a new opportunity to convert well-developed metal oxides to high-performance plasmonic materials via facile metal ion intercalation and it can be anticipated that this strategy can be extended to fabricate more advanced functional materials.
