    , Accepted 19th April 2018First published on 19th April 2018AbstractAqueous solution-processed methods offer several advantages such as simplicity, low-cost, environmental friendliness, and easy scale up. Herein, we present an ultrafast and convenient aqueous route to prepare off-stoichiometric Cu–In–S quantum dots (QDs) including CuInS2, a mixture of In2S3 and CuInS2 (In2S3/CIS), and Mn-doped In2S3/CIS (Mn:Cu–In–S), obtained by simply adjusting the feed ratio of Cu and In precursors in an identical procedure. Such off-stoichiometric QDs were then exploited as photon-harvesters in quantum dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs), which showed superior photovoltaic performance that is dependent on the [Cu]/[In] feed ratio. The QDSSCs sensitized with In2S3/CIS QDs exhibited a cell efficiency as high as 7.53%, a more promising performance than that of the device sensitized with CuInS2 QDs (1.0%). Such an improvement of the photovoltaic performance can be attributed to the favorable energy level alignment of the adjoining materials (the TiO2 semiconductor and In2S3/CIS QDs). Upon incorporation of Mn2+ into In2S3/CIS under identical conditions, the power conversion efficiency of the Mn:Cu–In–S-based QDSSC reached 8.0% due to a synergistic effect between the In2S3 QDs and Mn2+ dopant. Analyses of the Bader charge and projected density of states based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the coexistence of In2S3 and Mn2+ enhances the electronic coupling at the TiO2/QD interface, leading to a larger number of photoinduced electrons being injected into TiO2. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and intensity-modulated photocurrent/photovoltage spectroscopy measurements confirmed the slower charge recombination and prolonged electron lifetimes that result in the excellent efficiency of the QDSSC device sensitized with Mn:Cu–In–S QDs.
1. Introduction
Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) are prevalent in optoelectronic applications due to their unique size-dependent optical properties, multiple electron–hole pair generation, high extinction coefficients, stability against photobleaching, and high intrinsic dipole moments. In particular, the development of QDs as light-harvesting sensitizers in QD sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs) is an area of considerable current interest. In QDSSCs, semiconductor QDs are excited by absorbing incoming photons, thus generating electrons that are then injected into the TiO2 conduction band. Subsequently, the electrons go through an external circuit on arriving at the counter electrode. Finally, semiconductor QDs can be regenerated by the redox couple of an electrolyte solution.
Among various semiconductor materials, ternary copper-based chalcogenide QDs (e.g., CuInS2 and CuInSe2) have been considered one of the most promising light-absorbing materials in terms of their (1) direct band gap (1.0–1.5 eV), (2) high absorption coefficient (>105 M−1 cm−1), and (3) low toxicity as they do not contain heavy metals (Cd or Pb). Recently, several groups have employed copper-based chalcogenides as sensitizers in QDSSCs, affording photovoltaic energy conversion efficiencies of over 5% without the use of toxic heavy-metal compounds.1–10 For example, Pan et al. found that the use of CuInS2 QDs in QDSSCs resulted in efficiencies of 5.05%, with the best efficiency being 7.04% for CuInS2/ZnS core–shell QDs.5 Li et al. reported high efficiencies of 6.02% and 6.79% using CuInSe2 and CuInSe2/ZnS QDs, respectively, as sensitizers in QDSSCs.6 Recently, a record efficiency of up to 11.6% for Zn–Cu–In–Se QDSSCs was reported by Zhong's group.8 Nevertheless, these QDs are still prepared in organic solvents, followed by ligand-exchange with a bifunctional linker, which assists the self-assembly on the TiO2 surface with uniform coverage. The direct aqueous synthesis of CuInS2 QDs, already coated with the bifunctional linker, offers an easy and straightforward route for self-assembly on TiO2 films through carboxyl anchoring groups. This also allows the avoidance of subsequent complicated procedures and large volumes of chemical waste, leading to the easy, rapid, and highly reproducible preparation of QD sensitizers.
Interfacial charge transport between the QD sensitizer and metal oxide of QDSSCs is another important factor for the improvement of the solar cell performance. According to the previous literature, unmatched band alignments and high surface state densities are known to exist at TiO2/CuInS2 heterojunction interfaces, resulting in high recombination rates at the interface.11,12 Therefore, the introduction of a buffer layer has a profound impact on the junction properties by reducing the recombination losses between CuInS2 and TiO2.13,14 In2S3 is a well-known n-type semiconductor with a bandgap of 2.0–2.3 eV that possesses three different polymorphic forms, namely, α-phase, β-phase, and γ-phase In2S3.15 Among these phases, β-phase In2S3 consists of a body-centered tetragonal structure and is thermodynamically more stable at room temperature than the other phases. The In3+ atoms in In2S3 are found in all the octahedral sites and 2/3 of the tetrahedral sites, leaving 1/3 of the tetrahedral positions in the unit cell unoccupied.15 It has been reported that the In2S3 buffer layer determines the match between the energy levels of CuInS2 and TiO2, playing an important role in reducing the carrier recombination in TiO2/CuInS2, thus leading to a large improvement of the cell efficiency.14–19 For instance, in our previous work,14 we reported a TiO2/In2S3/CuInS2 cell with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 0.89%, showing a 53.4% improvement compared to the TiO2/CuInS2 cell without an In2S3 buffer layer (0.58% efficiency). Wang et al. reported well-connected In2S3 buffer layers deposited in situ on TiO2/CuInS2 films via chemical bath deposition (CBD), displaying a power conversion efficiency (η) of 1.62%.18 Xu et al. have published a successive ionic layer absorption and reaction (SILAR) method to deposit In2S3 layers at the TiO2/CuInS2 interface, reducing the defect states in CuInS2 and slowing down the interface electron recombination.
Herein, we present a simple, fast, and highly reproducible method to fabricate off-stoichiometric Cu–In–S QDs and their application as light-harvesting sensitizers in QDSSCs. The off-stoichiometric Cu–In–S QDs were prepared by direct aqueous synthesis in just 15 min under microwave irradiation. The obtained off-stoichiometric Cu–In–S QDs include (1) CuInS2, (2) a mixture of CuInS2 and In2S3 (In2S3/CIS), and (3) Mn2+-doped In2S3/CIS (Mn:Cu–In–S). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that In2S3/CIS QDs are fabricated by a microwave hydrothermal approach and that the presence of In2S3 is reported to benefit the band alignment at the TiO2/CuInS2 interface. As a result, the photovoltaic performance of a cell sensitized with In2S3/CIS QDs was significantly superior to that of a pristine CuInS2-based cell. Furthermore, QDSSCs sensitized with Mn:Cu–In–S QDs achieved a maximum power conversion efficiency of 8.0% under AM 1.5G simulated solar irradiation (100 mW cm−2). Moreover, density functional theory calculations have been carried out to gain insight into the role of the coexisting In2S3 and Mn2+ dopant in the QDs by analyzing their electronic properties.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Materials
Copper(II) chloride dihydrate (CuCl2·2H2O, 99.99%), sodium citrate (98%), dithiothreitol (DTT, 99%), and indium(III) nitrate hydrate (In(NO3)3, 99.9%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Milwaukee, WI, USA). Zinc acetate (Zn(OAc)2, 99%) was purchased from J. T. Baker Scientific (Phillipsburg, USA). Copper(II) nitrate hemipentahydrate (Cu(NO3)2·2.5H2O, 98%) and thioglycolic acid (TGA, 97%) were purchased from Alfa-Aesar (Ward Hill, MA, USA). L-Cysteine (99%), indium(III) chloride (InCl3, 99.99%), potassium chloride (KCl, 99%), and sodium sulfide nonahydrate (Na2S, 98%) were purchased from Acros Organics (Geel, Belgium). All reagents were of analytical grade and used as received without further purification. Ultrapure water (≥18 MΩ, Milli-Q, Millipore) was used throughout this work.
2.2 Synthesis of samples QD1–QD6
To obtain sample QD1, CuCl2 (1.25 × 10−2 mmol), InCl3 (1.25 × 10−2 mmol), and L-cysteine (8.8 × 10−2 mmol) were mixed with 20 mL of distilled water in a 30 mL exclusive vitreous vessel, and then the pH of the solution was adjusted to ∼9.0 by adding NaOH. A fresh Na2S aqueous solution (0.3 mL, 160 mM) was then added to the resulting mixture. The mixed solution was subsequently irradiated with microwaves in a single-mode microwave reactor (Anton Paar Monowave 300) at 180 °C for 15 min. The solution was then passed through a microporous cellulose membrane (0.22 μm). Finally, the resultant QDs were precipitated with isopropanol and collected by centrifugation at 6000 rpm for 15 min.
Samples QD2–QD5 were obtained by varying the Cu/In feed molar ratio (1:2, 1:3, 1:4, and 1:5, respectively). Sample QD6 was synthesized at a Cu/In/Mn feed ratio of 1:4:0.1 while keeping the other experimental parameters constant. A brief summary of the molar equivalents of different precursors used in the reaction is given in Table S1.†
2.3 Device fabrication
Glass substrates coated with fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) were cleaned using soapy water, distilled water, and ethanol. TiO2 scattering paste was prepared by mixing 30 wt% TiO2 sol (WER2-O paste, Dyesol) and 70 wt% TiO2 sol (18NR-T, Dyesol). TiO2 mesoporous films were prepared as described in our previous paper.14,20 Briefly, commercial TiO2 sol (18NR-T, Dyesol) and TiO2 scattering paste were used to prepare transparent and scattering TiO2 films on FTO substrates by a screen-printing method. The resulting films were then sintered at 500 °C for 30 min. For QD sensitization, the TiO2 mesoporous films were further soaked in a QD aqueous solution (2 mg mL−1) containing 4 M TGA for 24 h. The obtained films were then dipped in two solutions for 1 min in the following order: a 0.1 M Zn(CH3COO)2 methanol solution and a 0.1 M Na2S methanol/distilled water (v/v = 7:3). Following each immersion, the samples were rinsed with methanol and dried with argon, respectively. The above procedure represents one SILAR deposition cycle, which was repeated three times to apply a ZnS layer on the QD-sensitized films to obtain the photoelectrodes.
Finally, the photoelectrodes and counter electrodes were assembled using a thin thermoplastic frame (Surlyn 1702, DuPont). The cell was then filled with a redox electrolyte, composed of 1.8 M Na2S, 2.0 M S, and 0.2 M KCl in methanol/distilled water (v/v = 3:7), by capillary force. The counter electrodes were prepared according to a previous report.21 In brief, the FTO substrates were spin-coated with a Cu(NO3)2 methanol solution and a Na2S aqueous solution, followed by thermal annealing at 300 °C for 5 min, as previously described.21
2.4 Characterization
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained on an FEI Tecnai G2 F20 microscope with a field emission gun operating at 200 kV. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were obtained with a field emission scanning electron microscope (JSM 6500F). Elemental composition was determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES, Horiba model JY2000-2). Absorption and photoluminescence (PL) emission spectra were measured using a JASCO V-630 spectrophotometer and a Fluorolog-3 (HORIBA Jobin Yvon, Japan) fluorescence spectrometer, respectively. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) measurements were performed on a Tecnai G2 F20 microscope operating at 200 kV. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was carried out using a Bruker D8 Discover diffractometer. Electron spin resonance (EPR) was carried out using a Bruker Elexsys E-580 spectrometer.
Current density–voltage (J–V) measurements were conducted using a Keithley 2400 source meter with an AM 1.5 solar simulator (Oriel, model: 92250A, 150 W). Solar cells were masked using a metal aperture of 0.16 cm2, which defined the active area. The incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) was obtained using a 150 W Xe light source, a Keithley model 2400 unit, and a monochromator (Oriel CornerstoneTM 130). The impedance measurements were performed in the dark with a Zahner-Ennium electrochemical workstation (ZAHNER-Elektrik GmbH & Co. KG, Germany). Intensity-modulated photovoltage and photocurrent spectra (IMVS and IMPS) were recorded on a Zennium electrochemical workstation as a function of the light intensity (LED, λ = 457 nm) using Controlled Intensity Modulated Photo Spectroscopy (CIMPS).
2.5 Computational methods
In order to find the optimum adsorption configurations, including those of a mixture of In2S3 and CuInS2, TiO2/QD systems, and Mn-doped TiO2/QD systems, the calculations were performed using the density functional theory (DFT) framework in a plane-wave basis implemented using the Vienna Ab initio simulation package (VASP 5.4).22,23 The exchange-correlation energies were calculated within the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) using the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof24 functional for solids (PBEsol). The plane wave cutoff energy was set to 400 eV, and 10 × 10 × 5, 10 × 10 × 4, and 10 × 10 × 4 k-point meshes with the Monkhorst–Pack scheme were used for the bulk CuInS2, In2S3, and anatase TiO2 calculations, respectively. Previous studies have demonstrated that the TiO2 anatase phase dominates over the rutile phase in terms of electron transport, short-circuit photocurrent, and photocatalytic activity.25,26 Moreover, a number of studies have reported that the first crystalline phase formed during TiO2 synthesis is that of anatase.27,28 To optimize the bulk lattice parameters, the threshold of SCF convergence was set to 10−4 eV and 10−2 eV Å−1 for the total energy and force on each atom, respectively. The calculated lattice parameters of CuInS2, In2S3, and anatase TiO2 (a = b = 3.80 Å and c = 9.54 Å) were in good agreement with the experimental values (a = b = 3.78 Å and c = 9.51 Å).
Based on the corresponding XRD patterns and the surface energy benchmark calculations, we selected the CuInS2 (112), In2S3 (311), and In2S3 (400) surfaces to study the interfacial geometries of In2S3/CuInS2 and TiO2/QDs. The TiO2 anatase (110) surface was modeled by two molecular layers containing 32 Ti and 64 O atoms, and we also investigated the adsorption and electronic properties of TiO2/QD systems. A vacuum space of 15 Å was used to avoid interactions between adjacent slabs in the z-direction. Here, we compared the adsorption energy (Eads) of each In2S3/CuInS2 and TiO2/QD system and found the most favorable interfacial geometries; a more negative adsorption energy indicated stronger adsorption. On the other hand, the electron transfer was evaluated by a Bader charge analysis.29–31 The electronic coupling of two facets was estimated using the projected density of states and the variations in the Bader charge (ΔQ). The Eads and ΔQ of each In2S3/CuInS2 and TiO2/QD system were calculated as follows:Eads = Etotal − EA − EBΔQ = QA/B − (QA + QB)where Etotal is the total energy of the B surface adsorbed on the A surface, and EA and EB are the total energy of the isolated In2S3, CuInS2, and TiO2 surfaces. QA/B represents the total charge of In2S3 and TiO2 on the In2S3/CuInS2 or TiO2/QD systems, and QA and QB are the charges on the isolated In2S3, CuInS2, and TiO2 surfaces. A negative value of ΔQ indicates more negatively charged QD facets.
3. Results and discussion
Compared to convective heating, microwave-assisted heating has gained increasing interest for the synthesis of nanoparticles due to its fast temperature elevation and rapid volumetric heating, resulting in homogeneous heating, higher reaction rates, and enhanced reaction selectivity.32 Herein, we demonstrate a simple and rapid microwave-assisted aqueous synthesis of off-stoichiometric Cu–In–S QDs using copper chloride and indium chloride as the precursors at different molar ratios, while sodium sulfide was used as the sulfur precursor. L-Cysteine, bearing three functional groups (NH2, SH, and COOH), acts as a partial sulfur source and capping ligand. A schematic illustration of the procedure used to synthesize off-stoichiometric Cu–In–S QDs is presented in Scheme 1. The obtained off-stoichiometric Cu–In–S QDs include CuInS2, In2S3/CIS, and Mn:Cu–In–S.

3.1 Synthesis and characterization of materials

Table 1 summarizes the experimental conditions for the synthesis of off-stoichiometric Cu–In–S QDs prepared at varying Cu/In feed molar ratios. The Cu/In ratios of the obtained samples estimated by ICP were consistent with the Cu/In mole ratios in the reaction mixtures (Table 1). The crystal structure of the different samples was analyzed through their XRD patterns, as shown in Fig. 1. At [Cu]/[In] molar ratios below 1:3 (samples QD1–QD3), 2θ peaks at 28.0°, 46.5°, and 55.2° were observed, corresponding to the chalcopyrite CuInS2 phase (JCPDS card no. 75-0106). Upon reducing the [Cu]/[In] molar ratio to 1:4 and 1:5, the corresponding XRD patterns of samples QD4 and QD5 revealed additional diffraction peaks at 27.5°, 33.4°, 38.5°, and 54.0°, which were attributed to the (311), (400), (421), and (610) planes of cubic β-In2S3 (JCPDS 32-0456), respectively. The results indicate that the crystal phase of samples QD4 and QD5 is a mixed phase composed of chalcopyrite CuInS2 and cubic β-In2S3. Samples QD1–QD3 were classified as CuInS2 QDs, and samples QD4 and QD5 were classified as In2S3/CIS QDs. As displayed in Table S1,† the molar ratios of [S]/[In] used for samples QD1–QD5 are 3.84, 1.92, 1.28, 0.96, and 0.768, in sequence. It is interesting to note that samples QD4 and QD5 were prepared with insufficient S supply as compared with the In precursor. To investigate if the formation of In2S3/CIS will be affected by the concentration of the S precursor, we choose samples QD4 and QD5 as an example to assess the effect of different [S]/[In] ratios. In this control experiment, all experimental conditions are identical to those of the synthesis of samples QD4 and QD5 except that [S]/[In] ratios are 1.28 and 1.92 (denoted as samples QD4-1 and QD4-2, and QD5-1, and QD5-2, respectively). Table S2† summarizes the experimental conditions employed for the control experiment. The XRD data of samples QD4-1, QD4-2, and QD5-2 in Fig. S1† indicate the presence of only the chalcopyrite CuInS2 phase. Moreover, another control experiment was conducted to reduce the [S]/[In] ratios of sample QD3 to 0.768 and 0.96 (denoted as samples QD3-1 and QD3-2, respectively). The XRD study (Fig. S1†) reveals a mixed phase of chalcopyrite CuInS2 and cubic β-In2S3. The results suggest that the excess In precursor and insufficient S supply play a critical role in the preparation of In2S3/CIS. Fig. S2 and S3† show the TEM and high-resolution TEM images of samples QD1–QD5. The high-resolution TEM images of samples QD1–QD3 show an interplanar distance of 0.319 nm that matches well with the (112) lattice spacing of CuInS2, as displayed in Fig. S2b, d and f.† In the high-resolution TEM images of samples QD4 and QD5 (Fig. S3b and d†), the clear lattice fringes reveal the coexistence of CuInS2 and In2S3, in which the lattice fringe of 0.319 nm matches that of the (112) crystal plane of CuInS2, while the 0.182 nm and 0.164 nm lattice fringes correspond to the (531) and (533) crystal planes of In2S3.

Fig. 2 shows the absorption and emission spectra of samples QD1–QD5 with different Cu/In ratios. All the samples present a similar peak profile with broad absorption spectra tailing in the long wavelength range (Fig. 2a). It can also be noted that all the absorption profiles exhibit poorly resolved excitonic peaks, which is a feature of ternary and quaternary I–III–VI QDs. The optical bandgap of samples QD1–QD5 was determined from the corresponding absorbance spectra (Fig. 2a) by extrapolation of the linear region of (αhν)2 plots versus photon energy (Fig. S4, ESI†). Here, α and hν represent the corresponding absorption and the photon energy, respectively. For samples QD1–QD5, the calculated bandgap energies were estimated to be 1.34, 1.40, 1.44, 1.46, and 1.47 eV, respectively. At a [Cu]/[In] ratio of 1:1, the PL spectrum of sample QD1 exhibits a band-edge emission at ∼620 nm and a very weak deep trap emission in the 750–850 nm region (Fig. 2b). The trap-state emission33–35 may be correlated to incomplete surface passivation or to the presence of intrinsic defects such as vacancies and interstitial atoms. At lower [Cu]/[In] precursor ratios, the PL spectra of samples QD2–QD5 become broad and systematically shifted to longer wavelengths. Such broad emission may be attributed to donor–acceptor pair recombination, which is an optical feature of Cu-deficient CuInS2 QDs.36–39 In a donor–acceptor pair emission process, carrier transitions may occur from a donor state to the valence band, from the conduction band to an acceptor state, and from a donor state to an acceptor state, leading to broad emission bands. Previous studies have pointed out that donor–acceptor states created by defects and vacancies in chalcopyrite I–III–VI materials40–44 involve in general group VI vacancies (VIvac), interstitial group I atoms (Iint), and group III atoms substituted at group I positions (IIIsub) acting as donors; and group I vacancies (Ivac), group III vacancies (IIIvac), and group I atoms substituted at group III positions (Isub) acting as acceptors. The slight red-shift of the emission spectra may be ascribed to a reduction of the quantum confinement with the increasing concentration of the In precursor. Under In-rich conditions, rapid particle nucleation and growth results in larger particles emitting at longer wavelengths.

The formation mechanism of off-stoichiometric Cu–In–S QDs may be correlated with the different nucleation kinetics of different cationic precursors during the preparation of Cu–In–S QDs. The general mechanism for the formation of nanocrystals in solution involves two consecutive stages: (i) a nucleation event, followed by (ii) nuclei growth stages. To successfully prepare homogeneous products, the decomposition rate of the precursors must be similar at the nucleation stage; otherwise, unfavorable crystalline phase separation or separate nucleation of the various binary products occurs. Although the utilization of microwave-radiation heating can initiate the instantaneous nucleation of multiple components and afford shorter crystallization times, the balanced combination of multiple cations and stabilizers should also be considered in order to obtain simultaneous nucleation during the preparation of ternary QDs. For example, there is a significant Ksp difference between In2S3 and Cu2S,45 which may lead to different nucleation of fine binary sulfides instead of the formation of homogeneous nuclei (CuInS2). To decrease the reactivity of Cu–S complexes, L-cysteine, an amino acid bearing a thiol group, was utilized as a stabilizer and sulfur source in the reaction. According to Pearson's hard–soft acid/base (HSAB) principle,46 Cu+ is a soft acid with high affinity to bind Lewis soft bases (L-cysteine), resulting in the formation of stable molecular complexes, compared to In3+ which is a hard acid. During the heating process, In–S and Cu–S molecular complexes simultaneously decompose to their corresponding reactive molecular species, named “monomers”, which successively accumulate to above critical supersaturation levels (nucleation concentration) in the solution, followed by a burst nucleation event giving rise to the formation of CuInS2 nuclei. After the nucleation event, subsequent growth stages take place on the existing nuclei by depletion of the monomer solution. On the basis of the above results, samples QD1–QD3 are obtained by the successful balance of the reactivities of the In–S and Cu–S molecular complexes, affording CuInS2 nuclei at [Cu]/[In] molar ratios from 1:1 to 1:3. However, at initial [Cu]/[In] ratios higher than 1:4 (samples QD4 and QD5), this delicate balance of nucleation rates is disrupted, resulting in the formation of mixed phases with coexisting CuInS2 and β-In2S3 nuclei due to an excess of In3+ ions and limiting S2− reagents. As a result, In2S3/CIS QDs are obtained from the reaction. Specifically, the excess In3+ reactants in the reaction mixture may allow more In3+ ions to preferentially associate with the limiting S2− reagents in the initial reaction stage. Dissolved Cu+ was then coordinated with the S atoms that were exposed on the surface of In2S3 nuclei, subsequently leading to the formation of CuInS2. The remaining In2S3 nuclei were not completely converted to CuInS2 due to the limiting Cu+ concentration, and consequently a mixed phase with coexisting CuInS2 and In2S3 occurred.
3.2 Photovoltaic performance
To explore their potential application in photovoltaic devices, CuInS2 and In2S3/CIS QDs were deposited on FTO substrates with Cu2S as the counter electrode for QDSSCs.

Using chalcopyrite CuInS2 QDs as sensitizers in QDSSCs, cell QD1 achieved a short circuit current density (JSC) of 3.51 mA cm−2, an open circuit voltage (VOC) of 500 mV, and a fill factor (FF) of 57.0%, resulting in 1.0% efficiency. The poor efficiency of cell QD1 may be attributed to enhanced carrier recombination facilitated by the high concentration of defect clusters or intrinsic defects in the crystal lattice of sample QD1. In contrast, with a smaller molar fraction of Cu/In, cell QD3 exhibited the best conversion efficiency among cells QD1–QD3 (6.52%), attributed to its superior JSC and VOC values. It has been reported that In-rich CuInS2 helps eliminate intrinsic defects arising from Cu deficiencies inside the crystal structure.36,47–49 The reduction of these intrinsic defects, which usually act as charge recombination centers, could lead to more photoinduced electrons being injected into TiO2, therefore improving the photovoltaic performance of the cell.49
In the case of In2S3/CIS QDs as sensitizers in QDSSCs, the best cell efficiency of 7.53% (JSC = 25.2 mA cm−2, VOC = 630 mV, FF = 47.3%) was obtained with cell QD4. With a smaller [Cu]/[In] molar ratio, the efficiency of cell QD5 decreased to 6.95%, lower than that of cell QD4. This could be the consequence of an excessive number of In2S3 QDs occupying the inner pores of the TiO2 mesoporous film, resulting in poor loading of CuInS2 QDs and thereby insufficient light-harvesting efficiency. However, both cells based on the coexistence of In2S3 and CuInS2 QDs exhibited a much higher JSC than cells QD1–QD3. A possible explanation for such a JSC improvement could be the insertion of In2S3 between CuInS2 and TiO2, tailoring a more favorable energy level at the heterojunction interface after quasi-Fermi level alignment. Scheme 2a illustrates the possible energy levels of TiO2 and In2S3/CIS QDs, resulting in a cascade of conduction band edges in the order CuInS2 > In2S3 > TiO2.50,51 Such an energy cascade is expected to result in a stronger driving force for the injection of photoexcited carriers from CuInS2 QD into TiO2, contributing to the improvement of the JSC values. Cell QD4 was thus chosen to carry out a detailed microscopic characterization of the TiO2 film sensitized with In2S3/CIS QDs. Another possibility is that the additional In2S3 material facilitates good electronic coupling between the conduction band of the QDs and the TiO2 interface, as will be discussed in the theoretical analysis. The electronic coupling strength is related to the wavefunction overlap between two materials. Strong electronic coupling between In2S3/CIS QDs and TiO2 will efficiently mediate the electron transfer, leading to increased JSC values.

It can be seen that the FF of cells QD2–QD5 is relatively low compared to that of cell QD1. The FF value is usually related to the series and shunt resistances of the solar cell. The reducing FF may be ascribed to the partial clogging of TiO2 mesoporous channels by small amounts of QDs with a larger size, resulting in hindrance of electrolyte infiltration and poor contact between electrolyte and oxidized QDs.
The high-resolution TEM image in Fig. 4a shows the coexistence of chalcopyrite CuInS2 and cubic β-In2S3 anchored on the TiO2 nanoparticles with well-defined lattice fringes. High-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) scanning transmission-electron microscopy (STEM) imaging and EDS elemental mapping were also carried out to characterize the TiO2 film sensitized with In2S3/CIS QDs (Fig. 4b and c). As shown in Fig. 4c, Cu, In, S, Ti, and O appear in the same location, suggesting that In2S3/CIS QDs are uniformly distributed over the TiO2 nanoparticles.

It has been previously reported that the enhanced performance of QDSSCs using Mn2+ as the dopant is the result of new intermediate electronic states (4T1 and 6A1 states) hindering the exciton recombination and leading to higher JSC values.52–56 Therefore, to maximize the performance of our devices, we also evaluated the effect of Mn2+ doping on the photovoltaic performance of QDSSCs using Mn:Cu–In–S QDs as sensitizers. The synthetic procedure for Mn:Cu–In–S QDs (sample QD6) consisted of a Cu/In/Mn precursor ratio of 1:4:0.1, while the other reaction conditions were kept the same as those for sample QD4, as shown in Scheme 1c. The crystal structure of sample QD6 with well-resolved lattice fringes was investigated by high-resolution TEM (Fig. S6a, ESI†). The EDS spectrum of sample QD6 (Fig. S6b†) confirmed the presence of Cu, In, S, and Mn. The ICP-OES results confirmed the average mole ratio of Cu/In/Mn to be about 1:3.99:0.1. Fig. S6c† shows the UV-vis and photoluminescence spectra of sample QD6. In the XRD analysis (Fig. S6d†), no additional phases were observed but those of In2S3 and CuInS2, and no shifts in the peak position of the XRD pattern of sample QD6 were noticed compared to that of sample QD4 (Fig. 1). It may thus be inferred that a small quantity of the Mn dopant does not induce any additional strain on the In2S3 and CuInS2 phases in sample QD6. The EPR spectra also supported the presence of Mn in sample QD6 (Fig. S6e†). The results showed no EPR signals for sample QD4 and a single broad Lorentzian band for sample QD6, arising from the electron spin–spin interactions (1/2 → −1/2) of the isolated Mn ions inside the host material.57–59
As shown in Table 2, the as-fabricated cell QD6 exhibited the highest efficiency among all cells at 8.0% with a high JSC of 26.5 mA cm−2, VOC of 644 mV, and FF of 46.9%. By comparing the JSC of cells QD4 and QD6, the improvement in the photocurrent density can be attributed to a higher electron injection rate upon doping the In2S3/CIS host with Mn2+. As shown in Scheme 2b, new energy states including a 4T1 excited state and 6A1 ground state are generated in the bandgap of the In2S3/CIS host upon Mn2+ doping.60,61 When illuminated, the photoexcited carriers travel to the conduction band of TiO2 following two available pathways: one involves injection from the conduction band of the CuInS2 host, and the other one involves relaxation from the 4T1 excited state generated by the Mn2+ dopant. Therefore, faster injection rates and a larger number of photoexcited carriers can be achieved by incorporating Mn2+ into the In2S3/CIS host, thereby leading to improved JSC values. Alternatively, it is possible that the degree of electronic coupling between the QDs and TiO2 becomes stronger after incorporating the Mn2+ dopant into the In2S3/CIS host. The enhanced overlap of the wavefunctions favors the efficient electron injection from Mn-doped QDs to TiO2, as discussed in the theoretical section. Moreover, there is a 14 mV slight enhancement of the VOC of cell QD6 compared to that of cell QD4, possibly arising from the accumulation of more electrons transported from the photoexcited QDs into the TiO2 conduction band and resulting in the upward displacement of the quasi-Fermi level of TiO2.
The IPCE spectra of the QDSSCs sensitized with samples QD3, QD4, and QD6 are shown in Fig. 3b. They clearly reveal broad IPCE curves, covering almost the entire visible spectrum from 300 to 950 nm. The integral JSC values from the IPCE spectra follow the order of cell QD6 > cell QD4 > cell QD3, which is in good agreement with the trend of the measured values from J–V curves. The JSC values estimated from the IPCE spectra are lower than the measured values from the J–V curves. This could be due to the lower light intensities used in IPCE measurements, the effect of high chopping frequency on the IPCE spectrum, and the absence of bias light.62,63
3.3 Electrochemical activity
To investigate the charge-transfer kinetics at the surface of the electrode, cells QD3, QD4, and QD6 were selected for detailed analysis as they exhibit the best photovoltaic performances of all the cells sensitized with CuInS2, In2S3/CIS, and Mn:Cu–In–S QDs. Fig. 5a shows the Nyquist plots of cells QD3, QD4, and QD6 at an applied bias of −0.60 V and in the frequency range from 10−2 to 105 Hz, with an AC amplitude of 10 mV under dark conditions. The Nyquist plots display two semicircles, where the high-frequency semicircle reflects the charge-recombination resistance (RCT1) at the counter electrode/liquid electrolyte interface and the low-frequency semicircle corresponds to the charge-recombination resistance (RCT2) at the TiO2/QD/electrolyte interfaces. RS is related to the FTO substrate resistance. The RS, RCT1, and RCT2 values were obtained by fitting the EIS plots using the equivalent circuit (inset in Fig. 5a), as summarized in Table 3.

As shown in Table 3, RS exhibits no apparent changes among the tested solar cells as they all contain the same FTO substrate. The value of RCT1 for the three cells is very similar, consistent with the fact that all the devices were prepared using identical counter electrodes and liquid electrolytes. The RCT2 value of the QDSSCs descends in the order cell QD6 (920 Ω) > cell QD4 (848 Ω) > cell QD3 (625 Ω), consistent with the trend of the photovoltaic performance of the QDSSCs shown in Fig. 3. The RCT2 value of cell QD4 is higher than that of cell QD3 due to slower charge recombination. This could be attributed to the better energy level alignment between CuInS2 and TiO2 in the presence of In2S3, enhancing the rapid charge transport and delaying the charge recombination. Among those three cells, cell QD6 exhibits the highest RCT2 value, likely due to a synergistic effect between In2S3 and Mn2+ slowing down the charge recombination. The lifetime (τr) of the injected electrons in the oxide film was estimated using the maximum angular frequency (ωmax) in the Bode phase diagrams (Fig. 5b). The equation is τr = 1/ωmax = 1/2πfmax, where fmax is the maximum frequency of the lowest frequency peak. The electron lifetimes for cells QD3, QD4, and QD6 were calculated to be 163.3, 203.0, and 234.8 ms, respectively. The prolonged electron lifetime and slower charge recombination rate result in the high JSC and efficiency values observed for cell QD6. The increased lifetimes obtained for the charge carriers are consistent with previous reports in which Mn2+ dopants were employed in QDSSCs.53,55,56,64,65
The dynamics of charge transport and recombination in the cells was further evaluated using IMPS and IMVS, as shown in Fig. 5c and d, respectively. All the measurements were carried out using a diode laser (λ = 457 nm) at different light intensities (from 30 to 150 W) with modulation control. The electron transport times (τIMPS) and lifetimes (τIMVS) were evaluated from the expressions τIMPS = 1/2πfIMPS and τIMVS = 1/2π fIMVS, respectively, where fIMPS and fIMVS are the characteristic frequency minimum of the IMPS and IMVS imaginary components, respectively. Both the electron transport times and lifetimes of the obtained cells decreased with increasing light intensity, as illustrated in Fig. 5c and d. Additionally, it was found that cell QD6 presented the lowest charge transport time and longest electron lifetime among the three devices, providing faster charge collection at the photoanode due to the Mn (4T1 → 6A1) spin forbidden transition. This result is in agreement with the measured JSC differences and the EIS results presented above.
3.4 DFT calculations
To gain insight into the In2S3/CuInS2 and TiO2/QD systems, DFT calculations were performed to determine the interfacial geometries using CuInS2 (112), CuInS2 (220), In2S3 (311), In2S3 (400), In2S3 (440), and anatase TiO2 (110) facets. The most stable systems of In2S3/CuInS2 and TiO2/QDs are shown in Fig. 6a–e. The optimized structures of anatase TiO2 (110) surfaces with adsorbed QDs and Mn-doped QDs are given in the ESI (Fig. S7 and S9).† The calculated adsorption energies for the corresponding systems are reported in Table 4. We determined the adsorption energies of In2S3 (311) and In2S3 (400) facets on CuInS2 (112) to be −0.17 and −0.33 eV Å−2, respectively. The results indicate that In2S3 (311) and In2S3 (400) are firmly adsorbed on CuInS2 (112), suggesting that the mixed phase composed of chalcopyrite CuInS2 and In2S3 is a stable system. Additionally, the results in Table 5 show that the Eads of TiO2/In2S3 (−0.32 or −0.26 eV Å−2) is more negative than that of TiO2/CuInS2 (−0.19 eV Å−2), suggesting that the In2S3 surface in the mixed phases of CuInS2 and In2S3 (samples QD4 and QD5) is more favorably adsorbed on the TiO2 surface than the CuInS2 surface alone. Further, based on the calculated interfacial geometries, the lattice mismatch between the In2S3 and anatase TiO2 (101) surfaces is less than 5%. These results support the schematic for the formation of the TiO2/In2S3/CuInS2 complex system depicted in Scheme 2.

The changes in the Bader charge summarized in Tables 4 and 5 are related to the electron injection ability between the interfaces of either In2S3/CuInS2 or TiO2/QDs, respectively. As shown in Table 4, the negative values of ΔQ indicate that electrons preferentially transfer from CuInS2 (112) to In2S3 (311) or (400) in the In2S3/CuInS2 system. In the TiO2 and In2S3 system, it was also found that the value of ΔQ for TiO2/In2S3 (311) and TiO2/In2S3 (400) was −0.12 and −0.82e, respectively, as listed in Table 5. This indicates that electrons preferentially transfer from In2S3 to TiO2. When the TiO2/CuInS2 and TiO2/In2S3 systems were examined, all the different QD facets adsorbed on TiO2 (110) presented a negative ΔQ value, suggesting that the electron injection from the different QDs into TiO2 is favorable.
The Eads values of the interfacial geometries and the negative ΔQ value for both In2S3/CuInS2 and TiO2/In2S3 clearly support that CuInS2 QDs can be excited by adsorbing incoming photons to generate electrons, which are then transferred to the In2S3 QDs, suggesting the favorable step by step electron injection into the TiO2/In2S3/CuInS2 complex system. Such an energy cascade provides a strong driving force for the injection of photoexcited carriers from the CuInS2 QDs into TiO2, contributing to increasing the JSC value.

Fig. 7 shows the projected density of states (PDOS) of In2S3(311)/CuInS2(112), TiO2(110)/CuInS2(112), and TiO2(110)/In2S3(311). The detailed configurations and PDOS of all systems are shown in the ESI (Fig. S11–S13).† As observed in Fig. 7a, the conduction band of the In2S3(311)/CuInS2(112) system exhibits a significant overlap between the In2S3 and CuInS2 phases, indicating strong electronic coupling at the interface between In2S3 and CuInS2. In Fig. 7b and c, it can be observed that the energies of the conduction band (Ecb) of CuInS2 and In2S3 are higher than that of TiO2, indicating that the electrons in CuInS2 and In2S3 QDs are energetically favored for injection into the TiO2 surface, in agreement with the working principles of QDSSCs. Moreover, it is noteworthy that the QD-induced states couple with the TiO2 states across a wide energy range, as shown in Fig. 7c, implying a good overlap of the conduction band between In2S3 (311) and TiO2 and resulting in strong electronic coupling that facilitates the charge transfer at the interface. In contrast, the results in Fig. 7b illustrate the weak electronic coupling of the conduction band in the TiO2/CuInS2 (112) system owing to the poor overlap between TiO2 and CuInS2 (112). In other words, the combination of In2S3 and CuInS2 QDs effectively transfers photogenerated electrons into the conduction band of TiO2 compared to the case of CuInS2 QDs. In addition, it can be seen in Fig. S14† that the Ecb values follow the order of CuInS2 > In2S3 > TiO2, leading to the efficient transport of photogenerated electrons. The above results are in good agreement with the data obtained from the J–V curves; for example, cell QD4 displays a higher JSC of 25.2 mA cm−2 than cells QD1–QD3. To understand the influence of the Mn2+ dopant, we also investigated TiO2/QD systems doped with Mn2+ atoms via DFT calculations. In the Mn-doped CuInS2/In2S3 system, an In atom was substituted by a Mn2+ atom at the interface between the QDs and the TiO2 surface, as shown in Fig. 8. The PDOS of Mn:CuInS2 (112) in Fig. 8a illustrates that the valence band of TiO2 and CuInS2 (112) is close to the Fermi level of Mn:CuInS2 (112), which does not change significantly compared to that of TiO2/CuInS2 (112) in Fig. 7b. In contrast, the conduction band of CuInS2 (112) shifts to the Fermi level of Mn:CuInS2 (112) when the Mn2+ dopant was incorporated into the CuInS2 system. Moreover, we calculated the percentage of conduction band overlap according to the following equation:Conduction band overlap (%) = (Aoverlap/AQD) × 100where Aoverlap is the integrated area of the overlap of the conduction band between QDs and TiO2 and AQD is the integrated conduction band area of the QDs. The percentages of conduction band overlap are listed in Table S3.† The percentages of conduction band overlap in the CuInS2 (112) system changed from 36% to 65% after doping the Mn2+ atom. Such a larger overlap region between Mn:CuInS2 (112) and TiO2 indicates that the electrons can populate a wide range of energy states over the conduction band, leading to strong electronic coupling. The PDOS in Fig. 7c shows the presence of significant overlap of the conduction band between In2S3 (311) and TiO2. Furthermore, the PDOS of Mn:In2S3 (311) in Fig. 8b also illustrates the increasing overlap of the conduction band with the Mn2+ dopant. The percentages of conduction band overlap in the In2S3 (311) system changed from 65% to 78% after Mn2+ doping, resulting in stronger electronic coupling and facilitating the charge transfer at the interface. Other detailed PDOS of TiO2/QD systems are shown in the ESI (Fig. S8 and S10).†

The Fermi level (Ef) is set at 0 eV, as denoted by the vertical black dashed line. The black solid curve in (a) corresponds to the PDOS of In2S3, and the color-filled curve to the PDOS of CuInS2. The black solid curves in (b) and (c) correspond to the total DOS of TiO2 and the color-filled curves to the adsorbate-projected DOS of the coated QDs.

Table 5 also illustrates that the ΔQ of the Mn:CuInS2 (112) and Mn:In2S3 (400) systems becomes more negative upon Mn doping, from −1.26 to −1.29e and from −0.82 to −0.85e, respectively. The small difference in ΔQ suggests that the Mn2+ dopant in the TiO2/QD systems does not influence the ΔQ value significantly. However, the conduction band of CuInS2 (112) coupled to the TiO2 states becomes wider after Mn2+doping, resulting in strong electronic coupling that facilitates the electron transfer from CuInS2 into TiO2. The increased ΔQ and conduction band overlap improves the electronic coupling at the Mn-doped TiO2/QD heterojunction interface, enhancing the conversion efficiency of the QDSSCs. Table S3† lists the calculated adsorption energy, Bader charge variation, and percentage of conduction band overlap for the TiO2 (110) surface with different QDs and Mn-doped QDs, revealing a trend toward more negative ΔQ values and an increased overlap of the conduction band between QDs and TiO2 in the presence of Mn2+ dopants. This means that Mn2+ doping not only benefits the electron injection from the QDs into TiO2 but also results in stronger electronic coupling at the interfaces. In conclusion, the calculations here presented provide insight into the influence of Mn2+ atoms in the performance of QDSSCs.
4. Conclusions
Here, we report a facile one-pot synthesis of different off-stoichiometric Cu–In–S QDs (CuInS2, In2S3/CIS, and Mn:Cu–In–S) by manipulating the Cu/In feed ratio and a systematic investigation of the photovoltaic performance of QDSSCs based on the obtained QDs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first one-pot synthesis in the aqueous phase of In2S3/CIS QDs containing both In2S3 and CuInS2. The off-stoichiometric Cu–In–S QDSSCs exhibited obvious enhancements that are dependent on the [Cu]/[In] feed ratio. The In2S3/CIS-based QDSSCs exhibited a device efficiency of up to 7.53%, higher than that of the QDSSCs sensitized with only CuInS2. Upon Mn2+ doping, the fabricated Mn:Cu–In–S QDSSC achieved the highest efficiency of 8.0% (JSC = 26.5 mA cm−2, VOC = 644 mV, and FF = 46.9%) of all the constructed cells under standard AM 1.5 sunlight illumination. The superior photovoltaic properties were attributed to a synergistic effect of In2S3 and Mn2+, allowing the enhancement of the electron injection rates and prolonging the electron lifetimes. Moreover, theoretical analyses of the Bader charges and PDOS additionally supported the enhancement of the electronic coupling between QDs and TiO2 owing to the In2S3 phase and Mn2+ dopant, thus resulting in efficient charge generation and high PCE values.
The off-stoichiometric Cu–In–S QDSSCs presented here have not been fully optimized yet; however, the cell efficiency achieved here is already promising based on the merits of the direct aqueous synthesis of QDs, with great potential for the facile, eco-friendly, and low-cost fabrication of QDs with high synthetic reproducibility. It is believed that the PCE will be further enhanced by optimizing the device components, including (1) a new counter electrode (such as Ti mesh-supported mesoporous carbon) for high electrical conductivity and effective catalytic reduction of the electrolyte, which is beneficial for FF enhancement, (2) additional surface treatment (such as a SiO2 layer or metal oxyhydroxide coating) on the QD surface to suppress the charge recombination at the TiO2/QDs/electrolyte interfaces, and (3) novel electrolyte additives combined with redox couples to reduce the undesired charge recombination and thus improve the VOC.
