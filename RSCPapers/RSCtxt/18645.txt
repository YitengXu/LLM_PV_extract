1. Introduction
Inorganic semiconductor quantum dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSCs) have attracted much attention in the past few years since they have a possibility of breaking the Shockley-Queisser efficiency limit.1,2 CdS and CdSe quantum dots (QDs) are often used as the inorganic semiconductor co-sensitizers because of their advantages in light harvesting and electron injection,3 and much progress has been achieved based on TiO2 photoanodes. A high efficiency of 5.4% has been reported for the Mn–doped CdS/CdSe QDSC.4 By employing a modified polysulfide redox couple in an organic solvent, the performance of the CdS QDSC showed an efficiency of 3.2% with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.2 V.5 However, based on the widely used sulfide/polysulfide aqueous electrolyte, the Voc of CdS/CdSe QDSCs is typically lower than 600 mV.3,4,6,7 Alternatives to the traditional TiO2 photoanodes for QDSCs are other wide band gap oxide semiconductors such as ZnO,8 SnO2,9,10 and Nb2O5.11 Among these materials, ZnO based QDSCs are believed to have the greatest potential for achieving a higher Voc than TiO2 based QDSCs due to their higher carrier mobility12 and the higher conduction band minimum13 of ZnO. Additionally, the similar band gap and conduction band energies to TiO2,12 the flexibility in morphology control, and the possibility of low temperature applications14 also make ZnO a distinguished alternative to TiO2.
Up to now, the investigations on ZnO photoanode based QDSCs have mainly been focused on specially designed architectures, such as nanowire arrays,2,15,16 nanosheets,17 and flower-like structures.18 In a pioneering study, Yong et al. used a novel CdSe/CdS/ZnO nanowire array as the photoanode of QDSCs, and an efficiency as high as 4.15% was obtained with a Voc of 627 mV in 2010.2 Recently, a higher efficiency of 4.24% has been achieved with hierarchical tetrapod-like ZnO nanoparticles (NPs) as a photoanode.19 Based on ZnO/CdSe nanocable arrays synthesized by ion-exchange approach, Lee et al. reported an efficiency as high as 4.74% with a Voc of 650 mV.15 They subsequently improved the Voc to 836 mV with tri-layer ZnO/ZnSe/CdSe nanocable arrays as the photoanode, while the efficiency decreased to 4.54%.16 It is therefore believed that the ZnO based QDSCs can indeed provide excellent efficiencies and higher Voc values compared with TiO2 based QDSCs.
Nevertheless there are some key issues that limit the popularity of these specially designed architectures: (1) their preparation is time-consuming and needs elaborate chemical processes; and (2) their qualities, such as the length and width of the nanowires, cannot be readily controlled. On the other hand, it is known that synthesizing NPs is very simple and the prepared samples usually possess controllable qualities, such as particle size and crystallinity.20,21 It would constitute a significant development if (i) the ZnO NPs could be synthesized in large scale, (ii) the NPs could be made into a paste and assembled into films by the simple doctor blade or screen print technology like for TiO2 NPs, and (iii) most importantly, if ZnO NP based QDSCs possessed both high efficiency and excellent Voc. However, so far reports about QDSCs with mesoporous photoanodes based on ZnO NPs are quite rare. A CdSe-sensitized ZnO nanoporous electrode showed a monochromatic incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) as high as 70%.22 Zhu et al. used a modified electrodeposition method, occlusion electrosynthesis, to prepare ZnO porous films, and an efficiency of 2.26% was obtained for the CdS QDSC.23 Clearly the photovoltaic performance of ZnO NP porous film based QDSCs is unsatisfactory to date.
In the present study, we have synthesized ZnO NPs with a diameter of ca. 20 nm and high crystallinity by a green, rapid, and scalable continuous flow supercritical fluid process.20,21,24 The ZnO NPs were subsequently made into a paste and coated on F-doped SnO2 (FTO) conductive glass as the photoanode of CdS/CdSe QDSCs. By carefully regulating the deposition amount of CdS and CdSe QDs on the ZnO NP film, an optimum power conversion efficiency as high as 4.46% has been achieved, and the corresponding Voc of 683 mV is much higher than obtained for TiO2 NP photoanode based CdS/CdSe QDSCs.4,7
2. Experimental details
ZnO NP films preparation
ZnO NPs were synthesized in a continuous flow supercritical reactor at the Department of Chemistry, Aarhus University, using the procedures developed by Søndergaard et al.25 The starting material was a freshly made gel obtained from 10.4 g of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O and NaOH (stoichiometry ca. 1:2 for pH = 7) in 700 mL water. The flow rates of the gel and solvent (deionized water) pumps were ca. 10 mL min−1 each, and the temperature of the reactor was set at 210 °C, while the solvent heater was set at 360 °C. The pressure was 280 bar, and the whole synthesis process was achieved in less than one minute.
Imitating the procedure by which TiO2 based mesoporous photoanodes are typically fabricated,26 a viscous ZnO paste was made by mixing ZnO nanoparticles, ethyl cellulose (EC) and α-terpineol. ZnO NP films for the QDs deposition were prepared on FTO conductive glass (LOF, TEC-15) via the doctor blade technique and then dried in air. Anneal treatment at 450 °C for 10 min was employed to obtain mesoporous ZnO NP films. The film thickness was kept at 4 μm as measured by a surface profiler (KLA-Tencor).
Sensitization of CdS/CdSe QDs on ZnO photoanodes
Successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) and chemical bath deposition (CBD) techniques were employed to assemble CdS and CdSe QDs in sequence on the ZnO NP photoanodes.7,10,27,28 Briefly, for CdS QDs sensitization, the photoanode film was dipped into 0.02 M Cd(NO3)2 ethanol solution for 1 min, thoroughly rinsed with ethanol, then dipped into 0.02 M Na2S methanol–water (1:1, v/v) solution for another 1 min, rinsed with methanol. This was defined as one SILAR cycle. Subsequently, CdSe QDs were deposited on CdS sensitized films by the CBD method at 10 °C. The aqueous solution for CdSe deposition was a mixture of 26 mM CdSO4, 40 mM N(CH2COONa)3 (NTA) and 26 mM Na2SeSO3. The amount of QDs on the photoanode was controlled by SILAR cycles and CBD deposition time. Finally, the ZnO photoanodes were passivated with ZnS by twice dipping into 0.1 M Zn(CH3COO)2 and 0.1 M Na2S aqueous solution for 1 min alternately.
Characterization
The crystal structure of ZnO NP film was investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku, Ultima IV) using Cu Kα radiation. The morphologies of the films were obtained with scanning electron microscopy (SEM, FEI, XL30 S-FEG). The mesoporous ZnO NP films were scraped off the slide for the nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherm measurement (Micromeritics, ASAP-2020). The absorption spectra of the photoanodes were measured by a Shimadzu, UV-2550 spectrophotometer with an integral sphere.
An open sandwich-type cell was fabricated in air by clamping together the CdS/CdSe sensitized ZnO NP film, a drop of polysulfide electrolyte (1 M Na2S and 1 M S) and a Cu2S on brass counter electrode with two clips.7,28 For the photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) characterization, a solar light simulator (Oriel, 91192) was used to give an illumination of 100 mW cm−2 (AM 1.5) and a potentiostat (Princeton Applied Research, Model 263A) was used to record the J–V characteristics. The power of the simulated light was calibrated by a standard amorphous silicon photodiode (National Institute of Metrology, China) and the active area of the cell was 0.15 cm2. The IPCE of the QDSCs was measured in direct-current mode with a home-made setup under 0.3–0.9 mW cm−2 incident monochromic light illumination.29,30 Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were carried out using a ZAHNER IM6ex electrochemical work station over a frequency range of 0.1–105 Hz under 100 mW cm−2 (AM 1.5) illumination with the applied potential of Voc. The amplitude of the modulated signal was 10 mV.
3. Results and discussion
Microstructure

Fig. 1(a) shows the XRD pattern of a ZnO NP film annealed at 450 °C. The strong intensity of the diffraction peaks indicates a high crystallinity of the ZnO sample which is one of the advantages of the supercritical synthesis.20 All the diffraction peaks can be well indexed to the wurtzite structure of ZnO (JCPDS 36-1451). The crystallite size is 20 nm, estimated from the line broadening of the (101) diffraction peak according to the Debye-Scherrer formula. For sensitized solar cells, the microstructure of the photoanode films has a significant effect on the photovoltaic properties. Thus, nitrogen gas sorption data were measured and they are shown in Fig. 1(b). The nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherm of the ZnO NP film exhibits a type IV pattern with a hysteresis loop which is the signature of mesoporous materials.31 The BET specific surface area is 20 m2 g−1 which is comparable to that of the often used P25 TiO2 NP based films24 and the BJH desorption average pore size is 31 nm. In fact, the inset in Fig. 1(b) shows that the ZnO film has a wide pore size distribution from ca. 30 nm to ca. 90 nm besides a narrow distribution peak at 9 nm. Because the size of QDs (in the scale of several nanometers) is larger than that of dye molecules, this large pore size in the ZnO NP films is of great benefit to the QDs deposition and the electrolyte diffusion.

The surface morphologies of the naked ZnO NP film, the ZnO/CdS NP film and the ZnO/CdS/CdSe NP film were observed by SEM. As seen in Fig. 2(a), the ZnO NP film exhibits a clear porous structure, though mild aggregates form in the scale of approximately 100 nm (inset in Fig. 2(a)). The apparent size of the small particles as the basic building unit of the aggregate is ca. 20 nm which is similar to that of the as-synthesized ZnO sample25 (Fig. S1 in ESI†) and consistent with the XRD result. At the same time, the nanoparticles assembled into the aggregate are well defined, which ensures the essential specific surface area for sensitizer adsorption. After sensitizing with CdS and CdSe QDs (Fig. 2(b) and (c), respectively), the outline of the ZnO NPs assembled into the aggregates becomes increasingly fuzzier. HRTEM images (Fig. S2 in ESI†) show that the CdS QDs deposited by the SILAR method have a hexagonal structure with a crystal size of ∼3.5 nm. The thickness of the CdS shell coated on ZnO is about 3–5 nm. The crystal structure of CdSe prepared by the CBD method should be also hexagonal with a crystal size of ∼5 nm, as reported in our previous work.27Fig. 2(c) also shows that the deposition of QDs on the surface of ZnO NP film is uniform without serious aggregation. Although the pore size between two adjacent aggregates diminishes after sensitization, the majority of the pores are free, and this allows the electrolyte to penetrate through the whole photoanode.

Optical properties
The optical absorption spectra of the naked ZnO NP film, the ZnO/CdS NP film, and the ZnO/CdS/CdSe NP film are shown in Fig. 3. The naked ZnO NP film only absorbs incident light in the ultraviolet region at wavelengths shorter than 410 nm. The sensitization with CdS shifts the light absorption to the visible light region. Additional CdSe deposition extends the absorption range to the even higher wavelength of about 650 nm. This indicates that the CdS/CdSe combination can enhance the light absorption in almost the entire visible light region, and therefore this is often used as co-sensitizer in QDSCs. However, the light absorption range of the ZnO/CdS/CdSe NP film is still narrower than that of the specially designed architecture2,15 where the estimated absorption edges of CdS and CdSe nearly match the band gaps of the corresponding bulk materials (2.4 eV, 517 nm for CdS and 1.7 eV, 729 nm for CdSe). Then the band gaps of the CdS and CdSe QDs in our work are larger than those of bulk CdS and CdSe. Of course this relatively narrower absorption range will to a certain extent lead to a lower photogenerated current, which will be shown below. The insets in Fig. 3 are the photographs of these three NP films. The color of the NP films changes from light blue for the naked ZnO NP film, to light yellow after sensitization with CdS QDs, and then to deep red following sensitization with CdSe QDs.

Photovoltaic performance
The photovoltaic performances of the fabricated QDSCs were tested based on various ZnO/CdS/CdSe NP films with the same film thickness of 4 μm. The results are shown in Fig. S3 in ESI†. The CdS SILAR cycles (n) and CdSe CBD deposition time (m in hours) were regulated carefully to control the amount of QDs on the photoanode. The prepared ZnO NP photoanode is denoted as ZnO/nCdS/mCdSe. Fig. 4(a) shows the J–V curves for the QDSCs fabricated from the ZnO/5CdS NP film, the ZnO/16CdSe NP film, and the ZnO/5CdS/16CdSe NP film which provided the best performance. The corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. For the cell based on the ZnO/5CdS NP film, the short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) is 1.11 mA cm−2 and Voc is 203 mV. The additional deposition of CdSe QDs on the ZnO/5CdS NP film significantly increases Jsc and Voc to 10.48 mA cm−2 and 683 mV, respectively. The power conversion efficiency of the QDSC based on the ZnO/5CdS/16CdSe NP film reaches 4.46% which is close to the maximum efficiency of 4.92% of TiO2 based QDSCs in our previous work.7 The IPCE spectrum of a ZnO/5CdS/16CdSe based cell is plotted in Fig. 4(b), which is consistent with the absorption spectra (Fig. 3(c)) in the response spectrum. The Jsc calculated from the IPCE spectra is about 8.97mA cm−2.

The photovoltaic performance of the ZnO/16CdSe based QDSC is rather poor (inset in Fig. 4(a)) compared with that of the ZnO/5CdS/16CdSe based QDSC, which illustrates the essential role of the CdS mid-layer. Besides the fact that a larger CdSe amount can be deposited after the CdS sensitization as reported in the literature,19 we also found that the mid CdS is able to protect the chemically active ZnO from being destroyed during the CdSe deposition process. A main component of the aqueous solution for CdSe deposition is NTA which is frequently used as a chelating agent for metal ions.32,33 When immersed in the CdSe CBD solution containing NTA, ZnO is corroded because of the formation of a complex between NTA and Zn2+. In fact the thickness of the ZnO/16CdSe NP film shrank to less than 2 μm from the original 4 μm after CdSe sensitization. In contrast, the chemical environment of the CdS SILAR process in alcohol solution is relatively mild for ZnO.
It is noticed that the Voc of 683 mV and fill factor (FF) of 0.623 obtained here are both at a remarkably high level. EIS measurements were performed to investigate the charge transport and charge transfer processes in the ZnO/5CdS/16CdSe film based QDSCs.34–36 For comparison, TiO2 NP film based QDSCs were also fabricated with the same thickness, where the CdS and CdSe QDs were both sensitized under the optimized CBD conditions according to our previous work.7 The experimental data (Fig. 5) fit well with the transmission line model (Fig. S4 in ESI†) developed by Bisquert.37 While the total charge transport resistances (RT) in both the ZnO film and the TiO2 film are lower than 10 Ω, the total charge recombination resistance (RREC) at the ZnO/electrolyte interface is obviously larger than that at the TiO2/electrolyte interface. As we know, both Voc and FF of a QDSC are strongly influenced by the recombination loss of electrons at the photoanode/electrolyte interface. A relatively large RREC of the ZnO NP based QDSC, which indicates the greatly reduced power loss, is important for the excellent Voc and FF characteristics. Besides the smaller specific surface area of the ZnO NP film, we speculate that the improved ZnO/electrolyte interface structure formed in CdS/CdSe QDSCs contributes to the restrained recombination.

4. Conclusions
20 nm ZnO NPs with high crystallinity synthesized in a continuous flow supercritical reactor were used to fabricate the photoanode of a CdS/CdSe QDSC. The prepared ZnO film displays a well-defined mesoporous structure with a respectable specific surface area of 20 m2 g−1 and a large pore size of 31 nm. Photovoltaic tests indicate that the CdS mid-layer is vital to protect the chemically active ZnO from being eroded in the subsequent CdSe deposition environment. EIS results show that the recombination process is greatly restrained at the ZnO/electrolyte interface, which contributes to the excellent Voc and FF characteristics. By carefully regulating the CdS SILAR cycles and CdSe CBD deposition time, an efficiency as high as 4.46% was achieved with a 4 μm ZnO NP film, which is material-saving and cost-cutting. These results indicate promising prospects for ZnO NP based QDSCs.
