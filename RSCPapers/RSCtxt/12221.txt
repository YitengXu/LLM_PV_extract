, Accepted 11th June 2014First published on 11th June 2014AbstractWith the help of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), uniform polypyrrole (PPy) coatings were conveniently grown on both sides of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanosheet surfaces via a template-directed in situ polymerization. The rGO/PPy composites exhibited greatly enhanced thermoelectric performance with a power factor at room temperature of up to 3.01 μW m−1 K−2, which is 84 times greater than that of the pure PPy.
Thermoelectric materials can realize a direct conversion between thermal energy and electric energy, and thermoelectric devices possess obvious advantages such as no moving parts or bulk fluids, no working noise, no pollution and long service time.1–5 The energy conversion efficiency is often evaluated by the dimensionless figure-of-merit ZT = S2σT/κ, where S, σ, κ and T are the Seebeck coefficient, the electrical conductivity, the thermal conductivity and the absolute temperature, respectively.6,7 Traditional thermoelectric materials are based on inorganic semiconductors and metal alloys, including Bi2Te3, CoSb3, SiGe and BiSb.8–11 However, these materials have problems of toxicity, poor processability, low content in the earth and high cost. Therefore, the exploitation of new materials with a high thermoelectric performance still remains problematic.
Graphene has a unique two-dimensional (2D) nano-structure, consisting of a single atom sheet of conjugated sp2 carbon atoms, and it exhibits super mechanical properties, as well as electrical and thermal conductivities.12–15 Consequently, graphene has attracted considerable current interest in a lot of fields, such as in energy conversion/storage16,17 and for environmental pollution remediation.18 In order to facilitate these diverse applications, effective surface modification of the graphene nanosheets is always required. To date, covalent bonding19 and noncovalent wrapping by organic molecules20,21 or polymers22,23 via van der Waals forces or π–π interactions are the major methods developed for the surface functionalization of graphene. In the case of thermoelectric materials, the super electrical conductivity24a and high Seebeck coefficient24b of bare graphene are beneficial, whereas its extremely high thermal conductivity25 seriously limits its thermoelectric performance. As a consequence, bare graphene cannot be used directly as a thermoelectric material. Taking into account the low thermal conductivity of polymers (usually 0.11–0.44 W m−1 K−1),26 composites of graphene enwrapped with a polymer may provide an attractive strategy to achieve excellent thermoelectric properties.
Recently, conducting polymers, such as polyaniline (PANI), polypyrrole (PPy), and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT), have received increasing attention in versatile fields such as solar cells,27–29 electrochroism,30,31 and as thermoelectric materials.32–36 PPy is one of the most promising candidates for further development due to its easy synthesis as well as its excellent chemical and environmental stabilities.37 Unfortunately, research into thermoelectric composites, consisting of graphene enwrapped with PPy is very scarce. Here, the morphology of reduced graphene oxide (rGO)/PPy composites, prepared by template-directed in situ polymerization, was measured by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) techniques. Alternatively, the thermoelectric properties were studied as well. Importantly, the roles of dodecyl sodium sulfate (SDS) in the rGO dispersion, the polymerization of Py monomer, and its composite thermoelectric properties were emphasized.
Fig. 1 shows a schematic illustration of the preparation procedure of rGO/PPy composites. Typically, 12.5–50 mg rGO, prepared by a low-temperature exfoliation and a subsequent reduction at ambient temperature,38 was first dispersed in 20 mL SDS aqueous solution (10 mg mL−1) under ultra-sonication treatment for 60 min. Then, 25 mg of Py monomer was titrated dropwise into the rGO dispersion under ultra-sonication for 10 min. Then, the system was magnetically stirred for 20 min at room temperature, and then 2 mL of the oxidant of iron sulfate solution (187.5 mg mL−1) was added to initiate the polymerization of Py. Subsequently, the polymerization reaction lasted for 4 h at 0 °C. Finally, the precipitate was filtered, washed with deionized water, and then dried at 45 °C to obtain the rGO/PPy composite powder. For comparison, pure PPy was obtained under the same conditions in the absence of rGO.
 Fig. 1  Schematic illustration of the preparation procedure of rGO/PPy composites. 
Fig. 2A clearly compares the difference between the rGO aqueous dispersion with and without the presence of SDS. As shown in Fig. 2A(a), with the help of SDS, a homogeneous aqueous dispersion of rGO could be clearly observed. Neither a suspension of rGO nor precipitation occurred. Note that the SDS concentration was as low as 2.5 mg mL−1 (around the SDS critical micelle concentration (CMC)), and the rGO aqueous dispersion in the presence of SDS was quite stable for at least 1 month. In sharp contrast, as shown in Fig. 2A(b), bare rGO without SDS could not be dispersed well in water. Even after ultrasonication treatment for a long time, a distinct phase separation took place, where rGO aggregated in both the upper suspension and at the bottom precipitation of the vial. Therefore, it can be concluded that SDS greatly improved the dispersion of rGO in water.

The time intervals were (a) 0 s, (b), 10 s, (c) 20 s in the presence of SDS, and (a’) 0 min, (b’) 20 min, (c’) 20 h without SDS. 
On the other hand, the effect of SDS on the polymerization of Py monomers was investigated as well. As shown in Fig. 2B(a), a highly transparent and colourless solution appeared at the beginning of polymerization. Due to the contribution by SDS, the monomers of Py were well dissolved in water, possibly forming a micro-emulsion system. No obvious oil-like droplets could be observed at the vial bottom. After being magnetically stirred for only 10 s, the solution turned dark green (Fig. 2B(b)), suggesting that the polymerization reaction occurred, and the resultant polymer might have reached a medium average molecular weight. Subsequently, when the reaction time reached 20 s, a high molecular weight PPy was achieved, accompanied by a nearly black dispersion (Fig. 2B(c)). Contrary to the rapid reaction rate described above, the polymerization of Py without SDS was rather slow. In Fig. 2B(a’), some oil-like droplets of the Py monomers appeared at the vial bottom. After being magnetically stirred for 20 min, the system changed to only slightly yellow (Fig. 2B(b’)). Indeed, if no SDS was added, the polymerization time for reaching a nearly black dispersion was as long as 20 h (Fig. 2B(c’)), 60 times that of the above polymerization system with the presence of SDS. Thus, we concluded that SDS facilitated the dissolution of Py monomers in water and dramatically accelerated the polymerization reaction.
The morphology of the obtained rGO/PPy composites, prepared with the help of SDS, were directly observed by SEM and TEM measurements using a HITACHI S-4800 scanning electron microscope and a JEM-1011 transmission electron microscope. Fig. 3a–d displays the SEM images of the rGO/PPy composites and pure PPy. Distinctly, the composites revealed a continuous, uniform and planar structure with a curve-shaped morphology (Fig. 3a–c), indicating that PPy had been enwrapped homogeneously on both sides of the rGO nanosheets. Furthermore, with the increase of the content of the added Py monomers, the thickness of the wrapping layers (marked with the red arrows) increased distinctly. For example, when the mass ratio of rGO/Py was 2:1, the thickness of the wrapping structure was around 20 nm. An increase of the content of 1:1 led to an increased thickness of approximately 30 nm. When the ratio of rGO/Py increased further to 1:2, the wrapping layer became thicker to ∼40 nm. In sharp contrast, as shown in Fig. 3d, the pure PPy displayed a totally different morphology of scale-like spherical particles. Therefore, these SEM images provided the direct proof that PPy successfully grew on the rGO surfaces to create a uniform enwrapping structure, and more interestingly, the thickness could be conveniently controlled by tuning the ratio of rGO/Py mass ratios during the preparation process.

Alternatively, the TEM image of the rGO/PPy composite, shown in Fig. 3e, provided further proof of the uniform wrapping structure. The dark lines represent the boundaries and the wrinkles of the exfoliated rGO nanosheets, and the relatively light regions result from the PPy layer coated on rGO nanosheets. Obviously, the light regions were almost uniform in color contrast, suggesting that the wrapping layer of PPy were homogeneous in thickness. In addition, a few darker sections in the red rectangle regions resulted from the boundaries of rGO wrapped structures. Due to the warping of the rGO nanosheet (whose boundaries were represented by the core black line), the wrapping layers of the PPy (shell layers) dramatically increased in thickness, when being observed from the top view in the TEM measurement. This may account for the relatively darker parts around both sides of the core rGO nanosheet. Note that in the core–shell structures of the rGO/PPy composite, the PPy shell layer displayed a high homogeneity in color contrast, which further demonstrated the success of the wrapping structure by PPy.
On the basis of the above SEM and TEM results for the morphological observations, the wrapping morphology for the rGO/PPy composites was confirmed, in which exfoliated rGO nanosheets acted as the template in the core, and PPy macromolecules wrapped on the rGO nanosheets as the shell layers, as illustrated in Fig. 1. The SDS was adsorbed on the rGO surfaces via van der Waals forces, which thus increased the hydrophobicity of the rGO surfaces. Moreover, PPy molecules might have π–π interactions with rGO nanosheets, and van der Waals interactions with SDS. Furthermore, the thickness of the PPy wrapping layers could be conveniently tuned by changing the mass ratio of rGO/Py during the preparation process.
For both neat polymer and polymer composites, because their κ are low and almost independent of inorganic content, power factors of S2σ are usually employed to evaluate the thermoelectric property.37,39 Here, the σ of the film samples was measured by a Keithley 2000 Multimeter (Keithley Instruments Inc, USA) using a four-point configuration method. Moreover, in the measurements of S, the samples were firstly put onto two Peliter elements. Then, the sample temperatures (ΔT) and the thermoelectric voltage (Vtherm) were accurately measured by two thermocouples and through a Keithley 4200, respectively. Thus, S was calculated by the equation: S = Vtherm/ΔT. Fig. 4 presents the measured values of S and σ for the neat PPy, for the rGO/PPy composites and for the pure rGO. Distinctly, the rGO/PPy composites revealed a greatly enhanced S and σ as compared with either the neat PPy (with the presence of SDS) or the bare rGO. When compared with the S of the neat PPy (9.5 μV K−1) or the bare rGO (17.4 μV K−1), the rGO/PPy composites exhibited an obvious increase in S of 21.8, 25.2 or 26.9 μV K−1, which is about 2.3 to 2.8 times that of the PPy, and also larger than that of the bare rGO. In particular, the σ of the rGO/PPy composites increased dramatically to 29.4, 31.5 or 41.6 S cm−1, about 7.5 to 10.5 times that of the neat PPy (3.97 S cm−1). At a high rGO content (2:1), the composite also revealed a larger σ than the bare rGO (36.0 S cm−1). Moreover, we note that as for the composites with a core–shell enwrapping structure, both S and σ increased with the content of rGO or the mass ratio of rGO/Py. In other words, the composites displayed increases in S and σ with a decrease in the thickness of the wrapped shell layer. In addition, it is interesting that SDS had an obvious positive effect on σ. As shown in Fig. 4B, the σ of PPy with SDS (3.97 S cm−1) was ∼7.5 times that of the PPy without SDS (0.53 S cm−1), possibly due to the SDS doping of PPy.

As described above, the overall thermoelectric property of polymer materials is usually evaluated by the power factor (S2σ). Fig. 5 shows that the power factor for the neat PPy with SDS was only 0.0358 μW m−1 K−2. In sharp contrast, all of the rGO/PPy composites revealed greatly improved power factors; especially, when the rGO/Py ratio was 2:1, the power factor of the composite reached as high as 3.01 μW m−1 K−2, 84 times greater than that of the neat PPy with the presence of SDS. Indeed, all of the composites of rGO/PPy displayed larger power factors than that of the bare rGO (1.09 μW m−1 K−2). The mechanism for the greatly enhanced TE property of the rGO/PPy composites is explained briefly by the following two main factors. One is the intrinsic high S and σ of bare rGO. The other is the enwrapped morphology of rGO as the core and PPy as the coated layers. The unique morphology was formed during the template-directed in situ polymerization procedure, in which the monomers of pyrrole polymerized on the surfaces of rGO. Due to the relatively strong interfacial interactions, the PPy molecules might have an ordered alignment, resulting in an enhanced Seebeck coefficient and electrical conductivity. Similar explanations can be found in previous studies.40

Conclusions
With the help of SDS, exfoliated rGO nanosheets were successfully enwrapped by PPy macromolecules via a convenient template-directed in situ polymerization procedure. The wrapping layers of PPy on both sides of rGO nanosheets were highly homogeneous, and whose thickness could be effectively tuned by simply changing the mass ratio of rGO/Py. The SDS was found to have three main contributions: improving the dispersion of rGO nanosheets and dissolution of pyrrole monomers in water, accelerating the polymerization reaction of Py, and increasing the electrical conductivity of PPy. Importantly, the rGO/PPy composites with the wrapping core–shell structure displayed great enhancements in both S and σ. The thermoelectric property (power factor, S2σ) reached as high as 3.01 μW m−1 K−2, 84 times greater than that of the pure PPy. RGO has two main contributions. On one hand, rGO acted as a template to form the enwrapped morphology during the template-directed in situ polymerization process. On the other hand, rGO intrinsically has an excellent S and σ, which benefits the enhancement of the composites' thermoelectric property.
