    , Accepted 24th October 2022First published on 9th November 2022AbstractInorganic–organic perovskites have been considered as one type of promising photoelectric material. However, there are two aspects hindering their application in practice. One is the toxicity of metal lead and the other is the stability of the compound. Herein, the structure, stability, electronic properties, and optical properties of six novel perovskites, MA2B(SCN)2I2 (B = Pb, Sn, Ge) and lead-less MA2Pb1−xSnx(SCN)2I2 (x = 0.25, 0.50, 0.75), have been investigated employing the density functional theory method. The effects of the substitution of Sn/Ge for Pb and Sn-doping on the stability, electronic, and optical properties were also considered. The calculation of formation enthalpy and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations show that the six studied compounds possess good thermodynamic stability. The band structure, partial density of states, Bader charge analysis, electron localization function, and carrier's effective mass were simulated for evaluating the electronic properties of the six perovskites. The metal tin completely or partially replaces metal Pb of MA2Pb(SCN)2I2 perovskites, reduces the band gap of the system and improves carrier's transport ability. The dielectric constants ε(ω), optical absorption coefficient α(ω), energy loss L(ω), refractivity index n(ω) and reflectivity R(ω) were determined for estimating the optical properties of the studied compounds. The introduction of metal tin also enhances the optical absorption range and optical absorption intensity in the UV-vis region. Ge-based perovskite has very similar electronic and optical properties to the MA2Pb(SCN)2I2 compound, but is lead-free. Therefore, among the six studied perovskites, Sn-based systems could be ideal materials for use in the absorption layer of single junction perovskite solar cells, while the MA2Ge(SCN)2I2 compound may also be a good substitute for the MA2Pb(SCN)2I2 compound because it is lead-free with good stability. We hope this work can provide a theoretical foundation for the development of high-performance and lead-free/partially lead free perovskites.
1. Introduction
Over the past decade, inorganic–organic halide perovskites have been the focus of research as they exhibit excellent photovoltaic performance in a new generation of solar cells.1–12 The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells has improved from 3.5% at the beginning to 25.7%,13 which is comparable to the traditional silicon solar cells. However, the instability of materials and toxicity of metal lead still limit their extensive commercial applications.14–17 Much effort has been devoted to improving the long-term stability of perovskites.18–27 Introducing the thiocyanate ion (SCN−) into methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) was considered as a new strategy to acquire highly stable perovskite materials.28–33 Jiang et al. firstly synthesized a perovskite material containing SCN−, MAPb(SCN)2I, which exhibited good stability and the film did not degrade significantly after exposure to air with 95% humidity for 4 h.30 Chen et al. used MAPbI3−xSCNx as the absorber layer of solar cells, and found that the perovskite films work well under conditions of relative humidity of more than 70%, which is comparable to the conventional MAPbI3 absorber layer.31
Lead-based perovskites are likely to lose Pb2+ ions during fabrication and application, which is harmful to the environment.34,35 Therefore, searching for lead-free or partially lead-free perovskites and not sacrificing the photophysical properties are the current research ideas for their extensive applications in solar cells. A common method is to partially or fully replace the Pb2+ ions with other environmentally friendly metal cations, such as Sn2+, Ge2+, Sr2+, Ag+, Ca2+, Na+, Bi3+, Sb3+, Te4+, Cu2+, etc.36–45 Among them, cations Sn2+ and Ge2+ were considered as the most promising alternatives to Pb2+, because they belong to the same IVA group and have similar ionic radii.35,40 It's reported that Sn-based perovskites possess a narrower optical bandgap of approximately 1 eV and higher charge mobility of approximately 102–103 cm2 V−1 s−1 (Pb-based perovskite = 10–102 cm V−1 s−1).41,42 In 2015, Mathews et al. first synthesized three AGeI3 (A = Cs, MA, FA) perovskites and observed that they remain stable at 150 °C and their band gaps can be adjusted by replacing the A-site cation.36 Therefore, Pb/Sn/Ge-based perovskites may be promising candidates for high efficiency solar cell materials in terms of their band gap and absorption properties.43,44 Moreover, metal doping is also an effective measure to regulate the electronic structures and improve the optical properties of perovskites.46,47 Jen et al. synthesized binary Pb–Sn perovskites (CH3NH3Pb1−aSnaI3−xClx) and reported for the first time that their PCE was more than 10%, higher than pure lead perovskites.44 Loi's group synthesized a layered perovskite whose PCE was increased to 9% by mixing a small amount of Sn.45 Recently, Hillebrecht's group developed novel single crystals of MA2Pb(SCN)2I2 that are easy to synthesize and highly stable.48 Xiao et al. demonstrated that the band gap of MA2Pb(SCN)2I2 is between 2.0 and 2.1 eV and it is a suitable absorber for a tandem solar cell.49 Tao's group reported its outstanding stability at high temperatures and under humid conditions.50 These excellent properties of MA2Pb(SCN)2I2 materials hint at their potential for solar cell applications. Obviously, a comprehensive theoretical understanding of MA2Pb(SCN)2I2 materials, including the electronic structures, optoelectronic properties, and structure–property relationship, is needed for their further applications in solar cells.
In addition to the MA2Pb(SCN)2I2 material, five novel Sn2+/Ge2+ substituted perovskites, MA2B(SCN)2I2 (B = Sn, Ge) and MA2Pb1−xSnx(SCN)2I2 (x = 0.25, 0.50, 0.75) have been investigated using the density functional theory (DFT) method. The geometric structures, electronic properties and optical properties of the six compounds have been discussed. In Section 3.1, we present the lattice constants, volume, interatomic distances and bond angles of the six compounds. In Section 3.2, the formation enthalpy and the results of ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations are illustrated. The electronic properties of the six systems, including band structures, partial density of states (PDOS), Bader charge, electron localization functions (ELF), and carriers’ effective mass, are shown in Section 3.3. Besides, the dielectric constants, absorption coefficient, energy loss, reflectivity and refractivity indices are discussed to investigate their photovoltaic properties in Section 3.4. The B-site substitution effects on the electronic properties and photovoltaic properties of the MA2Pb(SCN)2I2 perovskite have been considered for the first time and we hope this work can provide some ideas for the experimental investigation of lead-free/less perovskite solar cell materials.
2. Computational methods
First-principles calculations based on spin-polarized DFT were performed in the investigation of the structures and properties of the six compounds using the Vienna ab initio Simulation Package (VASP).51 The exchange–correlation part of the density functional was treated using the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) approximation of Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE).52,53 The projected augmented wave (PAW) approach was applied to characterize the interaction between ions and valence electrons.54 And the valence electron configurations of the elements involved in the calculations were described as follows: H(1s1), C(2s2p2), N(2s22p3), S(3s23p4), Sn(5s25p2), Ge(4s24p2), I(5s25p5), and Pb(5d106s26p2). All the structures of MA2B(SCN)2I2 (B = Pb, Sn, Ge) and MA2Pb1−xSnx(SCN)2I2 (x = 0.25, 0.50, 0.75) have been fully relaxed using the conjugate gradient algorithm. The atomic positions were optimized until the force converges to 0.05 eV Å−1 and the energy precision reaches 10−5 eV. In addition, the cutoff energy was set to 500 eV. All calculations were carried out with a Γ-centered Monkhorst–Pack 2 × 6 × 6 k-point mesh for the 1 × 2 × 1 supercell containing 100 atoms in total.55 We conducted AIMD simulations in the canonical ensemble (NVT ensemble) using the Nosé–Hoover thermostat at a stationary temperature of 300 K.56 The total time of the simulation is 10 ps with a temporal step of 1.0 fs. The crystal configurations and charge density distribution were manifested by the VESTA package.57
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Crystal structure
The initial atomic positions of orthorhombic MA2Pb(SCN)2I2 single crystals (space group Pmn21) were obtained from the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre.58 The geometric structures of MA2B(SCN)2I2 (B = Pb, Sn, Ge) and three Pb–Sn hybrid perovskites, MA2Pb1−xSnx(SCN)2I2 (x = 0.25, 0.50, 0.75), were optimized by the PBE functional. The obtained relative energies for the hybrid structures of MA2Pb1−xSnx(SCN)2I2 (x = 0.25, 0.50, 0.75) with different doping sites are listed in Table S1 in the ESI.† We select the structure with the lowest energy for further investigations, as shown in Fig. 1 and the corresponding atomic coordinates are listed in Table S2 (ESI†). In the structures of the six studied perovskites, MA organic cations occupy the voids formed by octahedral [B(SCN)2I2]4− anions, which are metal-centered and surrounded by four iodide ions and two sulfur atoms in thiocyanate ions. The calculated lattice parameters and unit cell volume of the six compounds are listed in Table 1. The volume of MA2B(SCN)2I2 (B = Pb, Sn, Ge) decreases with the change of B-site ions from Pb to Sn to Ge, which may be related to the decrease of their ionic radius. For the hybrid compounds, MA2Pb1−xSnx(SCN)2I2, the volumes are bigger than that of three pure metal perovskites. The average interatomic distances of B–I/B–S and the bond angles of B–I–B were respectively arrayed in Tables S3 and S4 of the ESI.† Sn-based compounds present very close bond parameters to those of the MA2Pb(SCN)2I2 compound, while the Ge-based compound exhibits quite different ones to them. This indicates that the introduction or substitution of Sn in the MA2Pb(SCN)2I2 perovskite has a small effect on the structure of compounds, while the substitution of Ge for Pb could lead to a relatively big structure deformation. This may be due to the fact that the radius of the Ge2+ ion (0.73 Å) is smaller than that of the Pb2+ ion (1.19 Å) and Sn2+ ion (1.12 Å).

3.2. Material stability
Formation enthalpy (ΔH) is usually used to assess the thermodynamic stability of perovskite materials and a negative ΔH value indicates that the perovskite is stable generally. The ΔH for the six studied compounds were calculated according to the following eqn (1), (1)where E(MA2Pb1−xSnx(SCN)2I2) represents the total energy of the pure and doped supercell systems, while E(MAI), E(Pb(SCN)2) and E(Sn(SCN)2) denote the total energies of decomposed fragments. For the Pb–Sn hybrid systems, x represents the concentration of Sn doping, including 0.25, 0.50, and 0.75. The obtained total energies and ΔH values of the six compounds are presented in Table 2, and the energetics of decomposed fragments are given in Table S5 of the ESI.† Negative ΔH values of the six compounds indicate their good stability. Among them, MA2Ge(SCN)2I2 has the most negative ΔH value, while Sn-based and Pb-based compounds have a very close ΔH value, which is in accordance with the shorter average Ge–I length and stronger bond coupling of MA2Ge(SCN)2I2.

AIMD simulations were also carried out to further evaluate the thermodynamic stability of the six studied perovskites. The variation of potential energy over time is respectively plotted in Fig. 2. It's noted that the potential energy fluctuates around a fixed energy of about −523 eV. All potential energy fluctuation ranges are below 3 eV, which indicates they will not decompose at room temperature. Therefore, on either Sn-doping or Sn/Ge substitutions, the MA2B(SCN)2I2 perovskites have good stability.

3.3. Electronic properties
The band gap of a perovskite is an important parameter for application in the absorption layer of solar cells. The calculated band gap of MA2B(SCN)2I2 (B = Pb, Sn, Ge) and MA2Pb1−xSnx(SCN)2I2 (x = 0.25, 0.50, 0.75) are listed in Table 3. For the MA2Pb(SCN)2I2 compound, the calculated indirect band gap is 2.01 eV and direct band gap is 2.13 eV, which is in good agreement with the reported values of 2.04 eV and 2.11 eV.49 The obtained indirect and direct band gap of MA2Sn(SCN)2I2 are 1.47 eV and 1.50 eV, respectively, while those of Ge-based compounds are 1.95 eV and 2.04 eV. Evidently, the replacement of Pb by Sn significantly reduces the band gap of the MA2B(SCN)2I2 perovskite, while the substitution of Ge has a negligible effect on it. That is why Sn-doped perovskites are investigated, while Ge-doping is not. The calculated indirect band gap of MA2Pb1−xSnx(SCN)2I2 (x = 0.25, 0.50, 0.75) is between 1.48 eV and 1.61 eV, and the direct band gap is between 1.54 eV and 1.64 eV, which are all obviously lower than those of MA2Pb(SCN)2I2. With the increasing concentration of Sn2+, the band gap of MA2Pb1−xSnx(SCN)2I2 compounds also decreases gradually. Therefore, Sn-doping is also an effective method for decreasing the band gap of MA2Pb(SCN)2I2, while the influence of doping concentration on the band gap is not significant. The indirect band gaps in materials may result in the extra energy required to excite electrons from the valence band to the conduction band, but measures such as strain engineering, chemical doping, and crystal structure shearing can effectively reduce the challenges of photoelectric applications.59–61 For four Sn-based perovskites, the difference between the indirect and direct band gap of perovskites is small, about 0.03–0.09 eV. It is acceptable for their application in optoelectronic material. It is 0.12 eV and 0.09 eV for MA2Pb(SCN)2I2 and MA2Ge(SCN)2I2, respectively. Therefore, all of these Sn-based perovskites have an ideal band gap and smaller indirect–direct band gap difference than those of MA2Pb(SCN)2I2 and MA2Ge(SCN)2I2, which are suitable for application as an absorption layer material for solar cells.62

To get insight into the electronic structure of the six compounds, the band structures of MA2B(SCN)2I2 (B = Pb, Sn, Ge) and MA2Pb1−xSnx(SCN)2I2 (x = 0.25, 0.50, 0.75) along the high symmetry directions i.e. Γ(0, 0, 0), Y(0, 1/2, 0), T(0, 1/2, 1/2), Z(0, 0, 1/2), X(1/2, 0, 0), S(1/2, 1/2, 0), and R(1/2, 1/2, 1/2) of the Brillouin zone are depicted in Fig. 3a–f, respectively. All of the Fermi levels are located on the valence band maximum (VBM) and set to zero. Except that the VBM of MA2Ge(SCN)2I2 is located at the Γ point, the other five Pb/Sn-based compounds have similar band structures, in which the VBM is located at the Z point and the conduction band minimum (CBM) is slightly deviated from the Z point, as denoted by green arrows. Combined with the small difference between indirect and direct band gaps mentioned earlier, Sn-based perovskites can be considered to have a near direct band gap. For Sn-involved systems, the CBM gradually shifts towards the lower energy with the Sn concentration increasing, however, the CBM of MA2Ge(SCN)2I2 has no obvious movement compared with MA2Pb(SCN)2I2. It is consistent with the change of their band gap and may be the main reason for the band gap variation.
 Fig. 3  Band structure of (a) MA2Pb(SCN)2I2, (b) MA2Sn(SCN)2I2, (c) MA2Ge(SCN)2I2, (d) MA2Pb0.75Sn0.25(SCN©2, (e) MA2Pb0.50Sn0.50(SCN)2I2, and (f) MA2Pb0.25Sn0.75(SCN)2I2 perovskites. The dash line represents the Fermi level located at zero. 
To understand electron contribution to the valence bands (VBs) and conduction bands (CBs), we simulated the PDOS of the six compounds with energies ranging from −5 eV to 5 eV, as presented in Fig. 4a–f. For perovskite MA2Pb(SCN)2I2, VB is primarily constituted by I-5p, SCN-p and Pb-6s orbitals, while the CB is mainly occupied by the Pb-6p orbital. The bands appearing at −4 to −5 eV are predominantly contributed by SCN and MA ions, which are away from the VBM. While for the MA2Sn(SCN)2I2 compound, its VB is also mainly composed of I-5p, SCN-p, and new Sn-5s orbitals, and its CB is mainly contributed by Sn-5p, I-5p, and SCN-p orbitals. The PDOS of MA2Sn(SCN)2I2 shows that Sn-5p, I-5p, and I-5s orbitals extend towards lower energy in its CBM, which results in a lower band gap than MA2Pb(SCN)2I2. The VB and CB of the Ge-based compound have similar compositions to those of Pb-based compounds, except that the Ge-4s orbital replaces Pb-6s in the VB and the Ge-4p orbital replaces the Pb-6p orbital in the CB. The energies of these orbitals in the CBM of MA2Ge(SCN)2I2 have little variation compared to MA2Pb(SCN)2I2, thus the band gaps of the two systems are almost the same. For the Pb/Sn hybrid perovskites, with the increase of the Sn-doping concentration, the contributions of Pb orbitals to the VB and CB gradually decrease, while the contributions of Sn orbitals gradually increase. The interactions between Sn and I also lead to the p orbitals of Pb extending towards the lower energy region, thus lowering the CBM. Therefore, the introduction of Sn lowers the CBM, further reducing the band gap of the compound. According to the PDOS of the six compounds, it seems that the orbitals of the B-site metal atom play an important role in the energy conversion properties of MA2B(SCN)2I2. So the respective PDOS of Pb, Sn, and I atoms for MA2Pb(SCN)2I2, MA2Pb0.50Sn0.50(SCN)2I2, and MA2Sn(SCN)2I2 has been plotted and shown in Fig. S1 of the ESI.† It is clear that the introduction of Sn affects the location of the CBM, but not the VBM. Compared to MA2Pb(SCN)2I2, the PDOS of Pb-6p in MA2Pb0.50Sn0.50(SCN)2I2 moves towards lower energy and that of I-5s and I-5p in MA2Sn(SCN)2I2 also shifts towards lower energy. Combined with the lower Sn-5p orbital energy, the CBM of perovskite decreases with Sn introduction, which is ascribed to the coupling of Sn and I orbitals. The PDOS of MA+ is mainly located at −4 to −5 eV for the six studied systems and the orbital energies of MA+ in Sn-based and Ge-based compounds are lower than that of MA2Pb(SCN)2I2. The value is far away from the Fermi energy level, which suggests that MA+ is hardly involved in the photoelectron transition. Therefore, the function of organic MA cations is to balance the charge neutrality and stabilize the framework of MA2B(SCN)2I2 perovskites, similar to other perovskites.63 There is no obvious coupling between the MA+ and I−, indicating that the force between them is that of an ionic bond.

Bader charge analysis was carried out to evaluate the charge transfer of the six different B-site perovskites.64 The obtained average Bader charge of Pb, Sn, Ge, and MA-cations, and the SCN group are listed in Table 4. The positive value of charges represents charge depletion, and the negative value denotes charge accumulation. The results show that the average Bader charge of Pb, Sn, and Ge is positive, while those of I atoms and the SCN group are negative, which indicates that the electron is transferred from the metal atom to I or the SCN group, as usual. The Bader charges of Pb and Sn are very close in five Pb/Sn-based compounds, larger than that of Ge. Similarly, anions of Pb/Sn-based compounds present close Bader charges, more negative than those of Ge-based compounds. This indicates that Pb replaced by Ge reduces the charge transfer between the metal and the anion, while replacement with Sn has little effect on it. The Bader charge of the MA-cation has no obvious change in the six compounds, which further shows that the MA cation is not involved in the photoelectron transition, as mentioned earlier.

The ELF is described in Fig. 5 to understand the atomic interaction of the six compounds. The electron localization value of I is about 0.6, while that of Pb, Sn, and Ge is about 0.25, 0.85, and 0.85. With the change of the B-site atom from Pb to Sn to Ge, the interaction between B and I or the SCN group is strengthened, which indicates more covalent interactions are involved in MA2Ge(SCN)2I2. It is in agreement with the result of Bader analysis that there is less electron transfer between Ge and I. Three Pb/Sn hybrid systems have very similar ELF contours with Sn having overlapping electron localization with I, while this is not so for Pb. The organic MA cations are not associated with the metal ions or halide ions in the six systems, which is consistent with the analysis of the band structure.

The carriers’ effective mass is usually used to estimate the carrier transport ability and electrical conductivity of perovskites. The compounds with small effective mass will have ambipolar conductivity and an ultralong carrier diffusion length.65,66 We calculated the effective masses of electrons (me) and effective masses of holes (mh) along the 001 direction in the reciprocal space by fitting the band structure around the CBM and VBM using the following equation,67 (2)where ε(k) is the band edge eigenvalue and k is the wavevector. The obtained me and mh are presented in Table 5. For MA2Pb(SCN)2I2 the value of me is 0.257m0 and that of mh is 0.683m0. As Sn replaces Pb, both values of me and mh decrease, while when Ge replaces Pb, the me value decreases and mh value increases. The me and mh values of three Pb/Sn hybrid compounds are between those of MA2Pb(SCN)2I2 and MA2Sn(SCN)2I2. Therefore, the substitution or doping of Sn in the MA2Pb(SCN)2I2 perovskite decreases the electron and hole effective masses, thus improving its carrier transport ability, while the introduction of Ge improves only the electron transport ability. Moreover, the effective mass of holes is larger than that of electrons for the six compounds, indicating that the mobility of electrons is stronger than that of holes for all studied perovskites.

3.4. Optical properties
Light absorption capability is crucial for the application of perovskites in solar cells. Herein, dielectric constants ε(ω), absorption coefficient α(ω), energy loss L(ω), refractivity index n(ω) and reflectivity R(ω) were simulated for investigating the optical properties of the six compounds. The dielectric constants ε(ω) is calculated by eqn (3)–(5), ε(ω) = ε1(ω) + iε2(ω)(3) (4) (5)in which ε2(ω) denotes the imaginary component that is depicted through momentum matrix elements between the occupied and unoccupied wave functions, while ε1(ω) represents the real part related to ε2(ω) in Kramers–Kronig transformation. Both ε1(ω) and ε2(ω) of the six compounds are respectively depicted in Fig. 6.
 Fig. 6  Calculated real dielectric constant ε1(ω) of (a) MA2B(SCN)2I2 (B = Pb, Sn, Ge) and (b) MA2Pb1−xSnx(SCN)2I2 (x = 0.25, 0.50, 0.75) and imaginary dielectric constant ε2(ω) of (c) MA2B(SCN)2I2 (B = Pb, Sn, Ge) and (d) MA2Pb1−xSnx(SCN)2I2 (x = 0.25, 0.50, 0.75). 
Generally, ε1(0) is negatively correlated to exciton binding energy and a larger ε1(0) is beneficial for the separation of electrons and holes, which is favored for application in solar cells.68 As shown in Fig. 6a, ε1(0) values of Pb, Sn, and Ge-based perovskites are 4.46, 4.90, and 4.21, respectively, which suggest that the MA2Sn(SCN)2I2 perovskite is optimal among them for application in solar cells. For three Pb–Sn hybrid systems, the calculated ε1(0) values are between those of MA2Pb(SCN)2I2 and MA2Sn(SCN)2I2, which indicates that Sn-doping or replacing is helpful for improving the optical properties of the MA2Pb(SCN)2I2 perovskite. The ε1(ω) curves of the six compounds are similar with the first peak appearing at 1.5–2.1 eV and gradually declining, while the introduction of Sn causes a red-shift. ε2(ω) represents the absorption of impinging photons caused by electron excitations from the valence bound state to the conduction empty state. As shown in Fig. 6c and d, several peaks appear in the region of 0–5 eV, which originated from the transitions between different electronic states. The ε2(ω) curves of MA2Sn(SCN)2I2 and MA2Pb0.25Sn0.75(SCN)2I2 compounds present obvious red-shift behavior, however, the MA2Ge(SCN)2I2 compound has a very close curve in the visible range, compared to that of MA2Pb(SCN)2I2. It is well consistent with the variation of their band gaps.
The α(ω) of the six compounds were calculated by the formula (6)and shown in Fig. 7. For the six compounds, α(ω) gradually increases in the energy region of 0–5 eV. Fig. 7a shows that compared to MA2Pb(SCN)2I2, the spectrum of MA2Sn(SCN)2I2 presents an obvious red-shift and that of MA2Ge(SCN)2I2 has only a tiny red-shift, which indicates that the replacement of Pb by Sn expands the range of light absorption significantly. As shown in Fig. 7b, the spectrum of MA2Pb1−xSnx(SCN)2I2 also exhibits red-shift behaviors with increasing Sn-doping concentration. Both the broad light absorption range and strong light absorption intensity of the perovskite are important for improving the efficiency of solar cells. For MA2Pb(SCN)2I2, the α(ω) is about 4.32 × 104 at the first peak of 2.63 eV. The substitution of Sn and Ge for Pb, respectively, increases and decreases the absorption intensity at the first peak position. Similarly, among three Pb–Sn hybrid compounds, the absorption intensity of MA2Pb0.25Sn0.75(SCN)2I2 is the highest at the first peak position of 2.23 eV, while the other two are very close. Hence, the introduction of Sn improves both the light absorption range and light absorption intensity of MA2Pb(SCN)2I2, while the substitution of Ge with Pb has a negligible effect on both optical properties.

The L(ω), n(ω), and R(ω) can be described by eqn (7)–(9),69–71 (7) (8) (9)and the results are plotted in Fig. 8. L(ω) describes the energy loss during the high speed electronic transition inside the material. For all the studied perovskites, L(ω) is below 0.11 in the visible range and drops sharply when energy exceeds over 20 eV. It indicates that the energy loss of these materials is small in practical applications. The calculated n(ω) of MA2Sn(SCN)2I2 also exhibits an obvious red shift, while that of MA2Ge(SCN)2I2 is close to that of the MA2Pb(SCN)2I2 compound in the higher energy region. The higher n(ω) value and the slower the photon travels through the material. The MA2Sn(SCN)2I2 compound have a higher n(ω) than MA2Pb(SCN)2I2, while MA2Ge(SCN)2I2 shows the smallest value in the visible range. For three hybrid compounds, the n(ω) of MA2Pb0.25Sn0.75(SCN)2I2 shows a red-shift curve and has a higher n(ω) than the other two. Furthermore, the obtained R(ω) of the six compounds shows a similar trend to their refractivity index. The R(ω) curves of MA2Sn(SCN)2I2 and MA2Pb0.25Sn0.75(SCN)2I2 also exhibit a red shift compared to that of MA2Pb(SCN)2I2. The R0(ω) values of MA2B(SCN)2I2 (B = Pb, Sn, Ge) are 16.06%, 19.12% and 11.79%, respectively, while the maximum R(ω) values in the visible light region are 26.63%, 30.77% and 17.52%. Among three hybrid perovskites, MA2Pb0.25Sn0.75(SCN)2I2 has the maximum R(ω) value of 28.75% in the visible light region. In summary, the substitution or doping of Sn improves the optical performance of MA2Pb(SCN)2I2 and both MA2Sn(SCN)2I2 and MA2Pb0.25Sn0.75(SCN)2I2 perovskites possess ideal optical properties for application in solar cells or other photoelectric devices.

4. Conclusions
DFT calculations were performed to investigate the stability and optoelectronic properties of MA2B(SCN)2I2 (B = Pb, Sn, Ge) and MA2Pb1−xSnx(SCN)2I2 (x = 0.25, 0.50, 0.75) perovskites. The investigations of the structure, formation enthalpy, and dynamic trajectory of the six compounds demonstrate that they all have good structural and thermodynamic stability. The band structures of MA2B(SCN)2I2 (B = Pb, Sn, Ge) and MA2Pb1−xSnx(SCN)2I2 (x = 0.25, 0.50, 0.75) compounds show that all of them possess a nearly direct band gap except for MA2Ge(SCN)2I2. The replacement of Pb by Sn or Sn-doping is an effective method to tune the band gap, in which it is narrowed from 2.01 eV of MA2Pb(SCN)2I2 to 1.47–1.61 eV of Sn-based compounds. The band gaps of MA2Sn(SCN)2I2 and MA2Pb1−xSnx(SCN)2I2 are considered appropriate for their application in the single junction solar cells. The analysis of electron localization and Bader charge indicate that more covalent interaction is involved with the change of the B site metal from Pb to Sn to Ge. Moreover, the introduction of Sn decreases the effective masses of electrons and holes, manifesting that carrier mobility is improved in four Sn-based systems, while the substitution of Ge only reduces the effective masses of electrons. The investigations on optical properties of the six studied perovskites show both spectra of MA2Sn(SCN)2I2 and MA2Pb0.25Sn0.75(SCN)2I2 exhibit obvious red-shift behavior in optical absorption coefficient α(ω), refractivity index n(ω), and reflectivity R(ω), compared to MA2Pb(SCN)2I2, indicating their stronger absorption intensity and wider absorption range than others. MA2Ge(SCN)2I2 has very similar curves to MA2Pb(SCN)2I2. The obtained results suggest that Sn-involved MA2B(SCN)2I2 perovskites could be excellent candidates for the absorption layer in solar cells. And the MA2Ge(SCN)2I2 compound is also an environmentally friendly substitute of MA2Pb(SCN)2I2 used in optoelectronic devices. Further experimental investigations are expected for the application of these new perovskites.
