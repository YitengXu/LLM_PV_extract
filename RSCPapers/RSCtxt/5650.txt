    , Accepted 4th September 2017First published on 6th September 2017AbstractThe development of hybrid tin (Sn)–lead (Pb) perovskite solar cells likely tackles the toxic problem with the power conversion efficiency (PCE) exceeding 17%. However, the stability problems, e.g. hysteresis effect, degeneration and oxidation, appear to be the bottleneck that limit its further development. Here, we innovatively introduced C60 at the grain boundaries throughout the CH3NH3Pb0.75Sn0.25I3 (MAPb0.75Sn0.25I3) thin film, playing a role not only in in situ passivating the interfaces and reducing the pinholes of perovskite thin films, but also in preventing the penetration of moisture and oxygen from ambient atmosphere. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) illustrated that the recombination lifetime of both the bulk and surface of MAPb0.75Sn0.25I3 thin films was increased by additive incorporation of C60. Dark I–V results for the electron/hole-only devices showed that the charge trap-state density decreased with C60 additive incorporated into the hybrid Sn–Pb perovskite thin films. Importantly, the hybrid Sn–Pb perovskite solar cells modified with C60 additive were demonstrated to have superior stability and efficiency when exposed to the ambient environment without encapsulation.
Introduction
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have achieved significant progress due to their appealing advantages of intense broad-band absorption, higher charge carrier mobility and longer charge diffusion length.1 Their power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) have increased rapidly from 3.8% to over 22% within seven years.2–6 Unfortunately, to date, almost all of the perovskite solar cells with high efficiency are based on the traditional pure lead halide perovskite materials.7 To speed up their commercialization, the material's intrinsic toxicity and stability should be paid more attention besides the efficiency.8,9 Recently, researchers have focused on the (MA/FA)Pb(1−x)SnxI3 (x ≤ 1) PSCs with significantly improved PCEs. For x < 0.5, Jen et al. reported a combined compositional process and interfacial engineering to develop highly efficient and stable MA0.5FA0.5Pb0.75Sn0.25I3 PSCs to realize a PCE of up to 14.19%.10 Choy et al. demonstrated high-quality preferential orientation MASn0.25Pb0.75I3 thin films and gained the PCE of 15.2% by using PC61BM:C60 (3:1 by weight) as the electron transport layer.11 For x = 0.5, Huang et al. reported a Pb-assisted, two-step spin-coating method to construct MASn0.5Pb0.5I3 PSCs and showed a PCE of up to 13.6%.12 Snaith et al. demonstrated cesium-containing FA0.75Cs0.25Sn0.5Pb0.5I3 thin film and delivered 14.8% efficiency.13 For x > 0.5, Sadhanala et al. demonstrated a novel elevated temperature processing method to prepare uniform Sn–Pb-based low-bandgap perovskite thin films, achieving over 10% with MAPb0.4Sn0.6I3 PSCs.14 Yan et al. developed a new precursor combining FASnI3 with MAPbI3, and the as-prepared (FASnI3)0.6(MAPbI3)0.4 reached the PCE of 15.08%.15 Soon afterward, they optimized the conditions and finally achieved the highest PCE of 17.6%.16 For x = 1, Yan et al. demonstrated the highest PCE of over 6.22% for Pb-free planar FASnI3 PSC with a simple inverted device architecture.17
Considering the rapid crystallization of Sn-based perovskite films, in our previous report, we have introduced solvent engineering, which allowed the formation of the PbI2/SnI2(DMSO)x complex precursor, followed by molecular exchange to obtain high-quality MAPb1−xSnxI3 perovskite thin films. The optimized MAPb0.75Sn0.25I3 perovskite solar cells with inverted structure consequently realized a maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 14.12%.18 However, there still have some problems to be solved: (i) the average PCE of MAPb0.75Sn0.25I3 perovskite solar cell is about 12.6%, which is much lower in comparison to the highest PCE of 14.12%; (ii) the hybrid Sn–Pb perovskite solar cells still have larger hysteresis effect even with inverted structure; (iii) inferior stability when the hybrid Sn–Pb devices are exposed to ambient environment.
The challenges mentioned above in hybrid Sn–Pb perovskite solar cells may be attributed to the intrinsic property of easy oxidation from Sn2+ to Sn4+.19 The groups of Seok, Kanatzidis and Mathews have reported that the introduction of tin fluoride (SnF2) could effectively reduce Sn4+ content.20–22 Besides, Wang et al. have demonstrated the HPA additive, as a complexant, to be capable of speeding up the nucleation process while inhibiting Sn4+ formation during the formation of CsSnIBr2 thin films.23 In these works, both SnF2 and HPA were strong reducing agents, which were used to suppress the oxidization of Sn2+ by chemical method. On the other hand, considering the chemical degeneration caused by moisture, Wang et al. have certified that post-modification by Al2O3 played roles in both protecting perovskites from degradation and suppressing the interfacial electron recombination.24 Recently, Gerbaldi et al. have reported a strongly hydrophobic photopolymer grown on the back contact side, behaving as an efficient barrier that prevents water permeation within the solar cell stack.25 Both the Al2O3 and photopolymer material were hydrophobic materials, which were used as the barrier from moisture by physical encapsulation.
Nevertheless, neither the chemical method nor the physical encapsulation could intrinsically tackle the stability issue of Sn-based perovskite solar cells. Sargent and Wu et al. have added the fullerene derivative PCBM (phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester) into the spin-coating solution and eventually formed the perovskite–PCBM hybrid solid,26,27 which passivated the key PbI3− antisite defects during the process of perovskite self-assembly, thereby reducing the electric field-induced anion migration that may give rise to hysteresis and unstable diode behavior. Similarly, C60 was demonstrated to have the advantages of passivating the perovskite thin film surfaces and facilitating electron transport with reduced leakage loss due to its wide band gap, high mobility, and low charge transport resistance.28 Thus, it was widely used as the electron transport layer in organic solar cells and perovskite solar cells.28–30 Likewise, C60 has much higher electron mobility (1.6 cm V s−1) and conductivity (2.3 × 10−3 S cm−1) in comparison to PCBM, with the electron mobility value of 6.1 × 10−2 cm V s−1 and conductivity of 3.2 × 10−4 S cm−1.31 In this scenario, there may be more theoretical advantages to facilitate intermolecular charge transport if C60 is distributed at perovskite grain boundaries throughout the film.
Here, we introduced the C60 additive to hybrid Sn–Pb perovskite films with an aim of in situ passivating the grain boundary and preventing the penetration of oxygen and moisture from ambient atmosphere, which is favorable to enhance the stability and alleviate the hysteresis of MAPb0.75Sn0.25I3 perovskite solar cells. In this work, C60 was used as additive in the hybrid Sn–Pb precursor solution to guarantee uniform doping in molecular dimensions and distribution at the perovskite grain boundary after thin film fabrication. By optimizing the doping concentration of C60 in the precursor solution, PCE values as high as 13.9% can be obtained for MAPb0.75Sn0.25I3 perovskite solar cells with highly alleviated hysteresis effects, and only 20% PCE decay was observed after the corresponding solar cell without encapsulation was exposed in air for 7 days.
Experimental
Materials and methods
The FTO-coated glass (8 Ω cm−2, Beneq TFS 200) was sequentially cleaned with deionized water, acetone and alcohol in an ultrasonic cleaning machine. After drying in a N2 stream, the substrates were further treated under oxygen plasma for 10 min. PEDOT:PSS (Heraeus-Clevios P 4083, Xi'an p-OLED) was spun on the as-treated substrate at a speed of 3500 rounds per minute (rpm) after dilution with water at the volume ratio of 1:1. The substrates were then annealed at 140 °C for 10 min. 170 mg of PbI2 (Alfa Aesar, 99.9985%) and 46 mg SnI2 (Aldrich, 99.99%) were dissolved in a mixed solvent containing 256 μL of DMF (Aldrich, 99.9%) and 64 μL of DMSO (Aldrich, 99.9%). After complete dissolution, 1.5 mg C60 was added into the precursor solution, and the solution was filtered. The mixed precursor solution was spun on the PEDOT:PSS layer at 5000 (rpm) for 30 s. Then, the MAI solution with the concentration of 60 mg ml−1 was spun on the substrate at 5000 (rpm) for 30 s. Afterward, the obtained thin films were annealed at 110 °C for 20 min. The 6,6-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) dissolved into dichlorobenzene with the concentration of 20 mg ml−1 was spun on the top of the as-prepared perovskite layers at 2500 (rpm) for 30 s. Finally, 6 nm 2,9-dimethyl-4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline (BCP) and 120 nm Ag electrode were sequentially deposited by thermal evaporation. Note that all of the film fabrications were processed in a nitrogen-filled glovebox.
Characterization
The crystal structure was characterized by Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer (XRD) with CuKα radiation at 40 kV and 40 mA. Field-emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to characterize the morphology of the obtained thin film. Both top-down and cross-sectional views were obtained using a FEI NovaNanoSEM450. A double-beam spectrophotometer (Lambda 950, PerkinElmer) equipped with an integrated sphere was used for the UV-vis absorption measurements in the range of 300–1100 nm. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was measured with a PHI 5300 ESCA PerkinElmer spectrometer. All spectra were shifted to account for sample charging using inorganic carbon at 284.80 eV as a reference. UPS were analyzed on Thermo Scientific ESCALab 250Xi. Gas discharge lamp was used for UPS, with helium gas admitted and the HeI (21.22 eV) emission line employed. The data were acquired with −10 V bias. The electrochemical impedance spectra were measured using an electrochemical workstation (ZAHNER CIMPS, Germany). The fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy was measured using a FV1200 laser scanning confocal microscopy. A 514 nm pulsed diode laser was used for excitation, with repetition rate of 40 MHz.
Current–voltage (J–V) characteristics of perovskite solar cells were measured using a semiconductor device analyzer (Keithley 2601B) and a SAN-EI solar simulator (XES-100S1) with an AM 1.5 G spectrum. The illumination power on the sample was adjusted to 1000 W m−2 using a certified reference solar cell (RS-ID-4). A black mask with an aperture (9 mm2) was placed on the top of the device to control the effective electrode area. Both forward and backward scans were performed, and the scan speed was fixed at 0.15 V s−1. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the perovskite solar cell device was measured by using a spectrum corresponding system (QTesT 1000ADX), with the monochromatic light wavelength ranging from 350 nm to 1100 nm. The monochromatic light beam is produced by a dual grating monochromatic in front of a halogen lamp. A Si reference solar cell with known EQE was used to determine the spectral response of perovskite solar cells.
Results and discussion
Due to the unique structure as a spherical, symmetric, nonpolar molecule, C60 is able to combine with some solvent molecules to form a charge transfer complex. According to the like-dissolves-like rule, the formation of charge transfer complex could enable the C60 to disperse in some organic solvents at a low solubility.32 The left photo of Fig. S1a† exhibits the transparent DMSO:DMF mixed solvent with the volume ratio of 1:5. The right one is the saturated solution of C60 in DMSO:DMF mixed solvent with slightly brown color. To prepare the saturated solution, excess C60 (5 mg) was added into 1 mL DMSO:DMF mixed solvent; after shocking at 25 °C for 10 min, the supernatant was extracted. Similarly, Fig. S1b† exhibits the pristine precursor (left) and C60-introduced precursor (right) with deeper color. We used the spectrophotometer to determine the concentration of C60 saturated solution in the precursor solution, with the known concentration of C60 dissolved in 1,2-dichlorobenzene (5 mg mL−1) as the standard solution. Fig. S2† shows the corresponding absorption spectra of these two solutions. The absorbance value of the standard solution and the C60 saturated solution are 3.5 and 0.07 at the wavelength of 600 nm, respectively. According to the formula A = εlc, we calculated that the concentration of C60 saturated solution was 0.1 mg mL−1, a relatively smaller concentration compared to the PbI2/SnI2 precursor.
In our previous reports, it was demonstrated that PbI2 and SnI2 complexed with the DMSO molecules, which allowed the formation of the PbI2/SnI2(DMSO)x complex.18,33 Similarly, in the present study, C60 was dissolved into the precursor solution, in which the PbI2 and SnI2 complexed with the DMSO molecules. As shown in the Scheme 1, due to the certain order of magnitude of binding energy (839 kJ m−3) between the C60 and DMSO molecules, the C60 was wrapped around by the DMSO molecules and formed a solvent shell,34 along with mixing together with the PbI2/SnI2(DMSO)x complex. Afterward, the molecule exchange process between DMSO and MAI was followed, after the MAI solution was spin-coated. Finally, the MAPb1−xSnxI3 perovskite thin films were obtained by annealing process, with the evaporation of solvent molecules and the C60 distribution at the grain boundary of perovskites. It is worth noting that the presence of binding energy between C60 and DMSO molecules is expected to tune the crystallization process of perovskites, giving rise to the formation of perovskite thin film with decreased pinholes and uniformed distribution of C60 at the grain boundary. In the first step to form PbI2/SnI2 precursor thin film, the grain size decreased due to the increased surface energy caused by impure C60 additive, as shown in Fig. 1a and b. Fig. 1c and d display the SEM images of controlled perovskite and C60-additive perovskite films; these two films are homogeneous with similar crystalline domain size, but obviously less pinholes appeared in the C60-additive perovskite film, confirming our speculation. In addition, a certain number of small particles of PbI2 and/or SnI2 existed in perovskite film surface after high-temperature annealing process.

Due to the less conductive property of PbI2 and/or SnI2 compared with perovskite, the PbI2/SnI2 particles exhibited relatively bright color, as marked in Fig. 1c–e with red dotted lines. Further verification of XRD parents were demonstrated as seen in Fig. S6,† where the peaks at 14.08°, 28.41°, and 31.85° are assigned to tetragonal phase perovskite crystal, and the peak at 12.65° corresponds to PbI2/SnI2. The presence of PbI2 and/or SnI2 is commonly believed to be beneficial to efficiency, as they have been proposed to passivate the defects in perovskite grain boundaries.35,36 But excess PbI2 and/or SnI2 will accelerate perovskite film degradation under illumination and humidity.37 So how to balance the advantage and disadvantage so that it can work as constructively? In this work, we introduced the C60 homogeneously distributed at the grain boundaries with the target of not only enhancing the initial efficiency but also inhibiting the decomposition of perovskite induced by PbI2/SnI2. Fig. 1e is a cross-sectional SEM image of the inverted MAPb0.75Sn0.25I3 hybrid perovskite solar cell with C60 additive. Clearly, the high-density and large-grain-sized perovskite crystals are closely packed to form pinhole-free thin films, which is expected to significantly reduce the trap-state density.
To figure out the influence of C60 on the surfaces and grain boundaries of the perovskite layers, we employed electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) to gain insight into the bulk and interfacial charge recombination process by means of analyzing the frequency-dependent alternating current response with appropriate equivalent circuits.38,39 Similar to the literature, in our inverted p–i–n perovskite solar cell devices, we used the resistor–capacitor (RC) circuits to separately model the bulk and interface recombination contribution.39 The equivalent circuit is shown in the inset of Fig. 2a, the Nyquist plots obtained between the frequency range from 106 Hz to 10−1 Hz under illumination in the range of 0.1 V to 0.6 V can be well fitted, as shown in the Fig. S4.† It can be extracted two time constants from the fitting results by the equation of τ = R × C, which were respectively corresponded to the surface recombination lifetime (τsurface) and bulk recombination lifetime (τbulk). According to the literature, the bulk charge recombination is much slower than the surface charge recombination because of the high crystallization of perovskite material.39Fig. 2a and b show the calculated time constant results under different bias values of the films with and without C60 additive. Obviously, both the τsurface and τbulk are increased after C60 introduced. It may result from a better bonding effect via formation of a perovskite–C60 hybrid, which decreased the pinholes and recombination centers. Thus, the C60 additive can significantly reduce the surface and bulk trap density as a result of interface passivation and increasing total injected charge density.

Dark I–V curve of the MAPb0.75Sn0.25I3 films with (c) electron-only devices and (d) hole-only devices displaying the VTFL kink point behavior, with an inset showing the device structure. 
In addition, the electron-only device (FTO/PCBM/MAPb0.75Sn0.25I3/PCBM/Ag) and hole-only device (FTO/PEDOT:PSS/MAPb0.75Sn0.25I3/Ag) were prepared to separately measure the electron and hole trap-state density in the hybrid Sn–Pb perovskite layers using a dark I–V technique. Fig. 2c and d display a kink in the dark I–V cure for the devices with and without C60 additive. The linear increasing area indicates an ohmic response, whereas the quick non-linear increasing area indicates fully filled trap states.40 Between these two domains, the voltage at the kink point is called the trap-filled limit voltage VTFL, and the trap states density is determined by eqn (1):41 (1)where the ntrap is the corresponding trap state density, L is the thickness of MAPb0.75Sn0.25I3 hybrid Sn–Pb perovskite absorption layer, e is the electron elementary charge, ε is the relative dielectric constant of MAPb0.75Sn0.25I3 perovskite material, and ε0 is the vacuum permittivity. According to the literature, the value of ε is about 35 when the oscillation frequency is 1 kHz.42 In the electron-only device, the VTFL of the control device is 0.16 V, and that of C60 additive is 0.1 V. The corresponding electron trap-state density values are 4.3 × 1015 cm−3 and 2.7 × 1015 cm−3, respectively. Likewise, in the hole-only device, the VTFL of the control device is 0.175 V, and that of C60 additive is 0.08 V. The corresponding hole trap-state density values are 4.7 × 1015 cm−3 and 2.1 × 1015 cm−3, respectively. The decreasing amount of charge trap states may also attribute to the enhanced, pinhole-free film quality.
We further carried out fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) to detect the PL lifetime of the films prepared using the control and C60-additive conditions, respectively. The corresponding images are shown as Fig. 3a and b. Regional fluorescent color represents the quantified lifetime, and the transition from cool color to warm color represents the enhancement of fluorescent lifetime. Besides, the black color in the image represents the areas, where no fluorescence has been detected. Clearly, some areas are light-green in Fig. 3a, in contrast to areas with blue in Fig. 3b, which demonstrates a longer fluorescence lifetime overall for the control film. The quantified lifetime concluded from FLIM of the corresponding films is shown in Fig. 3c. The comparison of quantified lifetimes was made to investigate the impact of C60 on electron extraction. Herein, the quenching of fluorescence lifetime indicated efficient electronic coupling between the C60 phase and the perovskite. The fluorescence decay curves were exponentially fitted. The FLIM decay times for glass/perovskite are τ1 = 0.26 ns and τ2 = 1.815 ns, respectively. For the glass/perovskite–C60, τ1 and τ2 drop to 0.24 ns and 1.35 ns. Compared to the glass/perovskite film, the quenching of fluorescence lifetime of glass/perovskite–C60 further proves the efficient charge pumping of C60 additive. Therefore, in Fig. 3b, the black areas that show uniform distribution at the grain boundary are corresponded to the distribution of C60 after additive due to the quenching effect. To provide more direct evidences to verify the existence of C60 at the grain boundary, the as-prepared C60-additive perovskite thin films were immersed into 1,2-dichlorobenzene solvent for 30 min. The supernatant was then filtered and centrifuged before the UV-vis absorption measurement. The obtained UV-vis spectrum is shown in Fig. S3.† C60 radical anion's absorption peak at 600 nm is identified, which clearly shows the presence of C60 additive inside the perovskites and its re-dissolution in the 1,2-dichlorobenzene solvent.

The discussion above comprehensively studied the beneficial impact of C60 additive on MAPb0.75Sn0.25I3 film. To identify the optimum concentration of C60 in the precursor solution, systematic J–V characterizations of the C60 additive device were tested. The results are shown in Fig. 4a, and the photovoltaic performance of solar cells as a function of the concentration of C60 additive is shown in Table 1. Clearly, the concentration of 0.05 mg mL−1 shows the best PCE of 13.7%, with the enhancement of Jsc and FF mostly owing to the improvement of crystallization quality. A slight Voc deficit occurred for the C60 additive devices, likely due to the deeper LUMO level of C60 than that of PCBM, which shortened the energy gap between the HOMO level of p-type hole transport material and LUMO level of n-type electron transport material in the p–i–n structural perovskite solar cells. It should be noted that only a suitable concentration of C60 additive has the ideal passivation function at the grain boundaries. If the C60 concentration is too low, the passivation effect will be not obvious, whereas an electron transport barrier will be formed while the concentration is too high, which would affect the photovoltaic performance of the device. All the following mentioned C60 additive concentrations will refer to 0.05 mg mL−1 unless otherwise specified. Fig. 4c shows the photovoltaic properties of hybrid Sn–Pb perovskite solar cells with and without C60 additive. The introduction of C60 led to the improvement of PCE, which increased from 12.6 to 13.9%. As expected, the C60-additive planar hybrid Sn–Pb perovskite solar cells exhibited no apparent J–V hysteresis effects, whereas the control planar hybrid Sn–Pb perovskite solar cells revealed a significant J–V hysteresis when the scan direction is changed. The enhancement of Jsc, FF and decrement of hysteresis effect are considered to be associated with the suppressed interfacial charge recombination and bulk recombination in the device due to the passivation effect. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) and the calculated Jsc of the solar cells with and without C60 additive are shown in Fig. 4d. The enhancement of photo response in the short wavelength is likely associated with the relatively fewer pinholes in the films prepared using C60 additive. Note that the presence of pinholes would give rise to more defects on the film interface, which consequently directly influences the photo response in short wavelengths, as the absorption of high-energy photons mostly occurred in the shallow region of the perovskite thin film.43,44 The energy band diagram of the hybrid Sn–Pb-based planar perovskite solar cells with C60 additive employed as the interface modification material is represented in Fig. 4b. The bandgap of MAPb0.75Sn0.25I3 is about 1.3 eV, reported by our previous work.18 In this work, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels were measured and fitted by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS). Details of test and analysis data are provided in Fig. S5.† Compared with the pure Pb-based perovskite material (MAPbI3), the hybrid Sn–Pb perovskite materials shows deeper HOMO and LUMO. Opportunely, the MAPb0.75Sn0.25I3 hybrid Sn–Pb perovskite material has the same LUMO position of 4.2 eV with the electron transport material (ETL) PCBM, which is more advantageous to the electron transfer. That is also an important reason why MAPb0.75Sn0.25I3 could realize the highest PCE with the inverted structure in our previous report. In this work, a few molecules thick of C60 is wrapped on the perovskite grain and inserted between PCBM and perovskite. In consideration of the fact that C60 has a deeper LUMO than the perovskite material and PCBM (as shown in the energy band diagram), the electron would not be favorably transported from C60 to PCBM due to the barrier presence if the C60 interlayer is too thick. The C60 doping concentration in this work appears to be small enough to form the C60 package tunneling layer.

The hybrid Sn–Pb perovskite solar cells tend to be important in overcoming the toxicity issue due to its competitive efficiency in comparison to the pure lead perovskite solar cells. However, the worse chemical stability is still a restricting factor with respect to the moisture and oxygen, which are thought to be the main factors in the decomposition of hybrid Sn–Pb perovskite solar cells when exposed to the ambient atmosphere. Particularly, the reasons are included as follows: (i) the inherent bibulous and diffluent character of the organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite absorbing layer; (ii) the hole transport layer (HTL) PEDOT:PSS shows a strong acidity after absorbing water;45 (iii) the existing form of Sn2+ is easily oxidized to Sn4+ upon contact with oxygen.19 Thus, it is necessary to prevent the damage from moisture and oxygen to ensure high efficiency and stability of hybrid Sn–Pb perovskite solar cells. We have monitored the stability of the MAPb0.75Sn0.25I3 hybrid perovskite absorption layer with and without C60 additive. These two devices are exposed directly to the ambient environment (the temperature is in the range of 20–25 °C, and humidity is in the range of 30–50%) without encapsulation. Cell parameters were normalized to the values obtained after device preparation (0 day). Values represented are average values of 6 devices, and error bars indicate the standard deviation. As shown in Fig. 5a, the PCE of C60-additive devices are demonstrated to be decayed with, the value of only 20%, whereas the control devices exhibited a dramatic drop in efficiency of up to 60% within 7 days. Other parameters (Jsc, Voc, FF) are shown in Fig. 5b, c and d, respectively. The results indicated that the main cause of the stability enhancement of PCE when using C60 additive are attributed to the steady Jsc and FF, which are closely related to the charge extraction and transmission through the bulk and interface of perovskite thin films.

To elucidate the mechanism of improvement of chemical stability after adding C60, we introduce a scheme of inverted planar hybrid Sn–Pb perovskite solar cell, as shown in Fig. 6a. C60 is homogeneously distributed at grain boundaries throughout the perovskite layer, with a few molecules thick. It is well accepted that C60 has a low solubility in water (<10−9 mg L−1)46 and almost no oxidation at room temperature.47 Thus, the C60 distributed at grain boundaries throughout the perovskite layer serves as an isolating layer that is effective against moisture and oxygen in air. Fig. 6b shows the water contact angle increase from 94.8° to 103.5° after the introduction of C60. As we all know, the organic–inorganic perovskite materials are hydroscopic, and easily dissolved in water. In this regard, the introduction of C60 distributed at the grain boundaries functions as a raincoat to prevent moisture permeation. The degradation of perovskite caused by moisture has been widely studied, revealing the main final products of the decomposition as PbI2 and I2, which would cause the peak of to PbI2 gradually increase.24Fig. 6c shows the X-ray diffraction patterns of these two films after exposure to ambient atmosphere for five days. The X-ray diffraction patterns of these two films after preparation are shown in Fig. S6.† Obviously, the PbI2 peak increased for the control one, and remained unchanged for the one with C60 additive after exposure to air. This could be explained by the C60 additive separating the perovskite grain from moisture. Additionally, the XPS spectrums of these two films after exposure to air for five days are shown in Fig. 6d. The peak assigned to Sn element was fitted into two main peaks; the corresponding peaks of 486.3 eV and 487.3 eV are associated with Sn2+ and Sn4+, respectively. The ratio of Sn4+ to Sn2+ was reduced from 1.33 to 1.25 after C60 additive, indicating that C60 additive could also prevent perovskite grain from oxidation. Although the encapsulation technology can work to protect the solar cell device from ambient environment, the in situ modification by C60 additive not only protects perovskite (especially the hybrid Sn–Pb perovskite) from degradation, but also improves the bulk and interface recombination lifetimes, which are favorable to effectively enhance the efficiency and reduce the hysteresis effect.

Conclusions
In this work, we employed a slight C60 doping technique to prepare MAPb0.75Sn0.25I3 hybrid Sn–Pb perovskite films. The presence of binding energy between C60 and DMSO molecules is expected to tune the crystallization process of perovskites, which gives rise to the formation of perovskite thin film with decreased pinholes and uniformed distribution of C60 at the gain boundary. The perovskite–C60 hybrid solar cells demonstrated higher efficiency, less hysteresis effects and higher long-term stability. The excellent performance is mainly associated with the C60 interfacial passivation effects, which increased the bulk and surface recombination lifetimes and decreased the charge trap-state density. Besides, the improved stability of the hybrid Sn–Pb perovskite is also ascribed to the prevention of moisture and oxygen penetration from ambient atmosphere by the C60 additive. This work provides a facile approach to prepare high-efficiency, stable hybrid Sn–Pb perovskite solar cells toward commercial applications.
