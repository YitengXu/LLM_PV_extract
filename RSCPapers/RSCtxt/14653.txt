    , Accepted 24th July 2018First published on 25th July 2018AbstractRE-doped (Yb3+, Er3+ and Tm3+) nano-glass-ceramics (nGCs) comprising BaGdF5 nanocrystals have been developed under thermal treatment of precursor sol–gel glasses. Structural analysis by means of X-ray diffraction patterns, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy images, and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy measurements, confirmed the precipitation and distribution of cubic BaGdF5 nanocrystals (around 10 nm in size) in the silica glass matrix. Under near-IR excitation at 980 nm, up-conversion (UC) emissions have been studied as a function of selected dopants, the doping level and the pump power. In addition to the characteristic NIR, vis and UV UC emissions of Er3+ and Tm3+ dopant ions, the studied nGCs present intense UV UC emissions of the host fluoride nanocrystal, Gd3+. It was also observed that the relative Yb3+ content tended to improve the UC emission intensities. Corresponding UC mechanisms and energy transfer processes were analysed in terms of their energy level diagrams and confirmed by transient emission and pump power measurements. Moreover, power dependence analysis revealed that these emissions present saturation effects with the increase of Yb3+ content, even at low pump power. Results suggest that these high-efficiency UC nGCs have potential applications in UV solid state laser materials, solid state lighting and photovoltaics.
1. Introduction
Up-conversion (UC) is an anti-Stokes process where multiple absorption of low-energy photons occurs via intermediate long-lived energy states followed by the emission of high-energy photons. In the last decades, UC from NIR to UV-vis-NIR in nanomaterials doped with rare-earth (RE3+) ions has received increasing attention due to their potential applications such as 3D displays, UV and visible solid state lasers, white LEDs, anti-counterfeiting, thermometry, photovoltaics and biological labelling, among others.1–7 Many of these applications have been developed by using fluorides, taking advantage of their low-phonon energy and high quantum efficiencies as luminescent hosts.8 In this sense, increasing attention has been paid to transparent oxyfluoride nano-glass-ceramics (nGCs), which comprise fluoride nanocrystals (NCs) embedded into a robust oxide glassy matrix, as the easy incorporation of RE3+ ions into fluoride nanocrystalline environments enhances the luminescent features.9–15
Among RE3+ ions, Yb3+–Tm3+ and Yb3+–Er3+ ions are well-known UC systems, where Tm3+ and Er3+ ions are able to convert NIR into vis (mainly blue, green and red) and UV photons by sequential excitation from the ground to different excited levels. Moreover, the intensity of these emissions can be efficiently enhanced when co-doping with Yb3+ ions, due to their larger absorption cross-section at 980 nm (2F7/2 → 2F5/2) and the highly efficient energy transfer (ET) process from Yb3+ to Tm3+ and Er3+ ions.16 In this sense, D. Chen et al. obtained intense UV-blue UC emissions in nGCs comprising Yb3+–Tm3+:YF3 NCs,7 while J. K. Cao et al. and D. Chen et al. studied the temperature-sensing UC properties in oxyfluoride nGCs containing Yb3+–Er3+:K3LuF6 and Yb3+/Er3+/Tm3+:YF3 NCs, respectively17,18 (all prepared by the conventional melt-quenching method). Our group has also reported UC luminescent studies of Yb3+/Er3+/Tm3+ co-doped-nGCs containing different fluoride NCs such as YF3,19 LaF3,20 NaYF4,21 KYF422 and Sr2LuF7.23 All nGCs were prepared by the sol–gel technique, with advantages such as its simplicity, low cost and precise control of the final composition when compared with melting methods.24
Recently, we have also studied the bright luminescence in nGCs comprising BaGdF5 NCs, where the ET from Gd3+ to different RE3+ ions was evidenced.25 This ET where Gd3+ ions act as a sensitizer to RE3+ ions, was also previously reported by other researchers in glasses, NCs and nGCs.26–30 Compared to other fluorides, BaGdF5 (a phonon energy of 457 cm−1)31 can be also considered an excellent host matrix for UC processes.31–36 In particular, as reported by D. Yang et al.,37 the UC luminescence intensity of active-core/active-shell (BaGdF5:Yb3+–Er3+/BaGdF5:Yb3+) nanoparticles was much higher than that of β-NaYF4:Yb3+–Er3+ nanoparticles with a similar particle size and the same doping concentration. In the majority of these studies,31–37 observed UC emissions, ascribed to dopant ions, were in the visible range, while only one recent study also reports high energy emissions in the UV range,36 manipulating UC emissions by co-doping with Ce3+ ions. In that respect, Gd3+ ions can also give rise to UV UC emissions despite presenting an energy gap of ∼32000 cm−1 between the first excited level 6P7/2 and the ground state. Thus, deep UV UC emissions of Gd3+ ions acting as an activator were observed in Yb3+–Tm3+–Gd3+:YF3,38 Yb3+–Tm3+–Gd3+:NaYF4,39,40 Yb3+–Tm3+:GdF341 and Yb3+–Er3+:NaGdF4 NCs.42 However, these Gd3+ ion UV UC emissions have not been previously reported in BaGdF5.
In this work we present, for the first time, sol–gel derived Yb3+–Er3+–Tm3+ co-doped nGCs containing cubic BaGdF5 NCs. Under 980 nm excitation, tuneable NIR, vis and UV UC luminescence was observed and analysed by changing the selected dopants, the doping level and the pump power. Moreover, UV UC emissions of host fluoride NC Gd3+ were observed for the very first time in this nGC system, where Yb3+–Er3+ and Yb3+–Tm3+ acted as double sensitizers. The UC mechanisms and ET processes were elucidated in detail through pump power dependence and transient luminescence measurements, taking saturation effects into account.
2. Results and discussion
The crystal structure and phase purity of the precipitated NCs in the obtained nGCs were examined by XRD. Fig. 1 presents XRD patterns of the nGCs with composition 95SiO2–5BaGd(0.98−x)YbxEr0.02F5 (in mol%), where x = 0, 0.06, 0.1 or 0.2. In all cases, superposed on the broad diffraction band around 22°, which corresponds to amorphous SiO2 (see XRD of the precursor glass also included in Fig. 1), it can be seen prominent diffraction peaks well consistent with the standard card JCPDS 24-0098 (also included in Fig. 1) of cubic phase BaGdF5. By using the strongest peak at around 2θ = 25.8°, and the Scherrer equation, the calculated mean NC size is around 10 nm for all nGCs. This value is comparable to those obtained by K. Biswas et al.43 (around 12 nm) and P. Karmakar et al.44 (around 8–12 nm), and relatively smaller than those obtained by W. Zhang et al.45 (around 10–20 nm), Q. Wang et al.30 (around 13–28 nm) and S. Huang et al.46 (around 18–27 nm) in BaGdF5 nGCs. In that respect, it is worth mentioning that the obtained nGCs present a high degree of transparency, as can be seen in the inset of Fig. 1, due to the fact that precipitated NC sizes are smaller than the wavelength of visible light, which is very important for their practical applications. The intense absorption peak at around 1 μm can be ascribed to the transition 2F7/2 → 2F5/2 of Yb3+ ions. The XRD patterns of nGCs doped with Yb3+–Tm3+ (not shown) also present similar characteristics, i.e., location, relative intensity and broadness of the XRD peaks.

An XRD pattern of the sol–gel precursor glass and standard peaks of BaGdF5 (JCPDS 24-0098) are also included for comparison. The inset shows the transmittance curve of the 95SiO2–5BaGd0.78Yb0.2Er0.02F5 co-doped nGC. 
On the other hand, it should be noted that no variation related to the crystalline phase when increasing the Yb3+ concentration was observed. However, a shift of diffraction peaks towards higher values of 2θ is observed after Yb3+ and Er3+ doping. This fact may be related to the smaller values of the ionic radii for Yb3+ and Er3+ ions (rYb3+ = 0.985 Å and rEr3+ = 1.004 Å) in comparison with Gd3+ ions (rGd3+ = 1.053 Å). This implies that dopant ions are successfully incorporated into the crystal lattice of the BaGdF5 host substituting the Gd3+ sites. In this sense, by using the FullProf software,47 the experimentally calculated cell parameters are included in Table 1 for different Yb3+–Er3+ doping levels. The obtained values are consistent with the expected decreased crystal cell and, in all cases, such values are comparable with those obtained in the undoped BaGdF5 NCs with sizes around 10 nm (5.990 Å).25,48

In order to determine the morphology and structure of nGCs, a TEM bright-field image of the nGC with composition 95SiO2–5BaGd78Yb0.2Er0.02F5 is shown in Fig. 2(a). Roughly spherical NCs (with dark appearance) were observed homogeneously distributed throughout the glassy matrix. The NC size (about 10 nm), as confirmed by the crystal size distribution shown in the inset, is in line with those estimated by the Scherrer equation from the XRD patterns. Fig. 2(b) shows a high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image of several precipitated BaGdF5 NCs, where the lattice fringes are clearly observed showing the highly crystalline nature of the nanocrystalline environments. The power spectrum corresponding to the FFT pattern obtained from the white circled NC is also presented in Fig. 2(c), as well as a higher contrast image. The distance between the lattice fringes (d-spacing) was measured to be 3.37 Å, which turns out to be in good agreement with the expected lattice spacing value for the (111) plane of the BaGdF5 cubic phase by using the Bragg equation. Fig. 2(d) presents further EDS analysis of an area containing a glassy matrix with several BaGdF5 NCs. The presence of intense peaks confirms that the major constituents of the embedded NCs are Ba, Gd, F and Yb. Si and O peaks are also present due to the silica matrix, along with Cu and C peaks from the carbon and copper grid.

Next, the luminescent features of Yb3+–Er3+–Tm3+ co-doped nGCs were analysed as a function of selected dopants, the doping concentration and the excitation pump power. In this sense, energy level diagrams of Yb3+–Er3+–Tm3+ and also Gd3+ ions are presented in Fig. 3, where UC emissions and proposed ET and cross-relaxation (CR) mechanisms are depicted.

UC emission spectra of 95SiO2–5BaGd(0.98−x)YbxEr0.02F5 nGCs (where x = 0, 0.06, 0.1 or 0.2), exciting at 980 nm at 300 mW, are shown in Fig. 4(a), where transitions are labelled according to the energy level diagrams of Fig. 3. All nGCs show dominant green (520–540 nm) and red (660 nm) emission bands, corresponding to transitions from 4S3/2(2H11/2) and 4F9/2 excited levels to the 4I15/2 ground level of Er3+ ions, respectively. These UC emissions bands were very weak for the Er3+ single-doped nGC (see magnification Fig. 4(a)), but much more intense (even observable by the naked eye) for the Yb3+–Er3+ co-doped nGCs. Moreover, by increasing the Yb3+ concentration, the intensity of all UC emission bands increased drastically, particularly those of the UV-violet range. The red (R) to green (G) UC band intensity ratio went up from 0.15 to 0.83 (see the left inset in Fig. 4(a)) which could be useful in tuneable UC phosphors. This behaviour has also been previously observed in other Yb3+–Er3+ co-doped systems, such as Y2O3, NaREF4(RE = Y, Lu), Ba5Gd8Zn4O21 and Na5Lu9F32.49–52 Moreover, compared with the direct excitation spectrum at λexc = 485 nm (4I15/2 → 4F7/2) for the 95SiO2–5BaGd0.78Yb0.2Er0.02F5 nGC (see the right inset in Fig. 4(a)) an enhancement of the R to G ratio (from 0.33 to 0.83) is also observed (see the left inset in Fig. 4(a)). This change is associated with additional population mechanisms for the 4F9/2 level in the UC process, absent in direct excitation, as will be shown later. Additionally, it should be remarked that both emissions present well-resolved Stark components, similar to those previously observed by C. Xu et al.32 and D. Yang et al.37 for BaGdF5 nanoparticles. This suggests an important incorporation of RE3+ ions into the precipitated BaGdF5 NCs, according to the XRD and EDS results previously discussed. Regarding UV-violet UC emissions, those observed at 318, 378 and 408 nm, correspond to transitions from 2P3/2, 4G11/2 and 2H9/2 levels to the 4I15/2 level of Er3+ ions, respectively. The higher energy UV emissions at 276 and 311 nm (see the magnification in Fig. 4(a)), are assigned to transitions from 6IJ and 6PJ levels to the 8S7/2 ground level of Gd3+ ions, respectively. It should be noted that these UV UC emissions of Gd3+ ions have not been previously reported, as far as we know, in BaGdF5 nGCs.

Insets show the red to green emission ratios (left) and the emission spectrum (right) of the 95SiO2–5BaGd0.78Yb0.2Er0.02F5 co-doped nGC, exciting at 485 nm. (b) Corresponding temporal evolution of green (4S3/2) and red (4F9/2) level populations of Er3+ ions, under excitation with a 6 ns pulsed laser at 980 nm from an OPO. 
Finally, for the Yb3+–Er3+ co-doped nGCs, other weaker UC emissions were also observed. Thus, the NIR emission at 810 nm and the blue one at 485 nm are assigned to the transitions from 4I9/2 and 4F7/2 excited levels to the 4I15/2 ground level of Er3+ ions, respectively. The presence of the 4F7/2 → 4I15/2 transition (the energy gap between 4F7/2 and the next lower level, 2H11/2, is about 1000 cm−1) should be highlighted. That would also indicate that dopant ions are preferentially distributed in the BaGdF5 low phonon energy environment in the nGCs.
The proposed UC mechanisms are illustrated in the energy level diagram of Fig. 3. For the single Er3+-doped nGCs, the UC channels can involve excited state absorption (ESA), 4I11/2 + photon → 4F7/2, and the CR process between two Er3+ ions, 4I11/2 + 4I11/2 → 4F7/2 + 4I15/2, by 2-photon processes. From the 4F7/2 level, the mixed 4S3/2(2H11/2) and the 4F9/2 levels can be populated by means of consecutive non-radiative relaxation processes (NR) from these levels, giving rise to the weak green and much weaker red emissions, respectively.
On the other hand, for the Yb3+–Er3+ co-doped nGCs, the transition Yb3+:2F7/2 → 2F5/2 is completely resonant at 980 nm and presents a larger absorption cross-section than the transition Er3+:4I15/2 → 4I11/2 at this wavelength. Thus, when Yb3+–Er3+ co-doped BaGdF5 NCs are excited with a 980 nm laser beam, Yb3+ ions absorb most energy and, through well-known ET mechanisms between Yb3+ and Er3+ and subsequent UC and NR processes, populate the 4F7/2 and 4S3/2(2H11/2) excited levels (485 blue and 520–540 nm green emissions) of Er3+ by 2-photon processes, the 4G11/2 and 2H9/2 levels (378 and 408 nm violet emissions) by 3-photon processes,53,54 and the 2P3/2 level (318 nm UV emission) by 4-photon processes (see energy levels in Fig. 3). Furthermore, under 980 nm excitation, UV UC emissions of Gd3+ ions from 6IJ and 6PJ levels (276 and 311 nm) can also be obtained, despite the large energy gap of 32100 cm−1 between the first excited level 6P7/2 and the 8S7/2 ground state. This is due to very efficient ET mechanisms from Er3+ to Gd3+ ions: (Er3+:4G9/2 + Gd3+:8S7/2 → Er3+:4I15/2 + Gd3+:6IJ) and (Er3+:4G7/2–2K13/2 + Gd3+:8S7/2 → Er3+:4I15/2 + Gd3+:6PJ) by 4-photon processes.
Regarding the red emission low intensity, after direct excitation to the 4F7/2 level (at 485 nm) for the nGC with composition 95SiO2–5BaGd0.78Yb0.2Er0.02F5 (see the right inset in Fig. 4(a)), this emission requires relaxation from the mixed 4S3/2(2H11/2) levels to the emitting 4F9/2 level (see Fig. 3). This transition has a very low probability. The NR rate is low due to a large energy gap of 2960 cm−1 (BaGdF5 phonon energy of 457 cm−1), and the radiative rate is also negligible. On the other hand, two mechanisms are generally accepted for the red UC emission from the 4F9/2 level in Yb3+–Er3+ co-doped materials: the above NR from the 4S3/2(2H11/2) upper level, and the NR from the 4I11/2 to the 4I13/2 level followed by an ESA process (Er3+:4I13/2 + photon → Er3+:4F9/2) or even by an ET process between Yb3+ and Er3+ ions (Yb3+:2F5/2 + Er3+:4I13/2 → Yb3+:2F7/2 + Er3+:4F9/2). This last mechanism should also be restricted due to the large energy gap of about 3700 cm−1 between the 4I11/2 and 4I13/2 levels. On the other hand, the 4F9/2 level can also be fed by an alternative mechanism,49,52,55 less studied than the previous ones, which consists of CR between two Er3+ ions (Er3+:4F7/2 + Er3+:4I11/2 → 2Er3+:4F9/2), with processes that involve similar energy gaps (see Fig. 3). Thus, when the Yb3+ doping level is low (e.g., single 2% Er3+-doped or 6% Yb3+–2% Er3+ co-doped nGCs), the 4F7/2 and 4I11/2 levels will not be sufficiently populated and the green emissions predominate.
However, when the Yb3+ concentration is higher (10 and 20%), the ET from Yb3+ to Er3+ ions could be greatly increased and more Er3+ ions would reach the 4F7/2 and 4I11/2 levels, yielding an increase of the red emission over the green one (see Fig. 4(a)).50,51 This last assumption is supported by measurements of the transient evolution of the luminescence corresponding to 4S3/2 and 4F9/2 levels, under 6 ns pulsed 980 nm excitation (OPO) in the 20% Yb3+–2% Er3+ co-doped nGC (see Fig. 4(b)). It shows how at the end of the excitation pulse (t ∼ 0), no luminescence intensity is observed in any case, and next, the transient presents a delayed rise and a decay of luminescence, showing that an ET process from Yb3+ to Er3+ ions takes place. Moreover, the 4F9/2 level is built up less than the 4S3/2 level, confirming the proposed CR mechanism, which requires additional time after ET from Yb3+ to Er3+ ions. Experimental intensity data can be adjusted to56I(t) = A·(1 − e−t/τr)·e−t/τrd,were A is an emission intensity factor, and τr and τd represent rise and decay times of luminescence, respectively, giving rise to rise and decay time values of τr = 61 and τd = 316 μs, and τr = 187 and τd = 603 μs for 4S3/2 and 4F9/2 levels, respectively. These values are comparable to those obtained by T. Grzyb et al. for Yb3+–Er3+ co-doped BaGdF5 NCs,33 I. Etchard et al. for Yb3+–Er3+ co-doped Ln2BaZnO5 phosphors56 and S. Liu et al.57 for Yb3+–Er3+ co-doped GdF3 nanocrystals in a glass matrix.

Fig. 5(a) shows the UC emission spectra of 95SiO2–5BaGd(0.98−y)YbyTm0.02F5 co-doped nGCs, where y = 0.06, 0.1 or 0.2, exciting at 980 nm at 300 mW. Intense and bright UC emissions in the UV-vis-NIR range are achieved. A dominant blue emission band (480 nm), strong enough to be seen by the naked eye, along with red (650 nm) and NIR (800 nm) weaker bands are observed. These are assigned to the transitions 1G4 → 3H6, 1G4 → 3F4 and 3H4 → 3H6 of Tm3+ ions, respectively, according to the energy level diagram of Fig. 3.

(b) Corresponding temporal evolution of the blue and red (1G4) level population of Tm3+ ions, under excitation with a 6 ns pulsed laser at 980 nm from an OPO. 
Additionally, emissions coming from 1D2 (360 and 450 nm), 1I6 (290 and 350 nm) and 3P2 (265 nm) levels of Tm3+ ions, located in the UV-blue range, can also be observed along with higher energy UV emissions at 253, 276 and 311 nm, corresponding to 6D9/2 → 8S7/2, 6IJ → 8S7/2 and 6PJ → 8S7/2 transitions of Gd3+ ions, respectively. An increase in these UC intensities when increasing the Yb3+ content was observed, which was also more noticeable for the higher energy emissions, the same as Yb3+–Er3+ co-doped nGCs.
The UC and ET mechanisms depicted in the energy level diagrams of Fig. 3 for the UV, vis and NIR emissions can be described as follows: when Yb3+–Tm3+ co-doped nGCs are pumped by a 980 nm laser beam, only Yb3+ ions are excited efficiently due to their high absorption cross-section at this wavelength. Next, efficient ET processes from Yb3+:2F5/2 to Tm3+ ions and NR populate 3H5, 3F2,3 and 1G4 levels, involving 1, 2 and 3 photons, respectively, and giving rise to 800 nm NIR, 650 nm red and 480 nm blue emissions. In this regard, for the 20% Yb3+–2% Tm3+ co-doped nGC, red and blue emissions show a delayed rise and a decay after the end of 6 ns pulsed excitation at 980 nm, see Fig. 5(b), which supports the proposed ET mechanism. Additionally, similar rise and decay times for red and blue emissions were calculated (τr = 157; τd = 812 μs), further confirming that both emissions involve a similar ET mechanism. These values are comparable to those obtained by T. Grzyb et al. for Yb3+–Tm3+ co-doped BaGdF5 NCs.33 The 1D2 level of Tm3+ (360 nm UV and 450 nm blue emissions) cannot be populated directly by ET from Yb3+:2F5/2, due to a large energy mismatch of about 3500 cm−1 between Yb3+:2F5/2 → 2F7/2 and Tm3+:1G4 → 1D2. Instead, the CR processes 3F2,3 + 3H4 → 3H6 + 1D2 among Tm3+ ions may populate the Tm3+:1D2 level by a 4-photon UC process.58,59 Then, the 3P2 level can be populated by direct ET from Yb3+ ions (Yb3+:2F5/2 + Tm3+:1D2 → Yb3+:2F7/2 + Tm3+:3P2) implying five 980 nm photons. From the 3P2 level, some Tm3+ ions can produce a radiative transition (265 nm UV emission, see the inset in Fig. 5(a)), others can decay through NR to the 1I6 level (290 and 350 nm UV emissions), and the rest can transfer energy to the 6IJ levels of Gd3+ ions (Tm3+:3P2 + Gd3+:8S7/2 → Tm3+:3H6 + Gd3+:6IJ). From this level, Gd3+ ions can emit to the 8S7/2 ground state (276 nm UV emission) or, by means of NR, go down to the 6PJ levels (311 nm UV emission). The longer time required to populate the 6PJ level of Gd3+ ions (see the inset in Fig. 5(b)) in comparison with the blue and red emitting level of Tm3+ ions confirms an ET process from Tm3+ to Gd3+ ions. Finally, the 6D9/2 level of Gd3+ ions, from which 253 nm UV emission is obtained, can be populated by ESA processes, by CR between Gd3+ ions or, more likely, by another ET from Yb3+ to Gd3+ ions (see Fig. 3).
It should be highlighted that the lifetime (around 7.90 ms) obtained for 311 nm Gd3+ UV UC emission (see the inset in Fig. 5(b)) is longer than any UC emission observed, making Gd3+ suitable for UV laser applications. The obtained value is considerably longer than the one previously reported for NaYF4 particles by M. Pokhrel et al.60 and NaYbF4 nanoparticles by X. Chen et al.,61 at 2.73 and 4.07 ms, respectively.
Next, to further confirm the mechanisms that populate the emitting levels of Er3+, Tm3+ and Gd3+ ions, the UC intensity dependence as a function of pump power was studied. It is known that, for an unsaturated UC process, the number of required photons to feed an emitting level can be obtained from the slope of the log–log plot of intensity versus pump power. In this regime, the UC luminescence intensity I is proportional to the power n of infrared exciting pump power P, I ∝ Pn, where n is the number of IR photons absorbed per up-conversion photon emitted.62 Thus, all the above proposed UC and ET mechanisms are in good agreement with the calculated slopes for different emissions observed in nGCs with low Yb3+ content (see Fig. 6 and Table 2). However, this relation is not valid in a high excitation power regime. When the UC processes are dominant, the power dependence does not follow the above straightforward relation and the obtained slopes (n) will deviate from the expected values.62,63 This effect can be related to the established competition between linear decay and UC processes for the depletion of the intermediate excited levels.62,64 In the present study, the saturation effect can also be related to the relative content of Yb3+ ions to Er3+ or Tm3+ ions.40,65 Thus, in all cases, as the content of Yb3+ ions increased, the corresponding slope value is reduced from the theoretical value, increasing the efficiency of the UC processes42 (see Fig. 6 and Table 2).

Finally, to quantify the overall emitted colour for the studied nGCs, we can use the CIE standard chromaticity diagram,66 where the total visible emission can be represented by a point. Thus, any colour can be expressed in terms of a unique (x; y) colour coordinate that corresponds to the chromaticity, seen by the naked eye, after a correction for sensitive receptors of the eye. Fig. 7 shows colour coordinates of the 0.2Yb3+–0.02Tm3+ co-doped nGC (0.18; 0.11) and the 0.2Yb3+–0.02Er3+ co-doped nGC (0.32; 0.65). Thus, the overall colours emitted are located in the violet–blue and green ranges of the CIE diagram, respectively. Additionally, finer colour tuneability can be obtained by varying the Yb3+ content in the Yb3+–Er3+ and Yb3+–Tm3+ co-doped nGCs (see Fig. 7).

3. Experimental
Silica glasses with composition 95SiO2–5BaGd(0.98−x)YbxEr0.02F5 and 95SiO2–5BaGd(0.98−y)YbyTm0.02F5 (in mol%), where x = 0, 0.06, 0.1 or 0.2 and y = 0.06, 0.1 or 0.2, were obtained by sol–gel method in a similar way as the one described in ref. 53. Tetraethoxysilane (TEOS, 99.999% Aldrich) Si(OCH2CH3)4 (used as a source of SiO2) was hydrolysed for 1 h at room temperature with a mixed solution of ethanol and deionized H2O, using acetic acid as the catalyst. The molar ratio of TEOS:ethanol:H2O:CH3COOH was 1:4:10:0.5. The required quantities of Ba(CH3COO)2 (99.999% Aldrich), Gd(CH3COO)3·xH2O, Yb(CH3COO)3·xH2O, Er(CH3COO)3·xH2O and Tm(CH3COO)3·xH2O (99.9% Aldrich) were dissolved in a CF3COOH and H2O solution, and slowly mixed with the initial solution. The molar ratio of metal ions to CF3COOH was 1:5. In order to make the solution homogeneous, it was stirred vigorously for 1 h at room temperature. A highly transparent gel was obtained by leaving the resulting homogeneous solution in a sealed container at 35 °C for several days. The gels were then dried by slow evaporation for approximately four weeks to remove any residual water and solvents, giving rise to the “xerogels”. Finally, these xerogels were heat-treated in an air atmosphere at 650 °C, the optimal temperature to achieve a stiff glass network and the controlled precipitation of BaGdF5 NCs required to produce transparent nGCs.
Powder X-ray diffraction patterns (XRD) of the samples were recorded with a Philips Panalytical X’Pert Pro diffractometer equipped with a primary monochromator, a Cu Kα1α2 radiation source, and an X’Celerator detector. The XRD patterns were collected with a step of 0.016° in the 2θ angular range from 15–90° and an acquisition time of 30 min. Furthermore, the diffraction pattern of LaB6 was used as an internal standard to calibrate the parameters of the instrumental profile. TEM-HRTEM and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) were performed by using a JEOL 2010F microscope operating at 200 kV and equipped with a field emission gun, which allowed us to achieve a point-to-point resolution of 0.19 nm. Specimens were prepared by dispersing fine powders, obtained by grinding the samples, in acetone and dropping them onto carbon-coated copper grids. Selected areas of the HRTEM images were mathematically filtered by means of Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) analysis, resulting in power spectra patterns corresponding to the eigen-frequencies of the observed NCs. Furthermore, the relevant frequencies were selected in order to filter the noise in the zoomed areas of the HRTEM images, and to produce higher contrast images of the atomic planes of the observed NCs.
The transmittance of nGCs was measured by means of a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 9 ultraviolet–visible–infrared (UV-vis-IR) spectrophotometer with a resolution of 0.5 nm. UC measurements were carried out with a laser diode at 980 nm with a pump power up to 300 mW. A rough estimation of the power density can be derived from the incident laser excitation pump power, the beam diameter (2 mm) and the 50 mm focal length of the lens for concentrating incident radiation onto the samples. Detection was done through a 0.2 m monochromator equipped with a R928 photomultiplier. The emission rise and decay times were measured using a tunable optical parametric oscillator (OPO) (EKSPLA NT342) pumped by the third harmonic wavelength at 355 nm of a Q-switched YAG:Nd laser, tuned to 980 nm in order to excite the studied samples with a pulse duration of 6 ns and a repetition frequency of 10 Hz. Detection was carried out using a R928 photomultiplier and a digital oscilloscope (Keysight DSOX 2024A). For the steady state measurements, samples were excited with light from a 75 W Xe arc lamp whose beam was directed through a 0.2 m monochromator and detected with a 0.2 m monochromator with a R928 photomultiplier. All spectra were collected at room temperature and corrected by the instrumental response. A CCD digital camera was used to take color pictures of luminescence emitted by the samples.
4. Conclusions
RE (Yb3+, Er3+ and Tm3+)-doped nGCs containing BaGdF5 NCs were obtained from thermal treatment of precursor sol–gel glasses. XRD, HRTEM and EDS measurements confirmed the precipitation of cubic BaGdF5 NCs in the silica glass matrix. Intense and well-resolved NIR, visible and UV UC emissions coming from Er3+ and Tm3+ ions and host fluoride NC Gd3+ confirm the distribution of dopant ions in the BaGdF5 nanocrystalline environment. In these UC emissions, the Yb3+ ions preferentially absorb the 980 nm laser beam photons and efficiently transfer energy to the Er3+ or Tm3+ ions, resulting in their respective UC emissions. Additional ET occurred subsequently from Er3+ or Tm3+ to the Gd3+ ions, giving rise to the UV UC emissions of host fluoride NC Gd3+. Moreover, transient luminescence measurements supported the proposed model for UC and ET mechanisms. An increase in UC intensities when increasing the Yb3+ content was observed, which was more noticeable for the higher energy emissions. Power dependence analysis showed that these UC emissions present saturation effects also related to the increase of Yb3+ content. The overall emitting colour can be modified, from the violet–blue to green ranges of the CIE diagram, by changing the selected dopants, suggesting that these nGCs can be considered for the potential development of UV solid state laser materials, solid state lighting and photovoltaic solar cells.
