    , Accepted 22nd May 2017First published on 23rd May 2017AbstractWe synthesized the conjugated polymers PT2OBT, PVT2OBT, and PFBT2OBT for use in organic photodetecting devices. An octyloxy benzothiadiazole (OBT) moiety was used as a weak electron-accepting building block in the polymer system to cause the dominant absorption in the green-light region via weakening the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) interactions between adjacent electron-donating moieties. In particular, indirect X-ray detection using a scintillator requires a low leakage current; thus, we focused on designing a molecular structure that can enhance the detectivity. The difluorobenzene-incorporated PFBT2OBT polymer showed a strong edge-on orientation both in the pristine film and in the blend film; however, PT2OBT and PVT2OBT have no preferred molecular orientation in the blend film. In the edge-on structure, the alkyl side chains of PFBT2OBT align on the surface of the electrode, forming an insulating layer, which decreases the tunneling leakage current, whereas in the latter cases, the interface between the semiconducting polymer backbone and PC70BM can come into contact with the electrode, forming a pathway for the leakage current. Consequently, the PFBT2OBT:PC70BM devices showed promising detectivities of over 1013 Jones over a wide range of reverse biases of up to −2 V, resulting from their low dark current density of less than 2.3 × 10−9 A cm−2.
Introduction
Printed electronic sensors have gained much attention as inexpensive and fully flexible devices because they can be fabricated using the cost-saving roll-to-roll printing technique and room-temperature processes on flexible plastic or paper substrates.1–6 Currently, various types of applications, such as capacitive,7,8 piezoelectric,9–13 photoelectric,14,15 temperature,16,17 gas sensors,18,19etc., have been considered for printed sensors; among them, photoelectric sensors have been extensively studied in both academia and industry,20,21 and much progress has been made for research into organic photodetectors including molecular engineering and interface engineering.22–24
The photoelectric effect occurs when light is converted to an electric current, similar to the process in the eyes, and the most popular photoelectric devices are CMOS image sensors25,26 and digital X-ray sensors.27 In particular, conventional X-ray sensors using silicon-based photodiodes are usually large-area devices due to optical limitations in concentrating numerous X-ray photons into a small area. Additionally, X-ray detection for medical diagnostics requires highly X-ray transparent devices for shadow-free imaging.28 Therefore, it is essential to develop organic photodiodes with much higher absorption characteristics than silicon-based photodiodes. In addition, for flexible applications, silicon, the most common photoelectric material, must be replaced by solution-processible organic semiconductors29,30 because silicon is fabricated by using a vacuum-deposition process and, in thin films, the photo-absorption of silicon is not as high as that of organic semiconductors owing to the indirect band gap of silicon. The absorption properties of photoactive materials are significantly affected by the “responsivity”, which is directly related to the current density upon light illumination (photo-induced current density, Jph) in photoelectric devices, and thus excellent light absorption characteristics are required for developing organic photoelectric materials.
The other important parameter in photoelectric devices is the “detectivity”, which is defined as the reciprocal of the noise-equivalent power. Thus, to increase the detectivity, the leakage current of the devices should be minimized.28 In particular, for digital X-ray detectors, the detectivity is much more important than the responsivity.29 When X-rays are converted to visible light rays by a scintillator, such as CsI(Tl), the material exhibits an emission maximum of 550 nm with a light output of 54 photons per 1 keV.31 The weak illumination and low current density are great advantages for repeatable use and long-term stability. However, to detect this weak signal from the scintillator, the devices should maintain a low leakage current in order to distinguish the target signal from the noise; thus, high detectivity is required.
To increase the detectivity, several studies have controlled the thickness or morphology of the active layer,15,32–36 added a buffer layer between the electrode and the active layer37–40 and fabricated p–n junction bilayer photodiodes.41,42 However, most of these studies focused on the device structures, rather than the materials.
In this study, we focus on the development of novel organic conjugated polymers to reduce the leakage current and to enhance the sensitivity for solution-processed organic photodetectors. We synthesized three electron-donating polymers, PT2OBT, PVT2OBT, and PFBT2OBT, via the Stille coupling of 4,7-bis(5-bromo-4-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)-5,6-bis(octyloxy)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (2) with 5,5′-bis(trimethylstannyl)-2,2′-bithiophene, or E)-1,2-bis(5-(trimethylstannyl)thiophen-2-yl)ethene or (5,5′-(2,5-difluoro-1,4-phenylene)bis(thiophene-5,2-diyl))bis(trimethylstannane).
First, for the effective detection of photons that passed through the common CsI(Tl) or GOS:Tb scintillator, we designed conjugated polymers with major absorption in the green-light region (500–590 nm). The maximum absorption of donor–acceptor (D–A)-type polymers can be adjusted by controlling the strength of the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) interaction between the two monomers.43 To achieve green-light absorption, ICT interactions in D–A structures must be weakened, which can be efficiently achieved by introducing a weak electron acceptor (WA) in the conjugated backbone of the polymer. We selected the alkoxybenzothiadiazole moiety 4,7-bis(5-bromo-4-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)-5,6-bis(octyloxy)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (2) as the WA unit because the electron-donating alkoxy groups weaken the electron-accepting properties of benzothiadiazole. Second, to increase the responsivity, we introduced bithiophene (T2), vinylene-incorporated T2 (VT2) and difluorobenzene-inserted T2 (FBT2) moieties in the conjugated backbone. These extended π structures promote molecular stacking and charge transfer,44,45 which can increase the responsivity. Third, the molecular orientation of the conjugated polymers is thought to be important to enhance the detectivity. In semiconductors, the leakage current is generated from the tunneling current at the junction of the electron donor and acceptor.46 A face-on dominated orientation can increase the contact area between the conjugated backbone and the electrode due to vertical π–π stacking, which diminishes the insulating properties and increases the leakage current. In contrast, in edge-on dominated structures, the alkyl side chains are angled toward the electrode, spontaneously forming an insulating alkyl layer at the surface of the electrode, which likely decreases the tunneling leakage similar to the treatment of a molecular monolayer between the electrode and the semiconductor.47 Thus, we synthesized conjugated polymers with different molecular orientations and found that, among the synthesized polymers, the polymer that forms edge-on structures has the lowest leakage current and the highest detectivity of 1.02 × 1013 Jones at a bias of −2 V. UV−Vis spectra, space-charge limited current (SCLC) mobility, two-dimensional grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (2D-GIXD) patterns, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were investigated in detail to verify our expectations of the photoelectric properties.
Results and discussion
Synthesis of monomers and polymers
4,7-Bis(4-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)-5,6-bis(octyloxy)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (1) was synthesized by the Stille coupling of 4,7-dibromo-5,6-bis(octyloxy)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole48 and (4-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)trimethylstannane,49 followed by bromination with N-bromosuccinimide in dimethylformamide to give 4,7-bis(5-bromo-4-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)-5,6-bis(octyloxy)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (2). The final monomer 2 was copolymerized with 5,5′-bis(trimethylstannyl)-2,2′-bithiophene,50 or (E)-1,2-bis(5-(trimethylstannyl) thiophen-2-yl)ethene50 or (5,5′-(2,5-difluoro-1,4-phenylene)bis(thiophene-5,2-diyl)) bis(trimethylstannane)45via Stille polymerization to produce PT2OBT, PVT2OBT and PFBT2OBT, respectively. The synthesized polymers were characterized by 1H NMR, elementary analysis (EA) and gel permeation chromatography (GPC), as summarized in the “Experimental section”, and their synthesis is given in Scheme 1.

Optical and electrochemical properties
The absorption spectra of PT2OBT, PVT2OBT, and PFBT2OBT were obtained in chloroform solution and in the film state and are shown in Fig. 1a and summarized in Table 1. PT2OBT, PVT2OBT, and PFBT2OBT exhibited absorption maxima at 540, 551, and 528 nm in solution, respectively, and at 564, 568, and 584 nm in film, respectively. The insertion of a vinylene moiety between the thiophene rings red-shifted the absorption of PVT2OBT compared to that of PT2OBT due to the extended π structure of PVT2OBT. Interestingly, the incorporation of a difluorobenzene unit between the thiophene rings led to strong π–π stacking behavior in both solution and film.51 PFBT2OBT exhibited a clear shoulder absorption in the long-wavelength region, even in solution, which indicates the presence of substantial intramolecular interactions among the polymer chains. In the film state, PFBT2OBT showed a bathochromic shift of 56 nm and a further developed shoulder peak compared to that in solution, implying the presence of efficient intermolecular interactions and ordering.

Importantly, all three polymers possessed the appropriate absorption range of 550–600 nm because the weak electron-accepting OBT moiety weakens ICT interactions between the donor and acceptor in the conjugated polymer. Thus, the OBT moiety is regarded as an excellent conjugated building block to realize green-light absorption.
The energy levels of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) were determined from cyclic voltammetry (CV) and the optical band gap and are given in Fig. 1b and Table 1. The onset oxidation potentials of PT2OBT, PVT2OBT, and PFBT2OBT are 0.58, 0.55, and 0.66 V, respectively, corresponding to the HOMO levels of −5.20, −5.17, and −5.28 eV, respectively. From the optical band gap, the LUMO energy levels of PT2OBT, PVT2OBT, and PFBT2OBT were determined to be −3.35, −3.36, and −3.47 eV, respectively.
The addition of a vinylene or difluorobenzene moiety between two thiophene rings decreased the band gap of the polymers. However, the vinylene unit up-shifted the HOMO energy level of PVT2OBT, whereas the difluorobenzene ring down-shifted the HOMO energy level of PFBT2OBT. Generally, the extension of a conjugated π system reduces the band gap of a polymer, and the HOMO energy level is up-shifted as the electron-donating character of a polymer chain is increased.52 Thus, both vinylene and difluorobenzene effectively extended the conjugation length of the polymer backbone, and the vinylene unit increased the electron-donating characteristics of the polymer, whereas the electron-withdrawing fluorine atoms reduced the electron-donating properties of the polymer.
Photodetecting properties
The photoelectric properties of PT2OBT, PVT2OBT and PFBT2OBT were investigated by fabricating photodiodes with a device structure of indium tin oxide (ITO)/ZnO/polymer:PC70BM/MoO3/Ag. The blending ratio of the p-type polymer to the n-type PC70BM was optimized at 1:1.5 w/w. The J–V characteristics of the devices were studied in photoconductive mode, as shown in Fig. 2 and S11–13,† because a reverse bias reduces the signal response time and increases the signal linearity upon increasing the light intensity. The responsivity and detectivity of the photodetecting devices were obtained from the J–V characteristics as a function of voltage and light intensity and are summarized in Tables 2 and 3.

The responsivity is simply obtained from the output current density divided by the input light power. As shown in Fig. 3a and b, the current density linearly increased with increasing input light intensity, and thus the responsivity of PT2OBT, PVT2OBT, and PFBT2OBT was quite uniform at approximately 0.28, 0.21, and 0.20 A W−1, respectively, at various light intensities. The higher responsivity of PFBT2OBT resulted in much better signal amplification upon light irradiation (Fig. 2f), which indicates that the PFBT2OBT devices were more sensitive to light detection than the PT2OBT and PVT2OBT devices (Fig. 2d and e). As a function of reverse bias (Fig. 2d–f), the current density gradually increased as the voltage increased. PT2OBT and PVT2OBT showed quite sharp increases in current density (Fig. 2d and e), resulting in a variation in the responsivity of PT2OBT- and PVT2OBT-based devices with reverse bias (Fig. 3c), whereas PFBT2OBT showed quite uniform current density (Fig. 2f) and responsivity upon the change in bias (Fig. 3c). As a result, PFBT2OBT exhibited highly stable responsivity as a function of both light intensity and driving voltage, which is beneficial for obtaining uniform signal detection.

The detectivity is correlated with the responsivity and dark current density (Jd), as shown in eqn (1) and (2).40 The responsivity has a maximum limit because it cannot exceed the ideal responsivity value, which is calculated assuming 100% external quantum efficiency. Thus, the best way to increase the detectivity is to minimize the dark current. As shown in Fig. 2a, b, and c, PT2OBT, PVT2OBT, and PFBT2OBT have dark current densities on the order of 10−6, 10−7, and 10−9 A cm−2, respectively, at reverse biases between −1 V and −2 V. Under the weak illumination at 55.6 μW cm−2, the on/off ratios of the current density of PT2OBT, PVT2OBT, and PFBT2OBT at −2 V were calculated to be 3.85, 71.3, and 5910, respectively, and at the stronger light intensity of 5.44 mW cm−2, the values reached 3.7 × 102, 6.7 × 103, and 5.5 × 106, respectively. As a result, the lowest level of dark current in the PFBT2OBT devices led to a promising on/off ratio for photodetection. The detectivity was calculated from the responsivity and dark current density, and the results are summarized in Tables 2 and 3 and are shown in Fig. 3d. The highest responsivity and the lowest dark current density of the PFBT2OBT devices led to the best detectivity at all driving voltages. PFBT2OBT exhibited a detectivity of over 1013 Jones and maintained a constant value upon changes in the voltage, but PT2OBT and PVT2OBT only maintained a detectivity of approximately 1011 to 1012 Jones. In addition, compared to our previous study (P3HT and PDTFBT),53 PFBT2OBT showed much improved detectivity. Overall, the PFBT2OBT devices showed an excellent responsivity of over 0.28 A W−1 and a detectivity of over 1013 Jones with constant values under various reverse biases and light intensities, which is highly suitable for indirect X-ray photodetecting materials. (1) (2)
We also calculated the responsivity from the external quantum efficiency (EQE) at −2 V. The calculated responsivities of PT2OBT, PVT2OBT and PFBT2OBT are shown in Fig. S14,† and were 0.20, 0.24 and 0.30 A W−1 at 530 nm, respectively. Considering the different approach between the direct measurement under LED light and the conversion from the EQE results, all the devices provide reliable experimental results for the responsivity.
Morphological examination
The relationship between the polymer structure and photodetecting properties was examined in terms of the molecular morphology and orientation. The miscibility between the polymer (PT2OBT, PVT2OBT, or PFBT2OBT) and PC70BM was measured by TEM. As shown in Fig. 4, the PFBT2OBT:PC70BM film showed a highly uniform nanomorphology with a fibrillar bi-continuous network, but the PC70BM fibers aggregated in the PVT2OBT:PC70BM film and even more so in the PT2OBT:PC70BM film. The well-mixed blending state of PFBT2OBT and PC70BM promoted charge separation and transport, resulting in an improved current density and responsivity, but phase aggregation led to the PT2OBT:PC70BM film having the lowest charge density under light illumination.

The molecular ordering and orientation of the blend films were revealed by 2D-GIXD. As shown in Fig. 5a–c, clear differences were observed in the molecular ordering and orientation of the polymers. PFBT2OBT showed a strong edge-on orientation, which is indicated by the average interval of the (100), (200), (300), and (400) reflections along the out-of-plane (Qz) axis of 0.38 Å−1, corresponding to a layer spacing of 16.5 Å, as well as by the (010) in-plane (Qxy) peaks at 1.70 Å−1, corresponding to an intermolecular π–π distance of ca. 3.70 Å (Fig. 5c). Contrary to PFBT2OBT, PT2OBT showed a (100) reflection along the Qxy axis of 0.35 Å−1 and a (010) peak along the Qz axis of 1.48 Å−1, implying that PT2OBT had a face-on orientation with a layer spacing of 17.9 Å and a π–π d-spacing of 4.24 Å (Fig. 5a). PVT2OBT showed no preferable orientation or ordering (Fig. 5b). The narrower π–π distance of the PFBT2OBT film and systematic (h00) reflection patterns indicate that PFBT2OBT forms a well-ordered layered structure with strong π–π stacking.

In the blend state, the azimuthally uniform reflections from PC70BM dominated, and the polymer reflection patterns weakened, but only the PFBT2OBT:PC70BM film showed substantial π–π intermolecular stacking and a layered structure for the PFBT2OBT polymer (Fig. 5f), indicating the strong edge-on ordering of PFBT2OBT. The fluorination in the polymer backbone is expected to enhance intra- and intermolecular ordering by a dipole–dipole interaction between fluorine and adjacent sulfur in the thiophene ring.54,55 You et al. demonstrated that the fluorinated polymers maintain high current density even at an active layer thickness of 1000 nm (ref. 56 and 57) and Woo et al. demonstrated a design strategy utilizing sulfur−fluorine and sulfur–oxygen interactions to make a rigid and planar backbone structure, similar to a fused ring system.58 Thus, the fluorinated PFBT2OBT maintained strong π–π stacking even after blending with PC70BM.
From the 2D-GIXD patterns of the polymers, we expect charge transport characteristics under dark conditions. As shown in Fig. 6a, PFBT2OBT prefers to have an edge-on orientation in the presence of PC70BM, and thus a large portion of alkyl side chains form an insulating layer at the interface with the electrode. Under dark conditions, this insulating layer prevents the conjugated backbones from contacting the electrode, which effectively reduced the leakage current. In contrast, PT2OBT or PVT2OBT has no preferred molecular orientation in the blend state (Fig. 5d and e), which implies that the interface between the conjugated backbones and PC70BM can make contact with the electrode to form a pathway for the leakage current (Fig. 6b).

The SCLC mobilities of the polymer:PC70BM films were investigated to gain a better understanding of the photocurrent density properties in the photoelectric devices. Hole-only and electron-only devices were fabricated using ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC70BM/MoOx/Ag and ITO/ZnO/polymer:PC70BM/LiF/Al configurations, respectively, and the mobility in the SCLC trap-free regime was determined by the Mott–Gurney law from the slope of J1/2vs. V (Fig. S10†).59 The molecular ordering and orientation of the donor polymers are highly affected by the hole mobility. The edge-on oriented backbone ordering of PFBT2OBT exhibited a lower hole mobility of 1.5 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 compared to the face-on preferred PT2OBT polymer (4.1 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) because vertical charge transfer is not very favorable in edge-on oriented films. In addition, due to the azimuthally uniform orientation of PC70BM, the nanomorphology of the blend film is crucial to determine the electron mobility. Thus, the PFBT2OBT:PC70BM films, which showed a highly uniform nanomorphology with a bi-continuous network, exhibited the highest electron mobility of 4.1 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, which was one order of magnitude higher than that of the PT2OBT:PC70BM and PVT2OBT:PC70BM blend films. Therefore, the SCLC mobility supports the 2D-GIXD and TEM results.
Conclusions
We synthesized three photodetecting conjugated polymers, PT2OBT, PVT2OBT and PFBT2OBT, based on 4,7-bis(4-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)-5,6-bis(octyloxy)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole. The weak electron-withdrawing properties of alkoxybenzothiadiazole weaken the ICT interaction between adjacent comonomers, making the polymers suitable for green-light absorption. Importantly, the extension of the π-conjugation length along the polymer backbone via the incorporation of vinylene or difluorobenzene moieties influences the molecular orientation and nanomorphology. As the π-conjugation length of the polymer increased, the nanomorphology of the polymer-PC70BM blend became more crumpled, and a better bicontinuous nanostructure was formed, indicating improved charge transfer in the PFBT2OBT:PC70BM devices. In addition, the difluorobenzene-incorporated PFBT2OBT polymer showed a strong edge-on orientation with a clear layered structure, whereas the PT2OBT polymer exhibited π–π stacking with a face-on orientation and PVT2OBT did not show oriented molecular stacking. The strong edge-on ordering of PFBT2OBT, even after blending with PC70BM, leads to the alignment of the insulating alkyl side chains on the surface of the electrode, resulting in the effective reduction of the leakage current in the PFBT2OBT:PC70BM devices. As a result, the PFBT2OBT:PC70BM devices showed the highest detectivity of over 1013 Jones at −2 V and the best responsivity of 0.28 A W−1 among the devices using the newly synthesized polymers.

General characterization

1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Ascend™-400 spectrometer, with tetramethylsilane as an internal reference. The absorption spectra were obtained on a SHIMADZU/UV-2550 model UV−vis spectrophotometer. Cyclic voltammetry was performed on a BAS 100B/W electrochemical analyzer with a three-electrode cell in a 0.1 N Bu4NBF4 solution in acetonitrile at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. The polymer film was coated onto a Pt wire electrode by dipping the electrode into a polymer solution in chloroform. All measurements were calibrated against an internal standard of ferrocene (Fc), the ionization potential (IP) value of which is −4.8 eV for the Fc/Fc+ redox system. The number- and weight-average molecular weights of the polymers were determined by gel-permeation chromatography (GPC) with a Waters 2690 Associates liquid chromatography instrument equipped with a Waters 2414 differential refractometer. Chloroform was used as the eluent and polystyrene was used as the standard. The morphology of the PDTFBT:PC70BM blend films was measured by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis (TECNAI G2 instrument). Elemental analysis of the synthesized polymers was performed by using a Thermo Scientific FLASH EA-2000 Organic Elemental Analyzer.
Two-dimensional grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction (2D-GIXD)
2D-GIXD measurements were performed under vacuum at the 6D beamline at Pohang Light Source, Korea. The samples were prepared on ZnO-modified Si substrates under the same conditions as those used for the fabrication of solar cell devices. The wavelength of the X-rays was 0.1069 nm and the incidence angle (i.e., the angle between the critical angle of the sample and that of Si) was 0.12°. 2D-GIXD patterns were recorded using a 2D-CCD detector (MX225-HS, Rayonix LLC, USA), and the X-ray irradiation time was set at 0.5 to 10 s, depending on the saturation level of the detector. The 2D-GIXD images from the films were analyzed based on the relationship between the scattering vector (q) and the d spacing (q = 2π/d).
Fabrication of photodiodes
The inverted devices were fabricated with the following structure, ITO/ZnO/polymers:PC70BM/MoO3/Ag. The procedure for cleaning the ITO surface included sonication and rinsing in distilled water, methanol, and acetone. An electron transporting ZnO layer (30 nm) was spin-coated onto each ITO substrate. The polymer solution for the active layer was prepared by dissolving the polymer (12 mg mL−1) with PC70BM in 1,2-dichlorobenzene. The polymer:PC70BM blended solutions were spin-coated onto the ZnO layer. MoO3 and Ag were deposited sequentially under a vacuum pressure of <3 × 10−6 Torr, resulting in an active area of 0.09 cm2. The thickness of the active layer was measured using a KLA Tencor Alpha-Step IQ surface profilometer with an accuracy of ±1 nm. The J–V characteristics of the OPDs were measured under green LED light (Thorlabs, M530L3) in the range of 5.56 μW–5.44 mW cm−2. The intensity of the light was calibrated by using a standard photodiode power sensor (Thorlabs, S120C) with a compact power and energy meter console. Electronic data were recorded using a Keithley 2635B source-measure unit, and all characterizations were carried out in an ambient environment. Measurements were carried out after masking all but the active cell area of the fabricated device. All characterization steps were carried out under an ambient laboratory atmosphere.
