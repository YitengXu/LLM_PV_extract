1. Introduction and historical development
Global energy consumption is projected to rise from 540.5 quadrillion Btu in 2011 to 815.0 quadrillion Btu by 2040.1 The increasing awareness of both energy shortage and global warming stimulates numerous efforts to develop new and sustainable energy resources. Hydrogen, a fuel with high specific enthalpy of combustion and clean combustion products, has attracted great attention as a promising alternative to fossil fuels to process the current energy crisis and environmental pollution.2 The carbon-free H2 can either be used in an internal combustion engine like other fossil fuels to power vehicles or it can be used to produce electricity via fuel cells. Currently, hydrogen is mainly obtained from natural gas through steam methane reforming, and the produced H2 is still a fossil product rather than renewable energy. One of the key issues for the application of hydrogen fuel is the development of an effective H2-preparation approach that does not depend on the use of fossil fuels. 2H2O → 2H2 + O2(1)ΔEo = 1.23 eV 2H2O → 4H+ + 4e− + O2(2)Eo = +1.23 V vs. NHE, pH 0 4H+ + 4e− → 2H2(3)Eo = 0 V vs. NHE, pH 0
Solar hydrogen generation via artificial photosynthesis represents a promising way to convert and store solar energy into chemical H2 fuel since the pioneering discovery of a photoelectrochemical water splitting cell using a Pt/TiO2 electrode for H2 production by Fujishima and Honda in 1972.3 During the past four decades, photocatalytic H2 production from water has been undertaken in several different embodiments, including semiconductor-based heterogeneous systems,4–14 molecular material-based homogeneous systems,15–20 and organic–inorganic hybrid systems.21–25 The research area dealing with solar H2 generation is expanding rapidly and attracting researchers from different disciplines: (1) materials scientists to design and synthesize novel photocatalysis materials with unique structures;26–35 (2) chemists to develop molecular photosensitizers and catalysts and establish structure–property relationships for homogeneous solar H2 generation systems;36–40 and (3) physicists to construct novel semiconductor photocatalysts and understand the fundamental physical processes.41–45 The synergy between all these disciplines would play a key role for future advancement in this solar H2 generation field. The photocatalytic overall water splitting reaction (eqn (1)) is a typical “uphill reaction” with a large positive Gibbs energy change of ΔG = +237.13 kJ mol−1, corresponding to a minimum energy of 1.23 eV per photon.46

Fig. 1 illustrates that the basic processes of a semiconductor photocatalyst for overall water splitting comprises three steps:47,48 first, absorption of photons to induce electron transfer from the valence band (VB) to the conduction band (CB), creating electron–hole pairs; second, the photogenerated charge carriers (electrons and holes) migrate to the surface of the semiconductor; third, the free electrons and holes react with H2O to evolve H2 and O2, respectively. During the second step, electrons easily recombine with the excited holes, resulting in poor photocatalytic activity for overall water splitting. It is worth noting that the band gap and the levels of the conduction and valence bands are key factors in determining the photocatalytic performance of semiconductor photocatalysts. Generally, the photolysis of water is thermodynamically feasible when the semiconductor photocatalyst has a more negative CB level than the redox potential of H+/H2 (0 V vs. NHE, pH 0) as well as a more positive valence band level than the redox potential of O2/H2O (1.23 V vs. NHE, pH 0).49,50 Although the semiconductor photocatalysts is capable of overall water splitting in thermodynamics, the photocatalytic overall water splitting into H2 and O2 is difficult to occur kinetically owing to the complexity involved the 4-electron–4-hole transfer process.51,52 Developing an overall water splitting system is a daunting challenge, and water splitting is generally addressed as two half-reactions: water reduction to evolve H2 and water oxidation to produce O2.53,54 The standard reduction potential of both H2 and O2 evolution half reactions is illustrated in eqn (2) and (3), respectively. In these H2 and O2 evolution half-reaction systems, the other half-reaction was replacing by an appropriate sacrificial reductant (such as methanol,55 ethanol,56 triethanolamine,57 triethylamine,58 ascorbic acid,59 lactic acid,60 ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid,61 and Na2S/Na2SO3 pairs62) or sacrificial oxidant (AgNO3,63 and Na2S2O8 (ref. 64)), respectively. During the past 40 years, various semiconductor photocatalysts were designed and developed for photocatalytic H2 production from water, such as metal oxides (TiO2,65–69 ZrO2,70–73 ZnO,74–76 Cu2O,77–79 Ta2O5,80–82 NaTaO3,83,84 NaNbO3,85–87 Ga2O3,88,89 CoO,90 and SrTiO3 (ref. 91–93)), sulfides (CdS,94–96 ZnS,97–100 ZnIn2S4,101–103 CuInS2,104–106 and Cu2ZnSnS4 (ref. 107 and 108)), selenides (CdSe109,110), oxynitrides (TaON,111 LaTaON2,112 and BaTaO2N113), inorganic solid solutions (ZnO:GaN,113–115 ZnS–AgInS2,116,117 ZnS–CuInS2–AgInS2,118,119 and ZnS–CdS120–128), and organic compounds (6,13-pentacenequinone129 and g-C3N4 (ref. 130–132)). Among them, CdS is thought to be one of the most renowned photocatalysts for H2 production owing to its suitable bandgap, low cost, relatively high stability, and excellent reactivity.133–140

Significant advances have been made in the field of solar H2 generation, and review papers have reported advances in heterogeneous photocatalysts,5,10 inorganic co-catalysts,47,141 and charge transfer materials142–144 in heterogeneous photocatalytic systems for H2 production. Recent review papers have also addressed some semiconductor photocatalysts, including TiO29,145,146 and g-C3N4 (ref. 147–149) for solar H2 generation.65 However, no comprehensive review has focused on the recent progress of CdS-based photocatalysts for photocatalytic H2 production, and we believe that the in-depth review paper on CdS-based photocatalysts is timely to promote further advancement in the field of solar-to-H2 conversion. In the present review, we systematically review the recent progress in the field of photocatalytic H2 production relevant to CdS-based photocatalysts. Firstly, the fundamental properties, such as the crystal structure, band structures and photophysical property, were introduced in detail. Then, various CdS-based photocatalysts, including heterojunctions, solid solutions and quantum dots, used as photocatalysts are surveyed, and those important factors affecting photocatalytic performances are also discussed. The property–structure relationship of CdS-based photocatalysts is emphasized. In the final section, future opportunities and challenges in research on CdS-based photocatalysts for solar H2 generation are also presented.
2. Basic properties of CdS
CdS has two main structural polytypes, wurtzite and zinc blende structures.150 The structural parameters of both wurtzite and zinc blende CdS are illustrated in Table 1. The schematic structures of wurtzite and zinc blende nanoparticles of CdS are illustrated in Fig. 2a and b. In both wurtzite and zinc blende structures, Cd and S atoms are tetrahedrally coordinated. Generally, bulk CdS has a hexagonal wurtzite-type crystal structure with the space group P63mc with a = 0.4160 nm and c = 0.6756 nm. The cubic zinc structure is observed only in CdS nanocrystallites prepared under an ambient pressure. At ambient pressure, CdS nanocrystallites have a cubic zinc blende structure with the space group F3m and lattice constant a = 0.5832 nm. The wurtzite to zinc blende transformation involves only a change in symmetry from hexagonal to cubic. These obvious differences in lattice parameters result in different electronic band structures in different crystal phase types of CdS. Previous studies have shown that the crystal structure of CdS tends to change from the hexagonal wurtzite type to the cubic zinc blende type as the size of CdS nanoparticles decreases.151 These calculated values for hexagonal wurtzite and cubic zinc blende type CdS were estimated to be 2.4 eV and 2.3 eV, respectively.152 In the band structure of CdS, S 3p orbitals contribute to the top of the VB, while Cd 5s and 5p orbitals contribute to the bottom of the CB. The lower position of the CB is dominated by Cd 3d orbitals.153,154

The photocatalytic H2 evolution reaction is initiated by light absorption. Therefore, the photocatalytic performance of semiconductor photocatalysts is first restricted by their light-harvesting capacity. Fig. 3 shows the bandgap energy and VB and CB energy level positions of commonly used semiconductor photocatalysts, along with selected redox potentials.155,156 Obviously, these wide-bandgap semiconductors, including ZrO2, KTaO3, ZnS, SrTiO3, TiO2, ZnO and SiC, can only utilize the light in the ultraviolet region for photocatalytic reactions, resulting in low solar-to-H2 conversion efficiency. The narrow range of spectral responses is one of the biggest drawbacks of the above-mentioned semiconductor photocatalysts. Several approaches have been devoted to extending the light absorption of these wide-bandgap semiconductor photocatalyst to the visible region, including element doping and surface sensitization.145,157 In fact, most of these doped and dye-sensitized semiconductor materials are inactive or slightly active photocatalysts for photocatalytic H2 production under visible light irradiation.158 For Cu2O, GaP, WO3 and Fe2O3, their practical application for photocatalytic water splitting was limited by either mismatched VB or CB levels. That is, the VB level of Cu2O and GaP is more negative than that of the O2/H2O redox couple (1.23 V vs. NHE, pH = 0), whereas the CB level of WO3 and Fe2O3 is more positive than that of the H+/H2 redox couple (0 V vs. NHE, pH = 0). Besides, the poor chemical stability is the biggest drawback of Cu2O-based photocatalysts. It is worth noting that both CdS and g-C3N4 have suitable bandgap energy and band edge positions for photocatalytic water splitting. As compared to g-C3N4, CdS has a broader absorption in the visible light region owing to its narrower bandgap and suitable CB and VB positions. Furthermore, intimate interfaces between CdS and cocatalysts are more easily formed by heat treatment, which could play one of the key roles in determining the photocatalytic performance for water splitting. As already mentioned, CdS could be one of the most promising candidates as photocatalysts for solar H2 generation.

3. CdS-based materials for solar H2 evolution
3.1 Noble metals–CdS heterojunction photocatalysts for solar H2 evolution
Since the pioneering work of Darwent and Porter in 1981 who succeeded in reducing H2O to H2 under visible light irradiation employing CdS as the photocatalyst in aerated water splitting, CdS has emerged as one of the most classical semiconductor photocatalysts for photocatalytic H2 production.159 However, bare CdS exhibited poor photocatalytic activity owing to the rapid recombination of photogenerated charge carriers consisting of bulk recombination and surface recombination. Loading of Pt on CdS can significantly improve the photocatalytic performance of the CdS photocatalyst, and the platinized CdS composite was found to be 20 times more efficient for photocatalytic H2 production than bare CdS.160 The apparent quantum yield of Pt/CdS photocatalysts has been reported to be 4% under monochromatic irradiation at 436 nm obtained on a Pt/CdS photocatalyst in the presence of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) as the sacrificial reagent. Nano-sized Pt is an excellent hydrogen evolution catalyst, and modification of a CdS photocatalyst by loading Pt nanoparticles is able to stimulate photogenerated charge transfer and accelerate the hydrogen evolution reaction, thereby increasing the photocatalytic performance. Li et al. reported that CdS nanoparticles co-loaded with Pt and PdS cocatalysts can achieve a high quantum yield of 93% at 420 nm for photocatalytic H2 production using Na2S and Na2SO3 as the sacrificial reagents.161 As illustrated in Fig. 4, the Pt–PdS/CdS photocatalyst showed much higher photocatalytic H2 evolution activity than those of both Pt/CdS and PdS/CdS samples. In the Pt–PdS/CdS composite photocatalyst, the existence of Pt acting as a H2 evolution cocatalyst and PdS acting as a sulfide oxidation cocatalyst accelerated the separation and transfer of photoexcited electrons and holes, resulting in an extremely high quantum yield. Furthermore, Gráutzel et al. found that the illumination of CdS nanoparticles loaded with Pt and RuO2 by visible light produced H2 and O2 in stoichiometric proportions.162 The simultaneous existence of RuO2 acting as a water oxidation cocatalyst for O2 evolution and Pt acting as a water reduction cocatalyst for H2 evolution is supposed to be beneficial for the rapid separation and transfer of photogenerated electrons and holes, thus making Pt–RuO2/CdS an active photocatalyst for overall water spitting. For the photocatalysts mentioned above, the oxidation cocatalysts of PbS and RuO2 can efficiently accelerate the transfer of holes from the CdS valence band to the aqueous solution, thus inhibiting the photocorrosion of CdS.

Pt nanoparticles can act as a highly efficient cocatalyst to enhance the photocatalytic performance of CdS for H2 production.161–163 It is highly desirable to minimize the utilization of expensive noble metals. Fu et al. have developed a simple and rapid one-pot solvothermal method to synthesize platinized CdS nanorods.164 The formation of CdS nanorods and the deposition of Pt nanoparticles can be achieved simultaneously by this method, which is more efficient than conventional photo-deposition and impregnation-reduction routes, to enhance the photocatalytic H2 evolution activity of CdS. Under visible light irradiation, the H2 evolution rate of CdS was significantly enhanced from 2.10 to 10.29 mmol h−1 g−1 in the presence of only a 0.06% Pt cocatalyst. Furthermore, the size of Pt nanoparticles can efficiently affect the photocatalytic H2 production activity of Pt loaded CdS photocatalysts. Jäckel et al. presented a study of Pt cluster size effects on the photocatalytic H2 evolution reaction.165 The maximum H2 evolution rate was observed for Pt46, mainly ascribed to the optimum energetic position of the Pt cluster's lowest unoccupied molecular orbital for the given Pt–CdS photocatalytic system. That is, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital of Pt46 appeared to be best situated out of all the Pt clusters measured for the H2 evolution on Pt-loaded CdS nanorods.
For cocatalyst loaded CdS photocatalysts, the high charge recombination rate leads to a low efficiency. Therefore, it is highly desirable to reveal the transfer rates in the complete electron pathway. Stolarczyk et al. varied the decoration of Pt nanoparticles on CdS nanorods to investigate the important role of pathways for the photogenerated electrons of CdS to the Pt cocatalyst.166 As shown in Fig. 5a, two different deposition techniques were used to prepare platinum nanoparticle loaded CdS nanorod photocatalysts. In the first approach, a single platinum nanoparticle was selectively attached at the tip of CdS nanorods (CdS–Pt at the tip, Fig. 5b). In the second approach, multiple small Pt clusters were grown on the whole surface of the CdS nanorods (CdS–Pt clusters, Fig. 5c). As shown in Fig. 5d, the relaxation of the 1S exciton bleach of Pt cluster loaded CdS becomes much faster in comparison to those of the pure CdS nanorods and CdS nanorods with a single Pt particle at the tip. The results demonstrated that the shortening of the charge transfer path, by increasing the number of Pt nanoparticles, can accelerate the electron transfer but decrease the photocatalytic H2 evolution performance (Fig. 5e). This phenomenon is ascribed to the fact that the photogenerated electrons can rapidly recombine with the nearby holes. This approach indicated that highly efficient semiconductor photocatalysts may be synthesized with only a minimal number of cocatalysts. In this case, the improvement of photocatalytic activity can be realized by removing the photogenerated holes so that the electrons in the Pt nanoparticles have no hole to recombine with. An efficient approach is to use hole scavengers with large drive forces for faster hole transfer rates.167 Xu et al. found that the solution environment of Pt photodeposition played a key role in determining the photocatalytic performance of Pt/CdS.168 The Pt/CdS sample with Pt reduced in alkaline solution showed a significantly higher photocatalytic H2 evolution activity than Pt/CdS photocatalysts prepared in acidic or neutral solution. XPS analysis revealed that the Pt4+ species can be well reduced to metallic Pt0 under alkaline conditions, while Pt4+ species can only be partially transformed to Pt2+ species dispersed on the surface of CdS under acidic or neutral conditions.

For Pt loaded CdS photocatalysts, the photogenerated charge transfer efficiency between CdS and Pt plays a key role in determining their photocatalytic activity. A recent study indicated that graphene with improved conductivity can reduce the recombination probability of photogenerated charge, enhancing the photocatalytic performance of CdS.169 To accelerate the photogenerated electron transfer from CdS to Pt, Yu et al. reported the synthesis of the ternary CdS/RGO/Pt photocatalyst (RGO: reduced graphene oxide) for enhanced photocatalytic H2 production activity.170 As shown in Fig. 6a, the CdS/RGO/Pt composite with 1.0 wt% RGO and 0.5 wt% Pt reached a high H2 evolution rate of 56 mmol h−1 g−1 under visible-light irradiation with an apparent quantum yield of 22.5% at 420 nm. This superior photocatalytic H2 evolution activity is mainly ascribed to the role of graphene, which acts as an efficient electron collector and transporter to prolong the lifetime of photogenerated electron–hole pairs from CdS nanoparticles (Fig. 6b). Meanwhile, the carbon nanotubes could also act as an efficient electron collector and transporter to accelerate the photogenerated charge from CdS to the Pt cocatalyst.171

Apart from Pt, noble metals such as Ru172 and Pd173–175 are also highly efficient cocatalysts to enhance the photocatalytic performance of CdS. For example, Zhang et al. reported enhancement of the photocatalytic H2 evolution performance of aluminum-substituted mesoporous silica (Al-HMS)-coupled CdS (CdS/Al-HMS) by loading Ru clusters as the cocatalyst. The Ru clusters possess a lower Fermi energy level and a higher work function, which can promote photogenerated charge transfer and improve the photocatalytic performance of CdS/Al-HMS. The 0.07 wt% Ru loaded CdS/Al-HMS composite exhibited the highest photocatalytic activity with a H2 evolution rate of 3.7 mL h−1 under visible light irradiation (λ ≥ 420 nm) and an apparent quantum yield of 1.2% at 420 nm.172 Kim et al. reported the synthesis of Pd nanoparticles deposited on CdS nanorods and investigated the role of Pd nanoparticle size in the photocatalytic H2 evolution.173 The Pd/CdS composite photocatalysts showed an enhanced and size-dependent photocatalytic H2 evolution rate. Among all of the Pd/CdS composite photocatalysts, the Pd/CdS composite with a Pd size range of 5–6 nm showed the highest H2 evolution rate, which is about 13 times higher than that observed for pure CdS. In order to re-use Pd cocatalysts, Lei et al. prepared wool-supported palladium nanoparticle (wool-Pd) cocatalyst for the enhancement of photocatalytic H2 generation on CdS.174 It is of great significance that the wool-Pd catalyst can be taken out of the mixture with tweezers for reuse from the practical application point of view.
It is well known that the size, shape, and crystal structure of CdS photocatalysts can affect directly their photocatalytic activities for H2 production. So far, various morphologies of CdS nanostructures, such as nanoparticles,170 nanorods,96,166 nanosheets,95 and nanowires,94,175,176 have been designed and prepared successfully for photocatalytic H2 production. To investigate the morphology-dependent photocatalytic H2 evolution performance of CdS, Yu et al. synthesized various morphologies of CdS photocatalysts, including nanorods, nanowires and urchin-like shapes, cauliflower-like shapes, nanoparticles and hollow spheres through a solvothermal route by adjusting the used solvent and sulfur sources (Fig. 7).177 The results showed that the morphology and crystal structure of CdS play key roles in achieving highly efficient photocatalytic H2 evolution. The as-prepared CdS nanowires synthesized in tetraethylenepentamine showed the highest photocatalytic H2 evolution rate of 16.06 mmol h−1 g−1 with an apparent quantum yield of 37.7% at 420 nm, which was about 2.2 times higher than that of CdS nanoparticles obtained in dodecylamine solvent. The higher photocatalytic activity of CdS nanowires was mainly ascribed to their small diameter, which makes it easy for photogenerated charge to migrate to the surface active sites of CdS. Hence, the nature of solvent can affect obviously the morphology and photocatalytic H2 evolution performance of CdS. Zhang et al. prepared ultrathin CdS nanosheets with a thickness of ∼4 nm for enhanced photocatalytic H2 production.178 The average H2 evolution rate of the as-prepared CdS ultrathin nanosheets reached 41.1 mmol h−1 g−1. The superior photocatalytic H2 evolution activity of ultrathin CdS nanosheets could be ascribed to their huge specific surface area and abundant uncoordinated surface atoms.

To investigate the crystal-facet-dependent effect of CdS microcrystals on photocatalytic H2 evolution activity, Zhang et al. reported the preparation of two-dimensional CdS micro/nano-leaves (CdS-MNLs) with a high percentage of the exposed (0001) plane via a hydrothermal process by using hydrofluoric acid (HF) as a capping agent.179 The pure CdS micro/nano-leaves exhibited the highest photocatalytic activity with an average H2 evolution rate of 2.47 mmol h−1 g−1 under visible light irradiation without any noble metal cocatalyst, which is more than 5 times that of spheroidal CdS nanoparticles under the same reaction conductions. The superior photocatalytic performance of the CdS micro/nano-leaves was mainly ascribed to the unique flake-like morphology, high crystallinity and the exposed (0001) high surface energy plane. To investigate the influence of the crystalline phase on the photocatalytic performance of CdS photocatalysts, a series of CdS with different ratios of wurtzite to zinc blende phases were prepared via a simple solvothermal synthetic route.180 The obtained results showed that the wurtzite phase of CdS plays a key role in determining the photocatalytic H2 production activities of CdS photocatalysts, and the H2 evolution rate strictly increased with increasing percentage of the wurtzite phase. The optimized CdS nanorods with a 64% wurtzite phase showed the highest H2 evolution rate of 4.628 mmol h−1 g−1 with an apparent quantum efficiency of 28% under 420 nm monochromatic light, which is about 16.6 times higher than that of CdS nanocrystals with a low content (38.4%) of the wurtzite phase. This excellent photocatalytic activity of wurtzite phase-dominant CdS could be assigned to the formation of mesopores and macropores in the multi-armed nanorods.
To investigate the effect of crystalline phases on the photocatalytic performance of CdS, Li et al. compared the photocatalytic activity of cubic and hexagonal CdS nanocrystallites, and hexagonal phase-dominant CdS displayed a much higher activity for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution than cubic hexagonal-phase CdS.181 Yu et al. reported the synthesis of hierarchical porous CdS nanosheet-assembled flowers (CdS NAFs) via a simple ion-exchange strategy by using Na2S and morphology-analogous Cd(OH)2 as the precursors. The synthesized CdS nanosheet-assembled flowers showed high photocatalytic activity with a H2 evolution rate of 9.374 mmol h−1 g−1 under visible light irradiation and an apparent quantum yield of 24.7% at 420 nm, which is about 3 times that of CdS nanoparticles.182 This excellent photocatalytic performance of the as-prepared CdS flowers can be ascribed to the hierarchical porous nanosheet structures, which can efficiently enhance visible light harvesting capacity and provide a large number of active sites. In a word, these factors, including the specific surface area, nature of the surface, crystallinity and band energy positions, can affect the photocatalytic activities of CdS photocatalysts. The overall photocatalytic efficiency for H2 production is determined by these above factors altogether.
3.2 Transition metal based cocatalyst loaded CdS heterojunction photocatalysts for solar H2 evolution
Noble metal nanoparticles such as Pt,160–171 Ru,172 Pd,173,183etc., can act as highly efficient cocatalysts to improve the photocatalytic H2 production activity of CdS. However, the high cost of noble metals limits their widespread application. In 2008, Li et al. reported a composite consisting of MoS2 nanosheets grown on the surface of CdS nanoparticles as a highly efficient noble-metal-free photocatalyst for photocatalytic H2 evolution.184 The 0.2 wt% MoS2/CdS composite showed the highest activity with a H2 evolution rate of 5.4 mmol h−1 g−1. It is worth noting that the 0.2 wt% MoS2/CdS photocatalyst exhibited much higher H2 evolution activity than noble metal such as Pt, Pd, Rh, Ru, and Au modified CdS photocatalysts under the same reaction conductions. The excellent H2 activation properties of MoS2 and the intimate junction exhibited between CdS and MoS2 are supposed to be responsible for the enhanced photocatalytic H2 production activity of MoS2/CdS photocatalysts.185 Furthermore, the construction of 2D p–n nanojunctions between MoS2 and CdS can hamper the recombination of photogenerated charge. Due to the unique p–n nanojunction, large specific surface area and strong electronic coupling, the 2D MoS2/CdS nanocomposites manifested a high H2 evolution rate of ∼6.85 mmol h−1 g−1 under visible-light irradiation and an apparent quantum efficiency of 10.5% at 450 nm.186 A similar phenomenon was also observed in other 2D MoS2/CdS nanocomposites.187–190
For most previously reported MoS2/CdS photocatalysts, considerable efforts have been devoted to preparing various CdS/MoS2 composites, such as branches,191 core–shell,192 flowers,193 balls,194 and so on. However, these hybrid photocatalysts exhibit limited contact interfaces for photoinduced charge transfer. Recently, researchers found that the loading of 2D MoS2 nanosheets onto 1D CdS nanorods allows the exposure of almost the entire surface and the edge active sites. More importantly, connecting the edges of 2D MoS2 nanosheets with 1D CdS nanorods provides a better electron transport pathway for the photocatalytic H2 evolution reaction, resulting in the high photocatalytic performance of 2D/1D MoS2/CdS photocatalysts.190,195–197 It has been known that the coordinatively unsaturated S atoms on the exposed edges of MoS2 nanosheets are the active sites for the H2 evolution reaction. To increase the number of unsaturated S atoms, Huang et al. reported the synthesis of oxygen-incorporated defect-rich MoS2 ultrathin nanosheets to enhance the photocatalytic performance of CdS irregular nanospheres.198 These as-prepared photocatalysts showed superior photocatalytic performance with a H2 evolution rate of ∼17.2037 mmol h−1 g−1, which is much higher than those of other MoS2/CdS photocatalysts. The high catalytic activity of oxygen-incorporated defect-rich MoS2 nanosheets can be assigned to both the increased active sites of unsaturated S atoms in the defect-rich structure and enhanced intrinsic conductivity related to the O incorporation. That is, the abundant unsaturated S atoms of defect-rich MoS2 nanosheets with O incorporation could have a higher electric conductivity and a lower energy barrier for the H2 evolution reaction compared with pristine MoS2, thus enhancing their photocatalytic performance.
Generally, the photocatalytic H2 evolution reaction requires efficient charge transfer to water reduction reaction active sites in competition with electron–hole recombination. Thus, regulating the charge-carrier dynamics in the H2 generation process is crucial for optimizing the nanostructures of MoS2/CdS photocatalysts.193–195 To accelerate the photogenerated charge transfer, Park et al. synthesized a MoS2-tipped CdS nanorod heterostructure photocatalysts by using S-terminated CdS nanorods as the heterogeneous nucleation site for the growth of MoS2 (Fig. 8a–d).199 Under simulated solar light (AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2), the designed MoS2/CdS heterostructure photocatalyst achieved the highest H2 rate of 8.44 mmol h−1 g−1 with an apparent yield of 22.2% at 420 nm. The impressive photocatalytic performance of MoS2/CdS photocatalysts was mainly ascribed to their unique morphology. The MoS2 cocatalyst precisely grown at the end of the CdS nanorods showed rapid charge transfer and low charge recombination through spatially localized deeper energy states, as determined by steady-state photoluminescence and time-resolved photoluminescence spectrometry (Fig. 8e and f).

Apart from the active exposed edge sites, the electric conductivity of MoS2 is another key factor in determining the photocatalytic H2 evolution performance. Unfortunately, owing to the poor interdomain charge transport, nanosized MoS2 exhibits poor electrical conductivity, which remarkably limits its catalytic activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction. Kim et al. demonstrated an effective approach to improve the conductivity of MoS2 by using hydrazine assisted liquid exfoliation for enhancing its co-catalytic activity in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. Under natural sunlight, the resulting ultrathin MoS2 (HUT-MoS2) nanosheet coated CdS nanorods showed a superior H2 evolution rate of 238 mmol h−1 g−1, which is the highest photocatalytic activity ever reported for CdS/MoS2 photocatalysts.200 Furthermore, Ye et al. reported that MoS2/graphene exhibited much higher catalytic activity on CdS than bare MoS2 and graphene (Fig. 9a).201 The MoS2/graphene–CdS composite photocatalyst exhibited high photocatalytic H2 evolution activity with a rate as high as 9 mmol h−1 g−1, for the sample containing a 2% MoS2/graphene hybrid cocatalyst and a molar ratio of MoS2 to graphene of 1:2. The corresponding apparent quantum yield reached 28.1% at 420 nm (Fig. 9b). The incorporation of graphene between CdS and MoS2 can accelerate interfacial charge transfer and suppress charge recombination, improving both the photocatalytic activity and the stability of MoS2/graphene-CdS composite photocatalysts. That is, the graphene acting as a conductive electron transport “highway” accelerates the photogenerated charge transfer from the conduction band of CdS to MoS2 nanosheets. Similar results were observed in other reported MoS2/graphene-CdS composite photocatalysts.202–209 In addition, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) can be used as an electron transfer mediator to accelerate the photogenerated charge transfer from CdS to MoS2.210,211

The electrical conductivity of cocatalysts can affect their catalytic activities. It has been known that WS2 exhibits a higher intrinsic electric conductivity than MoS2.212 In 2011, Li et al. found that the photocatalytic performance of CdS could also be enhanced significantly by loading WS2 as a cocatalyst. The 1.0 wt% WS2/CdS composite showed the highest photocatalytic activity with a H2 evolution rate of 4.2 mmol h−1 g−1, and WS2 demonstrates comparable catalytic activity with those of noble metals such as Pt, Rh, Ru and Au.213 Kim et al. synthesized highly efficient few-layered WS2 nanosheet modified CdS nanorods for photocatalytic H2 production. In those WS2/CdS photocatalysts, the ultrathin WS2 nanosheets were uniformly and discontinuously grown along the CdS nanorods. The optimized 6% WS2/CdS photocatalyst shows a tremendous H2 evolution rate of 185.79 mmol h−1 g−1 under simulated solar light irradiation with an apparent quantum yield of 40.5%, which is about 33 times greater than that of bare CdS and 3.5 times higher than that of few-layered WS2–CdS photocatalysts. The superior photocatalytic performance of few-layered WS2 nanosheet modified CdS nanorods can be attributed to both the intimate and uniform contact between WS2 and CdS and the superior intrinsic electrical conductivity of WS2.214
Recently, nanosized CuS with a narrow bandgap has recently attracted great attention for photocatalytic H2 production due to the potential application value as a co-catalyst.215–217 Xiang et al. fabricated a CdS/CuS heterojunction via a one-pot room-temperature solid-state method for enhanced photocatalytic H2 production.218 The 2.5% CuS/CdS nano-heterojunction composite photocatalyst showed the highest photocatalytic activity under visible-light irradiation with a H2 evolution rate of 3.417 mmol h−1 g−1, which is about 6 times that of bare CdS under the same reaction conductions. The enhanced photocatalytic performance and improved photostability of CuS/CdS samples were mainly attributed to the promoted charge separation/transfer properties due to the optimized energy band structure. Although CuS/CdS nanocomposites have been suggested as effective and sustainable photocatalysts for H2 production, the effect of CuS on the photocatalytic H2 evolution activity of CdS was still poorly understood.219 To further understand the effect of CuS on the photocatalytic activity of CdS and improve the photocatalytic performance of CuS/CdS composites, Armatas et al. synthesized three-dimensional mesoporous CuS/CdS nanocrystal photocatalysts.220 As a result, the 5% CuS/CdS photocatalyst exhibited the highest H2 evolution rate of 7 mmol h−1 g−1 with a 12.6% apparent quantum yield at 420 nm, while displaying good durability for at least 20 h. The photoluminescence and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analysis indicated that the high H2-evolution activity of the designed CuS/CdS photocatalyst was mainly ascribed to the proper alignment of the band-edge positions of CdS and CuS. More importantly, the nanoscale p–n junction formed between CdS and CuS positively shifted the band-edge potentials, thus improving the separation of photogenerated charge and the H2 evolution activity. In addition, the CuS can accept photoexcited electrons from the VB of CdS to form Cu2S nanoparticles, which was the active cocatalyst for the enhanced photocatalytic activity of CdS. During the photoreaction, part of Cu+ in Cu2S is easily reduced to Cu0 at the interface between CdS and Cu2S, while the remainder of Cu2S offers abundant active sites for the H2 evolution reaction. The formed multiple heterojunctions between Cu0/Cu2S and CdS retard the charge carrier recombination process, enhancing the photocatalytic H2 production performance of CdS.221 Du et al. reported that p-type Cu3P can act as an efficient promoter to enhance the photocatalytic activity of n-type cadmium sulphide nanorods. The p–n junction between Cu3P and CdS results in rapid electron transfer and improved photocatalytic activity. Under optimal conditions, the H2 evolution rate under visible light irradiation (λ > 420 nm) and apparent quantum yield at 450 nm reached as high as 200 mmol h−1 g−1 and 25%, respectively.222
NiS, as a p-type semiconductor, was proved to be an efficient co-catalyst to enhance the photocatalytic H2 production activity of CdS.223 To reveal the possible enhancement mechanism of NiS, Yu et al. prepared novel p-type NiS nanoparticle modified n-type CdS nanorod photocatalysts (Fig. 10a and b).224 It is believed that the formed p–n junction and inner electric field between NiS and CdS could effectively restrain the recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs (Fig. 10c and d), thus remarkably improving the photocatalytic activity. Meanwhile, the deposited NiS can act as an active cocatalyst for the oxidation sacrificial agents (Na2S–Na2S2O3 pairs), thus greatly improving the durability of CdS. The 5 mol% NiS/CdS sample exhibited the highest photocatalytic activity with a H2 evolution rate of 1131 μmol h−1 g−1, which is even much higher than that of the optimized Pt–CdS photocatalyst.

Zhukovskyi et al. prepared Ni nanoparticle decorated CdS nanosheet photocatalysts through the photodeposition method for photocatalytic H2 production in water–ethanol mixtures. The results showed that the Ni nanoparticle with an average nanoparticle diameter of 6 nm is an efficient cocatalyst. A high apparent quantum efficiency of 25% was obtained for the Ni/CdS photocatalyst.225 For CdS-based composite photocatalysts, the photogenerated electron transfer between components in one direction is one of the key factors for obtaining good charge transfer between them. To precisely control the position of each component in CdS-based composite photocatalysts, Do et al. prepared a novel type of CdS-based nanocomposite consisting of CdS nanoparticles, Ni clusters and ultrathin titanate nanodisks for photocatalytic H2 production under direct sunlight. In these composites, titanate nanodisks (TNDs) are in intimate contact with both CdS nanoparticles and Ni clusters, and thus the photogenerated electrons in the conduction band of CdS can be precisely transferred to Ni clusters through titanate nanodisks. Consequently, charge separation in the NCs is greatly enhanced as electrons are now separated from holes over the three different components. The composite photocatalysts could generate H2 with a rate as high as 31.82 mmol h−1 g−1 in ethanol aqueous solution under direct sunlight illumination.226
Exploiting earth-abundant cobalt-based cocatalysts to enhance the photocatalytic performance of CdS for H2 evolution is of great interest. Kang et al. found that the photocatalytic activity of CdS can be significantly enhanced by loading CoP nanoparticles as the cocatalyst. In the case of 3% CoP/CdS, the H2 evolution rate reached 106 mmol h−1 g−1 and the apparent quantum yield was up to 27.1% at 435 nm, which is about 2.5 times that of the Pt/CdS photocatalyst. The CoP nanoparticles loaded on the surface of CdS act as both charge separation centres and active sites for the H2 evolution reaction.227 Du et al. reported that noble-metal-free Co3N can act as an active cocatalyst to enhance the photocatalytic H2 production of CdS nanorods. As demonstrated by the photoelectrochemical measurements and photoluminescence spectra, the loading of Co3N onto CdS nanorods can restrain the recombination of photogenerated charge carriers, resulting in enhanced photocatalytic activity for H2 evolution. Under optimal conditions, the H2 evolution rate reached approximately ∼137.33 mmol h−1 g−1 under visible light irradiation (λ > 420 nm) and the apparent quantum yield was up to ∼14.9% at 450 nm.228 Zhu et al. prepared Co(OH)2 modified CdS nanowires via a facile impregnation synthetic method for enhanced photocatalytic H2 production. Under visible light (λ ≥ 420 nm) irradiation, the maximum H2 evolution rate achieved 14.43 mmol h−1 g−1 based on 6.5 mol% Co(OH)2/CdS NWs, which is about 3 times higher than that of Pt loaded CdS nanowires.229 More importantly, the typical core–shell structure formed during the photocatalytic H2 evolution reaction significantly improves the stability of Co(OH)2/CdS photocatalysts. A similar phenomenon was also observed by Wang's group.138 Although the above-mentioned cocatalysts are composed of noble-metal elements, they have the drawback of instability during the photocatalytic H2 generation reaction. Very recently, some transition metal phosphides have emerged and can be good candidates for co-catalysts, including FeP,230 CoxP,231 and Ni2P.232 These co-catalysts have demonstrated high activity for the photocatalytic H2 evolution reaction after they were combined with CdS because of their ability to reversibly bind hydrogen.
Although CdS is effective for harvesting visible light and photocatalytic H2 production, it exhibits a relatively limited visible light response range (shorter than 510 nm). To expand the light response of CdS, composite photocatalysts of CdS nanoparticles and boron nitride nanosheets (BNNSs) with a broad spectral response were prepared for efficient photocatalytic H2 evolution from water.233 The results showed that the boron nitride nanosheets not only broadened the visible light absorption region, but also provided effective electronic transport through the intimate contact between CdS nanoparticles and boron nitride nanosheets. The CdS loaded with only 0.5 wt% boron nitride nanosheets exhibited a H2 evolution rate of 439.4 μmol h−1 g−1, which is 2.3 times that of pure CdS. Furthermore, Co3O4 was also used as both a light-harvesting material and a cocatalyst to enhance the photocatalytic performance of CdS.234 Under visible light irradiation, the as-prepared Co3O4/CdS sample showed the highest photocatalytic H2 evolution rate of 3.014 mmol h−1 g−1 with an apparent quantum efficiency of 9.7% at 420 nm. This superior photocatalytic activity of Co3O4/CdS can be ascribed to the formation of p–n heterojunctions between p-type Co3O4 nanoparticles and n-type CdS nanorods, which facilitate the photogenerated charge separation and transfer (Fig. 11a) owing to the positive effect of the internal electric field (Fig. 11b). On the other hand, the visible light harvesting capacity of CdS-based photocatalysts was also enhanced by loading with Co3O4. Furthermore, loading plasmonic Au nanoparticles on CdS could improve the light-harvesting ability of CdS and then enhance the photocatalytic performance of CdS-based photocatalysts due to the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) of Au nanoparticles.235–237

In order to extend the absorption of CdS-based hybrid photocatalysts to the near-infrared region, up-conversion materials have been integrated into CdS. Liu et al. constructed a sandwich-structured NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+/Au/CdS architecture, as an up-conversion-involved photocatalyst for photocatalytic H2 production.238 As shown in Fig. 12, Yb3+ and Er3+ can engender up-conversion emission ranging from the ultraviolet to the near-infrared region upon near-infrared excitation. That is, the NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+ can act as a medium for transferring near-infrared light energy to ultraviolet or visible light. As expected, the optimized NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+/Au/CdS photocatalyst exhibited the highest H2 evolution rate of 590 μmol h−1 g−1 with an apparent quantum yield of 0.00089% under near-infrared light irradiation (λ > 700 nm).

In particular, titanium dioxide (TiO2) as one of the classical photocatalysts has been extensively investigated over the past 40 years owing to its low cost, high reactivity, nontoxicity and high durability.9 However, due to its wide band gap (∼3.2 eV), the currently used TiO2 is an inactive photocatalyst under visible light irradiation. Recent studies have shown that combining CdS with TiO2 would be an effective strategy to utilize visible light and promote photogenerated charge separation towards high photocatalytic performance for H2 production.239 Xue et al. reported that a series of Au@TiO2–CdS ternary photocatalysts prepared by decorating CdS nanoparticles onto Au@TiO2 core–shell structures exhibited much higher photocatalytic activity for H2 production under visible-light irradiation comparing to binary structures, such as Au@TiO2 and CdS–TiO2. The enhanced photocatalytic performance of Au@TiO2–CdS ternary photocatalysts is mainly attributed to the unique ternary structure, which provides an efficient transfer pathway for the photogenerated electrons of CdS to the Au cocatalyst through the TiO2 bridge, thus suppressing the recombination of electron–hole pairs on the CdS photocatalyst.240 Enhanced photocatalytic performance was also observed in other CdS sensitized TiO2 systems.241–246 In addition, Pal et al. reported that CdS can act as a sensitizer to improve the photocatalytic performance of ZnO.247 The synthesized ZnO/CdS composite photocatalyst exhibited the highest H2 evolution rate of 1007 μmol h−1 g−1 with an apparent quantum yield of 5.7%, which is much higher than those of both ZnO (154 μmol h−1 g−1) and CdS (208 μmol h−1 g−1). The same concept of enhanced photocatalytic activity of ZnO-based photocatalysts was also observed by Qureshi et al., by coupling CdS to ZnO.248 Similar results were also observed in other CdS sensitized ZnO systems.249–251
Furthermore, Hou et al. reported that enhanced photocatalytic H2 performance was achieved by using CdS sensitized TaON core–shell composites as the photocatalysts.252 The 1 wt% CdS/TaON photocatalyst exhibited a high H2 evolution rate of 1.53 mmol h−1 g−1 with an apparent quantum efficiency of 15% at 420 nm, which was 68 times higher than that of pure TaON. The H2 evolution rate was further improved to 3.165 mmol h−1 g−1 with a high apparent quantum efficiency of 31% at 420 nm when the CdS sensitized TaON was coupled with 1 wt% graphene oxide nanosheets and 0.4 wt% Pt, which is about 141 times the rate observed with pure TaON. The superior photocatalytic activity is attributed firstly to the presence of CdS that absorbs visible light for the photocatalytic H2 evolution reaction and secondly to the role of graphene oxide that acts as an efficient electron collector and transporter to prolong the lifetime of photogenerated charge from CdS@TaON composites (Table 2).

3.3 CdS-based solid solutions for solar H2 evolution
As noted above, the application of nanosized CdS for photocatalytic H2 production has attracted much attention. However, the practical application of CdS was limited by some drawbacks, such as the rapid charge recombination and photocorrosion under visible light irradiation. To overcome these challenges, forming ternary Zn–Cd–S solid solutions is supposed to be an effective strategy because ZnS exhibits the same crystal structure as CdS,253,254 and the bandgap and band edge position of Zn–Cd–S solid solutions can be efficiently tuned by changing their chemical composition.255–257 Therefore, the development of Zn–Cd–S solid solution photocatalysts is of great significance. So far, numerous methods have been explored to fabricate Zn–Cd–S solid solutions, including solvothermal,258 hydrothermal,259 biomolecule-assisted hydrothermal,260 and coprecipitation methods.261
Yu et al. prepared Zn1−xCdxS solid solutions by a simple thermolysis method by using Zn(Ac)2, Cd(Ac)2 and thiourea as the precursors. As shown in Fig. 13a, the synthesized Zn1−xCdxS solid solutions feature a remarkable red shift of the absorption edges with an increasing amount of Cd in the Zn1−xCdxS solid solutions, which is consistent with the color change of the Zn1−xCdxS from white to yellow (inset of Fig. 13a).262 The red shift of the absorption edges is associated with the tunable band gaps of the Zn1−xCdxS solid solution photocatalysts. Even without any cocatalyst, the synthesized Zn0.5Cd0.5S photocatalyst showed the highest H2 evolution rate of 7.42 mmol h−1 g−1 (Fig. 13b), which is about 54 and 24 times higher than that of pure ZnS and CdS samples, respectively, and even exceeds that of the optimal Pt-modified CdS photocatalyst. This surprising photocatalytic H2 evolution activity is mainly ascribed to the strong visible-light absorption capacity and matched conduction band level of the Zn0.5Cd0.5S sample. Furthermore, Qiao et al. found that the impurity level around the VB of Zn–Cd–S formed by doping with Cu2+ ions can facilitate charge transfer and enhance the visible-light response, resulting in enhanced photocatalytic H2 evolution.263

Although both the bandgap and the conduction band position of Cd1−xZnxS solid solution photocatalysts can be flexibly tuned by adjusting the value of x to improve the photocatalytic activity, the fast recombination of photogenerated charge in Cd1−xZnxS still remains a key challenge restricting the further enhancement of photocatalytic performance. For the purpose of restraining the rapid recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs to enhance the photocatalytic activity of Cd1−xZnxS solid solution photocatalysts, an efficient strategy is the introduction of a cocatalyst. Xu et al. found that the photocatalytic hydrogen production activity of Cd0.5Zn0.5S solid solution can be significantly enhanced by using metallic 1T-LixMoS2 as the cocatalyst.264 The optimal 1T-LixMoS2/Cd0.5Zn0.5S photocatalyst exhibited much higher photocatalytic H2 evolution activity as compared to bare Cd0.5Zn0.5S. More importantly, the 1T-LixMoS2/Cd0.5Zn0.5S nanojunctions also showed high durability, indicating that the 1T-LixMoS2 cocatalyst can also restrain the photocorrosion of Cd0.5Zn0.5S. Min et al. found that reduced graphene oxide can promote the photogenerated charge transfer from Cd0.5Zn0.5S to MoS2. Under visible light irradiation, the optimized Cd0.5Zn0.5S@MoS2/RGO sample exhibited the highest photocatalytic activity with a H2 evolution rate of 77 mmol h−1 g−1 and a long term stability (50 h). As determined by the electrochemical measurements and photoluminescence spectra, the stabilizing and improving photocatalytic H2 production is mainly ascribed to the dual photoexcited charge transfer process from Cd0.5Zn0.5S to RGO, and then to MoS2 due to an intimate interface.265 Furthermore, Pt,266 Ni,267 NiS,267 NiO,267 Ni(OH)2,267 CoS,268 Cu2S,269 RGO,270 and NiS/RGO271 can also act as active cocatalysts to enhance the photocatalytic H2 evolution performance of Zn–Cd–S solid solutions.
Recently, it was reported that some defects, such as sulfur vacancies, interstitial metals, and Zn and Cd in the low valence state on the top surface of solid solutions can also enhance the photocatalytic H2 production activities of Zn–Cd–S solid solutions.272 The surface defects can shift the valence band maximum and the conduction band minimum, forming a typical nanojunction between the bulk and surface of solid solution, which accelerates the migration of photogenerated charges to the surface of Zn–Cd–S and results in enhanced photocatalytic H2 evolution activity. Furthermore, reduced graphene oxide and onion-like carbon (OLC) nanoparticles can act not only as effective matrix materials for the growth of Zn–Cd–S solid solution nanoparticles but also as a cocatalyst to promote the separation of photogenerated charge, enhancing the photocatalytic H2 evolution activity.273,274 Furthermore, Xu et al. found that Cd1−xZnxS zinc blende/wurtzite (ZB/WZ) heterophase junctions can effectively promote the separation of photogenerated charge and achieve high photocatalytic H2 production.275 Even without any cocatalyst, the optimized Cd0.7Zn0.3S sample showed superior photocatalytic activity with a H2 evolution rate of 31.3 mmol h−1 g−1 under visible light irradiation and an apparent quantum yield of 65.7% at 420 nm. This cocatalyst-free Cd1−xZnxS showed much higher photocatalytic performance than MoS2/Cd1−xZnxS,264 Pt/Cd1−xZnxS,266 and Ni(OH)2/Cd1−xZnxS photocatalysts.267 As confirmed by the steady and time-resolved photoluminescence spectra, the internal electrostatic field related to the blende/wurtzite junctions can prolong the carrier lifetime and accelerate the charge separation, resulting in a high photocatalytic H2 evolution activity.
Some other strategies were also performed to improve the photocatalytic activity of Cd1−xZnxS solid solutions. For example, by controlling the morphologies of CdxZn1−xS,276 doping with metal,277 and incorporation of CdS and metal–organic framework materials,278–280 the photocatalytic activity of CdxZn1−xS can be enhanced to a certain degree. Apart from Zn–Cd–S solid solutions, other multi-component solid solutions, such as MnxCd1−xS,281–287 (CuIn)xCd2(1−x)S2,288 (Zn0.95Cu0.05)1−xCdxS,289 Zn1−xCdxIn2S4,290,291 and CdxCuyZn1−x−yS,292 were also designed and prepared for photocatalytic H2 production. Unfortunately, the photocatalytic performance of these multi-component solid solutions is still far from the basic requirement of practical application. Thus the development of novel strategies for the improvement of the photocatalytic performance of CdS-based solid solution photocatalysts is highly desired (Table 3).

3.4 CdS quantum dot photocatalysts for solar H2 generation
CdS powder with a controllable morphology, suitable band gaps and strong visible light absorption has been widely investigated as a photocatalyst for H2 evolution from water.170–252 However, one of the challenges in utilizing CdS powder photocatalysts is the low separation efficiency of the photogenerated charge carriers on CdS.171,293 CdS quantum dots (CdS QDs) have recently appeared at the forefront of photocatalytic H2 production. Unlike CdS powder, in which photogenerated charge carriers can undergo trap-mediated recombination that hinders migration to the surface, the large surface-to-volume ratios and quantum confinement effect of CdS QDs remarkably strengthen the surface amplitude of charge carriers, which promotes the separation of electron–hole pairs.
Wu et al. found that nickel-hybrid CdS quantum dots (Nih-CdS QDs) formed in situ from 3-mercaptopropionic acid stabilize CdS QDs (MPA-CdS QDs) and Ni2+ ions can act as an efficient artificial photocatalyst for visible-light photocatalytic H2 production from water.294 Under visible light irradiation, the Nih-CdS QDs exhibited superior photocatalytic activity with a highest H2 evolution rate of 74.6 mmol h−1 g−1, and the turnover number with respect to Nih-CdS QDs and the apparent quantum yield at 410 nm were up to 38405 and 12.2%, respectively. The proposed photocatalytic H2 evolution processes are shown in Fig. 14. The electrons located in the VB of CdS are excited to the CB under visible light irradiation, accompanied by the creation of holes in the VB. The photoexcited electrons were transferred to the Ni2+-centered complex through the Ni–S coordinate bonds, and then reduced H+ to generate H2. The holes in the VB of CdS can be trapped by H2O or OH− on the surface of Nih-CdS QDs to generate ˙OH radicals, which can be consumed by glycerol.

To investigate the photoinduced charge carrier transfer between CdS QDs and catalysts, Li et al. constructed a hybrid photocatalytic H2 production system comprised of CdS quantum dots and [Co(III)(dmgH)2PyCl] to investigate the charge transfer mechanism from CdS quantum dots to the molecular catalyst.295 As demonstrated by the electron paramagnetic resonance spectra, time-resolved photoluminescence and UV-vis absorption, the single-step simultaneous two-electron transfer from CdS quantum dots to the [Co(III)(dmgH)2PyCl] catalyst is the key process for enabling the photocatalytic H2 production in the CdS/[Co(III)(dmgH)2PyCl] system.
Zhang et al. prepared water-soluble MS2-CdS (M = W or Mo) nanohybrid photocatalysts for enhanced photocatalytic H2 production.296 As shown in Fig. 15a and b, the size of MoS2/CdS and WS2/CdS nanohybrids was estimated to be 4–10 and 6–10 nm, respectively. It is noted that the MS2 nanosheets with a size of 4–10 nm can intimately grow on the Cd-rich (0001) surface of CdS nanoparticles. Under visible light irradiation (λ > 420 nm), the photocatalytic activities of MoS2/CdS and WS2/CdS nanohybrids for H2 production are about 12 and 16 times that of bare CdS, respectively (Fig. 15c). More importantly, the MS2/CdS nanohybrid photocatalysts showed improved stability. The enhanced photocatalytic performance and improved durability of these MS2-CdS nanohybrids were mainly ascribed to the abundant edge sites in the MS2 nanosheets, which are active sites for the hydrogen evolution reaction (Fig. 15d). Xu et al. constructed a highly efficient photocatalytic H2 production system by using CdS QDs as the light-harvesting material and MoP nanoparticles as the cocatalyst.297 Under optimized conditions, the highest H2 evolution rate of 1.1 mmol h−1 and an apparent quantum yield of 45% at 460 nm were obtained. The high photocatalytic activity of this system was mainly ascribed to both the metallic characteristics of MoP and the rapid electron transfer from CdS to MoP.

The use of CdS QDs is restricted by their photocorrosion problem. To improve the stability of CdS QDs, Kale et al. prepared a CdS quantum dots-GeO2 glass photocatalyst by growing CdS QDs in the GeO2 glass. The CdS quantum dots-GeO2 glass composite is stable and easily regenerated for photocatalytic H2 production as compared to other normal CdS QD photocatalysts.298 Martha et al. found that decorating CdS QDs in BiOI microplates can efficiently improve the photocatalytic activity and stability of CdS QDs owing to the delayed recombination of charge carriers.299 Recent research studies have demonstrated that building core/shell structures by overgrowing a suitable semiconductor on a CdS core is an efficient method to improve the photocatalytic performance and the stability of CdS QDs for photocatalytic H2 production. Li et al. found that a ZnS shell grown on CdS NC cores can restrain the photocorrosion and passivate the trap states on CdS QDs.300 Furthermore, Wu et al. found that heterostructured CdS/CdSe QDs can be tailored by electron and hole wave functions to obtain outstanding charge separation and light harvesting, resulting in an enhanced photocatalytic activity.301 Incorporating CdS QDs onto a support material is an efficient method to improve the separation efficiency of photogenerated electron–hole pairs. Xu et al. reported the preparation of CdS QD modified Ga2O3/In2O3 photocatalysts for photocatalytic H2 production from water. With Pt as the cocatalyst, CdS/Pt/Ga2O3 and CdS/Pt/In2O3 showed high photocatalytic performance with a H2 evolution rate of 9958 and 1032 μmol h−1 g−1, respectively, which are much higher than those of Pt/Ga2O3 (1.2 μmol h−1 g−1) and Pt/In2O3 (0.5 μmol h−1 g−1) photocatalysts. The apparent quantum efficiencies of 43.6 and 45.3% were obtained at 460 nm for CdS/Pt/Ga2O3 and CdS/Pt/In2O3 photocatalysts, respectively.302 To develop efficient CdS QD-based photocatalysts without Pt co-catalysts, Xu et al. fabricated a ternary CdS/WC/TiO2 photocatalyst by supporting CdS QDs and WC on TiO2 for visible-light-driven photocatalytic H2 production. The CdS/WC/TiO2 composite exhibited a comparable photocatalytic activity (17.854 mmol h−1 g−1) with that of CdS/Pt/TiO2 (15.905 mmol h−1 g−1), suggesting that WC is an appropriate candidate to replace Pt as the co-catalyst.303 Shi et al. constructed a novel 0D–2D CdS/ZnO heterojunction by using the successive ionic layer absorption and reaction method. The obtained 0D–2D CdS/ZnO photocatalyst presented significantly enhanced photocatalytic performance for H2 production with the highest H2 evolution rate of 22.12 mmol h−1 g−1, which was about 138 times and 13 times higher than that of ZnO (0.16 mmol h−1 g−1) and CdS (1.68 mmol h−1 g−1), respectively.304 An enhanced electron–hole recombination and photocatalytic performance were also observed for 0D–2D CdS quantum dot coated Zn–Cr-layered double hydroxide (Zn–CrLDH) nanosheet photocatalysts (Table 4).305

3.5 Developing novel strategies to improve the stability of CdS-based photocatalysts
Over the past 40 years, much progress has been made in understanding the fundamental carrier dynamics and reaction mechanism of CdS-based photocatalysts for H2 production in a half-reaction system. A superior high apparent quantum yield up to 93% at 420 nm has been observed for Pt–PdS/CdS photocatalysts.161 Recently, highly efficient noble-metal-free CdS-based photocatalysts, such as MoS2/CdS,195,196 MoS2-RGO/CdS,201 Ni(OH)2/CdS,306etc., were also developed successfully. However, most reported CdS-based photocatalysts suffer from poor stability owing to the photocorrosion phenomenon of CdS. That is, S2− in CdS can be oxidized by photogenerated valence band holes, resulting in the dissolution of Cd2+ ions.307 To the best of our knowledge, currently there are three main methods that can be adopted to improve the photostability of CdS photocatalysts given as follows:
(1) Employing a sacrificial reagent to consume photogenerated holes. CdS seriously suffers from photocorrosion under light illumination, which is related to the self-oxidation of S2− in CdS by photogenerated holes before the oxidation of water. Obviously, effectively taking photogenerated holes away from the VB of CdS would hinder the oxidation of S2−, thus improving the photostability of CdS. It is widely believed that the use of sacrificial reagents (such as lactic acid, ethanol, Na2S–Na2SO3 pairs, etc.,) as the electron donors for CdS in photocatalytic H2 production systems has been considered as one of the efficient strategies to improve the stability of CdS. Although there is no study regarding the effect of sacrificial reagents on the photostability of CdS, some important trend about the photostability of CdS can be summarized for those photocatalytic systems in the presence of various sacrificial reagents. That is, the CdS photocatalyst exhibited a better stability in the presence of Na2S and Na2SO3 as the sacrificial agent, whereas it exhibited a relatively poor stability in the presence of either ethanol or lactic acid as the sacrificial reagent. For example, Feng et al. reported that hexagonal-cubic core–shell architecture CdS with a nanorod morphology showed excellent photocatalytic stability for H2 production in Na2S–Na2SO3 solution even under aerobic conditions as confirmed by the stability test over 100 h.308 Instead, Yin et al. found that there was an obvious decline in the hydrogen evolution activity after the stability test over 24 h for the CdS photocatalyst in the presence of lactic acid as the sacrificial reagent. The TEM and XPS analysis demonstrated that the main reason for the decline in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity is the photocorrosion of CdS.196 The better stability of CdS photocatalysts in Na2S–Na2SO3 solution could be assigned to the fact that the S2− anions can suppress the oxidation of S2− in CdS.
(2) Constructing homojunctions/heterojunctions to prevent the photocorrosion of CdS. Generally, the photocorrosion of CdS can be overcome by constructing homojunctions/heterojunctions due to the improved separation efficiency of photogenerated charge at the CdS surface.309–311 For instance, Lu et al. constructed an oriented built-in electric-field in a gradient phosphorus-doped CdS homojunction nanostructure for efficient extraction of photogenerated charge from inside to the surface of CdS.312 Even without any cocatalyst, the CdS photocatalyst exhibited excellent photostability and high performance with the highest H2 evolution rate of 94.3 mmol h−1 g−1 and an apparent quantum yield of 8.2% at 420 nm, which is about 58.3 and 9.7 times higher than that of pure CdS and 0.5% Pt/CdS, respectively. Huang et al. prepared a CdS/g-C3N4 core/shell nanowire heterojunction with enhanced photocatalytic activity and intensified photostability, and the progress could be related to the synergic effect between g-C3N4 and CdS originating from their well-matched overlapping band structures.313 That is, a strong interfacial electric field between CdS and g-C3N4 formed by the band-edge offset can effectively accelerate the separation of photogenerated charge carriers because the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels of g-C3N4 are higher than the CB and VB levels of CdS, respectively. The photogenerated electrons in the LUMO of g-C3N4 can be readily injected into the CB of CdS, while the photogenerated holes in the VB of CdS can directly transfer to the HOMO of g-C3N4, accelerating the charge separation and transfer of corrosive holes from CdS to robust C3N4. The rapid separation of holes plays a key role in improving the photostability of CdS. So far, CdS has been coupled with various semiconductors (NiTiO3,314 TiO2,242 ZnO,315,316 Ta2O5,317 ZnS,318 WO3,319 Bi2S3,320 CdLa2S4,321etc.) or noble metals,168,322 to form heterojunctions, and a relatively high stability has been obtained in these heterojunction photocatalysts.
(3) Loading hole-trapping materials on CdS photocatalysts to promote hole transfer and separation. Coating a suitable hole-trapping material on the surface of CdS is also an efficient and important strategy to hinder the photocorrosion of CdS photocatalysts, owing to the positive role of hole-trapping materials in accelerating the transfer and separation of photogenerated holes. For example, Alivisatos et al. designed and synthesized a spatially controlled nanoheterostructure composed of a platinum-tipped CdS rod with an embedded CdSe seed.323 In this novel heterostructure, the photogenerated holes are three-dimensionally confined to the CdSe, whereas the delocalized electrons are transferred to the metal tip. Consequently, the electrons are now separated from the holes over the three different components and this heterostructure demonstrated improved stability compared to CdS rods without a CdSe seed. Li et al. found that the photostability and photocatalytic H2 production activity of CdS could be efficiently improved by loading PdS as a hole-trapping material and Pt as an electron cocatalyst.161 More importantly, the PdS component can act as an efficient cocatalyst for the oxidation of the sacrificial reagent, resulting in a superior photocatalytic activity for H2 production. Zhang et al. also reported the positive effect of PdS in preventing the photocorrosion of CdS photocatalysts.324
Although the above-reported PdS and CdSe are efficient hole-trapping materials, they are both environmentally unfriendly and expensive, thus largely limiting their practical applications. It is very necessary to develop highly efficient, environmentally friendly and economical hole-trapping materials. Yu et al. reported that the photoinduced stability of CdS can be significantly improved by loading amorphous TiO2 (Ti(IV)) as a hole-trapping center on the CdS surface (Fig. 16).325 It is well known that bare CdS suffers from poor photocatalytic activity and low stability during the photocatalytic H2 evolution reaction (Fig. 16a). Although loading amorphous TiO2 on the CdS surface can improve the stability of CdS, the designed Ti(IV)/CdS exhibited a limited enhancement of photocatalytic performance due to the lack of a hydrogen evolution reaction cocatalyst (Fig. 16b). Owing to the fact that the Ni(II) compound can enhance the photocatalytic activity of CdS (Fig. 16c), amorphous Ni(II) was further modified on the TiO2/CdS composite surface to improve the photocatalytic performance of the TiO2/CdS composite. As a consequence, both the photostability and the photocatalytic performance of CdS can be efficiently improved by simultaneous modification of amorphous TiO2 and the Ni(II) compound (Fig. 16d), which could be attributed to the synergistic effect of amorphous TiO2 as a trapping material and the Ni(II) compound as a H2 evolution reaction cocatalyst.

In addition to the above three methods, the introduction of a protective coating or an electron mediator can also improve the stability of CdS. Recent, Hu et al. found that the photostability of CdS can be efficiently improved by doping with Cu+ and coating with C (Fig. 17a–e).326 The TEM (Fig. 17a and b) and elemental mapping analysis (Fig. 17c–e) results indicate the successful preparation of carbon-coated Cu+-doped CdS nanocomposites. As shown in Fig. 16f, the photocurrent experiment revealed that the doped Cu+ and coated C leads to a rapid transport of charge carriers, thus inhibiting the photocorrosion of the CdS photocatalyst. On the other hand, the carbon layer acted as a protective coating for the CdS core which can prevent the photocorrosion of CdS. The good stability of the photocatalyst is evidenced by cycle runs for photocatalytic H2 evolution as illustrated in Fig. 17g. Furthermore, the photostability of CdS can be also improved by coating with amorphous carbon327 or polymeric materials, such as conducting polyaniline,328 polystyrene-divinylbenzene resin,329 and polydimethylsilicone.330 Furthermore, Du et al. found that nickel hydroxide-modified cadmium sulfide/reduced graphene oxide (Ni(OH)2–CdS/rGO) nanocomposites exhibited photostability for photocatalytic H2 production. In such a smart structure, the graphene component can be used as an efficient electron transfer channel to accelerate the photogenerated charge transfer from CdS to Ni(OH)2, resulting in excellent stability of the photocatalyst.331 A similar observation was made in other photocatalytic systems using graphene as an electron mediator.332

4. Summary and outlook
This review summarized the recent progress made in developing highly efficient CdS-based photocatalysts for visible-light-driven H2 production from water. Numerous studies have stated clearly that CdS and CdS-based composites can act as efficient photocatalysts for visible light driven photocatalytic H2 generation, which can be attributed to the strong visible light absorption as well as suitable energy positions of conduction and valence bands for photocatalytic reactions. Although photocatalytic H2 production over CdS-based photocatalysts has been studied for nearly 40 years, there still exist many critical challenges in this field. Some issues are listed as follows:
(1) Inhibition of the photocorrosion of CdS-based photocatalysts. CdS has been considered as a promising visible-light-responsive photocatalyst for hydrogen production owing to its desired band-gap and suitable band-edge positions.220–230 However, before the CdS photocatalyst can become practically useful in large-scale photocatalytic hydrogen generation, its photocatalytic stability should be improved. As frequently reported, CdS seriously suffers from photocorrosion under light illumination. The S2− anions in CdS tend to be self-oxidized by photogenerated holes before the oxidation of water. It has been demonstrated that loading suitable dual cocatalysts on CdS and constructing heterojunctions can accelerate the photogenerated charge carrier transfer and migration, inhibiting the photocorrosion process to some extent, but the stability of CdS-based photocatalysts is still far from the basic requirement of practical application. Therefore, exploring novel strategies to further improve the stability of CdS-based photocatalysts is a key and urgent challenge as well as an opportunity to develop highly efficient photocatalysts for photocatalytic H2 production.
(2) Construction of CdS-based photocatalytic overall water splitting systems. To date, most CdS-based H2-evolution photocatalysts have been active in a water reduction half-reaction system, which required extra sacrificial electron donors (such as methanol, ethanol, ascorbic acid, lactic acid and Na2S/Na2S2O3 pairs).231–233 Although the fundamental reaction pathway and mechanism for H2 evolution can be efficiently recognized in such a system, the H2-evolution half-reaction system is meaningless from the practical application point of view because it consumes high-cost sacrificial electron donors. Therefore, it is highly desirable to construct CdS-based photocatalytic overall water splitting systems. Inspired by previously reported studies,90,333–339 there are two potential photosynthetic approaches for the construction of CdS-based overall water splitting systems. As shown in Fig. 17a, the first approach is the development of a single CdS photocatalyst which can act as both a H2-generation photocatalyst and an O2-generation photocatalyst. Bare CdS has sufficient thermodynamic driving force to achieve overall water splitting. Loading both a H2-generation cocatalyst and an O2-generation cocatalyst on the surface of CdS would be an efficient strategy to accelerate the photogenerated charge carrier transfer and migration. Actually, in 1981, the model of a CdS-based photocatalytic overall water splitting system as illustrated in Fig. 18a has been successfully constructed by using Pt and RuO2 as a hydrogen generation cocatalyst and an oxygen generation cocatalyst, respectively.162 However, after that this photocatalytic water splitting system is scarcely reported. In the future, the ingenious design and synthesis of novel CdS-based photocatalysts will be a great challenge for photocatalytic overall water splitting.

The second approach is the construction of a Z-scheme photocatalytic overall water splitting system. As shown in Fig. 18b, the Z-scheme system typically consists of a H2-generation photocatalyst, an O2-generation photocatalyst, and an electron mediator. Although CdS is a highly efficient photocatalyst for H2 production in half-reaction systems,208–228 the use of CdS in the Z-scheme photocatalytic over water splitting system is scarcely reported. Recently, we have constructed an efficient Z-scheme photocatalytic overall water splitting system by using MoS2/CdS as the H2-generation photocatalyst, Co3O4/BiVO4 as the O2-generation photocatalyst, and the [Co(bpy)3]3+/[Co(bpy)3]2+ redox couple as an electron mediator under visible light irradiation.340 Although MoS2/CdS and Co3O4/BiVO4 have been proven to be an efficient H2-generation photocatalyst and O2-generation photocatalyst in half-reaction systems, respectively,184–198,341 unfortunately, the Z-scheme system exhibited low photocatalytic performance for water splitting with a low apparent quantum yield of 1.04% at 420 nm, which could be ascribed to the poor carrier separation efficiency. Therefore, the suppression of backward reactions is a challenge as well as an opportunity to the development of highly efficient CdS-based Z-scheme photocatalytic overall water splitting systems. Currently, the use of CdS for the construction of Z-scheme photocatalytic overall water splitting systems is just at the beginning stage. In the future, further studies on understanding the interfacial carrier dynamics and improving the solar-to-H2 conversion efficiency and stability of CdS-based Z-scheme photocatalytic over water splitting systems will be needed.
