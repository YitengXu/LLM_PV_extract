Enzyme biofuel cells (EBFCs) have been attracting worldwide attention in recent years because of their ability to convert chemical or biochemical energy into electrical energy by making use of body fluids and thus they can serve as an implantable power source.1–4 The development of an effective bioelectrocatalytic system for glucose oxidation and oxygen reduction was highly desirable for EBFCs, in which the electrical contact of the enzyme with the substrate electrode was the key process.5 Different methods to facilitate the electrical communication between enzymes and the electrode were reported, such as the use of electron transfer mediators,6 reconstitution of apo-enzymes on relay-cofactor units,7 and entrapment of the enzyme in the conductive polymers.8 Recently, the development of conductive nanomaterials as effective scaffolds to electrically contact enzymes with electrodes has aroused intense interest,9–11 among which, carbon nanomaterials, especially carbon nanotubes (CNTs), exhibited excellent capability for catalysis due to their large surface for enzyme immobilization and high electrical conductivity for electron transfer.12,13 Furthermore, many studies demonstrated that carbon nanomaterials doped with nitrogen could greatly improve the stability of the resultant catalysts because they could enrich free charge-carrier densities, enhance p bonding in the framework and promote their electron donor–acceptor properties.14–17 Particularly, it has been reported that enhanced biocompatibility and sensitivity was achieved by N-doped CNTs and graphene in biosensing applications.17–19 Recently, graphitic carbon nitride nanosheets (g-C3N4 NSs) have become a very promising class of carbon materials due to their high N content, low cost, and tunable structure.20,21 However, the poor conductivity of g-C3N4 NSs limited their performance in the construction of electrochemical sensors. Several attempts have been made to improve their conductivity, such as the combination of g-C3N4 NSs with conductive carbon materials to fabricate multifunctional hybrid,22–25 which has been used as a photocatalyst for energy conversion,24,26–28 as an electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction and evolution reaction,23,29 and in lithium-ion batteries.30 However, so far only a few studies have been aimed at researching the enhancement of bioelectrocatalysis reactions of enzymes.
In this communication, we developed a convenient strategy to synthesize a ternary hybrid of CNTs/g-C3N4 NSs/gold nanoparticles (CNTs/g-C3N4 NSs/Au NPs) through π–π stacking and electrostatic interaction, and employed the ternary hybrid as substrate electrodes for EBFCs (Scheme 1). In brief, CNTs and g-C3N4 NSs were assembled using a simple sonication method to obtain CNTs/g-C3N4 NSs nanocomposite, in which no chemical functionalization of CNTs was required and no organic solvents, toxic chemicals and surfactants were involved. The ternary hybrid was obtained by decorating the carboxyl-functionalized Au NPs in the CNTs/g-C3N4 NSs nanocomposite through electrostatic interaction, which could be used to bond the enzyme molecules through a condensation reaction between the amino groups in the enzyme structure and the carboxyl groups on the Au NPs. In our study, pyrroloquinoline quinone-dependent glucose dehydrogenase (PQQ-GDH) was used for the catalytic oxidation of glucose because no soluble cofactor was required during the reaction. More importantly, the biocatalytic reaction was not affected by oxygen. Meanwhile, bilirubin oxidase (BOD) had a high stability and activity at neutral pH, and thus it was selected to catalyze the reduction of oxygen. In this case, we developed a novel membrane-less and mediator-less glucose/O2 EBFC based on the enzyme-modified CNTs/g-C3N4 NSs/Au NPs ternary hybrid electrode (Scheme 1). Compared with the EBFC based on the same enzyme-modified CNTs/Au NPs electrode, its maximum power output was remarkably improved, which suggested that the introduction of g-C3N4 NSs into CNTs/Au NPs had proved to be effective.
 Scheme 1  Schematic illustration of assembly of the ternary hybrid and fabrication of the membrane-less and mediator-less glucose/O2 EBFC. 
Firstly, the protonated g-C3N4 NSs were prepared by refluxing the bulk g-C3N4, which is stated in the ESI.† The morphology of the obtained g-C3N4 NSs was characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and showed a two-dimensional thin-layered structure (Fig. S1†), which indicated the successful exfoliation of bulk g-C3N4. Afterwards, a certain amount of CNTs were added into the protonated g-C3N4 NSs, and then the mixture was sonicated to obtain a uniform and opaque black solution, followed by microwave heating. The sonication and the hydrothermal aging process favored the homogenous assembly of g-C3N4 NSs and CNTs through π–π stacking interaction, in which g-C3N4 NSs performed as a superior dispersant like graphene oxide to disperse pristine CNTs into water to form stable suspensions through supra-molecular interactions.31,32 As shown in Fig. 1A and B, CNTs and g-C3N4 NSs were well dispersed in each other with interpenetration and porous architecture. The incorporated CNTs served as a three-dimensional electric network, which substantially facilitated the electron transfer. Finally, the ternary hybrid of CNTs/g-C3N4 NSs/Au NPs was prepared through electrostatic interaction, showing a uniform decoration of gold nanoparticles around 10 nm as displayed in Fig. 1C and D. In addition, a series of control nanomaterials were prepared, including CNTs, g-C3N4 NSs, CNTs/g-C3N4 NSs nanocomposite, and CNTs/Au NPs, all of which showed good dispersion as well as high uniformity (Fig. S2 and S3†).

The assembly process of CNTs/g-C3N4 NSs/Au NPs ternary hybrid was characterized. In the XRD patterns of Fig. S4A,† the characteristic peaks of the ternary hybrid were respectively attributed to g-C3N4 (13.3° and 27.4°),23 CNTs (26.3°), and Au NPs (38.0°, 44.2°, 64.5° and 77.4°), indicating the successful formation of the homogenous hybrid structure. The variations of surface charges during the assembly were monitored using zeta-potentials in Fig. S4B.† The zeta-potentials of the protonated g-C3N4 NSs and CNTs were respectively +48.66 mV and −17.8 mV, which promoted their π–π stacking interaction via electrostatic attraction to obtain the uniform CNTs/g-C3N4 NSs nanocomposite. The subsequent absorption of the positively charged polymer PDDA onto the surface of CNTs/g-C3N4 NSs nanocomposite changed its zeta-potential from +4.5 mV to +40.9 mV (e), facilitating the electrostatic decoration of the negatively charged Au NPs. The obtained negatively charged ternary hybrid demonstrated the successful electrostatic adsorption of Au NPs (g). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was further used to demonstrate the strong coupling between the g-C3N4 NSs and CNTs in the nanocomposite (Fig. S4C†). The XPS survey spectrum shows that the CNTs/g-C3N4 NSs nanocomposite contains C, N, and O atoms with a high N content of 41.26 ± 0.41 atomic percentages (at%), which is consistent with the results of elemental analysis. The high-resolution XPS of C and N in g-C3N4 NSs and the CNTs/g-C3N4 NSs nanocomposite showed distinct profiles (Fig. S5†). The C1s spectrum of both the CNTs/g-C3N4 NSs nanocomposite and g-C3N4 NSs could be deconvoluted into the sp2-bonded C atoms (288.0 eV) and the CC (284.6 eV) species.28 Nevertheless, the percentage of CC species in the g-C3N4 NSs/CNTs nanocomposite (Fig. S5B†) was much larger than that in the g-C3N4 NSs (Fig. S5A†). Specifically, the high-resolution XPS spectrum for N1s in the g-C3N4 NSs could be fitted into two peaks at 398.5 and 400.0 eV (Fig. S5C†), corresponding to the pyridinic N species in triazine rings (C–NC) and tertiary N species or N atoms bonded with H atoms. However, in the CNTs/g-C3N4 NSs nanocomposite, the N1s formed a new shoulder peak at 397.6 eV (Fig. S5D†), which was caused by the strong interaction between the CNTs and the N atoms in the g-C3N4 NSs.33 Moreover, as shown in the Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra, the CNTs/g-C3N4 NSs nanocomposite (Fig. S4D(b)†) and the ternary hybrid (Fig. S4D(c)†) both reveal the characteristic bands for the CN heterocycle stretching vibration (800–1600 cm−1). Notably, a new band centered at approximately 1730 cm−1 in the ternary hybrid (Fig. S4D(c)†) was ascribed to the presence of carboxyl groups on the Au NPs.
Based on the porous architecture and high N content of CNTs/g-C3N4 NSs/Au NPs ternary hybrid, we developed a membrane-less and mediator-less glucose/O2 EBFC. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was first performed in order to understand the influence of the semiconductor g-C3N4 NSs on the conductivity of the ternary hybrid. As shown in Fig. S6,† the charge-transfer resistance (Rct) of the bare CP substrate electrode was 310 Ω (Fig. S6A(a)†). After the modification with the CNTs/g-C3N4 NSs/Au NPs ternary hybrid, the Rct drastically fell to 10 Ω (Fig. S6A(b)†), and even equaled that of the electrode modified with CNTs/Au NPs (Fig. S6B(b)†), indicating that the excellent conductive capability of the ternary hybrid with a homogenous composition and three-dimensional architecture significantly facilitated the electron transfer. When the electrode was further functionalized with PQQ-GDH or BOD, the enzyme-modified ternary hybrid electrode showed an elevated Rct (Fig. S6(c and d)†) due to the steric hindrance of the enzyme for the approach of the redox probes to the electrode surface, confirming the successful assembly of enzymes on the electrodes.
To demonstrate that the PQQ-GDH modified ternary hybrid electrode as a bioanode possessed bioelectrocatalysis for glucose oxidation, the cyclic voltammetry (CV) of the enzyme electrode was performed in PBS (pH = 7.4) containing 5 mM glucose. With the immobilization of PQQ-GDH, obvious bioelectrocatalytic current (Fig. 2A and Fig. S7A,† curve b) appeared in the enzyme-modified ternary hybrid electrode, which was similar to that reported by Katz's group.2 In comparison, a smaller current was also observed in the PQQ-GDH modified CP/CNTs/Au NPs electrode (curve d), suggesting that the ternary hybrid efficiently improved the bioelectrocatalytic activity of the enzyme. Thus, when 1 μA cm−2 of the anodic current density was produced, the potential of the glucose oxidation was −0.18 V at the PQQ-GDH modified ternary hybrid bioanode, while 0 V at the PQQ-GDH modified CP/CNTs/Au NPs bioanode (Fig. S7A†), further indicating that the glucose oxidation at the ternary hybrid bioanode was much easier. Similarly, at the same potential (0.4 V) for glucose oxidation, the anodic current density produced at the ternary hybrid bioanode reached a higher value (323 μA cm−2) than that at the CNTs/Au NPs bioanode (239 μA cm−2), leading to the inference that g-C3N4 NSs in the ternary hybrid bioanode played a vital role in promoting the bioelectrocatalytic activity of PQQ-GDH. On the other hand, similar electrocatalytic behaviors were observed, shown in Fig. 2B and Fig. S7B† when the BOD-modified ternary hybrid electrode was used as the biocathode in PBS (pH = 7.4, saturated with O2). When 1 μA cm−2 of the cathodic current density was produced, the potential of the oxygen reduction was 0.55 V at the BOD-modified ternary hybrid biocathode, and 0.43 V at the BOD-modified CP/CNTs/Au NPs biocathode (Fig. S7B†). Meanwhile, at the same potential for oxygen reduction, the cathodic current density at the BOD-modified ternary hybrid biocathode (101 μA cm−2, at 0.1 V) was much larger than that at the BOD-modified CP/CNTs/Au NPs bioanode (56 μA cm−2, at 0.1 V). All these results obtained from the biocathode demonstrated that the introduction the g-C3N4 NSs to CNTs/Au NPs resulted in a better electrocatalytic activity of BOD for oxygen reduction. As the blank control, in the absence of glucose or oxygen, CVs exhibited no bioelectrocatalytic current at PQQ-GDH or BOD-modified ternary hybrid electrode (Fig. S8†).

Scan rate = 50 mV s−1. 
To investigate the influence of g-C3N4 NSs on the electrocatalytic current density of glucose oxidation and oxygen reduction, the electrocatalytic current density of enzyme-modified different electrode compositions was examined. Fig. S9† shows a plot of the anodic and cathodic current densities at different mass percentage (wt%) values of g-C3N4 NSs in the CNTs/g-C3N4 NSs nanocomposite. Both anodic and cathodic current density increased initially with the increase in the mass percentage of g-C3N4 NSs, and the maximum value was obtained when the mass percentage approached 50 wt%. Then, the current density decreased with the further increase of the g-C3N4 NSs, especially when the mass percentage was more than 76.6%. An explanation for the above phenomenon could be that the abundant electron-rich pyridinic N and tertiary N species (shown in Fig. S5†) in the CNTs/g-C3N4 NSs nanocomposite provided a high level of electronic state density and sufficient free electrons, which enhanced the electron transfer efficiency and facilitated the electrocatalysis of the enzyme system.17 However, excess g-C3N4 NSs would significantly reduce the conductivity of the hybrid and clog the porous architecture (Fig. S2F and G†) which hindered the electron transfer and led to the decrease in current.
As mentioned above, the introduction of g-C3N4 NSs in the ternary hybrid could obviously enhance the electrocatalytic activity of enzyme electrodes. Therefore, PQQ-GDH and BOD modified ternary hybrid electrodes were respectively selected as the bioanode and the biocathode for the fabrication of the membrane-less glucose/O2 EBFC. Before the EBFC assembly, a possible crossover between the bioanode and the biocathode was examined. As shown in Fig. S10,† there was no change in the voltammetric response at the bioanode in the presence of O2 (A and C), and so it was at the biocathode in the presence of glucose (B and D). These results implied that no crossover reaction occurred in the prepared EBFC, making it possible to assemble one-compartment glucose/O2 EBFCs. Fig. 3A (curve a) shows that the open current voltage (EOCV) of the prepared EFBC could reach 0.55 ± 0.03 V in 0.10 M PBS (pH = 7.4, saturated with O2) containing 5 mM glucose. In comparison, EOCV of the control EBFC based on CNTs/Au NPs electrodes modified with the same enzyme was only 0.43 ± 0.05 V (curve b in Fig. 3A), showing an increase in EOCV for the prepared membrane-less glucose/O2 EBFC. The power output of the prepared EBFC is shown in Fig. 3B (curve a). The maximum power density (Pmax) reached 249 ± 4.2 μW cm−2, which was 3.3 times greater than Pmax (76 ± 3.5 μW cm−2) of the control EBFC (curve b in Fig. 3B). A similar phenomenon was also observed in the maximum current density (jmax), which was increased by nearly 2 times (Fig. S11†). The data correspond to the average value of three independent measurements. The relative standard deviations (RSDs) of EOCV and Pmax of the prepared EBFCs were 5.45% and 1.69%, respectively, which were both within the error limit allowed. The blank control with no fuels of EBFC was also performed. As shown in the curve c in Fig. 3 and Fig. S11,† compared with the prepared EBFC, the EOCV, Pmax and jmax values of the blank control EBFC could almost be neglected.

(c) Ternary hybrid based EBFCs in the nitrogen-saturated 0.1 M PBS (pH = 7.4) containing 0 mM of glucose. Every point corresponds to the average value of three independent measurements. 
The outstanding performance of the ternary hybrid based EBFCs originated for several reasons. First, the high content of electron-rich pyridinic N and tertiary N could form a high level electronic state density and sufficient quantity of free electrons in the ternary hybrid, which resulted in the enhancement of electron transfer and facilitated the bioelectrocatalysis of the enzyme system. Second, the strong combination of highly conductive CNTs with g-C3N4 rendered the ternary hybrid excellent electron conductivity as well as good porous architecture, which significantly improved the electron transfer in a three-dimensional structure.12 Third, the uniform distribution of the carboxyl functionalized Au NPs modified in the porous architecture favored the homogenous enzyme immobilization in their optimal positioning at the electrodes, which further promoted the electrical communication between the enzyme and the electrode.7,34 In addition, in order to evaluate the stability of the prepared EBFC, Pmax of the EBFC was tested every day. The fuels in the EBFC were replaced every 5 days. After 30 days, it had only a 27% loss in contrast to its original Pmax (Fig. S12,† curve a). As a control, the power output had a loss of 38% for the EBFC based on the CNTs/Au NPs in the same conditions (Fig. S12,† curve b), which implied that the combination of g-C3N4 NSs with CNTs/Au NPs could also enhance the stability of the EBFC. Future progress will require further improvement to extend its practical applications, such as a higher power output, miniaturization of the device, anti-fouling ability, and better stability of the EBFC.
A novel CNTs/g-C3N4 NSs/Au NPs ternary hybrid was synthesized using a convenient π–π stacking interaction and electrostatic adsorption strategy, and was used to develop a membrane-less and mediator-less glucose/O2 EBFC. The outstanding performance of the ternary hybrid based EBFC originated from its high content of electron-rich pyridinic N and tertiary N, good porous architecture, excellent conductivity, as well as the uniform distribution of the biocompatible Au NPs in the ternary hybrid. Therefore, the introduction of g-C3N4 NSs to CNTs/Au NPs was proven to be effective for improving the performance of glucose/O2 EBFC.
