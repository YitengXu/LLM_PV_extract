    , Accepted 12th January 2023First published on 12th January 2023AbstractAiming at the comprehensive utilization of waste carbon resources and renewable carbon resources, we put forward the photocatalytic coupling process of CO2 reduction and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF) oxidation mediated by the anionic compound of layered double hydroxides (LDHs). Specifically, a ZnNiFe–LDH was synthesized by co-precipitation method, during which CO2 was stored between LDH layers in the form of carbonate. Then, a certain amount of metal vacancies were introduced into LDH nanosheets by selectively etching Zn2+ ions. ICP-AES, EPR and XPS showed that the concentration of Zn vacancies gradually increased with the etching time prolonging, which thus optimized the electronic structure of LDH layers. Under the catalysis of the electron-rich metal cations and hydroxyl groups on the layers, the interlayer carbonate was in situ reduced into CO coupled accompanied with the 5-HMF oxidation to 2.5-furandiformaldehyde (DFF). Compared with the unetched ZnNiFe–LDHs, the CO and DFF yields over the LDHs etched for 3 h were increased by 2.84 and 2.82 times under UV-vis irradiation with a density of 500 mW cm−2. Finally, combined with isotope-labeled 13CO2 experiments and in situ FTIR characterization, we revealed the possible coupling mechanism and defect-induced performance enhancement mechanism.
1. Introduction
The use of fossil fuels has greatly contributed to modern industrialization and economic development, but at the same time, it also led to serious environmental problems.1–3 Notably, the concentration of carbon dioxide in the earth's atmosphere exceeds a staggering 400 ppm, compared to just 280 ppm before the industrial revolution, leading to global warming and extreme climate.4–6 In this background, solar-driven CO2 reduction with H2O into high-value-added compounds, such as CO, CH4, C2H6, CH3OH, etc., via semiconductors is generally regarded as a promising technology for achieving the reduction of CO2 emission and production of energy resources simultaneously.7–9 However, the low efficiency of this process suffers from the slow kinetics rate of the water oxidation half-reaction (2H2O + 4h+/4H+ + O2), leading to the recombination of excited electrons and unused holes.10–12 To minimize the issue, a common strategy is to employ sacrificial electron donors as hole scavengers. However, such a strategy wastes the oxidizing power of the excited holes.13–15
In recent years, the research on biomass upgrading has attracted much attention.16 5-Hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF)17,18 as an important biomass platform, its oxidation products contain 2.5-furandiformaldehyde (DFF), which could be used to synthesize ligands, pesticides, antifungal agents, fluorescent materials and novel polymers; 5-formyl-2-furanacarboxylic acid (FFCA) is often used to synthesize various drug derivatives because of its unique structural advantages; and the final oxidation product 2.5-furan dicarboxylic acid (FDCA) could replace a variety of petroleum substrate products and is considered as the most promising product in the furan family.19,20 Therefore, using 5-HMF as oxidized reactant and H donor can obtain high value-added products while enhancing the performance of CO2 reduction.
Considering CO2 photoreduction integrated with oxidation of 5-HMF is a typical gas–liquid–solid three-phase catalytic system, thus the limited solubility of CO2 would be a key factor restricting the reaction efficiency.21 Recently, Yang et al.51 solved such problems in electrochemistry by using gas diffusion electrodes, which alleviated the mass transfer constraint of dissolved CO2 and reduced the ohmic loss by shortening the distance of the reactant to the reaction sites and avoiding bubble appearance. Zhang et al.52 prepared Ag–TiO2 supported at the gas–water boundary, which can quickly transport CO2 to the surface of the photocatalyst while maintaining an effective water supply and undiscovered active sites, with performance 8 times that of nanoparticles dispersed in the liquid phase. It encourages us to increase the concentration of CO2 molecules on the catalyst surface from other perspectives.
Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) is a kind of two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterial stacking by positively charged layers and charge compensating anions between the interlayers with a general structure formula of [M1−x2+Mx3+(OH)2]x+[An−]x/n·mH2O.22 More importantly, LDHs has the strongest affinity for CO32− among many anions, indicating that LDHs could act as a solid medium for storage CO2.23 Moreover, an important structural feature of the LDHs material is that the M2+ and M3+ cations are distributed in the laminate in a uniform manner, and the diversity and tunability of the lamellar elements make it have a wide range of tunable band gap, which is helpful for photoredox-catalyzed coupling reaction systems for integrating CO2 reduction with 5-HMF oxidation.24,25 Theoretically, some layer ions on LDHs could adsorb and activate CO2, and the abundant hydroxyl group of LDHs is generally considered to be the adsorption site of the alcohol, thereby facilitating O–H cleavage, indicating that LDHs could be used as the catalyst for CO2 reduction and alcohol oxidation.26–28 In addition, according to the study of Tan et al.10 defect-rich two-dimensional lamellar materials could regulate the band gap and reduce the activation barrier of photocatalytic CO2 reactions, thereby improving the conversion activity of CO2. Wang et al.29 proved by density functional theory (DFT) calculations that the hydroxyl group adjacent to the metal vacancy is easier to activate benzyl alcohol, compared with common hydroxyl. Therefore, introducing metal vacancy defect sites into the LDHs layer by defect engineering method30 and adjusting the charge density of the layer could improve the accessibility of CO32− reduction and adjust the adsorption and activation modes of 5-HMF in the coupling reaction process, which provides the possibility to improve its performance.
In this work, the photocatalytic coupling process of CO2 reduction and 5-HMF oxidation was driven by using LDHs as the mediate. CO32−–ZnNiFe–LDHs catalyst was constructed by using anion storage properties and introducing photoresponsive Zn2+, Ni2+ and Fe2+ into LDHs layers. Subsequently, the Zn2+ cations in the layer were selectively etched by alkaline etching method, and the concentration of vacancy defects was accurately controlled by changing the etching time. The results of XRD, FTIR and TG-MS showed that the interlayer anion of LDHs was CO32−. ICP-AES, EPR and SEM confirmed that the etched ZnNiFe–LDHs formed Zn2+ metal vacancy defects and remained the well-defined 2D layered structure. The XPS results further clarify that the formation of metal vacancy defects affects the electronic structure of LDHs layers. The performance results show that etching ZnNiFe–LDHs is more conducive to the reaction, and the 3 h-etching LDHs achieved high interlayer carbonate conversion, with CO as the main reduction product, and DFF, FDCA and FFCA as the oxidation products. The layered structure remained stable after five cycles of catalysis. Finally, the catalytic effects of metal vacancy defects and surface hydroxyl groups were verified by FTIR, isotope labeling and photocurrent characterization, and the mechanism of photocatalytic coupling was revealed.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials
The source and purity of all the reagents used for synthesis were given as follows: zinc nitrate hexahydrate (Zn(NO3)2·6H2O, Aladdin, 99.99%), nickel nitrate hexahydrate (Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, Aladdin, 98%), iron nitrate nonahydrate (Fe(NO3)3·9H2O, Aladdin, 99.99%), sodium hydroxide (NaOH, Aladdin, 98%), sodium carbonate (Na2CO3, Aladdin, 99.5%), sodium carbonate–13C (Na213CO3, Aladdin), acetonitrile (CH3CN, Aladdin, 99.9%), potassium hydroxide (KOH, Aladdin, 99.99%), 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furaldehyde (5-HMF, Aladdin, 99.9%), deionized water (home-made, 10−6 S cm−1).
2.2. Preparation of ZnNiFe–LDHs
The ZnNiFe–LDHs were synthesized by coprecipitation method as reported in the literature.31 Briefly, 0.7140 g of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O, 2.7915 g of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O and 2.4240 g of Fe(NO3)3·9H2O were dissolved in 100 mL of deionized water as solution A; 0.6000 g of NaOH and 3.1797 g of Na2CO3 were dissolved in 100 mL of deionized water as solution B. The solution A and B were then added drop by drop to a 500 mL flask containing 100 mL deionized water in an air atmosphere, and the pH of whole system was maintained at 9.0 ± 0.05. The flask was sealed and aged at 50 °C for 48 h. After that, the precipitate was centrifuged and washed repeatedly, following by dried overnight to obtain ZnNiFe–LDHs.
2.3. Etching of ZnNiFe–LDHs
The 0.1000 g ZnNiFe–LDHs were first dispersed in 20 mL deionized water by sonication, then 20 ml of 2 mol L−1 KOH solution was slowly poured into the ultrasonic LDHs suspension, which was stirring for 1 h, 2 h and 3 h at 70 °C, respectively. After the reaction, the precipitate was centrifuged, washed to neutral (pH = 7) and the resulting solid was dried overnight to obtain ZnNiFe–LDHs–E1h, ZnNiFe–LDHs–E2h and ZnNiFe–LDHs–E3h.
2.4. Catalyst characterization
The sample powder was scanned by Rigaku UItima III X-ray diffractometer with a scan step of 10° min−1. The Hitachi S-4800 scanning electron microscope (SEM) was used to characterize the morphology. The metal content before and after etching was determined with Shimadu ICPS-75000 inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometer (ICP-AES). The structure of the samples was characterized by TG/DTA X70 thermogravimetric analyzer at a temperature of 10° min−1 to 1000 °C in Ar atmosphere. N2 physisorption and specific surface area (SSA) of all catalysts were characterized by micromeritics ASAP 2460. The defect structure of the catalyst before and after etching was characterized by EMX-500 10//12 electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. A Thermo VG ESCALAB 250 spectrometer with a monochromatic Al Kα anode were used to record the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and valence band data. The UV-vis spectra of the samples were recorded on USA Lambda 950, PE, spectrometer. In situ FT-IR measurements were performed using a Bruker Tensor 27 spectrometer installed with a highly sensitive MCT detector and a three-window photocatalytic chamber. For adsorbing 5-HMF, which has poor volatility, 30 mg catalyst was dispersed in a 5-HMF solution with a certain concentration (5.0 mL, 2 M) for 30 min. The obtained slurry was mixed in a shaker with continuous magnetic stirring for 4 h and collected by low-speed centrifuge and then dried through vacuum freeze-drying. Then, 5 mg of the above catalyst and 45 mg KBr were grind and mixed thoroughly for lamination before being placed in the chamber for in situ tests. Subsequently, the sample was pretreated under an argon atmosphere at 60 °C for 1 h. After an initial background scan, the light was turned on for measurement, and the spectrogram was recorded in the range 4000–1100 cm−1 with 64 accumulation scans every 1 h. After 3 h of illumination, the xenon lamp was turned off, the air was introduced into the in situ chamber, and spectra were recorded every 1 h. The photocurrent measurements of the photocatalysts were measured in a three-electrode system with an electrochemical workstation (CHI660E). The photoluminescence (PL) spectra were identified on a fluorescence spectrometer (Shimadzu; UV-3600) and the excitation wavelength was 269 nm.
2.5. Photocatalytic reaction performance
The photocatalytic performance was evaluated in stainless steel photocatalytic reactor (150 mL) with 1 cm thick sapphire window plate irradiated by a 300 W Xe lamp. Specifically, the catalyst (30.00 mg) was added into 0.02 g L−1 5-HMF acetonitrile solution (60 mL). Then Ar was used with a rate of 40 mL min−1 for 30 minutes at 30 °C to remove the air in the system and the final Ar pressure was 0.20 MPa. During the reaction process, the temperature inside the reaction kettle is always kept between 35 °C and 38 °C by adjusting the temperature of condensate water outside the circulating reaction kettle. After reaction for several hours, the Shimadzu gas chromatograph (GC-2014C) (packed columns: Molsieve, HayeSep Q and H–N) was used to analyze the gas product. The liquid was detected by HPLC (HPX-87H) with the mobile phase was 5 mmol L−1 H2SO4. After the reaction, the sample was centrifuged, re-dispersed in the solution and exposed to air for 12 h to store CO2 in the form of CO32−. Then, it were put into the reactor, and the above steps were repeated to evaluate the catalytic performance.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Characterization of ZnNiFe–LDHs before and after etching
The ZnNiFe–LDHs with the molar ratio of Zn:Ni:Fe = 1:4:2.5 was synthesized by coprecipitation method. To obtain the structural information, XRD and IR were employed. As shown in Fig. 1B, the pristine ZnNiFe–LDHs shows typical LDHs characteristic diffraction peaks of (003), (006), (009), (015), (018), (110) and (113), proving the successful synthesis of LDHs with well-crystallized layered structure.32 Based on the Bragg equation and crystallographic index formula, the interplanar spacing was calculated to be 0.76 nm from the (003) reflection, indicating the interlayer anion was CO32−, which was further verified by the IR band (Fig. 1D) at 1350 cm−1.33,34 Then, ZnNiFe–LDHs was etched by alkaline solution (2 mol L−1 KOH) for 1 h, 2 h and 3 h, the samples were named as ZnNiFe–LDHs–E1h, ZnNiFe–LDHs–E2h, ZnNiFe–LDHs–E3h. A schematic of the morphological evolution of the ZnNiFe–LDHs as a function of alkali etching time was showed in Fig. 1A. Subsequently, we can assign a Miller index to each peak and calculate the lattice parameters required to describe the cell.53 As shown in Table S1,† the unit cell (c = 2.29) of the original LDHs was calculated based on the location of the diffraction peak of (003). The shortest distance (a = 0.31) between two metal cations in a hydroxide layer is also calculated based on twice the lattice spacing of (110) diffraction. In addition, the mean thickness of the original LDHs along the C-axis was found to be 9.8 nm, indicating that the particles consist of approximately 11–15 brucite-like hydroxide layers. While after etching, it is worth noting that the shortest distance between the unit cell and the cation of the etched catalyst does not change, but the average thickness of LDHs particles increases from 9.8 nm to about 14.4 nm, which may be due to the stacking of nanosheets caused by the structural damage of hydrotalcite etched catalyst.

In order to investigate the effect of etching process on the content of metal ions in LDHs layers, the ICP-AES characterization was conducted. The results listed in Table S2† exhibited that the molar concentrations of Ni2+ and Fe3+ did not change significantly, while the molar concentrations of Zn2+ decreased by 80%, 83% and 90%, respectively. The selective etching of Zn2+ ions may contribute to formation of a large number of metal vacancy defects in the LDHs laminate. The XRD patterns of etched LDHs in Fig. 1B indicted the crystallinity of the sample lose a little due to the decreased intensity of diffraction peaks, but the characteristic layered structure of LDHs was still retained. Furthermore, the (110) diffraction peak (Fig. 1C) shifted to higher 2θ angles with increasing etching time, indicating a lateral shrinkage of the individual LDH nanosheets, which may be caused by the absence of zinc and oxygen ions from the layers during etching. The morphologies of the four samples were characterized by SEM (Fig. S1†). The four samples all exhibited typical LDHs sheet morphology, and the average size decreased with the etching time (167.7, 138.1, 129.7 and 123.5 nm), which is consistent with the XRD results. The infrared vibration intensity at 1350 cm−1 remained basically unchanged after etching, indicating that the interlayer carbonate did not decrease, which may be due to the correlation between the content of interlayer carbonate and the Fe3+.35
To further verify the above conjecture, TG-MS characterization was carried out. As shown in Fig. 1E–G, three stages of weight loss can be observed.36 In stage I, the weight loss from room temperature to 200 °C is mainly attributed to adsorbed and interlayer water. In stage II, the sharp and rapid weight decrease in the range of 200–420 °C is mainly due to interlayer carbonate and hydroxyl decomposition. The last part of weight loss is caused by the decomposition of the remaining carbonate anion, leading to the release of CO2. The content of hydroxyl in the interlayer (Table S3†) decreased gradually with the etching time, from 15.56% before etching to 11.98% after three hours of etching, while the content of CO32− in the interlayer remained basically unchanged (17.03%, 17.05%, 17.45% and 17.00%), indicating that the hydroxyl groups was lost along with the Zn(II) sites in order to ensure the charge balance of the laminar during etching. In addition, pore diameter and the surface area changes of LDHs before and after etching were investigated by N2 adsorption and desorption (Fig. S2†) at 77 K. The specific surface area calculated through the BET method for ZnNiFe–LDHs, ZnNiFe–LDHs–E1h, ZnNiFe–LDHs–E2h, and ZnNiFe–LDHs–E3h was 118.0 m2 g−1, 108.6 m2 g−1, 104.1 m2 g−1, and 105.6 m2 g−1, suggesting that the specific surface areas of the etched catalysts decreased slightly. One possible reason for this result is that the charge balance of LDHs layer is disrupted due to the formation of zinc vacancy after etching, the structure of LDHs is destroyed to a certain extent, which leads to the accumulation and agglomeration of LDHs nanosheets. This speculation can be supported by the XRD results that the average thickness of LDHs particles increases from 9.8 nm for the original LDHs to about 14 nm for the etched samples. Therefore, the stacking of nanosheets caused by the structural damage of hydrotalcite etched catalyst leads to partial loss of specific surface area. Furthermore, it can be seen that these four samples have type iv isotherms classified by BDDT, which are commonly seen in the mesoporous superimposed structure of two-dimensional sheet nanomaterials. The isotherms for original LDHs and all etched samples show H3-type hysteresis loop, proving the existence of mesoporous in the four samples.37 In addition, a multi-peak distribution was observed in the pore size distribution of ZnNiFe–LDHs–E2h and ZnNiFe–LDHs–E3h, suggesting that the etching process may induce the formation of some larger mesoporous pores, which may promote the diffusion of 5-HMF in the nanoreactors.
To further verify the increase of metal defects in the LDHs after etching, EPR characterization was used (Fig. 2A). As expected, an EPR signal related with Zn2+ vacancy (VZn) was detected at g = 2.05 in both pristine and etched LDHs.25 Specifically, it can be seen that the signal intensity of ZnNiFe–LDHs–Exh increased significantly, indicating that alkaline etching method induced abundant metal defects in ZnNiFe–LDHs, and the concentration of VZn increased gradually in the following order: ZnNiFe–LDHs < ZnNiFe–LDHs–E1h < ZnNiFe–LDHs–E2h < ZnNiFe–LDHs–E3h.

As reported, the metal defects could induce the adjacent anion to show the electron-deficient state.38 Therefore, XPS was used to characterize the electronic structure of hydroxyl O in the LDHs. As shown in Fig. 2B, the spectra of O 1s region were deconvolved into three peaks corresponding to the different oxygen species.39,40 The two small peaks at 530.5 and 532.7 eV correspond to the surface physical adsorption or residual water molecules and interlayer carbonate, respectively. The main peak centered at 531.3 eV was attributed to the hydroxyl O species of LDHs. It can be observed the binding energies of hydroxyl O in the three etched samples gradually shifted to the higher energy level with the etching time prolonged, indicating that increasing the number of metal defects will increase degree of electron deficiency of hydroxyl oxygen.
Theoretically, the introduction of metal defects on the layers will generate more unsaturated metal sites, which could be induced into an electron-enriched state in order to maintain the charge balance of the layers.41 In addition, the change in the electronic structure of hydroxyl could also affect the electronic states of its neighboring metal ions.42 Therefore, we compared the XPS spectra of Ni 2p and Fe 2p before and after etching to confirm the variations of the electronic structures.38,43 As displayed in Fig. 2C, the Ni 2p spectrum of ZnNiFe–LDHs shows two spin–orbit peaks centered at 856.3 eV (Ni 2p3/2) and 873.9 eV (Ni 2p1/2) with two satellite peaks. It is noteworthy that, compared with the original ZnNiFe LDHs, the positions of four characteristic peaks of Ni shifted to the lower binding energy with the extension of etching time, indicating the generation of electron-rich Ni2+. In addition, it is also observed that the Fe 2p3/2 and Fe 2p1/2 characteristic peaks for etched samples also shift to lower binding energy, indicating the formation of new electron-rich ion Fe3+ species. These results further proved that the etched LDHs formed metal vacancy defects that led to changes in the electronic structure of the LDHs layer.
3.2. Light response and band structure of catalysts
UV-vis was used to explore the photo-response property of the catalysts before and after etching, and the results were displayed in Fig. 3A. After etching treatment, ZnNiFe–LDHs–Exh catalysts exhibited better light absorption intensity than ZnNiFe–LDHs in the range of 200–800 nm, and the ZnNiFe–LDHs–E3h reached the best. This result proved that the light absorption capacity of the catalyst could be enhanced by etching treatment.44 To further explore whether the catalysts meet the thermodynamic requirements of coupling reaction before and after etching, the UV-vis spectra were put into the formula ahμ = C(hμ − Eg)2 for processing.45 With hμ as the abscissa and (ahμ)2 as the ordinate, the obtained curves were tangentially processed, and Fig. 3B was obtained. It can be seen that the band gaps of ZnNiFe–LDHs, ZnNiFe–LDHs–E1h, ZnNiFe–LDHs–E2h and ZnNiFe–LDHs–E3h were 2.29 eV, 2.09 eV, 1.97 eV and 1.81 eV, respectively, indicating the narrower band gap of etched catalysts, which was due to the change of electronic structure of LDHs layers caused by the formation of defects after etching and the electron-rich Ni2+ is more favorable for the generation of photodriven carriers.46 The narrow band gap is conducive to the improvement of photocatalytic coupling reaction efficiency. The XPS was used to analyze the valence band spectra of the photocatalysts (Fig. 3C), and combined with the band gap data, the possible band structures of the four catalysts were drawn (Fig. 3D). The valence band position of the etched catalyst moved upward from 1.51 eV to 1.14 eV. Notably, the conduction band and valence band positions of all the catalysts were higher than the potential required for CO2 reduction (−0.54 eV) and lower than the potential required for HMF oxidation (0.06 eV), respectively, indicating that the series of catalysts were thermochemically capable of both CO2 reduction and 5-HMF oxidation.47,48

3.3. Photocatalytic reduction of CO2 with oxidation of 5-HMF
The photocatalytic coupling reaction performance of catalysts with different etching degrees was investigated, with the pristine ZnNiFe–LDHs as control sample. The photocatalytic reduction of interlayer carbonate of LDHs was evaluated in the absence of CO2. The performance of the reduction half-reaction was shown in Fig. 4A, the reduction products of the four photocatalysts were all CO with selectivity close to 100%. It is worth noting that the catalytic performance after etching has been improved. After reaction for 4 h, the cumulative CO yield of ZnNiFe–LDHs–E3h was 76.32 μmol g−1, which is 2.8 times of that of ZnNiFe–LDHs. It proves that the introduction of metal defects indeed contributes to the interlayer CO32− activation. In addition, the time performance charts of CO (Fig. S3†) show that the average production rate over all the four catalysts is higher in the first 1 h, and tends to be stable in the last three hours, declaring that part of the interlayer carbonate is easier to be activated during the initial reaction. Fig. 4B shows the half-reaction performance of 5-HMF oxidation, and the oxidation products are DFF, FFCA and FDCA. The results show that the oxidation half reaction displayed a similar trend to the reduction half-reaction. In particular, ZnNiFe–LDHs–E3h has the highest oxidation performance, and the cumulative yields of DFF, FFCA and FDCA within 4 h are 55.12, 12.37 and 6.71 μmol g−1, respectively, which is significantly better than the performance (19.53, 3.98, 1.96 μmol g−1) of the unetched catalysts. The 5-HMF conversion, product selectivity and photogenerated hole/electron value were listed in Table S4.† The conversion of 5-HMF of ZnNiFe LDHs–E3h is three times that of pristine ZnNiFe–LDHs (from 8.25% to 24.83%), and the selectivity of DFF slightly decreased from 75.4% to 70.7%. Notably, the additional oxygen atoms required for the generation of FFCA and FDCA may be provided by the surface and interlayer water oxidation of LDHs in this oxygen-free reaction system. In addition, the photogenerated hole/electron ratios of ZnNiFe–LDHs, ZnNiFe–LDHs–E1h, ZnNiFe–LDHs–E2h and ZnNiFe–LDHs–E3h catalysts are 1.24, 1.32, 1.27 and 1.31, respectively, which are slightly higher than the theoretical value 1. This phenomenon indicates that the oxidation half-reaction performance is better than the reduction half-reaction over the series of photocatalysts. The mismatch of oxidation and reduction half-reaction may be caused by the quenching of some electrons by O2. Since the reaction is carried out in an anaerobic system, it should be noted that the conversion of 5-HMF to FDCA requires additional oxygen atoms, so it is speculated that the oxygen in FDCA may be from O2 released by the oxidation of LDHs interlayer water. It is worth noting that photocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction and photocatalytic 5-HMF oxidation reactions have been reported, but carbon dioxide photocatalytic coupling reactions are rarely reported in the literature. Compared with conventional carbon dioxide photoreduction reaction, the average CO yield of photocatalytic coupling reaction is not much different. In addition, the use of 5-HMF as a hole sacrificial agent can avoid hole waste and generate value-added fine chemicals. More important, compared with our previous work using etched CuCoAl–LDHs and ultra-thin Pt/MgFe–LDHs nanosheets as nanocatalysts for photocatalytic coupling reactions, the selectivity of both oxidation and reduction half-reaction products here is improved (Table S5†).

To further compare the effects of 5-HMF and H2O oxidation on the CO32−in situ conversion efficiency between LDHs layers, ZnNiFe–LDHs–E3h was evaluated under the condition of acetonitrile + H2O. As shown in Fig. 4C, the CO yield of acetonitrile + H2O was 10.69 μmol g−1, which was much lower than that of 5-HMF, indicating that the use of 5-HMF as the hole sacrificial agent to participate in the oxidation half-reaction can effectively improve the conversion efficiency of CO32−. In addition, in order to confirm that the interlayer CO32− of LDHs was the carbon source for the reduction half-reaction, a comparative experiment was conducted without adding catalyst into the solution of the coupled reaction system, and it was found that the cumulative yield of CO at 4 h was only 0.64 μmol g−1, and the carbon source for the reaction was preliminatively estimated to be interlayer CO32−. To further trace the carbon source, 13CO32−–ZnNiFe–LDHs synthesized from Na213CO3 were selectively etched and evaluated in 5-HMF-acetonitrile solution. The FTIR (Fig. S4†) indicated that 13C was successfully intercalated into LDHs layers. The generated gas was tested by MS (Fig. 4D), a significant 13CO signal at m/z = 29, which confirmed that CO was generated by the 13CO32− from LDHs layers. In addition, the signal of O2 appeared at m/z = 32 at the same time, which further proved that the oxygen atoms in FFCA and FDCA originated from O2 released by interlayer water oxidation.
The structural stability of the used ZnNiFe–LDHs–E3h catalyst was further investigated. As displayed in Fig. S5,† the used catalyst maintained a well-defined layered structure, indicating that it could restore CO32−. Therefore, the collected ZnNiFe–LDHs–E3h was then re-dispersed in reaction solution and exposed to air for 12 h to replenish the consumed CO32−. After five consecutive cycles (Fig. 5), the yield of CO and DFF remained stable, and the conversion of CO32− and the oxidation efficiency of 5-HMF were maintained at 89.81% and 92.60%, respectively, indicating the good reusability of ZnNiFe–LDHs–E3h.

3.4. Mechanism investigation of in situ CO32− transformation and photocoupling reaction
The above results preliminarily confirmed the ability of LDHs to store CO2 and convert it into high-value products in situ. To further confirm this process, in situ FTIR was used to explore the conversion and replenishment process of 13CO32−–ZnNiFe–LDHs–E3h. Fig. 6A shows that the vibration peak of 13CO32− located at 1324 cm−1 gradually weakened along with irradiation, and 13C labeled monotentate carbonate species appeared at 1495 cm−1, indicating that 13CO32− was activated under light.49 Subsequently, the light source was turned off and air was introduced into the in situ chamber. With the recovery time prolonging, the position of 13CO32− vibration peak gradually moved to the higher wavenumber and stabilized at 1341 cm−1, indicating the LDHs successfully absorbed 12CO2 in the air and converted it into 12CO32− between layers. The difference spectrum processing results of light-4 h and air-4 h spectra further confirmed this conclusion. In addition, a small amount of 13CO2 was passed into the in situ chamber under simulated air atmosphere (21% O2 and 78% N2). As shown in Fig. 6B, the 13CO32− signal intensity at 1324 cm−1 gradually increases with time, indicating that 13CO2 could be absorbed and converted into interlayer 13CO32−. Further, the in situ chamber was purified with Ar, and the 13CO32− signal intensity gradually decreased under light, which clearly indicated that 13CO32− could be used as a reaction substrate at the reduction half-reaction.

In order to further elucidate the mechanism of the coupling reaction between photocatalytic CO2 reduction and 5-HMF oxidation, in situ FTIR characterization of ZnNiFe–LDHs–E3h preabsorbed 5-HMF was performed under light. As shown in Fig. 6C, the signals at 1668, 1520, 1190 and 1021 cm−1 could be attributed to the stretching vibration peaks of CO, CC, C–O–C and C–OH in the 5-HMF respectively.48 Among them, the C–OH vibration peak of 5-HMF preadsorbed on ZnNiFe–LDHs–E3h shifted to a lower wave number, indicating that the hydroxyl functional group of 5-HMF was dissociated on the nanocrystalline reactor, which was helpful for the activation of hydroxyl group in the reaction process. Along with the irradiation, the signal intensity of C–OH and CO32− between the layers of the nanocrystalline reactor gradually decreased, and the infrared vibration peak of CO in the DFF molecule belonging to the oxidation product of 5-HMF at 1606 cm−1 gradually increased. The results showed that CO32− was effectively transformed between 5-HMF and LDHs. These results confirm that the oxidation of 5-HMF could be coupled with the interlayer CO32− reduction in the LDHs under light conditions. Combined with the above results, we demonstrate that LDHs can be used as a solid medium to store CO2, and it could be coupled with the oxidation of 5-HMF in a CO2-free atmosphere for photocatalytic reduction to other chemicals.
3.5. Structure-performance correlation of carbonate LDHs
In the photocatalytic reaction, electrons and holes promote the reduction half-reaction and oxidation half-reaction respectively, so the efficiency of photogenerated electron–hole separation in the catalysts could directly affect the catalytic efficiency of the coupled reaction. In general, metal vacancy defects are easier to capture photogenerated electrons or holes generated by photoexcitation, so as to inhibit the recombination of electrons and holes and improve the efficiency of photogenerated carrier separation.50 PL spectra were used to investigate the differences of photoinduced charge carrier separation and recombination between the four samples. Currently, the weaker the PL spectral signal intensity of the catalyst represents the stronger the photogenerated electron–hole separation ability. As shown in Fig. 7A, among all the samples, ZnNiFe–LDHs exhibited strong PL signal, and the corresponding intensity decreased in the order of ZnNiFe–LDHs > ZnNiFe–LDHs–E1h > ZnNiFe–LDHs–E2h > ZnNiFe LDHs–E3h. As expected, ZnNiFe–LDHs–E3h with the most abundant metal defects has the strongest photogenerated electron–hole separation ability, indicating the more electrons and holes could participate in the coupling reaction. Moreover, to further confirm the separation efficiency of photogenerated electron–hole in solution conditions before and after etching, photocurrent measurements were performed on all the samples with the UV-visible light source repeatedly turned on and off. Firstly, the initial electron generation capacity of the catalyst was tested in aqueous Na2SO4 solution. As displayed in Fig. 7B, the photocurrent intensity of LDHs nanoreactor was enhanced after etching, and the ZnNiFe–LDHs–E3h was the strongest, indicating the generation of the most photogenerated electrons under the same light, which was conducive to the reaction. Subsequently, in order to prove that 5-HMF as the substrate of oxidation terminal reaction could promote the photocatalytic reaction, the Na2SO4 solution of 5-HMF with the same concentration as the reaction was prepared for the photocurrent response test. Fig. 7C showed that the photocurrent intensities of ZnNiFe–LDHs and ZnNiFe–LDHs–E3h were enhanced after the addition of 5-HMF, indicating the promotion of 5-HMF for the reaction as the substrate of oxidation terminal reaction. Notably, the photocurrent of ZnNiFe–LDHs–E3h was 1.9 times higher than that without 5-HMF, while the photocurrent of ZnNiFe–LDHs was only 1.1 times. This may be due to the structure of the etched LDHs contributing to the activation of 5-HMF. In addition, the interfacial impedance (Fig. 7D) of ZnNiFe–LDHs–E3h was lower than that of ZnNiFe–LDHs, indicating a stronger ability to transfer charge between the adsorbent and the adsorbent of ZnNiFe–LDHs–E3h.
 Fig. 7  (A) PL spectrum, (B) photocurrent response spectrum, (C) photocurrent response spectrum before and after adding 5-HMF, (D) interface impedance spectrum of ZnNiFe–LDHs catalysts before and after etching. 
In addition to the rate of electron–hole separation, the ability of the catalyst to activate the substrate molecules on the surface reaction is also critical. Therefore, the activation efficiency of ZnNiFe–LDH and ZnNiFe–LDHs–E3h on CO32− was characterized by FTIR. As shown in Fig. S6,† the ZnNiFe–LDHs were illuminated for 4 h, the peaking area of CO32− decreased by 10.3% compared with that before the reaction and the cumulative CO yield was 13.61 μmol g−1. However, the peak area reduction and cumulative CO yield of ZnNiFe–LDHs–E3h were 19.6% and 29.87 μmol g−1, respectively, which were 1.9 and 2.2 times higher than those of ZnNiFe–LDHs. The difference in reduction efficiency may be related to the fact that the electron-rich Ni2+ in the etched catalyst is more conducive to the activation of reactant molecules. Moreover, FTIR was used to further explore the effect of metal vacancies on 5-HMF activation. As shown in Fig. S7,† the C–OH adsorption positions of ZnNiFe–LDHs and ZnNiFe–LDHs–E3h were significantly different. Specifically, compared with the liquid 5-HMF, the chemisorbed 5-HMF on ZnNiFe–LDHs exhibited a slight red-shift of C–OH stretching vibration band (from 1027 to 1026 cm−1). However, the C–OH adsorption band on ZnNiFe–LDHs–E3h is redshifted by 6 cm−1 (from 1027 to 1021 cm−1), indicating ZnNiFe–LDHs–E3h displayed stronger interaction with 5-HMF. Based on the above results, the improvement of photocurrent density and catalytic performance is due to the fact that the electron-rich Ni2+ in ZnNiFe–LDHs–E3h may promote the interlayer CO32− activation, and the hydroxyl sites near the metal vacancy may interact with 5-HMF formation to promote the activation of 5-HMF.
Based on the above structure–activity relationship studies, a possible mechanism was proposed to explain the decent catalytic performance of defect-rich ZnNiFe–LDHs in the coupling reaction between photocatalytic CO2in situ conversion and 5-HMF oxidation (Scheme 1). Based on the strong affinity of LDHs to CO32−, LDHs could store CO2 in the form of CO32− between layers. Furthermore, the electron-deficient hydroxyl sites adjacent to the metal vacancies on LDHs layers contribute to adsorption and activation of the hydroxyl functional group in 5-HMF. The electron-rich Ni2+ near the metal vacancy could promote the activation of interlayer CO32−. Therefore, 5-HMF and interlayer CO32− could take place coupling oxidation–reduction reaction under illumination condition. After the reaction, LDHs could continue to absorb CO2 in the air to supplement the interlayer CO32− consumed in the reaction process, and then used in the photocatalytic coupling reaction.

4. Conclusion
Herein, we propose an interlayer anion-mediated CO2 reduction reaction in LDHs coupled with the 5-HMF oxidation. Specifically, a CO32−–ZnNiFe–LDHs photocatalytic catalyst for the coupling reaction was constructed by co-precipitation method. Then, according to the polymetallic characteristics, the Zn2+ in the LDHs layers was etched by selective etching method, and the catalysts with different enrichment degrees of metal vacancy defects were further constructed. XRD, SEM, FTIR and TG-MS results demonstrated that ZnNiFe–LDHs could pre-enrich CO2 in the form of CO32−, and the etched LDHs still maintained a good crystal structure and sheet morphology. The results of ICP-AES, XPS and EPR confirmed that Zn2+ were selectively etched to form metal vacancy defects. In addition, the introduction of metal vacancy defects made the Ni2+ and Fe3+ in the electron-enriched state, while the hydroxyl group was in the electron-deficient state. As elucidated by UV-vis and energy band spectrum, the series of catalysts had good photo-response ability and met the thermodynamic conditions of coupling of CO2 reduction and 5-HMF oxidation. ZnNiFe–LDHs etched for 3 h achieved high-performance in situ CO32− reduction and 5-HMF oxidation coupling reaction under 500 mw cm−2 UV-vis light intensity. The cumulative yields of CO and DFF were 76.32 and 55.12 μmol g−1, respectively, which were 2.84 and 2.82 times before etching. Finally, photocurrent and FTIR activation studies confirmed that the synergic effect of the electron-rich Ni2+ site and the electron-deficient hydroxyl site on LDHs layers promoted the activation of CO32− and 5-HMF, thus improving the performance of the photocatalytic coupling reaction. This work demonstrates the potential of LDHs materials to combine CO2 capture and utilization with efficient conversion of biomass resources. LDHs as an atypical carbonate material, it opens a promising way for the design and construction of efficient catalyst for CO2 coupling conversion of conventional metal carbonates.
