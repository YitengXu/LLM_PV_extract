    , Accepted 17th June 2015First published on 10th July 2015AbstractTo achieve highly efficient mesoscopic perovskite solar cells (PSCs), the structure and properties of an electron transport layer (ETL) or material (ETM) have been shown to be of supreme importance. Particularly, the core–shell heterostructured mesoscopic ETM architecture has been recognized as a successful electrode design, because of its large internal surface area, superior light-harvesting efficiency and its ability to achieve fast charge transport. Here we report the successful fabrication of a hysteresis-free, 15.3% efficient PSC using vertically aligned ZnO nanorod/TiO2 shell (ZNR/TS) core–shell heterostructured ETMs for the first time. We have also added a conjugated polyelectrolyte polymer into the growth solution to promote the growth of high aspect ratio (AR) ZNRs and substantially improve the infiltration of the perovskite light absorber into the ETM. The PSCs based on the as-synthesized core–shell ZnO/TiO2 heterostructured ETMs exhibited excellent performance enhancement credited to the superior light harvesting capability, larger surface area, prolonged charge-transport pathways and lower recombination rate. The unique ETM design together with minimal hysteresis introduces core–shell ZnO/TiO2 heterostructures as a promising mesoscopic electrode approach for the fabrication of efficient PSCs.
1. Introduction
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have recently emerged as the front runner among emerging thin film photovoltaic technologies, owing to their potentially inexpensive manufacturing using earth-abundant materials and reaching a certified efficiency as high as 20.1% in a remarkably short period.1,2 The current record holder is part of a class of mesoscopic PSCs, which use transparent mesoscopic semiconducting metal oxides (i.e., ZnO, TiO2, SrTiO3 and WO3)3,4–10 as the electron transporting material (ETM) in order to efficiently make contact with the perovskite light absorber and selectively extract the electrons while blocking the holes. The performance of PSCs has been greatly affected by the crystallinity, thickness and morphology of the mesoscopic ETMs.4,8,10 It also significantly affects the anomalous hysteresis response of PSCs and charge diffusion length in the ETM.11
In the past few years, the performances of mesoscopic PSCs have been enhanced either by modifying the ETM's morphology (e.g., using one-dimensional (1D) or three-dimensional (3D) nanostructures),12–15 by changing their electronic band structures,16–18 or by altering the physical/chemical characteristics of the perovskite–ETM interface.19 These strategies have been effective at improving charge transport and lowering recombination rates and have even been shown to enhance the device stability.15
Several groups have looked at making 1D TiO2 or ZnO nanostructure arrays because of the perceived benefits of providing a direct pathway for electron extraction as well as improved perovskite infiltration within the ETM.4,8,10,12–14,20 Some efforts have also been made at fabricating core–shell nanoarchitectures designed to enhance the light-harvesting ability and internal surface area in the context of dye- and quantum dot-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs/QDSSCs),21,22 with very few reports making use of mesoporous 3D TiO2 nanowire ETMs in the context of PSCs.11,23 Recently, we have reported highly efficient DSSCs and PSCs based on a hyperbranched 3D TiO2 ETM consisting of an electron transporting network achieving minimal recombination losses and rapid electron transport and extraction.15
We take the view that proper combination of ZnO and TiO2 to produce core–shell heterostructured ETMs can provide synergistic advantages, including the ability to grow new nanoarchitectures with enhanced light harvesting and surface area which homostructured ETMs cannot, as well as the opportunity to interface one metal oxide with the perovskite (e.g., TiO2) while utilizing the other metal oxide (e.g., ZnO) for effective electron transport to the cathode. The injected electrons may recombine with holes at the interface between the ETM and the perovskite layer, which could reduce the device performance.8,19 A similar recombination phenomenon known as back electron transfer is very common in DSSCs.19 The recombination can be effectively controlled by changing the electrical characteristics of metal oxides by coating a thin layer of nanoparticles on their surfaces.8,19
In this paper, we report on the fabrication of novel vertically aligned ZnO/TiO2 core–shell hybrid arrays consisting of vertically aligned ZnO nanorods (ZNRs) directly grown on a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate, and subsequently decorated with TiO2 shell (TS) via a two-step hydrothermal process, and demonstrate their use as a core–shell heterostructured mesoporous ETM for highly efficient PSCs. We also use polyethylenimine (PEI) as a capping agent leading to the growth of high aspect ratio (AR) ZNR arrays, and substantially improved infiltration of the perovskite light absorber, as previously reported.24,25 The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of ZNR/TS core–shell heterostructured ETM-based PSCs (15.3%) was found to be far superior to ZNR ETM-based PSCs (11.56%). The performance enhancement is attributed to improved light-harvesting efficiency and larger interfacial area for ZnO/TiO2 hybrid arrays.
2. Results and discussion
In Fig. 1 we show a schematic illustration of the step-by-step synthesis scheme for growing the vertically aligned ZnO nanorod (ZNR) arrays and subsequently using them as a backbone to be decorated with TiO2 shell (TS) and form the ZNR/TS core–shell heterostructured mesoscale ETM. The ZnO seed layer was deposited using electrospray due to the benefits it offers, such as being inexpensive, scalable, easy to handle and operable under atmospheric conditions,26–29 as compared with spray pyrolysis which requires severe temperature conditions for film fabrication.30 All of the ZnO/TiO2 hybrid arrays were grown using a simple and low temperature solution-processed two-step hydrothermal process as explained above and also in the experimental section. High aspect ratio (AR) ZNRs were obtained by adding a polymer (PEI) in the growth solution, to reduce the rod diameter and increase their aspect ratio, which facilitates perovskite infiltration into the wide open spaces between ZNRs as compared with more closely packed low AR ZNRs.24,25

The surface SEM images of the corresponding core–shell heterostructures are shown in Fig. 2. It can be seen that all ZNR or ZNR/TS arrays grow vertically on FTO glass with an approximate length of 1 μm. The low and high AR ZNRs (Fig. 2a and d) are single crystalline,24 have very smooth surfaces and such nanostructures are expected to provide a direct pathway for rapid transport of electrons toward the FTO cathode. However, we believe that the smooth surface provides a small internal surface area when contacting the perovskite, which can decrease the cell performance.22 The addition of PEI in the growth solution leads to growth of high AR ZNRs (Fig. 2d) with much smaller diameter (∼34 nm), compared with the low AR ZNRs (Fig. 2a) having a larger diameter of about 80 nm. The high AR ZNRs allow much better and complete infiltration of perovskite into the rods than their low AR counterparts, as indicated by comparing the cross-sectional SEM views of completed devices (shown in Fig. 2c and f). The spin-coated spiro-OMeTAD forms an 80 nm thin capping layer because some of the spiro-MeOTAD infiltrates down to the ZNRs. The vacuum-deposition of Au results in a 90 nm thin layer. Titania shell is grown on the entire surface of the smooth ZNR backbone, making the surface of ZNRs substantially rougher as can be seen in Fig. 2b and e. This provides a larger interfacial contact area as well as a direct contact between the perovskite and titania, which should enhance light harvesting. Also the difference in the conduction band edge of these two materials provides an energy cascade favouring extraction and reducing recombination. Therefore, the injected electrons would transfer from the TiO2 shell to the ZnO core rather than diffuse towards the surface of the photoanode or recombine with holes.31

The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the perovskite coated four different ETMs are shown in Fig. S1.† All thin films demonstrate a strong diffraction peak at 14.07°, which corresponds to the tetragonal structured perovskite.32 The similarity of the XRD patterns shows that the growth of the perovskite film is not structurally affected by the ETM type. We observed a weak XRD signal for TiO2 for core–shell heterostructured ETMs as the TiO2 layer is too thin to obtain a strong XRD signal.
The microstructure and morphology of the core–shell ZNR/TS heterostructures are further investigated by TEM (Fig. 3). In Fig. 3a, we find that the low AR ZNR backbone is entirely covered with TS, confirming that TS have been successfully grown on the ZNR backbone. In addition, the neighboring titania nanoparticles also connect with each other and form an interconnected, porous network. Such a geometry should be beneficial for achieving a good electrical contact with the perovskite. Fig. 3b shows a TEM image of high AR ZNR/TS heterostructures showing that the surface of the thinner rods is also fully decorated with TS. The chemical composition of the high AR ZNR/TS heterostructures was further confirmed using EDX analysis (Fig. S2†), obtained from the area indicated by the circular sign (in Fig. 3b); the spectrum displays intense Ti, O and Zn peaks, indicating that these elements coexist in large amounts in the ETM. The weak carbon and copper peaks originate from the copper grid used for TEM analyses.

We now turn to investigate the comparative photovoltaic performances of PSCs fabricated using various mesoscale ETM arrays, including low AR ZNRs, high AR ZNRs, low AR ZNRs/TS and high AR ZNRs/TS. In Fig. 4a and b, we show the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics and external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the PSCs, respectively, based on the four ETMs described above. Detailed photovoltaic parameters such as short-circuit current density (JSC), open circuit voltage (VOC), fill factor (FF), and PCE values of the corresponding devices are summarized in Table 1. The core–shell heterostructured array ETMs demonstrated much better photovoltaic performance than the 1D ZNR arrays. Furthermore, the high AR ZNR/TS core–shell heterostructured ETMs showed the best photovoltaic performance in terms of the highest JSC of 19.85 mA cm−2, VOC of 960 mV, FF of 66%, average PCE (PCEavg) of 12.58%, and champion PCE (PCEmax) of 15.33%. By contrast, low AR ZNR/TS core–shell heterostructured ETMs resulted in a PCEavg of 11.25% and a PCEmax of 13.59%. This trend is due to differences in the infiltration of perovskite as indicated by comparing the low to high AR ZNR ETM-based devices. Indeed, high AR ZNRs exhibited a better PCEavg of 10.71% as compared to the low AR ZNRs (PCEavg of 9.17%). Moreover, the performance enhancement for core–shell hetereostructured ETMs as opposed to the standard ZNR ETM can be attributed to the increased interfacial area available by growing the TS, as well as to the TiO2/perovskite interface.22 Actually, the TiO2 shell significantly enhance the total surface area and provide a superior surface for a better contact interface between the core–shell heterostructured ETMs and perovskite layer compared to only 1D ZNR-based ETMs, while the ZNRs facilitate the transport of electrons from TiO2 to the conducting substrate.33 The positions of the conduction and valence bands of the core and shell materials facilitate the driving force for the injection of electrons and thus electron–hole separation results in a decrease of pairs’ recombination rate.34 Moreover, the TiO2 shell hindered the recombination by passivating surface recombination sites and by creating an energy cascade barrier that stops photoinjected electrons from approaching the ZNR surface which is confirmed by the difference in the surface work function (WF) of the ZNRs (WF = 5.6 eV) and the TiO2 shell (WF = 4.8 eV).31,35 As a result, the coated TiO2 layer would retard the charge recombination at interfaces and the back electron transfer from ZnO to the hole-transporting layer and perovskite and significantly increases both the VOC and FF.8

To ensure the accuracy of our measurements, both forward and reverse J–V scans are shown in Fig. 4c (parameters summarized in Table 2) for the devices based on high and low AR ZNR/TS core–shell heterostructured ETMs. These devices demonstrate very low hysteresis and are the highest reported PCE values to date for any mesoscopic perovskite solar cell using core–shell heterostructured ETMs.4,13,14,18 Histograms shown in Fig. 4d highlight the distribution of the performance of 30 individual devices based on low and high AR ZNR/TS ETMs, yielding a PCEavg of 11.25% and 12.57%, respectively. The significant improvements in device performance between ZNR and core–shell heterostructured ETMs are further evaluated with the help of EQE spectra in Fig. 4b. The EQE values of PSCs based on heterostructured ETMs are superior to those of ZNR ETMs in the entire wavelength region. The highest EQE value at around 530 nm is 76.5% for high AR ZNR/TS ETMs, in accordance with the JSC measured from J–V curves as shown in Table 1.

In depth investigations on charge collection behavior of PSCs were further performed using transient photocurrent and photovoltage decay analyses, by which recombination and charge transport characteristics can be evaluated. In Fig. 5a we show the plot of electron diffusion coefficients as a function of JSC for four different types of ETMs. We obtain the largest values of diffusion coefficients in the case of high AR ZNR/TS heterostructured ETMs and the lowest values for the low AR ZNR film. In Fig. 5b, we show the time constant as a function of VOC. The longest electron lifetime is obtained in core–shell heterostructured ETMs, leading to the conclusion that the presence of TiO2 enhances suppression of carrier recombination at the ETM/perovskite interface. The observations of improved carrier diffusion and lifetime support the thesis of enhanced light harvesting by using heterostructured ETMs leading to higher Jsc, VOC and FF as well.22,23

3. Conclusions
In summary, a simple and low temperature solution-processed two-step hydrothermal route was introduced to grow the core–shell heterostructured ETMs based on TiO2 shell formed on high aspect ratio ZnO nanorods (1 μm in length) formed on FTO/glass substrates. These core–shell heterostructured ETMs were used in lead iodide perovskite devices and demonstrated a maximum PCE as high as 15.3% in hysteresis-free devices. This is the highest efficiency reported to date for perovskite solar cells based on heterostructured mesoscale metal oxide ETMs. The high aspect ratio heterostructured ZnO/TiO2 ETM developed in this study promotes perovskite infiltration, provides a larger internal contact area, and the TiO2-coated ZNRs promote a reduced recombination rate, which results in superior light harvesting capability to 1D ZnO nanorod arrays. The ZnO/TiO2 core–shell heterostructure has credibly shown benefits in terms of better absorber material loading, and rapid electron transport making it suitable for applications beyond photovoltaics, such as in optoelectronics, energy storage and photocatalysis.
4. Experimental
Synthesis of low and high aspect ratio (AR) ZnO nanorods (ZNRs)
The low and high AR ZNRs were synthesized directly on the fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrates using a two-step method as reported previously.25,28 Firstly, FTO substrates were ultrasonically cleaned with deionized water, ethanol and acetone repeatedly. Then the ZnO seed layer was deposited on the FTO substrates via electrospray as explained previously.28 A 0.05 M solution of zinc acetate dehydrate (Zn (O2CCH3)2(H2O)2) in a mixture of ethanol–water solvents was sprayed at a fixed flow rate of 0.005 mL min−1, with a high voltage of 6.1 kV and a distance of 4 cm was maintained between the nozzle and the substrate during precursor spraying. Hot plate temperature was well-maintained at 210 °C to evaporate the solvent mixture efficiently. The hydrothermal growth solution was prepared by dissolving zinc nitrate hexahydrate (Zn(NO3)2·6H2O) and hexamethylenetetramine (HMTA) in 100 mL deionized water to give a concentration of Zn(NO3)2 of 25 mmol L−1 and a 1:1 molar ratio of Zn(NO3)2:HMTA. The ZNRs were grown on the FTO substrates from the electrosprayed coated ZnO seed layer by immersing them in the above solution and heated at 70 °C in an autoclave for 120 minutes. After 2 hours of reaction, the autoclave was allowed to cool down naturally and the FTO substrates with ZNRs were taken out and rinsed thoroughly with ethanol and dried with nitrogen gas for further use. High AR ZNRs were grown in the same fashion as described above. However, to grow thinner rods with smaller diameters a 5 mM polyethylenimine (PEI) was also added into the growth solution under continuous magnetic stirring.
Synthesis of low and high aspect ratio (AR) ZNR/TS heterostructured hybrid arrays
TiO2 shells (TS) were grown on the ZNR surfaces using the modified version of Lou's synthesis scheme as reported previously.36 The FTO substrates covered with low and high AR ZNRs were placed in an autoclave, which contained a mixture of 0.03 mL diethylenetriamine (DETA), 42 mL isopropyl alcohol and 1.5 mL of titanium(IV) isopropoxide. The autoclave was sealed properly and heated to 180 °C for 12 h in a laboratory oven. After that, the autoclave was naturally cooled to ambient temperature. Samples were washed carefully with ethanol to remove the extra residue and finally annealed at 450 °C for 2 h to form the pure TiO2 crystal structure.
Perovskite film and cell fabrication
A sequential deposition method was used to fill the perovskite into 1D core–shell heterostructured hybrid arrays.18 Lead iodide (PbI2) was completely dissolved in DMF under continuous stirring at 70 °C to produce a concentration of 460 mg mL−1. Then the PbI2 solution in DMF was infiltrated into the low AR ZNR, high AR ZNR, low AR ZNR/TS and high AR ZNR/TS mesoscale ETMs by spin coating it over them, at 3000 rpm for 30 s following drying at 70 °C for 30 minutes. After 30 minutes, samples were allowed to cool down to room temperature and then the samples were rinsed in isopropyl alcohol (IPA) solution for 3 s and eventually immersed into the methyl ammonium iodide (CH3NH3I) solution in IPA (with a concentration of 10 mg mL−1) followed by rinsing in IPA solution again. Samples were dried in air and heated at 70 °C for 30 minutes. A hole-transporting material (HTM) was prepared by mixing 75 mg of (2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9-spirobifluorene) (spiro-MeOTAD), 28 μL of 4-tert-butylpyridine, and 17 μL of solution that contains 520 mg mL−1 of lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide in acetonitrile into 1 mL of chlorobenzene. A 25 μL spiro-MeOTAD solution was spin-coated on the perovskite layer at 3000 rpm for 30 s. Finally, a 90 nm thick gold layer was thermally evaporated on the HTM as a back contact.
Characterization
The film thickness, cross-sectional and surface views of the as-grown mesoporous ETLs and complete devices were examined by using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, Magellan 400 FEI). The formation of ZnO, TiO2 and perovskite phases was confirmed through X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis (Model M18XHF, Mac Science Instruments). The presence of TiO2 shell on the ZNR surfaces was confirmed by using a transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEOL JEM-3000F). The current–voltage characteristics (J–V curves) were obtained with a Keithley Model 2420 Digital Sourcemeter (Keithley Instruments, Inc.,USA) under illumination of 100 mW cm−2 (AM 1.5) provided using a solar simulator (Oriel AAA Solar Simulator, USA). Both the forward and reverse scans were used with a rate of 10 mV per 200 ms and a delay time of 200 ms. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurement was performed using an EQE measurement kit (Newport Corporation, CA). Time constant responses for recombination and electron transport were obtained using a transient photocurrent–voltage setup.
