    , Accepted 20th November 2017First published on 20th November 2017AbstractThe ever-increasing demand for energy storage in portable electronic devices is driving research on supercapacitor technology. In this context, optical transparency and mechanical robustness of supercapacitors are the key properties for the development of next-generation multifunctional devices, such as head-up displays, high-aesthetic touch screens and monolithic energy conversion/storage integrated systems. Here, we demonstrate that indium tin oxide nanoparticles (ITO NPs) are ideal materials for a facile solution-processed fabrication of transparent/semi-transparent electrodes with high areal capacitance (Careal) in aqueous solutions (1 M Na2SO4), overcoming the crucial trade-off between optical transparency and areal supercapacitor performance. In particular, our ITO NP electrodes exhibit Careal values of 0.40, 0.72 1.53, 3.41, and 6.45 mF cm−2 at 0.2 mA cm−2 for a transmittance (T) of 81.9%, 69.7%, 64.4%, 46.6% and 26.7% at 550 nm, respectively. The Careal values at current densities higher than 1.2 mA cm−2 are record-high (i.e., 0.81, 1.76 and 3.17 mF cm−2 at 10 mA cm−2 for a T of 64.4%, 46.6% and 26.7% at 550 nm). Indium tin oxide nanoparticle electrodes show 94% capacitance retention over 10000 charge–discharge cycles. Flexible electrodes are also designed on a polyethylene terephthalate substrate, showing operational activity over 100 bending cycles under curvature radii of 1 and 0.5 cm. Finally, the coating of the ITO NP electrode with a photoactive polymer, i.e., rr-poly(3-hexylthiophene), permits the fabrication of a light-powered supercapacitor, as a clear-cut case of an innovative hybrid electric power delivery device, storing an energy density of 17.54 nW h cm−2 under simulated sunlight illumination.
Today more than ever, transparent energy conversion and storage devices have attracted increasing attention due to their great potential as integrated power sources for the multifunctional displays and windows of portable electronics, buildings, automobiles and aerospace vehicles. In this context, the development of transparent supercapacitors is pivotal for addressing the aforementioned technologies.1,2 Thus, the question arises: “how to play with both transparency and high areal specific energy in supercapacitors?” Actually, this sounds like “the tail wagging the dog”, i.e., it means to go up against the crucial bottleneck of such devices. In fact, the most promising supercapacitor materials in terms of specific (gravimetric) capacitance (Cs), such as carbon-based materials,1,2 conducting polymers1,3 and metal oxides,1,4,5 preserve optical transparency by adopting mass loading in the order of ∼10 μg cm−2, thus resulting in very low areal capacitance (Careal).6–16 Indeed, the achievement of a high mass loading (e.g., >100 μg cm−2) of active materials while preserving both large surface area and electrode transparency is the major challenge. For example, recent studies have shown impressive Cs (up to ∼110 F g−1 at 10 mV s−1)6 by using graphene1–4 and carbon nanotubes (CNTs)5 thanks to their specific surface area (∼2630 m2 g−1 for graphene17–20 and 1320 m2 g−1 for CNTs21,22). As a counter-balance, limited electrode mass loading in the 1–10 μg cm−2 range for transmittance (T) over 60%6–10 at 550 nm led to Careal in the order of 10 μF cm−2.6–10 Recently, improvements in the design of supercapacitors and/or nano-engineering of carbon films marked a turning point for addressing high Careal (i.e., ≥1 mF cm−2) also for limited intrinsic mass loading.11–15 In particular, transparent ultrathin planar supercapacitors based on multilayer reduced graphene oxide obtained through layer-by-layer (LBL) assembly achieved a Careal of 394 μF cm−2 at a current density of 281 nA cm−2.12 By adopting a 3D-structured design, supercapacitors based on highly textured graphitic films in porous templates achieved a Careal of 409 μF cm−2 at a current density of 5 μA cm−2.13 Self-supporting transparent graphene films with wrinkled-graphene-assembled open-hollow polyhedron building units have shown a remarkable electrode Careal of 4.21 and 2.15 mF cm−2 at a current density of 0.1 and 0.4 mA cm−2, respectively.15 Notably, these last current densities are between 1 and 3 orders of magnitude larger than those used for measuring the aforementioned capacitance values (i.e., 281 nA cm−2 for 394 μF cm−2, and 5 μA cm−2 for 818 μF cm−2).12,13 However, the overall advances rely on complex manufacturing processes, e.g., chemical vapour deposition (CVD) of carbon-based materials on nanostructured anodic aluminium oxide templates13 or microwave plasma-enhanced CVD.14,15 Alternative routes for obtaining scalable transparent supercapacitors explored the incorporation of pseudo-capacitive conducting polymers, such as polyaniline (PANI),23,24 poly(pyrrole) (Ppy)24 and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT)25 or transition metal oxides/hydroxides, such as In2O3,25 FeOOH26 and Co(OH)2 into CNT- or graphene-based films.26 Although remarkable Cs values have been demonstrated (i.e., up to 234 F g−1 at 1 A g−1),23 the low mass loading usually adopted, ∼10 μg cm−2,23–25 still limits the supercapacitor areal performance, while the pseudo-capacitive behaviour limits high operational current densities (<1 mA cm−2). So far, only Zhang and co-workers26 have reported remarkable asymmetric semi-transparent (T = 50.5% at 550 nm) supercapacitor electrodes with a Careal of 10.69 mF cm−2 at a current density of 1.2 mA cm−2 and a promising cycling stability (capacitance retention of 83.5% after 10000 cycles). These values approach those of non-transparent architectures,27,28 including electrochromic pseudo-capacitive glass windows.29 Recently, flexible transparent nanopaper assembled via ultralong MoO3 nanobelts achieved a Careal of 91 mF cm−2 at 2 mV s−1. However, Careal significantly decreased by increasing the voltage scan rate, as a consequence of the intrinsic pseudo-capacitive nature of MoO3.30 Moreover, the whole electrodes included a non-transparent metal (Au) collector in order to avoid equivalent series resistance (ESR)-related capacitive loss of self-standing nanopaper.30
All the aforementioned considerations and examples evidence that it is essential to focus the research of transparent supercapacitors on materials which, besides their electrical conductive and capacitive properties, ensure optical transparency at high mass loading (e.g., >0.1 mg cm−2). To tackle this long-standing issue, we exploit commercially available indium tin oxide nanoparticles (ITO NPs) to design and fabricate state-of-the-art transparent supercapacitors in terms of Careal, power density (i.e., operational current densities exceeding 1 mA cm−2) and cycling stability. Actually, ITO thin films have high T (∼90% in the visible range)31 and high electrical conductivity (∼104 S cm−1).32,33 Moreover, these (opto)electronic properties have been recently demonstrated also for ITO films obtained by solution-deposition methods from ITO NPs.34 This dispersion avoids the conventional fabrication of ITO films using physical vapour deposition (PVD) techniques (e.g., sputtering35–40 and pulsed laser deposition41–43), electron beam evaporation44–47 and CVD,48–50 making the fabrication of ITO films very expensive, thus limiting the industrial scaling up of the technology.
The chemical, structural and morphological characterization of commercial ITO NPs is carried out by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM), respectively (see ESI, Fig. S1 and S2†). Briefly, ITO NPs display a cubic-like shape51 with lateral dimensions <50 nm (lognormal distribution peaking at 3.99 nm and a standard deviation of 0.89 nm) and a body-centred cubic bixbyite In2O3 structure, without formation of SnO2.52,53 The ITO NP electrodes are obtained by drop-casting nanoparticle dispersions in ethanol on top of a 100 nm thick ITO FLAT substrate (area of 1 × 1.5 cm2, and a sheet resistance of 20 Ω □−1), thus producing mesoporous architectures (see the following discussion on surface area data), as previously reported for ITO NP films without a post-deposition sintering process.55 By controlling the concentration and the amount of the drop-cast ITO NP dispersions, we fabricate electrodes with different ITO NP mass loadings, i.e., 0.015, 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 1 and 2 mg cm−2. The T spectra obtained for each mesoporous electrode are shown in Fig. 1a and show that T decreases with the mass loading increase. At 550 nm, the T is 86.2% for ITO FLAT, and 81.9%, 69.7%, 64.4%, 46.6% and 26.7% for the electrodes with 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 1 and 2 mg cm−2 ITO NP mass loading, respectively.
 Fig. 1  (a) Transmittance spectra of the electrodes with different ITO NP mass loadings (0, 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 1 and 2 mg cm−2) on a 100 nm thick ITO FLAT substrate. (b) Plot of absorbance at 550 nm vs. ITO NP mass loading (black squares). The linear fitting is also shown (red line). (c) Photograph of the electrodes (area 1 × 1.5 cm2) with different ITO NP mass loadings (0, 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 1 and 2 mg cm−2 from left to right). 
Notably, the absorbance of the electrodes at 550 nm increases linearly with the ITO NP mass loading (Fig. 1b). This means that uniform ITO NP coverage of the ITO FLAT is obtained, and the ITO NP mass loading is proportional to the ITO NP film thickness, in agreement with the Beer–Lambert law.55 The photographs of the electrodes (area 1 × 1.5 cm2) with different ITO NP mass loadings (0, 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 1 and 2 mg cm−2) are shown in Fig. 1c. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area56 of the starting ITO NPs as well as of the as-prepared electrodes is obtained by using Kr physisorption performed at 77 K.57,58 The BET specific surface area of ITO NP powder is 25 ± 1 m2 g−1. Similarly, the BET specific surface area of ITO NPs on the electrodes is 25 ± 2 m2 g−1, independently from the ITO NP mass loading (measurement on mass loading of 0.125 mg cm−2 is excluded due to the accuracy issue related to the minimum absolute surface area detectable by the BET instrumentation). These results exclude ITO NP aggregation after post-deposition solvent evaporation. Notably, we determine a 61, 119, 249 and 542-fold-enhancement of the surface area of the electrodes with 0.25, 0.5, 1 and 2 mg cm−2 ITO NP mass loading, respectively, compared to the geometrical surface area. This means that a significant increase of Careal with ITO NP mass loading is also expected.54 Resistivity measurements are carried out by a four probe method59 on mesoporous ITO NP films (mass loading of 0.5 mg cm−2) deposited directly on to a glass substrate. The average resistivity of mesoporous ITO NP films is 2.60 ± 0.13 Ω cm, which corresponds to a sheet resistance of 74 ± 5 kΩ □−1. The latter one is three orders of magnitude larger than the sheet resistance of the ITO FLAT (20 ± 2 Ω □−1), and thus dominates the ESR of the electrodes,60,61 as given by the parallel between the ITO NP film and ITO FLAT substrate resistances.60,61 It is worth mentioning that the high resistivity obtained for the ITO NP film is in agreement with the values reported in the literature for solution-processed ITO NP films without post-deposition sintering at high temperature (≥300 °C).62–64 The mesoporous nature of ITO NPs can in principle modify the position and/or occupancy levels of their electronic states.65 Kelvin Probe (KP) measurements are carried out in order to estimate the work function (WF) of the ITO FLAT substrates (compact morphology) and ITO NP films (mesoporous morphology). The WF values measured for the ITO FLAT and ITO NP films are comparable, being 4.5 ± 0.1 and 4.6 ± 0.1 eV respectively. This indicates that the different morphologies of ITO FLAT and ITO NP films have negligible effects on their electronic structures, in agreement with literature data.54 The morphology of the electrodes is evaluated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) measurements (Fig. 2).

The top-view SEM images acquired at increasing magnification on an electrode with an ITO NP mass loading of 0.5 mg cm−2 (Fig. 2a–d) clearly show its mesoporous structure, demonstrating full ITO NP coverage of the ITO FLAT substrate. No significant differences are observed in the top-view images of the ITO NP electrodes with different mass loadings at these magnifications (Fig. S3†), while aggregation effects are visible at lower magnification on electrodes with an ITO NP mass loading of 2 mg cm−2 (Fig. S4), see ESI† for details. The cross-sectional SEM images of the electrode with an ITO NP mass loading of 1 mg cm−2 at different magnifications (Fig. 2e and f) show its layered structure, consisting of a 100 nm ITO FLAT substrate coated by a 700–800 nm mesoporous ITO NP film.
To evaluate the supercapacitor performance of the ITO NP electrodes, cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge/discharge (CD) measurements in 1 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution are carried out in a three-electrode configuration. Fig. 3a shows the CV data obtained at a scan rate of 1 V s−1 for the electrodes with different ITO NP mass loadings. The nearly-rectangular CV shapes and the absence of redox peaks indicate that the electrodes show double-layer capacitive behaviour66–70 in the potential range between −0.2 and 1 V vs. Ag/AgCl. This potential range avoids irreversible redox reactions (reduction towards metallic species,71–74 corrosion,75,76 and O2-evolution77,78), which may cause degradation of both the electrical conductivity and T of the electrodes, as previously reported.71–78 The CV curve for the ITO FLAT electrode extending to a potential range between −0.4 and 1.2 V vs. Ag/AgCl (Fig. S5†) evidences the presence of reduction and oxidation reactions below −0.2 V vs. Ag/AgCl and above 1 V vs. Ag/AgCl, respectively. This justifies further the choice of the potential range used for our electrode characterization. The different size of the solvated ions (0.35 nm for Na+ and 0.73 nm for SO42−)79–82 and the possible presence of steric hindrance can account for asymmetry of the CV shapes.79,83 The current densities increase linearly with the ITO NP mass loading, as expected from the corresponding growth of the BET surface area. The CV curves at different scan rates (from 0.01 to 10 V s−1) for the electrode with an ITO NP mass loading of 0.25 mg cm−2 are shown in Fig. 3b. It is worth noting that the electrode capacitive behaviour is preserved also at the highest scan rate (10 V s−1), thus suggesting a high-power capability.84–86 The CV curves at different scan rates for the electrodes with different ITO NP mass loadings are shown in Fig. S6,† attesting that CV shapes become increasingly biconvex (lens-shaped) at scan rates higher than 5 V s−1 for the highest ITO NP mass loadings (i.e., 1 and 2 mg cm−2). This means that only a fraction of capacitive states hold on with the applied voltage for current densities above 5 mA cm−2.66–70 The galvanostatic CD curves (Fig. 3c) for electrodes with different ITO NP mass loadings at a current density of 0.2 mA cm−2 show nearly triangular shapes, thus confirming the double-layer capacitive behaviour of the electrode66–70 evidenced by the CV measurements. The galvanostatic CD curves at different current densities (from 0.05 to 10 mA cm−2) for the electrode with an ITO NP mass loading of 0.25 mg cm−2 are shown in Fig. 3d, while those for the electrodes with the other ITO NP mass loadings (0.125, 0.5, 1 and 2 mg cm−2) are reported in the ESI (Fig. S7†). The Careal of the electrodes can be calculated from the galvanostatic CD curves using the equation Careal = |i|td/AgeomΔV,66,83,87 where |i| is the module of the applied current (i), td is the discharge time, Ageom is the geometrical area and ΔV is the voltage window of the measurement. The obtained Careal values increase with the ITO NP mass loading due to the corresponding increase of the surface area. In particular, Careal values of 0.40, 0.72, 1.53, 3.41, and 6.45 mF cm−2 at 0.2 mA cm−2 are obtained for the electrodes with ITO NP mass loadings of 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 1 and 2 mg cm−2, respectively. The cycling stability of a representative electrode (ITO NP mass loading of 0.25 mg cm−2) is tested over 10000 CD cycles at a current density of 1 mA cm−2 (Fig. S8†). The excellent capacitance retention (99%, 97% and 94% over 100, 1000 and 1000 cycles, respectively) (Fig. 3e) indicates the absence of mechanical breakdown, which could be due to the swelling of the electrode88–90 or mechanical strain during CD cycling.88–91 Moreover, the coulombic efficiency, calculated as the ratio between td and tc (charging time), of ∼100% for every cycle (Fig. 3e) means that the capacitive performance is not limited by parasitic chemical reactions.88–92 Thus, these results evidence an excellent cycling stability, which represents a fundamental requirement in practical application.68,93–95Fig. 3f shows the comparison of the ITO NP electrodes with the ones in transparent supercapacitors reported in the literature. Notably, for the case of the supercapacitor with an ITO NP mass loading of 0.5 mg cm−2, whose T is 64.4% at 550 nm, the Careal values exceed most of the ones reported recently for transparent carbon-based electrodes.2,3,5,7,8 These values also approach the ones obtained at the same current values for state-of-the-art transparent supercapacitor electrodes based on pseudo-capacitive materials16–22 (FeOOH and Co(OH)2).26 Moreover, the Careal values of 0.81, 1.76 and 3.17 mF cm−2 at 10 mA cm−2 obtained for the electrodes with ITO NP mass loadings of 0.5, 1 and 2 mg cm−2 represent the current high-record values for transparent/semi-transparent electrodes at comparable current densities (maximum current density tested previously is 1.2 mA cm−2).14 The Careal losses observed with increasing the current density could be ascribed to the potential drops in the ESR.66–70 The ESR can be calculated by the galvanostatic CD curves, using the equation ESR = Vdrop/j, where Vdrop is the voltage drop at half-cycle of the CD curve and j is the applied current density (i.e., j = i/Ageom).66–69,83,87 The ESR values of the electrodes are 27 ± 3 Ω and they do not change upon ITO NP mass loading variation (see ESI, Fig. S9†). These values are comparable to those of the ITO FLAT sheet resistance (20 ± 2 Ω □−1), which means that the electrode ESRs are mainly limited by the resistances of the ITO FLAT substrates.60,61 The same conclusion is derived by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements of the ITO FLAT and ITO NP electrodes, whose details are reported in the ESI (Fig. S10†).

(d) CD curves of the electrode with an ITO NP mass loading of 0.25 mg cm−2 at different current densities (from 0.05 to 10 mA cm−2). (e) Capacitance retention (black spheres) and coulombic efficiency (red spheres) obtained from the galvanostatic CD curves at 1 mA cm−2 over 10000 cycles for a representative electrode with an ITO NP mass loading of 0.25 mg cm−2. (f) Dependence of the Careal on the charging/discharging current density for the electrodes with different ITO NP mass loadings. Comparison with the adapted data originally published in the most recent studies is also shown (diamonds, triangles and stars for carbon based-electrodes (ref. 7, 8 and 10), nanostructured carbon based-electrodes (ref. 12, 13 and 15) and pseudo-capacitive material based-electrodes (ref. 23–26) respectively). 
The physicochemical properties of the 1 M Na2SO4 solution such as the viscosity, solubility and dimension of solvated ions could also contribute to the ESR.79,87 The use of more conductive transparent substrates is actually challenging,96,97 but it could, in principle, permit the extension of the capacitive activity of the electrodes at higher current densities (>10 mA cm−2). To demonstrate the feasibility of this approach, we fabricated an electrode of 1 mg cm−2 ITO NP mass loading on a 30 nm thick Au substrate (sheet resistance of 4 ± 1 Ω □−1). The corresponding galvanostatic CD curves are reported in the ESI (Fig. S11†). Their analysis at 1 mA cm−2 (Fig. S9a†) gives an ESR value of ∼5 Ω, permitting the achievement of a Careal of 2.37 (1.65) mF cm−2 at 20 (50) mA cm−2, thus enhancing the Careal of the electrode fabricated on ITO FLAT (i.e., 1.02 (0.54) mF cm−2) of 132% (205%), see Fig. S8b,† at high current densities.
The ITO NP electrodes are also fabricated on ITO-coated polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrates (Fig. S12a†). Fig. S12b† shows the capacitance retention plots over bending-type stresses with different radii of curvature (R). Notably, the Careal of a representative ITO NP electrode (ITO NP mass loading of 1 mg cm−2) increases by 25.4% compared to the initial values (2.96 mF cm−2) after the first bending cycle at R = 1 cm. This can be tentatively attributed to a favourable mesoscopic rearrangement of the ITO NPs. Afterward, the Careal progressively stabilizes at 3.94 mF cm−2 over 100 bending cycles. For R = 0.5 cm, the capacitance decreases mainly during the first bending cycles, retaining 67.8% of its initial value after 100 bending cycles. These results prove that the electrode can be well-suited for a wide range of applications in flexible electronics.98–102
A symmetric supercapacitor assembled with two ITO NP electrodes (ITO NP mass loading of 1 mg cm−2 for each electrode) is then tested between 0 and 1 V. The width of the voltage window of the symmetric ITO NP supercapacitor measurements is reduced compared to that of the potential window of three-electrode tests (from 1.2 V to 1 V) in order to avoid possible electrochemical reactions occurring in the presence of non-ideal electrode Careal balancing. Fig. 4a shows the CV curves of the ITO NP supercapacitor obtained at different scan rates (from 0.01 to 10 V s−1). For scan rates up to 1 V s−1, the supercapacitor exhibits rectangular-shaped CV curves, in agreement with the double-layer capacitive behaviour measured for the single electrode (Fig. 3a–d). At higher scan rates (5 and 10 V s−1), the biconvex CV shape is ascribed to the ESR-related capacitive loss.66–70 However, capacitive behaviour is still observed, indicating high-power capability.84–86Fig. 4b shows the galvanostatic CD curves of the symmetric supercapacitor at different current densities (from 0.05 to 5 mA cm−2). The triangular-shaped curves indicate, again, the electrochemical double-layer behaviour of the supercapacitor. The Careal values calculated from CD curve analysis show that Careal decreases with the applied current density (Fig. S13†). This is ascribed to the ESR-related losses,66–70 as for the cases of the single electrodes. The ESR value, as estimated from the CD curves, is 60 ± 5 Ω. This is given by the sum of the sheet resistances of the ITO FLAT substrates and the electrolyte resistance.79,83 The Careal values at current densities lower than 1 mA cm−2 are ∼2 times lower than those of the single electrodes with an ITO NP mass loading of 1 mg cm−2. In fact, the Careal of the symmetric supercapacitor is the series of those of the two single electrodes.66,70

(c) Sketch of the architecture of the LP-S, obtained by infiltrating rr-P3HT into the ITO NPs of one electrode of the supercapacitor. (d) Open-circuit voltage measurements after switching on (solid black line) and switching off (dashed grey line) the simulated sunlight illumination. The time constant of the exponential photo-charging (τc) and self-discharging (τd) are also indicated. 
A monolithic light powered-supercapacitor (LP-S) (showing self-powering capability under solar illumination) is designed in order to exploit both the optical and electrochemical performance of the proposed supercapacitor. The LP-S is obtained by infiltrating a photo-active polymer, i.e., regio-regular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (rr-P3HT) into one supercapacitor electrode (ITO NP mass loading of 1 mg cm−2). Actually, rr-P3HT has a direct bandgap of 1.9 eV,103,104 thus being able to absorb visible light between 350 and 700 nm wavelength.105–107 Furthermore, the optoelectronic properties of rr-P3HT, such as light absorption and charge photo-generation, are fully retained in aqueous solutions.109–112 Recently, ITO FLAT and ITO NP electrodes coated by rr-P3HT have been exploited for controlling the electrical capacitive signal generated at the interface between rr-P3HT and aqueous electrolytes for biological applications.54,113–115 Thus, inspired by these latter findings, a LP-S is obtained by spin coating the rr-P3HT solution in chlorobenzene onto the ITO NPs. The architecture of the LP-S is depicted in Fig. 4c. The T spectra of the ITO NP electrode before and after rr-P3HT infiltration are shown in Fig. S14,† showing that the rr-P3HT effectively absorbs visible light in the 350–700 nm wavelength range.105–108 The infiltration of rr-P3HT does not affect the morphology, i.e., the surface area, of the ITO NP electrode. In fact, the BET surface area measurements of the electrode before and after rr-P3HT deposition provide comparable values in both cases (250 ± 10 cm2 and 240 ± 20 cm2, respectively), in agreement with previous studies of EIS and SEM.54 To characterize the photo-charging property of the LP-S, open circuit voltage across the two electrodes is measured over time after starting simulated sunlight illumination (1.5AM, 100 mW cm−2). As shown in Fig. 4d, the voltage of the LP-S increased when the light is switched on, until reaching a stable value of ∼0.19 V. This means that when the LP-S is under illumination, the rr-P3HT generates electron–hole pairs (i.e., excitons) because of its photovoltaic effect as a polymer semiconductor.116,117 The interaction between rr-P3HT and ITO NPs causes exciton separation. In fact, holes are collected by ITO NPs, while electrons attract positive ions from the electrolyte, thus charging the LP-S (Fig. 4a). The supercapacitor is continuously charged by the photocurrent until a constant potential is reached. The energy density stored in the LP-S under illumination, as calculated by E = CV2/2, is 17.54 nW h cm−2 (by approximating Careal to 3.5 mF cm−2, in accordance with the Careal values obtained at current densities between 0.05 and 0.2 mA cm−2). The capacitor charging grows exponentially with a time constant (τc) of ∼10 s, while self-discharging occurs with a time constant (τd) of ∼275 s (Fig. 4d). Notably, the photo-charging effect of the LP-S is not aided by external bias voltages, which is different from self-powered photo-sensors.118,119 Indeed, our LP-S is able to work similarly to supercapacitor–solar cell hybrids,120–123 but, most importantly, without requiring additional connecting circuitry. Moreover, the optical semi-transparency of the ITO NP electrode without rr-P3HT guarantees the use of the LP-S for applications such as displays, where it can assist the power source. To sum up, the LP-S effectively integrates a transparent energy storage system with a photo-charging device, opening the door to the design of highly integrated, next-generation power source-sensor systems.
In conclusion, by exploiting the optical and electrochemical properties of solution-processed ITO NPs, we fabricated state-of-the art transparent supercapacitors with high-record Careal at current densities superior to 1.2 mA cm−2 and a Careal retention of 94% over 10000 CD cycles. Thus, we successfully overcome the trade-off between transparency and high-areal capacitance. This is a breakthrough in the field of transparent supercapacitor research, where devices show high gravimetric but low areal performance. Moreover, our supercapacitors are obtained without exploiting both hardly scalable manufacturing processes (i.e., incompatible with high-throughput industrial implementation) and pseudo-capacitive materials (which usually limit the capacitive behaviour at high current densities e.g., above 1 mA cm−2).69,124 We also highlight that our results are even more remarkable considering that our record capacitive performance for transparent electrodes has been achieved with commercial ITO NPs endowing a small surface area (∼25 m2 g−1). If from one hand this is surprising, from the other hand it also means that the capacitive performance of ITO NP electrodes could be improved by optimizing the ITO NP synthesis, i.e., achieving a higher surface area compared to that of commercial ones. The operational activity of the electrode is also proved on a flexible substrate over 100 bending cycles at R values of 1 and 0.5 cm. Lastly, our symmetric ITO NP supercapacitor is exploited for the fabrication of an innovative high-power delivering LP-S capable of storing an energy density of 17.54 nW h cm−2 under simulated sunlight illumination. Thus, we believe that our work offers new insights in the field of transparent supercapacitors, bringing true breakthroughs for their establishment in novel hybrid electric power delivery devices.

(b) Plot of absorbance at 550 nm vs. ITO NP mass loading (black squares). The linear fitting is also shown (red line). (c) Photograph of the electrodes (area 1 × 1.5 cm2) with different ITO NP mass loadings (0, 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 1 and 2 mg cm−2 from left to right).	 

 	Fig. 2  (a–d) Top-view SEM images of the ITO NP electrode (mass loading of 0.5 mg cm−2) with increasing magnification. (e and f) Cross-sectional SEM images of the ITO NP electrode (mass loading of 1 mg cm−2), showing its layered structure (∼100 nm ITO FLAT + ∼700–800 nm ITO NPs).	 

 	Fig. 3  (a) CV curves of the electrodes with different ITO NP mass loadings (from 0 to 2 mg cm−2) at a scan rate of 1 V s−1. (b) The CV curves of the electrode with an ITO NP mass loading of 0.25 mg cm−2 at different scan rates (from 0.01 V to 10 V s−1). (c) The CD curves of the electrode with different ITO NP mass loadings (from 0.125 to 2 mg cm−2) at a current density of 0.2 mA cm−2. (d) CD curves of the electrode with an ITO NP mass loading of 0.25 mg cm−2 at different current densities (from 0.05 to 10 mA cm−2). (e) Capacitance retention (black spheres) and coulombic efficiency (red spheres) obtained from the galvanostatic CD curves at 1 mA cm−2 over 10000 cycles for a representative electrode with an ITO NP mass loading of 0.25 mg cm−2. (f) Dependence of the Careal on the charging/discharging current density for the electrodes with different ITO NP mass loadings. Comparison with the adapted data originally published in the most recent studies is also shown (diamonds, triangles and stars for carbon based-electrodes (ref. 7, 8 and 10), nanostructured carbon based-electrodes (ref. 12, 13 and 15) and pseudo-capacitive material based-electrodes (ref. 23–26) respectively).	 

 	Fig. 4  (a) CV curves (scan rate from 0.01 V to 10 V s−1) and (b) CD curves (current densities from 0.05 to 10 mA cm−2) for the symmetric supercapacitor (single electrode ITO NP mass loading of 1 mg cm−2). (c) Sketch of the architecture of the LP-S, obtained by infiltrating rr-P3HT into the ITO NPs of one electrode of the supercapacitor. (d) Open-circuit voltage measurements after switching on (solid black line) and switching off (dashed grey line) the simulated sunlight illumination. The time constant of the exponential photo-charging (τc) and self-discharging (τd) are also indicated.
