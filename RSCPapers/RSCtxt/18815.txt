    , Accepted 28th August 2012First published on 29th August 2012AbstractWe demonstrate series-integrated multijunction organic photovoltaics fabricated monolithically by vapor-deposition in a transposed subcell order with the near-infrared-absorbing subcell in front of the green-absorbing subcell. This transposed subcell order is enabled by the highly complementary absorption spectra of a near-infrared-absorbing visibly-transparent subcell and a visible-absorbing subcell and motivated by the non-spatially-uniform optical intensity in nanoscale photovoltaics. The subcell order and thicknesses are optimized via transfer-matrix formalism and short-circuit current simulations. An efficient charge recombination zone consisting of layers of BCP/Ag/MoOx leads to negligible voltage and series-resistance losses. Under 1-sun illumination the multijunction solar cells exhibit a power conversion efficiency of 5.5 ± 0.2% with an FF of 0.685 ± 0.002 and a VOC of 1.65 ± 0.02 V, corresponding to the sum of the VOC of the component subcells. These devices exhibit a broad spectral response (in the wavelength range of 350 nm to 850 nm) but are limited by subcell external quantum efficiencies between 20% and 30% over the photoactive spectrum.
Introduction
Organic photovoltaics (OPVs) have generated much interest due to their potential as flexible, semi-transparent solar cells. However low power conversion efficiency has thus far limited their commercialization. A major limiting factor is the trade-off between photon absorption and conversion to current and photon energy conversion to voltage, which can be manipulated by the choice of donor and acceptor energy levels. This trade-off can be minimized through implementation of a multijunction (MJ) architecture,1,2 in which multiple subcells of differing optical band gaps lower thermal losses. Organic semiconductors uniquely demonstrate structured absorption spectra, which enable MJ OPVs in which donor materials are transparent to each other.3,4 This minimizes competitive absorption between subcells and enables facile optical device optimization.5,6 Power conversion efficiencies up to 8.6% have been reported for MJ OPVs comprising complementary donor materials.4
Herein we present optical and electrical optimization of an MJ OPV incorporating a near-infrared-absorbing visibly-transparent phthalocyanine-based donor (ClAlPc) and a complementary visible-absorbing perylene-based donor (DBP) (Fig. 1).7–9 These two donor materials are transparent to one another, enabling the positioning of the narrower band-gap cell in front of the wider band-gap subcell in order to optimize optical absorption within the weak optical microcavity of the nanoscale PV.5,6 The subcell thicknesses were computationally optimized for maximum generated photocurrent using T-matrix formalism. These subcells were connected with a variety of recombination zone (RZ) architectures to optimize subcell current recombination and thus minimize charge build-up and voltage loss. Optimization of the structure of the MJ cells leads to open-circuit voltage equal to near perfect summation of the subcell open-circuit voltages (1.65 ± 0.02 V), near maintenance of the high fill factor of the perylene-based subcell (0.685 ± 0.002), broad spectral response (in the wavelength range of 350 nm to 850 nm), and OPV power conversion efficiencies of 5.5 ± 0.2%.

Experimental
The MJ cells are fabricated monolithically entirely by vapor deposition and incorporate chloroaluminum phthalocyanine (ClAlPc) as a near-infrared-absorbing visibly-transparent donor and tetraphenyldibenzoperiflanthene (DBP) as a visible-absorbing donor, with buckminsterfullerene (C60) as a wide bandgap acceptor in both subcells. The photovoltaic devices are fabricated via vacuum thermal evaporation on a solvent cleaned, pre-patterned ITO-coated glass (Thin Film Devices, 20 Ω/□). Prior to device growth, ClAlPc (TCI, C1167) and C60 (Aldrich, sublimed 99.9%) are purified once by vacuum train sublimation, while DBP (Lumtec, LT-N4003), BCP (Lumtec, LT-E304), MoOx (Alfa, 99.9995%), and Ag (Alfa-Aesar, Premion 11357 99.9999%) are used as purchased. The subcell and RZ layers are blanket deposited, while the top Ag electrode is patterned via shadow masking in stripes orthogonal to the bottom ITO electrode to generate a device area of 0.0121 cm2. Each subcell and each RZ are fabricated without breaking high-vacuum (<10−5 Torr), and all fabrication transfer and characterization is performed in the controlled environment of N2-filled gloveboxes. The multijunction (MJ) cells structure consists of glass/ITO 150 nm/MoOx 20 nm/(subcell1)/(RZ)/(subcell2)/BCP 6.5 nm/Ag 1100 nm. Single junction (SJ) cells with structure glass/ITO 150 nm/MoOx 20 nm/(subcell)/BCP 6.5 nm/Ag 1100 nm are fabricated in parallel with MJ cells in order to characterize the opto-electrical response of individual subcells. A planar-mixed heterojunction of ClAlPc and C60 comprises subcell 1 (SC1) and a planar heterojunction of DBP and C60 comprises subcell 2 (SC2). The optimal SJ configuration (highest ηP in a SJ architecture) of subcell1 (SC1) is ClAlPc 10 nm/ClAlPc:C60 (1:1 ratio) 10 nm/C60 20 nm, and the SC1 in an optimal MJ cell consists of ClAlPc 11.4 nm/ClAlPc:C60 (1:1 ratio) 7.2 nm/C60 9.6 nm. The optimal SJ configuration of subcell2 (SC2) is DBP 20 nm/C60 40 nm, and the SC2 in an optimal MJ cell is DBP 20 nm/C60 23.2 nm. Film thicknesses are measured during film growth using a quartz-crystal monitor pre-calibrated by thin film measurement with a profiler (KLA Tencor, P-16+), leading to a film thickness error of ±1 nm.
Current density–voltage characteristics are measured under dark conditions and under 1 sun illumination (100 mW cm−2, AM 1.5G), using a 150 W solar simulator (Newport, 6255) illuminated through a AM1.5G filter (Newport, 81094) calibrated with an NREL-certified monocrystalline-Si photodiode (Newport, 91150V). Results are not corrected for spectral mismatch. Electrical characteristics are measured using a picoammeter (Keithley, 6487) employing a switch mainframe (Keithley, 7001) for switching between cells. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) is measured with AC monochromatic light and DC light bias (Fig. S1, ESI†). For MJ cells, the measured photocurrent is equivalent to the response of the current-limiting subcell, thus the DC illumination wavelengths and intensities are selected such that the designated subcell is under 1 sun conditions and the other subcell is over-illuminated so that its photocurrent is limited by the designated sub-cell.10–12 The two subcells are complementary light absorbers (i.e. with limited absorption spectrum overlap) resulting in a distinct span of the excitation wavelengths for each subcell. The EQE shown here was taken while illuminating with AC monochromatic light signals scanned from wavelength λ = 350 nm to 900 nm at ∼2 mW and 353 Hz (using Oriel, 100 W Xe arc lamp, 66921 and Princeton Instruments, SpectraPro 300i with a light chopper) and DC solar simulation light bias at 100 mW cm−2 (Newport, 6255) and DC monochromatic light bias of λ = 532 nm (absorbed predominately by DBP) at 50 mW, CW (Extreme Lasers, GHQ-50 ×1). The AC light intensity is calibrated with an NREL-certified Si photodiode (Newport, 818-UV). Electrical characteristics are measured using a lock-in amplifier (Stanford Research Systems, SR830) employing a switch mainframe (Keithley, 7001) for switching between devices.
We apply T-matrix formalism to model the wavelength-resolved optical field intensities within the full MJ cell structure and from these solve the 1D exciton diffusion equations to calculate short-circuit currents as a function of layer configurations.13 The optical properties of each material are measured via spectroscopic ellipsometry (J. A. Woollam, M-2000S). Ideal dissociation and charge collection efficiencies are assumed and exciton diffusion lengths are extracted from fitting single junction EQE thickness dependencies. Numerical optimization of tandem structures is performed by calculating the MJ photoresponse for cells over a series of SC1 and SC2 donor and acceptor thicknesses (4 variables).
Results

Fig. 2 shows representative device characteristics of the empirically optimized MJ cell and its component subcells in the SJ architecture. Fig. 2a shows the current density–voltage characteristics of the optimal MJ cell and SJ cells fabricated in parallel with the subcells of the shown MJ under dark conditions and under illumination of the simulated solar spectrum (100 mW cm−2, AM1.5G, not corrected for spectral mismatch). The VOC of the MJ cell (1.65 ± 0.02 V) is equal to the sum of those of the SJ cells (1.64 ± 0.01 V), and the FF (0.685 ± 0.002) is within error of the average of those of the SJ cells (0.65 ± 0.02). The JSC (4.9 ± 0.3 mA cm−2) demonstrates the minimal loss of photocurrent, consistent with the complementary absorption of the subcells. The highest ηP of SC1 and SC2 are 2.8 ± 0.1% and 4.0 ± 0.1%, respectively, and the highest ηP of the MJ cell is 5.5 ± 0.2%.

Solid curves are taken under 1 sun illumination (AM1.5G), and dashed curves are taken in dark. Shown SJ1 and SJ2 were fabricated in parallel with the subcells of shown MJ. (b) Wavelength-resolved external quantum efficiency of SC1 (red) and SC2 (blue) selected via optical bias (λ = 532 nm laser, 50 mW; and AM 1.5G simulation, 100 mW cm−2; respectively). 

Fig. 2b shows wavelength-resolved external quantum and efficiency (EQE) of a MJ cell with similar subcell thicknesses thicker RZ as the empirically optimized structure. The measured photocurrent is due to the photoresponse of the current-limiting subcell, thus a subcell can be selected for EQE measurement via properly chosen optical bias. SC1 (red) and SC2 (blue) were selected via optical bias of λ = 532 nm laser, 50 mW; and simulated AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2; respectively; such that the selected subcell generates a photocurrent within an order of magnitude of the measured JSC under 1 sun and the deselected subcell generates a significantly larger photocurrent. With application of the optical model described above, we calculate that under λ = 532 nm laser illumination SC2 generates 412% more photocharges than SC1 and under simulated AM1.5G illumination SC1 generates 28% more photocharges than SC2. Through varying optical bias intensity and spectra, we find that this level of photocharge generation unbalance is sufficient to clearly select SC2 for EQE measurement (data not shown). The EQE spectrum of SC1 corresponds to the optical absorption spectrum of ClAlPc thin film (over the spectral range λ = 600 nm–850 nm) with a small response corresponding to C60 film (λ < 500 nm), and the EQE spectrum of SC2 corresponds to a summation of the optical absorption spectrums of C60 (λ < 500 nm) and DBP (λ = 500 nm–650 nm).

Fig. 3 shows the dependence of MJ cell performance on the recombination zone (RZ) composition and layer thicknesses. Fig. 3a compares the J–V characteristics under 1 sun of MJ cells with either no RZ (i.e. SC1 in direct contact with SC2) or RZ compositions of: Ag 0.5 nm, BCP 5 nm/MoOx 5 nm, or BCP 5 nm/Ag 0.5 nm/MoOx 5 nm. Comparing the MJ cell with no RZ and the MJ cell with the full RZ, the FF increases by 40% (from 0.40 ± 0.002 to 0.56 ± 0.002) and the ηP increases by 160% (from 1.9 ± 0.2% to 5.0 ± 0.2%). In Fig. 3b, the thickness of each layer of the RZ was varied while keeping all other layers constant. Solid circles correspond to BCP x nm/Ag 0.5 nm/MoOx 5 nm, open circles correspond to BCP 5 nm/Ag 0.5 nm/MoOx x nm, and squares correspond to BCP 5 nm/Ag x nm/MoOx 5 nm. By increasing the BCP and MoOx thicknesses from 5 nm to 7.5 nm and 5 nm to 10 nm, respectively, the FF decreases by 5% and 11%, respectively. By increasing the Ag thickness, the JSC decreases by 22%. Other photovoltaic parameters were negligibly affected (as shown in Fig. S3, ESI†).

Fig. 4a shows the calculated optical field distribution within the empirically-optimized MJ cell for two wavelengths (λ = 530 nm, absorbed primarily by DBP, and λ = 785 nm, absorbed only by ClAlPc). The optical interference due to the reflective top electrode and the nanoscale-thickness of the MJ cell is evident. The optical intensity of λ = 785 nm light (which is primarily absorbed by the ClAlPc film) peaks farther from the reflective electrode than λ = 530 nm light (which is primarily absorbed by the DBP film), matching the placement of the ClAlPc- and DBP-containing subcells. By numerically varying the four free variables: one for each of the donor and acceptor film thicknesses in the MJ cell, we find the modeled-maximum-JSC for MJ structure with SC1: ClAlPc 9.5 nm/ClAlPc:C60 6 nm/C60 8 nm and SC2: DBP 25 nm/C60 29 nm, which closely matches the empirically optimized structure, SC1: ClAlPc 11.4 nm/ClAlPc:C60 7.2 nm/C60 9.6 nm and SC2: DBP 20 nm/C60 23.2 nm. Fig. 4b shows the calculated JSC for an array of SC1 and SC2 total thicknesses varying from 19 nm to 28 nm and from 43 nm to 65 nm, respectively, and with donor:acceptor thickness ratios restrained to those of the modeled-maximum-JSC MJ cell. The overlaid text is the empirical data of MJ cells fabricated with the designated pair of subcell thicknesses. Over this range, the simulated JSC are within error of the experimental JSC. Additionally, the trend of the simulated JSC closely follows that of the experimental JSC, confirming the model's validity when used for optical optimization.

Overlaid is text of experimental JSC for nine samples corresponding to the thicknesses designated by their position. Experimental JSC error is ±0.2 mA cm−2 and thickness error is ±1 nm. 

Fig. 5 shows the responsivity (R = JSC/Io) of the MJ cell and its component subcells in the SJ architecture measured under illumination intensities (Io) in the range of 0.05 ± 0.005 mW cm−2 to 100 ± 10 mW cm−2. The R of the subcells is linear, however the R of SJ2 has a steeper slope and a plateau above 40 mW cm−2. R of the MJ cell follows the R of SJ2. The photovoltaic parameters of the MJ cell versus Io are shown in Fig. 5b. Each increases monotonically with increasing illumination intensity, with an FF reaching a maximum value of 0.685 ± 0.002 at 13 mW cm−2 and an ηP reaching a plateau above 40 mW cm−2 at 5.5 ± 0.8%.

Discussion
Comparison of the SJ and MJ cell current density–voltage characteristics demonstrates effective opto-electrical optimization of the MJ cell structure. The MJ cell ηP is 5.5 ± 0.2%, a nearly 40% improvement over the most efficient SJ cell made with these materials (labeled “SJ2 (optimal)” in Table 1). The minimal loss of VOC from the two subcells confirms the efficient operation of the RZ. The similarity of the JSC of the SJ cell and MJ cell as well as the spectral response of the MJ subcells shown in Fig. 2b demonstrate the complementary absorption of the subcells and the broad utilization of the solar spectrum from λ = 350 nm to λ = 850 nm. Integrating the EQE spectra of each subcell with the AM1.5G spectrum gives a generated JSC for SC1 of 3.6 ± 0.4 mA cm−2 and for SC2 of 3.2 ± 0.3 mA cm−2, as compared to the measured MJ cell JSC of 3.9 ± 0.2 mA cm−2. Both integrated subcell JSC are low by 10–20%, possibly due to spectral aberration of the calibration spectrum and/or of the solar simulated illumination. It is expected that if each subcell peak EQE was increased from the present 25 ± 5% to 70%, a practical limit already achieved in the best OPVs,2 then the JSC and ηP would be additionally enhanced up to three-fold, suggesting a practically-achievable potential ηP of >10% with these organic materials and the MJ device architecture.

A key component in advancing from fabrication of single junction cells to multijunction cells is the selection and deposition of an efficient recombination zone. MJ cells fabricated without any recombination zone or with just BCP/MoOx or just Ag nanoclusters exhibit S-shaped current density characteristics, suggesting a build-up of space–charge14 due to inefficient recombination of subcell currents of opposing charge. However the complete 3-layer RZ (BCP/Ag/MoOx) has clear rectification, resulting in high FF and VOC. The RZ can be further optimized by tuning each layer thickness. For BCP and MoOx film thicknesses >5 nm, the FF is sub-optimal. Since BCP and MoOx are semiconducting thin films, the series resistance of the cell increases with the thickness of either layer, consequently decreasing FF while maintaining a high VOC. Furthermore, JSC decreases with increasing Ag thickness. This is due to the non-negligible absorption of Ag nanoclusters, decreasing the optical intensity in the subcells.15 Due to these effects, the optimized RZ is BCP 2.5 nm/Ag 0.5 nm/MoOx 2.5 nm and is used in devices throughout this work unless otherwise indicated.
For series-connected MJ cells, an equal current density must flow through both of the subcells, which leads to a dependence of the overall photovoltaic performance on the relative photocurrent generated in each subcell. Therefore the photocurrent generation of each subcell was modelled for a range of subcell donor:acceptor thickness ratios and total thicknesses. Due to optical interference, the optical intensity of NIR light peaks farther from the reflective electrode than visible wavelengths, thus the NIR-absorbing subcell (SC1) is placed further from the reflective electrode than the visible-absorbing subcell (SC2). This is in contrast to tandem stacking of typical inorganic or organic solar cells where the largest bandgap sub-cell must be positioned closest to the incident light1,13 for best MJ performance. The structured absorption spectrum of our NIR cell (SC1) which has minimal absorption of visible light, enables us to place the SC1 in front of SC2 and optimize our MJ design for the peaks in the optical fields of different colors of light.
Fabricated devices with subcell thicknesses either 20% thicker or thinner than those of the maximum-JSC structure (the plot range shown in Fig. 4b) exhibit short-circuit currents within 15 ± 5% of the maximum JSC (5.5 ± 0.4 mA cm−2), open-circuit voltages within 5 ± 0.6% of the maximum VOC (1.65 ± 0.01 V) and fill factors within 20 ± 0.3% of the maximum FF (0.685 ± 0.002). Thus FF is also a key factor in optimizing subcell thicknesses to maximize the ηP of the MJ cell. Over the same thickness range the FF of SC1 and SC2 in the SJ architecture vary by only 3 ± 1% and 5 ± 3%, respectively, thus the MJ cell FF thickness dependence is due predominately to the dependence of FF on photocurrent matching.16,17 Therefore, where the generated photocurrent of each subcell is equal, as in the maximal-JSC MJ cell (SC1 and SC2 thicknesses of 23 ± 2 nm and 54 ± 2 nm, respectively), the MJ cell FF (0.604 ± 0.002) is within 5% of the average of the subcell FFs (0.639 ± 0.02). However, in MJ cells with thinner SC1 and/or thicker SC2, the FF is significantly lower than the average of the subcell FFs (e.g. 0.548 ± 0.002 vs. 0.633 ± 0.002 for total SC1 and SC2 thicknesses of 23 ± 2 nm and 65 ± 2 nm, respectively). The subcell thickness has a minimal effect on VOC because with the optimized hybrid tunnel junction RZ the VOC is equivalent to the sum of the SJ cells, and the VOC of the SJ cells are essentially independent of subcell thickness.
The responsivities of the subcells are linear with illumination intensity from 0.1 to 100 mW cm−2, suggesting that their quantum efficiency is limited by geminate pair recombination.18 Further, for this subcell thickness, the MJ cell responsivity follows the shape of SC2, suggesting it is limited by the photoresponse of SC2 except at low intensities (<0.01 sun). This further confirms the EQE measurements and optical modelling that identify SC2 as the current-limiting subcell in this MJ structure.
Conclusions
In conclusion, we demonstrated a multijunction cell with ηP of 5.5 ± 0.2% by incorporating near-infrared-absorbing visibly-transparent ClAlPc and visible-absorbing DBP, with all layers fabricated via vapor deposition. These devices are enabled by an efficient hybrid tunnel junction RZ and optimized optically for maximum photocurrent generation. The MJ cells shown here are ultimately limited by the low EQEs of the component subcells (of between 20% and 30%), thus further enhancement of subcell EQE to practical limits2 (e.g. EQE between 70% and 80%) could lead to OPVs with ηP of >10%. Multijunction architectures are an important approach to reduce thermal losses and improve overall efficiencies of PVs composed of nanostructured and organic materials and will likely be important to their commercial viability.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  (a) Absorption spectra of C60 (green), DBP (blue) and ClAlPc (red) thin films, showing broad spectral response. Molecular structures are in the inset. (b) Energy levels of each component layer of the multijunction cells. (c) Device cross-section of the multijunction cells. Thicknesses not to scale.	 

 	Fig. 2  (a) Representative current density–voltage characteristics of MJ (green), SJ1 (red) and SJ2 (blue). Solid curves are taken under 1 sun illumination (AM1.5G), and dashed curves are taken in dark. Shown SJ1 and SJ2 were fabricated in parallel with the subcells of shown MJ. (b) Wavelength-resolved external quantum efficiency of SC1 (red) and SC2 (blue) selected via optical bias (λ = 532 nm laser, 50 mW; and AM 1.5G simulation, 100 mW cm−2; respectively).	 

 	Fig. 3  (a) Current density–voltage characteristics of MJ cells with either no RZ (dash-dotted) or RZ of: Ag 0.5 nm (short dash), BCP 5 nm/MoOx 5 nm (long dash), BCP 5 nm/Ag 0.5 nm/MoOx 5 nm (solid). (b) Fill factor of MJ cells with BCP x nm/Ag 0.5 nm/MoOx 5 nm (solid circles) or BCP 5 nm/Ag 0.5 nm/MoOx x nm (open circles) as the RZ. And short-circuit current of MJ cells with BCP 5 nm/Ag x nm/MoOx 5 nm (squares) as the RZ. Measurements were performed under 100 mW cm−2, AM1.5G.	 

 	Fig. 4  (a) Optical fields for wavelengths absorbed by SC1 (λ = 785 nm) and SC2 (λ = 530 nm) within the optimal MJ cell modeled via T-matrix formalism. (b) Simulated short-circuit currents for an array of thicknesses of subcells 1 and 2 with fixed donor–acceptor ratios. Overlaid is text of experimental JSC for nine samples corresponding to the thicknesses designated by their position. Experimental JSC error is ±0.2 mA cm−2 and thickness error is ±1 nm.	 

 	Fig. 5  (a) Responsivity of MJ (green), SJ1 (red) and SJ2 (blue) cells to solar simulation of varying intensities. Shown SJ1 and SJ2 were fabricated in parallel with the subcells of shown MJ. (b) Photovoltaic performance parameters (ηP, VOC, and FF) of MJ cell under varying intensities of solar simulation.
