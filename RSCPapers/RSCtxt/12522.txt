    , Accepted 7th February 2023First published on 8th February 2023AbstractWith the application of new materials and the optimization of device structure, binary bulk heterojunction organic solar cells (OSCs) have exhibited the outstanding performance in recent years. However, the open-circuit voltage (Voc) of binary OSCs is normally below 1 V and the matched energy levels of the donor, acceptor and transport materials with high Voc in binary OSCs have been rarely proposed. Herein, four different machine learning (ML) algorithms are applied to investigate Voc in binary OSCs according to the energy level of donor, acceptor and transport materials. Among them, the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model provides the best prediction ability. Its prediction accuracy and root mean square error reach 0.94 and 0.04, respectively. Therefore, SHapley Additive exPlanations of XGBoost is selected and showed that the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the donor plays the most important role for the improvement of Voc in all the energy level of donor, acceptor and transport materials. More importantly the energy level matching strategy of binary OSC materials for high Voc is delivered by machine learning, where the HOMO of the donor is about −5.45 ± 0.1 eV, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the acceptor is about −3.80 ± 0.1 eV, and the work functions of the matched electron and hole transport materials are about −3.6 ± 0.2 eV and −5.1 ± 0.1 eV, respectively. In addition, the experimental verification results display that the measured Voc just has a relatively low error compared with the predicted Voc. Likewise, the predicted Voc based on the XGBoost model of PTB7:PC71BM is 0.79 V, and the experimental value is 0.76 V. The relative error is only 3.95%, which indicates the reliability of the ML prediction for high Voc in binary OSCs.

Design, System, Application
Fabricating high performance organic solar cells (OSCs) with high open-circuit voltage (Voc) usually requires a large amount of time and cost. Here, we use the machine learning (ML) algorithms to establish the prediction model between the materials of OSCs and Vocvia the energy level. These models have high prediction accuracy, where the accuracy and the root mean square error of the Voc are 0.94 and 0.04, respectively. More importantly the matched energy level of binary OSC materials for high Voc is delivered by machine learning, where the HOMO of the donor is about −5.45 ± 0.1 eV, the LUMO of the acceptor is about −3.80 ± 0.1 eV, and the matched work functions of the electron and hole transport materials are about −3.6 ± 0.2 eV and −5.1 ± 0.1 eV, respectively. Moreover, a smaller prediction error has been obtained by experimental verification. Therefore the materials' energy level matching strategy from ML in this report can become a potential guide for designing new donor, acceptor and transport materials in binary OSCs with high Voc.

1. Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have received extensive attention in recent years due to their unique advantages of low cost, light weight, large-area fabrication, and flexible devices.1–4 At present, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of binary OSCs is over 18%,5 and the PCE of ternary OSCs can reach around 20%,6 which are gradually approaching the commercial standard. However the open-circuit voltage (Voc) of OSCs is much smaller than that of perovskite or GaAs solar cells. And the low Voc in OSCs is a significant limitation for further improving the PCE of OSCs. The Voc in OSCs is typically less than half of the optical bandgaps of the photovoltaic materials and is difficult to break through 1.0 V. In this report, we collect a dataset constructed for 400 groups data from 106 literatures reported since 2015, and the Gaussian distribution of Voc in binary OSCs is shown in Fig. 1. It is clear that the average value of Voc is 0.795 V, the median value is 0.80 V, and the standard deviation is 0.10 in binary OSCs. All of these reveal that the Voc of binary OSCs is concentrated around 0.80 V. The statistical results in Fig. 1 also show that the Voc of most binary OSCs is maintained in the range from 0.70 to 0.90 V, while the proportion of over 0.90 V for Voc is just only 14.25%, therefore the energy level matching strategy of binary OSCs with greater than 0.90 V or even more than 1.0 V of Voc has become a critical factor in further improving the performance of OSCs.
 Fig. 1  The Gaussian distribution of Voc in binary OSCs by 400 data in this dataset. 
In order to obtain a high Voc in binary OSCs, some factors have been investigated, such as energy level matching and energy loss in the donor (D) and acceptor (A), interfacial contact of D and A, morphology regulation, charge transfer state, carrier density and molecular packing behavior in the active layer, temperature and light intensity of the device,7–12 as shown in Fig. 2. Most studies reported that Voc can be effectively improved by regulating the energy level arrangement of D and A to promote the efficient charge transfer at the interface of D/A.13–15 At the same time, some studies also show that the interface modification methods, including adjusting the work functions of the hole/electron transport layer, can also effectively optimize the Voc in OSCs.16–18 However, the relationship between numerous influencing factors and Voc is still unknown. Therefore, a mathematically oriented learning model becomes an urgent need for constructing a simulation algorithm to further understand the dominant influencing factors of Voc. Furthermore, the data analysis and quantification capabilities of machine learning (ML) methods are well known.19 It can be a good choice to construct a model for quantifying the relationship between the energy level of donor, acceptor and transport materials and photovoltaic parameters.

ML allows researchers to discover the hidden complex relationships from data and can effectively reduce experimental errors and optimize the experimental procedure for achieving the desired results. What's more, ML methods have rapidly become the ideal tools for predicting photovoltaic performance over recent years. For examples, Wangnan Li's group used Random Forest (RF) and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithms to predict five kinds of undetected low-bandgap perovskites and successfully fabricated perovskite photovoltaic devices with the PCE of 22.5%.20 Wenbo Sun et al. selected 10 new types of donors from 1719 donors for OSCs via multiple ML-algorithm, and verified the reliability of the ML algorithm through experiments.21 Our group also applied ML to predict the champion PCE of ternary OSCs with the best doping ratio of the third material in our previous work.22 All these studies indicate that ML has high application value in the research of OSCs.23–25
In this work, the ML method is used to analyse the effects of the energy levels of the donor and acceptor and the work function of transport layers on the Voc in binary OSCs. As shown in Fig. 3, this work follows the basic process, which mainly includes the dataset establishment, model selection, feature extraction, model evaluation and interpretation, and experimental verification. And more details are shown in the ESI.† We apply the K-nearest neighbor (KNN), support vector regression (SVR), RF and XGBoost model to verify the correlation between the energy level of materials and Voc, and predict the Voc in binary OSCs. In addition, the guiding principles of the energy level in D and A and work function in transport materials for improving Voc are proposed. Finally, experimental verification is performed to check the prediction accuracy. And the detail of decomposition for the Voc can be interpreted by SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP).

2. Results and discussion
To investigate the relationship between Voc and the energy level of materials, the Pearson correlation coefficient (r) is applied to measure the degree of the linear correlation between the input feature and output. And the detail about the Pearson correlation coefficient calculation is displayed in the ESI.† The direction and strength of the linear relationship between variables can be directly reflected by the r value. Fig. 4(a) shows the Pearson correlation coefficient matrix between various electronic features (all energy levels of the active layer and transport layer) and Voc. It is worth noting that the HOMOs of D and A are significantly linearly correlated with Voc (rHOMO(D) = −0.53, rHOMO(A) = 0.59), which means that the influence of the HOMO of D and A should be taken into more consideration in binary OSCs with high Voc. A relatively lower-lying HOMO(D) or higher-lying HOMO(A) is beneficial to reduce the energy loss of the charge transfer state to obtain higher Voc.26,27 In addition, the correlation coefficient matrix between all material parameters and Jsc or PCE is shown in Fig. S1(a and b).† The HOMO(A) is linearly correlated with Jsc, indicating that a higher-lying HOMO(A) can achieve the narrow band gap of A to improve the Jsc. This may suggest that the increased HOMO of A could be considered in the new molecule synthesis for the enhancement of both the Jsc and Voc in OSCs. Moreover, Fig. 4(b) further shows the Pearson correlation coefficient matrix for Voc with the energy level offset between the donor's HOMO and the acceptor's LUMO (|HOMO(D)–LUMO(A)|), the HOMO energy offset between D and A (HOMO(I)), and the LUMO energy offset between D and A (LUMO(I)). Among them, the |HOMO(D)–LUMO(A)| is related to the HOMO(D) and LUMO(A), and the Pearson correlation coefficients are −0.53 and 0.075, respectively. When using two additional features that are not highly correlated as a new input feature can make the ML process more accurate.28 It is not difficult to find that the |HOMO(D)–LUMO(A)| appears to show a linear correlation with Voc in binary OSCs (r|HOMO(D)–LUMO(A)| = 0.44), which reveals that binary OSCs with fullerene or non-fullerene follows the linear dependence on the HOMO(D) and LUMO(A). Compared with the LUMO(I), the HOMO(I) has a greater correlation with Voc in the matrix relationship (rHOMO(I) = −0.66, rLUMO(I) = −0.14), indicating that the different HOMOs between D and A play a significant role in promoting the charge separation to increase the Voc in binary OSCs. This may originate from two reasons. One is that a larger Voc can often be obtained by designing the deeper-lying HOMO of D, meanwhile, the higher-lying HOMO of A is conducive to the construction of an acceptor with the narrow bandgap and the reduction of the energy barrier for charge transfer.29,30 The other is that the formation of an ohmic contact causes the effective charge transport from D to promote effective charge collection, which synergistically affects the Voc.31 Meanwhile, the relatively low correlation (rWFs-HTL = 0.014, rWFs-ETL = 0.083) reveals that the work function of the transport material has a small effect on Voc. When the work function of the transport materials does not match the HOMO(D) or LUMO(A), which will result in the formation of barriers at the contact interface and does not form the ohmic contact between the active layer and electrode, the Voc is limited.32,33 When the well-constructed ohmic contact is formed between transport materials and D and A, the transport materials must well match the LUMO of the A and the HOMO of the D, respectively, which can regulate the Voc in OSCs.32,34,35 The appropriate transport materials should be able to provide an arrangement of energy level matching for the active material to form a good ohmic contact and ensure satisfactory charge collection.36,37

In order to verify the model accuracy of prediction for Voc, we use six input variable values to train and predict the results on 400 data of Voc in OSCs. And multiple regression models are established to train and learn the datasets. The performance of four algorithmic models with the root mean square error (RMSE), the mean absolute error (MAE), and the coefficient of determination (R2) is calculated in the ESI† and displayed in Table 1. Among them, R2 analysis is carried out to measure the goodness of fitting from the ML model, the R2 value approaches 1 in the ideal case, and the RMSE and MAE are used as estimators to represent the deviation between the measured Voc and the predicted Voc. In KNN and SVR models, lower R2 values (RKNNtest2 = 0.64, RSVRtest2 = 0.60) and higher errors (RMSEKNNtest = 0.07, RMSESVRtest = 0.07) are obtained. Using the RF model, R2 of the test set is 0.82, and R2 of the cross-validation average was 0.79. Meanwhile, it has a lower RMSE, which is 0.05 and the MAE is 0.03. The prediction accuracy of RF can reach 0.90. More importantly the XGBoost model also shows the best evaluation performance. R2 of the test set is 0.87, and R2 of the cross-validation average is 0.86 in XGBoost. And a lower RMSE and MAE are obtained, which are 0.04 and 0.02, respectively. The prediction accuracy reaches 0.94, which means that the best predictive accuracy in the four model is XGBoost. What's more, Fig. 5(a–d) respectively show the regression relationship between the predicted and tested Voc based on the four ML models. It is clear that the prediction results of RF and XGBoost models are in good agreement with the experimental data, showing a linear regression state. And XGBoost can provide more accurate prediction capabilities for Voc than RF. It worth mentioning that all performances are obtained by randomly shuffling all data points and repeating the experimental process. The randomness can ensure the lower correlation among individual trees and thereby reduces the risk of bias. All in all, the XGBoost model is selected among the four used ML algorithms for the following study. The regression relationship between the predicted and tested Jsc or the PCE based on the XGBoost model is shown in Fig. S1(c and d).†

To analyze the importance of input features for Voc, the SHAP method based on the XGBoost model is used to analyze and identify the important features for driving the prediction model. SHAP provides a means of quantifying the feature importance, and shows the contribution degree of each influence feature for Voc. The input feature importance analysis is shown in Fig. 6(a), and the importance of the HOMO(D) feature is the top one in all the input features affecting Voc, which is very important for the model to predict Voc. What's more, the input feature density distribution of SHAP values based on the XGBoost model is shown in Fig. 6(b), and the relative importance of the energy level is listed on the Y-axis and ranked according to the sum of SHAP values in Fig. 6(a). The SHAP value of the blue points with low characteristics for the HOMO(D) is greater than 0, revealing that the deeper-lying HOMO(D) can increase the Voc of OSCs. Meanwhile, SHAP values also show that the HOMO(A) with high characteristics (red points) and the LUMO(A) with high characteristics (red points) are proportional to the Voc. The high LUMO(A) allows the rapid electron transfer from D, and the elevated HOMO(A) is conducive for achieving the narrow optical bandgap for broadening the absorption spectrum of A, which can offer effective charge transport.38 Previous studies have also demonstrated that Voc can be effectively enhanced by designing D with deeper-lying HOMO levels or A with higher-lying LUMO levels,39 which is consistent with the analysis results of our prediction model. For the work function of the hole transport layer (WF-HTL) and work function of the electron transport layer (WF-ETL), most points are concentrated at the SHAP value of 0, which means that these two features are not important factors for Voc.

Correlation between the predicted and measured Voc using XGBoost (c) based on two relatively important features the HOMO(D) and LUMO(A), (d) based on two non-important features the WF-HTL and WF-ETL, and (e) based on four features the HOMO(D), LUMO(A), WF-HTL and WF-ETL. 
For emphasizing the regression relationship between the important features and Voc, the HOMO(D) and LUMO(A) are selected to predict and analyze Voc based on the XGBoost model. As shown in Fig. 6(c–e), the highest R2 values of the training and testing sets were 0.77 and 0.58 respectively, and the corresponding RMSE values were 0.05 and 0.07 respectively, which indicates that the prediction of Voc is appropriate and feasible based on the XGBoost model when only using two relatively important features (HOMO(D) and LUMO(A)). When only two features the WF-HTL and WF-ETL are used as the input parameters, the highest R2 values of the training set and testing set are 0.87 and 0.20 respectively, and the corresponding RMSE values are 0.04 and 0.10 respectively, which indicates that although the XGBoost model can better learn training parameters, it obviously does not have the ability to fit more accurate prediction results, because the importance scores of these two features are low. When we apply the four features the HOMO(D), LUMO(A), WF-HTL and WF-ETL to predict Voc, the predictive ability is about equal to the sum of the two types of correlation models between the predicted and measured Voc, which means that the accuracy of model prediction needs to be supported by more influencing factors and relatively important input features play an important role. At the same time, the functional relationship between two important features (HOMO(D) and LUMO(A)), two non-important features (WF-HTL and WF-ETL) and Voc can be visually expressed through scattering interval, as displayed in Fig. S2(a and b).† The scattering distribution of high Voc (0.90 V) is concentrated. In particular, for the electron transport layer, it is still possible to obtain a high Voc at −2.8 eV for the WF-ETL, which comes from the low work function metals (such as Ca and Ba) that can receive both electrons and holes for effectively preventing exciton quenching at the electrode.40,41
In order to provide the useful energy level matching strategy for the high Voc in binary OSCs, the contour plots for the Voc as a function of the HOMO(D) and LUMO(A) are shown in Fig. 7(a). It is easy to see the Voc change in the range of 0.6 V–1.0 V, which can be appropriately regulated by the HOMO(D) and LUMO(A) energy levels. This suggests that adjusting the HOMO(D) and LUMO(A) arrangement can modify the Voc. Fig. S3(a and b)† respectively show the contour plots for the Voc as a function of the HOMO(D) and WF-HTL and the Voc as a function of the LUMO(A) and WF-ETL. It can be found that the WF-ETL and WF-HTL do not cause a significant change in Voc and must make a combination with the appropriate HOMO(D) or LUMO(A) to effectively adjust the Voc, which indicates that the work function of the matched electron/hole transport materials is only one of the auxiliary factors for changing the Voc. Based on the prediction results of the above ML model, and combined with the functional relationship between Voc and electronic features in Fig. S2† and 6, we further construct the optimized energy level matching strategy of the involved material parameters for improving the Voc as shown in Fig. 7(b). According to the prediction results, the Voc of the binary OSCs can exceed 1.0 V, and the high Voc value corresponds to the HOMO(D) with about −5.45 ± 0.1 eV, LUMO(A) with about −3.80 ± 0.1 eV, WF-ETL with about −3.6 ± 0.2 eV and WF-HTL with −5.1 ± 0.1 eV, respectively. Obviously, the work functions of the transport material do not determine the high Voc. For example, based on PTQ10:IDIC binary OSCs had the high Voc. The HOMO of PTQ10 is −5.54 eV and LUMO of IDIC is −3.91 eV. The PEDOT:PSS (WF = −5.11 eV), PDINO (WF = −3.64 eV), PEDOT:PSS-GO (WF = −5.00 eV), and PDINO-G (WF = −3.86 eV) were used as transport layers, respectively. The PCE of the corresponding cells with PEDOT:PSS and PDINO is 11.56% and the PCE of the device with PEDOT:PSS-GO and PDINO-G is 12.44%, but the Voc of the two kinds of devices are both 0.96 V.42 This is in good agreement with the optimal energy level matching strategy given by ML. Meanwhile, these experimental results once again verify that the energy level shift between D and A determines the regulation of Voc. Tuning the work function of the transport materials can stabilize the electron and hole transfer, maybe can optimize the device performance, but cannot effectively determine the value of Voc.

3. Experimental verification
In order to evaluate the prediction results of the XGBoost model on different unknown data, we prepared five types of devices with different active layers, including PTB7:PC71BM, PTB7-Th:PC71BM, PffBT4T-2OD:PC71BM, PM6:Y6, and PM6:ITIC-M to verify the prediction. The fabricated device structure and the energy level of the materials are shown in Fig. S4.† And it is noted that all energy levels of the materials in OSCs for the prediction were obtained in the literature and are shown in Table S2.† For the sake of discussion, we named the different devices to compare their performance. Under 100 mW cm−2 and 1.5G AM conditions, the J–V characteristic curve and photovoltaic parameters are shown in Fig. 8(a and b) and Table 2. It is not difficult to find that the reported Voc values in Table S3† from other research groups and the measured Voc values in Table 2 are comparable. Therefore, the measured results can provide a reliable reference for verifying ML predictions. The Voc of Device3 (PffBT4T-2OD:PC71BM) is 0.80 V, Jsc is 16.78 mA cm−2, FF is 66.42%, and PCE is 8.92%. From Device1 to Device3, it is not difficult to find that the Voc gradually increases from 0.76 V to 0.80 V, which results from the deeper-lying HOMO energy level of the donor (−5.15 eV for PTB7, −5.24 eV for PTB7-Th, and −5.34 eV for PffBT4T-2OD) to reduce the energy offset between D and A, which means that the energy loss can be reduced for enhancing Voc in OSCs.43,44 The predicted Voc based on the XGBoost model of the PTB7:PC71BM device is 0.79 V, which is in good agreement with the experimental value. Meanwhile, the small relative error indicates that the XGBoost model can be extended to predict the performance of OSCs. Two sets of non-fullerene devices are based on PM6 as the donor, where the Voc of Device5 (PM6:ITIC-M) is 1.01 V, which is much higher than the Voc of Device4 (PM6:Y6) which is 0.84 V. However, the Jsc is only 13.3 mA cm−2, resulting in a significantly lower PCE. This is attributed to ITIC-M end-group modification affecting absorption, and the OSCs with ITIC-M exhibit a relatively low Jsc and FF.45 The increase of Voc in the OSCs with ITIC-M can be due to the non-fullerene molecular end-groups, which act as electron-withdrawing units, intensifying intramolecular charge transfer, lead to the efficient charge transfer and extraction and regulate the energy level. In particular the LUMO energy level of D and A is matched (the LUMO of Y6 is −4.10 eV and the LUMO of ITIC-M is −3.98 eV).46,47

Furthermore, for exploring the effect of the work function of the transport layer on Voc, we designed PEDOT:PSS (Device1) and MoOx (Device6) as the HTL for the normal device and ZnO (Device7) as the ETL for the inverted device to verify the prediction results. Compared with Device1, the Voc of Device6 is 0.73 V, and the decrease of Voc can be attributed to the smaller work function of MoOx and the formation of oxygen-containing carbon substances between MoOx and the PTB7 donor, which destroys the original stable structure in the active layer.48 PEDOT:PSS as the HTL in OSCs can help the active layer capture photons more effectively under the same conditions. In Fig. S5(a and b),† in the absorption range of the PTB7:PC71BM film from 300 to 400 nm, the absorption intensity of the PTB7:PC71BM film with PEDOT:PSS is significantly increased compared with that with MoOx, and the transmission intensity also keeps the same trend with the absorption, which explains one of the reasons for the lower Jsc on devices with MoOx. The Voc of devices with the inverted structure is different from that with the normal structure, which may be due to multiple factors such as the charge trap of the ZnO film, and the interface state between the active layer and ZnO layer.17,49,50 In addition, it is worth mentioning that we focused on Voc of OSCs in this work, we did not further optimize the device PCE. More importantly the relative error between the reported Voc and the predicted Voc in Table S3† is similar to the relative error between the measured Voc and the predicted Voc in Table 2, which also reveals that the prediction of Voc from the ML model has certain reliability.
Moreover, based on the advantages in the visualization of the relationship between the energy level of materials and Voc on the XGBoost model as well as identification of important features driving prediction, we take the OSCs with the PTB7:PC71BM and PM6:Y6 classical blend system as the important examples for the visual prediction, as shown in Fig. 8(c and d). The predicted base value of Voc in Device1 based on PTB7:PC71BM is 0.7987, and the final output value of Voc is 0.79 V. The predicted base value of Voc for Device4 based on PM6:Y6 is 0.7969, and the final output value of Voc is 0.90 V. In Fig. 8(c and d), the red part represents the increase of Voc and the blue part stands for the decrease of Voc. PM6 has a deeper-lying HOMO(D) than PTB7, while Y6 has a smaller band gap than PC71BM. All contributions promote high Voc. The final output of Voc is obtained when the prediction model accounts for the effects of all input features. All prediction results can provide certain optimization ideas for experimental design. Moreover, compared with the predicted results, obviously the experimental results are slightly different. This difference may be related to experimental conditions, material batches, device structures, measuring equipment and other factors.
4. Conclusion
In summary, we use ML methods to analyze the complex relationship between Voc and energy level of the donor, acceptor and transport materials in binary OSCs, and quantitatively label and explain the primary and secondary influencing factors for Voc of binary OSCs in all input features. The results of the prediction model show that the tree-based algorithm models (RF and XGBoost models) achieve relatively good learning ability, and their prediction accuracy can reach more than 90%. What's more, the matched energy level arrangement of materials for binary OSCs with high Voc is given, where the HOMO(D) and the LUMO(A) are about −5.45 ± 0.1 eV and −3.80 ± 0.1 eV respectively, and the WF-ETL and WF-HTL are about −3.6 ± 0.2 eV and −5.1 ± 0.1 eV respectively. And the relationship between Voc and the energy level of materials is revealed, where the binary OSCs with fullerene or non-fullerene follow the linear dependence on the HOMO(D) and LUMO(A). Finally, the SHAP of the XGBoost model finds out that the top feature HOMO(D) can control Voc and makes reasonable predictions for the experimental devices. From experimental verification, the small relative error from 2.50% to 7.14% between the predicted Voc and the measured Voc verified that the ML model has certain reliability and analytical power. Therefore, these results can provide the corresponding guidance of ML for the preparation of OSCs with high Voc: (1) the optimal range of material energy level design, (2) the visual relationship between the electronic characteristics of materials and OSCs' performance, and (3) the potential interaction between energy level features in OSCs.

Design, System, Application
Fabricating high performance organic solar cells (OSCs) with high open-circuit voltage (Voc) usually requires a large amount of time and cost. Here, we use the machine learning (ML) algorithms to establish the prediction model between the materials of OSCs and Vocvia the energy level. These models have high prediction accuracy, where the accuracy and the root mean square error of the Voc are 0.94 and 0.04, respectively. More importantly the matched energy level of binary OSC materials for high Voc is delivered by machine learning, where the HOMO of the donor is about −5.45 ± 0.1 eV, the LUMO of the acceptor is about −3.80 ± 0.1 eV, and the matched work functions of the electron and hole transport materials are about −3.6 ± 0.2 eV and −5.1 ± 0.1 eV, respectively. Moreover, a smaller prediction error has been obtained by experimental verification. Therefore the materials' energy level matching strategy from ML in this report can become a potential guide for designing new donor, acceptor and transport materials in binary OSCs with high Voc.
