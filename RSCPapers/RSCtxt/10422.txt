    , Accepted 4th November 2022First published on 7th November 2022AbstractIn recent years, the research and development of new white LEDs have attracted extensive attention. Whether the new LEDs have a higher color rendering index and can simulate natural sunlight without damaging human health is the issue of concern. Therefore, we introduce in detail the ultraviolet (UV) excited luminescence characteristics of Eu ions, Ce ions, and other ions in different host lattice (aluminate, silicate, phosphate, and borate) matrices. This paper summarizes the introduction and application of rare-earth ions as activation center phosphors and expounds on the application potential of cyan and blue phosphors in many fields such as display technology from the aspects of excitation and emission characteristics, lifetime, color purity, and thermal stability.

1. Introduction
Since the phenomenon of discharge luminescence was studied in phosphors in the early 19th century, phosphor research has been a hot spot in the world, among which rare-earth ion-doped phosphors have attracted the attention of countless scholars. Rare-earth ion-doped phosphors are used in displays, solar cells, light-emitting diodes, and LED lamps and in biomedicine because of their excellent photochemical stability, narrow emission band, and long luminous life. In recent years, the “green development model” has raised the requirements for LED lamps. Compared with incandescent lamps and fluorescent lamps, white light-emitting diodes (LEDs) have the characteristics of a long working time, energy-saving, high luminous efficiency, small size, and environmentally friendly. It has been widely used in many important fields.1–7 However, traditional LED lamps have a low color rendering index, harm due to blue light, and spectral structural defects, so we must find new materials to prepare full spectrum LED lamps. Although white LEDs can be prepared by adjusting the proportion of blue, green, and red fluorescent materials, due to the lack of high-quality cyan and blue emission phosphors, their luminous performance is limited. Using multiple phosphors in a single device increases cost and manufacturing complexity, and leads to other issues such as efficiency losses due to reabsorption. In addition, the thermal quenching behavior between different phosphors will also lead to obvious changes in the white light produced by LEDs. Therefore, it is very important to develop efficient blue and cyan phosphors.
1.1 Rare-earth ions
Rare-earth elements include 17 elements, and is the general name for 17 metal elements in the periodic table, including lanthanides, scandium, and yttrium. Due to their special electronic structure, the 4f orbit of rare-earth ions is located inside the ions and shielded by the external 5s2 and 5p6 orbits. Therefore, the compounds doped with rare-earth ions have different physical and chemical properties than other compounds, and the phosphors prepared using rare-earth ions also have excellent luminescence properties. For example, in terms of optical performance, they have high color purity, strong light absorption ability, and high conversion efficiency. In terms of stability, rare-earth luminescent materials are more resistant to high temperatures than ordinary materials, and they can withstand high-power electron beams, high-energy radiation, and strong ultraviolet radiation. Rare-earth ions have a very high research value. Countries all over the world are vigorously studying the application of rare-earth, but the distribution of rare-earth resources in the world is uneven. China's rare-earth resources account for about 40% of the world. Therefore, the research, development, and utilization of rare earth not only have extraordinary scientific significance but also bring great economic benefits to China.
1.2 Phosphor luminescence mechanism
Luminescence of materials refers to the light emission of non-thermal radiation. The internal electrons obtain energy through a transition from the ground state to the excited state, and then return to the ground state when the material is excited. The energy released during this period is not only used for thermal radiation but also used for luminescence. For the phosphors prepared by doping rare-earth elements, rare-earth ions act as luminescence centers to undergo electronic transitions to produce luminescence. The 4f and 5d energy levels of Ce3+and Eu2+ ions in the phosphor directly determine the excitation and emission characteristics of the phosphor, and its luminescence is also closely related to the internal interaction between the activator and the host. Therefore, when Eu2+and Ce3+undergo 4f–5d transitions in a suitable host material, cyan and blue emissions will occur. For other ions, as long as appropriate electronic transitions occur, cyan and blue emissions can be generated. For example, the 1S0 → 3P1 transition of Bi3+ can also generate cyan and blue emissions.
1.3 Application of phosphor
Phosphor for field emission display: the working principle of field emission display (FED) technology is similar to that of the CRT technology. The difference is that FED directly bombards the fluorescent screen with a large number of electron beams on the field emission cathode array to make the phosphor glow without the action of the deflection coil. In addition, FED does not need heat or energy when it is turned off and thus belongs to low-voltage cold cathode emission, while CRT belongs to high-voltage hot-electron beam emission (Fig. 1a).
 Fig. 1  (a) Schematic diagram of a FED display; (b) a typical modern plasma screen television. 
Plasma display and other display systems: plasma display (PDP) is a light-emitting flat panel display technology prepared by using the principle of gas discharge. Its light-emitting principle is to make the gas discharge emit vacuum ultraviolet light to excite the phosphor by applying a certain voltage to the inert gas. In addition, the application of phosphor in temperature sensing is also one of the important fields.8,9 As a non-contact temperature measurement method, compared with traditional temperature measurement methods, it has significant advantages of a wide response range, high accuracy and high sensitivity (Fig. 1b).
LED devices are an important part of phosphor applications. The factors affecting the quality of LED devices include phosphor luminous performance, LED chips, packaging technology, and so on. The phosphor used in LEDs should have good excitation in the near-ultraviolet (n-UV) region, high quantum efficiency (QE), low thermal quenching, good stability, simple synthesis conditions and production technology, and an easy to control particle morphology. WLED is not only superior to traditional incandescent lamps and fluorescent lamps in brightness and photoelectric conversion efficiency, but also more energy-saving and safer than them. In order to achieve full spectrum emission, first, the “cyan gap” must be filled, so the research and development of cyan phosphor is very necessary. Second, because GaN chips are expensive, quantum efficiency is low, and the preparation process is relatively complex, it is necessary to develop some blue phosphors with excellent performance. Therefore, this paper reviews the preparation and luminescent properties of cyan and blue phosphors. The stability and coordinated emission of phosphors can be improved by doping different ions, and the differences in the luminescent properties of phosphors prepared with different hosts are introduced.
2. Cyan phosphor system
2.1 Eu2+ as an excitation center
Xiaozhan Yang et al.10 synthesized ZnAl2O4 (BaxZn1−xAl2O4:Eu2+ phosphor) with an alkaline earth element Ba substitution component for the first time by the high-temperature solid-state reaction. The samples show polycrystalline morphology, and the grain size is between a few microns and ten microns. Phosphors exhibit blue-green emission, but alkaline earth aluminate luminescent materials generally have poor storage stability, and their chemical stability needs to be further improved (Fig. 2). Ishwar Prasad Sahu et al.11 prepared a Sr2Al2SiO7:Eu2+ phosphor, changed the coordination environment of Eu2+, obtained a cyan emission phosphor with good chemical stability and color stability, and also achieved mechanical luminescence (ML) intensity. Jing Li et al.12 prepared phosphors coated with phenolic epoxy resin (EOCN) of SrAl204:Eu2+,Dy3+ modified by an amino silane coupling agent (KH550) by an organic–inorganic composite impregnation method and a UV curing method.
 Fig. 2  (a) Photoluminescence spectra of BaxZn1−xAl2O4:Eu2+ phosphors; (b) CIE chromaticity coordinates of BaxZn1−xAl2O4:Eu2+ phosphors: (A) 30% Ba; (B) 40% Ba; (C) 50% Ba; (D) 60% Ba; (E) 70% Ba; (F) 80% Ba; (G) 90% Ba; and (H) 100% Ba. 
The EOCN/TSHF coating not only has little effect on the grain size but also greatly improves the fluidity, dispersion and chemical stability of the phosphor. It can also make the photoluminescence peak of the phosphor blue shift, resulting in cyan emission. Although phosphors based on aluminates can exhibit excellent cyan emission, measures need to be taken to improve their chemical stability to obtain luminescent materials with greater application potential.
Maria Wierzaa-wieczorek et al.13 reported the Ba2Gd2Si4O13 compound existing in the single crystal form for the first time. Zhou et al.14 and Gen Li et al.15 prepared some bivalent and trivalent rare-earth ion doped Ba2Gd2Si4O13 phosphors. The prepared phosphors had the property of long afterglow, but the continuous luminescence time was not long. B. R. Young et al.16 first proposed BaZrSi3O9 and found that it is a blue LPP (long-lasting phosphorescence) material. Yahong Jin et al.17 reported the LLP and TL (thermoluminescence) properties of BaZrSi3O9 phosphors doped with RE3+ ions (RE = Eu, Sm, Dy, Tb, and Pr) (Fig. 3). However, the luminescence performance of the BaZrSi3O9 phosphor doped with RE3+ ions is poor; its glow lasts only a few minutes. Therefore, Haijie Guo et al.18 synthesized BaZrSi3O9:Eu2+,Pr3+ by high-temperature solid-state reaction technology, which is a cyan long afterglow luminescent material. After stopping the radiation source, the phosphorescent luminescence performance could last for 15 hours in the dark. It was found that the phosphor has a continuous distribution trap of 0.64–0.72 eV; this shows that phosphors have good cyan luminescence and LLP performance, and have potential for application in night vision illuminators and indicators. Because the difference between the average structure and the local coordination environment will lead to the difference in Eu2+ luminescence, Yang Zhang et al.19 proposed to prepare the Ba2(1 − x)Zr2Si3O12(BZSO):xEu2+phosphor by using smaller Ca2+and Sr2+ instead of Ba2+, realized the controllable emission of phosphors from green to cyan, and improved the thermal quenching performance. Chunmeng Liu et al.20 prepared Sr8(Si4O12)Cl8:Eu2+ by a high-temperature solid-phase reaction. Its high emission intensity (~148% and ~280% of commercial BAM) under VUV light and low-voltage electron beam excitation, and the attenuation time is about 0.9 μs. In addition, due to its fast attenuation characteristics, it has become a potential application material for the development of three-dimensional display technology (3d-PDP and 3d-FEDs). Mengfei Zhang et al.21 prepared Sr3−3xY2−2y(Si3O9)2:3xEu2+,2yTb3+ phosphors by a high-temperature solid-state reaction. The energy transfer mechanism between Eu2+ and Tb3+ is explored as a quadrupole interaction. It is found that in the SYSO host, the energy transfer efficiency can reach 89.4% and the luminous efficiency can reach 89%, which is more suitable for WLED devices. Ishwar Prasad Sahu et al.22 prepared long afterglow SrCaMgSi2O7:Eu2+,Dy3+ cyan phosphors by a high-temperature solid-state reaction. SrCaMgSi2O7:Eu2+,Dy3+ phosphors have better thermal stability and water resistance than SrAl2O4:Eu23 and CaYAl3O7:Eu,24 and have a wider range of applications. Isabel Pajares et al.25 synthesized a single-phase fluorinated apatite compound Ca10(SiO4)3(SO4)3F2(CSSF). The rare-earth ion doped CSSF has good stability and compatibility with high-efficiency luminescent materials. Meidan Que et al.26 synthesized Eu2+ doped CSSF phosphors. It was found that Eu2+ ions randomly occupy the position of Ca2+ ions in the crystal structure of CSSF. When the temperature reached 140 °C, the emission peak intensity of CSSF:Eu2+ was 52.94% of the initial value. Although the PL intensity decreases to 84.21% compared with (Sr,Ba)SiO4:Eu2+, the thermal stability of the CSSF:Eu2+ phosphor has been greatly improved.

Silicate based phosphors have excellent luminescent properties and better structure, physical and chemical stability than aluminate based phosphors. Because the spectral region of cyan emission wavelength is narrow (480–520 nm), cyan phosphors with good LLP performance are very rare. However, aluminate based LLP materials soaked in water for several hours will lead to the continuous degradation, which hinders their practical application. Silicate based LLP materials have better chemical and physical stability, thermal stability and easy synthesis, but their afterglow intensity and long duration are weaker than those of the excellent aluminate based LLP materials. According to the experimental results of previous researchers, the coordination environment of its activator ions can be changed by changing the type and proportion of cations in the silicate matrix and adding anions to obtain luminescent materials with more excellent optical properties.
Haipeng Ji et al.27 prepared (a,b)Ca3(PO4)2:Eu2+ phosphors by the high-temperature solid-state reaction. The phosphor is divided into a and b phases. The symmetry of a-TCP:Eu2+ is lower than that of b-TCP:Eu2+, and the rigidity is smaller. a-TCP:Eu2+ phosphor shows bright visible cyan luminescence under UV excitation, and the QE is 77.56%, but the thermal stability is low. Haijie Guo et al.28 used Eu2+,Dy3+ co-doped a-Ca3(PO4)2 to synthesize a new cyan long afterglow fluorescent material, formed a continuous trap with a depth distribution of 0.71 eV, which improved the excitation limit of a-TCP:Eu2+ phosphor and greatly improved its thermal stability. The doping of Dy3+ increases the continuous luminescence of a-TCP:Eu2+ from 1 minute to 5 hours. Peipei Dang et al.29 synthesized b-(1 − x)Ca3(PO4)2–xCa9Y(PO4)7(x = 0–1.0) phosphors by high-temperature solid-state reaction. By adjusting the ratio of Eu2+/Eu3+, tunable luminescence of fluorescent red–white–cyan is realized; by adjusting the content of Mn2+, the tunable luminescence of phosphor blue–cyan–red is realized; by constructing solid solution and adjusting the overall concentration, the tunable luminescence of the whole white light region can be realized, which has a great impact on the design of single-phase warm white light and new tunable fluorescent lamps. Jianwei Qiao et al.30 synthesized Eu2+ activated K2BaCa(PO4)2(KBCPO) phosphor by high-temperature solid-state reaction for the first time. The phosphor has excellent thermal stability and the prepared WLED lamp has a high CRI (Ra = 83), which shows great application potential and research value (Fig. 4). Xinguo Zhang et al.31 synthesized a new tunable Eu2+/Mn2+ Co-doped K2BaCa(PO4)2 phosphor by the high-temperature solid-state reaction. WLED was prepared by combining KBCP:Eu2+,Mn2+ phosphors with a chip; although Ra (74.4) decreases, it has high QE (>70%) and current stability up to 300 mA. The authors did not carefully study the energy transfer mechanism (ET) between Eu2+ and Mn2+ in KBCPO. In 2021, Peng Wang et al.32 synthesized K2BaCa(PO4)2(KBCPO):[Eu2+,Si4+],Mn2+ phosphor by solid-state reaction, and designed [Eu2+, Si4+] → [K+, P5+] charge compensation strategy for the first time. The charge compensation enhances the emission of Eu2+ and the thermal stability of luminescent materials. It was also found that the ET mechanism of Eu2+ → Mn2+ was determined by the electron–multipole interaction (Table 1).

Phosphates activated with different rare-earth elements are widely used as phosphors due to physical and chemical stability and relatively mild preparation conditions. However, for phosphors doped with a phosphate host by single activator ions, it is not easy to obtain excellent cyan emission phosphors. Therefore, the mechanism of continuous emission and continuous energy transfer between Eu2+ ions and Dy3+ can be used to achieve a wider range of tunable emission. In addition to the change of activator ions, K+ co-substitution of monovalent cations such as Na+, construction of the β-potassium sulfate (β-K2SO4) structure and the strategy of replacing P5+ with Si4+ can also help design cyan phosphors with excellent thermal stability and luminous intensity.
2.2 Ce3+ as excitation center
Jiyou Zhong et al.33 synthesized Ca2LnZr2Ga3O12 (Ln = La, Y, Lu, and Gd) by high-temperature solid-state reaction. Under 430 nm excitation wavelength, the QE of the phosphor is 35.2%. When the temperature increases to 100 °C, only about 48% of the emission intensity is retained. The authors suggest that the thermal quenching performance of phosphors is poor because the energy gap between the 5d excited state and 4f ground state potential energy curve is greater than 0.81 eV and the bottom of the conduction band is lower than the intersection of the 5d excited state potential energy curve and the 4f ground state potential energy curve (Fig. 5). Jiyou Zhong et al.34 used the same method to synthesize Ca3Zr2SiGa2O12 phosphor. The internal quantum efficiency of the phosphor is about 42.7%. When the temperature increases to 100 °C, it still retains 73% of the initial emission intensity at room temperature, and the thermal stability needs to be further improved. Xinghong Gong et al.35 synthesized a series of Ce3+-doped Ca2REZr2(AlO4)3:Ce3+(RE = Lu, Y, Gd) phosphors by solid-state reaction. It was found that increasing the radius of RE3+ will reduce the effective energy barrier of the nonradiative relaxation process and enhance the thermal quenching performance. In addition, in 2011, De-Yin Wang et al.36 synthesized BaHfSi3O9:Eu2+ phosphor by solid-state reaction. It was found that the phosphor containing Hf element has excellent thermal stability. The optimal absorption efficiency and quantum efficiency of BaHfSi3O9:Eu2+ phosphors are about 78% and 50%, respectively. The luminous intensity at 150 °C is about 86% of that at room temperature, and it still maintains 68% of its initial value at 300 °C, and its working temperature can increase up to 450 K, showing good thermal stability. Qiyue Shao et al.37 prepared Lu3Al5O12:Ce3+ by the high-temperature solid-state reaction. It was found that Lu3+ doping is also conducive to thermal stability. The phosphor is quenched to about 83% of the emission intensity at 250 °C. Compared with pure YAG:Ce3+ phosphor, the thermal quenching performance is greatly improved. The authors suggest that with the increase of the Lu3+ content, the “Stokes shift” will decrease, which significantly improves the thermal quenching performance. Zs. Rak et al.38 found that doping Hf element in Ca3(Ti,Zr,Hf,Sn)2Fe2SiO12 could generate a higher energy (more than 4.0 eV) in the conduction band of garnet, which will be beneficial to its thermal stability. Xin Ding et al.39 synthesized Ca3Hf2SiAl2O12:xCe3+ phosphor by the traditional high-temperature solid-state reaction method. The phosphor shows broad cyan emissions in the wavelength range of 450–500 nm under 400 nm UV excitation. The emission intensity can reach 72.1% of YAG:Ce3+, with better thermal stability and excellent quantum efficiency (74.7%). Xicheng Wang et al.40 synthesized a series of Ca2LuHf2(AlO4)3:Ce3+ phosphors using the traditional high-temperature solid-phase method. The optimum quantum efficiency of the phosphor is 50.3% and the bandgap value is 4.15 eV. When the temperature increases to 150 °C, the emission intensity of CLHA:Ce3+ retains 87% of the initial value, which is better than that of the commercial (Sr,Ba)2SiO4:Eu2+ phosphor. The CCT of WLED prepared with the CLHA:Ce3+ phosphor is 4882 K. Although it is known that the doping of Lu3+ will improve the thermal stability of phosphors, the replacement effect of Ce3+ and Lu3+ needs to be further studied. Wonsik Ahn et al.41 prepared the Lu3−xCexAl5O12(LuAG:xCe3+) phosphor. It was found that at a synthesis temperature of 1700 °C it was easier to promote the incorporation of Ce3+ at the Lu3+ site than at a temperature of 1600 °C with the increase of x; the emission spectrum of the phosphor shows red shift. The solubility limit of Ce3+ in Lu3Al5O12 was about 3 mol%. If the content of the Ce element exceeded the solubility limit, it would lead to the formation of the impurity phase. The reduction mechanism of Ce4+ to Ce3+ in the air atmosphere and the effect of Ga substitution on the structure (including particle morphology) are not fully understood, so further research is needed (Fig. 6). J. Bárta et al.42 synthesized (Gd1−xLux)3(Ga1−yAly)5O12:Ce phosphor by photochemical synthesis. The authors found that drying and calcination in the air up to 1400 °C prevent or limit Ga evaporation. Ga3+ replacing Al3+ can change the photoluminescence (PL) of the phosphor. Doping Gd and Ga elements will produce red-shift and blue-shift, respectively. Jiwon Kim et al.43 synthesized Lu2.91Al5−xGaxO12:0.09Ce3+ powder by solid-state reaction. The authors found that the Ce4+ → Ce3+ reduction could be achieved during calcination under air atmosphere at a high temperature of 1700 °C through charge compensation, and the substitution of Ga makes the lattice constant, particle size increase, emission peak appeared blue shift, tunable light emission (from green to cyan) and the emission intensity of LAG2O:Ce3+ is about 110% greater than that of LAO:Ce3+. Liangling sun et al.44 synthesized Ca2LuZr2(AlO4)3(CLZA):Ce cyan phosphor by high-temperature solid-state reaction technology. The emission intensity at 423 K remains about 67% of that at 303 K; in addition, the prepared LED lamp has Ra = 89.2 and CCT = 3538 K.

The aluminate garnet structure has three types: large dodecahedron, small octahedron and tetrahedron. Ce3+ ions exhibit wide absorption and emission bands in the electron transition process, and the positions of excitation and emission peaks are mainly dependent on the lattice position of the host. In particular, in garnet crystals, Ce3+ can emit ultraviolet light as well as visible light. However, the thermal quenching performance of Ce3+ doped ordinary garnet phosphor is not good, so some cations such as Ga, Gd, Hf and Lu need to be used to change the lattice constant, improve the thermal stability, and even realize coordinated light emission. However, the modification of the host may make the preparation process complex, which is not conducive to its practical application. In addition, further research is needed for finding other rare-earth ions doped alone or forming double doped garnet phosphor with Ce3+.
Silicate host phosphors have good stability, visible light transparency, environmental friendliness and easy preparation. In 2010, W. W. Maria et al.45 first reported a NaBaScSi2O7 single-crystal compound. Sudeshna Ray et al.46 prepared a new cyan-emitting RbBaScSi3O9:Eu2+ phosphor. The study of the electronic structure, characteristic photoluminescence, lifetime and thermal quenching characteristics of RbBaScSi3O9:Eu2+ phosphor revealed its great potential for application in WLEDs and the method of “density functional theory” was used to provide a new idea for the development of new phosphors (Fig. 7). Chengying Liu et al.47 synthesized NaBaScSi2O7 green phosphor doped with Eu2+ through a solid-state reaction. Under the excitation of 365 nm light, the phosphor shows a luminous efficiency of about 65%, and the luminous intensity decreased to 88.7% of the initial value at 150 °C. After aging the phosphor sample for 100 hours at 423 K, only 4.6% PL degradation was observed, which further proved that the prepared sample had excellent thermal stability. Jiasong Zhong et al.48 prepared a new type of KBaScSi2O7:Eu2+(KBSS:Eu2+) phosphor through solid-state reaction. The phosphor has an ultra-high quantum efficiency of 91.3%, a WLED color rendering index (Ra) of 88.6, related color temperature (CCT = 3770 K), and luminous efficiency (LE = 21 lm W−1), with a lifetime of 923.98 ns, and the luminous intensity at 423 K retained 90% of that at room temperature, this is because the substitution of Sc makes the KBS host have a better rigid environment. Yuhan Zhou et al.49 synthesized KBaScSi2O7:Ce3+ (KBSS:Ce3+) by a high temperature solid-state reaction. The LED prepared with this phosphor can produce strong warm white light with high Ra (83.4) and low CCT (3652 K). The CL intensity retains 45% of the initial value within 40 minutes after long-time electron bombardment, which will not suddenly decrease with the increase of voltage, which indicates that it has high saturation current and saturation voltage, has good color stability under low voltage and is a promising FEDs material. Ye Li et al.50 made phosphors emit different colors of light by adjusting different positions of the Sr2SiO4 host, which showed its potential application in LED devices and solar cells. Zhengce An et al.51 through the study of Ca20Al26Mg3Si3O68:Ce3+,Tb3+ found that with the increase of Ce3+ concentration, the emission intensity of Tb3+ first increased, and the concentration quenching phenomenon occurred until Ce3+ reached a certain concentration, which confirmed that there was energy transfer between Ce3+ and Tb3+, but did not introduce its transfer mode in detail. Jinxing Zhao et al.52 synthesized Ca15(PO4)2(SiO4)6:Ce3+,Tb3+ phosphors by high-temperature solid-state reaction method, which can prepare LED with good luminescence tuning and high thermal stability. In addition, the author also proposed that the “exchange interaction” between Ce3+ and Tb3+ is the main energy transfer mode, and the maximum transfer efficiency is 44.1%. Xiaojuan Yang et al.53 used lithium carbonate (Li2CO3) as a charge compensation agent to synthesize Sr2SiO4:Tb3+,Lu3+ phosphors by the high-temperature solid-state reaction. By doping Tb3+ and Lu3+, the UV absorption efficiency and luminescence intensity of phosphors can be improved. Tianpeng Yu et al.54 synthesized blue-green SSO:Tb3+,Ce3+ phosphors by the high-temperature solid-state reaction method. The QE of the phosphor reaches 43.67%. When the temperature is increased to 200 °C, the SSO:Tb3+,Ce3+ phosphor still retains 90% of the photoluminescence intensity, which indicates that it has good thermal stability. At the same time, the author reveals that the energy transfer mechanism from Ce3+ to Tb3+ in the SSO host is the electric multipole interaction.

Scandium silicate includes a special 3D frame structure composed of octahedron and tetrahedron, which provides a site position for Ce3+ substitution. When Ce3+ is in the octahedral position in scandium silicate, it can produce good stability, and the stable physical and chemical properties also make the scandium silicate an excellent rare-earth ion doping host. Scandium silicate can also provide an excellent crystal chemical environment for a variety of doped rare-earth ions, which indicates that the luminescent properties of scandium silicate-based phosphors can be adjusted by co-doping with a variety of ions. There is a huge energy transfer process from Ce3+ to Tb3+ ions in the main body of scandium silicate, so the co-doping of Ce3+ and Tb3+ can realize the coordinated emission of phosphor and improve its luminous intensity. In addition, replacing the silicate with phosphate partially also makes the phosphor show excellent luminescence tuning performance and higher thermal stability.
In 1994, Douglas A. Keszler et al.55 found that Sr atoms can replace Ba atoms and reach the solubility shown by the stoichiometric ratio of Ba3Sr4(BO3)3F5, and prepared a new non-central symmetric borate of Ba3Sr4(BO3)3F5(BSBF), but its optical properties are not characterized. In 2009, Guochun Zhang et al.56 conducted a detailed study on BSBF and found that the BSBFZ structure is hexagonal and the space group is P63mc. It is transparent to light in the wavelength range of 270–2550 nm, with a maximum transmittance of more than 85% and an ultraviolet cut-off wavelength of about 210 nm. Its melting point is 1174.3 °C and shows melt consistency and chemical stability. Jianfeng Sun et al.57 synthesized BSBF:Ce3+,Tb3+ and Na+, a tunable cyan luminescent material, through high-temperature solid-state reaction. The average lifetime of the phosphor is 34.09 ns. The energy transmission efficiency from Ce3+ to Tb3+ in BSBF is as high as 82.16%. The thermal quenching value of the phosphor at 293 K and 373 K is 45.64% and 68.36%, respectively. Jiyou Zhong et al.58 prepared NaMgBO3:Ce3+ phosphor by the high-temperature solid-state reaction. It was found that the heterovalent substitution of Ce3+ for Na+ caused antisite defects in the crystal and balanced the charge. It also makes NaMgBO3:Ce3+ produce excellent cyan emission, with high (internal) quantum efficiency, small thermal degradation effects, and zero chromaticity drift at high temperatures. PLQY is as high as 93% (Fig. 8). Dashuai Sun et al.59 prepared Y3Si6N11:Ce3+ phosphor, and found that the phosphor had a dual perovskite structure, resulting in two different Ce3+ emission centers, namely, a green center (539 nm) and a red center (600 nm). Shihai You et al.60 synthesized Ba2CaB2Si4O14:xCe3+ phosphor through conventional solid-state reaction. The quantum efficiency of the phosphor can reach 54%. Ce3+ occupies the double sites of Ba2+ and Ca2+ in the crystal, resulting in excellent broadband cyan emission. It also brings a large bandgap (Eg = 6.5 eV) and a relatively rigid crystal structure (YD = 495 K) to BCBSO, which improves its thermal stability (Table 2).

In addition to aluminate, silicate and phosphate, borate is also an important host material for rare-earth ion doping. Its simple synthesis conditions and low raw material price endow it with great application potential. Among them, the borate phosphor (NaMBO3:Ce3+, M = Ca, Sr, Ba) doped with Ce3+ ion has excellent cyan emission. However, there are a few reports on excellent borate based cyan phosphors, and further research is needed.

2.3 Other ions as excitation center
In 1971, Johnson et al.61 successfully prepared the first up-conversion laser with BaY2F8 crystal as the host and doped with Ho3+ and Yb3+ ions. In 1990, J. Y. Allain et al.62 found that Ho3+ doped fluoro-zirconate could achieve coordinated emission within 540–553 nm. I. R. Martín et al.63 prepared Yb3+–Ho3+ doped fluoridate glasses, and studied its up-conversion emission mechanism under 975 nm light excitation, and the up-conversion efficiency with temperature in the range of 12 to 295 K. D. S. Funk et al.64 studied the development of rare-earth-doped fiber lasers. These lasers can emit light in wavelengths ranging from 381 nm to the near infrared, with power greater than 100 mW; these lasers have great application potential in low-power facilities such as medical diagnosis, redrawing, and lithography. M. J. Weber et al.65,66 studied the spectral and optical transition probabilities of YAP:Ho3+ at room temperature and the laser action of YAP:Ho3+ in the infrared region. M. Malinowski et al.67 found that due to the 5s2–5i8 transition, the holmium compound could produce a strong green (550 nm) emission with a maximum lifetime of 7.4 ms. It is also found that the lifetime of the 3d3 level at low temperature and low concentration is 7.9 ms, but the analysis of the 3d3 level is not detailed enough. Osiac et al.68 further explained it. Zengmei Wang et al.69 studied a series of transitions of Ho3+ in the La3Ga5SiO14 crystal, including 5s2 → 5i8, 5s2 → 5i7,5f5 → 5i8, and 5i7 → 5i8. And the radiation 5s2 → 5i8 transition with green ray of 540 nm, 5f5 → 5i8 transition and 5s2 → 5i7 transition with red ray of 644 and 748 nm, respectively, are likely to provide some practical application as a laser material. Zhi-Yong Mao et al.70 proposed the addition of a charge compensator (Li+) to adjust the valence state of Eu, to change the relative amount of Eu2+/Eu3+ and enhance the energy transfer of Eu2+/Eu3+. The author found that as long as polyvalent Eu ions coexist, effective energy transfer between Eu2+ and Eu3+ occurs. With this energy transfer, tunable single-subject panchromatic luminescence can be achieved. W. J. Park et al.71 found by studying Bi-doped Y2O3:Eu phosphor that Bi3+ can be used as sensitizers for Eu3+ under excitation at 350 nm, and Bi3+ can transfer energy to Eu3+ ions, thus enhancing the emission intensity of Eu3+. Due to the 1S0 → 3P1 transition of Bi3+, the phosphor will have a strong absorption band in the near-ultraviolet region. The co-doping of Eu and Bi will increase the lattice parameters and improve the luminescence performance of phosphors. Bao-Gai Zhai et al.72 utilizes a sol–gel combustion method to prepare Dy3+-doped aluminate (BaAl2O4:Dy3+) phosphor without the presence of Eu2+.73–75 It is found that the long afterglow color of BaAl2O4:Dy3+ phosphor is blue-green, which breaks the widely held view that the blue-green afterglow of phosphor is produced by the luminescence center of Eu2+, and has a great impact on revealing the long afterglow mechanism of rare-earth doped alkali metal aluminates. Considering the excellent thermal stability and dielectric properties of the LaAlO3 host (Fig. 9). T. K. Visweswara Rao et al.76 prepared LaAlO3:Bi3+,Ho3+ phosphors by the polyol mediated method, the phosphor not only has the blue emission of Bi3+, but also has the strong green emission of Ho3+. The efficient energy transfer from Bi3+ to Ho3+ in the LaAlO3 host also produces color tunability from blue to cyan, which can be used as a field emission display device.

Inset: the CIE chromaticity diagram to show the chromaticity coordinates of the afterglow and PL from BaAl2O4:Dy3+ phosphors; and (b) afterglow decay curve of BaAl2O4:Dy3+ phosphors with the dopant concentration of 4 mol%. 
Rare-earth elements are functional luminescence resources because they have a large number of energy levels and unique electronic structures. Bi3+ doped with a suitable matrix can also produce excellent light emission. The Bi3+ and Ho3+ co-doped LaAlO3 host can produce excellent cyan emission. Therefore, it is important to design a host that has an energy transfer mechanism between rare-earth and non-rare-earth ions and that can provide excitation and emission sites for two or more doped ions.
Zhengwei Liu et al.77 prepared a long afterglow CaSnO3:Tb3+ phosphor by solid-state reaction method, and the afterglow time can last for about 4 h. To explain this phenomenon, the author proposed a “reversible energy transfer”, that is, after the electrons in the electron trap release heat energy into the conduction band, the electrons and holes in the valence band form STE (an energy state of excited electrons). The energy stored in the STE will be partially or completely transferred to Tb3+ in a resonant manner so that Tb3+ is excited and emits a photon, and then returns to the ground state, and the remaining energy will be converted into heat energy. Importantly, the author believes that these three processes are reversible. To explore the LPP mechanism in detail, Bingfu Lei et al.78 synthesized CaSnO3:Sm3+ phosphor in two steps. The authors suggest that an electron trap is formed in the CaSnO3 matrix due to the non-equivalent substitution of Sm3+ for Ca2+. When the excitation source is turned on, the holes or electrons in the matrix are captured by different defect centers, and then the excitation source is turned off. The trapped electrons or holes will recombine with the electrons or holes captured by other defect centers due to heat release. The energy released by the recombination of holes and electrons will activate ions. However, the slow-release ratio of the energy transferred from the trap leads to the long afterglow emission of characteristic activated ions. Through the preparation and research of CaSnO3:Eu3+ phosphor, Jinsu Zhang et al.79 found that the Eu3+–Eu3+ energy transfer process has little effect on the temperature quenching of the 5d0 level of the Eu3+. Therefore, the author concluded that the cross-process plays a leading role in the fluorescence quenching of the 5d0 level. Changran Zheng et al.80 synthesized a new cyan long afterglow luminescent material CaSnO3:Lu3+ by the high-temperature solid-state reaction. Doping of Lu3+ will produce appropriate electron or hole trap depths and prolong the afterglow phenomenon. It was found that the continuous afterglow of CaSnO3:Lu3+ phosphors is produced by appropriate hole or electron traps. Pengxiang Pei et al.81 successfully synthesized a new multi-color tunable NaCa2GeO4F:xTb3+ phosphor by the high-temperature solid-state reaction, and the author designed an anti-counterfeiting application, which can easily detect dynamic characteristics by using a portable ultraviolet lamp. Therefore, NaCa2GeO4F:xTb3+ phosphors have potential application prospects in anti-counterfeiting. Guifang Ju et al.82 studied Ca4YO(BO3)3:Bi3+,Eu3+ phosphor and found that Bi3+ emission is completely quenched, while Bi3+ and Eu3+ single-doped samples show high luminescence efficiency, which is caused by the electron transfer from Bi3+ to Eu3+, rather than the effective energy transfer from Bi3+ to Eu3+. Rong Liu et al.83 found that Bi3+ in YVO4:Bi3+,Eu3+ phosphors could not only act as sensitizers, but also generate luminescence centers. The addition of Bi3+ can make the phosphor generate broadband luminescence center under the excitation of 319 nm ultraviolet light, and also make the color of the emitted light change from red to green. Since the phosphor above does not match the n-UV chip of 360–420 nm, Mingsheng Cai et al.84 enhanced the absorption band (200–350 nm) of the BaScO2F host to the region of 200–450 nm by doping Bi3+. Moreover, by doping Na+, K+ and Rb+, the photoluminescence and thermal stability of the phosphor are further improved (Fig. 10). In particular, the addition of K+ not only strengthens the structural rigidity of the phosphor, but also increases the cyan emission intensity by 34.4%, and the thermal stability at 423 K reached 87% of that at room temperature (Table 3).

Lu3+ can act as sensitizer in the CaSnO3 host, generate energy transfer with activator, also produce excellent cyan emission, and generate trap center, which can improve the long afterglow performance of phosphor. Moreover, Lu3+ doping can increase the crystal rigidity and improve the thermal stability of phosphors. In addition, for non-rare-earth elements, Bi3+ doped phosphors can produce cyan emission. However, their luminescence is very complex, and different subjects and coordination environments will have certain effects on the luminescence characteristics. Doping Bi3+ and Eu3+ in the Ca4YO(BO3)3 host alone can produce light emission. When Bi3+ and Eu3+ are co-doped, it causes the luminescence quenching of Bi3+, but in the YVO4 host, Bi3+ and Eu3+ generate energy transfer and form coordinated emission. It can be seen that although the luminescence characteristics of Bi3+ are easily affected by many factors, they still have great research value in the field of luminescent materials. Because of Bi3+ unique luminescent properties, it has great application potential.
3. Blue phosphor system
3.1 Ce3+ as an excitation center
Borates have great application potential in the field of luminescent materials because of their low synthesis temperature, rich structural diversity, and good chemical and physical stability. Jianfeng sun et al.85 synthesized NaCaBO3:Ce3+,Mn2+ phosphor by solid-state reaction. The phosphor has a lifetime of 54.98 ns and broad emission peak. Through the resonant energy transfer between Ce3+ and Mn2+, the coordinated transformation of phosphor from green to red is realized. Its quantum yield can reach 33%, and it can produce CRI (90.7) and warm white light with a lower CCT value (4046 K) under n-UV excitation. Xinguo Zhang et al.86,87 prepared NaCaBO3:Ce3+,Tb3+,Mn2+ phosphors and NaCaBO3:Ce3+ phosphors by the solid phase reaction, respectively. It is found that the emission of phosphors from blue to green and blue to red can be achieved by the energy transfer of Ce3+ → Tb3+ and Ce3+ → Mn2+. Qingbo Liu et al.88 prepared Ba1.95B2O5:0.05Ce3+ by the solid-state reaction; the phosphor has good thermal stability, and the emission intensity can reach 81% of the initial value at 200 °C. In addition, the position of the emission peak of the phosphor will be blue shifted with the increase of temperature. Haiming Zhang et al.89 synthesized Ba5(BO3)2(B2O5):Ce3+ blue phosphor by the high-temperature solid-state reaction. At the same time, by comparing the effects of Li+, Na+, and K+ on the emission intensity of phosphor, the author found that doping K+ has the greatest impact on the luminescence properties of phosphor, which not only enhances its luminescence intensity but also improves the quantum yield and thermal stability (Fig. 11).
 Fig. 11  (a) Crystal structure of Ba5(BO3)2(B2O5); and (b) emission spectra of Ba4.92(BO3)2(B2O5):0.04Ce3+,0.04 M+(M = Li, Na and K) and Ba4.96(BO3)2(B2O5):0.04Ce3+ phosphors. 
Co-doping of rare earth ions and transition metal ions in the NaCaBO3 can produce synergistic luminescence. In Mn2+ doped NaCaBO3 alone, the light emission intensity is not high, and the energy transfer between Mn2+ and Ce3+ and Tb3+ enhances the emission intensity of Mn2+. Changing the doping ions in the single-phase host to form energy transfer between various ions can improve the luminescence intensity and generate light emission of various colors. However, the co-doping of various ions certainly requires higher requirements for the host. How to develop a new and stable host needs further research.
Martin hermus et al.90 prepared and studied Ba2Y5B5O17:Ce3+ phosphor. It was found that the PLQY of this phosphor was 70%(300 K), T50 = 403 K (T50: the temperature at which the PL strength at room temperature is 50% of its original value). Although its thermal quenching performance is not as good as that of the BaMgAl10O17:Eu2+ blue phosphor (reduced by 20% within 500 K), it is more efficient than the studied yttrium borate containing Ba. Yu Xiao et al.91 successfully improved the stability of Ba2Lu5B5O17:Ce3+ phosphor by doping La3+. It was determined that adding 2% La3+ could successfully yield pure Ba2Lu5B5O17. The IQE of the phosphor reaches 92% and has a broad emission band. The prepared WLED has a low color temperature (4356 K) and high color rendering index (93.2), but its T50 (403 K) is low. Martin Hermus et al.92 synthesized Ba2(Y1−xlux)5B5O17:Ce3+ by a high-temperature solid-state reaction. Because Y3+ is replaced by smaller and harder Lu3+ cations, T50 is increased to 452 K, PLQY is also increased to 90% (300 K). The increase in structural rigidity makes the attenuation and excitation spectra more stable, which shows the important influence of different chemical bonds on the luminescence properties of phosphors. Xinguo Zhang et al.93 proposed different schemes to change the luminescence properties of phosphors through co-doping of Ce3+, Tb3+, and Eu3+. Make the phosphor T50 > 473 K, and the coordinated blue-green-red emission of phosphors can be achieved by changing the proportion of doped ions. Although efficient and stable blue luminescence of Ba2Y5B5O17 can be achieved by Ce3+ doping, the site occupancy of Ce3+ has not been studied in detail. Xiaoxiao Huang et al.94 found that the blue emission of Ba2Y5B5O17:Ce3+ phosphor could be attributed to the disorderly occupation of Y2/Ba2 site by Ce3+. The general chemical formula of CaYAl3O7 is ABC3O7 (A = Ca, Sr, and Ba; B = La, Gd, and Y; C = Al or Ga), which belongs to the pyrite.95 Because of its unique physical structure, CaYAl3O7 has been widely studied in the application of optical materials. Hongwu Zhang et al.96 found that CaYAl3O7:Ce3+ also had electro-mechanical optical properties. The author proposed that Ce3+ ions entering Ca2+ would generate a trap, and the trap energy level was about 0.61 eV, which was the reason for its long afterglow. In addition, it could effectively convert multiple weak energy sources into visible light. This is the cause of its electroluminescence. Hongling Yu et al.97 synthesized a series of CaYAl3O7:Ce3+,Tb3+ phosphors by the combustion method for the first time. Through the study of phosphors, it was found that co-doping Tb3+ would reduce the decaying life of Ce3+, and there was a significant overlap between the excitation and emission bands of Ce3+ and Tb3+; moreover, the green emission of Tb3+ is enhanced, which indicates an efficient energy transfer between the two ions. However, the luminescence characteristics of Ce doped CaYAl3O7 phosphors need to be further studied. Yong Keun Choi et al.98 synthesized CaYAl3O7(CYO):Ce3+ by the solution combustion method. Its color purity is up to 90%, the CCT of the prepared LED lamp is in the range of 2000 to 3500 K, and the LED emits warm white light. It has great application potential in the field of white light lighting and display equipment. To better understand the luminescence process of CaYAl3O7, Giordano et al.99 found that because the radius of the Ce ion is similar to that of the Ca/Y ion, it is likely to replace the Ca/Y site; this may cause the phenomenon of overlapping emission bands. To further study the correlation between Ce3+ concentration and the luminescence of CaYAl3O7 phosphor, Kenta Igashira et al.100 prepared Ce doped CaYAl3O7 single crystal samples by the optical floating zone method. It was found that excessive doping of Ce would increase the non-radiation attenuation rate, and reduce the quantum yield (QY) (Fig. 12).

Ce3+ doped Ba2Y5B5O17 can produce blue emission, and the half-peak width of Ce3+ emission spectrum is narrow, which is derived from the unique crystal structure of Ba2Y5B5O17, which is composed of Y and Ba central polyhedra and BO3 triangular plane, with Ba and Y occupying four crystal independent sites. However, its thermal stability needs to be improved. By replacing Y3+ with La3+ and then regulating the relative contents of Lu3+ and Y3+, the positions of excitation and emission peaks can be shifted. However, the main effect is the increase in the rigidity of the host crystal structure caused by the substitution of large ions for smaller ions, which improves the stability of phosphors. Its essence is caused by the change of the bonding bond. CaYAl3O7 is a kind of pyrite crystal. CaYAl3O7 doped with different rare-earth ions can produce mechanical luminescence, continuous luminescence and up-conversion luminescence. The application potential of CaYAl3O7 can be further improved by substituting Ca2+ and Y3+ with appropriate ions.
Silicate crystal is a good host for rare-earth doped phosphors because of its diversity of structure, transparency to visible light and excellent stability. Yingke Zhao et al.101 successfully synthesized pure Na2CaSiO4 by the sol–gel method and studied its application in in vitro biology. Qingbo Liu et al.102 synthesized Na2CaSiO4:Ce3+ phosphor and reported its luminescence characteristics for the first time. The prepared phosphor has a cubic structure, particle size of about 100 nm, quantum efficiency of 74% and good color purity. It is found that there is energy transfer between Ce3+ in the Na2CaSiO4 host. The author infers that it is due to the electric multipole intercalation. The silicate NaBaScSi2O7 compound has a monoclinic system and its space group symmetry is P21/m,103 it is an excellent luminescent host material. Gen Li et al.104 synthesized NaBaScSi2O7:Ce3+,Tb3+ phosphor by the solid-state reaction. The phosphor has a grain size of 1–20 μm, its internal quantum efficiency is 47%, and it has a high CL (cathodoluminescence) intensity. The spectrum shows that it has a wide excitation band of 250–400 nm, which is in contrast to the ordinary blue phosphor with low luminous efficiency and harsh synthesis conditions. Uwe Kolitsch et al.105 first reported a new type of silicate, which is grown from a molybdate. Its structure is based on the sawtooth chain and then connected by a horseshoe-shaped trisilicate group and an irregular eight coordinated Ba atom. The author only studied the geometric structure and did not further study its application. Jianqing Wang et al.106 studied the optical properties of BaY2Si3O10:Ce3+ phosphor and found that the doping of Ce3+ causes the phosphor to produce blue emission, and also observed the redshift phenomenon. The author proposed that the reason for the “red-shift” phenomenon was the short distance between Ce3+, which led to the increase of the crystal field intensity around Ce3+, affected the 5d band of Ce3+, and finally produced the emission redshift. KBaYSi2O7 has a mixed tetrahedral octahedral skeletal structure, including Si2O7 groups and octahedral coordination Y atoms.107 Xinguo Zhang et al.108 studied KBaYSi2O7:Ce3+ phosphor in detail and proposed another reason for the “red-shift” of Ce3+: the energy transfer of Ce3+ from the high 5d level to the low 5d level, resulting in the reduction of blue light emission. The authors then explain the low lifetime of Ce3+ because of the overlap between its 5d and 4f orbitals. Zhenpeng Zhu et al.109 prepared Ca3ZrSi2O9:Ce3+ silicate phosphor by a high-temperature solid-state reaction. The phosphor has better color purity (90%), internal efficiency (37%), thermal stability (70% initial intensity at 200 °C), and relatively pure blue emission, which the authors attribute to the similarity of crystal field intensity of each Ce3+ occupied site. Quansheng Wu et al.110 systematically studied Li2Ca2Si2O7:Ce3+ blue phosphor. LiO4 and SiO4 tetrahedra are connected to each other to form a rigid three-dimensional network (Fig. 13). This rigid structure endows the phosphor with excellent thermal stability and CL intensity. At 200 °C, after 60 minutes of continuous electron bombardment, phosphors can also maintain 86% and 92% of the initial intensity. Its high quantum yield (63%) also makes it a very potential luminescent material (Table 4).

Silicates are an important host of rare-earth doped phosphors. Some silicates composed of alkali atoms and alkaline earth atoms have a variety of different crystal structures. Among them, KBaYSi2O7, NaBaScSi2O7, Ca3ZrSi2O9 and Li2Ca2Si2O7 are polyhedrons formed by metal elements and oxygen elements and then form a three-dimensional grid. The symmetrical and balanced structure of octahedron and decahedron increases the rigidity of the host lattice and improves the thermal stability of phosphors. In addition, the change of metal elements in the host also has a certain impact on other optical properties of the phosphor. For example, in Ca3ZrSi2O9, Ce3+ occupies the site of Ca2+, the emission peak in the emission spectrum is narrow, the color purity is high, and it has a high quantum yield and stable emission under high temperature and continuous electron beam bombardment, as well as special properties such as optical/thermal stability and low thermal conductivity, which make its application potential greater. Although the emission peak of Ce3+ doped Li2Ca2Si2O7 is broad and the color purity is low, its crystal structure is more symmetric. It is interconnected by LiO4 and SiO4 tetrahedra through common edges or angles. This rigid structure can suppress the occurrence of local structural relaxation of Ce3+. This results in an efficient and thermally stable launch. In addition, the high mobility of lithium ions endows it with good conductivity, and its synthesis temperature is also relatively low. These factors also make lithium-containing alkaline earth silicate phosphors have great practical application value.
3.2 Eu2+ as an excitation center
M. G. Krzhizhanovskaya et al.111 prepared single-phase Sr3B2SiO8:Eu3+ phosphor by the solid-phase method. It is found that Sr3B2SiO8 begins to form at 900 °C, and can be completely formed at 1100–1200 °C, but will decompose below 900 °C. In addition, the phosphor also has the anisotropy of thermal expansion, which is believed to be caused by the strong vibration of Sr. Yuhua Wang et al.112 prepared Sr3B2SiO8:Eu phosphors in air and reducing atmosphere, respectively. It was found that the phosphors prepared in air display Eu3+ and Eu2+ emissions at the same time. After light excitation at different wavelengths, the emission color can be switched between red and blue (254 nm, Eu3+ dominant, red; 365 nm, Eu2+ dominant, blue). The phosphor prepared in a reducing atmosphere shows pure blue emission at 340 nm excitation. M. P. Saradhi et al.113 synthesized MB2Si2O8 [M = Sr, Ba]:Eu2+ phosphor in a reducing atmosphere (5%H2 + 95%N2) [Sr, Ba]B2Si2O8:Eu2+ phosphor. The author found that the rigid three-dimensional network structure of the host can achieve high-temperature stability of divalent rare-earth ions even in a non-reducing atmosphere. By co-doping with Tb3+, the luminescence characteristics of the white region can also be improved to produce strong blue-white emission. T. Q. Leow et al.114 prepared SrB2Si2O8:Eu2+ phosphors by the solid-state reaction method. The author found that Eu2+ would be reduced abnormally even in an oxidizing atmosphere, and the doping of Dy3+ will further lead to the reduction of Eu ions. The reduced Eu ion doping makes the phosphor emit pure blue, and the doping of Dy3+ will lead to phosphor from blue to reddish-purple transition. Lihua He et al.115 synthesized (Ca0.8Ba1.2)1−xMgxSiO4:yEu2+ phosphor by a high temperature solid-state reaction. The doping of the Mg ions will change the phosphor from light blue to dark blue, and the luminous intensity could be increased by 100%. Doped with appropriate Mg ions, the phosphor particle size will be uniform, smooth surface, and will not produce obvious crystal defects. Yuanhua Lin et al.116 prepared long afterglow blue Ca3MgSi2O8:Eu2+,Dy3+ phosphors. In their research, they compared a series of host materials and found that Ca3MgSi2O8 has the best long afterglow phosphorescence performance. A. A. Sabbagh Alvani et al.117 prepared long afterglow Sr3MgSi2O8:Eu,Dy phosphors by sintering at high temperatures in a reducing atmosphere. The author found that when the concentration of Dy remains unchanged, moderately increasing Eu will increase the emission intensity, and when an appropriate doping ratio is reached, it will also increase its luminescence intensity. Doping Dy3+ can produce crystal defects, which make the phosphors to glow continuously. Liming Liang et al.118 synthesized a series of new luminescent materials Ca9La(PO4)5(SiO4)Cl2:xEu2+(CLPSCl:Eu2+) through a high-temperature solid-state reaction. The phosphor can produce a wide absorption band of 220–440 nm in the UV wavelength range and produce strong blue emission, which can be effectively excited by the UV LED chip (Fig. 14).

CaB2Si2O8 is a natural alkaline borosilicate mineral with a rigid structure that can confine high-level radioactive waste. Ce3+-doped CaB2Si2O8 has a small Stokes shift, which also reflects that its lattice is hard and its non-radiation relaxation is small. This is due to the existence of B3+ with a small ionic radius and the unique geometry of the crystal. Although due to some of its properties it can be used as an optical material, it is difficult to synthesize it artificially. The compounds SrB2Si2O8, BaB2Si2O8 and CaB2Si2O8 formed by replacing Ca2+ with the same main group elements Ba and Sr of Ca not only have similar crystal structures, but also are easy to be synthesized. For Ca3MgSi2O8 and Sr3MgSi2O8, the element Mg replaces the element B, which can narrow the emission peak of the phosphor emission spectrum, but the ionic radius of Mg2+ is larger than that of B3+, which may also lead to changes in the rigidity of the host crystal structure.
Junying Zhang et al.119 doped Er3+ and Nd3+ into BaMgAl10O17:Eu2+ phosphor, making it easier for the phosphor to absorb the excitation energy in the UV region and improve the luminous intensity in the vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) region. The size of phosphor particles prepared by a sol–gel process is small and homogeneous. Kwang Bok Kim et al.120 synthesized BaMgAl10O17:Eu2+ phosphor by solid-state calcination using AlF3 as flux. The relationship between the structure and optical properties of blue phosphor and the concentration of Eu in BaMgAl10O17 has been studied in detail. The best quantum efficiency of phosphor can reach 92.4%, and most particles decay within 100 μs. The optical properties of BaMgAl10O17:Eu2+ phosphors are degraded by long-term exposure to vacuum UV light, but this degradation process at the atomic level has not been explained in detail. Lucia Amidani et al.121 used X-ray to irradiate the sample for a long time to study its degradation process. The author found that in the radiation process, although the structural properties of the crystal will be retained, Eu2+ will be oxidized, resulting in a significant reduction in the luminous intensity. Even if about 56% of Eu2+ will be retained, the luminous intensity is only 1%, which is caused by the formation of crystal defects in the radiation process. Therefore, improving the stability of Eu2+ is an effective method to improve the radiation resistance of BAM:Eu2+. I. Y. Jung et al.122 coated BaMgAl10O17:Eu2+ with SiO2. The particle size of the coated phosphor is 4–8 microns. The author found that SiO2 coating increases the luminous intensity of the phosphor and the brightness of the PDP test panel, to achieve more effective VUV absorption. Seoung-Soo Lee et al.123 prepared BaMgAl10O17:Eu phosphor by thermal shock assisted solid-state reaction. Compared with the traditional solid-state reaction to prepare BAMY phosphor, this method is easier to control the particle morphology and size distribution and does not use the liquid medium harmful to the environment. To improve the thermal degradation of phosphor, Liang-Jun Yin et al.124 used chemical vapor deposition (CVD) to coat BAM phosphor particles with carbon. The results showed that the coated phosphor has higher emission intensity and better high-temperature oxidation resistance. Although carbon coating will reduce the light transmittance, the carbon coating can reduce the surface defects of phosphor and reduce the surface non-radiation transition. In addition, it can prevent oxygen from entering the surface of BAM phosphor, protect the valence state of Eu2+ and improve the emission intensity. Although the above methods can improve the luminescent properties of phosphors, their practical application is limited by the complex preparation process, time-consuming nature, and high cost. Rare-earth doped BaAl12O19 phosphor has attracted a lot of attention because of its simple fabrication, low cost, and good optical properties. Yi Wei et al.125 prepared BaAl12O19(BAO):Eu2+ phosphor by the high-temperature solid-state reaction. It has excellent thermal stability and can emit blue light. The synthesized phosphor has a suitable optical band gap (4.07 eV), which enables efficient doping of Eu2+ and it can produce blue light with a color purity of up to 92%. In addition, due to the highly symmetrical crystal structure of the BAO host, the phosphor also has excellent thermal stability. At 298 K, both luminous intensity and color stability are better than those of BAM phosphor. Shuzhen Liao et al.126 modified the structure by (Ba0.8Eu0.2O)(Al2O3)4.575 × (1 + x)(Ba1+xO:0.2Eu2+) to prepare efficient and thermally stable phosphors. Increasing the Al/Ba ratio will narrow the emission peak, reduce the cell volume, increase the average distance between Eu2+, increase the structural rigidity, and finally improve the quantum efficiency and thermal stability of the phosphor. The emission peak intensity of the tested sample at 200 °C is still 83% of that at room temperature. Siqi Piao et al.127 prepared K1−2x−2yBayAl11O17(KBAO):xEu2+ phosphor. The author found that replacing K+ with Ba2+ can produce crystal defects, which can effectively improve the thermal stability of phosphor, and the quantum efficiency can reach about 91%. The LED lamp made of the KBAO:Eu2+ phosphor has a high Ra (Fig. 15).

BaMgAl10O17:Eu2+ is an efficient blue phosphor, which is widely used in WLEDs and is the main blue phosphor used in plasma display panels (PDP). BaMgAl10O17 belongs to β-alumina, and its structure is characterized by the dense filling of MgAl10O16 units in spinel blocks. It is separated by Ba-O and Eu2+ replaces the 9-coordinated Ba2+ to produce blue emission. However, BaMgAl10O17:Eu2+ phosphor under vacuum ultraviolet irradiation for a long time will lead to poor stability, degradation, and a further decrease in luminous intensity. At first, scientists improved the synthesis method of BaMgAl10O17:Eu2+ phosphor. For example, various fluxes were added to reduce the synthesis temperature of BaMgAl10O17:Eu2+phosphors by the ordinary high-temperature solid phase method. Smaller and more uniform phosphor particles were synthesized by the sol–gel method; the pure BaMgAl10O17 phase synthesized by the “thermal shock method” can improve the particle morphology of phosphor. The BaMgAl10O17:Eu2+ phosphors were then surface modified with coating methods, such as SiO2, MgO, Al2O3, AlPO4, LaPO4 and carbon coating. The coated phosphor can not only improve its chemical stability, but also effectively prevent the oxidation of Eu2+ to Eu3+. Then, the composition of the BaMgAl10O17 host was changed. Since the crystal structure of Ba–Al–O composition samples depends on the Al/Ba ratio, when the content of Al element in the host increases, the unit cell volume and the occupancy of Ba2+ will decrease. The decrease of unit cell volume will lead to a change of crystal structure stiffness, which will affect the thermal stability of phosphors. In addition, since Eu2+ occupies the lattice site of Ba2+, when the occupancy rate of Ba2+ decreases, the average distance between Eu2+ will increase, affecting the light emission of phosphors. BaAl12O19:Eu2+ phosphor has a highly symmetrical crystal structure and more excellent thermal stability. In addition, the introduction of K+ makes the phosphors produce crystal defects, so that the phosphors have zero-TQ characteristics.
Phosphate-based materials have attracted much attention because of their excellent characteristics, such as stable physical and chemical properties, low preparation temperature, and easy control of particle size. They have become popular host materials for rare-earth ion doping. Min Ha Hwang et al.128 synthesized Ca5(PO4)3Cl:Eu2+ by a solid-state reaction. Calcium chloride can act as both flux and chlorine source and can accelerate the solid-state reaction process and improve its luminescence characteristics. The author found that when the amount of CaCl2 is small, multiple phases will form, but when the amount of CaCl2 is increased, it will become a single phase. In addition, the chlorine evaporation caused by high temperatures will greatly affect the luminescence intensity of phosphors. Jie Yu et al.129 used CaCl2 as the chlorine source to prepare Ca5(PO4)3Cl:Eu2+,Mn2+ by the solid-state reaction, which is blue and orange dual-frequency emission phosphors. The difference is that H3BO3 is used as a flux. The introduction of H3BO3 not only promotes crystal growth and ion diffusion effect but also does not introduce impurities. In addition, it is confirmed that the energy transfer form of Eu2+ and Mn2+ in Ca5(PO4)3Cl is not resonance. Although the luminescence characteristics of Ca5(PO4)3Cl:Eu2+ phosphor have been studied, its electronic structure and temperature luminescence correlation have not been studied. Jianghui Zheng et al.130 studied the crystal and electronic structure characteristics of Ca5(PO4)3Cl:Eu2+ phosphor. The activation energy of the phosphor is 0.254 eV, and its relatively high activation energy indicates that the phosphor has good thermal stability and can be used in high-power LED applications. The author also found that the phosphor is excited in the n-UV region due to the charge transition from the Ca-3d state to the O-2p state. The thermal stability of Ca5(PO4)3Cl:Eu2+ phosphors needs to be further improved. To improve the thermal stability of materials, methods such as phosphor solid solution, phosphor ceramic coating (SiO2, TiO2), and glass-ceramics have been adopted, but these methods have little effect on minimizing TQ. Yoon Hwa Kim et al.131 prepared Na3−2xSc2(PO4)3:xEu2+ phosphor. The authors propose that it is due to the polymorphism of the host and the energy transfer from the trap composed of electron–hole pairs to the 5d state of Eu2+ that compensates the emission loss and enhances the emission. In addition, there is a single trap with a high activation energy (0.98 eV) in the high-temperature phase, which will enhance the energy transfer from the defect level to the 5d state of Eu2+. Jiahao Jiao et al.132 synthesized Na3CsMg7(PO4)6 compounds by a high-temperature solid-state reaction. It was found that their structure was a 3D framework composed of isolated PO4 and MgOx (x = 5 and 6), and then Cs ions were located in the tunnel to form the final structure (Fig. 16). In addition, the author also found that Na3CsMg7(PO4)6 crystals with a large size can be rapidly grown by the high-temperature melting method without flux. Lin-Ying Shi et al.133 prepared Na3CsMg7(PO4)6:Eu2+,Mg2+ (NCMP:Eu2+,Mg2+). The author inferred that Eu2+ and Mn2+ mainly occupied Na+ and Mg2+ sites, respectively, and had blue and red double emission bands under 395 nm light excitation. Hang Chen et al.134 studied the crystal structure and photoluminescence properties of NCMP:Eu2+ in detail. Compared with the traditional BAM blue phosphor, it has wider absorption in the n-UV region and weaker UV emission. The quantum yield can reach 88.1%. The emission intensity at 150 °C is 92% of that at room temperature, but the emission integral intensity is higher than that at room temperature. The author believes that the energy transfer from the defect level of Eu2+ to 5d–4f improves its thermal stability (Table 5).

M5(PO4)3X (M = Ca and Sr, X = F, Cl, and Br) is an alkaline earth metal haloapatite. Its structure and chemical bond type are complex, and it can accept different types of dopants. Therefore, its application fields are very wide. Among them, the crystal of Ca5(PO4)3Cl belongs to the hexagonal crystal system, with a P63/m space group. There are two different lattice sites for its Ca element, Ca2 coordinates with nine oxygen atoms, Ca2 coordinates with six oxygen atoms of PO43− and two Cl−, forming a symmetric structure. Eu2+ replaces the site of Ca2, which makes it produce excellent light emission. In the preparation process, it is determined that the raw material CaCl2 can not only act as a flux and a chlorine source; moreover, adding an appropriate amount of CaCl2 can also effectively prevent the generation of heterophase. For NCMP:Eu2+ phosphors, Eu2+ replaces Na+ instead of alkaline earth metal ions, resulting in zero-TQ, which is the embodiment of the compensating emission ability of phosphors. When the temperature of phosphor increases, the structure transformation can be induced to form crystal defects, which can be used as electron capture centers to transfer energy from the trap containing electron–hole pairs to Eu2+ to realize the compensation emission of Eu2+.
3.3 Other ions as an excitation center
Although some blue phosphors activated by rare-earth ions (Ce3+ or Eu2+) have been found and have ideal spectral characteristics, they have severe intrinsic reabsorption effects.135–137 As a major group element, the characteristics of the 6s and 6p orbitals exposed by Bi3+ make its emission range from ultraviolet to the entire visible region and the near-infrared region.138 Since the 1S0 → 3P1 transition of Bi3+ is located in the n-UV region (300–400 nm),139 the phosphor reabsorption problem is successfully solved. Quan Dong et al.140 prepared SrZnSO:xBi3+ phosphors by the solid-state reaction method. Under the excitation of 345 nm, the phosphor host and Bi3+ ions have dual emission. The optimal average life of the sample is 413.81 ns and the absorption efficiency is 73.21%, but its thermal stability is not good (the emission at 150 °C is only 20% of that at RT). In addition, the author also found that with the increase in temperature, although the luminous intensity decreases seriously, the spectrum will be red shifted, covering the emission wavelength range of blue-green light, which is beneficial to improve Ra. Xiaolei Zhu et al.141 prepared SrZnSO:Bi3+,Tb3+,Mn2+, studied the energy transfer between activated ions and found that Bi3+ → Mn2+ and Tb3+ → Mn2+ can occur simultaneously, and the tunable luminescence can be realized through the energy transfer of these three ions. Mogahid H. M. Abdelrehman et al.142 successfully prepared Er3+/Yb3+ Co-doped Gd2O3:Bi3+ by the solution combustion method. It is found that the reflectivity of the crystal increases with the addition of these ions, which is due to the lattice distortion caused by doping ions replacing Gd3+ ions. Qian Chen et al.143 successfully prepared La2MgZr1−xSnxO6:0.02Bi3+(LMZ:0.02Bi3+) phosphor by a traditional high-temperature solid-state reaction. The authors found that the doping of Sn4+ added a luminescence center to LMZ:0.02Bi3+ phosphor, and achieved coordinated blue-green emission with the change of the Sn4+ concentration, but its thermal stability was poor. Peipei Dang et al.144 designed two new type M10P6O25:Bi3+(M = Ca, Sr) phosphors. Due to the small Stokes displacement of the sample and the introduction of Bi3+ occupying the symmetrical site of the crystal, the structural rigidity of the sample is improved, and its thermal stability is also improved (Fig. 17).

Bismuth (Bi) has become an important dopant in the preparation of optical materials because of its strong interaction with the surrounding coordination environment and its rich valence states. Bi3+ produces ultraviolet, blue, green, yellow and even red emission according to the host and coordination environment. These optical properties also prove its great application potential and research value. However, the long wavelength emission of Bi3+ and the position of its excitation peak are generally located in the ultraviolet region, especially in the shorter wavelength region, which makes it unable to be well excited by n-UV and limits its further application. However, this disadvantage can be overcome by changing the doping host of Bi3+. For example, Sr2Zn2Ga2O7:Bi3+ has a strong excitation band in the n-UV region, while Bi3+-doped CaBaZn2Ga2O7 and SrBaZn2Ga2O7 phosphors are not well excited in the n-UV region. In addition, SrZnSO:Bi3+ also has a wide excitation band in the n-UV region, and coordinated light emission of cyan, yellow and white is achieved by co-doping a variety of activator ions. For M10P6O25:Bi3+ (M = Ca, Sr) phosphors, Bi3+ has a narrow emission peak and exhibits excellent thermal stability due to the highly compact rigid structure of the host. There are many doped hosts of Bi3+, and further research is needed on how to obtain phosphors with excellent comprehensive properties such as effective excitation in the n-UV region, narrow light emission peak and excellent thermal stability.
Due to the 1d2 → 3f4 transition of Tm3+, the inorganic compounds doped with Tm3+ show excellent blue emission under the excitation of near-ultraviolet light. Yang Li et al.145 prepared NaSrPO4:Tm3+ phosphor by solid-state sintering. The color purity of the prepared phosphor is as high as 95.0%, which is significantly higher than that of the traditional commercial blue (BAM) phosphor, and Tm3+ doping will not significantly change the crystal structure of NaSrPO4. Xiaoxue Huo et al.146 prepared Tb3+, Eu3+, and Tm3+ co-doped Mg2Y2Al2Si2O12(MYAS) phosphors. Different from single Tm3+ doping, the coordinated luminescence of blue–green–red colors can be realized by using the energy transfer between Tb3+–Eu3+ and Tm3+–Eu3+ in the Mg2Y2Al2Si2O12 host. Dy3+ is a good activator for white light emission, because it has strong 4F9/2 → 6H15/2 (blue light) and 4F9/2 → 6H15/2 (yellow light) energy level transitions.147,148 Harpreet Kaur et al.149 prepared Na2CaSiO4(NCS):Dy3+ phosphors by the sol–gel method. The emission intensity of the obtained phosphor at 423 K can also be maintained at 77.26% of that at room temperature. In addition, the authors also found that there is an electron interaction between Dy3+ to achieve energy transfer. To enhance blue light emission, co-doping Tm3+ is a common technical solution, because the 1d2 → 3f4 transition of Tm3+ ions can not only emit 455 nm blue light but also excite Dy3+ ions to realize effective energy transfer of Dy3+ ions.150,151 Yanzhen Yin et al.152 and Xin Wang et al.153 prepared Dy3+ and Tm3+ co-doping by high-temperature solid-state reaction, respectively, α-Sr2P2O7and YNbO4 phosphors. It is found that since the emission spectrum of Tm3+ overlaps with the excitation spectrum of Dy3+ in the band of 445–465 nm, Tm3+ can transfer energy to Dy3+ ions (Fig. 18), which can further improve the blue emission intensity of phosphors, indicating that the co-doping of the two ions can achieve high-quality blue emission (Table 6).

Among rare-earth elements and metal elements, Dy3+ and Tm3+ can both generate blue light emission. Tm3+ can effectively enhance the emission intensity of phosphors. Under the excitation of near ultraviolet light, Dy3+ can also generate blue and yellow emissions. By controlling the energy transfer between Tm3+ and Dy3+, the coordinated emission of light from blue to yellow can be realized, and white light can be directly obtained. In addition, Tm3+ can also be co-doped with Tb3+ and Eu3+ in a suitable host to achieve white light emission.
4. Conclusions and perspective
With the progress of science and technology, white light-emitting diodes have gradually replaced traditional incandescent and fluorescent lamps because of their excellent luminous performance and the characteristics of energy conservation and environmental protection. However, the traditional method of combining red, green, and blue LED chips to obtain white light not only has a high manufacturing cost and affects commercial value but also has a large chromatic aberration. According to relevant reports, light with different color temperatures will stimulate retinal cells and enable the brain to make corresponding instructions. There is no doubt that this will have an impact on the secretion of hormones in the human body, as well as on the human biological clock and physical health. The color rendering index refers to the size of the visual perception ability of the light source to restore the object under the natural sunlight. The higher the color rendering index, the easier it is for people to distinguish various colors of the object. In addition, the difference brought by the size of the color rendering index is not only the difference in human vision. It is reported that the optometry community has repeatedly confirmed that natural light can prevent human myopia, so the LED lamp with a high color rendering index can protect human vision. Nowadays, people's requirements for general lighting have shifted to comfort and health, which puts forward higher requirements for the color rendering index (CRI) and color temperature (CCT) of WLED. Therefore, it is particularly important to realize full visible spectrum lighting, fill the cyan gap, and develop cyan and blue phosphors. In this review, we focus on the development of new rare-earth activated cyan and blue phosphors and systematically introduce the spectrum of rare-earth ions, the difference in energy transfer mechanism and transfer efficiency, as well as some applications of phosphors. We divide these phosphors into different types, such as aluminate, silicate, borate, and phosphate. After that, according to the different activators, we found that Ce3+, Eu2+ and Eu3+ were the main activator ions. The luminescence characteristics of Ce3+, Eu2+, and Eu3+ in different hosts also help to find phosphors for the production of full-spectrum LEDs.
Cyan and blue phosphors mostly emit light by making use of the transition between the energy levels of rare-earth ions (Eu2+, Ce3+). The energy levels of Eu2+ and Ce3+ are almost unchanged, or the environment has little influence on them. This shows that the color of its emitted light is relatively stable. For phosphors prepared with different host materials doped with Eu2+ and Ce3+, their luminous intensity and quenching energy levels differ. In addition, its fluorescence emission spectrum is also different from the fluorescence emission spectrum formed by other doped ions, with a large Stokes shift. Due to its special energy level structure, the emission peak of the emission spectrum is relatively wide, and the luminous color purity is not high. For cyan and blue phosphors formed by other ions, most of the emission peaks of their emission spectra are relatively narrow and their color purity is high, but their luminous properties are also greatly affected by the crystal environment. In addition, the cost of phosphors made of other non-rare-earth ions is relatively low.
Although some cyan and blue phosphors can be prepared now, these phosphors have the disadvantages of poor thermal stability, low emission intensity, narrow excitation wavelength range, low color purity, single preparation method, and low repeatability, which limit the illumination of the full visible spectrum. Looking forward, further research is needed to improve the luminescence performance of phosphors and the preparation of phosphors in the future. We put forward the following ideas:
(1) The emission wavelength of cyan is 480–520 nm; therefore, to develop cyan phosphors with high color purity, elements with narrow-band emission must be selected, and the emission wavelength should be within the range of the cyan emission wavelength. As we all know, it is difficult to explore new elements matching cyan narrow-band emission. Through the doping of multiple elements, the color migration of phosphors can be realized, so that phosphors can finally show that cyan emission, which is a simple strategy. However, there are some problems, such as the energy transfer mechanism between ions, the energy transfer efficiency, and the different energy transfer modes between ions in different matrices; further systematic research is needed. Only after fully understanding the interaction mechanism between ions in different hosts, can we prepare target phosphors with good luminescence performance more efficiently.
(2) Stability of phosphor: chemical, physical and thermal stabilities are important properties of phosphors. For cyan and blue phosphors, higher requirements are put forward for their physical and chemical stability, because most of their activator ions are low valence ions, and long-term storage capacity is prone to oxidation, which will quench the cyan and blue luminous intensity. The surface modification of phosphor can not only improve its thermal stability, but also enhance its chemical and physical stability, effectively preventing the oxidant reaction of activator ions. A layer of material is coated on the surface of the fluorescent powder particles, after the coating is completed, a material with the fluorescent powder as the core and the coating layer as the shell is formed. Common materials used for coating are carbon, inorganic oxides (SiO2 and Al2O3), and some organic compounds. The coated material and coating process need further development.
(3) Selection of phosphor hosts: The luminescence performance of phosphor is affected by many factors, and the crystal structure will also affect the luminescence of phosphor. If a cyan phosphor is to be prepared, due to the narrow range of cyan emission wavelength, the host with a compact crystal structure shall be selected for doping. For the preparation of a blue phosphor, the “red shift” phenomenon shall be avoided when selecting the host. A systematic study of the correlation between matrix structure and properties will undoubtedly make it easier for us to prepare new phosphors. Therefore, if we put forward some principles as a guide, and use of the model structure of existing minerals, or finding some mineral crystals with a similar structure, to design new phosphors, will promote the improvement and development of new cyan and blue phosphors.
