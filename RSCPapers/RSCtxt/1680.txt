Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have been drawing much attention as one of the most powerful devices for converting solar energy directly to electric power.1–3 As an important component in DSSCs, the counter electrode (CE) plays a critical role in improving and maintaining the photovoltaic performance of DSSCs by electrocatalyzing the reduction of I3− to I− ions.4 Until now, platinum (Pt) is still the most useful CE material due to its outstanding electrocatalytic activity and excellent conductivity. However, Pt is rare, expensive and easily corroded by I−/I3− redox couples by forming PtI4 and H2PtI6 by-products,5 which inevitably hinders the large-scale fabrication of DSSCs. In the past few years, conductive organic polymers,6,7 carbon materials,8,9 and various inorganic compounds (such as sulfide,10–13 selenides,14–17 carbides18 and oxides19,20) have been extensively explored to replace the expensive Pt in DSSCs. Particularly, metal chalcogenides have been demonstrated to be promising CE materials due to their low-cost, easy preparation, good electrocatalytic ability and chemical stability. For example, DSSCs with CoS as the CE material displayed a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 6.50% under AM1.5G illumination, comparable to that of the Pt-based device.21 The graphene-like Co0.85Se CE prepared by Wang's group exhibited excellent electrocatalytic activity and stability for the reduction of I3−, and considerably exceeded Pt in the final PCE.14 These promising results inspired extensive studies on developing new metal sulfides/selenides for seeking cost-effective CE materials.
Although great success has been achieved for chalcogenide CEs, there are still some problems limiting their practical applications in DSSCs. For instance, the relatively low conductivity of chalcogenides always leads to high series resistance, which is harmful for electron collection and transport.22 Additionally, the low surface-to-volume ratio of chalcogenide CEs usually results in unsatisfactory charger-transfer ability and electrocatalytic activity. Therefore, it is imperative to improve the electrochemical performance of chalcogenide CEs through tailoring their structure and composition for their further applications. Recently, heterostructured electrocatalysts with multiple active components have displayed excellent electrocatalytic activity for the generation of I3− ions compared to their single-component counterpart, associated with either the well-exposed active sites or the optimized electronic configuration on the interfaces. For example, the DSSCs with CuInS2–ZnS heteronanorods23 and NiS–Ni2S3 nanorod arrays24 manifest a superior efficiency of 7.50% and 7.20%, yielding 15.4% and 15.6% enhancements as compared to CuInS2 and Ni2S3 CEs, respectively. Similarly, our recent work shows that DSSCs with Ag–Ag8SnS6 heterodimers25 and Ni3S4–PtX (X = Fe, Ni) hetero-oligomers26 exhibited much better electrocatalytic activity than that of the single component of metal and sulfides due to the existence of Mott–Schottky heterojunctions in the hybrids. This is because the formed Mott–Schottky heterojunctions render an inner electric field at their interfaces, leading to the accumulation of electrons on metal domains and subsequently accelerating the catalytic reactions. Despite these advantages, the one-step controlled synthesis of well-defined heterostructures for chalcogenides by a facile method is still challengeable due to their dissimilar growth processes involved with different microscopic mechanisms and reaction rates.
Recently, Prussian blue analogues (PBA) are demonstrated to be excellent precursors for synthesizing functional materials with excellent electrocatalytic and energy storage performances.27–30 Additionally, nitrogen-doped carbon, which often exhibits superior performance in electro-catalysis, can be easily produced by using dopamine (PDA) as a precursor. Therefore, the combination of Prussian blue analogues and PDA would be an efficient method to prepare high-quantity chalcogenide/N-doped carbon CE catalysts with delicately controlled morphology and composition, which not only overcome the low conductivity of chalcogenides but also improve their catalytic activity due to the synergistic effect of different components. Herein, we report the controlled synthesis of CoS2–CoSe2 heterostructured nanocrystals encapsulated in N-doped carbon hollow nanocubes (CoS2–CoSe2@NC) through simultaneous sulfurization and selenization of Co3[Co(CN)6]2 PBA@dopamine (CoCo PBA@PDA) core–shell nanocubes. When employed as CE catalysts in DSSCs, the resulting CoS2–CoSe2@NC nanocubes exhibit excellent electrocatalytic activity and cycling stability toward the generation of I3− ions. A typical DSSC achieves a high power conversion efficiency of 8.47% under AM1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2), superior to those with CoS2@NC (7.38%), CoSe2@NC (7.85%) and Pt (8.08%). These results demonstrate that the CoS2–CoSe2@NC nanocubes are promising alternatives to Pt in DSSCs.
Experimental
Synthesis of CoCo PBA nanocubes
The CoCo PBA nanocubes were synthesized as noted in a previous report with some modifications.31 Briefly, 3.0 mmol of Co(NO3)2·6H2O and 4.5 mmol of Na3C6H5O7·2H2O were dissolved in 100 mL of deionized water under vigorous stirring to form a clear solution. This dark-red solution was then rapidly injected into 100 mL of aqueous solution containing 2.0 mmol of K3[Co(CN)6]. The obtained mixed solution was allowed to age for 24 h at room temperature. Finally, the product was collected by centrifugation and washed with water and ethanol three times, and dried at 80 °C in a vacuum oven for 12 h.
Synthesis of CoCo PBA@PDA core–shell nanocubes
In a typical synthesis of CoCo PBA@PDA core–shell nanocubes, 80 mg of CoCo PBA nanocubes and 40 mg dopamine (PDA) were dispersed in 10 mM Tris buffer solution (pH = 8.5, 100 mL) and stirred for 3 h at room temperature. The resultant product was then collected by centrifugation and further washed several times with water and ethanol, respectively. The final product was dried under vacuum at 60 °C for 12 h.
Synthesis of CoS2–CoSe2@NC nanocubes
In a typical procedure, 30 mg of the as-prepared CoCo PBA@PDA core–shell nanocubes were placed at the downstream side of an alumina boat, and 240 mg of the mixed sulphur and selenium powder with a mass ratio of 1:1 was placed at the upstream side of the boat. After that, the boat was moved to the middle of the heating zone of a slender quartz tube for heat treatment with 100 sccm N2 gas. The furnace was heated to 350 °C at a heating rate of 1 °C min−1 from room temperature, and was maintained at this temperature for 2 h. After being naturally cooled to room temperature, CoS2–CoSe2@NC nanocubes were obtained. For comparison, the CoSe2@NC and CoS2@NC nanocubes were synthesized by a similar procedure as mentioned above.
Preparation of counter electrodes
The CEs were prepared by a facile drop-casting method following Wang's procedure.32 In brief, 1.0 g catalyst was dispersed in 10.0 mL of isopropanol by ultrasonication for 30 min to form a homogeneous solution. The above solution was then drop-cast onto a cleaned FTO glass substrate, which was masked by a 3 M Scotch tape with an exposed area of 0.5 cm × 0.5 cm. The loading amount of the CE catalyst was adjusted by the drop volume of the solution from 50 to 200 μL. Finally, the films were dried in an oven at 60 °C for 30 min. For comparison, the pyrolytic Pt CE was prepared by drop-casting 50 μL of H2PtCl6 in ethanol (5 mM) on a 1.5 × 1.5 cm2 FTO glass followed by sintering at 400 °C for 30 min.
Fabrication of DSSCs
DSSCs were fabricated by assembling the N719-sensitized TiO2 photoanodes (Ying kou Opvtech New Energy Co., Ltd) and CEs with a hot-melt film as a spacer (Surlyn 1702; DuPont, 60 μm in thickness). The cell internal space was filled with an electrolyte using a vacuum pump followed by a sealing procedure with a Surlyn film and a cover glass under heating. The liquid electrolyte was composed of 0.60 M 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide, 0.03 M I2, 0.50 M 4-tert-butyl pyridine, 0.06 M lithium iodide and 0.10 M guanidinium thiocyanate of anhydrous acetonitrile. The sealed DSSCs were used for the photocurrent–voltage test with an active area of 0.16 cm2.
Characterization
The phase and crystal structure of the as-obtained products were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (Shimadzu XRD-6000) with Cu Kα radiation. The morphologies and the crystal lattice of the samples were characterized by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, JEOL, JSM-6700F) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, JEOL, JEM-2100F), respectively. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was performed on a VG Scientific ESCLAB 220iXL X-ray photoelectron spectrometer with Al Kα (1486.6 eV) as the X-ray source. The surface area and porosity of the materials were analyzed by using a NOVA 2200e instrument. The photocurrent–voltage tests of DSSCs were performed under AM 1.5 illumination (100 mW cm−2) under ambient conditions on a 94023A Oriel sol3A solar simulator (Newport) with a 450 W xenon lamp as a light source. Cyclic voltammetry was conducted in a three-electrode system in an acetonitrile solution of 0.1 M LiClO4, 10 mM LiI and 1 mM I2 at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1, where a platinum net electrode served as a CE and the Ag/AgCl couple was used as a reference electrode. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy experiments were performed and Tafel-polarization curves were measured with dummy cells in the dark by using a Zahner electrochemical workstation (Zahner Zennium CIMPS-1, Germany). The frequency range of EIS experiments was from 100 mHz to 1 MHz with an AC modulation signal of 10 mV and a bias DC voltage of 0 V. The resultant impedance spectra were analyzed via the Z-view software. Tafel-polarization measurements were carried out at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1.
Results and discussion
The synthetic route and model of CoS2–CoSe2@NC nanocubes are schematically illustrated, as shown in Fig. 1. The CoCo PBA nanocubes are firstly synthesized through a facile co-precipitation procedure at room temperature. The resultant CoCo PBA nanocubes are then coated with polydopamine (PDA) to prepare CoCo PBA@PDA core–shell nanocubes through an oxidization and cyclization reaction. Finally, a facile chemical vapor deposition method is employed to transform the as-prepared CoCo PBA@PDA core–shell nanocubes into CoS2–CoSe2@NC nanocubes through simultaneous sulfurization and selenization reactions.
 Fig. 1  Schematic illustration for the synthesis of CoS2@CoSe2@NC nanocubes. 
The field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) image shows that the as-prepared CoCo PBA nanocubes present a highly uniform structure with an average size of 962 nm (Fig. 2a), and the corresponding transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image indicates that these PBA nanocubes have a solid and dense texture (Fig. 2b). The power X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) pattern is shown in Fig. S1.† All of the diffraction peaks can be well indexed to Co3[Co(CN)6]2 (JCPDS no. 77-1161, a = b = c = 10.2 Å), indicating the high purity of the sample. The CoCo PBA nanocubes are then used as matrices to fabricate CoCo PBA@PDA core–shell nanocubes by immersing the CoCo PBA nanocubes in a Tris buffer solution. As shown in Fig. 2c, the CoCo PBA@PDA nanocubes are brown and exhibit a similar cube-like structure to that of CoCo PBA, except a more coarse surface. The TEM image in Fig. 2d shows that the CoCo PBA nanocube surface is covered by a continuous polymer layer, which means that the PDA layer has successfully attached onto the surface of CoCo PBA nanocubes by forming core–shell nanocubes.33,34

CoS2–CoSe2@NC nanocubes are fabricated via simultaneous sulfuration and selenization of CoCo PBA@PDA core–shell nanocubes at 350 °C for 2 h. The XRD investigation clearly identifies the achievement of the CoS2–CoSe2 hybrid in the final product, in which the crystallographic phase of CoS2 (JCPDS no. 41-1471, a = b = c = 5.537 Å) and CoSe2 (JCPDS no. 53-0449, a = 4.850 Å, b = 5.827 Å, c = 3.628 Å) is observed (Fig. S2†). These results indicate that the metal atom of Co in the PBA nanocubes is transformed into CoS2 and CoSe2. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is performed to analyze the valence state and confirm the surface composition of the sample. In the survey spectrum of the hybrids, the primary chemical compositions of C, N, Co, S and Se can be determined (Fig. 3a). The C 1s spectrum exhibits two peaks centered at 284.77 and 286.25 eV, which can be attributed to the C–C and C–N bonds, respectively (Fig. 3b).34 For the N 1s spectrum, the binding energies at 398.85, 400.02, and 398.85 eV are consistent with the pyridinic, pyrrolic and graphitic N, respectively (Fig. 3c).35 The strong peaks at the binding energies of 780.17 and 796.29 eV are attributed to 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 of Co2+ species, while the peaks at 778.54 and 793.59 eV correspond to 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 of Co3+ species, respectively (Fig. 3d). The existence of Co3+ indicates the slight surface oxidation state of the sample, which is consistent with previous reports.36 The peaks of Se 3d5/2 (Se 3d3/2) and S 2p3/2 (S 2p1/2) are located at 54.64 eV (55.43 eV) and 162.51 eV (163.64 eV), respectively.37 Similarly, the minor peaks near 163.6 eV and 59.09 eV suggest the presence of higher oxidation-state sulfide and selenide species in the sample (Fig. 3e and f).38,39

The morphology details of the hybrids are then investigated by SEM and TEM. As one can see in Fig. 4a, the as-prepared CoS2–CoSe2@NC, CoSe2@NC and CoS2@NC nanocubes preserve the uniform cube-like morphology of the CoCo PBA nanocubes after the conversion process. A typical TEM image indicates that the as-obtained CoS2–CoSe2@NC nanocubes present an obvious porous structure, and plenty of CoS2 and CoSe2 nanocrystals are uniformly dispersed in the carbon matrix. The lattice fringes are clearly presented in a high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image. The interplanar spacings of 0.249, 0.243 and 0.247 nm can be ascribed to the (120), (200) and (210) planes of CoSe2 and CoS2, respectively. The intimate contact between CoS2 and CoSe2 suggests the formation of heterojunctions in the hybrids. The element mapping shown in Fig. 4g reveals that the elements C, N, Co, S and Se are uniformly distributed over the whole nanocubes, which confirms the formation of CoS2–CoSe2@NC nanocubes. Based on the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method, the CoS2–CoSe2@NC nanocubes possessed a surface area of 28.37 m2 g−1 with a narrow pore size distribution centred at 6.0 nm, exhibiting an obvious mesoporous structure (Fig. S3†). Apparently, the high surface area and porosity are beneficial for mass transport and diffusion of the electrolyte during the electrocatalysis process, which is expected to show excellent electrochemical performance in DSSCs.

Sandwich-structure devices are assembled to assess the potential application of the as-prepared hybrid CEs in DSSCs. Further study indicates that the performance of DSSCs strongly depends on the loading amount of the CE catalyst (Fig. S4 and Table S1†). The current density–voltage (J–V) curves, when the drop volume was 100 μL, are shown in Fig. 5a and the related photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. The DSSC using the CoS2–CoSe2@NC CE produces an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.740 V, a short circuit current density (Jsc) of 16.35 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.70, thus resulting in an overall PCE of 8.45%. An improved photovoltaic performance compared to that of the devices employing CoSe2@NC nanocubes is observed (Voc = 0.742 V, Jsc = 15.26 mA cm−2, FF = 0.69, η = 7.83%), CoS2@NC nanocubes (Voc = 0.738 V, Jsc = 14.73 mA cm−2, FF = 0.68, η = 7.39%), and Pt (Voc = 0.749 V, Jsc = 15.53 mA cm−2, FF = 0.69, η = 8.07%) as the CE. The higher PCE for the CoS2–CoSe2@NC CE is mainly contributed by the improvement of Jsc and FF due to the similar Voc. The larger Jsc can be attributed to its better electrocatalytic activity toward the reduction of I3−, which accelerates the regeneration of N719 dye molecules and facilitates the photogenerated electrons’ flow from the dye molecules to the conduction band of TiO2.40 However, the improvement of FF is mainly due to the reduced series resistance, charge-transfer resistance at the CE/electrolyte interface and the diffusion resistance of I3− in the electrolyte. Additionally, pure CoS2 and CoSe2 CEs were prepared by direct sulfurization and selenization of CoCo PBA nanocubes and their catalytic behaviours were also evaluated. It was found that their photovoltaic performance is significantly inferior to that of CoS2@NC, CoSe2@NC, CoS2–CoSe2@NC and Pt CEs, which indicates that the N-doped carbon coating is helpful for the improvement of catalytic activity (Fig. S5 and Table S2†).

To investigate the electrocatalytic activities of the as-prepared CEs toward the reduction of I3− ions, cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements are carried out in a three-electrode system. As shown in Fig. 5b, each CV curve gives rise to two typical pairs of oxidation–reduction peaks, suggesting that the CoS2 and CoSe2 CEs can exhibit Pt-like electrocatalytic behaviour. The left peak in a low potential range corresponds to the oxidation (Ox-1) and reduction (Red-1) of I−/I3−, and the right one can be assigned to the oxidation (Ox-2) and reduction (Red-2) of I2/I3−.41 The peak current density of Red-1 and peak-to-peak separation (Epp) between Red-1 and Ox-1 are the two important parameters for comparing the catalytic activities of different CEs. The CoS2–CoSe2@NC CE produces a higher peak current density (2.37 mA cm−2) than that of CoSe2@NC (2.09 mA cm−2), CoS2@NC (1.76 mA cm−2) and Pt CEs (2.17 mA cm−2), indicating that it has better electrocatalytic activity for the reduction of I3− ions.42 Additionally, the Epp of CoS2–CoSe2@NC CE (319 mV) is also smaller than those of CoSe2@NC (391 mV), CoS2@NC (436 mV) and Pt CEs (360 mV), suggesting a smaller overpotential for the reduction reaction on the CoS2–CoSe2@NC CE.32 The highest peak current density and the lowest Epp value indicate that the CoS2–NCoSe2@NC CE presents the best catalytic activity for the reduction of I3− to I− among the four CEs. The stacking CV plots of the CoS2–CoSe2@NC CE are recorded at different scanning rates to extract the relationship between the scanning rate and the peak current density of Ox-1/Red-1 (Fig. S6†). A good linear relationship is found between the peak current density and the square root of the scanning rate, indicating that both the cathodic and anodic reactions are diffusion limited by the transportation of iodide species toward the CE in DSSCs.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements are performed to investigate the charge transfer kinetics and internal resistance at the CE/electrolyte interface. The Nyquist plots with symmetrical cells (CE/electrolyte/CE) are shown in Fig. 5c and Fig. S7.† The values of Rs (series resistance), Rct (charge-transfer resistance), double-layer capacitance (Cμ) and ZN (Nernst diffusion impedance) are obtained by fitting the Nyquist plots with the software of Zview, and are summarized in Table 1 and Table S3.† All CEs produce similar Rs values, hence posing a similar influence on the photovoltaic performances. The simulated Rct value of the CoS2–CoSe2@NC CE is 0.38 Ω cm2, smaller than those of CoSe2@NC (0.51 Ω cm2), CoS2@NC (0.59 Ω cm2) and Pt CEs (0.45 Ω cm2). The smaller Rct suggests that the CoS2–CoSe2@NC CE has better electrocatalytic activity toward the reduction of I3− than the others. A constant phase element (CPE = (CPE-T)−1(jw)−(CPE-P)) is used as a substitute for a capacitor to fit the impedance behaviour of the electrical double layer in DSSCs.43 A larger CPE-T means an increase in the active surface area, and a decrease of CPE-P implies an increase in the porosity.44 The CoS2–CoSe2@NC CE has a higher CPE-T (269.14 μF cm−2) compared to those of CoSe2@NC (220.52 μF cm−2), CoS2@NC (217.94 μF cm−2) and Pt (112.62 μF cm−2) CEs, demonstrating its larger contact surface area between the CE and the electrolyte. In addition, the ZN value for the symmetric cells increases by a sequence of CoS2–CoSe2@NC (0.54 Ω cm2) < Pt (0.83 Ω cm2) < CoSe2@NC (1.10 Ω cm2) < CoS2@NC (1.18 Ω cm2), revealing a faster diffusion velocity of the redox species in the electrolyte for the CoS2–CoSe2@NC CE. These results imply that the as-prepared CoS2–CoSe2@NC CE produces lower charge-transfer resistance at the CE/electrolyte interface, which causes the increase in the fill factor of the DSSCs and the improvement of photovoltaic performance.
To further examine the interfacial charge-transfer behaviours of the I3−/I− couple on the CE surface, Tafel polarization measurements are carried out on the symmetric cells used in the EIS experiments. In the Tafel zone, the exchange current density (J0) can be obtained by the intersection of the cathodic branch and the equilibrium potential line. As shown in Fig. 5d, the slope of a tangent for the CoS2–CoSe2@NC CE is slightly higher than that of CoSe2@NC, CoS2@NC and Pt CEs, implying that the CoS2–CoSe2@NC CE has larger J0 and better catalytic activity. The J0 value can also be calculated from the formula:45J0 = RT/nFRct, where R is the gas constant, T is the absolute temperature, F is Faraday's constant and Rct is the charge transfer resistance obtained from the EIS plots. The order of the calculated Rct values is CoS2@NC > CoSe2@NC > Pt > CoS2–CoSe2@NC, which is consistent with the results from the EIS analysis. In the diffusion zone, the intersection of the cathodic branch with the y-axis can be regarded as limited current density (Jlim), a parameter depending on the diffusion coefficient (Dn) of the redox couple in the electrolyte. The larger intersection of the cathodic branch with the y-axis means that the CoS2–CoSe2@NC CE has higher limited current density (Jlim) and higher diffusion velocity.
The electrochemical stability of CEs is an important factor affecting the potential applications of DSSCs. To evaluate the stability of CoS2–CoSe2@NC nanocubes in the iodine electrolyte, the CoS2–CoSe2@NC CE is subjected to sequential CV scanning for 100 cycles in 10 mM LiI, 1 mm I2, and 0.1 mM LiClO4 acetonitrile solution at a scanning rate of 50 mV s−1. One can see that the current density and the Epp value of CoS2–CoSe2@NC CEs have nearly no change after 100 cycles. However, the reduction peak current density decreased and the Epp increased noticeably for the Pt CE (Fig. 6a and b). This comparison demonstrates that the CoS2–CoSe2@NC CE has better corrosion resistance to the iodine electrolyte than the Pt CE.46 In order to cross-check the stability, the two symmetrical cells containing the CoS2–CoSe2@NC and Pt electrodes are then subjected to sequential EIS scanning for 10 cycles. Almost no changes in Rs and ZN for the two cells are observed, implying that the potential cycling exerts trivial influence on the series resistance and the mass transport in the redox electrolyte solution.14 The Rct for the Pt CE increases from 1.26 Ω cm2 in the first cycle to 1.61 Ω cm2 in the final cycle, but the Rct increases from 0.64 Ω cm2 to 0.76 Ω cm2 for the CoS2–CoSe2@NC CE (Fig. 6c and d). On the basis of the above investigations, we can make a conclusion that the CoS2–CoSe2@NC CE has better electrochemical stability than that of the Pt CE in the I3−/I− electrolyte system.
 Fig. 6  100 consecutive CVs of (a) Pt and (b) CoS2–CoSe2@NC CEs were recorded in the I−/I3− system at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. Nyquist plots of EIS data for the symmetrical cells with (c) Pt and (d) CoS2–CoSe2@NC electrodes. The cells were first subjected to CV scanning from 0 to 1 V and then from −1 to 0 V at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1, followed by 30 s relaxation at 0 V. 
Taking the electrochemical characterization results together, including PCE, CV, EIS and Tafel polarization, the as-synthesized CoS2–CoSe2@NC nanocubes indeed exhibit excellent electrocatalytic activity and stability toward the regeneration of I3− ions in DSSCs. To further study the advantage of the CoS2–CoSe2@NC nanocubes in catalyzing the reduction of I3− ions, the work functions of CoS2 and CoSe2 are calculated to analyze the electronic behaviours of the sample (Fig. S8†). The CoS2 (001) surface and the CoSe2 (100) surface are chosen to create slab modules for the calculation due to their lowest surface energy.47,48 The work functions of CoS2 and CoSe2 are then determined to be 4.73 and 4.82 eV, respectively. Due to the higher work function of CoSe2, electrons will transfer from CoS2 to CoSe2 to equilibrate the Fermi levels when they form a contact.49,50 As a result, the CoS2 is positively charged and the CoSe2 becomes negatively charged near the heterojunction interface due to the formed electric field.48 In this regard, the accumulated electrons in CoSe2 will cause the adsorption of I3− ions from the electrolyte,51 which subsequently accelerates the reduction of I3− ions in DSSCs. Therefore, the CoS2–CoSe2@NC CE displays lower charge-transfer resistance, faster reaction kinetics and better photovoltaic performance than CoSe2@NC and CoS2@NC CEs.
On the basis of the above analysis, the as-synthesized CoS2–CoSe2@NC hybrid exhibits excellent catalytic activity toward the regeneration of I3− redox couples due to its unique hybrid structure and composite features. First, the existence of heterojunctions between CoS2 and CoSe2 renders an enhanced inner electric field at their interfaces, which improves the electron transfer over the whole electrochemical reactions and thus accelerates the catalytic reactions. Second, the conductive carbon coating increases the electrical conductivity of the electrode materials, which causes the increase in the fill factor and the performance of the DSSCs. Third, the porous nanocubes improve the contact between the electrolyte and CE materials by providing superior electrochemical kinetics and stability.
Conclusions
In conclusion, uniform and well-defined CoS2–CoSe2@NC nanocubes are successfully prepared through simultaneous sulfurization and selenization reactions by using CoCo PBA@PDA core–shell nanocubes as templates. The synergistic integration fully exploits the benefits of both structural and compositional characteristics of the hybrid, i.e., the synergistic effects of CoS2 and CoSe2 heterojunctions, the conductive N-doped carbon coating and the porous structure of the hybrids, endowing the resultant CoS2–CoSe2@NC nanocubes with excellent catalytic activity and stability for the reduction of I3− ions in DSSCs. A typical DSSC using CoS2–CoSe2@NC nanocubes shows an impressive PCE of 8.45% under AM1.5G illumination, which is superior to the pristine Pt CE under the same conditions. The study presented here is far from being fully optimized, but provides a promising strategy to design and synthesize other novel metal sulfide/selenide hybrid materials for applications in the fields of energy conversion and storage.
