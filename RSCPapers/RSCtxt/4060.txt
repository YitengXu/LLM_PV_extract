    , Accepted 20th August 2019First published on 21st August 2019AbstractTwo-dimensional (2D) semiconductors have aroused tremendous interest due to their potential to revolutionize the electronics industry and illustrate fundamental quantum physics related to electronics and optics. Any practical applications of 2D semiconductors rely on the production of high-quality 2D materials on a wafer scale. Solution-processed approaches for the attainment of 2D semiconductors and uniform thin films have potential to overcome the challenges of high energy cost and rigorous growth control in vapor-based synthesis approaches. In addition, they also allow low-temperature deposition, and therefore are the driving forces for the advancement of flexible electronics. In particular, the availability of high-quality solution-processed monolayer or few-layer 2D metal chalcogenides and 2D elements ushers in new developments in the field of electronics. The individual 2D semiconductors or their thin film assemblies are potential candidates for proof-of-concept or large-scale device applications. In this review, we describe the categories of 2D semiconductors, and summarize their solution-based synthesis and assembly approaches, and their device applications in field-effect transistors, photodetectors and memristors. In the end, insights and perspectives on the future development of this field are discussed.

1. Introduction
Two-dimensional (2D) materials have attracted considerable research interest due to their unique structures and novel physical properties.1–4 Although graphene, the first studied monolayer 2D material, exhibits ultrahigh carrier mobility at room temperature, its zero bandgap limits its electronic applications.5,6 Therefore, there is much impetus to search for 2D materials with tunable bandgaps, which have potential applications in electronic and optoelectronic devices, and possess interesting physics at the low dimensional limit.1,7–9 These 2D semiconductors can be obtained by mechanical exfoliation with the assistance of Scotch tape, but the obtained products usually have richly varied thickness on scattered areas of a silicon wafer, and hence one has to rely on multiple transferring steps, complicated alignment, and electron-beam lithography to fabricate a complete device, which limits their use for scaled-up production of electronic devices.10–12 Alternatively, 2D semiconductors can be grown by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) on suitable substrates, and have shown optimized properties of high crystalline quality, scalable dimensions, tunable thickness, and excellent electronic performance.13–17 Despite these merits, CVD is expensive and energy-intensive, usually requiring high temperature and high vacuum conditions.18 In addition, it takes extra effort to exfoliate and transfer the CVD grown 2D semiconductors from pristine substrates to targeted substrates to fabricate heterojunctions or flexible devices.19–21 Other than mechanical exfoliation and CVD, solution-based synthesis has recently emerged as a promising technique to economically produce 2D semiconductors with high electronic grade, and allows solution-based assembly methods to fabricate thin films, patterns and heterostructures on any substrates.7,22–26
Historically, assembling high-performance semiconducting thin films from solution-produced nanomaterials is very challenging, as there is a considerable energy penalty for the charge carriers to hop or tunnel through different nanodomains without being captured by the various defects along the way. It was once considered impossible for zero-dimensional quantum dots to form high-mobility semiconducting films due to their large contact interfaces induced by their small size (<20 nm). However, the attainment of highly dispersed quantum dots with uniform size in the past few years has enabled the preparation of their thin films with short or long-range order using appropriate assembly methods.23 By surface ligand exchange, the distance between quantum dots can be shortened, and the electron wave functions between them can overlap and interact with each other, forming a strongly coupled aggregate.27–32 With these advancements, the thin films of quantum dots can have a higher carrier mobility up to 400 cm2 V−1 s−1.27–32 Beyond the zero-dimensional materials, one-dimensional nanomaterials, such as single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), have also been used to prepare semiconducting thin films. The semiconducting SWCNTs are coupled to each other at the contact point by van der Waals force, which facilitates the transport of charge carriers. The carrier mobility of random SWCNT networks is up to 70 cm2 V−1 s−1 with appropriate metal electrodes, dielectric materials and preparation processes.33–36 In addition, SWCNTs can be properly oriented, further improving the mobility of the semiconducting thin films.37,38 All these discoveries point out the necessity of high-quality nanomaterials, facilitated charge transfer at the interfaces, and proper assembly methods for engineering high-performance semiconducting thin films.39
Solution-processed 2D semiconductors have also experienced much research effort before their importance in electronic devices was recognized. Facilitated by the improvement of synthetic approaches for high crystalline 2D semiconductors with few defects in the past few years, their thin films have been assembled with controllable thickness, desirable electrical properties, and excellent flexibility with promising applications in high-performance electronic devices.7,40,41 In this review, we would like to summarize the recent progress in the synthesis, assembly, and electronic applications of solution-processed 2D semiconductors, considering few reviews have entirely concentrated on this topic.42,43
The following discussion comprises four parts. Section 2 briefly presents the categories and characteristics of 2D semiconductors. Section 3 summarizes the solution-based synthesis of 2D semiconductors and analyzes the features of each method. Section 4 demarcates the assembly methods for producing and patterning the thin films from solution-processed 2D semiconductors. Section 5 expounds the electronic applications of solution-processed 2D semiconductors, including field-effect transistors (FETs), photodetectors and memristors. Finally, we conclude with an outlook on the challenges and opportunities in this field.
2. Categories of 2D semiconductors
2D materials are generally layered crystalline solids with strong covalent bonds within the layers, and are usually connected by weak van der Waals forces.4 In this family, 2D semiconductors have finite bandgaps, and materials with bandgaps larger than 5 eV are considered as insulators (e.g., boron nitride).44 In this review, we mainly focus on three groups of 2D semiconductors, namely, transition metal chalcogenides (TMCs), main group metal chalcogenides (MGMEs), and main group elements (MGEs), which have shown promising applications in solution-processed electronic devices (Fig. 1a).

TMCs consist of elements of transition metals (TM) and chalcogens (X), and can be either dichalcogenides (TMX2) or trichalcogenides (TMX3) depending on the valence electrons of these d-block metals.45–55TMX2 is the archetypical stoichiometric composition. A representative example is MoS2, which might be the most studied 2D material excluding graphene. In addition to TMX2, group IVB and VB metals, such as HfSe2 and HfSe3, can form TMX3.56,57 These inorganic compounds can have different phases even with the same compositions. For example, each layer in TMX2 consists of one atomic layer of TM atoms sandwiched between two atomic layers of X atoms. Depending on the coordination environment of TM with X atoms, the structure has a variety of phases. In MoS2, the 2H phase (strictly 1H phase if it is a monolayer) has a trigonal prism geometry with hexagonal symmetry, while the 1T phase has an octahedral configuration with tetragonal symmetry (Fig. 1b).58 Other less symmetric phases are possible, such as the 1T′ phase for the distorted octahedral configuration, and the 3R phase for a rhombohedral lattice with three monolayers along the c-axis in a repeating unit (Fig. 1b).59 The electronic properties are phase-dependent: the 2H and 3R MoS2 are semiconducting, while the 1T and 1T′ MoS2 are metallic (Fig. 1b). The metallic 1T or 1T′ phases are metastable and can be converted to the semiconducting 2H phase via laser irradiation and thermal treatment.60,61 Other than phases, the layer number also affects the band structures of TMCs. The monolayer 2D semiconductors (e.g., MoS2 (1.8 eV), MoSe2 (1.5 eV), MoTe2 (1.1 eV), WS2 (2.1 eV), and WSe2 (1.7 eV)) show direct bandgaps, whereas their bulk phases exhibit smaller indirect bandgaps.44,62–65 The different combinations and control of materials, phases, and number of layers lead to a wide collection of bandgaps (Table 1), which should be very useful for particular electronic applications.66 In addition, the solution chemistry induced phase conversion makes it easy for device optimization. For example, the 1T MoS2, despite being metallic in nature, is effective in reducing the contact resistance for 2H MoS2 FETs.67

MGMCs, also referred to as post transition metal chalcogenides,1 comprise elements of main group metals (M) and chalcogens (X), and have stoichiometric compositions of monochalcogenides (MX), dichalcogenides (MX2) and trichalcogenides (M2X3).1 Group IIIA and IVA metals can form MX, with examples of InSe, GaS, GeS or SnS.68–74 MGMCs from group IVA metals also adopt the formula of MX2, such as SnS2, SnSe2 or GeSe2,75–77 while those from group IIIA and VA metals have the formula of M2X3, such as In2Se3, Bi2Se3 or Bi2Te3.78,79 MGMCs have more complex crystalline structures in comparison to TMCs. For example, the 2D materials with the MX formula can have hexagonal, orthorhombic, or monoclinic lattices consisting of multiple atomic layers of M or X.80 Such complexity also engenders anisotropy in the monolayer plane, and the corresponding 2D materials (e.g., SnS) have physical properties depending on lattice directions.81 Similar to TMCs, the MGMCs with the same compositions also have different phases and thus different properties. For example, InSe has four different crystal configurations including β, γ, ε and δ. β-InSe and γ-InSe are the most common crystal structures (Fig. 1c).62 Each cell in β-InSe contains two Se–In–Se–In layers, while γ-InSe contains three Se–In–Se–In layers.80 The room-temperature bandgaps of InSe decrease with the increase of layer numbers (Fig. 1d), which is estimated via photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy operated under three excitation energies.71 The quenching of PL is conspicuous for the monolayer or bilayer InSe (Fig. 1d), and should be attributed to the quantum confinement or a direct to indirect band gap transition.82 These phase and layer number dependent properties in addition to the variety of main group metals make MGMCs an important family of 2D semiconductors.83
MGEs constitute another substantial category of 2D semiconductors composed of only a single element. These monoelemental 2D semiconductors encompass elements from group IIIA, IVA, VA, and even VIA, and have unique names of “Xene” following the nomenclature of graphene.84 Examples include borophene (2D-B),85 silicene (2D-Si),86 germanene (2D-Ge),1,87 stanine (2D-Sn),84 phosphorene (2D-P),88–90 arsenene (2D-As),91–93 antimonene (2D-Sb),91 bismuthine (2D-Bi),94 selenium (2D-Se) and tellurene (2D-Te).95,96 Some of them are very unstable allotropes, such as 2D-B and 2D-Si; therefore their electronic applications are limited. 2D-P and 2D-Te are two most studied MGEs. The bulk form of 2D-P is the most stable P allotrope, black phosphorous (BP), which has demonstrated high carrier mobility and strong in-plane anisotropy.97 Inside a single layer, each phosphorus atom is covalently bonded with three adjacent phosphorus atoms to form a puckered honeycomb structure (Fig. 1e).98 In addition, the bandgaps of 2D-P are dependent on the number of layers (Fig. 1f).97 2D-Te has a unique chiral-chain van der Waals structure that is fundamentally different from layered van der Waals materials (Fig. 1g),99 and has demonstrated high carrier mobility, strong in-plane anisotropic properties, and air stability.96,100
The versatile selection of elements, phases, and layer numbers endows these 2D semiconductors with a myriad of electronic properties and a wide bandgap distribution from the infrared to the ultraviolet range (Fig. 1h). Therefore, the investigation on these 2D semiconductors and solution-based synthesis and assembly should yield an in-depth understanding of these materials and their practical applications in various electronics.
3. Solution-based synthesis approaches
The quality of 2D semiconductors directly affects the performance of electronic devices. As a consequence, it is of great significance to develop simple, feasible and reliable methods to prepare 2D semiconductors. The solution-based synthesis has advantages of scalable production, but the obtained 2D semiconductors typically have small sizes, wide thickness distribution, and high defect densities. In this section, we review the solution-based synthesis of 2D semiconductors, and approaches to tackle these challenges for electronic applications. In general, solution-based synthesis of 2D semiconductors can be classified into two groups: top-down approaches and bottom-up approaches. In the top-down approaches, the weak van der Waals interaction is broken between the stacked layers in bulk crystals to obtain single- or few-layer nanosheets through various external forces.101 In the bottom-up approaches, 2D semiconductors are synthesized directly from the precursors by chemical reaction under certain conditions. All these approaches may attain stable dispersions of 2D semiconductors in suitable solvents.
3.1 Top-down approaches
Top-down approaches comprise methods of liquid phase exfoliation, chemical ion-intercalation exfoliation and electrochemical ion-intercalation exfoliation. Liquid phase exfoliation is a simple and convenient approach, in which the bulk 2D crystals are exfoliated into nanosheets and stabilized in the selected solvents or surfactant solutions via strong sonication or shear energy to break the weak van der Waals forces. In this method, it is critical to choose appropriate solvents or surfactants to match the surface energy and Hansen solubility parameters of the 2D semiconductors, in order to reduce the energy cost to open the layered structure and stabilize the nanosheets after the exfoliation.102–105 Typical solvents are dimethylformamide (DMF), N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO), alcohols, or water, while commonly used surfactants include ionic sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), sodium cholate (SC), or nonionic block copolymers (e.g. Pluronic F68), ethyl cellulose (EC), nitrocellulose.43,103 For example, the dispersions of exfoliated MoTe2, MoSe2, NbSe2, and TaSe2 have been attained in aqueous SC solutions (Fig. 2a).106,107 The same 2D semiconductor can be exfoliated by several solvents or surfactant solutions. For example, stable dispersions of MoS2 have been obtained in the solvents of DMF, NMP, isopropanol/water mixtures, or surfactant solutions such as SDS, F68, SC in water or EC in ethanol.103,106 These solvents and surfactants not only affect the dispersibility of the nanosheet but also influence the exfoliation efficiency.108 One advantage of liquid phase exfoliation is the high crystalline quality inherited from the bulk crystals, which can be inferred from the HRTEM and digitally filtered image of the exfoliated MoS2 (Fig. 2b–e).106 Therefore their electronic properties are conserved even for air-sensitive 2D semiconductors if an inert exfoliation environment can be maintained.105,108

Liquid phase exfoliation is powerful in preparing stable dispersions of almost all 2D semiconductors,101 such as TMCs (e.g., MoS2,106,107 MoSe2,64 WS2,107 WSe2,64 ReS249), MGMCs (e.g., InSe,77,105 SnSe,74 GeTe,109 GeS110), and MGEs (e.g., BP,108,111,112 Se,113 Bi,77,93,94,114 As,93 Sb93). Despite this universality, the obtained materials constantly have wide distributions of size and thickness, leading to different electronic properties, and post-separation procedures are needed to sort them out. The commonly used screening methods are low-speed differential centrifugation115 or high-speed density gradient ultracentrifugation (DGU).49 Differential centrifugation controls the size and thickness of the 2D semiconductors in the dispersions via the centrifugation speed, which determines the sedimentation rate of the exfoliated nanomaterials. A cascading centrifugation sequence allows a meticulous selection of size and thickness in each step (Fig. 2f). The sediment discarded after the first centrifugation mainly includes unexfoliated crystals, while the supernatant after the last centrifugation contains very small nanosheets. The supernatant is centrifuged again at a series of higher speeds or centrifugal forces to collect nanosheets with decreasing size and thickness estimated from the AFM and TEM statistical results (Fig. 2g and h).115 A more precise separation is achieved by DGU. Depending on the traveling directions and equilibrium conditions of sorted species, DGU is classified into sedimentation-based DGU (rate-zonal DGU) and isopycnic DGU.116 The sorting occurs in a density gradient medium, which is prepared by purposeful layering of low-density liquids (typically water) on top of high-density liquids, such as deuterium oxide (1.11 g cm−3),117 iodixanol (1.32 g cm−3),118 or CsCl solutions (1.91 g cm−3).108 The rate-zonal DGU separates the 2D semiconductors according to the different sedimentation rates associated with their size and thickness. The higher viscosity and density of the density gradient media allow longer traveling time of the sorting species in comparison to that in the conventional differential centrifugation, thus allowing more accurate sorting. Isopycnic DGU sorts materials on the basis of their buoyant density, which is determined by the intrinsic density of the materials and thickness of the hydration layers. Therefore, 2D semiconductors are selected according to their thickness rather than size, and are kept at the equilibrium positions in a centrifuge tube after a long duration. In order to sort the high-density 2D semiconductors, copolymer surfactants (e.g., F68) with long hydrophilic chains have been selected to effectively reduce the buoyant density of MoS2 nanosheets for the effective layer-by-layer sorting. Four MoS2 bands with fractions of f7, f17, f27 and f32 are discernable in an ultracentrifuge tube after the first iteration of DGU (Fig. 2i). Fig. 2j shows that the average flake thickness for fractions f7, f17 and f27 is 1.02, 1.84 and 2.52 nm, respectively.118 With such a strategy, precise sorting of ReS2 with an even higher density has also been achieved in the linear density media of CsCl and iodixanol mixtures.108
The chemical ion-intercalation method can exfoliate 2D semiconductors into nanosheets with more uniform size and thickness compared with liquid phase exfoliation. This method takes advantage of the intercalation of ions, such as Li+,119 Na+,120 and K+,120 into the interlayer space of bulk 2D semiconductors to weaken the van der Waals interaction between the layers in a chemical reaction. The subsequent gentle sonication of intercalated intermediates yields single- or few-layer nanosheets dispersed in selected solvents. Despite the high exfoliation efficiency, the ion-intercalation method often has drawbacks of phase transition (e.g., from 2H to 1T for MoS2) of TMCs especially after massive Li+ injection into the 2D crystals, which is not desired if these nanosheets are intended for use as the semiconducting components in electronic applications.61 In order to solve this problem, the amount of embedded Li+ is suggested to be controlled to prevent the phase transition of MoS2.119Fig. 3a shows the preparation of trilayer 2H MoS2 in the reaction of bulk MoS2 crystals with substoichiometric n-butyllithium, in which Li+ ions are inserted preferentially into the more reactive edges of MoS2 crystals.119 The obtained 2H trilayer MoS2 nanosheets with several micron size are clearly shown in TEM images (Fig. 3b). The thickness of the obtained 2H MoS2 nanosheet is 5 nm, further proving its trilayer nature (Fig. 3c).119 Other than MoS2, other 2D semiconductors (such as WS2,121,122 TaS2,123 1T-2H TaSe2/TaS2,124 NbSe2,114 and BP125) have also been chemically intercalated and exfoliated.

The electrochemical ion-intercalation exfoliation method is important for the scalable and high yield production of 2D semiconductors, such as MoS2,60,126,127 WS2,128 WSe2,60 ZrS2,129 BP,130,131 In2Se3,60 Bi2Se3,132 and Bi2Te3.132 Different from other top down approaches, electrochemical exfoliation approaches usually employ 2D semiconductor bulk crystals as the working electrode in two-electrode or three-electrode electrolytic cells (Fig. 3d).128 Lithium metal has been used as the counter electrode in lithium-ion electrolytes for the intercalation of Li+ into the 2D semiconductors. Similar to the chemical intercalation of Li+, the massive electron injection into 2H MoS2 crystal lattices induces undesired phase transition to the metallic 1T phase. In order to solve this problem, Li+ ions have been replaced by large quaternary ammonium cations to generate a more effective volume expansion of the crystals.63 The large size of these cations limits the number of ions that can fit into the lattices and therefore the number of injected electrons. Accordingly, the 2H phase of MoS2 can be reserved in the intercalated compounds.63 Following controlled sonication in polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP)/DMF, stable dispersions of pure phase 2H-MoS2 nanosheets with greenish color are prepared. In contrast, the dispersions of Li-exfoliated MoS2 nanosheets show black color, indicative of the 1T phase (Fig. 3e). The obtained 2H-MoS2 nanosheets have a distribution of 0.5–2 μm for lateral dimensions (Fig. 3f). The Raman spectroscopy of the exfoliated MoS2 nanosheet consistent with the bulk MoS2 confirmed its 2H phase nature (Fig. 3g).63 The electrochemical intercalation of quaternary ammonium cations has also been used to expand the crystal lattices of BP before full exfoliation into uniform BP nanosheets during sonication.131
3.2 Bottom-up approaches
One promising feature of bottom-up approaches is that the shape and size of target products can be regulated by the precursor concentration, reaction time and reaction temperature. There are two typical bottom-up approaches: colloidal synthesis method and solvothermal method.
In a typical colloidal synthesis procedure, metal ion/chalcogen precursors, organic ligands, and solvents are mixed in a flask under Ar or N2 protection, and the 2D semiconductors start to grow at an elevated temperature in a way following the classical LaMer theory: with the evolution of reaction time, the precursors undergo the processes of nucleation, growth and then Ostwald ripening.133 Precursors, ligands and solvents are three indispensable components in the synthesis, with precursors providing the nucleation atoms, ligands maintaining the colloidal stability and governing the morphology of colloidal products, and solvents being the homogeneous reaction media to solvate the precursors and stabilize the synthesized products (it should be noted that solvents can also be a source of precursors or ligands).134 A variety of 2D semiconductors, such as MoS2,135 β-In2Se3,136 InSe,137 SnSe,138 MoSe2,139 WSe2,139 Bi2Se3,140,141 MoxW1−xSe2,142 Bi2Te3,143 and Sb,144 have been successfully synthesized by the colloidal synthesis method. Fig. 4a depicts the detailed synthesis process of In2Se3. As soon as the selenourea was injected into the reaction system of InCl3 in the solvents of oleylamine and 1-octadecene at a temperature of 215 °C, nucleation occurred. Afterwards, dicyandiamide, which has a higher boiling point and a short carbon backbone, was added as the shape controlling agent, leading to the formation of single-layer In2Se3 nanosheets.136 In another example, SnSe nanosheets with a lateral size of 300 nm and a thickness of ∼1.0 nm were synthesized in a reaction medium containing SnCl4·5H2O, SeO2 and oleylamine, utilizing 1,10-phenanthroline as the chelating ligand. The ligands played a critical role in controlling the planar growth of SnSe, while their absence led to a 3D flower-like morphology.138 Although colloidal synthesis enables the preparation of 2D semiconductors with great control, high crystalline quality and scalable production, challenges still remain to be overcome. For example, the ligands or solvents participating in the reactions are difficult to be washed off from the products, which greatly affects the device performance.136,137 In addition, the small size of nanosheets and the intrinsic defects captured during the growth usually impede charge transfer in the thin films.145

In the solvothermal method, the precursors, ligands, and solvents are enclosed in an airtight pressure vessel, and the 2D crystals start to grow in the high-temperature and high-pressure conditions. Fig. 4b shows the schematic representation of a stainless-steel autoclave reactor for solvothermal synthesis in the lab. Due to the uncontrolled nucleation and growth, this method typically yields 2D semiconductors with 3D morphologies. Examples include MoS2,146 WSe2147 and SnS2,148 which have been used in some electronic applications that are more tolerant to defects. The planar growth of large-area 2D semiconductors is very challenging despite being highly desired. One notable example is 2D-Te,96,99,149 which has demonstrated sizes of up to 100 μm using PVP to control the morphology in the synthesis. The PVP enables the growth of the Te chiral-chain crystal lattice into a nanosheet structure (Fig. 4c). The obtained 2D-Te nanosheets are variable in size with a thickness of ∼10 nm (Fig. 4d and e),96 and can be etched into a thickness smaller than 10 nm and ultimately a monolayer by adjusting the pH values of the dispersion.96 This success proves that high quality growth of 2D semiconductors in a substrate-free solution is still feasible in appropriate reaction conditions, which requires more research in the future.
4. Assembly methods
Well-ordered and uniform thin films of 2D semiconductors are necessary for large-area electronics. In addition to the electronic properties of individual exfoliated 2D semiconductors, the performance of these thin films is affected by the conditions of dispersions and the assembly methods. The rheology, concentration, dispersibility, and stability of the 2D semiconductors in the dispersions and the choice of the assembly method determine the morphology and thickness of the thin films.42 In this section, we summarize the typical assembly methods for producing thin films and patterns from 2D semiconductor dispersions.
4.1 Conventional thin-film deposition approaches

Drop casting. 
Drop casting (Fig. 5a) is performed by casting drops of 2D semiconductor dispersion onto the target substrate, followed by the complete removal of solvent at elevated temperatures or in vacuum conditions. This technique is applicable to many 2D semiconductors, such as BP,114 Se,113 Te,150 Bi,94 MoS2,129 WS2,151 Bi2S3152 and InSe,137 and their thin films are used for different electronic applications. By controlling the volume and concentration of the drops onto the substrate, it is possible to control the coverage or thickness of the films. For example, in order to study the heterojunctions of liquid-exfoliated SnS nanosheets and CVD grown WS2, SnS nanosheets are drop-cast on the WS2 surface with three different coverage ratios by controlling the amount of SnS nanosheets (Fig. 5b–d).151 Despite its simplicity, this method suffers from inhomogeneity originating from the well-known coffee-ring effect, and the inability for the attainment of large-scale thin films.153 With highly viscous inks, the variants of drop casting, doctor blading and bar coating, which use a doctor blade or a Mayer rod to control the thickness of the liquid inks, allow the large area deposition of thin films. However, it is still very difficult to control the thickness of coating down to tens of nanometers scale, which is very important for a variety of electronic applications.129

Spray coating. 
Spray coating (Fig. 5e) is processed with the assistance of gas pressure or a high electric voltage to disperse the liquid inks into uniform and fine droplets onto the target substrate.42 The fast evaporation of solvents allows the formation of uniform thin films. With a mask to control the location of drops, spray coating is useful for the patterning of 2D semiconductor thin films,129,154–157 and is convenient and suitable for flexible substrates. The spray-coated film is dense and uniform, as demonstrated for MoS2 and WS2 thin films (Fig. 5f and g).156 Inside the deposited film, there are disordered network structures consisting of predominantly multilayered nanosheets with lateral dimensions of hundreds of nanometers (Fig. 5h).157 Even with these demonstrations, spray coating has several drawbacks. Due to the droplet drying still dominated by the coffee ring effect, the films are not as uniform as needed, and it is challenging to control the thickness down to the nanoscale limit. In addition, the manual alignment of masks limits the accuracy and resolution of patterning. Furthermore, the extensive waste of inks during the spray coating makes the deposition of precious 2D semiconductors unrealistic.


Spin coating. 
Spin coating (Fig. 5i) relies on the spreading of the liquid inks on a spinning substrate with the concomitant solvent evaporation and solid film formation.23 The thickness of the film is controlled by the rotation duration, rotation speed, amount of liquid, and the concentration and viscosity of the liquid dispersions. Repeating the spin operation increases the thickness of coated films in a controllable way. Spin coating has been applied to form thin films of 2D semiconductors, such as MoS2,60,135,158–161 InSe,77 In2Se3,136,162 Bi2S3,163 Bi2Se3,164 Bi2Te3,164 WS2,165 SnS2−xSex,166 and CdSe.167 The spin-coated films are uniform, as demonstrated for the continuous films consisting of evenly overlapping Bi2Se3 nanosheets (Fig. 5j and k).164 Ultrathin SnS1.4 and SnS1.4Se0.5 films were also constructed by spin coating with an average film thickness of 5 nm estimated from the cross-sectional TEM image (Fig. 5l).166 Spin coating is promising for fabricating ultrathin semiconducting thin films from 2D materials due to its simplicity, controllability and reproducibility. However, the successful application of this method requires careful tuning of ink properties and surface properties of the substrates to allow suitable wetting during the ink spreading processes. In addition, the waste of inks during the spin coating may be problematic if the 2D semiconductors are too costly to obtain.


Vacuum filtration. 
Vacuum filtration (Fig. 5m) is an effective method for assembling 2D semiconductors into thin films.42,105,108,109,111,168 The vacuum filtered films are realized under the action of the pressure difference, when nanosheets are separated from the solvents in the inks to form ordered thin films via a porous membrane.42 The thickness of the film is controlled by regulating the pore size of the filtration membrane and the volume and concentration of the liquid dispersions. The filtration membrane can serve as a flexible substrate, allowing the subsequent electrode patterning (Fig. 5n).168 An SEM image of the cross-sectional structure of the MoSe2 films deposited on a nylon filtration membrane reveals a lamellar structure with well-packed nanosheets (Fig. 5n).168 Another benefit of this method is that it can be operated in a glovebox, and therefore some air sensitive 2D semiconductors (e.g., InSe,105 BP108,111) have been assembled into thin films in this way. Due to the limitation of the filtration membrane size, this method is not suitable for large area films. In addition, the film has to be deposited on a porous membrane substrate, which greatly limits its applications, despite the fact that some extra transferring procedure to other substrates has been developed.105,109

4.2 Nanoscale control of thin-film deposition and patterning

Layer-by-layer assembly. 
Layer-by-layer assembly is based on the alternate nanoscale assembly of two species with complementary interactions, such as electrostatic attraction, hydrophobic interactions, or hydrogen bonds.169–171 This nanoadditive manufacturing technique171 allows the nanoscale increment of the thickness and compact and uniform placement of nanosheets if the solution concentration, adsorption duration, and number of cycles are controlled properly. In addition, this technique can be applied in different styles, including immersive assembly, spin assembly, and spray assembly.170 MoS2 thin films have been successfully fabricated by layer-by-layer assembly, by alternately immersing a substrate in positively charged poly(ethylene imine) and negatively charged MoS2 nanosheet solutions (Fig. 6a). MoS2 films with different numbers of multilayers were assembled on a quartz slide by layer-by-layer assembly as shown in Fig. 6b. The intensity of the UV-vis characteristic absorption peak increased linearly with the increasing layer number (Fig. 6c). The cross-sectional TEM shows that the thickness growth in each cycle corresponds to ∼2.2 nm (Fig. 6d).172 Beyond the precise control of the thickness, layer-by-layer assembly has advantages of cyclic use of a small volume of liquid inks, which should be very useful for expensive 2D semiconductors. However, the assembly procedure for multilayers is usually time-consuming, and the charged polymers may introduce trapping and doping into the film which would affect the device performance.

Langmuir–Blodgett assembly. 
Langmuir–Blodgett assembly (Fig. 6e) is an efficient method for preparing high quality monolayer films from 2D semiconductors at a liquid/air interface. The monolayer is formed by floating the 2D semiconductors of choice on a water surface by injecting the liquid dispersion onto the surface with subsequent compression using a pair of sliding barriers.42 By vertically dipping or horizontally lifting the substrate, a compact monolayer film can form on the substrate.173,174Fig. 6f shows the uniform monolayer 2D-Te film on the polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrate through Langmuir–Blodgett assembly.96 In this approach, the 2D semiconductors are required to float on the water steadily with the assistance of easily volatile organic solvents and surface tension.175 Such a liquid/air assembly technique has also been extended to other liquid/liquid interfaces, such as hexane/ethylene glycol interfaces, and generates large-area thin films of WSe2 with superior alignment and thickness control (Fig. 6g).176 The assembly process consists of five steps, including the injection of the WSe2 dispersion, flake confinement and self-assembly, hexane removal, ethylene glycol removal and film deposition, and the final drying at 150 °C (Fig. 6g). Overall, this approach has great control over the film formation; however it is often difficult to spread the 2D semiconductors in the fluid/fluid interfaces, and the use of other solvents may degrade the electronic properties of air-sensitive 2D semiconductors.


Wetting-induced climbing. 
Wetting-induced climbing is a method for the self-assembly of thin films at a vertical air–water interface.177 This method has enabled the transferring of 2D materials assembled in the interface and their composite films on various substrates.177 This approach takes several steps to operate. First, the dispersion containing 2D materials is injected along the wall of a crystallizing dish onto deionized water surface by a syringe pump and then the nanosheets bump and bind with each other via π–π or van der Waals interactions to form a film, gradually covering the entire water surface. Second, a prewetted glass slide is inserted into water, and the assembled film climbs up rapidly along the glass slide by wetting (Fig. 6h). Fig. 6i shows the SEM image of the transferred MoS2 film with a uniform and compact structure, in which the MoS2 nanoplatelets lie flat and contact locally.177 Wetting-induced climbing is dependent on the surface properties of substrates, and is effective for selected 2D materials; therefore its usefulness as a versatile film deposition technology should still be appraised.


Inkjet printing. 
The deposition of solution-processed 2D semiconductor inks at specific locations is a basic requirement for the fabrication of electrodes or channels for electronic devices. The assembly methods mentioned above may enable wafer-scale thin film deposition, but additional patterning and etching are required to fabricate desired devices. Therefore, methods for controllable patterning of 2D semiconductor inks are highly desirable.64,157,175,178–181 Inkjet printing is a computer aided direct-writing technology, in which the patterns and designs are printed through drop-on-demand deposition.182 Inkjet printing has been applied to various 2D materials (Fig. 6j) on arbitrary substrates. For example, all-printed thin-film heterostructures (Fig. 6k),181 transistors64 and photodetectors178–180 have been fabricated from liquid-exfoliated nanosheets. The rheology of inks is required to be tuned in order to be inkjet-printable, and an ink is required to have suitable viscosity, surface tension and density within certain ranges for a certain nozzle.151 The inks can be either water-based,181 using ethylene glycol/water cosolvents with added surfactants (e.g., Triton X-100) or polymeric binders (e.g., polysaccharide xanthan gum), or organic solvent-based,178,179 using NMP or cyclohexanone/terpineol as cosolvents. Higher concentrations of 2D semiconductors are preferred, and the viscosity of inks is positively related to the concentration (Fig. 6l).180 Without complicated etching or transfer procedures, inkjet printing of 2D semiconductors is promising for electronic applications. However, efforts need to be spent to optimize ink properties and printing parameters, which significantly influence the device performance. In addition, the printing spatial resolution is usually limited to 12 μm,183 presenting the physical limit for the scaling of devices and affecting the integration density. It has to be mentioned here that although there are other liquid ink-based printing techniques, such as gravure printing or screen printing,175 they usually require a large volume of inks and are more suitable for printing films thicker than 1 μm; therefore their studies using semiconductor inks are few.

5. Electronic applications
Solution-processed 2D semiconductors with decent mechanical flexibility, tunable electronic properties, high optical transparency, and low-temperature solution processability have promising applications in electronics. In this section, the solution-processed 2D semiconductors applied to field-effect transistors, photodetectors and memristors are reviewed.
5.1 Field-effect transistors
A FET is a three-terminal active device based on the controlled injection of charge carriers into semiconducting channels. In the FET, the electric current flowing from the source and drain terminals is controlled by the gate terminal voltage.41 The semiconductors used for FETs are at least required to have high mobility and current on/off ratios (Ion/Ioff). Therefore, applying solution-processed 2D semiconductors in FETs is an appropriate test scenario to check the reliability and quality of these semiconductors. The intrinsic performance of these nanosheets dispersed in liquids or the overall performance of the thin films has been checked by fabricating the FETs using the individual flake or their thin films. Recent discoveries have demonstrated that the solution-processed 2D semiconductors are indeed promising candidates for semiconducting channels in FETs.60,96,184
The solution-processed single-flake FETs from 2D semiconductors usually deliver better performance than their percolating-film FETs due to the fewer number of defects along the channel and the absent charge carrier hopping between the flakes. The single-flake FETs have been studied for the solution-processed TMCs, MGMCs, and MGEs, such as MoS2,64,107,185,186 WS2,157 InSe,105 Bi2Se3,141 SnS,187 2D-Te,96,149 and BP.108,111 The individual flakes are usually deposited on the substrates (e.g., SiO2/Si) by drop casting or vacuum filtration, with their FETs fabricated by the standard e-beam lithography process.105,111 When flakes are too small to be located, short-channel FETs are fabricated to enable several random flakes to bridge the source and drain electrodes. Fig. 7a shows a single-flake FET with few-layer phosphorene nanosheets as the active layer and Ni/Au as the electrodes. Such a device still ensures a good estimation of intrinsic flake properties.108 Some high-performance single-flake FETs have been demonstrated. One notable example is InSe, whose FET is shown in Fig. 7b. Its transfer curves show n-type behavior with a field-effect mobility of ∼19 cm2 V−1 s−1 and an Ion/Ioff of ∼106 at a drain bias (VDS) of 1 V (Fig. 7c).105 Another example is 2D-Te. Fig. 7d presents the transfer curves of 2D-Te FETs, showing p-type behavior with a field-effect mobility of 700 cm2 V−1 s−1 and an Ion/Ioff of 106 at room temperature. Such high mobility originates from the high crystalline quality of 2D-Te from the hydrothermal growth. Ion/Ioff and mobility are dependent on the thickness of 2D-Te. Carrier mobility increases and Ion/Ioff decreases with the increasing thickness of 2D-Te (Fig. 7e). Surprisingly, 2D-Te has outstanding stability, showing no significant degradation in device performance after being exposed in air for two months without packaging (Fig. 7f).96

Percolating-film FETs from solution-processed 2D semiconductors have advantages of being integrated in large-area electronics with more homogeneous device performance, since the local variations of the percolating films average out when the device area is larger than the size of individual 2D flakes. The charge carriers in the percolating networks consisting of multiple overlapping flakes are required to overcome both the inherent resistance of flakes and the junction resistance between flakes, with the latter usually dominating the electrical behavior. In addition, in a conventional dielectrically gated FET structure, the semiconducting layer should not be too thick, otherwise the gate terminal would lose control over the channel due to the strong electrostatic shielding.188 Therefore, percolating-film FETs require the fabrication using defect-less 2D semiconductors with small and uniform thickness and a suitable assembly method with meticulous thickness control. While these two requirements are not easy to satisfy, Kelly et al. reported an alternative way to circumvent these challenges by adopting electrolytic gating of ionic liquids (Fig. 8a).64 The WS2 or MoSe2 semiconductors in this study were obtained by liquid exfoliation in NMP with a broad thickness distribution, and the thickness of their thin films was controlled from hundreds of nanometers to several micrometers by spray coating. In order to effectively control the conduction behavior of these semiconducting channels, BN networks impregnated with ionic liquids (1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide) were used as the dielectric layer. Under the electrolytic gating, the all-printed FETs demonstrated p-type transfer characteristics for WS2 and n-type transfer characteristics for MoSe2 with a maximum Ion/Ioff of 600 (Fig. 8b).64 With the SC stabilized WS2 flakes in aqueous inks, a different n-type WS2 electrolytic FET was demonstrated with an Ion/Ioff over 104 and an estimated electron mobility around 0.01 cm2 V−1 s−1 (Fig. 8c).157 Charge transport studies proved that the interlayer hopping in this network is a major limiting factor.157

There is considerable progress in obtaining ultrathin semiconducting films from high quality solution-processed 2D semiconductors for well-performed dielectrically gated FETs. Lin et al. reported such percolating-film FETs from MoS2 with optimum performance.60 The 2H-MoS2 nanosheets were obtained from the controlled electrochemical intercalation with a narrow thickness distribution of 3.8 ± 0.9 nm and lateral dimensions of 0.5–2 μm. Their spin-coated thin films consisted of two to three layers of stacked nanosheets with an average thickness of ∼10 nm. Such uniform films enabled the preparation of arrays of FETs on a wafer scale (Fig. 8d). These FETs demonstrated n-type FET behavior with well-behaved output and transfer characteristics (Fig. 8e and f) with an estimated mobility around 7–11 cm2 V−1 s−1 and an Ion/Ioff of 106. These device metrics are better than other solution-processed MoS2 FETs reported so far (Table 2).107 Percolating film-FETs based on films made from the molecular precursors also demonstrate high performance, such as FETs of SnS1.4Se0.5166 or In2Se3.162,189

The performance of FETs from solution-processed 2D semiconductors is benchmarked against that from CVD or mechanical exfoliation in Table 2.12,17,71,76,95,98,190–212 It is shown that solution-processed FETs are still inferior in terms of mobility, which mainly originates from the generated defects in the flakes due to exposure to the solvent or air, unoptimized contacting electrodes, and the necessity of interlayer hopping for the percolating films. However, we still observe that such a performance gap is closing, and the solution-based device metrics are comparable to those from the state-of-the-art organic semiconductors.213,214 In addition, the solution-based inks from 2D semiconductors offer unmatchable advantages of scaling-up capabilities, low cost, and flexibility in comparison to CVD grown or mechanically exfoliated 2D semiconductors. There should be broad space for further development and more practical applications in this area.
5.2 Photodetectors
Photodetectors are a type of electronic device that can transform a light signal into an electrical signal, and these devices play a crucial role in infrared imaging, environmental monitoring and optical communication.215 In order to read the electrical signals, the photodetector can adopt the architecture of two-terminal photoconductors and photodiodes, or three-terminal phototransistors and photoelectrochemical (PEC)-type devices.77,216 2D semiconductors, whose electronic structures and optical properties are strongly related, have demonstrated remarkable photodetection characteristics.217 A set of figures of merit are defined to evaluate the performance of photodetectors such as responsivity (R) or specific detectivity (D*).215 The responsivity or R is defined as the ratio of the photocurrent to the incident light power and can be expressed as , where Ip is the photocurrent and P is the incident light power. Specific detectivity or D* represents the sensitivity of a photodetector and is defined as , where A is the area of the device, B is the bandwidth, iN is the noise current spectra at 1 Hz bandwidth with units of A Hz−1/2 and R is the responsivity.215 Similar to the applications for FETs, the solution-processed 2D semiconductors can be employed either as individual flakes or as assembled thin films for the semiconducting layer in photodetectors. Due to the limited size of the individual flakes, single-flake photodetectors are often used in the form of two-terminal photoconductors or three-terminal phototransistors.99,105,136,148,218,219 The percolating-film photodetectors can adopt either one of the four architectures, such as photoconductors,147,163,168,173,180,181,220 photodiodes,77,165,221 phototransistors109,137,179 and PEC-type devices.94,113,150,222
2D semiconductors made from either liquid phase exfoliation or colloidal synthesis have been used for single-flake photodetectors. Multilayer InSe is a direct-bandgap semiconductor, and therefore is a promising candidate for optoelectronics. Using the same FET architecture in Fig. 7b, the photodetectors made from the liquid-exfoliated InSe showed a maximum R of 5 × 107 A W−1 at a laser (wavelength = 515.6 nm) power intensity of 10−6 W cm−2 with the FET operated in the accumulation mode (VGS = 8 V, VD = 1 V, Fig. 7b).105 Similarly, colloidally synthesized single-layer β-In2Se3 nanosheets were used in a photoconductor-type photodetector (Fig. 9a). With Ti/Au electrode contacts, the two-terminal device showed a linear current–voltage (I–V) curve upon illumination and the current responded sensitively to the change of the intensity of the 532 nm laser (Fig. 9a). The photodetector revealed higher R with Ti/Al electrodes than with Ti/Au electrodes at the same laser wavelength and incident laser power, which was largely attributed to the lower work function of Al (around 4 eV) compared to Au (around 5 eV) that resulted in a smaller Schottky barrier (Fig. 9b). The R had an inverse power relationship with the incident laser power, and was related to the different metal contacts (Fig. 9b). Such a decrease of R with increasing light power is due to the enhanced recombination of photogenerated carriers by defects at higher light powers.221 When the impinging light power was in the fW range, the R was up to 7 × 104 A W−1, despite the fact that β-In2Se3 is an indirect band gap semiconductor.136 The modulation frequencies of this photodetector were at least 160 Hz with a rise time of 2.5 ms and a fall time of 3.7 ms (Fig. 9c).136 In order to increase the light absorption of the 2D semiconductors, especially those with indirect bandgaps, optical cavity substrates were employed to improve the light response.99 An example is shown in Fig. 9d, in which Au/Al2O3 thin films were used as the optical cavity to improve the performance of 2D-Te photodetectors.99 2D-Te is an indirect bandgap semiconductor with a bandgap of 0.31 eV, which is suitable for short-wave infrared photodetectors.99 The Al2O3 thickness was adjusted to allow the tuning of the peak absorption wavelength, and the total absorption could be increased by over 2 orders of magnitude in comparison to the sample on Si/SiO2.99 With the Al2O3 thickness selection to 550 nm, 150 nm, and 350 nm, the absorption was optimized at 1.4, 1.8, and 2.2 μm, respectively (Fig. 9e and f).99 The peak R was 13 A W−1 at a wavelength of 1.4 μm and 8 A W−1 at a wavelength of 2.4 μm, while the optimized D* was 2 × 109 cm Hz1/2 W−1 at room temperature and a wavelength of 1.7 μm.99 In addition, the light can be modulated over a wide frequency range from 100 mHz to 100 kHz.99 These device metrics show the great potential of solution-processed semiconducting single flakes for high-performance photodetectors.

Solution-assembled 2D semiconductor thin films offer the competitive advantage of preparing large-area photodetector arrays.105,181 The junction resistance between the flakes and the intrinsic abundant defects on the edges usually make the performance of percolating-film photodetectors inferior to that of single-flake photodetectors.105,109 A comparison between these two types of photodetectors181 is shown in Fig. 10a–d with GaTe as the semiconducting channels, which has a direct bandgap of ∼1.7 eV.109 The photodetectors adopted the FET configuration (Fig. 10a and c), and GaTe nanosheets were obtained by the liquid phase exfoliation in ethanol/water mixtures. The absence of residual surfactants or solvents on the GaTe nanosheet made the single-flake phototransistor devices show a maximum R of ∼2 × 106 A W−1 at a laser (wavelength = 515.6 nm) intensity of ∼10−6 W cm−2 with VGS and VDS values of −20 and −1 V, respectively. Similar to other single-flake photodetectors, the responsivity was inversely related to the incident laser power (Fig. 10b). As to the phototransistors made from the vacuum-filtered GaTe thin films, the responsivity was reduced by several orders of magnitude, and showed a positive trend with increasing light intensity (Fig. 10d). This different behavior was explained by the two-level Shockley–Read–Hall recombination process and the photothermal effect. Ultimately, these physical processes led to a measured R of 0.2 A W−1 at 0.8 W cm−2, which represented the highest value among the solution processed thin-film photodetectors (Fig. 10e).109

Using the solution-processed 2D semiconductors, it is possible to apply printing methods to make an all-printed photodetector.178–181 The electrodes requiring high conductance can be printed with graphene180,181 or silver179 inks. The source and drain electrodes can be placed either side by side179,180 or layer by layer181 with the semiconducting films, forming the lateral or vertical geometries. A photodetector consisting of an all-printed graphene/WS2/graphene vertical heterostructure is shown in Fig. 10f.181 The graphene and WS2 inks were both water-based. By printing these devices on porous paper, an R of 1 mA W−1 was obtained, and the photocurrent was increased without saturation when the laser power (wavelength = 514 nm) was increased (Fig. 10g).181 With laterally placed graphene electrodes, an R of 50 mA W−1 was demonstrated for all-printed MoS2 photodetectors at an irradiation intensity of 0.6 W cm−2.180 The graphene and MoS2 inks were dispersed in organic solvents with the assistance of EC.180 The whole device was photonically annealed to lower the processing temperature.180 All the printed photodetectors showed almost unchanged performance during flexing when they were fabricated on plastic substrates.180,181
The solution processed 2D semiconductors are combined with other semiconductors, forming junction-type photodetectors or photodiodes, to improve the light response. Fig. 10h shows the schematic illustration of the WS2/Si photodiode with a transparent graphene top contact.165 WS2 microrods composed of layered nanosheets were synthesized in a solvothermal reaction.165 Due to the localized surface plasmon resonance effect induced by the oxygen doping, the WS2 had broad near-infrared absorption above 1100 nm in addition to the absorption related to its bandgap of 1.2 eV.165 Benefiting from the photovoltaic effect of the photodiode (Fig. 10i), the WS2/Si heterojunction served as a self-driven photodetector with an R of 12.6 mA W−1, a D* of ∼2 × 1012 cm Hz1/2 W−1, and fast rise/fall times of 2.0/7.2 μs at a laser (wavelength = 650 nm) intensity of 1.55 μW cm−2 and zero bias.165 The R was increased to 1.54 A W−1 at −2.0 V bias due to the higher photocurrent.165 Owing to the light absorption of WS2 in the near-infrared region, the photodetector was effective for infrared light detection.165 In order to improve light absorption, the Si was processed into a pyramid structure, which formed a 3D heterojunction with a solution-processed reduced graphene oxide-MoS2 layer.221 In the self-driven mode, the photodetector exhibited an R of 21.8 A W−1, a D* of 3.8 × 1015 cm Hz1/2 W−1, and fast rise/fall times of 2.8/46.6 μs at a laser (wavelength = 650 nm) power of 100 nW.221 Such a photodetector also demonstrated an ultrabroad spectrum response ranging from 350 nm to 4.3 μm, as the solution processed thin films have a widened light absorption range induced by the structural defects.221 The solution-processed 2D semiconductors can also be coupled with other 2D materials to improve the light detection performance. For example, liquid-phase exfoliated SnS nanosheets were decorated onto the CVD grown WS2 monolayers by drop-casting to improve the R and light/dark signal-to-noise ratios.223
Apart from solid-state photodetectors, PEC-type photodetectors have been widely adopted. These devices rely on the photon response of a PEC cell with the thin films of 2D semiconductors as one of the electrodes. Several 2D semiconductors have been used in PEC-type photodetectors, such as Se, Te, Bi, InSe, and BP.77,94,113,150,222 Generally, 2D semiconductor films are assembled on indium-tin oxide (ITO) coated conductive glass and its electrical response to light intensity was measured in a PEC cell. One of the high-performance PEC-type photodetectors was made from liquid-exfoliated few-layer InSe nanosheets, which have a direct bandgap (Fig. 10j). The InSe thin films on ITO were deposited by drop casting the InSe nanosheets in ethanol, serving as the photoanode in the PEC cell. The photoelectric response test was carried out in 0.2 M KOH with Pt as the counter electrode, saturated calomel electrode as the reference electrode, and a Xenon arc lamp as the light source, and demonstrated a response time of 5 s and photoresponsivity of 3.3 to 4.9 μA W−1. In addition, it was found that the photocurrent density was linearly increased with the irradiance power intensity (Fig. 10k), while the responsivity had an opposite variation trend (Fig. 10l).77
Despite the rapid progress in solution-processed 2D semiconductor photodetectors, their overall performances are still inferior to the best reported devices using CVD grown or mechanically exfoliated 2D semiconductors (Table 3).70,77,105,109,136,147,150,165,180,181,218,220,222,224–233 The inferiority largely originates from the higher defect densities on the solution processed semiconductors together with the hopping energy barriers along the interflake junctions. The various defects in the 2D semiconductors may scatter or trap the photogenerated charge carriers, and therefore reduce the efficiency of charge collection under an electrical bias, leading to decreased photoresponsivity and poor sensitivity. Still, these solution-processed devices are comparable to or show much higher performance than other solution-processed photodetectors using polymers, quantum dots or metal-halide perovskites.7 In addition, the advantages of solution-processed photodetectors should not be overlooked, such as scalability, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness. In addition, we observe that other device metrics, such as −3 dB bandwidth, linear dynamic range, noise-equivalent power, and spectral selectivity, are often missed in the various reports on related materials, which should deserve more attention if there is serious consideration for their practical applications in the future.

5.3 Memristors
Memristors, one of the fundamental circuit elements, are resistive memory devices for energy-efficient nonvolatile memory and logics.234–236 They can be basically programmed into any state by controlling the electrical signal amplitude or width, and typically are used in two states: high resistance state (HRS) and low resistance state (LRS). The resistance switching in memristors relies on ion moving or ionic valence changing driven by the electrical field; therefore 2D semiconductors with metal ions having variable oxidation states are interesting candidates for this application.237 The high transparency and excellent flexibility of 2D semiconductors also make it possible to prepare transparent, flexible and wearable electronic memory devices. Besides, solution-processed 2D semiconductors provide additional advantages, such as scalable processing and higher defect density levels, and thus may offer large-area memristors and more tunable resistance states. Memristors are usually evaluated by their switching on/off current ratios, cycling stability, retention time, and switching voltages.236
Thin films from liquid-exfoliated 2D semiconductors have been used as the active layer in the memristors, and they are usually sandwiched between the top and bottom electrodes (Fig. 11a–d). The memristors typically display a bipolar switching behavior with the set and reset voltages at different polarities (Fig. 11a and d). One of the most studied memristive semiconductors is MoS2 (Table 4). Insulating polymers or moieties are usually coupled with MoS2 to ensure a stable HRS and charge trapping.135,160,161,238–240 An example is shown in Fig. 11a with the active layer of MoS2 and PVP, the top electrode of Al, and the bottom electrode of graphene oxide.161 The MoS2–PVP based memristor demonstrated the typical current–voltage hysteric curve with set/reset voltages of 3.5 V and −4.5 V and a switching on/off current ratio of 102 (Fig. 11b).161 The switching mechanism was believed to be charge trapping and detrapping behavior of MoS2 in the PVP. Liquid-exfoliated BP nanosheets have also been applied similarly in a memristor with Al and indium tin oxide as the top and bottom electrodes.114 The degradation of BP upon ambient exposure induced the automatic formation of an amorphous top degraded layer, which served as an insulating barrier in the HRS (Fig. 11c). The applied negative bias drove the diffusion of oxygen ions to induce the formation of conductive channels or filaments, and transitioned the device into LRS. The thin-film BP memristor had set/reset voltages less than 2 V in magnitude, an on/off current ratio of 3 × 105 (Fig. 11d), and a retention time of more than 105 s.114 The conduction mechanism in these types of devices was usually dominated by the thermionic emission and the space-charge limited current in the HRS and Ohm's law in the LRS (Fig. 11b).161 The devices can be made to be flexible using the flexible top and bottom electrodes (Fig. 11d).

The performance of memristors has been further improved by an ultrathin metal oxide layer formed on top of the thin films of 2D semiconductors.175 The MoOx/MoS2 or WOx/WS2 heterostructures sandwiched between printed Ag electrodes on a plastic foil (Fig. 11e and f) demonstrated an impressive switching on/off current ratio of 106 combined with low programming voltages of 0.1–0.2 V (Fig. 11h).175 The top electrodes could be replaced by a sparse distribution of silver nanowires to minimize the switching area (Fig. 11g). These heterostructures were realized by thermal or photonic oxidation of MoS2 or WS2 thin films made by LB assembly. The silver/metal oxide layer served as a Schottky barrier that blocked the current, and the barrier was modulated by the electrically activated anionic motion, leading to the change of resistance.175 The use of silver nanowires as electrodes further limited the off current by reducing the contact area. Due to the size-dependent Schottky barriers, the conduction of current at the HRS follows the thermionic emission model.175 In addition, such a memristor is analogous to a biological synapse, showing a non-volatile setting of the resistance caused by repeated stimulation of 0.6 s (Fig. 11i).175 Nonlinear switching dynamics were demonstrated with a gradual resistance switching at the beginning and an abrupt jump occurring after 25 s, which resembled the multilevel deterministic and binary probabilistic synaptic scheme.175
Other than liquid-exfoliated 2D semiconductors, colloidally synthesized ones are also suitable candidates for the memristors,135,146,159 and one of the examples is shown in Fig. 11j. The synthesized MoS2 nanosheets offered higher uniformity in their size and thickness distribution than liquid-exfoliated ones, and were able to form a thin layer over a 4-inch wafer by spray coating (Fig. 11k). By thermally oxidizing the surfaces, an ultrathin film of layered MoOx/MoS2 was formed, and then sandwiched between two Al electrodes to complete the fabrication of a memristor (Fig. 11j). Unlike other devices discussed in this section, the device demonstrated a unipolar resistance switching with the set/reset voltages at the same polarities (Fig. 11l). The switching was governed by the generation and elimination of conducting filaments at the submicron scale at the set/reset operation. Notably, the memristors made from such a thin film outperformed the control devices using the liquid exfoliated MoS2 in the aspect of switching on/off current ratios (Fig. 11m). Such a dramatic increase was attributed to the higher density of oxidative sites in the colloidally synthesized MoS2 after the oxidation. In addition, the devices showed a retention time of 10000 s at elevated temperatures as high as 150 °C, and further enabled the fabrication of a novel flexible data storage and display system.
Solution-processed semiconductors demonstrate tremendous potential for application in high-performance memristors. Their performances are comparable to or even better than those of the memristors made from mechanically exfoliated and CVD grown 2D materials (Table 4).114,135,144,161,175,239,241–246 This fact is reasonable since high crystalline quality is not required for memristors. Despite this, there are still fundamental questions to be answered as to the switching mechanism. For example, the role of interfaces in the switching behavior is still ambiguous due to the complex nature of aggregated nanosheets, although there is considerable progress in implementing mechanically exfoliated flakes to illustrate the process of resistance variation.144 In addition, the effect of processing parameters on the switching characteristics should be more carefully studied, as the same active materials, such as MoOx/MoS2 heterostructures, have exhibited disparate switching voltages and operation modes in different reports. Furthermore, challenges still have to be overcome to continuously scale down the dimensions of these memristors and integrate them into future data storage and neuromorphic computing technologies.
6. Summary and outlook
In summary, we have provided an overview of the categories, synthesis, assembly and applications of solution processed 2D semiconductors. These semiconductors hold great promise for economical large-area electronics, and recent research effort has pushed their device metrics to a level competitive with those fabricated from mechanically exfoliated or CVD grown semiconductors. They are key candidates to fill the important roles as materials for cost-effective and flexible electronic components to be integrated in wearable systems or smart devices in the upcoming 5G and internet of things era.
Considerable opportunities and challenges are on the way to fully exploit the unique benefits of solution-processed 2D semiconductors. (1) The intrinsic defects in the solution-processed 2D semiconductors have a deleterious effect on the charge transport in FETs and photodetectors. Therefore, it is important to develop more effective exfoliation/synthetic procedures to minimize the density of defects. Controlled chemical or electrochemical ion intercalation and exfoliation has proved to be potent in the preparation of high-quality 2D semiconductors, but further research is still required to fully remedy the exfoliation-induced defects. The solution-processed 2D semiconductors by colloidal synthesis or hydrothermal growth usually have high-density defects due to the low growth temperature and unregulated growth dynamics. As such, devotion to the research of 2D growth mechanisms using the in situ characterization tools may yield better control of the crystalline quality. (2) Uniform and ordered thin films of solution-processed 2D semiconductors are an indispensable prerequisite for wafer-scale devices. With the advent of high-quality solution-processed 2D semiconductors of more uniform size and thickness, their reliable assembly methods deserve more investigation. The electronic coupling between different flakes is still dominated by van der Waals interactions. Therefore, it is crucial to make the flake surface as clean as possible when the films are assembled. In addition, methods to improve the coupling by ligand chemistry may be an alternative if the adverse effects of defect generation and strong electronic coupling can be balanced. (3) The device research using solution-processed 2D semiconductors is still at the early stage. The device physics requires more in-depth research, and extra thorough device characterization is required to give a full evaluation of their practical applications. Besides, continual scaling of the devices from solution-processed 2D semiconductors is necessary to miniaturize the devices for higher integration density. The channel scaling to a length scale smaller than the flake size would improve the device performance due to the absence of junction resistance.
It should be noted that we may have only revealed the tip of the iceberg of the very interesting field of solution-processed 2D semiconductors for electronic applications. The solution-processed 2D semiconductors discussed in this review are mainly layered inorganic semiconductors, and we observe that reports on the synthesis of some nonlayered semiconductors (e.g., CdTe) into colloidal 2D nanosheets are emerging.247,248 Although there are few reports on their electronic applications possibly due to the defects induced by the broken bonds on their surfaces, their potential should not be overlooked when we reflect on the history of quantum dot FETs.27–32 Furthermore, the electronic applications of solution-processed 2D semiconductors are not limited to the three types of devices discussed here, and they may be applied in other electronics, such as solar cells, sensors, light-emitting diodes, and electrochromic windows. We envision that more devices will tend to incorporate various types of solution-processed 2D semiconductors for improved performance.
