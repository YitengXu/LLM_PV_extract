    , Accepted 12th March 2019First published on 13th March 2019AbstractHerein, four pyridine-based chelating ligands, including 1,10-phenanthroline, 4,4′-bipyridine, 4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline (Bphen) and pyridine, are used as surface treatment agents for improving the electronic properties of perovskite materials. The results of the steady-state photoluminescence (PL), time resolved PL and hole-only devices made of CH3NH3PbBr3 thin films suggest that the traps are effectively passivated after post-deposition surface treatment with bidentate chelating ligands, including 1,10-phenanthroline and 4,4′-bipyridine. Furthermore, the coordination capability of Bphen was suppressed which is probably due to its two additional phenyl groups, resulting in a steric hindrance effect. When compared with mono-dentate chelating pyridine, bidentate chelating ligands are more active in the current study. Finally, perovskite light-emitting diodes (PeLEDs) are fabricated and the devices exhibit a nearly doubled device efficiency after passivation with 1,10-phenanthroline. It is anticipated that the approach proposed here is a general method for improving the photonic properties of perovskite materials and the device performance of PeLEDs.
Introduction
Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites have been recognized as a promising family of materials for application in a wide variety of optoelectronic devices, including photovoltaics,1–4 lasers,5–7 light-emitting diodes (LEDs),8–10 soft X-ray detectors11 and photodetectors,12 due to their intrinsic outstanding physical properties, such as high absorption coefficients, long charge diffusion length, and high photoluminescence (PL) yields. In particular, a certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 23.3% has been reported for perovskite solar cells (PeSCs), indicating that their performance was comparable to that of commercial single crystalline silicon solar cells.13 However, most perovskite thin films prepared by conventional solution processes contain dense structural defects and grain boundaries, which still significantly hinder the carrier transport and/or result in nonradiative recombination.14 Many approaches have been proposed for improving thin film quality during the preparation of thin films, thereby reducing the density of defects.14–16 For instance, Jeon et al. revealed a solvent-engineering methodology for preparing dense perovskite layers.15 The Lewis acid–base adduct approach has also been proposed for controlling the crystal growth and morphology of the perovskite layers by taking advantage of the weak chemical bonding between the lead halide precursors (Lewis acid) and the adducts (Lewis base).16
The other type of approach for fixing the defects is surface treatments that can passivate the traps of the as-prepared perovskite films. For instance, Noel et al. treated the surfaces of the perovskite layers with Lewis bases, including thiophene and pyridine, to reduce nonradiative electron–hole recombination within the perovskite films.17 The PCEs of planar heterojunction solar cells enhanced after the electronic passivation of under-coordinated Pb ions within the crystals. The influence of the pyridine vapor treatment on the microstructure and the local carrier lifetime in PSCs was further investigated.18 The authors found that the pyridine treatment indeed remediated the nonradiative defects; the originally dark grains in the perovskite films could be activated and become bright regions again after passivation. More recently, Wang et al. introduced benzylamines as a surface passivating agent for improving the device stability against moisture and simultaneously increasing the device efficiencies.19 Yue et al. also demonstrated that the incorporation of pyridine-based additives into the hole-transporting layer improved the stability of PeSCs.20 Additionally, Lin et al. reported the use of a π-conjugated Lewis base for passivating the traps in PeSCs.21 The Lewis base behaved as an n-type semiconductor and an interlayer between CH3NH3PbI3 and the cathode; it effectively helped to extract the electrons. For perovskite LEDs (PeLEDs), Lee et al. introduced amine-based molecules, including ethylenediamine and polyethylenimine, to passivate the surface of the perovskite films, thereby achieving high efficiency and better stability of PeLEDs.22
Indeed, as compared with PeSCs, there are still very few studies investigating the effects of surface passivation on the performance of PeLEDs. Herein, we report on the improvement in the efficiency of PeLEDs after post-deposition surface treatment with aromatic bidentate chelating ligands, including 1,10-phenanthroline, 4,4′-bipyridine and 4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline (Bphen). We have found that the PL intensities of CH3NH3PbBr3 thin films can be enhanced after surface treatment using these aromatic ligands. Furthermore, the prolonged PL lifetimes suggested the effective passivation of the defects in perovskite thin films. The unsaturated or under-coordinated Pb ions, which are Lewis acids, were considered to be electronic traps in perovskite thin films.18,20 Therefore, aromatic chelating ligands, which behaved as Lewis bases, could effectively react with Lewis acids and passivate the defects. The morphologies of the perovskite films were also examined using X-ray diffraction (XRD), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Moreover, the lower defect densities, which were deduced from the current–voltage curves of the hole-only devices after the treatment, also supported the functions of the ligands. Finally, PeLEDs were fabricated and the device passivated with 1,10-phenanthroline exhibited a nearly doubled device efficiency. We anticipate that the approach proposed here could be a general method for improving the PL efficiencies and the device performance of PeLEDs.
Experimental
Chelating ligands and PbBr2 were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The hole-transporting material, 9,9-bis[4-[(4-ethenylphenyl)methoxy]phenyl]-N2,N7-di-1-naphthalenyl-N2,N7-diphenyl-9H-fluorene-2,7-diamine (VB-FNPD), and CH3NH3Br were obtained from Lumtech.23 All the materials were used as received.
PeLEDs were fabricated on indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass substrates; the device structure is shown in Fig. 1(a). The substrates were cleaned with detergent, acetone, and isopropanol sequentially, and then dried in an oven for at least 24 h prior to use. Before deposition of thin films, the substrates were treated with UV ozone. Then poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)/polystyrenesulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) was spin-coated onto the substrates and then baked at 150 °C for 10 min. The substrates were then transferred into a N2-filled glovebox. A solution of VB-FNPD in dimethylformamide (DMF) (1.2 wt%) was spin-coated on the PEDOT:PSS layer. The sample was thermally annealed at 100 °C for 30 min and then at 230 °C for 90 min to complete the thermal crosslinking reaction. A precursor solution of PbBr2 (1 M) and CH3NH3Br (1.05 M) having a molar ratio of 1:1.05 was prepared in DMF under stirring at least for 24 h. The precursor solution was spin-coated on the VB-FNPD layer and was annealed at 100 °C for 15 min. The chelating ligands were dissolved in toluene (0.2 wt%). For surface treatment, the ligand solutions were spin-coated on the perovskite layers at 2000 rpm for 60 s. Then, the samples were annealed at 100 °C for 15 min. Subsequently, the electron-transporting layer, 2,2′,2′′-(1,3,5-benzinetriyl)-tris(1-phenyl-1-H-benzimidazole) (TPBi), was prepared by spin-coating its toluene solution on the perovskite layers; the resulting film was then subjected to thermal annealing at 100 °C for 15 min. Finally, an 80 nm layer of Ag was deposited as the cathode. Then, all the devices were encapsulated by cover glasses and sealed with UV-cured epoxy prior to characterization in air. The electrical characteristics of the LED devices were measured using a Keithley 2400 source measure unit and a PR655 spectrascan colorimeter. PL and time-resolved PL (TRPL) measurements were performed using a micro-PL system. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed using a PHI 5000 VersaProbe system. All measurements were performed in air.

Results and discussion

Fig. 1 shows the device structure investigated in this study and the chemical structures of the aromatic chelating ligands. The perovskite CH3NH3PbBr3 layer was deposited on a cross-linked hole-transporting layer, VB-FNPD.23 After post-annealing of the CH3NH3PbBr3 films, bidentate chelating ligands, including 1,10-phenanthroline, 4,4′-bipyridine, and Bphen, were further spin-coated on the perovskite light-emitting layers. Note that the mono-dentate chelating agent pyridine was also used in surface treatments as a reference passivating material.17,18Fig. 2(a) displays the absorption spectra of the CH3NH3PbBr3 films before and after the surface treatments. We can see that the absorption spectra were almost identical, indicating that no apparent chemical reactions occurred within the bulk of the perovskite films. On the other hand, the steady-state PL intensities of the CH3NH3PbBr3 films significantly increased after surface treatment with 1,10-phenanthroline, 4,4′-bipyridine and pyridine [Fig. 3(a)]. The results suggested the decreased level of nonradiative recombination after the passivation process. Interestingly, the CH3NH3PbBr3 film treated with Bphen behaved very differently from other samples; the PL intensity was comparable to that of the control sample after the surface treatment. Bphen is a very common electron transporting material in the field of organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs)24 and is also used in other areas such as organic and perovskite solar cells.25 The chemical structure of Bphen is very similar to that of 1,10-phenanthroline (Fig. 1). Bphen is also a bidentate chelating ligand, but the additional two phenyl groups of Bphen probably led to a steric hindrance effect, which prevented or retarded the interactions between the ligands and the defects. Previously, Yue et al. prepared mesoscopic PeSCs with various pyridine-based additives in the hole-transporting layer.20 They observed that the additive containing a long alkyl chain modulated the reaction activity. It decreased the coordination capability of pyridine with lead ions. The authors also claimed that the steric hindrance effect may also affect its diffusion to the perovskite layer.20 Similarly, we suspect that the larger size of the Bphen molecules could also make it more difficult for them to diffuse to the defect sites within the film through surface defects, such as grain boundaries. Therefore, Bphen did not exhibit apparent passivating ability. However, more evidence was required for further validating this assumption.

Fig. 4 displays the C 1s XPS spectra of the perovskite films prepared by various treatments. Before surface treatments, the peak could be well fitted into a single peak, which centered at 284.3 eV; it can be assigned to C–N bonds [Fig. 4(a)]. We attributed the peak to the presence of CH3NH3+ ions in the perovskite films. After treatments, we can see that the XPS spectra of the treated films changed, confirming the presence of the ligands on the perovskite surfaces [Fig. 4(b–e)]. For the samples treated with 1,10-phenanthroline, 4,4′-bipyridine and pyridine [Fig. 4(b–d)], one additional peak centered at 283.8 eV appeared. It should represent the C–C bonds of the ligands. For the sample treated with Bphen, a dominating peak appeared at 282.8 eV, implying the presence of abundant sp2 carbons [Fig. 4(e)]. These results confirmed the successful surface treatments of the CH3NH3PbBr3 films.

The TRPL behavior of the perovskite films was further investigated for further understanding the passivation effects; Fig. 3(b) shows the PL decays of the CH3NH3PbBr3 films after various surface treatments. The lifetimes of the samples could be fitted using a bi-exponential decay equation. The fast decay process has been assigned to surface recombination and the second slower decay corresponds to radiative recombination.26 The fitting results are summarized in Table 1. From the calculated lifetimes, we can see that they all became longer after the surface treatments, suggesting that the surface passivation reduced the trap densities. The TRPL results were almost consistent with those of the above steady-state PL. Both experimental results indicated that the bidentate chelating ligands were more active passivating materials as compared with the reference monodentate chelating ligand, pyridine. The underlying mechanism is still unknown, and it certainly requires further investigation. However, we suspect that the coordination reactions between the under-coordinated Pb ions and/or Pb clusters and the bidentate chelating ligands may result in a higher entropy.27

The trap density of each sample was also estimated by measuring the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) through the perovskite films.28 The hole transport was investigated by making hole-only devices. The device architecture was ITO/PEDOT:PSS/CH3NH3PbBr3/MoO3/Ag; the perovskite layers were also treated with various ligands before the deposition of the hole-injection layer, MoO3. Fig. 5 shows the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the hole-only devices in the dark. Assuming that the J–V dependence is J ∝ Vn, the curves clearly showed three different regions. At low biases, a linear relationship between J and V was observed, suggesting a typical Ohmic region. In other words, the value of the exponent n was equal to 1 in the first region. At higher biases, the curves entered the superlinear region beyond the trap-filled limit voltage (VTFL), which is determined by the trap density (nt) according to the following equation,28 (1)where e is the elementary charge, L is the thickness of the film, ε is the dielectric constant, and ε0 is the vacuum permittivity, respectively. The dielectric constant (ε) is estimated to be 28.7.29 From eqn (1), the trap density of the reference sample was 1.35 × 1017 cm−3. The value of nt decreased to 5.94 × 1016, 6.80 × 1016, 7.13 × 1016, and 1.05 × 1017 cm−3 for the samples treated with 1,10-phenanthroline, 4,4′-bipyridine, pyridine, and Bphen, respectively. Apparently, the results were again consistent with the previous data. 1,10-Phenanthroline and 4,4′-bipyridine could passivate the defects of the perovskite films more effectively than pyridine. Bphen was less effective presumably due to the presence of two phenyl groups. One should, however, note that the values of nt deduced from the hole-only devices showed two contributions: defects from the bulk and the surface because the hole transport was affected by both kinds of traps.

(f) The PL intensities at various excitation intensities of the samples before and after treatment with 1,10-phenanthroline. 
The changes in the trap densities were also determined by excitation dependence PL measurements. A very interesting phenomenon was observed. Fig. 5(f) shows the excitation dependence of the PL intensity of the CH3NH3PbBr3 films before and after treatment with 1,10-phenanthroline. The PL intensity of the treated thin films gradually increased with the increasing excitation power. In the reference sample, the PL intensity increased slowly, suggesting a higher level of traps existing in the thin film without surface treatments. More interestingly, when the power was over 150 μW, it suddenly deviated from the original power dependence and became much stronger. This is probably due to the fact that most of the defects were filled and the PL dependence entered the other region.22 Overall, the excitation dependence of the PL intensities also supported the occurrence of passivation effects.
To study the possible structural changes upon surface treatments, the perovskite films were investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Fig. 6 shows the top-view SEM images of the perovskite sample after various surface treatments; the low-magnification SEM micrographs are also shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). From the SEM images, we observed that the top surface consisted of many tiny crystals of CH3NH3PbBr3. We, however, could not distinguish the differences between these top surfaces in terms of crystal density and size. Furthermore, the X-ray diffraction patterns revealed different X-ray intensities [Fig. 2(b)]; a magnified XRD spectrum is shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). After surface treatment with 1,10-phenanthroline and 4,4′-bipyridine, the intensities at 15.0° and 30.2°, which are assigned to the (100) and (200) crystal planes of CH3NH3PbBr3, respectively, were both increased, suggesting that their crystallinity was apparently enhanced after the treatments. Although the entire process is not fully understood yet, the result of the XRD pattern seems to support that 1,10-phenanthroline and 4,4′-bipyridine were very effective passivating ligands.

PeLEDs were fabricated using the structure: ITO/PEDOT:PSS/VB-FNPD/CH3NH3PbBr3/TPBi/Ag, where the cross-linked hole-transporting material, VB-FNPD, was adopted to improve the hole injection/transport ability.23 The electrical properties of the PeLEDs treated with various passivating ligands are shown in Fig. 7. For the device prepared without surface treatments (the reference device), the light turn-on voltage (VT), defined for a luminance of 1 cd m−2, however, was ca. 3.4 V [Fig. 7(a)]. The maximum brightness of the reference device was 580 cd m−2 and the peak efficiency was ca. 0.1 cd A−1 [Fig. 7(b)]. After treatment with pyridine, the maximum brightness increased to 680 cd m−2 and the peak efficiency improved to 0.25 cd A−1. While the passivating ligand was 1,10-phenanthroline, the highest brightness was significantly increased to almost 1150 cd m−2 and the current efficiency was also improved to 0.27 cd A−1, which was about two-fold improvement as compared with that of the reference device. The device characteristics reflected the decreased level of traps after surface passivation.

Conclusions
In summary, we have investigated the passivation effects of aromatic bidentate chelating ligands on the properties of perovskite thin films. The results of steady-state PL, TRPL, and hole-only diodes indicated that the traps of CH3NH3PbBr3 thin films could be effectively passivated after post-deposition surface treatment with bidentate chelating ligands, including 1,10-phenanthroline and 4,4′-bipyridine. We inferred that the unsaturated or under-coordinated Pb ions, which were considered as electronic traps, could effectively react with bidentate chelating ligands. In particular, the lower passivation ability of Bphen, which consisted of two additional phenyl groups, suggested that the steric hindrance effect probably affected the surface passivation reactions. As compared with mono-dentate chelating pyridine, bidentate chelating ligands were more active. This is probably due to the higher entropy resulting from the coordination reactions between the under-coordinated Pb ions and/or Pb clusters and the bidentate chelating ligands. We note that more studies should be conducted to confirm these assumptions. Finally, PeLEDs were fabricated and the device passivated with 1,10-phenanthroline exhibited a nearly doubled efficiency. We anticipate that aromatic bidentate chelating ligands could be a promising choice for general passivating agents to fix the defects of perovskite materials and, eventually, to improve the performance of perovskite electronic devices.
