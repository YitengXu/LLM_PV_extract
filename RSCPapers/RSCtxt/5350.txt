    , Accepted 14th April 2021First published on 20th April 2021AbstractThe all-inorganic perovskite CsPbIBr2 is a promising material in the photovoltaic (PV) field due to its acceptable optical bandgap and favorable air-stable phase stability. However, the conventional solution-processed poor-coverage thin films make it a challenging task to prepare high-performance solar cells. In this work, we introduce cadmium ions (Cd2+) into CsPbIBr2 perovskite and investigate how this doping treatment would affect the PV performance of the carbon-based CsPbIBr2 all-inorganic perovskite solar cells (FTO/SnO2/CsPbIBr2/carbon). We found that the crystallinity and morphology of CsPbIBr2 thin films are significantly improved after Cd2+ doping, leading to improved light absorption and carrier transportation with reduced carrier recombination in perovskites. The optimized device achieved the highest efficiency of 6.79% in comparison with 4.36% for the device without Cd2+ doping, an increase of 56% in efficiency. Meanwhile, the optimized device with Cd2+ doping exhibited enhanced stability (76% of initial efficiency after 10 hours) in ambient atmosphere. Furthermore, the whole fabrication process of these devices is performed at low temperatures, not more than 160 °C. The present work provides a simple and economical strategy for the fabrication of low-temperature-processed CsPbIBr2 solar cells and the improvement in their performance.
1. Introduction
Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite materials have gained tremendous attention owing to their outstanding optoelectronic properties such as suitable bandgaps,1,2 long carrier diffusion lengths,3 and high extinction coefficients.4,5 To date, the champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has been booming and reached 25.5%,6 comparable to that of silicon-based solar cells. However, the thermal and moisture instabilities of intrinsic organic components (e.g., CH3NH3+ and (NH2)2CH+) in the state-of-the-art hybrid perovskites cause the stability problems of PSCs, which severely hinder their potential commercialization.7 Alternatively, inorganic cesium (Cs+) cations are introduced to substitute the organic components and the inorganic halide perovskite (CsPbX3, X = I, Br and Cl) has been a hot topic of research due to its dramatically improved thermal stability (>300 °C).8,9 Among the CsPbX3 family, the early researched CsPbI3 is the most ideal perovskite material as it possesses a narrow bandgap (1.73 eV).10,11 Unfortunately, its cubic perovskite phase would quickly degrade to the non-perovskite phase (δ-CsPbI3) in ambient atmosphere. CsPbBr3 shows superior phase stability but the wide bandgap (2.38 eV) forces its light absorption edge to ∼540 nm, resulting in the limitation of developing high-performance PSCs.12,13 Interestingly, CsPbIBr2 exhibits a satisfactory ambient stability, and its acceptable bandgap of 2.05 eV can ensure the relatively sufficient light absorption as well as the application of CsPbIBr2-based PSCs in tandem solar cells.14–16 Hence, CsPbIBr2 turns out to be a promising active material in PSCs.
A high-quality perovskite thin film is undoubtedly essential to prepare high-performance PSCs. However, according to the previous reports, the inorganic CsPbIBr2 films deposited using the conventional solution-processed methods usually contain many pinholes and massive grain boundaries, which easily lead to charge nonradiative recombination thus affecting the device's photoelectric properties.17–19 To date, enormous efforts, such as intermolecular exchange strategy,20 aging solution21 and interfacial engineering,22,23 have proved useful for obtaining high-quality CsPbIBr2 films without pinholes and cracks. Also, a convenient and effective element doping strategy, such as alkali cations (Li+, Na+, K+ and Rb+) doped into the Cs-site of CsPbI2Br and CsPbBr3 perovskites,24,25 and transition metal ions (Mn2+, Ni2+, Cu2+ and Zn2+) and lanthanide ions (Sm3+, Tb3+, Ho3+, Er3+ and Yb3+) doped into the Pb-site of CsPbBr3,26,27 confirmed conducive to enlarging grain sizes with fewer grain boundaries, thus improving the PCE value. These doping strategies have also attracted widespread attention in CsPbIBr2 PSCs. For instance, Liao's group used Li+ to partially substitute the Cs-sites in CsPbIBr2; the highly crystallized and well-oriented CsPbIBr2 films with enhanced grain sizes were obtained, and the Li-doped devices delivered an improved PCE of 9.25%.28 Similarly, by incorporating Sn2+ ions into the CsPbIBr2 films, homogeneous and densely crystallized films with tunable bandgaps were obtained.29 Mn2+ ions doped in the CsPbIBr2 films could reduce energy loss in hole transfer and facilitate the charge-transfer process, thus realizing a PCE value of 7.36%.30 Ba2+ ions were incorporated into the CsPbIBr2 films to increase the grain size, suppress carrier recombination, and achieve an improved PCE of 10.51%.31 However, plenty of efforts still need to be made to prepare high-quality CsPbIBr2 films and improve the final device performance. Besides, most of the high-performance PSCs commonly use expensive organic hole transport materials (HTMs), novel mental electrodes and high annealing temperature (>200 °C) treatment, which would significantly increase the cell cost and fabrication process.
In this work, cadmium ions (Cd2+) with a smaller ionic radius than Pb2+ were doped into the CsPbIBr2 perovskite lattice for the first time. We demonstrated that Cd2+ partially substituted for Pb2+ in the lattice could have a positive effect on improving the performance and stability of CsPbIBr2 PSCs. By optimizing the Cd2+ doping concentration, highly crystallized CsPbIBr2 films with enlarged grain size as well as improved photoelectric properties were obtained. Consequently, under a low fabrication temperature of 160 °C, carbon-based and low-temperature-processed CsPbIBr2 PSCs with optimized Cd2+ doping exhibited a champion PCE of 6.79% and a high open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.19 V. Furthermore, the moisture stability of the devices with optimized Cd2+ doping is greatly improved compared with the reference device without Cd2+ doping.
2. Experimental
2.1 Materials
Lead(II) bromide (PbBr2, 99.99%) and cesium iodide (CsI, 99.99%) were purchased from Xi’an Polymer Light Technology. Dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO, 99.8%) and cadmium iodide (CdI2, 99.5%) were purchased from Aladdin, and the SnO2 colloidal solution (15 wt% in water) was purchased from Alfa Aesar. Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrates (15 Ω) were received from Huanan Xiangcheng Science and Technology Co., Ltd. The commercial conductive carbon paste was purchased from Shanghai MaterWin New Materials Co., Ltd. All these chemicals and reagents were directly used without any further purification.
2.2 Device fabrication
The FTO-coated substrates with a size of 2 × 2 cm2 were sequentially ultrasonically washed with detergent, deionized water, acetone and anhydrous alcohol for 20 min, successively. After drying in a nitrogen flow, these cleaned FTO substrates were further treated under oxygen plasma for 15 min. Then, SnO2 colloidal solution (15 wt%) was diluted in deionized water and was spun on the precleaned FTO substrates at 4000 rpm for 30 s, followed by annealing in the open air at 150 °C for 30 min. Thus, the SnO2-based electron transport layer (ETL) was formed. Next, the 1 M CsPbIBr2 precursor solution was deposited on the FTO/SnO2 substrates at 600 rpm for 5 s and 3000 rpm for 45 s. The above samples were annealed at 160 °C for 10 min. The CsPbIBr2 precursor solution was obtained by fully dissolving 260 mg of CsI and 367 mg of PbBr2 in 1 mL of DMSO. For the Cd-incorporated CsPbIBr2 precursor, CdI2 with various concentrations (0.25%, 0.5%, and 1% molar ratios to PbBr2) were added to the CsPbIBr2 precursor solution. Finally, the carbon black electrode was deposited on each CsPbIBr2 film by coating conductive carbon paste using the doctor-blade technology, followed by a heat treatment at 120 °C for 10 min. The active area of each device was 0.12 cm2.
2.3 Characterization
The patterns of the samples were studied using an X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Bruker D8 Advance) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å). The X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were recorded using an ESCALAB 250Xi XPS system (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Surface morphologies of the films were analysed using a field emission scanning electron microscope (SEM, Gemini 300). Photoluminescence spectra (PL) were recorded using a fluorescence spectrometer (Hitachi, F7000). Time-resolved PL spectra (TRPL) were recorded using an FLS1000 spectrometer (Edinburgh Instruments Ltd), and a picosecond pulsed diode laser (405 nm) was used as the excitation source. UV-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra were recorded using a UV-vis NIR spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer, Lambda 35). The J–V curves of the CsPbIBr2 PSCs were obtained using a Keithley 2400 source meter under AM 1.5G illumination at 100 mW cm−2 (Newport Oriel Sol3A), which was calibrated using a standard silicon solar cell. External quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements were performed using a Quantum Efficiency measurement system (QE-R, EnliTech) in the 300–700 nm wavelength range. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were conducted with an electrochemical workstation (CHI760E) under dark conditions. The frequency range was between 0.1 Hz and 1 MHz with a fixed bias of 0.5 V.
3. Results and discussion
For convenience, different Cd2+ doping contents of the corresponding CsPbIBr2 films or PSCs are labeled as x%-Cd (x = 0, 0.25, 0.5 and 1). Fig. 1a presents the comparative XRD patterns of the CsPbIBr2 films with various Cd2+ doping concentrations prepared using a simple one-step solution method and a low annealing temperature (160 °C) in a nitrogen glove box. The core diffraction peaks at 14.82°, 21.09° and 30.03° were assigned to the (100), (110) and (200) crystal planes of the α-phase CsPbIBr2 perovskite structure, respectively.18,22,32 Furthermore, the CsPbIBr2 film with 0.5%-Cd exhibits the highest peak intensity, indicating the improved crystallinity in the CsPbIBr2 film. Fig. 1b presents the enlarged XRD peaks of (100) and (200) crystal planes; it can be seen that both XRD peaks of the (100) and (200) planes shift to a higher 2θ after Cd2+ incorporation. These shifts can be explained by the differences in the ionic radius between the Cd2+ and Pb2+ ions. Specifically, the Cd2+ ions (∼95 pm) have a smaller radius than the Pb2+ ions (∼119 pm), and they partially substitute Pb2+ in the CsPbIBr2 lattice, thus leading to the shrinkage of the perovskite lattice. The decreased Pb contents in perovskites could increase the tolerance factor, which may improve the stability of the perovskite structure.33 In addition, the CsPbIBr2 film with 0.5%-Cd has the narrowest full width at half maximum (FWHM) of both the (100) diffraction peaks (Fig. 1c). These results demonstrate that Cd2+ doping is beneficial for improving the crystallinity of CsPbIBr2 films. Fig. 1d presents the schematic diagram of the CsPbIBr2 lattice after the Cd2+ ions partially substitute the Pb2+ ions.

Fig. 2a–d show the surface morphology of the CsPbIBr2 film with Cd-x% (x = 0, 0.25, 0.5 and 1), where all films exhibit a dense and uniform surface. However, in the CsPbIBr2 film illustrated in Fig. 2a, a rough film with small grains can be observed, and even some pinholes can be observed in it. With the introduction of Cd2+ doping, the CsPbIBr2 films present a flat and full-coverage surface with increased grain sizes, especially for the CsPbIBr2 film with 0.5%-Cd as shown in Fig. 2c. But when the doping concentration reached 1%, a bad film morphology with some pinholes appeared again, indicating that excessive doping could damage the perovskite structure. Accordingly, the average grain sizes were 390 nm, 420 nm, 580 nm and 430 nm for the pure CsPbIBr2 film (0%-Cd), CsPbIBr2 film with 0.25%-Cd, CsPbIBr2 film with 0.5%-Cd and CsPbIBr2 film with 1%-Cd (Fig. S1, ESI†), respectively. At the same time, the cross-sectional SEM images display a perpendicular perovskite overlayer with a film thickness of approximately 250 nm (Fig. S2, ESI†). Such enlarged grain size and pinhole-free film morphology as well as a perpendicular perovskite grain arrangement structure can reduce the nonradiative recombination of charge carriers in perovskites, which helps to improve the efficiency of the devices.34–36 Fig. S3 (ESI†) presents the energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectra of the CsPbIBr2 film with 0.5%-Cd, where all elements including Cs, Pb, I, Br and Cd are evenly distributed in it, confirming the existence of Cd2+ in the CsPbIBr2 film with 0.5%-Cd.

The UV-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra of the CsPbIBr2 films with various Cd2+ concentrations are displayed in Fig. 3a. The absorbance of the CsPbIBr2 films with Cd-0.5% is higher than that of the pure CsPbIBr2 films and also shows the highest absorbance among the various Cd2+ concentrations. This phenomenon can be attributed to the improved crystallinity of the perovskite film after Cd2+ doping.37 Besides, all four samples have identical absorption onset at ∼605 nm, corresponding to a bandgap of ∼2.05 eV calculated from the Tauc plots (Fig. 3b). This result is consistent with the previous studies on CsPbIBr2.38

Photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved PL measurements are performed to illuminate the carrier dynamics in the CsPbIBr2 films deposited on glass substrates. Fig. 3b presents the PL spectra of the CsPbIBr2 films with different Cd2+ concentrations. It can be seen that four kinds of CsPbIBr2 films have similar PL peaks at ∼605 nm, which well matches the measured bandgap obtained from the absorbance spectra (Fig. 3a). Compared with the pure CsPbIBr2 (0%-Cd) film, the CsPbIBr2 film with 0.5%-Cd has the highest PL intensity, indicating the reduced carrier recombination in it. Fig. 3c shows the TRPL spectra of the corresponding films. These TRPL decay curves are fitted by using a biexponential decay function y = A1exp(−t/τ1) + A2exp(−t/τ2) + y0,39 where the fast decay component (τ1) is usually linked with the nonradiative recombination induced by defect trapping and the slow one (τ2) is linked with radiative recombination of free carriers.39 The weighted average value is defined as the average carrier lifetime (τave), which is calculated using the following function:  (i = 1, 2). The calculated τave is 1.50 ns, 2.58 ns, 6.22 ns and 1.57 ns for the pure CsPbIBr2 film, CsPbIBr2 film with 0.25%-Cd, CsPbIBr2 film with 0.5%-Cd and CsPbIBr2 film with 1%-Cd, respectively. The detailed TRPL parameters are listed in Table S1 (ESI†). There is no doubt that the CsPbIBr2 film with 0.5%-Cd presents the longest average lifetime of 6.22 ns, four times that of the pure CsPbIBr2 film (1.50 ns). The enhanced carrier lifetime proved that the defect densities in the CsPbIBr2 films are drastically reduced after Cd2+ doping, which restrains carrier nonradiative recombination, thus contributing to the performance of the corresponding devices.
To identify whether Cd2+ doping can change the chemical states of the CsPbIBr2 films, XPS characterization was performed. We calibrated each peak based on C 1s (284.8 eV). The new binding energy peak at around 406.5 eV appeared in the CsPbIBr2 film with 0.5%-Cd (Fig. S4, ESI†), indicating that Cd 3d can be detected and the existence of Cd2+ in the CsPbIBr2 film as well.40Fig. 4a–e show the Cs 3d, Pb 4f, I 3d, and Br 3d core-level spectra and XPS survey spectra, respectively. Notably, in the CsPbIBr2 films with 0.5%-Cd, all core peaks are slightly shifted to lower binding energies in contrast to the pure CsPbIBr2 films without Cd2+ doping. As neither physical mixing41 nor a slight fluctuation in the I/Br ratio in the mixed halide perovskite42 can change the chemical states, the shifts are ascribed to the influence of Cd2+ doping, indicating that Cd2+ successfully entered the CsPbIBr2 crystal lattice.30 In detail, the radius of Cd2+ is smaller than that of Pb2+, and the replacement of Pb2+ with Cd2+ results in the volume contraction of the BX6 (B = Pb or Cd, X = I or Br) octahedra and the binding energy shift of the core peaks, which are also consistent with the XRD results in this study.

In addition, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurements were utilized to study the effect of Cd2+ incorporation on the band alignment of the CsPbIBr2 films. Fig. 5a and b show the secondary electron cutoff energy and the valence band maximum (VBM) onset of the CsPbIBr2 films with x%-Cd, respectively. The VBM value is calculated using the following equation: VBM = 21.22 eV − (Ecutoff − Eonset).43 The calculated VBM values for the pure CsPbIBr2 films, CsPbIBr2 films with 0.25%-Cd, CsPbIBr2 films with 0.5%-Cd and CsPbIBr2 films with 1%-Cd are −6.07 eV, −5.93 eV, −5.74 eV and −5.96 eV, respectively. In combination with the bandgap values (∼2.05 eV) of the perovskite films obtained from the UV-vis absorption spectra and the bandgap (∼3.49 eV) of SnO2 referenced from the literature,44 the corresponding energy band structure diagrams and data details are obtained and summarized in Fig. 5c and Table S2 (ESI†), respectively. Taking the pure CsPbIBr2 films and the CsPbIBr2 films with 0.5%-Cd as examples, the energy differences between the VBM values of the CsPbIBr2 films and the carbon electrode decrease from 1.07 eV to 0.74 eV, implying a smaller energy loss during hole transfer from the perovskite to the carbon electrode. Meanwhile, the band minimum (CBM) upshifts from its initial −4.02 eV to −3.69 eV after Cd2+ doping. This upshift can provide an enhanced driving force to inject electrons from the perovskite to the SnO2 electron transport layer, which is helpful for the photocurrent.43,45

In order to investigate the effects of Cd2+ doping on the photovoltaic properties of the CsPbIBr2 PSCs, as shown in Fig. 6a, we fabricated devices with a planar heterojunction structure of FTO/SnO2/CsPbIBr2/carbon, where the CsPbIBr2 is the light absorption layer, SnO2 is the electron transport layer (ETL) and the carbon electrode acts as both the hole transport layer (HTL) and the anode in PSCs. The cross-sectional SEM image of the carbon-based CsPbIBr2 PSC device is presented in Fig. 6b, in which a layered structure can be clearly identified. The thickness of the CsPbIBr2 film is approximately 250 nm, which is close to those of the reported studies.29,30 The best-performed current density–voltage (J–V) curves for the CsPbIBr2 PSCs with x%-Cd are shown in Fig. 6c and the detailed photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 1. In Fig. 6c, the pure CsPbIBr2 PSCs yielded a PCE of 4.36% with a Jsc of 8.56 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.99 V, and an FF of 0.54. When Cd2+ doping was introduced, the CsPbIBr2 PSCs with 0.25%-Cd gained a PCE of 6.65% with a Voc of 1.17 V, a Jsc of 9.26 mA cm−2, and an FF of 0.61. The CsPbIBr2 PSCs with 0.5%-Cd showed the highest PCE of 6.79%, with a Voc of 1.19 V, a relatively high Jsc of 9.76 mA cm−2 and an FF of 0.57, displaying a 56% PCE enhancement as compared with the CsPbIBr2 PSCs without Cd2+ doping. The enhancement of Jsc, Voc and PCE was mainly attributed to the improved film morphology after Cd2+ doping. The CsPbIBr2 PSCs with 1%-Cd exhibited a decreased PCE of 5.48%, indicating that excessive Cd2+ doping would aggravate device performance. The statistical PCEs (15 devices) of the CsPbIBr2 PSCs and the CsPbIBr2 PSCs with 0.5%-Cd are presented in Fig. S5 (ESI†), and the average PCEs obtained are 4.05% and 6.15%, respectively, meaning that these devices show good reproducibility. Besides, different cell configurations, fabrication methods and performance comparisons of the CsPbIBr2 PSCs are summarized in Table S3. Our work presents a relatively satisfactory PCE among these devices, especially in the carbon-based CsPbIBr2 PSCs devices.

Fig. 6d shows the corresponding EQE spectra, where four different devices exhibit optical responses with a wavelength range of 300–600 nm, which is consistent with the absorption edge shown in Fig. 3b. Furthermore, across the optical response range, the CsPbIBr2 PSCs with Cd2+ doping exhibited improved EQE values and achieved the highest value of 79.01% compared to the device (69.45%) without Cd2+ doping. The improved EQE value facilitates the enhancement of the photoelectric conversion properties. Besides, it ought to be carefully noted that the integrated Jsc values calculated from the EQE spectrum are 7.95, 8.48, 8.63, and 8.55 mA cm−2 for the CsPbIBr2 PSCs with 0%-Cd, 0.25%-Cd, 0.5%-Cd, and 1%-Cd, respectively, which match closely with the measured Jsc values, indicating the accuracy of the PCE measurements.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were employed to investigate the interfacial carrier recombination in devices. The Nyquist plots of the CsPbIBr2 PSCs with x%-Cd are shown in Fig. 6e, in which the inset is the equivalent circuit model used for fitting, and Rrec is the carrier recombination resistant.46 Generally, a lower Rs relates to better electron transport and a larger Rrec suggests a lower recombination rate.47 According to Fig. 6e, the CsPbIBr2 PSCs with 0.5%-Cd have the largest carrier Rrec among all samples, indicating the reduced carrier recombination in the CsPbIBr2 PSCs with 0.5%-Cd,48 which is consistent with the PL and TRPL results of this study. Thus, all these contribute to improving the photovoltaic performance of the devices.
Finally, we have also tested the ambient stability of the pure CsPbIBr2 PSCs and the CsPbIBr2 PSCs with 0.5%-Cd placed in air under a relative humidity of ∼55% for 10 h without encapsulation. The change of PCE, Voc, Jsc and FF versus time is presented in Fig. 7a–d, in which the CsPbIBr2 PSCs with 0.5%-Cd maintained approximately 76% of their original efficiency after 10 h of storage, while the pure CsPbIBr2 PSCs only maintained 55% of their original efficiency. The above results demonstrate that Cd2+-doping can enhance the stability of PSCs in ambient air, mainly due to the improved film morphology with reduced defects.

4. Conclusion
In summary, Cd2+ doping was introduced to prepare CsPbIBr2 films and the corresponding carbon-based CsPbIBr2 all-inorganic perovskite solar cells. XRD and SEM measurements confirmed that Cd2+ doping is beneficial to obtain highly crystallized CsPbIBr2 films with full coverage, flat morphology and expanded grain sizes. UV-vis, PL, TRPL, EIS and UPS characterization demonstrated that the CsPbIBr2 films with 0.5%-Cd exhibited enhanced light harvesting, reduced trap states, extended carrier lifetime and an optimized energy-level structure. Accordingly, a champion PCE of 6.79% was obtained for the CsPbIBr2 PSCs with 0.5%-Cd, which was 56% higher than that achieved for the pure CsPbIBr2 PSCs. Meanwhile, the device with 0.5%-Cd showed excellent ambient stability compared with the reference device without Cd2+ doping. This work provides a facile and economical strategy for improving the efficiency and stability of low-temperature-processed CsPbIBr2 PSCs.
