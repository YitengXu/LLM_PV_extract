Nevertheless, dialysis limits the size separation of GQDs with a diverse range of size. Furthermore, this technique typically takes several days, entails high cost, and requires additional steps for the removal of excess amount of solvent. Thus, there is a need to develop an efficient and facile strategy for the synthesis of GQDs of various sizes.Herein, we report a simple and reliable approach for fabricating well-defined and low size distribution GQDs based on the oxidation of herringbone-type carbon nanofibers (HCNFs) and size-selective precipitation. This novel and facile approach describes the tailoring of PL emission of GQDs by varying the oxidation temperature and sedimentation velocity, which effectively produced GQDs of varying sizes. Additionally, the upconversion properties of GQD were determined and the response mechanism of the upconversion GQD-layer-modified working electrode in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) was investigated.The overall synthetic procedure for GQDs is shown in Scheme 1. Under our experimental conditions, HCNFs with diameters of 50–100 nm were used as the starting material. The small domain structure of sp2 carbon atoms, such as those in carbon nanofibers (CNFs), has advantages of easy extraction and facile size control of the synthesized GQDs.4a The HCNFs were oxidized under excessive acidic conditions for 24 h and exfoliated to nanometer-sized graphene oxides. The oxidation process was carried out at temperatures ranging from 80 to 120 °C to synthesize GQDs. Then, the pH of the solution was adjusted to 8 using Na2CO3. To enhance the PL intensities of GQDs by surface passivation, the surface edges of graphene oxide sheets were anchored with polyethylene glycol (PEG, MW: 10000).5 The anchoring process was performed at 120 °C for 1 h via a hydrothermal method. Then, size-selective precipitation was used to isolate the GQDs from the reaction mixture. Ethanol, a non-solvent, was added to the concentrated solution until the Na2SO4 salts started to precipitate. Excess Na+ and SO42− ions were present in the GQD solution due to the neutralization reaction between H2SO4 and Na2CO3; the excess ions combined to form Na2SO4 salts in a non-solvent system. From the resulting turbid solution, the precipitate and the supernatant were perfectly separated by centrifugation. Consequently, uniform nanometer-sized GQDs were separated from Na2SO4 salts and larger GQDs under various sedimentation velocity conditions. Scheme 1  Formation mechanism for the graphene quantum dots(GQDs) via size-selective precipitation procedures. Fig. 1a–e show transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of pristine HCNFs and GQDs at each size-selective precipitation step. The pristine HCNFs had diameters of ca. 50–100 nm (Fig. 1a). After excessive oxidation and PEG anchoring steps, the as-synthesized GQDs had diameters of ca. 5–40 nm with a broad size distribution (Fig. 1b). After each separation step, the supernatant and precipitate showed significant differences in morphology and in the size of the GQDs (Fig. 1c and d). The size distributions measured using TEM were ca. 5–40 nm and ca. 5–15 nm for the precipitate and supernatant, respectively. Namely, the supernatant after the separation process exhibited a uniform morphology and a narrow size distribution compared with that of the precipitate. Fig. 1e shows a high-resolution (HR)-TEM image of the edge structure of GQDs, in which zigzag edges were observed.4a,6 The corresponding fast Fourier transform (FFT) pattern is shown in the inset of Fig. 1e. From the two-dimensional FFT image, the GQD edges seem to be predominantly parallel to the zigzag orientation, although other orientations are also possible. The PL spectra of GQDs before and after size-selective precipitation were investigated (Fig. 1f). After the separation process, the emission peak of GQDs was blue-shifted by about 15 nm; the emission spectral width was narrow (20 nm) due to the uniform size and shape of the GQDs.

(e) HR-TEM image of the as-synthesized GQD (inset: the corresponding fast Fourier transform (FFT) pattern). (f) PL spectra of GQDs before and after the size-selective precipitation process. Discrete nanomaterials dispersed in a fluid exhibit a divergent sedimentation trend as a function of size, morphology, structure, and other properties.7 Thus, the predominant dispersion stability of smaller GQDs is attributable to the sedimentation velocity, which is an important factor in particle precipitation. Stoke's law, a formula for determining the rate of sedimentation, indicates that a particle moving through a viscous liquid attains a constant velocity or sedimentation rate. The equation for Stoke's law of sedimentation is as follows: Vg = d2(ρp − ρ1)/18η × G(1)where Vg is the sedimentation velocity, d is the particle diameter, ρp is the particle density, ρ1 is the liquid density, η is the viscosity of liquid, and G is the gravitational acceleration. Under our conditions, the sedimentation velocity (Vg) was 1.64 × 10−11 and 1.15 × 10−9 m s−1 for 10 and 40 nm GQDs, respectively (Table S1, ESI†). It is noteworthy that the Vg of 10 nm GQDs was ca. 70 times slower than that of 40 nm GQDs. It was also expected that the slower settling velocity of smaller GQD sheets and the limited formation of Na2SO4 salts on smaller GQD sheets would have a synergistic effect and enhance the anti-sedimentation properties.The synthesized GQDs possessed upconversion PL properties. As shown in Fig. 2a, when the excitation wavelength changed from 600 to 750 nm, an upconversion emission band was observed in the curve centered at ca. 525 nm. The upconversion PL properties of GQDs are attributable to multiphoton active processes, similar to previous reports on carbon dots.8 To test the energy transfer between the GQDs and the sensitizing D719 dye, the PL spectra of a mixture of GQDs and D719 dye in aqueous solution were obtained (Fig. 2b). Upconversion fluorescence spectra of GQDs excited at 750 nm were examined for D719 dye contents ranging from 0.062 to 0.286 mM. As the content of the dye molecules increased, the upconverted PL intensity decreased significantly. Additionally, the Stern–Volmer plot of the fluorescence quenching of GQD with an emission peak at 525 nm was investigated with respect to those of other light emitting GQDs (470 and 427 nm), as shown in Fig. 2c. The GQD (525 nm) shows a high quenching rate with the content of the dye, followed by GQD (470 nm) and GQD (427 nm). These results correspond to a larger degree of overlap between the donor fluorescence spectrum and the acceptor absorbance spectrum shown in Fig. 2d. Thus, a greater amount of light can be utilized by the D719 dye via the upconversion function of the GQDs and Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET).9 Fig. 2  (a) Upconverted PL spectra of the GQDs at different excitation wavelengths. (b) Fluorescence spectra of GQDs as a function of the amount of dye molecules from 62 to 286 μM. (c) Stern–Volmer plots of the fluorescence quenching of GQDs with the D719 dye. (d) Absorption spectra of GQDs as a function of the amount of dye molecules from 62 to 286 μM. For use as light-harvesting antennae in FRET based photovoltaic devices, GQDs were deposited onto the top of a TiO2 working electrode of DSSCs via spin coating.10 The photovoltaic performance (PV) of GQD-layer-modified DSSCs is shown in Fig. 3. When 2.6 mg of GQDs were incorporated into the DSSC, the power-conversion efficiency was enhanced to 7.95%, compared to 7.28% for pristine DSSCs. Notably, the optimized GQD-layer-modified DSSC showed ca. 9.2% enhanced efficiency compared with pristine DSSCs. Fig. 3b shows the incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) for DSSCs with and without GQDs. For the cells with GQDs, the response for wavelengths between 350 and 700 nm increased significantly compared with pristine DSSCs. The IPCE changed significantly for wavelengths less than 530 nm, corresponding to the overlap region of the donor emission spectrum and the acceptor absorption spectrum. Moreover, the high-wavelength bands at 850 nm increased with the addition of GQDs, which could be attributed to the upconverted PL of GQDs (Fig. 3b, inset). Thus, the GQD-layer-modified photoanode provides enhanced DSSC performance and offers new possibilities for realizing FRET based DSSCs for a wide range of wavelengths by incorporating GQDs. Fig. 3  (a) J–V characteristics (under simulated AM 1.5 irradiation) of the cells with and without GQDs (inset: the photocurrent density as a function of the amount of deposited GQDs). (b) IPCE of the cells with and without GQDs (inset: high magnification spectra in IPCE). In conclusion, highly luminescent GQDs with various sizes were successfully fabricated by oxidation of HCNFs and size-selective precipitation. Most importantly, the facile size-selective precipitation process quickly separated nanometer-sized GQDs from the bulk GQD solution without a time-consuming dialysis process. Furthermore, the synthesized GQDs exhibited excellent upconversion properties, and proved to be a feasible candidate for a phosphor in photovoltaic devices to enhance the light-harvesting ability in the long-wavelength range. This novel approach could be used as an alternative method for fabrication of various GQD based photovoltaic devices with rational nanostructure design.This work was supported by the Global Frontier R&D Program on Center for Multiscale Energy System funded by the National Research Foundation under the Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning, Korea (2011-0031573).Notes and references
