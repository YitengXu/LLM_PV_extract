    , Accepted 28th May 2019First published on 30th May 2019AbstractOrganic solar cells based on π-conjugated small molecules (SM-OSCs) have developed rapidly in the past few years. Nevertheless, the design strategies of small-molecule (SM) donors for high-efficiency SM-OSCs require further improvement. Halogenation is an effective way to modulate their electronic properties, and to date, fluorination has been most widely used for the design of organic photovoltaic materials. However, the feasibility and utility of photovoltaic materials incorporating other halogens, especially heavier bromine and iodine, have not been fully explored. Here, a novel family of SM donor materials, having the same π-conjugated backbone but different terminal halogen groups (F, Cl, Br, and I), are systematically designed and developed. Furthermore, the structure–property–function relationships stemming from the variations in the substituted halogen atoms are discussed. Among these end-halogenated SM donors, the I-containing material shows remarkably high photovoltaic performance in the fullerene-based SM-OSCs, demonstrating power conversion efficiencies of up to 9.2% without any processing additives and post-treatment processes. Detailed morphological analyses reveal that end-halogenation with heavier halogen atoms, typified by I and Br, effectively modulated the interfacial free energy of the blend with a fullerene acceptor and facilitate the formation of fine interpenetrating networks in the active layer. This study establishes a new design paradigm featuring end-halogenation for producing high-performance photovoltaic materials for SM-OSCs.
Introduction
With increasing renewable energy demands for a sustainable future, organic solar cells (OSCs) are an emerging energy conversion technology owing to their potential advantages such as low cost, light weight, mechanical flexibility, solution processability, and facile large-area manufacturing.1,2 Advances in synthetic chemistry for producing diverse and useful π-conjugated molecular scaffolds have led to a sharp increase in the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of OSCs in the last decade. Solution-processed OSCs are typically based on bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) architectures comprising a blend of p-type (electron donor) and n-type (electron acceptor) organic semiconductors. The PCEs of single-junction polymer:fullerene-based OSCs have exceeded 11%,3 and nowadays, those of polymer:nonfullerene-based devices have caught up and reached over 14%.4 In addition to recent innovations in such nonfullerene acceptor materials,5 a major breakthrough in the design of donor materials is of urgent need to further enhance the PCEs of OSCs and accelerate their practical applications.
π-Conjugated small-molecule (SM) donors,6,7 although less studied than their polymer counterparts thus far, have drawn increasing research interest because of their inherent advantages such as well-defined chemical structures without molecular weight distribution, precise tunability of energy levels, and excellent reproducibility in photovoltaic performance. These features motivated us to study the structure–property–function relationships in SM donors, as their performance strongly depends on the component chemical structures. For the design of SM donors, the use of π-conjugated acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) electronic systems, combining a central electron-donating core (D) and two terminal electron-withdrawing units (A), is currently considered as one of the most promising structural motifs.7–21 For instance, benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b']dithiophene (BDT)8–19 and oligothiophene20 have been extensively utilized as the central D unit and rhodanine derivatives as the terminal A units in high-performing SM donors. With proper device engineering and optimizations, the PCEs of state-of-the-art single-junction OSCs employing these SM donors have progressed beyond 11%,11,14,16,17 closing upon those of polymer-based devices. While the design and combination of the D and A components are crucial, effective building units that are eligible for SM donors are very limited, and versatile design guidelines are still lacking.
Halogenation22 is a powerful strategy to modulate the energy levels, BHJ morphologies, and eventually photovoltaic performances in OSCs. In particular, replacing hydrogen atoms with fluorine (F) atoms, the most electronegative element, has been applied to a wide variety of semiconducting polymers3,4,23–25 and recently a few SM donors.11,26 At present, record-high PCEs of polymer-based OSCs have been achieved by using fluorinated polymer donors.3,4 This backbone fluorination can down-shift the energy levels of both the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of polymer donors without causing large steric hindrance, and thereby increase the open-circuit voltages (Voc) of the resulting devices. Additionally, due to noncovalent F⋯H, F⋯S, and F⋯π interactions, fluorination can enhance the intermolecular interactions, which contribute to the improvements in crystallinity, film morphology, and charge-transport properties. Meanwhile, some research groups have recently begun to investigate whether halogenation (mostly focused on fluorination or chlorination) on the nonfullerene ladder-type acceptors can further improve the photovoltaic properties,4b,27 as it does for the foregoing polymer donors. To date, however, systematic studies on photovoltaic materials incorporating different halogen substituents, apart from F atoms, in the π-conjugated backbones are really rare.4c,26a,27d,e Although considerably lesser attention has been given to the introduction of heavier/larger bromine (Br) or iodine (I) atoms, it is of great interest to investigate the variations in the physicochemical and photovoltaic properties of SM donors substituted with a series of the halogen atoms.
In this work, to reveal how the systematic halogenation affects the resultant material properties and device performance, we designed and synthesized a novel family of SM donor materials, namely, BDT-ID-Xs (X = H, F, Cl, Br, and I for 1–5; Fig. 1). These molecules had identical π-conjugated backbones, consisting of a central BDT core and two peripheral 1,3-indandione (ID) units tethered by π-conjugated bithiophene linkers with alkyl side chains,19 but different terminal halogen substituents in the ID units. With this unique SM donor family, the halogenation effect on the photovoltaic performances of 1–5 blended with [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) as the acceptor, as well as the derived morphological and charge-transport properties were systematically investigated and compared. Importantly, it was found that the SM-OSCs based on iodinated 5 achieved the highest PCE of 9.2%, which is markedly higher than those of the devices fabricated using the other end-halogenated 2–4 and nonhalogenated 1. Our results demonstrated that incorporating unexplored heavy halogen atoms (e.g., Br and I) is a viable and effective strategy for developing high-performance photovoltaic materials.

Results and discussion
Materials synthesis and characterization
The synthetic routes to the new SM donors 1–5 are described in Scheme 1,† and the detailed synthetic procedures including characterization data are provided in the ESI.† Compound 7 was prepared from 3,4′-dihexyl-2,2′-bithiophene in two steps through sequential bromination and Vilsmeier–Haack formylation, according to our recent report.19 Two-fold Stille coupling reactions between 7 and the distannyl-BDT (6) using Pd(PPh3)4 as the catalyst afforded dialdehyde 8 as the key precursor in 87% yield. Finally, Knoevenagel condensation reactions between 8 and ID (9-H) or 5-halo-IDs (9-Xs; X = F, Cl, Br, I) yielded 1–5 as black powdery solids. This synthetic approach is effective for the introduction of various halogen groups, including reactive Br and I groups, into π-extended molecules. All these target compounds were highly soluble in chlorinated solvents such as chloroform and chlorobenzene by virtue of six side chains, and successively purified by column chromatography and recycling preparative gel permeation chromatography (GPC) with 35–93% isolation yields. Note that, unlike 1, each material of end-halogenated 2–5 was obtained as a mixture of three inseparable isomers since the terminal halo-ID units were attached so as to form two local isomeric structures in the final condensation step. The chemical structures of 1–5 were verified by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and elemental analysis (ESI†).

The thermal properties of 1–5 were evaluated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) under a nitrogen atmosphere (ESI†). The decomposition temperatures with 5% weight loss were found to decrease in the order of 1 (Td = 384 °C) > 2 (378 °C) > 3 (375 °C) > 4 (363 °C) > 5 (346 °C); the observed trend is related to the lowering of the associated C–X bond dissociation energies.28 Nevertheless, the thermal stabilities of all these end-halogenated molecules were sufficiently high for OSC applications. It is also noted that the melting temperatures and associated transition enthalpies of 2–5 (Tm = 221–227 °C and ΔH = 25.4–28.7 kJ mol−1) were much higher than those of nonhalogenated 1 (Tm = 204 °C and ΔH = 23.2 kJ mol−1) in spite of having only subtle variations in the two atoms at the molecular termini. This result is indicative of stronger intermolecular interactions in end-halogenated 2–5.
Optical properties and electronic structures
The UV-vis absorption spectra of 1–5 in chloroform solutions and in solid thin films are depicted in Fig. 2a and b, and the relevant photophysical data are compiled in Table 1. In dilute solutions (Fig. 2a), all of these molecules showed very similar broad absorption bands below 650 nm, which were attributed to the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) transitions. Nonhalogenated 1 exhibited an absorption peak (λmax) at 542 nm in chloroform. Upon introducing halogen atoms, solutions of 2–5 presented slightly red-shifted λmax in the range of 548–556 nm. Relative to their solutions, the absorption spectra of 1–5 in the thin films showed obvious red-shifts of λmax with an appearance of pronounced vibronic peaks (Fig. 2b), suggesting enhanced intermolecular interactions in the solid state. Consequently, 1–5 showed nearly identical film absorption spectra, with λmax of 659–666 nm and absorption edges extending over 730 nm, corresponding to the optical bandgaps (Eg) of approximately 1.7 eV. The similar absorption profiles, maximum extinction coefficients, and bandgap energies of 1–5 imply that the variation in the halogen substituents had minimal effect on the electronic transition characteristics in this system.

In contrast, it was found that end-halogenation affected the molecular energy levels. We performed photoelectron yield spectroscopy to determine the HOMO energy levels (EHOMO; or ionization potentials) of 1–5 in the thin films (Fig. 2c). As listed in Table 1, the EHOMO values of end-halogenated 2–5 were measured to be −5.20 to −5.23 eV, which were over 0.1 eV lower than that of 1 (EHOMO = −5.10 eV). The low-lying EHOMO of all these SM donors would be beneficial to obtain higher Voc in the SM-OSCs because Voc is directly proportional to the energy offset between the EHOMO of the donor and the LUMO energy level (ELUMO; or electron affinity) of the acceptor. Likewise, the ELUMO of 2–5 showed a decline of ∼0.1 eV as compared to that of 1 because of the inductive electron-withdrawing effect and/or high polarizability of the halogen groups. Overall, end-halogenation simultaneously stabilized the EHOMO and ELUMO to nearly the same degree, thus having a lesser impact on the optical Eg values.
To further investigate the molecular geometries and electronic properties, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed for 1–5 at the B3LYP/3-21G* level. As can be seen from Fig. 3a, the five molecules exhibited very similar frontier orbital distributions together with comparable high-planar geometries owing to their identical π-conjugated backbone. For all molecules, the HOMO wave functions were delocalized over the BDT core and the neighboring bithiophene moieties; whereas the LUMO wave functions were primarily distributed around the ID units along with the bithiophene moieties and extend to the edge of the ID units. Despite the similar frontier orbital distributions, end-halogenated 2–5 presented slightly lower calculated EHOMO and ELUMO values as compared to 1. This trend is reasonably consistent with the foregoing optical experimental results. Moreover, the lowest excited singlet (S1) states of 1–5, which are dominated by the HOMO → LUMO transition, exhibited comparably large oscillator strengths (f = 2.06–2.14), leading to large extinction coefficients that are beneficial for the effective utilization of sunlight. For further comparison, we also calculated the electric dipole moments for each 2-thienylmethylene-ID fragment of 1–5 (Fig. 3b). As expected, the end-halogenated ID units possessed 2–3-fold larger local dipole moments (μ = 2.08–2.55 D)29 than the parent ID unit (μ = 0.85 D) along the π-conjugated backbones. Inducing large permanent dipoles can lead to a decrease in miscibility with nonhalogenated PC71BM, and simultaneously increase the domain purity within the D/A segregated BHJ morphologies when mixed with the PC71BM acceptor.

Photovoltaic performance
Solution-processed BHJ OSCs were fabricated employing 1–5 as SM donors and PC71BM as an acceptor, with an inverted device structure of indium tin oxide (ITO)/ZnO (30 nm)/PFN–Br/donor:PC71BM (ca. 70–80 nm)/MoOx (10 nm)/Ag (100 nm).30 The ZnO electron extraction layer was deposited on the ITO-coated substrates via a sol–gel method, in which the surface was treated with a conjugated polyelectrolyte, PFN–Br, as an interfacial layer to facilitate electron extraction.31 The BHJ active layer consisting of a donor:PC71BM binary blend was formed by spin-coating from their chloroform solutions. A thin layer of MoOx as a hole extraction layer and an Ag anode were subsequently vacuum-deposited on the active layer. In most reported OSCs, their BHJ active layer morphologies were generally optimized by using solvent additives such as 1,8-diiodooctane to enhance the photovoltaic performance. In the present systems, however, we have prepared the BHJ active layers without using any solvent additives or post-treatments such as thermal annealing and solvent vapor annealing, in order to elucidate the intrinsic properties and potential abilities of 1–5 as photovoltaic materials. This feature can offer significant advantages in terms of the simplicity of the fabrication processes and morphological stability of the OSC devices.
To attain the best photovoltaic performance, we first screened the donor:acceptor (D/A) blend ratios from 1:1 to 4:1; the optimal D/A blend ratios were found to be around 2:1 (w/w) for the five donor materials (ESI†). Fig. 4a shows the current density–voltage (J–V) curves for thus optimized SM-OSCs based on 1–5:PC71BM (2:1, w/w) under simulated AM 1.5G illumination. The detailed photovoltaic parameters are given in Table 2 for a clear comparison. The nonhalogenated 1-based devices showed a relatively low maximum PCE of 5.9% in spite of its high short-circuit current density (Jsc) of ∼14 mA cm−2, which primarily originated from a low fill factor (FF) of ∼44%. Intriguingly, however, the FF values of the SM-OSCs featuring end-halogenated donors (2–5) were found to drastically increase (by more than 20%) at the slight expense of Jsc. Besides, the Voc remained unchanged and retained high values of 0.94–0.95 V, regardless of the variation of the halogen substituents. As a result, the highest PCEs of up to 9.2% (9.0% on average) were achieved for the iodinated 5-based devices, with Jsc of 14.2 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.94 V, and FF of 68%. However, the introduction of Br, Cl, and F atoms instead of I atoms in the terminal ID units led to a gradual decrease in the Jsc values with respect to that of 5, resulting in lowering the maximum PCEs in the order of iodinated 5 (9.2%) > brominated 4 (8.2%) > chlorinated 3 (7.4%) ≈ fluorinated 2 (7.5%). The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra for these SM-OSCs are shown in Fig. 4b. In comparison with the 2–4-based devices, the 1- and 5-based ones apparently exhibited better photon-to-current responses over the entire wavelength range between 350 and 700 nm, thereby contributing to their improved Jsc values. For 1-based device, the Jsc value was lower than the current density estimated from the integration of the EQE spectrum (Table 2). This can be attributed to inferior exciton dissociation and charge collection characteristics in the nonhalogenated 1:PC71BM BHJ system, as will be discussed later.

Charge generation, recombination, and transport characteristics
Considering the nearly same photoabsorption coverage among the five donor materials (Fig. 2b), the difference of exciton dissociation and charge collection behaviors should be responsible for the large variation in the Jsc and FF of the SM-OSCs based on 1–5:PC71BM. To better understand these characteristics, we analyzed the dependence of the photocurrent density (Jph) on the effective voltage (Veff), as presented in Fig. 4c. Here, Jph is defined as JL − JD, where JL and JD are the current densities of the devices under illumination and in the dark, respectively; Veff that governs the internal electric field within the device, is defined as Veff = V0 − V, where V0 is the voltage at which Jph is fully compensated (i.e., Jph = 0) and V is the external applied voltage.32 Upon increasing Veff up to ∼1.5 V, the Jph increased and reached saturation (to give Jsat), indicating that almost all photo-generated excitons were dissociated into free charge carriers and collected by the electrodes with minimal bimolecular recombination. The ratio of Jph to Jsat (Jph/Jsat) is a useful measure of the overall efficiency (or probability) for exciton dissociation and charge collection in OSCs. Under short-circuit conditions, Jph/Jsat ratios as large as 0.96–0.97 were obtained for the end-halogenated 2–5-based devices, while it was 0.88 for the 1-based device. Even at the maximum power output conditions, the 2–5-based devices likewise exhibited much larger Jph/Jsat ratios of 0.77–0.81 as compared to the 1-based device (0.58). These results unambiguously indicate that the end-halogenation of the SM donors leads to more efficient exciton dissociation and charge transport and collection, contributing to enhanced FF of the devices.
As shown in Fig. 4d and e, we also measured the Jsc and Voc for each optimized device under different incident light intensities (P) in the range of 1–100 mW cm−2 (i.e., 0.01–1 sun) to further analyze the charge recombination behavior. In general, the relationship between Jsc and P can be described as Jsc ∝ Pα,19,33 where the exponential factor α is a figure-of-merit denoting the degree of bimolecular charge recombination. If more dissociated free charge carriers can be swept out and collected by the electrodes prior to recombination, α is closer to 1 (α ≤ 1). By fitting the double logarithmic plots of Jscversus P (Fig. 4d), similar α values of 0.94–0.96 were obtained for the SM-OSCs made with 1–5:PC71BM, confirming that none of these devices suffered from serious bimolecular recombination losses under short-circuit conditions. The dependence of Voc on P can be used to probe the charge recombination behavior under open-circuit conditions, in which all photo-generated charge carriers should recombine within the device (Fig. 4e). In principle, bimolecular (Langevin) recombination is the sole dominant mechanism when the slope of Vocversus ln(P) is equal to 1kT/q (= 25.86 mV at 300 K); whereas trap-assisted (Shockley–Read–Hall) recombination should be much more pronounced when the slope approaches 2kT/q (where k is the Boltzmann constant, T is absolute temperature, and q is the elementary charge).33,34 While the slopes of the fitted lines for the 2–5-based devices were in the range of 1.33–1.43kT/q, the 1-based device exhibited the smallest slope close to 1kT/q. It is thus anticipated that the 1:PC71BM blend can reduce the trap densities at the D/A interfaces, thereby suppressing the monomolecular or trap-assisted recombination.
The charge transport properties are another important factor in determining the photovoltaic device performance, especially FF. As demonstrated in Fig. 5, the hole mobilities of 1–5 in both neat films and blend films were measured using the hole-only devices by fitting their J–V data to a space-charge-limited current (SCLC) model.35 As listed in Table 2, all as-spun neat films exhibited rather high hole mobilities (μD) that exceeded 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1. Notably, the μD of pristine 1 reached ∼0.1 cm2 V−1 s−1, which was approximately twice as high as those of end-halogenated 2–5 in the neat films, owing to its higher degree of molecular ordering (see below). However, as a consequence of excessive material mixing with the PC71BM acceptor, the hole mobility of the 1:PC71BM blend film (μD/A) was decreased sharply by more than one order of magnitude, lowering to 3.5× 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1. In contrast, the μD/A values of the 2–5:PC71BM blend films were found to be unchanged even after mixing with PC71BM, retaining the high values in the order of 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1. This feature is attributable to suppressed material mixing between the end-halogenated SM donors and PC71BM acceptor at the molecular level.

Film morphology and nanostructures
The nanoscale structural order and crystallinity of 1–5 in the neat films and BHJ blend films were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements, as presented in Fig. 6. Nonhalogenated 1 exhibited a relatively sharper (100) diffraction peak located at 0.33 Å−1 (d = 1.9 nm) together with higher-order diffractions of up to (300), originating from the ordered lamellar packing in the thin films. For both neat and blend films of 2–5, somewhat broader (100) diffraction peaks were observed at 0.32–0.34 Å−1, corresponding to similar interlamellar distances of d = 1.8–2.0 nm. Using the Scherrer equation,36 the crystal coherence lengths (or crystallite sizes) for 1–5 were estimated by correlating with the full-width at half-maximum of the respective (100) peak in the XRD patterns. The lamellar coherence length (L) for 1 in the blend film was estimated to be 18 nm (corresponding to ∼10 molecular lamellar stacks), much smaller than that in the neat film (L = 30 nm), which was likely responsible for the lower hole mobility (Table 2). In contrast, the calculated lamellar coherence lengths for end-halogenated 2–5 in their neat and blend films were all 12–14 nm, and remained almost unchanged even after mixing with PC71BM.
 Fig. 6  XRD patterns of (a) neat films of 1–5 and (b) blend films of 1–5:PC71BM (2:1, w/w). 
The interior morphologies of the BHJ active layers were also characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As can be seen from Fig. 7, the TEM images of the 1–5:PC71BM blend films revealed markedly different nanoscale phase segregation for the five analogous SM donors, depending only on the variation in the terminal substituents. The bright and dark regions in each TEM image correspond to the SM donor-rich and PC71BM-rich domains, respectively, as PC71BM has a higher electron density than the SM donors. The nonhalogenated 1:PC71BM blend film had relatively homogeneous and fine nanostructures with closely mixed D/A networks (Fig. 7a). Because the Jsc of the BHJ OSCs is closely related with the interfacial domain area, it is envisioned that this smaller size scaled D/A segregation in 1:PC71BM is beneficial for photocurrent generation. Upon fluorination, however, the length scale of the D/A phase segregation evidently increased and distinct agglomerates (over 100 nm in size) existed within the 2:PC71BM blend film (Fig. 7b), presumably because of the low entropy of mixing. More importantly, when the terminal halogen groups were replaced by larger Cl, Br, and I atoms, the domain sizes became gradually smaller (Fig. 7c–e), and much finer bicontinuous D/A interpenetrating networks were eventually formed with the 5:PC71BM blend film.

For more quantitative comparison of these nanoscale BHJ morphologies, mean domain sizes (D), which correspond to the periodicity of the phase-segregated structures, were estimated using power spectral densities (PSDs) obtained from two-dimensional fast Fourier transform (2D-FFT) analysis37 (Fig. 7f). From the PSD peak positions, the average domain sizes in the BHJ blend films were found to decrease in the order fluorinated 2 (D = 56 nm) ≈ chlorinated 3 (D = 55 nm) > brominated 4 (D = 44 nm) > iodinated 5 (D = 32 nm) > nonhalogenated 1 (D = 11 nm). Considering the limited exciton diffusion length of organic semiconductors, which is usually less than 10 nm, finely nano-segregated domains without excessive agglomeration would be more favorable for charge generation at the D/A interfaces, though each domain needs to have proper size and purity for ensuring the effective percolation channels of charge transport. It seemed that the interior morphologies obtained for the iodinated 5:PC71BM blend best matched these criteria, and hence, resulted in superior performance in the SM-OSCs.
Interfacial free energy analysis
The surface free energy of a material is defined as the excess of energy at its surface as compared to the bulk, and is influenced by its polarity, crystallinity, and noncovalent intermolecular interactions. To quantify the miscibility (compatibility) between the donor and acceptor materials and unveil the mechanism of the interior morphological changes in the 1–5:PC71BM BHJ systems, we evaluated the surface free energies of 1–5 as well as PC71BM from the contact angle measurements (ESI†). The correlation between the contact angle (θ) and surface free energies of a solid surface (γS) and a probe liquid (γL) is given by the Young equation: γS = γSL + γLcosθ(1)where γSL denotes the interfacial free energy between the solid (S) and liquid (L) interface. Here, the total solid surface free energy γS is defined as the sum of the surface dispersive and polar components (γdS and γpS, respectively) as follows. γS = γdS + γpS(2)
According to the Owens–Wendt–Kaelble method,38γSL is represented using the following geometric mean function: (3)where γdL and γpL are the dispersive and polar components of the liquid surface free energy (γL = γdL + γpL). By combining eqn (1) and (3), the following formula can be derived. (4)Accordingly, if the θ, γdL, and γpL values for different probe liquids are given, γdS and γpS of each material can be calculated by using eqn (4).

Fig. 8a depicts the Owens–Wendt plots for the as-spun neat films of 1–5 and PC71BM wetted by different probe liquids (i.e., water, glycerol, ethylene glycol, N,N-dimethylformamide, and octane) based on the contact angle measurements. From linear regression for these plots using eqn (4), the γd and γp values of each material could be extracted, and are listed in Table 3. The PC71BM film had a relatively large total surface free energy (γ) of 35.4 mJ m−2, which is close to the literature values.39 Among the four end-halogenated SM donors, iodinated 5 and brominated 4 exhibited the largest γ values (28.8 mJ m−2), which primarily originated from the increase of the dispersive component via iodination and bromination. It is anticipated that the closer γ values of the individual components in the BHJ binary blends improved the miscibility of the materials, resulting in well-mixed D/A domains. To obtain more direct information about the morphological differences, the D/A interfacial free energies (γD/A) between these SM donors and PC71BM acceptor were assessed using the following equation (cf.eqn (3)): (5)where subscripts D and A denote 1–5 and PC71BM, respectively. As presented in Fig. 8b and Table 3, the subtle difference in the terminal halogen atoms resulted in significant changes of the γD/A values, which were consistently reduced from 2 through 5. Therefore, for the iodinated 5:PC71BM system with the smallest γD/A value, the energy penalty required to form a large D/A interfacial area (or fine D/A interpenetrating networks with a small mean domain size) can be minimized, as observed in the TEM images (Fig. 7e). In contrast, the fluorinated 2:PC71BM and chlorinated 3:PC71BM systems with larger γD/A values tended to form less homogeneous, aggregated morphologies originating from the suppressed D/A interface formation during the spin-coating process (Fig. 7b and c). Correspondingly, the resultant Jsc values of the OSC devices were found to have a close correlation with the γD/A. It is noteworthy that as for the end-halogenated 2–5:PC71BM BHJ systems, a smaller γD/A and mean domain size led to a higher Jsc in the actual OSC devices (Fig. 8b).

Conclusions
In this paper, we presented a new family of photovoltaic SM donors, BDT-ID-Xs (X = H, F, Cl, Br, and I), having the same π-conjugated backbone but different terminal halogen groups. Employing this series of analogous materials, we systematically investigated the impact of end-halogenation on the physicochemical, charge-transport, and photovoltaic properties as well as film morphological characteristics. All these molecules demonstrated a very similar strong photoabsorption over a wide visible range, with comparable large extinction coefficients (>105 cm−1) and narrow bandgaps (∼1.7 eV) in the solid state. Importantly, it was found that the subtle change in the terminal halogen groups drastically influenced the photovoltaic properties and film morphologies. Among these end-halogenated SM donors, the iodinated and brominated materials indeed achieved remarkable photovoltaic performance with PCEs of up to 9.2% and 8.2%, respectively, by significant increment of Jsc and FF in the fullerene-based SM-OSCs, without using any solvent additives. Further, the morphological analyses revealed that end-halogenation with heavy halogen atoms, typified by I and Br, allowed effective modulation of the interfacial free energy of the blend with PC71BM and facilitated the spontaneous formation of finer D/A interpenetrating networks within the active layer. Although attention has never been paid to such I- and Br-containing functional materials so far (except for the synthetic precursors and monomers for the cross-coupling reactions), our results clearly demonstrate that the strategic halogenation with I and Br groups is an effective and versatile approach for producing sophisticated organic semiconducting materials. We thus anticipate that these useful iodinated and brominated building blocks will be widely applied in future studies of OSCs, organic energy-harvesting devices,40 and other organic electronic devices.

Although the electronegativity of F (χ = 3.98) is much greater than Cl (χ = 3.16), the calculated dipole moment of chloro-ID unit (μ = 2.55 D) is larger than fluoro-ID unit (μ = 2.08 D). This is attributable to the larger dipole moment of the C–Cl bond than the C–F bond.
