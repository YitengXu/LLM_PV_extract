1. Introduction
The rapid advances of electrochemical energy storage (EES) techniques originate from the contradiction between the intermittent/fluctuating supply of natural energy and the continually growing demand for mobile power consumption.1 The demand for high energy-density systems triggers the boom of portable EES devices, including secondary batteries (e.g. Li-ion, Na-ion, Li–S, Na–S, etc.) and supercapacitors. For this reason, a large amount of available and sustainable electrode materials have been developed.2–5 Among all fascinating battery systems, lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are the most promising devices due to their superior energy/rate ability, ultra-long cycling stability, zero memory effect, and low price.6,7 In recent years, with deep research on LIBs and SIBs, various electrode materials have been found and included in the energy storage field, such as 2D materials and metal oxide composites.8–12 As family members of candidates for energy-storage materials, coordination polymers (CPs, one-dimensional) and metal–organic frameworks (MOFs two-/three-dimensional) have been confirmed as potential electrode materials owing to their several advantages: (1) the rich variety of choices (>20000 species); (2) the adjustable pore spaces; (3) robust and tunable framework structures; (4) well-organized open channels; (5) high chemical/thermal stability; and (6) multi-electron reactions (Fig. 1).1,13–22

Several terminology guidelines in this review need to be distinguished for a clear understanding of the topics. The term metal organic polymers (MOPs) is used to describe the materials with metal node centers bridged with more than one ligand, and this binding (or coordination interaction) is extended to an infinite array with one-/two-/three-dimensional structures.23–26 MOPs consist of CPs, MOFs, Prussian blue (PB), and Prussian blue analogues (PBAs). Although PB was firstly found in the 18th century with the general formula Fe4[Fe(CN)6]3·xH2O, its application in rechargeable batteries is less developed compared to CPs and MOFs.
In recent years, enormous efforts have been devoted to the molecular design, structural layout,27,28 and experimental synthesis29,30 of MOPs, and their advanced applications. Elaborate selection of various functional groups for organic ligands, different valences or species for metal clusters, and smart pores or building cells can yield versatile ways for the utilization of MOP materials. They can be used not only in traditional gas capture31–33 and metal ion separation34–37 but also in biological-mass delivery,38 chemical sensors,39–42 optical/electric catalysts43–49 and EES-related cells.50–55 Due to the diversity of porous frameworks and multiformity of chemical elements, pristine MOPs can be used, beyond the field of batteries, from separators/membranes,56–59 solid/liquid electrolytes,60–62 hosts for redox-active materials (Si,63 sulfur,64–67 metal oxides,68 metal particles69) to electrochemically active electrode materials. Building on our previous studies on metal chalcogenide crystals as active materials in Li-ion batteries,70,71 the successful experience to overcome the issues of bulk pulverization and volume expansion would help us to design MOPs with high specific capacity and long-term cycling performance. In fact, we are actively working on these materials and several primary results have been achieved.
This review will comprehensively focus on the exploration of MOPs, particularly CPs, MOFs, PB and their analogous (PBAs), as redox-active electrode materials in rechargeable lithium-ion batteries and sodium-ion batteries. Although a large number of inorganic porous materials with well-designed structures, such as nanostructured metal-based compounds (MxSy, MxOy, MxOy/C, and MxOy/M)72–76 and carbon nanomaterials (N-doped carbon, hollow or core–shell carbon)77–82 derived from crystal MOP precursors, have been widely discussed in recent reviews, our discussion will only cover pristine MOPs as lithium/sodium ion storage materials. Strictly speaking, instead of pure crystals, MOF-derived compounds are similar to common nanomaterials without preserved topotactic crystallinity and distinctive nanoporous channels. From this perspective, here we begin with the discussion of general electrochemical mechanisms of MOP electrodes, including the comparison of conversion-type, insertion-type, and a novel intercalation scheme – “bipolar charging”. The contributing factors that dominate the ion storage capacity, rate capability, and cycling stability are introduced with respect to whether metal clusters or organic moieties are involved in the redox-reactions or not. Then, to further improve the battery performance, we propose six strategies classified from recent progress in pristine MOP electrode materials including: (1) the substitution and optimization of metal nodes; (2) the tuning and functionalization of bridging ligands; (3) the control and enhancement of electronic conductivity; (4) realization of high operating voltage-cathode applications; (5) PBA-based electrode materials; and (6) other approaches (the tunability of particle size and pore type, multifarious morphologies and so on). Finally, apart from LIBs/SIBs, we extend the application of pristine MOPs to other cation-based batteries, such as potassium ion batteries, zinc ion batteries, and magnesium ion batteries. By summarizing and identifying recent evolutions in intact MOPs for EES-related applications, we expect to provide some aid for further investigation on pristine MOPs as battery electrodes.
2 Redox-reaction chemistries of pristine metal organic polymers
Li-ion batteries (LIBs) are commonly referred to as “rocking-chair” batteries, because they can provide chemical energy via a reversible “rocking” of Li+ back and forth between the positive and negative electrodes during the charge/discharge process.83 Specifically, the storage and supply of chemical energy from an electrode is achieved by the reversible acceptance and the release of Li+ between the electrode and electrolyte, which can be mediated through Li+ intercalation or the breaking/reforming of chemical bonds with an accompanying movement of electrons.17 Similarly, it has been proposed that MOP-based electrodes could store and deliver electrochemical energy through two specific mechanisms: conversion type (usually following an alloying/de-alloying process) and insertion-type.
2.1 Conversion-type reaction
When MOPs undergo conversion-type reactions, the central metal ions are usually reduced into the metallic state or lithium-containing alloys. Due to the huge transition of the chemical composition during charge/discharge, the entire MOP framework structure inevitably collapses.84 Chen et al. firstly used the conversion principle to explain the lithium storage mechanism of a MOF-177 (or Zn4O(BTB)2) anode, with a theoretical capacity of 190 mA h g−1.85 During the first step of the lithiation process, MOF-177 is reduced into metallic Zn and Li2O, which is accompanied by the destruction of the integrated framework (Fig. 2a and b). Then, guest molecules such as N,N-diethylformamide (DEF) and H2O react with Li+ to form Li2(DEF) and LiOH. The final step is a reversible alloying/de-alloying reaction, as shown in eqn (1); Zn + Li+ + e− ↔ LiZn(1)

The proposed mechanism delivers a specific capacity of ∼100 mA h g−1 after the first cycle. In contrast to the poor cyclability of MOF-177, Zn3(HCOO)6 with a simple ligand shows stable cycling performance over many cycles via a reversible conversion reaction.86 An invariable specific capacity of 560 mA h g−1 is obtained after 60 cycles at 60 mA g−1 between 0.005 V and 3.0 V (vs. Li/Li+). Upon Li+ incorporation into Zn3(HCOO)6 during the discharging process, the metal-formate scaffold is reversibly converted into lithium formate and metallic Zn, instead of formation of the irreversible side-product Li2O. The subsequent Zn/LiZn alloying reaction further maintains a stable lithium storage. Besides MOFs, some metal-based coordination polymers (CPs) also present a similar conversion scheme. Zn-ODCP, with the formula Zn(H2mpca)2(tfbdc)(H2O) (H2mpca = 3-methylpyrazole-4-carboxylic acid; H2tfbdc = tetrafluorobenzene-1,4-dicarboxylic acid), was firstly applied as an anode to accommodate Li (up to 26 mol of Li).87 This Zn-based CP still expresses reversible conversion and alloying/dealloying reactions: [Zn(II)(H2mpca)2(tfbdc)(H2O)] + 3Li+ + 3e− → [Zn(II)Li2(mpca)2(tfbdc)] + LiOH(2) [Zn(II)Li2(mpca)2(tfbdc)] + nLi+ + ne− ↔ [Zn(0)Lin+2(mpca)2(tfbdc)](3) Zn + Li+ + e− ↔ LiZn(4)
During the first cycle, the coordinated H2O and decomposed electrolyte produce the irreversible formation of LiOH, which causes the electrode to present an initial coulombic efficiency as low as 39.5%. However, a specific capacity of 342 mA h g−1 is delivered at the second cycle, and 300 mA h g−1 remains at the 50th cycle. The good cycling performance of this Zn-based CP comes from (1) multi-redox active sites including Zn(II) and conjugated carboxylates from mpca and tfbdc ligands; (2) flexible 1D chains, which provide shorter Li ion diffusion space; and (3) the reversible transformation and regeneration of the CP structure. Additionally, similar battery reaction principles have been used to explain the case of Co3(HCOO)6,86 Mn-LCP (Mn(tfbdc)(4,4′-bpy)(H2O)2),88 Cu-BDC [Cu2(C8H4O4)4]n,89 Ni-Me4bpz ([H2Me4bpz = 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethyl-4,4′-bipyrazole]),90 Zn-LMOF (Zn(4,4′-bpy)(tfbdc)(H2O)2),91 Co-LCP (Co(tfbdc)(4,40-bpy)(H2O)2),92 and CoCOP (polycarboxylate-Co coordination polymer).93
2.2 Insertion-type reaction
Even though several modifications have been suggested to overcome the limited cycle life of conversion-type MOPs, their limited cyclability still cannot satisfy the existing energy storage devices because of the obvious degradation of structures and compositions. As such, insertion-type MOPs have gained more attention as their structures tend to be maintained after Li+ insertion/extraction reactions, which can provide stable and quick ion diffusion channels.15 During the lithiation/delithiation process, metal cations such as Li+/Na+ are transferred between the electrolyte and the pores or the framework of MOP electrodes. In addition, pristine MOPs possess multi-redox active sites at the inorganic metal hubs and organic bridging ligands, leading to a high theoretical specific capacity and rate capability. However, different coordination surroundings, including the valency or kind of metal node and diverse groups of organic linkers, may influence the active-redox reaction sites.97 Depending on the functional components that provide redox active sites, MOPs can be classified into three different classes: redox active inorganic metal node-dominant, redox active organic bridging ligand-dominant, and both redox active inorganic/organic moieties.

2.2.1 Insertion type: redox active inorganic metal node-dominant. 
Li storage can be achieved by the redox couples of metal nodes, such as Fe3+/Fe2+, Ni3+/Ni2+, V5+/V4+, V4+/V3+ and so on. Once lithium ions are inserted into the frameworks, metal ions will be reduced into lower oxidation states to balance the charge in the whole electrode. However, the number of electrons that the metal-ion redox couples can offer is much smaller than that of organic ligands. Thus, a limited theoretical gravimetric energy density is inevitable for redox active metal node-dominant MOPs. Since Tarascon et al. proposed the lithium storage possibility of MIL-53(Fe) FeIII(OH)0.8F0.2(O2CC6H4CO2), redox active Fe-based MOFs via the Fe3+/Fe2+ couple have gradually attracted considerable interest. Examples including MIL-101(Fe) and MIL-100(Fe) have been thoroughly investigated.98–104 MIL-53(Fe) exhibits a gravimetric capacity of 75 mA h g−1 and a volumetric capacity of 140 mA h L−1 when cycled at 0.025C in the voltage range of 1.5–3.5 V (vs. Li/Li+). During the charge/discharge process, 0.6 Li+ ions are taken up/removed per unit formula, accompanied by the Fe3+/Fe2+ redox couple. Similar Fe3+/Fe2+ mixed valence states also occur during lithiation/delithiation in the MIL-101(Fe) electrode, delivering 0.2 Li+ per Fe after 30 cycles at 0.1C between 2.0 and 3.5 V. But the oxidation of Fe2+ to Fe3+ is irreversible after many cycles, due to the fact that higher energy is required for further insertion of Li+ in the MIL-101(Fe) framework. Additionally, the lithium ion storage mechanism of MIL-47(V) [VIV(O)(bdc)],105 KLi[(VO)2(HPO4)2(C2O4)],106 Li2(VO)2(HPO4)2(C2O4),107 or Ni (TA) (TA = trimesic acid)108 can also be explained by the same redox active metal node-dominant scheme.


2.2.2 Insertion type: redox-active organic bridging ligand-dominant. 
The versatility and tunability of redox active functional groups at organic linkers make them desirable to realize multi-electron reactions. Like many organic electrode materials, such as conjugated carbonyl compounds and conducting polymers, the electrochemically active sites of bridging linkers are mainly located at oxygen atom-based groups (–COO− and –CO), nitrogen atom-based groups (imidazole, pyridine, and amine groups), and aromatic rings containing delocalized π electron clouds.
The synergistic lithium storage effect between carboxyl and benzene rings has shown great success in MOPs, as shown in Fig. 2e and f, on the basis of the linkers of 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylate (BTC),109–112 1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid (BDC),95,113–115 1,2,4,5-benzenetetracarboxylic acid,116 2,5-dihydroxyterephthalic acid,117 1,4-naphthalene dicarboxylate (NDC),118,119 and so on. The presence of conjugated carboxylates, which show weak withdrawing electron effects and have strong π–π interactions with the aromatic core, can lead to a stable framework of MOPs.111,112 Moreover, high theoretical capacity and rate capability can be obtained through the redox coordination of COO− and Li+ as well as the accommodation of Li+ at each benzene ring (maximum up to 6 Li+ per aromatic ring) with enhanced ionic conductivity.120 Mahanty et al. prepared Mn-BTC MOFs (Mn-1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylate) as anodes for LIBs, which delivered a high specific capacity of 694 mA h g−1 at a current density of 103 mA g−1 between 0.01 and 2.0 V (vs. Li/Li+) with an 83% capacity retention at the 100th cycle.112 Even when tested at a higher current density of about 1.0 A g−1, the Mn-1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylate-based electrode displays a stable capacity of around 400 mA h g−1 after a few initial cycles and demonstrates an ∼100% capacity retention after 100 cycles. The same ligands were used to synthesize Cu-BTC MOF, [Cu3(1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylate)2], anodes for LIBs.111 A specific capacity of ∼474 mA h g−1 is obtained at a high current density of ∼383 mA g−1, and a nearly 100% capacity retention is maintained after 50 cycles. Hu et al. applied Co-BDC MOFs as anode materials for storing lithium ions.114 When they are evaluated in the potential window of 0.01–3.0 V (vs. Li/Li+) at 200 mA g−1, a discharge capacity of 1090.2 mA h g−1 is obtained after 100 cycles, which is equal to 70.7% of the capacity during the first cycle. Moreover, when increasing the current density to 500 mA g−1 and 1 A g−1, Co-BDC can still retain a discharge capacity of 795 mA h g−1 and 611 mA h g−1 until 200 cycles, respectively. Furthermore, the capacity only fades 3.2% after 200 cycles at 500 mA g−1.
The strong interaction effect between Li+/Na+ and electron-donating N atoms in heterocyclic ligands makes N-rich functional groups desirable for lithium/sodium intercalation. 3D coordination polymers, built with 5-hydroxynicotinic acid (H2NA), forming [M(NA)]n (M = Co(II) or Ni(II)), show a high specific capacity of 618 and 610 mA h g−1 at a current density of 100 mA g−1 in the potential range of 0.01–3 V (vs. Li/Li+) at the 100th cycle, respectively.94Fig. 2c and d show an example of [Ni(NA)n]n, with a maintained morphology after the charge–discharge treatment. As for the [Co(NA)]n anode, an excellent rate capability is evidenced by the capacity returning to 742 mA h g−1 at 50 mA g−1 after a successive rate test at 50 mA g−1 (723 mA h g−1), 100 mA g−1 (636 mA h g−1), 200 mA g−1 (543 mA h g−1), 500 mA g−1 (421 mA h g−1), and 1000 mA g−1 (345 mA h g−1). XPS analysis demonstrates that with the redox inactive Co/Ni ions, NA2− anions participate in Li attachment at the carboxyl group, hydroxy group, nitrogen atom, and pyridine ring. In another case, Hu et al. fabricated Co-BDCN CPs through a one-pot synthesis, and the lithium ions are stored at the O and N atoms of amide and the benzene ring.121 A specific capacity of 1132 mA h g−1 was achieved after the 100th cycle at 100 mA g−1 between 0.01 V and 3.0 V (Vs. Li/Li+). Besides, imidazole-based MOFs can also undergo a lithium-ion binding process at the N atoms in organic ligands.122 Zeolitic ZIF-8 and ZIF-67 have a stable capacity of 335.3 and 311.6 mA h g−1 at 0.2C in the voltage range of 0.01–3.0 V (vs. Li/Li+) after 70 cycles, respectively.123 In addition, more organic ligands with electrochemically active N atoms, including abIM (2-aminobenzimidazole)122 and HAB (hexaaminobenzene),97 have been investigated and showed great potential as electrodes.


2.2.3 Insertion type: both redox-active inorganic/organic moieties. 
Without the direct engagement of metal centers during the charge/discharge process, organic moieties (i.e. –COO−, –NH2, and the benzene ring) can effectively complete the lithium insertion/de-insertion and provide multi-redox-electrons. Moreover, the intact metal centers that do not mediate electron transfer can play the role of stabilizing the whole framework. However, metal nodes will make gravimetric energy density lower because of their redox inactivity and high molecular weight. The review below aims to balance these counteracting points and gives good examples for further research.
u-CoOHtp, consisting of a Co-terephthalate MOF, was found to have good Na-ion storage behavior ascribed to the introduction of oxygen vacancies at the unsaturated metal nodes. Oxygen vacancies were introduced via an expedient ultrasonic method and could enhance the ion- and charge-migration rates.124Ex situ XAFS and sXAS analyses reveal that, during the discharge process, Co2+ is reduced to Co0 and carboxyl oxygen atoms are coordinated with Na+. A mixed-phase of Co-MOF, CoOx, and Co0 is produced during the charge process, however, their reversibility during the subsequent redox reaction process brings forth a stable and long cycling life. The discharge capacity of u-CoOHtp is 774 mA h g−1 at the 1st cycle and 371 mA h g−1 at the 50th cycle under the test conditions of 0.01–3.00 V (vs. Na/Na+) and 50 mA g−1. When u-CoTDA (H2TDA = 2,5-thiophenedicarboxylic) is applied as an anode material for LIBs (0.01–3.00 V vs. Li/Li+), a high capacity of 790 mA h g−1 could be maintained after 300 cycles at a current density of 1 A g−1, and 548 mA h g−1 after 400 cycles at 2 A g−1.125Ex situ CoK-edge XANES, OK-edge sXAS, and EPR observations conclude the reversible occurrence of the Co(II)/Co(0) reaction and Li+ insertion/extraction on oxygen atoms at bridging ligands. Shen et al. reported Fe-BTC with a Basolite F300-like structure, which delivered 1021 mA h g−1 (100th, 100 mA g−1), 436 mA h g−1 (400th, 500 mA g−1) and 408 mA h g−1 (400th, 1000 mA g−1), accompanied by Fe3+/Fe2+ transformation and Li+ reversible accommodation/extraction on organic moieties.126 Dong et al. activated the –COO− of MIL-53(Fe) bridging linkers by modifying it with a high-conductivity RGO.127 Besides, Cu-TCA (H3TCA = tricarboxytriphenyl amine) presents redox properties both at the metal nodes of Cu(II)/Cu(I) and organic moieties of N+/N.128 Also, the coexistence of redox active metal centers and bridging ligands has been found in the samples of Cu(2,7-AQDC),129 Ni-NTC,130 and MIL-136(Ni, Co).131

2.3 Novel insertion/extraction principle – “bipolar charging” scheme
The ordered open channels and controllable pore space endow MOP materials with unique “bipolar charging behavior” during the charge/discharge process. For this reason, both cations (such as Li+ and Na+) and anions (such as PF6− and BF4−) can be captured into the frameworks and contribute to the total capacity.15 In a common case, anions (PF6−) are taken up into the frameworks during the charge process, and cations (Li+) are impregnated during the discharge process, which is helpful to realize a less crowded ion transportation and fast-ion diffusion process in solid state MOPs. Moreover, in the case of Mn7(2,7-AQDC)6(2,6-AQDC)(DMA)6, even though the ionic radius of PF6− is much larger than that of Li+, these two ions exhibit comparable ion diffusion speeds. The novel and unique electrochemical mechanism of MOP electrodes may offer a possible way to develop large migration ions, such as Zn2+, Mg2+, Al3+ and anions in new battery systems beyond Li+.18
Nishihara et al. proposed a 2D conductive NiDI (bis(diimino)nickel) coordination framework, which was observed to provide energy storage by the uptake of both PF6− and Li+ (Fig. 3a).132 The specific cation and anion movement and charge transition states are explained by: (1) the transformation between the original neutral state (O) and positively oxidized state (O+) accompanied by the insertion/extraction of PF6−, corresponding to the anodic peak of 3.73 V and cathodic peak of 3.56 V in CV curves; (2) the transformation between the original neutral state (O) and negatively reduced state (O−) accompanied by the insertion/desertion of Li+, corresponding to the anodic/cathodic peak of ∼3.21 V. It is proposed that once redox active ions are inserted into the pores of NiDI, the charge of N atoms and Ni atoms in the framework will be re-arranged to stabilize the electronic structure. The NiDI electrode shows a specific capacity of 155 mA h g−1 at 10 mA g−1, and a stable capacity until the 300th cycle at a current density of 250 mA g−1. Awaga et al. discovered that the Mn-MOF, with the formula Mn7(2,7-AQDC)6(2,6-AQDC)(DMA)6 (AQDC = anthraquinone dicarboxylics, DMA = N,N-dimethylacetamide), offers the capacity based on its positive and negative forms, named the “bipolar charging” scheme.133 As shown in Fig. 3b, during the charge step, Mn2+ is oxidized to Mn3+ and bulk PF6− anions (X−) are inserted into the framework; while during the discharge process, the extraction of PF6− ions first happens, followed by the incorporation of Li+ and the reduction of ligands – anthraquinone groups (L−). A capacity of 205 mA h g−1 was obtained at an operating current of 1 mA within 1.3–4.5 V, corresponding to the transformation of 2 electrons per AQDC ligand and 1 electron per Mn ion.

The diverse organic ligands and multi-valent metal ions offer endless possibilities of chemical compositions and framework structures for MOP materials, which bring forth many suitable choices favorable for enhancing battery performance.25 There are many present forms of metal nodes in redox-MOPs, including mono-valent alkali metal ions, multi-valent transition metal ions, mixed-valent metal ions, different kinds of metal ions, and so on.15,16,84,91,111,118,134–141 Thus, it's necessary to discuss the possible choice of metal nodes in order to lay a foundation for future research. Considering that other sections mainly focus on the analysis of multi-valent metal nodes, the following paragraph will switch to those redox-MOPs characterized by (1) mono-valent metal ions and (2) mixed-kind metal ions.
Different from the research of multi-valent transition metal ions, less attention is paid to +1 valence state alkali ions (Li+, Na+, K+, Rb+, and Cs+) in coordination polymers. The [Li2(C6H2O4)] coordination polymer, bridged by Li–O bonds between 2,5-dihydroxy-1,4-benzoquinone ligands and lithium metal nodes, is prepared as a candidate for cathodes in LIBs as its CO groups are good for reversible Li ion insertion/deinsertion at redox-active oxygen atoms.142 When the test conditions are set at 100 mA g−1 within 1.5–3.5 V (vs. Li/Li+), it presents an initial capacity of ∼176 mA h g−1 and up to 137 mA h g−1 after 10 cycles, which is much higher than that of 90 mA h g−1 delivered by the cathode based on the ligand itself. Later, Devic et al. reported a series of 3D M2(TTF-TC)H2 coordination polymers derived from (TTF-TC)H4 (=tetracarboxylic acid) and alkaline ions (K+, Rb+, and Cs+), denoted as MIL-132(K), MIL-133(K or Rb), and MIL-134(Cs).143 All of them show good thermal stability when exposed to a 150–200 °C air atmosphere. Interestingly, K(TTF-TC+˙)H2, based on the oxidized TTF-TC+˙ which is a S-rich π-electron donor, exhibits an electronic conductivity of ∼1 mS cm−1 at room temperature and a charge capacity of about 50–60 mA h g−1 between 2 V and 4 V (vs. Li/Li+) at 10 mV s−1 of solid-state CV. Chen et al. synthesized and studied a great deal of 3D alkali-cation coordination polymers bridged with H2OBA (=4,4′-oxybisbenzoic acid), including [Li2(OBA)], [Na2(OBA)(H2O)], [K(HOBA)], [Rb(HOBA)], and [Cs(HOBA)], with the merits of high thermal stability.144 For the Li2(OBA) CP anode (0.1–3 V, 1Li+ per 10 h vs. Li0), the 1st discharge capacity is 106 mA h g−1 and the 30th discharge capacity remains at ∼100 mA h g−1, showing a good cyclability. In summary, even though the research of alkali cations is not such a hot topic as that of transition metal ions, they still provide more selectable candidates for constructing redox-coordination polymers.138,145–147
Polyoxometalates (POMs) are a class of metal-oxide-cluster anions, with the general units of MOx (M = V, Mo, and W), which can perform multi-electron redox reactions and maintain structural stability during the electrochemical process. However, their high solubility in organic solvents limits their application in organic electrolyte battery systems because of the inevitable dissolution of active materials and capacity fading. To decrease their solubility, POM-based MOFs, namely POMOFs, have been constructed through chelating metal centers and hetero-atoms in POM as well as other conventional ligands. As a result, POMOFs combine the advantages of multi-electron transfer of POMs and high structural stability of MOFs. Polymolybdates have been favourably chosen to synthesize POMOFs and demonstrated a promising electrochemical performance as reported by La and coauthors.148–151 To prepare [PMoV8MoVI4O37(OH)3Zn4] [TPT]5·2TPT·2H2O (where TPT = tris-(4-pyridyl)triazine), namely NNU-11, the layers of Zn-ε-Keggin units linked by TPT ligands stack together to form a π–π stacking 3D array, where each Zn(II) ion coordinates with three bridging oxygen atoms from the ε-Keggin fragment, while at the same time, four embedded Zn(II) ions chelate with two nitrogen atoms of two TPT ligands (Fig. 4a and b).149 A stable capacity of 750 mA h g−1 at 50 mA g−1 within 0.01–3.0 V (vs. Li/Li+) is obtained over 200 cycles, which comes from (1) the reversible Zn2+/Zn and Mo6+/Mo4+ redox couples and (2) the lithium insertion/extraction movement at the uncoordinated N of pyridine. Interestingly, the existing π–π stacking factor provides the benefits of (1) improving the electronic conductivity and decreasing the ohmic loss, and (2) providing more Li+ storage sites by pseudo-capacitance behavior. Two thermally stable POMOFs, NENU-506 (TBA)3[PMoV8MoVI4O38(OH)2Zn4(IN)2] and NENU-507 (TBA)3[PMoV8MoVI4O38(OH)2Zn4(PBA)2]·H2O, (where IN = isonicotinic acid, TBA+ = tetrabutylammonium ion, and HPBA = 4-(pyridin-4-yl)benzoic acid), are synthesized and employed in LIB anodes (0.01–3.0 V, vs. Li/Li+).151 A better cycling performance is shown at the NENU-507 electrode, which presents 640 mA h g−1 over 100 cycles and ∼96.68% capacity of the 2nd cycle. Material characterization reveals that the redox active transition metal ions (Mo and Zn) and Li+ coordination interaction with organic ligands contribute to the whole battery performance. Besides the above-mentioned polymolybdate-POMOFs, polyoxometalate units as building units for POMOF-based electrode materials can also be seen in [H3SiMo12O40], [H5SiMo12O40], [H5GeMo12O40], [H5PMo10V2O40], [H4PW12O40], [PW9O34], [V4O12] and so on.148,150,152,153

Motivated by the doping strategy that has been widespread in ameliorating conventional Li-rich layered oxides (Ni, Co, and Mn) and Ti-based anode materials, bimetallic MOPs are investigated to ameliorate the coordination conditions and present better electrochemical performance than monometallic systems.154–158 One possible way to generate isostructural bimetallic MOPs is to utilize two metal ions with comparable ionic radii such as Zn (II, 0.74 Å) and Co (II, 0.72 Å). An isostructural CoZn-ZIF is prepared by 64% Co2+ substitution of Zn2+ in the Zn-ZIF-8 crystal.159 Hu et al. reported that only one Li+ per unit can be intercalated into the imidazole rings of pristine ZIFs, however, theoretically, over four Li+ per unit could be inserted into the CoZn-ZIF due to four N atoms per unit participating in lithium ion storage. Interestingly, when CoZn-ZIF anodes are processed in the charge/discharge process, the Co–N bonds reversibly break/regenerate, while Zn–N bonds remain the same as in the redox process of Zn-ZIF-8. Upon setting the current density at 100 mA g−1 and potential windows within 0.01 to 3.0 V (vs. Li/Li+), the CoZn-ZIF delivers a stable capacity of 605.8 mA h g−1 over 100 cycles, while Zn-ZIF-8 and Co-ZIF-67 only exhibit the capacities of 94.8 mA h g−1 and 122 mA h g−1, respectively. Another method is to introduce a certain amount of larger metal ions to broaden the interlayer distance and support a stable structure. In this way, enough space for ion diffusion and a reduction of charge-transfer resistance are ensured.160,161 A simple microwave-assisted method, where HCl is utilized to adjust the morphology of MOFs, is applied to synthesize Zn doped Ni-MOFs. During the synthesis process, crystal growth and agglomeration are controlled by the amount of doped Zn ions and modulator HCl. As a result, a honeycomb-like hierarchical spherical Zn-doped Ni-MOF is obtained and the interlayers are enlarged by ∼0.09 nm. When the ratio is Zn/Ni = 0.07, high capacities of 237.4 mA h g−1 (1 A g−1) and 122.3 mA h g−1 (20 A g−1) are obtained, respectively. A similar approach has been adopted to prepare Co-doped Mn-BTC and Zn-doped Fe-BDC@300, which exhibit a high capacity of 901 mA h g−1 after 150 cycles and 863.4 mA h g−1 over 120 cycles, respectively, within 0.01–3.0 V (vs. Li/Li+) at 100 mA g−1 (Fig. 4c and d show the example of Fe(Zn)-BDC@300).126,231
3.2 Tuning and functionalization of bridging ligands
It is believed that redox-active organic ligands play a more important role than metal nodes, concerning how to achieve prominent battery performance including good cyclability and high capacities. The metal-node-transfer redox electrons through the alternation between different oxidation states could lead to lower coordination stabilities with ligands, and the amount of electrons transferred is smaller due to the limited stable oxidation states of metal ions. However, organic ligands undergo lithium-ion insertion/extraction at the free functional groups, which has little influence on the whole coordination structure, ensuring an integrated structure even at high/low potential. Moreover, redox-active linkers can be able to provide various intercalation sites, resulting in higher specific capacity. Therefore, the discussion about optional bridging ligands among redox-active MOPs is essential.

Table 1 presents a list of MOP-based electrode materials classified according to the types of organic ligands. The molecular information and battery performance are also included. In addition, the previously reported functional carboxyl ligands are explained in detail in the last section. As for the synergistic effect from aromatic rings and N-functional groups at organic spacers, Chen et al. designed a new bi-functionalized MOF (BMOF), composed of Zn(IM)1.5(abIM)0.5, which combines the hydrophobic and rigid merits of phenyl as well as the redox active N atoms of amine and imidazolate. The presence of the phenyl groups in the framework is able to increase the chemical and thermal stability. When treated in aqueous and organic solution at 60 °C for 15 days, the BMOF still presents the same powder XRD peak as original samples. Also, after exposing the BMOF to 200 °C in air for 3 days, it still retains an intact structure. Additionally, there are host–guest interactions between –NH2 or N atoms and Li+ ions, which help the BMOF to serve as an anode for LIBs. It exhibits about 190 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1 after 200 cycles and the value is equal to that of the 2nd cycle. Additionally, when cycled at 400 mA h g−1, the coulombic efficiency approaches 100% after 200 cycles.122 Due to the vital progress of 2D electronic conductive MOF analogues in battery studies, the following paragraphs will focus on two meaningful ligands: (1) hexaaminobenzene (HAB) (Fig. 4g) and (2) benzenehexathiol (BHT) (Fig. 4h).

Starting from HAB ligands, electrically conductive 2D-HAB-CPs have been studied in a great number of energy storage devices, ranging from experimental to computational investigations. As there is strong π–π interaction among the layers of M-HAB CPs (M = NiII, CuII and CoII) nanosheets, a single layer cannot be obtained and samples are described as thick (about 1–2 mm) or thin (lower than 10 nm).197 Porous 2D crystalline Ni3(HAB)2 and Cu3(HAB)2 MOFs are confirmed with excellent bulk electronic conductivities over 800 S m−1, verifying a partially occupied delocalized band of Fermi energy.198 2D CoII-HAB MOFs achieved fast Na+ storage capability up to 214 mA h g−1 at 2 A g−1 within 0.5–3.0 V (vs. Na/Na+), mainly because of their high bulk electrical conductivity (1.57 S cm−1).97 Thanks to ultra-small HAB linkers, after coordination with Cu(II) and Ni(II), a highly dense packed framework with outstanding volumetric capacitance (>760 F cm−3) and gravimetric capacitance (>400 F g−1) at the 50 μm electrode thickness is obtained.199 Additionally, theoretical DFT calculation of 2D-HAB-CPs can also be conducted to investigate their promising application in Li–S cathodes.200
According to a previous study, d8 transition metal ions tend to form square-planar coordination complexes and BHT ligands provide multi-chelating sites through a preferred equilateral-triangular direction. According to these theoretical results, 2D-BHT-CP π-stacking nanosheets are expected to be produced.164 In 2004, Nishihara et al. found that Ni-bis(dithiolene) nanosheets with a conductivity of 1.6 × 102 S cm−1 offered a foothold for further study.201 Zhou et al. paid attention to 2D Cu-BHT CPs and applied them as Li–S battery cathodes and catalysts.67,182,202,203 They found that Cu-BHT CP nanosheets, with the formula [Cu3(C6S6)]n, present a high conductivity value of 1580 S cm−1 at RT, induced by strong d–π conjugation and numerous delocalized electrons in the 2D plane.182 In addition, they also prepared novel 2D Ag–S networks, composed of [Ag5(C6S6)]n CP layers, which demonstrate a high conductivity of ∼250 S cm−1 at 300 K.204 In summary, future work could aim at Li+/Na+ storage based on BHT ligands – CP materials.205 Since the bridging ligands have a strong relationship with electrical conductivity and battery performance, preferential attention is required to focus on the selection and synthesis of suitable organic ligands.
3.3 Control and enhancement of electronic conductivity
MOFs, prevailing over existing electrode materials (carbon-based, LixMyOzx/y/z ≥ 0, polyanion compounds and so on) with limited porous structure and chemical constituents,17,206 have been rapidly developed for application in energy storage and conversion devices due to the combination of rich ordered porosity and dispersed multi-redox active sites. The unique and abundant pores provide fast ion-diffusion channels and large contact areas between electrolytes and redox-reaction locus (metal nodes and bridging ligands). Therefore, theoretically, ∼100% utilization of whole MOFs could be obtained to accomplish superior energy/power density. However, even though a large number of electrons can be produced by the redox-reaction and ligand doping processes, the intrinsic insulation properties of MOFs trap some of these electrons and block them from transporting to the external circuit. There are two proposed methods to solve this problem: (1) adding exterior conductive agents, including conducting carbon black, carbon nanotubes,108,176 functionalized graphene/reduced graphene oxide,127,134,148,163,207–209 conductive polymers,210–212 metal nanoparticles213 and so on; and (2) enhancing interior conductivity via constructing electron and charge flowing routes based on each framework joint. The first way, which has been widely used in traditional and commercially available LiCoO2/LiMn2O4/LiFePO4 electrodes, could be applied to MOF electrodes. Among those conductive species, chemically modified CNTs and RGO, especially with carboxyl groups, could not only enhance the electron-conductive properties but also act as the precursors to build further frameworks and morphologies. The interconnected electron/ion transport pathways among Co2(OH)2BDC MOFs and COOH-graphene (named CoCGr) are realized by chelating the –COOH groups in COOH-graphene and Co2+ through an in situ solvothermal treatment, where the localized state of three free electrons in high-spin Co2+ nodes is converted to a delocalized state once Li+ ion impregnation occurs (Fig. 4e and f).163 CoCGr-5 (5 wt% of carboxyl graphene) presents a smaller semicircle in the EIS test (less than 20 Ω) than that of pristine Co2(OH)2BDC (about 60 Ω), demonstrating a reduced resistance among electrodes. The enhanced electron-conducting ability is helpful to achieve an improved rate capability. Pristine Co2(OH)2BDC and CoCGr-5, when cycled between 0.01 and 3.0 V in LIBs, present ∼1081 mA h g−1 and ∼1331 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1, ∼937 mA h g−1 and ∼1307 mA h g−1 at 200 mA g−1, ∼784 mA h g−1 and ∼1195 mA h g−1 at 400 mA g−1, ∼644 mA h g−1 and ∼1089 mA h g−1 at 600 mA g−1, ∼457 mA h g−1 and ∼919 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1, and ∼248 mA h g−1 and ∼555 mA h g−1 at 2 A g−1, respectively. Additionally, the CoCGr-5 electrode exhibits long cycling life, by maintaining a capacity of 818 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1 after 400 cycles. Yang et al.207 utilized terephthalic acid-GO to provide effective nucleation sites and a structure-guiding template to grow Mn-MOFs. The reversible discharge capacity of Mn-MOF/RGO stabilizes at ∼432 mA h g−1 (500 mA g−1) and 348 mA h g−1 (1000 mA g−1) after 500 cycles (0.01–3 V vs. Li/Li+). Besides increasing electrical conductivity, the variation of material morphology could also occur with the loading of carbon species. After decorating Ni(TA) (Ni2-trimesic acid) with COOH-MWCNT through a hydrothermal synthesis process, 2 to 5 μm microspherical Ni(TA) particles with low surface areas totally turn into flower-shaped-cluster sheets with a thickness of only ∼13 nm.108 The specific capacity increases from 94 mA h g−1 Ni(TA) to 115 mA h g−1 MWCNTs@Ni(TA) at 2 A g−1.
In conclusion, anchored MOFs with functionalized CNTs/RGO show several advantages including: (1) enhanced electron-conductivity, and therefore higher rate capability; (2) the avoidance of MOF particle self-aggregation during the synthesis process; (3) buffered volume expansion during the lithiation/delithiation process; (4) optimized material morphologies and pore structures via adjusting carbon species concentration; and (5) improved mechanical flexibility due to the additives of soft carbon. However, the exterior conductive additives are inactive and account for volume and mass percentage of the electrode, which leads to a lower energy density (MJ kg−1, MJ L−1) of the whole electrode. Therefore, a simple and stable way to counteract the low intrinsic electronic conductivity of MOFs should be taken to overcome the low level of effective lithiation/de-lithiation at high current density.
Many MOFs are intrinsically insulating due to their localized electrons in atoms or bonds that cannot flow along molecular orbitals, letting alone to the external circuit.214 Several related reviews on conductive MOFs have summarized the general design principles, experiment strategies, and characterization techniques to help switching on their electron-conductivity.215–217 The following will mainly focus on recent conductive MOFs that have been used as reversible electrode materials.
The important property of this category of MOFs is that they display a good stability in severe chemical environments, such as over high/low potential and current, various organic/inorganic electrolyte solvents and solutes, repeatable lithiation/delithiation processes over many cycles and so on. In order to effectively utilize the electronic conductivity of MOFs while maintaining their unique frameworks during the electrochemical reaction process, 2D conductive networks are realized by extending p–π/d–π conjugation in-plane for overlapping π orbitals between organic ligands and metal nodes, and conduction takes place through π–π stacking interactions between layers.218 Bao et al. firstly prepared 2D conductive Co-HAB MOFs (HAB = hexaaminobenzene) for sodium ion storage, where three electrons and Na+ could be reversibly stored at each HAB ligand, showing a theoretical capacity of 312 mA h g−1.97 The extended d–π conjugation in the 2D plane generates a bulk electrical-conductivity of ∼1.57 S cm−1 as well as a high power of 214 mA h g−1 (in 7 min) or 152 mA h g−1 (in 45 s). What's more, the same HAB ligands have been used to fabricate Cu-HAB and Ni-HAB, exhibiting 11 ± 3 S m−1 and 70 ± 15 S m−1 at room temperature (RT) respectively, through a similar d–π conjugation theory.199 Additionally, 2D MOFs constructed by a π–π stacking layered structure also play an important role in overcoming their insulating limitation. Ni3(HITP)2 (HITP = 2,3,6,7,10,11-hexaiminotriphenylene) is reported as the first neat MOF electrode solely working for electrochemical double layer capacitors (EDLCs).219 Delocalized electrons can flow through the π–π conjugated electron cloud between 2D layers of Ni3(HITP)2 and over 5000 S m−1 of bulk electrical conductivity is presented. Ni3(HITP)2 electrodes exhibit a value of ∼18 μF cm−2 for normalized specific surface area capacitance. They also show a 90% capacitance retention in the range of 0–1 V at 2 A g−1 after 104 cycles. Similar 2D π–π conjugated stacking sheets appear in an electron-conducting iMOF (2,6-Naph(COOLi)2, 2,6-naphthalene dicarboxylate dilithium), specifically in repeating π-stacking naphthalene layers.220,221 A full battery is assembled when the iMOF is applied as a negative electrode and LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 as a positive electrode in a laminate-type cell. The specific energy/power density can reach up to 300 W h kg−1 and 5 kW kg−1, respectively. Also, the capacity can retain 96% after 100 charge/discharge cycles. Ogihara et al. found that the crystal order of the iMOF could be controlled and adjusted by post-annealing treatment, where the generation of impurities in layers could be avoided during the molecular self-assembly process. It is revealed that post-annealing at 623 K under an Ar atmosphere is an effective way to reduce the length of the c-axis, which reflects the distance of π–π stacking naphthalene interlayers, so that iMOF electrodes show lower internal resistance and higher specific capacities.173
3.4 Realization of high operating voltage-cathode applications
As the significant component in the whole battery, the cathode mainly decides the working voltage range of batteries and thus the overall energy density. In order to satisfy the market demand for portable energy devices, some commercially available cathode materials, such as LiCoO2 and LiFePO4, have been developed. But their limited capacity (∼150 mA h g−1) and variable structures at high operating potentials are the driving forces to search for novel cathode materials for the enhancement of energy densities. MOFs, combining the merits of (1) co-redox active metal nodes and bridging ligands, (2) ordered and tunable pores and channels, and (3) the robust framework during the lithiation/delithiation process, become desirable cathodes with multi-electron transfer reactions, fast ion diffusion kinetics, and stable structures during the charge/discharge process. In other words, MOFs could be used as cathode materials with high energy density, power density and long cycling life.
In order to find more novel MOF-cathode materials, some researchers paid attention to high valent metal ions as center nodes, such as V(IV), Fe(III), Al(III) and so on. A 4 V K2.5[(VO)2(HPO4)1.5(PO4)0.5(C2O4)] MOF-based cathode was synthesized by Vittal et al., consisting of a distorted octahedral VIVO6 core. K+ ions will release upon charging, with subsequent cycles being Li+ insertion/extraction from the framework rather than heavier and bigger K+. Besides the ion exchange, V(IV) ions exhibit a V4+/V5+ redox reaction. Reversible capacities of 68 mA h g−1 (0.4C), 58 mA h g−1 (1C), and 40 mA h g−1 (2C) (where 1C = 108 mA g−1) are obtained between 2.5 V and 4.6 V (Vs. Li/Li+) after 60 cycles.106 In another case, Li2(VO)2(HPO4)2(C2O4), with Li+ ion intercalation and V4+/5+ redox reactions during the charge/discharge process presents a charge/discharge capacity of 83/80 mA h g−1 at the 25th cycle together with a CE of 97% at 0.1C (1C = 125 mA g−1) between 2.5 V and 4.5 V (vs. Li/Li+).107 MIL-47(V), with the formula [VIV(O)(bdc)], is able to display a capacity of 82 mA h g−1 accompanied by ∼100% CE at 10 mA g−1 between 1.5 and 4.0 V (vs. Li/Li+).105 NCHU-3, [Ga2(VO)3K2(H2O)3(C2H4P2O6)4(H2O)13], featuring redox oxovanadyl centers, demonstrates a stable cyclability over 200 cycles at the voltage of 3–5 V.222 In addition, FeIII-based MOFs, including MIL-101, MIL-100 and MIL-53, can take up ∼0.62Li ions or Na ions per Fe node above 1.5 V (vs. Li/Li+, Na/Na+). Yamada et al. proposed the usage of MIL-101(Fe) cathodes, observing a discharge capacity of 107 mA h g−1 in the voltage range of 2.0–4.2 V at 0.02C and a stable capacity of 72 mA h g−1 at the 100th cycle at 0.2C.223 Tarascon et al. chose MIL-53(Fe) as a cathode candidate with a specific capacity of 75 mA h g−1 and 140 mA h L−1 between 1.5 V and 3.5 V (vs. Li/Li+) at 0.025C, ascribed to the reversible redox reaction of FeIII/FeII as well as the insertion/extraction of Li+ ions.98 Gallis et al. investigated the positive electrode performance of MIL-100(Fe) cathodes for sodium ion storage, showing the best performance at 1 M NaClO4 in EC:PC:DME. The initial capacity of about 55 mA h g−1 in the voltage range of 1.5–4.0 V (vs. Na/Na+) at 0.1C is obtained, which is equal to about 0.6 Na/Fe and near to the intercalation of other Fe-MOFs in LIBs.170 What's more, Lee et al. firstly introduced P(THBQ-Al) coordination polymers (THBQ = tetrahydroxybenzoquinone) into sodium-ion batteries as cathodes, resulting in a specific capacity of ∼113 mA h g−1 at 20 mA g−1 among 1.5–3 V (vs. Na/Na+) and maintaining a stable capacity over 100 cycles.179 Additionally, the incorporation of a disulfide ligand in Cu-MOFs is another strategy to improve the working voltage.224 The total capacity comes from the reversible cleavage/reformation of the S–S bond on ligands and the Cu2+/Cu+ redox reaction in metal nodes, which brings a theoretical value of 216 mA h g−1 for [Cu(C2O4)(C10H8N2S2)] without any H2O. In the experiment, a 2nd discharge capacity of 175 mA h g−1 at the current density of 50 mA g−1 between 2.4 V and 4.1 V (vs. Li/Li+) is obtained, and 68% capacity is maintained until 50 cycles.
Besides the above-mentioned cathode candidates, the following research also displays excellent positive electrode performance. CuITCNQ (TCNQ = 7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane) was demonstrated as a cathode material for SIBs for the first time by Huang et al.180 The reversible reaction, where TCNQ moieties transfer two redox electrons and CuI/CuII redox couples provide one electron, delivers a theoretical capacity of nearly 300 mA h g−1. The electrochemical reaction process of CuTCNQ is shown as follows: (1) at the charge process, there is an oxidization of CuITCNQ/TCNQ0 + CuI (OCV – 3.8 V) and CuI/CuII (3.8–4.1 V), and (2) at the discharge process, there is a reduction of CuII/CuI (4.1–3.7 V), TCNQ0 + CuI/CuITCNQ (3.7–3.0 V), and CuITCNQ/[CuI(TCNQ)2−]− (3.0–2.0 V). It is shown that the existence of Cu–N bonds has two functions: (1) to maintain the stability of TCNQ ligands and (2) to improve the redox potential. A specific capacity of 255 mA h g−1 is obtained at 20 mA g−1 within 2.0–4.1 V (vs. Na/Na+), which approximates to the capacity of a three-electron reaction. When tested at 50 mA g−1, it exhibits 214 mA h g−1 at the 1st cycle and shows good capacity retention until the 50th cycle. Awaga et al. adopted 2,7-anthraquinonedicarboxylic acid as a ligand to fabricate a new MOF-based cathode material, [Cu(2,7-AQDC)(DMF)]·x(DMF).129 This Cu(2,7-AQDC) MOF displays a three-electron movement during the whole redox reaction and the theoretical capacity is about 162 mA h g−1. Its capacity reaches 147 mA h g−1 at initial cycles and remains at ∼105 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles at 1 mA between 1.7 V and 4 V (vs. Li/Li+). Long et al. designed an Fe2(dobpdc) MOF, consisting of dobpdc4− ligands (=4,4′-dioxidobiphenyl-3,3′-dicarboxylate) and Fe(II) metal nodes, opening the door for reversible uptake/release of electrolyte anions.174 Even though the metal nodes and organic moieties could be oxidized, only the former presents a full reversibility. Interestingly, the insertion of larger anions in the framework endows the cathode with a higher operating potential. It exhibits a stable capacity of ∼90 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles at 1C (1C = 140 mA h g−1) between 2.0 V and 3.65 V (vs. Na/Na+). In addition, Cu-TCA (TCA = tricarboxytriphenyl amine),128 Cd(II)-DPNDI MOFs,194 and bis(diimino)nickel coordination frameworks132 have also been applied as LIB electrodes with good electrochemical performance at stable high working voltages.
3.5 A particular family member of MOPs – PBAs
Prussian blue (PB) and Prussian blue analogous (PBAs) are a large subclass of porous coordination polymers with diverse applications in energy storage devices. As the initially synthesized MOPs, Prussian blue (Fe4[Fe(CN)6]3xH2O)] is established by repeating cubic units consisting of mixing-valent FeIII/FeII nodes and cyano ligands.225 When iron metal ions are replaced by other transition metal ions, Prussian blue analogous (PBAs) are formed. PB and PBAs, with the general formula AaBxB′y(CN)6·nH2O (A = alkali metal ions, B/B′ = transition metal ions), present a fast-ion diffusion kinetics in the solid state, which is contributed by their open hollow frameworks and robust structures. Moreover, for PB and PBAs, Li+, Na+, and even larger multivalent cations (such as K+, Mg2+, and Al3+) can be reversibly inserted/released and transported through their ion-diffusion channels, in contrast to other inorganic electrode materials.1 Therefore, the exceptional capability of controllable atomic compositions, peculiar channel structures, and the ability to load different size guest molecules allow PB and PBAs not only to be applied in LIBs and SIBs, but also to be extended to novel battery systems such as K-ion batteries, Mg-ion batteries, and anion intercalation based-batteries. Some pioneering reports have already reviewed and summarized PBAs and their derivative nano-materials in energy conversion and storage, including their multi-fold hollow architectures, optimized aqueous and organic electrolyte systems, applications in diverse battery systems, electrochemical catalysis, and so on.226–229 Here, recent efforts in the compositional design and structure modification of crystal PBAs will be mainly concluded for sodium-ion batteries and lithium-ion batteries in organic electrolytes.
Since the primary electrochemical characteristics of PB batteries have been illuminated by Neff in 1985, PB and its analogues have experienced ever-increasing development in rechargeable batteries.232–234 Goodenough et al. found that KMFe(CN)6 (M = Fe, Mn, Ni, Co and Zn), as shown in Fig. 5a, exhibits a capacity of ∼100 mA h g−1 at 0.05C during 2.0–4.0 V (vs. Na/Na+) in organic carbonate electrolyte because sodium ions can reversibly intercalate into PBAs accompanied by redox conversion of FeIII/FeII.230 Then, they synthesized Na–Mn hexacyanoferrate compounds (NMHFC) with a high redox potential of 3.4 V (vs. Na/Na+, organic electrolyte).235 The substitution of sodium ions in the iron cyanide complex has a capability to shift the Fe(III)/Fe(II) redox couple to the Mn(III)/Mn(II) couple and stabilize more positive charge on Mn ions. Correspondingly, there are Fe(III)/Fe(II) and Mn(III)/Mn(II) redox couples separately located at low and high voltage, as well as reversible Na+ uptake/removal during the charge/discharge process. So, a reversible capacity of ∼120 mA h g−1 after 30 cycles at 1/20C (1C = 120 mA g−1) within 2–4.2 V (vs. Na/Na+) is obtained, indicating that NMHFC is a promising cathode candidate for SIBs. After that, Na-rich PBA cathode materials, such as Na4Fe(CN)6 (2014), Na2MnII[MnII(CN)6 (2014), Na-rich NaxFeFe(CN)6 (2015), Na2CoFe(CN)6 (2018), NaxM[Fe(CN)6]·nH2O (M = Fe, Mn, Ni, and Co) (2018) and so on, have become ever-increasingly attractive electrode materials in organic Na+ ion batteries.236–240 Besides, the tunability of chemical compositions can also be achieved by developing Na2Ni[Fe(CN)6, Na2VOx[Fe(CN)6], Zn3Na2[FeII(CN)6]2, Cu/Fe PBAs, V/Fe PBAs, Ni-doping Na4Fe(CN)6, etc.162,241–247 Interestingly, Han et al. prepared novel PBAs-NixCo1−x[Fe(CN)6] (x = 0, 0.1, 0.2……1.0) and employed them in a full cell with an anode material NaTi2(PO4)3 (NTP).248 The full-cell performance of HQ-NiCoFe (x = 0.3)/NTP exhibits a practical specific capacity of ∼140 mA h g−1 at 15 mA g−1 between 0.5 V and 2.2 V, which is close to the theoretical capacity of 145 mA h g−1 (1.68 Na per unit), a good capacity retention, and ∼100% CE after 300 cycles at 150 mA g−1. During the sodiation/desodiation process, there are reversible Fe2+/Fe3+ and Co2+/Co3+ redox reactions for inputting/outputting electrons, suggesting the presence of redox inactive Ni in PBAs. The great electrochemical performance of HQ-Ni0.3Co0.7[Fe(CN)6] results from two aspects: (1) the introduction of inactive Ni reduces lattice variation and then cures capacity recession, and (2) fewer Fe(CN)6 vacancies and H2O in HQ-PBA frameworks. One of the effective post-treatment approaches to tailor PBAs' morphology and active Na+ storage sites is via the tunable etching methods by selectively adding NaOH or HCl into PBA solution.249–251 Mai et al. proposed a defect-induced mechanism that stimulates a morphology change from nanocube to nanoflower through dispersing pristine NaxNiFe(CN)6 nanocubes into NaOH solution, followed by sonication (Fig. 5b).249 During the extended etching process along each face, the edges of NiHCF-cubes gradually dissolve and recrystallize. Finally, the nanocubes are transformed into nanosheets and then nanoflowers. Meanwhile, ∼300 nm bulk NiHCF-cubes are reduced into 100–200 nm internal cubes. At the rate of 1.1C (1C = 90 mA g−1) within 2.0–4.0 V (vs. Na/Na+), the 2nd cycle capacity of NiHCF-etch (1.0 Na per f.u., ∼90 mA h g−1) is higher than that of NiHCF-cube (0.73 Na per f.u., ∼66 mA h g−1). Additionally, the capacity retention rate after 5000 cycles at 5.5C of the NiHCF-etch and NiHCF-cube is ∼83.2% and ∼76.9%, respectively. The above data reveal that post-etching treatment can be effective, in other words, the sodium-ion diffusion kinetics of optimized nanoflower NiHCF-etch samples is faster than that of original NiHCF-cubes during the process of sodiation/desodiation. What's more, adding PVP in etching solution that will adjust the size distribution of PBAs by controlling the etching rate,251 mixing ascorbic acid and acetic acid in PBA solution under a certain heat treatment that will fabricate hierarchical hollow architecture,252 inhibitor control that will prepare a border-rich structure,253 and other strategies254,255 have been verified and could guide future research.256

Attractively, PBAs also feature a high lithium insertion/extraction voltage (∼3 V vs. Li/Li+, organic electrolyte), inspiring people to explore and improve their LIB performance.257 Yang et al. reported nanocubic FeFe(CN)6 crystals with well-arranged lattice defects, demonstrating a high specific capacity of 160 mA h g−1 (about 1.8Li+ ions per unit) and an energy density of about 500 W h kg−1 at 0.15C (1C = 160 mA g−1) within 2.0–4.3 V (vs. Li/Li+), a capacity value of 102 mA h g−1 at a very high rate of 24C (up to ∼3840 mA g−1), and a stable long cycling life over 300 cycles with 90% capacity retention at 3C.258 Long et al. showed a Tb(H2O)5[W(CN)8] coordination polymer as a lithium storage cathode between 2.5 V and 4.3 V (vs. Li/Li+), with redox couples of [WV(CN)8]3−/[WIV(CN)8]4− at 3.3 V and ∼70% reversible Li+ intercalation at initial cycles.259 Yagi et al. quantitatively revealed the redox active intercalation of PF6− anions and Li+ cations in a PB battery.260 Talham et al. investigated a core–shell structured CuFe-PBA@NiFe-PBA as a cathode in LIBs, involving stepwise redox reactions of Fe3+/2+ (CuFe-PBA), Fe3+/2+ (NiFe-PBA), and Cu2+/+ (CuFe-PBA).261 Apart from acting as positive electrodes, PBAs still present excellent negative-electrode performance in LIBs.262–265
In conclusion, PBA-related electrode materials bring an interesting and broad realm of battery chemistry. This section may provide some practical strategies for further advanced research to achieve more remarkable charge/discharge performance.
3.6 Other approaches
Several main strategies for enhancing the electrochemical performance of MOPs materials have been summarized above. Rational design and fabrication of MOP materials basically take the metal centers and bridging segments into account in order to prepare extraordinary electrode candidates with thermal/chemical consistency, electric/ionic conductivity, high operating voltage, and multiple redox-active sites. Furthermore, an overall consideration could be taken toward multi-dimensional porous structures, particle size, various morphologies, and so on. The porous channels of MOPs are important transfer pathways for mobile protons or ions.16 When talking about the pore structure among MOP frameworks, the pore radius, pore shape, and whether guest molecules occupy the pores are three issues, which need to be addressed.94,105,266 Meanwhile, multi-dimensional MOPs, which could be regulated through controlling the crystal growth direction, are another focus when designing the whole structure.267 Compared with 1D particles87,268 and 3D porous frameworks, 2D layer structures have become increasingly attractive in recent studies.14,69,90–92,123,124 2D layer-by-layer deposited nanosheets, usually featuring ultra-thin thickness and ultra-high specific areas, are able to offer numerous accessible reactive sites and have the potential to manufacture electrically conductive networks.14,269 Furthermore, conventional 2D conductive materials, such as graphene, are restricted by their component elements and difficulty in proceeding post-modification, while 2D conductive MOP materials are attractive because of the diversity in their composition and easy tailoring.197
It is feasible to control nanosized particles and their morphologies by adjusting synthetic conditions.15 The controlled nano-particles and morphologies directly influence the contact interfaces between electrodes and electrolyte, which shortens the electron/charge diffusion distance and hence determines the rate of the electrochemical reaction.223,270 Xu et al. reported sub-5 nm Co-MOF crystals pulverized from bulk particles by coating protective PPy and subsequent calcination treatment (Fig. 6a).212 The ultrasmall nanocrystals crucially increase the solid/liquid interface areas and especially improve their fast charge/discharge ability at high current rates. At 0.2 A g−1 in the voltage window of 0.01–3 V (Li/Li+), the capacity of the 2nd cycle is 1201 mA h g−1 with a CE of over 95%, and the capacity of the 100th cycle is 1192 mA h g−1 with a CE of about 99%. They also show an excellent rate capability as revealed by their high capacities of 1301 mA h g−1 (0.1 A g−1), 1188 mA h g−1 (0.2 A g−1), 1060 mA h g−1 (0.5 A g−1), 987 mA h g−1 (1 A g−1), 906 mA h g−1 (2 A g−1), 801 mA h g−1 (5 A g−1), 701 mA h g−1 (10 A g−1), and 596 mA h g−1 (20 A g−1).

Morphology-dependent synthesis routes of MOPs are substantially allied with the specific capacity and cycling performance.85 Up to now, MOPs have been demonstrated to show varied morphologies and distinguished battery performance. From nanorods (Fe-MIL-88B (Fig. 6b),167 CoHNta CPs),187 needles (Fe PCN-600 MOFs (Fig. 6c)),181 nanosheets (CotII-terephthalate-based MOFs (Fig. 6d)),124 nanowires (Co-CPs (Fig. 6f)),93 pillars (MnII and CoII-MOFs),195,271 ellipsoids (Ni3(HCOO)6/CNTs),176 tremella-like structures (Al-fumarate based MOFs)140 to more complicated appearances such as honeycomblike Zn/Ni-MOFs (Fig. 6h)160 and flower-like Ni(BTC) MOFs,109 all have been confirmed to display the valid effects of smart morphology adjustment. Apart from accommodating salt concentrations and treatment temperatures, porous carbon materials (graphene and CNTs) have also been used as templates for the growth of specific shapes to enhance Li+/Na+ storage capacity.108,207 An interesting morphology evolution toward Co-BDC MOFs has been reported by different groups, confirming that the modified morphology is helpful for improving the electrode performance. For example, Li et al. synthesized Co2(OH)2BDC MOFs with a large bulk grain structure, exhibiting a capacity of ∼650 mA h g−1 at 50 mA g−1 between 0.02 V and 3.0 V (Li/Li+) after 100 cycles. In a following study, Hu et al. prepared seashell-like Co2(OH)2BDC MOFs and employed them as LIB anodes (0.01–3.0 V) (Fig. 6g).95 The hierarchical seashell-like structure has two merits: (1) containing many cavities inside for storing more electrolyte, and (2) decreasing ion diffusion resistance because of the high contact specific surface area. A capacity of 1021 mA h g−1 after 200 cycles, 601 mA h g−1 after 700 cycles and 435 mA h g−1 after 1000 cycles are obtained at 100 mA g−1, 500 mA g−1 and 1 A g−1, respectively, showing stable ultra-long cyclability and high-rate discharge ability. In the same year, they also reported shale-shaped Co(1,4-BDC)(DMF)0.61 MOF microcrystals, which display a capacity of 1090.2 mA h g−1 at 200 mA g−1 after 100 cycles and a capacity of 611 mA h g−1 at 1000 mA g−1 in the voltage window of 0.01–3.0 V (Vs. Li/Li+) after 200 cycles. More recently, Wei et al. presented hierarchical Co2(OH)2BDC microflowers (formed by aggregation of many small nanoflakes) (Fig. 6e), and tested them as anodes for LIBs (0.01–3.0 V).113 Owing to their unique microflower morphologies and high specific areas, the lithium storage capacity could reach up to 1345 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 after 100 cycles, and 828 mA h g−1 at 2 A g−1 after 700 cycles.
4. Promotion of other advanced applications
For the development of diverse energy storage and conversion devices, pristine MOFs and CPs have been used as active elements in many promising systems, such as Li–S batteries, Li–O2 batteries, solar cells, fuel cells, supercapacitors and so on.13,64,65,200,218,272–280 Early reviews have already summarized several of these emerging applications. Here, the development of other cation-based batteries (K+, Zn2+, and Mg2+) will be typically highlighted.
The reason for replacing traditional graphite anodes comes from their low gravimetric capacity (372 mA h g−1), poor rate performance and inability to accommodate larger ions than Li+/Na+ while maintaining an intact structure. However, CPs (particularly PBAs) hold great advantages in accommodating various cations via their unique nanopores and cross-linked channels.18,281–288 Most importantly, they are facile to synthesize and have low cost.289
A mono-valent K+ ion battery, an organic K+ ion battery, based on a typical PBA-Co3[Co(CN)6]2 anode, was reported and found to exhibit a favorable performance of 324.5 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1 in the voltage range of 0.05–2 V (vs. K/K+) and ∼82% capacity retention rate after 200 cycles.290 A rate capacity of 221 mA h g−1 is also obtained at a high current density of 1000 mA g−1. This significant work reveals a multistep potassiation/depotassiation process at C–Co and N–Co redox active sites, which is controlled by solid-state diffusion. An initial irreversible K+ insertion step and subsequent reversible K+ uptake/removal process are shown as follows: CoII3[CoIII(CN)6]2 + 10K+ + 10e− → 3Co0 + 2K5CoI(CN)6(5) Co0 + K5CoI(CN)6 − 2K+ − 2e− ↔ K3CoII[CoI(CN)6], (0.47 V, vs. K/K+)(6) K3CoII[CoI(CN)6] − K+ − e− ↔ K2CoII[CoII(CN)6], (1.23 V, vs. K/K+)(7) K2CoII[CoII(CN)6] − K+ − e− ↔ KCoII[CoIII(CN)6], (1.7 V, vs. K/K+)(8)
Therefore, eight mole electrons per unit could be offered among reactions (6)–(8), and the value of theoretical capacity is up to 354 mA h g−1. With regard to organic KIB cathodes, Goodenough et al. also proposed to use KxMnFe(CN)6 (0 ≤ x ≤ 2) for storing K+ ions at a working plateau of 3.6 V via two redox couples such as MnIII/MnII or FeIII/FeII.291 This PBA-based cathode presents a discharge capacity of 142.4 mA h g−1 at a rate of 0.2C within 2.5–4.6 V (vs. K/K+), close to its theoretical capacity of ∼156 mA h g−1 (about 2 K+ per unit).
Secondly, multivalent-cation batteries show the merits of abundant conservation on earth, ultra-safety and high energy density (e.g. the theoretical gravimetric and volumetric capacity of Mg metal anodes could reach 2205 A h kg−1 and 3833 mA h cm−3, respectively). Their usage in aqueous and organic electrolytes has been widely increased after the introduction of chemically/thermally stable CPs (PBAs).292–295 To avoid the inert phase conversion at Mg metal surfaces and improve the ion diffusion kinetics at both sides of the electrodes, an MgSO4-based aqueous electrolyte, a polyimide anode and a PBA cathode are designed and fabricated to realize magnesium-ion storage devices via reversible enolization at negative polyimide electrodes and Mg2+ insertion/extraction at the positive PBA electrodes.296 This full aqueous Mg ion battery has an energy density of about 33 W h kg−1, close to the theoretical capacity of 48 W h kg−1, at 1 A g−1 in the voltage range of 0–1.55 V (vs. Mg/Mg2+),and ∼100% capacity retention after 100 cycles at 2 A g−1. However, it suffers from the limited stable operation window (~1.2 V) as well as non-redox active ion intercalation (protons and H3O+), negative metal corrosion in acid electrolytes and the formation of insulated ZnO layers, so the aqueous electrolyte system of the zinc ion battery cannot avoid low utilization of Zn ions, poor cyclability, and low discharge capacity/charge capacity rate (CE). In order to address these issues, Hong et al. studied an organic electrolyte (0.5 M Zn(ClO4)2 in acetonitrile solvent) for rechargeable Zn ions batteries, where KNF-086 PBAs are used as positive electrodes(Fig. 7).297 It is revealed that Zn2+ ions are inserted into the interstitial cavities of the PBA crystal, delivering an initial capacity of 55.6 mA h g−1 at a rate of 0.2C (1C = 56 mA g−1) within 0.7–1.8 V (vs. Zn/Zn2+) and a high CE of over 99.9%. Indeed, a PBA-based electrode is not a prerequisite in organic multivalent-cation batteries. For example, α-Mo3S11 CP also exhibits the reversible magnesiation/demagnesiation ability at the terminal redox active S–S moieties, displaying a discharge capacity of 115 mA h g−1 at the 1st cycle at 10 mA g−1 in the voltage range of 0.2–2.2 V (vs. Mg/Mg2+).298

5. Summary and outlook
MOPs (CPs, MOFs, PB and PBAs) are promising alternatives with enhanced energy density and reduced cost to replace conventional intercalated materials. The availability of a wide operating voltage range (0.01–4.5 V) and high specific capacity makes them powerful to compete with commercial electrode materials such as lithium iron phosphate (3.4 V, 170 mA h g−1) and lithium cobalt oxide (4 V, 140 mA h g−1).291 In this review, we have discussed the types of redox reactions and electrochemical mechanisms of MOPs during the ion insertion/extraction: (1) insertion-type MOPs with redox-active bridging linkers or both redox-active metal ions and ligands are recommended to be electrodes with the best performance, and (2) the novel “bipolar charging” principle could be beneficial for further study of varied-size cation/anion intercalation. Moreover, feasible strategies including (1) chemical modification toward both inorganic metal nodes and organic linkers, (2) careful refinement of high working potential cathode substitutes and preeminent PBA candidates, and (3) morphology tuning have been proposed in this review to design novel MOP-based electrode materials for superior battery performance. The bottleneck of pristine MOPs in EES applications is their insulating properties. Fortunately, the electrical conductivity of MOPs could be improved by employing a 2D π–π stacking nanosheet structure, wherein the delocalized electron cloud could be located at π-conjugated in-plane and interlayers. Therefore, constructing a 2D π–πconjugated inter-layer structure from planar ligands and transition metal ions is a good suggestion to overcome the intrinsic insulation behavior of MOPs. Additionally, MOPs with unique porosity and ordered channel distributions are suitable electrode materials for rechargeable batteries based on a large-sized cation intercalation mechanism. However, to date, there are still many challenges for MOPs. Great efforts should be made in the following directions: (1) simpler and mass-production synthetic routes are required to be proposed for the development of cheap materials; (2) the improved conductivity and structural stability of pristine MOPs must be engineered to achieve excellent rate capability and long-life cyclability; and (3) more EES devices should be fabricated with the use of diverse MOP materials. By reviewing the current state of MOP materials in sustainable EES technology, we believe that more breakthroughs in EES-related applications would be achieved for satisfying the rapidly growing demand for high-performance portable energy storage systems.
