    , Accepted 17th October 2014First published on 17th October 2014AbstractA series of novel panchromatic D–D–π–A porphyrin dyes have been synthesized and applied to dye-sensitized solar cells. Three porphyrin dyes named JP1, JP2 and JP3, and their photophysical and electrochemical properties and photovoltaic performance were investigated and compared with reference dye YD2-O-C8. 2-Hexylthiophene chromophores were introduced to the donor groups, which extended the π-conjugation system effectively, then broadened the range of spectral response and improved the charge separation between the donor and acceptor moieties in the excited state. Moreover, this paper used thiophene-2-carboxylic acid instead of the traditional benzoic acid as an anchor group, which can make the molecules arrange to tilted orientation when adsorbed on the TiO2 surface, and this may effectively suppress the dye aggregation and prevent charge recombination. These dyes were clearly red-shifted when compared with dye YD2-O-C8. Especially for dye JP3, its maximum absorption peak was red shifted 20 nm with respect to dye YD2-O-C8 from 645 to 665 nm, and the molar extinction coefficient (6.2 × 104 M−1 cm−1) of JP3 is double that of YD2-O-C8 (3.1 × 104 M−1 cm−1) at the Q band. Dye JP3 extended the spectral response to 750 nm. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicated that the electronic density of the HOMO was increased by the additional thiophene units in these dyes when compared with YD2-O-C8, and this will improve the conjugation and electron donating ability. The power conversion efficiencies of JP1, JP2 and JP3 are 5.09%, 5.62% and 6.40% respectively under AM 1.5G irradiation, which are 74.5%, 82.3% and 93.7% of the YD2-O-C8 based-device (6.83%) under the same conditions.
1. Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have received widespread attention due to their low costs, ease of fabrication and high power conversion efficiency (PCE).1,2 Since they were reported by Grätzel in 1991,3 DSSCs have made great progress and have been regarded as a promising photovoltaic technology to solve the global energy crisis. Although the power conversion efficiency of ruthenium-based dyes has surpassed 10%, ruthenium complexes are difficult to synthesize and the rare metal ruthenium is very expensive.4–6 Currently, many researchers are devoted to developing new and efficient sensitizers such as porphyrin dyes7,8 or metal-free organic dyes9,10 to substitute ruthenium-based dyes. Generally, most sensitizers are often designed in donor–π–acceptor (D–π–A) architecture,11–13 which is conducive to improving intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) and tailoring bandgap energy. It has been found that donor groups such as triarylamine, carbazole, indoline, phenoxazine and tetrahydroquinoline14–16 in conjunction with different acceptor groups such as ethynylbenzoic acid, phosphoric acid, sulphonic acid and pyridine17,18 can construct low band gap sensitizers for DSSCs. Inspired by this strategy, many new architectures including D–D–π–A, D–A–π–A and D–π–A–π–A19–21 have been explored. A power conversion efficiency of 12.3% has been achieved through co-sensitization by porphyrin dye YD2-O-C8 and organic dye Y123 with cobalt-based redox electrolytes.22 Recently, the Grätzel research group synthesized dye SM315 by introducing benzothiadiazole (BTD) between the porphyrin ring and the acceptor, and a power conversion efficiency of 13% was achieved.23 This indicates that the molecular engineering of panchromatic sensitizers is one of the most direct and effective ways to improve the PCE of DSSCs.24
Porphyrin sensitizers have broad absorption at the Soret (400–450 nm) and Q bands (550–600 nm).25,26 If we further improve their absorption intensity, broaden the range of the spectral response by the use of some chromophores, or introduce long alkyl chains to block the π–π stacking and reduce charge recombination, then the overall performance of the DSSCs will improve substantially. Many researchers often optimize the donor segments by introducing rich electronic chromophores, or extending the length of the π-conjugated segments to improve the light-harvesting performance of the dye molecules.27 In our previous reports,28,29 we have succeeded in introducing suitable heterocyclic groups into triarylamine dyes which effectively extends the scope of spectral absorption. Thiophene units with lone pair electrons can effectively delocalize the positive charges and extend the π-conjugation system, which have been widely applied in organic polymer solar cells.30 In this work, we introduced 2-hexylthiophene to the donor groups and used thiophene-2-carboxylic acid as an anchor group. Introduction of the bulky side chain and thiophene chromophores on the periphery of starburst triphenylamine or diphenylamine is one of the effective strategies to suppress dye aggregation and extend the effective conjugation length. The dye aggregation is also affected by the dye's geometry and the resulting arrangement on the TiO2 surface.31 By the geometry optimization, thiophene-2-carboxylic acid induces tilted oriented dye geometry when it binds to the TiO2 surface for dyes JP1–JP3 compared with dye YD2-O-C8; this will help suppress dye aggregation and prevent the I3− of the electrolyte penetrating into the TiO2 surface. We found that the absorption ranges of JP2 and JP3 were obviously red-shifted and the JP3 based-device showed superior charge transport properties. Scheme 1 shows the chemical structures of YD2-O-C8, JP1, JP2 and JP3. We further characterize the photophysical and electrochemical properties, and photovoltaic performance of the dyes.

Synthesis and characterization of dyes
The synthetic routes of JP1, JP2 and JP3 are depicted in Scheme 2. Compounds 2–5 were synthesized by the Suzuki coupling reaction or Sonogashira coupling reaction, and compound 6 was synthesized according to ref. 22. Compound 7 was obtained by Buchwald–Hartwig coupling of compound 2 and compound 6, compound 8 was obtained by Suzuki coupling of compound 5 and compound 6, and compound 9 was obtained by Sonogashira coupling of compound 4 and compound 6. Finally, Sonogashira coupling of compounds 7–9 and thiophene-2-carboxylic acid gave JP1–JP3.

Fabrication of DSSCs
The working electrode (active area 0.16 cm2) was prepared by screen printing the TiO2 paste on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass plates (15 Ω per square). The TiO2 paste consisted of a 12 μm thick film (particle size, 20 nm; pore size 32 nm). Then the electrode was immersed into 0.2 mM dye (YD2-O-C8, JP1, JP2 and JP3) solution in a mixture of toluene and ethanol (toluene/ethanol = 1/1) for 18 h. The working electrode and the Pt counter electrode were then sealed with a Surlyn film (25 μm) by heating the sandwich-type cell at 110 °C. The electrolyte was introduced through pre-drilled holes in the counter electrode and was driven into the cell via vacuum backfilling; the hole was sealed with a Surlyn film and a thin glass (0.1 mm thickness) cover by heating.32 Al foil was taped at the back side of each counter electrode to reflect unabsorbed light. The electrolyte was composed of 0.6 M 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide (BMII), 30 mM I2, 50 mM LiI, 0.5 M tert-butylpyridine and 0.1 M guanidiniumthiocyanate (GuNCS) in a solvent mixture of acetonitrile and valeronitrile (volume ratio, 85:15).
Characterization of DSSCs
The photocurrent–voltage (I–V) curves of the DSSCs were measured on a Keithley 2400 source meter under standard global AM 1.5G solar irradiation supplied by a xenon light source (Oriel). The incident photo-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the DSSCs were obtained by a DC method. The light source was a 300 W xenon lamp (Oriel 6258) coupled to a flux controller to improve the stability of the irradiance. The single wavelength was selected by using a monochromator (Cornerstone 260 Oriel74125). The light intensity was measured by using a NREL traceable Si detector (Oriel 71030NS) and the short circuit currents of the DSSCs were measured by using an optical power meter (Oriel 70310).
Theoretical calculations
In order to investigate the geometrical configuration and electron distribution of YD2-O-C8, JP1, JP2 and JP3, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed at the DFT-B3LYP/LanL2MB level with the Gaussian 09 suite of programs.
UV-vis spectroscopy, photoluminescence, ATR-FTIR spectra, electrochemical properties and measurement of dye adsorbed amounts
UV-Vis absorption spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-3600 spectrometer. Fluorescence spectra were recorded on a Perkin Elmer LS55 spectrophotometer. ATR-FTIR spectra were recorded on a Vector22 spectrometer. The fluorescence lifetimes of the dyes were measured on a FLS920 spectrometer. Quasi-reversible oxidation and reduction waves were recorded on a Chenhua CHI660D model Electrochemical Workstation (Shanghai). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was carried out using a Chenhua CHI660I model Electrochemical Workstation (Shanghai).
The dye adsorbed amounts on the TiO2 films were measured by using a Shimadzu UV-3600 spectrometer. The sensitized 4 × 4 mm electrodes were immersed into a 0.1 M NaOH solution in a mixed solvent (water/ethanol = 1/1), which resulted in the desorption of each dye.
3. Results and discussion
Absorption and emission spectroscopy
The UV-Vis absorption spectra of YD2-O-C8, JP1, JP2 and JP3 examined in THF are shown in Fig. 1, and the corresponding data are collected in Table 1. The four dyes exhibit typical porphyrin absorption characteristics at the Soret and Q bands. The absorption at 400–700 nm can be attributed to electronic transitions from π–π* and the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT). The maximum absorption peaks of JP1, JP2 and JP3 are, respectively, red-shifted by 5, 5 and 10 nm when compared with dye YD2-O-C8 at the Soret band. Apparently, the 2-hexylthiophene units extend the conjugative delocalization with the diphenylamine or triphenylamine segment. Especially for JP1, it not only has a red shift, but also has a higher molar extinction coefficient (2.89 × 105 M−1 cm−1) when compared with YD2-O-C8 (2.20 × 105 M−1 cm−1) at the Soret band, which is because addition of a benzene ring results in extending the conjugative delocalization. The relatively nonplanar structure of dye JP1 may weaken the intramolecular charge transfer, so it is blue shifted by 10 nm at the Q band compared with YD2-O-C8. The spectral response of JP3 is broader and stronger than the other dyes at the Q band, which is because the rigid CC may extend the π-conjugation system, decrease the HOMO–LUMO gap and improve the charge transfer from the donor to the acceptor. The maximum absorption peak of JP3 is red shifted by 20 nm compared to that of dye YD2-O-C8 from 645 to 665 nm, and the molar extinction coefficient (6.2 × 104 M−1 cm−1) of JP3 is double that of YD2-O-C8 (3.1 × 104 M−1 cm−1) at the Q band. Their major emission bands are 659, 675, 684 and 672 nm for JP1, JP2, JP3 and YD2-O-C8, respectively (Fig. S1, ESI‡). It is similar to the trend of the absorption spectra of the four dyes.

The UV-Vis absorption spectra of these dyes adsorbed onto TiO2 are shown in Fig. 1b. The absorption ranges of the four dyes are all broadened and their maximum absorption peaks are slightly blue shifted after anchoring onto TiO2, and might be due to deprotonation of the carboxylic acid.33 It was also investigated by attenuated total reflectance Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR). In the case of JP3 (Fig. 2), when it is adsorbed on TiO2, the ATR-FTIR spectra show that the carbonyl stretch ν(CO) disappears at 1654 cm−1, with a concomitant increase at 1380 cm−1 which originates from the symmetric carboxylate band ν(COO−). It is characteristic of bidentate binding by both oxygen atoms of the carboxylate functional group to the titania of the substrate. The results indicate that JP3 is adsorbed on the TiO2 surface by dehydration reactions.

Electrochemical studies
Electrochemical properties of these dyes were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (Fig. 3). The optical transition energies (E0–0) were estimated from the absorption onset. The ground state oxidation potentials (Eox) of YD2-O-C8, JP1, JP2 and JP3 are all quasi-reversible, with values of 0.828, 0.955, 0.825 and 0.773 V vs. normal hydrogen electrode (NHE), respectively. The oxidation of JP3 is cathodically shifted by 0.182 V relative to JP1, indicating that elevated energy levels are caused by the extended π-conjugation system. Their Eox values are all more positive than the redox potential of the I−/I3− couple (0.4 V vs. NHE), indicating that the oxidized dye can easily get electrons for effective regeneration. The excited oxidation potentials (E*ox) of the dyes can be calculated by the formula E*ox = Eox − E0–0. The E0–0 values of YD2-O-C8, JP1, JP2 and JP3 are 1.851, 1.759, 1.698 and 1.653 eV, respectively. The excited oxidation potentials (E*ox) of YD2-O-C8, JP1, JP2 and JP3 are −1.023, −0.804, −0.873 and −0.880 V, respectively. They are all more negative than the conduction band of TiO2 (−0.5 V vs. NHE). These suggest that such a condition is required for the effective injection of electrons from the excited dye into the conduction band of TiO2. The fluorescence lifetime of the dye was also investigated (Fig. S2,‡Table 1), and the nanosecond lifetime indicated that the excited dyes have enough time to complete the electron injection process.

Theoretical calculations
The HOMOs and LUMOs of YD2-O-C8, JP1, JP2 and JP3 are shown in Fig. 4. The HOMO of YD2-O-C8 is populated over the diphenylamine and porphyrin rings, whereas the HOMOs of JP1–JP3 mainly are populated over the thiophene units and arylamine units, and partly are populated over the porphyrin rings. It is clear that the thiophene units can make contribution to the HOMOs of the three dyes due to their rich electronic properties. The LUMO is essentially spread over the porphyrin ring and the thiophene-2-carboxylic acid anchor groups. Such a well-separated orbital distribution is in favor of the separation of photoexcitation charge, and this suggests that the photoinduced charge can be efficiently injected from excited dyes to the conduction band of TiO2.22

Photovoltaic performance of DSSCs
DSSC experiments have been performed, the photovoltaic performance parameters are listed in Table 2, and the I–V curves of the DSSCs are shown in Fig. 5. The YD2-O-C8 based-device has the highest power conversion efficiency (η) of 6.83%; the η of JP3 (6.40%) is higher than JP1 (5.09%) and JP2 (5.62%). Their fill factors have no much difference. The open-circuit photovoltage (Voc) of JP3 (0.692 V) is higher than YD2-O-C8 (0.683 V), JP1 (0.664 V) and JP2 (0.655 V), and this is mainly due to its better charge transport properties for an excellent π-conjugation system. By the geometry optimization, as depicted in Fig. 6, the thiophene-2-carboxylic acid acceptor can make the molecules arrange to tilted orientation when adsorbed on the TiO2 surface,34,35 and this may effectively suppress the aggregation of dye molecules and prevent the I3− of the electrolyte penetrating into the TiO2 surface. The dihedral angle between the phenyl ring and the porphyrin macrocycle is 72° for JP1 (Fig. S3‡), which indicates that it has a relatively nonplanar structure that reduces the charge recombination, hence the Voc of JP1 is higher than JP2. The short-circuit density (Jsc) of these DSSCs decreased in the following order: YD2-O-C8 (15.20 mA cm−2) > JP3 (13.67 mA cm−2) > JP2 (12.61 mA cm−2) > JP1 (11.36 mA cm−2); this is consistent with the incident photo-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra (Fig. 5b). The IPCE values of JP3 exceed 60% from 425 to 475 nm and attain 70% at 450 nm at the Soret band. Apparently, the IPCE curve of JP3 is higher and broader than the other three dyes at the Q band, which is attributed to its broader absorption and high molar extinction coefficient in the visible region. The IPCE curves of JP1 and JP2 are lower and narrower than JP3, especially for JP1; its lower Jsc and IPCE reduce the overall performance of DSSCs. The IPCE values of YD2-O-C8 exceed 70% from 417 to 461 nm and attain 80% at 440 nm, so YD2-O-C8 has the highest Jsc. In order to further research the Jsc of the DSSCs, the adsorption amounts of these dyes were also investigated (Table 2). The value of JP1 (3.30 × 10−8 mol cm2) is less than JP2 (6.25 × 10−8 mol cm2), JP3 (4.11 × 10−8 mol cm2) and YD2-O-C8 (4.72 × 10−8 mol cm2) and this may be an important reason for the low Jsc of JP1.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is a useful tool to investigate the interfacial charge transfer processes in DSSCs.36 Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was performed under illumination and in the dark. The Nyquist plots and Bode phase plots are shown in Fig. 7. For the Nyquist plots under illumination,37 two semicircles were observed, the large semicircle corresponds to the charge-transfer resistance (Rct) at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface, and the small semicircle corresponds to the transport resistance at the Pt/electrolyte. The radii of the large semicircle increase in the following order: JP3 < YD2-O-C8 < JP1 < JP2, which indicate that JP3 has the smallest charge-transfer resistance. The result is consistent with the Voc of the DSSCs. A high performance DSSC has lower charge-transfer resistance, which is advantageous to collect electrons and enhance the photocurrent. The smallest Rct of JP3 indicates that the electron collection efficiency is better than the other DSSCs. For the Nyquist plots obtained in the dark (the inset of Fig. 7a), the large semicircle corresponds to the electron recombination at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface. The JP3 based-device has the largest semicircle, suggesting that it has the highest charge recombination resistance, and this is helpful for the suppression of the dark current. Hence, the Voc of JP3 is higher than the other DSSCs; this is consistent with previous reports. The Bode phase plots (Fig. 7b) show the frequency peaks of the charge transfer process at different interfaces.38 The middle frequency is related to the charge recombination rate. The lower frequency corresponded to the larger charge recombination resistance and longer electron lifetime. The middle frequency of the DSSCs follows the order: JP3 < YD2-O-C8 < JP1 < JP2, which is consistent with the Voc of the DSSCs.

4. Conclusions
In conclusion, we have developed a novel approach for introducing 2-hexylthiophene chromophores to porphyrin dyes and using thiophene-2-carboxylic acid instead of the traditional benzoic acid as anchor groups. Introduction of the bulky side chain hexyl and thiophene chromophores on the periphery of starburst triphenylamine or diphenylamine is one of the effective strategies to suppress dye aggregation and extend the effective conjugation length. Thiophene-2-carboxylic acid induces tilted oriented dye geometry when it binds to the TiO2 surface for dyes JP1–JP3, and this will help suppress dye aggregation and prevent the I3− of the electrolyte penetrating into the TiO2 surface. Dye JP3 extends the spectral response to 750 nm and the JP3 based-device has a higher power conversion efficiency (η) of 6.40%, which is slightly lower than that of YD2-O-C8 (6.83%) under the same conditions. The results will provide guidance for the synthesis of high performance dyes to improve the power conversion efficiency of DSSCs.
