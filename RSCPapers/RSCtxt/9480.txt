    , Accepted 23rd December 2020First published on 11th January 2021AbstractA techno-economic model of a solar dry reforming process is used to simulate fifteen case studies in which the reaction is used to produce hydrogen, methanol, and butanal from feedstocks obtained from petrochemical, biogas, landfill gas, flue gas, and direct air capture sources. The goal of this analysis is to provide perspective into the remaining technical challenges associated with the commercial application of a solar-driven dry reforming process, which has great potential to be a building block in the burgeoning global circular economy, as a result of the fact that it consumes two greenhouse gases: carbon dioxide and methane. The average available real-world scale of each feedstock is then used to postulate a minimum catalyst activity that would make the use of these feedstocks competitive with their existing petrochemical alternative. It is found that the majority of the minimum catalyst activities required by each of these applications has been demonstrated in the scientific literature in the past two decades. However, in order for these intrinsic catalytic rates to be practically realisable, significant improvements in photoreactor engineering are required to minimize transport losses and maximize photocatalyst-photon contact.

Broader context
Chemical conversion technologies that consume greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane are gaining increasing attention as their atmospheric concentration continues to rise, and the effects of climate change intensify. Vital to reducing emissions from industrial operations, many of these technologies are still in their infancy, and focused research and development is required to advance them to a point at which they can be commercially deployed. Further, the energy required to drive a chemical reaction involving greenhouse gases can be extremely high due to the stability of these molecules. Using solar energy to offset some of this required energy can reduce the energy required to drive these reactions, making them more economically viable. The solar dry reforming reaction discussed in the present work is one such promising reaction, given its ability to convert two greenhouse gases, that can be sourced from a number of anthropogenic wastes, into a wide range of existing industrial chemicals. This can help to phase out the use of petrochemicals in the industrial supply chain, and drastically reduce the carbon intensity of a wide variety of consumer products.

1 An opportunity to decarbonize the petrochemical supply chain?
The ‘dry’ reforming of methane (CO2 + CH4 ⇌ 2CO + 2H2) has gained newfound attention in the last decade because it consumes both carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) gas, the two most abundant greenhouse gases (GHGs). Dry reforming produces synthesis gas (‘syngas’), a gaseous mixture of hydrogen (H2) and carbon monoxide (CO) that is used widely in the petrochemicals sector as a building block for thousands of industrial chemicals through its use as a hydrogen source, or through the synthesis of methanol and butanal (n-butyraldehyde).1 Given that CO2 and CH4 can be collected from a variety of non-fossil sources including landfills, wastewater treatment plants, or agricultural operations,2 the opportunity to consume these gases and effectively recycle and reuse them in our existing chemical supply chain is very attractive in our ongoing fight against climate change.3
Despite having been first performed a century ago,4 the dry reforming reaction has seen its industrial adoption limited to small-scale CO production due to the high energy demands of the process, pervasive catalyst deactivation on non-noble metal catalysts, and the reaction's predisposition to favour higher conversions at low pressures as a result of Le Chatelier's principle, which in turn limits the volumetric throughput of an industrial process unless vacuum techniques are employed.5
Many new demonstrations make use of heterogeneous photocatalysts in an effort to assuage the issue of energy demand by replacing a portion of the required reactor duty with natural light, in a theoretically more facile system.6 These ‘solar’ dry reforming processes (SDR) provide an inspiring new opportunity to run a promising sustainable chemical process using waste feedstocks and a source of renewable energy. However, an important question arises when reflecting on exciting developments on a technology that is rarely used: What is it good for?
This work aims to answer this question by identifying the most economically viable commercial application for SDR, which in turn provides perspective into the remaining technical challenges associated with advancing its technology readiness level, and therefore the areas of research that can have the highest potential impact towards this end. First, a techno-economic analysis is performed to identify the design factors that the economics of SDR are most sensitive to, in an effort to provide insight into the optimal process design for SDR. Following, fifteen case studies are presented in which an SDR process model is used to simulate the operation of an SDR process using varying feedstocks to produce hydrogen, or syngas for the purpose of downstream methanol and butanal synthesis. Feedstocks of petrochemicals, biogas, landfill gas, post-combustion flue gas, and direct air capture are analysed for their economic viability at different scales, and their existing average real-world scale is used to postulate a minimum catalyst activity that would make these case study examples commercially attractive. In conclusion, these idealized minimum catalyst activities are compared to the SDR demonstrations that are found in the scientific literature. Fig. 1 provides an illustration of the feedstocks and downstream use cases that will be under analysis below.

Combinations of each of these feedstocks and products are analysed to determine the most commercially viable combination, as well as the catalyst activities required to make them a reality. 
It is found that the cost of feedstock gases, the amount of time per day the process is on stream, the rate of syngas production facilitated by the photocatalyst, the lifetime of the catalyst material, the cost of the photocatalyst, and scale of production were found to have a significant influence on the operating costs of syngas production. In contrast, the cost of electricity, the presence of a carbon tax, and the number of hours during which natural sunlight is used to meet the energetic requirements of the reaction were not found to have a significant effect on the cost of syngas production from an SDR process. It is shown that the cost of the feedstock, as well as the average scale at which those feedstocks are generally available provide a trade-off that render the use of different feedstocks economical or uneconomical.
Finally, an overview of existing literature examples from the past two decades is reviewed to demonstrate the vital role of continued SDR photocatalyst development and photoreactor design in the ongoing development of sustainable chemical processes like SDR.
2 Factors affecting the operating cost of a solar dry reforming process
The operating expenses of a commercial SDR process are subject to a number of factors, including but not limited to: (1) scale of production; (2) the amount of time per day the process is on stream; (3) the cost of the feedstock gases; (4) the cost of electricity; (5) the presence of a carbon tax; (6) the number of hours during which natural sunlight is used to meet the energetic requirements of the reaction; (7) the percentage of the reactor duty that is compensated for by natural sunlight; (8) the rate of syngas production facilitated by the photocatalyst; (9) the cost of the photocatalyst; and (10) the lifetime of the catalyst material.
In this section, a sensitivity analysis is conducted using an idealized model of an SDR process. The goal of the sensitivity analysis is to see which of the ten design factors listed above have the most significant impact on the production cost of syngas from a solar dry reforming process, and also to indicate the areas of research that can have the largest impact on advancing a solar dry reforming process towards commercialization.
Detailed below, this exercise found that the cost of feedstock, time on stream per day, catalyst activity, catalyst lifetime, catalyst cost, and scale of operation were found to have a significant influence on the operating costs of syngas production. The cost of electricity, the presence of a carbon tax, and the number of hours during which natural sunlight is used to meet the energetic requirements of the reaction were not found to have a significant effect on the cost of syngas production from an SDR process.
2.1 Description of solar dry reforming process model
The idealized SDR process model used to conduct the sensitivity analysis is based on the process flow diagram shown in Fig. 2, which was adapted from Luyben's previous work on the topic.5 The model represents a study estimate-level technoeconomic assessment of the cost of syngas production, based on the methodology presented by Chris Burk,7 and the guidelines for CO2 utilization technologies put forth by the Global CO2 Initiative.8 Therefore, the analysis is assumed to be accurate to within 30%. Capital cost estimates were determined from reports output by the U.S. Department of Energy,9 as well as extrapolated from the authors' lab-scale photoreactor construction. Physical data about chemical species was obtained from Perry's Chemical Engineers’ Handbook.10

E1, E2, and E3 represent the energy flows into and out of the system, specifically the energy input to heat the gases, to drive the solar dry reforming reaction, and to condense the water in the syngas feed, respectively. Right: Significant factors affecting the operating cost of a solar dry reforming process, and the magnitude of their relative impacts, as determined in the sensitivity analysis. 
The SDR process model used to simulate the cost of syngas production is based on a thermal process that operates at 750 °C, and a pressure of 1 atm. The process is assumed to operate stoichiometrically, with an equimolar feed of CO2 and CH4 and an equimolar product of H2 and CO. Further, auxiliary operating costs such as labor and overhead are dealt with using standard economic metrics as shown in the ESI.† The remaining input factors were varied over a range of values, shown in Table 1. The results were analysed using the statistical software package JMP 14.2.0. The effect of collecting natural solar energy to offset some or all of the energy requirements of the SDR reaction system is expressed in the model as the percentage of the total reactor duty offset as a result of this use of natural sunlight. This allows for the practical quantification of the amount by which operating costs can theoretically be reduced if natural sunlight is used to drive the reaction, without having to disambiguate between the two major nanoscale phenomena that are postulated to take place when a photocatalyst is illuminated with light. One phenomenon, referred to as the ‘photothermal’ effect, results when the incident solar energy heats up the catalyst and/or reaction gas mixture, in which case the input of energy into the reaction system by solar energy is in the form of heat. Alternatively, absorption of incident solar energy into an absorbing material can cause an electron to be promoted from the catalysts' valence band to its conduction band, creating an electron–hole pair that is able to facilitate a so-called ‘photochemical’ reaction with adsorbed reaction species. The distinction between these two phenomenon has been reviewed comprehensively elsewhere.11 In addition, it should be noted that photocatalytic (i.e. photochemical or photothermal) systems are further distinguished from ‘solar thermal’ reaction systems in that they are activated by direct illumination of the catalyst by light, whereas solar thermal systems make use of concentrated solar energy to externally heat more conventional chemical reactors.

Compression and transport costs for both feedstocks and products associated with the logistics of a commercial solar dry reforming are neglected in this analysis. Further, the downstream use of the syngas product may require further compression as conventional chemical processes require pressures upwards of 30 atm, and can result in significant costs.5 Up- and downstream thermal integration is also not taken into account, and represents an engineering pathway through which the idealized technoeconomics presented in this work can be further optimized in real-world implementation.
In addition, the assumption is made that carbon deposition onto the surface of the photocatalyst can be kinetically hindered through the discovery of an appropriate photocatalyst. For example, photocatalysts utilizing CeO2 or platinum group metals have been shown to hinder carbon deposition in SDR reaction systems.12,13
2.2 Results of sensitivity analysis
The magnitude of the sensitivity of the cost of syngas production to each of the design factors listed in Table 1 found to be significant is displayed in Fig. 2. Representative of the magnitude of their relative effects, a negative contrast as shown in Fig. 2 indicates an inverse relationship between that factor and the operating cost of the syngas produced. For example, that a higher amount of time spent on stream per day results in a lower operating cost for the syngas production. In the opposite way, a positive contrast indicates a direct relationship, as demonstrated by the positive contrast for the feedstock cost, indicating a lower feedstock cost leads to a lower operating cost.
The cost of the feedstock was found to have the largest effect on the cost of syngas production. This is an unsurprising result for a commodity chemical production process, whose cost structures are commonly dominated by feedstock costs. This highlights the importance of integrating an SDR process with appropriate sources of CO2 and CH4 in order to maximize the probability that the process will be profitable enough to withstand the boom-and-bust cycles of the commodity chemicals sector.
The factor with the second highest impact on the production cost of syngas was found to be the amount of time per day the process is on stream. This suggests that to minimize the production cost of syngas from an SDR process, the process should be run 24 h d−1. This finding is also typical of commodity chemical production processes.
Further, half of the significant factors affecting the cost of the syngas were found to be related to the catalyst material. The catalyst lifetime, activity, and cost each had a significant effect of similar magnitude on the cost of syngas production. This indicates that the development of suitable photocatalyst materials can be a high-impact research and development contribution to make the dry reforming reaction economically attractive and commercially feasible.
Finally, the scale of the SDR process also has a significant effect on the syngas production cost. While an unsurprising result, this factor's significance can bear disproportionate practical weight given the distributed or small-scale nature of GHG sources like bio- or landfill gas that can make achieving economies of scale logistically challenging. Moreover, the ability to scale photocatalytic reactions in an economical manner depends heavily on the reactor design. The fact that the catalyst requires direct illumination with incident light inherently limits the outer diameter of the reactor, and therefore how much gas can be processed at a time. This presents a limit to the usefulness of a conventional reactor scaling factor, as at a certain scale, the capital expenditures begin to be multiples of a maximum reactor size, as multiple reactor systems will be required to run in parallel to meet a specific capacity.
In contrast, the cost of electricity, the presence of a per-tonne carbon tax rebate, and the use of natural sunlight were not found to have a significant effect on the production cost of the syngas, indicating that the fluctuations in cost caused by changes in these parameters within the ranges indicated in Table 1 are not appreciable.
The finding that the opportunity to offset between 5% and 95% of the energy required to drive the dry reforming reaction for up to 6 hours per day using natural sunlight is insignificant is a very interesting one for the field of photocatalytic dry reforming. A likely reason for this is that the sensitivity analysis found that the time per day in which the process is on-line has the second-highest significance in influencing the production cost of synthesis gas in SDR. As a result, to minimize the production costs, the process should be run for 24 hours per day. As a result, the impact of the use of natural sunlight in a six-hour window within the 24 hour operating period is potentially overshadowed, leading to the result that the use of natural sunlight has an insignificant impact on solar dry reforming systems that are run for 24 hours per day.
It should be noted, however, that the result indicating that the use of natural sunlight is insignificant does not mean that photocatalytic dry reforming is un-economical, or that the use of artificially produced light to drive the photocatalytic reaction is pointless. Rather, it shows only that the use of natural sunlight for up to 6 hours in a 24 hour period has an insignificant effect on the operating costs. Whether the use of light in its entirety has an effect on the process efficiency remains a question. It can be reasoned that using electrically produced light from high efficiency LEDs would have a negligible cost increase due to the electrical use, given the positive economics afforded to running the reactor on stream for 24 h d−1. To minimize emissions from this process, renewable electricity can be used to operate the lamps. Using electrical lamps to drive a photocatalytic reaction can also have potential capital advantages over an analogous electrically-driven thermal dry reforming system that is heated using resistive heating, since wear, maintenance, and capital of high-temperature tolerant materials can be significant. High temperature processes also have higher safety risks than those taking place at lower temperatures.
Finally, the presence of significant higher-order interactions between design factors highlights the major engineering tradeoffs inherent to rendering a chemical process economically attractive in the real world, where an opportunity may arise wherein one design factor's influence on the process economics is so advantageous that the negative influence of other suboptimal design factors can be absorbed. For example, the most significant higher order interaction was the second-order interaction between the cost of the feedstock and the time per day that the process is on-line. Intuitively we can glean this to mean that in a scenario where the feedstock is virtually free, the influence that the time per day that the process remains on-line is reduced, indicating that there may be a scenario where the time per day that the process is on-line can be reduced, while still keeping the operating costs of the process low. These tradeoff scenarios can be used to pinpoint the optimal feedstocks, locations, and integrations for real-world SDR processes. Similar tradeoffs are expressed through the other significant higher-order interactions between the time the process spends on-line per day and the catalyst performance, as well as the tradeoff between the time-on-stream and the scale of the process.
3 Case studies analysing the use of various feedstock sources for a solar dry reforming process
Below, the potential to use five different sources of CO2 and CH4 as feedstock to an SDR process are evaluated within the context of their applicability towards the production of hydrogen, methanol, or butanal, which represent the three largest commercial uses of synthesis gas in the market today. The use of petrochemical, biogas, landfill gas, post-combustion flue gas, and direct air capture sources of feedstock gases are analysed to assess their economic viability at a range of scales (see Fig. 3), using a catalyst activity of 0.1 molsyngas gcat h−1 to compare all cases. Following, the analysis is flipped, and the average real-world size of each of these feedstock sources is taken into account to postulate a minimum catalyst activity that would make a solar dry reforming process competitive with its current petrochemical alternative. These results are shown in Fig. 4 and 5.

The SDR process model described in Section 2.1 is used below to simulate a process that operates for 24 h d−1, with the assumption that photocatalytic dry reforming will be accomplished using high-efficiency LED lamps. The cost and lifetime of the hypothetical photocatalyst is based on conventional nickel-alumina catalysts used in steam methane reforming, which cost roughly $33 kg−1 and have a lifetime on average of 3 years.14,15 An electricity cost of $0.10 kW h−1 is assumed, and the presence of a carbon tax is neglected. The activity of the hypothetical catalyst was then varied so as to minimize the syngas production cost for that particular use case.
Hydrogen is produced commercially at scales ranging from 100 to 10000 kgH2 h−1 by using vacuum pressure swing adsorption (VPSA) to extract it from synthesis gas.16 A VPSA unit that produces 100 kgH2 d−1 pulls between 10 and 35 kW of power, depending on the composition of the syngas entering the unit,17 resulting in an annual operating cost of $8700 to 30000, or $0.24 to 0.82 kgH2−1 at an electricity cost of $0.10 kW h−1. For the case study presented below, a cost of $0.82 kgH2−1 will be used, due to the smaller scales and low H2 to CO ratio, which will likely require a higher number of adsorption stages to separate. Further, an H2 recovery rate of 80% across the VPSA is assumed. The CO2 captured assumes that the CO2 separated from the syngas in the H2 purification step is captured and stored as a by-product. 77% of the existing global industrial hydrogen capacity is produced using the steam methane reforming reaction, at a cost of roughly $1.00 kg−1 after purification,18,19 and will be used below as the commercial target price.
Methanol (MeOH) is used in 30% of global industrial chemicals manufacturing processes, including in the production of olefins, formaldehyde, and acetic acid.20 75% of the 110 MtMeOH y−1 produced globally is made from syngas, the composition of which is generally 2:1 H2 to CO.21,22 Thermodynamic modelling of the dry reforming reaction system showed that using a feedstock of 0.2 molCO2 molCH4−1 produces a synthesis gas with an equilibrium composition of 11.4 mol% CO2, 62.4 mol% H2, and 25.6 mol% graphitic carbon (Cgr). For the present analysis of syngas production via SDR for downstream methanol synthesis, a stoichiometric amount of O2 is added to the feed to oxidize the Cgr in a bi-reforming system, at a cost of $40tO2−1.23 Commercial methanol processes produce 2500 to 10000tMeOH d−1 at $150 Mt−1, leading to a target syngas production cost of $0.05 kg−1, which will be used in the below analysis.24,25
Butanal, or n-butyraldehyde, is produced via the hydroformylation reaction (also known as the Roelen, hydrocarbonylation, oxonation, or the ‘oxo-’ reaction), in which a homogeneous metal–organic catalyst is used to add CO and H2 in synthesis gas to the double bond of an olefin, usually ethylene or propylene.26 While not a household chemical name, butanal is a foundational ingredient in the production of polyvinyl chloride, and is produced on a massive scale, with some 12 Mt produced each year.27,28 Butanal is also used to produce butanol in increasingly higher quantities with the demand for phthalate-free plastics on the rise.29 Synthesis gas having a equimolar ratio of H2 to CO is required in the hydroformylation reaction, making it an ideal candidate to use syngas produced by an SDR process.27 Butanal sells for a commodity price of amount $110 Mt−1, with typical plants producing between 0.6 to 3 Mt y−1. The cost of syngas and propylene account for 80% of the total production cost of butanal, with propylene taking the lion's share of these costs (64%), while the balance 16% of the feedstock cost is allocated to the synthesis gas.28 Using a commodity price of propylene of roughly $0.68 kg−1,30 a target of $0.09 kgsyngas−1 is used to assess competitiveness of the each case study scenario below.
3.1 Use of petrochemical feedstocks to produce hydrogen, methanol, or butanal via solar dry reforming
The base case considered is the use of a conventional petrochemically-sourced feedstock comprised of natural gas as a methane source at $0.01 kg−1, combined with carbon dioxide that is assumed to be obtained for free as a waste gas.
Subfigures A to C in Fig. 4 show that H2 production costs fall below the target cost of $1.00 kgH2−1 above production scales of 100 kgH2 h−1. For a representative petrochemical-scale production capacity of 5000 kgH2 h−1, a minimum catalyst activity of 6.7 × 10−3 molH2 gcat−1 h−1 is required in order to achieve an H2 cost of $1.00 kgH2, shown in Fig. 4D.
Methanol production costs fall below the commercial target when using petrochemical feedstocks for production capacities above 10000 kgMeOH d−1. To produce methanol at an average commercial capacity of 3750000 kgMeOH d−1, the process will require a syngas production rate of 37.1 tsyngas h−1. A minimum syngas cost of $0.15 kgsyngas−1 is achievable for catalyst activities above 1.3 × 10−2 molsyngas gcat−1 h−1. Due to the electricity requirements and feedstock cost, a cost below $0.15 kgsyngas−1 is unachievable.
A petrochemical scale hydroformylation process producing 0.82 Mtbutanal y−1 requires a syngas feed of roughly 76 tsyngas h−1. To achieve this production rate with a target syngas production cost of $0.09 kg−1, a minimum catalyst activity of 2.1 × 10−3 molsyngas gcat−1 h−1 is required.
3.2 Use of biogas feedstock produced via anaerobic digestion of manure to produce hydrogen, methanol, or butanal via solar dry reforming
‘Biogas’ refers to a gaseous mixture of CO2 and CH4 that originates from the anaerobic digestion of organic matter, which can be sourced from agricultural wastes (e.g. manures or crop residues), municipal solid wastes (sludge from wastewater treatment or waste collection), landfill waste, or energy crops cultivated specifically for the purpose of biogas production.31 Typical raw biogas composition in the exit stream of an anaerobic digester ranges from 40–70% CH4, 15–60% CO2, 5–10% H2O, and trace amounts of other components such as H2S, VOCs, ammonia, or CO.32 The process of anaerobic digestion, along with the subsequent removal of water and sulphur impurities from the resulting biogas has been estimated to cost roughly $0.82 kg−1.33 These systems are currently used in either combined heat-and-power systems, or upgraded to “renewable natural gas” standards and injected into natural gas distribution systems in favourable jurisdictions.
Subfigures A–C in Fig. 4 show that using biogas is the feedstock option that results in the highest production cost for syngas that will produce hydrogen, methanol, and butanal production. This is a direct result of the high costs of biogas as a feedstock to the SDR, and result in an inability of biogas-sourced feedstocks to compete with the petrochemical alternative.
Using the example of biogas generated from cattle manure, a minimum catalyst activity is postulated below that will minimize the cost of the downstream product. Biogas yield from the anaerobic digestion of cattle manure is 894 to 1344 kg head−1 y−1.31 The size of the average commercial US cattle farm has ballooned in the last decade to 120000 head of cattle,34 indicating the potential to produce 107000 tbiogas y−1 production, or 12 t h−1. The low-grade biogas produced from this system is assumed to have a composition of 60% CH4 and 40% CO2 by mass.
In this system, it is infeasible to produce H2 at a cost below $1.73 kg−1, regardless of the catalyst activity, due to the feedstock, smaller average scale, and electricity costs for the process. To achieve this minimum cost, a minimum catalyst activity of 7.9 × 10−4 molH2 gcat−1 h−1 is required.
To produce MeOH from the same biogas feed, a minimum syngas cost of $0.99 kg−1 can be achieved for catalyst activities above syngas production rates of 7.0 × 10−3 molsyngas gcat−1 h−1.
Similarly, a solar dry reforming system coupled to a hydroformylation process would produce 0.13 Mtbutanal year−1. Due to the high cost of biogas production from anaerobic digestion systems, the minimum syngas cost that can be achieved is $0.89 kg−1 syngas above catalyst activities of 1.0 × 10−2 molsyngas gcat−1 h−1.
3.3 Use of landfill gas to produce hydrogen, methanol, or butanal via SDR
Similar to biogas, landfill gas is produced via the anaerobic digestion of organic matter. The main difference is that landfill gas is naturally occurring in the subterranean anaerobic environment of a covered landfill, and requires capture systems to collect and remove water from the gas at a cost of roughly $0.02 kgLFG−1 captured once installed.35 Landfill gas composition is roughly 50% CH4, and 50% CO2.
In the United States, 136 Mt y−1 of municipal solid waste (MSW) are diverted to some 1269 landfills, amounting to an average of 0.11 Mt y−1 per landfill. Landfill gas yield from municipal solid waste (MSW) is roughly 700 kg h−1 Mt−1 of MSW in the landfill.36 Using these figures, the case studies presented below will be based on an available source of landfill gas of 77 kgLFG h−1 production.
Similar to the biogas case, the minimum cost of H2 production from landfill gas is $1.62 kgH2−1, for all catalyst activities above 0.03 molH2 gcat−1 h−1. This is due in part to the reduced scale of landfill gas production but is compensated for by the cheaper feedstock cost afforded through the use of landfill gas over anaerobic digestion of cattle manure, resulting in a unit cost of H2 slightly lower than that of biogas.
Landfill gas produces syngas for methanol production at a slightly lower cost than biogas, at $0.89 kg−1, for syngas production rates above 7.0 × 10−3 molsyngas gcat−1 h−1. As above, the advantages of the low cost of landfill gas capture are tempered by the low volumes produced at site.
For butanal production, the minimum syngas cost achievable is $0.78 kg−1 at catalyst activities above 9.0 × 10−3 molsyngas gcat−1 h−1. A hydroformylation process of this size would produce 830 tbutanal y−1.
3.4 Use of carbon dioxide captured from post-combustion flue gas to produce hydrogen, methanol, or butanal via SDR
CO2 emitted from post-combustion flue gas can be combined with natural gas to provide a feedstock for the SDR process. Capturing CO2 from flue gas is challenging due to the low concentrations of CO2 in the stream, which have a typical composition of 15–16% CO2, 5–7% H2O, 70–75% N2, and a balance of various NOx, SOx, and H2S impurities.37 Natural gas power plants emit between 0.4 to 0.8 kgCO2 kW h−1 of electricity produced.38 Chemical absorption via aqueous amine scrubbing is the most developed technology for this purpose and has been applied commercially.39,40 Recently enzyme-based aqueous scrubbing columns have been developed and demonstrated industrially, as well as other newer technologies like polymeric membranes have been introduced by large gas producers like Air Liquide.41,42 Current cost projections for amine-based CO2 scrubbing systems are roughly $40–70 tCO2−1, with the US DOE aiming to reduce this to $10 tCO2−1 by 2035.43 For the present analysis, an intermediate value of $0.05 kg−1 will be used, along with the assumption that the power plant emits 0.4 kgCO2 kW h−1 of electricity produced.
The case studies below are based on the US Department of Energy's Petra Nova post-combustion carbon capture facility and describe the use of CO2 captured from the exhaust of an 820 MW natural gas power plant, that emits 344 tCO2 h−1.44,45 To be used as a feedstock for an SDR process, the captured CO2 is combined with a stoichiometric amount of natural gas, included at a cost of $0.01 kg−1.
The above described SDR system can achieve a cost of $1.00 kgH2−1 using a catalyst with an activity of 1.2 × 10−3 molH2 gcat−1 h−1 due to the large scale and low cost of CO2.
With the intention of production methanol, a solar dry reforming system using CO2 from post-combustion flue gas would produce syngas for a minimum of $0.20 kg−1 at a minimum catalyst activity of 7.9 × 10−3 molsyngas gcat−1 h−1.
Syngas with the intention of producing butanal can achieve a cost of $0.09 kg−1 with catalyst activities above 1.4 × 10−2 molsyngas gcat−1 h−1.
3.5 Use of direct air capture systems to produce hydrogen, methanol, or butanal via SDR
Direct air capture technologies are attractive because they actively decrease the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere. Further, if successful at scale, they would provide a centralized, large-scale source of CO2, allowing for a larger scale solar dry reforming system to be used, decreasing the cost of syngas production. Capturing carbon dioxide from air is done using either solid sorbents, alkaline solutions, or a hybrid of the two and has proven challenging due to the highly dilute nature of the CO2 in our atmosphere (418 ppm).40 Recent commercial applications of these technologies have achieved costs of $94 to 232 tCO2−1, and are projected to drop below $60 tCO2−1 by 2040.46,47 For the present analysis, an intermediate value of $150 tCO2−1 is used.
The direct air capture process described by Keith et al. is used as the basis for the case studies below that describe the use of DAC systems as a source of CO2 to an SDR process.47 This installation was reported to be able to capture 1 Mt y−1 or 114 tCO2−1 h−1. This captured CO2 will be combined with natural gas to provide a feedstock to the solar dry reforming process. Similarly to the use of flue gas, the CO2 captured using a DAC system is combined with a stoichiometric amount of natural gas. For hydrogen production, these conditions allow for a minimum cost of $1.04 kgH2−1 to be achieved with a catalyst activity above 1.3 × 10−2 molH2 gcat−1 h−1 for the present DAC system. For syngas production with the intention of MeOH synthesis, a minimum cost of $0.23 kg−1 is found for catalyst activities above 8.8 × 10−3 molsyngas gcat−1 h−1. For butanal production, a minimum syngas product cost of $0.19 kg−1 for catalyst activities above 2.6 × 10−2 molsyngas gcat−1 h−1. This scale of operation would produce roughly 1.55 Mtbutanal y−1.

This article aims to provide some perspective to researchers in the field of photocatalytic dry reforming what potential avenues for commercialization might be using the current conventional petrochemical commodity prices and processes as a benchmark, and by extension highlighting research and development efforts that have the potential for high impact in affecting the commercialization timeline for SDR. In this section, the remaining technical and non-technical challenges associated with commercializing an SDR process are discerned from the above analyses. Alternative low-technology readiness routes for the production of hydrogen, methanol, and butanal are also briefly reviewed.
4.1 Remaining technical challenges in commercializing SDR

Fig. 5 shows the minimum production rates that are required from a dry reforming photoreactor to minimize the operating cost for each of the fifteen case studies presented in Section 3. Overlayed on this figure are the photocatalyst activities reported in the academic literature over the past two decades.
The results indicate that for several applications, the minimum catalyst activity required to minimize production costs in the process at hand have already been out-performed by several orders of magnitude by catalysts presented in the literature, with the exception of hydrogen production using a direct air capture system, and may be commercially promising if their lifetimes can be extended to compete with existing industrial nickel-alumina catalysts used in steam methane reforming, which last on average between 1 to 5 years. Details of the literature examples used are shown in Table 2.

While the intrinsic catalyst rates reported in the scientific literature may appear to be high enough to warrant commercial application, it is up to the photoreactor design to create favorable mass and energy transport conditions in the reactor system so that the reported catalyst rates are practically realisable in a scaled system. There are several challenges associated with photoreactor design. One challenge is designing the substrate upon which the catalyst sits, which should have the goal of providing the highest percent of the photocatalyst surface that can be illuminated with light. These architectures may or may not provide the shortest path length depending on their architecture. A second challenge is optimizing the catalyst coating thickness onto the substrate architecture so as to match the coating thickness with the photon penetration depth of the catalyst so as to not waste catalyst material. A third challenge is to design catalyst coating and substrate topologies that minimize reflectance and maximize photon absorption. A fourth challenge is maximizing the catalyst mass present in the reactor with regards to the optimal coating thickness, so as to maximize the conversion of the feed gases, while simultaneously not occupying too much land area. These trade-offs are inescapable realities of real-world photoreactor implementation and are topics ripe for academic engineering research.
Further, the reactor system in the present techno-economic model makes use of a conventional scaling factor for chemical reactors. However, the fact that the catalyst requires direct illumination with incident light inherently limits the outer diameter of the reactor, and therefore how much gas can be processed at a time. This presents a limit to the usefulness of a conventional reactor scaling factor, as at a certain scale, the capital expenditures begin to be multiples of a maximum reactor size, as multiple reactor systems will be required to run in parallel to meet a specific capacity. This remains to be demonstrated at scale.
4.2 Non-technical challenges associated with the commercial adoption of SDR
It is important to note that it is not only the technical performance of SDR that renders the process economical. Rather, ‘economic viability’ depends on a number of non-technical factors including consumer behaviours, public policy, supply chain partnerships, and labor force optimization.
An economic incentive like a carbon tax could render these technologies economically attractive at the smaller scales required to facilitate their technological development and advancement to the scales required to meet global demand. Significant research into syngas upgrading reactions, as well as in technologies for the transport of gases, and feedstock preparation are also vital to the commercial realization of a solar dry reforming system.
Another challenge in collecting GHGs for recycling is their largely distributed nature, which makes transport costs high if a large-scale, centralized dry reforming facility is required to take advantage of the economy of scale afforded to building a large plant. Anaerobic digestion for biogas production may be able to fit a large-scale model if organic matter can be transported to a large, centralized plant as solids are more economically transported than gases. Landfill gas, flue gas, and fugitive natural gas are more distributed in nature and therefore will be more difficult to collect at large scales. As a result, co-location of several supply chain steps can be a crucial key to the success of not only SDR, but many burgeoning carbon capture and utilization technologies. For example, having an SDR reactor co-located with a hydrogen fuelling station and farm can provide the conditions necessary for favourable project economics and minimization of transport and labor costs.
4.3 Alternative pathways for the production of low-carbon hydrogen, methanol, and butanal
Finally, it is worth nothing that alternative routes to the production of low-carbon hydrogen, methanol, and butanal exist both commercially and in the academic literature. These technologies are summarized and commented on briefly below.

4.3.1 Alternative routes for low-carbon hydrogen. 
Hydrogen can be produced ‘sustainably’ through a number of pathways. Conventional steam methane reforming processes can be fitted with carbon dioxide capture systems to reduce emissions, although conventional feedstocks of fossil-derived methane gas or coal can increase the carbon intensity of the end product. Further, the issue of what to do with the carbon dioxide gas once it has been captured from the system is up for question.
Water electrolysis,48 which uses an electric current to evolve hydrogen gas from water, is the only commercially available alternative to reforming technologies that promises a low-carbon intensity product. Water electrolysis, however, requires significant electricity input, and requires a source of water to operate, restricting the jurisdictions in which it may be applicable. In addition, replacing fossil fuels with water, a precious resource vital to human life, as the building block for our entire petrochemical supply chain raises additional resource management questions.
In addition to the commercial electrolyzer systems, several low-technology readiness pathways for the production of low-carbon hydrogen using biological, photochemical, and photoelectrochemical technologies have been presented in the academic literature.
Biological H2 production (i.e. ‘biohydrogen’) using photosynthetic algae is an attractive technology for green hydrogen production since it uses only water and sunlight as feedstocks to the reaction, and avoids the use of metal or metal–oxide catalysts. Hans Gaffron first introduced the idea of biological hydrogen production in 1939 by discovering that the green algae Scenedesmus obliquus can evolve H2 in the presence of light under anaerobic conditions, which provided an environment that disrupted the oxygen metabolism often associated with plant photosynthesis, and caused the algae instead to evolve H2 by favouring activity in the identified hydrogenase enzyme.49 Since that time, several other species of algae and cyanobacteria have been demonstrated to be active for biohydrogen production. Challenges remaining in the commercializability of biohydrogen technologies are centred around algal farming techniques and bioreactor design. Algal farming, like other energy crops, takes agricultural land away from food production, and therefore its priority as a commercial crop may be limited from a food security perspective. Bioreactor challenges are associated with optimizing transport phenomena within the reactor so as to maximize contact between the algae, water medium, and light.50 Further, selectivity of the reaction needs to be improved as the production of carbon dioxide within the bioreactor can inhibit the metabolic pathways associated with hydrogen production.
Photochemical and photoelectrochemical water splitting systems were first demonstrated in the 1970s, and have since received extensive research attention due to the promise of direct solar-to-hydrogen energy conversion and the possibility to use hydrogen as a carrier material for solar energy. In photochemical systems, a semiconductor photocatalyst with a suitable bandgap and relative band edge positions produce photo-generated electrons when illuminated with light which reduce the water molecules present and evolve hydrogen gas. In a similar fashion to electrocatalytic water splitting, technical challenges are associated with the dependence on noble metal catalysts, electrode stability, and over potentials required to drive the reaction. Photoelectrochemical systems offer a hybrid approach between photochemistry and electrochemistry. Photoelectrochemical systems can appear using two schemes. In one approach, a solar photovoltaic panel can be used to harvest solar energy, and convert it into electricity that can be used to power a conventional electrolyzer. In another scheme, direct semiconductor–liquid contact can be taken advantage of wherein the electrodes of an electrochemical device are made up of light-harvesting materials and are aptly termed photoelectrodes. These systems have been of great research interest in sustainable fuels production over the past fifty years and have been extensively reviewed elsewhere.50,51


4.3.2 Alternative routes for low-carbon methanol. 
Low-carbon methanol production has been the subject of extensive research and development for many decades due to its wide application in the production of commodity chemicals ranging from small building blocks like olefins and acetic acid to consumer products like resins, adhesives, and paints. As such, a number of approaches to low-carbon methanol have appeared in industrial practice and in the academic literature, which have been extensively reviewed by our group previously.22 Below, we briefly provide an overview of the thermochemical, biochemical, and photochemical advances in methanol production.
As described in Section 3, 98% of methanol is produced from fossil-derived synthesis gas in thermal processes that operate at temperatures in the range of 300 °C and pressures of 5–10 MPa. Recently, there has been focus on replacing the fossil-derived feedstocks to this process with CO2 and H2O, in a scheme to use waste CO2 to produce methanol—an idea that has been borne out in reality at George Olah's Carbon Recycling International methanol plant in Iceland. The CRI plans produces 4000 MTMeOH per year from CO2 and H2 derived from water electrolysis.22
Biological routes to methanol production are split into two categories: first, methanol can be produced in the conventional thermochemical route using organic-matter derived biogas via anaerobic digestion to provide the methane feedstock from a renewable source. Alternatively, direct biosynthetic routes have been demonstrated using methylosinus trichosporium IMV 3011 was used to convert CO2 and CH4 into methanol.52 Several other strategies using different varieties of methanotrophic bacteria are also present in the literature and have been reviewed elsewhere.53
Photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical routes to methanol production have also been demonstrated. Photocatalytic hydrogenation of CO2 and H2 at ambient pressure has been shown to produce methanol with 50% selectivity over CO, and has previously been shown to be produced alongside hydrogen and acetic acid in photoelectrochemical systems using a feedstock of CH4 and water.54 However, the efficiencies of these systems, as well as catalyst and electrode stability are areas of improvement required to increase the technology readiness of direct methanol photocatalytic and photochemical production schemes.


4.3.3 Alternative routes for low-carbon butanal. 
As described in Section 3, butanal is almost exclusively synthesized via the hydroformylation of propylene with syngas. In addition to the low-carbon route to butanal using SDR-derived syngas, few examples of alternative routes to butanal production have been demonstrated. A direct biosynthetic route to the production of butanal from biomass-derived glucose was demonstrated using an engineered escherichia coli organism.55 However, competing side reactions that produce butanol are persistent. Another biosynthetic strategy makes use of the E. coli and streptomyces strains.56 A patent has also been filed on a method of producing butanal from recombinant solventogenic bacteria and recombinant microorganisms by the Eastman Renewable Materials company. No photocatalytic routes for direct CO2-to-butanal production have been reported, although the photocatalytic degradation of butanal has been investigated.57

5 Conclusions
In this investigation we have shown that the industrial realization of a dry reforming process relies heavily on the cost of the feedstock, which in turn determines the end product that can be manufactured downstream of the solar dry reforming process. From a technological development perspective, catalyst material development to improve a catalyst is a major driver in the success of the technology. Intrinsic catalyst activities should be boosted to account for any transport losses that result from implementation in a scaled reactor. In coordination, photoreactor design to minimize these transport losses is essential in the successful commercial implementation of SDR.
The techno-economic analysis determined that the use of petrochemical feedstocks provides the most flexbility in the use of SDR to produce hydrogen, methanol, or butanal, as the feedstock gases and the large scales available make potential SDR implementation cost-efficient. The use of biogas as a feedstock for SDR can be prohibitive due to the high costs of maintaining an anaerobic digester, but may be suitable for hydrogen production in scenarios where the sale price of hydrogen is high, for example in direct-to-consumer sales of hydrogen for hydrogen-powered vehicles. Landfill gas is a good rival for petrochemical feedstocks, due to its low cost of collection. However, unless large, centralized landfills can be organized to take advantage of larger scale production, landfill gas may be too distributed of a resource to be a cost-effective feedstock for SDR as a result of the small scale. Using CO2 captured from post-combustion flue gas in combination with natural gas can be attractive for hydrogen and butanal production, at scales above 10000 kgbutanal h−1. The Petra Nova natural gas power plant provides CO2 on a scale able to produce butanal at scales several orders of magnitude greater than this. Using CO2 from direct air capture systems can be advantageous for hydrogen production at scales above 100 kgH2 h−1, but its high cost makes it prohibitive for methanol or butanal synthesis.
Finally, research into synergistic feedstock capture, and downstream syngas conversion technologies will make SDR a commercial reality and contribute to the emergent circular economy.

Broader context
Chemical conversion technologies that consume greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane are gaining increasing attention as their atmospheric concentration continues to rise, and the effects of climate change intensify. Vital to reducing emissions from industrial operations, many of these technologies are still in their infancy, and focused research and development is required to advance them to a point at which they can be commercially deployed. Further, the energy required to drive a chemical reaction involving greenhouse gases can be extremely high due to the stability of these molecules. Using solar energy to offset some of this required energy can reduce the energy required to drive these reactions, making them more economically viable. The solar dry reforming reaction discussed in the present work is one such promising reaction, given its ability to convert two greenhouse gases, that can be sourced from a number of anthropogenic wastes, into a wide range of existing industrial chemicals. This can help to phase out the use of petrochemicals in the industrial supply chain, and drastically reduce the carbon intensity of a wide variety of consumer products.


 	Fig. 1  An illustration of the potential feedstock sources and downstream products that can be made into and from synthesis gas produced via solar dry reforming. Combinations of each of these feedstocks and products are analysed to determine the most commercially viable combination, as well as the catalyst activities required to make them a reality.	 

 	Fig. 2  Left: Process flow diagram of the solar dry reforming process used in this analysis, and adapted from Luyben's previous work on the topic.5 S1, S2, S3, S4, and S5 represent the material streams that transport the cool feed gases, heated feed gases, wet syngas product, dry syngas product, and water, respectively. E1, E2, and E3 represent the energy flows into and out of the system, specifically the energy input to heat the gases, to drive the solar dry reforming reaction, and to condense the water in the syngas feed, respectively. Right: Significant factors affecting the operating cost of a solar dry reforming process, and the magnitude of their relative impacts, as determined in the sensitivity analysis.
