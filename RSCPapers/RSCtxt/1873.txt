    , Accepted 24th April 2020First published on 24th April 2020AbstractHeat-localized evaporation has been perceived as a potential strategy for water purification. However, the evaporators reported usually suffer from poor performances under low solar irradiation which is nevertheless very common in daily life, and the study on the interfacial thermodynamics still needs further exploration. By imitating the structure of natural leaves, we fabricate a foldable carbon-dot-based evaporator which achieves an excellent vapor generation performance of 1.58 kg m−2 h−1 under 0.5 sun irradiation, significantly higher than those of other evaporators reported previously. Moreover, its performance could be further enhanced up to 2.18 kg m−2 h−1 by being fabricated into a 3D structure, which can be possibly attributed to an extra environmental heat input because of its relatively low interfacial temperature according to our theoretical model. In addition, the large-scale production of the evaporator is greatly facile in terms of raw materials and the fabrication procedure. Finally, this energy from weak solar irradiation and environmental heat could also be efficiently converted into gravitational potential by integrating our steam generator with a forward osmosis system to drive water vertical transportation, promising for the full utilization of low-grade energy.
1. Introduction
Solar-driven interfacial steam evaporation, a photo-thermal conversion technique without relying upon an additional energy input, has attracted enormous research interest in water purification1,2 and energy storage,3,4 where solar-thermal energy conversion is localized to an air–liquid interface to minimize the unnecessary thermal losses compared with conventional bulk heating-based evaporation.5–8 A highly efficient evaporator should possess several features, including superior absorptivity across the entire solar spectrum range, thermal insulation to restrict heat conduction to bulk water, and appropriate wettability and pore structures for water transport as well as vapor escape.9–11 So far, high solar-to-vapor energy conversion efficiencies (e.g. 90%) have been demonstrated.12–15 However, the evaporators reported previously usually suffered from low performances especially under low solar irradiation that is very common in daily life such as in the morning, and deep fundamental research is still needed to understand the thermodynamics behind it.16,17 Also, considering the large energy consumption during the evaporation (2441.7 kJ kg−1), it is essential to integrate interfacial evaporation systems into energy harvesting technologies, which will probably help address the utilization of low-grade thermal energy and radiation intermittency issues.18
In nature, the transpiration process by biological systems could provide ample inspiration for the design of energy storage together with efficient steam evaporation systems (Fig. 1a). For example, plants, such as trees, can take up water from roots, and then transport them upward through xylem to leaves, which are as high as several decametres (e.g. General Sherman tree in Sequoia National Park, 83.8 m in height). In this case, water chemical potential gradient derived from transpiration is responsible for driving force against gravity.19–21 In addition, for the transpiration process, water escapes from mesophyll cells to leaf airspace through tremendous cell walls as air–water interfaces, where significant heat from the surrounding environment is adsorbed as the additional energy input besides solar energy.22
 Fig. 1  Illustrative schematics of steam generation and energy harvesting. (a) The partial structure of a leaf and its transpiration behavior. (b) Schematic of the environmental energy-enhanced solar steam generation. The liquid–air interfaces wrapped around the microgels, facilitating water evaporation. The absorber (rCDs) was embedded in the polymeric PVA microgel skeleton. 
Herein, we show a tree-inspired microgel system for efficient steam generation and simultaneous energy harvesting from low-grade environmental heat and low solar irradiation (Fig. 1b). An efficient evaporator was fabricated by embedding reduced carbon dots (rCDs) into polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) microgels (PVA–rCDs). The carbon dots (CDs) have ultrafine sizes (around 5 nm), excellent solubility and high light absorbance ability, beneficial for the preparation of homogeneous composite microgels with excellent photothermal performance.23–25 In terms of evaporation kinetics, the PVA-CD microgels have several unique advantages: (i) harvesting thermal energy from the environment as an additional energy input through the substantial amounts of liquid–gas interfaces to enhance the evaporation rate per apparent area, similar to the transpiration process of trees; (ii) enhancing light absorption by rough interfaces with well-distributed rCDs; (iii) suppressing heat loss to underlying water because of the limited thermal convection among the semi-separated interspaces surrounded by the microgels. Owing to these advantages, the PVA–rCD microgel evaporator therefore showed an excellent evaporation rate as high as 1.58 kg m−2 h−1 under 0.5 sun illumination, and its performance was further enhanced up to 2.18 kg m−2 h−1 by being fabricated into a 3D structure. In addition, the large-scale production of the evaporator is greatly facile in terms of raw materials and the fabrication procedure.
By integrating the heat-localized steam generation system with the osmosis process, we present a design of an artificial tree to duplicate the transpiration and water transport behavior outside a real tree, and our system consists of three parts: (i) a heat-localized water evaporator analogous to the leaf section which provides freshwater through a distillation device during the daytime; (ii) a forward osmosis (FO) membrane employed as the root section to draw pure water from a dilute solution to a concentrated solution;26,27 and (iii) a long vertical tube as xylem through which water can transport upward. Under the synergic effect between evaporation-derived concentration and osmosis-derived dilution, desalinated water could be continuously obtained at the top of the devices with a height of minimum 3 m (as an example in here, the theoretical prediction value is as high as 2.22 km), promising in the applications of efficient water desalination during the daytime together with solar energy storage in the form of gravitational potential energy for hydroelectric generation at night.
2. Results and discussion
2.1. Synthesis and chemical structures of PVA–rCD microgels
Pristine CDs were synthesized through electrooxidizing graphite,28 which showed a clear lattice fringes of 0.21 nm in high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images, corresponding to the (100) interlayer spacing of graphitic carbon (Fig. 2a). CDs with varying oxidative degrees were then obtained by hydrazine treatment for different time periods to reveal their possible impact on solar-induced evaporation performance through light absorbance, heat localization and wettability in the following (Fig. 2b). When subjected to thermal reduction treatment, the CD solution turned from black brown to black color, revealing the partial removal of oxygen containing groups and thus an expanded π-conjugated domain in the reduced CDs (rCDs) (Fig. S1 and S2†). The Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra (Fig. S3†) indicated a much weaker epoxy group peak (1136 cm−1) after hydrazine treatment, in agreement with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results (Table S1, Fig. S4†), which showed a significant increase of the C/O atomic ratio (from 2.09 to 3.44) and a much weaker C–O/CO peak from 0.70 to 0.42 after a reaction for 15 h (normalized with C–C/CC peak intensity).

(f) HRTEM image of rCDs embedded in the PVA matrix. (g) FTIR spectra of CDs, rCDs, PVA microgels and PVA–rCD microgels. (h and i) SEM images of PVA–rCD microgels wrapped with CMC at different magnifications (inset shows the photograph of an as-prepared PCM loaded on cellulose paper). 
PVA microgels were prepared through a reverse suspension cross-linking method by employing paraffin as the oil phase and sorbitan monooleate as the emulsifier,29 which showed a well-defined spherical-like shape with a tunable average diameter from 130 nm to 26.7 μm by controlling the stirring rate during the reaction (Fig. S5†). Compared to PVA microspheres, PVA–rCD microgels (PCM) synthesized through adding rCDs into reaction solution showed similar micro-morphologies and sizes (Fig. 2c and d). Importantly, the rCDs were monodispersed in the PVA microgel matrix, as revealed from the dark domain of 5 nm with clearly resolved lattice spacings of 0.21 nm in HRTEM images (Fig. 2e and f). The incorporation of rCDs into the PVA network was also further confirmed by the intensified peak of 1634 cm−1 in the FTIR spectra, which was ascribed to the CO groups of rCDs (Fig. 2g).25 Finally, PCM was loaded onto cellulose paper after blending carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) as the binder (Fig. 2h and i). In addition, for contrast experiments, PVA–rCD monolithic hydrogel (PCB) counterparts were also prepared following a similar synthetic procedure to that of synthesizing microgels without adding an oil phase and emulsifier (Fig. S6†).
2.2. Photothermal properties and vapor generation performance
The samples of rCDs, PVA and PVA–rCDs show a good stability and the weight loss over the temperature range of 30–120 °C, which was ascribe to the removal of the physisorbed water (Fig. S7†). The photothermal conversion abilities of PCM and PCB were first studied because of their strong impact on the steam generation rate according to previous literatures.12,13 First, under constant solar illumination (1 kW m−2), the dehydrated PCM aerogel was heated remarkably to an equilibrium temperature of around 59 °C within 500 s, significantly higher than that of the PVA–rCD bulk aerogel (54 °C). This result suggests the more prominent heat confinement effect of PCM. Second, the in situ temperature changes of PCM and PCB were also recorded when they were being employed as solar-driven interfacial evaporators. In this case, PCM and PCB have much lower equilibrium temperature (∼37 and ∼35 °C) than those recorded for the dried gels. In comparative experiments without the evaporator, the temperature of water slowly rose from 23 °C to only 25 °C under similar working conditions (Fig. 3a and b).

(a) The surface temperature changes of PCB and PCM in their dry and wet states, as well as bulk water at a solar power density of 1 kW m−2 as a function of irradiation time. (b) Infrared images of PCM with the light irradiation time of 0 min, 10 min, and 60 min under one sun (temperature unit: °C). (c) The weight changes over time for bulk water, PCB and PCM, and the corresponding PVA counterparts under 1 kW m−2 irradiation. (d) The weight changes over time for PCM under 0.2 to 4 sun (0.2 to 4 kW m−2) irradiation. (e) The three dimensional structures of PCM based evaporators from one fold with θ = 79° to four fold with average θ = 36° through origami and double-folded PCM placed on wet soil. (f) The weight changes over time for 3D PCM based evaporators under 0.5 sun (dashed line is the performance of PCM with average θ = 71° placed on wet soil under 1 sun). 
Then, steam evaporators (Fig. S8†) were fabricated by using a widely reported double-layer structure,30–32 consisting of (i) a floatable and heat-insulating polystyrene (PS) foam wrapped with a piece of hydrophilic gauze as a pump to imbibe underlying water, and (ii) a PVA–rCD microgel-loaded cellulose paper as an evaporation interface layer on the top of the foam. To evaluate the vapor generation performance and its influencing factors, several evaporators were fabricated from PCB or PCM with different microgel sizes, solid ratios or CD contents. The evaporation performances were first evaluated under simulated sunlight irradiation with an intensity of 1 kW m−2 (one sun, Fig. S9†). Overall, the PCM-based evaporator showed an obviously higher steam generation rate (e.g., 2.62 kg m−2 h−1 for PCM with a gel size of 3.3 μm, solid content of 5%, and CD content of 13%) than both water without the evaporator (0.38 kg m−2 h−1) and their bulk counterparts (e.g., 1.69 kg m−2 h−1 for PCB with similar solid and CD contents) (Fig. 3c). For the PCM-based evaporators, CD contents and oxidation degrees obviously influenced the evaporation rate, while microgel sizes have a relatively weak impact on it (Fig. S10–S18†). For example, with the increment of the rCDs/PVA ratio from 0.05:1 to 0.5:1, the evaporation rate increased and then dropped gradually, having a peak value of 2.6 kg m−2 h−1 (Fig. S12†). The evaporator showed the highest performance when the oxygen atom contents of CDs reached 22.2 at%, and a lower or higher value resulted in an inferior performance (Fig. S13†).
Then, the evaporation rates under different irradiation intensities were also studied. When the irradiation intensities increased to 2, 3 and 4 kW m−2, the water evaporation rate increased significantly and reached 3.41, 5.10 and 6.76 kg m−2 h−1 respectively, which are about 1.3, 1.9 and 2.6 times the rate of that under one sun illumination (Fig. 3d). Especially, under weak solar irradiation of 0.2 sun and 0.5 sun, the evaporator showed excellent steam generation rates as high as 0.69 and 1.58 kg m−2 h−1, much higher than those of other evaporators previously reported (e.g., 0.37 kg m−2 h−1 for a graphite powder coated semipermeable collodion membrane composite and 0.7 kg m−2 h−1 for carbon nanotube modified filter paper, both under 0.5 sun-illumination; and 0.8 kg m−2 h−1 for carbon-coated paper (CP) on polystyrene foam under 0.6 sun, Table 1).1,12,33–37

The evaporator has great processability because of its robust and flexible nature. For example, the 2D plain evaporator could be fabricated into 3D structures through origami such as folding to further improve its evaporation rate per floor area (Fig. 3e). The evaporators with an apex angle (θ) of 79° and 71° showed higher evaporation rates per floor area (∼2.18 kg m−2 h−1) than the other two evaporators (1.82 and 1.73 kg m−2 h−1 for the structures with θ = 53° and 36°) under 0.5 sun (Fig. 3f, solid lines; Fig. S19†), much higher than the value of the 2D structure (1.58 kg m−2 h−1). This result probably contributes to their larger water evaporation surface area with the same level of solar energy input,38 as well as their enhanced light absorption capability.39
In addition, the foldable evaporator can also imbibe water from soil through its strong capillary force when placed directly on wet soil without the PS foam and gauze which also showed a desirable evaporation rate (2.0 kg m−2 h−1) under 1 sun, showing its great convenience when used in desert areas or in the wild (Fig. 3e, bottom; Fig. 3f, dashed line).
2.3. Mechanism of high performance
The mechanism of the excellent water generation performance of PVA–rCD microgels was then studied in detail. First, the optical absorption capability of the evaporator was studied through UV-vis-NIR spectrometry. The PVA–rCD microgels exhibited prominent optical absorption capability with a strong absorbance of 90–95% (Fig. 4a), a low reflectance of 3% and a low transmission of <5% over a wide wavelength range (200–2000 nm) (Fig. S20†). As a comparison, the PVA–rCD monolithic hydrogel showed an obviously weaker optical absorbance and a higher optical reflection because of its much flatter surface than microgel assemblies.3,40,41

Inset (left) shows the calculated model showing the close-packed microgels and water channel. (f) The ratio of consumed heat for evaporation to the solar energy input (Qevap/Qsolar) as a function of solar intensity. 
Second, the thermal management of the PVA–rCD evaporator was also investigated because of its significant effect on the energy utilization efficiency.16,17 Water distribution was first studied in situ by using an optical microscope in a reflection mode, where rhodamine B (Rh B) as a fluorescent probe molecule was added into the underlying water reservoir for clear contrast. Similar to the SEM results, the PVA–rCD microgels possessed a quasi-spherical shape, packing closely and uniformly throughout the whole surface according to the dark field images (Fig. 4b). Furthermore, the water distributions could be clearly depicted from the red fluorescence signals in the dark images, which showed interesting hollow structures in the top layers of the evaporator (Fig. 4b, inset), demonstrating that the underlying water was imbibed to the top of the evaporator along the microgel surfaces. These liquid–air interfaces wrapped around the microgel can not only significantly facilitate vapor generation due to its large surface, but also contribute to a more prominent heat localization effect associated with their microstructures beneficial for light trapping when compared with the bulk gel.42,43 In addition, the thermal conductivity of PCM was measured to be 0.23 W m−1 K−1, lower than that of PCB (0.33 W m−1 K−1), probably resulting from the limited contact area of the microgels (Fig. 4c, d and S21†).
More importantly, the law of thermodynamics demonstrates that the evaporation rate should be no more than 1.47 kg m−2 h−1, even if all the solar energy was transformed to compensate for the enthalpy change from free water in the underlying reservoir to vapor, regardless of the intermediate state of water (Calculation S1†).34 Our ultrahigh experimental results (e.g. 2.6 kg m−2 h−1) obviously exceed the theoretical limit of thermodynamics, which was then attributed to the thermal energy from the environment as an extra energy input according to our theoretical calculation results (Calculation S2†). In detail, the temperature distribution of the evaporator can be theoretically predicted by employing heat transfer equations and heat equilibrium equations. Briefly, a geometric model composed of densely packed spheres was established to describe the main parameters, in which the interspace of the microspheres functions as a water channel. The model was simplified as a semi-infinite medium under the Cartesian coordinate system with two separated heat transfer equations for the solid and for water in the channel respectively. Under steady-state conditions, an equilibrium equation was therefore given, which was solved by introducing the boundary conditions (the temperatures of water, solid surface and interface heat transfer equation). The obtained results revealed that there are different temperatures for water and solid phases, and the evaporation interface has a slightly lower temperature (around 27.5 °C in our system) than that of the environment (28 °C) due to the evaporation process (cooling) occurring at the surface (Fig. 4e).12 Therefore, in this case, the system could take energy from the environment, possessing a limit-breaking evaporation rate. This theoretical results were also partially proved by the steam generation experiments under low solar illumination, where the ratio between the consumed heat for evaporation (Qevap) and the whole solar energy input (Qsolar) to the system increased from 1.3 to 2.6 with the decrement of solar intensity because of the enhanced contribution to the evaporator from environmental heat with the surficial temperature decreasing (Fig. 4f and S22, Calculation S3†).
2.4. Desalination experiments
The desalination capability of the evaporator was then tested by employing real seawater. Notably, the evaporation rates were comparable with that of pure water, and exhibited superior durability under continuous illumination for 10 h at least (Fig. 5a). The Na+, Mg2+, K+, and Ca2+ ion concentrations of condensed water vapor were measured to be 0.427, 0.651, 0.285, and 0.296 mg L−1, respectively, which were lower by nearly 4 orders of magnitude than those in pristine seawater (Fig. 5b).

(b) The measured Na+, Mg2+, K+, and Ca2+ ion concentrations in actual seawater (obtained from the East China Sea) before and after desalination by using PCM. The dashed green and purple lines denote the salinity criterion for drinkable water regulated by the World Health Organization (WHO) and US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). (c) The incident solar intensities, the temperatures of the PCM surface and ambient environment, and the evaporation rates were recorded from 8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. on a sunny day. (d) The amount of condensed fresh water during 10 h outdoor solar desalination. Inset: photograph of a simple home-made desalinated device with a scale bar of 10 cm.

(f) Photograph of the as-fabricated PCM deposited on filter paper by blade-casting; the diagram of the coating process for the potential of continuous mass production; photograph of the PCM extract filtered through filter paper; the winding and stacking for the evaporator; the broken PCB after folding operation (from left to right and top to bottom). 
The availability of our evaporator operated in an outdoor environment was also evaluated (from 8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m.; the evaporator is 18 cm in diameter, Fig. S23†). The vapor generation results were comparable with those of indoor experiments, showing a strong dependence on the illumination intensity (for example, 1.91 kg m−2 h−1 for 0.74 kW m−2) (Fig. 5c). In the following, the generated vapor was successfully condensed to get purified water by building a simple home-made device. The purified water showed a high yield of approximately 12.5 L per m2 per day (Fig. 5d) and very low ion concentrations (0.307 mg L−1 for Na+, 0.113 mg L−1 for Mg2+, 0.192 mg L−1 for K+ and 0.258 mg L−1 for Ca2+; Fig. 5e), satisfying drinking water criteria stipulated by the World Health Organization (WHO) and US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).44,45
The large-scale production ability and practical availability of our evaporator were also corroborated. First, all of the raw materials, including polyvinyl alcohol, liquid paraffin, hydrochloric acid etc., are commercially available and cheap. Specially, the CDs adopted here as the key photothermal component in our evaporator are also able to be easily prepared by electrically stripping graphite rods in water without adding any other chemicals and can be facilely purified through the developed ultrafiltration technique (Fig. S24†). Second, the synthesized microgels can be simply deposited on a substrate (filter paper here) with an arbitrary shape by a vacuum filtration or blade casting process (Fig. 5f and S25†), and their extensive continuous production is feasible by employing the coating technique. Furthermore, the PCM film is greatly flexible, processable and portable (e.g. winding or stacking), showing the potential of its practical applications.
2.5. Tree-inspired solar-driven water vertical transportation
Inspired by water transportation in trees driven by a transpiration-induced chemical potential difference,17 a simple model was designed to realize solar-driven water vertical transportation with the assistance of the interfacial evaporation technique and consisted of three parts: (i) a solar steam generator imitating the leaves, (ii) a forward osmosis (FO) membrane akin to the root, and (iii) a tube as xylem for continuous water conduction (Fig. 6a). In this case, draw solutions (concentrated NaCl) can extract pure water from feed solutions, which can be in situ concentrated through solar-driven interfacial evaporation, ensuring that this system can operate continually to transport underlying water upward. Therefore, our tree-inspired system could extract a low-lying water source like seawater or lake water. The theoretical height to which water can be transported can be predicted according to the Van't Hoff equation:46h = πosmotic/ρg = 2ΔcNaClRT/ρgwhere R is the gas constant, T is the absolute temperature, ΔcNaCl is the initial concentration difference of NaCl solutions, ρ is the density of water, and g is the gravity constant (Tables S2 and S3†).
 Fig. 6  Water transport via FO process. (a) Schematic diagram of water transport and transpiration behavior in a tree and the model combining the forward osmosis process and solar steam generation. (b) The water flux and theoretical height relative to different draw concentrations. 
A device of around 3 m in height, as an example, was constructed, where NaCl solutions of two different concentrations were used as the feed solution and draw solution respectively. As the concentration of the draw solution increased from 1.5 to 5 mol L−1, the water flux through the FO membrane increased from 1.21 L m−2 h−1 to 5.65 L m−2 h−1 when artificial seawater is the feed solution (or from 1.10 L m−2 h−1 to 10.52 L m−2 h−1 for deionized water as the feed solution against the draw solution from 0.05 to 5 mol L−1) (Fig. 6b). At the same time, the interfacial evaporator was induced to maintain the concentration of draw solution stable. By controlling the evaporation area and FO membrane area, the water evaporation rate can be tuned with the water flux to ensure continuous water transport from the bottom to the top of the device, where solar energy and environmental heat can be successfully stored as gravitational potential energy. The rate of energy transformation into gravitational potential (E) was calculated to be 0.01–1.08 J m−2 h−1 (e.g. E = 10.52 L m−2 h−1 × 1000 kg m−3 × 9.81 m s−2 × 10.52/1000 m = 1.08 J m−2 h−1) in our demonstrative system, and the stored energy can be further enhanced by increasing the height of the system and the area of the FO membrane.
3. Conclusions
In summary, a tree inspired solar-driven evaporator was constructed based on PCM to achieve efficient heat confinement by tailoring the structures of microspheres. The microscale sizes of the microgels ensure their large surface area, beneficial to water evaporation. The incorporation of CDs in the PVA microgel matrix ensures highly efficient solar energy harvesting and conversion, which powers steam generation by utilizing the confined heat in the polymeric network. The designed evaporator with a multi-layer structure attains a vapour generation rate of 2.6 kg m−2 h−1 under 1 sun illumination, and environment compensation is a critical factor for the evaporation system. In addition, a simple solar distillation device was established to collect freshwater from seawater with a purified water yield of around 12.5 L per m2 per day under natural sunlight. Simultaneously, by rational combination with the forward osmosis process, the tree-inspired system can achieve water transport against gravity and fulfill the multi-use of solar energy.
4. Experimental section
4.1. Synthesis of CDs and rCDs
Pristine CDs were prepared according to an electrochemical method reported by our group previously.28 Then, the obtained dark-brown solution was filtered and centrifuged at 10000 rpm to remove the sediments, followed by lyophilization to get the solid powder of the pristine CDs. For pristine CD reduction, a 5 mg mL−1 pristine CD aqueous solution containing 4 mg mL−1 hydrazine was sealed in a cuvette and was kept at a temperature of 95 °C for 6, 9, 12 and 15 hours, respectively. After the reaction, the residual hydrazine was removed by dialysis (molecular cutoff of dialysis membrane: 500–1000) in deionized water. Here, the obtained CDs (rCDs) with different reduction time periods were denoted as rCDs-6 h, rCDs-9 h, rCDs-12 h and rCDs-15 h.
4.2. Synthesis of PVA and PVA–rCD microgels
PVA microgels were prepared through a reverse-phase suspension method. In detail, 4 mL of 5 wt% PVA (molecular weight: 105000; hydrolysis degree: 98–99%) solution containing 0.5 mL of HCl (1 mol L−1) was added dropwise into 15 mL of liquid paraffin mixed with 0.4 g of sorbitan monooleate, followed by sonication to get a homogeneous suspension. Then, the suspension was added with 250 μL glutaraldehyde and heated at 50 °C for 5 h under electromagnetic stirring (stirring rate: 600, 1200, or 1800 rpm) or homogenization (shear rate: 6000 rpm). Finally, PVA microgels were obtained by filtration, washing with diethyl ether, ethanol and deionized water, and drying in a vacuum oven at 60 °C. Following the same procedure as those of synthesizing PVA microgels, PVA–rCD microgels were obtained, in which, typically, 31.6 mg of rCDs was added into 4 mL 5 wt% PVA (molecular weight: 105000; hydrolysis degree: 98–99%) solution containing 0.5 mL of 1 mol L−1 HCl.
4.3. Fabrication of the evaporator
A widely reported double-layer structure was adopted, consisting of (i) a floatable polystyrene (PS) foam (typical thickness: 9 mm, diameter: 22 mm) wrapped with a piece of hydrophilic gauze as a pump to imbibe underlying water through the wicking effect and (ii) a PVA–rCD microgels/CMC composite-loaded cellulose paper as the solar absorber on the top of the foam, which was constructed by vacuum filtration or a blade coating process (weight ratio of PVA–rCD microgels:CMC = 8:1).
4.4. Evaluation of solar vapor generation
A xenon lamp (PLS-SXE300D, Beijing Perfectlight Technology Co., Ltd, China) as the solar simulator provides solar illumination. The light intensity was monitored with a power meter (CEL-NP2000, Beijing China Education Au-light Technology Co., Ltd, China). The real-time evaporation mass loss was recorded with an electronic balance (BSA124S-CW, Sartorius, Germany) connected to a computer for calculating the evaporation rate. The temperature distribution was detected using an IR camera (225S/B3S, FOTRIC, America), which was coupled with a computer though AnalyzIR software.
4.5. Material characterization
SEM was performed on a Gemini 500 at 10 kV (Carl Zeiss, Germany). TEM and HRTEM images were obtained with a FEI Tecnai F20 electron microscope at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV (FEI, America). Absorption, reflectance and transmittance spectra were obtained using a UV-vis-NIR UV-3600 double beam spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Japan). FT-IR spectra were recorded on a Hyperion spectrometer (Bruker, Germany). The contact angle measurement was carried out by using the DataPhysics OCA contact-angle analyzer (DataPhysics, Germany). XPS was performed on an Escalab 250Xi photoelectron spectrometer equipped with a monochromatic Al Kα radiation source (Thermo Fisher Scientific, America). ICP-OES was conducted with a Thermo Scientific™ Icap™ 7000 Plus (Thermo Fisher Scientific, America).
