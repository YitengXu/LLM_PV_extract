, Accepted 24th October 2016First published on 24th October 2016AbstractA new series of phenothiazine-based D–A–π–A dyes PZ-1–4 have been designed, synthesized and fully characterized by 1H, 13C NMR, HRMS, UV-vis, fluorescence, and cyclic voltammetry spectroscopy. Benzothiadiazole was introduced into the D–π–A dyes as an additional acceptor. Various donors and new π-spacers have been connected to phenothiazine skeleton on opposite sides to generate PZ-2–4 dyes. The DSSC devices have been systematically investigated by photoelectrochemical experiments, the solar cell of PZ-4 with a simple hexyloxyphenyl group achieves the highest photoelectric conversion efficiency of 6.35%. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation results demonstrate that the large dihedral angle (36.3°) between the π-spacer and phenothiazine in PZ-4 induces better charge separation. Its largest semicircle at intermediate frequencies in electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) prevents the recombination of photoelectrons injected into the titanium dioxide (TiO2) conductive band with I3− in electrolyte, which might be caused by the blocking interaction of the hexyloxy group dye.
Introduction
Solar energy, as a clean and continual energy resource, supplies sustainable developments of our society. Direct and efficient utilization of solar energy is mainly realized by plants, except for photovoltaic power stations and photo-thermal instruments. Along with the development of human society, the contradiction between the production and demand of energy becomes more and more severe. Accordingly, and in view of the environmental and economic issues of photovoltaic fabrications, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are a potential alternative to conventional inorganic solid state solar cells in terms of their low cost, flexibility and easy manufacturing processes.1–5 In DSSCs, dyes play pivotal roles since it governs the photon harvesting and the charge generation as well as separation.6,7 Although metal-containing dyes, such as polypyridyl Ru(II) and porphyrin Zn photosensitizers, have shown excellent photovoltaic performance,8–13 the limited resources and complicated syntheses restrain their application in large scales.14–16 In comparison, the metal-free organic dyes with donor–π–acceptor (D–π–A) structure present promising development potential in view of their comparably high efficiency, low cost, as well as easier preparation and purification.17–23
Since Sun and co-authors reported their metal-free organic dye T2-1, phenothiazine (PTZ) has become a well-known electron-rich skeleton in photosensitizers.24 These dyes were then modified by various electron-donating groups, in which, the dyes possessing a structural feature of direct linkage between additional electron donor and PTZ showed worse photovoltaic performance in their DSSC devices.25–27 It is of great significance to understand the effects of the electron donors on the light-harvesting, electron transfer, as well as their joint contribution to the photovoltaic performance of devices.
Recently, Zhu and co-authors have reported various organic dyes with a new structure of D–A–π–A, in which, benzothiadiazoles were introduced between electron donor and π-bridge moieties as an electron acceptor.28–31 Similar structural dyes of D–A–π–A with quinoxaline, benzotriazole and phthalimide as new electron acceptors were also reported lately.32–40 These additional electron acceptors can be regarded as ‘electron trap’ tools that can modulate the molecular energy gap, broaden the light-harvesting range and promote the electron transfer from donor to anchor.28
We have reported phenothiazine-based D–π–D–A dyes of DPP-1–4, in which π-spacers facilitate intramolecular charge separation via interrupting the conjugation of two electron donors.41 We also take notice that phenothiazine groups have been reported to be used as electron donors in D–A–π–A dyes.42,43 Therefore the π-spacer would improve the electron transfer efficiency of these sensitizers. Herein, we report new dyes of PZ-1–4 (Fig. 1) with a D–A–π–A architecture of phenothiazine–benzothiadiazole (PTZ–BTDA) that is modified by a phenyl π-spacer and electron donor groups such as hexyloxy and diphenylamine.

Experimental section
General
All reagents were of analytical grade quality and used directly without further purification. The solvents were purified by standard methods.44 The fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) conducting glass plates were purchased from Nippon Sheet Glass Co. Ltd. (15 ohm cm−2). The NMR spectra were obtained by using Varian Mercury 300 MHz and JNM-ECS 400 MHz spectrometers. The high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) spectra were acquired by an Orbitrap spectrometer. The UV-vis absorption data were recorded on an UV-3600 spectrophotometer at room temperature. The fluorescence spectra were determined by an F-7000 fluorescence spectrophotometer.
Synthesis and characterization of dyes
The general synthetic procedures of the dyes are displayed in Scheme 1. Dye of T2-1, the key intermediates of A-n and 4-(7-bromobenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazol-4-yl)benzaldehyde were prepared according to literatures.19,24,45–48 Their NMR spectra were in accordance with that in references. Obtained aromatic bromide A-n reacted with bis(pinacolato)diborane by Miyaura borylation reaction to generate aromatic boronate esters B-n49,50 that can be transferred to aromatic aldehyde C-n by the Pd(PPh3)4-assisted Suzuki cross-coupling reactions with 4-(7-bromobenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazol-4-yl)benzaldehyde. Finally, desired dyes PZ-n were gained via Knoevenagel condensation reactions of C-n and cyanoacetic acid. The synthetic procedures and characteristic data of new dyes and intermediates are expatiated in (ESI†).

Preparation of photovoltaic devices
The FTO substrates were cleaned in ultrasonic instrument by H2O, EtOH, acetone for 30 minutes, respectively. The TiO2 paste containing triton X-100 and polyethylene glycol was spin-coated onto a clean FTO glass plate. After scraping unused TiO2 part, a square TiO2 film (0.45 cm × 0.45 cm) on the center of FTO plate was then roasted at 500 °C for 1 h in Muffle furnace. The obtained electrode was soaked promptly into the sensitizer solution (0.5 mM, THF, 24 h) while cooling to 100 °C. Then the dye-absorbed TiO2 photoanode was taken out, washed with CH3CN and dried with argon flow. The cells were manufactured by agglutinating sensitized TiO2 electrodes and platinum electrodes. The acetonitrile electrolyte containing 0.5 M TBP, 0.05 M I2 and 0.6 M DMPII was injected into the devices under vacuum. The injecting hole on counter electrodes was finally sealed with a thin glass cover by hot glue.
Measurements of photoelectrochemistry and electrochemistry
The photoelectric performance of devices were evaluated by J–V curves on a Keithley 2601A Source Meter under AM 1.5G irradiation of San-Ei XES-301S solar simulator. During measurement, the active area (0.16 cm2) was guaranteed by a black mask. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) data of DSSC devices were collected by a Crown facility. A Zahner impedance analyzer (IM6ex) was applied to record their electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS).
The cyclic voltammetry measurements were performed by an electrochemical workstation (CHI 660E) at 25 °C with each dye (0.5 mM) and TBAPF6 (tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate, 0.1 M) in THF using a three-electrode system: Pt auxiliary electrode, Ag/AgCl reference electrode and glassy carbon working electrode (scan rate = 50 mV s−1).
Results and discussion
Photophysical and electrochemical properties
The ultraviolet and visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra of new dyes in THF solution and absorbed onto TiO2 film were shown in Fig. 2. Their photoluminescence (PL) spectra were illustrated in Fig. 3. The absorption wavenumbers, molar absorption coefficients (ε), and normalized fluorescence values were listed in Table 1. Compared with T2-1, a new peak around 359 nm in the spectra of PZ-1–4 is attributed to the BTDA groups in D–A–π–A framework. It is clear to see that larger ε values in the range of 300–400 nm were found in spectra of PZ-2–4 than that of PZ-1 owing to their additional functionalized groups. Otherwise, evident red-shift phenomena were found in the spectra of PZ-1–4 comparing to T2-1. After absorption of PZ-dyes onto TiO2 films, the absorption bands evidently become broader and shift toward visible region, which can enhance their light harvesting abilities.

The electrochemical properties of dyes were investigated via a cyclic voltammetry (CV) method (Fig. S2†) and presented in Table 1. Fig. 4 shows that he HOMO energy levels of these sensitizers are more positive than the standard potential of I−/I3− redox couple (4.75 eV), which ensure thermodynamically downhill regeneration of excited dyes. The LUMO levels of PZ-dyes are more negative than the conduction-band-edge energy level (Ecb) of TiO2,51,52 which possess sufficient driving forces for the electron injection from the excited state of sensitizers into the conduction-band of TiO2. These observations indicate that the redox potentials of the dyes in the ground and excited states are favourable for efficient electron injection to TiO2 conduction band and the dye regeneration by iodine/iodide redox system.

Photovoltaic performance of DSSCs
The photovoltaic properties of dye-sensitized solar cells based on these new dyes were gained and illustrated in Fig. 5. Firstly, when the BTDA unit is inserted between PTZ and cyanoacrylic acid moieties, resulting PZ-1 dye presents better efficiency (5.89%) than T2-1 (4.39%) within their DSSC devices. To enhance the electron-donating capability, a strong electron donor of diphenylamine (DPA) is connected to PTZ part directly yielding PZ-2 dye. Unfortunately, lower photoelectric conversion efficiency (2.62%) was revealed by PZ-2 sensitized solar cell due to the difficulty of electron transfer between two electron donor groups.53 Based on our understanding about π-spacer effect,41 a simple phenyl ring is introduced between DPA and PTZ moieties resulting PZ-3 dye. Higher efficiency (4.97%) of PZ-3 sensitized devices was attributed to the π-spacer of phenyl ring that facilitates electron transfer between two electron donors. When a slightly weaker donor of hexyloxy instead of DPA was attached to PTZ skeleton to generate PZ-4 dye, the highest conversion efficiency (η = 6.35%, Voc = 0.69 V, Jsc = 13.53 mA cm−2) of its device was achieved. This obvious enhancement of Jsc might be owing to strong electron-donating ability of long hexyloxy group and weak π–π interaction among dye molecules absorbed onto the surface of TiO2 electrode. Taking notice of the incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) curves depicted in Fig. 6, the efficiency value of PZ-4 sensitized device is double of that in PZ-2 sensitized device. This phenomenon benefits from the better electron transportation in molecules. We also calculated the current density (Jsc) values (Table 2) for these devices from their IPCE results. The differences from the experimental results are probably attributed to the slight spectral mismatch.54

DFT calculations
For helping to understand the mechanism of electron transportation in molecules of PZ-series dyes and explain the experimental results, their geometries and energies of molecular orbitals were computerized by using a commercial Gaussian program with a hybrid DFT method of B3LYP/6-31G(d, p).55–58 The orbital diagrams of LUMO+1, LUMO, HOMO and HOMO−1 are demonstrated in Fig. 7, in which, the electron density in the HOMO of PZ dyes is mainly distributed on the PTZ unit and additional electron donor groups. In contrast, the electron density in their LUMO is distributed along the BTDA, phenyl and cyanoacrylic acid moiety. These features of electronic distribution guarantee effective charge separation in photo-excited dyes. On the other hand, the electron density in the HOMO−1 of PZ-2–4 dyes is mainly distributed on the PTZ unit and additional electron donor groups while the electron density in their LUMO+1 is distributed along the BTDA, phenyl and cyanoacrylic acid moiety. This also makes a good charge separation and can improve the light-harvesting ability in short wavelength region in accordance with the UV-vis spectra. But PZ-2 shows bad photovoltaic performance in its DSC device due to the difficulty of electron transfer between electron donor and PTZ framework.25 When π-spacer of phenyl ring was introduced between two donors in PZ-3, the photovoltaic performance of its DSSC device enhanced obviously owing to good electron transfer between electron donor and PTZ framework. Furthermore, large torsion angles between PTZ and π-spacer of phenyl ring are found in PZ-3 and PZ-4 (34.9° and 36.3°) and facilitate intramolecular charge separation efficiency.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
To illustrate the interfacial charge transfer process in DSSCs,59–61 Nyquist and Bode spectra are measured by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in dark condition under a forward bias of −0.675 V (Fig. 8). The semicircle at intermediate frequencies in Fig. 8(a) is proportional to the interfacial charge transfer resistance (Rct) at the TiO2 electrode/electrolyte interface. It is clear to see that the Rct decreased in the order of PZ-4 > PZ-1 > PZ-3 > T2-1 > PZ-2. The device with large Rct can suppress the charge recombination and reduce the dark current, thereby improving the Voc of the DSSCs.62 The largest Rct of PZ-4 sensitized device reflects the slowest recombination rate of photoelectrons in TiO2 with I3− species, which can be attributed to block layer formed by the long hexyloxy group.59
 Fig. 8  EIS spectra of DSSCs based on PZ-dyes measured at −0.675 V forward bias in the dark: (a) Nyquist diagram and (b) Bode phase plots. 
The lower frequency peak in the Bode plot (Fig. 8(b)) implies longer lifetime (τe) of injected electron in TiO2 according to the relation τe = 1/(2πf) (f is the peak frequency of lower-frequency range in Bode plots). A longer electron lifetime corresponds to a lower dark current.63 The DSSC based on PZ-4 has the longest electron lifetime, which implies the most effective suppression of the back reaction between the injected electrons and the electrolyte, resulting in the improvement of the Voc.
Conclusions
In summary, new PTZ-based D–A–π–A dyes of PZ-1–4 have been successfully prepared. Their DSC devices demonstrated good photovoltaic efficiency. The photoelectronic conversion efficiency of PZ-1 device is higher than that of T2-1 device because of an additional acceptor of BTDA unit between D and π. The photovoltaic performance of PZ-2 device is worse than that of PZ-1 device due to the difficulty of electron transfer between two donors of DPA and PTZ, resulting lower electron mobility. To solve this issue, a simple π-spacer of phenyl ring is introduced between the additional donor and PTZ. The best photovoltaic performance of PZ-4 dye device is attributed to π-spacer of phenyl ring with a better torsion structure and a better donor of long alkyloxy chain. Otherwise, the alkyloxy chain also plays roles in preventing π–π aggregation among dye molecules on the surface of TiO2 electrode and inhibiting the recombination of electrons with I3− in electrolyte. Therefore, both π-spacer of phenyl and acceptor of BTDA have significantly enhanced electron mobility with more efficient charge separation in excited dyes. In general, this work might provide beneficial references to the molecular engineering of sensitizers for developing highly efficient dye-sensitized solar cells.
