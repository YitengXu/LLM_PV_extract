    , Accepted 7th January 2019First published on 7th January 2019AbstractAn innovative photo-enhanced aqueous redox battery (PEARB) built upon a simple two-electrode configuration is demonstrated. The synergy of the photo-cathode and battery-anode is realized by directly growing vertically oriented SnS2 arrays on Ti mesh, manifesting advanced photo-electrocatalytic activities. The assembled PEARB achieves 2.5-fold capacity enhancement under solar illumination.
Solar energy has been paid soaring attention as a clean and renewable energy source to date.1 However, due to its intermittency, developing reliable means to synergize the harvesting and storage is indeed imperative. Recent years have witnessed intense research efforts pertaining to solar utilization in redox batteries via the incorporation of photo-electrodes.2,3 For instance, Zhou et al. developed an aqueous sodium-ion cell which can save 90% input electric energy with the aid of a TiO2 photo-anode.4 Very recently, Yu et al. reported an iodine/bromine redox battery driven by a BiVO4 photo-anode, therein realizing a solar-to-output energy conversion efficiency of 1.25%.5 It is interesting to note, in this respect, that many studies were prone to exploiting semiconductor materials (e.g., TiO2, BiVO4, and α-Fe2O36) that generate photoexcited holes to oxidize the redox couple with the electrons flowing through external circuits to attain solar energy storage. However, with respect to other specific semiconductors (e.g., g-C3N4, SrTiO3,7 MoS2, and SnS28) that possess excellent reducing ability, there have rarely been reports on employing them as photo-electrodes by utilizing their photoexcited electrons to reduce the redox couple. Therefore, a meaningful material solution would centre on designing applicable semiconductors capable of producing photoexcited electrons for reliable photo-electrodes in redox battery systems.
SnS2 is a visible-light-responsive semiconductor with multiple merits including non-toxicity, low-cost, and high earth-abundance.9 Upon visible light irradiation, the photoexcited electrons of SnS2 possess excellent reducing activity. The layered structure of SnS2 would offer ample active sites where the chemical reactions could occur. Moreover, SnS2 exhibits favourable electrocatalytic activity toward polysulfide reduction.10 These advantageous features would enable an SnS2 electrode to synergize the key functions of both the photo-cathode and battery-anode within a redox battery system, rendering our innovative design of a two-electrode battery configuration based on such a bifunctional SnS2 electrode. This is in stark contrast to the prevailing three-electrode11 or four-electrode12 configurations (details in Fig. S1, ESI†). Accordingly, throughout a two-electrode design, the complexity of the device is reduced and the tedious switch of the electrodes is avoided, leading to an augmented charge and discharge efficiency.
In this communication, we report a visible-light-responsive photo-enhanced aqueous redox battery (PEARB) built upon the basis of a dual-electrode configuration. On one side, as-grown SnS2 nanostructured film immersed in a sodium polysulfide solution is exploited as a bifunctional electrode synergizing the photo-cathode and cell-anode; on the other side, a super P counter electrode immersed in an aqueous sodium iodide solution is separated by a cation-conductive Nafion-117 membrane, thereby achieving a two-electrode design. This accomplishes two key objectives: (i) the direct harnessing of practicable natural sunlight due to the employment of visible-light-responsive SnS2; and (ii) the simultaneous realization of harvesting and storage of abundant solar energy within one simple device. Of note, the device exhibits marked capacity augmentation (2.5-fold) under illumination at various current densities (0.01, 0.03, and 0.05 mA cm−2), accompanied by a favourable photo-assisted charge/discharge cycling stability.

Fig. 1a illustrates the battery configuration and working principles. In the photo-assisted charge process under illumination, electron–hole pair generation takes place at the surface of SnS2, after which the photoelectrons move to the solid–liquid interface and reduce S42− to S22− (red line). Electrons provided by the external charge circuits follow through the path (black line) and participate in the reduction of polysulfides. The reaction can be described in the expression (1): Anolyte: S42− + 2e− → 2S22− Φ0 = −0.26 VNHE(1)where Φ0 is the normal electrochemical potential for the reaction. The redox potential is −0.45 V versus Ag/AgCl and converts to a NHE potential of −0.26 V by using the equation E(NHE) = E(Ag/AgCl) + 0.1976 V.13 Meanwhile, an iodine anion (I−) is oxidized to an iodine trianion (I3−) because of the loss of electrons at the side of the counter electrode. The reaction can be expressed as in (2): Catholyte: 3I− − 2e− → I3− Φ0 = 0.64 VNHE(2)

In the discharge process, the polysulfide (S22−) and iodine trianion (I3−) reverse back to the initial state to output electric energy. The output voltage of the cell is 0.9 V (0.64 + 0.26 V).
The Mott–Schottky plot of SnS2@Ti mesh was obtained (Fig. S2a, ESI†) with the intercept on the X-axis corresponding to the flat band potential (Vfb),14 which is estimated to be −0.52 V versus Ag/AgCl (−0.32 V vs. NHE pH = 7). Obviously, the Vfb is more negative than the standard reduction potential of polysulfides (−0.26 V vs. NHE). According to the previous report, an estimated flat potential was directly used as the conduction band potential.14 Therefore, it is thermodynamically feasible for photo-generated electrons to reduce polysulfides (photocatalytic process, PC). The band gap of SnS2 is estimated to be 2.33 eV according to the ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectroscopic measurement (Fig. S2b, ESI†), hence, it can be inferred that the valence band potential of SnS2 lies at 2.01 eV. Fig. 1b presents the complete energy diagram of SnS2. In theory, the SnS2 photoelectrode could afford unbiased photoelectrochemical charging; nevertheless, as shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†), this was not achieved in this work. During the photo-assisted charging, the applied negative potential on the photo-cathode enables the initiation of an electrocatalytic (EC) process via SnS2. This would not only accelerate the separation of photoinduced carriers but also extend the relaxation time of the excited state of polysulfides. Upon introducing a visible-light-responsive SnS2 photo-cathode, the synergy of EC and PC processes renders a favourable photoelectrochemical effect toward the realization of the system. Related exploration pertaining to photo-generated carriers is displayed in Fig. S4 (ESI†).
The SnS2 photo-electrode is prepared via in situ hydrothermal growth on Ti mesh (Fig. 2a and Fig. S5, ESI†). The as-formed nanowall- and nanoflower-hierarchical structure of SnS2 could facilitate charge transport and enhance the surface reaction kinetics owing to large contact areas between the liquid phase and the solid phase.15 Herein, the employment of Ti mesh as the growth substrate for SnS2 manifests dual merits: (i) the excellent conductivity of Ti mesh would boost charge transfer; (ii) the tight contact between Ti and SnS2 greatly reduces the ohmic resistance, thereby improving the EC and PC efficiency. Fig. 2b and c show EDS mapping of the SnS2, revealing the uniform distribution of sulfur and tin.

Low-magnified transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observation indeed verifies the flower-like hierarchical structure (Fig. 2d), whilst the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image in Fig. 2f discloses that the spacing between the adjacent lattice plane is 0.21 nm, corresponding to the (102) plane of layered SnS2 crystals. Fig. 2e displays the HRTEM image of the exposed edge of one single nanosheet selected from Fig. 2d. Due to the weak van der Waals interaction, SnS2 shows a well-layered structure with 9 stacked layers. The interlayer distance of 0.59 nm corresponds to the (001) plane of SnS2, which is in agreement with the previous reports.16Fig. 2g shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of SnS2. All of the diffraction peaks can be indexed to hexagonal SnS2 (JCPDS 23-0677). Also, the X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) in Fig. 2h and i further confirm the formation of SnS2.
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was employed to probe the EC process at the electrodes. With respect to the cathode (Super P carbon), CV profiles at different scan rates from 2.5 to 10 mV s−1 in a voltage range of 0.2–0.7 V were acquired, as shown in Fig. 3a. Stable redox peak position and shape suggest that the redox couples (I−/I3−) are electrochemically reversible on the cathode, with a redox potential of 0.45 V versus Ag/AgCl. Fig. 3b manifests CV curves of the SnS2 anode in polysulfide solution at different scan rates from 2.5 to 10 mV s−1 in a voltage range of −0.8 to 0 V. The symmetric redox signals are indicative of favourable EC performance for polysulfides. The redox couples (S42−/S22−) again demonstrate high electrochemical reversibility with a redox potential of −0.45 V versus Ag/AgCl. To verify the presence of the EC effect of the SnS2 anode, a comparison of the CV curves between SnS2 and Pt has been drawn (Fig. S6, ESI†). It is evident that Pt (black line) shows negligible EC activities as compared with that of SnS2 anode (red line). Accordingly, a redox battery was assembled to exploit such high EC activities with the Super P carbon and SnS2 employed as the cathode and anode, respectively. Potentiostatic charge/discharge profiles at the current density of 0.05 mA cm−2 at 1 V were collected (Fig. S7a, ESI†). In parallel, the battery with bare Super P as dual electrodes was tested under the same conditions (Fig. S7b, ESI†). The SnS2 anode exhibits a good cycling performance without distinct decay, a high voltage platform (low polarization), and good Coulombic efficiencies (maintaining at 98% within 10 cycles), which can rival the prevailing carbonaceous materials.17 This result thus validates that the SnS2 electrode can perfectly serve as an anode in the discharge process, leading to the non-necessity of switching the electrode when the photo-assisted charge process is finished.

(g and h) UV-vis absorption spectra of the catholyte and anolyte after the photo-assisted charge from 0 to 30 min. 
The PC process has also been investigated. The transient photocurrent responses in a three-electrode configuration were first measured in a 0.5 M Na2SO4 solution at 0.2 V versus Ag/AgCl (Fig. S8a, ESI†). The resultant photocurrent is ∼20 μA cm−2, which is superior to the previous reports.18 Note that such a high photocurrent response might be attributed to the good electrical conductivity of the supportive Ti mesh and the unique vertically oriented SnS2 arrayed architecture for enhanced light harvesting efficiency. In addition, our SnS2 exhibits excellent degradation activities toward methyl orange (MO) under visible light (Fig. S8b, ESI†), implying advanced visible-light-responsive photocatalytic properties. Fig. 3c shows the linear sweep voltammograms of the SnS2 photo-electrode recorded in a three-electrode cell with/without the presence of light. It can be observed that the peak current under illumination (IM-Photo) is enhanced by nearly two-fold as compared to that in the dark (IM-Dark), indicating that photoexcited electrons in the conductive band of SnS2 can accelerate the reduction of S42− to S22−.19Fig. 3d shows the current responses upon illumination under 1 V potentiostatic charge for an assembled PEARB. When the light is turned off, the current decays rapidly. Our results reveal that applying light becomes the main drive for enhanced charge current and promoted polysulfide reduction. In addition, the thermal effect on the performance of PEARB was also probed (Fig. S9, ESI†). Fig. 3e shows the potentiostatic charge profile at 1 V. Note that the current gradually increases in the course of photo-charging and then stabilizes (Fig. 3d and e). It is likely that the growing amount of photoinduced carriers at the beginning tends to react with solution ions to boost the current. Upon further illumination, such interfacial reactions reach dynamic equilibriums, thereby leading to current stability. The corresponding galvanostatic discharge profiles were collected at various current densities (0.01, 0.03, and 0.05 mA cm−2) (Fig. 3f). Evidently, upon charging for identical duration, light illumination unexceptionally results in a prolonged discharge time at various current densities, suggesting a capacity enhancement (C = it).
To intentionally confirm such capacity enhancement, a comparison of related capacity curves between light and dark states is drawn (Fig. S10, with photo-electron conversion efficiency calculated, ESI†). A significant increase in charge current and thus the capacity can be identified when exposed under light. It is worth noting that, however, there exists a moderate Coulombic efficiency (70%) and low discharge voltage plateau, which might be attributed to the following two aspects: (i) gradual evaporation/loss of electrolyte upon prolonged illumination (3 h for illumination and 10 h for discharge) would induce noticeable polarization; and (ii) lower electrolyte concentration would exhibit larger electrochemical resistance (Fig. S11 and discussion therein, ESI†). Fig. 3g and h display the illumination time-dependent UV-vis absorption spectrum of I3− and S22− within the catholyte and anolyte, respectively. The signal augmentation corroborates that the EC and PC processes exert a synergistic impact on promoting the reduction of polysulfide and the oxidation of iodine.
The cycling stability of the PEARB was further evaluated by the potentiostatic charge and galvanostatic discharge measurements. The total 10 cycle charge and discharge profiles are shown in Fig. 4. The red and black lines represent the charge current in the dark and under illumination, respectively (Fig. 4a). After 10 min charge, the current is stable at 0.32 mA cm−2 (under illumination) and 0.15 mA cm−2 (in dark) within 10 cycles. Shedding light achieves a two-fold current improvement without significant attenuation. In response, the results obtained from galvanostatic discharge profiles are in good agreement with the charging (Fig. 4b). Notably, the discharge time evidently exhibits a 2.5-fold extension after photo-charging at 0.01 mA cm−2 (5.2 h discharge upon photo-charging vs. 2 h discharge after dark-charging). Such conspicuous disparity between discharge time serves as solid evidence of the solar-driven capacity enhancement. In addition, PEARB possesses a prolonged discharge platform after photo-charging as compared to that from the dark-charging, implying that the illumination aids in achieving a much-reduced polarization. Of note, the solar-driven capacity enhancement trend can be well maintained by cyclic charge–discharge, indicative of the good cycling stability of our SnS2 photo-electrode. As a proof-of-concept demonstration, the PEARB after photo-charging were further assembled as a portable energy storage device, which is able to power a red light-emitting-diode indicator via the connection in series (Fig. S12, ESI†).

In summary, our devised PEARB realized a capacity enhancement via the incorporation of a visible-light-responsive SnS2 photo-electrode. Such an SnS2 electrode exhibited a unique hierarchical structure (vertically oriented nanowall array grown on Ti mesh), accordingly offering large contact areas for polysulfide reaction and adequate active sites for the photogeneration of carriers. The key design of our PEARB lies also in the fact that the SnS2 photo-electrode can be employed as an anode in the discharge process, which simplified the battery configuration to two electrodes. Upon synergizing the EC and PC effect of SnS2, the discharge time increases from 2 h to 5.2 h. We anticipate that the attributes described here open possible opportunities in the system design toward large-scale grid storage and exploration of appropriate electrode materials that fully exploit natural sunlight in a practical manner.
