    , Accepted 27th September 2021First published on 28th September 2021AbstractLuminescent solar concentrators (LSCs) are becoming an increasingly relevant topic for building integrated photovoltaics. Even if such devices are relatively simple planar waveguides doped with a luminescent material, the achievement of relevant efficiencies requires a careful optimisation of both the matrix and the luminophore. Most of the recent literature focuses on the performance, yet the overall sustainability of the strategy is a topic at least as important. In this respect the luminophore plays a crucial role. Suitable materials must feature a near unit emission quantum yield, efficient light harvesting and a large separation between absorption and emission to reduce reabsorption losses. Due to the target application, such materials must also be readily available in large quantities through sustainable processes. Instead of going for performance first and then scaling up/optimising the synthesis, in this paper we offer a reversed perspective. We have first designed and computationally characterised materials having structural features compatible with a green chemistry synthetic approach, namely, micellar catalysis. Later, we have characterised the most promising materials in LSC devices, and we have compared their performance with commercially available, non-green chemistry compliant alternatives having similar spectral features. In the overall, we demonstrate comparable performance, but greatly improved sustainability and scalability.
Introduction
Luminescent solar concentrators (LSCs)1,2 are experiencing a major resurgence of interest. Originally investigated in the seventies, when the increasing cost of silicon required alternative approaches to renewable electricity production, they remained below the radar for a long while for their lack of performance. LSCs are now experiencing a rejuvenation due to important breakthroughs in the design of luminescent materials with suppressed reabsorption losses (large Stokes shift), enabling the fabrication of large area devices that are intrinsically suitable for building integrated photovoltaics. New device concepts for architectural integration of solar technologies such as LSC-based electrodeless photovoltaic (PV) windows are instrumental in the design of near-zero-energy buildings, a key feature to boost sustainability in densely populated areas.3–5 A planar LSC consists of a high optical quality plastic or glass slab containing or coated by a luminescent material capable of absorbing sunlight and efficiently emits radiation, as much as possible down shifted to avoid reabsorption. Since the refractive index of the slab is higher than that of air, most of the luminescence (depending on the refractive index mismatch between air and guiding material) is guided by total internal reflection to the LSC edges, where it is converted into electricity by efficient solar cells placed at the edges.2,6 As the device is transparent, it can be flawlessly integrated into buildings with aesthetically pleasing effects.7
The choice of the guiding material is crucial in reducing the fraction of light escaping the waveguide and in reducing scattering and parasite absorption,8 yet the core of a performing LSC is the luminescent material. The literature on such topic is vast and includes (a) well-established and industrially scaled up luminophores of the perylene bis imide family (Lumogen F Orange 240 and F Red 305) having high emission efficiencies but plagued by strong reabsorption losses;9 (b) very high Stokes shift but poor light harvesting UV-Vis absorption dyes and lanthanide complexes;10–12 (c) inorganic and hybrid colloidal quantum dots;13,14 and (d) NIR harvesting derivatives for transparent devices.15 The research in the field is very active as the perfect luminophore capable of showing both performance and low cost is still missing. Of course, the luminophore is just one of the three main elements of the LSC, also comprising the host material (PMMA) and the external PV modules. The industrial cost of PMMA is around 4 € per kg. The concentration of the dye is generally between 100 and 200 ppm. Referring to the price of Lumogen dyes, the only industrially scaled dyes available for the application, this translates into 10–20 € per kg of PMMA.16 The cost of the external PV modules is constantly decreasing but, at the time of this writing, averaged around 70 € per kg of slab. Overall, the cost of the luminophore is not the main factor in the pricing of the technology but is not negligible either.
The design guidelines for the preparation of a performing chromophore are known:17 the presence of a charge transfer interaction between donor and acceptor groups upon excitation,18 planarity and extension of the conjugated bridge connecting molecular units19 and bulky groups preventing aggregation are a common trait of performing materials having large Stokes shifts.20 Yet there is a wide variability in the structures proposed as well as in the complexity and overall sustainability of the corresponding synthetic paths required. The field of conjugated materials for (opto)electronic applications is now past the stage of proof of concept and is rapidly evolving towards scaling up and precompetitive evaluation. At this stage, it is not infrequent that materials having excellent properties at the lab scale, quite simply do not make sense when scaling up on the grounds of cost and/or sustainability. The field of OPV devices represents a very good case study in this respect.21–24 LSCs are no different; due to the target application, luminophores must be exceptionally rugged and easily available due to the quantities involved.3 When designing new chromophores, performances generally come first and scaling up is considered in a subsequent step. In this paper we decided to turn the table around and, while keeping in mind the general rules for high efficiency materials, we designed chromophores using a de novo approach based on structural simplicity, availability and cost of raw materials, sustainability and efficiency of synthetic procedures and adherence to the recommendations of green chemistry as prerequisites in the design of intrinsically scalable materials. Recently, some of us described the first application of such new design criteria in the preparation of efficient and sustainable LSCs having an optical quantum efficiency higher than 50%.25 Although remarkable, such devices had a particularly poor light harvesting capability due to the nature of the luminophore we designed, a [1]benzothieno[3,2-b][1]benzothiophene (BTBT) derivative with limited conjugation length.25
In this paper we extend our de novo synthesis and design approach to a series of high Stokes shift derivatives featuring at the same time large spectral separation, suitable emission efficiency and exceptionally easy and green synthetic access. The new luminophores are fully characterized both in solution and as the active components of small and large area LSCs, demonstrating performances exceeding those of Lumogen chromophores in the field of large area devices, particularly sought by the market.
Design and computational insight
Aiming at the development of high Stokes shift derivatives, we focused our attention on donor–acceptor–donor molecules featuring easily accessible building blocks we could combine through a straightforward, sustainable chemistry approach. 2,1,3-Benzothiadiazole is an acceptor with a considerable track record as a building block in luminescent materials and can be efficiently coupled with a variety of heteroaromatics, including the π-excessive thiophene.26–32
We particularly focused on the 4,7-dithien-2-yl-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (DTB) structural motif. DTB features a sizeable, high Stokes shift and high molar absorptivity.33,34 It is a simpler analogue of the more performing but synthetically challenging benzothiadiazole bridged derivatives introduced by some of us in the past.35 Indeed, such diaryloxybenzoheterodiazole derivates proved to be exceedingly efficient but challenging in terms of accessibility due to the use of 4,7-dibromo-5,6-difluoro-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (DBBF) as the main starting material.35
In this work, we propose a new class of benzothiadiazole bridged derivatives featuring 4,5,6,7-tetrathien-2-yl-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole core (TTB) as the most distinctive structural feature. The main advantage of such a choice is the possibility to use the cheap and widely available 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole as the starting material and to proceed, at least up to a certain point in the synthesis, with a symmetric functionalization. We thus designed the three derivatives TT1, TT2 and TT3 as viable targets featuring properties suitable for LSC applications. Scheme 1. Moreover, TT3 offers the possibility of introducing stronger donor and acceptor substituents in the terminal phenyl groups, yielding TT4 and TT5, respectively, opening further degrees of freedom in the tailoring of optical properties without introducing further synthetic complexity.
 Scheme 1  Chemical structure of the new TTB luminophores. 
Prior to proceeding with the synthesis, we validated the design approach through a computational analysis.
The optimized geometries of the five investigated molecules are shown in Fig. 1, together with their frontier orbitals. The molecules are all characterized by a conjugated yet nonplanar structure, with the benzothiadiazole central unit forming solid angles with the 1,4 thiophene “wings” ranging from 35° in the case of TT2 to 47° in the case of TT3. All the molecules have HOMO orbitals widely distributed across the backbone, with features like those reported in the case of oligo- or poly-thiophenes, while LUMO orbitals are much more localized on the electron-acceptor benzothiadiazole central unit; the corresponding energy values are all listed in Table 1.

This kind of orbital partitioning in conjugated, twisted molecular structures is a prerequisite to observe strong absorption and large Stokes shift values. Regarding absorption, TDDFT vibronic spectra are shown in Fig. 2a. Strong S0 → S1 transitions that can be observed for all the molecules between 350 and 600 nm, as also summarized in Table 1, arise from such spatial distribution of frontier orbitals: as exemplified in Fig. 2c in the case of TT1, a significant charge displacement from side thiophene units (blue regions undergoing charge depletion upon excitation) to the benzothiadiazole central core (red regions undergoing charge accumulation) is responsible for the sizable oscillator strength of such S0 → S1 electronic transitions.

(c) Density difference between S0 (ground state) and S1 (first singlet excited state) of TT1. Upon excitation, electronic charge is displaced from blue regions to red regions. (d) S0 and S1 optimized geometries of TT1; α and β are solid angles between the benzothiadiaziole unit and the first thiophene side ring, and between the first and second thiophene units, respectively. (e) Optimized geometry of a TT1 dimer. (f) Normalized TDDFT absorption of an isolated TT1 (red curve) and of a TT1 dimer (blue curve). All the calculations have been performed using the PBEh-3c functional. 

TT2, featuring the largest conjugation, is characterized by the smallest optical gap in the series as well as by the strongest absorption intensity. TT3 is the most blue shifted of the series whilst TT1 absorption maximum falls in between those of TT2 and TT3. TT4 and TT5, whose MeO- and F- substituents extend frontier orbitals to the farthest phenyl groups, placed midway between TT3 and TT1.

Fig. 2b shows TDDFT normalized vibronic absorption and emission spectra, anticipating large Stokes shifts in all cases, as also reported in Table 1.
As we will discuss in the optical characterization paragraph, such data are slightly overestimated due to the large contribution of exact-exchange (42%) to the PBEh functional we employed. This choice was dictated by the unsatisfactory results obtained with the B3LYP functional (20% of exact-exchange) in the description of charge-transfer excitations such as those which characterize the TT1–5 series.
Finally, hindered rotations of all 4 surrounding thiophene units are expected to prevent vibronic routes to non-radiative recombination of molecular excitation, thus anticipating a high fluorescence quantum yield. Such emission yield is also favoured by the strong absorption, which is not suppressed or even attenuated in the case of cofacial-like aggregation and is compatible with linear scaling of the maximum absorbance as a function of dye loading reported in Fig. 4. More specifically, large Stokes shift values are a consequence of the geometry changes occurring in the S0–S1 transition. As exemplified again in the case of TT1 (Fig. 2d), the α and β solid angles between benzothiadiazole and thiophene units and between two consecutive thiophene units, respectively, drop from values of 35° and 17° in the case of the ground state to values of 8° and 4° in the case of the S1 excited state. This results in an extended conjugation of the molecule, lowering the energy of the excited state and, in turn, inducing a red shift of the emission.
Aggregation in the solid state may significantly alter the optoelectronic properties of molecular materials. We have simulated a simple TT1 dimer as a prototypical aggregate system. The optimized structure shown in Fig. 2e is the result of a large-scale exploration of configurations performed using tight-binding simulations and then refined using DFT-based simulations. Regarding the structural properties, we note that the strong interaction between large, conjugated aggregates induces a partial flattening of the α and β solid angles in the TT1 dimer. Such a structural feature is echoed in the normalized absorption spectrum plotted in Fig. 2f (blue curve), where both the main peaks are slightly red-shifted with respect to the isolated molecule, in suggestive agreement with the results obtained in the case of the high-concentration samples and discussed below.
Having thus validated the design approach, we developed a sustainable synthesis protocol for the TTB family.
Synthesis and evaluation of sustainability
We based our approach on the guidelines of Green Chemistry, paying particular attention to the reduction of the E-factor, a metric gaining relevant attention in industrial chemistry and corresponding to the ratio between the weight of the wastes produced (solvents and solids) and that of the product.36
Accepted values in the field of pharmaceutical chemistry, the area where complexity of synthetic pathways is highest, are in the order of a few hundreds. In the context of organic semiconductors, such values are seldom described, but in general well more than several tens of hundreds. In this respect, organic solvents are by far the most important source of waste.
Over the last 10 years, micellar chemistry has had a major impact on changing this scenario, convincingly demonstrating that the general hydrophobicity of organic products and intermediates does not represent a limit in the use of water as the main and often only solvent.37–40 We have been amongst the first to apply this concept to the synthesis of conjugated molecules for printed electronics.41–44
As is shown in Scheme 2, our protocol starts with the tetrabromination of 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole, carried out in sulfuric acid in 70% yield. The resulting tetrabromobenzothiadiazole 1 was coupled with thiophene-2-boronic acid according to a S–M micellar reaction performed in a 2 wt% solution in water of a 7:3 wt/wt mixture of two industrial surfactants, Kolliphor EL (K-EL) and Span 80. The peculiar reaction medium was selected according to our previous experience with the coupling of 4,7-dibromo-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole and thiophene-2-boronic acid.44 The synthesis proceeds smoothly at room temperature and the purification involves an extractive crystallization in a Soxhlet apparatus requiring minimal amount of organic solvents. The thus prepared TTB core was recently exploited as branching point for OPVs active molecules and can be recovered in essentially quantitative yield.45
 Scheme 2  General scheme for the synthesis of 4,5,6,7-tetrakis(thiophene-2-yl)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (TTB) and 4,7-di(5-bromo-thiophene-2-yl)-5,6-di(thiophene-2-yl)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole. 
Careful control of the reaction environment and conditions enabled the selective preparation of 4,7-di(5-bromo-thiophene-2-yl)-5,6-di(thiophene-2-yl)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole 3. This kind of reaction generally requires chlorinated solvents or aprotic dipolar ones like DMF. Industry is moving towards greener alternatives in order to minimize the use of toxic material.46 We successfully profited from the good dissolving capabilities and remarkable chemical inertness of (trifluoromethyl)benzene to carry out the reaction under mild conditions, allowing the recovery of the pure product by filtration in 75% yield. Intermediate 3 provided access to all the TTB derivatives, according to the same general reaction protocol shown in Scheme 3.
 Scheme 3  General scheme for the synthesis of TT1–5 derivatives, and their E-factors. 
In this case, we exploited an emulsion S–M coupling (a strategy frequently defined as the co-solvent approach in the dedicated literature) instead of the micellar one. We have previously observed that highly substituted and sterically crowded derivatives like bromide 3 do not react smoothly in aqueous micellar solutions due to the formation of sticky lumps.47 To guarantee the correct dispersion of the reagents, a small amount of cosolvent (in less than stoichiometric amount with respect to the reagents), vigorous stirring and heating are needed in order to maintain the emulsion stable at all reaction stages. To demonstrate the generality of the approach we extended our protocol to derivatives involving boronic acids other than those directly leading to TT1–3. Only in the case of product TT5 the reaction was carried out at room temperature to compensate the strong tendency for protodeborylation of 2,4-difluorophenylboronic acid.
In all the cases, processing required only minimal amounts of organic solvents, mostly employed in the final crystallization purification. Chromatographic purification was completely avoided in all reaction steps. We evaluated the E-factor for the complete synthesis of all compounds, starting from 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole as the common raw material. The values range from 216 (derivative TT1) to 483 (derivative TT3), thus in all the cases within the few hundreds typical of pharmaceutical chemistry. Such values make it an even stronger case for the validity of our approach when compared with the value of 1192 recently estimated for the synthesis of the perylene derivative Lumogen R305, the standard luminophore for LSC applications.25
Photophysical properties
We carried out a preliminary optical characterization in solution for all TTB luminophores. Table 2 and Fig. 3 summarize the main spectral characteristics of such compounds, to be compared with the computational values we previously discussed for TT1–5 (Table 1 and Fig. 2). We also included the parent TTB core for comparison. We generally observed a good fit between computational and experimental data.

 Fig. 4  Absorption spectra and PL spectra recorded in the front-face-emission configuration at increasing luminophore concentrations of (a) TT1-based LSCs (b) TT2-based LSCs and (c) TT3-based LSCs. In the inset: normalized PL spectra at increasing luminophore concentrations of (a) TT1-based LSCs (λexc = 490 nm) (b) TT2-based LSCs (λexc = 506 nm) and (c) TT3-based LSCs (λexc = 434 nm). 
Coherently with the general features of donor–acceptor–donor compounds, the optical gap of the various derivatives was the largest for the parent unsubstituted TTB core and smallest for the more conjugated terthiophene functionalized TT2. The trend in the magnitude of the molar absorptivity closely follows the optical gap so that the larger values of the former are associated with the smaller ones of the latter.48 With the notable exception of TT2, all derivatives show high luminescence quantum yield, reaching near unit values for TT3 and TT5. As derivatives TT4 and TT5 were not significantly different in terms of photophysical properties with respect to TT1 and TT3, we did not include the former in our LSC studies.
Reabsorption-free LSC systems
We tested the performances of TT1–3 in LSC devices using a thin-film configuration, where polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) is the host matrix and N-BK7 optical glass (SCHOTT) as the substrate (see the Experimental section for further details).49

Fig. 4 shows the absorption and photoluminescence (PL) spectra in front-face configuration of the LSCs we prepared at increasing luminophore concentration (1–10 wt%). The absorbance grows linearly with luminophore concentration for all systems. The emission intensity grows steadily with a luminophore loading up to a threshold concentration in the 5–7 wt% range. Above this limit, we observed a reduction in the PL intensity, accompanied by a bathochromic shift of the peak maximum (8, 14 and 26 nm for TT3, TT1 and TT2). These trends suggest the presence of dissipative re-absorption phenomena likely attributable to the slight overlap between absorption and emission spectra,50 as will be discussed in the following paragraphs.
The relative PL intensity values we recorded for TT2-based are much smaller than those of TT1-based and TT3-based at all concentrations. The differences in the relative emission quantum yields alone (Table 2), do not fully explain this phenomenon. The poor solubility of TT2 could lead to the formation of crystalline dye aggregates in the PMMA film, quenching fluorescence and giving rise to non-negligible scattering losses (see Fig. S2 in the ESI†). We thus discarded TT2-based LSCs from further analysis. Focusing on TT1- and TT3-based systems, we evaluated the absorption efficiency (ηabs) at each loading level as a quantitative measure of the match between the absorption response of the luminophore and the emission spectrum of the incident (solar) light (ηabs → 1 should be sought for best match, see eqn (S2) in the ESI† for details on calculations). In line with solution spectral properties, TT1 outperformed TT3 at all concentrations. In addition (Fig. 5a), ηabs was found to gradually increase with absorbance, following an exponential trend in all systems.
 Fig. 5  (a) ηabs of LSCs at maximum absorbance (λabs,max = 434, 490 nm for TT3 and TT1, respectively) in the wavelength range 300–800 nm. (b) Self-absorption efficiency of TT3- and TT1-based thin film LSCs (ηself) vs. maximum absorbance (viz., luminophore concentration). The dashed lines represent the exponential fit to the experimental results. Fitting equations and related coefficients of determination are also displayed. 
Also, at any given maximum absorbance, ηabs was found to be larger for TT1vs.TT3 due to the greater overlap between the absorption spectra of the dye and the emission spectrum of the incident light source.
Low reabsorption losses are critical for high efficiency; we thus evaluated the self-absorption efficiency ηself at increasing dye loading as a function of maximum absorbance (see eqn (S3) in the ESI†). ηself provides a measure of the fraction of primary emitted photons reaching the edges of the LSC without being lost due to reabsorption events from neighbouring luminophore molecules (ηself → 1 indicates no reabsorption effects). It is a parameter strictly related to the overlap between the absorption and emission spectra of the luminophore (the so-called radiative overlap, as discussed in Section S.10 in the ESI†). Fig. 5b shows that ηself has an exponential decay with respect to optical density (Amax) (viz. luminophore concentration) for both derivatives, but TT3-based consistently outperforms TT1-based LSCs. Quite remarkably, ηself values found in these systems are significantly lower than those reported for benchmark LSCs doped with commercial organic dyes at comparable loading (e.g., highly concentrated devices) based on PMMA embedding Lumogen F Red 305 (LR305 from here on) typically exhibit ηself ≈ 0.16–0.34.51,52 These evidences are key in highlighting the comparative advantages of using TT1,3 dyes with respect to perylene dyes in LSCs.
LSC device performance and Monte Carlo ray-tracing modelling
We assessed the optical performance of lab-scale (5 × 5 × 0.6 cm3, G = 2.08) TT1- and TT3-based LSCs in terms of their external (ηext) and internal (ηint) photon efficiency at increasing luminophore concentration (numerical values are listed in Table S2 in the ESI†).53

TT1 exhibits higher ηextvs.TT3 at all doping levels, because of the more favourable match between the absorption spectra of this dye and the solar emission spectrum (i.e., higher ηabs). In particular, we observed a maximum ηext ≈ 5.0% for TT1-based LSCs, which is comparable with the highest values recently reported in the literature for devices with equivalent dimensions tested under similar irradiation conditions and doped with luminophores having analogous spectral response.51,54 We obtained an opposite trend for ηint, comparatively prevailing for TT3-based devices. This behaviour can be attributed to the larger ηself in TT3vs.TT1, which entails the improved light guiding ability of the emitted photons given the intrinsically lower probability of reabsorption processes. The resulting maximum ηint (≈40%) is among the best values reported in the literature for organic luminescent dyes.25,55
To better assess the extent of reabsorption losses and their effect on LSC response, we recorded the optical performance (integrated output power) of TT1- and TT3-based devices as a function of the distance between the excitation spot and the collection edge (optical pathlength, d). See Fig. 6a.
 Fig. 6  (a) Normalised integrated single-edge optical power output (OP) as a function of optical distance d under 1 sun top illumination of TT3- and TT1-based systems. The dashed lines indicate the fitting curves for TT1 (fitting equation: OP = 0.71 + 0.29·exp(−0.24·d), R2 = 0.99) and TT3 (fitting equation: OP = 0.63 + 0.37·exp(−0.31·d), R2 = 0.99). (b) Simulated ηext (solid lines) and C (dashed lines) as a function of the geometric gain G for TT3-, TT1- and LR305-based LSC devices (the symbols indicate experimentally determined values). The Csat values are also reported. (c) Simulated ηint as a function of the geometric gain G for TT3-, TT1- and LR305-based LSC devices (the symbols indicate experimentally determined values). 
The output power remains in all cases constant for d higher than 5 cm, suggesting that for larger devices the emitted photons can propagate freely within the lightguide, thus reaching the collecting edge without significant optical losses (only a slight performance decrease at shorter distances was observed, mainly attributable to geometric effects). This behaviour can be associated with the negligible radiative overlap observed in these luminophores (Fig. S3, ESI†), which strongly limits photon self-absorption phenomena. Interestingly, the minor role of reabsorption losses in TT1 and TT3 systems was further confirmed by the evolution of their normalized edge-collected optical power spectra, where no significant bathochromic shift of the emission peak was observed (Fig. S5 in the ESI†), as opposed to what is normally found in large-radiative-overlap, small-Stokes-shift luminophores such as Lumogen F Red 305.52,56
The suppression of reabsorption losses in our thin-film LSCs anticipates their potential for the fabrication of high-performance large-area devices. To validate this hypothesis, we performed Monte Carlo ray-tracing simulations to predictively model the optical response of TT1- and TT3-based LSC devices of increasing geometric gain G (defined as the ratio between top and edge surface area) in terms of ηint, ηext and concentration factor C = G·ηext (see Fig. 6b and c). For benchmarking purposes, we also performed simulations on LR305-doped devices. TT1- and TT3-based LSCs displayed constant performance (both ηint and ηext) for G values of up to ∼50, thus confirming the negligible contribution of reabsorption losses to the overall optical response in these systems.
Conversely, reference LR305-based devices exhibited a marked performance decline in the same range of G values, with ηint and ηext decreasing by 25% and 20%, respectively.
For larger devices, we observed a steady decrease of ηint and ηext in TT1 and TT3 LSCs, mainly ascribable to lightguide-related losses, resulting in a sublinear growth of C with G, until a saturation value was reached (C = Csat, with Csat being 37 and 24 for TT1- and TT3-based LSCs, respectively). However, when compared with benchmark LSCs based on LR305, both our new systems achieved Csat at higher G values (G = 4200, 5500, and 2100 for TT1, TT3 and LR305, respectively), due to weaker reabsorption losses. In addition, TT1-based devices displayed a higher Csat value than LR305 systems (Csat = 37 vs. 30), suggesting a higher maximum achievable output photon flux density. Interestingly, despite the comparatively lower PLQY (Table 1) and ηabs, TT1-based LSC devices outperformed LR305-based ones at higher G (>500). Similarly, as a result of the highest ηself (Fig. 5b), TT3-based LSCs exhibited the best ηint response for all G values considered (Fig. 6c), ultimately indicating excellent cumulative performance in terms of luminophore emission properties and lightguide quality.53 Experimental data obtained on LSC devices of up to G = 6.25 closely replicated the trends observed on modelled systems (Fig. 6b and c), thus confirming the reliability of the simulation results.
Finally, to assess the application potential of these systems as integrated PV devices, we edge coupled to the glass substrate c-Si solar cells connected in series and we measured the light-to-electricity performance of the LSC-PV assemblies. The device efficiency (ηdev, eqn (S8) in ESI† for definition) was recorded at the optimum luminophore concentration (i.e., 5 wt% for TT3-based LSC and 7 wt% for TT1-based systems) in the presence of a dark absorbing background, without employing any reflective element at the free edges of the waveguide. In addition, a black mask was used on the LSC system to avoid direct illumination of the PV cells during testing.53 In these experimental conditions, we measured values of ηdev = 0.51% and 0.30% for TT1- and TT3-based LSCs, which are only slightly lower than in LR305-doped thin-film LSCs, as the effect of reabsorption losses on device performance is known to be less detrimental at such small scale.1,51,57 As expected, TT1-based outperformed TT3 counterpart due to the better spectral match with the solar emission (viz., higher ηabs). We calculated that with a 5 × 5 cm2TT1-LSC, our experimental set-up would generate a current of 12.6 mA and a maximum output power of 9.7 mW, which would be sufficient to feed low-power portable electronic devices.58
Experimental section
General information
Reagents and solvents were bought from Apollo, Fluorochem, and Merck and used as received. PMMA (ALTUGLAS® BS 550) and index matching liquid 150 (IML150) were purchased from Arkema and Norland, respectively. Monocrystalline high efficiency silicon solar cells were provided by IXYS (IXOLAR SolarBIT KXOB22-12X1F, active area 2.2 × 0.6 cm2, VOC = 0.64 ± 0.01 V, JSC = 42.60 ± 0.42 mA cm−2, FF = 69.4 ± 0.3%, power conversion efficiency = 18.69 ± 0.23%). GC-MS spectra were collected on a Clarus 560 S PerkinElmer having an Elite-5MS 30.0 m × 250 μm column. Helium was used as carrier gas. NMR spectra were collected on a Bruker NMR Avance 400 NEO. Absorption spectra were collected on a Cary 60 UV-Vis Agilent spectrophotometer in a 10 mm path length quartz cuvette. Photoluminescence spectra were collected on a Cary Eclipse Fluorescence Agilent spectrophotometer in a 10 mm path length quartz cuvette. UV-visible absorption spectra of LSCs were recorded on a Thermo Scientific Evolution 600 UV-Vis spectrophotometer using wavelength scan with a resolution of 1 nm at a scan speed of 120 nm min−1 and a slit width of 2 nm. The steady-state photoluminescence spectra were recorded both in front-face and edge emission configurations were collected using a Jasco FP-6600 spectrofluorometer. The excitation wavelengths were 490, 506 and 434 nm for TT1, TT2 and TT3-based LSC systems, respectively. To evaluate the optical performance of the considered thin-film LSCs, the systems were illuminated with an Abet Technologies Sun 2000 solar simulator, equipped with an AM 1.5 filter and a condenser lens to modify the spectral output of the Xenon lamp to match the solar spectrum at a solar zenith angle of 48.2°. The output of the solar simulator was calibrated to 1 Sun (irradiance of 1000 ± 10 W m−2). In this configuration, the solar simulator illuminates the top face of the LSC, which is placed on a black absorbing background. The spectrally resolved optical power output at each edge of the LSC was collected with a spectroradiometer (International Light Technologies ILT950) equipped with a cosine corrector positioned at the center of the edge, while the other edges were covered with black tape. The optical power output spectra of the LSCs were recorded using SpectrILight III software. From these, the internal and external photon efficiencies were calculated. LSC device efficiency in the presence of edge-coupled c-Si solar cells was assessed using an Abet Technologies Sun 2000 solar simulator with AM1.5G filter and a Keithley 2612B source-measuring unit which allows performing of the voltage scans and measure the current output. I–V curves of the LSCs were recorded using LabView software and the data obtained were averaged out of at least three different devices.
Computational methods
Atomistic simulations of TTB derivatives have been carried out following a multi-level protocol. First, molecular rotamers have been sorted by using a semiempirical tight-binding approach, which has been also used in the case of TT1 dimer configurations; accurate optoelectronic properties were then calculated by using ab initio simulations. In the former case, the GFN2-xTB Hamiltonian59 was used as “engine” for the search of minimum energy configurations through an automated conformer-rotamer ensemble sampling tool (CREST).60,61 In the latter case, (time-dependent) density functional theory simulations were performed in a GTO framework by using the ORCA suite of programs.62,63 A more detailed description of computational methods has been enclosed in the ESI,† in order to ensure the full reproducibility of the calculations.
LSCs fabrication
Square-shaped LSCs of different sizes (5 × 5 × 0.6 cm3, 10 × 10 × 0.6 cm3 and 15 × 15 × 0.6 cm3) and rectangular-shaped LSCs with dimensions 20 × 5 × 0.6 cm3 were fabricated in thin film configuration (i.e., consisting of a slab of a high-optical-quality glass coated on one side with a host matrix/luminophore system). The substrates were made of a high-optical-quality glass (SCHOTT N-BK7).
A first analysis of the optical properties of TT1–3/PMMA-based LSCs as a function of the luminophore concentration was performed on devices with dimensions of 5 × 5 × 0.6 cm3. The devices were prepared starting from CHCl3 solutions of PMMA (10 wt%) with various concentrations of luminophore (expressed in wt% with respect to dry polymer). The TT1–3/PMMA films were obtained by spin coating (1000 rpm for 60 s) using a Laurell WS-400BZ-6NPP/LITE instrument. The average coatings thickness was measured by a KLA Tencor P-17 profilometer to be ∼3.5 μm.
On the basis of the findings of this preliminary investigation, large-area (10.0 × 10.0 × 0.6 cm3, 20.0 × 20.0 × 0.6 cm3 and 20 × 5 × 0.6 cm3) LSC devices with optimized luminophore concentration were fabricated using doctor-blade deposition technique. The PMMA powder was dissolved in a solvent mixture of 2:1 (v/v) chlorobenzene and chloroform to obtain a 6 wt% polymer solution. After 2 h magnetic stirring, the solution was deposited onto large-area glass plate via the doctor-blade technique.
For benchmarking purposes, we also fabricated and tested LR305-doped devices following the same procedures reported above. The LR305-based LSC devices were prepared varying LR305 concentration in the 1–10 wt% range with respect to dry polymer (PMMA).
To obtain LSC-PV systems, monocrystalline silicon solar cells connected in series were coupled to the LSC devices by means of IML150 low viscosity liquid monomer, so that two opposite edges of the glass substrates faced the photoactive area of two c-Si PV cells each.

Conclusions
We have applied a computationally aided de novo synthesis and design approach to develop a series of high Stokes shift derivatives featuring at the same time large spectral separation, high emission efficiency and exceptionally easy and green synthetic access. We have based our approach on the use of micellar catalysis as the key step in the tuning of the electronic structure of the new derivatives, employing a late-stage divergent functionalization strategy to connect molecular diversity with synthetic efficiency. All derivatives can be prepared efficiently, avoiding hazardous chemicals at all stages, and mostly relaying on water as the reaction medium. Amongst the 5 derivatives identified to be of potential interest as luminophores for LSCs, two performed particularly well (TT1 and TT3). We prepared thin film LSCs and carried out a detailed photophysical characterization, comparing the results with those obtained under similar experimental conditions with the standard in the field, the perylene dye LR305. The newly designed luminophores proved to be comparatively more performing, particularly for large area devices that are key for the development of building integrated photovoltaics. The new luminophores are fully characterized both in solution and as active components of small and large area LSCs, demonstrating performances exceeding those of Lumogen chromophores in the particularly sought-after field of large area devices. Such favourable spectral features, along with uniquely contained E-factors, make TT1 and TT3 derivatives particularly good candidates for scaled up industrial applications.
