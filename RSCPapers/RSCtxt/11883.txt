    , Accepted 18th March 2019First published on 20th March 2019AbstractSolar steam generation has attracted increasing attention due to its applications in water purification (e.g., desalination and wastewater treatment). Many strategies have been developed for achieving efficient photothermal conversion materials based on abundant biomass. However, it is challenging for most of these materials to simultaneously facilitate water transport and manage heat well, which results in unsatisfactory evaporation efficiencies under 1 sun illumination. Here, inspired by natural sugarcane stems' bi-functional structures—vascular bundles for mass transport and parenchyma cells for nutrition storage, we use surface-carbonized de-sugaring stems of sugarcane as efficient solar steam generators. The obtained materials have abundant “closed chambers” for thermal insulation (ca. 0.08 W m−1 K−1 in thermal conductivity) and bundles of vertical channels for water transport. These materials achieve an evaporation conversion efficiency up to 87.4% under 1 sun illumination without the usage of additional thermal insulators. This value surpasses all other biomass-derived materials ever reported. Because such bi-functional structures also widely exist in the stems of other Poaceae plants that are renewable and abundant in nature, this strategy is expected to open a new avenue for the future design and fabrication of diverse, more efficient, and cost-effective photothermal-conversion devices.
Introduction
Water scarcity is presently one of the most severe global challenges. A variety of advanced technologies for obtaining pure water, such as membrane treatment,1 advanced oxidation,2 and solar steam generation,3–13 have been extensively studied. Among them, solar-energy enabled steam generation is one of the most promising techniques because of the cleanness and abundance of solar energy.14 Generally, an efficient solar-steam-generation material requires three important features: (1) strong sunlight absorption ability; (2) excellent thermal management to minimize the heat loss to water or side environments; and (3) rapid water absorption/transport ability via optimized hydrophilic pore structures.
Over the past few years, many efforts have been devoted to the design and fabrication of materials with such attributes. For example, nanostructured noble metals (e.g. Au and Ag) are highly efficient solar absorption and conversion materials due to their localized surface plasmon resonance effects.5,9,15–18 But high cost hinders their applications. Taking all these factors into consideration, architectured carbon materials are very attractive alternatives. Beyond low materials cost, they usually exhibit excellent physical and chemical stabilities and strong light absorption abilities. Although carbon foam,3 graphene oxide aerogel,19 graphene oxide foam,20 graphene foam,21,22 and carbon nanotube composites,23etc., already show high photothermal conversion efficiencies, several key problems still exist in these artificially designed materials. Usually, fabricating elaborate porous structures for thermal management and water transport inevitably improves the cost and difficulties in large-scale production of these materials. In addition, most of these evaporators need environment-unfriendly polystyrene foam (ca. 0.04 W m−1 K−1 in thermal conductivity) as thermal insulators to enhance the conversion efficiency.24–26 This leads to additionally plastic pollution. On the contrary, natural plants possess abundant multi-level, hierarchical, and elaborate structures to facilitate both water absorption and transport in their whole systems. Hence, various plant structures have been used to develop solar steam generators via more friendly and much easier preparation strategies.8,26–28 For instance, Hu et al., demonstrated creatively that surface-carbonized (SC) wood can be used as solar steam generators with evaporation efficiencies up to 80.4% at 10 kW m−2 (ca. 10 sun). This originates from the wood's abundant channels for water transport and high light absorption on its carbonized surface.27 However, the thermal conductivity of a piece of natural wood along its growth direction is comparably high (ca. 0.34 W m−1 K−1). Its evaporation conversion efficiency at 1 kW m−2 (ca. 1 sun) was only 57.3% that is not high enough for practical applications.27 Although the thermal conductivity along the wood's transverse direction is much lower (ca. 0.11 W m−1 K−1) and the resulting evaporation efficiency was improved to 89% at 10 kW m−2, the water transport ability in this direction is low and the efficiency of 74% under 1 kW m−2 is still unsatisfactory.28 Therefore, a bi-functional bio-structure capable of both thermal management and efficient water transport is highly expected for solar steam generation.
Sugarcane is one of the main farm crops and its annual global production reached 1711.09 Tg in 2010.29 As a member of Family Poaceae (grasses), sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum) stem has two important structural parts. One is the so-called vascular bundles for water and sucrose transmission. These bundles are well distributed over the entire stalks. The other is the so-called parenchyma cells surrounding to the vascular bundles for nutrition (mainly sucrose here) storage.30,31 The volumetric ratio (ca. 80%)32 of the parenchyma cells in a sugarcane stem is usually much higher than in the wood stem that need not store sugar. If the sucrose is removed from the parenchyma cells, these air-filled cells that do not favor rapid water transport would serve as “closed chambers” at ambient temperatures and pressures. This can greatly reduce the heat convection and heat conduction. Hence, in a de-sugaring stem of sugarcane, its dense parenchyma-cell arrays could provide excellent thermal insulating properties, and well-distributed vascular bundles offer natural hydrophilic pathways for water transport. Based on this understanding, here we demonstrate that simply surface-carbonizing the sugarcane stems can generate high-performance materials for solar steam generation (Fig. 1a). The resultant materials exhibit excellent sunlight absorption, thermal insulation (ca. 0.08 W m−1 K−1), and directed water transport abilities. These attributes together give rise to an overall solar steam generation performance up to 87.4% at 1 kW m−2.

Experimental
Materials preparation
The skinned fresh sugarcane was cut into cylindrical slices along the growth direction. After freeze drying for 48 h, the top surfaces of sugarcane slices were heated with an alcohol lamp for 2 min to carbonize their surfaces. After that, we soaked the SC-sugarcane in purified water at 60 °C and ethyl alcohol for several times (each for 20 min) to remove the remaining sucrose and other impurities until the water was clear and colourless. Finally, surface-carbonized and cleaned sugarcane stems were obtained after drying at 60 °C for 24 h. The diameter of the SC-sugarcane stem was ca. 2.5 cm. The SC-wood (Basswood) was prepared through the same carbonization process as SC-sugarcane.
Characterizations
The microscopic morphologies of surface-carbonized sugarcane stems were collected using a field emission scanning electronic microscope (FESEM, Hitachi S-4800). The pore structures of samples were characterized with a mercury porosimeter (Micromeritics AutoPore IV 9500). UV-vis adsorption spectra were recorded on a UV/vis/NIR spectrometer (PerkinElmer, Lambda 750S). The absorption of the SC-sugarcane was calculated from A = 1 − R − T, where R and T are the reflection and transmission of the SC-sugarcane, respectively. The transmittance of the SC-sugarcane was set to zero. The optical microscope images were collected using a fluorescence polarizing microscope (ZEISS Axio Scope A1). The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was recorded with a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (IR/Nicolet 6700). An IR camera (FLIR T620) was employed to measure the temperature changes. Water contact angles were measured using a contact angle measuring device (JC2000, Shanghai Zhongchen, China). True density was measured using a gas pycnometer (Micromeritics AccuPyc 1330).
Thermal conductivity measurement
The thermal conductivity of the surface-carbonized sugarcane was measured and calculated using κ = ραC, where ρ is the volumetric mass density, which was calculated from the weight and volume; α is the thermal diffusivity, which was measured with a Netzsch LFA 447 Nano flash equipment, and C is the specific heat capacity, which was measured using a differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) equipment (Perkin Elmer DSC8000). The sample was 1 × 1 cm in size with its thickness thinner than 2 mm.
Solar vapor generation
The SC-sugarcane stems were placed in a test tube (50 mL, ca. 25 mm in diameter) with distilled water (45 mL) inside and then irradiated by a solar simulator (Newport 94023A, Class AAA) at 25 °C. The mass changes were real-time monitored using an electronic analytical scale (BSM-220.4). The dark-field evaporation rate of the systems was subtracted from the evaporation rate obtained under irradiation.
Results and discussion
Surface-carbonized sugarcane (SC-sugarcane) stems were prepared via three main steps. First, skinned sugarcane blocks of different lengths (10, 18, and 23 mm) were cut into cylindrical slices along their growth directions using a circular die (2.5 cm in diameter). Then, the samples were treated by a freeze-drying process to preserve their pore structures while simultaneously removing the sucrose (Fig. 1b and c). After that, the de-sugaring slices were heated on the flame of an alcohol lamp for 2 min to carbonize their surfaces to enhance the sunlight absorption (Fig. 1d). The thickness of the resulting carbonized layer on the surface was ca. 2 mm.
The bi-functional structure of the sugarcane stems has been optimized by natural selection for millions of years. In Fig. 2a, the top-view scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image shows a typically integrated arrangement of the vascular bundles and parenchyma cells—the former form centralized water conveyance units and the latter are densely distributed between these units. The vertical vascular bundles (Fig. 2b and e) that generally exist in plants are composed of sieve tubes (ca. 20 μm in diameter) for sugar transport and vessels (ca. 60 μm in diameter) for water transport, respectively.33,34 Interestingly, there are ca. 3–5 μm sized (long axis) elliptical holes distributed on the vessel walls (Fig. 2e). They enable the water diffusion and transport in the horizontal direction.33 In comparison, the parenchyma cells arrange continuously like a honeycomb structure with the diameters of single cells ranging from 50 to 200 μm (Fig. 2c). The light absorption (Fig. S1†) contrast between the SC-sugarcane and as-grounded samples implies that this honeycomb structure benefit efficient solar absorption by introducing multiple light scattering effects.35 The length of the parenchyma cells ranges from 200 to 400 μm (Fig. 2d and f). There is a small number of pores with the diameter of ca. 1.1 μm on the inner walls of the parenchyma cells (inset in the Fig. 2f). These on-wall pores provide paths for sucrose to diffuse between the bundles and parenchyma cells.36 However, the water transmission rate through these on-wall-pores is much lower than that in the vascular bundles (ca. 20–60 μm in diameter) due to the viscous forces.27,37 So the de-sugaring and air-filled parenchyma cells can serve as nearly “closed chambers” that effectively prevent water diffusing inside under ambient environment. To show such a prevention behavior, we applied a 0.1 mg mL−1 rhodamine B water solution for solar steam generation. The optical microscope images illustrate that the water cannot readily enter the parenchyma cells (Fig. S2†).

The pore structure of the SC-sugarcane was further characterized with a mercury porosimeter. Large pores (ca. 20–100 μm in diameter, Fig. S3†) are detected, which correspond to the sieve tubes and vessels (ca. 20–60 μm), respectively. The volumetric ratio of the open pores to closed pores is ca. 0.92:1 (Table S1, see details in ESI†). This value is higher than the volumetric ratio of vascular bundles to parenchyma cells because the mercury can penetrate the 1 μm-large pores on the parenchyma cell walls and get into the cell chambers driven by the imposed pressures during the measurements. However, the nearly 44.5 vol% of the closed pores still ensure the low thermal conductivity (ca. 0.08 W m−1 K−1, Table S2†) along the longitudinal direction of a dehydrated SC-sugarcane stem. This thermal conductivity increases to ca. 0.22 W m−1 K−1 after the SC-sugarcane was fully soaked in water for 1 h.
The light absorption of the natural sugarcane and SC-sugarcane was characterized using ultraviolet-visible-near-infrared absorption spectroscopy. As shown in Fig. 3a and S4,† the SC-sugarcane shows high light absorption (ca. 98.4%) in the ultraviolet and visible light regions (300–780 nm), and ca. 95.0% absorption in the near-infrared region (780–2500 nm). Weighted by the standard air mass 1.5 global (AM 1.5 G) solar spectrum,38 the SC-sugarcane achieves a high absorption of ca. 98.0% over the full wavelength range of 300–2500 nm. In contrast, the average integrated absorption of natural sugarcane in the ultraviolet and visible regions is only ca. 60%, and even lower (ca. 50%) in the near-infrared region. The functional groups of the bottom (without any treatment) and top surface (through carbonization) of the SC-sugarcane were identified with Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Both the bottom and top surfaces have rich C–H and O–H groups due to the existence of cellulose (Fig. 3b). However, compared to the bottom surface, the signal intensities of the C–H and O–H on the top surface decrease and the CO and C–O–C signals emerge. These variations indicate that oxidation occurs during the surface carbonation. Moreover, contact angle measurements (Fig. 3c) show a highly hydrophilic nature of the SC-sugarcane stems, which ensures a rapid water transport in these samples. To investigate the performance of SC-sugarcane as steam generators, we adopted 1–4 sun irradiation on a 1.8 cm-thick sample floating on water for 1 h (a discussion on the thickness optimization is provided in Fig. S5†). The temperature of the sample's top surface reaches 38.8, 58, 68.6, and 81.3 °C for 1–4 sun irradiation, respectively (Fig. 3d and S6†). Accordingly, the temperature of the bottom surface is 25.9, 33.3, 37.1, and 41.1 °C, respectively. Thus, the maximal temperature differences (ΔTs) between these two surfaces increase from 12.9 to 40.2 °C with the irradiation intensity (Fig. 3e). In comparison, there is no obvious temperature difference between the surface and the bulk of water under 1 sun irradiation (Fig. S7†). We further recorded the temperature evolution for the sample's top surface under 1 sun irradiation using infrared imaging (Fig. S8†). The surface temperature quickly increases from initial 21.3 to 29.6 °C in 1 min, demonstrating a strong ability of energy absorption-conversion-conservation of the SC-sugarcane.

(e) Temperature differences between the top surface of SC-sugarcane and the bulk water 2 cm below the top surface of SC-sugarcane. 
The evaporation rate and efficiency were calculated by measuring the mass changes of the water under 1–4 sun irradiation at 25.0 °C (Fig. S9†). The natural water evaporation rates without illumination are 0.128, 0.208, and 0.257 kg m−2 h−1 for water, a natural-sugarcane/water system, and the SC-sugarcane/water system, respectively (Fig. 4a). Under 1 sun irradiation, the mass loss rate of water for the SC-sugarcane/water system is 1.57 kg m−2 h−1. With the increase in the illumination intensity, the mass change increases and reaches 5.81 kg m−2 h−1 under 4 kW m−2 (Fig. 4b). After subtracting the evaporation rate in the dark field, we obtained the energy conversion efficiency (η) by η = ṁhLV/I(1)where ṁ is the mass flux of steam, hLV is the total enthalpy of liquid–vapor phase change, and I is the power density of solar illumination. Here, we use hLV = 2406 kJ kg−1 (40 °C) under 1 sun irradiation.25,28,39 For the SC-sugarcane system, the efficiency reaches 87.44% under 1 kW m−2 and 88.12% under 4 kW m−2, respectively (Fig. 4c). The efficiency under 1 sun illumination is much higher than the carbonized mushrooms (78%)26 and SC-wood (longitudinal, 74%),28 which is almost the highest performance in biomass based solar steam generation devices ever reported in the literature (Table 1). We also measured the performance of wood-based samples (Basswood) fabricated via the same process on the same test system. The results demonstrate the superior performance of SC-sugarcane (Fig. S10†). The stability of the solar steam generator was rated by cycling the measurements (1 h) four times under 1, 2, 3, 4 kW m−2, respectively (Fig. 4d). The maximum mass change between individual cycles under a certain illumination is ca. 8% (under 2 kW m−2).

To understand how water transports in the vascular bundles and parenchyma cells and the effect of the thermal insulation on the overall efficiency, we simulated the temperature distribution and water flowing in the sugarcane structure under 1 sun irradiation using a finite element method (FEM, see SI-1 in the ESI† for details). We adopted a 2D geometric model to simplify the calculation (Fig. S11†). The microstructural unit of the sugarcane was assumed to be 340 × 300 μm2. The vascular bundles contain two parts. One is the vessels (60 μm in diameter, dv) and the other is the sieve tubes (20 μm in diameter, dt) that surround the vessels and are connected by “holes” (4 μm in diameter, dp). Parenchyma cells (dc: 100 μm, h: 300 μm) surround the sieve tubes and are connected by “pores” (d: 1 μm). The thickness of the walls was set to be 2 μm.
We first calculated the Reynolds number to understand the water flow mode in the sugarcane (SI-1, ESI†). Due to the very small Reynolds number (ca. 2.45 × 10−5), the heat transfer is combined with a laminar flow model for fluid flow analysis. The simulation results for 1 unit show the temperature distribution (Fig. 5a and S12†). The temperature in the parenchyma cells is higher than in the vascular bundles, indicating the well thermal insulation of the parenchyma cells. The average water flow velocity on the top surface of the sugarcane was set to be 0.36 μm s−1. This value was obtained based on the experimental evaporation rate (SI-1, ESI†). The flow velocity distribution within one unit is shown in Fig. 5b and S9,† respectively. The flow velocity at Point 1 (Fig. 5b) in the vascular bundle is ca. 1.06 μm s−1, which is three orders of magnitude faster than that at Point 2 (ca. 1.14 × 10−3 μm s−1, Fig. 5b) in the parenchyma cell. The ultra-low velocity of the water flow in the parenchyma cells is consistent with the fact that water is difficult to enter the parenchyma cells. The de-sugaring parenchyma cells are thus filled with air and lead to low thermal conductivity.
 Fig. 5  Simulation of (a and c) temperature distribution and (b and d) flow velocity distribution in one sugarcane unit (340 × 300 μm2) and 60 units along the vertical direction, respectively (e) is the enlarged view of (d). The streamline length in (b), (d), and (e) denotes the relative flow velocity. The view scale of the x to z axis in (c–e) is 20:1. 
Additionally, we conducted the simulation with 60 structural units stacking along the vertical direction (1.8 cm in the total length) under 1 sun radiation as the distributions of the temperature and flow velocity do not change with the unit increase along the horizontal direction (Fig. S13 and S14†). The calculated temperature difference is 13.3 °C (Fig. 5c), close to our experimental data (ca. 12.9 °C). Simulation results also show that there are streamlines from the bottom to the top surface (Fig. 5d) but no obvious streamlines from the vascular bundle to the parenchyma cells (Fig. 5e), consistent with the previous results obtained in 1 unit. To demonstrate the throttling effect of the 1 μm-large pores on the parenchyma cell walls, we deliberately enlarged the pore size from 1 μm to 5 μm (Fig. S15†). The streamlines then appear in the parenchyma cells and the Point 2's flow velocity increases 40 folds from 1.14 × 10−3 to 4.8 × 10−2 μm s−1.
Conclusions
We demonstrated that the nature-engineered bi-functional structures of sugarcane significantly benefit solar steam generation. The evaporation rate and conversion efficiency reach 1.57 kg m−2 h−1 and 87.44% under 1 kW m−2, respectively, surpassing other biomass-derived generators ever reported to our knowledge. The excellent performance is attributed to the integrated structures that consist of abundant vascular bundles for water transport and the de-sugaring parenchyma cells as “closed chambers” for thermal insulation (ca. 0.08 W m−1 K−1). This strategy is comparably cost-effective and does not need any additional floaters for thermal insulation, thus is promising for achieving large-scale applications. Moreover, Poaceae plants have more than 12000 species.42 They have already evolved efficient water transport systems and most importantly, different parenchyma cells to store various nutrients including starch and sucrose. Hence, the strategy of “de-nutrient for closed chambers for thermal insulation” also provides inspiration for the design of bi-functional structures for even higher performance and scalable photothermal conversion devices at low cost.
