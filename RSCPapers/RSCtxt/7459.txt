    First published on 16th August 2019AbstractThe replacement of inorganic semiconductors with molecule-based compounds for applications in current-to-light conversion has led to a significant increase in interdisciplinary collaborations worldwide, affording new improved organic-light emitting diodes (OLEDs) ripe for commercial applications, as well as light-emitting electrochemical cells (LECs) that have recently started to head to the market. This review highlights the role that transition metal coordination complexes (TMCs) have played in advancing the field of molecular electronics, from early conception to the advanced development of several polypyridyl complexes currently pursued for both OLED and LEC concepts. In this context, the design and synthesis of Ir(III), Pt(II), Cu(I) and Ag(I) complexes as the emissive components of OLEDs and LECs are thoughtfully presented. We discuss how molecular design is pivotal for fine-tuning color and optimizing power efficiencies, highlighting the key roles of the metal, cyclometalate, and ancillary polypyridyl ligands. We provide insight into the strategies exploited for the development of new, improved emitters and their fabrication into OLEDs/LECs with high external quantum efficiencies and stabilities. In addition, we have surveyed the remarkable photophysical properties of third generation TMCs capable of undergoing thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF). Since previous reviews of TADF materials are strongly biased towards organic-based systems, this overview compliments other synopses of light emitting TADF materials. Finally, we shed light onto the conceptual challenges that still need to be overcome to advance the rational design of TMC-based TADF emitters with tunable ligands and the subsequent fabrication of OLEDs/LECs, which are tailor-made for each specific application.

1 Introduction to artificial lighting: motivation and importance
At the turn on the 20th century, one of the major scientific breakthroughs that has impacted the everyday lives of humans on a global scale was the discovery of solid-state lighting (SSL). In this respect, SSL is based on the concept of electroluminescence, where light is produced by the radiative deactivation of excitons generated as a result of efficient electron–hole recombination in the bulk of a semiconducting material (see Sections 1.1 and 1.2).1–15 Underpinning this technology are thin-film and multi-layered electroluminescent devices comprising of either organic and/or inorganic semiconducting materials.1 At an applied bias, both holes and electrons are injected and transported through the bulk and eventually recombine forming an exciton that relaxes radiatively, yielding visible light. Hence, in contrast to traditional lighting devices where light is a byproduct, SSL allows for significantly reduced heat generation, as well as enhanced luminous efficiency. In addition, SSL provides excellent stability, brightness and light point sources of different colors.2,3 Traditionally, SSL technology is divided into light-emitting diodes (LEDs), organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), and light-emitting electrochemical cells (LECs), Fig. 1. Light-emitting diodes are small point sources made of a thin-film of inorganic semiconductors combining several elements that include indium, gallium, phosphorous and nitrogen, as well as color converters.1,4,5

Color convertors include the so-called inorganic phosphors doped with rare-earth metals like cerium, yttrium, or organic down-converters. In the case of the latter, organic/inorganic materials have been developed which are more commonly referred to as hybrid LEDs.6 Owing to their high luminous efficiency and stability, LEDs are now routinely implemented for screen backlighting, and home illumination, automotive, traffic signaling, advertising as well as merely decorative applications.1,9 In fact, the worldwide cost of artificial lighting for the aforementioned applications is currently estimated to be over 100 billion €, which is expected to increase by a further 30% in 2020.17–19 Although only 0.1% of the worlds lighting is currently supplied by SSL the rapid development of this technology has led to an exponential growth that over the next few years will result in a larger share of the market place, as traditional lighting sources, such as compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs) and incandescent light bulbs are slowly phased out.16 In this respect, the market for SSL has seen a 40-fold increase in installed lamps, since their debut in 2001,20 which contributes to more than 2.8 billion USD in energy savings.21 Thanks to the high efficiency and luminescent properties already achieved in LEDs, the subsequent increase in their stabilities now promises exciting opportunities with respect to the future globalization of this technology. The DOE states that by 2025, LEDs will produce at least half of the electric light in the US and even more globally.22 In 2016, the Centre for Industrial Studies (CSIL) estimated that the worldwide consumption of LED lighting fixtures was worth 41.8 billion USD, encompassing almost 47% of the world total consumption, corresponding to a growth of 20%.23 In this respect, LED lighting fixtures contributed to just 5–6% of the total lighting fixtures market in 2008–2009, yet this share is forecasted to grow by up to 67% in 2021.23 This change is largely attributed to the significant increase in luminous efficiencies which are expected to reach 150–180 lm W−1 by 2020, considerably outperforming all mainstream conventional lamp technologies (Fig. 2).21

What could be more desirable for commercial applications than a significant increase in luminous lifetime of up to 20000 h, with a lumen maintenance value >90%, which in the longer term has the potential to reach at least 50000 h? Furthermore, current CFLs contain an average of 5 mg of mercury per bulb. This is an environmental concern and leads us to conclude that SSL, not only offers increased power efficiency, but is also attractive for the replacement of older, less ‘green’ sources of lighting.20 Despite these advantages, current LEDs suffer from several constraints which include the blue hazard, light quality, temperature dependence, blue pollution, voltage sensitivity, high price and as point light sources they are difficult to use for applications that require a spherical field. In addition, such significant market growth requires careful consideration of the materials and resources used, as well as how they are interlinked, since the overall design of the product significantly influences the fate of the components at its end-of-use, or end-of-lifetime. In this context, OLEDs and LECs (Fig. 3) are emerging as interesting alternatives to LEDs, since organic semiconductors like small molecules, polymers and/or coordination complexes are responsible for carrier injection, carrier transport and emission. Despite the fact that both LECs and OLEDs are less mature than LEDs, they offer complementary technology that is particularly attractive for stylistic and large area applications, as well as for enhanced color quality (see Section 1.4).10 While efficient OLEDs comprise of multilayered architectures prepared via chemical vapor deposition and rigorous encapsulation,10 LECs consist of single- or double-layered devices fabricated using solvent-based, up-scalable techniques.11 Even though OLEDs are currently used as displays in small handheld applications and prototype TVs, high manufacturing costs have limited their dissemination into the lighting market. As an alternative, LECs offer the easy fabrication of moderately performing devices based on 3D shaped substrates that include kitchen forks,12 wearable fibers13 and light-emitting paper.14 Additionally, a record efficiency of 99.2 cd A−1 has now been reported, paving the way forward for practical applications.15
 Fig. 3  LED lamps require less power than older light sources for emitting light. Efficiency is also referred to as luminous flux (measured in lumen) per unit added power (measured in W). Approximately one quarter of the world's electricity consumption is used for lighting applications; highly energy-efficient LED lamps contribute to the energy conservation of the Earth's resources.

Common to both concepts, the synthetic versatility of polypyridyl ligands renders them attractive for the development of luminescent transition metal complexes (TMCs) for applications as the emissive components of both OLEDs and LECs. In the following chapters we provide an overview of all of the families of polypyridyl complexes designed and optimized within the paradigm of SSL, highlighting the most suitable device structures, as well as the best emissive complexes reported to-date.
1.1 Historical evolution of artificial lighting
In contrast to the 20th century, where light came from incandescent light bulbs, most artificial light in the 21st century will arise from the emission of LEDs. This prediction was made when the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences awarded the 2014 Nobel Prize for Physics to three scientists acknowledged for the invention of efficient white LEDs. By extending cheap and affordable lighting sources,24 LEDs have the potential to improve the quality of human life on a global scale. For example, about 1.5 billion people in the world do not currently have access to electricity grids, a problem that could be solved via the large-scale commercialization of LEDs. As shown in Fig. 3, LEDs operate more efficiently than all other lighting sources, reaching 300 lm W−1, when compared to just 70 lm W−1 for their fluorescence counterparts. Although the most well-known applications of LEDs are light bulbs, other uses have included the removal of pollutants from water and air.25 Improvements in the robustness of LEDs are evidenced by the exponential relationship between the durability of an incident light bulb, florescent lamp and LED namely at, 103, 104, and 105 h, respectively. This is one of the key factors that has contributed to the large-scale commercialization of LEDs, which have now flooded the market as the microelectronic components of displays for smart televisions, computers, laptops, mobile phones and cameras. In fact, many homes and vehicles around the world now contain LED technology.2,3,10,11,14,15
The events that have led to the discovery of LEDs can be traced back to limelight or Drummond light, the stage lighting first used in old fashioned theatres and music halls. Limelight, produced by placing an oxyhydrogen flame inside a cylinder of calcium oxide or quicklime, is now recognized as being the first form of solid-state non-electrical lighting. It was first discovered by Drummond in 1826 and its bright whiteness is recognizable for a distance of up to 68 miles.26 Remarkably, this phenomenon precedes the first incident filament lamp discovered by Thomas Edison and Joseph Swan in 1879. However, Edison's filament lamps were preferred since they produced light without any unpleasant smells or smoke. In this respect, Edison constructed the first metal filaments from carbonized paper which he later replaced by fibers fabricated from Japanese bamboo. The discovery of the aforementioned light sources was soon followed by the observation of low-pressure discharge in gases, a discovery attributed to Peter Cooper Hewitt, the first inventor of colored light, originating from a mercury vapor lamp in 1901.27 A notable development in the broadening of the emission spectrum of these lamps then came about due to the parallel discovery of high-pressure gas-discharge. This phenomenon subsequently led to the discovery of the first low pressure metal vapor lamps that contained sodium metal, which like mercury also produce a visible glow. Although the patent for Hewitt's initial invention was purchased by General Electric in 1914, the first commercial low-pressure mercury and fluorescent lamps were not produced until the 1930's by rival, Westinghouse Electric Corporation.28 The emission in these lamps originates from phosphors coated onto the inner walls of a glass tube that affords a low-pressure discharge when irradiated with trace amounts of mercury vapor at low pressure, that causes the lamp to glow.29,30 In recent years, the discovery and study of solid-state inorganic and organic LEDs has rapidly accelerated their commercial applications, rendering them now smarter, lower cost and more environmentally friendly alternatives to traditional incandescent lights. Despite these advantages, one of the most important goals in this field is to tune their emissive properties, to achieve color temperatures (CT) no higher than 3000 K. In this respect, a higher CT rating generally means an increase in blue emission. The discovery of strong and stable blue emitters for OLEDs remains a challenge that has provided significant momentum for the intense research activity in this field over the past decade. In addition, prolonged exposure to blue light can harm vision by damaging the retina of the eye and blue light can also suppress the secretion of melatonin that in turn disturbs circadian rhythm. However, if the aforementioned constraints can be overcome, optimizing performance and reliability issues, then the outlook for these materials, well beyond 2019, should be very “bright”.
Semiconductor LEDs are currently the major components of small indicators that are typically found in games consoles, remote controls, as well as the interior lighting of cars. More importantly, they have been identified as key components for the fabrication of new generations of lighting and display technologies.
Electroluminescence was first discovered by Round in 1907, however Losev is accredited with the discovery of the first LED.32 In 1927 he patented a “light relay”, the first reference to LED-based optical communications, when he discovered that silicon zinc oxide and silicon carbide crystal diodes emit light when electrical currents are passed through them.33 Losev proposed that the nature of this emission is non-thermal and attributed it to the diode action of the LED. In 1929, he stated in a patent that LEDs could be used as detectors in optical relays for telegraphic and telephone communications, and as such is recognized as the first person to realize the true potential of LEDs for the advancement of telecommunications.34 The first practical visible spectrum LED comprising of gallium arsenide phosphide (GaAsP) was discovered by Nick Holonyak, Jr. in the early 1960's, who subsequently employed this red LED into numeric and alphanumeric displays, as well as indicator lights.35 For his singular impact on the progress of semiconductor LED technology, he is recognized as “the father of the LED”. Following Holonyak's pioneering work, research progress in this field rapidly accelerated, leading to the discovery of hundreds of subsequent emitters for LEDs.
Briefly, SSL based on organic materials was established in 1953 requiring very high voltages to observe emission of light from a crystalline sample.36 In 1987 Tang and Van Slyke reported the first OLED with a sandwich-like architecture, a few hundreds of nanometers in thickness, using emissive and injection layers prepared by physical vapor deposition.37 The charge injection and electron–hole recombination processes at the interface of the bilayer were decoupled, achieving luminous efficiencies of ca. 1.5 lm W−1 at only 10 V. In 1990, Burroughes et al. achieved another breakthrough by preparing sandwich-like OLEDs using solvent-based deposition techniques with conjugated polymers.38 Low external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of 0.05% at an applied bias of 14 V were obtained due to the low electron–hole recombination rate caused by the selection of electrodes and the lack of charge injection/blocking layers. Tang and Van Slyke subsequently enhanced the electroluminescence efficiency by employing a multi-layered device architecture with several layers devoted solely to charge injection, charge transport, and charge recombination processes.39–41 Advances in device design were accompanied by the development of new phosphorescent materials that include TMCs,42 as well as the realization of light out-coupling architectures that have subsequently enhanced device efficiencies.43,44 Today, OLEDs still suffer from several shortcomings that include: (i) the use of air-unstable electrodes; (ii) multi-layered architectures to reach high efficiencies; (iii) the fabrication in dust-free environments; (iv) device encapsulation to avoid O2 and moisture and (v) low fabrication success of 3D shaped substrates.
In parallel to the multi-layered approach followed in OLEDs, Pei and co-workers proposed the use of conjugated polymer emitters together with mobile ions that can assist with charge injection and electrochemical doping (p and n zones) in single layer devices.45 The resulting devices feature low turn-on voltages (2.0–3.0 V), reaching 200 cd m−2 and EQEs of up to 2%.45 This family of thin-film SSL devices represent early examples of LEC technology. In these devices, the active layer is a blend of an emitter (conjugated polymer, TMC, small molecules, QDs, etc.) with a reversible electrochemistry and high photoluminescence quantum yields in thin films, that is blended with an ionic electrolyte (ion-doped polyethylene oxide or ionic liquid). Upon applying a bias, the ions are polarized by the external electric field, allowing charge injection from air-stable electrodes. The charge injection is further stabilized by the ions leading to three well-defined zones: p-, n- and a neutral or intrinsic zone from which the light is emitted. In fact, LECs show interesting electrical features that include (i) bipolar behavior with a rectification ratio near unity; (ii) full tolerance compared to the thickness of the active layer and (iii) a fairly high tolerance to the type of air-stable electrodes employed.
One year after the first reported LEC, Lee and co-workers demonstrated LECs comprising of cationic Ru(II) complexes.46 Furthermore, in 2004, Slinker and co-workers advanced the field of LECs further by successfully employing ionic Ir(III) complexes.47 This seminal work has led to the discovery of interesting, state-of-the-art TMCs, employed in devices which present stabilities of thousands of hours, as well as high luminance and efficiency levels that are comprehensively summarized in this review. Despite the type of emitter, the best performing LECs still emit in the yellow region. In fact, red LECs show low efficiencies that are limited by the poor photoluminescence features of this class of emitters. Furthermore, blue LECs possess low stabilities caused by the degradation of the emitter due to the charge injection process and/or a population of degradative excited states upon electron–hole recombination that include the triplet metal centered states (MC) in Ir(III) complexes. Finally, the quality of the active layer morphology is the key to providing homogeneous doped regions which strongly depend on the nature of the emitter/electrolyte, deposition techniques and electrodes employed. These limitations led to the discovery of the first LECs based on Cu(I) complexes in 2005,48 which have attracted enormous interest over the past 5 years.49–54 In parallel, small molecules have been applied mainly to develop red LECs55–59 and thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) LECs.60,61 Finally, a few QDs and/or NPs as emitters for LECs have also been reported.62,63 Nevertheless, there is still plenty of scope to enhance device performance by optimizing the electrolyte for the different emitters, as well as device architectures and driving conditions.11,64
1.2 The mechanism of OLEDs and LECs
As previously mentioned, all LED architectures comprise at least three main layers: an n-type that contains a surplus of negative charges, a p-type having an insufficient number of electrons and a third active, or emissive layer sandwiched in between. In such systems, when an electric voltage is applied, the resulting electrons move from the negative n-type to the positive p-type layers and radiative recombination together with the holes leads to light emission. For both direct and indirect band gap semiconductors, the color of the emitted light depends on the band gap, defined as energy difference between the valence and conduction bands. Increasing the mole fraction of the lighter elements in the composition of semiconductor LEDs results in a larger band gap, affording emitted photons with higher energies. The increase in efficiency coupled with a decrease in power savings for LEDs, when compared to more traditional light sources, is highlighted in Fig. 4.65 It is apparent that replacing older light sources with LED technology will significantly reduce energy consumption, which in turn makes these materials more eco-friendly and cost effective, Table 1.

As previously highlighted, the basic working mode of an OLED is based on the concept of electroluminescence. To realize their full commercial promise, the correct balance between the density and mobility of the charge carriers coupled with a good match between the energies of the HOMO and LUMO frontier orbitals of the emissive layers, holes, and electron transport layers must be achieved.67 The crucial components of an OLED device are highlighted in Fig. 11, in which HTL and ETL are the hole and transport layers and HIL and EIL are the hole and electron injector layers respectively.68 The efficiency of an OLED is measured in terms of figures of merit (FOM), which are influenced by a number of factors that include the composition of the electrodes, chemical composition of the emissive material, hole and transport layers, the class of polymer host, purity of the emissive compound, thickness of the transport layers, as well as the degree of air contamination.
In contrast, LECs operate via a different mechanism due to the presence of small ions within their active layers. Pei and others proposed an electrochemical device mechanism reaching a p–i–n structure, in which if a large applied voltage is applied, an electrochemical doping takes place at the electrode interfaces, leading to the formation of conductive p- and n-doped regions flanking an insulating neutral region (i);45,69,70Fig. 5. While the ions stabilize the growing of the doped regions, the electron–hole recombination occurs in the neutral region. In 2005, Leger and co-workers noted that either p- or n-doped regions can be formed depending on the applied bias and the injection energy barriers.71,72 This was followed by the electrodynamic model proposed by deMello and Malliaras.73–75 This model predicts slow formation of electric double layers (EDLs) at the electrodes due to the drift of the mobile ions, leading to a strong interfacial electric field that assists charge injection. In 2010, Ginger and Kemerink explain that this model depends on the nature of the carrier injection and/or the formation of ohmic contacts.76,77 To summarize, poor carrier injection leads to the electrodynamic model where there is poor electrochemical doping due to the high injection barrier, but it is continuously enhanced over time due to the EDL formation. Thus, both or only one of the doped fronts are rapidly formed if the ohmic contacts are achieved at the applied bias, leading to an electrochemical regime.

1.3 Commercial promise of OLEDs and LECs
The quest for next-generation LEDs based on newly engineered molecules that work more efficiently and are less costly than their semiconductor counterparts, led to the realization of organic light emitting materials or OLEDs.78–81 Instead of rigid semiconductor materials, the emissive layer of OLEDs is comprised of polymers or small molecules that can be deposited directly from solution or imbedded into a polymer matrix onto a range of substrates such as glass, flexible soft plastics, ceramics, metals and clothing.26 Consequently, OLEDs can be molded into a particular shape or design, permitting the fabrication of a broad range of flexible, lightweight devices. Although OLED technology currently suffers from high manufacturing costs, cheaper forms of OLED lighting and the development of flexible OLED based form factors for hardware design are on the horizon. Furthermore, the flexibility of OLED lighting panels will provide new opportunities for the installation of designer lighting, where aesthetics is the primary consideration. Scientists are currently working on embedding this technology into car windshields, store windows, and mirrors (http://OLED-Info.com). Furthermore, companies are now designing smart clothes with chips that can be connected to OLED-based processors. In this way walls, glasses, and mirrors can advertise products that users have ‘liked’ on their Facebook pages or added to their Amazon ‘wish lists’. Samsung commercialized the world's first 55 inch OLED smart television in 2012. The television was recognized as a “Best of Innovation Awards Honoree” at the 2012 Consumer Electronics Trade Event (CES) for its fast response time, ability to view two channels on the same screen and three-dimensional (3D) glasses with appended ear phones.82 In the future, it is very likely that both residential and commercial buildings will be decorated with OLED ceiling and/or wall panels. Fig. 6 shows a windowless plane covered with OLED panels.
 Fig. 6  A windowless aeroplane fabricated by OLEDs which could be a reality in under a decade. Reproduced from ref. 83 with permission from the http://Independent.Co.Uk, copyright 2014. 
An article published in the UK's independent newspaper in 2014 displays the concept of a windowless plane. It states: “those minuscule windows on airplanes could soon become a thing of the past, with a UK developer working on windowless fuselages that house giant, flexible OLED screens”.83
As previously mentioned, the fabrication of OLEDs is currently expensive84,85 primarily due to the multilayer evaporation process, and the need for technological encapsulation which is necessary to preserve opto-electronic properties86,87 and lifetimes.88,89 Nevertheless, when compared to semiconductor LEDs, the direct correlation between molecular structure and emission wavelength permits fine tuning of the optical properties that in turn offers a broad range of color options, including the red, blue, green and white needed for display applications.67 A comprehensive summary of these factors can be found in Section 1.4 of this review.
Over the past two decades, LECs have emerged as attractive prospects for next-generation SSL.90–93 As explained above, the simplicity of their device structures and fabrication makes them very attractive for low-cost SSL technology. However, LECs perform typically less well than OLEDs with respect to lifetime, luminance, and efficiency, see Tables 2–11. This lower performance is attributed to the electrochemical degradation of the emitter, the lack of control of the position of the emissive neutral layer, as well as phase separation between the emitter and the electrolyte over time, under both storage and working conditions. However, the best performing LECs possess record efficiencies of 99.2 cd A−1 at a luminance of ca. 2000 cd m−2 together with stabilities of thousands of hours.94–96 This is only noted for yellow and orange LECs using the archetypal emitters that include conjugated polymers and Ir(III) complexes. However, this excellent performance must be also achieved in blue, orange and red LECs, regardless of the type of emissive material employed (small molecule, sustainable TMCs, QDs, etc.).

The main advantage that has fueled commercial interest in LECs is the facile fabrication of the devices using any 3D conductive substrates and very cheap solvent-based fabrication techniques such as roll-to-roll and spray-coating, Fig. 7.12,97–100 Here, it is important to note that changes in the nature of the electrolyte strongly affect the quality of the active layer (rheological aspects for film forming, morphology, phase separation, etc.), but this has permitted their fabrication into a broad range of shapes and substrates that include fibers for lighting clothing, light-emitting paper as well as kitchen utensils such as forks. Therefore, while current industrial research on OLEDs is driven by their high efficiency, color quality, and high contrast, the niche for LECs involves lighting uses for labeling, signaling, decoration and medical applications. This is in part driven by the low-cost associated with the fabrication of LECs. Edman and co-workers recently investigated the financial costs associated with different scenarios for LEC mass production by varying fabrication techniques and environments.101 Surprisingly, they concluded that the achievement of high performing LECs prepared by high-volume roll-to-roll coating procedures costs 0.0036 € per lm, which is orders of magnitude less than OLEDs.101 When this low cost is combined together with additional advantages such as areal emission, low weight, low working voltage, and tolerance to ambient working conditions it seems very likely that LEC technology will find its way into our daily life within the next few years.64 To-date just a few companies have recognized this potential and started to develop LECs for commercial applications.

1.4 A bright future for OLED technology
Over the past decade, OLED technology has been integrated into lighting devices which offer high resolution and bright energy-saving displays that do not need a backlight. Consequently, OLED devices are much thinner and lighter than their LCD or plasma counterparts and as such, are beginning to be widely implemented into the screens of portable devices and smart televisions.82 Recent advances in OLED applications are reflected in the substantial increase in revenue reported by Samsung Electronics, i.e., 52 billion US dollars in the second quarter of 2018, which is substantially larger than the 13.3 billion dollars reported for the first quarter of 2017.102 More than two-thirds of current TV screens larger than 40 inches contain OLED technology. For this application, there is currently competition between OLEDs and the rival quantum dot technology (QD-LEDs), which is also being pursued by the leading electronic companies. Currently, the higher price of QD-LEDs compared to OLEDs, is not compensated by the small gain in their overall performance and thus a financial barrier remains towards the broad scale applications of this competing technology. Academic researchers and corporate laboratories worldwide are extensively focused towards finding new market-place opportunities for OLED devices. In this respect, the leading manufacturer of OLED displays is currently Samsung, which uses this technology in its Galaxy smartphones. Although, OLED televisions represent the largest applications for these materials to-date, mobile phones are likely to supersede this. The future growth of OLEDs will provide new opportunities for chemists to supply new families of compounds to the optoelectronics industry that could potentially involve research budgets of billions of dollars, Fig. 8.

The company IDTechEx forecasts that the global sales of OLED displays will reach 42 billion US dollars in 2020. Guillaume Chansin, senior technology analyst at IDTechEx, stated “OLED displays can be lighter, they can be flexible, and they allow designers more scope with respect to engineering the shape of their devices (Fig. 9).” Despite these advantages, rival technology such as liquid-crystal displays (LCDs) still retains a significant portion of the market. Current LCD technology is based on the generation of backlight that is sent light through liquid crystals, polarizers, color filters, and several image-enhancing filters. OLED technology requires no such backlight as the image is created from independent red, blue and green sub-pixels.

From an operational perspective, developing suitable blue OLEDs is challenging since fewer organic compounds and small molecules demonstrate blue emission. Furthermore, the chemical bonds in blue emitters are typically more sensitive to cleavage since OLEDs require more power to operate. The recombination process of the charge carriers mediated through the absorption of UV light is also more likely in blue compounds. For all electronic devices, the cost of the individual components is an important consideration. A large portion of OLEDs comprising of metal complexes contain iridium, which despite being amongst the earliest emissive materials affords displays that are expensive to manufacture at nearly $19 per g.
The next challenge concerns the vacuum deposition of the organic compounds and electrodes that typically requires harsh conditions i.e., 10−6 atm of pressure. During this process, in addition to the desired substrate, the emissive materials are also coated onto a mask which wastes between 70–90% of the compounds that must be subsequently removed. However, since only 1 g of this material is required for the fabrication of 3000 displays, this cost is unlikely to significantly affect the future growth of the OLED display market. As previously mentioned, almost all of the large electronic companies have heavily invested in OLED technology, including LG who invested $9 billion in November 2016 for the construction of an OLED TV plant. Compared to the future manufacturing of OLEDs, ink-jet printing should decrease fabrication costs and improve the overall performance of the displays, (Fig. 10). To date, DuPont's ink-jet inks are affording blue OLEDs that can perform at 95% after 2000 hours of continuous use.103 Despite these advances, the rate of progress of OLEDs for use in mobile phones has been much faster than TV displays. Since OLED displays are thinner, lighter, more flexible and robust than their LCD counterparts, it is generally believed that if their fabrication costs can be reduced then the whole display industry will ultimately shift to OLED technology in the near future. From an academic perspective, there has been an exponential growth of interest in the field of OLEDs in recent years as highlighted in Fig. 11. In fact, in a recent literature search, a total of 27229 articles including 1207 reviews were found with the title of “Organic Light Emitting Diode”. This highlights the global importance of this research field that includes significant contributions both from academia and industry. Several reviews highlighting the most important concepts relating to OLED and LEC performance have been published in recent years.104–107 There are also valuable reviews concerning the application of organometallic complexes in optoelectronic devices that include solar cell, OLED, water splinting and hydrogen production.108 Moreover, there have been several comprehensive reviews published on solid state LEDs based on ionic transition metal complexes (iTMCs) including Ir(III) complexes,11,109–111 however none have correlated the influence of the ancillary ligand in the transition metal emitter with the electroluminescence performance of the resulting complex in a solid state LED. In fact, review articles to-date discuss the main factors concerning device performance, modification of the components within each layer of the device, as well as device fabrication and encapsulation methodologies.112,113 In this review, we focus on the discovery, optimization and importance of TADF in polypyridyl transition metal complexes. The motivation behind this review stems from the urgent need for the rational design of TADF emitters to enhance their efficiencies and decrease processing costs for commercial applications.

1.5 Selection criteria for organometallic emitters
Among all of the emitters reported to-date, cyclometalate complexes have attracted considerable interest for their novel photophysical properties that are well suited to a broad range of applications.114–118 Since the first discovery of highly efficient OLEDs prepared from cyclometalate Ir(III) complexes, hundreds of organometallic compounds have now been reported.119,120 Cyclometalate complexes have the general formula [M(X)3−n(Y)n]x+ and are comprised of a metal cation (Mx+), a bidentate chelating ligand involved in at least one organometallic carbon-to-metal bond, as well as an ancillary ligand, see Fig. 12.
 Fig. 12  Three generations of OLEDs. The first organic and inorganic materials with high EQEs. The EQE values of I, II and III are taken from ref. 121, 122 and 123, respectively. 
The metal center is generally a cation with a full tn2g configuration e.g. Ir(III), Ru(II), Os(II), or Pt(II). In these complexes, the redox properties of the metal cations facilitate electron transport between the layers of the device. An Ir(III) complex comprising of the benchmark ligand bis[2-(4,6-fluorophenyl)pyridinato-C2,N] is shown in Fig. 13. The ancillary ligand (Y) can be mono- or multidentate, that is typically chosen to modulate the HOMO of complex.124,125 One major advantage of this family of compounds lies in their emissive properties that span a broad range of wavelengths. This makes them particularly well-suited as the emissive components of SSL point sources and display applications.126 The key role of the ancillary ligand is to tune the opto-electronic properties of the TMC, which is also important for dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) applications.127 In this respect, the up-conversion of photoluminescent compounds, which are able to produce near infrared emission is also promising for the development of light-emitting devices for solar cell applications.128–137 Furthermore, studies over the past few decades have revealed that it is the ancillary ligands of cyclometalate complexes that influence the key properties of the resulting OLED devices, which include luminescence intensity, stability, time to achieve maximum emission (Tmax), maximum emission wavelength or color, and tuning of the energy band gap. In this context, ligand substitution reactions to replace the aforementioned N,N′ ancillary ligands by N,N′, N,O, and O,O′ bidentate donors have been carried out to achieve better matches between the emissive and hole/electron transport properties. Tuning the structural and physical properties of the ligands by extending the π-conjugation and introducing electron donating/accepting groups have also been reported to modulate the color of the light emission and improve OLED performance.138–141 A more in depth discussion of this strategy applied to different families of emissive complexes is presented in Sections 2–6 of this review.

The archetypal emitter for electroluminescence devices is bis[2-(4,6-difluorophenyl)pyridinato-C2,N](picolinato)Ir(III) (Fig. 8), more commonly referred to as FIrpic or Ir(diFppy)2(pic). This complex is the most well studied cyclometalate Ir complex reported to-date and is widely used as a blue phosphorescent material. FIrpic is ideal for OLED applications since in addition to its suitable photophysical and electrochemical properties, it is straightforward to synthesize and it is stable and easy to structurally modify.142
1.6 Challenges and limitations in the market-place
Concerning the discussion regarding the commercialization and global marketplace opportunities for OLED and LEC devices, appropriate parameters (i.e., figures of merit – FoM) to compare the emission efficiencies of different compounds are necessary. In this respect, two of most the useful parameters to evaluate the emission efficiency are luminance (cd m−2), which conveys the amount of light emitted from a given area of a device and radiant power or flux (lm), which is defined as the radiant energy emitted. Luminance divided by the current density (A m−2) gives the current efficiency (cd A−1). It is important to note that device efficiency cannot be evaluated directly from the photometric parameters because it is not possible to directly convert cd and lm into physical units. In order to overcome this problem, EQE or ηφ, and power efficiency (PE) are more commonly used to relay device physics. In this respect, ηφ is related to the number of photons emitted from the surface of the device per number of injected charges and provides a measurement of the overall efficiency of the device, which is typically reported as a percentage. In contrast, PE defines the total radiation power from a unit area of an emission surface per second divided by the electric power density supplied to the device and is reported in units of lm W−1. In terms of efficiency, OLEDs can compete with highly efficient conventional light sources, but their efficiencies typically diminish at high brightness levels, an effect known as efficiency roll-off. The origin of efficiency roll-off is generally attributed to a decline in the charge-carrier balance and non-radiative quenching. This is particularly critical in LECs, in which parameters such as microcavity effects, self-absorption from the doped regions and electrode quenching must be taken into account in designing both the emitter and the device architecture. Therefore, LECs are still less competitive in terms of efficiency when directly compared to OLEDs and LEDs. It should also be noted that all the aforementioned parameters are routinely used to evaluate device efficiency. In this review, we will therefore use these FoM to highlight the performance of devices and assess the progress of device efficiency as a function of molecular design.143
In the next section, we will discuss the major factors that govern the emission efficiencies including: (1) the quantum efficiency of luminescence; (2) charge carrier balance factor; (3) out-coupling factor and (4) the lowering of drive voltage. It is important to note, that the main problem concerning the quantum efficiencies of the luminescence in these compounds was initially based on the assumption that the ratio of singlet to triplet excited states produced by carrier recombination could not theoretically exceed 25%. This number is attributed to the upper limit imposed on the system by the 3:1 statistics of the electron spin states formed under electrical excitation, since light can only be produced from singlet excitons. This means that if the recombination process is independent of spin, a limitation will always be encountered when compared to the luminescence efficiency of OLEDs, which is defined by the fact that the internal quantum efficiency (ηint) cannot exceed 25%. In practice, however, this limitation has now been overcome, for example Ir coordination complexes have been reported with ηint = 100% and non Ir-based systems are also known with ηint values close to 100%. In these systems, singlet excited states are generated through triplet–triplet annihilation (TTA), or a process more commonly referred to as TADF.144–149
Charge balance factors are more relevant to third generation emitters that significantly influence the device efficiency.150 However, more experimental and theoretical studies are required to acquire a better understanding of these factors. Recently, theoretical studies of OLEDs have shed light on the basic concept of carrier balance relating to the electron and hole recombination efficiency within the organic layer of the device.151 It is also important however to establish if carrier recombination zones are also present throughout the multiple layers of the device, including the doped regions in the LECs.
The light out-coupling factor χ is defined by eqn (1): (1)For refractive indices, n > 1.6 the right-hand side of the equation simplifies to (2n2)−1. For organic compounds with refractive indices close to 1.6, the value of χ is around 0.20. This conveys the fact that ∼50% of the phonons in the device are lost due to total internal reflection (TIR) and a further 30% are lost through the glass substrate and/or the ITO/organic layers, i.e., they are either trapped inside the substrate, or emitted out from the edges of the device. In LECs, we must also take into account other mechanisms for phonon loss involving self-absorption of the doped regions and changes of the position of the neutral emitting layer over time.152–154 One of the most important challenges is therefore to develop devices with light extraction capabilities χ > 20%, which clearly exceed the limitations associated with low-refractive indices.155 Numerous efforts have been made to improve the external coupling efficiencies via improved device concepts. The latter include modifications to the electrodes, syntheses of new organic materials and device fabrication. However, the added complexity of light extraction due to its relationship with other device characteristics makes this parameter difficult and challenging to optimize.156–158 The final factor to consider concerning the optimization of device performance is the applied voltage required to switch on the device. Here, we must bear in mind, that in contrast to the electroluminescence quantum efficiency, the power conversion efficiency is inversely proportional to the applied voltage (V). To decrease the applied voltage, several methods such as the introduction of buffer layers to stabilize the interface between the electrodes and the emissive organic layers have been proposed. Applying these concepts, the lowest turn on voltage reported to-date is 2.3 V for [Ru(bpy)3](ClO4)2.159 which can be further lowered (<2 V) using redox co-reactants in the active layer.160
Today, at least in principle scientist know how to design devices with ηint approaching 100%. However, realistically this value is not >40% in a real device due to the aforementioned limitations. For high performing lighting applications, devices with high luminances of 5000 cd m−2 are required. Thus, a further reduction in applied voltage under high current density is still needed to achieve the levels of power conversion efficiency necessary to reach these goals. However, the most serious problem for broad scale applications of OLED and LECs is the long-term decrease in luminance after continuous operation of a constant current. As shown in Fig. 14, the luminance of OLEDs in a constant-electric current with a driving voltage gradually decreases on a logarithmic time scale reaching 104 h. In the case of LECs, the record stability is now around thousands of hours using constant and pulsed driving modes.57,95 It is therefore crucial to find a solution to this problem in order to prolong the lifetimes of both OLED and LEC devices to the greater than 10000 hours necessary for practical applications. In addition to understanding the chemical degradation of the molecular components of the devices after long term electrical excitation,161,162 future efforts to understand the resulting photo-chemical and photo-physical effects are also needed.

1.7 Third generation emitters based on the thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF)
As previously mentioned, device efficiency is strongly dependent on (i) the capability of the materials to convert injected charges into photons and (ii) the light out-coupling. In this respect, the TADF emission process is a very attractive mechanism to optimize the performances of devices, since both the produced and lost triplet excitons of fluorescence are converted into emissive singlets. The importance of this phenomenon is reflected in the dramatic increase in publications related to TADF-OLEDs over the past 5 years, which have had significant impact in both the photonic and optics research communities, Fig. 15. This has, however, had a lower impact on the LEC world, since the efficiencies and stabilities of devices comprising of TADF emitters have not yet reached high enough values for practical applications.163 In fact, just a few studies have demonstrated TADF electroluminescence behavior in Cu(I) complexes50,52,53,164,165 and small molecules.60,166 Therefore, a general discussion in the next section of this paper is focused on the development of TADF emitters for OLEDs. It is important to note that TADF molecules can now overcome the previously mentioned intrinsic 25% limitation imposed on fluorescence materials, achieving maximum ηint values of 100%, Fig. 16.167,168

Reproduced from ref. 168 with permission from the American Chemical Society, copyright 2013. 
The crucial factor to consider when designing a TADF OLED is the energy gap, ΔEST, between the lowest singlet (S1) and triplet (T1) excited states. When ΔEST is small, reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) from T1 can result in TADF (Fig. 16 and 17). In this respect, the radiative transition to the ground state (S0) via the thermal activation of molecules, results in TADF to an S1 excited state.169 There is therefore competition between TADF and phosphorescence processes through RISC and ISC, respectively (Fig. 17). It should also be noted that the electroluminescence efficiency of an OLED also increases as ΔEST decreases. For example, benzophenone derivatives are ketone based materials with relatively small values of ΔEST (0.1–0.2 eV) that exhibit TADF, but no intense luminescence at room temperature.170 In benzophenone, there is a small overlap between the non-bonded n-orbital on the oxygen and the excited π-orbital of the aromatic group. This small overlap leads to a small ΔEST that favors TADF. Furthermore, since their initial discovery by Adachi et al.,147 these compounds are now recognized as “third generation” OLEDs. In contrast, complexes comprising of condensed polycyclic aromatic ligands, such as anthracene, have ΔEST's greater than 1 eV and only display intense phosphorescence. From a quantum chemistry perspective, ΔEST reflects the overlap in the wave functions between the ground and excited states of the molecule, hence a subsequent decrease in the value of ΔEST leads to a decrease in this overlap (Fig. 17). In anthracene there is a strong overlap between the π and π* orbitals which affords a larger, less favorable ΔEST. Unfortunately, this situation is further complicated by the fact that a relatively large radiative rate constant (kr) is also required to design an efficient OLED, and a small ΔEST is not necessarily conducive to a large kr. An important challenge in this field is therefore the discovery of new molecules with small ΔEST and large kr. A practical approach to address this issue is to chemically tune the electron donating and withdrawing groups of the molecules to decrease the spatial overlap between their respective HOMO and LUMO frontier orbitals. Following this strategy, many families of small organic molecules, including triazines,171 spiro derivatives,172 spiro-acridine,145 phenoazine and carbazolyl dicyanobenzenes (CDCB)147 have been synthesized and studied over recent years. For an informative overview of this family of compounds the reader is directed to the review of Bryce et al.173 In addition to organic based TADF-OLEDs, inorganic systems have also attracted interest and noble metal-free TADF-OLEDs have also been reported.174

1.8 Why inorganic molecule-based TADFs?
At first glance, research progress in the field of organic-TADFs seems to have progressed very quickly. However, in recent years, research concerning their inorganic counterparts has rapidly gained momentum since they offer several important advantages that include: (1) enhanced stabilities due to the presence of metal–ligand bonds; (2) higher spin–orbit coupling (SOC) when compared to their organic counterparts that increases intersystem crossing (ISC)175 and (3) access to a broad range of organic ligands, permitting the optimization of emission color, band gap and the reduction of non-radiative deactivation processes.176 In this respect, incorporating sterically hindered ligands reduces geometrical distortions in the triplet excited states which enhances their overall quantum yields.177,178 Another approach to enhance their properties is to introduce small functional groups to improve the hole/electron injection properties of the emissive layers.179,180 To summarize, there is more scope to functionalize inorganic-TADFs when compared to their organic counterparts, since varying the organic ligands and the coordination number and geometries of the metal cations provides complementary strategies for chemically tuning their opto-electronic properties. Although, the rapid growth of TADF-OLEDs has been rather unexpected, several issues still need to be addressed before these materials realize their true commercial potential. In this respect, the most important problem is their long-term stability. Studies focused towards understanding degradation mechanisms present in TADF-OLEDs report a half-lives of ca. 2800 h when operated at an initial luminance of 1000 cd m−2,181,182 confirming that more stability is needed before these devices can be reliably utilized as the components of lighting sources and displays. Research efforts by Adachi et al. have significantly increased our fundamental understanding of the degradation processes in OLED devices. Adachi's work reveals that the host molecules can play a key role in contributing to the instability of an OLED cell during photo irradiation via the formation of active radicals and unstable species (Fig. 18).183 Stabilization of the excited triplet states of the light emitting molecules upon irradiation is therefore one of the major challenges at the forefront of this field which still needs to be resolved.184

2 Second generation emitters based on cyclometalate Ir(III) complexes
2.1 Ir(III) complexes containing 2-phenylpyridine (ppy) and 2,2′-bpyridine/1,10-phenanthroline ancillary ligands
The first reported single-component emitter was a Ru(II) complex that has been successfully utilized to fabricate thin-film electroluminescence devices, using a variety of simple-solution processing techniques.124 Electroluminescent devices fabricated from this complex have shown high electroluminescence efficiencies and luminance levels of 100 cd m−2. The first LEC containing Ir(III), [Ir(ppy)2(dtbbpy)](PF6) (1) (where ppy = 2-phenylpyridine and dtbbpy = 4,4′-di-tert-butyl-2,2′-dipyridyl), was specifically designed by Slinker et al. for use as a multifunctional chromophore for a single-layer electroluminescent device.47 In this complex, two ppy ligands are coordinated to an Ir(III) cation which further increases the ligand field stabilization energy. One advantage of devices containing this complex are their high luminous power efficiencies which exceed 10 lm W−1 at −3 V.47 Unfortunately, the degradation of these devices has also been reported, that is attributed to the current-induced heating of the organic layer, resulting in the decomposition of the dtbbpy ligand.185 Later, the same group demonstrated that an improvement in the turn-on time for the onset of light emission, Ton for electroluminescent devices based on complex 1 could be achieved by introducing the ionic liquid (IL), 1-butyl-3-methyl imidazolium hexafluorophosphate (BMIP) into the electron injection layer.186 The effect of the IL on the Ton is quite significant, in which a blend of 0.46 mol of the IL per mol of complex 1 dramatically decreases the Ton from just 5 to 40 min. According to Fig. 19, Ton and Tmax decrease exponentially with respect to the concentration of the IL.186 Highly efficient phosphorescence along with a shift in the emissive properties from yellow to blue was achieved via the introduction of dimethylamino substituents in the 4 and 4′-positions of the bipyridine ligand in complex 2 (N926).187 In this respect, the introduction of the dimethylamino group destabilizes the LUMO orbitals of the bpy ligand that subsequently increases the energy gap between the HOMO and LUMO of complex N926, when compared to its unsubstituted counterpart complex 1.

Surprisingly, a very small turn on voltage of 2.5 V was also reported for an LEC containing this complex.187 Moreover, the development of new ionic ligands has been a useful strategy to decrease the Tmax of solid state LEDs that afforded the next family of heteroleptic Ir complexes, 3–5.188 Related studies to introduce an alkyl appended NEt3+ substituent onto the 5 position of the bipyridine ligand reveal that extending the chain length of the CH2 linker from n = 1 to 4, demonstrates a significant enhancement in the efficiency of 5. In contrast, chain lengths of n > 5, reduce the efficiency of the device due to the unfavorable distances between the phosphorescent metal centers, which hinders electron transport. Efficient white light emission has been achieved for the Ir based system 6, by rationally combining red, blue and green emitters together within a single host–guest system.189 In this respect, in order to obtain white emission, a low concentration of the red-emitting guest (6) was doped into the blue-green-emitting host [Ir(dfppz)2(dedaf)](PF6), (where dfppz = 1-(2,4-difluorophenyl)pyrazole and dedaf = 9,9-diethyl-4,5-diazafluorene) to induce partial energy transfer. The resulting device displays a white EL spectrum with Commission Internationale de l’Eclairage (CIE) coordinates ranging from (x, y) = (0.45, 0.40) to (0.35, 0.39), between 2.9 and 3.3 V, and high color-rendering indices (CRI) of up to 80, which is a critical measure for solid-state lighting.
One creative approach to improve the stabilities of LECs has been to employ the supramolecular caged iTMC, 7.190 This novel complex afforded bright (2700 cd m−2 at 5 V), very stable LECs with an estimated t1/2 of approximately 600 h at 3 V, where t1/2 is defined as the time to half maximum brightness. Inter- and intramolecular π–π interactions stabilize the ground and excited states of the complex, resulting in LEC's with substantially larger lifetimes τ of 3000 h at 3 V and 200 cd m−2, without sacrificing device Tmax.191 These values represent an enormous improvement when compared to the record lifetime of 30 hours for [Ir(ppy)2(bpy)] (PF6) LECs. Interestingly, the presence of a pendant phenyl substituent on the 6-position of the bpy ligand results in a cage effect that restricts the opening of the molecular structure of complex 8 in the excited 3MC state, thereby reducing the possibility of degradation reactions. Subsequent studies on the disubstituted complex 9 reveal stronger intra- and intermolecular π–π interactions that are detrimental to the overall stability of the device, which, as a consequence, has a lifetime only 1300 h at 3 V and 70 cd m−2.192 These low performances are linked with the loss of the planarity of the bpy ligand when the phenyl substituents π-stack with the phenyl groups of the ppy ligands, that in turn makes the complex more likely to undergo emission loss and degradation. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations support this explanation revealing that the energy difference between the emitting triplet and the metal-centered triplet (3MC) states in the complex are decreased, thus rendering it more susceptible to emission losses and degradation reactions. The introduction of bulky substituents into the 5,5′-positions of the 2,2′-bipy ligand were carried out to improve the stability of the devices by spacing out the molecules of the emissive layer in order to reduce chromophore–chromophore self-quenching processes. Sun et al. have shown that a device lifetime of 100 h at a bias of −4 V can be obtained using complex 10 with phenyl substituents on the 5,5′-positions of its ancillary bpy ligands.193
Over the years, it has become apparent that preventing the quenching of the excitons in solid-state LEDs results in more durable devices. This can be achieved via the introduction of bulky substituents that weaken π–π stacking interactions, which, in turn, increases the distance between neighboring metal complexes that helps to suppress the quenching. Following this strategy, three Ir(III) complexes 11–13 were designed bearing a phenyl substituent at the 6- and a bulky substituent at the 4-positions of the 2,2′-bpyridine auxiliary ligand.194 It has been demonstrated that the photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) of complexes 11–13 increase both in solution and in thin films, as the size of the substituent on the 4-position of the bpy ligand increases.191 In this way, the introduction of large electronically inactive groups affords considerably shorter Tmax, higher luminances, higher efficiencies and longer device stabilities. Furthermore, the addition of a small amount of BMIP enhances the dynamic configuration of iTMC-based LECs, resulting in considerably enhanced stabilities of several hundreds of hours after driving the LECs with a pulsed current.195 This led to a sub-second light turn-on, exceptionally stable luminances >650 cd m−2 and power efficiencies with lifetimes >4000 h.
Following these studies, Schneider et al. prepared and studied the bis-cyclometalated Ir(III) complex 14 with a 2-naphthyl substituent at the 6-position of the ancillary 2,2′-bpyridine ligand.196 This ligand was chosen for two reasons: (i) the configuration of the excited state of the complex should be stabilized via π–π interactions and (ii) it contains bulky substituents at the 6-position of the ancillary ligand that should serve to reduce intermolecular interactions that subsequently decrease self-quenching. Complex 14 displays an emission maximum between 595–600 nm both in solution and in the thin film, consistent with emission from a triplet state with a large amount of charge-transfer character. Devices based on complex 14 have shown luminances, exceeding 300 cd m−2 and exceptional stabilities of more than 350 h.
The insertion of dinonyl substituents into the 4,4′-positions of the bpy ligand was pursued to prevent the self-quenching of blue or yellow solid state LEDs based on the Ir(III) complex 15.197 The resulting LEC device displayed a maximal brightness of 549 cd m−2 at 15.3 V and a ηext of 0.17 cd A−1. Furthermore, photobleaching of the luminescence intensity was observed after exposure to light under ambient conditions, attributed to the photoreaction of the complex with oxygen or water (Fig. 20). For complex 15, the color of the electroluminescence was tuned from blue to yellow via the addition of PVK host. Following this study, 4,4′-dinonyl-2,2′-pyridine was utilized as the ancillary ligand to prepare the Ir(III) soft salt (16), which was subsequently combined with an anionic Ir complex containing thiocyanate ligands.198 LECs prepared from these complexes revealed that the variation in color could be attributed to temperature dependent changes in the intermolecular interactions between the molecules in the emissive layers. High performances were obtained from electroluminescent phosphorescent OLEDs (PhOLEDs) fabricated by spin-coating techniques, demonstrating that soft salt-based PhOLEDs could be promising alternatives to conventional PhOLEDs fabricated from neutral complexes.

One pathway for the degradation of Ir-iTMCs in LECs is thought to involve nucleophilic attack of the positively charged metal centers. There are two ways to decrease this undesirable process, firstly by enhancing the hydrophobicity of the iTMCs, and secondly by targeting metal complexes with bulky ligands, which sterically protect the metal center. Following this approach, the new series of Ir-iTMCs (17–20) were devised, with phenyl and methyl substituents at the 6- and 4-positions of the bpy ligand in the archetypal [Ir(ppy)2(bpy)](PF6) complex.199 According to DFT calculations, the introduction of these substituents does not cause significant changes to the coordination sphere of the Ir(III) cations, but alters their HOMO–LUMO energy gap, shifting the emissive properties of the complexes to the green, which is also consistent with their electroluminescence properties (Fig. 21). Among this last family of complexes, the best stability was observed for complex 20, whose bpy ligand is substituted at both the 4,4′- and 6-6′-positions.

As part of conceptual studies describing the correlation between the chemical structure and photophysical properties of iTMCs, complexes, [Ir(ppy)2(bpy)](PF6) (17) and [Ir(ppy)2(phen)](PF6) (21) were reported by Costa et al. Complex 21 was then subsequently used as the active emitter in LECs.200 Adding small amounts of IL to the Ir-iTMC dramatically improved both the luminescence and stability of the corresponding LEC devices. As previously described, these improvements were attributed to the increase in distance between neighboring molecules in the thin films, which is thought to reduce unfavorable self-quenching effects, supported by DFT calculations. For the same reason, the use of bulky ligands also greatly enhances the lifetimes of Ru(II)-complex-based LECs. Studies have also shown that employment of the organometallic Ir complex 22, containing a bulky, 4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline-bis(2-phenylpyridine) ligand dramatically increases the lifetimes of single-layer devices, when compared to devices prepared from less bulkier derivatives.201 As a consequence, new Ir complexes of general formula [Ir(ppy)2(phen)](PF6) (23–27) containing ligands substituted with bulky side chains were explored for applications in single-layer electroluminescent LECs.202,203 In these complexes, the phen ligands are substituted with 9,9′-dihexylfluorenyl (23 and 24) and carbazole (25 and 26) moieties. Dihexylfluorenyl substituents were also introduced to increase the hydrophobicity and solubility, as well as to extend the π-systems to optimize the processability, stability and electron/hole-transport properties of the resulting devices.202 For the bulkyer, extended conjugated ligands in complexes 24 and 26, the increase in separation between the molecules in the thin film suppresses quenching, leading to a reduction in exciton migration, which in turn significantly enhances the lifetimes of their excited states.202,203 Unfortunately, higher drive voltages are required for the bulkier complexes since their charge carrier mobilities are reduced, which in turn reduces their luminous power efficiencies. DFT calculations on these systems reveal that in the singlet ground-state, the HOMO is localized over the metal cation and the benzene rings of the phenylpyridine ligands, whereas the LUMO is predominantly localized on the phenanthroline ligand.202 A maximum brightness of 1000 cd m−2 was attained at a bias of 3 V for complex 24, further highlighting the beneficial effect of its bulky substituents.
To exploit the synergy between an ionic Ir(III) complex and a perylenediimide (PDI) fluorescent red emitter, the PDI–Ir dyad (28) was prepared, which is one of the best deep red-emitting complexes reported to date.204 In this system, the Ir(III) complex functions as both the hole conductor and phosphorescence emitter, while PDI is the electron conductor. A LEC based on this dyed system has a high external EL efficiency in the deep-red region due to the high quantum yield of its PL and the short lifetimes of the excitons. The Ir(III) complex 29, containing a 2-phenyl-phen ligand, capable of displaying intramolecular π–π stacking interactions in the solid state has also been reported.205 The phenyl substituent was introduced to sterically block nucleophilic attack of the metal cations, a strategy that reduces self-quenching and increases the stability of LEC devices. Interestingly, the π–π interactions in this complex also stabilize the formation of a supramolecular cage in both the ground and excited state. A comparison of LECs based on 29 with similar LECs fabricated from supramolecular caged bipyridine-based Ir(III) complexes revealed that in these systems, the metal–ligand bond lengths in the 3MC state are important, since they contribute to the overall stability of the devices. Ir(III) complexes containing 5-methyl-phen (30) and 5,6-dimethyl-phen (31) ancillary ligands were also prepared and their electrochemical properties studied.206 LECs based on both of these complexes display yellow emission, with a low Von (approximately 3 V) and a high luminance. The device based on complex 31 had the best performance, with a maximum luminance and current density double that of complex 30, which is further supported by the absorption and PL spectra of the two systems. Ancillary phen ligands have been used to synthesize the series of cationic heteroleptic Ir(III) complexes (32–34).207 The PL spectra of complexes 32 and 33 display peaks at λmax = 546 and 540 nm, while the λmax of complex 34 is significantly red-shifted by ∼60 nm. This shift is attributed to the presence of the phenyl substituents on the ortho positions of the phen ligand, which stabilizes the LUMO when compared to the alkyl-substituted derivatives in complexes 32 and 33. Moreover, the bulky nature of the phenyl substituents also improves the luminance, current density and stability of the resulting LECs. Further studies on complex 34 reveal that the phenyl groups also acts as a physical barrier to protect the negative charge injected into the cationic Ir complex. Additional modifications to these complexes were achieved via the introduction of bipolar carrier-transporting units in the form of oxadiazole-triphenylamine auxiliary ligands, which were subsequently employed as phosphorescent dopants in polymer light-emitting diodes (PLEDs).208 The cationic Ir(III) complexes 35–37 are all amorphous and display high thermal stabilities, good solubilities, and thus are suitable for applications as phosphorescent dopants in PLEDs with the configuration ITO/PEDOT:PSS/35–37:PVK:PBD/TPBI/CsF/Al.208 Their PL and EL spectra were very similar, although the complexes were modified further with carrier-transporting groups. Among these complexes, complex 35 had the highest efficiency, most likely due to its bipolar nature that is able to regulate the balance between hole and electron fluxes more efficiently.
2.2 Ir(III) complexes containing ppy ligands and other polypyridyl ancillary ligands
The syntheses and photophysical studies of a family of cyclometallated Ir(III) complexes with β-diketonate ligands were reported by Lamansky et al.209,210 For these complexes, the PLQYs are in the range 0.1–0.4%. By choosing the appropriate ligand, the emission of the Ir complexes could be tuned from 512 to 612 nm, resulting in color variations from green to red. OLEDs based on these complexes had high ηext, values ranging from 6 to 12.3%, with complex 38 displaying the highest efficiency (12.3%, 38 lm W−1, >50 cd A−1). The complex Ir(ppy)2(pq) (39), (where pq = 2-phenylquinoline), subsequently studied as an efficient phosphorescent material with dual-color emission suitable for applications in white OLEDs (WOLEDs).211 In order to tune the emission of these complexes towards the red, a new cyclometalated Ir(ppy)3 complex was reported bearing a formyl substituent on one of the ppy ligands (40).212 This complex displayed a strong orange emission at λmax = 600 nm. OLEDs containing this complex have shown the same characteristic emission in dichloromethane solution as when doped into a PVK host, implying that the energy transfer between the PVK and the Ir(III) complex is a very efficient process. Based on these results, chemical modification of only one of the organic ligands provided a useful strategy to tune the emission wavelength. A promising approach to improve the lifetime of OLEDs containing these complexes is to increase the glass transition temperature, which serves to suppress the crystallization of amorphous emitting materials, resulting in a greater stabilization of film-based devices. With this idea in mind, the novel Ir(III) complex 41, bearing a polymerizable functional group was synthesized and used as a dopant to fabricate phosphorescent EL devices.213 The EL devices prepared by doping complex 41 into a host material, such as BCP (2,9-dimethyl-4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline), or poly(N-vinyl-carbazole) (PVCz), display a bright blue-green luminescence of ca. 12000 cd m−2. In addition, complex 41 was co-polymerized with VCz to form the Ir co-polymer 42. The EL device containing this copolymer in the light-emitting hole-transport layer had a higher EL intensity versus devices prepared via monomer-dispersed doping. Su et al. designed an ionic iridium complex with two imidazolium groups at the ends of the two alkyl side chains, [Ir(ppy)2(dC6MIM-daf)](PF6)3, where dC6MIM-daf = 9,9-bis[6-(3-methyl imidazolium)hexyl]-1-yl-4,5-diazafluorene (43), to investigate the effect of two imidazolium groups on the device efficiencies of LECs. The properties of complex 43 were compared to the reference complex [Ir(ppy)2(dC6-daf)](PF6) (44), where (dC6-daf = 9,9′-dihexyl-4,5-diazafluorene) with no imidazolium substituents.214 Similar electrochemical, photophysical properties and comparable EL efficiencies were reported for both complexes, but a significant decrease in turn-on times was recorded for LECs based on complex 43 when compared to complex 44. This advancement in turn-on times is attributed to the increase in density of mobile PF6− counterions, which in turn increase the ionic conductivity of the film containing ionic Ir complexes with imidazolium substituents. He et al. designed two blue-emitting cationic Ir complexes based on 2-(1H-pyrazol-1-yl)pyridine (pzpy) ancillary ligands as part of a strategy to shift the emission of Ir(III) complexes to the blue region of the visible spectrum.215 Complexes, [Ir(ppy)2(pzpy)](PF6) (45A) and [Ir(dfppy)2(pzpy)](PF6) (where dfppy = 2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)pyridine) (45B) both contain ancillary pzpy ligands that significantly destabilize the LUMO frontier orbitals, resulting in blue shifted emission. This shift is attributed to the electron-donating nature of the N atom of the pyrazole moiety, which increases the electron density on the pzpy ancillary ligand. [Ir(dfppy)2(pzpy)](PF6) has an anodically shifted oxidation potential and displays blue-shifted emission spectra when compared to [Ir(ppy)2(pzpy)](PF6) due to the presence of the electron-withdrawing fluorine substituents on its ppy ligand. LECs based on complexes 45A and 45B display green-blue electroluminescence with a relatively high efficiency of 4.3 cd A−1. Using complex 45B as the dopant, deep-blue electrophosphorescence was also obtained with a λmax at 458 nm and CIE coordinates of (0.16, 0.22).216 Modification of the dfppy ligand via the introduction of a pendant hydrophobic phenyl ring in complex 46, dramatically enhances the stability of the resulting LEC.217 As described earlier, the bulky nature of the phenyl substituent on the N atom prevents the complex from being readily attacked by nucleophilic molecules such as water. Hou et al. prepared and studied the properties of a number of Ir complexes and subsequently used them as the emissive components of highly efficient phosphorescent OLEDs.218–220 Studies on these systems reveal that amidinates are useful ancillary ligands in phosphorescent bis-cyclometalated Ir(III) complexes, affording significant improvements in the emissive properties of the complexes due to the reduction of self-quenching and decrease in sensitivity compared to the concentration of the dopant.218 As a consequence, complex 47 afforded low-driving-voltage red phosphorescent OLEDs over a broad range of doping concentrations, even when the complex was not doped directly into a host matrix. Substituting ppy for fluorine in 47 afforded a complex of formula (dfppy)2Ir(N,N′-diisopropylbenzamidine) that has superior hole and electron transport (HT and ET) properties, due to the well-matched energy levels between the HT and ET material.220 For this system, the high electron/hole mobility is attributed to the strong electron-withdrawing nature of its fluorine substituents, which lowers the energy levels of the LUMO and HOMO frontier orbitals when compared to 47. This novel complex was not only an efficient phosphorescent emitter, profiting from its own high PL efficiency in the solid state, but it is also an excellent host for a yellow phosphorescent dopant, affording high-performance PhOLEDs. Following these studies, guanidinate compounds were employed as ancillary ligands, and the novel family of structurally well-defined, phosphorescent heteroleptic cyclometalated Ir(III) complexes 48–58 were reported.221 Since guanidinate has an additional amino group on its central carbon when compared to amidate, it is more electron-donating, and thus an excellent choice of ancillary ligand for the stabilization of electron-deficient metal centers. This, in turn, serves to increase the hole injection (HI and HT) properties of the resulting complexes, which show intense emission at room temperature, with λmax values in the range of 528–560 nm and PLQYs of 0.16–0.37 (Fig. 22). As observed in Fig. 22, the electroluminescent (EL) emission of the complexes can be tuned from green to yellow by choosing the appropriate guanidinate ligand. The steric bulk and electron-donating capabilities of the guanidinate ligands protect the metal cations, prevent significant triplet–triplet annihilation and reduce non-emissive pathways facilitated via intermolecular excited-state interactions. In addition, these factors promote HI and hole transportation resulting in complexes with very favorable EL properties. In these systems, varying the ancillary ligand has only a small effect on the color of the emission. However, despite these observations, the relative energy levels of the main and ancillary ligands of the complexes permit their emissive properties to be tuned, providing a strategy to optimize the luminous efficiency of the devices by facilitating inter-ligand energy transfer (ILET).

In order to explore the modulation of the relative triplet states of the C,N and ancillary ligands, oxadiazole (OXD)-, benzoxazolate-, and benzothiazolate-based Ir(III) complexes (59–61) were synthesized and subsequently fabricated into OLEDs.222,223 The aforementioned ancillary ligands have high electron affinities, making them good candidates for electron injection and transport, as well as high PLQY and good chemical and thermal stabilities. Studies of these complexes revealed which of the EL properties were influenced by ILET.222,223 Expanding these studies further, hybrid fluorescent/phosphorescent white OLEDs, comprising of complex 61 that is a yellow/green phosphorescent emitter were fabricated.228 Subsequent studies reveal that a device prepared from complex 61 has a high color rending index (CRI) of up to 89, with EQE, CE and ηp of 20%, 55.2 cd A−1 and 49.6 lm W−1 respectively.228 Ligands based on 1,3,4-OXD were also used to synthesize a series of Ir(III) complexes that include 62 and 63 for subsequent applications in LECs.160 Studies show that systematically changing the substituents or replacing the OXD ligand varies the PL and EL properties of the device. Complexes 62 and 63 were reported to be red emitters with λmax = 616–624 nm (Fig. 23). LECs comprising of complexes 62 and 63 displayed very high efficiencies or brightness, which have been attributed to the lower amount of quenching of the MLCT transitions brought about by the OXD ancillary ligand.

Ir(III) multilayer LECs comprising of complex 64 were also investigated.225 A layer of PVK was inserted beneath the Ir(III) layer to produce a pinhole-free device that facilitates hole transport due to the low solubility of the anionic Ir complex. This device emits a pale green light, which is almost independent of the driving voltage, showing stable CIE coordinates from 4 to 7 V. In addition to the adjustment of the wavelength of phosphorescence, the band widths of the electroluminescence in these complexes could also be tuned from blue to red via functionalization of their organic ligands with appropriate electron withdrawing or electron donating substituents.226 Following this strategy oxazoline (65) and thiazoline (66) containing heteroleptic Ir(III) complexes were prepared and doped into a CBP host to afford PhOLEDs with efficient green and yellow emission.226 Although the PhOLEDs prepared from these complexes had similar EL emission with λmax values between 530 and 540 nm, they had different colors due to the significant differences in the values of full width at half-maximum of their emission spectra, with 2 of them being 70 and 110 nm for complexes 65 and 66, respectively. DFT calculations on these systems reveal that the HOMO–LUMO energy gap for complex 65 is larger, presumably since the more polarizable S atom of the thiazoline increases the conjugation of the ligand, resulting in a smaller energy gap.
As previously mentioned, choosing suitable ancillary ligands to develop new complexes with blue-light emission is an important challenge at the forefront of this field. Blue-green-emitting Ir complexes have been designed and synthesized by introducing N,N′ chelates based on triazol-pyridine ligands (67–69).227 The N,N′-heteroaromatic ancillary ligands in these systems have high triplet energy levels, and the lone pair of electrons on their N atoms can effectively regulate the energy levels of their LUMOs. The order of the peak maxima in their emission spectra is Ir(ppy)3 > 67 > 68 > 69, which is correlated to the increase in the electron-withdrawing capability of their organic ligands. A device based on complex 69 was reported to have the best performance, displaying the highest current and power efficiency, while devices based on complexes 67 and 68 display lower roll-off efficiencies, attributed to the increase in conjugation of their organic ligands. Furthermore, the larger torsional angle between the triazole and phenyl rings in ligand 67 increases the steric hindrance, resulting in a lower roll-off efficiency when compared to devices containing complex 68.
2.3 Ir complexes containing ppy ligands functionalized with large aromatic substituents
The synthesis and characterization of a new family of phosphorescent Ir(III) complexes assembled from diphenylaminofluorene ligands (70 and 71) was carried out to explore the potential of Ir(III) phosphors for applications as emissive dopants in OLEDs that are deposited via vacuum deposition.229 Charged, emissive metal complexes with short lifetimes both solution and the solid state were successfully vacuum-deposited without any significant decomposition. Due to the higher PL quantum efficiencies of complex 70, the resulting OLED devices A–C were doped with three concentrations namely, 2.5% (A), 5% (B), and 8% (C). Examining Fig. 24, it is apparent that the brightness of the device at a given current density slightly increases as the concentration of the dopant is increased from 2.5 to 8 wt%. Additional studies revealed that devices doped with a 5 wt% of complex 70 yielded the most efficient electrophosphorescence with a brightness greater than 15000 cd m−2 and power efficiencies and luminance as high as 19 lm W−1 and 20 cd A−1, respectively.

A new family of highly efficient red-emitting phosphorescent Ir(III) complexes (72–77), were prepared using carbazole (CVz)–phenylquinoline (PhQ) and picolinic acid N-oxide (pic-N-O) ligands, and subsequently used for the fabrication of PhOLEDs.230 CVz ligands are electron-donating and thus their complexes display relatively intense luminescence and excellent photoconductivities. In addition, PhQ ligands are well-known for their ability to afford conjugated systems displaying excellent mechanical properties together with electronic, opto-electronic, and/or non-linear optical (NLO) properties. Cyclic voltammetry studies of these complexes, Fig. 25, reveal that their electrochemical band gaps lie between 2.50 and 2.52 eV, which are consistent with their optical band gaps (2.44–2.50 eV), recorded at the onset of their absorption spectra. All six complexes possess high thermal stabilities and emit intense red light with excellent color purities and CIE coordinates (0.65, 0.34). A maximum brightness of 18500 cd m−2 was achieved at 215 mA cm−2 for a device containing complex 73 as the dopant. Complexes containing pic ancillary ligands displayed high current densities at the same voltage due to their high electron mobilities.230 In this respect, pic and pic-NO ligands have stronger negative inductive effects when compared to their acac counterparts. The performances of PhOLEDs fabricated from this family of Ir(III) complexes are in good agreement with results from DFT calculations. Following this work,230 a new bulky trimethylsilylxylene-substituted Ir(III) complex 78, containing a pic-ancillary ligand was synthesized in high yields via a Suzuki coupling reaction.231 PhOLEDs containing this new dopant exhibited yellow-green emission with a λmax = 528 nm. Since the ionic nature of the complex affects not only the Ton, but also the stability of the resulting devices, Kwon et al. reported a new method to reduce the Ton and increase stabilities of light-emitting LECs by using the neutral Ir complex 79.232 Complex 79 containing a pendant Na+ ion was introduced instead of the classic iTMC with a charge balancing counter anion complex 80. Despite the similar electrochemical and photophysical energy gaps for devices assembled from complexes 79 and 80, they emit red light at −3.6 and −5.6 V respectively, as the voltage is increased. Furthermore, the LEC containing complex 79 has a 60-fold faster Ton when compared to the cationic iTMC 80. This is presumably due to the faster delivery of the Na+ cations to the electrode (Fig. 26). Considering device lifetimes, complex 79 reached maximum brightness three times faster and displayed a 6-fold increase in its stability at a constant bias when compared to complex 80.232 For the development of efficient red emissive OLEDs, 1-(dibenzo[b,d]furan-4-yl)isoquinolinato-N,C3′(dbfiq), 5-isobutyryl-ppy and 5-acetyl-ppy-derived Ir(III) complexes were developed with high PLQY and good device performances.233–235 It was expected that complexes 81–83 comprising of dbfiq ligands together with rigid, extended π-conjugated frameworks would afford pure, saturated red emission with high quantum efficiency. Moreover, 1,3-bis(3,4-dibutoxyphenyl)propane-1,3-dionate-O,O (bdbp) was introduced into complex 81 to increase its solubility in organic solvents.233 Among these complexes, device based on complex 81 has shown the best performance with a Lmax of 7270 cd m−2 at 16.5 V and a ηext of 6.4%.233 Isobutyl substituents were introduced into the β-diketonate ligands to tune the band gap by lowering the energy levels of their LUMO frontier orbitals and to provide steric bulk in order to prevent close intermolecular interactions between neighboring molecules.235 In these systems, the electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups enhances the electron mobility and thus improves the charge balance in the emitting layers of the devices. Due to the increasing π-conjugation of the ligands in this series, complexes 84, 85, and 87 exhibit a bathochromic shift when compared to the PL spectra of complex 86. The introduction a 1-naphthyl substituent into the 5-isobutyryl-2-arylpyridine ligand of complex 85 afforded saturated red colors due to its narrower band gap. Devices doped with complex 86 displayed the best performances with Lmax of 35500 cd m−2 at 14 V and luminance and power efficiencies of 15.5 cd A−1 and 6.23 lm W−1 at 20 mA cm−2, respectively.235 Ir(III) complexes 88–93 containing a 5-acetyl-ppyhad ligand display suitable orange/red emission for OLED applications.234 To study how the solubility of the Ir complexes influences the efficiency of multi-layer solution-processed OLEDs, four Ir complexes with the same ligand core, 94–97, were synthesized.236 Studies of complex 94 reveal that the tert-butyl group significantly improves the solubility and thus it demonstrates the highest efficiency when fabricated into a device. Furthermore, by fine tuning the singlet and triplet energies of bipolar hosts based on indolocarbazole/1,3,5-triazine hybrids237 and (3′-(4,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-triazin-2-yl)-(1,1′-biphenyl)-3-yl)-9-carbazole (CzTrz)/tris(4-(9H-carbazol-9-yl)phenyl)amine (TCTA) to form an exciplex,238 OLEDs constructed with complex 94 have shown EQEs of 24.5 and 27%, respectively, which are some of the best values reported for orange PHOLEDs to-date.

To optimize the energy transfer from the host to the guest material, carbazole and arylamine substituents have been appended to a ppy backbone and used for the synthesis of Ir(III) complexes 98–101, which were subsequently fabricated into OLEDs.239 Studies reveal that complexes with carbazole ligands have desirable phosphorescent properties due to the ability of the rigid carbazole group to promote light harvesting and facilitate efficient energy transfer to the guest molecules. In addition, chemical modification of the molecular structure of the ppy ligand can be carried out to increase the energy level of the HOMO, which in turn increases the hole-transporting abilities of the phosphorescent centers.
To survey the effects of having multiple π–π stacking domains within the coordination sphere of the Ir(III) center, the synthesis and characterization of a series of cyclometalated Ir(III) complexes, 102–109, have been reported.240 In order to prevent disadvantageous effects related to the presence of chlorido-impurities which can reduce the performance of the iTMC in LEC devices, the complexes were synthesized without using chloride dimer intermediates.241 Variable temperature solution 1H NMR and single crystal X-ray diffraction studies confirm that within the coordination sphere of the Ir(III) center, the pendant phenyl domains engage in multiple face-to-face π–π interactions (Fig. 27). All the complexes show superior luminescent properties, especially when used in thin solid films. LECs based on these complexes (i.e., with and without intra-cation π–π stacking interactions) afford very stable luminance outputs over time, even when driven at elevated current densities. Consequently, the device lifetime is significantly enhanced, reaching more than 2500 h under accelerated testing conditions for the most stable LEC. As shown in Table 5, the best performance was observed for devices containing complex 102, with a maximum efficiency of 3.5 cd A−1 and a luminance of 1024 cd m−2 (at an average current density of 300 A m−2), as well as an extrapolated lifetime in excess of 2800 h (the time to reach 50% of the maximum luminance). This is attributed to the presence of the phenyl substituents on the C^N ligand that reside on the periphery of the complex and are, thus, not involved in inter-ligand π–π stacking interactions close to the Ir(III) coordination sphere. In contrast to the above example, it is useful to note that despite the advantages of these interactions,245–247 this has not been used as a general design principle,248,249 since it does not ultimately improve the stability of the LED. Afterward, Suhr and co-workers designed a single-layer LEC with complex 102 as the emitter, along with an ionic LiPF6, additive to facilitate high device performance.244 The resulting devices exhibit modest lifetimes, reduced response times, with peak luminances of 5400 ± 100 cd m−2, which are 50% and 80% higher than the salt-free and unoptimized devices, respectively (Fig. 28). The enhanced performance is attributed to the blocking of reactive hydrogen species para to the Ir–N bonds of the cyclometalate ligands, as well as the preservation of steric bulk which reduces the self-quenching of the luminescence.250 The enhancement of the device efficiency can be attributed to both the smart design of the emissive complex and control of space charge effects at the device interfaces with ionic additives. In these condition, a more balanced carrier injection arises from superior cationic space charge at the cathode, which increase electron injection.73,251 The effect of the LiPF6 salt additive on the enhancement of device performance is clearly observed in Fig. 28.

Recently, Ir(III) complexes 110–112, were prepared to study the influence of an electron-withdrawing formyl group on the optoelectronic and phosphorescence properties of the resulting complexes. The complexes were fabricated into OLEDs via solution processing methods since all were reported to have excellent thermal stabilities.242 Although complex 100 had similar PL peaks to complex 102, its emission was blue-shifted because of the oxygen lone-pair of the ppy-CHO ligand lowers the energy level of the HOMO, affording a larger band gap. Following this work,242 Hierlinger and co-workers reported a new series of cationic Ir(III) complexes 113–117, in which the cyclometalate C^N ligands were modified with bulky substituents at the 4-position of the pyridine and/or the 3-position of the phenyl rings containing also dtbubpy (4,4′-di-tert-butyl-2,2′-bipyridine), to investigate the effect of sterics on both the photophysics and LEC device performance.243 Neat film and solution emission studies of these complexes revealed that the bulky substituents do not significantly affect the emission energies, Fig. 29. Among LEC devices based on complexes 113, 114, 1 and 115, the best current efficiency (7.4 cd A−1), highest luminance (737 cd m−2) and EQE (2.6%) was reported for complex 113. It is noteworthy that the reported EQE values, (1.2–2.6%), of these complexes are in line with the typical values for efficient yellow LECs. Furthermore, the cell efficiency is in agreement with the PLQY and EQE values of the film. In fact, the performance of the devices are 115 > 1 > 114, confirming how the quality of the thin films are strongly linked to the performance of the cells.

2.4 Ir(III) complexes containing ppy ligands bearing small substituents
Any new class of electroluminescent devices developed for full-color displays and illumination-quality lighting must have emissive properties in the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum. The majority of iTMC-based devices are comprised of Ru or Os complexes, which emit in the red.252–257 Neutral complexes containing Ir(III) metal centers have also been used in OLEDs as emitters and are known to also emit efficiently in the red, green, and blue parts of the spectrum.258–260 In 2004, the ionic Ir(III) complex 1 was used for the first time to fabricate electroluminescent devices with yellow emission.47 Green emission has been reported by Slinker et al., for a single-layer device comprising of the ionic Ir(III) complex (118).261 Studies reveal that the mesomeric and inductive effects of the fluoro-substituent on the phenyl ring of the ligand are responsible for the blue-shifted emission.261ηext of up to 1.1 and 1.8% were achieved for devices containing Au and CsF/Al top contacts, respectively. The device efficiency varies in the same order as the work function (WF) of the contacts i.e. WFCsF/Al < WFITO < WFAu.261 Furthermore, addition of the ionic liquid (BMIP) produced a bias-dependent shift in the electroluminescence spectrum of this complex, significantly improving the response times of the device (Fig. 30).

Electrochemical and luminescence studies of both neutral and ionic Ir(III) complexes reveal that using fluorinated cyclometalate ligands give rise to large HOMO–LUMO gaps, resulting in high-energy emission.209,262–264iTMCs have also been explored to drive electron-transfer reactions.265 Lowry et al. reported the synthesis of the iTMC 119, containing a multifluorinated cyclometalate ppy and a charge-transport enhancing dtbbpy ligand.266 The strongly electron-withdrawing fluoro-substituents on the 2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)-5-trifluoromethylpyridine ligand, or the dF(CF3)ppy make the metal cation more electron deficient, resulting in a significant increase in the metal-centered redox potential to almost 500 mV when compared to ppy. As seen in Fig. 31, for both 119 and 1, the LUMO is located on the π-system of the dtbbpy ligand, but the large HOMO–LUMO gap for complex 119 shifts the electroluminescence to higher energy which means that devices based on this complex emit blue-green light at λmax = 500 nm.266 Small chemical modifications to one of the simplest ionic Ir(III) heteroleptic complexes, 120, gave a PLQY of almost 100% for a solid film with green emission.267 The LEC based on this complex has external and power efficiencies of 15% and 40 lm W−1, respectively. These high external efficiencies are possible only if a near-quantitative internal electron-to-photon conversion occurs. The synthesis of the stable, green EL Ir tris-heteroleptic ionic complex 121, was also reported with a luminance of ∼1000 cd m−2 (Fig. 32), an efficiency of ∼3%, and a stability of approximately 55 h.268 The EL spectrum of LECs containing this complex lies between the LECs prepared from its two bis-heteroleptic counterparts, a result supported by both photophysical studies and quantum chemical calculations. It is noteworthy that the ηext of devices based on complexes 1, 106 and 105 showed the order 1 > 121 > 120, which is the reverse order of their PLQY values in solution, i.e.120 > 121 > 1.268 Additionally, the lifetime of the three devices also follows the order 1 > 121 > 120, indicating that the stability of the LECs is reduced as the number of fluorine substituents in the ligand increases.

Despite their importance for tuning the emissive properties of coordination complexes, the bulky nature of the organic ligands and their ability to suppress self-quenching by sterically protecting the metal centers must also be carefully considered when designing new ligands for OLED applications. To investigate the influence of bulky ligands on reducing self-quenching, the cationic Ir(III) complexes 122 and 123, which contain sterically hindered, bulky, 4,5-diaza-9,9′-spirobifluorene (sb) ligands were designed.269 According to Fig. 33, the Ir center of complex 122 is coordinated by two cyclometalated ppy ligands and one sb ligand in a distorted octahedral geometry. The sb containing ligands increase the steric hindrance of the complexes that in turn decreases self-quenching. Photoluminescence studies reveal that both complexes display high EQEs in neat films.269 Cyclic voltammetry studies indicate that the HOMO energy level is reduced in these complexes due to the presence of the fluoro-substituents on the phenyl ring of the ppy ligand. This causes a blue shift in the emission of complex 123 when compared to the PL emission of the unsubstituted complex 122. Devices fabricated from single-layered neat films of complexes 122 and 123 possess high peak ηext and power efficiencies of 7.1% and 22.6 lm W−1 for complex 122, and 7.1% and 26.2 lm W−1 for complex 123.269 Moreover, the PL and EL properties of a host–guest cationic complex, employing the orange emissive complex 122 as the guest and the green-emissive complex 123 as the host, were also investigated.270 The results have shown that after optimization of the host–guest composition, the host–guest LECs had greatly enhanced quantum efficiencies of up to 10.4%, which represents a 1.5-times enhancement over their independent host and guest devices.270

To gain further insight into the structure–property relationships of iTMCs, Hasan et al. reported studies on the family of cationic Ir(III) complexes 124–127, bearing 2,5-dipyridylpyrazine (2,5-dpp) and 2,2′:5′,2′′-terpyridine ancillary ligands.90 CV studies demonstrated that the extra nitrogen atom in the central pyrazine ring causes a +80 mV shift of the redox potentials of complexes 124 and 127. Devices based on complexes 124 and 126 display appreciable brightness and had good stabilities. A device based on complex 126 achieved the best performance which is consistent with the trend in predicted energies for their HOMOs namely, 126 (−5.76 eV) < 124 (−5.86 eV) < 125 (−6.05 eV) < 127 (−6.14 eV).90 In this respect, we can conclude that complex (111) had the lowest oxidation potential and thus is the most efficient at facilitating hole injection. One of the principal problems of LECs is the lack of true blue-emission in cationic coordination complexes which is required for full color and white-light-emission for display applications. In an attempt to prepare a blue light-emitting LEC, the wide-bandgap Ir(III) complex 128 was prepared. Studies reveal that this complex displays blue light emission with a λmax of 476 nm when photoexcited in a thin film, with a PLQY of 52%.271 DFT calculations suggest that at least three low-energy triplet states exist for this complex within a narrow energy window (Fig. 34). Due to the different nature of these states, their geometries are not equivalent and hence their relaxation to the ground state is accompanied by the emission of photons of different energies. In this respect, only one triplet state results in green light emission, while the other two give emissions in the blue region of the spectrum. Nevertheless, the electroluminescence spectrum of complex 128 was shifted by 80 nm relative to its photoluminescence spectrum, resulting in the emission of green light, which is probably due to the high concentration of iTMC within the thin film.271

Replacing the 3,4,7,8-tetramethyl-phen ancillary ligand with 4,7-diphenyl-phen in complex 128 affords the new complex 129. A LEC based on complex 129 emits yellow-green electroluminescence at λmax = 533 nm, with maximum luminance and a current density of 330 cd m−2 and 15.57 mA cm−2 at 10 V, respectively.272 The effect of two different imidazolium-based ILs, BMIP and 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate (EMIP), on the active layer also show that the luminance and current density of these devices increase with increasing ionic conductivity.
Chen et al. achieved a longer lifetime in LEC devices through the rational design of cationic Ir complexes, 130–132. These complexes contain sterically hindered sb, N∧N ancillary ligands, bearing one or two pendant phenyl groups namely, 3-phenyl-sb (131) and 3,6-diphenyl-sb (132), together with an electron-deficient cyclometalated C∧N ligand, to foster optimal intramolecular co-facial π–π interactions.273 The X-ray crystal structures of complexes 131 and 132 demonstrate strong intramolecular face-to-face π–π stacking interactions between the pendant phenyl ring and the difluorophenyl ring of the cyclometalate ligands with distances of 3.38 Å for complex 131 and 3.40 and 3.46 Å for complex 132, Fig. 35. This leads the authors to conclude that the significant longer lifetime of LEC devices based on complex 131 is due to an increase in the π–π stacking interactions that serves to minimize the expansion of the metal–ligand bonds in the excited state. In this respect, a 4-fold lifetime enhancement was observed for a device based on complex 131, compared to complex 130 without the pendant phenyl substituent. It is worth noting that the device lifetimes of complexes 130–132 were 141, 585 and 102 min, respectively (Fig. 36). In general, the iTMCs used in LECs have molecular weights <1000 g mol−1, which afford good solubilities in a wide range organic solvents. However, good solubilities can also sometimes hamper the formation of thin films. The quality of such films can subsequently be improved via the addition of small amounts of an inactive polymer or an IL.

In this respect it could also be anticipated that the stability of LECs could be enhanced via the covalent attachment of iTMCs to polymer chains. The first example of a polymeric LEC contained the Ir(III) complex 133, affording devices with higher stabilities when compared to those fabricated from small molecular-weight complexes.96 This complex has been chemically tuned to emit in the deep-red of the visible spectrum through the introduction of electron-withdrawing ester substituents on the bpy ligand. The enhanced stabilities and longer emission wavelengths are attributed to a uniform distribution of active iTMCs in complex 134 because of their chemical linkage to the polymer backbone. Red phosphorescent emitters for OLEDs were also synthesized from Ir(III) complexes 135–140, containing 5-benzoyl-2-phenylpyridine ligands. Fluorine and methyl substituents were introduced to chemically tune the band gaps of these complexes by adjusting the energy levels of their HOMO and LUMO frontier orbitals.274 Studies demonstrated that structural modifications to the organic ligands of phosphorescent Ir(III) complexes can improve the EL performances of the corresponding OLEDs. In later work, tuning the yellow-green to orange colors of the triplet emitters 141–144 with enhanced charge injection/charge transporting features was achieved via the functionalization of both polypyridyl ancillary ligands and the phenyl ring of their ppy ligands.275 The EL spectra of these complexes have shown a negligible voltage dependence, resulting in improved color stabilities as the voltage was increased. Moreover, functionalizing the ppy ligands with an electron-withdrawing dicyanovinyl substituent, revealed that the emission energy of the resulting Ir complexes 145–149 strongly depends on both the position and the electronic nature of the substituents. These changes facilitated broad tuning of the photoluminescence properties from blue/green to deep red.276 It also leads to the discovery of a highly efficient blue OLED containing FIrpic (150) doped into CDBP host, highlighting that the selection of the host material is an important consideration when optimizing the emission efficiency of OLEDs.277 In comparison with the CBP thin film, which has shown a complicated non-exponential transient photoluminescence decay curve, the CDBP thin film displays a mono-exponential decay curve with a relatively long lifetime of 1.4 μs (Fig. 37). As part of a study to develop blue-emitting materials, Seo et al. reported a family of highly efficient, deep-blue phosphorescent Ir(III) complexes based on picolinic acid N-oxide (151 and 152),278 acetylacetone, biimidazole (153–155),279 and picolinato (156 and 157)280 ancillary ligands. These new Ir(III) complexes were thermally and electrochemically stable with excellent photoluminescence efficiencies of over 80%.278 As previously described, the energy levels of these complexes were optimized with the introduction of electron-donating and electron-withdrawing substituents onto their ppy ligand. A high performance OLED fabricated from complex 152 provided a high ηext (23.3%) with deep-blue emission and CIE coordinates of (0.15, 0.21) (Fig. 38).278 The CF3 substituents on the phenylpyridine-based ligand played an important role in tuning the electronic states of the complex, resulting in a hypsochromic shift of the emission spectra.278,280 The subsequent introduction of a hexylcarbazolyl substituent facilitated energy transfer from the carbazole units to the Ir(III) cores of the heteroleptic cyclometalated Ir(III) complexes 153–157, resulting in an increase in luminous intensity without any change in the mission color.279,280 Moreover, the conjugation effect due to the presence of a fluorine substituent on the 3-position of the phenyl ring of the ppy ligand (158–160) increases the HOMO energy level when compared to the 2- and 4-fluorinated ppy analogues with lower HOMOs.281 Furthermore, it has also been shown that replacement of electron-donating with electron-withdrawing substituents on the ortho-metalated phenyl ring affords blue emission, and increases the oxidation potential of the complex.304 However, for use in blue OLEDs, cyclometalated Ir complexes 161 and 162 have lower HOMOs in the presence of a commonly used host and display higher performances when compared to the standard FIrpic emitter. Devices comprising of 161 possess excellent color stabilities, excellent electroluminescence properties and very low efficiency roll-offs of about 1% at 1000 cd m−2.282

A substantial improvement in the performance of OLEDs was achieved for Ir complexes containing tetraphenylimidodiphosphinate (tpip) ancillary ligands.283–285,287 Zhu et al. reported the synthesis of two bis-cyclometalated Ir(III) complexes (163 and 164). These complexes were designed as green or blue-green emitters, with short excitation lifetimes that are capable of electron transport. The goal was to ultimately exploit these compounds for phosphorescent OLEDs with low efficiency roll-offs (Fig. 39).283 Tpip with its polar PO bond has a short excitation lifetime that in turn affects the emission wavelengths of the complexes. For devices based on complex 163, the efficiency roll-off from 100 to 1000 cd m−2 was only 11.88%. Devices incorporating complexes 163 and 163 have shown good EL performances, which are attributed to their carrier transport properties and the short lifetimes of their excited states.

In a correlated study, a series of Ir(III) complexes, 165–170, with tpip ancillary ligands were synthesized to investigate how the substitution pattern and number of trifluoromethyl substituents on the ppy ligands effects OLED performance.284 Complex 170 with two meta CF3 substituents displays higher oxidation potentials and its emission spectrum undergoes a bathochromic shift of 25 nm compared to complex 165. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) of complexes 165–170 revealed good thermal stabilities up to 380 °C, suggesting that all the six complexes are suitable for the fabrication of thin films, where purification by sublimation methods are feasible.284Fig. 40 illustrates the EL spectra, power efficiency, current efficiency versus J curves and voltage–luminance characteristics for each device. The Von for devices of complexes 166–170 are in the range 3.5–3.9 V (Fig. 40(d)). Amongst this series of compounds, a device fabricated from complex 168 displays the best performance with a maximum luminance of over 39000 cd m−2 (Fig. 40(d)). As expected, the substitution patterns of the three fluorine atoms appended to the phenyl ring of the ppy ligand also affects the emission properties of the complexes 171–173. The application of the Htpip ligand improves the overall electron mobility of the complexes, making them comparable to the popular electron transport material Alq3 at the same electric fields.285 The EL efficiency roll-off properties at high current density in all of the devices were low, which is beneficial compared to OLEDs with high efficiencies and brightness levels. It is interesting to note that introducing CF3 groups into both the ppy and Htpip ligands of complex 168, increases the electron mobility of the device that had a high ηp of 113.23 lm W−1 and a CE of 115.39 cd A−1 (174).286 Moreover, the same trends were also observed when ortho and para F/CF3 substituents were introduced into the ppy and tpip ligands,287 affording complexes 175–177. All the devices fabricated from these complexes maintained high efficiencies at high brightness (more than 40000 cd m−2), signifying their usefulness for practical applications that include lighting. Furthermore, devices containing the new bipolar host material, 4,4′-(6-(thiophen-2-yl)-1,3,5-triazine-2,4-diyl)bis(N,N-diphenylaniline), or TTT, afforded onset voltages between 2.9 V to 3.0 V, which is about 0.5 V less than those of structurally similar OLEDs with an mCP host.305

Two blue-emitting cationic Ir(III) complexes 178 and 179 containing 2,2′-biimidazole ancillary ligands were subsequently synthesized. These complexes have good solubilities in organic solvents and were capable of forming good thin films.288 Again, the introduction of electron-withdrawing CF3 substituents onto the 3-position of the phenyl ring of their ppy ligands increases the energy gap between their HOMO and LUMO frontier orbitals, leading to a hypsochromic shift when compared to the parent Ir(III) complexes.288 This shift was similar to that observed for the blue-emitting soft salt-based Ir(III) complex, [(F2CH3-ppy)2Ir(dppmp)],306 (where dppmp = 2-[(diphenylphosphino)methyl]pyridine). Studies revealed that complexes 178 and 179 are thermally stable and good candidates for blue phosphors in solution-processed OLEDs. Furthermore, it was also shown that biimidazole-type N,N′ ancillary ligands can invoke a significant destabilization of the LUMO energies of the three complexes, [Ir(dFppy)2(H2biim)](PF6), [Ir(dFppy)2(dMebiim)](PF6) and [Ir(dFppy)2(o-xylbiim)](PF6), (where H2biim, dMebiim and o-xylbiim are 1H,1′H-2,2′-biimidazole, 1,1′-dimethyl-2,2′biimidazole and 1,1′-(α,α′-o-xylylene)-2,2′-biimidazole, respectively).307 Unfortunately, the poor solubilities of these complexes prohibited them from being used in solution-processed devices. However, aryl-substitution of the diimine ligand and the mesityl groups of the ppy ligand was able to significantly improve the solution-state photoluminescence quantum efficiencies, solubilities and quenching processes.193,308,309 Following this strategy, two cationic green- to blue-emitting, fluorinated Ir complexes, 180 and 181, were studied. Both complexes possess highly efficient, deep blue emission in both MeCN solution and PMMA thin films.289 He et al. carried out systematic studies on blue-green, red and white OLEDs containing cationic Ir complexes with imidazole-type ancillary ligands.216,290,291,310 The latter can be easily prepared and able to blue-shift the emission spectra of the resulting complexes.290 By tuning the conjugation of the imidazole-type ligands, LECs based on the cationic Ir complexes 182–187 have shown blue-green (497 nm) to red (650 nm) electroluminescence, Fig. 41.

High efficiencies of 8.4, 18.6, and 13.2 cd A−1 were attained for the resulting blue-green, yellow, and orange emitting devices, with ηext of 3.4%, 6.0%, and 6.1%, respectively. White LECs were obtained by doping the red-emissive complex 186 into the active layer of a blue-green LEC based on complex 183. The resulting white LECs provided warm-white light with CIE coordinates of (0.42, 0.44), and color-rendering indexes (CRI) of up to 81, and a peak power efficiency of 10 lm W−1.290 In addition to their use in LECs, these complexes are also promising phosphorescent dopants for solution-processed OLEDs.310 Complexes containing ppy ligands were found to show better device performances than their 2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)pyridyl counterparts. Studies also revealed that the ionic nature of these complexes is beneficial for reducing the aggregation of the dopants in the polar host, which results in less severe TTA at high current densities.216,310 Cationic Ir complexes 188 and 189, with N-heterocyclic carbene–pyridine ancillary ligands (Fig. 42) also exhibit blue light emission in CH3CN solution, attributed to the destabilization of their LUMO orbitals.291 Devices based on 189 have shown inferior electroluminescent properties versus188, due to their lower HOMOs as a consequence of the electron withdrawing fluorine substituents on the cyclometalated ancillary ligands.291

Recently, Sunesh et al. reported cationic Ir(III) complexes 190–197, containing imidazole ancillary ligands, as light-emitting complexes for LECs.292,293 Imidazole-based ancillary ligands destabilize the LUMOs of heteroleptic Ir complexes, shifting their emissive properties to the blue region of the visible spectrum. LECs fabricated from complexes 190 and 191 exhibited green and blue-green electroluminescence, respectively.292 Although tuning the colors of their emission was successfully achieved, they have shown maximum current efficiencies of only 1.0 cd A−1 and 0.88 cd A−1 respectively, attributed to the presence of strong intermolecular interactions between neighboring molecules within the film.
To reduce these interactions, imidazole-based ancillary ligands bearing alkyl substituents with a range of chain lengths were developed, affording complexes 192–197.293 Although increasing the length of the alkyl chain did not significantly shift the emission wavelengths of the complexes, the luminance and efficiencies of LECs based on these complexes were enhanced with the increase of the alkyl chains length. Consequently, a high luminance of 7309 cd m−2 and current efficiency of 3.85 cd A−1 was obtained for LECs containing complex 196, where the intermolecular interactions were significantly reduced, which in turn suppressed the self-quenching. By successfully combining substituent and ancillary ligand effects in these systems, a series of interesting blue-phosphorescent Ir complexes 198–209 were subsequently synthesized, and a systematic control of the their HOMO/LUMO frontier orbitals was carried out to target complexes with large HOMO–LUMO energy gaps of −2.76 to −3.06 eV.294–296 The introduction of both fluorine and CF3 groups into the phenyl rings of the ancillary ligands shifted their emission to the blue region.295 These ligands are readily prepared via the facile iodination of difluorophenylpyridine derivatives following the synthetic pathway presented in Fig. 43.

The introduction of a methyl group into the phenyl ring of the ancillary ligand, 2-pyridyltriazolate resulted in rare, deep-blue phosphorescence at room temperature, where its emission bands were blue-shifted when compared to FIrpic.277 Efficient, deep-blue electrophosphorescence was also obtained using the charge-trapping phosphorescent complex, 198, that was doped into a range of wide-energy-gap hosts that include, diphenyldi(o-tolyl)silane (UGH1) and p-bis(triphenylsilyly)benzene (UGH2). For these systems, exciton formation was reported to occur directly on the guest molecules.294Fig. 44 illustrates the performance of OLEDs based on UGH1 and UGH2, co-deposited with complex 198 with ηext values of 8.8 and 11.6%, respectively. Following this strategy, 4-substituted-2′-pyridyltriazoles were designed to serve as ancillary ligands in addition to the main ppy ligand in the heteroleptic Ir(III) complexes 203–209, which also display deep blue phosphorescence.296 By considering the effects of the substituents on the energies of the frontier orbitals, these complexes were designed to display emissive properties in the blue region, where λmax = 448–464 nm, depending on the electronic nature of the substituents at the C-4 position of the pyridine ring of the ancillary ligand. Furthermore, the introduction of an electron-withdrawing CF3 group to the C-3 position of the phenyl ring of the ppy ligand significantly lowers the emission wavelength by 8 nm.296 A comparison of the I–V–L curves and current efficiencies of OLEDs based on complexes 207 and 198 reveals that the device based on complex 207 emits deep blue light corresponding to a CIE (0.15, 0.18), which is quite close to the ideal value of (0.15, 0.15) (Fig. 45).296 Unfortunately, the emission efficiency of this device is lower than its counterpart, complex 198. In addition to these two complexes, Ir(III) complexes incorporating a tetrazole pyridine ligand, 210 and 211, have also been developed.297 Manipulation of the molecular structures of the organic ligands, including functionalization of the cyclometalate ancillary ligands were achieved, affording phosphorescence emitters that have been used for the fabrication of blue phosphorescent OLEDs. Complexes containing 2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)-4-methylpyridine (dfmppy) and ppy were thermally more stable than their 2,4-diphenylquinoline-based counterparts. In this respect, the introduction of a methyl group into the pyridine ring of the dfmppy significantly lowers the energy of the HOMO, resulting in blue emission.

An interesting alternative to phenyl-1,2,4-triazole is the 1,4-disubstituted-1H-1,2,3-triazole ligand. These compounds are facile to prepare311,312via “click chemistry” and as a consequence, they have been widely used as cyclometalate ligands in both neutral and cationic Ir(III) complexes.313–316 Representative examples reported by Fernández-Hernández et al. are the neutral bis- and tris-cyclometalated Ir(III) complexes (212 and 213) containing 1-benzyl-4-(2,6-difluorophenyl)-1H-1,2,3-triazole (dfptrBn) ligands.298 Studies reveal that complexes fac-212 and fac-213, were emissive in both solution and thin films, with emission quantum yields of 76% and colors in the blue to blue-green region. Due to the presence of the fluorine substituents that lower their HOMO, the emission of complex fac-213 was blue-shifted compared to complex fac-212. Moreover, in both cases, the emission was blue-shifted compared to their homoleptic arylpyridine Ir(III) counterparts, fac-[Ir(ppy)3] and fac-[Ir(dfppy)3] (dfppy = 2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)pyridine).263,317 The photophysical and electrochemical properties of these complexes were further investigated by DFT calculations, which supported the experimental data.
Given their predictable band assignments, high electron affinities, high PLQY, and good thermal and chemical stabilities, 1,3,4-oxadiazole derivatives have also received considerable attention recently for applications as electroactive emissive materials. For example, four heteroleptic Ir(III) complexes, 214–217, were designed and synthesized containing cyclometalated 4-trifluoromethyl phenylpyridine, together with 2-(5-phenyl-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl)-phenol and F/CF3-substituted derivatives, as the ancillary ligands.299 The presence of two CF3 groups on the meta-positions of the phenyl ring of the ppy ancillary ligand was effective to tune the emission of the complexes towards the red region. Electrochemical studies on these complexes revealed that, although the introduction of F/CF3 groups has little effect on the energy levels of the frontier orbitals, they do however confer electrochemical stability on the Ir(III) complexes.299 This observations were further supported by DFT calculations, (Fig. 46).299

As already mentioned, an important challenge for the fabrication of full-color displays and white-light sources is the design and development of pure-blue-to-deep-blue-emitting ionic phosphors. In this respect, deep-blue emission in neutral Ir(III) complexes, 218 and 219, functionalized with substituted pyridyl cyclometalate or azolate chromophores has been achieved by using a non-conjugated phosphine ancillary ligand, containing a methylene unit as the electronic blocker.300,318 On the one hand, the π-acceptor character of the PPh2 group increases the associated metal-to-ligand charge-transfer (MLCT) energy and destabilizes the d–d excited states.299 On the other hand, the saturated nature of the PPh2 group confines the electronic transition dipole around the dfppy unit in the 2-(4,6-difluorophenyl)-4-tert-butylpyridine (dfpbpy), 5-(2-pyridyl)-3-(trifluoromethyl)pyrazole (fppz), and 3-(trifluoromethyl)-5-(2-pyridyl)-1,2,4-triazole (fptz) chromophores.299 This work opened up a new strategy for the realization of OLEDs with high-efficiency blue and true-blue phosphorescence based on complexes 218 and 219. These rarely observed properties, supported by photophysical and computational studies,300 revealed that in addition to the balance of carriers and the confinement of excitons, the development of host materials with high triplet energies are also important for high-efficiency, blue to deep-blue OLEDs. Using the non-conjugated 1-[(diphenylphosphino)methyl]-3-methylimidazolin-2-ylidene-C,C2′ (dppmmi) as the ancillary ligand, Zhang et al. reported three new cationic Ir(III) complexes, [Ir(ppy)2(dppmmi)](PF6) (220), and [Ir(dfppy)2(dppmmi)](PF6) (221) (Fig. 47).301 The dppmmi ligand bearing both PPh2 and imidazolium carbene moieties is a strong field ligand that can shift the emission of the complexes further into the blue. The non-conjugated, 2,4-difluorobenzyl-N-pyrazole (dfbpz) was used as the cyclometalated ligand for [Ir(dfbpz)2(pymbi)](PF6) (pymbi is 3-methyl-1-(2-pyridyl)benzimidazolin-2-ylidene-C,C2′), which was prepared for comparison with complexes 220, 221, and [Ir(dfppz)2(dppmmi)](PF6).

Studies reveal that pure blue to deep blue light emission at short wavelengths can be achieved by using a chromophoric ligand.301 In this respect, solution-processed OLEDs containing complexes 220 and 221 display blue-green and blue electroluminescence with λmax values of 498 and 478 nm, and maximum current efficiencies of 3.8 and 3.4 cd A−1, respectively.301 Recently, another interesting study was reported by Shavaleev et al.302 concerning complexes 222 and 223, which contain sulfur pentafluoride-modified 1-phenylpyrazole together with ppy, cyclometalate ligands. These complexes emit bright-green phosphorescence in both acetonitrile and when solution processed into thin films under ambient conditions.302 Their emission maxima range from 482 nm to 519 nm with high PLQY values between 70 and 79%.302 SF5 is a bulky, chemically inert, polar, hydrophobic, electron-withdrawing group that has been introduced into the molecular structures of cyclometalated ancillary ligands.302 Notably, SF5 is less reactive and more electron-withdrawing than F and CF3, so it increases the oxidation potential and the HOMO–LUMO gap in the resulting Ir(III) complexes. These complexes therefore display phosphorescence that is blue shifted when compared to their fluoro and CF3 counterparts. Furthermore, the bulky SF5 group enhances the solubility of the complexes, preventing close intermolecular interactions between neighboring complexes in the solid state.302 Despite these advantages, the irreversible reduction potential of SF5 can be problematic for the resulting electronic devices. For example, complexes 222 and 223 display electroluminescence in OLEDs, but not in LECs. Nevertheless, these complexes show green to yellow-green electroluminescence in doped multilayer OLEDs with CIE coordinates of (0.25–0.29, 0.44–0.54) (Fig. 48) and with ηext of up to 1.7% in the solution-processed devices.

Novel blue phosphorescent bis- and tris-cyclometalated Ir(III) complexes 227–230, bearing benzoyl substituents were also developed, where the benzoyl group was used as an electron-withdrawing substituent to target the realization of complexes with blue-shifted phosphorescence.303 The homoleptic tris-cyclometalated complex has shown the largest blue-shifted photoluminescence, emitting sky blue with a PLQY of 0.90.303 Electrochemical and DFT studies of this complex reveal that its blue-shifted PL and EL properties are mostly due to the stabilization of its HOMO.303
2.5 Homoleptic Ir(III) complexes containing ppy ligands
Highly efficient LEDs with multilayer structures were fabricated by doping the neutral, green electrophosphorescent complex [Ir(ppy)3] (231),319–321 into various electron-transport layer (ETL) hosts.258,322,323 In this respect, the search for an appropriate host material is of critical importance for the discovery of high-efficiency triplet-emitting OLED devices. For devices containing CBP electron transport layers, ηext and power efficiencies of only 8.0% and 31 lm W−1, respectively, were obtained.258 These performances were attributed to the efficient electron transfer processes involving both the singlet and triplet excited states of the Ir(ppy)3 host.258 In addition, the short phosphorescent decay time of the complex 231 decreases the saturation of the phosphor with increasing drive currents, leading to a maximum luminance of 100000 cd m−2.258 In contrast to CBP, devices fabricated from 3-phenyl-4-(1′-naphthyl)-5-phenyl-1,2,4-triazole (TAZ) hosts displayed a maximum ηext of 15.4% and a luminous power efficiency of 40 lm W−1.322 Generally, both devices have shown a gradual decrease in their quantum efficiencies with increasing current, attributed to triplet–triplet annihilation (TTA) that is present in all electrophosphorescent devices.
The synthesis and characterization of a series of highly efficient LED materials based on fluorinated organometallic Ir(III) complexes, 232–245, have also been reported. In these systems, the electroluminescence can be optimized by chemically modifying the nature and position of the substituents on the aromatic rings of their organic ligands.324 In this respect, the wavelength of the emission band of the LEDs were tuned from λmax = 500 to 595 nm by changing the position and tuning the stereo-electronics of the aforementioned substituents (Fig. 49).324 These changes are probably due to the strong π-donating effects of both F and MeO groups, which may interact with either the Ir(III) metal or the pyridine ring leading to a destabilization of the HOMO localized on the Ir metal and stabilization of the LUMO on the pyridine ligand.

Introducing bulky pinene substituents into the ppy ligand of complex 246, served to minimize bimolecular interactions that subsequently reduced self-quenching in the designed OLED.325 Complex 246 displays very strong green phosphorescence with a PLQY of 0.71 in solution and a relative short triplet lifetime of 0.33 μs in the solid state. By increasing the concentration of the complex, a gradual increase in brightness and ηext was observed, further confirming that aggregation quenching is almost negligible in the phosphorescence device.325 In addition, it was also shown that Ir(III) complexes 247–249 containing ppy ligands bearing fluorene substituents are also suitable for the fabrication of single-layer LEDs.326 The degree of conjugation of the organic ligand permits the wavelength of their emission to be tuned, and the ligand guest environment controls the degree of solid-state fluorescence quenching. The ligands in these compounds therefore provide different levels of steric protection around the metal centers,326 facilitating studies on the effect of ligand substitution patterns on their solid-state phosphorescence bulk morphology. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) studies indicate that smooth films with an average mean roughness of ca. 0.3 nm could be achieved by casting these complexes directly from toluene.326 Additionally, Gong et al. reported the first high-efficiency single-layer polymer phosphorescent light-emitting diodes (PPLEDs) containing complex 247 that was doped into a PVK:PBD matrix.327 The resulting single-layer device exhibited a ηext value of 10% and an ηp of 3 lm W−1.327 Increasing the concentration of complex 247 increased the operating voltage of the electrophosphorescence, which subsequently afforded a low ηp due to severe charge-trapping on the emitter.327 To fabricate highly efficient red-emissive OLEDs, Tsuboyama et al. prepared a series of facial homoleptic cyclometalated Ir(III) complexes 250–252, that display highly efficient (0.19–0.29) red phosphorescence.328 One of the challenges in this field is to develop new red-emissive metal complexes with large PLQY. In this respect, the introduction of substituents and/or large conjugated aromatic moieties into the framework of the organic ligands causes a shift of the wavelength emission of the OLEDs to the red compared to devices based on the unsubstituted, well-known Ir(ppy)3.328 OLEDs based on members of the Ir isoquinoline family have shown pure-red emission spectra with λmax > 620 nm.328 An OLED device containing complex 252 as the phosphorescent dopant exhibited very high electroluminescence efficiencies, as well as distinctly saturated red emission,328 which is very close to the ideal red specification proposed by the National Television Standards Committee (NTSC).328 In order shift the energy of Ir(ppy)3 from blue to red, electron-donating groups were introduced onto the pyridine ring of the ligand to decrease the energy of the HOMO. For example, functionalization of the ppy ligand with methyl groups influences both the electrochemical and photophysical properties of the resulting complex.329–332 The crystal structure and DFT calculations of complex fac-253, which contains a methyl substituted ppy ligand reveal that the non-co-planar arrangement between the phenyl and pyridine rings, very likely influences the energy of the MLCT excited state, as well as the intermolecular interactions in the solid state.329,330 A simple procedure was developed to prepare the fac and mer isomers of the novel Ir complex 254, comprising of 2-phenyl-4-methylpyridine ligands.331 The results reveal that introducing a methyl group into the para-position of the ppy ligand causes a blue-shift in the emission wavelength, further confirming that the emission color is also tunable compared to the position of the substituents in meridional isomers.331 The presence of methyl groups at various positions of the ppy ligands in complexes 255–259 has also been shown to significantly influence the absorption, emission, redox potentials and electroluminescence.332 The PLQYs of these complexes increase in the order: 235 > 236 > Ir(ppy)3 > 258 > 257 > 259. In addition, complex 256 with methyl groups at the 4- and 4′-positions has shown a significantly improved ηext, which for OLEDs was 11%, i.e., nearly 200% higher than the value obtained for the benchmark [Ir(ppy)3].332 Moreover, the addition of a tert-butyl group in complex 260 significantly suppresses the decay of the device efficiency at high current density.333 A PPLED device containing complex 260, doped with poly(2-(6-cyano-6-methyl)-heptyloxy-1,4-phenylene) (CNPPP) also possessed a larger efficiency (7.07 cd A−1 and 942 cd m−2) compared to similar devices based on Ir(ppy)3.333 This improvement is attributed to the better interaction of the guest molecules of complex 260 with the conjugated polymer host, thereby preventing phase segregation and improving the effectiveness of the energy transfer process.333 In order to gain more insight into PPLEDs, single-layer PPLEDs based on the methyl-substituted Ir complex (261) were later fabricated by appropriate thermal treatment, using efficient bilayer cathodes and a suitably modified layer composition.334 These devices show that the driving field was independent of the concentration of complex 261, which means that the build-up of space-charge due to the trapping of holes in the emissive layer is insignificant. In other words, the build-up of space-charge is mostly prevented by providing a sufficiently large number of electrons via efficient injection, transport, and recombination in optimized devices. Consequently, these devices demonstrated low diving voltages and ηp values of up to 14.1 lm W−1 (Fig. 50). Since hole injection represents the limiting process in these devices, to facilitate hole injection, Yang et al. studied devices with a single cross-linked hole-transporting layer comprising of (X-HTL) QUPD (N4,N4′-bis(4-((6-((3-ethyloxetan-3-yl)methoxy)hexyl)oxy)phenyl)-N4,N4′-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)-[1,1′-biphenyl]-4,4′-diamine).335 The introduction of X-HTL double layers together with a bis-spirobifluorene host doped with the soluble green emitter 262, resulted in a three-fold efficiency increase, when compared to devices without X-HTL, while maintaining the low driving voltage and stable green emission.336 The authors concluded that the X-HTL concept is able to significantly increase the power efficiency of blue-light-emitting electrophosphorescent devices.336

According to Samuel et al., Ir-based phosphorescent dendrimers can be highly efficient light-emitting materials for OLEDs.337–339,341,342,344,345,352,353 Light-emitting dendrimers comprise of surface groups, dendrons, and cores. Their modular construction permits their processability and electronic properties to be independently tuned, tolerating a wide range of chromophores, which in many cases would be unsuitable for isolated use, or exist as the repeat unit of a polymer.337 A methodology for the preparation of solution-processible dendrimers, 263 and 264, with fac-tris(ppy)Ir-cores was developed by Markham et al.337 The resulting compounds were fabricated into single layer OLEDS via spin coating techniques that display very-high-efficiency green phosphorescence.337 The high efficiency is attributed to the uniform nature of the film, as well as the high PLQY of the dendrimer blend, and the efficient injection of charges at the anode and cathode.337 Very high efficiencies were also achieved for two-layer OLEDs that contained a similar dendrimer layer comprising of complex 263, together with a second hole-blocking/electron-transporting layer.338 For the device configuration ITO/263/BCP/LiF/Al, an average ηp of 8 lm W−1, at a brightness of 1065 cd m−2 (12 V) was obtained.338 The efficiencies of the two-layer devices are extraordinarily high at a useable brightness (17 cd A−1 and 16000 cd m−2) and are representative of those reported for more complex device architectures with high PLQYs.338 A high PLQY suggests that the dendrimer guest is evenly distributed throughout the emissive film.338 However, to realize highly efficient devices it is necessary to blend the dendrimers together with a suitable host.352 In order to examine the key role of the host, a first-generation light-emitting dendrimer (265) was designed.339 In this dendrimer identical building blocks were assembled into a macromolecular structure, significantly decreasing the interactions between the light-emitting Ir(ppy)3-cores.339 Studies of this system have shown that eliminating detrimental intermolecular interactions in the thin film does not compromise its charge transport properties.339 Highly branched dendrons have the potential to control intermolecular interactions and organize the surface groups, which play an important role in enhancing the physical properties of the dendrimer 267.341–343 The solution phase electrochemiluminescence of dendrimer 266 was found to be significantly improved when contained within the core of the dendrimer vs. the simple parent Ir(ppy)3 complex, despite the lower PLQY of the dendrimer.340 These properties are promising for the future applications of dendrimers as light-emitting materials in host-free devices. The presence of fluorene surface groups on dendrimer 268 enhance the solubility, as well as the efficiency of photoluminescence in the solid state.342 When fabricated into bilayer LEDs, dendrimer 267, without surface groups has a ηext of 10%, whereas ηext = 13% for dendrimer 268.342 The highly branched non-conjugated tetrahedral tetraphenylsilane dendrons around the Ir(ppy)3-core of dendrimer 269 also effectively inhibit intermolecular interactions between the core units in the films.343 In this respect, the dendritic structures provide a powerful and systematic way of controlling intermolecular interactions within the thin films, which decreases the rate of PL quenching.354 Studies on triplet–triplet annihilation were also carried out in neat films of electrophosphorescent dendrimers with [Ir(ppy)]-cores. The optical properties of phenylene- (263 and 264) and carbazole-based (270) dendrons have been studied by time-resolved photoluminescence.345 The photoluminescence emission for the Ir–carbazole complex 270 was slightly red-shifted at λmax ∼ 530 nm, when compared to dendrimers 263 and 264, due to its enhanced electron delocalization.345 The results reveal that the triplet–triplet annihilation constants varies in the range of 5–200 × 10−14 cm3 s−1, while the exciton diffusion lengths varies in the 2–10 nm, depending on the size of the dendrons.345 Furthermore, the emissive and charge transport properties of dendrimers 263 and 264 can be modified by the location and size of the dendritic arms. For this purpose, a novel para-appended first-generation Ir dendrimer 266 was studied.355 The emission of the dendrimer was red-shifted by 17 nm when compared to dendrimers 263 and 264 to give yellow-green emission with λmax = 535 nm, due to the extended conjugation of the ligand chromophore attached to the Ir(III) cation. Unfortunately, dendrimer 266 had a lower efficiency relative to the meta linked dendrimers 263 and 264, probably because of its lower PLQY.355 The same researchers have also developed a convergent synthetic strategy for the preparation of solution-processible green phosphorescent Ir(III) dendrimers with first- 270 and second-generation 271 dendrons, containing one and two carbazole units, respectively.344 Differential scanning calorimetry has shown that the glass-transition temperature (Tg) of dendrimer 270 was significantly higher than that of its first-generation, phenylene-based counterpart dendrimer 263, which is due to its higher molecular mass and the rigidity of its molecular structure. No Tg was detected within the limits of the experiment for dendrimer 271, due to its high molecular weight and large number of carbazole moieties. The PLQYs of neat films comprising of first- and second-generation dendrimers were significantly higher than those reported for phenylene-derived dendrimers.344 This improvement is ascribed to the increased steric demand of the carbazole unit relative to the phenyl ring, which reduces intermolecular interactions more effectively, causing the cores to be less emissive.344 Additionally, thin film hole mobilities of dendrimer 270 were found to be higher than those of its phenylene-based counterpart dendrimer 271.344 Two green and yellow-green multi-functional phosphorescent dendrimers 272 and 273 were also reported containing dendrons based on charge-transporting building blocks and a phosphorescent core.346 The use of non-conjugated alkyl chains to bridge the carbazole moieties increases the solubility of these compounds, preventing a decrease in their triplet energies. The current for a given voltage was higher in the OLED containing neat dendrimer 272versus OLEDs fabricated from Ir(ppy)3 core and phenylene-based dendrons, since the hole-transporting dendrons improve the hole drift mobility of the dendrimer. OLEDs fabricated with a blend film of dendrimer 272 together with the electron-transporting compound 1,3-bis[5-(4-tert-butylphenyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazole-2-yl]benzene (OXD-7) exhibit a high ηext of 7.6%, which was better than the maximum value of 5.2% for the device prepared
from dendrimer 273, most likely due to the location of the recombination site.346 Other studies concerned the synthesis and characterization of highly phosphorescent cyclometalated Ir(III) complexes with silane-based dendritic substituents (269 and 274–276).343,347–349 The tetrahedral configuration of the aryl substituents appended to the silicon atoms may provide a site-isolation effect if directly introduced as substituents onto the organic ligands of the Ir(III) complex. Furthermore, the highly efficient UV emission of aryl silanes suggests that they should have improved emission efficiencies when compared to their alkyl counterparts for OLED applications.356,357 As expected, studies confirm that the triphenylsilyl dendritic substituents play a key role in shielding the emissive Ir(ppy)3 core of the molecule from undesirable non-radiative pathways, without changing its emissive properties.347 Additionally, the introduction of triarylsilyl substituents affords high chemical stability and better solubilities that improves overall device performance.347 Despite these advantages, triarylsilyl groups also have major drawbacks that include low yields, difficult syntheses and low vapor pressures. In contrast, their trimethylsilyl counterparts are easily introduced into the ligand backbone that can be subsequently derivatized in high yields. In this respect, the combination of ppy together with trimethylsilyl substituents is a practical approach to achieve efficient phosphorescent emitters. In fact, studies reveal that the presence of trimethylsilyl functional groups confer very high thermal stabilities, good solubilities in common organic solvents, higher vapor pressures, and a higher volume of steric bulk.348 Ir(III) complexes containing trimethylsilyl groups also display yellow-green electroluminescence and significantly improved power efficiency when compared to Ir(ppy)3 devices, under the same conditions.348 Extending this concept, the introduction of bulky trimethylsilylxylene substituents onto the ppy ligand of the Ir-based complex 276 affords a device with ηext of 12.7%, which could be useful for the fabrication of white OLEDs for lighting applications.349 This improvement can at least in part be attributed to the increased steric bulk of the ligand, which hinders aggregation in the solid state at concentrations of 6% 276 doped into CBP.
Ir(ppy)3 derivatives as new types of phosphorescent materials containing hole-trapping diphenylamine (277), carbazole (278), phenoxazine (279), and phenothiazine (280) moieties, have also been synthesized in the search for effective methods for carrier injection into the phosphor of organic EL devices.350 Their PL maxima were found to be close to that of Ir(ppy)3, but slightly red and blue-shifted, depending on the electron donating/withdrawing nature of their respective substituents. In this respect, the presence of diphenylamine and phenoxazine groups increased the electron-donating ability of the Ir(ppy)3, while the carbazole unit caused a more unstable oxidation state. Among these complexes, EL devices containing complex 277 have shown a high EL performance with a maximum ηext of 12.2%,350 which is comparable to the values obtained with Ir(ppy)3.350 A representative example was also reported by Bolink et al., comprising of the novel cationic Ir(III) complex 281. By introducing positively charged, electron withdrawing side-groups onto the periphery of the ppy ligands,351 the emission of the complex was blue-shifted of ∼35 nm compared to Ir(ppy)3. Consequently, complex 281 emits bluish-green light, which is extremely appealing for future LED applications.
3 Pt(II) complexes containing 2-phenylpyrdiine ligands
Square-planar Pt(II) complexes have attracted much attention over recent years, due to their versatile spectroscopic properties. In contrast to Ir(III) complexes with octahedral geometries, square-planar Pt(II) complexes exhibit not only emission from ligand-centered (3LC) and/or 3MLCT states, but also tend to form stacked or dimeric structures, stabilized by Pt–Pt and/or π–π interactions that can be fairly problematic for their applications in real devices. A new approach for the fabrication of white OLEDS or WOLEDs, combines the monomer and excimer phosphorescence of the two emitters 282 and FIrpic, co-doped into a single emissive layer.358 This approach significantly simplifies the structure of the device without compromising efficiency. Continuing this study, efficient white electrophosphorescence was achieved by using the single emissive dopant, 283, which emits simultaneously from both monomer and aggregate states.359,360 Single dopant WOLEDs may solve the problems associated with differential dopant aging, while at the same time reducing the complexity of the device.359 In this respect, WOLEDs that utilize multiple dopants often change color over time due to differences in the degradation rates of each dopant.358 All dopant molecules are based on a series of P(II) β-diketonates.359 Increasing the degree of steric bulk of the Pt complex can cause a separation between the square-planar emissive molecules, as well as increase the solubility of the complexes, permitting their more uniform dispersal in the host matrix. For WOLEDs doped with complex 282, their EL spectra are dominated by an orange broad-band emission at λmax ∼ 590 nm, with minor peaks at ∼470 and ∼500 nm, attributed to the emission of the monomers.359 According to an extensive theoretical study,361 the Pt–Pt bimetallic interaction between adjacent molecules is a necessary condition to significantly shift the emission of these complexes to the red. As shown in Fig. 51, although all devices fabricated complex from 282 show both monomer and excimer emission, the relative intensities of the peaks vary.360 Moreover, in the absence of the Pt–Pt interactions, other types of intermolecular contacts e.g., Pt–π and π–π interactions, do not lead to such significant shifts in the PL spectra.362 Subsequent studies by Chen et al., describe the synthesis, characterization, and crystal structures of a family of new Pt(II) complexes, comprising of 3-aryl-substituted acac auxiliary ligands, 284–286.362 The PL spectrum of complex 286 possesses only a broad low-energy band at λmax = 605 nm, due to the presence of Pt–Pt interactions. In contrast, thin films prepared from the four complexes 282 and 284–286, display low-energy broad-band emissions of different wavelengths, depending on the fraction of Pt–Pt dimers that are present in the complexes. The ηext, as well as the current and power efficiency of non-doped devices based on these complexes decreases in the order 285 > 286 > 284 > 282. The higher efficiency of the non-doped device based on 285 is attributed to minor amounts of Pt–Pt dimers, that reduces self-quenching. Multi-functional Pt-derivatized random terpolymers assembled from monomers comprising of hole-transporting, electron-transporting, and emissive modules, 287–290, have also been prepared and investigated.363 These metallopolymers are stable in air, soluble in organic solvents and emit simultaneously in the blue and orange regions from both monomer and aggregate states.363 In addition to the intrinsic structural features of the polymer, the concentration of the Pt complex largely controls the extent of Pt–Pt interactions within the material.363 All devices fabricated from these polymers appear nearly white to the naked eye (pure white is x = 0.33, y = 0.33).363 Moreover, norbornene-derivatized platinum complexes, 291–294, comprising of 9,9-dialkyl-2,7-di-(carbazol-9-yl)fluorene monomers were synthesized and further copolymerized.364 Studies on these systems proved that excimer/aggregate emission from the platinum complexes are transferred to the EL spectra of light-emitting devices based on copolymers. Another interesting study was reported by Yang et al., using emissive platinum complexes containing carbazole moieties that are covalently attached to polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS) cores, 295–297.365 The POSS macromolecules containing chromophores and carrier-transporting moieties benefit from containing both small-molecule and polymer light-emitting materials in that they can be isolated in high purity and are solution processible. The aim of linking carbazole and platinum-complex moieties onto the same POSS core is to effectively dilute the concentration of the platinum complex within the single molecule, thereby adjusting the monomer and excimer/aggregate emission. Increasing the amount of carbazole moieties, as in complex 295vs. complex 296, improves the emission of the monomer in the solid state. OLEDs based on POSS materials displayed a maximum ηext value of ∼8%,365 which was significantly higher than that of similar devices containing a physical blend of the platinum complex together with a polymer matrix.365 The enhanced efficiency of POSS-based devices is ascribed to the reduced aggregation of the square planar Pt complexes and subsequent decrease in quenching at higher concentrations. Additionally, the ratio of monomer to excimer/aggregate emission intensity decreases as the concentration of the Pt complex in the POSS macromolecules increases, leading to variations in CIE coordinates from (0.46, 0.44) to (0.48, 0.48) to (0.53, 0.46), for devices containing complexes 296, 295, and 297, respectively. In a study published in 2005, the π–π stacking of mono-cyclometalated Pt(II) complexes 298–300 was prevented by increasing the steric bulk of the second auxiliary ligand in complexes bearing the same cyclometalated phenyl–pyridine ligand.366 This complexes are separated by intermolecular distances greater than 3.8 Å that does not completely eliminate interactions between neighboring Pt complexes in the solid-state, but does shift the emission wavelength of their solid-state electroluminescence spectra, to higher energies, i.e. λmax = 540 nm.366 In this respect, an efficient LED based on complex 299 displays green electroluminescence with an efficiency of 6 cd A−1.366 Other representative examples of this family of compounds are the trifunctional Pt(II) cyclometalated complexes proposed by Wong et al.367,368 In these systems, hole-transporting triarylamine, electron-transporting oxadiazole, and electroluminescent Pt(II) complexes are all combined within a single compound, 301–306.367,368 To understand the photophysics and electrochemistry of these multi-functional systems, their properties are compared to devices prepared from their constituent components. Hence devices prepared from complexes 305 and 306 were also studied, revealing that the Pt(II) chelates display good thermal (>250 °C under N2) and morphological stabilities. Furthermore, these complexes can also be vacuum-sublimed for applications as the emissive components of vapor-deposited electrophosphorescent OLEDs.367 The oxidation potentials of complexes 301–304 slightly decrease according to the following trend 301 > 302 > 303 > 304, which is attributed to the inductive effect of their R substituents.367

In addition to PL, electrofluorescence also depends on the electronic nature of the substituents, whereas electrophosphorescence energy is independent of R. Based on DFT studies, the HOMO of these complexes is located on the diarylamino groups, while the LUMO is localized on the π* orbitals of the oxadiazole heterocycle.368 Devices fabricated from complex 303 achieved excellent performances, with efficiencies up to 3.6%, 11.0 cd A−1, and 5.8 lm W−1.368 These results are presumably reached because of the better matching of the HOMO levels of their emissive complex with the NPB (hole-transport layer), which serves to afford an excellent balance between holes and electrons in the resulting device.368 Unfortunately, complexes 305 and 306 did not form good-quality films for devices fabrication. The physical and multi-functional properties of complex 301 also rendered it suitable for the fabrication of simple, small-molecule based device architectures.367,368 In this respect, the device ITO/CuPc/301/Ca/Al exhibited strong orange-yellow EL at λmax = 538 nm and 578 nm, with a low Von of 6 V. The device displays a maximum luminous efficiency of 1.2 cd A−1 and a luminance of 1065 cd m−2 at 14 V. The EL spectra of the OLED reveal no significant changes as the operating bias voltage was varied, a clear signature of a better performance compared to the more complex, multilayered device fabricated from 2-phenylpyridine.367,368 This study also highlights that strong interactions between emissive molecules appended to the triphenylamino moieties and the fluorene rings of 307 are very effective at overcoming triplet–triplet annihilation.369
In the following studies, a new series of Pt bearing triphenylene and carbazole substituents, 308–311, were designed and synthesized.370 To explore the structure–property relationships in these compounds, the linkers between the triphenylene and the Pt(II) moieties were varied from alkyl to aryl.370 Upon optical excitation, the excimer emission is effectively inhibited in these compounds due to the presence of peripheral side chains and additional carbazole units.370 Ho et al. reported a new series of Pt(II) cyclometalated complexes 312–321, in which electroluminescent Pt(II) complexes and hole-transporting carbazole substituents are integrated within a single molecule.371 The majority of these complexes were characterized by X-ray crystallography, demonstrating thermal stabilities with decomposition temperatures ranging from 234 to 350 °C.371 Based on electrochemical studies, it has been established that the addition of electron-withdrawing substituents such as a fluorine in complex 316, and a trifluoromethyl group in complex 315, stabilizes the LUMO levels, while electron-donating groups such as the methyl group in complex 317, destabilizes the LUMO level compared to the unsubstituted derivative (312).371 The energy of the LUMOs of these complexes therefore decreases in the order 217 > 312 > 316 > 315. The substituents on the phenyl ring of the carbazole moiety of these complexes had no effect on their redox properties. The excited-state properties of these complexes could be controlled by varying the electronic nature of the cyclometalate ligands. In this respect, functionalization of the organic ligands with the appropriate substituents allowed the emissive properties of the resulting compounds to be tuned from bright green, to yellow, orange and red light. Solution-processed electrophosphorescent OLEDs doped with phosphors based on complex 315 presented a maximum efficiency, ηext of 2.77%, corresponding to a power efficiency of 3.48 lm W−1 and a luminance of 8.49 cd A−1. The EL spectra of the device based on complex 315, slightly changes as a function of the concentration of the dopant due to excimer formation.371 More importantly, the emission caused by aggregation or π–π stacking was considerably weaker for devices containing complex 315, especially at high doping concentrations, when compared to the non-trifluoromethylated complexes 313 and 314. This is likely due to the presence of a bulky CF3 group, which alters the molecular packing and minimizes self-quenching behavior.371 Additionally, a pair of Pt(II) enantiomers 322, bearing sterically hindered chiral pinene substituents were also reported, displaying both lower self-quenching and triplet–triplet annihilation.372
The syntheses as well as the photo- and electroluminescence properties of novel Pt-containing copolymers prepared by the ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) of norbornene monomers were also investigated.383–386 This approach produced co-polymer materials that contain both hole transporting carbazole groups and emissive cyclometalated Pt(II) complexes that are anchored via a range of β-diketonates.373 Copolymers 323–325 were strongly emissive both in solution and the solid state, suggesting that the platinum complexes directly attached to a polymer chain are sufficiently isolated, preventing aggregate formation and excimer emission.373 Among these manufactured copolymers, the highest brightness was observed for a device based on 325, in which the cyclometalated Pt(II) complex is anchored by a pyrazolonate group.373
PhOLEDs with high ηext were demonstrated for the first time using the cyclometalated Pt(II) complex 326 bearing a bulky triarylboron group that prevented intermolecular π-to-π stacking and excimer formation.374 Moreover, the acetylacetonate ancillary ligand provides good solution and solid-state stabilities, possessing a high energy triplet state to ensure efficient phosphorescence from the boryl chromophore. Using this complex as the electrophosphor, a simplified green Pt(II)-based PhOLED, with a maximum ηext of 21% was obtained.374 Also, the orientation of the transition dipole moments of fluorescent molecules in OLEDs parallel to the substrate was simply enhances ηext by up to 45% compared with that containing randomly oriented molecules. Moreover, Pt(II) complexes were more suited to accepting horizontal orientation due to their square planar geometry.375 Hence, an OLED comprising of the linear-shaped Pt(II) complex 327 that adopts a horizontal orientation was synthesized displaying a maximum ηext of 15.8%.375 In order to suppress aggregation and excimer emission, the carbazole-modified green-emitting Pt(II) complex 328 was developed, containing a carbazole moiety, together with three hexadecyloxy methyl substituents on the parent ppy ligand.376 As previously mentioned, the carbazole unit is widely used as both a HT and emissive material in the field of OLEDs. Hexadecyloxy methyl groups were introduced to improve the dispersibility of this complex in the host matrix.376 Complex 328 displays good thermal stability and affords a PLQY that is three-time higher than its parent [(ppy)Pt(acac)] complex.376 Results from CV studies indicate that the incorporation of carbazole and hexadecyloxy methyl units into the ppy-based ligand, increases the energies of HOMO and LUMO frontier orbitals of the Pt(II) complex. At different dopant concentrations and applied voltages, aggregation and excimer emission were also effectively suppressed in devices doped with complex 328. In these devices, a maximum current efficiency of 1.51 cd A−1 was obtained, which is a 1.5 increase over [(ppy)Pt(acac)]. In addition to mononuclear complexes, numerous photoluminescence studies have also been carried out on multinuclear Pt(II) complexes.377,378,387–390 For example, Wang et al. probed the impact of molecular structure on the emissive properties of bi- and tri-nuclear organoplatinum complexes containing 2,2′-dipyridylamino ligands.387 In this respect, the dinuclear Pt(II) complex 329, comprising of a blend of monomolecular and excimer emission was prepared.377 OLED devices doped with complex 329 exhibited stable, white emission,377 whereas their (dfppy)Pt(pic)-doped mononuclear counterpart afforded orange-red emission.377 To further improve the solubility of dinuclear Pt(II) complexes and investigate the relationship between molecular structure and excimer emission,377 two dinuclear cyclometalated Pt(II) complexes (330 and 331), bearing long-dodecyloxy chains together with dipicolinic acid substituents were prepared and studied.378 In the presence of an applied electric field, doped single-emissive-layer PLEDs containing these Pt(II) complexes possess strong emission attributed to the single molecules rather than excimer emission, due to the presence of the two alkyloxy groups. Both dinuclear Pt(II) complexes exhibited intense UV-vis absorption and emission bands in solution. Improved electroluminescent emission with maximum current efficiencies of 1.3 cd A−1 and a maximum luminance of 1407 cd cm−2 was obtained for devices doped with complex 330.
Tsujimoto et al. developed a series of (CN)Pt(O,O′)-type complexes (332 and 333) that contain bdbp ancillary ligands, together with 2-(dibenzo[b,d]furan-4-yl)pyridinate (dbfp).391 These complexes were subsequently used for the fabrication of polymer-based LEDs that displayed a maximum ηext of 1.8% at 9.5 V and a brightness of 1845 cd m−2.392 To clarify the effect of the ancillary ligand on excimer formation in heteroleptic cyclometalated Pt(II) complexes, the same researchers investigated excimer-based PL and EL properties of the green-phosphorescent complexes 332 and 333, with bdbp and dpm (dipivaloylmethanate) ancillary ligands, respectively.379 In polymer thin films and PLEDs doped with complex 332, a red-shifted photoluminescence band at λmax > 600 nm, consistent with excimer emission was observed, together with bands at λmax = 516 and 552 nm, attributed to the emission of the monomer, which increased in intensity with the concentration of the dopant.379 Although films doped with complex 333 provided quite modest excimer-based photoluminescence, the relative intensity of the monomer emission was also much lower when compared to complex 332.379 This ancillary ligand effect is due to the considerable stacking-enhancing ability of bdbp. Normalized EL spectra and photographs of emitting PLEDs as the doping level of complex 332 is increased for devices A–D and the doping level of complex 333 is increased for devices A′–D′ are shown in Fig. 52. In this respect, as the doping levels in PLEDs containing complex 332 were increased from 7.1 to 24 wt%, the excimer-based EL shifts from green to orange, whereas for complex 333, the doping effect is much less remarkable, Fig. 52(b). Referring to CIE chromaticity coordinates, color tuning was possible for complex 332, with CIE values ranging from (0.40, 0.57) to (0.56, 0.43).379 It is also interesting to note that the efficient triplet excimer formation in PLEDs prepared from complex 332 originate from the direct charge recombination of anion and cation radicals that are generated by electron and hole injection.379 In order to develop systems that have more efficient monomer and excimer emission, a second family of dbfp-based cyclometalated Pt(II) complexes 334–339, were subsequently targeted.380 In later studies, electron donating and withdrawing substituents (F, CH3, and CF3) were introduced into the dbfp cyclometalated ligand framework to study their effects on the quantum yields and colors of the resulting complexes.380 These studies reveal that substitution at the 4-position of the dbfp ligand significantly improves the emission efficiencies of this family of Pt(II) complexes in polymer media.380 Furthermore, PLEDs doped with the methyl-substituted complex had relatively high device efficiencies. Among these complexes, complex 335 was sufficiently soluble in organic solvents to be fabricated into PLEDs at high doping levels.

In order to improve the thermal stability and performance of the electrophosphorescent devices, two functionalized Pt(II)-based triplet emitters (340 and 341) were later developed with a flexible phenoxy group on the ppy ligand, which improves the morphology of the emissive layer due to the flexible nature of the oxygen linker.381 Because of their special excimer emission, a wide range of colors from cyan to orange were observed as the concentration of the Pt(II) complex is increased.
A series of Pt(II) complexes, 342–345, with a tpip ancillary ligand were also synthesized to study the substitution effects of CF3 groups.382 From this work,382 it is apparent that a CF3 group on C3 of the ligand causes a hypsochromic shift in the emission of complex 343, whereas a CF3 groups on C2 and C4 leads to a bathochromic shift in complexes 342 and 344, respectively. Among these complexes, complex 343 displays a maximum luminance of over 39000 cd m−2, accompanied by current and power efficiencies of 41.0 cd A−1 and 31.0 lm W−1, respectively. Considering all of the devices prepared and studied to-date it is apparent that the best OLEDs are based on rare metal complexes containing ppy and polypyridyl ligands, with EQE values >10%, and are typically green emitters, Fig. 53. In this respect, complex 154 has the highest EQE value reported to-date of more than 25%.

4 Third-generation OLEDs: TADFs
4.1 Introduction: TADF based on Cu(I) complexes
Cu(I) complexes containing polypyridyl ligands have been met with great interest since they are relatively inexpensive to prepare and comprise of abundant first row transition metal ions, which makes them attractive replacements to the rare metal polypyridyl complexes previously described.88,178,393,394 In early studies, Buckner and McMillin observed that Cu(I) polypyridyl complexes display metal to ligand charge transfer (MLCT) based luminescence due to the d10 electronic configuration of the Cu(I) ion, providing high PLQY in both solution and solid films.395–399 Over the past decade studies have revealed that most TADF Cu(I) metal complexes, which show promise for OLED applications, contain polypyridyl ligands.400–409 In fact, in analogy with the Ir-based systems, the use of polypyridyl ligands provides a strategy to optimize the emission properties of OLEDs, since emission often arises from the MLCT state.410 To the best of our knowledge, the EQEs of OLEDs based on Cu(I) TADFs are now exceeding 23%, which is comparable to the efficiency of OLEDs based on the Ir(III) emitters, indicating a bright future for this new generation of OLEDs.411 Despite this promise, the widely-recognized disadvantage of Cu(I) polypyridyl complexes are their long lifetimes, that are typically in the range of several hundred microseconds,412 attributed to weak spin–orbit coupling (SOC), resulting in low radiative rates for the T1 → S0 transitions.402,413 Nevertheless, in reverse intersystem crossing (RISC), low SOC conditions are possible, with the population of T1 that may be thermally transferred to the S1 excitons for light generation. The small energy separation between lowest excited singlet (S1) and triplet states (T1) in Cu(I) complexes may therefore permit the thermal activation of excitons from T1 to S1 and then the subsequent transfer of energy from the S1 → S0 transition becomes effectively a radiative channel for light emission. In reality, the low SOC in Cu(I) polypyridine complexes is now more commonly referred to as TADF.414–416 In fact, TADF is now considered to be a major breakthrough for OLED technology, which makes these compounds very promising for the development of highly efficient third generation OLEDs.404,417,418 As a consequence, many organic and non-metal TADF compounds have been reported in recent years, which have been the subject of several reviews, and thus are not within the scope of this article.112,113,419–422 In contrast, however, the progress of TADF-OLEDs based on metal–polypyridyl complexes has not been intensively reviewed to-date and thus is the focus of the next section of this review paper. Considering the importance of blue emission in the field of OLEDs, the synthesis and characterization of a series of cationic cuprous complexes with green-blue to blue emission comprised of (POP = bis[2-(diphenylphosphino)phenyl]ether) and N-linked 2-pyridyl pyrazolate diimine ligands, [Cu(pypz)(POP)](BF4) (346), [Cu(pympz)(POP)](BF4) (347), and [Cu(pytfmpz)(POP)](BF4) (348)408 (where pypz = 1-(2-pyridyl)pyrazole; pympz = 3-methyl-1-(2-pyridyl)pyrazole, and pytfmpz = 3-trifluoromethyl-1-(2-pyridyl)pyrazole) has been reported.329 It now well established that the best strategy to obtain blue emission is to chemically tune the HOMO–LUMO energy gap423 of the coordination complexes. In this respect, pypz ligands are selected for their electron-donating properties which destabilize the LUMO energy levels of luminescent dopants, thereby increasing the HOMO–LUMO energy gaps, and therefore shifting the emission of their resulting complexes to the blue.329 In addition, it is worth noting that various substituents on the pyrazole rings of pypz ligands can be introduced to modulate their emission efficiencies and colors. Another remarkable phenomenon found in these complexes is the correlation of the emission decay time with the spectroscopic properties as a function of the temperature, due to the relatively small energy gap between their singlet and triplet states.329 In this way, low-temperature phosphorescence (LTP) and high-temperature thermally activated delayed fluorescence (HT-TADF).329 The two phenomena are present with emission decay times that are dramatically reduced from hundreds to about ten microseconds as the temperature is increased.329 When these complexes are used as dopants in different hosts for the fabrication of solution-processed OLEDs, efficiencies up to 23.68 cd A−1 and a peak brightness of 2033 cd cm−2 were obtained for complex 348 doped into 2,6-bis(N-carbazolyl)pyridine (2,6-mCPy).329 This high value is attributed to the “adequate” confinement of the triplet excitons and charge carriers.329 However, the low efficiencies of the OLEDs based on complexes 346 and 347 are attributed to the approximately equal LUMO energy levels of the host mCPy and the 346 or 347 dopants.329 In order to modify TADF in Cu(I) complexes, a NHetPHOS complex containing a butterfly-shaped Cu2I2 unit coordinated by two ancillary phosphine ligands and bridged by an N,P-ligand, complex 349, was reported.411 This compound is air stable and has a lower triplet energies ΔE(T1–S0) of up to 200 meV compared to other green-emitting Cu(I) compounds.396 Another advantage of this binuclear Cu-complex is its high thermal stability (Tdecomp = 290 °C) due the four-fold bridging of its Cu(I) centers. This multi-bridged binuclear Cu(I) complex lends itself well to OLED applications because of its well-defined structure, good processability, high PLQY in PYD2-doped films and low triplet energy, due to the singlet harvesting mechanism.411 In fact, for OLEDs containing complex 349, a high EQE value of 23% was obtained, which is the highest value reported to date for OLEDs fabricated from either vacuum or solution processed emissive layers of Cu(I) complexes. More importantly, this value is comparable to best efficiencies reported for state-of-the-art vacuum sublimed devices based on Ir(III) emitters. The former device shows a pronounced roll-off of the current efficiency with increasing luminance due to a loss of charge balance, most likely since most of the hole transport does not occur via the host material, but via the emitter itself. Nevertheless, it is apparent that this multi-bridged binuclear Cu(I) complex paves the way for the future development of new families of very efficient OLEDs.
In parallel studies, two blue-green Cu(I) complexes [Cu(PNNA)(POP)](BF4) (350) and [Cu(PNNA)(Xantphos)](BF4) (351) were prepared comprising of a functional diimine and the phosphine ligands, PNNA = 9,9-dimethyl-10-(6-(3-phenyl-1H-pyrazol-1-yl)pyridin-3-yl)-9,10-dihydroacridine, and POP = bis[2-(dipenylphosphino)phenyl]ether, Xantphos = 4,5-bis-(diphenylphosphino)-9,9-dimethylxanthene.424 The luminescence properties of these complexes are attributed to two inter-convertible excited states that are in thermal equilibrium, i.e., S1 and T1 at 293 and 77 K respectively. It is interesting to note that increasing the steric hindrance of the ligands increases the PLQYs. In these cuprous complexes it is noteworthy that a 9,9-dimethylacridan donor substituent was subsequently appended to their diimine ligands due to superior hole-transport ability. In most cuprous complexes, luminescence is caused by a metal to ligand charge transfer (MLCT) transition, but in complexes containing a functional dimethylacridine moiety an ILCT-based luminescence is observed. Finally, the highest efficiency, brightness and best blue electroluminescence was observed for a device with complex 351 as the dopant, which is attributed to the presence of its bulky, rigid ligands.
In 2017, Ling and co-workers began systematic studies on three green emissive binuclear cuprous complexes.176 In these complexes tetraimine derivatives together with the bisphosphine ligands (pytzph = 6,6′-(1-phenyl-1,2,4-triazole-3,5-diyl)bis(2-methylpyridine), pytzphcf = 6,6′-(1-(4-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)-1,2,4-triazole-3,5-diyl)bis-(2-methylpyridine), pytzphcz = 9-(4-(3,5-bis(6-methylpyridin-2-yl)-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)phenyl)-carbazole and POP = bis[2-(diphenylphosphine)phenyl]ether), were used to prepare the corresponding cationic cuprous complexes, [Cu2(pytzph)(POP)2](BF4)2 (352), [Cu2(pytzphcf)(POP)2](BF4)2 (353) and [Cu2(pytzphcz)(POP)2](BF4)2 (354).176 It is notable that the contributions to the emission from the S1 and T1 states differ as a function of the temperature. In this respect, below 90 K, the intensity contribution from the phosphorescence increases but as the temperature increases, the emission from the S1 state via TAD increases in intensity. At room temperature in the solid state, these complexes exhibit highly efficient green TADF due to the small activation energy ΔEST, which causes the lower energy T1 excitons to convert gradually into the S1 state through reverse intersystem crossing by thermal activation, decreasing the radiative lifetime. Complex 354 containing a carbazole moiety shows the highest device efficiency for the solution-processed OLEDs. This behavior can be attributed to its high PLQY and the excellent hole transporting abilities of the carbazole group, whereas the presence of the electron-withdrawing CF3 group in complex 353 results in a poorer quantum efficiency. Given that sterically bulky carborane containing ligands display superior properties such as (i) thermal stability,428 (ii) unique electronic effects, (iii) ability to tune the HOMO and LUMO (iv) intermolecular interactions, (v) high photoluminescent PLQY,429–432 (vi) hydrophilicity433–437 and (vii) concentration quenching behavior,438–440 Gary et al. proposed three cationic Cu(I) complexes, 355–357, bearing dppnc (7,8-bis(diphenylphosphino)-7,8-dicarba-nido-undecaborate) and neocuproine ligands. Studies of these systems reveal that by modifying the structure of the neuquoperine, the emission color could be adjusted from green to deep red.425 The unique molecular and electronic structures of these complexes are understood and have been correlated to their photo-physical properties by DFT calculations.425 The most important conclusion from this study is that the efficiency and emission color of cuprous complexes can be strongly influenced by both T1 energy levels of the host material. Solution-processed OLEDs were fabricated from the aforementioned cuprous complexes and all show the TADF mechanism.425 Maximum EQEs of 18.46, 14.30, and 10.17% were obtained in the green, yellow and red region for Cu(dppnc)-G (355), Cu(dppnc)-Y (356) and Cu(dppnc)-R (357), respectively, see Fig. 54. Furthermore, the performance of these devices with dopant concentrations ranging from 4 to 20 wt% were recorded and are summarized in Table 9. Pure red emission with an EQE of 10.17%, was achieved for the device comprising of 4 wt% of the Cu(dppnc)-R emitter doped into a CBP host, which represents the highest efficiency reported for a red Cu-OLED to date.441–444 The first examples of TADF-OLEDs based on lanthanide polypyridyl complexes were prepared to overcome the difficulties associated with the development of red OLEDs.

In this respect, the europium complex, tris(dibenzoylmethane)mono(1,10-phenanthroline)Eu(III), (Eu(DBM)3Phen), 358, was prepared.426 This complex afforded red OLEDs with narrow, sharp emissions attributed to 5D0 → 7F2 transitions of the 4f ion.367 These complexes are characterized as TADF OLEDs due to the small energy gap (ΔEST) between the S1 and T1 states that facilitates efficient triplet reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) and reduces non-radiative decay. It is worth noting that in complex 338, the 4f ion is eight-coordinate that could prevent quenching of the luminescence. Furthermore, the energy transfer to the metal centre is achieved via both the DBM and phen ligands that effectively improves the injection and transport properties of the carriers and shields the 4f ion from quenching.367 A maximum current efficiency of 5.51 cd A−1, power efficiency of 4.94 lm W−1, EQE of 3.11% and a low turn-on voltage of 2.5 V, was achieved for the TADF exciplex host m-bis(N-carbazolyl)benzene PO-T2T (mCP:PO-T2T), doped with 10 wt% complex 338.367 Furthermore, the performance of these devices with dopant concentrations ranging from 4 to 20 wt% were recorded and are summarized in Table 9. Pure red emission with an EQE of 10.17%, was achieved for the device comprising of 4 wt% of the Cu(dppnc)-R emitter doped into a CBP host, which represents the highest efficiency reported for a red Cu-OLED to date.441–444 The first examples of TADF-OLEDs based on lanthanide polypyridyl complexes were prepared to overcome the difficulties associated with the development of red OLED.426 The low turn-on voltage of the device can be ascribed to the barrier-free carrier injection, but the high roll-off ratio (42%) is attributed to the lack of balance between the transport and recombination of the carriers. The maximum energy transfer efficiency between the exciplex host and the Eu-complex takes place for an optimal doping concentration of 10 wt%.445,446 This result highlights the potential of lanthanide complexes possessing near-IR emission to find applications as new advanced functional electroluminescence materials.445,446 The advantage of using metal-based complexes that undergo TADF over organic compounds is attributed to their improved thermal stabilities due to their heavier molecular weights, increasing the rates of intersystem crossing (KISC),447,448 as well as the significant reduction in ΔEST and increase in kRISC by changing the dihedral angles between the acceptor and the donor. In order to overcome the low thermal stability of the copper complex, Sakai et al. reported the first zinc complexes namely, bis[2-(benzo[d]oxazol-2-yl)-5-(10H-phenoxazin-10-yl)phenolato]zinc(II) and bis[2-(benzo[d]oxazol-2-yl)-4-(10H phenoxazin-10-yl)phenol]zinc(II), 359 and 360, in which thermally activated delayed fluorescence arises from intra-ligand charge transfer.427 The thermal stability is the key feature of these zinc complexes, making them suitable for fabrication into OLEDs by vacuum deposition methods.427 The large kRISC and small ΔEST in complex 359 improves the efficiency of up conversion and relaxing exciton annihilation.427 Replacing Zn with Li (361) or Mg (362) affords devices displaying reasonable parameters that are summarized in Table 9. The PL decay lifetimes of these complexes follow the trend 361 > 362 > 359 and analyzing the kinetic rates, a systematic atomic-number effect was identified.427 To summarize, in typical metal complexes comprising of conventional fluorescent materials, spin orbit coupling promotes KISC with increasing atomic number that eventually leads to a decrease in the PLQY. However, in the aforementioned TADF complexes, the kRISC values were enhanced, while the ΦPL remains constant.427 Comparing the efficiencies of the four devices it is apparent that complex 359 has the largest ηext which is close to 20%.
4.2 Promising Cu(I) and Ag(I) complexes as TADF emitters
Although there are many reports concerning new efficient complexes for potential applications as TADF emitters, only a few examples have actually been fabricated into OLED or LECs devices. Therefore, in this final section the focus is on TADF Cu(I) complexes with emissive properties that are particularly attractive for lighting applications. The first of these complexes is the highly luminescent Cu(I), [Cu(dmp)(phanephos)]+ (363), with two chelating, dmp = 2,9-dimethyl-1,10-phenanthroline and phanephos = 4,12-bis(diphenylphosphino)-[2.2]paracyclophane ligands.449 For this complex at T < 120 K, a long-lived phosphorescence of 240 μs was observed as shown in Fig. 55. In contrast, at ambient-temperature, TADF emission is observed and the decay time becomes shorter, dropping to 14 μs. Moreover, as the temperature increases, kr increases by a factor of twenty i.e. from kr = 3 × 103 s−1, to kr (DF) = 6 × 104 s−1. It is noteworthy that the phanephos and dmp ligands confer a rigid structural topology of the Cu(I) complex and, as a result, non-radiative relaxation processes to the ground state are likely suppressed, so an intense green-yellow luminescence is observed even in solution. The authors highlight the potential of this rigid Cu(I) complex for used in efficient OLEDs due to its small ΔE(S1–T1) energy separation as a result of TADF. The same researchers, also published studies on the very intense green-yellow luminescent mononuclear Cu(I) complex Cu(dppb)-(pz2Bph2) (364), together with two other compounds Cu(pop)(pz2Bph2) (365), and [Cu(dmp)(phanephos)]+ (363) where dppb = 1,2-bis-(diphenylphosphino)benzene and pz2Bph2 = diphenylbis-(pyrazol-1-yl)borate, which exhibit TADF at ambient temperatures.450
 Fig. 55  Emission decay time vs. temperature for microcrystalline [Cu(dmp)(phanephos)](PF6), 363, excited at λexc = 355 nm (pulse width 7 ns). The emission was detected at λdet = 550 nm. The solid line represents a fit of bi-exponential decay model to the experimental data with a phosphorescence decay time τ(T1) = 240 μs, at 77 K. The resulting fit parameters are ΔE(S1–T1) = 1000 cm−1 and τ(S1) = 40 ns, representing the magnitude of the singlet–triplet splitting and the decay time of the spontaneous S1 → S0 fluorescence, respectively. The spontaneous fluorescence is not observed directly due to much faster intersystem crossing. τ(DF) = 14 μs which is the decay time of the delayed fluorescence at ambient temperature.

For all the three Cu(I) complexes, the energy separation ΔE(S1–T1) lies within the range 370–1000 cm−1, affording very different emission colors. The luminescence properties of these compounds between 1.5 and 300 K are presented in Fig. 56. The three compounds exhibit emission quantum yields higher than 70%, hence it is very likely that these materials could be exploited for the fabrication of highly efficient OLEDs. Interestingly, the smallest energy separation ΔE(S1–T1) = 370 cm−1 (46 eV), between the first excited singlet and triplet states was found for complex 364 that also has the shortest TADF decay time of any Cu(I) complex reported to-date, i.e. τ (TADF, 300 K) = 3.3 μs. The small energy separation ΔE(S1–T1) in these complexes is attributed to the distinct CT character of the emissive states due to the small quantum-mechanical exchange interaction.

In a notable effort to explore the relationship between the position and the type of functional substituents on the organic ligands vs. the optical performances of the resulting complexes, a new series of cuprous complexes, 366–370, were prepared with POP (bis[2-(dipenylphosphino)-phenyl]ether) and 6-methyl-2-(1-(R-phenyl)-1H-pyrazol-3-yl)pyridine ligands in which the substituent R = H for complex 366, 2-CH3 for complex 367, 4-CH3 for complex 368, 2-CF3 for complex 369 and 4-CF3 for complex 370.451 These complexes show prominent blue to blue-green TADF with quantum yields close to 100% in the solid state and are air stabile with no visible decomposition up to 300 °C under nitrogen.451 As expected, the results of this study indicate that charge, steric hindrance and the electron withdrawing/accepting nature of the substituents on the organic ligands significantly affect the optical properties complexes.451 It should also be noted that only small variations (∼16 nm) in the emission spectra were recorded for single crystals vs. thin films and that these complexes are significantly stable compared to processing, as shown in Fig. 57. Bearing these factors in mind, we therefore conclude that this family of Cu(I) complexes are also very promising emissive materials for the fabrication of stable, blue OLEDs.

In two important studies published in 2017,452,453 a team of researchers led by Shafikov and Yersin studied the effects of substituents452 on the photophysical properties as well as improving the TADF efficiency of a series of new Ag(I) complexes containing a phenanthroline core and negatively charged electron donor (P2-nCB) ligands namely, Ag(phen)(P2-nCB) (371), Ag(idmp)(P2-nCB) (372), Ag(dmp)(P2-nCB) (373) and Ag(dbp)(P2-nCB) (374), in which P2-nCB = bis(diphenylphosphine)-nido-carborane, phen = 1,10-phenanthroline, idmp = 4,7-dimethyl-1,10-phenanthroline, dmp = 2,9-dimethyl-1,10-phenanthroline, and dbp = 2,9-di-n-butyl-1,10-phenanthroline (Fig. 58). Ag(I) complexes generally exhibit long lived phosphorescence from ligand-centered (LC) excited states of 3π–π* character.454–458

For TADF, the d orbitals of these complexes need to be destabilized in order to have significant contributions from their HOMO, HOMO−1, and HOMO−2 frontier orbitals.
In this respect, the use of a strongly electron donating ligand can address this challenge, especially if the ligand is negatively charged. In this study, 1,10-phenanthroline was coupled with a phosphine ligand to stabilize the orbitals (LUMO, LUMO+1) of the complexes whose ΦPL values follow the order Ag(phen)(P2-nCB) (371) < Ag(idmp)(P2-nCB) (372) < Ag(dmp)(P2-nCB) (373) < Ag(dbp)-(P2-nCB) (374). This trend reflects the increasing rigidity of the complexes that in turn increases the radiative decay and decreases the non-radiative decay rates.
One of the important parameters for TADF efficiency that is proportional to the radiative rate is the oscillator strength of the S1 ↔ S0 transition f (S1 ↔ S0), which also follows the above trend due to its dependence on the coordination geometry of the complex in the emitting state. Furthermore, the oscillator strength for the S0 → S1 transition in these complexes is an order of magnitude higher when compared to other organo-metallic TADF materials with similar ΔE(S1–T1) splitting, In fact, the large, allowed S0 ↔ S1 transition for Ag(dbp)(P2-nCB) (374), results in extraordinary emission properties due to the fact that it exhibits ground breaking TADF efficiency, including a high TADF rate with a significantly short radiative TADF decay time of only τr = 1.4 μs. The ΦPL reported for a powder sample of complex 374 at ambient temperature reached to 100% (Fig. 59 and 60).452,453 As a result, these compounds are very exciting for applications in lighting technology. In fact, Ag(dbp)(P2-nCB) (374) is the first compound ever reported with a TADF decay time that is shorter than the phosphorescence decay time τr of 1.5 μs reported for the benchmark Ir(ppy)3.458

Finally, this study would not be complete without highlighting the versatility of tetrazole as an ancillary ligand. In this respect, tetrazole is well known to chemists since it has been previously used for the preparation of a broad range materials that include biological compounds,459,460 as well as in the photovoltaics461 and optoelectronics,462 including OLEDs, applications.297
However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no reports concerning the use of this ligand for the discovery of TADF complexes. One of the most important goals in developing new TADF emitters, is to determine the rate at which singlet states of the compounds convert to triplets. In 2016 Bergmann et al., reported the first calculation of the rate of intersystem crossing for a of Cu(I) tetrazolate complex. Later, picosecond time-resolved solid state photoluminescence was reported for the highly emissive mononuclear TADF Cu(I) emitter, [(bis(2(diphenylphosphino)phenyl)ether)Cu(5-(2-pyridyl)tetrazolate)] (375).175 An ISC rate constant of 3.7 × 1010 s−1 with an ISC time constant of 27 ps, together with slow reverse intersystem crossing and a TADF average lifetime of 11.5 ms was also reported for this complex. Information concerning intersystem crossing has shed important light on excited-state mechanisms in Cu(I) TADFs containing tetrazole ligands, whose emissive properties are very promising for OLED applications.
Although, the concept of TADF based OLEDs is a relatively new phenomenon, the first families of these compounds look very promising and reflect the outstanding achievements accomplished in this field to-date. By harvesting both singlet and triplet excitons for light emission, OLEDs with performances that exceed their phosphorescence-based counterparts can now be fabricated. To summarize, TADF emitters have the high efficiencies associated with second generation (triplet) emitters and high stabilities that are comparable with first generation of materials, while overcoming triplet–triplet annihilation and the low device stabilities commonly encountered in phosphorescent OLEDs. There is no doubt that new discoveries will continue to inspire future generations of scientists and provide a solid foundation for the development of diverse families of efficient TADF emitters in the coming years.
5 Conclusions
The main objective of this review has been to provide a comprehensive, authoritative and critical reference for scholars working in the interdisciplinary field of light-to-energy conversion. Research progress over the past two decades concerning the development of metal complexes containing polypyridyl ligands is highlighted. Given the growing demand for new materials with enhanced quantum yields and high luminescence efficiencies, attention was focused on the highly efficient, emissive complexes whose ancillary ligands have been chemically tuned to encompass the entire visible region. The versatility of these compounds to provide light-emission management solutions for multi-color displays, as well as advanced lighting applications are also highlighted. Current challenges in the field of molecular electronics are presented together with strategies to overcome these obstacles, so that the true commercial promise of these compounds can be realized. Significant progress towards the development of second and third generation TADF-OLEDs based on organometallic and metal–organic complexes whose ancillary ligands can be systematically tuned has been discussed. Another objective of this work was the analysis of the state of the art and how to bridge the gap between molecular design and commercialization, which is currently one of the “hottest” challenges in this field of science to date. In this view, by carefully reviewing all the families of polypyridyl complexes reported to-date we conclude that for the development of efficient Ir(III) based OLEDs, the most promising complex is 172, which comprises two ppy ligands with fluorine substituents on the 3,4,6 positions of the phenyl rings, together with a bidentate polypyridyl ligand containing a tetraphenylimidodiphosphinate (tpip) moiety. In contrast for LECs, compound 120 containing a bpy ancillary ligand is one of the most outstanding Ir cyclometalated complexes reported to-date with an EQE of 14.9% and near-quantitative internal quantum efficiency. However, more work is needed to increase the device stability, keeping this high device efficiency. As to date, LECs are still facing the challenge to meet high efficiencies, stabilities, and color control by the same type of emitter. Finally, one of the most efficient TADF inorganic complexes containing a polypyridyl ligand with an EQE of over 23% is NHetPHOS (349), comprising of a butterfly-shaped Cu2I2 unit coordinated by two ancillary phosphine ligands that are bridged by an N,P-ligand. This compound is particularly promising for future commercialization due to its high thermal stability attributed to the presence of the multi-bridged binuclear Cu(I) ion.
To conclude we believe that future studies on high-performance OLEDs will not only continue to advance their commercial applications but will also accelerate the discovery of new fundamental science. If chemists continue to successfully work alongside scientists from neighboring fields, many new, exciting advances in this field will be possible.
