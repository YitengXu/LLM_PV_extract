Understanding of stability and degradation is also of critical importance as these materials seek commercial applications. In this study, we investigate the evolution of perovskites formed from targeted precursor chemistries by correlating in situ temperature-dependent X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric analysis, and mass spectral analysis of the evolved species. This suite of analyses reveals important precursor composition-induced variations in the processes underpinning perovskite formation and degradation. The addition of Cl− leads to widely different precursor evolution and perovskite formation kinetics, and results in significant changes to the degradation mechanism, including suppression of crystalline PbI2 formation and modification of the thermal stability of the perovskite phase. This work highlights the role of perovskite precursor chemistry in both its formation and degradation.

Broader context
Metal halide perovskites have the potential to be transformative solution-processed semiconductors with a broad range of applications from sensing to lasing. Specifically, lead halide perovskites have already shown their worth in photovoltaics with certified power conversion efficiencies reaching 21%. Perovskites are processed from solution, which could dramatically reduce manufacturing complexity and cost; however, understanding how the crystallization and degradation of the material is influenced by the precursor solution composition is critical to achieving the high performance, reproducibility, and stability needed for them to succeed commercially. In this study we utilize a suite of in situ analysis techniques to monitor methylammonium lead iodide crystallization and degradation from precursor solutions with and without chloride. We correlate thermally-induced structural changes in the film with detailed analysis of component desorption to reveal the dramatic and subtle differences that chloride has on the kinetics and mechanism of perovskite crystallization and degradation.

Introduction
Photovoltaic (PV) devices based on halide perovskites, most notably methylammonium lead iodide, have experienced unprecedented rises in device efficiency leading to the current certified record of 22.1% (http://www.nrel.gov/ncpv/).1–3 Beyond efficient solar cells, another important success of the recent research on halide perovskite absorbers has been the development of low-temperature solution-processed semiconductor films with optoelectronic properties that, in some respects, compare favorably to high-performance semiconductors such as GaAs grown by molecular beam epitaxy.4–6 The combination of facile formation, wide tunability, and good optoelectronic properties has spawned an array of applications for halide perovskites beyond PV, including electrolytic water splitting,7,8 light emitting diodes,9 lasing,10,11 transistors,12 spintronics,13 and gas sensors.14 Understanding how to control the transformation from precursor ink into solid semiconductor is critical to producing high performance devices for all of these applications.15 For example, even in the relatively simple case of CH3NH3PbX3 thin films (X = I, Br, or Cl) cast from solution, variations in the solvent,16–19 stoichiometry,20,21 atmosphere,22,23 annealing,24–26 and halide1,27–30 can change the morphology and optoelectronic properties of the resulting film.
Of the synthetic techniques developed for preparing halide perovskite films, mixed halide films cast from precursor containing both iodide and chloride, originally introduced by Snaith and coworkers,1 are of particular interest. The nomenclature of CH3NH3PbI3−xClx is used for these chloride-derived films with the caveat that the miscibility of the iodide and chloride perovskites is low (on the order of <5% Cl−),31–33 and Cl content is even lower in fully annealed devices.34,35 In addition to photovoltaic efficiency in excess of 18% achieved by multiple groups with this system,36–39 Cl− content may correlate with increased photoluminescence lifetime compared to pure CH3NH3PbI3.29,40–42 Chloride ions, and the excess CH3NH3+ which accompanies them, also alter solution phase equilibria and perovskite film growth mechanisms.20,28,43–45 While high-efficiency perovskite solar cells have also been demonstrated using sophisticated deposition techniques which do not utilize chloride-containing solutions,19,46 chloride-containing precursors serve as an instructive model system to reveal how precursor chemistry influences the structural and thermodynamic aspects of perovskite crystallization and degradation.
In this report, structural phase transitions that occur during annealing are probed using temperature-dependent X-ray diffraction (T-XRD) in concert with thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) and temperature-programmed desorption mass spectrometry (TPD-MS). When combined, these techniques allow for the correlation, across solution chemistries, of in situ measurements of thermally-induced structural changes and component desorption. This provides a comprehensive picture of how precursor composition modulates the kinetics and mechanisms of perovskite crystallization and degradation, critical information for improving the crystallinity and stability of solution-processed materials.
Results and discussion
Annealing-induced structural changes
A variety of precursor compositions were explored to observe the role of precursor chemistry in the crystallization, stability, and degradation of CH3NH3PbI3 and CH3NH3PbI3−xClx. Detailed analysis was undertaken using precursor solutions with varying ratios of methylammonium iodide (MAI), methylammonium chloride (MACl), lead iodide (PbI2) and lead chloride (PbCl2) in DMF: 1:1 mole ratio MAI:PbI2, 1:1:1 MAI:MACl:PbI2, and 3:1 MAI:PbCl2. This range of initial precursor stoichiometries was designed to contrast pure triiodide and iodide-chloride derived films while elucidating the role Cl− plays when added as either PbCl2 or MACl.28,44 Films were drop-cast from these precursor solutions in a N2 glovebox and removed to atmospheric air where XRD patterns were taken during a 2 °C min−1 ramp from room temperature to 400 °C (Fig. 1). Different phase regimes for each sample were characterized as the temperature increased. The structural nature of these phases can be categorized as a low temperature precursor phase, an intermediate phase only existing in chloride-containing films, a perovskite phase, and a high temperature phase which is the result of CH3NH3PbI3 thermal degradation. Details of these phases and their transitions will be covered in the ensuing discussion. This nomenclature and the approximate temperature range these phases appear are notated on the XRD patterns in Fig. 1.

Horizontal line cuts were taken in each structurally distinct region in Fig. 1 and compiled in Fig. 2A to compare each phase from each precursor directly. In all cases studied, there is a crystalline precursor phase at room temperature (Fig. 2B). Crystalline phases incorporating the precursors were first observed by Tan et al. using a 3:1 MAI:PbCl2 solution47 and have since been observed to form from numerous other solution compositions.20,37,48–51 The precursor phases formed from the two chloride-containing solutions in this study exhibit the same crystal structure, whereas the pure triiodide precursor is distinct. This confirms that the precursor phase is dependent on the anion, as shown previously by Moore et al.51 Previous investigation of spin-coated films from 3:1 MAI:PbCl2 in DMF has uncovered at least two unique precursor phases. DMF·PbI2 was first reported to form from this solution;37,50 however, a second unidentified precursor phase which does not incorporate solvent has also been characterized, supported by near identical XRD patterns obtained for 3:1 MAI:PbCl2 films cast from either DMF or DMSO.51

In contrast to these previous reports, for the experimental conditions used herein (viz., drying a drop-cast solution at room temperature in an N2 atmosphere), the XRD patterns of the crystalline precursor for both 1:1:1 MAI:MACl:PbI2 and 3:1 MAI:PbCl2 match the simulated XRD pattern of DMF·CH3NH3PbI3 (Fig. 2B).49 Deviation from the expected peak intensities of a randomly oriented crystal indicates the DMF·CH3NH3PbI3 precursor phase is textured (having a non-random distribution of crystallographic orientations). That Cl− is not incorporated into the crystalline portion of the precursor suggests it exists in a separate amorphous phase. In addition, the wide variability of crystalline precursors observed in the literature, which form from purportedly identical solutions further reveals how the precise details of film formation and crystallization influence the nature of the precursor phases.
In the case of 1:1 MAI:PbI2, previous studies have reported no crystalline precursor phase in films cast by spin-coating,20 although one is formed when excess MAI is present.20,51 Those results contrast with our findings here; a crystalline precursor is present, which appears to be composed of at least two distinct phases: one phase is CH3NH3PbI3, and the other phase is unidentified but does not correspond to the reported crystal structures of MAI, PbI2, DMF·CH3NH3PbI3, or DMF·PbI2, as shown in the Fig. S1 in the ESI.† In brief, when Cl− is present from either MACl or PbCl2 the structure calculated for a “chloride-free”-DMF·CH3NH3PbI3 complex is observed, but a distinct precursor is formed when Cl− is absent (Fig. 2B).
In chloride-containing samples, a sharp transition from precursor to intermediate phase is observed at approximately 50 °C. This intermediate has previously been assigned to a chloride-rich phase of CH3NH3PbI3−xClx in the literature.32,33,37,52 The peak in the intermediate phase at 15.6° corresponds with the (100) peak of CH3NH3PbCl3; however, the absence of other CH3NH3PbCl3 reflections, particularly those reflections expected to appear at 22.3, 35.5, and 39° (Fig. S2, ESI†) makes conclusive assignment to a chloride-rich CH3NH3PbI3−xClx difficult in the present case. The 15.6° reflection is thus assigned to either a highly textured chloride-rich CH3NH3PbI3−xClx phase or another distinct and as yet unidentified phase.
Temperature-dependent X-ray diffraction (T-XRD) enables unique visualization of the perovskite crystallization and degradation. Vertical line cuts of the 2-dimensional T-XRD data (Fig. 1) through the dominant reflections of each of the phases of interest are shown in Fig. 2C–E. In the simplest case of stoichiometric MAI:PbI2 (Fig. 2C), the films initially contain both precursor and CH3NH3PbI3 with a slow growth in perovskite peak intensity until, at 80 °C, there is an abrupt decrease in precursor peak intensity and a concomitant rise in the intensity of the perovskite peaks. As the temperature is increased further at 2 °C min−1, the intensity of the perovskite peaks increases indicating the continued formation of crystalline perovskite. At approximately 215 °C this increase ceases and is followed by a rapid decrease in perovskite peak intensity until 250 °C, after which there is effectively no crystalline perovskite remaining. This decrease in perovskite intensity is mirrored by a rise in intensity of peaks attributed to PbI2, a degradation pathway that has been widely observed in earlier reports.53–55
Both the 1:1:1 MAI:MACl:PbI2 (Fig. 2D) and 3:1 MAI:PbCl2 (Fig. 2E) systems initially exist as crystalline DMF·CH3NH3PbI3 along with an amorphous chloride-containing phase. This precursor phase is the dominant phase until ∼50 °C when there is a rise in intensity for both the intermediate and perovskite phases. After a sharp initial rise, the perovskite peaks decrease in tandem with a further rise in the intermediate phase, implying that gentle heating shifts the phase equilibrium toward the intermediate. The trend reverses beginning at ∼100 °C; more perovskite is formed, while the intermediate phase is lost until it is largely gone by 150 °C. The complex equilibrium between perovskite and intermediate appears to be greatly influenced by the presence of the chloride-rich phase, but may be further complicated by interactions with atmospheric humidity.56
Degradation of films cast with the 1:1:1 MAI:MACl:PbI2 and 3:1 MAI:PbCl2 stoichiometries show distinct behavior relative to the 1:1 MAI:PbI2 sample. While the perovskite peaks in the 1:1 MAI:PbI2 sample increase in intensity up until ∼215 °C, the perovskite peaks in both of the chloride-containing samples begin to diminish at ∼180 °C. This is consistent with the behavior of thermally evaporated CH3NH3PbI3−xClx films.32 This reduction of perovskite peak intensity signals the beginning of degradation, but, unlike for 1:1 MAI:PbI2, is not accompanied by an associated rise in crystalline PbI2. In fact, while some crystalline PbI2 is formed, it is less dramatic when Cl− is present, and a much weaker PbI2 XRD signal is observed for the degraded phase of CH3NH3PbI3−xClx when compared to CH3NH3PbI3. Moreover, unlike the sharp CH3NH3PbI3 to PbI2 transition, CH3NH3PbI3−xClx degradation extends over a very wide temperature range with some perovskite persisting beyond 280 °C, indicating a substantially different degradation mechanism than chloride-free films.

Fig. 1 and 2 demonstrate that the addition of Cl− into the precursor also has dramatic effects on the temperature-dependent phase evolution of the resulting film. We further narrow our study to the role of Cl− on the composition of the perovskite phase during the temperature ramp. The lattice parameter of the perovskite films is tracked using the (200) peak at ∼28° to qualitatively monitor Cl− content (Fig. 3), as described by Vegard's Law.33 For the MAI:PbI2 sample, a gradual shift in the perovskite (200) peak is ascribed to thermal expansion of the lattice with a volumetric thermal expansion coefficient of αv = 9.9 × 10−5 K−1. On the other hand, the behavior of the (200) peak of the CH3NH3PbI3−xClx samples can be divided into two regimes: (i) at higher temperatures (>180 °C) the (200) peak shift tracks closely with the shift of CH3NH3PbI3, indicating that the peak shift in this regime is dominated by thermal expansion. (ii) Conversely, below 180 °C, the (200) peak of the CH3NH3PbI3−xClx samples shifts much more dramatically. This larger rate of volume expansion is ascribed to a continual decrease in the Cl− content of the CH3NH3PbI3−xClx lattice which slows dramatically above ∼180 °C, likely due to the very low Cl− concentration remaining in the perovskite lattice beyond this temperature. The differences in peak position between the three samples at these high temperatures can be adequately explained by the variability of the perovskite lattice parameters caused by variations in sample crystallinity and/or fabrication method.33

Correlating thermal, structural, and desorption analysis
The differences in the crystallization and degradation of CH3NH3PbI3 and CH3NH3PbI3−xClx films prompted further study into the component desorption which drives these processes. Measurements of Cl− content in CH3NH3PbI3−xClx films are typically very low.34,35,57 Thus, Cl− (and CH3NH3+) desorption is clearly an important aspect of CH3NH3PbI3−xClx film formation.33,43 To delve deeper into the process of MACl and MAI desorption, the mass spectrum of the evolving species during a 5 °C min−1 temperature ramp was monitored using TPD-MS.
An immediate difference between the CH3NH3PbI3 and CH3NH3PbI3−xClx films is apparent in the two-dimensional TPD-MS maps of the films, shown in Fig. 4. The spectra of the 1:1 MAI:PbI2-derived perovskite films show relatively few peaks following the initial loss of DMF while the spectra of the chloride-containing films is much more complicated. To aid in analysis of the TPD-MS spectra, control samples were taken of MACl, MAI, and PbI2 in DMF (Fig. S4, ESI†). This data, along with horizontal line cuts of the TPD-MS spectra shown in Fig. 4 at various temperatures (Fig. S5, ESI†), was used to characterize the observed fragmentation patterns.§Table 1 summarizes the key species observed in TPD-MS and their corresponding m/z ratios.

Vertical line cuts were taken at key m/z ratios of the TPD-MS data of Fig. 4 (Fig. 5A, ESI†) and correlated to TGA (Fig. 5B) to further probe the thermal stability and correlate phase changes observed in XRD to desorption events. Beginning with the stoichiometric 1:1 MAI:PbI2 sample (purple traces, Fig. 5), once DMF has evaporated, both TPD-MS and TGA show a broad region where very little material desorbs from the film associated with crystalline CH3NH3PbI3 detailed in Fig. 1 and 2. The shoulder at ∼100 °C in this peak in the first derivative of TGA (Fig. 5B) indicates that some of the DMF is complexed with the perovskite. Desorption of this complexed DMF correlates well with the formation of crystalline CH3NH3PbI3 by XRD. From the onset of the second peak in TGA the degradation temperature of the CH3NH3PbI3 is estimated to be 224 ± 3 °C. Around this same temperature, there is a rise of m/z = 31 along with a parallel rise in m/z = 15 and 17 (CH3+ and NH3+, respectively), which is assigned to the loss of CH3NH2+ and its degradation products. Likewise, this correlates with the temperature at which the perovskite XRD peak intensity begins to decrease. This parallels the sublimation of pure MAI,58 and the single peak in the first derivative of the TGA curve indicates a single-step mechanism. Taken together, while iodine is not directly observed in this sample (only CH3NH2+), MAI loss appears to occur in a single desorption step which begins to occur at 210–220 °C and this drives degradation to PbI2.

(B) The first derivative of the TGA heating curves for the three preparation methods. Lighter colors show the data multiplied by 10 with vertical dashed lines indicating the crystal phase regimes observed in Fig. 1 as a guide for the eye. 
The TPD-MS spectra and decomposition mechanism of the CH3NH3PbI3−xClx films are complicated by the addition of Cl− into the system. In the 1:1:1 MAI:MACl:PbI2 system (orange traces, Fig. 5), the TGA curves do not show the same stable perovskite region observed with 1:1 MAI:PbI2. Instead there is a continuous mass loss as the film is heated from 80 to 180 °C, which is consistent with the shift of the perovskite (200) peak in Fig. 3 and implies Cl− addition gives rise to new volatile species. The peak at m/z = 31 of the TPD-MS data, attributed to the loss of CH3NH2+, is visible throughout this temperature range and can account for the slow continual mass loss. While this mass loss is likely chiefly MACl due to the lower sublimation temperature of MACl compared to MAI (Tsub,MACl = 195 ± 9 °C, Tsub,MAI = 247 ± 26 °C),58 it appears at a significantly reduced temperature compared to the sublimation of either pure species. A similar effect has been seen previously by Zhao et al. where pure MACl and MABr sublime at significantly higher temperatures than when they are complexed with PbI2.59 The reduced sublimation temperature of MAX species in halide alloys may have significant negative implications for the stability of these alloys in general, although detailed operational stability studies are required to confirm this result in photovoltaics. There are also small peaks in this temperature range at m/z = 63 and 78 which are attributed to I2+ and CH4NI2+ from MAI (Fig. S4B, ESI†), indicating that Cl− promotes MAI loss. The absence of peaks at m/z = 67 and 69 suggests that, as previously reported,33,60 MACl is dissociated while leaving the sample at these temperatures, though this could also be due to fragmentation by the MS.
Similar to the pure iodide films, degradation of the 1:1:1 MAI:MACl:PbI2-derived CH3NH3PbI3−xClx, observed by XRD at 180–190 °C, coincides with a rise in CH3NH2+ in TPD-MS along with the concomitant rise of peaks at m/z = 15 and 17. At the same temperature, peaks arise at m/z = 50 and 52 which do not occur without Cl− and are attributed to CH335Cl+ and CH337Cl+. The absence of these peaks in the TPD-MS data of pure MACl (Fig. S4A, ESI†) implies that formation of these compounds is catalyzed by Pb. Rise in CH3Cl+ is followed at slightly higher temperature by a rise in the peak at m/z = 78 (attributed to CH4NI2+). These peaks all show an increase in intensity that mirrors the decrease in the perovskite peaks seen with T-XRD (Fig. 2D). Furthermore, both m/z = 50 and 78 contain a single high temperature peak while m/z ratios with contributions from both MACl and MAI (viz., m/z = 15, 17, 31) have multiple peaks. Likewise, the large peak in the first derivative of the TGA attributed to perovskite degradation has its onset at 181 ± 3 °C, and also contains two distinct peaks. So, while a portion of the MACl and MAI desorb at significantly reduced temperatures, the majority leaves at temperatures consistent with the sublimation of the pure components.
From these complementary techniques, we concluded that a gradual loss of MACl and MAI (in the chloride-containing perovskites) begins at ∼100 °C and is then accelerated by ∼180 °C, the temperature at which CH3NH3PbI3−xClx begins to degrade by XRD (approximately 40 °C lower than pure CH3NH3PbI3). Despite the lower initial temperature for perovskite degradation, a crystalline perovskite phase persists to higher temperature in the chloride-derived films than CH3NH3PbI3 (approximately 280 °C vs. 250 °C, respectively). Degradation occurs over a ∼100 °C temperature window with Cl− and only a ∼35 °C window without Cl−. The broad degradation profile with Cl− can be explained by two degradation regimes: (i) during the initial stages of degradation MACl loss facilitates MAI loss and results in a lowered temperature for the beginning of perovskite degradation, while (ii) as the concentration of Cl− in the perovskite film becomes negligible, the resulting low chloride-content perovskite has a somewhat higher thermal stability than the pure I-derived material.
Broadly similar results are seen with 3:1 MAI:PbCl2 (green traces, Fig. 5) when compared to the 1:1:1 MAI:MACl:PbI2 case. There is a continual mass loss seen in the TGA of these films and the degradation peak is bimodal with an onset of 183 ± 3 °C corresponding with the onset of a decrease in perovskite XRD peak intensity. This parallels a rise in the peaks at m/z = 50, 31, 17, and 15 in the TPD-MS spectra. While iodine is not detected evolving from these films (or the 1:1 MAI:PbI2 films), a limitation of the mass spectrometer to m/z < 100 makes firm conclusions about iodine in this system difficult. A summary of the mechanisms of perovskite formation and degradation with and without Cl− is outlined in Fig. 6.

Temperature increases from left to right with colored bars indicating the presence of the different phases (precursor, intermediate, perovskite, and degraded). Color intensity approximates crystalline phase abundance with the structure of identified phases shown in the corresponding cartoons. 
While spin-cast films are ubiquitous in high efficiency photovoltaic devices because of good film morphology, using drop-cast films provided improved signal-to-noise which allowed us to gain detailed mechanistic insight into the thermal evolution of these perovskite materials. Complementary T-XRD and TPD-MS studies were performed on films spin-cast from a 1:1:1 MAI:MACl:PbI2 precursor solution to compare with the results from drop-cast films (Fig. S6 and S7, respectively, ESI†). Similar to the drop-cast films, T-XRD of spin-coated films (Fig. S6, ESI†) reveals crystallization of a perovskite phase occurring at approximately 50 °C. The perovskite peaks at 2θ angles of 14.4 and 28.8° then begin to decrease at ∼150 °C. The poor signal-to-noise of these measurements on the thin spin-cast films does not allow for the characterization of the precursor/intermediate phases which are clearly seen in the thicker drop-cast films, although a very weak peak at 32.4° is seen which may arise from the previously characterized intermediate phase. In TPD-MS, (Fig. S7, ESI†) both samples show peaks at the same m/z ratios; however, in the spin-cast films we are unable to detect significant signal at an m/z of 50, corresponding to CH335Cl+ (Fig. S7C, ESI†).
It is of note that there is a similar degradation onset temperature in TGA for all chloride-containing precursors, no matter the introduction method (MACl or PbCl2) or initial concentration of Cl− (Fig. S8, ESI†). To confirm that the present results were not an artifact of the continual temperature ramp, TGA curves with a continuous temperature ramp and a 90 min anneal at a constant temperature of 100 °C were compared (Fig. S9, ESI†). For 1:1 MAI:PbI2 samples, no qualitative difference exists between the TGA behavior of the annealed and unannealed samples beyond the small mass loss which occurs during annealing. This mass loss is attributed to loss of DMF and some MAI which can occur during extended annealing, even at these moderate temperatures.61 On the other hand, annealing for 90 min somewhat improved the thermal stability of the chloride-containing precursors, at least as seen by TGA, although thermal stability of the annealed iodide/chloride sample is still considerably less than the pure triiodide sample and retained the slow continual mass loss throughout the 100–200 °C region. This stability improvement is likely due to the very low concentration of Cl− in annealed CH3NH3PbI3−xClx,34 but it suggests that the lower thermal stability of CH3NH3PbI3−xClx films is not wholly remedied simply by conventional annealing. In addition to the effects of Cl−, the role of solvent was probed by TGA measurements of 1:1 MAI:PbI2 in DMF, DMSO, and GBL (Fig. S10, ESI†). While the thermal stability of the DMF and GBL films is very similar, a ∼50 °C decrease in the onset of perovskite degradation occurs with DMSO. These preliminary results implicate the solvent as also playing an important role in perovskite crystallization and degradation.
Conclusion
The in situ monitoring of crystal structure, chemical composition, and component desorption has enabled a more complete picture of the formation and degradation of solution-processed lead halide perovskites and the variation of these processes with solution chemistry. The addition of Cl− to the system through either MACl or PbCl2 modifies the crystallization pathway from precursor-perovskite to precursor-intermediate-perovskite and dramatically changes crystallization kinetics, an effect which has been successfully harnessed in the fabrication of high efficiency perovskite solar cells.27 Additionally, the difference between the observed crystalline precursors in the present work and those formed from ostensibly identical solutions by spin-coating suggests that modulation of the precursor phase can be achieved by exerting kinetic and/or thermodynamic control on precursor formation. The presence of Cl− in the perovskite also modifies the degradation mechanism by promoting MAI loss and initiating perovskite degradation at a reduced temperature. On the other hand, Cl− suppresses crystalline PbI2 formation as a degradation product and allows a portion the material to retain its perovskite structure to higher temperatures than pure triiodide CH3NH3PbI3.
The insights gained from the combination of temperature-dependent XRD and tracking of the desorbed species which drive perovskite formation and degradation are an important step toward developing a complete understanding of these processes and how they might be beneficially controlled. This work has broad implications for the many potential halide perovskite optoelectronic devices, especially perovskite solar cells. Beyond atmosphere, sealing, and device architecture, the method of perovskite formation itself is likely a critical component to achieving the long-term stability required for the utilization of this exciting new material.
Experimental methods
Materials
Chemical were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received. Methylammonium iodide (CH3NH3I, MAI) was synthesized by the dropwise addition of methylamine (aqueous, 40 wt%) to an excess of cold HI (stabilized, 57 wt%). This mixture was stirred in an ice/salt bath for 2 h after which the volume of water was reduced by rotary evaporation. MAI was precipitated from solution by the addition of diethyl ether, collected by vacuum filtration, dried at 50 °C, and purified by repeated recrystallization from ethanol. Methylammonium chloride (CH3NH3Cl, MACl) was synthesized using the same procedure with HCl in place of HI.
Perovskite synthesis
A summary of the composition of the solutions used for perovskite synthesis is found in Table S1 in the ESI.† The precursor solutions were prepared by dissolving PbX2 and MAX (X = I or Cl) at the specified molar ratio in dimethylformamide (or dimethylsulfoxide/gamma-butyrolactone) by stirring at 70 °C. Thick films were formed by drop-casting these precursor solutions in an N2 atmosphere to optimize signal for the desired measurement technique.
Characterization
Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed using a TA Instruments SDT Q600 Simultaneous TGA/DSC system. 15–25 mg of the solution of interest was placed in an alumina crucible and then into the TGA/DSC for analysis. For temperature-dependent X-ray diffraction (T-XRD) and temperature-programmed desorption mass spectrometry (TPD-MS) precursor solutions were drop-cast onto a glass slide and allowed to dry for several hours in a N2 glovebox before being mounted onto the XRD stage or scraped into a quartz tube for TPD-MS. T-XRD and TPD-MS experiments were also carried out using spin-cast films of 1:1:1 MAI:MACl:PbI2. T-XRD was carried out using a Bruker D8 Discover with an area detector and temperature controlled stage with a constant ramp of 2 °C min−1. TPD measurements were taken using an in-house constructed TPD instrument. 10–30 mg was placed in a quartz sample tube in a nitrogen glove box, which was affixed to an isolation valve that allows for air-free transfer to the TPD instrument. After placing on the TPD instrument, samples were first evacuated to a base pressure of <1 × 10−7 Torr. The sample was then heated at a ramp rate of 5 °C min−1 from room temperature to 405 °C with a ceramic tube furnace placed around the quartz sample tube. The temperature was monitored with a thermocouple inside of the ceramic furnace located near the surface of the quartz sample tube, and approximately at the position of the sample. During the heating ramp, evolved species were monitored with a mass spectrometer (Stanford Research Systems Residual Gas Analyzer 100).

For example, desorption of DMF occurs at low temperature across the m/z ratios selected, clearly visible by the initial correlation between all m/z peaks and m/z = 73, the base peak for DMF. Nevertheless, at higher temperatures (>100 °C) the peaks no longer arise from DMF and instead are due to degradation of MAI and/or MACl. This is clearly seen in the m/z peaks at 50 and 52; at low temperatures the intensity ratio of m/z 50:52 is 0.3:1 for 1:1:1 MAI:MACl:PbI2 and 17:1 for 3:1 MAI:PbCl2, yet this ratio changes to 3.04:1 and 3.09:1, respectively, in the higher temperature peak at 200–300 °C. Thus, the peaks at 50 and 52 are attributed to CH335Cl+ and CH337Cl+, respectively, at high temperature, but do not (at least not entirely) arise from CH3Cl+ isotopes at low temperature.This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2016

Broader context
Metal halide perovskites have the potential to be transformative solution-processed semiconductors with a broad range of applications from sensing to lasing. Specifically, lead halide perovskites have already shown their worth in photovoltaics with certified power conversion efficiencies reaching 21%. Perovskites are processed from solution, which could dramatically reduce manufacturing complexity and cost; however, understanding how the crystallization and degradation of the material is influenced by the precursor solution composition is critical to achieving the high performance, reproducibility, and stability needed for them to succeed commercially. In this study we utilize a suite of in situ analysis techniques to monitor methylammonium lead iodide crystallization and degradation from precursor solutions with and without chloride. We correlate thermally-induced structural changes in the film with detailed analysis of component desorption to reveal the dramatic and subtle differences that chloride has on the kinetics and mechanism of perovskite crystallization and degradation.


 	Fig. 1  Temperature dependent X-ray diffraction patterns (2 °C min−1 ramp) of the precursor solutions (A) 1:1 MAI:PbI2, (B) 1:1:1 MAI:MACl:PbI2, and (C) 3:1 MAI:PbCl2. Demarcation of the various phase regimes with white horizontal lines is intended solely to serve as a guide for the eye.	 

 	Fig. 2  (A) XRD line cuts taken at 28 (precursor), 100 (intermediate), 150 (perovskite), and 300 °C (degraded) for the three samples. Key reflections attributed to the intermediate (yellow circles), perovskite (blue diamonds), and degraded (green squares) phases are indicated. (B) Comparison of the precursor phases with the simulated XRD pattern of CH3NH3PbI3·DMF. Line cuts of the T-XRD patterns of (C) 1:1 MAI:PbI2, (D) 1:1:1 MAI:MACl:PbI2, and (E) 3:1 MAI:PbCl2 taken at the 2θ angles labeled in (A) and summarized in Table S2 (ESI†).	 

 	Fig. 3  The shift of the perovskite (200) peak with increasing temperature where dashed lines indicate the predicted shift due to thermal expansion with αv = 9.9 × 10−5 K−1. Peak position was determined by Gaussian fitting of the XRD peaks shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†).	 

 	Fig. 4  TPD-MS spectra of the precursor solutions (A) 1:1 MAI:PbI2, (B) 1:1:1 MAI:MACl:PbI2, and (C) 3:1 MAI:PbCl2. A constant temperature ramp of 5 °C min−1 was used in each case. The different crystal phase regimes observed in Fig. 1 are denoted using white horizontal lines as a guide for the eye.

(B) The first derivative of the TGA heating curves for the three preparation methods. Lighter colors show the data multiplied by 10 with vertical dashed lines indicating the crystal phase regimes observed in Fig. 1 as a guide for the eye.	 

 	Fig. 6  Schematic representation of the overall process of perovskite formation and degradation starting from (A) 1:1 MAI:PbI2, and (B) 1:1:1 MAI:MACl:PbI2 and 3:1 MAI:PbCl2 solutions. Temperature increases from left to right with colored bars indicating the presence of the different phases (precursor, intermediate, perovskite, and degraded). Color intensity approximates crystalline phase abundance with the structure of identified phases shown in the corresponding cartoons.

§ It should be noted that the fragment/parent compound associated with each m/z ratio can change with temperature as discussed in the text. For example, desorption of DMF occurs at low temperature across the m/z ratios selected, clearly visible by the initial correlation between all m/z peaks and m/z = 73, the base peak for DMF. Nevertheless, at higher temperatures (>100 °C) the peaks no longer arise from DMF and instead are due to degradation of MAI and/or MACl. This is clearly seen in the m/z peaks at 50 and 52; at low temperatures the intensity ratio of m/z 50:52 is 0.3:1 for 1:1:1 MAI:MACl:PbI2 and 17:1 for 3:1 MAI:PbCl2, yet this ratio changes to 3.04:1 and 3.09:1, respectively, in the higher temperature peak at 200–300 °C. Thus, the peaks at 50 and 52 are attributed to CH335Cl+ and CH337Cl+, respectively, at high temperature, but do not (at least not entirely) arise from CH3Cl+ isotopes at low temperature.
