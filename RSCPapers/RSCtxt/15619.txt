    , Accepted 18th May 2012First published on 18th May 2012AbstractA novel D–A-π-A type organic dye (YCD01) incorporating a diketopyrrolopyrrole unit with a branched alkyl chain was synthesized for dye-sensitized solar cells. YCD01 showed a high conversion efficiency of 7.43% (AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2) with a Jsc of 13.40 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.76 V, a FF of 0.73 and an excellent stability.
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) have attracted considerable attention since Grätzel and co-workers published their seminal report in 1991.1 Owing to the efforts of many researchers over the past twenty years, DSCs based on Ru(II)–polypyridyl complexes have yielded a power conversion efficiency above 11%.2 At the same time, metal-free organic dyes have also been desirable due to their high extinction coefficient, ease of structural modification and low cost.3 However, organic dyes are still limited from practical use owing to their relatively narrow absorption bands, unfavourable aggregation on semiconductors and weaker light stability compared to metal-based sensitizers. Recently, a D–A-π-A configuration for organic dyes was reported and received increasing attention with an additional acceptor chromophore incorporated into the common D-π-A structure.4,5 By inserting the subordinate acceptor, which acts as an electron trap to separate charge and facilitate electron migration to the final acceptor, the sensitizer exhibits broad responsive spectra and long term stability. A high efficiency of nearly 9% under AM 1.5 G irradiation has been achieved based on this type of sensitizer in DSCs.
Diketopyrrolopyrroles (DPPs) are a class of commercialized and easily synthesized dyes with exceptional photochemical, mechanical and thermal stability, which have aroused lots of interest in bulk heterojunction solar cells6 and have also been considered as a π-conjugated component for DSCs.7 The efficient intermolecular charge transfer of the DPP moiety allows for high absorbance and is beneficial for the sensitizer to absorb at infrared wavelength. In addition, the electron-withdrawing properties of DPP, which is suitable for constructing the D–A-π-A configuration, can assist the electron distribution and greatly stabilize the sensitizer. However, the large π-conjugated system of DPP demonstrates strong π-stacked aggregation on TiO2,7a which may lead to dissipative intermolecular charge transfer and aggravate charge recombination. Recently, some researchers reported that by connecting long alkyl chains to the donor part of sensitizers, charge recombination could be successfully suppressed. However, aggregation of these modified sensitizers still occurs to a certain degree.8 Therefore, we assumed that attaching a bulky substituent in the middle part of the sensitizer might be a more effective way to reduce π–π stacking of molecules on a TiO2 film. Specially, owing to their bulk, branched alkyl chains effectively decrease aggregation of conjugated molecules and increase polymer solubility. With this in mind, we introduced a branched 2-ethyl-hexyl alkyl chain to the DPP moiety for the first time to further prohibit the dye aggregation. In addition, the steric hindrance of the branched chain may also block the I3− ion from approaching the TiO2 surface, thus reducing the charge recombination rate.
In this work, we developed a new D–A-π-A organic sensitizer, YCD01, bearing a 2-ethyl-hexyl alkyl chain in the DPP moiety, furan as the linker, cyanoacrylic acid as the acceptor moiety and the indoline unit9 was introduced as the donor for its powerful donor ability to further broaden the absorption spectrum and improve the efficiency. The corresponding dye TD01 was also synthesized as a comparison (Fig. 1). Syntheses of dyes YCD01 and TD01 in detail are described in the ESI (Scheme 1 and 2, ESI†).

The UV-Vis absorption spectra of the two dyes are shown in Fig. 2. Both dyes showed broad absorption spectra covering a wide range of the visible region. The maximum absorption of YCD01 was exhibited at 526 nm with a molar extinction coefficient (ε) of 4.6 × 104 M−1 cm−1, and for TD01 was exhibited at 514 nm with a ε of 4.1 × 104 M−1 cm−1 (Table S1, ESI†). The red-shift of the absorption band of YCD01 in comparison to TD01 was due to the stronger donor ability of the indoline moiety than triphenylamine. When absorbed on a transparent thin TiO2 film, TD01 showed broader absorption bands and a ∼32 nm red-shift in absorption compared to that measured in solution (Fig. 2, inset). The fine absorption bands ascribed to a π–π* transition and intermolecular charge transfer were vaguely visible in the spectrum. These phenomena indicate that there was a certain degree of π–π aggregation of TD01 on the TiO2 film. In contrast, in the spectrum of YCD01, fine absorption peaks were readily shown, and there was no distinct shift or extension of the absorption bands, which suggests that π–π aggregation was significantly reduced. This reduced aggregation was probably due to the presence of the branched alkyl chain, which appeared to have successfully prohibited the interaction of DPP molecules.

The energy levels of TD01 and YCD01 were determined by cyclic voltammetry (Table S1†). The ground state oxidation potentials, S+/0, of TD01 and YCD01 were 1.03 and 0.78 V, respectively, which were sufficiently low compared to the redox potential of the iodide/triiodide couple used as an electrolyte. The S+/0 energy level of YCD01 was negatively shifted 0.25 V compared to that of TD01 due to the introduction of the indoline moiety. The estimated excited-state oxidate potentials, S+/*, for TD01 and YCD01, calculated from S+/0 − E0-0, were −0.91 V and −1.10 V. The S+/* potentials of both of the two dyes were more negative than the conduction-band edge of TiO2 (−0.5 V vs. NHE), ensuring an efficient electron injection process from the excited state into the conduction band of TiO2.
To obtain an insight into the electron distribution of TD01 and YCD01, we calculated the optimized molecular structures and frontier orbitals of the two dyes by using the density functional theory computational method.10 At the ground state (HOMO) of these dyes, electrons are distributed on the D–A system and the excited state (LUMO) is delocalized across the entire A-π-A system (Fig. S2, ESI†), which suggests an inductive or electron-withdrawing tendency from the donor unit to the cyanoacetic acid unit.
DSCs were fabricated according to the literature procedure.11 The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the DSCs based on TD01 and YCD01 are shown in Fig. 3. YCD01 showed an excellent solar light response from 350 to 625 nm with a maximum value of 80% in the plateau region. Taking into account the reflection and absorption losses by the conducting glass, the IPCE in this range exceeded 90%. The photovoltaic performance was measured under AM 1.5 G simulated solar light at a light intensity of 100 mW cm−2 with a metal mask of 0.25 cm2. Under optimized conditions, with the addition of 0.5 M tert-butylpyridine (TBP) in the electrolyte, the YCD01-sensitized solar cell achieved a prominent overall conversion efficiency of 7.43%, with a short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) of 13.40 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.76 V and a fill factor (FF) of 0.73. Under the same conditions, TD01 showed 5.18% efficiency (Jsc = 11.05 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.69 V, FF = 0.68) (Fig. 3, Table S2, ESI†). YCD01 showed a higher Jsc than TD01, which is because the introduction of the indoline donor favors light harvesting in DSCs with better absorption spectra. In addition, the weak π–π aggregation of YCD01 on the TiO2 film also improved the electron injection efficiency of the cells.

The Voc value of YCD01 was 70 mV higher than that of TD01, which could be attributed to the introduction of a branched 2-ethyl-hexyl chain to the DPP core. The generation of Voc is related to the energy level of the TiO2 conduction band (ECB) and the charge recombination rate in DSCs. To clarify the effect of the branched alkyl chain on Voc, we first measured ECB with the charge extraction method (CEM)12 (Fig. S3, ESI†) and found that the ECB was almost unaffected for these two cases. Therefore, the improvement of Voc from TD01 to YCD01 based DSCs should be attributed to the suppression of charge recombination, which is related to electron lifetime (τ). We derived τ as a function of electron density by means of intensity-modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS) (Fig. 4).13 The electron lifetime decreased with increasing electron density in a manner consistent with a power law relationship. At a fixed electron density, the electron lifetime for the DSCs based on YCD01 was larger than that of TD01, which suggests that the branched 2-ethyl-hexyl chain was more effective than the single butyl chain for blocking I3− ions approaching the TiO2 surface for charge recombination, and thus showed an improvement in Voc.

Finally, in order to test the stability of YCD01, we made cells using 3-methoxy-propylnitrile (MPN) as an electrolyte solvent. The YCD01-sensitized solar cell showed an initial overall conversion efficiency of 5.19% with a Jsc of 11.04 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.72 V and FF of 0.65. The performance of the cell improved during the first 100 h and retained almost the same performance after 1000 h of accelerated tests under full sunlight soaking at 60 °C (Fig. 5). This demonstrates that the amount of dye on the TiO2 surface remained intact after a long soaking time.

In conclusion, we designed and synthesized a new D–A-π-A sensitizer, YCD01, with indoline as the electron donor, diketopyrrolopyrrole as the additional acceptor, furan as the linker and cyanoacrylic acid as the acceptor moiety. Attaching the 2-ethyl-hexyl chain in the middle of the DPP unit proved to be an effective means for reducing the π–π aggregation of the dyes on TiO2. Moreover, the steric hindrance of the branched chain successfully suppressed charge recombination and improved the open-circuit voltage. As a result, YCD01-sensitized DSCs achieved a high overall conversion efficiency of 7.43% with a broad IPCE response, high Voc and long-term stability. A systematic study of the effects of bulky alkyl groups attached to the DPP unit on the device performance and the further broadening of the absorption spectra to the infrared region is under process.
