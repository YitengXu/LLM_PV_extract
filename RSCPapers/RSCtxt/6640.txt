    , Accepted 30th May 2014First published on 2nd July 2014AbstractNew n-type conjugated polymer semiconductors bearing an electron-deficient naphthobisthiazole diimide (NBTDI) moiety have been synthesized and their electronic energy levels, solid-state morphology, field-effect charge transport and photovoltaic properties were investigated. Stille coupling polymerization of the new monomer 5,11-bis(4-bromophenyl)-2,8-bis(2-decyltetradecyl)-benzothiazolo[4,5,6,7-lmn]thiazolo[5,4-f][3,8]phenanthroline-1,3,7,9(2H, 8H)-tetrone with distannyl derivatives of the arylene moiety (1,4-phenylene/2,5-thienylene/vinylene) yielded poly(naphthobisthiazole diimide)s (PNBTDIs) with number-average molecular weights of 73–89 kDa and polydispersity indexes of 2.46–3.08. Thin films of the PNBTDIs have strong absorption bands in the visible region, resulting in an absorption edge optical band gap of 1.73–2.02 eV. X-ray diffraction analysis of neat films of PNBTDIs revealed lamellar crystalline materials with a rather short intermolecular π–π stacking distance of 0.34–0.35 nm. In thin film transistors, the PNBTDIs showed unipolar n-channel transport with electron mobility as high as 1.5 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1. All-polymer solar cells incorporating the PNBTDIs as an electron acceptor and thiazolothiazole copolymer (PSEHTT) as a donor had power conversion efficiencies of 1.1–1.5%. The results demonstrate that poly(naphthobisthiazole diimide)s are promising n-type materials for field-effect transistors and all-polymer solar cells.
1. Introduction
π-Conjugated polymer semiconductors are of growing interest for the diverse applications in electronics and optoelectronics, including organic field-effect transistors (OFETs)1 and organic photovoltaics (OPVs).2 In the past decade, the majority of synthetic efforts and structure–property studies in the field have been devoted to hole-conducting (p-type) polymer semiconductors, which have enabled major advances in device performance and the understanding of charge transport.2–4 In contrast, electron-conducting (n-type) polymer semiconductors remain relatively scarce and only limited structure–property studies have been reported.5–9 Hence, there remains a need to develop new n-type polymer semiconductors to enable studies of fundamental structure–property relationships and to facilitate advances in n-channel OFETs1,7 and all-polymer solar cells.10,12
Currently, the majority of the n-type conjugated polymers are typically made up of electron-deficient aromatic diimides.7–12 Among the aromatic diimides investigated as the building block in n-type conjugated polymers for n-channel OFETs and all-polymer solar cells, naphthalene diimide (NDI)9,10 and perylene diimide (PDI)11,12 are the most common. NDI-based conjugated polymers in particular are attractive because of their facile synthesis, good solution processability, and high crystallinity, which have enabled improved charge transport and device performance relative to PDI-based conjugated polymers.11 NDI–arylene copolymers are known to exhibit high electron mobilities in n-channel OFETs9 and more recently they have shown good electron transport properties in highly efficient all-polymer solar cells.10 On the other hand, electron-deficient benzobisthiazole (BZT, Chart 1) copolymers are well studied in organic electronics13a,e in the past decade and are known to exhibit a high degree of molecular order with robust thermal and oxidative stability as well as excellent mechanical properties.13b,c Although BZT copolymers have been successfully used as electron transport materials in organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs),13c,f their typical electron affinity (∼3.0 to 3.3 eV) and electron mobilities are too low for either high performance n-channel OFET or OPV applications. Recently, our group14 and others15 have explored naphthobisthiazole diimide (NBTDI), a hexacyclic ring in which NDI is laterally extended by thiazole moieties, as a new building block (Chart 1) for air-stable, solution-processable high performance n-type organic semiconductors. As expected, the electron affinity (≥4 eV) and ionization potential (∼6 eV) of NBTDI-containing molecules are significantly enhanced compared to BZT-bearing materials; furthermore, the increased polycyclic ring size and more symmetric connection to adjacent moieties compared to NDI suggest that NBTDI has potential for developing n-type small molecules and polymer-based organic semiconductors for n-channel OFETs and OPV devices.

In this paper, we report the synthesis, field-effect charge transport and photovoltaic properties of three new n-type conjugated polymers with the donor–acceptor structure comprising of electron-accepting naphthobisthiazole diimide (NBTDI) flanked by two 1,4-phenylene groups and various electron-donating moieties (1,4-phenylene, 2,5-thienylene and vinylene). The new polymers, poly(5,11-diphenyl-2,8-bis(2-decyltetradecyl)-benzothiazolo[4,5,6,7-lmn]thiazolo[5,4-f][3,8]phenanthroline-1,3,7,9(2H,8H)-tetrone)-alt-4,4′benzene [PNBTDIP], poly(5,11-diphenyl-2,8-bis(2-decyltetradecyl)-benzothiazolo[4,5,6,7-lmn]thiazolo[5,4-f][3,8]phenanthroline-1,3,7,9(2H,8H)-tetrone)-alt-2,2′thiophene [PNBTDIT], and poly(5,11-diphenyl-2,8-bis(2-decyltetradecyl)-benzothiazolo[4,5,6,7-lmn]thiazolo[5,4-f][3,8]phenanthroline-1,3,7,9(2H,8H)-tetrone)vinylene [PNBTDIV], whose molecular structures are shown in Scheme 1, were synthesized from the novel monomer 3 (5,11-bis(4-bromophenyl)-2,8-bis(2-decyltetradecyl)-benzothiazolo[4,5,6,7-lmn]thiazolo[5,4-f][3,8]phenanthroline-1,3,7,9(2H,8H)-tetrone). The new PNBTDIs were designed and synthesized with the aim of achieving (i) highly planar π-conjugated hexacyclic ring, enhanced molecular rigidity and co-planarity, and enhanced intermolecular π–π stacking compared to the corresponding NDI or BZT rings; (ii) low lying LUMO energies (∼−4.0 eV) essential to realize efficient electron injection under ambient conditions; (iii) good thermal oxidative stability and ambient air durability; and (iv) tunable HOMO/LUMO energy levels, charge transport, and optical properties through the donor–acceptor architecture.16 X-ray diffraction studies show that films of the PNBTDIs are lamellar crystalline with a very short intermolecular π–π stacking distance of 0.34–0.35 nm. We used OFET devices to investigate the charge transport properties of the PNBTDIs and found that they showed unipolar n-channel transport with electron mobilities of up to 1.5 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1. When used as electron acceptors in all-polymer solar cells by blending each PNBTDI with the donor polymer PSEHTT, the bulk heterojunction solar cells had a power conversion efficiency of 1.1–1.5%.

2.3. Characterization

1H and 13C-NMR spectra were recorded with a Bruker AV500 at 500 MHz and AV 300 at 300 MHz, respectively using CDCl3 as the solvent. Mass spectra were recorded on a Bruker Esquire LC/Ion Trap Mass spectrometer or a JEOL/HX-110 using 2-nitrophenyloctylether as a matrix. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis was performed on a TA instruments Q100 under N2 at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. TGA thermograms were recorded on a TA instruments Q50 TGA at a heating rate of 10 °C. UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer model Lambda 900 UV/vis/near-IR spectrophotometer. Solution UV-vis absorption spectra were taken in 10−6 M concentration in chloroform. Polymer thin films were prepared from 3 mg mL−1 solutions in chloroform and spin coated onto the glass substrates and dried in a vacuum oven at 30 °C for 1 h. Cyclic voltammetry was done on an EG&G Princeton Applied Research Potentiostat/Galvanostat 273A. A three-electrode cell was used, using platinum wire electrodes as both counter and working electrodes. Silver/silver ion (Ag in 0.1 M AgNO3 solution, Bioanalytical System, Inc.) was used as a reference electrode. Ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) was used as an internal standard. The potential values obtained in reference to Ag/Ag+ were converted to the saturated calomel electrode (SCE) scale. Thin film cyclic voltammetry was performed in acetonitrile containing 0.1 M TBAPF6. All solutions were purged with N2 for 20 minutes before each experiment and we used a blanket of N2 over the solution during the experiment. AFM characterization of the surface morphology of the active blend layers was done on a Veeco Dimension 3100 Scanning Probe Microscope (SPM) system using tapping mode in air. Gel Permeation Chromatography (GPC) analysis was performed using a Polymer Lab Model 120 Gel Permeation Chromatograph (DRI/High Sensitivity Refractive Index Detector and PL-BV400HT Viscometer) against polystyrene standards in chlorobenzene at 60 °C. Thin films of polymers were drop-cast on a glass substrate for X-ray diffraction (XRD). XRD patterns were obtained on a Bruker AXS D8 Focus diffractometer with Cu Kα beam (40 kV, 40 mA; λ = 0.15418 nm). Elemental analysis of the monomer and all polymers was done by Atlantic Microlab, Inc., USA.
2.4. Fabrication and characterization of thin film transistors
Organic field effect transistors were fabricated on a heavily n-doped silicon 〈100〉 substrate (0.002–0.004 Ω cm−1) which served as a bottom gate with 200 nm of the thermally grown SiO2 layer for the bottom gate dielectric (C ≈ 17 nF cm−2). The substrates were cleaned with sequential ultra-sonication in acetone and isopropanol followed by plasma treatment. The substrate surface was modified by octyltrichlorosilane (OTS 8) self-assembled monomer (SAM) by spin coating 0.1 M solution of OTS 8 in chloroform in air at 3000 rpm for 10 seconds followed by rinsing with toluene and drying at 100 °C for 10 minutes. The polymer thin films were fabricated on the OTS 8 modified substrate by spin coating each polymer solution (8 mg mL−1) in chloroform at 2000 rpm for 60 seconds followed by annealing at 200 °C for 10 minutes on the hot plate inside a glove box filled with argon. Silver source/drain electrodes with the channel length (L) of 100 μm and width (W) of 1000 μm were deposited by vacuum evaporation through a shadow mask. Electrical characteristics of the OFET devices were measured using a HP 4145B semiconductor parameter analyzer in the argon atmosphere.
2.5. Fabrication and characterization of solar cells
Solar cells with the inverted device structure of ITO/ZnO (30 nm)/polymer blend (70 nm)/MoO3 (10 nm)/Ag (100 nm) were fabricated. ITO/glass substrates were cleaned sequentially in ultrasonic baths of acetone, deionized water, and 2-propanol, and then dried at 60 °C in a vacuum oven overnight. ITO/glass substrates were treated with oxygen plasma before use. Zinc oxide (ZnO) precursor was spin-coated on top of the ITO and annealed at 250 °C for 1 h in air. The ZnO film thickness was approximately 30 nm and was confirmed by using an Alpha-Step 500 profilometer (KLA-Tencor, San Jose, CA). And then 1 vol% ethanolamine in 2-methoxyethanol was spin-coated onto the ZnO layer and dried at 110 °C for 10 min.3e The active layer was then spin-coated from the polymer blend solution to make a blend thin film of 60–80 nm thickness and thermally annealed at 175 °C for 10 min in a glovebox. Then the substrates were loaded in a vacuum thermal evaporator (BOC Edwards, 306) to deposit an anode composed of a thin layer of 10.0 nm MoO3 and 100 nm Ag under high vacuum (8 × 10−7 Torr). Five solar cells, each with an active area of 4 mm2, were fabricated per ITO/glass substrate. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of solar cells were measured using a HP4155A semiconductor parameter analyzer under laboratory ambient air conditions. An AM 1.5 illumination at 100 mW cm−2 was provided by a filtered Xe lamp and calibrated by using an NREL-calibrated Si diode. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured using a QEX10 solar cell quantum efficiency measurement system (PV Measurements, Inc., Boulder, CO) and was calibrated with a NREL-certified Si diode before measurement.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Synthesis
Three new copolymers PNBTDIP, PNBTDIT and PNBTDIV were synthesized in good yields (67–94%) by the Stille coupling polymerization of 5,11-bis(4-bromophenyl)-2,8-bis(2-decyltetradecyl)-benzothiazolo[4,5,6,7-lmn]thiazolo[5,4-f][3,8]phenanthroline-1,3,7,9(2H,8H)-tetrone (3) and 1,4-bis(tributylstannyl)benzene, 2,5-bis(trimethylstannyl)thiophene, and trans-1,2-bis(tributylstannyl)ethene, respectively, in the presence of Pd2(dba)3 and P(o-tol)3 in anhydrous chlorobenzene (Scheme 1). The new monomer (3) was synthesized from the neat one pot reaction of 1 equivalent of NDI dibromide (1) and 2.2 equivalents of 4-bromothiobenzamide (2).14 However, the observed yield (10%) of the dibromide (3) was low even after adding more equivalents of 2 and using a longer reaction time, leading to more uncharacterizable byproducts. To improve the yield of dibromide 3, the reaction was carried out in 1-butanol as a solvent under atmospheric air and refluxed for 40 h. After removal of solvents under reduced pressure, the crude product was purified by column chromatography, and then followed by reprecipitation in dichloromethane–hexane (1:5) mixtures to give dibromide (3) as a pure compound in 30% yield.
The structure of the new dibromide 3 was confirmed by 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR and mass spectra (Fig. S1 and S2, ESI†). The 1H-NMR spectrum of monomer 3 showed the N-methylene (–CH2) protons as a doublet at δ 4.35, and the methine (–CH) proton as a broad multiplet at δ 2.20 in addition to the remaining alkyl protons in the aliphatic region between δ 0.84 and δ 1.48. Furthermore, the protons on p-phenylene attached to the NBTDI moiety appeared as two doublets at δ 7.98 and δ 7.58 in the aromatic region of the 1H-NMR spectrum. In the 13C-NMR spectrum the –N–CH2– carbon appeared at δ 45.7, along with 12 carbon peaks in the region δ 115.2 to 178.3, which correspond to aromatic, imine and imide carbons of NBTDI and p-phenylene moieties. The structure of the new copolymers (PNBTDIs) was confirmed by 1H-NMR spectra. The 1H-NMR spectra of the PNBTDIs showed broad peaks at δ 0.61–2.20 and δ 4.38–4.47 for aliphatic and N-methylene protons of decyltetradecyl side chains, respectively, and the aromatic protons of the p-phenylene group attached to the NBTDI moiety appeared in the region between δ 6.15 and 7.63 (Fig. S3–S5, ESI†).
PNBTDIs are readily soluble (10–25 mg mL−1) in almost all organic solvents such as chloroform, chlorobenzene and 1,2-dichlorobenzene at room temperature. The number-average molecular weight (Mn), weight-average molecular weight (Mw) and the polydispersity index (PDI) of the copolymers, measured by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) in chlorobenzene at 60 °C using polystyrene standards, showed that the Mn values of PNBTDIP, PNBTDIT and PNBTDIV are 72.7, 81.0, and 88.8 kDa, respectively with PDIs of 3.08, 2.46 and 2.47 (Table 1). The thermal stability of the PNBTDIs was measured by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). TGA thermograms showed that PNBTDIs are thermally stable with high onset decomposition temperatures corresponding to 5% weight loss from 408 to 442 °C. DSC scans of PNBTDIs reveal that there is no phase transitions up to 300 °C, suggesting that the new polymers have good thermal stability and can be potentially annealed at elevated temperatures (Fig. S6 and S7, ESI†).

3.2. Optical properties

Fig. 1 shows the normalized optical absorption spectra of PNBTDIs in dilute chloroform (∼10−6 M) and as thin films. Both solution and thin film spectra showed two characteristic bands: (i) an absorption in the wavelength range of 310–420 nm, which corresponds to n–π* or π–π* transitions; and (ii) a relatively broad and intense absorption in the range of 460–662 nm, which corresponds to the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) between the strong electron accepting naphthobisthiazole diimide and the electron donating arylene subunits.16 In the solution spectra, the UV absorption maximum and the visible ICT peak are red shifted from 344 to 384 nm and 531 to 600 nm, respectively, the strength of the electron donating arylene moiety increases from benzene in PNBTDIP to thiophene in PNBTDIT (Fig. 1a). In solution, the visible region absorption maximum of PNBTDIP, PNBTDIT and PNBTDIV centered at 531, 585 and 600 nm, respectively. Similar to the solution spectra, the thin film absorption spectra of PNBTDIs were identical in shape but the vibronic structures were slightly enhanced. The thin film absorption spectra of PNBTDIP, PNBTDIT and PNBTDIV had peaks at 522, 622 and 599 nm, respectively. We note that whereas the absorption maximum (λmax) of PNBTDIV in the solid state is unchanged from its solution value, the λmax of the PNBTDIT thin film is red shifted compared to the solution, which is likely a result of the enhanced π-stacking interactions. In the case of the PNBTDIP thin film, the λmax appears to be blue shifted compared to the solution, however the appearance of a shoulder peak at 558 nm suggests that electronic delocalization is indeed enhanced in the solid state. The absorption edge optical band gap (Eoptg) of these n-type polymers varied from 2.02 eV in PNBTDIP to 1.73 eV in PNBTDIT (Table 1). The broad absorption bands in the UV-visible region and tunable optical band gaps (Eoptg) of the new PNBTDIs make them promising energy harvesting materials in all-polymer solar cells.

3.3. Redox properties and HOMO/LUMO energy levels
The electronic structures of the new PNBTDIs, highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)/lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels, were estimated by cyclic voltammetry (Fig. 2). Cyclic voltammograms (CVs) of two copolymers (PNBTDIP and PNBTDIT) showed irreversible oxidation waves with onset oxidation potentials (Eonsetox) of 1.45 and 1.20 V (vs. SCE), respectively, from which we estimated (EHOMO = eEonsetox + 4.64)18 HOMO energy levels of −6.09 and −5.84 eV. The observed 0.25 eV difference in the HOMO energy levels of these two copolymers is mainly due to the enhanced intramolecular charge transfer by increasing the strength of the electron donating moiety from benzene in PNBTDIP to thiophene in PNBTDIT. However, in the case of vinylene-linked PNBTDIV, the oxidation peak was not observed in the CV; therefore, the HOMO energy level was calculated from the optical band gap (EHOMO = Eoptg + ELUMO) to be −5.73 eV. The CVs of all three PNBTDIs showed irreversible reduction waves with onset reduction potentials of −0.70 to −0.78 V (Table 1). The corresponding LUMO energy levels of PNBTDIs were calculated to be −3.94 to −3.86 eV (ELUMO = eEonsetred + 4.64 eV). The relatively small difference (−0.08 eV) in the LUMO energy levels among the three polymers is due to the common electron-deficient naphthobisthiazole diimide moiety in the PNBTDIs. An electrochemical band gap (Eelg) of 2.17 eV in PNBTDIP and 1.90 eV in PNBTDIT is obtained from CV data. The observed discrepancy of 0.15–0.17 eV between the optical (Eoptg) and electrochemical (Eelg) band gaps in the PNBTDIs is attributed to the exciton binding energy of the polymer thin films.19 The rather low lying HOMO (<−5.8 eV) and LUMO (∼−3.9 eV) energies suggest that efficient injection and transport of electrons can be expected while hole injection and transport would be unfavorable, similar to the poly(naphthalene diimides).9b,10a,f

3.4. Morphology and molecular packing of PNBTDIs
We investigated the solid state morphology and crystallinity of the PNBTDIs by performing X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements on drop-casted films on glass substrates and annealed at 200 °C for 20 min. Fig. 3 shows the XRD patterns of PNBTDI films. The diffraction peaks and their d-spacings are listed in Table 2. A strong (100) reflection and associated weak (200) reflection were observed in all three PNBTDI copolymers, indicating good lamellar crystalline ordering in the films. The interlayer d-spacing (d100) corresponding to the (100) reflection was found to be 2.24–2.52 nm for the PNBTDIs (Table 2). This observed interlayer d100-spacing in the copolymers is significantly shorter than that expected of the alkyl side chain length of 4.3 nm (2 × C14), suggesting that there is strong interdigitation of the alkyl side chains between the polymer backbones. It is noteworthy to mention that a similar trend was observed in our previous studies on NDI–selenophene copolymers.9b,10a,f

Two additional broad and less intense diffraction peaks corresponding to d-spacings of 0.47 nm and 0.34–0.35 nm were also found in the XRD spectra of PNBTDI films (Fig. 3 and Table 2). The origin of the former reflection is not very clear but it might be associated with the lamellar (300) reflection. However, the latter d-spacing of 0.34–0.35 nm is due to the (010) reflection and thus π–π stacking in the copolymer films. We note that in the case of benzene-linked PNBTDIP and thiophene-linked PNBTDIT, the π–π stacking distance of 0.35 nm is slightly larger than in vinylene-linked PNBTDIV which is more co-planar. The π–π stacking distance (0.34–0.35 nm) of the PNBTDIs is significantly shorter compared to previously studied NDI–arylene copolymers (0.38–0.44 nm)9b,10a,f and this can be accounted for by the larger ring size and planarity of the NBTDI moiety.
4. Organic field-effect transistors (OFETs)
Top contact bottom gate organic field effect transistors were fabricated on heavily n-doped silicon with thermally grown oxide (200 nm) substrate to investigate the charge transport properties of PNBTDIs (Fig. 4 and S8, ESI†). Output and transfer characteristics of all PNBTDI OFETs showed clear current modulation and saturation with unipolar n-channel field-effect charge transport characteristics (Fig. 4a). The field effect mobility calculated from the saturation region of transfer characteristics at a Vds of 80 V showed electron mobility as high as 1.5 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PNBTDIV, and 1.0 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 each for PNBTDIT and PNBTDIP. PNBTDIs had moderate current on/off ratios of 103 to 105 and the threshold voltages range from 22 to 42 V. A factor of 10 higher electron mobility of vinylene-linked PNBTDIV compared to those of the other two copolymers could likely come from its higher molecular weight (Mn = 88.8 kDa) and shorter π–π stacking distance (0.34 nm). Overall, the fairly high electron mobility of PNBTDIs is mainly attributed to high molecular weight, lamellar crystallinity with strong interdigitation of polymer side chains, and the short π–π stacking distance of ∼0.35 nm (Tables 1 and 2). However, we note that the electron mobility of the PNBTDIs is 1–2 orders of magnitude lower compared to previously reported poly(naphthalene diimide)s (PNDIs),9,10a,f which is surprising since it could not be explained on the basis of molecular weight, lamellar crystalline ordering and LUMO energy level of the PNBTDIs.

5. All-polymer BHJ solar cells
The three new copolymers (PNBTDIP, PNBTDIT and PNBTDIV) were evaluated as electron acceptors in all-polymer bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells. Thiazolothiazole–dithienosilole copolymer, PSEHTT,4a was used as the electron donor polymer (Fig. 5a). The best donor/acceptor polymer blend weight ratio of the active layer was optimized and found to be 1:2 wt/wt; all the photovoltaic devices investigated here thus had this PSEHTT:acceptor polymer (1:2 wt/wt) blend composition. The devices have the inverted structure of ITO/ZnO (30 nm)/polymer blend (70 nm)/MoO3 (10 nm)/Ag (100 nm) (Fig. 5a). The devices were tested under AM 1.5 solar illumination at 100 mW cm−2 under ambient conditions. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics and external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the solar cells are shown in Fig. 5b and c, respectively. The photovoltaic parameters including the short-circuit current density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF), and power conversion efficiency (PCE) are summarized in Table 3.

All-polymer BHJ solar cells based on the new PNBTDI acceptors showed moderate and comparable power conversion efficiencies in the range of 1.1–1.5% (Table 3). The Voc (∼0.78 V) and fill factor (∼0.44) of the three blend systems were relatively unchanged but a slight variation in the Jsc (3.45–4.39 mA cm−2) was observed. The best device performance with a maximum PCE of 1.5% was observed for the PSEHTT:PNBTDIV blends with a Jsc of 4.39 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.78 V, and FF of 0.44. Fig. 5c shows the EQE spectra of the all-polymer BHJ solar cells. The EQE spectra all had a peak with an intensity of ∼19% in the UV region from 365 to 390 nm, while the maximum varied from 20 to 29% in the visible region (520–620 nm). Photocurrent generation in the UV region clearly comes from light absorption and exciton generation in the PNBTDI acceptors since the PSEHTT donor does not absorb at all in this region. However, both donor and acceptor polymers absorb and thus contribute to photocurrent generation in the visible region. AFM imaging was used to investigate the surface morphology of the active blend layers of the all-polymer solar cells (Fig. S9†). All three polymer/polymer blend systems showed a very similar phase-separated morphology with comparable root-mean-square (RMS) roughness values of 0.8–1.0 nm. The similarity of the observed morphology of the three different polymer/polymer BHJ devices is consistent with the observed comparable photovoltaic properties, including Voc, FF, and PCE values. Although the main reason for higher Jsc and PCE of PNBTDIV-based solar cells compared to the other n-type copolymers cannot be definitive based on all the present results, it appears that its order of magnitude superior electron mobility (1.5× 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1) and higher number-average molecular weight may be contributing factors. These initial photovoltaic results demonstrate that the new PNBTDIs could be promising acceptor materials in organic photovoltaic devices.
6. Conclusions
We have synthesized and characterized a novel monomer (5,11-bis(4-bromophenyl)-2,8-bis(2-decyltetradecyl)-benzothiazolo[4,5,6,7-lmn]thiazolo[5,4-f][3,8]phenanthroline-1,3,7,9(2H,8H)-tetrone), and polymerized it by Stille cross-coupling reaction to obtain a new class of n-type conjugated polymers, the poly(naphthobisthiazole diimide)s (PNBTDIs). These new n-type polymer semiconductors combined quite high molecular weights (Mn = 73–89 kDa, PDI = 2.46–3.08) with excellent solubility in organic solvents. X-ray diffraction analysis of neat films of the PNBTDIs revealed good lamellar crystalline ordering with a rather shorter intermolecular π–π stacking distance of 0.35 nm. The PNBTDIs have strong absorption bands in the visible region with optical band gaps of 1.7–2.0 eV. The three polymers all showed unipolar charge transport in thin film transistors with electron mobility that varied from 1 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 in PNBTDIP and PNBTDIT to 1.5 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 in PNBTDIV. As acceptors in all-polymer BHJ solar cells, the PNBTDIs gave a power conversion efficiency of up to 1.5%. These results show that naphthobisthiazole diimide is a promising building block for developing n-type polymer semiconductors in organic electronic applications.
