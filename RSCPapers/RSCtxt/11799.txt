    , Accepted 29th January 2019First published on 30th January 2019AbstractA novel type of chemically crosslinked liquid crystalline nanocomposite ionogel electrolyte based on poly(ionic liquid) (PIL) with superior ionic conductivity and high anisotropic conductivity was designed and synthesized using the in situ photopolymerization of sheared soft ionogels containing charged halloysite nanotubes (HNTs) and ionic liquid monomers. The oriented structure was investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). The chemically crosslinked backbone of the PIL and the addition of HNTs endowed the flexible ionogels with a combined very high modulus (up to 26.7 MPa) and mechanical strength (up to 4.4 MPa). Crucially, the obtained ionogels exhibited high mechanical stability even at temperatures up to 200 °C. Remarkably, in terms of the conductivities, the resulting pre-sheared ionogels displayed superior room temperature ionic conductivity (up to 6 mS cm−1) and a very high conductivity anisotropy ratio (up to 1600), owing to the alignment of the HNTs with oppositely charged surfaces and the high ionic conductivity of the polyelectrolyte PILs. Furthermore, flexible solid-state supercapacitor devices based on the high ion-conductive nanocomposite ionogels were fabricated, which demonstrated high and temperature-dependent specific capacitance, and remarkable cycling stability and flexible performance.
Introduction
Nowadays, flexible energy storage and conversion devices (batteries, supercapacitors, solar cells, etc.) have gained a tremendous amount of attention for use in industrial applications owing to their high power density, foldability, light weight, and low maintenance costs. In general, the performance of electrochemical devices depends strongly on the nature of the electrolyte used.1 However, the conventional aqueous or organic electrolytes still have many disadvantages, including liquid leakage, a low potential window, toxicity, and corrosivity, and also have the risks of combustion or explosion at high temperature, which can seriously reduce their safety level and restrict their practical applications.2–4 Replacing the liquid electrolyte with a solid electrolyte and gel electrolytes is critical to addressing these device issues. In addition, the development of excellent mechanical properties and improving the stability of the electrolyte has become another crucial task for the development of bendable, implantable, and wearable electronic products.5–7
Ionogels, based on ionic liquids (ILs), are promising candidates for a new generation of gel polymer electrolytes and are emerging as the main building blocks for flexible devices owing to their high ion mobility, wide electrochemical windows, nonflammability, electrochemical stability, and flexibility.8–10 Despite their considerable superiority, most ionogels are still unlikely to be used practically owing to their low room temperature ionic conductivity (10−5–10−3 S cm−1) and inferior mechanical properties (102–105 Pa).11–13 One of the main reasons is that the matrixes of most ionogels are conventional polymers, and they are insulators with high viscosity, which greatly reduces the density of ions and hinders the movement of ions.14,15 Significant efforts have been made to enhance the ionic conductivity of ionogels.16–18 In particular, poly(ionic liquid)s (PILs), a novel polyelectrolyte prepared by the direct polymerization of ionic liquid monomers, are recognized nowadays as being promising candidates for ionogels owing to their good compatibility with ionic liquids, and their higher conductivity compared with conventional polymers.19–26 Therefore, a novel poly(ionic liquid) (PIL)/ionic liquid (IL) based ionogel could provide ionogel materials with a combination of mechanical robustness and good ionic conductivity.27
In addition, the fabrication of well-organized channels and liquid crystalline (LC) nanostructures by using self-organization processes has attracted significant attention owing to the fact that the obtained ion conductive materials have aligned structures and a high ionic conductivity, and also anisotropic conductivity.28–32 The incorporation of anisotropic nanoparticles into a gel polymer electrolyte has attracted attention, because anisotropic nanoparticles can form a well-organized stable nanotubes/nanolayer and greatly improve the ionic conductivity, thermal stability, and mechanical strength of such nanocomposite electrolytes, which has been observed for carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and graphene oxide (GO).33–37 However, ionogels based on CNTs and GO fail during widespread applications, owing to weaknesses such as the high cost, poor dispersibility in ILs and reduced number of functional groups.
3-Dimensional (3D) halloysite nanotubes (HNTs) have been selected for use as the anisotropic nanofillers in the present study owing to their versatile advantages such as a very low-cost, high strength, being environmentally friendly, and their ease of dispersion in polymer and organic solvents.38–41 HNTs have been used as a multifunctional material in polymers, electronic components, drug delivery applications, cosmetics and protective and adsorption agents.42–46 Furthermore, HNTs, a natural nano-clay with a tubular structure, have received increasing attention as an electrode material for application in supercapacitors.47–50 Interestingly, our group fabricated a self-assembled LC phase and physical gelation behavior can be observed in the HNTs/IL system.51 More recently, it was reported that the highly charged clay nanotubes can order the ions in the 3D channels and form an organized structure on the outer surface, which can be used as high performance flexible electrolytes to improve the ionic conductivity of a battery.52
Herein, we report a novel and convenient methodology that combines a shear-induced orientation technique and an in situ photopolymerization method, for the first time to prepare highly anisotropic ionic conductive PIL-based ionogels with oriented natural HNTs. The obtained chemical-crosslinked ionogels have excellent mechanical properties and a good thermal-mechanical stability. Most importantly, this nanocomposite PIL-based ionogel demonstrates a superior ionic conductivity and a very high conductivity anisotropy ratio owing to the oriented highly charged nanotube and the highly ionic conductivity of the polyelectrolyte PIL. In addition, their potential application as a new electrolyte for flexible supercapacitors is explored in a wide temperature range and demonstrated advanced cycling, and a safe and flexible performance.
Experimental methods
Materials
Halloysite nanotubes were obtained from Guangzhou New Rare Metallurgical Chemical Industry Co. Ltd, Guangzhou, China, and purified on the basis of our previous work.53 The vinyl ILs of 1-vinyl-3-butylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (VBIMBF4) and 1-vinyl-3-butylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (VBIMTFSI) were purchased from Shanghai Cheng Jie Chemical Co. Ltd and used as received. The ILs of 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (BMIMBF4), 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (BMIMTFSI), polyethylene glycol (400) diacrylate [PEG(400)DA], and 2-hydroxy-4′-(2-hydroxyethoxy)-2-methylpropiophenone (photoinitiator) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received.
Preparation of the poly(ionic liquid)s-based ionogels
A certain quality of the HNTs (2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5 and 4.0 g) was dispersed in water (40, 50, 60, 70, and 80 ml) to obtain a dispersion using sonication (40 kHz, 100 W) for 6 h. Then, 10 g BMIMBF4 and 1.0 g VBIMBF4 (as the monomer) were added to the above described HNTs aqueous dispersion samples under magnetic stirring, and then the water was removed by distilling under a reduced pressure at 80 °C for 48 h to obtain a homogenous HNTs/IL mixture with weight fractions of 20, 25, 30, 35 and 40 wt% of HNTs, respectively (mass fraction with respect to the IL content). To this HNTs/IL mixture, 0.05 g PEGDA (as the crosslinker) and 0.02 g 2-hydroxy-4′-(2-hydroxyethoxy)-2-methylpropiophenone (as the initiator) were added and stirred for 1 h at 80 °C until the gel was optically homogenous. The obtained soft gels were sheared by casting, extruding or coating, and then the samples were put into an ultraviolet exposure chamber (SCIENTZ 03-II, Ningbo Scientz Biotechnology Co., Ltd). After being irradiated at a power of 50 W and a wavelength of 365 nm for 2 h chemically crosslinked nanocomposite 10%-PIL-ionogels with 20, 25, 30, 35, and 40 wt% of HNTs were obtained, and named 10%-PIL-ionogel-1, 10%-PIL-ionogel-2, 10%-PIL-ionogel-3, 10%-PIL-ionogel-4, and 10%-PIL-ionogel-5, respectively. The 20%-PIL-ionogels and 30%-PIL-ionogels samples were prepared using the same method. The samples based on BMIMTFSI and VBIMTFSI were also prepared using the same method. The chemical structures of the ILs, the crosslinker PEGDA, and the reaction scheme are given in Fig. 1. The content of each component in the ionogels is shown in Table S1.†

Preparation of supercapacitor devices
The supercapacitor device was prepared in a two-electrode configuration with a commercially available microporous activated carbon (YEC-8B, specific surface area of 2350 m2 g−1) as the electrode material and the ionogel as the electrolyte. For preparation of the electrode, the active material (85 wt%), graphite powder (5 wt%), and polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) binder (10 wt%,) were dissolved in N-methylpyrrolidone and stirred for 3 h to prepare a homogeneous slurry. The resulting slurry was brush coated onto a nickel foam current collector. The coated electrodes were dried overnight at room temperature and then vacuum dried at 100 °C in an oven for another 24 h. The electrodes were then pressed to make compressed electrodes. For preparation of the device, two such electrodes were pressed together sandwiching the ionogel between them and, the thickness of the ionogel films was about 200 μm.
Characterization
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the samples were obtained on a JEOL SEM 6700 operating at 5 kV, and the ionogel samples were first surface treated and then coated with platinum prior to the SEM observations. The mechanical properties were studied using a Linkam LINKSYS 32 tensile hot stage (Linkam, UK), at room temperature at a rate of 0.2 mm min−1. The rheological measurements were performed on a stress-controlled rheometer (TA-AR2000EX, TA Instruments) equipped with a parallel-plate geometry (25 mm diameter plates). Before conducting the oscillatory shear measurements, a strain sweep from 0.1 to 100% with a fixed frequency of 6.28 rad s−1 was performed for each dispersion to determine the linear viscoelastic regime. The chosen strains of 1–10% fell well within the linear viscoelastic regime for the frequency range of 0.1–100 rad s−1 in the oscillatory shear measurements. The experimental temperature was set at 25 °C. The dynamic temperature sweep measurements at an angular frequency of 6.28 rad s−1 were conducted from 25 to 200 °C with a heating rate of 1 °C min−1. For each sweep measurement, in order to ensure data reproducibility, three repeated specimens were examined. All measurements were conducted under a nitrogen atmosphere. Thermal analysis was performed using a PerkinElmer TGA 6 (PerkinElmer Instruments, USA). The temperature ranged from 25 to 800 °C with a heating rate of 15 °C min−1 under nitrogen. The ionic conductivities of the ionogels were measured using a Zahner IM6e electrochemical workstation (Zahner, Germany) over a frequency range from 1 Hz to 500 kHz at an AC oscillation of 10 mV. The measurements of the samples, which had a diameter of 4 mm and a thickness of 2 mm, were carried out in a cell, which consisted of a Teflon spacer sandwiched between two platinum coated stainless steel electrodes. The cell constant was determined using a 0.01 M KCl aqueous solution at 25 °C as the reference. The ionic conductivities were calculated from the bulk resistances obtained from the impedance spectra. The minimum in the Nyquist plot of the negative imaginary part of the impedance versus the real part of the impedance was taken as the sample resistance, R. The ionic conductivity, σ, was calculated as d/(RS), in which d and S are the thickness and the area of the sample, respectively. The gravimetric specific capacitance (F g−1) of a single electrode was calculated from the constant charge/discharge curve using the equation C = 2I·t/(m·V), in which I is the constant discharge current (A), t is the discharge time (s), m is the electroactive mass in the single electrode material (g), and ΔV is the operation voltage. The Fourier transform infrared spectra were recorded in the region of 400–4000 cm−1 for each sample on a Varian-640 spectrophotometer. The spectrum for each sample was obtained by averaging 32 scans over the selected wavenumber range and three specimens were analyzed to assess data reproducibility.
Results and discussion
Liquid crystalline properties of the ionogels
In general, anisotropic nanoparticles are ideal building blocks for functional materials owing to their unique anisotropic, optical, electronic, and mechanical properties. Importantly, anisotropic nanoparticles can form LC phases and precise control of the orientation and spatial arrangement can render these assemblies as ideal materials for photovoltaics, energy transportation, and many other technological applications.54 In this paper, soft LC ionogels are prepared with HNTs contents above 20 wt% owing to the self-organization behavior of HNTs nanoparticles in HNTs/BMIMBF4/VBIMBF4 dispersions (Fig. 2a). It should be noted that this dispersion cannot flow when the bottle is turned upside down, indicating that it is a gel-like sample. Furthermore, a similar gelation behavior can also be observed in HNTs/BMIMTFSI/VBIMTFSI dispersions (data not shown). To clarify the influence of the shear field on the LC behavior of this soft ionogel system, polarized optical microscopy (POM) observations were performed under a polarized optical microscope equipped with a shearing hot stage. Typical micrographs of the nanocomposite ionogels before and after shearing are shown in Fig. 2b–e. It should be noted that Fig. 2b and d show the polarized optical micrographs with the insertion of a sensitive tint plate and Fig. 2c and e show the polarized optical micrographs without insertion of the sensitive tint plate. It can be seen from Fig. 2b and c which show an ionogel with 30% HNTs that a strong birefringence with a planar texture is observed, which is a typical feature of a cholesteric phase (chiral nematic mesophase).53 The application of an external field (shear, electric, or magnetic field) is an important approach that is used to achieve high levels of alignment in LC systems.54 For example, a cholesteric phase can easily be changed into a nematic phase by drawing.55 Interestingly, a homogeneous strong birefringence and a typical feature of the nematic phase were observed under shear at a shear rate of 10 s−1, as shown in Fig. 2d and e. An interpretation of this phenomenon could be that the chiral nematic mesophase is converted into the uniaxially oriented nematic phase under shear flow. Importantly, this special soft ionogel demonstrates a different behavior with other LC systems: when the shear is stopped, the architecture is very stable and the shear-aligning regimes remain aligned forever, which will is of benefit in the processing of highly ordered materials.56–58 Therefore, it can be deduced that the highly aligned microstructure will generate ionic channels for ion transportation and significantly improve the ionic conductivity. It should be noted that the LC birefringence does not change for the ionogels before and after curing, as shown in Fig. S1.† Furthermore, the LC texture of this ionogel is very stable over a wide temperature range from 25 to 200 °C (Fig. S2†). This result indicates that the LC nanocomposite ionogel has promise for application as a novel electrolyte in high-temperature flexible electronic devices.

Synthesis and microstructure of the ionogels
The chemically crosslinked PILs-based nanocomposite ionogels with a nematic configuration were synthesized by photopolymerization of the compatible vinyl monomers VBIMBF4 or VBIMTFSI in the sheared soft LC ionogels of BMIMBF4/HNTs or BMIMTFSI/HNTs with PEGDA as the crosslinker (Fig. 1). Previous studies on HNTs demonstrated that the inner Al–OH face surface is positively charged, whereas the silica face surface is negatively charged.48,49,52 This opposite surface charge on the HNTs faces will separates the ILs as BF4− and TFSI− are absorbed on the inner positively charged Al–OH surface, and VBIM+/BMIM+ are accommodated on the outer negatively charged silica surface. Therefore, the polymer PILs on the outer HNTs surface that are polymerized from VBIM+ will become organized and conform to the HNTs nanoparticles.52,59 Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was used to confirm the polymerization and investigate the interactions between the IL electrolyte, PILs and HNTs, and the results are illustrated in Fig. S3.† The FTIR spectra of the neat HNTs show two bands located at 3695 and 3621 cm−1 which are associated with the stretching of the inner and inner-surface hydroxyl groups. The peak at 1634 cm−1 represents the deformation of the hydroxyl groups of water in the interlayer region.49 For the monomer IL of VBIMBF4, the characteristic bands of CC are displayed at 1658 cm−1. The two main spectral regions of PEGDA, the CC stretching (1618–1638 cm−1) and CO stretching (1723 cm−1) were also observed. Obviously, some considerable peaks shifts are observed in the spectra of the obtained nanocomposite ionogels. For example, the CC group peaks at 1658 cm−1 (VBIMBF4) and 1618–1638 cm−1 (PEGDA) disappeared, which proves that the polymerization has occurred and also reactions leading to the crosslinking. More importantly, the symmetrical stretching peak of the CO group at 1723 cm−1 (from PEGDA) is shifted to 1733 cm−1. This blue shift suggests the stronger interactions of the CO group with the HNTs (Si–O, Al–OH) and imidazolium cations are normally formed in ionogels. Furthermore, compared with the spectrum obtained for the neat HNTs, the characteristic absorption peaks have also shifted to higher wavenumbers and appear at 3670 and 3625 cm−1, which corresponds to the noncovalent interactions between the HNTs, polymer matrix and ILs.
Noticeably, these chemically crosslinked ionogels are easy to process into any shape owing to the fact that the precursor soft physical crosslinked ionogels can be sheared, extruded or pressed into any shape and keep their shape well. Fig. 3a shows a photo of the cable-like chemically crosslinked ionogels, and it can be knotted to create a loop. Moreover, the obtained ionogels possess a good self-supporting performance and can be bent and twisted, which demonstrates that these chemically crosslinked ionogels have good mechanical properties (Fig. 3b–d).

Fig. 4 shows the SEM images of the morphology and microstructure of the chemically crosslinked ionogels after shearing (20%-PIL-ionogel-4). It should be noted that the samples were surface treated before observation using SEM, which can clean up the IL and produce a gentle etch which allows observation of the architecture more directly and clearly. Obviously, after shearing, ionogels with a nematic configuration and excellent nanotubes arrays ordered parallel to the shear directions on the side surface sections can be seen in Fig. 4a and b. The same structure can be observed over the whole macroscopic area of the gel sample. Fig. 4c and d show a cross-section of the ionogel and the well-aligned nanotubes can also be observed, which demonstrates that high levels of alignment can be achieved in these nanocomposite ionogels during the simple shear process. Therefore, this highly aligned microstructure will provide a high-speed freeway for ion transportation and will significantly improve the ionic conductivity. Moreover, it can be deduced that this ordered structure will make the ionogel samples more uniform and endow them with a better mechanical strength.

Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) was also performed to study the formation of the shear-induced LC orientation. Two-dimensional (2D) SAXS patterns of the LC PIL-ionogels cured using pre-shear and without shear are displayed in Fig. 5. It can be seen that the 2D SAXS pattern of the LC ionogel without shear shows an elliptical diffusive image, suggesting that the nonaligned LC of the cholesteric phase may contain some irregular structures with a low orientation. This observation is quite similar to that found in our previous study on the LC behavior of aqueous halloysite nanotube dispersions.53 Interestingly, for the ionogels treated with pre-shear, the 2D SAXS pattern becomes very anisotropic and displays a more oval shape with two-lobes, which is the typical SAXS pattern for nematic liquid crystals. Similar behavior has been reported for GO and clay nanoparticles systems under shear.54,60–62

Viscoelastic properties of the ionogels
To study the dynamic viscoelasticities of the ionogels before and after curing in detail, rheological measurements were performed. Fig. 6a shows the changes in the storage modulus (G′) and loss modulus (G′′) as a function of the angular frequency for the 10%-PIL-ionogel-1 before curing. It can be observed that a gel behavior is observed over the entire range of explored frequencies, as indicated by the fact that the values of G′ are always higher than the values of G′′, and that the G′ is relatively independent of the frequency within the entire frequency range. In addition, the storage modulus at a frequency of 6.28 rad s−1 for the physical ionogel is in the order of 103 Pa, which shows a relatively weak mechanical strength. Obviously, after curing, the obtained nanocomposite ionogels show a typical rubberlike behavior (Fig. 6b), in which the G′ and G′′ become independent of the frequency and the values of G′ are always higher than G′′. More importantly, the chemically crosslinked ionogel has a much higher modulus (in the order of 105 Pa) than the physically crosslinked 10%-PIL-ionogel-1. It can also be seen from Fig. 6c that the modulus increases with the increasing content of the polymer matrix, indicating that a greater content of the polymer leads to an increase in the network density. For nanocomposite ionogels with 30% HNTs, the modulus increases from 0.1 to 1.1 MPa as the amount of PIL increases from 10 to 30%. Meanwhile, at a given polymer concentration, the modulus increases as the loading of HNTs increases. For the 30%-PIL-ionogel, the 30%-PIL-ionogel-4 with 35% HNTs has a much higher modulus (26.6 MPa) than the 30%-PIL-ionogel-1 sample with 20% HNTs (1.7 MPa), which indicates that a greater content of HNTs nanoparticles in the ionogels results in a stiffer structure. Temperature can negatively impact the stability of organic electronic devices and many advanced electrochemical devices require a greater mechanical stability at high temperature than can be afforded by common electrolytes. Importantly, the obtained nanocomposite ionogels are very stable and the storage modulus is not changed over a very wide range of temperatures from 25 to 200 °C, which has been confirmed using dynamic temperature sweep measurements, as shown in Fig. 6d. The reason for this is that the chemical crosslinking of the ionogels is very stable and the crosslinking densities remain unchanged below the decomposition temperature. The high thermal stability of the obtained ionogel was clearly confirmed by the mass-loss regimes from 300 °C in the thermogravimetric trace (TGA), as shown in Fig. S4.† These data suggest that the obtained nanocomposite ionogels with a high modulus, and good mechanical and thermal stability at a high temperature are desirable for use as novel electrolytes for preparing supercapacitors, Li batteries and dye-sensitized solar cells with higher operating temperatures than the electrolytes that are currently available.8,14

Mechanical properties of the ionogels
To further demonstrate the effects of the PILs and HNTs on the mechanical properties of these nanocomposite ionogels, tensile property tests were performed and the stress–strain curves are shown in Fig. 7, the values are shown in Table S2.† It can be clearly seen that the tensile strength increases with the increasing content of HNTs, while the elongation at break first increases and then decreases with the increasing content of HNTs. For the 20%-PIL-ionogels, with the addition of HNTs from 20 (20%-PIL-ionogel-1) to 40% (20%-PIL-ionogel-5), the tensile strength of the ionogels sharply increases from 0.4 ± 0.1 to 3.7 ± 0.3 MPa (an enhancement of about 900%), which is due to the uniform orientation of the nanotubes and the strong interactions between the polymer chains, IL and the HNTs via hydrogen bonding or electrostatic interactions. However, the elongation at break first increases from 23.5 ± 0.5% to 38.9 ± 0.6% when the HNTs content increases from 20 to 35%, then decreases to 20.6 ± 0.4% when the HNTs content is increased up to 40%. A possible reason for this is the increased tendency of nanoparticles to form agglomerates at higher contents of HNTs. Furthermore, the tensile strength increases with the increasing PIL content, while the elongation at break decreases with an increasing PIL content for ionogels with the same content of HNTs. For ionogels with 35% HNTs, the tensile strength increases from 2.9 ± 0.3 to 4.0 ± 0.2 MPa, while the elongation at break decreases from 43.9 ± 0.7% to 26.7 ± 0.6% upon increasing the PIL concentration from 10% to 30%. A possible reason for this is that the network densities of the ionogels with a higher content of PIL are higher than those of the ionogels with a lower PIL content. The values for the Young's modulus at the starting stage were obtained from the initial slopes of the stress–strain curves where the elastic deformation takes place (Table S2†). For the 20%-PIL-ionogels, the value of the Young's modulus sharply increases from 1.4 ± 0.2 to 18.5 ± 0.4 MPa as the amount of HNTs increases from 20% to 40%. For the ionogels with a HNTs content of 35%, the value for the Young's modulus increases from 8.1 ± 0.3 to 17.5 ± 0.4 MPa as the amount of PIL increases from 10% to 30%. This advantage makes it possible to prepare high performance flexible supercapacitors.

Anisotropy ionic conductivity of the LC nanocomposite ionogels
It is known that the alignment of nanostructures can lead to anisotropy of ionic conductivities.54 To demonstrate the anisotropic electrical properties of the LC nanocomposite ionogels, electrical conductivity was measured perpendicular (σ⊥) and parallel (σ||) to the electrodes. The room temperature ionic conductivity of σ⊥ and σ|| and the anisotropic factor as a function of the PIL and HNTs are shown in Fig. 8. It can be seen from Fig. 8a that the room temperature ionic conductivity of σ⊥ for the samples is greater than 1 mS cm−1. The values of σ⊥ decrease with the increasing PIL content, which due to the decrease in ionic content with the increasing PIL content, results in a reduction in the ion concentration. Meanwhile, the σ⊥ curves show an increase at first and then a decrease with the increasing HNTs content. The first increase in conductivity is mainly related to the LC structure and the greater alignment of the nanotube domains can give pathways for continuous ion transportation. However, the excess HNTs could decrease the conductivity of the ionogel, HNTs are an insulator and therefore an excess could mean that the reducing effect outweighs the impact from the alignment. Furthermore, the room temperature ionic conductivity of σ|| for the samples is on the order of 10−4–10−2 mS cm−1 and is far lower than that of σ⊥ (Fig. 8b). The reason for this is that HNTs are an insulator and the aligned nanotubes will prevent the migration of ions, and this blocking effect greatly deteriorates the ionic conductivity. The anisotropic factor (σ⊥/σ||) obtained from Fig. 8a and b is shown in Fig. 8c. It can be seen that the anisotropic factor increases with the increasing content of PIL and HNTs. Importantly, the values of the anisotropic factor (σ⊥/σ||) can reach 1.6 × 10−3 for the 30%-PIL-ionogel-5 with 40% HNTs and this is much higher than the anisotropic factor of 380 that was obtained in our previous work on BMIMBF4/HNTs hybrid ionogels with 40% HNTs, which is the highest level achieved in the series of IL gel systems.51 A similar anisotropic ionic conductivity behavior can also be observed in the BMIMTFSI/PIL/HNTs ionogels (Fig. S5†).

To interpret the reason for the superior anisotropic ionic conductivity and the relationship between the microstructure and this property, we proposed schematic structures and an ion transport mechanism for the oriented nanocomposite ionogels in two directions, perpendicular (σ⊥) and parallel (σ||) to the electrodes, as shown in Fig. 9. The image on the left for the room temperature ionic conductivity of σ⊥ shows very fast ion transportation and a high ionic conductivity (10−3–10−2 S cm−1). The reason for this is not only the formation of well-organized HNTs that can provide a continuous superhighway for ion transportation in the lumen of the nanotubes, but also the special regioregularity of the structure and the high ionic conductivity of the PILs located between the well-organized HNTs. On the other hand, the room temperature ionic conductivity of σ|| on the right shows a slow ion transportation and a very low ionic conductivity (10−5 S cm−1), as the aligned insulating nanotubes can prevent the migration of ions and this blocking effect greatly deteriorates the ionic conductivity. Therefore, these ionogels display a high anisotropic ionic conductivity and the anisotropic factor can reach 10−3, which could cause anisotropic electrical response behavior and therefore can be used in sensors, actuators, and transducers.

The Arrhenius plots for the temperature dependent conductivity of the two aligned samples (σ⊥ and σ||) is presented for 20%-PIL-ionogel-1 in Fig. 10. Each curve was repeated three times and the standard deviations are shown in the figure. It can obviously be seen that the ionic conductivity monotonously increases with the increasing temperature, and therefore the ionic mobility increases with the increasing temperature. Importantly, the ionic conductivities of σ⊥ are far larger than σ||. For example, the ionic conductivity σ⊥ can reach 2.5 × 10−3 S cm−1 at 20 °C, which is 397 times higher than that of σ||, which is 6.3 × 10−6 S cm−1 at 20 °C. Furthermore, the anisotropy factor (σ⊥/σ||) exhibits a gradual decline with the increasing temperature and changes from 397 to 27 when the temperature increases from 20 to 120 °C.

Electrochemical stability of the LC nanocomposite ionogels
It is known that electrochemical stability is a very important index for electrolytes and that it directly affects the stability and the capacity of the battery or supercapacitor. Therefore, a wide anodic electrochemical window is beneficial for the fitting of better electrodes. The electrochemical stability of these ionogels was measured by applying linear sweep voltammetry. As seen from Fig. 11, these nanocomposite ionogels exhibit an excellent electrochemical stability and the electrochemical window of all of the samples is greater than 4.0 V, which is useful for the preparation of advanced supercapacitor with non-aqueous electrolytes. Furthermore, the electrochemical window of these nanocomposite ionogels increases with the increasing content of HNTs, indicating that HNTs can act as a stabilizer and can enhance the electrochemical stability of the nanocomposite PIL-ionogels.

Electrochemical performance of the supercapacitor devices
A supercapacitor cell with a symmetric two-electrode configuration was fabricated using a commercial microporous activated carbon (YEC-8B, specific surface area of 2350 m2 g−1) as the electrode material and the LC nanocomposite PIL-ionogel film (with a thickness of about 400 μm) as the electrolyte, as shown in Fig. 12a. It can be seen from Fig. 12b that the cyclic voltammetry (CV) curve in the potential range from 0 to 3.0 V of the device exhibits a typical rectangular shape, indicating an electrical double-layer behavior in the gel polymer electrolyte. Furthermore, the rectangular shape can be retained well when the scan rate is increased from 5 to 50 mV s−1, suggesting that the cell possesses a fast and reversible charge storage process. The specific capacitance of the device was evaluated as being 175.8, 169.1, and 160.9 F g−1 using the galvanostatic charge/discharge measurement at 1, 2 and 4 A g−1 (Fig. 12c). Fig. 12d shows the Nyquist plot of the activated carbon electrode in the nanocomposite LC ionogel electrolyte. In the high frequency region of the Nyquist plot, the bulk (Rb) and charge-transfer resistances (Rct) of the device were calculated from the intercepts of the approximate semicircle with the real axis at 7.5 Ω (Rb) and 7.3 Ω (Rct). Therefore, an internal resistance (the sum of Rb and Rct) of 14.8 Ω can be obtained. It should be noted that possible reasons for the deformation of Nyquist plot in the high frequency region include the surface roughness of the electrode, the heterogeneity of the electrode/electrolyte interface and the conductivity of the electrolyte.63,64 The curve also exhibits an approximate vertical line in the low frequency region, indicating that the device possesses good ion diffusion at the electrolyte/electrode interface and represents an ideal supercapacitor. The cycle ability of the electrodes in the electrolyte is one of the most important factors for their practical application. The cyclic stability of the flexible device was evaluated by using the galvanostatic charge/discharge method at a current density of 1 A g−1 with a potential range from 0 to 3.0 V. Remarkably, the specific capacitance of device was maintained at over 95.2% of the original capacitance and the columbic efficiency of the system was found to be 96.1% after 5000 cycles, as shown as in Fig. 12e. These data suggest that the supercapacitor device has an excellent cycling stability.

The cyclic voltammograms obtained at different temperatures in the potential range from 0 to 3.0 V are shown in Fig. 13a. As the temperature increased from 25 °C to 120 °C, the shape of the CV curves measured at 10 mV s−1 became increasingly rectangular. Furthermore, the specific capacitance that was estimated from the CV curve increased from 175.6 F g−1 to 277.4 F g−1, in accordance with the enhanced conductive trends at various temperatures. This result is comparable to or higher than that measured for other supercapacitors prepared from an activated carbon electrode with an IL or ionogels electrolyte.65–67 In addition, the flexibility of the device was studied and the CV curves were recorded in the potential range from 0 to 3.0 V under the bent and twisted state, as shown in Fig. 13b. It can be seen that there is almost no change for the device under the bent or twisted states compared with the device in the original flat state. Therefore, this superior performance means that these LC nanocomposites PIL-based ionogels can be easily used as novel gel electrolytes in high-temperature flexible supercapacitors.

Conclusions
In summary, we fabricated LC HNTs/PIL nanocomposite ionogel electrolytes via a shear-induced method and in situ photopolymerization. The obtained novel structured materials were composed of aligned HNTs connected by chemically crosslinked PIL chains, and exhibited excellent mechanical and thermal properties. The ion transportation is guided by the well-ordered nanostructure and the high conductivity of the polyelectrolyte PILs, leading to high ionic conductivity and anisotropic conductivity in the ionogels. In particular, conductivity anisotropy factors as high as 1600 have been achieved. The fabricated supercapacitors based on these obtained ionogels possess excellent temperature dependent electrochemical properties. Moreover, the cycling stability and excellent flexibility were confirmed by the good performance stability over 5000 cycles and under normal and bent states. This work paves the way for the design of novel ionogel electrolytes with excellent electronic and mechanical properties for use in long-lasting, flexible, and even wearable, electronic devices.
