    , Accepted 6th September 2018First published on 6th September 2018AbstractSolar-energy-driven overall water splitting using sustainable energy resources is extremely desirable for high purity hydrogen fuel production, and one of the ways is to couple cost-effective solar cells in series with earth-abundant electrocatalysts for oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions, OER and HER, respectively. Developing highly efficient and earth-abundant electrocatalysts however remains one of the grand challenges. Herein, we developed biomass (duckweed, DW) derived N,S-doped mesoporous carbon matrix supported NiFe-alloy nanoparticles (NPs) as efficient electrocatalysts for overall water splitting. While the annealed catalyst required 267 mV overpotential at 10 mA cm−2 for the OER, the best HER performance was demonstrated by the unannealed electrocatalyst requiring 106 mV at −10 mA cm−2 in 1 M KOH. For overall water splitting, this couple required only 1.61 V cell voltage to deliver 10 mA cm−2, with continuous release of O2 and H2 gas bubbles for more than 200 h. On integrating with perovskite solar cells, the homologous DW electrolyzer exhibited unassisted solar-energy-driven overall water splitting with a solar-to-hydrogen (STH) conversion efficiency of 9.7%.
Introduction
Electrochemical water splitting leading to molecular hydrogen with its high energy storage density and zero carbon emission is widely considered to be a promising strategy for clean and renewable energy production.1,2 Especially, the electrolyzer coupled to a photovoltaic module for solar light driven hydrogen generation is an optimistic sustainable energy conversion system,3,4 since it is easier to integrate industrial electrolysis and electrodeposition systems for practical and scalable applications. However for efficient solar-energy-driven photovoltaic-assisted overall water splitting, highly robust and efficient electrocatalysts are necessary. Producing high purity hydrogen on a large scale still remains a major challenge because of its uphill reaction requiring a cell voltage of 1.8–2.0 V, noticeably higher than the minimum theoretical potential of 1.23 V.5 This prodigious overpotential of commercial electrolyzers is associated with the sluggish anodic OER and fairly facile cathodic HER. Overcoming the benchmark but scarce and high cost electrocatalysts for the OER and HER such as Ir and Ru-based compounds and Pt-based alloys, respectively, enormous efforts have been devoted to developing low cost and earth-abundant electrocatalysts such as metal oxides,6,7 alloys (NiCo8 and NiFe9), phosphides,10 carbides,11 sulfides,12 selenides,13 borates,14 and even carbon based nanocatalysts.15 NiFe bimetallic alloys are one of the widely studied alloys although their activity is constrained by moderate electronic conductivity and instability.2,9,16–18
One of the usually adopted ways to overcome the limitations of electron transport in the catalyst is to employ an electrically conducting catalyst support such as graphitic carbon. Carbon is particularly interesting since it can be functionalized easily depending on the targeted application,19 can be made electrically conducting,20 and can be doped with heteroatoms (such as N and S) to create highly active catalytic sites.21 The common routes to heteroatom-doped carbon such as thermal treatment with heteroatom-rich precursors, such as melamine and NH3, have disadvantages such as high cost, low yield and low heteroatom doping, which restrain its large-scale production. As a result the research on doped carbon materials has moved from expensive, hazardous inorganic and organic chemicals to renewable biomass precursors.22 DW is a typical biomass waste found in lakes, which arouses serious environmental problems due to its rapid growth during summer, and is rich in nitrogen, sulfur, and carbon. Such a bio-waste precursor is extremely fascinating in designing low-cost and environmentally benign materials for large-scale use.23–29
We demonstrate a novel and facile approach for one-step carbonization of DW without any activation step and templating agent, towards the design of an electrocatalyst system consisting of bimetallic NiFe alloy NPs supported on an N,S-doped carbon material with a decent surface area. This bifunctional electrocatalyst system requires a cell voltage of only 1.61 V at 10 mA cm−2 for overall alkaline water splitting and demonstrates exceptional stability even under harsh alkaline conditions, superior to most of the electrocatalysts reported so far. It is worth mentioning here that in order to endure overall water splitting both half reactions (OER and HER) should be carried out in the same electrolytic environment whereby utilizing a bifunctional electrocatalyst or two homologous OER and HER catalysts originating from the same source can improve the chances of commercialization. Moreover because of the high solubility of the catalyst in acidic electrolytes, alkaline water splitting has found widespread commercialization, whereas designing an electrolyzer operating under a strongly alkaline environment is sporadically achieved and remains a major challenge.2 Besides fulfilling the above criteria, the DW derived electrolyzer integrated with the perovskite solar cell module yields a fairly stable water splitting photocurrent with a STH conversion efficiency of 9.7%, corroborating its chances for practical and scalable applications.
Results and discussion
Structural and morphological characterization
When the pre-carbonized DW is mixed with Ni- and Fe-salt solutions and carbonized in an inert atmosphere at 800 °C, a bimetallic NiFe alloy NP supported N,S-doped carbon (NF-8) catalyst is obtained, which is further annealed at 1000 °C to get the NF-8-A catalyst. The catalysts were usually carbonized at 800 °C unless stated otherwise. Fig. 1a shows a schematic representation of the formation of NF-8 and NF-8-A wherein DW with an abundant source of carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur is useful for promoting the in situ doping of N and S into the carbon matrix. The pre-carbonized DW mainly consists of thick carbon blocks (Fig. S1a, ESI†) which transform to a fluffy porous carbon matrix (DW-800) after carbonization at 800 °C (Fig. 1b and Fig. S1b, ESI†). DW-800 has an apparent disordered stacking of graphite-like planes because of the doped heteroatoms,30 as revealed from the high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image and the corresponding selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (Fig. 1c). The scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM)-high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) imaging with elemental mapping shows uniform distribution of the heteroatoms (Fig. 1d) along with their quantitative estimation by energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDAX) (Fig. S2, ESI†). The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern shows distinct (002) and (100) reflections according to JCPDS 75-1621 with a low degree of graphitization (Fig. S1c, ESI†). In Raman spectral analysis of DW-800, the ratio of the disordered (D) band at 1350 cm−1 to the graphitic (G) band at 1600 cm−1 is 1.15 (Fig. S1d, ESI†) whereas when carbonized differently, the D/G ratio is 0.67 and 0.85 for DW-700 and DW-900, respectively. Accompanied by the presence of 4.5–5.5 nm mesopores, the specific surface area for DW-700, DW-800 and DW-900 is 16.5, 134.5 and 353.5 m2 g−1, respectively, increasing steadily with carbonization temperature starting from an incomplete carbonization at 700 °C to a high volatilization rate of gaseous molecules at 900 °C (Fig. S1e and f, ESI†). The type-IV nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms show capillary condensation typical for mesoporous structures (Table S1, ESI†).31 The electrical conductivity of 0.043 ± 0.0033 × 10−4, 0.032 ± 0.0003 × 10−2 and 0.63 ± 0.003 S m−1 measured with a two-point probe method shows a similar increasing trend from DW-700 to DW-800 and DW-900, respectively (Fig. S1g–i, ESI†). Overall, DW derived heteroatom doped carbon has the properties of a high specific surface area with interconnected mesopores, high density of defect sites and decent conductivity to enable its use as a catalyst support facilitating mass diffusion, electron mobility and exposure of active sites.

The carbon supported bimetallic NixFey alloy NPs were optimized either at different carbonization temperatures keeping the x:y ratio fixed or vice versa. Fig. 2a shows the XRD patterns of 1:1 NiFe NP samples carbonized at 700 (NF-7), 800 and 900 °C (NF-9) and Fig. S3 (ESI†) shows the XRD patterns of NF-8 (x:y = 1:2, 2:1), NF-8 (x:y = 1:1) annealed at 900 °C and NF-8-A. The sharp XRD reflections correspond to the face centered cubic (FCC) Ni–Fe alloy according to JCPDS 47-1417. A small but distinct impurity peak of γ-Fe2O3 (JCPDS 39-1346) is observed for only NF-7, originating from partial surface oxidation.32 The slight peak shifts towards a lower 2θ angle from those reported for FCC Ni (JCPDS: 04-0850), which implies successful incorporation of Fe atoms into the Ni structure (Fig. 2b). The G (002) reflection from graphitic carbon is present in all the samples albeit with lower intensities in NF-8 and NF-9 (Fig. S4, ESI†). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is used to probe the surface composition and the oxidation states of Ni and Fe in NF-8 (Fig. S5,† ESI). The Fe 2p and Ni 2p spectra confirm the existence of a metallic NiFe alloy. However due to surface oxidation and XPS being surface phenomena, +2 and +3 oxidation states of Ni and Fe are also observed. All the samples possess almost similar metal content and ∼65 wt% C (Table S2 and S3, ESI†), confirmed from EDAX analyses averaged over multiple places, necessary for an effective comparison of their catalytic performances. In the Raman spectra the two overlapping peaks were deconvoluted into four individual peaks (D1, D3, D4, and G) to identify the structural features of the graphene layers (Fig. 2c–e), while the G band is the E2g vibration of the defect-free sp2 carbon structures; among the defect bands, D1 is related to the A1g symmetric vibration mode of graphitic domains activated by edge plane defects generated due to heteroatom doping,33 D3 at ∼1500 cm−1 is due to amorphous carbon and the D4 band has been tentatively assigned to the occurrence of polyene-like species. A high density of edge plane defects has a significant correlation with the electron-transfer activation;34 in other words, a larger ID1/IG intensity ratio corresponds to a faster electron transfer rate and enhanced catalytic activity. The ID1/IG ratio of NF-8 (1.49) is much larger than those of NF-7 (0.94) and NF-9 (0.96), indicating that 800 °C is the optimum temperature for retaining large defect sites. The higher amount of heteroatom doping at 800 °C is ascertained from the red shift in the D1 band position of NF-8 (1355 cm−1) as compared to NF-7 (1365 cm−1) and NF-9 (1360 cm−1).35 Moreover, theoretical calculations have shown that the edge plane defects created due to heteroatom doping are highly active towards the HER, thus significantly decreasing the Gibbs free energy of H* absorption (ΔGH*) on graphene.36 Here too type IV sorption isotherms are observed and the specific surface areas are 36.2 m2 g−1 (NF-7), 116.5 m2 g−1 (NF-8) and 64.1 m2 g−1 (NF-9) (Fig. S6 and Table S1, ESI†). Along with the NP growth with increasing temperature, mesopores with 3.5–4.0 nm diameters also collapse, thereby decreasing the micropore volume from 0.04237 cm3 g−1 (NF-8) to 0.01425 cm3 g−1 (NF-9). The electrical conductivity values are 4.79 ± 0.13 S m−1 (NF-7), 15.97 ± 0.25 S m−1 (NF-8), and 12.52 ± 0.1 S m−1 (NF-9) (Fig. S7, ESI†), considerably higher than those of DW-700, 800, and 900, suggesting the creation of new conduction pathways in the presence of conducting bimetallic NiFe alloy NPs.

TEM, HRTEM and STEM-HAADF images with the corresponding elemental maps of (f–h) NF-8 and (i–k) NF-8-A, respectively. Insets show the corresponding size distribution histograms (f and i) and SAED patterns (g and j). 
All the as-prepared and annealed NiFe NP coated carbon samples have a similar porous morphology to DW-800, suggesting that porosity is not altered by the incorporation of metal alloy NPs (Fig. S8, ESI†). Fig. 2f–k show the two-dimensional morphological characterization of NF-8 and NF-8-A. The successfully embedded and uniformly dispersed NiFe alloy NPs in NF-8 and NF-8-A have an average diameter of ∼80 and ∼106 nm, respectively (Fig. 2f and i). In the high resolution TEM images (Fig. 2g and j), the lattice spacing of 0.34 nm and 0.21 nm correspond to the (002) plane of graphitic carbon and the (111) plane of the FCC NiFe alloy, respectively. EDAX data (Fig. S2, ESI†) and the STEM-HAADF image with elemental maps (Fig. 2h and k) confirm their uniform distribution. In Raman spectral analyses (Fig. S9, ESI†), the monotonous decrease of ID1/IG intensity ratio from NF-8 (1.49) to NF-8-A (0.91) as well as the blue shift in the D1 band position from 1355 to 1363.5 cm−1 suggests that annealing increases the graphitic nature which reduces the edge plane defect sites due to the decrease in heteroatom content (Table S4, ESI†).37 Also higher annealing temperatures increase the specific surface area and micropore volume with better distribution of pore size, due to more volatilization of gaseous molecules (Fig. S10 and Table S1, ESI†).
Electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction
The OER performance of the electrocatalysts was investigated using a typical three-electrode setup in 1 M KOH solution. Fig. 3a shows the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) polarization curves at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 to ensure the steady-state behavior at the electrode surface.38 The OER activity of NF-8 and NF-8-A is compared with those of IrO2, the 1:1 Ni:Fe-800 oxide composite (without C), the bimetallic 1:1 Ni:Fe alloy (without C), Fe-800 and Ni-800 (both with C), DW-800 and bare CFP with the same mass loading under similar conditions. Since the as-measured current does not reflect the intrinsic behavior of the catalysts due to ohmic resistance, an iR correction was employed for further analysis.39 As displayed in Fig. 3a and b, NF-8-A and NF-8 attain a current density of 10 mA cm−2 at overpotentials of 267 and 314 mV, respectively, the former being superior to that of the benchmark IrO2 (η10 = 282 mV) as well as other reported catalysts, suggesting that the alloy with a 1:1 ratio of Ni:Fe, and 800 °C carbonization and 1000 °C annealing temperature are the optimized conditions (Fig. S11a, S12a, S13a and c, S14a, S15a, and S16c, ESI†). For a comparison with CFP, the OER activities were also investigated on a 2D glassy carbon electrode with a small catalyst loading of 0.5 mg cm−2 wherein NF-8-A remains the best performing OER catalyst. As expected the activity and stability of the catalyst NPs on glassy carbon is poor as compared to the CFP substrate due to poor electron flow, bubble accumulation on the catalyst surface hindering the mass diffusion of reactants and products, as well as blocking of active sites by the Nafion binder (Fig. S17,† ESI). The OER kinetics was also characterized using the Tafel slope, derived from the LSV polarization curves using the Tafel equation: η = blog(j) + a(1)where η is the overpotential, j is the current density and b the Tafel slope. The annealed catalyst exhibits the smallest Tafel slope of 87 mV dec−1, close to the state-of-the-art IrO2 (86 mV dec−1), suggesting the most favorable OER kinetics (Fig. 3c). Additionally, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were conducted to further investigate the interfacial interactions and electrode kinetics of the electrocatalysts during the OER. The Nyquist plots in Fig. S18a (ESI†) recorded at an η of 372 mV reveals that NF-8-A possesses the least charge transfer resistance (RCT) suggesting fast electron transfer kinetics at the interface between the electrode and electrolyte. The superior activity along with improved kinetics is corroborated from the estimation of electrochemical double-layer capacitance (Cdl), which is again directly proportional to the ECSA.38 The annealed catalyst has a Cdl of 168 mF cm−2 which is much higher than those of NF-8 (28.1 mF cm−2), bimetallic 1:1 Ni:Fe alloy (0.66 mF cm−2) and DW-800 (0.21 mF cm−2) suggesting that the higher Cdl and enhanced specific surface area of the former corroborate its superior electrocatalytic activity for the OER (Fig. S19, ESI†).

One of the major limiting factors for the large-scale application of an OER electrocatalyst is its long-term durability. The chronoamperometry test confirms the excellent long-term stability of NF-8-A and NF-8 for 50 h at an overpotential of 305 and 344 mV, respectively, and the overlapping LSV curves taken before and after the durability test assert the retention of active sites along with high catalytic activity (Fig. 3d). Post OER experiments, the XRD patterns of the catalysts mirror the reflections before the test, confirming the long-term phase stability under OER conditions except for a few new peaks corresponding to β-Ni(OH)2 (JCPDS 14-0117) formed on the outer surface (Fig. S20a, ESI†). The field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) images taken after the 50 h test suggest that the fluffy porous morphology is retained after bulk electrolysis (Fig. 3e and f). The faradaic efficiency of NF-8-A and NF-8 was measured by collecting the actual amount of oxygen gas evolved at a constant potential of 0.9 V vs. Ag/AgCl, by using a water displacement method. Both the catalysts show excellent energy conversion efficiency with faradaic efficiencies of 97.5 and 94.4%, respectively (Fig. 3g), suggesting that almost all the charge is consumed for oxygen evolution without any noticeable side reactions.
Electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction
The HER performance of NF-8-A, NF-8, the 1:1 Ni:Fe-800 oxide composite (without C), the bimetallic 1:1 Ni:Fe alloy (without C), Fe-800 and Ni-800 (both with C), DW-800, Pt/C (40 wt%) and bare CFP was investigated under similar conditions. The benchmark Pt/C exhibits the highest HER activity with an extremely low overpotential of 20 mV at −10 mA cm−2. It is interesting to find that the NF-8 requires the lowest overpotential of 106 mV at −10 mA cm−2 relative to its annealed counterpart (215 mV) (Fig. 4a and b), also outperforming the other electrocatalysts (Fig. S11b, S12b, S13b and d, S14b, S15b, and S16d, ESI†). Changing the substrate or lowering the catalyst loading also maintains the superior HER activity of NF-8 (Fig. S17b,† ESI). As expected, Pt/C demonstrates the smallest Tafel slope of 58 mV dec−1 suggesting that the HER taking place on Pt/C follows the Volmer–Heyrovsky mechanism with Volmer step of electrochemical desorption as the rate-determining step,40 whereas NF-8 also shows a small Tafel slope of 90 mV dec−1 suggesting a similar HER mechanism (Fig. 4c). The superior catalytic performance of Pt/C and NF-8 towards the HER was reconfirmed by their smallest RCT (Fig. S18b, ESI†). Though the specific surface area and the ECSA of NF-8 is lower than those of NF-8-A, the presence of high density HER active edge plane defect sites (larger ID1/IG band intensity ratio) along with sufficient specific surface area and ECSA attests to its better electrochemical HER activity. The chronoamperometry test demonstrates the long term stability of NF-8 for 50 h at a 312 mV overpotential (Fig. 4d). The LSV curve taken after the stability test matches with the initial LSV curve (Fig. 4d inset), suggesting that the active sites are retained along with the porous morphology and crystallographic phase (Fig. 4e and S20a, ESI†).

(f) Faradaic efficiency measurement of NF-8 showing the theoretically calculated and experimentally measured H2 gas with time at −1.45 V vs. Ag/AgCl. 
To confirm that the high HER activity is indeed intrinsic instead of any possible Pt contamination, we measured the HER activity of NF-8/CFP using a graphite rod and Pt wire as counter electrodes and found all the LSV polarization curves to have a similar trace (Fig. S21, ESI†). The HER faradaic efficiency of the NF-8 was measured by collecting the actual amount of H2 gas catalyzed at a constant potential of −1.45 V vs. Ag/AgCl using a water displacement method. This catalyst shows a faradaic efficiency of 99%, indicating high energy-conversion efficiency (Fig. 4f).
Electrochemical overall water splitting
A two-electrode alkaline electrolyzer cell was constructed with the best performing HER catalyst NF-8 as the cathode and the OER catalyst NF-8-A as the anode. For comparison NF-8 was also employed as a bifunctional electrocatalyst. For a two electrode configuration, the net cell voltage required to achieve a particular current density for overall water splitting should be close to the potential difference between the two half reactions. In order to verify this, the steady state polarization curves were recorded (Fig. 5a and b) which indicate that the expected cell voltage at 10 mA cm−2 for the NF-8 (−) ∥ NF-8-A (+) and NF-8 (−) ∥ NF-8 (+) electrolyzers should be close to 1.603 and 1.65 V, respectively. As demonstrated in the LSV polarization curve in Fig. 5c, the NF-8 (−) ∥ NF-8-A (+) electrolyzer delivers a current density of 10 mA cm−2 at a cell voltage of 1.61 V very close to the estimated cell voltage of 1.603 V and is only 60 mV higher than that of the benchmark Pt/C (−) ∥ IrO2 (+) electrolyzer which requires 1.55 V in 1 M KOH (Fig. 5d). In comparison the NF-8 (−) ∥ NF-8 (+) electrolyzer requires 1.65 V to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm−2, matching exactly with the cell voltage estimated in Fig. 5b. The cell voltage of the NF-8 (−) ∥ NF-8-A (+) electrolyzer (1.61 V) is lower than those of most of the recently reported electrolyzers constructed using other transition-metal-based electrocatalysts (Table S5, ESI†).

(c) LSV polarization curves of the two-electrode setup for overall water-splitting in 1 M KOH (iR uncorrected) and (d) the required cell voltage to achieve 10 mA cm−2. (e) Chronoamperometry of water electrolysis at a cell voltage of 2 V for the NF-8 (−) ∥ NF-8-A (+) electrolyzer. The left inset in (e) shows the LSV curves before and after the durability test and the right inset shows the optical images of O2 and H2 bubbles generated during the test. 
Bulk electrolysis of the NF-8 (−) ∥ NF-8-A (+) couple at a constant cell voltage of 2 V shows stable current output with a vigorous release of gas bubbles at the respective electrodes for at least 200 h (Fig. 5e). The LSV plot taken after the stability test shows an improved activity possibly because of the activation of the catalyst (Fig. 5e inset). After 200 h of continuous electrolysis, not only the morphology remains unchanged with embedded NiFe NPs, the crystallographic phase of the NiFe alloy is intact except for the formation of β-Ni(OH)2 (JCPDS 14-0117) on the surface of the anode catalyst (Fig. S20, ESI†). The β-Ni(OH)2 surface layer has an approximate thickness of 4 nm as analyzed by TEM imaging in Fig. S20 (ESI†). The STEM-HAADF image with the corresponding elemental mapping images of NF-8-A after the stability test confirms that the homogeneous elemental distribution remains unchanged. The bifunctional NF-8 (−) ∥ NF-8 (+) electrolyzer is also stable for at least 60 h whereas the benchmark Pt/C (−) ∥ IrO2 (+) electrolyzer shows extremely poor stability under similar conditions with the current density dropping fast from 80 to 20 mA cm−2 within 6 h (Fig. S22, ESI†).
Water splitting under harsh conditions
To evaluate the catalyst couple for commercial electrolyzers, the robustness of the NF-8 (−) ∥ NF-8 (+) electrolyzer was tested under the extreme condition of 10 M KOH, conditions often encountered in commercial alkaline electrolysis cells (Fig. 6). The OER activity of NF-8 shifts to a lower potential, reaching a current density of 10 mA cm−2 at an overpotential of 282 mV which is 32 mV lower than that in 1 M KOH, while it also retains its excellent HER activity under these conditions with an η10 value of 121 mV (Fig. 6a) indicating that even such extreme conditions are not lethal to the performance of the electrocatalyst derived from DW. The steady state polarization curve in a two electrode configuration using the bifunctional NF-8 in 10 M KOH needs a cell voltage of 1.6 V to reach 10 mA cm−2, which is 50 mV lower than that in 1 M KOH (Fig. 6b). At a constant potential of 2 V the electrolyzer shows an excellent stability for 40 h without any loss in current density (Fig. 6c), rather the activity of the electrolyzer is significantly improved (Fig. 6c inset), thus demonstrating the impressive activity and robustness of the DW electrolyzer even under harsh conditions.

Water photolysis by perovskite solar cell and DW electrolyzer
Hybrid perovskite solar cells were employed to harness solar energy directly to generate electricity necessary to split water using the couple: NF-8 (−) ∥ NF-8-A (+), as schematically shown in Fig. 7a. Two perovskite solar cells were placed side by side and connected in series to increase the open circuit voltage (VOC) higher than the minimum theoretical voltage of 1.23 V necessary to split water. The solar cells were finally connected with wires to the immersed electrodes. Fig. 7b shows the J–V characteristic of the single perovskite solar cell in the dark and under illumination of 100 mW cm−2. A single perovskite solar cell demonstrates a short-circuit photocurrent density, VOC and fill factor of 25.32 mA cm−2, 1.082 V and 0.702, respectively, yielding a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.2%. When two solar cells were connected in series, the VOC obtained is 2.048 V with a PCE of 12.23%, sufficient enough to split water using the NF-8 (−) ∥ NF-8-A (+) electrolyzer (Fig. 7c). The operating point of the solar cell integrated with the electrolyzer is determined by the intersection of the J–V curve of the solar cell and LSV curve of the electrocatalyst in a two electrode configuration. This yields an operating current density of 7.6 mA cm−2 and voltage of 1.535 V, corresponding to a staggering solar-to-hydrogen efficiency (ηSTH) of 9.7% calculated by multiplying the PCE [ηSolar-to-Electric(ηSTE): 12.23%], electrolyzer efficiency [ηElectric-to-Chemical (ηETC): 1.23/1.535 = 80%] and faradaic efficiency for hydrogen production [ηElectric-to-Hydrogen (ηETH): 99%] according to: ηSTH = ηSTE × ηETC × ηETH = 0.1223 × 0.8 × 0.99 = 9.7%(2)This ηSTH value is comparable and even better than most of the recently reported results as detailed in Table S6 (ESI†). The high efficiency is further confirmed from the unbiased light-driven configuration measurement in Fig. 7d under chopped light illumination without applying any external bias for 500 s. The generated photocurrent under chopped light illumination is slightly lower than that of the operating current which is due to the increased resistance of the combined system caused by the connecting wires along with higher contact resistance. The overall current decrease is mainly due to instability of the perovskite solar cells.41 In fact ηSTH can be further improved by improving the solar cell efficiency. Such a high ηSTH demonstrates that the DW electrolyzer can be employed for real, large-scale STH generation.

Conclusions
We demonstrated a facile and cost-effective method for the preparation of N,S-doped carbon supported NiFe NPs (NF-8 and NF-8-A) using a biomass waste (DW), by template-free one-step carbonization. The homologous electrocatalysts with uniformly embedded NPs on the carbon matrix demonstrate the high specific surface area of the mesoporous structure and enhanced electrical conductivity along with the high density of edge plane defect sites. Both NF-8 and NF-8-A electrocatalysts exhibit low overpotential and good stability for water reduction and oxidation, respectively, and their performance is comparable to those of the best reported earth abundant OER and HER catalysts. When assembled together, the NF-8 (−) ∥ NF-8-A (+) electrolyzer delivers a current density of 10 mA cm−2 at a cell voltage of 1.61 V in 1 M KOH with an excellent stability for more than 200 h. Furthermore, this electrolyzer when connected with the perovskite solar cell also exhibited efficient solar-energy-driven overall water splitting with an outstanding solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency of 9.7%. Other than addressing the disposal issue of biomass waste, our results suggest that by adapting the simple, cost-effective and scalable synthetic procedure, one can design promising earth-abundant electrocatalysts for clean and renewable energy production.
Experimental section
Materials
Nickel(II) nitrate hexahydrate extra pure (Ni(NO3)2·6H2O; Merck, ≥97%), iron(III) nitrate nonahydrate (Fe(NO3)3·9H2O; Sigma Aldrich, ≥98%), DW (obtained from one of the lakes inside the IISER Kolkata campus), potassium hydroxide pellets (KOH; Merck, ≥85%), ethanol (C2H5OH; Merck ≥99.9%), sulfuric acid (H2SO4; Merck, ≥98%), graphite powder (Alfa Aesar, 99.99%) commercial Pt/C (40 wt%, Sigma Aldrich), Toray carbon fiber paper (CFP; Alfa Aesar), Nafion perfluorinated resin solution (5 wt%, Sigma-Aldrich), and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF; Merck, ≥99%) were used without further purification.
Synthesis of NiFe alloy NPs supported on N,S-doped carbon
The DW was washed several times with water and acetone, to remove the adhered impurities, followed by complete drying under the sun and finally ground into a fine powder. The dried powder was placed inside a tube furnace and pre-carbonized at 350 °C for 2 h under an Ar atmosphere at a heating rate of 3 °C min−1 to remove water molecules from the powder, followed by washing in 1 M HCl overnight to further remove the unwanted impurities. 0.16 mmol Ni(NO3)2·6H2O and 0.16 mmol Fe(NO3)3·9H2O were added to 60 mL distilled water followed by the addition of 110 mg of pre-carbonized DW (1:1 weight ratio of metal salts to pre-carbonized DW). This mixture was sonicated for 15 min and dried at 80 °C, followed by thoroughly grounding the commixture into a homogenous fine powder. This powder was pyrolyzed at 700, 800, and 900 °C for 2 h in Ar at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1. The final products were denoted as NF-7, NF-8, and NF-9, respectively. The NF-8 sample was further annealed at 900 and 1000 °C for 1 h in Ar at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1 and the resultant samples were termed NF-8-Annealed-900 and NF-8-A, respectively. For comparison, the same method was applied to synthesize NF-8 (Ni:Fe = 1:2), NF-8 (2:1), Ni-800, and Fe-800 by varying the ratio of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O and Fe(NO3)3·9H2O. For the synthesis of only DW-700, 800, and 900, the pre-carbonized DW was pyrolyzed at 700, 800, and 900 °C, respectively, under similar conditions in the absence of metal salts. The 1:1 Ni:Fe-800 sample was synthesized via a similar procedure except for the addition of pre-carbonized DW.
Synthesis of bimetallic NiFe alloy NPs
The bimetallic 1:1 Ni:Fe alloy was synthesized by following a similar protocol adopted from the literature.42 Briefly, 1:1 Ni:Fe-800 (NiFe-oxide) was annealed in a tube furnace at 900 °C for 2 h at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1 under N2/H2 (9:1) mixture gas and allowed to cool naturally.
Synthesis of NiFe alloy NPs supported on commercial reduced graphene oxide (RGO)
Synthesis of NiFe alloy NPs supported RGO includes two steps:

(i) Synthesis of GO. 
GO was synthesized by following a modified Hummers method.43 Firstly, a mixture of 1 g graphite powder, 0.5 g NaNO3 and 25 mL conc. H2SO4 was cooled to 0 °C in an ice bath and stirred for 2 h, followed by slow addition of 3 g KMnO4 under continuous stirring for another 1 h. 30 mL distilled water was added to the above mixture at room temperature. The temperature of the mixture was raised to 90 °C in an oil bath and 100 mL of distilled water was added under continuous stirring for 1 h until the color of the solution turned mud brown. The mixture was further treated with 10 mL 30% H2O2, diluted with 2.5 L excess distilled water, filtered and dried overnight under vacuum to obtain the GO powder.


(ii) Synthesis of 1:1 NiFe-800 on RGO (RGO 1:1 NiFe-800). 
RGO 1:1 NiFe-800 was synthesized by following a general protocol adopted from the literature.44 Firstly, 20 mg GO was sonicated in 30 mL anhydrous DMF for 20 min, followed by the addition of 2 mL 0.1 M each of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O and Fe(NO3)3·9H2O aqueous solutions. The mixture was stirred for 3 h at 80 °C in an oil bath, followed by centrifugation and washing with distilled water. The obtained Ni–Fe(OH)x/GO was annealed in a tube furnace at 800 °C for 2 h under Ar and the solid product was collected after the furnace was cooled to room temperature.

Synthesis of IrO2
The protocol of IrO2 synthesis was adopted from a literature report.45 Briefly, K2IrCl6 (0.2 mmol) was added to a 50 mL aqueous solution of 0.16 g C6H5Na3O7·2H2O (0.63 mmol). The red-brown solution was adjusted to pH 7.5 using NaOH (0.25 M) solution and heated to 95 °C in an oil bath under constant stirring. After heating for 30 min, the solution was cooled to room temperature and NaOH solution was added again to adjust pH 7.5. The addition of NaOH solution at room temperature, followed by heating at 95 °C for 30 min, was repeated until the pH was stabilized at 7.5. The IrOx colloidal solution was precipitated by centrifugation and dried overnight in a desiccator. Finally, the dried powder was calcined in a box-furnace at 400 °C for 30 min to obtain the oxide.
Characterization methods
The FESEM images were obtained using a Carl Zeiss SUPRA 55VP FESEM. EDAX spectra were recorded in an Oxford Instruments X-Max with the INCA software coupled to the FESEM. TEM images were recorded with the DST-FIST facility, IISER Kolkata, with a JEOL JEM-2100F using a 200 kV electron source. A LABRAM HR800 Raman spectrometer was employed using the 633 nm line of a He–Ne ion laser as the excitation source to analyze the nanostructures. The powder XRD measurements were performed with a Rigaku (mini flex II, Japan) powder X-ray diffractometer having Cu Kα = 1.54059 Å radiation. XPS studies were carried out on the samples mounted on copper stubs with silver paste using Al Kα radiation (1486.6 eV) using a commercial photoelectron spectrometer PHI 5000 Versa Probe II, FEI Inc. The acquired data were background-corrected by the Shirley method, and the peaks were fitted using Fityk software, with Voigt peaks having 80% Gaussian and 20% Lorentzian components to find the valence states. The surface area and porosity measurements were performed with a Micromeritics Gemini VII surface area analyzer and N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms were reported by BJH (Barrett–Joyner–Halenda) surface/volume mesopore analysis. All the samples were degassed at 150 °C for 6 h. The specific surface area was determined according to the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method.
Electrical conductivity measurements
The electrical conductivity of the DW samples was measured using a two-point probe method. In order to immobilize the sample, a thin film of the catalyst ink was coated on a glass slide and silver paste on two points was used as the contact electrode. The measurement was carried out at room temperature. The corresponding conductivity (σ) was calculated according to the following equation: σ = L/RA(3)where L is the length of the film, R is the resistance film and A is the cross-sectional area of the film. The conductivity is averaged from the data of three measurements.
Electrochemical measurements
All the electrochemical measurements were carried out using an electrochemical workstation (Biologic Instruments, VSP-300) and the plots were analyzed with inbuilt software in the electrochemical workstation. The electrochemical performance for the OER and HER, and electrochemical double layer capacitance were determined in a conventional three electrode electrochemical cell and the overall water splitting test was performed in a two-electrode system in 1 M KOH, unless stated otherwise. The commercially available CFP, decorated with catalyst ink was used as the working electrode, whereas, the Pt wire and the Ag/AgCl (3 M KCl) electrode were served as the counter and reference electrodes, respectively. The catalyst ink was prepared by dispersing 5 mg catalyst in 500 μL ethanol containing 20 μL 5% Nafion and sonicated for 60 min. The catalyst ink was drop-cast onto CFP and left to dry in air with a final catalyst loading of 3 mg cm−2, followed by coating the working electrode with 20 μL 0.5% Nafion in ethanol and finally kept at 60 °C in a hot air oven overnight. For comparing the activity on 2D glassy carbon electrode, 1.5 mg of the catalyst was dispersed in 200 μL ethanol containing 10 μL 5% Nafion. The dispersion was sonicated for 60 min followed by coating the glassy carbon surface (area 0.07 cm2) with 5 μL of catalyst ink and air drying, thus finally keeping a catalyst loading of 0.5 mg cm−2. Before performing the electrochemical measurements, all the working electrodes were saturated at high oxidation and reduction potentials for few seconds followed by cyclic voltammetry (CV) scans at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. LSV polarization curves were recorded at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 in order to minimize the capacitive current,9 and this scan rate is slow enough to ensure steady-state behavior at the electrode surface.38 EIS studies were carried out in order to compare the RCT among different electrocatalysts in the faradaic region. In order to exclude the influence of pH, reference electrodes and internal solutions e.g. KCl, all the potentials reported were converted from Ag/AgCl to the RHE reference using the following equation:17 E(RHE) = E(Ag/AgCl) + E0(Ag/AgCl) + 0.059 × pH(4)
The current density was calculated by taking the working surface area from a single side. The long-term stability of the catalyst was analyzed by bulk electrolysis (chronoamperometry). To measure the faradaic efficiency, the actual amount of gas (oxygen and hydrogen) produced was measured using the water displacement method in an air-tight vessel.17,46 The ECSA was obtained from the Cdl values by collecting CVs at various scan rates (5, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 mV s−1) in a non-faradaic region (1.0 V to 1.1 V versus RHE) since the ECSA is proportional to the Cdl value in the same material according to the following equation: Cdl = Ic/ν(5)where Cdl, Ic and ν are the double layer capacitance (F cm−2) of the electroactive materials, charging current density (mA cm−2) and scan rate (mV s−1), respectively. All the potentials in three-electrode HER and OER measurements were 85% iR-corrected with respect to the ohmic resistance of the solution unless specified and calibrated to the RHE based on the equation: E(RHE) = E(Ag/AgCl) + E0(Ag/AgCl) + 0.059 × pH − 85% iRs(6)
Perovskite solar cell fabrication
Mixed halide perovskite (CH3NH3PbI3−xClx) absorber based solar cells were fabricated on pre-patterned fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glass substrates. Before the device fabrication, FTO coated glass substrates were cleaned in a soap solution, distilled water, ethanol and isopropanol under sonication for 10 min each. Then the substrates were dried at 80 °C and cured with an ultraviolet ozone cleaner for 10 min. A compact TiO2 layer was deposited on the FTO glass by spin coating at 2000 rpm for 30 s. Thereafter, the substrates were kept on a 100 °C pre-heated hot plate for 10 min and sequentially annealed at 550 °C for 1 h in a box furnace. After cooling to room temperature, the mesoporous TiO2 layer was spin-coated on top of the compact TiO2 layer at 2000 rpm for 30 s and annealed at 550 °C for 1 h. The substrate with mesoporous TiO2 (mp-TiO2) layer was transferred into a N2 filled glove box for the deposition of the perovskite and hole transport layer. Nanocrystal embedded perovskite precursor solution (0.75 mM of lead iodide, methylammonium iodide and methylammonium chloride in DMF) was deposited onto the mp-TiO2 layer by spin coating at 4000 rpm for 30 s with an initial ramp of 450 rpm for 5 s. Thereafter, the perovskite films were annealed at 80 °C for 90 min. Thereafter, a 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-pmethoxyphenylamine)-9,9-spirobifluorene (Spiro-MeOTAD) hole transport layer was deposited on top of the perovskite layer via spin coating of a solution containing 72.3 mg mL−1 spiro-OMeTAD in chlorobenzene, 28.8 μL of 4-tert-butyl pyridine (4-TBP), and 17.5 μL of lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) solution (520 mg mL−1 in acetonitrile) at 2000 rpm for 30 s, followed by annealing at 80 °C on a pre-heated hot plate for 10 min. Then, the substrates were transferred to the thermal evaporator for sequential deposition of MoO3 and the Au top electrode. Firstly, a 9 nm MoO3 layer was deposited at a deposition rate of 0.1–0.3 Å s−1 and finally a 100 nm Au thin film was deposited using a shadow mask at a deposition rate of 0.3–1 Å s−1 and a base pressure of 5.5 × 10−6 Torr. The thickness of deposited MoO3 and Au films were estimated in situ via a quartz crystal thickness monitor.
Integration of perovskite solar cells with the DW electrolyzer
The solar cell sub-module was fabricated by connecting two identical devices in series. For photovoltaic driven water splitting, this sub-module was integrated with a water splitting system. The cathode of one solar cell was directly connected to the anode of the second solar cell via a wire in series connection. Another copper wire was connected to the cathode of the second solar cell and finally connected to the anode of the DW electrolyzer containing the OER electrocatalyst. The counter electrode port of the potentiostat connected with the reference port (for a two electrode configuration) was then connected to the cathode of the DW electrolyzer containing the HER electrocatalyst. Finally, the working electrode port of the potentiostat was connected to the anode of the first solar cell to complete the circuit. The current of the water splitting cell was recorded by chronoamperometry for different time intervals under AM 1.5G illumination without applying any external bias.
Solar cell characterization
The current–voltage characteristics of single perovskite solar cells with an active area of 0.04 cm2 were recorded using a Biologic Instrument, model no. VSP-300 with a scan rate of 270 mV s−1 in the forward scan direction. A class AAA solar simulator (Batsol, PEC-L01) was used for illumination of the devices under AM 1.5G and 100 mW cm−2 illumination conditions with spectral mismatch <3%. The illumination conditions were calibrated using an NREL standard Si solar cell.
