    , Accepted 29th April 2020First published on 29th April 2020AbstractTernary I–III–VI2 semiconductors usually have narrow band gaps and large absorption coefficients arising from the unique characteristics of their outer-d valence electrons, which are intimately connected with the photothermal conversion properties. AgFeS2 is known as one such material that has the potential to absorb near-infrared light. In this work, we utilized density functional theory (DFT) calculations to evaluate the electronic structure and optical absorption properties of AgFeS2. Strong absorptions were predicted over a wide Vis-NIR region due to the localized 3d electron of Fe atoms, which agree quite well with the UV-Vis-NIR spectra measured by experiment. The as-prepared AgFeS2 nanoparticles were then modified with mPEG-DSPE, an efficient photothermal agent for artery stenosis therapy. Its photothermal conversion effect has been systematically studied, indicating the potential for causing the hyperthermia of macrophages, an essential part of the artery inflammation response. More importantly, both in vitro cell experiments and in vivo mouse-model studies show that the induction of hyperthermia in artery stenosis by using AgFeS2 nanoparticles is safe and effective when injected at a very low concentration. This study provides a novel photothermal platform derived from the inheritability of bandgap structure and also promotes the process of artery inflammation and stenosis therapy.
1 Introduction
Atherosclerosis (AS) is a chronic disease that is one of the main causes of death.1 Photothermal therapy (PTT) based on nanoparticles shows promising potential due to its less invasive characteristics that can kill macrophages, the key cells that are responsible for AS formation, as compared to the traditional whole-body chemotherapy and stent implant surgery that has in-stent restenosis risks.2,3 Nanoparticles mostly aggregate in lysosomes in macrophages as they have much larger amounts of lysosomes than endothelial cells.3 Ternary I–III–VI2 semiconductors have been considered as one of the most promising materials for optoelectronic products due to their high conversion efficiency, low toxicity, and large absorption coefficients.4 The absorption can be further maximized due to optical resonance when the size of these bulk materials is reduced to the nanoscale.5 Because of their specific inherent properties, the I–III–VI2 semiconductors have been receiving increasing attention as multifunctional materials in optoelectronic devices, environmental research and vital medical research.6–8 A typical representative is copper-based ternary materials.7,8 For example, in disease treatment areas such as cancer research, copper bismuth sulfide and chalcopyrite (CuFeS2) have been reported as excellent multifunctional cancer detection probes and therapy agents.9,10 Not only do they inherit properties from their parents (copper chalcogenides, which are efficient photothermal nanomaterials for cancer therapy),11–13 but the doped elements may also help to increase their absorption or provide these nanostructures with the potential for the diagnosis and treatment of diseases.14 All of these characteristics indicate that ternary I–III–VI2 semiconductors can be used in the medical research area.
It has been widely accepted that the photothermal conversion properties of nanomaterials are closely related to their optical absorption characteristics.15 Broadband absorption is usually the first consideration when designing multi-functional photothermal nanoagents; for instance, magnetic-based photothermal nanoagents with narrow band gaps from which these materials can absorb a wide range of light have attracted the interest of researchers.14,16–18 These materials are also widely studied as “all-for-one” nanomaterials that combine photothermal therapy (PTT), chemodynamic therapy (CDT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of cancer cells, and can be made under relatively harmonious environments.8 This is because the bandgaps and absorptions of ternary materials are more controllable by varying the ratios of the components or template morphology.19,20
Considering these properties mentioned above, lenaite AgFeS2, a ternary I–III–VI2 semiconductor with a bandgap of ∼0.88–1.2 eV has attracted our interest as a potential absorbing material for solar cells.21,22 This material has been rarely studied in this area because silver is a kind of noble metal and the synthesis methods of AgFeS2 are a little complicated.21 Despite the cost, silver has a long history of being used in medical treatment.23,24 Ag materials have been well-applied in anti-bacterials for a very long period,25 and we recently reported that Janus Ag/Ag2S beads synthesized via a novel method have great potential for the treatment of vascular inflammation.26 Moreover, Ag2S quantum dots have been illustrated as a promising fluorescent probe with both bright photoluminescence and high biocompatibility, however, little information about their photothermal ability has been reported.27 Another component, iron, is one of the most abundant trace elements in human bodies.18 Materials based on Fe are usually considered safe and biocompatible. Furthermore, considering the efficient role of the Fe 3d electrons in the absorption of near-infrared light,17,28,29 Fe-based materials have been researched as promising photothermal nanoagents for cancer therapy, combined with other properties like the Fenton effect and magnetic resonance imaging.16,17 Therefore, it is possible that the ternary semiconductor AgFeS2 could inherit many prominent and important features that are helpful for disease treatment and these materials are well worth studying.
In this work, we have investigated AgFeS2 nanoparticles as an effective photothermal material for effective artery stenosis therapy. We first utilized DFT calculations to evaluate the electronic structure and optical absorption properties of AgFeS2. Strong absorption was predicted over a wide band region over the Vis-NIR region due to the localized Fe 3d electrons. Surprisingly, the results agree quite well with the measured UV-Vis-NIR spectrum. Photothermal ability was systematically studied as it is very important to prove that this material has relatively high photothermal conversion efficiency for further bioresearch. The potential utilization of AgFeS2 nanoparticles for the photothermal treatment of macrophages was investigated in vitro through TEM, fluorescent staining and CCK-8 analysis, which illustrated that AgFeS2 has good biocompatibility and low biotoxicity. More importantly, the in vivo photothermal therapy for artery stenosis was proved to be effective and safe by using a low concentration of AgFeS2 nanoparticles, as confirmed by mice models without apolipoprotein E (Apo-E). Due to the existence of magnetic elements and the structure, this material may also have the potential for detection and imaging in the biomedical area. This is the first time that AgFeS2 has been proved to be a promising photothermal nanoagent for the effective treatment of artery inflammation and stenosis.
2 Experimental section
2.1 Materials and reagents
Silver nitrate (AgNO3, 99%), cyclohexane (AR) and iron(III) nitrate nonahydrate (Fe(NO3)3·9H2O, 99%) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd (Shanghai, China). Sodium diethyldithiocarbamate trihydrate (Na(S2CNEt2)·3H2O, 99%) was obtained from Shanghai Macklin Biochemical Co. Ltd (Shanghai, China). Oleylamine (OLA, 80–90%) was obtained from Aladdin Industrial Corporation (Shanghai, China). Trichloromethane (CHCl3, 99%) was purchased from Shanghai Lingfeng Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd (Shanghai, China). 1,2-Diacyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-[methoxy(polyethylene glycol)] (mPEG-DSPE, Mw 5000) was obtained from Laysan Bio, Inc. (USA). All of the chemical agents were directly used without any further purification.
2.2 Synthesis of Fe(S2CNEt2)3 precursors
For the synthesis of precursor Fe(S2CNEt2)3, Na(S2CNEt2)·3H2O (3.50 g) was firstly dissolved in deionized water (100 mL), then another 40 mL of deionized water containing Fe(NO3)·9H2O (2.02 g) was slowly added into the above solution with vigorous stirring. After stirring for 2 h, the resulting dark brown precipitate was filtered, washed several times with deionized water, and then dried under a vacuum at 60 °C before use.
2.3 Synthesis of AgFeS2 nanoparticles
AgFeS2 nanoparticles were synthesized as adapted from a previously published protocol.22 Briefly, Fe(S2CNEt2)3 (0.10 g) and 20 mL OLA were added in a 50 mL beaker and dispersed well by ultrasonication. The mixture was transferred into a three-necked flask and 0.068 g of AgNO3 was added under magnetic stirring. It was then degassed by heating to 60 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere for 20 min. The temperature was raised to 150 °C and maintained for 30 min, then naturally cooled to room temperature. The black product was gathered by centrifugation (8000 r, 5 min) and washed several times with CHCl3 and ethanol. Finally, it was dried in a vacuum at 60 °C for further characterization.
2.4 Modification of AgFeS2 with mPEG-DSPE (AgFeS2@mPEG-DSPE)
In an empirical procedure,30 10 mg of dry AFS NPs and 10 mg mPEG-DSPE were added to a round-bottom flask containing 10 ml of CHCl3. The mixture was ultrasonicated for 20 min and then stirred for up to 3 h to form a well-distributed solution. It was then dried in a rotary vacuum evaporator, washed and dispersed in phosphate buffer solution (PBS) for further use.
2.5 Characterizations
X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed using a D/max-2550 PC X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku). Transmission electron microscopy images (TEM) were acquired by a transmission electron microscope (JEM-2100F). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were measured on an ESCALab250. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were recorded using KBr-pressed pellets on a Nicolet 6700 spectrometer (USA). Ultraviolet–visible-near-infrared (UV-VIS-NIR) absorption spectra were obtained on a UV-1902PC spectrophotometer (Phoenix). The iron content in the solutions was determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) on a high-dispersion Leeman Labs Prodigy instrument. The bandgaps of synthesized AFS NPs were determined by a Lambda 35, PerkinElmer.
2.6 Theoretical calculations
The first principles spin-polarized calculations were performed based on the density functional theory (DFT) as implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation (VASP) package.31 The PBE functional was used to optimize the atomic structures and calculate electronic structures.32 Projector augmented wave (PAW) potentials were used to describe the core–valence interaction, and plane waves up to the kinetic energy of 350 eV were used as the basis set.33 A conventional orthorhombic cell, consisting of 4 Ag, 4 Fe and 8 S atoms, was used in the calculation as shown in Fig. 1(a). The Gamma-centered Monkhorst–Pack k-point mesh of 8 × 8 × 4 and 11 × 11 × 7 were used to sample the Brillouin zone of the supercell during the optimization of the structure and calculation of the charge density, respectively. The atomic structures were relaxed until the residual forces on all atoms were smaller than 0.01 eV.

2.7 Photothermal effect of AgFeS2@mPEG-DSPE in aqueous dispersions
To measure the photothermal effect, 100 μl of AgFeS2@mPEG-DSPE aqueous dispersions with various concentrations (0, 5, 10, 20, 40, 80 ppm) were irradiated at a power density of 0.7 W cm−2 by an 808 nm NIR laser (Shanghai Xilong Optoelectronic Technology Co. Ltd., China) for 5 min. The working distance and the spot area were 20 cm and 0.3844 cm2, respectively. At the same time, the instant temperature was recorded and imaged by a FLIR A300 camera (USA).
2.8 Photothermal performance of AgFeS2@mPEG-DSPE
The extinction coefficient ε(λ) was determined according to the Lambert–Beer Law: A(λ) = εLC(1)where A is the absorbance at wavelength λ; in this article, it is 808 nm. L is 1 cm, and C is the concentration of AgFeS2 nanoparticles.
As can be seen from previous reports,34,35 the photothermal conversion efficiency was defined as ηT, which was calculated from the following equation: (2)where I is the laser power, calculated as ∼269 mW. Aλ is the absorbance of the sample at 808 nm obtained from the UV-Vis-NIR spectrum. Q1 and Q0 are the heat inputs of the solvent with and without sample, respectively; they can be calculated using eqn (3): Q = hA (Tmax − Tamb)(3)where Tmax is the maximum temperature of the sample or the pure deionized water. The highest temperature of the sample (40 ppm) was 46.4 °C and that of water was 24.3 °C; Tamb is the environmental temperature (22.3 °C) which was independently measured to be 4.99 mW. h is the heat transfer coefficient of the sample system, and A is the surface area of the container. hA can be calculated using the following equation: (4)where mD is the mass (∼0.1 g), and cD is the heat capacity of deionized water (4.2 J (g °C)−1) applied as the solvent. τs is the time constant, obtained from the –ln(θ)–time diagram. θ was defined as (T − Tamb)/(Tmax − Tamb), where T is the instant temperature.
2.9 Cellular experiments
To evaluate the photothermal effects and cytotoxicity of AgFeS2@mPEG-DSPE on macrophages, TEM imaging, CCK-8 assay and Calcein AM/PI staining were performed. For the TEM assay, the macrophage cell line RAW 264.7 was cultured in RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal bovine serum, following the recommendations. RAW 264.7 cells were incubated with AgFeS2@mPEG-DSPE (40 ppm) for 12 h, washed with phosphate-buffered saline solution (PBS) and then irradiated under an 808 NIR laser (or not). After dehydration and counterstaining, the cells were imaged by TEM to detect the phagocytosis of the sample. For in vitro cell viability assay, AgFeS2@mPEG-DSPE, with a series of concentrations (0, 10, 20, 40, 80, 120 and 160 ppm), was used to treat RAW 264.7 cells seeded in 96-well plates for 12 h, followed by washing 3–4 times with PBS. Subsequently, the cell viabilities were detected by CCK-8 (Dojindo Laboratories, Shanghai, China). According to the instructions from the manufacturer, 10 μL of CCK-8 agent was added to 100 μL of PBS. For the in vitro photothermal ability test, cells were cultured with 40 ppm of AgFeS2@mPEG-DSPE for 12 h. After washing with PBS, the cells were subjected to an 808 nm irradiation for 5 min with various power densities of 0, 0.56, 1.12 and 1.32 W cm−2, respectively. Cells cultured without materials serve as the control. Cell apoptosis was analyzed by Calcein AM/PI staining (Calcein AM/PI was bought from Dojindo Laboratories, Shanghai, China) and imaged under an immunofluorescence microscope (Olympus, Japan).
2.10 Animal experiments
The 8-week-old male Apo-E mice were purchased from the Shanghai Research Center for Model Organisms. All experiments were performed under protocols approved by the Animal Experiment and Care Committee, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine. All animal procedures were performed following the Institutional Animal Care guidelines of Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, affiliated with the Shanghai Jiao Tong University, and ethically approved by their Ethics Committee. Pentobarbital sodium (40 mg kg−1) was used to anesthetize the mice and then their carotid arteries on one side were exposed and placed with constrictive silica collars to introduce atherosclerotic-like restenosis.36 The collars had an average external diameter of 0.38 mm, an internal diameter of 0.2 mm and a length of 5 mm. The carotid arteries were sham-operated to act as a control group. Photothermal therapy (PTT) experiments were performed after 2 weeks.
2.11 Photothermal therapy and histological analysis
PBS with AgFeS2@mPEG-DSPE (80 ppm) (or without) was injected into mice (n = 3), then at 12 h after injection, all stenosis areas were irradiated perpendicularly by an 808 nm NIR laser with a power density of 0.7 W cm−2 for 5 min. A GX-300 photothermal medical device with an infrared camera (Shanghai Infratest Electronics Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China) was used to monitor the real-time temperature change. All mice were sacrificed for histological analysis at 2 weeks after PTT. All carotid arteries, including the experimental and control groups, were collected and fixed with paraformaldehyde (PFA) to make paraffin sections for further staining by hematoxylin/eosin (HE). Images were recorded using a light microscope ((Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) and analyzed by Image-Pro Plus (IPP). At the same time, the frozen sections were also evaluated by immunofluorescence. α-SMA (from Abcam), 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (from DAKO) and MAC-387 (from Abcam) were used for staining smooth muscle cells (SMCs), nuclei, and macrophages, respectively.
2.12 Long-term toxicity analysis
For long-term toxicity analysis, PBS solution with or without AgFeS2@mPEG-DSPE was intravenously injected (12 mg kg−1) in healthy Apo-E mice (n = 3). The mice were sacrificed to collect blood samples for blood biochemistry and complete blood panel analysis after intervals of 7, 15 and 30 days, respectively. After different periods of 1, 3, 9, 15, and 30 days, these mice were sacrificed to extract major organs in terms of hearts, livers, spleens, lungs, and kidneys for histological analysis (n = 3 at each time point).
3 Results and discussion
3.1 Prediction of the electronic structure and optical properties of AgFeS2
To evaluate the optical absorption and thus the photothermal properties of AgFeS2, we performed the DFT calculations first. Considering that the semi-local functional always underestimates the band gap of semiconductors, especially for those with d orbitals, we used the DFT+U method in all the calculations with U = 3 eV applied on the 3d orbital of Fe atoms.31–33 The optimized structure of AgFeS2 is shown in Fig. 1a, where S atoms tetrahedrally bond with both Ag and Fe atoms. The ground state of AgFeS2 was found to be an antiferromagnetic configuration. The magnetic moment per Fe ion was 3.64μB and is opposite in sign for the ions in the neighboring layers along the c axis. As shown in Fig. 1b, AgFeS2 exhibits an indirect bandgap of 0.99 eV, and the valence band maximum (VBM) and conduction band maximum (CBM) lie at the M and Γ point, respectively. A direct gap of 1.08 eV appears at the M point, which is close to those (0.88–1.2 eV) determined by the previous experiment,21,22 justifying the validity of the calculation parameters. It is notable in Fig. 1b that several narrow bands lie above the Fermi level with bandwidth less than 1 eV, which resulted from the localized d orbitals of Fe atoms as shown in Fig. 1c. These narrow bands should lead to the strong absorption of AgFeS2 ranging from the near-infrared to visible light. This was confirmed by the calculated absorption spectrum (Fig. 1d). The predicted strong optical absorption over a broad band suggests that AgFeS2 is a promising candidate for photothermal materials.
3.2 Characterization and photothermal ability of AgFeS2 nanoparticles
For verifying the simulation, hydrophobic AgFeS2 nanoparticles were readily synthesized by AgNO3 and Fe(S2CNEt2)3 in oleylamine through a thermal decomposition route under N2 atmosphere. The experiment was carried out at 150 °C for 30 min as outlined in Scheme 1; see the Experimental section for details. The AgFeS2@mPEG-DSPE can be swallowed by macrophages, which can then be ablated by the hyperthermia effect from laser irradiation. To evaluate the existence of mPEG-DSPE, the FTRI spectra were recorded (Fig. S1a†), which confirmed the successful coating of mPEG-DSPE on the surface of AgFeS2 nanoparticles. The digital photos (Fig. S1b†) provide further proof.

To confirm the crystallographic structure of AgFeS2 nanoparticles, the XRD spectrum (Fig. 2a) was measured, which showed that it could be indexed to the lenaite AgFeS2 phase (PDF#48-1895). These as-synthesized nanoparticles had an average diameter of 9.7 ± 2.6 nm, as demonstrated by the TEM image (an overall review of RAWAn overall review of RAWAn overall review of RAWAn overall review of RAWure. 2b). The high-resolution TEM image (Fig. 2b inset) shows a well-defined crystalline lattice of AgFeS2 nanoparticles with an interplanar spacing of about 0.1998 nm corresponding to the (220) lattice. In order to obtain further information on the composition and chemical valence state of AgFeS2, XPS was performed. The XPS survey image (Fig. 2c) indicated that the sample compositions mainly included Ag, Fe, and S. Fig. 2e shows that the double peaks at 373.8 eV and 367.8 eV were derived from Ag+, which correspond to Ag 3d3/2, Ag 3d5/2.15,37 Moreover, peaks at 724.5 eV (Fe 2p1/2) and 711.1 eV (Fe 2p3/2), as well as shakeup satellites, were attributed to Fe3+ and Fe 2p3/2, respectively (Fig. 2f).38,39 The S 2p spectrum (Fig. 2d) splits into two main S 2p1/2 and S 2p3/2 doublets which were observed at 162.3 eV and 161.1 eV due to metal sulfides, and at 164.4 eV and 163.2 eV due to disulfides.40

The measured bandgap was around 1.1 eV (Fig. S2a†) which was close to the calculated result. The absorption spectrum also agrees quite well with the prediction of the DFT calculation since a broad peak near 500 nm appears in both spectra (Fig. 3a). The good agreement suggests that the measured good absorption ability originates from the intrinsic inter-band transition of AgFeS2 other than the plasma effect. Although the absorption shows a small decrease after modification, it is still good enough in terms of NIR absorption (Fig. S2b†). The extinction coefficient was as high as 28.3 L g−1 cm−1, as shown in the figure (Fig. S2c†), which is higher than that of the Janus Ag/Ag2S we synthesized before.26 In order to test its photothermal ability, we systematically studied the photothermal effect of this material using an 808 nm near-infrared laser. The concentration of Fe3+ was determined by ICP-AES. According to the figures (Fig. S3a and c†), when the concentrations of the material remained the same, the temperature change increased linearly with the increase in laser power, around 2.16 °C per 0.1 W cm−2. However, on fixing the laser power, it was almost in proportion to the concentration at low concentration (Fig. S3b and d†), which was introduced by the fraction of incident radiation that was absorbed.35 The IR images (S4) more directly show the difference between the final temperatures. From the cycling test (Fig. 3b), we can see the good stability of this material. Furthermore, it has great photothermal conversion ability. When irradiated by an 808 nm laser with a power density of 0.7 W cm−2, the temperature of an aqueous dispersion with 40 ppm of AgFeS2@mPEG-DSPE rose to more than 45 °C (Fig. 3c). The photothermal efficiency was calculated through the cooling curve (Fig. 3d), which reached as high as 43% according to the method reported by Roper.35 These experimental results supported that AgFeS2 can be an efficient photothermal agent.

3.3 Intracellular experiment of AgFeS2 nanoparticles on macrophages
To evaluate the ability of the AgFeS2 nanoparticles to cause hyperthermia of macrophages, which play a primordial role in the formation of artery inflammation and atherosclerosis,2,41 the phagocytosis of macrophages on AgFeS2@mPEG-DSPE was determined by transmission electron microscopy. Fig. 4a and b show that macrophages can engulf materials effectively with no obvious damage to the cells. Then, after irradiating cells cultured with AgFeS2@mPEG-DSPE using an 808 nm laser at a power density of 0.7 W cm−2 for 5 min, the membrane of the macrophages was destroyed (Fig. 4c), indicating its efficiency to kill cells through hyperthermia. Furthermore, as the CCK-8 assay shows (Fig. 4d), cell visibility did not decline significantly until the concentration of AgFeS2@mPEG-DSPE increased to 120 ppm.
 Fig. 4  (a) An overall review of RAW 264.7 cells incubated with the PBS solution of AgFeS2@mPEG-DSPE (40 ppm). (b) High-resolution representative TEM image of AgFeS2@mPEG-DSPE swallowed by cells. (c) Representative TEM image of RAW 264.7 cells incubated with the PBS solution of AgFeS2@mPEG-DSPE after laser irradiation. (d) The relative viabilities of RAW 264.7 cells after incubation with the AgFeS2@mPEG-DSPE’ PBS solution at different concentrations (0, 10, 20, 40, 80, 120, 160 ppm). 
According to previous studies, the photothermal process can cause an inflammation response but there are also reports indicating that the laser irradiation can inhibit excessive inflammation, facilitate angiogenesis, as well as improve revascularization.42,43 As for the material itself, Ag-based Janus Ag/Ag2S nanoparticles have been proven to have little inflammation response.26 Anti-CD68 receptor-targeted Fe-doped hollow silica nanoparticles were used as a dual-modal US/MRI contrast agent for identifying macrophages of aorta ventralis atherosclerotic plaques in Apo-E mice.44 This evidence, as well as our experiment on cell viabilities, demonstrated that this system is effective and safe at the tested parameters, which also indicates that it is worthy of further exploration. In order to further evaluate the photothermal ablation ability of the macrophages using AgFeS2@mPEG-DSPE, RAW 264.7 cells incubated under its solution at a concentration of 40 ppm were used for further investigation. After incubation for 12 h and carefully washing with PBS, the cells were then exposed vertically to an 808 nm laser with various power densities of 0, 0.56, 1.12 and 1.32 W cm−2 for 5 min. Cells incubated without AgFeS2@mPEG-DSPE served as the control. Subsequently, RAW 264.7 cells underwent Calcein AM/PI staining for living/dead cells and were then imaged under a fluorescence microscope. The fluorescence pictures (Fig. 5) illustrate that the material itself does little harm to RAW 264.7 cells. As expected, the red part was enlarged with the increase in the power density of the laser, and when it rose to 1.12 W cm−2, almost all macrophages died due to the photothermal effect. Based on these intracellular experimental results, the capability of this material for in vivo use is worthy of further investigation.

          In vivo experiment and histological analysis
As previously reported,2 macrophages can load lipids and if they cannot be efficiently cleared by efferocytosis, the accumulation of macrophages will introduce artery stenosis. To test the ability of AgFeS2@mPEG-DSPE to treat this disease, as well as the in vivo biotoxicity, we built an artery inflammation model in 8-week-old Apo-E mice. After 2 weeks, the mice underwent photothermal therapy. Fig. S5† shows the IR images of mice injected with AgFeS2@mPEG-DSPE’ PBS solution or PBS; the temperature increased quickly and was close to 50 °C in the experimental group. On the contrary, it only showed a slight fluctuation in the control group, less than 2 °C.
After another 2 weeks, the collared arteries were extracted and used for double staining (Fig. 6). The HE histological analysis (Fig. 6aI, aII, bI, bII) showed significant differences in the thickness of the walls of vessels. It is obvious that macrophages have a wider distribution in the PBS-treated artery as compared to the experimental artery, according to the immunofluorescence staining pictures (Fig. 6aIII, aIV, aV, aVI, bIII, bIV, bV, bVI). Statistical analysis of the thicknesses of their walls was also performed and is shown in Fig. S6.† The value of the experimental group is around half that of the control group.

(III, IV, V & VI) Immunofluorescence staining of artery stenosis, with (a) PBS as the control, (b) the @mPEG-DSPE’ PBS dispersion after irradiation by an 808 nm laser. Green, blue and red represent the SMCs, nuclei and macrophages, respectively. Scale bars in I, III, IV, V & VI: 800 μm. Scale bars in II: 400 μm. 
Since in vivo biosafety of nanomedicines is always of great concern for application in artery therapy, further bio-safety experiments, the blood indexes (Fig. 7a) of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine (CR) were obtained from blood biochemistry and complete blood panel analysis, in which no abnormal changes were observed. In addition, from the HE staining of the major organs, including the heart, kidney, spleen, liver, and lung, no inflammation or damage was observed (Fig. 7b). This further confirmed that the AgFeS2@mPEG-DSPE has promising potential for causing hyperthermia in artery stenosis with great biosafety. However, deep systematic studies of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics are still quite important for future clinical applications of such materials. This kind of material may also have another specific potential, such as magnetic resonance imaging, that can further transform the platform for multiple uses to promote its clinical translation

4 Conclusion
In conclusion, based on theoretical calculations, a novel photoresponsive hyperthermia platform of AgFeS2 nanoparticles modified with mPEG-DSPE was developed for artery stenosis therapy. The UV-Vis-NIR spectra obtained were in good accordance with the calculated results, which further proved the great optic properties of this material. It was calculated to initiate a relatively high photothermal conversion efficiency of 43%, as well as an extinction coefficient of 28.3 L g−1 cm−1. Moreover, these nanoparticles show excellent hyperthermia performance and biocompatibility, as well as low bio-toxicity not only in the cell experiments but also in the mice model studies. Overall, we believe that AgFeS2@mPEG-DSPE is promising for photothermal therapy of artery stenosis, which can promote the translation of this kind of nano-medicine for clinical application.
