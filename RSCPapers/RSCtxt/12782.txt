    First published on 12th September 2018AbstractNowadays, the increasing requirements of portable, implantable, and wearable electronics have greatly stimulated the development of miniaturized energy storage devices (MESDs). Electrochemically active materials and microfabrication techniques are two indispensable parts in MESDs. Particularly, the architecture design of microelectrode arrays is beneficial to the accessibility of two-dimensional (2D) active materials. Therefore, this study reviews the recent advancements in microbatteries and microsupercapacitors based on electrochemically active 2D materials. Emerging microfabrication strategies enable the precise control over the thickness, homogeneity, structure, and dimension in miniaturized devices, which offer tremendous opportunities for achieving both high energy and power densities. Furthermore, smart functions and integrated systems are discussed in detail in light of the emergence of intelligent and interactive modes. Finally, future developments, opportunities, and urgent challenges related to 2D materials, device fabrications, smart responsive designs, and microdevice integrations are provided.

1. Introduction
Energy production using scarce fossil fuels such as coal, petroleum, and natural gas is causing severe economic and environmental issues worldwide. There is an urgent need to exploit renewable resources such as solar, wind, tidal, and geothermal energy. However, owing to the intermittency of these natural resources, energy storage systems play an important role in storing the electricity generated from them.1–4 Among diverse storage media, electrochemical energy storage devices, comprising rechargeable batteries (RBs) and supercapacitors (SCs), are widely used in portable electronics (e.g., mobile devices, multimedia players, and personal medical devices), medium transportation systems (e.g., electrical vehicles and aerospace), and large-scale energy storage systems (e.g., electric grids).5–9
RBs and SCs are similar in that they have a positive electrode, a negative electrode, a separator, and an electrolyte.10,11 However, they have different charge-storage mechanisms. As shown in Fig. 1a, SCs are usually classified as electric double-layer capacitors (EDLCs) and pseudocapacitors.12–20 In EDLCs, electrostatic charge accumulates at the electrode/electrolyte interface through ion adsorption to form electric double layers. In pseudocapacitors, charge is stored using reversible surface/near-surface Faradic reactions. In general, SCs provide fast charge/discharge capability (high power density) because of surface-mediated ion diffusion. RBs rely on reversible redox reactions on the surfaces and in the bulk form of active materials for charge storage (Fig. 1b). As a result, RBs have much higher energy densities, but they suffer from insufficient power density ascribed to the slow ion diffusion kinetics in solid electrode materials.21–23 High-efficiency energy storage applications require these devices to be compact and to yet store and release large amounts of electrical energy rapidly. Doing so would be impossible without selecting appropriate electrode materials and designing suitable device configurations.

Schematics of MESDs with different configurations based on electrochemically active 2D materials: (d) fiber shape, (e) in-plane architecture, and (f) 3D type. 
In recent years, the development of portable, implantable, and wearable electronics has focused on the miniaturization, low weight, safe, long-term, and high-speed operation, thus further stimulating the demand for miniaturized energy storage devices (MESDs).24–26 MESDs, short for the miniaturization of conventional energy storage devices, are able to store and deliver electrical energy in the form of chemical energy over a certain period of use for microelectronics. Their total areal size can be in the millimeter or even the centimeter scale with a distance between two adjacent electrodes down to the micron scale. Undoubtedly, to collect, receive, and transmit signals, these microelectronics must be connected with power sources. Furthermore, practical needs have resulted in an increasing demand for self-powered integrated systems that can operate sustainably and independently without maintenance. Energy can be extracted and converted into electricity by energy harvesters based on piezoelectric, triboelectric, thermoelectric, and photovoltaic effects. In this regard, MESDs are highly desirable to compensate for their intermittency and ensure long-term energy supply. Thus, MESDs such as microsupercapacitors (MSCs)27–30 and microbatteries (MBs)31–34 can be integrated with energy harvesting microsystems, achieving high peak power, long lifetime, and high rate capability while retaining reasonable energy density for practical applications in microsized integrated systems.35Fig. 1c shows a year-wise graph of publications reflecting the increasing research interests in MESDs. In addition, advanced microelectronics techniques provide a solid foundation for fabricating MESDs. Thus far, three main kinds of device configurations for MESDs have been established: fiber shape (Fig. 1d), in-plane architecture (Fig. 1e), and three-dimensional (3D) type (Fig. 1f).
To satisfy the ever-growing demands for electricity storage in both stationary and mobile electronic devices, advanced electrode materials must be developed for MESDs with both high energy and power densities. Two-dimensional (2D) materials represent an emerging class of materials with strong in-plane chemical bonding, but weak out-of-plane van der Waals interactions.36 Such unique structure allows the manipulation of the interlayer space through efficient and effective nanoscale engineering. Since the discovery of monolayer graphene exfoliated from graphite in 2004,37 2D materials have undergone rapid development for applications of their unusual electronic, mechanical, chemical, electrochemical and optical properties. Like graphene, many 2D materials exhibit large planar topology (>100 nm) and ultralow thickness (single- or few-atom thickness). Extensive studies have been conducted on 2D materials with diversified applications, including electronics, superconductors, sensing, catalysis, energy storage and energy conversion, etc.38–42 Particularly, atomic-scale ultrathin layered structures of electrochemically active 2D materials are attractive for MESDs. As shown in Fig. 1d–f, the exposed surface area of 2D materials opens 2D channels for fast ion transport and shortens the charge transport path. Furthermore, the distance between microelectrodes downs to micron level, effectively shortening the diffusion paths of ions in electrolyte and microelectrodes. Typical 2D materials for MESDs include transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), transition metal oxides (TMOs)/hydroxides (TMHs), transition metal carbides/nitrides (mainly MXene materials), and 2D metal–organic frameworks and covalent-organic frameworks (MOFs and COFs). Thus far, considerable attentions have been focused on engineering these 2D materials structurally to enhance their electrochemical performances.43–45
Several recent reviews on MESDs have mostly focused on issues such as electrode materials, fabrication methods, or device design for certain device types such as fiber-shape MSCs,46,47 in-plane MSCs,48 and 3D MBs.8,49 However, no systematic summary has been provided for recent progress in the development of next-generation miniaturized MESDs for smart integrated systems based on 2D materials, including emerging fabrication technologies, introduction of smart functions, and device innovations for system integrations. Toward this end, the current review article aims at a comprehensive description of the latest scientific progresses towards MESDs using 2D materials from individual devices to smart integrated systems (Fig. 2). First, we describe the recent development of MESDs, including MSCs and MBs, according to the representative 2D materials and prominent fabrication techniques. This section addresses the relationship between fabrication strategies and corresponding electrochemical properties. Afterwards, we discuss novel strategies to introduce stimulus–response functions into MESDs, with a particular focus on their design principles and special functional properties. We further demonstrate the state-of-the-art research in the area of integrated systems, especially the integration of MESDs with solar cells, nanogenerators, photodetectors, and gas sensors. Finally, we outline the future developments, prospects, and key technological challenges based on the considerations of performance improvement, smart responsive design, and microdevice integration using 2D materials.

2. MESDs
MESDs offer robust power delivery, making them useful in wireless sensor networks for home automation, transport surveillance, health control, environmental monitoring, and industrial process tracking. Micropower systems can be fabricated with micrometer-scale lengths and improved performance compared to conventional sandwich-structured energy storage devices that is attributable to short ion/electron diffusion lengths. Moreover, miniaturized devices accelerate both ion and electron transports within electrochemically active 2D materials and reduce the resistance across the positive electrode, negative electrode, and electrolyte.50 This section particularly discusses the MESDs employing various microfabrication methodologies based on suitable 2D materials.
At the beginning of fabricating MESDs, one of the ignored but important issues is the selection of substrate, which must withstand some extreme conditions incorporating with other microdevices. Until now, the substrate can be divided into two categories: rigid (Si, Si/SiO2, glass and quartz) and flexible (polyethylene terephthalate, polyimide, polyvinyl alcohol, polydimethylsiloxane, paper and textile).51 For different purpose, a matching substrate should be selected to accommodate different electrode microfabrication techniques. For instance, ultrathin microelectronics are expected to be able to bear curing, rolling, folding and compressing, which also require the substrate to own these properties in this case. Therefore, the selection of suitable substrate is the first step toward fabricating MESDs.
2.1. MBs
Commercial RBs in the form of cylindrical or coin devices are incompatible with miniaturized autonomous device systems. Instead, MBs are more suitable for meeting the geometrical requirements of microelectronics. 2D materials have already displayed fascinating properties in MBs including good mechanical flexibility, short ion diffusion lengths, and a large exposed surface for redox reactions.52–55 In the following part, we will discuss the recent developments in MBs based on 2D cathode and anode materials.

2.1.1 2D cathode materials. 
2D cathode materials including 2D intercalation compounds (like LiCoO2 nanosheets), 2D TMOs (like V2O5 nanosheets), 2D conductive polymer nanosheets (such as polypyrrole), 2D MOFs, graphene-related composites, etc., have been reported for RBs.54,56–59 Nevertheless, due to the complex microelectrode fabrication methods and packaging technologies, there are only scarce examples of 2D cathode materials for MBs, which mainly involve graphene-based composites and graphene itself.60,61 For the graphene-based composite, graphene usually serves as the electron conducting additives for fabricating microelectrodes due to its extremely high surface/mass ratio, excellent flexibility and high electrical conductivity; while graphene itself can serve as an active cathode material for anion storage in MBs.62
In 2016, Hu et al. demonstrated a 3D printed interdigital MBs using a highly viscous graphene inks containing LiFePO4 cathode.34 Specifically, a typical concentrated graphene oxide (GO) ink (80 mg mL−1) containing the LiFePO4 cathode with high viscosity and optimum viscoelastic properties was layer-by-layer (LBL) printed and then arranged into an interdigital pattern using an extrusion-based 3D printing technique. The printed GO based electrodes were then freeze-dried for removing the water and thermally annealed for reduction and improvement of the electrical conductivity. The resultant 3D-printed LiFePO4/graphene cathode exhibited a specific capacity of 160 mA h g−1, approaching to the theoretical capacity of LiFePO4.34 The achieved value was much higher than those LiFePO4 cathodes using conventional carbon additives such as carbon black. Apart from the improvement of conductivity and specific capacity, graphene could effectively accommodate the volume expansion of electrode materials, leading to a markedly improved cycling performance. In addition, the construction of hierarchically porous graphene as conducting additives for loading active materials is favorable for the easy diffusion of electrolytes and fast kinetic of electrochemical reactions in MBs.
Different from the above case, few-layer graphene reversibly accommodates anions (PF6−, ClO4−, BF4−, etc.) at high voltages, which can thus be used as a cathode material for MBs.63,64 Because there was a large voltage difference in few-layer graphene for anion and cation storage, our group recently reported a dual-ion MB based on interdigital graphene electrodes with a thickness of ∼50 μm through a simple spray-coating technology (Fig. 3a). The quantity and density of graphene based microelectrodes could be controlled by adjusting the aqueous dispersion concentration of the electrochemically exfoliated graphene and spray-coating time. The fabricated dual-ion MBs exhibited a maximum areal capacity of 35 μA h cm−2 (Fig. 3b), which was comparable to those of LiCoO2-based thin-film MBs. Notably, for the PF6− intercalation into few-layer graphene cathode, there was a high irreversible capacity loss in the initial cycles. Such kind of irreversible capacity loss in the initial cycles usually does not happen in other cathode materials (like LiMn2O4 and LiFePO4) for Li-ion storage. Moreover, the initial charging process of the graphene based dual-ion MBs started at a higher voltage than that of the ongoing cycles. Presumably, there was an “activation” process during the first charge/discharge cycle in graphene electrode, which was further demonstrated by the density functional theory (DFT) calculation for the reaction profiles of anion transport across the graphene layers (Fig. 3c). The calculated energy barrier of the initial anion intercalation was much higher than those of the subsequent anion intercalations (Fig. 3d), suggesting that initial anions (PF6−) were required to widen the graphene interlayer gaps at the electrode/electrolyte interface. Furthermore, the widen graphene layers after the initial anion intercalation enabled the following anions to intercalate more easily.63 Currently, one major challenge of dual-ion MBs is the low volumetric energy density compared with commercial Li thin-film MBs. The theoretical specific capacity of the few-layer graphene (or graphite) cathode materials was relatively low (less than 125 mA h g−1 for C18PF6), which could not meet the ever-growing high-energy-density demand for their widespread applications.

2.1.2 2D anode materials. 
Because of the low redox potentials and ultrahigh specific capacities, a lot of van der Waals 2D materials have been explored as anode materials for RBs, such as TMD, MXene, graphene, germanane, and antimonene.44,65–68 However, similar to 2D cathode materials for MBs, there are only a few examples about 2D anode materials until recently, including MoS2 nanosheet and Si nanomembrane.
MoS2, as one of the most studied TMDs, is a highly attractive 2D anode material for MBs due to its large theoretical capacity (up to 670 mA h g−1). It possesses a layered structure with the weak van der Waals bonds between S–Mo–S layers. The interlayer spacing is 0.62 nm, which is beneficial for the intercalation of alkali metal ions. Nevertheless, the intrinsically low electrical conductivity due to its large band gap and large volume variation associated with a conversion mechanism usually lead to poor cycling stability and inferior rate capability. To address these issues, researchers constructed graphene–MoS2 hybrids as electrode materials for MBs. In 2014, Cui et al. demonstrated graphene nanosheets as good substrates for the growth of vertically aligned MoS2 sheets using a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method.69 The free of dangling bonds underlying graphene, such as boundaries and oxygen functional groups, could serve as nucleation sites for the van der Waals epitaxy of intermediate (MoO3−x) of MoS2. When the nuclei were formed, the MoO3−x crystals could grow along the vertical direction, producing vertical MoS2 sheets. As the result, the fabricated Li thin-film MB delivered an outstanding long-life cycling stability with a high areal capacity of 0.1 mA h cm−2 even after 1000 cycles, which was much better than the thin-film devices based on metal oxides (less than 100 cycles).69 In addition, compared with compact thin-film structure, the vertical designing of the thin-film electrode could offer more reaction sites for the electrolyte ions and facile accommodation of the strains over repeated cycles.
Apart from MoS2 anode, the Si anode based on the alloying/dealloying reaction is a promising anode for MBs owing to its extremely high specific capacities (lithiated to Li4.4Si with a theoretical capacity of 4200 mA h g−1), low working voltages, and natural abundances. Nevertheless, the huge volume change (>300%) during the lithiation/delithiation process poses a big challenge for the application of Si anodes, which may cause the electrode pulverization and capacity fade during cycles. In 2014, Schmidt et al. demonstrated that designing 2D structure in Si anode could alleviate the large volume change during electrochemical processes.70 A lab-on-chip MB with a single Si electrode derived from a 2D Si nanomembrane was assembled after infiltrating the liquid electrolyte and Li foil (Fig. 4a). Before lithiation, the Si nanomembrane had a smooth surface (Fig. 4b). After three cycles of lithiation/delithiation, the Si nanomembrane exhibited a highly wrinkled structure as shown in Fig. 4c. The wrinkles on the Si nanomembrane surface resulted from the huge volume change of the Si electrode during lithiation/delithiation. Generally, in bulk Si, the huge volume changes would lead to the pulverization of the electrodes because of strain-induced local deformation; in contrast, the Si nanomembrane electrode could accommodate large volume strains through forming a wrinkled structure, thus solving the poor cycle issues. In addition, at relatively low voltages, the currents through the Si nanomembrane gradually increased with the voltage changes (Fig. 4d and e), which could be attributed to the formation of conductive LixSi alloy. The increase and decrease of conductivity during lithiation/delithiation is suitable for real-time analysis of the electrochemical reaction in the microelectrode. Thus, such kind of MB provides a facile and direct way to monitor the electrochemical behavior of 2D materials.

Overall, the development of 2D materials based MBs is just at the beginning. Table 1 summarizes the related in-plane and 3D MBs reported in recent years. Notably, the electrochemical properties (especially cycle lives) of MBs are still far from the levels required for practical applications. Since all these 2D materials in MBs were demonstrated to show excellent cycling stability in traditional battery configurations, the poor electrochemical performance of MBs may be related to the procedure of electrode fabrication and processing. Thus, it is of vital importance to improve the current processing methods to control and tune the thickness, composition, porosity, and homogeneity of the electrodes, as well as develop new low-cost manufacturing methods to fabricate MBs with high energy, power densities, and excellent cycling stability.

2.2. MSCs
MSCs, as a new generation of microsized power source, have attracted considerable attention owing to their ultrahigh power densities, fast rate capabilities, and excellent cycle lifetimes.85–87 Several studies have already reviewed fiber-shape MSCs;46,47,88,89 thus in this review we will only focus on in-plane and 3D MSCs. Unlike fiber-shape MSCs for wearable electronics,90,91 in-plane and 3D MSCs are usually designed for implantable and portable microdevices. Various 2D materials such as graphene, TMOs/TMHs, TMDs, MXenes, and 2D organic framework materials have been demonstrated to fabricate thin films or microelectrode finger arrays for MSCs.
On the other hand, the microfabrication technologies for microelectrodes of MSCs can be classified into two categories. The first category refers to the direct synthesis of electrode materials on the patterned current collectors. The related techniques including CVD,92–94 laser scribing,95–108 pyrolysis,109–114 and electrolytic deposition115–119 have been developed to realize MSCs. The second category involves indirect fabrication based on the existing electrode materials in powder or solution states. The microelectrode finger arrays can be constructed by inkjet printing,120–132 spray coating,93,127,133–138 drop and spin coating,139–141 vacuum filtration,142–144 LBL assembly,145–150 and electrophoretic deposition.151,152 In this respect, the preparation of a stable dispersion with good solution processability is the vital concern. The advantages and disadvantages of the strategies mentioned above are detailed in Table 2.

2.2.1 Graphene. 
Graphene is the most extensively studied 2D material for MSCs owing to its unique 2D structural features associated with large specific surface area, high mechanical strength, chemical stability, and superior electrical conductivity.11,153 The theoretical capacitance of single-layer graphene was reported to be approximately 21 μF cm−2.154 In principle, a graphene-based SC could achieve a capacitance of approximately 550 F g−1 if its entire surface area could be fully exploited. Thus far, a variety of strategies, such as CVD growth,93,101 liquid-phase exfoliation,120,125,126,155,156 electrochemical exfoliation,127,157–159 laser reduction,102,108,160 chemical and thermal reduction,96,161–165 have been developed to fabricate graphene-based capacitive and Faradic film microelectrodes, as discussed below.
CVD-grown graphene for MSCs. 
CVD is an attractive method for fabricating high-quality graphene for microelectrodes. In 2014, Fischer et al.92 reported the micrometers-thick graphitic petal microelectrodes by using microwave plasma CVD growth, optical lithography and reactive ion etching. After electrochemical oxidation treatment in an aqueous acidic solution, the enhancement of surface wettability with introduced oxygen-rich functional groups rendered easy accessibility of electrolyte ions to the microelectrodes. As a result, the fabricated MSCs exhibited an energy density of 9.5 mW h cm−3 at a scan rate of 20 mV s−1 and a power density of 235 W cm−3 at a scan rate of 50 V s−1, much higher than those of MSCs without electrochemical treatment. Although the porous structure and great electrical conductivity of CVD-grown graphene microelectrodes resulted in high power density, the limited mass loading per unit area or volume was the limiting factor for the low energy density. In situ growth or electrodeposition of high pseudocapacitive materials such as RuO2, MnO2, and polyaniline (PANI) on CVD-grown graphene microelectrodes may offer promising strategies to improve the energy densities.
Solution-processable high-quality graphene for MSCs. 
Liquid-phase exfoliation of graphite by ultrasonication is a promising strategy for the production of high-quality graphene due to its simplicity and scalability.166,167 The solution-processable graphene flakes can be used to fabricate microelectrode finger arrays by inkjet printing.168 For example, in 2013, Li et al.120 prepared stable high-concentration inks (1 mg mL−1) with ultrasound-exfoliated graphene flakes for printing MSCs. Nonetheless, this exfoliation process required long-last agitation (40 h), delivering low exfoliation yields (∼1%) and small sheet sizes (<1 μm). In the last few years, electrochemical exfoliation of graphite has emerged as an attractive method,169–171 which produced electrochemically exfoliated graphene (EG) with large sheet size, large carbon to oxygen ratio and high electrical conductivity. In addition, EG can be processed into high-concentration graphene inks for printing MSCs. For example, in 2016, our group demonstrated directly printable in-plane MSCs using EG inks (0.8 mg mL−1). The fabricated MSCs on paper substrates offered an areal capacitance as high as 5.4 mF cm−2. Later in 2017, we reported the fabrication of EG inks with even higher concentration (2.3 mg mL−1), containing ethyl cellulose as stabilizer and mixed solvent of cyclohexanone and terpineol.172 Due to the high electrical conductivity, the printed EG could serve as both the electrodes and current collectors. More importantly, poly(4-styrenesulfonic acid) (PSSH) ink acting as a solid-state electrolyte was directly printed onto the surface of EG interdigital electrodes (Fig. 5a). The SEM image (Fig. 5b) manifested that the printed EG microelectrode patterns containing large graphene flakes were highly uniform. As displayed in Fig. 5c, the fabricated EG-based MSCs exhibited an areal capacitance of approximately 0.7 mF cm−2. This simple fabrication process allowed for easy and efficient integration of the MSCs array in arbitrary connections to a large scale. For instance, large-scale MSC arrays consisting of more than 100 devices were manufactured on both rigid Si/SiO2 wafer and flexible Kapton substrate (Fig. 5d). The cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves at different scan rates showed that the arrays could deliver 12 V at 1 V s−1 (Fig. 5e). Thus, the relatively mature printing technology and commercially available printers make inkjet printing promising for mass-produced MSCs for potential industrial scale.

rGO for MSCs. 
Apart from high-quality graphene produced by CVD and exfoliation methods described above, rGO from reduction of GO has been applied in the fabrication of graphene microelectrodes.173–180 In 2011, Ajayan et al.160 firstly reduced and patterned hydrated GO films by laser irradiation. A porous morphology was formed due to the gas release from the decomposition of the functional groups and water upon localized laser heating. This was beneficial to ion accessibility during electrochemical measurements. Laser-scribing technique has advantages for fabricating MSCs due to its simple, scalable, clean, and cost-effective process. Similarly, later in 2012, Kaner et al. reported a standard LightScribe DVD optical drive for the direct laser reduction of GO to graphene.102,162,181,182 The prepared mechanically robust, highly electrical conductive rGO film with large specific surface area was extended for direct use in MSCs. More than 100 MSCs were produced on a single disc in 30 min or less. The rGO-based MSCs exhibited a power density of 200 W cm−3, a frequency response of 19 ms, and a low leakage current. Afterwards, in order to improve the power density, our group demonstrated in 2013, graphene-based in-plane MSCs based on methane plasma reduced graphene (MPG) films micropatterned on both rigid and flexible substrates.144 Due to the high electrical conductivity (345 S cm−1) of the MPG interdigital electrode, the resultant MSCs delivered an areal capacitance of 80.7 μF cm−2 and a stack capacitance of 17.9 F cm−3 with PVA/H2SO4 gel electrolyte; moreover, these devices showed a volumetric power density of 495 W cm−3 and energy density of 2.5 mW h cm−3.
Although the performance of rGO-based MSCs has been significantly improved by developing above scalable manufacturing technologies and designed architectures, their power and energy densities remained much lower than those of electrolytic capacitors and lithium thin-film batteries. Heteroatom doping in rGO could considerably enhance its capacitance through additional Faradaic reactions, also known as pseudocapacitance effects.148,183,184 In this respect, in 2014, our group reported a nitrogen and boron co-doped graphene film by the LBL assembly and thermal annealing treatment of hybrid film based on anionic GO nanosheets and cationic poly-L-lysine.148 The fabricated MSCs provided pronounced pseudocapacitive behavior with volumetric capacitance of 488 F cm−3, higher than that of nitrogen-doped graphene (425 F cm−3) and undoped rGO (245 F cm−3).
Porous graphene for MSCs. 
The inevitable aggregation of graphene nanosheets severely reduces the available surface area and limits electron and ion transport in MSCs. Therefore, porous graphene is a fascinating material for MSCs. In 2014, Tour et al.185,186 demonstrated a scalable approach for producing and patterning porous graphene films directly from commercial polyimide film. Photothermal conversion of sp3-carbon atoms to sp2-carbon atoms was demonstrated by pulsed laser irradiation (Fig. 6a). As depicted in Fig. 6b, the aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscope (Cs-STEM) image showed the unusual ultra-polycrystalline feature of laser-induced graphene (LIG) flakes with disordered-grain boundaries. These defects could enhance electrochemical capacitance, as supported by theoretical calculations. SEM image of LIG film showed the porous foam structure resulting from the rapid liberation of gaseous products (Fig. 6c). The LIG prepared with a laser power of 5.4 W exhibited an electrical conductivity of ∼25 S cm−1, which was much higher than that of laser-reduced GO.187 LIG-based in-plane MSCs delivered an areal capacitance of 4 mF cm−2 and a power density of approximately 9 mW cm−2 (Fig. 6d–i). However, the reported technique suffers from the limited compatibility with other substrates beyond polyimide.188–190

The aggregation of graphene could be also alleviated by hole structure191–193 and nanochannel design.194,195 For instance, in 2015, Lee et al.194 fabricated nanochanneled graphene film with the acid etchant for the removal of Cu(OH)2 nanowires. The resultant hollow-graphene-based MSCs showed a volumetric capacitance of 368 F cm−3 at a current density of 0.3 A cm−3, superior to that of the nonporous-graphene-based MSCs (98 F cm−3), benefiting from efficient 2D ion transport pathways.
Graphene-based composites for MSCs. 
Graphene-based composites have been widely applied in MSCs with improved electrochemical performance due to the synergistic effects of graphene and other components.196–202 For instance, in 2015, our group reported an alternately stacked PANI–graphene (PANI–G) and EG nanohybrid film as electrode materials for MSCs (Fig. 7a and b).203 The optimal proportion of the alternately stacked structure was two PANI–G layers and three EG layers (denoted as P2G3). P2G3-based MSCs delivered areal and volumetric capacitances of 210 mF cm−2 and 436 F cm−3 at 10 mV s−1, respectively (Fig. 7c and d). Such outstanding performance was attributed to the unique alternately stacked structure with a strong coupling effect between 2D pseudocapacitive PANI–G and capacitive EG nanosheets with accessible ion-transporting channels, an elastic spatial confinement effect, and a rapid electron transport pathway. In 2018, Fan et al. fabricated graphene-based mixed-dimensional hybrid aerogels (MDHA) for 3D-printing MSCs.204 The hybrid ink with concentration up to 55 mg mL−1 was prepared by mixing MWCNTs, gluconic-δ-lactone and urea with GO dispersion. The 3D-printed interconnected hierarchical pores established unobstructed channels for ion transport in graphene/MWCNT MDHA. The achieved 3D MSCs delivered a maximum areal capacitance of 639 mF cm−2 at a current density of 4 mA cm−2 and sustained 90% capacitance after 10000 GCD cycles at 40 mA cm−2.

2.2.2 TMOs/TMHs. 
Among various pseudocapacitive 2D materials, layered TMOs and TMHs have been widely studied due to their large theoretical capacities (typically 300–1500 F g−1), chemical stability and compatibility with electrolytes. They show multiple oxidation states, thus enabling rich redox reactions between electrodes and electrolyte ions.205–210 As electrode materials for SCs, charge storage mainly arises from the pseudocapacitance caused by the fast redox reactions on their surfaces.211–214 However, the poor electrical conductivity of layered TMOs/TMHs limits their coulombic efficiencies. For example, TMOs/TMHs usually possess low rate capability and poor cycling stability owing to the inherently poor electronic conductivity, slow reaction kinetics, and severe volume expansion during discharge/charge cycles. To overcome these obstacles, implanting defects/holes or vacancies, doping with other metallic elements and integrating with conductive matrix can be effective strategies. For instance, layered TMOs/TMHs such as MnO2,131,205,206,211,215–223 V2O5,224 Bi2O3,207 Co3O4,209 Co(OH)2,225–227 Ni(OH)2,213,228 FeOOH229 have been composited with graphene, carbon nanotubes (CNTs), or metals, generating hybrid microelectrode materials for MSCs with enhanced performance. The status of performances of typical MSCs based on these materials is listed in Table 3.

Compared with symmetric MSCs using either EDLC or pseudocapacitive materials, asymmetric MSCs (AMSCs) in which positive and negative electrodes consisting of different active materials show superior overall performance.216,225,230–237 Specifically, pseudocapacitive materials in one side of electrodes depend on a reversible redox reaction to serve as the energy source, whereas EDLC materials in another electrode store charge on the surface and supply high levels of power. The AMSCs with such design provide high capacitances and wide operation voltage windows of more than 1 V. For instance, in 2015, Kaner et al. demonstrated a 3D AMSC based on laser-scribed graphene–MnO2 (LSG–MnO2) as the positive electrode and LSG as the negative electrode using a laser-scribing technique and an electrodeposition method.28 A charge balance between the two electrodes was obtained by precisely controlling the deposition time of MnO2 nanosheets at the positive electrode and the thickness of the graphene film at the negative electrode. The achieved 3D AMSCs retained high rate capability with scan rates of up to 10000 mV s−1 and presented a wide potential window of 2.0 V in aqueous Na2SO4 electrolyte to afford a high volumetric energy density of 42 mW h cm−3. The combination of such laser-induction technique and the electrodeposition method for AMSCs (Fig. 8a) was later employed in 2016 by Tour et al.229 They electrodeposited three types of pseudocapacitive materials onto LIG, including MnO2, FeOOH, and PANI. The areal and volumetric capacitances of LIG–FeOOH//LIG–MnO2 AMSC reached 21.9 mF cm−2 and 5.4 F cm−3, respectively, at a current density of 0.25 mA cm−2 with a potential window of 1.8 V (Fig. 8b and c). Moreover, the maximum areal and volumetric power densities were as high as 11853 μW cm−2 and 2891 mW cm−3, respectively.

2.2.3 TMDs. 
Mono- and few-layer TMDs have attracted significant attention due to their tunable band gaps and vast natural reserves.238–243 TMDs are a class of materials with the formula of MX2, where M stands for a transition metal element from group IV to group VIII, and X is a chalcogen (S, Se, or Te).244 Bulk TMDs have diverse physical properties, including insulators such as HfS2, semiconductors such as SnS2 and MoS2, semi-metals such as TiS2 and WTe2, and true metals such as TaS2 and VSe2. Metallic TMDs with high conductivities and large specific areas are favorable electrode materials for MSCs.245,246
As one typical member of metallic TMDs, large-sized metallic sub-nanopore TaS2 (MSP-TaS2) was recently reported for MSCs by Xie et al.246 Specifically, Fig. 9a showed the fabrication process of an acid-assisted exfoliation of single-crystalline TaS2, achieving exfoliated metallic TaS2 monolayer with tens of micrometers size and controllable in-plane sub-nanopores (0.95 nm). Hydrogen ion from the acid was utilized as an efficient and easily accessible assistant in simultaneous exfoliation and structural modification of TaS2. The fast ion transport was achieved in TaS2 monolayers due to their pore size matching well with that of electrolyte ion. MSP-TaS2-based MSCs delivered a volumetric capacitance of 508 F cm−3 at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1, which was about three times higher than that of small-sized (<1 μm) intact TaS2-based MSCs (Fig. 9b and c). It could be explained by the fact that MSP-TaS2 film had much higher electrical conductivity and appropriate-sized pores allowing Li+ penetration from the surface throughout the whole framework. In addition, the MSP-TaS2-based MSCs retained a capacitance in excess of 92% after 4000 cycles, indicating a good cycling stability (Fig. 9d).

Superior to above single-phase chalcogenides, the strongly coupled mixed-metal chalcogenides may synergistically enhance the electrochemical properties such as reversible capacity and electrical/ionic conductivity, which can yield improved electrochemical performance.247 In 2016, Moosavifard et al. developed a facile, scalable and low cost process for fabricating LSG/CoNi2S4//LSG hybrid MSCs by combining direct laser reduction and selective electrodeposition (Fig. 10a).235 Employing Faradaic LSG/CoNi2S4 as a positive electrode and EDLC LSG as a negative electrode in the hybrid MSC (Fig. 10b), the operating potential window could reach 1.7 V (Fig. 10c). Two pairs of redox peaks were attributable to the reversible Faradaic reactions of Co2+/Co3+/Co4+ and Ni2+/Ni3+ in alkaline PVA/KOH electrolyte. As shown in Fig. 10d, the LSG/CoNi2S4//LSG hybrid MSC delivered an excellent energy density up to 49 mW h cm−3, and one individual device was able to power a red light-emitting diode (LED).

2.2.4 MXenes. 
MXenes (Mn+1Xn) are a class of emerging layered materials derived from Mn+1AXn precursors (M = Ti, V, Nb, etc.; A = Al, Si, Sn, etc.; n = 1, 2, or 3).248–255 MAX phases show layered, hexagonal structures with M layers packed closely together in nearly hexagonal configurations. The A-element layers in MAX can be selectively etched by aqueous-fluoride-containing acidic solutions to obtain MXenes. Owing to the aqueous medium used during synthesis, MXene flakes are terminated with numerous surface functional groups containing O, OH, or F. MXenes exhibit good metallic conductivity and mechanical properties as well as hydrophilicity, making them good candidates for batteries and SCs.256–266 The maximum theoretical capacity for MXenes was estimated to be ∼615 C g−1.267
In 2016, Gogotsi et al.133 fabricated all solid-state MSCs with MXene serving as both the current collector (highly conductive, large-size (3–6 μm) Ti3C2Tx (L-Ti3C2Tx) flakes) and active material (small-size (1 μm) Ti3C2Tx (s-Ti3C2Tx) flakes) by a spray-coating method and direct laser cutting, as illustrated in Fig. 11a and b. The cross-sectional SEM image of the L-s-Ti3C2Tx film demonstrated the restacking of the MXene flakes with good alignment, beneficial to the side-by-side ion/electron transport between microelectrodes (Fig. 11c). Compared with other types of MSCs based on Ti3C2Tx, L-s-Ti3C2Tx MSC exhibited the best performance with an areal capacitance of 27.3 mF cm−2 and a volumetric capacitance of 356.8 F cm−3 (Fig. 11d–f). The MSC displayed excellent cycling stability without capacitance decay after 10000 cycles at 50 mV s−1.

2.2.5 2D organic framework materials. 
2D organic framework materials including 2D MOFs and 2D COFs are an emerging class of porous crystalline materials with designable periodical porous structure and tunable functionality.268–270 The heteroatoms (B, N, O and S) on the precise locations of frameworks may exhibit redox activity for the pseudocapacitance. The high porosity from organic molecular assembly is beneficial to generate electrical double layer capacitance.271,272 Thus, 2D MOFs and COFs are regarded as potential electrode materials for electrochemical energy storage. However, the application of 2D organic framework materials in MSCs has been hindered by the lack of feasible microfabrication methods. In 2017, our group demonstrated a facile LBL method for fabricating on-chip MSCs based on an azulene-bridged coordination polymer framework (PiCBA) (Fig. 12).273 Considering its rich aromatic skeleton, ultralow band gap, good carrier mobility, and permanent dipole moment of the azulene unit, PiCBA is a promising candidate for electrochemical energy storage. Therefore, PiCBA layers were directly grown onto the Au surface of the interdigital Au–SiO2 substrate through the upright η1 coordination of the terminal isocyanide carbon atoms and then integrated to fabricating MSCs using a PVA/H2SO4 gel electrolyte. The resultant MSCs delivered a specific capacitance of 34.1 F cm−3 at 50 mV s−1 and a volumetric power density of 1323 W cm−3.

In general, apart from the above related fabrication methods demonstrated for various 2D active materials in MSCs, many other techniques such as painting,274–276 filling,277–280 and rolled-up technologies281,282 have been utilized to fabricate patterned electrode finger arrays or thin films. The realization of one MSC usually requires the combination of these different techniques. Table 3 summarizes fabricated in-plane and 3D MSCs based on 2D active materials reported in recent years.

3. Smart responsive MESDs
Along with the growing demand for intelligent electronic devices, extensive attentions have been paid to the smart or stimuli-responsive devices, which are responsive to the changes from either the external environment or devices themselves.285–293 Recently, smart functions, including self-healing,294,295 electrochromism,296,297 stretchability,298 shape memory,299 photoluminescent,300 photodetection,301 and thermal responsivity,302–305 have been introduced into stimuli-responsive devices, which showed significant promise in the fields of healthcare, modern optoelectronics, biomimetic, artificial intelligence, and energy-related devices. However, the research and development of smart responsive MESDs are still at the early stage due to the poor compatibility among those stimuli, active materials, and processing technologies. Suitable materials, device designs, and appropriate performance levels are crucial for the practical applications of MESDs integrated with smart functions.
Currently, developments of functional electrolyte and functional electrode are two main strategies for introducing smart functions in MESDs. For example, in 2017, our group demonstrated the stimulus-responsive MSC (SR-MSC) with a reversible electrochromic window, as schematically illustrated in Fig. 13a.306 By taking advantage of the synergistic effect of V2O5 nanoribbons and EG nanosheets, EG/V2O5 hybrid nanopaper was prepared as an electrode for MSCs, which provided a volumetric capacitance of 130.7 F cm−3 and a volumetric energy density of approximately 20 mW h cm−3 at 10 mV s−1. Colorless viologen (MV2+), a type of electrochromic molecule, could be reversibly reduced to the radical ion derivative of viologen (purple MV+) upon accepting electrons (Fig. 13b). By using a PVA/LiCl gel electrolyte mixed with the methyl viologen, the resultant SR-MSCs exhibited a remarkable reversible electrochromic effect during the charge–discharge process within 0–1 V, providing a directly observable visual indication of their charge–discharge states (Fig. 13c and d). Very recently, we reported a novel thermoswitchable MSC with the self-protection function utilizing the thermodynamic behavior of a smart electrolyte, namely a lithium salt-dissolved polymer sol, poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)-g-methylcellulose.305 Benefiting from the reversibility of ionic conductivity, the MSC exhibited a broad temperature window (30–80 °C) and totally switch-off behavior at 80 °C, as well as excellent cycling stability upon heating/cooling cycles. In the above two cases, the additive with smart function should be compatible with the chemical and physical properties of the electrolyte, without sacrificing the electrochemical performance of the MSCs.

Apart from the electrolyte, designing functional electrode is another pathway to realize a smart response in MESDs. Surface functionalization of 2D electrode materials with functional molecules can be a straightforward method. In 2017, Müllen et al. demonstrated a photoswitchable MSC using a thin-film electrode based on diarylethene (DAE) adsorbed on the surface of graphene electrodes, thus creating a DAE–graphene (DAE–G) composite.94 The efficient photo-isomerization behavior of DAE molecules was ascribed to reversible control of EDLC performance in the DAE–G composite. Photoswitching of the specific capacitance was enabled by the reversible control of interfacial charge injection into DAE molecular orbitals owing to charge transfer at the DAE–G interface upon light modulation. Nevertheless, the reversible ratio up to 20% was not high, possibly owing to the poor compatibility between graphene and DAE.
4. Smart integrated system
Although much progress has been made towards realizing high-performance MESDs in the past years as discussed above, much efforts remain needed for the practical applications of individual MESDs. Currently, most electronic devices are powered by bulky external power sources; externally connected power sources require space and energy. The recent boom in portable and implantable microelectronics has resulted in increasing requirements for self-powered systems. According to the electrochemical performances of the state-of-the-art MESDs mentioned above, MBs can achieve the areal energy density of 10−2–101 mW h cm−2 and MSCs can attain the areal power density of 10−1–103 mW cm−2. On the other hand, the energy for powering microelectronics such as digital display and UV sensor is usually from microwatts to watts. Thus, connecting individual MESD in series and parallel is a commonly used approach to achieve the required specific voltages and capacitances, which can be realized by rationally designing the structure of microelectrodes and the interconnections between them.158 As the result, MESDs can be coupled with microsized energy harvesters to demonstrate high peak power, long lifetime, and high rate capability while maintaining reasonable energy densities for practical microelectronics.307–310 Although some novel self-powered systems have been demonstrated (Table 4),311–313 the development of smart integrated system based on MESDs is still in its infancy.

MESDs/energy harvesting integrated systems
Numerous energy harvesting/conversion technologies including solar cells, piezoelectric generators, triboelectric generators, and thermoelectric generators have been developed in the past several decades, which can effectively convert renewable energy sources such as solar, mechanical, and thermal energy into electricity.219,314 Unsatisfactorily, a big shortcoming of these renewable sources is that electricity generation is highly dependent on their availability. In this regard, an effective strategy is to develop an integrated energy harvesting, conversion, and storage system that can simultaneously capture energy from the environment and store it by electrochemical energy storage devices.315–317 Such intelligent integration is also applicable to miniaturized integrated energy systems.
Converting solar energy into electrical energy provides an attractive way to build energy-autonomous systems. In 2016, Watanabe et al. constructed a self-powered system by combining a commercial solar panel as the energy harvester, a LIG-based MSC as the energy storage unit and stabilizer, and a digital LCD clock as the working device, as illustrated in Fig. 14a.95 The simultaneous function of the MSC as both energy storage unit and stabilizer was confirmed by recording the current and voltage changes of the different systems (Fig. 14b and c). These results clearly demonstrated the potential of such self-powered systems for wide-ranging applications in the future.

In addition to solar cell, various mechanical energies including wind, wave, and fluid motion can be also efficiently converted into electricity to power microdevices by using piezoelectric or triboelectric effects.318–321 Among diverse nanogenerators, triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) have been extensively developed to extract almost all forms of ambient mechanical energies, especially human-motion-induced biomechanical energy, owing to the high output performance levels with their light weight.190 For example, in 2018, Alshareef et al. reported a biocompatible self-charging power unit based on a TENG, a MXene-based MSC, and a rectifier.320 It was sealed compactly by silicone rubber to harvest and store energy from human activities (Fig. 14d and e). The MXene-based MSC delivered a capacitance of 23 mF cm−2 with 95% capacitance retention up to 10000 charge–discharge cycles, while the TENG exhibited a maximum output power of 7.8 μW cm−2. Fig. 14f illustrated the self-charging capability under hand clapping and the overall charging curve can be divided into 5 regions with alternative clapping and resting operations. It took about 30 min to charge the MSC to 0.6 V when continuously clapping without large current leakage.
MESDs/sensing integrated systems
To acquire and transfer signals in sensing and communication procedures, self-powered sensors need power on the order of microwatts to milliwatts.322–327 Adjustable power sources are essential for such low-energy applications. MESDs can offer enough power or voltage for such integrated systems. Self-powered photodetectors/sensors can be used for continuously and suitably monitoring personal healthcare and external environment without interruption.
UV photodetectors are able to convert UV light into electrical signals, which are important devices and used in various applications such as environmental monitoring, flame detection, and missile warning systems.140,328–330 Several self-powered UV photodetection systems have been recently fabricated by combining the MESDs with UV detectors.95,161,224,331,332 As another increasingly common type of sensor, gas sensors have attracted increasing attention on environmental and safety monitoring. Integrating MESDs with a gas sensor makes the electronic device systems compact and lightweight, thus favoring their applications in portable and implantable electronics.333–336 In 2017, Yan et al. reported an integrated device on one piece of paper.336 AMSCs were integrated with a gas (NH3 and HCl) sensor and charged by connecting it to a solar cell. After being charged for 78 s, AMSCs achieved an open-circuit potential of 2.8 V and drove the gas sensor readily. The current alternately decreased and increased with the alternative introduction of NH3 and HCl, proving the feasibility of this sustainably self-powered integrated device.
5. Summary and outlook
Emerging electrochemically active 2D materials open up a new window for the future development of high-performance, reliable and up-scalable MESDs. This review article has summarized recent achievements in versatile 2D materials, microfabrication methods and design techniques for MESDs. 2D materials, including graphene, TMOs/TMHs, TMDs, MXenes, and 2D organic framework materials have been studied in terms of their electrochemical properties for MSCs and MBs (Table 5). On the other hand, device fabrication plays a key role in technology innovation that, in turn, influences the complexity and large-scale production of MESDs. It is also believed that introducing smart functions and integrating microdevices into systems are indispensable for promoting the robust growth of smart electronics. Considerable achievements in 2D materials based MESDs have been made in the fields of individual devices; and more recently, integrated systems based on such MESDs have been demonstrated which clearly highlight their potential application scopes. Nevertheless, some key technical challenges still need to be addressed. These include aspects such as individual device performance improvement, smart response design, and microdevice integration, as discussed below.

Aiming at the state-of-the-art MESD performance, structural engineering of 2D materials provides the solid foundation for tuning the chemical and physical properties including electrical conductivity, redox potential, crystal phase structure, and chemical stability. Approaches like heteroatom doping, defect/vacancy creation, surface/interface modification and heterostructure construction provide great opportunities for further improving the physicochemical properties of 2D materials. It is also well known that one big challenge faced by 2D materials lies in their inevitable aggregation due to their strong van der Waals interactions. To address this, one can enlarge the interlayer space toward improved storage capability or increased active sites by means of intercalation with guest molecules. Besides, for MESDs, vertically oriental 2D materials directly grown on interdigital current collectors is beneficial to achieving low interfacial resistance and facilitated charge transport. Moreover, in order to reach enhanced specific surface area and superior conductivity, combining different materials with 2D hybrids is a viable approach to overcome the limitations of each components. Certainly, novel 2D materials with interesting electrochemical properties are always highly desirable. For instance, 2D materials such as silicene, graphdiyne, germanene, borophene, tellurene, and phosphorene with large specific surface area and good electrical conductivity can be potential candidates for high-performance MESDs. Nevertheless, due to their intrinsic instability of the surface with chemical degradation under ambient conditions, surface functionalization or coatings of these 2D materials will be required. On the other hand, the emerging conductive MOFs with stacked π-conjugated 2D layers, controllable pore size and high specific surface area are also appealing electrode materials for energy storage applications. More importantly, the scalability and processability of high-quality 2D materials are essential not only for fundamental research, but also for the real industrial applications which require advanced microfabrication technologies including inkjet printing, 3D printing, and screen printing, etc.
In order to meet the demand for intelligent electronic devices, smart responsive MESDs have emerged as functional power sources. However, due to the miniaturized structure and complicated preparation process, only limited efforts have been devoted to developing MESDs with smart functions such as self-healing, compressibility, electrochromism, and stretchability. In this regard, it is important to use functional electrolytes or electrodes that are compatible with their working conditions and device structures. A variety of multi-responsive polymers like photosensitive, water-soluble, pH-sensitive, thermo-, electric-, and magnetic-responsive polymers can be further taken into consideration for the design of smart electrolytes. Furthermore, surface functionalization of 2D active materials sheds a light into the smart electrodes, due to the flexibility of tuning the electrical conductivity, surface area, as well as ion transport within the electrolyte. Therefore, the exploration of smart materials is equally important to the development of microfabrication technologies for MESDs.
As micropower sources and energy storage microdevices, MESDs based on 2D materials are ultimately aimed at powering ready-to-use energy-consuming microelectronics. Owing to the complicated fabrication process of smart integrated systems, only few works have been demonstrated so far. Thus, innovative self-powered integrated systems involving energy harvesting, energy storage, and energy consumption units represents a highly attractive research direction. In addition, the design of smart integrated system with foldable, washable, and biodegradable features can pave the way for future intelligent, independent and continuous operation of daily electronics. At last, these all-in-one self-powered systems could be highly expected to benefit healthcare applications in the future.
