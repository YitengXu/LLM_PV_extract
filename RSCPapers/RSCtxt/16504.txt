    , Accepted 9th August 2014First published on 11th August 2014AbstractPerovskite-based solar cells have received much recent research attention for renewable-energy applications because of their high efficiency and long-term stability. Here, we report perovskite solar cells formed using a scaffold layer composed of size-controlled SiO2 nanoparticles (NPs). The infiltration of perovskite into the scaffold layer depended strongly on the size of the SiO2 NPs. We investigated the effects of scaffold layers comprised of SiO2 NPs that were 15, 30, 50, 70, and 100 nm in diameter on the properties of perovskite films. The performance of perovskite solar cells based on 50 nm diameter SiO2 NPs exhibited a current density (Jsc) of 16.4 mA cm−2, a open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.05 V, and a power-conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.45%, which represent a significant improvement compared with perovskite solar cells fabricated using a TiO2 scaffold layer, where Jsc = 17.3 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.94 V, and the PCE was 10.29%.
Solid-state sensitized solar cells have attracted much research interest over the past two decades because of their long-term stability and low costs.1–4 However, a significant drawback of solid-state sensitized solar cells is the low power-conversion efficiency (PCE), which is typically less than 7.5%.5 Approaches to improve the photovoltaic performance include the use of additives such as lithium salt bis(trifluoromethane sulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI) and tris(2-(1H-pyrazol-1-yl)pyridine)cobalt(III) (FK102) with spiro-MeOTAD, which can significantly increase the conductivity of the electrolyte, leading to an increase in the PCE.5,6 In addition, the use of 4-tert-butylpyridine (tBP) has also been shown to increase the open-circuit voltage due to a decrease in the charge-carrier recombination rate and the interface-defect density.7 Furthermore, various hole transporting materials (HTMs) such as poly(2,6-(4,4-bis-(2-ethylhexyl)-4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b;3,4-b′]dithiophene)-alt-4,7(2,1,3 benzothiadiazole)) (PCPDTBT) and poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) have been applied to improve the PCE.8 In spite of these advances, however, achieving a high PCE remains challenging for solid-state sensitized solar cells.
Solid-state perovskite solar cells have been the focus of recent research into solid-state sensitized solar cells because of their superior light-harvesting ability in the solar spectrum, leading to a high PCE.9–16 The absorption coefficient of perovskite is 1.5 × 104 cm−1 with a 550 nm thick scaffold film, which is one order of magnitude larger than that previously reported for solid-state sensitized solar cells, and is larger than that of ruthenium-based N719 dye or molecular-based organic dyes.17,18 Thus, effective infiltration, coverage, and coating of perovskite onto the working electrode are highly desirable in order to increase the PCE of solar cells.
Methods to improve the infiltration, coverage, and coating of perovskite onto working electrodes have been reported. For example, the solubility of the perovskite precursor depends on the solvent used. Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), dimethyl formamide (DMF), and γ-butyrolactone have been reported as solvents for perovskite precursors; DMSO can be used to achieve a high concentration of the precursor with a solubility of up to 60 wt%, which allows for the formation of a dense perovskite film, resulting in a PCE of up to 10.8%.19 Planar heterojunction perovskite solar cells with full coverage of perovskite formed by vapour-deposition presented a significantly improved PCE of up to 15.4%.20
In addition, the morphology of the perovskite film can be controlled by varying the temperature and time. Optimized devices with full surface coverage of a perovskite film on working electrodes have exhibited a PCE of up to 11.4%.21 In addition, various nanomaterials, including TiO2, Al2O3, ZrO2, and ZnO, have been applied as scaffold layers to increase the perovskite loading on the working electrode of the solar cell.22–28 In particular, perovskite solar cells with Al2O3 or ZrO2 scaffold layers exhibit a large open-circuit voltage Voc because the conduction band energies of Al2O3 and ZrO2 are higher than that of perovskite, so that electrons cannot readily transfer into the conduction band of either layer.22,29 Moreover, infiltration of viscous perovskite solution into the working electrode is also an important issue because the scaffold materials cannot transfer the photo-generated electrons to the working electrode. The size of nanoparticles contained in the scaffold layer could affect the infiltration of viscous perovskite solution into the working electrode. However, the infiltration depending on the nanoparticle size of the scaffold layer into the working electrode has not yet been studied. Thus, there is a requirement for optimized designs of scaffold layers, and an associated development of materials.
Here, we report perovskite solar cells formed using size-controlled SiO2 nanoparticles (NPs) as a scaffold layer. The mono-dispersed SiO2 NPs could be easily synthesized to get the desired size by changing the fabrication temperature in comparison with other scaffold materials. The infiltration of perovskite into the scaffold layer was investigated with various diameter SiO2 NPs. The infiltration was optimized by controlling the size of the SiO2 NPs. 50 nm diameter SiO2 NPs resulted in perovskite solar cells with the highest PCE, which was 11.45%. This compares favorably with TiO2-based perovskite solar cells, which had a PCE of 10.29%. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on the infiltration of perovskite into a scaffold layer composed of SiO2 NPs with systematically varied diameters.
SiO2 NPs with diameters of 15, 30, 50, 70, and 100 nm were synthesized via a sol–gel method.30,31 The SiO2 NPs were formed into a scaffold layer by spin coating, and the thickness was adjusted by controlling the number of spin-coating repetitions. A CH3NH3PbI3−xClx perovskite absorption and electron transport material was infiltrated into the SiO2 scaffold layer. 2,2′,7,7′-Tetrakis-(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) was deposited onto the perovskite layer to form a hole transport layer, and Au electrodes were thermally evaporated to make contacts with the devices. The performance of the device was measured under irradiation with AM 1.5G light at an intensity of 100 W cm−2, with an active device area of 0.09 cm2, using a mask. Fig. 1a shows a cross-sectional colored field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) image of a device with a SiO2 scaffold layer. Fig. 1b–f show magnified images of the scaffold layer regions in order to investigate the infiltration of perovskite into the SiO2 scaffold layer. A compact layer, 80 ± 5 nm thick, containing 15 to 20 nm diameter TiO2 NPs was located under the SiO2 scaffold layer. The thickness of the SiO2 NP scaffold layer was 230 ± 30 nm. Fig. 1b and c show that perovskite did not infiltrate deeply into the mesoporous layer containing the 15 and 30 nm diameter SiO2 NPs; however, the scaffold layers formed of larger silica NPs (i.e., 50, 70, and 100 nm diameter) exhibited good infiltration of perovskite into the spaces between the SiO2 NPs. Fig. 1d–f show holes that originated from some of the SiO2 NPs leaving the matrix of the mesoporous scaffold layer, indicating that the pore size between the SiO2 NPs with a diameter of 50 nm or larger was sufficient for perovskite to infiltrate into the scaffold layer. Furthermore, perovskite appeared to be in contact with the compact TiO2 layer. The penetration of perovskite was also investigated using elemental line mapping of the SiO2 NPs with diameters of 15 and 100 nm using energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) (see Fig. S1†). The elements Pb and I were deeply infiltrated into the scaffold layer formed of 100 nm diameter SiO2 NPs, but not that formed of 15 nm diameter SiO2 NPs. Based on these data, we can conclude that the pore size between SiO2 NPs strongly influenced the penetration of perovskite into the scaffold layer.

To investigate the absorption of perovskite loaded on the mesoporous layer composed of SiO2 NPs, the absorption of perovskite was measured using ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy. The crystallinity of the perovskite layer on the 50 nm diameter SiO2 NPs was analyzed using X-ray diffraction (XRD) (see Fig. S2†). Interestingly, the optical absorption of the perovskite film increased with the diameter of the silica NPs up to 50 nm, as shown in Fig. 2. This is consistent with the data shown in Fig. 1. It appears that the pore size formed between the SiO2 NPs with diameters of 15 and 30 nm was too small for perovskite to infiltrate into the scaffold layer.

Devices formed from scaffold layers with SiO2 NPs that were 15 and 30 nm in diameter are expected to exhibit relatively small optical absorption. However, devices formed using the scaffold layers with SiO2 NPs with a diameter of 50 nm or greater can be expected to exhibit much higher optical absorption. The infiltration of perovskite into the scaffold layer is illustrated in Fig. 2b. In the case of SiO2 NP with sizes of 15 and 30 nm, perovskite cannot infiltrate into the bottom of the scaffold layer, while perovskite well penetrates into the scaffold layer comprised of SiO2 NPs with sizes of 50, 70, and 100 nm due to the large pore size between SiO2 NPs. Therefore, the optical absorption of the perovskite film composed of SiO2 NPs with a diameter of 50 nm or greater is much stronger than that of 15 and 30 nm. Interestingly, the absorption of the device with a scaffold layer formed of 100 nm diameter SiO2 NPs increased at long wavelengths, which may be related to complex optical scattering effects of the SiO2 NPs or the perovskite structure. Diffuse reflection spectroscopy (DRS) measurements were carried out to investigate the optical scattering effects with various diameter SiO2 NPs; none was observed (data not shown). The perovskite structure formed on the SiO2 NP scaffold layers was also investigated using SEM. The domain size of perovskite increased with the diameter of the SiO2 NPs in the mesoporous layer. The domain size of perovskite deposited on 15 nm diameter SiO2 was ∼20 μm, whereas the domain size for the 100 nm diameter SiO2 NPs was greater than 100 μm (see Fig. S3†). Conings et al. reported similar phenomena of perovskite scattering behavior related to the morphology of the perovskite layer.19 The absorption of needle-like perovskite partly decreased the absorption at short wavelengths and increased the absorption at long wavelengths due to the complex scattering behavior. Considering these results, we expect that the morphology and optical absorption of the perovskite film will be affected by the size of the SiO2 NPs.
We fabricated solar cells to investigate the influence of the scaffold layer on the device performance. The thickness of the scaffold layer was maintained constant, as were all other variables, while the diameter of the SiO2 NPs in the scaffold layer was varied. Fig. 3 shows the short-circuit photocurrent Jsc, open-circuit voltage Voc, fill factor FF, and the PCE. Jsc clearly increased with the diameter of the SiO2 NPs up to 50 nm, and then decreased slightly as the diameter increased beyond 50 nm. Based on the UV-vis absorption spectra, the absorption of the perovskite film decreased because the perovskite loading was small for SiO2 NPs with a diameter less than 50 nm, but complex scattering effects occurred as the diameter of the SiO2 NPs increased above 50 nm. Voc exhibited similar behavior to Jsc as a function of the diameter of the SiO2 NPs. The FF was small in the devices based on the 15 and 30 nm diameter SiO2 NPs, which suggests that both the series shunt resistances increased due to less perovskite infiltration into the scaffold layer, resulting in insufficient electron transfer into the compact TiO2 layer.

The performance metrics shown in Fig. 3 were optimal for the devices formed using scaffold layers composed of 50 nm diameter SiO2 NPs. The amount of perovskite loading on the scaffold layer had the most significant effect on the performance of the perovskite solar cell, but the morphology was also important.

Fig. 4 shows a schematic diagram illustrating the energy levels of the conduction and valence bands in TiO2, SiO2, and perovskite. Importantly, the conduction band energy of TiO2 is lower than that of perovskite, whereas the conduction band energy of SiO2 is higher than that of perovskite. The amorphous SiO2 NPs are insulators with a wide band gap of approximately 9–11 eV.32,33 When a photon is absorbed in the perovskite layer, in the devices with a scaffold layer formed of TiO2 NPs, the photo-generated electron may transfer from perovskite to TiO2; however, in the devices with a scaffold layer formed of SiO2 NPs, electrons cannot transfer to the SiO2 NPs. For this reason, TiO2 forms an electron transport layer in devices with TiO2-based scaffolds, whereas perovskite forms an electron-transport layer in devices with SiO2-based scaffolds. In both devices, photo-generated holes may transfer from the valence band of perovskite into spiro-OMeTAD, which forms the hole-transport layer. In this respect, the behavior of SiO2 is similar to that of Al2O3 and ZrO2 NPs, as has been reported previously.22,29

The capacitance of solar cells containing TiO2 and SiO2 NPs was investigated without illumination. Fig. 5a shows the capacitance of perovskite solar cells as a function of the applied voltage. The bias dependence of the capacitance of both the TiO2- and SiO2-based perovskite solar cells exhibited similar trends, whereas the capacitance increased as a function of the applied bias Vapp. At low applied biases (i.e., Vapp < 0.6 V), similar behavior was observed for both perovskite solar cells. At larger biases (i.e., Vapp > 0.6 V), the capacitance increased exponentially, and the capacitance of the SiO2-based solar cells was lower than that of the TiO2-based devices. Kim et al. reported that at biases greater than approximately 0.6 to 0.7 V, the capacitance of ZrO2-based perovskite solar cells increased exponentially because of charge accumulation in the compact TiO2 layer and perovskite, but not in ZrO2. Furthermore, the capacitance of the TiO2 electrode is greater than that of the ZrO2 electrode due to the larger volume of TiO2 compared with the ZrO2 electrode.34 The SiO2-based perovskite solar cells have a similar configuration to the ZrO2-based perovskite solar cells described in ref. 32. Thus, the SiO2-based devices reported here appear to exhibit a similar bias dependence of the capacitance.

The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of perovskite solar cells with TiO2 and SiO2 scaffold layers were measured using a mask under illumination with an AM 1.5G light source with a power density of 100 W cm−2. The thickness of the scaffold layer containing TiO2 and SiO2 was 230 ± 30 nm. In Fig. 6, the perovskite solar cells with a TiO2 scaffold layer exhibited Jsc = 17.3 mA cm−2, which is larger than the current density of the perovskite solar cells with a SiO2 scaffold layer, where Jsc = 16.4 mA cm−2. The larger current density may result from the difference in the conduction band energy of TiO2 and SiO2. The conduction band energy of TiO2 is lower than that of perovskite, resulting in electron transfer from perovskite into TiO2. Suarez et al. demonstrated that the recombination rate of TiO2 and Al2O3 plays an important role in the open-circuit voltage, Voc.35 Kim et al. also reported that the charge-carrier recombination rate of TiO2 is significantly lower than that of Al2O3 films.23 The lower charge-carrier recombination rate is related to the larger Voc, which may explain the larger Voc in the TiO2-based solar cells compared with the SiO2-based devices. In addition, the TiO2- and SiO2-based perovskite solar cells have different operating principles. When light is absorbed in the TiO2-based perovskite solar cells, photogenerated electrons transfer into TiO2. In contrast, in the SiO2-based devices, photogenerated electrons remain in perovskite. It has an effect on Voc. To further investigate the electron injection into TiO2 and SiO2 NPs, we measured the photoluminescence (PL) as shown in Fig. S4.† The PL quantum yield of the TiO2/perovskite solar cell is greatly reduced compared with the SiO2/perovskite solar cell. It is considered that the photogenerated electrons in perovskite are quenched by electron injection into TiO2. As a result, the open-circuit voltage is higher, 10.5 V for the SiO2-based devices compared with 0.94 V for the TiO2-based devices. The PCE of the SiO2-based solar cell was 11.45%, whereas that of the TiO2-based device was 10.29%.

Conclusions
We have described the use of size-controlled SiO2 NPs as a scaffold layer in perovskite-based solar cells. The size of the pores formed between SiO2 NPs depended on the diameter of the NPs, and this was found to affect the infiltration of perovskite into the scaffold layer. SiO2 NPs with a diameter of 50 nm resulted in efficient infiltration of perovskite while maintaining favorable optical properties, resulting in optimum performance of the solar cells. Furthermore, both SiO2-based and TiO2-based perovskite solar cells exhibited a similar bias dependence of the capacitance. The open-circuit voltage of the SiO2-based solar cells was larger than that of the TiO2-based devices, which led to a higher PCE of 11.45% for the SiO2-based solar cells, compared with 10.29% for the TiO2-based solar cells.
