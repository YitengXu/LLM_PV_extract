The devices show significantly increased performance with power conversion efficiencies up to 9.51%. It is noteworthy that the results here provide significant scientific insights into further improvement of interfacial modification and performance of polymer solar cells.
Introduction
Bulk hetero-junction polymer solar cells (PSCs) based on conjugated polymers and fullerene derivatives are attracting extensive interest due to their advantages of ease of large-scale fabrication, low cost, light weight and flexibility.1–4 Over the past decades, the efficiency of PSCs has been steadily improved up to 10–11% with great efforts in material design, device structure and interface engineering.5–7
In hetero-junction PSCs, the realization of photoelectric conversion includes the absorption of active-layer materials, the formation, separation and transport of excitons in active-layer materials, and charge collection in electrodes. Obviously, active-layer materials are considered to be important to obtain highly efficient PSCs. In this regard, there are much relative research work focusing on the design and synthesis of high performance active-layer materials, including polymers as donors8–12 and fullerene derivatives as acceptors.13–15 Recently, some significant advances based on these novel active layer materials have been reported with the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) up to 11.5%,7 which is above the 10% threshold for commercial applications. Besides active layer materials, the electron collection ability is also thought to be another important factor for obtaining highly efficient PSCs. Generally, the effective method is to choose suitable electrodes with a matched work function, which will benefit the collection and extraction of charge.16 However, the emerging endless active-layer materials with different levels cannot readily find suitable electrodes. In view of this, some researchers have put forward the idea of insertion of an interfacial layer to increase the collection ability of electrons and holes between the active-layer materials and electrodes. Therefore, the studies about interfacial materials are attracting extensive attention, especially the cathode interface.17–19 Several classes of interfacial materials have proven effective in improving the electron extraction properties of PSCs, including metals or metallic salts such as Ca, Mg, Cs2CO3,20 CsF,21 titanium chelates22 and so on for cathode interfaces. However, those metals or metallic salts usually demand vacuum deposition, limiting their application in low-cost and large area PSCs.
Alternatively, water-/alcohol-soluble organic interface materials are applied widely for PSCs largely due to their solution process and effective cathode modification properties. The general design of these organic (polymeric and small molecular) interface materials requires the introduction of specific functional groups (such as phosphonate,23 ethylene oxide,24 amino or ammonium,25etc.) that can form the desired interfacial dipole with the electrode of aluminum (Al), thus changing the work function of Al and significantly improving the charge collection efficiency. Recently, there have been plenty of publications using polymer or small molecule interface materials to regulate the charge collection ability of the electrode, and most of them exhibit excellent performance with PCE up to 9%.26–29 Notably, all/most of the reported interfacial materials contain various conjugated units to improve their electronic conductivity, which limits their commercial application in low-cost and large area fabrication due to the complicated preparation. Regarding the commercial application of PSCs, the low cost deserves more attention compared to the efficiency now. Hence, interfacial materials with simple structures, such as non-conjugated small molecules which exhibit good interfacial modification and improvement in electron transport and collection, are more promising candidates in PSCs. Recently, our group reported a series of novel non-conjugated interfacial materials, which exhibited good interfacial modification and made great enhancement in photocurrent, leading to the rise of PCE up to 10% for the novel interlayer-based single junction PSCs.30,31 However, the non-conjugated small-molecule zwitterion for highly efficient PSCs still has fewer reports.
Here, we proposed an even more simple non-conjugated small-molecule zwitterion as the cathode interface, which contains an oxygen atom as the core connected with dipodal alkyl side chains functionalized with sulfonate end groups. The novel non-conjugated small-molecule zwitterion, 4,4′-((oxybis(ethane-2,1-diyl))bis(dimethyl-ammoniumdiyl))bis(butane-1-sulfonate) (designated as OEABS), is used as an interfacial layer for PSCs, along with the active-layer materials of poly[[4,8-bis[(2-ethylhexyl)oxy]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl][3-fluoro-2-[(2-ethylhexyl)carbonyl]thieno[3,4-b]thiophenediyl]] (PTB7) and PC71BM. The chemical structures of the materials used for device fabrication, device structure, and energy level diagram are shown in Scheme 1. The resulting device with the interfacial layer gives a PCE of 9.51%, which is 19% higher than that of the Ca based device, illustrating an intriguing potential in PSCs instead of vacuum deposited metals or metallic salts, and expensive conjugated interfacial materials.
 Scheme 1  (a) Molecular structure of the device configuration; (b) energy levels of the PSCs; (c) calculated HOMOs and LUMOs of OEABS using the DFT method at the B3LYP-6-31g(d) level. 
The non-conjugated small-molecule zwitterion OEABS was one-step synthesized by quaternization of 2,2′-oxybis(N,N-dimethylethan-1-amine) with 1,4-butanesultone in a THF/methanol solvent. The detailed synthetic procedures and characterization of OEABS are described in the Experimental section and ESI.† OEABS exhibited excellent solubility in polar solvents such as water, methanol and dimethylsulfoxide, while it was hardly soluble in chlorobenzene (CB), which are typically used to process the upper active-layer devices with the method of polar solvent wetting treatment. Notably, the non-conjugated small-molecule interlayer can be easily prepared by recrystallization at exceedingly low cost and fabricated for PSCs by spin coating, exhibiting more promising potential than other conjugated ones which need complicated synthetic procedures such as poly [(9,9-bis(3′-(N,N-dimethylamino)-propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)] (PFN), or metals and metallic salts which need vacuum deposition fabrication.
Results and discussion
The UV-vis absorption and reflection spectra of the single-layer OEABS film, single-layer PC71BM:PTB7 film, and the double-layer film with PC71BM:PTB7 and OEABS, formed by spin-casting from the solutions in chlorobenzene for the PC71BM:PTB7 and methanol/acetic acid (97:3, v/v) for the OEABS, respectively, are shown in Fig. 1a and b. Apparently, the bare OEABS film does not show absorption within the wavelength range from 400 to 800 nm, which indicates the high transparency in this wavelength range. By comparison of PC71BM:PTB7 and double-layer films, we can find that the latter has a slightly higher absorption coefficient than the former, which may be attributed to the redistribution of light intensity in the active layer by the OEABS serving as an optical spacer, and the reabsorption from the reflection of the OEABS layer. The energy levels of OEABS are determined by combining the absorption onset and a low-energy photoelectron spectrometer (Kratos AXIS ULTRADLD). The optical band gap is determined from the absorption onset (Fig. 1c) for OEABS is 5.21 eV. While the corresponding HOMO level is calculated from the low-energy photoelectron spectrometer with the value of 6.78 eV as shown in Fig. 1d. Obviously, the low HOMO level in the OEABS can better confine the excitons in the active layer and minimize the quenching of the excitons at the cathode interface. Meanwhile, the present LUMO level allows it to efficiently extract electrons by the formation of the desired dipole with the Al electrode based on its zwitterion.

The OEABS is used as the cathode interface coated on the active-layer for PSCs with the device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PC71BM:PTB7/OEABS/Al under simulated 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5G illumination. For comparison, PSCs with the device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PC71BM:PTB7/Ca/Al were also fabricated. The I–V curves are displayed in Fig. 2a and the performance parameters are tabulated in Table 1. For the devices, the use of OEABS as the cathode interface layer gives remarkably enhanced performance relative to that of Ca. Obviously, by optimizing the thickness of OEABS from 16 nm to 5 nm (Fig. 2b), the highest PCE was achieved when the thickness of OEABS was 7 nm, which is up to 9.51% with JSC = 17.80 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.75 V, and FF = 71.23%. Besides, the photovoltaic performance of devices based on different concentrations of OEABS is also displayed in Fig. S2.† The contrasting devices using Ca/Al as the electrode by using methanol treatment showed one of the highest PCEs of 7.99%, with JSC = 14.92 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.76 V, and FF = 70.47%, and it was comparable to other reported results.32,33 By introducing an OEABS interlayer between the active-layer and Al electrode, an improvement of the JSC (17.80 mA cm−2vs. 14.92 mA cm−2) was obtained, while VOC remains nearly the same, resulting in a drastic improvement of PCE by 19.1% (9.51% vs. 7.99%) over the devices with the Ca/Al electrode. We can conclude that the high device performance is mainly attributed to the OEABS interlayer. The devices showed a high JSC value, indicating the enhancement of electron transport and confinement of current leakage by effective cathode interfacial modification of this non-conjugated small-molecule zwitterion OEABS. The different intensities of illumination were also tested as shown in Fig. 2c, demonstrating that the results are dependent on the intensities of illumination. Simultaneously, a similar improved performance is also observed by using it as the interlayer for P3HT and PC71BM as shown in Table 1.

Without encapsulation, the devices were sent to the National Center of Supervision and Inspection on Solar Photovoltaic Products Quality of China (CPVT) for certification. A certified PCE of 9.022% was obtained (Table 1, Fig. S3†). This result is 5% lower than that measured in our lab, which can be attributed to unencapsulated devices and the degradation of conventional device architecture exposed in air. The results from CPVT confirmed that the efficiency of our devices is reliable, and that the value is among the highest efficiencies reported to date for conventional single-junction PSCs.
The external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the devices shows an overall enhancement in the entire absorption range when the OEABS layer is used instead of Ca in the cathode (Fig. S4†), which implies that the increase of current density results from more effective electron collection by the OEABS layer than the Ca layer. With the OEABS layer, the EQEs from 450 to 700 nm are in the range of 60–70%, which are much higher than those with the Ca layer (55–65%). The higher EQE in the devices with the OEABS layer is due to the enhanced absorption provided by the reabsorption from the reflection of the OEABS layer. The additional electron collection enhancement can also be manifested by the calculation of series resistance (Rs) and shunt resistance (Rsh) from reciprocals of the slopes of the J–V curves at I = 0 and V = 0. For the devices with the OEABS and Ca layers respectively, a significant rise in Rs from 3.30 to 3.87 Ω cm2, and an obvious drop in Rsh from 872 to 765 Ω cm2 are obtained. The results indicate that the device with the OEABS layer gives a reduced Rs by the promotion of electron conductivity at the interface and in the bulk of the cathode.
At the OEABS–Al interface, the electron mobility would allow an improvement relative to Ca/Al or LiF/Al devices as expected. The electron mobility (μe) was investigated across the film by applying single-carrier space charge limited conduction (SCLC) on the electron-only device ITO/Al/PC71BM:PTB7/OEABS or Ca/Al, and the results are displayed in Fig. 2d and Table S1.† The electron mobility of the OEABS/Al device with different thicknesses of OEABS is notably higher than that of Ca/Al devices, especially with a thickness of 5 nm. The value is 4.38 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is 75 times larger than that of Ca/Al devices.
In order to understand the effects of the OEABS layer on photovoltaic performance, we then carried out a morphology study of the active layer with and without the OEABS layer. It is well-known that a nanoscale phase separation and bicontinuous interpenetrating network in the active layer is necessary to efficiently separate the exciton and form percolating channels for the transport of both holes and electrons. The surface morphology of the films with and without the OEABS layer was characterized using tapping-mode atomic force microscopy (AFM). Surface topography and phase images were taken for both films as shown in Fig. 3. Both of the films are smooth and uniform, which is critical to minimize current leakage. The root-mean-square (rms) roughness of the film with the OEABS layer is 1.44 nm, very close to that of the film without OEABS (1.52 nm). In comparison, the height images of the films with the OEABS layer show much more clear nano-fibrillar features. Because the phase contrast is related to the difference in adhesive and mechanical properties of individual materials, the dark and bright parts in phase images can be differentiated as different components. Nanoscale phase separation and a bicontinuous interpenetrating network can be clearly observed. Additionally, the Kelvin probe force microscopy measurements were used to image the surface potential changes. As shown in Fig. S5,† by introducing the OEABS layer between the electrode and active-layer, the average surface potential of the composite film increases. These observations are in agreement with the idea of local dipole arrangements that modify the contacts with the Al electrode.

To clearly demonstrate the electron collection in the PSCs with and without the OEABS layer, we developed a model (in Scheme 1a) to address this point about the important role of non-conjugated interfaces in PSCs. When the active-layer was excited and the carriers transported to the interfaces of cathodes and anodes, the anions in the OEABS with a negatively charged –SO3− functional group are placed near the photoactive layer, while the cations with the positively charged amine functional group are applied as the outermost layer of the active-layer and distributed near the electron rich area at the Al electrode interface. When the active-layer is excited by sunlight, the formed excitons are separated and transported to the interface of cathodes and anodes as shown in Scheme 1a. For the OEABS interface, the spontaneous orientation from the ionic group of OEABS and its corresponding counterion leads to the formation of permanent dipoles between the active layer and Al electrode, which is beneficial to the electron extraction from the active layer to the Al electrode. For the corresponding Ca/Al PSCs devices, the electron from the active layer moves to the interface between Ca and the active layer, the electron can be transported to the Ca layer driven by the ohmic contact. While the permanent dipoles can only be realized in the OEABS modified cathode interface, the ability of electron extraction and collection in Ca/Al PSCs is weaker than that of OEABS based PSCs. Obviously, by using an OEABS interfacial layer, we can achieve a precise charge distribution and surface polarization at the interfaces of the active layer, interfacial layer and electrode.
Conclusions
In conclusion, we have presented a cheap non-conjugated small-molecule zwitterion as a cathode interface material to enhance the electron transfer and collection properties of high-performance PSCs. The novel non-conjugated small-molecule zwitterion offers the properties necessary for an efficient interface material including effective work function modification of the Al electrode, good electron selectivity, transport and collection properties, low optical absorption, good film formation, and orthogonal solution processability. Based on these excellent properties of interface materials, the PSCs with OEABS exhibited an encouraging PCE value of 9.51%, which is improved by about 19% compared to that obtained by using the calcium (Ca) cathode. The new interface material offers an even more appealing feature in its ability to achieve good device performance at low cost.
