    , Accepted 13th February 2021First published on 24th February 2021AbstractBio-inspired electronic devices have significant potential for use in memory devices of the future, including in the context of neuromorphic computing and architecture. This study proposes a transparent heterojunction device for the artificial human visual cortex. Owing to their high transparency, such devices directly react to incoming light to mimic neurological and biological processes in the nervous system. Metal–oxide materials are applied to form a transparent heterojunction (n-type ZnO/p-type NiO) in the proposed device that also provides the photovoltaic function to realize the optic nerve system. The device also exhibits nociceptive features. Its transparent photovoltaic feature endows it with self-powered operation that ensures long-term reliability without needing to replace the power system. This self-powered and highly transparent visual electronic device can provide a route for sustainable applications of neuromorphic computing, including artificial eyes.
Introduction
The rapid evolution of electronic devices that can mimic brain-like functionalities has led to significant growth in neuromorphic technology in recent years.1,2 It is an emerging field of research that focuses on developing artificial neurobiotics. In developing such systems, the primary concerns include the availability of the requisite materials, a simple device structure, and low computational power.3 Earth-abundant materials with photonic properties have been extensively researched for the implementation of artificial neurosystems.3 Owing to their photovoltaic feature, these neuronal architectures will lead to the development of self-driven electronics and, in turn, to energy sustainability.4
Metal oxides are among the easily accessible materials that are widely known for such useful properties as a wide bandgap, large exciton binding energy, non-stoichiometric structure, and high stability.5,6 Owing to their high bandgap energy, metal oxide-based heterostructures can absorb short-wavelength ultraviolet radiation (UV) and allow visible light to pass through. The absorbed UV radiation can be harnessed to generate electrical energy while visible light transmittance would reflect the transparent feature in the solar cell operation mode. The latter property has been shown in transparent solar cells to generate electric power. However, metal oxide-based self-driven neuromorphic devices have been rarely reported.7,8
With the growing concern for energy sustainability, it is important for a device to have a self-operating function independent of an external motive force that can help optimize energy. This study proposes a self-operational transparent neuromorphic device fabricated by a metal oxide heterojunction where the device exhibits neuromorphic features of human neural system including photoreceptors and nociceptors which are responsible for the detection of visual signals and for the sensing of harmful external stimulus in order to prevent any damage to human body.7 The self-powered device, for example p–n junction, bulk photovoltaic, piezoelectricity and flexoelectricity, can release the system from the external power supply.3 Such systems can be recognized by the self-sustainable architecture of the device with memory and neuromorphic features. Owing to its large energy bandgap, the n-type ZnO/p-type NiO heterojunction is optically transparent. Moreover, it spontaneously establishes an electric field between the n-ZnO and the p-NiO layers to simultaneously produce electric energy from the incident light for a transparent photovoltaic (TPV) device. This transparent photovoltaic nature of the device is analogous to optic nerve system of human eye. The optic nerve, known as cranial nerve II, is a paired nerve that connects the retina and visual cortex and is responsible for transmitting visual information, in the electric form, from the retina to the brain.9,10 The device shows neuromorphic features under zero bias, which verifies its self-operation mode.
The resistive switching (RS) memory is usually induced by a change in resistance from high to low, or vice versa.5,11 Unlike the conventional dependence on an external bias, TPV may provide the shift in resistive state by responding to the incident light. By active utilization, the TPV device can detect the photonic signal to mimic the function of the human eye, and thus can serve as a photoreceptor, as shown in Fig. 1(a). When receiving light as an extreme stimulus, the nervous system reacts quickly to remove or reduce damage and protect the body, which is a function of the nociceptor as shown in Fig. 1(b). Similarly, the TPV photodetector serves as a nociceptor. Considering the negative effects of solar UV light, such as skin diseases and damage to the eye, the fabrication of artificial nociceptors enables the detection of these harmful signals and provides a corresponding response to prevent damage. Moreover, it broadens the applicability of such systems to areas like healthcare, sports, and the military. Our device manifests highly sensitive nociceptive behavior. It responds instinctively to even low-intensity illumination. Moreover, in light of its memristive and resistive switching attributes, it is clear that the device also has memory-related functions.

Here, a multifunctional ZnO/NiO-based transparent photovoltaic device is realized which is fabricated using large-scale sputtering technique on a glass substrate. The self-operational photoreceptive device exhibits memory-related and neuromorphic features with high performance-related parameters. This work shows that the ZnO/NiO heterostructure can play a vital role in the development of high speed artificial photoreceptors and memory systems.
Results and discussion
Optoelectronic characteristics
To examine the TPV properties of the n-ZnO/p-NiO heterostructure, its optoelectronic properties were measured. To observe the TPV layers, a cross-sectional SEM image was obtained as shown in Fig. 2(a). Fluorine-doped tin-oxide (FTO)-coated glass was used as a substrate, and thus the FTO served as a substrate electrode. The n-type ZnO was deposited onto the FTO layer. To form the p/n heterojunction, p-NiO was coated above the ZnO. To ensure the transparency of the TPV device, silver nanowires (AgNWs) were used to form the top electrode. As shown in the SEM image, the AgNWs were connected by networks that allow the incident light to propagate into the p/n heterojunction.6,12,13 Above the AgNWs, a thin ZnO film was coated to form a protective layer for the AgNWs from thermal or bias-induced deformation.14–17 A high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) image of the ZnO/AgNW specimen obtained by the scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) technique showed the intact AgNW uniformly coated by an ultra-thin ZnO film, as shown in Fig. 2(b). This result confirmed that the AgNW had diameter of ∼20 nm and the ZnO overlayer had a thickness of ∼15 nm. Further, the elemental mapping, summarized in Fig. 2(c) and (d), clarified the consistency and distribution of Ag, Zn, and O.

(g) Semi-log scale I–V characteristic plots of the device representing the photodiode properties. 
The TPV device had transparent electrodes on both sides that allowed the propagation of light along two paths. As a result, the device exhibited a high transparency of 60% in the band of visible wavelength (λ, 400 nm < λ < 800 nm), as shown in Fig. 2(e). This high transparency may be useful for visual applications.
To observe the electrical properties of the ZnO/NiO TPV device, its I–V characteristics were obtained in dark and light by using a potentiostat/galvanostat system. As shown in Fig. 2(f), an almost negligible dark current (Idark) was detected. To evaluate the TPV performance of the device, the UV source (λ = 400 nm) was illuminated with an intensity of 10 mW cm−2. As is clearly shown in the figure, photovoltaic self-bias was induced by UV light illumination. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is the ratio of photocurrent to dark current (Iphoto/Idark). A significantly high SNR of 3.95 × 105 was obtained from the TPV device. The open-circuit voltage (Voc) and short-circuit current (Jsc) were measured at 482 mV and 838 μA cm−2, respectively. The overall power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the device reached 1.57%. The TPV parameters are summarized in Table 1. For further investigation, the photodiode characteristics of the device were investigated by obtaining its semi-logarithmic I–V profiles, as presented in Fig. 2(g). The asymmetric I–V behaviors clearly indicated rectifying current flow. From the plots, the diode ideality factor was obtained at 2.45.

Memory-related behavior
To investigate the resistive state behaviors of the device, bias voltage was applied to the top electrode (AgNWs) and the substrate electrode (FTO). The current–voltage profiles were obtained by the cyclic voltammetry method for the positive and negative regions, as shown in Fig. 3(a) and (b), respectively. Each scan produced a different path to form the hysteresis loop, which is the key feature of the memristor.18,19 The consecutive input also changed the peak values.

(a) Pinched Hysteresis loop (fingerprint of memristor), (a) and (b) Conductivity variation of the device with subsequent positive and negative voltage sweeps, (c) represents the set and reset switching characteristics of the device (memory feature), (d) device schematics by oxygen vacancy-induced filament model of ZnO/NiO heterostructure. The oxygen vacancies filled by electrons form the filament connection for LRS (left) as the resistive switching mechanism by forward bias condition. For reverse bias, the filament is not formed for HRS (right). The black arrows in the schematic show the current flow direction. (e) Device conductivity variation with a varying amplitude of applied positive pulses. 
The voltage was swept for the positive region scan, with a cycle of 0 V → 5 V → 0 V. The first voltage sweep induced a current of 3.8 mA. The current was strongly proportional to the number of iterations of scanning in the sense that with each cycle there is continuous rise in the peak current value, and the fifth cycle yielded the peak current value of 9.8 mA. The voltage was swept for the negative region scan as well with a cycle of 0 V → −5 → 0 V, and confirmed the step-wise functionality of the device where it maintains multiple resistance states. This clearly suggests that the TPV device can serve multiple “on” states by having different peak current levels (states) that strongly induce a significant extension of the states of memory and space.
Moreover, the TPV device exhibited bi-directional memory (bipolar switching behaviors): consecutive voltage scans were performed for the positive and negative regions, as shown in Fig. 3(c). The voltage sweep cycle was 0 V → 1.5 V → 0 V → −1.5 V. The current output was initially low (high-resistance state, HRS), and the current shifted to a high value to form the low-resistance state (LRS-positive region) and remark the SET state i.e. resistance switching from HRS to LRS. By reducing the voltage, the current was reduced, and reached 0 A at 0 V. By taking the negative voltage, the current increased to a high negative value (LRS-negative region), turned into the HRS, and returned to 0 A at 0 V. The TPV trail of voltage produced positive high-level current (first “on” state) and negative high-level current (second “on” state). The benefit of the two levels of “on” states was to easily access and erase the memory by returning to the “off” state (zero current) as the two states serve as memory storage while off state corresponds to zero storage or empty memory. This implies multilevel “on” states for data storage.20
The learning process is an essential feature of artificial synapses (or the nerve system) based on neuromorphic electronics. To investigate its learning capability (memorizing function),21–23 pulsed input signals were applied to the TPV device (Fig. S1†), and the output current appeared to show its retention-related feature. This is similar to the synaptic plasticity to shift the synaptic weight reacting to the input signal, which can induce synaptic memory storage.24
The resistive switching (RS) phenomenon in metal oxides is generally attributed to lattice imperfections, also called defects. For example, in ZnO, these defects mainly comprise vacancies that are actually empty spaces in the lattice owing to missing atoms, interstitials where spare atoms occupy regular lattice spaces, and antisites where Zn atoms occupy the position of oxygen, or vice versa.25 Of them, oxygen vacancies are thought to be responsible for the RS effect in metal oxides.26,27 Oxygen vacancies are depicted as trapping and de-trapping centers in the matrix of the metal oxide, leading to a significant shift in resistance with the applied positive and negative pulses.7,25,28 NiO also consists of defect states of nickel and oxygen, but in this study, the layer of NiO used was thin, because of which the main contribution to the working mechanism was made by ZnO. It had a layer of sufficient thickness.29
The RS mechanism in the ZnO/NiO device is now discussed. Initially, the device is in a high-resistance state (HRS) due to the formation of the barrier between n-ZnO and p-NiO in the equilibrium condition, and hence the trapping sites are empty. When a small positive bias is applied to the device, electrons from the FTO of the bottom electrode are trapped in the oxygen vacancies in the ZnO film and the NiO/ZnO barrier (as the width of the barrier is not significantly affected, owing to the small bias potential). However, until a SET voltage is reached, all the trapped states are filled, and the width of the barrier decreases significantly to lead to a built-in potential reduction. This abruptly causes the resistance of the device to switch from HRS to the low-resistance state (LRS), and a sharp rise in current can be observed as shown in Fig. 3(c). On the contrary, when a negative sweeping voltage is applied to the device, the trapped electrons are subjected to an attractive force from the bottom electrode. As soon as the RESET voltage is reached, all the trapped electrons eventually start to move toward the bottom electrode, and the width of the barrier between p-NiO and n-ZnO simultaneously increases due to an increase in the built-in potential, which in turn switches the LRS of the device to HRS. The device exhibited a low resistance state by the forward bias and a high resistance state by the reverse bias, as presented in Fig. 3(d). For clarity, we also added the schematic diagram representing the oxygen-vacancy-filamentary model for the LRS and HRS mechanism.30–32 The working mechanism of the device is illustrated in Fig. 3(d). Moreover, to reflect the stability of the device, it was tested under the cyclic voltammetry technique for 10 consecutive cycles. It is clear from Fig. S2† that the ZnO/NiO device remained relatively stable after the sweeping cycles. Further, its conductivity also reflected a dependence on the amplitude of applied voltage pulses, as shown in Fig. 3(e). It is clear that higher current values were obtained for voltage pulses with higher amplitudes.
Receptive and nociceptive characteristics
The presence of oxygen-trapped states in ZnO provides an opportunity to examine the characteristics of the device under photon illumination, as the vacancies can also be filled by photo-generated charge carriers (depicted in Fig. 4(a)). Initially, the device was studied for varying intensity of UV radiation and the corresponding photoresponse was recorded. For UV radiation of 2 mW cm−2, a photocurrent of 30 μA, three times higher than that for a light intensity of 0.5 mW cm−2, was observed as shown in Fig. S3.† The magnified image of the output pulse is highlighted in Fig. 4(b), from which it is clear how the output response varied during the on and off conditions of the UV light source. Our results shown in Fig. 4(c) indicate that the device could sense the range of photon flux, and this resembles the behavior of receptors in the human eye. It also maintained a constant photoresponse over time, which clearly highlights the device's stability as a photoreceptor (Fig. S3†). These receptors received the optical signals via the eye, responded to photon wavelengths and intensities, and correspondingly generated responses through the brain.33 To further highlight the photoresponse of the device, its transient characteristics with varying light intensity are shown in Fig. 4(d). This observation illustrates that it is a highly sensitive light receptor under UV light irradiation with a tunable feature.

(a) Device working mechanism illustration for the light condition in terms of filled and not filled oxygen vacancies, (b) photocurrent as a function of UV light @ 0 V, 20 Hz, (c) represents the receptive behavior of device by showing the variation of photocurrent with UV light intensity (d) transient behavior of device showing the variation of Iphoto, Ipyro and Ipyro+photo with varying UV light intensity. 
In addition, the device behaved like a nociceptor by showing its most prominent properties, such as no adaptation, threshold, and saturation.8 Its photoresponse increased with time for incoming UV radiation (2 mW cm−2) and then saturated, as shown in Fig. S4.† No further change in photocurrent was observed, even though the radiation was continuously applied. This shows that the device does not adapt to harmful incoming signals and maintains a response until the radiation is removed. This feature is similar to “no adaptation” behavior of the nociceptor that shields the body from damaging exterior stimuli. The nature of the saturation can be explained based on the equilibrium condition developed between the trapping states and the generated charge carriers. This helped retain a certain photocurrent value across the device irrespective of the applied train of UV light pulses. The device behaved like a nociceptor at −0.1 V of bias, which is available by the device's self-powered feature where it absorbs high energy UV photons and converts them into electrical power.
We also confirmed that the device produced greater photocurrent for an optical signal with high intensity due to the proportional relationship of photon flux and photogenerated carriers, which gives rise the random filling of the trapped states, as shown in Fig. S5.†7 This shows that with an increase in the strength of damaging stimuli i.e. increase in the strength of the light intensity above 0.5 mW cm−2, the device generates greater photo current as a sign of awareness that the incoming UV light is harmful to prevent it. This is precisely how nociceptors behave, they increase the amount of pain when the strength of external stimulus crosses the threshold so that it can prevent the human body from serious damage. Moreover, the device's response time was also fast (tth = 20 ms), and was independent of the intensity of the incoming radiation (Fig. S6 and S7†). Even for a low-intensity signal, the device generated photocurrent within the same time duration as for a high-intensity signal. Irrespective of the nociceptor's normal threshold condition, in which the response time decreased with the increasing strength of the stimuli, the device had a fixed threshold for a response speed of 20 ms, and behaved like a high-speed sensitive nociceptor.
The performance of the device was also compared with previously reported memristors and nociceptors, with the comparison made based on the nociceptor response time (tth), turn-on voltage (VSET), hyperalgesia output (Imax) (S8†), receptive response, and device specifications. As is illustrated in Table 2, at the maximum hyperalgesia output, the response speed of our device was fast. It also exhibited multiple features, making it suitable for use in self-powered neuromorphic devices. Overall, the results here can contribute to the development of a simply structured transparent neuromorphic device with a storage feature.

Experimental section
Fabrication
Initially, FTO (fluorine-doped tin oxide)-coated glass substrates were ultrasonically cleaned for 10 min by using a series of chemicals, including acetone, methanol, and distilled water. They were then dried by passing nitrogen gas through them. By using a large-scale sputtering technique, thin films of ZnO and NiO layers were deposited. For NiO film deposition, the reactive sputtering of the Ni target was used at a flow rate of Ar/O2 of 20/5 sccm and 50 W of power for a growth rate of 2.5 nm min−1. Further, the RF magnetron sputtering of the ZnO (iTasco, purity 99.99%) target was used to fabricate zinc oxide films. The flow rate of Ar gas was kept at 50 sccm at a power of 300 W, which resulted in a film growth rate of 6.66 nm min−1. The fabrications were carried out at room temperature with a working pressure of 5 mTorr and a base pressure of 2 × 10−6 Torr. The AgNW layer was deposited by using spin-coating of AgNW ink purchased from Nanopyrix, South Korea, to realize a transparent photovoltaic device. The spin-coated films were then dried at 100 °C for 1 min using a hot plate.
Characterization
A field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, JEOL, JSM_7001F) was deployed to acquire the cross-sectional and topographical images of the device. The structural characteristics of the specimens were determined by a thermal field emission transmittance electron microscope (FETEM, FEI, TALOS F200X) using high-angle annular dark-field imaging (HAADF) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The AgNW/ZnO structure was dispersed on Cu grid-carbon using isopropyl alcohol and dried under a nitrogen stream. To capture the absorbance and transmittance spectra of the device in the range of wavelengths of 300–1400 nm, a UV-visible diffused reflectance spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, UV-2600) was used. A potentiostat/galvanostat (PGStat, ZIVE SP2, WonA Tech.) was used to record the current–voltage characteristics of the device. By using the linear sweep voltammetry technique at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1, the performance of the device was observed under dark and light conditions. Its ideality factor was calculated by using the relation, (q/kT) × (dV/d(lnI)), where (kT/q) is thermal potential, in mV. To calibrate the light source with visible wavelength, a light power meter (KUSAM, MECO KM-SPM-11) was used.
Conclusions
We proposed transparent solar cells here based on the ZnO/NiO heterostructure that exhibited sustainable neuromorphic computing features. These features include self-operation, transparency, photovoltaics, photodetection, and memristive and neuromorphic operations. The device exhibited remarkable performance in terms of IHRS, nociceptor response time, and hyperalgesia photocurrent response. Moreover, its hyperalgesia feature shows that the device can discern between harmful and innocuous stimuli, and can generate according reactions. No device with such a simple architecture and the properties described above might has been showcased till now with all the features above in just a single one. Further neuromorphic features of the device can be studied and compared on flexible substrates as flexible photodetectors developed with the same architecture reported high performance device.34 Our study paves the way for self-powered see-through neuromorphic applications with non-volatile memory.
