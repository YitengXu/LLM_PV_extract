    , Accepted 6th July 2022First published on 19th July 2022AbstractMerging solar energy conversion and storage into a single device would improve the utilization of solar energy. Within such a device, the photoelectrochemical material is crucially important. Herein, we design a hybrid perovskite (DAPbI) that exhibits the favorable properties of fast charge transfer and CO redox sites for steady and reversible Li+ de/intercalation, and it can be used as a bifunctional cathode for an efficient photoinduced lithium-ion battery (LIB). The enhanced charge carrier lifetime of DAPbI (τCS/CR = 452.1/3905 ps, compared to the organic cation DAAQ where τCS/CR = 335.7/1291 ps) for solar harvesting and conversion and its abundant reversible redox activity for energy storage lay the foundations for efficient photoelectrochemical energy conversion and storage. Using DAPbI as a cathode, an integrated photo-assisted LIB is realized, with a 0.2 V reduction in charge voltage, a 0.1 V increase in discharge voltage, enhancements of 7.4% in roundtrip efficiency and 0.5% in photoelectrochemical energy storage efficiency, and an 11.3% reduction in input power and an 18% increase in output power. This work provides a direct and sustainable strategy to utilize solar energy through electrochemical energy storage, which may support prosperous developments in this domain.
Introduction
Recently, the combined utilization of renewable solar energy and electrochemical energy storage have attracted scientists’ wide interest because of worsening environmental problems.1 Currently, in addition to optimizing the configurations (e.g., from common photovoltaics connecting with external batteries to two-electrode devices) to improve solar energy conversion efficiency,2–4 researchers have also made great efforts to realize the effective utilization of solar energy in the photo-assisted battery system by designing appropriately active electrode materials.5,6 In previous work, the physical and/or chemical strategies adopted for integrating light-absorbing and storage materials were proven accessible for effective solar energy utilization.7–9 For instance, LiFePO4/N719 dye is used as cathode, where LiFePO4 and N719 dye are responsible for energy storage and light capture, respectively.10 A system based on this cathode obtained 15 cycles of light-assisted charging and constant current discharge. However, owing to the energy level mismatch and insufficient contact interfaces between the solar harvesting and storage components, a poor 0.06–0.08% photoelectrochemical (PEC) conversion and poor storage efficiency were gained in this work. On the other hand, designing bifunctional cathode materials that can efficiently serve in both solar energy utilization and energy storage processes are greatly vital.11 V2O5 material is used as a difunctional cathode in LIBs.12 The battery is charged to about 2.82 V under illumination, and the calculated conversion efficiency is ∼0.22% for 1 sun illumination. In view of this, a proper PEC storage material consisting of light-harvesting sites and energy storage material is needed.
As far as we know, their adjustable redox functional groups (such as CO) and molecular structure make organic materials promising candidates for high-efficiency solar-to-electrochemical energy storage.13–15 To date, some organic materials, such as tetrakislawsone (TKL),16 covalent organic framework (COF)17 and porous organic cage embedded C60 guest molecules (C60@POC),18 have been reported for PEC energy storage. Besides, despite quinone-base organic molecules possessing considerable redox activity sites, sterling electrochemical reversibility and lower cost,19 they have the disadvantages of poor conductivity and undesired photogenerated carrier recombination when used as electrode material, which greatly restricts their practical applications.20 Combining quinone-based molecules with a rapid charge-transfer and conductive material is an effective way to solve the above problems.21,22 Due to its long photoexcited carrier lifetime, high mobility, and other attractive optoelectronic properties, halide perovskite is extensively used in solar cells, light-emitting diodes (LEDs), and photodetectors.23,24 Volder's group designed an all-in-one photobattery based on perovskite ((C6H9C2H4NH3)2PbI4) solar cells (PSCs) and Li-ion batteries (LIBs) that can harvest solar energy while conducting Li-ion storage.25 But its overall PEC conversion efficiency is only 0.034%. Furthermore, this configuration is restricted to photo-assisted charging and evades photo-assisted discharging, which greatly hampers its industrialization and commercialization value.
Herein, owing to the tunability of A-site cation, we employ 2,6-diamino anthraquinone (DAAQ) as organic spacer and PbI2 as inorganic layers, and fabricate an organic–inorganic perovskite material (DAPbI) that possesses the functions of solar energy utilization and Li storage simultaneously. Significantly, introducing a large-size organic cation molecule (DAAQ) with redox active sites to insert the inorganic layers (PbI2) retains the inherent optical and electronic properties of lead-based perovskite and endows the merit of reversible Li+ de/intercalation on the other hand. Structural properties obtained based on various characterization methods, along with a series of optical and electrochemical results, demonstrate that DAPbI not only enhances the lithium de/intercalation kinetics but also promotes fast hole generation and transmission processes compared with the organic molecule DAAQ. This paper provides a typical example for the synthesis of high-efficiency PEC energy storage materials in the Li-ion battery system.
Experimental section
Synthesis of perovskite DAPbI
The synthesis of organic-halide perovskite was performed using a sol–gel method.26 Briefly, 2.64 mmol (1.00 g) of lead acetate (Pb(CH3COO)2·3H2O) was introduced to a beaker, then 5 mL HI and a small amount of H3PO2 were added to the lead acetate precursor solution beaker. A clear yellow solution was formed after continuous stirring at room temperature. Subsequently, a certain amount of red 2,6-diamino anthraquinone (DAAQ) powder was added into the PbI2 precursor solution, and yellow precipitate appeared when the reaction temperature was slowly increased to about 80 °C. The heating and stirring were then immediately stopped, and the reaction was cooled to room temperature. Finally, a yellow precipitate was obtained.
Characterization
Powder X-ray diffractometry (PXRD) data were recorded on a Mini Flex II diffractometer (Rigaku). The microscopic morphologies and elementary analysis of the samples were obtained by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (JSM 6700F) with an energy dispersive spectroscopy analyzer. Cryo-TEM was conducted on an FEI Aquilos Cryo-FIB (ThermoFisher, USA). UV-Vis-NIR spectra were performed on a PerkinElmer Lambda-950 UV-Vis spectrometer using BaSO4 as reference. Fluorescence emission spectra were recorded on a FLS920 spectrometer (Edinburgh Instruments, UK).
Electrode preparation and battery fabrication
The electrochemical performance of DAAQ and DAPbI was studied in CR2032 coin cells, which consisted of DAAQ or DAPbI cathode, a Li foil anode and a separator (Celgard 2400). Cathodes were obtained by preparing a slurry containing active material, carbon nanotube, and PVDF in the percentage of 6:3:1 in NMP. Before drying at 60 °C in a vacuum oven for 24 h, the slurry was cast onto SUS 304 stainless steel foil. The active material was loaded on each electrode at a mass of ∼2.0 mg cm−2. 1 M LiTFSI dissolved in a mixture of 1,3-dioxolane (DOL) and 1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME) (1:1 in volume) was used as the electrolyte.
The photoelectrochemical performance of DAAQ and DAPbI was studied in CR2032 coin cells with a hole of 11 mm diameter on the cathode shells, which enabled illumination on the cathode.
Electrochemical and photoelectrochemical measurements
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was done over the frequency range of 0.1 Hz to 1 MHz with an input voltage amplitude of 5 mV. A Xe lamp (PLSSXE300, Perfectlight, China) was used as the light source, and the introduced light power is ∼200 mW cm−2. EIS was recorded on a CHI660e electrochemical workstation (CH Instrument Inc.), and galvanostatic measurements were conducted on a battery test system (LAND-V34, Land Electronic Co., Ltd, Wuhan).
Results and discussion
DAPbI, a two-dimensional (2D) halide perovskite, was synthesized by using a sol–gel method,26 in which 2,6-diamino anthraquinone (DAAQ) was used as organic spacer and PbI2 as the inorganic layers. The schematic structure of DAPbI is shown in Fig. 1a, and the optical images of DAAQ and DAPbI are presented in Fig. S1.† The functional group CO of cation DAAQ is considered as the redox active site for fast delithiation/lithiation to energy storage.27 Meanwhile, the DAPbI material can harvest solar energy. The X-ray diffraction pattern (XRD) in Fig. 1b demonstrates the existence of DAPbI. Moreover, the XRD also proves the high crystallinity of the perovskite. The scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) image (Fig. 1c) reveals a rodlike microscopic morphology of DAPbI. It is reported that such morphology is conducive for charge transfer.28 Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis verifies that the morphology of DAPbI is consistent with that observed in SEM (Fig. 1d).

Surface analysis of DAPbI was conducted by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The C 1s spectrum in Fig. S3a† exhibits three peaks at 284.7, 286.1 and 287.1 eV, assigned to the C–C, C–N and CO bonds of NH3+(C14H4O2)NH3+ in perovskite, respectively. The N 1s spectrum of DAPbI at 401.7 eV also corroborates the existence of NH3+ in DAPbI (Fig. S3b†).29 Note that there is a small peak at 290.0 eV in C 1s, which is ascribed to π–π interaction that can be seen as a feature of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)–lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) transition appearing in DAPbI by exciting photoelectrons.30 The Pb 4f7/2 and 4f5/2 peaks in Fig. S3c† are found at 138.2 and 143.3 eV, respectively. The I 3d spectrum shows two contributions, 618.9 eV and 630.4 eV, belonging to 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 each in Fig. S3d,† which is in good agreement with a previous report.31 Furthermore, the characteristic peaks for Pb 4f and I 3d in DAPbI show an obvious shift toward lower binding energies in comparison with PbI2; by contrast, the N 1s for DAPbI shifts toward a larger binding energy compared with DAAQ, suggesting the existence of intermolecular interactions between DAAQ and PbI2 (Fig. 2).32

Solid-state UV-Vis-NIR absorption spectroscopy of DAPbI shows a wide range of light absorption in the whole ultraviolet region, and a broad band-to-band absorption around 410–650 nm, which is assigned to intermolecular charge transfer. The corresponding Tauc plot unveils a proper optical bandgap of 2.34 eV (Fig. 3a). Solid-state fluorescence (FL) emission spectra further support the intermolecular charge transfer of DAPbI from the excited state. In contrast to the strong peak at around 675 nm, the fluorescence emission spectrum of DAPbI shows a negligible peak at about 575 nm. The results further reveal obviously quenched fluorescence. Effective charge separation is further confirmed by the fluorescence excitation spectrum mentioned above (Fig. 3c). Moreover, the fluorescence lifetime (Fig. 3d) was measured to evaluate charge separation and charge recombination. Compared with the lifetime of DAAQ (τaverage = 578.7 ps), DAPbI shows a longer lifetime (τaverage = 1308.8 ps), faster charge separation (τCS = 335.7 ps) and slower charge recombination (τCR = 1291 ps) (Table 1).33 The significantly enhanced carrier lifetime of DAPbI could be ascribed to its high crystallinity with rodlike morphology. This morphology is more favorable for intermolecular charge transfer and results in suppressed nonradiative recombination.28 Based on the discussion above, it can be inferred that DAPbI can serve as a better-performing material that is beneficial to light absorption, while enhancing solar energy conversion efficiency.

Based on the DAPbI or DAAQ cathode, an integrated Li-ion battery device was assembled to estimate their performance of simultaneous solar-to-electrochemical energy transformation and storage. The photocathodes were housed in CR2032 coin cells with a lucent glass window for illuminating the active materials (Fig. S4†). As illustrated in Fig. 4a, cyclic voltammetry (CV) was adopted to estimate DAPbI's electrochemical performance. The reduction peak at 1.92 V is assigned to two electron transfers of the CO functional group, accompanied by the formation of lithium enolates. Besides, the oxidation peak at ∼2.24 V stems from the re-oxidation of lithium enolate to generate CO. The almost-unchanged redox peaks (1.92/2.24 V) in the CV graph indicates a reversible redox reaction for DAPbI. Subsequently, the PEC performance of DAPbI was also examined by CV under simulated solar irradiation. In addition to the increased current density, a negative shift of oxidation peak (0.05 V) and positive shift of reduction peak (0.03 V) equally manifest the reinforced redox processes of DAPbI and the possibility of solar energy utilization with illumination. Furthermore, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were used to measure interfacial resistance during charge transfer (Fig. 4b). The radius of the Nyquist curve of DAPbI is smaller than DAAQ in darkness, suggesting reduced resistance of interfacial charge transfer and enhanced intrinsic conductivity. More importantly, DAPbI exhibits a significantly decreased resistance under lighting, which is half of DAAQ impedance. This further proves the effective charge transport and rapid reaction kinetics in DAPbI.

(b) Nyquist plots of DAPbI and DAAQ with and without illumination. (c) Charge and (d) discharge curves of DAPbI and DAAQ with and without illumination. The photoresponses during (e) charging and (f) discharging when illumination was switched between “on” and “off”. 
Under dark conditions, the discharge/charge capacity of DAPbI is 76/75 mA h g−1, while DAAQ shows the discharge/charge capacity of 119/140 mA h g−1 (Fig. S5†). Despite exhibiting valuable capacity, however, one-quarter of the starting discharge capacity is maintained after 20 cycles, but the DAPbI structure remained stable after several cycles (Fig. S6†), which accords with a previous report on non-light-rechargeable 3D perovskite batteries.34 Surprisingly, remarkably enhanced discharge/charge performance can be seen under illumination. As illustrated in Fig. 4(c and d), the discharge plateau of DAPbI is raised by 110 mV (2.16–2.05 V), and the charge platform drops by 50 mV (2.18–2.13 V); the corresponding roundtrip efficiency of the solar-electrochemical battery under irradiation increased by 7.4%, which is much higher than that of DAAQ (1.4%). Fig. 4e and f investigate the stability of repeatable and reliable ON–OFF photoresponse of the photosupported battery during charge and discharge processes; the results reveal enhanced stability and satisfactory solar energy storage.
Furthermore, current–voltage (I–V) plots involved in the discharge/charge character were employed to estimate the response of the operating voltage towards induced light under different current densities. As illustrated in Fig. 5a, the DAPbI charge voltage dramatically rises to 2.94 V at 3 mA cm−2 from the initial working voltage of 2.21 V (0.01 mA cm−2) without illumination; on the other hand, the charge voltage of DAPbI stays at 2.66 V at 3 mA cm−2 under light, which is 0.28 V lower than 2.94 V in the absence of light. The corresponding input powers of DAPbI with/without illumination at 3 mA cm−2 are 7.99 and 9.01 mW cm−2 (Fig. 5b), indicating a 11.3% savings of input power and a 0.5% PEC energy storage efficiency (200 mW cm−2 of light intensity), which is superior to recent reports. In terms of discharge process under irradiation, the discharge voltages of DAPbI at each current density are higher than those obtained in the dark conditions, showing a 0.31 V voltage difference at 3 mA cm−2, a 18.3% increase of the output power (5.29/6.26 mW cm−2 in dark/light) and a 0.49% storage efficiency of PEC energy (Fig. 5c and d). Comparatively, the voltage difference of DAPbI between charging and discharging is much higher than that of DAAQ (Fig. S8 and S9†). These PEC results provide strong evidence that accelerated charge transfer, enhanced redox activity, and promoted charge/discharge processes for efficient PEC energy storage can substantially be achieved by perovskite containing carbonyl A-site cations.

Conclusions
In conclusion, this work manifests the feasibility of solar energy utilization and energy storage via employing DAAQ as a perovskite organic spacer. Fast intermolecular charge transfer and powerful redox activity ensure the superior performance of PEC energy storage during photodriven discharge/charge processes. Notably, the photosupported discharge/charge voltage is increased/decreased by 200/100 mV, leading to an additional 7.4% of roundtrip efficiency. The input power was economized by 11.3%, and the output power was augmented by 18.3%. Our work shows that highly photoactive lead halide perovskites can simultaneously store energy and conduct reversible charging/discharging via light absorption. This may provide an encouraging path towards solar-to-electrochemical energy storage strategies using perovskite materials.
