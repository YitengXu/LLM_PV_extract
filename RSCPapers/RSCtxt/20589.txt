    , Accepted 3rd May 2018First published on 3rd May 2018AbstractStabilization of planar tetra-coordinate silicon (ptSi) was achieved in compounds and 2D-layered extended systems, in which single molecular ptSi in C12H8Si captures four additional electrons to maintain a stable planar structure while the extending conjugate interactions are responsible for the stabilization of ptSi in the 2D sheet. Based on the ptSi SiC12 building block, a SiC8 siligraphene 2D sheet was constructed, and each of its ptSi could accommodate six lithium atoms. The electronic and lithium-storage properties of the ptSi 2D network were explored using first-principles calculations and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations. The newly designed 2D SiC8 sheet has high thermal and dynamic stability, good electronic conductivity, strong lithium-storage ability, a large theoretical capacity of 1297 mA h g−1, and facile surface diffusion of Li and Li+. The predicted relatively high average cell voltages from 2.24 to 2.47 V are fairly stable as the lithium content varies. These unique properties of the 2D SiC8 sheet with ptSi make it quite appealing as a novel anode material for high-performance Li-ion batteries (LIBs).
Introduction
Crystalline silicon has long been widely applied in electric and photovoltaic devices. Most recently, silicon solar cells, based on the architecture of interdigitated back contacts and an amorphous silicon/crystalline silicon heterojunction, reached a high photoconversion efficiency of over 26%.1 For a rechargeable lithium-ion battery (LIB), the Si-based materials have also been suggested to be one of the most promising anode candidates with a high theoretical gravimetric capacity of 4200 mA h g−1 and a suitable average discharge voltage of ∼0.4 V.2–5 However, poor cycling stability and a sharp volume change by ∼400% during insertion and extraction of lithium for Si anodes limit their practical applications.3,6–10 In order to alleviate the mechanical degradation of Si anodes, a few Si-based composite materials, such as double-walled silicon nanotubes,11,12 silicon oxide,13 nano-silicon@carbon,14,15 porous silicon@carbon,16etc., have been developed for the high-capacity anodes. In particular, the Si nanoparticles as anode materials exhibit a high reversible capacity of 3083 mA h g−1 and long-term cycling stability.17 For flexible battery applications, new-type soft silicon anodes were developed by coating PVDF nanofibers with Si/Ni, and the newly fabricated flexible and stretchable Si/Ni/PVDF membrane is quite promising for the high capacity flexible anode materials.18
As one of the most widely used green energy sources for portable digital products and electric vehicles (EVs), secondary LIBs have attracted widespread worldwide attention.19 The LIBs must be of low cost and high energy density, and exhibit high safety-in-operation and good performance at both low and high temperatures for high-power and high-energy-density applications. The conventional LIBs include negative and positive electrodes, electrolytes, etc. Thereinto, graphite is generally considered an anode material with a theoretical capacity of only 372 mA h g−1, which cannot bear the high energy densities for long-range electric vehicles.19 The high-capacity lithium metal batteries also suffer low cycling efficiency and safety issue owing to dendrite growth and high reactivity of lithium metal anodes.20,21
With the rapid growth of energy demand in modern society, there is a constant need to develop new alternative electrode materials with high capacity and fast charging/discharging features. Certainly, an ideal anode material for the LIBs is required to possess the following characteristics:22 (a) large, stable, and reversible gravimetric (mA h g−1) and volumetric (mA h cm−3) capacities, suggesting that these materials are best composed of light atoms, to accommodate the highly sustainable and recyclable lithium content per formula unit. (b) The potential should be comparable to that of the Li metal (commonly, ≤0.5 V vs. Li) and fluctuate less with changes in the Li content. (c) These materials should be insoluble and inert in the electrolyte solvent. (d) There is good electronic and Li ionic conductivity. (e) Low-cost and green fabrication should be guaranteed. However, at present there are still many challenges to find alternative materials to meet all the above requirements.
In the past two decades, extensive research studies have been performed to find high-performance anodes to replace graphite in LIBs.23–30 However, until now, the commercial alternative anodes are constructed based on the amorphous/nanocrystalline composite of Sn/Co/C developed by Sony Co. in 2005, and its reversible and stable capacity may reach as high as only 450 mA h g−1.31 Clearly, further efforts from both academia and industry are essential to make in the development of high-performance anode materials.
Carbon and silicon are in the same row of the periodic table, while their bonding properties are quite different, owing to the presence of 3d-orbitals of silicon. The introduction of silicon into carbon materials may bring about remarkable changes in their electronic and optical properties. Recently, Shi et al. explored two-dimensional (2D) silicon carbide (SixC1−x with 0 ≤ x ≤ 1) monolayers by using a cluster expansion method in combination with density functional calculations, and they found that the thermodynamic stability and electronic properties of 2D SixC1−x sheets strongly depend on their stoichiometry and bonding structure.32 Furthermore, other binary silicon carbide nanosheets have also been investigated using the first-principles calculations, and the atomic arrangements may remarkably modify their electronic and photoelectronic properties.33–38
Note that numerous planar tetra-coordinate carbon (ptC) systems have been devised theoretically,39–42 and some stable ptC molecules have been successfully prepared and characterized experimentally.43 In contrast, the knowledge of planar tetra-coordinate silicon (ptSi) is very scarce at present.34,44 Here the optimized stable structure of C12H8Si exhibits a twisted tetra-coordinate Si (ttSi), as shown in Fig. 1a. It is well known that the combination of silicon and carbon can help design and build diverse materials, and these new silicon carbide phases generally have unique and tunable electronic and optoelectronic properties,33–38,45–48 which are of great potential for the development of nanoelectronic and photovoltaic devices.

In this work, the stabilization of ptSi in the compound and extended 2D systems was discussed. Based on the SiC12 building block containing ptSi (Fig. 1), a new type of 2D silicon carbide sheet was designed and characterized by extensive first-principles calculations and AIMD simulations. The presence of ptSi in the SiC8 siligraphene results in its high lithium-storage capacity and facile desorption of lithium ions, and thus the ptSi 2D-layered sheet should be a promising anode material for high-performance LIBs.
Computational details
Methods
All of the DFT calculations on molecules and their complexes with lithium were performed by using the Gaussian 09 program49 at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level. The frequency calculations at 298 K and 1 atm and vibrational analyses were used to confirm the optimized stationary points as the true minima with no imaginary frequency. In the computation of the interaction energies between lithium with the C12H8Si molecule, B3LYP, M062X, HSEH1PBE, and MP2 methods have been considered. The full geometry optimization and the energy band calculation of 2D SiC8 siligraphene are performed by using the density functional theory and the plane-wave basis set implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP).50,51 The ion–electron interactions are treated by the projector augmented wave technique with a cutoff energy of 500 eV. A Monkhorst pack mesh of k-points (11 × 11 × 1) was used for sampling the 2D Brillouin zone during the geometry optimization of SiC8 siligraphene by using the GGA-PBE functional. The whole configuration is allowed to relax until the maximum force is smaller than 0.01 eV Å−1. The electronic band structures are calculated using the GGA-PBE method with 45 k-points along the high symmetrical points. In DOS and PDOS calculations, the Brillouin zone was sampled with a 21 × 21 × 1 k point grid for the 2D system. The dynamic stability of SiC8 siligraphene was evaluated by using the phonon band structure obtained from the first-principles calculations in combination with the density functional perturbation theory (DFPT).52,53Ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations were carried out at the temperatures of 300, 600, 900, 1200, and 1500 K under a constant volume and constant temperature (NVT) ensemble in the DMol3 module.54 The nudged elastic band (NEB)55 method was employed to calculate diffusion energy barriers and low-energy pathways for Li and Li+ diffusions on SiC8 siligraphene.
Setup of ptSi 2D sheet
The SiC12 moiety cut from an optimized stable C12H8Si molecule with a twisted tetracoordinate Si (ttSi) served as a building block to construct an initial structure of the SiC8 2D sheet, and the full geometry optimization leads to planar SiC8 siligraphene with the lattice parameters of a = b = 5.2 Å (Fig. 1e). We note that the structural conversion of tetra-coordinate silicon from ttSi in the initial configuration to ptSi occurs during geometry optimization, and the optimized SiC8 planar 2D network with ptSi was used in the following calculations. A vacuum distance of 12 Å was set to keep the negligible interaction between SiC8 siligraphene sheets in calculation.
Results and discussion
Orbital levels and ptSi stabilization
Plausible structures and bonding properties of the C12H8Si molecular structural unit were examined first. The C12H8Si monomer cannot maintain a stable planar configuration, and its out-of-plane distortion leads to a more stable structure with twisted tetra-coordinate silicon (ttSi) (Fig. 1, Fig. S1 and S2†). Interestingly, here the planarization of C12H8Si is much more favorable than that of the corresponding C12H8C energetically (Fig. S3†). For the simplest square planar molecules CH4 and SiH4, the HOMO and LUMO orbitals have completely opposite levels, where the p-like π-type HOMO (a2u) and σ-type LUMO (b1g) in CH4 are converted to the corresponding π-type LUMO (a2u) and σ-type HOMO (b1g) in SiH4 (Fig. S4†). Such bonding features indicate that ptC and ptSi behave as π-donor/σ-acceptor and π-acceptor/σ-donor, respectively. Clearly, the conjugate interactions of the electron-deficient and electron-rich π ligands can stabilize ptC and ptSi, respectively, and actually the π-acceptor/σ-donor substituents widely exist in ptC compounds.43,45–47,56–60
The energy levels of selected frontier molecular orbitals in C12H8Si reveal that the HOMO–LUMO splitting of ttSi-C12H8Si is 2.5 eV, much larger than 0.6 eV of ptSi-C12H8Si (Fig. 1a and b). The planarization of the C12H8Si molecular structural unit not only reduces the HOMO–LUMO gap, but also leads to quasi-degenerate LUMO and LUMO+1 orbitals. We note that the LUMO+1–LUMO+2 gap is 2.7 eV in ptSi-C12H8Si (Fig. 1b), much larger than 1.6 eV in ttSi-C12H8Si (Fig. 1a). The NBO analysis indicates that the planarization leads to the orbital hybridization change of Si from the tetrahedral sp3 in ttSi to the square sp2d in ptSi. Furthermore, the pz and dz2 orbitals of Si participate in LUMO and LUMO+1 and they may accommodate additional four electrons, leading to a stable closed-shell electronic structure of ptSi species, as observed in C8N4H8Si with ptSi (Fig. 1d) and an octahedral coordination compound (Fig. S5†). The low-energy and degenerate LUMO and LUMO+1 orbitals of the ptSi structural unit lead to its strong ability to store electrons.
Interactions between lithium and C12H8Si
As the most ideal element for portable batteries, lithium has been widely used for the development of batteries. Here we investigated the interaction between lithium and the C12H8Si structural unit. In order to figure out possible adsorption patterns, the metal–π interactions between lithium and 1,3-butadiene were investigated first (Fig. S6 and S7†), and the obtained results reveal that the electrons from lithium are transferred to the antibonding π* orbital of 1,3-butadiene, resulting in the equalization of C–C bond lengths. Such charge-transfer interactions still maintain the structural planarity. Accordingly, similar lithium–π interactions for ptSi-C12H8Si can be conceived.

Fig. 1c, f and Fig. S8† show the optimized structures of the most stable arrangement of lithium atoms on C12H8Si. For C12H8Si-Li4, the nonmagnetic ground state has an up–down–up–down (udud) configuration for four lithium atoms (Fig. 1f and Table S1†). We note that the introduction of four Li atoms leads to the C–C bond equalization and a perfect planar C12H8Si moiety in D4h symmetry. These structural features of C12H8Si-Li4 also imply that the four electrons from Li atoms enter into the low-energy and degenerate LUMO and LUMO+1 orbitals and stabilize the ptSi-C12H8Si structural unit, as shown in Fig. 1c.
The results in Table 1 show that there are relatively strong interactions between Li and the ptSi system, and the average adsorption energies per lithium atom remain at about 50 kcal mol−1, which are less influenced by the lithium content. Quite interestingly, the interactions between Li+ and ptSi-C12H8Si are fairly sensitive to the Li+ content, and the average binding energies per lithium cation for ptSi-C12H8Si-Li22+ are only about 5 kcal mol−1, while more lithium ions cannot be efficiently bound to the ptSi species. Such relatively weak Li+⋯ptSi-C12H8Si interactions in ptSi-C12H8Si-Linn+ (n ≥ 2) can be ascribed to the strong repulsive interactions between lithium ions and silicon atoms (Fig. S9 and S10†). We note that the positive charge of the ptSi atom increases remarkably with the number of lithium cations (Fig. S10†), which results in strong electrostatic repulsions between ptSi and Li+. In contrast, the Li⋯C6H6 interactions are much weaker than the Li+⋯C6H6 interactions (Table S2†). Presumably, a 2D ptSi extended system shows quite different behaviors toward Li adsorption and Li+ desorption, compared to graphene, and such 2D ptSi anode materials should be of high potential for Li storage and Li+ migration. These novel features of the ptSi-based materials are highly required for high-performance LIBs.

Structure and stability of the ptSi 2D sheet
Inspired by the novel properties of the ptSi-C12H8Si molecular structural unit, we designed a new 2D planar structure, SiC8 siligraphene, based on the SiC12 building block (Fig. 1). The optimized lattice parameters are a = b = 5.235 Å (Fig. 2a). Here there are two types of C–C bonds (1.513 and 1.410 Å) and one kind of C–Si bond (1.880 Å). For an ideal anode in the lithium ion battery, its stability is very important for possible practical applications. To evaluate the stability of the extended ptSi structure, the cohesive energy is calculated first according toEcoh = (nEC + mESi − ESiC8)/(n + m),where EC, ESi, and ESiC8 are the total energies of single C atom, single Si atom, and the unit cell of SiC8 siligraphene, respectively. The calculations show that the SiC8 siligraphene sheet has relatively large cohesive energies of 6.54 eV per atom, which coincide with 6.51 eV of SiC solid (6H) and are larger than those of SiC2 siligraphene (6.04 eV) and Si solid (4.57 eV),34,61 revealing the strong covalent bonds in SiC8 siligraphene.

(b) The radial distribution of selected interatomic distances in SiC8 siligraphene. (c) Calculated partial pair correlation functions (g(r)) at the temperatures from 300 to 1500 K. 
Furthermore, the dynamic stability of SiC8 siligraphene was examined by calculating phonon dispersion along the high-symmetry points. Here all predicted phonon spectra are real, except for three very small imaginary frequencies of 0.15i, 0.12i and 0.12i cm−1 for the corresponding translational modes, and thus the SiC8 2D sheet with ptSi is dynamically stable (Fig. 2a and Fig. S11†). Furthermore, these SiC8 2D sheets can be put together to form a graphite-like structure, SiC8 siligraphite (Fig. S11†). For SiC8 siligraphite, we do not find the modes with imaginary frequencies, and the corresponding translational frequencies almost approach zero due to the interlayer interactions (Fig. S11 and S12†). The predicted interlayer cohesive energy and distance of SiC8 siligraphite are 87.6 meV per atom and 3.0 Å (Fig. S11†), respectively, showing much stronger stacking interactions than the graphite with an interlayer cohesive energy of 43.4 meV per atom and an interlayer distance of 3.45 Å.
In sharp contrast to SiC8 siligraphene, the SiC2, SiC3, and SiC4 2D sheets with ptSi display relatively large imaginary frequencies in their phonon spectra (Fig. S13†), and thus SiC8 siligraphene has the high dynamic stability among these 2D sheets. In particular, the highest vibrational frequency of SiC8 siligraphene reaches up to 1497 cm−1, much higher than those of silene (580 cm−1)61 and MoS2 monolayer (473 cm−1).62 The high frequency mode corresponds to the in-plane vibrations of C–C bonds, while the lowest optical mode (80 cm−1) arises from the out-of-plane movement of Si and C atoms. The relatively high frequencies for the in-plane vibrations of Si and C atoms indicate robust Si–C interactions.
Meanwhile, to verify if this new 2D ptSi material is stable in an extreme environment, the ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations were performed by using both 2 × 2 and 3 × 3 supercells. A series of individual AIMD simulations were carried out to evaluate the thermal stability of monolayer SiC8 siligraphene at the temperatures of 300, 600, 900, 1200, and 1500 K under a constant-volume and constant temperature (NVT) ensemble. The system was equilibrated by using a Massive GGM thermostat for 10 ps with the time step of 1 fs. The GGA-PBE functional with the cut-off energy of 400 eV implemented in the DMol3 module was used in the AIMD simulations. Snapshots of the final frame from the corresponding molecular dynamics simulations from 300 to 1500 K are shown in Fig. S14,† and the AIMD simulations indicate that the ptSi structural framework is almost unchanged as the temperature increases. Furthermore, the calculated partial pair correlation functions (g(r)) at different temperatures show the main peaks at about 1.4, 1.8, 2.4, 2.7, 3.4, 4.0, 5.3, and 5.9 Å, responsible for C1–C2, Si1–C1, C1–C3, Si1–C2, C6–C10, Si1–C9, C5–C10, and C4–C11 distances, respectively, and are less changed, even though the curve gradually may become smooth from 300 K to 1500 K (Fig. 2b). We note that the AIMD simulations from 2 × 2 and 3 × 3 supercells predict almost the same structural relaxation behaviors (Fig. S14 and S15†). Clearly, SiC8 siligraphene is of high thermal stability, like the new-type SiC4 single-crystalline semiconductor.63
Electronic properties of SiC8 siligraphene
It was noted that diamond and diamond-like SiC4 material are wide-bandgap semiconductors,63 while for the 2D extended systems consisting of Si and C, their electronic properties strongly depend on the binary composition and the atomic arrangement. For example, 2D Si graphene64 and graphene65,66 are both semimetals, and SiC2 and SiC7 siligraphenes have a metallic character,34,67 while g-SiC2 siligraphene and SiC sheet were predicted to have direct band gaps of 1.09 eV (ref. 68) and 2.55 eV,69 respectively.
To get an insight into the electronic structure of SiC8 siligraphene, we computed its band structure and density of states (DOS) (Fig. 3a). Different from graphene, Si graphene, and the single-layer SiC sheet, SiC8 siligraphene is metallic, characterized by several energy levels across the Fermi level in the band structure and the peak at the Fermi level in the DOS (Fig. 3a). The partial DOS in Fig. 3b reveals that the states at the Fermi level are basically contributed by C-2p orbitals, and a few compositions therein come from the Si-3p orbitals. Accordingly, the metallic properties of SiC8 siligraphene can be ascribed to the delocalization of cycloolefin. Fig. 3c presents the highest occupied electronic state (HOES) and the lowest unoccupied electronic state (LUES) at the X point, respectively. Clearly, there are strong bonding interactions between Si and C atoms, while the LUES is mainly contributed by the 2p orbital of C atoms, suggesting that SiC8 siligraphene has a strong ability to accept electrons. The corresponding schematic representations based on a 2 × 2 unit show these features more clearly (Fig. S16†).

(c) The highest occupied electronic state (left) and the lowest unoccupied electronic state of ormuSiC8 siligraphene at the X point. The isosurface value is 0.4 e au−1. 
Theoretical capacity and stability of the lithiated SiC8 2D sheet
The above-mentioned results show that SiC8 siligraphene is a conductor and an electron acceptor. In order to explore its electron-storage ability as the anode material, the adsorption of lithium on 2D SiC8 siligraphene was investigated. In consideration of a distance of 2.8 Å for the non-repulsive interaction of the Li2 dimer in the most stable structure of C12H8Si-Li4 (Fig. 1c and Fig. S9†), the Si4C32Li16 and Si4C32Li24 systems were considered and optimized (Fig. S17 and S18a†). The predicted average adsorption energies per lithium atom are 53.1 and 51.7 kcal mol−1 for Si4C32Li16 and Si4C32Li24 systems, respectively, suggesting that the maximum lithium-storage capacity is 24 for one 2 × 2 structural unit, i.e., each ptSi can accommodate six lithium atoms.
In terms of the formula Ct (mA h g−1) = n × 26801/Mw, the calculated theoretical capacity is 1297 mA h g−1, much larger than 372 mA h g−1 for graphite.70 Furthermore, the AIMD simulations were carried out to evaluate the stability of the Si4C32Li24 complex. The system was equilibrated by using a Massive GGM thermostat for 10 ps with the time step of 1 fs at the temperatures of 340 K under a constant-volume and constant temperature (NVT) ensemble. The GGA-PBE functional with the cut-off energy of 400 eV implemented in the DMol3 module was used in AIMD simulations. The last snapshot from 10 ps AIMD simulations displays that the entire structural skeleton of the Si4C32Li24 complex of the SiC8 2D sheet with the lithium system (lithiated to Li6Si) almost remains unchanged, although it experiences a little out-of-plane distortion (Fig. S18b†). The calculated phonon spectrum indicates that the out-of-plane mode of Si4C32Li24 corresponds to a small imaginery frequency (33.5i cm−1), which is contributed by silicon and adjacent lithium atoms (Fig. S19†). As a whole, the Si4C32Li24 complex system with the high lithium content is of relatively high thermal stability, which lends support to the finding that SiC8 siligraphene is quite a promising anode material for LIBs, owing to its high lithium storage density. Moreover, the predicted phonon spectrum of the optimized lithiated SiC8Li system with a planar structural skeleton of SiC8 silgraphene reveals that there are no phonon modes with imaginary frequencies (Fig. S20†), and thus the SiC8Li complex system is dynamically stable like the SiC8 2D sheet.
Lithium adsorption on SiC8 siligraphene and graphene
Li intercalation and Li+ deintercalation are important for the performance of LIBs, and the adsorption of Li and Li+ on SiC8 siligraphene and graphene was studied. All related complexes were optimized using the GGA-PBE functional implemented in the VASP package. Here two most preferred adsorption sites 1 and 2 on SiC8 siligraphene were considered (Fig. S21a†), and the calculated adsorption energies are 48.8 (1) and 59.7 kcal mol−1 (2) for Li, and 52.3 (1) and 60.0 kcal mol−1 (2) for Li+, respectively. For comparison, the adsorption of lithium on graphene was also investigated (Fig. S21b and Table S3†), and the predicted binding energies are 0.1 and 50.2 kcal mol−1 for Li and Li+, respectively. Clearly, the 2D SiC8 siligraphene sheet with ptSi has much stronger Li-storage ability than graphene.
Migration of Li and Li+ on SiC8 siligraphene
The lithium diffusion in the LIB system plays a vital role in the fast charging/discharging process, and thus the movement of Li and Li+ on the surface of SiC8 siligraphene was investigated. Generally, the surface diffusion behavior is related to the corresponding barriers and distances of the migration pathways. Here the possible low-energy pathways (Paths I ↔ V) for lithium migration on SiC8 siligraphene were explored (Fig. 4a). Calculations reveal that the relatively low-energy steps II (3 → 2), III (3 → 4), and V (5 → 6) experience the barriers of 0.19, 0.21, and 0.11 eV for the lithium atom, and 0.25, 0.19, and 0.10 eV for the lithium ion (Fig. 4b), respectively, showing that both Li and Li+ exhibit similar migration behaviors on the 2D SiC8 sheet. Pathway IV (4 → 5) across ptSi has a relatively high barrier of 0.74 eV for Li or 0.65 eV for Li+. These predicted barriers from 0.10 to 0.25 eV for the low-energy paths are comparable to ∼0.30 eV for Li diffusion within graphene and graphite interlayers.71 Accordingly, planar SiC8 siligraphene with ptSi should be a promising electrode material for LIBs, owing to the presence of low-barrier pathways for lithium migration.

Cell voltage and recycle
According to the above calculated results, the 2 × 2 supercell of SiC8 siligraphene can accommodate up to 24 lithium atoms. In order to evaluate the stability of the operating voltage, the cell voltage of the 2D ptSi SiC8 sheet with the corresponding lithium storage capacity was estimated.

The Gibbs free energy change for the above reaction ΔGr(≡ ΔEr + PΔVr − TΔSr) can be approximated using the internal energy change at 0 K, since the volume and entropy effects are small and can be neglected here, as shown in previous studies.72,73 The corresponding average cell voltage (V) at room temperature for an intercalation reaction involving xLi+ ions can be approximately calculated using a computational formula based on the energy difference:74V ≈ {E(Si4C32) + xE(Li) − E(Si4C32Lix)}/xewhere e is the electron charge. The adsorption energies of the 2 × 2 supercell of SiC8 siligraphene with different lithium contents are shown in Fig. 4c. The corresponding average cell voltages are 2.47, 2.28, 2.30, and 2.24 V, respectively, which are close to the voltage value of the commercial anode materials based on a TiO2 polymorph.75 Meanwhile, we calculated the average adsorption energies of lithium for Si4C40H16Li16 and Si2C22H12Li8 with different positive charges using  
As Fig. 4d shows, the average adsorption energies decrease significantly when the total charges are beyond +4, and there is a similar phenomenon for Si2C22H12Li8 (Fig. S22†). Apparently, the 2D ptSi sheet exhibits relatively high and stable operating voltage and facile lithium-ion extraction, which are important for battery stability and recycle during the process of charging and discharging.
Conclusions
In summary, extensive density functional theory calculations were performed on a ptSi C12H8Si molecule and its resultant 2D SiC8 siligraphene periodic system. The molecular planarization of C12H8Si can remarkably lower the energy levels of LUMO and LUMO+1 and substantially enhance its electron-storage ability. The stabilization of ptSi-C12H8Si can be realized by capturing four electrons. Alternatively, the ptSi-C12H8Si molecule can easily accommodate four lithium atoms, yielding a stable and nonmagnetic ptSi-C12H8Si-Li4 complex with novel properties for Li adsorption and Li+ desorption. Based on the ptSi SiC12 building block, a newly designed SiC8 siligraphene 2D network containing ptSi was constructed, and it was predicted to have high thermal and dynamic stability, good conductivity, and strong electron-storage ability with a theoretical capacity of 1297 mA h g−1. The predicted relative energy profiles for Li and Li+ diffusions on the 2D ptSi SiC8 sheet show that Li insertion and Li+ extraction are quite facile. Such novel structural and electronic properties of SiC8 siligraphene containing ptSi, as well as its appropriate interactions with Li and Li+, are highly required for a promising anode, and thus these results open up an avenue to develop new electrode materials for high-performance LIBs.
