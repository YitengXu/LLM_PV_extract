1. Introduction
In the past 200 years, the enormous consumption of fossil fuels has resulted in the release of huge quantities of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide, and it has caused serious global climate changes. On other hand, fossil fuels have been predicted to be used up within the next 200 years. Therefore, to mitigate global environmental problems and energy demand, the search for clean and renewable energy sources to replace fossil fuels is one of the most urgent tasks scientists are facing in this century. A promising strategy to obtain new energy sources is artificial photosynthesis, which involves coupling of sunlight-driven water splitting with CO2 reduction (Scheme 1).1 Water splitting includes oxidation of water to oxygen (2H2O → O2 + 4H+ + 4e−) and reduction of protons to hydrogen (2H+ + 2e− → H2). The oxidation of water to oxygen provides an unlimited source of protons and electrons for both hydrogen generation and CO2 reduction (such as CO2 + 2H+ + 2e− → CO + H2O or CO2 + 6H+ + 6e− → CH3OH + H2O). The thermodynamic potentials of water oxidation, proton and CO2 reduction (apparent standard redox potentials vs. SHE, pH 7) are listed in Table 1.2–4

Ideally, the energy required for these reactions can be obtained directly from sunlight or from solar-derived electricity. However, for these reactions to occur at reasonable rates and low overpotentials, cheap and earth-abundant robust catalysts with high efficiency and selectivity are required. In the past decades, considerable efforts have been devoted to developing efficient transition-metal catalysts for water splitting and carbon dioxide reduction.4–14 Notably, 2,2′:6′,2′′:6′′,2′′′-quaterpyridine (qpy) based metal complexes have been found to be excellent catalysts for both water splitting and CO2 reduction in recent years. In this tutorial, we summarize the major advances in artificial photosynthesis catalyzed by these metal quaterpyridine complexes.
2. Quaterpyridine and its complexes
Polypyridines are strong and versatile chelating ligands that can form complexes with transitions metals with diverse architectures and with rich and useful physical and chemical properties. Increasing the number of pyridyl units results in an increase of chelating ability. In the polypyridine family, the simplest one is the bidentate 2,2′-bipyridine (bpy), complexes based on this ligand have been widely studied for water splitting15 and CO2 reduction.9 Directly linking two bidentate 2,2′-bipyridine generates the tetradentate 2,2′:6′,2′′:6′′,2′′′-quaterpyridine (qpy), which was first isolated by Morgan and Burstall in the 1930s,16 but the synthetic method was tedious and the yield was poor. However, in recent decades, much improved methods for the synthesis of qpy were developed, which has been summarized by Stefankiewicz recently (Scheme 2).16 The most concise approach, combining high efficiency and step economy was developed by Chupakhin17 through dimerization of 2,2′-bipyridine 1-oxide in the presence of tert-butyllithium, followed by reduction with triethyl phosphite P(OEt)3.

The availability of improved synthetic methods for qpy has boosted the development of metal complexes of this ligand in recent years, particularly in the area of metallosupramolecular materials, biological activity and energy transfer devices.16 In this tutorial we will describe recent developments in the use of metal qpy complexes as catalysts for both water splitting and CO2 reduction.
Generally speaking, and as shown by X-ray crystallography of a large number of metal quaterpyridine complexes, there are three coordination modes for qpy (Scheme 3). Two of them involve N4 coordination to form (a) tetradentate species (e.g. [Cu(qpy)](ClO4)218) or (b) bis(bidentate) species (usually observed in Cu(I) and Ag(I) complexes, e.g. [Cu2(qpy)2](PF6)2 and [Ag2(qpy)2](BF4)2).19 The third one (c) involves hypodentate N3 coordination (e.g. [Fe(qpy)2](ClO4)2).20 Coordination mode (a) is most common, i.e. qpy usually functions as a planar, tetradentate ligand to chelate metal ions to form mononuclear complexes in square-planar or octahedral geometry. A number of these complexes have been found to show various useful properties. For example, [Ru(qpy)Cl2] exhibits cytotoxicity towards cancer cells,21 [Pt(qpy)](PF6)2 binds to CT-DNA by intercalation,22 and [Mn(qpy)(H2O)2](ClO4)2 is an active catalyst for the oxidation of alkenes.23 In our groups, a series of octahedral quaterpyridine complexes (Fe(II), Co(II), Cu(II), Ru(II) and Os(II)), have been synthesized and investigated as catalysts for water splitting and CO2 reduction.

3. Properties of quaterpyridine complexes as catalysts for artificial photosynthesis
M(qpy) complexes possess the following unique features which make them excellent catalysts for both water splitting and CO2 reduction reactions.
(a) Qpy is reasonably oxidation resistant and can stabilize metal centres in high oxidation states.
(b) Qpy is a good π-acceptor ligand and can stabilize metals in low oxidation states. CO2 reduction can occur at relatively small over-potentials via a low-valent active intermediate.
(c) Qpy is a ‘short’ ligand and may not be able to completely wrap around a metal centre, especially for 4d and 5d metals. Thus it is possible to incorporate an additional small ligand, such as O2−, in the equatorial plane and generate a seven-coordinate complex, which can be a useful feature in catalysis, especially for water oxidation. The Ru-bda family of catalysts, [Ru(bda)(L)2] (bda = 2,2′-bipyridine-6,6′-dicarboxylate, L = aromatic N-heterocyclic ligand) are among the most efficient WOCs. It is believed that the active intermediate is a seven-coordinate ruthenium(V) oxo species, [Ru(bda)(L)2(O)]+ (Fig. 1).6,24

(d) The flat M(qpy) moiety can be readily adsorbed onto planar materials such as an electrode surface or a solid support to generate a supported molecular catalytic material (Scheme 4).

(e) The electronic and steric properties of M(qpy) catalysts can be readily tuned by adding various substituents on the qpy ligand (Fig. 2).

(f) It is relatively straight forward to link two qpy ligands together to generate binuclear quaterpyridine complexes which may facilitate multi-electron transfer catalysis and metal cooperativity (Fig. 3).

4. Quaterpyridine complexes for water splitting
As mentioned before, water splitting consists in two half reactions, oxidation of water to oxygen (2H2O → O2 + 4H+ + 4e−) and reduction of protons to hydrogen (2H+ + 2e− → H2). The oxidation of water is considered the bottleneck of water splitting as four electrons and four protons are needed to be pumped out from two water molecules to generate O2. In the past decades, tremendous efforts have been devoted to tackle this challenge using both solid materials and molecular catalysts. Comparing with heterogeneous catalysts, molecular catalysts have an advantage of high efficiency and ease of mechanistic studies. Although a large number of transition metal complexes, including noble metal (Ru6,24 and Ir25 based) and earth-abundant metal complexes (Mn,26,27 Fe,28 Co,29,30 Ni31 and Cu32), have been developed as efficient molecular catalysts for water oxidation, the majority of these catalysts are unstable due to oxidative degradation of the ligands.33–35 Quaterpyridine is able to stabilize metal complexes in both high and low oxidation state as it is oxidation-resistant and a good π-acceptor ligand. The active intermediates in these water oxidation catalysts are believed to be a metal oxo (MO) or metal oxyl (M–O˙) species, which can oxidize water by either coupling of two MO intermediates or by water nucleophilic attack.24
4.1 Catalytic water oxidation and proton reduction by [Co(qpy)(H2O)2]2+
In 2012, Lau and coworkers reported that the cobalt quaterpyridine complex, [CoII(qpy)(H2O)2]2+, is an active catalyst for both water oxidation and reduction.36 Photocatalytic activity of [Co(qpy)(H2O)2]2+ for water oxidation was examined by using [Ru(bpy)3]Cl2 (bpy = 2,2′-bipyridine, Fig. 4) as the photosensitizer (PS) and Na2S2O8 as the sacrificial oxidant in borate buffer (pH 8). Upon irradiation by visible light (λ = 475 nm) for 1.5 h, O2 was produced with a TON of 335 (Scheme 5). Remarkably, using stoichiometric amounts of [RuIII(bpy)3]3+ as the oxidant, a high initial turnover frequency (TOF) of up to 4 s−1 was obtained, which is comparable to that of the carbon-free cobalt polyoxometalate water oxidation catalyst [Co4(H2O)2(PW9O34)2]10− (>5 s−1).37 Mechanistic studies, including kinetics and quenching experiments, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) and dynamic light scattering measurement (DLS) showed that [CoII(qpy)(H2O)2]2+ functions as a molecular water oxidation catalyst. Evidently the strongly chelating and oxidation resistant qpy ligand plays a key role in the stabilization of the active intermediate for water oxidation, which is presumably a high-valent cobalt oxyl species (CoIV–O˙).

 Scheme 5  Proposed mechanism for visible-light driven water oxidation catalysed by [CoII(qpy)(H2O)2]2+. 
Interestingly, [Co(qpy)(H2O)2]2+ can also catalyse the visible light-driven proton reduction in acetonitrile. H2 is produced with a TON of 530 using p-cyanoanilinium as a proton source, [IrIII(ppy)2(bpy)]PF6 (ppy = anion of 2-phenylpyridine, Fig. 4) as the photosensitizer (PS) and triethanolamine (TEOA) as the sacrificial donor. The modest TON for H2 is due to the decomposition of [IrIII(ppy)2(bpy)]PF6. Using [IrIII(dF(CF3)ppy)2(dtbbpy)]PF6 (dF(CF3)ppy = anion of 2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)-5-trifluoromethylpyridine, dtbbpy = 4,4′-di-tert-butyl-2,2′-bipyridine, Fig. 4) as PS, which has a higher quantum yield and excited state lifetime than [IrIII(ppy)2(bpy)]PF6, a higher H2 TON of 1150 was obtained. Water can also be used as the proton source. In the presence of 5% H2O, H2 is produced with a slightly lower TON of 890. In this case, a blue species, probably [CoI(qpy)]+, was observed, which may be the active intermediate for proton reduction. Notably, [Co(qpy)(H2O)2]2+ is the first reported catalyst that can perform both water oxidation and reduction (Scheme 6).

4.2 Catalytic water oxidation by [Ru(qpy)(L)2]2+
Inspired by the work of Sun et al., who reported that [Ru(bda)(L)2] (bda = 2,2′-bipyridine-6,6′-dicarboxylate, L = pyridine and derivatives) are highly efficient WOCs that form seven-coordinate RuO active intermediates,6 Lau and coworkers synthesized a series of six-coordinate ruthenium quaterpyridine complexes with two pyridine-type ligands in the axial positions.38 The synthetic route for [Ru(qpy)(pic)2]2+ (pic = 4-picoline) is shown in Scheme 7.38 The X-ray structure of [Ru(qpy)(pic)2]2+ (Fig. 5) shows that the N–Ru–N bite angle in the equatorial plane is relatively large (120.9 Å), which may facilitate the formation of a seven-coordinate RuO active species during water oxidation. Although the cyclic voltammetry (CV) of [Ru(qpy)(pic)2]2+ at pH 1 does not show any catalytic current for water oxidation, the ruthenium complex was able to catalyse water oxidation to give O2 using (NH4)2Ce(NO3)6 (CAN) as the oxidant, with TON of 576 and TOF of 1.5 min−1. From the reaction mixture a ruthenium(II) complex bearing the qpy-N,N′′′-dioxide (ONNO) ligand, [Ru(ONNO)(pic)2]3+ (ONNO = 1,1′′′-dioxide-2,2′:6′,2′′:6′′,2′′′-quaterpyridine) was isolated. The X-ray structure of this complex is shown in Fig. 5. In contrast to the Ruqpy complex, the RuONNO complex exhibits a catalytic current in the CV at pH 1, suggesting that it catalyses water oxidation (Fig. 6). The RuONNO complex was also able to catalyse water oxidation by CAN (Fig. 7). Notably O2 from Ruqpy showed an induction period, which is absent for RuONNO. These results strongly suggest that Ruqpy is a pre-catalyst; it is first oxidized to RuONNO which is the real catalyst for water oxidation. The active intermediate was proposed to be a seven-coordinate ruthenium(V) oxo species, [Ru(O)(ONNO)(L)2]2+, by analogy to the WOC [Ru(bda)(L)2].

Kinetic studies suggested that catalytic water oxidation by [RuV(O)(ONNO)(pic)2]3+ probably occurs by a “water nucleophilic attack” mechanism. Although Lau and coworkers were unable to isolate the seven-coordinate ruthenium(V) oxo intermediate, DFT calculations suggested that this intermediate is stable with a RuO distance of 1.767 Å.38
It should be noted that similar Co(ONNO) species was not detected by ESI-MS in water oxidation catalyzed by [Co(qpy)(H2O)2]2+. In this case, the active species is probably a six-coordinate cobalt oxyl species (CoIV–O), which presumably undergoes O–O bond formation with H2O more readily than intramolecular O-atom transfer to outer N atom of the qpy ligand. On the other hand, in the case of Ru, the initial species formed upon adding of Ce(IV) is probably a seven-coordinate ruthenium(V) oxo species, [RuV(O)(qpy)(pic)2]2+. Since the oxo ligand is in the equatorial plane, it should be in close proximity to the outer pyridyl N-atoms of the qpy ligand. Hence, the complex should be well set up for intramolecular O-atom transfer to N. Moreover, as evidenced form the X-ray structures, there is considerable strain in the planar coordinate mode of the qpy ligand in Ru(qpy) unit; however, this strain is relieved on conversion to Ru(ONNO).
Although the seven-coordinate [Ru(O)(ONNO)(L)2]2+ species is too reactive to be isolated, it was reasoned that the corresponding osmium oxo complex could be formed and identified, since osmium oxo complexes are in general much less oxidizing than ruthenium oxo complexes. With this in mind, Lau and coworkers prepared the osmium quaterpyridine complexes [OsII(qpy)(pic)Cl]+ (pic = 4-picoline). Upon addition of CAN the seven-coordinate osmium(V) oxo complex [OsV(qpy)(pic)Cl(O)]2+ was isolated (Scheme 8 and Fig. 8) and characterized by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), infrared spectroscopy (IR) as well as X-ray crystallography.39

Although [OsV(qpy)(pic)Cl(O)]2+ was unable to oxidize water, it readily undergoes O-atom transfer to phosphine and thioanisole, as well as H-atom abstraction from alkylaromatics in CH3CN at ambient conditions.
5. Quaterpyridine complexes for CO2 reduction
Electrochemical and photochemical CO2 reduction to fuels or commodity chemicals remains a Holy Grail for chemists. In the past decades, tremendous efforts have been made on electrocatalytic14,40 and photocatalytic10 reduction of CO2 using molecular catalysts.41 As mentioned above, qpy is a strongly chelating and good π-acceptor ligand, hence it should also be able to stabilize the reduced active species of metal complexes for CO2 reduction.
5.1 Quaterpyridine complexes for electrocatalytic reduction of CO2
In 1995, Che and coworkers first reported the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction by the cobalt and nickel quaterpyridine complexes [M(qpy)(H2O)2]2+ (Scheme 9, M = Co, Ni) in MeCN.42 Controlled-potential electrolysis (CPE) of [Co(qpy)(H2O)2]2+ at −1.70 V vs. SCE in CO2-saturated MeCN for 1 hour led to the production of CO with a faradaic efficiency of 80% and TONCO of about 20 (based on the total amount of [Co(qpy)(H2O)2]2+ present in solution). In the case of the nickel catalyst, only trace amount of CO was observed. Notably, [Co(qpy)(H2O)2]2+ was readily electrodeposited onto the electrode surface due to the planar and aromatic nature of qpy. Using Co(qpy) modified graphite cloth as the electrode for CPE in CO2-saturated MeCN at −1.7 V vs. SCE, CO was produced with a faradaic efficiency of 35%. Most importantly, the cobalt-modified electrode was also active for CO2 reduction in aqueous solution; CPE at −1.3 V on Co(qpy) graphite cloth generates CO with a faradaic efficiency of 36%.
 Scheme 9  Electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to CO by metal quaterpyridine complexes (formal oxidation is indicated for Co). 
In 2016, Robert and Lau et al. re-examined the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 by [M(qpy)(H2O)2]2+ (M = Co, Fe).43 They found that both the efficiency and the overpotential for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction by [M(qpy)(H2O)2]2+ (M = Co, Fe) can be greatly enhanced by the addition of a weak Brønsted acid such as phenol. The faradaic efficiency and selectivity for CO formation catalysed by [Co(qpy)(H2O)2]2+ are up to 94% and 99%, respectively, in the presence of 1 M phenol at a lower potential of −1.4 V vs. SCE. In the case of [Fe(qpy)(H2O)2]2+, the faradaic efficiency for CO production was only 37%, but the selectivity is 100%.
To get a better understanding of the electrocatalytic mechanism, Robert and Lau carried out detailed electrochemical studies.44,45 In the case of [Fe(qpy)(H2O)2]2+ (noted as Feqpy in Scheme 10), the active species towards CO2 activation is the one electron-reduced species [FeI(qpy)(H2O)2]+, which binds CO2 to generate the FeIIqpyCO2˙− intermediate. In the presence of a weak acid, such as phenol, the intermediate FeIIqpyCO2˙− undergoes further irreversible reduction, leading to C–O bond cleavage to generate the CO coordinated FeIqpyCO, from which CO was released with over 99% selectivity and a faradaic efficiency (FE) of 48%, at an overpotential as low as 240 mV ( = −0.96 V vs. SCE was used to calculate the overpotential). The low FE is due to the formation of an inactive species Fe0qpyCO, which has been detected by Infrared spectroelectrochemistry and supported by DFT calculations. Further reduction of Fe0qpyCO takes place at ca. −1.3 V vs. SCE in the presence of triethanolamine (TEOA), leading to the formation of metallic iron particles on the electrode surface, which are capable of reducing CO2 to CH4 with a faradaic yield of ca. 2.1% at −1.65 V vs. SCE. TEOA is required for the de-metallation process and could react with CO2 and H2O to produce HCO3− and (HOCH2CH2)3NH+. (HOCH2CH2)3NH+ may facilitate CH4 formation.46

In the presence of a high concentration of phenol (3 M, Scheme 11),43,45 upon one electron reduction of [CoII(qpy)(H2O)2]2+ to [CoI(qpy)(H2O)2]+, the two water molecules on the [CoI(qpy)(H2O)2]+ are replaced by two phenols to form [CoI(qpy)(PhOH)2]+, with an equilibrium constant K of 0.18 M−2. The new species [CoI(qpy)(PhOH)2]+ likely undergoes one-electron ligand centred reduction at ca. −1.27 V vs. SCE to generate [CoI(qpy)˙−(PhOH)2], which is the active species for CO2 reduction. Interestingly, at lower concentrations of phenol (<1.5 M, Scheme 12),45 [CoI(qpy)(H2O)2]+ is reduced to [CoI(qpy)˙−] at E0 = −0.795 V vs. SCE. The [CoI(qpy)˙−] is unable to activate CO2. However, further one electron reduction of [CoI(qpy)˙−] at E0 = −1.51 V vs. SCE to [Co(qpy)]− triggers the catalytic reduction of CO2. It should be noted that [CoII(qpy)(H2O)2]2+ is one of the most active molecular catalysts (Fig. 9), with a turnover frequency up to 3.3 × 104 s−1 at a very low overpotential of 0.3 V.44

Remarkably, the catalysis for CO2 reduction by Co(qpy)Cl2 also works well in water. Robert and Lau et al. appended the Co(qpy)Cl2 at the surface of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) to generate a heterogeneous catalyst (Scheme 13).47 The carbon material (Co(qpy)Cl2@MWCNT) is comparable to the state-of-art CO2 reduction molecular catalyst both in terms of selectivity, rate and overpotential. In water at pH 7.3, CO is generated with 100% catalytic selectivity and 100% faradaic efficiency at very low catalyst loading. The current density is up to 0.94 mA cm−2 with a low overpotential of 240 mV (at −0.35 V vs. RHE). When the overpotential is raised to 340 mV, the current density is further increased to 9.3 mA cm−2; at this overpotential the catalyst can sustain for at least 4.5 h, leading to a TON of 89095. Impressively, the current density reaches 19.9 mA cm−2 at 425 mV overpotential. Such hybrid material combines the high selectivity of a homogeneous molecular catalyst with the robustness of a heterogeneous material.

5.2 Quaterpyridine complexes for photocatalytic reduction of CO2
Apart from electrochemical CO2 reduction, metal quaterpyridine complexes are also excellent catalysts for visible light-driven CO2 reduction. Recently, Robert and Lau et al. reported the photocatalytic CO2 reduction catalysed by metal quaterpyridine complexes.43 Both complexes [M(qpy)(H2O)2]2+ (M = Co, Fe) are highly efficient catalysts for photocatalytic CO2-to-CO conversion under visible light irradiation. Using Ru(bpy)32+ (bpy = 2,2′-bipyridine) as photosensitizer and 1,3-dimethyl-2-phenyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-benzo[d]imidazole (BIH, Fig. 10) as sacrificial reductant, [Co(qpy)(H2O)2]2+ gives a TONCO of 2660 as well as 98% selectivity for the CO2-to-CO conversion. Similarly, [Fe(qpy)(H2O)2]2+ affords a TONCO of >3000 and a selectivity of up to 95%. Remarkably, the organic dye purpurin (Fig. 10), which is cheap and commercially available, could also be used as photosensitizer. In this case, CO2 was selectively converted to CO with a TONCO of 1365 based on [Fe(qpy)(H2O)2]2+, which is the highest TONs for CO formation for systems using all earth-abundant materials.
 Fig. 10  Structures of the photosensitizer purpurin and sacrificial electron donor BIH. 
Based on mechanistic studies, the proposed mechanism involves initial reduction of [M(qpy)(H2O)2]2+ (M = Co, Fe) (noted as [MII(qpy)]2+ in Scheme 14), to the active species, formally [M0(qpy)] by the strong one electron reductant [Ru(bpy)3]+, which is generated by the reductive quenching of [Ru(bpy)3]2+* with BIH and TEOA. This active species then binds to CO2 through the carbon atom to form a M–CO2 adduct, this is followed by protonation and C–O bond cleavage to give CO and regenerates the catalyst. A similar mechanism is proposed for catalysis using purpurin as the photosensitizer.

The above mentioned visible-light-driven CO2 reduction system typically consists of three components, namely catalyst, photosensitizer and sacrificial donor. To be economically viable for future larger-scale device applications, all the components should be based on cheap and earth-abundant elements. So far, there are only very few systems using cheap organic dyes or earth-abundant transition metal complexes instead of noble-metal complexes such as Ru(bpy)32+ or Ir(ppy)3 as photosensitizers. Apart from employing the organic dye purpurin, Robert, Ishitani and Lau et al. recently found that [Fe(qpy)(H2O)2]2+ can also work well for photocatalytic CO2-to-CO conversion using mesoporous graphitic carbon nitride (mpg-C3N4) as the photosensitizer (Scheme 15).48 A TON of 155 and 97% selectivity for CO production are obtained after irradiation of an CH3CN/triethanolamine (4:1, v/v; 4 mL) solution containing [Fe(qpy)(H2O)2]2+ (20 μM) and mpg-C3N4 (8.0 mg) by visible light (λ ≥ 400 nm) for 17 hours. Notably, the apparent quantum yield is ca. 4.2%, which is among the highest among the photocatalytic CO2 reduction systems using C3N4 as photosensitizer. This system proves to be promising as a catalytic platform for future improvement and implementation in devices using only earth abundant and low-cost components.

In addition to the Co and Fe quaterpyridine complexes, the Cu(II) quaterpyridine complex [Cu(qpy)]2+ is also a highly efficient and selective molecular catalyst for the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 in CH3CN.18 A turnover number (TON) of 2425 for CO production is achieved within 3.5 hours irradiation using [Ru(bpy)3]2+ as photosensitizer and BIH/TEOA as sacrificial reductant. Interestingly, in the presence of a small amount of water (1–4%, v/v), the yield of CO was significantly enhanced. A TON of >12400 with 97% selectivity could be achieved in the presence of 3% water. Water was proposed to act as a weak acid, which may stabilize the metal–CO2 adduct intermediate via H-bonds and/or protonation, and facilitate cleaving one of the C–O bond to form CO and a H2O molecule. Mechanistic studies indicated that the initial species [Cu(qpy)]2+ is firstly reduced to a CuI species [Cu(qpy)]+ by BIH. The CuI species [Cu(qpy)]+ spontaneously dimerizes to form a binuclear CuI complex [Cu2(qpy)2]2+. Under photocatalytic conditions, the dimeric species [Cu2(qpy)2]2+ is further reduced to the active species Cu0(qpy) or CuI(qpy−), which was proposed to react with CO2 to yield CO (Scheme 16).

5.3 Binuclear cobalt quaterpyridine complex for photocatalytic reduction of CO2
CO2 can be reduced by two, four, six or eight electrons to generate various products (Table 1). In order to facilitate these multi-electron transfer reactions, Chen, Lau and Robert have designed a biqpy ligand (L), in which two qpy are linked together via a xanthene bridge.49 In principle, four or higher electron reduction of CO2 can be facilitated by [M2L]n+ or [MM′L]n+. The binuclear [Co2L]4+ (L = 4,4′′′′-(2,7-di-tert-butyl-9,9-dimethyl-9H-xanthene-4,5-diyl) di-2,2′:6′,2′′:6′′,2′′′-quaterpyridine) complex has been prepared and its X-ray structure is shown in Fig. 12. Interestingly, [CoCoL]4+ is capable of controlling the selectivity of HCOO−versus CO production in the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 through the synergism between the two Co atoms as well as co-substrates. In acetonitrile solution containing 20% triethylamine, a maximum selectivity of 97% for HCOO− is obtained using Ru(phen)3Cl2 (phen = 1,10-phenanthroline, Fig. 11) as photosensitizer and BIH as sacrificial donor. Conversely, CO is produced with a maximum selectivity of 99% using phenol as co-substrate. This is in contrast to the above mentioned mononuclear quaterpyridine complexes [M(qpy)(H2O)2]2+ (M = Co, Fe and Cu), where CO is the predominant product in both electrocatalytic and photocatalytic CO2 reduction.

Infrared spectroelectrochemistry (IR-SEC) indicated that the four-electron-reduced species of [CoCoL]4+ (noted as [CoCoL]) is able to bind CO2, forming a stable adduct [CoCoCO2L] with a characteristic asymmetric CO stretch at 1635 cm−1 (Fig. 13). A reasonable model of [CoCoCO2L] was obtained by DFT calculations, which has one Co centre bonded to the C atom of CO2 and the other to an O atom (Fig. 13).

Based on experimental observations and preliminary theoretical calculations (Scheme 17), a plausible mechanism is proposed as shown in Scheme 18. The catalyst [CoCoL]4+ first undergoes 4e− reduction to generate the neutral [CoCo(L)] species, which can reductively bind CO2 to form a sandwich type intermediate [CoCoCO2(L)]. [CoCoCO2(L)] then undergoes further 1e− reduction to generate the catalytically active species [CoCoCO2(L)]−, which leads to the formation of CO or HCOO−. In the presence of a weak acid, protonation of the coordinated O atom of CO2 on [CoCoCO2(L)]− occurs efficiently, which results in C–O bond cleavage and formation of CO. The C to O linkage isomerization of [CoCoCO2(L)]− has a barrier of 18.5 kcal mol−1 (Scheme 17) and may be competitive at low proton concentration. Thus rapid protonation at the basic C atom of [CoCoO2C(L)]− produces HCOO− under basic conditions (Scheme 18). An alternative pathway to formate may be due to the amine acting as an axial ligand to Co, with concomitant increase of electronic density at the C atom of CO2, which may become more basic and thus easier to protonate. Such mechanism has been recently shown to occur with Fe porphyrin as CO2 catalyst.50 Further mechanistic studies and calculations will shed light on this remarkable reactivity. Noticeably, the commercially available graphitic carbon nitride and the organic dye Pheno (Fig. 11) can also be used as photosensitizer for catalytic CO2 reduction by [CoCoL]4+.

5.4 Grafting cobalt quaterpyridine complex on carbon nitride for photocatalytic reduction of CO2
Molecular catalysts possess well-defined structures, which facilitate kinetic and mechanistic studies to get valuable mechanistic information for further designing novel and more efficient molecular catalysts. Moreover, the reactivity and selectivity of molecular catalysts can be readily tuned by systematic variation of the steric and electronic effects of the ligands. On the other hand, heterogeneous catalysts have the advantages of high stability, ease of product separation and catalyst recycling. Combining an efficient and selective molecular catalyst with a solid sensitizer material would construct a photocatalytic CO2 reduction system with high selectivity and durability. In this connection, a new molecular-hybrid material, Coqpy@mpg-C3N4, was constructed by covalently attaching Coqpy-Ph-COOH to the semi-conductive mesoporous graphitic carbon nitride (mpg-C3N4) through an amide linkage (Scheme 19).51 Upon visible light illumination of a suspension of Coqpy@mpg-C3N4 in MeCN for 4 days, CO was produced with a TON of 254 and a high selectivity (97%) using BIH as sacrificial reductant and phenol as proton donor (Scheme 20). The Coqpy@mpg-C3N4 material has excellent long-term stability; no degradation was observed over four consecutive 24 h irradiation cycles, which gives a total TON of ca. 500 and a quantum yield 0.25% for CO formation (Fig. 14). It should be noted that the structure of the metal complex and the semi-conductive material can be tuned independently. Furthermore, the electronic interaction between the metal complex and the semi-conductive material can be modulated. This research opens new routes for developing and optimizing highly active catalytic materials for the photocatalytic reduction of CO2.

5.5 Grafting cobalt quaterpyridine complex at a CIGS based photocathode
Very recently, Odobel, Barreau and Robert reported a photocathode modified with Coqpy for CO2 reduction in water at close to neutral pH 6.8 (0.1 M KHCO3, CO2 saturated solution).52 The metal complex was modified with two phosphonic acid groups and further grafted on a compact TiO2 layer covering the top of the photocathode (Scheme 21). The electrode was a p-type Cu(In,Ga)Se2 semi-conductor (CIGS, 2 μm thick), forming a p–n junction with a CdS buffer layer (ca. 40 nm) for efficient electron–hole separation upon illumination, on top of which a protective zinc oxide layer of ca. 300 nm was deposited, finally covered by TiO2 and the catalyst. Upon illumination with visible light (λ > 435 nm), the photocathode was able to convert CO2-to-CO with a selectivity of 97%, H2 being the only by-product. At a bias corresponding to zero overpotential (equilibrium thermodynamic potential for CO production), a current density of about 3 mA cm−2 was obtained, which corresponds to the most efficient molecular photo cathode for CO2 catalytic reduction so far reported, including both earth abundant and noble metal catalysts. Remarkably, at a negative overpotential of −50 mV (E = −0.06 V vs. RHE), a 2 h photoelectrolysis led to a TON of 8031 for CO (97% selectivity was maintained all along the experiment with 89% faradaic efficiency) with and average jCO = 0.81 mA cm−2. Note that the stability of the photoelectrochemical cell was not limited by the molecular catalyst but rather by the cathode instability in the aqueous solution, indicating large room for improvement of the performances.

6. Conclusions
In this tutorial, we have described the major advances in water splitting and CO2 reduction catalysed by metal quaterpyridine complexes. Detailed experimental conditions and data for the electrocatalytic and photocatalytic CO2 reduction by the various quaterpyridine complexes as well as by selected catalysts reported in the literature are provided in ESI† (Tables S1 and S2). The planar, strongly coordinating and good π-accepting properties of qpy all contribute to the unique performance of these complexes as catalysts for artificial synthesis. The catalytic properties of these complexes can be tuned by introducing various substituents on the qpy ligand. The selectivity and stability of these catalysts can be further enhanced by grafting the qpy complexes onto various conducting or semiconducting materials, as well as entrapping them into metal–organic frameworks. Reduction of CO2 beyond two electrons may be achieved by using polymetallic metal quaterpyridine catalysts, an exciting and upcoming perspective.

Key learning points
1. Quaterpyridine can stabilize metal complexes in both high and low oxidation states.
2. Metal quaterpyridine complexes are highly efficient catalysts for water splitting and CO2 reduction.
3. The Fe quaterpyridine complex can serve as a precursor catalyst for the electrochemical CO2-to-CH4 reduction.
4. The selectivity of HCOO−vs. CO production in photocatalytic reduction of CO2 can be controlled by using a binuclear Co quaterpyridine complex.
5. Combining molecular catalysts with solid materials opens new pathways for photocatalytic and photo-electrocatalytic reduction of CO2.
