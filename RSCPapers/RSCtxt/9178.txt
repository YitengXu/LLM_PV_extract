Ir(ppy)3 (Ir-0; ppy = 2-phenylpyridine) was used as reference, which gives the typical weak absorption in visible range (ε = 1.51 × 104 M−1 cm−1 M−1 cm−1 at 385 nm). The nanosecond time-resolved transient absorption and DFT calculations proposed that styryl BODIPY-localized long lived 3IL states were populated for Ir-1, Ir-2, Ir-3 and Ir-4 (τT = 106.6 μs, 156.5 μs, 92.5 μs and 31.4 μs, respectively) upon photoexcitation. The complexes were used as triplet photosensitizers for singlet oxygen (1O2) mediated photooxidation of 1,5-dihydronaphthalene to produce juglone. The 1O2 quantum yields (ΦΔ) of Ir-1 (0.53) and Ir-2 (0.81) are ca. 9-fold of Ir-3 (0.06) and 40-fold of Ir-4 (0.02), respectively. Ir-2 has high molar absorption coefficient at 664 nm, moderate fluorescence in the NIR region, and high singlet oxygen quantum yield (ΦΔ = 0.81), exhibits predominate photocytotoxicity over dark cytotoxicity in LLC cells (lung cancer cells) upon irradiation, making it potentially suitable for use in in vivo photodynamic therapy (PDT). Our results are useful for preparation of transition metal complexes that show strong absorption of visible light in the NIR region with long-lived triplet excited states and for the application of these complexes in photocatalysis and theranostics such as simultaneous photodynamic therapy (PDT) and luminescent bioimaging.
Introduction
In recent years, near-infrared (NIR) fluorescent probes have drawn considerable attention of chemists in view of their emerging interest for probing biochemical and biological systems since cellular and tissue imaging in the NIR wavelengths has better tissue penetration and less bioautofluorescence.1,2 On the other hand, cyclometalated Ir(III) complexes are highly appealing because of their wide range of applications in electroluminescence,3–12 luminescent molecular probes,13–22 photodynamic therapy (PDT) for bioimaging,1 photocatalysis,23 and more recently triplet–triplet annihilation (TTA) upconversion.24
In general, cyclometalated Ir(III) complexes, with short absorption wavelength, weak absorption of visible light and short-lived triplet excited states (τ, a few microseconds), are not suitable for application in the newly developed areas, such as photocatalysis,23a,25 luminescent molecular probes,15b,17,26 photodynamic therapy and TTA upconversion,24c for which strong absorption of visible light and long-lived triplet excited states are preferred.27
Concerning the theranostics application, one of the major challenges is to develop new complexes that show strong fluorescence as well as satisfactory intersystem crossing (ISC). These complexes can be used as multi-functional materials, such as photodynamic therapy and at the same time, for luminescent bioimaging. The former application is based on efficient ISC to produce triplet excited states, whereas the latter property is related to efficient radiative decay of singlet excited states. However, for normal transition metal complexes, the ISC is efficient and the luminescence is phosphorescence, thus, the luminescence is substantially dependent on molecular oxygen (O2), which may cause interference for the bioimaging. Fine-tuning the ISC to access balanced strong fluorescence with moderate ISC is difficult and very few transition metal complexes were reported as fluorescence emissive with moderate ISC efficiency.11b,18
In order to overcome the aforementioned challenge and to develop methods to access transition metal complexes showing strong visible light absorption and long-lived triplet excited states, herein we demonstrate that on attaching bulky organic fluorophores to the coordination center via a π-conjugation linker (CC triple bond),27a,28 the heavy atom effect of Ir(III) can be maximized and the excitation energy can be efficiently funnelled to the triplet excited states thus enhancing the applicability of Ir(III) complexes in photocatalysis or PDT. More importantly, the absorption as well as the emission wavelengths can be extended to the NIR spectral region.
Concerning this aspect, we have prepared four heteroleptic cyclometalated Ir(III) complexes (Ir-1, Ir-2, Ir-3 and Ir-4, Schemes 1 and 2) using BODIPY ligands to access strong absorption of NIR light through π-conjugation linkers to ensure ISC. Hence, the π-extended styryl derivatives of fluorophore, 4,4′-difluoro-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene (BODIPY), which exhibit remarkable wide-spread applications in biological labelling and cell imaging, as logic gates and ion sensors, and in dye-sensitized solar cells,29 were used for construction of the ligands. Previously it was found that extension of the ligand π-conjugation induces a strong red shift of the excitation/emission band compared to the unsubstituted complex.30 Herein, we introduced a bulky methoxyl/methyl diamino mono/di styryl BODIPY ligand via acetylide (–CC–) bonds of 2,2′-bipyridine (bpy) to access absorption/fluorescence in the NIR region, with reasonable ISC, as a result the complexes show reasonably high fluorescence quantum yields and satisfactory ISC. Thus, the complexes can be used as theranostic reagents for simultaneous luminescent imaging and the photodynamic therapy effect. These properties are exclusive for the normal transition metal complexes.
 Scheme 1  Synthesis of the ligands L1, L2, L3 and L4, the model complex Ir-0 and meso-tetraphenylporphyrin (TPP), methylene blue (MB) as standard triplet photosensitizers and compound 7 used as the standard for the fluorescence quantum yields are also presented. Reagents and conditions: (i) p-methoxybenzaldehyde (4 eq.), toluene, piperidine, AcOH, 120 °C, reflux.; (ii) p-(N,N-dimethylamino)benzaldehyde (4 eq.), toluene, piperidine, AcOH, 120 °C, reflux.; (iii) 5-ethynyl-2, 2′-bipyridine, TEA, THF, Pd(PPh3)4, CuI, Ar, 85 °C, reflux., 12 h.

To date only a few styryl aryl cyclometalated Ir(III) complexes have been reported, application of the triplet excited states and photocatalysis have not been studied,30,31 although, a BODIPY-containing a tridentate N^N^N Pt(II) styryl terpyridine complex was reported but with a short luminescence lifetime of 3–4 ns and low fluorescence quantum yield.32
Herein, for the first time we have reported the Ir(III) complexes (Ir-2, Ir-3 and Ir-4) exhibiting both excitation and emission bands in the NIR region. The photophysical properties have been studied with a steady state and time-resolved spectroscopy, and DFT calculations. Strong absorption in the NIR region (ca. ε is up to 7.89 × 104 M−1 cm−1 at 729 nm) and a long-lived triplet excited state (τ = 156.5 μs) were observed, which are unprecedented for Ir(III) complexes. Furthermore, the complexes show strong fluorescence (ΦF is up to 39.9%), as well as moderate ISC property (singlet oxygen quantum yield is up to ΦΔ = 81%). We also find that these properties are variable for the complexes. The Ir(III) complexes were used as triplet photosensitizers for singlet oxygen (1O2) mediated photooxidation and to investigate the PDT effect in LLC cells (lung cancer cells). These results are useful for designing Ir(III) complexes that show strong absorption of visible light in the NIR region and long-lived triplet excited states, and for the application of these complexes in photocatalysis, theranostics such as PDT/fluorescence bioimaging and non-linear optics.

Analytical measurements

1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker 400 and 100 MHz spectrophotometer, respectively (CDCl3 or CD2Cl2 as solvent, TMS as standard, δ = 0.00 ppm). High resolution mass spectra (HRMS) were determined on a MALDI TOF micro MX spectrometer. Elemental analysis was carried out with a VarioEL III Element analyzer (Elementar, Germany) and was in agreement with the calculated values within ±0.4%. Fluorescence spectra were measured on a RF-5301PC spectrofluorometer (Shimadzu). Fluorescence quantum yields were measured with compound 7 as standard (ΦF = 9.3% in toluene).36 Phosphorescence quantum yields were measured with Ru(dmb)3[PF6]2 as standard (ΦP = 7.3% in deaerated CH3CN, dmb = 4,4′-dimethyl-2,2′-bipyridine). Fluorescence lifetimes were measured with an OB920 luminescence lifetime spectrometer (Edinburgh, UK). Absorption spectra were recorded on an Agilent 8453A UV/Vis spectrophotometer. The nanosecond time-resolved transient difference absorption spectra were recorded on a LP 920 laser flash photolysis spectrometer (Edinburgh Instruments, Livingston, UK). The sample solutions were purged with N2 for 15 min before measurement. The samples were excited with a 355 or 532 nm nanosecond pulsed laser, and the transient signals were recorded on a Tektronix TDS 3012B oscilloscope. The lifetime values (by monitoring the decay traces of the transients) were obtained with the LP920 software.
DFT calculations
The density functional theory (DFT) calculations were used for optimization of both singlet states and triplet states. The UV-Vis absorption and the energy level of the T1 state were calculated with the time dependent DFT (TDDFT), based on the optimized singlet ground state geometries (S0 state). The spin density surfaces of the complexes were calculated based on the optimized triplet states. All the calculations were performed at the B3LYP/GENECP/LANL2DZ or M062X/GENECP/LANL2DZ level with Gaussian 09W.37 Toluene was used as the solvent for the calculations (CPCM model).
Photooxidation
10 mL CH2Cl2–MeOH (9/1, v/v) solution containing 1,5-dihydronaphthalene (DHN, 2.0 × 10−4 M) and a photosensitizer (2.0 × 10−5 M) was placed in a round-bottom flask and was irradiated by a 35 W xenon lamp through a 0.72 M NaNO2 solution to cut off the light with a wavelength shorter than 385 nm. At intervals of 2–5 min, 2 mL of the mixture was sampled for the UV/Vis absorption measurement and was put back immediately after recording the absorption spectra, and UV/Vis absorption spectra were recorded using the Agilent 8453 UV/Vis spectrophotometer. The power density was tuned to 20 mW cm−2 and was measured with a solar power meter. The DHN consumption was monitored by a decrease in the absorption at 301 nm, the concentration of DHN was calculated by using its molar absorption coefficient (ε = 7664 M−1 cm−1) at 301 nm. The juglone production was monitored by an increase in the absorption at 427 nm, the concentration of juglone was calculated by using its molar absorption coefficient (ε = 3811 M−1 cm−1), and the yield of juglone was obtained by dividing the concentration of juglone with the initial concentration of DHN.
Singlet oxygen (1O2) quantum yields (ΦΔ)

Φ
Δ values of the triplet photosensitizers were measured according to a modified literature method,38 with MB (ΦΔ = 0.57 in dichloromethane) as standard.39 Quantum yields for singlet oxygen generation in CH2Cl2 were determined by monitoring the photooxidation of 1,3-diphenylisobenzofuran (DPBF) sensitized by the iridium complexes. 1,3-Diphenylisobenzofuran (DPBF) was used as the 1O2 scavenger, due to its fast reaction with 1O2. The absorbance of DPBF was adjusted to around 1.0 at 414 nm in air saturated CH2Cl2. Then, the photosensitizer was added to cuvette and photosensitizer's absorbance was adjusted to around 0.2–0.3. Then, the cuvette was exposed to monochromatic light at the specific wavelength for 10 seconds depending on the efficiency of the triplet photosensitizers. The photosensitizer and MB were irradiated with the same wavelength. Absorbance was measured six times after each irradiation. Then, the slopes of the curves of absorbance maxima of DPBF at 414 nm versus irradiation time for each photosensitizer were calculated. Singlet oxygen quantum yields (ΦΔ) were calculated according to the equation (eqn (1)): (1)where “sam” and “std” designate the “Ir(III) photosensitizers” and “MB”, respectively. “m” is the slope of difference in change in absorbance of DPBF (at 414 nm) with the irradiation time, “F” is the absorption correction factor, which is given by F = 1 − 10−OD (OD is the absorbance at the irradiation wavelength).
Cell culture
LLC cells (lung cancer cells) were maintained at a density of 1.0 × 106 cells per mL for confocal imaging in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI)-1640 Medium supplemented with Foetal Bovine Serum (FBS) (10%) and penicillin (100 U mL−1 culture medium), streptomycin (100 μg mL−1 culture medium), NaHCO3 (2 g L−1), and 1% antibiotics (penicillin–streptomycin, 100 U mL−1). Cultures were grown in a humidified incubator at 37 °C, 5% CO2, and 95% relative humidity. Similarly, 1121 cells were cultured.
For trypan blue staining, exponentially growing, LLC cells were seeded at a density of 1.0 × 106 cells per well, in triplicate, and 24 h later they were treated with different concentrations (1 μM, 10 μM and 20 μM) of Ir(III) complexes in DMSO as individual entities, at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere for the below mentioned time periods. Then, cells were kept either in the dark or were illuminated with a 635 nm LED for a period of 4 h at 37 °C in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2. To evaluate the cell viability of the dye, wells that had been irradiated for 4 h were incubated in the dark for a further 24 h. Untreated LLC cells were used as controls. As controls, plates kept in the dark for 4 h were also incubated for an additional 24 h. After the appropriate incubation period, the medium was removed and the cells were washed with PBS for three times, prior to cell imaging. Confocal fluorescence imaging studies were performed on a Nikon ECLIPSE-Ti confocal laser scanning microscope.
To study the cell death induced by Ir(III) complexes upon PDT treatment on LLC cells, after the appropriate incubation period, the medium of each well was collected, rinsed with PBS for three times, and trypsinized followed by centrifugation. The cells were re-suspended, collected and mixed with the same volume of 0.4% trypan blue solution. Cells were allowed to stand from 5 to 15 min. The viable (unstained) and dead (stained) cells was visualised with a light microscope. All compounds used were prepared as a stock in DMSO, immediately before use.
Results and discussion
Design and synthesis of the complexes
Our strategy for the formation of heteroleptic Ir(III) centred complexes containing 2,2′-bipyridine based ligands has been rationalized on the fact to maximize the heavy atom effect exerted by Ir(III) on the styryl BODIPY ligand. A π-conjugation linker was used, a typical strategy to access strong visible light-absorption, long-lived triplet excited states and efficient ISC in transition metal complexes.40,41 The styryl BODIPY and its respective bulky ligand have been introduced to extend the UV-Vis absorption wavelength and fluorescence emission to the NIR region, respectively.30 Initially, the Knoevenagel condensation reaction of 2-iodo BODIPY with p-methoxybenzaldehyde was carried out, which regioselectively at the 5-position of the BODIPY moiety led to the formation of 5-monostyryl BODIPY derivative 3 as the major product along with 3,5-distyryl BODIPY derivative 4 as the minor product (Scheme 1). The molecular structure of both the derivatives 3 and 4, thus isolated by column chromatography were confirmed by 1H NMR and 2D COSY NMR, in particular by the shift in the peak due to the β-pyrrolic proton at the 6-position of the BODIPY from δ 6.0 to ca. 6.6 ppm, due to the formation of the styryl group at the 5-substitution position. The data were consistent with those of previously reported mono42–45 and distyryl BODIPY dyes.29c,46 Similarly, 5-monostyryl BODIPY derivative 5 and 3,5-distyryl BODIPY derivative 6 were synthesized and characterized (Scheme 1).
Pd(0)-catalyzed Sonogashira coupling reactions of 2-iodo styryl BODIPY derivatives and 5-ethynyl-2,2′-bipyridine were carried out to form bulky π-extended styryl BODIPY ligands (Scheme 1) to enhance UV-Visible absorption wavelength and fluorescence emission of the Ir(III) centred complexes. Ir(III) complexes were synthesized from the bis(pyridylphenyl)-iridium(III) dichloride intermediate (Scheme 2).59Ir-0 was prepared as the model complex for photophysical studies. All the complexes were obtained with moderate to satisfactory yields.
UV-Vis absorption spectra of the complexes
The UV-Vis absorption of the styryl BODIPY ligands and Ir(III) complexes were studied (Fig. 1). Styryl BODIPY based ligands L1, L2, L3 and L4 exhibited intense absorption maxima at 605 nm (ε = 1.03 × 105 M−1 cm−1), 666 nm (ε = 1.13 × 105 M−1 cm−1), 639 nm (ε = 1.23 × 105 M−1 cm−1) and 723 nm (ε = 6.89 × 104 M−1 cm−1), respectively in UV-Vis absorption (Fig. 1a). UV-Vis absorption spectra of the model complex Ir-0 showed maxima for the typical cyclometalated Ir(III) complex in the UV range (ε = 4.98 × 104 M−1 cm−1 at 284 nm) and a very weak absorption in the visible-light range (ε = 1.51 × 104 M−1 cm−1 at 385 nm) (Fig. 1b).15,47

In contrast, styryl BODIPY based heteroleptic cyclometalated Ir(III) complexes displayed strong absorption maxima at 606 nm (ε = 1.14 × 105 M−1 cm−1) for Ir-1, and in the NIR region at 664 nm (ε = 8.96 × 104 M−1 cm−1), 644 nm (ε = 9.89 × 104 M−1 cm−1) and 729 nm (ε = 7.89 × 104 M−1 cm−1) for Ir-2, Ir-3 and Ir-4, respectively (Fig. 1b). No significant wavelength shift upon complexation with Ir(III) was observed. This demonstrates that the molecular orbitals of the ligands remained unaltered to a large extent on complexation. From the absorption of the ligands and complexes, it was observed that distyryl BODIPY induced ca. 58 nm (for methoxy substituent) and ca. 85 nm (for dimethyl amino substituent) of red shifts for the respective ligands and complexes as compared to the respective monostyryl BODIPY, owing to a more intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) effect due to the large extended π conjugation in distyryl in comparison to monostyryl. Approximately, 38 nm and 65 nm of red shifts for the absorption of ligands and complexes were observed in the case of methoxy monostyryl BODIPY compared to amino dimethyl monostyryl BODIPY. Similar changes were observed for methoxy distyryl BODIPY vs. amino dimethyl distyryl BODIPY. This red shift is due to the more significant intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) in styryl BODIPY ligands and complexes with a dimethyl amino group. The characteristic absorption spectrum together with the excitation and emission spectra of complexes Ir-1, Ir-2, Ir-3 and Ir-4 are shown in Fig. 2.

The luminescence spectra of the compounds
The photoluminescence of the compounds was studied (Fig. 3). The ligands L1, L2, L3 and L4 give strong fluorescence in the NIR region at 625 nm (ΦF = 68.6%), 684 nm (ΦF = 35.6%), 674 nm (ΦF = 24.5%) and 758 nm (ΦF = 10.3%), respectively (Fig. 3a and Fig S43†). The dual emission was observed for L2 at 684 nm and 619 nm and for L4 at 758 nm and 659 nm. A similar trend was observed for the complexes with fluorescence quantum yields (ΦF) of 39.9%, 13.2%, 32.6% and 1.0% for Ir-1, Ir-2, Ir-3 and Ir-4, respectively (Fig. 3b and Table 3). The appearance of two emission peaks can be attributed to the S2 emission of the chromophores, presumably due to a Franck Condon barrier for the internal conversion of S2 → S1. Another possible origin for the minor emission shoulder at higher energy side of the emission band is due to the vibrational structure of the luminescence. Both the peaks exhibit similar behaviour on increasing the concentration (see ESI, Fig. S49b and S49d†) and on varying the excitation wavelength (Fig. S50b and S50d†) suggesting that the two emission peaks are from the same species.

Intramolecular charge transfer was proved by the concentration-dependent and excitation-energy dependence behaviour of emission spectra of Ir-2 and Ir-4. Due to the large ICT effect in the distyryl group and styryl BODIPY with an amino substituent, the emission was red shifted for distyryl and dimethyl amino styryl BODIPY ligands and complexes as compared to that of monostyryl and styryl BODIPY with a methoxy group, respectively (Fig. 4 and S43†).
 Fig. 4  Comparison of the emission intensities of the complexes: (a) Ir-1 and Ir-3, λex = 496 nm and (b) Ir-2 and Ir-4, λex = 546 nm. c = 1 × 10−5 M in toluene. 20 °C. 
In contrast to ligands, the complexes show weaker fluorescence (Fig. 5). The fluorescence emission of the ligands was remarkably quenched in the complexes which indicated efficient intersystem crossing (ISC) from the singlet excited states to the triplet excited states of the complexes upon visible light photoexcitation.35 ISC is weaker in Ir-2. Such a result is rarely observed for cyclometalated Ir(III) complexes, e.g. in an Ir(III) coordination center with a BODIPY fluorophore, the fluorescence emission of the BODIPY could not be completely quenched rather, the phosphorescence of the Ir(III) coordination center was quenched instead.48 Thus, the ISC in Ir-1 to Ir-4 may have been arouse due to the direct association of the π-core of the styryl BODIPY fluorophore to the Ir(III) coordination centres, which was not the case for some of the previous Ir(III) complexes that contained a bulky organic chromophore.11b,35,48Ir-1, Ir-2, Ir-3 and Ir-4 were not sensitive to O2, thus exhibits no phosphorescence (see ESI, Fig. S42†). The model complex Ir-0 gave a structureless intense emission band at 507 nm and the emission can be significantly quenched by O2. The structureless intense emission indicates that the emission is from a 3MLCT excited state.

Solvent-dependency of the UV-Vis absorption and the luminescence spectra of the complexes
The study of the solvent dependency of the complexes was carried out with the intention to study the properties of the emissive excited state of the complexes. The UV-Vis absorption of Ir-1, Ir-2, Ir-3, and Ir-4 (Fig. 6 & S45†) along with the respective ligands (Fig. S44 & S45†) does not show significant solvent dependency, indicating that the ground states were not affected by the solvent polarity or hydrogen bonding. We noted that the complexes are soluble in aqueous solution (MeOH–H2O, 8:2, v/v).
 Fig. 6  Solvent-polarity-dependence of the absorption of the complexes (a) Ir-1 and (b) Ir-3. c = 1.0 × 10−5 M. 20 °C. 
On comparison, the emissions of the complexes are more sensitive to the polarity of the solvents (Fig. 7 and S48†). For Ir-1 and Ir-2, the emission intensity is slightly increased in solvents with high polarity and displayed hypsochromic shift with increasing solvent polarity. This distinctive property for Ir-1 and Ir-2 may be attributed to the decreased energy gap between ground and excited states with increased possibility of transition on increasing the polarity. In contrast, bathochromic shift was observed in the case of amino dimethyl substituted complexes Ir-3 and Ir-4 and the respective emission intensity is completely quenched in high polar solvents, thus suggesting the activation of the non-emissive decay channel in high polar solvents. Energy gap law may also play a role in this change of the fluorescence quantum yield. Based on these results, we propose that the emission of the complexes is influenced by the polarity of the solvents and amino dimethyl styryl BODIPY Ir(III) complexes have more significant ICT than the methoxyl styryl BODIPY in high polar solvents. These results were further supported by the increased fluorescence quantum yield and life time with increasing solvent polarity for Ir-1 and Ir-2 whereas these were decreased in the case of Ir-3 and Ir-4. For Ir-0 no considerable effect was observed towards solvent polarity.

The absorption and emission spectra of Ir-1, Ir-2, Ir-3 and Ir-4 are shown in (Fig. 2) and Stokes shifts are tabulated in Table 3. Stokes shifts (Δst) were found to be higher for Ir-3 and Ir-4 compared to Ir-1 and Ir-2, respectively.

The nanosecond time-resolved transient difference absorption spectra of the complexes were studied so as to investigate the triplet excited states of the complexes (Fig. 8, see ESI Fig. S51–S53†). Upon 532 nm pulsed laser excitation, positive transient absorption (TA) bands at 374 and 665 nm were observed for Ir-1 (Fig. 8a) along with the bleaching bands at 429 nm and 600 nm due to the UV-Vis absorption (Fig. 1b). Based on these results, we conclude that the triplet excited state of Ir-1 is localized on the styryl BODIPY ligand, not on the Ir(III) coordination center. The transient signal was quenched in aerated solution, which proves the triplet feature of the transients. The lifetime of the triplet excited state was determined to be 106.6 μs.

Similarly, upon 532 nm photoexcitation, the bleaching band at 662 nm was observed for Ir-2 (Fig. 8c) which is also consistent with the UV-Vis absorption spectra (Fig. 1b). This implies that the triplet excited state of Ir-2 is also localized on the styryl BODIPY ligand and not on the Ir(III) coordination center. The lifetime of the triplet excited state was determined to be 156.5 μs for Ir-2 which was also found to be quenched in aerated solution. The transient absorption spectrum of Ir-3 (see ESI, Fig. S51†) was found to be similar to that of Ir-1, with a slightly blue-shifted bleaching band at 632 nm and positive transient absorption bands at about 408 nm and 760 nm. The lifetime of the transient was determined to be 92.5 μs. To the best of our knowledge, these values are the longest triplet state lifetimes observed for the styryl BODIPY group in transition metal complexes.32 The lifetime of the triplet excited state for Ir-4 was found to be 31.4 μs. These 3IL state lifetime values are close to those of Styryl BODIPY-C60 Dyads (105.6 μs/123.2 μs)49 but much longer than that observed for the iodo-styryl BODIPY (4 μs).36 Previously the triplet excited state lifetimes of the BODIPY-containing Ir(III) complexes were reported as 87.2 μs.28b
In disagreement to Ir-1, Ir-2, Ir-3 and Ir-4, a notably different transient profile was observed for Ir-0 with a transient absorption band at 320 nm along with a bleaching band at 525 nm due to the strong phosphorescence emission (see ESI Fig. S51d†). The lifetime of the triplet excited state for Ir-0 was found to be 1.34 μs. Thus, Ir-0 was distinguished in the 3MLCT state.
DFT calculations: assignment of the excited states
From a theoretical perspective, the photophysical properties of transition metal complexes were studied by density functional theory (DFT) calculations.27a,41i,50 In order to study the lowest-lying triplet excited states of the complexes, the localization of spin density surfaces of the complexes were studied.24d,27a,28a,41i,51 The spin density surfaces of complexes Ir-1–Ir-4 are exclusively localized on the styryl BODIPY moieties (Fig. 9), the Ir(III) centres made no contribution suggesting that the triplet states are in the 3IL state of the respective complexes, which is in full agreement with the nanosecond time-resolved transient absorption of the complexes.24d,28,50e,52 However, the spin density surface of Ir-0 is distributed on the ppy ligand as well as on the Ir(III) coordination center. Thus, this result was in agreement with the LLCT/MLCT assignment of Ir-0.

The ground state geometries of the complexes were optimized. Slightly distorted conformations were observed for styryl BODIPY moieties (Fig. 10, 11, and S54†). The deviation from the coplanar geometry is more significant for Ir-4 (Fig. S55†).

 Fig. 11  Electron density maps of the frontier molecular orbitals of complex Ir-2. Based on the ground state optimized geometry by the DFT calculations at the B3LYP/LANL2DZ level with Gaussian 09W. 
The UV-Vis absorption of the complexes was calculated based on the optimized ground state geometry (Franck–Condon principle).53,54 The calculated UV-Vis absorption band of Ir-1 is at 643 nm (1.93 eV), which is close to the experimental result at 606 nm (2.05 eV. Fig. 1b). The main transition for this absorption band is HOMO → LUMO. Based on the molecular orbitals in the low-lying singlet excited states of this transition, it is clear that this transition is styryl BODIPY ligand localized transition (Fig. 10), which is in agreement with the experimental results. The energy gap between the ground state (S0) and the triplet excited states (T1) of Ir-1 calculated by the TDDFT is predicted as 1.23 eV. The molecular orbitals involved in the transitions of T1 states are mainly localized styryl BODIPY ligands (Fig. 10 and Table 1). Therefore, the T1 state can be identified as the 3IL state, which is in agreement with the spin density analysis and the transient absorption studies.27a

Similar calculations were carried out for Ir-2. The calculated absorption band is at 738 nm (1.68 eV), which is longer than the experimental results (1.87 eV, 664 nm, Fig. 1b). Molecular orbitals of HOMO → LUMO are involved in this S0 → S1 transition (Fig. 11 and Table 2). These molecular orbitals are also styryl BODIPY ligand localized, which is in agreement with the UV-Vis absorption spectra (Fig. 1b). The S0 → T1 energy gap was estimated with the TDDFT method as 1.10 eV. Since the major component of the S0 → T1 state is HOMO → LUMO+1, the T1 state can be identified as the 3IL state since the molecular orbitals are localized on the styryl BODIPY ligand. This result is also in agreement with the spin density analysis and the transient absorption spectroscopy (Fig. 11 and Table 1). For Ir-3 (see ESI, Fig. S54 and Table S2†) and Ir-4 (see ESI, Fig. S55 and Table S3†) also, analogous calculations were carried out; the results are similar to those of Ir-1 and Ir-2. The S0 → T1 energy gaps, calculated with the TDDFT method were found to be 1.14 eV and 1.02 eV for Ir-3 and Ir-4, respectively. For both the complexes Ir-3 and Ir-43IL states were also identified for T1 states.

The excitations of Ir-0 were also studied by TDDFT calculations. The calculated UV-Vis absorption band was at 387 nm which is in agreement with the experimental results (385 nm). The Ir(III) atom and ppy ligands contributed to the transitions, could be assigned as MLCT or LLCT transitions (see ESI, Fig. S56 and Table S4†). The S0 → T1 energy gap was found to be 2.64 eV (470 nm, 2.64 eV), which was in good agreement with the observed RT phosphorescence emission at 507 nm (2.45 eV) indicating that the T1 state could be assigned as LLCT or MLCT (see ESI, Fig. S56 and Table S4†). These parameters are comparable to the experimental results of the complexes (Table 3).

Photosensitization of singlet oxygen (1O2): photoxidation with the complexes as a triplet photosensitizer
As the complexes show strong absorption of visible light and long-lived triplet excited states (Table 3), these are applicable in photocatalysis as a singlet oxygen (1O2) photosensitizer. Herein, the 1O2 photosensitizing ability of the complexes as triplet photosensitizers were studied with visible light photooxidation using DHN as the 1O2 scavenger to follow the kinetics of the 1O2 production of the triplet photosensitizers. The photooxidation product juglone thus formed can be used for preparation of anti-cancer compounds.55 The conventional triplet photosensitizers meso-tetraphenylporphyrin (TPP) and methylene blue (MB) were studied for comparison. The consumption of DHN can be monitored by the decrease in its absorption at 301 nm signifying the progress of 1O2 photosensitizing with Ir(III).49,56
The UV-Vis absorption spectra of the mixture were monitored (Fig. 12 and S57†). The more efficient changes were found for Ir-2 than other complexes. However, for Ir-1, the decrease of the DHN absorption at 301 nm occurs at a much lesser extent than that of Ir-2. The absorption of all the complexes in the visible region did not change upon continuous irradiation, therefore the photostability of the complexes is good. Significant changes were found for TPP and MB (Fig. S57b and S57c†).
 Fig. 12  UV-Vis absorption spectral change for DHN using complex (a) Ir-1, (b) Ir-2, (c) Ir-4, and (d) Ir-0 as photosensitizers. Irradiated with a 35 W xenon lamp (20 mW cm−2 in the photoreactor; the UV light with a wavelength shorter than 385 nm was blocked by 0.72 M NaNO2 solution). In CH2Cl2–CH3OH (9:1, v/v); c [DHN] = 2.0 × 10−4 M; c [photosensitizer] = 2.0 × 10−5M; 20 °C. 
The photooxidation velocities with Ir(III) complexes as the triplet photosensitizers were compared with MB and TPP by plotting the ln(Ct/C0) against the irradiation time (Fig. 13a). The larger the slope of the plot, the more efficient the 1O2 photosensitizing ability. Ir-2 is more efficient than MB (ΦΔ = 65%).57Ir-3 and Ir-0 show much weaker 1O2 photosensitizing ability. Ir-0 shows weaker 1O2 photosensitizing ability due to the lack of visible light-harvesting. Ir-4 is the photosensitizer that gives the poorest performance. The parameters related to photooxidation of DHN using the Ir(III) complexes, MB and TPP are summarized in Table 4. Ir-1 and Ir-2 show ΦΔ values of 53% and 81%, respectively, thus these complexes are efficient 1O2 photosensitizers. The absorption of Ir-2 in the visible region is much stronger than that of Ir-1, therefore the 1O2 photosensitizing ability of Ir-2 is much more efficient than Ir-1. Ir-3 and Ir-4 show a very low yield of 6% and 2%, respectively, which may be responsible for the poor 1O2 photoxidation ability of Ir-3 and Ir-4. Ir-2 as a photosensitizer on photoirradiation for 40 min, yielded 91% of juglone, which is higher than the other Ir(III) complexes and MB (Fig. 13a and Table 4). Ir-4 yielded only 41% of juglone due to low singlet oxygen quantum yield (ΦΔ). It should be pointed out that the photooxidation of the complexes are dependent on the intrinsic properties of the triplet photosensitizers (such as the light-harvesting ability and the triplet state lifetimes), but it is also strongly dependent on the match between the absorption spectra of the photosensitizers and the emission spectra of the excitation lamp. The comparison of the absorption spectra of photosensitizers and the emission of excitation lamp was carried out (see ESI, Fig. S57d†). The excitation lamp gives broad emission spectra (not monochromatic light), and there is a good agreement between the absorption spectra of the triplet photosensitizers and the emission spectra. Therefore, the comparison of the photooxidation of the Ir-1, Ir-2, Ir-3, Ir-4 and the model triplet photosensitizers is reliable: the relative photooxidation ability of the complexes are directly related to the light-absorbing and the triplet excited state lives of the triplet photosensitizers.

Fluorescent imaging and intracellular PDT studies
The complexes show fluorescence and intersystem crossing. As a result, the luminescence is independent of oxygen (O2), and singlet oxygen (1O2) can be produced upon photoexcitation. Therefore, these complexes can be used as multi-functional materials. Since, the singlet oxygen quantum yield of Ir-2 is high, we have explored the cytotoxicity of Ir(III) complexes in LLC cells (lung cancer cells) both in the presence and in the absence of light to investigate the photodynamic therapy (PDT) effect of the complexes. PDT being an non-invasive and attractive protocol in the treatment of a variety of cancer cells by the combined use of near IR or visible light with a photosensitizing drug, has been used to form intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) to kill cells and to stimulate the immune response. No IR absorbing Ir(III) complexes have been reported for application in PDT studies.59,60
The cells were treated with 10 μM Ir(III) complexes and were kept either in the dark or were illuminated with a 635 nm LED. To ascertain the cellular uptake of the photosensitizers, incubated cells were imaged using a confocal fluorescence microscope (Fig. 14, S58–S60†). Ir-1–Ir-3 exhibits a red fluorescence signal (λex = 543 nm). The overlay of fluorescence and bright field images, confirm the good cellular permeability of the photosensitizers. In contrast, cellular uptake of Ir-4 was poor in the absence of light. As a control the cells were incubated in the absence of light and also in the absence of sensitizers. No fluorescence was observed in the respective controls (Fig. 14a and b).

(a) Cells in control on incubation in the dark for 24 h; (b) cells in control on irradiation for 4 hours by a 635 nm LED followed by further incubation in the dark for 24 h; (c) Ir-2 (10 μM) treated cells in the dark for 24 h and (d) Ir-2 (10 μM) treated cells on irradiation for 4 hours by a 635 nm LED followed by further incubation in the dark for 24 h. 
The effect of Ir(III) complexes for cell viability was investigated both in the presence and in the absence of light using trypan blue staining (Fig. 15 and Fig. S61–S64†).58 Trypan blue is one of the dye exclusion procedures for viable cell counting. This method is based on the principle that live (viable) cells do not take up certain dyes, whereas dead (nonviable) cells do. Since cells are very selective to the compound that penetrates through the cell membrane in a viable cell, trypan blue is not absorbed and hence, live cells with undamaged cell membranes are not colored. However, it traverses the membrane of the dead cell and binds to several intracellular proteins, staining the cell blue. Therefore, dead cells are shown to be a distinctive blue color or dark black at the center of the cell as per the background of the image under a light microscope, and living cells are excluded from staining.

Phototoxicity with different concentrations of the Ir-complexes (1 μM, 10 μM, 20 μM), and different optical doses (1 h, 3 h) was studied. The results show that with increasing the complexes concentration or optical doses, the PDT effect become more significant, especially with increasing the complex concentration (see ESI, Fig. 14, S58, and S59 for detail†).
The PDT effect of TPP (tetraphenylporphyrin) under the same condition was studied.61 The trypan blue staining experiments show that the PDT effect of our Ir-complexes is more significant than TPP (see ESI Fig. S61–S63 and S66 for detail†). The reason may be due to the stronger absorption of the Ir-complexes in the visible spectral region as compared with that of TPP. Note that the absorption of porphyrins in the visible spectral region is actually weak (the most intense absorption of porphyrin is at ca. 400 nm).
The 1O2 production of the complexes in aqueous solution was studied (see ESI Table S1†). Aqueous solvent MeOH–H2O (4:1, v/v) and protic solvent MeOH were used. Ir-1 and Ir-2 show ΦΔ values of 70% and 35%, respectively. However, Ir-3 and Ir-4 show no 1O2 production (see ESI Table S1†). These results are in agreement with the PDT studies as discussed above. The failure of Ir-3 and Ir-4 to produce 1O2 in aqueous solution may be due to the quenching of the triplet states of Ir-3 and Ir-4 by the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT).
IC50 values of the complexes in the absence of LED illumination were studied (Table 5). 1121 and LLC cell lines were cultured as described in the main manuscript. The IC50 values of Ir-1 and Ir-2 for different concentrations of 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 25 μM in cells were investigated both in the absence and in the presence of light for 36 h using the MTT assay.62 Cells were incubated with different concentrations 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 25 μM of Ir-1 and Ir-2 for 36 h. IC50 values for Ir-1 on photoirradiation and in the dark were found to be 2.58 and 9.81 μM, respectively for 1121 cell lines. For LLC cell lines the respective values were 6.18 and 8.16 μM. Similarly, IC50 values for Ir-2 on photoirradiation and in the absence of photoirradiation were found to be 7.68 and 16.70 μM, respectively for 1121 cell lines and for LLC cell lines the values were 9.80 and 15.63 μM, respectively.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we prepared four styryl-BODIPY-containing heteroleptic C^N Ir(III) complexes which show strong NIR absorption (644–729 nm), strong NIR fluorescence (700–800 nm), and long-lived triplet excited states (92.5–156.5 μs). In these complexes the π-conjugation framework of the ligands were connected to the Ir(III) coordination center via the CC bond, with the aim to induce efficient ISC. The photophysical properties of the complexes and the NIR light-harvesting ligands were studied with the steady state and time-resolved absorption/emission spectroscopy, as well as DFT calculations. We found that the complexes are strongly fluorescent, although the π-conjugation is present between the BODIPY ligands and the Ir(III) coordination center. Moderate intersystem crossing (ISC) was observed for the complexes, proved by the population of the long-lived intraligand triplet excited state (3IL) and the 1O2 photosensitizing property. Based on the property of NIR absorption/fluorescence and the reasonable 1O2 quantum yield, the complexes were used as multi-functional materials as luminescent bioimaging reagents and in intracellular photodynamic studies. Our results are useful for preparation of NIR-absorbing cyclometalated Ir(III) complexes, and the relevant application of these complexes as multi-functional materials such as a luminescent bioimaging reagent, in PDT and photocatalysis, etc.
