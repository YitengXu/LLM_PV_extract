1. Introduction
Energy is the basis for human survival and is one of the driving forces of social development.1–5 At present, the global energy structure faces a transition from fossil energy to renewable energy.6–8 Renewable solar energy is an essential source of other energies, such as wind, ocean, thermal and biomass energies. Compared with the commonly used fossil energy, solar energy is safe, abundant and clean.9 Thus, employing solar energy can accelerate the transformation of the global energy structure.10 However, solar energy is challenging to collect, and its density exhibits intermittent fluctuations with seasonal, weather and diurnal variabilities.11 Therefore, solar energy must be converted into high-density, readily available, and stable energy forms, such as chemical energy, to facilitate its efficient utilisation.
In nature, plants absorb sunlight to produce organics. On this basis, researchers developed artificial photosynthesis, a photocatalyst-based solar-to-chemical energy conversion.12–14 Artificial photosynthesis consists of four main processes: (1) the photocatalyst absorbs high-energy photons from sunlight and produces electron–hole pairs. (2) The photogenerated electron–hole pairs separate and transfer. (3) Some photogenerated electrons and holes are annihilated by Coulomb forces or captured by traps. (4) The photogenerated carriers that survive and reach the photocatalyst surface participate in redox reactions to achieve chemical bond formation. Thus, the chemical products converted are known as solar fuels.15,16 Artificial photosynthesis is entirely driven by sunlight and is safe and pollution-free.17,18 Therefore, photocatalysis is promising in realising solar-to-chemical energy conversion.
In recent years, various photocatalytic materials have emerged in an endless stream.19–23 As nonmetallic materials, carbon-based materials contribute to the sustainable development of energy conversion.24 Amongst these carbon-based materials, the emerging graphdiyne, a metal-free 2D carbon allotrope after fullerenes, carbon nanotubes, and graphene, has attracted great attention.25–27 As early as 1987, graphdiyne was predicted to be highly sp-hybridised.28 Subsequently, graphdiyne was first prepared by using a hexaethynylbenzene (HEB) precursor in 2010,29 which opened the prelude of graphdiyne research. Graphdiyne has the advantages of tunable bandgaps, outstanding electrical conductivity, and high chemical stability. The 2D planar structure of graphdiyne makes it a good support for the construction of graphdiyne-based composites.30,31 Therefore, graphdiyne-based photocatalysts have been widely reported in solar fuel production.32 The development of graphdiyne-based photocatalysts has enabled continuous progress in solar fuel production.33 Considering the rapid expansion and development of graphdiyne-based photocatalysts, we review the recent achievements of graphdiyne-based photocatalysts for solar fuel production. This paper summarises the structure, properties, synthesis and characterisation of graphdiyne and its application in solar fuel production, including H2 evolution, CO2 reduction and N2 fixation. This paper provides the challenges and opportunities for graphdiyne-based photocatalysts in solar fuel production.
2. Structure and properties of graphdiyne
Various carbon allotropes with sp2 or sp3 hybrid configurations have been found.34–37 The undiscovered sp-hybridised carbon allotrope was mysterious until graphdiyne was synthesised using HEB by Li et al. in 2010.29 The unique high π-conjugation structure of graphdiyne endows it with uniform nanopore distribution, nonuniform electron distribution, excellent electrical conductivity and electron mobility, tunable bandgaps, and high chemical stability (Fig. 1).38,39 These attractive properties make graphdiyne a promising candidate for photocatalytic solar fuel production.
 Fig. 1  Main properties of graphdiyne. 
As shown in Fig. 2, the graphyne family has various structural forms. The different ratios of acetylenic bonds and benzene rings and the diversity of connection modes between them result in a variety of structures in the graphyne family. α-, β-, γ-, 6,6,12- and rhombic-graphynes are also found.40 Amongst them, graphdiyne is the most stable structure.28 The optimised primitive cell of graphdiyne (space group P6/MMM) possesses the lattice parameters a, b, c and θ of 9.38 Å, 9.38 Å, 3.63 Å and 120°, respectively.41–43 The 2D topological planar structure of graphdiyne results in uniformly distributed nanopores, where their diameter is determined to be 5.42 Å by theoretical calculations. These nanopores promote the accessibility of active sites, efficient mass transfer, and the anchoring of metal ions.
 Fig. 2  Molecular structures of (a) graphyne, (b) graphdiyne, (c) graphtriyne and (d) graphyne-n. 
The carbon–carbon bonds in graphdiyne can be divided into four categories: (1) aromatic Csp2–Csp2 bonds (1.41 Å); (2) CspCsp acetylenic bonds (1.24 Å); (3) Csp2–Csp bonds (1.40 Å) between a benzene ring and its adjacent acetylenic bond; and (4) a Csp–Csp bond (1.33 Å) between two neighboring acetylenic bonds.44 The diversity of carbon–carbon bonds endows graphdiyne with structural flexibility.45 For example, graphdiyne can form a graphdiyne nanotube, similar to graphene curling, to form a carbon nanotube.46 The corresponding properties change with the morphology of graphdiyne. The in-plane electron and hole mobilities of graphdiyne at room temperature are 2 × 105 and 2 × 104 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, comparable to those of graphene.47,48 The electron and hole mobility of graphdiyne decreased by one and two orders of magnitude after being transformed into nanotubes, respectively.49 Compared with planar graphdiyne, graphdiyne nanotubes are less elastic, have a smaller deformation potential constant, and exhibit weaker electron–phonon coupling. The acetylenic bonds affect the mechanical properties of the graphyne family. For instance, the Young's modulus and fracture stress of graphyne decrease with the proportion of acetylenic bonds.50 Therefore, an increase in the content of acetylenic bonds decreases the stability of graphyne.51
Theoretical calculations indicate that the graphyne family has the Dirac cone energy band structure, which was previously considered a unique graphene feature.52,53 Unlike graphene with zero bandgap, the graphyne family has natural direct bandgaps, probably due to the nonuniform π-bonding between carbon atoms with different hybrid configurations and the overlap of carbon 2pz orbitals.47,54 The bandgap of graphdiyne is theoretically predicted to be 0.44–1.10 eV, where the difference is mainly due to the different calculation methods.55 Graphdiyne has AA-, AB- and ABC-stacked structures with layer spacing of 0.85, 0.85 and 0.48 nm, respectively.56 Amongst them, the ABC-stacked graphdiyne has the highest stability.57 The number of layers and stacking mode affect the properties of graphdiyne. For example, the stable AB-stacked conformation is semiconducting, and the most unstable AA-stacked structure has metallic properties.42 The bandgaps of the most and second stable bilayer graphdiyne are 0.35 and 0.14 eV, respectively. The bandgap of graphdiyne with three layers is estimated to be 0.18–0.33 eV.41 The bandgap of graphdiyne is controllable with various methods, such as elemental doping,58 applying external strain,59 changing the morphology,60 chemical functionalisation,54 and applying an electric field.61 The bandgap and carrier mobility of graphdiyne nanoribbons decrease and increase with the increase in the nanoribbon width, respectively.47,62 With the increase in biaxial and uniaxial tensile strain, the bandgap of graphdiyne increases and decreases, respectively.63
3. Synthesis and characterisation of graphdiyne
The preparation of graphdiyne has been extensively explored after theoretical studies predicted the existence of graphdiyne.64 The obstacles to graphdiyne synthesis exist with three main aspects: (i) the free rotation of the monomer during polymerisation often leads to highly branched or cross-linked structures rather than the desired 2D periodic topology due to acetylenic bonds with no cis–trans isomers; (ii) the strong interactions between the substrate and graphdiyne cause lattice mismatch; and (iii) the step-down diffusion of monomers is hampered by the Ehrlich–Schwoebel barrier,79 leading to a vertical growth of monomers. Therefore, various advanced synthetic methods have been rapidly developed.80,81 Correspondingly, the identification and characterisation of the obtained graphdiyne materials are investigated. The preparation and characterisation of graphdiyne are discussed below.
3.1 Synthesis of graphdiyne
In accordance with the reaction environment, the currently developed synthetic methods for graphdiyne are classified into wet and dry chemistry. Wet chemistry includes direct growth on Cu substrates, interface-assisted synthesis, and solution-phase van der Waals (vdW) epitaxy. Dry chemistry includes chemical vapour deposition (CVD) and explosion methods. Table 1 summarises the various methods and reaction conditions for graphdiyne synthesis, including precursors, catalysts, reaction types and temperatures.

HEB was chosen as the precursor in the pioneering work on the synthesis of graphdiyne.29 The graphdiyne is directly grown on copper foil in an organic solvent. The copper foil serves as a substrate and acts as a catalyst. The resulting graphdiyne has a thickness of ∼970 nm. Therefore, synthesising monolayer or few-layer graphdiyne is still challenging. Yin et al.65 developed a facile interface-assisted synthesis of a few-layer graphdiyne (Fig. 3a). Sodium chloride (NaCl) and a mixed solvent of toluene and hexane are chosen as the solid substrate and liquid phase medium, respectively. The microwave-induced temperature gradient at the solid/liquid interface promotes the cross-coupling reaction of the HEB monomer because NaCl absorbs microwaves and the solvent is nonabsorbing. The prepared graphdiyne has a thickness of ∼1 nm and high crystallinity (Fig. 3b–d). The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image (Fig. 3e), corresponding simulated image (Fig. 3f), and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (Fig. 3g) reveal the periodic topology of the graphdiyne with ABC-stacked mode. Gao et al.57 synthesised ultrathin single-crystal graphdiyne on graphene by using a solution-phase vdW epitaxy. The weak vdW interactions between the graphene and monomer molecules relax the lattice mismatch between the graphdiyne epilayer and graphene. Therefore, the in-plane coupling of the adsorbed monomer is more dominant than the vertical growth.82 The synthesised graphdiyne is stacked in an ABC pattern with a three-layer structure observed by HRTEM. This vdW epitaxy provides a versatile synthetic route to ultrathin graphdiyne.

Liu and his coworkers prepared graphdiyne via CVD (Fig. 4a).76 The HEB monomer is dissolved in acetone to prevent rapid polymerisation. The acetone solution containing HEB is transferred to a Ag enclosure in a tubular furnace with the argon gas. Under thermal activation and Ag catalysis, the monomers are coupled through C–H bond cleavage (Fig. 4b). The inner surface of the Ag enclosure is smoother than the outer surface during the reaction due to less evaporation loss inside the Ag enclosure than on the outside. The smooth surface facilitates the diffusion of the precursor and the formation of an ordered 2D planar structure. The AFM image shows that the prepared graphdiyne has a monolayer thickness (Fig. 4c). However, the amorphous nature pointed out by the SAED pattern indicates that the structure of graphdiyne is still in-plane disordered (Fig. 4d), which may be caused by side reactions during the synthesis process. Therefore, the preparation of graphdiyne by CVD requires further design of the reaction environment to optimise the molecular structure. Li and his coworkers reported an explosion method to synthesise graphdiyne without metal catalysts.77 The reaction environment of HEB is explored by adjusting the atmosphere and temperature. The pale yellow HEB becomes dark black with no change in volume after being gradually heated to 120 °C in nitrogen. HEB undergoes a popcorn-like explosion with a sixfold increase in volume on changing the atmosphere and temperature to air and 90 °C, respectively. The oxygen may catalyse and accelerate the dehydrogenation of the coupling reaction. HEB explodes immediately and violently in preheated air at 120 °C temperature, increasing in volume by 48 times. The third condition inspires new ideas in the large-scale preparation of GDY.

3.2 Characterisation of graphdiyne
The characterisation of graphdiyne is essential for identifying graphdiyne and guiding the design of graphdiyne-based photocatalysts. Graphdiyne can be characterised by various approaches, including scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), AFM, TEM, Raman spectroscopy, infrared (IR) spectroscopy, ultraviolet–visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV–vis DRS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). Liu et al.83 used STM and AFM to observe the coupling reaction of organic monomers for graphdiyne synthesis. The STM image shows that the hexagonal ring of the incomplete graphdiyne nanostructure has a side length of about 9.1 ± 0.2 Å (Fig. 5a). The noncontact AFM image acquired through the CO tip confirms that the macromolecular ring of graphdiyne is composed of six aromatic rings coupled with alkyne bonds (Fig. 5b). The two high-resolution microscopy techniques allow the identification of the graphdiyne structure at the molecular or even atomic level. Lu and his coworkers explored the structure of graphdiyne by using TEM.84Fig. 5c shows the SAED image of graphdiyne nanosheets. The ABC-stacked mode of the graphdiyne nanosheet is determined by comparing the experimental and simulated SAED images (Fig. 5d). The simulated HRTEM images further reveal that the graphdiyne nanosheets have a 6-layer ABC stacking structure with a thickness of 2.19 nm (Fig. 5e–t). Zhang et al.85 predicted and confirmed that graphdiyne has six typical Raman peaks. As shown in Fig. 5u, peak B (956 cm−1) originates from the breathing vibrations of benzene and alkyne-related rings. Similar to graphene, peak G (1521 cm−1) of graphdiyne corresponds to the stretching mode of aromatic bonds. The peak G has a relatively small wavenumber and intensity and is probably caused by the acetylene bonds. Peak Y (2142 cm−1) results from the simultaneous stretching and contracting of acetylenic bonds. Three other Raman peaks are found in graphdiyne. Peak G′′ (1364 cm−1) is caused by the scissoring vibrations of atoms in the benzene ring. Peak G′ (1478 cm−1) derives from the vibrations of carbon–carbon bonds between the benzene ring and the adjacent alkyne bond. Peak Y′ (2221 cm−1) is the mode caused by the coexisting stretching vibrations (one-third alkyne bonds) and contracting vibrations (two-third alkyne bonds).

The surface chemical state of graphdiyne is explored by XPS. The deconvolved C 1s spectrum of graphdiyne has four peaks: C atoms of benzene rings and C atoms of CC, C–O, and CO bonds.86 The oxygen element is derived from atmospheric oxygen or the oxygen-containing groups in graphdiyne. IR spectroscopy gives information on the functional groups of graphdiyne. The peaks in the IR of graphdiyne at 1449 and 1603 cm−1 belong to the skeletal vibrations of the benzene ring. The peaks at 2122 and 2207 cm−1 should be assigned to the stretching vibrations of the CC bonds.87 UV-vis DRS can explore the light absorption of graphdiyne and related structural features. The UV–vis DRS shows that graphdiyne has three absorption peaks at 0.56, 0.89 and 1.79 eV. The first peak is caused by a bandgap transition, and the others are ascribed to the transition around Van Hove singularities.55 XAS can disclose the electronic structure of graphdiyne. In the XAS of graphdiyne, the peaks around 285.5 and 285.8 eV are attributed to π* excitations resulting from the benzene ring and CC bond, respectively.88
4. Application in solar fuel production
Photocatalytic solar fuel production is one of the important avenues for future energy transition (Fig. 6).89–91 Benefiting from the excellent physical and chemical properties of graphdiyne, graphdiyne-based photocatalysts are uniquely positioned for solar fuel production.92Table 2 summarises the achievements of graphdiyne-based photocatalysts in solar fuel production. The experimental parameters of related studies, including the photocatalyst composition, photocatalyst mass, light source, activity, and application in solar fuel production, are listed. This section helps understand the structure–activity relationship of graphdiyne-based photocatalysts in solar fuel production.

4.1 Advantages and disadvantages of graphdiyne
Due to the unique structural properties, graphdiyne has the following advantages in solar fuel production:
First, unlike other metal compounds, such as MoS2 and MXenes, graphdiyne is composed of carbon atoms. Metal-free graphdiyne is in line with green chemistry and sustainable development.80
Second, the porous structure of graphdiyne gives it a low atom density, resulting in a high specific surface area. Theoretically, graphdiyne is predicted to have a higher specific surface area than graphene,109 which endows graphdiyne with plentiful active sites and mass transfer channels for photocatalytic reactions. In addition, the high specific surface area of graphdiyne can inhibit the aggregation of nanoparticles on the graphdiyne surface.
Third, graphdiyne has a natural direct bandgap, making it a potential photocatalyst. The semiconductivity of graphdiyne is an advantage over graphene with zero bandgaps. In addition, the acetylenic bonds make the charge distribution on the plane of graphdiyne uneven, endowing the graphdiyne with chemical activity. However, graphene is inert because its electronic properties are isotropic in the plane.110
Fourth, theoretically, metal atoms interact more strongly with sp-hybridised carbon atoms in graphdiyne than with sp2-hybridized carbon atoms in conventional carbon materials.111 Graphdiyne can anchor metal atoms through chemisorption rather than physical adsorption between graphene and metal atoms.112,113 It is noteworthy that the photocatalytic activity of sp-hybridised carbon atoms in graphdiyne is higher than that of sp2-hybridized carbon atoms.114 Moreover, graphdiyne can stabilise metal nanoparticles.115 Therefore, graphdiyne is a good support for metals or metal compounds.
Fifth, graphdiyne has excellent chemical stability under harsh conditions, such as with strong acids/bases.116 This is beneficial for the continuous photocatalytic reaction.
Sixth, the electrons in graphdiyne behave as a massless Dirac fermion.52,53 Thus, graphdiyne has excellent electrical conductivity and high carrier mobility, promoting the efficient transport of photogenerated carriers.
Seventh, the thermal conductivity of graphdiyne is significantly lower than that of graphene.117 Therefore, graphdiyne as a local hotspot in photocatalysts can facilitate photocatalytic reactions through a photothermal effect.103
Although graphdiyne exhibits excellent properties in many aspects, a rational attitude towards graphdiyne should be held. Graphdiyne is not perfect.
First, graphdiyne is less stable than graphene in terms of energy.117 This is related to the acetylenic bonds in graphdiyne.51
Second, the carrier mobility of graphdiyne, both along the zigzag and armchair directions, is lower than that of graphene.117
Third, the synthesis of graphdiyne is difficult to control due to the poor stability of monomers, leading to side reactions and a high proportion of amorphous graphdiyne.
Therefore, although the unique advantages of graphdiyne are commended, its limitations in photocatalysis should be recognised. A rational attitude towards graphdiyne is essential to further exploit its properties and achieve efficient photocatalytic solar fuel production.
4.2 H2 generation
Hydrogen is green energy with high energy density, low carbon, and wide applications, and is gradually becoming one of the important carriers for the development of global energy transformation.118–121 The utilisation of hydrogen energy can promote the green and low-carbon transformation of energy-consuming terminals, such as high-energy-consuming and high-emission transportation and industry.122–124 Therefore, hydrogen production is of great importance for building a clean, low-carbon and efficient energy system and achieving the goal of carbon neutrality. Compared with hydrogen production from fossil fuels, industrial byproducts and methanol reforming, photocatalytic hydrogen production technology is safe, convenient and pollution-free.125,126
The essence of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution is the reduction of H+ to H2 by photogenerated electrons. However, the severe recombination of photogenerated carriers within a single photocatalyst makes it difficult for photogenerated electrons to arrive at the photocatalyst surface to participate in the reduction reaction. Therefore, assisted outward extraction of photogenerated electrons from the photocatalyst is necessary. The electron-deficient acetylenic bonds in graphdiyne make graphdiyne a suitable electron acceptor.127 When combined with a photocatalyst, graphdiyne can extract electrons from the photocatalyst, facilitating the separation and transfer of photogenerated carriers. Moreover, the porous structure of graphdiyne can promote the diffusion of H+ and the release of hydrogen gas.128 Furthermore, graphdiyne has a low hydrogen evolution overpotential, favouring the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction.129 These advantages contribute to the excellent activities of graphdiyne-based photocatalysts in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution.130–132
For instance, Li et al. synthesised a graphdiyne/CuBr composite using CuBr as a substrate for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution.133 Due to the suitable band arrangement between graphdiyne and CuBr, a p–n heterojunction is formed between them. As an electron acceptor, the graphdiyne effectively promotes the separation and transfer of carriers and the adsorption and mass transfer of reactants. Therefore, the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance of graphdiyne/CuBr is significantly enhanced compared to those of pure CuBr and GDY. This work suggests that graphdiyne as an electron acceptor helps in inhibiting charge carrier recombination in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution.
Yan et al. designed and constructed a NiTiO3/CuI/graphdiyne S-scheme heterojunction for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution.93 In this ternary system, under light illumination, the photogenerated electrons in the conduction band of CuI and the photogenerated holes in the valence band of graphdiyne recombine with the photogenerated holes in the valence band and the photogenerated electrons in the conduction band of NiTiO3, respectively. As a result, the useful photogenerated electrons and holes are retained in the conduction band of graphdiyne and the valence band of CuI, respectively, thus significantly improving the redox ability of the system. In addition, the π-conjugated carbon network of graphdiyne can effectively prevent the aggregation of CuI nanoparticles and promote the migration of charge carriers. Therefore, graphdiyne can effectively assist inthe photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction.
A graphdiyne/g-C3N4 (GD/g-C3N4) heterojunction was fabricated by Xu et al. for photocatalytic H2 production.95 g-C3N4 has many mesopores caused by gas release during the preparation of g-C3N4 (Fig. 7a).134,135 This porous structure provides many active sites and promotes mass transfer. Given that the constituent elements of GD and g-C3N4 contain carbon, finding their difference from the contrast of the TEM image is difficult (Fig. 7b). The mesopores of g-C3N4 contributed to distinguishing them because GD does not possess pores of tens of nanometers like those in g-C3N4. The GD/g-C3N4 heterojunction containing 0.5 wt% GD shows the optimal photocatalytic hydrogen production activity, approximately seven and six times greater than those of g-C3N4 and the physical mixture of GD and g-C3N4, respectively (Fig. 7c). The tight binding between GD and g-C3N4 can originate from the newly formed C–N bonds. These C–N bonds promote the tight bonding between GD and g-C3N4, and provide a channel for carrier transfer, significantly suppressing carrier recombination. The photocatalytic mechanism is indicated in Fig. 7d, where Pt is mainly photodeposited on the GD surface because GD enables electron enrichment. Under light conditions, the electrons transfer from g-C3N4 to Pt via the newly formed C–N bonds or π–π conjugation between GD and g-C3N4 and participate in H2 generation.

Besides, graphdiyne has a bandgap, making it a potential photocatalyst for hydrogen production. Shen et al. synthesised a 3D graphdiyne network composed of helical dehydrobenzoannulene-based nanofibers.136 The introduction of dehydrobenzoannulene is a chemical regulation of the acetylenic bonds in the graphdiyne. The theoretically calculated free energy for the hydrogen evolution reaction indicates that the curved butadiyne units in the dehydrobenzoannulene are the active sites for hydrogen evolution. The 3D graphdiyne network with a high specific surface area facilitates the separation of photogenerated carriers and the diffusion of hydrogen ions. Therefore, the chemical tailorability of the acetylenic bond provides an opportunity for the application of graphdiyne-based photocatalysts in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution.
4.3 CO2 reduction
The gases that absorb IR radiation lead to the greenhouse effect.137,138 The core requirement for mitigating the greenhouse effect is reducing CO2 emissions.139 CO2 emission reduction is less complicated under the existing technical conditions compared to that of other greenhouse gases. Therefore, the recently proposed carbon peaking and carbon neutrality are global trends. Emerging carbon capture, utilisation and storage technologies to achieve net-zero CO2 emissions have received increasing attention.140–143
Photocatalytic CO2 reduction contributes to net-zero CO2 emissions by converting CO2 into solar fuel to power society.144–148 Efforts have been devoted to solar fuel production using graphdiyne-based photocatalysts. The role of graphdiyne as an electron acceptor to suppress the recombination of photogenerated carriers is also effective in photocatalytic CO2 reduction. Furthermore, the electron-enriched graphdiyne facilitates the multielectron reaction for CO2 reduction. It is worth noting that photocatalytic CO2 reduction is mainly a gas–solid reaction, which is different from photocatalytic hydrogen production. The irregular thermal motion of gaseous CO2 molecules makes it difficult for the photocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction to progress. Even in some liquid–solid reactions for photocatalytic CO2 reduction, the content of CO2 in solution is low. Therefore, the efficient adsorption of CO2 on the photocatalyst as the initial stage of the CO2 photoreduction reaction is crucial. Given that CO2 molecules contain delocalised π bonds, the π–π conjugation action between graphdiyne and CO2 molecules is beneficial for CO2 adsorption.38 Furthermore, this strong π–π conjugation effect can activate CO2 molecules and facilitate the CO2 reduction reaction.24 In addition, the porous structure of graphdiyne can accelerate the mass transfer of CO2 molecules in the pores and improve CO2 adsorption.
The products of photocatalytic CO2 reduction are diverse, including CO, CH4, CH3OH, and even multicarbon products. Therefore, the selective conversion of CO2 is a hotspot and challenge for photocatalytic CO2 reduction. Graphdiyne can promote the selective conversion of CO2 to CO. For instance, Wang et al. synthesised graphdiyne/carbon nitride van der Waals heterojunctions by electrostatic self-assembly for photocatalytic CO2 reduction.102 Graphdiyne as an electron acceptor suppresses the recombination of photogenerated carriers and provides abundant CO2 adsorption sites. Furthermore, theoretical calculations suggest that CO2 activation tends to occur on the graphdiyne surface. More importantly, the adsorption energy of CO molecules on graphdiyne (0.89 eV) is higher than that on carbon nitride (0.36 eV), indicating that CO molecules more easily desorbed from the graphdiyne surface. Under illumination, photogenerated electrons accumulate on graphdiyne and reduce CO2 adsorbed on the graphdiyne to CO. The CO is easily desorbed from the graphdiyne surface, resulting in high selectivity.
Cao et al.104 demonstrated that graphdiyne is more favourable in enhancing CO2 photoreduction than graphene by using CdS nanocrystals as a model. This finding is due to the stronger bonding between CdS and graphdiyne than that between CdS and graphene. The sulphur vacancies and electron-deficient CC triple bonds provide many CO2 adsorption sites. The solid interfacial coupling between CdS and graphdiyne, and improved CO2 adsorption contribute to the photocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction, achieving excellent activity, stability and CO selectivity.
Xu et al. prepared TiO2/graphdiyne (TiO2/GDY) composites for photocatalytic CO2 reduction.103 The surfaces of GDY nanosheets and TiO2 nanofibers are negatively and positively charged when the pH is 4, respectively (Fig. 8a). The TiO2/GDY composites are successively prepared by simple electrostatic self-assembly and calcination methods. The TEM images indicate the tight bonding between GDY and TiO2, and the TiO2 is composed of two crystal phases, anatase and rutile (Fig. 8b–d). The photocatalytic CO2 reduction performance test shows that the products of the photocatalytic system are mainly CO, CH4 and O2, and have high CO selectivity (Fig. 8e). Compared with pure TiO2 nanofibres, the performance of TiO2/GDY composites is significantly improved owing to the GDY cocatalyst. Specifically, the enhanced photocatalytic CO2 reduction performance arises from the following aspects: (1) GDY helps adsorb and activate CO2 molecules; (2) the internal electric field formed at the TiO2/GDY interface suppresses carrier recombination; and (3) GDY provides an electron storage platform for multielectron reduction of CO2 (Fig. 8f). This work points out the prospects of GDY cocatalysts in photocatalytic solar fuel production.

The negatively charged surface of graphdiyne facilitates the preparation of composites by electrostatic self-assembly and adsorbs metal ions to promote the growth of semiconductors on the graphdiyne surface. As shown in Fig. 9a, Bi3+ ions are adsorbed on the GDY surface to grow Bi2WO6 nanosheets through a hydrothermal method. The prepared GDY/Bi2WO6 heterojunction has an ultrathin 2D/2D structure with a thickness within 10 nm (Fig. 9b–d). The TEM image confirms that the GDY/Bi2WO6 heterojunction has a distinct 2D stacking structure (Fig. 9e). The total CO2 conversion of the optimal composite is 4.9 times greater than that of pure Bi2WO6 nanosheets under simulated sunlight irradiation, and their products are mainly methane and methanol (Fig. 9f). BiGDY-3 maintains good stability after five cycles of performance tests (Fig. 9g). The GDY enhances light absorption (Fig. 9h), promotes CO2 adsorption (Fig. 9i), and improves the separation of photogenerated carriers (Fig. 9j). Therefore, GDY is promising in photocatalytic CO2 reduction.

4.4 N2 fixation
Nitrogen fertilisers are indispensable for the growth of crops that support human survival and development. The current industrial production of nitrogen fertilisers relies on ammonia synthesis using H2 and N2 at high temperature and pressure, also known as the Haber–Bosch process.149 However, this method is energy-intensive and releases large amounts of harmful byproducts. The photocatalytic nitrogen fixation development helps reduce reliance on the Haber–Bosch process and is a promising production technology for nitrogen fertilisers and nitrogen compounds.
Since N2 molecules with a dissociation energy of 941 kJ mol−1 are highly stable, activating N2 molecules is challenging in photocatalytic nitrogen fixation.150 The abundant acetylenic bonds in graphdiyne not only promote the adsorption of N2 through π–π conjugation with N2 molecules but also facilitate the activation of N2 molecules. Besides, the porous structure of graphdiyne with acetylenic bonds can anchor metal ions, which is beneficial for loading metal-based compounds on graphdiyne. The chemical bonds formed between N2 molecules and metal atoms can weaken the NN bonds and lower the energy barrier of the nitrogen fixation reaction. Therefore, research on nitrogen fixation over graphdiyne-based photocatalysts attracts widespread interest.
Fang et al.107 found that graphdiyne can tune the coordination environment of iron elements in Fe3O4, resulting in excellent photocatalytic N2-to-NH3 conversion activity. Extended X-ray absorption fine structure analysis indicated that graphdiyne could modulate the molecular configuration of Fe3O4 and the number of defects in graphdiyne/Fe3O4. The regulation of the coordination environment of Fe3O4 by graphdiyne could increase the number of photogenerated carriers and inhibit their recombination, thereby contributing to the photocatalytic nitrogen fixation reaction.
Considering that graphdiyne has abundant CC bonds to anchor metal ions, Liu et al. prepared a novel photocatalyst constructed with graphdiyne (GDY) loaded with CoOx quantum dots (QDs) for NH3 production.108 As shown in Fig. 10a–c, CoOx QDs are uniformly dispersed on the GDY nanosheets with a thickness of ∼4 nm. The GDY@CoOx composite maintains good stability in 46 consecutive photocatalytic ammonia synthesis tests, in which the highest, lowest and average ammonia production rates are 26502, 15026 and 19583 μmol g−1 h−1 (Fig. 10d). A dominant surface plasmon resonance effect of a GDY@CoOx composite can be observed at 500 nm in UV–vis DRS, resulting in an apparent quantum efficiency of 8.72% (Fig. 10e). The excellent photocatalytic nitrogen fixation performance is closely related to the valence state conversion of the Co element. XPS analysis shows the presence of two types of Co ions (Co2+ and Co3+) in the CoOx QDs. The ratio of Co3+/Co2+ in the GDY@CoOx composite increases along with the photocatalytic N2 fixation reaction due to the CoOx storing photogenerated holes. As shown in Fig. 10f, the photogenerated electrons move from CoOx to GDY under light illumination. The GDY provides many active sites and an electron-rich environment for nitrogen reduction. Therefore, the GDY@CoOx complex significantly enhances the photocatalytic N2 fixation activity.

5. Conclusions
Developing low-carbon and clean energy is a resource-sustainable, environment friendly, and ecological civilisation path. Photocatalytic solar fuel production provides a feasible idea for global low-carbon development and is a mainstream hot topic in the world's energy and economic fields. Graphdiyne has rapidly emerged as a rising star in photocatalysis since its first synthesis. This article outlines the structure, properties, preparation and characterisation of graphdiyne and its applications in photocatalytic solar fuel production, including H2 evolution, CO2 reduction and N2 fixation. Although graphdiyne-based photocatalysts have made many achievements in photocatalytic solar fuel production, their activities are still far from practical application. The research on graphdiyne is at an initial stage. We hope that graphdiyne-based photocatalysts will make progress and breakthroughs in the following aspects in the future:
(1) Note that graphdiyne is hydrophobic,151 which is unfavourable for adsorbing H2O molecules. The photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction can be hindered. Therefore, the appropriate functionalisation of graphdiyne may optimise its photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance.
(2) The application of graphdiyne-based photocatalysts in hydrogen peroxide production is rarely reported and should be further explored.
(3) At present, graphdiyne is usually synthesised on substrates. The direct preparation of freestanding graphdiyne has rarely been reported. Therefore, freestanding graphdiyne should be paid attention to and applied to modulation of the structure and properties of graphdiyne-based photocatalysts.
(4) Magic-angle graphene has attracted much attention recently.152 The effect of this interlayer twist on graphdiyne and graphdiyne-based photocatalysts is worth exploring.
(5) The two planes of graphdiyne can be modified by different groups to separate photogenerated carriers in space.
(6) Many physical and chemical properties of graphdiyne are obtained by theoretical simulations. More advanced characterisation methods and experimental data are needed to discover and verify them.
(7) The synthesis of graphdiyne is expensive. The commonly used monomer is HEB; however, its high price limits the large-scale production of graphdiyne. Optimising the synthesis cost of HEB or finding other inexpensive monomers is imperative.
Besides, the challenges for graphdiyne-based photocatalysts in solar fuel production are summarised as follows:
(i) A vital issue in photocatalytic CO2 reduction is the origin of the products. Tracing the carbonaceous products by isotopically labelled 13CO2 is a common method in photocatalytic CO2 reduction. However, few studies have focused on the source of hydrogen in hydrocarbon products, such as CH4. The incomplete coupling reaction during the synthesis of graphdiyne can result in some hydrogen elements in the graphdiyne. Thus, the source of hydrogen in the hydrocarbon products should also be identified. Correspondingly, the stability of graphdiyne during photocatalytic CO2 reduction should be examined. These considerations apply equally to photocatalytic nitrogen fixation.
(ii) The controllable preparation of graphdiyne is a remarkable challenge. The synthesis of high-quality graphdiyne still faces technical difficulties.
(iii) The structural characterisation of graphdiyne still requires much effort, especially at the atomic level.
(iv) The roles of aromatic rings and acetylenic bonds in the reaction need to be revealed to clarify the active sites of graphdiyne-based photocatalysts in solar fuel production.
(v) Efforts should not be limited to graphdiyne. Other materials in the graphyne family, such as graphyne and graphtriyne, and their applications in solar fuel production should be further explored.
Graphdiyne-based photocatalysts for solar fuel production deserve continuous attention and in-depth study. This paper is expected to promote the low-carbon development of solar fuel.
