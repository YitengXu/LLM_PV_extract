, Accepted 2nd November 2018First published on 6th November 2018AbstractA facile large-area synthesis of a WS2/MoTe2 heterostructure via a sputtering–CVD approach on conductive glass substrates was demonstrated and, for the first time, it was used as a counter electrode (CE) for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and Tafel curves verified that the unique structure is beneficial for improving the catalytic activity for the reduction of triiodide to iodide and a low charge transfer resistance at the electrode/electrolyte interface. The thicknesses of the top and bottom layers of WS2/MoTe2 were varied to achieve high DSSC performance. Consequently, DSSCs assembled with the optimized WS2/MoTe2 CE reached a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.99%, which is comparable to the conventional Pt CE (8.50%) and their pristine WS2 and MoTe2 CEs (6.3% and 7.25%, respectively). Our findings create a way to prepare DSSCs with efficient performance.
1. Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are promising candidates for replacing traditional silicon solar cells that dominate up to 80% of the market.1–3 Owing to their low cost, relatively high energy conversion efficiency and easy fabrication, DSSCs have emerged as promising candidates for the production of solar energy to overcome the global energy crisis. In general, a DSSC has a sandwich structure with a porous nanocrystalline TiO2 film electrode sensitized with a dye, a redox electrolyte containing iodide/triiodide (I−/I3−), and a counter electrode (CE) catalyzing the reduction of I3− to I−. Platinum (Pt) is most widely used as the CE in DSSCs, but it has a low abundance ratio and high costs, and it can be easily decomposed in the liquid state (I−/I3−) redox electrolyte to form PtI4 and H2PtI6 which would affect the long-term stability.4,5 Due to these consequences, stable and valuable replacements for Pt CEs are necessary for the large-scale manufacture of DSSCs. Some studies report the use of Pt-containing composites, such as platinum-nickel/cobalt oxide (Pt-NiO/Co3O4) nanocompounds and platinum-nickel oxide (Pt-NiO) nanosheets for enhancing the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs).6,7 Numerous attempts have also been made with Pt-free CEs, which include transparent and flexible carbon materials,8–10 conducting polymers,11,12 transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs),13–18 nitrides,19,20 and carbides21,22 to reduce the cost effect. Among them, TMDCs are attractive due to their sizable bandgaps and natural abundance.
DSSCs employing TMDC-CEs on fluorine-doped tin oxide glass (FTO) exhibited PCEs of 6.0–6.3%.23–26 Transition metal tellurides such as tungsten telluride (WTe2) and molybdenum telluride (MoTe2) from the family of TMDC materials are promising potential CEs due to their inherent features such as stability in both 2H and 1T′ phases, lower energy band gap (∼1 eV) compared with other TMDCs and a low thermal conductivity of ∼2 W m−1 K−1.27,28 Recently, few-layer 2H-MoTe2 flakes were prepared by mechanical exfoliation and the measured field-effect mobility was comparable to those of 2H-MoS2 and 2H-MoSe2.29 We previously reported DSSCs with WS2 and MoTe2-CEs (PCEs of 6.3% and 7.25%, respectively24,30).
In this work, we developed a WS2/MoTe2 heterostructure by a sputtering–CVD method. For the heterostructure preparation, the MoTe2 film was sputtered on FTO glass and then the film was subjected to tellurization. WS2 was prepared by sputtering–sulfurization on MoTe2/FTO. The thicknesses of the top and bottom layers were tuned to enhance the performance of DSSCs. The optimized WS2/MoTe2 CE revealed a high PCE of 7.99% under a simulated solar illumination of 100 mW cm−2 (AM 1.5), which is comparable to conventional Pt CE (8.50%) and pristine WS2 and MoTe2 CE structures (6.3% and 7.25%, respectively).
2. Experimental details
2.1 Preparation of heterostructure
WS2/MoTe2 was synthesized by the sequential growth of a MoTe2 and WS2 sputtering–CVD combined route as indicated in the results and discussion section. For the tellurization and sulfurization, tellurium powder (0.3 g) and sulfur powder (0.4 g) (99.99% pure, Sigma Aldrich) were used. In a CVD furnace, the Ar gas flow rate (100 sccm) and pressure (∼3 × 10−3 torr) were constantly maintained for all the experiments.
2.2 Characterization of DSSCs
DSSCs were fabricated to evaluate the CE performance of WS2/MoTe2 heterostructures as described in our previous study.31–34 Briefly, a nanocrystalline thin blocking layer of TiO2 was deposited on a cleaned FTO glass substrate (15 × 15 mm2) by immersion in 40 mM TiCl4 isopropanol solution for 30 min at 70 °C and then annealed at 450 °C for 30 min. A homemade titanium dioxide (TiO2) powder paste of P25 was coated on the cleaned FTO glass as the main layer (∼12 μm thickness) using a simple doctor blade coating technique. The TiO2-coated FTO was then sintered in five steps of 70, 325, 375, 450, and 500 °C for 30, 5, 5, 15, and 15 min, respectively, in a high temperature furnace (Lab House Co.). After sintering, the substrate was cooled to room temperature. Additionally, a scattering layer (∼6 μm) was coated over the main layer and sintered using the same sintering steps. The TiO2 film was then sensitized with 0.5 mM N 719 prepared in an absolute ethanol:acetonitrile (1:1) solution at room temperature for 24 h. The polymer electrolyte, which was composed of 0.5 M LiI, 0.6 M 1-propyl-2,3-dimethylimidazolium iodide, 0.05 M I2, 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine, and 3% w/w polyethylene oxide (Mw 250000) with acetonitrile as the solvent was then injected between the two electrodes. The Pt-coated CE was prepared by spreading a drop of 2 mM chloroplatinic acid hexahydrate (H2PtCl6) dissolved in isopropanol onto the FTO substrate using a simple brush method and annealed at 400 °C for 15 min in ambient air.35,36 The active area of the dye-sensitized TiO2 photoanode was 0.25 cm2 and the as-fabricated CE was assembled using 50 μm-thick spacer polyimide adhesive tape.
3. Results and discussion
 Fig. 1 shows the schematic for the WS2/MoTe2 synthesis. Initially, the MoTe2 film was deposited onto a FTO substrate by sputtering (MoTe2 target, 99.4% purity), and then the film was annealed at 500–550 °C in a tellurium environment in a CVD chamber to improve the crystalline quality. Then a thin layer of WS2 was deposited on the MoTe2 film/FTO by sputtering WS2 (WS2 target 99.4% purity) and then subjected to annealing at 500–550 °C under a sulfur environment. The film thickness was varied by tuning the sputtering time. The top layer of WS2 plays a crucial role in the performance of the DSSC due to its direct contact with the electrolyte, hence, the thickness of the MoTe2 film was fixed at ∼340 nm and three different thicknesses of the WS2 film, ∼119 nm, ∼203 nm, and ∼273 nm were prepared and they are further referred to as S1 (WS2-119 nm/MoTe2-340 nm), S2 (WS2-203 nm/MoTe2-340 nm), and S3 (WS2-273 nm/MoTe2-340 nm). In order to see the scalability, a 10 × 1 cm2 size of S3 was prepared and its FESEM images were captured at three different places as shown in Fig. S1(a) and (b–d),† respectively. No significant differences are observed in the surface morphology. Fig. 2a–c show the FESEM surface morphology of S1, S2 and S3, respectively. Agglomerated grains are observed on the top surface. The cross-sectional FESEM images (Fig. 2d–f) show the presence of the dual layer nature of WS2/MoTe2.

Raman spectroscopy was employed to confirm the formation of MoTe2, WS2 and WS2/MoTe2 (S1, S2 and S3) (Fig. 3a). For the MoTe2 film, the peaks originating at 161.2 and 267.6 cm−1 correspond to the Ag mode, while the shoulder peak at 188.9 cm−1 can be ascribed to the Bg mode which are typically associated with the 1T′ phase of MoTe2.37 For the WS2 film, the in-plane E2g mode and out-of-plane A1g mode vibrations are observed at 353.2 cm−1 and 418.5 cm−1, respectively. In the case of WS2/MoTe2, all the samples show the couple of E2g and A1g mode signals (@ ∼351.4 and ∼417.3 cm−1, respectively) from WS2, whereas a sharp peak is observed at ∼161.9 cm−1 from MoTe2. The slight variations are exhibited in the Raman signal frequencies and intensities of the S1, S2 and S3 samples which might be due to the S/Te ratio as reported earlier.38,39 Raman analysis was carried out at five different positions on the large S3 sample (10 × 1 cm2). The observed peak intensities and positions confirmed the growth of WS2/MoTe2 (Fig. S4†). Raman mapping analysis was also performed over an area of 50 μm × 50 μm to confirm the uniform growth as shown in Fig. S5.†

To investigate the structural properties of MoTe2 and WS2 and WS2/MoTe2 (S1, S2 and S3), X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed (Fig. 3b). The diffraction patterns of MoTe2 and WS2 are well matched with the standard patterns (JCPDS No.: MoTe2-71-2157 and WS2-872417). In the case of WS2/MoTe2 (S1, S2 and S3), the MoTe2 related peaks are dominant due to its higher thickness. In addition, the (002) lattice peak is predominantly oriented for all the samples.
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) depth profile analysis was carried out to confirm the heterostructure formation. XPS survey spectra of the WS2/MoTe2 heterostructure are provided in Fig. S6a and b† for before and after the etching. Fig. 4 shows the XPS depth profile spectra of the WS2/MoTe2 heterostructure. The variations of atomic concentrations in terms of the etching time are given in Fig. 4a. For the 0 etching time, the W and S elements are dominant due to the top layer position of WS2. The top layer elements are gradually decreased, and the bottom layer elements are increased with increasing the etching time. At an etching time of 125 s, the W and S elements eventually disappeared due to the complete etching of top layer WS2. The W 4f binding energy spectra (Fig. 4b) reveal the W 4p3/2, 4f5/2, and 4f7/2 states at 37.87 eV, 33.85 eV and 31.67 eV, respectively, whereas the S 2p binding energy spectra (Fig. 4c) confirm the S 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 signals at 161.4 and 162.4 eV, respectively, with the slight variations of their positions with etching time.16,40 From the W 4f and S 2p binding energy spectra (Fig. 4b and c), the well-established peaks are observed at the 0–100 s etching time and then (>100 s) it showed no signal at that binding energy region which confirmed no severe diffusion of WS2 into the bottom layer of MoTe2. For MoTe2 (Fig. 4d and e), the Mo 3d peaks at 229.6 and 231.51 eV correspond to the doublet of 3d5/2 and 3d3/2, respectively, and the Te 3d signals at 573.6 and 583.3 eV are ascribed to the doublet of Te 3d5/2 and Te 3d3/2, respectively.41

 Fig. 5a illustrates the schematic representation of DSSCs assembled with WS2/MoTe2 CE. The photocurrent density versus photovoltage (J–V) curves of DSSCs with a standard Pt CE and S1, S2 and S3 are shown in Fig. 5b. The parameters of DSSCs such as short circuit current (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF) and PCEs are summarized in Table 1. The S3 CE (7.99%) exhibits the best performance compared with those of S1 and S2. As expected, the noble metal Pt showed a better PCE of 8.50%. The PCE values decrease in the order of Pt > S3 > S2 > S1. The observed PCEs are higher compared with those of its pristine MoTe2 (7.25%) and WS2 (6.3%) CEs as shown in Fig. S7 and Table S1.† MoTe2 could allow the rapid charge exchange with its abundant active sites for electrochemical reactions,27,37,42 and the bottom layer could increase the (I−/I3−) redox reaction rate on the CE side, thus possibly enhance the Jsc value.43 The good conductivity and good electrocatalytic activity of MoTe2 and WS2 and their synergistic effects are supported by the low Rct at the interface between the electrolyte and the CE for the (I−/I3−) redox reaction, which is beneficial to the FF value.43

In order to see the effects of the thickness of each layer, three additional samples were prepared. One is the sample with a thicker MoTe2 layer compared with S3 (WS2/MoTe2 = ∼273/∼888 nm, S4), the second one has a thicker WS2 layer compared with S3 (WS2/MoTe2: ∼354/∼340 nm, S5), and the third one has a thinner MoTe2 layer compared with S3 (WS2/MoTe2: ∼273/∼286 nm, S6). The cross-sectional FESEM images and their J–V profiles are provided in Fig. S8–10.† The detailed performance parameters are shown in Table S2, S3, and S4. The PCEs are 6.0%, 7.53%, and 7.4% for S4, S5, and S6, respectively. We believe that the increase in the thickness of the bottom MoTe2 layer increased the film resistance which reduced the FF by hindering the electron transfer from the top layer.44 These results indicate that the properties of DSSC are dependent on the thicknesses of the top and bottom layers of WS2/MoTe2. The observed PCE value of the S3 CE (7.99%) is better than those of TMDCs, including WS2 films (4.56%),45 MoS2 with artificial active edge sites (5.8%),26 porous chalcogens of CoMoS4 and NiMoS4 (7.14–7.31%),46 highly transparent NiCo2S4 thin films (6.14%),47 multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs)@MoS2 (6.45%),48 MWCNTs@WS2 (6.41%),49 MoS2/graphene flakes (5.98%),50 and MoS2/RGO (6.04%).51
To understand the I−/I3− redox behaviour of Pt and optimized S3 CEs, the cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were carried out in a three-electrode system using Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode, Pt wire as the CE and the Pt or S3 sample as the working electrode in an acetonitrile electrolyte solution consisting of 10 mM LiI, 1 mM I2, and 0.1 mM LiClO4 at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 (Fig. 6a). From the CV curves, two redox couples which correspond to the reduction of I3− (cathodic peak) and the oxidation of I− (anodic peak) are observed. The value of the peak to peak separation between the anodic and the cathodic peak (ΔEpp) is inversely proportional to the electrochemical rate constant for a redox reaction, ks (ΔEppα1/ks). Epp is calculated using the formula: 
ΔEpp = Ea − Ec.

(d) Nyquist plots of the symmetrical cells. Inset – the equivalent circuit of the symmetrical cell (Rct: charge transfer resistance, Zw: diffusion impedance, Rs: ohmic internal resistance, and CPE: constant phase element). 
The shape of the S3 CV curve is similar to that of Pt (peak positions and current densities), suggesting comparable catalytic activity for the reduction of I3−. The ΔEpp of the S3 is slightly higher than that of Pt, which implies a slightly higher rate of redox reactions than that of the Pt. This may be due to the sharing of plenty of active edge sites in the S3 which enhances the catalytic properties of the CE. The long-term stability assessed by 120 successive cycles of CV performance for the redox behaviour is shown in Fig. S11.† The shape of the CV curve remains constant for all the cycles which suggests that the S3 CE possesses good electrochemical stability. The CVs of sample S3 were measured at different scan rates from 10 to 100 mV s−1 as shown in Fig. 6b. There is a linear increment of the current peak value with an increase of the scan rate, indicating that the internal sites of the S3 CE are more reactive and helpful for enhancing the catalytic activity at a higher scan rate.50,52
Tafel polarization measurements were conducted with a symmetrical dummy cell (Fig. 6c). The slopes in the anodic or cathodic branch of Pt are slightly higher than those of S3 which indicates a higher exchange current density (J0) on the electrode. Since the J0 is inversely proportional to the charge-transfer resistance (Rct) as seen from eqn (2), the low Rct at the electrolyte–electrode interface reduces the loss during charge transportation and enhances the charge collection efficiency, increasing the Jsc and FF of DSSCs. 
J0 = (RT/nFRct)
(2)where R is the gas constant, T is the absolute temperature, n is the number of electrons involved in the reaction, and F is Faraday's constant.53,54
EIS measurements were employed to investigate the electrocatalytic activity of S3 and Pt using symmetrical dummy cells which were fabricated with two identical CEs similar to the Tafel measurements to re-confirm the interfacial charge-transfer properties of the (I−/I3−) redox couple on the CE surface (Fig. 6d). The relevant equivalent Randles-type circuit model is shown in the inset of Fig. 6d, in which two semicircles are observed in the lower (left) and higher (right) frequency regions. The low-frequency intercept on the real axis corresponds to the series resistance (Rs), while the diameter of the high-frequency semicircle corresponds to the Rct at the CE–electrolyte interface, and constant phase element (CPE) at the CE/electrolyte interface. The Rct of the conventional Pt CE is much lower than that of the S3 CE, which indicates the higher activity of Pt for I3− reduction. The Rct values of the Pt and S3 CEs are 0.97 and 3.98 Ω cm2, respectively. The obtained Rs values are 8.58 Ω cm2 and 14.64 Ω cm2, for the Pt and S3 CEs, respectively. Due to the semiconducting behaviour, the S3 CE exhibits a higher Rs value than Pt CE.55,56
4. Conclusions
A WS2/MoTe2 heterostructure was successfully synthesized via a sputtering–CVD approach on a conductive glass substrate and proposed for the first time as the CE for DSSCs. The top and bottom layer thicknesses were tuned for maximizing the PCEs. The optimized WS2/MoTe2 CE (S3) revealed a high PCE of 7.99% under a simulated solar illumination of 100 mW cm−2 (AM 1.5), which was comparable to the 8.50% observed for a DSSC with a Pt CE. Furthermore, the CV, Tafel curve analysis, and EIS results demonstrated that the WS2/MoTe2 CE exhibited good electrocatalytic properties and a low charge transfer resistance at the electrolyte–electrode interface.
