    , Accepted 11th March 2014First published on 13th March 2014AbstractA novel and facile strategy was applied to synthesize Au nanoparticles (Au NPs)-functionalized ZnO microsheet (MS) hybrid-materials. First, the layered 2D porous ZnO MSs were fabricated by a simple hydrothermal method followed by a calcination process, only using zinc acetate dihydrate and urea as the sources. Then the as-prepared ZnO MSs were further functionalized by small Au NPs, assembled by using green, non-toxic lysine as a capping agent. The obtained samples were characterized by means of XRD, TGA, SEM, TEM and EDS. In order to prove the enhanced combining properties of the hybrid materials, gas sensors were fabricated based on them. And the obtained results showed that, after functionalization with Au NPs, the porous ZnO MS hybrid sensor exhibited enhanced sensing performances towards several volatile organic compounds (VOCs) including n-butanol, ethanol, methanol, acetone and benzene, indicating its potential application as a gas sensor in detecting VOCs. The enhanced sensing properties are related to the unique structure of porous ZnO MSs and the strong spillover effect of small Au NPs for catalyzing sensing reactions, as well as the increased Schottky barriers caused by the electronic interaction between Au NPs and the ZnO support.
1. Introduction
As a typical n-type metal oxide semiconductor (MOS), ZnO, with a wide band-gap (3.37 eV) and a large exciton binding energy (60 meV) at room temperature, possesses unique acoustic, catalytic, optical and electronic properties,1–5 and thus has great potential applications in room-temperature UV lasers,6 optoelectronics,5 light-emitting diodes (LEDs),7 field-effect transistors,8 photodetectors,9 piezoelectrics,10 sensors,11 and solar cells.12 To date, various morphologies of ZnO nanostructures have been synthesized including zero-dimension (e.g. nanoparticles,13 quantum dots14), one-dimension (e.g. nanowires,15 nanorods,16 nanotubes,17 nanoneedles18) and three-dimension (e.g. nanotrees,19 nanocones,20 nanoflowers,21 hollow spheres22). In contrast to other ZnO nanostructures, two-dimensional (2D) ZnO nanostructures (e.g., nanosheets or nanowalls) with a layered structure and without being wrapped around each other into a complex 3D hierarchically structure (flowers, spheres etc.) have remained conspicuously absent.23–27 It is evident that, compared with complex 3D hierarchical structure constructed by numerous 2D nanosheet (NS) units, the layered 2D NS structure can provide higher accessible surface area and active sites, thus improving the reaction efficiency. Furthermore, recent research studies have demonstrated that the nanomaterials with porous structure could increase the surface-to-volume ratio and the surface area of materials, and contribute to gas diffusion or mass transport in such materials compared with solid ones, resulting in enhanced performances.12,21,28–30 Therefore, the prepared layered porous ZnO sheet-like structures are expected to have great potential applications in gas sensors, photocatalysts, catalyst supports, sorbents, carriers, and solar cells.
On the other hand, in view of chemical gas sensor applications, many efforts have been made to improve the ZnO sensor performances. To date, hybrid materials have attracted great interest due to their multi-functionalities or enhanced properties derived from the combined compositions. Noble metals (Au, Pt, Pd etc.) can act as promoters to enhance the physical and chemical properties of functional materials due to their outstanding electronic and catalytic properties.21,30–36 Moreover, previous studies have shown that a well-established synthetic method could anchor noble metal NPs with small particle size and narrow size distributions on the surfaces of the MOSs,21,32,34 which is advantageous to enhance their catalytic activity. Therefore, the novel porous ZnO sheet structures functionalized by small Au NPs can combine the large accessible surface area of porous ZnO sheets and the catalytic activity of Au NPs, which is highly attractive for the development of advanced functional nanomaterials.
Herein, we present a facile hydrothermal strategy followed by a calcination process to fabricate the novel layered 2D ZnO MSs with porous structures on a large scale, without using any noxious additives or surfactants, just using zinc acetate dihydrate (Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O) and urea as the sources. The as-prepared 2D porous ZnO MSs were further functionalized by small Au NPs through a one-pot strategy with lysine as both a capping reagent and linker, and then their application as chemical gas sensors for detecting volatile organic compounds (VOCs) was investigated. The novel Au NPs-functionalized porous ZnO MS hybrid sensor exhibits significantly enhanced sensor performance, which may provide a new pathway to develop advanced sensor materials.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials
Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O, (NH2)2CO, lysine and NaBH4 were obtained from Tianjin Guangfu Fine Chemical Research Institute (Tianjin, China). HAuCl4·4H2O was purchased from Yingdaxigui Chemical Reagent Company (Tianjin, China). All the reagents were of analytical grade and were used as received without further purification. Deionized water was used throughout the experiment.
2.2. Fabrication of ZnO MSs
Typically, 1 mmol of Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O (0.2195 g) and 3 mmol of (NH2)2CO (0.1800 g) were dissolved in 30 mL of distilled water under vigorous stirring to form a clear solution. The solution was then transferred to a 50 mL teflon autoclave and maintained at 160 °C for 24 h. Afterward, the autoclave was allowed to cool down naturally to room temperature. Then white precipitate was centrifuged and washed with distilled water and absolute ethanol for 6 times alternately, and then dried at 80 °C for 12 h, so as to obtain the basic zinc carbonate (BZC) precursor. The 2D ZnO MSs were then obtained by calcining the BZC precursor at 400 °C for 4 h in a muffle furnace.
2.3. Fabrication of Au NPs-functionalized ZnO MSs
The fabrication of Au NPs-functionalized ZnO MSs was improved following a one-pot strategy in the previous reports.34,37 At room temperature, 0.0130 g of ZnO MSs, 5 mL of lysine (0.01 M) and 0.132 mL of HAuCl4 (0.01 M) aqueous solution were orderly added into 10 mL of distilled water under stirring, followed by sonication for 30 min. Especially to deserve to be mentioned, after every solid or solution was introduced into distilled water, the system was stirred for about 20 min. The color of the suspension changed from ivory white to purple after 5 mL of NaBH4 (0.01 M) aqueous solution was introduced into the reaction system, indicating that Au NPs were successfully decorated onto the porous ZnO MSs. The above system was unceasingly stirred for 2 h. Finally, the Au NPs-functionalized ZnO MSs were obtained by centrifugal separation, washed with distilled water and ethanol, and followed with drying at 80 °C for 15 h.
2.4. Characterization of materials
The structure of the samples was determined by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a Rigaku D/max-2500 diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed on a NETZSCH TG 209 thermal analysis system, at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 from room temperature to 800 °C, in a flowing nitrogen environment at a flowing rate of 10 mL min−1. The crystal morphologies of the samples were investigated using a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, 1530VP, 10 kV), a Transmission electron microscope (TEM, Holland FEI Tecnai G2 F20, 200 kV) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS).
2.5. Fabrication and measurement of the sensor
The detailed fabrication of the gas sensor and measurement can be seen in our previous studies21,22,30–36,38 and are as follows. A proper amount of the prepared ZnO sample was slightly ground together with several drops of water in an agate mortar to form a homogeneous paste. Then the paste was coated onto an alumina tube with a Ni–Cr alloy coil inserted through the tube as a heater to control the operating temperature by tuning the heating voltage, and a pair of Au electrodes and four Pt wires on both ends. Then the gas sensing tests were performed on a HW-30A gas sensing measurement system (HanWei Electronics Co., Ltd., Henan Province, China) at a relative humidity (RH) of 10–15%, which is a static system using atmospheric air as the interference gas. The sensor sensitivity is defined as Ra/Rg, where Ra is the sensor resistance in air and Rg is the sensor resistance in a target gas, respectively.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Composition and morphology
The crystal phase structure of the basic zinc carbonate (BZC) precursor and ZnO products calcined at 400 °C for 4 h was characterized by XRD, and the XRD patterns are shown in Fig. 1. The diffraction peaks of the BZC precursor in Fig. 1a can be indexed as a monoclinic hydrozincite phase [Zn5(CO3)2(OH)6], according to JCPDS card no. 19-1458. Its space group is C2/m with lattice parameters of a = 13.62 Å, b = 6.30 Å, c = 5.42 Å, β = 95°50′ and Z = 2. The diffraction peaks of the samples calcined at 400 °C (Fig. 1b) can be perfectly indexed to the hexagonal wurtzite phase of ZnO (JCPDS Card No. 36-1451), with space group P63mc and lattice parameters of a = b = 3.25 Å and c = 5.21 Å, indicating the formation of the pure phase of ZnO products after calcined at 400 °C. From Fig. 1b, it can be seen that all the diffraction peaks of the sample are apparently broad, showing that the small-sized ZnO nanocrystalline is obtained. The average diameter of particles was calculated to be 19.4 nm using Scherrer's equation based on the XRD peak broadening analysis at the (100) peak.

It is well-known that the morphology and structure of a product is largely dependent on synthetic parameters such as time, solution pH, reaction temperature, the precipitation reagent and so on. In our work, the raw materials are just Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O and (NH2)2CO, so (NH2)2CO, a familiar and facile material, is believed to play an important role in the formation of the BZC precursor. (NH2)2CO aqueous solution is commonly stable without obvious hydrolyzation, while under the hydrothermal condition, different from the direct precipitation process, the slow hydrolyzation of (NH2)2CO provides precipitators (OH−, CO32−) homogenously for Zn2+ ions (eqn (1)–(3)),39,40 which results in the uniform size distribution of the product. It is clear that (NH2)2CO acts as a dual-role agent, as both the slow-released pH adjusting agent and the provider of carbonate. (NH2)2CO + 3H2O → 2NH3·H2O + CO2(1) NH3·H2O → NH4+ + OH−(2) CO2 + 2NH3·H2O → 2NH4+ + CO32− + H2O(3) 5Zn2+ + 2CO32− + 6OH− → Zn5(CO3)2(OH)6(4)
As the precipitation reaction of Zn2+ with OH− and CO32− to form the BZC precursor (eqn (4)) proceeds, the total hydrolysis of (NH2)2CO would probably be promoted, which leads to the formation of more and more BZC precursors. ZnO with the wurtzite structure can be obtained by the subsequent calcination of the BZC precursor according to eqn (5). Zn5(CO3)2(OH)6 → 5ZnO + 3H2O + 2CO2(5)
In order to investigate the thermal conversion characteristics of the as-prepared BZC precursor, the TGA was carried out and the corresponding TG curve is presented in Fig. 2. It can be seen clearly in the TGA curve that there is a monotonic weight loss below 400 °C, with a weight loss of 25.42%, which is attributed to the decomposition of the BZC precursor into ZnO by release of H2O and CO2 (eqn (5)). This is in well accordance with the theoretical weight loss of the pyrolysis of Zn5(CO3)2(OH)6 (25.96%).

The morphologies of the products are investigated by the FESEM technique. Fig. 3a and b present the FESEM images of the BZC precursor with a hydrothermal reaction time of 24 h at 160 °C and the corresponding calcined ZnO product. Fig. 3a reveals an interesting morphology of the BZC phase consisting of 2D layered smooth sheets with length, width and thickness of, respectively, about 0.5–3 μm, 0.1–1 μm and 30–60 nm, which do not wrap around each other to form a complex 3D superstructure (microflower, microsphere etc.). The heat-treatment has a significant effect on the morphology of the ZnO MSs. After calcined at 400 °C (Fig. 3b), there are numerous small holes immersed in the MSs with the diameter mainly ranging from 7.1 to 35.7 nm and with the mean pore diameter of 21.6 nm, while the length, width and thickness of the microsheets separately decrease to about 0.3–1.6 μm, 0.1–0.8 μm and 20–45 nm, which may be resulted from the release of CO2 and H2O during the decomposition process of the BZC precursor. However, it should be pointed out that the 2D layered MS structure is still well retained without sheet-like structure collapse and wrapped.

Further detailed morphology and structure analyses of the ZnO MSs were carried out by TEM and HRTEM. TEM images (Fig. 3c) of an individual ZnO MS after calcined at 400 °C present the porous sheet-structure, and the pores are embedded in the ZnO MSs with diameters ranging from several to several ten nm. Fig. 3d displays a typical HRTEM image of a single MS. The orderly crystal lattice fringes are clearly detected and are parallel to each other. The interplanar distance between adjacent lattice planes is 0.26 nm, corresponding to the (0002) crystal planes of hexagonal wurtzite ZnO, indicating that the growth of ZnO MS occurs preferentially along the [0001] direction (c-axis).
The porous structure of the ZnO MSs after calcined at 400 °C was further confirmed by N2 adsorption–desorption analysis. As shown in Fig. 4, the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm is characteristic of type III with a H3 hysteresis loop according to the IUPAC classification, which indicates the existence of macroporous structure. The pore size distribution curve (inset of Fig. 4) reveals that the sample has a wide pore size distribution ranging from 4–150 nm, and mainly between 7–40 nm, which is in good agreement with the above discussion and TEM observations (Fig. 3b and c). Besides, the surface area of the MSs is determined to be only 10.18 m2 g−1 by the BET method. The small surface area can be attributed to the large size (several micrometres in length) and large pore size of the MSs.

On the basis of the above discussion, a possible formation mechanism for the porous ZnO MSs is suggested (Fig. 5). In the hydrothermal process, the BZC precursor NPs, primarily formed by the reaction of Zn2+ ions with the OH− and CO32− ions released by the hydrolysis of (NH2)2CO, nucleate and then start an oriented growth into layered sheet-like structures with the generation of more BZC precursors. The fabricated layered BZC MSs act as the self-template precursor, and the ZnO MSs with the wurtzite structure were obtained by the subsequent pyrolysis of the BZC precursor without deformation in morphology. The release of CO2 and H2O resulting from the thermal decomposition of the BZC precursor leads to formation of the porous structure with small particle size.

The assembly of Au NPs on porous ZnO MSs has been demonstrated by TEM techniques. Fig. 6a and b display the TEM images of Au NPs-decorated porous ZnO MSs. As shown in the images, a large amount of Au NPs (black dots) with spherical shape have been formed and highly dispersed on the surface of porous ZnO MSs. Besides, the inset in Fig. 6b shows a typical HRTEM image of a single Au nanoparticle, and the interplanar distance between adjacent lattice planes is 0.238 nm, which is ascribed to the (111) plane of face-centered cubic (fcc) Au. The Au NPs present a narrow size distribution and almost all Au particle diameters are smaller than 9 nm, with an average diameter of ca. 4.5 nm (Fig. 6c). It has been well demonstrated that the particle size of the noble metal Au NPs should have a significant effect on the properties or performances of the Au decorated or supported nanosensors.30,31 Au NPs with smaller particle size and larger density can be more highly dispersed on the ZnO MSs, and expose the active (111) facet to the reaction gases which can provide more catalytically active sites. As a result, the hybrid materials with small Au particle size can be expected to improve the gas sensing reaction, and thus enhance the sensor performances. As shown in Fig. 6d, the energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS) resulting from Fig. 6a reveals the existence of Zn, O and Au elements, confirming the successful assembly of Au NPs on ZnO MSs.
 Fig. 6  TEM (a and b) and HRTEM (inset in b) images, corresponding Au diameter distribution histogram (c), and EDS (d) of the Au NPs-functionalized ZnO MSs shown in (a). 
The assembly process of Au NPs on porous ZnO MSs is illustrated in Fig. 7. Au NPs are successfully assembled on the surface of ZnO MSs undergoing three step reactions and no pre-functionalization of the ZnO MS support is needed. In the Au NP assembly process, lysine, a green, non-toxic and novel capping agent to produce monodispersed small-sized Au NPs, serves as a bridge or a linker to connect noble metal with metal oxides.31,37,41 First, lysine molecules are absorbed on the surface of the porous ZnO MSs and weakly coordinate with Zn2+ ions. Then, AuCl4− ions link with lysine molecules. Finally, Au NPs are formed by the reduction of NaBH4 and are anchored on the surface of ZnO MSs.

3.2. Sensor performance
Ethanol, as a common VOC, is non-toxic and environmentally friendly, so it was chosen as a probe gas to investigate the effect of the operating temperature and gas concentration on gas sensing performance of the Au NPs-functionalized 2D porous ZnO MS gas sensors. Fig. 8a and b display the dynamic response–recovery curves and the corresponding sensitivity of the sensor to 20 ppm ethanol at an operating temperature of lower than 300 °C. Fig. 8a it is clear that the curves ascend or descend when ethanol vapor is in or out, indicating the n-type MOS characteristics of the hybrid sensor. It can also be seen that the hybrid sensor begins to display response at a low operating temperature of 180 °C, but a relatively longer response time of 90 s and a recovery time of 60 s, which may restrict its practical applications. Upon increasing the operating temperature from 180 to 280 °C, the response and recovery speeds are accelerated. Fig. 8b shows the sensor responses to 20 ppm ethanol concentration versus operating temperatures. It is obvious from Fig. 8b that the responses of the Au NPs-functionalized ZnO MS hybrid sensor to 20 ppm ethanol increase as the operating temperature increases from 180 to 280 °C, with the response of 1.7 at 180 °C and 4.1 at 280 °C. The sensor shows the highest response to ethanol at 280 °C, and also presents short response and recovery times at the operating temperature, so 280 °C should be considered as the optimal operating temperature in the range from 180 to 280 °C. However, considering the higher operating temperature of 280 °C, which can produce higher power consumption, and, when at 240 °C, the sensor showed an enough high response of 2.7 and an enough short response time of 50 s and the recovery time of 40 s, so the gas sensing performance at different ethanol concentrations for the hybrid sensor in air at 240 °C was also examined, in the sequence of 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500 ppm, and is depicted in Fig. 9a and b. It can be seen from Fig. 9a that the sensor shows quick response–recovery characteristics at different ethanol concentrations and the response amplitudes of the sensor are increased with increasing gas concentration from 10 to 500 ppm. Fig. 9b clearly reveals that the response increases with increasing gas concentration. The maximum response of 13.7 can be gained at 500 ppm ethanol.

 Fig. 9  Dynamic response–recovery curves (a) and corresponding responses (b) of the Au NPs-functionalized ZnO MS hybrid sensor to various ethanol concentrations at 240 °C. 
The controllable synthesis and the noble metal-doping effect of nanomaterials can both enhance the responses of ZnO sensors. Just as Y. V. Kaneti et al.42 have reported, the controllable synthesis method was used to obtain the ZnO nanoflakes with exposed (10−10), and the sensor based on that exhibited a high response of about 6.4 to 100 ppm n-butanol at 240 °C. In our research, the method of Au NP functionalization was adopted to improve ZnO sensor sensitivity. Furthermore, other VOCs besides ethanol were tested to identify the application of the Au NPs functionalized sensor at 240 °C. Fig. 10a reveals that the Au NPs-functionalized sensor shows extraordinarily high response amplitudes at 20 ppm n-butanol with a high response of 18.5, which is much better than our pure ZnO sensor and at least six times higher than to other gases, implying not only the enhanced response but also the preferable selectivity of the sensor to n-butanol. Besides, the sensor also shows response to other VOCs including methanol, acetone and benzene, indicating its potential application in detecting VOCs. Interestingly, the Au NPs functionalized sensor shows higher response to some alcohols including methanol, ethanol and n-butanol than to other gases, and the sensitivity increases with the increase of the length of the alkyl-chain of alcohols, indicating the potential application of the Au NPs functionalized sensor in detecting advanced alcohols. As shown in Fig. 10b, the responses of the sensor to various VOCs are enhanced to some extent by the Au NP functionalization.

3.3. Sensing mechanism

Fig. 11 shows the schematic illustration of the sensing mechanism of the ZnO MS sensors before (a) and after (b) functionalization of Au NPs. It is widely reported that the sensing mechanism of the n-type MOS gas sensors such as ZnO is based on the change of the electron depletion layer of the sensors,11,22 which results from the surface sensing reactions between the tested gas molecules and pre-formed chemisorbed surface oxygen species Oδ− (O2−, O− and O2−) (Fig. 11a). For the reductive tested gases such as ethanol and n-butanol, in the process of the surface sensing reactions at moderate temperature, the surface Oδ− ions can release electrons to the conduction band of the ZnO MSs, which results in an increase in the electrical conductivity (i.e. the decrease in the resistance).38,43,44 As a result, the sensor shows response to the tested gases. After the ZnO MSs were decorated by Au NPs, as shown in Fig. 10b, the sensor sensitivity is significantly increased. The excellent catalytic effect and the spillover effect of Au NPs can dissociate oxygen molecules into ion species easily, then transport and distribute the species Oδ− onto the surface of ZnO MSs (Fig. 11b) to enhance the surface sensing reactions between the tested gas molecules and surface Oδ− species, thus resulting in the improved gas sensing performance.21,30,45 Moreover, the layered 2D ZnO MS structure and the unique porous structure can also contribute to the enhanced sensor performances. On the one hand, the layered 2D ZnO MS structure could provide a highly accessible surface and numerous reactive sites on the surface of the materials. On the other hand, the unique porous structure could increase the surface-to-volume ratio and the accessible surface area of the materials to facilitate gas diffusion and mass transport.46–49 Researchers have demonstrated that the porous MOSs are promising candidates for catalysts, catalyst supports or sensor materials in that the gas diffusion or mass transport in such materials is much more convenient and effective compared with the solid ones.50–52 Our previous work has shown that the porous ZnO MS sensor exhibited enhanced responses for different ethanol concentrations compared with the commercial solid ZnO sensor.11 For example, for 10 ppm ethanol, the sensitivity of the porous ZnO MS sensor and commercial ZnO sensor is 1.6 and 1.1, respectively. The enhanced sensitivity of the porous ZnO MSs compared with that of commercial ZnO powder could be ascribed to their unique porous structure feature.
 Fig. 11  Schematic illustration of the sensing mechanism of the ZnO MS sensors before (a) and after (b) functionalization of Au NPs. 
To investigate the long-term stability of the Au-functionalized ZnO MS sensor, the gas sensing performance is evaluated once again after 205 days (about seven months). Fig. 12 shows the dynamic response–recovery curves and the corresponding response of the Au NPs-functionalized ZnO MS hybrid sensor to various ethanol concentrations at 240 °C after seven months. Compared with Fig. 9, it can be easily observed that the sensor still shows excellent response and recovery characteristics at different ethanol concentrations after seven months and no degenerative gas sensing performance emerges. This indicates that the Au NPs-functionalized ZnO MS hybrid sensor has a good long-term stability.

4. Conclusions
In conclusion, 2D layered ZnO MSs with the porous structure were successfully synthesized by using layered BZC MSs as the self-templating precursor, gained by a simple hydrothermal process of the Zn(CH3COO)2 and (NH2)2CO aqueous solution, combined with a subsequent calcination process. The unique ZnO MSs do not wrap around each other to form a complex 3D superstructure (microflower, microsphere etc.). The as-prepared porous ZnO MSs were further functionalized by small Au NPs, assembled by a facile approach using green, non-toxic lysine as a capping agent. The obtained results from gas sensing testing show that the Au NPs-functionalized porous ZnO MS hybrid sensor exhibits enhanced sensor performance towards several VOCs including n-butanol, ethanol, methanol, acetone and benzene, indicating its potential application as a gas sensor in detecting VOCs. The enhanced sensor properties are related to the unique structure of porous ZnO MSs and the active effect of small Au NPs for catalyzing sensing reactions, as well as the electronic interaction between Au and ZnO.
