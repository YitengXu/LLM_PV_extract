1. Introduction

Oxide semiconductors are eminently attractive candidates for solar photovoltaic,1 solar water photoelectrolysis2 and photocatalytic remediation3 applications. Historically, titanium dioxide (TiO2) and zinc oxide (ZnO) are the materials which really sparked worldwide interest in oxide semiconductors for the above applications. The main virtue of these oxide semiconductors relative to other types of semiconductor material candidates such as Group II–VI (e.g., CdSe, CdTe) and Group III–V (e.g., GaAs, InP) compounds is that the oxide component elements are generally both plentiful in nature (unlike Ga, In, etc) and environmentally benign (unlike e.g., Cd). The combination of materials properties required for the above applications, however, is both stringent and daunting. For example, for solar photovoltaic devices, the active semiconductor material has to have an optimal combination of optical (energy bandgap, Eg, matching the solar spectral output) and electronic (large minority carrier lifetime and long diffusion length, low surface-state density) properties.1
On the other hand, for solar water splitting, the semiconductor, in addition to the aforementioned combination of optical and electronic characteristics, has to have the conduction and valence band-edges in the aqueous medium appropriately juxtaposed relative to the redox levels for proton reduction and water oxidation respectively.2 Needless to say, the semiconductor has to be chemically inert and photochemically stable over a wide pH range. Further, the semiconductor surface has to have high electrocatalytic activity to sustain high photocurrents and large H2 generation rates.
Finally, the use of a semiconductor photocatalysts for environmental remediation applications requires that both highly reducing and highly oxidizing active species are generated at the semiconductor/medium interface.3 Thus the semiconductor conduction band-edge has to lie at a reasonably negative potential while the valence band-edge should be located at very positive potentials. Only then will the photogenerated electrons and holes have sufficient energy for either directly converting the toxic substances to environmentally benign products or for generating mediator species (usually free radicals such as ˙OH) capable of oxidizing or reducing the toxins. In addition, the photocatalyst must have all of the combination of optical, electronic, and surface characteristics listed above.
Little wonder then that we are nowhere close to finding that “magic bullet” semiconductor for the above applications. Even given the scenario that no oneoxide semiconductor will likely emerge with the optimal combination of these properties for all three of the targeted applications, we do not yet even have an ideal candidate material for any one given application. However, TiO2 comes close in that it has demonstrated an ability to split water.2 It is also capable of oxidatively decomposing toxic organic compounds and inactivating microorganisms.1,2 Further, the versatility of this material is manifest in its ability to reductively immobilize toxic metal ions from contaminated water streams.4,5 Nonetheless, a major handicap of TiO2 is its rather large optical band gap (3.0–3.2 eV); consequently, only a small fraction (∼4%) of the solar spectrum can be harnessed. Because of this fact and its rather poor electronic properties, photocatalytic process efficiencies have been disappointingly low and TiO2 is not suitable for solar photovoltaics, at least as an active light absorber material. On the other hand, this oxide has indeed found widespread use as an electron sink in efficient dye-sensitized solar cells.6
What about other oxide semiconductor candidates? Zinc oxide is widely deployed in solid-state photovoltaic solar cells as a window material. However, its applicability to solar water splitting devices and photocatalytic environmental remediation systems is hampered by its poor chemical and photochemical stability in aqueous media. The search for new oxide semiconductor candidates goes on and constitutes a vigorous area of activity in materials science research and development.2,3
It must be noted that elemental semiconductors such as Si have an advanced state of technical know-how backing it (thanks obviously to the microelectronics industry) and thus its use in the solid-state solar photovoltaics industry has a long and illustrious history.1 However, Si is very unstable in contact with aqueous media precluding its use in solar water splitting and environmental remediation applications. Its energy band gap and band-edge positions are also non-optimal for these application requirements. This Tutorial Review will focus on how combustion synthesis can play a useful role in the ongoing search for an oxide semiconductor candidate for solar energy conversion and environmental remediation applications.
2. Why combustion synthesis?

Oxide semiconductors are generally prepared by high-temperature (ceramic) routes which have another handicap for the application of these materials in the energy (especially, renewable energy) sector. A key parameter in life cycle analyses of solar energy materials and devices is the energy payback time; i.e., the time it takes for the energy needed for material synthesis to be recovered back. The energy payback time can be effectively shrunk by deploying “mild” (low-temperature) synthesis routes. Such candidates include electrodeposition,7,8chemical bath deposition (CBD),9 and sol–gel chemistry.10 Another strategy for reducing the energy payback time is to make the synthesis efficient, both in terms of energy requirement and time duration. In this regard, all the synthesis methodologies listed above suffer from requiring rather long reaction times ranging from several minutes to hours.
Self-propagating high-temperature synthesis, or simply combustion synthesis,11–13 is both energy- and time-efficient. In one process variant in combustion synthesis (see below), a solution mixture of metal precursor and an organic fuel such as urea or glycine is first dehydrated, then ignited and finally brought to combustion (see Fig. 1). Importantly, the exothermicity of the combustion reaction provides the energy requirement for the synthesis and, in some cases, temperatures in excess of 3000 °C are instantaneously attained. The thermal conditions required for self-sustaining synthetic reaction have been discussed.13 As an added bonus to the reduction in external energy input are the following features: (a) Reaction times are very short for synthesis (typically only a few seconds). (b) The high reaction temperatures, coupled with copious gas evolution during the combustion process, result in a finely dispersed and porous morphology for the synthesized product. (c) The equipment needed is simple and cost-effective. (d) Environmentally benign precursor chemicals can be used (unlike for example, in chemical vapor deposition or molecular beam epitaxy). From a chemical perspective, another attractive feature of combustion synthesis lies in its intrinsic ability to tune the solid-state chemical composition of the product by simply varying the precursor (metal salt + fuel) mixture chemistry.

Combustion synthesis is an established art in the ceramic oxides community. However, this versatile material preparation strategy has not been much on the radar of practitioners in the solar energy conversion and environmental remediation communities. This review is meant to furnish a small window into the many opportunities that exist for more widespread use of this technique for developing and designing oxide semiconductors for solar applications. Table 1 lists oxide semiconductors that have been prepared to date viacombustion synthesis. We will return to a discussion of these candidates after the process variants are briefly considered.

3. Process variants: a primer
Self-propagating high-temperature synthesis (SHS) was the name first coined by Russian researchers to denote highly exothermic processes involving metals and non-metals leading to solid-state (or even gaseous) products.11 SHS, in its original form, pertained to a chemical reaction “bed” where ignition was first initiated at one end with a heat source (heated wire, electric spark, laser beam, etc.). After initiation, the reaction front moves through the “bed” in a self-propagating mode (hence the process title) leaving in its wake the product phase. The duration of heating is markedly shorter than the combustion duration in SHS. In the ca. 30 year span since SHS was first developed, a number of process variants have evolved and, concomitantly, a bewildering array of synonymous process names have been coined. There include fire or furnace-less synthesis, gel (or sol–gel) combustion, solution combustion synthesis, self-ignited combustion process, or simply, combustion synthesis—which is the name we use in this article.

Combustion synthesis can be performed in a wide range of media including fine powders, thin films, liquids and gases. The present discussion is confined to liquid mixtures that are brought to ignition and combustion leading to a solid product (oxide semiconductor in our case). Combustion synthesis is essentially a controlled explosion carried out in a synthetic context. A close cousin of combustion synthesis is the so-called Pechini method.32 This method, in its original guise, was designed to prepare lead and alkaline earth titanates and niobates (or combinations thereof) by way of resin intermediates. On ignition of the resin, the organic portion is removed, leaving the mixed oxide product behind.32

Combustion synthesis, when carried out in the liquid state, has greatly benefited from corresponding developments in sol–gel chemistry and our improved understanding of electron transfer and redox (electrochemical) processes. Indeed, many of the metal ion precursors deployed in combustion synthesis bear an uncanny resemblance to corresponding compounds used for sol–gel or electrochemical preparation of metal oxides. In our own studies on the combustion synthesis of TiO224 or WO3,25 identical metal ion precursors were used as in the cathodic electrosynthesis33,34 of these compounds.
In one common variant of combustion synthesis, stoichiometric amounts of the fuel and the metal precursor (oxidizer) are pre-mixed together, and in solutioncombustion synthesis, solutions (most often aqueous) of the two components are utilized. However, single component variants are also known. Thus, thermal decomposition of salts (which decompose exothermically) can be utilized without the need for a separate fuel component. Examples of this “one-step” synthesis include the preparation of γ-Fe2O3 from iron hydrazine carboxylates14and the combustion synthesis of TiO2 from titanyl hydrazine carboxylate and titanyl oxalate.15,16
A more common approach involves the use of separate compounds or the oxidizer and the fuel. Fig. 1 schematically shows the sequence of steps involved in combustion synthesis as applied to solution precursors and for the specific case of TiO2 synthesis. Thus the metal ion precursor (e.g., titanyl sulfate) and the fuel solution (e.g., urea) are intimately mixed, dehydrated and ignited in a furnace. The subsequent combustion, which leaves behind a foamy mass (see Fig. 1) is then worked up to yield the final solid oxide product. An additional thermal anneal step (usually in air at temperatures in the 400–600 °C range, see below) can be incorporated if needed. Fig. 1 illustrates how simple combustion synthesis is and underlines the fact that this process is not capital-intensive unlike many of the process counterparts used, for example, by the semiconductor microelectronics community such as vapor or liquid phase epitaxy, molecular beam epitaxy, chemical vapor deposition, sputtering, etc.
The process simplicity is a virtue shared with other synthesis approaches such as electrodeposition, CBD, and sol–gel chemistry (see above). However, combustion synthesis is much more time-efficient relative to these competing alternatives. Other low-cost candidates such as spray pyrolysis (also known as the pyrosol process) suffer from vexing problems associated with clogging, the need to contain the process environment and the aerosol spray, etc.
Another crucial advantage of combustion synthesis, particularly from a solar energy and environmental application perspective, lies in its intrinsic ability to chemically modify the targeted product in situ simply by tailoring the metal ion and fuel precursor chemistry. For example, “doping” or introduction of foreign ions into the host TiO2 lattice is an effective approach to shrink its energy band gap and thus sensitize the material to visible (e.g., solar) light; this method dates back to ∼1977.2,35,36In situ strategies for chemical modification of the oxide semiconductor during combustion synthesis will be elaborated in what follows. The use of gels and additives such as glycerol in the precursor medium also offers an opportunity to tune the morphological and physico-chemical properties of the end product, although this particular aspect is not further addressed here.
The reader is referred to literature reviews on further aspects of combustion synthesis, including the mechanistic aspects and comparative features relative to the many methods available for the synthesis of ceramic oxides in general.37–39
4. Results and discussion
In this section, we summarize the lessons learnt, the data trends and the gaps in our current understanding on the combustion synthesis of oxide semiconductors.
4.1 Even the metal precursor anion matters

Zinc oxide is an important oxide semiconductor material for many applications, including varistors, piezoelectric devices, solar cell windows, UV and blue light-emitting diodes, and the like. For many of these applications, chemical modification of the oxide host is important so that its electronic and optical properties can be controlled. Thus the use of indium chloride as a co-additive in the precursor mixture consisting of zinc nitrate and urea (acting as the fuel) results in In-doped ZnO.29 This is diagnosed by powder XRD (Fig. 2) and XPS (Fig. 3) data. Diffractograms comparing the ZnO host and In-doped ZnO, as expected, do not show new lines attributable to a separate In phase. On the other hand, both the shifts in d-spacing and the full-width at half-maximum of the (100) peak diagnose In-uptake by the ZnO host and is consistent with the lattice strain imposed by In incorporation. Similarly, survey XPS data show In-uptake (Fig. 3). Subtle alterations also result in the optical absorption behavior of the doped ZnO over the 300–800 nm wavelength range (not shown) and analyses of these diffuse reflectance data yield an optical band gap of 3.02 eV for In-doped ZnO as compared with the corresponding value of 3.14 eV for the nominally undoped specimens obtained from combustion synthesis.29

On the other hand, the use of indium nitrate (in place of the chloride salt, see above) in combustion synthesis results in the formation of polytypes of (ZnO)mIn2O3, composed of alternate blocks of wurtzite ZnO with cubic bixbyite In2O3 layers.27,28 It is remarkable that a simple change in the anion results in a dramatic end result in the end-composition of the combustion-synthesized product. Clearly, the indium nitrate salt generates the corresponding oxide during the combustion process (just like zinc nitrate does). For dopant ion uptake by the host, a thermally more labile salt (which does not form an oxide by decomposition) such as chloride is preferable. Thus, the use of cadmium nitrate as a co-additive did not result in Cd uptake by the ZnO matrix.29 Any CdO initially formed presumably was subsequently lost via volatilization.
Another example of metal anion effect comes from our own work on combustion-synthesized TiO2.24 Two different anions, sulfate and nitrate, were utilized in this work and the Ti cation was present in both cases as the titanyl (TiO2+) species. While the band-edge cut-off was significantly shifted to longer wavelengths (relative to the Degussa P-25 TiO2 benchmark), the combustion-synthesized products from titanyl nitrate exhibited virtually superimposable diffuse reflectance spectra relative to the Degussa P-25 reference. The optical data in Table 2 quantify this trend. We shall see later that the wavelength shift in the cut-off (translating in turn to an effective shrinkage of the oxide band gap energy, Eg) is because of sulfur uptake (from the thiourea fuel) by the oxide host formed during the combustion reaction. On the other hand, the lack of uptake of sulfur when titanyl nitrate is used with thiourea and the lack of appreciable Eg change (Table 2) (relative to Degussa P-25 TiO2) were both puzzling and interesting. One possibility is that the combustion extent/strength and the thermal conditions are highly sensitive to the chemical identity of the titanium precursor and the fuel. Thermal analysis studies (for example, using differential scanning calorimetry or DSC) will be needed to address this possibility.

The use of titanyl sulfate as the metal precursor salt also results in significant coating (i.e., adsorption) of the combustion-generated TiO2nanoparticles by sulfate species. This is seen in high-resolution XPS data in the O1s and S2p binding energy regimes. The presence of S6+ species was noted in the S2p spectra even when urea was used as the fuel (instead of thiourea); no sulfur would have been otherwise expected on the oxide surface in this case. Consistent with this hypothesis, the sulfur signal disappeared after the urea-derived oxide nanoparticles were washed with copious amounts of distilled water.
Precedence for metal anion effects in combustion synthesis also accrues from work in other laboratories on other oxide semiconductors. Thus metallic tin (dissolved in an aqueous nitrate-citrate acid medium) and hydrated Sn(II) chloride were compared in the combustion synthesis of nanocrystalline SnO2 powders.30 The degree of exothermicity of the combustion reaction was affected by the presence of Cl− ions in the case of the gel prepared from SnCl2·2H2O modifying the “velocity of the process.”30 As a result, a higher specific surface area and lower crystallite size were found for the metallic tin precursor route. Appreciable chloride adsorption was also found on the SnO2 powder prepared from SnCl2.2H2O similar to the sulfate case discussed above for TiO2.
4.2 Effect of fuel and metal precursor
The combustion reaction can be characterized as a “redox” process wherein one component of the precursor mixture, i.e. the metal nitrate serves as the oxidizer and the organic fuel (e.g., urea) acts as a reducing agent. Besides urea, a variety of other fuels have been deployed. Many of these compounds contain nitrogen and they differ in reducing power and the amount of gases they thermally generate. Thus in the case of TiO2 (a popular oxide semiconductor in the burgeoning combustion synthesis field, Table 1), other than urea or thiourea as the fuel (see above), glycine,17–23hexamethylenetetramine,20carbohydrazide,16 or oxalyldihydrazide16,20 have been deployed.
A recent study20 compares nanocrystalline TiO2 generated from glycine (G), hexamethylene-tetramine (H), or oxalyldihydrazide (O) as the fuel. Both X-ray diffraction (XRD) as well as transmission electron microscopy (TEM) data indicated that the particle size was dependent on the fuel and increasing in the order O < H < G.20 Concomitantly, the photocatalytic activity of the resultant TiO2 for the degradation of phenol was ordered thus: G > H > O, all three samples being superior to the Degussa P-25 TiO2 benchmark.20 Interestingly, the combustion-synthesized product was yellow in color when G was used as the fuel while it was clear white with H and pale yellow with O as the fuel. Doping with carbidic species was suspected with G as the fuel and XPS evidence was presented by these authors.20

Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) data provide clear evidence for the influence of the fuel on the combustion extent or “strength”. Representative TGA traces are contained in Fig. 4 for three combustion-synthesized samples derived from titanyl sulfate. Three mass loss regimes can be discerned in the TGA data in Fig. 4 at ∼200 °C, ∼400 °C, and ∼600 °C respectively. The first mass loss regime (at ∼200 °C) is associated with thiourea while the second at ∼400 °C is assignable to the gradual loss of the organic residues remaining after combustion synthesis. The final mass loss regime at ∼600 °C is associated with the titanyl sulfate component. It is interesting that this feature is most pronounced in the sample derived from urea as the fuel and least prominent in the urea + thiourea sample. These trends again underline the fact that the combustion extent/strength is critically dependent on the identity of the fuel (as well as the titanium precursor, see above). Clearly, the samples derived from urea alone contain appreciable amounts of sulfur (from titanyl sulfate); this is also reflected in the XPS data (Table 3).

The fuel, not surprisingly, also exerts a morphological effect as may be gleaned from the study discussed above20 as well as recent findings in our own laboratory. Thus, the average size (D) of the TiO2 crystallites can be estimated by the Scherrer equation40 for well-crystallized samples:  K is a constant (0.89), λ is the Cu Kα wavelength (1.5405 Å), β is the full-width at half-maximum (FWHM in radians) and θ is the diffraction angle. Values for D thus estimated are compiled in Table 3. The data in the top two rows clearly show that the TiO2nanoparticle size is dependent on whether urea or thiourea is used as the fuel. The values in Table 3 pertain to titanyl sulfate as the metal ion precursor. For comparison, combustion-synthesized TiO2 samples from titanyl nitrate + glycine have crystallite sizes variously reported as 6 nm,20 8 ± 2 nm,17 and 10 ± 2 nm.18 It may be noted that in all these cases, the nanoparticles are significantly smaller than those of the Degussa P-25 benchmark. The crystalline size in Degussa P-25 TiO2 is in the 20–30 nm range.20,41
Similar trends on the effect of fuel were also noted in the case of WO3 (see below) although the available data are much less extensive and are limited to the one study to date in our laboratory.25 In general, there is a critical need for detailed thermal analysis studies (e.g., viaDSC) on the effect of fuel on the combustion process. The choice of fuel opens up the possibility to bring about in situ chemical modification of the oxide host. This is exemplified by the data below on the use of thioureavs.urea as the fuel for the combustion synthesis of nanocrystalline TiO2.
4.3 
          In situ chemical modification of the oxide host with non-metals and metals during combustion synthesis
As underlined in the introductory paragraphs, a crucial advantage with combustion synthesis is the ability to alter the chemical make-up of the synthesized material in situ simply by changing the precursor solution mixture. The set of three photographs in Fig. 5 contrast a benchmark sample of TiO2 from commercial sources (Degussa P-25) (Fig. 5a) with one combustion-synthesized from titanyl sulfate + thiourea (Fig. 5b) and another with 5 wt% MoCl5 additionally present in the above precursor mixture (Fig. 5c). Clearly, the TiO2 samples have been chemically modified in the combustion-synthesized samples relative to the white pigmentation commonly observed for this compound in its pristine state (Fig. 5a). Insights into the chemical modification are furnished by optical, X-ray diffraction, and surface analysis (XPS) data as elaborated below.
 Fig. 5  Photographs of samples of: (a) Degussa P-25 TiO2 benchmark; (b) a combustion-synthesized TiO2 sample derived from thiourea; and (c) another combustion-synthesized TiO2 sample co-modified with Mo and S. 

Combustion-synthesized TiO2 samples using thiourea as the fuel have a bright yellow hue (Fig. 5b) while those additionally containing Mo had a darker (brownish) appearance (Fig. 5c). On the other hand, if titanyl nitrate was used in place of the sulfate salt for Ti precursor, the samples had a pale grey hue (not shown). Fig. 6 shows Tauc plots (constructed from diffuse reflectance data)42 for the various samples from combustion synthesis and compared/contrasted with the Degussa P-25 benchmark TiO2 sample. Optical band gap energy values (Eg) obtained from the intercepts of these plots42 are compiled in Table 2. The values for Eg are significantly smaller than those for the benchmark specimen except when titanyl nitrate is used (regardless of the fuel) when virtually identical Eg values are obtained in the ∼3.0 eV range.

Sample notation as in Fig. 4. (b) Corresponding samples containing also 5 wt% MoCl5 in the combustion reaction: SU-Mo, ST-Mo and SUT-Mo. Only the low-energy optical transition is considered in Fig. 6b. 
This bandgap shrinkage is a highly sought-after characteristic of TiO2 because a major handicap of this otherwise optimal oxide semiconductor for solar applications is its inadequate visible light photoresponse (see above). On the other hand, the highly colored nature of the combustion-synthesized TiO2 samples immediately signals their strong visible light absorption tendency.
What is the underlying cause of this visible light sensitization? There is extensive literature on this topic (some of it controversial, see, for example, ref. 43) albeit for TiO2 synthesized by methods other than combustion synthesis. Thus chemical modification of TiO2 with metal ions has been shown to result in shrinkage of its band gap.2 The use of non-metallic elements (e.g., sulfur, carbon, nitrogen) for this purpose has much more recent history.2,44,45

The Ti2p high-resolution spectra in Fig. 7a show the spin–orbit peak-splitting pattern with the Ti2p3/2 and Ti2p1/2 signals separated by ∼5.6–5.7 eV. Focusing only on the Ti2p3/2 component, the peaks for all the three combustion-synthesized samples are shifted towards higher binding energies relative to the Degussa P-25 TiO2 case (Fig. 7a and Table 4). Two points are worthy of note here: (a) The Ti2p3/2 signal in TiOSO4 (see Table 4) also appears shifted (albeit to a greater extent) reflecting the presence of S6+ species and Ti–O–S interactions (see below). (b) Significantly, the low-energy Ti2p3/2 signal in TiS2 appears at 455.8 eV (Table 4) reflecting electronic interaction from Ti–S bonding. This component is completely absent in the three combustion-synthesized samples reflecting the absence of anionic S2− species (see below). Interestingly, there is a Ti3+ component appearing at 456.8 eV for Degussa P-25 TiO2 (note the pronounced low-energy tail of the Ti2p3/2 peak in Fig. 7a) (Table 4) which is absent in the three combustion-synthesized samples.
Turning to the O1s core level spectra (Fig. 7b and 8a), the major trends are the diminution of the parent band at 529.5 eV present for Degussa P-25 TiO2 with a shift towards higher binding energies and the appearance of a new feature at ∼532.8 eV for the three combustion-synthesized samples. An intermediate feature at ∼530 eV is assignable to O2− (Ti–O bonded) species (Table 4). Fig. 8a contains an example of deconvolution for the SUT sample; the lower binding energy peak (represented by I) is related to oxygen in the oxide while the peak at higher binding energy (peak III) can be attributed to oxygen from the sulfate groups. The component II is assigned to OH−groups adsorbed on the surface. Interestingly, the higher binding energy O1s feature is also present in TiOSO4 (Table 4) and is assignable to oxygen bonded to sulfur. Finally, a peak component (at ∼531.5 eV) assignable to OH− species is present at much higher levels in the three combustion-synthesized samples relative to Degussa P-25 TiO2 (Table 4). This last trend is consistent with the XPS observations of previous authors20 for TiO2 synthesized from the combustion of titanyl nitrate + glycine mixture. They also reported evidence for a higher content of surface hydroxyl groups in combustion-synthesized samples (relative to Degussa P-25 TiO2) as seen by TGA.21
The most direct evidence for sulfur uptake in the combustion-synthesized TiO2 samples and its oxidation state accrues from high-resolution S2p core level spectra (Fig. 7c). Comparison with the XPS data for TiS2 and physical mixture of TiO2 and elemental sulfur (Table 4) conclusively demonstrates that neither elemental sulfur nor S2− species are present in the combustion-synthesized TiO2 samples. Given that the spin–orbit coupled S2p1/2 and S2p3/2 peaks are not completely resolved (Fig. 7c), both S4+ and S6+ cationic sulfur species are present in the combustion-synthesized samples (Table 4). Previous authors have discussed an evolution of the sulfur species in TiO2 from S2− to S6+ + S4+ and finally to S4+ depending on the pre-treatment and thermal history for S-modified oxide samples prepared by a slurry method.47
Precedence for the incorporation of cationic sulfur species may be found in TiO2 synthesized and doped by other wet chemical methods (e.g., ref. 47). Cationic S-doped TiO2 was postulated to absorb visible light more strongly than anionic S (e.g., S2−) doped samples.47 Interestingly, the use of thiourea as a dopant was found to result in the substitution of Ti4+ lattice sites by S6+ species.47 This doping mechanism was claimed to be more favorable than replacing O2− with S2−.
In none of the combustion-synthesized samples in our study (including when titanyl nitrate was used as the titanium precursor) was XPS evidence for carbon or nitrogen doping observed in spite of careful attempts. For example, a lower binding energy (284.3 eV) feature in the C1s core spectra, which was assigned to a carbidic species,20 was not seen in any of the samples in this particular study; only the 285.5 eV feature assignable to elemental carbon and arising from adventitious carbon contamination (from grease, for example) was consistently seen. Similarly, the N1s peak at 396 eV diagnostic of N substituting for O at anion sites in the TiO2 lattice44 was not seen for combustion-synthesized samples derived from either titanyl nitrate or titanyl sulfate and urea as fuel.
It was of interest to examine the applicability of combustion synthesis for chemically modifying TiO2 with both metallic and non-metallic (e.g., S) species. For this purpose, Mo-doped TiO2 samples simultaneously modified with sulfur (as above) were studied. To our knowledge, XPS data on Mo-doped TiO2 are limited to one study.48 In this particular study, high valence dopant cations (Mo5+, Nb5+, W6+) were found to be beneficial to the photocatalytic activity of sol–gel TiO2 thin films for trichloroethylene oxidation.48

          No changes were seen in the Ti2p core level in our study on Mo addition. High-resolution scans in the Mo3d core level region revealed a broad peak which could be deconvoluted into three sets of spin–orbit coupled 3d3/2–3d5/2 doublets corresponding to the Mo(IV), Mo(V), and Mo (VI) oxidation states. Fig. 8b contains a representative spectrum for TiO2combustion-synthesized from titanyl oxysulfate and urea + thiourea as fuel. The Mo3d core level region shows a complex structure that after deconvolution reveals spin–orbital splitting for the multiple Mo oxidation states ranging from Mo4+ through Mo6+ (Fig. 8b). Importantly, no signals for the elemental state of Mo (binding energy: 228–229 eV, ref. 46) were seen in any of the combustion-synthesized products. The O1s core level spectra also did not show significant changes in the Mo incorporated samples while examination of the S2p core level spectra showed no evidence for MoS2 formation.

X-Ray diffraction data provide further evidence for sulfur incorporation into the TiO2 lattice. Table 3 presents the values for the TiO2 unit cell lattice parameters (a and c) computed from the measured d-spacings. Unfortunately, no unit cell lattice parameter values are available for comparison in reports of S-doped TiO2 prepared by other methods. Some variation relative to undoped TiO2 (e.g., Degussa P-25) is to be expected as a result of incorporation of other ions (e.g., S4+, see above) into the TiO2 lattice because of ionic radii differences and lattice strain. This trend is indeed seen in combustion-synthesized and metal-doped TiO2 cases.17,22 On the other hand, the ionic radii of Mo6+ and Ti4+ are very similar, 62 pm and 68 pm, respectively.49 In agreement, the values of a and c are very similar with or without Mo as co-additive (Table 3).
Other than the case of Mo incorporation as discussed above, previous authors have incorporated a variety of other metals into TiO2 during combustion synthesis. These include Pt, Cu, and Mn in one study17 and W, V, Ce, Zr, Fe, and Cu22 in a later study by the same group. Appropriate amounts of the metal salt solution were simply added to the precursor Ti salt–fuel (usually glycine) mixture for this purpose like the case of Mo incorporation in our laboratory (see above). The choice of the metal “dopants” in these studies was dictated by their oxidation states being either lower valent (Cu2+, Fe3+), isovalent (Ce4+, Zr4+, Pt4+, Mn4+) or higher valent (W6+, V5+) than the Ti4+ host. XRD and Raman studies of these metal-modified samples showed no significant variations in the particle size, crystallinity, and crystal structure relative to the undoped TiO2 samples.17,22
On the other hand, metal “doping” had a significant effect on the optical absorption characteristics of the TiO2host. For example, Fe- and Cu-modified TiO2 had absorption thresholds corresponding to Eg values of 2.18 eV and 2.65 eV respectively.22 We shall consider the photocatalytic activity of metal-modified (and chemically modified) TiO2 samples in a subsequent section below.
Examples of in situ chemical modification of other oxide semiconductors are confined to our study of WO3 referenced earlier.25Fig. 9 contains Tauc plots for combustion-synthesized WO3 using three different fuels, namely, glycine (G), urea (U), or thiourea (T) compared with the corresponding plot obtained for a commercial specimen (B). The combustion-synthesized samples are visually darker than the yellow hue of the commercial WO3 powder. This is also borne out by the optical data in Fig. 9. As in the case of TiO2 discussed earlier, XPS data on the combustion-synthesized WO3 are consistent with the uptake of carbon (G), nitrogen (G, U, or T), and sulfur (T) by the oxide host. Note that the chemical modification in these cases was unintentional except in the thiourea case where sulfur incorporation was entirely to be expected.
 Fig. 9  
            Tauc plots for four WO3 samples (B, G, U, and T) obtained for the diffuse reflectance data shown in the inset. B is a commercial sample and G, U and T are combustion-synthesized samples using glycine (G), urea (U) or thiourea (T) as fuel respectively. Reproduced from ref. 25 with copyright permission (American Chemical Society). 
Another example of serendipitous incorporation of carbon as a dopant may be found in an early study on TiO2combustion synthesis using glycine as a fuel.20 Thus the yellow-colored TiO2 sample obtained in this case was assigned to carbon incorporated as a carbidic species. On heating the sample in a furnace for 48 h at 400 °C, the color reverted from yellow to white and a low binding energy (284.3 eV) C1s XPS peak correspondingly vanished.20
In summing up the available body of data on in situ chemical modification of oxide semiconductors during combustion synthesis, it is reasonable to state that we have only barely “scratched the surface.” The full power of this technique in this regard remains yet to be realized. Studies on a variety of other oxide hosts extending beyond TiO2 and WO3 and utilizing modification agents other than the metal or non-metal species discussed above undoubtedly will prove to be a fertile topic for study.
4.4 Morphological and crystal structure aspects
Consider TiO2 first. As-prepared combustion synthesis products are amorphous and XRD-silent. The samples derived from titanyl sulfate and either thiourea or urea + thiourea as fuel, become crystalline after thermal anneal at 450 °C. Fig. 10 maps the changes in sample crystallinity with anneal temperature for the latter case. For comparison, the diffractogram for Degussa P-25 TiO2 is also shown. Interestingly, combustion synthesis appears to favor anatase phase formation; the peaks corresponding to the minor rutile component in Degussa P-25 TiO2 are completely absent in the combustion-synthesized product (Fig. 10). This behavior is even more markedly seen for the sample derived from urea as the fuel where rutile formation is inhibited even after heating to temperatures higher than ∼750 °C. Contrastingly, rutile appears as the dominant phase when Degussa P-25 TiO2 is similarly thermally treated as demonstrated by the Raman spectroscopy data in Fig. 11.50
 Fig. 10  
Powder X-ray diffraction patterns mapping the changes in sample crystallinity with anneal temperatures of 450 °C and 750 °C for combustion-synthesized TiO2 samples derived from titanyl sulfate and urea + thiourea as fuel. The XRD pattern of Degussa P-25 TiO2 is included for comparison. The peaks with asterisks in the top frame correspond to the rutile phase present as a minor component in Degussa P-25 TiO2. 
 Fig. 11  
Raman spectra of Degussa P-25 TiO2 particles after being subjected to thermal anneal at 450, 600, 650, 700 and 800 °C. Schematic crystallographic structures of anatase (top right) and rutile (bottom left) are also shown. Reproduced from ref. 50 with copyright permission (Elsevier Publishing Co). 
Interestingly, after a thermal anneal at 450 °C, some residual carbon (as diagnosed by the XRD peak at 25–27°, bottom frame in Fig. 10) is seen for the combustion-synthesized samples. This carbon was presumably formed during the combustion reaction; it can be removed by heating at higher temperatures (e.g., 750 °C). Note that the carbon feature in the XRD pattern disappears in this case (middle frame, Fig. 10).

          Bismuth vanadate (Table 1) is an interesting photocatalyst whose activity strongly depends on the crystal structure. The monoclinic structure shows high photocatalytic activity because of its relatively narrow band gap of 2.4 eV as compared to the tetragonal phase (3.1 eV). In a recent study,31 the ratio of fuel:oxidizer was systematically varied from 3 to 5. The intensity of the XRD peaks was found to increase with this ratio indicating an increase in the degree of crystallinity of the combustion-synthesized BiVO4 samples. Interestingly enough, the crystallites were spherical-shaped with sizes in the 400–600 nm range (as assessed by FE-SEM); in contrast, BiVO4 crystallites prepared by solid-state chemical synthesis exhibit irregular morphology with a much larger particle size (∼1.5 μm).31
The specific surface areas of the oxides formed in combustion synthesis have been reported in many cases; Table 5 contains a compilation of reported values. These values are derived from the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) model51 usually using nitrogen as an adsorption probe. It must be borne in mind that the adsorption probe itself influences the surface area accessed; for example, such variability has been noted for nitrogen and a dye (methylene blue) as the adsorption probes for TiO2 prepared by other methods.52 Notwithstanding this factor, the surface area values reported vary considerably (Table 5) although they are generally higher than corresponding values for oxides prepared by other methods. For example, the Degussa P-25 benchmark sample has a specific area of ∼55 m2/g.42

The advent of time-resolved XRD (TR-XRD) has facilitated direct in situ monitoring of the dynamics of phase transformations and structure evolution during SHS.53 While TR-XRD has been profitably employed for the study of non-semiconductor systems (e.g., Ti + B + C) during SHS, its application to the monitoring of combustion synthesis of oxide semiconductors remains a hitherto unexplored and potentially rich avenue for exploration.
It is worth noting that the expectation of high crystallinity in the combustion-synthesized product (arising from the high reaction temperatures transiently attained) is not always borne out in practice. This trend is manifest in the XRD data in Fig. 10 for TiO2 and in Fig. 12 for the Bi–V–O system.54 Note that in both cases, the as-synthesized products are poorly crystalline and significant crystallinity is not attained until the samples are subjected to a post-synthesis thermal anneal at temperatures around 600 °C. Clearly, the samples during combustion synthesis had not been exposed to a temperature high enough after their formation for significant crystallinity to evolve. Once again, in situ studies using TR-XRD ought to shed useful light on this aspect. The variability noted above with surface area and particle size is presumably rooted in the same thermal factors as for the sample crystallinity.

4.5 Photocatalytic activity of combustion-synthesized oxide samples
While the oxide semiconductors combustion-synthesized (as discussed above) have been almost exclusively n-type semiconductors, the photocatalytic activity of the resultant product can be probed both via the photogenerated holes (oxidation reactions) and using electrons (reduction reactions).55 This is because for an irradiated semiconductor (nano)particle at open circuit, the two current branches (oxidation and reduction) have to exactly balance each other much like a corroding system at open circuit.55 Thus, high photocatalytic activity translates to fast oxidation as well as fast reduction on the irradiated semiconductor surface. Consider the latter first where Cr(VI) functions as an effective probe.4

Fig. 13a contains data for TiO2 samples derived from titanyl sulfate and using urea, thiourea, or urea + thiourea as fuel and for three Mo- and S-co-modified TiO2 samples. Degussa P-25 TiO2 was included as a comparison “benchmark” standard in these experiments. Simultaneous incorporation of both Mo and S into TiO2 results in a drastic improvement in the photocatalytic activity of combustion-synthesized TiO2 relative to the benchmark specimen. Thus all three Mo-containing samples (i.e., those derived from urea, thiourea or urea + thiourea as fuel) outperform the Degussa P-25 TiO2 benchmark specimen, and in the case of the SUT-Mo sample, all of the initial Cr(VI) is converted in ∼3 h (Fig. 13b).
 Fig. 13  (a) Photocatalytic conversion plots for methylene blue for combustion-synthesized TiO2 samples simultaneously incorporating Mo and S and for three fuels, thiourea (ST), urea (SU) and a mixture of urea and thiourea (SUT). (b) Bar plot showing the residual fraction of Cr(VI) remaining after 4 h of visible light irradiation using an initial concentration of 800 μM Cr(VI) and 2 g/L TiO2 dose of combustion-synthesized samples prepared without (ST and SUT) and with co-doped Mo (ST + Mo and SUT + Mo). TiO2 (Degussa P-25) is included for comparison. 
It must be emphasized that all the photocatalysis data in Fig. 13 pertain to visible light excitation. The benchmark Degussa P-25 TiO2 sample has negligible visible light absorption in this wavelength range. The superior photocatalytic activity of the Mo- and S-containing combustion-synthesized TiO2 samples can be rationalized on optical (visible light activity), morphological (finer crystallite size), surface chemical (high OH− concentration on the oxide surface), and structural (stabilization of the anatase TiO2 phase) grounds.

Table 6 provides a compilation of studies aimed at evaluating the photocatalytic activity of combustion-synthesized oxide semiconductors. While the vast majority of studies have focused (perhaps not surprisingly) on TiO2, other oxides such as BiVO4 have been examined as well. In summation of the results discussed in this section, it can be concluded, that in the vast majority of instances, the combination of favorable attributes such as lower band gap, higher surface hydroxyl group density, finer particle size (higher surface area) and stabilization of photocatalytically-active crystal phases (e.g., anatase for TiO2, monoclinic for BiVO4) results in higher photocatalytic activity (often by an order of magnitude) for the combustion-synthesized samples relative to counterparts prepared by other methods.

5. Conclusions and perspectives
In this review article, we have attempted to chart the significant progress in combustion synthesis as applied to oxide semiconductors for targeted use in the solar energy conversion and environmental remediation areas. While this progress over the past ∼15 years has been impressive, significant gaps remain in our understanding of the dynamics of product and structure evolution in a combustion environment. The influence of fuel on the combustion “strength” for a given metal precursor also remains to be quantified. As noted in the earlier paragraphs, techniques such as TR-XRD and thermal analysis (particularly, differential scanning calorimetry or DSC) can play a very useful role in this regard. Methods coupling evolved gas analysis (e.g., mass spectrometry) with the above techniques will also prove to be powerful. The value of these tools is enhanced by their amenability for study of the combustion synthesis process in an in situ mode. In other instances (e.g., DSC or TGA), the combustion synthesis environment can be simulated by heating of the precursor fuel + oxidizer mixture while simultaneously monitoring the enthalpy or mass changes, respectively.
The range of oxide semiconductors generated by combustion synthesis remains as yet quite limited (Table 1). It is our hope that this review will spur new practitioners (beyond the materials science and ceramic communities) to examine the potential of this simple and versatile synthesis technique for preparing a more extended range of oxide semiconductors for solar and environmental applications. In particular, the possibility of adapting combustion synthesis to a combinatorial framework for screening a large library of binary, ternary or even higher oxide candidates is exciting. The photocatalytic activity of these candidates (as probed, for example, by dye discoloration) can be used as a response parameter for this combinatorial screening exercise. In this regard, the foregoing discussion should have indicated that not much is yet known about the photocatalytic activity of combustion-synthesized oxides for hydrogen generation from water.2 This is in contrast to the extensive body of data that exists on the photocatalytic activity of these materials for photo-oxidatively or photo-reductively destroying environmental pollutants (see Table 6). A major gap in the literature pertains to the need for careful quantification of foreign ions incorporated into the host oxide lattice and studies on how they impact on its photocatalytic activity and water-photosplitting ability.
In this regard, it is worth noting that this is an area of research that is very much nascent. The fact that combustion synthesis is quick (spanning only seconds to minutes) makes it ideally suited for time-efficient screening of a large number of oxide compositions. The successful search for a magic bullet in terms of the perfect semiconductor for solar hydrogen generation2 or environmental remediation3 will likely hinge on such innovative combinations of combustion synthesis and an efficient chemical composition–photocatalytic activity screening protocol.
