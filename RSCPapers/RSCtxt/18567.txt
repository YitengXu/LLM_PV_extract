1. Introduction
Tungsten oxide is one of the typically and widely explored n-type transition metal oxide semiconductors. The interest in tungsten oxide can be traced back to the 18th century for wolframite, and this interest is still intense even after more than two hundred years owing to the structural diversity of tungsten oxide and its derivatives.1 Tungsten oxide possesses a widely tunable optical bandgap of ca. 2.5–3.7 eV, and this characteristic has led to the intensive investigation of tungsten oxide for photo(electro)catalysts, photochromics and phototherapy, which are timely and thoroughly reviewed.1–17
The structural diversity and defect variety of tungsten oxide as a functional film also initiate widespread applications in fields from optoelectronics and ionics to iontronics, such as photodetectors,18 electrochromic devices,19 supercapacitors,20 memristors,21 and electrolyte-gated transistors,22 which hold great promise and opportunities for next-generation devices.
In the aspect of optoelectronics, tungsten oxide has generally emerged in the field of UV photodetection as a promising candidate.23 A fast response time and high photoresponsivity have been achieved in tungsten oxide UV photodetectors in recent years.24,25 However, the functionality of tungsten oxide for UV detection is rarely reviewed and summarised.
The ionic property of tungsten oxide has long been sought for electrochromic devices.26 Due to the configuration and mechanism similarity, tungsten oxide supercapacitors also attract considerable attention. Substantial progress has been made recently including an in-depth understanding of working mechanisms, novel device configurations and applications.27–29 The development in these fields is rapid and need to be timely reviewed.
Based on the excellent electronic and ionic properties, the concept of iontronics offers a fresh new approach for device design, which brings more functionalities to tungsten oxide. The exploration of tungsten oxide memristors and electrolyte-gated transistors represents the most exciting frontline in the development of novel tungsten oxide devices for the next generation.30–32
This review offers a progress report on nanostructured tungsten oxide thin film devices from optoelectronics and ionics to iontronics. The review first introduces recent findings on the structural, defect, and ion intercalation aspects of tungsten oxide, which are fundamental to the understanding of tungsten oxide devices and the development of novel devices. The review focuses on reviewing nanostructured tungsten oxide thin film devices from optoelectronics and ionics to iontronics with emphasis on the recent work of photodetectors, electrochromic and supercapacitive devices, memristors, and electrolyte-gated transistors. The development trends, challenges, and opportunities are analysed and proposed. We envisage that the review will be beneficial not only for research on tungsten oxide but also for that on optoelectronic, ionic and iontronic devices and other functional metal oxide semiconductors such as TiO2, MoO3 and V2O5.
2. Structural and morphological diversity
Tungsten trioxide crystals consist of WO6 octahedra linked by corner and edge sharing. The corner-sharing phases account for most of the tungsten trioxide phases, such as monoclinic II (ε-WO3), triclinic (δ-WO3), monoclinic I (γ-WO3), orthorhombic (β-WO3), tetragonal (α-WO3), and cubic WO3, as shown in Fig. 1.33 The different phases can be mutually transformed under different temperatures, while γ-WO3 appears to be the most common and stable phase at room temperature. As the ε-WO3 phase only exists at very low temperature, monoclinic WO3 normally refers to γ-WO3 unless specified.

Another commonly studied tungsten trioxide is hexagonal WO3(h-WO3), which has aroused fast-growing interest in electrochemical applications.34 It is stable at room temperature and can be transformed into the monoclinic phase after annealing at a temperature of over 400 °C. The h-WO3 phase also constitutes of corner-sharing octahedral units but forming hexagonal and trigonal tunnels with six- and three-grouped units at the ab plane and repeated layers coordinated by corner-oxygen along the c axis. This structure offers a high surface area originating from 3.67 Å diameter hexagonal tunnels along the (001) direction, which creates easy access for H+ and Li+ and facilitates ion transfer (Fig. 2).35

In addition to the aforementioned tungsten trioxide structures, tungsten trioxide hydrate is also a big group of the tungsten oxide family. Tungsten trioxide hydrate includes a variety of crystal structures and phases with different water contents, from orthorhombic WO3 2H2O to different semi-dehydrated structures and phases, and all can be transformed to monoclinic WO3 with heating over 400 °C (Fig. 3).36 It is noteworthy that most of the tungsten trioxide hydrates possess layered structures.

Tungsten oxide can be synthesized into many different morphologies like other transition metal oxides, which will not be comprehensively introduced here.11,14,37 Moreover, many synthesis techniques from other transition metal oxides were also adapted to produce various tungsten oxides, such as the sol–gel,38 hydro/solvothermal,39–41 exfoliation,42 sputtering,43 chemical vapour deposition,44 and atomic layer deposition techniques.45–47 We specifically introduce three promising morphological engineering approaches for functionalization of tungsten oxide: two-dimensional (2D) flakes, quantum dots (QDs) and porous structures. 2D tungsten oxide should be particularly mentioned, as it holds great potential for tuning the electronic structures of tungsten oxide.48–50 Compared to the bulk counterpart, 2D tungsten oxide has a larger bandgap and more positive conduction and valence band edges due to the quantum confinement effect.51–53 The annealing process of 2D tungsten oxide could also result in the variation of band structures (Fig. 4a and b).54 Both the hydration and crystallinity contribute greatly to the electronic properties of 2D tungsten oxide.55 It's worth noting that not much work has been carried out so far on 2D tungsten oxide compared to other common morphologies due to the intrinsic 3D network structures of tungsten oxide. However, high-quality 2D tungsten oxide can be exfoliated from layered tungsten oxide hydrates. The work on tungsten oxide QDs is even less.5,56–58 Wang et al. reported tungsten oxide QDs hydrothermally prepared with an average size of 3.25 ± 0.25 nm (Fig. 4c and d). The tungsten oxide QDs can be dispersed in aqueous medium and exhibit excellent photoluminescence properties.59 The strong capability of quantum dots to modulate the optical properties endorses their applications in tungsten oxide optoelectronic devices.

The pore-rich morphology of tungsten oxide is of critical importance for electrochemical applications. Liu et al. synthesized pore-rich WO3 ultrathin nanosheets with a ca. 3.8 nm thickness (Fig. 5a and b).60 The charge transfer resistance (240 Ω) for pore-rich WO3 was decreased dramatically compared to those of nonporous nanosheet (680 Ω) and bulk (1200 Ω) WO3, respectively. The flat band potential and carrier density were derived from the Mott–Schottky plots (Fig. 5c). The positive slopes in the plots indicated the n-type nature of the WO3 samples. The donor concentration of 1.34 × 1020 cm−3 was three times higher than that of bulk WO3, promoting the charge transport efficiency. From the band structure (Fig. 5d and e), the flat band potential position was approximately equal to the position of the conduction band for the n-type semiconductor. The negatively shifted flat band potential depressed the charge carrier recombination by enhancing band bending at the surface. The space charge layer thickness was calculated to be 4.17 nm at 1.0 V versus Ag/AgCl, exceeding the thickness of the WO3 nanosheets, proving the full depletion of nanosheets and thus promoting efficient photoexcited carrier separation under an applied voltage (Fig. 5f).60

3. Various defects and defect-induced phenomena
The electronic properties of tungsten oxide are strongly dependent on its stoichiometry, i.e., the concentration of oxygen deficiency. A higher concentration of oxygen vacancies induces semiconducting-to-metallic properties. A vacancy concentration of 4% (WO3−x, x = 0.12) results in the metallic state of tungsten oxide, as compared to the semiconducting state for tungsten oxide with a vacancy concentration of 2% (WO3−x, x = 0.06).61 Oxygen vacancies in tungsten oxide crystals have an anisotropic nature: W6+/Vo(2e−)/W6+ with two trapped electrons along the x-direction, W4+/Vo(0e−)/W6+ along the y-direction, and W5+/Vo(0e−)/W5+ along the z-direction (Fig. 6a).61 The anisotropic oxygen vacancies give rise to the anisotropic electronic properties of tungsten oxide.

The –W–O–W– chains without and with oxygen vacancies in the x, y, and z directions. The distances are shown in Å. (b) Schematic of the band structure of tungsten oxide at different charge states from single particle eigenvalues, and schematic of the electronic transitions and their calculated values via HF15LYP and B3LYP. TIE, PL, εopt, and εtherm stand for thermal ionization energy, photoluminescence, and optical and thermodynamic transition energy levels, respectively.

Oxygen vacancies with charge states of 0 and +1 were proposed to create optical transition levels within the bandgap, while the defect states of doubly charged oxygen vacancies lie in the CB band, thus leading to different light absorption spectra (Fig. 6b).61 Additionally, the migration of oxygen vacancies was also calculated to be anisotropic.62 More calculation and experimental work on the anisotropic effects of oxygen vacancies in WO3 needs to be conducted to give more detailed information on the variation of the electronic and optical properties.63–67
The surface of monoclinic WO3 was predicted to have 2D delocalized excess charges at the very first layer due to the surface vacancies naturally originating from the termination of the crystal structure (Fig. 7).68 The 2D excess charges were concluded to be 2D large polarons with a diameter of ca. 1 nm, and their localization is dependent on the vacancy concentration on the WO3 surface (Fig. 7b). The polaronic state on the surface could promote the formation of reactive OH˙ at the WO3/water interface, which is conducive to water catalysis. Density functional theory calculations proved that doping Mo atoms on the (200) surface of tungsten oxide also favours water catalysis.69

The defects in tungsten oxide can induce many phenomena, such as localized surface plasmon resonances (LSPRs). LSPR is the phenomenon that free charge carriers dielectrically confined to a nanoparticle at sufficient density participate in resonant and collective oscillations. LSPR in transition metal oxides arising from the unique character of the outer-d valence electrons is more appealing than that in noble metals due to the adjustable LSPR energy from tuning the doping or stoichiometry degree.70 The electrical and optical properties of WO3−x with 0 < x < 0.1 result from the localized electrons involved in polarons, which are quasiparticles consisting of a charge carrier and its polarization field in a lattice. As x > 0.1, WO3 undergoes an insulator-to-metal transition due to the overlapping of the localized polaronic wave functions, forming delocalized states of electrons.71
However, the investigation of WO3−x at the nanoscale is still controversial; WO2.72 nanowires were proved to be semiconducting and the blue colour was due to polaron hopping, whereas WO2.83 nanowires appeared to be metallic and the blue colour was proved to originate from strong LSPR with an absorption peak centred at ca. 900 nm (Fig. 8a).72 LSPR was also observed in ordered mesoporous WO2.83 featuring an absorption peak at ca. 650 nm with a free charge density of 9.79 × 1021 cm−3 calculated according to the Drude model (Fig. 8b).73 The absorption peak wavelength of W18O49 originating from the LSPR effect could be tuned by the electromagnetic oscillation coupling between the metallic ultrafine W18O49 nanowires.74 WO18O49 nanowire bundles with highly oriented ultrafine nanowires showed a blue shift of the LSPR peak as the nanowires aggregated into thicker bundles. The LSPR peak centred within the IR range (1025 nm) can shift to the visible light range (561 nm) (Fig. 8c), which could be beneficial for the sensitivity improvement of non-noble metal surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy.

Actually, many behaviours of tungsten oxide are attributed to its defects (including ion intercalation, which will be specifically elaborated in the next section), even at a very low concentration. The negative differential resistance (NDR) phenomenon, in which the current decreases upon the increase of voltage, was found in WO3 and WO3·H2O.75 WO3·H2O and WO3 exhibited NDR peaks at 2.4 and −2.3 V with a peak to valley ratio of ca. 1.3 and ca. 1.5 at positive and negative bias, respectively (Fig. 9a and b). The phenomenon was explained by the reversible charge trapping/detrapping mechanism at the bridged oxygen atoms (Fig. 9c). The generation and annihilation processes of the defects were explained by band theory, where an applied bias matching the valence band and conduction band produces increased current flow, whilst an applied bias mismatching the band structure causes decreased current flow. However, this phenomenon has not been thoroughly investigated due to the complexity of defects and their low concentration. Whether it is related to intrinsic defects or voltage-induced defects is still unknown.

Lattice mismatch-induced strain could also result in the formation of an oxygen vacancy gradient in tungsten oxide perpendicular to the interface as proved in WO3/SrTiO3 with comparison to WO3/LaAlO3.76 Water molecules are preferably absorbed on the WO3 surface in an undissociated form as a result of the low-coordinated W ions acting as Lewis acid sites on the surface.77 Many other defect-controllable phenomena via ion intercalation will be introduced in the following section along with the resultant tungsten bronzes.
4. Ion intercalation and tungsten bronzes
An insulator to metal transition could be induced through two main approaches: oxygen deficiency as introduced above, through either surface metallization from loss of surface oxygen, or oxygen migration from the interior to the surface, and ion intercalation as introduced in this section, through the formation of tungsten bronzes.78–80
With ion intercalation, the crystal structure and phase of WO3 will be altered accompanied by the variation of its electronic conductivity, as shown in Fig. 10a.81 As the Li+ ion content increases, WO3 experiences an insulating to metallic state change, while the crystal phase goes through monoclinic, tetragonal, and cubic, sequentially. The Li+ content can be obtained from the chronoamperogram of a WO3 film under different bias voltages (Fig. 10b) with the aid of the following equation:81 (1)where F is the Faraday constant, and nWO3 is the molar amount of WO3.

In situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was employed to investigate the lithiation process of WO3 (Fig. 11).82 It was discovered that Li intercalation into the octahedral cavity of the WO3 lattice resulted in the phase transition of the host with a higher symmetry tendency. WO3 forming LixWO3 was also observed to transform from monoclinic to tetragonal and cubic phases, sequentially. With further intercalation, WO3 was fully reduced and metal state tungsten was produced.

Ion intercalation in hexagonal tungsten oxide hydrate was verified to be more complex than other phases.34 Proton intercalation in hexagonal WO3·0.6H2O started from the insertion of water molecules upon its immersion in the electrolyte at open-circuit voltage and during initial cycling. Subsequently, 0.25 protons per WO3 unit intercalated simultaneously accompanied by the expelling of 0.25 lattice waters. Later, 0.30 protons are inserted. After this stage, 0.17 H3O+ were inserted. The series of different intercalation stages resulted in consecutive anisotropic structural changes. The lattice first contracts along the c-axis but later expanded along the ab plane horizontally.
Ion intercalation leads to the formation of various tungsten bronzes. Superconducting properties were found in tungsten bronzes. The KxWO3 tetragonal tungsten bronze has the highest superconducting transition temperature of 2.1 K at x = 0.38, while the transition temperature decreased as the K content increased (Fig. 12).83 The hexagonal tungsten bronze InxWO3 has a similar pattern with the highest transition temperature at the lowest ion intercalation level, whereas the transition temperature of the cubic tungsten bronze was almost independent of the ion intercalation level.83 The superconducting properties in other tungsten bronzes AxWO3 (A = Rb, Cs) were also studied.84

Many other tungsten bronzes, for instance, the monophosphate tungsten bronze family (PO2)4(WO3)2m, have also been intensively investigated for their various structural and property features.33,85
5. Optoelectronic devices
The tungsten trioxide crystal has a relatively large intrinsic bandgap of around 2.7 eV, which causes its photosensing of almost only UV light and nearly no response to visible light. The relatively wide bandgap makes tungsten trioxide very suitable for visible-blind UV photodetection. Photodetectors based on tungsten oxide are reviewed in this section, and the status and problems in the development of tungsten oxide-based photodetectors are analysed.
A WO3 UV photodetector based on few-layer nanosheets was fabricated via chemical vapour deposition (Fig. 13).86 The photodetector has a 13 μm channel with ultrathin WO3 nanosheets of a 12 nm thickness in between. A fast response of 40 ms, high responsivity of 293 A W−1, ON/OFF ratio of 2000, and EQE of 997% were achieved.

Hai et al. reported for the first time fabrication of monolayer WO3-based UV-A photodetectors at a wafer scale (Fig. 14).24 An ultrafast photoresponse time of less than 40 μs and photoresponsivity of 0.329 A W−1 were achieved. The measured response time surpasses all previous reports for any WO3-based UV photodetector by a factor of 400 (Table 1), and is significantly faster than many other photodetectors based on 2D ultrathin nanomaterials, such as MoS2 (4 s/9 s),87 WS2 (5.3 ms/5.3 ms),88 GaSe (>20 ms/>37 ms),89 and black phosphorus (1 ms/4 ms).90

A UV photodetector assembled from a single polycrystalline WO3 nanobelt exhibited an extremely high responsivity of 2.6 × 105 A W−1 and an external quantum efficiency of 8.1 × 107 % at 405 nm (Fig. 15).25 The photodetector also showed a high ON/OFF ratio up to 1000 with a photocurrent of ca. 12 nA and a very low dark current of 12 pA. The low dark current was attributed to the crystalline grain boundary-trapping photoresponse mechanism in the synthesized polycrystalline WO3 nanobelt, which was different from the typical absorbed oxygen-trapping photoconduction mechanism in single crystalline WO3. In a typical single-crystalline WO3 photoconductor, the photocurrent arises from the detrapped electrons upon illumination, which were trapped by the absorbed oxygen molecules on the surface in the dark (Fig. 15d). This mechanism normally results in a high dark current due to thermal activation. As compared to the typical mechanism, the boundaries of the crystalline grains in polycrystalline WO3 offer a higher energy barrier for carrier transport in the dark, leading to a much lower dark current. Upon UV illumination, the photoexcited holes migrate to the grain boundaries under the internal electric field and lower the barrier height, facilitating electron transport (Fig. 15e).

Nanojunction-interlinked tungsten oxide nanoparticles fabricated via ultrafast thermal annealing were demonstrated for UV detection (Fig. 16).91 The UV photodetector based on the nanojunction-interlinked WO3 nanoparticle networks exhibited a high ON/OFF ratio of 5600 and photoresponsivity of 139 A W−1 upon 360 nm illumination. The nanojunction-interlinked structure with nanoparticle size comparable to the Debye length can take full advantage of the electron-depletion effect with minimized charge recombination, and thus leads to excellent photodetection performance.

A composite structure can also effectively promote the photodetection performance. A WO3 nanosphere/thin-film photodetector based on an interdigitated electrode achieved a highly improved photoresponsivity of 89.2 mA W−1, noise equivalent power of 6.10 × 10−11 W, and detectivity of 5.19 × 109 cm Hz1/2 W−1 compared to the device without WO3 nanospheres (Fig. 17).92

A UV photodetector based on multiple WO3 nanowires was fabricated via oxidation of a radio frequency sputtered 20 nm tungsten film (Fig. 18).93 The gap between the drain and source electrodes is 10 μm and they are connected by multiple nanowires of 500 nm width. The photodetector acts as back-to-back Schottky diodes and the Schottky barrier height was estimated to be 0.45 and 0.55 eV through the modified Richardson–Dushman equation given below:93 (2)where I0, T, A, A*, q, k, and Φ0 are the saturation current, temperature, the effective area of the device, the effective Richardson constant, the elementary charge, the Boltzmann constant, and the barrier height. A fast response time of 112 μs/84 μs was obtained along with a quite high responsivity of 47.3 A W−1. Besides, the photodetector exhibited an extraordinary ON/OFF ratio of over 104 and a 340 nm–450 nm rejection ratio of ca. 8800. In addition, a low noise equivalent power of 0.37 fW Hz−1/2 and a high detectivity of ca. 1012 Jones were also acquired.

Very recently, tungsten oxide heterojunctions have been explored for photodetection applications.94–98 A WO3−x–WSe2/SiO2/n-Si heterojunction photodetector was fabricated via a homo-doping strategy.98 The photodetector exhibited superior near-infrared photoresponsive performance to light of a 900 nm wavelength with a high photoresponsivity of ca. 137.7 A W−1, fast response time of ca. 7.1 ms/5.5 ms, and excellent detectivity of ca. 2.27 × 1014 Jones.
The gas environment has a quite visible impact on the performance of tungsten oxide-based photodetectors. A photodetector based on a W18O49 thin film tested in a vacuum exhibited a two times higher photocurrent than that in air and the photocurrent exceeded by two orders of magnitude that tested in oxygen gas (Fig. 19).99

Based on the reviewing of the publications on tungsten oxide-based photodetectors, the main figures of merit of the reported photodetectors are summarised in Table 1. It is found that the total number of publications is much lower compared to those on other transition metal oxide-based photodetectors. Moreover, the figures of merit were rarely investigated comprehensively, with a large portion of published work only demonstrating the primary UV photosensing property of tungsten oxide. The performance of the photodetectors is far from satisfactory, especially the slow response time of tens of seconds to a few minutes.18,94,95,100–102 Although some figures of merit were achieved at high levels as introduced above, it is still very challenging to fabricate a tungsten oxide photodetector of high performance in all aspects. The development of tungsten oxide-based photodetectors still has a long way to go to compete with the emerging photodetectors based on 2D materials and their heterojunctions.103–109
It can be concluded that the development of tungsten oxide-based photodetectors is still at the early stage. Most research is restricted by the repeatability and reproducibility of the photoresponse processes. This may be attributed to the slow response of tungsten oxide photodetectors and their high sensitivity to the ambient environment, such as temperature, humidity and gas. It is encouraging that tungsten oxide photodetectors are arousing fast-growing interest and more efforts are being put toward the development of higher-performance tungsten oxide photodetectors. Recently, many preliminary attempts from new perspectives have been made, such as doping,95 heterojunctions,96 plasmon resonance,110 and ion-gated transistors.111 Much detailed work, in terms of both challenges, such as fast response and high stability, and opportunities, such as employment of tungsten oxide hydrates and visible light sensing, needs to be carried out to further promote the development of tungsten oxide-based photodetectors.
6. Ionic devices
Compared to the application of photodetectors, tungsten oxides as active materials for electrochromic devices have been through a very long history. Even today, it is still one of the main research topics in the exploration of high-performance electrochromic devices.123 Electrochromic devices are based on ion intercalation/deintercalation, which is very similar to electrical energy storage processes. Therefore, tungsten oxide is also utilized for supercapacitor and battery applications with even more quickly growing interest after the interlayer water molecules were identified to facilitate ion transfer. In this section, the controversial electrochromic mechanisms are introduced first. In the main part, through the selection of recent high-impact work, new fabrication methods, novel configurations, multiple functions, and mechanism investigations of electrochromic and supercapacitive devices are stressed.
Despite the considerable amount of work that has been done on tungsten oxide-based electrochromic devices over the past several decades, the chromogenic mechanism remains controversial.124 Several mechanisms have been proposed such as intervalence charge transfer (IVCT), polaronic absorption, interband excitations, and transitions from the valence band to split off the W5+ state.125 In the improved IVCT model (Fig. 20), V0o (W4+ or 2W5+) defect states are created inside or near the valence band possessing two electrons. V+o (W5+) color centers form once V0o defect states lose one electron in this energy level and are pushed into the bandgap due to the coulombic repulsion of the neighbouring displaced W ions. If two electrons of V0o defect states are delocalized, W6+ states form in the conduction band. The optical transition between V+o (W5+) and V2+o (W6+) contributes to the coloration phenomena.125

The electrochromic phenomena in tungsten oxides were also explained by the optical polaron transition mechanism (Fig. 21), which is similar to the IVCT mechanism. Ion intercalation leads to the reduction of a fraction of W6+ ions into W5+ ions, and the W4+ ions in the tungsten oxides remain unaffected. The optical polaron transitions in W4+/W5+ and W5+/W6+ result in the specific optical absorption spectra (eqn (3) and (4)).126 More and more theoretical investigations for the coloration of tungsten oxides based on density-functional theory are carried out with expectations to reveal the electrochromic mechanism of tungsten oxide.127 hv + W4+i + W5+j → W5+i + W4+j(3) hv′ + W5+i + W6+j → W6+i + W5+j(4)

As for the fabrication of practical electrochromic devices, the performance of tungsten oxide-based devices keeps improving. The electrochromic device based on a WO3·2H2O thin film was compared to a WO3 thin film-based device (Fig. 22).128 The former device exceeded the latter one in both response time and coloration efficiency. The WO3·2H2O-based device showed a faster response time of 3.2 s/1.2 s and higher coloration efficiency of 107.8 cm2 C−1 compared to the WO3-based device with a response time of 10.5 s/7.4 s and coloration efficiency of 46.6 cm2 C−1 (Fig. 22e and f).

A flexible electrochromic device was demonstrated on WO3·2H2O ultrathin nanosheets with ITO/PET as a transparent and conductive flexible substrate (Fig. 23).129,130 The device achieved high optical transmittance modulation of 41.7% at 700 nm and a faster switching speed of 9.7 s/5.1 s, which is significantly improved over the device based on the bulk powder. The coloration efficiency (120.9 cm2 C−1) of the WO3·2H2O ultrathin nanosheet-based device is also superior to that (38.5 cm2 C−1) of the bulk powder-based device. The high performance was attributed to the wider intercalation channels and shorter intercalation paths of the exfoliated WO3·2H2O ultrathin nanosheets.

Few-layered WO3 nanosheets converted from layered WS2 were also adopted to enhance the electrochromic performance.131 Besides, tungsten oxide was composited with other materials such as TiO2 to enhance the electrochromic performance.132 In addition to the electrochromic material itself, ionic intercalants with bi- and tri-positive charges were also explored toward higher-performance electrochromic devices.133–135 The electrochromic behaviours of tungsten oxide intercalated with H+, Na+, and Al3+ in both aqueous and nonaqueous electrolytes were investigated.135 The investigation revealed that the electrochromic device using trivalent Al3+ as intercalation ions exhibited faster switching, higher contrast and more stable behaviours (Tables 2 and 3).

Hybrid density-functional theory calculations offer a theoretical view for the investigation of tungsten oxide electrochromic phenomena with alkali metal ion intercalation. The visible light transmittance of h-WO3 was simulated to improve by 10% on average after ion intercalation, while the infrared transmittance decreased dramatically down to ca. 28% (Fig. 24).136 This can be an effective approach for indoor temperature adjustment.

The independent modulation of visible and near-infrared (NIR) light was achieved via electrochromic devices based on m-WO3−x ultra-small nanowires (ca. 30 nm in length and ca. 2.5 nm in diameter).137 The NIR transmittance was controlled by LSPR within a voltage range of 4–2.8 V, whereas visible light maintained very high transmittance (Fig. 25). The NIR transmittance could be further modulated via the co-contribution of LSPR and insulator-to-metal transition effects in a voltage range of 2.8–2.6 V accompanied by visible light modulation. Visible light was dramatically tuned via bandgap transitions in a voltage range of 2.6–2 V. Therefore, the device realized bright, cool and dark modes via the independent modulation of the visible and the NIR section in the sunlight spectrum.

A novel electrochromic device was demonstrated for a writing board application.138 The specific hydrogel-containing pen can write arbitrarily on the tungsten oxide-based board (Fig. 26). The handwriting can be well maintained without additional power due to the optical memory effect of the tungsten oxide thin film (Fig. 26b). The content on the board can be erased with a reverse bias voltage (Fig. 26c), making it very appealing for rewritable electrochromic displays.

Three-terminal electrochromic devices were also invented with the electrode near the active electrochromic material divided into two electrodes (drain and source electrodes) and configured for different application purposes (Fig. 27).139 With the gate voltage controlling the transparency of the electrochromic device, the accompanying insulating-to-metallic transition modulated the electronic property, which offers great potential to achieve multiple functions in one device.

Electrochromic devices generally suffer from performance degradation after certain cycles of operation. The degradation mechanism was proposed to be ion trapping, and the device can be rejuvenated by applying a weak constant current for hours, which is called the galvanostatic rejuvenation technique.19,140–144 The current was chosen as of the order of the peak value observed under potentiostatic detrapping and applied in the opposite direction to that in the coloration process.141 The performance of electrochromic devices can be almost fully restored after galvanostatic treatment (Fig. 28a).144 Time-of-flight elastic recoil detection analysis demonstrated that the trapped Li+ ions, which were responsible for the degradation of the electrochromic properties, were nearly completely freed (Fig. 28b). The open-circuit potential (OCP) measurement after rejuvenation was observed to be identical to the initial OCP (Fig. 28c).

With the high similarity of its working mechanism, tungsten oxide was also employed for supercapacitor applications due to its low cost, abundant ion channel structures, and multiple oxidation states.145–150 However, its poor conductivity renders unsatisfying electrochemical performance. Reduced graphene oxide was composited with hexagonal WO3 nanorods to improve its electric conductivity.27 The nanocomposites achieved a higher specific capacitance of 343 F g−1 at 0.2 A g−1 compared to that of the pure WO3 nanorods of 200 F g−1 at 0.2 A g−1.151 Ni doping into tungsten oxide with a concentration of 4.21 at% exhibited an ultrahigh specific capacitance of 557 F g−1 at 1 A g−1. Calculations based on density functional theory confirmed the increased free electron concentration for fast charge transport and electronic structure modulation of tungsten oxide upon Ni doping.
To solve sluggish ion diffusion and penetration restrictions in crystalline tungsten trioxide, low-crystallinity tungsten trioxide was synthesized as a supercapacitor electrode.152 The results showed that the low-crystallinity tungsten trioxide offered higher specific capacitance than the high-crystallinity counterpart (474 F g−1vs. 348 F g−1 at 0.1 A g−1). The capacitive capacitance dominated the charge storage in low-crystallinity tungsten trioxide, while it contributed little to the high-crystallinity one due to the plentiful structural disorder and defects formed in the low-crystallinity tungsten trioxide (Fig. 29).

Hierarchical nanostructured h-WO3·nH2O consisting of nanorods was synthesized with mixed ionic-electronic conductivity for electrochemical energy storage.153 Single-file water chains embedded within the channels facilitated fast electrochemical kinetics (Fig. 30a). The supercapacitor based on such a hierarchical h-WO3·nH2O electrode yielded the highest capacitance of 498 F g−1 at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 (Fig. 30b), which is close to the theoretical capacitance calculated based on a one-electron transfer mechanism within a voltage window of 0.8 V. The electrode also exhibited a very long cycling life of over 50000 cycles without capacitance decay (Fig. 30c).153

The structural water in tungsten oxides was recently reported to be responsible for the energy storage mechanism transition from solid-state diffusion to intercalation pseudocapacitance.35,153,154 Compared to anhydrous tungsten oxide, hydrous tungsten oxide was proved via the operando AFM dilatometry technique to exhibit smaller and more gradual mechanical deformation with no hysteresis and fast charge transfer kinetics during the intercalation/deintercalation processes (Fig. 31).155

However, compared to bulk tungsten oxide film, the charge storage mechanism for 100 nm-thick tungsten oxide film was also proved to be mainly capacitive, of which pseudocapacitance was dominant (Fig. 32a).156 As the thickness increases, the diffusion-controlled process became dominant. The 100 nm-thick tungsten oxide film exhibited the highest charge capacity of 242.1 C g−1 (403.5 F g−1) (Fig. 32b). With the voltage gradually shifted to negative, the colour of the samples changed from light blue to dark blue.

Such hybrid devices joining electrochromic devices and supercapacitors are called electrochromic supercapacitors. This research direction also attracts considerable attention due to the visible colour-indicative electrical capacity. The electrochromic supercapacitor based on a cellulose-nanofiber/Ag-nanowire/reduced-graphene-oxide/WO3-composite electrode exhibited the maximum coloration efficiency of 64.8 cm2 C−1 and specific capacitance of 406.0 F g−1. The device retained 75.0% and 94.1% of its coloration efficiency and electrochemical capacitance over 10000 cycles. The electrochromic device was also integrated with a solar sensor to enable a photosensing function and smarter operation.28
To summarize, the development of ionic devices based on tungsten oxides is at quite a high level. Nevertheless, compared to the performance of ionic devices based on other materials (for instance, Co3O4, V2O5 and MnO2 for supercapacitors,157 and fast-growing organic electrochromic materials158), tungsten oxide-based ionic devices lack very strong competitiveness. To break the development bottleneck, the following aspects need to be considered: (1) the water content in tungsten oxide hydrates and multivalent ions can be further explored to improve tungsten oxide-based ionic devices. (2) In order to meet the trend of flexible devices, tungsten oxide films are required to be very thin and may consist of ultrathin tungsten oxide nanosheets or quantum dots, the large-scale synthesis methods of which need to be perfected. (3) On the request for the device miniaturization, the sandwich structure for applications such as supercapacitor and electrochromic devices hinders their integration into portable, flexible and microelectronic devices. A configuration change for supercapacitor and electrochromic devices based on tungsten oxide is highly demanded. (4) The various properties of tungsten oxide enable its multiple functions. Bifunctional electrochromic supercapacitors are intensively investigated. Nevertheless, its photoelectric, gas sensing, insulating-to-metallic transition, catalysis, and other properties have not been merged into ionic devices to reach synergistic effects and to achieve smarter applications. There are still plenty of opportunities for exploration in this direction.
7. Iontronic devices
Since the concept of iontronics was proposed, tungsten oxide has found a new platform to exhibit its versatilities. It has been applied to memristors and electrolyte-gated transistors, which are reviewed in this section.
Flexible resistive random access memory (RRAM) devices were fabricated based on WO3−x nanoparticles (NP) prepared via anodic treatment on a 40 nm W thin film (Fig. 33).32 The Cu/WO3−x NP/ITO configuration exhibited a bipolar switching characteristic with an ON/OFF ratio of ca. 105, a retention time of more than 5 × 105 s, and bending endurance over 103 cycles. The working mechanism was proposed to be reversible Cu oxidation/reduction and Cu ion migration under bias voltage control, which leads to the formation/annihilation of conductive filaments and thus causes high/low-resistance states (HRS/LRS) (Fig. 33d).

Ultrathin WO3·2H2O nanosheets with only 2–3 nm thickness were constructed for a high-performance and flexible RRAM device with a Cu/WO3·H2O/ITO configuration (Fig. 34). The abundant vacancy associates revealed by positron annihilation spectra in the ultrathin nanosheets promote Cu2+ trapping, leading to the formation of conductive filaments. The device exhibited remarkable memory performance: an operating voltage of +1.0 V/−1.14 V, ON/OFF ratio of >105, retention time of >105 s, and endurance of >5000 cycles.159

The conductive filament working mechanism of tungsten oxide-based memory devices was proved on the device configuration of ITO/WO3/ITO with a cathodically electrodeposited 50 nm WO3 thin film (Fig. 35).21 Bipolar switching behaviour based on the redox reaction of defects was directly observed in the cross-sectional TEM images (Fig. 35b and c). The W ions with low oxidation state, shown as big black dots in the TEM image, dramatically increased and expended upon the set voltage while these states almost disappeared near the negative electrode upon the reset voltage. This evidence combined with XPS and energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) results further demonstrated that the oxygen ion migration upon the bias voltage led to the formation/annihilation of tungsten-rich conductive filaments as illustrated in Fig. 35d. A similar mechanism was also proved in the Pt/WO3/Pt configuration.160

Different electrode materials could result in different working mechanisms for memristors due to their chemical activities and work functions.161–163 A W/W18O49/Au configuration was fabricated to work based on the Schottky barrier height (SBH) change induced by the redox reaction occurring at the W/W18O49 interface (Fig. 36).164 An additional superhydrophobic property was also achieved as a result of the nanowire array structure of W18O49 (Fig. 36b). The SBH change mechanism was indicated in the ln(I)–V1/2 plot redrawn from the I–V characteristics of the devices (Fig. 36c and d), where the LRS and HRS parts of the curve were linear with the intercept difference interpreted to be the SBH difference. The interpretation is based on Richardson's law:164 (5)where J, A, k, T, ϕs, and Δϕs are the current density, Richardson coefficient, Boltzmann constant, temperature, Schottky barrier, and barrier lowering for Schottky emission. The variable Δϕs is directly related to the applied electric field: (6)where e, E, ε0, ε, and βs are the charge of an electron, applied electric field, permittivity of free space, relative dielectric constant, and the Schottky coefficient. Therefore, (7)

Since the Schottky coefficient, temperature, Richardson coefficient and Boltzmann constant and the device dimensions are constant, the variation of the Schottky barrier height is the only factor that affects the intercept of the ln(J) − E½ linear plot, i.e., the ln(I)–V1/2 linear plot. Therefore, the intercept difference between the LRS and HRS parts of the ln(I)–V1/2 plot indicates the SBH difference. The SBH difference was induced by the redox reaction of the W electrode at the W/W18O49 interfaces (Fig. 36e). The oxygen ions in W18O49 migrate to the interfaces to oxidize the W electrode into WOx under a negative bias voltage, lowering the SBH and resulting in the LRS. Upon a positive bias voltage, the oxygen ions migrate back to the Au/W18O49 interfaces by reduction of the WOx layer at the W/W18O49 interfaces, thus recovering the SBH and resistance to the original higher levels. The rougher W/W18O49 interface from the HRTEM images after several times of resistive switching further suggested the resistive switching mechanism (Fig. 36f and g).
The performance and operating mechanisms of memristors are not only determined by the electrode materials, but are also prominently affected by the surrounding atmosphere such as air, vacuum, oxygen gas, or inert gas environments.165
An inappropriately large operation voltage could lead to the failure of the bipolar resistive switching memory device. A revival method for tungsten oxide-based memristive devices was developed and demonstrated on the Pt/WO3−x/Pt configuration.166 The device failure was proposed to be the formation of ordered vacancy structure upon a large voltage pulse, resulting in a permanent low-resistance state. Precisely controlled voltage sweeping at a certain compliance current could generate a Joule heating effect and disrupt the ordered vacancy structure, thus reviving the device. This revival method is similar to those applied for the rejuvenation of tungsten oxide-based electrochromic devices degraded due to trapped ions as mentioned in the previous section.
Electrochromic and resistive switching functions were united in one device with an electrochromic structure of FTO/WOx/electrolyte/ITO and a resistance random access memory structure of Al/WOx/FTO via patterning Al electrodes on WOx (Fig. 37).167 The multifunctional devices realized multiple transmittance states and bipolar nonvolatile resistive switching (Fig. 37c and d).

Besides memristors, the concept of iontronics also extends to electrolyte-gated transistors. An ionic liquid (IL)-gated transistor based on mesoporous nanostructured WO3 thin film channels was studied.168 The transistors using a bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide ([TFSI])-based ionic liquid can operate at voltages as low as 1.0 V and obtained a charge carrier density larger than 1014 cm−2. The gating was found not only to induce electrostatic effects but also to intercalate protons from water traces.
The IL gate-induced volume metallization of WO3 was proved for all its facets compared to rutile VO2, which is only possible for its facets with open channels.78 It's found that the volume metallization was accompanied by the reversible expansion/contraction of the lattice even for very thick films of 90 nm.
A vertical electrolyte-gated WO3 transistor with interdigital structure was reported.169 The electrolyte was composed of 75 wt% of acrylic resin, 22.75 wt% of succinonitrile, and 2.25 wt% of lithium perchlorate. The transistor was identified to be able to work in three modes of insulating, field-effect, and electrochemically intercalating, due to the electrolyte-gating (Fig. 38a and b). The interdigital electrodes enabled a large amount of charge flow paths, making the operation less sensitive to the WO3 thickness and smoothing the working mode transition (Fig. 38c). The device showed an On/Off ratio of 5 × 106 and a transconductance of 3.59 mS (Fig. 38d).

Different gating effects with different electrolytes were investigated in planar electrolyte-gated WO3 transistors (Fig. 39).170 The IL-gated device worked depending on electrostatic accumulation/depletion, while the salt/polymer-gated device operated through electrochemical intercalation/deintercalation. Although the insulator-to-metal transition was observed for both devices upon certain gate voltages, the electrostatic working mechanism did not require the voltage to recover to the initial state. And X-ray diffraction revealed that the electrostatic mechanism only charged the crystal phase near the interface, whereas the intercalation mechanism induced continuous phase change in the crystal. Based on this principle, the configuration was employed for the emulation of synapses.22

In summary, the research on tungsten oxide iontronic devices is currently focusing on the fundamental mechanisms and basic performance. The IL-gated WO3 transistor, which is found to mainly work through electrostatic accumulation and depletion, is analogous to classic field effect transistors.171 However, most of the iontronic devices based on tungsten oxide operate through the ion migration mechanism. The concept of iontronics offers a fresh-new perspective for tungsten oxide devices. Tungsten oxide has been proved to be very sensitive to defects. Traditionally, the defect profiles in tungsten oxide and other semiconductor-based electronic devices are usually treated as “static” states, which are intentionally introduced via doping or other processes. Moreover, the functionalities of the semiconductor devices are traditionally modulated by an alterable electric field, magnetic field, and stress (Fig. 40a).172 The diffusion of defects, primarily oxygen vacancies in oxide semiconductors or other ions (doped or naturally occurring), is always overlooked due to the relatively large semiconductor size, or seen as a detriment if the rate of diffusion is over the threshold. However, as electronic devices enter into the nanoscale level, the diffusion length of the defects under routine controlling and environment parameters such as electric fields, magnetic fields, and temperature, is comparable to the device scale. The variation of defects could, therefore, induce new functionalities such as emerging resistive switching in memristors. The defect profile, captured with the chemical potential as the dynamic variable, could lead to the discovery of more novel phenomena and functionalities via interacting with electric fields, stress and other physical variables (Fig. 40b).172 Along with this opportunity, techniques for dynamically and atomically manipulating the concentration and profile of vacancies and ions in oxide semiconductors are highly demanded. How to multi-functionalize iontronic devices and introduce new physical stimuli into the system are new directions worthy to explore. Furthermore, the stability of new devices in ambient air also needs to be carefully evaluated.

8. Conclusion and outlook
In this review, the diversity of tungsten oxide in terms of structure, morphology, defects, and ion intercalation is introduced first with an emphasis on their correlation with electronic structures. Tungsten oxide thin film devices from optoelectronics and ionics to iontronics are reviewed, highlighting the recent progress in photodetectors, electrochromic and supercapacitive devices, memristors and electrolyte-gated transistors. The development status, trends, challenges, and opportunities are summarised, analysed, and proposed. It is clear that tungsten oxide's scale, water content and defects are of great importance for its electronic and electrochemical properties. The research on different types of tungsten oxide thin film devices is at different levels. The development of tungsten oxide optoelectronic devices is still at an early stage, the investigation of ionic devices meets a bottleneck, and the work on emerging iontronic devices is thriving.
Considering the challenges and opportunities based on the development of tungsten oxide thin film devices, the following aspects are worthy to be further explored:
(1) Defect profile and water content. More microscopic and other investigation approaches are required to establish quantitative relations between the defect (oxygen vacancies and ion intercalation) profile and electronic behaviours in tungsten oxide nanofilms. Besides, the effects of the water content in tungsten oxide nanofilms on the defect migration and electron mobility are also unclear. Moreover, the introduction of other stimuli, such as external magnetic fields and forces, to manipulate the defect profile in tungsten oxide nanofilms could be intriguing.
(2) Electrolyte. The performance of many tungsten oxide devices is highly electrolyte-dependent. Developing higher quality and effective electrolytes is one possible solution, such as adoption of multivalent ions. Replacing the normal electrolyte with new forms of ion reservoirs may be also possible. However, little effort has been made in this respect.
(3) Scale. Ionic devices are commonly fabricated at the eye-visible scale. If the active materials and devices scale down to eye-invisible size, tungsten oxide may exceed other materials in performance and new phenomena may be disclosed. Considering that few-layered tungsten oxides and quantum dots have not been intensively investigated, it poses great opportunities for nanoscale research.
(4) Configuration. Since the invention of electrochromic devices, the configuration of the devices has not been apparently changed as well as the supercapacitor configuration. Innovation in terms of the configuration could lead to fresh-new devices with new functionalities.
(5) Multiple functions. Tungsten oxide possesses various properties even within a single tungsten oxide piece with no more extra modifications. The multiple properties existing simultaneously, however, are normally intentionally overlooked or eliminated to acquire a single stable signal as wished. For example, one two-terminal device based on a piece of tungsten oxide could respond to light, temperature, humidity, gas, solutions and other physical and chemical stimuli at the same time. Further integration of tungsten oxide with other materials such as heterostructures based on WO3/2D layered materials may yield more functionalities. With exquisite design and multiple controls, high-performance multifunctional (not limited to two functions) devices based on tungsten oxides could be achieved.
