1 Introduction
With global warming posing a major threat to human society, “carbon neutrality” has become a global consensus in energy strategies.1–3 Searching for effective CO2 conversion methods is of great importance to alleviate global warming and energy crisis. Photocatalysis and electrocatalysis are popular technologies that can directly convert CO2 into value-added chemicals and fuels at room temperature. The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) can be driven by renewable energy sources with appropriate catalysts and electrolytes in electrochemical cells.4–9 The photocatalytic CO2RR combines solar energy utilization and CO2 conversion, and is expected to be a potential technology to achieve this challenging goal.10–12 Photocatalytic CO2RR research has made great progress in recent decades.13–16 In 1970s, photocatalytic CO2 reduction was successfully realized by some semiconductors.17,18 Since then, this research field has attracted great attention. Some Ag-loaded metal oxide semiconductors (BaLa4Ti4O15, Ga2O3, etc.) could even exhibit the ability to reduce CO2 to CO in pure water systems.19,20 In order to increase the catalytic efficiency and solar light utilization of the photocatalytic CO2RR, visible-light-active photocatalytic systems with sacrificial agents are frequently studied. Ishitani et al. have designed a series of efficient photocatalytic CO2 reduction systems based on metal complexes in organic sacrificial agent systems.21–26 Considering that organic sacrificial agents are expensive and likely to interfere with product identification, we focused on photocatalytic reduction in inorganic aqueous medium in this review.
Developing efficient photocatalytic CO2 reduction systems is the key for the solar CO2 conversion into various types of high value-added chemicals such as carbon monoxide and formic acid.27–30 However, the design of photocatalytic CO2RR systems also faces the following significant challenges.
(i) High thermodynamic requirements
Although multiple e−-H+ CO2 reduction reactions have less negative standard electrode potentials, the product formation via these reactions is actually difficult due to the unfavorable kinetics. Studies that could provide conclusive isotope results generally give 2e− CO2RR products (i.e., CO and HCOOH). Since the standard electrode potential for CO2 reduction via a 2e− reaction (ca. −0.11 vs. standard hydrogen electrode) is more negative than that of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), a negative conduction band is thermodynamically favorable for photocatalytic CO2 reduction in most cases.
(ii) Competitive HER
Photocatalytic CO2 systems with high activity and selectivity are very limited so far. As observed in electrocatalytic systems, the HER is very competitive to the CO2RR, especially in inorganic aqueous reaction systems.31 Therefore, CO2RR photocatalysts should have effective cocatalysts to improve CO2 activation and suppress the competitive HER.
(iii) Uneconomical reaction medium
In order to achieve considerable CO2 photoreduction rates under visible light, an efficient strategy is to couple the semiconductors having negative conduction bands (such as TaON and C3N4) with functional organic complexes as cocatalysts.24,32 Although the efficiency of the CO2RR can be obviously improved, it generally needs to be operated in organic reaction media (such as acetonitrile or alcohol) and/or organic sacrificial agents (such as triethanolamine or alcohol). These high-price organic sacrificial agents make the overall CO2RR very uneconomical. Moreover, organic carbon will seriously interfere with the identification of CO2 reduction products and the carbon source must be verified by isotope experiments to eliminate the interference of the contaminative carbon source with the reaction products. What is worse, the functional organic complexes tend to be deactivated due to self-photo corrosion or photooxidation by adjacent semiconductor photocatalysts, leading to poor durability of their long-term reactions. Therefore, it should be more advantageous to select an inorganic electron donor and aqueous reaction medium, which is also in line with the original intention of artificial photosynthesis.
(iv) Other challenges
It is well known that the wide gap and poor photogenerated electron–hole separation efficiency result in low solar energy utilization efficiency. Therefore, the photocatalyst should have acceptable light absorption and should be able to achieve efficient CO2 conversion under mild light such as visible light or simulated sunlight. Moreover, it would be very favorable if a photocatalyst with simple preparation and low cost could be designed.
ZnS is an outstanding photocatalyst and has experienced rapid development in recent years. Impressive performance has been achieved through the flexible design of ZnS-based photocatalytic systems in the aspect of energy band engineering, cocatalyst loading and reaction medium optimization. In this work, we will review the design strategies of efficient ZnS-based photocatalytic systems, including modulation of reaction media, continuous functionalization of ZnS nanocrystal photocatalysts and construction of Z-scheme reaction systems. These strategies can be widely used in the construction of other photocatalytic CO2RR systems with improved activity and selectivity.
2 Why is ZnS so efficient for photocatalytic CO2 reduction?
ZnS is known to function as an efficient UV-driven hydrogen evolution photocatalyst. It mainly has two polymorphs, named zinc blende and wurtzite. However, among most of the photocatalysts, ZnS shows a relatively more negative conduction band which renders it very reductive in the photocatalytic reaction (Fig. 1a and b).33,34 Compared with oxides and some promising sulfide photocatalysts (e.g., CdS35,36 and CuGaS237), it is easy to be prepared, non-toxic and cheap.33,38–40 Moreover, compared with phosphide and selenide photocatalysts, it also has better photostability. These properties make it an excellent material for the photocatalytic CO2RR. For example, ZnS-based nanocrystal photocatalysts simply prepared through rapid co-precipitation could exhibit high photocatalytic activity.38,39 The ZnS nanocrystal prepared by this method displays a cubic zinc blende structure, and the high-density defects on its surface serving as active sites are favorable for the photocatalytic reaction to proceed. The surface activity and band gap of ZnS can be flexibly modulated by means of active site construction or doping to improve the overall photocatalytic performance.11,38,40–43

3 The electron donor and reaction medium used in photocatalytic CO2 reduction
The sacrificial agents often used in photocatalytic CO2 reduction include methanol,24,44 triethanolamine (TEOA),32 dimethylcarbinol,45 Na2S,46etc. Using high-cost organic sacrificial agents is uneconomical and they will also seriously interfere with CO2 reduction product identification. For an inorganic electron donor, SO32− is economical and accessible. It is superior to the toxic and pungent Na2S and can be used for efficient CO2 reduction over ZnS-based nanocrystal photocatalysts in an inorganic aqueous medium under visible light (Fig. 2).38 Using SO32− for photocatalytic CO2 reduction is also very meaningful since it can remove CO2 (greenhouse gas) and SO2 (acid-rain-formation gas) at the same time, and CO2 will be reduced to CO and HCOOH, and SO2 will eventually be converted into the environment-friendly product SO42−. The aqueous solution containing SO32− is thus a useful model reaction medium for ZnS-based photocatalytic CO2RR systems.

The aim of reaction medium modulation is to increase the concentration of active species as much as possible. Generally, the active species for CO2 reduction in an aqueous phase are considered to be H2CO3 and HCO3−.47,48 The concentration distribution of carbon-containing species at different pH values (Fig. 3a) clearly shows that lowering the pH and/or increasing the concentration of HCO3− can directly boost the total concentration of the active species H2CO3 or HCO3−.47 The introduction of CO2 into the K2SO3 reaction solution significantly neutralized the pH of the reaction solution and increased the total concentration of the active species.38 CO2 saturation benefits the CO2 reduction selectivity and restrains the selectivity of the HER (Fig. 3c and d). Further addition of KHCO3 with a good buffering effect suppressed the pH change of the reaction solution and modulated it to be nearly neutral (Fig. 3b). Therefore, when we regulate the reaction medium by adding HCO3− and bubbling CO2 into the reaction solution at the same time, the concentration of the reactive species as well as the photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity and selectivity could thus be maximized. With the concentration of KHCO3 increasing, the yield rates of syngas (a CO and H2 mixture in the gas phase) and HCOOH monotonically increased (Fig. 3e, f and g).38

4 Design of efficient ZnS-based photocatalytic systems
4.1 Active site construction for CO2 photoreduction
The photocatalytic efficiency and stability can be improved by constructing active sites on ZnS nanocrystal surfaces.49 The aim of active site construction is to adjust the electronic structure to promote the activation of CO2 molecules.50 We have employed two different ways of active site construction, including cocatalyst loading and vacancy creation by surface etching.39–41 The creation of these active sites enhanced the CO2 photoreduction rate in the abovementioned all-inorganic reaction medium. The preparation schematic of ZnS-based photocatalysts is shown in Fig. 4 below. These ZnS-based materials consist of nanocrystals prepared via a co-precipitation method with low crystallinity and commercial ZnS bulk particles with high crystallinity.

4.1.1 Cocatalyst loading. 
Photocatalytic CO2 conversion depends on three key factors: (i) photon capture, (ii) photogenerated carrier (electron and hole) separation and transfer, and (iii) activation of CO2 on the surface. Due to the recombination of photoexcited carriers and the relatively inert surface properties of semiconductors, the photocatalytic performance of bare semiconductors is limited. Cocatalysts play positive roles in improving the performance of photocatalysts. Since the mechanism of semiconductor photocatalysis is similar to electrochemical processes (the semiconductor functions as the anode of an electrochemical system and the nanocatalyst as the cathode), catalysts with good electrocatalytic CO2RR properties are also suitable for use as cocatalysts in principle.51 Readers can refer to some recent reviews for more details on the design of cocatalysts toward the photocatalytic CO2RR.51–53
Considering that Fe2+, Co2+, and Ni2+ sulfides generally exhibit excellent HER activity, loading these ionic cocatalysts will probably suppress the CO2 reduction selectivity.54 A screening study on the performance of various cocatalysts (Pd, Pt, Ag, Au, Cd, Al, Ga, In and Sn) on ZnS nanocrystals for photocatalytic CO2 reduction showed that non-precious Cd2+ ion modification could remarkably enhance the activity, while the noble metal cocatalysts did not improve the photocatalytic performance.38 The selectivity of Cd/ZnS nanocrystals for CO2 reduction to HCOOH reached 95% and the apparent quantum efficiency for HCOOH formation at 280 nm reached 76%. The turnover number of HCOOH was 434 in an 8-hour reaction with respect to the number of Cd2+ ions. Isotope tracing experiments with 13CO2 showed that CO2 provided a 100% carbon source of CO and HCOOH in the photocatalytic reaction.38
The calculation of the charge density distribution on the Cd2+ modified (111) and (110) planes of ZnS (Fig. 5a–d) revealed the fundamental mechanism of the superior CO2 reduction rate. In this calculation model, Cd2+ substitutes surface Zn2+ of ZnS.39 A higher charge density at the Cd2+ site could be obviously identified, resulting from the spontaneous electron transfer from ZnS to Cd2+. Next, the projected density of states (PDOS) of the s, p and d orbitals for Zn2+ and Cd2+ at the ZnS surface were compared (Fig. 5e–j). The PDOS of the s orbitals for Zn and Cd (Fig. 5e and h) at both crystal surfaces are closer to the Fermi energy (EF) than those of the other orbitals (Fig. 5f, g, i and j). The Cd s orbital has higher PDOS near the band-edge and a relatively lower lying band center compared to the Zn s orbital (Fig. 5e and h). Thus, the electrons will preferentially populate the lower energy Cd s orbital, which is consistent with the results of charge density distribution. It could be speculated that the outermost s orbital of the Cd atom interacted with the electrophilic C atom of the CO2 molecule and initiated the photocatalytic CO2RR.39

4.1.2 Vacancy creation via acid etching. 
Inspired by the high performance of small-size and high-surface-defect-density ZnS nanocrystals prepared by rapid co-precipitation, an acid etching method was developed to activate the commercial bulk high-crystallinity ZnS particles.41 The etching treatment successfully created cationic vacancy (VZn) defects as CO2RR active sites on the ZnS surface, which enhanced the charge separation and facilitated the photocatalytic CO2 reduction with high HCOOH selectivity (>85%) in inorganic aqueous solutions in the absence of co-catalysts. The free energy of the reaction intermediates was calculated to elucidate the effect of surface VZn on CO2RR kinetics (Fig. 6a). The free energy of H adsorption on VZn-ZnS is more negative than that on pristine ZnS (Fig. 6), demonstrating that the VZn-containing surface is unfavorable for the HER compared to the pristine surface. The CO2RR over both kinds of ZnS surfaces to HCOOH showed a decreasing free energy (Fig. 6c) and the lower surface free energy on VZn-ZnS indicates that the CO2RR is more active on etching ZnS than pristine commercial ZnS. The key to efficient CO2 reduction to HCOOH on ZnS is the formation of COO−* intermediates. Compared with the defect-free surface, VZn helps stabilize the critical single electron CO2 reduction intermediate COO−* with a lower formation barrier, thus accelerating the overall catalytic reduction rate. These results indicated that VZn-ZnS is energetically favorable for active and selective CO2 photo-reduction. The acid treatment makes the well-crystallized ZnS active for CO2 photo-reduction with high HCOOH selectivity.

The acid treatment was also applied to ZnxCd1−xS solid solution nanocrystals, which induced phase transformation and the formation of abundant sulfur vacancies (VS) to facilitate the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to CO and H+ to H2.55 Zn0.5Cd0.5S has a cubic zinc blende configuration. After acid etching, the crystal is restructured and the sulfur atoms escape from the grain surface (probably in the form of H2S). Under these conditions, the phase of Zn0.5Cd0.5S will be partly transformed from sphalerite to wurtzite (Fig. 7a). A large amount of VS facilitates the adsorption and activation of CO2 and H2O molecules to promote the formation of CO and H2 in the photocatalytic reaction. The density of state (DOS) profile indicated that VS in VS-Zn0.5Cd0.5S increases the electron density near the conduction band (the peaks in the red box) and promotes CO2 reduction (Fig. 7b). The DFT calculations showed more negative ΔG values of VS-Zn0.5Cd0.5S for the overall CO2 adsorption and CO2 reduction process (Fig. 7c). As a simple surface treatment strategy, the acid treatment of ZnS-based photocatalysts provides a new way for the active site construction and might be applicable to other sulfide photocatalysts.

4.2 Visible-light-sensitized ZnS for CO2 photoreduction

4.2.1 Single photocatalytic system. 
An obvious drawback of ZnS nanocrystals is the wide band gap.33 Based on the abovementioned studies, Cd/ZnS:Cu and Cd/ZnS:Ni photocatalysts were designed for solar light powered CO2 reduction.39,40 To improve the utilization of solar light, Kudo et al. have reported a series of doping strategies which successfully sensitized ZnS with visible light photoabsorption and brought forth excellent photocatalytic hydrogen production activity.42,43,56 Cu (or Ni) doping adjusted the band structure while Cd2+ loading enhanced the surface reactivity (Scheme 1).39 In ZnS:Cu, an electron donor level above the ZnS valence band was created by a Cu+ 3d orbital. This narrowed the band gap and allowed the material to be excited by visible light. As the Cu doping concentration increases, the material exhibits better photoabsorption in the visible light region (Fig. 8a and b), which makes it achieve more efficient photocatalysis under mild light irradiation.

The optimal doping amount of Cu was 0.2–0.5% to achieve the highest yields of both syngas and HCOOH (Fig. 8c, d and e). DFT calculations showed that the replacement of Zn by Cu atoms in ZnS could decrease the VS formation energy.39 Therefore, after Cu doping, S vacancies will be formed on the surface and bulk phase of ZnS nanocrystals. Excessive Cu doping might lead to a large amount of VS inside ZnS particles and lead to more charge recombination. For ZnS, empirically the activation of both the HER and CO2RR for CO production is associated with the surface VS. The ZnS nanocrystals prepared by a rapid coprecipitation method have a rich active surface structure. The ZnS:Cu nanocrystals inherit such a surface structure and retain a large number of VS for a high syngas yield. In addition, Cd cocatalyst loading will significantly increase CO2 reduction activity by suppressing the transfer of photo-excited carriers to VS, with the quenched fluorescence emission being observed at 380–500 nm (Fig. 8f). The simultaneous functionalization by Cu doping and Cd cocatalyst loading optimized the performance of the photocatalyst which exhibited high CO2RR activity and 99% HCOOH selectivity (Fig. 8g, h and i). The CO2 reduction performance of Cd/ZnS:Cu was much better than that of the Cu and Cd co-doped ZnS photocatalyst, indicating that Cd2+ was preferentially used as the co-catalyst instead of a dopant for ZnS. As an efficient CO2RR photocatalyst, Cd/ZnS:Cu has many advantages.39 It is probably one of the most active and optimally designed sulfide photocatalysts for solar light driven CO2 reduction, which contains no precious metals and can be rapidly synthesized at room temperature. It is also a photocatalyst that can be operated in an all-inorganic aqueous medium free of the S2− sacrificial agent. This is thus very favorable to the gas product identification procedure without poisoning the Ni catalyst embedded in the methanizer of gas chromatograph. Therefore, Cd/ZnS:Cu or ZnS:Cu could be used as a model photocatalyst for CO2 reduction studies.
Ni-doped ZnS nanocrystals (ZnS:Ni) prepared by the same co-precipitation method were also effective for CO2 reduction to HCOOH.40 The Ni doping introduced an occupied state above the valence band of ZnS. Similar to Cd/ZnS:Cu, the Cd/ZnS:Ni nanocrystals for HCOOH production reached 138 μmol h−1 under 1 sun with about 99% selectivity.40 The optimal Ni doping was about 0.1% (Fig. 9a–c). ZnS:Ni with Cd2+ surface modification achieved more than 95% HCOOH selectivity, with apparent quantum yields of 59.1% and 5.6%, respectively, at 340 nm and 420 nm for CO2 reduction to HCOOH (Fig. 9d). Electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy showed a sharp signal at g1 = 1.999 ± 0.004 and a broad signal located at g2 = 2.007 ± 0.004 for both undoped and Ni doped ZnS nanocrystals (Fig. 9e).40 The sharp signal strongly supported the presence of VS with paramagnetic electrons. ZnS with a low Ni doping amount (<0.2%) has a higher number of surface active sites according to the larger intensity of the chemisorbed oxygen signal. However, the doping amount above 0.2% reduced VS in the ZnS nanocrystals possibly because of the formation of the Ni–S bond. With the new electronic states above the valence band created by Ni catching the holes and enhancing the charge separation, the emission intensity at 320 nm in the PL spectra decreased with increasing Ni content (Fig. 9f).40 The broad emission peak located at about 425 nm associated with charge recombination at the VS site also showed a similar trend.

Under visible light irradiation, Kudo et al. evaluated a series of metal sulfide photocatalysts (doped ZnS, ZnS-based solid solutions, and CuGaS2) to reduce CO2 in aqueous solutions containing Na2S and/or K2SO3 as electron donors.37 Among these photocatalysts, Ni-doped ZnS and CuGaS2 (Fig. 10a) demonstrated relatively high activities for HCOOH and CO formation, respectively. Another study showed that the (CuGa)0.5ZnS2 photocatalyst prepared by a flux method reduced CO2 to CO under visible light irradiation with SO32− as a sacrificial electron donor, and the addition of NaHCO3 to the reaction medium improved the CO formation selectivity to 42% (Fig. 10b and c).57 Thus, band engineering is a useful strategy for both HER and CO2RR photocatalyst design. It can also be found that (CuGa)0.5ZnS2 shows better performance than CuGaS2 in reducing CO2 to CO under the same reaction conditions (Fig. 10a and b), which should also benefit from the highly negative conduction band level contributed by the Zn component.

4.2.2 Z-Scheme photocatalytic system. 
Although single photocatalytic systems are simple and could achieve high CO2RR selectivity in the presence of sacrificial agents, realizing the photocatalytic CO2RR in a sacrificial agent-free system (i.e., using water as an electron donor) is the ultimate goal of artificial photosynthesis. In order to use water as the electron donor, a promising strategy is to construct a Z-scheme system.29,58–61 Kudo et al. used a (CuGa)0.5ZnS2 solid solution as the CO2RR photocatalyst and RGO–(CoOx/BiVO4) as the oxygen evolution photocatalyst to construct a Z-scheme system.57 This system realized CO2 reduction with water as the electron donor under visible light irradiation. NaHCO3 has a positive effect on enhancing Z-schematic CO2 reduction due to “pH regulation” and “efficient supply of hydrated CO2”.38 A similar Z-scheme system constructed using Ru-complex grafted (CuGa)1−xZn2xS2 and BiVO4 (Fig. 11a) showed that the CO2 reduction activity depends on the composition of (CuGa)1−xZn2xS2, as x affects its band structure (Fig. 11b and c).30

Zhang et al. designed a solid-state CuGaS2/CdS Z-scheme system.61 This system could successfully solve the problem of the instability of CuGaS2 in the photocatalytic reaction. Under light irradiation, CuGaS2 is inclined to be degraded via the photo-oxidation of Cu+ to Cu2+. CuGaS2/CdS hybrids have a good lattice match at their interface which could favor the Z-scheme charge transfer mechanism (Fig. 11d).61 At the CuGaS2/CdS interface, the injected electrons from CdS to CuGaS2 effectively mitigated the oxidation of Cu+ to Cu2+ and thus inhibited the deactivation of CuGaS2 to maintain the stability of the photocatalytic reaction (Fig. 11e and f). This Z-scheme system is about four times more active than CuGaS2 and three times more active than CdS in the conversion of CO2 to CO. Therefore, the Z-scheme design enables us to design efficient and stable photocatalysts with high-photo-corrosion-tendency semiconductors.
We summarize the performance of the ZnS-based photocatalysts involved in this review in Table 1, from which some key points can be identified. (i) The ZnS-based nanocrystal photocatalysts prepared via the coprecipitation method showed outstanding activities for CO2 reduction to form CO and/or HCOOH under the conditions of an inorganic sacrificial agent. For example, after doping and loading, the CO2 reduction activity of the ZnS-based photocatalyst was significantly increased, and the formic acid selectivity even reached 99%. The isotope tracking detection verified that the carbon source in the products comes entirely from CO2. (ii) Surface acid treatment will promote the photocatalytic CO2RR performance of ZnS-based photocatalysts. (iii) Reasonable regulation of the reaction medium will improve the CO2RR activity. (iv) The Z-scheme system of the ZnS-based photocatalysts can achieve the photocatalytic CO2RR without sacrificial agent systems.

5 Conclusions and outlook
The strategies proposed in this paper could be applied to a wide range of other ZnS-based photocatalysts in future. Taking advantage of the good designability of ZnS, the following aspects can be considered to further improve the activity and selectivity of ZnS-based photocatalysts for CO2 reduction. (i) A sacrificial-agent-free system could be constructed to realize water-based artificial photosynthesis. For example, CO2RR photocatalysts could couple a stable oxygen evolution photocatalyst in a Z-scheme system. (ii) CO2 reduction could couple with other reactions, such as photocatalytic organic reactions62 or enzymatic reactions, to obtain high value-added products and enhance the overall CO2 reduction efficiency. (iii) Nano-sized and quantum dot sulfides with high-density surface states could be a promising type of photocatalyst for CO2 reduction. These surface states63 could potentially activate CO2 molecules. (iv) The bi-cocatalyst (or bi-active-site) design might be a good choice to flexibly modulate the selectivity of H2 and CO in syngas. This will enable us to obtain syngas with the expected H/C ratio to achieve potential applications. (v) The efficiency of CO2 reduction could also be fundamentally boosted through rational design of photoelectric energy conversion and storage devices.64,65 In addition to optimizing the design of photocatalytic systems, it is of great interest to investigate the CO2 activation mechanism with theoretical studies and in situ characterization techniques.
