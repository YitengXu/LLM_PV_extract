    , Accepted 4th March 2021First published on 4th March 2021AbstractHere, we used collinear and noncollinear density functional theory (DFT) methods to explore the interfacial properties of two heterojunctions between a fullerene (C60 and C70) and the MAPbI3(110) surface. Methodologically, consideration of the spin–orbit interaction has been proven to be required to obtain accurate energy-level alignment and interfacial carrier dynamics between fullerenes and perovskites in hybrid perovskite solar cells including heavy atoms (such as Pb atoms). Both heterojunctions are predicted to be the same type-II heterojunction, but the interfacial electron transfer process from MAPbI3 to C60 is completely distinct from that to C70. In the former, the interfacial electron transfer is slow because of the associated large energy gap, and the excited electrons are thus trapped in MAPbI3 for a while. In contrast, in the latter, the smaller energy gap induces ultrafast electron transfer from MAPbI3 to C70. These points are further supported by DFT-based nonadiabatic dynamics simulations including the spin–orbit coupling (SOC) effects. These gained insights could help rationally design superior fullerene–perovskite interfaces to achieve high power conversion efficiencies of fullerene–perovskite solar cells.
Introduction
Significant advances in perovskite solar cells (PSCs), as a cost-effective alternative to conventional solar cells, have been witnessed in the past decade because of their excellent optical and electrical properties, low costs, and high efficiencies.1–7 Although both regulation of perovskite compositions and development of processing technologies have increased the power conversion efficiency of PSCs to ca. 25%,8 many challenges remain for PSCs, including toxicity, hysteresis, etc.9–11 A major drawback of PSCs is their stability, which rapidly degrades under ambient atmosphere, ultraviolet illumination, or elevated temperature.12,13 To overcome this drawback, several new strategies have been adopted, including perovskite material modification, low-dimensional perovskite fabrication, interface engineering, additive engineering, encapsulation, etc.14–20 Among these approaches, the use of fullerenes and their derivatives as efficient electron extraction layers has recently attracted significant experimental attention because of their enhanced device performance, low current hysteresis, passivation of interfacial trap states, and improved stability.21–23 However, the interfacial properties between fullerenes and perovskites in these hybrid PSCs are still far from being completely understood.
Still, a comprehensive understanding of the interfacial properties is critical for interface engineering to rationally design superior fullerene–perovskite interfaces to enhance the overall power conversion efficiencies of PSCs. In the past several years, numerous hybrid PSCs with various fullerene derivatives and perovskites have been extensively explored experimentally.24–35 For example, Jeng et al. explored the interfacial properties of methyl-ammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) and C60 and its derivatives.36 These fullerene acceptors with various lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMOs) can modulate the open-circuit voltages and photovoltaic efficiencies of fullerene-based hybrid PSCs. Gharibzadeh et al. exploited time-resolved optical spectroscopy to explore the photoinduced carrier dynamics at the interface of methyl-ammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) and C70.37 Ultrafast transfer of the photogenerated electrons to C70 was observed. Lin et al. also found that the use of C60/C70 mixed fullerenes as electron transport layers in solution-processed PSCs can result in high photovoltaic efficiencies owing to improved fill factors and open-circuit voltages (see recent review works for details).38–41 Computationally, recent years have witnessed an increasing number of theoretical studies on the structural and electronic properties and radiative and nonradiative processes of various perovskites.42–55 However, few theoretical studies have focused on the interfacial properties of fullerenes and perovskites. More importantly, perovskites usually contain heavy atoms, such as Pb atoms, which are associated with strong spin–orbit coupling (SOC) effects.56,57 These effects are rarely considered in previous theoretical studies on perovskites, and their importance to the interfacial properties of fullerene-based PSCs is still elusive.
Motivated by these issues, in this contribution, we construct two heterojunctions of a fullerene (C60 or C70) and an MA-terminated MAPbI3(110) surface (termed C60@MAPbI3 and C70@MAPbI3) and explore their interfacial electronic properties and photoinduced electron transfer processes. To quantitatively study the SOC effects on these properties, both collinear and noncollinear DFT (PBE and HSE06) methods are employed in the present static electronic structure calculations as well as time-domain nonadiabatic dynamics simulations. Finally, the SOC effects are shown to be indispensable for correct description of the interfacial properties of fullerene-based PSCs.
Simulation details
The fullerene–perovskite heterojunctions of C60@MAPbI3 and C70@MAPbI3 are first constructed by combining the tetragonal-phase MA-terminated MAPbI3(110) surface (three layers) with a C60 or C70 molecule. Moreover, a vacuum space of 20.0 Å perpendicular to the slab surface is used to avoid the arbitrary interaction between two neighbouring images. Finally, two heterojunctions with lattice parameters of a = 13.048 Å, b = 12.445 Å and c = 47.256 Å are built (204 and 214 atoms in total for C60@MAPbI3 and C70@MAPbI3, respectively).
The geometry optimizations and projected density of states (PDOS) calculations are carried out with DFT methods in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP).58–60 The generalized gradient approximation PBE functional is employed in all geometry optimizations.61,62 Electron–ionic core interactions are included by using the projector-augmented wave (PAW) method with a kinetic energy cutoff of 400 eV.63,64 The van der Waals interaction is described by the empirical D3 dispersion correction method of Grimme.65 With the PBE + D3 optimized structures, the PDOSs of both C60@MAPbI3 and C70@MAPbI3 are further explored at the PBE + D3, PBE + SOC + D3, and HSE06 + SOC + D3 levels.66 Among the latter two methods, the SOC effects are explicitly considered by using the two-component noncollinear DFT method implemented in VASP (either PBE or HSE06),67,68 while PBE calculations without the SOC effects are carried out in the framework of the collinear DFT method. Due to the large size of the simulated systems, only the Gamma point is used in all the DFT calculations.
The ground-state molecular dynamics simulations are carried out using the DFT method implemented in the Quickstep module of the CP2K package.69,70 The PBE + D3 method and mixed Gaussian and plane-wave basis sets with an energy cutoff of 750 Ry are used. The DZVP-MOLOPT-SR-GTH basis sets and Goedecker–Teter–Hutter pseudopotentials are also used.71–75 In canonical molecular dynamics simulations, the two systems are first heated to 300 K and equilibrated for 1 ps, in which a time step of 1 fs is used for nuclear propagation and a five-order Nosé–Hoover chain thermostat technique is used to control the temperature.76,77 Subsequently, 1 ps microcanonical dynamics simulations are carried out, based on which a 4 ps trajectory is generated according to the recently used iterative algorithm (see Fig. S1, ESI†).78–80 Then, 100 initial conditions are randomly produced. For each initial condition, 1000 trajectories are prepared, and a total of 100 × 1000 trajectories are run in subsequent noncollinear DFT-based nonadiabatic dynamics simulations (see ESI† for method). Time steps for electronic and nuclear propagation are 0.005 and 1 fs in the dynamics simulations. The lowest 20 unoccupied states from the conduction bands are included in the simulation. The energies of all relevant adiabatic states and interstate couplings needed for nonadiabatic dynamics simulations are calculated using the noncollinear PBE + SOC + D3 method implemented in a locally modified OPENMX3.9 package.81–83 The empirical quantum decoherence correction (0.1 a.u.) of Granucci et al. is used in surface-hopping dynamics simulations.84 In these DFT calculations, standard pseudoatomic-orbital basis sets and norm-conserving pseudopotentials are used. Finally, time-dependent electron amounts (real-time changes in excited electrons) on both C60 and C70 are calculated in terms of the time-dependent occupation number of each adiabatic state averaged over all trajectories.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1 illustrates the PBE + D3 optimized C60@MAPbI3 and C70@MAPbI3 structures.62,65 In both structures, the C60 and C70 molecules are physically adsorbed on the MAPbI3 surface. The adsorption energies are estimated to be 0.41 and 0.77 eV at the PBE + D3 level, which increase to 0.53 and 0.85 eV at the HSE06 + D3 level.66 The larger adsorption energy for the C70@MAPbI3 heterojunction originates from the smaller distance between its C70 and MAPbI3 components, which is estimated to be 1.34 Å at the PBE + D3 level. In comparison, a larger distance of 1.56 Å is found between the C60 and MAPbI3 moieties in the optimized C60@MAPbI3 structure.

Heavy atoms always induce significant SOC interactions, which can regulate, or even completely change, the electronic structure properties of molecules and materials. To quantify the SOC effects on the interfacial properties of C60@MAPbI3 and C70@MAPbI3, we carry out a series of DFT calculations with the collinear and noncollinear PBE + D3 and HSE06 + D3 methods (with and without SOC effects). Overall, all the methods predict that both C60@MAPbI3 and C70@MAPbI3 are type-II heterojunctions in which the conduction band minimum (CBM) is from the C60 or C70 component and the valence band maximum (VBM) is from the MAPbI3 component. Nevertheless, in-depth analysis of the band gaps reveals several very interesting points (see Table 1). First, let us focus on the band gap of the entire heterojunction. The SOC effects clearly significantly reduce the band gaps of C60@MAPbI3 and C70@MAPbI3 (0.48 and 0.51 eV at the PBE + D3 + SOC level versus 0.72 and 0.81 eV at the PBE + D3 level). However, the SOC effects have different influences on the C60 or C70 and MAPbI3 components. Specifically, they hardly change the band gaps of C60 and C70, 1.23 and 1.35 eV at the PBE + D3 level versus 1.23 and 1.39 eV at the PBE + D3 + SOC level. By contrast, the SOC effects are very significant for the MAPbI3 component. The band gaps of MAPbI3 in C60@MAPbI3 and C70@MAPbI3 decrease from 2.04 and 2.04 eV at the PBE + D3 level to 1.29 and 1.26 eV at the PBE + D3 + SOC level (by more than 0.7 eV). This is consistent with the common knowledge that heavy atoms always exhibit strong SOC effects. Since MAPbI3 contains heavy Pb and I atoms and C60 or C70 only contains C atoms, why the former has such strong SOC effects and the latter does not is easily understood.

In addition to the SOC effects, the exchange–correlation functional is crucial for correctly estimating the band gaps. From the PBE + D3 + SOC to HSE06 + D3 + SOC method, the band gaps of C60@MAPbI3 and C70@MAPbI3 increase from 0.48 and 0.51 eV to 1.23 and 1.23 eV (by more than 0.7 eV). When individually considering the band gaps of C60 or C70 and MAPbI3, one can find that the HSE06 + D3 + SOC calculated band gap of MAPbI3 approaches those calculated by the PBE + D3 method without the SOC effects, e.g., 2.01 and 1.95 eV versus 2.04 and 2.04 eV in C60@MAPbI3 and C70@MAPbI3. This means that the SOC effects counter-balance the energy gap between the PBE and HSE06 exchange–correlation functionals. This is why previous PBE calculations can give reasonably accurate band gaps for isolated MAPbI3 materials. Nevertheless, the specific PDOS, relative energy levels of defects, and carrier wave-functions should be different with and without the SOC effects.85–87 This interesting offset does not hold for C60 or C70 because the SOC effects are essentially negligible for the C atoms (see Table 1). Compared with those at the PBE + D3 + SOC level, the band gaps of C60 and C70 are significantly increased to 1.86 and 1.92 eV at the HSE06 + D3 + SOC level (by more than 0.5 eV). Taken together, these results show that accurate alignment of energy levels between the C60 or C70 and MAPbI3 components in these fullerene-based hybrid PSCs requires the use of the accurate HSE06 functional and the simultaneous inclusion of the SOC effects. This point should be valid for similar heterojunctions of organic materials and perovskites with heavy atoms.
Furthermore, the SOC effects significantly affect the energy-level alignment between the fullerene (C60 or C70) and MAPbI3 components in C60@MAPbI3 and C70@MAPbI3, especially for their conduction bands. In the former, without the SOC effects, the second CBM of C60 is energetically much lower than the MAPbI3 CBM, but the SOC effects reverse the situation with either the PBE or HSE06 functional (see the left panels in Fig. 2). In contrast, the SOC effects narrow the energy gap between the second CBM of C70 and the MAPbI3 CBM in C70@MAPbI3, leading to a comparable overlap (see the right panels in Fig. 2). Therefore, expecting that the SOC effects can induce qualitatively different photoinduced carrier dynamics at the interfaces of C60@MAPbI3 and C70@MAPbI3 is reasonable. In addition, although the PBE + D3 + SOC method underestimates the band gaps, it still gives a similar energy-level alignment for the conduction bands of the fullerenes and MAPbI3 components in comparison with those calculated by the HSE06 + D3 + SOC method. The corresponding energy differences calculated by both PBE + SOC and HSE06 + SOC methods are found to be less than 0.1 eV on average (Table S1, ESI†). Therefore, the much more efficient PBE + D3 + SOC method is exploited to replace the expensive HSE06 + D3 + SOC method in the dynamics simulations.88,89

It is commonly known that GGA functionals underestimate band gaps, which can be certainly corrected by the many-body GW method. However, it should be stressed again that our present work does not focus on band-gap-related properties, but on the photoinduced interfacial electron transfer dynamics. For these processes, the relative energy difference of the conduction bands of the fullerenes and perovskites is more important. From Fig. 2, it is clear that both PBE + SOC and HSE06 + SOC give nearly same energy-level alignment. Thus, the PBE + SOC method is fine for our studied problems. Of course, directly using the GW + SOC method is more appealing; but, its computational cost is still not affordable.
To explore the electron transfer in a quantitative way, a noncollinear DFT-based nonadiabatic dynamics simulation including the SOC effects is carried out (see the ESI† for methods and simulation details). In the present dynamics simulation, we only focus on the photoinduced interfacial electron transfer with the lowest Eg electronic transition, which excites an electron to the MAPbI3 CBM in either C60@MAPbI3 or C70@MAPbI3. Nevertheless, there are visible differences between them. In C60@MAPbI3, no overlap occurs between the second conduction band of C60 and the MAPbI3 CBM state; hence, it has a relatively pure spatial distribution. In stark contrast, in C70@MAPbI3, the MAPbI3 CBM state and the second conduction band of C70 exhibit an obvious overlap. This point is obvious from Fig. 3. The charge density of the MAPbI3 CBM state of C70@MAPbI3 is distributed on both MAPbI3 and C70; whereas, that of the MAPbI3 CBM state of C60@MAPbI3 is merely localized on MAPbI3. In comparison, the relevant C60 or C70 states are much more localized spatially.

As discussed, both C60@MAPbI3 and C70@MAPbI3 are type-II heterojunctions in which the MAPbI3 CBM is higher than the C60 or C70 CBM (with the SOC effects). Therefore, photoinduced interfacial electron transfer from MAPbI3 to C60 or C70 is allowed in energy (see the bottom panels of Fig. 2). Nevertheless, obvious differences can be observed. First, the MAPbI3 CBM is much higher than the C60 CBM in C60@MAPbI3, and no overlap occurs between their first conduction bands (see panel e). However, the second conduction band of C60 is higher than the MAPbI3 CBM. In this case, interfacial electron transfer from MAPbI3 to C60 is greatly suppressed. The situation for C70@MAPbI3 is different. Similar to C60@MAPbI3, a large energy gap exists between the first conduction bands of MAPbI3 and C70, but the second conduction band of C70 is lower than the MAPbI3 CBM. Importantly, these two conduction bands have a comparable overlap (see panel f). These conditions induce ultrafast electron transfer from MAPbI3 to C70. Finally, notably, the above discussed dynamical behaviours will become completely different without the SOC effects because of the qualitatively different energy-level alignment (see the top panels of Fig. 2). These comparisons demonstrate the importance of the SOC effects for the correct description of the interfacial electronic properties of fullerene-based PSCs.

Fig. 4 shows the time-dependent electron amounts (real-time changes in the number of electrons) located on C60 and C70 in C60@MAPbI3 and C70@MAPbI3 upon photoirradiation. In the former, within the 500 fs simulation time, interfacial electron transfer clearly does not occur from MAPbI3 to C60. These dynamical results coincide with the above electronic structure calculations. As shown in Fig. 5, a large energy gap exists between the second CBM of C60 and the MAPbI3 CBM (see the left panel of Fig. 5). The energy gap of E7–E6 averaged over all trajectories is calculated to be approximately 9.0 kcal mol−1. This makes the relevant electronic transitions relatively very slow. Therefore, one cannot observe any interfacial electron transfer process in C60@MAPbI3 within the 500 fs simulation time.

Compared with C60@MAPbI3, the photoinduced interfacial carrier dynamics are strikingly different in C70@MAPbI3. First, initially, a small amount of excited electrons appears on C70 because the MAPbI3 CBM tails into C70 (see Fig. 3). Second, the electron amount transferred to C70 sharply increases from ca. 0.2 to 0.6 in the first 100 fs. Afterwards, it becomes saturated. Detailed analysis reveals that the ultrafast interfacial electron transfer to C70 in the first 100 fs originates from the good overlap between the first conduction band of MAPbI3 and the second conduction band of C70 (see the above discussion and Fig. 2). This leads to very small energy gaps between the MAPbI3 CBM and the acceptor states of C70 (on average 2.4 kcal mol−1; see the central panel in Fig. 5). Therefore, one can observe fast and tremendous electron transfer to C70 in the initial phase. However, the transferred electrons are trapped in the second conduction band of C70 for a while because of the large energy gap between its first and second conduction bands, which is further confirmed by the related time-dependent electron population (see Fig. S2, ESI†).
The averaged energy gap is calculated to be ca. 7.7 kcal mol−1 (see the right panel of Fig. 5). This is the reason why one cannot observe further interfacial electron transfer to C70; instead, the amount of electrons on C70 becomes stable after 100 fs in the dynamics simulation (see the bottom panel of Fig. 4).
In terms of the preceding electronic structure calculations and nonadiabatic dynamics simulations, Fig. 6 summarizes the photoinduced interfacial carrier dynamics in C60@MAPbI3 and C70@MAPbI3. The lowest Eg electronic excitation will produce an excited electron in the MAPbI3 CBM. In C60@MAPbI3, the interfacial electron transfer is very slow and is not observed in the 500 fs nonadiabatic dynamics simulation because of the large energy gap of approximately 9.0 kcal mol−1 (on average) between the first conduction bands of C60 and MAPbI3. In comparison, in C70@MAPbI3, ultrafast interfacial electron transfer occurs in the first phase due to the small energy gap between the MAPbI3 CBM and the acceptor states of C70 (on average 2.4 kcal mol−1). This process results in 60% electron transfer to C70 from MAPbI3 in the first 100 fs. However, further electron relaxation within C70 is heavily suppressed due to the large energy gap between its first and second conduction bands.

Conclusions
We have used collinear and noncollinear DFT methods to explore the interfacial properties of two fullerene–perovskite heterojunctions, i.e., C60@MAPbI3 and C70@MAPbI3. On the basis of the present results, we can obtain several new and important insights. Methodologically, we have found that the PBE functional without the SOC interaction gives accurate MAPbI3 band gaps, similar to those calculated by the HSE06 functional with the SOC interaction; however, when not including the SOC effects, the energy-level alignment between the C60 or C70 and MAPbI3 components is qualitatively incorrect. Therefore, explicitly considering the SOC effects is necessary for accurate description of the interfacial electronic properties of these fullerene-based perovskites and possibly heterojunctions formed between organic and inorganic materials that include heavy atoms because of their remarkable SOC effects.85–87,90,91
For the interfacial properties, the two-component noncollinear HSE06 + D3 + SOC calculations show that both C60@MAPbI3 and C70@MAPbI3 are type-II heterojunctions and that interfacial electron transfer from MAPbI3 to C60 or C70 is thermodynamically allowed; however, the detailed interfacial electron transfer processes in these two heterojunctions are distinct. In the former, the interfacial electron transfer is very slow because of the large energy gap between the MAPbI3 CBM and the first conduction band of C60, which leads to the excited electrons being trapped for a while, whereas in the latter, the small energy gap between the MAPbI3 CBM and the second conduction band of C70 facilitates ultrafast electron transfer from MAPbI3 to C70. Similarly, the transferred electrons will be trapped in the second conduction band of C70 before they hop to the first conduction band due to the associated large energy gap. These viewpoints inferred from electronic structure calculations are verified by time-domain nonadiabatic dynamics simulations with SOC effects. Specifically, in C60@MAPbI3, no electron transfer to C60 is observed in the 500 fs simulation time, while in C70@MAPbI3, approximately 60% of excited electrons flow into C70 on an ultrafast timescale of ca. 100 fs.
Finally, our work clearly shows that the interfacial properties of C60@MAPbI3 and C70@MAPbI3 are different, considering the relative energy-level alignment between the C60 or C70 and MAPbI3 components. These different electronic properties lead to the distinct interfacial electron transfer dynamics and charge injection efficiencies at the interfaces. Time-domain nonadiabatic dynamics simulations reveal that a much higher charge-separation efficiency is present at the interface of C70@MAPbI3 than at that of C60@MAPbI3. On the basis of the present results, C70 is highly expected to exhibit better optoelectronic properties than C60 in fullerene-based hybrid PSCs. These gained insights could help the design of superior fullerene–perovskite interfaces to achieve high power conversion efficiencies of hybrid PSCs.

 	Fig. 1  PBE + D3 optimized heterojunction structures of (left) C60 or (right) C70 and MA-terminated tetragonal MAPbI3(110) surfaces (referred to as C60@MAPbI3 and C70@MAPbI3).	 

C60@MAPbI3
MAPbI3	2.04	1.29	2.01
C60	1.23	1.23	1.86
C60@MAPbI3	0.72	0.48	1.23
C70@MAPbI3
MAPbI3	2.04	1.26	1.95
C70	1.35	1.39	1.92
C70@MAPbI3	0.81	0.51	1.23

 	Fig. 2  PDOS of both (left) C60@MAPbI3 and (right) C70@MAPbI3 heterojunctions calculated using different exchange–correlation functionals with and without SOC effects. (a and b) Collinear PBE + D3 method without SOC effects; (c and d) noncollinear PBE + D3 method with SOC effects; (e and f) noncollinear HSE06 + D3 method with SOC effects.	 

 	Fig. 3  PBE + SOC + D3 calculated charge densities of frontier states of (top) C60@MAPbI3 and (bottom) C70@MAPbI3 relevant to the interfacial electron transfer dynamics. They are arranged from left to right in the order of orbital energies (eV).	 

 	Fig. 4  Time-dependent electron amounts transferred to either C60 or C70 from MAPbI3 in nonadiabatic dynamics simulations.	 

 	Fig. 5  Energy gaps of (left) E7–E6 of C60@MAPbI3, (central) Ei+1–Ei (i = 14–7), and (right) E7–E6 of C70@MAPbI3 in nonadiabatic dynamics simulations. Also shown are averaged energy gaps.	 

 	Fig. 6  Schematic diagrams for the photoinduced interfacial electron transfer between the C60 or C70 and MAPbI3 components in the C60@MAPbI3 and C70@MAPbI3 heterojunctions.
