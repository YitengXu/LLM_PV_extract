    First published on 17th July 2018AbstractZero-dimensional (0D) black phosphorus quantum dots (BPQDs) are emerging functional nanomaterials. 0D BPQDs are a new form of black phosphorus (BP) nanostructures that were first prepared in 2015; they are different from typical two-dimensional (2D) BP layered nanosheets and one-dimensional (1D) BP nanoribbons. Since 2015, numerous studies have been devoted to exploring various synthetic methods, properties and modifications of BPQDs, which exhibit a broad range of applications. This review systematically summarizes PBQDs for the first time. Different synthetic methods are reviewed, including ultrasonic and electrochemical exfoliation, solvothermal treatment, blender breaking, milling crushing and pulsed laser irradiation. We highlight the physicochemical properties of BPQDs from theoretical models and discuss their experimentally observed properties. The surface modifications and functionalized combination of BPQDs with other substances are summarized by illustrating different hybrid structures, such as BPQDs/nanosheets hybrids, BPQDs-doping films, BPQDs-molecules complexes, polymers-modified BPQDs, and the assembly of BPQDs in devices. The potential applications of BPQDs are demonstrated in current research fields, including bioimaging, fluorescence sensing, nonlinear optical absorbers, cancer therapy, intelligent electronics, photovoltaics, optoelectronics and flexible devices. The current status, challenges and future perspectives of PBQDs are discussed rationally. This timely overall review should be desirable for broad scientists and facilitate the further development of layered nanostructures-derived QDs and other low-dimensional nanomaterials.

1. Introduction
In view of their unique electronic and structural properties, atomically thin two-dimensional (2D) materials are attractive for future nanoelectronic devices.1 Since its discovery in 2004,2 graphene has become the most commonly used 2D material because it exhibits high performance in optical transparency, thermal conductivity and carrier mobility.3–8 However, graphene has no band gap and therefore suffers from limitations for some electronic and optoelectronic applications.9 During the past decade, other layered 2D materials, such as transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), silicene, germanene and black phosphorus (BP), have shown great promise in applications for electronic and optoelectronic devices due to their outstanding physical and structural properties.10–13 As a new member of the 2D material family, BP has recently started to gain increasing attention because of its finite band gap, high carrier mobility and large on–off current ratios.14
Phosphorus is one of the essential elements for maintaining good health in the human body; it has three major allotropes, including white phosphorus (WP), red phosphorus (RP) and BP. WP, which has a tetrahedral structure, is chemically unstable due to large bond strain. RP possesses an amorphous structure and better chemical stability than WP. In contrast, BP is the most stable allotrope and is also nonflammable and insoluble in most solvents.15,16 BP was first discovered in 1914;17 however, it did not attract much attention over the past century, which is mainly attributed to its harsh preparation conditions and few applications.15 In recent years, layered bulk BP has been mechanically exfoliated into monolayer or few-layer BP (phosphorene) resulting from weak van der Waals forces between stacked layers.18 In addition to mechanical exfoliation, previous reports have described the preparation of BP nanostructures from liquid exfoliation of bulk BP crystals.19–21
In comparison with other 2D layered nanomaterials, nanoscale BP can be distinguished by its puckered structures along the armchair direction and its bilayer configuration along the zigzag direction (Scheme 1).22 This structural anisotropy leads to some unique properties of BP, such as electronic conductivity, optical, thermoelectric, and topological features, and unusual mechanical behavior (negative Poisson's ratio).23–28 In contrast to the zero band gap of graphene (without an on–off ratio) and the large band gap of TMDs (1.1 to 2.5 eV, 200 cm2 V−1 s−1), BP exhibits a tunable, direct and thickness-dependent band gap, a moderate on–off ratio of 104 to 105 and a sufficiently high carrier mobility of up to 104 cm2 V−1 s−1.29 Due to the interesting layer-dependent band gap that can be tuned from 0.3 eV (bulk) to 2.0 eV (single layer),30 BP nanostructures prepared from mechanical and chemical (liquid-phase) exfoliation methods demonstrate great promise in many significant areas, including field-effect transistors, lithium-ion batteries, demodulators, memory devices, diodes, and photodetectors.31–37

In addition to 2D BP layered structures, one-dimensional (1D) phosphorene nanoribbons have been explored; their electronic properties are highly sensitive to the edge-structure, edge-type and edge-width.38–41 Most recently, another BP nanostructure, zero-dimensional (0D) BP quantum dots (QDs), was synthesized by chemical methods.42,43 A breakthrough in the preparation of BPQDs was first achieved by Zhang and co-workers in 2015.42 They put forward a facile liquid-phase ultrasonic technique (exfoliation from bulk BP crystals or BP powders) to produce BPQDs that showed great potential in flexible memory devices. After that, the interesting photothermal conversion behavior of BPQDs was explored, which indicated their potential for applications in photothermal cancer therapy.43 To date, many important applications of BPQDs have been explored in succession; these cover a broad range of fields, especially bioimaging, fluorescence sensing, nonlinear optical absorbers, cancer therapy, intelligent electronic elements, photovoltaics, optoelectronics and flexible devices.42–61 Based on the unique properties of BP nanostructures, these emerging BPQDs have demonstrated great potential for many significant applications. There is an urgent requirement for a timely overall review that summarizes the current advances, challenges and near-future prospects of BPQDs, aiming to promote further development in BPQDs-related research fields.
Before we proceed with the present review, we will refer to previous reviews on BP with different dimensions and structures. The first review of semiconducting layered BP was reported by Liu et al. in 2015.62 They traced the research history of BP over one century. Afterward, Eswaraiah et al. reviewed the recent advances in BP nanosheets.63 Recently, other reviews have been published; however, they wholly focus on 2D layered BP nanostructures.13,64–67 To date, there is still no review that focuses on 0D BP nanostructures (BPQDs). In our present review, we systematically summarize BPQDs, which have emerged as advanced functional nanomaterials in recent years because of their unique properties and potential significant applications. At the beginning, this review introduces the discovery and development of BP nanostructures from layered bulk BP crystals, 2D few-layer BP nanosheets and 1D BP nanoribbons to 0D BPQDs. The synthetic methods of BPQDs are summarized carefully, mainly focusing on ultrasonic and electrochemical exfoliation, solvothermal treatment, blender breaking, milling crushing and pulsed laser irradiation. Regarding the properties of BPQDs, we highlight their physicochemical properties from theoretical models and discuss their experimentally observed properties. Functionalized modifications of BPQDs include BPQDs/nanosheets hybrids, BPQDs-doping films, BPQDs-molecules complexes, polymers-modified BPQDs, and the assembly of BPQDs in devices. We highlight the potential applications of BPQDs in currently active fields, including bioimaging, fluorescence sensing, nonlinear optical absorbers, cancer therapy, intelligent electronic elements, photovoltaic, optoelectronic and flexible devices (Scheme 2). Current research advances, challenges and future prospects for PBQDs are discussed rationally. This timely overall review is desirable for numerous scientists from broad research fields and may accelerate the further development of layered nanostructures-derived QDs or other low-dimensional nanomaterials.

2. Synthesis methods of BPQDs
In 2015, Zhang et al. first reported the preparation of BPQDs from bulk BP crystals using a facile top-down (solution phase) method.42 Micrometer-size bulk BP crystals were synthesized from RP under high pressure (4 GPa) and high temperature (800 °C, 10 min). The obtained bulk BP was maintained in a glove box filled with Ar gas (<0.1 ppm H2O and O2) prior to use.77 Afterward, different synthetic methods for preparing BPQDs were explored in succession. After an overall search in Web of Science, we provide a brief summary (Table 1) of the synthetic methods of BPQDs. Ultrasonic liquid-phase exfoliation is widely used to prepare BPQDs. Other synthetic methods mainly involve electrochemical exfoliation, solvothermal treatment, blender breaking, milling crushing and pulsed laser irradiation.

2.1. Ultrasonic exfoliation
Despite the recent progress in the mechanical exfoliation of BP nanosheets,92,93 it is still highly challenging to produce new BP nanostructures in high yield. A facile solution-based method (e.g. ultrasonic exfoliation in solution) is highly attractive for preparing new BP nanostructures, such as the emerging BPQDs. Zhang et al. first synthesized BPQDs by means of liquid-phase ultrasonic exfoliation.42 BP powder and N-methyl pyrrolidone (NMP) were mixed and milled in a mortar. The mixture was sonicated (200 W) in an ice bath for 3 h, followed by centrifugation (7000 rpm) for 20 min. The supernatant containing BPQDs was decanted. Commonly, liquid exfoliation is used to isolate 2D layered materials and prepare QDs. When this method is utilized for preparing graphene and TMDs-based (MoS2) QDs, it usually suffers from wide size distribution and relatively low yield. Therefore, scientists integrated the grinding and sonicating processes to exfoliate bulk BP crystals in solution phase, promoting the generation of high-yield BPQDs. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) have been used to characterize BPQDs. In Fig. 1, the average diameter is 4.9 nm, and the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images indicate lattice fringes of 0.34 nm and 0.52 nm, assigned to the (021) and (020) planes of BP crystal. The heights from the AFM images are 2.7 nm and 1.6 nm, indicating BPQDs with approximately 5 and 3 layers. Statistical AFM analysis provides an average thickness of 1.9 ± 0.9 nm, corresponding to 4 ± 2 layers.

(Reproduced with permission from ref. 42, Copyright 2015, Wiley.) 
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) has been used to analyze the chemical compositions of BPQDs. A predominant P2p peak appears at 129.9 eV, and the O1s peak is located at 532.1 eV. BP is sensitive to H2O and O2 and can be degraded to PxOy under visible light irradiation. The O signal arises from BP oxidation, which is mainly attributed to the exposure of BP samples to the atmosphere. In the high-resolution P2p spectrum, two peaks at 130.3 eV and 129.5 eV are assignable to the 2p1/2 and 2p3/2 binding energies, respectively. A peak in the high-energy region of 133.9 eV suggests oxidation of the BPQDs. Since the first report on BPQDs,42 great effort has been devoted to different synthetic methods of BPQDs. As summarized in Table 1, scientists are focusing on facile and efficient ultrasonic liquid-phase exfoliation. Sun et al. developed a two-step ultrasonic strategy to prepare BPQDs using BP powder as the precursor and NMP as the solvent.43 BP powder was sonicated by probes into BP nanosheets, followed by ice-bath sonication into BPQDs. The probe and bath sonication methods are commonly used in exfoliating 2D layered materials. Compared with probe sonication, bath sonication can break bulk BP into smaller particles; however, use of bath sonication alone may result in irregular BP nanosheets. Compared with the strategy of grinding BP crystals into powders,42 probe sonication is reproducible and enables the use of commercial bulk BP crystals as the starting material. The combination of probe sonication and bath sonication facilitates the exfoliation of bulk BP crystals into ultra-small BPQDs.
In the preparation of BPQDs, ultrasonic exfoliation is extensively employed. Bulk BP crystals are ground into powders as the starting materials. In probe sonication, bulk BP crystals can be directly used as the starting materials without grinding treatment. Both the grinding and sonicating processes are accompanied by abundant release of heat; hence, ice-bath sonication or low-temperature cooling is required.42,43,52,56–59,68–73 NMP is widely used as the solvent for bulk BP crystals and BP powders during the preparation of BPQDs by ultrasonic exfoliation. In addition to NMP, other solvents, such as N-vinyl pyrrolidone (NVP),68 isopropanol (IPA),50 and dimethyl formamide (DMF),72 are utilized as organic solvents for the starting materials. As summarized in Table 1, BPQDs prepared from ultrasonic exfoliation at a higher sonication power (1200 W) exhibit smaller sizes (lateral or height/thickness diameter). High-power ultrasonic exfoliation helps break the bulk BP crystals/powders into smaller particles. An extended sonication time benefits the achievement of small BPQDs, ensuring adequate breaking of the starting materials under similar sonication powers. Moreover, a high sonication power and an extended sonication time can promote monodispersity of the BPQDs, which may be crucial for improving their physicochemical properties and multifunctional applications.
When preparing BPQDs by ultrasonic exfoliation, scientists conducted some interesting studies. Lee et al. reported a facile preparation of BP-nanodots.55 BP was dispersed in distilled water and treated with high-intensity ultrasound irradiation (20 kHz, 100 W) to produce several-layered BP-nanodots. In comparison with probe sonication and bath sonication, the efficiency of high-intensity ultrasound irradiation is relatively low. The BP-nanodots have larger sizes (10 nm in width, 8.7 nm in height) and a broad size distribution; this is detrimental to some their physicochemical properties, such as fluorescence. Additionally, the solvent has an important role in the preparation of nanomaterials. Low-polar solvents not only act as stabilizers, but also improve the monodispersity of the products. The integration of probe sonication and bath sonication together with the use of low-polar solvents is rationally proposed for preparing high-quality BPQDs. Gao et al. synthesized ultrathin BPQDs from small molecules-assisted liquid-phase exfoliation.69 Phytic acid contains hydroxyl and phosphorus groups that readily interact with BP, which increases the solubility of BP in solvent and the efficiency of liquid exfoliation. When phytic acid was used as an additive in NMP to exfoliate bulk BP, ultrathin BPQDs were obtained. With the assistance of phytic acid, the liquid-phase ultrasonic exfoliation of bulk BP was accelerated and the sonication period to obtain BPQDs with few-layered BP was remarkably decreased.
2.2. Electrochemical exfoliation
In addition to liquid-phase ultrasonic exfoliation to prepare BPQDs, electrochemical exfoliation with bipolar electrodes to prepare BP nanoparticles (NPs) has been reported.54 Bipolar electrodes can produce opposite potentials on the opposite ends of BP microparticles (MPs), leading to decomposition of the BP MPs into NPs (Fig. 2). Prior to this work, many studies were dedicated to the exploration of efficient methods for downsizing and exfoliating layered BP crystals into QDs or NPs; however, all of these were based on mechanical forces, such as ultrasonication (Table 1). Mayorga-Martinez et al. developed a solution-based electrochemical exfoliation method to fabricate BP NPs. A potential difference was induced on the BP particles at opposite sides, resulting in fragmentation of the BP particles into NPs. The characteristic dark color of the BP MPs solution disappeared. The BP NPs suspension was prepared by an exfoliation process. Scanning TEM (STEM) images exhibited platelet-like particles. The hydrodynamic radii of the BP NPs were close to 70 nm, measured from dynamic light scattering (DLS). Characteristic absorption bands at the UV and near-infrared (NIR) regions were observed in the optical absorption spectra of BP NPs. In the high-resolution XPS spectra of BP crystals and NPs, characteristic phosphorus and surface oxidation features were observed. The electrochemical exfoliation approach only involves the fabrication of BP NPs with larger sizes, rather than small BPQDs; however, it is conceptually new and can be used as an additional treatment before ultrasonic exfoliation. The combination of two different exfoliation techniques is significant and improves the preparation efficiency of BPQDs in solution.

2.3. Solvothermal treatment
Solvothermal approaches can be used to prepare BPQDs.47 Bulk BP as the precursor was dispersed in NMP and maintained for 12 h at 140 °C under vigorous stirring and N2 protection. The reaction solution became light yellow, and the products were obtained by centrifugation. The BPQDs had an average diameter of 1.76 nm, much smaller than most previous reports (Table 1). The thickness of the BPQDs was ca. 1.2 nm, indicating a bilayer structure. Wang et al. synthesized BPQDs based on BP powder milled from bulk BP crystals.53 BP powder was mixed with NMP and NaOH, followed by heating to 140 °C for 6 h in N2. The suspension was centrifuged to separate the non-exfoliated BP crystals. The BPQDs dispersed in the yellow supernatant had an average lateral size of 2.48 nm. Xu et al. prepared BP powder-derived ultra-small QDs on a large scale, using a solvothermal method (Fig. 3).74 BP crystal was ground into powder and added to NMP containing saturated NaOH. The mixture was maintained under vigorous stirring for 6 h at 140 °C in N2 atmosphere. NMP serves as a suitable organic solvent to exfoliate 2D materials. This NaOH-saturated NMP solution can improve the stability of BP nanosheets and QDs.

Characterization of BPQDs: (b) TEM image, (c) magnified TEM image, (d) HRTEM image, (e) statistical analysis of the lateral sizes of 100 BPQDs determined by TEM, (f) Raman spectra and (g) absorption spectrum with an inset photograph of an NMP solution of the BPQDs. (Reproduced with permission from ref. 74, Copyright 2016, Wiley.) 
TEM images demonstrated the existence of ultra-small BPQDs. The lattice fringe in the HRTEM image is 0.573 nm, corresponding to the (020) plane of BP crystals. The average lateral size is 2.1 nm according to the statistical TEM analysis of 100 BPQDs. Three typical Raman peaks of BP were assigned to the out-of-plane vibration mode from A1g and the in-plane vibration modes from B2g and A2g, respectively. Using a silicon peak at 520.7 cm−1 as the calibration standard, the three Raman peaks of bulk BP are all red-shifted, proving the relatively low average thickness of the BPQDs. A sharp peak appears around 435 nm in the linear absorption spectrum of the BPQDs. In comparison with mechanical and liquid-phase exfoliation techniques, solvothermal treatment is facile and controllable to produce ultra-small BPQDs on a large scale.
2.4. Blender breaking
Although a variety of synthetic methods have been explored to prepare BPQDs, facile, rapid and efficient synthetic methods are currently challenging and highly needed. Zhu et al. reported an ultrafast top-down synthesis of BPQDs using a household kitchen blender.44 Due to the highly turbulent shear rate, layer-by-layer disintegration of bulk BP crystals occurred, which led to the formation of BPQDs. In the disintegrating process (Fig. 4), bulk BP crystals were dispersed in dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) and treated with a household kitchen blender. When the blender was turned on, the BP crystals were rapidly lifted off the bottom of the vessel. DMSO as the stabilizing solvent has an appropriate surface energy to disrupt the van der Waals forces between the BP interlayers. When the BP crystals were exfoliated and disintegrated under a high-shear turbulence flow, the color of the dispersion changed to brown and a BPQDs dispersion eventually formed. Large quantities of uniform BPQDs appeared, indicating the feasibility of preparing BPQDs using a kitchen blender. The BPQDs were well-crystallized, and the lattice fringes of 0.26 nm and 0.25 nm are as attributed to the (040) and (111) planes of BP crystals. The average size of the BPQDs is 2.25 nm. The height profile reveals thicknesses of 0.58 to 1.45 nm, indicating mono- to double-layered BPQDs. The statistical AFM analysis suggests a narrow size distribution and an average thickness of 0.92 nm. The AFM-measured thickness of layered 2D materials is slightly higher than the theoretical results due to substrate roughness. The method of using a kitchen blender is ultrafast, scalable and efficient. The BPQDs have uniform, ultra-small sizes and well-crystallized structures. This work shows a successful paradigm of preparing QDs from layered materials.

2.5. Milling crushing
A facile method to prepare few-layered thin BP NPs by milling crushing was reported.75 BP crystals were milled in an agate mortar and ultrasonicated in solvent, followed by milling for 30 min. The BP suspension in solvent was milled with an Ultra Turrax disperser and speeded in DMF (or NMP, acetonitrile, or bis(2-methoxyethyl) ether (DIGLYM)). The milling time was prolonged to 6 h and the BP NPs were separated by centrifugation. Depending on the milling speed, period and solvent, the average diameters of the BP NPs differed from 80 nm to 200 nm. The quality yield of BP NPs from the milling process was dependent on the type of solvent. Under high-speed centrifugation, small BP NPs or QDs were obtained that formed stable colloidal suspensions in NMP and DMF.
Sun et al. prepared BP NPs from RP by a solventless high-energy mechanical milling technique.60 RP powder and stainless steel balls were loaded in a hardened steel vial. After addition of polyethylene glycol (PEG), the mixture was milled for 72 h to produce a black powder dispersed in H2O. After centrifugation and dialysis, a solution of PEGylated BP NPs was obtained. Black powder (Fig. 5) indicates the generation of BP. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns suggest standard orthorhombic BP. Compared with RP, the much sharper Raman peaks imply well-crystallized BP. The TEM images show uniform BP NPs with sizes of ∼3.2 nm. The HRTEM images display lattice fringes with an interplanar spacing of 0.217 nm, revealing the (002) plane of BP. Fast Fourier transform (FFT) images testify the single-crystalline feature of the BP NPs, with heights of 0.85 to 1.53 nm. Based on statistical analysis of the AFM images, the average height is ∼1.2 nm. Two distinct peaks at 129.3 eV and 130.2 eV in the P2p spectrum are assigned to the 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 orbits of zero-valent P0. A broad peak at 133.9 eV arises from oxidized phosphorus, P5+. Partial oxidization of P0 occurs during sample preparation and purification because the BP nanostructure surface is sensitive to oxygen and moisture. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra show absorption bands of the BP NPs at ∼1000 cm−1, 1200 cm−1 and 1620 cm−1 (P–O, P–P–O, PO stretching modes).

2.6. Pulsed laser irradiation
BPQDs can be prepared by ultrasonic exfoliation in NMP.42 These QDs cannot be used as photoluminescence (PL) materials because NMP solvent has a strong emission. Ge et al. reported nanoscale phosphorene QDs (PQDs) with few-layer structures obtained by pulsed laser ablation of bulk BP in diethyl ether.76 Pulsed laser ablation of solid materials in liquids is a clean and tunable technique for the preparation of metal NPs, semiconductor NPs and carbon-related nanomaterials. PQDs were prepared in diethyl ether using a 1064 nm Nd:YAG pulsed laser with a repetition rate of 5 Hz, an energy of 30 mJ pulse−1 and a pulse width of 6 ns. Bulk BP was placed at the bottom of the vessel with diethyl ether. The pulsed laser was used to ablate the BP for 20 min to obtain PQDs. The average size of the PQDs was ∼7 nm. Lattice fringes of 0.53 nm, 0.34 nm and 0.26 nm were assigned to the (020), (021) and (040) planes of BP crystals. The PQDs retained puckered hexagonal structures. The A2g/A1g ratio and red shifts in the A1g, B2g and A2g modes of the PQDs imply the formation of PQDs with few-layer structures and small sizes. The intense and stable PL emissions of the PQDs in the blue-violet region are ascribed to electronic transitions from the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) to the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the occupied molecular orbital below the HOMO (H−1, H−2).
3. Properties of BPQDs
As briefly summarized in Table 2, BPQDs exhibit many important properties that suggest significant applications in broad fields. These properties are closely related to the unique microstructures of BPQDs. We discuss these properties and highlight their possible mechanisms. As newly emerging advanced functional nanomaterials, the unique properties of BPQDs, including their energy spectra and states and optical and electronic properties, are of interest in wide research fields. In this section, we highlight the physicochemical properties of BPQDs from theoretical models and discuss their experimentally observed properties.

3.1. Energy spectra and energy states
The bilayer triangular energy spectra of PQDs have been theoretically studied.78 Scientists have investigated the confined states of bilayer triangular PQDs through a tight-binding approach. An external electric field can effectively turn the energy levels of the edge states in both layers in opposite directions. With increasing magnetic field intensity, the magnetic energy levels can reach the Landau level of the phosphorene monolayer, bilayer or both, depending on the specific geometry of the layered hybrid PQDs. These results increase understanding of the electronic properties of multilayer hybrid phosphorene structures. Lino et al. investigated the charging energy spectra of BPQDs and performed a theoretical evaluation of the charging effects in single or double layered BPQDs with lateral sizes of 2 and 3 nm.79 When structural instability arises, the charging of BPQDs can store up to Nmax electrons, depending on the lateral sizes and layer numbers of the QDs. The average energy (EA) of single-layer QDs is higher than that of double-layer QDs of the same size. The charging energy of BPQDs is dependent on the substrate. The drain-to-source voltage (eVds ≈ EA) and the long lifetime of the charge in QDs can be tailored by the design of devices. BPQDs can be developed as excellent candidates for single (or few) electron transistor (SET) devices.
A common tight-binding approach was adopted to calculate the single-particle states. The configuration interaction formalism was used to determine the exciton spectra.80 Sousa et al. studied size-dependent exciton fine structures in monolayer (ML) BPQDs deposited on different substrates. The substrates (isolated Si and SiO2) play dramatic roles in the exciton gaps and spectra of the QDs. The exciton lifetimes show a strong temperature dependence, ranging from 2 to 8 ns (Si) to 3 to 11 ns (SiO2) for QDs. Nearly circular BPQDs were formed by producing a large ML BP sheet with the armchair (zigzig) direction aligned to the x(y) axis. The dot shape is based on samples produced by exfoliation without uniform edges. Fig. 6 shows the size-dependent single-particle spectra of ML-QDs (10 nm in size). There are deep interface states within the band gap of the BPQDs. The band width fluctuates with changes in the size of the QDs because the QDs are not perfectly circular and have mixed edges. Sousa et al. proposed a theoretical approach to predict the excitonic properties of BPQDs using substrates with different dielectric constants, from strong (SiO2) to weak (Si) dielectric screening.80 Jiang et al. conducted research on the edge states in PQDs using a tight-binding Hamiltonian approach.81 The edge states in PQDs are anisotropically located on only one side. The energy levels of the PQDs could be manipulated by an external electric field and strain, which indicates potential applications in field effect transistors and electromechanical devices. Comparison studies of asymmetrical and symmetrical PQDs are helpful for understanding the shapes and structures of 2D layered QDs.

The color schemes indicate the coordination number of each atom, assuming a cutoff radius of 0.425 nm. (d) The size-dependent single-particle energy spectra of isolated BPQDs.

3.2. Optical properties
Anomalous size-dependence of the optical properties of BPQDs has been found.29 Niu et al. studied the size-dependent electronic, optical absorption and emission properties of BPQDs through time-dependent density functional theory calculations. Both the electronic and absorption gaps follow an inversely proportional law to the sizes of the BPQDs, in conformity with quantum confinement effects. The emission gap is blue-shifted with increasing size, resulting from structure distortion induced by excited-state relaxation. The anomalous size-dependence of emission gaps can lead to an enormous Stokes shift in small BPQDs; however, the Stokes shift ultimately decays to nearly zero, suggesting that large BPQDs are good optical materials. These results facilitate the maximal utilization of BPQDs in optical applications. Scientists have evaluated the photo-absorption tolerance of BPQDs from their intrinsic point defects and oxidation.82 An effective strategy was proposed to eliminate in-gap-states (IGSs) and repair photo-absorption of defective BPQDs via sufficient hydrogen passivation (Fig. 7). BPQDs are defect-tolerant and have excellent photo-absorption when the coordination number (CN) of defective P atoms is 3. Unsaturated or oversaturated P atoms with CN ≠ 3 create IGSs and quench optical absorption. Defect optical tolerance enables BPQDs to serve as promising candidates for electronic and optoelectronic applications. Zhou et al. proposed the transformation of ML BP or blue phosphorus to QDs for photocatalytic solar water splitting.83 Based on first-principles calculations, ML PQDs have tunable energy gaps and work functions. The frontier molecular orbital straddles the redox potentials of water with reasonable oxidization and reduction power, which can enable harvest of the full visible-light spectrum. ML PQDs may be promising candidates as efficient photocatalysts for water splitting.

(c) Absorption spectra of pristine and defective BPQDs. A 0.25 eV of Lorentzian broadening is employed. For defective BPQDs with CN ≠ 3, their absorption intensity is totally quenched and is thus not shown. (Reproduced with permission from ref. 82, Copyright 2017, ACS Publications.) 
In addition to physicochemical properties from theoretical models of BPQDs, the properties of BPQDs have been frequently evaluated experimentally. Jiang et al. studied the tunable broadband nonlinear optical (NLO) properties of BPQDs through femtosecond (fs) laser pulses.56 The BPQDs showed nonlinear absorption in the visible range and saturable absorption in the NIR range under fs excitation. According to fs pump–probe measurements of BPQDs, two-photon absorption is responsible for NLO absorption and saturable absorption is due to ground-state bleaching induced by photo-excitation. Lee et al. reported excitation wavelength-dependent PL of BP-nanodots, which emitted multiple colors (blue, green).55 This phenomenon is highly consistent with other 2D materials-based QDs (graphene, MoS2) and is probably due to polydispersity of the BPQDs. Sun et al. synthesized ultra-small BPQDs with excellent NIR photothermal performance.43 The BPQDs had a broad absorption band spanning the UV to NIR regions, similar to other 2D layered materials (graphene oxide (GO), WS2). According to the Lambert–Beer law (A/L = αC), a linear trend was observed for the dependence of A/L on concentration (C). The extinction coefficient (α) at 808 nm was close to four times larger than that of Au nanorods and GO nanosheets. BPQDs can rapidly and efficiently convert NIR light into thermal energy. Li et al. researched the photodynamic effect of BPQDs and detected 1O2 generation through electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy.45 As confirmed, reactive oxygen species (ROS) were generated from the BPQDs.
3.3. Electronic properties
The electronic properties of rectangular PQDs under an in-plane electric field and perpendicular magnetic field were investigated theoretically.84 Using a tight-binding approach, the energy spectra and wave functions of the PQDs were obtained numerically. The edge states in the band gap of the PQDs are well separated from the bulk states. Due to the presence of well-defined edge states in undoped PQDs, there are different optical transitions between the bulk and edge states. Electric and magnetic fields affect the bulk-to-bulk, edge-to-bulk and edge-to-edge transitions because of the different responses of the bulk and edge states to these fields. The absorption spectra of rectangular PQDs under electric and magnetic fields can be used to identify band gaps and edge states. Zhang et al. reported the electronic and magneto-optical properties of ML PQDs.22 Edge states appear in the band gap of ML (rectangular, hexangular or triangular) PQDs because of anisotropic electron hopping in ML phosphorene. The charge density of any edge state is localized only in specific edges of the ML QDs. The magnetic levels of ML PQDs approach the Landau levels of ML phosphorene when an applied magnetic field increases. A flat band appears in the magneto-energy spectra. The electronic and optical properties can be tuned by the dot sizes, the type of boundary edge and external magnetic fields. In addition, Saroka et al. investigated the electro-optical properties of single-layer PQDs with different shapes, sizes and edge types.85 In phosphorene clusters, many energy edge states are dispersed around the Fermi level. This feature is independent of the edge morphology and roughness. Due to their edge states, the majority of PQDs are metallic and their phosphorene absorption gaps are enriched with low-energy absorption peaks that are tunable by electric fields. Small phosphorene clusters acting as filled materials can be used for electromagnetic shielding. Due to their strong linear dichroism, PQDs are promising materials for infrared polarizers and tunable polarization-sensitive detectors.
In addition to theoretical models of BPQDs, scientists have investigated the electronic properties of BPQDs in experiments. The band energy levels and structures of BPQDs can be tuned by changing their size and thickness. For example, BPQDs may be an ideal additive for organic photovoltaic devices (OPVs).51 The light absorption of BPQDs-based OPVs is enhanced, mainly due to the 2D structure, strong broadband light absorption and scattering of the BPQDs.51 BPQDs were utilized to enhance hole extraction at the anode side of p–i–n planar hybrid perovskite solar cells.50 Small BPQDs have abundant active sites, short lithium diffusion pathways and few mechanical fractures, implying high electrochemical kinetics of the BPQDs.46 Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements illustrated the enhanced catalytic activity of BP NPs through electrode kinetics during hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) operations.54
4. Functionalized modification of BPQDs
BPQDs have various important properties, mainly including physical, chemical, optical, electronic and biomedical. These properties endow BPQDs with a broad range of potential applications, especially bioimaging, fluorescence sensing, cancer therapy, and electronic and optoelectronic devices. Before their potential applications, BPQDs are usually modified with different substances or combined with functionalized substances on their surfaces. These modified and combined BPQDs include BPQDs/nanosheets hybrids, BPQDs-doping films, BPQDs-molecule complexes, polymers-modified BPQDs, and assembly of BPQDs in devices.
4.1. BPQDs/nanosheets hybrids
The synergistic superiority of heterostructures is evidenced by their excellent electrochemical performance in the delivery of reversible capacity. Pan et al. developed a facile strategy for the molecular level distribution of BPQDs on N-graphene nanosheets.46 BPQDs were loaded on N-graphene nanosheets as 2D substrates to prevent aggregation and buffer mechanical stress. The BPQDs/N-graphene heterostructures as a conductive network ensured rapid and reversible electron transport.91 BPQDs as a single-component anode could deliver reversible capacity after repetitive charging–discharging cycles; this may be due to their low electronic conductivity and serious aggregation upon cycling. Wang et al. employed BPQDs to decorate ML MoS2 grown by chemical vapor deposition (CVD).68 Raman and PL spectra of the BPQDs/MoS2 hybrid indicated that the BPQDs are an effective n-type doping scheme for ML MoS2. After decoration by BPQDs, the A1g peak of the MoS2 layer shifted from 404.5 cm−1 to 403.3 cm−1, increasing the half-maximum width. Both the red-shift and peak-broadening of the A1g Raman mode were ascribed to the increased electron concentration in MoS2, similar to the n-type doping of ML MoS2 by other dopants.88,89 The exciton peak of MoS2 shifted from 675 nm to 679 nm and decreased in intensity after BPQDs decoration, indicating a transition from exciton radiation to negatively charged trio-radiation. The electron concentration of MoS2 can be controlled by depositing BPQDs on the MoS2 surface.
4.2. BPQDs-doping films
A BPQDs-doping film was used as a sensing material for an interdigital resistive humidity sensor.44 The BPQDs film was spin-coated on interdigital electrodes within an environment chamber to detect humidity-sensing resistance. The BPQDs film could modulate ionic conduction with humidity changes, showing high performance in humidity sensing. In the autoionization process of water molecules to form mobile H+, the absorbed moisture layer on the surface of the BPQDs film can be ionically conductive. Wang et al. fabricated BPQDs-based composite films.53 BPQDs dispersed in NMP were mixed with polyvinylidene fluoride (PVdF) and ultrasonicated to form a PVdF–BPQDs slurry, which was then casted and punched on aluminum foil. After evaporation treatment, the PVdF–BPQDs composite film was covered on aluminum foil. The drop-casting film was transferred between two fiber connectors serving as fiber-compatible saturable absorbers (SAs). Based on the excellent saturable absorption of the layered BP nanostructures, BPQDs-based SAs can be used in a laser cavity to obtain mode-locked and Q-switched optical pulses. Because of the thickness-dependent bandgap of BP, broadband BPQDs-based SAs can be operated on fiber lasers and solid-state lasers. BPQDs will be developed towards efficient optical SAs for generation of ultra-short pulses in promising ultrafast photonics applications.
4.3. BPQDs-molecules complexes
BP, with its layer-dependent band gap of 0.3 to 2.0 eV, is highly versatile in electronic and optoelectronic applications. BP is very reactive to oxygen and water, which induce compositional and physical changes and degradation of its optical properties. Through surface coordination,90 the sulfonic ester of a titanium ligand (TiL4) was coordinated with BPQDs.58 The TiL4-coordinated BPQDs acted as photoacoustic imaging (PAI) agents for in vivo bioimaging. BP degradation can be initiated by an oxidation reaction. The lone pair electrons of BP are occupied by ambient oxygen to form PxOy; they are deprived of oxygen by electrophilic TiL4. The reaction between BP and ambient oxygen can be efficiently prevented. The coordination of TiL4 can enhance the colloidal and photochemical stability of BPQDs dispersed in water. Gu et al. constructed a ratiometric fluorescence sensor based on a complex of BPQDs and tetraphenylporphyrin tetrasulfonic acid (TPPS).47 The fluorescence of the BPQDs was quenched by TPPS via the inner filter effect (IFE). Hg2+ accelerated the coordination of Mn2+ with TPPS to form a Mn2+–TPPS complex, inducing blue-green fluorescence recovery of BPQDs and red fluorescence reduction of TPPS. An IFE between BPQDs and 2-nitro-5-thiobenzoate anion (TNB) was reported.61 5,5′-Dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) reacted with thiols to form TNB. The BPQDs/DTNB complex was used for fluorescence detection of thiols through IFE.
4.4. Polymers-modified BPQDs
PEG has high biocompatibility and often serves as a superior polymer stabilizer of nanomaterials for biomedical applications. Thus, BPQDs are combined with PEG to improve their stability in physiological media. Sun et al. reported the surface modifications of BPQDs with PEG.43 BPQDs are soluble in water, but they aggregate in salt solution. Positively charged PEG–NH2 was used to coat the surface of BPQDs via electrostatic adsorption. The PEG-modified BPQDs exhibited enhanced stability in physiological solutions, such as phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and cell-culture media, without observable toxicity to different types of cells. The BPQDs were combined with PEG chains to achieve improved biocompatibility and physiological stability.45 By conjugation with PEG, the PEGylated BPQDs retained high photothermal conversion performance and low degradation after incubation in aqueous solution for 48 h. After grafting with rhodamine B (RdB), RdB/PEG-BPQDs had superior PL properties for potential bioimaging. Water-soluble PEGylated BP NPs with excellent biocompatibility were prepared and shown to be suitable for significant photothermal ablation treatment of cancer under NIR light irradiation.60
Additionally, other polymers have been employed as stabilizing or coating reagents of BPQDs. For example, PLGA loaded with BPQDs was processed by an emulsion method to generate biodegradable BPQDs/PLGA nanospheres.59 The hydrophobic PLGA isolates the interior BPQDs from oxygen and water to enhance their photothermal stability and can efficiently control the degradation rate of BPQDs. The BPQDs/PLGA nanospheres demonstrated low toxicity, high biocompatibility, photothermal therapy (PTT) efficiency and tumor targeting ability for potential clinical applications. BPQDs were functionalized with poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH) to develop a BP-QDs@PAH complex.48 The core–shelled complex with superior transfection efficiency and negligible cytoxicity can be used as a smart gene delivery system for efficient delivery of small interfering RNA (siRNA) into cancer cells, showing synergistic photothermal effects. Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) as a polymer matrix was mixed with BPQDs to form a BPQDs-PVP complex that was used as an active layer in BPQDs-based memory devices, with a structure of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET)/Au/BPQDs-PVP/Ag.42 The suspension of BPQDs in NMP was mixed with PVdF powder and ultrasonicated to form a PVdF–BPQDs slurry.53
4.5. Assembly of BPQDs
Self-assembly of simple building blocks into complex super-structures is significant for engineering materials with enhanced and synergistic properties. BPQDs were hierarchically self-assembled into paper-like membranes in the centimeter range.72 The self-assembly process has two major stages: aggregation driven by Brownian motion and an interfacial self-concentrating process via capillary interactions. A marked blue-shift in the absorption band edge of the BPQDs indicates the quantum confinement effect of electrons in the BPQDs. All modes in the Raman spectra shifted to lower frequencies. The dramatic broadening compared with pristine bulk BP suggests the photon confinement effect of the BPQDs. OPVs were designed based on polythieno[3,4-b]-thiophene:benzodithiophene:[6,6]-phenyl C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PTB7:PC71BM) containing BPQDs (∼4.5 nm) at different concentrations.51 OPVs with cascade band structures were fabricated by a solution process on indium tin oxide (ITO) glass substrates. The cascade band structures formed in ternary devices benefit efficient carrier separation, but prohibit carrier recombination. The processed BPQDs were utilized to enhance hole extraction at the anode side of p–i–n planar hybrid perovskite solar cells (HPSCs) with improved photon conversion efficacies.50 BPQDs inserted between the perovskite and PEDOT:PSS layers were used as a perovskite absorber layer to explore hole extraction enhancement.
BP NPs were utilized as electrocatalytic tags in a competitive immunoassay for rabbit immunoglobulin G (IgG).54 Tosyl-activated paramagnetic beads (MBs) were conjugated with anti-rabbit IgG. In parallel, rabbit IgG was labeled with BP NPs. This complex was conjugated with MBs/anti-rabbit IgG in the presence of free rabbit IgG at the desired concentrations to perform a competitive magneto-immunoassay. The detection signal was produced from the nanoimpacts of BP NPs followed by HER catalysis. Additionally, 3D illustration and fabrication of BPQD-based resistive random access memory (RRAM) was reported.49 The device began with 100 nm aluminum (Al) patterned on PET flexible substrates as parallel bottom electrodes. Briefly, a poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) layer was deposited on the substrates via a spin-coating technique. The suspension of BPQDs was dispensed on the PMMA layers in a self-assembly process, followed by blowing the suspension away with a rubber suction bulb in one direction. After the self-assembled BPQD layer was complete, a PMMA layer was spin-coated to form resistive switching materials with sandwich structures. The crossbar array architecture was designed by depositing top Al electrodes on the active layers. BPQD-based RRAM exhibited promising applications in flexible electronic devices. PQDs were coupled with a microfiber evanescent light field to form a PQDs-based SA device.57 BPQDs-based optical SA was developed.74 By transferring a PVdF–BPQDs composite film between two fiber connectors, self-starting mode-locked operations could be obtained.
5. Applications of BPQDs
Since the first report on liquid-phase ultrasonic preparation of BPQDs in 2015,42 various synthetic methods of BPQDs have been explored in succession using bulk BP crystals or powders as precursors (Table 1). The synthesized BPQDs exhibit superior optical, electronic and other physicochemical properties, implying significant potential applications. When BPQDs are functionalized (modified, combined) with other functional substances, the resulting BPQDs-based complexes and hybrid systems can be widely applied to currently active research fields, such as bioimaging, fluorescence sensing, nonlinear optical absorbers, cancer therapy, intelligent electronic elements, photovoltaics, optoelectronics and flexible devices (Table 2). We will systematically summarize the potential applications of BPQDs and highlight their mechanisms, current status, challenges and future prospects.
5.1. Bioimaging

5.1.1. Fluorescence imaging. 
BP-nanodots show low cytotoxicity in vitro, and blue-green fluorescence emission was observed in HeLa cells.55In vivo cytotoxicity assays indicated the potential of BP-nanodots as biocompatible biomedical fluorescence agents. Upon uptake of BP-nanodots into HeLa cells, blue and green fluorescence in the cells were observed under UV and visible light excitation to provide multiple colors (Fig. 8). BP-nanodots can be used in biomedical applications (cellular tracking, drug delivery) as blue-emitting and green-emitting bioimaging probes. Yin et al. detected red fluorescence (Cy3) signals in PA-1 cells treated with BP-QD@PAH/LSD1 siRNACy3.48 The fluorescence microscopy images of BP-QD complex in PA-1 cells only arose from the organic dye Cy3. The BP-QDs served as a gene delivery system, not a fluorescence imaging agent. Li et al. explored RdB/PEG-BPQDs for cancer cell imaging.45 In confocal microscope images, an obvious fluorescence signal (RdB) was found in Hep G2 (4T1) cells incubated with RdB/PEG-BPQDs. The BPQDs were located almost entirely in the cytoplasm. No fluorescence was found in cancer cells without BPQDs, implying the potential of the PEG-BPQDs as a bioimaging platform.

5.1.2. Photoacoustic imaging. 
As a new bioimaging modality, photoacoustic imaging (PAI) addresses the drawbacks of ultrasound imaging (speckle artefacts) and optical imaging (limited penetration depth) and also integrates their merits. PAI can obtain high spatial-resolution images with an optical contrast up to a depth of 5 to 6 cm in biological tissues and provide inherent background-free detection. Sun et al. studied the in vitro PAI performance of PEGylated BP NPs using a multispectral optoacoustic tomography system.60 The PAI signal is linearly dependent on the NP concentration (upper frame in Fig. 9). Pre-contrast images show weak signals in liver, kidney and tumor tissue. As shown in PAI in vivo images from tumor-bearing mice injected with NPs, the contrasts in the liver, kidney and tumor regions were enhanced with increasing circulation time, revealing gradual accumulation of BP NPs in these organs. 24 h after injection, the higher intensity in the tumor region than in the liver and kidney regions indicated that more BP NPs remained in the tumor. The PEGylated BP NPs exhibited long retention times in tumors and could be readily excreted from the liver and kidneys. The TiL4@BPQDs showed excellent in vitro/in vivo PAI efficacies in MCF cancer cells and Balb/C-nude mice.58 The superior sensitivity and high spatial resolution in tumors suggested significant clinical applications of TiL4@BPQDs. The PAI signal in tumor sites is very low in the early stage; however, an effective exogenous contrast (BPQDs) is desirable for in vivo PAI of tumor locations. PTT is a minimally invasive therapeutic approach using NIR light-absorbing agents to convert photons into heat for cancer cell ablation. The combination of PTT with PAI can provide perfect resolution for accurate diagnosis and treatment of cancer. Both PTT and PAI utilize NIR-absorbing materials as theranostic agents.58,60 BPQDs with the capability to convert NIR light into heat can serve as superior nanotheranostic agents for simultaneous PAI and PTT of cancer.

5.1.3. Thermal imaging. 
In addition to fluorescence imaging and PAI, BPQDs have been applied to in vivo thermal imaging. To monitor the in vivo photothermal effects of PEGylated BP NPs, temperature changes in tumor areas were recorded by a thermal imaging apparatus.60 When tumor-bearing mice intratumorally injected with NPs solution were exposed to 808 nm laser light (2.0 W cm−2), the tumor temperature increased from 34 °C to 59 °C within 5 min. Zhu et al. investigated NIR thermal images of BPQDs solution under different irradiation periods with an 808 nm laser (1.5 W cm−2).44 Based on photothermal heating curves from NIR thermal images, the BPQDs solution temperature increased from 18.3 °C to 50.1 °C within 7 min. To monitor the photothermal effects in vivo, infrared thermographic maps and temperature changes in the tumors were recorded by an infrared thermal imaging camera (Fig. 10).59 The tumor temperature of mice injected with BPQDs/PLGA NSs increased by 26.3 °C within 10 min of NIR laser irradiation and reached 58.8 °C, which is a high enough temperature for tumor ablation. The tumors shrank gradually and were obliterated, leaving black scars, and were completely cured in 16 days. In vivo thermal imaging facilitates high-resolution and real-time evaluation of BPQD/PLGA NSs in PTT of cancer.

5.2. Fluorescence sensing
The excitation wavelength-dependent PL of BP-nanodots was confirmed; they emitted multiple colors (blue, green).55 PL spectra of BP-nanodots (10 nm average width, 8.7 nm in height) were recorded under excitation at 290 to 450 nm. Strong emission peaks were located at 394 to 516 nm, with a maximum quantum yield of 7.2%. After 7 days, the PL intensity decreased to at least half of the initial level due to degradation of the BP-nanodots in aqueous solution, implying partial ionization of the BP-nanodots to PxOy (e.g. phosphates or phosphonates). Surface passivation is highly necessary for high biocompatibility, PL stability and quantum yield of BP-nanodots for biomedical applications (bioimaging, cellular tracking). Gu et al. synthesized BPQDs exhibiting green fluorescence with 8.4% quantum yield, high photostability and pH resistance.61 The BPQDs had an absorption peak around 350 nm, and the emission peak was red-shifted from 491 nm to 521 nm with increasing excitation wavelength. The PL characteristic may result from the polydispersity of the BPQDs, which is consistent with other 2D layered nanomaterials-based (graphene, MoS2) QDs.
Based on theoretical calculations, the emission peaks of BPQDs are red-shifted with increasing size from 1.8 nm to 3.8 nm. However, the trend is reversed because the emission peaks are blue-shifted for QDs with smaller sizes of 0.8 to 1.8 nm. The anomalous size-dependent luminescence of smaller BPQDs is due to competition between quantum confinement effects and the structure distortion of excited-state relaxation. For larger BPQDs, the red-shifted emission with increasing size is attributed to quantum confinement effects. After 2 h irradiation with UV light (365 nm), the fluorescence intensity of the BPQDs is almost constant, implying superior photostability. The BPQDs have high pH resistance. Under neutral or weak alkaline conditions, the fluorescence intensity is almost unchanged. Ge et al. reported excitation wavelength-independent PL emission of PQDs obtained by pulsed laser ablation because of the insensitivity of the passivated QDs to quantum size effects.76 The PL emission peak positions of PQDs were not red-shifted with progressively longer excitation wavelengths. The saturated passivation on the periphery and surface of the PQDs by large numbers of electron-donating functional groups resulted in a dramatic increase of electron density on the PQDs and band gap insensitivity to quantum size effects in the PQDs. Intense and stable PL emission of the PQDs in the blue to violet region was observed and was mainly attributed to electronic transitions from the LUMO to the HOMO and the occupied molecular orbital below the HOMO. Excitation-independent emission of PQDs should be further explored as semiconductor-based blue-violet light irradiation sources.
A ratiometric fluorescence mode for Hg2+ sensing was developed using BPQDs as a fluorescence probe.47 The sensing was based on IFE between TPPS and the BPQDs due to the overlap between the excitation spectrum of the BPQDs and the absorption spectrum of the TPPS. The fluorescence of the BPQDs was quenched by TPPS via IFE. Hg2+ could accelerate the coordination of Mn2+ with TPPS. The Mn2+–TPPS complex led to decreased absorption intensity of TPPS, recovered blue-green (523 nm) fluorescence of the BPQDs and decreased red (649 nm) fluorescence of TPPS. There is a good (R2 = 0.983) linear relationship between the intensity ratio (I523/I649) and the Hg2+ concentration (1 to 60 nM), with a detection limit of 0.39 nM. BPQDs were used as a fluorescence probe for thiol detection based on IFE.61 Versatile and water-soluble DTNB is suitable for quantitating free thiol groups through visible absorption. DTNB was used to construct an IFE-based fluorescence sensor to detect thiol-containing molecules (Fig. 11). DTNB reacted with thiol groups to generate TNB. TNB has a considerable spectral overlap with the excitation spectrum of the BPQDs, leading to fluorescence quenching of the BPQDs. A fluorescence sensing platform for sensitive detection of thiols (glutathione, L-cysteine, or L-homocysteine) was developed by IFE between BPQDs and TNB. A BPQDs-based platform was used to assess the activity of acetyl-cholinesterase (AChE). Produced from AChE-catalyzed hydrolysis of acetylthiocholine (ATCh), thiocholine (Tch) reacted with DTNB to form TNB, which quenched the fluorescence of the BPQDs. The probe had a linear detection range of 0.2 to 5 unit L−1 of ATCh and a low detection limit of 0.04 unit L−1.

The inset is the linear plot of fluorescence intensity versus AChE activity over the range from 0.2 to 5 unit L−1.

5.3. Cancer therapy

5.3.1. Photothermal therapy. 
BPQDs have a broad absorption band that spans the UV to NIR regions. Ultra-small BPQDs can rapidly convert NIR light into thermal energy and had excellent NIR photothermal performance, with a high conversion efficiency of up to 28.4%.43 The extinction coefficient at 808 nm was 14.8 L g−1 cm−1. The photothermal effects of BPQDs did not deteriorate with increasing temperature, implying their potential as photothermal agents. In addition, Shao et al. investigated biodegradable BPQDs/poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanospheres.59 The temperature of the BPQDs/PLGA solution increased by 19.9 °C after 808 nm laser irradiation (1.0 W cm−2) for 10 min. The biodegradable nature of PLGA in water led to exposure of the BPQDs to water molecules. About 10% loss in absorbance and photothermal performance was observed. Because PLGA hardly degrades in air, BPQDs/PLGA can be stored as a powder for at least 3 months. Li et al. evaluated the photothermal effects of PEGylated BPQDs.45 When a BPQDs aqueous solution was exposed to an 808 nm laser irradiation for 10 min, the solution temperature increased by 30.5 °C. High photothermal stability of the PEGylated BPQDs was observed in five laser on–off cycles. The PEGylated BP NPs had excellent photostability and could efficiently convert NIR light into heat.60 The BP NPs presented a broad absorption band across the UV-vis-NIR regions. The small extinction coefficient of 2.1 L g−1 cm−1 may be due to partial oxidation of the BP NPs. Zhu et al. investigated the photothermal properties of BPQDs.44 The temperature of a BPQDs dispersion solution increased from 18.3 °C to 50.1 °C upon laser irradiation at 808 nm (1.5 W cm−2) for 7 min. Their broad spectrum absorption, high photothermal converting effects and stability indicate the potential of BPQDs (NPs) as promising nanoagents for cancer treatment.
The photothermal effects of PEG-modified BPQDs were studied in glioma cells (C6) and breast cancer cells (MCF7).43 After incubation with BPQDs for 4 h, C6 and MCF7 cells were illuminated with an 808 nm NIR laser (1.0 W cm−2) for 10 min. A BPQD-dose-dependent PTT effect was observed for these cells. Live and dead cells were differentiated by calcein AM (live cells with green fluorescence) and propidium iodide (PI: dead cells with red fluorescence). Almost all cells were killed after incubation with 50 ppm of BPQDs under NIR laser. In the absence of BPQDs, the exposure of cells to NIR laser did not restrain cell viability (Fig. 12). The standard methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay revealed ultralow toxicity to cancer cells incubated with 20 to 200 ppm of BPQDs. The enhanced cancer cell death can be attributed to the high PTT efficiency of the BPQDs. The ultra-small size of the BPQDs promotes their internalization in cancer cells. During long blood circulation time, the BPQDs could efficiently attach to non-immunogenic and cellular targeting molecules for targeted PTT of cancer.95,96

A high PTT efficiency of BPQDs/PLGA nanospheres (NSs) was evidenced based on efficient tumour ablation under NIR laser illumination.59 After incubation with NSs for 4 h, MCF7 and B16 (melanoma) cells were irradiated with an 808 nm laser (1 W cm−2) for 10 min. Cell viability was assessed by a cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay. A dose-dependent PTT effect was observed. Upon exposure to a NIR laser, almost all cancer cells were killed after incubation with NSs containing 10 ppm of BPQDs; this confirmed the high PTT efficiency of BPQDs/PLGA NSs in sterilizing cancer cells. No dark cytotoxicity from the CCK-8 assay could be observed when human hepatocellular carcinoma (Hep G2) cells were incubated with PEGylated BPQDs, even at a concentration up to 100 μg mL−1.45 The viability of Hep G2 cells displayed a decreasing trend upon 808 nm laser irradiation, indicating an obvious PTT effect. Under NIR light irradiation, the complex of BP nanodots and LSD1 (lysine-specific demethylase) siRNA inhibited the growth rate of PA-1 (human ovarian teratocarcinoma) cells over 80%.48 The strong inhibition rate should be attributed to the excellent PTT performance of BP nanodots under NIR laser irradiation.
Using PEGylated BP NPs as photosensitizers, in vivo PTT of cancer was conducted on 4T1 (murine breast cancer) tumor-bearing mice.60 The mice were intratumorally injected with a solution of NPs and exposed to an 808 nm laser (2.0 W cm−2). The tumor temperature increased from 34 °C to 59 °C within 5 min (Fig. 13). The phototherapeutic efficacy of the NPs was further studied. For mice treated with both NPs and laser irradiation, the solid tumors shrank gradually and were scabbed after treatment for 3 days. The tumors of mice treated with either NPs or laser irradiation at the same power density grew with increasing culture time. The mice in the treated groups were tumor-free after treatment and survived for over 42 days with only one death until they were sacrificed. The mice in the control groups had an average lifespan of 18 to 32 days, indicating the merits of PEGylated BP NPs for in vivo PTT of cancer. The major organs of the mice were sliced and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) for histology analysis to evaluate the therapy efficacy and in vivo toxicity of PEGylated BP NPs. The organs of mice in control groups demonstrated aggressive metastases, especially in the liver and lungs, compared with healthy mice. The treated mice sacrificed after PTT with NPs had no significant damage to normal tissues (heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney), demonstrating that the PTT treatment with BP NPs had no effect on normal tissues.

5.3.2. Photodynamic therapy. 
In addition to PTT, BP nanosheets can serve as biodegradable photosensitizers for 1O2 generation in tumor photodynamic therapy (PDT).86 Usually, particles smaller than 10 nm can be effectively eliminated from the kidneys and liver. Li et al. prepared ultra-small PEGylated BPQDs with excellent 1O2 generation capability.45 They studied the photodynamic effects of the BPQDs and detected 1O2 generation via ESR spectroscopy. 2,2,6,6-Tetra-methylpiperidine (TEMP) was utilized as the 1O2 trapping agent. In the ESR spectra, a characteristic signal induced by 1O2 was observed under irradiation, revealing 1O2 generation. No other ROS signals could be detected. 5,5-Dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO, as a spin trap agent) was utilized to exclude other reactive oxygen species (ROS). The detected ROS may have been generated from the BPQDs. 1,3-Diphenyliso-benzofuran (DPBF) reacted with 1O2, which led to decreased absorption intensity at ∼410 nm. With increasing irradiation time with 625 nm light, the absorption intensity of DPBF showed a continuous decrease at 410 nm, implying a photosensitive reaction induced by the BPQDs. No changes were observed in the absorption spectra upon exposure to NaN3 (scavenger of 1O2) or 808 nm laser irradiation, confirming 1O2 generation under NIR-light irradiation. Luminescence spectra of 1O2 induced by PEGylated BPQDs were acquired to evaluate the quantum yield of 1O2. Based on the standard value from rose bengal (RB, ΦRB = 0.86 in ethanol), the 1O2 quantum yield of PEGylated BPQDs was measured to be about 0.74, which is higher than that of most previous photosensitizers.87
In addition to PTT effects, BPQDs have potential for use in PDT. In PDT, cancer cells can be killed by cytotoxic ROS generated from endocytosed photosensitizers under irradiation conditions.97 Due to the severe hypoxia environment in tumors, PDT efficacy is limited by low 1O2 production. The combination of PDT with PTT has been proposed to overcome this disadvantage. Heat induced by PTT can significantly improve blood flow, increase oxygen supply and enhance 1O2 production. PDT enhances the sensitivity of tumor cells to PTT by disturbing their micro-environmental conditions. Therefore, the combination of PTT with PDT may be an effective therapeutic strategy to treat superficially located tumors. Li et al. performed CCK-8 assays to determine the cytotoxicity of PEGylated BPQDs to Hep G2 cells.45 The viability of Hep G2 cells incubated with QDs and subjected to 625 nm light (for PDT) or 808 nm laser (for PTT) irradiation decreased with increasing concentration of the QDs. According to an ROS assay kit, the PEGylated BPQDs could generate 1O2 in live Hep G2 cells upon 625 nm light irradiation. The cell death rate in the PTT–PDT combined group was higher than that in the separate treatment groups, implying synergistic effects from BPQDs-based combination therapy.98 PEGylated BPQDs with ultralow cytotoxicity may be superior photosensitizers to classic Ce6.94


5.3.3. Toxicity evaluation. 
Before biomedical application, the biocompatibility of BPQDs should be studied. BPQDs are usually functionalized with biocompatible or biodegradable molecules and polymers (PEG, PLGA, PAH). High biocompatibility of the functionalized BPQDs is expected and is beneficial to high therapeutic efficacy in clinical applications. The in vivo toxicology of BPQDs/PLGA NSs was investigated.59 Based on haematological data of mice intravenously injected with NSs at 1, 7 and 28 days postinjection, the NSs did not cause obvious infection or inflammation in treated mice. Blood biochemical analysis suggested that the NSs induced no obvious hepatic or kidney toxicity in mice. Histological changes in the major organs were checked by immunohistochemistry. No noticeable signal of organ damage was observable during the whole treatment period from all groups, indicating no remarkable histological abnormality or lesion in the NSs-treated groups at the tested doses. Inappreciable toxicity was observed for the BPQDs/PLGA NSs, regardless of NIR laser irradiation. Even when the NSs-treated mice were maintained under artificial daylight illumination for 24 h, no distinct toxic effect was found. Moreover, the lack of evident phototoxicity induced by the NSs further indicated their high biocompatibility.
Mu et al. evaluated the toxicity and oxidative stress of BPQDs at the cell, tissue and whole-body levels.45In vitro cell assays revealed that BPQDs could generate an appreciable amount of ROS, resulting in cell apoptosis. BPQDs at a concentration up to 200 μg mL−1 had significant apoptotic effects on HeLa cells. Oxidative stress (lipid peroxidation, reduction of catalase activity, DNA breaking and bone marrow nucleated cell damage) could be induced transiently by BPQDs but recovered gradually to healthy levels. No apparent pathological damage was observed in organs, especially in the spleen and kidneys, during a 30-day period. BPQDs caused acute toxicities by oxidative stress responses; however, the inflammatory reaction could be recovered as the time extended to 30 days. Based on hematological, biochemical and pathological analysis, BPQDs cannot induce long-term inflammatory or appreciable toxicological responses, revealing neglectful damage in vivo.


5.3.4. Biodistribution in vivo. 
The in vivo biodistribution of BPQDs has been evaluated.59 Balb/c nude mice bearing MCF7 breast tumors were intravenously injected with Cy5.5-labeled BPQDs/PLGA NSs for biodistribution analysis. The pharmacokinetics profiles of the NSs were studied by fluorometry to determine their concentrations in blood at different time intervals post-injection (in Fig. 14). The pharmacokinetics obeyed a two-compartment model, as shown in the fitted curve. The NSs in blood circulation exhibited a long second phase (elimination phase), acting as the predominant process for NSs clearance. A long blood circulation of NSs delayed macrophage clearance in the reticuloendothelial system, promoting enhanced tumor targeting by enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effects. The biodistribution of NSs in mice was observed by fluorescence imaging. Clearly, intense fluorescence at subcutaneous tumors could be delineated from other tissues. After 48 post-injection, the tumors still maintained strong fluorescence, indicating high retention of NSs in the tumors. Bright fluorescence from ex vivo images after 24 h post-injection could be observed in tumors and organs, including the liver, spleen and kidneys. Micro-organizational examination of the tumors (∼50 mm2) showed that the NSs were distributed throughout the entire tumor sections. Significant colocalization of nuclei (blue, DAPI staining) and NSs (red) in the tumor sections proved the efficient penetration of NSs within the tumors. After 24 post-injection, large NSs concentrations were found in tumors and organs, including the liver, spleen and kidneys. The uptake of NSs by the liver and spleen can be attributed to reticuloendothelial system absorption, while kidney uptake is associated with possible renal excretion. Considerable uptake by the tumors was achieved because of EPR effects. After 7 days post-injection, the residual ratio of the NSs decreased to 29.9% ID g−1, probably indicating partial metabolism of the NSs. The biodegradability of the NSs enabled harmless clearance of the NSs from the body in a reasonable period of time, even several months.

5.4. Nonlinear optical absorbers
The tunable broadband NLO properties of BPQDs under fs laser pulses have been researched.56 BPQDs demonstrated nonlinear absorption in the visible range and saturable absorption in the NIR range upon fs excitation. Using an open-aperture Z-scan technique, the calculated NLO absorption coefficients were 7.49, 1.68, and 0.81 (× 10−3 cm GW−1) at 500, 700 and 900 nm, respectively. As revealed in fs pump–probe measurements of the BPQDs, two-photon absorption is responsible for the NLO absorption. Saturable absorption characteristics at 1050 nm, 1350 nm and 1550 nm are ascribed to ground-state bleaching induced by photo-excitation. The BPQDs can be used as broadband optical limiters in the visible range or as SA in the NIR range for ultrafast laser pulses. Ultra-small BPQDs can serve as useful broadband optical elements in ultrafast photonics devices. Du et al. fabricated PQDs-based SA for ultrafast fiber lasers.57 By coupling the PQDs with a microfiber evanescent light field, the PQDs-based SA device demonstrated ultrafast nonlinear saturable absorption together with an optical modulation depth of 8.1% at the telecommunication band. Ultra-small PQDs with NLO properties exhibit significant applications in ultrafast photonic technologies.
Through fs laser Z-scan measurements, ultra-small BPQDs (∼2.1) exhibited excellent NLO responses, with a modulation depth of ∼36% and a saturable intensity of ∼3.3 GW cm−2.74 BPQDs-based optical SA was designed and enabled the generation of ultra-short pulses at 1567.5 nm in an Er-doped fiber laser. BPQDs can be developed as good candidates for ultrafast photonics devices. Chen et al. evaluated broadband the ultrafast nonlinear absorption and ultra-long exciton relaxation of BPQDs.73 In addition to saturation absorption, two-photon absorption was observed in the BPQDs. The BPQDs showed different excitation intensities and wavelength-dependent NLO responses from BP nanosheets because of quantum confinement effects and edge effects. The BPQDs showed broadband photon-induced absorption under probe wavelengths from 470 nm to 850 nm. Substantial independence (in ultra-long time scales) of the pump intensity and temperature revealed that the carrier recombination mechanism can be attributed to a defect-assisted Auger capture process. These findings will be helpful for developing optoelectronic and photonic devices operating in the infrared and visible wavelength regions. Gao et al. verified the broadband NLO responses of BPQDs.69 The superior broadband nonlinear saturable absorption of BPQDs is highly promising for NLO applications. Laser photolysis measurements suggested that the nonlinear response originated due to long-lived electron–hole pairs delocalized within the BPQDs. These results further elucidated the mechanism of nonlinear saturable absorption and provided new insight into the increase of third-order optical responses through hybridizing with other nonlinear materials. These results will promote further development of 2D BP nanomaterials for future nonlinear ultrafast photonics and laser beam shaping applications.
5.5. Intelligent electronic elements
BPQDs have high humidity sensing capacity.44 A BPQDs film was spin-coated on interdigital electrodes and tested within an environment chamber to detect humidity sensing resistance (Fig. 15). The sensor resistance decreased by ∼4 orders of magnitude with varying relative humidity (RH) from 10% to 90%. For the BPQDs film, the modulation in ionic conduction with humidity changes is responsible for the high performance of the BPQDs-based humidity sensor. Due to the autoionization process of water molecules to form mobile H+, the absorbed moisture layer on the surface of the BPQDs film can be ionically conductive. Upon exposure to water molecules and oxygen, BP is readily oxidized to phosphorus oxides or phosphoric acid and further ionically dissolved in moist media, thereby enhancing the H+ concentration. The resistance decreased by over 1300 times as the RH increased from 15% to 90%, higher than that of a BP nanosheet film.101,102 The response characteristics of the BPQDs-based humidity sensing changed slightly after 66 h exposure and operation in high humidity levels. This humidity sensor had high sensitivity and stability. BP NPs have been developed for use in vapour sensing, utilizing impedance spectroscopy and BP NPs-modified interdigital electrodes.75 Dry air saturated with methanol vapor at 20 °C was used for testing. The detection limit of methanol vapor was below 2500 ppm (v/v), with a clearly visible phase peak at 4 kHz. The presence of hydroxyl groups may play an important role in its interactions with the BP surface, influencing its impedance at different frequencies. The detection abilities were related to the magnitude of the dielectric constant (32.7 for methanol) and the chemical composition. BP NPs-based gas sensing from impedance measurements suggested high sensitivity to methanol. BP NPs may find broad applications from biocompatible molecule tags to semiconductor devices.103–106

5.6. Photovoltaic devices
BPQDs as additives were introduced in OPVs and used to enhance light harvesting.51 By adding 0.055 wt% of BPQDs relative to the polymer donors in OPVs, the efficacy of a device was improved by over 10%. The weight percentage was lower than other additives used in OPVs, which is mainly attributed to the 2D structure, strong broadband light absorption and scattering of BPQDs.99 This work provides a cost-effective way to improve the device efficacy of 2D QDs-based OPVs and can open a window for integrating various novel 2D materials in solution-processed next-generation photovoltaic devices. BPQDs have been used in hole extraction of typical planar HPSCs.50 Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite (CH3NH3PbI3) served as a photon absorber. PEDOT:PSS and ZrAcAc-modified PC61BM served as hole and electron transport layers (Fig. 16). BPQDs inserted between perovskite and PEDOT:PSS layers were used to explore enhanced hole extraction for perovskite absorber layers. The photon conversion efficiency was ramped from 14.10% to 16.69% with increased coating count of BPQDs. The short current density (Jsc) of the PEDOT/BPQD3 device, integrated from external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra, was ∼20.13 mA cm−2. The average efficacy shifted from 13.13% for the reference to 15.26% for the PEDOT/BPQD3-based devices, revealing high reproducibility of the HPSCs and high performance of the BPQDs as a hole extraction interlayer. According to their high hole mobility and suitable energy band levels, BPQDs have excellent hole extraction effects and show potential in photovoltaic and optoelectronic applications.

The molecular level distribution of BPQDs on N-doped graphene nanosheets was evaluated for superior lithium storage.46 BPQDs/N-graphene (van der Waals) heterostructures as a conductive network could ensure rapid and reversible electron transfer and superior electrochemical performance, delivering a high reversible capacity of 1271 mA h g−1 at 500 mA g−1. Small sizes of BPQDs translate into abundant active sites, short lithium diffusion pathways and few mechanical fractures, revealing high electrochemical kinetics. BPQDs in heterostructures prevent their aggregation upon cycling, preserving the whole structure, enabling high stability and buffering mechanical stress. This work provides a new route to address the capacity deficiency that has restrained the progress of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) towards use in large power tools. BP NPs-based labels were designed for immunoassays via HER mediation.54 The BP NPs enhanced the catalytic effects on HER and exhibited higher electrocatalytic activity and lower electron transfer resistance compared with BP NPs. Especially, detection of IgG concentration was performed by electrocatalysis of the BP NPs via HER (proton reduction). The detection signal was produced by the nanoimpact of BP NPs, followed by HER catalysis.
5.7. Optoelectronics
BPQDs can be potentially applied to broadband optical limiters in the visible range and SAs in the NIR range for ultrafast laser pulses. Ultra-small BPQDs can be explored as broadband optical elements in ultrafast photonics devices. PQDs were deposited on microfiber to form an SA device, exhibiting strong nonlinear saturable absorption for ultrafast laser cavities through evanescent field interactions.57 In view of PQDs-based SAs, a self-starting mode-locked Er-doped fiber laser for ultra-short pulse generation was developed. A polarization-locked vector soliton was observed. By extending BP to other 2D layered materials with potential ultrafast photonic applications, this study will benefit future short-pulse fiber laser technologies.100 An Er-doped fiber laser was passively mode-locked by a BPQDs-based SA.53 The SA showed a fiber-compatible sandwich structure with the BPQDs composite film, generated by drop-casting of a BPQDs dispersion. This work implies that the BPQDs-SA enables effective generation of ultrafast bound solitons.

Fig. 17 illustrates the fabrication of the BPQDs-based SA. A PVdF–BPQDs composite film on Al foil was treated by evaporation.74 The SA was fabricated by transferring the film between two fiber connectors. Self-starting mode-locked operation was performed at a pump power of 50 mW by placing the BPQDs-based SA inside fiber laser cavities. The clear sidebands indicate the output pulse with the soliton pulse. The oscilloscope trace of the output pulse-train possesses a pulse-to-pulse interval of 65.7 ns, indicating long range stability. The autocorrection trace of mode-locked pulses with a 1.67 ps pulse duration suggests a real pulse duration of 1.08 ps. The time-bandwidth product is 0.316. The radio frequency spectrum of lasers shows a repetition of 15.25 MHz, consisting of a cavity length of 13.11 m. The noise ratio of the electrical signal at 15.25 MHz is ca. 64.3 dB, measured with a resolution bandwidth of 10 Hz. Due to the superior NLO properties of BPQDs, the BPQDs-based optical SA can deliver generation of ultra-short pulses at 1567.5 nm in Er-doped fiber lasers. BPQDs are good candidates for application in ultrafast photoelectronic devices.

5.8. Flexible devices
Flexible technology allows the manufacture of flexible displays, artificial skins and flexible electronics. Flexible sensors act as important components of smart portable devices and have been used in targeted healthcare, environment monitoring, point-of-care diagnostics and personal electronics. The fabrication process mainly involves the coating of active materials on flexible substrates. Fully flexible platforms have excellent mechanical strength, controllable wettability and good functionality.107,108 BPQDs–PVP was used as an active layer in a flexible memory device based on PET/Au/BPQDs–PVP/Ag (Fig. 18).42 The smart device showed electrically bistable behavior. When the applied negative voltage was increased, the current increased rapidly, revealing a transition of the electrical properties from a high-resistance state (HRS, OFF) to a low-resistance state (LRS, ON). The transition from the HRS to the LRS is equivalent to the writing process in digital memory devices. The high stability in the LRS during subsequent voltage and positive sweeps indicates nonvolatile memory effects. The HRS is recovered by applying a reverse voltage, equivalent to the erasing process of digital memory devices. The LRS is retained without voltage during cycles; however, a suitable positive voltage switches the LRS to the HRS. These features indicate that BPQDs-PVP is an electrically bistable material for flash memory devices. The high ON–OFF current ratio provides a low misreading rate during device operations. There was no obvious fluctuation in retention-time assays after 1.1 × 103 s of testing under ambient conditions at a reading voltage of 0.2 V, indicating high stability. Experimental data from I–V curves were employed to explain the carrier transport mechanism of the device. The BPQDs-PVP based flexible memory device had flash memory effects, high ON–OFF current ratios (greater than 6.0 × 104) and high stability.

The tunable memory and multilevel data storage characteristics of BPQDs-based RRAM were investigated.49 Solution-processed BPQDs sandwiched between two layers of PMMA dielectrics showed electroforming-free resistive switching behavior with a recorded ON–OFF ratio of 3.0 × 107 for 2D materials-based RRAMs. In situ control of the SET voltage and ON–OFF ratio in BPQDs-based RRAM with compliance setting can benefit the achievement of four-level data storage via modulating the compliance value from 0.1 to 10−4 A. Solution-processed BPQDs cells can be reliably built and used on flexible substrates without degradation under many bending cycles. BPQDs-based RRAM can be applied in flexible electronic fields. Additionally, hierarchical self-assembly of BPQDs with quantum confinement effects was reported.72 This work opened up a broad range of length scales from nanometer to centimeter. BPQDs can cause acute toxicity by oxidative stress responses, mainly due to appreciable amounts of ROS inducing cell apoptosis.52 BPQDs cannot cause long-term inflammatory reactions or obvious damage in mice. BPQDs act as an effective n-type doping scheme for ML MoS2,68 which is highly beneficial to the design of FET and photodetector devices with novel functions. These unique functions of BPQDs provide new opportunities for their potential applications in photonic, electronic, biomedical and other significant fields in the near future.
6. Conclusions and outlook
6.1. Particularity and significance of BPQDs
BP nanostructures have a layer-dependent band gap tuned from 0.3 eV (bulk) to 2.0 eV (single layer) and exhibit excellent photonic and electronic properties for a broad range of applications. In addition to classic 2D layered BP nanosheets and 1D phosphorene nanoribbons, 0D BPQDs (NPs) as another emerging BP nanostructure have recently attracted considerable attention. 0D BPQDs (including BP nanodots and NPs) are distinct from their larger 2D BP cousins in terms of their general structures and properties. Compared with 2D BP, 0D BPQDs have higher band gaps, ultra-small sizes, higher surface-to-volume ratios and more active edge sites per unit mass. The diverse applications of BPQDs in various fields are attributed to their unique and excellent properties. By exploiting the inherent characteristics of exciting 0D BP nanomaterials, enhanced catalytic, biomedical and fluorescence applications can be realized. Since the first report on the preparation of BPQDs in 2015,42 increasing studies of the synthetic methods, properties and applications of BPQDs have been reported in succession. Based on the excellent properties and important applications of BPQDs reported in previous literature studies, an overall and timely review work on BPQDs as a new type of advanced functional material is greatly required for forthcoming studies. This review has systematically summarized the different synthetic methods, properties, functionalized modifications and applications of BPQDs.
6.2. Improvement of synthetic methods
In the synthesis of BPQDs, bulk BP crystals or BP powders often act as the precursor. Ultrasonic liquid-phase (top-down) exfoliation is widely employed to synthesize BPQDs in organic solvents. BP NPs can be obtained from electrochemical exfoliation, with large sizes and low monodispersity. Solvothermal treatment is facile and produces ultra-small BPQDs. Blender breaking and milling crushing are different mechanical methods to exfoliate bulk or powder BP into QDs or NPs. In addition, pulsed laser irradiation of bulk BP can be used to prepare PQDs. These methods have special advantages for different research objectives. Monodispersity is especially crucial for improving the physicochemical properties and multiple applications of BPQDs. The combination of two or more different methods is required to synthesize monodisperse BPQDs under appropriate conditions.109,110 Typically, electrochemical exfoliation can be used to produce small BP NPs; subsequent ultrasonic exfoliation efficiently transforms small BP NPs into ultra-small BPQDs. The assistance of organic ligands during preparation can improve the stability and monodispersity of BPQDs. Future research will focus on improvement of the synthetic methods, including low-cost raw materials and facile operation.
6.3. Further exploration of important properties
BPQDs possess a variety of important properties due to the unique BP nanostructures. Scientists have researched the physicochemical properties of BPQDs based on theoretical models, including their energy spectra and states, electron structures, and optical and electronic characteristics. In experiments, scientists demonstrated BPQDs that exhibit excellent NLO behavior, fluorescence emission, photothermal conversion, ROS generation, and electronic, photonic and photoelectronic properties. Although these properties of BPQDs have been mentioned, some challenges remain. Efforts are required in the near future to focus on the elucidation of the electron structure-related mechanisms of BPQDs to improve their present properties and extend these properties towards new research fields. The combination of theoretical models and practical experiments is an effective approach to explore new BP nanostructures with new and superior properties. Some significant properties of BPQDs have not been explored, such as upconversion luminescence (UCL) and two-photon excited fluorescence. BPQDs have excellent NLO behaviour; thus, they are expected to demonstrate UCL properties. The forthcoming research on BPQDs will be rationally driven by the development of other 2D materials-derived QDs.110–112 To optimize the properties of BPQDs, proper functional modification of BPQDs is required. In future, characteristic photonic or electronic behavior may be obtained for BPQDs/semiconductors core/shell hetero-nanostructures. The fluorescence origin of BPQDs will be further explored to acquire abundant photophysical information (such as fluorescence lifetime), which is useful for the improvement of the quantum yield and photostability of BPQDs.
6.4. Functionalized modification for versatile devices
The superior properties of BPQDs show many significant applications, especially in biomedical, electronic and photoelectronic fields. Prior to these potential applications, BPQDs are usually functionalized through modification with other substances or combined with functional substances on the surface of BPQDs, including BPQDs/nanosheets hybrids, BPQDs-doping films, BPQDs-molecules complexes, polymers-modified BPQDs, and assembly of BPQDs in devices. Synergistic superiority from the BPQDs and 2D nanosheets induces improved electronic conductivity of the 0D–2D heterostructures. BPQDs-doping films present the capacity of electrochemical sensing in intelligent devices and serve as SAs with broadband optical saturable absorption. BPQDs-molecules complexes are often used for small-size imaging agents and fluorescence probe systems. In biological and medical fields, BPQDs modified with biocompatible polymers can act as stabilizing or coating reagents. The assembly of BPQDs and BPQDs-based complexes is used to fabricate versatile photonic and electronic devices, such as OPVs, HPSCs and RRAMs. BPQDs will be further developed as good candidates for functionalized nanomaterials in applications by designing versatile and efficient BPQDs-based intelligent systems.
6.5. Highly efficient and significant applications
When BPQDs undergo functionalized modifications, considerable studies report various potential applications of the resulting BPQDs-based hybrid systems. Significantly, polymers-modified BPQDs are widely used for cancer therapy, including PTT, PDT or their integration. Cancer cells can be killed in vitro due to BPQDs-dose-dependent PTT or PDT effects. In vivo PTT or PDT of cancer is realized in tumor-bearing mice. The low phototoxicity and high biocompatibility of polymers-modified BPQDs benefits their biomedical applications, together with highly efficient cancer therapy. BPQDs are also applied to fluorescence imaging in vitro and PAI and thermal imaging in vivo. The combination of cancer therapy and bioimaging from BPQDs is promising in clinical therapeutics towards high-resolution and real-time evaluation of therapy efficacy in vivo. BPQDs-molecules complexes as fluorescence probe systems can be applied to the detection of heavy-metal ions and biomolecules. Due to their high hole mobility and suitable energy band levels, BPQDs-based devices are being developed in the photovoltaic and photoelectronic fields for enhancing light harvesting, photon conversion, HER, SA or pulsed lasers. Versatile BPQDs-inserted electronic apparatus are being explored for humidity and vapour sensing and memory and data storage devices. BPQDs-based platforms are used for constructing drugs, gene carriers and multifunctional biolabels. BPQDs-based hybrid systems with high stability and superior properties and functions will find new opportunities for potential applications in photonic, electronic, biomedical and other important fields.
