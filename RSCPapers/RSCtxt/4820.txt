    , Accepted 26th September 2012First published on 3rd October 2012AbstractHere, we present the preparation of a Ag/NaYF4:Yb,Er composite film via a simple assembly method and its considerably enhanced multicolor emissions owing to the strong coupling between the 980 nm excitation light and the ultra-broad surface plasma resonance (SPR) of silver.
In recent years, near-infrared (NIR) to visible up-conversion luminescence (UCL) via the multi-photon absorption of rare-earth (RE) doped fluoride materials has drawn considerable interest, due to its potential applications in lasers, solar cells, biological fluorescence imaging and detection, IR quantum counters, next-generation lighting, and three-dimensional displays.1–5 However, the UCL efficiency of these nanocrystals (NCs) is usually low (<1%),6 meanwhile, the small absorption cross-section of excitation light also limits the efficiency. Therefore, improving the efficiency of UCL remains one of the most important challenges in this area. Plasmonic modulation of multicolor emissions offers a promising way to enhance the UCL efficiency.7–10 The origin of plasmonic enhancement can be fundamentally classified into two major effects: (1) SPR induced absorption enhancement of emitters due to the local field enhancement effect; (2) the increase of radiative decay rate of emitters due to the resonance of the emission of SP of noble metals. So the guiding principle for UCL enhancement is to tune the SPR peak to the excitation/emission wavelength of the luminescent NCs. The SPR arises from collective oscillation of electrons on the metal nanoparticles (NPs) and generally speaking, the SPR peak can be adjusted through changing the nanoparticle size, shape and surrounding dielectric medium, and the plasmon coupling among them.11–14 The plasmon coupling takes place in the near field when the NPs are in close proximity to each other so that the electron oscillations in each NP are affected by the local field associated with the electron oscillations in neighboring NPs. The Yb,Er co-doped NaYF4 can absorb the NIR light around 980 nm, which is a biologically transparent window, and achieve relatively effective UCL.15,16 Recently, a number of experiments have been performed to improve the UCL of NaYF4:Yb,Er or NaYF4:Yb,Tm through the coupling between RE ions and noble NPs (silver and gold).17–22 However, in these hybrids, the SPR peaks of these metal NPs are mostly confined to the visible region, which cannot couple with the NIR excitation light. Furthermore, in the preparation of these hybrids, since the chemical control methods are usually involved, some uncertain factors would be introduced, such as surfactants, temperature, solutions etc., which may largely affect the intensity of UCL.
In this work, the assembly method is used to prepare the Ag/NaYF4:Yb,Er hybrids, which can not only easily adjust the SPR location of Ag NPs23,24 but also exclude the influence of the chemical factors. Here, the Ag nano-film has an ultra-broad SPR range of 350–1100 nm due to the plasmon coupling of neighboring Ag NPs,14,25 which overlaps with both the visible UCL and the 980 nm excitation light. In contrast to the NaYF4:Yb,Er nano-film, an enhancement of 3–4 fold in visible and 5.7 fold in NIR was observed in the Ag/NaYF4:Yb,Er composite film.
The 40 nm silver and 10 nm NaYF4:Yb,Er NPs were prepared through an ethylene glycol reduction method11,25 and the thermal decomposition of rare earth/sodium trifluoroacetic acid in oleylamine, respectively, as reported previously.15 Then, the solvent evaporation method was used to assemble the Ag and NaYF4:Yb,Er NPs layer-by-layer on a glass substrate (see ESI†). Firstly, the Ag nano-film was prepared by assembling the silver NPs on the glass substrate, and then the NaYF4:Yb,Er NPs were further assembled on the glass substrate and the Ag nano-film (Scheme 1(a)).
 Scheme 1  The schematic (a), the multicolor emissions (collected by reflection) (b) and (collected by transmittance) (c) of the as-prepared film. 

Fig. 1(a) and (b) show the TEM images of the Ag and NaYF4:Yb,Er NPs. It can be seen that both of them are uniform and mono-dispersed, with average diameters of 40 nm and 10 nm, respectively. Fig. 1(c) and (d) show the SEM images of the Ag nano-film and the Ag/NaYF4:Yb,Er film, indicating that the dense layer of Ag NPs or NaYF4:Yb,Er is formed on the glass substrate or on the Ag film. The thicknesses of them are determined to be ∼150 nm, and ∼120 nm, respectively. The NaYF4:Yb,Er nano-film has the same surface morphology and thickness as the composite film. Fig. S1† represents the XRD patterns of the Ag film and the Ag/NaYF4:Yb,Er composite film on the glass substrate and the corresponding standard cards, JCPDS 87-0717 for cubic silver and 28-1192 for hexagonal phase NaYF4.15 It can be seen that the pure cubic silver and hexagonal phase NaYF4 are prepared. In the Ag/NaYF4:Yb,Er composite film, the 111 face of cubic silver can be clearly distinguished, indicating the formation of the Ag/NaYF4:Yb,Er composite film.

The absorption and reflection spectra of Ag NPs and the Ag nano-film were measured, as shown in Fig. 2. An absorption peak centering around ∼425 nm was observed in the aqueous solution of Ag NPs, originating from the localized SPR of individual Ag NP.14 The absorption of the Ag nano-film is a broad band extending from 350–1100 nm, which largely differs from the absorption of Ag NPs and can be attributed to the strong plasmon coupling among the neighboring Ag NPs.25 From the reflection spectrum of the Ag nano-film, the reflectance is found to be less than ∼10% in the range of 300–550 nm, and it gradually increases with increasing wavelength. In the NIR region (800–1200 nm), the reflectance approaches ∼47%.

The multicolor emissions (collected by reflection) of the NaYF4:Yb,Er nano-film and the Ag/NaYF4:Yb,Er composite film were compared under the same conditions (see Scheme 1(b)). Fig. 3(a) shows the emission spectrum of the NaYF4:Yb,Er nano-film, including the visible UCL and IR emissions: 2H9/2–4I15/2 at 410 nm, 2H11/2–4I15/2 at 525 nm, 4S3/2–4I15/2 at 546 nm, 4F9/2–4I15/2 at 660 nm and 4I13/2–4I15/2 at 1530 nm, respectively.15,16 And the corresponding energy-level diagram of Yb3+/Er3+ is shown in Fig. S2.† In the Ag/NaYF4:Yb,Er film, the luminescent enhancement was observed for all the transitions, depending strongly on excitation power as well as the emission wavelength (see Fig. 2(b)). It can be concluded that the maximum enhancement factor (EF) of the visible UCL is about 3–4 fold, corresponding to a low excitation power of 30 mW. For the 4I13/2–4I15/2 IR transition, the maximum EF is 5.7, corresponding to the power of 570 mW (in the NaYF4:Yb,Er nano-film, the 4I13/2–4I15/2 emission begins at this power point). And as the excitation power increases, the EF of all the transitions gradually decreases, while a turn point (∼300 mW) appears in the visible UCL.
 Fig. 3  The multicolor emission spectrum of the NaYF4:Yb,Er nano-film (a) and the power-dependent enhancement factor (b), the multicolor emission intensity as ln–ln plots (c–e) and the deduced sample temperature (f) as a function of excitation power of the NaYF4:Yb,Er nano-film and the Ag/NaYF4:Yb,Er composite film. 
In order to better understand the fact above, the emission intensity as a function of excitation power for all the transitions is recorded, as shown in Fig. 3(c)–(e). It can be seen that for all the visible UCL, the values of slope n (IUCL ∝ ILasern) in Ag/NaYF4:Yb,Er are smaller than those in NaYF4:Yb,Er, and they are all much smaller than the required photon number (n = 2, 3) populating the corresponding levels. In the Ag/NaYF4:Yb,Er composite film, there exists two slopes for all the UCL levels, and among them intensity maximums occur. All the facts above can be attributed to the saturation effect as well as the local thermal effect induced by the laser exposure.26 For 4I13/2–4I15/2 emission, there exist two values of n for the two samples (Fig. 3(e)). Both high emission threshold and power-dependence (n > 1) indicate that the population for 4I13/2 may mainly come from a multi-photon process, instead of a one-photon process. It is worth noting that in the Ag/NaYF4:Yb,Er composite film, the 4I13/2–4I15/2 transition has lower threshold power. Fig. 3(f) displays the deduced local temperature (based on RHS) of the sample as a function of excitation power. It can be seen that the Ag/NaYF4:Yb,Er composite film has a much higher temperature than the NaYF4:Yb,Er nano-film, which is due to the absorption by the silver nano-film of the 980 nm excitation light and effective photo-thermal transfer, leading to the increase of nonradiative relaxation and decrease of EF.3
To clarify the origin of luminescent enhancement, first, let us consider the optical reflection effect of the Ag nano-film on the luminescence enhancement. The transmittance of the NaYF4:Yb,Er nano-film to the 980 nm light is 75% (measured by absorption spectroscopy), and the reflection of the Ag nano-film to the 980 nm light is 47% and to the visible emissions is about 10%. Thus it can be roughly estimated that due to the reflection of the Ag film, the excitation light increases about 35.2%, while the emission light increases about 10%. Totally, the visible UCL should increase up to 1.5 times due to the reflection of the Ag nano-film.
Second, let us consider the influence of the Ag nano-film on the radiative and nonradiative transition rates of Er3+. The rising and decay dynamics curves of the 4S3/2–4I15/2 transition for Er3+ ions under the excitation of a 980 nm pulsed laser with a weak power of several mW were recorded, which can be well fitted to a double exponential function,  (Fig. S3†).27 Here, τ1 is determined to be 22.6 μs in the NaYF4:Yb,Er nano-film and 23.4 μs in the Ag/NaYF4:Yb,Er composite film. The τ0 is determined to be 185 and 144 μs, respectively. Based on the dynamic equations, the rising time constant is dominated by the decay rate of 2F7/2–2F5/2 for Yb3+, the total energy transfer (ET) rate from Yb3+ to Er3+ and the nonradiative relaxation rate of 4F7/2–4S3/2. The rise time constant is almost the same for the two samples, suggesting that these transition rates nearly remain as a constant under weak excitation.27 Because the gap of 4S3/2–4F9/2 is about two times larger than that of 4F7/2–4S3/2, the variation of the nonradiative transition of 4S3/2–4F9/2 in the two samples can be also neglected. This is reasonable, because the thickness of the NaYF4:Yb,Er nano-film (∼120 nm) is much larger than the effective distance of the nonradiative ET from NaYF4:Yb,Er NCs to silver NPs. Therefore, the reduction (∼25%) of decay time constant in the composite film can be mainly attributed to the increase of the radiative rate of 4S3/2–4I15/2.
Based on considerable UCL enhancement (3–4 times), limited interaction of optical reflection (1.5 times) and variation of the radiative transition rate (1.25 times), it can be claimed that the luminescent enhancement was mainly induced by the field enhancement effect, because of the coupling of the 980 nm excitation light with SPR of the Ag NPs.20
It should be further highlighted that under 443 nm and 488 nm excitation the visible emission intensity of Er3+ ions is almost the same for the two samples. As mentioned above (see Fig. 2), in the range of 350–550 nm, the SPR of the Ag nano-film mainly contributes to absorption, not to scattering and reflection. Thus, we can conclude that under 443 nm and 488 nm excitation, the localized SPR enhancement effect is too weak to achieve the luminescent enhancement. In contrast, the SPR of the Ag nano-film largely contributes to scattering and reflection in the range of 800–1200 nm, thus it would strongly couple with the 980 nm excitation light, leading to the significant luminescence enhancement. So under 980 nm excitation, the coupling between the 4S3/2–4I15/2 emission as well as the other emissions of Er3+ ions and SPR of the Ag nano-film should be weak and has only a relatively small impact on the luminescence enhancement.
In addition, the emission intensity of the Ag/NaYF4:Yb,Er composite film measured by the transmission light (see Scheme 1(c)) is lower than that of NaYF4:Yb,Er, which can be attributed to the strong absorption and reflection of the Ag nano-film for the multicolor emissions (Fig. S4†).
In conclusion, the Ag/NaYF4:Yb,Er composite film was prepared via an assembly method. It is with strong SPR of silver, ranging from 350–1100 nm. Because of the strong coupling between the 980 nm excitation light and SPR of Ag NPs, remarkable enhancement of UCL and IR emissions were observed, which depended strongly on the excitation power and emission wavelength.
