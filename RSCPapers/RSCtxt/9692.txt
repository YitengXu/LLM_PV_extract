    , Accepted 18th December 2018First published on 18th December 2018AbstractThe photothermoelectric (PTE) effect in conductive polymers is significant because it combines high photothermal (PT) and thermoelectric (TE) effects. Using poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) films with various conductivities and crystallinities, the PTE effect in thin films can be established. The PT temperature increase (ΔTPT) under light exposure and the thermal voltage induced by ΔTPT for a series of PEDOT films indicated an unparalleled sensitivity to the carrier mobility in PT and TE conversions. The PTE Seebeck coefficients (SPTE) and power factors (PFPTE) for the PEDOT films correlated well with those in the dark state, indicating that the PTE effect in PEDOT can be translated into the TE effect induced by heating upon light exposure. The 180 nm-thick pristine PEDOT film shows high PFPTE values of 620 and 590 μW m−1 K−2 for a near-infrared laser and sunlight, respectively. The thin-film solar TE harvester with four PEDOT legs generates a power density of 38 mW m−2 and an energy density of 420 W h g−1, demonstrating the first and highest absorber-free organic solar TE output yet reported. Thus, the PT conversion mechanisms in CP films can be extended to thin-film solar energy harvesters.
Introduction
When semiconductors absorb electromagnetic radiation, they generate hot electrons that produce temperature gradients.1o Such photothermal (PT) effects have shown great potential in applications including photoacoustic spectroscopy, photodynamic therapy, photodetection, printing, and cell sheet engineering.2–10 Since PT materials generate temperature increases (ΔTPT) upon light exposure at the interface between two materials having different thermoelectric (TE) powers, a photothermoelectric (PTE) response is measurable even at room temperature.11 In addition, most PT materials absorb near-infrared (NIR) light and can be used as absorbers for photovoltaic panels.12 However, the PT and PTE conversion mechanisms of conjugated polymer films are not yet completely understood and have been rarely used for energy harvesting applications.
PTE materials reported to date have been limited to graphene13–15 and inorganic materials16,17 such as InAs, InP, and MoS2, which require precisely controlled deposition techniques for synthesis. Furthermore, the PTE effect has only been measured under light generated by an accurately focused laser beam, in order to maximize light power. Finally, PTE effects from these materials have mostly been examined under external voltages supplied under biased conditions because of their low PTE efficiencies.
Recently, conductive polymers (CPs) have shown high PT conversion efficiencies (ηPT, >40%) and large thermoelectric power factors (PFTE, >1270 μW K−2 m−1),18–20 indicating that they are strong candidate PTE materials for flexible and large-area devices. In addition, CPs have high absorption coefficients in the NIR region in the doped state and low thermal conductivities (∼0.37 W m−1 K−1), suggesting that CP films may show preferable carrier-gradient to lattice-gradient PTE effects. Thus, much higher PTE effects could be achieved with CPs because heat conduction in the lattice does not contribute significantly to temperature equilibrium. In this sense, CPs also have significant advantages over conventional PTE materials, where phonon-driven heat flow is a serious limitation.
Nevertheless, the reported PTE power factors (PFPTE) of CPs remain low, e.g., 354.7 μW m−1 K−2 for hexyl poly(3,4-ethylenedioxyselenophene)s,21 mainly because of their low electrical conductivities and instability upon air exposure. However, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)s (PEDOTs) show a high ηPT and large PFTE,18,22–24 and could therefore be explored as PTE film devices once the PT energy conversion mechanisms in PEDOT films are understood.
Herein, we report the PTE effects of PEDOT films, which benefit from high ηPT and solution processability. The compositions and doping levels of the PEDOT films can be tailored to obtain high temperature increases and PTE effects, which largely originate from the controlled structural order of polymers and their carrier mobilities. Taking advantage of the high achieved PTE effect, a PEDOT film was applied as a thin-film solar energy harvester, demonstrating the first example of a CP-based solar TE harvester under bias-free conditions. This research provides general guidelines regarding the PTE mechanism and the potential applicability of CPs for bias-free and absorber-free thin-film solar TE harvesters.
Experimental section
Materials
Iron(III) p-toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate, iron(III) p-toluenesulfonate hexahydrate, poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(propylene glycol)-block-poly(ethylene glycol) (PEPG, average molecular weight 2800), 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT), pyridine, ferrocene, anhydrous n-butanol, isopropyl alcohol, tetrabutylammonium perchlorate, and anhydrous propylene carbonate were purchased from Aldrich Chemicals. All other materials were used without further purification.
Preparation of the P4 films
P4 films were prepared using solution casting polymerization (SCP). PEPG (0.20 g) was added to the oxidative solution (1.0 g, 40 wt% of iron(III) p-toluenesulfonate in n-butanol) and stirred for 2 h. Pyridine (11.6 mg) was added to the solution and stirred for 2 h. Then, a homogeneous red solution was obtained by filtration using a hydrophilic syringe filter (0.45 μm) and EDOT (37.8 mg) was added prior to use. The molar composition of the mixture was monomer:iron(III) p-toluenesulfonate:pyridine = 1:2.64:0.55. Large PET films or glass slides (2.5 × 3 to 5 × 7 cm2) were treated with O2 plasma for 3 min with a flow rate of 40.0 sccm to increase the uniformity of the polymer film. The monomeric solution was spin coated onto the substrates using various spin speeds (700–2500 rpm) to control the thickness of the final polymer films and heated at 60–80 °C and 35% RH for 2 h as shown in Table S1 (ESI†). Then, the polymer films were washed with ethanol to remove the catalyst, residual oxidant, and impurities. Finally, the polymer films were dried under N2 flow and annealed at 60 °C for 5 min. The polymerization mechanism is shown in Scheme S1 (ESI†).
Measurement of thermoelectric and photothermoelectric properties
The Seebeck voltage and the temperature gradient were measured using a homemade shielded setup and an Agilent 34410A Multimeter and Agilent 34970A, respectively. The parallel Au electrodes were thermally evaporated at a rate of 1 Å s−1 on a polymer film with a size of 2 × 0.2 cm2 and a thickness of 100 nm at a pressure of 5 × 10−6 mbar using a stainless steel shadow mask.22 The doping level of the film was precisely controlled by cyclic voltammetry, and the cyclic voltammetry was stopped at the desired potential in the conductive electrode-free polymer film used as a self-electrode. In general, two Peltier devices were fixed on an aluminum heat sink using thermal paste (PK-3, Prolimatech), and a temperature gradient was generated between the two Peltier devices (∼4 mm gap) (Scheme S2, ESI†). The temperature gradient was controlled using a Keithley 2400 Multimeter by changing the input current to the two Peltier devices simultaneously. The temperature gradient between the two Peltier devices was measured using T-type thermocouples, which were placed in contact with the two Au electrodes using a z-direction controllable stage. Eleven points for ΔT and ΔV were obtained 3 times by changing the source current for each sample and linearly plotted to calculate the Seebeck coefficient. All of the thermoelectric measurements were performed at room temperature. For the temperature dependent experiment, a probe station (Probe station, M5VCMF, MS Tech Inc.) was used with the same setting as above.
The photothermoelectrically generated temperature gradients, voltages, and currents were measured using a similar procedure to that for the thermoelectric properties. A polymer film on the PET film was laminated using a thermal coater. The temperature gradient was controlled by the intensity of the NIR laser, which irradiated one side of the polymer film from 2.33 to 0 W cm−2 in the probe station at 30 mTorr or at atmospheric pressure (∼760 Torr). An LED was controlled by the current from the source meter and irradiated on one side of the films with a diameter of 3 mm. The colors of the LED light were ultraviolet, blue, green, and red and had maximum intensity peaks at 400, 460, 532, and 630 nm, respectively. Five points for ΔT, ΔV, and resistance were obtained 3 times by changing the source current for each sample and linearly plotted to calculate the photothermal voltage. All of the photothermoelectric measurements were performed at room temperature. A halogen lamp source was controlled using a fiber source measurement system and irradiated one side of the films with a diameter of 2 mm. The generated voltages or currents were measured using a Keithley 2636 System SourceMeter and TRX-50-1 triaxial cable (Trompeter electronics).
Characterization
Electrochemical studies were performed using a CHI624B (CH Instruments, Inc.) potentiostat with a PEDOT film as the working electrode (self-electrode), a platinum plate as the counter electrode, and a Ag/AgCl wire as the reference electrode; 0.1 M TBAPC/PC was the supporting electrolyte. The E1/2 = (Epa + Epc)/2 of the Fc/Fc+ couple was 0.38 V against Ag/AgCl. The resistance (R) of the conductive polymer films was measured using a potentiostat and a four-point probe (Macor probe, 1.00 mm probe spacing, 200 μm tip radius, 100 g loads, Jandel, UK). The thickness (t) of the conductive polymer films was measured using an Alpha step profilometer (Tencor Instruments, Alpha-step IQ) with an accuracy of 1 nm. The electrical conductivity (σ) was calculated using the equation σ = ln2/πRt. The charge carrier concentration, carrier mobility, and Hall coefficient were measured using an HMS-5300 Hall measurement system (Ecopia) with a magnetic field of 0.53 T at room temperature. Polymer films on PET films were cut into areas of 1 × 1 cm2, and the edge was soldered with In 95% Sn 5%. The polymer films were peeled off and weighed using a microbalance (Sartorius CPA2P, resolution of 0.001 mg). The heat capacity of the conductive polymer was measured using a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) 200 F3, Netzsch in a temperature range from −10 °C to 50 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under a nitrogen atmosphere. Particle size measurements were carried by dynamic light scattering (DLS) using a Zetasizer nano ZS90 system (Malvern Instruments). DLS experiments showed that the solution of 40 wt% of Fe(Tos)3 in n-butanol containing PEPG forms micelles of ∼15–20 nm size that remain stable for 3 days (Fig. S4, ESI†). Upon the addition of the monomer, the solution underwent polymerization to yield strongly colored large particles (∼70–300 nm) within 3 min, and then formed microscale particles within 1 h at 25 °C. At 60 °C, the polymerization occurred much faster than at 25 °C, affording microparticles within 5 min. The samples were exposed to an NIR laser (1.6 W cm−2) through an X-ray protective window at an angle of 45°. High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) was performed on a JEOL JEM-F200 at 120 kV. Grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) spectra were collected at the 3C beamline in the Pohang Accelerator Laboratory (PAL) using a monochromatized 10.25 eV (λ = 0.121 nm) X-ray irradiation source with a two-dimensional charge-coupled device detector (Mar165 CCD). The scattering vector (q) was calculated from the equation: q = 4πsin(θ)/λ.
Results and discussion
Preparation of PEDOTs with different conductivities
Because hot electron effects in CPs are highly affected by the material conductivities, the film conductivities were varied by using different solution compositions for polymerization; the basic solution contained 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) as a monomer and Fe(Tos)3 as an oxidant in n-butanol as the solvent. To this polymerization solution, different ratios of pyridine (PY) and the polymeric surfactant poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(propylene glycol)-block-poly(ethylene glycol) triblock copolymer (PEPG) were added. The solutions were then coated on substrates to prepare PEDOT films doped with p-toluenesulfonate molecules (PEDOT:Tos) (Table 1).

The PEDOT films prepared from solutions containing both PY and PEPG (P1–P6) show the high electrical conductivities (σ) of 1230–940 S cm−1, which are well matched with a previous report.22 The conductivity of P2 is 4.1 times higher than that of P7, prepared from a solution containing PEPG only. PEDOT films with lower σ (P8 and P9) were prepared from the solution with low PEPG content and no PY. Further decreases in the σ of the PEDOT films were achieved using polymerization solutions containing PY but not PEPG at high water contents (P10 and P11). In addition, the σ of PEDOT films was further controlled by electrochemical doping. The PEDOT film with a high σ (P1) was obtained by electrochemical doping22 at 0.9 V. Through these methods, we successfully prepared a series of PEDOT-based films with a wide range of σ from 8.2 × 10−3 to 1.32 × 103 S cm−1. The samples are numbered in the order of decreasing σ (Table 1).
The absorption spectra of the PEDOT films vary depending on the pristine film compositions (Fig. 1a). As shown in Fig. 1b, the film conductivity is increased with the increasing absorbance of the film at 1064 nm (A1064), indicating that the carriers in PEDOT are bipolaronic in nature, as reported before.25,26 However, the correlation of the absorbance at 808 nm (A808) with σ is poor, mainly because of the decreasing contribution of polaronic carriers in highly doped PEDOT films (Fig. S1a, ESI†).

(b) Correlation of the A1064, χC, and conductivity of various polymer films. (c) GIWAXS spectra of P2 (top) and P3 (bottom). (d) Cross-sectional qz plot of various PEDOT films. Inset: schematic of the crystal structure of the PEDOT chains on the substrate. 
The absorbance of the film is well matched to the thickness of the PEDOT film (Fig. S1c and d, ESI†), following the Beer–Lambert law with slopes (absorption coefficients) of 42000 and 52000 cm−1 and high correlation constants R2 = 0.995 and 0.992 for A808 and A1064, respectively. As the absorption in the NIR region is strongly related to the PT temperature increase, the PT effect is conveniently tuned by manipulating the solution composition, electrochemical doping, and film thickness.
Subsequently, to gain fundamental insight into the ordering of the polymer chains in the PEDOT films, the degree of crystallinity (χC) of the polymers was determined by grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measured at beamline 3C of the Pohang Acceleration Laboratory, as well as by X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Fig. 1c, d, S2, and S3†). The GIWAXS spectrum for P3 shows a high χC (37 ± 2%) in the z-direction, in which the PEDOT chains are more likely stacked as a sheet (Fig. 1d, inset).19,27,28 The polymer sheets are oriented parallel to the substrate surface (a axis), which may favor carrier transport through the in-plane direction. The interchain edge-to-edge distances d100 are 13.9 and 12.3 Å for P3 and P2, respectively, as determined from the sharp (100) peaks at the scattering vector along the z-direction of qz at 0.45 and 0.51 Å−1, respectively (Table S1, ESI†). These d100 values are similar to the reported value (14.0 Å).19 For in-plane directional diffraction, both the x- and y-directions show similar scattering patterns of 1.80 Å−1 (d010 = 3.5 Å) for P4 (Fig. S3, ESI†), implying that the ordering in the b and c axis directions may be averaged out in the bulk. Importantly, the χC values determined from the (100) peaks for the PEDOT films correlate well with the σ of the films (Fig. 1b, black diamond) and A1064 (blue dot), demonstrating that the polymerization solution composition and doping control the structural order of the bipolaronic states, which directly affect the film conductivity.
The differences in crystallinity for different PEDOTs can be attributed to the formation of PEPG-induced micellar structures that generate high crystallinity in PEDOT films.27,29 Indeed, dynamic light scattering (DLS) experiments showed that the formation of micellar structures containing an oxidant could favor the ordering of PEDOT units (Fig. S4, ESI†), because polymerization occurs near the oxidant molecules that are captured at hydrophilic PEG shells (see ESI†). Thus, the P10–P11 films showed weak (100) peaks and the lowest χC values, mainly because no PEPG was used in their synthesis.27,30 P7–P9 films showed smaller (100) peaks with a lower χC than those in the P1–P6 films, because the absence of PY facilitates polymerization by scavenging protons. Schematics of the mechanism for the polymerization process are shown in Fig. S4 and Scheme S1 (ESI†).
PT properties of PEDOTs
The temperatures of the PEDOT films were increased upon exposure to a NIR laser (collimated, 808 or 1064 nm), as shown in the thermal images of the films (Fig. 2a). The ΔTPT of a 180 nm-thick P4 film reached 100 K at an input 808 nm laser power (I0) of 191 mW and increases linearly with I0, as expected from eqn (1):21,31 (1)where ηPT is the PT conversion efficiency, h is the heat-transfer coefficient, a is the surface area of the film, and Qsub is the heat dissipated from absorbed light energy by the substrate. ΔTPT was maximized within 10 s of irradiation (Fig. 2b) and then remained constant for prolonged laser exposure because of the thermal equilibrium between PT heating and heat transfer to the surroundings. The P9 film showed the highest ΔTPT (127 K) while P1 showed the lowest (86 K) among the PEDOT samples under 808 nm irradiation (191 mW). ΔTPT was linearly increased as the film became thicker, because absorbed light energy is proportional to the thickness (Fig. S5 and S6, ESI†). When the laser was turned off, the ΔTPT was decreased to near-zero within 10 s. From the cooling trajectory while the laser was off (Fig. 2b, inset), the ηPT of the polymer films was determined as described in the ESI.†31,32 The increase of ΔTPT at the substrate without PEDOT was negligible (Fig. S6c, ESI†) under the same laser exposure, possibly because of the high transparency of the thin-film polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrate. Thus, the determination of ηPT by measuring ΔTPT was straightforward for the PEDOT films (eqn (S5) and Table S4, ESI†).

(b) Evolution of temperature increase for polymer films upon exposure to an 808 nm NIR laser (0.191 W) with the light source removed after 60 s. (c) Correlation of ηPT at 808 nm (red dot) and 1064 nm (blue dot) with the conductivities of polymer films. (d) Correlation of conductivities with the Seebeck coefficients (black square), power factors (red circle), degrees of crystallinity (green circle), and Hall mobilities (blue square) of polymer films. 
The P9 film exhibited a maximum ηPT of 78% and 93% upon exposure to 808 nm and 1064 nm lasers, respectively. As shown in Fig. 2c, the ηPT was increased as the σ of PEDOT was decreased, but was increased in the very low σ region, from 8.2 × 10−3 S cm−1 (P11) to 0.25 S cm−1 (P9). Similarly, the P9 film exhibits a maximum ηPT of 93% under 1064 nm laser (220 mW) exposure (Fig. 2c, blue dot).
This effect of σ on ηPT for highly conductive polymer films can be ascribed to a change in the carrier mobility (μ), which is determined from the carrier concentration (p).33 The increase in σ of a film causes increases in p and also increases the number of scattering sites, which reduce μ in highly conductive polymer films.34,35 Indeed, the μ of PEDOT films, determined from Hall effect measurements, was maximized at 0.35 cm2 V−1 s−1 in P9, with a p of 4.4 × 1018 cm−3 (Table 1, Fig. 2d, blue square). Further increases in σ decrease the μ of the films. Interestingly, the ηPT for both 808 nm and 1064 nm laser exposure was almost linearly dependent on log(μ), as shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†). It is noteworthy that the ηPT,808 value for the highly conductive films stayed at ∼40–50%; e.g., the ηPT,808 for P3 and P5 were 49 and 52%, respectively. This could be attributed to their μ, which are smaller than those for P7–P9 but still high (μ ≥ 0.04 cm2 V−1 s−1).
The PT temperature distribution of P4 on a PET film was simulated using the model for heat transfer in a solid by COMSOL Multiphysics® software (Table S3 and Fig. S8, ESI†). A three-dimensional modeling of the samples under 808 nm NIR irradiation was performed under the same experimental conditions. Heat transfer by conduction through two layers was selected as the natural cooling system. Convective and radiative heat transfer through the surrounding system (air) was assumed as constant. The boundary condition was room temperature. The emissivity of the P4 sample was determined as 0.97 from the reflectance data in Fig. S1e and f.†
The maximum temperature increase (ΔTmax) was calculated using the same light power as the experiment. The calculated ΔTmax was 101 K, which is in good agreement with the experimental value (ΔTmax = 106 K) within 5% uncertainty (Fig. S8, ESI†). The simulation result was similar to the previous result within ∼0.5 K difference.18 Thus, the experimentally determined ηPT values for PEDOT films could be confirmed accordingly.
TE properties in the dark
To explore the conversion efficiency of the photothermally generated heat into electrical output, the TE properties and heat sensitivities of the PEDOT films were determined independently, by measuring the TE voltage (ΔVTE) under dark condition as described in the ESI.† The Seebeck coefficients in the dark (STE) was determined from ΔVTE in Fig. S9 (ESI†) for films under temperature differences of ΔT(STE = ΔVTE/ΔT). The STE is decreased with increasing σ in the low-conductivity polymer samples in region I (Fig. 2d). On the other hand, the STE is dramatically increased with increasing χC in region II, after which the STE is decreased as σ increases with electrochemical doping.
The effects of the σ, μ, and χC of polymers on the STE are theoretically known.36,37 Briefly, σ and p are linked to the doping and density of states (DOSs) profile around the Fermi level (EF).38 The σ of TE materials is generally represented as the carrier transport in states at the energy E (eqn (2)) in the absence of electron–phonon interactions: (2)where σ(E,T) is a transport function and f(E) is the Fermi–Dirac distribution function. Following Mott's formula, S is generally decreased with increasing σ,39,40 as formulated in eqn (3), where kB is the Boltzmann constant and e is the unit charge. (3)

Eqn (3) can be rewritten as an expression with terms for μ and DOS (D(EF)) as eqn (4). (4)
The μ contribution to the STE is generally not high; it is expressed as S ∝ μ0.2 for PEDOT:Tos.37 However, the DOS profile is also affected by the mobility of materials; therefore, increasing μ could increase the DOS term of STE. Indeed, the STE for P9 was larger than that for P8, mainly because of the high μ of P9. Meanwhile, the STE was increased significantly from P7 to P6, in which μ was slightly decreased. Thus, the large increase in STE may strongly depend on the DOS term of eqn (4). It has been reported that EF strongly affects the DOS region and that DOS asymmetry is enhanced with increasing structural order. Because the enhanced crystallinity of PEDOT increases carrier delocalization through the conjugation network and π-orbital overlapping in the π-stacking direction,41 the change in the crystallinity of PEDOTs directly modifies the electronic band structure near the EF, as well as the DOS shape.42 In particular, it was experimentally proved and predicted for PEDOT:Tos that improved structural order with higher σ yielded a larger STE.39,40,43 Therefore, the increase in STE from P7 (region I) to P6 (region II) is ascribed to the increased χC. As the pristine PEDOT:Tos (P4) was doped electrochemically to afford the highly conductive P1, both the χC and μ were decreased, while σ was increased. Accordingly, the STE was decreased in P1. The PFTE was the output from both σ and STE, according to eqn (5). PFTE = σSTE2(5)
Thus, the PFTE was maximized for P5, prepared from the solution containing PEPG and PY and electrochemically doped at 0.1 V.
PTE effect of PEDOT under bias-free conditions
A thin film-type harvester was prepared with PEDOT films on a flexible PET film with no top electrode (Fig. 3a). Bottom Au electrodes of 100 nm-thickness were deposited to collect the harvested PTE output. The gap between the two Au electrodes (d) was fixed at 5 mm, at which thermal diffusion after PT heating is minimized (Fig. S10, ESI†). The PEDOT films were coated on the PET film with the Au electrodes. Half of the film was covered by Al foil to avoid light exposure (dark side) and thus to achieve a temperature gradient between the electrodes under light irradiation. The dark side of the device was connected to a heat sink kept at room temperature (LTE1).

(f) The current detection of various photodetection materials are plotted as a dashed line (ref. 13: graphene, ref. 49: poly[Cux(Cu-ett)], ref. 14: graphene p–n junction, ref. 21: PEDOS-C6, and ref. 11: graphene multilayers). 
Because of its high ηPT, the PTE output of the P9 film was examined first. Upon exposure to a NIR source (808 nm, 60 mW), the P9 device generated a ΔTPT of 120 K and a large PTE voltage (VPTE) of 9.5 mV (Fig. 3b). As a reference, a 100 nm-thick Au film was exposed to the same laser under bias-free conditions (Fig. S11a, ESI†) and showed undetectable VPTE generation. The VPTE from P9 was obtained reproducibly during repeated cycling of irradiation. The P9 film showed higher ΔTPT and thus higher VPTE than the other films, as compared in Fig. 3c. However, the PTE Seebeck coefficient (SPTE) and power factor (PFPTE) of the P9 device were lower than those of devices using P3 and P4, because of the poor σ of P9. Meanwhile, the P3- and P4-based devices showed the highest PFPTE and SPTE, respectively (Fig. 3d, Table 1).
Interestingly, the PTE effects (SPTE and PFPTE) for most of the PEDOT films correlated well with those in the dark state (STE and PFTE) with a 1:1 match (black dashed line) as shown in Fig. 3d. The SPTE of P2 and P5 was 15–20% lower than STE. With these differences, the PFPTE of P2 and P5 was higher than the PFTE. This difference between the TE and PTE properties of PEDOT films may arise from several factors, including the difference in ΔT of 5 and 86–127 K, respectively. Nonetheless, the obvious matching of the TE and PTE properties of the PEDOT films suggests that the PTE effect can be translated into a TE effect, induced by the PT heating of PEDOT that generates ΔTPT as a function of Aλ and ηPT (eqn (1)).
Therefore, the mechanism for the PTE effect of PEDOT could be described as four physical processes (Fig. 3e), similar to that of the semiconductor.44–46 (i) Photoexcitation of CP films causes rapid (∼<1 ps) nonequilibrium heating that generates hot carriers, (ii) which undergo vibrational relaxation to the lowest excited singlet state (S1). (iii) Then, the charge carriers (holes for PEDOTs) are relaxed to the ground state (S0) through non-radiative relaxation pathways, with evolution of heat at the light-exposed area. During this process, ΔTPT is established between the illuminated and dark regions as the hot carriers are coupled to lattice phonons, followed by phonon–phonon coupling. (iv) Because of the ΔTPT development, the carriers flow from the illuminated hot area to the dark room-temperature area, thus generating a VPTE by the TE effect. The direct photo-Seebeck effect is, in general, negligible for organic materials. Indeed, it was much smaller than the PTE effect, as shown in Fig. S11b (ESI†).
The instantaneous PTE power (PPTE) generated by the NIR exposure voltage under bias-free conditions was determined from the product of the VPTE and current (IPTE) between the bottom electrodes (eqn (6)–(8)):47 (6) (7)and PPTE = VPTEIPTE(8)where ∇Tx is the temperature gradient and R is the resistance between the two electrodes of the PTE device. The IPTE of the films was measured directly from the PTE device (LTE1), revealing that the IPTE of P4 was comparable to that of P3 and higher than those of P1 and P9 for NIR powers of <1 to 60 mW (Fig. 3f, Table S5, ESI†). The power density from P4, structured as LTE1, was 0.13 mW m−2, which is the highest value among the PEDOT films, possibly because of the large IPTE generation of P4. Because the SPTE of the PEDOT films correlated well with the dark STE values, which were increased by increasing the crystallinity of the film (Fig. 2d), the PPTE was increased by increasing χC, as shown in Fig. S12 (ESI†). Therefore, increasing the χC of the PEDOT film, which can be detected by the increase in A1064, promotes both the conductivity and PTE power density.
Interestingly, the current generation of the P3 and P4 films in response to the NIR laser was very high compared to that of previously reported PT materials including graphene, MoS2, and poly[Cux(Cu-ett)] (Fig. 3f and Table S5, ESI†). The slope in Fig. 3f indicates the NIR sensitivity under bias-free conditions for different samples; it shows that P4 affords the highest sensitivity among the reported NIR-sensitive materials to date, including single-layer13,48 and multilayer graphenes,11 p–n junction graphenes,47 and inorganic materials.15,17,49
PTE films as solar heat harvesters
From the above results, P4 was explored as a thin-film solar TE harvester. The solar PTE device (STE1-4, Fig. S13, ESI†) was similar to the above NIR-light TE harvester (LTE1) but the electrode separation (d) was fixed as 11 mm (Fig. 4a) because of the diffusive nature of sunlight. P4 was coated on a PET film with Au electrodes; half of the sample was covered by Al foil to block sunlight and achieve ΔTPT upon sunlight exposure (STE1). With one sun exposure (1 S, 100 mW m−2), the P4 film shows a ΔTPT of 6.9 K and a solar VPTE output (VSTE) of 0.54 mV at room temperature. The SPTE from sunlight exposure (SSTE) was 78 μV K−1, which was well matched to the SPTE from NIR exposure (79 μV K−1). The IPTE from the sunlight exposure (ISTE) was 20 μA, affording a power density of 50 μW m−2 under 1 S conditions.

By exploiting the simple preparation process for P4, the solar TE output could be enhanced by increasing either the thickness or the surface area of the film. Other methods include increasing the sunlight input by using a Fresnel lens and integration of the STE1 devices into multiple legs. The VSTE of the STE1 device was more than doubled by increasing the P4 thickness from 180 to 540 nm under 1 S conditions, mainly because of the large increase of ΔTPT. While SSTE was almost equal for the thin (180 nm) and thick (540 nm) P4 films, the ISTE of the thick film was more than doubled, yielding a power output of 5× that of the thin film (Table S6, ESI†). Although the sunlight absorption of the P4 layer was limited when the P4 film was thicker than 540 nm and thus the VSTE increased little, ISTE and PPTE from sunlight exposure (PSTE) were increased further because the P4 film was thicker. In this way, a high power density of 480 μW m−2 was obtained from a 2.23 μm-thick P4 film under 1 S conditions (Table S6 and Fig. S14, ESI†).
Sunlight was concentrated and the input power was doubled (two-Sun condition, 2 S) by placing a Fresnel lens in the solar simulator (STE2). As the ΔTPT of P4 was increased by approximately 5×, both the VSTE and ISTE of the STE2 devices with different P4 thicknesses were increased by ∼4–5× under the 2 S condition, as summarized in Table S6 (ESI†). Concurrently, the ΔTPT reached 82 K and the power density was 10 mW m−2 with the 2.23 μm-thick P4 film (P4d2230) from the 2 S condition.
Because the thin-film PTE devices here use thin PEDOT films in which PEDOT is both a light absorber and the PTE layer, the PTE devices in this work can be described as absorber-free solar cells. They have very simple cell structures compared to device structures with absorbers (Fig. 4c). Thus, the PTE-based devices could be integrated as a module with multiple legs of PEDOT films. To demonstrate, four P4d2230 films are connected in series or parallel (Fig. 4b and d). For the series connection (STE3), the VSTE was increased to 26 mV, 4× that of the single leg under the 2 S condition. However, a 13% loss occurs in ISTE, possibly because of the connection resistance in the integrated device. In the parallel connection (STE4), the ISTE was increased to 1.1 mA, 4× that of the single leg under the 2 S condition. Interestingly, the voltage drop with the parallel connection was <1%, and the power density from the four-leg module with parallel connections reached 38 mW m−2. This high power density from sunlight should confirm the PTE effect of CPs as a promising method for solar TE harvesting. The surface power density of STE4 corresponds to an energy density of 420 W h g−1, which was the first and highest absorber-free organic solar TE output reported so far (Table S7, ESI†).
This PTE device exhibits good storage stability (>10000 h with ±2% variation) under ambient conditions (Fig. 4e). From these unique features of light energy conversion, the PTE device could be exploited as a thin-film energy-harvesting device and a film-type module for the solar spectrum. The device is environmentally friendly, uses low-cost materials, and is easily applicable as a thin film-type wearable power source or in wireless NIR sensor network devices.
Conclusions
PTE energy conversion under solar light at room temperature was demonstrated by exploiting the PT and TE properties of PEDOT films. To reach the highest PTE energy conversion, PEDOT films were optimized by controlling the polymer conductivity though varying the chemical composition and electrochemical doping. The ηPT for the PEDOT films varied from 20 to 73% for an 808 nm laser depending on σ and changing linearly with the carrier mobility of the PEDOT films. Among the PEDOT films, the highly ordered P4 film was very efficient in PTE power generation. The SPTE of the PEDOT films correlated well with the dark STE values, which were increased by increasing the χC of the films. Importantly, the increasing χC, which can be detected by the increase in A1064, promotes not only the conductivity but also the PTE power density. In addition, these PEDOT films showed the highest sensitivity of known PTE materials to NIR light under bias-free conditions. The PTE of PEDOT was extended further into solar energy harvesting, generating a high power density of 38 mW m−2 under 2 S conditions and showing stability for more than 10000 h under ambient conditions. These results indicate the light sensing and future application potential of low-cost conductive polymer-based materials in thin film-type wearable solar power sources, among many other devices.
