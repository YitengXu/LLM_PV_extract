    , Accepted 23rd December 2022First published on 8th February 2023AbstractUpconversion materials have attracted considerable research interest for their application in bioimaging due to their unique optical properties. NaREF4 (RE = Sc, Y, La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb and Lu) based host lattice, which is widely used for upconversion, requires expensive rare-earth elements and tedious reaction conditions. Hence there is a need to develop environmentally friendly and cost effective materials for upconversion. In this study, we propose NaBiF4 as a host material for upconversion which is based on environmentally friendly and cost-effective bismuth. NaBiF4 has not been explored as an imaging probe before. We report efficient Yb3+/Tm3+ doped NaBiF4 based upconversion submicron particles which exhibit a photostable, wide upconversion emission range (NIR-to-NIR and Vis) under NIR (980 nm) excitation, and in-vitro non-cytotoxic uptake by mammalian cancer cell lines as well as bacterial cells with a high signal to background ratio. The synthesis of the chosen host material co-doped with Yb3+/Tm3+ has not been reported earlier through such a non-aqueous quaternary reverse micelle route. Here, we functionally validate these submicron particles as viable alternatives to currently available upconversion nanomaterials and highlight their potential as luminescent probes for bioimaging.
1. Introduction
Bismuth being a non-toxic and eco-friendly metal is often termed as “Green Bismuth”.1 Due to its low cost and low toxicity, bismuth based compounds serve as a promising class of materials in various applications such as UV filters,2,3 fuel cells,4 water splitting5,6 and batteries.7,8 Interest in bismuth-based compounds as host material for upconversion (UC) arises due to characteristics such as a high refractive index, good chemical and thermal stability9–14 and low phonon energy.15 Low phonon energy results in reduced multiphonon relaxation rates which further leads to enhancement of spontaneous emission probability. Inspired by these features several host materials have been earlier developed especially based on a NaREF4 type host lattice (RE = Sc, Y, La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb and Lu).11–18 These matrices require expensive rare earth elements, which limits their application and development on a large scale. Hence, it would be desirable to develop non lanthanide host materials with appropriate properties.
NaYF4 doped with lanthanide ions are considered to be one of the efficient host materials for upconverting phosphors which is due to their low lattice phonon energy and high chemical stability. The practical issues faced by researchers are the rigorous synthesis conditions and the high cost of lanthanides (commonly referred to as “technology metals”), which prevents the widespread use of UC nanoparticles in industry and medicine.19 Lei et al. have reported a new method for developing non-rare-earth matrices by replacing yttrium(III) ions with bismuth (III) ions, which is less expensive and more environmentally friendly.20 When compared to other common inorganic matrices, these criterias help to reduce the overall cost of manufacturing nanocrystals. Compared to main group elements like bismuth the costs associated in obtaining very pure rare earth compounds is significantly higher. Hence, there is a need to develop simpler methods of synthesis and to develop environmentally friendly, cost-effective host materials for upconversion. These observations inspired us to explore new synthesis techniques and UC matrices for the future. Here, we report a green method for the synthesis of upconversion submicron particles at room temperature. This method has enhanced the efficiency of the synthesis process. Also, being a rare-earth free matrix, the cost of the material would be reduced significantly. Since the efficiency of this material is comparable to that of widely used host materials, NaBiF4 has a high prospective for development in the future and a high potential for large-scale industrial applications.
Recently, lanthanide-doped NaBiF4 have become a new promising class of inorganic phosphors. These nanophosphors have been used widely for exciting applications in biosensing, temperature sensing, and white LEDs.21 For example, Lei et al. have reported the ultrafast synthesis of NaBiF4:Yb3+/Ln3+ (Ln = Er, Tm, Ho) at room temperature which upon near-infrared light excitation shows excellent upconversion luminescence.20 Du et al. have demonstrated the use of red light emitting NaBiF4:Eu3+ for simultaneous white LEDs and field emission displays.22 Lei et al. have reported a solvothermal synthesis to prepare NaBiF4:Yb3+,Er3+,x% Gd3+ (x = 0, 5, 10, 15 and 20) which shows excellent luminescent properties and temperature-sensing behaviour in a temperature range of 148 K to 498 K.23 Antoniak et al. have demonstrated the use of NaBiF4:Yb,Er nanoparticles for combined temperature and pressure sensing.19 Functional characterization of NaBiF4 doped with Yb3+ and Tm3+ for biological application has not been reported so far.
UCNPs have a large surface area to volume ratio and as a result, a considerable number of dopant ions move close to the surface of the particle making the photoluminescence susceptible to quenching by surface ligands or solvent molecules.24 Several strategies have been developed to enhance the upconversion efficiency which involves (1) a core/shell structure which provides precise control over the concentration of the dopant ions in the core and shell of the nanoparticles (2) a homogeneous core/shell arrangement which forms a uniform interface between both the core and the outer shell (3) an active shell that promotes the energy transfer from the shell to the core emitters.25–27 There are very few literature reports on the quantum yield of NaYF4 and NaGdF4. The quantum yield of NaBiF4:Yb3+,Tm3+ is 2.49%. Lei et al. have reported the absolute quantum yield for NaBiF4:Yb3+,Tm3+ and NaBiF4:Yb3+,Er3+ as 2.49% and 0.22% respectively.21 Different groups have reported different values of the quantum yield for NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+ ranging from 0.005–0.3%.28 Recently Purohit et al. have reported quantum yield values for NaGd5/6Yb1/6F4:0.8% Tm3+ which ranges from 0.6% to 1.8%.29 The quantum yield of NaBiF4 is comparable with that of NaYF4 hence it serves as a good host material for upconversion.
In the present study, we report the synthesis of NaBiF4 through a non-aqueous quaternary reverse micellar route. So far to the best of our knowledge we are not aware of any synthesis through this route or any previous research that has been explored with this material for the bioimaging of cells.
When water in a usual microemulsion is replaced with a polar organic compound which is also immiscible with the nonpolar phase such systems are referred to as nonaqueous reverse micellar systems.30 Such a method allows synthesis inside the reverse-micellar core in mediums other than water. Applications in a large number of areas such as cosmetics, solar energy conversion, semiconductors and microcolloids can be encouraged.31,32
Further in this study we report the synthesis of a NaBiF4 host lattice through a non-aqueous quaternary reverse micellar route, doped with Yb3+ and Tm3+ ions. Having observed significant NIR-to-NIR as well as visible upconversion emission spectra of these submicron particles, we further assessed their biocompatibility for imaging of mammalian cancer cell lines and bacterial cells. To the best of our knowledge this is the first report on the extensive interdisciplinary analysis of Yb3+/Tm3+ doped NaBiF4 based upconversion submicron particles. This study provides viable alternatives to currently used upconversion materials and highlights their potential application as luminescent bioprobes.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials
Cetylpyridinium bromide hydrate (CPB) (Sigma Aldrich, purity >99%), bismuth nitrate pentahydrate (CDH, >99%), sodium nitrate (Fisher Scientific), ammonium fluoride (Qualigens fine Chemicals), ytterbium (III) nitrate pentahydrate (Sigma, purity 99.99%), thulium (III) chloride hexahydrate (Sigma, purity, 99.99%), and ethylene glycol (Fisher Scientific) were used. All chemicals were used as such without any further purification. The cell lines were procured from the National Centre for Cell Science (NCCS), Pune.
2.2. Synthesis of NaBiF4
NaBiF4 was synthesized by a non-aqueous quaternary reverse micellar route. For the synthesis of NaBiF4 two microemulsions (surfactant/cosurfactant/oil phase/non-aqueous polar solvent) were prepared one containing Na+ and Bi3+ ions and the other containing F− ions as reactants. The sources for the Na+, Bi3+ and F− ions were NaNO3, Bi(NO3)3·5H2O and NH4F respectively. The microemulsion system used in the synthesis consists of cetylpyridinium bromide (CPB) as the surfactant, n-butanol as the cosurfactant, cyclohexane as the hydrocarbon phase and ethylene glycol as the non-aqueous phase. A solution was prepared by dissolving 0.48 g of Bi(NO3)3·5H2O, 0.17 g of NaNO3, Yb(NO3)3·H2O (x = 20 mol%), TmCl3·6H2O (y = 0.5–4 mol%) in 25 ml of ethylene glycol. Microemulsion 1 was formed by adding 15.96 ml (depending on the WS value) of the above solution into the mixture of 8 g of CPB, 20 ml of n-butanol and 40 ml of cyclohexane. Microemulsion 2 was prepared by adding 15.96 ml of 0.5 M NH4F (in ethylene glycol) to 8 g of CPB, 20 ml of n-butanol and 40 ml of cyclohexane. The ratio of non-aqueous solvent (ethylene glycol) to surfactant was kept as WS = 12. The two microemulsions were stirred until clear solutions were obtained and then the microemulsions were mixed slowly and stirred for 30 min (Scheme S1, ESI†). The solutions were immediately centrifuged at 3000 RPM to obtain a white precipitate which was further washed with ethanol and water to remove the surfactant. The precipitate was dried overnight in an oven at 60 °C.
2.3. Synthesis of NaBiF4:Yb3+,Tm3+
NaBiF4:Yb3+,Tm3+ was synthesized by a non – aqueous quaternary reverse micellar route. For the synthesis of NaBiF4:Yb3+,Tm3+ two microemulsions (surfactant/cosurfactant/oil phase/non-aqueous polar solvent) were prepared one containing Na+, Bi3+, Yb3+ and Tm3+ ions and the other containing F− ions as the reactants. The sources for the Na+, Bi3+, Yb3+, Tm3+ and F− ions were NaNO3, Bi(NO3)3·5H2O, Yb(NO3)3·H2O (x = 20%), TmCl3·6H2O and NH4F respectively. The microemulsion system used in the synthesis consisted of cetylpyridinium bromide (CPB) as the surfactant, n-butanol as the cosurfactant, cyclohexane as the hydrocarbon phase and ethylene glycol as non-aqueous phase. A solution was prepared by dissolving (1-x-y) mmol of Bi(NO3)3·5H2O, 0.17 g of NaNO3, Yb(NO3)3·H2O (x = 20 mol%), TmCl3·6H2O (y = 0.5–4 mol%) in 25 ml of ethylene glycol. Microemulsion 1 was formed by adding 15.96 ml (depending on the WS value) of the above solution into the mixture of 8 g of CPB, 20 ml of n-butanol and 40 ml of cyclohexane. Microemulsion 2 was prepared by adding 15.96 ml of 0.5 M NH4F (in ethylene glycol) to 8 g of CPB, 20 ml of n-butanol and 40 ml of cyclohexane. The two microemulsions were stirred until clear solutions were obtained and then the microemulsions were mixed slowly and stirred for 30 min (Scheme S2, ESI†). The solutions were immediately centrifuged at 3000 RPM to obtain a white precipitate which was further washed with ethanol and water to remove the surfactant. The precipitate was dried overnight in an oven at 60 °C.
2.4. Cell culture and cytotoxicity assay
The possible cytotoxicity of NaBiF4:20% Yb3+,x% Tm3+ (x = 2, 3) was evaluated using two human cancer cell lines (Huh7: human hepatoma cell line, A549: human lung adenocarcinoma cell line) and two bacterial strains (E. coli: Gram-negative bacteria, S. aureus: Gram-positive bacteria). NaBiF4: 20% Yb3+,x% Tm3+ (x = 2, 3) submicron particles were resuspended in water and subjected to ultrasonication before adding them to the cells.
Briefly, Huh7 and A549 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's minimum essential medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) in a humidified incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2. The cells were trypsinized and then seeded in 96 well tissue culture plates at a density of 10000 cells per well. 1 day later, the culture medium was discarded, and the cells were incubated with fresh culture medium containing NaBiF4: 20% Yb3+,x% Tm3+ (x = 2, 3) at concentrations ranging from 19.25 nM to 154 nM for 24 h and 48 h. To assess the cell viability, MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) dye was added to the cells at a final concentration of 0.5 mg mL−1 per well and they were incubated for 30 minutes in the dark. The purple formazon crystals (formed by viable cells) were dissolved in DMSO (100 μL per well) and the absorbance was measured at 570 nm using a microtiter plate reader (Multiskan spectrum, Thermoscientific). 5% DMSO was used as a positive control. Experiments were performed in triplicate. The percentage cell viability was calculated using the following formula: % viability = (mean absorbance in test wells)/(mean absorbance in control well) × 100.
To monitor the growth of bacteria (E. coli and S. aureus) in the presence of the submicron particles (sample A, sample B) the bacteria were first grown overnight in Luria Bertani (LB) broth medium in a shaker incubator at 37 °C. On the subsequent day, a secondary culture was grown until it reached 0.2 OD600, and from the secondary cultures 200 μl per well was seeded in a 96 well tissue culture plate and treated with the NaBiF4: 20% Yb3+,x% Tm3+ (x = 2, 3) Tm3+ submicron particles at various concentrations (19.25 nM to 1.5 μM) in quadruplicate. OD measurements of the cultures were taken every 1 h until 8 h (until the bacterial growth reached a stationary phase) using a microtiter plate reader (Multiskan spectrum, Thermoscientific). The bacterial growth rate was assessed from a plot of OD vs time.
2.5. Confocal imaging
Huh-7 and A549 cells were grown on glass cover slips in a 6 well tissue culture plate (2 × 105 cells per well) and 24 h later a fresh culture medium containing the particles [NaBiF4:20% Yb3+,x% Tm3+ (x = 2, 3) (38.5 nM, 154 nM)] was added to the cells. 24 h later, the media was discarded, and the cells were washed with PBS to remove unbound particles. The nuclei were counterstained using Hoechst 33342 (SIGMA-Aldrich, US). The cover slips were mounted on glass slides and were imaged using an Olympus Confocal FV 1200 laser scanning fluorescence microscope (Olympus Life Sciences). The cellular uptake and the intracellular localization of the particles was visualised at 473 nm excitation using a green channel, the cell nucleus was visualised at 405 nm excitation using a blue channel at 100× magnification. E. coli and S. aureus cultures (OD600:0.2) were grown overnight in the presence of the particles [NaBiF4:20% Yb3+,2% Tm3+ (38.5 nM, 154 nM) and NaBiF4:20% Yb3+,3% Tm3+(38.5 nM, 154 nM)]. The bacterial cultures were then centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 5 minutes, the supernatant was discarded and the pellet was washed in 500 μL PBS twice to remove unbound particles. The bacterial pellet was further resuspended in PBS from which 20 μL of the bacterial suspension was smeared on a glass slide, air dried and imaged using a confocal laser scanning microscope (Olympus Confocal FV 1200). The uptake and intracellular localization of the particles was visualised at 473 nm excitation using a green channel at 100× (and 3× zoom) magnification (imaging at 980 nm excitation was beyond the scope of the laboratory).
2.6. Characterization
Powder X-ray diffraction measurements were carried out on a Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation, λ = 0.154178 nm, within a 2θ range of 10–80°. The size and surface morphology of all the samples was examined using a high resolution JEOL JSM-7800F Prime Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope. In addition to this a high-resolution transmission electron microscope (Tecnai G2 20, 200 kV) was used for the TEM images. The upconversion photoluminescence (UC PL) (steady-state and life time) studies have been performed with a custom built setup consisting of a diode laser (980 nm, 3W, CW), and a fiber optic spectrometer (QE pro), monochromator (Acton SP 2300) coupled with a photomultiplier tube (PMT) and a 200MHz Oscilloscope (TDS).
3. Results
3.1. Structural and morphological investigations
The NaBiF4 submicron particles were characterized using powder X-ray diffraction. Fig. 1 clearly indicates that all the observed diffraction peaks are consistent with the standard hexagonal phase of NaBiF4, and no peaks of any secondary phase were observed.20 For all the samples of NaBiF4:Yb3+,Tm3+ a shift in the peaks was observed towards higher 2θ values due to the substitution of the Bi3+ ion by the smaller Yb3+ and Tm3+ ions in the host lattice, and as a result shrinkage in the cell volume occurs. Fig. S1 (ESI†) shows the PXRD Rietveld refinement of the NaBiF4 submicron particles and the obtained parameters are shown in Table S1 (ESI†).

Fig. S2(a–f) (ESI†) summarizes the morphological properties of the NaBiF4 and NaBiF4:Yb3+,Tm3+ sub-micron particles respectively The surface morphology of the NaBiF4 and NaBiF4:Yb3+,Tm3+ phosphors was investigated using field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM). Fig. S2 in the ESI† shows the formation of spherical particles with an average diameter of ∼200 ± 50 nm. The distribution of the particles was statistically analyzed by means of the FE-SEM and TEM images on 30 particles evidencing an average size of about ∼200 nm. NaBiF4 and NaBiF4:Yb3+,Tm3+ phosphors with various Tm3+ ion concentrations exhibit similar morphologies and size distribution, implying that the morphology and particle size of the NaBiF4:Yb3+,Tm3+ sample were almost independent of the Tm3+ content. The presence of all the elements was confirmed by elemental mapping in the FESEM, (Fig. S3(a–d), ESI†) showing the homogenous distribution of all the elements in the submicron particles. The morphology and structure were further confirmed by HRTEM which further confirms that the synthesized particles are spherical in shape with an average size of ∼200 nm (Fig. 2a). The HRTEM results were consistent with the FESEM results. Moreover, the HR-TEM images exhibit lattice fringes with a fringe width of 0.306 nm, which is in good agreement with the (110) plane of the hexagonal phase of NaBiF4 (Fig. 2b).

To investigate the long-term stability, the zeta potential values of the submicron particles were measured in PBS (pH = 7.4) and 0.9% NaCl saline solution at different time intervals. Lü et al. have reported that the colloidal system with a zeta potential of ±25 mV is stable and, in this case, there is an absence of coagulation.33,34 As shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†) the zeta potential values of NaBiF4:20%Yb3+,2% Tm3+ in PBS solution are −26.0, −25.7 and −25.6 mV at 0 min, after 24 h and after 48 h respectively. Whereas figure S shows the zeta potential values of NaBiF4:20%Yb3+,3% Tm3+ in 0.9% NaCl saline solution are −28.9, −28.8 and −28.6 mV at 0 min, after 24 h and after 48 h respectively. These results show significant stability even after 48 h.
3.2. Studies of upconversion photoluminescence and the energy transfer mechanism
In this work, the upconversion emission spectra of NaBiF4 phosphors codoped with Tm3+–Yb3+ in different dopant proportions have been investigated in detail. Upon excitation by a continuous wave (CW) diode laser at 980 nm with laser powers varying from 140 mW to 360 mW which is depicted in Fig. 3(b–d), three UC emission bands were found: two bands in the blue (450–475 nm) region (1D2 → 3F4), (1G4 → 3H6), two bands in the red (650, 695 nm) region (1G4 → 3F4, 3F2,3 → 3H6) and one band in the NIR region (798 nm) 3H4 → 3H6. The upconversion intensity increased with an increase in the amount of the Tm3+ ions (up to 3%) and then decreased further with an increase in the amount of Tm3+ ion (4%) (Fig. 3a). In this work, the best doped concentration of Tm3+ ions is 3% however in the conventional hosts such as NaYF4 studies have been done with 0.5% Tm3+.35 This significant difference could be attributed to the dissimilar crystal-field surroundings of Yb3+ and Tm3+ ions in the NaYF4 and NaBiF4 host lattice. The ionic radii of the Bi3+ ion are different from the Y3+ ion (Bi3+ ionic radius is 1.03 Å and Y3+ ionic radius is 0.89 Å), and as a result it brings significant modifications in the local environment of the Yb3+ and Tm3+ ions in the lattice. These modifications in the local environment increase the probability of the radiative transition rate and as a result an enhancement in the emission intensity is observed.
 Fig. 3  NIR to visible UC PL spectra of NaBiF4:20% Yb3+,(0.5–4%) Tm3+ submicron particles for excitation at 980 nm and 360 mW laser power (a) and laser power dependence PL emission spectra under 980nm CW diode laser excitation (b–d). 
The initial increase in the UC emission intensity is due to the step-by-step energy transfer process, which results in an increase in the population of the Tm3+ ions in the excited state. On the other hand the subsequent decrease in the UC emission intensity can be correlated with the increased cross-relaxation process which leads to depopulation of the Tm3+ ions in the excited state. Another interesting thing is that a strong NIR-to-NIR upconversion is observed as compared to emission in the visible region. This is possibly due to a cross relaxation process (1G4 + 3F4 → 3H4 + 3F2) which becomes more efficient with the increase in amount of Tm3+ ions leading to an enhanced population of the 3H4 state. As a result, a sharp NIR emission of high intensity and suppressed visible emissions are observed. The mechanism of upconversion emission can be understood using a schematic energy level diagram (Scheme 1). Yb3+ ions have a large absorption cross-section around 980 nm. Under 980 nm excitation Yb3+ ions are excited from the ground state (2F7/2) to the excited state (2F5/2) and they transfer energy to the neighbouring Tm3+ ions. As a result, four successive energy transfer processes occur resulting in the population of the 3H5, 3F2, 1G4, and 1D2 states of the Tm3+ ions. The Tm3+ ions are excited from the ground state 3H6 to the 3H5 state by the energy transfer process (ET-1), from which it decays non-radiatively to the 3F4 state. Population of the 3F4 state is promoted to the 3F2,3 state by the ET-2 process, from which non-radiative relaxation occurs to the 3H4 state. A part of the population from the 3H4 state is depopulated by emission of a photon in the NIR region corresponding to the transition 3H4 → 3H6. The remaining part of the population is promoted from the 3H4 state to the 1G4 state via ET-3. From the 1G4 state radiative as well as non-radiative relaxations occur. Radiative relaxation give rise to transitions in the blue 1G4 → 3H6 (475 nm) and red region 1G4 → 3F4 (650 nm). A non-radiative transition occurs from the 1G4 state to the 3F2,3 state from where it emits a photon corresponding to the transition 3F2,3 → 3H6 state at 695 nm. From the energy level diagram of Yb3+, Tm3+ we can say that blue and red emission bands are attributed to three-photon absorption process, whereas the NIR band is due to two photon absorption process.

As the mechanism suggests a three-photon excitation process, especially for blue and red emission, it is necessary to determine the actual number of photons involved in the upconversion process for each emission. The pump power dependence on the UC emission study has been performed for the NaBiF4:20% Yb3+,2% Tm3+ phosphors to investigate the number of photons involved. Fig. 4 shows the ln{UC emission intensity} versus ln{pump power} for the Yb3+, Tm3+ doped NaBiF4 phosphors. The formula relating the emission intensity of the UC bands is I∝Pn, where I is the UC emission intensity corresponding to a band, P is the laser pump power and n is the number of photons responsible for this upconversion process.36 Hence, the slope of the double logarithmic plot of the emission intensities by laser pump power is correlated to the number of photons involved in the transitions. The slope corresponding to the blue, red and NIR bands are 3.18, 2.37 and 1.96 respectively. The deviation in these values from the theoretical values is due to saturation effects and high energy losses (energy transfer process, non-radiative relaxation, and cooperative sensitization). The relationship between UC emission intensity and the pump power of the laser is valid only at lower excitation powers. Since upconversion is a non-linear process and the intensity of the emission bands depends not only on the concentration of the dopants but also on the temperature as a result exposure to high power densities may lead to saturation of the upconversion process and non-viability of its non-linear behaviour.37 Quantum yield measurements were performed for NaBiF4:20% Yb3+,(0.5–4%) Tm3+ using a diode laser with an excitation power of 100 mW at a wavelength of 980 nm (Table S2, ESI†).

3.3. Upconversion photoluminescence decay kinetics
UC PL lifetime measurements of all the samples with emission at 475 nm and 798 nm upon excitation by a 980 nm CW diode laser with a power of 200 mW were plotted as shown in Fig. 5. The decay curves were fit satisfactorily to a bi-exponential function as shown in Table 1. For all the samples τ1 is dominating. Deviation from the single exponential nature may be due to the ionic interactions which occur in the host lattice.

3.4. Effect of NaBiF4:Yb3+,Tm3+ on viability of human cancer cell lines
The cell viability assay (MTT assay) demonstrates that NaBiF4: 20% Yb3+,2% Tm3+ does not affect the viability of Huh7 cells but is associated with minor (<5%) cytotoxicity in A549 cells when incubated at the concentration range 19 nM to 154 nM at the 48 h time point. NaBiF4 20% Yb3+,3% Tm3+ appears to be more cytotoxic (5–20%) for both Huh7 and A549 cells compared to NaBiF4: 20% Yb3+,2% Tm3+ (Fig. 6 and 7). The results show that concentrations of up to 154 nM and lower concentrations of NaBiF4: 20% Yb3+,3% Tm3+ (77 nM) may be suitable for use as potential luminescent probes for cancer cell imaging.
 Fig. 6  Cell viability of Huh-7 and A549 cells determined using the MTT assay at varying concentrations of NaBiF4:20% Yb3+,2% Tm3+ and NaBiF4:20% Yb3+,3% Tm3+. The bar graphs represent mean (±SD) of three independent experiments. 
 Fig. 7  Bacterial growth curve to assess the cytotoxic effect of NaBiF4:20% Yb3+,2% Tm3+ and NaBiF4:20% Yb3+,3% Tm3+ in Gram negative (a and b) and Gram positive (c and d) bacteria. The data is representative of three independent experiments. 
3.5. Effect of NaBiF4:Yb3+,Tm3+ on growth of Gram positive and Gram-negative bacteria
NaBiF4:20% Yb3+,2% Tm3+ and NaBiF4:20% Yb3+,3% Tm3+ do not show any inhibitory effect on the growth of both Gram-negative [E. coli (DH5α strain)] and Gram-positive [S. aureus] bacteria when incubated at the concentration range 19 nM to 1.5 μM for 8 h at 37 °C (Fig. 7). Thus, indicating that NaBiF4:Yb3+,Tm3+ submicron particles are not cytotoxic to bacteria even at low micromolar concentrations.
3.6. Bioimaging and cellular uptake of NaBiF4:Yb3+,Tm3+ in human cancer cell lines, Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria
To determine the potential application of the designed NaBiF4:Yb3+,Tm3+ submicron particles as luminescent probes, the cellular uptake and intracellular localization of NaBiF4:20% Yb3+,2% Tm3+ and NaBiF4:20% Yb3+,3% Tm3+ was visualized using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) in human cancer cell lines (Huh7, A549). As shown in Fig. 8 and 9 the green florescence observed in Huh7 and A549 cells (Fig. 9) indicate the effective cellular uptake of the NaBiF4:Yb3+,Tm3+ submicron particles. The overlay of the green and blue (nucleus stained with Hoechst 33342) emission images indicate clear cytoplasmic localisation of the aggregated particles. There is a dose-dependent decrease in the fluorescence intensity with a decrease in the concentration of the submicron particles. These results indicate that the particles demonstrate good permeability in growing human cancer cell lines (Huh7 and A549) and therefore no additional permeabilization or fixation steps were required for bioimaging.
 Fig. 8  Confocal laser scanning microscopy images of unfixed human cancer cell lines Huh7 and A549 incubated with NaBiF4:Yb3+,Tm3+ variants after 24 h using 473 nm laser excitation. Magnification: 100×. Scale bar = 20 μm. 
 Fig. 9  Confocal laser scanning microscopy images of Gram negative (E. coli) and Gram positive (S. aureus) bacterial strains incubated with NaBiF4:20% Yb3+,x% Tm3+ [x = 2–4] after 12 h using 473 nm laser excitation. The NaBiF4:Yb3+,Tm3+ submicron particles show green emission (a, d, g and j), and the green channel images overlayed with the DIC image show cellular internalization of the submicron particles (b, e, h and k). Overlayed images at 3x zoom are also shown (c, f, i and l). Magnification: 100×, Scale bar = 20 μm. For images taken at 3× zoom scale bar = 5 μm. 
While it is clear that the submicron particles are internalized into the cytoplasm of human cancer cells, the underlying mechanism remains to be elucidated. The recent development of multifunctional nanomaterials which can function both as a “drug carrier” as well as a “bioprobe” have drawn considerable attention for their dual capability of treatment as well as for cancer surveillance. For example, Zhu et al. have developed water-soluble NaLnF4@MOF-Ln nanocomposites with dual-mode luminescence, which is based on Stokes luminescent mesoporous lanthanide metal–organic frameworks (MOFs-Y:Eu3+) and anti-Stokes luminescent NaYF4:Yb3+/Tm3+nanoparticles, capable of carrying the anticancer drug doxorubicin hydrochloride (DOX) for delivery in-vitro (in the HeLa cell line).38 Bao et al. have discussed the coupling of upconversion nanoparticles with photosensitisers to confer increased efficiency and working depth in cancer photodynamic therapies.39 Our findings suggest that in addition to imaging, low-phonon energy fluoride particles may be explored for potential applications in drug delivery as well. Additional applications of these materials including drug delivery merit further investigation.
As shown in Fig. 9, both the NaBiF4:20% Yb3+,2% Tm3+ and NaBiF4:20% Yb3+,3% Tm3+ demonstrate significantly greater intracellular uptake in Gram negative bacteria (E. coli: DH5α), compared to that in Gram positive bacteria (S. aureus). These results also indicate that NaBiF4:20% Yb3+,2% Tm3+, 154 nM exhibits brighter fluorescence as compared to NaBiF4:20% Yb3+,3% Tm3+.
Conclusions
NaBiF4:20% Yb3+,x% Tm3+ [x = 0.5–4%] UC submicron particles were synthesised by a non-aqueous reverse micelle route. This method of synthesis could be of interest to the research community where synthesis occurs inside a core other than water. As there are already many reports on the synthesis of nanoparticles through aqueous reverse micelles, this route needs to be explored more as it provides a new approach. Observed intense UC PL emission bands in the NIR and visible spectrum upon excitation by a CW diode laser at 980 nm. We further explored the biocompatibility of the NaBiF4 phosphors codoped with Yb3+/Tm3+ using cytotoxicity assays and bioimaging efficiency in human cancer cell lines (Huh-7 and A549) as well as in bacterial strains (Gram-negative: E. coli, Gram-positive: S. aureus) using confocal microscopy. Collectively, our results functionally validate NaBiF4:Yb3+,x% Tm3+ [x = 2–3] as biocompatible luminescent particles and their potential application for bioimaging of both mammalian as well as bacterial cells. These submicron particles may serve as an eco-friendly and a cost-effective alternative to conventionally used probes. Additional applications of these materials including drug delivery merit further investigation.
