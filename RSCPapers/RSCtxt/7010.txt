    , Accepted 8th October 2018First published on 10th October 2018AbstractAs a newly-rising member in the perovskite family of solar cell absorbers, the lead-free halide double perovskites Cs2M+M3+X6 (X = Cl, Br, I), with suitable bandgaps in the visible-light region and intrinsic thermodynamic stability, pave a new way in designing environmentally friendly perovskite solar cell devices. Here, for the first time, we optimize 24 kinds of layered Ruddlesden–Popper (RP) type n = 1–3 Csn+1Mn/2+Mn/23+X3n+1 (M+: In+, Cu+, Ag+, Au+; M3+: Bi3+, Sb3+) and investigate their electronic, optical and transport properties based on powerful first-principles and GW-BSE calculations. Surprisingly, we find that Cs4In3/2Sb3/2I10 (n = 3) has a direct bandgap of 1.29 eV, a very suitable value for visible-light absorption and emission. In order to modulate the bandgap and charge distribution, we further construct 7 two-dimensional halide double perovskite heterostructures with direct bandgaps and type-II band alignment, leading to a remarkable spatial separation of photo-generated carriers and a noticeable reduction of the carrier recombination rate, which is beneficial for photovoltaic devices. Typically, the Cs4In3/2Sb3/2Cl10/Cs2Cu1/2Bi1/2Cl4 heterostructure has a direct bandgap of 1.65 eV with a great electron–hole spatial separation. Both the different layered CsInSbI perovskites and CsInSbCl/CsCuBiCl-based heterostructures have an ultrahigh absorption coefficient of ∼105 cm−1 in the visible-light region, which is comparable with bulk MAPbI3. Moreover, their electron and hole mobilities are three/four orders of magnitude larger than MAPbI3 up to 102–103 cm2 V−1 s−1. The novel properties of the suitable bandgap, spatial separation of carriers, excellent absorption coefficient and extremely high carrier mobility suggest that the 2D layered RP-type CsInSbI- and CsInSbCl/CsCuBiCl-based perovskites have great potential as promising lead-free solar cell absorbers and solid-state-lighting materials.
Introduction
Hybrid organic–inorganic halide perovskite semiconductors have attracted widespread attention recently due to their remarkable optoelectronic properties for device applications, such as photovoltaic and solid-state-lighting devices, especially the lead (Pb)-based perovskite materials MAPbX3 and FAPbX3 [MA = CH3NH3+; FA = HC(NH2)2+; X = Cl−, Br−, I−].1–5 The Pb-based halide perovskites have revolutionized the field of solution processable solar cells, achieving a certified record power conversion efficiency (PCE) up to 23.3% quite recently, which has surpassed multicrystalline (22.3%) and thin-film silicon photovoltaic devices (21.2%).6 Lead halide perovskites have many advanced properties, such as a low cost fabrication process,7 remarkable light absorption in the visible-light region,8 and long diffusion length of the photo-generated carriers,9 as well as the ability to recycle the photons emitted upon radiative recombination.10 However, despite these attractive merits, lead hailde perovskite solar cells are still facing severe challenges, i.e., the presence of toxic element Pb and the poor stability upon long-time exposure to light, humidity and increased temperature.11–15 Therefore, looking for non-toxic, environmentally friendly and more stable perovskite solar cell absorber materials has attracted much attention and become a current research hotspot.
Recently, the emerging two-dimensional (2D) perovskites are attractive due to their long carrier lifetime, high photoluminescence (PL) quantum efficiency, widely tunable bandgap, high carrier mobility and great defect tolerance.16–18 More importantly, 2D perovskites have greater structural stability than their 3D counterparts due to the moisture resistance imposed by the hydrophobic organic molecules at the surface, making them more promising for large-scale industrial implementation.19–21 The 2D halide perovskites can be easily obtained by mechanical exfoliation,22 solution-processing synthesis23 or a colloidal engineering method.24 The first solar cell device with n = 3 perovskite (C6H5(CH2)2NH3)2(CH3NH3)2Pb3I10 showed a PCE of 4.73% under ambient conditions without encapsulation and the perovskite structure can keep well for 40 days exposed to 52% relative humidity.21 Li et al. adopted the colloidal strategy to prepare a 2D MAPbI3 film and achieved a high PCE of 19.14%.24 Tsai et al. synthesized a Ruddlesden–Popper (RP) type n = 4 (BA)2(MA)3Pb4I13 perovskite with an increased PCE of 12.5%.25 Liao et al. found that unencapsulated 2D Sn-based perovskite solar cells showed no appreciable decay in efficiency (∼5.94%) over 100 hours.19 Quite recently, 2D RP-type lead-free and highly stable Cu- and Ge-based perovskites, i.e., (C6H5CH2NH3)2CuBr426 and (C6H5C2H4NH3)2GeI4,27 have also been successfully synthesized in experiments. The layer thickness provides a direct way to optimize the performance of perovskite absorbers. Large n means better sunlight absorption and higher carrier mobility, while small n provides better moisture resistance and higher quality films. Moreover, 2D perovskites are also promising in solid-state-lighting fields, such as light-emitting diode (LED) devices, due to their excellent light absorption and emission and widely-tunable bandgaps. LEDs based on 2D halide perovskites have been fabricated recently with energy conversion efficiency ∼7%.28
Although lots of advantages exist in 2D perovskites as solar cell absorber materials, there is still an urgent issue to be solved, i.e., the toxicity of Pb. In order to remove the toxic element, researchers have proposed to replace Pb2+ by the same family elements, such as Sn2+ and Ge2+. The strategy of using Sn and Ge has so far been unsuccessful due to the tendency of Sn and Ge to oxidize in the +4 state rather than the desired 2+ state, which directly leads to the unstable structure of Sn- and Ge-based perovskites, resulting in relatively low device performance and reproducibility.29,30 Quite recently, four independent groups have reported simultaneously the successful replacement of Pb via heterovalent substitution with Bi and Ag,31–35 so as to form a halide double perovskite. The computational design of a new halide double perovskite family with bulk phase Cs2M+M3+X6 (M+ = In+, Cu+, Ag+, Au+; M3+ = Sb3+, Bi3+ and X = Cl, Br, I) has been proposed.31,34 Zhao et al. have confirmed the good phase and structural stability against decomposition of these perovskite materials through theoretical calculations. The bandgaps, optical properties and carrier effective masses can also be highly tunable according to the diversified combination of M+, M3+ and X.31 Recently, three members of the lead-free double perovskites, i.e., Cs2AgBiCl6, Cs2AgBiBr6 and Cs2AgInCl6, have been successfully synthesized experimentally.33–35 The devices based on Cs2AgBiBr6 film present a PCE of 1.44% and have high stability under ambient air and light without encapsulation.36 Besides the fully-inorganic double perovskites, the hybrid organic–inorganic halide double perovskite (CH3NH3)2BiKCl6 was also synthesized,37 which further expands the potential for material design of lead-free double perovskites. It is interesting to note that all theoretical and experimental investigations are focused on bulk perovskites, while 2D double perovskites are still absent up to now.
In this work, we adopt first-principles calculations within density functional theory (DFT) and advanced many-body perturbation theory to explore the electronic, optical and transport properties of 2D layered RP-type lead-free halide double perovskites Csn+1Mn/2+Mn/23+X3n+1 (M+: In+, Cu+, Ag+, Au+; M3+: Bi3+, Sb3+; X: Cl, Br and I) and their heterostructures for the first time. Surprisingly, we find that the layered Csn+1Inn/2Sbn/2I3n+1 perovskites are direct bandgap semiconductors with bandgaps of 1.55, 1.37 and 1.29 eV for n = 1–3, which are very suitable for visible-light absorption and smaller than the bandgap of MAPbI3 (∼1.50–1.61 eV).2,4,38 The type-II band alignment of the Cs4In3/2Sb3/2Cl10/Cs2Cu1/2Bi1/2Cl4 heterostructure, with a direct bandgap of 1.65 eV, leads to the significant spatial separation of photo-generated carriers, which results in a low carrier recombination rate. The energy gap can be further reduced by increasing the layer thickness. Both CsInSbI and CsInSbCl/CsCuBiCl have an ultrahigh absorption coefficient (∼105 cm−1), as high as MAPbI3. The exciton binding energy of ∼0.30 eV is suitable and favourable for LED devices and can be greatly reduced to several meV by a high-k dielectric transport layer in solar cell devices. Both the electron and hole mobility are three/four orders of magnitude larger than MAPbI3 up to 102–103 cm2 V−1 s−1 for all layered and heterostructure perovskites. Our results of 2D RP-type lead-free halide double perovskites offer useful guidance for selectively utilizing these stable and environmentally friendly halide perovskites as promising solar absorbers and solid-state-lighting materials. The layered CsInSbI and CsInSbCl/CsCuBiCl heterostructures are thus favourable optoelectronic candidates.
Computational methods
DFT and GW calculations
Our first-principles calculations are carried out within the framework of DFT using the projector augmented wave (PAW)39 method as implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) code.40 The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) formulated by Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE)41 is used as the exchange correlation functional. An energy cutoff of 500 eV is set for the plane-wave expansion. All the cubic double perovskites are relaxed by total energy minimization by the conjugated gradient algorithm and the convergence tolerances of energy and residual atomic forces are smaller than 10−5 eV and 10−3 eV Å−1. The k-point mesh is sampled by 13 × 13 × 1 for structure optimization and 15 × 15 × 1 for self-consistent calculation in the first Brillouin zone. The vacuum spacing of 20 Å is chosen along the c-axis to avoid spurious interaction between the periodically repeated units. Considering the severe underestimation of semiconductor bandgaps in common DFT-PBE calculations, we adopted the GGA-1/2 scheme42,43 to revise the bandgap to an accurate value compared with experiments and time-consuming GW calculations with a comparable computational cost to the ordinary GGA-PBE calculations. Moreover, we used the BerkeleyGW package44 to perform the GW calculations of electronic structure and to solve the Bethe–Salpeter equation (BSE) for the absorption spectrum. For the quasiparticle calculations, the ground-state Kohn–Sham wave functions and eigenvalues are obtained using the Troullier–Martins norm-conserving pseudopotenetials,45,46 as implemented in QUANTUM ESPRESSO code.47 The kinetic energy cutoff of 60 Ry is used for the wave function and a 13 × 13 × 1 k-point mesh is chosen during the GW calculations. To perform the BSE calculations, we interpolate the electron–hole interaction kernel on a 21 × 21 × 1 k-point mesh. This choice of parameters yields well-converged exciton eigenenergies and sufficient accuracy in our calculations.
GGA-1/2 bandgap calculation
In the GGA-1/2 scheme,42,43 the atomic self-energy potential is expressed as the difference between the all-electron potentials of the atom and those of the half-ion, Vs ≈ V(0,r) − V(−1/2,r).(1)The half ionization is applied to the outermost orbital of X, M+ and M3+ atoms. The potential Vs has a long-range Coulomb tail that has to be trimmed by means of a function, (2)The values of CUT (a.u.) and l are chosen such that the resulting energy bandgap of the crystal reaches its extreme. The values of CUT and l are further tested by means of a comparison of the resulting energy bandgap with experimental or GW values. We note from Fig. 5 of ref. 43 that, for some important semiconductors, such as Si, Ge, GaAs, GaN and ZnO, the bandgap energies derived from the GGA-1/2 method (1.137, 0.70, 1.41, 3.52 and 3.29 eV) are in excellent agreement with experimental (1.17, 0.66–0.74, 1.519, 3.507 and 3.4 eV) and GW calculation results (0.95–1.10, 0.66–0.83, 1.40–1.70, 3.15–3.47 and 2.51–3.07 eV), although they are obtained at a comparable computational cost to that of ordinary GGA-PBE calculations. Moreover, several recent calculations have confirmed that the GGA-1/2 method can give an accurate bandgap for ABX3-type metal halide perovskites.48–50 In our current GGA-1/2 calculations, the tested parameters CUT and l are summarized in Table S1 (ESI†) for halide double perovskites. Furthermore, the dependence of the GGA-1/2 bandgap on the half-ionized orbitals of metal atoms in Cs2In1/2Sb1/2I4 and Cs2Cu1/2Bi1/2Cl4, a typical representative of our halide double perovskites, is shown in Table S2 (ESI†). We can find that our CUT values for X− in 2D Csn+1Mn/2+Mn/23+X3n+1 halide double perovskites are slightly smaller than those of ref. 48–50 (3.12, 3.34 and 3.76 for Cl−, Br− and I−) in ABX3-type perovskites. This is because the anion CUT value usually has a small dependence on the chemical environment, as pointed out by Ferreira et al.42
Carrier mobility
Generally, the carrier mobility μ2D of a 2D semiconductor can be easily calculated by means of the deformation potential (DP) theory proposed by Bardeen and Shockley,51 where the acoustic phonons, especially the long-wavelength acoustic phonons, are recognized as the most important scattering mechanism. It means that the atomic displacement associated with long-wavelength acoustic phonons leads to a deformation of the crystal and a shift of the electronic energy dispersion. According to the DP theory and Boltzmann transport theory,52 the μ2D can be expressed as follows,53–55 (3)where T is the temperature, and m* = ħ2[∂2E(k)/∂k2]−1 is the carrier effective mass, determined by the curvature of energy dispersion at the band edge, along the particular transport direction. The term E1 is the DP constant defined by E1 = [∂Eedge/∂δ], which denotes the shift of the band edge (the CBM for electrons and the VBM for holes) induced by strain δ. Here, Eedge is the energy of the CBM or VBM under proper lattice compression or dilatation. The in-plane stiffness is defined as C2D = [∂2Etot/∂δ2]/S0, where Etot is the total energy and S0 is the area of the optimized supercell.
It is worthwhile to note that eqn (3) is originally derived from ref. 51, which is just suitable for non-polar materials, such as graphene and phosphorene. According to the DP theory, the carrier mobility is mainly determined by the long-wavelength acoustic phonons, the most important scattering source, and the other scattering mechanisms, for example, impurity and defect scattering, are neglected. Generally, an overestimated mobility can be expected from eqn (3). Quite recently, we proved that eqn (3) is also suitable to predict the carrier mobility in 2D polar semiconductors, such as InSe, because the contribution of polar optical phonons, compared with the long-wavelength acoustic phonons, can be ignored due to the negligible phonon number  = (eħω/kBT − 1)−1 with a phonon wavenumber of 0 at room temperature.56 Hence, eqn (3) has been widely adopted to calculate the carrier mobility in lots of 2D polar semiconductors, such as MoS2,54 GeSe,57 SnS57 and 2D heterostructures.57,58 These calculations show that the carrier mobility derived from eqn (3) is in agreement with experiments. The predicted mobility increase with thickness of 2D semiconductors is also confirmed by experiments.54,56–59 Therefore, eqn (3) is usually used to calculate the carrier mobility of 2D semiconductors due to their strong in-plane electron/hole-phonon interaction. We thus believe that eqn (3) is suitable to calculate the carrier mobility in 2D lead-free halide perovskites.
Results and discussion
Crystal structure and stability of 2D RP-type lead-free halide double perovskites
In order to completely eliminate the toxicity from the Pb element, Zhao et al. proposed the transmutation of two divalent Pb2+ ions into a monovalent metal ion M+ and a trivalent metal ion M3+, i.e., 2Pb2+ → M+ + M3+, to build bulk lead-free double perovskites with a chemical formula of A2M+M3+X6.31,60 It forms alternative M+X3 and M3+X3 octahedrons to keep the total number of valence electrons unchanged from the 2Pb2+X3 octahedron. Here, we consider the 2D layered RP-type lead-free halide double perovskites, composed by different layer thicknesses of octahedrons, as shown in Fig. 1. In order to maintain the structural stability of the octahedron, the available choices of M+ and M3+ are size-suitable elements, which have a similar ionic radius to Pb2+. Compatible with lead, suitable M+ can be chosen as In+, Ag+, Cu+, Au+, and TI+ and M3+ can be Bi3+ and Sb3+. Considering the severer toxicity of TI+ than Pb2+, we have removed TI+ directly without further consideration. The large radius inorganic cation Cs+ can be adopted at the A site to stabilize the perovskite structure. Based on this transmutation, we construct and optimize 24 kinds of n = 1 Cs2M1/2+M1/23+X4 perovskites. Their fully-relaxed lattice parameters are summarized in Table S3 (ESI†).
 Fig. 1  The conventional unit cell of 2D layered RP-type lead-free halide double perovskite Csn+1Mn/2+Mn/23+X3n+1 with octahedron layer numbers n = 1 and n = 2. The green, blue, pink and brown spheres represent Cs+, monovalent metal (M+), trivalent metal (M3+) and halogen (X = Cl−, Br− and I−) ions, respectively. The black arrow above the top view image indicates the x direction, which is also the carrier transport direction in our following effective mass and mobility calculations. 
In order to evaluate the crystallographic stability of the perovskite structure, two empirical parameters, i.e., the Goldschmidt tolerance factor t and octahedral factor μ, are calculated. It is well-known that all the existing halide perovskites have good formability if 0.8 ≤ t ≤ 1.0 and 0.44 ≤ μ ≤ 0.90,16 which can be used as a guideline to choose suitable transmuted elements for designing new perovskite structures. For the aforementioned lead-free halide double perovskites, the Goldschmidt tolerance factor t and octahedral factor μ can be defined as, (4) μ = (RM+ + RM3+)/2RX,(5)where RA, RM+, RM3+ and RX are the ionic radii of A, M+, M3+ and X ions, respectively. The t and μ values for our 24 double perovskites are shown in Table 1. We can find that all CsM+M3+X perovskites fall into the stable region. This clearly indicates that the combination of these M+ and M3+ atoms can give stable octahedral perovskite structures. Moreover, we also calculate the binding energy (Eb) per atom for all chosen double perovskites to evaluate their thermodynamic stability and compare it with some synthesized 2D materials. Here, the binding energy Eb is defined as Eb = (kECs + lEM+ + mEM3+ + nEX − ECs2M+M3+X6)/(k + l + m + n), in which ECs, EM+, EM3+, EX and ECs2M+M3+X6 are the total energies of each Cs, M+, M3+, X and Cs2M+M3+X6 molecule, and k, l, m and n are the number of corresponding atoms, respectively. The stability of different perovskites can be evaluated by comparing their binding energies, in which large Eb means a more stable structure. We can find from Table 1 that the binding energies of most double perovskites are about 30–80 meV per atom, which is actually close to the binding energy of some well-known 2D materials, such as graphene (∼60 meV per atom61,62), transition metal dichalcogenides (∼50 meV per atom63) and InSe (∼50 meV per atom64). Moreover, the values of t, μ and Eb decrease monotonically as X changes from Cl and Br to I. This will directly lead to low structural stability due to the large atomic radius of Br and I ions. The previous phonon spectra calculations clearly show that no imaginary frequency phonon modes exist in Cs2M+M3+X6,31 which confirms their structural stability. We also note that bulk Cs2AgBiCl6 and Cs2AgBiBr6 have been synthesized successfully in experiments.65
Table 1 The calculated Goldschmidt tolerance factor t, octahedral factor μ and binding energy Eb (in units of meV per atom) for Cs2M1/2+M1/23+X4 (M+ = In+, Ag+, Cu+, Au+; M3+ = Bi3+, Sb3+; X = Cl, Br and I) lead-free halide double perovskites. Both 0.81 ≤ t ≤ 0.99 and Eb ∼ 20–100 meV per atom clearly show that the chosen Cs2M1/2+M1/23+X4 are stable

Electronic structure
Let us now investigate the basic electronic structures of 2D lead-free Csn+1Mn/2+Mn/23+X3n+1 halide double perovskites (see Fig. 2 and Fig. S1, S2, ESI†). The energy band structures are calculated by using the accurate GW method in Fig. 2 and GGA-1/2 modulation of the PBE energy dispersion in Fig. S1 and S2 (ESI†) because the electronic band structures derived from PBE calculations with GGA-1/2 bandgap modification are in excellent agreement with the accurate and time-consuming GW calculations.56,66 On the basis of the bandgap characters, 24 candidates can be naturally classified into two types: 12 direct bandgap perovskites with monovalent metal ions In+ and Cu+ and the other 12 indirect ones with monovalent metal ions Ag+ and Au+. The In+- and Cu+-based direct bandgap perovskites have great potential in photovoltaic and solid-state-lighting devices due to their excellent optical absorption. We can easily find from Fig. 2 and Fig. S1, S2 (ESI†) that the direct or indirect bandgap characteristics are determined by M+, while Bi3+ and Sb3+ ions dominate the gap value. Cs+ mainly contributes to the deep energy level and has no contribution to the band edge state. Surprisingly, we find that Cs2In1/2Sb1/2I4 has a direct bandgap of 1.55 eV, in which both the conduction band minimum (CBM) and valence band maximum (VBM) locate at the Γ-point (see Fig. 2a) with a sharp dispersion curve at the band edge. The sharp E–k curves will directly result in a small carrier effective mass, i.e., 0.18 (0.70) m0 for holes (electrons) along the Γ–X direction (see Table 2), which is obviously smaller than that of MAPbI3 (0.30 and 1.14 m0). Hence, Cs2In1/2Sb1/2I4 has a great carrier mobility of 655 (308) cm2 V−1 s−1 for holes (electrons).

The remaining six band structures and PDOSs of I-based perovskites are shown in Fig. S1 and S2 (ESI†). As the halogen atom changes from Cl to I, both the electronic energy bands and PDOSs are similar to the corresponding I-based perovskites and are thus not shown here, while the bandgap decreases monotonically. Here, the band structures are derived from the accurate GW calculations. It is worthwhile to note that, similar to MAPbI3, Cs2In1/2Sb1/2I4 has a direct bandgap of 1.55 eV, which is highly desirable for solar cell absorbers.

The orbital partial density of states (PDOSs) and isosurface charge density distributions show that the VBM of Cs2In1/2Sb1/2I4 is mainly formed by In 5s and I 5pxy orbitals, while the CBM is dominated by the Sb 5s orbital (see Fig. 2a and c). The orbital contributions of the In-based double perovskite are analogous to MAPbI3.67,68 Previous works have confirmed that MAPbI3 is a direct bandgap semiconductor with gap value ∼1.50–1.61 eV, in which its VBM is determined by Pb 6s and I 5p orbitals and the CBM is mainly contributed by Pb 6p orbitals and the organic ion (MA+) has no contribution to the band edge state.69 Comparing Cs2In1/2Sb1/2I4 with MAPbI3, we can find that the lone pair s-electrons of Pb2+ in MAPbI3 are equally substituted by In+ in Cs2In1/2Sb1/2I4. It has been well-known that Pb is the key element and plays an important role in conventional perovskite solar cell materials with direct bandgaps, excellent optical absorption coefficients and high PCE due to the strong coupling between the Pb s state and the p state of the anion. Hence, we believe that the direct bandgap In-based double perovskites are promising as new solar cell absorber materials. On the contrary, the indirect bandgap Cs2Ag1/2Sb1/2I4 has a relatively large electronic bandgap of 2.35 eV with the VBM at the Γ-point and the CBM at the X-point (Fig. 2b). The PDOSs clearly show that, different from Cs2In1/2Sb1/2I4, the VBM is a hybridized state of Ag 4d and I 5pxy orbitals, and the CBM is determined by 5pxy orbitals of Sb and I atoms (see Fig. 2b and d). The energy band dispersion curves are more flat leading to a larger carrier effective mass 0.60 and 0.97 m0 for holes and electrons, as shown in Table S5 (ESI†). Fig. 2e and f show the electronic bandgap variation for 8 different M+ and M3+ combinations. We find that the bandgap decreases monotonically with X− changing from Cl− and Br− to I− due to increasing of the atomic radius. The p-orbital overlap of halogen atoms becomes large from Cl− to I− in the occupied state, which leads to raising of the VBM and decreasing of the bandgap. The bandgap of Bi3+-based perovskites is larger than that of Sb3+-based ones. The direct bandgap values are in the range of 1.55–3.82 eV, while the indirect bandgaps are relatively large within 2.35–3.93 eV. It is interesting to note that the direct bandgap perovskites are more suitable as ideal solar absorbers, especially Cs2In1/2Sb1/2I4 with a direct bandgap of 1.55 eV.
In order to know the influence of the spin–orbit-coupling (SOC) on electronic structures in 2D lead-free halide double perovskites, we further calculate electron band structures of Cs2In1/2Sb1/2I4 with the SOC effect. Our calculations clearly show that the electron band structures are similar to Fig. 2a just except for a negligible spin-splitting (∼0.08 eV) at the CBM. Moreover, compared with Fig. 2a, several key parameters, such as the bandgap (1.52 eV), the effective mass (0.18/0.59 m0) of holes/electrons and their mobility (655/420 cm2 V−1 s−1), are almost unchanged. This clearly indicates that electronic structures with/without the SOC effect have a nonsignificant difference in our 2D RP-type lead-free halide double perovskites. Hence, the SOC effect has been neglected in our following calculations.
In Fig. 3, we further show the band structures of Cs3InSbI7 (n = 2) and Cs4In3/2Sb3/2I10 (n = 3). Please refer to Fig. S3 (ESI†) for their crystal structures. It clearly shows that the thick CsInSbI perovskite still keeps the direct bandgap character with the appropriate gap values of 1.37 and 1.29 eV for n = 2 and 3, respectively. We note that the bandgap approaches the best value of 1.34 eV for solar cells and is smaller than that of MAPbI3 (1.50–1.61 eV),2,4,38 which will extend the absorption to the low energy region and lead to enhanced visible-light absorption and utilization. The sharp energy dispersion curves directly result in a small carrier effective mass and large carrier mobility, i.e., 1800 (1023) cm2 V−1 s−1 for holes (electrons) in Cs4In3/2Sb3/2I10 (see Table 2). These suggest that the CsInSbI-based perovskite has great potential to be a good choice for solar cell absorbers due to its excellent visible-light absorption and high carrier mobility. Moreover, the large bandgap tunability and high carrier mobility are also promising for solid-state-lighting device applications, such as LED and photodetector devices.
 Fig. 3  The band structures of (a) n = 2 Cs3InSbI7 and (b) n = 3 Cs4In3/2Sb3/2I10 direct bandgap semiconductors. Compared with Fig. 2a, we find that the bandgap reduces from 1.55 to 1.29 eV when n increases from 1 to 3. These bandgaps are very amazing for enhanced visible-light harvesting. Here, the band structures are derived from the GGA-PBE calculations, in which the underestimated bandgaps are modified according to GGA-1/2 calculations. This clearly indicates that the 2D CsInSbI-based perovskite is a promising and robust solar cell absorber and solid-state-lighting material. 
It is well-known that indirect bandgap semiconductors have a low light absorption efficiency and thus a thick layer is needed to absorb sufficient solar energy for photovoltaic applications. On the contrary, direct bandgap semiconductors, although with good optical absorption, have a disadvantage of their fast carrier recombination rate and thus short carrier lifetime. Moreover, we know from the above discussions that Cl/Br-based perovskites have a larger bandgap and more stable structure than I-based ones. In order to balance the benefits of direct and indirect bandgap semiconductors and broaden the choice of Cl/Br-based double perovskites, we further construct 7 heterostructures by combining several different perovskite layers based on the principles of lattice match, direct bandgap and type-II band alignment, in which the different 2D perovskite layers are directly stacked together with a shift of b/2 along the b-axis just as the bulk RP-type perovskite (see Fig. S4, ESI†). Both the interlayer distance d and lattice mismatch in these 2D perovskite heterostructures are summarized in Table S4 (ESI†).

Fig. 4a shows the weighted energy band structure of the Cs2In1/2Sb1/2Cl4/Cs2Cu1/2Bi1/2Cl4 heterostructure, plotted by using different colors according to the different contributions of CsInSbCl and CsCuBiCl layers. We can see that the heterostructure, a robust direct bandgap semiconductor, has a GW electronic gap Eg = 2.45 eV at the Γ-point with the VBM dominated by the CsCuBiCl layer and the CBM mainly contributed by the CsInSbCl layer. Fig. 4b shows the corresponding PDOSs of the heterostructure, in which the detailed orbital contributions are similar to the isolated material, i.e., the Cu and Cl atoms for the VBM and the Sb and Cl atoms for the CBM. The charge density isosurface in Fig. 4c also shows that the VBM (CBM) is located in the CsCuBiCl (CsInSbCl) layer, which clearly indicates the spatial separation of electrons and holes in the heterostructure. The electron and hole localization in different layers is known as type-II band alignment, which will greatly reduce the photo-generated carrier recombination rate. As shown in Fig. 4d, the band offsets of Cs2In1/2Sb1/2Cl4 and Cs2Cu1/2Bi1/2Cl4 are 1.10 eV for the CBM and 0.29 eV for the VBM, respectively. In Fig. S5 (ESI†), we plot the band structures of the other 6 heterostructures, in which all heterostructures have a type-II band alignment with the highly desired spatial separation of carriers for photovoltaic devices.
 Fig. 4  (a) The weighted band structure and (b) the corresponding PDOSs of the n = 1/m = 1 Cs2In1/2Sb1/2Cl4/Cs2Cu1/2Bi1/2Cl4 heterostructure. The colors of bands and PDOSs show that the important CBM is mainly contributed by the CsInSbCl-layer and the VBM is dominated by the CsCuBiCl-layer, which is also clearly proved by the isosurface charge density distributions (c) at the VBM and CBM (ρ = 1.0 × 10−3 e Å−3). (d) The band alignment of Cs2In1/2Sb1/2Cl4 and Cs2Cu1/2Bi1/2Cl4 in their heterostructure. Here, the vacuum level Evac is taken as a reference. It clearly indicates that the photo-generated electrons and holes are spatially separated due to the type-II band alignment, which is beneficial to reduce the electron–hole recombination and enhance the visible-light harvesting. The PCE can thus be improved in CsInSbCl/CsCuBiCl-based perovskite solar cells. 
It is worthwhile to note that the bandgap of the Cs2In1/2Sb1/2Cl4/Cs2Cu1/2Bi1/2Cl4 heterostructure is 2.45 eV, which is smaller than isolated Cs2In1/2Sb1/2Cl4 (2.89 eV) and Cs2Cu1/2Bi1/2Cl4 (3.82 eV) layers (see Fig. 2e). It means that the heterostructure can effectively reduce the bandgap of Cl/Br-based perovskites and broaden the choice of candidates. However, the energy bandgap of 2.45 eV is still larger than the bandgap (1.50–1.61 eV) of MAPbI3. From the results of thick layer CsInSbI (n = 2 and 3) shown in Fig. 3, we know that the bandgap can be effectively reduced with increasing the layer number. In Fig. 5, we further calculate the band structures of several thick heterostructures. Interestingly, we find that all these heterostructures are still direct bandgap with the robust type-II band alignment. The bandgaps are obviously reduced to 2.06, 2.12 and 1.89 eV for n = 2/m = 1, n = 1/m = 2 and n = 2/m = 2 heterostructures. Especially, for n = 3/m = 1 Cs4In3/2Sb3/2Cl10/Cs2Cu1/2Bi1/2Cl4, the bandgap is 1.65 eV, which is very close to the bandgap of MAPbI3. Hence, these results clearly indicate that the perovskite heterostructure is a useful strategy to modulate the electronic structures and carrier distribution of 2D layered RP-type lead-free halide double perovskites.
 Fig. 5  The weighted band structures of layered CsInSbCl/CsCuBiCl-based heterostructures for (a) Cs3InSbCl7/Cs2Cu1/2Bi1/2Cl4, (b) Cs2In1/2Sb1/2Cl4/Cs3CuBiCl7, (c) Cs3InSbCl7/Cs3CuBiCl7 and (d) Cs4In3/2Sb3/2Cl10/Cs2Cu1/2Bi1/2Cl4. All these heterostructures are direct bandgap semiconductors with the type-II band alignment, which directly leads to the spatial separation of photo-generated electrons and holes at the band edge. Moreover, the bandgap decreases as the layer thickness increases and approaches the bandgap of MAPbI3 (∼1.50–1.61 eV). 
Optical absorption and excitonic effect
In order to investigate the important interband optical transition and excitonic effect, in Fig. 6 and Fig. S6 (ESI†), we present the imaginary part ε2 of the dielectric function based on the powerful and time-consuming GW-BSE calculations. As shown in Fig. 6a and b, the GW electronic (optical) bandgap is 1.29 (1.01) and 1.65 (1.31) eV for freestanding Cs4In3/2Sb3/2I10 and Cs4In3/2Sb3/2Cl10/Cs2Cu1/2Bi1/2Cl4, in which the exciton binding energies, given by the difference between the electronic and optical bandgaps, are found to be 0.28 and 0.34 eV, respectively. The values of exciton binding energy in these 2D lead-free halide double perovskites are much larger than that in their bulk phase (∼2–20 meV for MAPbI3).9 This is because of the strong 2D quantum confinement and the incomplete dielectric screening due to their ultrathin thickness. The exciton binding energies are comparable with those in other familiar 2D semiconductor materials, such as phosphorene (0.8–0.9 eV70,71), MoS2 (∼1.0 eV72,73) and graphdiyne (∼0.55 eV74). Moreover, we can see from Fig. S6 (ESI†) that the exciton binding energy of the heterostructure is much smaller than the isolated Cs2In1/2Sb1/2Cl4 (0.94 eV) and Cs2Cu1/2Bi1/2Cl4 (1.02 eV) due to increasing of the thickness.
 Fig. 6  The calculated imaginary part ε2 of the dielectric function is given for (a) free-standing Cs4In3/2Sb3/2I10 and (b) the Cs4In3/2Sb3/2Cl10/Cs2Cu1/2Bi1/2Cl4 heterostructure by using the accurate and time-consuming GW-BSE calculations. The exciton binding energies are 0.28 and 0.34 eV for Cs4In3/2Sb3/2I10 and the Cs4In3/2Sb3/2Cl10/Cs2Cu1/2Bi1/2Cl4 heterostructure, respectively. (c) The schematic illustration of an actual solar cell device. Generally, the carrier transport layer is a high k dielectric (for example, TiO2 with εr ∼ 75–8075,76) and the electrode is a metal, which will significantly reduce the exciton binding energy to several meV in a real device due to the enhanced dielectric screening effect. Hence, the photo-generated electrons and holes can be regarded as free carriers approximately in 2D perovskite solar cell devices. (d) The schematic illustration of a 2D perovskite-based LED device. The large exciton binding energy ∼0.3 eV is beneficial to enhance the PL quantum efficiency of solid-state-lighting devices. 
It is worthwhile to note that, compared with the 3D counterparts, the relatively large exciton binding energy in these 2D perovskites is just derived in the freestanding case with the vacuum dielectric environment (εr = 1). However, considering the actual structure of a solar cell device, shown in Fig. 6c, we note that a high-k electron transport layer is usually used. For example, the widely-used electron transport layer TiO2 has a large dielectric constant of about 75–80.75,76 Furthermore, the electrode is always a metal, like Au. Both the high-k transport layer and metal electrode will significantly enhance the environmental dielectric constant and dielectric screening effect. Hence, the exciton binding energy of 2D perovskite-based photovoltaic devices is still small enough (∼several meV) and the photo-generated carriers can be separated easily. Both electrons and holes can thus be regarded as free carriers in 2D perovskite-based photovoltaic devices. On the contrary, the large exciton binding energy (∼0.3 eV) in freestanding 2D perovskites is also extremely useful for solid-state-lighting devices as shown in Fig. 6d, which can enhance the PL efficiency due to their large exciton binding energy. Moreover, the carrier spatial separation in all heterostructures with type-II band alignment is also beneficial to reduce the photo-generated carrier recombination in photovoltaic devices. The good optical properties greatly broaden the potential of 2D lead-free halide double perovskites both in solar cell and LED devices.
In Fig. 7, we make a comparison of the optical absorption coefficient for layered Csn+1Inn/2Sbn/2I3n+1 (n = 1–3) (Fig. 7a) and Csn+1Inn/2Sbn/2Cl3n+1/Csm+1Cum/2Bim/2Cl3m+1 (n = 1–3, m = 1, 2) heterostructures (Fig. 7b) with the ideal optical absorption of bulk MAPbI3.31 We can clearly see that MAPbI3 has an excellent optical absorption property, which the theoretical optical absorption coefficient can reach 105 cm−1 in the visible-light region. This value is much higher than perovskite oxides (∼103–104 cm−1), and even widely-used silicon (∼104 cm−1).77 It is interesting to note that the direct bandgap layered CsInSbI has a similar optical absorption to MAPbI3. It will result in high performance in solar light absorption and conversion. Surprisingly, we note that our results broaden the absorption peak of 2D CsInSbI to lower energy due to their smaller bandgap than MAPbI3. For CsInSbCl/CsCuBiCl-based heterostructures, their absorption coefficients are slightly smaller than that of MAPbI3 and have a great enhancement compared with the isolated layered Cs2In1/2Sb1/2Cl4 and Cs2Cu1/2Bi1/2Cl4 (dashed lines in Fig. 7b). Moreover, we note that the absorption coefficient is obviously enhanced with increasing the layer thickness. The ultrahigh optical absorption coefficient is quite useful, which makes the layered CsInSbI and CsInSbCl/CsCuBiCl promising as ideal candidates for high-performance solar cell absorbers.
 Fig. 7  The calculated absorption spectra of layered lead-free halide double perovskites (a) Csn+1Inn/2Sbn/2I3n+1 (n = 1–3) and heterostructures (b) Csn+1Inn/2Sbn/2Cl3n+1/Csm+1Cum/2Bim/2Cl3m+1 (n = 1–3, m = 1, 2). For the sake of comparison, the absorption spectrum of MAPbI3 is also given (black line). Similar to MAPbI3, the layered CsInSbI and CsInSbCl/CsCuBiCl have a large absorption coefficient (105 cm−1). The absorption edge of CsInSbI (n = 2, 3) is smaller than that of MAPbI3 (∼1.50–1.61 eV) and approaches the silicon bandgap (∼1.14 eV77). Moreover, the absorption coefficient of the CsInSbCl/CsCuBiCl-based heterostructure is significantly larger than the isolated CsInSbCl and CsCuBiCl layers. The remarkable electron–hole spatial separation can reduce their recombination greatly in the CsInSbCl/CsCuBiCl heterostructure, which is highly desirable for improving the PCE of solar cells. 
Carrier effective mass and mobility
The carrier effective mass and mobility directly influence the diffusion length of photo-generated carriers and the PCE of solar cell devices. Combining the first-principles calculations for the band structures and the DP theory, we further calculate the carrier effective mass and mobility of layered CsInSbI, CsInSbCl/CsCuBiCl and other 2D perovskites in Table 2 and Table S5 (ESI†). We can find from Table 2 that the hole and the electron mobility of Cs2In1/2Sb1/2I4 are 655 and 308 cm2 V−1 s−1, which are three orders of magnitude larger than those of MAPbI3 due to the small carrier effective mass.69 The carrier mobility of the Cs2In1/2Sb1/2Cl4/Cs2Cu1/2Bi1/2Cl4 heterostructure, combining the advantages of isolated materials, becomes large for both holes (70 cm2 V−1 s−1) and electrons (165 cm2 V−1 s−1), due to the type-II band alignment. We also clearly see that the mobility increases quickly with increasing layer thickness, especially for Cs4In3/2Sb3/2I10; both the hole and electron mobility can reach 103 cm2 V−1 s−1. Another interesting phenomenon is that the difference between me* and mh* in 2D double perovskites, especially their heterostructures, becomes smaller compared with MAPbI3. This is beneficial for ambipolar carrier conduction and efficient carrier extraction for both electrons and holes. The ultrahigh carrier mobility in 2D CsInSbI and CsInSbCl/CsCuBiCl is an excellent advantage for solar cell absorbers and will greatly improve the performance of charge transport in photovoltaic devices.
Conclusion
In conclusion, we have systematically investigated the electronic, optical and transport properties of 24 RP-type 2D lead-free halide double perovskites Csn+1Mn/2+Mn/23+X3n+1 (M+: In+, Cu+, Ag+, Au+; M3+: Bi3+, Sb3+) and their 7 heterostructures based on powerful first-principles and advanced GW-BSE calculations for the first time. Through comprehensive comparison and analysis, we find that 2D Csn+1Inn/2Sbn/2I3n+1 is a promising material with a direct bandgap of 1.55, 1.37 and 1.29 eV for n = 1 to 3 and has a large optical absorption coefficient ∼105 cm−1. The energy bandgap and optical absorption are quite suitable for solar cell absorbers and comparable with the widely-used MAPbI3. The Cs2In1/2Sb1/2Cl4/Cs2Cu1/2Bi1/2Cl4 heterostructure with type-II band alignment has a direct bandgap of 2.45 eV with spatial separation of photo-generated carriers, which directly leads to a low carrier recombination rate for photovoltaic devices. Moreover, the energy gap can be further reduced by increasing the layer thickness, for example, 1.65 eV for the Cs4In3/2Sb3/2Cl10/Cs2Cu1/2Bi1/2Cl4 heterostructure. The exciton binding energy ∼0.30 eV in Cs4In3/2Sb3/2I10 is beneficial to enhance PL quantum efficiency for solid-state-lighting devices. On the contrary, the exciton binding energy will be significantly reduced to several meV by the high-k dielectric transport layer and metal-electrode for solar cell devices. The absorption coefficient (∼105 cm−1) of heterostructures is obviously larger than that of the isolated building-blocks. Surprisingly, the carrier mobilities of 2D CsInSbI and CsInSbCl/CsCuBiCl are three/four orders of magnitude larger than those of MAPbI3 up to 102–103 cm2 V−1 s−1. Our calculations for 2D halide double perovskites offer useful guidance for designing Pb-free halide perovskites as solar cell absorbers and suggest that the layered CsInSbI and CsInSbCl/CsCuBiCl-based heterostructures are promising materials with great potential as the best candidate among 2D halide double perovskites for future solar cell and solid-state-lighting device applications.

 	Fig. 2  Two typical electronic band structures and orbital projected density of states (PDOSs) of n = 1 (a) Cs2In1/2Sb1/2I4 with a direct bandgap of 1.55 eV and (b) Cs2Ag1/2Sb1/2I4 with an indirect bandgap of 2.35 eV. The corresponding isosurface charge density distributions at the VBM and CBM (ρ = 1.0 × 10−3 e Å−3) for (c) Cs2In1/2Sb1/2I4 and (d) Cs2Ag1/2Sb1/2I4, respectively. The variation of bandgaps with M+ and M3+ elements for (e) direct bandgap CsInBiX, CsInSbX, CsCuBiX and CsCuSbX and (f) indirect bandgap CsAgBiX, CsAgSbX, CsAuBiX and CsAuSbX 2D lead-free perovskites. The remaining six band structures and PDOSs of I-based perovskites are shown in Fig. S1 and S2 (ESI†). As the halogen atom changes from Cl to I, both the electronic energy bands and PDOSs are similar to the corresponding I-based perovskites and are thus not shown here, while the bandgap decreases monotonically. Here, the band structures are derived from the accurate GW calculations. It is worthwhile to note that, similar to MAPbI3, Cs2In1/2Sb1/2I4 has a direct bandgap of 1.55 eV, which is highly desirable for solar cell absorbers.

 	Fig. 3  The band structures of (a) n = 2 Cs3InSbI7 and (b) n = 3 Cs4In3/2Sb3/2I10 direct bandgap semiconductors. Compared with Fig. 2a, we find that the bandgap reduces from 1.55 to 1.29 eV when n increases from 1 to 3. These bandgaps are very amazing for enhanced visible-light harvesting. Here, the band structures are derived from the GGA-PBE calculations, in which the underestimated bandgaps are modified according to GGA-1/2 calculations. This clearly indicates that the 2D CsInSbI-based perovskite is a promising and robust solar cell absorber and solid-state-lighting material.	 

 	Fig. 4  (a) The weighted band structure and (b) the corresponding PDOSs of the n = 1/m = 1 Cs2In1/2Sb1/2Cl4/Cs2Cu1/2Bi1/2Cl4 heterostructure. The colors of bands and PDOSs show that the important CBM is mainly contributed by the CsInSbCl-layer and the VBM is dominated by the CsCuBiCl-layer, which is also clearly proved by the isosurface charge density distributions (c) at the VBM and CBM (ρ = 1.0 × 10−3 e Å−3). (d) The band alignment of Cs2In1/2Sb1/2Cl4 and Cs2Cu1/2Bi1/2Cl4 in their heterostructure. Here, the vacuum level Evac is taken as a reference. It clearly indicates that the photo-generated electrons and holes are spatially separated due to the type-II band alignment, which is beneficial to reduce the electron–hole recombination and enhance the visible-light harvesting. The PCE can thus be improved in CsInSbCl/CsCuBiCl-based perovskite solar cells.	 

 	Fig. 5  The weighted band structures of layered CsInSbCl/CsCuBiCl-based heterostructures for (a) Cs3InSbCl7/Cs2Cu1/2Bi1/2Cl4, (b) Cs2In1/2Sb1/2Cl4/Cs3CuBiCl7, (c) Cs3InSbCl7/Cs3CuBiCl7 and (d) Cs4In3/2Sb3/2Cl10/Cs2Cu1/2Bi1/2Cl4. All these heterostructures are direct bandgap semiconductors with the type-II band alignment, which directly leads to the spatial separation of photo-generated electrons and holes at the band edge. Moreover, the bandgap decreases as the layer thickness increases and approaches the bandgap of MAPbI3 (∼1.50–1.61 eV).	 

 	Fig. 6  The calculated imaginary part ε2 of the dielectric function is given for (a) free-standing Cs4In3/2Sb3/2I10 and (b) the Cs4In3/2Sb3/2Cl10/Cs2Cu1/2Bi1/2Cl4 heterostructure by using the accurate and time-consuming GW-BSE calculations. The exciton binding energies are 0.28 and 0.34 eV for Cs4In3/2Sb3/2I10 and the Cs4In3/2Sb3/2Cl10/Cs2Cu1/2Bi1/2Cl4 heterostructure, respectively. (c) The schematic illustration of an actual solar cell device. Generally, the carrier transport layer is a high k dielectric (for example, TiO2 with εr ∼ 75–8075,76) and the electrode is a metal, which will significantly reduce the exciton binding energy to several meV in a real device due to the enhanced dielectric screening effect. Hence, the photo-generated electrons and holes can be regarded as free carriers approximately in 2D perovskite solar cell devices. (d) The schematic illustration of a 2D perovskite-based LED device. The large exciton binding energy ∼0.3 eV is beneficial to enhance the PL quantum efficiency of solid-state-lighting devices.	 

 	Fig. 7  The calculated absorption spectra of layered lead-free halide double perovskites (a) Csn+1Inn/2Sbn/2I3n+1 (n = 1–3) and heterostructures (b) Csn+1Inn/2Sbn/2Cl3n+1/Csm+1Cum/2Bim/2Cl3m+1 (n = 1–3, m = 1, 2). For the sake of comparison, the absorption spectrum of MAPbI3 is also given (black line). Similar to MAPbI3, the layered CsInSbI and CsInSbCl/CsCuBiCl have a large absorption coefficient (105 cm−1). The absorption edge of CsInSbI (n = 2, 3) is smaller than that of MAPbI3 (∼1.50–1.61 eV) and approaches the silicon bandgap (∼1.14 eV77). Moreover, the absorption coefficient of the CsInSbCl/CsCuBiCl-based heterostructure is significantly larger than the isolated CsInSbCl and CsCuBiCl layers. The remarkable electron–hole spatial separation can reduce their recombination greatly in the CsInSbCl/CsCuBiCl heterostructure, which is highly desirable for improving the PCE of solar cells.
