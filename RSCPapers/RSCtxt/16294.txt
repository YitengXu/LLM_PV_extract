    , Accepted 2nd June 2021First published on 3rd June 2021AbstractThermocatalytic decomposition (TCD) of methane can produce hydrogen and valuable nanocarbon co-products with low to near-zero CO2 emission. In this study, a series of Pd promoted Ni catalysts, prepared with various Ni/Pd ratios on a CNT support, were evaluated for methane TCD performance. Characterization and calculations using density functional theory (DFT) were carried out to elucidate the activity–structure relationship and growth mechanism of carbon nanomaterials. It was found that the methane conversion and stability of the catalysts were highly dependent on the Ni/Pd ratio and reaction temperature. DFT calculations revealed that the diffusion of carbon in the metal sublayer required for CNT growth was more favorable in the Ni–Pd alloy lattice suggesting that the buildup of carbon in the metal alloy sublayer facilitated the formation of CNTs and CNFs. A cyclic reaction–regeneration process for self-sustained TCD was experimentally demonstrated. In each cycle, a portion of the separated CNT product was used to re-synthesize the Ni–Pd/CNT catalyst for use in the next reaction cycle. After five cycles of operation, the CH4 conversion, morphology and crystallinity of the carbon product remained unchanged.
1. Introduction
The use of hydrogen as an energy carrier with high conversion efficiency and zero carbon emission is receiving unprecedented support from government and broad industrial sectors. However, the vast majority of the world's H2 supply is produced from fossil fuels thereby resulting in CO2 emissions. For example, about 96% of global H2 (48% in the United States) is produced via steam methane reforming (SMR), leading to an average emission of 10 kg CO2 per kg H2.1,2 Therefore, owing to environmental and potential future regulatory concerns it is desirable to develop a process for near-zero CO2 production of H2 and one that is economically viable.
Renewable energy, such as solar-assisted water electrolysis, is clean and sustainable for high-purity H2 production. However, the unpredictable energy resource and dependence on stable power grid are the challenges to overcome.3,4 Hydrogen production from biomass via bio-photolysis, fermentation and gasification was reported but suffered from low H2 production rates and yields.5,6
In contrast, TCD of methane proves to be a promising option because of its efficient production of H2 and valuable solid carbon.7–9 The commercial viability of the TCD process is highly dependent on the efficiency, stability and regeneration of the catalyst. With respect to catalyst development, many possible mono- and bi-metallic and carbonaceous catalysts have been reported with morphological features being studied.10,11 Catalyst supports investigated include various metal oxides and carbon while unsupported catalysts are of interest as well.12,13 These studies were carried out on the selection of metals, catalyst supports14,15 and the methods of catalyst preparation.16,17 Thermo-catalytic decomposition of methane to COx-free hydrogen and valuable carbon materials has been reviewed.18,19 Chen et al.20 have conducted a kinetic study on thermo-catalytic decomposition of methane using an electroless Ni plating catalyst at 525–600 °C. The results showed that the reaction order was 2 and the activation energy for this specific reaction was 113.993 kJ mol−1. The study further found out that the deactivation order was 0.5 and the deactivation energy was 147.870 kJ mol−1. In addition, molten salts were studied for methane reforming, which might be considered for methane decomposition.21,22 Kang et al.23 have shown that the Fe containing molten salts (NaCl–KCl) catalyzed the methane decomposition into graphitic solid carbon and H2 in a bubble column reactor. It was also reported that a bubble column reactor containing liquid or vapor tellurium was able to facilitate the methane pyrolysis.24 Although there was mechanistic studies on the formation of carbon nanomaterials over metal supported catalysts,20,25 the in-depth investigation using density functional theory (DFT) for the CNT supported binary metal catalyst is worth investigating.26–28 As a part of this study, DFT modeling work was carried out to study the TCD mechanism over Ni–Pd catalysts.
A forward movement of TCD commercialization seems not very effective because few studies have focused on TCD-based processes that represent industrial practice. Many researchers were trying to solve catalyst stability issues by developing new catalytic materials. However, a catalyst with everlasting activity might not be urgently needed because an industrial TCD process may need a cyclic regeneration configuration where TCD is operated in a continuous reaction–regeneration mode. In such an operating mode, separation of carbon from the solid catalyst would need to take place at a certain time-on-stream of TCD. Therefore, the commercialization strategy is to carry out in-process catalyst–carbon separation and regeneration as practiced in petroleum refineries.
Effective catalyst–carbon separation and catalyst regeneration are major challenges to the success of TCD commercialization. Mechanical separation by an attrition method was examined in a fluidized-bed reactor but the separation efficiency was low.29 The use of carbon catalysts seemed to be able to eliminate the carbon product separation step.30 However, the activity of the carbon catalyst gradually declined and without oxidized regeneration its activity would not be recovered.31 Acid treatment is commonly used for separation and purification of grown CNTs from catalysts,32 while both the oxide support and metal on the support are dissolved in acid making metal recovery difficult.
In this study, a TCD process consisting of cyclic reaction–regeneration was experimentally demonstrated where a Ni–Pd/CNT catalyst could be regenerated and re-used. As illustrated in Fig. 1, after the TCD reaction, separation of carbon products (CNTs/CNFs) and the catalyst was accomplished by using acid to dissolve Ni–Pd, leading to metal-free CNTs. The acid-leached Ni–Pd was recovered and re-used. In the regeneration step, a portion of the carbon product (i.e., CNTs/CNFs) was used as the catalyst support, and the catalyst was re-synthesized using recovered Ni–Pd. The objectives of this study were to study the growth mechanism of CNTs/CNFs over supported Ni–Pd catalysts and demonstrate the feasibility of cyclic regeneration for potential commercial application.

2. Experimental and DFT calculation methods
2.1. Catalyst preparation
The monometallic and bimetallic catalysts containing a total amount of 11 wt% metal on CNTs (X of Ni:1Pd) were prepared via a solvothermal method. The weight ratio of metal is designed as X of Ni:1 Pd for supported and unsupported catalysts. For example, 10Ni–1Pd/CNT means the Ni loading is (10/11)* 11 wt% total metal and the Pd loading is (1/11)* 11 wt% total metal over 89 wt% of CNTs; unsupported 15Ni–1Pd means catalysts with 15/16 wt% of Ni and 1/16 wt% of Pd. The precursors of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (Acros Organics, 99%) and Pd(NO3)2·2H2O (Sigma-Aldrich, ∼40% Pd basis) were dissolved in 50 ml acetone (Fisher Scientific, Certified ACS) under agitation for 1 h and sonicated for 25 minutes before the CNT (Cheap tubes Inc., >95%) was added into the solution. The solution was continuously stirred for 3 h and subsequently sonicated for 30 min. The resulting solution was transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave (100 ml), sealed and heated to 120 °C for 12 h. After the autoclave was cooled to room temperature, the solution from the autoclave was placed inside a fume hood to evaporate the acetone solution at room temperature and subsequently dried overnight at 80 °C until completely dry. Dry solids were ground into fine powders, reduced at 400 °C for 4 h in a tube furnace using 10 mol% H2 in N2 (H2: 99.999%; N2: 99.999%) at 50 ml min−1, and stored in a vacuum desiccator. The unsupported catalysts were prepared following the same protocol.
2.2. Catalyst preparation for the cyclic reaction–regeneration test
After the first cycle reaction, the spent catalyst was refluxed with 3.0 M HNO3 (Fisher Scientific, Certified ACS Plus) at 120 °C for 4 h and concentrated HNO3 at 130 °C for 12 h under continuous agitation. After the acid digestion, the carbon particles were filtered, washed with deionized water, and dried at 80 °C in stagnant air. A portion of the product carbon was used to synthesize the catalyst for the next cycle. The catalyst synthesis protocol (i.e., metal deposition, drying, and reduction) used to generate the catalyst for the following cycles was the same as the fresh catalyst.
2.3. Catalytic activity measurements
The CH4 TCD reaction was performed using a vertical fixed-bed reactor with a quartz tube (i.d. = 10 mm, o.d. = 12 cm, and length = 44.5 cm) and heated by an electric tubular furnace (Applied Test System Inc.). The reaction temperature was measured by a K-type thermocouple located above the catalyst bed. The total feed gas flow rate was set at 30 ml min−1 consisting of 30 mol% CH4 in N2. For each test, the amount of reduced catalyst used was 0.2 g, and the reactor was purged with N2 at 70 ml min−1 and heated to 120 °C for 30 min. Then the tests were conducted at temperatures between 500 and 700 °C with a ramping rate of 10 °C min−1. The composition of the outflow gas was analyzed using a 4-channel Fusion Micro GC manufactured by INFICON Inc. Under reaction conditions, the CH4 conversion (%) and H2 selectivity were described as follows in eqn (1) and (2). CH4 conversion (%) = (1 − (CHout4Nin2/CHin4Nout2)) × 100%(1)where CHout4 and CHin4 were the mole concentration of the CH4 outlet and inlet, respectively and Nout2 and Nin2 were the mole concentration of the N2 outlet and inlet, respectively. H2 selectivity = (Hout2 × Nin2/(2 × CHin4 × Nout2 × CH4 concentration))(2)where Hout2 was the mole concentration of the H2 outlet.
2.4. Characterizations of the catalyst
X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed with a PANalytical X'Pert Pro X-ray diffractometer using a Cu Kα source (45 kV and 40 mA). The morphology of the catalysts and produced carbon nanomaterials was analyzed with a transmission electron microscope (TEM). The TEM images were obtained with a JEOL JEM-2100 operated at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. The sample preparation was done by sonication in acetone solution for 15 min. After that, a few drops of suspension were dropped onto the TEM grid for analysis. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) was used to map the distribution of metal elements on particles. The STEM imaging was performed on an aberration-corrected Titan 80-300 apparatus at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were obtained using a Hitachi S-4700. The thermal stability and purity of the catalysts were studied by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) on a TA Instruments SDT 650 analyzer. The maximum temperature reached was 900 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. The gas mixture used in the TGA analysis contained 5 mol% O2 in He (Airgas) with a flow rate of 100 sccm. Raman spectroscopic analysis was performed using a Renishaw InVia Raman microscope with an excitation wavelength of 532 nm.
2.5. DFT calculation methods
Binding energies of intermediates were calculated using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP-5.3.5 version, University of Vienna) DFT code.33 The plane wave basis function was used to describe the Kohn Sham one electron valence states, whereas the core-electrons were described using the Vanderbilt ultrasoft pseudopotentials.34 An energy cut-off of 396 eV was used for the plane-wave basis functions. The GGA revised Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (RPBE) exchange–correlation functional developed by Hammer et al.35 was used for all the calculations.
The bimetallic Ni–Pd alloy is modelled using the Ni3Pd alloy FCC crystal geometry. Lattice optimization of the Ni3Pd crystal is performed to obtain the correct lattice parameter a = b = c = 3.71 Å, alpha = 90°. The terrace (111) surface of Ni, Pd, and Ni3Pd was modelled using a slab of 4 layers of size 4 × 4. The bottom two layers of the surface slab are kept fixed while the upper half along the adsorbates are allowed to relax, as has been shown in Fig. 2. A vacuum of 20 Å is added along the z-axis between the slabs to represent the adsorption of gas-phase species onto the metal surface. A 3 × 3 × 1 Monkhorst–Pack36k-point grid is used for the irreducible Brillouin zone. The force and energy convergence criteria are set to 0.05 eV Å−1 and 10−4 eV, respectively. All the calculations performed for Ni(111) and Ni3Pd(111) surfaces were spin-polarized. The Methfessel–Paxton37 smearing parameter of value 0.2 is used for all the calculations. The (111) closed packed terrace is the most abundant surface having ∼75% surface area. Sanchez-Valencia et al. have experimentally produced (6,6) CNTs over a Pt(111) surface.38 The (111) terrace surface was used by Harpale et al.,39 Elliott et al.,40 and Gili et al.41 to study CH4 to graphene and CNT/CF formation over a Ni catalyst under CVD conditions. The preferential growth of the CNT/CF over the (111) surface can be attributed to the symmetry match between the metal (111) surface and the graphene layer, with both having hexagonal C6 symmetry.27

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Physiochemical properties and morphology of Ni–Pd alloy catalysts
The Ni/Pd ratio was varied for both unsupported and CNT-supported catalysts to investigate the effects of the support and metal composition. Fig. 3a presents the XRD results of as-reduced Ni–Pd–CNT catalysts with different Ni/Pd ratios. The XRD patterns of CNTs, Pd/CNT, and Ni/CNT show their characteristic peaks confirming their crystalline structures, according to their standard XRD patterns in Fig. S1.† The XRD spectra of 10Ni–1Pd/CNT, 5Ni–1Pd/CNT, and 1Ni–1Pd/CNT show similar patterns with that of Ni/CNT, indicating that these bimetallic particles are well-crystallized forming a Ni-based Ni–Pd alloy lattice.42 With the addition of Pd, the two main peaks corresponding to the fcc Ni lattice shift to lower angles from 44.5 (Ni/CNT) to 42.9° (1Ni–1Pd/CNT), suggesting that the lattices of bimetallic catalysts are enlarged due to the larger atomic radius of Pd as compared with Ni. The same phenomenon in diffraction can also be observed for the as-reduced and spent unsupported Ni–Pd catalysts which are shown in Fig. S1 and S2.† Shown in Fig. 3b and S3† are the STEM-EDS mappings of the spent unsupported 10Ni–1Pd and 10Ni–1Pd/CNT catalysts on which Ni and Pd atoms are well-dispersed throughout the metallic particles. This agrees with the XRD results and further proves the Ni–Pd alloy formation.
 Fig. 3  a) XRD patterns of the fresh (reduced) CNT-supported Ni–Pd catalysts. b) STEM-EDS mapping of spent unsupported 10Ni–1Pd. c–f) TEM images of fresh (reduced) catalysts. The CNT-supported catalysts and unsupported catalysts were prepared via the same solvothermal method. The weight ratio of metal is designed as X of Ni:1Pd catalysts. For example, 20Ni–1Pd/CNT means that the Ni loading is (20/21)* 11 wt% total metal and the Pd loading is (1/21)* 11 wt% total metal over 89 wt% of CNTs; unsupported 15Ni–1Pd means catalysts with 15/16 wt% of Ni and 1/16 wt% of Pd. 

Fig. 3(c–f) show the TEM images of the fresh catalysts which show that the metal particle size and morphology are affected by both the presence of a support (CNT) and Pd content. First, the use of the CNT support causes the decrease of the average metal particle size. For example, the fresh 10Ni–1Pd/CNT (Fig. 3c) shows a narrow metal particle size distribution with an average size of 18 nm, while the unsupported 10Ni–1Pd catalyst (Fig. 3d) consists of agglomerates composed of around 50 nm metal particles. Moreover, the addition of Pd causes a decrease of the metal particle size for the CNT-supported catalysts, which is consistent with literature reports.43,44 Fig. S4† shows that the metal particle distribution of the fresh Ni/CNT is bimodal and has an average particle size of ≈44 nm, while for the 1Ni–1Pd/CNT, the particle size distribution narrows down and the average particle size decreases to ≈9 nm. As shown in Fig. S5† SEM images, severe sintering of microparticles is found over the unsupported Ni (Fig. S5a and b†), while less sintering is observed over 15Ni–1Pd (Fig. S5c and d†) and spherical nanoparticles can be clearly observed on 10Ni–1Pd (Fig. S5e and f†).
3.2. Performance of Ni–Pd catalysts in methane TCD
Catalytic performances of the supported and unsupported Ni–Pd catalysts in TCD are shown in Fig. 4. As shownin Fig. 4a, CNT-supported and unsupported Ni catalysts deactivate rapidly within 2 h. The rapid deactivation is due to the formation of a graphitic layer on Ni particles which is confirmed by TEM measurement and DFT modeling work shown in the following sections. Upon the addition of Pd (0.52 wt%, 20Ni–1Pd/CNT), methane conversion remains stable for 6 h. An optimum Pd loading is found to be between 0.52 wt% and 1.8 wt% for the CNT-supported catalysts, which corresponds to 20Ni–1Pd and 5Ni–1Pd, respectively. Further increase in Pd loading is detrimental to the catalytic activity (e.g., 1Ni–1Pd/CNT). Similarly, the unsupported catalysts also show high and stable performance with an optimum Pd loading between 10Ni–1Pd and 5Ni–1Pd (Fig. 4a, zone IV). It is noted that the use of CNTs significantly decreases the requirement on total metal loading from 100 wt% to 11 wt%. Fig. 4b summarizes the TCD activity as a function of the Ni:Pd mass ratio for both CNT-supported and unsupported catalysts. The data were taken at 1 h time-on-stream. The use of the CNT-support improves metal particle dispersion whereas the addition of Pd to Ni helps to stabilize metal particles and inhibit the termination of the CNT growth due to coking.45,46 More detailed discussion on the TCD mechanism is presented in the DFT modeling work in the following section.
 Fig. 4  a) CH4 conversion over CNT-supported and unsupported catalysts with different Ni–Pd mass ratios. TCD reaction conditions: 600 °C, 30 mol% CH4/N2. The graph is divided into four zones based on the conversion values of the catalysts, from low to high. b) CH4 conversion as a function of Ni:Pd mass ratios at 1 h time-on-stream. c) Effect of temperature on CH4 conversion on 10Ni–1Pd/CNT. d) Effect of the CH4 molar fraction in the feedstock on catalyst performance at 600 °C. e) Feasibility test of cyclic reaction–regeneration for 5 cycles. 

Fig. 4c depicts the effect of reaction temperature on the stability of 10Ni–1Pd/CNT. The activity remains stable for over 6 h when the reaction temperature is lower than 600 °C but deactivates within 1 h when the reaction temperature is over 650 °C. At temperatures above 650 °C, the pure nickel catalyst was deactivated due to the fact that the methane dissociation rate was faster than the carbon diffusion rate, resulting in the encapsulation of nickel particles by graphitic layers.47,48Fig. 4d shows the catalytic activity of 10Ni–1Pd/CNT with the varying CH4 molar fraction from 30% to 100% at 600 °C. Although the conversion decreases with the increase in CH4 concentration, the hydrogen production rate increases indicating the CH4 conversion rate (moles CH4 converted per h) is increasing. Even at 100% concentration of methane, the methane conversion remains stable at 35%.
The feasibility of cyclic reaction–regeneration as described in Fig. 1 was examined using the 10Ni–1Pd/CNT catalyst. Fig. 4e depicts the catalytic stability of 10Ni–1Pd/CNT for five cycles of operation. Fig. 1 shows one complete cycle. In each cycle, a portion of the carbon product (CNTs/CNFs) was taken after leaching out Ni–Pd with nitric acid. Ni and Pd are re-introduced using fresh Ni–Pd nitrate. Practically, we could use the Ni–Pd nitrate solution from the acid wash, but the evaporation took a long time in laboratory setting. It is worth noting that the solubility of multi-walled CNTs in nitric acid was considered low. In each cycle, we took a fraction of product carbon as the support to reload metals. During the TCD, these carbon supports were mixed with the new carbon product and diluted. The amounts of carbons that undergo repeatedly acid washing were less. Results shown in Fig. 4e indicate that the catalytic activity can be recovered after each cycle of regeneration. Although the concept of using the as-produced CNT product as the support for making catalysts was mentioned in the literature,10 to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report that experimentally demonstrates the feasibility of in-process catalyst regeneration for the self-sustained TCD process. The properties of CNTs/CNFs from cycles 1, 3 and 5 are described in the next section. Our experiment was carried out in a fixed-bed configuration using a quartz tube reactor. Typically, the pyrolysis reaction was operated for six hours when the pressure started to build up. However, if bubbling bed reactors were used, the catalytic pyrolysis could be operated for a much longer time. The long operation duration is important for commercial practice, it saves capital and operating costs.
3.3. Characterization of the spent catalyst and carbon products
The morphologies of the spent Ni/CNT and 10Ni–1Pd/CNT catalysts are depicted in Fig. 5(a–c). Shown in Fig. 5a is the coke formation on Ni particles over the Ni/CNT catalyst, which explains the rapid deactivation of Ni/CNT in TCD (Fig. 4a). The carbon product on Ni/CNT appears to be multi-walled CNTs which appear to have a hollow cylindrical shape. For CNT-supported Ni–Pd alloy catalysts, the carbon products consist of mainly CNFs as shown in Fig. 5b and c. Fig. 5c shows the spent catalyst taken from the 5th cycle. This sample contains CNT products taken from previous 4 cycles. Results from Fig. 5c indicate that the CNF formed from each cycle does not show any obvious difference in morphology.
 Fig. 5  a) TEM image of coke formation over Ni/CNT. b) TEM image of thick-walled CNTs and CNFs over 10Ni–1Pd/CNT. c) CNFs after the 5th cycle. d) TGA analysis with the oxidation temperature up to 900 °C. e) Raman patterns of the pristine, acid treated CNTs and the spent catalysts after the 1st, 3rd, and 5th cycles. 
It is worth noting that, in the Ni–Pd–CNT catalyst system, very small metal particles do not tend to show catalytic activity. Fig. S6† shows that spent 10Ni–1Pd/CNT and Pd/CNT with a particle size less than its critical value do not grow CNTs or CNFs. In contrast, larger Ni–Pd particles produce large CNFs as shown in Fig. S6b.† One explanation is that, compared with larger particles, the deactivation over small particles is due to the “overfeeding” of carbon atoms from CH4 which causes thin carbon layer formation on the surface preventing further CNT nucleation.49 Fig. S7† shows the SEM images of spent unsupported Ni, 10Ni–1Pd and 15Ni–1Pd catalysts. Fig. S8† shows the Raman spectra of unsupported Ni–Pd catalysts.
The crystallinity of the produced carbon was examined using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Fig. 5d shows that the oxidation temperatures of the CNT-supported catalysts are higher than 500 °C, implying that the produced carbon is crystalline because amorphous carbon is oxidized at a temperature less than 400 °C. Raman spectroscopy was used to determine the degree of crystallinity of the produced carbon by monitoring the ratio between the D-band (1345 cm−1) and G-band (1578 cm−1).50 As shown in Fig. 5e, the ID/IG ratios are between 1.4 and 1.6 for CNTs recovered from cycles 1, 3 and 5, indicating the reaction–regeneration cycles do not affect the crystallinity of carbon products.
3.4. Mechanistic understandings from the computational investigation
To understand the role of Pd in the Ni–Pd bimetallic system for the varied catalytic activity, ab initio microkinetic modeling (MKM) in conjunction with density functional theory (DFT) was applied to investigate the intrinsic CH4 decomposition rates over Ni, Ni3Pd, and Pd (among other metals). More information about the DFT and MKM methods can be found in the ESI.†

Fig. 6a shows the activation energy barrier of breaking four C–H bonds and C2 formation over Ni, Ni3Pd, and Pd surfaces. As can be seen in Fig. 6a, all three catalyst surfaces have similar energy profiles with similar activation barriers for C–H bond dissociation and C–C coupling reaction. However, the formation of C2 species (C2 + 8H) is more favorable over the Ni(111) surface (1.42 eV) compared to the Pd(111) and Ni3Pd(111) surface (2.12 eV and 1.82 eV, respectively). Incorporating the DFT data of the energy barrier of each step, Fig. 6b shows the MKM results of the activity as a contour plot, using the binding energies of C and C2 species as the two descriptors.51,52 Among all the metals, Ni is the most active with a TOF of ∼ 0.1 s−1; however, Ni3Pd and Pd are ≈3 and 5 orders of magnitude less active, a TOF of ∼ 10−4 and ∼10−6 s−1, respectively. This calculation reflects intrinsic kinetics.

Reaction conditions were 600 °C, 1 bar CH4, and conversion of 0.01%.

To understand the higher stability of Ni–Pd alloy catalysts towards coke formation compared to Ni, DFT modeling work was carried out. As previously shown, though Ni/CNT shows the highest initial methane conversion, it deactivates very quickly due to coke formation, whereas the Ni–Pd–CNT catalyst shows a stable conversion of methane for ∼6 h. While the C2 formation is considered the precursor for carbon encapsulation (i.e., active site deactivation) and coke formation, the dissolution and migration of surface atomic carbon in the metal sublayer is considered the key step towards the formation of CNTs/CNFs53–56 and stability. Therefore, we evaluated over Ni and Ni3Pd(111) surfaces using DFT modeling to calculate energies for atomic carbon dissolution and C2 formation to unravel the role of Pd.
As shown in Fig. 7, the carbon atoms bind strongly to both the Ni(111) and Ni3Pd(111) surfaces with similar binding energies of −6.15 eV (Fig. 7a) and −6.32 eV (Fig. 7a′), respectively. At higher coverage 0.5 ML, the binding energies of the two carbons over Ni(111) and Ni3Pd(111) are calculated to be −10.97 eV and −11.72 eV, respectively (Fig. 7b and b′). Due to the high reaction temperature and high methane gas concentration, reasonably high coverage of C is expected on the metal surfaces. These two carbons adsorbed on the surface can either undergo C–C coupling to form C2 species (Fig. 7c and c′ for Ni and Ni3Pd, respectively), or they can diffuse to the sub-layer of the metal surface (Fig. 7(d → e) and (d′ → e′) for Ni and Ni3Pd, respectively). The diffusion of carbon from the surface to the sublayer is energetically favorable for both Ni and Ni3Pd by −1.68 eV (Fig. 7b → d) and −1.27 eV (Fig. 7b′ → d′), respectively. A similar observation was made by Abild-Pedersen et al.,57 Harpale et al.,39 and Gili et al.41 The energy gain from the diffusion of the second carbon to the first sublayer is favorable only by −0.18 eV for Ni3Pd (Fig. 7d′ → e′), whereas it is unfavorable for Ni (ΔE = +0.03 eV, Fig. 7d → e). The diffusion of carbon from the first sublayer to the second sublayer were found to be unfavorable for both Ni(111) and Ni3Pd(111) by 0.25 eV and 0.09 eV, respectively, as shown in Fig. S10.†
 Fig. 7  DFT calculated energies for the competing routs for C2 formation vs. the dissolution of carbon over Ni(111) [top] (a–e) and Ni3Pd(111) [bottom] (a′–e′) surfaces. Favorable routes are marked with green arrows. All the binding energies given below the geometries are in eV. More information about the calculations of the formation and diffusion energies can be found in the ESI† (section S2). 
The formation of C2 from the surface adsorbed C atoms is more energetically favorable for Ni at −1.89 eV (Fig. 7b → c) than for Ni3Pd at −1.07 eV (Fig. 7b′ → c′). These results suggest that the formation of graphitic layers on the Ni surface is more favorable, which is consistent with our stability and characterization results that show the pure Ni particles covered by graphitic layers. However, the diffusion of C in the metal sublayer required for CNT growth is more favorable for Ni3Pd at −1.27 eV (Fig. 7b′ → d′) than the C2 formation at −1.07 eV (Fig. 7b′ → d′), suggesting that the buildup of carbon in the metal sublayer (i.e., the carbon required for CNT growth) is more favorable. This is also consistent with our experimental results that show how the addition of Pd to Ni(1) stabilizes the CH4 TCD performance and (2) favors CNT growth because the formation of the precursor for CNT growth (sub-layered C) is more energetically favorable than the formation of the coke precursor (C2).
3.5. Preliminary technoeconomic analysis
Preliminary technoeconomic analysis was conducted by comparing TCD with commercial steam methane reforming with and without CO2 capture. Major advantages of TCD are the near zero CO2 emission and high value by-products CNTs/CNFs. Results are summarized in the ESI.†
4. Conclusions
Ni and Ni–Pd alloy supported on CNTs with various atomic ratios were synthesized and tested for methane TCD. It was demonstrated that the introduction of Pd significantly affected the physicochemical properties of the catalyst and formation mechanisms of carbon materials. The methane conversion and carbon yield of the catalysts were highly dependent on the Ni/Pd ratio and reaction temperature. Pure Ni catalysts deactivated within 2 h of reaction due to graphitic carbon encapsulation. The supported and unsupported Ni–Pd alloy catalysts exhibited an improved sintering resistance and stable operation for 6 h. An optimum Ni:Pd mass ratio between 10 and 15 was experimentally determined. DFT and MKM calculations revealed that the pure Ni catalyst deactivated most likely due to preferred formation and accumulation of coke precursors (C2) over the metal surface. However, the Ni–Pd catalysts were more stable due to the lower energy of carbon migrating to the metal sublayer favoring CNT growth. The cyclic reaction–regeneration for the self-sustained process was demonstrated by re-synthesizing the 10Ni–1Pd/CNT catalyst using the produced CNTs/CNFs as a support after leaching out the metal. After five cycles of operation, the properties of the CNT/CNF product remained unchanged.
