In addition to the typical physicochemical forces to be considered during crystallization, mesoporous thin films are also affected by the substrate–film relationship and the mesostructure. The substrate can influence the crystallization temperature and the obtained crystallographic orientation due to the interfacial energies and the lattice mismatch. The mesostructure can influence the crystallite orientation, and affects nucleation and growth behavior due to the wall thickness and pore curvature. Three main methods are presented and discussed: templated mesoporosity followed by thermally induced crystallization, mesostructuration of already crystallized metal oxide nanobuilding units and substrate-directed crystallization with an emphasis on very recent results concerning epitaxially grown piezoelectric structured α-quartz films via crystallization of amorphous structured SiO2 thin films.Adrian Carretero-GenevrierAdrián Carretero Genevrier is a permanent CNRS researcher at the Institute of Nanotechnology in Lyon (INL).

I. Introduction
The synergetic coupling between inorganic or hybrid sol–gel chemistry, soft matter physics, and smart processing has opened new avenues for advanced materials research.1 In the past ten years, an increasing quantity of mesostructured materials with very diverse chemical compositions (oxides,2 metals,3 carbons,4 chalcogenides,5 semi-conductors,6etc.) deposited as thin films have appeared, and the reader is referred to some excellent reviews of such materials.7–17 The crystallization of inorganic structured materials presents a variety of challenges. Here we will be discussing the preparation of and theory behind mesostructured crystalline metal oxides and SiO2 thin films. Additionally, this short review describes some relevant research directions that still must be developed in more depth to produce new insights into this young field.
Among mesostructured materials, metal oxides are inexpensive, stable, and mostly nontoxic and present a large set of interesting optical, electronic, and magnetic properties that open access to promising applications such as low-k materials, membranes and separation devices, functional smart coatings, fuel and solar cells, microbatteries, catalysts, sensors, and others.12,18–20 The physical responses and thus the properties of many metal oxides are strongly dependent on their size, shape, morphology, crystallinity, and exposed crystallographic faces.21–23 Examples of physical properties arising from crystallization include: magnetism,24 piezoelectricity,25,26 sorption behavior,27 photocatalytic activity,28,29 and increased material stability over the amorphous counterpart.30 Therefore the controlled design of mesoscopically architectured nanocrystalline metal oxide thin films is of paramount importance.
Three main strategies depicted in Fig. 1 can be used to structure crystalline films via solution deposition techniques: (i) electroless chemical etching of a crystalline substrate,31 (ii) assembly of crystalline nanobuilding blocks (NBBs) via evaporation induced self-assembly (EISA),32–34 and (iii) crystallization of pre-assembled structures35 (Fig. 1). We will not cover non-solution routes to form mesoporous crystalline films in this review.36 Typical transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images representing the state of the art in mesoscopically architectured nanocrystalline metal oxide films are also displayed in Fig. 1. These three methods all present advantages and limitations.
 Fig. 1  Three chemical solution methods to create mesoporous materials. (a) Chemical etching is performed to drill into a metallic film, which is then oxidized to form a mesostructured metal oxide. The SEM (left) and TEM (right) images are from a silicon substrate patterned with Ag, and then etched in dilute hydrofluoric acid to produce mesoporous nanowires. Microscopy images are reproduced with permission from ref. 37. (b) Nanobuilding blocks are aggregated around micelles through EISA before organic matter is removed, often through thermal decomposition. The SEM (left) and TEM (right) images show a Nb doped anatase TiO2 film prepared from pre-crystallized particles assembled with Pluronic F127. Microscopy images are reproduced with permission from ref. 38. (c) Deposition of hydrolyzed molecular precursors, originating from molecules such as Si(OEt)4 and TiCl4, along with a self-assembling surfactant can lead to ordered mesoporosity. In the TEM images ZnTiO3 templated with Pluronic F127 is viewed from the [110] and [001] directions. Microscopy images are reproduced with permission from ref. 39. 
Metal assisted chemical etching requires two steps. First metallic domains or nanoparticles are deposited onto a crystalline substrate via physical or chemical processing. Then the patterned substrate is submerged in an etching solution. The crystalline substrate is stable in the etchant, but the substrate in contact with the metal is oxidized and then dissolved (Fig. 1a). Non-electrolytic chemical etching can be easily performed, and various 2D shapes can be created related to the morphology and arrangement of the deposited metal nanoparticles. The doping and crystallographic orientation of the substrate are pre-optimized. But, as this technique depends on preferential etching along a particular crystallographic direction, the morphology can be controllably tailored only in 2 directions and currently is limited to Si, SiGe, SiC, Ge, GaAs and GaN substrates. The remaining material can (and often naturally does) convert to the corresponding oxide after etching is completed. This topic has been thoroughly discussed in a recent review.40
The assembly of crystalline NBBs consists of synthesizing and crystallizing nanoparticles and then depositing them along with a structure directing agent on a substrate (Fig. 1b). This approach allows one to tune the size, chemical composition, crystallinity and particle shape of the inorganic components, as long as the post-thermal treatment step is mild enough to avoid extensive sintering and loss of porosity. When NBBs are coupled with amphiphilic templates, their size should be tailored to the size of the hydrophilic component of the template.33 A critical nanoparticle size in relation to the micelle diameter must not be exceeded to avoid production of inhomogeneous structures.41
The post-crystallization method is the most common approach to mesostructured crystalline thin films via solution deposition. Typically this route entails the EISA of metal oxide precursors around amphiphilic organic constructs, followed by thermally induced crystallization and template removal (Fig. 1c). The mesostructure is highly dependent on the solution chemistry (porogen/precursor ratio, acidity) and processing conditions (humidity, temperature, aging, etc.).42,43 The chemistry of surfactants and block copolymers plays a major role in the stability of the mesostructure during crystallization. Amorphous mesoporous materials of an impressive variety of architectures, mesopore sizes, and chemical compositions can be obtained.44 Crystallization of these preassembled nanostructures often leads to loss of porosity, inhomogeneous nucleation and crystal growth, and reorganization of the mesostructure during thermal or pressurized treatment. This architectural destruction is due to the fact that in many oxides the activation energy of crystallization is higher than that of structural reorganization.45
The strategies described in the present review are all based on thin film deposition of sol–gel derived solutions. Most of the successful routes implement the sol–gel chemistry of highly charged inorganic ions that lead to amorphous-locally ordered NBBs, in the absence of anionic competitors that can form non-oxide basic salts, typical of M(II) oxides. Because of the presence of a substrate, a template or the inherent heterogeneities of colloidal solutions, the nucleation step of crystallization can be generally considered as heterogeneous. To shed light on some selected advances in the field, and for the sake of clarity, this review is split into three main subtopics: (i) templated mesostructuration followed by a crystallization step, (ii) mesostructuration of already crystallized particles and (iii) substrate-directed crystallization, with an emphasis on very recent results that concern epitaxially grown piezoelectric quartz films.25,26 The fundamental aspects and synthetic techniques will be presented without going into an exhaustive list of materials due to the fact that not all oxides are easily processed into mesoscopically architectured crystalline thin films using solution based chemistry. Other physical deposition/ablation methods to synthesize nanostructured oxide films will not be discussed as they have been well reviewed elsewhere.46,47
II. Background
Ordered pore arrays with controllable pitch and pore size can be obtained by surfactant templating through EISA.48 EISA consists of depositing a solution containing metal oxide precursors and porogens (e.g. amphiphilic block copolymers, surfactants) dispersed in a volatile solvent which self-assemble into periodic structures during solvent evaporation. Often water is present in the initial solution to hydrolyze the metal oxide precursors, and acid is typically either added or generated by hydrolysis, slowing the precursor condensation rate. Other ligands may be added to inhibit premature condensation, particularly acetyl acetone.49,50 Once a stable solution of miscible species is obtained and aged for the appropriate amount of time, the solution is deposited as a thin film typically using either spin,51 spray,52 or dip coating (Fig. 2).53,54 Evaporation begins to evolve the structure within seconds of film deposition.42,55 Dip coating tends to generate the most homogeneous films over a large surface compared to the other techniques for materials cast from sol–gel solutions, and hence it is the most frequently used method. A successful deposition depends upon a good degree of wetting. If the solution dewets from the substrate surface, islands of inhomogeneous material will be deposited. Dewetting results from high surface tension and can be circumvented by changing the quantity of water (typically increasing alcohol content) or by changing the hydrophobicity (via fluorination, organic modification of the surface or deposition of an inorganic barrier layer) or hydrophilicity (by using heat or acid to oxidize the surface). EISA has been used to prepare mesoporous crystalline thin films of a large variety of oxides (Table 1).
 Fig. 2  Preparation followed by thermally induced crystallization of mesoporous thin films from deposition of a film of block copolymers (BCPs) and inorganic precursors/nanobuilding blocks (I). Here a deposition of two layers of micelles is depicted, though anywhere between a monolayer and over a dozen layers can be deposited in a single coating.

Several strategies exist to prevent structural collapse during the crystallization of mesoporous thin films. The crystallite to pore size ratio is very important: if the crystallite size becomes larger than the pore size, the mesostructure is usually lost. Crystal growth is limited by feed stock, thus if the pore:wall diameter ratio is correct, the morphology can be maintained. In some cases, additives can be used to increase the homogeneity of nucleation.25,26 Crystallization treatment (temperature, duration, pressure) can be varied to optimize the crystal nucleation and the average final crystal size. Using non-combustible templates coupled with a reducing gas during heat treatment can also retard crystal growth by limiting diffusive sintering.115 For example, some surfactants carbonize, thus providing mechanical support during the crystallization process. An alternative option is to use optimized heat treatment conditions. For example, prolonged heat treatment at the maximum temperature before the onset of crystallization stabilizes the amorphous network by increasing the activation energy of structural rearrangement.50,79,84,90 Rapid thermal annealing at high temperature can well preserve the structure by taking advantage of the higher kinetic rate of crystallization over structural rearrangement.85,116 Another strategy consists of mixing two oxides to inhibit crystallite growth and then to control their size38,117 or stabilizing a crystallizable oxide (e.g. TiO2) with an amorphous oxide (e.g. SiO2).118 A final consideration is the hydrophobicity of the micellar core, as weakly hydrophobic cores can solvate inorganic nanobuilding blocks, leading to crystal nucleation within the micelle and subsequent structural collapse.119
To obtain a homogeneous and well-ordered mesoporous thin film from an ethanolic/aqueous solution, it is best to use a substrate with a high surface energy, such as Si with a native oxide layer (0.14 J m−2) or TiO2 (0.280–0.380 J m−2) rather than glass (0.06–0.08 J m−2) or ITO coated glass (0.05 J m−2).120
Cracks are sometimes formed when films need to relieve mechanical stress induced by the contraction of the sol–gel network during condensation (that is during its drying and/or thermal treatments). The mechanical stress of a supported film increases with its thickness. If the ratio (cohesive strength)/(adhesion strength) is high, the layer delaminates. If it is low, the layer cracks due to inhomogeneities in capillary forces. A slow and progressive thermal treatment and/or slow evaporation rate (e.g. using a solvent of higher boiling point, increasing the humidity and/or lowering the temperature in the dip-coating chamber) can give the film time to reorganize without cracking.120 For example, the use of 1-butanol in place of ethanol avoided cracking.96 Cracks can also be avoided by adding nanoparticle fillers such as Degussa P25, which decreases the global contraction of the mesostructure and thus decreases the stresses.121–123
Film characterization depends principally on grazing incidence small angle X-ray scattering (GI-SAXS) and ellipsometry. GI-SAXS is used to determine the d-spacing and pore symmetry from the analysis of the diffraction patterns. Ellipsometry gives information about the refractive index, thus the film thickness and crystallinity, but also can be used in conjunction with solvent sorption to give information about pore size distribution.124 Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) give information about the topology, where grated films can be imaged using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). To assess the crystallinity, selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns and wide angle X-ray diffraction (WAXS) are typically used.
III. Nanostructuration followed by crystallization
The mesostructuration of amorphous oxides, followed by crystallization, has been studied in depth and is well-understood. The self-assembly during evaporation occurs through complex interactions between solvent, precursors and template species, which can be described using free energy terms.125 Free energy terms for molecular interactions between organic–inorganic species (ΔGinter), organic–organic species (ΔGorg), inorganic–inorganic species (ΔGinorg) and the solvent (ΔGsol) all contribute to the organization within the solution (eqn (1)): ΔG = ΔGinter(A, ρinor, ρorg,…) + ΔGorg(A, ρinor,…) + ΔGinorg(ρinor) + ΔGsol(1)
As portions of the free energy terms are dynamic, depending on the species' charge distribution and physical state (ρ), and as the inorganic species polymerize and the solvent evaporates, the organization will also evolve. Templates are typically block copolymers (e.g. Pluronics) or molecular surfactant species (e.g. Brij, CTAB), with the requirement that a hydrophobic tail is attached to either a polar head having area (A) which can interact with the inorganic species. In the case of Pluronics and Brij, the polyethylene oxide (PEO) block is likely complexing the inorganic species. There is some evidence that Ti(IV) acts to crosslink the PEO micelle shell.126 As the Pluronics are bitailed surfactants the ΔGorg becomes a more important factor due to the van der Waals interactions that give additional stability to the formation of micelles. The hydrophobicity of the tail plays a significant role in micelle formation.127 Micelles may be preformed in solution, or formed when the critical micelle concentration is reached during solvent evaporation, though in all cases with EISA, cooperative templating occurs and the structural organization evolves during drying. The evaporation rate is of course very important because it determines how much time the solutes have to organize and, in the capillary deposition regime, how much material is deposited.128 The condensation of metal oxides usually takes several minutes to complete and aging under the appropriate conditions can significantly improve the periodicity of the film.84,127 This rearrangement is due to the decrease in the charge of the species during condensation129 and the equilibrium water content dissolved in the film and in the air. However the evaporative conditions during the deposition also play a strong role. Thus the evaporation rate is controlled using temperature, humidity and solvent volatility.
The crystallization of amorphous mesostructured films has a major drawback, which is that crystallization and/or sintering can destroy the pore structure.100 The wall:pore ratio is important. It was shown that a cubic pore structure, with walls of 10–12 nm, was able to crystallize and maintain porosity where the 2D-hexagonal pore structure with walls of 7 nm degraded at the onset of crystallization.84 In order to create thicker walls, it is possible to lower the template:inorganic precursor ratio by changing the solvent.96 When pentanol or butanol is used instead of ethanol, the cmc for most ionic and nonionic surfactants is lowered and thus less organic matter can be used to produce porous structures with thick walls, which can in turn be crystallized without structural degradation.
During thermal treatment, the volume of the metal oxide contracts as organization of the crystal lattice takes place. In an organized porous thin film, the pores are also contracted, however not uniformly leading to anisotropic mesoporosity (Fig. 3).56 The anisotropy arises from the attachment between the thin film and the substrate. Many substrates are already crystalline, thus no significant structural rearrangement is expected during thermal treatment and the substrate will hold the form of the structure in the x,y-plane, forcing contraction to occur almost exclusively in the z-direction. The distortion of the matrix during calcination and the dimensions of the ellipsoidal pores has been studied for alumina going from amorphous through different crystal phases using GI-SAXS and ellipsometric porosimetry.56 The accessibility, organization and interconnectivity of mesopore structures are maintained in Al2O3 throughout the crystallization. This contraction, combined with structural reorganization during calcination, can lead to the formation of nanopillar pore structures as pore openings merge and walls densify.51,98
 Fig. 3  Contraction of Al2O3 films during calcination to produce crystalline anisotropic fcc mesopores. The differences in lattice spacing can be observed by comparing TEM images of the top view (central image, scale bar 50 nm) to the cross-sectional view (right-side image, scale bar 25 nm).

An in-depth investigation of the kinetics and thermodynamics of crystallization in mesoporous and dense TiO2 thin films has been carried out using in situ thermal ellipsometric analysis.130 The transition from amorphous to crystalline titania leads to first an increase in refractive index (RI) from 2.00 to 2.35 at the wavelength of 700 nm in dense films. In mesoporous films, the porosity decreases the refractive index due to the contribution from air, but the same increase in RI is initially observed upon heating. Upon continued heating, decreases in refractive index are then observed, correlating with an increase in porosity due to pore coalescence during TiO2 densification. The effect of heating rate, humidity, solution aging, film thickness, substrate dilatation coefficients, mesopore order and acidity on crystallization were all examined (Table 2). Highly ordered films, such as the cubic mesopore structure, showed decreased diffusion of TiO2 compared to poorly ordered or dense films, leading to higher energy barriers to crystallization and crystal growth in the ordered film. However, highly crystalline and porous films were obtained upon heating to higher temperatures (630 °C in this case). This work proved also that, as opposed to dense films, a film exhibiting a well ordered mesoporosity created TiO2 domains of similar size. The result of this monodispersity in nanocrystals is that the resulting films present a very good thermal stability due to limited Ostwald ripening during crystal growth. Mesopores affect crystallization by increasing the surface energy, adding capillary stresses due to the high-curvature of the pores (thus more effectively occluding water, templates and residual carbon) and confining the growth of nanocrystals.

To summarize, the morphology of the mesopores affects the crystallization behavior, changing the onset of crystallization temperature, the crystallite size and even the crystal phase. Processing (choice of surfactant, substrate, solvent, chemical ratio, evaporation rate, deposition conditions, post-deposition treatment, etc.) can be used to master control over the morphology, which will in turn impact the crystallization dynamics. Some inorganic precursors can crosslink the shell of some micelles, freezing the micelle morphology even before micelle packing on the substrate during film drying.126 During heat treatment, the inorganic species will densify and undergo diffusive sintering, limited by the pore structure of the film, the heat treatment time and temperature. During densification, the film shrinks anisotropically, as the attachment to the substrate prevents significant contraction parallel to the wafer. Thus the substrate, processing conditions and mesostructure are all interrelated with final crystallinity.
IV. Nanostructuration of crystallized particles
Nanostructuration followed by crystallization is an excellent method for most materials. However, the formation of nanocrystals followed by mesostructuration by dip-coating the sol with appropriate block copolymers has been proven to be desirable for the formation of doped materials, such as Nb doped TiO2 and Sb doped SnO2.38,131 Pre-crystallization avoids collapse of the mesostructure upon crystallization and thermal degradation of the templates.132–134 This route is also interesting for applications where control over particle size is paramount or when the substrate is temperature-sensitive.135 In pure titania, primary particles of 2–8 nm of anatase and brookite are formed and agglomerate through standard sol–gel chemistry, followed by dissolution of larger aggregates via peptidization. These nanobuilding blocks are then assembled around micelles during deposition onto a substrate.136 The main benefits include control over particle size and doping, as these are often linked to the calcination program. The calcination program is in turn at least partially dependent on the decomposition temperature of the templates. However, to successfully mesostructure the film, the crystalline particles must be significantly smaller than the micelles, with narrow particle size distribution, and should be well dispersed in the relevant solvents. Also the temperature and aging time of peptidization must be precise to control the colloid size.137
For example, some titania nanocrystals can be formed from TiCl4 in dry organic solvents by heating to 80 °C for 9 h in a loosely sealed vessel.132 The titania sol was combined with amphiphilic KLE block copolymers and dip-coated to produce mesoporous thin films. The same block copolymers were used with titanium precursors under standard EISA conditions to compare the pre- and post-crystallization methods. Anatase appeared in the post-crystallized film at 500 °C with 100% crystallinity occurring by 600 °C. In the pre-crystallized film, anatase grain growth could be observed from the decomposition temperature of the template (400 °C) up to 900 °C. The presence of rutile was not observed in either film. The significant difference between the films prepared via pre- and post-crystallization was that pre-crystallized films demonstrated crystallographically oriented nanocrystals, albeit with a low degree of orientation, whereas the post-crystallized titania leads to completely random orientation for all reported substrates.
Although it looks very simple, this approach requires the use of small nanocrystals presenting a high surface reactivity which makes the unraveling of the real film formation mechanism not always straightforward. For example, in a study of mesoporous mixed ZrO2–TiO2, it was found that nanocrystalline building blocks were either formed in solution or in the initial drying of the film, which degraded into a mixed amorphous oxide upon aging in a humid environment.127 The higher the %RH, the faster the nanocrystals degraded. The degradation of the crystalline structure coincided with the growth of a mesoporous phase, indicating that nanobuilding blocks can act as a feed stock rather than as nanobricks around a porogen.
Ceria is a material that often suffers from mesopore collapse upon crystallization.134 Ceria sols were prepared by precipitating ammonium cerium nitrate in basic pH, followed by peptidization in 1:1 H2O–HNO3.138 Colloidal ceria was assembled into 3D mesostructured films by using crystalline sols. Mixtures of ethanol, water, amphiphilic block copolymer (poly(hydroxybutyrate)–poly(ethylene oxide), PHB–PEO) and ceria nanoparticles (∼3 nm) were deposited using dip-coating. The ethanol–water ratio was critical as in highly aqueous media the gelation of particles occurred faster than the structuration process. Only very specific synthetic conditions allowed the formation of highly ordered, porous and crystalline thin films with mesopores of ∼11 nm separated by a double layer of particles, that is walls of 6–7 nm.
Ortel et al. did a comparative study between the assembly of nanobuilding blocks and TiCl4 around laboratory-made block copolymers.32 Compared to the precursor, the use of NBBs generated pore structures that were less well-defined, due to the difficulty assembling the preformed nano-objects around the micelles. The NBB approach produced a high degree of roughness that increased the surface area substantially. As could be intuitively predicted, when NBBs are used instead of TiCl4, the anisotropic film shrinkage (Fig. 4) is much less pronounced. For instance, calcined films produced from PEO213–PB184–PEO213–TiCl4 had final pore dimensions of 21 × 5 nm, where the PEO213–PB184–PEO213–NBB system had pore dimensions of 17 × 13 nm. Thus shrinkage in films produced from NBBs is more homogeneous in all 3 dimensions.

Hartmann et al. compared the photoelectric properties of mesoporous titania thin films prepared via EISA of surfactants and TiCl4 and pre-formed TiO2 NBBs.139 The films prepared from NBBs had two times higher surface area and a more accessible surface due to larger pore openings. However, the quantum efficiency (incident photon capture efficiency, IPCE) was an order of magnitude higher for the sol–gel films. The explanation for this unexpectedly high photon conversion efficiency in the sol–gel derived film is that there is a lower fraction of grain boundaries and more direct electron pathways than in the film constructed from NBBs.
V. Surfactant mediated iso-oriented crystals and mesopore morphology
Surfactants are able to induce both crystallite and pore alignment. They play a role in determining the morphology, pore accessibility, diffusion and performance in applications. Oriented pore arrays may be obtained by surfactant–substrate interactions,140 photo-induced polymer orientation,141 sheer flows142 and magnetic processing,17 and they can also be formed by mastering surfactant assembly dynamics. The physicochemical interactions between the surfactant and inorganic precursors/particles should therefore be understood in detail.
The EISA generation of porous oxides uses a non-expensive methodology stemming from depositing a solution of block copolymers or surfactants and inorganic precursors on a substrate. The micelles interact with the substrate regardless of its hydrophilic or hydrophobic character due to their amphiphilicity. However, the resulting pore morphology depends upon the micelle–substrate interaction.143,144 In the case of hydrophilic substrates, favorable interactions with the micelle may be obtained through hexagonal pore arrays lying in the plane.140 When the substrate is hydrophobic, hemi-micelles deposit on the surface.140,145 In an interesting example, poly-(hexamethylenepyromellitimide) (PI) was used as a substrate because it has an anisotropic structure that can be aligned in a particular direction with rubbing.146 Micelles of long chain surfactant aligned themselves with the PI interface, which elongated the micelle spacing and drastically changed the crystallographic orientation of the hexagonal mesostructured silica formed therefrom.
Vertical pore arrays may be desirable so that the channels that exist connect the solution to the substrate via the film,57,147 and because they can generate anisotropic photoluminesce.148 This morphology is typically not observed because other available structures are energetically more favorable. However, vertical pores have been obtained by using a patterned surface (Fig. 5).149 The patterned surface was deposited by coating the substrate with a cubic pore organization in titania, which presents hexagonal morphology on the top layer. A second hexagonal phase was then deposited using silica, this time with hexagonal pores running vertically. To obtain a good match between the titania and silica lattices, pitch was tuned through either a careful selection of block copolymer templates, or through swelling of the hexagonal pore templates with non-polar solvents. The formation of the hexagonal layer must be kinetically slow so that there is time for the micelles to arrange on the patterned substrate, thus explaining the use of silica as the second layer. The authors of this study noticed that close to the substrate, the epitaxial interactions are strong and can force organization even when the lattice match is rather poor with disorder becoming more apparent with distance from the substrate (Fig. 5c).

Two additional routes to obtaining vertical pore alignment have been reported. The first uses patterned substrates that induce a particular surfactant assembly (e.g. a conical shape drilled into the substrate), that then propagates vertical pore alignment through the film thanks to epitaxy.150,151 The second consists of using π–π interactions between the template and the substrate, as was obtained through assembly of liquid crystalline arrays of conjugated polyaromatic compounds interacting with a highly oriented pyrolytic graphite wafer.152 Although these reports concern the formation of amorphous silica,150–152 other oxides that crystallize via calcination could be performed with vertical mesopores through this technique.
Surfactants have been used to mediate the oriented nucleation of crystallites with anisotropic unit cells, including MoO3, Nb2O5, Ta2O5, TaNbO5, V2O5 and LiTaO3 (Fig. 6).76,153 These crystallites have uniaxial oriented nanocrystals relative to the substrate with crystallite size and orientation coupled to the mesostructure.76 The crystal orientation is determined from the onset of nucleation. The pronounced epitaxial relationship can be ascribed to the directional van der Waals force, acting upon the crystallites which have alternating oxygen- and metal-rich sheets normal to the long b-axis (Fig. 6b). The polarization of the anisotropic unit cell thus maximizes van der Waals attraction to the surface by aligning in the orientation shown in Fig. 6b. For a reason not clear yet, the presence of surfactants lowers the crystallization temperature as compared to bulk matter.76 In fact, when the thermal energy (kT) is too high, random grain growth results, indicating the delicate contribution of mesostructuration to crystallization kinetics. Surfactants may also increase the surface mobility of species due to lubrication.153 At high surfactant concentration mesoporosity was observed and at low surfactant concentration a dense film was produced, but in both cases the oxide had epitaxial orientation. Perhaps the degradation of the surfactant leaves residual carbon as a barrier layer between the film and the substrate, thus allowing the van der Waals forces to act without competing effects from the epitaxial relationship with the substrate.76 This surface passivation might explain why iso-oriented crystals are observed on virtually any substrate.76 Moreover, the size of the crystallite was larger (40–45 nm) than the mesopore spacing (∼15 nm),73 generating mesopore arrays with straightened walls and elongated nanocrystals. The distinct shapes of the crystallites and of the mesopores mean that the crystallization did not affect the mesostructuration.

VI. Substrate-directed crystallization
The crystallinity of a thin film can be affected by the crystal lattice of the substrate on which it is deposited. The substrate can transfer its epitaxy, residual stresses and strain to the thin film, and the interfacial energies between the film and the substrate also affect the crystallization behavior. Another point to note is that sometimes the substrate will react chemically with the deposited film, requiring a buffer layer to prevent the oxide from becoming contaminated. The substrate additionally plays a role in wetting and cracking of the deposited film, as discussed previously (Section II. Background).
Mesoporous titania films were deposited on Si(111), a single crystal Pt and glass substrates.154 Heat treatment at 350 °C led to enhanced anatase crystallinity for films deposited on a Si(111) wafer, followed by a Pt substrate, as compared to that deposited on amorphous glass.154 This trend is explained by the fact that the crystalline structure of the substrate may offer heterogeneous nucleation sites, lowering the nucleation energy barrier. In line with this thinking, a comparison of the luminescence band intensities of these TiO2 films showed that the film deposited on Si(111) exhibited a higher density of surface defects (e.g. oxygen vacancies), whereas that deposited on Pt contained more interstitial Ti3+ sites.
A XANES study of the crystallization behavior of anatase on ITO and Si substrates found that only 50% of the thin film was crystalline on ITO after heat treatment at 500 °C for 1 h.91 By contrast, 90% of the thin film was crystalline upon heat treatment at 350 °C when a silicon substrate was used instead. The authors hypothesize that cations from ITO supported on glass migrate into the TiO2 film and stunt crystal growth through glass-like shells around growing particles. Supporting this point, a buffer layer of titania in between an ITO substrate and a mesoporous titania layer resulted in crystallization under conditions where a mesoporous coating without the buffer layer was amorphous.92 Additionally the authors probe the photocatalytic activity after different thermal treatments to show what happens with the actual properties even before extensive crystallization.91
Two crystallization studies have been conducted, one about nickel containing TiO2,155 and one about Bi2VO5.5,156 on Si(100) containing a native layer of SiO2 and after SiO2 removal with HF. In both cases the substrate containing the native SiO2 layer produced a more crystalline film than the stripped Si(100) substrate. In fact, the amorphous to crystalline phase transition occurred 150 °C lower when the native SiO2 layer was present.155 The substrate effect is attributed to the mismatch in the lattice constant between the thin film and the Si(100), which is decreased upon the incorporation of a SiO2 buffer layer. Moreover, the degree of Ni2+ incorporation into the TiO2 matrix was affected as apparently Ni2+ has differing solubility in anatase and rutile.155 As the substrate affected the anatase–rutile transition, it also affected the homogeneity and the temperature of Ni2+ incorporation into the matrix.
VII. Epitaxial quartz films
Once the organic precursors are decomposed during the thermal treatment, the substrate can act as a template for epitaxial growth. Therefore, substrates are a key component when growing high quality crystalline films. In this direction, it is important to select a suitable substrate in concordance with the crystallographic characteristics and goals of the nanostructured crystalline films.
There are some points to consider when choosing a substrate, including chemical compatibility with the structure to be grown, thermal expansion coefficients and thermal stability during the growth process.157 In addition, the lattice mismatch between structures is an important factor to take into account for epitaxial growth, which requires growth in a controlled crystallographic orientation.158 Thus, by considering all these contributing factors, it is possible to generate different nano-architectures by using the epitaxial relationship between similar crystallographic structures to advantage during the growth process. This growth mechanism permits soft chemistry to extend an oriented epitaxial growth to a variety of functional oxide nanostructures.157,159–161
Harnessing the epitaxy of the substrate to induce oriented crystal growth in another material can allow preparation of functional materials that are otherwise inaccessible. For example, Carretero-Genevrier et al. used silicon substrates to develop structured epitaxial piezoelectric quartz thin films (low α-quartz).25,162 These films were obtained through the EISA of a sol–gel solution dip-coated onto Si(100) substrates. The sol–gel solution contained partially hydrolyzed and condensed tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) as a quartz precursor. The quartz thickness was defined by the thickness of the amorphous film deposited and by the calcination conditions, allowing the generation of films much thinner than previously generated (10 μm minimum).163 The silica precursor solution contained a specific proportion of Sr2+, Ba2+ or Ca2+, incorporated as nitrate or chloride salts, which functioned as silica network modifiers.164–166 A homogeneous distribution of these alkaline earth metals within the amorphous silica allowed for the heterogeneous nucleation of crystalline quartz of sufficiently small crystallite size so as to preserve large mesostructures present within the amorphous films. The devitrificants Sr2+, Ba2+ and Ca2+ can either be included in the film in situ (Fig. 7) or during a secondary infiltration (Fig. 8), in both cases allowing for crystallization at relatively low temperatures.25 In this straight-forward approach, the low mismatch between the (100)-quartz plane and the crystalline (100)-silicon substrate induces the nucleation of α-quartz crystals at the silicon–silica interface during thermal treatment above 900 °C (5 hours in air at ambient pressure). As a consequence, the formation of an oriented polycrystalline α-quartz thin film is epitaxially selected by the crystallographic orientation of the (100)-silicon substrate. When the same protocol was applied to particles not in contact with a crystalline substrate, there was no orientation to the crystal planes.167 Moreover, the authors show that other polymorphs of silica do not exhibit a comparable mismatch with the silicon substrate, thus avoiding the stabilization of other crystalline silica phases during the thermal treatment (Fig. 7).

(3) Oriented columnar quartz crystallite growth within the (100)-silicon substrate, where the crystallization rate and depth are limited by oxygen diffusion. The HRTEM image of the α-quartz-Si interface along [001] exhibits the crystallinity of quartz on silicon. The melting agents (Ba2+, Sr2+ or Ca2+, blue spheres), used to devitrify amorphous silica, migrate from the interior of the film during quartz formation to the crystal boundaries. The figure is reproduced with permission from images appearing in ref. 25.

Top-view and cross-sectional SEM images of the amorphous mesoporous silica films (left) were infiltrated with Ba2+ or Sr2+ (center). Nucleation above 1000 °C of α-quartz crystals at the silicon–silica interface during the devitrification of the amorphous silica generates oriented columnar quartz crystallite growth while preserving the mesostructure in the upper quartz layer (right). 
The evolution of individual quartz crystallite sizes, morphology, and orientation is driven by an oriented competitive growth mechanism that mediates preferential orientation of quartz crystal nuclei and produces a columnar microstructure. During this singular competitive growth process, crystal aggregates with the orientation imposed by the (100)-silicon succeed over those that do not have such orientation (see Fig. 9).

(b) A 3D model of the in-plane epitaxial relationship between the quartz film (in orange) and the silicon substrate (in gray) viewed along the [011] zone axis. (c) XRD θ–2θ scan of an epitaxial quartz film that shows the diffraction pattern in the (100) crystallographic direction. The figure is reproduced with permission from images appearing in ref. 25. 
This particular oriented competitive growth mechanism was coupled together with the flexibility of soft chemistry to master control over different pore domains in quartz thin films. The use of templating agents such as surfactants, PB–PEO diblock copolymers or phase separation allowed for the first preparation of piezoelectric mesoporous and macroporous quartz films via solution chemistry (Fig. 10). Large pores (>25 nm) are then retained upon crystallization but small ones (<25 nm) collapse, leading to dense α-quartz films.25,26 These results suggest that a minimum curvature close to 0.08 nm−1 can be accommodated by the α-quartz crystals, though the wall thickness is also apt to play a role. In Fig. 10 we can see that the original d-spacing does not apply to the crystallized sample and diffusive sintering has occurred. Typically, mesopore structures are lost during the crystallization of silica due to the relatively slow nucleation rate followed by the extremely fast growth rate of quartz,168 which generates crystallites much larger than the original pore structures. Thus prior to this report in 2013,25 the only way to access structured quartz was through the use of physical techniques with limited size domains.169,170

(a, c and e) FEG-SEM images demonstrating the different pore sizes obtained in amorphous silica films: macropores and mesopores with an average pore of (a) ≈700 nm, (c) ≈28 nm and (d) ≈2 nm. (b, d and f) AFM images display the crystallized nanostructured quartz thin films with the different pore sizes. The figure is partially reproduced with permission from images appearing in ref. 25. 
In addition to standard templating techniques, materials scientists can now make use of a new phase separation technique to generate macropores of controllable size between 75 and 2000 nm.26 The films are prepared using dip-coating with the devitrificant salts present in solution (Fig. 11). Although many salts can be used for the phase separation process, so far only Ca2+, Sr2+ and Ba2+ have led to the crystallization of quartz under the concentrations of the melting agent and thermal treatment conditions tested.25,26
 Fig. 11  Scheme of macroporous (700 nm) epitaxial quartz crystallization via phase separation. (a and b) The phase separation mechanism is followed by a swift dewetting process, where ions of strontium or calcium were homogeneously confined within the amorphous silica matrix during gelification and drying of dip coated films. (c) This process enables quartz thin films to maintain the initial template arrangement and pore size as obtained during phase separation at room temperature. The figure is partially reproduced with permission from images appearing in ref. 25 and 26. 
Although many glasses contain the network modifiers used to crystallize SiO2, crystallization in thin films was not previously observed under such mild conditions. We have observed that oddly an excess of devitrificant prevents crystallization. One possible explanation is that at higher concentrations of network modifiers, the ion mobility is decreased.171 Only catalytic quantities lead to epitaxial growth. A deficit of melting agent causes non-oriented crystal growth and large proportions of amorphous material (Fig. 12).

Irrespective of the pore size, the piezoelectric functionality of the quartz films is completely preserved (Fig. 13). We show that the piezo-response force microscopy response (PFM) preserves the features of the topographic image, namely the boundaries between the crystals surrounding the porosity and the perimeter of the pores, with no significant differences between the PFM response in the inner and outer regions of the pore.26 Thus, the authors demonstrated that the combination of soft chemistry and epitaxial growth opens opportunities for the controlled design of textured crystalline solids attractive for further integration of functional oxides on silicon substrates.

In light of this, Carretero-Genevrier et al. used these recent developments of soft chemistry based routes to integrate α-quartz thin films on silicon substrates for the epitaxial growth of single crystalline oxide nanowire films.172 The nucleation and crystalline growth of 1D nanostructures were observed on silicon substrates when Sr2+ or Ba2+ cations were present in the precursor solution. Once again, Sr2+ or Ba2+ cations induced a heterogeneous catalysis that allows the devitrification of the native amorphous surface layer to finally obtain the crystallization of α-quartz crystals at the interface. This polycrystalline α-quartz film provides a convenient interface lattice matching to the complex oxide nanostructures for the epitaxial growth of manganate nanowires (OMS) at 800 °C (Fig. 14).
 Fig. 14  Schematic of the stages of the crystallization process for single crystalline manganate OMS nanowires on silicon. (1) Track-etched nanoporous polymer template supported on a SiO2/Si substrate filled with the chemical precursor solution allowing a homogeneous distribution of Ba2+ or Sr2+ melting agents. (2) At mild temperatures (500–600 °C) confinement nucleation in high aspect ratio nanopores of seed nanowires. (3) Devitrification of the SiO2 layer and nucleation of α-quartz take place at the interface where epitaxial growth of manganate OMS nanowires on the quartz is promoted at high temperatures (800 °C). This figure contains images that are reproduced with permission from ref. 26. 
This innovative methodology involves the use of track-etched nanoporous polymer templates combined with the growth of quartz thin films as described elsewhere.173 Significantly, this confined growth mechanism is extendable to different NW compositions, as long as Ba2+ or Sr2+ are present in the initial nanowire precursor solution as devitrifying agents. Thus, the authors achieved by chemical solution deposition the synthesis of different single crystalline epitaxial nanowire films, including Ba1+δMn8O16 hollandite, Sr1+δMn8O16 strontiomelane, (BaSr)1+δMn8O16 and a novel crystallographic phase named LaSr-2 × 4 OMS on top of (100)-silicon substrates (Fig. 15).172 The LaSr-2 × 4 OMS nanowires display enhanced ferromagnetic properties with a Curie temperature higher than 500 K,174 and Ba1+δMn8O16 hollandite nanowires show a ferromagnetic ordering at low temperatures (∼40 K).

This work marks the importance of a good interplay between chemical compatibility, lattice mismatch, crystallographic structure, interface, and surface energies which is fundamental for nanostructure nucleation and further crystallographic phase stabilization.175
VIII. Outlook and conclusions
In this manuscript, we highlighted the most successful synthetic strategies used currently to fabricate structured nanocrystalline thin films. The majority of research has focused on optimizing synthetic strategies to obtain the best properties from the nanocrystalline films for various applications of high societal impact. After about sixteen years of development, almost any type of simple or complex metal oxide can be obtained as a structured thin film, either by direct crystallization onto a substrate or by post-deposition of crystalline nanoparticles. The main physico-chemical understanding of crystallizing structured systems has been explored in this review, with explanation of the importance of substrate–film interfacial energies, micelle–substrate interactions, and how micelle structure can orient crystal growth due to unit cell alignment with micelles combining with van der Waals interactions. The mesostructuration increases the interfacial energy and thus typically lowers crystallization temperatures. Also considered are the complex and dynamic chemistry of EISA film deposition, the contraction stresses of structured materials during crystallization, and the colloid–micelle interactions when NBBs are used. Crystalline mesoporous metal oxides can be formed with a high degree of control over 2D and 3D architectures. Future research should focus on fully decoupling the crystallinity and pore structure and extending the applications of these films.
Most commonly, crystallization requires pressure and/or heat to convert the amorphous network into a regularly structured framework. These conditions preclude the creation of a hybrid material, eliminating large domains of application. “Crystal like” hybrid materials were reported which relied on H-bonding, hydrophobic–hydrophilic interactions and π–π stacking in order to “crystallize” around an ordered mesoporous structure.176 There is vast potential for hybrid crystalline thin films in applications which rely on conduction, thermal stability, mechanical strength, low density and tunable micro- and mesoframeworks and thus we hope to see vast developments in this area of research.
We have shown the power of coupling the epitaxial relationship of the substrate and the film with soft chemistry.25,26,167 This fusion of physics, chemistry and processing allows structured, oriented crystalline thin films to be produced through chemical solution deposition, via a straightforward, reproducible and commercially applied dip-coating process. Complex materials such as these films can open up new applications for biological sensors and piezoelectric resonators with higher sensitivities than the current state of the art. Moreover, these structured piezoelectric responsive films can be used as substrates to grow antennas displaying a magnetic or an electronic field, opening the doorway to new optical and electronic devices. Further research in the domain should focus on further understanding the crystallization mechanism, measuring the Q-factor of these ultra thin mesoporous resonators, increasing the complexity of quartz architectures and integrating these piezoelectric structured films into devices.
Although some successful industrial applications have been reported, the real societal impact of such thin films is still limited by the lack of practical development of their integration in industrially functional systems. The industrial application constraints typically arise from: (i) the substrate on which the thin film must be deposited. One often meets the substrate chemical and thermal stability, or thermal expansion coefficients incompatible with the thermal treatment needed for the crystallization or the stabilization of the nanocrystalline layer. (ii) The industrial deposition processing must be adapted to both the solution chemistry and the geometry of the substrates. For instance current challenges include high speed deposition onto large flat panels, 3D deposition onto substrates with complex or tortuous geometries, and precisely controlled liquid deposition on small surfaces for integration of microsystems. (iii) The in operando stability of the properties and integrity of the nanocrystalline layers are eventually always critical parameters. As these critical points are scarcely discussed in the literature, the actual prospects of evolution are obviously to accelerate the development of industrially compatible liquid deposition and stabilization processes that can directly impact the economic viability, stability and potential toxicity of the mesoporous nanocrystalline thin films.

 	Fig. 1  Three chemical solution methods to create mesoporous materials. (a) Chemical etching is performed to drill into a metallic film, which is then oxidized to form a mesostructured metal oxide. The SEM (left) and TEM (right) images are from a silicon substrate patterned with Ag, and then etched in dilute hydrofluoric acid to produce mesoporous nanowires. Microscopy images are reproduced with permission from ref. 37. (b) Nanobuilding blocks are aggregated around micelles through EISA before organic matter is removed, often through thermal decomposition. The SEM (left) and TEM (right) images show a Nb doped anatase TiO2 film prepared from pre-crystallized particles assembled with Pluronic F127. Microscopy images are reproduced with permission from ref. 38. (c) Deposition of hydrolyzed molecular precursors, originating from molecules such as Si(OEt)4 and TiCl4, along with a self-assembling surfactant can lead to ordered mesoporosity. In the TEM images ZnTiO3 templated with Pluronic F127 is viewed from the [110] and [001] directions. Microscopy images are reproduced with permission from ref. 39.	 

 	Fig. 2  Preparation followed by thermally induced crystallization of mesoporous thin films from deposition of a film of block copolymers (BCPs) and inorganic precursors/nanobuilding blocks (I). Here a deposition of two layers of micelles is depicted, though anywhere between a monolayer and over a dozen layers can be deposited in a single coating.

 	Fig. 5  (a) Graphical depiction of epitaxial growth of hexagonal silica films on cubic TiO2. Micrographs of hexagonal SiO2 grown above cubic TiO2 with a (b) good and (c) poor lattice match. The figure is reproduced with permission from images appearing in ref. 149.	 

 	Fig. 6  (A) XRD analysis of non-porous and mesoporous crystalline MoO3 films on glass substrates, (a) 25 wt% surfactant, (b) 0.03 wt% surfactant, (c) no surfactant, and (d) JCPDS database pattern 5-508. (B) Illustration of the molybdite unit cell composed of Mo (green) and oxygen (red). The figure is reproduced with permission from images appearing in ref. 153.	 

 	Fig. 7  Scheme of the formation of an oriented polycrystalline α-quartz thin film with epitaxially selected crystallographic orientation from the (100)-silicon substrate, through a one-pot route. (1) Cross-section of the original mesoporous film showing homogeneous Ba2+, Sr2+ or Ca2+ distribution within the amorphous silica matrix. (2) Nucleation above 900 °C of α-quartz crystals at the silicon–silica interface during the devitrification of the amorphous mesoporous film. (3) Oriented columnar quartz crystallite growth within the (100)-silicon substrate, where the crystallization rate and depth are limited by oxygen diffusion. The HRTEM image of the α-quartz-Si interface along [001] exhibits the crystallinity of quartz on silicon. The melting agents (Ba2+, Sr2+ or Ca2+, blue spheres), used to devitrify amorphous silica, migrate from the interior of the film during quartz formation to the crystal boundaries. The figure is reproduced with permission from images appearing in ref. 25.	 

 	Fig. 8  Scheme of the formation of an oriented polycrystalline α-quartz thin film with epitaxially selected crystallographic orientation from the (100)-silicon substrate by infiltration of network modifiers into the mesoporous SiO2. Top-view and cross-sectional SEM images of the amorphous mesoporous silica films (left) were infiltrated with Ba2+ or Sr2+ (center). Nucleation above 1000 °C of α-quartz crystals at the silicon–silica interface during the devitrification of the amorphous silica generates oriented columnar quartz crystallite growth while preserving the mesostructure in the upper quartz layer (right).	 

 	Fig. 9  (a) FEG-SEM micrograph displaying a cross-sectional view of the oriented columnar microstructure in a quartz thin film. (b) A 3D model of the in-plane epitaxial relationship between the quartz film (in orange) and the silicon substrate (in gray) viewed along the [011] zone axis. (c) XRD θ–2θ scan of an epitaxial quartz film that shows the diffraction pattern in the (100) crystallographic direction. The figure is reproduced with permission from images appearing in ref. 25.	 

 	Fig. 10  Schematic of heteroepitaxial growth of α-quartz thin films on Si(100) from silica films deposited using sol–gel chemistry. (a, c and e) FEG-SEM images demonstrating the different pore sizes obtained in amorphous silica films: macropores and mesopores with an average pore of (a) ≈700 nm, (c) ≈28 nm and (d) ≈2 nm. (b, d and f) AFM images display the crystallized nanostructured quartz thin films with the different pore sizes. The figure is partially reproduced with permission from images appearing in ref. 25.	 

 	Fig. 11  Scheme of macroporous (700 nm) epitaxial quartz crystallization via phase separation. (a and b) The phase separation mechanism is followed by a swift dewetting process, where ions of strontium or calcium were homogeneously confined within the amorphous silica matrix during gelification and drying of dip coated films. (c) This process enables quartz thin films to maintain the initial template arrangement and pore size as obtained during phase separation at room temperature. The figure is partially reproduced with permission from images appearing in ref. 25 and 26.	 

 	Fig. 12  Thermal treatment at 1000 °C of macroporous silica films prepared using different contents of Sr2+ relative to 16.3 mmol Si.

FEG-SEM images of (b and c) 2 mmol of Sr2+, (d and e) 1 mmol of Sr2+, (f and g) 0.5 mmol of Sr2+, (h and g) 0.25 mmol of Sr2+ relative to 16.3 mmol Si. The figure is partially reproduced with permission from images appearing in ref. 26.

(c) The amplitude response to different applied tip voltages. This figure is reproduced with permission from ref. 26.	 

 	Fig. 14  Schematic of the stages of the crystallization process for single crystalline manganate OMS nanowires on silicon. (1) Track-etched nanoporous polymer template supported on a SiO2/Si substrate filled with the chemical precursor solution allowing a homogeneous distribution of Ba2+ or Sr2+ melting agents. (2) At mild temperatures (500–600 °C) confinement nucleation in high aspect ratio nanopores of seed nanowires. (3) Devitrification of the SiO2 layer and nucleation of α-quartz take place at the interface where epitaxial growth of manganate OMS nanowires on the quartz is promoted at high temperatures (800 °C). This figure contains images that are reproduced with permission from ref. 26.
