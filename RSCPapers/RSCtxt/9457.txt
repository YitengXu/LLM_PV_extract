    , Accepted 21st January 2011First published on 14th February 2011AbstractIn this paper we report that single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) can protect surface adsorbed Rhodamine B (RhB) molecules from permanent photo-oxidationvia a reversible reaction. Upon strong light irradiation at 514 nm, the SWNT-adsorbed RhB molecules were switched to a non-fluorescent form, which looked like ordinary bleaching behavior. However, after staying without light for several hours the non-fluorescent dye species turned back to the original fluorescent form. This on/off switching can be considered as a reversible photobleaching process of the dye molecules. Other irreversible photochemical pathways of RhB were strongly prohibited due to the presence of SWNTs, providing the dye molecules with a high resistance against permanent photodegradation. By determining the maximum number of reconvertable RhB molecules per unit length of the nanotubes, we have further proved that this effect only works for the first layer of adsorbed dye molecules on the SWNT surfaces.
Introduction

Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are important nanomaterials with many potential applications (e.g. nanoelectronics,1drug delivery,2,3 bioimaging,2,4 and biosensing).5–7 As extremely large and well-organized π-conjugated systems CNTs can bear different types of neutral excited states (excitons) and charged states possessing rich and fundamentally interesting excited state dynamics.8–11 Although CNTs have been extensively explored as optical labels and sensors in living cells by monitoring the signals of near-infrared fluorescence and/or Raman scattering,2,5 infrared photodetectors are often expensive and delicate. It is still more convenient to detect light signals in the visible region by taking advantage of common organic dyes. SWNTs have a large surface area that permits efficient loading of many molecules along a nanotube sidewall.2 It has been shown that organic dyes can be noncovalently bound to the surface of SWNTs due to π–π interaction.1,12–15 This property has been utilized for dispersion16 and chirality-selective separation/detection17 of carbon nanotubes. Such hybrid materials have been applied in solar energy conversion, optical imaging,14 and other areas of opto-electronics.18,19 By tailoring the dye molecules with specific ligands, dye/SWNT composites have also been used as active materials in biosensors.6,7
Fluorescence labels and sensors based on organic dyes often suffer from poor photostability of the dye molecules. A possible way to improve the situation is to add other chemical components (reductants and oxidants) to the system, which can reduce/oxidize the long-lived dye radicals (non-emissive states) and thus bring the intermediates back to their emissive form. This principle has been proved to work nicely for some Rhodamine derivatives in solutions. It allows to control photophysical processes, e.g. fluorescence blinking at the single-molecule level, which is important for super-resolution fluorescence microscopy techniques based on photoswitchable probes.20–22 SWNT can serve as a reductant since it is a good electron acceptor and one nanotube can store many electrons. On the other hand, it can also donate electrons to acceptors and act as an oxidant.17 SWNT mediated long range electron transfer has been realized by incorporating both electron donators and acceptors onto the nanotubes.23 By decorating individual semiconducting SWNTs with titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanoparticles,24 it has been shown that electrons are injected from TiO2 nanoparticles to SWNT under UV irradiation and they return to TiO2 when the UV light is cut off.
In the present work, we managed to use SWNTs as a redox mediator to reversibly switch the organic dye molecules between oxidized and non-oxidized states, and meanwhile prevent the dye from irreversible photodegradation. A conventional organic dye, RhB, was used as a coating reagent to debundle the SWNTs. Although similar composites have been reported by other groups,25–27 very little attention has been paid to the photochemistry of these hybrid materials.
Light irradiation in our case results in electron transfer from the RhB dye molecules to SWNTs. The carbon nanotubes preserve the separated charges from dispatching away (or any other irreversible reactions), and charge recombination occurs with a high efficiency eventually, leading to the recovery of RhB molecules from the non-fluorescent charged state to the emissive neutral state. This effect also allows us to purify the nanohybrids by selectively bleaching off the irrecoverable non-adsorbed dye molecules. Consequently, we demonstrate how to measure the number of dye molecules attached to individual carbon nanotubes using fluorescence intensity analysis.28,29 Our work shows a promising way to design self-repairable fluorescence labels by addition of SWNTs as temporal storage of charges. We believe this effect to be of general interest for studies of both industrial application and fundamental photophysics and photochemistry of hybrid materials.
Experimental

HiPco SWNT (1–2 nm in diameter and ∼10 μm in length) was purchased from Chengdu Organic Chemicals Co. Ltd. (Chinese Academy of Sciences, China). The SWNTs were thoroughly treated by piranha solution to remove possible impurities. Spectral grade RhB (with Cl− as counterpart ion) and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Typically, RhB/SWNT or SDS/SWNT nanohybrids were prepared by ultrasonic dispersing of SWNTs (0.2 mg) in an aqueous RhB solution (10 ml, 3 × 10−7 mol L−1) or a SDS solution (10 ml, 0.1 mol L−1), respectively. The solutions were further diluted and then spin cast on clean microscope cover slips. The concentration was tuned in such a way that the average distance between individual RhB/SWNTs (Fig. 1, inset) in the resulted sample was of the order of tens of micrometres. To measure fluorescence of single RhB molecules on SWNT surfaces, we mixed the nanotubes with an extremely diluted RhB solution (6.0 × 10−10 mol L−1) to make sure that the dye molecules are well-separated in the spin-cast sample. Unless specifically noted, all samples were kept in a nitrogen atmosphere during the measurements.

The samples were studied by a home-built wide-field fluorescence microscope described in detail elsewhere.30 The images and fluorescence intensity traces of samples were obtained by using Ar-ion CW laser (514 nm) as the excitation source. The light from the sample was collected by an Olympus 60× N.A. 1.25 oil immersion objective lens and detected by a Cascade 512B EMG CCD camera. For time-resolved fluorescence measurements, a 150 fs pulsed laser at 458 nm was used for excitation (second harmonic of Ti:sapphire laser, Tsunami, 80 MHz repetition rate, with a spectral maximum at 916 nm). The fluorescence photons from the sample were collected by the objective lens and passed through a 100 μm pinhole and then detected by a fast avalanche photodiode (APD, Micro Photo Devices, crystal size 100 μm, 250 cps dark counts) under the control of a time-correlated single-photon counting unit (PicoHarp 300, PicoQuant GmbH). The instrument response function has a width of ∼40 ps.
Results and discussion

Fluorescence microscopy image of a sample prepared by the above-mentioned protocol showed individual RhB/SWNT nanohybrids (Fig. 1). Comparing the spectrum of RhB/SWNT to that of RhB film, one can see that the detected light from RhB/SWNT was mainly the fluorescence of RhB. It has been reported that the intrinsic luminescence of SWNTs lies in the infrared region (λ > 900 nm)9 and, therefore, it gives a negligible signal on our detector. Some weak scattering signal from pristine SWNTs, in contrast, is detectable and overlaps with the emission spectrum of RhB. The contribution of the scattering light was subtracted during the fluorescence intensity analysis described below. Note that the fluorescence band of RhB/SWNT was broader than that of the RhB film, which is due to the inhomogeneity induced by π–π interaction between RhB molecules and SWNT.1,12,13 Such interaction also led to a spectral shift of RhB absorption spectra upon attaching to SWNT (Fig. S1, ESI†).
To investigate the interaction of surface RhB and SWNT, the fluorescence decay dynamics of RhB/SWNT and RhB films were compared (Fig. 2). The fluorescence decay of the RhB film showed a mono-exponential decay with a lifetime of 2.8 ns, while that of RhB/SWNT showed a non-exponential decay dynamics with shorter lifetime components, implying fluorescence quenching of RhB by SWNT. The non-exponential decay behavior may result from the diversity of the quenching efficiencies for different RhB molecules. Assuming that the natural radiative lifetime of RhB remains the same after the molecules are attached to SWNT surfaces, we can estimate the relative fluorescence quantum yield of RhB/SWNT in comparison to the RhB film (ΦRhB−SWNT/ΦRhB film) by comparing the integrated areas under the normalized decay curves (Fig. 2B, inset).31 It turns out that ΦRhB−SWNT/ΦRhB film was about 0.2. It is in consistence with the results obtained for the dye and SWNT in solutions (see ESI†).
 Fig. 2  Typical fluorescence decay profile of a RhB film (A) and that of an individual RhB/SWNT nanohybrid (B) before (a) and after (b) 514 nm laser bleaching (400 W cm−2). Instrument response function (IRF) is also shown in (A). The inset shows the normalized decay profiles in linear scale for the RhB film (1) and the RhB/SWNT (2), respectively. The integrated area under the curve 1 is about 5 times as large as that under the curve 2. 
The RhB fluorescence intensity of a given RhB/SWNT hybrid decreased exponentially and became very small after several minutes of continuous irradiation by 514 nm laser at a power density of ∼400 W cm−2 (Fig. 3A). At the first glance, this behavior looks just like a typical photobleaching process of organic dyes. However, it turned out that the fluorescence of RhB in RhB/SWNT hybrids was able to recover after keeping the sample under darkness for a certain time (typically the full recovery takes several hours, see Fig. 3B), while such fluorescence recovery was hardly observed (<10%) for RhB molecules without SWNT (RhB film). This fact suggests that the RhB molecules on SWNT were temporarily switched to a long-lived non-fluorescent form rather than permanently bleached upon light irradiation. It was possible to repeat the bleaching/recovery cycle many times without attenuation of the maximally recovered fluorescence intensity. Note that although the maximum fluorescence intensities after every recovery cycle were almost the same, they all were a bit smaller than the very initial fluorescence intensity of the nanohybrid before any bleaching ever occurred. This is because non-adsorbed dye molecules were giving fluorescence at the beginning too, while they got permanently bleached in the first cycle and did not contribute to fluorescence in the following cycles. It is important to note that the decrease of fluorescence intensity of RhB/SWNT upon intensive light irradiation was not accompanied with an apparent change in fluorescence lifetime (Fig. 2B). It means that the bleaching is just decreasing of the number of emissive RhB molecules and their fluorescence decay is not influenced anyhow by the bleached dyes.
 Fig. 3  The fluorescence photobleaching (A) (514 nm, 400 W cm−2) and recovery (B) transients of an individual RhB/SWNT (solid line and solid symbols) and the RhB film without SWNT (dashed line and open symbols). The solid line in (B) is the calculation according to eqn (3) with k2 = 9.7 × 10−5 s−1 (lifetime 170 min) for RhB/SWNT. For the recovery (graph B) the samples were kept in darkness. To acquire the fluorescence intensity at a certain time, an exposure of only 100 ms was used. 
The recovery of the fluorescence indicates that the non-fluorescent form of RhB in RhB/SWNT can spontaneously return to the original fluorescent form. The lifetime of the non-fluorescent form can be determined by monitoring the fluorescence recovery dynamics.
We used a simple reaction scheme to describe the reversible process between the fluorescent form (F) and non-fluorescent (dark) form (D) of RhB molecules in the nanohybrids. It can be denoted as: (1a) (1b)where k1 and k2 are the rate constants of the bleaching and recovery processes, respectively. The reciprocal of k2 represents the lifetime of D, the non-fluorescent form.
In principle one can derive k2 from the full fluorescence intensity transient as shown in Fig. 3B. However, the full bleaching/recovery cycle often takes many hours and it is time consuming to measure enough number of individual nanohybrids to make a distribution histogram of k2. We therefore adopt an alternative approach. As shown in Fig. 4, the fluorescence intensity time traces were recorded for individual RhB/SWNT hybrids under interrupted laser excitation with variable laser “on” and “off” periods. In each cycle, neither the bleaching nor the recovery was fully accomplished. The recovery efficiency is characterized by a parameter, recovery coefficient (R), which is related to the fluorescence intensity and defined as: R = (I2 – I1)/(I0 – I1)(2)where I0: the maximum fluorescence intensity before bleaching, I1: the fluorescence intensity just before switching the laser off, and I2: the fluorescence intensity right upon switching the laser on again (see Fig. 4).
 Fig. 4  Schematic illustration of a fluorescence intensity time trace of RhB/SWNT (bottom) under an interrupted laser illumination (top). I0: initial value of the fluorescence intensity; I1 and I2 are the fluorescence intensities just before and after the sample was kept without laser excitation during time tdark. See the text and the ESI† for the calculation of the recovery coefficient R. 
It can be shown that for reaction (1a) and (1b), R can be expressed as (see ESI† for details): R = 1 − exp(−k2tdark)(3)
or ln(1 − R) = −k2tdark(4)where tdark is the time the object stays in dark (Fig. 4). It is convenient that R does not depend on the pre-history of the light exposure but depends only on the last time period the object was kept without light. We have checked for several nanohybrids that the k2 values obtained by this way are indeed the same as those obtained from the entire fluorescence recovery time traces like the one shown in Fig. 3B.

Fig. 5 plots ln(1 − R) which is proportional to the concentration of dye in the dark state as a function of tdark for four individual RhB/SWNT hybrids. We note that some of the data points cannot be fitted by the linear law because the non-fluorescent states may possess more than one lifetime components even for the RhB molecules on the same nanotube. This fact is easy to understand since the surface of a nanotube is often imperfect8 and the orientation and the distance to the nanotube surface can vary from one RhB molecule to another. Nevertheless, the fitting results provide an approximation for the lifetime of the non-fluorescent form (Fig. 5, inset). One can see that k2 lies in a range of 4–12 × 10−5 s−1 (6.9 × 10−5 s−1 on average), corresponding to the non-fluorescent state lifetime of 140–400 min (240 min on average).

Inset: distribution of k2 for 18 individual RhB/SWNT nanohybrids. 

Fig. 6 schematically illustrates the photophysical processes occurred during the bleaching/recovery cycle of RhB/SWNT in comparison to the irreversible bleaching processes32–35 of pristine RhB films. A dark state (non-fluorescent form, D) is involved in both cases. In the case of pristine RhB film, the formation of the dark state and its returning to the ground state are strongly competed by other irreversible photochemical processes, leading to permanent photodegradation (formation of irreversible products, P, Fig. 6A). In the case of the RhB/SWNT hybrid, the irreversible bleaching processes are significantly suppressed by the presence of SWNT, i.e. the pathway to product P is prohibited (possible reasons will be discussed below). The decay rate (k2) of the dark state is very small and independent of excitation power density, while its population rate (k1) depends on the excitation power and the quantum efficiency of the S1 → D transition process. Although this efficiency is expected to be low, k1 can be much larger than k2 at high excitation power. In this case, all the adsorbed dye molecules will be eventually converted to their dark states under continuous irradiation due to the so-called “bottle-neck” effect.32,33 The transition to the CT state shown in the scheme corresponds to the singlet state quenching process observed as shortening of the fluorescence decay time of RhB in the hybrids (Fig. 2B).

One can see some analogy between the bleaching/recovery effect and fluorescence blinking of single molecules and particles. Indeed, blinking of single organic dye molecules,32,33,36conjugated polymers37–39 and quantum dots40 is caused by reversible photogeneration of long-lived dark states. However, the recovery times (duration of the “off” periods) for those systems are ranged from tens of milliseconds to seconds, 4–6 orders of magnitude shorter than the lifetime of the non-fluorescent form we report here. Moreover, the reversible blinking is usually accompanied by an irreversible degradation mechanism leading to permanent fluorescence bleaching,32 which is not the case in our system.
It is a challenge to unravel the nature of the extremely long-lived dark states formed in RhB/SWNT hybrids. We suggest that the photo-excitation of RhB (S0 → S1) is the primary step for the dark state generation (Fig. 6), and this excited state has to be thermally unfavorable in comparison to the ground state (S0) so that it can spontaneously relax back to the S0 state. Here we present several possible origins for this non-emissive state: (1) a long-lived charge separated state formed by RhB and SWNT; (2) a photogenerated complex of RhB with oxygen (or other impurities in the sample) which can dissociate under darkness with the aid of SWNT; (3) a twisted/bended structure of RhB, resulted from photoinduced deconformation/isomerization and stabilized by the SWNT surface.
It has been reported that Rhodamine derivatives readily form radicals on glass via charge transfer to the substrate.32,33 SWNT function as a charge acceptor in similar organic dye modified hybrids1,12,13 and the ability of SWNT to accumulate charges18,41 have been well recognized in the literature. The redox potential of RhB has been reported to be 1.18 V vs.NHE42 while that of SWNT is 0.8 V vs.NHE,43 which makes photoinduced charge transfer from the dye to the SWNT feasible. Therefore it is natural to attribute the bleaching and recovery processes to the forth and back charge transfer reactions between RhB molecules and the SWNT which is the first origin mentioned above. This assumption is further supported by comparing completely different blinking behaviors of single RhB molecules anchored to SWNTs or spin-cast on a bare glass substrate (Fig. S3, ESI†). Blinking with extremely long “off” times was observed for RhB molecules attached to SWNTs contrary to fast irreversible bleaching for RhB adsorbed on glass. This indicates that a reversible reaction is responsible for the photogeneration of the dark state of RhBs on SWNTs while irreversible processes dominate when RhBs are “sitting” on a bare glass.
The very long lifetime (up to several hours) of the charge-separated state of RhB/SWNT suggests a very low charge-recombination rate. One possible reason for the slow recombination is deep trapping of charges in SWNT.12,18,44 Indeed, the oxidized intermediates of SWNT17,45 and the charged SWNT46 have been reported to be stable in solution or in solid state for days. Another reason of much slower back reaction in comparison with the forward one is the charge transportation in SWNT.18,23,47 When an electron is injected into the SWNT it might travel away from the donor site until it gets trapped. Therefore, in order to neutralize the positively charged dye molecule, a trapped electron has to leave the trapping site and travel along SWNT again to the closest vicinity of the dye. Furthermore, the back charge transfer reaction should be very dependent on particular organization of the dye molecules and electronic properties of the particular SWNT, resulting in its individuality for different RhB/SWNT hybrids as confirmed experimentally (Fig. 5). However, a bare glass substrate cannot accumulate charges. The separated electrons and holes tend to dissipate and annihilate (with oxygen, substrate defects or impurities),32,33 leading to a very low recombination efficiency and thus irreversible bleaching.
Meanwhile the positive charges (holes) appearing as radical cations are also stabilized via delocalization over SWNT surface atoms. While electrons possess a high mobility along the nanotube, holes are more immobilized on the RhB moieties and can stay “alive” for a long time. Even though the charge-recombination rate is low, the ultimate recombination efficiency can be very high (given enough time in darkness) because of lacking of competing processes. Another reason for the high stability of the SWNT-adsorbed RhB molecules against permanent oxidation lies in the fact that SWNT can act as an efficient oxygen scavenger.48,49 As a result, the long-lived transient species of RhB such as triplet states and radical cations react much less with oxygen when they are in the vicinity of SWNT surfaces. In such case, SWNT acts as both a multiple-electron acceptor and an antioxidant. The RhB components in the nanohybrids may be protected just because the nanotubes are more reactive to oxygen than the dye molecules. Note that we only concern on the reversibility of the RhB molecules between radical cations and neutral ground states, and we cannot exclude a possibility that some irreversible changes occurred to the nanotubes.
Not all the dye molecules in the mixture of RhB and SWNT could be effectively protected, especially when the feeding ratio of RhB was too high. To characterize the maximum protecting capability of each individual nanotube, an excessive amount of RhB was used to prepare the sample. The sample was irradiated by the laser until all the dye molecules were bleached. Then it was kept in darkness sufficiently long for the fluorescence recovery to occur. This bleaching/recovery procedure was repeated several times until the maximally recovered fluorescence intensity hardly attenuates any more. After the bleaching/recovery cycles, the free dye molecules were irreversibly photobleached, while the molecules attached to the SWNT surfaces were able to recover, yielding high-contrast fluorescence images of individual nanohybrids. The number of protected RhB molecules per unit length of nanotubes was then estimated using the method described below.
The number of RhB molecules on each nanotube (NRhB) was determined by comparing the maximum fluorescence brightness (fluorescence intensity/excitation power density) of the RhB/SWNT nanohybrid (B0) with the brightness of a single RhB molecule (Bsingle) attached to SWNT, as shown below (see ESI† for details): NRhB = B0/Bsingle(5)
All the fluorescence intensities were obtained under the same experimental conditions.

Eqn (5) is based on a simple idea that the total fluorescence intensity of an ensemble of molecules is the sum of the fluorescence intensities of all individual molecules in the ensemble. The same method has been proved to work very well for individual J-aggregates28 and conjugated polymer chains.29
To measure Bsingle, a very low concentration of RhB was mixed with SWNT so that the dye molecules in the spin-cast sample could be individually measured. All the RhB molecules are expected to be adsorbed on the SWNT surfaces in this case. Many single RhB molecules were measured and the average fluorescence brightness was calculated and used as Bsingle (averaging over 530 molecules gave Bsingle = 9 collected photons s−1W−1 cm2).
Generally speaking the maximum number of RhB molecules protected by a nanotube is limited by its capacity to store electrons and its surface area to accommodate dye molecules. Both these factors are expected to be proportional to the length of the nanotube for a given tube with its characteristic diameter and chirality. Since the length (l) of each nanotube can be directly determined from the fluorescence image, we further calculated the surface density of RhB molecules on the nanotube, dRhB, i.e. the number of RhB molecules protected per unit length of the nanotube: dRhB = NRhB/l(6)

Fig. 7 shows the distribution histogram of dRhB for 89 individual nanohybrids calculated by eqn (6). It turned out that the protecting ability of unit length of a nanotube is inhomogeneous for different nanotubes. This individuality may arise from the diversity in their inherent properties (e.g. diameter, conductivity, chirality, and density of defects) and the diversity in the arrangement of the dye molecules on the surfaces. It can be seen that the maximum number of recoverable RhB molecules per nanometre of SWNT is usually below 1 (∼70%) and never exceeds 3 (the average value is 0.7). Taking into account the diameter (1–2 nm) of the nanotubes, this result suggests that the surface density of the recoverable RhB molecules is always below 1 nm−2. Considering the size of the RhB molecule (∼1.5 nm2),50 we can claim that the self-reparation effect only works for the first layer of RhB molecules attached on the nanotube surface. Therefore, the protection capacity of a nanotube is mainly limited by its ability to accommodate dye molecules on its surface.

Conclusion
We have observed spontaneous recovery of the fluorescence intensity of SWNT-adsorbed RhB molecules after photobleaching. The reversible bleaching/recovery processes were attributed to forward and back charge transfer reactions between the dye and SWNT. Therefore SWNTs can be used as protectors for surface bound dye molecules against permanent photo-oxidation. Full recovery of fluorescence intensity typically took several hours due to the trapping and delocalization of injected charges in SWNT. We found that the protection effect only works for the first layer of RhBs attached to the SWNT surface. The observed recovery effect can be regarded as self-reparation of the dye molecules.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  Normalized spectrum of an individual RhB/SWNT (solid line), emission spectrum of a RhB film in the absence of SWNT (dashed line), and scattering spectrum of a SDS/SWNT (dotted line). Inset: a typical fluorescence image of RhB/SWNT nanohybrid.	 

 	Fig. 2  Typical fluorescence decay profile of a RhB film (A) and that of an individual RhB/SWNT nanohybrid (B) before (a) and after (b) 514 nm laser bleaching (400 W cm−2). Instrument response function (IRF) is also shown in (A). The inset shows the normalized decay profiles in linear scale for the RhB film (1) and the RhB/SWNT (2), respectively. The integrated area under the curve 1 is about 5 times as large as that under the curve 2.	 

 	Fig. 3  The fluorescence photobleaching (A) (514 nm, 400 W cm−2) and recovery (B) transients of an individual RhB/SWNT (solid line and solid symbols) and the RhB film without SWNT (dashed line and open symbols). The solid line in (B) is the calculation according to eqn (3) with k2 = 9.7 × 10−5 s−1 (lifetime 170 min) for RhB/SWNT. For the recovery (graph B) the samples were kept in darkness. To acquire the fluorescence intensity at a certain time, an exposure of only 100 ms was used.

	(1b)
R = (I2 – I1)/(I0 – I1)	(2)

 	Fig. 4  Schematic illustration of a fluorescence intensity time trace of RhB/SWNT (bottom) under an interrupted laser illumination (top). I0: initial value of the fluorescence intensity; I1 and I2 are the fluorescence intensities just before and after the sample was kept without laser excitation during time tdark. See the text and the ESI† for the calculation of the recovery coefficient R.	 
R = 1 − exp(−k2tdark)	(3)
ln(1 − R) = −k2tdark	(4)

 	Fig. 5  Decay kinetics of the dark state. The plots of ln(1 − R) (symbols) for four individual RhB/SWNT hybrids as a function of the time that the samples were kept in darkness (tdark). Lines are the fitted curves according to eqn (4). The fitting parameters (k2) are 7.6 × 10−5 s−1; 4.2 × 10−5 s−1; 6.4 × 10−5 s−1; 8.6 × 10−5 s−1, respectively. Inset: distribution of k2 for 18 individual RhB/SWNT nanohybrids.	 

 	Fig. 6  Energy level diagrams to illustrate the photophysical processes in RhB films (A) and RhB/SWNT nanohybrids (B) where S0: ground state; S1: singlet excited state; Fl: fluorescence; nr: non-irradiative deactivation; CT: fast charge separation and recombination process; D: dark state (non-fluorescent form); P: irreversible products.	 
NRhB = B0/Bsingle	(5)
dRhB = NRhB/l	(6)

 	Fig. 7  Distribution histogram of the number of RhB molecules per 1 nm SWNT length protected against photo-oxidation.
