    , Accepted 25th May 2022First published on 26th May 2022AbstractThe development of tin (Sn)-based perovskite solar cells has attracted extensive attention due to their strong infrared absorption and non-toxicity properties. However, the self-doping effect of Sn2+ oxidation leads to the generation of abundant vacancies of Sn, and the excessively fast crystallization rate also produces serious pinholes in the film. This hinders the further development of Sn-based perovskite devices. In this study, hydrazine monohydrochloride (HMCl) and diethylamine hydrochloride (DEACl) were simultaneously introduced into the precursor solution to suppress the oxidation of Sn2+ and decelerate the crystallization rate of the film, and thus, a high-quality quasi-2D DEA2FAn−1SnnI3n+1 film was obtained (FA: formamidinium). Additionally, DEA+ is confirmed as more beneficial for carrier transfer than BA+ and PEA+via density functional theory calculations and experimental evidence in the quasi-2D perovskite films. Consequently, under the synergistic effect of two hydrochlorides, a champion power conversion efficiency of 9.5% with ultra-high stability was realized due to a significant increase in VOC. This study demonstrated a new strategy to evidently enhance the performance and stability of Sn-based perovskite devices by causing the 3D to 2D structure transition via two functional additives.
Introduction
Organic–inorganic hybrid halide perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) attracted significant attention due to their excellent photoelectric properties such as high carrier mobility, high absorption coefficient, and low exciton binding energy.1–5 During the past decade, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of solar cells based on the lead perovskites has rapidly increased from 3.8% to more than 25%.6,7 However, it has been generally considered that two evident disadvantages exist, which can limit the commercial application of lead-based perovskites in the future. One of the disadvantages corresponds to stability, i.e., the perovskite material can decompose in a short time,8–10 especially in a humid environment. The other disadvantage involves the toxicity of lead, which is unfriendly to the environment and health.11–13
To enhance the stability of lead-based perovskites, several methods have been applied, such as solvent engineering,14,15 interface engineering,16–18 and additive engineering.19–21 Among these methods, the most widely used method during recent years involves introducing new additives into perovskites to form an interlayer or 2D structured perovskites. Li et al. reported a fullerene derivative (PCBB-S-N) to modify the electron transport layer (ETL, PCBM), resulting in a significantly improved PCE and stability of the device under moisture and high temperature conditions.18 Huang et al. introduced a molten salt spacer, n-butylamine acetate (BAAc), to form phase-pure quantum wells with a single well width, which significantly improved the stability of the devices.21 Regarding the toxicity of lead, researchers developed certain lead-free perovskite materials by altering Pb2+ with other metal elements such as Sn2+,22,23 Cu2+,24,25 Sb3+,26,27 and Bi3+.28,29 In the lead-free perovskite materials mentioned above, FASnI3 exhibited the best device performance due to its wide light harvesting range close to the infrared region (IR), low exciton binding energy, and high carrier mobility.5,30,31 However, when compared with lead perovskite, tin (Sn)-based perovskite devices exhibit a relatively much lower PCE of only approximately 15%.32–35 It is widely known that the lower PCE is related to the oxidation of Sn2+ under ambient conditions. Partial oxidation (Sn2+ to Sn4+) leads to high p-type self-doping, and the resultant Sn vacancies act as the recombination center, which significantly decreases the performance and stability of the Sn-based perovskite devices.36 Additionally, the highly uncontrollable crystallization process of tin-based perovskite affects the overall performance and repeatability of the devices.37,38
To improve the PCE and stability of the Sn-based perovskite devices, certain methods are applied to suppress the oxidation of Sn2+ and control the crystallization rate of Sn-based perovskite active layers.39–44 To date, tin fluoride (SnF2) is one of the most commonly used reagents for this type of application. For example, Mathews et al. reported that they use SnF2 as a reducing agent in a n–i–p device structure and realized a PCE of 2%.39 Kanatzidis et al. reported that the formation of SnI2·3DMSO intermediates is beneficial in improving the morphology of the Sn-based perovskite film.40 Recently, Seok et al. used a SnF2–pyrazine complex as an additive to mitigate the phase separation by inducing excessive SnF2.41 Meanwhile, many other components were also used as additives to suppress the oxidation of Sn2+ in Sn-based perovskites. Bian et al. reported significant improvement in the device performance by adding Sn powder into the FASnI3 precursor solution.43 Chen et al. introduced a polymer (PTN-Br) as a Lewis adduct to passivate the trap states in the perovskite film, and consequently the solar cells exhibited an evident enhancement in open-circuit voltage (VOC) and PCEs.44 Recently, Hayase et al. suppressed the trap density by as much as one order of magnitude by partially replacing formamidinium cations (FA+) with ethylammonium cations (EA+), and a PCE of 13.27% for the Sn-based PVSC was presented.33 Liu and coworkers incorporated an efficient reductant phenylhydrazine cation (PhNHNH3+) into the FASnI3 perovskite film to passivate the trap state and successfully realized a PCE of 13.4%.32 Some other hydrazine species including hydrazine dihydrochloride, hydrazine monohydrobromide and hydrazine iodide have also been used in tin-based perovskites and achieved certain effects, indicating that hydrazine can optimize tin-based perovskite materials to a certain extent.45–47
Based on the successful experience of lead-based performance improvement, a low-dimensional perovskite, which was formed by replacing the small hydrophilic cations (MA+ and FA+) with large organic cations (butylammonium, phenylethylammonium, etc.) can efficiently improve the stability of solar cells.48,49 There has been significant progress in research on low-dimensional lead PVSCs, and thus, the PCE has exceeded 18%.50 However, there is a paucity of studies on Sn-based low-dimensional PVSCs, and their PCE is still very low. In 2017, Ning et al. reported a Sn-based perovskite with a 2D structure, in which phenylethylammonium (PEA) was doped into the FASnI3 precursor solution to form 2D PEA2FA8Sn9I28 (n = 9) perovskite with a PCE of 5.9%.48 Kanatzidis et al. introduced butylammonium (BA+) as a large organic cation and used triethylphosphine as an efficient antioxidant in FASnI3 to form the BA2FA3Sn4I13 (n = 4) perovskite material and obtained a 2D Sn-based PVSC with a PCE of 2.5%.49 Loi and Ning et al. introduced PEAI into FASnI3via different methods to form a special two-dimensional tin-based perovskite structure, and finally obtained devices with PCEs exceeding 9%.51,52 Recently, Yuan et al. reported highly vertically oriented tin-based quasi-2D perovskite films by using 5-ammoniumvaleric acid (5-AVA+) as the organic spacer and ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) as an additive, and thereby, obtained a device with enhanced efficiency and stability.53 Liu et al. employed different alkylamines (butylamine, octylamine, and dodecylamine) as spacer cations to investigate the impacts of the chain length on the crystal orientation and phase distribution of 2D Sn-based perovskite films. They proved that the shorter chain spacer cations are beneficial to the vertical growth of the film, and the spacer cations suppress the oxidation of Sn2+ and ultimately improve the performance of the devices.54 Zhang et al. increased the grain size of tin-based perovskites and obtained better energy level matching by introducing a large cation diethylamine (DEA+, from DEAI), which indicated that DEA+ could also optimize tin-based perovskites to a certain extent.55
Hydrazine monohydrochloride (HMCl, N2H5Cl) exhibits a strong reducing power to inhibit the oxidation of Sn2+, and this can efficiently decrease Sn vacancies in the film. When compared to previously reported PEA+, BA+, and AVA+, diethylamine (DEA+) exhibits a lower steric hindrance. Hence, it can aid in carrier transport in 2D perovskites, which have been intensively examined and proven via density functional theory (DFT) and experimental results (vide infra). Additionally, chloride ions can appropriately adjust the perovskite band gap and enlarge the grain size to promote device performance.56 Compared with other hydrazine species, HMCl has a smaller steric hindrance and is easy to disperse into perovskite films to inhibit the oxidation of Sn2+. Therefore, in this study, we introduce two hydrochlorides (HMCl and DEACl) to prepare a high-performance quasi-2D Sn-based perovskite film. After the addition of 20% HMCl and 20% DEACl, the perovskite film exhibited the best morphology and highest device performance. Benefiting from the synergistic effects of these two additives, the trap state in the film was significantly decreased and trap-induced non-radiative recombination was also greatly reduced in the quasi-2D DEA2FA8Sn9I28−xClx perovskite film. Moreover, the hole mobility was significantly improved and contributed to the improvement of the performance with a PCE of 9.47%. The updated development and current status of 2D Sn-based perovskites are listed in Table S1.† In the previous study, researchers introduced large cations, such as BA+ or PEA+, to form a 2D or 2D–3D hybrid structure. But in this work, a new type of large cation DEA+ and reducing substance HMCl are introduced. Furthermore, under the synergistic effect of these two substances, the performance of the device is improved significantly. Specifically, the reducing power of HMCl and hydrophobicity of DEACl decreases the connection between tin-based perovskite and water and oxygen, which is very beneficial to the stability of perovskite materials and devices. Consequently, the device stability has also been significantly improved in air and a N2-filled glove box. The detailed results of the study, discussion, and mechanism investigation are presented below.
Results and discussion
The Sn-based perovskite film is prepared via a one-step spin-coating method with dripping anti-solvent, and the detailed process is shown in Fig. S1a† and the “Experimental section”. The control precursor solution is obtained by dissolving FAI, SnI2 and SnF2 (mole ratio: 1:1:0.1) in a mixed solvent of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) with a volume ratio of 4:1. Generally, in Sn-based perovskite films, oxidation of Sn2+ would introduce many Sn vacancies and result in some defects, which is the main reason for low film performance. The oxidation process is as follows: 2FASnI3 + O2 → FA2Sn□I6 + SnO2(1)where “□” denotes a Sn vacancy.37,57
To suppress the oxidation of Sn2+, it is important to enhance the stability of Sn-perovskite precursor solution in oxygen. Thus, DEACl and HMCl were added into the precursor solution to construct a quasi-2D perovskite structure and introduce an additive with strong reducing power. Fig. S2† shows detailed changes in precursor solutions with different additives under the same condition for different time periods. When exposed to air for 30 min, all the solutions change to red at the upper surface, thereby indicating that some Sn2+ is oxidized to Sn4+.58 After 1 h, the control solution (sample 1 in Fig. S2†) changes to completely red at the bottom while the solutions with additives almost exhibit no change at the bottom. When the solution with DEACl or HMCl changes to completely red at the bottom after 3 h, the solution with DEACl and HMCl is still yellow in color. The aforementioned results indicate that the stability of the solution significantly increased when DEACl and HMCl coexist in Sn-perovskite solution. The changes in ionic composition of the precursor solution with different additives exposed to air corresponding to the color change are shown in Fig. 1a–d. The control precursor solution without additives turns red immediately on exposure to air for 3 h (Fig. 1a), while the solution with HMCl does not change within the same time (Fig. 1b). The result indicates that HMCl can inhibit the oxidation of Sn2+ in an oxygen-containing environment because N2H5+ reacts with oxygen before Sn2+ as shown in Fig. 1b.59 Conversely, as shown in Fig. 1a, the red solution turns yellow again after adding HMCl for 1 min, thereby indicating that HMCl can effectively reduce Sn4+ to Sn2+ in the solution. Similarly, the oxidation of Sn2+ in the solution with DEACl is also alleviated as shown in Fig. 1c, which is related to the effective decrease in contact between Sn2+ and oxygen. The color of the oxidized solution does not return after the addition of DEACl, thereby indicating that DEA+ does not possess the ability to reduce Sn4+ (Fig. S3†). As expected, when HMCl and DEACl are simultaneously added to the solution, the color change in the precursor solution is the slowest. This shows that under the synergistic effect of HMCl and DEACl, the solution exhibits a stronger antioxidant capacity. Fig. S4† shows the detailed color change in FASnI3 solution after adding HMCl, where HMCl promotes the reduction in Sn4+ as follows (the reaction schematic is shown in Fig. 1a): 2N2H5Cl → 2NH4Cl + N2 + 2H+ + 2e−(2) Sn4+ + 2e− → Sn2+(3)

Eqn (2) shows that HMCl can release electrons when dissolved in the solution. The electrons reduce Sn4+, and thereby, decrease Sn vacancies. After HMCl reduces Sn4+, the product only corresponds to NH4Cl (as shown in eqn (2)),60,61 which is proven as beneficial to film crystallization with high orientation based on previous studies.53
The additives exhibit the ability to improve the stability of precursor solutions, decrease the adverse effects of oxygen on Sn-based perovskite films, and enhance the film qualities in the crystallization process. Fig. 1e–g show schematics of the crystallization process from different solutions to films. The control solution crystallized much faster to form lots of pinholes, thereby resulting in poor morphology (Fig. 1e). In the presence of trace oxygen (even in a glove box), the FASnI3 film is prone to form Sn vacancies. When Sn2+ is oxidized to Sn4+, the crystal structure transforms into the one (Fig. S5†) wherein half the Sn atoms are removed from the original [SnI6]2− octahedra. The reaction process is provided in eqn (1). Furthermore, SnO2 forms an amorphous state that cannot be detected via XRD.37 In the film-forming process, the grains exhibit random crystallization orientation and many dangling bonds, which can introduce many reaction sites with oxygen. Hence, the solution without additives can be easily oxidized in air as shown in Fig. 1a. When HMCl is added to the solution, the crystallization process is significantly affected. Given the presence of N2H5+, it is difficult for oxygen to oxidize Sn2+. This can reduce the generation of Sn vacancies. As shown in Fig. 1f, when oxygen intrudes into the solution or growing grains, N2H5+ preferentially consumes them as shown in Fig. 1b. Additionally, the existence of HMCl molecules at the grain boundaries can segregate the perovskite and oxygen. Simultaneously, HMCl can decelerate the crystallization rate to improve film quality.59 Thus, HMCl can effectively inhibit the oxidization of Sn2+. The XPS spectra suggest that when HMCl is added, the peak intensity of Sn2+ significantly increases while the peak intensity of Sn4+ significantly decreases, thereby indicating that HMCl significantly suppresses the oxidation of Sn2+ in the film (Fig. S6a and b†). When HMCl and DEACl are simultaneously added, the crystallization process of the solution is improved under the synergistic effect of the two hydrochlorides. When HMCl was added, N2H5+ can only exist at the grain boundaries. However, during the simultaneous addition of HMCl and DEACl, N2H5+ can also exist between the inner layers of the 2D crystal (Fig. 1g). This in turn increases the efficiency of the film's oxidation resistance (obtained from the follow-up SEM and GIWAXS images). Fig. S6c† shows the XPS spectra of the film containing HMCl and DEACl. When compared with Fig. S6a and b,† the peak intensity of Sn4+ in Fig. S6c† is lower, and thus the synergistic effect of HMCl and DEACl can further inhibit the oxidation of Sn2+. Furthermore, DEA+ provides a larger crystal nucleus to promote the grain size of the crystal and the quality of the film. The addition of HMCl and DEACl suppresses the oxidation of Sn2+ and improves film quality (film image is shown to the right of Fig. 1g). Our previous study indicated that DEACl significantly increases crystallization orientation as shown in Fig. 1g.62 Hence, we expect that the joint use of the two hydrochlorides, HMCl and DEACl, are extremely ideal additives in Sn-based perovskite optoelectronic devices.
To explore the effects of HMCl on Sn-based perovskite films, we compared the morphology and crystallization of perovskite films with different HMCl concentrations via scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The results suggest that the control film without HMCl exhibits more pinholes (Fig. S7a†) and displays the worst crystallinity (Fig. S7e†) when compared to films with HMCl. This is due to the fast crystallization speed and oxidation of Sn2+.35,63 After the addition of HMCl, the morphology of the film evidently improves. Fig. S7b–d† show morphologies for films with different contents of HMCl. When 20% (mole ratio with FASnI3) HMCl is added to the film, the perovskite film exhibits better uniform grains and less pinholes compared with other films (Fig. S7a, b and d†). Based on the inverted structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/Sn-based perovskite/PCBM/BCP/Ag (Fig. S1b†), we also explored the effect of HMCl on the performance of Sn-based perovskite solar cells. As shown in Fig. S7f and Table S2,† after HMCl is added to the film, the device performance evidently improves. When the added amount is 20%, the device exhibits the highest PCE of 5.95% when compared to 2.29% for the control device. This is consistent with the morphology of the film. The addition of HMCl inhibits oxidation of Sn2+ and decreases the crystallization speed of the Sn-based film to decrease the generation of Sn vacancies and defects,61 which improves the morphology and performance of the film. However, when HMCl is excessive, it hinders the crystallization process and deteriorates film performance. For example, when 30% HMCl is added, the grains become slightly uneven with the appearance of pinholes such that the device performance decreases.
Hence, the importance of HMCl is proven in terms of enhancing film morphology and inhibiting oxidation of Sn2+. In this study, we examine the effect of two team-working hydrochlorides on film qualities, and verify the inference shown in Fig. 1e–g. When compared with 3D perovskite films, low dimension perovskite films exhibit better stability and more marked aeolotropy. Previous studies21,64 suggest that a 2D Pb-based perovskite film can be formed by introducing a small amount of larger cations. In the study, DEA+ was used as the larger cation to prepare a quasi-2D Sn-based perovskite film. First, we explored the effect of additives on the surface morphology of the film. As shown in Fig. 2a–c, the morphology of different films is observed via the SEM measurement. Grains and morphology significantly change with the addition of HMCl and DEACl. The most evident difference is the grain size of crystals and film coverage. In the control film, the film exhibits many pinholes, and the grain size is close to 1 μm (Fig. 2a). However, after the addition of HMCl, the pinholes are significantly reduced, and the grain size is slightly increased to 1–2 μm (Fig. 2b). When DEA+ is added, the crystal grains enlarge close to 4 μm (Fig. 2c), which can be related to the size of DEA+ and the synergistic effect of the two hydrochlorides.65 The large crystals aid in carrier transfer and light absorption.66 The additives affect film morphology, and also improve crystallization orientation. Subsequently, we performed the XRD measurement shown in Fig. 2d–f. As shown in Fig. 2d, the characteristic peak corresponding to the (120) plane disappears after the addition of DEACl, and the diffraction intensity evidently improves, thereby demonstrating the effect of introduced large cations on the crystallinity of the perovskite film. Moreover, a new small-angle peak appears at 8° (details shown in the inset of Fig. 2d), which indicates the formation of quasi-2D perovskite.59Fig. 2e shows the positions and intensities of the peaks corresponding to the (101) and (202) planes of different films. The characteristic peaks exhibit a significant left shift, which is related to the lattice mismatches due to the introduced ions.67 Simultaneously, the steric hindrance of the introduced ions directly affects the offset of the characteristic peak. When compared with N2H5+, DEA+ exhibits a larger steric hindrance, and thus the characteristic peaks of the film with DEA+ exhibit a higher shift. Fig. 2f shows the full width at half maximum (FWHM) as a function of the additive for the (101) and (202) diffraction peaks. The FWHM of the plane decreases with the addition of additives, thereby indicating an increase in the crystallinity and grain size of the film. The trend of the FWHM corresponds to the change in grain size with respect to different additives as shown in Fig. 2a–c.

The measurement of grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) is performed to further investigate the effect of the two additives on the crystal orientation of quasi-2D perovskite films. As shown in Fig. 2g–i, the GIWAXS spectrum exhibits a slight change when only HMCl is added. The Debye–Scherrer-like rings correspond to dominant peaks in the XRD pattern, thereby indicating that the grain orientation is random. With the addition of DEACl, the GIWAXS spectrum suggests that the ring begins to fade and Bragg spots appear (Fig. 2i), thereby suggesting that the grain orientation begins to change from random to ordered.68 Moreover, the GIWAXS spectrum of the film with DEACl exhibits (0k0) Bragg spots in qxy < 0.5, and thus indicates the formation of the quasi-2D Sn-based perovskite (DEA2FA8Sn9I28−xClx), which corresponds to the low-angle peaks in the XRD pattern as shown in Fig. 2d.64,69 After the addition of DEACl, the schematic diagram of the formation of quasi-2D DEA2FA8Sn9I28−xClx is shown in Fig. 2j. These results verify the schematic shown in Fig. 1e–g.
Light absorption also changes given the effect of additives on morphology and crystallization of perovskite films. The UV-vis absorption spectra of different films are tested to examine the effect of the additives on film absorption (Fig. S8a†). After the addition of HMCl and DEACl, the absorbance of the 2D DEA2FA8Sn9I28−xClx film increases significantly, thereby indicating that the compactness and coverage of the film improves. The narrowed absorption range shows changes in photon energy from 1.33 eV to 1.36 eV and 1.42 eV with the addition of HMCl and DEACl (Fig. S8b†). This can improve the energy level matching of Sn-based perovskite and transport layer materials, which in turn can increase VOC.54
The performances of devices are investigated based on perovskite films with different additives. Fig. 3a shows J–V curves of the control and additive incorporated devices measured under simulated AM 1.5 G irradiation with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2. The control device exhibits a PCE value of only 2.29% given the presence of several pinholes in the perovskite film and serious oxidation of Sn4+. The device performance with the addition of DEACl (20%) alone is shown in Fig. S9 and Table S4.† The DEA-based device shows a PCE of 3.67% with a VOC of 0.493 V, JSC of 14.39 mA cm−2, and FF of 51.71. With the addition of 0.2 M HMCl, the PCE value of the device reaches 5.95% with a VOC of 0.396 V, JSC of 22.7 mA cm−2 and FF of 66.22. When HMCl and DEACl are added, the champion PCE of the DEA2FA8Sn9I28−xClx device corresponds to 9.47% with a VOC of 0.601 V, JSC of 21.0 mA cm−2, and FF of 75.03 (Table 1). Fig. 3b shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE) and EQE-based integrated JSC of the investigated devices. When HMCl and DEACl are added, the EQE range also significantly changes, which is consistent with the change in the absorption spectrum. Due to the narrowed absorption, the JSC of the device with HMCl and DEACl added is lower compared with the device with HMCl. The statistics of the PCE distribution and Gaussian distribution fitting lines are shown in Fig. 3c. Fig. 3d shows the results of the stabilized maximal power output and corresponding current density of the 2D device. The photocurrent (18.26 mA cm−2) remains stable within 300 s at 0.5 V, and this indicates that the device exhibits good stability under output conditions.

The team-working hydrochlorides exert a significant effect on the photoelectronic character of Sn-perovskite films, and thus we measure their photoluminescence characters and investigate the carrier lifetimes. Steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurements are tested for the perovskite films deposited on a glass substrate. As shown in Fig. 3e, the film with HMCl and DEACl added exhibits higher PL, indicating a better film quality, which is in agreement with the XRD patterns and SEM images.70 Furthermore, the increased PL intensity of the film indicates that the addition of HMCl and DEACl significantly reduces non-radiative recombination in the film.71 Moreover, the blue shift of the PL peak indicates changes in the band gap and formation of a quasi-2D structure.33,44 The TRPL is measured at the emission peak and exhibited an obvious bi-exponential decay behavior (Fig. 3f). The fast decay lifetime τ1 corresponds to trap-assisted non-radiative recombination while the slow decay lifetime τ2 corresponds to radiative recombination of the free carriers.70,72 With the addition of HMCl and DEACl, the decay lifetime τ1 and τ2 significantly increase to 7.92 ns and 16.32 ns from 2.14 ns and 7.43 ns for the control film (Table S3†), respectively, thereby suggesting an increase in the carriers' transmission distance, which is crucial for device performance.
To examine changes in the hole trap density and carrier mobility in the perovskite film after addition of HMCl and DEACl, space-charge-limited current (SCLC) measurement is conducted via the hole-only device with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/Sn-based perovskite/P3HT/Ag. The dark current–voltage (J–V) curves of the hole-only device are shown in Fig. 3g, with the three typical regions, namely the ohmic region, the trap-filled limit region and the SCLC region. The trap density (Ntrap) is determined as follows: (4)where VTFL denotes the trap-filled limit voltage, q denotes the unit charge (q = 1.6 × 10−19 C), L denotes the perovskite film thickness, ε denotes the relative dielectric constant of perovskite (ε = 32), and ε0 denotes the vacuum permittivity (ε0 = 8.854 × 10−12 F m−1).43 Finally, we calculated the Ntrap of the three films to be 6.44 × 1015 cm−3 (control film), 1.242 × 1015 cm−3 (with HMCl), and 1.126 × 1015 cm−3 (with HMCl and DEACl), respectively. The reduction in trap density is potentially because HMCl and DEACl (especially HMCl) can reduce defects by suppressing the oxidation of Sn2+, which aids in improving the VOC of the device. The carrier mobility (μ) of the perovskite film is determined by using the Mott–Gurney law as follows: (5)where JD denotes the dark current density in the SCLC region, and V denotes the applied voltage in the SCLC region.2 The hole mobilities of the three Sn-based perovskite films are 1.2524 × 10−4 cm−2 V−1 s−1 (control film), 1.0043 × 10−3 cm−2 V−1 s−1 (with HMCl), and 4.4581 × 10−3 cm−2 V−1 s−1 (with HMCl and DEACl). The specific parameters of Ntrap and μ are listed in Table S5.† Increased carrier mobility suggests the promoting effect of HMCl and DEACl on Sn-based perovskite devices, which is mainly attributed to the improvement in film morphology and crystallinity and the passivation of defects. The SCLC measurement has its own limitations, including defect concentration, ion movement and other factors that will affect the accuracy of the results,73,74 but it does not affect the qualitative analysis of Sn-based perovskites.33,43 From the above analysis, it can be qualitatively concluded that the addition of HMCl and DEACl effectively suppresses the trap density and improves the carrier mobility in Sn-based perovskite films.
Electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is measured in the dark at a voltage of VOC and over a frequency range of 0.1–2 MHz. Under the test condition, the equivalent circuit can be simplified to the circuit model shown in the top right inset of Fig. 3h. The charge transfer resistance (Rct) of the device is significantly lower than the recombination resistance (Rrec), and thus the difference in EIS is mainly due to Rrec. After the addition of HMCl and DEACl, the Rrec of the device significantly increases due to the reduction of defect states and suppression of carrier recombination, which is exactly consistent with the PL test (Fig. 3e). Fig. 3i shows the light intensity dependence of VOC for devices with different additives, which further confirms the effect of trap-assisted non-radiative recombination on the device performance. The slope (n KT/q) of the fitting line is closer to 1 KT/q if the device exhibits a lower non-radiative recombination, where K denotes the Boltzmann constant, T denotes the temperature in kelvin, and q denotes the unit charge.75,76 The value of n for the device with HMCl and DEACl is 1.23, which is significantly closer to 1 when compared to 1.52 and 1.75. This indicates that HMCl and DEACl reduced trap-assisted recombination by suppressing the oxidation of Sn2+ in the perovskite film. Fig. S11a† shows the dark J–V curves of the device with different additives. When compared to the control device, the dark current density of the device with HMCl and DEACl added is lower, thereby indicating that HMCl and DEACl effectively reduce the intrinsic carrier concentration in films and suppress the non-radiative recombination of the devices. Thus the higher VOC of the device with the addition of HMCl and DEACl mainly originated from the suppression of trap-assisted non-radiative recombination.
As mentioned above, the quasi-2D structure of Sn-based perovskite significantly affects device performance. In traditional 2D perovskites, larger cations, such as PEA+ and BA+, are employed to occupy the position of FA+. In the study, we use a novel amine salt of DEACl to form the 2D structure given its lower steric hindrance. Previous studies examined the advantage of DEA+ in 2D perovskite material with better photoelectronic qualities. Fig. 4a shows the chemical structures of DEA+, PEA+, and BA+. To compare the differences in electrostatic potential (ESP) and steric hindrance of the three large cations, density functional theory (DFT) is used to obtain the visualized electron density distribution as shown in Fig. 4b. The electron-deficient area (positive area) is mainly distributed on the amino group and provides a favorable condition for coordination with [SnI6]2− octahedra.77 Additionally, we prepared a device with the same amount (20%) of addition to explore the effects of the three cations. As shown in Fig. S10,† the VOC of the devices are nearly similar although the JSCs are evidently different. When compared with PEA+ and BA+, DEA+ exhibits a smaller steric hindrance, which is better for carrier transport. Moreover, DEA+ displays a smaller molecular polarity index (MPI) than BA+, and thus the device with DEA+ shows a higher JSC. The corresponding parameters are listed in Table S6† and Fig. 4c–e.

To investigate the effect of different additives on the device durability under light conditions, JSC–T curves of the devices are measured under AM 1.5 G irradiation (Fig. S11b†). The control device exhibits poor durability wherein the JSC begins to decrease after 600 s. The device with HMCl and DEACl added exhibits slight increases in JSC when the test time is delayed to 2000 s. To further investigate the effect of HMCl and DEACl on device stability, aging tests of unencapsulated devices are performed in air with a humidity of 60% and in a N2-filled glove box (temperature is approximately 30 °C, Fig. 5), respectively. It is easy for the control device to produce defects (white spots on the control device in Fig. 5a) during the preparation process, which accelerates the decomposition of the perovskite film in air. The images (Fig. 5a) suggest that the degradation rate of the device evidently decelerates when HMCl and DEACl are added, which is mainly due to the synergistic effect of the two hydrochlorides in the perovskite device. As shown in Fig. 5b and c, whether in air or in the N2-filled glove box, similar to the perovskite solution in Fig. S2,† devices with two hydrochlorides showed the strongest stability. This is closely related to their synergy in the Sn-based perovskite film. The contact angle test result of the perovskite films is shown in Fig. 5d, and the surface contact angle significantly increases from 33° to 80° under the action of HMCl and DEACl. Although separate addition of DEACl and HMCl improves the hydrophobicity of the film due to its own characteristics, the synergistic effect of DEACl and HMCl maximizes the contact angle of the 2D DEA2FA8Sn9I28−xClx film and leads to optimal stability. The results prove that HMCl effectively inhibits the oxidation of Sn2+ when DEACl reduces the dimensionality of the perovskite, and the synergistic effect of the two hydrochlorides improves photoelectric conversion and stability of the Sn-based perovskite device.

Experimental section
Device fabrication
SnI2, DEACl, DMF and DMSO were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich and FAI and SnF2 were obtained from Xi'an Polymer Light Technology Corp. The precursor solution of FASnI3 was prepared by dissolving FAI, SnI2, and SnF2 (mole ratio of 1:1:0.1) in the mixed solvent of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) with a volume ratio of 4:1. The concentration of the solution was 1 mol L−1, and HMCl and DEACl were added at a concentration of 0.2 mol L−1. To obtain the DEA2FA8Sn9I28−xClx 2D Sn-based perovskite film, the ratio of raw materials corresponded to FAI:SnI2:SnF2:HMCl:DEACl = 0.8:1:0.1:0.2:0.2. The precursor solution was stirred at room temperature for 24 h before spin-coating. The indium tin oxide (ITO) coated glass substrates were sequentially ultrasonically washed with acetone, abstergent aqueous solution, deionized water, and isopropanol for 30 min. First, the ITO-coated glass was treated with oxygen plasma for 30 min, spin-coated with PEDOT:PSS (4083, Xi'an Polymer Light Technology Corp) in air, and then the PEDOT:PSS was then transferred into a glove box and annealed at 130 °C for 1 h. Subsequently, 40 μL perovskite precursor solution was dropped on the PEDOT:PSS and it was spin-coated at a speed of 4000 rpm for 30 s. At the 10th second during the spin coating process, 200 μL chlorobenzene was dropped on the surface of the perovskite to promote crystallization, and the perovskite film was then annealed at 90 °C for 10 min in a N2-filled glove box. After the perovskite film was formed, the PC61BM solution (15 mg mL−1 in chlorobenzene) was spin-coated on top of the perovskite film. Finally, 8 nm BCP and 100 nm silver (Ag) films were deposited on top of the PC61BM layer via a thermal-evaporation process in a vacuum chamber with a pressure of less than 10−4 Pa.
Device and film characterization
GIWAXS was tested via a grazing incidence angle X-ray scattering system (Xenocs, Xeuss 2.0) equipped with Excillum's liquid metal target light source and Dectris's Pilatus 3R 1M type two-dimensional detector. The J–V curves were recorded using a Keithley 2400 source meter unit under AM 1.5 irradiation with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2 provided by a solar simulator (GLORIA-X500A, Zolix) with a shadow mask area (0.12 cm2), and the device area was 0.12 cm2. The XRD patterns were recorded on a D8-Discover 25 diffractometer (Bruker). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo Fisher, ESCALAB 250Xi) was used to detect the contents of Sn2+ and Sn4+. The UV-vis absorption spectra were measured via a PerkinElmer, Lambda 950. Furthermore, photoluminescence (PL) spectra and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra were measured via photoluminescence spectroscopy (Edinburgh FLS1000 spectrometer), the excitation wavelength for the PL measurements was 375 nm, and TRPL was tested at the strongest emission wavelength (approximately 835 nm). The EIS measurements were conducted using a frequency response analyzer (PSM1735 Numetri Q) from 1 to 106 Hz under dark conditions at an applied VOC. The EQE was tested via an EQE measurement system (NEWPORT, 69920).
Conclusions
In summary, the results indicated that high-quality 2D DEA2FA8Sn9I28−xClx perovskite solar cells can be obtained via simultaneous addition of HMCl and DEACl. The addition of HMCl and DEACl decelerates the crystallization rate and improves the morphology and crystallinity of a Sn-based perovskite film. More importantly, under the synergistic effect of the two hydrochlorides, the perovskite crystal changes from a 3D to 2D structure while reducing the contact between oxygen and Sn2+ and the contact between N2H5+ and Sn2+ increases between the crystal inner layer such that the crystal orientation changes in a more orderly manner and the phase distribution becomes more uniform. Additionally, given the decrease in the self-doping effect due to tin oxidation, the trap density was significantly reduced and carrier mobility evidently increased in the DEA2FA8Sn9I28−xClx film, which is very conducive to improvements in device performance. The electrostatic potential (ESP) calculated using DFT and experimental results further confirm that DEA+ is more conducive to carrier transport than BA+ and PEA+. Moreover, the hydrophobic properties of the large cation (DEA+) and high film quality improve the device stability in air or a N2-filled glove box. Hence, the quasi-2D DEA2FA8Sn9I28−xClx perovskite solar cells realize a highly enhanced stability and a PCE of 9.47% due to increases in VOC. The study provides a comprehensive understanding of the synergistic effect of the two hydrochlorides and presents a promising strategy to realize high performance 2D Sn-based perovskite devices with high stability.
