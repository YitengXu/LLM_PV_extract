, Accepted 27th August 2013First published on 28th August 2013AbstractSmall domains of cobalt on silica (CoSBA) were prepared by the reaction of Co[N(SiMe3)2]2 and SBA-15, resulting in a range of surface structures as the cobalt loading varied from 0.27 to 5.11 wt%. X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) was employed to characterize these surface structures, which range from single-site cobalt atoms to small clusters of Co3O4. The CoSBA materials exhibit photochemical water oxidation catalysis, revealing distinct catalytic activities associated with characteristic types of surface structures that are dominant in particular concentration regimes. The catalytic turnover frequency for water oxidation of an isolated single-site cobalt atom (0.0143 s−1) is much greater than that observed for a surface atom of a small cluster Co3O4 on silica (0.0006 s−1). The CoSBA catalysts were recyclable for more than seven catalytic cycles (>200 turnovers) with additional sacrificial oxidant, and no leaching of cobalt was observed. Post-catalytic analysis of CoSBA by XAS revealed that the cobalt atoms were partially oxidized to Co3+, without exhibiting significant surface migration and aggregation of cobalt atoms.

Broader context
Direct production of fuels from sunlight is one of the most intensely researched topics today. Generation of transportable liquid fuels from solar energy is particularly attractive because of the abundant solar flux and the possibility of producing fuels compatible with the current industrial infrastructures. Water is an abundant and environmentally benign electron source suitable for numerous applications in solar energy conversion to chemical fuels, and yet the reaction mechanism and the structural requirements for an active catalyst for the water oxidation reaction remain poorly understood. This work is intended to probe the catalytic behavior of very small surface-bound cobalt species on a silica surface, from single-site cobalt atoms to small domains of cobalt oxide. Distinct cobalt surface concentration regimes were identified, in terms of catalytic activities, and dominant structures for these regimes are associated with specific cluster nuclearities, as determined by spectroscopic methods. The synthetic strategy described here should serve as a useful methodology for evaluations of various catalysts, surface structures, and reaction conditions.

Introduction
Many of the current research activities directed toward development of new sources of renewable energy focus on the photogeneration of chemical fuels (artificial photosynthesis).1 This interest is heavily centered on the use of water as a feedstock, and low-energy pathways for its activation and conversion. In particular, the oxidative half-reaction of water to oxygen is envisioned as a potentially useful source of protons and electrons that might be used in reductive, fuel-producing reactions (e.g., the direct reduction of protons to H2, or CO2 reductions to hydrocarbons).1 This has motivated considerable research directed toward discovery of efficient water oxidation catalysts,2–20 and in particular catalysts based on abundant first-row transition metals.10–20 Viable catalysts are generally considered to be heterogeneous and long-lived under conditions that provide turnover frequencies (TOFs) consistent with high conversion of the incident sunlight.21
A number of heterogeneous, first-row transition metal catalysts for the oxidation of water have been investigated,10–20 with a particular emphasis on catalysts based on cobalt. These cobalt catalysts have taken various forms, including nanoparticles and thin films,10–20 and the CoPi catalyst described by Nocera and coworkers has drawn considerable attention.10,11 In comparing various cobalt-based catalysts, it is useful to determine activity under a given set of experimental conditions, on a per-cobalt basis. Thus, a useful benchmark for cobalt-based catalysts would be the inherent activity associated with the smallest functional unit for the catalyst. With this information in hand, it should be possible to probe the influence of local environments (e.g. the nature of the support material) on catalyst efficiency. Lymar and coworkers have recently described the activity of small [Co(OH)2]x clusters (ca. 25 Co atoms, ∼2 nm) supported on silica.19 For the CoPi catalyst, the active site is believed to be composed of fused cobalt oxo cubane units containing ca. 7 Co atoms.11 However, the inherent water oxidation activity for heterogeneous cobalt clusters smaller than 2 nm, or more importantly that of a single cobalt atom on a surface, remains undetermined. It is therefore important to investigate the catalytic activities of very small cobalt species on a surface, from isolated, single-site cobalt centers to clusters of several atoms, in order to better understand the structural requirements for water oxidation by heterogeneous cobalt species.
This contribution describes an investigation of the activities of small-domain cobalt species supported on mesoporous silica surfaces (SBA-15). Several surface concentration regimes are characterized by dominant surface structures, ranging from isolated single cobalt centers to small clusters of Co3O4 (<2 nm). Characteristic activities for catalytic water oxidation are associated with different surface concentration regimes, with the highest being exhibited by isolated cobalt centers. All of the catalyst samples displayed prolonged activity in pH 5.5-buffered water with no leaching of metal centers over 6 h.
Experimental
General
All manipulations were conducted under an inert nitrogen atmosphere using standard Schlenk techniques or a Vacuum Atmospheres drybox, unless otherwise stated. Chemicals were purchased from Aldrich and used as received. Dry, oxygen free solvents were used throughout. The compound Co[N(SiMe3)2]2 (ref. 23) and mesoporous SBA-15 (ref. 22) were synthesized as reported in the literature. Nitrogen adsorption isotherms were obtained using a Quantachrome Autosorb 1, with samples outgassed at 120 °C for at least 20 h prior to data collection. The BET method was used for surface area determinations, and the BJH method was used for pore size distribution calculations.50,51 Carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen elemental analyses were performed at the College of Chemistry microanalysis laboratory at the University of California, Berkeley. DR-FTIR spectra were obtained on a Thermo Nicolet 6700 FTIR spectrometer. The DRUV-Vis spectra were acquired using a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 9 spectrometer equipped with a 60 mm integrating sphere, a slit width of 4 nm, and at a collection speed of 120 nm min−1. Samples were run using MgO as a reference background. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns were recorded on a Bruker D-8 GADDS X-ray diffractometer using Co Kα radiation (λ = 1.7902 Å). The pH measurements were conducted using a Thermo Orion 2 star pH meter. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was carried out on a Philips Tecnai 12 transmission electron microscope operating at 200 kV. Raman experiments were performed on an epi-illumination confocal Raman microscope (LabRam HR, Horiba Jobin, Yvon) with a HeNe laser (1 mW) at 633 nm as an excitation source. Inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) for cobalt ion detection in post catalytic solutions was performed on a Perkin-Elmer ICP-OES Optima 7000 DV (detection limit for Co ions: 0.25 ppb). Standard solutions were purchased from Perkin-Elmer and used as received. Heat treatments were conducted in a Lindberg 1200 °C three-zone furnace. Solution 1H NMR spectra were recorded at 300 MHz using a Bruker AV-300 spectrometer. Chemical shifts for 1H NMR spectra were referenced internally to the residual solvent proton signal relative to tetramethylsilane. A Stanford Research Systems residual gas analyzer 300 was used for the detection of evolved gases in the 18O isotopic labeling experiments.
Syntheses of CoSBA materials
In a typical synthesis, Co[N(SiMe3)2]2 (32 mg, 84 μmol) in 25 mL of hexanes was added to a hexanes suspension of SBA-15 (1 g in 25 mL). The green solution of Co[N(SiMe3)2]2 instantaneously turned light blue as it came in contact with SBA-15. The resulting solution was stirred under nitrogen for 0.5 h, to yield a light blue solid and a clear supernatant. The CoSBA material was then washed thoroughly with hexanes and air dried. The dried material was then calcined under flowing air (110 cm3 min−1) to 300 °C for 6 h to remove residual organics.
X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) data collection
The combination of XANES/EXAFS spectra were collected at BL 10.3.2 in the Advanced Light Source (ALS) at LBNL, and at BL 7-3 at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource (SSRL). At the ALS, the synchrotron ring operated at 1.9 GeV at a 500 mA beam current. Energy resolution of the focused incoming X-rays at BL 10.3.2 was achieved using a Si(111) double-crystal monochromator. Fluorescence spectra were collected with a 7-element Ge detector, and transmission spectra were obtained with a I1 ion chamber filled with N2 gas. An incident X-ray beam of 0.1 mm (H) × 0.02 mm (V) dimensions was used for the XANES and EXAFS experiments. At SSRL, the electron energy was set at 3.0 GeV with an average current of 450 mA. A Si(220) double-crystal monochromator was used. Spectra were collected in fluorescence mode in a chamber filled with N2 gas. Energy calibrations are based on the rising edge energy of Co foil at 7709.0 eV (ALS) and at 7709.5 eV (SSRL). Each spectrum is the average of 6–9 scans. All measurements were done at room temperature.
Water oxidation catalysis experiments and oxygen detection
Light-driven water-oxidation reactions were performed in buffered water at pH 5.5–5.6 (NaHCO3/Na2SiF6) employing Na2S2O8 as a sacrificial electron acceptor. The sensitizer used for the experiments was [Ru(bpy)3]Cl2. Water was degassed to remove oxygen, by bubbling nitrogen through it for 1 h prior to experiments. A gas-tight glass cell with an internal volume of 37.6 mL was used. In a typical experiment, 40 mg of catalyst was used in 15 mL of buffered water along with 18 mg of [Ru(bpy)3]Cl2, 100 mg of Na2SO4 and 36 mg of Na2S2O8. A 488 nm laser with a power output of 260 mW, focused at a beam diameter of 0.5 cm, was used as the light source. The head-space oxygen concentration was monitored in real time by a multi-frequency fluorescence oxygen probe (Ocean Optics FOSPOR-R). The oxygen probe was freshly calibrated prior to being used in an experiment by a five-point calibration method at the following oxygen concentrations (vol%) in helium: 0, 1.68, 3.62, 6.38, and 20.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization of CoSBA-15 samples
The high surface area (634 m2 g−1) SBA-15 silica material used to support cobalt species was prepared by a known procedure.22 For introduction of single-site cobalt species, the bis(amido) complex Co[N(SiMe3)2]2 (ref. 23) was employed. The choice of this molecular precursor was based on the successful use of similar complexes of Mg,24 Ti,25 Fe,26 and Nd27 for introduction of silica-supported, single-site metal centers by Anwander and coworkers. The CoSBA-15 materials were prepared by allowing a suspension of SBA-15 to react with Co[N(SiMe3)2]2 in hexanes, followed by filtration and washing of the resulting blue solids with hexanes and then calcination at 300 °C in air to remove residual organic material. Monitoring the surface functionalization reaction by 1H NMR spectroscopy demonstrated that this process results in elimination of 0.9(1) equiv. of HN(SiMe3)2 per cobalt complex (δ = 0.082 ppm in C6D6, measured against a ferrocene internal standard). The grafting reactions were complete within 30 min, as evidenced by the absence of cobalt in the supernatant solution by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES). An observed decrease in the surface area of the materials after grafting (Fig. 1) is similar to that observed for previously reported systems;29–32 however, a lack of decrease in the pore size (Fig. 1) suggests that the degree of silylation by HN(SiMe3)2 is minimal due to the short reaction times.28 On the basis of these observations, it appears that the initial grafting procedure gives a mono-amido cobalt(II) species, such as the one shown in Scheme 1.
 Fig. 1  Gas adsorption surface area of CoSBA materials as a function of cobalt loading (top). Loss of surface area with increased loading was comparable to similar systems studied previously. The pore diameter did not change significantly with loading (bottom), indicating that the mesoporous structure of SBA-15 was intact after the grafting procedures. 
 Scheme 1  Synthesis of CoSBA materials. 
Residual organic species were removed by calcination at 300 °C in air, to yield surface species closely related to the representative structures of Scheme 1. The all-inorganic nature of the CoSBA samples was verified by carbon and nitrogen elemental analyses (CHN found for CoSBA332: C, 0.10, H 0.90, N 0.06). After calcination of the grafted samples, losses in surface area with respect to the parent SBA-15 material were evident in all cases, with the highest decreases being associated with higher loadings (Fig. 1). These losses of surface area can be largely attributed to blockage of the micropores in the SBA-15 framework, and have been commonly observed in similar systems.24–27,29–32 No collapse of the ordered mesopores in SBA-15 was observed after cobalt grafting, as evidenced by the preserved average pore diameters (Fig. 1) and by TEM images (Fig. S8†). The surface cobalt coverage was varied by control of the amount of cobalt precursor employed, to produce materials with cobalt wt% values of 0.27 (CoSBA027), 0.48 (CoSBA048), 1.06 (CoSBA106), 1.89 (CoSBA189), 2.33 (CoSBA233), 3.32 (CoSBA332), 4.16 (CoSBA416), and 5.11 (CoSBA511).
The cobalt surface species were characterized by a number of spectroscopic methods. Diffuse reflectance FTIR (DRFTIR) spectra reveal a diminished SiO–H vibration29–32 at 3750 cm−1 in all samples after cobalt grafting, with the corresponding appearance of an Si–O–Co vibration33 at 960 cm−1 (Fig. S2†). This indicates that the cobalt species are covalently bound to the silica surface via reactions at surface hydroxyl sites, to generate the Si–O–Co linkage. The coordination geometries of the cobalt species on CoSBA027, CoSBA048, CoSBA106, CoSBA189, CoSBA233, and CoSBA332 were probed by diffuse reflectance UV-vis spectroscopy (DRUV-vis), which indicated the presence of d–d transitions (λmax = 530, 580, and 650 nm, Fig. S3†) consistent with cobalt(II) centers with pseudotetrahedral coordination environments.34,35 The DRUV-vis spectra of CoSBA416 and CoSBA511 were distinctly different, in possessing a broad feature at 350 nm which is characteristic of Co3O4 domains (Fig. S4†).36,37 The formation of Co3O4 in samples with higher cobalt loadings was expected due to the limited surface density of –OH sites on SBA-15 prior to reaction with the precursor (ca. 1.2 nm−2, determined by a titration method described in the ESI†). The cobalt loading that corresponds to complete reaction of the surface –OH sites is 3.72 wt% cobalt. Thus, loadings above this value are expected to result in condensation of the surface cobalt species. Raman spectroscopy of the CoSBA samples corroborated the formation of Co3O4 spinel in CoSBA416 and CoSBA511. Raman features characteristic of cobalt oxide,38 at 485, 505, and 691 cm−1, were observed for CoSBA416 and CoSBA511, whereas the only peak observed for lower loadings was a broad feature at ca. 500 cm−1, which may be assigned to a Co–O vibration (Fig. S5†).33,38 The observed cobalt oxide domains were small, such that wide angle powder X-ray diffraction (pXRD) exhibited no discernible features.
X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopies were implemented to further investigate the oxidation states and local environments of the surface metal species. XANES spectra of the CoSBA-15 samples (Fig. 2) exhibit a cobalt edge energy of ca. 7719.5 eV, suggesting an oxidation state for the surface cobalt atoms of 2+ (ref. 39–41) and corroborating the results from DRUV-vis spectroscopy. A pre-edge feature (1s to 3d transition) in the XANES spectra of the samples with lower coverages (CoSBA027, CoSBA048, CoSBA106, CoSBA189, and CoSBA332; Fig. S6†) was observed at ca. 7709 eV, suggesting that the cobalt centers are in tetrahedral coordination environments. However, CoSBA511 revealed an edge position at ca. 7723.2 eV, indicating a presence of more oxidized Co form, and the spectrum is similar to that observed for Co3O4 (Fig. 2). This is consistent with evidence provided by other spectroscopies (vide supra), which suggest the presence of Co3O4 in CoSBA511. An inhomogeneous distribution of surface sites was observed in the CoSBA511 sample by XANES and EXAFS, due to the large excess of cobalt atoms compared to the available Si–OH grafting sites (vide supra). Small domains of fully formed Co3O4 were observed as displayed in the XANES spectrum in Fig. 2, whereas XANES spectra similar to that of CoSBA048 (or other low concentration samples) were also obtained from different parts of the CoSBA511 sample (see Fig. S7†). This finding, along with the lack of an observable pXRD pattern, suggests that very small domains of Co3O4 are present in CoSBA511, such that it is reasonable to assume that much of the cobalt is exposed on the material's surface, and is available to participate in catalytic reactions. No blockage of SBA-15 channels was observed and no particles bigger than the resolution of the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) instrument (ca. 2 nm) were present in SBA-15 channels (Fig. S8†).
 Fig. 2  XANES (top) and EXAFS (bottom) spectra of selected CoSBA samples. CoSBA-PC denotes CoSBA106 after catalysis cycles. XANES of low loading CoSBA samples exhibited an edge energy suggestive of Co2+. Similar XANES spectra were recorded for CoSBA511 and Co3O4, indicating that cobalt oxide has formed in CoSBA511. The EXAFS spectrum of CoSBA027 displays an excellent fit against the model, supporting the surface structures depicted in Scheme 1. 
The local coordination environments of the cobalt centers in CoSBA-15 samples were investigated using EXAFS spectroscopy, which indicates that the cobalt coordination environments in CoSBA027 and CoSBA048 are very similar, as are those of CoSBA189 and CoSBA332. Overall, among eight CoSBA samples, four distinct types of surface species were identified by the EXAFS data. Surface structure types A (CoSBA027, CoSBA048), B (CoSBA106), and C (CoSBA189, CoSBA233, CoSBA332) are distinguished by the average number of Co–O–Co interactions obtained by the EXAFS fits, as depicted by the representative structures of Scheme 1, and the presence of Co3O4 (in CoSBA416 and CoSBA511) was established by the spectroscopic information described above (see ESI† for details of the EXAFS fitting). Note that the structures depicted in Scheme 1 are consistent with the fittings of EXAFS data, and are representative of the types of species that would possess a given nuclearity. Three fitting paths (Co–O, Co–O–Co, and Co–O–Si) were employed in modeling the data, comparable to the EXAFS modeling work by Frei and coworkers on structurally similar systems on SBA-15.47–49 Structure type A exhibited a Co–O–Co coordination number (CN) of 0.4, indicating a predominance of isolated, single-site cobalt centers on the surface. It is reasonable to observe a non-zero value for the number of Co–O–Co interactions at even the lowest loadings, since it is well known that some of the silica surface hydroxyl groups exist in pairs, or in closely associated groups.42–44 Surface structure type B can best be described as a μ2-oxy or μ2-hydroxy dicobalt species, exhibiting a Co–O–Co coordination number (CN) of 1.2 at an interaction distance of ca. 2.89 Å, similar to that seen in Co3O4 or molecular compounds with the same structural moiety.45,46 The formation of small clusters of structure type C is indicated by a calculated Co–O–Co CN of 2.3 as depicted in Scheme 1. For all structures, the best fits were obtained with a Co–O CN of 5 and a Co–O–Si CN of 2, supporting a bipodal surface anchoring of each cobalt atom on SBA-15. The observed Co–O (ca. 2.05 Å) and Co–O–Si (ca. 3.25 Å) distances are consistent throughout all samples, with only slight variations (see ESI† for detailed fit results, bond distances, and coordination numbers).
Photochemically driven water oxidation catalysis with CoSBA catalysts
Light-driven water-oxidation reactions were observed for the series of CoSBA materials described above as catalysts. A buffered aqueous solution at pH 5.5–5.6 (NaHCO3/Na2SiF6) was used, and Na2S2O8 was employed as a sacrificial electron acceptor.3,12 A 488 nm laser with a power output of 260 mW and a focused beam diameter of 0.5 cm was used as the light source. Real-time oxygen monitoring was conducted in the headspace of the reactor using a fluorescence-based oxygen probe. The same amount of catalyst (40 mg) was used for each experiment.
All of the samples in the CoSBA series were observed to be active water oxidation catalysts, with varying activities (oxygen evolution as a function of time is shown in Fig. 3 and S9†). Oxygen evolution was not observed when SBA-15 without cobalt was subjected to catalytic conditions (Fig. S9†). To ensure that the detected O2 was derived from water, an 18O labeling experiment was performed using CoSBA048 as the catalyst. The water was enriched with 5.5 vol% of H218O (0.9 mL of 97% H218O in 16 mL total volume), resulting in a theoretical 16O2:16O18O:18O2 distribution of 89.3:10.4:0.3 (Table S1†). The experimental oxygen distribution measured by mass spectrometry was 89.8:10.2:trace (the 18O2 was detected with poor S/N and the peak integration was not reliable; see Figure S15 and Table S1†). Thus, the measured isotopic distribution indicates that water was the sole source of oxygen in the reaction. A similar distribution was observed when CoSBA233 was used as the catalyst.
 Fig. 3  Oxygen evolution of CoSBA catalysts over time (top). An increase in product formation was observed with increasing surface concentration to CoSBA106, with a decrease in the overall product formation transitioning to CoSBA189, suggesting the involvement of a different catalytic species (structure C, Scheme 1). The CoSBA catalysts exhibited recyclability with further additions of oxidant, and catalysis continued for more than 6 hours and 200 turnovers (bottom). 
The spinel oxide of cobalt (Co3O4) is a well known water oxidation catalyst, and has been extensively studied in the past.12–15 Thus, it is not surprising to observe catalytic activities for CoSBA416 and CoSBA511, for which small domains of Co3O4 exist on the SBA-15 surface. Relevant work by Frei and coworkers has demonstrated comparable catalytic activity for cobalt oxide nanorods grown inside the mesopores of SBA-15.12 However, determinations of activities for very small cobalt domains (from single-site cobalt to clusters of several cobalt atoms) have not been reported.
On the basis of a kinetic study on water oxidation by the aqueous cobalt ion, Sutin and coworkers proposed a mechanism involving the cobalt-catalyzed, two-electron oxidation of water to H2O2, followed by rapid oxidation of H2O2 to oxygen by the available oxidant (Ru3+).16 This work suggests that a single, surface cobalt species may function as a water oxidation catalyst. Consistent with this, the smallest surface domains of cobalt are associated with the highest initial turnover frequency (TOFi), with the material possessing the highest loading of single-site cobalt centers (structure type A) exhibiting the highest TOFi value of 0.0143 s−1 Co−1 (51.5 h−1 Co−1, Fig. 4). This TOFi of ca. 0.01 s−1 Co−1 is comparable to the rates reported for highly active first-row metal oxide-type materials.12 It is important to note that nearly all cobalt centers in CoSBA likely participate in catalysis, whereas only a fraction of metal atoms are active in the outer-most layer of metal oxide-type catalysts. Thus, catalytic metal centers are economically utilized in the CoSBA catalysts, though they are less compact on the surface.
 Fig. 4  TOFi plotted against increasing cobalt loading (top). TOFi values decrease with increasing surface concentration. Examination of the total amount of O2 produced as a function of cobalt loading (bottom) suggests the presence of distinct catalyst loading regimes, which correspond to the predominance of different surfaces species for each concentration range (Scheme 1). The amount of sacrificial oxidant in each experiment (151 μmol) corresponds to a theoretical maximum production of 75 μmol of O2. 
These results reveal that, on a per-metal basis, surface single-site cobalt centers are more active for water oxidation than the surface cobalt sites of cobalt oxide. The TOFi of 0.0143 s−1 Co−1 observed for CoSBA027 is orders of magnitude greater than that estimated for a surface atom of bulk Co3O4 (0.0006 s−1 Co−1, ref. 12; 0.0002 s−1 Co−1 from this work), and greater than that of many other nanostructured systems.12 Water oxidation by these CoSBA materials continued for more than 6 h and 200 turnovers with added amounts of Na2S2O8 (Fig. 3). No leaching of cobalt ions into solution was observed by ICP-OES analysis of the post-catalytic solutions. Observation of similar TOFi values after seven subsequent runs with the same catalyst (but with freshly added oxidant) suggests that the CoSBA catalysts are stable and long-lived under these reaction conditions. It is worth noting that the TOFi values reported here are effective values subject to being influenced by diffusion of the Ru(bpy)32+ sensitizer and the oxidant (S2O82−) and therefore cannot be directly compared to TOF values in other works obtained by different means. Internal comparisons amongst CoSBA samples of different surface nuclearities, however, are meaningful because all samples are evaluated under the same conditions.
Initial rates for water oxidation with the CoSBA catalysts, expressed in per-metal turnovers per hour, were plotted as a function of cobalt loading on the surface (Fig. 4; see ESI† for detailed turnover frequency calculations). Distinct rate behaviors for various structural types (A, B, C, and Co3O4) were observed, with single-site cobalt exhibiting the greatest catalytic activity. As shown in Fig. 4, there is a clear decrease in TOFi with increased cobalt loading. Samples of the same structural type displayed similar TOFi values (CoSBA027 and CoSBA048 in A and CoSBA189, CoSBA233, and CoSBA332 in C; see Fig. 4). The trends displayed by the loading vs. TOFi plot (Fig. 4) suggest that the various structural types observed by EXAFS (structure types A, B, C, and Co3O4) are associated with a different water oxidation catalytic activity.
Fig. 4 also presents a plot of the total O2 yield as a function of catalyst loading (with the sacrificial oxidant as limiting reagent). This data suggests that the different types of surface species mentioned above (A, B, C, Co3O4) exhibit markedly different catalytic behaviors. Thus, the yield of O2 increases with surface cobalt concentration through the regime associated with structure types A and B. A discontinuity in this plot appears to be associated with the structural change from structure type B to C, and then again from structure type C to Co3O4. It is proposed that the observed discontinuities are associated with changes in the predominant active species, since catalyst degradation is not observed over the course of these measurements (vide supra). The observed initial rates for the active sites for these catalysts span a wide range of TOFi values: as high as 51 h−1 Co−1 for CoSBA027 (single-site) to as low as 1 h−1 Co−1 for CoSBA511 (domains of Co3O4).
The amount of sacrificial oxidant used (151 μmol) corresponds to the theoretical maximum O2 yield of 75 μmol for each experiment. The maximum sacrificial oxidant efficiency (mol O2 produced divided by the theoretical maximum) obtained was 68% for CoSBA106, which is significantly higher than that observed for a similar system by Frei and coworkers (<51%).12 This difference is attributed to a higher TOF associated with well-dispersed CoSBA catalysts, as compared to nanostructured Co3O4. Note that a yield of 68% is relatively high considering the competing oxidative degradation of the Ru(bpy)32+ sensitizer.3
Structural characterization of the post-catalysis CoSBA samples
Post-catalysis samples were analyzed by X-ray absorption spectroscopy in order to probe changes in oxidation states and coordination environments. From the XANES spectrum in Fig. 2, the post-catalysis samples are more oxidized than the pre-catalysis samples, both of which contain Co2+ and Co3+. The edge energy of the post-catalysis sample was ca. 7721.2 eV, higher than that of the pre-catalysis samples and lower than that of Co3O4 (7723.2 eV), suggesting that the ratio of Co2+ to Co3+ is lower than 1:2.
Fitting of the EXAFS data for post catalytic CoSBA106 also suggests the presence of a more oxidized material after catalysis, in that a shorter average Co–O bond distance of ca. 1.96 Å is observed, as well as an increase in the Co–O CN to 5.6 (see ESI†). The Co–O–Co and Co–O–Si bond lengths were also reduced to 2.66 Å and 2.77 Å, respectively. However, Co–O–Co and Co–O–Si CNs did not significantly change after catalysis, and were found to be 1.7 and 2, respectively. The observed preservation of Co–O–Co and Co–O–Si CNs indicates that despite some changes in the average cobalt oxidation state, after many catalytic turnovers there is minimal surface restructuring and/or agglomeration of cobalt species.
Conclusions
The investigation described above presents a molecular approach to the creation of highly dispersed cobalt centers on a silica support. The high dispersion of the surface-bound cobalt, especially at low loadings, has allowed determination of the water oxidation activity, under the specific conditions employed, for structures approaching, and including, the single-cobalt-atom regime. These catalysts exhibit significant stabilities that allow comparisons of observed catalytic activities as a function of cobalt surface densities. On the basis of efficiencies for O2 production, the catalysts seem to be differentiated into ranges of loadings corresponding to differences in predominant surface structures. This work has allowed an estimate for the TOFi value associated with a mono-cobalt species on the surface of silica of ca. 0.01–0.02 s−1.
Similar ultra-low surface concentration regimes may exist with other metals on surfaces, and thus parallel studies on first-row metals of interest (Mn, Ni, etc.) are planned. Variations in the support material, for structurally similar and chemically distinct surface species, are also of interest. Additionally, the CoSBA systems described here are amenable to post-synthetic surface modifications,29,30 which should allow further investigations on the influence of a reaction center's local environment on catalytic performance.

Broader context
Direct production of fuels from sunlight is one of the most intensely researched topics today. Generation of transportable liquid fuels from solar energy is particularly attractive because of the abundant solar flux and the possibility of producing fuels compatible with the current industrial infrastructures. Water is an abundant and environmentally benign electron source suitable for numerous applications in solar energy conversion to chemical fuels, and yet the reaction mechanism and the structural requirements for an active catalyst for the water oxidation reaction remain poorly understood. This work is intended to probe the catalytic behavior of very small surface-bound cobalt species on a silica surface, from single-site cobalt atoms to small domains of cobalt oxide. Distinct cobalt surface concentration regimes were identified, in terms of catalytic activities, and dominant structures for these regimes are associated with specific cluster nuclearities, as determined by spectroscopic methods. The synthetic strategy described here should serve as a useful methodology for evaluations of various catalysts, surface structures, and reaction conditions.


 	Fig. 1  Gas adsorption surface area of CoSBA materials as a function of cobalt loading (top). Loss of surface area with increased loading was comparable to similar systems studied previously. The pore diameter did not change significantly with loading (bottom), indicating that the mesoporous structure of SBA-15 was intact after the grafting procedures.	 

 	Scheme 1  Synthesis of CoSBA materials.	 

 	Fig. 2  XANES (top) and EXAFS (bottom) spectra of selected CoSBA samples. CoSBA-PC denotes CoSBA106 after catalysis cycles. XANES of low loading CoSBA samples exhibited an edge energy suggestive of Co2+. Similar XANES spectra were recorded for CoSBA511 and Co3O4, indicating that cobalt oxide has formed in CoSBA511. The EXAFS spectrum of CoSBA027 displays an excellent fit against the model, supporting the surface structures depicted in Scheme 1.	 

 	Fig. 3  Oxygen evolution of CoSBA catalysts over time (top). An increase in product formation was observed with increasing surface concentration to CoSBA106, with a decrease in the overall product formation transitioning to CoSBA189, suggesting the involvement of a different catalytic species (structure C, Scheme 1). The CoSBA catalysts exhibited recyclability with further additions of oxidant, and catalysis continued for more than 6 hours and 200 turnovers (bottom).	 

 	Fig. 4  TOFi plotted against increasing cobalt loading (top). TOFi values decrease with increasing surface concentration. Examination of the total amount of O2 produced as a function of cobalt loading (bottom) suggests the presence of distinct catalyst loading regimes, which correspond to the predominance of different surfaces species for each concentration range (Scheme 1). The amount of sacrificial oxidant in each experiment (151 μmol) corresponds to a theoretical maximum production of 75 μmol of O2.
