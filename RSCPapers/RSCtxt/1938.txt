    , Accepted 22nd August 2015First published on 25th August 2015AbstractWith the goal of discovering a new and plausible approach to utilizing the conjugated side chains (CSCs), other than for the previously reported purpose of two-dimensional (2D) π-conjugation extension in π-conjugated polymers, we report, for the first time, the impact of with/without interactions induced via resonance in CSCs on the molecular weight (Mw) and photovoltaic performance of polymers. For this, we designed two donor (D)–acceptor (A) polymers, represented as PBDTBPA(H)-DPP and PBDTBPA(F)-DPP, containing alkoxy-BPA(H) and alkoxy-BPA(F) [BPA = biphenylethynyl] on the benzodithiophene (BDT) unit as novel CSCs, respectively. The introduction of these CSCs generated bis-tolane as an integrated part of the BDT unit, which allowed us to address the difference in the polymerization, photophysical, and photovoltaic properties of PBDTBPA(H)-DPP and PBDTBPA(F)-DPP, as a function of the structural variation of CSCs, which has never been investigated in organic solar cells (OSCs). In contrast to the weak electron-donating nature of BPA(H), BPA(F) exhibited a strong electron-donating ability due to the interaction of the lone pair electrons of the fluorine atom with the triple bond via resonance, which decreased the rigidity of the triple bond, whereas in PBDTBPA(H)-DPP the rigidity of the triple bond was retained with no such interaction. The striking differences in the rigidity and different electron-withdrawing tendencies of the CSCs were well correlated with Mw and with the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels of the polymers. As a result, the inverted OSCs based on PBDTBPA(H)-DPP achieved an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.74 V, and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 5.58%, which was 38% higher than that of PBDTBPA(F)-DPP-based inverted OSCs. More significantly, the inverted OSC devices were highly stable, retaining 80% of their original PCE after 60-day storage in air, even without encapsulation. To the best of our knowledge, this 5.58% is the highest PCE reported to date for the arylethynyl-substituted BDT donor-based OSCs. These results reveal that bis-tolane [BDTBPA(H)] as an integrated part of the new BDT unit is a promising donor building block for high Mw donor polymers in addition to 2D extended π-conjugation for high performance bulk heterojunction (BHJ) OSCs.
Introduction
Gaining a complete understanding of the relationship between the chemical structure and photovoltaic properties of π-conjugated polymers is essential for realizing a higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) for organic solar cells (OSCs) based on bulk heterojunction (BHJ) architectures compared to inorganic solar cells. Until now, much research has been devoted to studying the effect of π-conjugated backbone modification on the band gap, molecular ordering, planarity, thermal stability, and photovoltaic performance of the polymers in both OSC and organic field-effect transistor applications through plausible synthetic strategies.1–5
On the other hand, very few studies have examined the important role played by the conjugated side chain (CSC) in terms of extending the conjugation two dimensionally (2D) and thereby improving the absorption and the charge carrier and photovoltaic parameters. The numerous literature reports on 2D π-conjugated polymers based on benzodithiophene (BDT) have revealed that the CSC located at the upward and downward directions of the BDT unit plays a key role in deciding PCE.6,7 Moreover, till now only four major CSC functionalities, namely thiophene,8 selenophene,9 furan,10 and phenyl11 groups, have governed the overall performance of the OSCs based on 2D π-conjugated polymers containing the BDT unit. Regardless of the extraordinary PCE attained, the synthetic complexity involved in further tailoring of these CSCs (aryl/heterocyclic groups) has only confined them as acting as a platform to hold the aliphatic alkyl chains for maintaining the solution processability. In addition, despite the fascinating features of the BDT-based 2D π-conjugated polymers, to the best of our knowledge no successful illustrative report has been published that shows how the subtle variation in the structure of CSCs significantly affects the molecular weight (Mw) and the frontier energy levels of the polymer, which in turn affect the charge carrier and photovoltaic properties. This is because the Mw of the polymer plays an important role in improving the charge carrier mobilities and PCE.12,13 Therefore, the aforementioned issues necessitate further extension of CSCs with versatile utility for enhancing the Mw, modulating the frontier energy levels and improving the photovoltaic performance of the polymers rather than just acting for the purpose of 2D conjugation extension.
In the process of our quest for CSCs with multi-functionalities, we specially designed an alkoxy-biphenylethynyl [BPA(H)] group and its fluorinated analogue alkoxy-difluorobiphenylethynyl [BPA(F)] as novel CSCs on the BDT unit, which are entirely different from the routinely introduced heterocyclic/aryl groups. By this simple chemical modification, the structure of our new 2D conjugated BDT-based monomer units BDTBPA(H) and BDTBPA(F) supports the generation of a new liquid crystal molecule called bis-tolane as an integrated part of BDT in their structures (Fig. 1). Structurally, bis-tolane consists of a phenylethynyl group connected to both sides of a benzene ring and it is classed as one of the high birefringence nematic liquid crystals. Bis-tolane-based liquid crystal compounds have been well researched and are recognized as important components for display applications.14–16 Furthermore, the mesogenic, physical, and chemical properties of these birefringence bis-tolane liquid crystals can be modulated by substitution of hydrogen with fluorine atoms onto the terminal phenyl rings. The dramatic difference in the properties of the liquid crystal compounds with or without fluorine substitution is attributed to the interaction between the lone pair electrons of the fluorine atom and the π-electrons of the triple bond via the resonance effect. Therefore, we envisage that the introduction of such groups as parts of the BDT unit will also significantly affect the degree of polymerization, optical properties, and energy levels of the polymers and also the photovoltaic properties of OSCs containing BDT-based 2D π-conjugated polymers.
 Fig. 1  Schematic image of the design strategy of the novel π-conjugated polymers examined in this work. 
Based on the aforementioned considerations, this study addresses the impact of with/without interactions induced via the resonance effect on the Mw and photovoltaic properties that have never been reported in OSCs. We designed two donor (D)–acceptor (A) polymers named poly[4,8-bis(4′-(2-ethylhexyloxy)-3-ethynylbiphenyl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene]-alt-[2,5-diethylhexl-3,6-bis(5-thiophen-2-yl)pyrrolo[3,4-c]-pyrrole-1,4-dione] (PBDTBPA(H)-DPP) and poly[4,8-bis(4′-(2-ethylhexyloxy)-3-ethynyl-2,4-difluorobiphenyl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene]-alt-[2,5-diethylhexl-3,6-bis(5-thiophen-2-yl)pyrrolo[3,4-c]-pyrrole-1,4-dione] (PBDTBPA(F)-DPP) containing BPA(H) and BPA(F) as novel CSCs, respectively (Scheme 1). The fluorine atoms adjacent to the triple bond in PBDTBPA(F)-DPP increased the electron-donating tendency of BPA(F) and reduced the rigidity of the triple bond by an interaction between the lone pair electrons of the fluorine atom with the π-electrons of the triple bond induced via the resonance effect. As a result, PBDTBPA(F)-DPP exhibited a lower degree of polymerization, inferior charge carrier and photovoltaic properties when compared to PBDTBPA(H)-DPP, in which the triple bond character is sustained due to the absence of interactions prompted through the resonance effect. Consequently, under optimized device fabrication conditions, the inverted OSC (IOSC) devices utilizing the PBDTBPA(H)-DPP:PC71BM blend exhibited a PCE of 5.58%, which is higher than that of the devices based on the PBDTBPA(F)-DPP:PC71BM BHJ composite. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to date demonstrating the high PCE of 5.58% for 2D π-conjugated D–A polymers containing BDT with highly rigid arylethynyl substituents (Table 1). Space charge limited current (SCLC) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements revealed clear correlations of the modified polymer structure via the CSC with the carrier mobility, film morphology, and resulting photovoltaic properties.

Results and discussion
The electron-rich BDT unit was chosen as a building block to build D–A π-conjugated polymers with the DPP unit (2,5-diethylhexyl-3,6-bis(5-bromothien-2-yl)pyrrolo[3,4-c]-pyrrole-1,4-dione) as a strong electron accepting group because the BDT unit can be functionalized at the 4th and 8th positions, which enables fine tuning of the extended 2D conjugation, solution processability, physical, optical, and electronic properties of the resulting polymers. The two CSCs [BPA(H) and BPA(F)] were attached to the central phenyl ring of the BDT unit with ethylhexyl as a solubilizing group. Bis-tolane, thus generated as an integrated part of the BDT unit by incorporation of these CSCs, allowed us to study the structure–property relationships of the polymers since the triple bond is strongly affected by the substituents within its vicinity. Compared to the previously reported monomer units with electron-donating (alkyl or alkoxy) substituents,17 we anticipated that our newly designed BDT monomer units possessing efficient electron delocalization would exhibit overlap of the molecular orbitals, irrespective of the substituents adjacent to the triple bond of CSCs. Scheme 1 outlines the synthetic routes of the two new BDT-based donor monomer units, BDTBPA(H) and BDTBPA(F). BPA(H) and BPA(F) were synthesized via various familiar chemical transformations such as Sonogashira and Suzuki coupling, and deprotection under basic conditions. BPA(H) and BPA(F) were reacted with 4,8-dihydrobenzene[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophen-4,8-dione to generate the corresponding intermediates 3 and 7, which were subsequently reacted to form BDTBPA(H) and BDTBPA(F), respectively. The Stille coupling polymerizations of the DPP unit and two new donor units, BDTBPA(H) and BDTBPA(F), afforded two D–A polymers PBDTBPA(H)-DPP and PBDTBPA(F)-DPP, respectively, as shown in Scheme 2. The synthetic procedures for the monomers and polymers are explained in detail in the Experimental section (ESI†). The chemical structures of the monomers were confirmed by 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy (Fig. S1–S5 in the ESI†). The polymers were characterized by 1H NMR (Fig. S6 in the ESI†) and elemental analysis.

Effect of with/without resonance-mediated interactions in CSCs on the degree of polymerization and Mw
As encountered in many polymer systems the photovoltaic properties of the polymers were substantially effected by their Mw.18,19 Hence, we firstly investigated the effect of with/without resonance-induced interactions in CSCs on the Mw of the polymers. Initially, we performed polymerization in a microwave reactor to synthesize PBDTBPA(H)-DPP and PBDTBPA(F)-DPP under the same reaction conditions (chlorobenzene (CB), 120 °C, and 30 min). Surprisingly, PBDTBPA(F)-DPP exhibited less polymerization than PBDTBPA(H)-DPP did, leading to a low Mw of 24270 g mol−1, even though both polymers contain the rigid triple bond attached to the phenyl group of BDT in both upward and downward directions. Simultaneously, the excessively high Mw of PBDTBPA(H)-DPP afforded an insoluble material that was precipitated out before completion of polymerization under microwave conditions. The difference in Mw and solubility is explained as follows. The triple bond nature in the monomer BDTBPA(H) is not disturbed by the hydrogen's vicinity, making the triple bond more rigid (Fig. 2a). In the monomer BDTBPA(F), however, the triple bond nature is perturbed by the interaction by the lone pair electrons of the fluorine atom, and the resulting partial double bond decreases the rigidity (Fig. 2b). We tried different reaction conditions such as increasing the temperature and time, but failed to increase the Mw for PBDTBPA(F)-DPP. To achieve good solubility for PBDTBPA(H)-DPP, we implemented conventional heating polymerization conditions (120 °C, 6 h) and successfully achieved higher Mw for PBDTBPA(H)-DPP than for PBDTBPA(F)-DPP with better solubility. The difference in the degree of polymerization was well correlated with the Mw [Mw of PBDTBPA(H)-DPP > Mw of PBDTBPA(F)-DPP], as shown via gel permeation chromatography (GPC) analysis (Fig. S7 and S8†). The resulting polymers were cautiously purified through the Soxhlet-extracted method using methanol, acetone, and hexane, to remove the impurities and oligomer fractions. Finally, the polymers were extracted into chloroform (CF). The Mw obtained via GPC analysis was 71320 g mol−1 for PBDTBPA(H)-DPP, which is three times higher than that of PBDTBPA(F)-DPP (Mw of 24270 g mol−1). Undoubtedly, this significant difference in Mw will affect the photovoltaic performance in BHJ OSCs based on polymer/[6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM).20 Thus far, the majority of reports demonstrating the synthesis of polymers with different Mw (ranging from low to high) was conducted only by changing the reaction conditions such as taking an imbalanced ratio of monomers and solvents with various polarities (toluene → CB).12 In a completely different methodology, our design strategy utilizes the structural modification of the CSC as a key factor to decide the resultant Mw of the corresponding polymers.

The thermal properties of PBDTBPA(H)-DPP and PBDTBPA(F)-DPP were investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 (Fig. 3a). The onset of decomposition temperature (Td, corresponding to 5% weight loss) of PBDTBPA(H)-DPP and PBDTBPA(F)-DPP was 412 and 421 °C, respectively, which demonstrates their excellent thermal stability for OSC application.

Optical properties of PBDTBPA(H)-DPP and PBDTBPA(F)-DPP
As mentioned in the above section, the incorporation of BPA(H) or BPA(F) groups on BDT from the upward and downward directions results in the generation of a liquid crystal molecule, i.e., bis-tolane, as an integrated part of the BDT unit. Additionally, the conjugation and polarization of this type of liquid crystal molecule containing bis-tolane derivatives can be significantly enhanced by lateral substitution with fluorine atoms.14 Due to the presence of fluorine atoms in the vicinity of the triple bond, the conjugation is not weakened, even when the rings are twisted. This is because the two π-electron pairs of the triple bond are exactly orthogonal to each other. Moreover, a strong interaction exists between the lone pair electrons of the fluorine atom and the π-electrons of the triple bond. Overall, the conjugation and polarization are stronger in fluorinated bis-tolane derivatives than in non-fluorinated bis-tolane derivatives because the lone pair electrons of the fluorine atom restrict the rotation of the phenyl rings via the resonance effect (Fig. 2b). In this scenario, we assumed that our newly designed polymers PBDTBPA(H)-DPP and PBDTBPA(F)-DPP, which contain typical molecular features of non-fluorinated and fluorinated bis-tolane, respectively, would also show different optical and electrochemical properties.
The optical properties of PBDTBPA(H)-DPP and PBDTBPA(F)-DPP were investigated by recording the UV–visible absorption spectra of PBDTBPA(H)-DPP and PBDTBPA(F)-DPP in a dilute CF solution and in the thin film state, and are shown in Fig. 3b and c. The absorption maxima (λmax) and optical band gaps (Eoptg) are summarized in Table 2. PBDTBPA(H)-DPP and PBDTBPA(F)-DPP showed two distinct features, a π–π* transition at the higher energy region and an intramolecular charge transfer transition at the lower energy region, which is a typical feature of D–A π-conjugated polymers. The UV–visible spectrum of PBDTBPA(F)-DPP (λonset = 961 nm) showed a red shift by 69 nm compared to that of PBDTBPA(H)-DPP (λonset = 892 nm) in the film states due to the enhanced 2D conjugation induced by the interaction between the lone pair electrons of the fluorine atom and the triple bond in PBDTBPA(F)-DPP. Although this type of interaction was absent in PBDTBPA(H)-DPP due to the absence of lone pair electrons in the hydrogen atom, in turn the CSC core exhibited free rotation which ultimately weakened the conjugation (Fig. 2a). The Eoptg of the polymers calculated from the absorption edges was 1.39 eV for PBDTBPA(H)-DPP and 1.29 eV for PBDTBPA(F)-DPP, relatively smaller than the Eoptg values of 1.44 and 1.46 eV for PBDTT-DPP and PBDTP-DPP, respectively,21 and 1.44 eV for PBDTF-DPP,10a indicating that PBDTBPA(H)-DPP and PBDTBPA(F)-DPP have more 2D conjugation in the upward and downward directions than the above mentioned similarly structured polymers but differ in the CSC groups. This is due to the highly conjugated extendable BPA units as CSC groups in the PBDTBPA(H or F)-DPP framework. In the film state, the two polymers display slightly broader spectra that are even further bathochromically shifted compared with those in solution. In contrast to the 3 nm red shift for PBDTBPA(H)-DPP, the thin film spectrum of PBDTBPA(F)-DPP showed a red shift of around 31 nm, indicating that PBDTBPA(F)-DPP possesses a stronger interaction between the polymer chains than does PBDTBPA(H)-DPP in the film state. Even though the Eoptg of PBDTBPA(H)-DPP was 0.1 eV higher than that of PBDTBPA(F)-DPP, the overall spectral coverage of both polymers in the UV–visible spectra demonstrated their potential for use as highly promising candidates for the fabrication of high performance tandem OSCs.

Electrochemical properties of PBDTBPA(H)-DPP and PBDTBPA(F)-DPP
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed to evaluate the electronic energy levels of the polymers (Fig. S9† and Table 2). As shown in Fig. 3d, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels of PBDTBPA(H)-DPP and PBDTBPA(F)-DPP were estimated to be −5.25 and −5.20 eV, respectively. As shown in Fig. 2b, due to the reduction of the triple bond to the double bond by the interaction between the lone pair electrons of the fluorine atom and the triple bond via the resonance effect, the fluorinated CSC [BPA(F)] behaved as a strong electron-donating group in PBDTBPA(F)-DPP. In contrast, the triple bond nature of the non-fluorinated CSC [BPA(H)] remained intact because the absence of such an interaction made it weaker as an electron-donating group than its fluorinated counterpart. Thus, when BPA(F) was replaced by BPA(H), the HOMO of the polymers was shifted to slightly deeper levels and were anticipated to attain high Voc for the OSCs that contain BPA(H) as the CSC. For example, the HOMO of PBDTBPA(H)-DPP was 0.05 eV lower than that of PBDTBPA(F)-DPP. The lower HOMO of the 2D π-conjugated BDT polymers should be favorable for a higher Voc value for the OSCs, since the Voc of the OSCs is interrelated to the difference between the energy levels of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the PC71BM and the HOMO of the polymers.22 Simultaneously, the LUMO levels for PBDTBPA(H)-DPP and PBDTBPA(F)-DPP were calculated from the HOMO levels attained from the CV analysis and the Eoptg (ELUMO = EHOMO + Eoptg). Accordingly, the LUMO levels were −3.86 and −3.91 eV for PBDTBPA(H)-DPP and PBDTBPA(F)-DPP, respectively.
Investigation of the photovoltaic properties of PBDTBPA(H)-DPP and PBDTBPA(F)-DPP
To understand the importance of the impact of with/without resonance-mediated interactions in CSCs on the PCE, the corresponding photovoltaic devices were examined by fabricating BHJ OSCs with an inverted device architecture of ITO/ZnO/polymer:PC71BM/PEDOT:PSS/Ag by using PBDTBPA(H)-DPP and PBDTBPA(F)-DPP as the electron donor materials and PC71BM as the standard electron acceptor material.23a Due to the strong ability to absorb more light in the visible range, PC71BM was selected as the electron acceptor material as an alternative to PC61BM. The device optimization process contained a careful adjustment of the blend ratios ranging from 1:0.7 to 1:2 in CB and the solvent additives.23b Finally, the ratio and solvent system for both polymers were optimized at 1:1.5 and CB + 3% 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO), respectively. For further improving the PCE, we implemented the methanol treatment method as a part of our device process. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of pristine polymer:PC71BM devices at different ratios are shown in Fig. S10a and S10b† and the related data are shown in Table S1.† The J–V curves of pristine polymer:PC71BM devices with 3% DIO and methanol treatment at the blend ratio of 1:1.5 are presented in Fig. 4a and b and the detailed data are collected in Tables 3 and 4. The devices using PBDTBPA(H)-DPP processed from CB + 3% DIO exhibited the highest PCE of 4.62% with a large Voc of 0.73 V, the short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 12.36 mA cm−2 and the fill factor (FF) of 51.21%. In contrast, under the same processing conditions, the device using PBDTBPA(F)-DPP exhibited a low PCE of 3.04% with a Voc of 0.68 V, Jsc of 9.49 mA cm−2, and FF of 46.99%. From these photovoltaic characteristics, we inferred that the IOSCs based on the PBDTBPA(F)-DPP containing fluorine atoms in the CSC exhibited inferior photovoltaic properties to those of the IOSCs based on PBDTBPA(H)-DPP containing non-fluorine atoms in the CSC.

We next examined the correlation between structural modification and the photovoltaic properties of the IOSC devices based on PBDTBPA(H)-DPP and PBDTBPA(F)-DPP. The interaction between the lone pair electrons of the fluorine atom and the triple bond in the CSC is solely responsible for the decreased Voc, Jsc, and FF of the PBDTBPA(F)-DPP-based IOSCs compared to those of PBDTBPA(H)-DPP. Compared to PBDTBPA(F)-DPP with Voc of 0.68 V, PBDTBPA(H)-DPP showed a substantially improved Voc of 0.74 V, which was attributed to the well-maintained triple bond nature in PBDTBPA(H)-DPP due to the presence of hydrogen atoms with no lone pair electrons to interact with the triple bond via resonance. For PBDTBPA(F)-DPP, the triple bond nature is perturbed by the interaction of the lone pair electrons of the fluorine atom acquiring a partial double bond character (Fig. 2b). Consequently, the HOMO level of PBDTBPA(H)-DPP is deepened compared to that of PBDTBPA(F)-DPP due to the restored electron-withdrawing nature of the triple bond in PBDTBPA(H)-DPP.
The Eoptg values of PBDTBPA(H)-DPP and PBDTBPA(F)-DPP suggest that PBDTBPA(F)-DPP-based devices should provide higher photocurrent densities than PBDTBPA(H)-DPP-based devices, since the Eoptg of PBDTBPA(F)-DPP was smaller than that of PBDTBPA(H)-DPP. Surprisingly, however, the Jsc of the PBDTBPA(H)-DPP-based IOSCs was significantly higher than that of PBDTBPA(F)-DPP. The improved Jsc for PBDTBPA(H)-DPP (12.36 mA cm−2) compared to that of PBDTBPA(F)-DPP (9.49 mA cm−2) was correlated to the Mw of the polymers [Mw of PBDTBPA(H)-DPP > Mw of PBDTBPA(F)-DPP]. The higher Mw of PBDTBPA(H)-DPP compared to that of PBDTBPA(F)-DPP has already been explained from a structural point of view in the earlier section. In line with the earlier reports, the high Mw of PBDTBPA(H)-DPP accounts for the enhanced Jsc of the corresponding PBDTBPA(H)-DPP-based IOSCs. Tables 3 and 4 show that FF also steadily increased in parallel to the trends for Voc and Jsc for PBDTBPA(H)-DPP-based devices, possibly due to increased mobility (vide infra in the next sections), which decreases the charge recombination.24
The PCE of PBDTBPA(H)-DPP and PBDTBPA(F)-DPP-based IOSCs was further enhanced by post-deposition polar solvent treatment.25–28 Encouragingly, after treating the photoactive layer with methanol, the BHJ composites of PBDTBPA(H)-DPP and PBDTBPA(F)-DPP efficiently reciprocated the methanol treatment, and the PCEs of all IOSCs were dramatically enhanced to 5.58 and 4.04% for the IOSCs based on PBDTBPA(H)-DPP and PBDTBPA(F)-DPP, respectively. The highest efficiency of 5.58%, with a Voc of 0.74 V, Jsc of 13.17 mA cm−2, and FF of 57.28%, was obtained from the IOSCs based on PBDTBPA(H)-DPP. This efficiency enhancement attained by simple methanol treatment suggests the possibility of further improving the PCE with the electrode and active layer interface engineering by several proposed strategies.13 However, even after methanol treatment, the photovoltaic properties of PBDTBPA(H)-DPP-based devices were superior to those of PBDTBPA(F)-DPP. We attributed the enhanced PCE for PBDTBPA(H)-DPP upon methanol treatment to its high Mw compared to PBDTBPA(F)-DPP. Furthermore, the PCE of 5.58% is the highest value ever reported for polymers containing BDT with arylethynyl substituents.29–31
The PCE data demonstrated the effectiveness, in comparison with other research reports, of our molecular design strategy of introducing bis-tolane as an integrated part of the BDT unit.7,8 These literature reports disclosed that the opto-electronic, photovoltaic, and morphological properties of the polymers entirely depend on the dihedral angles between the BDT unit and CSCs. However, according to hybrid orbital theory, the electron-donating tendency of the triple bond is weak when compared to the frequently used aryl/heterocyclic groups, which is beneficial for maintaining deeper HOMO levels for higher Voc. In addition, the triple bond possesses high rigidity compared to the aryl/heterocyclic substituents, which allows the polymers to obtain a higher Mw that is advantageous for a higher charge carrier mobility and appropriate phase separation in BHJ devices. Although highly respectable PCE was achieved in the case of aryl/heterocyclic substituted BDT donor-based OSCs, the design approach of the polymers was confined to merely changing the aliphatic side chains on them due to the synthetic complexity for further structural modification.32 In contrast, our molecular design undoubtedly differs from the other reported strategies in terms of the introduction of CSCs [BPA(H) or BPA(F)] on the BDT unit, as the CSC groups serve not only to extend the conjugation in vertical directions, but also to offer further gains in the development of high Mw polymers. With regards to the synthetic flexibility of the triple bond, it is possible to produce a variety of CSCs for introduction on the BDT unit for further expansion of efficient 2D π-conjugated polymers with high Mw. Overall, the elegant molecular design and device fabrication methodologies presented herein enabled us to attain a high PCE of 5.58%, which has never been reported elsewhere for polymers containing a highly rigid triple bond as the CSC on the BDT unit.
To further increase the relative efficiency of the IOSCs based on PBDTBPA(H)-DPP compared to those based on PBDTBPA(F)-DPP, the external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of the IOSCs were measured and compared. Fig. 4c, d and S10c, S10d† present the EQE curves of the IOSCs based on PBDTBPA(H)-DPP and PBDTBPA(F)-DPP under different processing conditions. The EQE ranged from 350 to 950 nm, which is in good agreement with the absorption spectra of PBDTBPA(H)-DPP and PBDTBPA(F)-DPP (Fig. 3c). Interestingly, after treating the photoactive layer with methanol, EQE was considerably increased for the IOSCs based on PBDTBPA(H)-DPP and PBDTBPA(F)-DPP, which was consistent with the photocurrent values. However, an increased EQE from the IOSCs based on PBDTBPA(H)-DPP raised the expectation for a high hole mobility and appropriate BHJ phase separation for PBDTBPA(H)-DPP, which can assist in increasing the Jsc and FF. The Jsc values calculated from the integration of the EQE spectra were matched well with Jsc obtained from the J–V measurements, considering the common error of 5–10% (Tables 3 and 4). Overall, the EQE of the IOSCs based on PBDTBPA(H)-DPP (Fig. 3b) was in good compliance with the enhanced Jsc and FF as the EQE increased compared to the IOSCs based on PBDTBPA(F)-DPP. As shown in Fig. S11,† the dark current J–V curves of the IOSCs based on both PBDTBPA(H)-DPP and PBDTBPA(F)-DPP with methanol treatment exhibited a high Rsh and a low Rs compared to the case without methanol treatment. For instance, the Rsh values were calculated to be 7.65 × 105 Ω cm2 and 3.2 × 105 Ω cm2 for with and without methanol-treated IOSCs based on PBDTBPA(H)-DPP, respectively. Moreover, the Rs of the methanol-treated IOSCs was 4.10 ± 0.36 Ω cm2, which was lower than that of the pristine IOSCs (7.31 ± 0.15 Ω cm2). This result supports the promise of reduced leakage current and better charge collection efficiency due to the high rectification ratio (higher Rsh and low Rs).33
Morphological studies
To investigate the correlation between the enhanced Mwvia structural modification of CSCs and the morphological features in the polymer thin films, we implemented tapping mode AFM to investigate the morphologies of the polymer:PC71BM thin films. The thin film morphologies of PBDTBPA(H)-DPP:PC71BM and PBDTBPA(F)-DPP:PC71BM BHJ composites under optimized and methanol-treated conditions are shown in Fig. 5a, c and 5b, d, respectively. PBDTBPA(H)-DPP exhibited a relatively good film forming ability with a root-mean-square (RMS) surface roughness of 6.1 nm, compared to 6.9 nm for PBDTBPA(F)-DPP in their pristine blend films (Fig. S12†). Furthermore, a smooth film morphology was observed from the AFM height images of PBDTBPA(H)-DPP:PC71BM in the presence of 3% DIO and methanol treatment. This smooth morphology is beneficial for charge separation and transport within the BHJ composite, which leads to higher Jsc due to a larger interface area between PBDTBPA(H)-DPP and PC71BM domains. However, the AFM images of the PBDTBPA(F)-DPP:PC71BM-based films in 3% DIO and under methanol treatment conditions indicated the non-uniform morphological conditions with the increased RMS roughness compared to the PBDTBPA(F)-DPP:PC71BM-based devices. The large phase separation afforded an aggregated morphology for the PBDTBPA(F)-DPP:PC71BM composite, which in turn created an unfavorable condition for efficient exciton dissociation, leading to lower Jsc. We also observed the Mw-dependent morphology adjustment for our BHJ IOSC film composites, which is in agreement with the previous reports.24 Upon methanol treatment, the PBDTBPA(H)-DPP:PC71BM BHJ composite showed improved morphological characteristics (RMS = 1.5 nm) compared to the PBDTBPA(F)-DPP:PC71BM BHJ composite (RMS = 3.2 nm), which revealed the smoother morphology obtained in the former BHJ composite.
 Fig. 5  AFM images of (a) PBDTBPA(H)-DPP:PC71BM (1:1.5) + 3% DIO, (b) PBDTBPA(F)-DPP:PC71BM (1:1.5) + 3% DIO, (c) PBDTBPA(H)-DPP:PC71BM (1:1.5) + 3% DIO (methanol), and (d) PBDTBPA(F)-DPP:PC71BM (1:1.5) + 3% DIO (methanol). 
Correlating the AFM images to the device data implies that PBDTBPA(F)-DPP with the fluorinated CSC unit produces a large phase separation from the BHJ composites, inducing less efficient charge carrier transport and thus delivering low Jsc, whereas the morphology of PBDTBPA(H)-DPP-based IOSC devices affords a better morphological feature and provides more charge carriers.
X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed to examine the crystalline properties of thin films of PBDTBPA(H)-DPP and PBDTBPA(F)-DPP. From the XRD patterns of the polymers casted from CF shown in Fig. S13,† weak diffraction peaks for π–π stacking of the polymers can be noticed. PBDTBPA(F)-DPP shows a peak at 2θ = 22.4°, corresponding to a π–π stacking d-spacing of 3.96 Å; but the PBDTBPA(H)-DPP films show diffraction peaks at ca. 20.9°, which are corresponded to a d-spacing of 4.25 Å. As per the XRD results, PBDTBPA(F)-DPP shows more strong π–π stacking than PBDTBPA(H)-DPP. The results of XRD are well correlated with the morphological studies (mentioned above), and relatively large aggregates are formed in the PBDTBPA(F)-DPP:PC71BM blend compared to the PBDTBPA(H)-DPP:PC71BM blend, which can be attributed to the strong interchain π–π stacking effect of PBDTBPA(F).6 Therefore, a higher charge carrier mobility is anticipated from the IOSCs based on PBDTBPA(H)-DPP compared to those based on PBDTBPA(F)-DPP.
Effect of Mw on the charge carrier mobility
To gain further insight into the influence of Mw on the enhanced Jsc, FF and PCE, the charge transport properties were investigated using the SCLC model. Before investigating the effect of Mw on the hole mobility (μh) of the BHJ composites, we primarily measured and compared the μh of the bare polymers (Fig. S14†) with the configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer/MoO3/Al. The SCLC study revealed that PBDTBPA(H)-DPP displayed an increased μh of 3.84 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 (Mw = 71320 g mol−1), which was 2.5-fold higher than that of PBDTBPA(F)-DPP with a μh of 1.53 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 (Mw = 24270 g mol−1). This is in good agreement with the previous reports on the correlation between Mw and μh.12,24,34 The enhanced μh for PBDTBPA(H)-DPP probably originated from the higher Mw, as determined from the GPC study, due to the preserved rigidity of the triple bond resulting from the absence of the interactions induced via the resonance effect (Fig. 2a). We also measured the hole-only (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM/PEDOT:PSS/Ag) and electron-only (ITO/ZnO/polymer:PC71BM/LiF/Al) mobilities of the BHJ composites using the SCLC model, and the J–V characteristics are plotted in Fig. 6. The related data are summarized in Table S2.† The calculated μh for the PBDTBPA(H)-DPP:PC71BM device (6.55 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1) was double that of the PBDTBPA(F)-DPP:PC71BM device (3.37 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1), which we attributed to the better percolation pathways (an ordered network of PBDTBPA(H)-DPP chains) induced via the better morphological conditions obtained in the PBDTBPA(H)-DPP-based BHJ composite, which improved the charge transportation throughout the device. The calculated electron mobilities (μe, cm2 V−1 s−1) were nearly identical (Table S2†), despite the large variation between the μh of the IOSC devices based on PBDTBPA(H)-DPP and PBDTBPA(F)-DPP. Consequently, the mobility ratio (μh/μe) was highest in the PBDTBPA(H)-DPP:PC71BM BHJ composite. Therefore, the efficient charge transport in the PBDTBPA(H)-DPP-based BHJ composite was attributed to the increased mobility ratio, which reduced the number of space charges in the IOSC device based on PBDTBPA(H)-DPP.35 The same hole mobility trend was observed even after methanol treatment, which confirmed the superiority of PBDTBPA(H)-DPP over PBDTBPA(F)-DPP as a polymer. Overall, the charge carrier studies revealed that achieving a high Mw for the polymers is a prerequisite for acquiring a high Jsc for the corresponding IOSC devices. In this case, our design strategy of introducing BPA(H) as the CSC on the BDT unit for maintaining the rigidity of the triple bond was highly advantageous for increasing the Mw, as was well demonstrated by the SCLC study results.

Impedance study
To further support the phenomenon of PCE improvement of the IOSCs based on PBDTBPA(H)-DPP and PBDTBPA(F)-DPP after methanol treatment, electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed to investigate the detailed electrical properties of IOSCs, which could not be examined by direct current measurements. The internal resistance of the IOSCs measured via EIS is composed of the sheet resistance (Rsh) of the electrodes, and the charge-transport resistance (RCT) at the photoactive layer/electrode interfaces and inside the photoactive layer. In the case of with and without methanol treatment conditions, the Rsh of all IOSCs was the same for both the ZnO/ITO cathode and the Ag anode for the IOSC devices based on PBDTBPA(H)-DPP and PBDTBPA(F)-DPP. Thus the variation in the internal resistance of the whole device originated from inside the photoactive layers, which were processed from methanol treatment. Fig. S15† shows the Nyquist plot of all IOSCs, both with and without methanol treatment. The EIS analysis revealed that the internal resistance of the IOSCs based on PBDTBPA(H)-DPP using methanol treatment was ca. 54 Ω, which was much smaller than the value of ca. 159 Ω for the IOSCs without methanol treatment. These data suggested that methanol treatment can improve the contact between the photoactive layer and the top Ag electrode and, consequently, facilitate the charge transport in IOSCs, resulting in high Jsc, FF, and PCE. This indicates that simple post solvent treatment methods such as methanol treatment could be effective and affordable in fabricating outstanding OSCs when compared to other more burdensome device processing techniques. Further, the Nyquist plots also clearly revealed a significant reduction in resistance of the IOSC devices based on PBDTBPA(H)-DPP compared to PBDTBPA(F)-DPP, which was well correlated with the enhanced Jsc and FF for PBDTBPA(H)-DPP.
Investigation of IOSC stability
Along with other photovoltaic parameters, stability is a very important factor in the commercial application of OSCs. With this objective, we investigated the stability of the IOSCs in terms of PCE for a period of 60 days. As shown in Fig. 7, the IOSCs primarily displayed good performance with a PCE of 5.58 and 4.00% for PBDTBPA(H)-DPP and PBDTBPA(F)-DPP, respectively. After 60-day storage under ambient conditions, the devices still exhibited a high PCE of 4.65 and 3.20%, respectively, which equated to a retention of 80% of their highest efficiency. The better stability of the IOSCs based on PBDTBPA(H)-DPP and PBDTBPA(F)-DPP supports our study for recommendation of these polymers with bis-tolane as an integrated part of the BDT unit as a promising material for large scale OSC application. Their stability can be further improved if the devices are well encapsulated.

Conclusions
To examine the impact of with/without resonance-mediated interactions in CSCs, PBDTBPA(H)-DPP and PBDTBPA(F)-DPP, two polymers with bis-tolane as an integrated part of the BDT unit, were designed and synthesized with different CSC groups [BPA(H) and BPA(F), respectively] incorporated on the BDT unit. These two novel CSCs, with [BPA(F)] and without [BPA(H)] fluorine atoms adjacent to the triple bond on the BDT unit, offered the opportunity to modify the polymerization, optical, electrochemical, charge carrier, and photovoltaic properties of the polymers. PBDTBPA(F)-DPP with the fluorinated CSC [BPA(F)] displayed weaker triple bond rigidity than PBDTBPA(H)-DPP with the non-fluorinated CSC [BPA(H)], which significantly affected the degree of polymerization [Mw of PBDTBPA(H)-DPP > Mw of PBDTBPA(F)-DPP]. The decreased rigidity of the triple bond in the CSC with fluorine atoms was due to an interaction induced between the lone pair electrons of the fluorine atom and the triple bond via the resonance effect. In contrast to the strong electron-withdrawing tendency of the non-fluorinated CSC of PBDTBPA(H)-DPP, PBDTBPA(F)-DPP substituted with the fluorinated CSC possessed a strong electron-donating tendency. As a result, the HOMO of PBDTBPA(H)-DPP was deepened, resulting in a high Voc of 0.74 V for the IOSCs based on PBDTBPA(H)-DPP, compared to 0.68 V for PBDTBPA(F)-DPP. Furthermore the μh, PCE and morphology of the IOSCs based on PBDTBPA(H)-DPP and PBDTBPA(F)-DPP strongly correlated with their Mw. The PCE of 5.58% for PBDTBPA(H)-DPP is the highest value reported to date for arylethynyl substituted BDT-based polymers with a simple inverted device structure and high device stability. Moreover, the high stability of the IOSCs was proved by their ability to maintain 80% of their maximum PCE after 60 days of air storage under unencapsulated conditions. Therefore, bis-tolane as an integrated part of the BDT unit has great potential for application as a novel electron-rich building block, not only for extending the conjugation in vertical directions but also for realizing high polymers. The PCE of the D–A polymers containing bis-tolane [BDTBPA(H)] as an integrated part of the BDT unit can be further improved by polymerizing with different electron deficient units, which offers scope to increase the Voc, Jsc, FF further, in addition to the use of various device fabrication methods such as incorporating buffer layers into the device to improve the interfacial features that are currently under investigation in our laboratory. Therefore, this study has increased our understanding of the molecular design of high Mw polymers by means of new CSCs along with 2D conjugation extension for efficient large-area OSCs.
