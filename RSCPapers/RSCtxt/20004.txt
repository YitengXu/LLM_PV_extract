    , Accepted 5th November 2019First published on 5th November 2019AbstractThe demand for battery-type materials having hierarchical architectures, large surface areas, and excellent redox properties, to develop high energy density asymmetric supercapacitors (ASCs), is increasing. Herein, a facile single-step wet chemical method is proposed, which allows an engineered combination of α-NiMoO4 hierarchical heterostructures to be used as advanced battery-type electrodes for ASCs. The as-synthesized architectures consist of versatile nanogeometries including nanowires, nanosheets, and nanoparticles in the form of Rhynchostylis retusa-like heterostructures, which synergistically enhance the energy storage properties; specifically, at a current density of 2 A g−1, heterostructured α-NiMoO4 exhibits a superior specific capacitance of 1061 F g−1 and an outstanding cycling stability of 96%. Moreover, an aqueous ASC is fabricated by combining such a redox-type α-NiMoO4 heterostructure and activated porous carbon as the positive and negative electrodes, respectively, separated with a piece of filter paper. This device shows high energy and power densities (31.8 W h kg−1 and 786.5 W kg−1, respectively), which are useful to operate various portable electronic appliances. Together with the excellent cycling stability and energy storage properties, the synthesized heterostructured metal molybdates exemplify a new approach to develop novel electrode materials for high-performance aqueous ASCs.
1. Introduction
The ever-increasing global warming issues, the rapid depletion of fossil fuels, and the urgent pursuit of sustainable energy have collectively pushed researchers to develop eco-friendly and high-performance energy storage systems.1–4 Energy storage technologies such as lithium-ion batteries and supercapacitors (SCs) have been extensively used as essential components in various electronic devices and hybrid electric vehicles.5–7 In particular, SCs have attracted great interest due to their outstanding features of eco-sustainability, rapid charge/discharge, high power density, and cycling durability;8–10 however, low energy density is their main disadvantage, limiting their applicability.11,12 Therefore, intense research efforts have been dedicated to enhancing the energy density of SCs without loss of their power density.13 The energy density is directly related to the capacity and potential window of the cell.14 The capacity can be increased by designing novel battery/redox-type materials, while a high potential window can be achieved by fabricating asymmetric SCs (ASCs) with various capacitive-type electrode materials.15,16 This configuration could efficiently enhance the energy storage performance of ASCs by utilizing their intriguing features.17
A major contribution in enhancing the energy storage is largely dependent on the morphologies of the nanomaterials and physicochemical properties of electrode materials.13,18 As a consequence, the rational design of electrode materials having improved electrochemical properties has recently attracted great attention.19,20 To date, these materials have been mainly realized in two different geometries: solitary morphologies (e.g., nanoparticles (NPs), nanowires (NWs), nanosheets (NSs), and nanoflowers) and hierarchical architectures (e.g., core–shell, hybrid and multicomponent materials).21–24 Among them, hierarchical architectures with hybrid nanocomposites provide superior electrochemical performance in terms of capacity, rate capability, and cycling stability.25,26 This is due to synergistic effects that provide numerous paths for efficient electrolyte interaction and reduce the ionic diffusion distance towards the electroactive sites of the material, resulting in improved redox reactions and faster charge transportation.19,27,28 Given these advantages, various battery-type materials (metal oxides, molybdates, and sulfides) with core–shell and multicomponent morphologies have been widely investigated to improve the redox properties and the capacity of ASCs.29,30
Metal molybdates such as NiMoO4, CoMoO4, and Cu3Mo2O9 have attracted significant interest as electrode materials for ASCs. Their intercalated anions (i.e. MoO42−) offer better electric conductivity compared to metal hydroxides and sulfides.22,23,31 Moreover, the versatile oxidation states, the great redox reversibility and eco-friendly nature make them optimal candidates for high-performance devices.25 Among the various metal molybdates, NiMoO4 offers better prospects for both electrocatalysis and electrochemical energy harvesting applications because the Ni ions exhibit good electrochemical behavior and the Mo ions have good electrical conductivity, resulting in superior electrochemical features.32–34 Besides, NiMoO4 exhibits different polymorphs, among which α-NiMoO4 and β-NiMoO4 have drawn much interest due to their specific lattice arrangement and mechanochemical effect.35 Several studies have explored the design of NiMoO4-based high performance ASCs with different combinations of hierarchical/core–shell-like metal molybdates and carbonaceous materials as redox-type and negative electrodes, respectively.36,37 For example, Liu et al.38 synthesized CoMoO4–NiMoO4·xH2O composite nanobundles via two-step assisted hydrothermal methods for ASC applications. In another study, Yang et al. obtained three-dimensional CoMoO4@NiMoO4 core–shell nanotube arrays by using a two-step hydrothermal method followed by thermal treatment.39 Guo et al. rationally designed and hydrothermally synthesized MoO3/NiMoO4 core–shell nanobelts as a redox material for high-performance ASCs.40 Although these studies demonstrated the superior electrochemical performance of such materials, they used multi-step, high-temperature and complicated growth methods. To reduce the fabrication costs, the presence of sophisticated instruments, and the growth time, novel single-step and low-temperature growth methods for multicomponent and core–shell-like metal molybdate nanoarchitectures must be developed. Moreover, the realization of large-scale nanostructures having high surface area and porosity via simple methods is still a significant challenge for the development of high-performance SCs.
In this work, we have successfully designed and engineered a combination of heterostructured α-NiMoO4 hierarchical architectures (NWs, NSs and NPs) through a facile single-step wet-chemical method at low growth temperature. The inclusion of tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPAOH) in the nickel and molybdenum precursors had a significant effect on the rational combination of NWs + NSs + NPs in the final α-NiMoO4 heterostructures. Due to the synergetic benefits, including high electrochemical activity and large accessible surface area, the α-NiMoO4 heterostructures (NWs + NSs + NPs) exhibited excellent redox properties and superior energy storage performance in an aqueous electrolyte, enabling their application as an SC electrode for the fabrication of ASCs. For validation, a pouch-type ASC was fabricated using these heterostructured α-NiMoO4 NWs + NSs + NPs as a battery-type positive electrode, activated porous carbon (APC) as the negative electrode, filter paper as the separator, and aqueous alkaline electrolyte. The fabricated device showed very high energy and power densities along with outstanding cycling durability and rate capability. Moreover, a self-powered rechargeable ASC comprising a renewable energy harvester was also assembled, demonstrating the suitability of such a device for various portable electronic applications.
2. Experimental details
2.1. Synthesis of heterostructured α-NiMoO4 nanoarchitectures
α-NiMoO4 hierarchical architectures were synthesized via a simple wet-chemical approach by using high-purity nickel nitrate hexahydrate (Ni(NO3)2·6H2O), carbamide (NH2CONH2), ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate ((NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O, 81–83% MoO3 basis), TPAOH (C12H29NO) solution (1 M in H2O), NH4OH solution (28–30% NH basis) and de-ionized (DI) water. The concentrations of the solutes were calculated for 100 ml of solvent. Solution I was made by dissolving 10 mmol of (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O and 30 mmol of NH4OH in 20 ml of DI water, while solution II was prepared with 70 mmol of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O and 0.5 mol of CO(NH2)2 in 80 ml of DI water; both solutions were magnetically stirred for 1 h. They were mixed by adding solution I dropwise to solution II under constant magnetic stirring. Then, the desired amount of TPAOH was added. The resulting green-colored solution was stirred for 2 h for homogeneity. The homogeneous solution was then placed in a silicone oil bath and the oil bath was heated to 90 °C and held at this temperature for 10 h. After completion of the reaction, the pale yellow-colored precipitate was separated from the solution by centrifugation at 8000 rpm for 6 min, washed several times with DI water and ethanol, and subsequently dried at 80 °C for 12 h under ambient conditions. To obtain the α-NiMoO4, the dried precursor was then calcined in N2 atmosphere at 450 °C for 3 h.
2.2. Characterization
The morphological properties of the prepared samples were examined by using a high-resolution scanning electron microscopy (HRSEM) system (Hitachi-SU8010, Japan) and a field-emission transmission electron microscopy (FETEM) apparatus (JEOL, JEM 2100F, Japan) equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectrometer. Their crystallinity and functional groups were characterized with an X-ray diffraction (XRD) system (X-pert Powder Diffractometer, Pro MRD, PANalytical, The Netherlands). Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was performed on a JASCO FT/IR-6600 Spectrometer (Japan). The surface chemical composition and oxidation states of the NiMoO4 samples were investigated by using an X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) apparatus (K-Alpha, Thermo Scientific, USA). The N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms of the samples were measured with a Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface analyzer (Tristar, ASAP 2020, Micromeritics, USA).
2.3. Electrochemical analyses
An electrochemical workstation (PGSTAT302N, Metrohm Autolab, The Netherlands) was used to perform room temperature potentiostatic cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD), and potentiostatic electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements. The EIS analysis was conducted in the frequency range between 0.01 Hz and 100 kHz, at 5 mV. The analyzed three-electrode system consisted of α-NiMoO4-coated Ni foam (1 × 1 cm2), a platinum sheet, and a Ag/AgCl electrode as the working, counter, and reference electrodes, respectively, immersed in a 1 M KOH electrolyte solution contained in a conventional beaker-type vessel. The working electrodes were prepared via a slurry casting approach: the α-NiMoO4 nanostructures were mixed with polyvinylidene fluoride and carbon black (Super P), as the binders, in a weight ratio of 80:10:10, respectively, and N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone was used as the supporting solvent. The obtained slurry was coated on Ni foam and dried at 80 °C in a vacuum oven for 10 h. The mass loading of the α-NiMoO4 active material on Ni foam was determined to be about 2.5 to 2.8 mg cm−2. The specific capacitance (Csp) of the various α-NiMoO4 samples having different morphologies was calculated as follows:41,42 (1)where I is the applied current, Δt is the discharge time, m is the mass of the active material within the active area, and ΔV is the potential window.
2.4. Fabrication of a pouch-type two-electrode ASC
A pouch-type two-electrode ASC was fabricated using Ni foam coated with, respectively, heterostructured α-NiMoO4 NWs + NSs + NPs and capacitive-type APC as the positive (cathode) and negative (anode) electrodes, with a few drops of 1 M KOH as the electrolyte. To avoid a short circuit, the electrodes were separated with a piece of Whatman filter paper. This sandwich-structured device was packed with an aluminum laminated film and carefully sealed with a heat sealer.
3. Results and discussion
To synthesize NiMoO4, monomeric MoO42− oxyanions were first separated from ammonium heptamolybdate by adding NH3·H2O as follows:(NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O + 3NH3·H2O + 2H2O → Mo7O246− + 9NH4OH + 3H2Mo7O246− + 8NH4OH → 7MoO42− + 8NH4+ + 4H2O
Then, these monomers reacted with Ni2+ ions as follows:  
α-NiMoO4 NWs, α-NiMoO4 NWs + NSs, and the novel combination α-NiMoO4 NWs + NSs + NPs were prepared via a facile wet chemical method by adding carbamide and TPAOH as precipitating and structure-directing agents (Fig. 1a); this addition is key to determining the desired morphologies of α-NiMoO4. The experiment was conducted with the addition of 0.5 M carbamide (carbamide/metal ion ratio = 6.25) at 90 °C for 10 h, which produced NH4Ni2Mo2O8(OH)·H2O NWs, followed by calcination at 450 °C for 3 h in N2 atmosphere that gave α-NiMoO4 NWs (Fig. 1b). The reaction between carbamide and NiMoO4·H2O during this process was as follows:

Above 83 °C, carbamide acts as a precipitating agent by gently decomposing into NH4+, OH− and HCO3− in DI water.43 Wang et al.44 reported that the slow decomposition of carbamide in the reaction process, which depends on the reaction temperature and time, can separate the nucleation and crystal growth processes and allow adequate growth on every crystal face, resulting in the formation of nanorods/nanowires. Moreover, they obtained aluminum hydroxide rods and ammonium aluminum carbonate hydroxide rods when the carbamide/metal ion ratio was, respectively, below 7 and above 11. Ratha et al. were able to synthesize NiMoO4·xH2O nanorods without adding carbamide via hydrothermal treatment at 200 °C for 12 h. In the present study, ammonium nickel molybdate hydroxide hydrate NWs were obtained by using a carbamide/metal ion ratio of about 6.25, indicating that, at 90 °C, CO(NH2)2 can produce higher amounts of NH4+ and OH− to react with NiMoO4·H2O and satisfies the reaction requirements to form NH4Ni2Mo2O8(OH)H2O. As shown in Fig. 1b, the resulting NW structure was stable even after calcination at 450 °C, which turned NH4Ni2Mo2O8(OH)H2O into α-NiMoO4, suggesting excellent robustness. The NH4Ni2Mo2O8(OH)H2O and α-NiMoO4 phases before and after calcination, respectively, were confirmed by XRD patterns (Fig. S1†). All the HRSEM and FETEM images reported here were taken after the calcination treatment.
To obtain the heterostructured morphology of α-NiMoO4, experiments were conducted by varying the amount of TPAOH and keeping constant all the other parameters (i.e., a carbamide concentration of 0.5 M, a reaction temperature of 90 °C, and a reaction time of 10 h). When adding 10 μl of TPAOH to the growth solution, NWs with aggregated NPs were observed (Fig. S2a†), indicating that a different nucleation had materialized apart from the formation of NWs; moreover, the magnified images of the samples also revealed the self-assembly of these NPs into an NS-like-morphology via surface modification and their simultaneous attachment with the NWs. In this case, CO2 and excess NH4+ released from carbamide played key roles by acting as, respectively a soft template for the NP self-assembly and a capping agent in assisting the oriented attachment between NSs and NWs. Upon increasing the amount of TPAOH to 30 μl, the NS formation and simultaneous attachment with NWs were still observed (Fig. 1b and S2b†) but without entirely covering the NWs, indicating an insufficient amount of derived NSs to decorate the NWs. When the TPAOH was further increased to 50 μl, NS-decorated NWs were produced and, interestingly, NPs were also observed by connecting the edges of the NSs (Fig. 1d and S2c†). These heterostructured nanoassemblies resembled the Rhynchostylis retusa (R. retusa, also known as foxtail orchid) flower, as shown in the inset of Fig. S2c.† However, NSs and nanorods with broken and irregular morphologies (Fig. S2d†) appeared when using 70 μl of TPAOH. Therefore, these results show that the TPAOH amount influences the nucleation rate. The addition of 10 μl of TPAOH resulted in the formation of some NiMoO4 nucleation sites as NPs due to fast nucleation because of the different decomposition temperatures of TPAOH and carbamide, while the remaining nucleation sites were influenced by the carbamide addition and formed NWs. The nucleation rates of the NPs and NWs increased and decreased, respectively, with the increase of the TPAOH amount. In a previous report, Pavitra et al.45 already stated that the nucleation rate depends on the amount of TPAOH added to the growth solution. This is due to the separation of TPA+ and OH− from TPAOH at reaction temperatures above 70 °C and the fact that the TPA+ cations provide more nucleation sites, resulting in a nucleation rate increase with the TPAOH amount, which is in good agreement with the results of the present study. When using 50 μl of TPAOH, the desired amounts of NiMoO4 NWs, NSs, and NPs were formed and their oriented attachment-assisted self-assembly occurred simultaneously, resulting in the R. retusa-like morphology; to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study reporting such a morphology of α-NiMoO4 NWs + NSs + NPs.

Fig. 2a–d show the low- and high-magnification FETEM images and the corresponding schematic of the R. retusa-like morphology of the α-NiMoO4 NW + NSs + NPs. The FETEM observation confirmed that the NW was abundantly covered by the NSs, whose edges were connected with the NPs (Fig. 2a). The crystallinity of the NW, NS, and NP was evaluated based on selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images (Fig. 2b(i–iv) and c(v and vi)). The NW exhibited a single-crystalline nature, while the NS and NP showed polycrystallinity with a nanocrystalline behavior, as revealed by brighter spots on the diffraction rings, confirming the NW + NSs + NPs heterostructure; in addition, the NS exhibited lower intensity diffraction rings and lattice fringes compared to the NW and NP, indicating a weaker crystallinity. The EDX spectrum and the elemental mappings confirmed the presence of Ni, Mo, and O and their uniform distribution over the entire NW + NSs + NPs heterostructure.

(i–vi) Selected-area electron diffraction patterns (left) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy produced lattice fringe spacing (right) of the α-NiMoO4 NWs (top), NSs (center), and NPs (bottom). 
To verify the α-NiMoO4 phase, Rietveld refinement analysis was conducted on the XRD patterns of the NiMoO4 NW + NSs + NPs; general structure analysis system (GSAS) software was used. The results are shown in Fig. 3a, while the corresponding crystallographic data are presented in Table S1.† The calculated and experimental data agreed well with JCPDS #086-0361 and NIMS_MatNavi_42 (NIMS materials database), indicating that the synthesized NiMoO4 had a monoclinic structure with an α-phase and the space group C2/m (12). The Rietveld refinement provided the atomic coordinates and Diamond 3 software was used to model the α-NiMoO4 crystal structure (Fig. 3b), where both Ni and Mo occupy the octahedral sites and have two octahedral positions for each atom. Moreover, the adjacent MoO6 and NiO6 octahedra are connected with each other by sharing the oxygen atoms at the edges. The functional groups in the synthesized α-NiMoO4 were characterized by FTIR analysis (Fig. 3c); all the samples showed broad peaks in the wavelength region of 3100–3600 cm−1, attributed to the OH− stretching vibrations between two metal ions. Furthermore, a low-intensity peak was detected at 1610 cm−1 and assigned to the OH− bending vibrations of the water molecules absorbed. The vibration bands at 400–600 and 800–900 cm−1 are generally attributed to the NiO6 and MoO6 groups, respectively;46 in this case, the peak observed at 454 cm−1 was associated with the Ni–O building group in α-NiMoO4 and those detected at 734, 885, and 965 cm−1 were due to its Mo–O–Ni and Mo–O linkages. The surface area of the electrode materials is key in enhancing the electrochemical performance of the supercapacitor. Therefore, BET surface area analysis was performed on the prepared α-NiMoO4 NWs, α-NiMoO4 NWs + NSs, and α-NiMoO4 NWs + NSs + NPs samples. The corresponding N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms are shown in Fig. 3d, revealing typical type-IV isotherms that confirm the mesoporous characteristics of the samples. The calculated surface area of α-NiMoO4 NWs + NSs + NPs was higher (88.52 m2 g−1) than those of α-NiMoO4 NWs (36.42 m2 g−1) and α-NiMoO4 NWs + NSs (70.24 m2 g−1) and, hence, could facilitate the fast diffusion of the electrolyte ions by providing numerous electroactive sites, which enhance the charge storage capacity. The corresponding pore size distributions from the desorption isotherms were determined (Fig. S3†) using the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) technique. The α-NiMoO4 NWs showed a dominant macroporous nature and NWs + NSs exhibited a combination of mesoporous and macroporous behavior with a mesopore diameter of 35 nm, indicating that the α-NiMoO4 NSs exhibited mesoporous properties. The mesoporous nature of the α-NiMoO4 NSs was due to the formation of NSs by the self-assembling of nanoparticles. A dominant mesoporous nature was observed for the α-NiMoO4 NWs + NSs + NPs with a pore diameter of 36 nm, which confirmed the successful decoration of NSs over NWs. The surface chemical oxidation states of the heterostructured α-NiMoO4 were determined via XPS analysis, as shown in Fig. 3e. The Ni, Mo, and O peaks in the survey scan spectrum were in agreement with the EDX results. The Ni 2p core-level spectrum showed two peaks at 856.2 and 873.9 eV, associated with the Ni 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 spin–orbit doublets, along with two shake-up satellite peaks; the binding energies revealed the +2 oxidation state of the Ni species in the prepared samples. The Mo 3d spectrum exhibited two peaks at 230.2 and 235.3 eV, respectively attributed to Mo 3d5/2 and Mo 3d3/2, whose spin–orbit splitting (about 5.1 eV) corresponded to the +6 oxidation state of Mo. The O 1s spectrum showed two signals at 530.6 and 532.1 eV that were related to the oxygen species in the lattice and hydrate, respectively.

The electrochemical properties of the α-NiMoO4 samples were characterized using a conventional three-electrode system. Fig. 4a compares the CV curves of the α-NiMoO4 NWs, α-NiMoO4 NWs + NSs, and α-NiMoO4 NWs + NSs + NPs electrodes, which were measured in a potential window between −0.1 and 0.6 V at a scan rate of 20 mV s−1; they all exhibited strong redox peaks instead of rectangular shapes, demonstrating the battery-type performance of the synthesized α-NiMoO4. Among them, the heterostructured α-NiMoO4 NWs + NSs + NPs electrode showed the highest redox peak intensity and enhanced CV enclosed area, indicating better energy storage properties. This can be mainly ascribed to the heterostructured core–shell architecture of the NWs + NSs + NPs that greatly increased the electrochemical conductivity, surface area, and accessibility to additional electroactive sites during the charge storage measurements. Moreover, the several pores and the interconnected NSs and NPs on the NWs allowed efficient diffusion of the electrolyte ions and completely activated the inner core of the NWs for rapid redox reactions. The one-dimensional NWs also participated efficiently in the redox process and served as conducting scaffolds to rapidly transfer the electrons generated from the NSs and NPs towards the current collector. On the other hand, the α-NiMoO4 NWs + NSs and α-NiMoO4 NWs electrodes showed comparatively lower current density due to their lower surface area and redox activity. To estimate the capacitance performance, GCD tests were also performed at a constant current density of 2 A g−1 (Fig. 4b); the resulting non-linear curves further confirmed the battery-type charge storage process involved in the three different α-NiMoO4 samples prepared. Among them, the α-NiMoO4 NWs + NSs + NPs electrode exhibited the longest charge and discharge times due to complete electrochemical utilization of the heterostructured α-NiMoO4 NWs + NSs + NPs sample. The specific capacitance values of the three electrodes were also evaluated against the current densities, as shown in Fig. 4c, revealing the superior specific capacitance (1061 F g−1) of the α-NiMoO4 NWs + NSs + NPs electrode at a current density of 2 A g−1, with good rate capability (37.8%) at high current density (20 A g−1). At the same current density (2 A g−1), the α-NiMoO4 NWs + NSs and α-NiMoO4 NWs electrodes exhibited capacitance values of 900 and 673 F g−1, respectively. Yin et al.47 reported a specific capacitance of 777 F g−1 at a current density of 2 A g−1 for hierarchical nanosheet-based α-NiMoO4 nanotubes and Pang et al.48 reported a specific capacitance of 743 F g−1 at a current density of 2 A g−1 for α-NiMoO4 nanorods, indicating that the α-NiMoO4 NWs + NSs + NPs exhibited excellent specific capacitance as compared to the previously reported α-NiMoO4 nanostructures. EIS measurements were carried out to study the electrochemical kinetics of α-NiMoO4 NWs, α-NiMoO4 NWs + NSs and α-NiMoO4 NWs + NSs + NPs, and the obtained EIS spectra are displayed in Fig. S4.† It is well known that the semicircle diameters in the real part represent the charge transfer resistance and the slanted lines correspond to the Warburg impedance. As shown in Fig. S4,† the charge transfer resistance of α-NiMoO4 NWs + NSs + NPs was much smaller than that of α-NiMoO4 NWs and α-NiMoO4 NWs + NSs, which indicates that the rational combination of NWs, NSs and NPs in the heterostructured α-NiMoO4 synergistically served as fast ion diffusion pathways during the electrochemical process.

Therefore, the α-NiMoO4 NWs + NSs + NPs can be considered as an optimized electrode material and thus, this material was further analyzed to evaluate its electrochemical reversibility and kinetics. Fig. 4d shows its CV curves at different scan rates (5–100 mV s−1) within a fixed potential window; the responses in current density and covered CV area increased with the scan rate. Even at higher scan rates, the redox peaks were well maintained due to the transition of the reversible redox couple Ni2+/Ni3+ and vice versa. The intercalated anions (MoO42−) in NiMoO4 could only improve the conductivity but are not involved in any redox reaction during the electrochemical process.49 The constant redox behavior at increased scan rate suggests excellent electrochemical reversibility of the α-NiMoO4 NWs + NSs + NPs. The GCD curves, measured at different current densities (2–20 A g−1), are presented in Fig. 4e; the symmetric charge/discharge times and distinct voltage plateaus confirming the charge storage process in the α-NiMoO4 NWs + NSs + NPs electrode revealed its good coulombic efficiency and unique redox behavior, respectively. The synergistic effects and merits of this composite during the electrochemical process are schematized in Fig. 4f. First, the heterostructures composed of α-NiMoO4 NWs with a 1D shape provide good mechanical integrity and adhesion for the α-NiMoO4 NSs and NWs during faradaic reaction. Concurrently, 2D shaped α-NiMoO4 NSs enable contact between the highly exposed surface and hydroxyl ions, which enhances the core-level redox process. Furthermore, NPs in the heterostructure offer abundant electroactive sites and thus improve the utilization ratio of the entire α-NiMoO4 nanocomposite. Benefitting from each component in the heterostructured α-NiMoO4, the rapid diffusion of electrolyte ions and fast electron transportation result in reversible redox reactions that increase the capacitance and rate capability. Overall, from this investigation it can be inferred that the rationally combined α-NiMoO4 NWs + NSs + NPs with the desired hierarchical architectures can be used as a high-performance battery-type redox electrode for ASCs. The cycling stability of the electroactive material is another essential feature since it determines the suitability for SC practical applications. Thus, a cycling test was carried out at a constant current density of 10 A g−1 up to 4000 cycles (Fig. 4g). At the end of the test, the α-NiMoO4 NWs + NSs + NPs electrode showed outstanding cycling stability without much degradation, 96% capacitance retention, and good coulombic efficiency (99.5%). After the cycling test, the EDX spectrum and mapping images (inset of Fig. 4g) clearly show the presence of Ni, Mo and O elements without formation of any other phase/elements, suggesting the excellent durability of heterostructured α-NiMoO4 NWs + NSs + NPs. To elucidate the electrochemical conductivity of the α-NiMoO4 NWs + NSs + NPs, EIS measurements were also performed. Fig. 4h shows the Nyquist plots measured before and after 4000 cycles, revealing depressed semicircles and nearly straight lines in the low- and high-frequency regions, respectively. The first intersection of an EIS curve with the X-axis is typically associated with an equivalent series resistance (Rs), which is composed of solution resistance, active material resistance, and contact resistance between the active material and the current collector. The diameter of the semicircle, on the other hand, reveals the charge transfer resistance (Rct) between the electrolyte solution and the active material. The Rct value of the α-NiMoO4 NW + NS + NP electrode before the cycling test was 0.9 Ω; after the test, a value of 1.3 Ω was observed, indicating the good electrochemical conductivity of the composite. Given the excellent energy storage properties and good conductivity, the synthesized α-NiMoO4 NWs + NSs + NPs could serve as an effective positive electrode for ASCs.
The effective validation of the heterostructured α-NiMoO4 NWs + NSs + NPs as a battery-type electrode when combined with APC-coated Ni foam as the negative electrode, a pouch-type ASC was fabricated to enable energy storage properties. In the ASC, the two electrodes were separated with a piece of Whatman filter paper surrounded by an aqueous alkaline electrolyte (1 M KOH), which is schematized in Fig. 5a. It is believed that the ASC shared the feasibilities of capacitive and redox mechanisms to enable high power and energy density parameters. Moreover, this ASC provides a higher working potential window compared to symmetric SCs, which is more applicable for integrated energy harvesting and storage systems. For high performance, the charge balance between the α-NiMoO4 NWs + NSs + NPs and APC electrodes and the mass of the synthesized materials had to be adjusted. The electrochemical properties of the APC coated nickel foam electrode were measured in a three-electrode system and are presented in Fig. S5.† Based on the individual specific capacitance and electric quantity values of the two electrodes, the optimized mass ratio between the cathode and anode was 0.69. The fabricated ASC was first analyzed via CV and GCD measurements to evaluate its wide operating potential (Fig. 5b and c); the results showed a combined energy storage behavior even at high working potentials. Moreover, the device remained stable up to 1.6 V without any fluctuations, which means that the charge/mass ratios on both electrodes were balanced; however, when it was operated at an extreme potential (1.7 V), a slight variation was observed in the CV and GCD curves, maybe due to the oxygen evolution with the electrolyte ions. Therefore, the optimal working potential window of the fabricated ASC was identified as 0–1.6 V, which was used to further examine the stability and maximum energy storage properties. Fig. 5d shows the CV curves measured at various scan rates (10–100 mV s−1) within this optimal working potential window. Even at high scan rates, the device exhibited stable capacitive and redox-type mechanisms, indicating good reversibility and capacitive characteristics. The GCD curves (Fig. 5e) measured at different current densities (1–15 A g−1) showed unique charge/discharge times even at high current densities, revealing the good coulombic efficiency and superior energy storage properties of the ASC. The calculated specific capacitance (inset of Fig. 5f) was about 92.7 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1, with good rate capability (51.7%) even at 15 A g−1; the reduction in capacitance when increasing the current density could be due to the limited diffusion of the electrolyte ions into both electrodes. The cycling behavior of the fabricated ASC was analyzed through GCD cycles at a current density of 5 A g−1. After 10000 cycles, the device retained 90.66% of its capacitance, indicating excellent durability during long-term cycling processes. Moreover, its energy density (in W h kg−1) and power density (in W kg−1) were calculated based on the capacitance and entire mass of both electrodes by using the following equations:5,50 (2) (3)

(b) CVs with a digital photograph (inset) and (c) GCD plots as a function of potential, (d) CVs at different scan rates (10–100 mV s−1), (e) GCD curves at different current densities (1–15 A g−1) with a cell potential of 0–1.6 V, (f) cycling stability (the inset shows the calculated capacitance values), (g) Ragone plot, and (h) electrochemical impedance spectra of the ASC. 
At a current density of 1 A g−1, it achieved a maximum Ed of 31.8 W h kg−1 with a Pd of 786.5 W kg−1. Even at a higher Pd (12.3 kW kg−1), the device retained an Ed of 16.3 W h kg−1 at 15 A g−1. Overall, the maximum energy storage properties of the fabricated ASC were better than those previously reported for devices based on NiMoO4, CoMoO4@NiMoO4, NiCo2O4, NiCo2S4, and β-NiS.22,51–60 EIS analysis of the α-NiMoO4//APC-based ASC was further performed to determine its ion transport and charge transfer resistance properties. Due to the distinct electrodes, it showed good internal resistance (0.86 Ω) and charge transfer resistance (1.04 Ω); the lower Rct at the electrode/electrolyte interface was evidence of good ionic diffusion and conductivity. Given the high charge storage and good cycling stability, the fabricated ASC could serve as a potential power source for various portable electronic applications.
To demonstrate its practical applicability, two pouch-type ASCs were connected in series and charged with a direct current (DC) power supply (Fig. 6a). After charging for 20 s, the ASCs successfully illuminated various light-emitting diodes, revealing the suitability for switching and portable applications (Fig. 6b). Besides, it is also significant to harvest renewable energy, such as solar energy, to satisfy the rapidly growing energy demand and mitigate the issues surrounding fossil fuels. However, the day/night cycles and geographical distribution of solar light pave a way to find efficient energy storage systems. Based on the fast charging and high energy storage ability, the proposed ASC could be a promising candidate for solar energy harvesting. Fig. 6c schematizes a self-powered renewable system that consists of solar cells as the power unit and the proposed ASC as the energy storage unit. By utilizing solar energy, the ASC was effectively charged up to its maximum potential and the as-stored energy was used for operating a multifunctional electronic display for a long time (Fig. 6e). Based on the energy storage output and practical demonstration with a self-powered renewable device, this work could pave a way for the development of novel nanostructured materials for energy storage and conversion devices.

4. Conclusions
We have proposed a facile single-step fabrication procedure for a novel combination of heterostructured α-NiMoO4 nanoarchitectures by using TPAOH as the structure-directing agent under cost-effective and low growth temperature conditions. The amount of TPAOH added to the growth solution allowed us to effectively control the morphology of the synthesized α-NiMoO4 due to the influence of the TPA+ ions on the nucleation process. Owing to the synergistic effects of high electroactivity and large specific surface area, the heterogeneous α-NiMoO4 NWs + NSs + NPs architectures exhibited a specific capacitance of 1061 F g−1 at a current density of 2 A g−1, higher than those of α-NiMoO4 NWs (673.4 F g−1) and α-NiMoO4 NWs + NSs (900.2 F g−1) electrodes. Then, an ASC was fabricated by using this α-NiMoO4 NWs + NSs + NPs sample as the positive electrode and APC as the negative electrode, separated with a piece of filter paper, in an aqueous electrolyte solution; it exhibited superior energy and power densities along with good cycling durability. Finally, a self-powered renewable system combining a solar energy harvester and two as-fabricated ASCs was also realized to demonstrate the potentiality for renewable energy storage in an eco-friendly way, for portable electronic applications.
