    , Accepted 1st November 2019First published on 1st November 2019AbstractSolar vapor generation is an efficient way to use solar energy for seawater desalination and sewage purification. The efficient utilization of solar-generated heat is a critical and hot topic for developing one-sun driven highly efficient solar vapor generation devices. Here, we reported a three-dimensional graphene-based hive (GBH) solar evaporator that can ensure efficient heat utilization by hierarchical heat trapping and efficient heat localization and reflux as well as long-term heat storage. As a result, a significant efficiency improvement (∼9%) was demonstrated in the 3D GBH evaporator from the initial 1.95 kg m−2 h−1 (corresponding to an energy efficiency of ∼85%) to the subsequent 2.13 kg m−2 h−1. In addition, the GBH evaporator exhibited an excellent water evaporation performance under discontinuous irradiation that is 81% of that achieved by continuous solar irradiation for one hour at 1 kW m−2. The promising 3D hierarchical design offers efficient heat trapping, localization, and reflux as well as long-term heat storage which make it easy to develop highly efficient solar vapor generation devices for sunny and cloudy days.
Introduction
The harvesting and utilization of solar energy is considered an important way to meet the global need for ecological energy.1–4 Among the solar harvesting and utilization technologies, solar desalination technology can directly utilize solar energy and transfer heat to promote vapor generation, and has become an attractive approach to address energy and water scarcity issues.5–7 An ideal solar evaporator must first have efficient solar energy harvesting, photo-thermal conversion and water extraction capabilities.28 Therefore, engineering black absorbers with a porous structure including ultra-black absorbers,8–11 carbon-based materials,12–17 metal and carbon composite materials,18 hierarchical nanostructures,29,30 plasmonic structures,8,19–21,31,32etc. has been widely exploited as a highly efficient solar vapor generation approach. In pursuit of a higher vapor generation efficiency, heat utilization has been further focused and investigated. Wang's group proposed “air–water interface solar heating” that can significantly improve desalination efficiency by the high-energy state of the air–water interface.11 Chen's group proposed a heat localization design for a high steam temperature of up to 100 °C under one-sun irradiation by adding an insulating and hydrophilic layer between the absorber and bulk water that enables an 85% solar thermal efficiency at 10 kW m−2.22 A three-dimensional (3D) structure design for solar vapor generation shows advantages in solar light absorption, water pumping and heat utilization. Zhu's group demonstrated an effective improvement of solar steam efficiency by designing a three-dimensional vertebral evaporator that demonstrated a 78–85% solar steam efficiency, under one sun, by increasing the effective evaporation area.17,23 Yu's group reported 3D hierarchical nanostructured gels that showed a 94% photo-thermal conversion efficiency under one sun irradiation by changing the composition of water clusters and reducing the vaporization enthalpy of the water in the molecular meshes.24 In addition, 3D environmentally enhanced solar desalination devices have also been exploited that demonstrate an extremely high efficiency close to or even exceeding the theoretical 100% evaporation rate under one-sun irradiation by injecting environmental energy.25,26 Here, we report a 3D hierarchical GBH solar evaporator that enables a significant improvement of solar interface vapor generation by a 3D hierarchical heat trapping design. Fig. 1 shows the schematic diagram of our proposed solar desalination device with a 3D hierarchical heat trapping design. A graphene absorber coated on top of the hive acted as a light-to-heat converter and formed the first-stage heat trapping structure with the outer wall of the hive being made by an outer layer, porous fibres and inner layer. The inner wall of the hive composed of an inner layer and porous fibres formed the second-stage heat trapping structure with hexagonal holes in the hive (Fig. 1b). Fig. 1c and d show the third-stage heat trapping structure consisting of the inner wall of the hive and polypropylene foam strips wrapped by absorbent cotton (Fig. 1c and d). The preparation process of the GBH with a water path and thermal insulation layer is shown in Fig. S1.† The natural hive skeleton was employed as an efficient light trap and the first-stage heat trap (Fig. S1a and b†), and polypropylene foam strips wrapped by absorbent cotton were embedded in the hexagonal holes of the hive for achieving efficient water pumping and hierarchical heat localization and storage (Fig. S1c and d†). To ensure efficient light absorption and photo-thermal conversion, a graphene absorber (with a thickness of ∼50 nm and ∼60 nm) was coated on the hive skeleton by brushing the mixture of graphene and PVDF and a following freeze-drying process (Fig. S1e†). The hexagonal holes of the GBH device were embedded with polypropylene foam strips wrapped by absorbent cotton, and then surrounded with a thermally insulating polypropylene foam that effectively inhibited heat conduction by the sea water and thermal convection with the environment, finally providing a heat reflow and reuse by hierarchical heat reflection and trapping in the GBH device (Fig. 1c and S1d–f†). Meanwhile, an absorbent cotton strip was embedded at the bottom and the absorbent cotton layer wrapped around the polypropylene foam strips in the hexagonal holes of the hive formed 3D hierarchical water pumping channels (Fig. 1c, S1d and f†). Such a device shows a significant enhancement of solar vapor generation under one-sun irradiation through several mechanisms: (1) engineering the graphene absorber coated on the hive enables efficient broadband absorption of sunlight and excellent photo-thermal conversion. (2) Porous properties of graphene (Fig. 2c) and the porous fibre layer in the outer wall of the hive (Fig. 2d) enable efficient vapor escape, water pumping and local heating. (3) The absorbent cotton layer (∼1 mm, Fig. S1d†) wrapped on the outside of the polypropylene foam strip can effectively extract water and store it in the hexagonal holes of the hive for local preheating. (4) The high thermal conductivity of graphene combined with the water-extraction and thermal insulation design of the hive structure enable latent heat to be utilized to the maximum extent to promote steam generation. The external water channel at the bottom made by absorbent cotton ensures efficient water transfer from bulk water to the GBH (diameter of about 4 mm, Fig. S1f†). (5) Hexagonal holes comprising the inner wall of the hive made by dense inner/outer layers embedded with interwoven fibres (Fig. 2f) provide an effective heat reflow by hierarchical heat reflection whereas the insulating layer (∼3 mm) made by polypropylene foam was designed to prevent heat loss inside and below the hive. The polypropylene foam strips (diameter of about 3 mm) wrapped by the absorbent cotton can effectively prevent the dissipation of heat in the holes combined with the wall of the hexagonal holes in the hive (Fig. 1b and S1d†).

Characterization of the GBH

Fig. 2 shows the characterization results of the GBH structure. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) cross-sectional image of the graphene-based absorber (Fig. S2a†) shows that the total thickness of the graphene-based absorber is ∼50 um that consists of many nanometer pores (∼100 nm to 600 nm, Fig. S2b† and 2c) for effective vapor escape. The wall of the hive has a typical sandwich structure consisting of dense inner/outer membranes embedded with interwoven fibres (Fig. 2d–f and S2c–f†). Atomic force microscopy results show that the inner wall of the hive is denser and smoother than the outer wall (Fig. 2g and h), enabling weak heat loss.
Solar absorption and light-induced heat under one sun
An absorption spectrum was recorded using an integrating sphere model (IRS-3100) of the UV3600 spectrophotometer (Fig. 3a). The absorption efficiency is calculated using the equation (A = 1 − R − T) where A is the absorption efficiency, R is the reflection efficiency and T is the transmission efficiency. It is expected to achieve efficient absorption of sunlight in a wide wavelength rage. As shown in Fig. 3a, the solar absorption efficiency of the natural hive reaches 77%. After coating the graphene absorber on top of the hive, a solar light absorption efficiency of ∼97.5% is demonstrated in the GBH in the range of 200 nm to 2500 nm (Fig. 3a) that corresponds to a low transmittance and reflectance, enabling efficient broadband solar absorption (see Fig. S3a and b† in the ESI). Fig. 3b–g show the change of the surface temperature for the GBH with (Fig. 3e–g) and without (Fig. 3b–d) the thermal insulation structure consisting of polypropylene foam strips embedded in the hexagonal holes of the hive and a polypropylene foam layer wrapped around the hive under AM1.5 irradiation. The light-induced temperature increases rapidly reaching a higher temperature of the absorber for the GBH with the insulating layer than that without the thermal insulation wall under light irradiation. In addition, the outer surface temperature at the bottom of the GBH structure that cannot be illuminated with the thermal insulation structure is 10 °C lower than that without the thermal insulation structure after 60 min light irradiation. It is suggested that the GBH with the insulating structure can enable efficient heat localization and a low thermal conduction loss and convection loss by the design of a hierarchical heat trapping structure.

Solar vapor generation under continuous irradiation of one sun

Fig. 4 shows the evaporation performance of the GBH evaporator under one-sun irradiation. The total evaporation rate of saltwater (3.5 wt% NaCl) in a dark environment was 0.32 kg m−2 h−1 (Fig. S4d†). Under continuous AM 1.5 irradiation, the total evaporation rates of the saltwater (only saltwater without the GBH), and the GBH without and with the 3D hierarchical heat trapping structure were measured to be 0.40 kg m−2 h−1, 1.51 kg m−2 h−1 and 1.95 kg m−2 h−1, respectively (Fig. 4a). The total evaporation rate of the GBH evaporator with the 3D hierarchical heat trapping structure is 5 times that of the saltwater. The corresponding energy efficiency (ηth) of solar vapor generation is estimated using the following formula26 ηth = ṁ(Hv − Hw)/CoptPin(1)where ṁ is the net evaporation rate in the steady state phase (3000–3600 s), which is calculated from the total evaporation rate, the evaporation rate in darkness and only saltwater under one sun irradiation (see Fig. S4†in the ESI). Hv and Hw are the enthalpy of the vapor (∼50 °C) and liquid phase (∼30 °C), which are about 2592.0 kJ kg−1 and 125.70 kJ kg−1, respectively.27Pin is the solar irradiation power of one sun (AM1.5, 1 kW m−2) and refers to the optical concentration on the absorber surface (Copt = 1).

(a) The water mass change curve of the GBH with and without the 3D hierarchical heat trapping structure. (b) Plot showing the temperature change of bulk water and each part of the GBH evaporator with the 3D hierarchical heat trapping structure during the first cycle (1st hour). (c and d) Cycling performance of the GBH evaporator with the 3D hierarchical heat trapping structure in simulated seawater (3.5 wt% NaCl). (e) The water's mass loss of the GBH evaporator with the 3D hierarchical heat trapping structure at the second cycle (2nd hour) in pure water, simulated seawater (3.5 wt% NaCl) and the natural sample from the East China Sea, respectively. 
The net evaporation rate in the steady state (3000–3600 s) of the GBH without and with the heat concentration structure reached 0.84 kg m−2 h−1 and 1.24 kg m−2 h−1, respectively. The corresponding solar-thermal conversion efficiency of the solar vapor generator was 57% and 85%. It is suggested that the GBH with the 3D hierarchical heat trapping structure shows an efficiency improvement of ∼28% compared to the GBH without the 3D hierarchical heat trapping structure. The rapid increase of the surface temperature of the GHB absorber (T3, Fig. 4b) indicates that the heat was mainly utilized to increase the temperature (pre-heating for ∼600 s, see the blue curve), while the slow increase indicates tremendous energy consumption for evaporation26 (steady state evaporation after 600 s, see the blue curve). As the temperature increases, the evaporation of water is accelerated and the point of inflection shows an energy balance value of water between heating and evaporation. The green curve shows the temperature change of the absorbent cotton layer of the internal water channel in the middle of the hive (T2, Fig. 4b) during evaporation where the temperature remains at ∼28 °C for the first 250 s and then persistently increases to 44.6 °C within 3600 s, and is only ∼3 °C lower than the surface temperature of the absorber. This indicates that the GHB has a highly efficient solar interface on the sandwich structured hive walls, thus effectively enhancing the area of heated water. Meanwhile, the temperature of the bulk water (T0, Fig. 4b) and the interface between the GBH evaporator and bulk water (T1, Fig. 4b) slightly increased under light irradiation, and only increased by 1.4 °C and 8 °C, respectively, in 3600 s (see the red curve and the brown curve in Fig. 4b). This indicates that the designed evaporator has low heat conduction loss and high heat trapping capacity, which further ensure highly efficient heat utilization, thus enabling a high solar vapor generation efficiency. Fig. 4c and d show the evaporation performance cycle of the GBH with a heat concentration structure. This first total evaporation rate of the HGB evaporator is 1.95 kg m−2 h−1 (the corresponding evaporation rate is 85%) under 1 h solar light irradiation (water temperature 28 °C, air humidity 36%). The uncooled GBH structure after the first cycle is placed under the same initial conditions (water temperature 28 °C, air humidity 36%) for the second and third test. As shown in Fig. 4c, the total evaporation rate of the GBH evaporator increased to 2.13 kg m−2 h−1 for the 2nd cycle (2nd h) and 2.14 kg m−2 h−1 for the 3rd cycle, which is ∼9% higher than that of the first cycle (with a total evaporation rate of 1.95 kg m−2 h−1, corresponding to an evaporation efficiency of 85%). After that, the total evaporation rate is restored to 1.93 kg m−2 h−1 for the 4th cycle when the GBH was naturally cooled for one hour (both internal and surface temperatures reduced to the initial temperature of 28 °C). Followed by the test, the total evaporation rate remains at 2.16 kg m−2 h−1 (5th hour) and 2.15 kg m−2 h−1 (6th hour) for the last two uncooled experiments. This clearly indicates effective heat storage of the GBH with the hierarchical heat trapping structure resulting in a 9% improvement of solar water evaporation rate.
Such a significant enhancement of solar interface vapor generation can be attributed to the design of the GBH evaporator with hierarchical heat utilization and storage ability. In addition, the evaporation rate of the GBH evaporator is 2.18 kg m−2 h−1, 2.13 kg m−2 h−1 and 2.15 kg m−2 h−1 for pure, saltwater and even the seawater (from the East China Sea, in Fig. 4d), respectively, which shows the same evaporation effect in the three typical water qualities, indicating a stable and robust solar desalination ability.
Solar vapor generation under discontinuous one-sun irradiation
To study the enhancement of solar interface vapor generation, the evaporation performance of the GBH evaporator is presented under continuous solar light irradiation. As shown in Fig. 5a, the surface temperature (A, red line) of the absorber rapidly increases to 40 °C in the first 1000 s and remains steady under continuous irradiation but rapidly cools down after light off, while the internal temperature (B, black line) of the GBH continuously increases to 38 °C within 3500 s under continuous irradiation and slowly cools after light off.

(a) Plot showing the temperature change of the absorber surface and inner side of the GBH evaporator with heat concentration during a test cycle (1 h). (b) Curve of evaporation of saltwater (3.5 wt% NaCl) with different test cycles under discontinuous irradiation. (c) Comparison of the evaporation under continuous and discontinuous irradiation. (d) The evaporation rate change of the dark environment before and after continuous irradiation for one hour. 
This can be attributed to the heat storage ability of the GBH with the hierarchical heat trapping structure that is helpful to develop an all-weather solar desalination device. The cloudy weather in nature is simulated with discontinuous irradiation of one sun as shown in Fig. 5b. Turning off the light source (non-irradiation time) for 2 min after turning on the light source (irradiation time, AM1.5, 1 kW m−2) for 4 min as a time cycle, the blue line in Fig. 5b indicates the evaporation curve of the saltwater obtained after 10 cycles. Turning off the light source (non-irradiation time) for 10 min after turning on the light source (irradiation time, AM1.5, 1 kW m−2) for 10 min as a time cycle, the green line in Fig. 5b indicates the evaporation curve of the saltwater obtained after 3 cycles. Turning off the light source (non-irradiation time) for 10 min after turning on the light source (irradiation time, AM1.5, 1 kW m−2) for 20 min as a time cycle, the red line in Fig. 5b indicates the evaporation curve of the saltwater obtained after 2 cycles. Comparing the green and red evaporation curves, it was found that the evaporation rate increases with increasing irradiation time at the same non-irradiation time (Fig. 5b). Comparing the blue and red evaporation curves, it was found that the evaporation rate increases with decreasing time of one cycle at the same ratio of irradiation and non-irradiation time (Fig. 5b). The evaporation rate of the GBH with the heat storage structure after 10 cycles (blue curve) can still be 2 times higher than that of saltwater that was continuously irradiated for one hour (Fig. 5b). The mass loss of water caused by discontinuous irradiation (red curve, 1.3 g h−1) is 81% of that caused by continuous irradiation (red curve, 1.6 g h−1) as shown in Fig. 5c. In addition, the total evaporation rates of the dark environment increased from 0.5 × 10−4 g s−1 to 1.3 × 10−4 g s−1 before and after continuous irradiation for one hour (Fig. 5d), further indicating an excellent evaporation ability under discontinuous solar irradiation. Such results show that the GBH evaporator has a highly efficient energy utilization efficiency by its heat trapping and storage under discontinuous irradiation.
Outdoor solar desalination

Fig. 6 shows a large-scale GBH evaporator (diameter ∼ 26 cm, thickness ∼ 3.5 cm) floating on the water surface of the vapor generating device on the roof of the Tang building (Collaborative Innovation Center at the Nanjing University). The polypropylene foam was wrapped around the GBH evaporator to eliminate the evaporation of unmasked parts of the GBH evaporator. The natural solar power and the mass of evaporation were measured using an optical power meter and balance. The experiment lasted for 7 h from 8:30 to 15:30 (Fig. 6b), and 350 ml of water was collected (the corresponding water collection rate reached 0.24 l m−2 h−1). To evaluate the solar desalination result of the GBH evaporator, the concentration of Na+ before and after desalination from five simulated seawater samples is detected using a conductivity coupled plasma spectrometer (ICP-OES, PTIMA 5300 DV, 0.1 mg l−1 in accuracy), including the Baltic sea (0.8 wt%), the North sea (∼1.4 wt%), the World ocean (3.5 wt%), the Red sea (4.1 wt%) and the Dead sea (10 wt%). It is clearly observed that the concentration of Na+ of the five simulated seawater samples strikingly decreased (by ∼four orders of magnitude; Fig. 6c), and were approximately two orders of magnitude below the drinking water standards defined by the World Health Organization and the US Environmental Protection Agency standards.21 Further, a natural sample of the East China Sea (from Xiamen of China) was used for desalination by the GBH evaporator. After desalination, the concentrations of all four primary ions (Na+, Mg2+, K+ and Ga+) significantly reduced, below the values typically obtained by membrane-based (10–500 mg l−1) and distillation-based (1–50 mg l−1) seawater desalination techniques.21

Conclusions
We reported efficient utilization of solar-generated heat for one-sun driven highly efficient solar vapor generation by a 3D design of a GBH structure with the capability of hierarchical heat trapping and efficient heat reflux and storage. Meanwhile, the GHB evaporator exhibits a broadband solar harvesting efficiency (∼97.5% from 200 nm to 2500 nm), highly efficient conversion of light to heat under one-sun irradiation and multi-level water pumping and vapor escape (∼nm to ∼mm). As a result, a significant efficiency improvement (∼9%) was demonstrated in the GBH evaporator from the initial 1.95 kg m−2 h−1 (corresponding to an evaporation efficiency of ∼85%) to the subsequent 2.13 kg m−2 h−1. In addition, efficient solar vapor generation was achieved using the GBH evaporator under discontinuous irradiation that is 81% of that achieved by continuous solar irradiation for one hour at 1 kW m−2. Such improvement is mainly attributed to the 3D design of the GBH architecture with the capability of hierarchical heat trapping and efficient heat localization and reflux as well as long-term heat storage. The promising hierarchical architecture design offers efficient utilization of solar-generated heat for solar desalination that is helpful for developing highly efficient solar vapor generation devices under one-sun continuous and discontinuous irradiation.
Methods
Honeycomb cleaning and honey removal
First, a natural hive having hexagonal holes with a thickness of 2–3 cm and a diameter of about 4 mm is subjected to preliminary mechanical cleaning, and then placed in boiling water and ultrasonically cleaned for 10 minutes at 60 °C; this procedure was repeated 3 times to remove residual honey in the holes. Finally, it was dried in an oven at 80 °C for 30 minutes.
Preparation of the graphene absorber
PVDF and NMP (1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone) were purchased from Aladdin, and single-layer graphene powder (chip diameter: 0.5–5 μm, thickness: ∼ 0.8 nm) was purchased from XFNANO, INC. First, PVDF and NMP were prepared into a mixed solvent of PVDF in a mass ratio of 1:19, and then the mixed solvent was added to the graphene powder whose mass is 4 times the mixed solvent, and then a few drops of NMP were added. Subsequently, a graphene slurry was prepared by magnetic stirring for 5 hours and brushed it on top of the hive. Finally, the graphene-coated hive was freeze-dried for 8 hours to form a graphene film on top of the hive.
Experimental set-up for solar desalination
The test system for solar desalination included a solar simulator (Newport Sol2 A™) and a high accuracy balance (LiangPing Tech, FA2204, 0.1 mg in accuracy). The optical power on the surface of the membrane was measured using a standard solar cell (Newport 91150 V) and the natural light power was measured using a solar power meter (Xin Bao Keyi, SM206-SOLAR, resolution: 0.1 W m−2, wavelength range: 340–1100 nm). The temperature was measured using a thermal infrared imager (Fluke Tix 580) and a thermocouple thermometer (Bolsen, HT9815 and UNI-T, UT325).
