Here, we demonstrate efficient organic solar cells by tuning of the electronic properties through simple structural modulation of coumarin-based electron donors. The OSCs with C2:BThIND-Cl:Y6 ternary blends exhibit a PCE of 13.54%, with an increased open circuit voltage (VOC) compared to the C1:BThIND-Cl:Y6-based devices (11.27%). Interestingly, an efficient charge transfer is revealed despite a reduced HOMO orbital offset of 0.02–0.04 eV between the C2 donor and BThIND-Cl and Y6 acceptors, resulting in a lower energy loss of 0.45 eV in ternary devices while still maintaining a maximum EQE of ∼80%@820 nm. The work demonstrates the importance of simple coumarin-based donors and their role in performance improvement for fullerene-free ternary OSCs by facilitating charge carrier transport with suppressed recombination.
Introduction
The inherent flexible nature of carbon-based semiconducting oligomers and polymers has performed a key role in the development of efficient organic solar cells (OSCs).1,2 The major advantages of organic semiconductors are their versatile molecular design, functionalization, low-cost solution-processability and tunable optoelectronic properties. Most importantly, their absorption range can be varied from the visible to the near-infrared (NIR) region to provide colorful OSCs. In the past two decades, many novel oligomeric and polymeric donor materials were developed, reaching power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of ∼11% in combination with fullerene derivatives as the acceptor.3,4 However, the major breakthrough came in around 2015 when planar ring-fused heteroacene-based acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) type molecules were developed as fullerene-free acceptors (FFA) to replace fullerene derivatives and currently, their PCEs have increased steeply up to 18%.5–8 Ever since, many groups have been involved in the development of fused A–D–A molecules, such as IDIC and ITIC by the Zhan group,9 a C–O bridged acceptor by the Ding group,10 indacenodithiophene-based acceptor O-IDTBR by the McCulloch group,11 fluorinated derivative IT-4F by the Hou group,12 and Y6 by the Zou group13 and their use as acceptors in high performance devices (Fig. 1). Moreover, all small molecule-based devices have a major advantage over their polymer counterparts with respect to control over synthesis, molecular purity, tunable optical properties and energetics and overall device reproducibility. To date, many new planar fused-ring electron acceptors have been synthesized showing an excellent performance in OSCs.14

Zhan and co-workers reported the first series of multifused A–D–A acceptors BThIDT (commonly known as IDIC or IC–C6IDT–IC) and ITIC based on indacenodithiophene or an indacenodithieno[3,2-b]thiophene core flanked by 2-(3-oxo-2,3-dihydroinden-1-ylidene)malononitrile (DCI) moieties.9,15 A PCE of 6.8% was reported for the PTB7-Th:ITIC blend without any follow-up treatment. The PBDB-T1:IDIC based as cast inverted OSC gave a PCE of 8.7% ascribed to “face-on” π–π ordering, appropriate phase separation, and relatively good charge transport.15,16 Further screening of the BThIDT acceptor with different polymer donors using 0.25 vol% of 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) as a solvent additive enhanced the PCE to ∼11%.17 The BThIDT acceptor has also been tested in all small-molecule OSCs providing an excellent PCE of 9.73%.18 In a conventional OSC using benzodithiophene-based small molecule donor DRTB-T and an IDIC acceptor, Hou and co-workers reported a PCE of 9.08% after SVA treatment.19 Recently, Sharma and co-workers reported a chlorinated derivative BThIDT-Cl which showed an enhanced PCE of 12.36% and a fill factor (FF) of 0.71 when blended with a PM6 (also called PBDB-TF) polymer, while the non-chlorinated analogue BThIDT gave a PCE of only 8.04% and FF of 0.66.20 The higher performance with the chlorinated acceptor could be due to the high polarizability of the C–Cl bond and high electronegativity.
Among these acceptor molecules planar 2,2′-((2Z,2′Z)-((12,13-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-3,9-diundecyl-12,13-dihydro-[1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4-e]thieno[2′′,3′′:4′,5′]thieno[2′,3′:4,5]pyrolo[3,2-g]thieno[2′,3′:4,5]thieno[3,2-b]indole-2,10-diyl)bis(methanylylidene))bis(5,6-difluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-indene-2,1-diylidene))dimalononitrile (Y6, also known as BTP-4F) is one of the champion molecular acceptors reaching PCEs of over 16%.21–27 Shoaee and co-workers estimated extraordinarily long electron and hole diffusion lengths of 330 nm and 70 nm for a PM6:Y6 active layer, a value much higher than those for other organic blends (10–20 nm).28 The acceptor Y6 showed a broad absorption band covering 480–1000 nm with the maximum at around 820 nm (Eoptg = 1.34 eV) in a thin film which is beneficial for absorbing more photons in the NIR region. Zhu et al. demonstrated an excellent PCE of 16.88% for a PM6:Y6 based OSC prepared from chloroform with 0.5 vol% CN as the solvent additive followed by thermal annealing at 80 °C.27 Recently, using a D18 polymer containing a dithieno[3′,2′:3,4; 2′′,3′′:5,6]benzo[1,2-c][1,2,5]thiadiazole unit and the Y6 acceptor, an excellent PCE of 18.2% (certified 17.6%) was achieved upon solvent vapor annealing (SVA) treatment with chloroform, the highest value reported to date for OSCs.8
As a step further to boost the PCE, ternary devices were constructed using FFAs in combination with small molecule or polymer donors. The third component in the blend could either be a donor or an acceptor. The advantage of this three-component system is to cover a broad spectral range to achieve high JSC and balance the charge transport properties. Implementation of FFAs in ternary OSCs resulted in enhanced PCEs of over 16%.5,22,29,30 For example, with the addition of a small amount of PC71BM as the third component to the binary blend PM6:Y6, the JSC and the FF increased due to enhanced absorption in the high energy region and balanced charge transport, thus enhancing the PCE to 16.5–16.7% compared to ∼15.5% for the PM6:Y6 binary blend.22,31,32 By adding 20 wt% of BTP-M, an analogue of Y6 where the electron-withdrawing terminal F atoms are replaced by electron-donating methyl groups, to a PM6:Y6 blend, the PCE was enhanced to 17.0% with a JSC of 26.56 mA cm−2 and a low Eloss of 0.45 eV ascribed to the formation of alloy acceptors.26 A PCE of 10.3% has been reported for a ternary blend of PTZ1:IDIC:ITIC using solvent vapour annealing during spin-coating.33 Li and co-workers achieved a decent PCE of 11.1% for a PSTz:ITIC:IDIC blend due to the formation of a cascade energy gradient for charge transport.16
With respect to donor materials, many A–D–A small molecules comprising heteroaromatic cores terminated with different acceptor groups have been developed.3,34–37 However, after the invention of fullerene-free acceptors, research on donor materials has slowed down.38 Recently, we have successfully implemented a wide-bandgap coumarin-based donor molecule showing decent PCEs of 8.31% in binary and 11.56% in ternary blend fullerene-free OSCs.39 Coumarin-based donor molecules have been systematically studied in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs).40–43 Conversely, only a few coumarin-based structures have been studied in OSCs. Coumarin-based molecules are very promising because of their strong photoresponse in the visible region and tunable energy levels to match with other device components. In DSSCs, they showed good long-term stability under light soaking stress. Using complementary absorbing coumarin-7 as the third component in a PTB7:PC71BM blend a high PCE of 10.3% was reported.44 Coumarin-7 helped to facilitate charge transport and reduce recombination in the device. Addition of coumarin-7 in a fullerene-free PTB7-Th:ITIC blend gave a PCE of 10.16% compared to the 7.5% for the PTB7-Th:ITIC binary device. The improvement was mainly ascribed to the N–H⋯OC hydrogen bonding between the coumarin and ITIC acceptor.45 Influence of hydrogen bonding was also demonstrated for a ternary device based on an imine-functionalized coumarin derivative, which formed a noncovalent hydrogen bond with the CO group of the ITIC acceptor.46 Bhosale and co-workers achieved a PCE of 4.2% by using a coumarin-based acceptor blended with a P3HT polymer donor.47
In this contribution, we report the photovoltaic characterization of two simple dimethylaminobenzene- and triphenylamine-substituted coumarin-based donors C1 and C2 in fullerene-free OSCs. Molecules C1 and C2 are used as electron donors along with BThIND-Cl and Y6 as electron acceptors for the fabrication of solution-processed fullerene free binary and ternary OSCs (structures shown in Fig. 1). After the optimization the C1:BThIND-Cl, C2:BThIND-Cl, C1:Y6 and C2:Y6 based binary OSCs exhibited a PCE of 8.26%, 9.46%, 8.04% and 9.72%, respectively. The PCE of the ternary OSCs using C1:BThIND-Cl:Y6 and C2:BThIND-Cl:Y6 blends was further improved to 11.27% and 13.54%, respectively due to the improved charge transport process in the blend.
Results and discussion
The coumarin–triphenylamine conjugate C2 was synthesized with 70% yield by a Knoevenagel condensation reaction of 3-acetyl-7-(diethylamino)-2H-chromen-2-one 1 with 4-diphenylaminobenzaldehyde 2 in ethanol at ∼80 °C (Scheme S1, ESI†). The compound was characterized by NMR and mass spectral analysis. The thermal stability of C1 and C2 was investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) (Fig. S1, ESI†). Under a nitrogen atmosphere, the onset temperature with 5% weight-loss (Td) for C1 and C2 is 351 and 372 °C, respectively, demonstrating good thermal stability of the molecules.

Fig. 2 and S2 (ESI†) depict the absorption and emission spectra of C1 and C2 in solution and thin films and the data are presented in Table 1. The absorption spectra of C2 in chloroform solution and in a thin film at room temperature are shown in Fig. 2 and S1† and compared with those of the earlier reported compound C1. The subtle change in the molecular structure by replacing dimethylamine in C1 with diphenylamine in C2 slightly red shifts the absorption band. The molar extinction coefficient of C2 is found to be 47800 M−1 cm−1. Compared to the solution, a 13–14 nm red shift was observed for both compounds in thin films with an additional shoulder at around 522 nm for C2. The slight red-shift of C2 compared to C1 in the thin film (∼3 nm) could be due to the planarization of the two phenyl rings which could further participate in the delocalization of π-electrons and increase intramolecular charge transfer leading to a red-shift in the absorption. Further planarization and structural reorganization of the phenyl rings in C2 further improve the π–π stacking of the molecule in the solid state giving rise to a shoulder at lower energy. Although dimethylamino is a stronger donor compared to the diphenylamino group, the methyl groups do not participate in the delocalization. The optical energy gaps (Eoptg) for C2 calculated from the solution and thin films are 2.32 and 2.06 eV, respectively, and are 0.01 to 0.04 eV lower than those for C1. The emission maximum of C2 displayed a 7 nm bathochromic shift compared to that of C1, while in thin films, both compounds showed a similar emission band with the maximum at 588 nm. The E0–0 transition values for both C1 and C2, calculated from the intersection of absorption and emission spectra, are ∼2.4 eV for the solution and 2.26 eV for thin films. The absorption maxima of BThIND-Cl and Y6 acceptors in thin films are 748 and 832 nm, respectively, and are complementary to the absorption of C1 and C2.

The electrochemical behavior of C1 and C2 was studied by cyclic voltammetry using thin films deposited on a platinum electrode as the working electrode in acetonitrile solution (Fig. S3, ESI†). The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) estimated from the onset of the oxidation wave is presented in Fig. 2c. The HOMO value of C2 was estimated to be −5.62 eV which was down-shifted by 0.22 eV compared to that of C1 dye. This could be because of the diphenylamino substituent in C2 which is slightly less electron donating than the dimethylamino group as in C1, because an sp2-carbon of phenyl rings is more electronegative than an sp3-carbon of methyl groups. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) value determined from the difference between the optical gap and HOMO energy is −3.30 and −3.56 eV for C1 and C2, respectively. The lowering of the HOMO energy level for C2 is beneficial to achieve high VOC.
The crystallinity of C1 and C2 was investigated by X-ray diffraction measurement and is shown in Fig. 2d. The films of C1 and C2 showed a similar (100) diffraction peak located at 2θ = 4.98° with a d-spacing of 1.79 nm corresponding to the lamellar inter-chain distance. Moreover, C1 and C2 exhibit clear (010) diffraction peaks at 2θ = 23.04° and 23.48°, respectively, corresponding to a π–π stacking distance of 0.391 nm and 0.384 nm. Compared to C1, C2 exhibits a stronger (100) diffraction peak and small π–π stacking distance, indicating the enhanced crystallinity and denser molecular packing of C2, which is beneficial for higher hole mobility.
The electron density distribution of the frontier orbitals for C1 and C2 was studied by density functional theory calculations (DFT) using a B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) basic set and is shown in Fig. 3 (details in the Experimental section). The charge transfer absorption bands of both molecules are found to be from the HOMO → LUMO. As shown in Fig. 3, the HOMO electron density distribution is mainly localized on the donor dimethylaminobenzene group in C1 and the triphenylamine group in C2 and the LUMO is mainly located on the coumarin moiety providing sufficient overlap of both the donor and acceptor to guarantee efficient charge transfer. The calculated internal ground state dipole moments (μg) for C1 and C2 are 3.22 debye and 5.30 debye, respectively. The electrostatic potential distribution of the molecules is shown in Fig. 3c. The electronegative carbonyl groups with the adjacent phenyl ring have a negative electrostatic potential (ESP), while the electron donating amino nitrogen has a positive ESP. Moreover, the different ESP distribution on the diphenylamine and dimethylamine moieties further supports the weaker electron donating ability of arylamine compared to alkylamine. It has been reported that an increase in the ESP difference between the donor and acceptor molecules enhances the intermolecular interaction and thus facilitates charge separation and transport.48

(c) Electrostatic potential (ESP) distribution of C1 and C2. 
The dielectric constant of C1 and C2 measured at a frequency of 10 kHz was about 3.4 and 3.92, respectively. Moreover, the dipole moment of C2 is higher than that for C1. Since the exciton binding energy is inversely proportional to the dielectric constant, the exciton binding energy for C2 may be lower than that for C1, and a small driving force is needed for exciton dissociation. A larger dipole moment could help to decrease the Coulomb binding energy of the exciton in the excited state and to improve the charge separation.49
The energy level diagrams of C1, C2, BThIND-Cl and Y6 are presented in Fig. 2c. It can be seen that the LUMO offsets between the C1 or C2 donor and BThIND-Cl or Y6 acceptor are higher than the threshold value needed for the effectual exciton dissociation and electron transfer from the LUMO of the donors into the LUMO of these acceptors. The HOMO offsets between C1 and BThIND or Y6 are close (0.24–0.26 eV) to the threshold value required for the exciton dissociation and hole transfer; therefore we assume that the efficient hole transfer from the HOMO of C1 into the HOMO of either BThIND-Cl or Y6 takes place in the blends. However, the HOMO offsets between C2 and BThIND-Cl or Y6 are very small (0.02–0.06 eV); therefore PL spectra of the neat BThIND-Cl, Y6 and their blends with C2 are recorded and shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†). The PL intensity of either BThINd-Cl or Y6 was effectively quenched when blended with C2, indicating that a small HOMO offset of ∼0.02 eV is sufficient for dissociation of photogenerated excitons in fullerene-free acceptors and subsequent transfer of holes into the HOMO of small molecule donors. Many literature reports revealed that the small HOMO offset is sufficient for efficient charge separation in OSCs based on fullerene-free acceptors.50–55
It is already well established that the open circuit voltage (VOC) of the OSCs is primarily determined by the difference between the HOMO energy of the donor and LUMO energy of the acceptor; therefore a donor material with a deep HOMO energy level is required to achieve a high value of VOC. We have used two small molecules C1 and C2 as donors, which exhibit HOMO energy levels of −5.40 eV and 5.62 eV, respectively, and the OSCs are based on these two donors along with fullerene-free acceptors beneficial for a high value of VOC.
We have used C1 or C2 as the donor and BTHIND-Cl or Y6 as the acceptor for the construction of the fullerene free OSCs using a conventional configuration i.e. ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/PFN/Al. Initially we have scanned the photovoltaic performance using different weight ratios of the donor and acceptor using chloroform as the processing solvent. The photovoltaic parameters are presented in Tables S1–S4 (ESI†). The best photovoltaic performance for all the devices was obtained with a weight ratio of 1:1.5 and a total concentration of 16 mg mL−1. The OSCs based on the optimized as cast layers showed a PCE of 4.61% (JSC = 9.54 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.99 V and FF = 0.49), 5.39% (JSC = 9.98 mA cm−2, VOC = 1.06 V and FF = 0.51), 4.37% (JSC = 10.86 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.79 V and FF = 0.51) and 5.11% (JSC = 11.04 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.89 and FF = 0.52) for C1:BThIND-Cl, C2:BThINd-Cl, C1:Y6 and C2:Y6, respectively. The overall PCEs for the as cast devices are low maybe due to the inferior morphology of the active layer which hampers the charge transport in the BHJ active layer and increases the charge recombination leading to low values of both JSC and the FF. In order to improve the PCEs, the optimized as cast active layers were subjected to solvent vapor annealing (SVA) for 40 s in a THF environment. The current–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the OSCs based on SVA treated active layers are shown in Fig. 4 and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are compiled in Table 2. The OSCs based on C1:BThIND-Cl, C2:BThIND-Cl, C1:Y6 and C2:Y6, showed an overall PCE of 8.26%, 9.46%, 8.04% and 9.72%, respectively, mainly due to the improvement in both JSC and FF values. The VOC values of the C2-based OSCs are higher than those for the C1 counterpart, which is associated with the deeper HOMO energy level of C2 than C1. Moreover, the VOC of the BThIND-Cl-based devices is higher compared to that of the Y6 counterpart, originating from the high lying LUMO energy level of BThIND-Cl relative to Y6. These results are consistent with the fact that the VOC is directly related to the energy difference between the HOMO of the donor and the LUMO of the acceptor in the blend.56

In order to confirm the value of JSC obtained from the J–V characteristics, we have measured the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the optimized OSCs and presented in Fig. 3. It can be seen that the OSCs based on the Y6 acceptor showed a photoresponse from 350 to 920 nm, whereas for the BThIND-Cl counterpart the photoresponse is limited only up to 830 nm, which is consistent with the absorption spectra of the corresponding binary blends (Fig. S5, ESI†). The Y6-based OSCs resulted in higher JSC values irrespective of the donor C1 or C2. The OSCs based on the C2 donor showed slightly higher values of EQE compared to those based on C1 regardless of the acceptor BThIND-Cl or Y6, which may be related to slightly broader absorption spectra of C2 as compared to C1. The values of JSC integrated from the EQE spectra are also shown in Table 2, which are very close to the JSC values observed in J–V characteristics under illumination, signifying the consistency of the measured photovoltaic data.
The energy loss (Eloss) an important factor for the OSCs can be estimated as Eloss = Eg – qVOC, where Eg is the effective bandgap of the active layer and taken from the onset of the EQE spectra of the OSC.57 The Eloss values for the OSCs based on C1:BThIND-Cl, C2:BThIND-Cl, C1:Y6 and C2:Y6 acceptors are about 0.53 eV, 0.44 eV, 0.60 eV and 0.50 eV, respectively. The lower value of Eloss for the C2-based binary OSCs than C1 ones may be related to the small HOMO offset between the donor and acceptor leading to reduction of the non-radiative loss.58,59 Moreover, the dielectric constant and dipole moment for C2 were higher than those for C1 indicating smaller binding energy of excitons generated in C2 as compared to C1 that needed a small amount of driving force for exciton dissociation and charge transfer in C2-based active layers as compared to their C1 counterparts,60 leading to reduction in the Eloss and high value of VOC. The Eloss for the ternary devices based on C1 and C2 is estimated to be 0.57 and 0.45 eV, respectively.
Since Y6 and BThIND-Cl showed complementary absorption behavior, the blend of these two acceptors along with the donors (C1 or C2) can increase the light harvesting ability of the active layer. Moreover, the OSCs based on BThIND-Cl exhibit a higher VOC than their Y6 counterparts whereas Y6 based OSCs showed larger values of JSC; therefore, the ternary blend takes advantage of both the acceptors. Ternary OSCs were fabricated by adding BThIND-Cl to the C1:Y6 or C2:Y6 blend. The D:A ratio was maintained at 1:1.5 by weight as in the optimized binary system and varied for the ratio of acceptor components, i.e. for BThIND-Cl:Y6 from 0.1:1.4 to 0.4:1.1. Details of the photovoltaic parameters for the ternary OSCs cast using chloroform solution are summarized in Tables S5 and S6 (ESI†). The weight ratio of 0.3:1.2 for the acceptor components showed the optimal photovoltaic performance for the as cast ternary OSCs with a PCE of 8.97% (JSC = 18.42 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.84 V and FF = 0.58) and 11.35% (JSC = 19.38 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.96 V and FF = 0.61), for C1 and C2, respectively. After this the optimized ternary active layers were subjected to SVA treatment for 40 s in a THF environment (the photovoltaic parameters for the devices with different SVA treatments are shown in Tables S7 and S8, ESI†). The J–V characteristics of the OSCs based on optimized ternary blends are shown in Fig. 4 and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 2. The overall PCE of the OSCs based on C1:BThIND-Cl:Y6 and C2:BThIND-Cl:Y6 is found to be 11.27% and 13.54%, respectively. The EQE spectra of the OSCs are presented in Fig. 4 and agree well with the film absorption spectra of the ternary blend (Fig. 2b). Compared to the binary counterparts, the ternary OSCs showed a broader photoresponse from 650 nm to 880 nm, indicating the enhanced light harvesting in the ternary OSCs, resulting from more exciton generation in the active layer, and justifying the origin of the higher JSC. The integrated JSC values obtained from the EQE spectra are also summarized in Table 2, and are in close resemblance to the values observed in J–V characteristics under illumination. Moreover, the VOC of the ternary devices is higher than that of Y6-based and lower than that of BThIND-Cl-based binary counterparts, which is in aggrement with the high lying LUMO energy level of BThIND-Cl relative to Y6. As can be seen from Tables S5 and S6 (ESI†) the VOC of the ternary OSCs increases linearly with the increase of the BThIND-Cl concentration in the acceptors, indicating the formation of an alloy acceptor where the combination of Y6:BThIND-Cl worked as a single acceptor in the ternary blend.
The trend in the photovoltaic performance in the ternary based OSCs is similar for both C1 and C2 as donors; therefore, we describe the charge carrier generation and recombination only for the binary and ternary OSCs based on the C2 donor. In order to get information about the energy or charge transfer in the ternary active layer, we have performed PL measurement of the pristine BThIND-Cl and Y6 and BThIND-Cl:Y6 blend excited close to the absorption peak of BThIND-Cl (Fig. S6, ESI†). The PL spectra of BThIND-Cl partially overlap with the absorption spectra of Y6. Therefore, when the BThIND-Cl:Y6 blend is excited at 760 nm, the PL peak of BThIND-Cl is significantly quenched, while the PL intensity of Y6 is increased. These results indicate the effective energy transfer from BThIND-Cl to Y6. The energy transfer signifies the effective utilization of the exciton dissociation in the ternary active layer, favorable for high JSC.61 After confirming the energy transfer process from the PL measurements, we can assume that there is a better miscibility of BThIND-Cl and Y6 in the active layer.62
In order to get more information as to whether the charge transfer between Y6 and BThIND-Cl is possible or not, we have fabricated the OSCs based on pristine BThIND-Cl and Y6 and blend BThIND-Cl:Y6. The OSC based on BThIND-Cl:Y6 showed a JSC of 0.36 mA cm−2 which is in between that of Y6 (0.46 mA cm−2) and BThIND-Cl (0.23 mA cm−2), indicating almost negligible charge transfer between BThIND-Cl and Y6. As can be seen from Fig. 2c the HOMO and LUMO offsets between BThIND-Cl and Y6 of 0.04 and 0.12 eV, respectively, do not allow for efficient charge transfer between the two acceptors, as confirmed from the PL spectra of the BThIND-Cl:Y6 blend which reveal that exciton dissociation at the interface to the two acceptors is not possible, in spite of the significant light absorption by the blend of two acceptors. Therefore, two electron transfer pathways are possible in the ternary blend: (a) donor (C1 or C2) to BThIND-Cl and (b) donor (C1 or C2) to Y6.
In order to get more information about the effect of incorporation of the BThIND-Cl as a guest acceptor on charge transport, the hole (μh) and electron (μe) mobilities in the binary and ternary active layers were assessed by using dark J–V characteristics of the hole only and electron only device and fitting the data with a space charge limited current (SCLC) model and are shown in Fig. S7 only for C2 based binary and ternary OSCs (ESI†). Similar trends in the J–V characteristics were also observed for C1-based devices. The μh and μe are about 1.45 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.04 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the C2:Y6 binary blend and 1.42 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 0.99 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the C1:Y6 binary blend, respectively, with a μh/μe ratio of 1.39 and 1.43 for C2:Y6 and C1:Y6. However, the μe and μh in C2 and C1 ternary active layers are increased to 1.36 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.51 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.32 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.48 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, resulting in a reduced μh/μe ratio of 1.11 and 1.14, indicating more balanced charge transport in the ternary active layer, justifying the larger values of JSC and FF for ternary OSCs.
Efficient OSCs require the synergistic contributions of photon absorption, charge separation, charge carrier transport and collection at electrodes and among these processes charge separation is very crucial. Both the HOMO offsets and LUMO offsets between donor and acceptors are considered to be the main reason for charge separation in OSCs. As the HOMO offset between the C2 and two acceptors is very small, we have investigated the exciton dissociation and charge collection probabilities of the binary and ternary active layers, employing the relationship between photocurrent density (Jph) and effective voltage (Veff) for the OSCs.63Jph is defined as Jph = JL − JD, where JL and JD are the current density of the devices under illumination and in the dark, respectively. Veff is expressed as Veff = V0 − Va, where, V0 is the voltage when Jph is zero and Va is the applied voltage. Veff decides the electric field at the D:A interface present in the blend films and therefore affects the exciton dissociation and charge transport performance. The variation of Jph with Veff is shown in Fig. 5. The Jph varies linearly with Veff at low values of Veff and then Jph reaches the saturation value (Jsat) at different values of Veff (in the range 1.1–1.4 V), suggesting that all the photogenerated carriers are extracted and collected with insignificant recombination. The Jph saturates at a lower value of Veff than binary counterparts, which is consistent with the improved values of JSC and FF for ternary blend based OSCs. The exciton dissociation probability (Pdiss) of the OSCs can be determined by Jph/Jsat under short circuit conditions and the values are 0.956, 0.964 and 0.983 for the C2:BThIND-Cl, C2:Y6 and C2:BThIND-Cl:Y6 based OSCs, respectively. The higher value of the Pdiss for the ternary device may be attributed to the better molecular packing and formation of an appropriate discontinuous network, enabling efficient charge transport with suppressed charge recombination. The value of the maximum exciton generation rate (Gmax) was estimated using Gmax = Jsat/qL, where q is the electronic charge and L is the thickness of the active layer (taken as 95 nm) and are about 1.00 × 1028 m−3 s−1, 1.16 × 1028 m−3 s−1 and 1.36 × 1028 m−3 s−1, for optimized C2:BThIND-Cl, C2:Y6 and C2:BThIND-Cl:Y6 based OSCs, respectively, which is consistent with the absorption profile of the active layer.

We have investigated the charge recombination processes in binary and ternary based devices via the dependence of JSC and VOC on illumination intensity (Pin) and shown in Fig. 5. The variation of JSC with Pin (Fig. 5b) follows the relationship JSC ∝ (Pin)α; α is the exponent reflecting degree of the bimolecular recombination. The values of α are 0.958, 0.964 and 0.984 for C2:BThIND-Cl, C2:Y6 and C2:BThIND-Cl:Y6 based devices, respectively. The increased value of the ternary based device signifies the suppression of the bimolecular recombination in this device. The variation of VOC with ln(Pin) is shown in Fig. 5c and follows the relationship VOC = (nkT/q)ln(Pin), where K is the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature, and q is electronic charge. In general, when the slope of VOCvs. ln(Pin) is close to kT/q the bimolecular recombination is dominated under open circuit conditions, whereas if the slope is larger than kT/q the trap-assisted monomolecular recombination is dominant. The values of the slope are 1.35kT/q, 1.28kT/q and 1.13kT/q, for C2:BThIND-Cl, C2:Y6 and C2:BThIND-Cl:Y6, respectively, indicating the effective suppression of trap-assisted recombination in the ternary based device.
The charge extraction information in the binary and ternary OSCs is investigated by transient photocurrent (TPC) under short circuit current conditions (Fig. 6) and the TPC curves were fitted with a mono-exponential model to estimate the charge extraction time. A similar trend was observed for C1 based binary and ternary devices. The charge extraction time for C2:BThIND-Cl, C2:Y6 and C2:BThIND-Cl:Y6 is 1.04, 0.98 and 0.81 μs, respectively. The shorter charge extraction time for the ternary device is in accord with the efficient charge sweep out over the binary counterparts, and also supports the reduced recombination losses. Transient photovoltage (TPV) analysis (Fig. 6, only shown for C2 based devices) was performed to acquire the information on the lifetime of the photogenerated charge carrier. The values of charge carrier lifetimes are 5.39, 5.58 and 6.12 μs for C2:BThIND-Cl, C2:Y6 and C2:BThIND-Cl:Y6, respectively. The longer carrier lifetime for the ternary based device than their binary counterpart also reflects the suppression of the charge recombination. These observations can clarify the improved JSC and FF in the ternary OSCs that suffer from lower recombination losses owing to the balanced charge transport and efficient exciton dissociation.

Molecular ordering and packing in the active layer are critical for attaining a high FF in OSCs.64 We performed XRD measurements of the optimized binary (C2:Y6) and ternary (C2:BThIND-Cl:Y6) films to study the influence of BThIND-Cl on the molecular packing properties of the ternary blend (Fig. 7). The binary blend showed a lamellar stacking (100) peak at 2θ = 5.14° with a crystal coherence length (CCL) of 4.67 nm and a π–π stacking (010) peak at 2θ = 23.76° with a CCL of 1.78 nm and a π–π stacking distance of 0.386 nm. The ternary film showed a similar (100) diffraction peak located at the same value of 2θ with an increased value of a lamellar CCL of 5.38 nm (increased intensity) but the (010) peak shifted to 2θ = 24.43° with a π–π stacking distance of 0.371 nm and a CCL of 2.54 nm. Therefore, in ternary films the molecular ordering is effectively enhanced due to the small π–π stacking distance, which is beneficial for the charge transport and FF enhancement.

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurement was performed to get information about the morphology and phase separation in the binary and ternary active layers which are shown in Fig. 8. The active layers showed bright and dark regions in the TEM images corresponding to the donor rich and acceptor rich domains, respectively due to the different electron densities between the donor and acceptor materials. It can be seen that the binary blend shows a well-defined fibrillar structure while the ternary blend shows more uniform bright and dark zones along with more evident fibrillar textures than the binary counterpart, indicating the better morphology and phase separation for achieving a higher FF value for ternary OSCs.

Conclusion
We have fabricated a series of fullerene free binary and ternary OSCs using wide bandgap small molecules C1 and C2 as donors and medium bandgap nonfullerene acceptor BThIND-Cl and narrow bandgap nonfullerene acceptor Y6. The newly synthesized small molecule C2 exhibits a deeper HOMO energy level as compared to C1, which is beneficial to obtain high VOC for the resulting OSCs. The OSCs based on the optimized C1:BThIND-Cl:Y6 and C2:BThIND-Cl:Y6 showed an overall PCE of 11.27% and 13.54%, respectively, which are higher than those of the binary counterparts using either BThIND-Cl or Y6 as the acceptor. The VOC of the ternary OSCs lies between that of the binary OSCs based on BThIND-Cl and Y6, which is consistent with the LUMO energy levels of Y6 and BThIND-Cl indicating the formation of an alloy-like composite between the two acceptors. The increase in the JSC for the ternary OSCs is related to the energy transfer from BThIND-Cl to Y6 which leads to effective utilization of the exciton through the energy transfer. The increase in the fill factor is related to the more balanced charge transfer and faster extraction of charge carriers and suppression of both bimolecular and trap assisted recombinations owing to the compact π–π stacking distance, enhanced crystallinity and improved phase separation in the ternary active layer. These results demonstrate that the combination of simple yet promising wide bandgap small molecule donors along with medium and narrow bandgap acceptors not only improves the overall PCE of all small molecule organic solar cells but also opens the door for their commercial applications with low cost.
