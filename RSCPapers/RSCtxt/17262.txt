    , Accepted 28th October 2014First published on 10th November 2014AbstractThis article describes the effect of manganese (Mn) doping in CdS to improve the photovoltaic performance of quantum dot sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs). The performances of the QDSSCs are examined in detail using a polysulfide electrolyte with a copper sulfide (CuS) counter electrode. Under the illumination of one sun (AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2), 10 molar% Mn-doped CdS QDSSCs exhibit a power conversion efficiency (η) of 2.85%, which is higher than the value of 2.11% obtained with bare CdS. The improved photovoltaic performance is due to the impurities from Mn2+ doping of CdS, which have an impact on the structure of the host material and decrease the surface roughness. The surface roughness and morphology of Mn-doped CdS nanoparticles can be characterised from atomic force microscopy images. Furthermore, the cell device based on the Mn-CdS electrode shows superior stability in the sulfide/polysulfide electrolyte in a working state for over 10 h, resulting in a highly reproducible performance, which is a serious challenge for the Mn-doped solar cell. Our finding provides an effective method for the fabrication of Mn-doped CdS QDs, which can pave the way to further improve the efficiency of future QDSSCs.
1. Introduction
Semiconductor quantum dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs) have drawn considerable attention as promising alternatives to dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) because of their unique opto-electronic properties.1–3 The attractive properties of semiconductor quantum dots include higher extinction coefficients,4 multiple exciton generation,5 direct hot carrier transfer,6 and tunable band gaps.7 Additionally, quantum dots (QDs) are cost-effective and easier to prepare than DSSCs. Normally, QDSSCs are composed of a wide-band-gap semiconductor electrode, a sensitizer, a redox electrolyte, and a counter electrode. The importance of the semiconductor electrode is to collect the photo-injected electrons from the sensitizer and to provide a better electron transport bridge between the sensitizer and the external circuit.
Mostly, QDSSCs employ mesoporous TiO2 as a wide-band-gap semiconductor layer on which QDs are attached for visible light absorption. So far, various kinds of semiconductor QDs have been widely studied for QDSSCs, such as CdS,8 CdSe,9 PbS,10 InP,11 and CdTe.12 In QD sensitizers, CdS and CdSe are the most efficient and widely used ones. In terms of energy level, CdS has a higher conduction band edge than titanium dioxide (TiO2), which allows electrons to move from CdS to TiO2 easily. On the other hand, the light absorption of CdS is limited to a short wavelength region because of its wide band gap (∼2.25 eV). In contrast, CdSe has a lower conduction band edge than TiO2, which obstructs electron migration from CdSe to TiO2, but CdSe can utilize a wide range of the visible spectrum. In addition, the combination of CdS/CdSe shows better performance because of a complementary effect, as well as light harvesting characteristic and re-organized step-wise band-edge levels.13,14 However, the efficiency of QDSSCs is still very low, which may be attributed to the difficulty in incorporating QDs into a TiO2 mesoporous matrix to obtain a well-covered QD monolayer on the inner surface of the TiO2 electrode.15 Other possible reasons include QD–electrolyte interfaces,16 electron loss occurring through charge recombination at the TiO2–electrolyte interface,17 and inner energy loss at the electrolyte–counter electrode (CE) interfaces.18
An improvement of the power conversion efficiency of QDSSCs might be realized through the use of bilayer electrodes, which involve sensitizing metal chalcogenides with infrared dyes.19,20 Other approaches include an efficient method of controlling the crystal size and size distribution of the QDs,21 modification of the intrinsic properties of semiconductor nanocrystals by introducing dopants,22 optimization of the QD-sensitized electrode, high coverage, integration of a suitable wide-band-gap matrix, and band alignment of the QDs, which will be favorable to both electron transfer and collection.23,24 It is possible to modify the electronic and photo-physical properties of QDs by doping with optically active transition metal ions such as Mn2+.25,26 By controlling the type and concentration of the dopant, it is possible to tune the electrical and optical properties of the semiconductor nanocrystals. In addition, the dopant creates electronic states in the midgap region of the QD, thus altering the charge separation and recombination dynamics.
The electrical, optical, and magnetic properties of CdS are strongly altered by doping with Mn2+, Fe2+, and Co2+, because of the sp–d exchange interaction between the localized d electrons of the transition metal magnetic ions and the mobile carriers in the conduction or valence band.27 The synthesis of Mn-doped CdS (Mn-CdS) has been proven to be a powerful strategy to extend the lifetime of charge carriers to boost the efficiency of CdS/CdSe co-sensitized QDSCs.28 The work of Kamat et al. on Mn-doped CdS photoanodes opens windows for research in exploring new materials and methodologies to achieve a high photovoltaic performance in QDSSCs.28 Under standard simulated AM 1.5 G (100 mW cm−2) illumination, a solar-cell-based CdS QD-sensitized TiO2 electrode can present a power conversion efficiency of 1.63%.28 Most importantly, by exchanging CdS with an Mn-CdS shell, the conversion efficiency of Mn-CdS QDSSCs has been further improved to 2.53%, which is one of the best results for CdS-based QDSSCs.28 Recently, Yu et al. reported Mn-doped CdS QDSSCs with a conversion efficiency of 1.19%.29 Such results motivated us to explore the optimization of Mn-doped CdS quantum dots to improve the photovoltaic performance of QDSSCs.
However, to the best of our knowledge, no systematic study has been performed for understanding the appropriate amount of Mn-doping in the photoanode which can improve the photovoltaic properties of QDSSCs. In the present work, the successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) method has been used to deposit QDs on the surface of TiO2. The morphological, optical, and structural properties of the resulting films are discussed to determine the better conditions. We report our attempt to fabricate QDSSCs by doping Mn in the photoanode (Mn-CdS). Without the passivation layer, we have achieved a promising photovoltaic conversion efficiency of 2.85%, which is considered to be rather high for CdS-based QDSSCs. The superior photovoltaic performance can be attributed to the doping of the appropriate amount of Mn in the electrodes.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Materials
Cadmium acetate dehydrate [Cd(CH3COO)2·2H2O], manganese(II) acetate tetrahydrate [Mn(CH3COO)2·4H2O], zinc acetate dehydrate [Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O], sodium sulfide (Na2S), sodium sulfite (Na2SO3), sulfur (S), potassium chloride (KCl), copper(II) sulfate pentahydrate [CuSO4·5H2O], sodium thiosulfate (Na2S2O3), urea (CH4N2O), and TiO2 paste (Ti-nanoxide HT/SP) were supplied by Solaronix. All other chemicals were commercially available and of analytical grade.
2.2 Fabrication of TiO2 photoanodes
Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO, 13 Ω sq−2, Hartford Glass Co. Inc.) glass was used as the substrates for the photoanode and the counter electrode. The TiO2 photoanodes were fabricated on the ultrasonically well-cleaned FTO substrate via the doctor blade method. 20 nm sized anatase TiO2 particles (Ti-nanoxide HT/SP, Solaronix) were first deposited on FTO substrates with an active area of 0.27 cm2, followed by sintering at 450 °C for 30 min. A thickness of 7.5 μm was obtained after solvent evaporation.30 The as-prepared TiO2 electrodes were used for further sensitization with CdS and Mn-CdS QDs.
2.3 Fabrication of CdS and Mn-CdS QDs
The SILAR method was used to assemble QDs on the TiO2 photoelectrode.31,32 In brief, for CdS QDs, the TiO2 film was dipped into an aqueous solution containing 0.1 M Cd(CH3COO)2·2H2O for 5 min to allow Cd2+ to adsorb onto the TiO2. It was then rinsed with DI water and dipped for another 5 min into an aqueous solution of 0.1 M Na2S, where the pre-adsorbed Cd2+ reacts with S2− to form the desired CdS. The film was rinsed again with DI water and dried with a drier. This two-step process is called a CBD cycle. To incorporate the doping of Mn2+, appropriate molar percentages of 5%, 10%, and 20% (5 mM, 10 mM and 20 mM) Mn(CH3COO)2·4H2O were mixed with Cd(CH3COO)2·2H2O. This enabled the co-adsorption of Mn2+ and Cd2+ ions, which in turn promoted the incorporation of Mn2+ into the CdS film.
2.4 Preparation of CuS and Pt counter electrodes
All chemicals used for the preparation of CuS and Mn-CuS thin films were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used without any further purification. Using the CBD method, it is simple and easy to prepare metal sulfide counter electrodes on the FTO substrate.33 Prior to deposition, the FTO samples were cleaned ultrasonically with acetone, ethanol, and DI water for 10 min each. The cleaned substrates were dried with N2 gas. The CuS aqueous solution was prepared using cationic and anionic precursors of 0.1 M CuSO4·5H2O and 0.4 M Na2S2O3, which act as sources of Co2+ and S2− ions, respectively. 0.4 M CH4N2O was used as a reagent for depositing CuS thin films. The substrate was then immersed horizontally into the growth solutions of CuS in a hot air oven at 65 °C for 2 hours. Finally, the CuS coated film (active area of ∼0.7 cm2) was washed several times with DI water and ethanol.
The cleaned FTO glass substrate was coated with Pt paste (Pt-catalyst T/SP, Solaronix) with an active area of ∼0.7 cm2 using the doctor blade method and sintered at 450 °C for 10 min.
2.5 Fabrication of solar cells
The as-prepared photoanodes and the counter electrodes were sealed using a 50 μm hot melt sealing sheet (double sheet of SX 1170-25, Solaronix). The internal space of the cells was filled by capillary action with a redox liquid electrolyte of 1 M Na2S, 2 M S, and 0.2 M KCl in DI water. The cells were left for a few hours for the complete diffusion of the electrolyte within the photoanode, and the cells were tested under ∼100 mW cm−2 illumination.
2.6 Characterization
The surface morphology, thickness, and elemental compositions of the electrodes were investigated using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, S-2400, Hitachi) equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscope (EDX) operated at 15 kV. QD adsorption was measured by UV-Vis spectroscopy (Mecasys, OPTIZEN 3220UV) over the wavelength range of 300–900 nm. The crystalline nature of the Mn-doped and undoped photoanodes and counter electrodes was analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD, D/Max-2400, Rigaku) using a Cu Kα source operated at 40 kV and 30 mA in the 2θ range of 20–80°. The current–voltage characteristics of the QDSSCs were studied under one-sun illumination (AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2) using an ABET Technologies (USA) solar simulator with an irradiance uniformity of ±3%. The surface roughness of the substrates (CdS and 10% Mn-CdS) prepared using SILAR (8 cycles) was characterized using an atomic force microscope (JPK NanoWizard II AFM, JPK Instruments, Berlin, Germany) with a scan rate of 0.8 Hz in contact mode. The internal resistance of the QDSSCs was measured at room temperature by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS; Biologic SP-150) under one-sun illumination (AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2) at frequencies ranging from 100 mHz to 500 kHz. The applied bias voltage and the AC amplitude were set to the Voc value of the QDSSCs and 10 mV, respectively. The electrical impedance was characterized using Nyquist and Bode plots.
3. Results and discussion
A schematic of the photoelectrical conversion configuration of a TiO2/Mn-CdS solar cell is shown in Fig. 1. The configuration of the solar cell consists of the anatase TiO2 film, Mn-CdS QD sensitizer, polysulfide redox couple, and FTO/CuS CE. As shown in the schematic diagram, photons are captured by QDs under illumination, yielding electron–hole pairs that are rapidly separated into electrons and holes at the interface between the nanocrystalline oxide and QDs. The electrons are injected into the TiO2 film, and the holes are simultaneously scavenged to the CE via the hole transporting redox couple of the polysulfide electrolyte.34

3.1 Morphology, structural and optical characterization of CdS and Mn-CdS on the surface of TiO2

Fig. 2 shows a scanning electron micrograph (SEM) of 8 SILAR deposition cycles of bare CdS and Mn-doped CdS QDs on a TiO2 surface. The surface morphology of a bare CdS electrode has a porous structure and thus renders a high surface area with uniform distribution of nanoparticles on the TiO2 surface. After the deposition of 5% Mn doped in CdS, the surface becomes more uniform upon ion exchange of Mn+2, similar to the bare CdS QDs but with large particle size, as shown in Fig. 2(b). The gaps between the nanoparticles were diminished by increasing the Mn concentration percentage, as shown in Fig. 2(c) and 2(d). 10% Mn-CdS demonstrates a porous interior with a large number of nanoparticles.

XRD analysis was used to find the crystallinity of the CdS and Mn-CdS films. Fig. 3 shows the X-ray diffraction patterns of bare, 5, 10, and 20% Mn-doped CdS films on TiO2. The QD-sensitized films were dried in air and analyzed without calcinations. The XRD patterns of pure TiO2 show that the peaks at 2θ values of 25.2°, 37.8°, 48.0°, and 68.7° correspond to the anatase TiO2 tetragonal structure (JCPDS card no. 00-021-1272). The triangle symbols in the figure represent the FTO glass substrate peaks. The remaining diffraction peaks are observed at 2θ = 26.5°, 44.0°, and 54.6°, which correspond to the [1 1 1], [2 2 0], and [2 2 2] planes of a CdS cubic structure (JCPDS card no. 01-080-0019). Although there was variation in the Mn concentrations, it did not affect the purity of the CdS films.

An EDX analysis was conducted to investigate the elemental compositions of CdS and Mn-CdS QD sensitizers on TiO2, and the results are shown in Fig. 4. The elements in the TiO2 were also detected due to the lower deposition of CdS QDs using the SILAR method. The EDX analysis shows the purity of the sample. There is no impurity observed in the sample, since there are no elements except for Ti, O, Cd, S, and Mn in the EDX spectrum. The Ti, O, Cd, S, and Mn orbital states are seen in the EDX spectrum. The film in Fig. 4(a) contains atomic percentages of 13% Cd and 12% S, indicating an atomic ratio of nearly 1:1 for Cd vs. S. Fig. 4(b) shows that upon ion exchange, 1% Mn content emerges in the film, while the Cd content drops from 13% to 12%, indicating the occurrence of ion exchange from Cd to Mn. The amount of dopants present in the Mn-CdS reveals that the Mn concentration increases with an increase in dopants. In Fig. 4(b)–(d), the energy levels of Mn at 0.650 keV, 5.89 keV, and 6.536 keV correspond to LIαβ, Kα, and Kαβ, respectively.

The SEM results indicate that only a tiny amount of CdS or Mn-CdS was assembled in the SILAR process, and the presence of these particles cannot be distinguished with the resolution of SEM analysis. However, the difference between the surfaces of CdS or Mn-CdS was identified using atomic force microscopy (AFM) images, as shown in Fig. 5. Fig. 5 shows the two-dimensional and the corresponding three-dimensional AFM images of the thin film surfaces of CdS and 10% Mn-CdS electrodes. The root mean square (RMS) surface roughness of the CdS and 10% Mn-CdS films in an area of 5 μm × 5 μm are 7.161 nm and 7.038 nm, respectively, as shown in Fig. 5(c) and 5(d). AFM studies indicated that the surface roughness of the 10% Mn-CdS film was smaller than that of the CdS film. The lower surface roughness is mainly due to the large particle sizes of Mn-CdS as compared with CdS nanostructures, which might be due to the lower radii of Mn than Cd. Thus, during the deposition of Mn-CdS by SILAR, some of the Mn ions are easily substituted by Mn-ions in CdS nanostructures. The power conversion efficiency of the CdS solar cell mainly depends on the small roughness of the CdS surface, and a reduction of the surface roughness in Mn-CdS tends to improve the conversion efficiency of the QDSSCs, which affects the optical properties.35

The UV-Vis absorption spectra of Mn-doped and undoped CdS QD-sensitized electrodes with 8 SILAR cycles are shown in Fig. 6. The absorption edge of the TiO2 photoanode appears at about 380 nm. The absorption onsets seen in these spectra at around ∼510, 515, 525, and 525 nm are characteristics of CdS, 5% Mn-CdS, 10% Mn-CdS, and 20% Mn-CdS, respectively. The band gaps of CdS and 10% Mn-CdS QDs were calculated to be 2.43 and 2.36 eV, which are higher than the value of bulk CdS (2.25 eV) due to the quantum size effect. This indicates that the size of the CdS and Mn-CdS on TiO2 is on the scale of QDs. The slightly enhanced absorption range of Mn-CdS compared to CdS could be ascribed to a slightly broader size distribution in the doped sample, which is caused by the incorporation of Mn into the crystal lattice of CdS.36 The higher amount of Mn doping did not improve the absorbance range of CdS, which means that the 20% Mn-CdS electrode absorption range is the same as that of the 10% Mn-CdS-sensitized electrode. This result indicates that the light absorption range can be improved with Mn doping in QDs and improve the QDSSC performance.

3.2 Photovoltaic performance of CdS and Mn-CdS cell devices
The deposition and optimization of CdS and Mn-CdS on the TiO2 surface were conducted using 10 SILAR deposition cycles. Sandwich-type thin layer cells were fabricated using FTO/TiO2/QDs as the photoanode, CuS as the cathode (the thicknesses of the film (691 nm) are shown in Fig. S1†), and a polysulfide electrolyte as the hole transporter. The current-density–voltage (J–V) curves of CdS and Mn-CdS were obtained under one-sun illumination (AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2). The photocurrent of the CdS and Mn-CdS electrodes changes a little with increasing SILAR cycles, which indicates that the high amount of CdS incorporated affects the absorbance of visible light and induces a higher current density. This also shows that the optimal SILAR number of cycles found for the CdS and Mn-CdS-sensitized TiO2 electrodes is about 8 (see Fig. S2 in the ESI†).
Comparative experiments demonstrate that Jsc increases continuously with increases in CdS and Mn-CdS up to 8 SILAR cycles. Further deposition cycles would decrease the overall power conversion efficiency, because the increased pore filling affects the electrolyte diffusion within the TiO2 film. The J–V curves of optimized CdS and Mn-CdS cells under AM 1.5 G illumination at one full sun intensity (100 mW cm−2) are shown in Fig. 7. The corresponding photovoltaic parameters of these cells like the open circuit potential (Voc), short-circuit current density (Jsc), fill factor (FF), and total energy conversion efficiency (η) are listed in Table 1. The QDSSC with an undoped photoanode exhibits a Voc of 0.614 V, a Jsc of 7.46 mA cm−2, an FF of 0.46, and an η of 2.11%. The Voc and FF of the QDSSCs with 5% Mn-CdS, 10% Mn-CdS, and 20% Mn-CdS photoanodes are slightly higher than those of the QDSSC with the CdS photoanode, resulting in higher η of 2.30%, 2.85%, and 2.40%, respectively.

The J–V curves were obtained under the illumination of one sun (AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2). Mn-doped and undoped CdS photoanodes with CuS CE were filled with a polysulfide electrolyte solution (1 M Na2S, 2 M S, and 0.1 M KCl).

In principle, Voc is calculated using the potential difference between the Fermi energy level, which is close to the conduction band edge position and the redox potential of the electrolyte. Therefore, it can be inferred that the pretreated interfacial doped buffer layers assisted in electron accumulation within the TiO2 photoanode, causing the Fermi level shift of TiO2 toward more negative potentials and resulting in higher photovoltage. A similar performance enhancement of a QDSSC photovoltaic device has been reported previously by Kamat et al., who used an Mn-CdS buffer layer to improve the photovoltaic performance of QDSSCs.28 For the film constructed with the Mn-CdS layer with the TiO2 photoanode, there is less contact area between the TiO2 surface and the electrolyte, which suppresses the recombination between the electron and oxidized ions (Sn2−) in the electrolyte. This leads to a high open voltage for the solar cell and can increase the electrons entering the electrolyte and recombining with holes therein. Notably, the Mn-CdS is beneficial for further improving the performance of QDSSCs with Jsc and FF.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis is used to investigate the details regarding the internal resistance, recombination properties, and charge transfer kinetics of QDSSCs.37 The Nyquist plots of QDSSCs with CdS and Mn-CdS photoanodes were measured under a simulated light source of 100 mW cm−2. The corresponding Nyquist plots for the frequency range of 100 mHz to 500 kHz are shown in Fig. 8(a). The plots were analyzed using Z-view software using an equivalent circuit, and the parameters obtained from the EIS analysis are summarized in Table 1. In the equivalent circuit, the series resistance (Rs) is the nonzero intercept on the real axis of the impedance plot, which denotes the sheet resistance of TCO and the contact resistance of FTO/TiO2. RCE is the electron transfer resistance at the interface of the CE/electrolyte, and Rct is the charge transfer resistance associated with electron recombination at the interface at the photoanode/electrolyte, which is parallel with the chemical capacitance (Cμ). Zw in the low frequency region is attributed to the Warburg impedance of the redox couple in the electrolyte.38
 Fig. 8  (a) EIS spectra and (b) Bode plots of QDSSCs based on CdS and Mn-doped CdS electrodes measured at 0.6 V bias potential in the frequency range 100 mHz–500 kHz. The equivalent circuit in (a) was simulated to fit the impedance spectroscopy. 
The result in Fig. 8(a) shows that the QDSSC fabricated using a 10% Mn-CdS photoanode exhibited the smallest charge transfer resistance Rct (9.35 Ω) and the highest chemical capacitance Cμ (7781 μF), indicating faster charge transport at the interface of TiO2/electrolyte/QDs. The undoped CdS leads to higher Rct (12.43 Ω) and the lowest Cμ (3971 μF), which indicates that there is less electron transfer at the TiO2/QD/electrolyte interface.39 The appropriate amount of Mn leads to an increased electron transfer rate and improved efficiency of the solar cells. Increasing Rct with an increase in Mn ions (20% Mn-CdS) leads to higher resistance (13.95 Ω) of the photoanode. At the same time, the reduced Cμ (3504 μF) indicates lower electron density with respect to the Mn ions. The corresponding Bode phase plots for cells with different configurations are shown in Fig. 8(b). The electron lifetimes (τr) can be obtained according to the following equation: τr = 1/(2πfmax),(1)where fmax is the maximum frequency of the middle-frequency peak in the Bode plot. The τr values of CdS, 5% Mn-CdS, 10% Mn-CdS, and 20% Mn-CdS were found to be 49.5, 33.7, 73.3, and 49.5 ms, respectively. The higher τr value of 10% Mn-CdS suggests that electrons have a longer lifetime and are effectively transferred, resulting in higher Jsc and energy conversion efficiency for the QDSSC.
3.3 Photo-stability of CdS and Mn-CdS electrodes in QDSSCs
Cell device stability is often overlooked, but it is crucial to any real application. The stability of the working state of CdS and 10% Mn-CdS photoanodes of QDSSCs with the CuS CE was measured in our work. Fig. 9 shows a comparison of the extracted photovoltaic parameters (Voc, Jsc, FF and η) of the CdS and Mn-doped CdS curves from stability tests for nearly 10 h. The devices were stored in air with ambient light illumination and without further encapsulation. The η values of the CdS photoanode declined continuously from 2.11% to 1.69% within 10 h, whereas the power conversion efficiency values of the 10% Mn-CdS photoanode decreased in the first 2 h from 2.85% to 2.29%, but excellent constant η values were maintained thereafter. The midgap states created by Mn doping cause electrons to get trapped and screen them from charge recombination with holes and the oxidized polysulfide electrolyte. Therefore, the spatial separation of electrons can be efficiently collected using an external circuit.28,40 In Mn-CdS, the enhanced photo-stability could be attributed to the efficient hole scavenging capability of the polysulfide electrolyte, which successfully suppresses hole-induced anodic corrosion. The reduced recombination could improve the photo-stability of the QDSSCs.

Improvements in the power conversion efficiency progressed even after Mn2+ doping because of the higher surface area. Efficient photoelectron supply from the CE reduces the rate of recombination and causes electron accumulation in the conduction band of TiO2, thereby increasing the Voc and Jsc. As a result, a PCE of 2.85% was obtained with the Mn-doped CdS electrode, which is higher than that of the bare CdS electrode based QDSSC (2.11%). The midgap states created by Mn2+ doping in CdS can improve the charge transfer at the electrolyte/QD interface and reduce the recombination with holes or the polysulfide electrolyte. From the results, we concluded that the performance of the QDSSC was improved by doping with an appropriate amount of Mn in the photoanode electrode material.
4. Conclusions
In summary, we have fabricated Mn-doped CdS QDs on the surface of TiO2 by the facile SILAR method. We obtained a detailed comparison between CdS and Mn-doped CdS photoanodes, which revealed that the Mn-CdS can be considered as an alternative photoanode to CdS in many applications, owing to its faster charge transport, more efficient charge separation, lower recombination resistance, and greater stability. A maximum of 8.77 mA cm−2 short circuit density and 2.85% conversion efficiency under one sun illumination has been achieved by doping 10% Mn in CdS/TiO2 QDSSC. The doping of CdS films with 10% Mn has enabled us to achieve nearly 25% improvement in power conversion efficiency as compared to undoped films (bare-CdS). This result confirms that the minimal amount of Mn ions in the CdS was very effective for improving the surface properties regarding both chemical stability and electronic surface state by reinforcing the surface network in QDSSCs. We believe that the QDSSC with an efficiency exceeding 6% can be achieved with the co-sensitization of longer absorption wavelength materials such as CdSe or PbS on the surface of Mn-doped CdS with the ZnS passivation layer.
