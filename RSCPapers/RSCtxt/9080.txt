    , Accepted 6th June 2018First published on 7th June 2018AbstractWe present an effective strategy to modulate the electron-deficiency of the π-bridged units in bis(4-methoxyphenyl)amine-based hole-transporting materials (HTMs) for improving hole mobility and the performances of perovskite solar cells (PSC) devices. In order to confirm this strategy, on the basis of the reported bis(4-methoxyphenyl)amine-based pDPA-DBTP, we adjusted the electron-deficiency of π-bridge units in pDPA-DBTP, and designed a series of new HTMs (S1–S3). Compared with the parent molecule pDPA-DBTP, the as-designed HTMs S1–S3 exhibit better performance with large Stokes shifts, small exciton binding energy, better stability, good solubility and higher hole mobility. The values of hole mobility for the molecules (S1–S3) are 1.07 × 10−2, 1.47 × 10−2 and 1.60 × 10−1 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. These results provide useful information and demonstrate that adjusting the electron-deficiency of π-bridge units in bis(4-methoxyphenyl)amine-based HTMs is an efficient approach to control the properties for improving the performance of HTMs in PSC applications. Moreover, the designed S1–S3 HTMs can act as promising candidates for providing high efficiency in PSC applications.
Introduction
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have emerged as very promising next generation solar cells due to their advantages of easy fabrication, low-cost and up to 22% of power conversion efficiency (PCE) in recent years.1–9 In the PSC device architectures, high efficiencies of PSCs have been achieved in an n–i–p-type “sandwiched” structure, which consists of a perovskite absorber placed between the electron transporting layer (ETL) and hole transporting layer (HTL).10 In these devices, the hole-transporting materials (HTMs) of HTL play the important roles of extraction of the holes from the light absorber and hole-transport toward the corresponding electrode for improvement of the PSC performance.11,12 It is well known that the typical 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) is still considered as the most successful HTM because of the excellent efficiency in PSC devices.3,13,14 However, the high cost and lengthy synthesis of spiro-OMeTAD limit its use in PSC application and commercialization.
To reduce cost and improve the performances of PSC devices, numerous efforts have been put into the development of alternative HTMs, including the conjugated small molecules and polymers.10 Although the PCEs have been greatly improved, there are a lot of challenges associated with the development of HTMs. For example, the hole mobilities of most HTMs, including spiro-OMeTAD, are small (∼10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1).6,15–17 Thus, the HTMs should be further improved to achieve high hole mobility. Generally, an ideal HTM requires a suitable highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level that matches with the valence band of the perovskite absorbers in order to provide sufficient driving force for charge extraction and efficient hole transfer between the perovskites and HTMs.11,17
The bis(4-methoxyphenyl)amine group applied as electron-donating arms have been widely used to construct hole transporting materials such as 4,4′-((1E,1′E)-(3,4-dimethoxythiophene-2,5-diyl)bis(ethene-2,1-diyl))bis(N,N-bis (4-methoxyphenyl)aniline) (Z26),18 4,4′,4′′,4′′′-(9-octylcarbazole-1,3,6,8-tetrayl)tetrakis(N,N-bis(4-methoxyphenyl) aniline) (CZ-TA),19 2′,7′-bis(bis(4-methoxyphenyl)amino)spiro[cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene-4,9′-fluorene] (FDT),20N′,N′,N′′,N′′-tetrakis(4-methoxyphenyl)spiro[fluorene-9,9′-xanthene]2,7-diamine (X59),21 pDPA-DBTP,22 S101,23 H101,24 and TTH101.25 The HTMs based on the bis(4-methoxyphenyl)amine group can yield interactions between the methoxy groups and the perovskite methylammonium sites at the interface of the HTMs/perovskite for improving the interfacial coupling.20 These HTMs based on bis(4-methoxyphenyl)amine units as arms and different electron-withdrawing π-bridged units in PSC applications exhibit different efficiencies.26 Distinctly, the electron-withdrawing π-bridged units are the key components that influence the performances of HTMs and the efficiencies of PSC devices. Therefore, investigating the influence of the electron-withdrawing π-bridged units on the performances of HTMs and the efficiencies of PSC devices is very important for designing highly efficient HTMs for reducing the cost and improving the performances of PSC devices.
In the present study, in order to investigate the influence of the electron-withdrawing π-bridged units on the performances of HTMs, a series of small molecules consisting of bis(4-methoxyphenyl)amine arms and different π-bridge units were designed (see the molecules S1–S3 in Fig. 1). Herein, the π-bridge units of the S1–S3 show high hole mobility in field-effect applications, which are 1.55 cm2 V−1 s−1, 7.9 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 3.0 cm2 V−1 s−1.27 The bis(4-methoxyphenyl)amine-based HTM of pDPA-DBTP (as shown in Fig. 1) reported by Lee et al. was selected as the parent molecule.22 The pDPA-DBTP material used in PSC applications shows good performance with high mobility of 3.1 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and dopant-free PCE of 14.10%.22 In addition, in order to provide reliable results, the theoretical calculation of the bis(4-methoxyphenyl)amine-based HTM (X59) reported by Hagfeldt et al.21 was selected as a reference. The X59 in PSC applications exhibit high mobility of 5.5 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and PCE of 19.8%.21 The chemical structure of the X59 molecule is presented in Fig. S1 (ESI†). In comparison with the pDPA-DBTP molecule, the electronic information, optical properties, hole mobility and molecular stability for the molecules S1–S3 as HTMs have been theoretically investigated by using density functional theory (DFT), time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) and Marcus theory in order to screen the excellent π-bridge units for constructing high-efficiency HTMs and explore the influence of the π-bridged units on the performances of the HTMs in PSC applications.

Computational methods
The ground-state geometries of the investigated molecules (Fig. 1) in their neutral and cationic states were fully optimized employing DFT with BHandHLYP at 6-31G(d) levels.28 All calculated geometries do not exhibit imaginary frequency, which ensure the lowest energy for all optimized structures. For the parental pDPA-DBTP, the calculated HOMO energy of −5.17 eV, which was obtained from the BHandHLYP/6-31G(d) calculation, very closely approach the experimental data (−5.05 eV22). In addition, the X59 molecule was tested by the BHandHLYP/6-31G(d) method and basis set. The calculated results indicated that the selected method and basis set can yield an accurate HOMO energy (−5.19 eV) in good agreement with its experiment value (−5.15 eV21). The TD-B3LYP/6-31G(d) method and basis set in toluene solution can yield a reliable absorption peak (398 nm) for X59, in line with the experimental value (387 nm21).28 Therefore, the absorption and emission properties of all the investigated molecules were calculated by TD-B3LYP/6-31G(d) functional and basis set on basis of the ground-state geometries with the same methods and basis set in toluene solution with the polarizable continuum model (PCM).28,29 In our previous study, the HOMO energy of the reported X59 were calculated by the functionals of B3LYP, CAM-B3LYP and HSE0330 at 6-31G(d) levels. The optical properties of the reported X59 were calculated by TD-DFT with different methods, namely, BHandHLYP and BMK methods, at 6-31G(d) levels in toluene solution. However, the HOMO energy and optical properties of the X59 on these functionals and basis set calculations significantly deviated from experimental data.31 The energy calculations of adiabatic ionization potential, electron affinities, absolute hardness, exciton binding energy and solvation free energy for the pDPA-DBTP and S1–S3 molecules were obtained from the B3LYP/6-31G(d) method and basis set in gas or toluene solution. All DFT and TD-DFT calculations were carried out using the Gaussian 09 program.32 The Crystal structures of the investigated molecules were simulated by the polymorphic module of the Material Studio software.33 The electronic coupling in hole transfer were calculated by the PW91/TZP functional and basis set in ADF program.34–37
Results and discussion
Electronic structure
The designed molecules (S1–S3) are presented in Fig. 1. The electronic properties of HTMs are associated with the performances of the PSCs. For PSCs, the HOMO energy not only reflects the hole-injection capacity, but also can have influence on the open-circuit voltage (Voc) of the PSC devices.11,38 This is because Voc has a connection with the difference between the HOMO energy of the HTMs and the quasi-Fermi levels of TiO2. Specifically, a small HOMO energy is beneficial for improving the Voc.11 On the basis of the BHandHLYP/6-31G(d) level, the HOMO energy of the designed molecules was further calculated, and the data are shown in Fig. 2a.
 Fig. 2  (a) The energy levels and frontier molecular orbitals of all the investigated molecules at the BHandHLYP/6-31G(d) level. (b) The linearity of LUMO energy between the theoretical calculations and experimental data. 
As shown in Fig. 2a, the values of the HOMO energy are in the order of pDPA-DBTP (−5.17 eV) > S3 (−5.24 eV) > S1 (−5.28 eV) > S2 (−5.32 eV). The HOMO levels of the investigated molecules are in good agreement with the valence band of CH3NH3PbI3 (−5.43 eV14,39). Moreover, in comparison with the pDPA-DBTP, the HOMO levels of molecules S1–S3 decreased by 0.11, 0.15 and 0.07 eV. Therefore, the HTMs of S1–S3 in PSC applications may yield large Voc values in the order of pDPA-DBTP < S3 < S1 < S2. The dihedral angles between the π-bridged cores and the benzene arms for each molecule of S1–S3 were counted. The average dihedral angles of S1–S3 are in the order of S3 (39.32 degree) < S1 (45.27 degree) < S2 (47.04 degree). Therefore, the HOMO energy in the order of S3 > S1 >S2 should be mainly influenced by the molecular planarity. In addition, as shown in Fig. 2a, the orbitals of all molecules exhibit the π characteristics. Both the π-bridge units and arms contribute to the densities on the HOMO, while the densities of the LUMO are mainly localized on the π-bridge units. It has been reported that good delocalization of the HOMO is favorable for hole transport.11,40 The high mobility of the HTM plays an important role in increasing the short-circuit current density and the filling factor of the PSC devices. According to the analysis of the HOMO distribution, S1–S3 may have high mobility, and they can be used as promising candidates for HTMs.
In this study, the method and basis set of BHandHLYP/6-31G(d) can yield a reliable HOMO energy for the investigated HTMs. However, the values of the LUMO energy for the HTMs from the BHandHLYP/6-31G(d) method and basis set calculations significantly deviate from the experimental data. Therefore, in order to obtain a more accurate LUMO level for the investigated HTMs, a class of bis(4-methoxyphenyl)amine-based HTMs was selected as references and theoretically investigated at the BHandHLYP/6-31G(d) level. These HTMs have lately been synthesized and used in PSC devices.18,20,21,24,41–46 An excellent correlation can be established between the theoretical LUMO energy levels (Lcal.) and the experimental LUMO energy levels (Lexp.) of the reported HTMs (in the Table S1 of ESI†). The empirical correlations between theoretical Lcal. and Lexp. for the selected HTMs are expressed in the following equation: L(exp.) = 0.98L(cal.) − 2.57 (R = 0.97)(1)As shown in Fig. 2b, these values have relatively good correlation coefficients (R = 0.97). According to the eqn (1), the calculated LUMO energy (−2.36 eV) of the parent pDPA-DBTP is very close to its experiment value (−2.25 eV22). Moreover, the calculated LUMO energy of −2.10 eV for the X59 molecule very much in line with the experiment data (−2.09 eV21). The calculated LUMO energies of S1–S3 are −2.43, −3.03 and −3.56 eV, respectively. In order to impede the electron transfer from absorber perovskite to the metal electrodes, the HTMs should have higher LUMO energy than the conduction band of perovskites (e.g. CH3NH3PbI3, −3.93 eV15).11 Clearly, the LUMOs of S1–S3 are highly compatible with the conduction band of perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 (see Fig. 2a). The calculated Egs are in the order of 2.85 eV (S1) > 2.29 eV (S2) > 1.68 eV (S3). The decreased energy gaps of molecules S1–S3 are mainly attributed to the downshifted LUMO. The electronic inductive effect of the π-bridge units may contribute to the lower LUMO levels and to the reduction of band gaps for S1–S3. This indicates that adjusting the π-bridged units of the investigated HTMs is a feasible way to control the energy levels in order to change the electron density of the molecular chain of HTMs.
Optical properties and exciton binding energy
The selected TD-B3LYP/6-31G(d) method and basis set in toluene solution can yield a reliable absorption peak (398 nm) of X59, which is in line with the experimental value (387 nm21). Therefore, the absorption and emission properties of all investigated molecules were calculated in toluene solution with TD-B3LYP/6-31G(d) functional and basis set on the basis of the ground-state geometries with the same methods and basis set. On the calculation of TD-B3LYP/6-31G(d) level in toluene solution, the absorption and emission wavelength of pDPA-DBTP are 422 and 479 nm, respectively. The absorption wavelengths (λabs), major configurations and emission wavelengths (λem) of molecules S1–S3 in S0–S1 states together with the Stokes shift are listed in Table 1, and the simulated absorption spectra are presented in Fig. 3a. As shown in Table 1, the λabs(f) for the molecules S1–S3 are 425 nm (1.49), 490 nm (1.39) and 591 nm (1.09) respectively. In the S0–S1 states, these absorptions are mainly derived from the HOMO → LUMO transitions.

(b) Electron density difference plots of electronic transition S0 → S1 for pDPA-DBTP and S1–S3 (isovalue: 4 × 10−2 e a.u.−3), Δq in e is transferred charge amount (|e−|). 
The values of λem for molecules pDPA-DBTP, X59 and S1–S3 are 479, 468, 500, 560 and 663 nm, respectively. In addition, Table 1 and Table S2 (ESI†) show that the emission wavelengths of the molecules pDPA-DBTP, X59 and S1–S3 exhibit large Stokes shifts in the order of pDPA-DBTP (57 nm) < X59 (70 nm) = S2 (70 nm) < S3 (72 nm) < S1 (75 nm). In general, large Stokes shifts of organic molecules can give an important indication that there is a large structural change between ground and excited states, which leads to good molecular flexibility of the excited state. The large Stokes shift would be synergistically beneficial in the infiltration and pore-filling of an HTM by simple annealing or light soaking post-treatment.24,47 Molecules S1–S3 have larger Stokes shifts, which are more beneficial to improve the performance of PSC applications.
In order to further study the charge transfer properties, the electron density difference plots of pDPA-DBTP and S1–S3 are presented in Fig. 3b. As shown in Fig. 3b, the electron density depletion (purple) and increment (blue) are primarily limited to the entire chains. As shown in Fig. 3b, the values of fraction of electron exchange (Δq) for pDPA-DBTP and S1–S3 are 0.86, 0.89, 0.85 and 0.66 (|e−|), respectively. The value of Δq for X59 is 0.83 |e−|, as shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). This indicates that adjusting the π-bridged units for the investigated HTMs is an important approach to influence the intramolecular charge transfer. In particular, the molecules S1 and S2 with large Δq are beneficial for charge separation, which may promote the application of HTMs in PSCs.
To achieve high hole transport ability, the bound electron–hole pairs should be dissociated into free charges to escape the Coulombic attractions such as exciton binding energy (Eb). For photoelectron materials, in order to achieve efficient charge dissociation, the Eb should be overcome. The Eb of the organic materials can be calculated from the following expression:48,49Eb = Eg − ETD, where the Eg is the energy offset between the LUMO and HOMO and the ETD represents an optical gap. As shown in Table S3 (ESI†), the values of Eb for pDPA-DBTP and X59 molecules are 0.46 and 0.50, respectively. As shown in Table 2, the HTMs of S1–S3 with small Eb (S1: 0.45 eV, S2: 0.37 eV and S3: 0.32 eV, respectively) in PSC applications can ensure that the electron–holes pair easily dissociate into free charges.

Solubility and stability of materials
The good solubility of HTMs plays a very important role in the production of PSC devices. In particular, the HTMs are coated on perovskite films. The solvation free energy (ΔG) represents the difference in free energy between molecules in the solvent and in the gap.50,51 As shown in Table 2 and Table S3 (ESI†), toluene was selected as the solvent, and the calculated ΔG is −5.93 kcal mol−1 for pDPA-DBTP, −5.79 kcal mol−1 for X59, −5.55 kcal mol−1 for S1, −5.64 kcal mol−1 for S2 and −6.69 kcal mol−1 for S3. It can be seen that the designed S1–S3 have commensurate solubility in comparison with that of pDPA-DBTP or X59.
Clearly, stability is the most basic performance of organic materials. Generally, the stability of the organic materials can be evaluated by absolute hardness (η) as follows:11η = (IP − EA)/2, where IP and EA are the adiabatic ionization potential and adiabatic electron affinity, respectively. According to Table 2 and Table S3 (ESI†), the calculated ηs of the molecules are in the order of pDPA-DBTP (2.69 eV) > X59 (2.62 eV) > S1 (2.53 eV) > S2 (2.26 eV) > S3 (1.97 eV). It can be seen that the absolute hardness values of the designed S1–S3 are less than those of pDPA-DBTP or X59, indicating that the designed molecule has better stability than the parental molecule.
Charge mobility
Charge transport ability is an important parameter in many optoelectronic devices. For example, Li et al.38 showed that the hole mobility of an HTM is very pivotal to increase the short circuit current density of the PSC device. In addition, our study shows that the hole mobility of the p-type donor materials may play a role in improving the short-circuit current density and fill factor of organic solar cells.52 According to the Marcus theory (eqn (S1) in ESI†), the reorganization energy (λ) and the transfer integral (v) are the main parameters that affect the charge transport rate (kCT) of HTMs.
The charge transport rate or hole mobility are affected by the reorganization energy, λ. In particular, a small recombination energy can contribute to large charge transfer rates or high hole mobility. As shown in Table 3, the calculated λ of molecules S1–S3 are 0.415, 0.345 and 0.329 eV, respectively. The λ shows the order of S1 > S2 > S3. This decreasing trend is inseparable from the π-conjugation length of π-bridged unit for the investigated HTMs to promote π-electron delocalization and the effective conjugate length of the molecule. Therefore, increasing the π-conjugation length of the π-bridged unit for these HTMs is a feasible way to increase the hole transfer rate or hole mobility.

For a good HTM, a large charge transfer integral, v, is conducive to improve charge transport rate or hole mobility (as shown in eqn (S1) (ESI†)). In the present study, the hole transfer integral (vh) is mainly researched for these molecules as HTMs in PSC applications. It is well known that the distribution patterns of frontier molecular orbitals and the intermolecular arrangement of neighboring molecules play a decisive role in determining v.53 In order to calculate the v of the investigated system, the relative positions of adjacent segments must be provided. In the current study, according to the statistics of the Cambridge Structural Database, the polymorphs are calculated to limit the eight most probable space groups: P21/c, P1, P212121, C2/c, P21, Pbca, Pna21 and CC.40 On the basis of the calculations, the obtained crystal structure with the lowest total energies for the pDPA-DBTP and S1–S3 belong to the space groups P212121, P212121, P212121 and Pbca, respectively. The predicted crystal structures are shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†) and crystal data are listed in Table S4 in the ESI.† We arbitrarily chose one molecule as the center in the crystal and took all its neighboring molecule as paired dimers. Each pair between neighboring molecules is defined as a transport pathway. The main pathways of S1–S3 are presented in Fig. 4. According to the predicted crystal structure of the pDPA-DBTP molecule, the data in Table S5 (ESI†) indicates that the calculated uh is 6.92 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is in good agreement with the experimental result (uh = 3.10 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1).22 The main pathways of pDPA-DBTP are presented in Fig. S4 (ESI†). In the same method and model, the calculated uh (4.39 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) of molecule X59 is larger by one order of magnitude than the experimental value (5.5 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1),21,31 which demonstrates that this study provided the method and model that are reliable for use in qualitative comparison between the experimental results and the theoretical data.
 Fig. 4  Main hole hopping pathways selected on basis of the crystal structures for all designed molecules. 
The hole transport rate in the Marcus equation can be simulated on the basis of the calculated hole recombination energy and the transfer integral in the main transport channel. According to the Einstein relation (eqn (S5), ESI†), the hole mobility of the investigated molecules can be obtained. Table 3 lists the reorganization energy (λh), the hole transfer integral (vh), hole transport rates (kh), center-of-mass distances (d) and hole mobility (uh) of the main hopping pathway on the basis of the predicted crystal structure of molecules S1–S3. Table 3 shows that the uhs of the molecules (S1–S3) are 1.07 × 10−2, 1.47 × 10−2 and 1.60 × 10−1 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively.
Compared with the calculated uh (6.92 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) of the pDPA-DBTP molecule, for the designed molecules (S1–S3), both the electronic coupling and small reorganization energy significantly contribute to the increase in hole transport rates. The hole reorganization energy of pDPA-DBTP and S1–S3 are 0.595, 0.415, 0.345 and 0.329 eV. The maximum electronic coupling energies in all pathways of the molecules pDPA-DBTP and S1–S3 are 9.35 × 10−3, 1.44 × 10−2, 1.44 × 10−2 and 1.39 × 10−1 eV, respectively. In comparison with the pDPA-DBTP, the increased electronic coupling of S1–S3 may be due to the influence of the π-bridge units with stronger electron-withdrawing ability. Clearly, the hole transport rates of the designed molecules S1–S3 are one or two orders of magnitude larger than that of pDPA-DBTP. Thus, in view of the hole-transport performances, the molecules S1–S3 as HTMs are promising candidates for providing high efficiency in PSC applications.
Conclusions
In summary, three simple bis(4-methoxyphenyl)amine-based HTMs were theoretically investigated by adjusting the electron-deficiency of π-bridge units for parallel comparison. The insights on the electronic structures, optical properties, reorganization energies, exciton binding energies and hole mobilities of the studied HTMs were provided by quantum-chemistry calculations combined with Marcus theory. The results indicated that the methods we used in this study could yield the reliable frontier molecular orbital energy, absorption peak and hole mobility of the reported HTMs (e.g. pDPA-DBTP and X59), in line with the experimental results. In comparison with the parent molecule pDPA-DBTP, the designed HTMs S1–S3 exhibit better performance with large Stokes shifts, small exciton binding energy, better stability, good solubility and higher hole mobility. The values of hole mobility for the molecules S1–S3 are 1.07 × 10−2, 1.47 × 10−2 and 1.60 × 10−1 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. Therefore, the designed S1–S3 HTMs can act as promising candidates for providing high efficiency in PSC applications. These results provide useful information, and indicate that adjusting the electron-deficiency of π-bridge units in bis(4-methoxyphenyl)amine-based HTMs is an efficient approach to control the properties for improving the performance of HTMs in PSC applications.
