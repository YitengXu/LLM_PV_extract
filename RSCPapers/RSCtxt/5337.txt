    , Accepted 17th March 2023First published on 5th April 2023AbstractDirect hydrogenation of CO2 to ethanol is a highly economical carbon reduction strategy. However, the CO2 hydrogenation process traditionally requires high temperatures, typically higher than 300 °C, to activate CO2 molecules, which is unfavorable to the formation of ethanol. In contrast, we applied the novel non-thermal plasma to activate CO2 at ambient conditions and a Cu(I)-MOF catalyst to selectively synthesize ethanol for the selective transformation of CO2 into ethanol. The best catalyst, Cu(I)-HKUST-17.5, achieved 41.2% CO2 conversion and up to 62.9% ethanol selectivity under ambient conditions. The control experiments indicated that the Cu(I) sites are key to realizing C–C coupling and ethanol synthesis. An unreported synergistic catalytic mechanism between non thermal plasma and the Cu(I) and Cu(II) sites on the catalyst is proposed based on the DRIFTS analysis. Overall, our work confirms the feasibility of utilizing non thermal plasma assisted catalysis for the selective conversion of CO2 to ethanol under mild conditions.
1. Introduction
Fossil fuels are one of the most essential energy sources, accounting for more than 80% of the global energy supply while also being the largest source of global CO2 emissions.1 The global average atmospheric carbon dioxide in 2020 reached 412 parts per million (ppm), representing a new record high despite the economic slowdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.2 The greatly increased CO2 concentration in the atmosphere amplifies the block magnitude of the greenhouse effect, which in turn escalates public concerns about global warming. Carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) is an important way of emission reduction technology that plays an essential role in the transition to a net-zero economy.3 CO2 can be converted into a wide range of marketable products, including synthetic fuels, chemicals, polymers and many other materials. Being an essential chemical building block, methanol has received much attention from researchers and has been synthesized using CO2 as a feedstock.4 When compared to methanol, ethanol is not only an ideal liquid fuel with a higher energy density (26.8 MJ kg−1) but also a superior intermediate in chemical synthesis processes that can be easily converted into high-value products such as ethylene and acetaldehyde.5 In addition, ethanol is also widely used as a medical disinfectant and gasoline additive.6 The current market shows a rapidly growing demand for ethanol. Traditionally, ethanol is produced via the fermentation of sugar or starch-rich crops, which leads to competition with edible food.7 Using readily available and renewable H2 and CO2 as a feedstock is obviously a more attractive route. However, the direct transformation of CO2 to ethanol is difficult due to the chemical inertness of CO2. Yang et al. developed a RhFeLi/TiO2 catalyst that achieved 15.0% CO2 conversion and 32.0% ethanol selectivity at 250 °C and 3 MPa,8 while Xu et al. reported a Cs-promoted Cu–Fe–Zn catalyst that realized 23.7% CO2 conversion and 14.3% C2+ alcohol selectivity at 310 °C and 5 MPa.9 It is noted that the conversion of CO2 tends to be inversely proportional to the selective production of alcohols, which is limited by the CO2 hydrogenation route.
The most accepted route for turning CO2 into ethanol currently is a stepwise approach, beginning with CO2 hydrogenation of a key intermediate CH2O, followed by the C–C coupling reaction involving a second carbon source that could either be CO (formed via the water–gas shift reaction) or  (formed via dissociation of methanol intermediate). Both reaction steps, however, require an effective multifunctional catalyst in order to accomplish the hydrogenation and carbon coupling processes simultaneously.10 In addition, the high temperatures required to activate CO2 in thermal catalysis may trigger carbon deposition, sintering of catalysts and even catalyst degradation.11 The critical issue is that the hydrogenation of CO2 to ethanol is a typical exothermic reaction (ΔH(298K)Θ = −173.7 kJ mol−1), meaning that lowering the reaction temperature is thermodynamically advantageous.12 However, CO2 is well-known for its stability (standard Gibbs free energy of formation of CO2 is −394.4 kJ mol−1) due to the robust linear CO bond structure.13 High temperatures (>300 °C) are, therefore, required to effectively activate the CO2 molecule.12 These contradictory requirements posed a great challenge to the direct synthesis of ethanol from CO2via thermal catalysis. To overcome the limitations, the development of efficient catalysts and innovative catalytic systems that can realize CO2-to-ethanol production under milder conditions is extremely important. Of all catalytic sites, the copper metal site has demonstrated the most potential for producing alcohols, as its moderate CO binding energy encourages the production of a wide range of hydrocarbon products, such as methane, methanol, ethylene and ethanol.14 Its proper binding energy for most reaction intermediates also reduces the selectivity for a particular product. Recent studies have confirmed that monovalent copper (Cu(I)) can act as a more effective stabilizer of methoxy and acyl species when compared to zero-valent copper (Cu(0)). It plays an important role in creating a rich CH2O* environment, which is an essential intermediate in the formation of a C–C coupling.15
Cu(I)-based catalysts can be obtained by reducing divalent copper precursors impregnated on the carriers (e.g., SiO2, metal oxides, etc.) at high temperatures, typically around 550 °C, under an N2 atmosphere. However, this method of reduction results in lower Cu(I) yields and can cause irretrievable aggregation of copper species during the reduction process. Temperature-sensitive materials should not be reduced using the high-temperature reduction method.16 A promising solution for this limitation may involve the use of pre-formation strategies and restricted coordination of metal sites. Nachtigallová et al. investigated the interaction between coordinated O atoms on the ZSM-5 backbone and Cu(II) ions to find a way to prevent possible aggregation from occurring during the reduction of Cu(II) species.17 Similarly, Xue et al. used N sites on polyacrylonitrile-treated carbon fibers to limit the migration of copper species during reduction.18
Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) are an attractive candidate that can be used to accomplish the aforementioned strategy due to their unique metal–ligand self-assembly mode, which ensures that the metal node confined by the backbone remains highly dispersed and stable after reduction.19 Moreover, MOF materials are attracting interest as promising novel porous catalysts due to their tunable structure, extremely large specific surface area, and accessible open metal sites. These properties can effectively promote the diffusion of feed gas, intermediates and products around the active metal during the CO2 hydrogenation process.20 HKUST-1 is chosen as the raw material for our expected Cu(I)-MOF catalyst due to its abundant copper source (up to 30 wt% copper per unit mass),21 and its proven feasibility in constructing hierarchical pores and highly dispersed Cu(I) sites by controlled reduction.22 Unfortunately, the unsaturated coordination pattern between the metal node and the ligand on HKUST-1 affects its structural stability to high temperature and moisture, thus limiting its application in thermal catalysis.
Non-thermal plasma (NTP) catalysis has shown great promise for achieving CO2 hydrogenation at ambient temperatures and pressure.23 It is an effective tool for activating stable CO2 and H2, and features a pronounced non-equilibrium process, allowing for the activation of feed gases and subsequent reactions to take place at low temperatures.24 The NTP catalytic system promises to solve the two aforementioned dilemmas that occur in conventional catalysis: (a) the thermodynamic conflicts and (b) the application limitations of Cu(I)-MOF in thermal catalysis.25,26 Specifically, the NTP catalytic process can be divided into a NTP reaction section and a catalyst reaction section. The NTP reaction section can generate numerous high-energy electrons (average electron energy of 1–10 eV) in a discharge zone at both room temperature and atmospheric pressure, which is the optimal range for exciting molecules as well as breaking chemical bonds. As to CO2, NTP also provides enough energy to break the robust CO bond (the standard reaction enthalpy of CO2 dissociation is only 2.9 eV) and thereby generate various highly reactive species (e.g., CO2− and CO) under ambient conditions. The interaction among these reactive species produced from the plasma reaction then allows CO2 conversion to occur without the harsh conditions necessary for a thermocatalytic process.24,27 In addition, the milder reaction conditions of plasma catalysis significantly reduce the carbon deposition and sintering of the catalyst observed in conventional thermal catalysis, thereby extending catalyst lifetime. However, the exceptional excitation capacity of NTP generates versatile intermediates that would lead to low selectivity of a desired product. The introduction of the catalyst surface reaction section is, therefore, encouraged to purposefully induce the reaction pathway and enhance the selectivity of the product.
In this work, we have modified a typical Cu(II) metal node containing MOF material, HKUST-1, using classical reductive vapor treatment (RVT) at 200 °C to obtain a novel MOF-based catalyst with uniformly dispersed Cu(I) and Cu(II) sites called Cu(I)-HKUST. Methanol was chosen as a suitable reducing agent, as its weaker reduction capacity ensures that HKUST-1 maintains a porous framework structure during metal valence modulation. The coupled catalytic system of NTP and Cu(I)-HKUST was investigated in a water-cooled DBD plasma reactor and showed excellent catalytic results, as 41.2% of CO2 was directly hydrogenated to ethanol with excellent selectivity (62.9%) at 35 °C and ambient pressure.
2. Experimental
2.1 Chemicals
Copper nitrate hydrate, 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid (1,3,5-BTC), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), anhydrous ethanol, and methanol (HPLC) were obtained from Aladdin Co., Ltd. Deionized water was generated using a Milli-Q water purification system. In this work, methanol, ethanol and isopropanol are abbreviated as MeOH, EtOH and IPA, respectively.
2.2 Catalyst characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of catalysts were obtained via a Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer equipped with Cu Kα radiation in the 2θ range from 3° to 60°. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed using an ESCALAB 250Xi spectrometer. The Fourier transform infrared spectrum (FT-IR) measurement was carried out on a Nicolet 510P FT-IR absorption spectrometer in a range of 400–4000 cm−1. The surface morphology (SEM) was detected using a Hitachi S-4800 model device. The pore size distribution of the catalysts was analyzed using an ASAP 2020 Plus physisorption. The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms and the heat of CO2 adsorption were analyzed using an ASAP2020 Plus physisorption.
2.3 Synthesis of HKUST-1
HKUST-1 was synthesized by following a classical hydrothermal method based on the reported procedures.28 Specifically, BTC (5 mmol) was dissolved in a mixed solution that contained anhydrous ethanol (15 mL) and DMF (15 mL). Copper nitrate hydrate (9 mmol) was dissolved in deionized water (15 mL), which was then added to the above solution and transferred to a 100 mL Teflon autoclave kept at 100 °C for 12 hours. Next, it was cooled to room temperature, and the blue crystals were filtered, which were then subjected to the DMF and ethanol solvent for 24 hours to remove any unreacted chemicals. The derived solids were dried at 80 °C to obtain the expected HKUST-1.
2.4 Reduction of Cu(I)-HKUST-n via RVT
Cu-HKUST-n was prepared using the reported method.22 0.15 g of HKUST-1 was transferred to a quartz urn inside the Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave (100 mL in capacity), containing 20 mL of CH3OH at the bottom in order to prevent direct contact between the solid and CH3OH. The autoclave was heated to 200 °C and maintained at that temperature for the pre-set length of time. Subsequently, the autoclave was rapidly cooled to room temperature, and the powder was quickly deposited into a flask and vacuumed to remove the residual CH3OH. The obtained samples are denoted as Cu(I)-HKUST-n, where n is the treatment time that varied from 0 to 27.5 hours.
2.5 NTP-assisted CO2 hydrogenation
The NTP–catalyst coupling system developed for CO2 hydrogenation was operated in a DBD reactor with circulated cooling water (Nanjing Suman Electronics Co., Ltd., China) at room temperature and atmospheric pressure (Scheme 1). A 2 mm (o.d.) stainless steel rod was used as a high-voltage electrode and was placed inside a quartz reactor tube (12 mm o.d. × 8 mm i.d.). The plasma discharge zone, which possessed a 50 mm discharge length and a 3 mm discharge gap, was wrapped with a coaxial condensate sleeve. The circulating cooling water flowing through the sleeve served as a ground electrode and an efficient heat dissipation medium. The quartz tube wall separating the cooling water and the stainless-steel rod (high-voltage electrode) acts as a dielectric barrier to achieving an effective plasma discharge. This design has been proven to be effective in removing heat buildup in the discharge section and for facilitating the exothermic reaction.26 In the catalytic test, 0.5 g of the catalyst was fully packed into the discharge zone, and the feed gas (H2:CO2 = 3:1) entered the DBD reactor at a total flow rate of 30 mL min−1 (i.e., the volume space velocity is 3.53 min−1) to engage in the reaction. The 30 volts AC high voltage power was supplied to the plasma generator as an input voltage, which was then amplified to 24 kilovolts (defined as the applied voltage) by the plasma generator and applied to the DBD reactor to trigger the non-thermal plasma at a frequency of 9 kHz. The electrical parameters of plasma were monitored using an oscilloscope (Tektronix TBS1072B), which was connected to the reactor via a dedicated high-voltage probe (Tektronix P6015).

The gaseous products were analyzed using a gas chromatograph (Shimadzu GC-2014) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). A collection tube submerged in an ice isopropanol–water mixture (−10 °C) was connected to the DBD reaction outlet to condense the liquid product, which was analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and GC, respectively. The total flow of gas products was measured using a soap-film flow meter. The calculations of CO2 (XCO2) conversion, the selectivity and yield of gaseous products (CH4 and CO) and liquid products (methanol, ethanol and isopropanol) along with the carbon balance (CB) and space-time yield (STY) are shown in the attached ESI.†
2.6 
          In situ DRIFTS characterisation of NTP-activated CO2 hydrogenation

In situ DRIFTS was performed in a customer-made ZnSe detection cell. H2 and CO2 were continuously fed into the cell (flow ratio: 3:1) at a rate of 10 mL min−1. The plasma operating parameters for the input voltage and input current were 50 V and 0.7 A, respectively (the input power was consistent with the actual catalytic process). The IR spectra were recorded every 5 minutes at a resolution of 4 cm−1 and analyzed using OPUS software.
3. Results
3.1 Catalyst characterization
The effect of the RVT duration on the crystal structure of our MOF-based catalyst was investigated by examining X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns (Fig. 1a). It was confirmed that the pristine HKUST-1 possesses a face-centered cubic crystal lattice (as shown in Fig. 2), with typical peaks at 2θ = 6.5° {200}, 9.5° {220} and 11.5° {222}, which is in agreement with the findings in a previously published work.29 The RVT-treated Cu(I)-HKUST-n also retains the same diffraction peaks as HKUST-1, although the intensity was slightly reduced, suggesting that the methanol vapor gradually decarboxylated HKUST-1 to obtain the Cu(I) sites, while the primary crystalline integrity was maintained. Since the electronic state of the active phase is a critical factor influencing catalytic behavior, X-ray photoelectron spectrum (XPS) analyses of Cu(I)-HKUST-n were performed to investigate the effect of the reduction duration on the electronic state of Cu species in HKUST-1 (Fig. 1b). The characteristic peak at 934.8 eV was identified as Cu(II) ions (shaded in blue), while Cu(I) was found at 932.6 eV (shaded in purple).30,31 We can clearly see that most of the copper species in a fresh HKUST-1 (prior to RVT treatment) are present in the form of Cu(II) ions, as only 5.84% of incompletely coordinated copper species were present in a monovalent state, which is consistent with the results discussed in the literature.32 The number of the Cu(I) species increases linearly with the extension of the RVT reduction duration from 7.5 hours to 27.5 hours with a step of five hours, transforming from Cu(I)-HKUST-7.5 with 16.75% of Cu(I) to Cu(I)-HKUST-27.5 with 48.79% of Cu(I). The gradation of the sample color from the sky blue of the HKUST-1 to the dark green of Cu(I)-HKUST-27.5 observed in the optical microscope image (Fig. S1†) also supports the notion that the formation of the Cu(I) site is closely associated with the impact of RVT treatment.

 Fig. 2  SEM images of (a and a′) HKUST-1 and (b–f and b′–f′) Cu(I)-HKUST-n (n = 7.5, 12.5, 17.5, 22.5, and 27.5, respectively). 
To further explore the variations in the coordination environment of HKUST-1 caused by the switch from divalent to monovalent copper sites, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) was used to analyze a series of Cu(I)-HKUST-n catalysts. As can be observed from Fig. 1c, the peak centered at 1640 cm−1 (peak a) represents the asymmetric stretching of COO−, while the characteristic bands of the symmetric stretching of COO− were observed at 1450 cm−1 and 1370 cm−1 (peaks c and d). The impact of the stretching vibration of the H–O bond on the carboxylic group present in the 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid (BTC) was identified at 1570 cm−1 (peak b).33 Longer RVT treatment duration boosted the growth of “peak b”, suggesting the appearance of more non-coordinated ligands (BTC). This observation confirmed that the reduction process was accompanied by dissociating the ligand of the HKUST-1 framework structure to expose more free carboxylic groups (peak b). As a matter of fact, this dissociation is necessary to achieve the valence alteration (from divalent to monovalent copper) of the metal node on HKUST-1. Only when the coordination mode between the ligands and the metal nodes shifts from a saturated to unsaturated coordination, the accessible sites of copper can be vacated to facilitate the adsorption of methanol at the Cu(II) nodes and the subsequent reduction reaction.
MOF materials rely on the self-assembly of organic ligands and metal nodes to form porous frameworks. It is, therefore, necessary to investigate the structural changes caused by ligand dissociation. The N2 adsorption–desorption test of HKUST-1 and Cu(I)-HKUST-n was first conducted at 77 K. The pore size distribution of the catalysts is displayed in Fig. 1d. The initial HKUST-1 possesses micropores with pore sizes of 7 Å and 8 Å, which facilitates the diffusion of the feedstock gases (CO2 and H2 having molecular diameters of 3.3 and 2.9 Å, respectively) within the MOF pores and the interaction with the open copper sites on the MOF framework. The RVT reduction created mesopores in the structure of HKUST-1. The mesopores sized at 28 Å were observed when the RVT treatment duration reached 12.5 hours. As the reduction time increases, the pore size grows. After 27.5 hours of reduction, pores of 40 Å become dominant. The adsorption isotherms of the catalysts (from HKUST-1 to Cu(I)-HKUST-27.5, Fig. S2†) support the appearance of mesopores, which gradually shifted from type I to type IV with a noticeable desorption hysteresis. Moreover, there are weak signals between 450 Å and 2000 Å, attributed to the voids between the catalyst particles. The voids provide the space for the plasma discharge. This observation evidences that the RVT treatment has weakened the framework structure of HKUST-1 during the reduction from Cu(II) to Cu(I) sites. Because the porous framework structure is constructed by the interlocking combination of metal nodes and ligands, the pore size of MOF materials is well-defined and regular.34 When the intact ligand link at the metal nodes is dissociated due to RVT treatment, defective vacancies in the structure are formed. Interestingly, the formation of such defective vacancies displays aggregation behavior, meaning that the dissociation of organic ligands tends to occur near the regions where defective vacancies are already present. The increased mean pore size of mesopores shown in Fig. 1d confirms the presence of this aggregated reduction.
The presence of defective vacancies can also be visually evidenced by scanning electron microscope (SEM) images. As shown in Fig. 2, the catalyst particle size is around 8–12 μm. The defective holes gradually increase on the MOF surface with the increase of reduction duration, especially for Cu(I)-HKUST-22.5 and 27.5 (Fig. 2e and f), where multilayer and large holes can be clearly observed. The growth of defective holes observed in SEM images is consistent with the ideas on ligand dissociation derived from the FT-IR spectra and pore size distributions. As discussed previously, the presence of Cu(I) sites requires the dissociation of coordination between metal nodes and organic ligands, implying that those sacrifices have been made to the structural stability of the MOFs. The element mapping (Fig. S3†) demonstrates that copper elements are uniformly dispersed throughout the sample, suggesting that copper ions did not aggregate throughout the reduction process. The thermogravimetry (TG) and derivative thermogravimetry (DTG) results (Fig. S4†) proved that the decomposition temperature of the catalyst decreases (from 350 °C to 310 °C) as the RVT treatment time is prolonged. Fortunately, our non-thermal plasma catalytic system is stabilized at the reaction temperature of around 35 °C and well below the confirmed dissociation temperature, while ensuring the stable operation of the catalyst (Fig. 5d).
3.2 Catalytic performance
The catalytic performance of HKUST-1 and Cu(I)-HKUST-n in NTP-assisted CO2 hydrogenation was investigated using the DBD plasma reaction system under 35 °C and atmospheric pressure (Fig. 3). First, the CO2 conversion rates with packed and unpacked catalysts are compared. It is noted in Fig. 3a that, without the involvement of the catalyst, only 12.0 mol% of CO2 was converted. As soon as catalysts were packed into the DBD reactor, the CO2 conversion rate doubled or tripled. The catalysts Cu(I)-HKUST-12.5 and Cu(I)-HKUST-17.5 generated the best rates of CO2 conversion, reaching 43.2% and 41.2%, respectively.
 Fig. 3  (a) CO2 conversion and (b) selectivity of NTP-assisted CO2 hydrogenation over different catalysts. Reaction condition: 35 °C, atmospheric pressure, a volume space velocity of 3.53 min−1, a H2/CO2 flow ratio of 3:1, 0.5 g catalyst, an input voltage of 30 V and reaction time of 2 hours. 

Fig. 3b demonstrates the product distribution with or without catalysts. When CO2 was subjected to only non-thermal plasma (without the presence of a catalyst), gaseous products dominated with about 6.1% methanol (MeOH) being gained. Neither ethanol (EtOH) nor isopropanol (IPA) was detected. The collected gas product consists of CO and CH4, accounting for 77.6% and 16.2% of the overall products, respectively. When a catalyst was placed in the NTP discharge zone, liquid products (including MeOH, EtOH and IPA) became increased significantly, which is a desirable result. As the untreated feedstock, HKUST-1 primarily produced methanol, whose selectivity reached as high as 23.9%. As the length of RVT treatment was extended, the ratio of Cu(I) sites (RCu(I)) on the catalyst continued to rise (Table 1), accompanied by the increased production of the targeted alcohol product. The best ethanol selectivity (62.9%) was also achieved using Cu(I)-HKUST-17.5. Nevertheless, Cu(I)-HKUST-22.5 and Cu(I)-HKUST-27.5, which have a higher Cu(I) content than Cu(I)-HKUST-17.5, showed a lower ethanol selectivity of 51.2% and 43.4%, respectively. A similar trend can be more visually observed in the ethanol yield (Table 1), which displays a typical volcano-like distribution, with the highest ethanol yield being achieved by Cu(I)-HKUST-17.5, where 25.9% of input carbon was transformed into ethanol. A possible inference is that RCu(I) is the main driver of producing liquid organics with longer carbon chains, but this promotion is not unlimited and may be subject to other factors in the catalytic environment, which will be deliberated further in the Discussion section. Table 1 also lists the calculated energy efficiencies based on CO2 (EECO2) for the non-thermal plasma catalytic system packed with different catalysts. The highest EECO2 was obtained with Cu(I)-HKUST-12.5 and Cu(I)-HKUST-17.5 at 0.28 and 0.27 mmol kJ−1, respectively. Considering all the above properties, Cu(I)-HKUST-17.5 was chosen as the best catalyst, as it was able to convert up to 41.2% of CO2 into various gas and liquid products while also demonstrating excellent selectivity and yield of ethanol, achieving 62.9% and 25.9%, respectively.

Fig. 4 shows a typical example of the time evolutions of both the applied voltage and the discharge current with and without catalysts at a fixed input voltage of 30 V and an input frequency of 9 kHz. In the absence of a catalyst, the peak–peak voltage of plasma discharge is identified as 24 kV based on the voltage signal (purple line), while the current appears to have two components, one being a sine in the quadrature phase of the current and the other one being the impulse current with a magnitude of up to 89 mA (Fig. 4a). The patterns suggest that the DBD plasma exhibits typical filamentary micro-discharge behavior.35 Interestingly, the introduction of catalyst particles (Cu(I)-HKUST-17.5) significantly attenuated the pulse currents and amplified the intensity of the sine voltage and current, suggesting that the catalyst strengthened the power density of the discharge, which is confirmed by the increased area of the Lissajous figure (Fig. 4b). The presence of catalysts suppressed filamentary micro-discharge and encouraged catalyst surface discharge. The volume power density tripled when catalyst particles were packed in the DBD reactor, increasing from 13.15 W cm−3 to 40.68 W cm−3, but no significant carbon deposition was observed. The carbon balance reached 96.6% (as shown in Table S1†).
 Fig. 4  (a) Time evolutions of applied voltage and discharge current and (b) Lissajous figure of NTP-assisted CO2 hydrogenation with and without catalysts. Reaction condition: 35 °C, atmospheric pressure, a volume space velocity of 3.53 min−1, a H2/CO2 flow ratio of 3:1, 0.5 g catalyst, an input voltage of 30 V and reaction time of 2 hours. 
The operating parameters of the NTP catalytic system with Cu(I)-HKUST-17.5 were investigated, including volume space velocity, feed gas ratio, and plasma discharge frequency. Fig. 5a shows the effects of the volume space velocity of the feed gas (H2 and CO2). As the volume space velocity increased from 3.53 min−1 to 8.24 min−1, CO2 conversion dropped from 40.6% to 11.7% and the selectivity of ethanol decreased from 62.2% to 28.0%, while the space-time yield of ethanol (STYEtOH) also decreased from 0.20 to 0.03 gEtOH h−1 gcat.−1. The increasing volume space velocity inevitably significantly reduces the residence time of the reactants in the reactor, resulting in reduced opportunity for the feed gas to be effectively dissociated and participate in the reaction. Fig. 5b demonstrates that high H2/CO2 ratios favor the CO2-to-alcohol transformation, since alcohol production is derived from the progressive hydrogenation of dissociated CO2. However, at a fixed flow rate, increasing the percentage of H2 means that the input of carbon source reduces, which would limit the C–C coupling process and ethanol production. Due to this reason, as the H2/CO2 ratio further increases from 3 to 4, it leads instead to a decrease in STYEtOH. Therefore, an optimal H2/CO2 ratio of 3:1 exists. The frequency of the dissipated power determined the discharge intensity, which in turn influenced the effect of the plasma phase reaction. In general, there exists an optimum operating frequency that creates the maximum output power at a fixed input voltage to facilitate the dissociation of the reactants in the plasma phase. As indicated in Fig. 5c, in regard to the DBD reactor used in this work, a discharge frequency of 9 kHz was determined to be the optimal operating mode for reaching the highest output power (Fig. S5†), as it achieved the highest ethanol selectivity (62.4%), STYEtOH (0.19 gEtOH h−1 gcat.−1) and CO2 conversion (40.5%). Another important parameter affecting the plasma discharge is the input voltage of the plasma supply. 20 volts is the threshold to generate a plasma discharge to effectively excite feed gas molecules, as shown in Fig. 5d. As the input voltage increases, the quantity of affected energetic electrons increases exponentially, leading to more efficient molecular excitation. It is worth noting that the breakdown voltage of the gas is constant. When the applied voltage of the plasma reactor satisfies the gas breakdown voltage, further increasing the voltage has little effect on the plasma discharge. Therefore, an input voltage of 30 volts was determined to be the optimum parameter.

The stability of the catalyst–NTP coupling system is also an essential property that is worth being investigated. It is generally believed that the stability of HKUST-1 and its derived catalysts is negatively affected by heat and moisture due to the fragile coordination assembly mode between copper ions and carboxylate ligands, leading to an irreversible structural collapse in conventional catalysis.36,37 In our work, however, Cu(I)-HKUST-17.5 was evidenced to be a robust and stable catalyst, which is mainly due to the non-thermodynamic equilibrium feature of our NTP catalytic system, as it is able to achieve effective CO2 dissociation at low temperatures. After 9 hours of continuous operation, Cu(I)-HKUST-17.5 still exhibited good selectivity for the target ethanol production, although the catalytic effect was marginally diminished (Fig. 6a). The XRD patterns and SEM images of the fresh and used catalysts Cu(I)-HKUST-17.5 are presented in Fig. 6. It is clear that the characteristic peaks of the catalysts before and after the reaction are almost identical, indicating no significant loss of crystallinity. Likewise, no appreciable structural destruction was observed in the SEM image comparison. The results demonstrate that the structural integrity of the catalyst was maintained during the plasma-assisted reaction. Interestingly, after use in CO2 hydrogenation, the percentage of Cu(I) sites in the catalyst rose by 15.8%, accompanied by a decline in Cu(II) species from 59.3% to 43.5% (Fig. 6d). The change of the copper valence state during the catalytic process could be inferred as the influence of the reduced hydrogen plasma, which effectively prevents the carbon deposition and oxidation behavior on the Cu(I) active sites. Furthermore, the NTP catalytic system demonstrates potential adaptability to renewable energy sources with unstable energy output (such as wind, tidal and solar energy), as its catalytic process has proven to be easily controllable by switching the power on/off.

As discussed previously, the Cu(I) and Cu(II) species on the designed Cu(I)-HKUST-17.5 have been postulated as potential active sites, but their specific roles in NTP-assisted CO2 hydrogenation still remain uncertain. We have, therefore, performed in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (in situ DRIFTS) using a custom-made IR detection cell to determine the possible reaction pathways where the Cu(I) and Cu(II) sites might be involved. As shown in Fig. 7a, without plasma, only chemisorbed CO2 centered at 3715 and 3615 cm−1 and gaseous CO2 at 2364 and 2337 cm−1 were detected, indicating that the catalyst was insensitive to CO2 hydrogenation without the assistance of NTP.38 As plasma was switched on, the number of chemisorbed CO2 species immediately decreased. This phenomenon was accompanied by the appearance of adsorbed Cu(II)–CO (2162 cm−1) and Cu(I)–CO peaks (2116 cm−1), demonstrating our NTP–catalyst coupled system's capacity for dissociating CO2 at room temperature.39 The peaks at 2939 and 2834 cm−1 were assigned to the ν(CH3) of the H3CO* species, which is a typical intermediate of the CO2 hydrogenation to ethanol.40 It is worth mentioning that the characteristic C–O peak of alcohols was observed at 1103 and 1015 cm−1.41,42 Both of the peak intensities increased with the extension of the reaction time, suggesting the accumulation of alcohol products. It is evident from Fig. 7b that the presence of bicarbonate (1660 and 1415 cm−1) and bidentate carbonate (1282 cm−1) indicates the strong adsorption of excited CO2 (COO− species) by Cu(I)-HKUST-17.5.41,43 In addition, the peaks at 1714, 1595, 1397 and 1358 cm−1 were identified as critical initial intermediates (HCOO−) in ethanol production, while the peak positioned at 1460 cm−1 was confirmed to be typical of the methoxy species.40,44 Considering the above-mentioned observation, the reaction pathway is postulated as follows: a plasma-activated CO2 molecule is hydrogenated to form HCOO− and then CH2O; these species eventually achieve C–C coupling via the formate pathway to develop ethanol.

4. Discussion
The results described above have confirmed the successful plasma-assisted hydrogenation of CO2 to ethanol by our designed Cu(I)-catalyst, which is presumed to result from synergistic interactions at two levels, including (i) the synergic effect between the plasma and the catalyst (macro-level) and (ii) the synergic effect between Cu(I) and Cu(II) sites on the catalyst (micro-level).
4.1 The interaction between non-thermal plasma and Cu(I)-HKUST-n
Cu(I) sites, in thermo-catalytic CO2 hydrogenation, rarely function as the main catalytic sites due to weak CO2 activation capacity.45 The unique pre-activation mode of plasma catalysis provides a feasible solution. Prior to being adsorbed on the catalyst, the reactant molecules (such as CO2 and H2) are excited or dissociated by collisions with high-energy electrons formed in the plasma electric field. As a result, the excited or dissociated species are adsorbed onto catalyst active sites and produce abundant reactive intermediates.46 Subsequently, these reactive species (such as  CO* and H*) are adsorbed on the copper sites, where reactions are selectively carried out to produce desirable alcohol products.24 As shown in Fig. 3, CO2 hydrogenation was successfully realized by relying solely on the plasma discharge (without catalyst), confirming the potential of NTP to efficiently dissociate CO2 and H2 at ambient temperature and pressure. When a catalyst (including HKUST-1 and our designed Cu(I)-HKUST-n) was introduced into the plasma discharge zone, the yield of liquid products and the CO2 conversion increased dramatically. Even the untreated HKUST-1 also achieved 23.9% methanol selectivity. This can be attributed to (i) the porous framework structure of the MOF-based catalyst's ability to adsorb the reactive species generated by plasma, which significantly enhances the functionalization of short-lived intermediates (the CO2 adsorption tests are presented in Fig. S7†); (ii) the packed catalyst particles support the formation of catalyst surface discharge as well as a stable and energy-concentrated plasma discharge mode (Fig. 4), which encourages reactants to be dissociated near the catalytic site so that the diffusion distance is shortened, and the local concentrations of the reactive intermediates are increased.47,48 Compared to the primary HKUST-1, Cu(I)-HKUST-1 exhibits selective production of C2+ alcohols due to the proper binding energy of Cu(I) for methoxy and formate species (Fig. 7), which facilitates the implementation of the C–C coupling reaction.15 In summary, the introduction of Cu(I)-HKUST-n significantly improves the utilization of feed gas and the selectivity of the C2 product in non-thermal plasma-catalyzed CO2 hydrogenation. Notably, the non-thermal equilibrium nature of the plasma phase reaction not only triggers efficient CO2 dissociation at low temperatures to facilitate CO2 hydrogenation over the catalyst, but also creates a mild reaction environment (35 °C, atmospheric pressure) that is unimaginable with conventional catalysis, thus avoiding the degradation of catalyst stability due to sintering and carbon deposition.49
4.2 The role of Cu(I) and Cu(II) sites in plasma-assisted conversion of CO2 to ethanol
As shown in Fig. 6, monovalent and divalent copper are confirmed as the main valence states of copper species on Cu(I)-HKUST-17.5. The Cu(I) sites are considered as the key driver for the C–C coupling and synthesis of ethanol due to their suitable activation and adsorption ability of CH2O and H2OCCO intermediates.15,50,51 The plasma-assisted CO2 hydrogenation experiments with CuO and Cu2O as catalysts also support this inference, with ethanol production observed only in the presence of Cu2O (Fig. S8†), while Cu(II) sites are considered as potential adsorption centers of active H species, which have a determinant effect on the progressive CO2 hydrogenation occurring at the adjacent Cu(I) sites. The synergy between Cu(I) and Cu(II) sites results in the selective CO2 hydrogenation to ethanol. As shown in Table 1, the primary HKUST-1 contains very few Cu(I) sites. The RVT-treatment effectively reduces Cu(II) to Cu(I) sites, leading to a dramatic increase in the ratio of Cu(I) to Cu(II). The increased ratios of Cu(I) sites, in turn, result in a sharp rise in the yield of ethanol and the ratio of ethanol to methanol in the product, confirming the critical role of Cu(I) sites in ethanol production. 17.5 hour RVT treatment deems to be optimal, where the catalyst, Cu(I)-HKUST-17.5, has a balanced ratio of Cu(I) and Cu(II) sites. Prolonging the RVT treatment time results in further reduction of Cu(II) to Cu(I). The catalysts Cu(I)-HKUST-22.5 and Cu(I)-HKUST-27.5 increased the RCu(I)/RCu(II) ratios to 0.72 and 0.95, respectively, but their yields of ethanol dropped to 20.7% and 16.4%, which was attributed to the hindered cooperation between the two copper sites. Specifically, the  or methoxide intermediates adsorbed on the Cu(I) site could not be further hydrogenated owing to the insufficient H* supply. Based on Fig. 1d and 2, we have concluded that the methanol vapor reduction effects are accumulative on HKUST-1, which is evidenced by the increased mesopores from 27 Å to 32 Å. Ligands of the framework are gradually dissociated to create defects, which provide space to accommodate more reduced methanol vapor, which triggers a more efficient reduction in the local regions. It results in imbalanced distribution of Cu(I) and Cu(II) sites within the reduced HKUST, especially for HKUST-22.5 and HKUST-27.5. The two catalysts with extended hours of reduction are dominated by Cu(I) rich clusters, but their performance in CO2-to-ethanol is not as good as that of HKUST-17.5, which has less Cu(I) rich clusters. The observation apparently indicates that the two copper sites may have synergetic effects in CO2 hydrogenation to ethanol.
In conclusion, plasma, Cu(I) and Cu(II) all play a role in ensuring satisfactory ethanol selectivity. Herein we propose a possible hypothesis for the mechanism of ethanol synthesis based on the above analysis and literature results (Fig. 8). First, the NTP is responsible for the activation of the reactants. H2 is excited to reactive hydrogen species (R1) due to the collision of high-energy electrons. Similarly, CO2 can also be efficiently activated to carboxylates COO−(R2) and even further dissociated to CO (R3), which has been observed in the in situ DRIFT spectra (Fig. 7a). H2(a) + e− → H(a) + H(a)(1) CO2(a) + e− → COO−(a)(2) COO−(a) → CO(a) + O−(a)(3)
 Fig. 8  The synthesis mechanism diagram of ethanol on the Cu(I)-HKUST-n catalyst with the assistance of plasma. 
Then, the activated carbon and hydrogen species are adsorbed by Cu(I) and Cu(II) sites. Based on the results shown in Fig. 7b, COO− is first formed to facilitate the production of the intermediate HCOO−(R4), which undergoes dehydration and then hydrogenation to produce the critical intermediate H2CO (R5). Another possible pathway is that the CO species is directly hydrogenated to H2CO (R6). But in any case, the formation of the H2CO intermediate is a necessary step for methanol production (R7). COO−(a) + H(a) → HCOO−(a)(4) HCOO−(a) + 3H(a) → H2CO(a) + H2O(g)(5) CO(a) + 2H(a) → H2CO(a)(6) H2CO(a) + 2H(a) → CH3OH(a)(7)
Alternatively, H2CO obtained in the previous process might also react with CO to synthesize ethanol via the C–C coupling process (R8)–(R10). The monovalent copper sites are considered to play a leading role in this process as we discussed. H2CO(a) + CO(g) → H2OCCO(a)(8) H2OCCO + 2H(a) → CH3CH2O(a) + H2O(g)(9) CH3CH2O(a) + H(a) → CH3CH2OH(g)(10)
5. Conclusions
A series of Cu(I)/MOF catalysts, Cu(I)-HKUST-n, were synthesized in this study and the methanol vapor treatment (RVT) method was applied to reduce Cu(II) to Cu(I) sites. The catalysts exhibited unreported high ethanol production potential in non-thermal plasma assisted CO2 hydrogenation. However, without the catalyst, the NTP system showed low CO2 conversion and low product selectivity. It demonstrated the crucial role of the designed Cu(I)-HKUST in the selective generation of ethanol. In further tests, the Cu(I) sites were determined to play a decisive role in the selective production of ethanol, while the Cu(II) sites were regarded as potential suppliers of active H* species. The best-performing catalyst was Cu(I)-HKUST-17.5, which achieved 41.2% CO2 conversion and 62.9% ethanol selectivity at 35 °C and atmospheric pressure. It is noteworthy that the combination of Cu(I) and Cu(II) sites is totally not expected for ethanol production in conventional catalysis, and the effective pre-dissociation of CO2 and H2via non-thermal plasma is considered to be the precondition for them to achieve surprising results. Based on in situ DRIFTS analysis, we propose this unreported synergistic catalytic mechanism between non-thermal plasma, Cu(I), and Cu(II) sites. The direct hydrogenation of CO2 to ethanol under ambient conditions has been a challenging issue in the resource utilization of CO2. We, therefore, hope that this work will provide insight into using non-thermal plasma coupled catalytic systems in ethanol production.
