    , Accepted 17th February 2014First published on 31st March 2014AbstractIn this work, we report a facile dip-coating approach to fabricate mechanically robust hybrid thin films with high transmittance and durable superhydrophilicity. Glass substrates were first coated with a mesostructured SiO2 thin film (MSiO2) by acid catalysis. The thin film is continuously mesoporous with antireflective and self-cleaning properties. Then, the substrate with MSiO2 thin film was covered with a mesoporous TiO2 thin film (MTiO2) by dip-coating. The maximum transmittance of the hybrid thin film coated substrate is as high as 96.9% at 620 nm. The film surface showed an outstanding superhydrophilic property (water contact angle less than 1° in 0.5 s). The superhydrophilicity of the as-prepared double layer thin film could last for 60 days, which is much better than those of the as-prepared SiO2 thin film (30 days) and the as-prepared TiO2 thin film (15 days). The MSiO2–MTiO2 thin film lost its superhydrophilicity after being stored in the dark for 105 days, but its superhydrophilicity could be restored by UV illumination. It could maintain its self-cleaning property after repeated storage and UV irradiation cycles, suggesting self-healing superhydrophilicity by UV irradiation. Taber abrasion test, sand impact test and washing test showed that the hybrid thin film had excellent mechanical robustness and could remain nearly intact during these tests. SEM, AFM, BET and XRD were employed to characterize the morphology, porosity and crystal form of the hybrid thin film. Methylene blue photodegradation was examined to evaluate the photocatalytic activity of the hybrid thin film. The MSiO2–MTiO2 coated glasses have potential in various areas, like solar cells, windowpanes and eyeglasses, and may also find applications in membrane-based separation, selective catalysis and sensors.
Introduction
Photovoltaic (PV) power has been receiving more and more attention due to increasing consumption of non-renewable resources and worsening environmental pollution. PV devices are installed outdoors, therefore, glass covers serving as a window to protect solar cells from impact and erosion are necessary.1,2 Transmittance of the glass cover is closely related to the efficiency of PV devices. However, reflection from clean PV glass surfaces at a normal angle of incidence is as high as 8%. If dust deposition, wind erosion, rain, snow and other harsh natural conditions are taken into consideration, the transmittance of the glass cover would be significantly lowered, which would eventually result in significant loss of photovoltaic power output.
Various materials have been explored to meet the above challenges,3–7 of which SiO2 and TiO2 are two important materials for light-involving applications. Porous SiO2 films are beneficial to enhance the light transmission for glass as a result of the low refractive index and low surface scattering. They also could exhibit excellent superhydrophilicity and self-cleaning property, since there is a large number of hydroxyl groups present on the surface. Besides, the light-induced superhydrophilicity and photocatalysis of TiO2 is well-known. When excited by UV illumination, TiO2 can decompose organic contaminants adhering to the surface. The superhydrophilic property of TiO2 stimulated by UV light facilitates the spread and flow of water droplets on the surface, which also aids the self-cleaning process.8,9 Taking into account the diversity of applications, the integration of antireflective (AR), self-cleaning (SC) and photocatalytic functionalities on one substrate is of great importance, especially for solar energy utilization. However, there are still significant challenges to meet before such integrated functionalities are realized and eventually brought to practical applications. First, a TiO2 coating on glass usually increases the reflectivity of the substrate due to its high refractive index (n = 2.5 for anatase phase10), rendering the light transmission of glass low for solar applications.11 Second, the photo-induced superhydrophilicity rapidly vanishes when the surface is stored in the absence of UV exposure.12 Similarly, the superhydrophilicity of a SiO2 coating will be lost after a period of time because of the accumulation of dust and organic contaminants. Third, on the one hand, large surface area, high porosity and roughness are required for films with excellent wettability and photocatalytic activity. While on the other hand, AR property prefers a nearly flat surface to reduce light scattering loss and high porosity to ensure efficient light capture. Finally, the durability of superhydrophilicity and mechanical robustness of AR/SC films, which are usually very poor, are often ignored in previous studies. However, they are key issues for practical applications. Therefore, the AR, SC and mechanical properties must be enhanced in terms of durability for practical uses. Meanwhile, the optimization of a surface in terms of these integrated properties is a significant and complicated challenge that demands a detailed investigation to achieve a balance between them.
In recent years, transparent self-cleaning thin films consisting of SiO2 and TiO2 have been attracting increasing interest due to their significant potential in a variety of practical applications. A few works have been reported concerning antireflective, superhydrophilic and photocatalytically active self-cleaning SiO2–TiO2 coatings on glass or other transparent substrates.2,13–18 For example, Miao et al. demonstrated a sol–gel dip-coating method for fabrication of SiO2–TiO2 bilayer coatings with antireflective and self-cleaning functions.15 An average transmittance gain of 3.4% was achieved over the spectral range of 400–800 nm for the optimized SiO2–TiO2 bilayers. The water contact angle changed from 89.5° to 23.5° by UV irradiation, and thus the SiO2–TiO2 bilayer coating did not reach superhydrophilicity. Fateh et al. studied the effect of addition of SiO2 to TiO2 towards a better transparent self-cleaning surface, and found that the addition of SiO2 could improve the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 film and the highest photocatalytic activity was reached at a TiO2–SiO2 molar ratio of 1:0.9.16 Unfortunately, the transmittance of the coated substrate was lowered as compared with the uncoated substrate, and its superhydrophilicity disappeared after storage in the dark for a few days. Our group prepared raspberry-like SiO2–TiO2 nanoparticles by a one-pot method.13 SiO2–TiO2 coatings were prepared via layer-by-layer (LbL) assembly with both photocatalytic self-cleaning and antireflective properties. The maximum transmittance of the prepared coating reached as high as 97.3%. However, the robustness of LbL-assembled thin films needs to be improved.
In the current work, we first fabricated an acid-catalyzed SiO2 thin film on glass substrate with excellent AR and SC properties by dip-coating. Unlike SiO2 coatings fabricated using SiO2 nanoparticles synthesized by the base-catalyzed Stöber method,19 the SiO2 film is homogeneously mesoporous with high mechanical robustness (MSiO2 thin film). Then we synthesized a TiO2 precursor solution. The formation of precursor solution can be understood on the basis of the work of Lianos et al.20 We made some improvements to increase its stability and make the preparation process simpler and more convenient. Then, we fabricated a mesoporous TiO2 (MTiO2) thin film on the MSiO2-coated substrate. The morphology and structure of thin films were characterized by SEM, AFM, BET and XRD. The physicochemical properties of the thin films were investigated by measuring their transmittance, water contact angles and photocatalytic activity. In particular, we carried out a detailed investigation into the superhydrophilicity changes of MSiO2, MTiO2 and MSiO2–MTiO2 coatings over time under both dark and UV irradiation conditions. The durability of superhydrophilicity of the MSiO2–MTiO2 hybrid film was shown to increase significantly. The current approach is highly advantageous for both research and practical scaled-up production, due to its facile, time-saving, and low-cost characteristics.
Materials and methods
Materials
Commercial glass slides (Sail brand, size: 7.5 cm × 2.5 cm × 0.1 cm), hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), hydrochloric acid (38%), absolute ethanol (99.5%), acetone, Triton X-100, cyclohexane, and methylene blue (MB, 98.5%) were purchased from Beihua Fine Chemicals. Tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS, 99+ %), titanium(IV) n-butoxide (TNBT, 98+ %) were obtained from Alfa Aesar. All chemicals were of analytic grade and used without further purification. Ultrapure water with a resistivity higher than 18.2 MΩ cm was used in all experiments, and was obtained from a three-stage Millipore Mill-Q Plus 185 purification system (Academic).
Methods

Preparation of acid-catalyzed silica sol. 
Acid-catalyzed SiO2 sol was synthesized as follows.21 22.3 mL TEOS, 22.3 mL ethanol, 1.8 mL H2O and 4 × 10−3 mL hydrochloric acid (38%) were added into a flask and stirred for 90 min at 60 °C. Then, 7.2 mL hydrochloric acid, 0.4 mL H2O and 46.6 mL ethanol were added, and the solution was stirred at room temperature (25 °C) for 15 min. After the solution was aged at 50 °C for 3 h, 106 mL ethanol and 5.3 g CTAB were added, followed by vigorous stirring for 1 h. Finally, a transparent sol with ca. 4 nm silica nanoparticles was obtained.


Preparation of reverse-micelle TiO2 precursor solution. 
First, 26.0 g Triton X-100 and 150 mL cyclohexane were mixed with vigorous stirring. After stirring for 30 min, 20–25 g TNBT was added dropwise. The resulting solution was then stirred at room temperature (25 °C) for 60 min. Finally, 10 mL acetylacetone was added to the solution, resulting in a stable TiO2 sol. The sol was diluted by cyclohexane until the volume fraction of TNBT dropped to 1.5–5%.

Thin film assembly
First, a glass slide was immersed in the acid-catalyzed SiO2 sol for 1–5 min (RH: 20–30%), and withdrawn at a speed of 8 cm min−1 from the sol. Second, the as-prepared glass slide with MSiO2 thin film was annealed at 500–700 °C for 1–5 min. Third, the MSiO2 coated glass slide was immersed in the TiO2 precursor solution for 1–5 min (RH: 20–50%), and withdrawn at an identical speed of 8 cm min−1. Finally, the glass slide coated with MSiO2–MTiO2 was calcined at 550 °C for 3 h.
Apart from the above-described thin film samples, powder samples were also prepared by the same procedure as the thin films. The detailed processes were as follows: firstly, the MSiO2 or MTiO2 sol, which had the same composition as the corresponding thin film, was dried at 100 °C in air in order to obtain a gel, then heat-treated in air at a ramp rate of 3 °C min−1 to 550 °C and kept at that temperature for 3 h, and was eventually ground by an agate pestle and mortar to obtain a powder.
Characterization
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observations were carried out on a Hitachi S-4800 field emission scanning electron microscope. The specimens were coated with a layer of gold by ion sputtering before SEM observations. For transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observations, the powder products were dispersed in ethanol by sonication for 10 min, and added onto carbon-coated copper grids. After drying at 60 °C overnight, they were observed on a JEOL JEM-2100F transmission electron microscope at an acceleration voltage of 150 kV. The roughness and morphology of the film surfaces were characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM) on an MM8-SYS scanning probe microscope (Bruker AXR). Transmission and reflection spectra in the wavelength range of 300–2500 nm were recorded using a Varian Cary 5000 UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer. Water contact angles (WCAs) of film surfaces were measured at ambient temperature on a JC2000C contact angle/interface system (Shanghai Zhongchen Digital Technique Apparatus Co.), the angle precision of which is ±0.5°. Water droplets of 3 μL were dropped carefully onto the film surfaces. Once a water droplet contacted the sample surface, the machine began to take photos at a speed of 30 photos per s, i.e., the interval between the contact moment and the first image was 33 ms. The measurement was carried out on three different areas of the sample surface. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the prepared products, recorded on a Bruker D8 Focus X-ray diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.154184 nm), were used to identify phase compositions in the products. Nitrogen adsorption–desorption measurements were performed on a Quantachrome NOVA 4200e surface area analyzer at −196 °C using the volumetric method. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) specific surface areas were calculated by using adsorption data in P/P0 = 0.04–0.20 (six points collected). The pore size distribution of SiO2 powder was obtained from the desorption branch of the isotherm by the Density Functional Theory (DFT) method. The pore size distribution of TiO2 powder was estimated from the adsorption branch of the isotherm by using the Barrett–Joyner–Halend (BJH) method. Pore volumes were determined from the amounts of N2 adsorbed at the single point of P/P0 = 0.98.
The photocatalytic self-cleaning property of prepared thin films was evaluated by investigating their ability to decompose MB under UV irradiation. A MB stock solution of 2 mg L−1 was prepared. UV irradiation was provided by a high pressure mercury lamp (250 W) through a thick transparent jacket with circulating-water to cool the lamp and remove the effect of heat. The glass slides with MSiO2 thin film and MSiO2–MTiO2 thin film were dipped in a MB solution of 2 mg L−1 for 30 s, and withdrawn at a speed of 12 cm min−1, followed by drying in air at ambient temperature. The specimens with MB were then exposed to UV irradiation. The decomposition of MB was monitored on the basis of the gradual disappearance of the MB peak in the transmission spectrum using a TU-1901 spectrophotometer.
Results and discussion
Structure and morphology of MSiO2–MTiO2 hybrid thin film
MSiO2 and MSiO2–MTiO2 thin films were subjected to SEM and AFM analyses to gain information about their surface morphology and roughness. Fig. 1a shows that the MSiO2 film is very flat and smooth, and has nano-scaled cracks (indicated by an arrow in Fig. 1a), the width of which was estimated to be ca. 5 nm. The MSiO2 thin film was scraped from the glass substrate to explore its internal structure. The TEM image (inset in Fig. 1a) reveals the existence of closely packed worm-like nanopores within the thin film. The average center-to-center distance between two adjacent nanochannels is ca. 3.94 nm, and the pore size was thus roughly estimated to be ca. 1.85 nm. After coating with the MTiO2 thin film, the smooth and compact MSiO2 thin film is covered with nearly monodisperse TiO2 nanoparticles. Because of the random packing and aggregation of TiO2 nanoparticles, the MSiO2–MTiO2 thin film appears as a porous structure (Fig. 1b and c).

The mean diameter of TiO2 nanoparticles, which were distributed uniformly on the film surface, was estimated to be ca. 12.8 nm. The AFM images of MSiO2–MTiO2 hybrid thin film are presented in Fig. 1d and e. The line profile is also provided with the figures in the indicated AB direction. The root-mean-square (RMS) roughness was estimated as ∼1.38 nm from a scanning area of 2 μm × 2 μm. This outcome verifies the SEM observations that the coverage of TiO2 nanoparticles is complete and uniform. We also carried out an XRD measurement of the TiO2 powder sample prepared through the same procedure as the thin films. The XRD pattern (Fig. S1†) shows that, after calcination, the TiO2 sol transformed into anatase phase (tetragonal) with high crystallinity (JCPDS 21-1272). The crystallite size of MTiO2 powder was estimated using Scherrer's formula from the major diffraction peak (101), and is ca. 11.53 nm, which agrees well with the SEM observations.
The surface area of MSiO2–MTiO2 thin film on glass substrate could not be measured directly by nitrogen adsorption–desorption experiments, because the amount of the thin film on glass substrate was too small. Thus, we measured the surface area and pore size of the corresponding powder samples prepared through the same procedure as the thin films. The results are shown in Fig. 2. The BET specific surface area of SiO2 powder was estimated to be 1023.1 m2 g−1. In the relative pressure range of >0.2, the isotherm shows almost unchanged sorption characteristics. Furthermore, there is almost no hysteresis loop in the isotherm. These findings clearly indicate the presence of microporosity and mesoporosity in the SiO2 powder. The pore size distribution is centered at ca. 1.51 nm and ca. 2.52 nm, respectively, for micropores and mesopores. The BET surface area of TiO2 powder was estimated to be 81.7 m2 g−1 and the pore size distribution is centered at ca. 6.8 nm. In general, uniformly agglomerated particles usually render a narrow pore size distribution, which typically falls in the range of 1/2–1/5 of the primary particle size.22 Clearly, the nitrogen adsorption–desorption measurements are consistent with the above SEM and XRD observations. Micropores and mesopores in the thin films are beneficial to suppressing light reflection and enhancing light transmission.23,24

From the above discussion, a plausible mechanism was proposed for the formation of MSiO2–MTiO2 hybrid thin film, and is schematically illustrated in Fig. 3. The formation of MSiO2–MTiO2 hybrid thin film proceeds via self-assembly of TEOS/CTAB and TNBT/Triton X-100, respectively. Such a process is a typical evaporation induced self-assembly (EISA), which presents several advantages such as versatility of processability, efficient integration of well-defined nanostructures on various substrates and rapid deposition.25 When the precursor sol is deposited on the substrate, evaporation of volatile components (e.g., EtOH, H2O and HCl) takes place at the air/film interface, leading to progressive and rapid enrichment of the film in the form of SiO2 oligomers and template molecules. When the surfactant concentration in the system reaches the critical micelle concentration, micelles start to form by aggregation of hydrophobic alkyl chains. The elongated micelles are randomly distributed, which is supported by the TEM images of SiO2 thin film. Ultimately, the stable mesoporous network forms by further condensation and elimination of the template. The disordered worm-like pore structure is generally encountered for a high degree of silica condensation or a low CTAB/TEOS molar ratio, which was also adopted in the current fabrication (H2O/TEOS molar ratio: 1, CTAB/TEOS molar ratio: 0.14).25,26

Unlike hydrophilic ethanol in the SiO2 sol, however, the solvent in the TiO2 sol, i.e., cyclohexane, is hydrophobic. Thus, TiO2 spherical nanoparticles are surrounded by surfactant molecules with their polar heads in contact with the polar TiO2 surface after hydrolysis and their hydrophobic groups extending outwards.20 And the mesoporous TiO2 thin film eventually forms by aggregation of TiO2 nanoparticles. For both the Si- and Ti-based systems, a fine control over the specific chemical and processing parameters is the key to reproducibility.
Optical performance of MSiO2–MTiO2 hybrid thin film

Fig. 4 shows the UV-Vis-NIR transmission spectra of blank, MSiO2, MTiO2 and MSiO2–MTiO2 coated glass substrates. After coating the MSiO2 thin film, transmittance improved significantly as compared with blank substrate and the maximum transmittance reached 97.1% at 662 nm. A TiO2 coating normally leads to a decrease in the transmittance of the substrate because of the high refractive index of TiO2. However, the MSiO2–MTiO2 hybrid thin film still remarkably improved the transmittance as compared with blank glass substrate. The maximum transmittance reached as high as 96.9% at 620 nm. At 380–440 nm, there is a significant decrease in the transmittance of MSiO2–MTiO2 hybrid thin film, which is apparently due to absorption of light caused by the excitation of electrons from the valence band to the conduction band of TiO2. The MSiO2–MTiO2 thin film contains small TiO2 crystallites of large bandgap and strong oxidation power.27 This is a premise for the MTiO2 thin film with photo-induced superhydrophilic and photocatalytic properties. In the wavelength range of 450–1100 nm, which is the main wavelength range of silicon solar cells for light absorption and photoelectric conversion, the average transmittance of MSiO2–MTiO2 hybrid thin film increases significantly by 4.8%, as compared with that of the blank substrate. However, in the wavelength range of 1100–2500 nm, which is the undesirable range for silicon solar cells, the average transmittance increases only by 1.1%.

Superhydrophilicity and its durability of MSiO2–MTiO2 hybrid thin film
Since a large number of hydroxyl groups are present on the surface, SiO2 coatings generally exhibit a hydrophilic property. TiO2 coatings are also widely reported as having photo-induced hydrophilicity.28–30 Thus both SiO2 coating and TiO2 coating could be used in the applications of antifogging and self-cleaning. However, they both have defects to some extent for applications that require both antireflective and self-cleaning properties. On the one hand, the superhydrophilicity of SiO2 coatings cannot be maintained for a long time due to the unavoidable deposition of dust and low surface tension contaminants. This drawback may be circumvented by applying an additional TiO2 component. On the other hand, the use of TiO2 coatings is generally limited for applications where high transmittance matters, because of their high refractive index. The high refractive index usually causes enhanced reflectance and lowered transmittance (Fig. 4, curve 3). Here, we studied the superhydrophilicity changes of as-prepared MSiO2, MTiO2 and MSiO2–MTiO2 thin films over time in the dark and under UV irradiation.
All the freshly prepared MSiO2, MTiO2 and MSiO2–MTiO2 thin films showed highly superhydrophilic properties. Their water contact angles at a spreading time of 0.5 s were 3.2, 3.8 and 2.5, respectively. From the viewpoint of most practical applications, the superhydrophilicity of surfaces must remain stable for a long time, which is unfortunately very difficult to achieve. Usually, the superhydrophilic property gradually weakens after storing for a few days or months under ambient conditions. However, this phenomenon is often overlooked. Fujishima's group once reported that the superhydrophilic nature of their TiO2-coated PET films could be retained for at least 18 days in the dark after UV irradiation.31 However, the performance is important but unknown over a much extended period of time. Here, we studied in detail how the superhydrophilic property of the current thin films changes over time. Fig. 5 shows time-dependent variations of 0.5 s spreading and static water contact angle of the MSiO2, MTiO2 and MSiO2–MTiO2 thin films. The superhydrophilic property (below 5° within 0.5 s) of MTiO2 thin film could last for 15 days. After two months, the WCA at a spreading time of 0.5 s increased to 26.4°, already losing superhydrophilicity. The MSiO2 thin film performed slightly better, the superhydrophilic property lasting over one month. After two months, the WCA at a spreading time of 0.5 s increased to 10.1°. In sharp contrast, the MSiO2–MTiO2 thin film showed much better stability of superhydrophilicity. The superhydrophilic property could be sustained for two months, and the static WCA of MSiO2–MTiO2 thin film was still nearly 5° after storing in the dark for three months. Besides, the superhydrophilic MSiO2–MTiO2 thin film could maintain its outstanding antifogging performance even after immersion in water (25 °C) for two weeks, as shown in Fig. S2.†

Meanwhile, the thin film after storing in the dark for 105 days could restore its superhydrophilic property by UV illumination. As shown in Fig. 6a, the surface of MSiO2–MTiO2 coated glass substrate restored its original excellent superhydrophilicity with a WAC of 1.9° upon UV illumination for 3 h (16.8 mW cm−2). The MSiO2–MTiO2 coated glass substrate could retain its superhydrophilicity after several cycles of storage in the dark and UV illumination, suggesting enduring and self-healing superhydrophilicity of the thin film upon intermittent exposure to UV irradiation.

(b) Schematic illustration of photoinduced superhydrophilicity on the MTiO2 thin film surface. 
The mechanisms of superhydrophilicity of SiO2 coatings and photoinduced superhydrophilicity of TiO2 coatings have been intensively investigated by many researchers.32–37 Furthermore, SiO2–TiO2 hybrid composites are well-known to have a strong photocatalytic effect.16,38 As proposed in the previous papers, the strong photocatalytic effect is attributed to TiOx− and/or SiOx+ species formed at granular interfaces, which results from the interfacial substitution of Si (Ti) atoms by Ti (Si) atoms less (more) electronegative and more (less) polarizable within a SiO2 (TiO2) network.39–41 These localized electric charges may favor dissociative adsorption of atmospheric water at the surface of the nanocomposite films, which would enhance water wettability of the surface. Since MSiO2 and MTiO2 were successively coated on the glass substrate rather than fully mixed in a precursor sol before coating, granular interface effects may not be the most important factor for wettability. Other physicochemical and structural properties such as surface roughness, porosity, surface hydroxyl content and surface energy, are considered to have important effects on the surface wettability. As described by the theoretical models of Wenzel32 or Bico et al.,42 morphological properties such as surface roughness and open porosity can modify the water wettability on the surface of rough hydrophilic films and enhance water impregnation within the thickness of porous films. Apparently, the combination of MSiO2 and MTiO2 thin films is conducive to increased surface roughness (Rq = 1.38 nm) and eventually leads to increased hydrophilicity. The porous structures are believed to be a major factor contributing to the excellent superhydrophilicity of films, which would attract water droplets into pores by capillary force, leading to low contact angles. The abundant micropores/mesopores and special composition of the hybrid film may play an important role in achieving the improved stability of superhydrophilicity. Besides, it is well-known that the hydrophilicity of a TiO2 surface is enhanced due to an increase in the amount of surface OH groups during UV irradiation (Fig. 6b). Excess holes are created and diffuse to the TiO2 surface after bandgap excitation. Subsequently, the excess holes are trapped at lattice oxygen sites, which leads to the weakening of the bond between the titanium atom and the lattice oxygen. The bond can be broken to react with water molecules, forming new hydroxyl groups.43 The higher the specific surface area, the greater the hydroxyl content that forms on the surface. The superhydrophilicity stability of MSiO2–MTiO2 thin film was greatly improved. The stability of superhydrophilicity (60 days) of MSiO2–MTiO2 thin film is better than that of the superimposed MTiO2 thin film (15 days) and MSiO2 thin film (30 days), which may be attributed to the synergistic effect between the MSiO2 and MTiO2 thin films. As far as we know, 60 days is quite a long time for maintaining the superhydrophilicity of SiO2 or TiO2 coatings in the literature reports. In addition, once superhydrophilicity starts to deteriorate due to progressive carbon contamination, the photo-activity of MTiO2 allows easy catalytic removal of contamination (as discussed in the following section) and photo-regeneration of superhydrophilicity through UV light irradiation. The excellent and durable superhydrophilic property, which allows water to uniformly spread and flow on the films, favors the SC process in long-term outdoor uses.44,45
Photocatalytic performance of MSiO2–MTiO2 hybrid thin film
Anatase TiO2 is a semiconductor with a large bandgap (Eg = 3.2 eV). Upon excitation by light of appropriate wavelength (λ < 385 nm), the absorbed photons can generate electron–hole pairs. On the one hand, the holes can react with H2O or hydroxide ions adsorbed at the particle surface to produce hydroxyl radicals (OH˙). On the other hand, the electrons can reduce O2 to produce superoxide radicals (O2˙−) and other reactive oxygen species (i.e., H2O2 and OH˙). They are extremely reactive towards organic compounds.46 These characteristics in combination with the photoinduced superhydrophilicity render the TiO2 surfaces with a self-cleaning property, which is conceivable to be very useful for outdoor applications under sunlight, such as photovoltaic devices.47 However, many challenges are yet to be addressed for ultimately realizing these applications.
The photocatalytic activity of MSiO2–MTiO2 hybrid thin film was assessed by its degradation of methylene blue (MB). The hybrid thin film showed a significant decrease in transmittance because of adsorbing MB, and a trough at the wavelength of 665 nm was observed in its transmission spectrum, which is attributed to the absorption of MB (Fig. 7a). The MSiO2–MTiO2 hybrid thin film with adsorbed MB showed a significant increase in transmittance as a function of illumination time. Simultaneously, the trough gradually vanished together with a blue shift in the position of the trough to shorter wavelength. The changes in spectral features are considered as the results of MB structural changes: the recovery in transmittance and the decrease in absorbance are due to degradation of the MB chromophore and the shift in the trough is due to de-methylation. The molecular formula of MB and Fig. 7a suggest that MB was N-demethylated in a stepwise manner (as confirmed by the gradual blue shift of trough wavelength), with degradation of the MB chromophore ring structure occurring concomitantly. The neutral intermediates have been identified by Zhu's group using LC/MS48 and N-demethylation, deamination and oxidative degradation take place during the photocatalyzed degradation of MB.

In Fig. 7b, the MB adsorbed on the MSiO2–MTiO2 hybrid thin film was completely degraded in 4 h under UV illumination (16.8 mW cm−2). In contrast, only half of the MB adsorbed on the MSiO2 coating was degraded in 4 h under otherwise identical conditions. Thus, the MSiO2–MTiO2 hybrid thin film showed excellent photocatalytic properties. As an important photocatalyst, TiO2 has strong oxidative power, with which it can completely decompose most organic substances under UV illumination.49,50 In general, the photodegradation rate of chemical compounds on semiconductor surfaces follows the classical Langmuir–Hinshelwood (LH) kinetic expression:46,49,51r = kθ = kKc/(1 + Kc), where the rate is proportional to the coverage θ or the adsorption constant K. Hence, the small size and uniform distribution of TiO2 nanoparticles are conducive to obtaining a high coverage θ or a large adsorption constant K, which would result in a high photocatalytic activity. Meanwhile, the high porosity in the MSiO2–MTiO2 hybrid thin film is also beneficial to rapid diffusion of reactants and products during UV illumination, which would enhance the speed of the photocatalytic reaction. When the rate of photocatalytic mineralization is higher than the contamination rate, the MSiO2–MTiO2 hybrid thin film could maintain a surface free from organic contamination under UV illumination.
Mechanical properties of MSiO2–MTiO2 hybrid thin film
Mechanical properties of thin films are a key issue, and must be considered for any possible practical applications. To assess the mechanical properties of the hybrid thin film, several complementary tests were carried out. Taber abrasion tests were carried out to assess the abrasion properties of the hybrid thin films. A normal load of 0.5 kg on the abrasive wheels with a rotational speed of 50 rpm was used to test the mechanical properties of the MSiO2–MTiO2 hybrid thin film, which is similar to an ASTM method, ASTM D 4060-01, to test the durability of optical and SC coatings. The hybrid thin film was tested for up to 100 cycles. Surprisingly, the thin film only showed several scratches, and even in the areas of scratches (Fig. 8a and b), the hybrid thin film was not stripped, indicating it could withstand the Taber abrasion test.

To quantify the outdoor mechanical stability of the surface, two other tests (sand impact and sponge washing) were also carried out to simulate severe natural conditions. Sand grains fell from a height of 1 m. The flow rate was 4 mL s−1, and the whole test lasted for 50 s. The stability of the MSiO2–MTiO2 hybrid thin film against the sand impact could be quantified by calculating the impact energy of a sand grain: Ws = msgh = 4/3πρRs3gh, where ρ is the density of silica (ρ ≈ 2 g cm−3), g the acceleration of gravity, and Rs the radius of sand grains (Rs ≈ 350 μm). It was calculated to be 3.57 × 10−7 J. Because there was plenty of remaining sand on the MSiO2–MTiO2 hybrid thin film, it was difficult to determine whether the surface had been scratched by means of SEM. Thus, we used energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) to investigate the existence of Ti after the sand impact test. As shown in Table S1,† even in the impact area there still remained 0.9 wt% Ti on the surface. The decrease in the Ti content was considered to be mainly attributed to the accumulation of sand grains on the tested surface from SEM observations. For outdoor applications such as solar panels and architectural windows, it is crucial to withstand the scrubbing of some substances, such as cotton and sponge, etc. Therefore, we used a sponge brush (ASTM D4828-92) to investigate the washing stability of MSiO2–MTiO2 hybrid thin film. The thin film was washed for up to 100 cycles in 2 min. After washing, some regions (less than 15%) showed scratches, as revealed in Fig. 8c and d. However, most of the thin film was still attached firmly to the surface, indicating that the thin film could endure practical washing.
Conclusions
In summary, MSiO2–MTiO2 hybrid thin films were successfully deposited on a glass substrate by dip-coating. Their morphology, optical performance, mechanical property, superhydrophilicity and its durability were investigated in detail. The results obtained are summarized as follows: (1) the dual functions of AR and SC were created in double-layered MSiO2–MTiO2 nanostructured thin films. The maximum transmittance of MSiO2–MTiO2 coated glass substrate is as high as 96.9% at 620 nm. At 450–1100 nm, which is the main wavelength range of silicon solar cells for light absorption and photoelectric conversion, the average transmittance increases by 4.8%. SEM, AFM and nitrogen adsorption–desorption measurements showed that there are abundant mesopores present in both MSiO2 thin film and MTiO2 thin film. (2) All the as-prepared MSiO2, MTiO2 and MSiO2–MTiO2 thin films showed outstanding superhydrophilic properties. The superhydrophilicity of the MSiO2–MTiO2 hybrid thin film could last for 60 days, which is much better than that of the MSiO2 thin film (30 days) and the MTiO2 thin film (15 days). The WCA of the MSiO2–MTiO2 thin film after storing in the dark for 105 days was only 7.2°. After that, the thin film could restore its original excellent superhydrophilicity with a WCA of 1.9° upon UV illumination, suggesting its enduring and self-healing superhydrophilicity upon intermittent exposure to UV irradiation. The open porosity, surface roughness, synergistic effect between MSiO2 and MTiO2, and photocatalytic removal of contamination and photo-regeneration of superhydrophilicity help induce the durable superhydrophilicity. (3) Taber abrasion test, sand impact test and sponge washing test were carried out to quantify the mechanical stability of the surface. The hybrid thin film with high hardness was stable towards all these tests, and showed an excellent mechanical property. The current approach is simple, fast, and effective, and may provide a new route to fabrication of antireflective, superhydrophilic and antifogging thin films on glass substrates with excellent superhydrophilic durability and mechanical property. Such excellent characteristics are highly desired especially for the sunlight harvesting and photovoltaic conversion fields.
