1. Introduction
Metal halide perovskites (MHPs) have become a promising class of materials nowadays. Owing to their outstanding material properties, such as high light absorption,1,2 long carrier diffusion length,3 high defect tolerance,4 tunable bandgap,5 and solution processability,6 this class of materials can be widely applied to optoelectronic devices.7 Among them, photovoltaic devices are important applications of perovskite materials. Two main research directions of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are all-inorganic perovskite solar cells and organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells. As the name suggests, all-inorganic PSCs use all-inorganic perovskite materials (usually cesium-based inorganic perovskites, such as CsPbI3−xBrx, CsPbI3, CsPbBr3 and etc.) as the optical absorption layers.8Fig. 1a shows the cubic crystal structure of all-inorganic perovskites, which have a generic structure ABX3, where A is usually Cs ions, B is usually Pb ions and X is usually halide ions (I, Br, Cl).

Today, the highest certification efficiency of organic–inorganic hybrid PSCs has been over 25% and that of all-inorganic ones has just exceeded 18%.9,10 The efficiencies of organic–inorganic hybrid PSCs have experienced explosive growth in the past few years, and the maximum efficiency has exceeded 70% of the theoretical limit efficiency while that of all-inorganic PSCs is less than 60% of the theoretical limit efficiency, which have large development potential.11 Though the device efficiencies of all-inorganic PSCs are a little lower, the highest certification efficiency of all-inorganic PSCs has increased rapidly in the past two years (from 12% to over 18%),12–15 and their performances have improved frequently.
Organic–inorganic hybrid PSCs tend to have poor thermal stability due to the poor thermal stability of organic components in perovskite active layers.16,17 This restrains the operational lifetime of PSCs under ambient conditions. Differently, the thermal stability of all-inorganic PSCs is much better, and which can work stably above 85 °C for a long time.18 Moreover, all-inorganic PSCs are less sensitive to light so that they can operate with more stability under continuous 1 sun equivalent illumination.19 The larger band gaps of all-inorganic perovskite materials are beneficial to achieve higher open-circuit voltages (VOC) for PSCs. Therefore, it is favorable to prepare PSCs with all-inorganic perovskite materials to obtain higher stability. However, all-inorganic perovskite materials show high sensitivity to humidity, which causes the low lifetime and poor stability of all-inorganic PSCs in air environments. In particular, CsPbI3 PSCs have the problem of phase stability. To achieve high performance, CsPbI3 is usually required to form an efficient black perovskite phase (α-CsPbI3) rather than a useless yellow non-perovskite phase (δ-CsPbI3). In low temperature and high humidity environments, it is difficult to maintain the black phase α-CsPbI3 in untreated CsPbI3 perovskite materials, so almost all CsPbI3 PSCs must be undergo special treatment to improve the durability of the black phase under operational conditions.20–22 In addition, it should take a high temperature of more than 300 °C to transform the yellow phase into the black phase.23 Until now, a lot of studies have been carried to reduce the annealing temperature for black phase CsPbI3.24,25
As we know, PSCs are sandwiched structures, with perovskite active layers sandwiched between two electrodes (Fig. 1b).26 Charge transport layers (CTLs) usually exist between perovskite active layers and electrodes to improve the device performance of PSCs. When a beam of light hits PSCs, perovskite active layers in PSCs will generate electron–hole pairs first. Then charge transport layers (CTLs) will extract carriers from perovskite active layers and transport them respectively to the two side electrodes. Interfaces exist between layers and influence the charge extraction and transport characteristics,27–29 which dominate the photovoltaic performance of PSCs. Therefore, the interfaces between perovskite layers and electrodes play a critical role in PSCs. Interface engineering is a general strategy to improve the performance of PSCs. Through choosing suitable charge transport materials (CTMs) or adjusting conventional CTMs,20–32 optimized device architectures and interface characteristics can be obtained, which is beneficial to charge carrier collection in PSCs and thus can improve the photovoltaic performance. Furthermore, another strategy to improve the charge extraction and transport is incorporating a thin-layer or mono-layer between perovskite layers and CTLs.33–35
The rapid advancements of PSCs are due to the application of interface engineering largely. The impact of interface engineering on PSCs is multifaceted. To ensure efficient charge extraction and transport, we usually select CTMs with high mobility and good energy-level alignment for devices.36,37 If the energy levels between perovskite active layers and CTLs are mismatched, there will be large energy losses at the interfaces, which will limit the open-circuit voltage (VOC) and fill factor (FF) of PSCs.38 Sometimes, conventional CTMs are not suitable for further promotion of the efficiency of PSCs, and the dopants can be utilized to improve the interfacial charge dynamics.39
Furthermore, an extra interfacial layer is often introduced to reconfigure the band architecture and achieve better energy alignment in PSCs.40,41 A good energy alignment is the reliable guarantee for efficient charge extraction and reduced recombination loss.42 On the other hand, this extra interfacial layer sometimes can influence the formation of high-quality perovskite films, and ensure effective defect passivation, so as to inhibit interfacial recombination and enhance phase stability.43–45 It is well known that perovskites are typical ionic crystals. There exists severe ion migration phenomenon when applying bias voltages to the PSCs in the measurement. Ion migration plays a significant role in generating current density–voltage (J–V) hysteresis and severe ion migration usually causes a high level of hysteresis, which will accelerate the degradation of PSCs.46 Incorporating an interfacial layer which has strong interaction with halide ions can effectively suppress the ion migration and enhance stability. Furthermore, some extra interfacial layers, such as thin hydrophobic modifiers or other protecting layers, can enhance the device stability and lifetime of PSCs under ambient environment significantly.47
In this review, we will retrospect interface engineering adopted for efficient, stable and hysteresis-less all-inorganic PSCs. We will mainly focus on two aspects: charge transport materials and interfacial properties to summarize the recent progress of all-inorganic PSCs based on interface engineering (Fig. 2). The main roles of interface engineering in all-inorganic PSCs such as adjusting energy-level alignment, enhancing charge transport capacity, passivating interface defects, modulating the morphology of perovskite films, stabilizing the perovskite phase, broadening spectral absorption, eliminating hysteresis and enhancing operational stability will be discussed. We hope that this review would help pave the way for all-inorganic PSCs with high efficiency and stability.

2. Charge transport materials
Except for a good perovskite active layer, charge transport layers, including electron transport layers (ETLs) and hole transport layers (HTLs), are one of the most important parts in all-inorganic PSCs. To choose suitable CTLs, it is necessary to consider the energy-level match and charge transport ability. At the same time, the temperature toleration properties of CTLs should also be considered in all-inorganic PSCs, because of the high temperature required for the mineralization of all-inorganic perovskite light-harvesting layers. Therefore, the CTLs beneath perovskite layers in PSCs must be able to withstand high temperature.
In all-inorganic PSCs, most of the ETLs are metal oxides and most of the HTLs are organic materials. These materials have good charge carrier extraction and transport capabilities, but they do not match the energy levels of all-inorganic perovskite materials well. In order to fix this problem, researchers have chosen to dope CTLs. Here, the latest dopants for CTMs are introduced in this review. The reported studies on all-inorganic PSCs, which introduce various dopants to CTMs, are summarized in Table 1.

2.1. The dopants in electron transport materials
In order to make it easier for electrons to be extracted to the ETLs, the energy level of ETLs needs to be slightly lower than that of the perovskite layers. Simultaneously, the ETLs usually are composed of materials which can form a dense barrier film to prevent the leakage caused by the contact between ITO/FTO electrodes and perovskite layers. In addition, most of the PSCs are forward structures. For this structure, light will be absorbed by the perovskite layers after passing through the ETLs. Therefore, the light transmittance of ETLs should be considered too.
The commonly used electron transport materials (ETMs) in PSCs are ZnO,18,48–51 SnO2,52–56 TiO2,57–60 PCBM and so on. To improve the properties of ETMs, introducing dopants to ETMs is one of the best methods. The dopants play significant roles in ETMs, such as enhancing electron transport capacity, modulating energy band structure, improving the film quality of both ETLs and perovskite films, etc.

2.1.1. Alkali metal and ion dopants. 
As one of the most widely used doping materials, alkali metal and ion dopants are favored for their controllability and simplicity.61–64 In recent years, some researchers have succeeded in using them in all-inorganic PSCs to adjust the energy level alignment. Liu's team, on the basis of using TiO2 nanorod array as ETLs to facilitate perovskite mineralization, doping ETLs with cesium (Cs) significantly improved the efficiency (9.5%) of CsPbI3 PSCs compared with devices without doping (5.8%).65 TiO2 nanorod array can solve the problem of the mesoporous scaffold structure hindering electron transmission, which makes the electron transmission path more rapidly and directly. The Cs dopant could increase the conduction band energy level of ETLs while increasing the carrier density, and fill the voids in perovskite films. The film formation quality of perovskites was also improved a lot.
In addition, ZnO is also a favorable electron transport material with good electrical properties, relatively low processing temperature and energy-level alignment in all-inorganic PSCs. Compared with other ETMs, the most important advantage of ZnO is that it has better light transmittance, which is very important for conventional forward structured PSCs. Shen and his team adopted cesium carbonate (Cs2CO3) to dope ZnO, which shifted the conduction band of ZnO to CsPbI2Br by 0.1 eV (Fig. 3a) and improved the electronic transmission capacity.18 This significantly improved the VOC and fill factor of PSCs. In addition, the low treatment temperature of ZnO enabled the fabrication of flexible PSCs on PET substrates, as shown in Fig. 3b. Recently, Yue et al.66 utilized Nb-doped ZnO combined with an ultra-thin TiO2 buffer layer as the ETL in CsPbI3 PSCs and achieved high performance PSCs with a large VOC of 1.31 V and a high efficiency up to 21.06%. The high concentration of the dopants significantly increased the charge density, which improved the electrical conductivity while curbing the carrier complexation near the interface. Through further incorporation of an ultra-thin buffer layer, the electron extraction efficiency showed a significant improvement and the device performance increased to a high level with a PCE of 21.06%.66

2.1.2. Organic and nonmetallic ion dopants. 
In addition to the most widely used alkali metal and ion dopants, there are still other kinds of dopants. Recently, C. Liu et al. tailored C60via a codoping strategy to construct an efficient electron transport layer.67 Firstly, tri(pentafluorophenyl)borane (TPFPB) was used as the dopant, through the formation of a Lewis acid adduct to reduce the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level of the ZnO@C60 layer, increasing the free energy difference, and thus reducing charge recombination. Secondly, a non-hygroscopic lithium salt (LiClO4) was added to increase the electron mobility and conductivity of the C60 film. Finally, the as-optimized CsPbI2Br PSCs gained a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 15.19%, with a stabilized power output (SPO) of 14.21% (0.09 cm2). They also designed and synthesized a new kind of non-fullerene organic compound SFX-PDI2, connecting the spirofluorene-9,9′-xanthene (SFX) core building block with two PDI units. SFX-PDI2 as the dopant in 6,6-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) could not only improve the electron transmission ability and extraction ability, but also help to form a uniform ETL with better coverage of the perovskite films, which effectively reduced the leakage phenomenon caused by charge coincidence.68
Non-metallic ions are often used as dopants in ETLs as well. NH4Cl has been found to be a good dopant to improve the electron mobility of ZnO, achieve good energy-level alignment at the ZnO/CsPbI2Br interface, and suppress the trap state density on the surface of perovskite films. A CsPbI2Br film with a micron level, high crystallinity, and high coverage was obtained at a low annealing temperature of 160 °C, and in this case, all-inorganic PSCs with a high VOC of 1.27 V were achieved.69 These methods discussed above have been widely used in organic–inorganic hybrid PSCs. However, further research is still needed in the field of all-inorganic PSCs.

2.2. The dopants in hole transport materials
The materials with suitable energy level and high hole mobility could be considered as HTLs. In addition, HTLs are fabricated after the perovskite layers in forward PSCs, so it need not undergo the high temperature treatment of perovskite layers. Organic materials with poor thermal stability,70,71 such as spiro-OMeTAD,72–74 PTAA,75–77 P3HT,78–80 and so on, are widely used as HTLs in all-inorganic PSCs. Moreover, inorganic hole transport materials (HTMs) are also utilized, which mainly include NiOx,81 CuOx,82 CuI,83 and so on.

2.2.1. The dopants in organic hole transport materials. 
Introducing Li-TFSI and t-BP as dopants in spiro-OMeTAD is a common strategy to increase its conductivity. The doped spiro-OMeTAD has been the most commonly used HTL with the best comprehensive effect so far, while the efficiency of PSCs without doping spiro-OMeTAD is very low. This proves that doping is a very effective way to improve the performance of PSCs.72–74 However, the hygroscopicity of the Li-TISF dopant will reduce the stability of perovskite films in moisture-sensitive all-inorganic PSCs.84 Except for the doping of spiro-OMeTAD, researchers also investigated the doping of PTAA. J. Endres and his team found that the band bending of PTAA formed a 0.2–0.5 eV barrier between PTAA and CsPbBr3. A p-type doping could solve this problem, making the highest occupied molecular orbital of PTAA 0.2 eV higher than the maximum value of the CsPbBr3 valence band (Fig. 3c and d) and improving the hole transport ability of PTAA.85 Regrettably, they did not fabricate the complete CsPbBr3 PSCs.


2.2.2. The dopants in inorganic hole transport materials. 
One of the advantages of all-inorganic PSCs is outstanding light stability and thermal stability. However, the existence of organic HTLs will reduce the advantages of all-inorganic PSCs, so inorganic HTLs are applied in all-inorganic PSCs due to their excellent inherent stability. Metal ions are incorporated into inorganic HTLs as dopants to improve the performance of PSCs by adjusting the internal electronic properties and optimizing the preparation conditions, such as annealing temperature.86,87 For example, CuCrO2 nanocrystals have been proved to be a good HTL with improved stability, but very low conductivity and hole mobility.88 When CuCrO2 was doped with metal ions (Ni+, Ba2+, and Ca2+), gap oxygen could be inserted into CuCrO2 to promote the generation of holes, maintain the high stability and improve the efficiency of the CsPbBr3 PSCs (Fig. 4a and b).89 In addition, NiOx is usually used as the HTL in inverted PSCs.87 Recently, inverted CsPbIBr2 PSCs with Cs+ doped NiOx as the HTL could achieve better energy-level alignment and enhance hole conductivity (Fig. 4c and d). Ultimately, the optimized PSCs could reach a high efficiency of 9.49%.90

3. Interfacial modification
Except for charge transport materials, interfacial properties are also crucial for all-inorganic PSCs. Interfacial modification is an effective strategy to optimize interface properties. It helps to improve the charge dynamic at the interfaces without changing the inherent properties of CTLs or perovskite layers. Furthermore, all-inorganic PSCs have their special requirements for interfacial modification. For instance, due to the high-annealing temperature for most inorganic perovskites, the modification of the underlying interfaces should adopt materials with good thermal stability. The surface properties of the CTLs where perovskite forms have a great impact on the growth of perovskite, which gives us a direction to improve the formation of Cs-based inorganic perovskite films. Most importantly, optimized energy-level alignment and effective defect passivation are two primary conditions for high efficiency and stability PSCs. In this section, we summarize the recent progress on interfacial modification of all-inorganic PSCs. We mainly focus on the modification of CTLs and perovskite through a discussion of the impact of interfacial modification on defect passivation, energy-level alignment, perovskite crystal growth, and device stability.
3.1. Charge transport layer modifications
With respect to charge transport layers, ETLs have more species and possibilities than HTLs. Therefore, researchers did more studies on the modification of ETLs. Metal oxide ETLs are widely adopted in conventional n-i-p architecture all-inorganic PSCs due to their strong conductivity, high transmittance, and excellent thermal stability. Herein, we mainly focus on the modification of ETLs, and several classes of modification materials are summarized.

3.1.1. Hydroxides of alkali metals and alkali earth metals. 
Defect passivation is a common function of CTL modification to minimize the interface defects. Compared with organic passivating materials, inorganic passivating materials inherently have better thermal stability and can bear the high annealing temperature of the inorganic perovskite. Hydroxides of alkali metals and alkali earth metals have been proved to be efficient inorganic passivating materials for all-inorganic PSCs. Recently, Deng et al.91 used alkali hydroxides (KOH, NaOH) as interfacial modifiers in all-inorganic PSCs. The device architecture is shown in Fig. 5a. Alkali hydroxides could not only reduce the work function of the SnO2 ETL to achieve better band energy alignment at the interface, but also suppress halide ion migration, which reduced defect density at the SnO2/CsPbI2Br interface and inhibited J–V hysteresis. Moreover, the alkali metal ions at the SnO2/perovskite interface boosted the nucleation and growth of the perovskite films greatly. The schematic of interface interaction under light illumination is illustrated in Fig. 5b and c. The KBr-like compounds could compensate for the vacancy defects and simultaneously endow the KBr/KI-rich interface with superior passivation for interface defects. Likewise, Meng et al.92 incorporated a surface modifier barium hydroxide (Ba(OH)2) at the SnO2/CsPbI3 interface to reduce interface defects and suppress the nonradiative VOC losses. After further bulk passivation with trioctylphosphine oxide (TOPO), the VOC of device was enhanced from 0.87 to 1.17 V for a band gap of 1.78 eV. Modification with hydroxides did not incorporate halide ions and had negligible impact on device hysteresis. Other related hydroxides which are soluble may be used to modify the surface of the electron transport layer in conventional forward structured PSCs as well.

3.1.2. Inorganic metal halide salts. 
Most of the perovskite materials used in all-inorganic PSCs are prepared from a variety of halide salts such as CsI, PbBr2, etc. Inorganic metal halide salts also have excellent thermal stability. Until now, inorganic halide salts (SmBr3, CsBr and LiF) have been found to be effective surface modification materials. Cesium bromide (CsBr) itself is usually used as a raw material for inorganic perovskites. It has been found that the work function of TiO2 ETL could be decreased from 4.11 eV to 3.86 eV via CsBr post-treatment.93 This promoted a favorable band energy alignment of the TiO2/CsPbIBr2 heterojunction and enhanced the device efficiency to 10.71% with a high VOC of 1.261 V. CsBr salts would precipitate and aggregate to form clusters rather than a continuous film on the ETL after the evaporation of solvents. Moreover, the CsBr modifier had ignorable influence on the morphology, crystallinity and absorption property of the upper CsPbIBr2 layer. As for lanthanide bromide (SmBr3), lanthanides have been reported to be a valuable dopant for all-inorganic perovskite cells.57,94 Differently, Subhani and coworkers for the first time reported an interface modification strategy with a lanthanide halide (SmBr3) modifying the TiO2/CsPbIBr2 interface.95 Sm could partially replace Pb and existed in the form of SmBr6 octahedral in the CsPbIBr2 frame, which generated a hole-blocking gradient energy band at the interface (Fig. 5d). They also found that SmBr3 could act as nucleation sites so as to eliminate the heterogeneous nucleation phenomenon, and improve the crystallization and morphology of the perovskite film (Fig. 5e). Consequently, they attained a champion device with a PCE of 10.88% and an incredible growth of external quantum efficiency (EQE) (Fig. 5f). Recently, inorganic shunt-blocking layer lithium fluoride (LiF) has also been employed to modify the surface work function and passivate the defects of the SnO2 ETL, which significantly reduced the interfacial recombination in CsPbI3−xBrx-based PSCs.96 After further incorporating lead chloride (PbCl2) as an additive to perovskite, they attained an exhilarating PCE of 18.64% with a maximum VOC up to 1.25V.


3.1.3. Conventional charge transport materials. 
Generally, single charge transport layers, especially electron transport layers, tend to have imperfect performance due to unsuitable band alignment or poor film formation. In conventional hybrid PSCs, bilayer ETLs are usually adopted to enhance electron collection efficiency.97,98 SnO2 is a common electron extraction material with high electron mobility and excellent chemical stability. It can be easily fabricated through a low-temperature processing solution. However, the SnO2 film tends to have an imperfect coverage property due to the influence of processing methods and conditions. Guo et al.99 employed a SnCl2 solution to passivate SnO2 films and obtained a superior VOC of 1.31 V for CsPbIBr2-based PSCs. The pristine SnO2 layer was fabricated by SnO2 colloid (tin(IV) oxide) solution. After SnCl2 precursor treatment, an ultra-thin passivated SnO2 layer covered the pristine ETL. As a result, the new ETL had a smoother surface, and thus suppressed the interfacial recombination and reduced the energy loss (Eloss) in all-inorganic PSCs. ZnO is another electron extraction material with a better surface coverage and a higher-lying conduction band minimum (CBM) than SnO2. Modifying the SnO2 ETL with a ZnO interfacial layer could form an SnO2/ZnO bilayer ETL,50 which generated a desirable cascade energy level alignment at the ETL/CsPbI2Br interface (Fig. 6a). The charge extraction efficiency was thus enhanced (Fig. 6b) and Eloss at the interface was reduced. The stabilized efficiency of the device improved a lot (Fig. 6c). Likewise, fullerene (C60) and it derivative (PCBM) are usually applied as ETLs in inverted structured PSCs.100 The CBM of C60 is deeper than ZnO. Liu et al.101 modified ZnO films with a C60 layer and attained a PCE exceeding 13%. The C60 thin layer could not only fill the ZnO pinholes but also facilitate favorable gradient band alignment between CsPbI2Br and the C60-modified ZnO ETL. Consequently, the electron extraction efficiency of the ETL was enhanced and the PCE of devices based on the ZnO@C60 bilayer ETL was relatively higher than that of single ZnO/C60-based devices. Based on the merits of different electron transport layers, combining them together is a good choice but sometimes increases the preparation complexity because most of the ETLs are metal oxides.

3.1.4. Others. 
Graphene is a popular material with wide applications. It has very high electron mobility and good conductivity. Quantum dots (QDs) are a type of emerging nanomaterial with numerous physical and chemical properties. Graphene quantum dots (GQDs) combine the advantages of graphene and quantum dots, which possess outstanding conductivity and tiny size. Interfacial modification at the mesoscopic TiO2 (m-TiO2)/CsPbBr3 interface with ultra-thin GQDs was reported to be an effective method to enhance the efficiency and photo-stability of PSCs.102 The perovskite CsPbBr3 had a relatively high CBM and thus had a large energy barrier at the m-TiO2/CsPbBr3 interface. On the one hand, GQDs could tune the CBM of m-TiO2 and ensure better electron extraction from the CsPbBr3 film. On the other hand, GQDs could fill the gaps of m-TiO2 and reduce the surface defects of both the CsPbBr3 film and TiO2 ETL, which could suppress the photo-induced phase segregation of the CsPbBr3 film. Polymers are another class of materials with excellent thermal stability. Recently, Tian and coworkers simultaneously employed two kinds of polymers in CsPbI2Br-based PSCs.19 An amino-functionalized polymer (PN4N) acted as the surface passivation material for both the ETL and the perovskite film with the help of numerous amino groups (–NH2). In addition, an ultra-thin PN4N interlayer could tune the surface wetting properties of the SnO2 film and suppress heterogeneous nucleation, which ensured high-quality CsPbI2Br films with larger grain size and higher crystallinity (Fig. 6d). The photo-stability of the perovskite layer is greatly improved (Fig. 6e and f). After further introducing a conventional HTL poly5,5′-bis(2-butyloctyl)-(2,2′-bithiophene)-4,4′-dicarboxylate-alt-5,5′-2,2′-bithiophene (PDCBT) to passivate the upper surface of the perovskite, the champion PSC attained an excellent PCE over 16% and could hold over 90% of its initial efficiency under continuous 1 sun equivalent illumination for 400 hours. The reported studies about charge transport layer modifications discussed above are compiled in Table 2.

3.2. Perovskite modifications
As we discussed before, there is usually a large energy barrier between the perovskite active layer and CTLs due to the undesirable energy band alignment. One of the main purposes of interface engineering is to achieve a good energy alignment at the perovskite/CTL interface. In conventional n-i-p type all-inorganic PSCs, the doping density of ETLs is much higher than that of the perovskite. So the photocharges generated in the perovskite film are more remote to HTLs than to ETLs. The thick perovskite film increases light absorbance, but decreases the hole extraction efficiency at the perovskite/HTL interface and limits the device performance. Perovskite modification with an interfacial layer which has an appropriate bandgap between the perovskite and hole transport material, is a feasible method to reduce the energy barrier and enhance the hole collection efficiency, which can surely increase the device efficiency. As we know, the perovskite layer is one of the most important parts in PSCs. It is a permanent strategy to improve device performance through reducing the trap density and stabilizing the crystal phase in perovskite films. In addition, to extend the photoresponse of the light-harvesting layer is also an effective method. Finally, it should be noted that, no matter which method is used for perovskite modification, the destruction of perovskite films should be avoided as much as possible. Furthermore, several classes of materials for perovskite modification are summarized.

3.2.1. Quantum dots. 
In the above section, we mentioned that QDs have been utilized for CTL modification. Because of the easily tunable band gaps of QDs,103 QDs can also be used to modify the perovskite surface and improve the energy alignment for better charge collection. Moreover, QDs can also slightly absorb light and generate carriers. The band gaps of QDs are dominated by their sizes. So far, there have been many reports about perovskite modification with quantum dots. CuInS2/ZnS QDs (CISZ-QDs) are a kind of eco-friendly QDs which are free of highly toxic elements. The ZnS shell can protect the CuInS2 core from oxidation and enhance the air-stability of QDs. Ding et al.104 introduced CISZ-QDs to modify the CsPbBr3/carbon interface and remarkably improved the carrier collection. The sizes of QDs could be precisely controlled via reaction temperature and time adjustment. The same group also reported a work on CsPbBr3 PSCs which could harvest both the solar and water-stream energies.105 To avoid the moisture attack on the CsPbBr3 film, they incorporated CISZ-QDs which were decorated with hydrophobic long alkyl chains to protect them from degradation. This interfacial modification not only enhanced charge extraction, but also enhanced the humidity stability of PSCs. The champion device could retain 98% of its initial efficiency after storing under high-humidity conditions (80% RH, 25 °C) for 40 days.
Perovskite QDs have attracted enormous attention in the fields of light-harvesting and emitting devices. The bandgap of perovskite QDs can be tuned easily by adjusting the halide ions, which is similar to that of perovskites. Lead-free CsSnBr3−xIx QDs have been synthesized to form an intermediate energy level at the CsPbBr3/carbon interface.106 The band of CsSnBr3−xIx QDs can be tuned by tailoring the stoichiometric Br:I ratio. CsSnBr2I QDs possessed a better band alignment with the CsPbBr3 layer in contrast to CsSnI3 QDs, CsSnBrI2 QDs and CsSnBr3 QDs. The charge extraction of devices was thus promoted. For a perovskite with different dimensions, as the dimension decreased, the bandgap will increase correspondingly. Zhang et al.107 reported a PSC with a photo-harvest layer of multidimensional (3D-2D-0D) CsPbI2Br (Fig. 7a), where 3D is bulk perovskite, 2D is nanosheets and 0D is QDs. They found ethyl acetate (EA) treatment could effectively remove organic residues on the 2D/0D surface and reduce the effect of radiative electron–hole recombination arising from the 2D/0D addition in assembled films. Fig. 7b shows the energy-level diagram of these PSCs. The multi-graded perovskite structure enhanced hole extraction and conduction efficiency. The photovoltaic performance of CsPbI2Br PCSs was improved after introducing the graded interface (Fig. 7c). From J–V curves in Fig. 7c, it was obvious that the J–V curve of 3D-0D device was very close to the multi-graded device. Via post-treatment of the 3D-0D CsPbI2Br heterojunction with organic iodine salt (FAI), the device could reach a long-term stabilized efficiency over 14%.108 Firstly, FAI could passivate the QD surface and result in a high-quality QD film. Secondly, the formation of an ultrathin I-enriched FA+ CsPbX3 could not only passivate the grain boundaries of the CsPbI2Br film but also induce a band edge bending at the interface. Furthermore, when the perovskite QD layer became thicker and reached a thickness of about 300 nm, the PSCs could be seen to possess a bilayer photoactive layer (Fig. 7d). The optimized CsPbI3 QDs layer could slightly broaden the spectral absorption of the main absorber CsPbI2Br layer and facilitate a well-matched energy band (Fig. 7e and f).109 Except for quantum dots, many other materials with a suitable bandgap and good charge transport ability were also introduced for perovskite modification. Herein, we do not talk in detail any more.

3.2.2. Perovskite derivative-phase. 
In the deposition process of the inorganic perovskite active layer, we sometimes can find the existence of the perovskite derivative-phase. Particularly in the CsPbBr3 film, several useful derivative-phases have been explored. It has been found that the presence of inorganic perovskite derivative-phases had two merits: strong absorption in the UV region and sufficient stability.110 Li et al.111 for the first time adopted a vapor deposition approach to fabricate CsPbBr3 PSCs containing a derivative-phase CsPb2Br5. By properly controlling the film thickness of CsBr and PbBr2, they obtained the champion device with superior stability losing only 10% efficiency after 1000 h exposure to humidity (45% RH). The derivative-phase CsPb2Br5 spread between the interface of the CsPbBr3 grains and led to the band-edge bending (Fig. 8a and b), which facilitated electron injection to the ETL and reduced the recombination at the perovskite/HTL interface. Moreover, the presence of CsPb2Br5 could reduce the defect density of the perovskite/ETL interface and enhanced the EQE in the violet region (Fig. 8c). The ultra-stable CsPb2Br5 protected CsPbBr3 well and improved the operational stability of devices. Furthermore, introducing another derivative-phase Cs4PbBr6 to form a CsPbBr3/CsPbBr3-CsPb2Br5/CsPbBr3-Cs4PbBr6 gradient bandgap structure could further improve the device efficiency and stability.112 Likewise, Bai et al.113 incorporated 0D Cs4PbI6 as a wrapping layer for CsPbI3 perovskite and improved the phase stability. The derivative-phase Cs4PbI6 surrounded around CsPbI3 grain boundaries had a good passivation effect. In addition, the existence of Cs4PbI6 could control the perovskite grain size and hinder phase transformation to some extent. The optimized device had a high PCE of 16.39% and could almost retain its initial PCE under continuous illumination (AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2, room temperature) in a nitrogen-filled glovebox for 500 h.

3.2.3. Other light-harvesting materials. 
Usually, due to the wide bandgap, CsPbBr3 and CsPbIBr2 perovskites tend to have narrow light absorption spectra, which cause the poor light absorption ability and low PCE of devices. If the spectral absorption can be broadened, it is hopeful to further enhance the efficiency of the corresponding PSCs. Bulk heterojunctions (BHJ) are light-harvesting layers in organic photovoltaics (OPVs).114 SnS:ZnS BHJ had been used as a interfacial layer at the CsPbBr3/HTL (NiOx) interface.81 As a result, the light absorption range of PSCs was extended from 550 nm to 700 nm and a champion PCE of 10.26% was obtained. Likewise, dye-sensitized solar cells are another classical type of photovoltaics and the dye molecule YD2-o-C8 is a kind of excellent light harvester employed widely in them. The full name of YD2-o-C8 is 5,15-bis(2,6-dioctoxyphenyl)-10-(bis(4-hexylphenyl)-amino-20-4-carboxyphenylethynyl)porphyrin-atozinc(II). Yang et al.115 formed an YD2-o-C8 thin-layer on a CsPbIBr2 layer (Fig. 8d and e) and broadened the light absorption range from 600 nm to 680 nm (Fig. 8f). Furthermore, the dye molecule could improve the morphology of the perovskite film through compensating the surface pinholes. Finally, the optimized PSC attained a record-high VOC of 1.37 V.


3.2.4. Surface organic passivation materials. 
Although perovskite materials have good tolerance to defects, high-density charged defects will trap carriers and induce energy loss, which hinders the improvement of device efficiency. Usually, these defects can interact with water molecules in the atmosphere and accelerate the degradation of perovskites. It is especially true for all-inorganic perovskites due to their high sensitivity to moisture. Besides, all-inorganic perovskites also have the serious issue of crystal stability, especially for the CsPbI3 perovskite. CsPbI3 is the most promising candidate in all-inorganic PSCs due to its suitable bandgap.116 However, the cubic CsPbI3 (α-phase) has poor phase stability and undergoes thermodynamic phase transition to the useless orthorhombic phase (δ phase) under ambient conditions. Though other all-inorganic perovskites have better thermodynamic phase stability than CsPbI3, they are still fragile when facing moisture in ambient environment.
Luckily, multiple surface organic passivation materials have been successfully adopted for defect passivation and better crystal stability of all-inorganic perovskites so far. Functional groups (CO, PO, C–N and –NH2, etc.) in passivation materials can effectively passivate uncoordinated Pb ions or exposed Cs ions with their lone electron cloud. For instance, Li et al.117 incorporated polymer poly-vinylpyrrolidone (PVP) to perovskite precursor solution and obtained stabilized cubic CsPbI3. Polymers are a good additive which can bear the high annealing temperature of CsPbI3. Acylamino groups of PVP could control the nucleation and growth of cubic CsPbI3 layer via the interactions between N–CO groups and Cs ions exposed on the perovskite surface. This interaction also reduced the surface tension of grains greatly and realized devices with outstanding thermal and moisture stability. Recently, commercially available poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) has been employed to passivate trap states and acted as HTMs in CsPbI2Br films.118 The sulfur (S) atoms in P3HT could bond with under-coordinated Cs+ ions and Pb2+ ions, which made electron distribution delocalized and reduced charge recombination loss (Fig. 9a). Compared with CsPbI2Br PSCs based on conventional spiro-OMeTAD HTMs, the VOC of PSCs based on P3HT was larger and could reach 1.32 V with an Eloss down to 0.5 eV (Fig. 9b).

Indeed, organic ligands which have a high electron cloud density were often used to interact with negatively charged traps of perovskite and enhance phase stability. Recently, Wu et al.119 designed three organic molecules (OTG1, OTG2, and OTG3) to suppress the moisture-induced lattice distortion of cubic CsPbI3. These molecules contained two parts: bulk alkyl chains and an anchoring group. A thiophene based π-spacer was employed to suppress the thermal decomposition of organic molecules during the high-temperature annealing process.120 The molecule OTG3 had the best stabilization effect to cubic CsPbI3 because of its longer alkyl chains (Fig. 9c). The large 2,4-dibutoxy phenyl unit made OTG3 with a strong steric hindrance effect to maintain the angle of the corner-sharing PbI64− frameworks (180°) and inhibit phase transition. The contrast of the cubic phase of CsPbI3 with and without OTG3 in the presence of water molecules is shown in Fig. 9d and e. The phase-stabilized PSCs could maintain 85% of their initial efficiency after storing for 30 days under ambient conditions (Fig. 9f). Similarly, another simple molecular passivation strategy that adopted π-conjugated 6TIC-4F with a strong electron-donating core terthieno3,2-bthiophene (6T) and two electron-withdrawing units 2-(5,6-difluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene)malononitrile (IC-2F) for the surface defect passivation of the CsPbIxBr3−x film was reported.121 The nitrile (C–N) groups on 6TIC-4F could passivate the Pb-exposed surface so as to suppress the nonradiative recombination in all-inorganic PSCs greatly. Consequently, the inverted CsPbIxBr3−x-based PSCs reached a champion efficiency of 16.1% with improved photostability. In addition to the above passivation agents, surface terminated organic cations (FA+ and PEA+) were also employed to the interfacial modification of inorganic perovskite films and improved the crystal stability with the aid of amino groups.108,122
Compared with cubic α-CsPbI3, tetragonal β-CsPbI3 has a more stable lattice structure and a wider spectral response. Wang et al.10 reported a work with choline iodine (CHI) modifying the surface of a highly crystalline β-CsPbI3 film. CHI with both positive and negative charges could passivate the positively and negatively charged defects simultaneously. It filled the cracks and pinholes of the CsPbI3 film and reduced nonradiative carrier recombination effectively. Furthermore, it tailored the band structure of perovskite and achieved a better energy-level alignment at both the CsPbI3/TiO2 interface and the CsPbI3/spiro interface. As a result, both the VOC and FF of devices increased significantly and the stabilized PCE could reach 18.4%. Similarly, the same group also post-treated the β-CsPbI3 film with phenyltrimethylammonium chloride (PTACl) and obtained a record efficiency beyond 19% with high photo-stability.123 The PTACl-CsPbI3 based PSCs could retain 90% of their initial PCE after 500 h continuous illumination. Perovskite modification with organic functional materials is a facile approach to maximize the interface kinetics and enhance the perovskite crystal stability in all-inorganic PSCs. The recently reported studies discussed above and some others about perovskite modification are compiled in Table 3.124–127

4. Conclusion and perspective
Since interface engineering has been used for many years, nearly every researcher knows the crucial role of interfaces in PSCs. Interfaces influence the device efficiency and stability significantly. In this review, we focus on the recent progress of interface engineering in all-inorganic PSCs. All-inorganic PSCs have become one of the most popular research in perovskite-based photovoltaics due to their high open-circuit voltages and good device stability. Wide band gaps of inorganic perovskites result in narrow spectral response and bad energy-level alignment with conventional charge transport materials. Numerous defects in perovskite films and CTLs cause severe nonradiative interface recombination and poor photoelectric properties. Therefore, energy-level alignment and defect passivation are two primary purposes of interface engineering. We have summarized the strategies of interface engineering from two aspects: charge transport materials and interfacial modification. In the case of charge transport materials, we need to dope traditional CTMs with metal elements or organic additives, which can enhance conductivity and optimize energy-level architecture, to meet new demands of all-inorganic PSCs. As for interfacial modification, alkali hydroxides, alkaline earth metal hydroxides, inorganic metal halide salts, graphene quantum dots, and polymers have been applied to the surface treatment of CTLs. Moreover, bilayer ETLs has been utilized to enhance charge carrier extraction. Except for defect passivation and band alignment, interfacial layers sometimes can improve the quality of perovskite films and suppress ion migration. Meanwhile, quantum dots, organic small molecules, surface terminated organic cations, perovskite derivative-phases, polymer and other light-harvesting materials have also been employed for perovskite modification, which raised the efficiency and device stability to a new level. All these strategies of interface engineering have promoted the development of all-inorganic PSCs greatly in recent years. Compared with organic–inorganic hybrid PSCs, the highest certified efficiency for all-inorganic PSCs is just 18.3% and still lower substantially.10 Furthermore, long-term stability is the largest challenge which hinders the commercial application of PSCs. Therefore, for the purpose of fully reaching the potential of all-inorganic PSCs, interface strategies mentioned in the review need to be deeply studied and novel interface strategies should be developed. In addition, more low-cost and easily processable materials should also be employed in devices to promote the commercialization of all-inorganic PSCs.
