    , Accepted 13th June 2021First published on 17th June 2021AbstractDual phototherapy combining photodynamic therapy (PDT) and photothermal therapy (PTT) is considered to be a more effective therapeutic method against cancer than single treatment. Therefore, the development of a single material with both near-infrared (NIR)-laser-triggered PDT and PTT abilities is highly desirable but remains a great challenge. A design philosophy for photosensitizers for integrated PDT and PTT treatment has been put forward: (1) a high molar extinction coefficient in the NIR region; (2) suitable LUMO and T1 energy levels to regulate intersystem crossing for effective singlet oxygen (1O2) generation for PDT; and (3) the suppression of fluorescence emission to enhance the process of nonradiative transition with appropriate chemical modifications. Herein, an “all-in-one” functional material, di-cyan substituted 5,12-dibutylquinacridone (DCN-4CQA), for diagnosis and therapy was obtained. DCN-4CQA possesses dual-functional phototherapeutic activity and NIR fluorescence and it was produced via a facile synthesis process from the classic organic photoelectric material quinacridone. We then prepared smart water-soluble nanoparticles (NPs), DCN-4CQA/F127, using Pluronic® 127 (F127) as a drug carrier. The NPs exhibited excellent biocompatibility, robust photostability, NIR fluorescence, a high photothermal conversion efficiency (η = 47.3%), and sufficient 1O2 generation (ΦΔ = 24.3%) under NIR laser irradiation. Remarkably, the DCN-4CQA/F127 NPs significantly inhibited tumor growth in mice subjected to NIR laser irradiation. This study provides a new route for the development of highly efficient, low-cytotoxicity photosensitizers for fluorescence-imaging-guided PTT/PDT.
Introduction
Cancer is an intractable disease in the medical field that seriously threatens human health.1 Existing cancer treatment methods, including chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and surgery, do not achieve satisfactory results due to their poor therapeutic efficiency and obvious side effects.2 Photodynamic therapy (PDT) and photothermal therapy (PTT) have been recognized as major modalities of phototherapy for malignant tumors, and hold the potential to overcome these limitations owing to their high controllability, localizability and therapeutic specificity.3,4 The nontoxic sensitizing agents used in the PDT and PTT processes usually absorb in the harmless near-infrared (NIR) wavelength range and achieve good penetration depths.5 In the PDT process, the photosensitizers produce reactive oxygen species, (ROS) such as singlet oxygen (1O2), the hydroxyl radical (OH˙), the superoxide anion radical (O2˙−), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), etc., under NIR laser irradiation.6–11 The PTT process instead converts the energy from irradiation to localized heat via non-radiative attenuation by the photoabsorbers, resulting in cancer cell apoptosis.12,13 The combination of PTT and PDT in a single multifunctional platform for cancer therapy has received growing attention due to their enhanced synergistic effects.14,15 However, such approaches usually require multiple steps, complex components, sophisticated construction, and two or more different laser wavelengths to achieve an accurate treatment.16 Therefore, the development of a combined PDT/PTT treatment based on a single-component system using a single laser source is desirable. NIR fluorescence imaging methods can be used to image diseased tissue and assess therapeutic efficacy, and thus exhibit the ability to enhance the accuracy of tumor therapy.17,18 Consequently, developing a highly efficient theranostic platform via the rational design and synthesis of an “all-in-one” phototheranostic for fluorescence imaging-guided PDT/PTT synergistic therapy deserves extensive research in order to achieve ideal diagnostic accuracy as well as complete and accurate tumor elimination using a single NIR irradiation stimulus.
In recent years, great efforts have been devoted to the design of multifunctional photosensitizers for single-component, NIR-triggered, and combined PDT/PTT therapy. Numerous difunctional materials have been developed.19,20 The overall design concepts are as follows: (1) modify the molecular structure to obtain a high molar absorption coefficient in the NIR region; (2) suitably modulate the HOMO–LUMO distribution to reduce the energy gap (ΔEST) between the lowest excited singlet state (S1) and the lowest triplet state (T1) for effective inter-system crossing (ISC) and conversion of ground-state oxygen (3O2) into singlet oxygen (1O2); (3) enhance the NIR photothermal conversion efficiency by promoting the dissipation of the excitation energy through non-radiative pathways.21–24
Organic semiconductor materials are attractive because of their low toxicity, good biocompatibility, superior photoelectric performance and high flexibility in the modification of their physical/chemical properties.25–27 Quinacridone (QA) and its derivatives are classic multifunctional organic semiconductor materials that are known for their good optoelectronic properties and high thermal/chemical stabilities.28–30 They have been widely used for chemosensors,31 organic light emitting diodes,32–34 field effect transistors,35,36 and organic photovoltaics.37–39 Our previous work reported a novel acceptor material based on a QA derivative organic molecule for organic bulk heterojunction solar cells.44 The small molecule exhibits simple synthesis, solution processability, and relatively stable features. More importantly, the organic molecule shows the ability to generate hyperthermia and singlet oxygen and good application prospects in the phototherapy of tumors. In addition, the application of QA derivatives in this area is rarely reported. The di-cyano substituted 5,12-dibutylquinacridone (DCN-4CQA) has been developed under these circumstances. With the strongly electron-withdrawing –CN groups, DCN-4CQA showed enhanced intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) features with a significant shift of its absorption band to the NIR region and the quenching of its fluorescence.40,41 In the solid state, DCN-4CQA exhibits a dark green color with a high molar extinction coefficient, a low fluorescence quantum yield of 1.0%, and a suitable ΔEST value of 0.87 eV, which satisfy all the key requirements for dual-phototherapy agents.42,43 Therefore, DCN-4CQA was selected as a dual-phototherapy agent in this study. The commercial amphiphilic polymer Pluronic® 127 (F127) was used as a drug carrier to prepare the water-soluble nanoparticles (NPs) DCN-4CQA/F127. The resulting DCN-4CQA/F127 NPs showed NIR fluorescence, robust photostability, high photothermal conversion efficiency (η = 47.3%) and good quantum yield for 1O2 generation (ΦΔ = 24.3%). In vitro and in vivo tests also proved its excellent anticancer efficacy guided by fluorescence imaging, showing the good potential of this “all-in-one” phototheranostic. As detailed below, DCN-4CQA/F127 enabled a fluorescence-guided PTT/PDT system to realize safe, high-efficacy, and accurate cancer treatment.
Experimental
Materials
All reagents and solvents, unless otherwise specified, were obtained from Aldrich (USA) and Acros (Belgium), and were used as received.
All reactions were carried out using Schlenk techniques under a nitrogen atmosphere. DCN-4CQA was synthesized as follows, where 4C-QA was prepared according to the reported method.44
Synthesis of DCN-4CQA
4C-QA (2.0 g, 4.7 mmol) and malononitrile (0.75 g, 11.3 mmol) were dissolved in freshly distilled acetic anhydride (50 mL). Under a nitrogen atmosphere, the solution was stirred and heated to reflux for 10 h. After cooling to room temperature, the solvent was removed by vacuum evaporation and the crude product was purified by column chromatography using silica gel with CH2Cl2 as the eluent to obtain DCN-4CQA (500 mg, yield: 20%). 1H NMR (300 MHz, CDCl3, δ): 8.60 (s, 2H), 8.56 (d, J = 8.3 Hz, 2H), 7.76 (t, J = 8.0 Hz, 2H), 7.51 (d, J = 8.7 Hz, 2H), 7.35 (t, J = 7.5 Hz, 2H), 4.48 (t, J = 8.4 Hz, 4H), 2.10–1.95 (m, 4H), 1.76–1.62 (m, 4H), 1.15 (t, J = 7.5 Hz, 6H).

Results and discussion
Molecular design and the DFT calculation of ΔEST
The starting material 5,12-dibutylquinacridone (4CQA) was synthesized according to our previous work.44 4CQA was reacted with malononitrile in the solvent acetic anhydride to obtain DCN-4CQA via facile synthesis. The crude product was first purified by column chromatography and then by sublimation, ensuring high purity. Its chemical structure was confirmed using 1H NMR spectroscopy (Fig. S1, ESI†). The absorption peak in the UV-vis absorption spectrum of DCN-4CQA in tetrahydrofuran (THF) is located at around 634 nm and has a high molar extinction coefficient (5.9 × 104 L mol−1 cm−1) (Fig. 1A and Fig. S2, ESI†). Additionally, DCN-4CQA, which has strong ICT, shows weak fluorescence with a low fluorescence quantum yield (Φ = 1.0%) (Fig. 1B), which is beneficial to enhance nonradiative decay for robust photothermal conversion.45 Alternatively, the strong ICT could result in the separation of the HOMO–LUMO distribution and reduced ΔEST, which induces ROS generation.46 Therefore, these features are favorable for dual phototherapy PTT and PDT, as they could allow the production of heat and ROS for a potential tumor therapeutic effect.47 The energy levels of the HOMO and LUMO and the ΔEST of DCN-4CQA are −5.62, −3.16, and 0.87 eV, respectively, as obtained from density functional theory (DFT) calculations (Fig. 1C and D).

Formation and properties of the DCN-4CQA/F127 NPs
With the goal of effective application in the biological field, the lipophilic DCN-4CQA was directly encapsulated into Pluronic® 127 (F127) using a nanoprecipitation method to form water-soluble DCN-4CQA/F127 NPs after dialysis for fluorescence-guided PTT/PDT application as shown in Scheme 1. The absorption of the DCN-4CQA/F127 NPs shows a hypochromic shift compared to that of DCN-4CQA dissolved in THF, with a broad absorption in the range of 550–800 nm, which may be due to H aggregation of DCN-4CQA molecules.48 The molar extinction coefficient of the DCN-4CQA/F127 NPs was calculated to be 2.1 × 104 L mol−1 cm−1, which may be due to aggregation of the DCN-4CQA molecules. Due to the intense ICT, the DCN-4CQA/F127 NPs display weak red fluorescence with a very low fluorescence quantum yield, which will significantly benefit both PTT and PDT.

The dynamic light scattering (DLS) results revealed that the DCN-4CQA/F127 NPs have an average hydrodynamic diameter of 103.7 nm (Fig. 1E), revealing their additional passive tumor-targeting ability via the enhanced permeation and retention (EPR) effect. The morphology of the DCN-4CQA/F127 NPs was characterized utilizing transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The DCN-4CQA/F127 NPs show a uniform spherical morphology with an average diameter of around 99.2 ± 6.4 nm (Fig. 1F).
Photothermal effect of the DCN-4CQA/F127 NPs
Given the efficient photon absorption of the DCN-4CQA/F127 NPs in the region of 550–750 nm, we next investigated the photothermal effect of the NPs in PBS for PTT under 655 nm laser irradiation. As expected, Fig. 2A indicates that the temperatures of DCN-4CQA/F127 NP solutions with different concentrations (from 25.0 to 75.0 μg mL−1) increased in a concentration-dependent manner under exposure to a 655 nm continuous NIR laser at 1.0 W cm−2. The temperature of the DCN-4CQA/F127 NPs at a concentration of 75.0 μg mL−1 increased quickly to above 65.1 °C (ΔT = 41.9 °C) within 10 min of laser irradiation. It was found that even a low concentration of DCN-4CQA/F127 NPs (25.0 μg mL−1 based on DCN-4CQA) demonstrated effective heating to 54.8 °C under the same conditions, which exceeded 45.0 °C, the lowest temperature to burn tumor cells.49 In contrast, PBS did not show a significant temperature change (Fig. S3, ESI†), indicating that these NPs have effective photothermal conversion ability. Furthermore, photothermal stability is a key factor for phototherapeutic therapy; the photothermal stability results are shown in Fig. 2B and C. When the DCN-4CQA/F127 NPs (25.0 μg mL−1 based on DCN-4CQA) were irradiated with a 655 nm continuous laser at 1.0 W cm−2 for 20 min, the highest NP temperature was over 60.0 °C. Almost no change in the maximum temperature was observed after five laser on/off cycles; the difference was only about 3% (Fig. 2B). When the laser irradiation time was extended to 4 h under the same laser intensity and concentration conditions, the temperature reached 59.0–60.0 °C (Fig. 2C), suggesting that the DCN-4CQA/F127 NPs can retain excellent photothermal stability. The photothermal conversion efficiency of NPs is another essential factor. The photothermal conversion efficiency of the DCN-4CQA/F127 NPs was calculated to be 47.3% using the reported method,50 which is approximately 14-fold higher than that of ICG (∼3.1%) (Fig. S4, ESI†). Additionally, in this study, the photothermal effect of the NPs at different concentrations and under different laser power densities was also measured using infrared (IR) thermal images, as shown in Fig. 2D and E. When the concentration of DCN-4CQA/F127 NPs was 90.0 μg mL−1, the temperature of the solution increased quickly to over 70.0 °C upon 655 nm laser light irradiation (1.0 W cm−2, 10 min) (Fig. 2D). Fig. 2E clearly reveals that the maximum temperature of the DCN-4CQA/F127 NP solutions increased obviously with increasing laser light density (from 0.6–1.2 W cm−2), indicating that the increase in the temperature is related to the power density of the laser.

(D) IR thermal images of DCN-4CQA/F127 NPs in PBS at different concentrations (CDCN-4CQA = 0–90.0 μg mL−1) under 655 nm irradiation at 1.0 W cm−2.

Photodynamic effects of DCN-4CQA/F127 NPs
ROS are considered to be the significant cytotoxic agents in PDT. Hence, we evaluated the ROS generation of DCN-4CQA/F127 NPs under a 655 nm laser beam by monitoring the absorption of the well-established chemical detector 1,3-diphenylisobenzofuran (DPBF), which can react with ROS to generate DPBF endoperoxide, leading to a decrease in the absorption intensity at about 419 nm. The UV/vis spectra of DPBF in the presence of DCN-4CQA after 655 nm laser exposure (1.0 W cm−2) from 0 to 15 s are shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†). The typical absorption wavelength of DPBF at 419 nm decreased obviously with the concentration of DCN-4CQA at 5.0 μg mL−1. The absorption intensity decreased about 34.0% within 15 s. However, under the same laser irradiation, there was no obvious degradation of DPBF without DCN-4CQA, demonstrating that DCN-4CQA can generate ROS efficiently to consume DPBF in this case. The relative absorbance of DPBF under the above two conditions was also recorded over 15 s (Fig. S5, ESI†). Subsequently, the ROS generation of DCN-4CQA in different environments was also detected. Moreover, electron spin resonance (ESR) spectra were used as the most direct evidence to verify the type of ROS. 2,2,6,6-Tetramethylpiperidine (TEMP) was applied as a singlet oxygen (1O2) detector to monitor the type of ROS generated by DCN-4CQA under 655 nm laser light. Fig. 3A shows that the spectrum of DCN-4CQA clearly displays a 1:1:1 triplet signal under 655 nm laser irradiation, which was attributed to 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-N-oxyl (TEMPO), suggesting the existence of 1O2. However, the ESR spectrum of DCN-4CQA exhibited no signal without localized 655 nm laser exposure. In addition, 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO) under NIR laser irradiation in the absence of DCN-4CQA was also utilized to test the possible generation of other ROS. There was no ESR signal, indicating that ROS (1O2) were only generated by DCN-4CQA under the laser beam (Fig. 3A). The ΦΔ of DCN-4CQA was also calculated to be about 24.3% using the standard methylene blue (MB) (Fig. S6, ESI†). In addition, the 1O2 generation from DCN-4CQA was further evaluated by taking advantage of fluorescence microscopy. 2,7-Dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) was used as an indicator and incubated with HeLa cells. Nonfluorescent DCFH-DA can be hydrolyzed to 2′,7′dichlorofluorescein (DCF), which emits intense green fluorescence, in the presence of 1O2. HeLa cells incubated with the DCN-4CQA/F127 NPs and DCFH-DA displayed obvious green fluorescence under a 655 nm laser beam. However, there was no obvious fluorescence in the control experiments (control, DCN-4CQA/F127 NPs only, DCFH-DA + laser) (Fig. 3B). These results revealed that 1O2 can be efficiently generated in the presence of DCN-4CQA/F127 NPs under a 655 nm laser beam (1.0 W cm−2, 10 min).

(G) Cytotoxic effects of DCN-4CQA/F127 NPs on HeLa cells after controlling the temperature of cells to less than 30 °C using an ice bath during laser treatment. P values were calculated using a two-way ANOVA test (*P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001). 
Cytotoxicity and PTT/PDT of DCN-4CQA NPs in vitro
To verify the synergistic phototherapeutic performance mediated by DCN-4CQA/F127 NPs in vitro, HeLa cells were incubated with different concentrations of these NPs (from 5.0 to 75.0 μg mL−1) for 24 h under dark conditions. Fig. 3C shows that the cell viability was more than 90.0% even at high DCN-4CQA/F127 NPs concentration (75.0 μg mL−1), as examined using a standard MTT assay, indicating that the DCN-4CQA/F127 NPs have a low cytotoxicity, which is beneficial for biomedical applications. Next, the cell viability when exposed to a corresponding light (655 nm, 1.0 W cm−2) for 20 min in the presence of NPs was assessed. Fig. 3D shows that more cells were killed with increasing DCN-4CQA/F127 NPs concentration. More than 88.0% HeLa cell apoptosis was observed in the presence of NPs (CDCN-4CQA = 75.0 μg mL−1) under 655 nm laser irradiation (1.0 W cm−2, 20 min). All the observations from the MTT assays clearly demonstrated that the crucial synergistic effect for dual tumor phototherapy could be achieved with the DCN-4CQA/F127 NPs. The therapeutic effect of PTT/PDT was also evaluated by using calcein-AM (excited at 488 nm) and propidium iodide (PI, excited at 561 nm) to label live and dead cells, respectively. Green fluorescence was displayed in the control group, indicating the low cytotoxicity and good biocompatibility of the DCN-4CQA/F127 NPs (CDCN-4CQA = 75.0 μg mL−1). However, red fluorescence was visualized under 655 nm NIR light energy (1.0 W cm−2, 20 min), suggesting that most tumor cells were killed by the PTT/PDT effects of the DCN-4CQA/F127 NPs (Fig. 3E). Furthermore, in order to investigate the photodynamic-only performance in vitro, we used an ice-bath to cool the environmental temperature of the cells to lower than 30.0 °C during laser irradiation according to previous reports. As shown in Fig. 3F, 40% of HeLa cells were killed under 655 nm laser irradiation in the presence of DCN-4CQA/F127 (25.0 μg mL−1) without any special ice-bath treatment. When the ice-bath was used to cool the environmental temperature, the cell death rate was less than 20%, showing a relatively low PDT capability (Fig. 3G). Thus, the improved therapeutic efficiency of the DCN-4CQA/F127 NPs is attributed to PTT/PDT co-treatment.
Fluorescence imaging of DCN-4CQA/F127 NPs
Additionally, the inherent fluorescence of the DCN-4CQA/F127 NPs prompted us to observe their intracellular distribution. The nuclei was stained utilizing the fluorescent agent DAPI. Fig. 4A presents the fluorescence images of the DCN-4CQA/F127 NPs (50.0 μg mL−1, 2.0 mL) in HeLa cells after 12 h of incubation. As expected, the bright red fluorescence showed that the DCN-4CQA/F127 NPs were mostly accumulated in the cytoplasm of the cell, also demonstrating that the DCN-4CQA/F127 NPs exhibited good uptake in cancer cells. Then, the feasibility of these NPs for NIR FL imaging and major organs detection in vivo was evaluated. The mice were administered a dose corresponding to 75.0 μg mL−1 of DCN-4CQA (0.2 mL) via intravenous (i.v.) injection and then subjected to fluorescence imaging. Fig. 4B shows that the fluorescence of the DCN-4CQA/F127 NPs was observed throughout the body after 4 h, and the fluorescence intensity weakened after 24 h. Furthermore, 48 h post-injection, the major organs (heart, lung, liver, spleen, and kidneys) of the mice were collected for ex vivo fluorescence imaging. As presented in Fig. 4C, it was found that the fluorescence signal of the DCN-4CQA NPs was mainly distributed in the liver and kidneys. As time elapsed, the fluorescence signal decreased gradually, suggesting that the DCN-4CQA NPs can be excreted through both the biliary mechanism and urethral system.

To verify the ability of the DCN-4CQA/F127 NPs to generate hyperthermia in vivo, DCN-4CQA/F127 NPs in PBS (containing 75.0 μg mL−1 DCN-4CQA, 200 μL) were injected into the 4T1 tumor-bearing mice via intratumoral injection. The mice were then treated with 655 nm laser irradiation at 1.0 W cm−2 for 20 min. The temperature increase in the tumor surface site under localized NIR laser irradiation was monitored using a thermal camera (Fig. 5A). The temperature of the tumor region increased to 79.4 °C, whereas there was no obvious temperature change in the thermal imaging of mice without any treatment under the same laser irradiation conditions, indicating that the DCN-4CQA/F127 NPs can generate adequate hyperthermia to burn cancer cells (Fig. S7, ESI†). To further evaluate the actual therapeutic effect of the DCN-4CQA/F127 NPs in vivo, tumor-bearing mice were divided into four groups (a: DCN-4CQA/F127 + laser; b: laser; c: PBS; d: DCN-4CQA/F127) for different therapies. The tumor sites of the mice were exposed to a 655 nm laser beam at 1.0 W cm−2 for 20 min. The weight and tumor sizes of the mice were recorded every 2 days over 14 days after the irradiation of each group (Fig. 5B and C). Additionally, slight growth was observed in all the treatment groups, demonstrating that the DCN-4CQA/F127 NPs were well tolerated in vivo. Similarly to the PBS group (control group), the DCN-4CQA/F127-NP-only and corresponding light-only groups hardly presented any inhibiting effect on the tumor growth, demonstrating that they had no cancer treatment effect. In contrast, for the DCN-4CQA/F127 + laser treatment group, tumor growth was hampered within only 14 days, exhibiting the potential ability of the NPs to kill cancer cells with NIR light energy via synergistic hyperthermia and 1O2. Representative photographs of the mice after different treatments for 14 days are presented in Fig. S8 (ESI†), which further shows the ideal PTT/PDT co-therapy effect of the DCN-4CQA/F127 NPs.

Ex vivo histology examinations
For a prolonged in vivo toxicity observation using hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, the DCN-4CQA/F127 NPs (CDCN-4CQA = 40.0 μg mL−1) were injected intratumorally into tumor-bearing mice. After 14 days, the results shown in Fig. 6 clearly indicate that the synergistic heat and 1O2 generated by the DCN-4CQA/F127 NPs upon localized laser exposure (1.0 W cm−2, 20 min) could result in extensive tumor tissue shrinkage, necrosis and apoptosis of cells with pyknosis, karyorrhexis, and karyolysis of the nucleus, as well as changed cell shapes, which were more numerous and densely arranged than in the control group. On the contrary, no obvious damage to the PBS group, DCN-4CQA/F127-only group, or corresponding-light-only (control groups) were found. Furthermore, the major organs, including the liver and kidneys, also exhibited no obvious inflammation or injury in the histological examination. These results further prove the lack of noticeable systemic toxicity and the effective combined inhibition effect on tumor growth of the DCN-4CQA/F127 NPs. Thus, the current treatment method demonstrates that DCN-4CQA/F127 NPs can serve as an efficient therapeutic agent for imaging-guided PDT/PTT treatment.

Conclusions
In our work, organic multifunctional therapeutic agent DCN-4CQA/F127 NPs were successfully constructed for tumor-imaging-guided PDT/PTT to achieve the goal of “all in one” therapy. The ICT of the DCN-4CQA molecules was enhanced via modification with the strongly electron-withdrawing -CN group, which not only causes the absorption band to significantly redshift to the NIR region but also inhibits the fluorescence emission pathway, thereby enhancing the photothermal abilities of this small molecule. Additionally, DCN-4CQA shows efficient ISC owing to its small ΔEST value, according to DFT calculations. Therefore, these NPs exhibited high photothermal conversion efficiency (η = 47.3%) and excellent 1O2 generation abilities (ΦΔ = 24.3%) under laser irradiation. We also proved that the DCN-4CQA/F127 NPs are more effective in killing cancer cells in vitro than using PDT alone. Additionally, histological examinations demonstrated that there was no obvious toxicity from the DCN-4CQA/F127 NPs toward the main organs of the treated mice. All the data demonstrated that the DCN-4CQA/F127 NPs exhibit ideal tumor destruction performance through PTT/PDT synergetic therapy. This contribution provides a new idea for further developing high-performance organic therapeutic agents.
