    , Accepted 4th April 2011First published on 20th April 2011AbstractWe report a novel method, namely an O (dye)-terminated process, to fabricate stable anatase TiO2 nanosheets with exposed {100} facets for dye sensitized solar cells. Their light to electricity conversion efficiency could be improved to 7.0% in the absence of a scattering layer, owing to the unique 2D structure with low-energy facets, which is superior to the 5.1% of the devices with P-25 TiO2 films.

Broader context

            TiO2 films of photoanodes for dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), serving as the electron acceptor and a transport layer, play a key role in the improvement of the light to electricity conversion efficiency. Although theoretical and experimental studies have demonstrated that O-terminated {100} facets have the lowest surface energy, on which the dye adsorption is similar to the O-terminated process, the desired 2D materials are still not applied to DSSCs because of some restrictions. We report herein a novel method, including O-terminated synthesis – thermal activation – O (dye)-terminated processes, to fabricate and apply stable single-crystal anatase TiO2 nanosheets with exposed {100} facets. As a photoanode material for DSSCs, their light to electricity conversion efficiency could be improved to 7.0% owing to their unique 2D structure with low-energy surfaces, superior to the 5.1% of a device with P-25 TiO2 films. The TiO2 nanosheets with exposed {100} facets could facilely be synthesized on a large scale in a low-temperature and low-cost system, which might open a new avenue to improve the performance of photovoltaic cells.

Much progress has been made in studies on optimizing the performance of dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) in the last two decades.1–6TiO2 films of photoanodes, serving as the electron acceptor and transport layer, play a key role in DSSCs.7–11 Some key factors, such as the morphology, size, surface state, and crystalline structure, affect the electron transport and the amount of dye adsorbed on the TiO2 photoanode.11–15 In order to enhance the light to electricity conversion efficiency (η), much effort has made to focus on the nano-architecture of TiO2 with good crystallinity and high surface area.16–19 Recently, vertically oriented one-dimensional (1D) TiO2 nanostructures, such as nanowires,20nanorods,21–23nanotubes,24–27 and nanofibers,28 have also been reported to remarkably enhance electron transport by creating a direct conduction pathway. However, their application is limited by large-area fabrication and high cost. Although 2D TiO2 frameworks, i.e., nanosheets with highly active exposed {100} or {001} facets, draw great attention, they have been rarely applied in DSSCs due to their thermal instability.29 Therefore, the fabrication of stable anatase TiO2 nanosheets for sintered photoanode films is still a challenge.
It is also interesting to note that theoretical and experimental studies demonstrate that O-terminated {100} facets have the lowest surface energy.30,31 Moreover, the dye adsorption on anatase {100} facets is similar to the O-terminated process. Therefore, we speculate that the {100} facet could bond with carboxyl groups of dyes more firmly than other facets. Very recently, tetragonal faceted anatase nanorods with exposed {100} facets were successfully prepared from Na-titanate, which were obtained in NaOH solution, but the materials are not suitable for DSSCs due to their low surface area, submicro-size and Na-doping.31 Herein, we report a one-pot method to prepare single crystalline anatase TiO2 nanosheets with exposed {100} facets, which were rather stable even after calcination at 500 °C. Film devices with the anatase nanosheets exhibit excellent η (7.03%) under simulated AM 1.5 sunlight irradiation. This result is much better than that of the standard P-25 photoanode (5.12%) under the same conditions.
Single crystalline anatase TiO2 nanosheets were synthesized on a large scale via a hydrothermal method. In a typical experiment, 19 g (∼0.056 mol) of titanium(IV) butoxide was dissolved in 25 g of N,N-dimethylethanolamine (DMEA). After rapidly adding 16 g of distilled water, the suspension was transferred into a Teflon autoclave and heated at 150 °C for 16 h. The obtained white powder was further annealed at 500 °C for 0.5 h to form sample TO-500. More information is provided in the ESI.†
The crystalline structure and stability of the TiO2 nanosheets were examined by powder X-ray diffraction, as shown in Fig. 1. The pattern of the as-synthesized sample coincides with that of TO-500, indicating that the stable anatase phase was formed by a hydrothermal process. It is noteworthy that the intensity of (004) is higher than that of the standard anatase TiO2 phase (JCPDS: 21-1272), which suggests dominant crystal growth along the [001] direction.

          XRD patterns of the as-synthesized sample and TO-500. 
The morphologies of the as-synthesized sample and TO-500 were analyzed by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). TiO2 nanosheets with lengths of 90–120 nm, widths of 20–40 nm and thicknesses of ∼5 nm can be seen from the TEM image (Fig. 2a) of the TO-500 sample. The FESEM image of TO-500 shown in Fig. S1† is in conformity with the TEM image, which also shows a sheet-like framework even after heat treatment at 500 °C. To determine the crystal facets of the anatase TiO2 nanosheets, high-resolution TEM was employed, and its images are provided in Fig. 2b and Fig. S2.† The crystal growth of the TiO2 nanosheets along the [001] direction is shown in Fig. 2b, indicating that stable anatase TiO2 nanosheets could be formed.32 The lattice spaces of the TiO2 nanosheets, with 0.35 nm and 0.24 nm corresponding to the (101) and (004) planes of the anatase phase, were determined when lying flat, as shown in Fig. S2,† which is consistent with the above XRD and TEM analysis.

Nitrogen adsorption–desorption curves and pore distribution of as-synthesized sample and TO-500 were further investigated in Figs S3 and S4.† There are no significant differences in the adsorption–desorption and pore-distribution curves of the samples before and after calcination. The surface areas of the as-synthesized sample and TO-500 are 108 and 90 m2 g−1, respectively, calculated from the N2 adsorption isotherm using the DFT (density functional theory) method. The surface area of TO-500 is much larger than the surface area (55 m2 g−1) of the standard P-25. This indicates that the TiO2 nanosheets can provide a large surface area for the adsorption of dye in dye sensitized solar cells. Moreover, the small pore volume of TO-500 is 0.072 cm3 g−1, which is filled with an extremely small amount of electrolyte. Therefore, the small pore volume can effectively reduce the effect of colored electrolyte.
The stable anatase nanosheet with exposed {100} facets is suitable for DSSCs due to its high crystallinity and large surface area. To investigate the photovoltaic properties of the anatase TiO2 nanosheets, device A was constructed by applying platinum coated ITO glass as counter electrode and the film composed of anatase nanosheets as the photoanode. As our focus is the effect of the anatase nanosheets, the photoanodes were coated with TiO2 nanosheet films deprived from the scattering layer. The transparent ITO glass employed as the photoanode substrate was treated with TiCl4 before TiO2 paste casting. The current density–voltage curves were collected by following the reported method.33Fig. 3a shows the current density–voltage characteristics of device A. A yield of light to electricity conversion efficiency of 7.03% was observed, with a high fill factor of 0.74. In order to gauge the performance of device A, device B, with a photoanode composed of the standard P-25, was fabricated and tested using similar experimental procedures as the reference cell. Its current density–voltage characteristics are shown in Fig. 3b and its power conversion efficiency and fill factor are 5.12% and 0.73, respectively; much lower than the results of device A. The current–voltage curve of a solar cell with an anatase nanoparticle (average size < 25 nm) film is also provided in Fig. S5.† Due to the large amount of adsorbed dye on the anatase film, its light to electricity conversion efficiency is 5.42%, which is only slightly more efficient than the 5.12% of the P-25 film.

The incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE), which is directly affected by the crystal structure and surface properties, is commonly used to estimate the performance of TiO2 photoanode films. Fig. S6† shows a photograph of bare TO-500 and P-25 films and the IPCE values of devices A and B. The TO-500 film has a better transmittance than the P-25 film in Fig. S6a.† Compared with the P-25 film in Fig. S6b,† the IPCE of device A, with the TO-500 film, increases significantly from 375 nm to 750 nm. The results show the device with the TO-500 film is suitable for improving the light to electricity conversion efficiency in the visible light region. Based on the single-crystal structure and the size of TO-500, the electron loss may be reduced in the transfer process owing to the reduction of grain boundaries. On the other hand, TO-500 has a stable 2D structure for internal light scattering, which may enhance the IPCE and hence contribute to the higher light to electricity conversion efficiency.
The amount of adsorbed dye molecules and the amount of dye-desorption at different times were analyzed to further confirm that the {100} facets of TO-500 nanosheets could bond with the carboxyl groups of dyes more firmly than the {101} facets of P-25. The dye-desorption experiments were processed in 5ml of a 0.1 M NaOH water–ethanol (1:1, v/v) mixed solution. Fig. 4a shows the UV-Vis absorption spectra of N719 desorbed from TO-500 and P-25 films after desorption for 8 h. The amount of dye molecules desorbed from the TO-500 film is close to the value obtained from the P-25 film. This suggests that almost the same amount of dye was adsorbed on the TO-500 and P-25 films. It is generally assumed that the larger surface area (90 m2 g−1) of anatase nanosheets, compared to the 55 m2 g−1 of standard P-25, may provide more sites for N719 molecule adsorption. In fact, the amounts of dye adsorbed on the TO-500 and P-25 films are almost equal (3.46 × 10−8 and 3.52 × 10−8 mol respectively). The main reason may be that P-25 has more grain boundaries than the TO-500 nanosheet, on which N719 molecules, with big heads, could be assembled in micelle-like structures. The schemes of dye adsorbed TO-500 and P-25 are provided as the inset of Fig. 4a. The other possible reason is that some TO-500 nanosheets may overlap each other in the fabrication process of the film electrode, which limits the amount of absorbed dye.

Fig. 4b shows that the amount of dye molecules that were desorbed from TO-500 and P-25 films at different times. Due to the many interspaces between the dye layer and the TO-500 interface, the OH−groups could easily diffuse into the single-molecule layer of dye on the TO-500 interface. The amount of dye desorbed from the TO-500 film is more than that from P-25 film in the first hour. Once the micelle-like layer was destroyed, the dye on the P-25 film was more easily replaced with hydroxyl groups than that on TO-500. This result demonstrates that the {100} facets of TO-500 nanosheets could form more stable bonding with N719 molecules than the {101} facets of P-25. To investigate the effect of diffusion paths, the powders of TO-500 and P-25 were employed in the dye-desorption experiments. The results show that the dye-desorption curves of the powders have similar properties to the films, as shown in Fig. S7.† The dye-desorption rates are faster than those of the films, due to the short diffusion paths of the desorbed dyes.
Although both electrodes produce comparable light harvesting, owing to them absorbing almost the same amounts of dye, the efficiency of device A, with the TO-500 film, is about 1.37 times higher than that of device B, with the P-25 film. There are two main reasons for the increased photocurrent density. a) The value of the diffusion coefficient of TO-500 may be higher than that for P-25, owing to the effect of grain boundaries, which minimize electron loss in the transfer process.34 b) The dye-terminated 2D structure, with low surface energy, may slow down the back transfer of electrons to I3− and the oxidized dye.
According to the above analysis, there are three key steps in the work, as shown in Scheme 1a. First, a DMEA and water system is employed to synthesize TiO2 nanosheets based on the unique advantages of this system: 1) it offers OH−groups, which are required to form O-terminated facets (Scheme 1b); 2) the boiling point of the system is very close to the reaction temperature, which makes it a safe synthetic protocol, superior to the solvents with lower boiling points. In the activated process, the {100} facets can be easily activated by heating and no doped ions exist in the stable TiO2 bulk after annealing at 500 °C (Scheme 1b). More importantly, the dye adsorption on anatase {100} facets is in fact the O-terminated process. The chemical bonds between the dye and the facets are very stable due to the low surface energy. In this case, the unique facets may minimize the chances of electron trapping from surface defects and hence improve the efficiency of the light to electricity conversion. Therefore, the nanosheet-like anatase TiO2, with exposed low-energy O-terminated facets, is a desired photoanode material for DSSCs.

In conclusion, single-crystal TiO2 nanosheets were first synthesized on a large scale with exposed {100} facets in a one-pot method. The facile and ideal (O-terminated – activated – O (dye)-terminated) processes make the material more compelling for use in DSSCs. The power conversion efficiency of the device with the TiO2 nanosheet film could be up to 7.03%, superior to the 5.12% of the device with the P-25 film photoanode. We think that our reported method could give fresh impetus to the fabrication of TiO2 electrode materials for DSSCs.
