    , Accepted 4th March 2019First published on 5th March 2019AbstractTwo-dimensional (2D) materials have drawn considerable attention for their applications in ultrafast laser pulse generation, owing to their unique optical nonlinearities. However, most of these 2D materials have an indirect bandgap (e.g. MoS2, WS2) or zero bandgap (e.g. graphene). In this study, we report the nonlinear optical properties of a direct bandgap monoclinic structure, gallium tellurium quantum dots (GaTe QDs), and its application as a novel saturable absorber for mode locking laser generation. The fabricated GaTe QDs have an average size of 2.68 nm. This report is the first demonstration showing the generation of ultrafast laser using the 2D GaTe based saturable absorber. This newly developed saturable absorber combines both the advantages of direct bandgap 2D materials and the quantum dot structure. By incorporating the GaTe QD saturable absorber into both Er-doped and Yb-doped fiber lasers, ultrashort pulses with very stable operation at the central wavelengths of 1530.90 and 1030.72 nm are produced, respectively. The measured saturable intensity of the GaTe absorber is 3.1 GW cm−2 using a 200 fs, 11.8 MHz, 1560 nm pulsed laser source. Additionally, ultrafast laser pulses with a duration of about 115 fs are generated by inserting the GaTe saturable absorber into an Er-doped fiber laser. The experimental results open a new avenue for the use of direct bandgap GaTe QDs in lasers and photonics applications.
Introduction
Two-dimensional (2D) layered materials, including graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), are exploited for broad electronic or optoelectronic device applications for their favorable optical and electronic properties.1–6 In particular, some of the 2D materials have enormous popularity in the nonlinear optical field, which is driven by their attractive optical properties compared with traditional optical materials such as GaAs and InP,7e.g. broadband absorption, ultrafast carrier dynamics, ultrashort recovery time and high modulation depth. Therefore, these materials offer a wide range of potential optical applications including optical limiting, saturable absorption,8 optical communication etc.9 Actually, the group 6 TMDs, most notably MoS2, MoSe2, WS2 and WSe2, have been used for pulsed laser generation previously.10 These 2D materials show exceptional optoelectronic properties,11,12 saturable absorption10,13 and optical limiting14,15 properties. Currently, some other TMD family members with narrow bandgaps, such as ReS216 and SnS2,17 have also been used as saturable absorbers for mode locking laser pulse generation. These reports illustrate the potential of inorganic semiconducting 2D nanosheets in the fields of nonlinear optics and ultrafast lasers.18,19 However, these 2D semiconducting materials generally have indirect bandgaps with a lower quantum transition possibility compared with direct bandgap 2D materials.20 Some of the 2D materials, e.g. MoS2 and WS2, develop direct bandgaps in monolayer form, but it is very difficult and expensive to fabricate them as monolayers. In fact, 2D materials with multiple layers already exhibit favorable optical properties compared with their bulk form14 and they can be mass produced easily by some simple and low-cost methods, e.g. ultrasonic exfoliation.21,22
Layer-independent direct-bandgap 2D materials have attracted great interest from the research community for their high-efficiency quantum transition possibility, strong light absorption and low fabrication cost.20,23 The most investigated 2D material with a direct bandgap independent of the layer number is black phosphorus, which has a broadband nonlinear optical response, ultrafast carrier dynamics,24 high carrier mobility and high switching ratio. The nonlinear optical property of phosphorene has been investigated systematically. It exhibits a broadband nonlinear optical response ranging from 400 to 1930 nm24 and produces mode locking pulses at 1085 nm,25 1550 nm,26 1898 nm,27 and 2970 nm.28 However, its instability in air limits its practical applications. Therefore, it is very important to explore other direct bandgap 2D materials with high stability. GaTe is a III–VI group layered metal chalcogenide. Each GaTe layer consists of Te–Ga–Ga–Te units along the c-axis. It has two important crystal structures, monoclinic and hexagonal. The bandgap energy is crystal-structure dependent. As for monoclinic GaTe, it is a direct-gap semiconductor from bulk to monolayer,29 which shows excellent carrier mobility properties and long carrier lifetimes. Therefore, it has a wide range of optoelectronic applications, such as solar cells.30 Due to its monoclinic structure, GaTe nanosheets exhibit a direct bandgap property and stronger photon absorption compared with other indirect bandgap III–VI GaSe and GaS compounds.
Recently, the dependence of the non-linear optical properties of two-dimensional materials on their size and layer thickness has been demonstrated. Our previous study shows that the quantum dot exhibits stronger nonlinear optical absorption properties compared with its nanosheet form.14 Due to quantum confinement and size effects, two-dimensional material based quantum dots offer strong nonlinear optical absorption and new opportunities for applications in the laser photonic fields. Various applications of QDs have been demonstrated including electroluminescent optical switches, solar cells, biological imaging etc.31,32 Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) have broadband absorption and ultrafast carrier dynamics that are favorable features for ultrashort pulse generation.33 Graphene and black phosphor QDs exhibit great nonlinear optical properties, which is different from their few-layer nanosheet form.34–37 Therefore, there is much interest to investigate the optical properties and fabrication methods of the GaTe 2D material based quantum dots.38,39 This paper presents the synthesis procedures of the GaTe QD via a low-cost liquid exfoliation method. The ultrafast mode-locking laser performance of two Er and Yb-doped laser systems is quantified using the fabricated GaTe QD based saturable absorber. So far, it is the first demonstration of mode-locking laser pulses using a GaTe QD based saturable absorber, which possesses the advantages of both the direct bandgap 2D materials and quantum dot features.
Experimental
Preparation of GaTe quantum dots
GaTe powder was bought from Aladdin. 0.05 g of GaTe was dissolved in 50 ml of NMP solution, then vigorous stirring was applied for 8 h at 29 °C with added ice, and the formed black suspension was centrifuged at 10000 rpm and kept in bottles. The cuvette was shook for 1 minute after laser illumination every 10 minutes to keep the uniformity of the suspension.
Characterization
The characterization of bulk GaTe was performed on an X-ray Diffractometer (XRD, Bruker D8 Advance); TEM images of the GaTe QDs were recorded on a JEOL Model JEM-2011 transmission electron microscope and the accelerating voltage was 200 kV. The AFM images were taken with a Dimension (Veeco Nanoscope V) in tap mode. The UV-vis absorption spectra (200–900 nm) were measured using a scanning spectrophotometer (Shimadzu) at room temperature. The Raman measurement was undertaken on a HR800 Raman microscopy system (Horiba Jobin Yvon), using a 488 nm laser with an air-cooling charged coupled detector.

Fig. 1a and b display the schematic atomic structure of monoclinic GaTe; the layered structure consists of alternate Te–Ga–Ga–Te atoms within the planes and covalent bonding and van der Waals forces hold the layers together.29 1/3 of the Ga–Ga bonds are parallel to the planes and the other 2/3 are perpendicular to them, which is different from other III–VI layered materials, as for GaSe and GaS in which all Ga–Ga bonds are perpendicular to the planes. This leads to different crystallographic and optical properties to those of other III–VI group 2D materials, e.g. GaS and GaSe that have indirect semiconducting properties. Fig. 1c shows the XRD pattern of GaTe. The diffraction peaks (2θ) located at 12°, 24°, 42°, 45° and 72° correspond to the planes of (210), (420), (640), (541), and (123), respectively, corresponding to the monoclinic phase (JCPDS file no. 71-0620)40 with the B2/m(12) space-group symmetry.

Fig. 2a illustrates the TEM image of the GaTe QDs. The obtained GaTe QDs are quite small with a uniform size of several nanometers. Fig. 2a inset shows the HRTEM image of a single GaTe QD, and the in-plane lattice spacing is 0.25 nm, which corresponds to the (131) planes of monoclinic gallium tellurium. The lattice fringes of the GaTe QDs can be clearly observed. Fig. 2b shows the AFM image of GaTe QDs on the substrate. Two GaTe QDs were selected randomly and labeled as 1 and 2 and their topography images are presented in Fig. 2b. The height profiles of those two marked quantum dots are inserted in Fig. 2b, with the precise thickness given. Their diameter distributions are mainly within the range of 2.0 to 3.2 nm, and the average diameter is 2.68 nm, as shown in Fig. 2c, illustrating that the prepared GaTe QDs are ultrasmall with excellent uniformity. This demonstrated that the GaTe powder can be effectively ultrasonicated into quantum dots uniformly dispersed within the NMP solution by the simple liquid exfoliation method. The statistical information of nanosheet thickness was obtained from 100 QDs in the AFM images. The thickness distribution of the GaTe QDs is shown in Fig. 2d. The average thickness of those GaTe QDs is about 4.5 nm, corresponding to a few (∼5) layers of GaTe QDs.20 The absorption spectrum of the GaTe QDs suspension in the NMP solution is given in Fig. 2e. Two characteristic absorption peaks at 266 and 400 nm can be observed in the UV-visible absorption spectrum.

The Raman spectrum of the fabricated GaTe QDs is shown in Fig. 2f. It shows four peaks positioned at 72 cm−1, 104 cm−1, 148 cm−1 and 258 cm−1. The peak at 148 cm−1 is due to ambient oxidization, which can be detected clearly from the exfoliated GaTe QD. The Raman characteristic peaks in Fig. 2f show that our prepared GaTe QD has a monoclinic structure, because for a hexagonal GaTe structure, we should observe five Raman active mode peaks and three of them should be greater than 180 cm−1.29
Ultrafast photonics applications
In order to quantify the saturable absorption characteristics of the GaTe QD-SA, the dependence of the transmittance on the pump peak power optical density of the incident laser was characterized by balanced twin detector measurement technology, as displayed in Fig. 3a. The measurement system consists of a home-made nonlinear polarization rotation mode-locked EDFL fiber laser, which provides 1560 nm pulse laser with a repetition rate of 11.8 MHz, a pulse duration of 200 fs, a 50:50 optical coupler and power meters. As depicted in Fig. 3b, the measured data clearly show that the transmittance increases with the pump peak power density, implying saturable absorption effects. The fitting line shown in Fig. 3b was generated using eqn (1). α(I) = αs/(1 + I + Is) + αns(1)where α(I) is the absorption coefficient; αs and αns are the saturable and nonsaturable absorption components, respectively; I and Is are the input and saturation intensities, respectively. The saturation intensity and modulation depth are given as 3.1 GW cm−2 and 1.27%, respectively. The modulation depth of the tested GaTe sample is comparable to other carbon-based materials, e.g. SWNTs41 and graphene.42 The result indicates that the GaTe QD-SA could be used to generate mode-locked laser pulses efficiently.

Mode-locking fiber lasers were constructed by using the GaTe QD based saturable absorber. The experimental setup is given in Fig. 4, in which a 10 mm interaction length side-polished fiber with the deposited GaTe QDs was used as the saturable absorber. The distance from the fiber core surface to the flat surface of the D-shaped area is about 1 μm. The GaTe QD solution is dropped onto the polished side of the D-shaped fiber to form a SA. The GaTe QD-SA was inserted in between the PC and 10% output coupler (OC). The Yb-doped fiber laser (YDFL) uses a 1 m Yb-doped fiber (250 dB m−1 @ 980 nm) and the single mode fiber (HI 1060, Corning) to form a ring cavity with the total cavity length of 17.5 m. For the Er-doped fiber lasers (EDFLs), a 4 m Er-doped fiber (4.45 dB m−1 @ 980 nm) and a single mode fiber (HI 1060, Corning) are used to construct a ring cavity with a total cavity length of 23.3 m. The output of the mode-locked laser was characterized by an optical spectrum analyzer (Yokogawa, AQ6370D), radio-frequency spectrometer (Rigol, DSA800), an oscilloscope (Tektronix, DPO 4104B) connected with a fast 4 GHz InGaAs photodetector (Thorlabs, DFT08CFC/M), an optical power meter (Thorlabs, PM20CH) and an optical autocorrelator (APE, PulseCheck). The output characteristics of the laser source without the GaTe QD-SA were checked. It was found that no mode-locked pulses could be observed when adjusting the polarization state of the PC or the pumping power from 0 to 650 mW. So, there is no self-started mode-locking effect obtained from all the fiber laser systems used for these experiments.

Characterization of the ultrafast Er-doped fiber laser
After slight adjustment of the intracavity polarization state, the mode-locking operation of the EDFL with the GaTe QD-SA was successfully achieved when the pump power scales beyond the mode-locking laser threshold of 144 mW. The laser output characteristics are presented in Fig. 5. Fig. 5a indicates that the optical spectrum reveals a central wavelength of 1530.9 nm with a 3 dB spectral bandwidth of 18.1 nm. Fig. 5b presents the autocorrelation curve of the Er-doped mode-locked fiber laser with a full width half maximum (FWHM) of 115 fs, which is very short compared with other mode- locking results reported using other 2D absorber materials, e.g. MoS2, graphene, PbS QDs,43 NbSe2 QDs44 and black phosphor QDs.45 However, the laser pulse duration can be further reduced by using the hybrid mode-locked scheme.46Fig. 5c displays the long-term stability of the output spectra measured at 1.5 hour intervals over 9 hours. The mode-locked output power as a function of the pump power is shown in Fig. 5d. As the pump power increases from 144 to 345 mW, the corresponding average output power increases linearly from 1.78 to 3.84 mW, resulting in a slope efficiency of approximately 1.01%.

The pulse trains of the generated mode-locked laser pulses in a different time scale are given in Fig. 6a and b. Both figures show stable mode-locking pulses. Fig. 6c shows the repetition rate of the mode-locking laser pulses of 8.79 MHz, corresponding to the total cavity length of 23.3 m. Meanwhile, a high signal to noise ratio (SNR) of 43 dB is observed. The corresponding wideband (0–180 MHz) radio frequency spectrum is shown in Fig. 6d, proving a very stable operation regime of the laser pulses. The maximum pulse energy obtained from the Er-doped fiber laser is 0.436 nJ.

Characterization of the ultrafast Yb-doped fiber laser
The YDFL started to generate stable mode-locking pulses at the pump power of 260 mW after the cavity polarization was carefully adjusted by the PC. Fig. 7a shows the output optical spectrum of the mode-locked laser pulses centered at 1030.72 nm. Fig. 7b depicts the single pulse envelope, which was measured by a high-speed oscilloscope (Tektronix, DPO 4104B) with a bandwidth of 1 GHz. The full width at half maximum of the Gaussian function fitting shows the single pulse duration of 752 ps corresponding to a time-bandwidth product of 15.594, which indicates that the output pulses are not completely chirped. For the sech2-shaped pulses, the minimum time-bandwidth product is around0.32 that implies that the pulse duration can be further reduced. In fact, a piece of photonic crystal fiber can be used to compensate the dispersion of the laser pulses for further pulse duration reduction.47 The stability of the mode-locking laser pulses can be inspected by monitoring the optical spectra of the laser over time. The spectra of the laser were recorded every 20 minutes over 2 hours under the same experimental conditions, as displayed in Fig. 7c. The results show that the spectral bandwidth, spectral strength and central spectral peak location remained stable over 120 minutes, showing the high stability of the mode locking achieved. The output power as a function of the pump power is given in Fig. 7d. When the pump power increased from 260 to 340 mW, the corresponding average output power increases from 6.0 to 9.0 mW linearly, and the power conversion efficiency is around 3.78%. The slope efficiencies of the fiber lasers are mainly determined by the efficiency of the gain medium and the optical loss within the laser cavity. In general, the Stokes limit of the Yb-doped fiber is higher than that of the Er-doped fiber, leading to a higher slope efficiency.

The mode-locking laser pulse trains of the YDFL mode-locked laser in different time scales are shown in Fig. 8a and b. Both figures show high stable mode-locking pulses. Fig. 8a shows that the pulse to pulse duration is 85.2 ns, corresponding to the repetition rate of 11.73 MHz, which agrees well with the total cavity length of 17.5 m. The corresponding maximum pulse energy obtained from the Yb-doped fiber laser is 0.781 nJ. The RF spectrum of the Yb-doped mode-locked fiber laser is shown in Fig. 8c. The RF spectrum located at the fundamental repetition rate of 11.73 MHz, and the SNR is approximately 50 dB, which matches with the predicted fundamental frequency of the ring laser cavity. Fig. 8d shows the RF spectrum measured at 200 MHz of the fiber laser we built, which indicates that the fiber laser has good stability. Those results were compared with the performance of other quantum dots. Table S1 (ESI†) displays the properties of fiber lasers using different saturable absorbers; in contrast with other QD saturable absorbers, our GaTe QD saturable absorber offers some favorable mode-locking laser features and the shortest laser pulse duration is obtained by using the GaTe absorber. The overall performance of our results shown in Table S1 is very good when compared with other QD materials. That implies that this new material offers great potential for nonlinear optics and ultrafast laser photonics devices. Additionally, the exciton dynamics of the GaTe quantum dots was investigated, and the lifetime was measured using an 800 nm (100 fs) excitation laser source. Fig. S1 (ESI†) shows that the photon decay of the GaTe quantum dots is exponential. The decay curve clearly exhibits multi-exponential decay and can be well-fitted using the double exponential decay function: A1e−t/τ1 + A2e−t/τ2, where τ1 < τ2; τi denotes the fluorescence lifetime of each component in the GaTe quantum dot solution; each factor Ai is the corresponding weight of the ith component. The fitting decay time constants are τ1 = 1.312 ns (87.08% of weight) and τ2 = 10.893 ns (12.92% of weight). Thus, the corresponding mean decay time of the GaTe quantum dots is 2.55 ns. No damage on the saturable absorber during the operation for both laser systems could be observed. Potentially, the D-shaped fiber offers a long interaction length between the laser and the absorber material that could lead to a high damage threshold.48

Conclusions
In this study, direct bandgap ultrasmall GaTe quantum dots with a diameter of 2.68 nm are fabricated by a simple and cost-effective liquid ultrasonic exfoliation method. The nonlinear optical property of the prepared GaTe QDs is investigated and mode-locking ultrafast laser generation is also demonstrated using the fabricated materials. The fabricated GaTe saturable absorber can be used for two mode-locking laser systems (Er-doped fiber laser operating at 1530.9 nm and Yb-doped fiber laser operating at 1030.72 nm). The mode-locking Er-doped fiber laser produces laser pulses with a duration as short as 115 fs and the pulse repetition rate is 8.79 MHz. The mode-locking Yb-doped fiber laser produces laser pulses with a duration as short as 752 ps and the pulse repetition rate is 11.73 MHz. This first demonstration confirmed that GaTe QDs can potentially be used over a broad wavelength range and they are a promising nanomaterial for ultrafast photonics.
