    , Accepted 15th May 2020First published on 15th May 2020AbstractA surface-modification layer is important for the performance and stability of perovskite solar cells, but the research on surface-modification materials is still lagging behind perovskite materials in the photovoltaic field. In this work, a linear conjugated tetramer, IDTT4PDI, was developed through Stille coupling with a high synthetic yield. IDTT4PDI showed excellent solubility, thermal stability, a suitable LUMO level (−4.08 eV), and high electron mobility, implying that it would be suitable for use as a surface-modification layer in inverted perovskite solar cells. The use of IDTT4PDI as a surface-modification layer improved the interfacial contact between the perovskite layer and PCBM film, reduced the trap-assisted recombination, and enhanced the electron transport efficiency. As a result, an efficiency of over 20% is achieved by an IDTT4PDI-modified MAPbI3 perovskite inverted device, which is much higher than that of the control device (17%). This work opens up a new direction for the use of linear perylene diimide derivatives as efficient surface-modification materials for achieving high-efficiency perovskite solar cells.
1. Introduction
Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite materials have received much attention due to their outstanding optical and electronic properties.1–3 Since the development of perovskite composites, device structures, processing techniques, charge transport materials, and surface-modification materials, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have exceeded 24% in the past decade.4–6 Charge transport materials can improve the directional transport of holes or electrons in PSCs, which is the key to enhancing the device performance. Common charge transport materials are divided into inorganic (metal oxides) and organic materials, the latter of which have broader selectivity and chemical modification methods.7–9 Therefore, the development of organic charge transport materials can promote the development of PSCs with desirable performances.
PCBM is a fullerene derivative with a long exciton lifetime and high electron mobility and has recently been used as an electron transport material to achieve efficient electron extraction and transport in PSCs.10–12 However, the three-dimensional molecular skeleton of PCBM results in large steric hindrance and weak π–π stacking, which makes it difficult to obtain suitable film morphologies. Therefore, it is difficult to form ideal interfacial contact between the perovskite layer and PCBM film which limits the improvement of device performance. Additionally, PCBM incompletely covers the surface of the perovskite layer, which leads to abnormal interfacial contact between the perovskite layer and metal electrodes. Moreover, the hydrophilic ester group of PCBM increases the infiltration of moisture into the perovskite film, which accelerates the degradation of perovskite and decreases the stability of solar cells.13,14 In order to solve these problems, there are currently two strategies for interfacial engineering to achieve efficient PSCs. On the one hand, self-assembly of fullerene derivatives is used to improve interfacial contact to enhance the device performance, but fullerene derivatives have no functional groups or intermolecular interactions to facilitate self-assembly.15–17 Furthermore, fullerenes are expensive and difficult to modify, making their synthesis and commercialization difficult.18,19 On the other hand, employment of an excellent surface-modification material optimizes the interfacial contact between the perovskite layer and PCBM film, which passivates surface defects and suppresses trap-assisted recombination.20–22 However, commercial surface-modification materials have only demonstrated surface passivation without electron-transport properties, which limits further improvements in device performance.23–25 Therefore, our intensive investigations have focused on low-cost surface-modification materials with surface passivation and electron transport properties.
In our previous work, we developed a donor–acceptor type perylene diimide (PDI) tetramer with a thiophene unit as a high-efficiency electron acceptor for organic solar cells.26 This PDI tetramer exhibited a suitable LUMO level and high electron mobility, demonstrating that it could be used as an excellent surface-modification layer for achieving high-efficiency PSCs. Herein, we designed and synthesized a linear and homologous PDI tetramer containing an indacenodithiophene unit (IDTT4PDI) as a multifunctional surface-modification layer for inverted PSCs. The use of IDTT4PDI/PCBM as an enhanced electron transport layer improved device performance and stability compared with the control device without the IDTT4PDI-modified layer. As expected, the introduction of IDTT4PDI increased the PCE from 17.4% to 20.1% due to excellent electron transport and reduced trap-assisted recombination. This work shows that IDTT4PDI is an efficient surface-modification material and has potential for application in the photovoltaic field.
2. Results and discussion

IDTT4PDI was synthesized by Stille coupling in high yield. Its structure and synthetic route are shown in Fig. 1a and Scheme S1,† respectively. Then, the structure of IDTT4PDI was characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and HRMS as depicted in Fig. S1–S3.†IDTT4PDI exhibited excellent solubility in common organic solvents, such as THF (>15 mg mL−1), chloroform (>20 mg mL−1), and chlorobenzene (>20 mg mL−1), which allowed the formation of uniform thin films.27 The UV-vis absorption spectrum of IDTT4PDI in dichloromethane showed two maxima at 434 and 530 nm, and an optical gap of 1.61 eV as shown in Fig. 1b. It has been demonstrated that IDTT4PDI has about a 2 nm red-shift from solution to the thin film, implying the presence of weak intermolecular aggregation, presumably due to the linear conjugated framework. Cyclic voltammogram showed three pairs of reversible reduction peaks and no oxidation peaks as shown in Fig. 1d. The onset reduction potential is at −1.00 V for IDTT4PDI and the half-wave potential of the onset reduction peak was used to calculate the LUMO level. The LUMO level was estimated to be −4.08 eV, suggesting that it closely matched the LUMO level of MAPbI3 perovskite (−3.90 eV) and PCBM (−4.00 eV), which can reduce the energy level barriers and facilitate efficient electron transport in solar cells.28,29

To gain further insight into the electron density distributions and energy levels of IDTT4PDI, density functional calculations were conducted by employing the Gaussian 09 program as shown in Fig. 1c. The LUMO levels are mainly located on the perylene diimide units, and the HOMO levels are mainly located on the IDTT unit. The calculated LUMO and HOMO levels of IDTT4PDI are −3.66 and −5.17 eV, agreeing well with the CV data. The suitable energy levels of IDTT4PDI can be beneficial for achieving efficient perovskite solar cells. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) confirmed a high decomposition temperature of 411 °C for IDTT4PDI as shown in Fig. S4,† demonstrating its excellent thermal stability. According to the space charge limited current (SCLC) method (Fig. S5†), the device with an architecture of ITO/ZnO/IDTT4PDI/Ca/Al had a relatively high electron mobility (1.12 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1), indicating that IDTT4PDI can be used as an electron transport material in the photovoltaic field. As a result, IDTT4PDI exhibited excellent solubility, suitable energy levels, good thermal stability, and high electron mobility, which show that IDTT4PDI has great potential as a multifunctional surface-modification material for inverted PSCs.
Excellent surface coverage and low roughness of the IDTT4PDI film as a surface-modification layer play important roles in achieving high-efficiency PSCs. The film morphology of bare, PCBM-coated, and IDTT4PDI-coated perovskite films was investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM) as shown in Fig. S6.† The root mean square (RMS) roughness of a perovskite/IDTT4PDI film was 11.9 nm, which is smoother than the bare perovskite (18.4 nm) and perovskite/PCBM (14.2 nm) films. An excellent surface-covered perovskite film was obtained when modified with IDTT4PDI, which minimized trap-assisted recombination between the perovskite layer and PCBM film. Then, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images showed a homogeneous pinhole-free perovskite layer when modified with IDTT4PDI, which is comparable to the perovskite/PCBM film as shown in Fig. 2a and b. The IDTT4PDI-modified perovskite film had a larger water contact angle than the PCBM-coated film (Fig. 2d and e), showing that IDTT4PDI was more hydrophobic than PCBM, which could help to reduce moisture-induced degradation of the perovskite film and be beneficial for improving the device stability.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed to explore the intermolecular interactions between the perovskite layer and IDTT4PDI film. Interestingly, Fig. 2c indicates that the Pb (4f) peaks of the IDTT4PDI-modified perovskite film slightly shifted to lower binding energies compared with those for the bare film.30 This interaction could exist at the perovskite and IDTT4PDI interface. Meanwhile, photoluminescence (PL) spectra were recorded (Fig. 2f) to verify this phenomenon. The IDTT4PDI-modified film showed a remarkably lower PL intensity than bare and chlorobenzene-washed perovskite films, which agrees well with the XPS measurements and also proves the existence of this intermolecular interaction. The interaction is attributed to the weak coordination between the carbonyl groups of IDTT4PDI and the mismatched lead atoms on the perovskite surface, thereby passivating the surface defects together with improving interfacial contact.31–33 Based on the above discussion, IDTT4PDI exhibits efficient passivation along with decreasing the surface defects of perovskite, which demonstrates that it appears to be a promising material for surface modification of high-efficiency inverted PSCs.
Based on the above properties of IDTT4PDI, it was next used as a multifunctional surface-modification layer for inverted PSCs. The photovoltaic performance of inverted PSCs with or without the IDTT4PDI layer was characterized using the device architecture ITO/PTAA:F4-TCNQ/PMMA/MAPbI3/IDTT4PDI/PCBM/Bpen/Al, as shown in Fig. 3a. Herein, the thickness of the IDTT4PDI interlayer is varied from 0 to 28 nm to determine the influence of surface modification on PSCs as shown in Fig. S7† and the results are summarized in Table S1.† As the film thickness of IDTT4PDI changed, the PCE of the IDTT4PDI-modified device remained over 18.7%, suggesting that the thickness of the surface-modification layer was not influential in the device performance, making it more advantageous for practical photovoltaic applications. Then, forward and reverse scan J–V curves were obtained to demonstrate the effect of the IDTT4PDI-modified layer on the hysteresis of the device performance. Fig. 3b shows that the IDTT4PDI-modified device has a better performance along with a negligible hysteresis effect compared with the control device without the IDTT4PDI layer, and the related results are summarized in Table 1. This indicates that the surface-modification layer decreased surface charge recombination and improved the interfacial contact at the perovskite/PCBM interface. Therefore, the PCE values increased from the 17.4% for the control device to 20.1% for the device with the IDTT4PDI layer, clearly demonstrating that the MAPbI3 device performance was obviously improved by employing IDTT4PDI as an efficient surface-modification layer. It is obvious that the PCE (20.1%) in this work is one of the highest values for MAPbI3 inverted PSCs with surface modification.34–38

To investigate the reason for the enhanced photovoltaic performance of the IDTT4PDI-modified devices, electron-only devices were constructed (Fig. S8†) to further explore the trap density and electron mobility in the IDTT4PDI-modified and control devices using the SCLC method. A lower trap density (1.75 × 1015 cm−3) and higher electron mobility (0.028 cm2 V−1 s−1) were obtained for the IDTT4PDI-modifed device than for the control device (2.29 × 1015 cm−3 and 0.018 cm2 V−1 s−1). These results demonstrate that the surface defects of perovskite films were efficiently passivated when modified with IDTT4PDI, presumably due to the intermolecular interactions. In addition, the increased electron transport performance of the modified devices was attributed to the introduction of the multifunctional IDTT4PDI layer.
Insight into the recombination mechanism can be obtained by measuring the Vocversus light intensity for control and IDTT4PDI-based PSCs.28 The measured Voc and light intensity (I) are correlated using eqn (1), where k is the Boltzman constant, T is the temperature in Kelvin, and q is the electric charge. This indicates that the slope of Vocversus light intensity (I) from unity kT q−1 is closely related to trap-assisted recombination in PSCs. As a result, Fig. S9† shows a slope of 1.48 and 1.33 kT q−1 for the control and IDTT4PDI-based PSCs, respectively. This suggests that the addition of the IDTT4PDI layer could suppress trap-assisted recombination and energy loss, thus improving the Voc and PCE for the PSCs, which is in agreement with J–V measurement results. The energy level alignments of inverted perovskite solar cells and the working mechanism of IDTT4PDI as an interface engineering layer are shown in Fig. S10.† (1)
Furthermore, steady-state and time-resolved PL spectra (TRPL) of IDTT4PDI-modified and control films were obtained (Fig. 2f and 3f) to gain a deeper insight into the influence of the IDTT4PDI-modified layer on the PSCs. When the perovskite film was coated with a PCBM layer, the PL intensity decreased due to the efficient charge transfer at the perovskite/PCBM interface. At the same time, when both IDTT4PDI and PCBM were used, the PL intensity was markedly quenched. Due to efficient surface passivation of the IDTT4PDI layer, trap-assisted recombination on the perovskite surface could be suppressed in comparison with control devices. When the surface defects were reduced, more efficient electron extraction and transport could occur at the interface between the IDTT4PDI layer and perovskite film. As a result, the IDTT4PDI-based film exhibited a lower PL intensity than the control film. Next, the decay lifetimes of the control and IDTT4PDI-modified perovskite films were measured by TRPL. The IDTT4PDI-modified film exhibited reduced decay lifetimes compared with the control film, which was attributed to the improved electron extraction and suppressed trap-assisted recombination. Furthermore, fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) images of the two films are presented in Fig. S11,† which show that both two films have dense grains and pinhole-free morphologies, in agreement with the AFM and SEM images. The SCLC, PL, TRPL, and FLIM results show that the use of IDTT4PDI as a surface-modification material improves the device performance.
External quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the two PSCs were obtained to demonstrate the functionality of the IDTT4PDI-modified layer (Fig. 3c). The IDTT4PDI-modified device had a strong photocurrent response within 300–800 nm. There was also a superior response compared with the control device, suggesting that the efficient surface modification was responsible for the improved photocurrent of the PSCs. Moreover, the integrated current density of IDTT4PDI-modified PSCs was 22.4 mA cm−2, which was superior to that of the control device (21.2 mA cm−2) owing to the efficient charge extraction and the interfacial contact of the modified PSC. As expected, the EQE results were consistent with the J–V measurements. The steady photocurrent and device efficiency of the two PSCs were measured (Fig. 3d), and the results indicated a higher maximum power point of the IDTT4PDI-modified PSC than that of the control device. The IDTT4PDI-modified devices showed a relatively superior steady current density of 23.4 mA cm−2 at 0.88 V, along with a steady efficiency of 19.1%, which closely agreed with the J–V results. Next, the PCE histograms of 40 devices showed that the repeatability and reliability of modified devices were improved by the IDTT4PDI-modified layer. Fig. 3e shows that the PCEs of the control devices and modified devices were (16.9 ± 0.4)% and (19.4 ± 0.4)%, respectively, implying that IDTT4PDI can be an efficient surface-modification material for the PSCs. In addition, the stability of the two PSCs was measured under an ambient atmosphere (about 25% relative humidity) without encapsulation as shown in Fig. S12.† The PCE values reached nearly 60% of the optimal value for the modified devices in over 150 hours of storage, while for the control devices they dramatically decayed to 40% of their initial values during the same time. The IDTT4PDI-modified perovskite film with high-quality coverage efficiently prevented the degradation of perovskite by moisture, and also improved the stability of the PSCs, as shown by AFM and SEM measurements.
3. Conclusions
In summary, a linear conjugated perylene diimide tetramer containing an indacenodithiophene unit, IDTT4PDI, was synthesized in high yield. IDTT4PDI exhibited excellent solubility in common organic solvents, weak intermolecular aggregation in thin films, a suitable LUMO energy level, good thermal stability, and high electron mobility. These suggest that IDTT4PDI can potentially be used as a high-efficiency and multifunctional surface-modification material in PSCs. Therefore, IDTT4PDI was employed as a surface-modification layer at the perovskite/PCBM interface to fabricate inverted perovskite solar cells. A higher PCE value of 20.1% was obtained in the IDTT4PDI-modified MAPbI3 devices compared with that of the control devices (17.4%) without the IDTT4PDI-modified layer. Efficient surface passivation and high coverage at the perovskite/PCBM interface help to improve the device performance and stability due to the excellent interfacial contact, enhanced electron transport, and decreased trap-assisted recombination by using IDTT4PDI as a surface-modification material. It is worth noting that the ambient stability of IDTT4PDI-modified devices was also higher than that of the control devices due to the presence of the hydrophobic IDTT4PDI layer which helps to prevent the degradation of the perovskite film by moisture. This work demonstrates that perylene diimide derivatives are promising for use as excellent surface-modification materials in inverted PSCs.
