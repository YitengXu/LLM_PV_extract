    , Accepted 3rd January 2017First published on 3rd January 2017AbstractAn amorphous Cu–In–S nanoparticle-based precursor ink with improved atom economy was developed in which a large amount of bulky organic ligands was replaced with metal salt–organic ligand complexes. This change resulted in a reduction of the required amount of organic ligands in the ink, meaning that additional spaces in the green layer were occupied by constituent metal atoms rather than organic ligands. Using modified amorphous Cu–In–S nanoparticle inks containing metal salt–organic ligand complexes, improvement of the morphologies of selenized CuInSe2 thin films was observed in terms of greater compactness, better flatness, and larger grains, which led to an increase in the device efficiency to 10.85%. This result demonstrates that even with low-quality precursor materials, such as amorphous Cu–In–S nanoparticles, proper control of the atom economy of the precursor inks enables the facile fabrication of high-quality inorganic semiconductor films and devices at low cost.
I. Introduction
Cu-based chalcogenide, i.e. Cu(In,Ga)(S,Se)2 and Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4, solar cells are promising among all thin-film photovoltaic technologies because of their high efficiency for the former1,2 and earth abundance for the latter3,4 as well as their stable performance for both terrestrial and space applications. Thus far, the highest efficiencies were achieved for Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGSe)-type solar cells based on high-vacuum processes such as multi-stage co-evaporation and reactive annealing of sputtered metal precursors, yielding efficiencies of 22.6%1 and 22.3%,2 respectively. However, the high manufacturing costs of vacuum-based deposition limit the large-scale commercialization of these devices. In contrast, non-vacuum solution-based thin film fabrication is believed to be a simple and cost-effective alternative option that offers efficient material utilization and high throughput.5–7
The solution-based approaches can generally be divided into two categories depending on the types of precursor materials: nanoparticle-based and direct solution coating routes.8,9 The advantages of the former approach (particularly when using chalcogenide nanoparticles as precursors) over the latter include the fact that the precursor particles themselves act as a building block for the final films, with all of the required elements contained within the individual nanoparticles. This process ensures that no additional reduction and/or etching steps are required during production, and more importantly, superior composition uniformity of the final films can be achieved.10,11 Moreover, the composition of the chalcogenide nanoparticle precursors was reported to be directly transferred to both the as-coated and selenized films without a noticeable change in their atomic ratios.5,12 Due to the above-mentioned advantages, a 15%-efficient Cu(In,Ga)(S,Se)2 (CIGSSe) solar cell was demonstrated by McLeod et al. using Cu(In,Ga)S2 (CIGS) nanoparticle precursors,13 the efficiency of which is among the highest values reported in the literature for solution-based CIGSe-type solar cells.
However, a frequently mentioned drawback of the nanoparticle-based route is the required pre-fabrication and purification steps of the nanoparticles, which can be omitted in the direct solution-coating processes. This subprocess means that the entire film fabrication process via the nanoparticle-based routes is rather complicated compared with that via direct solution coating.8,14 Fabrication is more problematic when the hot injection method is used to synthesize the precursor nanoparticles, which typically require high reaction temperatures, long reaction times (> several hours) and complicated thermal treatment histories.11 Although the hot injection method has been successful for preparing high-quality nanoparticles with high crystallinity and/or mono-dispersity, from an industrial point of view, it is not an attractive technique due to complicated processing steps and potentially high costs. Thus, an alternative preparation technique for the precursor nanoparticles that is easier and simpler in nature is needed to make the nanoparticle-based route more competitive and cost-effective.
However, it should be stressed that the alternative method has significance only if it can produce high-quality thin films and devices with efficiencies comparable to those obtained via the existing technologies, including hot-injection-based processes.
It has generally been agreed that the greatest challenge of the nanoparticle-based route is the question of how to obtain a highly dense absorber layer without voids and pinholes because sintering of the CIGSe-type nanocrystals is inherently difficult due to the high melting temperature of the CIGSe phase. It was proven that even with monodispersed and highly crystalline CIGSe nanocrystals, the device built using such nanoparticles without proper sintering showed only limited photovoltaic response.15 This result clearly demonstrates the importance of the densification of nanoparticle-derived films to eliminate recombination centers presumably located at the surface of the nanoparticles.
Several efforts have been devoted to improving the density and compactness of the nanoparticle-derived CIGSe films: (1) the intentional use of the CuSe phase16,17 or excess liquid Se18 to induce liquid flux-assisted sintering and densification during selenization, (2) the lattice expansion that occurs when S in the sulfide precursor particles (rather than selenide) is replaced by Se during selenization10,13,19 and (3) the formation of chelate complexes at the particle surfaces with organic chelating agents to enhance the viscous flow of the amorphous nanoparticles during selenization.11,20 It is notable that all of the above approaches are intended to enhance the thermally activated atomic movement or rearrangement during high temperature selenization after the precursor film preparation is completed. In other words, the effectiveness of the above strategies depends significantly on how densely the constituent atoms are packed in the precursor film. If the initial packing density is poor, then little opportunity exists for the above strategies to effectively work during the selenization. Certainly, a more fundamental approach to achieving the highest density of the final film might be increasing the “atom economy” at the initial ink preparation stage, which is defined as the ratio of the number of deposited atoms to the total number of atoms in the precursors.21 One typical example is the elimination of bulky organic sacrificial groups in the precursor ink because thermal decomposition of these groups causes substantial volume contraction and discontinuity in the deposited film, presumably resulting in a final heat-treated film with poor quality. To this end, replacement of the bulky organic ligands with the metal chalcogenide complexes (MCC), as proposed by Talapin's group21,22 is a breakthrough in significantly improving the atom economy. Thereby, the inorganic ligands consist of constitutive metal atoms in the final film, and they act as a composition-matched “glue”. The space originally occupied by the bulky organic ligands is occupied by the MCC, which consists of the atoms required to construct the final film via the ligand exchange process. Although the authors of ref. 21 and 22 did not directly mention the “densification” of the final film, this improved atom economy is certainly beneficial to increasing the density, compactness and degree of sintering of the post-annealed film. However, from an industrial point of view, this ligand exchange process is not attractive because it requires a controlled environment (glove box) and a long exchange duration of over several hours. Thus, the development of a method by which it is possible to improve the atom economy in a more facile manner is a prerequisite for maximizing the actual cost-effectiveness of the nanoparticle-based routes.
In this work, we report a route to forming high-quality CuInSe2 (CISe) thin films that uses a hybrid precursor ink consisting of “amorphous Cu–In–S nanoparticles” with “metal salt–organic ligands complexes” to satisfy both criteria at the same time, i.e. increasing “atom economy of the process” and ensuring “industrial compatibility or facileness of the process”. Herein, the amorphous nanoparticles are reportedly simple to prepare because the precursor nanoparticles are synthesized using a notably short reaction time (1 min) without any external heating.11,20 In particular, we intentionally replace a significant portion of the bulky organic ligands with metal salt–organic ligand complexes. This modification of the ink recipe facilitates a reduction in the total amount of organic ligands required to obtain suitable coatability, which drives the improvement of the atom economy in the process. It should also be emphasized that the strategy of increasing the atom economy reported in this work is not based on complicated ligand exchange but on simple mixing of the precursor nanoparticles with the metal salt–organic ligand complexes, thus ensuring the ease of the entire deposition process. The fact that ink fabrication and deposition can be performed in an ambient environment is also a great advantage of this route. Despite the simple nature of this process, the increased atom economy greatly improved the quality of the final CISe thin films in terms of grain size and compactness. The devices built with these films demonstrated an efficiency of up to 10.85%. This promising result implies that even with precursor nanoparticles of low quality (e.g., the mixture of amorphous nanoparticles used in this work), proper control of the atom economy in such a simple manner can lead to the fabrication of high-quality device-grade inorganic semiconductor films.
II. Results and discussion
Two different routes with different atom economies
The following two routes were compared to investigate the effects of the atom economy of the nanoparticle-based processes on the characteristics of the CuInSe2 thin films and solar cells.

Route 1: Cu–In–S nanoparticle + MEA (monoethanolamine)

Route 2: Cu–In–S nanoparticle + metal salt–MEA complexes
Cartoons showing the simplified chemical structures of the precursor materials in each ink formulation are presented in Fig. 1. A common feature of the two routes is that the identical amorphous Cu–In–S nanoparticles (Fig. S1†) synthesized via a low-temperature colloidal process were used as basic building blocks for film formation. However, although the organic ligands (MEA in this work) are directly chelated to the surface metal ions of the nanoparticles in Route 1,11,20 they are chelated to those of metal salts (and not to the nanoparticles) in Route 2. For the latter case, the metal salt–MEA complexes are able to fill the empty spaces between the nanoparticles. Due to the increased solid amounts and effective collisions between the neighboring solids, it is expected that the viscosity of the ink prepared via Route 2 is higher than that prepared via Route 1 when the same amounts of organic ligands are added. In other words, to achieve the same degree of ink viscosity, we might reduce the required amount of organic ligands in Route 2, which could potentially increase the atom economy of the process.
 Fig. 1  Expected chemical structures of the precursor materials in the inks prepared via (a) Route 1 and (b) Route 2. 
The atom economies of the two processes are further estimated in a more quantitative manner using the ratio of the amount of organic ligands to the amount of metals (OMR, organic-to-metal ratio) in the inks. In this work, the amount of organic ligands corresponds to the minimum required amount for suitable coatability, which is experimentally determined. In our case, OMR is defined as the ratio of the amount of MEA (in mol) to the total amount of metal atoms (in mol) (metal atoms include Cu and In from both the nanoparticles and the metal salts). The detailed calculation sequence is presented in Table S2.† The calculated OMR value of Route 2 is approximately one half that of Route 1, clearly demonstrating the improved atom economy of Route 2, as expected. In this calculation, the effects of the anion components in the metal salt–MEA complexes (acetate in our case) on the atom economy (OMR value) were not considered primarily because they are minor in quantity compared with MEA and secondly because the anion components will be replaced by Se atoms during the post-selenization treatment, which is not likely to leave significant empty space. In other words, the anion components in metal salts will not cause substantial volume contraction and/or discontinuity of the deposited and heat-treated film. Another point to be verified in the calculation is the experimentally determined minimum required amount of organic ligands, which actually determines the final OMR value. In particular, it is important to confirm whether the amount of MEA in Route 1 is indeed the minimum required amount. This issue is addressed by investigating the effects of reducing the amount of MEA in Route 1 on the morphology of the resultant film, and the results are shown in Fig. S3.† When we reduced the amount of MEA in Route 1 from 1.2 g (0.01965 mol) to 0.96 g (0.01572 mol) (a 20% reduction), the film morphology was significantly degraded in terms of the formation of cracks and voids even if the grain size was increased. This poor morphological property is consistent with a previous report of abnormal grain growth of the amorphous nanoparticles without organic ligands.23 Thus, the amount of MEA used in the calculation in Table S2† can reasonably be considered as a minimum required value.
Based on this simple estimation and comparison of the atom economy of the two routes, we investigated the effects of the different degrees of atom economy on the film and device characteristics.
Characteristics of CISe thin films from different routes

Fig. 2 shows the SEM images of the air-dried precursor films prepared via two different routes. No noticeable difference is observed in the morphology of the films, demonstrating that the amount of MEA is properly determined to form dense and crack-free precursor films for both cases.
 Fig. 2  SEM images of the air-dried precursor films prepared using (a) Route 1 ink and (b) Route 2 ink. 
The distinct impacts of different routes were observed in the selenized films, as shown in Fig. 3. In general, both films have double-layered structures in which a crystalline CISe layer is placed on a carbon-containing residue layer (CRL). The thicknesses of the top CISe layers (approximately 600 nm) and that of the bottom-CRL (approximately 1 μm) were similar for both films. This double-layered structure has commonly been reported for CI(G)Se-type films processed from hydrazine-free, organic-ligand containing solution routes.6–11,16 However, the quality of the top layers was significantly different for the two films, as shown in the planar SEM images (middle and bottom images in Fig. 3(a) and (b)). The CISe layer prepared using the Route 2 ink was flatter and had larger grains that were well connected with each other and had fewer voids than that prepared using the Route 1 ink. This result clearly indicates that the improved atom economy of the process results in CISe films with better morphological properties.
 Fig. 3  SEM images of the selenized films prepared using (a) Route 1 ink and (b) Route 2 ink. (Top: cross-sectional view, middle: planar view and bottom: magnified planar view.) 
The XRD patterns of the films show that both films consist of chalcopyrite CISe without any binary selenide (Fig. 4(a)). Notably, the films have a minor peak at 27.76° corresponding to CuInS2 (CIS). The origin of this peak is the unreacted Cu–In–S phase remaining in the bottom CRL.11 The reduced intensity of the CIS peak in the Route 2 film implies that conversion of the sulfide precursor to selenide was easier in Route 2 than in Route 1. This effect was further revealed by the AES depth profiles of the films shown in Fig. 4(b) and (c). First, the reduced carbon content in the CRL of the Route 2 film was observed, as expected. In parallel, the S content in the CRL of the Route 2 film was also much smaller than that in the Route 1 film, consistent with the XRD result, whereas Se showed an opposite trend. This result suggests that carbon in the precursor film, which originates primarily from MEA and practically dominates the atom economy of the process, might determine the degree of sulfide-to-selenide conversion reaction as well as the incorporation of Se into the film. The enhanced selenide-formation reaction in conjunction with the better morphological properties of the final film is thought to be the most prominent benefit of the improved atom economy of our nanoparticle-based process at the stage of film analysis. We subsequently compared the performance of the devices built with these films.

Device performance
CISe devices were fabricated by depositing the CdS/ZnO/Al layers (without anti-reflection coating) on the two CISe films. The Route 1 devices demonstrated efficiencies of 6.74 ± 0.78% with a maximum of 7.75%, and the Route 2 devices showed efficiencies of 9.86 ± 0.78% with a maximum of 10.85% (the average and standard deviation were calculated using the data obtained from ten devices for each route). Fig. 5(a) shows the light-illuminated I–V curves of the best-performing devices. It was found that with the Route 2 ink, all of the device parameters (VOC, JSC and FF) were improved compared with those of the Route 1 ink. The relative increases in each parameter included a 15.0% increase in VOC, a 5.4% increase in JSC and a 15.5% increase in FF. Thus, the major improvement in efficiency came from the increase in VOC and FF, and the JSC increase was secondary. To obtain additional insight into the reason for the improvement, the fundamental diode parameters and parasitic resistance values of the devices were extracted by fitting their dark I–V curves to the following I–V equations. The equations include both the ohmic and non-ohmic components for consideration of the shunt paths according to the SCLC (space-charge limited current) model.7,24 Individual equations for each current pathway can be expressed as follows:    Jnon-ohmic shunt = KVmwhere J0 = reverse saturation current density, q = charge of an electron, V = applied bias, k = Boltzmann constant, T = absolute temperature, A = diode ideality factor, RSH = ohmic shunt resistance, K = coefficient of the SCLC component (related to the length and conductivity of the current path) and m = power factor of SCLC. Combining these equations with a series resistance (RS) gives a full expression for the dark I–V as follows:25  
 Fig. 5  (a) Light-illuminated curves and (b) EQE curves of the best-performing devices prepared via different routes. 
The parameters extracted from the dark I–V curves of the two best-performing devices using the above equations are presented in Table 1. The Route 2 device showed a significant reduction of J0 and improvement of the shunt-related parameters (increase in RSH and decrease of K and m) compared with the Route 1 device whereas two devices had similar A and RS values, which can reasonably explain the improvement in VOC and FF of the Route 2 devices. From a material-based point of view, shunts in CI(G)Se solar cells can originate from various sources, such as inappropriate absorber film properties; morphological defects (pinhole or void), inclusion of conductive secondary phases and defective grain boundaries, and imperfect deposition/coverage of the buffer layer on the absorber film.7 Among these, the most probable explanation for the reduced shunts in the Route 2 device is the improved morphological properties of the top CISe layer. Fig. 3 reveals that the film prepared using the Route 2 ink was flatter and had larger grains with fewer voids than that prepared using the Route 1 ink. In particular, reduced numbers of pinholes and voids in the Route 2 film are expected to cause the mitigation of shunt currents in the device. In line with the reduction in shunts, the morphological improvement of the Route 2 film should result in the elimination of structural defects which may act as recombination centers, which is consistent with the previous report stating that the improved morphology and increased grain size of nanoparticle-based CIGSSe films resulted in a reduction in the trap assisted non-radiative recombination.10 Thus, the improved morphologies of the film prepared via Route 2 (larger grain and higher film density, Fig. 3) are the presumable reasons for the mitigation of recombination (reduction of J0) and the decrease of leakage current (reduction of shunt current).

Next, to elucidate the increase in the JSC for the Route 2 device (a secondary factor for the efficiency increase), the external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of the devices were measured and compared, as shown in Fig. 5(b). It was found that the EQE of the Route 2 device at long wavelengths is higher than that of the Route 1 device, and the EQE at short wavelengths are similar for both devices. Typical explanations for the different EQE values at long wavelengths are a different degree of light absorption and/or a different diffusion length of the minority carrier. In our case, due to the similar thickness of the top CISe layers (Fig. 3), the two films are expected to have a similar degree of absorption, which enables the exclusion of the former reason even though a slightly higher absorption in the film of the Route 2 device due to the higher density cannot be completely excluded. Thus, we attributed the improved EQE at long wavelengths (and hence the JSC) of the Route 2 device to the improved collection probability of the minority carriers, which likely stemmed from the improved absorber film quality of the Route 2 device.
Atom economy, carbon content and quality of the CISe film
In this work, the atom economy of the amorphous nanoparticle-based route was controlled by changing the amount of bulky organic ligands added to the initial precursor inks. Conceptually, a higher atom economy was achieved by filling the space originally occupied by organic ligands with constituent metal atoms from the molecular solution. Experimental observations from this improved atom economy (with reduced carbon content in the ink and film) include CISe films with a higher density and larger grains, and solar cells with a higher efficiency due to reduced recombination and leakage currents. This section is devoted to discussing the physical reasons for this improvement.
As a first step, it is helpful to review the general film formation mechanisms in the solution-based routes and the role of the carbon content in these mechanisms. Recent studies reportedly mentioned that the top chalcogenide absorber layer prepared from hydrazine-free organic-ligand-containing routes forms via a reaction between the metal-ions, which vigorously diffused from the bottom portion of the film to the top surface, and the Se (S) vapor.6,7,26,27 At the same time, carbon (which is not involved in the top layer formation) accumulates toward the bottom layer to finally form the CRL. Researchers have gradually concurred that the CRL itself is a merely a conductor that acts as a second backing electrode on the Mo thin film to form good ohmic contacts with both the upper absorber film and the underlying Mo layers.6,28 These electrically benign properties of the CRL contrast with the old belief that the CRL is the cause of the high series resistance. Instead, the actual role of carbon in the precursor film lies in affecting the diffusion behavior of the metal ions, and hence it determines the degree of participation of the metal ions in the formation reaction of the top layers.6 For the particular case of ref. 6, carbon from MEA that is chelated to Cu ions hindered the diffusion of Cu and affected the composition and morphology of the top CISe layers. Thus, the carbon content in the precursor inks is believed to determine the kinetics of the top-layer formation reaction and hence the properties of the layer, i.e. morphology, composition and ultimately electro-optical characteristics.
Based on this understanding, the different characteristics of the CISe films and the devices fabricated from the two different routes are discussed in this section. For a better description, the schematics of the film formation reactions via the two routes are presented in Fig. 6.
 Fig. 6  Schematics of the process flow from precursors to the final selenized films focusing on the different degrees of metal diffusion to the top surface for the case of (a) Route 1 and (b) Route 2. The thickness and length of the grey arrows represent the relative magnitude of the diffusion flux. 

Route 1: The content of metal atoms in this precursor film is less than that of the Route 2 precursor film, as previously described, and most of the surface metal ions are chelated with MEA. In addition, these metal ions should diffuse through the highly carbon-containing matrix, acting as a diffusion barrier,6 to the top surface to form CISe grains. Thus, a relatively small diffusion flux of metal ions during selenization is expected (the small diffusion flux is marked with small grey arrows). This limited supply of metal ions to the top surface results in CISe films with small grains and lower density, as evidenced in Fig. 3(a). The high S and low Se contents in the bottom layer, as shown in the AES depth profile of this film (Fig. 4(b)), additionally suggest that the highly carbon-containing matrix mitigates not only the diffusion of metal ions but also that of chalcogen atoms during selenization.

Route 2: A higher content of metal atoms is expected in this precursor film than in the Route 1 film, primarily because the voids between the nanoparticles are intentionally filled with the metal salt–MEA complexes. The improved atom economy of this route was quantitatively estimated in terms of its OMR value which was approximately one half that of Route 1 (Table S2†), reflecting that the carbon content in the deposited film in Route 2 is approximately one half that in Route 1. Furthermore, the significantly reduced numbers of chelated metal ions as well as the low carbon content of the film matrix in Route 2 enable facile diffusion of metal atoms to the top surface. Due to the sufficient supply of metal atoms originated from the improved atom economy of the Route 2 recipe, the formation of highly dense CISe films with large grains was possible, as shown in Fig. 3(b). Again, the reduced S content and high Se content in the bottom layer of this film (Fig. 4(c)) support the facile diffusion of chalcogen atoms and metal ions during the selenization process.
All of the experimental results verified that control of the atom economy in the precursor ink has a great impact on the properties of the solution-processed inorganic compound thin films and the efficiency of the devices built with these films. In particular, we address this issue in a simple manner, by mixing the precursor nanoparticles with metal salt–organic ligand complexes. The atom economy in this case was improved due to filling of the spaces between the nanoparticles (which was originally occupied by organic ligands) with constituent metal ions. This simple modification of the ink recipe resulted in a significant increase in the efficiencies of the CISe devices of up to 10.85% from 7.75%.
The quality of our (Ga-free) CISe film was further evaluated by comparison with that of other solution-processed CISe films that demonstrated high conversion efficiencies when processed into final devices (Table 2). The highest efficiency obtained from solution-processed CISe devices is 13% with an anti-reflection (AR) coating, as recently reported by A. R. Uhl et al.,14 which broke the previous record of 12% reported by W. Liu et al.29 However, these processes suffer from technological drawbacks such as the required use of a glove box in the ink preparation, film formation and annealing (for the former process) and the use of highly toxic and explosive hydrazine (for the latter process). If we limit our view to more environmentally-friendly routes that can be processed in air, the record efficiency drops to approximately 9%.6,18 From these comparison, it is clear that the highest efficiency obtained in this work (10.85% without an AR coating) is notably higher than that of the previous air-processed routes (9%) and even challenges that of the inert-gas-required and/or hydrazine-based processes (12–13%) (We note that these values were obtained with the AR coating). Based on these investigations, we suggest that control of the atom economy of the nanoparticle-based routes in a simple manner, as exemplified in this work, offers a highly efficient and facile strategy for achieving high densification of the solution-processed light absorber films and ultimately a high device efficiency, even if low quality, amorphous-like nanoparticle precursors are used.

Molecular solution
A molecular solution was prepared by dissolving Cu(II) acetate monohydrate (2.5 mmol) and In(III) acetate (2.5 mmol) into 13 ml of 2-methoxyethanol with 2 ml of MEA followed by mechanical stirring for 1 h, resulting in a deep-blue-colored solution. This solution preparation was performed in ambient air.
Preparation of precursor inks
The final inks were prepared via two different routes. All of the ink preparation steps were performed in ambient air.

Route 1: Amorphous Cu–In–S nanoparticles (1.2 g) were dispersed in 2-methoxyethanol (4.3 ml) with addition of MEA (1.2 ml). This ink was stirred using a magnetic stir bar for 30 min before spin coating.

Route 2: Cu–In–S nanoparticles were mixed with the above-mentioned molecular solution. In the concrete, the nanoparticles (1.2 g) were mixed with 5 ml of the molecular solution. In this case, the amounts of the 2-methoxyethanol and MEA in this final ink were approximately 4.3 ml and 0.66 ml, respectively. This ink was also mechanically stirred for 30 min before use.
Film deposition and selenization
The precursor inks were spin-coated onto Mo (1 μm)-coated soda-lime glass (SLG) substrates and heated in air on a hot plate at 270 °C for 5 min to evaporate the solvents and partially decompose the precursor. This process was repeated several times until the required thickness of the precursor film was achieved. The precursor film was subsequently selenized in a Se-rich environment using a heat-treatment chamber inside which a graphite container was placed. The chamber was equipped with a temperature and pressure controller. The precursor samples were placed inside the graphite container together with 0.2 g of Se pellets, and the container was covered with a graphite lid. After loading of the samples in this manner, the chamber was initially evacuated to a base pressure of 10−6 Torr using a turbo-molecular pump, and the background pressure was regulated by injection of nitrogen gas to 40 Torr. Selenization was performed at 550 °C for 30 min. In this case, the actual partial pressure of Se vapor inside the graphite container during selenization was calculated as approximately 54 Torr according to ref. 7.
Device fabrication
Solar cells were fabricated according to the conventional Mo/CISe/CdS/i-ZnO/n-ZnO/Al structure. A CdS buffer layer with 50 nm thickness was deposited onto the CISe films via chemical bath deposition (CBD), and i-ZnO (50 nm)/Al-doped n-ZnO (500 nm) was deposited onto the CdS layer using radio-frequency (rf) magnetron sputtering. An Al grid of 500 nm thickness was deposited as a current collector using thermal evaporation. The active area of the completed cell was defined as 0.44 cm2.
Characterization
The morphology and composition of the selenized films were investigated using high-resolution scanning electron microscopy (HRSEM, XL30SFEG Phillips Co., Holland at 10 kV) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS, EDAX Genesis apex, acceleration voltage: 30 kV, collection time: 100 s with a standard-less method), respectively. Structural information for the films was obtained by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a CuKα radiation source (λ = 1.5406 Å). The depth compositional profile of the selenized films was obtained via Auger electron spectroscopy (AES, PerkinElmer, SAM 4300) without a standard. For this reason, the depth profile data were considered only semi-quantitatively. The dark and light illuminated J–V characteristics of devices were obtained using a Keithley I–V measurement 236 source meter and a class AAA solar simulator (WXS-155S-L2, WACOM, Japan) under AM 1.5G 1 sun standard conditions, respectively. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) of devices was measured using an incident photon conversion efficiency measurement unit (PV Measurements, Inc., USA). All device characterization methods were performed in a special measurement laboratory in which a primary reference solar cell calibration technique was established.30
IV. Conclusions
We reported the use of an amorphous Cu–In–S nanoparticle-based solution process to form CISe light absorber films with large grains and high film density. In particular, we intentionally mixed the precursor nanoparticles with metal salt–organic ligand complexes in which the metals are constituent elements of Cu and In to improve the atom economy of the process. This modified route produced suitable coatability of the precursor inks for spin coating with a reduced amount of the required organic ligands compared with the pure nanoparticle-based inks. The reduced carbon content in the precursor film in turn facilitated the ease of diffusion of metal ions to the top surface and incorporation of Se into the film. Due to the enhanced participation of metal ions to the CISe film formation reaction, it was possible to obtain highly dense CISe films with micron-sized large grains. The device efficiency was also greatly improved to 10.85% (the modified route) from 7.75% (pure nanoparticle-based route), primarily due to the reduced saturation current density and the increase in the shunt resistance. These results clearly demonstrate that control of the atom economy in the nanoparticle-based processes is an effective densification strategy for the formation of inorganic light absorber films. We showed that even low-quality, amorphous-like precursor materials could successfully be processed to fabricate a high-efficiency device. In addition, the simple nature of our process is described by the following: (1) the use of amorphous precursor nanoparticles prepared in a short reaction time and without an external supply of heat, (2) the ease of preparation of the ink achieved simply by mixing the nanoparticles with an alcohol-based molecular solution, (3) no need for a glove box in the ink preparation, film coating and drying steps and (4) one-step selenization with Se vapor without a complicated multi-step thermal history. These advantages suggest that our process is promising for the production of high-efficiency devices at greatly reduced processing costs.
