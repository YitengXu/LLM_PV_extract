The effects of the Pr dopant on the local electronic structure and resulting transport properties are compared to common Nb doping. We demonstrate a substantial enhancement of the thermoelectric figure of merit and develop an explanation for the positive effects, which opens new ways for materials optimization by substitutional doping at the perovskite B site.
I. Introduction
The influence of impurities on the physical and transport properties of thermoelectric materials has long been recognized to be of key importance. Impurities can strongly alter the electronic structure and thus the electrical and thermal conductivities of a system, which determine the thermoelectric performance. Efficient thermoelectric materials are characterized by a high thermoelectric figure of merit, Z = S2σ/κ, where S, σ, and κ = κe + κl are the Seebeck coefficient, electrical conductivity, and thermal conductivity (with electronic and lattice contributions), respectively. The numerator S2σ is commonly known as the power factor and covers the main part of the carrier dynamics. Impurities can be used to control the different interdependent quantities to optimize the power factor and thus the figure of merit, which however is very challenging.
Many of the proposed materials with enhanced thermoelectric response, such as complex chalcogenides,1 skutterudites,2 clathrates,3 and half-Heusler alloys4 suffer from poor chemical and physical stability at high temperature and in an oxidizing environment, along with a substantial toxicity. The thermal stability, excellent oxidation resistance, and often low toxicity of oxides5 make these compounds compatible with major energy conversion technologies, e.g., combustion engines and concentrated solar radiation sources.6,7 Due to its large band gap of 3.2 eV, the maximum power factor and figure of merit in SrTiO3 (ref. 8 and 9) are found at large carrier concentrations of about 1021 cm−3, which are difficult to achieve in the bulk, but are accessible in films. The requirement of a large carrier concentration strongly limits the possibilities of doping to develop efficient thermoelectric materials. Apart from being one of the most widely used chemically and compositionally stable perovskite oxides, the lattice mismatch of SrTiO3 with many other perovskite oxides is small,10–12 such that a wide range of heterostructures can be formed. In addition, it is possible to dope SrTiO3 with either electrons or holes in a controlled manner, allowing the improvement of the thermoelectric efficiency by atom substitution as well as O deficiency and excess.13–17
It has been recently demonstrated that the cationic substitution of Pr for Sr is feasible and has significant influence on the structure and dielectric properties of SrTiO3.18 Moreover, Pr substitution is known to enhance the thermoelectric performance of polycrystalline Ca3−xPrxCo4O9.19 While today the most efficient way to optimize the thermoelectric figure of merit of SrTiO3 is V and Nb co-doping,20 the co-doping approach is rather complex and thus less appropriate from a practical point of view. In the present work we demonstrate that a comparable enhancement of the thermoelectric figure of merit can be achieved by a technologically simpler methodology, A site doping with Pr instead of B site co-doping, a strategy that has not received much attention so far.
II. Computational details
First-principles calculations in the framework of the density functional theory are carried out using the full-potential linearized augmented plane wave plus local orbitals method as implemented in the Wien2k code.21 A Pr doping of x = 8.3% in Sr1−xPrxTiO3, where the optimal concentration reported experimentally is x ≤ 10%,22 is realized by the supercell approach.23 We employ a 2 × 2 × 3 supercell of the primitive cubic SrTiO3 unit cell (space group no. 221, Pmm) with a total of 60 atoms, where one Sr atom is substituted by Pr. We employ the experimental lattice constant of SrTiO3 (3.905 Å) for the whole supercell. The Brillouin zone is sampled using a Monkhorst–Pack 6 × 6 × 4 k-mesh and the exchange-correlation potential is treated in the generalized gradient approximation. For the wave function expansion inside the atomic spheres we set max = 12 and define the plane-wave cutoff via RmtKmax = 6 with Gmax = 24. The radii of the muffin-tin spheres (in Bohr) are set to 2.5 for Sr and Pr, 1.9 for Ti, and 1.7 for O. The valence states comprise the Sr 4s, 5s, 4p, Pr 4f, 5d, 6s, Ti 4s, 3p, 3d, and O 2s, 2p orbitals, while all other states are treated as semi-core and core states. All these calculational parameters have been checked carefully for convergence.
An onsite electron–electron interaction of 4.8 eV is imposed to the Pr 4f states24 and the spin–orbit coupling is taken into account. To capture the effects of structural changes due to the doping on the local chemical bonding and magnetic properties, the atomic forces in the supercell are relaxed down to less than 4 mRy/Bohr. The thermoelectric properties are calculated by the BoltzTraP code,25 which is interfaced with Wien2k. This code is based on the Boltzmann theory and addresses band structure dependent quantities, such as the electrical and thermal conductivities, within the rigid band approach. For calculating the anisotropic temperature-dependent transport coefficients, we use a very fine k-mesh with a total of 2052 points. For Nb-doped SrTiO3 this approach yields results in good agreement with the experiment.26 To account for the temperature dependence of σ, κe, and κl, we assume in our metallic systems for the carrier mobility μ ∝ T−1, yielding σ = neμ ∝ neT−1. Here n is the carrier density from BoltzTraP and we assume that σ is the same as in SrTiO3 at T = 300 K. We then deduce κe from the Wiedemann–Franz relationship and assume κl ∝ T−1, where the constant of proportionality is obtained from experimental data at 300 K.
III. Results and discussion
Sr1−xPrxTiO3 crystallizes in a cubic structure27 with a local lattice distortion around the Pr dopant atoms. Pr has a smaller ionic radius than Sr, which results in a 1.2% shorter Pr–O bond length as compared to the respective Sr–O bond length. This deviation from the ideal structure results in a charge transfer from Pr to Ti, the effect of which is discussed later. The effects of Pr doping on the density of states (DOS) are demonstrated in Fig. 1 and 2. The total DOS of Sr0.917Pr0.083TiO3 in Fig. 1 shows that Pr doping induces metallicity in the system by shifting the Fermi energy (EF) towards the conduction bands. The metallicity is maintained under inclusion of an onsite interaction on the Pr 4f orbitals as well as under consideration of the spin–orbit coupling. Comparison of the electronic structures obtained without onsite interaction and for a value of 4.8 eV indicates that the DOS shape remains essentially the same while all bands shift to lower energy. However, we note that the sharp spin up DOS peak at EF vanishes under inclusion of the spin–orbit coupling, which thus is essential for describing Sr0.917Pr0.083TiO3 accurately. Pr-doped SrTiO3 is another case in that f-element doping does not produce pronounced peaks in the DOS, which would boost the Seebeck coefficient when the doping level is tuned.28

 Fig. 2  DOS of Sr0.917Pr0.083TiO3, compared to the case of Nb doping of the same concentration. 
The calculated total magnetic moment of the supercell is 1.98μB, originating mainly from the Pr 3d and 4f states, see Fig. 2, which appear above 1 eV and below −4 eV. All states near EF are mainly due to the Ti 3d orbitals and are virtually spin degenerate. The charge transfer from Pr to Ti drives the system into a n-doped metallic state, see Fig. 2(a), with similar contributions of the inequivalent atoms irrespective of their distance from the Pr dopant. The top of the valence band is due to the O 2p states. By comparing in Fig. 2(a) the total DOS of Pr-doped SrTiO3 with that of Nb-doped SrTiO3 (with the same dopant concentration, however at different sites, since Nb substitutes Ti and not Sr) we note: (i) in both cases that EF is very close to the edge of the conduction bands. (ii) The DOS around EF is slightly steeper for Nb doping. (iii) The carrier density is enhanced for Pr doping. The spin-polarized Pr 3d and 4f DOSs in Fig. 2(b) show essentially no contribution in the vicinity of EF, though Pr carries a magnetic moment of 1.96μB. While Sr states likewise do not appear around EF, the 3d bands of both inequivalent Ti atoms cross EF, see Fig. 2(c), thereby introducing metallicity. Minor O contributions (with a finite but subordinate spin-polarization) accompany the Ti states due to hybridization, see Fig. 2(d). Interestingly, the spin-polarization of the system is due to states located far from EF, whereas all states near EF are virtually spin degenerate. As a consequence, the transport and thermoelectric properties are identical for the spin up and down channels.
The influence of the onsite interaction and the spin–orbit coupling on the thermoelectric response of Sr0.917Pr0.083TiO3 is addressed in Fig. 3. We note: (i) the magnitudes of the Seebeck coefficient and the resulting figure of merit are reduced by the spin–orbit coupling, compare the blue and red curves, because the sharp spin up DOS peak at EF leads to a higher carrier density, thereby enhancing the Seebeck coefficient. (ii) The onsite interaction localizes the charge carriers around EF and leads to a more negative Seebeck coefficient. This in turn promotes the figure of merit, compare the red and black curves.

The effect of Pr doping on the thermoelectric properties is elaborated in Fig. 4 in the temperature range 200 K to 900 K. Assuming that the relaxation time τ is direction independent, we find that the Seebeck coefficient decreases monotonically with temperature, which results from the decrease of the chemical potential and consequent increase of the Fermi integral with growing temperature.29 The electrical conductivity (Fig. 4(b)) becomes essentially proportional to the temperature above 300 K. The electronic part of the thermal conductivity, as depicted in Fig. 4(c), increases monotonically with the temperature and the resulting figure of merit reaches a maximum of about 0.25 × 10−3 K−1 in a broad temperature range. We stress again that all the discussed quantities are spin independent.

Comparison to the case of Nb doping shows that, while we have a more negative Seebeck coefficient for Pr doping, σ increases and κe decreases prominently. This suggests a much improved performance by Pr doping at the Sr site as compared to Nb doping at the Ti site, for identical dopant concentrations, see the bottom right panel of Fig. 4. The main factor responsible for this difference is the reduced steepness of the DOS at EF in the case of Pr doping, see Fig. 2. Mott's formula implies  and, since σ ∝ n (n is the charge carrier density), a slightly larger  for Nb-doped SrTiO3 near EF, which makes S less negative. By the strong dependence of the figure of merit on the magnitude of S, the figure of merit is enhanced for Pr-doped SrTiO3. Our results show that ZT at 800 K for Sr0.917Pr0.083TiO3 is 0.21, which is very close to the experimental result for a Pr concentration of 10% at approximately the same temperature.22 The large figure of merit is comparable to the best bulk thermoelectrics obtained by substitutional doping of oxides. While we can expect the theoretical results to qualitatively reproduce the experimental behaviour, differences may affect the comparison between Pr and Nb doping due to different lattice contributions to the thermal conductivity and electron–phonon coupling for doping at the Sr and Ti sites. In general, the charge transfer from Pr to Ti plays a central role for the thermoelectric response and the Pr ions offer a sensitive charge source for tuning the transport properties.
