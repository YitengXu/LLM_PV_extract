    , Accepted 11th September 2019First published on 11th September 2019AbstractAll inorganic perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted tremendous attention because of their intrinsic structural stability, but they suffer from uncompetitive efficiency, especially the carbon electrode-based PSCs (C-PSCs), wherein the insufficient perovskite/carbon contact and interfacial recombination are of particular concern. To address these problems, we designed and fabricated a polyethyleneimine-functionalized carbon nanotube (PEI/CNT) interlayer and used it as a bifunctional bridge in all inorganic CsPbI3 based C-PSCs. This functionalized PEI/CNT bridge connects the perovskite layer and the carbon electrode to improve the quality of the perovskite/carbon interface and also works as an interfacial passivation layer due to the coordination ability of the anchored PEI molecules on CNTs. Systematic investigations revealed that the interfacial charge transfer resistance was reduced, and surface trap states in the perovskite film were passivated. This effort led to a remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 10.55% with a high fill factor (FF) of 0.71 for the all inorganic C-PSCs. By contrast, those without the PEI/CNT bridge only attained a PCE of 7.41% and FF of 0.56. Moreover, non-encapsulated PEI/CNT based devices also showed higher stability under high humidity or high temperature conditions. Therefore, the PEI/CNT interface bridging strategy has the potential to achieve high efficiency and high stability for the all inorganic C-PSCs.
1. Introduction
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) based on organometal halide perovskites as light absorbers have experienced rapid development in the past decade, with the certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) now reaching 25.2%, already comparable to that of the commercial silicon solar cells.1–5 Although PSCs have achieved high performance, their stability is quite problematic.6–8 On the one hand, due to the compositional and structural instability of perovskite materials under high temperature or high humidity the organic cations can easily escape from the lattice.6 On the other hand, the utilization of expensive and operationally unstable organic hole transport materials (HTM) and noble metal electrodes (e.g. Au or Ag) also undermines the stability of PSCs and hinders their practical application as a new type of renewable energy conversion device.9 Among different strategies to improve the stability,10–12 replacing the A-site organic cations with inorganic ions (e.g. Cs+) has been proved to be an effective way to solve the intrinsic instability in perovskite materials,13,14 while the employment of carbon materials as the counter electrode in the so-called HTM-free carbon-based perovskite solar cells (C-PSCs) can make the devices more stable and cost-efficient.15–17
Among the various inorganic perovskites, the cubic phase CsPbI3 (α-CsPbI3) is very promising because it has a very suitable band gap (1.73 eV) for photovoltaic applications.18 However, the α-CsPbI3 is not stable at room temperature, and can spontaneously convert into a non-perovskite yellow phase (δ-CsPbI3); thus most CsPbI3 based PSCs show poor performance, especially C-PSCs. Current research is mainly focusing on how to stabilize the black α-CsPbI3 phase to improve the PCE. For instance, Hu et al. reported a compositional engineering approach via incorporating Bi3+ in CsPbI3 to stabilize the α-phase at room temperature, resulting in excellent stability as well as improved light absorption and electrical conductivity, achieving a high PCE of 13.21%.19 Recently, HPbI3 was chosen as the precursor with a stabilization effect in the deposition of α-CsPbI3. Xiang et al. believed this stabilization effect coming from the tensile lattice strain in the HPbI3-processed film, and they achieved a PCE of 9.5% in the HTM-free C-PSCs, with superb long term stability.18 However, Ke et al. argued that what appears to be all-inorganic CsPbI3 stabilized in its perovskite form using HPbI3 is, in fact, the hybrid perovskite cesium dimethylammonium lead iodide (Cs1−xDMAxPbI3, x = 0.2 to 0.5).20
Regardless of what approach was used for stabilizing the α-CsPbI3 phase, the PCE of CsPbI3 based C-PSCs was still far behind that of MAPbI3 based ones, mostly below 10%.17,18 Besides the phase impurity of α-CsPbI3, the low photovoltaic performance of C-PSCs was also attributed to the low quality of the perovskite/carbon interface. Most of the inorganic CsPbI3 based C-PSCs are fabricated with a paintable carbon paste deposited on perovskite directly by the doctor-blading process, which may lead to interface cracks or gaps. This insufficient contact leads to deficient charge extraction and transfer at the perovskite/carbon interface, and typically the fill factor (FF) in these devices was lower than 0.70.21,22 Moreover, trap states at grain boundaries (GBs) and surfaces as well as point defects such as interstitial defects or vacancies in the polycrystalline perovskite films can lead to strong surface recombination, resulting in severe energy losses and low performance in C-PSCs.23–25 Thus, improving the perovskite/carbon interface quality and lowering the carrier recombination caused by perovskite trap states are critical to achieving high-efficiency C-PSCs. In our previous studies, we optimized the perovskite/carbon interface in C-PSCs by designing a carbon nanotube (CNT) embedded structure, with partial CNTs implanted into perovskite crystals and forming a seamless perovskite/carbon interface, achieving a super high FF exceeding 0.75.22,26,27 Recently, Wang et al. reported a similar CNT bridging method by adding single-walled CNTs (SWCNTs) in both the perovskite and the carbon layers to form a high-quality perovskite/carbon interface, which not only facilitated charge extraction and transport between the two layers but also promoted the electrical conductivity of the carbon electrode.28 In the meantime, it was reported that trap states in perovskite films could be passivated with some organic molecule interlayers (e.g. polystyrene, phenylalkylamine, octadecylamine, etc.), which can coordinate with Pb ions and passivate the Lewis acid traps, suppressing interface recombination and improving the photovoltaic performance.29–33
Herein, we combined the merits of the embedded structure with the passivation interlayer and designed a polyethyleneimine-functionalized carbon nanotube (PEI/CNT) interlayer to work as a bifunctional interface bridge for CsPbI3 based all inorganic C-PSCs. This functionalized PEI/CNT interlayer not only connects the perovskite layer and carbon electrode to make a better perovskite/carbon interface, but also works as an interfacial passivation layer on the perovskite film. Through systematic investigation, we found that PEI molecules are anchored to the CsPbI3 framework by amino groups through the coordination effect between the lone pairs of –NH2 (–NH–) and Pb ions of perovskite or hydrogen bonding between H atoms of –NH2 (–NH–) and iodide ions, thus passivating the surface trap states in perovskite. In devices, the interfacial charge transfer resistance was also reduced because of the bridged high-quality perovskite/carbon interface. This effort led to a remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 10.55% with a higher fill factor (FF) of 0.71 for the all inorganic C-PSCs. By contrast, those without the PEI/CNT bridge only gained a PCE of 7.41% and FF of 0.56. Moreover, this PEI/CNT based non-encapsulated device showed higher stability under high humidity (70%) or high temperature (80 °C) in an air atmosphere.
2. Results and discussion
The schematic device architecture of the C-PSC formed from a low-cost carbon paste with the PEI/CNT bridge at the perovskite/carbon interface is shown in Fig. 1a. A compact TiO2 (c-TiO2) and a mesoscopic TiO2 (m-TiO2) scaffold layer were deposited on the FTO glass prior to the perovskite film to work as the hole-blocking layer and electron transport layer, respectively. The PEI/CNT interlayer bridge was deposited and partially embedded into the perovskite film during the anti-solvent dripping process. Finally, the low-cost carbon paste was deposited as the counter electrode via doctor-blading. In this structure, the PEI/CNT interlayer was designed to work with two functions, one is to bridge the perovskite film and carbon electrode through CNTs to achieve better quality of the perovskite/carbon interface and improve charge collection and transport efficiency, and the other one is to passivate the defect states on the surface region of the perovskite crystal via the interaction of PEI molecules and perovskite (Fig. 1b). The PEI/CNT composite was synthesized following the schematic route in Fig. 1c. In step 1, CNTs were first oxidized by the mixed acids (sulphuric and nitric acid) to introduce carboxylic groups onto the nanotube surface. Then, PEI molecules were attached to CNTs via the dehydration reaction between carboxylic groups and amino groups.34 PEI molecules with different molecular weights (MW) were used in our experiment to optimize the device performance.

Working as the interlayer in devices, the morphology of CNTs has a critical impact on the quality and properties for charge transporting. We conducted SEM to check the morphology evolution of CNTs before and after PEI functionalization. As indicated in Fig. 2a and b, pristine CNTs showed the complete network morphology, with a nanotube diameter of 10 nm and a length of several micrometres. After the acid treatment and PEI functionalization in the present study, the tube length seemed shorter, but the CNT network was more compact, without obvious changes in the diameter. It was reported that pristine CNTs are in the form of bundles, and these bundles break into separate nanotubes due to extensive refluxing during the treatments.35 And treatment of CNTs with strong acids followed by an amine solution usually shortens the length of CNTs.34 The enhanced compactness of CNT films is beneficial for achieving sufficient contact between perovskite and CNTs and guaranteeing fast charge extraction and transfer at this perovskite/carbon interface.

To corroborate the incorporation of PEI into the CNT surface, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was performed for the pristine CNTs (pure CNT) and their derivatives (COOH-CNT and PEI-CNT), and the corresponding results are shown in Fig. 2c. As indicated, pure CNTs without any treatment exhibit a few peaks, indicating the presence of small fractions of functional groups most likely incorporated during the synthesis process.36 After chemical oxidation of COOH-CNT, a new broad peak at 3425 cm−1 is observed and should be due to the O–H stretching vibration of hydroxyl groups, and the peak at 1715 cm−1 corresponds to the CO stretching vibration of carboxylic groups attached to CNTs. These two peaks are an indication of acid functionalization.35 The FTIR spectrum of PEI-CNT confirmed the formation of amide groups on the CNT surface. The peaks at 1263 cm−1 and 1450 cm−1 are ascribed to C–N stretching of amide groups, while the peak at 1565 cm−1 can be assigned to the N–H in-plane deformation vibration for primary amines. The FTIR spectrum exhibits a broad peak at 3434 cm−1 which is associated with the N–H stretching vibration for amine groups, which overlapped with the O–H stretching present in COOH-CNT.
In order to detect the interaction between PEI molecules and the perovskite, we performed attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) and collected the transmission spectra of CsPbI3, PEI (1300) and PEI (1300) + CsPbI3 mixed solutions in DMF. As shown in Fig. 3, the CO vibration band at 1657 cm−1 in all three types of solutions belongs to the solvent of DMF. For the neat PEI solution, the peaks at 3275 cm−1 and 1560 cm−1 are assigned to the N–H stretching vibration and the deformation vibration, and the peak at 1306 cm−1 is assigned to the C–N stretching vibration. After mixing with CsPbI3, the observed peaks for N–H and C–N vibration in PEI become much weaker, which confirmed the presence of interaction between PEI and CsPbI3. More specifically, both N–H stretching vibration and deformation vibration peaks shift to a lower wavenumber at 3265 cm−1 and 1554 cm−1, respectively, and the C–N stretching vibration also shifts to 1287 cm−1 from 1306 cm−1. These weaker vibration peaks of N–H and C–N bonds and their red shift verify that the PEI molecules can anchor to the CsPbI3 framework through amino groups, and there could be a coordination effect between the lone pairs of –NH2 and Pb ions of perovskite or hydrogen bonding between H atoms of –NH2 and iodide ions.29,37–39

Finally, we measured the photoluminescence (PL) to study the PL light excitation in perovskites to shed light on the effect of the interface PEI/CNT interlayer on device performance. Generally, the spontaneous radiative recombination between trap states leads to a red-shifted emission peak compared with that from the band edge transition, and passivation of these trap states can blue-shift the PL peak, which is illustrated in Fig. 4a.23,40 The geometry of the PL measurement is shown in Fig. 4b, in which the incident excitation light (514 nm laser) either from the FTO side or from the air side and the PL from perovskite films with partly embedded PEI/CNTs were measured. As shown in the optical microscope picture, the surface of perovskite was not fully covered with PEI/CNTs, leaving some parts exposed to the air (Fig. 4c). When the laser was incident from the FTO side, the PL emission peak was at 724 nm. As the laser has a penetration length of ∼80 nm, much less than the thickness of the perovskite film (300 nm), we can confirm that this 724 nm PL emission belongs to pure CsPbI3. When the laser was incident from the air side at point A, the PL peak shifted to 722 nm. After the incident laser was moved to point B where it was at the boundary of perovskite and the PEI/CNT interlayer, it has a largely blue-shifted PL peak at 720 nm (Fig. 4d). These results indicate that the embedded PEI/CNT interlayer can passivate the trap states close to the perovskite surface, especially near the contact area between the PEI/CNT interlayer and perovskite. The passivation mechanism should be attributed to the coordination interaction between the amino groups in PEI molecules and Pb ions or hydrogen bonding with iodide ions. It was reported that the charge recombination at the perovskite surface severely reduces the carrier extraction efficiency,23,41,42 while PEI/CNTs on the perovskite films can effectively passivate these traps and markedly reduce the interfacial charge recombination, which can boost the JSC and FF of devices.

The critical factor affecting the device photovoltaic performance comes from the crystal quality of CsPbI3. For the all inorganic CsPbI3 deposition, dimethyl formamide (DMF)·HI·PbI2 was employed to replace PbI2 as the precursor, because the DMF·HI·PbI2 processed CsPbI3 film could stabilize in the perovskite phase (α-CsPbI3) more easily due to the reported tensile lattice strain.18 The as-prepared DMF·HI·PbI2 powder in this work is shown in Fig. S1a† and is light yellow powder as described in other studies.43 The XRD patterns in Fig. S1b† compared the different phase characteristics in PbI2, DMF·HI·PbI2 and CsPbI3. PbI2 has a characteristic peak at 12.5°; after the reaction with HI, it was completely converted into DMF·HI·PbI2, which has a different new peak with PbI2 at approximately 11°. The as-deposited CsPbI3 film with this DMF·HI·PbI2 powder as the precursor was well stabilized in the perovskite phase (black), with a tiny peak belonging to the unconverted DMF·HI·PbI2. This well stabilized α-CsPbI3 eliminated the influence of perovskite phase impurity on the device performance.
The cross-sectional SEM image in Fig. 5a demonstrates the device structure after PEI/CNT solution dripping. The PEI/CNT interlayer was partially embedded in the perovskite layer. A more specific top-view SEM image of one selected area clearly indicates the one-side implantation state of CNTs into the perovskite crystal, leaving the other side outside the film (Fig. 5b). Most of the outside part of CNTs grew upward, with the length as long as several micrometres, which could be easily integrated into carbon paste during the doctor-blading process to form the interfacial bridges. These prior embedded CNTs would work as the highway for rapid carrier separation and transport from the perovskite film to the later deposited carbon electrode.

The current–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the three types of C-PSCs are displayed in Fig. 5c. The data in Table 1 are the corresponding photovoltaic parameters. Obviously, the C-PSCs without the interface PEI/CNT bridge exhibited a lower performance, with a JSC of 17.18 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.77 V, FF of 0.56 and PCE of 7.41%. In contrast, the C-PSCs with the PEI/CNTs (MW ∼ 1300) as interface bridges achieved a much better performance, with a JSC of 18.58 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.80 V, an FF of 0.71 and a remarkable PCE of 10.55%, where MW 1300 is the molecular weight of PEI. The efficiency was improved by about 42.38% in devices with the PEI/CNT (MW ∼ 1300) interlayer compared with those without it, and this was mainly attributed to the improved FF (0.71 versus 0.56). The PEI/CNTs connected the perovskite with the carbon electrode, making the interface more integrated and in better contact, which enhanced the exciton separation and carrier transport.44 The device with the PEI/CNT bridge also demonstrated smaller hysteresis than that of the control samples without the PEI/CNT bridge due to the reduced trap states in the perovskite film33 (Fig. S2†). When another PEI with a much higher molecular weight (750000) was employed, the processed C-PSCs exhibited a much lower performance, with the JSC decreased by 11.47% and FF decreased to 0.61, and the final PCE was only 5.51%, which can be ascribed to the insulating nature of PEI.45 It was reported that PEI with a higher molecular weight has a much longer alkyl chain and is more insulating, and thus may hinder the charge transport from perovskite to the carbon electrode. We also compared the photovoltaic performance of C-PSCs with and without the interlayer containing only PEI molecules, and the results are shown in Fig. S3.† Both the JSC and FF showed obvious improvement for the device with PEI, and the final PCE was promoted from 7.41% to 8.66%. This improvement should be attributed to the above-discussed passivation effect on the CsPbI3 film of PEI molecules, which reduced the interfacial charge recombination process.33 The reproducibility of devices with the PEI/CNT bridge was evaluated by characterizing about 20 cells. The statistical deviations of the photovoltaic parameters shown in Fig. S4† indicate their excellent reproducibility.

The incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra exhibit a photocurrent response from 365 nm to 750 nm (Fig. 5d). Compared with C-PSCs without PEI/CNT bridges, the C-PSCs with PEI/CNT bridges show higher IPCE values in the long wavelength region and their integrated photocurrent densities are 15.4 mA cm−2 and 17.4 mA cm−2, respectively. That is well consistent with the JSC extracted from the J–V curves. The increased JSC should be attributed to the better charge separation ability at the high-quality perovskite/carbon interface as well as reduced defect states from the passivation effect of PEI molecules in devices with the bifunctional PEI/CNT bridge.
The interfacial charge transport processes of C-PSCs without or with the PEI/CNT bridge were investigated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) characterization. The measurement was performed under illumination under short-circuit conditions between 2 MHz and 1 Hz. The Nyquist plots for these two kinds of devices and corresponding Bode plots are shown in Fig. 5e and f. Only one semicircle is obtained for both devices in the Nyquist plots, and correspondingly, in the Bode phase plots, there is only a single peak detected in the high frequency area (104 to 105 Hz). An equivalent circuit which fits the EIS plots is displayed in the inset of Fig. 5e. Under this measurement condition, the photocurrent is extremely high and EIS provides information regarding the charge transfer resistance (Rct) and series resistance (Rs), without an obvious charge recombination process.46 As expected, the C-PSC with PEI/CNTs as interface bridges has a smaller Rs value (20.6 Ω) than that without these interface bridges (25.9 Ω), indicating the high conductivity of CNTs. Besides, the PEI/CNT based device also has a lower Rct value (349.3 Ω) compared with that without PEI/CNTs (407.7 Ω). As both devices contain a similar structure except the perovskite/carbon interface, the difference in Rct is mainly attributed to the different charge transfer dynamics at the perovskite/carbon interface. These results reveal that C-PSCs with PEI/CNTs as interface bridges have better interface contact and enhanced charge extraction and transfer properties, which contribute to the improved photovoltaic performance in devices.
Finally, we evaluated the stability of the as-fabricated C-PSCs with the interface PEI/CNT bridges. We first measured the steady-state photocurrent output at the maximum power point (MPP, 0.59 V). As shown in Fig. S5,† the photocurrent and the corresponding PCE rise quickly to the maximum when the light is turned on, followed by a slight decrease in a few seconds, finally stabilizing during the continuous 300 s illumination. The stabilized PCE was 10.31%, well consistent with the J–V curves. The long-term stability of C-PSCs under continuous full-sun illumination with MPP tracking in air was also compared. As indicated in Fig. 6a, there was only an 11% efficiency drop after 600 h of continuous illumination measurement for the device with the PEI/CNT bridge, much better than that without the PEI/CNT bridge. We also measured the long-term stability under high humidity and high temperature conditions in air. The two kinds of unencapsulated CsPbI3 based C-PSCs without or with interlayer PEI/CNT bridges were stored in air with the humidity around 70% at 80 °C and were tested every a few days. After two weeks, the PEI/CNT based device still retained 80% of its initial efficiency, and that without the PEI/CNT bridge experienced a faster degradation and only had 68% efficiency remaining (Fig. 6b). This better stability can be attributed to the coordination interaction between perovskite and PEI molecules, which may improve the device stability by suppressing the perovskite decomposition and phase segregation via the increased van der Waals interactions and steric effect.29,31,47

3. Conclusions
In conclusion, we have demonstrated an effective device structure for high-stability and high-performance all inorganic CsPbI3 based C-PSCs by inserting a bifunctional PEI/CNT bridging layer into the perovskite/carbon interface. With this interlayer rich in amine functional groups, we achieved a remarkable PCE of 10.55% and an obviously improved FF of 0.71. By contrast, the average PCE of C-PSCs without the PEI/CNT bridge was only 7.41%, and as expected, the FF was only 0.56. Through systematic investigations, we found that the surface trap states of perovskite were reduced and the charge transport at the perovskite/carbon interface was more efficient. This PEI/CNT based device also showed its superiority in both humidity and thermal stability due to the coordination interaction and steric effect between perovskite and PEI molecules. Therefore, the bifunctional interface bridging strategy with PEI/CNTs appears to be effective for achieving high efficiency and high stability for all inorganic C-PSCs.
