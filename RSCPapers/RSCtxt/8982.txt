    , Accepted 12th July 2018First published on 12th July 2018AbstractLi–S rechargeable batteries are desirable for electric transportation because of their low cost, environmental friendliness, and superior energy density. However, the Li–S system has yet to conquer the market owing to its drawbacks such as soluble polysulfide formation. To tackle this issue, we report herein a strategy based on the use of a micro-porous copper metal–organic framework named CuMOF as a host material for sulfur immobilization via chemical bonds between sulfur and the MOF structure. CuMOF has been obtained by simple chemical synthesis using copper salt and benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxylic acid as the ligand. Then, by the melt-diffusion method, sulfur-impregnated CuMOFS material is finally fabricated. As a cathode material for Li–S batteries, the CuMOFS cathode delivers a capacity of 1051.3 mA h g−1 after 300 cycles at a charge/discharge current density of 200 mA g−1. It is worth noting that the main cathode structure can retain more than 19.3 wt% sulfur due to the CuMOF host, which dramatically decreases capacity fading and improves coulombic efficiency during prolonged charge/discharge cycling. The XPS peaks of CuMOFS are assigned according to the information obtained from density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Linear scaling DFT structure relaxation for a model with >1000 atoms is carried out to exemplify the interactions between CuMOF framework and embedded Li2S. The excellent electrochemical performance can be due to firm confinement of sulfur/polysulfides because of strong chemical interactions between carbon and sulfur species in the CuMOF host.
1. Introduction
Lithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries have recently drawn considerable attention as they exhibit remarkable energy density and extreme low cost compared to current state-of-the-art lithium–ion batteries.1,2 Li–S batteries work based on the electrochemical reaction S8 + 16Li ↔ 8Li2S,3 which results in high theoretical specific capacity of sulfur at 1675 mA h g−1. With an average cell voltage of 2.15 V, lithium–sulfur batteries have a high theoretical gravimetric energy density of 2500 W h kg−1 or volumetric energy density of 2800 W h L−1, which is 3–5 fold higher than that of traditional lithium-ion batteries.4–6 Moreover, sulfur is inexpensive and abundant in the earth's crust, which makes Li–S batteries a particularly attractive and low-cost energy storage technology.7,8 However, the practical applications of Li–S batteries are hindered by several issues, especially fast capacity fading and low efficiency, caused by the formation of polysulfide having low electronic conductivity and its dissolution in organic liquid electrolytes.9–11
To prevent polysulfide solubility and further improve the electrochemical performance of Li–S batteries, primary efforts have been devoted for several years. On the one hand, modifying electrolyte formulation and using polymer replacing of liquid electrolytes were attempted.12–14 On the other hand, designing confined sulfur-containing composites to capture polysulfide species within the electrode configuration was of primary focus.15,16 Most studied sulfur-containing composites can be divided into two categories: carbon/sulfur17–25 and polymer/sulfur.26,27 The former relies on the use of ordered mesoporous carbon, carbon nanotube, or graphene carbon materials to provide both an electronic percolation pathway and adequately controlled porosity to retain electrochemically generated polysulfide species. The latter provides mechanical resilience as well as polymeric backbones with inter- and/or intra-chains to immobilize polysulfides. Although the above two composite structures have led to superior electrochemical performances in terms of capacity retention, they are still insufficient for practical applications.28–30 Besides, weak physical and chemical confinements of carbon/sulfur and polymer/sulfur composites cause a few soluble polysulfides to escape from the carbon or polymer channels, leading to capacity loss upon several cycles.31,32 As a result, finding an ideal matrix with enhanced sulfur configuration is crucial for obtaining better cycling capability over numerous cycles.
Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), a new class of porous crystalline materials, which are assembled by metal centers and organic functional linkers, have rapidly attracted tremendous research attention over the last two decades.33,34 The key structural features of MOFs are high porosity and surface area, which make MOFs outstanding candidates for clean energy applications such as hydrogen storage, fuel cells, Li–ion batteries, supercapacitors, and solar cells.35–39 In 2011, Tarascon first employed mesoporous chromium trimesate MIL-100(Cr) (Cr3O(H2O)F(BTC)2) as a host for cathode materials in Li–S batteries. Sulfur was impregnated within the pores of MIL-100(Cr) by melt-diffusion at 155 °C to obtain MIL-100(Cr)/S@155, which was then ball-milled with carbon black to form the cathode material. As compared to mesoporous carbon host for sulfur, MIL-100(Cr)/S@155 with 50% carbon additive showed significantly higher capacity retention after 60 cycles.40 This result encouraged further research into designing appropriate MOFs with flexibility in pore size as sulfur confinement hosts in Li–S batteries. In 2013, Banglin Chen and Guodong Qian utilized Cu-MOF (HKUST-1) as the host material to trap 40 wt% sulfur into its matrices to achieve KUST-1⊃S composite, and its capacity improved to 500 mA h g−1 after 170 cycles.41 Subsequently, Zn-MOF (ZIF-8),42,43 Al-MOF (MIL-53, NH2-MIL-53),42 graphene-wrapped Cr-MOF (MIL-101),44 Ni-MOF,45 Zr-MOF (MOF-525),46 and many other MOF/three dimensional (3D) composite materials47–49 were used as sulfur hosts to obtain high electrochemical performance of MOF/S cathodes. Although these cathodes have shown some improvements with respect to capacity decay and coulombic efficiency, electrochemical performance of MOF/S cathodes still needs further improvement to meet the demands of high-capacity and high-power energy storage devices.
Herein, we report the preparation of Cu-MOF with micro-sized pores as a matrix host to impregnate sulfur. By the melt diffusion method,40,45 sulfur can be effectively embedded into the Cu-MOF structure. Additionally, XPS measurements and DFT calculations confirm that Li2S can be confined in Cu-MOF building blocks with fundamental interactions between them. The sulfur-embedded Cu-MOF cathodes show high specific capacity, improved cycle stability, and high coulombic efficiency during prolonged charge/discharge cycling.
2. Experimental
2.1 Chemicals and reagents
Cu(NO3)2·3H2O was purchased from Tianjin Fuchen Chemical Reagents Factory, China. Benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxylic acid, ethanol, and sublimated sulfur were purchased from Tianjin Jiangtiantongyi Technology Co. Ltd, China. Dimethylformamide (DMF) was purchased from Tianjin Fengchuan Chemical Reagent Techonology Co. Ltd, China. Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) was purchased from Alfar Aesar, USA. Acetylene black was purchased from Ensaco, Switzerland. The Celgard 2400 separator was obtained from Celgard, US. Lithium foil was purchased from Tianjin Zhongneng Lithium Products Co. Ltd, China. Li–S cell electrolyte was purchased from Guotai-Huarong New Chemical Materials Co. Ltd, China.
2.2 Synthesis of CuMOF
A mixture of 2.89 g of Cu(NO3)2·3H2O, 1.60 g of benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxylic acid, 150 mL of DMF, and 150 mL of ethanol was added to a 500 mL flask and stirred for 60 min at room temperature. Then, the flask was tightly sealed and heated at 85 °C for 20 h. Subsequently, the mixture was cooled naturally to room temperature. The precipitate was filtered and washed with ethanol three times and then dried at 80 °C overnight in a vacuum oven, thus obtaining a sky blue powder labeled as CuMOF.
2.3 Synthesis of CuMOFS
CuMOF powders and sulfur powders were mixed in weight ratios of 1:1, 1:2, and 1:3. They were ground by hand in an argon-filled glovebox. Then, the CuMOF and sulfur mixtures were transferred to separate Al2O3 crucibles in an alumina tube furnace. The mixture samples were heated at 155 °C for 10 h under an argon flow in the furnace. After cooling naturally, homogeneous blue-green powders were obtained. These powders were ground in mortars and labeled as CuMOF1S1, CuMOF1S2, and CuMOF1S3 for the CuMOF and S weight ratios of 1:1, 1:2, and 1:3, respectively.
2.4 Fabrication of cathode materials
CuMOFS cathodes were fabricated by mixing CuMOFS powders with acetylene black and PTFE binder in a weight ratio of 5:3:2. After the addition of ethanol, the mixtures were stirred at room temperature to form homogeneous slurries. Then, they were coated onto an aluminum foil current collector and dried at 70 °C under vacuum for 24 h. A pure sulfur cathode was prepared using the same procedure.
2.5 Cell assembly
The 2032 coin cells were assembled in an argon-filled glovebox with as-prepared CuMOFS cathodes, Li foil as counter electrodes, and a Celgard 2400 film separator; 1 M lithium bis(trifluoromethane sulfone)imide (LiTFSI) with 1 wt% LiNO3 was dissolved in a mixture of 1,3-dioxilane (DOL) and dimethoxyethane (DME) (1:1 in volume) as the electrolyte.
2.6 Cell testing
Galvanostatic charge–discharge cycle tests were carried out on a battery testing system (LAND 2001A, Wuhan Jinnuo Corp., China) at a current density of 200 mA g−1 between 1.5 and 2.6 V.
2.7 Material characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were conducted on a Rigaku D8A X-ray diffractometer (Bruker, Germany) using CuKα radiation (λ = 0.154 nm) in 2θ range of 5–60°. Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) were performed under N2 using the TGA Q600 system (TA Instruments, US). N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms were obtained at liquid nitrogen temperatures using an ASAP 2020 analyzer (Micromeritics, USA). Pore size distribution was determined by the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method. The samples were heated from room temperature to 600 °C at a heating rate of 20 °C min−1. The morphologies of the samples were characterized with a scanning electron microscopy system (SEM, FEI Nova Nano 2300) with an accelerating voltage of 15 kV. XPS measurements were performed on an X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (PHI-5000, USA) using a monochromatic AlKα (1486.7 eV) source at a voltage of 15 kV and emission current of 10 mA.
2.8 Computational method
Density functional theory (DFT) was employed to model CuMOF structures and XPS binding energies. We proposed a model for CuMOF composite and optimized its structure using the PBE functional.50 This model consists of >1000 atoms, and it is intractable by conventional DFT algorithm. The linear scaling DFT simulation package OpenMX was employed to render structure relaxation feasible.51 To facilitate the assignment of XPS spectra peaks, a localized segment was extracted from this model to create a motif for XPS calculations, which represented the structure environment pattern of CuMOF. All XPS predictions were carried out using the Gaussian 16 simulation package.52 The structure was optimized at the TPSSh/6-31+G(d,p) level.53 The C1s orbital energy was computed using the same functional with larger basis set 6-311++G(d,p). A correction factor (8.3) was applied to move the center of the predicted values and align it with the experimental one. LANL2DZ effective core potential (ECP) was used for Cu atoms in the model.54
3. Results and discussion
The structures of the CuMOFS composites are analyzed by XRD. After heating at 155 °C, it is observed that there is no change in the CuMOF structure, as shown in Fig. S1 of the ESI,† which indicates that the CuMOF structure is stable and remains robust. This observation is also confirmed by XRD (Fig. 1a); the result indicates that the crystalline structure of the MOF remains intact, and traces of crystalline sulfur are detected after sulfur impregnation at 155 °C. Sulfur weight ratios in the CuMOFS composites are determined using TGA curves under an N2 atmosphere, as shown in Fig. 1b. For comparison, TGA curves of pure sulfur and pristine CuMOF are also presented. Pure sulfur exhibits one-step weight loss, which ranges from 190 °C to nearly 300 °C. Although the weight loss for CuMOFS composites lies in the same temperature range, the starting points are slightly lower than that of pure sulfur, which may be caused by different chemical or physical interactions and chemical bond environments between sulfur and MOF hosts. We can notice that at the same 190–300 °C interval, pristine CuMOF decomposes slightly with weight loss of about 15–20 wt%. This weight loss is due to the loss of crystallized water from the MOF structure, which has also been reported in previous studies on sulfur-embedded MOF cathode materials.42,44,46,48,55 Accordingly, the weights of sulfur in each of the CuMOFS composites are equal to the total weight loss minus weight loss of pristine CuMOF in the temperature range of 190–300 °C. The calculated weights of sulfur in CuMOFS composites are 17.12 wt%, 37.36 wt%, and 45.80 wt%.

N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm of CuMOF (Fig. 1c) is a typical Type I isotherm with a sharp uptake at low relative pressure, indicating that the pores in CuMOF material are mostly micropores. This is further confirmed by the close values of micropore volume (0.31 cm3 g−1) and total pore volume (0.36 cm3 g−1). The presence of abundant micropores results in a high Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area of 737.32 m2 g−1. The narrow pore size distribution calculated by the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method (Fig. 1d) confirms the uniform size of the micropores in the CuMOF material.
SEM images in Fig. 2 show that the crystals of pristine CuMOF are non-uniform and irregularly shaped with diameters of about 2–5 μm (Fig. 2a and b). After sulfur impregnation at 155 °C, CuMOFS composites retained their crystalline feature, and no bulk sulfur was observed on the surface of CuMOF. Besides, crystal sizes of CuMOFS were larger than those of the pristine CuMOF crystals (Fig. 2c and d); this indicated that sulfur may be incorporated into the pores of the CuMOF crystal matrix to expand the crystal volume without destroying its main structure. As shown in Fig. 2e, element mapping images of CuMOF1S2 indicated uniform distribution of sulfur among the CuMOF crystals, which further confirmed that sulfur had infiltrated the CuMOF structure units.

XPS measurements were carried out to further identify the chemical nature of the CuMOFS material. To determine whether there are chemical bonds between sulfur and MOF, we investigated C 1s, S 2p, and Cu 2p spectra of CuMOF1S2, pristine CuMOF, and pristine sulfur. First, upon comparison of the C 1s spectrum of CuMOF (Fig. 3a) and that of CuMOF1S2 (Fig. 3b), four peaks corresponding to carbon atoms in different functional groups were observed. Each independent peak of CuMOF1S2 with binding energies of 284.1, 285.8, 287.9, and 289.0 eV had slightly higher intensity than the corresponding peaks of pristine CuMOF, which indicated recreation of carbon and oxygen in the MOF structure. The change in the C 1s spectrum of CuMOFS composite was in agreement with previously reported results.38,40,49,56 Meanwhile, the binding energies were predicted at 285.0, 286.4, 287.6, and 288.0 eV with DFT simulations. By comparing experimental and predicted data values, contributing sites for each XPS peak were assigned, and they are shown in Fig. 4a. Second, after comparing S2p spectra of pristine sulfur (Fig. 3c) and CuMOF1S2 (Fig. 3d), we inferred that the S 2p spectrum of CuMOF1S2 exhibited binding energies of 163.1 and 164.3 eV, which were higher than those of pristine sulfur (binding energies, 162.8 and 163.9 eV); this indicated that the chemical states of sulfur in CuMOF are different from those in pristine sulfur. This may be due to chemical interactions between sulfur and MOFs, which was consistent with other published results.23,41,46,48,56,57 Third, after comparing Cu 2p spectra of pristine CuMOF (Fig. 3e) and CuMOF1S2 (Fig. 3f), we inferred that the chemical valence of Cu in CuMOF and CuMOFS exhibited no change, which indicated that the sulfur atom does not directly interact with the copper atom in the CuMOFS structure. Therefore, we can speculate that in the CuMOF structure, sulfur may chemically bond with the carbon and oxygen atoms and not with the copper atom. To illustrate the interaction between CuMOF and Li2S after lithiation, the proposed structure is shown in Fig. 4b. Fig. 4c depicts the corresponding micropores, which are formed by the molecular surface of the CuMOF framework.

As shown in Fig. 5a, CuMOFS cathodes display much better cycling performance than pure sulfur cathode; the CuMOF1S2 cathode shows the best cycle stability and reversible capacity at a current density of 200 mA h g−1. CuMOFS cathodes in the order of increasing sulfur contents reveal large initial delithiation capacities of 1647, 1610, 1513 mA h g−1. Although the CuMOFS cathodes suffer continuous irreversible capacity fading during the first 70 cycles, which is typically observed in other types of cathode materials, their capacities stay nearly unchanged from 70th to 300th cycles. Up to the 70th cycle, delithiation decay of CuMOF1S2 is 43% lower than that of pure sulfur cathode. The delithiation capacity of CuMOF1S2 after the 70th cycle is still 1048 mA h g−1, and it remains steady until the 300th cycle. This remarkably high capacity retention of CuMOF1S2 cathode can be ascribed to the unique pore shape of CuMOF matrix, which essentially slows down the polysulfide dissolution into the electrolyte. Additionally, the CuMOF structure only acts as the sulfur host with minimal contribution to the capacity of the CuMOFS cathode, which can be proven by the cycle performance of pristine CuMOF, as shown in Fig. S4 of the ESI.†

Fig. 5b shows coulombic efficiency (%) of CuMOFS cathodes compared with that of pure sulfur cathode at 1–300 charge–discharge cycles. At the first cycle, coulombic efficiencies of CuMOFS cathodes are about 98.5–99.4%, which are about 34% higher than that of pure sulfur cathode. During the 300 cycles, the curves of total coulombic efficiencies of CuMOFS cathodes are flat and even, whereas the curve of pure sulfur cathode is uneven and unsteady. This indicates that polysulfides are effectively immobilized in the pores of the CuMOFS host, which can improve the coulombic efficiency of the cathodes.

Fig. 5c shows first discharge and charge curves of CuMOFS and pure sulfur cathodes at a charge/discharge current density of 200 mA g−1. The first discharge curves of CuMOFS cathodes show two typical discharge platforms at about 2.36 and 2.10 V, the second being slightly higher than that of pure sulfur curve. First charge curves of CuMOFS cathodes show one typical charge platform at about 2.19 V, which is slightly lower than that of the pure sulfur curve. These changes might be due to the strongly confined sulfur inside the pores of CuMOF structures. In addition, the two discharge plateaus correspond to cathode reactions of S8 → Li2Sx (x ≥ 4) and Li2Sx (x ≥ 4) → Li2Sx (x < 4).58,59 The charge plateau is due to conversion of Li2S and polysulfides into elemental S.60,61
Specific capacity–potential curves of CuMOF1S1, CuMOF1S2, CuMOF1S3 cathodes at 1st, 10th, 20th, 50th and 100th cycles are shown in Fig. S2a of the ESI,†Fig. 5d, and Fig. S2b of the ESI.† From the 1st to 100th cycle, charge/discharge plateaus became shorter, indicating that the capacity of CuMOFS cathode fades irreversibly. Concurrently, the discharge plateau becomes higher, and the charge platform becomes lower, which also suggests gradual fading of capacity with each cycle. Such electrochemical behavior indicates that although the porous CuMOFS matrix can further prevent the diffusion of polysulfides into the electrolyte, some amount of sulfide species dissolve into the electrolyte, leading to capacity decay.
To ascertain the positive effects of the CuMOF host on the improvement of sulfur cathodes, we compared the morphologies of CuMOF1S2 and pure sulfur cathodes before and after 300 cycles, as shown in Fig. 6. There was not a clear change in the CuMOF1S2 cathode before (Fig. 6a and b) and after 300 cycles (Fig. 6c and d), whereas the morphology of pure sulfur cathode changed substantially before (Fig. 6e and f) and after 300 cycles (Fig. 6g and h). To further illustrate the differences, Table 1 shows the changes in weight percent of elements on the surfaces of CuMOFS and pure sulfur cathodes before and after 300 cycles, as determined by EDX analysis. There was only 0.5 wt% change in the sulfur content for the CuMOF1S2 cathode before and after cycling, whereas the change was 19.8 wt% for pure sulfur cathode before and after cycling; this indicated that without the CuMOF host, more than 19.3 wt% sulfur could be lost from the cathode, leading to capacity fading. Therefore, the CuMOF structure hosts polysulfides during cycling by preventing the polysulfide species from dissolving in the electrolyte.

4. Conclusion
CuMOFS composites containing sulfur species confined in micro-sized pores of the crystal matrix have been successfully fabricated by the sulfur melt-diffusion method. As a cathode material for Li–S batteries, the CuMOF1S2 cathode exhibits capacity of 1051.3 mA h g−1 at 300th cycle with charge/discharge current density of 200 mA g−1. This excellent electrochemical performance can be due to firm confinement of sulfur/polysulfides and enhanced charge transfer ability by the robust CuMOF host. With XPS measurements, we can confirm that there are chemical interactions among carbon, oxygen, and sulfur species in the MOF structure, which can prevent sulfur species from dissolving in the electrolyte, leading to low capacity decay and excellent coulombic efficiency.
