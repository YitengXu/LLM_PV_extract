    , Accepted 27th June 2013First published on 3rd July 2013AbstractThe charge separation and charge recombination dynamics in P3HT–ZnO and P3HT–dye–ZnO bulk heterojunction organic–inorganic hybrid solar cells (OIHSCs) prepared by a one-pot method were studied using a transient absorption (TA) method, both for optical absorption of P3HT in the visible region and for optical absorption of SQ36 in the NIR region. In the case of P3HT–ZnO, the charge separation was very fast, occurring within 1 ps. On the other hand, high charge recombination between electrons in the surface states and/or the conduction band of ZnO and holes in P3HT was observed. In the case of P3HT–dye–ZnO, we found that the charge recombination could be greatly suppressed by locating the dye at the P3HT/ZnO interfaces while maintaining a fast charge separation rate (a few ps to 10 ps). Our findings provide one methodology for the design of OIHSCs for improving their conversion efficiency, which is to position the dye at the appropriate BHJ interfaces.
Organic–inorganic hybrid solar cells (OIHSC) have attracted much interest in recent years as promising candidates for future low-cost photovoltaics.1 This is because of the unique properties of each of their constituent materials, such as their high dielectric constants, fast charge transport, the relative environmental stability of the inorganic materials, and the low-cost processing of organic materials with intrinsic flexibility. Poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) is one of the common organic donors and light harvesting materials, which can absorb visible light up to 650 nm. Various inorganic nano-materials, such as CdSe,2 CdTe,3 PbS,4 TiO25–8 and ZnO9–14 have been applied to OIHSCs as acceptors. Among these inorganic materials, ZnO nanostructures have attracted much attention and have been extensively investigated. The advantages of using ZnO include its low-cost, ease of deposition, lack of toxicity, and transparency in the visible region. OIHSCs comprise interpenetrating donor–acceptor networks on the nanometer scale with separate organic and inorganic materials, the so-called bulk heterojunctions (BHJs), which are similar to those prepared in organic photovoltaics (OPVs).15 However, to date, OIHSCs have not lived up to their potential because of the poor interface properties of the heterojunctions. Thus engineering the donor/acceptor interface and controlling the charge separation and recombination at the interfaces are crucial for optimizing device performance and improving the photovoltaic energy conversion efficiency of OIHSCs. Meanwhile, to improve the light harvesting properties of OIHSCs, several approaches have been proposed, such as employing narrow band gap polymers instead of P3HT,16–18 sensitization using dyes,19,20 or the use of semiconductor quantum dots2–4,21 to cover a wide range of wavelengths in the solar spectrum including the visible and near infrared (NIR) regions.
Recently, Hayase and coworkers have fabricated dye-sensitized OIHSCs by a one-pot preparation process, using a solution based ZnO precursor (diethyl zinc: DEZ) for the acceptor material, P3HT as the donor material, and a squaraine dye (SQ36) as a sensitizer.22 The molecular structure of SQ36 is shown in Fig. S1 in the ESI.†22 A homogeneous mixture of DEZ, P3HT and the dye is used to make a coating under controlled humidity. During the layer formation, DEZ decomposes to form ZnO which grows in the polymer with the dye. P3HT covers the wavelengths from 400 nm to 650 nm and the dye covers the NIR region beyond 650 nm. An energy conversion efficiency of 1% has been achieved with these cells.22 The one-pot preparation method is very simple and produces low cost solar cells. In the case of stepwise processes for OIHSCs, it is difficult to fill the nanopores in the ZnO (or TiO2) with P3HT.21 However, by employing the one-pot preparation method, the ZnO can grow continuously in the polymer to form the BHJs.
Similar to OPVs, the fundamental charge dynamic processes in OIHSCs are as follows.21 (1) Optical absorption occurs in the organic material (P3HT here) generating excitons. (2) The excitons do not dissociate into free carriers at room temperature but they can diffuse randomly in organic domains, where some of them reach a donor (organic)/acceptor (inorganic) interface. (3) The excitons at the donor/acceptor interface are separated into electrons in the acceptor material and holes in the donor material (i.e., charge separation) if the energy gap at the interface is sufficient to overcome the Coulomb attraction. However, those excitons that do not reach the interface simply decay to the ground state with the lifetime of a singlet exciton. (4) The separated electrons and holes may recombine at the interfaces (i.e., charge recombination) or transport to each electrode to generate a photocurrent (i.e., charge collection). Understanding the above photoexcited charge dynamics in OIHSCs is crucial in order to further improve the conversion efficiency, since the interfacial charge photogeneration, separation and recombination processes govern the photovoltaic performance.23 However, there are few reports on the photoexcited charge dynamics of OIHSCs compared to OPVs, especially those prepared using the one-pot preparation method.
To date, there have been several reports about the effects of dyes as interfacial modifiers in OIHSCs on their optical absorption, charge separation, morphology, transport and photovoltaic properties.24–29 Nelson and coworkers24 studied the influence of an amphiphilic ruthenium-based dye applied at TiO2 nanorods/P3HT heterojunction interfaces. They found that charge-separation yield at the polymer–nanocrystal interface could be improved by introducing the dye at the interface, although photocurrents were not improved by the dye because of the poor charge transport in the TiO2–P3HT blend films.24 Watkins and coworkers25 studied hydrogen bond interactions between N3-dye adsorbed at the interface of TiO2 nanorods and functionalized P3HT to control morphology and nanorod dispersion, increase interfacial area, and improve efficiency in TiO2–P3HT BHJ solar cells. Chen and coworkers26 showed that charge recombination at P3HT/TiO2 nanorod interfaces could be suppressed by the attachment of effective ligand molecules consisting of carboxylate groups –COOH such as anthracene-9-carboxylic acid (ACA), tetracarboxy phthalocyanine copper(II) (CuPc-dye) and cis-bis(4,4-dicarboxy-2,2-bipyridine)dithiocyanato ruthenium(II) (N3-dye). They found that bulky interface molecules such as N3-dye slowed down the recombination rate more effectively than a planar molecule such as ACA and CuPc-dye. McGehee and coworkers27 investigated the effects of interface modification in bilayer TiO2–P3HT OIHSCs by employing a series of para-substituted benzoic acids with varying dipoles and a series of multiply substituted benzene carboxylic acids. Their work showed that both molecular dipoles and acid-based interaction could cause a band edge shift in TiO2, resulting in a change in Voc. They also showed that external quantum efficiency (EQE) could be improved from 5% to 10–14% with Ru(II) dye modification, which was considered to result from the suppression of recombination kinetics at the interfaces but not from sensitization of the dyes. Friend and coworkers28 reported an improved photoinduced charge separation in bilayer ZnO–P3HT OIHSCs by modifying the interface with a self-assembled monolayer (SAM) of phenyl-C61-butyric acid (PCBA). An improved EQE from 3% to 9% and enhanced power conversion efficiency from 0.04% to 0.18% were achieved by the modification of the SAM of PCBA, which were attributed to improved exciton dissociation and reduced recombination losses. Ackermann and coworkers29 studied tetra(4-carboxyphenyl)porphyrin (TCPP)-modified ZnO nanorod–P3HT BHJ solar cells. They showed that interfacial modification led to additional photocurrent generation by dye absorption. Although the overall performance of the hybrid solar cells could not be improved because of increased back recombination rates of the P3HT radical cation as well as increased aggregation between ZnO nanorods, they illustrated that dye grafting on inorganic nanoparticles has the potential to increase the spectral response of hybrid BHJ solar cells. It is worth noting that all the dyes employed in the above studies contain carboxylic groups.
In this article, we use a transient absorption (TA) technique to clarify the charge separation and recombination dynamics from picoseconds to nanoseconds at the interfaces of P3HT–ZnO hybrid solar cells with and without a dye (SQ36) prepared using the one-pot method. We studied the effects of the dye on charge separation and recombination at the P3HT/ZnO BHJ interfaces. We found that the charge recombination can be hugely suppressed by locating the dye at the heterojunction interfaces. We hope the results presented here provide information and a methodology on how to improve the conversion efficiency of OIHSCs.
The details of the one-pot preparation method for P3HT–ZnO and P3HT–SQ36–ZnO solar cells have been published elsewhere.22 Diethyl zinc (DEZ)–polymer (P3HT) solutions were prepared by mixing 300 μl of DEZ (0.4 M solution in toluene–tetrahydrofuran) with 350 μl of the polymer in chlorobenzene (14.3 mg ml−1). Assuming full conversion of the DEZ to ZnO, a thin film with a 1:1 (w/w) ratio of ZnO/polymer is formed. For dye sensitized devices, SQ36 dye24 (7 wt% against P3HT) was mixed in 300 μl of DEZ (0.4 M solution in toluene–tetrahydrofuran) with 350 μl of P3HT (14 mg ml−1 in chlorobenzene solution). P3HT–ZnO and P3HT–SQ36–ZnO films (110 ± 10 nm) were prepared by spin coating solution onto 70 nm thick poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) (BAYTRON P, HC Starck, GMBH, Germany) on ITO substrates, followed by aging for 15 min at room temperature and annealing for 15 min at 100 °C. As shown in Fig. S2 in the ESI,† a suitable energy cascade between P3HT, SQ36 and ZnO was confirmed from their energy levels and thus effective photon harvesting from P3HT and SQ36 can be expected. The setup of the TA technique for measuring the charge dynamics has been reported in detail in a previous paper.31 In this study, the excitation wavelengths were chosen to be 520 nm and 680 nm for selective optical absorption of P3HT and SQ36, respectively (Fig. S3, ESI†).23,30 The probe wavelength was 775 nm, which can be used to monitor the radical cation of P3HT (P3HT+).23,32
First, for the TA measurements, we selectively excited the P3HT in the P3HT–ZnO film using an excitation wavelength of 520 nm to characterize the charge separation and recombination dynamics of P3HT–ZnO. Fig. 1 shows the TA signal of a P3HT–ZnO film on time scales of 35 ps (a) and 2000 ps (b), respectively. According to the TA decay of P3HT/PCBM reported by other researchers and also our own experimental results (Fig. S4, ESI†),32 we know that the TA signal of P3HT–ZnO measured under our experimental conditions (with an excitation light of 520 nm and a probe light of 775 nm) originates from optical absorption giving rise to the radical P3HT cation (P3HT+), i.e., the holes in P3HT. Thus the initial fast increase in the TA signal shown in Fig. 1(a) reflects the charge separation dynamics, i.e., electron injection from P3HT to ZnO and the simultaneous generation of P3HT+. As shown in Fig. 1(a), charge separation at the interfaces in the P3HT–ZnO film occurs within 1 ps. This means that the photogenerated excitons are formed close to the interfaces and charge separation can occur immediately following optical absorption without the need for diffusion of the excitons. For reference, Fig. S4(a) (ESI†) shows the initial dynamics of the TA signal for P3HT/PCBM, where the TA signal increases with a time constant of a few tens of ps. This result is in good agreement with the reported results.20 In this case, the increased time constant corresponds to the time required for excitons to diffuse to the interfaces for charge separation. The difference in the initial rise time in the TA signal can be considered to result from the difference in domain sizes in the different BHJ structures, especially in the organic phase. From TEM images of the P3HT–ZnO blend films with and without dye shown in Fig. S5 in ESI,† we found that the morphologies of the blend film were almost not changed by the introduction of dye. We also found that the P3HT (white dots in the TEM images) and ZnO (black dots in the TEM images) domains in the P3HT–ZnO films were as small as 10–20 nm, which thus had a larger interface area, making it beneficial for fast and efficient charge separation.

From Fig. 1(b), we can see that the TA signal decreases with time, which corresponds to charge recombination occurring between the electrons injected into ZnO and the holes in P3HT (i.e., the radical cation, P3HT+). We find that there are two processes in the TA decay and the TA signal can be fitted very well to a biexponential function as follows: Y = A1e−t/t1 + A2e−t/t2,(1)where t1 and t2 are the lifetimes and A1 and A2 are the contributions from the two components. The lifetimes t1 and t2 of the two charge recombination processes are 101 ± 8 ps (A1/(A1 + A2): 60%) and 4.7 ± 0.6 ns (A2/(A1 + A2): 40%), respectively. The former can be considered to correspond to the recombination of electrons injected into the ZnO conduction band with holes in P3HT (P3HT+), and the latter to the recombination of electrons trapped at ZnO surface states and holes in P3HT, as illustrated in Fig. 1(c). As shown in Fig. S4(b) (ESI†), charge recombination was not observed up to 1 ns in the case of P3HT/PCBM and it is well known that P3HT/PCBM OPVs show a higher conversion efficiency. Thus, the large charge recombination shown in Fig. 1(c) can be considered to be one of the main reasons for the lower efficiency (1%) of P3HT–ZnO OIHSCs made using the one-pot preparation method. One possible reason for the large charge recombination is the nano-morphology of the P3HT–ZnO film. As mentioned above, the domains were found to be as small as 10–20 nm from TEM images and thus the film has a larger interface area. Although this is beneficial for fast and efficient charge separation, it results in a faster charge recombination rate. This is because the electrons in the ZnO and the holes in the P3HT are very close to each other and the Coulomb attraction between them is large enough for direct recombination. Another possible reason for the high recombination rate is the ZnO surface states. As mentioned above in the sample preparation method, the temperature used in the one-pot preparation method for P3HT–ZnO is as low as 100 °C. Therefore, it would be reasonable to expect that some defects and ZnO surface states are present at the interface. As a result, electrons injected into the ZnO can be easily trapped at ZnO surface states and then recombine with holes in the P3HT. Therefore, control of the nano-morphology and the domain sizes as well as the reduction of ZnO surface states are crucial in order to improve the photocurrent and efficiency of one-pot prepared OIHSCs. In the following, we will demonstrate that the appropriate location of a dye at the BHJ interfaces is one method that can almost completely eradicate charge recombination.
We characterized the charge separation and recombination processes in the P3HT–SQ36–ZnO film. First, we selectively excited the P3HT with an excitation wavelength of 520 nm to see the effects of the dye on the charge separation and recombination dynamics in the visible region. Fig. 2 shows the TA signals of a P3HT–SQ36–ZnO film on the time scales of 35 ps (a) and 2000 ps (b), respectively. From Fig. 2(a), we can observe a rise in the TA signal within 10 ps, which can be well fitted with the following equation:19 y = A1(1 − e−t/tl)(2)where t1 is the time constant of the rising TA signal, and A1 is a constant. The time constant t1 was determined to be 3.3 ± 0.4 ps, corresponding to the charge separation time due to electron injection from the LUMO of P3HT to the LUMO of SQ36 and then to the ZnO conduction band. The charge separation time in P3HT–SQ36–ZnO is a little slower than that of P3HT–ZnO (less than 1 ps). The lengthening of the characteristic time for injection could also be accounted for changes in the microstructure of the sample because of the addition of dye.29 However, in our case there is not an observable change in the P3HT and ZnO domains after adding the dye as shown in the TEM images (Fig. S5, ESI†). Thus, it is reasonable that most of the dye (SQ36) can be considered to be located at the interfaces between P3HT and ZnO, resulting in two electron injection steps, as illustrated in Fig. 2(c). As shown in Fig. 2(b), the TA signal for P3HT–SQ36–ZnO decreases with time, which is due to the recombination between electrons injected into the ZnO and the holes in the P3HT. The TA signal shown in Fig. 2(b) can be fitted well with eqn (1) and the two decay processes can clearly be observed. The decay time of the faster process was determined to be 560 ± 70 ps (A1/(A1 + A2): 50%), and the decay time of the slower process was found to be very large (≫5 ns) (A2/(A1 + A2): 50%). Therefore, it can be reasonably considered that the TA signal for the second process shown in Fig. 2(b) has remained unchanged. From these results, we found that the dye in P3HT–SQ36–ZnO significantly suppressed the charge recombination compared to P3HT–ZnO. This result is consistent with the studies reported so far,24,26–28 although SQ36 has no carboxylic groups, which is different from those dyes used in the previous studies.24,26–28 Based on the fitting results, we consider that the faster charge recombination process is due to the direct recombination between electrons in the ZnO conduction band and holes in the P3HT, while the slower one is due to the recombination between electrons trapped at ZnO surface states and holes in the P3HT. Therefore, the dye molecules located at the BHJ interfaces have two effects on the charge recombination. The first effect is the reduction of ZnO surface states, which results in a huge reduction in recombination through electron trapping, and the second effect is the spatial separation of electrons in the ZnO and holes in the P3HT by locating the dye at the interfaces, which reduces the Coulomb attraction between the electrons and holes, resulting in a large increase in the charge recombination time constant (from 101 ps to 560 ps), as illustrated in Fig. 2(c). The charge separation and recombination times are summarized in Table 1.

Secondly, we selectively excited the SQ36 in the P3HT–SQ36–ZnO film with an excitation wavelength of 680 nm to clarify the charge separation and recombination dynamics in the near infrared (NIR) region due to optical absorption in the SQ36. Fig. 3 shows the TA signal on the time scales of 120 ps (a) and 1000 ps (b), respectively. From Fig. 3(a), we can see an initial increase of the TA signal and the corresponding time constant was determined to be 13 ps ± 0.7 ps by fitting Fig. 3(a) with eqn (2). This initial increase in the TA signal corresponds to the generation of P3HT+, i.e., hole transfer from the photoexcited SQ36 to P3HT. This result indicates the sensitization of SQ36. Thus the dye has the potential to increase the spectral response of the BHJ solar cells.22,29 From the fitting results, we know that charge separation occurred within a time scale of 10 ps for SQ36. From Fig. 3(b), we can see that the TA signal is almost unchanged up to 1000 ps, which is quite different from those shown in Fig. 1(b) and 2(b). The result of Fig. 3(b) indicates that there is almost no charge recombination between electrons injected into the ZnO from the SQ36 and the holes transferred from the SQ36 to the P3HT in this case. Comparing the difference in the charge recombination dynamics in P3HT–SQ36–ZnO by selectively exciting P3HT and SQ36, as shown in Fig. 2(b) and 3(b), respectively, we found that: (1) the charge recombination that occurred in the case of selectively exciting P3HT (Fig. 2(b)) can be considered to originate from interfaces where there was no SQ36; (2) if a uniform layer of dye, such as SQ36, can be formed at all the interfaces, the charge recombination can be completely suppressed. Although the charge separation time became a little larger (10 ps) due to dye compared to that of P3HT–ZnO BHJs without dye (<1 ps), it is much smaller compared to the recombination time (≫1 ns). So the influence of the increase of charge separation time could be neglected. Thus the introduction of dye at the P3HT/ZnO interfaces suppressed the charge recombination but maintained the faster charge separation.

(c) A schematic illustration of the charge separation and recombination dynamics in P3HT–SQ36–ZnO for NIR light absorption by SQ36. 
In summary, we have clarified the charge separation and recombination dynamics in one-pot prepared P3HT–ZnO and P3HT–dye (SQ36)–ZnO OIHSCs using the TA technique, both for optical absorption of P3HT in the visible region and for optical absorption of SQ36 in the NIR region. We found that charge separation occurred within 1 ps and that there was significant charge recombination due to ZnO surface states and/or the Coulomb attraction between electrons in ZnO and holes in P3HT in the case of P3HT–ZnO. This may be due to the small domain sizes and large interface area in the P3HT–ZnO structures studied in this paper. In the case of P3HT–SQ36–ZnO, charge separation occurred over time scales of 3–4 ps (for the visible light absorption) or 10 ps (for the NIR light absorption), while charge recombination was greatly reduced by locating the dye at the interfaces. We hope that our findings provide one methodology for the design of OIHSCs for improving their conversion efficiency, which is to position the dye at the appropriate BHJ interfaces. Systematic studies on the effect of the nano-morphology of P3HT–ZnO and the conditions used when a dye is included (including the weight ratio and the type of dye) on the charge separation and recombination processes as well as the photovoltaic properties of OIHSCs are now in progress and will be published elsewhere.
