    , Accepted 5th May 2019First published on 6th May 2019AbstractThe thermal and moisture instabilities of pure organic lead halide perovskites are the foremost concerns towards the commercialization of perovskite solar cells, which can be avoided by introducing an inorganic cation, such as cesium ion (Cs+) at the A-site of the perovskite crystals. In this report, the impacts of substituted Cs+ cations on the inherent properties such as microstructures, morphology, and photophysics of pure methylammonium lead bromide (MAPbBr3) perovskites have been investigated. Successful formation of mixed MA1−xCsxPbBr3 phases (with 0 ≤ x ≤ 1.0) was predicted from the theoretically calculated tolerance factor, which was further supported by the appearance of sharp diffraction peaks in X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns without any additional peaks in the whole composition range. Substitution of Cs+ ions brings significant lattice contraction in the parent MAPbBr3 crystal due to the ion size disparity in the ionic radii between MA+ and Cs+ ions. We examine the vibrational signatures of the Raman bands related to the organic MA+ and infer the nature of interactions between the organic moiety and the surrounding inorganic cage as a function of Cs concentration. Raman spectroscopic analysis reveals structural distortion due to the altered H-bonding interaction of the N+–H⋯Br− type between MA+ and the PbBr3− octahedral framework as a function of Cs content, which is responsible for the octahedral tilting in Cs substituted MAPbBr3. We also found hindered rotational motions of MA+ in the octahedral cage of mixed cationic systems, resulting in the orientational ordering of MA in the presence of Cs. These results certainly offer highly ordered mixed phase structures and promote superior thermal stability, as evident from the thermogravimetric analysis. The photoluminescence intensity becomes considerably enhanced at increased substitution levels, which highlights the capability of incorporated Cs+ cations in suppressing non-radiative recombination in a pure MA-based crystal, possibly related to the mitigation of trapping. The substitution of Cs+ with MAPbBr3 allows innovative strategies to improve the proficiency of tandem solar cells by modifying their structural and photophysical properties.
1. Introduction
Three-dimensional perovskite materials with the chemical composition of ABX3 have potential to grow rapidly in the field of solar cells. Broadly, these novel materials have been classified based on the presence of A-site monovalent cations either organic [e.g., methylammonium (MA or CH3NH3+) or formamidinium (FA or CH(NH2)2+)] or inorganic (e.g., Cs+ or Rb+) ions; divalent B-site cations (e.g., Pb2+ or Sn2+) along with the halide anions (e.g., I− or Br− or Cl−).1 Hybrid organic–inorganic halide perovskites with the MAPbX3 structure have been developed as an alternative of semiconductor materials in the field of light-emitting diodes, photodetectors, lasers, electrochemical cells, field-effect transistors, photovoltaics and associated optoelectronic devices. This is certainly due to their excellent intrinsic properties such as strong light absorption coefficient, solution processing, extended diffusion length, low exciton binding energy, high mobility of the inorganic framework, and tunable band gap energy.2–4 Among all probable structures, Miyasaka and co-workers utilized MAPbI3 and MAPbBr3 perovskites for the first time in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) as light harvesters.5 Later on, substantial development was achieved by the implementation of solid-state perovskite solar cells (PSCs) using MAPbI3.6 In the past few years, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs has been improved from 3.81% to 22.1%.5,7 However, the efficient PSCs based on FAPbI3 and MAPbI3 suffer from the essential long-term stability under operational circumstances. This is the foremost difficulty for this perovskite technology to extend their commercialization. On the other hand, stable all-inorganic CsPbI3-based solar cells displayed inadequate PCEs of <2.9% due to their non-ideal band gaps (>1.7 eV).8 Presently, the utmost challenging concerns are the thermal stability and light soaking efficiency, which mostly affect the performance of PSCs according to our assessments, since it is difficult to control the rise in temperature as well as continuous illumination of light during their operation.
In order to develop the phase stability and reduce the degradation of materials, substitution of the A-site cations and/or X-site anions is the utmost proposition in PSCs, which can be termed alloying or chemical compositional engineering.9–11 Very recently, it has been proposed that perovskite materials with mixed cations and halides have advantages over conventional halide perovskites in terms of their enhanced stability, higher performance, increased charge carrier transport, tunable band-gap, and lack of prominent hysteresis.8 Earlier, Choi et al.12 and Niu et al.13 optimized devices with mixed CsxMA1−xPbI3 systems at x = 0.1 and 0.09, respectively, in which they found ∼20% and ∼15% of enhancement in PCE, respectively, in comparison with the specific MAPbI3-based reference cells. A successful fabrication of efficient planar heterojunction PSCs was achieved in terms of the improved PCE value from 14.9% to 16.5% by employing mixed FA0.9Cs0.1PbI3 perovskites with the fractional replacement of FA+ by Cs+.14 Thus, the improved structural, thermal, and moisture stabilities of perovskites along with the utmost performance efficiencies of PSCs were perceived when the A-site MA or FA cations were substituted with Cs at specific compositions.9,15–18
However, much of the attention is focused on the devices based on the pure MAPbI3 or mixed halide perovskites, such as MAPbI3−xClx and MAPbI3−xBrx with a band-gap of ∼1.6 eV, despite the first reported photovoltaic device based on the MAPbBr3 perovskites.5 The benefit of high band gap Br-based perovskite materials makes them a promising candidate for potential use in tandem and multijunction solar cells,19,20 and for photo-electrochemistry to produce chemicals for energy storage by carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction and water splitting.21 Nonetheless, there is still a lack of understanding on the microstructures, optical properties and thermal stabilities of MAPbBr3 nanocrystals with the gradual mixing of Cs+, though few publications appeared recently on the Cs substituted MAPbI3 system.22–24 In fact, it is important to mention here that the mixed perovskites with (MA/Cs)PbBr3 compositions are still not explored in comparison with the other possible mixed A-cation halide perovskites according to a recent survey by Ono et al.8
In order to start filling this gap and identify the importance of Cs substituted MAPbBr3 for future tandem solar cells,25 herein, systematic investigations were carried out based on the synthesis and characterization of the several mixed MA1−xCsxPbBr3 systems (where, x = 0 → 1.0) by paying particular attention to the control of the effective cation composition for the first time. In this respect, we performed Raman spectroscopic measurements particularly focused on the low-frequency region along with the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern in order to reveal the structural evolution of the Cs substituted hybrid MAPbBr3 perovskites. The photophysical and morphological modifications were also correlated with the microstructures and thermal stability of the mixed perovskite systems. The compositional engineering strategy has been hardly explored for this particular mixed A-site bromide perovskite, and further exploration of its properties is likely to guide the photovoltaic community for improvement in the performance of the tandem and multijunction solar cell technology.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Materials
Cesium bromide (CsBr, 99.99%), lead bromide (PbBr2, 99.99%), methylammonium bromide (CH3NH3Br or MABr, 98%), oleic acid (OA, 99%) and oleylamine (OAm, 98%) were purchased from Aldrich. Solvents such as N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), toluene and cyclohexane were purchased from SDFCL, Chemicals with HPLC & Spectroscopic Grade. All the chemicals were used without further purification.
2.2. Synthesis protocol
Pure CsPbBr3 and MAPbBr3 perovskites along with the mixed A-cation (herein, MA+–Cs+) based perovskites (MA1−xCsxPbBr3; x = 0.2, 0.4, 0.6 and 0.8) were synthesized by the ligand-assisted reprecipitation (LARP) method at room temperature. In the typical synthesis protocol, two precursors such as A′Br or A′′Br (A′ and A′′ = MA and/or Cs with an appropriate mole ratio), PbBr2, OA and OAm were dissolved in 5 ml of DMF, which was added dropwise in 25 ml of toluene under vigorous stirring. Then, the colloidal solution was centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 10 minutes. The precipitated perovskite particles were collected and washed with cyclohexane three times to remove any unreacted solvents and ligands. The dropcast perovskite solution was dried at room temperature and finally the solid nanocrystals were collected. To control the effective Cs cation substitution in MAPbBr3 perovskites, the amount of ligands (OA and OAm), and solvents (toluene or cyclohexane) and concentrations of precursors (CsBr, PbBr2, and CH3NH3Br) in DMF along with the purification process were kept constant during the synthesis of both pure and mixed A-site cation perovskites. For MAPbBr3, MA0.8Cs0.2PbBr3, MA0.6Cs0.4PbBr3, MA0.4Cs0.6PbBr3, MA0.2Cs0.8PbBr3 and CsPbBr3 perovskites, the concentration ratio of mixed A cation precursors (i.e., MABr:CsBr) was taken as 0.16:0, 0.128:0.032, 0.096:0.064, 0.064:0.096, 0.032:0.128 and 0:0.16, respectively (in mmol). For all precursor solutions, the amount of added PbBr2, OA and OAm was 0.2 mmol, 0.5 ml and 50 μl, respectively. A portrait of the sample appearances is demonstrated in Fig. S1 (ESI†). As can be comprehended, the MAPbBr3 sample (from the left) appears typical orange in color, whereas mixed Cs substituted MA1−xCsxPbBr3 samples are yellowish in color. This observation visually implies that the prepared samples represent a progressive variation in the chemical composition.
2.3. Characterization techniques
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the synthesized perovskites were recorded in a PANalytical EMPYREAN X-ray diffractometer using Cu Kα-radiation (λ = 1.54060 Å, 30 mA, 45 kV) at room temperature. TA Instrument, Model Q50 was used to carry out the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of the synthesized perovskites. For TGA measurement, 10 mg of perovskite samples was utilized in the presence of a N2 atmosphere with a flow rate of 20 mL min−1 and a heating rate of 5° C min−1 by scanning from 30° to 600 °C. Raman measurement of the perovskite samples was performed using a Renishaw InVia Raman spectrometer with a Leica upright microscope using a 632.8 nm (He–Ne laser) laser excitation wavelength and a 1200 grooves per mm grating spectrometer at room temperature. A silicon standard (520.5 cm−1) was used as a reference to calibrate the Raman instrument before measurements. A UV-Vis near-IR spectrophotometer (UV-2600, Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto, Japan) was used to record the absorption spectrum of the perovskite solutions dispersed in cyclohexane. A FluoroMax-4 spectrofluorometer (Horiba Jobin Yvon Inc.) with a 5 nm slit width was used to record the photoluminescence (PL) spectrum of the colloidal solutions with an excitation wavelength of 450 nm. A field emission scanning electron microscope (ULTRA 55, FESEM, Carl Zeiss) and a JEOL JEM-2100F transmission electron microscope (TEM) with an accelerating voltage of 5 kV and 200 kV, respectively, were utilized to determine the morphology and particle distributions of the synthesized perovskite samples. High-resolution (HR) TEM, selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern analysis and particle size distribution were performed with the help of Digital Micrograph and ImageJ software. The time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) method was implemented during the fluorescence lifetime measurements using the FluoroCube (Horiba Jobin Yvon, formerly IBH product) with a 375 nm LED excitation source. The TBX-04 picosecond photon-detection module was used to detect the fluorescence signal. The DAS 6 decay analysis software package (HORIBA Jobin Yvon IBH) was used to analyze the fluorescence decay, where the best decay curve fit was achieved by monitoring the reduced χ2 values and the weighted residuals.
3. Results and discussion
The ionic size and interaction of the A cation with the corner-sharing BX6 octahedra directly contribute to the crystal structure of ABX3-based perovskite materials, which can be predicted from the hypothetical parameters, such as the Goldschmidt tolerance factor (t) and the octahedral factor (μ).26,27 However, these quantities offer only a rough estimate and cannot be taken as the benchmark for the material stability. The ideas of these theoretical parameters (t and μ) for hybrid perovskites are nothing but dimensionless numbers, which can be calculated from the ionic radii of the metals without considering their crystal symmetry by the following equations: (1) reffective = xrA+ + (1 − x)rB+(2) (3)
Herein, rA+ and rB+ are the ionic radii of A and B cations, respectively, whereas rX− is the ionic radii of the X anion. For mixed phase AxA′1−xBX3 perovskites, rA+ and t can be replaced by the effective ionic radii of mixed cations (reffective) and the effective tolerance factor (teffective), respectively, for two different A cations.9 It was suggested earlier that for a stable cubic structure of halide perovskites, the numerical values of t and μ should be in the ranges from 0.813 to 1.107 and 0.442 to 0.895, respectively.27 Considering the radii of MA+ = 180 pm, Cs+ = 167 pm, Pb2+ = 98 pm, and Br− = 196 pm,28–30 the teffective parameter is calculated for all MA1−xCsxPbBr3 (0 ≤ x ≥ 1) compositions and shown in Fig. S2A (ESI†), which falls in the range of 0.99–0.87. On the other hand, the μ factor is found to be 0.5, which is obviously unaffected as it is not reliant on the A-site cation. Thus, the values for these calculated parameters in this report fall within the specified range,27,31 and henceforth provide an indication that mixed MA-Cs perovskites can be generated. Therefore, substituting the A-site cation by an ion with a smaller ionic radius (herein, Cs+) should be a sensible approach to expand the structural tunability of the MAPbBr3 perovskites by contracting their crystal lattice. However, diminutive attention was paid to the decisive role of this structural regulation scheme in the stability, microstructure, and photophysical properties of the MAPbBr3 perovskites, and it is anticipated to improve the operative approaches by inspecting these concerns.
In this work, an approach is proposed for structural regulation in the MAPbBr3 lattice by the introduction of Cs, and the substitution effect is systematically investigated experimentally. The calculated teffective and μ values reveal the possibility of successful Cs insertion into the structural lattice of MAPbBr3, which induced the contraction of the corner-sharing PbBr6 octahedra and subsequently improved the geometric symmetry of the MAPbBr3 structure. The lattice volume of MA1−xCsxPbBr3 (0 ≤ x ≤ 1) shrinks with Cs+ substitution, as evident from Fig. S2B (ESI†), which implies the lattice strain or chemical pressure effect, related to the reduction of the internal structure by the ion size disparity between MA+ and Cs+.28 Such impacts can also be adjusted by mixing the different sized A-cations at controlled proportions due to the soft mechanical nature of the hybrid perovskites, which shows a noticeable effect on the phase transitions and optoelectronic properties.32,33 Table S1 (ESI†) reveals the contraction of a and b lattice parameters along with the elongation of the c lattice parameter, which further increases the c/a ratio with the gradual addition of Cs in the MAPbBr3 crystal (vide Fig. S2B†). As a result of the mixing of A-site cations, both the symmetry-breaking distortion and anisotropic volume contraction is noticed in the mixed MA1−xCsxPbBr3 lattice, which could be due to the contracted internal volume of the PbBr6 octahedra with shorter Pb–Br bonds and/or the octahedral tilting of corner-sharing PbBr6. Very recently, Ghosh et al.28 noticed stronger H-bonding interactions between the FA cation and the iodide ion along with the octahedral tilting and delayed rotational motion of the FA cation in the FAPbI3 perovskite as a function of Cs+ content using the ab initio simulations. Herein, in order to identify the structural distortion in the MA1−xCsxPbBr3 lattice, H-bonding interactions between MA and bromide ions (i.e., N–H⋯Br type), the effect of Cs substitution on the rotational motion of MA+, and the microstructures of mixed A-site perovskite systems were investigated using the combination of XRD and Raman spectroscopic techniques.
To confirm whether the MA1−xCsxPbBr3 (0 ≤ x ≤ 1) perovskites were perfectly blended or not, the PXRD patterns were evaluated with various MA/Cs ratios, as shown in Fig. 1A. The PXRD patterns of the MAPbBr3 nanocrystals showed diffraction peaks at 15.01°, 21.13°, 26.05°, 30.08°, 33.79°, 37.09°, 43.07°, and 45.90° corresponding to the interplanar spacings of (100), (110), (111), (200), (210), (211), (220), and (300) crystal planes, respectively, and complemented well with the earlier reports.19,34,35 The diffraction peaks belong to the crystallized orthorhombic MAPbBr3 crystal in a Pnma space group.29 The detailed PXRD measurement was also conducted for the mixed compositions to investigate the effect of the simultaneous intercalation of Cs cations into the MAPbBr3 nanocrystals. The XRD patterns of the MA-rich mixed phase of MA1−xCsxPbBr3 at x = 0.2 and 0.4 occupy the Pnma space group similar to MAPbBr3, whereas the Cs-rich nanocrystals at x = 0.6 and 0.8 occupy the Pbnm space group similar to orthorhombic CsPbBr3.36–38 This transformation of the space group between Pbnm and Pnma was also noticed earlier by simple readjustment of the crystallographic axes.39 The high quality crystalline structure of these perovskites can be identified from the sharp diffraction peaks in the XRD patterns. We believe that the change in the stoichiometry after the addition of Cs does not affect the crystal phase due to the slight shift in the peak positions without the appearance of the additional diffraction peaks, which confirms the orthorhombic crystal phases of mixed perovskites at all Cs concentrations. The strong diffraction peak from the (100) plane of all synthesized materials was ascribed to the superior crystal alignment along this plane. However, structural perturbations were perceived for the diffraction peaks at 15.01° (Fig. 2A), 21.13° (Fig. 2B), and 30.08° (Fig. 2C), in which the diffraction angle increases with the gradual substitution of Cs in the mixed phase compared to the MAPbBr3 crystals. The observed peak shifts are not from the experimental error, as the measurement system guarantees the error range of 2θ ≤ ±0.01°. The gradual shift in the diffraction angle without the appearance of two separate peaks of variable intensities strongly indicates the successful formation of the mixed MA1−xCsxPbBr3 phase in which the two cations are introduced into the identical lattice structure.40,41 This observation is consistent with the lattice contraction triggered by the substitution of MA+ with Cs+, shown in Table S1 (ESI†). As for example, the lattice parameters for MAPbBr3 (x = 0) are calculated to be a = 8.4933 Å, b = 12.011 Å, and c = 8.5364 Å resulting in a unit cell volume of 870.8253 Å3, which is comparable to the reported value by Poglitsch and Weber.42 For the mixed perovskite sample at x = 0.40, the peaks move to higher angle considerably, in which the lattice parameters are found to be a = 8.4399 Å, b = 11.8878 Å, and c = 8.3121 Å with a unit cell volume of 833.9816 Å3. In general, the specific 2θ ranges are enhanced with Cs+ substitution, which showed the extent of octahedral tilting.16,43 Moreover, the deviation of diffraction peaks from sharp to broadening is clearly noticed depending on the size of the nanocrystals. An increase in the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the diffraction peaks is noticed with the gradual substitution of the Cs (Fig. 2D), which indicates the reduction in the crystal domain sizes.12 Moreover, the strong and sharp diffraction peaks along the (100) and (200) crystalline planes for the mixed MA1−xCsxPbBr3 perovskite phases suggest a nano-platelet morphology of crystals rather than the spherical structure, which is in agreement with the previous report.44 The enhanced relative intensity of the (110) diffraction peak suggests a decrease in the thickness of the MAPbBr3 nanocrystals after the incorporation of Cs to form thinner nanocrystals.45 Furthermore, the altered interaction of the organic cation with the halide ion after A-site substitution is detected by employing the Raman spectroscopic technique and discussed in the following section.

Herein, Fig. 3A and B show the Raman spectra of MAPbBr3 crystals covering a wavenumber range of 90–3500 cm−1 after background subtraction with a 633 nm laser excitation source with a low laser power density in order to avoid the thermal effects on the spectrum. The Raman spectra in the low frequency region are categorized by two vibrational signatures, one which appears on the higher wavenumber side (270–400 cm−1) and the other one with a more broader contribution in the lower wavenumber region of 90–250 cm−1 (shown in the inset of Fig. 3A). The Raman signatures in the 900–3500 cm−1 region are mainly dominated by the vibrational modes of the organic cation (MA+) in the MAPbBr3 crystal, where the experimental frequencies show excellent agreement with the reported literature.46 The low frequency band on the higher energy sides (90–250 cm−1) in Fig. 4A is mainly associated with the translational and librational motions of MA+ in the unit cell along with the modes of the PbBr6 octahedral cage.22,47 It can be comprehended from Fig. 4A that Cs incorporation promotes the appearance of noticeable vibrational modes in the 90–250 cm−1 region in the MAPbBr3 system. Usually, a deficiency in the rigidity and vast disorder in the crystal structures of the octahedral cage are achieved due to the presence of anharmonic motion of MA cations, which can be subdued by the addition of Cs ions, and subsequently brought long-range ordering in the crystal structure. It seems that substitution with a minute amount of Cs is satisfactory to diminish the anharmonic motion of the MA ions, which leads to the strong coupling between Pb–Br and MA+ and ultimately lifts the Raman active modes.22 As there are many vibrations in a relatively narrow wavenumber range of 90–250 cm−1 based on the theoretical predictions, a precise analysis is impossible with the overlapping of lattice modes experimentally, which led to a smaller number of external modes than that expected theoretically. The individual peak positions obtained from the simultaneous fitting of Raman bands with Gaussians are summarized in Fig. S3A and S3B (ESI†) according to the reported methodology.48,49 The individual fitted peak positions can be assigned according to the literature for the pure MAPbBr3 crystal,47 which is represented in Fig. S3C and S3D† along with the FWHM of the deconvoluted modes as a function of the substituted Cs content. The bands in the lower wavenumber regions are made up by four overlapping contributions (∼107, 124, 147, and 176 cm−1) with the corresponding FWHM of ∼18, 30, 47, and 69 cm−1, respectively (vide Fig. S3E†), which are modified substantially by Cs substitution.

 Fig. 4  (A, B) Raman spectra acquired with the excitation at 633 nm in the low-frequency range of MA1−xCsxPbBr3 (0 ≤ x ≤ 1) perovskites as a function of chemical composition. 
On the other hand, the low frequency band on the lower energy side is dominated by the peak at ∼325 cm−1 with a FWHM of ∼37 cm−1 (Fig. 4B), which can be assigned as the torsional mode of the MA cation.47,50 The motion of the organic cation around the cage is directly related to the torsional mode, which is likely to be an indicator of the orientational ordering of the MA+ in these materials.51 According to a recent theoretical study,51 the compositional engineering of the A-site cation strongly affects the N+–H⋯X type of interaction between the organic cation and the octahedral cage along with the molecular distortion and dipolar orientational organization of the organic cation in the mixed perovskite, which results in significant modifications in the MA torsional modes. It can be manifested from Fig. 4B that the substitution with Cs as low as x = 0.2 in MA1−xCsxPbBr3 considerably shifts the torsional mode towards the lower wavenumber region. Quarti et al.51 suggested earlier that two opposing effects mainly govern the shift in the MA torsional modes of perovskite crystals. The foundation of particular H-bonding interaction and deformation of the MA molecules act in opposite ways, which results in the movement of the torsional mode toward the higher and lower frequencies, respectively. Thus, the MA cations in the presence of Cs+ are subjected to a diverse balance between the H-bonding interaction and molecular deformation, which spread their torsional frequency range over significant numbers. Also, it is sensible to presume that material morphology that brings the orientational ordering of the cations can directly affect the torsional mode.51 Finally, it has been observed that the intensity of the MA+ torsional mode was increased with the Cs+ substitution in the MAPbBr3 crystal along with the reduction in the line-width (videFig. 4B and 6B). An increase in the long-range order and crystallinity along with the microstructural homogeneities due to an ordered distribution of bromide ions in the perovskite crystals usually yield narrower peaks.47
The Raman spectra illustrated in Fig. 5A–C demonstrate that a large number of MA vibrational modes exhibit substantial alteration in the peak characteristics (e.g., shifts, widths, and intensities) with Cs substitution in MAPbBr3. Typical internal vibrational modes of MA+ that appeared in the fingerprint frequency range, just below 1000 cm−1 (i.e., C–N stretching), at 1400–1600 cm−1 (i.e., NH3 bending and twisting) and at ∼3000 cm−1 (i.e., CH3 and NH3 stretching) are well explored for the MAPbX3 perovskites.46,47 In these fingerprint regions, the most interesting vibrational mode is the rocking vibration of the MA cation around the C–N axis appearing in the range of 910–925 cm−1,47 the dynamics of which will be discussed in the subsequent section. The peaks correspond to the asymmetric NH3+ bending and the twisting modes of MA+ (i.e. at ∼1475 and 1590 cm−1, respectively) shift to the lower frequencies with increasing Cs content in MAPbBr3,34,52 as represented in Fig. 5B and C. Importantly, as the smaller Cs cation is inserted into the A-site of the MAPbBr3 lattice, the red-shifted peaks are observed due to the alteration in electrostatic as well as chemical associations between the MA cation with the surrounding PbBr6 cage, analogous to the report of Xie et al.52 These changes in the vibrational modes clearly specify an enhancement in the strength and number of the intermolecular H-bonds of N–H⋯Br types in mixed MA1−xCsxPbBr3 perovskites compared to the unalloyed MAPbBr3 crystal.46 Moreover, addition of the Cs ion into the MAPbBr3 lattice brings the H-atoms of the MA cation nearer to the bromide ions of the inorganic cage due to the increased cage tilting, which locked the octahedral rocking motion of the MA cation (refer to the subsequent paragraph) and subsequently reduced the fluctuation in the H-bonding. These features are expected to offer an increase in the phase stability of the perovskites with mixed A-site cations.53 Additionally, in higher frequency regions, no distinct MA mode shifting is demonstrated with the increase in the Cs substitution, as shown in Fig. S4A and S4B (ESI†). An analogous outcome was stated earlier for other perovskite systems,54,55 inferring that the deformation in the crystal structures did not influence the vibrational modes in the high frequency regions considerably for the MA units.47

Herein, we have used the FWHM value of a particular vibrational mode related to the orientational ordering of the MA cation for the estimation of the correlation time (τc) using the following equation:47 τc = 1/2πcFWHM.(4)
The results indicate that the width of the rocking mode of the MA cation at 920 cm−1 decreases from 25 cm−1 in MAPbBr3 to about 18 cm−1 in MA0.2Cs0.8PbBr3 perovskites and the corresponding correlation time for this vibration increases from 0.21 ps to 0.28 ps (videFig. 6A), which suggests dipolar ordering of MA in mixed A-site cation perovskites.47 We have also calculated the correlation time for the torsional mode of the MA cation for all perovskite derivatives, which also shows a similar trend in the FWHM and τc values with the Cs substitution in MAPbBr3 (Fig. 6B). In general, a low FWHM of the rocking mode is expected for a highly ordered structure such as the Pb–Br cage,49 which is identified for mixed Cs substituted MAPbBr3 perovskites.

In order to measure the shape and size of the pure and mixed phase perovskite nanocrystals, TEM measurements have been carried out and subsequently exemplified in Fig. 7A–F. It is clearly evident from the representative figures that the synthesized materials display well-defined square shaped nanostructures with uniform and monodisperse character, which can be ascribed as the ‘nanocubes’. However, the particle size distributions suggest relatively smaller particle sizes of Cs substituted MAPbBr3 nanocrystals, as depicted in Fig. S5 (ESI†). It was observed earlier that the nature of the A-site cation affects the film morphology of the mixed phase (CH3NH3)1−2x(H3NC2H4NH3)xPbI3 (where x = 0 and 0.1),56 and (FAPbI3)1−x(MAPbBr3)x (where x = 0 to 0.15) perovskites.11 However, the average sizes of the nanocubes for CsPbBr3 and mixed MA1−xCsxPbBr3 perovskites are found in the range of 15–17 nm. On the other hand, the pure MAPbBr3 perovskite produces larger size crystallites (∼60 nm), which can be correlated with the narrow diffraction peaks in the XRD measurements and in close agreement with the literature value.41 Furthermore, HRTEM was employed to dictate the spacings in the crystal lattice of these materials, as shown in the upper left inset of Fig. 7A–F. Clear lattice fringes from HRTEM images were noticed in all compositions, which infer good crystallinity in these materials. The lattice spacings in the nanocrystals decrease from 0.60 to 0.29 Å with increasing Cs concentration in the pure MAPbBr3 phase. This also indicates that the MA+ ions become partially substituted with Cs+ due to the smaller ionic radius of Cs compared to MA, which subsequently leads to lattice contraction in the mixed phase. The high crystallinity of the synthesized mixed perovskite systems was also confirmed from the selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns (vide Fig. S6, ESI†). Furthermore, the size and morphology of the as-prepared nanocrystals were investigated by the FESEM measurement (depicted in Fig. 8A–F), which demonstrate the morphology evolution of the CsPbBr3 system with the increase in the MA concentration. As the content of MA is increased in the mixed MA1−xCsxPbBr3 system, the small nanocubes began to self-assemble to form extended nanocubes, while they gradually disappeared in pure MAPbBr3 (videFig. 8A). In view of these, we assume that the extended nanocubes in MAPbBr3 and MA-rich MA0.8Cs0.2PbBr3 prevailed through the oriented attachment of small nanocubes. The extended nanocubes having few trap states might reduce the PL intensity considerably in MA-rich systems (Fig. S7A, ESI†), which will be discussed in the subsequent section. A similar kind of morphological evolution was noticed earlier by Tong et al. for CsPbBr3 perovskites.57

The photophysical properties of the MAPbBr3 nanocrystals were evaluated using absorption and steady-state photoluminescence (PL) measurements with the gradual addition of Cs+ and the corresponding results are exemplified in Fig. 9A and B. The blue-shifted absorption edge in the absorption spectra of the MAPbBr3 nanocrystals with increasing Cs+ concentration can be attributed to the well-known quantum confinement effect.58,59 However, the lattice contraction of the MAPbBr3 nanocrystals with Cs+ substitution has a direct influence on the absorption peak, which shifts to the higher energy side.60 From the PL study, it is witnessed that the emission maxima (λemmax) of the MAPbBr3 nanocrystals can be adjusted in the range of 515–535 nm with a steady blue-shift upon Cs+ substitution (videFig. 9B). The octahedral distortion triggered by the small sized Cs+ compared to MA+ and the influence of superior quantum confinement prompted by the MABr and Cs+ are the main contributing factors for higher energy emission in mixed MA1−xCsxPbBr3 systems compared to the pure MAPbBr3.60,61 In contrast, an unfamiliar red shift is noticed on going from MA0.8Cs0.2PbBr3 to MA0.4Cs0.2PbBr3 systems in Fig. 9B, which might be ascribed to the balance between the quantum confinement and electron–phonon coupling effects in the presence of lattice contraction and exciton self-trapping, respectively. The electron–phonon coupling typically results in a red-shift, whereas the quantum confinement effect results in a blue-shift.

Remarkably, the PL intensity is found to be improved with gradual substitution with Cs+ in MAPbBr3 nanocrystals, as shown in Fig. S7A.† This may initiate from the selective removal of undesired surface defects and subsequent efficiency in radiative recombination of MAPbBr3 nanocrystals with the inclusion of Cs+.60,62 Meanwhile, the small Stokes shift between the PL and absorption peaks in Cs-rich perovskite compositions implies that the emission is initiated from direct excitonic recombination (vide Fig. S7B†).63 Furthermore, the broad and dual PL emission peaks in Fig. S7A† are observed in MA-rich compositions (MA1−xCsxPbBr3 with x = 0, 0.2 and 0.4), which was witnessed earlier for numerous perovskite systems.64–68 These typical PL profiles can be deconvoluted by the Gaussian curve fitting methodology with two peaks (vide Fig. S7C†) according to Yu et al.64 The high-energy narrow peak possibly arises from the excitonic emission, however the low-energy broad peak might be ascribed to the formation of self-trapped excitons (STEs).67,68 It is worth mentioning here that the PL with a larger FWHM was observed in MA-rich compositions (at x = 0, 0.2 and 0.4) compared to the other compositions (vide Fig. S7D†), which further confirms the presence of STE states.68 The PL peaks with a narrower FWHM in Cs-rich MAPbBr3 compared to the pure MAPbBr3 nanocrystals can be correlated with the reduction in defects, which induced a more ordered local environment and a decreased inhomogeneous line-width.60
In order to depict the excitonic recombination dynamics, the time-resolved PL spectra were acquired using the TCSPC technique for MA1−xCsxPbBr3 nanocrystals with an excitation wavelength of 375 nm. The corresponding decay plots for these nanocrystals are shown in Fig. 10A, which can be fitted using a bi-exponential decay model,23,59,60,69–71 (5)where Ai, t and τi are the relative amplitude of the component denoted in percentage, time, and the decay life-time, respectively. By considering the fitting results, the estimated life-times can be assigned to short-lived (radiative recombination) and long-lived (non-radiative recombination) life-times.72 For the present set of compositions, short (τ1) and long (τ2) life-times are observed in the range of 1.05–5.10 ns and 24.10–39.80 ns, respectively, as shown in Fig. 10B and Table S2 (ESI†). Similar life-time ranges were observed earlier for MAPbBr3 quantum dots and mixed cation–anion Cs0.05(MA0.17FA0.83)0.95Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3 perovskites.72 The average life-time of these nanocrystals can be measured from the following equation,70 and is summarized in Fig. 10B. (6)
 Fig. 10  (A) Time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) decay curves and (B) bi-exponential fitted lifetime values of the synthesized MA1−xCsxPbBr3 (0 ≤ x ≤ 1) perovskites. 
Direct band-to-band recombination including the exciton or free electron–hole recombination can be assigned as the short-lived radiative processes, whereas the long-lived non-radiative recombination occurred via exciton–exciton annihilation or by three-body Auger processes involving free charges in the presence of the trapped excitons or free carriers.66,73 In organic–inorganic hybrid MAPbBr3 nanocrystals, the average life-time is found to be higher compared to the all-inorganic CsPbBr3 (Fig. 10B), which can be explained from the sintering effect of the MAPbBr3 and the density of the surface defects of CsPbBr3.74 It is noticed from Fig. 10B that the long life-time component along with the average lifetime increase with the gradual Cs+ substitution in mixed MA0.8Cs0.2PbBr3 nanocrystals. This observation implies the reduction in defect states and partly eliminated non-radiative paths with the introduction of Cs+ ions into the MA0.8Cs0.2PbBr3 nanocrystals.60 It is interesting to mention here that the PL lifetimes are found to be higher in Cs-rich compositions (at x = 1, 0.8 and 0.6) compared to MA-rich compositions (at x = 0.2 and 0.4) in mixed MA1−xCsxPbBr3 phases. In general, the slower PL lifetime specifies the reduction in the non-radiative pathways. As a result of that, upon light absorption the generated excitons are more prone to recombine with the radiative pathways, which further lead to the enhancement in the PL intensity.59 However, the higher contribution of the slower PL lifetime component indicates that these perovskite nanocrystals are less prone to the surface defects or additional opposing non-radiative channels.66 The slower lifetime along with the red-shifted PL of the MAPbBr3 nanocrystals compared to the other mixed compositions entail the presence of inter-particle states that stimulate the extended-range of carrier mobility.35
Finally and most importantly, the stability of the mixed phase perovskites along with the pure phases was determined by the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) as a function of temperature, which is shown in Fig. 11A. The synthesized materials are found to be thermally stable up to 250 °C; analogous to the other kinds of inorganic as well as hybrid perovskites.38,75 The TGA data analysis of pure MAPbBr3 along with the MA-rich mixed MA1−xCsxPbBr3 perovskites (at x = 0.2, 0.4 and 0.6) shows two major weight loss peaks at ∼350 and ∼600 °C, which might be recognized as the loss of the organic ligands and the inorganic framework, respectively.76 In contrast to the MA-rich perovskites, the CsPbBr3 and Cs-rich MA0.2Cs0.8PbBr3 perovskites suffer very minor weight loss at ∼600 °C. The significant improvement in the thermal stability of the MAPbBr3 nanocrystals with Cs substitution in terms of the loss of the organic ligands can be clearly evident from the weight loss profile of the TGA first derivative plots (Fig. 11B). In order to verify the comparative thermal stability of the mixed phase MA1−xCsxPbBr3 perovskites with the reported two-dimensionally networked (2DN) ethylenediammonium lead bromide perovskite, it is demonstrated that there is a 10–20% weight loss at ∼300 °C for the mixed perovskites, whereas a 40% weight loss was observed for the reported 2DN perovskite material.77 Thus, tuning the “A” type cation from pure MA to mixed MA1−xCsx led to the stabilization of the mixed perovskite materials over the 2DN form of the perovskites with the ethylenediammonium cation.

4. Summary
In summary, we have profoundly explored the mixed MA1−xCsxPbBr3 systems (0 ≤ x ≤ 1) for the first time, unfolding their crystal structure, thermal stability, morphological and optical properties by using a combination of XRD, Raman, TGA and UV-PL techniques as a function of the Cs concentration. The collected experimental outcomes along with the theoretically calculated parameters endorse the successful formation of the mixed phase systems. By properly adjusting the amounts of MA and Cs, we obtained consistent proof of structural variations arising from the Cs substitution. The high quality crystalline structure of mixed perovskites was recognized from the sharp diffraction peaks in the XRD patterns. We believe that the change in the stoichiometry after the addition of Cs did not modify the crystal phase due to the slight shift in the peak positions without the appearance of the additional diffraction peaks, which confirmed the orthorhombic crystal phases of mixed perovskites at all Cs concentrations. The results from the Raman spectral analysis revealed a strong H-bonding interaction of the N+–H⋯Br type, where the organic CH3NH3+ counterpart interacts with the octahedral framework and that can be tuned by the gradual substitution with Cs+. Rocking and torsional modes further provided clear evidence on the progression of H-bonding interactions, which is responsible for the interplay in organic–inorganic counterparts for the mixed MA1−xCsxPbBr3 perovskite. For example, octahedral tilting and molecular deformation in MAPbBr3 with the gradual addition of Cs are found to be responsible to improve the N+–H⋯Br type of H-bonding interaction in the crystal lattice, which further prompted the orientational ordering of MA in mixed MA1−xCsxPbBr3 by restricting the motion of the MA+ in the cages. The photophysical properties showed more or less steady blue-shifted peaks by substituted Cs content together with the marginally reduced carrier-lifetime in the studied mixed cationic compositions. The intensity enhancement of PL peaks with gradual substitution was ascribed to the passivation of non-radiative charge recombination sites (deep trap states) by Cs ions. The slower lifetime along with the red-shifted PL of MAPbBr3 nanocrystals compared to other mixed compositions recommend the existence of inter-particle states which endorse the long-range carrier mobility. The thermal stability of the mixed perovskite phases significantly improved compared to the pure MAPbBr3 phase, which can be ascribed to the enriched interaction between CH3NH3+ and Br− in the cage because of their lattice contraction of the cubo-octahedral volume in the presence of Cs+. These results validate the substantial stability concern of such mixed systems, providing a consistent portrayal of structure–property relationships in the MA1−xCsxPbBr3 systems with precise substitution levels. These altered properties might, in turn, have important contributions on the proficiencies of the solar cells of tandem and multijunction types, mainly composed of high band-energy gap materials as active layers.
