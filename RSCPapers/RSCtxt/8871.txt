    , Accepted 28th November 2019First published on 12th December 2019AbstractPhoto-rechargeable batteries (PRBs) benefit from their bifunctionality covering energy harvesting and storage. However, dim-light performances of the PRBs for indoor applications have not been reported. Herein, we present an external-power-free single-structured PRB named a dye-sensitized photo-rechargeable battery (DSPB) with an outstanding light-to-charge energy efficiency (ηoverall) of 11.5% under the dim light condition. This unprecedented ηoverall was attributed to the thermodynamically-favorable design of the DSPB that maximizes the working potential. At high-power irradiation, the kinetically-fast but thermodynamically-unfavorable iodine mediator (I−/I3−) showed the highest charge and discharge capacities even if its discharge voltage was lowest. Under dim-light for indoor applications, however, the thermodynamically-favorable but kinetically-slow copper complex mediator (Cu+/2+(dmp)2) showed energy density and efficiency superior to I−/I3− because its kinetics did not limit the harvesting capacity. The successful demonstration of the ability of the DSPB to operate a temperature-sensing IoT device only by indoor light opens the possibility of realizing indoor-light-harvesting PRBs.

Broader context
Buildings account for approximately 40% of world energy consumption. Building energy management system industries have been rapidly growing to improve the energy efficiency of buildings for reducing carbon emission. Wireless sensors and controllers connected to the internet (internet of things or IoT) play an important role in the building management system by monitoring and controlling the indoor conditions. The wireless IoT devices powered by batteries require cumbersome battery replacement. Therefore, a photovoltaic power supply is considered to be most ideal for the wireless devices but only if the indoor dim light could generate enough power to operate the devices. Here, we present a photo-rechargeable battery, which successfully operated a wireless IoT sensor by using low-intensity indoor light. The indoor photo-rechargeable battery is a device that can integrate both energy harvesting and storage, which should be distinguished from indoor solar cells.

Introduction
Internet-of-things devices and sensor networks are becoming widespread in our daily life and smart factories. Batteries have been used to supply power to the devices to overcome the limited reach of grid power connection. However, batteries have to be replaced or recharged by grid electricity after their stored energy gets exhausted. Photo-rechargeable batteries (PRBs) have been designed to have bifunctionality of photo-energy harvesting and storage integrated in a single structure.1,2 Photo-excited electrons are stored in electric double layers or reduced chemical species.3,4 As an example, a PRB could be designed to be photo-charged by a photo-anodic process and a cathodic process of an electroactive species. PRBs do not require electro-charging so they are expected to be one of the promising indoor power suppliers to overcome the limitation of conventional batteries.5–7 However, dim-light performances of the PRBs for indoor applications have not been reported.
To achieve a high energy density of a PRB under dim light conditions, it is first necessary to increase (1) the gap of the reduction potential between the electroactive species on the photo-electrode and the storage-electrode and then (2) the charge densities (concentration) of the electroactive species. Charge and mass transfer kinetics is not as important as the thermodynamic gap (therefore, the kinetics is the second consideration) because the photo-excitation process under dim light irradiation is slow enough to limit the overall kinetics. The dye-sensitized photo-electrodes have been most popularly employed for harvesting solar energy in PRBs. Especially, they are a promising candidate for indoor light-energy conversion because dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have been demonstrated to be superior to other photovoltaics such as silicon and organic solar cells under low light intensity.8–10 Although the reduction potential of the redox mediator in the photo-electrode compartment is allowed up to the HOMO level of the dye molecule (e.g., +1.08 V versus NHE (VNHE) for Y123), only the iodine mediator (I−/I3−) at +0.4 VNHE (much more negative than the HOMO level) has been employed in the dye-sensitized photo-electrodes of PRBs. We have a large margin to increase the reduction potential of the mediator and therefore to increase the overall cell potential. From the viewpoint of the charge density, on the other hand, an electroactive species soluble in the electrolyte in the storage-electrode compartment (e.g., S42−/S22−, V3+/2+ and C8H6N20/x−11–13) would not be preferred since insoluble solid electroactive materials immobilized on the electrode (e.g., WO30/x− and polypyrrolex+/014,15) are expected to exhibit higher charge densities. It is difficult to reach charge densities higher than 1000 C cm−3 using soluble electroactive species: 580 C cm−3 for 3 M S42−/S22− (soluble) and 10 C cm−3 for 0.1 M C8H6N20/x− (soluble; x = 1 assumed) versus 1500 C cm−3 for WO30/x− (insoluble; x = 0.5 assumed).11,13,14
Single-structured PRBs have generally employed capacitive storage rather than battery-type storage. The mismatch of potential level between the photo-electrode and active materials of lithium ion batteries (LIBs) was the main concern:16–18 the reduction potentials of anode materials are too negative to accept charge from the photo-electrode while those of cathode materials are too positive to achieve a high working potential during discharge. Instead of single structures, photo-rechargeable systems have been realized by a wire connecting a LIB to a photovoltaic pack having multiple photovoltaic cells in series (two devices in a system).19–22 The hybrid battery–photovoltaic systems suffer from a bulky design, overcharge risk and energy loss due to wire connection.17,18 For indoor applications, therefore, single-structured PRBs are expected to be superior to the two devices in a system. Also, photo-assisted rechargeable batteries have been proposed, in which photo-energy was used only to reduce external-power consumption during charging.23–27 However, they are far away from self-rechargeable systems.
In this work, we present an external-power-free single-structured PRB (named a dye-sensitized photo-rechargeable battery or DSPB) especially designed for indoor light energy harvesting. The DSPB was designed to be photo-charged by the photo-anodic process of DSSCs and the cathodic process of LIBs. The extra lithium insertion reaction of LiMn2O4 spinel to Li2Mn2O4 at +3.0 VLi+/Li (V versus Li+/Li) was carefully selected as the cathodic process on the storage-electrode. The Mn4+/3+ electrochemistry has a high charge density at 2300 C cm−3 at the reduction potential appropriate for operating the PRB. The instability of the reaction was overcome by wrapping the LiMn2O4 particles with a few layers of graphene (LMO@Gn). DSPB performances were strongly dependent on the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of the mediators. Under high-power irradiation, the kinetics of charge and/or mass transfer of the mediator determined the overall DSPB performances. Under the low-power irradiation of indoor lights, however, the reduction potential of the mediator (thermodynamics) determined the performances in terms of photo-charging energy density and overall efficiency because its kinetics did not limit the harvesting capacity. We demonstrated a successful operation of the DSPB based on a kinetically slow but high potential copper complex mediator (Cu+/2+(dmp)2) and the LiMn2O4-to-Li2Mn2O4 reaction only using indoor light.
Results and discussion
Working principle
The DSPB consisted of three electrodes (Fig. 1a): a photo-electrode (PE), a storage electrode (SE) and an auxiliary discharge electrode (DE). Dye-sensitized TiO2 particles were loaded on a transparent conductive oxide electrode for the PE. The PE was constructed in the form of two layers of TiO2 on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass: electrolyte|4.0 μm-thick scattering layer of TiO2 in >100 nm|3.5 μm-thick active layer of TiO2 in 30 nm|FTO (Fig. S1, ESI†). Incident light passing through FTO excites the dye (or sensitizer) molecules immobilized on the nanoporous active layer. A portion of the light passing through the active layer was scattered by the second layer of TiO2 and re-utilized in the active layer. The co-sensitizer system including Y123 and DN-F10 was employed for efficient light harvesting (Fig. 1b).28,29

(b) Molecular structures of dyes (Y123 and DN-F10) and mediators (I−/I3−, Co2+/3+(bpy)3 and Cu+/2+(dmp)2). (c) Transmission electron microscopic images of LMO@Gn. (d) Cyclic voltammograms of active materials for energy storage in 0.1 M LiClO4 in acetonitrile. The mediator is oxidized (I− → I3−; Co2+(bpy)3 → Co3+(bpy)3; or Cu+(dmp)2 → Cu2+(dmp)2) and LMO@Gn is reduced (LiMn2O4 → Li2Mn2O4) for energy storage by photo-charging. 
During the photo-charging process, electrons of dye molecules are photo-excited from the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO). The photo-excited electrons are transferred to the conduction band of TiO2 and then flow through an external circuit to the SE. The active material of the SE, lithium manganese oxide spinel (LiMn2O4 or LMO) wrapped with a-few-layer graphene (LMO@Gn), is reduced by accepting the electrons from the PE via: LiMn(III)Mn(IV)O4 + Li+ + e− → Li2Mn(III)Mn(III)O4(1)
The mediator (Mred) in the compartment of the PE donates electrons to regenerate the photo-oxidized dye molecules (Dox) (Fig. 1b):30 Mred → Mox + ne−(2) Dox + e− → Dred(3)
The photo-charging process proceeds until all molecules of the active materials of the SE are completely reduced or all the mediator molecules are completely oxidized. Overcharge is not allowed because the dye is regenerated only by the mediator oxidation (eqn (2) and (3)).
Different electrolytes were used for the PE and the SE, respectively: a mediator in acetonitrile was used for the PE and 0.8 M LiClO4 in acetonitrile was used for the SE. A Li+-conductive oxide separator between the PE and the SE (lithium-ion conducting glass ceramic, LICGCTM) does not allow ions except for Li+ to transport between the compartments, blocking the mix-up of the electrolytes.31 Therefore, the oxidized mediator molecules are not reduced on the counter electrode (the SE in DSPB), which distinguishes the DSPB from DSSCs. Photo-energy is stored as chemical energy in an oxidized form of the mediators of the PE (Mox) and in a reduced form of the active material of the SE (Li2Mn2O4). There is no possibility of overcharge problems because the Fermi level of TiO2 limits the upper (or negative) potential cutoff of the active material of the SE.12,32,33
The discharging process proceeds between the SE and the DE without using the PE (Fig. 1a). The DE was made by depositing Pt metal on the PE-side of the Li+-conductive separator in a stripe pattern (Fig. S2, ESI†). During the discharge, the reduced active material on the SE is oxidized (the backward reaction of eqn (1)) while the oxidized mediator is reduced to its reduced state on the DE (the backward reaction of eqn (2)). As a summary, the PE works as the photo-anode during photo-charging while the DE is the cathode for mediator reduction during discharge. The SE is used in both charge and discharge processes, acting as the cathode for charge and the anode for discharge processes.30 The mediator in its reduced state (Mred) works as a charge regenerator during photo-charging while the oxidized mediator (Mox) is the catholyte used to generate electricity.
LMO@Gn as a storage material
The working potential of the DSPB (VdCh) is the potential difference between the redox mediator in the DE compartment and the active material of the SE (VdCh = VDE − VSE). The reduction potential of the active material of the SE should be between the reduction potential of the redox mediator and the Fermi level of TiO2. As high-energy-density storage materials, cathode or anode materials practically used in LIBs could be considered to be the active material of the SE. However, cathode materials used in LIBs (e.g., LiMn2O4 spinel or LMO) are not appropriate since they are intrinsically reduced species and therefore they cannot be reduced. For example, LMO is oxidized at around +4.0 VLi+/Li (+1.0 VNHE): LiMn(III)Mn(IV)O4 → Mn(IV)Mn(IV)O4 + Li+ + e−(4)
Also, the reduction potential of the reaction is too positive to achieve a high working potential of the DSPB. On the other hand, the reduction potentials of anode materials of LIBs (e.g., ∼0 VLi+/Li or −3.0 VNHE) are much more negative than the Fermi level of TiO2. The active materials having very negative reduction potentials cannot accept electrons from TiO2. Therefore, neither cathode nor anode materials of LIBs can be used as the active material of the SE of the DSPB.
Instead of the anodic reaction of LMO at +4.0 VLi+/Li popularly used in LIBs, we used another cathodic reaction of LMO at ∼+3.0 VLi/Li+ or 0 VNHE (eqn (1)) for the DSPB. The cathodic nature of the reaction and its reduction potential being more positive than the TiO2 Fermi level satisfy the requirements of the active materials of the SE for the DSPB. However, unfortunately, the reversibility of the +3.0 VLi+/Li reaction has been reported to be very poor due to the Jahn–Teller distortion developed during the phase transition between the cubic phase of LiMn2O4 and the tetragonal phase of Li2Mn2O4.34 This limitation was overcome by nano-sizing and graphene-wrapping LMO particles (LMO@Gn in Fig. 1c and Fig. S3, ESI†).35 10 μm LMO particles were ground in the presence of graphite to form LMO@Gn in a significantly reduced size by using high-energy ball milling (Fig. S3b and c, ESI†). The crystallite size estimated from the (111) peak of XRD by the Scherrer equation was reduced from 135 nm for bare LMO to 63 nm for LMO@Gn (Fig. S3a, ESI†). The graphitic layer of LMO@Gn was identified by the X-ray diffraction peak at 26° and the transmission-electron-microscopic image (Fig. 1c). The LMO@Gn showed quasi-reversibility with long-term cyclability guaranteed (Fig. S4, ESI†).
Mediator-dependent DSPB performances
Three different molecules were tested as the mediator of DSPB: I−/I3−, Co2+/3+(bpy)3 and Cu+/2+(dmp)2 (bpy = 2,2′-bipyridine; dmp = 2,9-dimethyl-1,10-phenanthroline; Fig. 1b).36–40 The nanoparticular TiO2 (30 nm in size) in the active layer of PE provides a porosity to allow diffusion of the metal complex mediators (ligand-to-ligand length = 1.2 nm) inside the porous active layer. From the thermodynamic standpoint, mediators were identified by their reduction potential (Fig. 1d). The reduction potential was measured by the average potential of cathodic and anodic peak potentials (E1/2) of the cyclic voltammograms: E1/2 = +0.92 VNHE for Cu+/2+(dmp)2, +0.57 VNHE for Co2+/3+(bpy)3 and +0.40 VNHE for I−/I3−. The mediators are appropriate for being paired with LMO@Gn for DSPBs since their E1/2 were more positive than that of LMO@Gn (+0.2 VNHE). A mediator of more positive reduction potential on DE makes a higher VdCh of a DSPB cell. A higher energy density would be obtained from the cell at a higher VdCh if the kinetics were facile enough to support the thermodynamic driving force. From the thermodynamic standpoint, therefore, Cu+/2+(dmp)2 was the best choice, followed by Co2+/3+(bpy)3 and I−/I3−.
Unfortunately, however, the sluggish kinetics of the most-positive-potential mediator Cu+/2+(dmp)2 limited the photo-charging capacity (QCh). DSPBs were photo-charged for 5 min under one sun condition (100 mW cm−2; Fig. 2a), followed by being discharged galvanostatically (Fig. 2b). Photo-charging current (JCh) decreased with time as the reduced mediator was oxidized and LiMn2O4 was lithiated or reduced to Li2Mn2O4.41,42 The highest QCh (calculated from the area below the chronoamperometric curves in Fig. 2a) was obtained from I−/I3−, followed by Co2+/3+(bpy)3 and Cu+/2+(dmp)2: QCh = 111 C cm−3 for I−/I3−; 83.0 C cm−3 for Co2+/3+(bpy)3; and 38.6 C cm−3 for Cu+/2+(dmp)2. The QCh and JCh of DSPBs based on Cu+/2+(dmp)2 were significantly lower than those of I−/I3− and Co2+/3+(bpy)3, indicating the sluggish kinetics of Cu+/2+(dmp)2. The QCh values of all mediators were fully utilized during discharge at 0.03 mA cm−2 without loss so that discharge capacity (QdCh in Fig. 2b) approached QCh. Charge-to-discharge coulombic efficiency (ηQ = QdCh/QCh) was estimated at ∼100%, which was independent of mediators and light intensities (Fig. S5, ESI†). Therefore, QdCh was determined by the kinetics of mediators during photo-charging processes. The highest QdCh of I−/I3− supported the highest discharge energy density (EDdCh in Fig. 2c) even if its discharge potential is lowest: e.g., EDdCh = 7.8 mW h cm−3 at 100 mW cm−2. Correspondingly, the light-to-charge energy efficiency (ηoverall) of I−/I3− was estimated at 0.53% (cf., ηoverall = 0.39% for Cu+/2+(dmp)2), which is determined by ηoverall = (EDdChV)/(PinAtch)20,43 with V = the volume of the active material (LMO@Gn) of SE, Pin = the incident light intensity, A = the electrode area of PE, and tCh = the photo-charging time. The overall efficiency ηoverall is the efficiency of the light-to-charge conversion process of the DSPB including the photon-to-electron conversion for energy harvesting (estimated by the power conversion efficiency, ηPCE) and the electron-to-discharged-chemical-energy conversion for energy storage and utilization (estimated by the storage efficiency, ηstorage) (Fig. S6, ESI†): ηoverall = ηPCEηstorage.

(e) Capacity retention of DSPBs during cycles of photo-charging at 100 mW cm−2 for 5 min and discharging at −0.03 mA cm−2 up to 1 mV. 
In addition to photo-charging, evidence of the sluggish kinetics of the dye regeneration process by mediators was found during discharge. The average discharge cell voltage (VdCh) was 0.61 V for Cu+/2+(dmp)2, 0.36 V for Co2+/3+(bpy)3 and 0.26 V for I−/I3− (Fig. 2b). The descending order of VdCh followed that of E1/2 of the mediators. The VdCh–E1/2 correspondence in their orders is easily understood since VdCh is determined by the difference of E1/2 between mediator and LMO@Gn (ΔE1/2,LMO). However, the VdCh of Cu+/2+(dmp)2 having the highest reduction potential was significantly smaller than the corresponding ΔE1/2,LMO: VdCh = 0.61 V versus ΔE1/2,LMO = 0.72 V. A kinetic limitation causing polarization is expected from the smaller VdCh for Cu+/2+(dmp)2. On the other hand, there appears to be insignificant kinetic polarization found in the presence of I−/I3− and Co2+/3+(bpy)3 (VdChversus ΔE1/2,LMO = 0.26 V versus 0.20 V for I−/I3−, 0.36 V versus 0.37 V for Co2+/3+(bpy)3).
To correlate the cell-level kinetic limitation to the material-level properties of mediators, kinetic parameters were measured and compared (Fig. 3, Fig. S7, S8 and Table S1 (ESI†); Measurement and calculation details in the ESI†). The photo-charging current of the DSPB at the short circuit between PE and SE (Isc,PE–SE) is determined by the light harvesting efficiency (ηlh), the charge injection efficiency (ηinj), the charge collection efficiency (ηcc) and the charge regeneration efficiency (ηreg):44Isc,PE–SE = qI0ηlhηinjηccηreg with q = the elementary charge, and I0 = the incident photon flux. The ηreg, a measure of how efficiently electrons are transferred from mediator molecules to dye molecules, is the single variable when mediators are varied and the electrode components and the dye of PE were fixed. The ηreg was measured by using the time-correlated-single-photon-counting technique. I−/I3− showed the highest efficiency at 81%, followed by Co2+/3+(bpy)3 at 74% and Cu+/2+(dmp)2 at 72%, which is consistent with the mediator-dependency of capacity. The ηreg was closely correlated with (1) the charge transfer kinetics (represented by the standard rate constant, k0, and the charge transfer resistance, Rct) and (2) the mass transfer kinetics (the ionic diffusion coefficient, D, and the Warburg impedance, Wbulk).45–47 I−/I3− showed the highest k0 (1.9 × 10−3 cm s−1) and D (3.2 × 10−5 cm2 s−1) and the lowest Rct (0.66 Ω) and Wbulk (3.13 Ω), followed by Co2+/3+(bpy)3 and Cu+/2+(dmp)2. The kinetic limitation was shown clearly when photo-charging light intensities and discharge rates were controlled. The photo-charged capacities of Cu+/2+(dmp)2 were relatively independent of light intensity variations while that of I−/I3− and Co2+/3+(bpy)3 increased with increasing light power (Fig. S5, ESI†). In the same vein, the mediator of the most sluggish kinetics (Cu+/2+(dmp)2) showed a significant decrease of ηQ with increasing discharge current while the ηQ of the others did not change significantly with discharge rates (Fig. 2d).

Capacity durability was investigated during the repeated photo-charge/galvanostatic discharge cycles (Fig. 2e). An initial increase in QdCh was observed for all tested mediators, which indicates that the SE is possibly responsible for the increase. The poly-crystalline-characteristic surface of LMO@Gn particles having several nm grains evolved to 100 nm-scale single-crystal nanoparticles during the repeated charge/discharge cycles (Fig. S9, ESI†). The nanoparticles were well conjugated to each other, showing close interparticular contacts but clear boundaries. The bigger size of the crystalline domain (from 100 nm to 102 nm) decreases the tortuosity of lithium ion pathways while the well-contacted interparticular boundary possibly provides highways for lithium ion transport. The lithium ion pathways developed during the initial cycles make the intrinsic capacity of LMO more realized in effect.35 The I−/I3−-containing cell showing the largest increase of QdCh required the longest duration of the LMO morphology transition before reaching the saturated capacity (Fig. 2e). Both I−/I3− and Co2+/3+(bpy)3 exhibited stable capacity (QdCh) retention during cycles while the QdCh and ηoverall decreased significantly during cycles in the presence of the kinetically slow Cu+/2+(dmp)2. The instability of cycle retention of Cu+/2+(dmp)2 cells was more emphasized when the charge-to-discharge efficiency (ηQ) was considered instead of the overall efficiency (Fig. S10, ESI†). Both I−/I3− and Co2+/3+(bpy)3 exhibited near 100% ηQ during all cycles except for several initial cycles. However, the slow kinetics of Cu+/2+(dmp)2 did not guarantee stable capacity retention.
Indoor lighting harvest and storage
The sluggish kinetics of Cu+/2+(dmp)2 limited the capacities (QCh and QdCh) at one sun irradiation even if Cu+/2+(dmp)2 has the thermodynamic benefit of the most positive reduction potential. The merit of Cu+/2+(dmp)2 could be revived in a slow-charging situation. The indoor light intensity of bedrooms and study rooms is 300 to 600 lux and 500 to 1000 lux, respectively, which are less than 0.5% one sun illumination.48–50 The DSPBs were tested at light intensities less than 0.60 mW cm−2 (2000 lux) by using a light emitting diode (LED) (Fig. S11, ESI†).51,52 They were photo-charged for 10 min as the optimized photo-exposed time that was chosen from the photo-charging time dependency of the overall energy efficiency (ηoverall) of Cu+/2+(dmp)2-containing cells (Fig. S12, ESI†). To achieve a high ηoverall, shorter photo-charging times of less than 5 min were preferred at a higher illuminance of 1000 to 2000 lux. However, a photo-charging duration longer than 7 min was required at a lower illuminance of 200 to 500 lux. The photo-charging duration of 10 min was chosen for focusing on dim-light applications. At low light powers, interestingly, the kinetically-slowest Cu+/2+(dmp)2 showed a higher ηoverall than the kinetically-faster I−/I3− and Co2+/3+(bpy)3 (Fig. 4a; ηPCE and ηstorage in Fig. S6, ESI†). The ηoverall at 11.5% obtained from Cu+/2+(dmp)2 at 0.15 mW cm−2 (500 lux) for 10 min charging is considered to be a very high efficiency, being four times as large as the ηoverall at 2.9% obtained from the supercapacitor wire-connected to an organic solar cell at 340 lux (2.9% for 52 min charging or 1.2% for 15 min charging53). To the best of our knowledge, the DSPB of this work is the first reported single-structured PRB successfully operated by an indoor light source (Fig. S13, ESI†).

(e) The ηoverall durability of DSPBs under dim light of a compact fluorescent lamp (Pin = 0.24 mW cm−2). 
The superiority of Cu+/2+(dmp)2 especially under dim-light conditions could be understood from a kinetic standpoint. The photo-charging process is not limited kinetically anymore in dim-light situations because the photo-stimulating power is too low to reach the kinetic limitation. The gaps of the initial JCh between kinetically fast and slow mediators were significantly large at one sun (Fig. 2a). Under dim-light conditions, however, the JCh of all mediators became similar with the gaps reduced. In the initial period of photo-charging, the kinetically-slow Cu+/2+(dmp)2 even overwhelmed the kinetically-fast I−/I3− in terms of JCh (Fig. 4b). In the same vein, the maximum efficiency of light-power-to-photo-current (ηIP′peak)54 of the Cu+/2+(dmp)2 cell was estimated to be higher than those of other mediators specifically at low light intensities less than 1 mW cm−2 (Fig. 4d). Therefore, a similarly identical amount of charge (QCh) was stored independent of the mediator under dim-light conditions. The thermodynamic benefit of a more-positive-reduction-potential mediator leads to higher EDdCh because a similar amount of charge is released at a higher cell voltage during discharge (Fig. 4c). Photo-charge/galvanostatic discharge profiles under indoor light evidently supported the superiority of Cu+/2+(dmp)2 under dim light conditions (Fig. S14, ESI†). The difference of capacities between mediators became gradually negligible as the illuminance decreased from 2000 lux to 200 lux. Consequently, a higher VdCh of Cu+/2+(dmp)2 led to a higher EDdCh, confirming the thermodynamic gain. Therefore, the cell voltage was considered as the dominant factor that was more important than charge regeneration kinetics of mediators from the viewpoint of indoor energy harvesting.
We successfully operated a melody kit and an IoT device by using the DSPBs based on Cu+/2+(dmp)2 after photo-charging under commercial indoor light sources (compact fluorescent lamp and LED; Fig. S11c; refer to the ESI† video clips and Fig. S15 for details). Multiple DSPB cells were connected in series to meet the operating voltage of the devices (>3.5 V). The decrease in ηoverall of Cu+/2+(dmp)2 during the cycle observed at one sun (Fig. 2e) was not found under low-intensity light (Fig. 4e).
Conclusions
An external-power-free single-structured PRB, named a DSPB, was developed and its operation under indoor light was successfully demonstrated. The DSPB was designed (1) to harvest light energy by a dye and then (2) to store the harvested energy by oxidizing a redox mediator on the photo-electrode (PE) and reducing the other redox-active species (LMO@Gn) on the storage electrode (SE). Over-lithiation of LMO@Gn (LiMn2O4 + Li+ + e− → Li2Mn2O4) was carefully selected as the energy storage process on the SE, satisfying the requirements of the reduction process at the potential more negative than the potential of the mediators. Different from the high-power irradiation cases, the kinetics of charge and mass transfer of mediators did not limit the overall process in dim-light situations so that the thermodynamically-favorable and therefore more-positive-reduction-potential mediator was preferred without the kinetic consideration. The high-voltage copper complex mediator (Cu+/2+(dmp)2) was superior to the kinetically-fast but thermodynamically-unfavorable (more negative reduction potential) iodine mediator (I−/I3−) in terms of photo-charging energy density and overall efficiency.

Broader context
Buildings account for approximately 40% of world energy consumption. Building energy management system industries have been rapidly growing to improve the energy efficiency of buildings for reducing carbon emission. Wireless sensors and controllers connected to the internet (internet of things or IoT) play an important role in the building management system by monitoring and controlling the indoor conditions. The wireless IoT devices powered by batteries require cumbersome battery replacement. Therefore, a photovoltaic power supply is considered to be most ideal for the wireless devices but only if the indoor dim light could generate enough power to operate the devices. Here, we present a photo-rechargeable battery, which successfully operated a wireless IoT sensor by using low-intensity indoor light. The indoor photo-rechargeable battery is a device that can integrate both energy harvesting and storage, which should be distinguished from indoor solar cells.
