    , Accepted 7th June 2014First published on 9th June 2014AbstractWe have achieved 8% efficiency for the ruthenium(II) dye, SY-04, in quasi-solid state dye sensitized solar cells using a supramolecular oligomer-based electrolyte. The dyes in this study, SY-04 and SY-05, which were synthesized through highly efficient synthetic routes, showed better molar extinction coefficients compared to that of the Z907 dye. In the absorption spectra, SY-04 and SY-05 displayed better red shifted metal ligand charge transfer (MLCT) absorption bands at 533, 382 and 535, 373 nm, respectively, compared with 521, 371 nm of the Z907 dye. Also, SY-04 and SY-05 showed better molar extinction coefficients, 6691, 16189 M−1 cm−1 and 6694, 16195 M−1 cm−1 as compared with the Z907 dye, 4308, 4917 M−1 cm−1. When excited into the charge-transfer absorption bands of SY-04 and SY-05 in ethanol at 77 K, broad emission bands for SY-04 and SY-05 with a maximum at 788 nm and 786 nm, respectively, were observed compared to the emission band of Z907 at 797 nm. The current–voltage characteristics of the SY-04 sensitizer gave the best performance data, JSC = 18.0 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.662 V, ff = 0.663, and an η of 8.0%. The increased VOC value for SY-04 than Z907 is mainly attributed to high charge recombination resistance by effective dye coverage, which is confirmed by impedance spectroscopy.
Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) have emerged as one of the most promising alternatives to cost-intensive silicon-based photovoltaic devices.1 The conventional DSC is composed of two conductive substrates, a porous structured metal oxide semiconductor film coated with a sensitizer and a liquid electrolyte. Although power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) close to 13% could be achieved with this device architecture,2,3 the existence of the liquid electrolyte in DSCs has several drawbacks such as leakage, volatilization of the organic solvent, possible desorption of the surface-coated dyes, corrosion of the counter electrodes and limited long-term performance, which restricts the widespread commercialization of DSCs.4 Replacing liquid electrolytes with hole-transporting materials (HTMs) is one of the most promising methods to avoid these problems.5 Several attempts have been made to use alternatives, such as organic hole conductors,6,7 physically cross-linked gelators,8,9 and polymer gel electrolytes,10 to liquid electrolytes. Therefore, research on solid state or quasi-solid state dye sensitized solar cells (sDSCs) based on polymer electrolytes has become attractive.4,8,11–17
However, compared with liquid electrolytes, solid state electrolytes often show relatively lower ionic conductivity and poor electrolyte/electrode interfacial contact.5 Among the solid/semi-solid electrolytes studied so far, polymer based quasi-solid-state electrolytes have been attracting a great deal of interest due to their good contact with nano-crystalline TiO2 electrodes and counter electrodes, maintaining good ionic conductivity, reducing cell leakage problems and their comparable efficiencies to cells using liquid electrolytes.18,19 Polymers or co-polymers, such as poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO),18 poly(styrene-co-acrylonitrile),20 poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG),19 poly(methylmethacrylate) (PMMA),21 poly-(acrylonitrile-co-vinyl acetate)22 and poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene)23,24 have been applied as the gel electrolytes.
Oligomers have been utilized successfully by a technique known as the “oligomer approach” to provide a better interfacial contact between dyes and electrolytes as well as increased ionic conductivity for sDSCs, resulting in high-energy conversion efficiencies.13–15 Three different oligomer approaches for the preparation of sDSCs employing liquid oligomer-based electrolytes have been reported. The first approach was to utilize supramolecules of the PEG oligomer (Mw 1000 g mol−1), which is a liquid during the cell fabrication procedure but becomes a solid polymer electrolyte upon solvent evaporation. This solidification is referred to as in situ self-solidification, and an energy conversion efficiency (η) of 3.34% was achieved.13 Second, the use of an oligomer blend containing an amorphous liquid oligomer poly(propylene glycol) (Mw = 750 g mol−1) with a high-molecular-weight PEO (Mw = 1000000 g mol−1) resulted in an η of 3.84%.14 Third, low molecular poly(ethylene glycol) oligomer (Mw = 500 g mol−1) based electrolytes have been solidified using fumed silica nanoparticles as a networking agent to become nanocomposites, resulting in a comparably good conversion efficiency of 4.5%.15 Therefore, the oligomer approach utilizing liquid oligomers, followed by in situ self-solidification has proven to be very effective for preparing sDSCs with good energy conversion efficiency, primarily resulting from the enlarged interfacial contact between the dyes and the electrolyte and the increased ionic conductivity.25
sDSCs with high efficiency have been reported when using an amphiphilic, heterolyptic ruthenium sensitizer.26–28 This improved efficiency is attributed to the self-assembly of the dye, which forms a dense layer on the surface of the TiO2 nanoparticles, with its carboxylate groups acting as anchors and its hydrophobic isolating chains acting as a blocking layer between the hole conductor and TiO2.26–28 sDSCs are particularly interesting, with their open circuit photovoltage (VOC) often exceeding that of electrolyte-based DSCs due to a smaller energy loss during the dye regeneration process.29,30 Nevertheless, the overall photovoltaic conversion efficiency of sDSCs attained currently with standard ruthenium complexes28 or organic dyes31 remains significantly below that of electrolyte-based devices because the short-circuit current (JSC) of the former is smaller compared to the latter. The smaller JSC values in the case of ruthenium complexes arise from the fact that the sDSCs usually employ only 1.5 to 3 μm-thick nanocrystalline TiO2 films to ascertain quantitative collection of the photo-generated charge carriers and complete pore filling by the hole conductor. As the solar light harvesting by such thin films depends strongly on the optical cross-section of the sensitizer, the use of a high-molar-extinction-coefficient dye in combination with such thin mesoporous TiO2 electrodes is advantageous. Much research has focused on increasing the extinction coefficient and red response of heterolyptic ruthenium complexes by extending the π-conjugation of the ancillary ligand and endowing it with electron-donating groups.6,26,32–35
In solid state electrolyte-based DSCs the electrolyte percolation throughout the photoanode pore-channel governs the thickness of the photoanode (TiO2), pore diameter and dye structure. Unlike liquid electrolyte-based DSCs, the high thickness TiO2 electrode exhibits poor filling for the solid state electrolyte. Therefore, an electrode with small thickness is always desirable for effective pore-filling. But, the electrode with small thickness has a disadvantage on light harvesting. To balance the electrolyte pore-filling and effective light harvesting even for a small thickness of the TiO2 electrode, one should find a dye with a high-molar-extinction-coefficient.
In this work, we utilized supramolecular oligomer-based polymer electrolytes to ensure effective pore filling for the preparation of quasi-sDSCs based on ruthenium dyes with a high molar extinction coefficient. We have previously reported that SY-04 and SY-05 dyes prepared through the efficient HEW reaction showed a high molar extinction coefficient.36 When we fabricated quasi-sDSCs based on SY-04, it showed a maximum power conversion efficiency of 8.0%, which is a 10% increase compared with that of a quasi-sDSC based on Z907 under the same fabrication conditions.
Experimental section
General procedures
All of the reactions were performed under a nitrogen atmosphere, and solvents were distilled from appropriate drying agents prior to use. Commercially available reagents were used without further purification, unless otherwise stated. All reactions were monitored using precoated thin-layer chromatographic plates (0.20 mm) with a fluorescent indicator UV254 (uvitec-LF-204.LS). The organic precursors were purified by column chromatography using Silica gel (60–120 mesh, Merck). The complexes, SY-04 and SY-05, were purified using Sephadex-LH-20 (Sigma) resin. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AMX 500 or AV 500 instrument. Mass spectra were obtained on a JMS-700 double focusing mass spectrometer (JEOL, Tokyo, Japan). Elemental analysis was carried out with a Perkin-Elmer 2400 CHN analyzer. Electronic absorption spectra were obtained on a Cary 50 Probe UV-visible-NIR spectrophotometer. The cyclic voltammograms were recorded on a CHI600A electrochemical analyzer.
Synthesis of SY-04 and SY-05
The ruthenium dyes, SY-04 and SY-05, were synthesized previously and the molecular structures are given in Fig. 1.36
 Fig. 1  Molecular structures of SY-04, SY-05 and Z907. 
Electrolyte preparation
The oligomer blend electrolyte was made by blending the high-molecular-weight PEO (Mw 1000000 g mol−1) and low-molecular-weight poly(ethylene glycol) dimethyl ether, (oligo-PEGDME, Mw 500 g mol−1) with a mole ratio of [–O–]–[XI] 20:1 (here X is, 1-methyl-3-propylimidazolium cation) and XI–I2, 10:1, w/w in acetonitrile. The blend ratio of PEO to the oligomer was fixed at 4:6 (w/w). The advantage of using MPII (1-methyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide) is that it is an ionic liquid and does not exhibit any vapour pressure. All chemicals were purchased from Aldrich and used as received. MPII was obtained from Solaronix (Switzerland).13–15
DSC fabrication
Quasi-sDSCs were fabricated as follows. Transparent SnO2/F-layered conductive glass (FTO, purchased from Pilkington. Co. Ltd., Pilkington-TEC8) was employed to prepare both the photo- and counter-electrodes. For the photoelectrode, a TiCl4 solution (Aldrich) was first spin-coated onto FTO glass, and then the glass was heated stepwise to 450 °C and maintained at this temperature for 20 min. Commercialized TiO2 paste of 20 nm size (Ti-nanoxide T, Solaronix) was cast onto the FTO glass by a doctor-blade technique and successive sintering at 450 °C for 30 min. The nanocrystalline TiO2 film (with a thickness of ca. 13–18 μm) was sensitized overnight with SY-04, SY-05 and Z907 (Ruthenizer 520-DN, Solaronix) dye solutions. Pt-layered counter-electrodes were prepared by spin-coating of an H2PtCl6 solution (0.05 mol dm−3 in isopropanol, Aldrich) onto FTO glass and then successive sintering at 400 °C for 30 min. For solar cell fabrication, a dilute polymer electrolyte solution was first cast onto a dye-adsorbed TiO2 electrode and evaporated very slowly for easy penetration of electrolyte through the nanopores of the TiO2 layer. Next, a highly concentrated polymer electrolyte solution was cast onto the photoelectrode to minimize the time for evaporation of the solvent as well as to prevent the formation of cavities between the two electrodes during the solvent evaporation. Both electrodes were superposed together and then pressed between two glass plates to achieve slow evaporation of solvent as well as to obtain a very thin SPE layer. The cells were placed in a vacuum oven for the complete evaporation of solvent for 1 day and then sealed with an epoxy resin.
Current voltage measurements

J–V curves were measured with a solar simulator (Newport, Oriel Class A, 91195A) with a source meter (Keithley 2420) at 100 mA cm−2 illumination (AM 1.5G) and a calibrated Si reference cell certified by NREL.
Incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency spectra (IPCE)
IPCE spectra were recorded using a power source with a monochromator (Zahner GmbH) and a multimeter (Keithley 2001). A frequency of 5 Hz and less than 10% of amplitude was applied during the measurement.
Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS)
EIS spectra were recorded with a computer-controlled potentiostat (SP-200, BioLogic, France) producing a small amplitude harmonic voltage, and a frequency response analyzer module. The EIS experiments were performed under dark conditions. The impedance spectra of the devices were obtained at various potentials at 0.62 V for Z907 and 0.57 V for SY-04 and SY-05 at frequencies ranging from 0.05 Hz to 1 MHz, the oscillation potential amplitudes having ca. 25 mV. The measured spectra were fit to an appropriate simplified circuit using the Z-fit software provided by BioLogic (EC-Lab).
Results and discussion
Photophysical studies
The absorption and emission spectra for SY-04, SY-05 and Z907 dyes measured in ethanol (EtOH) are shown in Fig. 2, and the selected parameters are summarized in Table 1. In the UV region, SY-04 and SY-05 dyes show intense absorption bands at 311 nm and 314 nm, which are assigned to the ligand-centred π–π* transitions of the dihexyl thiophene ancillary ligand and dcbpy. These transitions have better molar extinction coefficients (ε), (17088, 16209 M−1 cm−1), compared to that of the Z907 dye (15506 M−1 cm−1). In the visible region, SY-04 and SY-05 show better red shifted MLCT absorption bands at 533, 382 and 535, 373 nm compared with 521, 371 nm for the Z907 dye. In this region also, SY-04 and SY-05 show better molar extinction coefficients, 6691, 16189 M−1 cm−1 and 6694, 16195 M−1 cm−1 as compared with the Z907 dye (4308, 4917 M−1 cm−1). The enhanced molar extinction coefficients and the red shifts are attributed to the extension of π-conjugation in both SY-04 and SY-05 dyes. The red shift of the MLCT band suggests that the band gap between the HOMO and LUMO levels for SY-04 and SY-05 becomes smaller than that of Z907. All the dyes show low emission bands. When excited into the charge-transfer absorption band of SY-04 and SY-05 in EtOH at 77 K, there was a broad emission band with a maximum at 788 nm for SY-04 and 786 nm for SY-05, which is attributed to the luminescence from the lowest energy MLCT state of SY-04 and SY-05 dyes. Z907 shows a luminescent band at 797 nm.

Electrochemical studies
All the oxidation and reduction potentials of SY-04, SY-05 and Z907 were measured in DMF with 0.1 M TBAPF6 (vs. natural hydrogen electrode (NHE)). It was calibrated with ferrocene/ferrocenium as the reference and converted to NHE by the addition of 0.47 V.36,37 As shown in Table 1, the electrochemical oxidation potentials, Eox°, of SY-04 and SY-05 are in the range of 0.88 to 0.92 V vs. NHE that are more comparable to Z907 (0.836 V), but larger than that of the I−/I3− redox couple (ca. 0.4 V vs. NHE). The excited-state oxidation potentials, Eox°*, of SY-04 and SY-05, which range from −0.91 to −0.95 V and −1.04 for Z907, are sufficiently more negative than the conduction-band edge of the TiO2 electrode (ca. −0.5 V vs. NHE) and verifies the efficient electron injection into TiO2. The LUMO levels of SY-04 (−3.38 eV) and SY-05 (−3.42 eV) are more negative compared to the LUMO levels of Z907 (−3.28 eV). This ensures that there is enough driving energy for SY-04 and SY-05 dyes for dye regeneration to occur as compared to Z907.
Photovoltaic studies
The J–V curves of the quasi-sDSCs using SY-04, SY-05 and Z907 sensitizers are presented in Fig. 3. The measurements were carried out at AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2 photon flux), and the photovoltaic parameters of the cells are listed in Table 2. The SY-04 dye based quasi-sDSC yielded markedly a higher open-circuit potential, VOC = 0.662 V, fill factor, ff = 0.663 than those of SY-05 and Z907 dyes.

This implies that the high PCE, η = 8%, in the SY-04 device originates from the high VOC of the device. The high VOC in DSC may be ascribed to several reasons: (a) effective coverage of dye molecules on the TiO2 surface, possibly retarding the recombination pathways of electron leakage from TiO2 to the electrolyte,38,39 (b) increased difference in the Fermi level between photoanode and electrolyte redox, and (c) the efficient charge transfer characteristic at the dye/electrolyte interface.40 In general, VOC of a device depends on the Fermi level difference between TiO2 and the redox position of the electrolyte. The energy level position of the dye is not directly participating in determining the VOC of the device. However, the dye-regeneration rate influences the VOC of the device. For instance, a large difference between the HOMO level and redox will take a larger redox shuttle distance for supplying the electron to the dye. This results in weak dye regeneration and affects the electron injection from the dye to TiO2. It is clear that poor electron injection at the TiO2 Fermi level shows a small difference between the redox mediator and the TiO2 Fermi level, consequently, lowering the VOC value. Therefore, the HOMO of a dye36 influences the VOC of the device by controlling dye-regeneration.41 The high photocurrent existence in SY-05 compared to SY-04 may be attributed to the difference in light photon reception in the visible light wavelengths. The higher fill factor of SY-04 may be attributed to the presence of two alkyl chains on the thiophene moiety, which increases the solubility of the dye and reduces aggregation and exhibits good compatibility. The above discussion indicates that the SY-04 sensitizer is effective with a solid-state electrolyte, and shows 8% higher performance than that (η = 7.2%) of the quasi-sDSC based on Z907 under the same cell fabrication conditions.
IPCE
To understand high photocurrent generations by SY-05 and Z907 compared with SY-04, the photocurrent generation at different wavelengths has been evaluated, and the results are given in Fig. 4. SY sensitizers achieved the maximum in the 480–580 nm range, due to the presence of MLCT absorption bands in that region with an onset value of 800 nm. Z907 showed a maximum of 87% at 529 nm, which is responsible for the highest JSC value of 20.1 mA cm−2 as compared to the SY-sensitizers. The SY-05 dye exhibited its maximum IPCE at 529 nm and showed a broad visible light harvesting region compared to SY-04. This corroborates the possibility of red photon light harvesting in SY-05 which drives higher photocurrent generation than SY-04. These results are consistent with Table 2. The mismatch between UV-visible spectra and IPCE of the dyes is due to the loss of photocurrent42 and the scattering of the incident light by the FTO glass.43

Impedance
As discussed earlier, effective dye anchoring on the TiO2 surface could promote the charge recombination resistance at TiO2/dye interfaces and is further analyzed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy.44–46 The Nyquist plots of quasi-sDSCs using different dye sensitizers are presented in Fig. 5. The second frequency semicircle in the Nyquist plot represents the charge transfer phenomena between the TiO2 surface and the electrolyte. Under dark conditions, the diameter of the second semicircle refers to the charge recombination resistance (Rre) of TiO2/electrolyte interfaces, i.e., dark current.47,48 From the equivalent circuit analysis, the SY-04 sensitizer showed higher Re ∼ 103.8 Ω than SY-05 (Re ∼ 80.5 Ω) indicating that a large amount of C6H13 moieties (dye forest) at the SY-04 dye is effectively blocking the direct contact between the TiO2 surface and the electrolyte, thus retarding the undesirable electron leakage from TiO2 to the electrolyte. The reduced recombination pathways at the TiO2/SY-04/electrolyte interfaces shifting to a more negative TiO2 Fermi level position result in a high VOC of this system. Comparatively, the fact that Z907 showed a high Re value of 112.9 Ω to SY sensitizers may arise from the effective dye coverage at the TiO2 surface.
 Fig. 5  Nyquist plots of SY-04, SY-05 and Z907 measured under dark conditions. Experimental data are represented by symbols and the solid line corresponds to the fits obtained using Z-View software. 
Nevertheless, the Z907 dye showed less VOC than SY-04. One possible reason for the contradictory VOC reduction may originate from a less electron lifetime. Thus, we analyzed the Bode phase characteristic plots of quasi-sDSCs. The SY-04 sensitizer-based device exhibited a large shift towards lower frequency, revealing an increase in the apparent recombination lifetime. The estimated high electron lifetime τ ∼ 54.7 ms (calculated as, τ = 1/ω*, in which ω* is the frequency at the maximum peak in Fig. 6) of SY-04 compared to other devices fostered a high VOC in this system and is in agreement with results given in Table 2. Furthermore, the decrease in the VOC of the SY-05 dye (τ ∼ 39.7 ms) also resulted in the decrease in the lifetime as compared to that (τ ∼ 44.1 ms) of the Z907.
 Fig. 6  The bode plots of quasi-sDSCs using SY-04, SY-05 and Z907 measured at dark (solid curves represent the pristine devices and dash curves indicate the measurement after 10 days at room temperature). 
We have also obtained the Bode plots of quasi-sDSCs measured after 10 days of the fabrication at room temperature and the results are shown in Fig. 6. After 10 days, quasi-sDSCs based on both SY-04 and Z907 dyes show a significant shift in the first peak position toward a higher frequency region. This implies that either the gelator or the dye in the electrolyte is slightly modified by the environment or sealing conditions. On the other hand, sDSCs based on the SY-05 dye do not show any significant change in the first peak position. This suggested that the SY-05 dye is having better compatibility with the gelator in the electrolyte than that of SY-04 and Z907 dyes.49
Conclusions
In this study, we have optimized supramolecular oligomer-based electrolytes for a high molar extinction coefficient for SY-04 and SY-05 ruthenium dyes in fabricating quasi-sDSCs. These dyes show good photophysical properties as compared to the Z907 dye. The electrochemical oxidation potentials, Eox°, of SY-04 and SY-05 are more compared to Z907 and are larger than that of the I−/I3− redox couple. The excited-state oxidation potentials, Eox°*, of SY-04 and SY-05 are sufficiently more negative than the conduction-band edge of the TiO2 electrode. The LUMO levels of SY-04 and SY-05 are more negative compared to the LUMO levels of Z907 and ensure that there is enough driving energy for SY-04 and SY-05 dyes for dye regeneration to occur as compared to Z907. The SY-04 based quasi-sDSCs achieved a maximum power conversion efficiency of 8.0%, which is very high as compared to the previously reported sDSCs based on the amphiphilic ruthenium dyes. The IPCE spectra and electrochemical impedance spectra are well consistent with JSC and VOC values of the dyes.
