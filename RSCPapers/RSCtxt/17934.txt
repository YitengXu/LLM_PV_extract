    , Accepted 7th March 2022First published on 7th March 2022AbstractSteam methane reforming (SMR) is by far the dominant approach of hydrogen production, but its feasibility for producing low-carbon-footprint H2 has been constrained by high reaction temperatures (>800 °C), complexity of processes, and high energy penalties associated with H2 and CO2 separation. To address such key challenges, we propose a new principle of multi-product sequential separation and a new method of sequential separation-driven SMR for the first time. Target product species H2 and CO2 are sequentially separated, so that their partial pressures are maintained close to their maxima at thermodynamic equilibrium to effectively drive methane conversion to full completion theoretically. The new principle enables a remarkable decrease in the SMR temperature and a dramatic reduction in energy penalties of separation in theory and practice. The effectiveness of the new principle and method is demonstrated by a proof-of-concept reactor with a Pd–Ag membrane and alternating nickel catalyst/hydrotalcite sorbent combinations. High-purity H2 and CO2 are directly obtained with >99% conversion of methane and >99% yield and selectivity of H2 and CO2 under mild conditions of 400 °C and 1 bar. Fast and stable production of H2 and CO2 is demonstrated over 6000 cycles. The highly compact reactor and mild operating conditions further enable integration with a parabolic trough solar collector, by which mid-temperature solar thermochemical H2 production and CO2 capture are achieved. The solar-to-H2 efficiency is 3.4% with direct solar illumination. The efficiency can be enhanced to 46.5% or above with solar thermal energy storage and advances in mid-/low-temperature SMR catalysts and CO2 sorbents, and can be further enhanced to beyond 60% with low-energy-penalty separation technologies.

Broader context
Decarbonization of the fossil fuel-dominant energy system has become a pressing demand for mitigating the global climate change. Natural gas (methane) currently accounts for ∼25% of global energy consumption and is expected to play an increasingly important role during the transition, owing to its lowest carbon content among all primary fuels. Solar energy is the most abundant renewable energy with tremendous potential to such end as well, but massive and economical storage of solar energy has remained a prominent challenge. Hydrogen derivation from solar-driven steam methane reforming (SMR) could, in principle, address the storage challenge of solar energy and provide an attractive approach for sustainable and cost-effective H2 production. But state-of-the-art solar SMR technology faces multiple key barriers, including high temperature, relatively low methane conversion, undesirable H2 selectivity, and additional equipment and energy requirement for gas separation. In this study, we propose a new principle of multi-product sequential separation to effectively address all such challenges, and demonstrate the integration of SMR with a parabolic trough solar collector (the most commercialized solar thermal technology) for the direct production of high-purity H2 and CO2 under mild conditions. The findings might also indicate broad opportunities and great potentials of CO2 emission reduction through the synergistic integration of SMR with a spectrum of other heat sources, such as industrial waste heat.

Hydrogen is regarded as a prospective carrier for renewable energy and a cornerstone of the global energy transition, due primarily to its exceptional energy density, cleanliness and wide applications.1–3 So far, hydrogen is almost completely produced from fossil fuels, among which about 76% is accounted for by natural gas but less than 1% by renewable energy.4,5 In conjunction with the growth of renewable energy, natural gas is expected to serve as a “bridge fuel” by the progressive substitution of coal and oil for decarbonization of the energy system.6 But studies have shown that the abundance of natural gas (e.g., the boom of shale gas) might actually compete with renewable energy sources, such as solar energy and wind energy, and delay the transition in the absence of right approaches for them to work in synergy.7,8 Steam methane reforming (SMR), the primary reaction of H2 production from natural gas, is a strongly endothermic process conventionally operated at high temperatures (>800 °C). The intensive heat demand, typically provided by the combustion of 3–20% of the natural gas feedstock, could be substituted by solar energy by means of concentrated solar heat9 or (solar) electrical resistive heating.10,11 Such solar-driven processes are expected to substantially cut the CO2 emission of the derived H2 by 17–41%.10 Solar-driven SMR ideally stores solar energy by 28% of the calorific value of methane converted,12 which could significantly decrease the carbon footprint of hydrogen and potentially enable large-scale solar energy storage with simultaneous decarbonization of natural gas on a vast scale.
Concentrated solar energy (CSE)-driven methane reforming has been a subject of solar fuel research for decades, and has been demonstrated from laboratory scale to pilot scale.13–17 It ideally affords high solar-to-fuel efficiencies due to the conversion of the entire solar spectrum to supply heat for the reaction. Research efforts mainly focus on solar receivers/reactors,9,15,18,19 catalyst bed structures20–22 and novel cycling approaches23–27 for improving conversion performance and reducing temperatures. As SMR is generally considered as a high-temperature (e.g., 800–1000 °C) reaction, the most commercially developed parabolic trough solar collectors28,29 are regarded unsuitable for solar SMR, since the temperature range (<550 °C) is too low to attain meaningful methane conversion.30 Parabolic dish and tower solar collectors can meet the required temperature range and are usually considered practical choices.16,31 But reactor stability issues related to the high temperature, daily heating/cooling and transient variation in solar illumination are considered as critical barriers against solar SMR proceeding from pilot-scale demonstration to commercialization.32 While solar SMR reactors may exhibit kinetic advantages over industrial ones due to direct solar illumination, their temperature range (>800 °C) and reaction products (synthesis gas, i.e., a mixture of H2 and CO) are essentially the same, so that challenges of conventional SMR, including high operation temperature, complexity of system, and high energy penalties for product separation remain. Therefore, the feasibility of direct H2 production by conventional CSE-driven SMR still appears rather remote.
Process intensification of methane reforming, such as separation-enhanced SMR based on Le Chatelier's principle, has been an attractive means of reducing SMR reaction temperature, deriving H2 and separating CO2.33–41 Considerably higher methane conversion (60–90%) is attainable at lower reaction temperatures (400–700 °C) as compared with separation-free SMR.36,40,42–45 But studies so far are primarily limited to the separation of single products of either H2 or CO2, for which the partial pressure decreases as methane conversion enhances, resulting in a conflict between primary objectives of high conversion and low energy penalty of separation. Such critical conflict makes it highly challenging to further decrease the operation temperature and simplify the SMR processes, so that the feasibility of integrating the process-intensified SMR with CSE for H2 production is unclear. Also, the regeneration of CO2 sorbents (e.g., CaO) often requires temperatures considerably higher than those of the sorption-enhanced SMR (SE-SMR) reaction (e.g., >750 °C for decomposing CaCO3 to CaO),37,38,40,46 posing additional barriers against the integration with CSE.
In this study, a new principle and method of sequential separation is proposed to achieve near-complete CH4 conversion under mild conditions (∼400 °C and ambient pressure) for H2 production and CO2 capture47 driven by CSE. A prototype reactor was constructed and is illustrated in Fig. 1A. Different from the successive “reformer-heat exchanger-shift reactor-H2 purifier” layout of industrial SMR, the reactor houses nickel SMR catalyst and hydrotalcite CO2 sorbent48 arranged in an alternating fashion to sequentially separate H2 and CO2. For each set of the catalyst-sorbent combination, H2 is generated by the SMR reaction (1)over the Ni-based catalyst, which also works well for catalyzing the water–gas-shift (WGS) reaction in the temperature range of 350–450 °C49,50 for additional H2 generation, (2)

(C) Methane conversion rate between 250 °C and 425 °C at different pumping pressures for H2 separation. (D) Comparison of the methane conversion rate of this work with those of the state-of-the-art approaches of solar-driven (solid symbols) and non-solar-driven (open symbols) SMR versus reaction temperature (literature data notation format: reference number, institution, year).13,14,36,42–45,51–66 
This temperature range favors the WGS reaction, so that the generation of CO is suppressed, but the thermodynamics of the SMR reaction also dictates a low conversion of CH4 (e.g., 10–35%). The H2 produced by reactions (1) and (2) is separated by a hydrogen permeation membrane, and the CO2 produced is thus adsorbed by the hydrotalcite sorbent in the range of 200–450 °C, and can be isothermally regenerated by a pressure swing with lower CO2 partial pressure and relatively low energy penalties.48 The conversion of CH4 can be progressively escalated to near 100% by sequentially separating both H2 and CO2 in each catalyst-absorbent set and employing a sufficiently large number of such sets. The global reaction can be expressed as follows (by superimposing reactions (1) and (2)), with the corresponding theoretical selectivity for H2 and CO2 being 100%: (3)
It has to be noted that the employment of the Ni-based catalyst and hydrotalcite sorbent is mainly for the purpose of demonstrating the feasibility and effectiveness of the sequential separation-driven SMR. However, the applicability of the sequential separation principle and the corresponding SMR method is not limited to the choice of such materials. For example, noble metal SMR catalyst (Fig. S1, ESI†) and Li4SiO4 sorbent (with 13–20 times higher CO2 capacity) could be expected to significantly enhance the performance metrics than those demonstrated in this study.67
The prototype reactor consisted of a Pd–Ag membrane (3 μm in thickness, 380 mm in length) supported on a porous α-Al2O3 tube (30–35% porosity, 10 mm in inner diameter, 12 mm in outer diameter, with one blind end), interconnected with a concentric stainless steel enclosure (30 mm in inner diameter, 5 mm in wall thickness) by a gas-tight flange. A total of 6 sets of catalyst-sorbent combination filled the annular space between the tube and the enclosure. Each set consisted of a packed bed of commercial Ni/MgO–Al2O3 SMR catalyst (5.8 g, 1.9–2.4 mm in diameter, 8 mm in bed height) and a packed bed of 20 wt% K2CO3 promoted γ-alumina/Mg6Al2CO3(OH)16 hydrotalcite CO2 sorbent (21.7 g, 0.8–1.9 mm in diameter, 55 mm in bed height) in sequence. The amounts of catalyst and sorbent and their bed heights were determined based on material properties, reactor volume, reaction temperature, methane flow rate and cycling control strategy parameters. The reactor was operated in the uniformly heated zone (450 mm in length) of a tubular electric furnace and maintained at each target temperature between 250 °C and 425 °C (bed temperature) for measurements under ambient pressure. The nickel catalyst was pre-reduced by H2 for 4 h. Adsorbed CO2 in hydrotalcite, if any, was desorbed and swept out by flowing He at 400 °C for 4 h. A mixture of CH4, H2O and Ar (Ar was used as the internal standard gas of the mass spectrometer for quantitative measurement of effluent gas) with steam-to-methane ratio of 4:1 was preheated to 200 °C and fed into the reactor from the inlet, and more H2O than needed by stoichiometry (reaction (3)) was used for the prevention of carbon deposition over the nickel catalyst (Fig. S2, ESI†).
The evolution of CH4 to target products of H2 and CO2 was first examined. The flow rate of CH4 was set to 60 mL min−1 (standard temperature and pressure, STP), and sequential separation of H2 and CO2 was performed in a cyclic fashion. The reactor was first heated to 425 °C and then ramped down by every 25 °C. Experimental runs and measurements were performed at each temperature isothermally after the temperature stabilized for 30 min, when the CH4/H2O feed started flowing into the annular space of the reactor. At each temperature, the Pd–Ag membrane tube was pumped from its interior side at 2000, 4000 and 8000 Pa, and H2 was observed immediately on the pumping side as CH4 and H2O were fed into the reactor. In this study, the pumping pressures of >0.01 bar (i.e., 1000 Pa) correspond to a high efficiency range of >10%, in contrast to pumping pressures of <10−3 bar and the corresponding pump efficiency range of <1%.68 During this process, the removal of H2 simultaneously resulted in the increase of the CO2 partial pressure, so that CO2 was adsorbed by the hydrotalcite sorbent with enhanced thermodynamic driving force. When the hydrotalcite sorbent in all the sets was saturated, the CO2 level in the exhaust exiting the reactor showed a sudden increase from a volumetric concentration of 1%. The reactor was then purged by flowing helium (1.0 L min−1, STP; replaceable by steam in practical applications) to desorb CO2 from the sorbent. Based on the thermogravimetric adsorption/desorption curves of the CO2 sorbent (Fig. S3, ESI†), the periods of H2 and CO2 separation were optimized to be 1.5 min and 9.0 min, respectively. A dwelling period of 1.0 min was added between the two steps (i.e., reaction and purge) with continuous hydrogen separation until a recovery of >95% theoretical hydrogen yield (by reaction (3)) was reached (details in Table S1, ESI†).
The evolution profiles of H2 (separation pressure 2000 Pa) and CO2 are shown in Fig. 1B. The production rate of H2 increased sharply and peaked at 221 mL min−1 (STP). The production rate of CO2 remained at a low level of 1.8 mL min−1 (STP) when H2 was produced, and gradually increased to 17.7 mL min−1 (STP) during helium purging. The two curves appear to overlap temporally, but the corresponding species were apart spatially, as H2 exited from the open end of the Pd–Ag membrane tube, while all other species exited from the reactor outlet (Fig. 1A). The physical separation of H2 and CO2 ensured that both products could be collected in their high-purity form. The single-pass conversion of CH4 reached 97–99% at 425 °C and 91–99% at 400 °C (Fig. 1C), while it decreased rapidly at temperatures below 400 °C. This features the highest methane conversion rate and the lowest reaction temperature as compared with other SMR approaches in the literature (Fig. 1D). In particular, our results are compared with previous studies on process-intensified SMR approaches in Fig. 1D. To achieve the same range of methane conversion, our method requires temperatures 120–250 °C lower than those of the SE-SMR approach, and 80–150 °C lower than those of the SMR with hydrogen permeation membrane (HPM) approach, on the basis of an average temperature of 450–500 °C for both categories. The temperature difference was enlarged by an additional ∼50 °C when noble metal SMR catalyst (i.e., Ru) was used (Fig. S1, ESI†), corresponding to a decrease in the reaction temperature by up to 235–290 °C as compared with studies with similar catalysts and sorbents for the same range of methane conversions.45 The hydrogen yield was 99.58% (including 94.46% for H2 collected on the permeate side, and 5.12% for H2 in the exhaust from the reforming side), and the CO2 yield was 99.53% (based on 0.41 mol% of CH4 and 0.06 mol% of CO in the exhaust of the reforming side). The selectivity of H2 was >99%, since there was no other detectable product species that contains H (other than radicals that were neglected); the selectivity of CO2 was 99.94%. The as-collected H2 on the permeate side had a purity of >99.99 mol% owing to the gastight Pd–Ag membrane, and the purity of the as-collected CO2 on the reforming side was 82.62 mol% (with 16.99 mol% of H2, 0.34 mol% of CH4 and 0.046 mol% of CO, excluding He). The impurities in CO2 were residual H2 and CH4 that remained in the reactor chamber while helium flushing was abruptly switched on, which could be eliminated by optimizing the separation strategy, or be isothermally and catalytically converted69,70 to obtain high-purity (>99 mol%) CO2 (after H2O condensation).
In order to understand the fundamental reasons for the high conversion of CH4 at significantly reduced temperatures, thermodynamic analysis was performed on both the single separation of H2 (as in conventional membrane-promoted SMR,36,42Fig. 2A) and the sequential separation of both H2 and CO2 in this work (Fig. 2B). The results show that sequential bi-product separation is thermodynamically advantaged over single-product separation with a significantly lower energy penalty at sufficiently high CH4 conversions. For SMR and WGS reactions, conventional single separation of H2 (typically via a membrane, Fig. 2A) enhances the extent of the reaction by monotonically decreasing the partial pressure of H2 (Fig. 2C). Therefore, the ideal work of single-product separation, (4)increases in an exponential-growth-like fashion as H2 is continually separated (Fig. 2D), where P1 is the separation pressure of H2. In contrast, sequential bi-product separation of H2 and CO2 (Fig. 2B) can avoid the fast growth of separation work at a high extent of the reaction by separating one species (e.g., H2) to a high enough reaction extent (e.g., 0.8), and then switching to the separation of the other species (e.g., CO2) likewise (Fig. 2E), so that the conversion of CH4 could be theoretically driven to completion with significantly lower work of separation. Thus, the separation of two target species in a sequential manner equivalently allows an even lower reaction temperature (and partial pressure of targeted species at equilibrium) of SMR as compared with single-product separation enhanced SMR (and also conventional SMR without product separation), and yet can still drive the conversion of CH4 to completion. The ideal separation work of sequential bi-product separation-driven SMR, (5)can be significantly reduced as compared with that of single-product separation,71,72 where k stands for the total number of sets of catalyst-sorbent combination, and i stands for the sequence number of a given set for separation, and P2 and P3 are the separation pressure of H2 and CO2, respectively. The work of separation derived by eqn (5) only considers species that are physically separated from the system, i.e., H2 and CO2, that incur separation work. To achieve an extent of SMR reaction up to 0.99 at 400 °C, the separation work of H2 and CO2 with sequential separation is 26.96 kJ mol−1, which is 43% lower than that of single separation of H2 (47.60 kJ mol−1) (Fig. 2F, ESI†).

In order to further understand the H2 production process and enhanced conversion of CH4, a reacting flow model is developed to simulate the gas flow, catalytic reactions, mass transfer, H2 permeation and CO2 adsorption processes in the reactor and interprete experimental results (ESI†). Simulation of the experimental data in Fig. 1B shows that the six catalyst-sorbent sets work in a relay fashion but contribute unequally to the conversion of CH4. Within the span of each set, the permeated H2 profile through the Pd–Ag membrane shows a sharp peak to start with, followed by a decrease within the catalyst and sorbent sections. The permeation flux of H2 reached a remarkable rate of 9.9 mL cm−2 min−1 (STP) at the reactor inlet (i.e., Pd–Ag membrane tube outlet), and the first set contributes the highest portion of 30.2% of the total amount of H2 produced by the whole reactor (Fig. S4A, ESI†). The height of H2 peaks then decreases monotonically along the flow direction. The first set also contributes the highest CH4 conversion of 32.8% over its catalyst bed, considerably higher than the theoretical value of 24.4% at thermodynamic equilibrium without separation. Such behaviors result from the highest partial pressure and flow rate of CH4 at the reactor inlet, both of which decrease along the flow direction. The CO2 adsorption capacity of hydrotalcite remained between 0.29 mol kg−1 and 0.53 mol kg−1, and the second set contributes the highest portion of 23.9% of the total amount of CO2 captured by the whole reactor (Fig. S4B, ESI†). As the CO2 sorbent does not catalyze CH4 conversion (Fig. S14, ESI†), the conversion rate of CH4 shows a stepwise escalation to 99.9%, with the CH4 flow and conversion profiles staying flat within the CO2 sorbent bed regions (Fig. S4C, ESI†). The cumulative production curve of H2 along the reactor shows a similar but slightly different trend due to the permeation of H2 over the entire span of each set. Despite the decreasing trend in the absolute CH4 conversion increment along the flow direction, the model reveals that the relative CH4 conversion (i.e., the amount of CH4 converted in each set divided by the amount of CH4 available at the beginning of each set) actually increases along the reactor. This is partially due to the steam being in an increasingly higher excess relative to methane along the flow direction of the reactor, as H2O and CH4 are fed into the reactor at a 4:1 ratio but are only consumed at a 2:1 stoichiometric ratio (reaction (3)). The relative conversion rate of CH4 in each set increases from 32.8% to 99.4% (Fig. S4D, ESI†), far exceeding the theoretical maximum at local equilibrium without separation, due to the sequential separation of H2O and CO2.
To demonstrate the potential of the new methodology for practical applications, durability of the sequential separation process of H2 and CO2 was examined by subjecting the reactor to thermochemical cycles for long-term operation. By the correlation between CH4 conversion and operating parameters, and considering the compatibility of the cycling strategy with mid-temperature solar collectors, the experiments were performed isothermally at 400 °C (bed temperature), with a CH4 flow rate of 100 mL min−1 (STP) and a H2 separation pressure of 5000 Pa (more parameters are shown in Table S2, ESI†). For a cycling strategy of “1 min reaction + 1 min dwelling + 2 min purge”, H2 productivity of 349.74 ± 4.76 mL per cycle (at STP), CO2 productivity of 95.37 ± 6.63 mL per cycle (at STP) and H2:CO2 ratio of 3.89 ± 0.24:1 were obtained over 6000 consecutive runs (Fig. 3). The average conversion rate of CH4 was 95.41%, and the average hydrogen yield was 94.62 ± 1.27% (including 87.43 ± 1.19% for H2 recovered on the permeate side, and 7.19 ± 0.19% for H2 in the exhaust from the reforming side). The H2:CO2 ratio agreed reasonably well with the mass balance as dictated by reaction (3), and the error was due to the residual H2 that was not pumped out of the reactor chamber. Post-run scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy examinations (Fig. S5–S7, ESI†) showed no sintering or carbon deposition with the Ni catalyst. The hydrotalcite sorbent only showed minor changes in the microstructure, and degradation of its CO2 adsorption/desorption performance was not obvious either. The excellent stability of the thermochemical cycle could be primarily attributed to the dramatic decrease in operating temperature (by a magnitude of 400–600 °C as compared with industrial SMR) and isothermal operation at mild temperature and pressure conditions. The impacts of the operating temperature and strategy on the materials' structure and mechanical stress of the reactor are thus minimized.

(A) Gas evolution profiles of 10 selected cycles; the numbers shown over each peak stand for the production of H2 (red curve) or CO2 (blue curve) per cycle in mL at STP. (B) Stability of gas production and H2/CO2 ratio over 6000 cycles. The flow rate of CH4 feed is 100 mL min−1 (STP) and the steam-to-methane ratio is 4:1. The average CH4 conversion rate is 95.41%. 
The new method of sequential separation-driven SMR not only decreases the temperature of hydrogen production to the range of 400 °C or below, but also achieves the combined functions of the SMR reactor, the water–gas-shift reactor, the pressure swing adsorption unit and the CO2 absorption unit (as in industrial SMR approaches) with one small and compact reactor, directly converting CH4 to high-purity H2 and CO2 with >99% conversion (of CH4), yield and selectivity (of H2 and CO2), respectively. Such distinctive features thus enable the integration with a parabolic trough solar collector (Fig. 4A) for solar thermochemical H2 production and CO2 capture via solar thermal sequential separation-driven SMR. A solar reactor was set up in a parabolic trough solar collector with a 2.55 m aperture and a steel receiver tube (38 mm in inner diameter, 40 mm in outer diameter, with an evacuated glass envelope on the exterior; Fig. 4B and C). The Pd–Ag membrane tube was wrapped by a stainless steel mesh (38 mm in outer diameter) that housed the same six sets of Ni/MgO–Al2O3 catalyst and hydrotalcite sorbent combination as those used in the previous reactor (Fig. S8, ESI†). The amounts of catalyst and sorbent in each set were also identical to those in the previous reactor, respectively. The assembly of the membrane tube, catalyst beds, sorbent beds and stainless steel mesh was inserted into the solar receiver tube, aligned coaxially with the tube, and sealed with the tube by a gastight flange. The receiver tube was mounted to the focal line of the parabolic trough concentrating mirror, and was illuminated by the quasi-collimated light of an in-house universal solar simulator73 at an energy flux of 160.4 ± 12.5 W m−2 (Table S3, ESI†) and a total power of 0.163 kW (maximum 1.0 kW). The solar reactor was heated up by concentrated solar energy at a rate of 4–5 °C min−1 and stabilized at 399.7 ± 4.5 °C (Table S4, ESI†) with the maximum temperature variation across the reactor being 8.7 °C. The performance of the solar reactor was measured with almost the same setting as that for the durability test, except that the dwelling period was extended to 3 min (Table S5, ESI† and Fig. 4D). For a period of 6 hours, typical of solar illumination during a day, a total of 100 cycles were performed. The H2 and CO2 productivities were 334.86 ± 4.20 mL min−1 (STP) and 90.97 ± 2.24 mL min−1 (STP) per cycle, respectively. The gas productivity and cycling stability were both very close to those of the long-term durability runs. Fig. 4D shows 10 selected cycles, and the numbers shown over each peak stand for the production of H2 or CO2 per cycle in mL at STP, respectively. The mild temperature range of ∼ 400 °C also indicates an indirectly heated solar sequential separation-driven SMR system design (Fig. 4E), in which the heat transfer fluid can be heated up by a parabolic trough solar collector and stored in a tank to supply dispatchable solar thermal energy for uninterrupted or on-demand sequential separation-driven H2 generation. The advantages are further analyzed below.

(D) Gas evolution profiles of 10 selected thermochemical cycles of the solar reactor. Operation conditions: bed temperature of 400 °C, total pressure of 1 bar, CH4 flow rate of 100 mL min−1 (STP) and H2 separation pressure of 2000 Pa. (E) Illustration of an indirectly solar-heated sequential separation-driven SMR reactor integrated with a parabolic trough solar collector with solar thermal energy storage. 
The thermochemical (i.e., thermal energy to chemical energy) efficiency of the sequential separation driven SMR reaction is defined as (6)where nH2 and nCO are the molar amounts of H2 and CO produced, respectively, and nCH4 is the net amount of methane consumed correspondingly; ΔHH2, ΔHCO and ΔHCH4 are the higher heating values of H2, CO and CH4, respectively; Qinput is the direct thermal energy input required to drive the conversion of nCH4 amount of CH4 to H2 and CO2 by reaction (3); Wpenalty is the separation work for both H2 and CO2, and ηth-ele is thermal-to-electric conversion efficiency. For an ideal conversion process from CH4 to H2 and CO2 by reaction (3), Qinput includes both the enthalpy change of the reaction and the thermal energy input required to heat both CH4 and H2O to the reaction temperature, while ηth-ele is taken as the Carnot efficiency corresponding to the reaction temperature. Thus, for the sequential separation-driven SMR reaction at 400 °C, the maximum thermochemical efficiency is 73.2%. For practical applications, however, the Qinput term has to take various heat losses (e.g., conduction, convection) into account, while the Wpenalty term must consider the efficiency of pumping and gas separation devices. For operation with solar thermal energy input, due to the dramatic decrease in the operating temperature of methane conversion, solar thermal energy of 400 °C and below can be stored with molten salt or thermal oil and drive the chemical reactions continuously with negligible heat loss (Fig. 4E). The maximum thermochemical (i.e., solar-to-chemical) efficiency for such scenarios is 46.5%, with the difference from the maximum thermochemical efficiency being primarily accounted for by energy penalties due to heat transfer energy losses, pumping and gas separation. For the CH4 conversion driven by direct solar illumination in this work, radiative heat loss from the solar receiver tube to the ambient becomes the dominant form of energy loss relative to the losses above. The solar-to-chemical efficiency, based on measurements of solar energy flux, is determined as 3.4% (detailed calculations of the efficiencies are given in the ESI†).
In addition, the sequential separation-driven SMR reactor indicates a considerable simplification in system design and a significant decrease in device size as compared with state-of-the-art industrial facilities for deriving hydrogen from methane (Table S7, ESI†).10 The industrial approach requires multiple units including the SMR reactor, the water–gas-shift reactor, the pressure swing adsorption unit, the CO2 absorption unit and heat exchangers to derive high-purity hydrogen. For the same H2 production rate of 50 m3 h−1 (STP), the size of the industrial SMR reactor is 1140 m3,10 while that of the sequential separation-driven SMR reactor based on this work is only 1.9–2.5% of the former (21.75–28.45 m3), with spaces between reactor tubes for heat transfer fluid being taken into consideration (Table S7, ESI†).74 The simplicity and compactness of the reactor are crucial for direct, solar thermal-driven H2 derivation. The great simplification of the SMR process and miniaturization of the reactor further indicate that H2 could be generated in a decentralized manner close to end users, cutting on transportation expenses of H2. Technoeconomic analysis (Table S8, ESI†) shows that the levelized cost of hydrogen produced by the upgraded sequential separation-driven SMR system could reach 1.13 $ kg−1-H2, which might be more competitive over that of industrial SMR with carbon capture (1.24 $ kg−1-H2).75
In summary, this work proposes a novel approach for the thermochemical derivation of low-carbon-footprint H2via steam meathane reforming. The new principle of sequential separation enables near-complete conversion of methane and direct attainment of high-purity H2 and CO2 at their maximum yield (i.e., >99%) and selectivity (i.e., >99%) with the combination of mild temperature (400 °C), pressure (1 bar) and commercially available non-noble metal SMR catalyst and CO2 sorbent. Compared with conventional SMR approaches for H2 derivation, the temperature of methane reforming is dramatically reduced by up to 400–600 °C, and separation work is significantly reduced by more than 40%. The key findings of this study significantly decrease reaction temperature, minimize catalyst sintering, remarkably enhance durability of methane reforming devices, enable compact reactor design and considerable simplification of SMR-based hydrogen production system, and further enable integration with mid-temperature solar thermal technologies (e.g., parabolic trough solar collectors, operating temperature <550 °C).31 In this temperature range, influences of the intermittency of solar irradiation on the reactor can also be effectively eliminated by solar thermal energy storage via molten salt or thermal oil (Fig. 4E). Thus, the new approach as proposed in this study shall make efficient and 24 h continuous production of H2 possible on the basis of large-scale collection and cost-effective storage capabilities of solar thermal energy technologies. Challenges in H2 storage and transport could also be substantially mitigated by decentralized and on-demand production of H2 based on this approach, taking advantage of mature mid-temperature solar thermal storage technologies and readily available natural gas infrastructures. The isothermal operation of the sequential separation-driven methane conversion under mild conditions brings additional benefits in reactor design and lifetime. The capture of high-purity CO2 with low energy penalty provides sufficient possibilities of CO2 utilization and fixation via chemical and electrochemical routes. For example, recent progress in electrolytic cells based on ceramic proton conductor materials76 offers possibilities of replacing the precious metal (i.e., Pd–Ag) membrane by cost-effective ceramic membrane, and indicates further integration with solar photovoltaic-driven electrochemical separation. While the experimentally demonstrated solar-to-H2 efficiency is 3.4% for direct, on-sun operation, efficiencies of up to 46.5% are practically achievable (Table S21, ESI†) with the integration of solar thermal energy storage and advances in mid-/low-temperature SMR catalysts and CO2 sorbents. The efficiency could further increase to more than 60% if the mechanical pumping work could, in addition, be dramatically reduced (e.g., by half) by more advanced separation approaches.

Broader context
Decarbonization of the fossil fuel-dominant energy system has become a pressing demand for mitigating the global climate change. Natural gas (methane) currently accounts for ∼25% of global energy consumption and is expected to play an increasingly important role during the transition, owing to its lowest carbon content among all primary fuels. Solar energy is the most abundant renewable energy with tremendous potential to such end as well, but massive and economical storage of solar energy has remained a prominent challenge. Hydrogen derivation from solar-driven steam methane reforming (SMR) could, in principle, address the storage challenge of solar energy and provide an attractive approach for sustainable and cost-effective H2 production. But state-of-the-art solar SMR technology faces multiple key barriers, including high temperature, relatively low methane conversion, undesirable H2 selectivity, and additional equipment and energy requirement for gas separation. In this study, we propose a new principle of multi-product sequential separation to effectively address all such challenges, and demonstrate the integration of SMR with a parabolic trough solar collector (the most commercialized solar thermal technology) for the direct production of high-purity H2 and CO2 under mild conditions. The findings might also indicate broad opportunities and great potentials of CO2 emission reduction through the synergistic integration of SMR with a spectrum of other heat sources, such as industrial waste heat.
