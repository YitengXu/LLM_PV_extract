    , Accepted 16th July 2021First published on 17th July 2021AbstractThe electronic structures and optical properties of a novel class of hybrid binary Janus materials derived from IV–V groups were investigated using first principles calculations. The computational results demonstrated that, except for Ge2NAs, all the other five structures of M2XY monolayers (M = Si, Ge; X, Y = N, P, As; X ≠ Y) have excellent thermal and dynamical stabilities. Janus Si2NP, Si2NAs, Si2PAs and Ge2NP are semiconductors with direct band gaps spanning the range between 0.82 and 2.49 eV. Notably, the hybrid M2XY materials exhibit highly efficient absorption within the visible light region, which are greatly higher than their pristine MX structures. Janus Si2PAs and Ge2PAs possess appropriate band edge alignments that straddle the water redox potentials in the pH range from 0 to 14, making them promising photocatalysts for water splitting under visible light. Our calculations further demonstrate that the catalytic selectivity for the water splitting reaction could be achieved through the hybrid Janus M2XY, where, for instance, Ge2NP appears to facilitate only the oxidation, but not the reduction of water under certain conditions. This outcome provides a new route for the design of novel photocatalysts with improved efficiency and selectivity.
1. Introduction
Two-dimensional (2D) materials have recently emerged as a new generation of advanced functional materials due to their extraordinary chemical and physical properties.1–3 Many 2D materials such as graphene,4,5 black phosphorene (BP),6 transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs),7–9 layered group-III metal chalcogenides,10,11etc. have demonstrated properties that can overcome the limitations of current electronic devices and therefore broaden their applications. IV–V layered materials MX (M = Si, Ge; X = P, As) have received increasing attention very recently due to their anisotropic behavior and photocatalytic activity.12 Devices constructed with these 2D layered materials (e.g. SiP, GeP and GeAs) have exhibited promising potential for anisotropy optoelectronic and photocatalytic applications.13–17 Theoretical studies have demonstrated that MX have moderate band gaps, high carrier mobilities (∼103), and large spectral responses in the visible light region and have appropriate band edge positions for facilitating water photosplitting.18–23 There are few studies on the binary MX materials from IV–V groups (e.g., Si2N2). To the best of our knowledge, there is no report on the investigation of hybrid binary M2XY monolayers, although it is well documented that hybridization may result in new chemical and physical properties.
In 2017, Lu et al.24 successfully synthesized ML Janus MoSSe by replacing the S top-layer with Se atoms in ML MoS2. Different from pristine MoS2, the broken symmetry of ML Janus MoSSe induces novel properties and applications due to changes of the electronic structures. For example, Hu et al.25 reported that the Rashba-type spin splitting around the Γ point of Janus MoSSe could be enhanced by external electric fields and compressive strain, indicating that the Janus MoSSe has potential applications in valleytronics and spintronics. Jin et al.26 carried out theoretical studies on the adsorption of CO, CO2, NH3, NO and NO2 molecules on the Se or S side of ML Janus MoSSe. Their calculation shows that the presence of out-of-plane polarization makes these molecules generally tend towards the Se side than the S side. Particularly, NH3 molecules adopt distinct opposite orientations absorbing on the Se and S sides. The high gas sensitivity makes Janus MoSSe a candidate for constructing ultrahigh-sensitivity nanoscale sensors. Inspired by Janus MoSSe, more and more 2D Janus nanomaterials have been explored in the last several years, such as transition metals27 and their dichalcogenides,28–31 transition-metal halides32,33 and MXenes.34 Theoretical investigations have shown that these Janus nanostructures have the desired properties for potential applications in photocatalysis and piezoelectric devices.
Chen et al.28 recently proposed new Janus materials MXY (M = Ti, Zr, or Hf; X = S or Se; Y = O or S; X ≠ Y) based on transition-metal oxides and chalcogenides. These MXY Janus materials have been demonstrated to have moderate band gaps, suitable band edge positions, optimal redox potentials and high carrier mobilities. Idrees et al.31 conducted a comprehensive study by first-principles calculations about the electronic structure, effective mass, work function, and photocatalytic performance of Janus MXY (M = Mo, W; X, Y = S, Se, Te) monolayers. Among them, Janus WSeTe, MoSTe and WSTe show excellent absorption efficiencies (80–90%) in the visible, infra-red and ultraviolet regions, with which their potential solar cell applications could be expected. Zhang et al.29 designed novel Janus SnXY monolayers (X/Y = O, S, Se, Te; X ≠ Y) and found their great piezoelectric properties. In particular, SnOSe was demonstrated to possess the largest in-plane piezoelectric coefficient of 27.3 pm V−1, which is one order of magnitude greater than those of previously reported fashionable piezoelectric materials. The studies mentioned above suggest that the formation of Janus structures with a broken symmetry represents an effective way to prepare 2D materials with novel chemical and physical properties.
MX (M = Si, Ge; X = P, As) monolayers are centrosymmetric 2D materials, which inspires us to speculate that hybrid binary MX 2D Janus structures may possess new interesting physical and chemical properties. In this work, the structural, electronic and photocatalytic properties of Janus M2XY (M = Si, Ge; X, Y = N, P, As; X ≠ Y) monolayers have been systematically investigated by first-principles calculations. The computational results indicate that the Si2NP, Si2NAs, Si2PAs, Ge2NP and Ge2PAs monolayers are dynamically and thermally stable. These five Janus monolayers have moderate band gaps of 0.82–2.49 eV. Except Ge2PAs, the other four novel Janus structures all have direct band gaps. Notably, they have large light absorption coefficients within the visible light region, which are even higher than those of their pristine MX form, making them promising candidates for photocatalysis. The proposed Janus materials possess appropriate band edge positions for the oxidation and reduction of water over a broad pH range.
2. Methods
In this study, first-principles calculations were performed using the density functional theory (DFT) with projector-augmented wave (PAW) potentials implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) to study the electronic structures.35–37 Generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional is always adopted for exchange–correlation energy.38 The Herd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof hybrid functional (HSE06) was employed to calculate the band structures more accurately.39 The spin–orbit coupling (SOC) was considered for the heavy elements Ge and As, and the band structures of Janus Si2NAs, Si2PAs, Ge2NP and Ge2PAs were calculated at the PBE + SOC level of theory. For all geometric optimizations and electronic structure calculations, the energy cutoff of the plane-wave basis was set to 500 eV. The Monkhorst–Pack k-point grid scheme with 3 × 17 × 1 and 5 × 27 × 1 was used for the relaxation and calculations of electronic properties, respectively. A vacuum thickness of 15 Å was employed along the z direction to avoid the influence of interlayer interactions. For all these calculations, the convergence criteria of energy and Hellmann–Feynman forces for the structural relaxation were set to be less than 10−5 eV and 0.01 eV Å−1, respectively. The valence electron configurations of N, Si, P, Ge and As atoms are 2s22p3, 3s23p2, 3s23p3, 4s24p2 and 4s24p3, respectively. Dipole correction was considered to remove the influence of intrinsic electric dipole moment on the calculations of electrostatic potentials. The band gap center (BCG)40 was calculated according to the plane-averaged electrostatic potentials at the PBE level of theory, and the band alignments of the VBM and CBM are determined by the following equations:  Here EVBM refers to the energy of the VBM, ECBM refers to the energy of the CBM, EBGC refers to the BGC energy calculated at the PBE level of theory, and Eg refers to the band gaps calculated at the HSE06 level of theory.
Due to 3D periodic boundary conditions, for these 2D Janus materials, their elastic constants C2Dij were calculated by multiplying C3Dij by the length of the unit cell along the z direction,41 where C3Dij were calculated directly using VASP according to the strain–stress relationship.42
Phonon dispersion spectra were calculated by the finite displacement method implemented in the PHONOPY code43 with a 1 × 6 × 1 supercell sheet. The thermal stabilities in a 1 × 5 × 1 supercell were investigated by performing ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations using VASP software with a time step of 1 fs. All the AIMD simulations lasted for 5 ps at the room temperature of 300 K with the Nosé heating bath scheme.44 The carrier effective masses were calculated using the formula m* = ℏ(∂2E/∂k2)−1, where E is the energy eigenvalue, k is the wave vector and ℏ is the reduced Planck constant. To evaluate the optical properties of these Janus materials, DFT calculations of frequency-dependent dielectric functions were performed using the HSE06 functional, where the imaginary part ε2(ω) of the dielectric function and the absorption coefficient α(ω) with a 600 eV cutoff were calculated using the Fermi golden rule,45 which can be expressed as  here, c and v refer to the states of the conduction and valence bands, respectively; μ and ω refer to the eigenstate with wave vector  and the k-point weight, respectively. The Kramers–Kronig transformation was used to obtain the real part of the dielectric tensor as follows:46  
Hence, we assessed the frequency-dependent absorption coefficient α(ω) using the real and imaginary parts of dielectric functions:47  
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Structures and stabilities
The Janus M2XY (M = Si, Ge; X, Y = N, P, As; X ≠ Y) monolayers with the space group of Cm are considered as derivatives of the pristine MX (M = Si, Ge; X = N, P, As) by replacing half of the X atoms with Y atoms. In this paper, the X of M2XY refers to the atoms with a lower electronegativity relative to Y. The top and side views of M2XY are presented in Fig. 1a. Each unit cell contains 12 M, 6 X and 6 Y atoms. The rectangular unit cell is defined by vectors a and b. More specifically, there are six M–M pairs in each unit cell, which are not connected with each other directly. Among them, four M–M pairs parallel to the z direction are coordinated with 3 X atoms on one side and with 3 Y atoms on the other side. The other two M–M pairs parallel to the x direction are coordinated with 2 X and 1 Y atoms on one side and 1 X atom and 2 Y atoms on the other side. These two kinds of M–M pairs make these Janus materials far from simple sandwich structures like MoS2. After full relaxation, the lattice constants and lattice structures of M2XY monolayers are shown in Table 1 and Fig. S1 (ESI†). According to the calculation results, the lattice constants of Janus M2XY monolayers are always larger than those of MX but smaller than those of MY. For example, the lattice constants of the ML Janus Si2NP are a = 18.548 Å and b = 3.209 Å, which are in between the lattice constants of ML SiN (a = 17.449 Å, b = 2.956 Å) and the lattice constants of ML SiP (a = 20.549 Å and b = 3.531 Å). The same trend has also been observed in other Janus materials, such as Janus PtSSe and MoSSe.48,49

The elastic properties of the Janus M2XY were analyzed to evaluate their mechanical stabilities. For these 2D materials with rectangular symmetry, there are four independent elastic constants (C2D11, C2D12, C2D22 and C2D66), and five stability criteria derived from Born–Huang's lattice dynamical theory50,51 have been used to judge their mechanical stabilities. The calculated elastic constants are listed in Table 2, from which it can be found out that these Janus structures are all mechanically stable. Moreover, the mechanical properties such as 2D Young's modulus E2D and Poisson's ratio ν2D were calculated according to the Voigt–Reuss–Hill approximation.52 As shown in Table 2, the E2D perpendicular to the x direction is always higher than the E2D parallel to the x direction, which can be ascribed to the strong directional bonding perpendicular to the x direction. Furthermore, the E2D of the Janus M2XY decreases with increasing atomic number, that is, E2D(Si2XY) > E2D(Ge2XY) and E2D(MNP) > E2D(MNAs) > E2D(MPAs). Thus, Si2NP appears to be the stiffest material among these proposed Janus M2XY. Compared to a previously reported study,53 Janus M2XY generally have higher Young's modulus values than their original materials, for example, E2Dx⊥(Si2NP) = 134.8 N m−1 and E2Dx‖ = 100.5 N m−1, while E2Dx⊥(SiP) = 100.4 N m−1 and E2Dx‖ = 77.2 N m−1.

The phonon dispersion spectra in the first Brillouin zone were calculated to investigate the dynamical stabilities of the Janus M2XY monolayers, as shown in Fig. 2 (left panels). In the spectrum of Janus Ge2NAs, an imaginary frequency mode appears at the X point (Fig. 2e), while for the other five Janus M2XY monolayers there is no imaginary phonon mode in the Brillouin zone, except for a very small pocket near the Γ point. This small pocket of instability in the flexural phonon branch is not a real physical effect, while it reveals the difficulty of numerical convergence in the flexural phonon branch for 2D materials.54 The above calculations suggest that the proposed Janus M2XY structures, except Ge2NAs, are dynamically stable.

The AIMD simulations were performed for a 1 × 5 × 1 supercell containing 120 atoms of the Janus M2XY monolayers. The time-dependent evolution of total potential energy and selected snapshots of these Janus nanostructures are shown in Fig. 2 (right panels). The total potential energy fluctuates smoothly with small amplitudes; neither bond breaking nor significant structural reconstruction occurs during the simulations. The simulation results suggest high thermal stabilities of these Janus M2XY monolayers.
3.2 Formation energy
To investigate the feasibility of experimental synthesis of the Janus M2XY monolayers proposed above, their formation energies (Ef) were calculated as follows:  EM2XY and EMX are the energies of the Janus M2XY monolayers and MX monolayers, respectively. EX and EY are the energies of X and Y (X, Y = N, P, As; X ≠ Y), respectively. EP and EAs are calculated from the energies of P and As in their solid phase, respectively. EN is half of the energy of N2. n (n = 24) denotes the number of atoms in the unit cell. As shown in Table 1, the calculated Ef values are all negative, which implies that the synthesis of the Janus M2XY monolayers is exothermic. These results lend positive support to the possibility of experimental realization of the Janus M2XY monolayers.55
3.3 Electronic properties
To explore their electronic properties, the band structures of the Janus M2XY monolayers based on both the PBE and HSE06 levels of theory were calculated. The results are shown in Fig. 3, which indicate that these Si2XY monolayers are all direct band gap semiconductors and their valence band maxima (VBMs) and conduction band minima (CBMs) are located at the Γ point. It is the same for pristine ML SiP and SiAs. The band gaps of ML Janus Si2NAs, Si2NP, and Si2PAs are 0.82 eV, 1.85 eV, and 2.49 eV, respectively, which are inversely proportional to the electronegativity difference between the X and Y atoms. The ML Janus Ge2NP has a direct band gap of 1.24 eV, similar to that of the Janus Si2XY monolayer. The ML Janus Ge2PAs possesses an indirect band gap of 2.16 eV, with the VBM located at the Γ point and the CBM located at the A point. This band structure is similar to that of pristine ML GeP. The atomic-orbital-projected band structures of the Janus M2XY were also calculated for detailed insight into these band structures (shown in Fig. 4). Based on Fig. 4(a) and (b), Si2NP and Si2NAs have very similar band structures but different band gaps. Most of their VBMs are composed of the py orbitals of Y, while a minor part is composed of the py orbitals of Si. Their CBMs are mainly composed of the pz orbitals of Si with a small number of s orbitals of N. The same trend can also be found in Ge2NP, whose VBM and CBM mainly consist of the py orbitals of P and the pz orbitals of Ge, respectively. For Si2PAs, the VBM comes from the px orbitals of Si and As mostly, and the px orbitals of P consist of a small part of it. The CBM arises from the px and pz orbitals of Si with a small number of s orbitals of P. For Ge2PAs, the composition of the VBM is very similar to that of Si2PAs, but that of its CBM is different from that of Si2PAs, which arises mostly from the s orbitals of Ge. The px orbitals of Ge and P as well as the pz orbitals of As are composed of the minority.

In order to compare the band structures of the Janus M2XY monolayers and their pristine counterparts, the band structures of MX (M = Si, Ge; X = N, P, As) monolayers were calculated (displayed in Fig. S2, ESI†). Janus M2NY (M = Si, Ge; Y = P, As) monolayers have larger band dispersion around the band gap than their pristine counterparts, which could lead to relatively smaller effective masses of electrons and holes. For example, the band dispersion of the top valence band of Si2NP along the Γ–Y direction is larger than that of SiP, and the effective mass of the hole of Si2NP (0.17m0, where m0 is the free-electron mass) is less than that of SiP (0.42m0).56 Replacing P atoms by N atoms with a smaller atomic radius reduces the distance of the neighboring Si atoms (the distance is defined in Fig. S3, ESI†) from 3.531 Å (SiP) to 3.209 Å (Si2NP). The distance reduction increases the overlap of the orbitals between the neighboring Si atoms and leads to larger band dispersion.
Since Ga and As are relatively heavy elements, the electronic properties of M2XY (M = Si, Ge; X = N, P; Y = As) could be influenced by spin–orbit coupling (SOC). Fig. S4 (ESI†) presents the band structures of the Janus M2XY monolayers with the PBE + SOC level of theory. Our calculations demonstrate that, with the SOC interaction, the band structure types (direct or indirect) are maintained and a slight energy level splitting occurs around the Γ-point. The differences between the PBE and PBE + SOC band gap values are around 0.013 eV for Si2PAs, 0.003 eV for Ge2PAs and less than 0.001 eV for Si2NAs and Ge2NP. These results suggest that SOC has little effect on the band gaps of the Janus Si2NAs, Si2PAs, Ge2NP and Ge2PAs monolayers.
There exists an intrinsic electric field along the z direction in the Janus M2XY (M = Si, Ge; X, Y = N, P, As; X ≠ Y) monolayers, which is caused by the potential gradient generated from the electronegativity difference between X and Y atoms. The direction of intrinsic electric field is from the atoms with a lower electronegativity to the ones with a higher electronegativity. For example, in Janus Ge2PAs, more electrons of Ge transfer to P atoms than to As atoms. The asymmetric charge distribution leads to an intrinsic field pointing from the As atomic layer to the P atomic layer as shown in Fig. 5a. The electrostatic potential difference between them is observed and the calculated difference value is about 0.38 eV (Fig. 5d). To further investigate the electron properties of Janus M2XY nanostructures, the partial charge densities of the VBMs and CBMs were also studied. Taking Ge2PAs as an example, the VBM and CBM of it and those of two typical MX monolayers (GeP and GeAs) were calculated. In Fig. S5 (ESI†), the partial charge densities of GeP and GeAs are obviously distributed symmetrically on both sides. For Ge2PAs, as shown in Fig. 5b and c, the symmetry of the distribution of partial charge densities is broken as a result of different atomic layers on two sides.

3.4 Photocatalysis
As is well known, photocatalytic water splitting is an effective way for solar energy conversion and storage. 2D Janus materials have been regarded as promising photocatalysts in related fields due to their ideal properties including both the maximal specific surface and intrinsic internal electric fields,57,58 which could enhance the separation of electron–hole pairs and thus improve the photocatalytic activity.59,60 In principle, a prospective water splitting photocatalyst should have a moderate band gap larger than 1.23 eV and suitable band edge positions straddling the redox potential of water.61 In other words, the CBMs of the photocatalyst should be higher than EH+/H2 and the VBMs should be lower than EO2/H2O. The EH+/H2 and EO2/H2O vary with the pH value of solution and at room temperature they are expressed as follows: EH+/H2 = (−4.44 + pH × 0.0592) eV and EO2/H2O = (−5.67 + pH × 0.0592) eV.62 Then the reduction and redox potentials of water at pH values ranging from 0 to 14 can be readily estimated with the above equations.
As mentioned before, due to the intrinsic electric field of Janus 2D materials, there is an obvious difference (ΔΦ) between the electrostatic potentials on the two sides that have different electronegativities. Such a behaviour has been observed earlier in Janus MoSSe and Te2Se.63,64 Here, the ML Ge2PAs is discussed as an example. As shown in Fig. 5d, where platforms on the left and right sides represent the electrostatic potentials in vacuum, there is clearly a difference of about 0.38 eV. The ΔΦ of other ML Janus materials were also calculated and are presented in Table 3.

For M2XY Janus structures, the intrinsic electric fields make the VBMs of the X-side more negative and the CBMs of the Y-side more positive, which benefit their band edge positions to straddle the redox potential of water. The band edge positions of Janus Si2NP, Si2PAs, Ge2NP, and Ge2PAs were calculated in this study. Janus Si2NAs was not studied further here because its band gap is smaller than 1.23 eV which is required for the photocatalytic water splitting reaction. As shown in Fig. 6, according to the band edge positions of different sides, it can be found out that the intrinsic electric field of Janus Si2NP points from the N-side to the P-side, which is opposite to the scenarios of other Janus structures. This surprising outcome may result from the fact that SiN has an indirect band gap, while SiP has a direct band gap. Further investigations are needed to understand and exploit this counter-intuitive property. The band edge positions of Janus Si2PAs, Ge2NP, and Ge2PAs demonstrate that, for Ge2NP, its CBM of the P-side is lower than the reduction potential of H+/H2 at pH = 0, suggesting that the reduction of water is not favored. Interestingly, the VBM of the N-side remains low enough for the oxidation of water in the pH range from 0 to 14. This reaction selectivity could be beneficial for certain catalytic reactions. For Janus Si2PAs, the CBM of the As-side is always higher than the reduction potential of H+/H2 in the pH range from 0 to 14, implying that electrons could transfer from the conduction band to H+ to produce H2 over the studied pH range. Meanwhile, the VBM of the P-side is always lower than the oxidation potential of O2/H2O over the pH range investigated here. Therefore, electrons are able to transfer from H2O to the valence band to produce O2. It is useful to point out that although the VBM of the As-side is also lower enough to facilitate the oxidation of water, it is more positive than that of the P-side. As such, the oxidation of water tends to occur on the P-side. The band edge positions of Ge2PAs are similar to those of Si2PAs, and thus it can produce H2 and O2 from water splitting over the whole pH range studied here.

In contrast to the fact that visible light takes up more than 40% of solar energy, most conventional photocatalyst materials mainly harvest ultraviolet light rather than visible light. Thus, a higher light absorption capacity in the visible light region is another important property for designing new photocatalysts for water splitting. In this study, to find out the light absorption capacities of these Janus materials, the optical absorption spectra of Si2NP, Si2PAs, Ge2NP and Ge2PAs were calculated under polarized lights in different directions (Fig. 7). Our results reveal their strong optical anisotropy. While the predicted light absorption coefficients in the ultraviolet region all reach the order of 106 cm−1, the light absorption coefficients in the visible light region (1.6–3.1 eV) of Si2NP, Si2PAs, Ge2NP and Ge2PAs are also as high as about 5.0 × 104 cm−1, 4.0 × 104 cm−1, 1.1 × 105 cm−1 and 1.4 × 105 cm−1, respectively. These light absorption coefficients are much better than those of the pristine counterparts MX, such as SiAs (about 104 cm−1) and GeAs (about 2.0 × 104 cm−1).20 In particular, Ge2NP and Ge2PAs are comparable to the booming organic perovskite solar cells (about 105 cm−1).65 It should be noted that the above comparison was performed for the materials that were investigated through DFT with the HSE06 approach. A more precise calculation with GW calculations was not pursued in this report, limited by the high demand of computing power due to the large unit of the Janus M2XY cell that is around 20 × 4 × 20 Å3 and includes 24 atoms. Therefore, the Janus Si2NP, Si2PAs, Ge2NP and Ge2PAs could have high efficiency in the utilization of solar energy.

4. Conclusions
In this study, a novel class of hybrid binary M2XY (M = Si, Ge; X, Y = N, P, As; X ≠ Y) monolayers were proposed and their structures, stabilities, and electronic and photocatalytic properties were investigated using first-principles calculations. The phonon dispersion spectra and AIMD simulations demonstrate that Si2NP, Si2NAs, Si2PAs, Ge2NP and Ge2PAs are both thermally and dynamically stable. Their negative formation energy values imply that the synthesis of these Janus M2XY monolayers is exothermic, in which the replacement of X atoms from the binary M2X2 monolayer with the less electronegative Y atoms could be achieved experimentally. Janus Si2NP, Si2NAs, Si2PAs, and Ge2NP exhibit direct band gaps spanning from 0.82 to 2.49 eV. For M2XY Janus nanostructures, the difference in the electronegativity of pnicogen between the top and bottom surfaces creates an intrinsic electric field, which can be constructive in improving their photocatalytic capability. Notably, Si2PAs, Ge2PAs and Ge2NP were observed to have more efficient light absorption than their pristine MX structures, with their absorption coefficients reaching 4.0 × 104 cm−1, 1.4 × 105 cm−1 and 1.0 × 105 cm−1, respectively, in the visible light region. Impressively, Si2PAs and Ge2PAs have appropriate band edge positions for water splitting to produce both O2 and H2 over the whole pH range studied here. Based on the above calculations, this study suggests that the hybrid binary Janus monolayers from (IV) and (V) groups (e.g., Si2PAs and Ge2PAs) are promising candidates for photocatalysts and optoelectronic devices because of their moderate band edge positions and superior absorption coefficients. The proposed Janus Ge2NP monolayers are particularly attractive for O2 production due to their lower VBM. Significantly, the catalytic selectivity can also be achieved with the Janus M2XY structure.
