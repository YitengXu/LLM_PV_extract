    , Accepted 1st September 2017First published on 4th September 2017AbstractCreating two-dimensional (2D) crystal–metal heterostructures with an ultrathin thickness has spurred increasing research endeavors in catalysis because of its fascinating opportunities in tuning the electronic state at the surface and enhancing the chemical reactivity. Here we report a novel and facile Nb4+-assisted strategy for the in situ growth of highly dispersed Pd nanoparticles (NPs) on monolayer HNb3O8 nanosheets (HNb3O8 NS) constituting a 2D Pd/HNb3O8 NS heterostructure composite without using extra reducing agents and stabilizing agents. The Pd NP formation is directed via a redox reaction between an oxidative Pd salt precursor (H2PdCl4) and reductive unsaturated surface metal (Nb4+) sites induced by light irradiation on monolayer HNb3O8 NS. The periodic arrangement of metal Nb nodes on HNb3O8 NS leads to a homogeneous distribution of Pd NPs. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the direct redox reaction between the Nb4+ and Pd2+ ions leads to a strong chemical interaction between the formed Pd metal NPs and the monolayer HNb3O8 support. Consequently, the as-obtained Pd/HNb3O8 composite serves as a highly efficient bifunctional catalyst in both heterogeneous thermocatalytic and photocatalytic selective reduction of aromatic nitro compounds in water under ambient conditions. The achieved high activity originates from the unique 2D nanosheet configuration and in situ Pd incorporation, which leads to a large active surface area, strong metal–support interaction and enhanced charge transport capability. Moreover, this facile Nb4+-assisted synthetic route has demonstrated to be general, which can be applied to load other metals such as Au and Pt on monolayer HNb3O8 NS. It is anticipated that this work can extend the facile preparation of noble metal/nanosheet 2D heterostructures, as well as promote the simultaneous capture of duple renewable thermal and photon energy sources to drive an energy efficient catalytic process.
Introduction
Two-dimensional (2D) nanosheets, as a new class of nanoscale materials, have triggered keen research interest due to their unconventional physicochemical properties arising from unique 2D structures and the quantum confinement effect.1–7 Over the past decades, various types of 2D nanosheets including graphene,8–10 metal dichalcogenides,11–13 hydroxide and oxide nanosheets14–16 have been reported. Among them, ultrathin oxide nanosheets obtained via the exfoliation of layered compounds are particularly attractive because of their high diversity and tunability over composition and structure.17 These nanosheet crystallites possess a high 2D anisotropy with extremely thin thickness in the nanometer and even subnanometer scale versus lateral dimensions from submicro- to micrometres. This structural aspect is expected to lead to intriguing properties that are rarely present in those of conventional bulk nanocrystallites, such as the extremely high percentage of exposed specific crystal facets, huge specific surface areas, and large fraction of unsaturated surface metal sites (USMSs).18,19 The USMSs of these materials could function as active sites and contact with other components and/or substrates intimately, making them attractive candidates for applications including photoluminescence, electrochemistry and photocatalysis.20–22 Besides, the high specific surface area and ultrathin thickness of these nanosheets also make them ideal platforms for the construction of composite catalysts by integration with other active components, such as noble-metal NPs.23,24 The introduction of noble-metal NPs can not only retain and enhance the functionalities of the nanosheets, but also generate new functionalities.25
During the past decade, diverse strategies have emerged for the synthesis of metal NP/nanosheet composites, including the wet chemical reduction method,26,27 chemical vapor deposition,28 electrochemical methods,29,30 and photodeposition methods.31 In most cases, these strategies require time-consuming procedures with the assistance of reducing agents and stabilizers. However, the crystalline texture of the starting matrices tends to be affected by the strong reducing agents used in the synthesis. Furthermore, the presence of an obstacle on the interface will hinder effective contact and direct charge transfer between the catalysts and the reactants.32 As for the classical photodeposition method, it is relatively simple but allows poor control over the morphology and size distribution of the deposited NPs.33 The development of effective and easy accessible routes for the preparation of strongly interfaced metal NPs/nanosheets, particularly without using strong reducing agents or stabilizing molecules, is still an ongoing challenge. In this context, “clean” synthesis strategies for preparing noble metal-based functional materials have received increasing attention.34–36 As reported, metal salts can be reduced in situ by some of the reductive support materials without the addition of any reducing agents or surfactants. Because of the clean surfaces and the strong binding force between the different components of the composites, excellent performance can be expected on the as-obtained sample. Most recently, our group has observed an interesting photochromic phenomenon of monolayer HNb3O8 under light irradiation, which is associated with the reduction of the Nb5+ centre to unsaturated Nb4+ sites by photogenerated electrons.37,38 Noticeably, unsaturated metal cations with a low valence state normally have strong reduction capability. This inspires us to exploit them as clean reductants to react with the oxidative noble metal salts for constructing metal/nanosheet composites directly.
Herein, we demonstrate a clean and facile in situ growth of highly dispersed Pd NPs on monolayer HNb3O8 NS that constitutes a 2D Pd/HNb3O8 NS heterostructure. The synthesis is realized via a simple, light induced generation of unsaturated Nb4+ sites with strong reductivity on the surface of monolayer HNb3O8 NS, which then successively reduces the oxidative Pd salt precursor (H2PdCl4) and forms Pd NPs. Such an approach offers salient features such as the uniform dispersion of Pd NPs on monolayer HNb3O8 NS, clean interfacial contact and strong chemical interaction within the two components, as well as the exposure of a large active surface area. These properties make important contributions to the performance of catalysts. Moreover, the monolayer HNb3O8 NS features light absorption and can take advantage of solar energy, which allows the Pd NPs and monolayer HNb3O8 NS to function in a collaborative way. The obtained Pd/HNb3O8 NS has been applied to the thermo/photo-catalytic selective reduction of nitro compounds to amines in water. As a proof-of-concept, we have also extended this synthetic protocol to load other metals like Au and Pt onto the surface of HNb3O8 NS via a similar procedure.
Experimental section
Synthesis

Synthesis of HNb3O8 nanosheets (NS). 
HNb3O8 NS was synthesized via a cation-exchange assisted exfoliation process.39 Typically, Nb2O5 and K2CO3 were mixed in a stoichiometric ratio and heated at 900 °C for 10 h to prepare the layered KNb3O8. The proton-exchange reaction for the generation of layered HNb3O8 was carried out in an aqueous solution of nitric acid (6 mol L−1, 60 mL g−1 of KNb3O8 at room temperature for 6 days). The HNb3O8 recovered from the acid solution was washed thoroughly with distilled water. The exfoliation of the layered HNb3O8 was achieved by the intercalation of tetrabutylammonium (TBA) cations into the layers of HNb3O8. Briefly, 1.273 g of tetra-(n-butylammonium) hydroxide (TBA+ OH−) solution was added into 100 mL of distilled water containing 2.0 g of layered HNb3O8. The resultant solution was shaken for 14 days. The insertion of voluminous hydrophilic TBA+ cations expands the interlayer spaces, resulting in the exfoliation of individual metal oxide sheets. The suspension was then centrifuged, and the supernatant solution containing the nanosheets was collected. The addition of an HNO3 aqueous solution (1.0 M, 20 mL) to 30 mL of the nanosheet solution resulted in immediate precipitation of the nanosheets. The as-obtained HNb3O8 nanosheets were washed with deionized water to remove HNO3 and were dried at 60 °C in a vacuum oven.


Light-induced formation of surface unsaturated HNb3O8 NS (Nb4+-HNb3O8). 
0.05 g of the as-prepared HNb3O8 NS was dispersed in a N2 purged Pyrex glass reactor containing ethanol (8 mL) and distilled water (8 mL), and the mixture was subject to ultraviolet (UV) light irradiation (λ ≥ 320 nm) for 20 min using a 300 W Xe arc lamp (PLS-SXE 300, Beijing Perfectlight Co. Ltd). After the light irradiation, the color of the sample turned from white to blue, indicating the formation of Nb4+ ions in HNb3O8 NS. The obtained Nb4+-HNb3O8 sample can be preserved in the sealed vessel to prevent the Nb4+ ions from oxidization.


Preparation of the Pd/HNb3O8 NS composite. 
After the generation of Nb4+ ions in HNb3O8 NS, H2PdCl4 aqueous solution (2 wt% of Pd) was quickly injected into the above Nb4+-HNb3O8 solution in the dark. Instantaneously, the blue color of the suspension faded and changed to light brown, denoting a fast redox reaction between the Nb4+-HNb3O8 NS and the Pd precursor (H2PdCl4). After stirring for about 2 min, the Pd/HNb3O8 sample in the reactor was collected and washed with water several times, and dried at 60 °C for characterization and further use.


Preparation of the Pd/HNb3O8-PVP composite. 
For comparison purpose, a Pd/HNb3O8–PVP composite with the same weight content of Pd (2%) as that of the Pd/HNb3O8 NS sample was fabricated. Firstly, colloidal Pd nanoparticles stabilized by polyvinylpyrrolidone (Pd–PVP) with an average size of ca. 2–3 nm was prepared by an alcohol reduction method.40 Then, the Pd colloid was mixed with the HNb3O8 NS and loaded onto the surface of HNb3O8 NS forming the Pd/HNb3O8–PVP composite.

Characterization
The as-prepared samples were characterized using powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) on a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer operated at 40 kV and 40 mA with Ni-filtered Cu Kα irradiation (λ = 1.5406 Å). The morphology of the samples was determined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis using an S-4800 microscope (Hitachi, Japan). Transmission electron microscopy and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images were obtained using a JEOL model JEM 2010 EX instrument at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. A tapping-mode atomic force microscope (AFM, Nanoscope Multimode IIIa, Veeco Instruments) with a Si-tip cantilever was used to evaluate the morphology of the obtained nanosheets on the mica substrate. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurement was performed on a PHI Quantum 2000 XPS system with a monochromatic Al Kα source and a charge neutralizer. N2 adsorption–desorption analysis was carried out on an ASAP2020 M apparatus (Micromeritics Instrument Corp., USA). The samples were degassed under vacuum at 120 °C for 6 h and then analyzed at 77 K. Electron spin resonance (ESR) signals were recorded with a Bruker A300 spectrometer. A 300 W Xe lamp (PLS-SXE 300, Beijing Perfectlight Co. Ltd) was used as a light source.
Thermocatalytic activity
The thermocatalytic nitro reduction was conducted as follows: 10 mg of Pd/HNb3O8 was suspended in 40 mL of the aqueous nitro solution (10 mg L−1) in a quartz vial. Then the reaction solution was stirred in the dark for 1 h to establish an adsorption–desorption equilibrium between the catalyst and the nitro compound. After that, 40 mg of HCOONH4 was added into the reaction solution. As the reaction proceeded, 3 mL of the suspension was taken at a certain time interval and was centrifuged to remove the catalyst. Then the reaction solution was analyzed on a Varian UV-vis spectrophotometer (Cary-50, Varian Co.). The whole experiment was carried out under N2 bubbling at a flow rate of 60 mL min−1. To determine the conversion and selectivity of the reaction, the reaction solution was analyzed with a Shimadzu High Performance Liquid Chromatograph (HPLC-LC20AT equipped with a C18 column and SPD-M20A photo diode array detector). Conversion and selectivity for the reduction of nitro compounds were defined as the following:Conversion (%) = [(C0 − Cr)/C0] × 100Selectivity (%) = [Cp/(C0 − Cr)] × 100where C0 is the initial concentration of the nitro compound and Cr and Cp represent the concentration of the reactant nitro compound and the product amine, respectively, at a certain time after the catalytic reaction.
Photocatalytic activity
In the photocatalytic reaction, 10 mg of Pd/HNb3O8 was dispersed into 40 mL of the aqueous nitro solution (10 mg L−1) in a quartz vial. Before irradiation, the solution was stirred in the dark for 1 h to establish an adsorption–desorption equilibrium between the catalyst and reactant. Then 40 mg of HCOONH4 was added into the reaction solution. After that, the reaction system was irradiated by a 300 W Xe arc lamp (PLS-SXE 300, Beijing Perfectlight Co. Ltd) (λ ≥ 320 nm). As the reaction proceeded, 3 mL of the suspension was taken at a certain time interval and analyzed on a Varian UV-vis spectrophotometer (Cary-50, Varian Co.). The whole photocatalytic process was carried out under N2 bubbling at a flow rate of 60 mL min−1. To determine the conversion and selectivity of the reaction, the reaction solution was also analyzed using a Shimadzu High Performance Liquid Chromatograph that was used for the thermocatalytic reduction of nitro compounds.
Density functional calculations
All DFT calculations were carried out using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP)41–43 with the gradient-corrected PW91 exchange-correction functional.44 For valence electrons, a plane-wave basis set was described with an energy cut-off of 450 eV and the ionic cores were described with the projector augmented-wave method.45,46 A slab model for the HNb3O8 surface consists of a 1 × 2 unit cell with all atoms relaxed. A 3 × 3 × 1 Monkhorst–Pack k-point grid was used to sample the Brillouin zone. In order to separate the substrate and its repeatable images in the y direction, a vacuum spacing was set to be 20 Å. Spin-polarization calculation was considered. The adsorption energy was calculated as follows: Eads = E (nanoparticle/surface) − E (nanoparticle) − E (free surface).
Results and discussion
The in situ growth of highly dispersed Pd nanoparticles on monolayer HNb3O8 nanosheets for constructing the Pd/HNb3O8 NS hybrid composite was realized via a direct redox reaction between light-induced surface unsaturated metal sites Nb4+ and a Pd precursor (H2PdCl4), as schematically illustrated in Fig. 1a. First, the monolayer HNb3O8 NS were dispersed in ethanol–water solution and exposed to UV light under N2 bubbling. With the light irradiation, the color of the sample gradually turned from white to blue, and became darker with prolongation of exposure time (Fig. S1, ESI†). This obvious color change is due to the formation of Nb4+ on the monolayer HNb3O8 NS by electron trapping at Nb5+ centers under light irradiation, while the holes were captured by ethanol. Low temperature electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) analysis of the HNb3O8 NS before and after light irradiation confirms the formation of Nb4+. As shown in Fig. 1b, a new signal around g = 1.914 is observed after light irradiation, which is assignable to Nb4+,47,48 providing direct evidence of the partial reduction of Nb5+ in the HNb3O8 NS. Moreover, the signal at around g = 2.003 assigned to oxygen vacancies becomes clearly stronger after the light irradiation, which also indicates the increase of the concentration of unsaturated Nb atoms on the surface of HNb3O8 NS. This can be further supported by the XPS analysis of the samples. The O 1s spectrum of HNb3O8 NS shows an additional peak at 531.6 eV after the light irradiation (Fig. S2, ESI†), which also implies the generation of oxygen vacancies.49,50 In the following, when the oxidative Pd precursor (H2PdCl4) was added into the reductive Nb4+-HNb3O8 NS dispersion in the dark, Pd2+ can be directly reduced by Nb4+ within seconds, and nucleated rapidly on the surface of HNb3O8 NS, growing into clusters and further into Pd NPs. Meanwhile, Nb4+ was oxidized by Pd2+ and converted into Nb5+, thus forming the highly dispersed Pd nanoparticle decorated monolayer HNb3O8 (Pd/HNb3O8 NS) hybrid composite.

Fig. 1c displays the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the bulk HNb3O8, HNb3O8 NS and hybrid Pd/HNb3O8, which were recorded to investigate the crystal structure and purity of the samples. The X-ray diffractogram of the bulk HNb3O8 presents a well-defined crystallinity of the product, with all peaks matching well with the standard HNb3O8 data (JCPDS: 44-0672). The inset in Fig. 1c schematically illustrates that HNb3O8 is constructed of 2D Nb3O8− anion slices built by corner- and edge-sharing NbO6 octahedra, while the H+ cations are located between the slices. Notably, in comparison with the precursor of bulk KNb3O8 (Fig. S3, ESI†), the characteristic (020) peak of layered HNb3O8 shifts to a lower 2θ angle (from 8.41° to 8.06°) after the proton-exchange process, denoting an increased interplanar stacking distance of the layered HNb3O8 (1.12 nm) as compared to that of bulk KNb3O8 (1.06 nm). The expanded interlayer distance is beneficial for the intercalation of tetrabutylammonium (TBA) cations in the subsequent cation-exchange step. After the delamination of the layered HNb3O8, the obtained HNb3O8 NS exhibits only two weak and broad diffraction peaks, revealing the loss of the periodic layered structure, as well as long-range ordering in the HNb3O8 NS. This could serve as strong evidence for the existence of the HNb3O8 nanosheets with few layers or even a single layer.51 Meanwhile, the (020) peak of the as-exfoliated HNb3O8 NS also shifts to a lower angle compared to its parent layered HNb3O8, suggesting that the interlayer spacing of HNb3O8 NS is further increased after exfoliation. Moreover, the hybrid Pd/HNb3O8 NS exhibits a similar XRD pattern with the blank HNb3O8 NS, indicating that the structure of the HNb3O8 substrate remains after the Pd NP loading. No characteristic peaks corresponding to Pd are observed in the Pd/HNb3O8 NS hybrid composite. This could be ascribed to the even distribution and low loading content of Pd NPs.52
To investigate the structure and morphology of the as-prepared samples, field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) have been performed. As shown in Fig. 2a and Fig. S4 (ESI†), the bulk HNb3O8 displays a typical thick lamellar structure. The structure is similar to that of bulk KNb3O8 (Fig. S5, ESI†), implying the persistence of the layered structure after the proton exchange reaction. In contrast, the TBA+-assisted exfoliated HNb3O8 NS shows a significant change in the morphology as compared to these two precursor samples, which are seen to be mainly composed of loose and irregular tissue-like thin nanosheets (Fig. 2b), indicating the successful exfoliation of bulk HNb3O8. Fig. 2c shows the TEM image of the as-exfoliated HNb3O8 NS, which further confirms the nanosheet feature of the product. The HNb3O8 NS with a large lateral size are nearly transparent in the TEM image, implying their ultrathin nature. To directly estimate the quantitative thickness of the nanosheets, atomic force microscopy (AFM) analysis has been conducted. As shown in Fig. 2d, the typical AFM image of the HNb3O8 NS reveals a 2D nanosheet structure with a smooth surface. The height image shows obvious plateaus with a step height of about 1.2 nm (Fig. 2e), which is close to the thickness of a single-layered HNb3O8 slab along the [010] direction, demonstrating the successful exfoliation of monolayer HNb3O8 NS. Moreover, Fig. 2f shows the SEM image of the Pd/HNb3O8 NS hybrid composite, which shows that the characteristic morphology of the pristine HNb3O8 NS is well preserved after the in situ redox growth of Pd NPs on the HNb3O8 NS. The corresponding energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis of the Pd/HNb3O8 NS shows a Pd peak (Fig. S6, ESI†). However, no obvious Pd NPs are distinguished from the SEM image, possibly because of the tiny size and homogeneous dispersion of the in situ growing of Pd NPs on the HNb3O8 NS, which is consistent with the XRD analysis.

In addition, Fig. 3a displays the TEM analysis of the Pd/HNb3O8 NS hybrid composite, which provides more detailed and direct morphological and structural information about the sample. From the typical TEM image, it can be observed that the Pd NPs are distributed throughout the HNb3O8 NS in a uniform and dense way. No obvious aggregation of Pd NPs occurs. The average diameters of the obtained Pd NPs are 1.5–3.5 nm (the inset in Fig. 3a). The high-resolution TEM image of the Pd NPs in Fig. 3b shows a clear lattice spacing of 0.228 nm, corresponding to the (111) plane of Pd. Additionally, elemental mapping analysis has also been performed to reveal the element distribution in the Pd/HNb3O8 NS hybrid composite. As shown in Fig. 3c, the result indicates that the Pd element spreads on the whole HNb3O8 nanosheets. Furthermore, the chemical states of the constituted elements in the as-prepared Pd/HNb3O8 NS have been investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurement. As shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†), the survey XPS spectrum confirms the existence of C, Pd, Nb and O elements. No other impurity peak has been observed. Specifically, the high-resolution XPS spectrum of Nb 3d (Fig. 3d) shows the binding energies of the Nb 3d5/2 and Nb 3d3/2 peaks at 207.0 and 209.7 eV, respectively, demonstrating that the Nb in the sample exists in the state of Nb5+.53 In the Pd spectrum, the characteristic peaks of Pd 3d5/2 and Pd 3d3/2 located at 335.2 and 340.6 eV are assigned to metallic Pd0. Notably, two additional peaks/components located at 337.4 and 342.8 eV assigned to Pd2+ are also observed.54,55 The presence of Pd2+ is attributed to the adsorption of unreacted Pd2+ on the HNb3O8 NS surface due to the electrostatic attractive interaction. XPS analysis together with the TEM results confirm that the metallic Pd NPs have been successfully deposited on the monolayer HNb3O8 NS via the facile and clean unsaturated Nb4+-assisted in situ redox method.

To further explore the interaction between Pd and HNb3O8 NS, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed with a theoretical model of nanoparticles with 3 or 4 Pd atoms adsorbed onto the HNb3O8 layer. As shown in Fig. 4, the DFT calculation results confirm that the configurations of the HNb3O8 NS before and after deposition of Pd are almost the same, consistent with the XRD and SEM results. From the DFT calculations, the Pd atoms are found to bind with Nb and O atoms of HNb3O8 NS. The calculated adsorption energies for Pd3 and Pd4 NPs are −8.62 and −7.74 eV, respectively, indicating a strong interaction between Pd atoms and HNb3O8 NS. Moreover, from the Bader charge analysis,56 it can be found that the HNb3O8 NS lost 0.24 and 0.23 electrons which transfer to the Pd3 and Pd4 NPs. The result demonstrates that our preparation method not only presents a simple yet efficient method for fabricating Pd nanoparticles without foreign reducing agents, but also offers a feasible way to modify the electronic properties of supported metal nanoparticles.

In the following, the catalytic performance of the as-synthesized hybrid Pd/HNb3O8 NS composite has been evaluated by an aqueous-phase hydrogenation of nitroaromatics to corresponding amines, which is an important organic transformation in industrial chemistry. The amines are valuable industrial intermediates for the production of a variety of fine chemicals.57–60 Initially, a preliminary study was carried out by using Pd/HNb3O8 NS for the reduction of 4-nitroaniline (4-NA) to p-phenylenediamine (PPD) with the addition of ammonium formate (HCOONH4). When both the Pd/HNb3O8 NS and HCOONH4 were added into the solution and purged with N2, it is remarkable to find clear thermal catalytic activity. As shown in Fig. 5a, the absorption peak at 380 nm ascribed to 4-NA is gradually decreased, accompanied by the appearance of two peaks at 238 and 305 nm simultaneously. The new peaks observed at 238 and 305 nm are the characteristic peaks of PPD,61 revealing that 4-NA has been successfully converted to PPD by the Pd/HNb3O8 NS catalyst. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) has been used to further ascertain the products of the reduction reaction. The result shows that PPD is the prominent product with a high selectivity of ca. 99%. Besides, it is worth noting that once the HCOONH4 is added, the reduction of 4-NA over Pd/HNb3O8 NS starts instantaneously. This would be advantageous for ease of use in practical applications.62

To highlight the advantage of our present method for the preparation of noble metal-based composite catalysts, we have further synthesized a reference Pd/HNb3O8–PVP composite with the same weight content of Pd (2%) as that of the Pd/HNb3O8 NS and carried out an activity comparison between them. As shown in Fig. 5b, the Pd/HNb3O8–PVP composite shows a much lower catalytic activity than the hybrid composite Pd/HNb3O8 NS. Only 18% conversion of 4-NA is achieved within the reaction of 60 min. The poor activity should be ascribed to the presence of the stabilizing organic ligand PVP, which strongly adheres on the metal surface and hinders the access of reactant to the metal. Moreover, with the view to exploring the significant promoting effect of the ultrathin thickness of HNb3O8 nanosheets on the catalytic activity of the hybrid Pd/HNb3O8 NS, bulk HNb3O8 has also been utilized as a support to anchor Pd NPs via the Nb4+-assisted method (denoted as Pd/HNb3O8-Bulk). Impressively, Pd/HNb3O8-Bulk also displays significantly decreased activity in comparison with Pd/HNb3O8 NS. The reason for the low activity of Pd/HNb3O8-Bulk can be attributed to the detrimental layer aggregation of bulk HNb3O8, which greatly hampers the exposure of surface unsaturated metal sites and the reduction of Pd2+, as demonstrated by the nitrogen adsorption–desorption measurement in Fig. 5c. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) specific surface area of HNb3O8 NS is calculated to be 83.1 m2 g−1, which is markedly higher than that of bulk HNb3O8 (9.1 m2 g−1). The highly exposed surface of HNb3O8 NS is beneficial for the generation of light-induced Nb4+, which significantly facilitates the reduction of Pd2+. This has been supported by XPS analysis. As shown in Fig. S8 (ESI†), for the Pd/HNb3O8 NS sample, the molar ratio of Pd0:Pd2+ is 3.2:1. Whereas for the Pd/HNb3O8-Bulk, the molar ratio of Pd0:Pd2+ is 1.2:1. The comparative data directly demonstrate the more efficient reduction of Pd over HNb3O8 NS. Moreover, the HNb3O8 NS with a larger BET specific surface area allows better mass transport of reactants to the catalyst than the bulk HNb3O8, which also contributes to the higher activity of the Pd/HNb3O8 NS sample. The results suggest that the unique nanosheet configuration of HNb3O8 NS has a profound impact on the catalytic performance, and further demonstrate the superiority of using the nanosheets for supporting noble metals.
In a set of experiments, we have further examined the thermocatalytic activities of the hybrid Pd/HNb3O8 NS composite toward the reduction of various substituted aromatic nitro compounds under the same reaction conditions. The results are displayed in Table 1; it is clear to see that the Pd/HNb3O8 NS successfully convert a range of aromatic nitro composites to their corresponding amines, with high yields, after reaction for 60 min. In principle, the conversions of these substrates could be further improved by optimizing the catalytic conditions such as prolonging the reaction time. The results indicate that the hybrid Pd/HNb3O8 NS is an effective yet mild catalyst for nitro reduction at room temperature. Notably, in this catalytic system, the favorable properties of HCOONH4 such as being inexpensive, stable and nontoxic also largely improve the environmental and economic impact of this Pd-catalyzed hydrogenation reaction.

To shed light on the reaction mechanism of the nitro compounds’ reduction over the Pd/HNb3O8 NS catalyst, a set of controlled experiments were performed. As shown in Fig. S9 (ESI†), no obvious nitro reduction is observed in the absence of Pd/HNb3O8 NS or HCOONH4. In addition, when the reaction is conducted with blank HNb3O8 NS (no Pd NPs), negligible catalytic reduction activity is obtained. Therefore, it is reasonable to deduce that the nitro reduction is primarily driven by the Pd NPs with the assistance of HCOONH4. Moreover, the EPR spin-trap technique (with DMPO as a trapping reagent) has been employed to probe the microscopic details of the Pd mediated electron transfer process. As shown in Fig. 5d, characteristic peaks of the DMPO–˙CO2− adduct are clearly observed in the presence of Pd/HNb3O8 and HCOONH4.63,64 Furthermore, as indicated by theoretical simulations, the electrons in HNb3O8 NS will flow toward Pd due to the strong electronic interaction between HNb3O8 and Pd. This is confirmed by the XPS result in Fig. S10 (ESI†). The binding energy of the O 1s of lattice oxygen (Nb–O) for the blank HNb3O8 NS is 530.2 eV. After the Pd decoration, the O 1s (Nb–O) of the Pd/HNb3O8 NS sample is shifted to 530.6 eV. The positive shift of the binding energy indicates that the electrons transfer from the O of HNb3O8 to Pd. Pd with accumulated negative charges could greatly facilitate the dehydrogenation of HCOO− ions and promote the formation of the ˙CO2− radical species, as illustrated in eqn (1). The ˙CO2− radicals with strong reducing power (E0(CO2/˙CO2−) = −1.8 V) are highly active for nitro reduction (eqn (2)).65 In addition, Pd–H is not stable; it would decompose during the catalytic reaction to generate hydrogen for the hydrogenation of the nitro compounds. After the release of hydrogen, Pd–H is recovered to Pd (eqn (3)). Consequently, the catalytic reduction of nitro compounds to the corresponding amines by hybrid Pd/HNb3O8 NS is realized. Pd + H–COO− → Pd–H + {˙}CO2−(1) 6{˙}CO2− + R–NO2 + 6H+ → R–NH2 + 2H2O + 6CO2(2) 6Pd–H + R–NO2 → R–NH2 + 2H2O + 6Pd(3)
On the basis of the above discussion, the catalytic reduction of nitro compounds may be driven by the ˙CO2− radical species which arises from the dehydrogenation of HCOONH4 over Pd; the negative charges of Pd contribute to accelerating the catalytic reduction process. Under such circumstances, we infer that a further increase of the electron density on Pd sites may achieve a higher catalytic performance of Pd/HNb3O8 NS. Moreover, it is noteworthy that the monolayer HNb3O8 NS support is a light-active semiconductor. This is significantly different from the traditional photoinactive supports like SiO2 and MgO. The photoactive HNb3O8 NS provides a fascinating possibility of promoting the catalytic reduction efficiency of nitro compounds through the synergistic effect of the HNb3O8 NS substrate and the supported Pd nanoparticles under light irradiation. Therefore, to further explore the catalytic performances of the hybrid Pd/HNb3O8 NS composite, we have tested the catalytic reduction of the series of substituted aromatic nitro compounds over Pd/HNb3O8 under simulated solar light irradiation. The reaction temperature is kept a constant to eliminate the influence of the thermal effect caused by light irradiation. As summarized in Table 2, the reduction reaction proceeds very quickly over the light irradiated Pd/HNb3O8 NS; the nitro compounds are effectively reduced to the corresponding amines with high conversions by Pd/HNb3O8 NS in a short reaction time (8 min). The high photocatalytic activity can be attributed to the synergistic effect of HNb3O8 NS and Pd. At the contact interface between Pd and HNb3O8 NS, the electrons are transferred from HNb3O8 to Pd under light illumination, leading to the increased surface electron densities of Pd NPs, which hence facilitates the hydrogenation of the nitro compounds, as illustrated in Fig. 6.

Finally, as a proof-of-concept, we have also extended this synthetic protocol to prepare other noble metals like Au and Pt via a similar procedure. The results have been shown in Fig. S11 and S12 (ESI†). As expected, the Au and Pt metal particles are successfully deposited onto the surface of HNb3O8 NS with a uniform distribution. Based on these results, we believe that this facile Nb4+-assisted approach is a general strategy for developing metal NPs/HNb3O8 NS composite systems. Moreover, this method is also expected to be applicable to fabricate other noble metal–semiconductor nanostructures that contain transition metal oxides with variable valence states such as W or Ti.
Conclusions
In summary, we have developed a novel and simple Nb4+-assisted strategy for the in situ growth of highly dispersed Pd NPs on monolayer HNb3O8 NS in the absence of foreign reducing agents and stabilizing agents. Through the redox reaction between the reductive Nb4+-HNb3O8 and oxidative metal salt precursors, Pd NPs are intimately anchored on the HNb3O8 NS surface. The as-obtained hybrid Pd/HNb3O8 NS exhibits high thermocatalytic activities for the selective reduction of a series of nitro compounds to amines. Particularly, it has demonstrated that the reduction of nitroaromatics can be significantly accelerated under light irradiation through the synergistic effect of the photoactive HNb3O8 NS substrate and the supported Pd NPs, which denotes the capture of energy power from multiple sources. Moreover, this synthetic strategy can be generally applicable to other metals, such as Au and Pt, for constituting the noble metal–monolayer HNb3O8 NS hybrid composite. Considering the excellent properties and broad applications of both noble metal NPs and semiconductor nanosheets, we anticipate that our study can provide a generic strategy for the design of other novel metal/nanosheet functional materials for different applications.
