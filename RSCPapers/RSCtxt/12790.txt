Introduction
The fabrication of absorber layers for thin film solar cells has received considerable interest due to the potential application of these materials as the next generation of photovoltaic devices. For example, CuInSe2, as one of the best absorber materials in single junction thin film solar cells, is still the main focus of research in the area of thin film solar cells.1–3 CdTe and CdSe thin films with suitable bandgaps and photosensitivity have been used as photovoltaic cells.4,5 However, more and more researchers have concentrated on metal sulfide thin film materials, such as CdS, ZnS, In2S3 and CuxS, in recent years due to their excellent photoelectrical properties.6–12 Furthermore, ternary metal sulfide thin films, which offer alternatives to appropriate forbidden bandwidths, have been the focus of much research because of their excellent optical properties and electrical properties and their potential applications in linear and nonlinear optical devices and photovoltaic solar cells. For example, chalcopyrite CuInS2 thin films have attracted much attention as ideal candidates for use in thin film solar cells owing to their high absorption coefficient and optimal band gap energy of 1.45 eV,13–15 which is well matched to the solar spectrum. However, indium is scarce in mineral resources, and the application prospect is limited. The relatively rich resources of bismuth have received attention from more and more people. More and more researchers have begun to concentrate on Cu3BiS3 due to its band gap of 1.4–1.5 eV16 and lower cost, and it could be the next focus of research instead of CuInS2.
So far, few methods have been adopted to fabricate Cu3BiS3 thin films due to the difficulties in the synthesis of ternary compounds. For instance, Gerein and Haber synthesized Cu3BiS3 thin films by vapor deposition;17 Mesa and his partners prepared Cu3BiS3 thin films by chemical vapor deposition with two steps;18 Nair deposited Bi2S3 on CuS films to prepare Cu3BiS3 by heat treatment.19
However, these routes, which need harsh reaction conditions with undesirable results, lead to difficulties in application, and no photoelectric characteristic was studied.
The solvothermal route is a convenient way to synthesise thin film materials and has been adopted by more and more researchers. Several reports have been found on the synthesis of metal sulfide films: Xia and coworkers synthesized CuInS2 films on fluorine doped tin dioxide (FTO) and studied the photoelectric characteristics;20 Yan and coworkers synthesized a CuZnSnS4 film on a conducting glass substrate;21 Jia and coworkers synthesized ZnIn2S4 thin films.22
In this work, we present the synthesis of Cu3BiS3 nanosheet films by a solvothermal route on a TiO2/FTO substrate, and the photoelectrochemical characteristics are studied. The same route can be used to synthesize other metal sulfide films.
Experimental section
Preparation of the TiO2 nanorod arrays on FTO
TiO2 nanorod arrays were prepared on FTO substrates (20 × 20 mm) by a hydrothermal route and the process was similar to the literature.23 In a typical synthesis, 15 mL of deionized water was mixed with 15 mL of concentrated hydrochloric acid (36.5%–38% by weight) to reach a total volume of 30 mL in a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave (50 mL volume). The mixture was stirred at ambient conditions for 5 min before the addition of 0.30 mL of titanium tetrachloride (97% Aldrich). After that, two pieces of the FTO substrates, ultrasonically cleaned for 60 min in a mixed solution of deionized water, acetone, and 2-propanol with volume ratios of 1:1:1, were placed at an angle against the wall of the Teflon-liner with the conducting side facing down. The hydrothermal synthesis was conducted at 180 °C for 2.5 h in an electric oven. After the synthesis, the autoclave was cooled to room temperature under flowing water, which took approximately 15 min. The FTO substrate was taken out, rinsed extensively with deionized water and allowed to dry in ambient air.
Deposition of Cu3BiS3 on the TiO2 nanorod arrays
The preparation of the Cu3BiS3/TiO2 composite films was as follows: CuCl (0.0297 g, 0.3 mmol) and Bi(NO3)3·5H2O (0.0485 g, 0.1 mmol) were added to a mixed solution of glycerol and ethanol (40 mL, the volume ratio was 1:1), in which both CuCl and Bi(NO3)3 can be easily dissolved. After stirring vigorously for 3–6 h, mercaptoethanol (C2H6OS, 0.08 mL, 0.6 mmol) was added to the mixed solution, and the color of the solution turned to orange immediately. After stirring for 5 minutes, two pieces of the TiO2/FTO substrates were placed at an angle against the wall of a 50 mL Teflon-liner with the conducting side facing down. The solvothermal synthesis was conducted at 180 °C for 1 h, 3 h and 6 h in an electric oven, respectively. After that, a high concentration (the mole numbers of CuCl, Bi(NO3)3 and C2H6OS are 0.6 mmol, 0.2 mmol and 0.6 mmol, respectively) and a low concentration (the mole numbers of CuCl, Bi(NO3)3 and C2H6OS are 0.15 mmol, 0.05 mmol and 0.15 mmol, respectively) of the reactants were added into the Teflon-liner by the same route to study the change in the morphology of the thin films. The autoclave was cooled to room temperature under flowing water after the synthesis, which took approximately 15 min. The FTO substrates were taken out, rinsed extensively with deionized water and allowed to dry in ambient air.
Characterization
A transmission electron microscope (TEM, TF20), high resolution transmission microscope (HRTEM) and scanning electron microscope (FESEM, JSM-6701F, Japan) were used to detected the microstructure of the thin films. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, PHI-5702) was used to analyze the composition and valence state of the samples. A powder X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Rigaku D/MAX-2500, Japan) was used to measure the crystal structure of the sample using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15418 nm) in the 2θ range of 10°–80° and at a scanning speed of 0.02° S−1. UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded by a LabTech (China) spectrophotometer within the wavelength range of 300–1000 nm. The photoelectrical conversion efficiency of the as-prepared samples was determined by a CELL-S500 (China) solar simulator with a certain concentration of a I2–KI solution as the electrolyte, and transparent platinum glass was prepared as the electrode. The preparation route of the transparent platinum glass is that platinum was magnetron sputtered onto the FTO glass surface to give a total thickness of an 800 nm flat film (the thickness of the FTO film is 400 nm), and this thickness can ensure the conductivity of the electrode and transparency to absorb enough light.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1 shows FESEM, TEM and HRTEM images of the TiO2 nanorod film grown by a hydrothermal route at 180 °C for 2.5 h with TiCl4 as a reactant in a hydrochloric acid solution (the ratio of the concentrated hydrochloric acid and distilled water was 1:1). Fig. 1a shows a typical FESEM image of the TiO2 nanorod arrays grown on the FTO substrate, and the image reveals that the entire surface of the FTO substrate is covered very uniformly by TiO2 nanorods, and from the inset image we can see that the TiO2 nanorods grow on the FTO substrate vertically and the thickness of the thin film is about 2.7 μm. Fig. 1b shows a TEM image of the TiO2 nanorods scratched from the FTO substrate by a thin blade, from which we can see that the diameter of a nanorod is about 120 nm. Fig. 1c is an HRTEM image of the scratched TiO2 nanorods, and it reveals the clear lattice fringes of TiO2 with an interplanar distance of about 0.323 nm, which is the typical characteristic fringe spacing of the (110) plane of rutile, showing that the TiO2 nanorods grow along the (001) plane.

Fig. 2 displays the XRD pattern of the TiO2 nanorod arrays on the FTO substrate. All the diffraction peaks agree well with the tetragonal rutile phase (SG, P42/mmm; PDF no. 21-1278, a = b = 0.4593 nm and c = 0.2959 nm). Compared with the powder diffraction pattern, the (002) diffraction peak is significantly enhanced, and some diffraction peaks, including (110), (111) and (211), are absent, which indicates that the nanorod arrays are highly oriented with respect to the substrate surface and the TiO2 nanorods grow in the (001) direction with the growth axis parallel to the substrate surface. However, we can't find FTO substrate peaks because the maximum value of the X-ray diffraction depth in a film is about 1.0 μm, and the thin film which is 2.7 μm thick can't be penetrated.

In order to investigate the impact of different reaction times on the film morphology of the as-prepared samples, FESEM was used to examine the film morphology of different solvothermal reaction times. Fig. 3 shows the typical morphology of the Cu3BiS3 films prepared by a solvothermal route on the surface of the TiO2/FTO substrate in a mixed solution of glycerol and ethanol at 180 °C. As can be seen from Fig. 3a (the reaction time is 1 h), the TiO2 surface is covered by a few Cu3BiS3 petals which are composed of nanosheets, and most of the petals are single ones which haven't connected with each other to construct a film. From the partially enlarged detail (Fig. 3b), it can be seen that the Cu3BiS3 nanosheets connect with TiO2 by passing through the nanorods. However, when we chose flat TiO2 films and FTO as substrates, no Cu3BiS3 grew on the surface. We can conclude that passing through may be an easy way to connect Cu3BiS3 to TiO2. Fig. 3c shows the morphology of Cu3BiS3 nanosheets synthesized by a solvothermal route at 180 °C for 3 h, from which we can see that the surface of the TiO2 nanorod arrays has been covered by a uniform distributed network of interconnected nanosheets. Compared with flat thin films,16–18 this pattern film indicates a high surface area, which has potential applications in the areas of catalysis, sensors, and energy conversion. From the high magnification SEM image (Fig. 3d), it is clearly observed that the nanosheets are discoid and have a typical thickness of about 30 nm. Fig. 3e shows the cross-section image of Fig. 3c, which is rived from the middle of the as-prepared glass sample, from which we can see clearly the TiO2 and Cu3BiS3 bilayer on the FTO substrate and the thickness of TiO2 and Cu3BiS3 are 2.7 μm and 1.0 μm, respectively. Fig. 3f shows the morphology of the Cu3BiS3 film synthesized by the solvothermal route at 180 °C for 6 h, and we find that some porous microspheres grew on the surface of the Cu3BiS3 film, the average diameter of which is 800 nm, and this is different from the sample reacted for 3 h. In order to study the growth pattern of the Cu3BiS3 thin film, the powder morphologies of Cu3BiS3 in the thin film synthesis process with different reaction times were observed by SEM. The results show that we can obtain a crystalline powder for reaction times of 3 h and 6 h, but the powder can't be obtained for a reaction time of 1 h. The obtained powder is shown in the ESI†(Fig. S1). It can be seen that the powder is completely composed of porous microspheres, which are uniform in size with an average diameter of 800 nm, and the microspheres are also composed of nanosheets, the thickness of which is 30 nm. The results illustrate that the microspheres which grow on the surface of the film are the same as the obtained powder.

To further examine the impact of different reactant concentrations on the morphology of Cu3BiS3 on the surface of the TiO2 nanorods, FESEM was used to investigate the surface morphology details of the Cu3BiS3 film. Fig. 4a shows the FESEM images of the Cu3BiS3 film synthesized at a low mole number (the mole numbers of CuCl, Bi(NO3)3 and C2H6OS are 0.15 mmol, 0.05 mmol, and 0.15 mmol, respectively), and it can be seen that the film is still composed of nanosheets but these nanosheets are not discoid, and they are irregular. This may be caused by a decrease in the crystal nucleus and lead to the growth of irregular nanosheets at the same temperature. At a high mole number of reactants (the mole numbers of CuCl, Bi(NO3)3 and C2H6OS are 0.6 mmol, 0.2 mmol, and 0.6 mmol, respectively), the surface morphology of the film is as shown in Fig. 4c, and it can be seen that the film is not composed of nanosheets but nanoparticles. The crystal nucleus no longer grow to nanosheets due to the high concentration of reactants. Therefore, the regular nanosheets only grow on the TiO2 nanorod array at the appropriate reactant concentration (the mole numbers of CuCl, Bi(NO3)3 and C2H6OS are 0.3 mmol, 0.1 mmol, and 0.3 mmol, respectively), as shown in Fig. 4b.

(a) 0.15 mmol of CuCl, 0.05 mmol of Bi(NO3)3·5H2O, and 0.30 mmol of mercaptoethanol; (b) 0.30 mmol of CuCl, 0.10 mmol of Bi(NO3)3·5H2O, and 0.3 mmol of mercaptoethanol; (c) 0.60 mmol of CuCl, 0.20 mmol of Bi(NO3)3·5H2O, and 1.20 mmol of mercaptoethanol. 
The valence state information and composition analysis of the Cu3BiS3/TiO2 composite film (fabricated from 0.3 mmol of CuCl, 0.1 mmol of Bi(NO3)3 and of 0.3 mmol C2H6OS in a mixed solution of glycerol and ethanol at 180 °C for 3 h) are provided by XPS. The results in Fig. 5a show the presence of Cu, Bi, S, Ti and O elements in the sample. The Ti 2p, O 1s, S 2s, Bi 4f and Cu 2p core levels were also examined (Fig. 5b–e), respectively. It was observed that the binding energies of Ti 2p3/2 (457.9 eV), Bi 4f7/2 (157.9 eV), Bi 4f5/2 (163.3 eV) and S 2p (160.3 eV) in Fig. 5d and f shift slightly compared with those reported in the literature,24 which was ascribed to the charge-transfer between the Cu3BiS3 and TiO2. The S 2s (224.9 eV) peak in Fig. 5c can be assigned to S coordinated to Cu and Bi in Cu3BiS3, and the O 1s (529.5 eV) peak in Fig. 5e can be assigned to O in TiO2. In addition, the most important is the valence of Cu, and the binding energy of Cu 2p3/2 (931.9 eV) and Cu 2p1/2 (951.8 eV) can be assigned to Cu(I) coordinated to Cu and Bi in Cu3BiS3 (Fig. 5b), and the binding energy of Cu 2p3/2 for Cu(II), which is usually 942 eV according to the literature,25 does not appear in the high resolution spectra of Fig. 5b. Therefore, it can be concluded that only Cu(I) is in the sample. The valence state analysis results of the sample are Cu+, Bi3+ and S2−.

The crystal structures of the products were analyzed by XRD. Fig. 6 shows a typical XRD pattern of the Cu3BiS3 nanosheets peeled from the TiO2 film. All of the reflection peaks in the XRD pattern of the as-prepared sample at 2θ = 15.7°, 19.5°, 23.1°, 29.0°, 31.2°, 33.8° and 47.9° can be indexed to (011), (022), (111), (031), (131), (122) and (322) of a pure wittichenite phase of Cu3BiS3 (PDF card no. 43-1479, a = 7.696 Å, b = 10.388 Å, c = 6.71 Å). However, in the 2θ range of 20°–45°, there seems to be an unsystematic background. This may be caused by a series of main peaks which widened due to the bad crystallinity of the nanosheets, and this phenomenon is the same as the literature.26,27 No other impurities, such as binary sulfides, oxides, or hydroxides were detected by the XRD analysis, indicating the phase purity of the Cu3BiS3 product.

To further study the specific structure of the Cu3BiS3 nanosheets, TEM and HRTEM images of the obtained Cu3BiS3 film are presented in Fig. 7. The sample for the TEM characterization was obtained by scratching the Cu3BiS3/TiO2 film from the FTO glass. As can be seen from Fig. 7a, a cracked irregular Cu3BiS3 nanosheet is observed clearly under SEM, and from the corresponding image recorded by HRTEM, it can be seen that the nanosheet is crystalline, and the lattice fringes with an interplanar spacing of 0.285 nm is typical of the (131) planes of the Cu3BiS3 nanosheet, as illustrated in Fig. 7b.

The UV-vis absorption spectra of the TiO2 nanorod arrays and Cu3BiS3/TiO2 composite films are shown in Fig. 8. Curve A shows the typical TiO2 absorption spectra, and curve B is the absorption spectra of the Cu3BiS3/TiO2 composite film, and compared with curve A, the optical absorption is stronger. However, the energy gap of Cu3BiS3 is not easy to evaluate due as curve B is the absorption spectra of Cu3BiS3 and TiO2, and the absorption edge of Cu3BiS3 can't be found.

Due to the fact that Cu3BiS3 is a p-type semiconductor28–30 while TiO2 is an n-type semiconductor, it is easy to construct a p–n junction structure. However, the photoelectrochemical reaction can also be utilized due to the porousness of the TiO2 layer and Cu3BiS3 layer, and that the electrolyte solution (I2–KI) remains in the pores. The flowing current of the p–n junction and the photoelectrochemical reaction can happen at the same time when exposed to sunlight if possible. The current direction of the p–n junction cell is no doubt from the n-area (TiO2) to the p-area (Cu3BiS3), as shown in Fig. 9. The current direction of the photoelectrochemical cell is the same as that of the p–n junction cell. As shown in Fig. 9, I− is oxidized and the generated electron injected into the anode (TiO2), and I2 is reduced and the holes injected into the cathode (Cu3BiS3). The photoelectrical conversion efficiency can be easily increased if the two processes happen at the same time. We connected the anode with the FTO layer, and the Cu3BiS3 layer with the Pt transparent electrode, and the current is generated when the circuit is switched on.

The photocurrent–voltage (I–V) curves of the solar cells based on the TiO2 nanorod array absorbent layer and the Cu3BiS3/TiO2 composite film photoelectrodes with an active area of 0.78 cm2 under AM 1.5 illumination of 100 mW cm−2 for 20 cycles are shown in the ESI†(Fig. S2), and from the (I–V) curves, it is easy to evaluate the photoelectric conversion efficiency of a solar cell (η) by the equation as follows:31η = (FF × Isc × Voc)/Pinwhere Pin is the incident light power, Isc is the short-circuit current, Voc is the open-circuit voltage, and FF is the fill factor. FF is the important parameter, and it is the capacity of effective output power for a solar cell. The FF value can be evaluated from the equation:FF = Popt/(Isc × Voc)where Popt is the maximum output power.
The photovoltaic parameters are shown in Table 1. The bare TiO2 photoelectrodes indicate a short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) of 1.93 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.331 V, a fill factor (FF) of 61.3%, and a conversion efficiency of 0.519%, but the energy conversion efficiency of the Cu3BiS3/TiO2 composite film solar cell is 1.281%, which is significantly improved at almost twice that of a bare TiO2 nanorod array solar cell. The FF of the composite Cu3BiS3/TiO2 film photoelectrodes is 60.8%, which is a considerable magnitude compared with that of bare TiO2, showing that the capacity of the solar cell have also not been improved. All the figures above show that the Cu3BiS3 nanosheets growing on the surface of the TiO2 nanorod arrays can improve the energy conversion efficiency and application performance of a solar cell.

The characterization results of the photoelectric performance show that the Cu3BiS3 nanosheet can improve the application performance of the photoelectrode and the energy conversion efficiency of a Cu3BiS3/TiO2 nanosheet composite film photoelectrode is 1.281%, which is higher than that of TiO2 nanorod arrays. The fill factor of the composite film can reach 60.8%.
