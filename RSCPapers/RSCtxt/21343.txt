    , Accepted 28th August 2018First published on 1st September 2018AbstractFullerene cations, namely [60]fullerene radical cation (C60˙+) and organo[60]fullerenyl cation (RC60+), are less investigated as intermediates in synthetic fullerene chemistry because of the intrinsic electronegativity of C60. Remarkably, these two intermediates can mediate reactions that afford versatile, unique and unexpected fullerene derivatives. This review article mainly describes these C60˙+ and RC60+ intermediates and includes a variety of topics, from the generation of C60˙+ and RC60+ species to their applications in fullerene modification reactions, such as Friedel–Crafts hydroarylation, nucleophilic addition, dimerization, intramolecular rearrangement reactions, and intramolecular cyclization reactions. Additionally, this review deeply discusses the mechanism of the formation of unique [60]fullerene derivatives involving [60]fullerene radical cation and organo[60]fullerenyl cation intermediates. In addition, the electrochemical properties and photovoltaic performance of these fullerene derivatives produced through C60˙+ or RC60+-mediated reactions are discussed in this review.

1. Introduction
Since buckminsterfullerene (C60) first appeared on the scientific stage in 1985,1 much research and numerous investigations have been devoted to the functionalization and application of fullerene and its derivatives.2 It is now well accepted that C60 generally behaves like an electron-deficient olefin;3 thus, C60 can readily react with different nucleophilic reagents, such as active methylene compounds (BrCH(COOEt)2, the Bingel reaction),4 organometalics,2d,5 cyanide,6 carbanions generated by silyl enol ethers,7 and α-halocarbanions.8 By the same token, [60]fullerene and its derivatives can be selectively reduced to fullerene anions (e.g., C60n−, n = 1 to 6) by electrochemical reduction2a (constant voltage electrolysis or constant current electrolysis) or chemical reduction9–11 (alkali metals such as Li,9a K,9b,c Cs,9d and Rb,9e alkaline earth metals such as Ca10a and Ba,10b,c and other transition metals such as Hg11); the corresponding species can then behave as nucleophiles for further derivatization and functionalization.12 Additionally, [60]fullerene is remarkable due to its unique lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level, which is prone to undergo Diels–Alder reactions as a dienophile.13 Similarly, C60 can react with azomethine ylides based on 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition (the Prato reaction).14 It should be mentioned that a commercially available organic solar cell acceptor, phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM),15 is synthesized through 1,3-dipolar addition.16 Currently, fullerene radical-mediated reactions are also widely investigated and well developed. Fullerene radicals can be reliably generated by photonic processes,17 thermal processes18 and transition state metal-mediated processes.19–21 Among these three typical processes, the transition state metal-mediated process, including rhenium (Re),19 rhodium (Rh),20 and tungsten (W),21 is the most commonly utilized; this method has provided elegant examples of the functionalization of [60]fullerene.
Notably, fullerene cations are abundant in space and have been identified as significant interstellar molecular ions.22 Oddly, generating fullerene cations on a laboratory scale is challenging and difficult. In terms of frontier orbital theory, the LUMO of [60]fullerene allows it to accept 3 pairs of electrons to form corresponding fullerene anions.23 However, removal of the electrons located at the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) is highly unfavourable, which extremely hinders chemists from investigating fullerenyl cations, i.e., [60]fullerene radical cation (C60˙+) and organo[60]fullerenyl cation (RC60+). Intriguingly, organo[60]fullerenyl cation forms a new LUMO when one pair of electrons is removed from the previous HOMO. This new LUMO has a much lower energy level compared to the LUMO of pristine C60, which provides infinite room for further chemical modification of the [60]fullerene cage, such as reactions with nucleophiles with high yield and high selectivity,24 intramolecular rearrangements to form [60]fullerene derivatives with unique structures,25 and intramolecular cyclization to form special fullerene derivatives.26
In general, the electron affinity properties of [60]fullerene determine that it is not only prone to be reduced by accepting electrons, but also to undergo nucleophilic addition. When [60]fullerene obtains a single electron through electrochemical reduction or another single electron transfer (SET) process, it will form the fullerene radical anion (C60˙−). The formation of the organofullerene anion (RC60−) commonly occurs through the addition of nucleophiles (Fig. 1a). However, the [60]fullerene radical cation is extremely difficult to obtain through electrochemical oxidation or the SET pathway. Consequently, it is difficult to directly oxidize C60 to the corresponding fullerenyl cation through conventional organic synthetic methodologies. The protocol widely used to obtain the organo[60]fullerenyl cation is based on a two-step procedure starting from nucleophilic addition followed by an oxidation process, which provides organo[60]fullerenyl cations with versatile functional groups (RC60+, R = H, alkyl, aryl) (Fig. 1b). Although most research studies and examples of derivatization of [60]fullerenes involve [60]fullerene radical anion or organo[60]fullerene anion intermediates, [60]fullerene radical cation and organo[60]fullerenyl cation-mediated reactions are gradually attracting more attention because they provide facile access to unique fullerene derivatives that have not been previously reported through conventional methodologies.

This review article aims to discuss [60]fullerene derivatization methodologies based on the [60]fullerene radical cation and organo[60]fullerenyl cation as intermediates. Particularly, this review will detail strategies to generate the aforementioned fullerene cation intermediates, with a deep demonstration of the mechanism of the formation of these unique fullerene derivatives. In addition, the electrochemical properties and the photovoltaic performance of [60]fullerene derivatives obtained by fullerene cation intermediate-mediated reactions will be summarized and discussed. We hope this review will benefit scientists who have deep interests in fullerene chemistry and material science and will fill gaps in the fullerene cation chemistry literature.
2. Early-stage studies on fullerene cation species
Theoretical calculations of the HOMO level of pristine C60 indicate that its ionization and oxidation potentials are comparable to those of naphthalene.23 Consequently, the direct oxidation of C60 to C60˙+ or higher oxidation state fullerene is extremely difficult and challenging. Despite encountering severe difficulties, pioneering scientists have impressively developed several protocols to generate fullerene cation intermediates since the last century. This section mainly presents early-stage work and examples of fullerene chemistry based on fullerene cation intermediates.
The first organo[60]fullerenyl cation-mediated reaction was reported by the Olah group in 1991.27,28 They developed an aluminum chloride (AlCl3)-mediated Friedel–Crafts (F–C) hydroarylation reaction between C60 and benzene or toluene (Fig. 2). The key intermediate of this protocol was the hydro[60]fullerenyl cation (HC60+), which was generated by the addition of a proton during the reaction. Based on their experimental results, they proposed a possible mechanism for the Friedel–Crafts hydroarylation reaction. This reaction was initialized by the protonation of fullerene to obtain the key intermediate, HC60+, which subsequently underwent electrophilic arylation by benzene or toluene to produce the corresponding arylated [60]fullerene derivative as a mixture; this was summarized as C60ArnHn (Ar = C6H5−, MeC6H4−; n = 1 to 3, 6, 12, 16). However, Olah et al. failed to explain the proton source for the protonation of C60. The characterization of the products was unclear due to the poor selectivity of this methodology and the difficulties in separating each isomer. Subsequently, Mueller et al. clearly characterized the structure of HC60+ by establishing through-bonded connectivity in solids with nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and conducting a dynamic investigation of this phenomenon.29 Despite the obvious drawbacks of this Friedel–Crafts hydroarylation protocol, it undoubtedly provided a pioneering strategy for chemists to further investigate AlCl3-mediated F–C fullerene hydroarylation and opened a gate for further research on organo[60]fullerenyl cation species.

The first long-lived organo[60]fullerenyl cation was successfully synthesized and unambiguously characterized by Avent et al. in 1998 (Fig. 3).30 They treated pentaaryl[60]fullerene derivatives, C60Ar5Cl (Ar = C6H5−, 4-FC6H4−), with AlCl3 in a solution of CH2Cl2, CHCl3 or CS2 at room temperature to form pentaaryl[60]fullerenyl cations, Ar5C60+. The in situ1H NMR spectra of the above reaction solutions showed unique particularities of the Cs symmetrical signal, which demonstrated the successful generation of the Ar5C60+ species. Notably, 1,2-phenyl migration occurred after the abstraction of a chlorine atom from 1. Nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) data showed equal saturation transfer of all five aryl rings in product 4, implying the existence of a dynamic equilibrium between the initial arylfullerenyl cation 3 and the product 4. The in situ13C NMR spectra of the generated pentaarylfullerenyl cation 4 showed 54 sp2 fullerene carbons (26 × 2C and 2 × 1C), 5 sp3 fullerene carbons (2 × 2C and 1 × 1C) and one fullerene carbocationic carbon (1 × 1C+) in addition to the carbons of the pentaaryl addends. Understandably, the chemical shifts of the aryl groups of Ar5C60+ were located in a much lower field because the carbon atoms bear positive charges in 4. Accordingly, this conclusive observation of organo[60]fullerenyl cation encouraged further investigations on the scope, properties, spectroscopy and chemical reactivity of organo[60]fullerenyl cation intermediates. Subsequently, Taylor's group utilized 3He NMR spectra to measure the fullerenyl cations of endohedral 3He fullerene (3He@C60) derivatives, which were similarly generated by addition of AlCl3.31 In their study, they summarized general trends of an increase in 3He shielding with increasing number of addends and a decrease in shielding on forming the cation.

Later, Kitagawa and co-workers extended the functional group tolerance of organo[60]fullerenyl cations and fully characterized the generated products.32,33 They treated pristine C60 with 100 eq. AlCl3 in a solution of chloroform at 20 °C to form the corresponding chlorinated fullerene derivatives 5, which subsequently underwent hydrolysis through a silica gel plug with CS2 as the eluent to obtain the fullerenols346 (Fig. 4). Next, the fullerenol derivatives 6 were protonated by CF3COOH, and the alkyl[60]fullerenyl cations 7 were finally formed with the loss of a water molecule. They conclusively verified the reliable generation of organo[60]fullerenyl cations by 13C NMR spectroscopy. The 13C NMR spectrum of 7a showed 29 aromatic signals in the range of δ 137 to 154 ppm, indicating the unique Cs symmetry of the organo[60]fullerenyl cation, which was changed from the C1 symmetry of 6a by the loss of a hydroxyl group. Notably, the 13C NMR chemical shift of the cationic center on C60 of 7a dramatically downshifted to δ 175.6 ppm, which can be unambiguously explained by the electron-withdrawing properties of the organo[60]fullerenyl cation. In 2002, Kitagawa and Komatsu et al. extended the substrate scope of organo[60]fullerenyl cations and deeply investigated the thermodynamic stabilities of organo[60]fullerenyl cations.33 They presented an elegant method based on the kinetics of SN1 solvolysis reactions of 5a–d to rationally measure the thermodynamic stabilities of organo[60]fullerenyl cations 7a–d. In addition, they successfully reacted the in situ-generated organo[60]fullerenyl cations 7b–d with 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol (TFE) in a solution of anisole; the products 8b–d and 9b–d were obtained in over 80% total yields with a 1,4-addition pattern. It is worthwhile to note that when the fullerene anions were reacted with TFE, all the products were hydro[60]fullerenes. These intriguing findings revealed the fundamental properties of the organo[60]fullerenyl cation and provided a method not only for the development of RC60+-mediated reactions, but also provided methodologies to install different functional groups on fullerenes.
 Fig. 4  Organo[60]fullerenyl cations generated from [60]fullerenols. 
Although the synthesis of fullerenols was successfully achieved, fullerenols are still relatively rare materials, which dramatically limits the scalable synthesis of fullerenol-based organo[60]fullerenyl cations. In 2004, the Komatsu group further reported the generation of organo[60]fullerenyl cations from monofunctionalized hydrofullerenes, RC60-H, which can be readily synthesized by a variety of strategies (Fig. 5).35 When they treated a hydrofullerene derivative with H2SO4 at room temperature under ambient atmosphere, a reddish-purple solution was obtained, which vividly demonstrated the generation of the fullerenyl cationic species rather than a dark-green solution of fullerene anionic species. The 13C NMR spectrum apparently showed 29 signals in the region between 152.05 and 136.28 ppm with a fullerene sp3-C symbolic signal at 53.66 ppm, evidently indicating Cs symmetry of the fullerenyl cation species. Intriguingly, quenching the solution with CF3CH2OH provided fullerenyl ethers RC60-OCH2CF3 in high yields as a mixture of 1,2-adducts (10) and 1,4-adducts (11). When the substrates contained bulky substitution groups, only 1,4-adducts (12, 13) were obtained in high yield due to steric effects. It is worth noting that they presented the first example of a singly-bonded fullerene dimer for the generation of fullerenyl cation species. In this protocol, they concluded that the key step to obtain the fullerene dimer-generated fullerenyl cation was the single electron oxidation step. Notably, the phosphine atom in the precursor played a vital role in this reaction. This may be due to coordination of the phosphoryl group to the cationic center, which stabilizes the highly reactive fullerenyl cationic species. Although the necessity of the phosphorous group limited the substrate scope, this first fullerene dimer-generated fullerenyl cation provided a supplementary methodology for the efficient generation of fullerenyl cations. Thereafter, the Petrukhina group presented a comprehensive theoretical investigation on functionalized cations, RC60+, from a variety of aspects, including the structures, energetics and properties of RC60+; this provided further insights on experimental and theoretical research as well as practical applications.36

In addition to the organo[60]fullerenyl cation (RC60+), the fullerenyl radical cation (C60˙+) has also been well investigated. The first observation of fullerene radical cation was accomplished by the Huffman group through electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra in 1991.37 C60˙+ was produced by partially dissolving pristine C60 in a solution of concentrated sulphuric acid (98% H2SO4) or fuming sulfuric acid (20% free SO3). The recorded g value of C60˙+ was 2.0030, which referred to 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (g = 2.0037) and was only slightly greater than that of the free electron. Similarly, so-called ‘Magic Acid’ (FSO3H:SbF5) was also capable of oxidizing C60 to its radical cation.38 Intriguingly, the generated fullerene radical cation can be trapped with nucleophiles to obtain nucleophilic addition products, such as two, four, and six addends, symmetrically added onto the fullerene cage through a fullerene radical cation-mediated pathway. Later, the Muller group introduced the superacid H(CB11H6X6) (where X = chlorine or bromine) to obtain hydro[60]fullerenyl cation and fullerene radical cation.39 When C60 was treated with the superacid under oxidant-free conditions, stable HC60+ was obtained and observed. On the other hand, the superacid has powerful oxidizing capacity; thus, the conjugate base (CB11H6X6−) can function as an oxidant to oxidize C60 to C60˙+.
In addition to the abovementioned oxidative acids for the formation of fullerene radical cations, the Fukuzumi group reported the first electron spin resonance (ESR) detection of C60˙+ in a system containing FeCl3.40 They introduced C60 into an Fe3+-exchanged zeolite Y sample; an intense ESR signal at g = 2.0027 was observed, and no ESR signal was observed at this position in the absence of C60 (Fig. 6). Notably, this g value was different from those of C60˙− (g = 2.000)41 and triplet C60 (g = 2.0014).42 In addition, when they increased the amount of Fe3+ loaded in the zeolite, the intensity of the corresponding ESR signal increased. Through the combination of these two pieces of evidence, they conclusively confirmed the formation of [60]fullerene radical cation (C60˙+). This extraordinary work paved the road for later investigation of fullerene radical cation-based chemistry and opened a gate for the effective generation of fullerene radical cations.

The electrochemical reduction of [60]fullerene from C60− to C606− was successfully conducted by cyclic voltammetry (CV);44–49 the characteristics of the [60]fullerene LUMO perfectly matched predictions based on theoretical computations.23 However, the electrochemical oxidation of [60]fullerene was not achieved until 1993 by the Echegoyen group.50 They conducted CV experiments under extremely high-vacuum conditions (∼10−5 mmHg) and strictly processed all solvents and reagents by de-gas and de-water procedures before use. The first reversible oxidative wave of C60 was found at +1.26 V vs. ferrocene (Fc+/Fc) as the internal reference in a solution of 0.1 M n-Bu4NPF6/1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane at room temperature; this vividly demonstrated the generation of the fullerene radical cation. Further electrochemical oxidation failed to afford fullerene di-cations or even higher oxidation states of fullerene, which evidently shows the difficulty of direct electrochemical oxidation of [60]fullerene. A decade later, the Zaopo group adopted ultra-dry solvents and electrolytes with very high oxidation resistances and low nucleophilicities to further electro-oxidize [60]fullerene, successfully obtaining its di-cation (C602+) and tri-cation (C603+).51 Although electrochemical oxidation-generated fullerene cations are very difficult to handle for use in organic synthesis, this method provides a way to investigate the electrochemical properties of fullerene cations. Moreover, electrochemical oxidation can afford the corresponding cations of higher fullerenes, such as C70, C76, and C78.2b,52
In addition to the direct electrochemical oxidation performed by electrolysis, an elegant direct chemical oxidation method was presented by Choi's group.53 This facile chemical oxidation of C60 was achieved through spontaneous SET from C60 to Au ions (Au3+) triggered by the energy difference between the Fermi energy level of C60 (−4.7 eV) and the standard reduction potential of Au3+ ion (+1.002 V). In addition, this work afforded an alternate method to fabricate fullerene-engaged field effect transistors (FET).
Considering that [60]fullerenes have excellent photochemical characteristics, the Yagci group achieved in situ generation of C60˙+via photo-induced chemistry (Fig. 7).54 They introduced fullerene cationic polymerization using bare C60 or polystyrene-C60 as light-absorbing molecules in the presence of oxidants, such as silver hexafluorophosphate (AgPF6) or diphenyl iodonium hexafluoro-phosphate (PhI+PF6−), which successfully produced [60]fullerene-polymers.

In general, even though the above early-stage studies on [60]fullerene cation species failed to provide fullerene derivatives in high yields or even afforded much poorer results compared to reactions with [60]fullerene anions and radicals, these studies undoubtedly provided early information and potential strategies for the later research and development of fullerene cation intermediates. In the following sections, we will discuss many elegant studies with extremely attractive results enlightened by these original pioneering examples.
3. General strategies for generation of fullerene cation intermediates
[60]Fullerene cation intermediates can be generally divided into two specific species, the organo[60]fullerenyl cation (RC60+) and the [60]fullerene radical cation (C60˙+). In this section, we will present the general strategies for the formation of the organo[60]fullerenyl cation and [60]fullerene radical cation, respectively. In addition, deep discussion of each strategy and a brief introduction to [60]fullerene cation intermediate-mediated reactions will be presented. Detailed illustrations will be exemplified and discussed in each following section.
3.1 Organo[60]fullerenyl cation (RC60+)
Organo[60]fullerenyl cation is the most popular and readily operated [60]fullerene cation intermediate. As we previously discussed, early stage studies presented elegant AlCl3-mediated organo[60]fullerenyl cation generation by Friedel–Crafts type reactions.27,28 However, all the fullerene derivatives produced by this Friedel–Crafts type reaction contained fullerenyl protons; it is well-known that the fullerenyl proton is harmful to the stability of fullerene derivatives.55 In addition to the hydrofullerenyl cation (HC60+), versatile organic groups were successfully introduced to the organo[60]fullerenyl cation (RC60+, R = alkyl, aryl, etc.) based on a Cu[II]-mediated process, which mainly includes two steps. Firstly, the installation of different functional groups is achieved by nucleophilic addition, producing the corresponding hydro[60]fullerene derivatives (I) (Fig. 8). Then, the fullerene derivatives I are deprotonated by the base, correspondingly forming the organo[60]fullerene anion intermediates RC60− (II), which are subsequently oxidized by Cu[II] to generate RC60+ with high selectivity. Synthetically speaking, a dimerization step can be readily inserted before the final generation of RC60+, which can increase the yield and selectivity of continuous processes. After formation of the organo[60]fullerene anion intermediates II, oxidants were introduced to oxidize II to form radicals, which were immediately coupled to produce the organofullerene dimers (III) in quantitative yield. Satisfyingly, these dimers III can be easily purified using a silica gel plug. Finally, the dimers III underwent further oxidation by Cu[II] to produce RC60+.
 Fig. 8  Cu[II]-Mediated organo[60]fullerenyl cation generation. 
To oxidise the fullerene anion intermediates II to RC60+, a pair of electrons located at the HOMO were removed to generate a new LUMO (Fig. 9). Importantly, this newly formed LUMO can enable (a) intramolecular rearrangements because of the interaction between the LUMO and the π-electrons of the arenes;25 (b) intramolecular cyclization because of the interaction between the LUMO and the lone pair electrons of the heteroatoms56 or electrons from the π-orbital of carbon.26

3.2 Fullerene radical cation (C60˙+)
Although Fukuzumi et al. confirmed the existence of C60˙+ through ESR measurements,40 the fullerene radical cation cannot be generated if electrochemical properties are taken into deep consideration. The reduction potential of Fe3+/Fe2+ is +0.77 V vs. standard hydrogen electrode (SHE).39,50 However, the reduction potential of C60˙+/C60 is +2.03 V vs. SHE (C60˙+/C60 is +1.26 V vs. Fc+/Fc at room temperature).57 Consequently, it is impossible for FeCl3 to oxidize C60 to C60˙+ if we only refer to the electrochemistry parameters. It should be highlighted that FeCl3 plays a special role in the oxidation of [60]fullerene by two different plausible pathways (Fig. 10). (a) Coordination of the chlorine atom of FeCl3 to C60 changes the electronic properties of C60, which drives electron transfer from C60 to FeCl3, generating C60˙+, FeCl2 and chloride anion (Cl−). Subsequently, C60˙+ and Cl− can form a resting state radical, C60Cl˙. Another FeCl3 molecule reacts with C60Cl˙ as a Lewis acid to capture Cl−, producing FeCl4 and C60˙+. It should be noted that this counter anion FeCl4− benefits the formation of C60˙+ by stabilizing the [60]fullerene radical cation. (b) The chloride anion (Cl−), generated by the decomposition of FeCl3, can first attach to C60 to form the chlorofullerene anion (C60Cl−). C60Cl− is then oxidized by FeCl3, producing the C60Cl˙ radical species, which can spontaneously undergo C–Cl bond cleavage to produce the fullerene radical cation (C60˙+) and chloride anion (Cl−). The generated C60˙+ can further undergo a Friedel–Crafts reaction58 or fullerene dimerization reaction,59 or it can even react with the carboxylic acid to produce the fullerenyl ester.60

In brief, compared with the early stage studies on fullerene cation intermediates, contemporary methodologies can generate fullerene cation intermediates more smoothly and efficiently. In the following section, numerous examples of fullerene cation intermediates will be presented and deeply discussed.
4. Aluminium chloride (AlCl3)-mediated reactions
Aluminium chloride (AlCl3)-mediated fullerene reactions were the first successful reactions based on the hydro[60]fullerenyl cation (HC60+). However, the early stage AlCl3-mediated Friedel–Crafts reaction was unsuitable for industrial use because of its poor selectivity, low yields and difficulties in purifying the products.27,28 The authors’ group first achieved the Friedel–Crafts reaction in synthetically viable yields in 2007.24 In our work, we found that the hydroarylated fullerene derivatives were air-sensitive under ambient light, which readily explained the failure of characterization in early stage studies. Additionally, we clarified that the proton source for the formation of HC60+ is the HCl produced by the in situ hydrolysis of AlCl3. This in situ-generated HCl was further activated by the removal of chloride anion by an Al[III] species to form a very reactive proton source. During a screen of the reactivity of different benzene derivatives, we found that electron-withdrawing group-substituted benzene derivatives stopped the reaction selectively at the monohydroarylation stage (Fig. 11). For example, the reaction of C60 with chlorobenzene in the presence of AlCl3 selectively produced C60(4-ClC6H4)H (14). It is understandable that strong electron-withdrawing group-substituted benzene derivatives, such as 1,2-dichlorobenzene and trifluoromethylbenzene, are unreactive. In contrast, when reacting electron-donating group-substituted benzene derivatives, the reaction proceeded to the dihydroarylation stage. When an excess amount of toluene was introduced into the reaction, the reaction ended at the trihydroarylation stage, producing two isomers 17a and 17b in a ratio of 4:1. Heating of a mixture of 17a,b at 80 °C only afforded product 17b, which suggests that the derivative 17b is more thermodynamically stable than 17a.

Intriguingly, the hydroaryl[60]fullerene derivatives 17a,b can be converted into a single η5-organometallic complex,61 which enables structural assignment without the need for single crystal X-ray diffraction (Fig. 13). We treated a mixture of 17a,b with tBuOK in THF and then introduced [RuCl2(CO)3]2 and [RuCp(MeCN)3][PF6] (Cp: cyclopentadienyl), affording Ru{C60(4-MeC6H4)3H2}Cl(CO)2 and [Ru{C60(4-MeC6H4)3H2}Cp(MeCN)3][PF6], respectively.
This method was applied not only to intact [60]fullerene, but also to functionalized [60]fullerene derivatives. We conducted this protocol on C60(CH2SiMeOiPr)H (24) with five equivalents of AlCl3 in a solution of toluene (Fig. 12). A mixture of C60(4-MeC6H4)2(CH2SiMeOiPr)H3 (25a,b) was obtained in a total yield of 57%.

In general, by controlling the electron negativity of the benzene derivatives, this methodology can be used to efficiently and selectively produce hydroaryl[60]fullerene derivatives, which provides a pattern for 1,4-addition of diaryl[60]fullerene derivatives for use in organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices.62
5. Iron(III) chloride (FeCl3)-mediated reactions
Because the associated behaviour of chloride and Fe(III) plays a special role in [60]fullerene radical cation chemistry, inexpensive FeCl3 can reliably generate C60˙+in situ to mediate fullerene reactions.58–60,63,64 Although the AlCl3-mediated Friedel–Crafts reaction is a facile strategy to synthesize arylated fullerene derivatives, it fails to introduce only aryl groups to the C60 cage because hydrogenation always proceeds synchronously. Satisfactorily, the FeCl3-mediated Friedel–Crafts reaction can afford perfect penta-arylated derivatives without the existence of the fullerenyl proton, which is well accepted to be detrimental to the stability of the corresponding fullerene derivatives. The first trial was reported by the Cooks group in 1991.63 They investigated the Friedel–Crafts reaction in the presence of FeCl3 and bromine. Disappointingly, adequate characterization of the products was not possible because of the complicated mixtures of the resulting products. In addition, the large amount of remaining C60 was too problematic for this protocol to be utilized for synthetic purposes.
The first applicable FeCl3-mediated polyarylation of [60]fullerene was presented by the authors’ group using aryl halides with a facile synthetic procedure.58 Reaction of C60 with versatile halogenated benzene derivatives in the presence of FeCl3 yielded a mixture of arylated products. Although the products were a mixture (5 ≤ number of aryl groups ≤ 10), the conversion of C60 was almost quantitative and the major products, penta(aryl)[60]fullerenes (26a–d), could be easily purified; this provides industry with a convenient and reliable fullerene modification method (Fig. 14).
 Fig. 14  Functionalization of C60 by halogenated benzenes in the presence of FeCl3. 
It should be mentioned that there are two plausible pathways for the production of the penta(aryl)[60]fullerenes (26a–d). One is a hydroarylation–oxidation mechanism that resembles the AlCl3-mediated Friedel–Crafts reaction of C60,24,27,28 while the other is a fullerene radical cation-mediated mechanism. In the former mechanism, the hydroarylation of C60 occurs in the presence of FeCl3 to produce the hydro[60]fullerenyl cation HC60+ (Fig. 15). The HC60+ further undergoes a Friedel–Crafts reaction with an arene to afford the arylhydrofullerene, C60ArH. This hydroarylated product is oxidized by FeCl3 to generate the arylfullerenyl cation, ArC60+, which undergoes a second Friedel–Crafts reaction to afford a diarylfullerene, C60Ar2.62 The same procedure is repeated on C60Ar2 to produce the pentaarylated fullerenyl cation, C60Ar5+,30 which is finally chlorinated to yield C60Ar5Cl. By arylation on C60Ar5Cl, poly(aryl)fullerenes with more than five aryl groups were produced.
 Fig. 15  The hydroarylation and oxidation mechanisms. 
Because FeCl3 plays a special role in the fullerene radical cation reaction, this reaction can be similarly achieved by a C60˙+-mediated reaction (Fig. 16). Single electron transfer (SET) occurs from C60 to FeCl3 to generate the [60]fullerene radical cation intermediate, as articulated in Section 3.2. The active [60]fullerene radical cation intermediate takes part in the Friedel–Crafts reaction to generate the arylfullerene radical ArC60˙. FeCl3 further oxidizes this arylfullerene radical to afford the corresponding arylfullerenyl cation, which subsequently reacts with the arene to produce the diarylfullerene, C60Ar2. Moreover, C60Ar2 undergoes oxidation and a Friedel–Crafts reaction, finally producing the chlorinated penta(aryl)fullerene. The procedure is repeated on the products to produce poly(aryl)fullerenes with more than five aryl groups.
 Fig. 16  The fullerene radical cation-mediated pathway. 
C120, an all-carbon fullerene dimer, was first reported by the Komatsu group in 1997.65 Although high-speed vibration milling provided C120 with acceptable yield and selectivity, the necessity of the ball milling machine limited the scaleup of this reaction. Subsequently, the authors’ group presented an inexpensive and environmentally benign FeCl3-mediated solution phase synthesis of dumbbell-shaped C120.59 For the procedure proposed by the Komatsu group, the solid-phase synthesis was mediated by cyano[60]fullerene anion, which was generated by KCN. Conversely, the procedure reported by the authors’ group involved a fullerene radical cation pathway (Fig. 17). At the beginning, as in the previous generation of C60˙+, single electron transfer oxidation was induced by FeCl3, which then generated the fullerene radical cation for the subsequent coupling process. Afterward, C60˙+ formed a covalent bond with neutral C60, producing the key intermediate C60˙–C60+ (IV), which then abstracted an electron from another C60 to produce the [60]fullerene dumbbell-shaped dimer C120 (27).
 Fig. 17  Fullerene radical cation-mediated synthesis of C120 in solution phase. 
Fullerenyl esters, another interesting class of material which is applied in low-LUMO level acceptors of OPV devices, have been investigated by many groups during the past decades.66 In contrast to previous work, the authors’ group first provided an FeCl3-mediated method for the facile synthesis of fullerene esters with broad functional group tolerance (Fig. 18).60 In this work, we screened additional Lewis acids, oxidants, and iron complexes (AlCl3, RuCl3, BF3·Et2O, CuCl2, FeCl2, ZnCl2, Fe(acac)3, and Fe(ClO4)3). However, no desired fullerenyl esters were obtained after replacement of FeCl3, which suggests that this reaction is mediated by a special oxidative effect of FeCl3 toward [60]fullerene.
 Fig. 18  FeCl3-Mediated synthesis of [60]fullerenyl esters. 
With the hydroxy[60]fullerenyl ester (28a) in hand, we performed functional group transformation on the derivative 28a (Fig. 19). The synthesis of fullerenyl esters from fullerenols is generally straightforward and facile. Treatment of fullerenol 28a with benzoyl chloride and trimethylsilyl chloride produced the low-LUMO-level [60]fullerene acceptors 29 and 30, respectively.
 Fig. 19  Synthesis of fullerenyl esters as low-LUMO-level acceptors. 
With continuous interest in the FeCl3-mediated fullerene reaction, we found that FeCl3 can impressively mediate retro Diels–Alder reactions of various fullerene derivatives (Fig. 20).64 The indene C60 monoadduct (ICMA) and the phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) were selected as examples to present this retro Diels–Alder reaction of fullerene derivatives. Notably, other Lewis acids (RuCl3, BF3·Et2O, FeCl2, NiCl2, CoCl2, and ZnCl2) as well as p-toluenesulfonic acid were ineffective in this process. It should be mentioned that AlCl3 showed weak reactivity, with a conversion rate of less than 10%. These retro Diels–Alder reactions of fullerene may involve a fullerene radical cation pathway; however, the overall reaction mechanism remains mysterious.
 Fig. 20  FeCl3-mediated retro Diels–Alder reactions of fullerene derivatives. 
According to the presented examples, most reactions enabled by the usage of FeCl3 are related to fullerene radical cation intermediates, although the mechanisms of some reactions are still unclear. In general, FeCl3-mediated fullerene reactions can reliably generate C60˙+ to install versatile functional groups on the fullerene cage; this broadens the candidate scope of fullerene acceptors in OPV devices.
6. Copper(II)-mediated reactions
Compared to the AlCl3 and FeCl3-mediated organo[60]fullerenyl cation reactions, the Cu[II]-mediated reaction shows superiority not only in the high yield and selectivity of the reaction, but also in the production of unique fullerene structures. Generally, the Cu[II]-mediated pathway usually involves an intramolecular rearrangement or intramolecular cyclization, producing numerous fullerene derivatives with special structures and properties. Unlike the organo[60]fullerenyl cation generated by the AlCl3-mediated reaction, the Cu[II]-mediated procedure can tolerate a broad substrate scope, generating the organo[60]fullerenyl cation RC60+versus the HC60+ cation generated by AlCl3. Abundant types of organo[60]fullerenyl cations can be achieved by the broad substrate scope of RC60H, which benefits from the Grignard addition onto the fullerene cage presented by the authors’ group.5e
The common strategy to build fullerene acceptors used in OPV devices is based on control of the electronic state and morphology by addition of organic addends onto the fullerene cage. However, with multi addends onto to the fullerene cage, which improve the open-circuit voltage (VOC) by raising the LUMO level,67,68 the short-circuit current (JSC) and filling factor (FF) decrease because the addends inevitably change the fullerene-fullerene contact distance. Satisfactorily, methano[60]fullerene (C61H2) is the most stable and the smallest 1,2-disubstituted fullerene derivative; thus, some fullerene acceptors include the methano unit (Fig. 21).26,69,70
 Fig. 21  Fullerene acceptors containing a methano[60]fullerene unit. 
Although many groups have achieved the synthesis of C61H2 (35), their yields were too low to be applied in industry.71 In 2011, the authors’ group reported the first scalable synthesis of C61H2 by the oxidative cyclopropanation reaction of silylmethylfullerene (Fig. 21).26 This method overcame the difficulty of separation of C61H2 from pristine C60 because the chromatographic behaviour of the silylmethylfullerene (24) was completely different from those of both the starting C60 and the produced C61H2; thus, C61H2 was readily obtained in a highly pure form. In addition to the one-step oxidation procedure, this method can be conducted by a higher-yielding two-step method involving a fullerene dimer (37) which is obtained in stoichiometric yield by oxidation of organo[60]fullerene anion (36) with N-chlorosuccinimide (NCS) or I2. Then, heating dimer 37 at 100 °C for 4 h in the presence of CuCl2 affords C61H2 in quantitative yield (Fig. 22).
 Fig. 22  Synthesis of C61H2 from silylmethylfullerene and its dimer. 
Interestingly, this method can also be applied to previously functionalized fullerene derivatives; this affords 56-π-electron methanofullerene derivatives with higher LUMO levels (Fig. 23). Isopropoxy(dimethyl)silylmethyl Grignard reagent selectively attacked the 1,4-position of one of the addends of dialkylfullerenes to afford a single product (39). The Cu(II)-mediated cyclization reaction produced a methano compound (31) as a single isomer of a 56-π-electron fullerene derivative. This is different from ordinary 56-π-electron bisadducts, such as indene-C60 bisadduct (ICBA), which are obtained as a mixture of isomers.68 A similar reaction with diarylfullerene (40) was also demonstrated to convert 41 to 42.
 Fig. 23  Synthesis of 56-π-electron methanofullerene derivatives. 
When the isopropoxyl moiety of 24 was replaced by arenes, the reaction involved an intramolecular 1,4-aryl migration of any aryl group from the silicon atom to the fullerene cage, producing noncyclic 1,2-di(organo)fullerene derivatives.25 Generally, when bulkier groups are substituted on the fullerene cage, the major structure of the fullerene derivative follows the 1,4-addition pattern.72–74 Notably, the authors’ group achieved the 1,2-adduct with bulk substituents by exploiting the ability of arylsilane to function as an intramolecular donor of an aryl group to the organo[60]fullerenyl cation intermediate (Fig. 24).
 Fig. 24  CuCl2-Mediated intramolecular migration. 
By using different substituted (phenyldimethyl)-silylmethylfullerene derivatives (43), migrated products (45) and cyclization products (35) can be obtained in different ratios. Increasing the number of phenyl moieties on the silicon atom (43) resulted in higher yields of the migrated compounds. Additionally, when more electron-rich aryl groups are present on the silicon atom of 43, the reaction can result in exclusive formation of the arylated products in high yield. Table 2 summarizes this method, which has a wide substrate scope.

Recently, our group reported Cu[II]- and I2-mediated cyclization reactions to obtain oxygen-containing 5- and 7-membered cyclo[60]fullerene derivatives.56 We used 44d as an oxygen-containing substrate to investigate the cyclization. Similarly, when the reaction was conducted in the presence of CuBr2, the major product was the migrated compound 45d; this is due to the effect of the halide generated from the copper salt. Therefore, upon replacing the Cu[II] salt with iodine, the reaction exclusively afforded the 7-member ring cyclized derivative 46 in high yield. Based on these two apparently contradictory phenomena, we proposed that the production of migrated product 45d was due to the coordinated effect of bromide, which stabilized the silyl cation to a significant degree. However, when iodine was used as the oxidant, only the cyclized derivative was obtained. The radius of iodine is too large to stabilize the silyl cation; thus, the oxygen atom in the substituent coordinated to the silyl cation to form the onium intermediate, which subsequently produced the cyclized compound 46 (Fig. 25).
 Fig. 25  I2-Promoted 7-member cyclization. 
Later, we reconsidered the procedure for the synthesis of C61H2, whose substrate contained oxygen and silicon atoms. As discussed before, the silicon cation can be stabilized by halides, such as bromide and chloride; we conducted this reaction under the same conditions as the procedure to produce C61H2, except for the presence of methanol (3.0 v/v%) as an additive (Fig. 26). With the addition of methanol, the major product was the 5-membered oxygen-containing ring derivative 47, although C61H2 was also obtained in 9% yield. This result demonstrated the exchange of alkoxy groups from the isopropoxy group to the methoxy group on the silicon atom in the presence of methanol. Compared to the isopropoxy group, the halide can easily access the methyl group, and demethylation proceeded to form the cyclized derivative 47. Analogously, in the reaction to obtain the 7-membered cyclized products, the onium intermediate next to the silicon atom was involved in the cyclization procedure.
 Fig. 26  Proposed mechanism for the synthesis of 47. 
We further investigated the reaction scope using the aryl[60]fullerene dimer, which does not contain a silicon atom. Intriguingly, cyclization was also smoothly achieved despite the absence of the silicon atom, affording the benzofurano[60]fullerene derivative 49 (Fig. 27). Although elegant synthetical methodologies of benzofuranofullerene have been reported,75,76 an organofullerenyl cation-mediated example was not proposed until this method was presented. Unlike that with the previous silicon-containing substrate, this reaction did not involve a Si-onium intermediate. After generation of the fullerene radical by heating of the dimer 48, the fullerene radical was oxidized by CuBr2 to afford the organofullerenyl cation and bromide. Then, the bromide acted as a demethylation reagent, enhancing the cyclization procedure to finally afford 49.
 Fig. 27  Proposed mechanism for the synthesis of benzofurano[60]fullerene. 
Notably, all the previously mentioned examples of Cu[II]-mediated reactions are intra-molecular reactions. Very recently, the authors’ group presented the usage of Cu[II] (Cu(BF4)2(aq.) or CuBr2) to conduct intermolecular coupling reactions between aryl[60]fullerenyl cation and various functionalized boronic acids (Fig. 28).77 Importantly, this method produced the corresponding 1,4-diaryl[60]fullerenes in high yields up to 93% regardless of whether the system contained water. In addition, installation of highly reactive functional groups such as amino and hydroxy groups can be successfully achieved without the necessity for protection/deprotection strategies. Finally, an organic electronic application was introduced to evaluate these new amino[60]fullerene derivatives.78 We fabricated a perovskite solar cell (PSC) with 0.1 wt% of 50b as dopant; the power conversion efficiency of the device was enhanced to 13.5%, higher than that of a reference (12.7%). The reason that these amino[60]fullerene derivatives can effectively enhance the performance of a PSC is the amino group in the molecule 50b, which can passivate CH3NH3PbI3; this improves both the JSC and FF.
 Fig. 28  Intermolecular coupling reactions between aryl[60]fullerene cations and boronic acids. 
In general, Cu[II] salts play key roles in the generation of organo[60]fullerenyl cations with excellent selectivity and high yield. Using organic nucleophilic reagents, such as organolithium and Grignard reagents, various functionalized organo[60]fullerenyl cations can be easily obtained compared to the AlCl3 and FeCl3-mediated methodologies. In addition, the Cu[II]-mediated pathway impressively produces unique, unexpected structures and derivatives when fullerenyl anion or radical-mediated reactions are applied; this provides great potential to obtain fullerene-based materials. Accordingly, there will be more interesting studies based on the Cu[II]-mediated organo[60]fullerenyl cation reaction in the near future.
7. Electrochemical properties
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) is one of the most efficient methods for systematic and reliable investigation of the electrochemical properties of fullerene and its derivatives.2a Due to the intrinsic electronegativity of fullerene and its derivatives, the half reduction potential (Ered1/2) is commonly recorded to demonstrate their electron-accepting ability. Moreover, empirical computations based on the first half reduction potential (E1) afford the LUMO level (estimated using the following equation:79 LUMO level = −(4.8 + E1) eV), which is related to the photovoltaic performance. This section summarizes the CVs of all fullerene derivatives generated by fullerene cation intermediates (Table 3).

8. Photovoltaic performance
Organic fullerene derivatives are well known to be electron-accepting n-type materials; there are numerous studies on bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells using fullerene derivatives as electron acceptors.80,81 The most important index to evaluate photovoltaic performance is power conversion efficiency (PCE), which is determined by the open-circuit voltage (VOC), short-circuit current (JSC), and fill factor (FF).82 Generally, derivatization of pristine C60 can break down the 60-π system into lower systems, such as 58-π- and 56-π. Notably, smaller π-systems provide much higher LUMO levels, which increases the VOC. However, addition of many organic addends inescapably lessens the intermolecular contact, which results in decreased JSC and FF values. In addition, effective electron–hole separation should be also considered to reduce geminate recombination from the viewpoint of the morphology of the interface between the polymers and fullerenes.83 Although it is extremely difficult to answer all the questions of photovoltaics by experiments, experimentally exploring the best conditions by considering all mentioned parameters is still the most promising method to investigate fullerene-containing photovoltaics. This section summarizes the photovoltaic performance of unique fullerene acceptors provided by fullerene cation intermediate-mediated reactions based on BHJ organic solar cells. It should be mentioned that different donor materials were used to demonstrate this performance, such as poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT), poly(4,8-bis-octoxybenzo(1,2-b:4,5-b)dithiophene-2,6-diylalt-(dodecyl-thieno(3,4-b)thiophene-2-carboxylate)-2,6-diyl) (PBDTTT),84 and diketopyrrolopyrrole derivative DPP(TBFu)2 (DPP) (Table 4).85,86

9. Conclusions
Fullerene cation intermediates, namely [60]fullerene radical cation (C60˙+) and organo[60]fullerenyl cation (RC60+), have remarkably broad synthetic methodologies in fullerene chemistry. Although classical fullerene synthetic methods mainly involve fullerene radical or fullerene anion intermediates, synthetic pathways involving fullerene cations are explicitly superior in the production of unique fullerene derivatives, functional group tolerance, high selectivity, etc. This review aims to summarize the research on the development of fullerene cations, from the generation of active fullerene cations to the application of fullerene cations in reactions. In addition, fullerene cation-related fullerene derivatives used in organic solar cells were exemplified. Although the number of fullerene derivatives generated through fullerene cations is outnumbered by those obtained by other fullerene intermediate-mediated procedures, they doubtlessly demonstrate great potential for new, exciting and fruitful results in terms of fullerene cationic chemistry.
