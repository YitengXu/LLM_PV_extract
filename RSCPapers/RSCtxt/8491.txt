    , Accepted 23rd March 2020First published on 25th March 2020AbstractMicrobial electrosynthesis (MES) is a promising energy conversion technology as it can store intermittent renewable electricity while converting CO2 to value-added products using microorganisms as catalysts. However, the performance of CH4-producing MES is severely limited by the poor biofilm formation and the low loading surface area of biocathodes. Here, a novel cathode with a GO/PEDOT film was fabricated by electropolymerizing conductive poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) on graphene oxide (GO) film modified carbon cloth. The GO/PEDOT modified electrode was applied to the MES of CO2 reduction to CH4, and a maximum CH4 production rate of 315.3 ± 13.2 mmol per m2 per day (7.06 ± 0.3 l per m2 per day) (the highest rate reported up to now at −0.9 V vs. Ag/AgCl) was achieved with a Faraday efficiency > 92% at an operating potential of −0.9 V vs. Ag/AgCl, which increased 3.9-fold in contrast to the bare carbon cloth cathode. Electrochemical analysis, scanning electron microscopy, and phylogenetic analyses of microbial communities indicated that the GO/PEDOT film not only improved biofilm formation, but also increased the area for microbial colonization. This study demonstrates that GO/PEDOT film modified carbon cloth is a promising material for biocathodes of CH4-producing MES and can be beneficial to the development of MES.
1 Introduction
CO2 reduction technology with renewable energy has attracted great attention in the last decade as it can convert the accumulated CO2 to carbon-neutral products and alleviate the energy pressure brought about by fossil fuel exhaustion.1,2 Microbial electrosynthesis (MES) is an emerging renewable technology, with the function of reducing CO2 to fuels (e.g. CH4) or value-added products (e.g. acetate and ethanol) by taking advantage of autotrophic microorganisms colonizing on the cathode with assistance of a low voltage input.3 Therefore, MES is capable of converting intermittent renewable energy (e.g. solar and wind energy) into stable chemical products.4,5 Among the products, CH4 production from MES is of particular interest, as it can be easily separated from reactors and integrated with existing infrastructures.
The biocathode is the key component of MES for CO2 reduction to CH4. On a typical CH4 producing biocathode, autotrophic microorganisms (mainly methanogens) capture electrons from the cathode to produce CH4 using CO2 as the only carbon source. The electrons can be captured directly (shown as eqn (1)) by methanogens or using H2 as the reducing equivalent (shown as eqn (2) and (3)), defined as direct electron transfer (DET) and indirect electron transfer (IDET), respectively. Notably, DET biocathodes possess intrinsic advantages of high onset potential, low overpotential, and high Faraday efficiency compared to IDET biocathodes.6 CO2 + 8H+ + 8e− → CH4 + H2O, E0 = −0.244 V vs. SHE(1) 8H+ + 8e− → 4H2, E0 = −0.414 V vs. SHE(2) CO2 + 4H2 → CH4 + 2H2O(3)
Although CH4-producing MES is a promising technology, the relatively low current density and low CH4 production performance hinder its practical application. The current density of CH4-producing biocathodes is an order of magnitude lower than that of bioanodes in microbial fuel cells (MFCs), typical bioelectrochemical systems using electrochemically active microorganisms colonizing on the anode to produce electricity.7–9 It was reported that the biofilms of bioanodes had a high thickness (usually > 30 μm),10 while the CH4-producing biofilm was thin and rare (around 1 μm).6,11,12 Since the biofilm serves as the biocatalyst, the biomass content (usually reflecting on the thickness of the biofilm) has a close relationship with the performance of bioelectrodes. Therefore, the thin biofilm of biocathodes is thought to be the main reason for the poor performance, which can be attributed to the properties of electrodes and the species of microorganisms.
Increasing the biomass content is an effective approach to enhance the performance of biocathodes for CH4 production. Recently, there were some reports focused on modifying cathodes to improve the performance of CH4-producing MES. For instance, for a CH4-producing biocathode in an IDET manner, a hybrid cathode (carbon stick and graphite felt)13 and a packed bed cathode of granular carbon14 were used to improve the total microbial loading by increasing the loading surface area of electrodes. A cathode made of heat treated stainless steel15 and a cathode with a CO2 supplied structure16 were utilized to accelerate the evolution of hydrogen, which can be utilized as the reduction equivalent for methanogens. For a CH4-producing biocathode in a DET manner, a biocathode switched from a bioanode can largely shorten the total start-up time and improve the performance of biocathodes.12 Although these reports can improve the performance of biocathodes to some extent, there is no study aiming for biofilm formation enhancement and biomass improvement on carbon-based electrodes. One simple and practical approach considering these two aspects is to change the properties of cathodes by modification, which had been widely accepted in bioelectrochemical systems to alter interface properties and/or enlarge the surface area.17–22 In particular, for the MES of CO2 reduction to acetate, modifying the cathode with chitosan or other materials could achieve a maximum 6.7-fold acetate production improvement,17 suggesting that the electrode modification is a considerable way to improve the performance of CH4 producing biocathodes. In particular, since electrons are directly utilized by the microorganisms on a DET CH4-producing biocathode, improving biofilm formation through surface modification might have a more direct effect on enhancement of the performance.
Graphene is an outstanding material for electrode modification as its high conductivity and high biocompatibility can promote the formation of biofilms and electron transfer, while its high specific surface area provides a larger loading site for microorganisms.23–26 Recently, it has been reported that in acetate-producing MES for electrode fabrication, graphene oxide facilitated the biofilm formation and the electron transfer between microorganisms and the electrode and achieved a 1.5-fold acetate production improvement,27 manifesting that it is a promising material in MES application. However, the inherent π–π bond makes graphene easily aggregate, which could recede its good properties. Coupling graphene with conductive polymers can effectively reduce the aggregation of graphene and endow materials with a better electrochemical and mechanical performance.28,29 Conductive polymer poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT), of high conductivity and good biocompatibility,30,31 is thought to be an ideal material for coupling with graphene. Besides, PEDOT possesses positive charges, which can promote the adsorption of microorganisms via electrostatic attraction as most microorganisms are negatively charged.32,33 Therefore, PEDOT may have peculiar effects on acceleration of biofilm formation by microorganisms (possibly methanogens).33,34
Herein, we proposed a new method to construct a biocathode modified with a GO/PEDOT film via a simple and eco-friendly approach. The obtained GO/PEDOT film crosslinked the carbon cloth fibers, possessing a larger area for microorganism loading compared to the bare carbon cloth. The GO/PEDOT modified electrode was utilized as a CH4-producing biocathode, and the CH4 production performance was enhanced 3.9-fold compared to the bare carbon cloth electrode. Electrochemical and microscopy analysis showed that the GO/PEDOT film enhanced the formation of biofilms and the total amount of microbial loading. The microbial communities on the biocathodes were also be analyzed. This approach provides an effective way to enhance the performance of the biocathode for CH4 production in MES.
2 Methods and materials
2.1 The preparation and characterization of electrodes
A graphene oxide solution was prepared by a modified Hummers method,35 and the details are given in the ESI.† Before the modification, carbon cloth was hydrophilically treated. Carbon cloth was cut to a size of 2.5 × 4 cm2 (width × length) and then added into a mixture of nitric acid and sulfuric acid in a volume ratio of 1:3, followed with ultrasound for 3 h and soaking for 8 h. After the hydrophilic treatment, carbon cloth was washed to remove the residual acid and dried at 65 °C in air.
Four types of electrodes were used in this experiment. They are carbon cloth, a GO modified electrode (carbon cloth modified with rGO), a PEDOT modified electrode (carbon cloth modified with PEDOT) and a GO/PEDOT modified electrode (carbon cloth modified with a GO/PEDOT film). Reduction, polymerization, and electrochemical tests were applied via a three-electrode system, in which the prepared electrodes acted as the working electrode, a platinum wire electrode acted as the counter electrode, and a Ag/AgCl electrode acted as the reference electrode.
For the carbon cloth electrode, carbon cloth was used for control without further modification. For the GO modified electrode, carbon cloth was modified with GO via a dip-dry method firstly. Carbon cloth was dipped into a GO solution with a concentration of 5 mg ml−1, and the electrode was taken out and dried. The dip-dry operation was repeated twice to guarantee the loading of GO. Then, the GO modified carbon cloth was reduced at a constant current of −1 mA cm−2 for 3000 s. For the PEDOT modified electrode, 0.01 mol l−1 3, 4-ethoxylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) was added to a solution of Na2SO4 with a concentration of 0.1 mol l−1, and the mixture was stirred for 2 h at 30 °C until it was completely dissolved to make the EDOT solution. EDOT was polymerized on the carbon cloth at a constant current of 1 mA cm−2 for 3000 s. The PEDOT modified carbon cloth was washed to remove the residual substance and dried at 30 °C. For the GO/PEDOT modified electrode, the carbon cloth was first modified with a GO film though the dip-dry method. Carbon cloth after hydrophilic treatment was dipped into a GO solution with a concentration of 5 mg ml−1, and then the electrode was taken out and dried. To obtain carbon cloth covered with the GO film, the dip-dry operation was repeated twice to ensure the loading of GO. The same EDOT solution in the preparation of the PEDOT modified electrode was used here. EDOT was polymerized on carbon cloth covered with the GO film at a constant current of 1 mA cm−2 for 3000 s. Then the carbon cloth covered with the GO/PEDOT film was prepared. Finally, the GO/PEDOT modified carbon cloth was washed and dried at 30 °C. Each electrode was clamped with a folded titanium sheet in an area of 1 cm2 (the electrode area was found to be 9 cm2), and the titanium sheet was connected with titanium wire for electron transfer. The entire resistance between the electrodes and the titanium wire was less than 3 Ω.
For the electrochemical properties, the cyclic voltammetry (CV) test was performed in a 0.1 M KCl solution with 10 mM K3[Fe(CN)6] in a scan window of −0.2 to 0.6 V at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) test was performed in a 0.1 M KCl and 10 mM K3[Fe(CN)6] solution at an open-circuit potential with a frequency ranging from 100 kHz to 0.1 Hz and amplitude of 10 mV. The equivalent circuit for fitting the Nyquist plot can be found in the ESI.†
Raman spectroscopy was performed from 100 to 2500 cm−1 using a 532 nm laser with a Raman spectroscopy instrument (inVia, Renishaw, London, Britain). The surface morphology of each electrode was analyzed via scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (S-4800, HITACHI, Tokyo, Japan).
2.2 Construction of MES and operation
The dual chamber reactor used in the experiment was constituted by two single glass chambers with a 360 ml volume and a separate cation exchange membrane (9.6 cm2, UltrexCMI-7000, Membranes International Inc., Ringwood, NJ, USA). The cation exchange membranes were cleaned with deionized water in advance. Butyl rubber stoppers and aluminum seals were used for sealing.
MES was operated in a standard three-electrode system. Carbon felt (60 mm × 50 mm × 5 mm, length × width × thickness) was used as the anode, and each modified electrode was used as the cathode, and an Ag/AgCl reference electrode (R0303, Tianjin Aida hengsheng technology development co., LTD, China) was placed in the cathode chamber for controlling the potential. All the potentials in this study were referred to the Ag/AgCl electrode unless specified.
The culture source of inoculation was taken from a single-chamber microbial electrolysis cell, which was initially cultivated and domesticated from a sewage treatment plant and stably operated for more than three months in our lab. The cathode chamber was inoculated with a 130 ml anaerobic medium solution and 130 ml prepared culture medium. The anode chamber was filled with 260 ml of a medium solution. Details about the MES medium solution are given in the ESI.† The headspace of each cathode chamber was filled with CO2 (99.999% in volume). The cathode was poised at −0.7 V using a multi-channel potentiostat (VMP3, Bio-Logic, Seyssinet-Pariset, France).
2.3 Electrochemical analyses and calculations of biocathodes
CV tests of each stable biocathode were performed at a scan rate of 1 mV s−1 with a scan window of −0.4 to −0.9 V. The first derivative plots were generated to depict the relationship between the current changes and the potential applied on the biocathodes by the CV data. Once the currents of biocathodes were stabilized, the CH4 producing performance tests of each biocathode were performed by operating the biocathodes at five typical constant potentials, and monitored by calculating the amount of CH4 production as previously reported.6,11 The gas was measured using a gas chromatograph (Trace 1300, Thermo Scientific, USA) equipped with a ShinCarbon ST micropacked GC column (2 m length, Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The CH4 production performance test was conducted in triplicate. The liquid sample was measured using a gas chromatograph (Agilent 7890B, USA) equipped with a polar capillary column (Agilent DB-FFAP Column, 30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 mm). The Faraday efficiency for CH4 production at each potential was calculated according to the equation as follows:6  where nCH4 is the amount of CH4 produced in a certain time, F is the Faraday constant (F = 96485 C mol−1), and Qc is the amount of the electron transfer in this period.
2.4 Characterization of biocathodes
The characterization of microorganisms was performed via scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (S-4800, HITACHI, Tokyo, Japan). Before the SEM analysis, the biocathodes were washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) to remove the residual suspension and fixed overnight using PBS with 2.5% glutaraldehyde. Then the biocathodes were gradually dehydrated with ethanol solutions (30, 50, 70, 80, 90, and 100%), and further dehydrated with tert-butyl ethanol.36 Finally, the biocathodes were coated with gold for analysis.
The biomass content of biocathodes was extracted according to the phospholipid extraction method.37 Briefly, biocathodes with a mature biofilm were cut and washed with normal saline; then the phospholipids of the microorganisms were extracted with methyl alcohol and chloroform. The phospholipids reacted thermally with sodium persulfate, and the concentration of phosphate was further tested by using an ultraviolet visible spectrophotometer (T6 New century, Presee, Beijing, China).
2.5 Phylogenetic characterization of microorganisms on the biocathodes
The molecular phylogenetic characterization of each biocathode was performed, the DNA was extracted and used as PCR templates to construct 16S rRNA gene-amplicon libraries, and then the sequence libraries were prepared and sequenced. The experiments were performed in triplicate and all the data are expressed as mean. Sequencing data that resulted from this study were submitted to the DDBJ Sequence Read Archive (DRA009133). More details can be found in the ESI.†
3 Results and discussion
3.1 Characterization of the electrodes
As shown in Fig. 1, GO was utilized to modify the carbon cloth in the dip-dry method first to prepare the electrode.38 GO was supposed to present a straticulate and crosslinked structure between the carbon fibers38 instead of wrapping the carbon fibers39 or piling up on the carbon cloth.40 In conjunction with the GO film, PEDOT was then polymerized to form the GO/PEDOT hybrid film, and endowed the electrode with better electrochemical properties and biocompatibility.29 The SEM test was applied to confirm the morphology of the electrodes, as shown in Fig. 2A–D. Compared to the smooth and monotonous surface morphology of carbon cloth (Fig. 2A), the modified electrodes presented rougher surfaces. For the GO modified electrode (Fig. 2B), GO sheets certainly agglomerated and smashed, due to the reduction process which was essential for the conductivity and stability. The PEDOT modified electrode presented obvious particles piled up on the carbon fibers (Fig. 2C), which was due to the low surface area of the carbon fibers. In contrast, for the GO/PEDOT modified electrode, it can be observed that the GO/PEDOT film completely enveloped the surface of carbon fibers and crosslinked their middle space (Fig. 2D), and its microstructure presented overlapping and wrinkles due to the combination of GO and PEDOT. A speculative explanation for these results is that modification with PEDOT helped to ease the agglomeration and smash of GO sheets, and the GO film between the carbon fibers could avoid the agglomeration of PEDOT, thus increasing the loading surface area of the electrode. The GO/PEDOT modified electrode was suggested to be beneficial for the microbial loading on the CH4 producing biocathode.

Raman spectra analysis also confirmed the successful modification of electrodes (Fig. 2E). The sample of the carbon cloth and GO modified electrodes presented two typical peaks called the G band and D band, which were usually reflected at around 1600 and 1351 cm−1,41,42 respectively. The D peak was constituted by the ring-symmetric vibration of the sp2 atom and usually used for monitoring the degree of disorder in carbon-based materials. The G peak was formed by the expansion of the sp2 bond,43 and represented the properties of the graphitic crystalline structure. In contrast, there were several prominent peaks for the PEDOT modified electrode. The peaks at 578, 985, 1265, 1363, and 1430 cm−1 were attributed to the C–O–C deformation, oxyethylene ring deformation, thiophene C–C ring, C–C bond and CC symmetric, respectively, demonstrating the successful preparation of the PEDOT modified electrode. Most peaks of the GO/PEDOT modified electrode show a similar trend to those for the PEDOT modified electrode. The G band and D band of the GO were almost masked by the peaks of PEDOT, making the bands of GO indistinguishable from those of PEDOT. However, the band at 1600 cm−1 of the GO/PEDOT sample had a certain state of protrusion (see the orange circle in Fig. 1A), which was reported to be the interaction of PEDOT and GO,29,42 demonstrating the successful modification of GO/PEDOT on the electrode.
CV analysis was performed to evaluate the electrocatalytic performance of electrodes. As shown in Fig. 3A, the peak current of the GO/PEDOT modified electrode (the oxidation/reduction of potassium ferricyanide) was higher than that of the other three electrodes, indicating a higher electrocatalytic surface area provided by the GO/PEDOT film.33,44 EIS analysis of the four electrodes was also conducted, as shown in Fig. 3B. All the Nyquist plots presented similarly, with a semicircle in the high frequency region and a straight line in the low frequency region. The ohmic resistance (Rs) of the GO/PEDOT modified electrode was 0.93 Ω, smaller than that of the carbon cloth, PEDOT and GO modified electrode (7.02, 1.25, and 5.21 Ω, respectively), and the charge transfer resistance (Rct) of the GO/PEDOT modified electrode was 1.45 Ω, lower than that of the carbon cloth, PEDOT and GO modified electrode (4.37, 1.89, and 1.79 Ω, respectively). This demonstrated that modification with GO and PEDOT could decrease both the ohmic resistance and the charge transfer resistance of electrodes. Notably, the combination of GO and PEDOT can endow the electrode with a better electrochemical performance as expected in contrast to the sole modification with GO or PEDOT. These results suggested that the GO/PEDOT modified electrode could provide a large electroactive surface area for the colonization of microorganisms and possibly better charge transfer between microorganisms and cathode.

3.2 Electrochemical analysis of biocathodes

Fig. 4A shows the current variation of the biocathodes during the startup process. The current of all the biocathodes was negligible in the first 10 days, as methanogens formed the biofilm slowly.45 Obviously, the current of the PEDOT and GO/PEDOT modified cathode increased faster than that of the carbon cloth and GO modified electrodes during the first 40 days, which was probably attributed to the biocompatibility of PEDOT. The current of each biocathode decreased in the situation of CO2 insufficiency and recovered after CO2 replenishment (shown as arrows in Fig. 4A). It is worth mentioning that the current of CC, GO, and PEDOT modified biocathodes became relatively stable after cultivating for more than 40 days. In contrast, the current of the GO/PEDOT modified biocathode continued to increase to obtain maximum current of −2.54 A m−2, which was 3.0-fold higher than that of the unmodified biocathode (i.e., −0.84 A m−2), indicating the GO/PEDOT film was suitable for the attachment and proliferation of methanogens.

The arrows in (A) represent the sparing of CO2. The CH4 production performance valued at the volumetric rate can be found in the ESI.† 

Fig. 4B shows the CV analysis of each biocathode. All the four biocathodes presented a typical sigmoidal shape current as previously reported.12 The current of biocathodes generated at an onset potential of −0.45 V, and increased with the potential scanning range from −0.45 to −0.6 V with a midpoint potential around −0.5 V, suggesting the activation of the methanogenic biofilm. As the standard potential for the H2 evolution reaction (HER) was −0.61 V and it was reported that the onset potential of the HER on a biocathode was more negative than −0.8 V due to the overpotential;46,47 thus the current generated here was probably ascribed to the CO2 reduction to CH4 catalyzed by methanogens in a DET way (see eqn (1)).6,7,11 With the decrease of the scanning potential, the current plateaued at a potential section of −0.6 to −0.8 V, while the current presented an indistinguishable increase when the potential further decreased from −0.8 to −0.9 V, which was probably attributed to the HER. On comparing the current of the four different biocathodes, it was clear that the current of the GO/PEDOT modified cathode was much higher than that of other biocathodes, confirming that the GO/PEDOT modified electrode was suitable for CH4-producing biocathodes.
Once the current of the biocathodes was stabilized, all the biocathodes were further operated in the potential range of −0.5 to −0.9 V to measure the CH4 producing performance. As shown in Fig. 4C, the CH4 producing rate of each biocathode presented a certain correlation with the trends of current in CV curves. The GO/PEDOT modified electrode achieved the highest CH4 producing rate of 315.3 ± 13.2 mmol per m2 per day (7.06 ± 0.3 l per m2 per day) at −0.9 V, which increased 3.9-fold compared to the carbon cloth biocathode (i.e., 81.0 ± 5.1 mmol per m2 per day). The Faraday efficiency of each biocathode was around 90% (Fig. 4D), demonstrating that most of the electrons captured were utilized for CH4 production as only CH4 production was measured during the performance test. The rest of the electrons were supposed to be utilized for the biological metabolic reactions, such as proliferation, as a result of the biofilm development.6,7,11,12,16,48 The excessive performance over a wide range of potential suggested a good adaptability of the GO/PEDOT modified biocathode to integration into the existing systems.48
Generally, operating potential is an influencing factor of MES for CO2 reduction to CH4. As shown in Table 1, the biocathodes cultured at a potential more negative than the H2 generation potential (usually −0.9 V for the carbon based electrode) are likely to function in an IDET way for the involvement of H2,6 and are reported to have higher CH4 production rates compared to the DET biocathodes which are usually cultivated at a potential more positive than −0.9 V. However, the DET biocathodes are thought to be more effective than IDET biocathodes with a lower overpotential and higher Faraday efficiency. For instance, the DET biocathode developed by Cheng achieved a CH4 producing rate of 0.9 mmol per m2 per day with a Faraday efficiency of up to 90%, and the IDET biocathode developed by Liu achieved a CH4 producing rate of 44.6 mmol per m2 per day with a Faraday efficiency of 32.9%. Notably, the GO/PEDOT modified biocathode possessed the highest CH4 producing rate among previously reported biocathodes up to now at an operating potential from −0.5 to −0.9 V. Compared to the DET biocathodes developed by Fu at a culturing potential of −0.7 V, the proposed GO/PEDOT modified biocathode achieved a higher CH4 producing rate with a similar level of Faraday efficiency.11 The CH4 producing rate of the GO/PEDOT modified biocathode at −0.9 V was also higher compared with that of IDET biocathodes , and was even higher than those biocathodes functioning at a potential more negative than −0.9 V.13,15,16,49,50 This further suggested that the GO/PEDOT modified electrode was effective in enhancing the performance of CH4 producing biocathodes in MES.

3.3 Characterization of biocathodes
The hypothesis that the GO/PEDOT film could promote the methanogenic biofilm formation was verified by the morphology of biocathodes, as shown in Fig. 5. The methanogenic microorganisms on each biocathode appeared to be rod-like, and adhered with a rare extracellular polymeric substance (EPS), which was similar to previous reports.6,12 Few microorganisms were sparsely distributed on the carbon cloth biocathode (Fig. 5A and E). Compared to the carbon cloth group, the GO modified biocathode had a denser biofilm (Fig. 5B and F), likely due to the high biocompatibility of graphene. Despite the carbon cloth fibers, microorganism also loaded on the crushed reduced GO film, which contributed to the microbial loading. For the PEDOT modified biocathode (Fig. 5C and G), microorganisms piled up on the PEDOT particles with partial contact and appeared to be a denser biofilm compared to those on the carbon cloth biocathode and the GO modified biocathode. However, the interstitial space between PEDOT particles cannot meet the demands of biofilm formation, thus the low loading surface area of PEDOT particles limited the total amount of microorganisms. In contrast, the GO/PEDOT modified biocathode presented a much denser biofilm with vast microorganism loading on the GO/PEDOT film (Fig. 5D and H). Moreover, the crosslinked GO/PEDOT film structure can afford a large loading surface area for biofilm formation, which was also an assistance for the total amount of microbial loading. Therefore, the GO/PEDOT film was suggested as an ideal material to enhance the methanogenic biofilm formation, which was ascribed to the good biocompatibility and electrochemical properties of the GO/PEDOT material.34 Taking together the electrochemical analysis and the surface morphology of biofilms, the microbial loading on the four DET biocathodes was thought to be the primary factor determining the CH4 producing performance, as the electrons were utilized directly by the microorganism. The spatial GO/PEDOT film greatly enhanced the microbial loading on the biocathode and the CH4 production performance.
 Fig. 5  Surface morphology of the four biocathodes ((A and E) carbon cloth; (B and F) GO modified cathode; (C and G) PEDOT modified cathode; (D and H) GO/PEDOT modified cathode). 
To further characterize the microbial loading on the biocathodes, the biomass content of each biocathode was analyzed. As shown in Fig. 6, the GO/PEDOT modified biocathode presented a much higher biomass content of 18.7 ± 3.0 mg compared to the other biocathodes, and the biomass content was also higher than that of other CH4 producing biocathodes reported previously.12 Since bioelectrodes functioned as a platform for microorganism colonization and reaction, more microorganism loading generally indicated a better bioelectrode performance of the bioelectrochemical system.51,52 Therefore, the excellent CH4 performance of the GO/PEDOT modified biocathode could be primarily attributed to the high biomass content as indicated by the SEM analysis. It was worth noting that the biomass content of the GO/PEDOT modified biocathode increased 2.8-fold compared to that of the carbon cloth biocathode, but the performance of the CH4 producing rate increased 3.9-fold, possibly resulting from the contribution of better electron transfer between the cathode and the biofilm.

3.4 Phylogenetic analyses of microbial communities associated with the biocathodes
The phylogenetic composition of microbial communities associated with the carbon cloth, GO, PEDOT and GO/PEDOT modified biocathodes was analyzed by Illumina HiSeq 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing targeting the V3–V4 regions. Bar plots of relative abundances for major archaeal and bacterial genera (representing at least 1% of the sequences on at least one of the samples) are shown in Fig. 7. The archaeal populations of all the biocathodes were almost exclusively dominated by sequences related to methanogens of the phylum Euryarchaeota (Fig. 7A). In particular, an OTU annotated as hydrogenotrophic methanogens of the genus Methanobacterium was the most dominant species, representing at least 60% of sequences in all of the libraries. In the bacterial libraries, an unclassified genus of the class Coriobacteriia (the phylum Actinobacteria) and the genus Desulfomicrobium were the first and second most abundant genera in all of the libraries (Fig. 7B).
 Fig. 7  Microbial diversity of the CC, GO, PEDOT and GO/PEDOT modified biocathodes. Relative abundance of major taxonomic groups of Archaea (A) and Bacteria (B) at the genus level. Taxonomic assignment was performed with the RDP classifier. For groups assigned to unidentified genera, their classifications at higher taxonomic levels are also shown in parentheses. Taxa representing >1% of assignable sequences in at least one sample are shown. Taxa representing <1% of sequences in all samples are grouped in the ‘Others’ category. Experiments were performed in triplicate and data are expressed as mean. 
Thus, these results suggested that surface microbial communities of the biocathodes with different modifications were compositionally similar to each other. In previous studies, methanogens of the genus Methanobacterium have been detected as the predominant methanogens in electromethanogenic biocathodes and are likely responsible for CO2 reduction at biocathodes.6,7,12,48,53–55 Moreover, actinobacteria of the class Coriobacteriia have been detected as dominant species in many biocathodes and suggested to play key roles in catalysis of cathodic reactions.6,12,48,56,57 Thus, we speculate that these methanogens and actinobacteria cooperatively catalyze electromethanogenesis at biocathodes. Considering the higher biomass content of the GO/PEDOT modified biocathode (Fig. 6), it was concluded that the improved biocathode performance was not due to specific species grown only on the modified biocathode, but primarily attributed to the enhanced attachment/propagation of the catalytic microorganisms on the crosslinking GO/PEDOT film, further suggesting the excellent biocompatibility of GO/PEDOT with electrocatalytic microorganisms.
4 Conclusion
Herein, we report a novel GO/PEDOT modified electrode with high performance in the microbial electrosynthesis system for CO2 reduction to CH4. The GO/PEDOT modified biocathode achieved a maximum current density of −2.54 A m−2 during the startup process, and achieved the highest CH4 producing rate of 315.3 mmol per m2 per day with a Faraday efficiency of up to 92% at −0.9 V vs. Ag/AgCl, which increased 3.9-fold in contrast to the carbon cloth biocathode. These results were probably attributed to the high biomass content caused by the dense biofilm and large loading surface area of the GO/PEDOT film. Thus, the GO/PEDOT modified electrode showed great potential for the development of MES.
