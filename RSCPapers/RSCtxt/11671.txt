    , Accepted 16th December 2015First published on 22nd December 2015AbstractThe device efficiency of bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells is critically dependent on the nano-morphology of the solution-processed polymer:fullerene blend. Active control on blend morphology can only emanate from a detailed understanding of solution structures during the film casting process. Here we use photoinduced charge transfer (CT) rates to probe the effective length scale of the pre-formed solution structures and their energy disorder arising from a mixture of poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT) and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) in three different organic solvents. The observed solvent-dependent ultrafast biphasic rise of the transient polaron state in solution along with changes detected in the CC stretching frequency of bound PCBM provides direct evidence for film-like P3HT:PCBM interfaces in solution. Using the diffusive component of the charge transfer rate, we deduce ∼3-times larger functional nano-domain size in toluene than in chlorobenzene thereby correctly predicting the relative polymer nanofiber widths observed in annealed films. We thus provide first experimental evidence for the postulated polymer:fullerene:solvent ternary phase that seeds the eventual morphology in spin-cast films. Our work motivates the design of new chemical additives to tune the grain size of the evolving polymer:fullerene domains within the solution phase.
Introduction
Organic photovoltaics (OPVs) being economically viable, light weight and mechanically flexible can potentially offer a long-term solution to the energy problem. Solution processable bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells have shown considerable promise due to the ease of fabrication.1 In these devices, usually a solution of an electron donor (D) polymer and an acceptor (A) fullerene is spin cast onto the bottom electrode followed by solvent evaporation, which results in the formation of an active layer for photo-current generation. The interpenetrating pure polymer and fullerene nano-domains form the basis for good conductivity in these organic devices. Upon absorption of light by the polymer domain, strongly bound Frenkel excitons form, which can diffuse to the D:A interface to generate weakly bound charge transfer (CT) excitons. The CT excitons then dissociate to form electron and hole polarons which move to their respective electrodes to generate the photo-current. Best power conversion efficiency to date for such polymer:fullerene blends has reached 9.2% for single and 10.6% for tandem-cell devices.2,3 However, one of the major issues concerning both the efficiency and device robustness in any BHJ solar cell is the reproducibility of domain size and chemical control over the desired morphology.4,5 In fact, efficient exciton diffusion and dissociation critically depends on the nanoscopic structure of the domains.4,6–12 Previous work has also provided evidence that the device efficiency is strongly dependent on the choice of precursor organic solvent and solvent additives used for film casting.13–19 It has been conjectured that the memory of polymer conformations in solution is retained in the cast neat polymer films.14,20 Therefore, an in-depth molecular-level understanding of polymer:fullerene interactions in solution, which dictate the incumbent film structure, will be important for attaining synthetic control over the active layer morphology.
To address this important issue, it is necessary to structurally track or dynamically image the evolution of the polymer:fullerene nano-morphology during the film casting process. Although there have been several attempts to understand the nano-morphologies of the active layer in BHJs using transmission electron microscopy (TEM),21–25 atomic force microscopy (AFM),13,21 confocal lifetime imaging,14,26 electron tomography,27,28 and C60 slicing,29 only a few reports have been able to dynamically track the structure in all length scales and relevant timescales. Grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXD)30 and coarse-grained molecular simulation studies31 have provided a selective glimpse into the process while highlighting the importance of understanding the solution structure evolution during spin casting. Recently, Janssen and co-workers have provided a rigorous thermodynamic insight into the solvent evaporation phenomena during film casting by proposing three distinct phases of film formation.32 They postulated an intermediate phase which arises due to the liquid–liquid de-mixing step at high local concentrations of polymers and fullerenes which subsequently dictates the final film morphology. To test the above formulated hypothesis, spectroscopic signatures of the polymer:fullerene intermediate phase in solution are imperative.
Photoinduced CT rates being sensitive to the donor–acceptor distance can be used as an effective tool to measure the intrinsic length scale of these nanoscopic phases. Detailed analysis of the CT kinetics in solvent annealed films has provided timescales and mechanistic insights into the pathways of exciton dissociation.33–38 It has been established that two distinct processes define charge generation at the polymer:fullerene interface. An ultrafast component of <100 fs characterizes the extent of exciton delocalization while a long picosecond component signifies the exciton diffusion timescale.34,35,38 The biphasic rise in the population of polarons therefore becomes the basis for defining the morphology of the spin-cast films. We envision that solution structures and their functional relevance can be traced by capturing the D:A photoinduced CT rates. To demonstrate this concept, here we chose a poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT) (Mn = 54–75 kDa, regio-regular) conjugated polymer and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) as the D:A pair.39,40Fig. 1 shows a cartoon representation of the hypothesized polymer:fullerene soluble nano-aggregates that depicts the interaction of the polymer nano-domains with PCBM aggregates and solvent molecules. Stimulated Raman scattering of only P3HT aggregates in different solvents show pronounced solvent dependence to energy disorder and these aggregates upon PCBM addition showed the presence of distinct polymer:fullerene interfaces. Using broadband femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy in conjunction with steady-state and time-resolved emission measurements, we report a biphasic rise of the polaron feature in P3HT:PCBM solution. Based on this observation and the experimentally measured exciton diffusion coefficient, we derived a domain size correlation which unraveled that the P3HT:PCBM nano-aggregate in toluene has ∼3 times larger functional domain size as compared to that in chlorobenzene. Our results thus provide the first experimental evidence to support the model proposed by Janssen and co-workers that the nano-fiber width of solvent-dried polymer:PCBM films could be correlated to the solubility of the polymer in its spin-casting solvent.41

Results and discussion
Since the choice of precursor solvent affects the self-organization and phase separation of polymer:fullerene domains in blend films,23,41 the correlation of P3HT:PCBM solution nanostructures to the film morphology was investigated by choosing three different solvents. The solvents that were chosen in this study provided an opportunity to systematically study the interaction of the solvent with P3HT and PCBM in determining the solution structures. Good solvents like chlorobenzene (CLB) and chloroform (CHCl3) can make the P3HT and PCBM molecules more soluble than bad solvents like toluene (TL).13,21,23,42 It has been reported previously that solution processed P3HT:PCBM devices follow the efficiency order as CLB > TL > CHCl3.13 Since we ought to reach a film-like morphology, P3HT solutions were prepared with high concentrations at 0.25 mg ml−1 in all solvents while maintaining a 1:20 w/w ratio of P3HT:PCBM mixtures. High PCBM concentrations were chosen to achieve a large population of spectroscopically accessible polymer:fullerene interfaces. These solutions were characterized by a combination of optical spectroscopies as well as dynamic light scattering (DLS) for the estimation of particle sizes, and with TEM imaging to gain insight into the solvent dried film morphology at this polymer and fullerene concentration.
Steady-state absorption and light scattering measurement of P3HT:PCBM in solution

Fig. 2a shows the comparison of the steady-state absorption spectra of a P3HT:PCBM (1:20) mixture with the pristine polymer and free PCBM in TL. The characteristic π–π* transition of P3HT in TL shows the maximum at 454 nm while the additional absorption band in the red edge shows vibronic features at 516, 566 and 614 nm respectively that arise due to the formation of ordered polymer aggregates.43–46 These vibronic features are separated by 1380 cm−1 which corresponds to delocalized CC ring stretches.47 Addition of PCBM into these solutions broadens the absorption features in the red-edge due to the emergence of a new optical feature for self-associated fullerenes as seen in the pure fullerene spectrum. The aggregation propensity of polymers and fullerenes is directly assessed by measuring the equivalent hydrodynamic radii of P3HT chains and their aggregates using a DLS experiment. In Fig. 2a, the inset shows the size dependence of P3HT:PCBM complexes in three different solvents with 1:0 and 1:20 w/w ratios. Free P3HT in TL shows big aggregates with ∼180 nm average particle size compared to ∼40 nm in CLB and ∼70 nm in CHCl3. This aggregate formation signifies the presence of pre-formed solution structures in different solvents. Addition of PCBM (whose DLS shows <1 nm hydrodynamic radius; see ESI Fig. S3†) into these polymer solutions makes the aggregates swell to slightly bigger sizes (10–20% increase) possibly indicating solubilization of PCBM inside the polymer aggregates. We carried out TEM measurements on solvent dried films of pristine P3HT which show that TL and CLB aid the formation of nano-fibers while unstructured and loose aggregates form after CHCl3 evaporation (see ESI Fig. S20†). For the dried films of P3HT:PCBM (1:20) in toluene (see ESI Fig. S21†), we observe contacts between the polymer nano-fiber and the fullerene aggregates.

Stimulated Raman spectroscopy of P3HT:PCBM in solution
To characterize the polymer nano-aggregates in different solvents, we measured the stimulated Raman spectra (SRS) of pristine P3HT and P3HT:PCBM mixtures. Fig. 2b shows the Raman vibrational features near the CC stretching region of pristine P3HT in TL, CLB and CHCl3. A broad peak is observed in all the three solvents with the peak position most blue shifted in CHCl3 at 1473 cm−1 while it is red-shifted by 29 cm−1 in TL. The bathochromic shift observed in both the steady-state absorption spectra and the CC stretch vibration in the SRS spectra of P3HT is a clear indication that the effective conjugation length has increased due to ordering of the aggregates through inter-chain π–π stacking. In conjunction with the previous work carried out by Kim and co-workers, the current data indicate that P3HT has the greatest propensity to form ordered nano-fibers in TL.48 Therefore, our work suggests that the polymer–solvent interaction rather than the polymer–polymer interaction plays a crucial role in determining the structure of these pre-formed soluble nano-aggregates.
We probed the polymer:fullerene interfaces in solution by comparing the vibrational spectrum of the Ag symmetric CC stretching mode of PCBM in free and bound forms.49 The stimulated Raman spectrum of the P3HT:PCBM mixture compared to that observed for pristine P3HT and free PCBM in toluene is presented in Fig. 3a and b respectively. The P3HT feature does not show any change in the peak position upon complexation possibly due to the broad intrinsic line widths of the CC feature. However, the presence of a shoulder at 1467 cm−1 on the blue-edge of the main P3HT in the mixture arises from the symmetric CC stretching mode of the PCBM moiety (see the arrow in Fig. 3a). The difference Raman spectrum which removes the P3HT contribution is shown in Fig. 3b, reveals the peak shape of the CC stretch for the PCBM species in the P3HT:PCBM mixture. The 2 cm−1 blue shift in the peak frequency from the free PCBM value along with its spectral broadening (ΔνFWHM > 4–5 cm−1) in the mixture (Fig. 3b) is evidence for heterogeneous polymer:fullerene molecular interfaces. The interfacing of the polymer thiophene ring with the PCBM molecule ensures localization of the Ag symmetric CC stretching mode through symmetry breaking interactions, leading to a slight blue-shift in the stretch frequency. The broadening of the peak arises due to spectral convolution of the Raman spectra from both the free and bound forms of PCBM present in the mixture. An alternate explanation which includes enhanced PCBM aggregation in the presence of P3HT leading to a shift in the frequency of the CC stretching mode can be excluded as we did not observe any apparent changes in the Raman bands upon increasing the solution PCBM concentrations by 3–4 times (see ESI Fig. S22†). Our interpretation therefore of the Raman spectral change is not affected by the plausible self-aggregation propensities of PCBM molecules observed at very high concentrations. Similar fullerene inclusions with blue-shifted CC stretching mode in dried films have been detected by Raman spectroscopy of P3HT:PCBM blends recently by Falke and co-workers.49 Therefore, the Raman data suggest that polymer:fullerene molecular interfaces do also exist in solution as in the dried films.

The arrow shows the shoulder arising due to the CC stretch from the PCBM molecules in the mixture; (b) comparison of the CC stretching frequency of equimolar free PCBM in toluene and the bound PCBM in the toluene dissolved P3HT:PCBM mixture. 
Steady state (Fig. S5†) and time-resolved fluorescence measurements (Fig. S6†) also support the formation of polymer:fullerene interfaces within the aggregates leading to a dominant static quenching mechanism. Steady-state fluorescence of P3HT (λex = 490 nm) is quenched upon addition of an increasing concentration of PCBM (0–20 wt%) in all the three solvents. Fluorescence lifetime measurements with excitation λex = 458 nm using a time correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) method shows modest dynamic quenching of the P3HT lifetime in the presence of PCBM. Therefore, the lifetime quenching of 1.5 times upon PCBM addition is inconsistent with emission quenching measured via steady state fluorescence upon PCBM titration. In addition, TCSPC measurements also show the smaller lifetime of P3HT in TL as compared to CLB. These observations indicate that the dynamic change in the mean exciton lifetime possibly originates from alterations in the polymer:polymer inter-chain interactions.50 The solvent dependence arises from energy disorder present in the solution while the PCBM addition leads to possible restructuring of the polymer domains. We thus presume that both static quenching via increased P3HT:PCBM interfaces and dynamic lifetime quenching by altered intra-strand energy transfer pathways in P3HT:PCBM mixtures are operative. It should be noted that steady-state measurements alone may not always be confirmatory since secondary absorption effects at high weight percentage of PCBM will contribute to pronounced emission quenching. However, the combination of stimulated Raman spectroscopy along with emission quenching imply that donor–acceptor complexes are indeed formed in solution indicating the existence of polymer:fullerene interfaces. Stimulated Raman, DLS and lifetime measurements however could not provide any information on the length scales of the pure polymer phase within the large nano-aggregates.
Femtosecond transient absorption measurements of P3HT:PCBM in solution
In order to provide the functional size of D:A domains within the soluble nano-aggregates, we measured the photoinduced CT rates using broadband near-IR femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy. Using a 475 nm femtosecond excitation pulse resonant with the P3HT absorption, transient absorption spectra were recorded with an IRF of ∼90 fs at various pump–probe delays in the NIR region from 825 to 1300 nm. Fig. 4a shows the transient absorption spectrum at 10 ps subsequent to pump excitation obtained for P3HT and P3HT:PCBM mixtures in TL recorded under an argon atmosphere. Pristine P3HT in TL shows broad excited state absorption (ESA) at around 1070 nm assigned as a singlet exciton.51 Transient absorption of the P3HT:PCBM mixture (1:20 w/w) in TL shows a broader ESA spectrum towards the blue edge. The new feature on the blue edge in the mixture corresponds to the hole polaron feature as reported previously in P3HT:PCBM films as well as in nanoparticles.36,52 The polaronic feature was observed in all the three solvents for the P3HT:PCBM (1:20 w/w) mixture.

(b) The TA difference spectrum ΔΔA (blue) between the P3HT:20PCBM mixture and pristine P3HT matches well with the differential steady state absorption spectrum of chemically oxidized P3HT (black) obtained from FeCl3 oxidation of P3HT. The extra feature at 1030 nm is assigned to the anion radical of PCBM. 
To illustrate the specific spectral changes, we plotted the difference transient absorption spectrum (ΔΔA) at 10 ps after a careful subtraction procedure as explained in the ESI (Fig. S11–S13†). The ΔΔA spectrum shows a broad feature extending from 830 nm to 1060 nm which matches well with the steady-state absorption spectrum of the chemically oxidized polymer obtained through the differential change in P3HT absorption after FeCl3 oxidation (see Fig. S7 in the ESI†). The additional feature at around 1030 nm marked in Fig. 4b, arises from the formation of the transient PCBM anion radical assigned, based on the previously reported reduced PCBM spectra.53–55 Previously, Tak Kee and co-workers had shown the hole polaron spectra of P3HT in the aqueous suspension of P3HT–PCBM nanoparticle aggregates.52 However they did not observe any evidence for the formation a PCBM anion radical. We believe that our observation of simultaneous photo-generation of both the P3HT hole polaron and the anion radical of PCBM is the first of its kind, especially in solution.
It is important to mention here that pristine P3HT solution does not show any polaron population upon photoexcitation under identical experimental conditions. This has been confirmed by carrying out transient absorption measurements at different concentrations and pump power for the pristine polymer (ESI Fig. S14†). The normalized TA spectra of neat polymers at different concentrations show a similar exciton feature; no additional band due to polarons is observed at a high concentration. The insensitivity of the spectral shape to dilution and negligible power dependence shows that polaron pairs are not being generated under similar conditions. In addition, photo-exciting the free PCBM at 475 nm shows completely different transient spectra with a small signal intensity (10% of ΔΔA signal) which does not decay up to few nanoseconds (see Fig. S16†). This spectrum does not match the anion radical spectrum at ∼1030 nm that is observed in the transient spectra of the mixture. Therefore, we can rule out the effects on the transient spectra in the mixture from PCBM only photo-excitation. Thus the charge transfer process triggered by the 475 nm pulse is primarily due to electron transfer from photoexcited P3HT to PCBM.
Plotting the temporal dependence of the ΔΔA spectra can be used to track the rise of the polaron species in different solvents. The ΔΔA spectra for the P3HT:PCBM mixture in TL at different time intervals are shown in Fig. 5a. Within the first picosecond we observe the ultrafast rise of a P3HT polaron feature at around 850 nm contrasted with the slower rise of the PCBM anion radical at 1030 nm. The P3HT:PCBM mixture in CHCl3 and CLB also shows similar types of evolutions of polaronic bands (Fig. S17†). Fig. 5b shows the kinetics of the as observed ΔΔA amplitude at 900 nm as a function of the pump–probe delay times. The population dynamics of the polaron was fitted using a multi-exponential model data convoluted with the experimental IRF. In all the three solvents, we observed a bi-exponential rise of the polaron state followed by a slow decay component similar to the mechanism observed in polymer:PCBM films.34–36,38 Although the slowest decay component (∼100 ps) can provide information on the loss of the polaron population, the overlapping P3HT triplet state absorption (Fig. S19a†) makes the interpretation difficult. It should be noted however that the rise time for the triplet state is ∼480 ps (Fig. S19b†), much slower than the polaron generation timescales. We therefore focus exclusively on the analysis of the biphasic rise time in the present work. The faster component (Fig. 5b inset) of the bi-exponential rise ranges within ∼400–700 fs in all the solvents, albeit slower than the ∼10–100 fs dissociation of the delocalized exciton at the interface observed in solvent annealed polymer:PCBM blends.34,35,38 The timescale of the rise of polarons in various solvents as presented in Fig. 6a indicates that TL facilitates an efficient charge transfer (∼400 fs) at the P3HT:PCBM interface where the rate is ∼1.75 times faster than that in either CLB or CHCl3. We still find the sub-picosecond CT timescale surprisingly fast since solvent reorganization that mediates Marcus-type electron transfer in homogeneous solutions usually occurs in few picoseconds.56,57 The timescales obtained here indicate the presence of strongly coupled pairs separated by few intervening solvent molecules possibly precursors to the solvent-free D:A interfaces in blends. Such solvent coupled donor and acceptor pairs can possibly arise due to close packing of polymer:fullerene domains in soluble P3HT:PCBM nano-aggregates.

Fig. 6a illustrates the strong solvent dependence of the slower component of the photoinduced CT reaction. We interpret the differential change in the timescale by invoking the diffusive component to the CT process, an effective kinetic model used to describe the photo-induced events operating in spin-cast P3HT:PCBM films.34,35,38 We find that the diffusive component ranges from ∼5 ps in CLB being the fastest to ∼18 ps in TL. The assignment of the slower timescale to the diffusive component is supported by the lack of any correlation of the electron transfer timescale to the trend of the measured solvent re-orientation timescales of CHCl3, TL and CLB.58,59 In fact the ∼3.6 times longer diffusive CT component in TL compared to CLB augurs well with the observation in dried films for TEM that TL leads to larger polymer domain widths while CLB shows much finer polymer domain sizes.13,22–24,31 However, the ratios provide only a qualitative guide to domain sizes in solution since the size ratio for the functional domains in P3HT:PCBM may depend on how the PCBM molecules are attached along the fibers. Moreover, the relative amplitude of the ultrafast and slow diffusive components in each solvent describes the effectiveness of polymer:PCBM packing in solution (Fig. 6b). In the case of TL, the ultrafast and diffusive components contribute almost equally to the rise of polaron population indicating solvent buried interfaces with the large polymer nano-domains. However, in CLB, the pure P3HT domain size is relatively small with loose packing due to substantial contribution from favorable solvent-mediated ternary interactions. The analysis presented above is ably supported by the recent coarse grain simulations of P3HT:PCBM solvent evaporation carried out by Lee et al. in bromobenzene which predict a finer domain size and well mixed polymer:fullerene morphology.31 The rates in CHCl3 also show similar behavior as CLB although the diffusive component has a ∼2.5 times slower rate indicating a larger polymer domain width. Our result thus confirms the universality of the bi-exponential rise in the solution state, and establishes the solvent control on the eventual nano-morphology of the solvent-dried P3HT:PCBM films.
Effective domain size calculation
The effective domain size can be defined as the average distance the exciton travels in the polymer domain before it reaches the polymer:fullerene interface to generate charges. The experimentally determined diffusive component for the CT reaction can be used to provide a nanometric size estimate of the pure polymer phase if we know the exciton diffusion coefficients (D) of P3HT in different solvents. Our method of course relies on the lifetime of excitons, which should be sufficiently longer than the timescale of polaron generation in solution before its eventual decay through non-radiative pathways. The power dependence of the exciton decay obtained from transient absorption studies (see ESI Fig. S4†) was used to construct the time-dependent exciton–exciton annihilation rate (γ) which can be used to determine the value of D as described in the ESI pages S7–S10.† The exciton concentration (n) during the annihilation process can be described by the rate equation: (1)where k is the exciton decay rate in the absence of annihilation and γ is the annihilation rate.60 The annihilation rate in terms of diffusion coefficient (D) can be given as (2)where r is the exciton annihilation radius. Fitting the annihilation rate kinetics can give an estimate of time-independent exciton diffusion coefficient, D. Since the solvent dependent energy disorder in the polymer nano-aggregates would affect the diffusion coefficient, we carried out annihilation measurements of P3HT in all the three solvents. Fig. 7a shows the time-dependence of the annihilation rate in TL, CLB and CHCl3. In the case of TL, the annihilation rate drops down by an order of magnitude within the first picosecond while the decrease is much more moderate in the other two solvents. Due to ultrafast exciton localization and solvent controlled heterogeneity in nano-domains, we could not model the fast change using standard diffusion models. Instead, the data at longer timescales in between 5 and 20 ps, a range that corresponds to the slower component of charge generation in P3HT:PCBM mixtures, were fitted using eqn (2). The fits obtained provided a reasonable estimate of the time-independent D with different ranges of r within 1.2–1.4 nm. For CLB and CHCl3 the values obtained for D were ∼1.3 × 10−4 cm2 s−1 and ∼2.6 × 10−4 cm2 s−1 respectively while in the case of TL the poorer fit resulted in the dispersion of fitted D values between 3 × 10−4 cm2 s−1 and 5 × 10−4 cm2 s−1. In order to discriminate, we chose r = 1.3 nm similar to that obtained in CLB, and arrived at the best fit of 3.3 × 10−4 cm2 s−1. It should be noted that all the values for D under solution conditions were found to be one order of magnitude lower than that in solvent-cast P3HT films.34,61 With this estimated diffusion coefficient, we calculated the exciton diffusion length (L) at time t using the equation  assuming a 2D-diffusion model,34 and thus the effective domain size (2L) can be ascertained.

Inset: fitting of the annihilation rate after few picoseconds using the time-dependent annihilation rate eqn (2); (b) effective domain size of soluble nano-aggregates in different solvents as estimated based on the slow diffusive component. 
Using the obtained values of CT rates and diffusion coefficients, the effective domain size of the formed P3HT aggregates in TL is ∼2.2 nm, while that in CLB and CHCl3 are ∼0.72 nm and ∼1.56 nm, respectively as shown in Fig. 7b. We find that the relative ratios of the domain sizes in the solution phase are comparable to the relative domain widths obtained in solvent evaporated films. The TEM images of the P3HT film that was cast from exactly the same concentrations show smaller and thinner nano-fibers cast from CLB as compared to that from TL (see ESI Fig. S20†). The relative domain widths of the nano-fibers are in the ratio of 1:1.5:2.2 for P3HT in CLB, CHCl3 and TL, respectively. Recently, Rene Janssen and co-workers have shown that the width of polymer nano-fiber is directly correlated to the solubility of the polymer in the co-solvent, thereby supporting our assignment that the domain sizes of soluble nano-aggregates ultimately dictate the nano-fiber widths in dried films.41
Although we do not directly estimate the exciton delocalization lengths in solution, we see an increasing contribution of the ultrafast component upon increasing the domain size which is contrary to that predicted in films by Whaley and Nitzan.62 This apparent disagreement can be reconciled by invoking the smaller exciton delocalization length of the P3HT:PCBM in CLB than that in TL due to increased disorder in polymer chains in CLB through pronounced interfacial solvation i.e. less binding interfaces in CLB. The solvent-dependent exciton delocalization length primarily arises from the energy disorder present in the polymer domains as observed from the variation of the CC stretching frequency (Fig. 2b) in different solvents. In fact this is manifested unequivocally in TL where we observe a structured absorption and emission spectra along with the red-shifted CC Raman frequency indicating chain ordering within aggregates (Fig. S1–S3†). In addition, due to more order of the P3HT domains in TL we find a shorter exciton lifetime (a bad solvent for P3HT) (Fig. S6†) due to stronger inter-chain coupling leading to faster energy transfer rates compared to that in CLB.44,45,50 Our determined length scale therefore probes the emergence of interpenetrating phases of pure polymers and PCBM in solution, and that the size and order/disorder of the individual polymer domains is controlled via the energetics of the ternary interactions.
As determined through our DLS measurements, the average size of the nano-aggregates for free P3HT in solution only changes by 20% upon PCBM addition. This moderate change in the overall size of the nano-aggregates (∼100–200 nm) either indicates solubilization of added PCBM to loosely packed free polymer phases or creation of multiple polymer:fullerene interfaces along the short axis of the nano-aggregates. Therefore, our determined effective domain size captures the formation of functional seed interfaces which would dictate the final active film morphology which is also supported by the recent work by Janssen and co-workers.41 Although thermal annealing and drying time may change the film morphology, here we stress the significance of the interfacial structure that forms the starting point of morphology control for the solvent cast films. It is important to recollect that device efficiency does have a correlation to the choice of solvent used.13 Detailed understanding of the annealing thermodynamics will be critical to address the pertinent issue of how the seed memory affects the final device efficiency.
Significantly the differential trend observed for the functional domain sizes in the above three solvents match well with the relative domain widths of such nano-domains in dried polymer films obtained through our TEM measurements (ESI Fig. S20†) as well as through the reported AFM and electron microscopy.13,22–24 In addition, the Raman measurement (Fig. 2b) for the CC stretch of P3HT shows a higher degree of the order structure in TL that can be interpreted as the presence of a long nano-fiber as compared to that in CLB while P3HT in CHCl3 forms disordered/loosely packed aggregates as evidenced from the TEM. In fact it has been observed by Sum and co-workers that the charge generation and recombination dynamics in P3HT:PCBM films is highly affected by the nano-fiber length thereby affecting the device efficiency.37 The correlation of the domain sizes and length of the nano-fiber in solution to that in spin-cast films as well as the corresponding device efficiencies13 enunciates the significance of understanding the solution structures in order to gain synthetic control on the film nano-morphology. Therefore, for better performance of devices it is essential to optimize both the domain length and width. The coarse-grain simulations carried out by Lee et al. provide a dynamical description of the growth of the functional nano-domains and support our principal conclusions.31 Our measurements thus provide the first experimental evidence for a polymer:fullerene:solvent ternary interaction that controls the size-evolution during the drying process to yield the photoactive films. It is an important step towards understanding the nature of the liquid:liquid demixing transition previously postulated within the thermodynamic framework of the polymer:fullerene drying process.32 Detailed computational efforts are required to understand the nature of the solvent-controlled ternary interfaces, and will provide key insights into the effect of trapped solvents on the microscopic rates of charge generation. We believe that using the structural details of this intermediate ternary phase, solvent additives can be designed to inhibit and tune the grain size by doping in “mutant” polymers. Such a procedure can be implemented at the molecular level with precise knowledge of complementary interactions.
Conclusions
In conclusion, we report ultrafast photoinduced charge generation in soluble P3HT:PCBM nano-aggregates for the first time, and present a solvent-dependent correlation to the length scales of the preformed functional polymer:fullerene domains in solution. We show that the nano-aggregates of P3HT:PCBM in toluene have larger functional domain widths than that in solvents like chlorobenzene or chloroform, explaining the relative widths of the nanofibers as obtained from TEM of P3HT in films cast from these three solvents. Stimulated Raman scattering of P3HT:PCBM in TL shows the presence of polymer:fullerene interfaces in solution, and also indicates the presence of ordered polymer aggregates arising from the longer nanofibers as compared to that in CLB, while P3HT in CHCl3 forms disordered/loosely packed aggregates which is also supported by the TEM measurements. The preformed soluble nanostructures of the ternary polymer:fullerene:solvent phase seeds the eventual film morphology, and thereby dictates the resulting device efficiency via the subtle morphology-dependent interplay of charge generation and recombination processes in the active layer. Our work implies that tailoring the solution conditions using chemical additives should enable optimized D:A morphologies through solvent mediated self-assembly. The methodology to use charge generation rates for domain size estimation in the solution state is an attractive alternative to conventional electron microscopy, and can provide new insights into all the solution-processed solar cells including the new perovskite-based devices.
