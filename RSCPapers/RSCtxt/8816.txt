    , Accepted 5th July 2021First published on 15th July 2021AbstractTwo-dimensional (quasi-2D) perovskites have attracted tremendous attention due to their excellent environmental stability and various optoelectronic properties. However, their high crystallization capability as a critical advantage for paving the way toward practical applications of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is always ignored. The work presented in this paper focuses on blade-coating processing with non-thermal assistance to fabricate high-efficiency quasi-2D PSCs. Based on BA2MA3Pb4I13 (n = 4) perovskite (BA: butylamine; MA: methylamine), we successfully achieved high-quality quasi-2D perovskite films with lower defects by using the blade-coating method. Note that this is the first attempt to manufacture a blade-coated quasi-2D perovskite layer for PSCs. Compared to 3D perovskite, non-thermal assistance is allowed during the formation of crystalline 2D perovskite, which dramatically enlarges the reproducibility of high-performance PSCs. Finally, an enhanced photovoltage performance with a PCE of 15.47% was obtained, which is one of the highest efficiencies in BA2MA3Pb4I13 PSCs (n = 4). The enhanced charge extraction induced by limiting interfacial charge accumulation and resultant carrier loss via recombination is carefully illustrated, confirming the high quality of the blade-coated quasi-2D perovskite film. Our work involving studies of blade-coated quasi-2D perovskites proved to be encouraging, to realize large-area manufacturing in commercial PSCs.
Introduction
As a legendary material over the past decade, organic–inorganic halide perovskite is widely used in solar cells, photodetectors, and LEDs,1–8 due to its inherent advantages, including high absorption coefficient, tuneable bandgap, easy processing, and low cost. In particular, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has skyrocketed from the initial 3% to 25.2%.9–12 Meanwhile, the formation progress of perovskite films acting as photo-active layers plays a crucial role in fabricating PSCs, which drastically impacts the quality of crystallinity.13–15 To date, the spin-coating process is most commonly used for preparing high-quality perovskite films with low densities of defects and pinholes.16–18 However, given the features of the low utilization of the precursor solution, poor reproducibility, and small area processing, the spin-coating method can only be used in the lab for scientific research, which has retarded the way PSCs can be further developed for commercial application. Significant efforts have been devoted to developing cost-effective and scalable fabrication methods, including blade coating, drop coating, thermal evaporation, and spray printing.19–23 Among these, blade coating is one of the most promising commercial techniques because it is an easy way to realize the large-scale formation of perovskite films with minimal material waste, which can be readily transferred to slot-die coating for sheet-to-sheet or roll-to-roll volume manufacturing.24–28
With an advantage over the spin-coating method, intensive studies involving blade-coating have been reported recently. Jen and his co-workers firstly investigated the feasibility of achieving fully printable 3D PSCs by the blade-coating technique under ambient conditions. Finally, a PCE of 10.44% was achieved after optimizing the blade-coating process and relative humidity in the environment.29 In addition, Huang et al. reported vividly colorful 3D PSCs attributed to a combination of a hundred-micrometer size large domain structure and a concentric ring photonics structure in each domain, which was fabricated by a low-cost and scalable doctor-blade coating method. As a result, the resulting device yielded an improved PCE of 15.1%.30 Later, they introduced bilateral alkylamine (BAA) additives, then achieved blade-coated PSCs with a record PCE of 21.5%. However, owing to the poor capability of crystallization of 3D perovskites, thermal assistance is a critical requirement during the process of film formation, which contributes to high-quality crystallinity under the blade-coating process. So, the poor capability of crystallization and controllable annealing are still a hindrance for high-performance PSCs with high reproducibility.
Recently, two-dimensional (quasi-2D) perovskites have emerged as promising candidates for next-generation PSCs due to their long-term stability, easy crystallinity, and component diversity, which pave the way for the feasibility of achieving high-quality film by using the blade-coating process.17,31–33 For example, through caesium based elemental doping, Liu et al. reported BA2MA3Pb4I13 (n = 4) PSCs with a PCE exceeding 13%.34 Recently, Mohite et al. demonstrated a scalable approach involving the dissolution of single-phase crystalline powders with a homogeneous perovskite layer thickness in desired solvents to fabricate 2D perovskite thin-films with high phase purity (BA2MA3Pb4I13). Photovoltaic devices fabricated with such films yield an efficiency of 17.1% and a 1.20 V open-circuit voltage.35 It is worth noting that the characteristic of ease of crystallization makes it possible to achieve a fine perovskite film by blade coating without thermal assistance, which reduces uncontrollable factors, thereby significantly improving the reproducibility of high-performance PSCs. In addition, the excellent long-term stability of quasi-2D perovskites allows the blade-coating process to be operated outside a glove box, which is urgently needed for large-scale production. Unfortunately, only a few studies have focused on blade coating quasi-2D PSCs. Apart from spin coating, only the drop-cast method is reported for depositing precursor solutions that self-assemble into highly oriented, uniform quasi-2D-perovskite films in air, yielding perovskite solar cells with power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of up to 14.9%.36
Herein, we report the first quasi-2D PSCs (based on BA2MA3Pb4I13) using blade coating without thermal assistance in an ambient atmosphere and investigate the properties of BA2MA3Pb4I13 blade-coated films. Intense investigations with XRD (X-ray diffractometry) and UV absorption spectroscopy for spin-coated films and blade-coated films showed that blade coating benefits the crystal growth of quasi-2D perovskites. By combining scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscope (AFM) analysis to test the surface of the perovskite film, we found that the blade-coated film maintained a flatter surface with a larger grain size compared to the spin-coated film. Furthermore, low densities of pinholes and cracks occurred on the surface of the blade-coated film due to the slow crystallization of the precursor solution. PL results revealed that fine gradients in the vertical distribution of multiple perovskite phases (from the quasi-2D phase, n = 1 at the bottom to quasi-3D phase, n = ∞ near the top region) are also obtained with blade coating, leading to favorable alignment of the bandgap energy in the quasi-2D perovskite. Consequently, a stable PCE of 15.5% was achieved for the blade-coated quasi-2D PSCs without thermal assistance, which is the highest performance (based on BA2MA3Pb4I13). The high efficiency is correlated with the effective charge transport and extraction with reduced Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) recombination in the devices, revealed by transient electrical measurements. Through a variable light intensity test, the charge recombination tends to be bimolecular recombination, which is consistent with previous results of a lower density of defects in the blade-coated film. We are sure that the results of quasi-2D PSCs prepared by blade coating without thermal assistance will offer a promising route to promote the performance of quasi-2D PSCs toward practical photovoltaic applications.
Results and discussion
The blade-coating process for quasi-2D perovskite film is illustrated in Fig. 1a. Firstly, the gap between the scraper and ITO needs to be regulated for different thicknesses of substrate sheets. For the processing, only 5 μL of BA2MA3Pb4I13 precursor solution was dropped onto a PTAA/ITO/Glass substrate without preheating, then the solution spread isotropically on the substrate following the scraper controlled by the machine, and the blade-coating speed was 2 cm s−1. A light brown intermediate layer was quickly formed after keeping the precursor film stationary for 2 s, which turned dark-black within 1s. Finally, a dark-black quasi-2D perovskite film with a flat surface was obtained after 10 s of solvent evaporation, as shown in Fig. 1b. All the processes of blade coating for quasi-2D perovskite film were generated in ambient air without thermal assistance, which is beneficial for the combination of stability and easy crystallinity. Note that this is the first time a blade-coated perovskite film has been prepared without thermal assistance during film formation, thereby significantly improving the reproducibility of high-performance PSCs. For the entire blade-coated quasi-2D PSCs, C60, BCP, and Ag were deposited by a thermo-evaporator after the above process. Lastly, the final device was post-annealed at 60 °C for 60 hours in a nitrogen atmosphere.

To investigate the differences between spin-coated and blade-coated quasi-2D perovskite films, we examined the results of XRD and UV absorption spectra, as shown in Fig. 1b and c. The XRD peaks in the blade-coated BA2MA3Pb4I13 film are dominated by the (111) and (202) facets, which is consistent with previous results for spin-coated film. Compared to spin-coated film, the blade-coated film behaved with a stronger peak intensity, which indicates the better crystallinity of BA2MA3Pb4I13 films produced by the blade-coating method. The average crystallite size of quasi-2D perovskite samples was calculated with the Debye–Scherrer formula that further confirmed the results:37,38 (1)where D(111) is the average crystal size of the (111) facet, λ is the X-ray wavelength of 0.154 nm, θ is the Bragg diffraction angle, and β is the full width at half maximum (FWHM). A reduced FWHM of 0.18 was found in the blade-coated film compared to the FWHM of 0.20 in spin-coated film, as fitted by the Gaussian function, which reveals an improved crystal size from 40.6 nm to 45.1 nm. This suggests further enhanced crystallinity of BA2MA3Pb4I13 films processed by the blade-coating method. The excellent crystallinity in the blade-coated film is the result of slow and sufficient crystallization of the precursor solution during the blade-coating process at room temperature. Note that the indicated enlargement in crystal size may reduce the number of grain boundaries and structural defects. In addition, we measured absorption spectra for the spin-coated and blade-coated films, as displayed in Fig. 1b. A darker color was achieved in the blade-coated film due to the sufficient crystallization, in which a considerable mass of 3D (n = ∞) components formed on the top of the film, leading to extended absorption spectra (Fig. 1c, inset). Moreover, the blade-coated film behaved with stronger absorption intensity than spin-coated film, which further ensures the high efficiency obtained in PSCs. Note that a higher quality of the blade-coated film will be achieved after post-annealing treatment, which was proven by the XRD patterns of the two kinds of film (Fig. S1 and S2, ESI†).
To evaluate the charge extraction, we further measured the time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy on these BA2MA3Pb4I13 films based on ITO/PTAA substrates. As the results show in Fig. 1d, there are two temporal regimes in PL decay kinetics: the fast and slow decays delivered from the surface conditions and bulk films. The decay time decreases considerably (τ1 = 3.36 ns, τ2 = 13.45 ns) in the films with blade-coating processing, in comparison to those of spin-coated film (τ1 = 2.08 ns, τ2 = 25.27 ns). In the presence of PTAA, the shortened decay time in the fast decay regime is related to promoted hole transfer through PTAA to the anode, which contributes to the increase in the FF of PSCs with reduced interfacial charge recombination. For the slower decay region, this can be linked to the general picture of carrier accumulation from higher energy to lower energy sites. In the blade-coated film, the considerably decreased decay time in this temporal region indicates that the transfer between various perovskite phases is improved by the formed energetic cascades.
For the steady-state PL spectroscopy of blade-coated film, the PL signal corresponding to the lower-n phases becomes more observable with bottom excitation. In contrast, the strong signal of 3D perovskites with a negligible intensity of lower-n phases occurred with top excitation (see Fig. 1e), which could be ascribed to the order of crystallization being from top to bottom, where the 3D phase preferentially crystallizes at the top, and the two-dimensional phase tends to crystallize later and then form at the bottom. As a consequence, the phases from n = 1 to n = ∞ present a gradient distribution from bottom to top in the blade-coated quasi-2D perovskite films. To further verify the gradient phase alignment in the blade-coated films, we performed incident angle-dependent PL spectroscopy with bottom excitation. The specific test process is shown in Fig. 1f. The light penetration depth decreases with an increase in incidence angle, such that the obtained fluorescence signal can reflect changes in the composition from the bottom toward the top regime inside the film. In the test results, as shown in Fig. 1g, the PL intensity of the 3D (n = ∞) phase decreases alongside the increase in incident angle, indicating that the population of 3D perovskite phase in blade-coated films gradually increases from the bottom toward the top area. The results confirm the gradient phase alignment along the direction of film growth in the order of n-values, which is consistent with the results of steady-state PL.
To investigate the surface morphology of quasi-2D perovskite film, we performed surface analysis by using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) for spin-coated and blade-coated film, as shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. S3 (ESI†), respectively. Note that the surface of the spin-coated film exhibited obvious cracks, while the blade-coated film retained a dense and integral grain after exposure to an electron beam during the SEM test (Fig. 2b). In addition, the spin-coated film is more like a combination of small grains, which have obvious grain boundaries and pinhole defects (as shown in Fig. 2a). On the other hand, the blade-coated film exhibits an average root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 5.49 nm, which is significantly smaller than the 17.9 nm achieved through spin-coating processing, as displayed in Fig. 2c and d. The improved uniformity and smoothness of the bladed perovskite films were attributed to modulation of the crystallization of BA2MA3Pb4I13 films by blade-coating processing with slow solvent evaporation. Note that the flat surface with a lower density of defects (the determined Ntrap reduces to 1.45 × 1015 cm−3, as shown in Fig. S4, ESI†) is significant for limiting non-radiative combination at the interface between the perovskite and electron transport layer.

Moreover, the cross-sectional AFM and SEM images of a quasi-2D perovskite solar cell (PSC) based on a blade-coated BA2MA3Pb4I13 photo-absorber were obtained as displayed in Fig. 2e and f, where the interfaces between different layer components are well visualized. The perovskite section did not show any grain boundaries or cracks, which indicates that a high quality of BA2MA3Pb4I13 films has been achieved by using blade-coating processing. In addition, there is a negligible gap in the contact interface between the perovskite active layer and the ITO/PTAA (full images shown in Fig. S5, ESI†). The close contact in the interface promotes the extraction of carriers by reducing the recombination of carriers, contributing to the high-performance devices.
As described above, the final devices need post-annealing at 60 °C continuously for 60 h in an N2-protected environment to improve the performance of the PSCs. Here, to explore the effect of post-annealing for blade-coated films, we carefully studied the molecular stacking orientations by using grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS), as shown in Fig. 3a and b. Completely opposite to the discrete Bragg spots achieved in spin-coated films, blade-coated films showed an isotropic ring signal. Generally, the feature of Bragg spots can be attributed to a more ordered crystal arrangement, which only exists in quasi-2D perovskites with directionality. The diffraction rings display weaker scattering intensities along with certain extended arc segments, suggesting higher randomness in the crystal orientation, which usually occurred in the isotropic 3D perovskite. Here, all the films displayed diffraction rings before and after post-annealing. This phenomenon can be attributed to slow crystallization leading to an increased thickness of 3D-like perovskite on the top surface of the blade-coated film (as shown in Fig. 3c). Furthermore, we calculated the crystal correlation length (CCL) to assess the ordering in the stacking of crystallographic planes by using the following relation.39 (2)where π is the ratio of circumference to diameter, k is a constant (here a value of 0.9 is used), and Δq is the FWHM of the diffraction peak obtained by the fitting of the Gaussian function. Based on GIWAXS, line-cut profile curves for the in-plane (0°) and out-plane (90°) directions are shown in Fig. 3d. The (111) planes of the pristine film present an in-plane (IP) CCL of 16.15 nm and an out-of-plane (OOP) CCL of 15.70 nm. In comparison, the CCL in the film with post-annealing increases to 18.23 and 16.62 nm in the IP and OOP directions, respectively, suggesting the formation of highly ordered crystals afforded by SPA treatment which is consistent with the results discussed earlier.

As described above, the blade-coated PSCs based on BA2MA3Pb4I13 photo-absorbers were manufactured with the p–i–n structure of indium-tin-oxide (ITO)/poly(triarylamine) (PTAA)/perovskite/C60/BCP/Ag (as shown in Fig. 4a), which is commonly widely used with quasi-2D PSCs. The energy diagrams of each layer in the device are illustrated in Fig. 4b based on a UPS test, as displayed in Fig. S6 (ESI†). PTAA and C60/BCP served as a hole transporting layer and an electron transporting/hole blocking layer, respectively, which facilitates carrier extraction from blade-coated BA2MA3Pb4I13 film. Finally, the key process of post-annealing for the BA2MA3Pb4I13 PSCs took place in an N2-protected environment. As a result, rearrangement of the vertical distribution in multi-perovskite phases was realized, leading to an improved performance of the photovoltaic.

(d) External quantum efficiency spectra (EQE) of different blade-coated quasi-2D PSCs together with integrated short-circuit currents of the respective device (inset text). 
To assess the impact of the post-annealing strategy on the devices, we carefully measured the I–V characteristic under AM 1.5G solar irradiation (100 mW cm−2) for both types of blade-coated PSCs, as displayed in Fig. 4c. From the extracted device parameters (Table 1), considerable enhancements in the three parameters are observed in the thermal-treated devices. After post-annealing, the Jsc increased to 18.22 mA cm−2 from the initial 17.57 mA cm−2. The Voc and PCE dramatically improved from 1.07 to 1.15 V and from 12.78% to 15.47%. To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest reported efficiency for a blade-coated quasi-2D PSC based on BA organic spacers (n = 4). Moreover, the statistical PCEs of two kinds of blade-coated PSCs have been proposed in Fig. S7 (ESI†), which confirms the improved photovoltaic performance by introducing post-annealing treatment. It should be noted that the hysteresis effect is negligible in the thermal device, reflected by the nearly overlapping J–V characteristics in different scan directions (Fig. 4c). To quantify this virtue, we calculated it according to the relation described previously. As a result, the devices with post-annealing are associated with a lowered HI of 0.003 which is much smaller than those of representative high-efficiency 3D PSCs.40–43 The reduced hysteresis is ascribed to minimization of ion migration with the barrier of quasi-2D spacer layers, which enables the fabrication of blade-coated quasi-2D PSCs with good operational stability. These merits ensure comparable efficiency in the blade-coated quasi-2D device to the spin-coated device (Fig. S8, ESI†).

To further confirm the enhanced Jsc with post-annealing, we compared the external quantum efficiencies (EQE) of the corresponding solar cells (the results are shown in Fig. 4d). For both devices, the Jsc based on the integration of EQE exhibits deviations of <5% conforming to the accuracy of the determined device parameters. Overall, the spectral difference is found in the low-energy region (around 700 nm) and high-energy region (around 370 nm) where the photocurrent originates from the absorbed photons in higher n-value components and lower n-value components, respectively. In those regions, we note a more vigorous intensity of EQE spectra in the thermal-treated devices. The reason could be related to the modified vertical phase gradients during post-annealing, such that charges (electrons) arising from low/high-energy photons absorbed by the perovskite active layer are more effectively transported toward the transport layers, eventually contributing to the increase in photocurrent. All these results suggest a reduction of photocarrier losses in the devices modified with post-annealing, which leads to enhanced photovoltaic performance in blade-coated quasi-2D PSCs.
To acquire more understanding of mitigated SRH recombination and enhanced transport properties, we further employed transient photocurrent (TPC) and transient photovoltage (TPV) to evaluate the charge extraction process and carrier lifetime measurement on the blade-coated PSCs with the results displayed in Fig. 5a and b. On the one hand, the recombination lifetime (τrec) in operational devices was determined by TPV measurements in the open-circuit condition (Fig. 5a), where the net current flow is zero and the τrec reflects the lifetime of the photocarriers. Based on the fitting of the mono-exponential decay model, a τrec of 54.35 μs was identified in the devices prepared by blade-coating processing, which is a considerable improvement over that in the spin-coated device (τrec, 38.56 μs). These results agree well with the respective solar cell parameters, which are favorable for the reduction of carrier losses and increase in FF. On the other hand, compared to the spin-coated device (τext, 65.24 ns), the blade-coated devices with thermal treatment show a speedier charge sweep out with a shortened charge extraction time of 40.16 ns (τext) under short-circuit conditions (Fig. 5b). As a result, enhanced charge extraction efficiency minimizes interfacial charge accumulation and resultant carrier loss via recombination, which leads to the enlarged Jsc and Voc.44–46

(d) Open-circuit voltage (Voc)/short circuit current (Jsc) versus light intensity characteristics of blade-coated BA2MA3Pb4I13 solar cells. Inset text: Determined slopes were based on linear fittings. 
To further prove the reduced charge recombination and facilitated charge extraction in blade-coated quasi-2D PSCs, we implemented light intensity (Plight)-dependent J–V measurements, as shown in Fig. 5c. As is known, the diode ideality factor (IF) determined from the slope of the Vocvs. Plight plot usually weights the type of recombination. In general, a slope of 2kT/q (where k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature and q is the elementary charge) implies that SRH recombination involving traps plays a significant role, and the slope reducing to 1kT/q means that 2nd-order bi-molecular recombination induced by hole–electron recombination dominates.47–49
In our study, a slope 1.49kBT/q was obtained, which unambiguously confirms the suppression of SRH charge recombination in the blade-coated PSCs. In addition, we also obtained the slope of Jsc ∝ Plight. The relation between these two parameters obeys the general power law of Jsc ∝ Pαlight, with the power α being an exponential factor. In a solar cell where the recombination adopts a monomolecular path, the power should approach unity. As a result, we extracted an α value of 0.95 for the blade-coated devices, which is consistent with the blade-coated method presenting high-quality BA2MA3Pb4I13 films with suppressed monomolecular recombination.
Conclusions
In summary, we fabricated blade-coated BA2MA3Pb4I13 PSCs with non-thermal assistance in ambient atmospheres for the first time and meticulously explored them. We found that blade-coated BA2MA3Pb4I13 films sustain high-quality crystallinity caused by slow solvent evaporation without annealing, leading to a lower density of defects. As a result, a blade-coated quasi-2D perovskite film not only demonstrates a high absorption coefficient but also boosts the growth of quasi-2D and 3D-like phase components toward the vertical phase distribution from the bottom to the top area of perovskite films. These advantages introduced by blade-coating processing lead to a high PCE of 15.47%, which is one of the highest performances of BA2MA3Pb4I13 PSCs (n = 4). Finally, the enhanced charge extraction efficiency achieved by limiting interfacial charge accumulation and resultant carrier loss via recombination was carefully illustrated by implementing a transient photoelectric test and light intensity-dependent J–V measurements. The results presented in this work enrich the processing methodologies dealing with the formation of quasi-2D films for PSCs. Moreover, the effort of this work greatly enhances the feasibility of the blade-coating method for use in fabricating high-performance quasi-2D PSC with long-term stability, which is urgently needed in volume manufacturing of PSCs.
Experimental section
Solution preparation and device fabrication
0.9 M BA2MA3Pb4I13 precursor solutions were prepared by dissolving MAI (99.5%, Xi'an Polymer Light Technology Corp), BAI (99.5%, Xi'an Polymer Light Technology Corp) and PbI2 (99.9985%, Alfa Aesar) in mixed solvents of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, 99.9%, Aladdin) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (volume ratio 97:3) with a molar ratio of 2:3:4. PTAA (Xi'an Polymer Light Technology Corp) was dissolved in toluene with a concentration of 2 mg mL−1. ITO substrates were cleaned by sonication in water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol sequentially and then dried in an oven before use. The cleaned substrates were treated with UV-O3 for 15 min. The hole transporting layer was attained by spin-coating the PTAA solution (chlorobenzene) at a spin-rate of 6000 rpm for 30 s. The gap between the scraper and ITO needs to be regulated for different thicknesses of substrate sheets. For the processing, only 5 μL of BA2MA3Pb4I13 precursor solution was dropped onto a PTAA/ITO/Glass substrate without preheating, then the solution spread isotropically on the substrate following the scraper controlled by the machine and the blade-coating speed was 2 cm s−1. A light brown intermediate layer was quickly formed after keeping the precursor film stationary for 2 s which then turned dark-black within 1 s. Finally, a dark-black quasi-2D perovskite film with a flat surface was obtained after 10 s of solvent evaporation. All the processes of blade coating for quasi-2D perovskite film were generated in ambient air without thermal assistance, which is beneficial for the combination of stability and easy crystallinity. Afterward, 30 nm of C60 and 9 nm BCP were respectively deposited on top of the active layer by thermal evaporation. Finally, 80 nm of Ag cathode was evaporated through shadow masks under vacuum <1 × 10−4 Pa.
For the post-annealing treatment, the complete devices were placed on a hot plate at 60 °C in an N2-filled glove box continuously for 60 hours without any disturbance. Then the devices were taken out from the hot plate and naturally cooled in the glove box before testing.
Characterization
Photovoltaic J–V characteristics of the quasi-2DRP-PCSs were measured using a Keithley 2400 Sourcemeter under nitrogen atmosphere irradiated by an AAA solar simulator at 100 mW cm−2 using an AM 1.5G filter and calibrated by a standard Si reference cell. The J–V curves were collected using a fixed voltage interval of 10 mV and dwelling time of 100 ms by setting the delay at each voltage step before measuring the current. The effective device area was 0.04 cm2, defined by the overlap of the electrodes. For Vocversus light intensity characterization, the light intensity was adjusted by placing an optical wheel filter in front of the incident light beam and calibrated using a certified Si reference cell. The EQE spectra were performed on a Newport external quantum measurement system (Model 66920). AFM topographic images were captured by using a Bruker MultiMode 8 microscope in the tapping mode. XRD patterns were recorded by using a Rigaku D/MAX-TTRIII3 (CBO) X-ray diffractometer equipped with a push-plug Gobel mirror and a monochromatic CuKα (λ = 1.5405 Å) radiation source. GIWAXS measurements were carried out on a Xenocs Xeuss SAXS/WAXS beamline system based on an X-ray wavelength of 0.6887 Å. The absorption spectroscopy was collected by using a UV-vis spectrometer (PerkinElmer Lambda 650/850/950 UV-vis spectrophotometer) in the spectral range of 200–850 nm. Steady-state and time-resolved PL spectroscopy was measured with a HORIBA Jobin–Yvon Fluorolog-III fluorimeter in the steady and transient modes, respectively, with the excitation provided by a 509 nm semiconductor diode laser and the data were analyzed by Data Analysis Software. Temperature-dependent PL spectra were obtained by using the same fluorimeter system as for steady-state PL with the samples mounted into a liquid helium cycled cryostat that was positionally coupled to the sample chamber and incident light beam. The temperature was controlled by a temperature controller (Lakeshore, Inc.) and for thermal equilibrium, there was a wait of at least 20 min before starting measurement at each pre-set temperature point.
