The structure and optical properties of the Ag/Ag3PO4/TiO2 nanotube electrode were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy and electrochemical techniques. The photoelectrocatalytic (PEC) activity of the composite electrode was evaluated by the decomposition of 2-chlorophenol under visible light irradiation (λ > 420 nm). Clusters of Ag/Ag3PO4 nanoparticles were successfully formed on the surface of the TiO2 nanotubes (NTs) causing no damage to the ordered structure of the nanotubes. The PL intensity of Ag/Ag3PO4/TiO2 NTs was much lower than that of TiO2 nanotubes. The p-type Ag3PO4 and Ag nanoparticles deposited on the TiO2 NTs could promote the transfer of photo-generated electrons, which inhibited the recombination of electrons and holes effectively, leading to a significant increase in the photocurrent density. Moreover, the Ag/Ag3PO4/TiO2 heterostructure photoelectrodes showed much higher PEC activity than the pure TiO2 NTs for the degradation of 2-CP aqueous solution under visible light irradiation. The enhanced PEC activity could be attributed to the visible-light photocatalytic activity of Ag3PO4 and the heterostructure between Ag3PO4 and TiO2. The electron spin resonance (ESR) spin-trap study further demonstrated that ˙OH could be generated on the Ag/Ag3PO4/TiO2 NTs under visible light irradiation.IntroductionWell-ordered arrays of one-dimensional semiconductors have attracted much interest in the last decade as electrode architectures for optoelectronic applications. 1D TiO2 nanotube arrays (TiO2 NTs) prepared by the electrochemical anodization of self-organized porous structures on Ti foil have been investigated by many researchers in recent years.1–5 Several recent studies indicated that TiO2 NTs had improved properties compared to any other form of titania for photocatalysis,6,7 the generation of hydrogen from water splitting,8,9 solar energy conversion,10–12 the anodes of lithium ion batteries3,13 and sensors for detecting chemical oxygen demands14 and trace levels hydrogen gas.15 However, because of its large band gap (∼3.05 eV for rutile and 3.15 eV for anatase),16 the activation of its photocatalytic capability requires ultraviolet light (λ < 400 nm) that contributes less than 5% of the total energy of the solar spectrum.6,17,18 In addition, the low efficiency of electron–hole separation limits the practical application of TiO2 NTs in photoelectrochemical and photocatalytic processes.19–21 To overcome these problems, many modified approaches have been reported.22–24 In addition, various methods have been developed to extend the absorption capability of TiO2 NTs into the visible light region.25–33 One promising way is to combine TiO2 with a suitable semiconductor that possesses a narrower band gap, such as CdS,34,35 CdTe,36,37 CdSe,38,39 Cu2O,40 Fe2O3,41 BiOI,42 and ZnFe2O4.43 Under visible light irradiation, these narrower band gap semiconductors act as sensitizers and facilitate the electron transfer to TiO2 in the heterojunction nanocomposites, assisting the charge separation and improving the visible-light photocatalytic activity simultaneously.During the past few decades, numerous Ag-based semiconductor materials have been developed for photocatalytic water-splitting and the degradation of organics in wastewater. Recently, Ye's research group reported the use of a Ag3PO4 semiconductor as an active visible light driven photocatalyst for water oxidation and the photodecomposition of organic compounds.44–46 More specifically, a quantum efficiency of up to 90% can be achieved for O2 evolution under visible light irradiation. Ag3PO4 is well known as a photosensitive material and regarded as an appropriate candidate for the construction of heterostructures with TiO2. Yao and his co-workers deposited visible-light-active Ag3PO4 nanoparticles onto the surface of TiO2 (P25) by a facile process and demonstrated their enhanced photocatalytic activity for the degradation of methylene blue (MB) and rhodamine B (RhB) under visible light irradiation.47 Rawal and co-workers reported that novel heterojunction structures of Ag3PO4/TiO2 were fabricated by covering the surface of Ag3PO4 with polycrystalline TiO2 through sol–gel process. The composite showed remarkably high photocatalytic activity for the removal of gaseous 2-propanol under visible-light irradiation.48 However, Ag3PO4 is subject to stability issues in practical applications because it is prone to photoreduction and decomposition if no sacrificial reagent is supplied. Our previous studies have shown that elemental silver Ag0 on the surface of Ag3PO4 may act as an electron acceptor to enhance the charge separation and prevent the reductive decomposition of Ag3PO4.49 Meanwhile, metallic silver species can significantly absorb visible light due to the effect of surface plasmon resonance. Thus, by combining TiO2 NTs and Ag/Ag3PO4 nanoparticles to constitute a double heterostructure, both the utilization of visible light and the surface–interface charge transfer efficiency of photo-generated carriers could be improved while the stability of the composite electrode may be simultaneously enhanced.Herein, we report highly ordered n-type TiO2 NTs decorated with p-type Ag3PO4 and Ag nanoparticles prepared by a two-step approach, including sequential chemical bath deposition followed by partial reduction of Ag+ ions in the Ag3PO4 nanoparticles to Ag0 under UV irradiation. The visible light photocatalytic activity of the Ag/Ag3PO4/TiO2 heterostructure photoelectrodes was evaluated by degrading 2-chlorophenol (2-CP) in aqueous solution.Preparation of Ag/Ag3PO4/TiO2 nanotube arraysAll solvents and reagents were of analytical grade and used as received. Electrolyte was freshly prepared from deionized water. The highly ordered TiO2 NTs were synthesized by the anodic oxidation of Ti foil in an HF electrolyte, similar to that described previously.50 The detailed experimental procedure can be found in the ESI.† The p-type Ag3PO4 nanoparticles were deposited onto the crystallized TiO2 nanotubes by a sequential chemical bath deposition method as reported by others previously.51 The TiO2 NTs were sequentially dipped into two different beakers. First, the TiO2 NT electrode was immersed in an aqueous solution containing silver nitrate (AgNO3) for 30 min. It was then transferred to the next beaker containing 0.03 M NaH2PO4 solution and kept in there for 5 min. Finally, the electrode sample was rinsed with DI water. This preparation procedure was repeated for a number of times. The composites obtained were dried under vacuum at a temperature of 333 K for 1 h. Finally, the as-prepared samples were irradiated by UV light in 0.1 M methanol solution using a 300 W high-pressure mercury lamp with an intensity of 1.4 mW cm−2. The irradiation time was about one minute, which was sufficient to induce the photocatalytic reduction of Ag+ to Ag in the form of nanoparticles, as depicted in Scheme 1. The desired amount of Ag/Ag3PO4 nanoparticles on the surface was obtained after several repetitions of the ultrasonication and deposition procedure. Detailed experimental conditions can be found in Table S1.† Scheme 1  The preparation of the Ag/Ag3PO4/TiO2 NTs. CharacterizationThe morphology of the Ag/Ag3PO4/TiO2 NT electrode was characterized using a scanning electron microscope (JEOLJSM-6360LV microscope) with an accelerating voltage of 30.0 kV. The dopant concentration was verified by energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX, Horiba 7593H) using Link Isis Series 300 software. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) analysis was conducted with a JEM-2100F electron microscope (JEOL, Japan), using a 200 kV accelerating voltage. The crystalline phase of the samples was characterized using a Rigaku D/Max 2550VB/PC X-ray diffractometer with a Cu Kα radiation source (k = 0.154056 nm), and operated at a voltage of 40 kV and a current of 30 mA. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy data were recorded with a Perkin-Elmer PHI 5600 electron spectrometer using acrochromatic Al Kα radiation (1486.6 eV) with Ar+ sputtering to remove the surface layer of the sample. All of the binding energies were calibrated by using the contaminant carbon (C 1s) at 284.6 eV as a reference. The light absorption properties were measured using a UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectrophotometer (JASCO, UV-550) with a wavelength range of 200–800 nm. The photoluminescence (PL) characteristics were probed using a Hitachi F-4500 fluorescence spectrophotometer. The electron spin resonance (ESR) signals of the radicals trapped by 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO) were detected at ambient temperature with a Bruker (E 500) spectrometer. The irradiation source was a Quanta-Ray Nd: YAG pulsed laser system (λ = 532 nm, 10 Hz). The settings for the ESR spectrometer were as follows: center field = 3510 G; sweep width = 200 G; microwave frequency = 9.85 GHz; modulation frequency = 100 kHz; and power = 20 mW. To minimize measurement errors, the same quartz capillary tube was used throughout the ESR measurements.Photoelectrochemical measurements were performed using a conventional three-electrode cell system and a CHI 760c (CHI Co., USA) electrochemical workstation. The Ag/Ag3PO4/TiO2 NT electrode was employed as the working electrode. Meanwhile, a platinum electrode and a saturated calomel electrode served as the counter and reference electrodes, respectively. The working electrode was irradiated by visible light (420 nm < λ) through a UV-cutoff filter (Shanghai Seagull Colored Optical Glass Co., Ltd.) from a high-pressure xenon short arc lamp (a Phillips 500 W Xe lamp). The incident visible light intensity was 35.5 mW cm−2, which was measured with a radiometer (Photoelectric Instrument Factory Beijing Normal University, model FZ-A). The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was operated in the frequency range of 10−2 to 105 Hz with an ac voltage amplitude of 10 mV at a dc bias of 0.3 V vs. the saturated calomel electrode (SCE) in a 0.01 M Na2SO4 electrolyte.Photoelectrocatalytic activity testThe PEC oxidation of 2-CP was carried out in a round-bottom quartz reactor. All of the experiments were performed with magnetic stirring, using 0.01 M Na2SO4 as the electrolyte. The initial concentration of the 2-CP aqueous solution was 20 mg L−1. Dark (adsorption) experiments were carried out for 30 min, under continuous stirring, to allow sufficient 2-CP to be adsorbed onto the surface of the catalyst.Results and discussionPreparation and characterization of photocatalystsFrom Fig. 1a, it can be observed that the average diameter of the highly ordered, well aligned TiO2 nanotubes is about 100 nm and the wall thickness is around 20 nm. The high-magnification SEM image of the sample, Fig. 1b, shows the nanotube structure more clearly. The details of the mechanism of formation of the TiO2 tubular array structure on a titanium substrate have been described elsewhere.52,53 Uniformly dispersed Ag/Ag3PO4 nanoparticles, with a diameter of approximately 20 nm, are successfully grown in the vertically oriented TiO2 nanotube arrays (Fig. 1c and d). It is noteworthy that the Ag/Ag3PO4/TiO2 heterostructure photoelectrodes still have a high level of orientation and open top characteristics without losing their architectural structure after Ag/Ag3PO4 nanoparticle deposition (Fig. 1e and f), which is essential for the high photocatalytic activity and electron-transfer efficiency. The electron diffusion length for the ordered nanotubes is much higher than that for comparable nanoparticle layers due to lower surface recombination. The tubular arrangement provides highly defined electron and ion transport properties for photocatalytic reaction systems.52,54 Fig. 1  Morphologies of the TiO2 nanotube arrays: (a) a typical top-view SEM image of the TiO2 NTs; (b) an image of the TiO2 NTs at high magnification; (c) top-view SEM image of the Ag/Ag3PO4/TiO2 NTs; (d) an image of Ag/Ag3PO4/TiO2 NTs at high magnification; (e) a cross-sectional view of the Ag/Ag3PO4/TiO2 NTs; and (f) a side-view image of Ag/Ag3PO4/TiO2 NTs at high magnification. The low- and high-magnification HRTEM images of the TiO2 NTs after the incorporation of Ag/Ag3PO4 nanoparticles are displayed in Fig. 2. A more precise size distribution of Ag/Ag3PO4 nanoparticles throughout the TiO2 nanotube surface could be observed from Fig. 2a. Fig. 2b and c show high-magnification TEM images of Ag/Ag3PO4/TiO2 NTs. The size of the nanoparticles ranges from 5 to 10 nm. The observed lattice fringes of 0.351 nm in the image (Fig. 2b) correspond to the (101) plane of anatase (JPCDS 21-1272), suggesting that the side walls of the TiO2 nanotubes are well crystallized. The observed lattice spacings of 0.234 and 0.269 nm, seen beside the nanotubes, correspond to the (111) planes of Ag (JPCDS 04-0783) and (210) planes of Ag3PO4 (JPCDS 06-0505), respectively. These results confirm that Ag/Ag3PO4 nanoparticles have been successfully combined with the TiO2 nanotube arrays. The prepared TiO2 NTs loaded with Ag/Ag3PO4 nanoparticles were also investigated by checking the elemental signature of the EDX spectrum (Fig. 2d). The results further confirm that the Ag/Ag3PO4/TiO2 NTs were composed of O, Ag, P and Ti elements. The proportions of O, Ag, P and Ti elements were 23.86, 8.59, 0.38 and 66.81, respectively. Fig. 2  (a) TEM images of the TiO2 NTs after Ag/Ag3PO4 nanoparticle deposition onto the surface of the nanotubes; (b and c) HRTEM images of the Ag/Ag3PO4/TiO2 NTs; and (d) the corresponding EDX spectrum of the Ag/Ag3PO4/TiO2 NTs. Fig. 3 shows the XRD patterns of the TiO2 NTs and Ag/Ag3PO4/TiO2 NTs. The pattern of the TiO2 NTs is in good agreement with those of the Ti metal phase (JCPDS file no. 05-0682) and anatase phase of TiO2 (JCPDS file no. 21-1272). The XRD results of the Ag/Ag3PO4/TiO2 electrode nanotube arrays reveals peaks at 2θ values of 20.9°, 29.7°, 33.3°, 55.0° and 57.3°. These peaks can be indexed to the (110), (200), (210), (320) and (321) crystal planes of Ag3PO4 (JCPDS file no. 06-0505). The peaks located at 38.1° 44.3° and 77.5° can be attributed to the (111), (200) and (311) planes of Ag (JCPDS file no. 04-0783). These results prove that Ag/Ag3PO4 nanoparticles have been successfully deposited onto the surface of the TiO2 NTs. The high intensity of the peaks suggests that the Ag/Ag3PO4 nanoparticles actually have the crystalline structure as expected from the HRTEM images. Fig. 3  XRD patterns of the TiO2 NTs and Ag/Ag3PO4/TiO2 NTs. The overall chemical composition of the as-prepared Ag/Ag3PO4/TiO2 NTs is shown in Fig. 4a–d. The peaks corresponding to Ti, Ag, P and O were documented. The detailed spectra for Ag are shown in Fig. 4b. Two bands at 368.3 and 374.3 eV are observed and can be ascribed to the Ag 3d5/2 and Ag 3d3/2 binding energies, respectively, which is consistent with the results reported by other researchers.55,56 The Ag 3d5/2 and Ag 3d3/2 peaks can be further divided into two separate peaks at 368.0, 368.5 eV and 373.8, 374.5 eV, respectively. According to the results reported by Arabatzis and co-workers,57 and Liu and co-workers,58 the peaks at 374.5 and 368.5 eV can be attributed to Ag0 because of the splitting of the 3d doublet at 6.0 eV, whereas the peaks at 373.8 and 368.0 eV can be attributed to the Ag+ ions of Ag3PO4. The XPS spectra of O 1s of the Ag/Ag3PO4/TiO2 NTs were fitted using Gaussian–Lorentzian peak shapes. The major peak at 529.8 eV is attributed to lattice oxygen, whereas a weak peak at 532.4 eV is due to the presence of surface hydroxyl groups.59,60 Fig. 4  (a) XPS survey spectrum of Ag/Ag3PO4/TiO2 NTs. (b) XPS spectrum of Ag 3d. (c) XPS spectrum of O 1s. (d) XPS spectrum of P 2p. The UV-vis diffuse reflection spectra of pure TiO2, Ag/TiO2, Ag3PO4/TiO2 and Ag/Ag3PO4/TiO2 NTs are displayed in Fig. 5. The absorption edge of the sample loaded with Ag/Ag3PO4 nanoparticles show a significantly red-shift with respect to pure TiO2. Both the Ag and Ag3PO4 nanoparticles could absorb photons around 450 nm. Because the absorption peak shape of the Ag/Ag3PO4/TiO2 NT electrode is more similar to that of the Ag/TiO2 NTs at 450 nm, it is speculated that the main contribution to the absorption peak around 450 nm is from the surface plasmon resonance of the metallic Ag nanoparticles in the Ag/Ag3PO4/TiO2 NTs.61,62 Fig. 5  The DRS spectra of the as-prepared TiO2 NTs and Ag/Ag3PO4/TiO2. PL spectra of TiO2 and the Ag/Ag3PO4/TiO2 NTs are shown in Fig. 6. The peak position near 400 nm is very close to the results reported in literature (412 nm), indicating that this band probably originates from the intrinsic states rather than the surface states.63,64 Thus, the 400 nm band should be assigned to self-trapped excitations localized on TiO2 nanotube arrays. The peaks located at 466 and 528 nm in Fig. 6 are coincident with oxygen vacancies.65 The PL intensity of the Ag/Ag3PO4/TiO2 NTs was much lower than that of the TiO2 nanotubes, indicating that the deposition of Ag/Ag3PO4 nanoparticles has improved the charge separation effectively. Fig. 6  The PL spectra of the as-prepared TiO2 NTs and Ag/Ag3PO4/TiO2 with an excitation wavelength of 325 nm. Photoelectrochemical measurementsRepresentative current density versus voltage (I–V) characteristics of the as-prepared electrodes are presented in Fig. 7. Potentiodynamic scans on the TiO2 and Ag/Ag3PO4/TiO2 NTs electrode were performed from −1.0 to 1.0 V vs. SCE with a scanning rate of 2 mV s−1 under visible light irradiation. As shown in Fig. 7a, a significant increase in the photocurrent density was observed across the potential window for the modified nanotube arrays under visible light irradiation. The performance of the modified electrode in the dark is slightly better than pure TiO2, but much worse than under visible light as expected (Fig. 7b). Fig. 8 shows the total percent photoconversion efficiency (η) as a function of the applied potential for the TiO2 and Ag/Ag3PO4/TiO2 NTs under visible light irradiation.66 A maximum photoconversion efficiency of 1.76% was observed for the Ag/Ag3PO4/TiO2 NT electrode, while it was only 0.12% for the TiO2 NTs. The photoconversion efficiency, η, of light energy to chemical energy in the presence of an external applied potential, Eapp, is calculated as:η (%) = jp[Erev − |Eapp|] × 100/I0Where jp is the photocurrent density (mA cm−2), Erev is the standard state-reversible potential (which is 1.23 V (vs. NHE). Eapp is the applied potential derived from: Eapp = Emeas − Eaoc, where Emeas is the electrode potential of the working electrode at which the photocurrent was measured under illumination and Eaoc is the electrode potential of the same working electrode under open circuit conditions, under the same illumination, and in the same electrolyte. In addition, I0 is the power density of incident light (mW cm−2). Furthermore, the transient photocurrent responses of the TiO2 and Ag/Ag3PO4/TiO2 NT electrodes were recorded via several on–off cycles of irradiation to give further evidence for the visible light activity of the Ag/Ag3PO4/TiO2 NTs (Fig. 9). Prompt generation of photocurrent can be observed for the Ag/Ag3PO4-modified TiO2 NTs upon illumination with visible light. The rise and fall of the photocurrent corresponds well to the illumination being switched on and off. In Fig. 9, the photocurrent density of the Ag/Ag3PO4/TiO2 NTs is greater than 0.25 mA cm−2, whereas that of TiO2 NTs is almost zero. Fig. 7  (a) I–V curves of the as-prepared TiO2 NTs and Ag/Ag3PO4/TiO2 NTs under visible light irradiation; (b) I–V curves of the as-prepared Ag/Ag3PO4/TiO2 NTs in the dark and under visible light irradiation, respectively. (The applied potential vs. SCE is used as the reference electrode.)  Fig. 8  Photoconversion efficiency as a function of the applied potential vs. SCE.  Fig. 9  Transient photocurrent response of the as-prepared TiO2 NTs and Ag/Ag3PO4/TiO2 NTs under visible light irradiation. The separation and transfer of electron and hole pairs can be analysed using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS).41 The radius of the arc on the EIS Nyquist plot reflects the reaction rate occurring at the surface of electrode. As shown in Fig. 10, the arc radius of the Ag/Ag3PO4/TiO2 NTs is smaller than that of the TiO2 NTs under visible light irradiation, which suggests that having Ag/Ag3PO4 nanoparticles on the TiO2 NTs leads to a more effective separation of photo-generated electron–hole pairs and faster interfacial charge transfer.67 The Mott–Schottky plots calculated from the EIS provide a qualitative comparison for the different samples. The Mott–Schottky plots of different samples are shown in Fig. S1.† As TiO2 is a well-known n-type semiconductor, the TiO2 NTs measured had a positive slope. On the contrary, a negative slope was observed for the Ag/Ag3PO4/TiO2 NT sample. This clearly indicates that the majority of the carriers, which are pushed into the depletion layer of the semiconductor by the positive bias, are positive holes and that these electrodes are p-type semiconductors. In other words, Ag3PO4 is a p-type semiconductor. Compared to the pristine TiO2 NTs, the Ag/Ag3PO4/TiO2 NT electrode shows a much flatter slope in the Mott–Schottky plots under visible light irradiation near the flat band potential. These results prove that the p-type Ag3PO4 and Ag nanoparticles deposited onto the TiO2 NTs can promote the transfer of photo-generated electrons, inhibiting the recombination of electrons and holes effectively. Fig. 10  (a) EIS Nyquist plots of Ag/Ag3PO4/TiO2 NTs in the dark and under visible light irradiation and (b) EIS Nyquist plots of TiO2 NTs and Ag/Ag3PO4/TiO2 NTs under visible light irradiation. Photocatalytic activityFig. 11a shows a comparison of the electrochemical process (EC), the photocatalytic (PC) process, and PEC activity of the Ag/Ag3PO4/TiO2 NTs for the degradation of 2-CP. Obviously, the PEC process is the most efficient for degrading 2-CP, with nearly 95% decomposed after 240 minutes under visible light irradiation. Meanwhile only 60% of 2-CP degradation was obtained in the PC process during the same illumination time. The degradation by the EC was even less significant with about 35% of 2-CP decomposed. In addition, the degradation efficiency of 2-CP only reached 20% during the direct photolysis (DP) process. The results show that the applied bias potential inhibited the recombination of the photo-generated hole–electron pairs effectively and prolonged the lifetime of the photo-generated charge carriers. A pseudo-first-order kinetic model was employed to fit the degradation data by using the linear transformation: −ln (Ct/C0) = F(t) = kt (k is the kinetic constant), as shown in Fig. 11b. The kinetic constants of 2-CP oxidation in the DP, EC, PC, and PEC processes are 1.3 × 10−3, 2.2 × 10−3, 4.7 × 10−3, and 1.2 × 10−2 min−1, respectively. Fig. 11  (a) Decontamination of 2-CP solutions by different processes with the as-prepared Ag/Ag3PO4/TiO2 NT electrode. (b) The kinetics of 2-CP degradation using Ag/Ag3PO4/TiO2 NTs by different processes. The performance of different materials in the PEC process is shown in Fig. 12. Under visible light irradiation, nearly 95% of 2-CP was degraded by the Ag/Ag3PO4/TiO2 NTs in the photoelectrocatalytic process after 240 min, while 72%, 36% and 25% of 2-CP was degraded by the Ag3PO4/TiO2 NTs, Ag/TiO2 NTs and non-loaded TiO2 NTs (Fig. 12a). The corresponding kinetic constants of 2-CP degradation were determined from the data in Fig. 12b. The corresponding kinetic constants of the Ag/Ag3PO4/TiO2 NTs, Ag3PO4/TiO2 NTs, Ag/TiO2 NTs and TiO2 NTs are 1.1 × 10−2, 5.0 × 10−3, 2.1 × 10−3 and 1.3 × 10−3, respectively. Fig. 12  (a) Decontamination of 2-CP by photoelectrocatalysis with the TiO2 NTs, Ag/TiO2 NTs, Ag3PO4/TiO2 NTs and the Ag/Ag3PO4/TiO2 NT electrode under visible light irradiation at an applied bias of 0.6 V vs. SCE, respectively. (b) The kinetics of 2-CP degradation by TiO2 NTs, Ag/TiO2 NTs, Ag3PO4/TiO2 NTs and the Ag/Ag3PO4/TiO2 NT electrode. Hydroxyl radical analysisFig. 13a shows the changes in the PL spectra of terephthalic acid solution under visible light irradiation with the irradiation time. A gradual increase of PL intensity at about 426 nm occurred for the as-prepared Ag/Ag3PO4/TiO2 NT electrode. This suggests that the fluorescence is caused by the chemical reactions between terephthalic acid and the ˙OH species that are formed during photoelectrocatalytic reaction.68,69 These results confirm that ˙OH species were generated on the Ag/Ag3PO4/TiO2 NT electrode under visible light irradiation. Fig. 13  (a) PL spectral changes with visible light irradiation time for the Ag/Ag3PO4/TiO2 NT electrode in 5 × 10−4 M basic solution of terephthalic acid. (b) DMPO spin-trapping ESR spectra recorded at ambient temperature in an aqueous dispersion: Ag/Ag3PO4/TiO2 NTs in the dark and under visible light irradiation (λ = 532 nm, 10 Hz, the signals were recorded after visible light irradiation for 60 s). An ESR spin-trap technique (with DMPO) was employed to further characterize the photo-generated reactive oxygen species on the Ag/Ag3PO4/TiO2 NTs under visible light irradiation. Four peaks, characteristic of DMPO–˙OH, with an intensity ratio of 1:2:2:1 are clearly observed in the ESR spectrum. This spectrum is similar to that reported in other research for the ˙OH adduct,63 indicating that ˙OH was really generated on the Ag/Ag3PO4/TiO2 NTs under visible light irradiation. In contrast, no ˙OH signals were detected in the Ag/Ag3PO4/TiO2 NT systems in the dark.Based on the above discussion, a possible photocatalytic mechanism may be proposed as follows. Under visible light irradiation (λ > 420 nm), photo-generated electron–hole pairs emerge from both the Ag nanoparticles (eqn (1)) and the photoexcited Ag3PO4 semiconductor. The photo-generated electrons from the plasmon-excited Ag nanoparticles (Ag*) transfer across the interface of the Ag/TiO2 to the surface of the TiO2 NTs farthest away from the Ag/Ag3PO4 nanoparticles (eqn (2)). Simultaneously, the holes left behind diffuse to the surface of the Ag3PO4 nanoparticles and cause the oxidation of H2O to ˙OH (eqn (3)). On the other hand, Ag3PO4 could be easily excited by visible light and generate electron–hole pairs (eqn (4)). Metallic Ag species on the surface of the Ag/Ag3PO4/TiO2 NTs mainly act as electron acceptors, enhancing the separation of the electrons and holes (eqn (5)) and the subsequent transfer of the trapped electrons to the TiO2 conduction band. Some of the photo-generated holes accumulated in Ag3PO4 could interact with surface-bound H2O or OH− to produce the ˙OH species (eqn (6)). Furthermore, the photoelectrons arriving at the counter electrode surface could react with the adsorbed molecular oxygen to yield O2˙− (eqn (7)). Therefore, highly oxidative species, such as ˙OH, O2˙−and holes are produced, which then react with the 2-CP in solution (eqn (8)). According to the above analysis, the relevant reactions at the composite electrode surface can be expressed as follows: Ag + hv → Ag*(1) Ag* + TiO2 → Ag+˙ + TiO2(e−)(2) Ag+˙ + H2O → ˙OH + H+(3) Ag3PO4 + hv → h+ + e−(4) Ag3PO4(e−) + Ag → Ag3PO4 + Ag(e−)(5) Counter electrode (e−) + O2 → O2˙−(6) Ag3PO4 (h+) + H2O → ˙OH + H+(7) O2˙−, ˙OH, h+ + 2-CP → H2O + CO2 + other inorganic molecules(8)ConclusionIn summary, Ag/Ag3PO4/TiO2 heterostucture photoelectrodes have been successfully prepared by using a sequential chemical bath deposition and UV-reduction method. The incorporation of Ag/Ag3PO4 nanoparticles onto TiO2 NTs extends the absorption spectrum of the TiO2 NTs significantly into visible region. The photoelectrochemical performance of the Ag/Ag3PO4/TiO2 NTs indicated that the Ag/Ag3PO4 nanoparticles on the surface of TiO2 NTs lead to a significant increase in the photocurrent density and a more effective separation of photo-generated electron–hole pairs. More significantly, the Ag/Ag3PO4/TiO2 heterostructure photoelectrodes possess much higher photoelectrocatalytic activity than the pure TiO2 NTs for the degradation of 2-CP in aqueous solution under visible light irradiation. Consequently, the Ag/Ag3PO4/TiO2 heterostructure photoelectrodes described herein may be used in a wide range of applications including photocatalysis and solar cells.AcknowledgementsThis work was supported financially by the National Nature Science Foundation of China (NSFC-RGC 21061160495, 21207015, 21250110513, N_HKUST646/10), the National High Technology Research and Development Program of China (863 Program) (no. 2010AA064902), the Excellent Talents Program of Liaoning Provincial University (LR2010090) and the Key Laboratory of Industrial Ecology and Environmental Engineering, China Ministry of Education.ReferencesE.
