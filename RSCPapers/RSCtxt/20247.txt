    , Accepted 22nd July 2014First published on 22nd July 2014AbstractUltrathin, two-dimensional (2D) nanosheets of layered transition-metal chalcogenides are theoretically and technologically intriguing. However, it still remains a great challenge to synthesize ultrathin nanosheets because of the lack of an intrinsic driving force for the anisotropic growth of 2D superposed microstructures. Here we demonstrate, for the first time to our knowledge, the in situ synthesis of large-scale ultrathin Sb2S3 nanosheets on graphene sheets (G) by solvothermal method in a water–ethylene glycol mixed solvent. Owing to the synergetic chemical coupling effects between G and Sb2S3, Sb2S3–G hybrid nanosheets exhibit high catalytic performance for the degradation of methylene blue in the presence of H2O2. Moreover, it was found that the resulting Sb2S3–G shows good electrocatalytic activity towards hydrazine oxidation. This work not only offers a low-cost and high performance alternative technology for synthesizing sheet-like Sb2S3, but also opens the door toward the fabrication of varying types of metal sulfide–graphene nanomaterials that will have wide applications in catalysis, environmental, and new energy fields.
1. Introduction
Graphene, a single-atom-thick sheet of sp2 hybridized carbon atoms, is considered to be a promising nanoscale building block for nanoelectronic devices due to its unique electronic and optical properties.1–3 Among the graphene family, graphene oxide (GO) is an oxidized graphene with rich oxygen functional groups (e.g., –OH, –COOH, epoxy), and has been employed as a template to synthesize various kinds of nanomaterials such as metals, oxides, and chalcogenides.4–6 In particular, graphene has the fastest known electron mobility of ∼1.5 × 104 cm2 V−1 s−1, and has been demonstrated to be an excellent electron acceptor in graphene–semiconductor or quantum dot hybrids.7 Over the past few years, graphene–semiconductor has drawn intense attention for scientific investigation because of their remarkable electronic, magnetic, optical, catalytic, and mechanical properties.8–10
Group V–VI binary compounds are highly anisotropic semiconducting materials with infinite atom chains or layers in their orthorhombic crystal structure. Antimony sulfide (Sb2S3), a member of the V–VI group metal chalcogenides (A2VB3VI, A = As, Sb, Bi; B = S, Se, Te), possesses good photosensitivity and high thermoelectric power, and it is regarded as a promising material for solar energy conversion due to its band gap covering the range of the solar spectrum.11 Up to now, research on the synthesis and morphology control of Sb2S3 has received considerable interest. There are various methodologies developed to synthesize Sb2S3, including vacuum evaporation,12,13 thermal decomposition,14 solvothermal reaction,15 microwave irradiation,16 spray pyrolysis,17 electrodeposition,18 and sonochemical method.19 Moreover, Sb2S3 with a diversity of well-defined shapes, such as rod-like,20 tube-like,21 dendrite-like,22 flower-like23 and other novel nanostructures24 have been successfully prepared. Nevertheless, how to effectively synthesize Sb2S3 crystals and control the morphology via a simple method is still a very important topic for material scientists.
Hydrazine is extensively used in the chemical, aerospace and pharmaceutical industry. However, hydrazine is a toxic material and has negative effect on health. Thus, the accurate and sensitive detection of hydrazine is of great importance. Water pollution is of tremendous public concern. Dyes, as main pollutants in industrial sewage, are harmful to the living organisms. The rapid catalytic degradation of methylene blue (MB) is fascinating from the point of pollution abatement.
Herein, we report the synthesis of Sb2S3 nanosheets on graphene (Sb2S3–G) by a facile, one-pot solvothermal method in a water–ethylene glycol mixed solvent. In the heating process, GO could be well reduced and the Sb2S3 nanosheets were formed and scattered on the graphene sheets simultaneously. The effect of graphene on the crystallization habit and catalytic properties of Sb2S3 was also investigated. It was found that Sb2S3 exhibits sheet-like structure in the presence of graphene, forming unique sheet-on-sheet hybrid nanostructures, while it tends to form sphere-like structure if graphene is absent. The introduction of graphene also brings vastly improved degradation efficiency of MB by Sb2S3. Notably, this is the first report on the use of sheet-like Sb2S3–G as catalyst for the degradation of MB. In addition, the resultant Sb2S3–G shows good electrocatalytic activity towards hydrazine oxidation. The possible mechanism for the formation of Sb2S3–G hybrid nanosheets is deduced in this paper.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Chemicals and materials
Graphite flake (natural, ∼325 mesh, 99.8%) and ethylene glycol (EG) were purchased from Alfa Aesar. L-Cysteine (HSCH2CH(NH2)CO2H, MW: 121.16) was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Antimony trichloride (SbCl3, 99.98% metals basis) and L-tartaric acid (C4H6O6, MW: 150.9) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Beijing Co., Ltd. All other chemicals were of analytical reagent grade and were used as received. Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was prepared by mixing stock solutions of NaH2PO4 and Na2HPO4 (0.1 M), and its pH adjusted with 0.1 M H3PO4 or NaOH solutions. All aqueous solutions were prepared with Milli-Q water (>18.2 MΩ) from a Milli-Q Plus system.
2.2. Synthesis of Sb2S3–G hybrid nanosheets
GO was prepared from powdered flake graphite by a modified Hummers method as described previously.25 Before starting the experiment, 0.285 g SbCl3 was dissolved in 25 mL water, which contained 1.24 g L-tartaric acid is denoted as sample A (Sb3+-tart). 0.6 g L-cysteine was dissolved in 25 mL water is denoted as sample B. In a typical preparation of the Sb2S3–G, 1 mL sample A was added into 10 mL GO aqueous dispersion (0.5 mg mL−1), followed by sonication for 30 min to form Sb3+-tart/GO. Then, 1 mL sample B was added the above solution and stirred for about 10 min, and finally, 12 mL EG was added. After the mixture was placed into a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave of 50 mL capacity, the autoclave was sealed and maintained at 180 °C for 12 h, followed by cooling to room temperature naturally. The products in the black dispersion were centrifuged (5000 rpm), and washed with water and ethanol several times. The final products dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C for 2 h to obtain Sb2S3–G (prepared in water–EG). For comparison, Sb2S3–G was prepared in water using the similar method as above, only that 12 mL EG was substituted with 12 mL water (prepared in water). For the preparation of Sb2S3–G in full EG: 0.0114 g SbCl3 and 0.0496 g L-tartaric acid were dissolved in 24 mL EG solution containing 5 mg GO. Then, 0.024 g L-cysteine was added, and the solution was treated with ultrasonication for 30 min. The resultant clear solution was transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave of 50 mL capacity and heated at 180 °C for 12 h to obtain Sb2S3–G (prepared in EG). Bare Sb2S3 was synthesized chemically in the absence of GO using a similar procedure under water–EG, i.e. 1 mL sample A was added into 10 mL water. Then, 1 mL sample B was added the above solution and stirred for about 10 min, and finally, 12 mL EG was added. The mixture was placed into a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave of 50 mL capacity. The autoclave was sealed and maintained at 180 °C for 12 h. The products were centrifuged (5000 rpm), washed with distilled water and ethanol, and dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C for 2 h to obtain Sb2S3.
2.3. Structural characterization
The structural characterization of Sb2S3–G was carried out by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) performed on a Bruker D8 Advance system by using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images were obtained by using a Hitachi H 600 electron microscope (Japan) with an accelerating voltage of 100 kV and TECNAI G 2 high-resolution transmission electron microscope (Holland) with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. Field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) images were inspected on a Hitachi field emission SEM MODEL S-4800. Energy dispersive X-ray (EDS) spectrometry was performed with a spectroscope attached to HRTEM, which was used for elemental analysis. Samples for SEM and TEM characterizations were prepared by placing a drop of prepared solution on a silicon wafer and a carbon-coated copper grid, respectively, then drying at room temperature. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurement was performed on an ESCALAB-MKII spectrometer (VG Co., United Kingdom) with Al Kα radiation as the X-ray source for excitation. Nitrogen adsorption–desorption measurement was performed on a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 system. Specific surface area was calculated by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method, and the mesopore size distribution was determined by the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method. Fourier transform infrared spectra (FTIR) were collected on a VERTEX 70 spectrometer (Bruker, Germany) over a range from 400 to 4000 cm−1. Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) detection was carried out on a Cary 500 UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer (Varian, USA). Electrochemical experiments were carried out by using a model CHI 660A electrochemical analyzer (CH Instruments, Inc., USA). A conventional three-electrode cell was used, including an Ag/AgCl (saturated KCl) electrode as the reference electrode, a platinum wire as the counter electrode and a modified glassy carbon electrode (GCE, 3 mm in diameter) as the working electrode.
2.4. Evaluation of catalytic performance of Sb2S3–G hybrid nanosheets

2.4.1. Catalytic degradation of MB. 
Typically, 10 mg Sb2S3–G was dispersed into 40 mL MB (12.5 mg L−1) aqueous solution. The degradation of MB was initiated by the addition of 10 mL H2O2 (30 wt%) at 80 °C with continuous stirring. At given time intervals, 1 mL of the mixture was withdrawn from the reaction system and quickly diluted with water to 5 mL total volume. For optical absorption measurements, the diluted solution was immediately centrifuged at 9000 rpm for 5 min to remove the suspended catalyst particles. UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded to monitor the degradation process.


2.4.2. Electro-oxidation of hydrazine. 
Prior to surface coating, the glassy carbon electrodes (GCE) was carefully polished with 1.0, 0.3, and 0.05 μm alumina powder, rinsed with water, followed by successive sonication in ethanol and water. Then, the electrode was allowed to dry under nitrogen. For electrochemistry measurements, 10 μL of Sb2S3–G (2 mg mL−1) catalyst suspension (Sb2S3–G dispersed in Nafion–ethanol solution with volume ratio of 1:9) was dropped on the surface of a GCE and dried in air.

3. Results and discussion
The Sb2S3–G hybrid nanosheets were prepared by solvothermal reaction in a water–EG mixed solvent with GO, SbCl3 and L-cysteine as source materials at 180 °C. To investigate the morphology and microstructure of the products, TEM and SEM images were obtained of the as-obtained materials. Fig. 1A and 1B show the typical TEM images of Sb2S3–G, it is seen that Sb2S3–G possesses two-dimensional (2D) nanosheets with entangled and crumpled morphology. To gain a deeper insight into the nature of graphene and Sb2S3 nanosheets, HRTEM image of the Sb2S3–G is characterized in the wrinkled area of the hybrids (Fig. 1C). We notice that there are two kinds of lattice fringes. One is not well defined with an inter-layer distance (d-spacing) of around 0.38 nm, which corresponds to the (002) plane for graphene.26 The other is ordered with a d-spacing of 0.28 nm, consistent with the (221) plane of the orthorhombic structured Sb2S3.27 The chemical composition of the Sb2S3–G was determined by the EDS (Fig. 1D), and it clearly confirms the presence of C, O, S and Sb elements (other peaks originate from the substrate used). The selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (inset in Fig. 1D) shows a distinguishable ring-like feature, indicating that the obtained Sb2S3 have polycrystalline structures.28

The elemental mapping images obtained by high-angle annular dark-field SEM (HAADF-STEM) further verified that the hybrid nanosheets is composed of C, O, S and Sb, and the compositional distributions of both the elements (S and Sb) are uniform (Fig. 2). The SEM images uncover the Sb2S3–G assemblies of interconnected and wrinkled sheets; moreover, the porous feature can be observed (Fig. 3A and 3B). In order to demonstrate the porous structure of the products, nitrogen sorption measurements were carried out to estimate the properties. As shown from the nitrogen adsorption and desorption cyclic curves in Fig. 3C, Sb2S3–G shows a typical type IV isotherm with a clear H4-type hysteresis loop, which is characteristic for narrow slit materials.29 It is noticeable that the type of hysteresis loop clearly resembles the hysteresis observed for an ordered layer-to-layer structure. In fact, the BET surface area of Sb2S3–G was calculated to be 22.614 m2 g−1, and the pore size distribution analysis indicates that the nanomaterials have pores about 3.809 nm in size (inset in Fig. 3C).

To obtain the structural information of GO and Sb2S3–G, XRD characterization was conducted (Fig. 4A). GO has a strong peak at 2θ = 11.4°, which is a feature diffraction peak of exfoliated GO.30 For Sb2S3–G, all the diffraction peaks are readily indexed to an orthorhombic phase of Sb2S3 (JCPDS file 42-1393) and no characteristic peaks are observed for other impurities, such as antimony oxides, indicating the formation of pure Sb2S3 with high crystallinity. The reduction progress of GO to G was monitored by UV-vis spectroscopy (Fig. 4B). The GO solution shows a maximum absorption peak centered at 228 nm and a shoulder peak at about 300 nm. After the chemical reduction of GO to G, the peak centered at 228 nm gradually red-shifted to 270 nm, and the shoulder peak at about 300 nm disappeared as a result of the elimination of carbonyl groups.31 FTIR spectra were measured to characterize the GO and Sb2S3–G (Fig. 4C). For GO, the spectrum exhibited the characteristic peaks of O–H (νO–H at 3428 cm−1), CO (νCO at 1726 cm−1), CC (νCC at 1619 cm−1) and C–O (νC–O at 1059 cm−1). In the obtained Sb2S3–G, the representative absorption bands of GO disappeared after solvothermal reaction. The observed band at ∼1566 cm−1 can be attributed to the skeletal vibration of CC in graphene sheets, confirming the recovery of the sp2 hybrid carbon skeleton.32 This further suggests that GO had been reduced to G, which is consistent with the UV-vis spectra results. The reduction of the GO was investigated by Raman spectra in Fig. 4D. Both GO and Sb2S3–G exhibit two bands at 1351 and 1593 cm−1, which are associated with the disordered (D) and graphitic (G) bands of carbon-based materials, respectively. Compared with GO, Sb2S3–G shows an increased D-to-G intensity ratio, which is caused by the decrease of the average size of the sp2 domains, while the quantity of these domains is increased.33 The change in D/G intensity generally indicates the reduction of GO to G.

Important information on the surface electronic state and the compositions of Sb2S3–G can be provided by XPS. The main elements C and O are found in GO and Sb2S3–G. Apart from these two kinds of elements, the elements of S (S 2s, S 2p) and Sb (Sb 3p, Sb 3d and Sb 4d) are also found in Sb2S3–G nanosheets (Fig. 5A). Since the position of the Sb 3d binding energy is superposed with that of the O 1s binding energy, the high-resolution XPS of Sb 3d was taken to identify antimony chemical states (Fig. S1A, ESI†). The two peaks at 528.5 eV and 538.1 eV correspond to the Sb 3d5/2 and 3d3/2, respectively, which confirmed the presence of Sb3+. The high-resolution spectra of S 2p show two peaks for S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2 at 160.5 eV and 161.7 eV that were attributed to a single doublet from S–Sb bonds (Fig. S1B†). All of the observed binding energy values for Sb 3d and S 2p coincide with the reported data of Sb2S3.34,35 The C 1s spectrum provided evidence for the removal of the oxygen groups and the formation of G (Fig. 5B). The C 1s spectra of GO and Sb2S3–G could be deconvoluted into three peaks at 284.7, 287.4 and 288.6 eV, which are associated with C–C, C–O (epoxy and hydroxyl), and CO (carbonyl), respectively. It is seen that the peak intensity of C–O in Sb2S3–G tremendously decreases compared with GO, suggesting that most of the oxygen-containing functional groups are successfully removed.36

All of the above results proved that Sb2S3–G hybrid nanosheets have been formed by this one-pot solvothermal route. For the sake of understanding the influence of graphene, bare Sb2S3 was also prepared under the same conditions as those for Sb2S3–G prepared in water–EG, except that GO was not added in the precursors. Interestingly, bare Sb2S3 exhibits a sphere-like structure, while Sb2S3 growth on graphene exhibits a sheet-like structure (Fig. 6). It is obvious that graphene plays a critical role in changing the crystallization habit of Sb2S3. The TEM image, high-magnification SEM image and XRD pattern of bare Sb2S3 clearly showed the formation of spherical shape with a size of 2–3 μm (Fig. 7).

In order to reveal the confinement grown Sb2S3 nanosheets on G during the solvothermal process, control experiments were performed by varying synthesis parameters, and the results are shown in ESI (Fig. S2–S4†). When the solvent was water (Fig. S2A and S2B†) or water–EG (Fig. S2C and S2D†), Sb2S3–G nanosheets were obtained. Compared with the mixed solvent of water–EG, water alone cannot lead to high-quality ultrathin Sb2S3 anchored on G with uniform sheet-like morphology, because the EG could influence the solubility, reactivity, and diffusion behavior of the reagents and the intermediate.37 When the solvent was full EG (Fig. S2E and S2F†), only irregularly shaped particles of Sb2S3 were found in the graphene, suggesting the necessity of water in the formation of Sb2S3–G hybrid nanosheets.38 However, bare Sb2S3 with well-defined and sphere-like structure could be obtained when the solvent was water–EG (Fig. S3†). The above experiments clearly indicate that both water and EG are indispensable for the formation of Sb2S3–G nanosheets and Sb2S3 spheres. Another control experiment was also conducted, in which L-cysteine was replaced by Na2S. It can be seen that the morphology of Sb2S3–G does not change (Fig. S4†), demonstrating that the growth of Sb2S3 nanosheets instead of microspheres was ascribed to the confining effect of graphene sheets.39,40L-Cysteine is an amino acid that contains three functional groups (–SH, –NH2, and –COO−) and has a high affinity for metal ions, and it plays the triple role of reducing agent, sulfur donor, and the linker in our system.41
A possible formation mechanism of the sheet-on-sheet structure of Sb2S3–G is proposed and schematically illustrated in Fig. 8. At first, Sb3+-tart ions are uniformly attached onto the GO sheets by electrostatic force due to the negatively charged nature of GO (contains hydroxyl, epoxy and carboxylic acid anchoring groups on the basal plane and edges) in the water–EG solution.42 Then, L-cysteine was added, which can release H2S during the solvothermal process; moreover, it acts as a sulfide source.41 After 12 h of reaction, nucleation and growth, the Sb2S3 nanosheets were formed and GO was reduced at the same time. The successful formation of Sb2S3 nanosheets relies on the use of GO. The functional groups on GO can help stabilize the 2D Sb2S3 nanosheets on the graphene surface. Simultaneously, GO acts as a structure-and/or morphology-directing agent for generating novel materials incorporating Sb2S3 nanosheets and G.43 In contrast, without the involvement of GO, only Sb2S3 spheres are obtained. In addition, the density of the Sb2S3 nanosheets on the surface of G can be easily changed by changing the weight ratio between GO and SbCl3 (Fig. S5†). The reaction routes for the synthesis of Sb2S3–G hybrid nanosheets can be expressed as follows:Sb3+ + tart → Sb3+-tart + GO → Sb3+-tart/GOHSCH2CH(NH2)COOH → –CH2CH(NH2)COO– + 2H2+ + S2−2Sb3+-tart/GO + 3S2− → Sb2S3–G + 2tart

4. Application
As an example of application for such Sb2S3–G, the degradation of MB, a representative organic dyestuff, was chosen to evaluate the catalytic performance. UV-vis spectroscopy was applied to monitor MB degradation process in the presence of H2O2 at 80 °C. The degradation efficiency of the MB molecules was calculated by (I0 − I)/I0 (where I0 is the absorbance at 665 nm at t = 0 and I is the absorbance at the same wavelength at a given reaction time). Fig. 9A shows the plot of degradation versus reaction time that had been translated from the UV-vis profiles of the catalysts on the degradation of MB. The degradation efficiency of the Sb2S3–G was 98% after 20 min, which was more effective than the pure Sb2S3 spheres or G only. However, no obvious decolorization was observed without Sb2S3–G or H2O2 under the same conditions. The results indicate that both H2O2 and the catalyst are required for the degradation experiments. Fig. 9B is the typical time-dependent UV-vis curves on the degradation of MB by Sb2S3–G hybrid nanosheets. It is seen that the initial spectrum of MB shows four absorption peaks (245, 292, 614, and 664 nm), which originate from the molecular absorption of MB.44 Once H2O2 and Sb2S3–G were added, the color of the MB solution turned from blue to gray quickly and the intensity of absorption peaks decreased and finally disappeared within only 20 minutes, indicating the complete decomposition of MB. The enhanced catalytic activity of Sb2S3–G is due to the synergistic effect between Sb2S3 and G. In this process, MB is more easily absorbed on the surface of the Sb2S3–G, due to the π–π stacking interactions between π-rich MB and aromatic regions of the G, followed by the Sb2S3 nanosheets decomposition of H2O2 to form a certain amount of OH˙. These OH˙ radical species oxidize MB into CO2, H2O and other mineralization through a series of redox reactions.45,46

To explore the sensing application of the Sb2S3–G hybrid nanosheets, we fabricated a hydrazine sensor by direct deposition of the Sb2S3–G on a bare GCE surface. The electrocatalytic oxidation of hydrazine was studied using cyclic voltammetry in 0.1 M PBS at pH 6.5. Fig. 10A is the cyclic voltammogram (CV) for bare GCE, Nafion-modified GCE (Nafion/GCE), G-modified GCE (G/GCE), Sb2S3-modified GCE (Sb2S3/GCE) and Sb2S3–G-modified GCE (Sb2S3–G/GCE) toward the oxidation of hydrazine in the presence of 12 mM hydrazine. It could be seen that both bare GCE and Nafion/GCE electrodes show a weak electrocatalytic oxidation current toward hydrazine. The oxidation of hydrazine starts at about +0.5 V at these two electrodes. The oxidation current of G/GCE on hydrazine is slightly larger than the bare GCE and Nafion/GCE. In contrast, an obvious oxidation peak of hydrazine is observed at Sb2S3/GCE and Sb2S3–G/GCE, respectively. However, for the Sb2S3–G/GCE, higher current response with peak potential of +0.4 V was obtained, which is negatively shifted by 100 mV compared with the Sb2S3/GCE. Fig. 10B shows a typical current-time curve for the stepwise injection of hydrazine into 0.1 M PBS with the Sb2S3–G/GCE at a constant potential of +0.4 V. It was observed that for each addition of hydrazine, apparent current staircase was achieved and the response was very fast to reach dynamic equilibrium. The linear relationship between the catalytic current and hydrazine concentration is shown in inset of Fig. 10B. As can be seen, the modified electrode displays good linear responses ranging from 1 to 46 μM (sensitivity: 7.3 μA mM−1) and 46 to 176 μM (sensitivity: 3.1 μA mM−1). The experimental detection limit was 0.1 μM with a signal-to-noise ratio of 3. The relative standard deviation (RSD) for ten successive determinations of hydrazine was 4.5%, indicating the good reproducibility of the Sb2S3–G/GCE. The stability of the sensor was also tested by measuring response currents of the electrode. After five days, only 5.3% signal of current was lost, revealing good stability for hydrazine detection. The interference effect of some common compounds in the environmental system on the determination of hydrazine was investigated. At least 100-fold higher concentration of common ions, such as Cu2+, Fe3+, Zn2+, Ca2+, Na+, K+, NH4+, NO3–, SO42– and Cl– almost do not interfere the current response of 10 μM hydrazine.

5. Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated the synthesis of Sb2S3–G hybrid nanosheets via a simple solvothermal approach, in which the ultrathin Sb2S3 nanosheets were uniformly grown on graphene sheets. The introduction of graphene changes the crystallization habit of Sb2S3 from microspheres to nanosheets possibly due to the solvents properties and the confining effect of graphene. To investigate the catalytic performance of the products, the obtained Sb2S3–G nanosheets were used to degrade MB in the presence H2O2. Moreover, these Sb2S3–G nanosheets exhibit good electrocatalytic activity toward hydrazine oxidation. The enhanced catalytic properties are attributed to the synergism of superior conductivity of graphene and the 2D nanostructures of Sb2S3. Strategies for combining semiconductors and nanoscale building blocks into integrated nanostructures will open new opportunities for designing and synthesizing multifunctional nanocomposite materials.
