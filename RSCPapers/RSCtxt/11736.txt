    , Accepted 20th September 2011First published on 11th October 2011AbstractWe describe the application of 3-dimensional metal grid electrodes (3D-MGEs) as electron collectors in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) as a replacement for fluorinated tin oxide (FTO) electrodes. Requirements, structure, advantages, and limitations of the metal grid electrodes are discussed. Solar conversion efficiencies of 6.2% have been achieved in 3D-MGE based solar cells, comparable to that fabricated on FTO (7.1%). The charge transport properties and collection efficiencies in these novel solar cells have been studied using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy.
Introduction
A dye-sensitized solar cell (DSC) first developed by Grätzel and O'Regan1 is interesting due to its potential for achieving a low cost and highly efficient energy harnessing device.2 Much of the research in DSCs has focused on synthesis of new dyes, new electrolytes, photoanodes, and counter electrodes.3–7 A conventional DSC utilizes transparent conducting oxides (TCO) such as fluorinated tin oxide (FTO) coated on various substrates as the charge collecting electrodes. The disadvantages of the TCO layer as a charge collector include its relatively high sheet resistivity which becomes significant for large scale devices.8 Sheet resistance of an FTO coated glass is usually around 8 ohms per sq or larger, compared to that of the metal film which is usually below 1 ohms per sq. Research into alternatives for TCO has focused on the deposition of carbon based materials such as carbon nanotube networks and graphene. However sheet resistance still continues to be a limitation.9 Recently, efforts have been made to replace TCO with a metal mesh, which acts as the electron collector.10,11 The highest DSC efficiency achieved utilizing these TCO alternatives is close to 5.5%. However, studies pertaining to adjusting the geometry of these electrodes and their effect on device efficiencies have not been reported.
In this article, we report the replacement of TCO layers as electron collectors in DSCs by a lithographically patterned metal grid electrode. This method has been employed previously in other applications such as organic photovoltaics12–14 and light emitting diodes.15,16 However, it is especially interesting in DSC applications, since the excellent electron diffusion length in TiO2 photoanodes permits the utilization of undemanding lithography capability. The use of lithography allows a rational control over the geometry of the electrode. DSCs fabricated using this metal grid electrode (3D-MGE) achieved efficiencies of 6.2%, comparable to that of a standard DSC fabricated on an FTO electrode (7.1%). We believe that the simple adjustable geometry of the electrode as well as the versatility of the patterning technique allows good control over the properties of the electrode, which in turn permits the study of its effect on device efficiency. In this study, we have studied the effect of grid spacing on the solar efficiency as well as performed electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements on the electrodes to correlate the electrical parameters with the physical structure of the 3D-MGE cells.
Experimental section
Fabrication of metal grid electrode
On a borosilicate glass substrate (Schott 1650), a very thin adhesion promoter layer (HMDS primer) is first spin-coated, followed by a 6 μm thick photoresist (AZ9260, Microchem). Lithography is done using Karl Suss Mask Aligner MJB4 and lift-off mask. Titanium metal is deposited on top of this substrate by e-beam evaporation to form a 1 μm thick film.

DSC
assembly

The 3D-MGE DSC assembly process is similar to that of a standard DSC reported elsewhere.17 The fabricated 3D-MGE is treated with 40 mM TiCl4 solution. A 10 μm thick mesoporous nanoparticle TiO2 (Dye-sol 18NRT) is screen-printed directly on the 3D-MGE. No scattering layer is employed throughout the study. Post TiCl4 treatment is done before dipping in 0.3 mM N719 dye for 12 hours. The electrolyte used in this experiment is E008 (MPN based, 0.1 M iodine, 1 M PMII, 0.5 M NMB, 0.1 M LiTFSI).
Device characterization

Electron microscopy imaging of the sample is done by using JEOL FESEM–JSM7600F. J–V characterization is done using a solar simulator (Newport 91190A; AM 1.5) and a Keithley 2440 sourcemeter. Light intensity calibration is done with an Oriel reference cell. Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy is performed using Autolab PGSTAT302N with FRA2 module.
Results and discussion
Structure of cells and J–V characteristics

Fig. 1a shows the graphical representation of the metal grid. The collector grid is made of titanium, which is patterned to form lines of 6 μm width and 1 μm thickness. The spacing between the metal lines has been varied between 10 μm to 60 μm. The design also includes bridges, which connect adjacent lines to ensure fault tolerance due to redundant conduction paths within the electrode. The dimensions of a 6 μm line width, 40 μm line spacing and 1 μm height provide a sufficient collection of generated electrons while maintaining a transparency level of around 80%. Fig. 1b shows how the generated electrons are collected by the grid electrode, with the complete surface area of grid acting as an electron collector. Fig 1c shows the SEM image of the fabricated grid electrode. Inset clearly shows the fabricated grid structure with 6 μm line width and 40 μm line spacing.

(b) Structure of the 3D metal grid electrode (3DMGE) with 6 μm grid width, 1 μm grid thickness, and 40 μm spacing between grids (not drawn to scale). This 3DMGE is deposited on top of a plain glass substrate. Photogenerated electrons are collected by the nearest surface of the metal grid. (c) SEM images of the as-fabricated 3DMGE (see ESI†, Fig. S1 for SEM image of the TiO2 layer conforming around the metal grid). Inset shows dimension of the grid under 800× magnifications. 
The use of titanium metal as the grid material was motivated by its suitable work function, good sheet resistance, and its stability to the electrolyte. The deposited titanium layer has a work function of 4.23 eV (measured by Kelvin Probe) and forms a good ohmic contact with the conduction band of the TiO2 layer (4.2 eV).18 Four-point probe measurements reveal that the as-deposited titanium layer has a sheet resistance of around 1.2 Ω per sq, compared to 13 Ω per sq measured on the TEC-15 FTO used for fabricating control devices (ESI†, Table S1). Although covered by the mesoporous titania layer, there exists a possibility of contact between the grid electrode and the iodine/tri-iodide redox electrolyte, which has been found to be corrosive in nature.19,20 The inertness of titanium grid to the attack by the electrolyte21 can be enhanced by forming a thin oxide layer on the metal by heating the electrode to 500 °C. Another consequence of the heat treatment is a reduction of the dark currents of the electrode at higher potentials (see ESI†, Fig. S2).

Fig. 2 shows the J–V characteristics of a standard DSC and a 40 μm 3D-MGE DSC. Efficiency of the standard cell is 7.1%, with an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 735 mV, a short circuit current (Jsc) of 13.3 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 72.6%. On the other hand, efficiency of the 40 μm 3D-MGE cell is 6.2%, with Voc of 718 mV, Jsc of 11.7 mA cm−2, and FF of 73.5%. The inset of Fig. 2 shows the dependence of the efficiency on different line spacing (see ESI†, Fig. S3 for J–V characteristics). The efficiency and Jsc increase as we increase the line spacing until 40 μm. We attribute the increase in efficiency and Jsc to the improvement in transparency (transparency of electrode with 10, 20, 40 and 60 μm spacing are 44.19%, 57.86%, 74.02% and 79.44%, respectively, as measured by a UV-Vis spectrometer; see ESI†, Fig. S4). Although the transparency of 60 μm spaced grids is still higher than the 40 μm spaced one, Jsc reduces possibly because of electron collection losses due to a longer electron transport path. Additional measurements on similar MGE devices which compensated for the differences in transparency (either through normalization or through counter electrode illumination) revealed that devices with shorter electron transport distance had higher normalized JSC values (please refer to ESI†, Tables S2 and S3 for details).

The design of the structure, size, and spacing of the 3D-MGE DSC is dependent on the transparency and electron diffusion length (EDL) of the system. The spacing between the metal lines should not be significantly greater than the EDL, such that collection efficiency does not suffer significantly. The height of the metal grids should be higher than or equal to the thickness of semiconductor layer less the EDL, so that electrons generated at the outer edge of the photoanode can still be collected efficiently. The height of the grid electrodes is more critical in systems with low EDL; when EDL is longer than the semiconductor film thickness, the only role of the grid height is to ensure low electrode resistance. Although the width of the metal grids can be reduced to improve the transparency, it is normally limited by the resolution limits of the patterning system.
To study the electron transport property in 3D-MGE integrated DSCs, we compare their electrical properties to those of the standard DSCviaEIS analysis.

EIS characterization
We measured the EIS of both the standard cell and the 40 μm 3D-MGE cell at open circuit potential. We employ the standard general transmission line model to fit the curve and interpret the data.22 The extracted parameters of the model include Rt, Rct and Cμ. Rt refers to the electron transport resistance in the mesoporous TiO2 layer. Rct is the charge transfer resistance at the TiO2 layer and the electrolyte interface. Cμ is the chemical capacitance of the TiO2 film and electrolyte. Ln is the electron diffusion length of the system.

Fig. 3 shows the fitted EIS parameters obtained for both the standard cell as well as the 40 μm 3D-MGE cell. As both these cells are made from the same materials following identical fabrication processes, we expect a similar Rct (charge transfer resistance) and Cμ (chemical capacitance) curves. However, Fig. 3a shows that Rct of the 40 μm 3D-MGE cell is slightly higher than that of the standard cell. We speculate that this may be due to the reduced area of the conducting substrate exposed to the electrolyte. Fig. 3b shows that the measured Cμ is quite identical in both the 40 μm 3D-MGE cell and the standard cell, which is in agreement with our earlier expectation. Fig. 3c shows that Rt of the 40 μm 3D-MGE cell is almost 1 order higher in magnitude compared to that of the standard cell at the same operating potential. Consequently, since electron diffusion length is calculated with much higher Rt, constant thickness d of 10 μm, and a very similar Rct value, the Ln of 40 μm 3D-MGE cell (red curve in Fig. 3d) is calculated to be much lower than that of the standard cell (black curve in Fig. 3d).
 Fig. 3  (a) Charge transfer resistance (Rct) vs. voltage curve; a slight shift is observed. (b) Chemical capacitance (Cμ) vs. voltage curve. (c) Transport resistance (Rt) vs. voltage curve, a few data points at higher voltages have been omitted due to the reliability issue. We can clearly see that at any given voltage, the Rt of MGE cell is always higher than that of the standard cell. (d) Electron diffusion length (Ln) vs. voltage curve. It is interesting to note that the calculated Ln of both cells is very close to each other after we take into account the effective thickness. 
Interestingly, if we adjust the d to reflect the effective distance the electrons have to be transported in this 40 μm 3D-MGE cell (approximately 20 μm), the Ln curve (blue curve in Fig. 3d) is brought very much closer to that of the standard cell. It is also noteworthy that at the maximum power point, Ln of the 40 μm MGE is calculated to be approximately 60 μm. This value is about 6 times larger than the TiO2 film thickness and 3 times larger than the electron transport distance in this MGE cell, which indicates its efficient charge collection. This implies that the charge transport behaviour in the photoanode is similar irrespective of the underlying electrode.
When employing the 3D-MGE, the electrons in the TiO2 photoanode can be collected both vertically and horizontally. As described previously, for electrons predominantly generated at the top of the photoanode, the distance to the top surface of the grid electrode serves as the shortest electron collection path. In contrast, for electrons generated midway between two adjacent metal lines, the shortest electron path is close to 20 μm. This could contribute to the higher Rt values measured in the 40 μm 3D-MGE cell as compared to that of the standard cell. This increase in the electron path with increasing grid spacing will eventually limit charge collection efficiencies for larger grid spacing despite the improvements in transparency.
The observation and analysis of Rt, Rct, Cμ and Ln indicate that the charge transport characteristics of the TiO2 photoanode are not significantly affected by the presence of the 3D-MGE below. Further development involving the patterning of narrower metal grid electrodes will improve the overall device transparency and hence its efficiency. Moreover, it is possible to lower down the total cost of DSC production by a careful and suitable modification to the metal electrode fabrication, for example, viamicro-contact printing or transfer printing techniques.
Conclusions
This work demonstrates the application of patterned metal grid electrodes for electron collection in DSCs, replacing FTO. An efficiency of 6.2% has been achieved on the 3-dimensional metal grid electrode based DSC with 6 μm width, 1 μm height and 40 μm spacing between grids. The control sample made of the same materials, fabricated on the standard FTO glass, has an efficiency of 7.1%. Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy characterization on the 3D-MGE DSC revealed that the FTO can be replaced by this approach without significant change in the charge transport within the photoanode. The charge collection efficiency of the 3D-MGE is dependent on the electron diffusion length and hence the grid spacing. This work provides a basis for further development in improving the device efficiency as well as lowering total cost via the application of metal grid electrodes.
