    , Accepted 26th July 2017First published on 26th July 2017AbstractIt has been a strong desire for researchers to control material growth at the molecular and atomic levels. Molecular and atomic layer deposition (MLD and ALD) are two such techniques. In comparison to a huge amount of studies invested on ALD, the research on MLD is still relatively limited due to the difficulty in finding suitable coupling precursors, but the recently successful applications of MLD are very encouraging in many areas such as surface engineering, new energies, and catalysis. In order to further stimulate more research enthusiasm and educate beginners, we contribute this thorough survey on the progress of MLD. This review is a comprehensive account of MLD processes for organic and organic–inorganic materials, covering precursors, surface chemistry, growth characteristics, film properties, and promising applications. The work provides a complete summary of over 80 MLD processes for growing over 20 types of pure polymeric and metal-based hybrid polymeric materials. Given their similarities in mechanisms, we made a comparative description between ALD and MLD, and discussed the uncountable possibilities to combine both ALD and MLD for advanced materials with desirable properties. To feature and highlight the significance of MLD, this review specially gives some detailed discussions on MLD's applications in several important areas, including novel nanostructured materials, surface engineering, new energies (i.e., batteries, supercapacitors, solar cells, and water splitting), catalysis, and rewritable data storage. With this work, we expect to boost research interest and attempts at advanced materials using MLD as well as ALD.Xiangbo MengDr Xiangbo (Henry) Meng is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at the University of Arkansas (Fayetteville, AR).

1. Introduction
Nanoscience and nanotechnology hold great promise in providing solutions for the four big problems1,2 facing our modern society: food,3–5 health,6 energy,7 and pollution.8 With increasing research enthusiasm and effort in nanoscale materials, it is critical to fulfil miniaturization. To this end, there have been two technical strategies in practice: the top-down and bottom-up approaches.1,9,10 However, it is becoming increasingly apparent that the top-down approach is subject to drastic limitations for dimensions smaller than 100 nm.1,11 In comparison, the bottom-up approach (credited to Feynman12) as an alternative strategy allows the manipulation of atoms and molecules for building up nanostructures, and opens virtually unlimited possibilities concerning design and construction of artificial molecular-level devices and machines.10,11 On the other hand, such an approach can give invaluable contributions to better understanding the molecular-level aspects of the extremely complicated devices and machines.11 It has been a strong desire for scientists and engineers to manipulate atoms and molecules precisely at will to build ideal nanosized materials for various applications.13 The control of atomic and molecular scale manufacturing is a need for the development of new technologies that will enable working at the nanoscale in a reliable and reproducible manner, constituting the basis for future production processes.10 Among all the methods in the bottom-up strategic category to date, in the past decades two techniques named atomic layer deposition (ALD)14 and molecular layer deposition (MLD)15 have emerged and have been attracting more and more research attention with their unique capabilities in nanofabrication. Both ALD and MLD well meet our desires for precisely controlling material growth at the atomic and molecular levels with high reproducibility.
ALD is a vapor-phase surface-controlled thin film technique based on alternative self-terminating surface reactions.14 It proceeds in a layer-by-layer growth mode and enables material growth controlled at the atomic level. ALD first appeared in the 1970's and was initially invented by Suntola16 for growing ZnS two-dimensional (2D) planar thin films for electroluminescent display panels. ALD experienced some evolutions in its earlier times and its applications were very limited until the 21st century.17,18 In the early 2000's, ALD appeared as an enabling technology in microelectronics manufacturing, particularly for depositing high-k oxides.19 At the same time, ALD's potentials for various nanostructures have also been recognized and this has made it a powerful tool to date for synthesizing nanoscale materials.20,21 Since then, ALD has been widening its applications through offering new solutions with novel nanostructured materials. To this end, many excellent reviews have been documented in the literature for microelectronics,22–25 energies (e.g., photovoltaics,26,27 catalysis,28 fuel cells,27,29 batteries,27,30–34 supercapacitors,31 water splitting,35 and optoelectronics19,27), medical treatment,36 environmental issues,37 surface engineering,21 and novel nanodevices.38 Recently ALD has accomplished many new successes such as ultralight and ultrastiff mechanical metamaterials39 and superior two-dimensional materials.40,41 As clearly indicated by its name, ALD itself enables material growth at the atomic level.14 With this nature, ALD has been to date exclusively used for synthesizing inorganic materials,42,43 covering single elements,23,44 binary compounds (e.g., oxides,19 sulfides,45 nitrides,23 and fluorides46), ternary and even more complex compounds.47–55 In the meanwhile, a large number of novel nanostructures have been developed by ALD from zero-dimensional (0D) to 1D, 2D, and 3D morphologies.21,56 The strong versatility of ALD accounts for the huge number of publications since its delivery (illustrated in Fig. 1a), especially since the beginning of the 21st century.

Analogous to ALD, MLD as the sister technique was first coined in 1991 by Yoshimura and co-workers57 exclusively for nanoscale films of organic materials, especially pure polymers and metal-based hybrid polymers.15,58–61 This unique controllable process was first demonstrated for synthesizing polyimides.57 In following research efforts, there are more polymeric films developed, including polyazomethines,62–65 polyureas,66–70 polyamides,71–74 poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene),75,76 polyimide–polyamides,77 polythioureas,78 polyethylene terephthalate,79 and the others.80,81 Very inspiringly, in 2008 George's group initiated the studies on metal-based hybrid polymers,82 showing many interesting properties. The first reported such films are an aluminum alkoxide (the so-called “alucone”),82 and thereafter there are many more alucones59,83–91 developed by MLD. These also ignited research interests in other metalcones (e.g., mangancone,91 zincones,92–99 zircones,100,101 titanicones,102–105 hafnicones,106 and vanadicone107) and other metal-based polymers.108–111 This greatly extended our capabilities in searching for advanced materials in a controllable mode. Given the fact that polymers are composed of multiple repeating units, their growth can only be controlled at the molecular level. Since its delivery, MLD compared to ALD is still in its infancy to date and there are only over 100 research papers totally recorded in the literature (see Fig. 1b). In the past few years, new efforts in MLD processes have also produced many promising hybrid materials such as metal–organic frameworks (MOFs),112–114 lithium terephthalates,115 metal tetracyanoethylenes,116,117 and metal quinolones.118,119 Owing to its unlimited possibilities for new polymers and hybrid materials with precisely controllable growth, MLD thus is drawing an ever-increasing interest. In fact, MLD has laid a new venue for developing new organic and organic–inorganic materials to address many technical challenges in a large variety of applications such as microelectronics,120 catalysis,121 energy conversion and storage,122 organic magnets,120 luminescent devices,60 surface engineering,123,124 and many others.61
Due to the differences in their bonding and elemental composition, inorganic and organic materials exhibit very distinct properties. In many cases, inorganic and organic matters are often complementary in properties. Through combining the ALD and MLD processes, more interestingly, there are new hybrid organic–inorganic materials developed with amazing properties. It is very favorable that the complementary ALD and MLD share many common characteristics in film growth, such as the chemistry based on surface-controlled reactions, conformal film coverage over high-aspect-ratio substrates, low growth temperatures, and high flexibility for large varieties of materials. To date, there are many excellent reviews14,27,30,32,34,38,42,45 for summarizing ALD's mechanism, capabilities, and applications. In comparison, there are also about ten summaries of MLD reported in the literature.15,58–61,118,120,122,123,125 However, these reviews of MLD have either been published in a much earlier time or only focused on introducing a special feature of MLD. In particular, in recent years there have been an increasing number of studies on MLD (see Fig. 1b). In this context, it is time for an updated account of MLD processes for clarifying their surface chemistries, growth characteristics, film properties, and potentials for applications. Along with the needs for advanced materials with unusual properties, in addition, there is a new trend to bridge ALD with MLD for advanced hybrid organic–inorganic materials. Hybrid materials (a land of multidisciplinarity126 which traditionally is dominated by solution-based methods) have long been searched for new properties for many important applications.126–132 Given the afore-discussed facts, we therefore are inspired to contribute this comprehensive review, in which we make a thorough survey of various MLD processes for organic and organic–inorganic hybrid materials. Specifically, this review systematically categorizes MLD processes and clarifies their underlying growth mechanism, growth characteristics, and film properties. In addition, this work summarizes the successful applications of MLD in several important areas such as novel nanoscale functional materials, surface engineering, energy conversion and storage, and catalysis. This new summary lays stress on the possibilities of MLD and specially highlight its processes for pure polymers and metal-based hybrid polymers. In addition, this work introduces the combination of MLD with ALD for nanolaminates with tunable properties and promising applications.
This review covers seven parts. Following this introductory section, we give some fundamental knowledge on both MLD and ALD, present a concise comparison of MLD with ALD in surface chemistry and growth characteristics, and the unique characterization of MLD. The third part focuses on introducing various MLD processes for pure polymers with a full collection of all the polymers as well as their precursors reported, and detail their growth characteristics and the properties of the resultant films. The fourth section continues to introduce MLD processes for metal-based hybrid polymers, divides all hybrid materials into different classes, and describes their growth characteristics, surface chemistry, and precursor selections. In the subsequent fifth part, we specially introduce the flexibility and unlimited possibility for new hybrid materials by combining MLD with ALD. The sixth part emphasizes the recent exciting results from MLD and the combination of MLD with ALD, such as novel nanostructures, surface engineering, energy conversion and storage, and catalysis. In the last part, we give some brief conclusions, and then have some insightful outlooks on future development of MLD by itself and its integration with ALD.
2. Fundamentals of MLD
2.1. Surface chemistry
Like ALD, MLD is also a surface-controlled vapor-phase process and this well distinguishes it from all the other polymeric film techniques such as solution-based methods, and conventional chemical vapor deposition (CVD) processes. ALD features preciseness in arranging atoms for inorganic materials in a layer-by-layer mode, while MLD analogously assembles molecular fragments accurately for organic materials. Thus, there are a lot of similarities in the operations of ALD and MLD. Fig. 2a illustrates the ALD processes of binary inorganic materials, while Fig. 2b displays a MLD process using homobifunctional precursors. In terms of surface reactions, for example, the model ALD process of Al2O3 using trimethylaluminum (TMA, Al(CH3)3) and H2O can be described in the equations of (1A) and (1B) as follows:133 |–OH + Al(CH3)3 (g) → |–O–Al(CH3)2 + CH4 (g)(1A) |–O–Al(CH3)2 + 2H2O (g) → |–OAl(OH)2 + 2CH4 (g)(1B)where “|” indicates substrate surfaces while “(g)” signifies gas phases. The surface chemistry of the ALD Al2O3 is based on ligand exchanges between –OH and –CH3. In addition to the ligand exchange mechanism as illustrated in the equations of (1A) and (1B), there are other mechanisms for ALD surface chemistry as well, such as dissociation and association.42 It needs to be pointed out that the typical ALD processes have their growth rate, i.e., growth per cycle (GPC) of ∼1 Å per cycle,15 except for an exception reported by Gordon's group for a rapid ALD process of SiO2 with a GPC of 12 nm per cycle.134

During a typical MLD process using two homobifunctional precursors (see Fig. 2b), the molecules of one precursor react with surface reactive groups via the corresponding linking chemistry to add a molecular layer of the precursor on the substrate surface with new reactive sites.120 After a full purge followed, the molecules of another precursor react with the new reactive sites, leave another molecular layer of the second precursor, and recover the surface back to the initial reactive groups. Thereafter, another full purge is applied. Repeating the four steps, MLD processes can realize accurate polymeric film growth at the molecular level. Using adipoyl chloride (AC) and 1,6-hexanediamine (HD) as precursors,71,72 for example, a MLD process has been used to develop a linear growth of nylon films and the surface chemistry can be described as follows: |–NH2 + ClCO(CH2)4COCl (g) → |–NHCO(CH2)4COCl + HCl (g)(2A) |–NHCO(CH2)4COCl + H2N(CH2)6NH2 (g) → |–NHCO(CH2)4CO–NH(CH2)6NH2 + HCl (g)(2B)
The AC–HD MLD process realizes a GPC of 19 Å per cycle at 62 °C.72 Obviously, the molecular layers of –CO(CH2)4CO– and –NH(CH2)6NH– during the MLD-nylon are much larger than the atomic layers of –Al– and –O– in the ALD-Al2O3. This underlies the higher GPC of the MLD nylon process of AC–HD. So far, there have been many MLD processes reported for pure polymeric materials, including polyamides,71–74 polyimides,57,77,135–138 polyazomethines,62–65,139,140 polythioureas,78 polyureas,66–70,141–144 and some other polymers.75–77,79–81,145
In addition to fabricating pure polymeric films, MLD also enables organic–inorganic hybrid materials by adopting an ALD precursor and a MLD precursor, such as polymeric metal alkoxide materials (i.e., metalcones), in which diols can be used to replace H2O to couple with TMA. Using TMA and ethylene glycol (EG, HOCH2CH2OH, a homobifunctional diol precursor), for instance, George's group synthesized the first metal-based hybrid polymer, an aluminum alkoxide (i.e., alucone) of Al(OCH2CH2O)2 as described in the following two-step surface reactions of (3A) and (3B):82 |–OH + Al(CH3)3 (g) → |–O–Al(CH3)2 + CH4 (g)(3A) |–O–Al(CH3)2 + 2HOCH2CH2OH (g) → |–OAl(OCH2CH2OH)2 + 2CH4 (g)(3B)
Apparently, the molecular fragment of –OCH2CH2O– attached in the MLD-alucone is far much larger than the atomic part of –O– in the ALD-Al2O3. This makes the MLD film of the aluminum alkoxide grow much faster than the analog of the ALD Al2O3, accounting for a GPC of 4 Å per cycle at 85 °C for the MLD alkoxide82versus 1.3 Å per cycle for the ALD Al2O3 at 80 °C.133 Through smartly selecting precursors with the same functional groups but different backbones, very impressively, MLD enables variant polymers with different properties. Substituting EG with the aromatic hydroquinone (HQ, HOC6H4OH), for example, another alucone can be deposited and its surface reactions can be interpreted by the equations of (4A) and (4B):84 |–OH + Al(CH3)3 (g) → |–O–Al(CH3)2 + CH4 (g)(4A) |–O–Al(CH3)2 + 2HOC6H4OH (g) → |–OAl(OC6H4OH)2 + 2CH4 (g)(4B)
The use of the aromatic backbone is expected to provide structural stability and contribute largely to the electrical properties of the resultant polymer films. This TMA–HQ MLD process exhibits a GPC of 4.1 Å per cycle at 150 °C.84 Remarkably, MLD provides uncountable possibilities for new materials with tunable properties. To date, there are alucones,59,82–91,99,124,145–161 zincones,93–99,162,163 titanicones,92–99,105,162,163 vanadicones,107 zircones,100,101 hafnicones,106 mangancones,91 metal quinolones,119,164 and some other hybrid materials108–117,165–170 reported. Ascribed to the cyclic operation nature of both MLD and ALD, furthermore, the MLD-resultant organic films can be readily integrated with ALD-resultant inorganic films with any layer ratios. This leads to unlimited hybrid organic–inorganic nanolaminates with optimal properties for a large range of applications. Therefore, the integration of MLD and ALD further greatly expands our capabilities for advanced materials. We will give some special discussions on the hybrid organic–inorganic nanolaminates in some following parts.
To investigate the underlying mechanism of the many MLD processes, a suite of in situ techniques have been employed in previous studies. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR)70,82,84,87–90,155 (see Fig. 3a) and quartz crystal microbalance (QCM)82,84,85,88–90,100,102,116 (see Fig. 3b) are two widely utilized in situ instruments and very helpful to interpret surface chemistry during MLD processes. FTIR spectra can clearly identify a molecular fingerprint after each surface reaction. QCM can definitively detect any molecular deposition in mass uptake and demonstrate a linear growth for any feasible MLD process. On the other hand, quadrupole mass spectrometry (QMS)147 is also very useful to detect any byproducts resulted from MLD surface reactions. All the information from the three in situ measurements together helps construct the surface reactions during a MLD process. In this regard, several excellent reviews have been well documented.15,60,120,123 Previously, we have successfully utilized them for exploring the surface reactions of new ALD processes.171,172

2.2. Growth characteristics
The growth characteristics of ALD processes are subject to three parameters: precursor, growth temperature, and substrate, as well discussed by Puurunen.42 In MLD processes, the three elements also play important roles in organic film growth. As required in ALD processes, the precursors in MLD processes should also be able to provide a high vapor pressure, chemically stable in a temperature range for deposition, and highly reactive to their coupled precursors. As demonstrated above using EG and HQ for alucones, MLD films are highly related to the precursors adopted, such as polymeric material structures and GPCs. In some cases, substrates have to be pretreated in order to initiate a MLD process. For examples, 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES, H2N(CH2)2NH(CH2)3Si(OCH3)3) has been used in some studies to modify the Si and SiO2 substrates' surface coverage from –OH into –NH2 (ref. 67–69, 74 and 78) in order to initiate some polymeric film growths. In contrast, octadecylphosphonic acid (ODPA, H3C(CH2)17PO(OH)2) has been applied on Cu substrates to form a protective layer to resist ALD and MLD growths.142,143 As for the effects of MLD deposition temperature, the studies documented in the literature clearly show that almost all the MLD processes exhibit a decreasing tendency with temperature in GPCs. In other words, an increase in temperature commonly reduces the GPCs of MLD processes. In all the cases reported, MLD enables uniform and conformal coatings any shaped substrates (see Fig. 3c–e). The film root-mean-surface (RMS) roughness is usually in the range of 2–6 Å (ref. 79, 80, 88, 90, 98, 109, 110, 116, 138 and 173) (see Fig. 3f, showing a roughness of 5.6 Å of MLD-deposited alucone using TMA and glycidol (GLY)88). Organic and organic–inorganic hybrid films from MLD processes are often air-sensitive, and chemically and thermally unstable, but there do have some MLD processes producing stable organic and organic–inorganic hybrid films. This will be discussed in following parts.
In order to characterize the growth characteristics of MLD-resultant organic films, many tools have been employed to measure MLD film surface roughness, thickness, morphology, and composition. X-ray reflectivity (XRR)82,87,89,165 and spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE)82,89 are two techniques for measuring film thickness. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)87,90,97,105,106,147,151,162,163,174 (see Fig. 3c–e) is normally applied for verifying film thickness and structure. Atomic force microscopy (AFM)79,83,88,90,97,104,107,116 (see Fig. 3f) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM)101,112,113,173 are used for observing film surface roughness and morphology. X-ray photoelectronic spectroscopy (XPS)67,68,78,80,82,87,92 has been used for analyzing film composition. There are also other analysis instruments involved but not listed here.
3. MLD processes for organic polymers
It was in 1991 when Yoshimura et al.57 first coined “molecular layer deposition (MLD)” in their work. They described that MLD is a process57 in which molecules are stacked on substrates one by one in order of preference in a vacuum, analogous to ALD. This unique controllable process was first demonstrated for synthesizing polyimides. Dosing pyromellitic dianhydride (PMDA) and 4,4′-diaminodiphenyl ether (DDE, or 4,4′-oxydianiline, i.e., ODA) sequentially, Yoshimura et al.57 successfully demonstrated the saturated growth of the monolayers of PMDA and DDE in a layer-by-layer mode at a certain temperature. Using 2,4-diaminonitrobenzene (DNB) to replace DDE, they also verified that the coupling of PMDA and DNB can also realize a saturated growth in a controlled manner, but PMDA and DNB need different substrate temperatures (≥80 °C for PMDA and ≤50 °C for DNB). In fact, the latter case is rare in the MLD processes reported to date. In their another work,62 the team revealed that the pairing of terephthalaldehyde (TPA) and p-phenylenediamine (PPDA) are able to grow in the so-called MLD mode at room temperature (RT, i.e., 25 °C). Using PPDA and PMDA as MLD precursors, in an early study Bitzer and Richardson175 deposited an oligimide film on Si wafers at RT. In the process, PPDA was dosed at RT while the PMDA was heated to 200 °C for supplying sufficient vapors. Since these early practices, in the past two decades many more research efforts have been devoted to various pure organic films using this new MLD strategy. Now the MLD processes reported so far include polyamides from acyl chlorides and amines, polyimides from anhydrides and amines, polyazomethines from aldehydes and amines, polyurethanes from isocyanates and alcohols, polyureas from isocyanates and amines, and some others. These advances are summarized and discussed in this part. Along with the many polymeric films, a large variety of MLD precursors has been explored and they all have been classified in Fig. 4 and 5, including homobifunctional and heterofunctional precursors.

 Fig. 5  Other MLD precursors for pure polymeric films, including (a–c) homobifunctional precursors ((a) diene, (b) isocyanate, and (c) others) and (d and e) heterofunctional precursors. 
3.1. Polyimides
Aromatic polyimides (PI) are the first polymers developed by MLD,57 and their molecular structures feature the direct coupling of the aromatic rings with each other, or by introducing such interbonds as –O–, –NH–, –CO–, between aromatics.176 Aromatic polyimides have exceptional properties in heat resistance, chemical resistance, radiation resistance, and electrical insulation. Thus, they have been receiving a wide range of applications. There are five MLD processes documented in the literature, including PMDA–DDE,57,77 PMDA–DNB,57 PMDA–PPDA,175 PMDA–EDA,138 and PMDA–HD.138 The chemistries of these MLD processes are illustrated in Fig. 6a.
 Fig. 6  MLD processes of (a) polyimides and (b) polyazomethines. 
The first successful MLD process was demonstrated at RT for aromatic polyimides by Yoshimura et al., using PMDA and DDE (see Fig. 6a, PI-1).57 In the same study, Yoshimura et al. also tried to couple PMDA with DNB for another MLD process (see Fig. 6a, PI-2), but the deposition could not be realized at a constant temperature, implying an unsuccessful attempt. Miyamae et al.77 in a later study performed a curing process on the MLD-resultant PMDA–DDE layers (deposited at RT) at 150 °C for 1 hour in air. They found that the curing treatment could desorb residual monomers, and further polymerize and dehydrate the amide moiety originating from the PMDA–DDE segment into imide. Miyamae et al. also verified that the PMDA–DDE polyimide film showed excellent stability against N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF).77
Among the earlier MLD processes, the PMDA–PPDA coupling is successful for polyimides. At RT, Bitzer and Richardson175 first revealed that PPDA molecules could chemically adsorb on a clean Si(100) surface via dissociation of one of NH2 functional groups to form a Si–(NH)–C link between the Si substrate and the phenyl ring. The dissociated hydrogen atom saturated one of the dangling Si bonds. The chemisorption can be described as follows: 2|– + H2NC6H4NH2 (g) → |–HNC6H4NH2 + |–H(5)
A subsequent dosing of PMDA produced another layer over the chemisorbed PPDA. The alternative surface chemistry of the PMDA–PPDA MLD process can be described in the following reactions: |–HNC6H4NH2 + O3C2C6H2C2O3 → |–HNC6H4NH2O3C2C6H2C2O3(6A) |–O3C2C6H2C2O3 + H2NC6H4NH2 → |–O3C2C6H2C2O3H2NC6H4NH2(6B)
A curing process at 200 °C for 5 min could dehydrate the resultant PPDA–PMDA layers for improved polymerization (see Fig. 6a, PI-3).
Except for the MLD process of PMDA–DNB, Putkonen et al.138 investigated all the other aforementioned MLD processes for polyimides in the temperature range of 160–200 °C. Fig. 7 illustrates the growth of the polyimide using PMDA and EDA (see Fig. 6a, PI-4) as precursors. In the study, they revealed that at 160 °C the PMDA–HD process (see Fig. 6a, PI-5) produces the maximum GPC, 5.8 Å per cycle, followed by 4.9, 3.9, and 1.4 Å per cycle for PMDA–DDE, PMDA–EDA, and PMDA–PPDA. Increasing deposition temperature decreased the growth rates in all the cases. At 180 °C, there was no growth observed for PMDA–DDE, PMDA–EDA, and PMDA–PPDA. The PMDA–HD process generated a GPC of 1.7 Å per cycle at 190 °C but no more growth at 200 °C. Putkonen et al.138 disclosed that all the as-deposited polyimides are amorphous. Annealing was conducted for the PMDA–HD and PMDA–DDE films at 200–400 °C, but the films remained amorphous. The researchers also investigated the solubility of the as-deposited and annealed polyimides thin films in concentrated H2SO4 at 25 °C and the samples were readily soluble in H2SO4.

3.2. Polyazomethines
Polyazomethines (PAM), or Schiff bases (–NC–), are promising photovoltaic materials in organic bulk heterojunction solar cells.177 The azomethine bond is isoelectronic with its vinyl analogue. Yoshimura et al.62 first reported a MLD process for a polyazomethine, using TPA and PPDA as precursors (see Fig. 6b, PAM-1). This MLD process was later used for growing orientation-controlled molecule-by-molecule polymer wires.63–65,139,140 As illustrated in Fig. 8, the MLD process of the TPA–PPDA was conducted on an amino-alkanethiol modified Au substrate, leading to the vertical growth of the polyazomethine wires. Yoshimura et al.63–65 also developed another MLD process of polyazomethines, using oxalic dihydrazide (ODH) and TPA as precursors (see Fig. 6b, PAM-2). Furthermore, Yoshimura et al.63–65 combined the two MLD processes for polymer wires containing multiple quantum dots.

3.3. Polyureas
Polyurea (PU) is a tough, high melting elastomer and suitable for fiber applications.66 Urea is an organic compound with the linear chemical formula of H2NCONH2, having two amine groups (–NH2) joined by a carbonyl functional group (CO). Traditionally, polyureas have been synthesized via a simple step growth of addition polymerization.66 Bent et al.66 first developed a MLD process for growing a polyurea on Ge(100) in 2005, using PD and EDA as precursors (see Fig. 9, PU-1 and Fig. 10a). This MLD process could be performed at RT. The resultant polyurea films demonstrated excellent stability under atmospheric conditions and elevated temperature, showing little change in air for 2 weeks and being stable to a temperature of at least 250 °C under vacuum.67 Bent et al.67 revealed that the growth rate of the polyurea films decreased with increased temperatures, changing from 4.1 Å per cycle at room temperature to 0.4 Å per cycle at 100 °C. In addition, Bent et al.67,68 also demonstrated that the MLD route is very flexible to change the composition of polyureas through modifying precursor backbones and thus adjust the organic film properties. For example, they exemplified the substitution of EDA by 2,2′-thiobisethylamine (TBEA)67 and 2,2′-(propane-2,2-diylbis(oxy))diethanamine (PDDE)68 to couple with PD, and the new PD–TBEA (see Fig. 9, PU-2) and PD–PDDE (see Fig. 9, PU-3 and Fig. 10b) MLD process produced new polyureas with S and O functionalities incorporated, respectively. Bent et al.68 demonstrated that, through embedding acid-labile acetal groups in the backbone of PDDE, the resultant polyurea via the PD–PPDE process is labile to acid solutions but stable in base solutions. In contrast, the polyurea from the PD–EDA process is stable in acid solutions. Furthermore, Bent et al.67,68 also demonstrated the flexibility of MLD in creating blended films of PD–ED/PD–TBEA and PD–ED/PD–PDDE to form nanolaminates in a precisely controlled mode. This property-tunable characteristic makes MLD an alternative route for many applications such as lithography.68 Bent et al.141 later confirmed that PD can initiate a coupling reaction between the isocyanate functional groups and –OH groups on substrate surfaces. Therefore, the MLD process of PD–EDA can be performed directly on many more substrates.

Aimed at fabricating cross-linked organic thin films, besides the above MLD processes of polyureas, Bent et al.69 further explored several other MLD processes. Cross-linked polymers are desirable in many properties, including higher film density, better mechanical strength, and higher thermal stability. Therefore, cross-linked polymers receive a large variety of applications such as transistors, sensors, and purification membranes. In their work, Bent et al.69 demonstrated that 1,4-diisocyanatobutane (DICB) could couple with diethylenetriamine (DETA), triethylenetetramine (TETA), or tris(2-aminoethyl)amine (TAEA) for cross-linked polyurea and with EDA for non-cross-linked polyurea. They also demonstrated that the cross-linked polyureas of DICB–DETA (see Fig. 9, PU-6), DICB–TETA (see Fig. 9, PU-7), and DICB–TAEA (see Fig. 9, PU-8) have better thermal stability than the non-cross-linked DICB–EDA (see Fig. 9, PU-5).
In addition to the studies from Bent and co-workers, the latest study by Lee et al.70 developed another MLD process using PD and PPDA (see Fig. 9, PU-4) for uniformly aligned polyurea films.
3.4. Polyamides
Polyamides (PA) are one kind of important polymers with repeating units linked by amide bonds. They can occur both naturally and synthetically. Polyamides, such as proteins (wool and silk), are natural polyamides. Synthetic polyamides generally include including nylons, aramids, and polyphthalamides. They have been widely used in many industries such as textiles, automotive, carpets, and sportswear, showing high durability and strength.
The first attempt of MLD on polyamides was reported for nylon in 1997.71 Nylon is a polyamide polymer based on the reaction of an acid chloride (–COCl) with an amine (–NH2). Using adipoyl chloride (AC) and HD (see Fig. 11a, PA-1), Shao et al.71 realized a linear growth of nylon films on Si substrates at 60 °C, accounting for a growth per cycle of ∼15 Å per cycle. The Si substrates were first treated by APTES to create amino end groups of the coupling agent. George et al.72 later investigated the MLD process of AC–HD using in situ FTIR. They revealed that the MLD nylon could be deposited on SiO2 powders and the surface chemistry can be described as follows: |–NH2 + ClCO(CH2)4COCl (g) → |–NHCO(CH2)4COCl + HCl (g)(7A) |–NHCO(CH2)4COCl + H2N(CH2)6NH2 (g) → |–NHCO(CH2)4CO–NH(CH2)6NH2 + HCl (g)(7B)
 Fig. 11  MLD processes of (a) polyamides, (b) polythioureas, (c) polyethylene terephthalate, (d) BD–MC, and (e) PEDOT. 
The AC–HD MLD process exhibited a linear growth in the range of 62–157 °C, while the growth rate per cycle decreased from 19 Å per cycle at 62 °C to 3 Å per cycle at 157 °C.
In another work, George et al.73 extended their investigation to another industrially important polyamide, poly(p-phenylene terephthalamide) (PPTA) using TPC and PPDA as the MLD precursors (see Fig. 11a, PA-2). Using in situ FTIR, the researchers clarified the surface chemistry and growth rates. The surface reactions are proposed as follows: |–NH2 + ClCOC6H4COCl (g) → |–NHCOC6H4COCl + HCl (g)(8A) |–NHCOC6H4COCl + H2NC6H4NH2 (g) → |–NHCOC6H4CO–NHC6H4NH2 + HCl (g)(8B)
In multiple measurements, the surface chemistry for the PPTA MLD was consistent. However, George et al.73 particularly noticed that the growth rates of PPTA MLD were not reproducible, 1.9–4.0 Å per cycle at 145 °C and ∼0.3 Å per cycle at 180 °C. This was also observed in the nylon MLD.72 George et al.73 thus suspected that the difficulty in reproducing the MLD growth rate may be systematic for polymer MLD using bifunctional monomers. In addition, the variable PPTA MLD growth rates are significantly lower than the thickness of 12.9 Å for an ideal monolayer of the PPTA bilayer, indicating the PPTA film is not growing as expected for a full ideal monolayer. For a non-ideal growth, they hypothesized that individual polymer chains are growing that progressively lengthen as they move approximately parallel to the initial substrate, resembling a “tangled pile of spaghetti”. George et al. schematically illustrated the ideal and non-ideal growth, as shown in Fig. 12. Two reasons might have contributed to the nonideal MLD growth: (1) insufficient surface species on the substrate surface for the MLD growth and (2) MLD precursors of bifunctional monomers might have reacted with two surface species and led to “double” reactions that would eliminate active surface species and significantly reduce the MLD growth rate. To this end, George et al.73 suggested alternative precursors for addressing the shortcomings of the bifunctional monomers. According to George et al., one potential solution lies in ring-opening reactions. They explained that one such precursor has a ring formation in the gas phase but the ring will open and expose a new functionality that can react in a subsequent surface reaction, e.g., a cyclic azasilane, 2,2-dimethoxy-1,6-diaza-2-siacycloctane, and ethylene carbonate. Another possible direction suggested by George et al. is surface activation reactions. Surface activation reactions occur when a nonreacting group on the surface becomes reactive after an activation process. In this regard, George et al.73 confirmed the suggested strategies with their preliminary experiments.

Parsons et al.74 developed another MLD process using TPC and 1,4-butane diamine (BDA) (see Fig. 11a, PA-3) for alkyl-aromatic polyamide in the temperature of 75–125 °C. The surface chemistry of the TPC–BDA MLD is similar to the one described in the eqn (7A) and (7B). They disclosed that the growth rate on Si substrates decreases from ∼2 Å per cycle at 85 °C to 0.5 Å per cycle at 125 °C. At 155 °C, there was no growth observed any more. Parsons et al.74 also confirmed that pretreatment of Si substrates using APTES did not improve the growth rates, indicating that the polyamide MLD can nucleate on both the –OH and –NH2 terminated surfaces.
3.5. Conducting polymers
Since the discovery of the high electrical conductivity of polyacetylene by Shirakawa et al. in 1977,178 there have been many interesting conducting polymers developed. Among them, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) is one of the most economically significant polymers used today, featuring chemical stability, visible transparency, and high electrical conductivity.179,180 PEDOT has been produced commercially with several tons per year for electronic applications180 including organic photovoltaics, organic light emitting diodes, and electrolytic capacitor electrodes. Generally, PEDOT has been fabricated via solution-based or conventional vapor-phase methods. Recently, Parsons' group reported the first attempt to fabricate PEDOT conducting polymer films using an oxidative MLD (oMLD) process of MoCl5–EDOT (ethylene dioxythiophene) (see Fig. 11e).75 In the study, Atanasov et al.75 used MoCl5 to replace the traditional oxidants (FeCl3 and iron tosylate), owing to its higher vapor pressure, and this made the MLD process feasible to proceed at low temperatures of ≤150 °C. The MLD-PEDOT process of MoCl5–EDOT exhibits a decreasing growth tendency with temperature, from 20 Å per cycle at 100 °C to 2 Å per cycle at 150 °C.75 Using a four-point probe, Atanasov et al.75 revealed that the resultant PEDOT films show better conductivity with higher deposition temperatures. One potential reason is that the improved conductivity was ascribed to the removal of HCl at high temperature. In addition, the deposited films show very good stability in air, for there is no change in conductivity after an air exposure of 2 weeks.75 In addition, XRD diffractions uncovered that the oMLD films deposited at 100 °C have three main diffraction peaks assigned to (100), (200), and (020) of PEDOT, respectively. The peaks' positions and intensities show the polycrystalline nature of the oMLD PEDOT films at 100 °C. Different from the oMLD films at 100 °C, the oMLD films at 150 °C only show an evident peak of (020). In addition, the diffraction patterns did not change with film thickness. Furthermore, the XRD spectra show no evidence for MoOx or MoClx crystals in the films.75 The resultant PEDOT films were later demonstrated in another work as a promising cathode in dye-sensitized solar cells.76
3.6. Other polymers
Besides the main efforts discussed above for polyimides, polyazomethines, polyureas, and polyamides, there are also several studies for other polymers using MLD.
Miyamae et al.77 developed an ABC type of MLD processes using PMDA, DDE, and TPC as precursors (see Fig. 13a), which produced a polyimide–polyamide copolymer. Loscutoff et al.78 reported a new MLD chemistry based on the reaction of isothiocyanates and amines to form polythiourea films. Although structurally similar to polyureas, polythioureas significantly differ from polyureas in properties. Using 1,4-phenylene diisothiocyanate (PDITC) and EDA as precursors (see Fig. 11b), Bent et al.78 revealed that the polythiourea MLD films grew consistently with a growth rate of 1.9 Å per cycle at 50 °C. The growth rate is far lower than the theoretical 13.8 Å per cycle, indicating the growth of the molecular chains with a large angle of 82° from the surface normal, limited surface species, and/or the “double reactions” of bifunctional monomers. The PDITC–EDA chemistry of polythiourea is very similar to the PD–EDA chemistry of polyurea as illustrated in Fig. 10a. The resultant polythiourea films have a thermal stability at temperatures lower than 250 °C.
 Fig. 13  ABC MLD processes of (a) polyamide–polyimide and (b) alucone. 
Using TPC and EG (see Fig. 11c), Ivanova et al.79 studied the MLD process of polyethylene terephthalate. They disclosed that the MLD of TPC–EG behaved differently on –OH and –NH2 surfaces. The growth rate is much higher on a –NH2 surface than a –OH surface. Thus, they used APTES to pretreat Si substrates. This observation apparently conflicts with the observation of Parsons et al.74 in the MLD process of TPC–BDA. The reasons underlying this conflict are still not clear. Ivanova et al.79 then further revealed that the growth rate per cycle drops with increased temperatures from 3.3 Å per cycle at 145 °C to 1.0 Å per cycle at 175 °C. A further increase in temperature produced no film growth.
Polymers via photoinduced thiol–ene coupling MLD reactions were studied by Li et al.80 Two dienes (C8-DE and C12-DE) and five dithiols (C2-DT, C4-DT, C10-DT, BDMT, and BDT) were investigated at room temperature (see Fig. 14). Among various thiol–ene coupling combinations, Buriak et al.80 observed that longer aliphatic chains (C > 8) exhibited significant deviations from linear growth. In the case of C12-DE–C10-DT coupling, the MLD growth terminated ultimately after a few cycles. This observation is similar to the results disclosed by Adamczyk et al.73 Li et al.80 postulated and explained that the longer molecules are undergoing a self-restricting event, very similar to a looped conformation in which both thiol or ene groups within a single molecule are bonded to the underlying monolayer. This explanation is actually similar to the “double reactions” suggested by Adamczyk et al.73 Due to the looped conformation that diminishes the number of available functional groups for anchoring the next molecular layer, layer buildup ceases after two or three layers.

Efforts in MLD processes also include an attempt at polymers using MC and BD as precursors (see Fig. 11d)81 and a work on dosing APTES for modifying Si substrate surfaces.181
4. MLD processes for hybrid organic–inorganic polymers
The hybrid organic–inorganic polymers have properties that are intermediate between organic and inorganic materials. For example, the elastic modulus of ALD Al2O3 films is 195 GPa and organic polymers generally have elastic moduli in the range of 1–4 GPa. Miller et al.86 reported that the modulus of one MLD alucone film is at 37 GPa. Research in hybrid materials is relatively new and the publications to date are still limited but undoubtedly increasing quickly. Hybrid materials are very promising in a large variety of applications126,182 such as optics, electronics, mechanics, membranes, energies (e.g., batteries, photovoltaic cells, and fuel cells), catalysis, biology, medicine, surface engineering, etc. Through adopting one typical ALD metal-containing precursor (see Fig. 15) as the metal source and one MLD organic precursor (see Fig. 16 & 17), MLD processes have developed many types of organic–inorganic hybrid materials and they are discussed in the following parts.

4.1. Metalcones

4.1.1. Alucones. 
Alucones are polymeric aluminum alkoxide materials with carbon-containing backbones, i.e., ⋯Al–O–R–O–Al⋯, rather than the Al–O–Al backbone associated with alumoxanes.183 This type of polymers was first reported in solution-based methods by Schlenker in 1958.183 Using MLD, to date there have been many couples of precursors reported for growing various alucones, in which TMA is the predominant precursor as the Al source. To couple with TMA, the organic precursors include EG (2008),82 ethanolamine (EA) and maleic anhydride (MA) (2009),87 glycidol (GLY) (2011),88,89 ε-caprolactone (LAC) (2012),90 PPDA (2012),59 triethanolamine (TEA) (2013),85 lactic acid (LC) (2014),146 glycerol (GL) (2014),158 HQ (2015),84 1,4-butanediol (BDO) (2016),83 and 1,6-hexanediol (HDO) (2016).83 These organic precursors can be categorized into two classes: homobifunctional (i.e., EG, PPDA, TEA, LC, GL, HQ, BDO, and HDO) and heterobifunctional (i.e., EA and MA, GLY, and LAC) reactants (see Fig. 16 and 17). Thus, there are different growth characteristics with the different MLD couples and different properties of the resultant alucone films.
4.1.1.1. Homobifunctional organic precursors. 
In 2008 George's group reported the first attempt at using MLD to develop an hybrid organic–inorganic alucone with the precursor coupling of TMA and EG (see Fig. 18a, AC-1).82 Dameron et al.82 deposited the alucone films on Al2O3 and Si substrates, and revealed that the resultant alucone showed a temperature-dependent decreasing tendency in GPC from 4 Å per cycle at 85 °C to 0.4 Å per cycle at 175 °C. The surface reactions are suggested as follows: |–OH + Al(CH3)3 (g) → |–O–Al(CH3)2 + CH4 (g)(9A) |–O–Al(CH3)2 + 2HOCH2CH2OH (g) → |–OAl(OCH2CH2OH)2 + 2CH4 (g)(9B)
 Fig. 18  MLD processes for alucones by coupling TMA with (a) homobifunctional and (b) heterofunctional precursors. 
Based on the FTIR and QCM results, Dameron et al.82 disclosed an alternative growth mechanism for alucone MLD film. At higher temperatures (e.g., 135 °C), there are no noticeable O–H stretching vibrations observed, suggesting that the EG molecules might have reacted twice with –AlCH3 species. Thus, it was believed that, during TMA–EG deposition, TMA molecules might have diffused into the alucone polymer film in addition to reaction with –OH species. The EG molecules may then react with –AlCH3 species both on the alucone polymer surface and on TMA molecules in the alucone film. Dameron et al.82 also revealed that the resultant MLD alucone films are not stable in air, and their thickness decreased with time over the first 150 hours after their fabrication. In the meantime, the films' composition changes, due to either dehydration or dehydrogenation reactions. Dameron et al.82 further explained that the AlOx species in the films have some catalytic properties and therefore alter the films chemically. These reactions might have been initiated by H2O, for the alucone films capped by SiO2 ALD layers did not display any film shrinkage. Using TMA and EG, Liang et al.147 later deposited the alucone films on SiO2 and TiO2 nanoparticles in a fluidized bed reactor in the temperature range of 100–160 °C, and they confirmed the decreasing growth tendency with temperature. Furthermore, they disclosed that, in the alucone with the supposed form of Al(OCH2CH2O)x, x is estimated to be around 1.9 and the alucone increases slightly from 2.0 to 2.2 g cm−3 in density with temperature from 100 to 160 °C. Liang et al. further verified that the alucone coatings on the nanoparticles are very conformal, as illustrated in Fig. 3(c and d).
Structurally similar to EG, there are both BDO (see Fig. 18a, AC-2) and HDO (see Fig. 18a, AC-3) reported to couple with TMA for alucones.83 BDO and HDO have longer carbon chains than EG. Park et al.83 revealed that the longer carbon chains of the diols induces the greater flexibility of the molecular backbone, i.e., less energy is required for double reactions in the diols with longer carbon chains. As a result, it is much easier for BDO and HDO to form holes in their films, for they can react twice with the –AlCH3 surface species to create holes. In comparison, HDO is very prone to create holes while EG is relatively difficult to form holes in resultant alucone films. In addition, the longer carbon chains lead to higher GPCs. Park et al.83 also noticed the effect of temperature on the film growth. In case of EG, the molecules receive more kinetic energy at higher temperatures to overcome potential energy to react with –AlCH3 twice. Thus, the TMA–EG films are more liable to produce many holes and high surface roughness at high temperatures of >140 °C.
HQ is a homobifunctional diol reported to substitute EG for growing alucones by coupling with TMA.84 Different from EG, HQ has a rigid structure related to its aromaticity. The use of the aromatic backbone is expected to provide structural stability, avoid double reactions, and contribute largely to the electrical properties of the resultant polymer films. Choudhury and Sarkar84 studied the MLD growth of TMA–HQ (see Fig. 18a, AC-4) using in situ FTIR and QCM, and disclosed a linear growth in the range of 150–225 °C with a GPC of 4.1 Å per cycle at 150 °C and 3.5 Å per cycle at 225 °C. Choudhury and Sarkar84 also revealed that the TMA–HQ films are prone to degradation in air, but ALD-Al2O3 capping films can help improve their stability. In particular, the linear growth of the TMA–HQ dismisses the possibilities of the occurrence of any double reactions during the deposition process. Another precursor PPDA has a very similar structure to HQ but features two amines instead of hydroxyls. Zhou et al.59 studied the TMA–PPDA growth (see Fig. 18a, AC-9) and revealed that the MLD process of TMA–PPDA exhibited a GPC of 1.4 Å per cycle at 400 °C. In addition, the resultant TMA–PPDA films are air sensitive.59 Different from the alucone films from TMA–EG, the alucone films from TMA–PPDA show a severe increase by 30% in thickness when exposed in air for 2 weeks. Given the poor stability of the TMA–PPDA films in air, Zhou alloyed the hybrid films with ALD-Al2O3 and the resultant nanolaminates exhibited improved stability in air.59 In addition, the 1:4 alucone/Al2O3 nanolaminates showed tunable electrical properties.59
TEA as a homobifunctional precursor is first preliminarily studied by Bahlawane et al.85 Lemaire et al.156 later conducted a more comprehensive study by coupling TEA with TMA (see Fig. 18a, AC-8) or TiCl4. They revealed that the resultant amine-containing alucone showed a decreasing growth tendency from 6.7 Å per cycle at 150 °C to 0.8 Å per cycle at 195 °C. The properties of the resultant alucone and titanicone using TEA will be discussed more in the following part for titanicones.
In addition to the organic precursors discussed above, there are also some other homofunctional precursors exposed in the literature but not well documented for their surface chemistry, i.e., FHQ (Fig. 18a, AC-5),91 LC (Fig. 18a, AC-6)146 and GL (Fig. 18a, AC-7).158
4.1.1.2. Heterobifunctional organic precursors. 
Homobifunctional organic reactants (such as EG, BDO, and HDO) typically undergoes a symmetric “double-end” surface reaction. This parasitic reaction process decreases the density of reactive sites available for the subsequent half-reaction and results in slow growth rates and poor material stability.88 For example, Miller et al.86 reported that the alucone from TMA–EG became stiffer after exposure to air. To avoid the double reaction, heterobifunctional reactants and ring open reaction were suggested.15 To this end, Yoon et al.87 first reported an ABC MLD process using TMA, EA, and MA as precursors (see Fig. 13b), in which a heterobifunctional precursor EA and a ring-open reaction of MA was demonstrated. One end of the heterobifunctional reactant may react preferentially to avoid the double reaction. Likewise, ring-open reactants may react and yield a new functional group upon ring-opening that does not react with the initial surface species. These new precursors may be able to achieve much higher growth rates, for there are no double reactions to eliminate active surface species. In the temperature range of 90–170 °C, Yoon et al.87 monitored the three-step alucone film using in situ FTIR and found that the three sequential surface reactions displayed self-limiting growth, showing a decreasing growth trend with temperature from 24 Å per cycle at 90 °C to 4.0 Å per cycle at 170 °C. Yoon et al.87 illustrated the growth mechanism using Fig. 19 or the following reactions. |–OH + Al(CH3)3 (g) → |–O–Al(CH3)2 + CH4 (g)(10A) |–O–Al(CH3)2 + 2NH2CH2CH2OH (g) → |–OAl(OCH2CH2NH2)2 + 2CH4 (g)(10B) |–OAl(OCH2CH2NH2)2 + C4H2O3 (g) → |–OAl(OCH2CH2NH–COCHCHCOOH)2 (g)(10C)

Using QCM, the team in a subsequent study revealed that there is a significant diffusion of TMA into the afore-deposited ABC films, contributing to an extraordinary mass gain.159 In other words, the existing ABC films act as a TMA reservoir during the TMA exposures. Seghete et al.159 elucidated that there exists a threshold ABC film for TMA diffusion. Consequently, there are three regions observed with the three-step ABC film growth. The first region (∼10 cycles on Al2O3 surface) is for formation of the threshold ABC film. As the ABC film grows thicker than the threshold thickness, a larger volume of films is available for TMA diffusion. Accordingly, the growth of the ABC film shows an increase in mass gain per cycle in the second region (about another 20 cycles on Al2O3 surface). Once the ABC film is thicker than the TMA diffusion distance, the growth rate reaches a constant steady state, i.e., the third region (since the 30th cycle on the Al2O3 surface). The diffused TMA molecules are believed to react with the following exposures of EA molecules, and the reaction is regarded as a CVD process. The CVD reaction most likely occurs close to the surface of the ABC film, for EA does not diffuse into the ABC film. In contrast, the third reaction of EA–MA is regarded only as a surface reaction, for MA is a much larger molecule and unable to diffuse into the ABC film. Seghete et al.159 also disclosed that extended purging times are helpful to reduce the diffused TMA in the ABC film. Increasing growth temperatures higher than 130 °C is another effective route to eliminate TMA diffusion into the ABC film. Furthermore, Seghete et al.159 examined the ABC film's stability using XRR at 90 °C, disclosing that the ABC film has the largest change in the first 50–70 hours and then no change in thickness after 300 hours. They found that, after aging in air, the ABC film thickness decreased by 5.8%, in comparison to a decrease of 20% with the TMA–EG film.
In searching for heterobifunctional precursors, there are also efforts on binary MLD processes. Among the studies, two groups almost at the same time independently studied GLY (see Fig. 18b, AC-10) as a substitute for EG for alucones.88,89 Gong et al.88 successfully verified that GLY is a suitable organic precursor to couple with TMA to form solid organic–inorganic networked thin films. Gong et al.88 believed that, during the exposure of GLY, there is a ring-opening/transalkylation reaction occurred to produce (Al–O–CH2–CH(CH3)–CH2–OH) or (Al–O–CH2–CH(CH2–CH3)–OH) groups. During GLY exposures on the Al–CH3 surface, the GLY can bond through Lewis acid/base interaction and by methyl elimination to form Al–O–C– bonds. The remaining hydroxyls then react with TMA during the next step. In spite of their heterobifunctional structures, the GLY molecules were confirmed to be not successful in preventing the double reaction from occurring. Gong et al.88 revealed that the resultant films of TMA–GLY are stable in air and grow at a high GPC. Gong et al.88 further explained that the GPC of TMA–GLY decreases in the temperature range of 90–150 °C from 24 to 6 Å per cycle. Gong et al.88 also examined the thermal and ambient stability of the alucone from TMA–GLY. They disclosed that the TMA–GLY films are stable upon air exposure, having little change in thickness, while the TMA–EG films show a significant decrease in thickness after several days in air. They also revealed that the TMA–GLY films have little change at an annealing temperature of 100 °C for 2 hours, but lose hydroxyl groups at 200 °C and most of C–H species at 300 °C, associated with a film shrinkage during the annealing process.
In another independent study using TMA and GLY, however, Lee et al.89 reported much lower growth rates, e.g., a GPC of 1.3 Å per cycle at 125 °C. Lee et al.89 further confirmed that the growth of TMA–GLY is very sensitive to the purging. Shortening the purge could dramatically increase growth rates. This may explain the different growth rates reported by Lee et al.89 and Gong et al.88 In particular, Lee et al.89 proposed a different mechanism of the TMA–GLY reaction (as illustrated in Fig. 20). They believed that the hydroxyl group of GLY react with AlCH3 surface species and produce alkoxy aluminum surface species. In addition, the oxygen atom in the epoxy ring of GLY can coordinate to the Al atom via Lewis acid/base interactions (Fig. 20b). This Lewis acid/base interaction weakens the C3-oxygen bond of the epoxy ring. In the subsequent exposure of TMA (Fig. 20c), TMA can coordinate to the oxygen in the Al–O–C bond through another Lewis acid/base interaction. Methyl transfer from TMA to position C3 on the epoxy ring and then can occur as shown in Fig. 20d. This methyl transfer forms an 1,2-butanediolate as displayed in Fig. 20a′. Ring-opening after methyl transfer concurrently can form a new Al–O bond between the oxygen in the original epoxy ring and the neighboring Al atom. The proposed reaction sequence can then be repeated by the second GLY exposure, as illustrated in Fig. 20b′. Lee et al.89 also believed that Lewis acid/base interactions are important in the growth mechanism. There are two kinds of Lewis acid/base interactions: (i) one interaction between the Al of the AlCH3 surface species and the oxygen in the epoxy ring and (ii) another interaction between the Al of the TMA reactant and the oxygen in Al–O–C bond. Lee et al.89 asserted that both the Lewis acid/base interactions are essential for the methyl transfer reaction from TMA to the epoxy ring. The methyl transfer reaction between TMA molecules and epoxides without hydroxyl groups, such as propylene oxide, usually does not occur. In particular, Lee et al.89 conducted an additional experiment using DEZ and GLY to verify the importance of Lewis acid/base interactions. They revealed that there was no film growth with the DEZ–GLY, for the Zn atom in DEZ has much less Lewis acidity that is essential for efficient epoxy ring-opening. Lee et al.89 also confirmed that there are no O–H stretching vibrations observed in the FTIR spectra after GLY exposures during the TMA–GLY reaction, implying that GLY reacted with AlCH3 through its hydroxyl group. Lee et al.89 further confirmed that the TMA–GLY films annealed at 300 or 500 °C for 24 hours have no carbon remaining, and have turned into porous Al2O3 films of 27% porosity, in terms of the density of ALD Al2O3 films.

The third heterofunctional precursor reported for MLD alucones is LAC (ε-caprolactone, (CH2)5CO2) (see Fig. 18b, AC-11) by Gong and Parsons.90 They revealed that the MLD process of TMA–LAC presented a decreasing growth tendency with temperature from 0.75 Å per cycle at 60 °C to 0.08 Å per cycle at 120 °C, due to excess precursor absorption on the substrate at lower temperatures. At even higher temperatures of >120 °C, an extreme low growth rate is expected. Based on the data collected from FTIR measurements, Gong and Parsons90 explained the growth mechanism that an Al–CH3 Lewis acid site can catalyze the (CO)–O–C ring-opening to form Al–O and C–CH3 through methyl transfer from the aluminum, and then the Al–O–C group is accessible for reaction during the next TMA exposure. At lower temperatures, more LAC molecules can physisorb and then provide more sites for TMA reaction, and therefore lead to a higher growth rate. In addition, the resultant films show excellent stability in air over 30 days.


4.1.2. Titanicones. 
Among metalcones by MLD, several processes have been developed for titanicones. Binary MLD processes are dominant through coupling TiCl4 (ref. 91, 99, 102, 104, 121, 156, 174, 184 and 185) or TDMATi103 as the Ti sources with one of the organic precursors including EG,102,121,174,184,185 GL,91,99,102 and fumaric acid (FC)104 (see Fig. 21). There is also a four-step ABCD process for a titanicone using the sequence of TiCl4–EA–MC–EA.105 Owing to the different combinations, the resultant titanicones exhibit different growth characteristics and material properties.
 Fig. 21  MLD processes for titanicones by coupling (a) TiCl4 and (b) TDMATi with organic precursors. 
Among all the titanicone MLD processes, the TiCl4–EG couple is the most studied case. George's group conducted a comparative study on the MLD couples of TiCl4–EG (see Fig. 21, TC-1) and TiCl4–GL (see Fig. 21, TC-2).102 In the two coupling combinations, EG is a diol while GL is a triol. The team believed that the triol should lead to a more bridged structure and exhibit better mechanical properties such as toughness. In their study, Abdulagatov et al.102 revealed that, based on XRR measurements, the coupling of TiCl4–EG can realize a constant growth of 4.5 Å per cycle in the range of 90–115 °C, while a further increase to 135 °C decreases the growth rate to 1.5 Å per cycle. In comparison, the TiCl4–GL couple can fulfil a MLD deposition at higher temperatures of 130–210 °C with a decreasing tendency from 2.8 Å per cycle at 130 °C to 2.1 Å per cycle at 210 °C. Using nanoindentation techniques on 500 nm films, Abdulagatov et al.102 disclosed that the film produced from TiCl4–EG has an elastic modulus of ∼8 GPa and a hardness of ∼0.25 GPa, while the film from TiCl4–GL has an elastic modulus of ∼30 GPa and a hardness of ∼2.62 GPa. Applying post-annealing, they further revealed that the TiCl4–GL films have a much better thermal stability up to 250 °C, probably due to their higher network connectivity. XPS depth profiles indicate that no carbon can be detected in the films from the two MLD processes after annealing at 400 °C, i.e., these films have been converted to TiO2.
Lemaire et al.156 used TEA to couple with TiCl4 (see Fig. 21, TC-3) and compared the resultant titanicone with the alucone from TMA–TEA. They disclosed that the resultant amine-containing alucone showed a decreasing growth tendency from 6.7 Å per cycle at 150 °C to 0.8 Å per cycle at 195 °C and titanicone from 5.2 Å per cycle at 150 °C to 2 Å per cycle at 195 °C. The two metalcones were also examined for their stability. Lemaire et al.156 disclosed that, in comparison to the TiCl4–TEA films, the TMA–TEA (see Fig. 18a, AC-8) is more stable under ambient conditions. The TiCl4–TEA films decreased by 6.2% after 24 hours and 14.1% after 500 hours in air, while the TMA–TEA increased by 5.1% after 24 hours and then remained constant over 500 hours. Very interestingly, Lemaire et al.156 found that the TiCl4–TEA films change significantly from 207 to 346.9 nm, a ∼75% increase in thickness with increasing relative humidity from 10% to 65%. Associated with the film thickness swelling, the TiCl4–TEA films change visually in color after prolonged exposure to a humid environment (see Fig. 22). In particular, the shrinking and welling behavior is reversible and repeatable unless the relative humidity exceeded ∼65%, which leads to film degradation. In contrast, the TMA–TEA film thickness has much smaller dependence on humidity, accounting for a change of ∼3% with relative humidity increasing from 10% to 65%. Remaining in the dry heated reactor at 150 °C, furthermore, the TMA–TEA films stayed relatively constant over 14 hours while the TiCl4–TEA films decreased by 25% in mass.

Another effort for Ti-based hybrid polymers was from Li's group.104 In the work, Cao et al. used TiCl4 and FC as the precursor for a new hybrid Ti-polymer, and they reveal that the TiCl4–FC couple (see Fig. 21, TC-4) exhibits a decreasing tendency in growth from 1.1 Å per cycle at 180 °C to 0.49 Å per cycle 300 °C.
Instead of TiCl4, using TDMATi to couple with EG or GL, Van de Kerckhove et al.103 studied the resultant MLD processes for growing titanicones. Based on the measurements of in situ ellipsometry, the researchers found that the TDMATi–EG process (see Fig. 21, TC-5) terminated after a few of cycles and they postulated that the growth termination might be caused by the double-reactions of EG. As a result, reactive sites were bridged by EG without offering new hydroxyl species for the TDMATi molecules. Similar results have reported previously with other MLD processes,72,73 in which bifunctional precursors were used. In comparison to EG, GL has three hydroxyl groups available for reaction. Consequently, Van de Kerckhove et al.103 confirmed that the MLD process of TDMATi–GL (see Fig. 21, TC-6) worked efficiently and sustained self-limiting growth in the temperature range of 80–160 °C with a linearly decreasing growth tendency from 0.95 to 0.24 Å per cycle. Van de Kerckhove et al.103 has attributed the decreases of growth rates to the increasing desorption of TDMATi with increasing temperature.


4.1.3. Zincones. 
Analogous to alucones and titanicones, zincones are the products of the reactions between zinc reactants and organic precursors. There are to date six MLD processes reported for zincones: DEZ–EG,92,93 DEZ–HQ,94–96,165 DEZ–THB (trihydroxybenzene),97 DEZ–HDD (2,4-hexadiyne-1,6-diol),98 DEZ–GL,99 and DEZ–AP (4-aminophenol)165 (see Fig. 23a).
 Fig. 23  MLD processes for (a) zincones and (b) zinc hybrids. 
Following their pioneering work on ALD-alucone using TMA and EG, George's group first reported a new type of metalcones, zincone using DEZ and EG as precursors (see Fig. 23a, ZC-1).92 Yoon et al.92 reported that the DEZ–EG films grow with a decreasing growth tendency from 4 Å per cycle at 90 °C to 0.25 Å per cycle at 170 °C. Similar to the growth mechanism of the TMA–EG, the DEZ–EG growth is related to the surface chemistry and the diffusion of DEZ into the zincone film. The diffused DEZ molecules are available for the subsequent EG exposure to form new zincone polymer chains. The diffusion mechanism can explain the temperature dependence of the DEZ–EG film growth, for less DEZ may diffuse into the zincone film at higher temperatures. Based on FTIR data for the DEZ–EG growth at 90 and 170 °C, Yoon et al.92 found little O–H stretching vibrations at 170 °C while evident O–H stretching vibrations at 90 °C. This suggested that most of the EG molecules reacted twice to –ZnCH2CH3 at 170 °C. XPS measurements on zincone samples identified the Zn composition at different deposition temperatures, changing from 10.7% at 90 °C to 10.6, 9.9, 8.9% at 110, 130, and 150 °C, respectively. Apparently, the results indicate that the Zn atomic percentage are very consistent over the full range of temperatures. In addition, Yoon et al.92 verified that the DEZ–EG films adsorb water after exposure to air. Following the water adsorption, the DEZ–EG films are very stable for multiple weeks. Independently, Parsons' group studied the process of DEZ–EG nearly at the same time.93 Peng et al.93 confirmed a decreasing growth tendency with temperature in the range of 100–170 °C using QCM measurements, but reported large growth rates compared to those from Yoon et al.92 (this should be due to variances in their experiments). Furthermore, they also examined the stability of the DEZ–EG films, and verified that the films are stable in dry air for 3 days. Using FTIR, in addition, Peng et al.93 also observed that the DEZ–EG films are prone to adsorb water under ambient conditions for 1 hour but have no more changes up to 12 hours. This indicates that the reaction between the DEZ–EG films and moisture from the ambient environment proceeded quickly, resulting in hydrolyzed DEZ–EG films. A further annealing on the hydrolyzed DEZ–EG films at 100 °C for 2 hours produced a structure similar to the ALD ZnO.
HQ has been chosen as an alternative precursor to replace EG, for its conjugated structure was expected to produce electrically conductive polymers.94 In addition, as discussed above for alucones, the rigid structure of HQ is expected to reduce the possibility of double reactions as disclosed in the processes TMA–EG82 and DEZ–EG.92 Yoon et al. reported their first attempt at the DEZ–HQ films (see Fig. 23a, ZC-2) in the temperature range of 130–170 °C and revealed a linear growth with a GPC of 1.6 Å per cycle at 150 °C.94 In their later studies,95,96 Yoon et al. explored conductive hybrid materials by combining ALD-ZnO with the MLD zincone of DEZ–HQ for various nanolaminates (alloys). They disclosed that, in comparison to the conductivity of 14 S cm−1 for ALD ZnO, the ZnO:zincone alloys of 1:1 and 2:2 cycle ratios yielded conductivities of 116 and 170 S cm−1, respectively. Thus, combining ALD with MLD proves viable for tuning electrical conductivities of hybrid materials. Other researchers also confirmed that the alloys of ALD-ZnO/MLD-zincone are tunable in electrical properties.162,163
Similar to the diol of HQ, the triol of THB has also been investigated as a precursor to couple with DEZ.97 Han and Sung97 revealed that the MLD process of DEZ–THB (see Fig. 23a, ZC-3) can be fulfilled in the range of 100–160 °C. They disclosed a GPC of 2.6 Å per cycle but did not designate the related temperature(s). Another new MLD process for zincones was reported by Cho,98 using DEZ and HDD as precursors (see Fig. 23a, ZC-4). This DEZ–HDD process exhibited a GPC of 5.2 Å per cycle in the range of 100–150 °C. In particular, the DEZ–HDD films showed excellent stability in air up to 400 °C. Two other MLD processes of DEZ–GL (see Fig. 23a, ZC-5)99 and DEZ–AP (see Fig. 23a, ZC-6)165 have been exposed in the literature but there are no detailed studies reported. There is also a zinc-based hybrid material reported using DEZ–ODA165 (see Fig. 23b).


4.1.4. Other metalcones. 
In addition to the above MLD processes for alucones, titanicones, and zincones, there are also some other metalcones reported, including zircones, hafnicones, mangancones, and vanadicones (see Fig. 24). All these together demonstrate MLD being a viable and highly flexible tool for various materials with tunable properties.
 Fig. 24  MLD processes for (a) zircones, (b) hafnicones, (c) mangancones, and (d) vanadicones. 
George's group expanded their studies of metalcones to zircones, hafnicones, and mangancones. Using ZTB and EG as precursors (see Fig. 24a),100,101 they revealed that the growth rate of zircones decreases with temperature from 1.6 Å per cycle at 105 °C to 0.3 Å per cycle at 195 °C. By forming alloys of ALD-ZrO2/MLD-zircone, Lee et al.100 confirmed that the resultant hybrid films are tunable in optical properties (refractive index, between 1.63 for pure zircone and 1.86 for pure ZrO2 ALD films) and mechanical properties (elastic modulus and hardness, gradually increasing with the fraction of ZrO2 ALD cycles). In addition, the alloys also show very promising electrical properties. Using TDMAHf as the hafnium (Hf) precursor to couple with EG, Lee et al.106 reported that the hafnicone films of TDMAHf–EG (see Fig. 24b) exhibit a decreasing growth trend with temperature from 1.2 Å per cycle at 105 °C to 0.4 Å per cycle at 205 °C. Nanoindentation measurements were applied on the resultant hafnicone films and showed that the elastic modulus and hardness of the films are ∼47 and 2.6 GPa, respectively. In addition, a MLD process has been mentioned using Mn(CpEt)2 and EG for a mangancone (see Fig. 24c),91 but there have been no more details reported.
Recently, two new processes have been reported in a study107 for vanadicones, using EG or GL to couple with TEMAV (see Fig. 24d). In the study, Van de Kerckhove et al.107 disclosed that the coupling of TEMAV and EG (see Fig. 24d, VC-1) cannot proceed for vanadicone films, possibly due to the double-end reaction of EG. In contrast, the coupling of TEMAV and GL (see Fig. 24d, VC-2) was confirmed a reliable process for vanadicones, showing a linearly decreasing growth tendency from ∼1.2 Å per cycle at 80 °C to ∼0.5 Å per cycle at 180 °C. Executing heat treatment on the as-deposited vanadicone films to 500 °C in air or He atmosphere for 10 min, Van de Kerckhove et al.107 found that the films change into crystalline V2O5 in air while remains amorphous in He. In situ XRD revealed that the crystallization of the vanadicone films started from 320 °C in air. XPS analysis that there are a considerable amount of carbon remained in the annealed films in He, but little in the annealed films in air. In addition, Van de Kerckhove et al.107 did not find any porosity induced by the annealing either in air or in He, but they found the films reduce in film thickness. Furthermore, Van de Kerckhove et al.107 investigated the electrochemical performance of the as-deposited and annealed vanadicone films as cathodes in lithium-ion batteries and revealed that the films annealed in He showed the best performance. This will be discussed in the following parts.

4.2. Other metal-based hybrid polymers
Besides metalcones discussed above, recent research efforts have been demonstrating MLD's tremendous capabilities for many more hybrid materials in a large variety of applications including luminescence, porous materials, batteries, and magnetics using binary MLD processes. These MLD processes have been summarized in Fig. 25 and 26. In addition, new MLD processes using multiple precursors also represent a new trend for tunable fabrication of novel polymeric films, as summarized in Fig. 27.

4.2.1. New binary MLD processes. 
4.2.1.1. Luminescent materials. 
Metal quinolones (Mqx) are very promising hybrid luminescent materials. MLD processes of Mqx were first developed by Nilsen et al.118,119 Using 8-hydroxyquinoline (8-HQ) to couple with TMA, DEZ, or TiCl4, Nilson et al.119 synthesized Alq3, Znq2, or Tiq4, respectively (see Fig. 25a). The three metal quinolones exhibit decreasing growth rates with temperature, having a growth rate of 4–7 Å per cycle at 80 °C but no growth at 200 °C. The Alq3 was examined for stability at 85 °C and it was found that the Alq3 is stable to water at 85 °C.119 Räupke et al. later in a study demonstrated the luminescent performance of MLD Alq3 films.164
4.2.1.2. Metal–organic framework (MOF). 
Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), also known as porous coordination polymers (PCPs), are crystalline coordination polymers built from inorganic nodes (bridging ligands) and organic linkers.186,187 One of the most remarkable features of MOFs is their extremely high porosity, consequently featuring high surface areas and high pore volumes in uniformly tailorable pores. In addition, MOF's mechanical and chemical properties are also tunable by carefully selecting the linker molecule or introducing guest molecules into the pores. These unique characteristics make MOFs very promising in many applications such as gas storage and separation,188–191 luminescence,192 drug delivery,193,194 energy conversion and storage,195,196 and catalysis.186,197,198
Ritala's group initiated the first study on using MLD for synthesis of MOFs,112 in which they called the process as ALD instead (see Fig. 25b, MOF-5). In the work, Salmi et al.112 adopted ZnAc2 and BDC as precursors for MOF-5, a isoreticular MOF (also known as IRMOF-1) having a cubic framework structure and consisting of ZnO4 clusters connected with rigid benzene dicarboxylate linkers. Their study revealed that the resultant films present a decreasing growth rate from 6.5 Å per cycle at 225 °C to 4.5 Å per cycle at 325 °C. There is no film growth at 350 °C. Unfortunately, in the whole deposition temperature range, no crystalline phases have been grown. Surprisingly, however, the as-deposited amorphous films could crystalize into an unidentified structure at room temperature under a relative humidity of 60%. This moisture-induced structure was confirmed with no porosity, but could be recrystallized into the MOF-5 phase in an autoclave with DMF at 150 °C, confirmed with micro- and macroporosity.
In one of their following efforts, Salmi et al.113 used NDC for replacing BDC to couple with ZnAc2 for growing IRMOF-8. Their study disclosed that the MLD films of ZnAc2–NDC (see Fig. 25b, IRMOF-8) exhibit a linear decreasing growth rate from 4.9 Å per cycle at 260 °C to 4.0 Å per cycle at 300 °C. Again, the as-deposited films are amorphous, but could be crystallized into an unknown structure at room temperature under a relative humidity of 70%. The unknown crystallized structure was further recrystallized in an autoclave with DMF at 150 °C, and turned into IRMOF-8. The crystallization in humid air was confirmed being critical, for the as-deposited films could not be directly turned into IRMOF-8 only via the second crystallization. Furthermore, Salmi et al.113 verified the films via the recrystallization are porous and they successfully loaded Pd into the porous films uniformly.
A latest work on MOFs was reported by Ahvenniemi and Karppinen114 for copper(II)terephthalate (i.e., Cu–TPA, also MOF-2) using Cu(thd)2 and BDC as precursors (see Fig. 25b, MOF-2). The new research attempt found out that this MLD process of Cn(thd)2–BDC can directly grow porous crystalline Cu–TPA films at the temperatures of 180–195 °C. A further increase in growth temperature delivered amorphous films up to 260 °C. In the whole temperature range of 180–260 °C, the growth rate decreases from 3 to 0.2 Å per cycle.
4.2.1.3. Energy-storage materials. 
Using Li(thd) (thd = 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-3,5-heptanedionate) and terephthalic acid (benzene-1,4-dicarboxylic acid, or TPA) as precursors, Nisula and Karppinen115 developed a lithium-containing crystalline hybrid polymer, lithium terephthalate (LTP) (see Fig. 26a). They revealed that the MLD process of LTP sustained a self-limiting growth during the temperature of 200–280 °C with a decreasing tendency from ∼4.0 to 1.0 Å per cycle. Electrochemical testing confirmed that this LTP hybrid films are promising anodes in lithium-ion microbatteries.
4.2.1.4. Organic magnets. 
Organic molecule-based magnets (MBMs) are a relatively new class of magnetic materials, in which molecular moieties bearing unpaired spin density interact electronically and magnetically.199 The first experimental realization appeared in 1985.200 Compared to conventional metallurgic and ceramic magnets, the main benefits of MBMs are usually associated with their lightweight, mechanical flexibility, tunable color or transparency, low-temperature processing, solubility, and compatibility with polymers and other classes of molecular materials.199 The M[TCNE] (M = 3d metal; TCNE = tetracyanoethylene) complexes represent one of the most interesting classes of MBMs, possessing numerous compositions and structures with varying dimensionalities of magnetic coupling from one-dimensional (1D) inorganic polymer chains and two-dimensional (2D) layers to three-dimensional (3D) networks and amorphous solids.199,200
Kao et al. reported a MLD attempt at synthesizing an organic-based magnet, V[TCNE]x using tetracyanoethylene (TCNE) and vanadium hexacarbonyl (V(CO)6) at RT116 (see Fig. 26b, MBM-1). V[TCNE]x is a promising organic-based magnet for future organic/molecular electronic, magnetic, and spintronic applications. They described the MLD process of V(CO)6–TCNE as follows: |–TCNE + xV(CO)6 (g) → |–TCNE–(V(CO)y)x + x(6 − y)CO (g)(11A) |–TCNE–(V(CO)y)x + zTCNE (g) → |–TCNE–Vx–TCNEz + xyCO (g)(11B)
Using AFM, Kao et al. revealed a linear growth with a growth rate of 9.8 Å per cycle. In addition, the air stability of the V[TCNE]x films was examined, showing a 50% increase in film resistance in the first day and another 13% increase in the following 4 days. In a subsequent effort, Kao et al. further synthesized two more organic-based magnetic materials using Co2(CO)8 as the Co source, i.e., Co[TCNE]x (see Fig. 26b, MBM-2) and CoxVy[TCNE]z at room temperature.117 Based on AFM data, they disclosed a growth rate of 8 Å per cycle for Co[TCNE]x. Through alternatively growing V[TCNE]x and Co[TCNE]x layers, Kao et al. developed CoxVy[TCNE]z. However, they also pointed out that the growth rate of CoxVy[TCNE]z was rather unstable compared to that of V[TCNE]x and Co[TCNE]x alone.


4.2.2. Complex MLD processes. 
MLD is a highly flexible technique also enabling to combine multiple precursors for organic and organic–inorganic hybrid materials. Sung's group first developed a unique four-step MLD process for growing self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) connected by metal oxides, including TOx–SAMs,109 ZrOx–SAMs,110 AlOx–SAMs.111 For instance, the MLD process of TiOx–SAMs109 (see Fig. 27a, SAM-1) involves four steps: (i) 7-octenyltrichlorosilane (7-OTS, CH2CH(CH2)6SiCl3) with water was first dosed to form an alkene-terminated alkylsiloxane SAM on substrates, (ii) O3 was then dosed to convert the terminal CC groups of the SAM into carboxylic groups, and (iii) TTIP and (iv) water were dosed sequentially to produce titanium hydroxyl groups for the anchoring of the next monolayers (see Fig. 28). In the work, Lee et al.109 disclosed that the growth rate measured using TEM is 11 Å per cycle in the range of 150–200 °C. In particular, the resulting TOx–SAMs are stable in air up to 450 °C and start to decompose at 500 °C. After the decomposition at 600 °C, polycrystalline TiO2 is obtained. By adopting the above four-step procedure but using a Zr precursor (ZTB) to replace TTIP, Sung's group developed another ZrOx–SAM (see Fig. 27a, SAM-2) with a growth rate of 12.3 Å per cycle at 170 °C.110 Similarly, another AlOx–SAM (see Fig. 27a, SAM-3) was synthesized using ATIP as the Al precursor by Sung's group, exhibiting a growth rate of 12 Å per cycle in the range of 150–200 °C.111 There is also an AlOx–SAM reported using TMA as the Al precursor (see Fig. 27a, SAM-4), showing a decreasing growth from 5.5 Å per cycle at 100 °C to 2.5 Å per cycle at 200 °C.169,170 All the MOx–SAMs reported exhibited good mechanical flexibility and stability, excellent insulating properties, and relatively high dielectric capacitances with a high dielectric strength, showing promising applications as nanohybrid dielectrics.167,168,170

Knez's group also demonstrated a MLD process consisting of a four-step procedure of TiCl4–EA–MC–EA to produce a titanicone105 (see Fig. 27b). Using this coupling combination, Chen et al.105 demonstrated the high flexibility of MLD processes for a wide range of hybrid materials. At 100 °C, this four-step MLD process receives a growth rate of 6 Å per cycle. The resultant Ti-hybrid polymer films were later used for producing nitrogen-doped porous TiO2 nanotubes for improved photocatalytic activity. Qin's group reported another four-step MLD procedure of DEZ–PD–EDA–PD for a Zn-based hybrid polymer108 (see Fig. 27c) with a growth rate of 5 Å per cycle at 100 °C.

5. Organic–inorganic hybrid nanolaminates by MLD and ALD
Based on the afore-discussed MLD processes, it is easy to realize that MLD is very powerful in synthesizing a large variety of organic and organic–inorganic hybrid materials with an accurately controlled mode at the molecular level. Given the fact that ALD is a well-developed technique for fabricating inorganic materials at the atomic level, scientists have conducted some studies and smartly initiated a new area by combining MLD with ALD for some organic–inorganic hybrid materials with a tunable composition of organic and inorganic components, showing many unexpected properties. Consequently, this strategy has paved a new avenue for uncountable new nanolaminate materials featuring desirable attributes.
Combining the MLD process of TiOx–SAMs with the ALD process of TTIP–H2O, Lee et al. demonstrated that various TiOx–SAMs/TiO2 nanolaminate films (see Fig. 29) can be accurately realized in a highly tunable fabrication mode.109 The thickness of SAMs and TiO2 nanolayers in each sample could be controlled by adjusting the number of MLD and ALD cycles with the SAMs and TiO2 growth rates of ∼11 and 0.6 Å per cycle, respectively. Similarly, the nanolaminates of AlOx–SAMs/Al2O3, AlOx–SAMs/ZnO, and AlOx–SAMs/Al2O3/AlOx–SAMs/ZnO were also reported.169

Combining ALD-ZnO (using DEZ and water) and MLD processes of zinc-based polymeric films (DEZ–HQ, DEZ–AP, and DEZ–ODA), a series of nanolaminates of ZnO/zinc-polymeric film have been synthesized by Tynell et al.165 There are also nanolaminates of Al2O3/alucone reported,151 in which Al2O3 was deposited by ALD using TMA and water, and the alucone was performed by MLD using TMA and EG.
Not limited to the afore-discussed hybrid nanolaminates, there are still many more reported. In general, the hybrid nanolaminates by both ALD and MLD present many more unexpected properties and this strategy provides unlimited opportunities. In fact, there are uncountable combinations of ALD-deposited inorganics and MLD-deposited polymeric materials. This type of integration of ALD and MLD is relatively unexplored and lays a new avenue for researchers to search for new materials with desirable properties.
6. Promising applications
6.1. New MLD strategies for nanostructured inorganic materials
As discussed above, MLD apparently can bring forth a large variety of pure and hybrid polymers and, its combination with ALD even delivers an unlimited account of organic–inorganic hybrid materials with desirable mechanical, electrical, optical, and chemical properties. More interesting, the resulting pure and hybrid polymeric nanofilms from MLD processes can further serve as precursors to a new set of nanostructured carbon, carbon-based composites, and metal oxides through some suitable post-treatment under different atmospheres.

6.1.1. Nanoscale carbon materials. 
Qin's group deposited polyimide films on Au nanoparticles and into nanopores of porous anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) templates, using PDMA and EDA as precursors.173 The as-deposited polyimide films were pyrolized at 600 °C under the H2/Ar atmosphere and then turned into carbon nanofilms by the pyrolysis. The pyrolysis led to a shrinkage of 70% of the polyimide films in thickness. Raman measurement disclosed that the carbon nanofilms exhibited both D and G bands of carbon materials, while neither of these bands were with the polyimide films. The D band is related to the disordered features of carbon materials while the G band represents the vibration mode within aromatic carbon rings. Thus, the G band indicates that some graphitized domains were produced by the annealing. Furthermore, Yang et al.173 verified that a higher temperature of 900 °C was helpful for gaining a better graphitized structure. In particular, XPS measurements revealed that the heat treatment changed the amine N and quaternary N into pyridine N and pyridone N. The pyridinic N is very beneficial for applications of electrocatalysis. Therefore, Yang et al.173 produced core–shell Au@C nanoparticles and amorphous nitrogen-doped CNTs (see Fig. 30a and b).

More recently, Qin's group used a polyimide MLD process of PMDA–DDE to coat graphene for graphene-supported nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) films.137 Chen et al.137 confirmed that the MLD polyimide coatings could be directly deposited on the graphene samples. In other words, there is no need for pretreating the graphene samples. The MLD-polyimide coatings were tunable in thickness on graphene and the resultant polyimide-coated graphene samples were carbonized with a two-step heating procedure: (i) a complete imidization at 300 °C for 1 hour and (ii) a full carbonization at 700 °C for 1 hour. XPS analysis137 revealed that, after the pyrolysis at 700 °C, the predominant N species of the resultant NC films are quaternary N instead of the amino N in the MLD-polyimide coatings. Chen et al.137 demonstrated that the NC-coated graphene is promising as electrodes in supercapacitors.


6.1.2. Nanoscale carbon-tunable composites. 
Based on organic–inorganic hybrid materials via MLD, pyrolysis under argon can turn the hybrid polymers into metal oxide/carbon composites while annealing in air can produce porous metal oxides. Abdulagatov et al.91 first studied the pyrolysis of MLD-produced organic–inorganic polymers in argon. An important advantage of using MLD metalcone films as precursors to ceramic films via pyrolysis is that they are deposited conformally on the starting substrates.82 Abdulagatov et al.91 conducted a systematic study on the pyrolysis of MLD titanicone films. Using Raman spectroscopy, they revealed that the pyrolyzed titanicone films (deposited using TiCl4 and GL) exhibited evident D (disordered) and G (graphitic) band, both commonly observed in the spectra of amorphous carbon materials containing nanocrystalline graphitic domains.91,201 In contrast, as illustrated in Fig. 30c, the as-deposited 500 nm titanicone films were absent from both the D and G bands. The intensity of the D and G bands increased with pyrolysis temperature from 600 to 900 °C, while the ratio of D/G showed an increasing tendency as well. Along with the carbonization of the titanicone films, Abdulagatov et al.91 also used XRD to reveal that the amorphous as-deposited titanicone films produced crystalline TiO2, changing from anatase at 600 °C to rutile phase at 900 °C gradually. As shown in Fig. 30d by the SEM image, the titanicone films turned into uniform nanoparticles of ∼30 nm after the pyrolysis at 800 °C. Furthermore, Abdulagatov et al.91 also utilized XPS depth profiling to detect the distribution of elements of the titanicone films pyrolyzed at 800 and 900 °C, shown in Fig. 30e and f, respectively. They noticed that the initial 500 nm films shrank into 280 nm. Evidently, carbon is distributed throughout the films but there is more carbon near the film surfaces, implying that there is a phase separation between TiO2 and carbon at higher temperatures. It is particularly interesting that Abdulagatov et al.91 further explored the electrical properties of the pyrolyzed titanicone films. They found that the sheet resistance dramatically decreased from 500 to 700 °C, accounting for a decrease of 10000 times, while the as-deposited 115 nm titanicone film was too resistive and not measureable using a four-pint probe. A further increase in pyrolysis temperature slightly decreased the resistance and reached a minimum at 800 °C, but then slightly increased the resistance with temperature up to 900 °C. After pyrolysis at 800 °C, the as-deposited film reduced to 88 nm and then a resistivity of 0.19 Ω cm was calculated, 13 orders of magnitude lower than the resistivity of rutile TiO2.
In addition to the pyrolysis of titanicone films from TiCl4–GL, Abdulagatov et al.91 also made a survey on other metalcones, including titanicone (from TiCl4–EG), alucones (from TMA–GL, TMA–EG, TMA–HQ, and TMA–FHQ), zincones (from DEZ–GL and DEZ–HQ), zircone (from ZTB–EG), hafnicone (from TDMAHf–EG), and mangancone (from Mn(CpEt)2–EG). Except for the mangancone films, all the other metalcones exhibited D and G bands after pyrolysis at 900 °C. Abdulagatov et al.91 believed that the absence of carbon in the pyrolyzed mangancone films is due to carbonthermal reduction of manganese oxide by graphitic carbon at the pyrolysis temperature of 900 °C. They also disclosed that a lower pyrolysis temperature of 600 °C under argon avoided carbonthermal reduction of the mangancone films and produced D and G bands.
In a following study, George's group conducted a very inspiring work using in situ FTIR.155 In the work, DuMont et al.155 revealed the evolutions of two alucones (i.e., AlEG from TMA–EG and AlHQ from TMA–HQ) during pyrolysis. For the alucone from TMA–EG, FTIR spectra revealed that the as-deposited films have features of C–H, C–C, and C–O. Pyrolysis produced no changes on FTIR spectra at temperatures lower than 350 °C, but greatly reduced absorbance spectra at temperatures higher than 400 °C. All absorbances related to hydrogen in the alucone film were lost by 550 °C, and there was a similar decreasing trend for C–C and C–O absorbance features. At the same time, there were a variety of gases such as H2, H2O, CO, CO2, and light alkane gases detected by using a mass spectrometer. However, the Al–O stretching vibrations increased and shifted toward lower wavenumbers with increased temperatures. DuMont et al.155 believed that the shift was due to the Al–O alkoxide linkage in the alucone film converted to Al–O vibrations in Al2O3 domains. In addition, DuMont et al.155 also noticed a new absorbance in the range of 1300–1700 cm−1 and could remain after pyrolysis at 600 °C, ascribed to carboxylate species (R–COO−). The carboxylate species were believed to exist at the interfaces between Al2O3 and carbon domains and served as an anchor for carbonaceous residue formed from polymer thermal degradation. Furthermore, DuMont et al.155 revealed that the pyrolyzed alucone AlEG are not electrically conductive. In comparison to AlEG, DuMont et al.155 also studied the evolution of AlHQ during pyrolysis using in situ FTIR. It was observed that the CC vibrations of the phenylene ring are lost while the other carbon-related species (including C–H and C–O) are reduced after pyrolysis at 450 °C. At the same time, the background infrared absorbance increases dramatically at temperatures of >450 °C, implying increased electrical conductivity. This is consistent to their measurements of electrical sheet resistance. After pyrolysis at a higher temperature of 850 °C, the pyrolyzed AlHQ films exhibit a low electrical resistivity of 0.28 Ω cm. Based on this study, DuMont et al.155 pointed out that it is important to select organic precursors for growing alucone films. To form an electrically conducting film, the organic precursor must contain enough carbon to form an electrically conducting network after pyrolysis. In comparison, EG contains only two carbon atoms while HQ contains six carbon atoms. Thus, AlHQ has enough carbon atom to form conducting films. Furthermore, DuMont et al.155 confirmed using TEM that the pyrolyzed AlEG and AlHQ films remain conformal coverings on nanoparticles.
In tuning carbon contents in metalcones, Lushington et al.145 demonstrated another route, in which two MLD processes were combined. Specifically, one MLD process was realized using TMA and EG, and another using EG and TPC. By adjusting the cycle ratios of the two MLD processes, the team controlled the C contents in the resultant hybrid materials. The resultant hybrid materials were then proceeded for pyrolysis at various temperatures from 600–900 °C under 5% H2/Ar. Raman analysis on the pyrolyzed samples of 1:1 and 1:3 of TMA–EG/EG–TPC commonly revealed D and G bands, and sheet resistance measurements further showed a dramatic drop in resistance with increased temperatures down to 900 °C. Lushington et al.145 ascribed the resistance drop to the formation of nanocrystalline graphite. In comparison, the 1:3 hybrid materials have a much smaller sheet resistance than the 1:1 hybrid materials after pyrolysis at 900 °C. Lushington et al.145 believed that this should be due to an increased C content with the 1:3 hybrid materials. A further increase to 1000 °C for pyrolysis, however, increased sheet resistance of both the 1:1 and 1:3 hybrid materials. The exact reason is still not clear.


6.1.3. Porous metal oxide films. 
In addition to the afore-discussed pyrolysis under the protection of Ar, there are studies conducted on MLD hybrid films in the presence of air, which disclosed new structures. The studies uncovered that thermal annealing or mild water etching can remove the organic fragments of hybrid polymers and thereby create porous metal oxide networks. These porous metal oxide structures have been demonstrated to be promising in hydrogen separation,202 stabilization of Pt and Ni nanoparticles,161,203 and novel nanostructured materials.150
Liang et al.149 first reported microporous–mesoporous Al2O3 films by decomposing MLD alucone coatings of Al(OCH2CH2O)1.9 from TMA and EG. In their study, Liang and co-workers noticed that a 25 nm alucone coating deposited on 250 nm SiO2 nanoparticles lost its carbon species mostly when soaked in water for one day, but Al in the alucone films remained on the particle surface to form a more stable composite. According to nitrogen adsorption and desorption isotherms, Liang et al. further revealed that the remaining Al composites are porous with micropores of ∼0.6 nm (using the Horvath–Kawazoe method) and mesopores of 4.3 nm (using the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda method). They disclosed that the highest surface area of 143.5 m2 g−1 was achieved after 1 day soaking and 142.3 m2 g−1 after 3 day soaking. In their further investigation, Liang et al.149 confirmed that a 75 nm alucone coating is not permeable. Exposing the alucone coating to water vapor for different times, the coating then became porous with increased permeability. Using thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), Liang et al.149 also investigated the oxidation of the alucone MLD coatings in air and found that the organic groups in the coatings were mainly released during the oxidation temperature ramping process to 400 °C. After the oxidation, a conformal porous film remained on the SiO2 nanoparticle surface with an obvious film thickness drop from 15 to 8 nm. They pointed out that, during the oxidation process, all the carbon and hydrogen in the films were burned out and aluminum was converted to Al2O3. Liang et al. also believed that, because the alucone film contained sufficient oxygen, there is no additional oxygen needed to convert aluminum to Al2O3. They also estimated that the remaining porous Al2O3 film is about 13.2% of the resultant SiO2@Al2O3. Liang et al. further calculated that the surface area of the porous film itself was ∼1250 m2 g−1 at 400 °C while ∼330 m2 g−1 at 1000 °C in air. They clarified that there were more micropores of 0.6 nm formed at 400 °C while more mesopores of ∼3.8 nm formed at 1000 °C.
Aimed at tuning the pore size of the porous Al2O3 films, in a subsequent study Liang et al.160 utilized another ABC process of TMA–EA–MA for a MLD alucone to coat SiO2 nanoparticles. In comparison to the MLD process of TMA–EG with the carbon chains (–CH2CH2–), the TMA–EA–MA can produce longer carbon chains of (–AlCH3–OCH2CH2NH–C(O)CHCHCOO–Al–), and Liang et al.160 expected that longer carbon chains would contribute to larger pores after oxidation in air or water etching. Interestingly, Liang et al.160 found that the surface area of SiO2 nanoparticles decreased slightly with increased MLD cycles up to 20 cycles, but increased after 20 MLD cycles. They explained that this should be ascribed to a porous structure within the ABC MLD alucone films, which might have formed during the coating process or after exposure to air. This is very different from the AB films of TMA–EG that show a dense and impermeable structure. Liang et al.160 also revealed that, based on EDS (energy-dispersive spectroscopy) composition analysis, most of the carbon in the ABC alucone films was gone after only 1 day of soaking time or 1 hour of oxidation in air at 400 °C. TEM analysis on the ABC alucone-coated SiO2 nanoparticles before and after 1 hour oxidation in air at 400 °C disclosed that there are conformal films on SiO2 nanoparticles in both cases. In addition, their film thicknesses are very close. This is probably due to the ABC alucone films decomposing or shrinking during the coating process or after exposure to air. Thus, Liang et al.160 suspected that the ABC alucone films are more sensitive to heat treatment or water vapor than the AB MLD film of TMA–EG. Using nitrogen adsorption and desorption isotherms, Liang et al.160 revealed that the pore size is centered at 0.6–0.8 nm, larger than the pore size of porous alumina films formed from the AB alucone of TMA–EG, centered at 0.6 nm. For the porous films formed by decomposition in water, there are two pore size distributions, centered at either 0.8 or 17 nm. These larger pores could result from the collapse of micropores, for these particles were directly soaked in water and there was no control over the degradation of the polymer component in the MLD films. It is expected that more uniform porous structures could be formed using water vapor for degradation of the polymer component. The porous structures of the decomposed ABC MLD films were confirmed to increase the surface areas of the SiO2 nanoparticles from 10 m2 g−1 for pristine SiO2 particles and 7.8 m2 g−1 for 40-cycle MLD-coated SiO2 particles to 48 m2 g−1 for particles soaked in water for 1 day and 46 m2 g−1 for particles oxidized in air at 400 °C for 1 hour. This indicates that the surface area of the porous alumina itself is much higher and verifies that the pore size of the porous alumina films could be tuned using organic precursors with different carbon chain lengths. In addition, Liang et al.160 confirmed that the porous alumina films are amorphous, but can be etched away in the presence of water especially at elevated temperature.


6.1.4. Design of novel nanostructures. 
Using MLD processes, Knez's group creatively developed some novel nanostructures for promising applications.105,150 One study conducted by Qin et al.150 reported a very novel nanostructure, CuOx nanoparticles supported on porous Al2O3 nanotubes. The development process is illustrated in Fig. 31. In the process, CuO nanowires were first coated by a dense layer of alucone using a MLD process of TMA–EG at 100 °C (see Fig. 31a). Then, a subsequent reduction using H2 at 650 °C turned the resultant core–shell CuO@alucone nanowires into Cu nanoparticles embedded in nanoporous Al2O3 nanotubes (see Fig. 31b) and a further annealing of Cu nanoparticles in air at 400 °C delivered an unexpected nanostructure, i.e., CuOx nanoparticles supported on nanoporous Al2O3 nanotubes (see Fig. 31c). Qin et al.150 demonstrated that the hydrogen reduction could turn the alucone coatings into nanoporous Al2O3 nanotubes, which, in contrast to the inability of nonporous Al2O3 nanotubes, are critical for delivering the CuOx nanoparticles supported on their outside walls. They further revealed that the wall thickness of the nanoporous Al2O3 nanotubes can be used to tune the particle sizes of the resultant CuOx, showing a trend that the size distribution becomes narrower with the increase in thickness of the porous Al2O3 shells. Qin et al.150 clearly explained that, due to the smaller atomic size of Cu, the diffusion of Cu outward through the porous Al2O3 shells is more pronounced, and the outward diffusing Cu will finally encounter oxygen at the nanopore openings. Therefore, CuOx nanoparticles are produced and supported on the outer walls of the hollow Al2O3 nanotubes. The CuOx nanoparticles can be CuO and/or Cu2O, depending on the oxidation process. In general, Cu2O is initially formed after diffusion of Cu to the nanotube surface and then some Cu2O nanoparticles are further oxidized to form CuO. Qin et al.150 also pointed out that these CuOx nanoparticles could be further reduced using hydrogen to produce metallic Cu nanoparticles supported on the nanoporous Al2O3 nanotubes. In another work, Chen et al. applied the four-step procedure of TiCl4–EA–MC–EA to coat CuO nanowires with Ti-hybrid polymer films.105 After annealing in H2/Ar at 600 °C for 2 hours, porous polycrystalline nitrogen-doped TiO2 nanotubes are obtained. In addition, the substrate CuO nanowires disappear and Cu particles are observed at the terminal ends of the porous TiO2 nanotubes as the result of out-diffusion.

6.2. Surface engineering
Surface engineering plays important roles in many scientific and industrial applications, such as friction, wear resistance, corrosion resistance, wettability, biocompatibility, mechanical stiffness, optical properties, and so on. The powerful capabilities of MLD provide numerous candidates of polymeric and hybrid polymeric materials for tuning surfaces with improved properties. The studies so far demonstrated MLD as well as its combination with ALD being a very useful technique in surface engineering.

6.2.1. Wettability. 
Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) feature structural perfectness and chemically inert nature, and have highly hydrophilic properties. Using MLD, Chen et al.144 made an attempt at modifying CNTs' wettability. Adopting the MLD process of PE–ED, Chen successfully applied a film of polyurea on multiwalled CNTs (MWCNTs). It is still not clear how the MLD precursors are anchored on the inert surface of CNTs, but Chen et al.144 hypothesized that PD might have noncovalently adhered onto the surface of MWCNTs via strong physical adsorption, owing to its planar, phenyl system and negatively charged terminal isocyanate. Therefore, the physisorbed PD reacted with the sequentially dosed ED and formed a more stable complex that does not desorb from the sidewalls of the CNTs. Chen et al.144 demonstrated that the MLD polyurea grows linearly on MWCNTs with a GPC of 4.1 Å per cycle at 65 °C. The solubility of the uncoated and polyurea-coated CNTs were investigated in different solvents. Chen et al.144 found that, in contrast to the pristine MWCNTs, the polyurea-coated MWCNTs are easy to be dispersed in organic solvents, and the dispersion stability depends on not only whether the MWCNTs were modified but also the polarity of the solvents. They further clarified that the polyurea-coated MWCNTs were dispersed well in high polar solvents including DMF, 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (NMP), and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to form homogenous black solutions. These solutions could remain stable for weeks under ambient conditions. This is due to the increased polarity of the coated MWCNTs caused by the functional groups of the polyurea. Chen et al.144 also pointed out that the polyurea-coated MWCNTs exhibited poor solubility in less polar solvents such as water, due to the hydrophobic nature of the polyurea coating. The polyurea-coated MWCNTs were further used as additives in polyurethane composites for improved mechanical properties and turned out a dramatic increase in tensile strength and modulus of 50.7% and 152.33%, respectively. This was ascribed to the improved chemical compatibility between the polyurea-coated MWCNTs and the polyurethane, and thereby better dispersion and interfacial adhesion.
In addition, Oldham et al.157 developed three layers of coatings consisting of ALD-ZnO/MLD-alucone (TMA–GLY)/ALD-Al2O3 to modify electrospun nylon nanofibers for filtration and product separation. Gong et al.124 used ALD and MLD coatings to modify polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS, a widely used material for many advanced applications such as microfluidic devices, microstructure replication, and soft lithography). They found that the ALD-Al2O3 coated PMDS changed from a hydrophilic surface to a hydrophobic surface, due to the oligomer outdiffusion from the polymer bulk onto the surface through cracks or other defects in the surface coating layer. In other words, the ALD Al2O3 coating could not sustain favorable wetting characteristics for extended periods of >48 hours. Using a combination of ALD-Al2O3/MLD-alucone of TMA–GLY, however, the PMDS could remain a hydrophilic surface for 200 hours, indicating the multistep procedures are promising for controlling surface properties.


6.2.2. Mechanical properties. 
In a study conducted by Brown et al.99 multiple metalcones (two alucones from TMA–EG and TMA–GL, a titanicone from TiCl4–GL, and a zincone from DEZ–GL) and a nanolaminate of alucone–Al2O3 were deposited on MWCNTs in order to accomplish improved mechanical properties. The researchers noticed that the initiation of metalcone MLD films could grow directly on the MWCNTs without any functionalization pretreatment on the MWCNTs. This is consistent to the observation of Chen et al.144 Their study showed that MLD and MLD–ALD coatings could dramatically improve the mechanical properties of MWCNTs, i.e., modest improvements in their ultimate tensile strength and significant improvement in their Young's modulus by a factor that ranges from 4.3 (for the alucone from TMA–GL) to 13.5 (for the alucone from TMA–EG), in comparison to the untreated CNTs.
Miller et al.86 conducted an investigation of thermomechanical properties on two alucones grown from an AB MLD process of TAM–EG and an ABC MLD process of TMA–EA–MA, respectively. Miller et al.86 revealed that, for zero film stress, the elastic modulus of the AB and ABC alucone was about 36.8 and 13.2 GPa, respectively. Their Berkovich hardness was around 0.47 and 0.27 GPa, respectively. In another study performed by Seghete et al.148 the two alucones were investigated as sacrificial layers for air gaps in NEMS. The study revealed that oxygen plasma dry etching could not remove the alucones, due to the aluminum content in the films. In wet etching solutions, the ABC alucone could be removed by hydrochloric acid and its etching rate could be accurately controlled by the etching time and the solution concentration.
Nanolaminates or alloys are good media to combine two different materials for achieving improved properties. Using Al2O3 ALD of TMA–H2O and alucone MLD of TMA–EG, Lee et al.151 developed various nanolaminates (or alloys) of Al2O3:alucone at 135 °C. This strategy was demonstrated to be a tunable route for nanoscale films with controllable properties, in terms of refractive index, elastic modulus, and hardness (see Fig. 32).

6.2.3. Diffusion barriers. 
Aimed at developing flexible gas/vapor diffusion barriers, Jen et al.152 studied the nanolaminates of Al2O3:alucone with different cycle ratios from 1:1 to 6:1, using ALD-Al2O3 from TMA–H2O and MLD-alucone from TMA–EG at 135 °C. The various films were deposited on polyimide Kapton substrates. The results showed that excellent diffusion barrier properties could be achieved with the nanolaminate films with much better flexibility than pure ALD-Al2O3 films. In terms of critical tensile strain (CTS), the highest CTSs derived from the 1:1 and 3:1 nanolaminate films are ∼0.90% and ∼0.98%, respectively, which are much higher than the pure alucone and Al2O3 films in the range ∼0.5–0.6%. It was believed that the higher CTSs for the nanolaminates are due to higher cross-linking than the MLD-alucone and less brittleness than the ALD-Al2O3. In addition, Jen et al.152 also revealed that, for the water vapor transmission rate (WVTR) measured at 38 °C and 85% relative humidity, the 1:1 nanolaminate films yield the highest WVTR of ∼1 g per m2 per day, similar to the uncoated Kapton polymer substrate. On increasing the number of ALD Al2O3 cycles, the WVTR reached the instrument sensitivity limit of ∼10−4 g per m2 per day for the 7:2, 5:1, and 6:1 nanolaminate films. The lower WVTR is attributed to a higher density and increased cross-linking in the nanolaminates with a larger fraction of Al2O3 inorganic constituent.
Ghazaryan et al.204 also made a comprehensive study on the stability of alucone films (from TMA and EG) and alucone alloys (consisting of alucone and Al2O3). They confirmed that combining MLD alucone with ALD Al2O3 is a facile and viable route for precisely tuning film refractive indexes. Ghazaryan et al.204 revealed that, exposed in air, the thickness of the alucone films decreased continuously with decreased rates in the first three days, accounting for a 25% reduction in total, and then had no more changes with aging time. In contrast, the change of the exposed alucone films in the refractive index was relatively small. Ghazaryan et al.204 confirmed that the water penetration is the only reason for the changes of the alucone films, for there were no changes with the alucone films remaining in dry air. They also verified that a 20 nm capping layer of either SiO2 or Al2O3 could protect alucone films from decomposition related to the moisture. In particular, Ghazaryan et al.204 disclosed that alucone:Al2O3 alloys (i.e., nanolaminates) with the cycle ratio of 5:5 were stable over time. In other words, the inclusion of five cycles of Al2O3 (∼0.5 nm) is already sufficient to inhibit the decomposition of the alucone component. There are two mechanisms potentially related to the alucone deposition. Firstly, alumina is a well-known dehydrogenation and dehydration catalyst. The catalytic properties of AlOx may decompose the organic species of the alucone films and give rise to the porosity. On the other hand, the role of the water vapor is believed having taken a more significant role. The latter has been verified by various studies.149,204 As disclosed by Liang et al.149, Ghazaryan et al.204 confirmed that an annealing to 400 °C changed dense alucone films into porous films and removed carbon species. They further revealed that a 20 nm Al2O3 capping layer or nanolaminates of 20 nm alucone/10 nm Al2O3 would not be able to remain stable under thermal treatment, due to some gases produced.


6.2.4. Area selective MLD. 
Patterned organic thin films with submicrometer features are of great importance in applications such as nanoelectronics and optoelectronics. Area selective MLD presents a new approach for creating patterned organic films. Through applying octadecytrichlorosilane (ODTS) self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) as a resist layer on SiO2 substrates, Bent et al.141 demonstrated that the SAMs could block the growth of the PD–ED MLD. The silane head groups of ODTS react with and eliminate –OH groups on the SiO2 surface. The resultant densely packed SAM film then prevents PD from reaching the SiO2 surface. Using the ODTS SAMs to create different patterns and then applying the PD–ED MLD, therefore, area selective MLD could be realized on the exposed areas. Instead of ODTS, Bent et al.142,143 in their following studies used octadecylphosphonic acid (ODPA) to perform area selective MLD on Cu and SiO2 substrates. Different from ODTS, ODPA can form a well-packed layer on surfaces of copper in a variety of states, i.e., Cu, CuO, and CuO2. In contrast, ODPA cannot chemically absorb on SiO2 surfaces, due to the high activation barrier between the head groups of phosphonic acid and SiO2 surfaces at room temperature. This can only be realized at elevated temperatures over 140 °C. As a consequence, as illustrated in Fig. 33, Bent et al. made use of this intrinsically selective adsorption of ODPA SAMs on Cu over SiO2 for patterning metal–dielectric substrates to prevent deposition by MLD or ALD on the metal surface, while letting the MLD or ALD film grow naturally on the dielectric regions.

6.3. Energy conversion and storage
Renewable clean energies (such as solar radiation and wind power) are essential for addressing and replacing the quickly depleting fossil fuels (i.e., oil, coal, and natural gas) to power our societies in the future.205 In doing so, energy conversion and storage devices are essential, such as rechargeable secondary batteries, supercapacitors, solar cells, and water splitting devices.

6.3.1. Rechargeable secondary batteries. 
Batteries as electrical energy storage (EES) devices are critical for wide implementation of the renewable clean energies,206 given the intermittent operation nature of solar and wind power. To date lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) represent the most successful EES devices and are dominant in portable electronics such as laptops, cell phones, and many others. However, LIBs are still not sufficient for transportation in terms of energy density, stability, cost, and safety.206 In addressing these challenges, ALD has emerged as a new research thrust and shown strong potential,27,30 exhibiting great capabilities in designing novel electrodes, solid-state electrolytes, and surface coatings for LIBs. Recently, there have been new efforts in ALD for other advanced battery systems such as lithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries,172,207,208 sodium-ion batteries,34,209 and lithium–air batteries.210 Along with the expanding applications of ALD in developing high-performance battery systems, MLD recently appeared as a new tool for addressing issues in LIBs.122 More recently, there have also been new efforts154,211 in using MLD for developing new advanced battery technologies beyond LIBs, such as lithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries. The capabilities of MLD for various batteries to date are exhibited in two aspects: (i) surface coatings of electrodes and (ii) electrode designs.
6.3.1.1. Surface coatings. 
The direct contact between LIB electrodes (i.e., anodes or cathodes) and liquid electrolytes always produces a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), which consists of decomposed products of electrolytes and lithium. It is important to secure a stable layer of SEI for reliable cyclability of LIBs. Previous studies, as reviewed by Meng et al.30 have demonstrated ALD as a viable technique to modify electrodes with an ultrathin inorganic coating (such as Al2O3, TiO2, and ZrO2 with a thickness of less than 1 nm in most cases) as an artificial SEI film to improve the stability and sustainable capacities of LIBs. MLD's capabilities for polymers prompted researchers to search for new surface coatings as SEI films in LIBs.
An earlier attempt by Leobl et al.153 comparatively investigated the effects of both ALD Al2O3 (using TMA and water) and MLD alucone (using TMA and EG) coatings in suppressing SEI formation and improving sustainable capacities of a LIB carbon anode. Their study disclosed that the ALD Al2O3 coatings performed much better than the MLD alucone coatings, in terms of reducing irreversible capacity and sustaining high reversible capacities. In comparison to the ALD coated LIB cells and the uncoated LIB cells, the MLD coated cells showed a worsened electrochemical performance. Leobl et al.153 believed that the poorer ionic transport through the thicker MLD alucone coatings, in contrast to the better ionic transport through the thinner ALD Al2O3 coatings, underlies the worsened performance of the MLD coated LIB cells.
Si is a very promising anode material and features an extremely high capacity of 3579 mA h g−1 theoretically at room temperature, nearly ten times higher than that of graphite anode materials (372 mA h g−1 theoretically).212,213 In contrast to little volume change of intercalation-based graphite anodes, Si is a kind of alloy/de-alloy-based anodes and experiences a huge volume change of ∼300% during charge–discharge processes of LIBs.212,213 The large volume change of Si brings many issues in LIBs and leads to electrochemical degradation and cell failure ultimately. To overcome this challenge, surface coating has been confirmed being effective to maintain mechanical integration of Si anodes, eliminate SEI formation, and therefore boost their electrochemical performance. To this end, several ALD coatings have been investigated, such as Al2O3 (ref. 214–216) and TiO2 (ref. 217). However, these metal oxide coatings lack flexibility with large volume expansion and contraction, and their ability to sustain long-term reliable cyclability of Si anodes is questionable. Piper et al.158 recently utilized a MLD coating of alucone (denoted as AlGL, using TMA and GL using as precursors at 140 °C) on Si anodes. Different from the rigid inorganic coatings, the organic–inorganic hybrid alucone coating features mechanical robustness and high flexibility. In particular, the MLD capability in coating high-aspect-ratio structures enables a conformal coating over prefabricated Si anodes consisting of tortuous structures (see Fig. 34). Consequently, Piper et al.158 confirmed that the MLD-AlGL coated nano-Si anodes could realize high performance, in terms of sustainable capacity, cyclability, and coulombic efficiency. It is further disclosed that the AlGL coating helps preserve the electrode network, accounting for a 17.5% volume increase after 20 electrochemical cycles for the coated electrode while it's a 50% volume increase for the bare electrode. The larger volume change with the bare electrode led to loss of fundamental particle contact and structural integrity, and therefore rapid degradation. Thus, AlGL proves to be robust and resilient enough to accommodate the extreme volumetric changes of the Si nanocomposite electrodes, helping maintain an intimately linked conductive network and allowing for faster ionic and electronic conduction.

Beyond LIBs, there are also new battery systems under development, such as lithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries and lithium–oxygen (Li–O2) batteries.218,219 These new batteries have much higher energy densities over LIBs. For example, Li–S batteries have an energy density of 2500 W h kg−1, 5–10 times over those of LIBs.218 However, Li–S batteries are also suffering from several big challenges. One of the challenges is the shuttling effect of dissoluble polysulfides (Li2Sn, n ≥ 4, which are the intermediate products during charge and discharge of Li–S batteries). Various ALD surface coatings have been confirmed being effective in mitigating the shuttle phenomenon such as Al2O3.220,221 Motivated by MLD organic–inorganic polymers' exceptional properties in flexibility and toughness, Li et al.154 applied MLD alucone (using TMA and EG) on prefabricated S cathodes (see Fig. 35a) and verified that the MLD modified S cathodes performed much better than uncoated S cathodes in an ether based electrolyte (1 M LiTFSI salt dissolved in dioxolane (DOL):dimethoxyethane (DME) of 1:1 volume ratio). As illustrated in Fig. 35b, all the coated S cathodes show significant improvement in both cyclability and coulombic efficiency. In particular, the S cathode coated with 5-cycle MLD alucone could accomplish a discharge capacity of 710 mA h g−1 after 100 discharge–charge cycles, two times higher than that of the uncoated bare C/S cathode. On the other hand, all the MLD alucone-coated S cathodes achieved a coulombic efficiency over 90%, in comparison to 70–80% of the bare C/S cathode. With respect to 5-cycle MLD alucone coating, a coating less than 5 cycles was insufficient to protect S from shuttling while a coating more than 5 cycles impeded S utilization with increased cell impedance. Thus, either of the two cases was not desirable for Li–S batteries. Furthermore, Li et al.154 also demonstrated that the MLD alucone coatings performed better than ALD Al2O3 for achieving higher electrochemical performance (see Fig. 35c). It has been well recognized that traditional carbonate electrolytes in LIBs are not suitable for Li–S batteries. In their subsequent study, Li et al.211 further confirmed that the alucone AlEG coating enables the reversible charge–discharge cyclability of Li–S batteries in carbonate electrolytes at the high temperature of 55 °C. All these provide new avenues for accomplishing high-performance new battery systems.

6.3.1.2. Electrode designs. 
In addition to surface coatings via MLD as well as ALD, recently there have been encouraging attempts at using MLD for novel electrode designs. Nisula and Karppinen115 investigated the electrochemical performance of MLD-deposited LTP thin films in lithium-ion microbatteries. Due to the dissolution and instability of the LTP films in liquid electrolytes, Nisula and Karppinen115 deposited a layer of a solid state electrolyte of LiPON (lithium phosphorous oxynitride) to shield the LTP films from directly contacting liquid electrolytes. In the voltage range of 0.4–3.00 V, The LiPON-coated LTP films exhibited exceptional performance, accounting for a coulombic efficiency of 99.7% and an 81.8% sustainable capacity after 500 cycles at a current rate of 6.4C.
Van de Kerckhove et al.103 deposited titanicone films using TDMAT and GL. They further treated the films under different conditions using water, annealing in air, and annealing in helium (He), leading to TiO2 films. Their subsequent electrochemical testing confirmed that the untreated titanicone films showed no electrochemical behaviors, while all other treatment-resultant TiO2 films exhibited electrochemical characteristics of TiO2. Among the treated films, the sample annealed in helium up to 500 °C showed the most promising performance, for the treatment in helium remained all the carbon species but the other treatments removed all the C species. In a following work, Van de Kerckhove et al.107 developed a new metalcone, vanadicone using TEMAV and GL as the MLD precursors. The resultant vanadicone films did not show any electrochemical behaviors in LIBs. Post-treated in air or a He atmosphere at 500 °C, the vanadicone films then exhibited distinct electrochemical performance as LIB cathodes. The vanadicone films annealed in He outperformed the ones treated in air, for they retained most of their carbon species.


6.3.2. Supercapacitors. 
Supercapacitors are another type of the promising EES devices,222 but differ from batteries in the energy storage mechanism. Through coating graphene with MLD-polyimide of PMDA–DDE and then carbonizing the resultant polyimide-graphene at 700 °C, Chen et al.137 developed nitrogen-doped carbon films (NC) on graphene. Chen et al.137 found that the pyrolysis-induced NC-graphene has larger surface areas over pristine graphene, accounting for 740 m2 g−1 (60-cycle MLD cycles of polyimide on graphene after pyrolysis, i.e., 60NC-graphene) versus 510 m2 g−1 of the pristine graphene, for the resultant NC films were introduced into a large amount of micropores. Using the NC-coated graphene as electrodes in supercapacitors, Chen et al.137 disclosed that the 60NC-graphene shows the best performance over the other NC-graphene and pristine graphene samples, in terms of capacitance and cyclability. After 5000 cycles, the 60NC-graphene still sustains 94.7% of the initial capacitance. Chen et al.137 believed that thinner NC films result in less pseudo-capacitance while thicker NC films lead to increased resistance for ion transportation. The latter was confirmed by impedance measurements.


6.3.3. Solar cells. 
Solar cells are an energy conversion device converting solar radiation into electricity.223 Of several different technologies of solar cells, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are very promising, featuring low cost, high efficiency, and good response to low-intensity light.224 In DSSCs, Pt, one expensive eletrocatalyst is generally used to promote the charge transfer rate for electrolyte reduction. Of potential alternatives to Pt, PEDOT is very beneficial with high electrical conductivity, electrocatalytic activity, and chemical stability. Using oMLD with the precursors of MoCl5 and EDOT, Kim et al.76 infiltrated ultrathin and conformal PEDOT films into highly conductive mesoporous indium doped oxide (m-ITO) (see Fig. 36a–d), and then evaluated its performance as an electrocatalytic cathode in DSCC devices. Using only ∼20 nm thick PEDOT films on m-ITO, an overall conversion efficiency of 7.18% was achieved, comparable to 7.26% of conventional Pt (see Fig. 36e and f). This work demonstrated that oMLD offers a viable route for designing Pt-free cathodes in DSCCs, featuring low cost and effective catalysis.

6.3.4. Water splitting. 
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting, first reported in the early 1970s,225 has been attracting much attention for large-scale production of hydrogen to supply clean energy using solar radiation. The PEC cells typically consist of metal oxides as the photoelectrode and noble metals as the auxiliary electrode. The n-type vertically oriented TiO2 nanotube arrays (TNTAs) via electrochemical anodization are one typical type of photoanodes, having highly controllable high-aspect-ratio structures and high surface area, and high light adsorption efficiency. Even so, the overall water splitting efficiency of TNTA photoanodes is far from reaching its theoretical maximum efficiency. The reasons include the poor spectral response of the wide band-gap TNTAs in visible light and the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics. Consequently, studies have been conducted to modify TNTAs for water splitting. In addressing the issues of TNTAs in water splitting, Tong et al.226 applied a MLD process of polyimides (using PMDA and EDA as the precursors) on TNTAs for 10 cycles and then the resultant core–shell TNTA@polyimide structures were carbonized in a H2/Ar atmosphere (see Fig. 37). The carbonization converted the polyimide film and TiO2 into N-doped carbon film and hydrogenated TiO2 (H–TiO2), respectively. In comparison to pristine TiO2 and H–TiO2 photoelectrodes, as disclosed by Tong et al.226 the core–shell H–TiO2@N-doped carbon coating performed much better. Specifically, the core–shell H–TiO2@N-doped carbon coating has the highest photocurrent density of 3.6 mA cm−2, 1.6 times larger than that of the H–TiO2 electrode and 5.4 times larger than that of the pristine TiO2. Tong et al.226 believed that the thin carbon film benefits the charge transport in TNTAs. In addition, the formed core–shell nanostructures also improve the separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs due to the existence of a heterojunction interface. Furthermore, hydrogenation extends the absorption spectrum from UV to visible light. In particular, the highly active N-doped carbon film greatly improves the kinetics of PEC water splitting and leads to the applied potential required for driving photo-assisted water splitting to shift cathodically by 100 mV. This combination of enhanced photocatalytic activity and photostability makes the ultrathin N-doped carbon film coating a promising strategy in the PEC water splitting for TNTAs or other porous semiconductors.

6.4. Catalysis

6.4.1. Exceptional photocatalytic activities. 
Since 1972, TiO2 has been the most widely investigated photocatalytic material.227,228 Based on MLD processes for hybrid organic–inorganic materials, recent studies have developed some new structures of TiO2 showing excellent performance. Using TiCl4 and EG as precursors, Ishchuk et al.174 developed the titanicone TiEG films (with a GPC of 4.5–6.0 Å per cycle in the range of 100–120 °C). Applying thermal treatment on the TiEG films for 30 min at different temperatures in air, Ishchuk et al.174 revealed that the TiEG films gradually change from amorphous (250 °C) to amorphous–crystalline (650 °C) and anatase phase (850 °C) of TiO2. Annealing the ALD TiO2 films (using TiCl4 and water as precursors) at 650 °C and 850 °C, in contrast, there are the brookite and rutile phases observed, in addition to the main anatase phase. Thus, Ishchuk et al.174 postulated that the presence of carbon in the TiEG films has suppressed the anatase-to-rutile phase transition. In their subsequent photocatalytic investigation based on porphyrin adsorption and photodegradation, Ishchuk et al.174 discovered that the amorphous–crystalline mixed phase of the TiEG titanicone (annealed at 650 °C) exhibited exceptional photocatalytic activity over the amorphous and crystalline TiEG, and was 5 times higher than that of TiO2 prepared by ALD for optimal conditions. The reason lies in the films of the mixed phase combining accessible adsorption sites and photocatalytic active crystalline regions. In other words, the photocatalytic activity is enhanced by the crystalline regions embedded within the amorphous film and capacity of the film volume to interact with the adsorbed molecules. This study offers a new strategy for designing new materials with enhanced photocatalysis.
In a subsequent work by the same group using the MLD process of TiEG, Sarkar et al.121 did a systematic study on designing TiO2 with oxygen vacancies (OVs), i.e., TiO2−δ (δ denotes the deviation from ideal oxide stoichiometry). In comparison to stoichiometric MOs, oxygen vacancies (OVs) affect their photocatalytic performance. OVs can change the reactivity of MOs by introduction of new electronic states in the materials' band gap and alternation of the electronic structure. OVs also often serve as adsorption sites for heterogeneous catalysis. Thus, OVs offer a feasible strategy for optimizing the MO electronic structure. Sarkar et al.121 found that the organic components of the TiEG hybrid films decompose during the thermal treatment, featuring a gradual and manageable evolution of the metastable hybrid films to the respective TiO2−δ thin films (see Fig. 38a). Consequently, Sarkar et al.121 demonstrated significant tuning of the electronic properties including the introduction of defect states and shifting the band positions. Specifically, the TiEG films annealed at 520 °C exhibit shallow defect states (located between the conduction band and the gold Fermi level) with improvement in the overall kinetics of electron transfer and thereby enhance the photocatalytic production of H2O2. The TiEG films annealed at 650 °C, on the other hand, are highly related to the deep valence band and show high reactivity to terephthalic acid (TPA) (see Fig. 38b).

Copyright (2016) American Chemical Society. 
Based on organic–inorganic hybrid films from MLD processes, there are some other studies to remove the organic component for producing porous inorganic films. Using the four-step MLD process of TiCl4–EA–MC–EA, Chen et al.105 deposited titanicone films on carbon nanocoils (CNCs). Annealed in a H2/Ar atmosphere at 600 °C for 2 h, the titanicone films converted into porous inorganic TiO2 films. They also verified that annealing in air under the same conditions produced no porous films, for TiO2 nanoparticles are prone to aggregate through Ostwald ripening at high temperatures and this leads to the collapse of the pore structures. While annealing in a H2/Ar atmosphere, the porous structure of the TiO2 films could be sustained at high temperatures, possibly due to the generation of amorphous carbon on the TiO2 surface by decomposition of the organic component. The amorphous carbon can prevent the aggregation of TiO2 at high temperatures. Chen et al.105 confirmed that, after annealing in H2/Ar, the resulting core–shell structure is the porous N-doped TiO2/CNCs. In the study, the photocatalytic activities of the porous N-doped TiO2/CNTs with a varying MLD cycle number were evaluated using the photodegradation of methylene blue (MB) under visible light irradiation (λ ≥ 420 nm). They disclosed that, in terms of photodegradation, the N-doped TiO2/CNCs can be improved in their photocatalytic activities by removing amorphous carbon at various temperatures in air and 350 °C is the optimal temperature for achieving the best catalytic efficiency, resulting in the highest specific surface area. Furthermore, the N-doped TiO2/CNCs could be further optimized in their catalytic activities by adjusting the MLD cycles, showing 200 cycles being the most efficient thickness. In comparison to undoped TiO2/CNCs via ALD using TiCl4 and water as precursors, the photocatalytic activity of the N-doped TiO2/CNCs is much higher. Under ultraviolet light (λ = 365 nm) irradiation, the N-doped TiO2/CNCs is even higher.


6.4.2. Catalyst stabilization. 
6.4.2.1. Porous overlayers. 
The deactivation of catalysts has been a ubiquitous but notorious issue in various catalytic processes and can be caused by many different mechanisms,229 such as poisoning, coking and fouling, sintering, attrition, and so on. Thus, it is important to stabilize catalysts for an extended lifetime. In this regard, ALD has shown being highly effective by depositing a thin overlayer to encapsulate catalysts on their supports.230 However, a dense and pinhole-free ALD coating may reduce the catalysts' activity. Attempting to address this, Liang et al.203 first reported a porous coating via MLD over the ALD-deposited 2 nm Pt catalysts supported by mesoporous silica particles. Liang et al.203 firstly coated the catalyst particles with alucone MLD films (using TMA and EG as precursors) at 160 °C, and then they oxidized the alucone films at 400 °C in air, resulting in porous alumina films (∼1, 2, 3, and 4 nm). Liang et al.203 studied the effects of the resultant porous alumina on the thermal stability of the Pt particles at 400, 600, and 800 °C. They revealed that, in comparison to the dramatically reduced dispersion of the pristine catalyst samples with increased temperatures, the porous alumina overlayer significantly reduces the sintering rate of Pt particles, particularly for thicker alumina films. The reactivity of the catalysts was evaluated using CO oxidation. Liang et al.203 found that the alumina-coated Pt nanoparticles were less catalytically active. A few of reasons may be responsible to the reduced reactivity of Pt: (i) the reduced pore size of the silica support and thereby the reduced mass transfer, and (ii) the reduced mass transfer due to the 0.6 nm pores of the alumina films.
Given the small pores of 0.6 nm of the porous alumina films from the TMA–EG MLD process, in another work by Gould et al.161 a porous alumina overlayer was formed on 5 nm supported Ni catalysts using the ABC MLD process of TMA–EA–MA for methane reforming. Methane (CH4) is the primary component of natural gas and dry reforming of methane (DRM) is an important process for conversion of CH4 to higher value products.231 One of the most used catalysts for methane reforming is Ni but suffers from coking and sintering. This ABC MLD process can create alucone films with a higher fraction of organic moieties and this was confirmed being effective in accomplishing larger pores of 0.8 nm in porous alumina films after calcination. By adjustably selecting calcination temperatures and MLD cycles, Gould et al.161 confirmed that the optimal porous alumina films can dramatically improve the DRM catalytic behavior and stability of the Ni catalysts under high-temperature reforming conditions.
6.4.2.2. Tunable composites. 
In improving catalysts' stability and efficiency, there apparently are other strategies, for instance, using metal oxides as additives to form composite catalysts. Copper-based catalysts have a wide range of applications such as decomposition, steam reforming, and synthesis of methanol.232,233 Cu–ZnO is one of such composite catalysts and has been widely investigated. ZnO may play important roles in two aspects:108 (i) ZnO nanoparticles function as a physical spacer between Cu nanoparticles and therefore help improve the dispersion of Cu during preparation, and (ii) the interaction of Cu and ZnO leads to an increase of intrinsic activity of Cu-based catalysts, an effect known as the Cu–ZnO synergy. Recently, Zhang et al.108 used a four-step ABCB MLD process of DEZ–PD–EDA–PD to coat CNT-supported Cu nanoparticles (i.e., Cu/CNTs) (see Fig. 39a). Zhang et al. verified that the MLD process can coat the Cu/CNTs uniformly (see Fig. 39b–A). Applying calcination at 300 °C in air for 2 h, there are a uniform dispersion of CuO and ZnO nanoparticles on the CNTs (see Fig. 39b–B). A subsequent reduction in H2/N2 resulted in ∼6 nm nanoparticles of Cu–ZnO on CNTs (see Fig. 39b–C). High resolution TEM (HRTEM) disclosed the microstructure of the Cu–ZnO interface (see Fig. 39b–D), in which the interplanar spacing of 0.21 and 0.25 nm matches well with the (111) plane of Cu0 and (101) plane of ZnO, respectively. In contrast, the Cu0 nanoparticles of reduced Cu/CNTs catalyst have a broad size distribution ranging from 2 to 300 nm. Thus, it was believed that the ZnO nanoparticles via the MLD strategy must have interacted with CuO nanoparticles and prevented the agglomeration of Cu0 nanoparticles. This promoted the generation of Cu–ZnO interface during reduction. As an alternative strategy, ALD-ZnO (using DEZ and water as precursors) has been coated on Cu/CNTs and the ZnO nanoparticles are in the range 11–18 nm after the reduction of ALD-coated Cu/CNTs. The catalytic activity of the Cu–ZnO catalysts were investigated and results revealed that the Cu–ZnO/CNTs via MLD exhibits remarkably enhanced selectivity, efficiency, and stability (see Fig. 39c) due to the created Cu–ZnO interface sites (Cu0Zn) and the cooperative effect between Cu0Zn and Cu+.

Based on the above discussions, apparently MLD provides multiple strategies for achieving high-performance catalysis, i.e., porous MO catalyst films, porous MO overlayers, and well-dispersed MO additives. All these together make MLD a very important tool for various catalytic processes.

6.5. Rewritable data storage
MLD processes also demonstrated promising applications in rewritable data storage. Yoshida et al.135,136 deposited a 6 nm polyimide using the MLD process of PDMA–DDE on Au substrates. Using a scanning probe microscope (SPM), they found that the conductivity of the MLD-resultant PDMA–DDE polyimide film can be changed by applying a voltage between the SPM probe and the film. In the forward scan at less than about 1.5 V the current value was very low and of the order of 10−11 to 10−9 A. This reveals that the as-deposited PMDA–DDE film exhibits a low conductive state. However, the current value sharply increased from ∼1.5 V and jumped up at ∼2.2 V in the forward scan. As a result, the PMDA–DDE film was transformed into a highly conductive state. This suggests that there is a threshold voltage for the conductivity transition at ∼1.5–2.2 V. This highly conductive state remained in the forward scan from 2.2 V and in the back scan. In the second scan of the negative voltage, the highly conductive state also remained. The current ratio of high to low conductive states at 0.2 V was about 104. The researchers also disclosed that the conductivity switching of the PMDA–DDE film is not dependent on the polarity of the voltage applied. Although the exact mechanism of the conductivity switching phenomenon is not fully clear, they believed that this conductivity-switching phenomenon is capable of providing rewritable data storage.
7. Conclusions
This work presents a comprehensive review on the technique of MLD, covering over 80 MLD processes for producing organic and organic–inorganic films. Analogous to ALD, MLD provides excellent uniform coverage over large-scale planar substrates and extreme conformal coatings over high-aspect-ratio complex structures. Exclusively for organic and organic–inorganic hybrid materials, MLD therefore is supplementary to ALD and enables an accurate control over material growth at the molecular level. ALD is particularly for inorganic materials with a growth preciseness at the atomic level. With the full capabilities of MLD and ALD, researchers are capable of developing new advanced materials with desirable properties.
As clearly discussed in the work, to date there have been a variety of MLD processes developed for organic and organic–inorganic materials. Given the fact that our society is facing many rigorous challenges in food, energy, health, and pollution, MLD is expected to offer new solutions with organic materials to address them, but the research on MLD to date is far more enough. Based on the studies summarized in this review, even so, it is encouraging that MLD are providing a number of new opportunities in many important applications and the studies on MLD is becoming more and more attractive. In case of new energies, rechargeable secondary batteries are one of the most successful technologies in electrochemistry and become essential for widely utilizing renewable clean energies (e.g., wind and solar power). In addressing the issues in LIBs and Li–S batteries, the recent studies154,158 clearly demonstrated that MLD-deposited organic–inorganic hybrid films have some exceptional properties in tailoring battery interfaces for improved battery performance. Furthermore, Nisula and Karppinen115 developed a lithium-containing organic material (i.e., LTP) as a new anode. These evidence MLD's capabilities in designing high-performance battery systems. In addition, MLD has shown promising applications in other energy devices including supercapacitors, solar cells, and water splitting. In the case of catalysis, MLD exhibits very novel and highly tunable abilities in designing high-efficient electrodes and stabilizing catalysts for extended lifetime. In the case of surface engineering, MLD paves an avenue to tune surface wettability, wearability, corrosion resistance, and so on. In case of novel nanostructured materials, MLD realizes many new materials and new structures that have not been reported. Through pyrolizing MLD deposited polymeric films, for example, Yang et al.173 demonstrated that MLD can synthesize CNTs in a more controllable mode. Moreover, there are other carbon-based composites and porous metal oxides reported. Besides the encouraging applications discussed in this review, there are also new research trends appearing in MOFs,112,113 organic magnets,116,117 luminescent materials,118,119 and so on. All these witness the significant roles played by MLD in searching for new materials for addressing challenges facing us. We would foresee that MLD, as well as its combination with ALD and other nanotechnologies, would greatly expand our capabilities in seeking new solutions for the four big problems of health, food, energy, and pollution.
Although all these exciting developments have been made with MLD, we should also realize that there are a number of new opportunities with MLD for future studies. In comparison to the large family of organic and organic–inorganic materials, first, the research on MLD is relatively undeveloped and more research efforts are needed. In energy storage, for instance, MLD to date is mainly used for surface modifications of battery electrodes. Research efforts of future MLD studies may further deliver new organic materials as electrodes and solid electrolytes to advance our pursuits in flexible and all-solid-state batteries234–236 with reliable safety, improved stability, low cost, and high energy. In surface engineering, MLD as well as its combination with ALD offers tremendous potential to develop advanced multifunctional materials enabling excellent corrosion resistance, low friction, high wearability, and tunable wettability.237 Second, MLD processes now are limited in satisfactory precursors. The ideal precursors should meet high volatility, high stability, and high reactivity. In particular, the precursors should be able to avoid double-end reactions. Third, the stability of the organic and organic–inorganic materials by MLD to date remains an issue, sensitive to air, humidity, and/or heat. In this regard, it will be very promising to expand MLD's applications with more robust materials. Last but not least, MLD to date is restricted to a limited range of applications. With the development of ideal MLD precursors and the improvement of resultant organic materials, we expect that the applications of MLD, in addition to those discussed in this review, will be greatly expanded into the areas of semiconductor,238 sensors,239 optics,240 biology,241 and medical242,243 and smart materials.244

 	Fig. 37  Schematic illustration of the fabrication of high-efficiency TNTA photoelectrodes of water splitting using a MLD process of polyimides:226 (a) Ti foil, (b) anodized TNTAs, (c) the MLD of polyimide on TNTAs, and (d) the ultrathin carbon coating/TNTA core/shell structure. Photons (hν) are absorbed by the sensitized film, producing electron–hole (e–h) pairs. The holes travel only short distances to reach the electrolyte. The electrons are conducted through the core material to the conducting substrate. Reprinted with permission from ref. 226. Copyright (2014) The Royal Society of Chemistry.
