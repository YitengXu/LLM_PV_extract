    , Accepted 27th April 2021First published on 28th April 2021AbstractTernary metal halides, including perovskites, have become a popular field of study over the last decade. Recently many groups have attempted to replace the lead in lead-based perovskites with other metals while retaining similar optical and electronic properties. While there are several candidates for lead replacement, copper-based ternary metal halides have arisen as some of the most interesting “perovskite-inspired” materials. Here we review the recent work on copper-based ternary metal halides, including all-inorganic and organic–inorganic hybrid, perovskite and non-perovskite, and ternary copper halides. We also discuss their photophysics and briefly compare these to copper-based double perovskites and other related compounds. This review mainly discusses the synthesis and properties of these materials as thin films, single crystals, nanomaterials, and microcrystalline powders, with a focus on their use in optoelectronic applications, including LEDs, solar cells, photodetectors, X-ray detectors, batteries, and other devices. Finally, we conclude with a perspective on the current issues facing the field, along with suggestions for future directions for this fascinating class of copper compounds.

1 Introduction
Metal–metal halides, and especially lead halide perovskites, have attracted tremendous research interest in the last few years owing to their outstanding optical absorption, low exciton binding energy, relatively long diffusion length of charge carriers, tunable band gap, and high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY).1–4 Thus, they have received great attention in optoelectronic applications including solar cells,5–7 light-emitting diodes,8–11 lasers,12,13 photodetectors,14 and scintillators.15,16 In spite of the significant progress that has been achieved in the fabrication of lead halide perovskites, the toxicity of lead and long-term stability of these materials limit their practical applications. Replacing the lead in lead halide perovskites with other elements, while retaining the favorable optoelectronic properties is of great significance and interest. Lead halide perovskites generally have an APbX3 crystal structure where A = Cs, methylammonium (MA), and formamidinium (FA) and X = Cl, Br, and/or I.
Early on there were efforts to replace toxic lead in a perovskite structure. Sn-Based perovskite NCs were first studied for the replacement of lead in CsPbX3 since they have a similar band gap and a similar ABX3 perovskite crystal structure.17,18 However, CsSnX3 NCs can easily oxidize from Sn2+ to Sn4+.17 Later, Bi3+ and Sb3+ were also studied but the PLQYs of the as-synthesized Cs3Bi2Br919 and Cs3Sb2Br920 were much lower than lead halides.1–4 Lead-free double-layer perovskite NCs were found to have significant potential to replace lead perovskites, where a pair of one monovalent ion and one trivalent ion such as Ag+/Bi3+, Ag+/Sb3+, and Ag+/In3+ replace two divalent Pb2+.21–24 Unfortunately, most published double-layer perovskite NCs possess indirect band gaps or poor optical properties for other reasons.21–24
Most recently, copper has become a favored candidate for replacing lead in the metal halide family because of its outstanding optoelectronic features, abundance, low price, and low environmental effect. Although no longer actually “perovskites”, alkali and organic copper halides retain some similar properties of the perovskite families previously studied and this field is often considered to be inspired or derived from the general field of metal halide perovskites. Over the last few years, copper-based halides with different compositions and structures have been broadly studied in a variety of shapes, sizes and for various applications. In this review, we summarize the recent progress in the development of copper-based halides in bulk and nanocrystal forms, with a particular focus on the crystal structures, synthesis methods, and optical properties of ternary copper halides and we discuss their applications in optoelectronic devices, as shown in Fig. 1. Furthermore, we suggest future research directions with the aim of inspiring future research interests and developing a few potential applications.

2 Alkali copper halides
2.1 Crystal structures
Unlike lead-based perovskites, copper halides possess a wide range of structures and compositions. The possible different ratios of alkali and halogen elements and the two valences of copper provide a large degree of variation for the chemical compositions of alkali copper halides. Hull et al.25 studied the crystal structures of ternary copper(I) halides in 2004. The representative structures of four different types of ternary copper halides are shown in Fig. 2. Cs3Cu2X5 crystallizes in the orthorhombic space group of Pnma.25 The typical structural model of Cs3Cu2I5 is shown in Fig. 2a. There are a tetrahedral site and a trigonal site in this crystal, each of them forms [Cu2I5]3− and each [Cu2I5]3− is isolated by Cs+ ions. It was also suggested that Cs3Cu2Cl5 could crystallize in the space group of Cmcm, which is in accordance with the X-ray diffraction (XRD) result of Li et al.26 The Cu+ ions are disordered over two sites which are tetrahedrally coordinated to Cl−.25 The different structures may be the origin of the ultra-high PLQY (∼100%) bright green emission and the significant long lifetime for Cs3Cu2Cl5 as compared with Cs3Cu2Br5 and Cs3Cu2I5.26 CsCu2X3 (X = Cl, Br, and I) adopts an orthorhombic space group of Cmcm (Fig. 2b). The 1D ribbon-like crystal structure features edge-sharing [Cu2X3]− anionic chains separated by rows of Cs+ atoms. The unique optical properties of this family are attributed to the 1D chain structure.27 A2CuX3 (A = K, Rb; X = Cl, Br)28,29 are isostructural compounds, that belong to the orthorhombic space group of Pnma (Fig. 2c). The anionic 1D 1∞[CuX]2− chains are made of corner-sharing [CuX4] tetrahedra extending along the b axis, and the chains are separated by K+ and Rb+ cations, respectively. Cs2CuX4 (X = Cl, Br) also crystallizes in an orthorhombic crystal structure of the space group Pnma (Fig. 2d), while Cs2CuCl3Br possesses a tetragonal arrangement (I4/mmm), in which the incorporation of Br atoms leads to distortion of the [CuCl6]4− octahedron, thus changing the Cu2+ environment. The changes of Cu2+ environment are strongly related to the magnetic properties of the mixed halide compounds.30,31 Since there are many compositions of alkali copper halides, and Cu+ is easy to be oxidized to Cu2+, further study of the crystallographic stability and the relationship between the crystal structure, oxidation states and optical features of compounds is of great importance.

2.2 Cesium copper halides

2.2.1 Bulk form: single crystals, polycrystalline powders and thin films. 
Copper-based halides have attracted great attention due to the abundance, low cost and non-toxicity of copper and are available in a wide array of structures and material types, including powders, single crystals, polycrystalline thin films, microcrystals, and nanocrystals of various shapes and sizes. As an example, Cu(II)-based halide compounds such as Cs2CuX4 (X = Cl, Br, and Cl/Br) have been well-studied for their electronic and magnetic properties.30–33 In 2016, Cortecchia et al. reported the successful synthesis of MA2CuClxBr4−x powder and the fabrication of films via spontaneous crystallization and spin-coating method and illustrate their potential in photovoltaic applications.34 Monovalent Cu(I)-based halide compounds were also well studied though these compounds possess Cu-halide tetrahedra instead of the octahedra common to perovskites, giving rise to even more structural isomers for each composition.
Bulk form cesium copper halides, including single crystals, polycrystalline powders and thin films, can be synthesized by the following methods. The antisolvent vapor-assisted crystallization method, also called the antisolvent infiltration method, can be used to grow single crystals and is based on the different solubilities of metal halide precursors in various solvents, as shown in Fig. 3a.35 The slow diffusion of the antisolvent vapor into a saturated precursor solution helps to form single crystals but requires several days for large crystals to form. The inverse temperature crystallization (ITC) method can also be used to synthesize single crystals when metal halides are less soluble at higher temperatures, the property of inverse solubility, as occurs in certain solvents.36 This method is simpler and faster than the antisolvent infiltration method. Conversely, the low-temperature crystallization method is based on the decreasing solubility of metal halide precursors in certain solvents when temperature decreases slowly or naturally, as shown in Fig. 3b.37 Usually, saturated metal halide precursors solution is first prepared at high temperature, then single crystals start to grow when the temperature of the precursor solution decreases slowly or naturally. The solvent evaporation method of crystallization, perhaps the most traditional method of crystal production, can also be used to synthesize single crystals, as shown in Fig. 3c.38 There, the solvents of the metal halide precursors solution evaporate naturally to lead to the growth of single crystals.

Polycrystalline powders can be synthesized by ball milling methods and by high-temperature sintering techniques. In these methods, stoichiometric precursors can be easily adjusted according to the desired metal halide compound compositions. The ball milling method can be considered as a green synthesis method, as it is carried out at room temperature without using any organic solvents.39 Although high-temperature sintering solid-state technique requires high temperature, it has also been shown to be an efficient and useful method for the synthesis of metal-doping metal halides.40
The most commonly used conventional method to fabricate metal halide thin films is spin-coating precursors which react to form thin films as the solvent evaporates.35 Antisolvent engineered spin-coating methods can also be used to form metal halide thin films, as shown in Fig. 3d.41 In addition to the spin-coating method, vacuum deposition can also be applied to fabricate metal halide thin films with good morphology.39
2.2.1.1 Cs3Cu2X5 single crystals, polycrystalline powders and thin films. 
Of the many forms of ternary copper halides, A3Cu2X5 (A = alkali metal, X = halides) is one of the most commonly studied due to ease of synthesis, regular formation of crystalline materials and useful optical properties. Several forms of this material, including single crystals, thin films powders and nanocrystals have been identified. In 2018, Jun et al., for the first time, reported the synthesis of 0D Cs3Cu2I5 single crystal by an antisolvent infiltration method and fabricated Cs3Cu2I5 thin films by a spin-coating method, as shown in Fig. 4a.35 Cs3Cu2I5 single crystals were shown with a PL peak at 445 nm with a high PLQY of 90%, showing their potential in white light and blue LED applications.35

In 2020, Zhang et al. also reported the synthesis of Cs3Cu2I5 single crystals with a size larger than 5 mm via room temperature solvent evaporation crystallization method.38 Yuan et al. demonstrated a Tl-doped Cs3Cu2I5 single crystal synthesized by the vertical Bridgman method at 450 °C, as shown in Fig. 4b.42 This Cs3Cu2I5:Tl single crystal has a PL peak at 517 nm with a broadband emission, which covers the entire visible emission range. This is due to the synergetic effects of self-trapped excitons (STEs) and Tl-assisted emission by doping at Cs+ sites.42 It shows better light yield and higher energy resolution at 662 keV than that of the commercial scintillator NaI:Tl, indicating its possibly greater potential for scintillator applications.42 In 2019, Du et al. reported a series of novel Mn(II)-doped Cs3Cu2I5 thermochromic microparticles produced via a high-temperature solid-state method.40 The Mn(II)-doped Cs3Cu2I5 microparticles show not only 448 nm Cu+ emission but also a green emission peak at 556 nm from the transition of Mn2+ under the 300 nm photoexcitation. Interestingly, the ratio of the emission of Cu+ and Mn2+ ions is highly temperature-dependent from below room temperature up to 498 K.40 This Mn(II)-doped Cs3Cu2I5 along with blue phosphor BaMgAl10O12:Eu2+ were applied to a 378 nm UV chip to achieve white light emission.43
In addition to pure (single) halide compounds, Cs3Cu2X5 mixed halides compounds were also studied. Sebastia-Luna et al. reported the synthesis of Cs3Cu2X5 (X = Cl, Br, I, and mixed halide) polycrystalline powders by a simple solvent-free ball milling method.39 Although they reported impurities to be present, likely from zirconia debris originating from the grinding medium, the pure-halide Cs3Cu2X5 compounds still exhibited high PLQY in the blue-green region.39 The PL emission peaks showed a red shift when the halide anions were varied from I− to Cl−, with decreasing ionic radii, as shown in Fig. 4c. This is the opposite trend to the lead halide perovskite, whose PL originates from band to band radiative recombination, with PL peaks red-shifting when the halide elements change from Cl to I ions, in the direction of increasing ionic radius.2 For the Cs3Cu2X5, the PL emission is a consequence of STEs generated by the strong charge localization within the 0D structure, and thus independent of the (wide band gap) band edge trend.39 In addition to the ball milling method, Cs3Cu2X5 (X = Cl, Br, I, and mixed halides) polycrystalline powders can also be synthesized by a high-temperature solid-state method, which shows similar optical properties to those synthesized by other methods.44 Roccanova et al. also reported the synthesis of highly efficient blue-emitting 0D all-inorganic Cs3Cu2Br5−xIx (0 ≤ x ≤ 5) by the solid-state method.45 These Cs3Cu2Br5−xIx (0 ≤ x ≤ 5) polycrystalline powders show PL peaks varying from 443 nm to 456 nm, with high PLQYs over 50.1% and improved thermal and air stability compared to that of Pb- and Sn-based halides.45 The PL peaks range from light blue with CIE coordinates of (0.15, 0.067) for Cs3Cu2Br5 to deep blue (0.15, 0.048) for Cs3Cu2I5, which also display a liner blue-shift for Cs3Cu2Br5−xIx (0 ≤ x ≤ 5) polycrystalline powders, as shown in Fig. 4d.45 In 2020, Cs3Cu2Br1.07Cl3.93 polycrystalline powder was synthesized via a solid-state method.44 This material showed a PL peak at 483 nm, with a PLQY of 20%. Although the polycrystalline form of Cs3Cu2X5 (X = Cl, Br, and I) can be easily synthesized by the solid-state method, especially for the solvent-free ball milling method, its air stability was found to be rather poor compared to their single crystal form.35,44,45
Cs3Cu2I5 thin films can be fabricated by a simple one-step spin-coating method.35,39,46,47 Typically, clear solutions of CsI and CuI precursors are prepared using DMSO and DMF as mixed solvents. Then a thin film is formed by spin-coating the filtered solution and annealed at 70–100 °C in nitrogen. Cs3Cu2I5 thin films can also be fabricated by vacuum deposition. Cs3Cu2I5 thin films were also successfully fabricated by a single-source vacuum deposition (SSVD) method, showing higher PLQY and better morphology than the traditional spin-coating method, as shown in Fig. 4e.39 In 2020, Liu et al. reported the successful fabrication of Cs3Cu2I5 thin films via vacuum dual-source thermal deposition method. This Cs3Cu2I5 thin film shows a PL peak at 441 nm with PLQY of 58% and uniform surface (root mean square of 3.6 nm), achieving deep-blue LED applications.48
2.2.1.2 CsCu2X3 single crystals, polycrystalline powders and thin films. 
CsCu2X3 (X = Cl, Br, and I) are another well studied form of ternary copper halides. These materials show emission peaks located at the green to yellow regions, which is important for display and lighting applications. Although the PLQYs of these materials lag behind green emissive Cs3Cu2Cl5, their better ambient air stability makes them a possible candidate, among cesium copper halides, for display and lighting applications.
In 2019, Lin et al. synthesized a rod-shaped 1D CsCu2I3 single crystal with a size of about 10 mm × 1.5 mm via the antisolvent infiltration method, as shown in Fig. 5a.49 This CsCu2I3 single crystal has a PL peak at 567 nm with full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 75 nm and PLQY of 15.7%, showing its potential in white lighting application.49 CsCu2I3 single crystals can be also synthesized using the inverse temperature crystallization method.36

Reprinted with permission from ref. 50, Copyright 2020, American Chemical Society. 
CsCu2X3 (X = Cl, Br, and I) polycrystalline powders were synthesized by a solid-state method at 410 °C for 48 h.27 These CsCu2X3 (X = Cl, Br, and I) polycrystalline powders show PL peaks at 527 nm, 533 nm and 576 nm, with FWHM of 102 nm, 106 nm, 126 nm, as shown in Fig. 5b.27 These materials display PLQYs of 48%, 18.3%, 3.23% for CsCu2Cl3, CsCu2Br3, and CsCu2I3, respectively.27 These CsCu2X3 (X = Cl, Br, and I) polycrystalline powders have relatively short lifetimes of 13.8 ns (CsCu2Cl3), 18 ns (CsCu2Br3) and 62 ns (CsCu2I3) compared to that of Cs3Cu2X5 (X = Cl, Br, and I). The emission of these CsCu2X3 (X = Cl, Br, and I) polycrystalline powders is also attributed to STE.27 CsCu2X3 (X = Cl, Br, and I) polycrystalline powders can also be synthesized by a simple solvent-free ball milling method.39 CsCu2Br3 and CsCu2I3 showed good thermal stability without any weight variation until approximately 490 and 360 °C.39 In addition to single halides, CsCu2X3 mixed halides compounds have also been studied. CsCu2Cl1.5Br1.5 and CsCu2Br1.5I1.5 polycrystalline powders were reported by the solid-state method.27 These two CsCu2Cl1.5Br1.5 and CsCu2Br1.5I1.5 polycrystalline powders show PL peaks at 587 nm and 584 nm, with FWHM of 200 nm, 128 nm and PLQY of 0.37% and 0.38%. The CIE coordinates of their PL emission, along with CsCu2Cl3 and CsCu2I3, are located between the green and yellow visible region, as shown in Fig. 5c.27 CsCu2Cl2I polycrystalline powders were also synthesized by the solid-state method, showing PL peak at 554 nm with PLQY of 3.5%.44
In 2020, Yang et al. fabricated CsCu2I3 thin films by an antisolvent crystallization method using methyl acetate as the antisolvent.50 As shown in Fig. 5d, the SEM image shows that thin films made from CsCu2I3 microrods formed by an antisolvent crystallization method have sizes varying from several to tens of micrometers.50 This CsCu2I3 microrod thin film showed PL emission at 580 nm with a FWHM of 117 nm and PLQY of 12.3%. Owing to its good optical properties, outstanding moisture, thermal and ambient long-term stability, this CsCu2I3 thin film was successfully applied to photodetector applications.50 Ma et al. also reported the fabrication of CsCu2I3 thin films by an antisolvent crystallization method using toluene as the antisolvent.41 By adjusting the antisolvent dripping time, better morphology and luminous performance of CsCu2I3 thin film could be obtained and this was successfully demonstrated via an LED with yellow emission.41
Due to the similar composition of Cs, Cu, I elements and soft crystal structures, bulk forms of CsCu2I3 and Cs3Cu2I5 can be achieved by phase transformation. Jun et al. achieved white emitting thin films via a one-step spin coating method by using a mixed solution of CsCu2I3 and Cs3Cu2I5 with a ratio of 83:17, and showed a CIE coordinate of (0.33, 0.35).36 Ma et al. also used a facile one-step solution method to fabricate white emissive CsCu2I3 and Cs3Cu2I5 composite films, as shown in Fig. 6a, and achieved a stable, electrically-driven WLED with an EQE of 0.15%.51 Fang et al. reported transformations between CsCu2I3 and Cs3Cu2I5via a solvent-assisted grinding process, by the addition of CuI or CsI.52 Grandhi et al. also achieved a reversible phase transformation between the CsCu2I3 and Cs3Cu2I5 in the solid state, demonstrating the flexible structure of cesium copper halides, as shown in Fig. 6b.53

2.1.1.3 Other cesium copper halides. 
In addition to the above-mentioned CsCu2X3 and Cs3Cu2X5 cesium copper halides, a new polycrystalline mixed-halide compound of Cs5Cu3Cl6I2 was successfully synthesized by the solid-state method at 400 °C and also by a solution-phase synthesis method using acetonitrile as the solvent.44 This Cs5Cu3Cl6I2 belongs to the orthorhombic space group of Cmcm and consists of 1D zigzag chains of [Cu3Cl6I2]n5n− chains, which are composed of an alternating connected [CuCl2I2]2 units and a single [CuCl2I2] units, where only I− ions serve to bridge these units.44 The Cs5Cu3Cl6I2 exhibits bright blue emission of 462 nm with a near-unity quantum yield of 95% and displayed excellent long-term air stability.44


2.2.2 Nanocrystals (NCs). 
Colloidal nanocrystals (NCs), which are typically 2–20 nm in size, have many more favorable optical properties compared with their bulk counterparts because of their quantum-size effects, versatile surface chemistry, as well as their dispersion into different solvents and matrices for the fabrication of various devices.2 Thus, the synthesis of cesium copper halide NCs has gained a lot of attention. The size, shape, and composition of lead-based halide perovskite NCs have been broadly studied,54–57 however, shape and size control has not been thoroughly studied for copper halide compounds.
Hot injection and antisolvent recrystallization are two representative methods for the synthesis of colloidal lead halide perovskite NCs and can also be used to prepare copper halides. The hot-injection method is performed at high temperature under air-free conditions. Ideally the size of the as-synthesized NCs and their size distribution can be tuned by the reaction temperature.2 Cheng et al.58 firstly reported this approach to synthesize CsCu2I3 nanorods and Cs3Cu2X5 (X = Cl, Br, and I) NCs. Typically, NCs are obtained by quickly injecting the Cs-oleate precursor solution into octadecene containing CuX (X = Cl, Br, and I), oleylamine and oleic acid (Fig. 7a). Oleylamine and oleic acid are added into octadecene to solubilize CuX and to colloidally stabilize the NCs.

Copper-based halide NCs can also be prepared by the antisolvent recrystallization method and this method can be performed at room temperature in air. This is done by injecting the precursor from a good (polar) solvent to a poor (nonpolar) solvent under vigorous stirring. The mixture of the two solvents induces an instantaneous supersaturation, which triggers the nucleation and growth of the NCs (Fig. 7b). For example, in a typical synthesis of Cs3Cu2X5 NCs, CsX and CuX are dissolved in DMSO to form the precursor, then a certain amount of precursor solution is quickly injected into a mixture of toluene and OA under vigorous stirring.26
2.2.2.1 Cs3Cu2X5 (X = Cl, Br, and I) nanocrystals. 
The family of Cs3Cu2X5 (X = Cl, Br, and I) NCs were reported in 2019 for the first time. These NCs were synthesized via a hot-injection approach.58 The blue emissive Cs3Cu2I5 NCs have a PLQY of up to 67% with good stability in air, however, Cs3Cu2Br5 NCs have much lower PLQY (18.3%) and there are inevitable CsCl impurities in Cs3Cu2Cl5 NCs. The large Stokes shift, highly luminescent and broad emission are similar to Cs3Cu2I5 single crystals,35 which is attributed to STEs. Subsequently, Luo et al.59 reported the preparation of Cs3Cu2X5 (X = Cl, Br, and I) NCs possessing orthorhombic structures by injecting oleylammonium halide precursors into a solution of copper(II) acetate, cesium carbonate, oleic acid and 1-octadecene. The as-obtained Cs3Cu2Cl5 NCs display cubic-like shapes with edge lengths of 13 nm, while Cs3Cu2Br5 and Cs3Cu2I5 show rod-like morphology with an average size of 21 × 11 nm and 21 × 14 nm, respectively.59 Although Cs3Cu2I5 NCs reportedly retained outstanding PL stability after storage in ambient conditions for 45 days, the Cs3Cu2Br5 and Cs3Cu2Cl5 NCs produced using this method exhibited severe degradation.59 The NCs exhibited broad blue or green emission in the range of 445–527 nm, and the PLQY of Cs3Cu2Cl5 NCs is as high as 48.7%, while the PLQY of Cs3Cu2I5 NCs is only 29.2%, much lower than their bulk materials.35,45 The PLQY of Cs3Cu2I5 NCs is significantly enhanced with the assistance of indium iodide (InI3) for the synthesis of Cs3Cu2I5 NCs by a hot-injection method.60 Cs3Cu2I5 NCs with a high PLQY of 73.7% were obtained, and there is no obvious decrease in the PLQY for the sample kept in the air after 30 days.60 A reasonable explanation is that the addition of InI3 inhibits the growth of NCs, producing Cs3Cu2I5 NCs at a high temperature.60 The results show that the size of as-synthesized Cs3Cu2I5 NCs decreases with the increment of the amount of InI3, while there are no In3+ incorporated into the lattice of Cs3Cu2I5, and this method can also be applied to synthesize Cs3Cu2Br5 NCs and Cs3Cu2Cl5 NCs.60
In 2020, Li et al.26 reported a facile antisolvent recrystallization method to synthesize Cs3Cu2X5 (X = Cl, Cl/Br, Br, Br/I, and I) NCs at room temperature with a size less than 10 nm (Fig. 8a). These NCs showed excellent optical properties and PL emission in the region of 440–530 nm was obtained by compositional adjustment (Fig. 8c).26 The highest PLQY of ∼100% was achieved for Cs3Cu2Cl5 NCs, which is the highest value among the various all-inorganic green emissive ternary copper halides.26,27,39,44,59 The lifetimes (Fig. 8b) of these nanocrystals are very long (in the range of 0.12 to 98 μs), which is similar to their bulk counterparts.35,36,44 Additionally, they demonstrated that Cs3Cu2Cl5 NCs could also be used for inkjet printing, where the printed patterns exhibited good photoluminescence and stability under an ambient atmosphere.26 Cs3Cu2I5 NCs have also been used to fabricate deep-blue LEDs with an external quantum efficiency of ∼1.12%.61 Overall, these reports demonstrate the great potential for the use of cesium copper halide NCs in optoelectronic applications.

2.2.2.2 CsCu2X3 (X = Cl, Br, and I) nanocrystals. 
To the best of our knowledge, for the CsCu2X3 (X = Cl, Br, and I) phase, only CsCu2I3 NCs have been reported. Li et al. found that by simply changing the precursor concentration the blue emissive Cs3Cu2I5 and CsCu2I3 NCs could be produced by the same procedure.26 In addition, Cs3Cu2I5 NCs could transform into CsCu2I3 in polar solvents (Fig. 8d).26 Mixing of Cs3Cu2I5 and CsCu2I3 NCs in solution forms bright white emission under 254 nm UV light (Fig. 8e). CsCu2I3 is calculated to possess direct band gaps, and the band gap is smaller than that of Cs3Cu2I5.58 This result is in agreement with the fact that the absorption and emission bands of the Cs3Cu2I5 NCs blue shift.
2.2.2.3 Cs2CuX4 (X = Cl, Br, and Br/I) nanocrystals. 
Compared with Cu(I)-based ternary halide NCs, Cu(II)-based ternary halide NCs have attracted less attention due to their poorer optical properties. Cs2CuX4 (X = Cl, Br, and Br/I) NCs with blue-green luminescence were first reported in 2018.62 These NCs were synthesized by an improved antisolvent recrystallization method and exhibited spherical shapes (the typical appearance of NCs is shown in Fig. 9a), and their sizes and PL peaks can be tuned by halide composition and precursor ratios in the range of 385–504 nm (Fig. 9b and c). The highest PLQY value of 51.8% was reported for Cs2CuCl4 QDs.62 Cs2CuBr4 QDs show reasonable air stability, such that the PL intensity of Cs2CuBr4 QDs was reported to have decreased by only 8% of the initial value after being exposed to air for 1 month (Fig. 9e).62 Cs2CuI4 QDs were not obtained because of the instability and easy decomposition of pure copper(II) diiodide.62 Different from Cu(I)-based ternary halides, these Cs2CuX4 NCs have a normal PL shift with changing halide composition and significantly shorter lifetimes (Fig. 9d), which may be due to the different emission mechanism.26,58–62

2.2.2.4 Shape and size control of cesium copper halide nanocrystals. 
Controlling the shapes and sizes of NCs is a desirable way to improve the optical properties of the products, including emission wavelengths, emission anisotropy, PLQYs, and PL lifetimes.54–57 Therefore, NCs exhibiting specific features can be used for different optoelectronic applications. Size tuning and various shapes such as spherical quantum dots, nanocubes, nanorods, nanoplates, and nanowires have been reported for CsPbX3 NCs,54–57 while the development of the shape and size tunability of copper-based NCs remains in the early status. In general, most reactions based on either the hot injection or the antisolvent method tend to produce cubic or spherical like particles.26,60,61
Cheng et al.58 reported blue emissive 0D Cs3Cu2I5 NCs (Fig. 10a) and yellow emissive 1D CsCu2I3 NRs (Fig. 10b) using a hot-injection approach. There the different morphologies were simply controlled by changing reaction temperature and using the same precursor and ligands.58 The synthesis of Cs3Cu2I5 NCs and CsCu2I3 NRs are performed at 70 °C and 110 °C, respectively (Fig. 7a). However, the PLQY of CsCu2I3 NRs is much lower compared with Cs3Cu2I5 NCs, merely 5% can be achieved due to the lower structural dimensionality. Similarly, another report demonstrated that different morphologies of Cs3Cu2I5 nanoplates (43 nm) and CsCu2I3 nanorods (68 nm width, 201 nm length) can be produced by altering the reaction temperature and ligand ratios.63

CsCu2I3 nanowires were demonstrated using an antisolvent synthesis approach.64 Nanowires are prepared by dissolving precursors in acetonitrile and then slowly adding diethyl ether. The width and length of the nanowires can be controlled by the dropping speed of diethyl ether and the widths can range from the nanometer to the micrometer in size (Fig. 10d).64 Based on these CsCu2I3 nanowires, photodetectors with a high photocurrent anisotropy of 3.16 were also demonstrated.64
Booker et al. reported the morphology of Cs2CuCl4 nanoplates (NPs) with a Pnma space group and CsCuCl3 NPs with a Cmcm space group by using a modified hot-injection strategy.65 By changing the ratio of the coordinating ligands of OA to OLA in the reaction mixture, the compositions and morphologies of the as-synthesized NCs could be controlled.65 Specifically, dots with a variety of particle sizes (OA:OLA = 1:2, 1:4 and 4:1), nanorods with an average length of 1.2 μm (OA:OLA = 2:1), nanoplatelets with a 200 nm radius (OA:OLA = 2:2), and nanowires with length over 2 μm and a width of only 50 nm (OA:OLA = 4:4) were all synthesized and are as shown in Fig. 10e–j.65 These NPs exhibited broad PL between 400 and 650 nm upon excitation (Fig. 10k), however, there are no quantum-confinement effects since the emission is unaffected in all morphologies of NPs, indicating that the emission might be related to some extrinsic characters instead of the intrinsic band emission.65 Additionally, larger particles have the highest PLQYs, which is due to the luminescence originating from defects in the volume of the NP cores rather than on the surface.65
CsCuBr2 micro-crosses (MCs) were reported in 2019.66 A stable green-emitting CsCuBr2 micro-cross morphology (Fig. 10c) was obtained by recrystallizing Cs3Cu2Br5 microrods in DMF.66 Using this approach, MCs could be formed on top of a Si substrate forming a basic LED device configuration of Ag/CsCuBr2/p-Si/In-Ga which displayed EL emissions at 527 nm.66

2.3 Rubidium and potassium copper halides

2.3.1 Rubidium copper halides (Rb2CuX3, X = Cl, Br) single crystals, polycrystalline powders and nanocrystals. 
In addition to the cesium copper halides mentioned above, rubidium copper halides and potassium copper halides have also attracted some recent attention due to their deep blue emission, high PLQY, good air stability and potential for use in scintillator applications.
In 2019, Yang et al. successfully synthesized 1D structure rod-like Rb2CuBr3 single crystals with a diameter of 200 μm via the low-temperature crystallization method.37 The Rb2CuBr3 single crystal reported displayed a PL peak at 385 nm with a large Stokes shift of 85 nm and a high PLQY of 98.6%, as shown in Fig. 11a.37 Due to the soft nature of the crystal, strong exciton–phonon coupling exists in this compound, resulting in STE emission with a large stoke shift, similar to that of low-dimensional metal halide perovskites with STEs.37 The melting point of the Rb2CuBr3 single crystal was measured as 274 °C, which is much lower than that of the inorganic perovskite scintillators based on CsPbBr3.67 This could lead to lower-costs and energy consumption when processed into a thick film for large-area medical imaging. Owing to its high PLQY, negligible self-absorption from STEs and strong X-ray absorption capability, Rb2CuBr3 single crystals also showed great potential for scintillator applications.37 Zhao et al. reported Rb2CuCl3 single crystals with the size of 3 cm in length via the low-temperature method.68 This Rb2CuCl3 single crystal has a PL peak at 397 nm with a large Stokes shift of 111 nm and a near-unity PLQY of 99.4%, as shown in Fig. 11b.68 Due to the high PLQY as well as the negligible self-absorption, Rb2CuCl3 single crystals also show good performance in X-ray scintillators.68 Creason et al. demonstrated the synthesis of Rb2CuX3 (X = Cl, Br) polycrystalline powders via a solid-state method.28 Rb2CuBr3 and Rb2CuCl3 polycrystalline powders show PL peaks at 385 nm and 395 nm, with FWHMs of 54 nm and 52 nm, as shown in Fig. 11c, and PLQYs of 64% and 85%, respectively.28 Moreover, they also studied optical cooling by anti-Stokes photoluminescence (ASPL) properties of lead-free halides for the first time, as shown in Fig. 11d. Rb2CuCl3 showed an ASPL that could provide up to 32% optical cooling efficiency due to its high PLQY and relatively low trap-states density.28 Moreover, the synthesis of Rb2CuBr3 polycrystalline powders by the solvent-free grinding method was reported, which shows PL emission of 390 nm.53

In 2020, the synthesis of Rb2CuBr3 and Rb2CuCl3 colloidal nanocrystals were reported via the room temperature scalable LARP method.69 The spherical shapes of these nanocrystals have a size of 7.7 nm and 7.5 nm for Rb2CuBr3 and Rb2CuCl3, respectively. These Rb2CuBr3 and Rb2CuCl3 nanocrystals display PL emission peaks at 387 nm and 400 nm, with FWHMs of 50 nm and 52 nm, showing high PLQYs of 100% and 49%, respectively. These nanocrystals have a long PL lifetime that is consistent with their bulk counterparts, 46.7 μs for Rb2CuBr3 and 9.9 μs for Rb2CuCl3. Due to the high thermal stability and good compatibility in PDMS polymer, these nanocrystals show potential in optoelectronic applications.69 Though cesium copper halides and rubidium copper halides nanocrystals have been synthesized successfully, only green and blue emission can be achieved and analogous potassium copper halides nanocrystals have still not been reported.


2.3.2 Potassium copper halides (K2CuX3, X = Cl, Br) single crystals and polycrystalline powders. 
In 2020, Creason et al. successfully synthesized polycrystalline powders and single crystals of K2CuX3 (X = Cl, Br).29 Here, K2CuX3 (X = Cl, Br) polycrystalline powders were synthesized by a solid-state method. K2CuCl3 single crystal can be synthesized by a molten salt flux growth method and a temperature lowering method, as shown in Fig. 11e. Meanwhile, K2CuBr3 single crystals can be synthesized by the liquid–liquid diffusion, as shown in Fig. 11e, and the vapor-liquid diffusion methods. The as-synthesized K2CuX3 (X = Cl, Br) single crystals were needle-shaped sizes of ∼1 cm in length. Interestingly, the molten salt was firstly used as a reactive flux for the synthesis of K2CuX3 (X = Cl, Br), though the as-synthesized K2CuCl3 single crystals have dark-colored impurities and inclusions due to rapid oxidation of the surface CuCl.29 K2CuCl3 and K2CuBr3 polycrystalline powders have PL peaks at 392 nm and 388 nm, with FWHM of 54 nm, showing PLQYs of 96.58% and 55%, respectively,29 as shown in Fig. 11f. Compared to Rb2CuX3 (X = Cl, Br) single crystals, K2CuX3 (X = Cl, Br) single crystals exhibit both improved air stability and photostability while preserving their blue emission.28,29,37,68 K2CuCl3 is found to exhibit radioluminescence at a wavelength similar to the blue emission from PL when exposed to bremsstrahlung X-rays, indicating that K2CuX3 has potential in practical optical and radiation detection applications.29 Gao et al. also reported the successful synthesis of K2CuCl3 single crystals which exhibit violet emission at 386 nm with PLQY of 98.8% and product yield of 57% via a facile solution process method.70 K2CuBr3 single crystals were also reported via the same method, showing a PL peak at 391 nm with a high PLQY of 86.98%.71

2.4 Photophysics and optical properties
Most copper-based halides26,27,45,58,59 were reported to exhibit wide FWHM, large Stokes shifts as well as long lifetimes, which can be attributed to self-trapped excitons (STEs) emission.
As a classic phenomenon originating from soft lattice and strong electron–phonon coupling, STEs have been confirmed in halide crystals,72 condensed rare gases,73 different kinds of perovskites74 and so on. Upon photoexcitation, strong electron–phonon coupling leads to severe lattice deformation in hundreds of femtoseconds, followed by the spatial separation of the electrons and the holes. A self-trapped state with higher stability will be formed, which also has a narrower band gap and higher localized carriers than the original state. Finally, photons with a broad spectrum, large Stokes shift and long lifetime will be emitted, all of which are characteristics of STEs.
Lian et al.75 reported a deeper explanation of the photophysics in Cs3Cu2X5 (X = Cl, Br, and I). In the initial state, Cs3Cu2X5 consists of numerous [Cu2X5]3− species which are completely separated by Cs+ cations. Each [Cu2X5]3− species can be regarded as a [CuX4]3− tetrahedron and a [CuX3]2- trigonal planar unit sharing one edge. Under UV excitation, strong electron–phonon coupling distorts the lattice. The migration of Cu+ ions caused by the deformation finally leads to the formation of spindle-like [Cu2X5]3− species composed of two tetrahedrons sharing one common face (Fig. 12a). The electrons and the holes are separated spatially, with the holes accumulating around the spindle-like [Cu2X5]3− species and the electrons spanning the other sites in the unit cell. Both lattice deformation and carrier migration will lose some energies, so the emission photon energy that comes from STEs is much smaller than the band gap of the material (Fig. 12b). Highly localized carriers lead to insensitivity to defects within the material, which can be supported by the linear relationship between the PL intensity and the excitation power. The carrier recombination process is suppressed by the spatial separation, result in a long PL lifetime. Note that there is an abnormal blue-shift in PL spectra as the anion X− changes from Cl− to I−. Cs3Cu2Cl5 shows bright green emission while both Cs3Cu2Br5 and Cs3Cu2I5 have a blue emission (Fig. 8c). This phenomenon is attributed to the synergistic effect of the strong excitonic effect and the structure deformation.75

Reprinted with permission from 76, Copyright 2020, American Chemical Society. 
Du et al.76 also showed that the emission from CsCu2X3 (X = Cl, Br, and I) is due to STEs. They investigated the excited-state energy of CsCu2X3 (X = Cl, Br, and I) by first-principles calculations. They revealed three types of STEs with distinct structures (Fig. 12c) and their halogen-dependent relative stabilities regardless of the same crystal structure. Different from Cs3Cu2X5 (X = Cl, Br, and I)75 and Rb2CuX3 (X = Cl, Br),28 the PL emission from CsCu2Cl3 to CsCu2Br3 to CsCu2I3 is red-shifted. Although it appears to follow the usual trend, the red shift of the PL peak results from the three different types of STE rather than the band gap change. The emissions in CsCu2Br3 and CsCu2I3 are attributed to the lowest-energy STE, while the emission in CsCu2Cl3 is caused by a metastable STE. It is worth noting that STE emission can be significantly enhanced by pressure compression.77 The emission of CsCu2I3 single crystals changes from yellow to green when the pressure is increased to 4.1 GPa, then the PL peak shifts back when the pressure is further increased to 4.4 GPa. After that, the intensity of yellow emission is enhanced with the increasing pressure. However, the emission is weakened gradually when the pressure is increased from 8 GPa to 16 GPa.77 The slight enhancement of emission is attributed to the intertetrahedral distortion, and the obvious increase of the PL intensity is due to the significant structural distortions from both intra- and intertetrahedra.77 This study provides a new insight to understand STE emission.
It was reported that the PL lifetimes of Cs2CuBr4 and Cs2CuCl4 QDs (Fig. 9d) are much shorter than the above-mentioned copper halides and their PL decay curves can be fitted by a bi-exponential function.62 For Cs2CuBr4 QDs, t1 was 42.5 ns and t2 was 136.5 ns. For Cs2CuCl4 QDs, t1 was 39.8 ns and t2 was 160.4 ns.62 The fast decay of the luminescence is induced by exciton recombination while the slow decay of the luminescence might be originated from the recombination due to surface defects.62 The PL peaks of Cs2CuCl4, Cs2CuBr4 and Cs2Cu(Br/I)4 QDs were located at 385 nm, 410 nm, and 504 nm, respectively.62 The direct adjustment of the band structure leads to the tuning of PL induced by halide composition. The optical properties of these QDs could also be tuned by particle sizes and precursor ratios. When the CsBr:CuBr2 ratio increased from 1:4 to 1:2, the sizes of Cs2CuBr4 QDs decreased from 14.2 to 4.7 nm. As a result, the PL peak of Cs2CuBr4 QDs was tuned from 466 to 410 nm, suggesting that the quantum confinement effects may be responsible for the band gap tuning.62 The synthesis methods and optical parameters of alkali copper-based halides are summarized in Table 1.

3 Other copper halides
3.1 Double layer copper halides
Given the formula A2B′B′′X6, where A site occupants are large monovalent cations (Cs, MA or FA), B′ and B′′ sites are for monovalent and trivalent metals respectively, and X sites are halogens, double perovskites offer an innovative solution for researchers to adjust perovskite material's band gap and other properties. Among all candidates in monovalent B′ sites, copper and silver have been noticed because of their suitable ionic size and electronegativity. The majority of the research to date has focused on silver double perovskites (such as Cs2AgSbCl6, Cs2AgInCl6, Cs2AgBiCl6, etc.),80–82 while copper(I) receives relatively less attention. That may be due to the nature of the copper(I) ions. First, copper(I) ions have smaller ionic sizes compared with silver(I) ions, and they are unable to coordinate with a high number of large halogens such as Br and I. The fact that the [CuI6]2− octahedra do not form compared to [CuBr6]2−, verifies this conclusion.83 Second, compared to silver, copper(I) is easier to be oxidized to copper(II), which would degrade the perovskite structure. Therefore, most of the copper double perovskite studies thus far are computational and not synthetic. Materials such as A2SbCuX6 ((A = Cs2, MA2, FA2, CsMA, CsFA, and MAFA; X = I, Br, and Cl; where, MA = CH3NH3 and FA = CH(NH2)2)),84 A2BiCuX6,85 and A2InCuX6 have been theoretically studied.83 The solid-state synthesis for Cs2CuInCl6 and Cs2CuInBr6 have been reported and showed that only CsCu2X3 and Cs3In2X9 were formed, while no Cu(I)-based double perovskites were detected in the product. However, in a recent report, Pham et al. performed the DFT calculation showing that Cs2CuInCl6 has a direct band gap between 1.05 eV and 1.73 eV depending on the varying functionals used.86 They suggest that Cs2CuInCl6 may be stable on certain appropriate substrates, but to the best of our knowledge, the successful synthesis of Cs2CuInCl6 has not been reported yet.
Compared with the promise of theoretical calculations, reports of the copper double perovskites are rare. Zhou et al.87 firstly reported the synthesis of Cs2CuSbCl6 double perovskite nanocrystals (Fig. 13a) by modified one-pot hot injection in 2020. The NCs possessed an indirect band gap of 1.66 eV (Fig. 13b), which is the smallest recorded band gap for lead-free double perovskite NCs.87 In addition, the XRD pattern of the NCs remained unchanged for over 40 days in ambient air, confirming the NCs’ stability against the oxygen and moisture.87 Jafar et al. fabricated solar cell devices by incorporating Cs2CuSbCl6 as a sensitizer, demonstrating the promising application of Cs2CuSbCl6 in the area of photovoltaics.88

In 2017, Vargas et al. reported the synthesis of Cs4CuSb2Cl12.89 They successfully synthesized the material from aqueous solution, at gram scale, and their characterization showed the material is a mixed metal 〈111〉-oriented layered perovskite (Fig. 13c).89 3D Cs4CuSb2Cl12 has a 1.0 eV direct band gap (Fig. 13d) and the conductivity is 10 times greater than MAPbI3, representing a theoretical maximum efficiency of 30.8% for single absorber solar cells. Considering the superior tolerance against heat and moisture, the authors conclude that the material is a promising material for photovoltaic applications.89 Following this discovery, efforts have been made to improve the synthesis technique as well as narrowing the size of the perovskite particles. Singhal et al. reported a solid-state synthesis route for Cs4CuSb2Cl12 by grinding CsCl, SbCl3 and CuCl2 hydrate under an ambient environment.90 This reaction route has a nearly 100% atom economy and is easy to scale up, and may be competitive in industrial applications.90 Wang et al. reported a top-down synthesis of Cs4CuSb2Cl12 NCs.91 The exfoliated NCs were characterized to have a 1.6 eV band gap, and the thin film of the nanocrystal showed a rapid and steady photoelectrochemical response, demonstrating that NCs are a promising material in the optoelectronic application.91 Cai et al. reported the first colloidal synthesis of Cs4CuSb2Cl12 nanocrystals in 2020.92 The synthesized NCs have a direct band gap of 1.79 eV which is larger than the bulk sample (1.0 eV). The band gap increase is attributed to the quantum confinement. They also reported the synthesis of Cs4CuxAg2−2xSb2Cl12 nanocrystals and demonstrated that the increase in copper ratio in the material leads to a crystal structural transformation from cubic double perovskite (x = 0) to monoclinic layered double perovskite (x = 1). Jayasankar et al. fabricated the first self-powered Cs4CuSb2Cl12 photodetector, which demonstrates the material's potential application in photovoltaic devices.93
3.2 Organic–inorganic copper halides
Copper-based organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites (OIHPs) are promising alternatives to organic–inorganic hybrid lead perovskites for photovoltaic and optoelectronic applications because of the non-toxicity, eco-friendliness, and stability of oxidation states. Recently, several papers on Cu(II)-based organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites have been reported which show their potential application in optoelectronics. In 2016, for the first time, Cortecchia et al. synthesized 2D copper OIHPs, MA2CuClxBr4−x (MA = methylamine, x = 0.5, 1, 2, and 4) by temperature lowering method from ethanol solution.34 These MA2CuClxBr4−x perovskite powders belong to the orthorhombic space group of Acam, except for MA2CuCl4, which is monoclinic with space group of P121/a1, as shown in Fig. 13e.34 The band gap of this series of perovskites is 1.80 eV–2.48 eV depending on the Cl/Br ratio, suggesting its potential to be a light harvester in solar cells.34,94 Recently, the MA2CuX4 (X = Cl, I, Br, Cl/Br, and Cl/I) perovskite solar cells have been fabricated by Elseman et al. with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) from 0.99% to 2.41% with different ratios of halogens.95
In 2018, the synthesis of (PMA)2CuBr4 (PMA = benzylamine) perovskite crystals was reported via a low-temperature crystallization method using HBr and the fabrication of (PMA)2CuBr4 thin films by spin-coating.96 The 2D perovskite (PMA)2CuBr4 crystal has a hexagonal crystal structure, consisting of inorganic layers of planar CuBr42− anions separated by double organic layers of PMA+ cations. (PMA)2CuBr4 crystal exhibits a low band gap of 1.81 eV and a high absorption coefficient of 1 × 105 cm−1 at the most intensive absorbance peak at 539 nm. This (PMA)2CuBr4 was also applied to solar cell applications, with a PCE of 0.2%.96 Recently, the PCE of Cu-based (PMA)2CuX3 (X = Cl/I, Br/I) perovskites solar cell can be enhanced to 0.63% by using mesoporous zinc oxide as an electron transport layer.97
Besides Cu(II)-based organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites, Peng et al. reported Cu(I)-based organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite (MA)4Cu2Br6 single crystals synthesized by the slow evaporation method.98 This (MA)4Cu2Br6 single crystal belongs to the triclinic space group of P, consisting of Cu2Br64− corner-sharing tetrahedral dimers bonding with CH3NH3+ cations by hydrogen bonds between the ammonium end group and halogen anions, as shown in Fig. 13f. The (MA)4Cu2Br6 single crystal exhibits a bright green emission of 524 nm, which is assigned to the STE, with the FWHM of 107 nm and a high PLQY of 93%.98 Overall, this class of materials has shown more promise for use in photovoltaics, than the all-inorganic ternary copper halides. Despite their strong PL properties, these materials have not yet been touted for their potential in emissive optoelectronic applications, such as lighting or displays.
4 Applications
4.1 Light-emitting diodes (LEDs)
Copper-based lead-free halides have shown tremendous potential as light emitters in light-emitting diodes (LEDs) due to their excellent optoelectronic properties, high stability and nontoxicity. The first Cu(I)-based ternary copper halide LED was demonstrated in 2018 where Jun et al. used Cu3Cu2I5 showing an ultrahigh PLQY and good stability in ambient conditions.35 They demonstrated the fabrication of a blue LED with the luminance of ∼10 cd m−2.35 The unfavourable energy alignment of the bands was blamed for its poor performance. Further research and several optimization methods have led to better-performing LEDs. Wang et al. used Cs3Cu2I5 NCs with a high PLQY of 87% to fabricate deep-blue LEDs.61 The device schematic for the LED is shown in Fig. 14a. A maximum luminance value of 262.6 cd m−2 was found at 7.5 V, with an EQE of 1.12%, as shown in Fig. 14b.61 This is comparable to the best performing lead-based perovskite LEDs, and this deep blue LED shows exceptional operation stability with a record half lifetime of ∼108 h.61 Another report demonstrated the performance of deep blue Cu-based LEDs where films were fabricated by the dual-thermal vacuum evaporation method.48 These showed higher crystallinity and easier integration into industrial production methods, as compared to solution-processed Cs3Cu2I5 films.48 Their best LED device with the structure of glass/ITO/MoO3 (6 nm)/Cs3Cu2I5 (85 nm)/LiF (1 nm)/HAT-CN (40 nm)/NPB (20 nm)/Al (100 nm), as shown in Fig. 14c, shows a relatively low turn-on voltage of 3.6 V with a maximum luminance value obtained at ∼70 cd m−2 and an EQE of 0.1%.48 These deep blue devices show high ambient stability and reasonable luminance but the efficiency overall is poor due to difficulty injecting charges into the deep hole and high electron conduction bands.

Yellow lead-based perovskite LEDs, emitting via electroluminescence (EL), tend to suffer from color instability due to halide separation under higher voltage bias. Ma et al. fabricated stable yellow LEDs using CsCu2I3 as the light emitter.41 This LED has a device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/poly-TPD/CsCu2I3/TPBi/LiF/Al, as shown in Fig. 14d. The device produces a T50 lifetime of 5.2 h, a maximum luminance value of 47.5 cd m−2 at an applied bias of 9.2 V, and a high turn-on voltage of ∼5 V.41 In 2019, Roccanova et al. applied CsCu2I3 yellow emitter into 1,3-bis(N-carbazolyl)benzene (mCP) host as the emissive layer of a LED device, with a device structure of ITO/MoO3/TAPC/mCP:CsCu2I3/TmPyPb/LiF/Al, achieving an LED with yellow electroluminescence.27
In addition to blue emissive Cs3Cu2I5 LEDs and yellow emissive CsCu2I3 LEDs, Cu-based white LEDs (WLEDs) were also studied. Notably, Ma et al. reported Cu-based WLEDs using Cs3Cu2I5 @ CsCu2I3 composite film as an emissive layer with good performance.51 Owing to the same composition and phase transformation properties of Cs3Cu2I5 and CsCu2I3, Cs3Cu2I5 doped CsCu2I3 composite films with cold and warm white light emission can be achieved by varying the CuI to CsI molar ratios, showing good thermal stability and photostability.51 This composite film was also applied to electrically driven WLEDs with a device architecture of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/poly-TPD/Cs3Cu2I5 @ CsCu2I3/TPBi/LiF/Al, as shown in Fig. 14e.51 This WLED demonstrated a maximum luminance of 145 cd m−2, showing two EL peaks at 445 nm and 550 nm, with a turn-on voltage of 4.7 V, an EQE of 0.15% and a high color rendering index (CRI) of 91.6.51
Due to the high PLQYs of these cesium copper halides, they were also applied to UV-pumped LEDs to achieve monochrome or white light emission via a down-conversion mechanism. 0D Cs3Cu2I5 showing highly blue emission PL with QY up to 89% has been used as a solid-state phosphor to demonstrate a UV-pumped LED.38 3D CsCu2Cl3 and 0D Cs3Cu2Cl5 NCs exhibiting blue and bright green emission, respectively, were used along with red phosphor CaAlSiN3:Eu2+ to fabricate the WLEDs by Zhao et al.99 These WLEDs show exceptional operational stability with a high CRI, adequate CCT and 64% retention in luminous efficiency even after 60 h.99 Another WLED with ultra-high CRI has been fabricated using β-Cs3Cu2Cl5 for its intense cyan-green emitting, BaMgAl10O17:Eu2+ blue phosphor and (Sr,Ca)AlSiN3:Eu2+ red phosphor.100 Recently, ultra-stable 1D CsCu2I3 single crystal with strong yellow emission and an outstanding PLQY of 50.4% have been synthesized.101 WLEDs produced using this single crystal as the yellow phosphor and BaMgAl10O17:Eu2+ blue phosphor show working lifetimes of ∼580 h and a T50 lifetime of 150 h.101 Green emissive Cs3Cu2Cl5 and blue emissive Cs3Cu2I5 have been used as the only phosphors in a UV-pumped phosphor converting (pc) LED making it the first pc-LED based on all copper halides and paving the way for further research.102 A UV-pumped white-emitting LED was fabricated by using the mixture of Cs3Cu2I5 and CsCu2I3 with the ratio of 3:8 as shown in Fig. 14f, which shows tunable CIE coordinates in the white light region by varying the ratio of Cs3Cu2I5 and CsCu2I3.52
4.2 Photodetectors
Ternary copper halides have also been used in UV photodetectors. Research has progressed for these materials because of the wide range of applications like fluorescence detectors, flame detectors, image sensors, inter-space transmission, missile warning and biomedical sensors that can make use of UV photodetection.103 For commercialization of these photodetectors, the effort has been expended to improve the photoresponsivity (A W−1), specific detectivity (Jones), response speed, environmental stability, and non-toxicity of materials.
Zhang et al.46 demonstrated a deep ultraviolet (DUV) photodetector made up of Cs3Cu2I5 (Fig. 15a) in 2019 for the first time. They fabricated the devices by using Cs3Cu2I5 crystalline films obtained by a solution-based growth strategy and Cs3Cu2I5 films prepared directly by spin-coating method. They found that the photoresponse of the device using Cs3Cu2I5 crystalline films is better, which may be related to the material quality.46 The resulting photosensor shows a reasonable sensitivity to 265 nm and 365 nm irradiation with the responsivity of 64.9 mA W−1 (Fig. 15b), a specific detectivity of 6.9 × 1011 Jones, and response speeds of 26.2/49.9 ms for rise/fall times, and its photoresponsivity did not change even after kept in the air for one month.46 In addition, the as-fabricated photodetector can be utilized for image sensors.46 Later, the performance of the UV photodetector based on Cs3Cu2I5 films was improved. A narrow response window of 300–370 nm was achieved by the incorporation of Cs3Cu2I5/GaN heterojunction (Fig. 15c).47 In addition to the results of the basic photodetector parameters like responsivity (0.28 A W−1), specific detection rate (1.4 × 1012), specific detectivity (1.2 × 105 Jones), maximum current on/off ratio (95/130 μs), the photodetector possesses a good temperature tolerance and environmental stability.47 Another DUV sensitive photodetector fabricated by using spin-coated Cs3Cu2I5 exhibits improved photoresponsivity of 17.8 A W−1 and a detectivity of 1.12 × 1012 Jones, which compared favorably to previous reports.47 The photoresponsivity remained even after storage for 80 days in air.47 Liang et al.104 presented a photodetector with an improved broadband range from the deep UV to near-infrared region based on Cs3Cu2I5/Si-core/shell NW as shown in Fig. 15d. The obtained photodetector possesses a very fast response speed of 92.5/189.2 μs (rise/fall) and a high photoresponsivity of 130 mA W−1.

Similar to the reported DUV photodetector based on the Cs3Cu2I5 film,46 the DUV photodetector50 based on the CsCu2I3 films is also blind in the visible region but is sensitive to 265 and 365 nm light. It exhibits high Ilight/Idark ratio of 22 along with a significant responsivity and specific detectivity of around 22.1 mA W−1 and 1.2 × 1011 Jones, respectively.50 Different morphologies of CsCu2I3 were also used for the fabrication of photodetectors. A unique polarization sensitive and highly flexible UV detector was reported by deploying the external morphological and asymmetric structural anisotropy of 1D CsCu2I3 NWs, as shown in Fig. 15e.64 After synthesizing the highly crystalline 1D CsCu2I3 NWs via an antisolvent engineering method, a single nanowire is transferred to the SiO2 substrate and Au is used as another electrode to make a metal insulator metal (MIM) device. Along with remarkable photoresponsivity and detectivity the devices exhibit significant flexibility and bending endurance by sustaining their photosensitivity after 1000 bending cycles.64 The same group also successfully demonstrated broadband and fast-response photodetector by using CsCu2I3 single crystal with facet-dependent photoresponse.105 They found that the photoelectric performance of the {010} crystal plane is better than that of the {110} crystal plane (Fig. 15f). The device based on the {010} crystal plane of an individual CsCu2I3 single crystal demonstrates a photoresponse from 300–700 nm, along with a detectivity of 1.8 × 1010 to 9.3 × 1010 Jones and a responsivity of 10–52 mA W−1.105 Recently, Mo et al.101 also utilized CsCu2I3 single crystals to fabricate a UV detector with a response at 340 nm and a response time of 50.4 ms.
4.3 Other applications
The exceptional properties of Cu-based halides have lent them to various other applications such as fluorescent inks, batteries, memristors, neuromorphic computing, X-ray scintillators. This can also be used in inkjet printing as a newer deposition method for display or lighting applications.
Blue emissive 0D Cs3Cu2I5, noted for its use in the demonstration of white LEDs, was further used for drawing patterns using the solution as a fluorescent ink using laser writing technology which shows potential for encryption applications (Fig. 16a).38

Three-dimensional Cs2CuBr4 is the first and only ternary copper halide to be employed as an anode in lithium-ion batteries.106 The galvanostatic charge discharge experiment performed up to 1400 cycles showing that the assembled battery shows exceptional capacity and cycling stability with a high capacity value of 420 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1, as shown in Fig. 16b.106 Moreover, the intercalation and deintercalation of lithium ions during the charge–discharge occurs at voltages below 10 mV.106 This level of performance is similar to graphite, one of the most commonly used anodes in commercial Li-ion batteries, indicating that this may be the potential commercial application of these materials.106
Apart from the above-mentioned applications, resistive switching and the biological synaptic properties using these materials have also been discovered, so they have the potential to be utilized for devices such as memristors. Recently, Zeng et al. have used Cs3Cu2I5 as an active layer in Ag/PMMA/Cs3Cu2I5/ITO memristor device, showing cycle tests of current–voltage properties with 50 sweeps without collapse, as shown in Fig. 16c.107 The endurance of 100 successive cycles with an on/off ratio of 102 and the turn-on voltage ≤±1 V is observed for this device. Additionally, the biological synaptic properties like long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) were also checked. As a result of the MNIST handwritten data set and simulation performance, the handwritten recognition rate of 94% is achieved.107
Additionally, these materials are finding use in X-ray scintillators. Recently, Cu halide compounds like Rb2CuX3 (X = Cl, Br) and K2CuBr3 single crystals with high PLQYs and Cs3Cu2I5 nanocrystal were reported for X-ray scintillation applications. In 2019, Yang et al. applied Rb2CuBr3 as a sensitive X-ray scintillator with a high radioluminescence light yield of 91056 photons per MeV.37 This Rb2CuBr3 has a liner response covering a large range of dose rate from 24.3 nGyair s−1 to 15.7 μGyair s−1, showing a detection limit of 121.5 nGyair s−1, as shown in Fig. 16d.37 The low detection limit of Rb2CuBr3 is much lower than that of the traditional scintillator, doped (Lu/Y)2SiO5 (LYSO), showing its good foundations for low-dose radiography.37 Besides, Rb2CuCl3 was also reported as a promising X-ray scintillator by Zhao et al. due to its appreciable light yield of 16600 photons per MeV, a wide range of scintillation response from 48.6 nGyair s−1 to 15.7 μGyair s−1, and a low detection limit of 88.5 nGyair s−1, which showed slightly better detection limit than that of the Rb2CuX3.68 Gao et al. reported K2CuBr3 as X-ray scintillator with ultralow inherent radioactivity as compared to Rb2CuX3 (X = Cl, Br), which showed a measured light yield of 23806 photons per MeV and a detection limit of 132.8 nGyair s−1.71 Lian et al. reported Cs3Cu2I5 nanocrystal X-ray scintillators showing X-ray stopping power comparable to the conventional scintillator CsI:Tl and a higher light yield of 79279 photons per MeV.60 X-ray imaging was also demonstrated through prototype experiments using solution-processed Cs3Cu2I5 nanocrystal films.60 Tl-Doped Cs3Cu2I5 single crystals were also used in scintillators by Yuan et al., exhibiting a light yield of 51000 photons per MeV and a higher energy resolution of 4.5% at 662 keV, than that of the commercial scintillator NaI:Tl.42 This suggests potential in security and industrial γ-ray spectroscopy applications.42
Additionally, Li et al. demonstrated that the purified Cs3Cu2Cl5 NCs solution can be utilized for inkjet printing.26 The arrays of dots were printed on a functionalized silicon substrate, and the printed patterns emit bright green color excited by 254 nm UV light as shown in Fig. 16e, implying the potential of cesium copper halides for patterned displays and lighting applications.26
5 Perspective and conclusion
5.1 Future outlook for ternary copper halides
Clearly, ternary copper halides, whether presented as perovskites, analogues, derivatives or similarly inspired materials, have become an attractive family of materials for many applications and there are many groups actively working in this sub-field. These materials have several properties in common, that are unique among emissive compounds, including wide band gaps, a high PLQY at visible wavelengths, large FWHM, long PL lifetimes, high charge mobilities, and high absorption cross-sections with UV excitation. Some downsides to using these materials include the deep-UV excitation required for emission due to the wide band gap, the very long lifetime which can hinder recombination efficiency in devices, and the deep hole levels, which hinder both charge injection and charge harvesting. As such several continuing trends are expected to be areas of active interest among these materials, as the benefits and drawbacks to ternary copper halides are further catalogued and assessed.
Emission from the crystals and nanocrystals above are the most salient feature of the ternary copper halides. The presence of well-defined emission peaks at visible wavelengths in the green and blue suggest the possibility of using them in a wide array of PL applications. However, there are some challenges here. The wide FWHM is a problem for some applications, such as displays and some lighting applications, where saturated (pure) colors are needed. For other applications, though, this is a benefit, especially in room lighting where colors near the center of the CIE diagram are preferred and already some high CRI metrics (>90%) have been observed. The high PLQY and non-toxicity of copper are particularly useful for this application, but the long-term stability of the material will need to be proven, and in some cases improved.
Stability, and the related metrics of device lifetime, are certainly an area of concern for ternary copper halides, as it was (and still is) a concern for the lead perovskites that inspired this sub-field. Many materials presented here are air-sensitive to varying degrees, lasting anywhere from a few minutes to a few months in air, before losing their PLQY or decaying into other products. Some of these effects can be mitigated by improving the ligand coatings or device packaging, or simply by working under nitrogen or in vacuum. Materials containing Cu(I) are particularly vulnerable to oxidation, which can introduce trap states or cause conversion to other structures. Other materials, such as Cs3Cu2I5 tend to morph into other crystal structures, or produce crystalline impurities such as CsI, changing their emission spectra. To date, the effect of air on ternary copper halides has not been well described, since oxygen and water can both affect the structure via oxidation processes, dissolution of the crystal, intercalation into the crystal structure or extraction of the halides (e.g. iodide).
Instability and reactivity to environmental effects are often considered a negative property for optoelectronics since these effects are not ideal for normal LED or photovoltaic devices. However, they can be useful for improved sensing applications, where PLQY, peak position, PL lifetime or ratiometric peak intensity, in the case of two crystalline phases, could all be used as the measurable signal. This has been demonstrated for temperature or pressure sensors and other chemical sensing applications could also make use of the PL sensitivity. Redox-based sensors making use of the conversion of Cu(I) to Cu(II) are already common among molecular copper compounds and the changes in PL in ternary copper halides could also make use of this effect.
Finally, the color palette of the current crop of copper materials is lacking in the red end of the visible spectrum. Just as lead-based perovskites face a “red wall” at 790 nm, ternary copper halides have an “orange wall” at roughly 580 nm, with CsCu2I3 uniquely accounting for emission beyond the blue and green parts of the visible spectrum. For true white lighting and display applications, redder emitting materials will need to be found. The reason for this lack of lower energy emitters is not well understood. The band gaps of ternary copper halides are very wide, usually in the UV or deep blue and the STE mechanism, which red-shifts the PL peaks relative to the absorbance spectrum, occurs due to deformation of the local crystal structure when excited. The width of the apparent Stokes shift is due to the degree of deformation, which is limited by the geometry of the crystal structure and bonding strength of the atoms. For redder materials to be found, either ternary halides must be discovered with a smaller ground state band gap, or they must be able to endure a larger degree of deformation to induce deeper self-trapped states.
The solution to this is to discover more materials and gain increased synthetic control of the materials that are known. Another option, of course, is to investigate other metal ions in ternary halides, such as Mn, In or Fe, may have more favorable emission, and new materials are being reported all the time. Furthermore, there is a great deal of room for improvement in shape control of ternary copper halides, including finding a greater degrees of confinement in 0D particles, control of 1D and 2D nanocrystals with a confined dimension, and other shapes such as sheets, tetrapods, cubes, etc. that have been already developed for traditional lead perovskites and quantum dots. Further control of the dimensions of the copper clusters within the crystal itself also promises to yield at least variation in the emission properties of the crystal and nanocrystals, and could be the key to achieving red, or even near-infrared (NIR), emitters.
5.2 Conclusion
Overall, these ternary metal halides constitute an important new class of materials with incredible emission properties. Materials in the family AmCunXi where A is a monovalent cation and X is a halide seem to possess ideal STE emission for a variety of applications. These will certainly find use in niche applications relating to LEDs, photovoltaics, emissive dyes, X-ray scintillators, UV photodetectors and sensing applications that were previously occupied by quantum dots and perovskites. But they also have their own set of unique problems. Some of these will be solved by improving our basic understanding of the fundamental physics of self-trapping materials, particularly in low dimensional particles, or particles with strained or relaxed crystal structures. Other issues require superior chemistry or improved material engineering. While no single application is guaranteed to be successful, what is certain is that this class of materials will continue to grow in the next few years with the same brisk pace as the research described above.
