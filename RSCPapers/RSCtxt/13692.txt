    , Accepted 12th September 2012First published on 12th September 2012AbstractWe report the effect of neodymium (Nd) doping of TiO2 thin films produced on quartz, soda lime and silicon substrates by RF co-sputtering of two targets of TiO2 and metallic Nd. The Nd/Ti ratio was varied in the range of 0.9–100 at.%. A study based on a joint use of Auger electron spectroscopy and X-ray fluorescence analysis allowed us to define the chemical composition of all the deposited films. A piece of direct evidence of the structural changes (phase transformation from anatase to rutile for Nd/Ti atomic ratio up to 43 at.%) and amorphization for an Nd/Ti ratio equal to 100 at.%, a lattice distortion due to Nd incorporation and also the rare-earth ion location site was obtained by X-ray diffraction studies, in correlation with the optical properties analysis. NIR photoluminescence properties of the doped films in the wavelength range of 800–1200 nm were investigated by direct (green, blue-green and blue lines at 514.5, 496 and 476 nm respectively) and indirect excitations of Nd (using the UV line at 355 nm), in the latter case excitation through the titania host. In both cases, an intense NIR photoluminescence was observed at 907 and 1093 nm pertaining to the transitions between the excited 4F3/2 to 4I9/2 and 4I11/2 levels of the Nd3+ ions for the lowest ion concentration (Nd/Ti ratio equal to 0.9 at.%) and a correlation between the phase structure of the matrix and Nd concentration and the emission properties was found.
1. Introduction
Crystalline and wide gap oxides doped with trivalent lanthanide ions have increasingly gained importance in the last few years for their useful applications in optoelectronics and lighting devices, in photo-catalysis, optical imaging and also in photon frequency down- and up-conversion. For the latter, the optical frequency conversion through photoluminescence was suggested in the 70's in solar cells coupled with luminescent concentrators.1 Although organic dyes show high quantum efficiencies (0.5–1.0) of the absorption and reemission process in the visible range (400–700 nm) for low dye concentrations, in the NIR (>700 nm), the fluorescence quantum yield is too low (0.05–0.25).2 Due to this low quantum yield of the employed organic molecules in the NIR and their poor photo-stability, other materials were searched such as quantum dots and doped nanostructured semi-conductors for silicon solar cells. In the literature, many studies reported on doping of titania by numerous lanthanide ions, investigating the effect on the luminescence and structural properties.3–9 In this regard, the process of photon absorption in TiO2 followed by an energy transfer toward some levels of a rare earth ion is particularly effective.10 Titania was synthesized either as nanoparticles or thin films. Sol–gel dip-coating was the most used method to prepare titania and dope it with lanthanide ions like Sm3+, Eu3+, Yb3+, Er3+, Pr3+ and Nd3+. Near-infrared photoluminescence is useful for applications in optoelectronics and photovoltaics and for such purposes Nd is very promising. Doping with this ion and the related luminescence and structural effects have been investigated in many semi-conductor matrices such as GaN,11,12 AlN,13 Si–ZrO214and (Y, Gd)BO3 phosphors.15 Near-infrared luminescence induced by Nd3+ in lower gap semi-conductors incorporation in silicon-rich silicon oxide (SRSO) and amorphous hydrogenated silicon sub-nitrides was also explored.16,17
In this paper, we report on the results of an investigation on Nd incorporation into a nanocrystalline TiO2 thin film matrix at different concentrations. Only doping with low concentrations is generally pursued in order to avoid dopant clustering and luminescence quenching. The notable point is that very few investigations have focused on the incorporation of neodymium into titania. In the present work the doped TiO2 films were grown by RF sputter deposition and a lack of knowledge subsists in the literature concerning sputter deposited neodymium-doped titania and in particular the neodymium concentration limit in the host matrix beyond which no photon down-shifting effect occurs. To our knowledge, there has been no analysis in this matrix concerning the experimental investigation on the influence of doping limit, where such a wide series of concentrations has been studied. The use of a multi-technique analytical approach helped us to characterize the films with respect to their chemical composition, especially at the low Nd concentrations. The films were also characterized for their structural and optical properties and their near-infrared photoluminescence under both resonant and non-resonant excitations. The joint study of the optical and structural properties allowed us to clarify the location site nature of the neodymium in the titania films. In the latter case, an efficient energy transfer between the matrix and the rare-earth ion was evidenced.
2. Experimental details
2.1. Sample preparation
Undoped- and neodymium-doped titanium dioxide thin films were deposited by radio frequency (13.56 MHz) co-sputtering. A commercially available high purity TiO2 disc (99.999%) with 10 cm diameter (Goodfellow) and metallic neodymium (99.99%) were used as cathodes and sputtered in a pure argon atmosphere, by keeping the argon flow rate constant at 30 sccm. The reactor base pressure was kept at 2 × 10−6 Pa. Separate power supplies (Advanced Energy RFX 600A and Advanced Energy CESAR) were connected to each target providing independent target power control. A constant power of 82 watts was applied to the TiO2 cathode in all the deposition processes, corresponding to a self-bias voltage of −850 V. In order to obtain different neodymium compositions in the films, a power in the range of 3–7 watts (voltage bias of −36, −47 and −70 V) was applied to the Nd target. Table 1 summarizes the deposition conditions and the sample numbering which, from S1 to S5, follows the power applied onto the Nd target, except for sample S2. The latter was prepared by exploiting the cross-contamination process which occurs when two facing targets are co-sputtered. Cross-contamination between targets is usually a factor to be avoided to preserve the purity of any following deposition processes. However in this case it was exploited to obtain samples with a neodymium concentration lower than the minimum achievable value with the standard co-sputtering process. In particular, the following procedure was pursued: (1) both the target surfaces were sputter cleaned in argon for 30 min, (2) the titania target was faced towards the Nd target and covered by neodymium, sputtered with a power of 7 watts for 9 h, and finally (3) the Nd-contaminated titania cathode was run in the sputtering regime. The samples were mounted on a rotating substrate holder support, water-cooled at room temperature, at a distance of 4 cm from the TiO2 cathode. All the depositions were carried out at 4 Pa working pressure. Films were deposited onto Silicon (100), 1 mm thick quartz and soda lime glass substrates. Beforehand these were ultrasonically cleaned with isopropyl alcohol, de-ionized water for 15 minutes each, finally flushed with nitrogen (N2) gas and then introduced into the growth chamber. All the films were deposited for 9 hours at room temperature. Ex situ post-deposition annealing treatments were made for six hours in ambient air, at a temperature of 600 °C, reached with a heating rate of 5 °C min−1. The film thickness was determined with a KLA – Tencor P-6 Stylus profilometer. The plasma parameters and the measured film thicknesses are given in Table 1.

2.2. The sample characterization

2.2.1 Auger electron spectroscopy (AES). 
Depth profile analyses – elemental concentration as a function of erosion depth – were carried out by Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) using a Physical Electronics model 4200 system, equipped with a variable resolution cylindrical mirror analyzer (CMA 03) and a coaxial electron gun. The system base pressure was kept at 10−8 Pa at room temperature. Auger spectra were excited by a 3 keV low energy electron beam, around 8 × 10−4 A cm−2 current density, that scanned an area of 400 μm2. The depth distribution of elements was recorded as a function of erosion depth, assessed on the basis of the erosion time and the film thickness. A differentially pumped ion gun, model 04-300, was used for the erosion process focused on a spot on the samples. The argon pressure during the measurements was kept at 10 mPa and the ion beam was rastered over an area of 1 mm2. Nd (MNN; 91 eV), Ti (LMM; 387 eV), C (KLL; 271 eV), O (KLL; 503 eV) and Si (LMM; 89 eV) lines were acquired.18


2.2.2 X-Ray fluorescence (XRF). 
X-Ray fluorescence analysis was performed using a theta–theta X-ray diffractometer (TNX Phoenix) with MoKα monochromatic radiation obtained with a parallel beam graded multilayer optics (AXO Dresden). The system was operated at 40 kV and 30 mA. The incidence angle was 45°. An SDD detector (KETEK 100 mm2) was placed at 90° with respect to the sample surface and at 22 mm distance in order to record the fluorescence intensity of the elements. The acquisition time depended on the concentration of Nd and was 200, 200, 2000, 40000 seconds for samples S2, S3, S4 and S5 respectively. The dead time of the acquisition system was between 5 and 7% for all samples.


2.2.3 X-ray diffraction (XRD). 
The crystallinity and the phase structure of pure and Nd doped titania thin films were investigated using a Seeman–Bohlin (grazing angle configuration) X-ray diffractometer and measurements were carried out by employing CuKα (λ = 1.5406 Å) radiation at an incident angle of 3°, in steps of 0.02° operated at 40 kV and 30 mA.
Crystallite size 〈D〉 and lattice strain (η) in the films were calculated using19 (1)where λ is the X-ray wavelength equal to 0.15405 nm for CuKα radiation, Bsize+strain is the full width at half-maximum (FWHM) of the peak considered (in rad), θ is the Bragg angle and 〈D〉 is the average crystallite size. K is approximately equal to 0.9.19 Here Bsize+strain is supposed to be induced by both low crystallite size and strain.
The crystallite diameter and the film internal strain were determined by means of the Williamson–Hall plot of Bcos θ as a function of sin θ.
Lattice constants a and c of the films are calculated using the formula:19 (2)where d is the interplanar distance and h, k, l are the Miller indices.


2.2.4 UV-visible and near IR spectrophotometry. 
A double beam spectrophotometer (Model – JASCO V-670), single monochromator design covering a wavelength range of 190 to 2700 nm was employed to record the optical transmittance and reflectance spectra of the deposited films at normal light incidence. An Al mirror was used as the 100% reflectance reference material.
The optical band gap of the transmitting thin films were calculated by Tauc's equation αhν = B(hν − Eg)m(3)where hν is the incident photon energy, B is a constant, Eg is the bandgap energy, the exponent m is characteristic of the type of optical transition process (m = 2 for indirect allowed transition and m = 0.5 for a direct allowed one) and α, the absorption coefficient can be determined near the absorption edge using the relationship (4)where t is the film thickness, T and R are the corresponding transmittance and reflectance, respectively. The allowed indirect bandgap energies can be obtained from the extrapolation of the linear region of (αhν)1/2 as a function of photon energy (hν) to the horizontal X-axis.


2.2.5 Photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL). 
Photoluminescence spectroscopy measurements were performed using the 514.5, 496 and 476 nm lines of a coherent Innova Sabre (Ar+) argon ion laser and the third harmonic of pulsed Nd-YAG laser for UV excitation (355 nm). The luminescence spectrum in the region of transition was detected by using a photomultiplier and a silicon detector. All measurements were carried out at room temperature.

3. Results and discussions
3.1. Film composition from AES
The concentration depth profile as a function of erosion depth for all detected elements determined by AES for the samples grown on silicon substrates (not shown here) was determined. Apart from the surface carbon contaminant, the average relative atomic concentration of each element Nd, Ti and O for all the samples is given in Table 1. The concentration of Nd in the TiO2 matrix increases with the power applied to the Nd target, while the oxygen remains almost unchanged in comparison. As we can observe, the atomic ratio of Nd/(Nd + Ti) strongly increases and O/(Nd + Ti) shows a slight reduction when the Nd to Ti atomic ratio varies from 5.5% to 100% (samples S3 to S5). The AES technique was not able to detect the Nd concentration in sample S2, for which another method was used, as discussed in the following section. Here we suppose that oxygen is not only bound to titanium but to neodymium also.20,21 Only the variation of the relative concentration of oxygen within a series has to be considered, instead of its absolute value which is significantly under-estimated. The AES analysis of a multi-component material, when combined with energetic ion erosion (depth profile), is often affected by non-negligible effects related to both electron irradiation and ion bombardment. In 3d transition metal oxides (TiO2) the electron beam often induces stimulated oxygen desorption. The desorption process originates from the production of a core hole on the cation, followed by an inter-atomic Auger process and desorption of oxygen via the Coulomb explosion.22 The loss of oxygen produces reduction phenomena of the surface oxide leading to a not negligible alteration of the surface chemical composition and under-estimation of the film stoichiometry. This electron beam induced oxide reduction results in changes in the line shape and peak position of the main Auger transitions of titanium, which impede in obtaining the description of the actual surface composition of the films. Energetic ion bombardment, beside the removal of the atoms, is also responsible for changes in the surface composition and morphology, creating an alterated layer whose composition can be different from the volume beneath (oxygen preferential sputtering, leading to titanium surface enrichment). Despite the strong increase of the Nd/(Nd + Ti) atomic ratio, O/(Nd + Ti) did not vary much with respect to the O/Ti ratio of the pure TiO2 sample (S1). An attempt has been made to investigate the valence state of Nd in the films with high Nd concentration using AES, by analysing the MNN transition line shape and comparing them with that of neodymium and neodymium oxide. Unfortunately the difference between the MNN transition line shapes of Nd element (Nd0) and Nd2O3 (Nd3+) found in the (very scarce) literature are not significant and cannot constitute a precise method to define the valence state of neodymium.
3.2. Quantification of low neodymium content by XRF
Due to the constraint of detection limit in AES, the quantification of the Nd doped TiO2 sample (S2) was carried out by X-ray fluorescence. TiKα (KL2 and KL3 transitions) and NdLβ (L1M3 and L2M4 transitions) intensities were extracted by peak fitting with IAEA WinQXAS software.23,24 In order to perform the XRF a semi-quantitative analysis, a calibration curve was constructed on the basis of Nd concentrations obtained by AES measurements performed on samples S3–S5. Fig. 1(a) shows the X-ray fluorescence spectra measured for sample S2 on a quartz substrate. The NdLβ-to-TiKα count ratio was plotted against the AES determined weight fractions in Fig. 1(b). An exponential fit of the curve could be done, following the equation reported in the plot, from which an Nd/Ti atomic ratio could be derived for sample S2. The Nd/Ti atomic ratio is reported in Table 1.

3.3. Film structure from XRD analysis
The as-grown titania films were amorphous, as indicated by the XRD analysis (not shown here): no diffraction peak was observed. Fig. 2 shows the XRD spectra obtained for the undoped titania and for films doped with various amounts of neodymium grown on quartz substrates, after annealing at 600 °C in ambient air atmosphere. As clearly seen from the XRD measurements, the neodymium doping induced remarkable modification in the structural properties of the films. A pure titania thin film exhibits a crystalline structure corresponding to an anatase structure (ICDD card # 21-1272), indicated as “A”. In addition to the dominant structure A(101) located at 2θ = 25.36°, the peaks associated with the (103), (004) and (200) crystallographic planes were observed as well, although they were of very weak intensity. The strongest intensity of the (101) diffraction peak indicates a preferred oriented anatase polycrystalline structure. A very low incorporation of neodymium into the titania lattice produced dramatic changes in the crystallographic structure of the films. The XRD pattern of the film S2, deposited with Nd in an atomic ratio of 0.9% to Ti, exhibits both anatase and rutile structures, the latter indicated as “R”. The figure also reveals that the peaks slightly broaden indicating a deterioration of the crystallinity of the titania film. Much higher concentrations of Nd (samples S3 and S4) produced a further intensity reduction and an increase of the FWHM of the peaks. The anatase and rutile relative amounts changed remarkably with the Nd concentration: the intensity ratio between the A(101) and R(110) peaks varies from 1.27 for the 0.9 at.% of the Nd/Ti ratio (sample S2) to 2.27 for the film with 5.5 at.% Nd/Ti (sample S3). The R(110) peak at 2θ = 27.4° for the film with Nd/Ti = 43% (sample S4) becomes nearly indistinguishable, only the A(101) peak remains, although with a very low signal-to-noise ratio. For the highest concentration of Nd (sample S5), no A(101) or R(110) signals were detected, the film appears amorphous (spectrum not shown). Additional peaks corresponding to Nd metal clusters or other mixed dopant oxides were not revealed by XRD analysis. The result shows that neodymium incorporation leads to the phase transformations (A → A + R) and also hinders crystal growth at higher dopant concentrations. Beside the peak broadening (FWHM = 0.567°), the A(101) peak position shows a positive shift of 0.07° with respect to that of bulk anatase (ICDD card # 21-1272 – shown as a vertical line in Fig. 2), which increases with the increasing Nd/Ti atomic ratio from 0.9% to 43% (samples S2 to S4), indicating the creation of an internal strain induced by Nd incorporation into the TiO2 matrix.

A Williamson–Hall plot, following eqn (1) was applied to the (101) peak and other peaks of much lower intensities of anatase corresponding to A(103), A(004) and A(200) (not shown) to determine the average crystallite size 〈D〉 and the strain η. The (101) and (200) anatase reflections were used to calculate the lattice parameters using eqn (2). Fig. 3 shows the dependence of the calculated lattice parameters (“a” and “c”) of the anatase phase when changing the Nd concentration, along with their ratio c/a, the cell volume (V), 〈D〉 and η.
 Fig. 3  Lattice parameters a (plot a), c (plot b) and c/a (plot c), cell volume V (plot d), average crystallite size 〈D〉 (plot e) and internal strain η (plot f) for anatase with various Nd-doping levels (the dashed line indicates a, c, and c/a values of bulk anatase, from standard ICDD card (# 21-1272)). The dotted line in plot (f) signs the zero-strain level). 
A small amount of Nd changed significantly the “c” and “a” parameters. “c” abruptly increased and “a” decreased when Nd was introduced in a ratio of 0.9% to Ti. The maximum elongation of ‘c’ axis was about 0.22 Å from 9.438 Å (for 0% Nd) to 9.661 Å (for Nd/Ti of 0.9 at.%). For further Nd additions, parameter “c” keeps increasing and parameter “a” decreasing. Neodymium doping induced lattice distortion in titania, also evidenced by the increase of the c/a ratio in plot (c) of Fig. 3. Due to the large difference of the ionic radii between the dopant (Nd: 0.983 Å) and the host Ti ions (Ti4+: 0.68 Å), the strong lattice expansion along the ‘c’ axis observed at lower Nd concentrations indicates that Nd ions enter the TiO2 lattice substitutionally. When the neodymium concentration increases, the lattice distortion, reflected in the c/a value, did not noticeably increase further suggesting that (i) the Nd cations might segregate at the grain boundaries without further substitution of Ti4+ ions and/or (ii) to accommodate an increase of substituted sites in TiO2 lattice, new defects might be created around the Nd ions. The latter hypothesis is rather corroborated by the evolution of the cell volume, which was maximum for the film with a Nd/Ti of 0.9%, concomitant with a compressive residual strain in the film, while for the more Nd-rich films, the cell volume tends to decrease as if the excess volume brought by Nd was compensated by O or Ti vacancies. The shifts in the 2θ values corresponding to the maximum intensity of the A(101) peak are well reflected in the variation of the residual strain with the Nd concentration plotted in Fig. 3, plot f. The films S1, S3 and S4 exhibited a tensile strain, while S2 a compressive one. This also correlates with the variation of the cell volume of the anatase phase of the films, as shown in Fig. 3, plot d. The higher cell volume value was for sample S2 and this can explain the occurrence of a compressive strain in the film. It should be kept in mind that many factors can contribute to the stress building in the sputter-deposited films: the film structure induced by the growth conditions (temperature, ion bombardment) and cell parameter mismatch between the film and substrate generates an intrinsic stress while a thermal expansion coefficient mismatch in the film–substrate system leads to an extrinsic stress. The TiO2 films grown onto silicon had a columnar structure (observed by scanning electron microscopy, not shown here). Such a structure is generally known to generate a tensile stress.25 The change of the final strain (stress) from tensile-to-compressive-to-tensile with an increase in the Nd concentration (observed in Fig. 3, plot f), which is also correlated with the change of the anatase cell volume, can be a valuable indication of the effective incorporation of Nd into the anatase cell.
On the other hand, the sign and intensity of the residual strain in the films influenced the grain growth. Higher the tensile strain, the larger the crystallite size. A compressive strain gave rise to the smallest crystallites. Moreover, in the films strained in tension (for pure TiO2 and for Nd/Ti = 5.5 and 43%), rutile phase formation seems to be hindered (Fig. 2), while the presence of compressive strain favored the anatase-to-rutile transformation (film S2 in Fig. 2 with Nd/Ti = 0.9 at.%).
3.4. Optical properties from transmittance and reflectance measurements
The optical analyses of these films were explored in order to study their optical bandgap. Pure TiO2 exhibits a strong absorption cut-off in the UV region around 370 nm which can be related to the band-gap absorption of titania. Fig. 4(a) and (b) show the transmittance and reflectance spectra of the annealed films. All the films were transparent with an optical transmittance of ≥70% in the visible region. The variation in transmittance and in the oscillations number is related to the increase in the thickness of the film and the progressive incorporation of Nd into the films. With the increase in dopant concentration, the absorption edge extended towards longer wavelengths. The Tauc's plot (with m = 2), shown in Fig. 4(c) illustrates these red shifts as the Nd concentration in the matrix is increased. The optical band gap decreases from 3.3 to 3.02 eV as the Nd to Ti ratio increases from 0 to Nd/Ti = 100%. This phenomenon is consistent with the work of Zhao et al.26 and of Li et al.27 which reported similar red-shifts in the band gap of TiO2 nanoparticles induced by Nd3+ doping. Such bandgap narrowing was attributed to new unoccupied electron states in the gap below the conduction band edge due to the location of Nd ions in substitutional sites in the TiO2 matrix. In fact, the reduction of the bandgap with increasing Nd incorporation into the films was found to correlate well with the lattice distortions reflected in the c/a parameter ratio, as shown in Fig. 5, where both c/a and the gap are plotted as functions of Nd/Ti in the films: the higher c/a, the lower the optical gap, as also illustrated in the inset. In turn the c/a parameter ratio is strongly determined by the “c” parameter value, as can be seen in Fig. 3 (plot b), related to the Nd incorporation in the TiO2 lattice.

3.5. Luminescence spectroscopy: emission spectra, decay and energy transfer
Photoluminescence (PL) investigations of intra-configurational 4f emission from Nd ions in the titania host were systematically studied with respect to different excitation regimes: (1) direct excitation of the ion at different excitation wavelengths: green (514.5 nm), blue green (496 nm) and blue (476 nm) at a constant power and (2) non-resonant or indirect excitation in UV (355 nm).
In a first step, we investigated the optical activity of the incorporated Nd in the host titania. Room temperature PL emission spectra were recorded for TiO2 thin films doped with different concentrations of Nd at the excitation wavelength of 514.5 nm (2.41 eV) which is located in the non-absorbing region of the titania matrix. Strong near infra-red PL was observed pertaining to the transitions from the 4F3/2 state to the 4I9/2 (around 904 nm) and 4I11/2 (around 1094 nm) states, respectively, as shown in Fig. 6(a). Whatever the excitation wavelength, no Nd related PL luminescence was observed in the as-deposited samples, but only in the annealed samples. Since the excitation wavelength in this case is below the bandgap, we conclude that the excitation is direct from the ground state to one of the upper excited states around 514.5 nm (4G7/2, 4G9/2). Thereafter, the electrons decay back to the 4F3/2 state, from which they relax down to the 4IJ (J = 9/2, 11/2, 13/2) states, with the emission of photons of characteristic wavelengths. For all the samples, the excitation power was 1.1 W, except for the film S2 with Nd/Ti = 0.9% for which a power of 0.32 W was used. As the luminescence of the sample S2 was much stronger than for the other samples, the excitation power was reduced to 0.32 W in order not to saturate the detectors (both the PMT and Si detector). The spectra of all the Nd-doped films are displayed in Fig. 6(a) (spectrum for film S2 reduced by a factor 3) and can be compared. The spectrum was reduced because the signal intensity of the sample S2 was much higher than for the other samples. Actually even when the excitation power was reduced to 0.32 W the signal was still about three times stronger than for the other samples. In the series S3–S5, the PL intensity at ∼900 nm decreases with the increase in Nd concentration, this indicates that with the increase of Nd content, the quenching effect becomes important. In the same series, broad emission bands are observed. In contrast, for the lowest Nd concentration (Nd/Ti = 0.9%, sample S2), the PL spectrum reveals the fine splitting effect. The 4F3/2 to 4I11/2 transition, at ∼1094 nm, is depressed in intensity due to the low response of the detector in this spectral region. Fig. 6(b) presents the PL spectra as a function of various excitation wavelengths at a constant incident power (0.56 W) for sample S2. Neither shifting in the peak positions nor broadening was observed in the PL emission while the intensity of the emission peak gradually increased with the increase of the excitation energy. The PL intensity is much stronger for the excitation wavelength 476 nm (2.6 eV); while no great change was observed in the splitting of the emission line. Upon different excitation energy levels, eight PL lines in the 4F3/2 to 4I9/2 band and five PL lines in the region 4F3/2 to 4I11/2 were observed.

The Nd-doped films were further tested for the frequency down-shifting effect, by excitation in UV, at energies above the band gap of the titania matrix (at 355 nm, 3.49 eV). Fig. 7(a) shows the PL emission spectra in the near IR region upon excitation at 355 nm (less than 0.01 W) for samples S3 and S4. The characteristic NIR luminescence band centered at 902 nm (4F3/2 to 4I9/2) was observed for the sample S3 (Nd/Ti = 5.5%). The observation of this emission upon excitation shows the existence of efficient energy transfer (ET) from the electron–hole pairs created in the titania host matrix to the Nd ions. Only broad emission bands were observed. The same can be said for the sample S4; the spectrum is even broader. There is a complete absence of well resolved crystal-field-split (CF) Stark lines. This may be due to poor incorporation and inhomogeneities in the rare earth ion environment.28,29 As we see when the concentration is increased moving from sample S3 to sample S5 (Nd/Ti increasing from 5.5% to 100%), the predominant PL emission intensity was drastically lowered to become undetectable for sample S5 (not shown here). This can be attributed to the quenching effect at high Nd concentrations, resulting from the enhanced cross-relaxation process. Upon excitation at 355 nm, the Nd PL peak at ∼1094 nm (4F3/2 to 4I11/2) could not be observed because the fundamental harmonic of the Nd-YAG laser falls at 1064 nm (as the excitation was done with the third harmonic of the laser at 355 nm) and in our luminescence setup we were not able to completely remove the unwanted fundamental harmonic of the laser which completely overshadows the much weaker PL signal. The PL spectrum obtained for the sample S2 was different in terms of both signal intensity which was much higher and the Stark splitting which was more pronounced. This can be explained by the fact that the Nd concentration is beyond the optimum doping limit for the samples S3 and S4 having the Nd/Ti atomic ratio 5.5% and 43%, which led to luminescence quenching. Fig. 7(b) shows the representative emission spectra recorded in NIR for sample S2 excited at 355 nm with a pumping power less than 10 mW on the sample. Although the excitation power was considerably reduced, this sample showed strong luminescence. Two emission bands centered at 906 nm and 1094.5 nm corresponding to the 4F3/2 to 4I9/2 and 4I11/2 transitions with fine CF splitting are distinguishable. The 4F3/2 to 4I9/2 transition covers the 870–970 nm region with six well resolved components and the region from 1040–1150 nm is covered by 4F3/2 to 4I11/2 transition with three resolved Stark splittings. Here the luminescence peak for the 4F3/2 to 4I11/2 transition appears at 1094.5 nm due to the different chemical environment of the Nd ions in the matrix. In this process, the tetragonal titania will act as an effective light harvester to absorb UV photons and subsequently transfer energy to Nd and thereby resulting in the typical luminescence of the Nd ion. Similarly, Fix et al. recently reported on luminescence properties of Nd-doped SrTiO3, showing the Nd-related near-infrared luminescence bands and a photon down-shifting process through energy transfer from the SrTiO3 host matrix by exciting at 325 nm.30
 Fig. 7  Photoluminescence spectra of Nd doped TiO2 films on quartz substrates (a) indirect excitation – UV 355 nm for different concentrations (sample S3 and S4) and (b) indirect excitation – 355 nm for Nd doped TiO2 with Nd/Ti = 0.9% (sample S2). 
This implies that excitation energy transfer from the matrix to the rare-earth dopant can be achieved by exciting with energy close to the band gap energy of the host and within appropriate doping limits. Luo et al. also reported that the most intense band for the above transition appeared at 1093.7 nm when Nd3+ is incorporated into the anatase titania nanocrystals.4 Although the transition from 4F3/2 to 4I11/2 is known as the strongest transition of Nd, the 906 nm emission line showed a very strong intensity and the same was observed in the case of Nd-doped Si nanoclusters.31
The PL emission spectra obtained with 355 nm excitation differs greatly from spectra with other excitation wavelengths 514.5, 496 and 476 nm for 0.9%. There are noticeable differences in the peak locations, line shapes, PL intensities and the crystal field splitting effects. This indicates the existence of multiple luminescence centers of Nd ions within the TiO2 matrix.12 Different resonant direct excitations (at 476, 496 and 514.5 nm) with the transition of Nd can selectively excite particular Nd sites in TiO2 matrix whereas the 355 nm excited emission spectrum is the superposition of all emissions from various subsets of Nd sites in titania. Therefore, multiple luminescent site emissions of Nd are detected upon excitation above the titania bandgap. The emission pattern is different from that of Nd in Nd2O3 nanocrystals32 with respect to peak positions and shapes, which suggests that, if present, Nd2O3 should be in an amorphous phase, as XRD did not detect it. The reason for showing these two spectra (Fig. 7(a) and (b)) separately is that for the samples S3 and S4 the signal intensity was much lower than for the sample S2. So in order to put them in the same figure we would have to reduce the spectrum of S2 by a large factor (it is difficult to compare the spectra since the excitation power was very low and difficult to measure [due to lack of an appropriate power meter as the power is less than 10 mW], but we would say that the factor is at least 10).
Taking into account the PL properties analyzed above, the possible argument of efficient energy transfer (from host titania to Nd ion) can be proposed via defect related levels. There are number of models treating the energy transfer from the host to RE ions. Frindell et al.8 and Xin et al.33 proposed a model for the energy transfer via relaxation to defect states on titania before the energy is transferred to the rare earth ion. In our study the predominant energy mediating defects of reduced titania might be the existence of oxygen deficiencies by the substitutional doping of Nd in the TiO2 lattice, as the evolution of the anatase cell parameter and volume with Nd incorporation suggested too (Fig. 3). Hence we presume the energy transfer process between reduced TiO2−x and Nd as follows: the above-band-gap excitation of titania leads to the transition of electrons in the TiO2 matrix from the valence band to the conduction band. The recombination energy of the electron–hole pair generated in the titania host is non-radiatively transferred to the excited states of the Nd ions, followed by nonradiative relaxation to 4F3/2 of Nd, thereby NIR emissions of Nd take place. Alternatively, some of the electrons in the conduction band can also be trapped by the defects in titania; hence on recombination of electrons in the defect state with the photogenerated holes titania can also transfer its energy to the excited states of the Nd ions. In this case, the energy transfer from the matrix to the acceptor ion is not a simple level to level transition, but is a more complicated energy transfer involving defect states inside the band gap. To be able to estimate the transfer efficiency we would have to measure the dependence of the luminescence decay for such a defect related state in the presence and absence of neodymium.
4. Conclusions
In summary, the influence of Nd doping on the nanostructured titania thin films deposited via RF sputtering at room temperature was investigated. The following conclusions were drawn from this study:
A. From the structural and optical point of view
(a) We observed that the doping with low concentration of Nd induces the co-existence of both anatase and rutile phases even with the addition of a large amount of neodymium in the titania matrix (up to 43% Nd/Ti atomic ratio).
(b) Incorporation of a low concentration of neodymium (0.9% Nd/Ti atomic ratio) leads to the remarkable lattice distortion along the c-axis in anatase which reveals that Nd ions are in substitutional site, further increase in the Nd concentration (from Nd/Ti equals 5.5 at.% to 100 at.%) resulted in an increasing amorphization. For large doping, the incorporation of Nd is more likely in the amorphous phase of titania. The formation of the neodymium oxide phase was not evidenced, though not excluded.
(c) For higher Nd concentrations, there is no remarkable change in the c/a ratio of anatase at the same time we have amorphisation of the rutile phase.
(d) Addition of neodymium dopant also shows significant variation in terms of absorbance and the bandgap of the material. Specifically, red-shift of the absorption band edge and the bandgap reduction were observed in the case of low concentration (0.9% Nd/Ti at. ratio) which concludes that Nd ions are in the substitutional site.
B. From the photoluminescence study
(a) The PL properties both in resonant and non-resonant excitation have been investigated. In general the downshifting luminescence emission intensity depends upon the doping concentration, crystal structure and size dependent properties.
(b) An appreciable effect has been observed under the indirect excitation of titania (through UV), the maximum NIR PL emission intensity through an effective defect mediated energy transfer from the host titania matrix with resolved crystal field splitting was obtained for low doping concentration (0.9% Nd/Ti at. ratio) of Nd ions as in the substitutional site. Quenching of PL emission intensity was observed for higher doping concentrations of Nd ions (from 5.5–100 at.% Nd/Ti ratio) because of the cross-relaxation process and also the poor incorporation of neodymium into the TiO2 matrix, which is imperative for the occurrence of efficient energy transfer.
