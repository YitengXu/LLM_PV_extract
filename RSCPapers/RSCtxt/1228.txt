Therefore, suppressing the defect formation and passivating the pre-existing defects in perovskite materials are of paramount importance in pushing the efficiency of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) toward the theoretical limit and ensuring the long-term stability of PSCs. In this work, we report an efficient defect passivation route using a bidentate small organic molecule, pyrazine, which is capable of making either a monodentate or a bridging bidentate bond with under-coordinated Pb2+ ions mainly present in the surface and grain boundaries of perovskite films. The various analyses for the defect density and charge carrier lifetime of perovskite light absorbing layers demonstrated that pyrazine effectively passivated defects existing on the surface and grain boundaries of the perovskite films without affecting the morphology and crystallinity via a simple post-treatment procedure. As a result, the best untreated device obtained a power conversion efficiency of 19.14%, while an efficiency of 20.58% was achieved when pyrazine treated.
Introduction
Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites have attracted much attention as an exciting semiconductor material in optoelectronic fields. Perovskite materials have superior optoelectronic properties for photovoltaic applications such as a high absorption coefficient, long carrier lifetime, tunable bandgap, and high electron and hole mobility.1–9 With these advantages, PSCs have achieved a certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of >25%, comparable to their silicon and inorganic based thin film solar cell counterparts. Nevertheless, there is still room to further push its efficiency toward the theoretical limit of 30.5% with a bandgap of 1.6 eV, which was reported by Bongiovanni et al.10 One feasible way is to improve the open-circuit voltage (VOC), which is strongly correlated with the defect-mediated recombination. Defects such as under-coordinated ions at the edges of a solution processed perovskite crystal lattice were reported to reduce the carrier lifetime and open-circuit voltage (VOC) of PSCs by causing non-radiative recombination.11–13 Solution processed perovskite films inevitably result in a heterogeneous polycrystalline nature, which leads to form more surface and grain boundaries and higher charge trapping density than single crystal perovskite.14–17 Recently, some reports have shown improvement in the properties of PSCs by controlling the defects in perovskites.18 To reduce defects, many researchers used various routes such as additives and post-synthesis treatments. Additives such as chloride and thiocyanate were found to enhance the performance of PSCs by controlling the grain size and reducing the grain boundaries where defects are mainly present.19,20 Small organic molecule Lewis base additives such as pyridine, thiophene and benzylamine were exploited to passivate defects at the surface and grain boundaries through post-treatment.21,22 In particular, these materials have been used to fill the insufficient negative charge of under-coordinated Pb2+ ions acting as trapping sites of charge carriers in polycrystalline perovskite films.
Here, we exploit a simple bidentate organic molecule, pyrazine (Pyr), to chemically passivate the surface and grain boundaries of polycrystalline perovskite. It can be envisaged that pyrazine not only passivates the defects of the perovskite surface like other monodentate passivation agents but also stitches the two under-coordinated Pb2+ ions of neighboring grains by forming the bridging bidentate bond. Thus, pyrazine enhanced the charge carrier life of perovskites three times more than that of untreated PSCs, thanks to its strong and efficient passivation effects, which resulted in an improvement in VOC and PCE up to 30 mV and 6%, respectively, compared to those from the untreated device.
Results and discussion
Zhu et al. performed a thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of a PbI2–(ligand)x complex to investigate the binding capacity of various passivation materials with the under-coordinated Pb2+ ion.23 In this study, we used pyrazine, a bidentate material that can make a bridging bidendtate bond with under-coordinated Pb2+ ions (Fig. 1a). A PbI2–(pyrazine)x complex was synthesized to analyze the binding capacity of under-coordinated Pb2+ ions and pyrazine by using a method reported by Zhu et al. (Fig. S1†). The colors of the PbI2–(pyrazine)x complex and PbI2 were slightly different, indicating that pyrazine interacted with Pb2+ ions. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of the PbI2–(pyrazine)x complex was carried out as shown in Fig. S2.† The elimination of pyrazine starts at 125 °C, which is much higher than those from monodentate organic molecules such as pyridine and p-toluenethiol. This result demonstrates that the bridging bidentate pyrazine can make a more robust binding with Pb relative to the monodentate pyridine and p-toluenethiol.

Herein, we follow a simple post-treatment procedure to passivate defects present at the surface and grain boundaries of the perovskite (Fig. 1b). First, we varied the concentration of the pyrazine solution (1 mg Pyr, 20 mg Pyr, and 50 mg Pyr/1 ml IPA) to check how it influences the morphology of perovskite layers. Fig. S3† shows the cross sectional scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of perovskite films treated with pyrazine solutions. The morphology of the perovskite film treated with a low concentration (1 mg Pyr/1 ml IPA) pyrazine solution was almost identical to that of the pristine film. However, as the concentration of the pyrazine solution increases, the structure of the perovskite layer begins to collapse preferentially along the grain boundary. These results suggest that pyrazine molecules bind to the Pb2+ ions preferentially present in the surface and grain boundaries. We optimized the concentration of the pyrazine solution within a range that kept the morphology similar to that of the pristine perovskite. The pyrazine solutions (0.5 mg Pyr, 1 mg Pyr, and 2 mg Pyr/1 ml IPA) were investigated to check their effects on the properties of perovskite films. The devices with and without pyrazine post-treatment were labeled Pyr-treated and untreated, respectively.
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) were performed to investigate the effect of pyrazine treatment on the morphology and crystallinity of the perovskite films. Fig. 2 shows a surface SEM image of untreated and Pyr-treated perovskite films. The grain sizes were found to be in the range of 400–700 nm regardless of pyrazine treatment. The SEM results indicated that pyrazine post-treatment did not significantly alter the grain size and overall morphology. The XRD patterns of untreated and Pyr-treated perovskite films are shown in Fig. S4.† The peak at 12.7° is due to the remnant PbI2. The peaks at 14.0° and 24.3° are the (001) and (111) planes of the perovskite lattice, respectively.24,25 The full-width at half maximum (FWHM) for the (111) plane of untreated and Pyr-treated perovskite was almost identical (Table S1†). Moreover, no separate peaks from the PbI2–(pyrazine)x complex are identified, indicating the full inclusion of pyrazine moieties into vacancies. These results reinforce that the pyrazine treatment retains the crystallinity of the perovskite layer. The ultraviolet-visible spectra (UV-vis) of untreated and Pyr-treated perovskite films are shown in Fig. S5.† The absorption spectra of untreated and Pyr-treated perovskite films were almost the same. The results of UV-vis spectra are in agreement with the SEM and XRD results that Pyr treatment does not alter the fundamental properties of the perovskite films.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was conducted to further verify the presence of pyrazine on the perovskite films. The XPS N1s data and compositions for N1s of untreated and Pyr-treated perovskite films are shown in Fig. 3a and Table S2.† As shown in Fig. 3a, the N1s peak intensity was increased as the more pyrazine was treated in the perovskite layer, indicating the successful inclusion of pyrazine into the under-coordinated Pb2+ defect sites. Accordingly, the atomic percent of nitrogen increased from 11.21% in untreated perovskite up to 17.6% in 2 mg ml−1 Pyr treated perovskite, as shown in Table S2.† In addition, the binding energies of Pb4f7/2 and Pb4f5/2 of Pyr-treated perovskites were shifted toward lower energy compared with those of untreated perovskite. While the binding energies of Pb4f7/2 and Pb4f5/2 of untreated perovskites were 138.46 eV and 143.36 eV, these values of 0.5 mg ml−1 Pyr-treated perovskite were shifted to 138.58 eV and 143.43 eV. When more pyrazine was treated such as 1.0 mg ml−1 and 2.0 mg ml−1, these values were further shifted toward lower energy as shown in Fig. 3b. The shifting of the Pb4f peaks to lower energy means that the positive charge around the Pb2+ ion is screened by the coordination bonding of pyrazine. Pyr-treated perovskite has fewer under-coordinated Pb2+ than untreated, indicating that the defects were passivated by pyrazine treatment.26,27

We examined the effect of pyrazine treatment on the performance of PSCs. The devices consisted of ITO/SnO2/perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au for this experiment (Fig. 4a). PSCs have layers of 20 nm SnO2, 600 nm perovskite, 140 nm Spiro-OMeTAD, and 800 nm Au. Except for solution preparation which was done in a N2-filled glove box, all other processes proceeded under dry air (<10%) conditions. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves for the best performing devices are shown in Fig. 4b, and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table S3.† The untreated best device showed a JSC of 22.43 mA cm−2, VOC of 1.092 V and fill factor of 78.2% with a PCE of 19.14%, while the device treated with 0.5 mg ml−1 pyrazine achieved a JSC of 22.83 mA cm−2, VOC of 1.133 V and fill factor of 79.5% with a PCE of 20.58%. To check the solvent effect on device performance during the post treatment, we performed a post treatment procedure identical to Pyr treatment except for using the isopropanol solvent only. The best performing device with only IPA treatment showed a JSC of 22.31 mA cm−2, VOC of 1.050 V and fill factor of 75.2% with a PCE of 17.62%. All parameters from the solvent-only treated device were inferior compared to those of the untreated device. This result indicates that the improvement in the device is due to pyrazine treatment, not solvent effects. The main factor in improving the performance upon passivating the perovskite layer with pyrazine is the increase of open-circuit voltage (VOC). The passivation efficacy of pyrazine also shows the concentration dependence. Further increase of the pyrazine concentration over 0.5 mg ml−1 was found to be detrimental to the device performance. Thus, the optimum concentration of pyrazine in this study was 0.5 mg ml−1. Fig. 4c shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the 0.5 mg ml−1 Pyr-treated best performing device, while that of the other Pyr-treated devices is shown in Fig. S6.† The integrated JSC was 22.65 mA cm−2, which was well matched with 22.83 mA cm−2 of the photovoltaic parameter. Fig. S7† shows the J–V hysteresis of untreated and Pyr-treated best performing devices. All devices show almost no hysteresis. To verify reproducibility, we fabricated fourteen cells for each condition, and the averages and statistics of the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are shown in Table 1 and Fig. S8.† The average JSC value was almost identical for these devices. However, the VOC and fill factor of 0.5 mg ml−1 Pyr-treated devices increased compared to untreated devices, resulting in a higher efficiency. We tracked the steady-state photocurrent of the 0.5 mg ml−1 Pyr treated device under 0.914 V as shown in Fig. 4d, establishing a stable power conversion efficiency of 19.54%.

Defects at the surface or grain boundaries of the perovskite film have been considered responsible for degradation of the perovskite layer either by trapping charges and water molecules or by providing a pathway for ion migration.28,29 Thus, we investigated the stability of untreated and Pyr treated devices without encapsulation under an ambient atmosphere at 55 °C. As shown Fig. S9,† the PCE of the untreated device starts to decrease rapidly after 20 h storage and reaches 70% of the initial value after 50 h. In contrast, the Pyr-treated device maintains over 90% of the initial PCE even after aging for 50 h at 55 °C. The improved stability of the treated device is attributed to passivation of defects and suppressed ion migration by monodentate and bridging bidentate binding of Pyr with under-coordinated Pb2+ defects on the surface and grain boundaries of the perovskite.
To further confirm the passivation effect of pyrazine, we monitored the steady-state photoluminescence (PL) of the perovskite films as shown in Fig. 5a. We noted that the PL intensities are greatly enhanced after 0.5 mg ml−1 pyrazine post-treatment followed by a slight decrease with a further increase of the pyrazine concentration. The PL intensity strongly correlates with the defect-mediated non-radiative recombination. The lower the non-radiative recombination losses, the stronger the PL intensity. Thus, the result from the steady-state PL reinforces that pyrazine indeed reduces the charge trap sites leading to suppression of recombination in the perovskite layer.

The charge recombination dynamics were monitored by the time-resolved PL(TRPL) of perovskite films. The PL decay traces were fitted with the bi-exponential function (Fig. 5b) (bi-exponential formula: I(t) = A1exp(−t/τ1) + A2exp(−t/τ2) + B, A1 and A2: the relative amplitude fraction, τ1: fast decay time, τ2: slow decay time).30 Table S4† shows the extracted values of TRPL traces. The improvement in the slow component τ2 with Pyr is ascribed to the improved radiative recombination lifetime of the photogenerated free charge carriers. In contrast, the dominant trap-mediated recombination is related to the ultrafast component τ1 of the PL trace,31 which is the lowest when Pyr is low (0.5–1.0 mg ml−1). As a result, Pyr-treated perovskite films have an average carrier lifetime four times longer than that of untreated perovskite films, indicating that pyrazine reduced charge trap density.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed to investigate the charge transport process and contact resistance. Fig. 5c shows the Nyquist plots of the untreated and 0.5 mg ml−1 Pyr-treated devices as measured at 0.8 V under 0.1 Sun illumination. The simplified equivalent circuit consisted of the Rs, the contact resistance (Rco) and the recombination resistance (Rrec) in the PSCs. Rs is the series resistance related to electrodes. The Rrec and Rco correspond to the recombination in PSCs and the diffusion of the interface with the hole transport layer, respectively.32,33 The Rco and Rrec of the untreated device were 16.3 Ω and 222.6 Ω, while the Rco and Rrec of the Pyr-treated device were 14.6 Ω and 257 Ω. The contact resistance of untreated and Pyr-treated devices did not show any clear difference. The recombination resistance of the Pyr-treated device is higher than that of the untreated one, indicating that Pyr-treatment decreases charge recombination on the perovskite film.
The light intensity dependence of VOC was measured to confirm charge recombination kinetics (Fig. 6a). Deviation of the slope from kBT/q is related to trap-assisted recombination, which is calculated with the formula  (n is the ideality factor, kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature and q is an elementary charge). The Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) recombinant dynamics indicate that the higher slope (ε > 1) reflects a more significant trap density of the PSCs.34,35 The slope of the untreated is 1.83kBT/q, while the Pyr-treated device shows a smaller slope (1.69kBT/q).

In addition, Fig. 6b shows the dark J–V curves of untreated and Pyr-treated devices. The ideality factor of the devices was calculated using the dark saturation current density of the dark J–V curves and the diode equation (: n is the ideality factor, kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, J0 is the dark current density, and q is an elementary charge). The Pyr-treated device having a higher VOC shows consistently a lower J0, as shown in Fig. 6b. The dark current density (J0) values of the untreated and Pyr-treated devices were 1.92 × 10−6 mA cm−2 and 2.20 × 10−8 mA cm−2, respectively. The deviation of the ideality factor is also related to charge recombination.35–38 The untreated device shows an n value of 2.83, while the Pyr-treated device shows a much smaller value of 1.89. These results proved that the recombination has largely been suppressed in the perovskite layer by Pyr treatment. Thus, this result was also in good agreement with the results of higher VOC for Pyr-treated devices than for untreated devices.
We further measured the space charge limited current (SCLC) of electron-only devices (ITO/SnO2/perovskite/PCBM/Au) under dark conditions to determine the charge trap density of perovskite (Fig. 6c and d). The dark J–V curves of the electron-only device consist of three regimes: (1) a linear ohmic regime at low bias related to the electrical conductivity (σ), (2) the trap-filled regime to estimate the trap density at middle bias and (3) trap-free SCLC regime to determine the charge mobility at high bias. The trap-filled limit voltage (VTFL) is the voltage at which the trap-filled regime begins to appear. The trap density of perovskite was calculated by using the formula  (ε is the dielectric constant of the relative perovskite, ε0 is the vacuum permittivity, q is an elementary charge, and L is the thickness of the perovskite film).34,35,39 We use a dielectric constant of 47 because this perovskite mainly consists of FAPbI3.40 The VTFL and the ntrap of the untreated device were 0.533 V and 7.69 × 1015 cm−3, while the VTFL and the ntrap of the Pyr-treated device were 0.281 V and 4.05 × 1015 cm−3. These results support that perovskite films with pyrazine treatment have a lower charge trap.
Conclusion
In summary, we demonstrated that defect sites acting as a charge trap and non-radiative recombination can be effectively passivated by a simple post-synthesis treatment of the perovskite films with a bidentate pyrazine moiety. The various experimental results proved that pyrazine post-treatment reduces the charge trap sites without affecting the morphology and crystallinity of perovskite films. This represents a different result from previous passivation studies of perovskite films that are generally accompanied by the uncontrollable change of the morphology and crystallinity of perovskite films. The pyrazine has two nitrogen binding sites, which can bind either as a monodentate mode or as a bridging bidentate mode. Our research has the advantage of maintaining the morphology and crystallinity of perovskite films and intensively passivating charge traps that degrade the performance of PSCs. Thus, the results shown in this study pave the way to improve the performance of PSCs.
Experimental
Fabrication of PSCs
ITO substrates were washed in deionized water, acetone and ethanol by sonication for 15 min, respectively. Then, the ITO substrates were cleaned with a plasma cleaner for 10 min. The SnO2 nanoparticle solution (4%, diluted with deionized water) was spin-coated onto the ITO substrate at 4000 rpm for 30 s and annealed at 150 °C for 30 min in ambient air. The following spin-coating and annealing were performed in a dry box (<10% humidity). The perovskite film was deposited by the two-step method. 1.3 M PbI2 in DMF:DMSO (95:5, volume ratio) was spin-coated onto the SnO2 nanoparticle film at 1500 rpm for 30 s and annealed at 70 °C for 1 min. For the fabrication of the perovskite film, a solution of FAI:MABr:MACl (60 mg:6 mg:6 mg in 1 ml IPA) was spin-coated onto the PbI2 film at 1300 rpm for 30 s and annealed at 150 °C for 15 min. For pyrazine passivation, pyrazine with different concentrations (0.5 mg, 1 mg, and 2 mg in 1 ml IPA) was spin-coated onto the perovskite layer at 4000 rpm for 30 s and heated at 100 °C for 10 min. The hole transport layer was deposited on the perovskite layer by spin-coating at 2500 rpm for 30 s with a solution that consisted of 56 mg Spiro-OMeTAD, 30 μl 4-tertbutylpyridine, 6 mg bis(trifluoromethane) sulfonamide lithium salt and 1 ml chlorobenzene. Finally, an 80 nm Au electrode was deposited by thermal evaporation under a high vacuum.
Synthesis of the PbI2–pyrazine complex
0.6 M PbI2 and 1.8 M pyrazine were dissolved in DMF. The prepared solutions were mixed and stirred at room temperature for 30 min. The PbI2–pyrazine complex was deposited after mixing the solutions. The mixed solution was blended with a large amount of toluene. The precipitate was separated and washed with toluene several times and vacuum-dried at room temperature for 12 hours.
Characterization
The decomposition temperature of the PbI2–pyrazine complex is obtained by using Q500 TA instruments (heating rate: 5 °C min−1, temperature maximum: 400 °C, atmosphere gas: N2). The thickness of each layer and surface morphology of the perovskite films were analyzed by using a scanning electron microscope (SEM, Hitachi, S-4800). The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the perovskite films were obtained on a D/MAX-2500 with a CuKα radiation source (λ = 1.5406 Å, at 40 kV, 100 mA). The absorption spectra of the perovskite films were obtained with an ultraviolet-visible spectrometer (UV-vis, Shimadzu, UV-2600). The X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were measured using an XPS system (Thermo Fisher Scientific K-Alpha+). For charge compensation, the highest peak of the measured C1s peak in the sample is C–C bonding, and all peaks have been normalized by shifting this peak to fit 284.8 eV. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves were obtained using a computer-controlled digital source meter (Keithley, 2420) under standard AM 1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2) with a solar simulator (Abet, S2000). The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra were measured with a Spectral IPCE measurement system (McScience, K3100). The steady-state photoluminescence (PL) of the perovskite films was measured using a LabRAM HR Evolution Visible_NIR. The lifetimes were measured with a time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectrometer (PicoQuant GmbH). The electrochemical impedance spectra are obtained by using a potentiostat (BioLogic, VSP).
