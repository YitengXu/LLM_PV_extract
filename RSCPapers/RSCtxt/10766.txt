    , Accepted 20th March 2019First published on 21st March 2019AbstractThe development of efficient electrocatalysts catalyzing the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media is highly desirable for large-scale hydrogen production from water splitting. Here it is shown that surface reconstruction of cobalt cyclotetraphosphate (Co2P4O12) accelerated by titanium oxide (TiO2) dramatically enhances HER and OER activity in alkaline solution. TiO2 promotes the formation of metallic cobalt at the TiO2|Co2P4O12 interface in the HER. The resultant composite generates a current density of 20 mA cm−2 at an overpotential of 81 mV in the alkaline HER, and the overpotential is 157 mV smaller than that of pristine Co2P4O12. The activity outperforms that of most non-precious metal electrocatalysts. The synergetic effect between Co, TiO2, and Co2P4O12 reduces the energy barrier of both the Volmer step and Heyrovsky step, inducing performance enhancement. The composite produces a current density of 20 mA cm−2 at an overpotential of 330 mV in the OER, and the overpotential is 87 mV smaller than that of pristine Co2P4O12. The utilization of the composite as a bifunctional electrocatalyst in full water splitting cell is also demonstrated.
1. Introduction
The development of clean and renewable energy has been motivated by the energy crisis, environmental pollution, and global warming all associated with the wide use of fossil fuels. Hydrogen produced by clean energy (e.g., wind electricity and solar electricity) driven electrochemical water splitting not only acts as a clean and renewable energy source, but also becomes a promising medium for massive energy storage necessitated by intermittent and fluctuant wind and solar electricity and the balance of power-grid peak and valley. Electrochemical water splitting includes the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), both necessitating electrocatalysts to reduce corresponding overpotential. Economical water splitting should produce hydrogen in low-cost and high yield. Unfortunately, the most efficient electrocatalysts required for high yield hydrogen production remain scarce and are expensive noble metal based materials (e.g., Pt for the HER and RuO2 for the OER). Inexpensive, highly active, and long-term stable non-precious metal electrocatalysts are extremely desired to accelerate the commercialization of clean and renewable hydrogen production.
Alkaline electrolyzers are the industry standard for water electrolysis, offering the advantages of simplicity and durability.1 However, most HER electrocatalysts work more efficiently under acidic conditions than basic conditions. The mismatch of optimal pH ranges between HER and OER electrocatalysts results in inferior overall water splitting efficiency and makes complicated the integration of the cathode and anode of water splitting devices. A less efficient HER in alkaline media is associated with a slow water dissociation process on the surface of electrocatalysts. Efforts have been devoted to promoting water dissociation by loading hetero-particles (e.g., Ni(OH)2,2,3 CeO2,4 or TiO2 (ref. 5 and 6)) on the surface of HER electrocatalysts, whereas the performance of resultant composites remains unsatisfactory.
Bifunctional electrocatalysts that simultaneously catalyze the alkaline HER and OER become certainly desirable because of the reduction of fabrication cost, whereas most electrocatalysts are good for only the HER or OER. So far a limited amount of bifunctional electrocatalysts have been reported, including metal phosphides,7,8 metal chalcogenides,9,10 and metal oxide/hydroxides.11,12 These electrocatalysts usually have less competitive performance than noble-metal-based catalytic couples. The development of high performance bifunctional electrocatalysts remains a big challenge, and is therefore a vital research topic in this field.
Although transition metal phosphates are highly active electrocatalysts for the alkaline OER,13 their catalytic activity in the HER has rarely been reported. Cobo et al. showed that the overpotential of cobalt phosphate is as large as 385 mV for a current density of 2 mA cm−2.14 On the other hand, phosphates are usually formed on the surface of phosphides because of air exposure,15,16 and the presence of inactive phosphate screens the active sites of phosphide from water molecules, reducing the number of active sites in basic solution.17 Therefore, the common activation process of electrocatalysts (e.g., defect engineering and heteroatom doping) which was carried out during synthesis cannot guarantee their validity after the formation of surface phosphate, raising a big challenge in promoting the alkaline HER of phosphides and the efficiency of overall water splitting.
Herein we report that both HER and OER performance of cobalt cyclotetraphosphate (Co2P4O12) in alkaline media can be markedly improved via titanium oxide (TiO2) loading. The overpotential required to drive 20 mA cm−2 is as small as 81 mV in the HER. The performance is comparative to that of Pt/C. TiO2 was found to accelerate the surface reduction of Co2P4O12 to metallic cobalt (Co), and enhanced performance is associated with the synergetic effect between Co, Co2P4O12, and TiO2. The Co2P4O12 loaded with TiO2 (TiO2@Co2P4O12) can also effectively catalyze the OER in alkaline media, producing a current density of 20 mA cm−2 at an over potential of 330 mV. Because of the reversible transformation of cobalt species under HER and OER conditions, TiO2@Co2P4O12 can act as a reversible bifunctional electrocatalyst for water splitting. The results introduced here present a novel and efficient bifunctional water splitting electrocatalyst and also a promising approach to promote the performance of metal phosphides in alkaline media.
2. Results and discussion
2.1 Structural and morphological characterization of TiO2@Co2P4O12
The synthesis process of TiO2@Co2P4O12 is schematically illustrated in Fig. 1a. The precursor ink containing polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and cobaltous chloride (CoCl2·6H2O) was drop-cast onto the surface of carbon fiber paper (CFP). The resultant CFP was then annealed in a nitrogen (N2) atmosphere, and the precursor ink was converted to a particle film of cobalt hydroxide chloride (Co2(OH)3Cl), as shown by the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern (Fig. S1 in the ESI‡). Afterward, the Co2(OH)3Cl was phosphatized into cobalt cyclotetraphosphate (Co2P4O12) using sodium hypophosphite (NaH2PO2). The typical loading amount of Co2P4O12 on the CFP was measured to be 13 mg cm−2. Finally, nanoparticles of titanium oxide (TiO2) were loaded onto the surface of Co2P4O12 particles by immersion coating. The procedures can be found in more detail in the Experimental section.

The XRD pattern of TiO2@Co2P4O12 is analogous to that of Co2P4O12 (Fig. 1b), both matching well with that of monoclinic phase Co2P4O12 (JCPDS no. 84-2208). The absence of the TiO2 peak in the XRD pattern of TiO2@Co2P4O12 can be ascribed to the low loading amount of TiO2 on the surface of Co2P4O12. The atomic ratio of Ti on the surface of TiO2@Co2P4O12 is 11.22% according to the survey spectrum of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (Fig. S2a in the ESI‡), and the presence of TiO2 is indicated by the distinct Ti 2p peak with a binding energy (BE) of 459.3 eV (Fig. S2b in the ESI‡). TiO2 has minor influence on the surface electronic structure of Co2P4O12. No obvious BE shift of Co can be found between the Co 2p window spectra of TiO2@Co2P4O12 and TiO2-free Co2P4O12 (Fig. S2c in the ESI‡).
The morphology of Co2P4O12 was monitored by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), which is shown in panel a to c of Fig. S3 in the ESI.‡ The CFP was fully covered by Co2P4O12 particles, which have a smooth surface. The size of these particles was estimated to be 1.1 ± 0.4 μm (Fig. S3d in the ESI‡). With the loading of TiO2, small particles can be found on the surface of Co2P4O12 particles, whereas no obvious size variation of Co2P4O12 particles can be found (panel c to e of Fig. 1). Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) carried out in SEM suggests that the atomic ratio of Ti to Co is 1:6.8. Therefore, the loading amount of TiO2 is ca. 0.7 mg cm−2, and its weight content in the composite is 5.1%. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) characterization shows that the Co2P4O12 particles were well crystallized (panel e to f of Fig. S3 in the ESI‡), while a layer of nearly amorphous structure can be found on the surface of Co2P4O12 particles in TiO2@Co2P4O12 (Fig. 1f and g). The high resolution TEM (HRTEM) image (Fig. 1g) shows distinct lattice fringes, which can be ascribed to (1 2 1) and (−1 −1 2) of Co2P4O12. The fast Fourier transform (FFT) of lattice fringes matches well with the [5 −3 1] zone axis of the diffraction pattern of Co2P4O12 (1/dOA = d(−1 −1 2) = 4.3 Å, 1/dOB = d(0 1 3) = 2.7 Å, 1/dOC = d(1 2 1) = 3.3 Å, ∠AOB = 55°, ∠BOC = 40°). To assess the crystallinity of TiO2, TiO2 was deposited on the surface of bare CFP. XRD shows that no distinct peak from TiO2 can be detected (Fig. S4a in the ESI‡), although a copious amount of TiO2 has been deposited on the CFP (panel b to d of Fig. S4 in ESI‡). The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of TiO2 is shown in Fig. S4e in the ESI.‡ No distinct diffraction rings can be found, suggesting that the TiO2 was amorphous. The amorphous nature of TiO2 can also be confirmed using the high magnification TEM image (Fig. S4f in the ESI‡), which shows no lattice fringes. XRD and TEM characterization show that no crystalline TiO2 was formed under the mild solution deposition conditions in our experiment. The scanning TEM (STEM) image and the corresponding EDS mapping images (Fig. S5 in the ESI‡) reveal the good distribution of Co, P, Ti, and O elements in TiO2@Co2P4O12, confirming the homogeneous distribution of TiO2 nanoparticles on the surface of Co2P4O12 particles.
The surface areas of Co2P4O12 and TiO2@Co2P4O12 were measured to be 23.91 and 16.03 m2 g−1, respectively, via Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) analysis (Fig. S6a and b in the ESI‡). The BJH (Barrett, Joyner, and Halenda) pore size distribution of samples was derived from N2 sorption isotherms. Co2P4O12 has pores with diameters around 2.3, 4.0, and 5.8 nm, and the pores with diameter between 4 and 6 nm were found in TiO2@Co2P4O12 besides those with 2.3 nm diameter (Fig. S6c and d in the ESI‡).
2.2 Electrocatalytic activity of TiO2@Co2P4O12 in the HER
TiO2@Co2P4O12 exhibits unexpected performance in catalyzing the HER. The electrocatalytic activity of TiO2@Co2P4O12 in the HER was evaluated by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) in basic solution (1 M KOH). A three-electrode setup was used in the measurements, and the counter electrode is a graphite rod. The scan rate is 5 mV s−1. Activation of TiO2@Co2P4O12 occurs during repeated LSV scans. The cathodic current of TiO2@Co2P4O12 increases gradually with increasing LSV steps, and finally a stable polarization curve was obtained after 30 scans (Fig. 2a). The overpotential required to drive a current density of 20 mA cm−2 (η20) was extracted from the polarization curves and plotted versus the number of LSV scans in Fig. 2b. The η20 decreases gradually with LSV scan number and then is stabilized, indicating clearly the activation process of TiO2@Co2P4O12. The electrochemically activated TiO2@Co2P4O12 is denoted as TiO2@Co2P4O12(A) in the following discussion. Co2P4O12 was also subjected to repeated LSV scans. It was shown that a stable polarization curve is obtained in 10 LSV scans, and the repeated LSV scans induce minor improvement of performance (Fig. S7 in the ESI‡). The Co2P4O12 subjected to electrochemical treatment (repeated LSV scans) is denoted as Co2P4O12(E).

(c) Polarization curves and (d) corresponding Tafel plots of TiO2@Co2P4O12(A), Co2P4O12(E), TiO2, Pt/C, and bare CFP. (e) A comparison of detected and theoretical volume of H2 produced during a potentiostatic electrolysis experiment. (f) j–t relationship of TiO2@Co2P4O12(A) in a potentiostatic electrolysis experiment (1 M KOH, η = 90 mV). The inset of Fig. 2f shows the polarization curves of TiO2@Co2P4O12(A) measured before and after j–t measurement. All potentials were corrected with the iR drop, and all measurements were carried out in basic solution (1 M KOH). 
The typical stable polarization curve of TiO2@Co2P4O12(A) is shown in Fig. 2c, and that of the bare CFP, commercial Pt/C catalyst (Johnson Matthey, Hispec 3000, 20 wt%), Co2P4O12(E), and TiO2 are shown for comparison. The Pt/C catalyst was loaded onto a glassy carbon electrode with a mass loading of 0.285 mg cm−2. The synthesis of TiO2 on the CFP can be found in the Experimental section and the corresponding characterization in Fig. S4 in the ESI.‡ The TiO2@Co2P4O12(A) shows prominent activity in the HER in alkaline media. The η20 is as small as 81 mV, and the overpotential required for a current density of 100 mA cm−2 (η100) is as small as 142 mV. The η100 of TiO2@Co2P4O12(A) is comparable to that of Pt/C, showing the promising application potential of TiO2@Co2P4O12(A) in large scale water electrolysis. The Co2P4O12(E) has an η20 of 238 mV and an η100 of 348 mV. The bare CFP and TiO2 show negligible reductive currents in the potential range of 0 to −350 mV versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). The performance of Co2P4O12 is remarkably enhanced by HER-inactive TiO2, as shown by prominent reduction of overpotential of the HER. The introduction of TiO2 induces the reduction of η20 as large as 157 mV, and the reduction of η100 as large as 206 mV. The TiO2@Co2P4O12(A) samples with different TiO2 loadings were also evaluated to confirm that the sample shown in Fig. 2c is the optimal one among all TiO2@Co2P4O12(A) samples (Fig. S8 in the ESI‡).
The polarization curves are shown as Tafel plots in Fig. 2d. The apparent Tafel slope can be obtained by fitting the linear part of the Tafel plot at large overpotential. The Tafel slope of TiO2@Co2P4O12(A) is 87 mV dec−1, which is smaller than that of Co2P4O12(E) (152 mV dec−1). The Tafel slope shows that the current density of TiO2@Co2P4O12(A) increases faster than that of Co2P4O12(E). The exchange current density (j0) of TiO2@Co2P4O12(A) is 2.307 mA cm−2, ca. four times larger than that of Co2P4O12(E) (0.537 mA cm−2). The turnover frequencies (TOFs) of samples are shown in Fig. S9 in the ESI.‡ To obtain a TOF of 1 s−1, TiO2@Co2P4O12(A) requires an overpotential of 52 mV, while Co2P4O12(E) requires 205 mV. The HER activity was largely improved in terms of Tafel slope, exchange current density, and TOF when TiO2 nanoparticles were introduced in the electrocatalyst.
Faradaic efficiency was estimated using the ratio between detected volume and theoretical volume of hydrogen gas produced in a potentiostatic electrolysis experiment. The faradaic efficiency of TiO2@Co2P4O12(A) is 96% (Fig. 2e), indicating that nearly all electrons delivered to the surface of TiO2@Co2P4O12(A) are utilized to reduce water into hydrogen. Meanwhile, TiO2@Co2P4O12(A) exhibits long-term stability for catalyzing the HER. The long-term stability was indicated by potentiostatic electrolysis carried out at η = 90 mV (Fig. 2f), which shows that the current density is almost unchanged for 40 h. The polarization curves of TiO2@Co2P4O12(A) measured before and after potentiostatic electrolysis are plotted in the inset of Fig. 2f, which shows that the η20 value increased from 81 to 82 mV, and the η100 value increased from 152 to 165 mV. The relatively small increase of the η20 and η100 values in the polarization curves and the relatively minor variation of current density in the potentiostatic electrolysis experiments indicate that TiO2@Co2P4O12(A) has excellent long-term stability of the catalytic activity. In addition, the morphology of TiO2@Co2P4O12(A) subjected to 40 h electrolysis was investigated (Fig. S10 in the ESI‡), which was analogous to that of TiO2@Co2P4O12. The leaching of Co and P was evaluated by measuring Co and P concentration in electrolyte. The TiO2@Co2P4O12(A) was subjected to a HER experiment in a fresh aqueous solution of KOH (125 mL) for 8 h, and the concentration of Co and P in the resultant electrolyte was detected by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The leaching amount of Co in the HER was 16 μg cm−2 and that of P was 640 μg cm−2. The much larger leaching amount of P suggests the surface reconstruction of Co2P4O12, which will be discussed in detail later.
The performances of representative highly efficient non-precious HER catalysts are listed in Table S1 in the ESI.‡ It is seen that the η20 and η100 values of the TiO2@Co2P4O12(A) in basic solution are favorably smaller than those of most reported non-precious HER electrocatalysts, indicating that TiO2@Co2P4O12(A) is one of the best non-noble metal HER catalysts in basic solution.
The catalytic activity of the TiO2@Co2P4O12(A) in acidic solution was also evaluated. Although the TiO2@Co2P4O12(A) exhibits catalytic activity in acidic solution, with an η20 of 198 mV and an η100 of 335 mV (Fig. S11a in the ESI‡), and a Tafel slope of 113 mV dec−1 (Fig. S11b in the ESI‡), the performance declined in the potentiostatic electrolysis experiment (Fig. S11c in the ESI‡), indicating the instability of the TiO2@Co2P4O12(A) in acidic media. The instability of the TiO2@Co2P4O12(A) should be associated with the slow dissolution of Co2P4O12 in acidic media, which gradually decreases the effective loading amount of the catalyst on the CFP. The faradaic efficiency of the TiO2@Co2P4O12(A) is 94% in acidic electrolyte (Fig. S11d in the ESI‡).
2.3 Activation mechanism of TiO2@Co2P4O12 during the HER
In the initial stage of repeated LSV scans, the performance of TiO2@Co2P4O12 gradually enhanced and then stabilized in 30 scans, indicating that TiO2@Co2P4O12 was electrochemically activated. The activation of TiO2@Co2P4O12 can be attributed to the reduction of Co2P4O12 to Co nanoparticles at the interface of TiO2 and Co2P4O12, resulting in a TiO2@Co@Co2P4O12 composite. It will be shown that the surface reconstruction of Co2P4O12 is promoted markedly by TiO2 particles.
XRD experiments were carried out to detect the possible structure evolution of TiO2@Co2P4O12 after the electrochemical activation. The XRD pattern of the TiO2@Co2P4O12(A) resembles that of TiO2@Co2P4O12 (Fig. S12 in the ESI‡), indicating that the bulk composition of the electrocatalyst remains as Co2P4O12. The TEM and SEM characterization (Fig. S13 in the ESI‡) show that TiO2@Co2P4O12(A) has a similar morphology to TiO2@Co2P4O12. No obvious morphology variation occurs after the electrochemical activation of TiO2@Co2P4O12.
The evolution of the chemical structure of the surface of TiO2@Co2P4O12 was indicated by XPS measurements. XPS survey spectra of TiO2@Co2P4O12 and TiO2@Co2P4O12(A) (Fig. S14a in the ESI‡) both show distinct peaks of Co, O, C, and Ti, while TiO2@Co2P4O12(A) shows a weaker peak of P in comparison with TiO2@Co2P4O12. The weakening of the P peak in TiO2@Co2P4O12(A) can be confirmed from the P 2p window of the XPS spectrum (Fig. S14b in the ESI‡). Quantitative analysis shows that the atomic ratio of P to Co in TiO2@Co2P4O12(A) is 1.16, which is smaller than that in TiO2@Co2P4O12 (4.23). This indicates that the activation reduces the content of P in TiO2@Co2P4O12(A). In addition, the XPS survey spectrum of TiO2@Co2P4O12 subjected to j–t measurement, denoted as TiO2@Co2P4O12 (jt), is shown in Fig. S15 in the ESI,‡ demonstrating the presence of Co, O, C, Ti and a little amount of P in TiO2@Co2P4O12. The atomic ratio of P to Co determined by quantitative analysis of TiO2@Co2P4O12 (jt) is 0.27, further confirming that the activation reduces the content of P in TiO2@Co2P4O12 (jt).
Prominent variation of the electronic structure of Co atoms was revealed by the Co 2p window of the XPS spectrum. TiO2@Co2P4O12 shows two Co 2p3/2 peaks at 782.2 and 785.4 eV (Fig. 3a). The peak at 782.2 eV corresponds to Co in Co2P4O12,14 and that at 785.4 eV is the satellite peak associated with Co2+ sites.18 After the activation, these two peaks shift to 780.8 eV and 788.0 eV, respectively. The peak at 780.8 eV is located between that of CoO (780.1 eV)19 and Co(OH)2 (781.0 eV),19 and here it is assigned to Co in CoOx(OH)y with the valence of the Co atom being 2+. The activation induces a distinct shift of Co 2p peaks, indicating the formation of CoOx(OH)y on the surface of TiO2@Co2P4O12(A). Meanwhile, Co peaks corresponding to Co2P4O12 are hardly found in TiO2@Co2P4O12(A), suggesting that the surface of Co2P4O12 particles is nearly fully covered by CoOx(OH)y.

The compositional variation of Co2P4O12 to CoOx(OH)y in TiO2@Co2P4O12(A) can also be confirmed using the O 1s and P 2p XPS spectra. TiO2@Co2P4O12(A) shows a peak of P in phosphate (133.8 eV)14 much weaker than that of TiO2@Co2P4O12 (Fig. S14b in the ESI‡), suggesting the reduction of P content on the surface of TiO2@Co2P4O12. The O 1s window of the XPS spectrum (Fig. 3b) of TiO2@Co2P4O12(A) shows three peaks, which can be assigned to O in absorbed H2O (533.2 eV),20 TiO2 (531.0 eV),21 and CoOx(OH)y (529.6 eV).19 In contrast, the O 1s XPS spectrum of TiO2@Co2P4O12 shows the peaks of H2O (533.3 eV), TiO2 (531.0 eV), and Co2P4O12 (531.8 eV).14 The absence of O corresponding to the phosphate in TiO2@Co2P4O12(A) is in good accordance with the reduction of phosphate content on the surface of TiO2@Co2P4O12(A), and the presence of new Co–O bonds on the surface of TiO2@Co2P4O12(A) confirms unambiguously the formation of CoOx(OH)y. The activation results in partial reduction of Ti, because the BE of Ti in TiO2 negatively shifts from 459.3 eV in TiO2@Co2P4O12 to 458.6 eV in TiO2@Co2P4O12(A) (Fig. S14c in the ESI‡). The binding energy (458.6 eV) lies between the typical value of TiO2 (∼459.6 eV)22 and TiO (∼454.6 eV).23 It is therefore reasonable to estimate that the valence of Ti is ca. 3+. That is, O vacancies exist in TiO2@Co2P4O12(A) after HER measurement.
The XPS spectra suggest that the surface of TiO2@Co2P4O12(A) was covered by a layer of CoOx(OH)y. However, it should be noted that the XPS experiments were carried out ex situ and do not reflect the chemical state of samples during the HER. It is well known that the chemical state of cobalt oxide correlates highly to electrochemical potential, which has been summarized as the Pourbaix diagram of cobalt (see also Fig. S16 in the ESI‡).24 The Pourbaix diagram of cobalt indicates that the stable phase of cobalt is metallic cobalt when the applied potential is more negative than 0 versus RHE. That is, metallic Co nanoparticles but not CoOx(OH)y nanoparticles should be present on the surface of TiO2@Co2P4O12(A) during the HER. Our assumption is also in accordance with in situ XPS measurement of cobalt foil under different applied potentials, which shows clearly that cobalt oxide can be reduced to metallic cobalt under a similar potential.25 The formation of metallic Co nanoparticles was also suggested by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and in situ Raman spectroscopy in our experiments.
The CV experiment of partially activated TiO2@Co2P4O12 and TiO2@Co2P4O12(A) explicitly shows the redox process of CoOx(OH)y (Fig. 3c). In the CV curve of partially activated TiO2@Co2P4O12 a distinct oxidative peak can be found at 0.3 V versus RHE and a small reductive peak is located near 0 versus RHE. The corresponding redox reaction is Co + 2OH− ⇆ Co(OH)2 + 2e− according to the Pourbaix diagram of cobalt, confirming that CoOx(OH)y should be reduced to metallic cobalt during the HER. In the CV curve of TiO2@Co2P4O12(A) the oxidative peak remains apparent, while the reductive peak is negligible because the current corresponding to the reductive reaction Co(OH)2 + 2e− → Co + 2OH− is much smaller than that corresponding to the HER.
Raman spectroscopy was employed to analyze the compositional variation of TiO2@Co2P4O12 in the HER process (Fig. 3d), in order to confirm the conversion of CoOx(OH)y to Co during the HER. Two intense peaks can be found in the spectrum of TiO2@Co2P4O12, which can be assigned to P–Ob (bridged, 680 cm−1) and P–Ot (terminal, 1150 cm−1) symmetric stretching modes, respectively.26,27 The TiO2 deposited on the bare CFP shows several broad bands around 186, 429, 613, and 910 cm−1. These bands can be assigned to amorphous TiO2.28 Because the weight content of amorphous TiO2 in the composite is smaller (5.1%), these broad bands are hardly identified in the Raman spectrum of TiO2@Co2P4O12. The sample was subjected to electrochemical activation and an in situ Raman experiment was carried out. When TiO2@Co2P4O12(A) was applied with a potential of −0.1 V versus RHE, no peak can be found in the Raman spectrum. After the sample was set at the open circuit potential and kept in electrolyte for several minutes, a small peak corresponding to OH deformation modes (1061 cm−1)29 can be found in the Raman spectrum, indicating the formation of Co(OH)2. The experiment shows that during the HER the peaks of oxides, hydroxides, or phosphates could not be found on the surface of TiO2@Co2P4O12(A), and the CoOx(OH)y suggested by XPS comes from the slow oxidation of metallic cobalt in electrolyte and/or air.
The surface reconstruction of Co2P4O12 is markedly promoted by TiO2. The XPS spectrum of Co2P4O12(E) was monitored to access its surface electronic structure. Different from the case of TiO2@Co2P4O12(A), the XPS spectrum of Co2P4O12(E) matches well with that of Co2P4O12 (Fig. S17 in the ESI‡). No peaks corresponding to CoOx(OH)y can be found, emphasizing the stability of the surface chemical composition of Co2P4O12 during repeated LSV scans. The surface reconstruction of pure Co2P4O12 can only occur after long-term j–t measurement. The Co2P4O12 subjected to 5 h j–t measurement is denoted as Co2P4O12 (jt). The Co 2p window of the XPS spectrum of Co2P4O12 (jt) (Fig. S18a in the ESI‡) shows a peak of CoOx(OH)y at 780.7 eV, while the peak corresponding to Co2P4O12 remains distinct at 782.0 eV. The presence of the peak corresponding to Co2P4O12 emphasizes that the surface reconstruction of Co2P4O12 (jt) is less prominent than that of TiO2@Co2P4O12(A). The weaker surface reconstruction of Co2P4O12 (jt) is further confirmed by its O 1s window of the XPS spectrum (Fig. S18b in the ESI‡), which shows that the peak of O in Co2P4O12 (531.7 eV) is much stronger than that in CoOx(OH)y (529.8 eV).
The TiO2-promoted surface reconstruction of Co2P4O12 can be ascribed to the weakening of P–O bonds by TiO2. The P–Ob (bridged) and P–Ob (terminal) windows of Raman spectra of Co2P4O12 and TiO2@Co2P4O12 show that the peaks of TiO2@Co2P4O12 are red shifted in comparison with those of Co2P4O12 (Fig. S19 in the ESI‡), indicating the decrease of the bond strength of P–Ob (bridged) and P–Ob (terminal).27 Meanwhile, a comparison of XPS spectra shows that the BE of P atoms in TiO2@Co2P4O12 is 0.6 V negatively shifted in comparison with that in Co2P4O12 (Fig. S2d in the ESI‡), implying the weakening of P–O bonds in PO43− as well.30 The weakening of P–O bonds in PO43− facilitates the breaking of P–O bonds and reduction of Co(2+) to metallic Co during the activation process of TiO2@Co2P4O12.
2.4 Origin of electrocatalytic activity of TiO2@Co2P4O12(A) during the HER
The electrocatalytic performance of TiO2@Co2P4O12(A) can be attributed to the synergetic effect between Co2P4O12, Co (metallic), and TiO2. The contribution of each component in TiO2@Co2P4O12(A) was evaluated by a series of control experiments.
TiO2@Co was synthesized and evaluated to confirm the contribution of Co2P4O12 during water reduction, where TiO2@Co is TiO2 nanoparticles loaded on the surface of CFP-supported Co particles. The synthesis and characterization of TiO2@Co can be found in the Experimental section and Fig. S20 in the ESI.‡Fig. 4a shows that the reductive current density of TiO2@Co is smaller than that of TiO2@Co2P4O12(A) under the same applied potentials. The η20 of TiO2@Co (136 mV) is larger than that of TiO2@Co2P4O12(A) (81 mV), and the η100 of TiO2@Co (219 mV) is larger than that of TiO2@Co2P4O12(A) (142 mV). The superior performance of TiO2@Co2P4O12(A) in comparison with that of TiO2@Co indicates that Co2P4O12 contributes positively during the HER, and is necessary to promote the performance of TiO2@Co. On the other hand, Co2P4O12 (jt) was adopted as a comparative sample that represents metallic cobalt loaded on Co2P4O12 (Co@Co2P4O12), because we have shown above that CoOx(OH)y exists on the surface of Co2P4O12 (jt) after air exposure (Fig. S18 in the ESI‡), and that CoOx(OH)y should be converted to metallic cobalt during the HER as that occurs on the surface of TiO2@Co2P4O12(A). The performance of Co@Co2P4O12 is far inferior to that of TiO2@Co2P4O12(A), with an η20 of 202 mV and an η100 of 273 mV for Co@Co2P4O12. This therefore emphasizes the positive contribution of TiO2 during the HER occurring on the surface of TiO2@Co2P4O12(A). The polarization curves of Co2P4O12(E) and Co are also presented in Fig. 4a, indicating that TiO2@Co2P4O12(A) is the most active one among all comparative samples.

All potentials were corrected with the iR drop. In panel (c) the scatters are experimental data, and lines are fitting curves using the dual-pathway kinetic model. 
In principle, the performance of an electrocatalyst is correlated to its intrinsic catalytic activity, surface area, and conductivity. To understand the origin of the outstanding performance of TiO2@Co2P4O12(A), key electrochemical parameters of TiO2@Co2P4O12(A) and comparative samples were determined, including charge transport resistance (Rct), double layer capacitance (Cdl), and resistance of electron transport (Ret). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of the comparative samples was carried out to gain insight into their reaction kinetics during the HER. The results are shown in Nyquist plots in Fig. S21a in the ESI,‡ in which the spectra are fitted using an equivalent circuit shown in Fig. S21b in the ESI.‡ The values corresponding to elements in the equivalent circuit are shown in Fig. 4b and Table S2 in the ESI.‡ The Rct at the electrocatalyst/electrolyte interface is usually adopted as an indicator of the kinetics of the catalyst, which can be estimated from the diameter of the semicircle in the low frequency range. A smaller Rct corresponds to faster HER kinetics. The Rct of TiO2@Co2P4O12(A) (11.1 Ω) is smaller than that of Co@Co2P4O12 (134.1 Ω) and TiO2@Co (19.1 Ω), demonstrating faster reaction kinetics of TiO2@Co2P4O12(A) in the HER.
Usually the electrochemical surface area (ECSA) is estimated by CV scans carried out in the non-faradaic potential region. However, it has been shown above that the surface cobalt species undergo redox reactions in the potential range of 0 to 0.2 V versus RHE (Fig. 3c), and at potentials larger than 0.2 V versus RHE the surface is CoOx(OH)y, which is different from metallic cobalt that exists in the real HER. Therefore, the ECSA should not be estimated using Cdl derived from CV scans. To exclude any possible error induced by redox reactions on the surface of samples and reflect an ECSA corresponding to a real catalytic surface, the ECSA is estimated from Cdl extracted from EIS spectra (measurement potential: −100 mV versus RHE). It has been showed that the surface areas estimated from EIS measurements were comparable to those from underpotential deposition (UPD), surface oxidation/reduction reaction, and BET measurement.31,32 Therefore, EIS is a reasonable approach to estimate the ECSA of samples, with validity similar to that of UDP or CV. The Cdl is 40.1 mF cm−2 for TiO2@Co2P4O12(A), 42.5 mF cm−2 for Co@Co2P4O12 and 55.1 mF cm−2 for TiO2@Co. Given that the typical value of capacitance is 20–60 μF cm−2,1 a capacitance of 40 μF cm−2 is used to estimate the ECSA of samples. The ECSA is 1003 cm2 for TiO2@Co2P4O12(A), 1063 cm2 for Co@Co2P4O12, and 1378 cm2 for TiO2@Co. It is shown that the ECSA of TiO2@Co2P4O12(A) is smaller than that of Co@Co2P4O12. The smaller ECSA of TiO2@Co2P4O12(A) might be associated with the loading of TiO2 particles which block small pores (e.g. interstices between Co2P4O12 particles). The Ret is estimated from the sum of R1 and Rs in the equivalent circuit. The Ret value of TiO2@Co2P4O12(A) (4.3 Ω) is analogous to that of Co@Co2P4O12 (5.1 Ω). Therefore, the introduction of TiO2 on the surface of Co2P4O12 does not hinder effective electron transport from the current collector (CFP) to the sample surface.
The intrinsic performances of the samples were evaluated from the current densities computed by normalizing polarization currents with ECSA (JECSA). The results are presented as scatter dots in Fig. 4c, which shows clearly that TiO2@Co2P4O12(A) affords a JECSA value larger than that of Co@Co2P4O12 and TiO2@Co. At an overpotential of 140 mV, the JECSA is 0.046 mA cm−2 for TiO2@Co2P4O12(A), 0.002 mA cm−2 for Co@Co2P4O12, and 0.008 mA cm−2 for TiO2@Co. The JECSA and TOF (Fig. S9 in the ESI‡) data indicate that the intrinsic catalytic activity of TiO2@Co2P4O12(A) is superior to that of Co@Co2P4O12 and TiO2@Co.
In general, three steps can occur in the HER, including the Volmer step (H2O + e− → H* + OH−), Heryrovsky step (H2O + H* + e− → H2 + OH−), and Tafel step (2H* → H2), where H* is the hydrogen adatom intermediate. The HER can proceed in the Volmer–Heyrovsky pathway or Volmer–Tafel pathway, depending on the free energy barrier of different steps. To gain insight into the HER mechanism and the influence of each component in TiO2@Co2P4O12(A) on its performance, the standard activation free energy for the three elementary steps ( for the Volmer step,  for the Heyrovsky step, and  for the Tafel step) and the standard free energy of adsorption for the reaction intermediate  are fitted from JECSA using the dual-pathway kinetic model.33,34 The lines in Fig. 4c show the best fits of JECSA using the dual-pathway kinetic model. The Volmer–Heyrovsky pathway was found to dominate the HER for TiO2@Co2P4O12(A), Co@Co2P4O12, and TiO2@Co, because the standard activation free energy of the Tafel step was much larger than that of the Heyrovsky step (see details in Table S3 in the ESI‡).
The free energy diagram was constructed using the resultant free energy. Fig. 4d shows the resultant free energy diagram. The activation energy of the Volmer step (water dissociation) is  and that of the Heyrovsky step (electrochemical recombination) is  The Co2P4O12(E) has a  of 359 meV. In contrast, the  is 241 meV and the  is 403 meV for Co. This suggests that water dissociation occurs faster on the surface of Co in comparison with Co2P4O12(E). For Co@Co2P4O12, the  is 200 meV, and the  is 396 meV. The  of Co@Co2P4O12 is smaller than that of Co and Co2P4O12(E), suggesting that a synergistic effect between Co and Co2P4O12 promotes the surface Volmer step. The  of Co@Co2P4O12 is nearly the same as that of Co, implying that electrochemical recombination occurs mainly on the surface of Co particles. On the other hand, the loading of TiO2 can reduce the  to 165 meV in TiO2@Co, and the  is reduced to 372 meV, suggesting that TiO2 can reduce both the energy barrier of water dissociation and electrochemical recombination, in comparison with Co. The function of TiO2 can be ascribed to the enhancement of water adsorption on the surface of TiO2 and the modulation of the  of Co by TiO2.6 For TiO2@Co2P4O12(A), the  is 97 meV and  is 321 meV. Both values are the smallest among all comparative samples. Therefore, it is reasonable to postulate that in TiO2@Co2P4O12(A), Co2P4O12 can promote water dissociation, TiO2 can accelerate both water dissociation and electrochemical recombination, and the electrochemical recombination occurs mainly on the surface of metallic Co.
2.5 Electrocatalytic activity of TiO2@Co2P4O12 in the OER and full water splitting
TiO2@Co2P4O12(A) also exhibits enhanced activity in the OER in comparison with Co2P4O12(E). The evaluations were carried out under alkaline conditions (KOH, 1 M), and the corresponding polarization curves are shown in Fig. 5a. The oxidative current of TiO2@Co2P4O12(A) is larger than that of Co2P4O12 (jt) and Co2P4O12(E). The η20 of TiO2@Co2P4O12(A) (330 mV) is smaller than that of Co2P4O12(E) (417 mV) and Co2P4O12 (jt) (396 mV). Meanwhile, the η100 of TiO2@Co2P4O12(A) (361 mV) is smaller than that of Co2P4O12(E) (503 mV) and Co2P4O12 (jt) (467 mV). Under open circuit conditions, Co2P4O12 (jt) is Co2P4O12 loaded with CoOx(OH)y, and TiO2@Co2P4O12(A) is Co2P4O12 loaded with CoOx(OH)y and TiO2. Co2P4O12 (jt) would present a similar surface composition to TiO2@Co2P4O12(A) except that no TiO2 exists on the surface of Co2P4O12 (jt). Therefore, the superior performance of TiO2@Co2P4O12(A) in comparison with that of Co2P4O12(E) and Co2P4O12 (jt) indicates the positive contribution of TiO2 during water oxidation catalyzed by TiO2@Co2P4O12(A). The Tafel slope of TiO2@Co2P4O12(A) (44.0 mV dec−1) is also smaller than that of Co2P4O12(E) (113.7 mV dec−1) and Co2P4O12 (jt) (95.3 mV dec−1), implying a faster OER rate for TiO2@Co2P4O12(A) (Fig. 5b). The TOFs of samples are plotted versus potential in Fig. S22 in the ESI,‡ showing that TiO2@Co2P4O12(A) exhibits the largest TOF among all comparative samples. TiO2@Co2P4O12(A) also affords long-term catalysis of the OER. A potentiostatic electrolysis experiment shows that the current density is maintained at 96% of the initial value after 40 h testing (Fig. 5c). The polarization curves of TiO2@Co2P4O12(A) before and after potentiostatic electrolysis experiments (inset in Fig. 5c) show a little increase of overpotential (2 mV at 20 mA cm−2 and 17 mV at 100 mA cm−2). These results indicate that TiO2@Co2P4O12(A) has superior stability in the long-term electrochemical process. The faradaic yield is 95% in 1 M KOH (Fig. 5d). The prominent performance of TiO2@Co2P4O12(A) ranks it among the most active OER electrocatalysts reported, the details of comparison are listed in Table S4 in the ESI.‡

(c) J–t relation of TiO2@Co2P4O12(A) in a potentiostatic OER (1 M KOH, η = 350 mV).

(d) A comparison of detected and theoretical volume of O2 produced during the potentiostatic electrolysis experiment. (e) Rct, Ret, and Cdl derived from EIS spectra. (f) Polarization curves normalized by ECSA. All potentials were corrected with the iR drop. 
EIS spectra were measured and shown in Nyquist plots in Fig. S23 in the ESI.‡ The values of Rct, Ret, and Cdl were derived from EIS spectra and shown in Fig. 5e and Table S5 in the ESI.‡ The Rct of TiO2@Co2P4O12(A) (8.7 Ω) is smaller than that of Co2P4O12(E) (27.1 Ω) and Co2P4O12 (jt) (13.0 Ω), demonstrating more favorable electrocatalytic kinetics of TiO2@Co2P4O12(A) for the OER. The Cdl is 216.1 mF cm−2 for TiO2@Co2P4O12(A), which is only a little smaller than that for Co2P4O12(E) (253.6 mF cm−2) and Co2P4O12 (jt) (233.2 mF cm−2). The intrinsic performances of the samples were evaluated from JECSA (Fig. 5f). The current density is 4.06 μA cm−2 for TiO2@Co2P4O12(A) at an overpotential of 140 mV, which is larger than that for Co2P4O12(E) (0.24 μA cm−2) and Co2P4O12 (jt) (0.40 μA cm−2). The JECSA data show that the intrinsic catalytic activity of TiO2@Co2P4O12(A) is superior to that of Co2P4O12(E) and Co2P4O12 (jt).
The catalytic activity of TiO2@Co2P4O12(A) in the HER and OER is unrelated to its catalytic history. That is, it can catalyze efficiently the HER after being used as an OER electrocatalyst, and vice versa. Fig. 6a shows the overpotential of TiO2@Co2P4O12(A) in a sequence of measurements in which TiO2@Co2P4O12(A) was used alternately as the HER and OER electrocatalyst. The η20 values for the HER are nearly unchanged in different HER measurements, and those for the OER are also stable. This feature is different from that of metal phosphides or sulfides, which endure surface oxidation to phosphates or oxides during the OER process and then lose their HER activity. The arbitrary switch between being a HER electrocatalyst and OER electrocatalyst is beneficial for real nonpolar water electrolysis.

(c) Chronoamperometric curve of water electrolysis for TiO2@Co2P4O12 in a two-electrode configuration at 1.68 V versus RHE. The inset of (c) shows the polarization curves of TiO2@Co2P4O12 before and after potentiostatic electrolysis experiments. 
A water splitting cell using TiO2@Co2P4O12(A) as both the anode and cathode was constructed. The polarization curve of the cell is shown in Fig. 6b. The catalytic current increases gradually with cell voltage, and the η20 is 434 mV. The catalytic activity of TiO2@Co2P4O12(A) is comparable to that of typical overall water splitting catalysts (Table S6 in the ESI‡). The long-term stability of this system was also demonstrated by chronoamperometry experiments for 40 h in 1.0 M KOH solution. TiO2@Co2P4O12(A) maintains a stable current density of ∼20 mA cm−2 for 40 h (Fig. 6c). The polarization curves measured before and after the potentiostatic electrolysis show a little decrease of current density, further indicating the stability of the sample in the long-term electrochemical process (inset of Fig. 6c).
2.6 Origin of electrocatalytic activity of TiO2@Co2P4O12(A) during the OER
It was shown in Fig. 5f that the intrinsic activity of TiO2@Co2P4O12(A) is more than that of Co2P4O12(E) and Co2P4O12 (jt). The apparent activation energy (Ea) was estimated to understand the kinetics barriers involved in the OER on the surface of different samples. The temperature related polarization curves of samples were measured (panel a, b, and c of Fig. S24 in the ESI‡), and the corresponding Arrhenius plots at an overpotential of 150 mV are shown in panel d, e, and f of Fig. S24 in the ESI.‡ The resultant values of Ea are summarized in Fig. 7a, the Ea of TiO2@Co2P4O12(A) is 53.00 kJ mol−1, which is smaller than that of Co2P4O12(E) (116.7 kJ mol−1) and Co2P4O12 (jt) (93.52 kJ mol−1).

To understand the role of TiO2 in the OER, the chemical state of the sample subjected to OER measurement was measured by XPS. The Ti 2p window of the XPS spectrum of TiO2@Co2P4O12 (jt-OER) was measured. TiO2@Co2P4O12 (jt-OER) was referenced to a sample which was subjected to long-term jt measurement under HER potential and was then measured under OER potential. The TiO2@Co2P4O12 (jt-OER) shows a binding energy of 458.0 eV (Fig. 7b), a value similar to that of a sample subjected to long-term HER measurement (457.9 eV) shown in Fig. S15e in the ESI.‡ That is, O vacancies exist in the TiO2 component of activated TiO2@Co2P4O12 during both HER and OER processes. The stability of O vacancies under HER and OER potentials is in accordance with the fact that O-vacancy-containing TiO2 can be used to oxidize water by solar irradiation.35
The smaller apparent activation energy of TiO2@Co2P4O12(A) in comparison with Co2P4O12(E) and Co2P4O12 (jt) might be ascribed to O vacancies in TiO2. The promoted adsorption of OH− and desorption of O2 is necessary for an efficient OER. The dissociative adsorption of water on O vacancy sites on the surface of TiO2 produces abundant adsorbed hydroxyl groups,36,37 which would contribute positively to the OER process. On the other hand, an O2-temperature programmed desorption (TPD) experiment was carried out to compare the O2 desorption capability of TiO2@Co2P4O12 and Co2P4O12. The results are plotted in Fig. 7c. It was shown that under low temperature O2 is easier to desorb from the surface of TiO2@Co2P4O12 in comparison with samples without TiO2. Therefore, the presence of TiO2 can promote both adsorption of OH− and desorption of O2, and therefore promote the OER process on the surface of TiO2@Co2P4O12. Meanwhile, TiO2 promotes both the HER and OER, making TiO2@Co2P4O12 a reversible bifunctional electrocatalyst for water splitting.
3. Conclusion
We synthesized TiO2@Co2P4O12 which acted as an efficient alkaline electrocatalyst for both the HER and OER. The η20 is as small as 81 mV for the HER and 330 mV for the OER. The TiO2 loading weakens P–O bonds in Co2P4O12, promoting the reduction of surface Co2P4O12 to Co during the HER. The synergistic effect between TiO2, Co2P4O12 and Co is responsible for the enhanced HER activity, with Co2P4O12 promoting the water dissociation and TiO2 facilitating both water dissociation and reduction. The work reports a novel and efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst for water splitting in alkaline media, and also a new strategy for the modification of the electrocatalyst's surface.
4. Experimental section
4.1 Materials
Cobaltous chloride hexahydrate (CoCl2·6H2O, AR), polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP, K30, GR), sodium hypophosphite (NaH2PO2, AR), ethanol (AR), acetone (AR), and tetrabutyl titanate (CP) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. (Shanghai, China). All chemical reagents were used without further purification.
4.2 Synthesis of Co2P4O12
In a typical experiment, CoCl2·6H2O (4 g), PVP (0.5 g), and absolute ethanol (5 mL) were thoroughly mixed by ultrasonication to form a homogeneous ink. A piece of clean CFP (1 × 4 cm2, TORAY, TGP-H-060) was dipped into the ink for ten seconds. Then the CFP was withdrawn from the ink and dried at 80 °C for 10 min. The resulting product was calcined at 600 °C for 120 min in flowing N2 (200 sccm), then phosphatized at 500 °C for 60 min with NaH2PO2 (4 g) at the upstream side of the furnace in N2 (60 sccm).
4.3 Synthesis of TiO2@Co2P4O12
To fabricate TiO2@Co2P4O12, Co2P4O12 was immersed in absolute ethanol (50 mL) containing tetrabutyl titanate (2.8 mM), which was vigorously stirred for 30 min. Then the fabricated TiO2@Co2P4O12 was washed with ethanol and dried at 60 °C in a vacuum.
4.4 Synthesis of TiO2@Co
CoCl2·6H2O (4 g), PVP (0.5 g), and absolute ethanol (5 mL) were thoroughly mixed by ultrasonication to form a homogeneous ink. A piece of clean CFP was dipped into the ink for ten seconds. Then the CFP was withdrawn from the ink and dried at 80 °C for 10 min. The product was calcined at 600 °C for 120 min in flowing 10% H2/90% N2 (200 sccm). Then the resulting product was immersed in absolute ethanol (50 mL) containing tetrabutyl titanate (2.8 mM), which was vigorously stirred for 30 min. The fabricated TiO2@Co was washed with absolute ethanol and dried at 60 °C in a vacuum.
4.5 Synthesis of TiO2 loaded on CFP
A piece of clean CFP was immersed in absolute ethanol (50 mL) containing tetrabutyl titanate (2.8 mM), which was vigorously stirred for 30 min. The fabricated TiO2 was washed with absolute ethanol and dried at 60 °C in a vacuum.
4.6 Characterization
The morphology of the samples was characterized with field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, S-4800, Hitachi) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Tecnai G2 F30 S-TWIN, FEI). Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å). Raman analysis was carried out on a DXR Raman spectrometer (Renisaw, UK) using laser excitation at 514 nm. The surface electronic structures of samples were investigated using an ESCALAB250Xi X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS).
4.7 Electrochemical performance
All electrochemical measurements were conducted using an electrochemical workstation (CHI 614D, CH Instruments) with a graphite rod as the counter electrode, and the sample of interest as the working electrode. A mercury/mercury oxide electrode (MOE) was used as the reference electrode in 1 M KOH, and a mercury/mercurous sulfate electrode (MSE) was used in 0.5 M H2SO4. HER tests were conducted in 1 M KOH or 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte at room temperature.
All of the potentials have been referenced to a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). The RHE potential was determined using the open circuit potential of a clean Pt electrode in the solution of interest bubbled with H2 (99.999%) and the potential was −0.941 V versus MOE in 1 M KOH solution, and −0.707 V versus MSE for the 0.5 M H2SO4 solution. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was carried out with a scan rate of 5 mV s−1, and the corresponding potential was corrected with iR-losses. The uncompensated cell resistance (R) was determined via the current-interrupt method, and iR correction was performed with ηcorr = η − iR. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed at η = 100 mV for the HER and η = 350 mV for the OER over the frequency range of 106 to 10−2 Hz and an amplitude of 10 mV. The volume of generated hydrogen during the evaluation of faradaic efficiency was determined by a water displacement method introduced in our previous publications.38–40
The turnover frequency (TOF) values of samples are computed according to the equation TOF = (J × A)/(2 × F × n) for the HER and the equation TOF = (J × A)/(4 × F × n) for the OER, where J is the current density at a given potential, A is the electrode area, the number 2 represents 2 electrons per mol of H2, the number 4 represents 4 electrons per mol of O2, and F is the Faraday constant (96485.3 C mol−1). The n should stand for the number of active sites in the sample, whereas the moles of Co atoms in the sample is adopted as n, as we currently have no direct measure of active site density. This calculation assumes that all Co atoms in the film are catalytically active. Actually the vast majority of the cobalt atoms are inaccessible to electrolyte, this is a gross underestimate of the real TOF of active sites, and the resultant TOF values are therefore the lower limit. Similar approaches to calculate TOF values have been previously reported.41,42
