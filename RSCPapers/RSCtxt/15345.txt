    , Accepted 19th January 2016First published on 19th January 2016AbstractIn this paper, we firstly report the preparation of 3D graphene networks (GNs) by sonication-free liquid-phase exfoliation (LPE) and C dot grafted graphene (CD–G) hybrids. The 3D GNs and CD–G hybrids were incorporated into TiO2 photoanodes for improving the photovoltaic performance of CdS/CdSe quantum dot sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs) due to their unique structures and excellent conductivities. When the amounts of incorporation are 1.6 wt% for GNs and 2.0 wt% for CD–G, η (photoelectric conversion efficiency) exhibited improvements from 4.04% to 4.37% and 4.69%, respectively. The remarkable improvements in η are predominantly ascribed to the fact that the electron transport from TiO2 to graphene decreased the probability of recombination of charge carriers and ultimately improved the photoelectric conversion efficiency. For CD–G/TiO2, the electron transport from C dots to graphene may strengthen the effect. This work demonstrates a possibility of fabricating superior photoanodes for enhancing the performances of QDSSCs by designing graphene nanoarchitectures with unique structures and morphologies as the dopants.
Introduction
Graphene, a two-dimensional carbon allotrope with a honeycomb structure, has attracted enormous attention because of its outstanding physical and chemical properties,1 which are important for various applications, including electronic devices,2 photonic devices,3,4 energy conversion and storage,5,6 polymer composites,7,8 catalysis9 and contamination purification.10 Until now, many studies have focused on graphene sheets. Clearly, graphene with other morphologies is of significant importance in the areas of supercapacitors, catalysts and drug delivery.11–13 Among these graphene materials with different morphologies, 3D GNs have attracted much attention because of their unique electronic band structure and high specific surface area,14,15 leading to their applications in some areas such as catalysis, sensing and electrochemical energy storage.16–18 Several techniques have been applied to fabricate 3D GNs, such as chemical vapor deposition (CVD),19 graphene oxide (GO) based composites,20 self-assembly,21 electrochemistry22 and lithographic patterning.23 Among these techniques, CVD and reduction of GO-based composites are believed to be the most effective methods for the fabrication of high-quality 3D GNs. However, the CVD process is an energy intensive process that might be too expensive for many applications. Reduction of GO-based composites requires constructing a GO-based composite and then reducing GO to produce 3D GNs, so the process can be complex and time-consuming. Therefore, it is of continuous interest to develop simple, practical, and effective methods to fabricate 3D GNs to take full advantages of graphene's intrinsic properties. LPE of graphite has been explored for preparing high-quality graphene sheets. Recently, we report on the successful preparation of high-quality graphene sheets with large-size in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) solvent by sonication-free LPE.24 Up to now, no reports show that 3D GNs were prepared by the LPE method.
Moreover, many potential applications and unique properties of graphene can be realized by integrating them into more complex assemblies. The CD–G hybrid is the nancomposite formed by covalent or non-covalent bonding between C dots and graphene sheets. Compared to 3D GNs, only a few reports are available in literature reports. In a previous work,25 carbon dots and graphene oxide sheets are combined via non-covalent interaction to form biocompatible and fluorescent hybrid materials. Qiu et al.26 reported that a carbon hybrid, the composite of N-doped carbon dots decorated onto graphene, was prepared by hydrothermal treatment. In another report,27 CDs/r-GO was obtained with the assistance of sodium borohydride in liquid phase. Until now, no reports show that CD–G was prepared by forming covalent bonds between C dots and graphene sheets.
QDSSCs have attracted much attention because of their easy fabrication and low cost28,29 and it can be regarded as a derivative of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). As well known, in QDSSCs, the competition between the transport of electrons through the photoanode and the recombination of electrons with the oxidation state of the electrolyte on the electrode/electrolyte interface determines the photoelectrical conversion efficiency.30 Incorporation of conductive graphene and carbon nanotubes has been reported as an effective approach to promote electron transport in the TiO2 photoanode.31 However, 2D graphene sheets easily form irreversible agglomerates because of π–π interaction, which may also decrease the efficiency of electron transport. Several complex methods have been used to mitigate the aggregation of graphene sheets, such as addition of co-agents to increase the interlayer distance,32 twisting the conjugated plane of graphene sheets to reduce π–π stacking33 and other methodologies involving template-assisted growth of 3D graphene structures.34 GNs and CD–G, on account of their unique structure and conductivity, are expected to be better alternatives. Zhu et al. reported that by incorporating 1.5 wt% 3D GNs into the TiO2 photoanode, a maximum power conversion efficiency of 4.2% for CdS/CdSe QDSSCs could be achieved.35 A continuous improvement in η of QDSSCs still needs to be carried out. In addition, incorporation of CD–G to the TiO2 photoanode for improving the photoelectric conversion efficiency of QDSSCs has yet to be reported.
Therefore, this work is specifically aimed at developing novel and effective methods to prepare 3D GNs and CD–G. Then these carbon nanomaterials with unique structures and morphologies were directly incorporated in TiO2 electrodes of CdS/CdSe QDSSCs for improving cell performance.
Experimental section
Materials
The conductive carbon black was purchased from Qingda Tianheda Graphite Co., Ltd. Natural graphite flakes (325 mesh, 99.8%) were purchased from Alfa Aesar. All chemicals are of analytical-reagent grade and were purchased from Aladdin and TCI without further purification. Deionized water with a resistivity of 18.1 MΩ cm was used for all.
Preparation of 3D GNs
Previously, we report on the successful preparation of high-quality graphene sheets with large-size in DMF solvent by sonication-free LPE.24 In this work, the exfoliation of the conductive carbon black assisted with urea to prepare 3D GNs was undertaken by using the reflux of the mixture in DMF and following centrifugation treatment and the extraction of the 3D GNs. In a typical process, 2.6 g of conductive carbon black and 102 g of urea were mixed in 80 mL of DMF at room temperature in an Erlenmeyer flask and then the mixture was allowed to stand for ca. 1 week to make the conductive carbon black wetted fully with DMF and urea molecules, followed by the increase in temperature to the boiling point of DMF (154 °C) and refluxed for 8 h. The resulting mixture was subsequently centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 20 min and the precipitate was discarded. Next, the dark gray supernatant was centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 20 min and washed with hot water to remove off urea and melamine. The resultant 3D GNs were dried at 50 °C in a vacuum oven.
Preparation of CD–G
GO sheets were prepared using a modified Hummers method.36 In a typical procedure, 1.5 g of graphite powder and 48 mL of concentrated sulfuric acid were added into a 250 mL flask. The mixture was stirred vigorously for 30 min. Next, 1.8 g of NaNO3 was added, followed by cooling of the mixture to 0 °C using an ice water bath. After continuous stirring for 1 h, 4.5 g of KMnO4 was added slowly over the course of 1 h. Subsequently, the system temperature was kept at 35 °C for 30 min. Then the reaction was quenched by adding 0.18 L of ice water and 15 mL of H2O2 (30%). The resultant GO was centrifuged and washed with plenty of water until no precipitation of BaSO4 occurred in the presence of the aqueous BaCl2 solution and the chloride test with AgNO3 was negative. The resultant product was dried at 50 °C for 24 h in a vacuum oven.
C dots were prepared following our previous report.37 Typically, 1g of C soot was obtained by the incomplete combustion of the polystyrene foam waste and 100 mL of 2.6 M nitric acid was mixed with the C soot, and then the mixture was refluxed for 5 h and dialysed against water. After the dialysis, the mixture was centrifuged to remove the black precipitate and the supernatant containing CDs was evaporated using a rotary evaporator to reduce water and then the resultant gum was dried at 50 °C for 24 h in a vacuum oven. Thus, C dot powder was achieved. In order to prepare CD–G, 24 mg of C dots was dispersed in 10 mL of deionized water, then 20 mg of 1-ethyl-3-(dimetylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) and 26 mg of N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide sodium salt (sulfo-NHS) were added into the dispersion to react for 30 min. Next, 32 mg of GO sheets were added into the above mixture with stirring at room temperature for 2 h.38 After that, 0.5 mL of hydrazine hydrate was added for the reduction of GO. Finally, the precipitate was centrifuged and washed with deionized water, and dried at 50 °C for 24 h in a vacuum oven. In order to compare the difference between C dots and CD–G hybrids in PL, for C dots, the control experiment was completed, that is, the same procedure without the addition of GO sheets. Thus, the amount of C dots in the two samples can be the same for PL measurements.
Fabrication of photoanodes and QDSSCs
Prior to the fabrication of mesoporous TiO2 films, FTO substrates were cleaned in detergent solution in an ultrasonic bath for 30 min, and were subsequently rinsed with ethanol and water, respectively. The certain amounts of 3D GN or CD–G, TiO2 (P25 Degussa), ethyl cellulose, ethanol and terpineol were mixed for making TiO2 paste. The mesoscopic TiO2, GN/TiO2 and CD–G/TiO2 films were prepared by the screen-printing method with the pastes on FTO glass, respectively, and then sintered at 450 °C for 30 min in air. The active areas of the films were 0.25 cm2 and the thicknesses of the annealed films were about 15 μm measured by profilometry (Dektak 6 from Veeco).
The TiO2, GN/TiO2 and CD–G/TiO2 films were sensitized in situ with CdS and CdSe by the successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) method.39 The films were immersed in 0.05 M Cd(Ac)2 aqueous solution for 3 min and rinsed with deionized water and ethanol for 30 s, respectively. Then dipped for an additional 3 min in 0.05 M Na2S aqueous solution and rinsed with water and ethanol for 30 s, respectively. All of these processes constituted one SILAR cycle. Similarly, the deposition of CdSe was also conducted with 0.05 M Cd(Ac)2 and 0.05 M Na2SeSO3 solutions by SILAR. NaSeSO3 solution was prepared by refluxing Se powder and NaSO3 at 96 °C.40 Different SILAR cycles of CdS and CdSe were conducted to investigate the optimal combination cycles of the two kinds of QDs for the best performance of solar cells. Finally, surface passivation with ZnS was conducted by alternately dipping the photoanodes into 0.05 M Zn(Ac)2 and 0.05 M Na2S aqueous solution for 1 min and for two cycles. Cu2S formed on a FTO sheet was employed as the counter electrode. The CdS/CdSe sensitized TiO2 or GN/TiO2 or CD–G/TiO2 photoanode and a Cu2S-coated FTO counter electrode were assembled into a sandwich-type cell and penetrated with a polysulfide electrolyte that consisted of 1 M Na2S and 1 M S in deionized water.
Characterization
TEM samples were prepared by depositing a few drops of the dispersion onto holey carbon grids (400 mesh). TEM images were captured on a Jeol JEM-2100F transmission electron microscope operated at 100 keV. Raman analysis was carried out by micro-Raman spectroscopy in confocal configuration (NT-MDT NTEGRA Spectra, with 532 nm laser). The FT-IR spectrum was recorded on a Magna-560 spectrophotometer using a KBr pellet. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Axis Ultra DLD) was used to characterize the elemental compositions of the surface of 3D GNs. The morphologies of TiO2, GN/TiO2, CD–G/TiO2 films were investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM, XL-30, FEG). The cross sectional sample and corresponding SEM-EDX elemental mapping were measured using a SEM instrument with an energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX). The electrical conductivity of GNs and CD–G was measured using a Four Probes Tech RTS-9 four-point-probe conductivity tester (Guangzhou, China) at ambient temperature. The samples were pressed at 5 MPa for electrical conductivity measurements. The ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra of the CdS/CdSe-sensitized photoanode films were recorded using a spectrophotometer (UV-3600, Shimadzu, Japan). PL spectra were recorded using a Cary Eclipse EL06063917 fluorescence spectrophotometer with a xenon arc lamp as the light source. The photocurrent–voltage (J–V) characteristics of solar cell devices were measured using a Keithley's series 2400 sourcemeter under an illumination of AM1.5 solar simulator (100 mW cm−2, Newport 91160). The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) of the corresponding devices was measured using a Crown instrument over the wavelength range from 300 to 800 nm. The photovoltage decay rates of the assembled CdS/CdSe QDSSCs were measured using a Tektronix 500 MHz oscilloscope.
Results and discussion
Generally, 3D GNs were prepared by assembling graphene sheets. However, driven by the strong π–π interaction between individual graphene sheets, graphene aggregates tend to be formed, which is not suitable for application in solar cells. In this work, 3D GNs were prepared in DMF solvent with urea as the precursor of intercalating agent melamine by sonication-free LPE. The morphology of the 3D GNs was characterized by TEM as shown in Fig. 1a. The TEM image of exfoliated 3D GNs reveals that in reticular space structures, interconnected microchannels of the 3D GNs are clearly seen, thus overcoming the restacking of graphene sheets and forming continuously cross-linked microchannels. An enlarged TEM image of the 3D GN is shown in Fig. 1b to further prove its hollow nature and it is apparent that the microchannel walls had a connected ribbon structure. One can see the wrinkled and folded morphology of the 3D GN. It was expected that such a structure can also provide better conductive contacts between the graphene ribbons.

We propose that the two factors resulted in the exfoliation of 3D GN from the conductive carbon black. First, the exfoliation of the conductive carbon black in DMF solvent could be assisted by forming intercalation agent melamine with urea. It is well known that urea can transfer into melamine at the boiling point of DMF (154 °C) and melamine was an excellent intercalation agent in the mill method for the preparation of single and few-layer graphene.41 Second, the morphology of exfoliated 3D GNs depends on the structure of conductive carbon black. Conductive carbon black consists of many grape-shape particles as shown in Fig. 1c. After careful observation, one can find that these particles are not isolated and are covered by larger carbon sheets. When conductive carbon black was exfoliated with melamine, grape-shape particles were removed off and the residue is interconnected larger carbon sheets. These carbon sheets were twisted and folded due to π–π interaction, resulting in the formation of 3D GNs. Fig. 1d is a typical TEM image of 3D GNs in which most of the carbon black particles have been removed off but a particle left is drawn with a red circle.
To determine the chemical nature of the 3D GNs, FTIR, Raman spectroscopic analysis and XPS were carried out. Nitrogen doping was evidenced by the appearance of a CN bond at 1558 cm−1 and a C–N bond at 1387 cm−1 in the FTIR spectrum of the 3D GN (Fig. 2a).42 In the first-order Raman spectrum of the 3D GN, a G band at 1572 cm−1 and a D band at 1341 cm−1 are observed and the iD/iG ratio is found to be 1.02 (Fig. 2b). It is well known that there are many defects in the structure of conductive carbon black due to the presence of many sp3 hybridized carbon–carbon bonds. It can be expected that in the structure of the 3D GNs, there are also many sp3 hybridized carbon–carbon bonds from a lot of edges and nitrogen doping, resulting in a higher iD/iG ratio. The wide scan XPS of the 3D GNs was obtained as shown in Fig. 2c. The characteristic C 1s, N 1s, and O 1s core-level photoemission peaks are at ∼285, ∼399 and ∼532 eV, respectively. The content of C, O or N is 91.8%, 4.3% or 3.9%. Previously, N-doped graphene was synthesized at 160 °C by the hydrothermal method with GO as raw material and urea as reducing-doping agents.43 In this work, N-doped GNs were prepared in DMF at 154 °C under normal pressure with conductive carbon black as raw material and urea as reducing-doping agents. This simple liquid phase method to produce N-doped GNs is a scalable and low-cost route that may open a way closer to practical applications.

On the other hand, CD–G was synthesized through a series of reactions as described in the scheme in Fig. 3. The carboxyls on C dots reacted with the hydroxyls on GO with the assistance of EDC and sulfo-NHS. Then, excess carboxyls on GO sheets reacted with hydrazine hydrate to form rGO sheets with higher conductivity.

TEM images of the CD–G hybrid are shown in Fig. 4a and b, in which CDs are uniformly anchored onto the surface of graphene sheets. The inset in Fig. 4a shows the C particle size distribution of CDs in the range of 2–8 nm. Fig. 4c shows the high resolution TEM image of the CD–G hybrid, in which the lattice spacing of 0.25 nm corresponds to the (100) crystal face of graphite and 0.34 nm interlayer spacing corresponds to (002) diffraction planes of graphitic carbons. Selected area electron diffraction (SAED) of the CD–G hybrid in Fig. 4d shows a ring-like diffraction pattern and dispersed bright spots with typical six fold symmetry characteristic diffraction. The diffraction rings could be indexed to the (002), (100), (101), (110) and (112) planes of C dots44 and the bright spots with typical six fold symmetry indicate graphene sheets with an ordered well-crystallized graphite structure.

Raman analysis was carried out by using a Raman microscope with an excitation laser of 532 nm to compare the Raman spectra taken for GO sheets, C dots and CD–G samples (see ESI,† Fig. S1). The iD/iG of CD–G is lower than those of GO sheets and C dots. The reason is that by the reduction, some carboxylic, hydroxyl and epoxy groups on the surfaces of GO sheets were reduced, resulting in more sp2 domains and the decrease of iD/iG. A previous research indicates that because of the higher percentage of sp2 carbon in r-GO (reduced graphene oxide) sheets a decrease in iD/iG was observed, which proves the increase of sp2 carbon in r-GO sheets.45 In this work, during the preparation of CD–G, GO sheets were reduced to r-GO sheets, meantime, C dots also were reduced. This resulted in the increase of the amount of sp2 carbon and the decrease of iD/iG in the CD–G hybrid.
In order to explore the surface area and pore-size distribution of the 3D GN and CD–G hybrid, about 120 mg of the graphene materials was activated at 150 °C for 8 h, and then the gas sorption experiment was performed at 77 K and 0–760 Torr on a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 instrument. As evident by the reversible type II N2 sorption isotherms (Fig. 5a), the estimated Langmuir surface area and BET surface area of N-doped 3D GNs are 98.1 m2 g−1 and 69.4 m2 g−1, respectively. The Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) pore-size distribution curve (Fig. 5b) shows two sharp peaks at 38 nm and 54 nm. For CD–G, the estimated Langmuir surface area and BET surface area are 57.1 m2 g−1 and 40.1 m2 g−1, respectively, from the reversible type II N2 sorption isotherms (Fig. 5c). The Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) pore-size distribution curve (Fig. 5d) shows that pore-size distribution of CD–G is in the range from 10 nm to 110 nm. This may be related to the fact that the sizes of C dots on graphene sheets are not uniform.

In order to fabricate CdS/CdSe QDSSCs, TiO2 film and TiO2 films doped with 3D GNs or CD–G hybrids on FTO glass plates were firstly prepared. The morphologies of the three films are shown in Fig. 6. Compared to the TiO2 film, more rough morphologies of TiO2 films doped with 3D GNs and CD–G hybrids are found. There are some large pores in the films, which could improve the absorption ability of the films to the sensitizer.35 The amount of 3D GNs or CD–G hybrids in the TiO2 electrode is little (1.6 wt% or 2.0%), so the SEM is difficult to distinguish between the arrangement of 3D GNs and CD–G hybrids in TiO2 films.
 Fig. 6  (a) SEM image of pure TiO2 film. (b) SEM image of 1.6 wt% GN/TiO2 film. (c) SEM image of 2.0 wt% CD–G/TiO2 film. 
Then, the CdS/CdSe sensitized TiO2, GN/TiO2 and CD–G/TiO2 photoanodes were prepared by SILAR. To get the best photovoltaic performance the experimental conditions such as the SILAR circles of CdS and CdSe as well as the content of 3D GN or CD–G have been optimized (see ESI,† Tables S1–S3). The best CD–G/TiO2 film with 2.0 wt% CD–G was scratched off the fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass, dispersed in ethanol, and dropped onto the TEM grid to make images of the components. From Fig. 7a, it can be observed that some TiO2 nanoparticles are attached onto the graphene sheets decorated with C dots and the TiO2 particles are attached with CdS/CdSe QDs (black dots). Fig. 7b shows the magnified HRTEM image for the marked regions in Fig. 7a. CDs are anchored onto the graphene sheets and their sizes are in the range of 2–8 nm. From the HR-TEM images shown in Fig. 7c–f, we can point out some important aspects: the larger crystallite appearing in the left region of Fig. 7c is identified to be TiO2. The lattice spacing measured for this crystalline plane is 0.352 nm, corresponding to the (101) plane of anatase TiO2 (JCPDS 21-1272). Around the TiO2 crystallite, the two crystallites connecting to TiO2 particles have a lattice fringe of 0.335 nm, which is ascribed to the (111) plane of CdS (JCPDS 80-0019), and their shapes were hemispherical, facing towards the TiO2 surface. The outer layer crystallite with a lattice spacing of 0.372 nm, next to the CdS layer, corresponds to the (100) plane of CdSe (JCPDS 77-2307). The obvious core/shell CdS/CdSe structures are found in Fig. 7d. The CdS cores have a lattice fringe of 0.21 nm, which is ascribed to the (220) plane of CdS and CdSe shells have a lattice spacing of 0.215 nm, corresponding to the (110) plane of CdSe. The sizes of the CdS cores and the thicknesses of the CdSe shells range from 8 to 12 nm and from 3 to 7 nm, respectively. The wurtzite phase of ZnS with a lattice fringe of 0.332 (100) [JCPDS no. 75-1547] can also be observed. It exists in a small amount so that continuous ZnS shell cannot be formed (Fig. 7e). In addition, a C dot that locates outside the CdSe layer also can be seen (Fig. 7f). The cross-sectional SEM image of the as-prepared CdS/CdSe sensitized CD–G/TiO2 film and the corresponding EDX elemental mapping are shown (see ESI,† Fig. S2). The distribution of C, O, Zn, Se, Si, S, Cd and Ti is revealed. The results confirm that CdS, CdSe, and ZnS nanocrystals have been successfully deposited on the surface of the CD–G/TiO2 film and C exists in the film.

I–V curves of the CdS/CdSe QDSSCs with TiO2, 1.6 wt% GN/TiO2 and 2.0 wt% CD–G/TiO2 photoanodes are shown in Fig. 8a and detailed photovoltaic parameters are indicated in Table 1. For 1.6 wt% GN/TiO2 and 2 wt% CD–G/TiO2 photoanodes, η exhibited the improvement from 4.04% to 4.37% and 4.69%, respectively. The values are 8.2% and 16.1% higher than that of the TiO2 photoanode. These improvements in η of CdS/CdSe QDSSCs are primarily the results from the increase in Jsc. Fig. 8b shows the IPCE curves for the QDSSCs constructed with TiO2, GN/TiO2 and CD–G/TiO2 photoanodes, respectively. The maximum values of 63.6%, 71.9% and 76.6% were obtained for pure TiO2, 1.6 wt% GN/TiO2 and 2.0 wt% CD–G/TiO2 photoanodes. This increase trend in IPCE is similar to that in Jsc. The evolution of the η losses for TiO2, GN/TiO2 and CD–G/TiO2 films based on solar cells is 1.72%, 1.68% and 1.70% after two weeks. The stabilities of GN/TiO2 and CD–G/TiO2 anodes did not show an obvious enhancement.

Adding GNs and CD–G into the TiO2 porous photoanode has been shown to significantly improve the cell efficiency by increasing the current density (Jsc) of the solar cells. The origin of the beneficial effect of the GNs and CD–G on the solar cell Jsc is proposed as follows:
Firstly, as compared with pure TiO2 film, GN/TiO2 and CD–G/TiO2 films show structures with larger pores due to the specific structures of GNs and CD–G, which favor easy penetration of the Cd and S precursors during deposition. Fig. 9 shows the UV-vis absorption spectra of the CdS/CdSe sensitized TiO2, GN/TiO2 and CD–G/TiO2 films (6 cycles of CdS SILAR, 6 cycles of CdSe SILAR and 2 cycles of ZnS SILAR). It is found that all the photoanode films have strong absorbance from 300 nm to 750 nm, which are ascribed to the contribution from CdS and CdSe QDs. In addition, it is clearly found that the absorbance intensities of CdS/CdSe sensitized GN/TiO2 and CD–G/TiO2/films were higher than that of CdS/CdSe sensitized TiO2 film, indicating that more CdS/CdSe QDs have been deposited on the TiO2 film with the incorporation of GNs or CD–G. Such an increased amount of CdS/CdSe should be due to the increase of larger pores when GNs and CD–G were introduced into TiO2 film. As a result, the excited electrons from the sensitizer to the conduction band of TiO2 were increased.

Secondly, the work function of graphene (−4.4 to −4.5 eV) is localized below the conduction band of TiO2 (−4.2 eV) and may favor the charge extraction from TiO2.46,47 It was reported that graphene was the electron acceptor in TiO2/graphene35 and the electron transport from TiO2 to graphene decreased the probability of recombination of charge carriers and ultimately improved the photoelectrical conversion efficiency.35 However, for 2D G/TiO2 and 3D GN/TiO2 photoanodes, the electron transport efficiencies are different. 2D G/TiO2 and 3D/TiO2 films were scratched off the FTO glass, dispersed in ethanol, and dropped onto the TEM grid to make images of the components. For 2D G/TiO2, some TiO2 nanoparticle aggregates were attached on graphene sheets and the poor contact between graphene sheets and TiO2 nanoparticles is found (Fig. 10a). The poor contact is not beneficial for the electron transport from TiO2 to graphene. From Fig. 10b, it can be found that 3D GN/TiO2 is constructed regularly by continuous and curved graphene ribbons and the TiO2 nanoparticles. The TiO2 nanoparticles fill in the network channels. The graphene networks act as bridges for the connection between different TiO2 nanoparticles, which favors the electron transport from TiO2 to graphene and collection electrons from TiO2 to the conductive substrate quickly without obstruction. Therefore, η of 3D GN/TiO2 based on QDSSCs is higher than that of 2D G/TiO2 based on QDSSCs (Fig. 10c).

Thirdly, for CD–G, absorption throughout the visible and near-infrared wavelength region renders C dots as potentially useful sensitizers for photovoltaic applications.48 As shown in Fig. 11a, the absorbed wavelength of C dots is in the range from 300 nm to 750 nm, and the absorption peak appeared at around 430 nm (Fig. 11a). On the other hand, the electron transport also generated from C dots to graphene sheets. When the C dots and CD–G hybrid were excited at 365 nm, the fluorescence intensity of C dots in the CD–G hybrid was obviously lower than that of the C dots alone (Fig. 11b). The normalized PL spectra on the dots and CD–G have been recorded (see ESI,† Fig. S3). Fluorescence quenching measurements provide an unambiguous proof of electron transfer from C dots to graphene sheets, thus confirming the role of C dots in facilitating charge propagation. Therefore, CD–G nanocomposites had the potential for photovoltaic applications as a QDSSC active material. However, the general description of C dots is that of nanometer sized particles consisting of the sp2 hybridized graphitic core functionalized with polar carboxyl groups on the surface. The chemically inert surface made it hard for CQDs to attach to graphene sheets. In this work, CQDs were covalently bonded onto graphene sheets by forming an ester group. Thus, incorporation and treatment of TiO2 film could hardly result in the detachment of C dots from graphene sheets. The excited electrons could be more effectively transferred from CQDs to the graphene sheets. Also, C dots can hinder the agglomerates of graphene sheets, which may also increase the efficiency of electron transport. As a result, the photovoltaic conversion efficiency of QDSSCs based on such CD–G active material was obviously increased. It was not only higher than GN/TiO2 film based on QDSSCs, but also considerably higher than TiO2 film based on QDSSCs. Fig. 11c shows the schematic diagram of energy levels of FTO, graphene and C dots and the stepwise energy levels are beneficial for electrons to transport from the conduction band of C dots to the FTO substrate.

Finally, the higher conductivity of GNs and CD–G allowed the excited electrons to be more effectively transferred from the GN/TiO2 or CD–G/TiO2 film to FTO. To measure the electrical conductivity of the 3D GNs and CD–G hybrid the circular membrane consisting of the 3D GNs or CD–G hybrid was prepared using the tabletting machine. The conductivities of the 3D GN and CD–G hybrid membranes were measured to be 2080 S m−1 and 3600 S m−1 using the four probe measurement technique.
However, η decreased when the content of GN or CD–G in the TiO2 photoanode further increased. The reason is probably that the excessive GNs or CD–G may act as a recombination center instead of providing electron pathways. 1.6 wt% GN and 2.0 wt% CD–G are optimized incorporating concentrations (see ESI,† Fig. S4).
In the hybrid photoanode of QDSSCs, a mesoporous TiO2 film with the incorporation of GNs or CD–G that is attached to FTO glass. These TiO2 nanoparticles offer high porosity for sensitizer adsorption and the diffusion and storage of the electrolyte. The CdS/CdSe QDs are subsequently absorbed in the GN/TiO2 or CD–G/TiO2 film, which leads to photon absorption and electron injection. The excited QDs inject the electrons from their conduction band (CB) into the CB of TiO2. The 3D GN acts as a bridge for the connection between different TiO2 nanoparticles, which favors the electron transport from TiO2 to graphene and collected electrons transport from TiO2 to the conductive substrate quickly. For CD–G, absorption throughout the visible and near-infrared wavelength region of C dots renders them as a sensitizer for photovoltaic applications, and the excited electrons could be more effectively transferred from CQDs to the graphene sheets, which may increase the amount of electron transport.
Based on J–V results, the GN/TiO2 and CD–G/TiO2 based on QDSSCs display higher Voc values (0.578 V and 0.580 V) compared to TiO2 based on QDSSCs. It is well known that the recombination resistance plays an important role in exerting the Voc value in QDSSCs.
To further understand the recombination kinetics of the CdS/CdSe QDSSCs fabricated using different TiO2 photoanodes, the open-circuit voltage decay (OCVD) measurements were carried out under switching off the light. The open-circuit voltage decay curves for three photoanodes are shown in Fig. 12. It is known that the photovoltage is very sensitive to the electron lifetime and will decay sharply along with time. The quantitative formula is as follows:49  where KB is the Boltzmann constant (1.38 × 10−23 J k−1), and Voc and τn are open circuit voltage and electron lifetime, respectively. Clearly, the photovoltage decay rate of these three types of cells decreases in an order of TiO2, GN/TiO2 and CD–G/TiO2 based on QDSSCs, implying a decline trend of electron back recombination rates in the same order because the electron back recombination rate is proportional to the voltage decay rate. Therefore, the slowest voltage decay rate for CD–G/TiO2 based on QDSSCs can be observed in Fig. 12, indicating that the electron back recombination rate of this cell is also the slowest. Thereby, an appropriate ratio of CD–G in TiO2 can obviously enhance the photovoltaic performance of CdS/CdSe QDSSCs.

Conclusion
In summary, we firstly developed simple methods for fabricating 3D GNs and CD–G hybrids with unique structures and morphologies. The features of the 3D GN and CD–G hybrid have been confirmed by the characterization techniques including TEM, Raman, FTIR and XPS techniques. The 3D GNs and CD–G hybrid can be directly incorporated into TiO2 photoanodes for improving the photovoltaic performance of CdS/CdSe QDSSCs. The results indicate that η exhibited the improvements from 4.04% to 4.37% and 4.69%, respectively, when the amounts of incorporation are 1.6 wt% for GNs and 2.0 wt% for CD–G. The improvements in η mainly resulted from the fact that the electron transport from TiO2 and C dots to graphene decreased the probability of recombination of charge carriers and ultimately improved the photoelectric conversion efficiency. The overall results suggest that the simple liquid phase reaction methods to produce 3D GNs and CD–G hybrids are scalable and low-cost routes that may open a way closer to practical applications in the area of solar cells.
