    , Accepted 5th November 2019First published on 5th November 2019AbstractA facile template-engaged strategy is developed to synthesize hollow NiFe mixed metal oxyphosphide spheres using different Fe ions (Fe2+ and Fe3+) as modulators. Benefiting from the optimized compositional and structural features, the as-obtained hollow spheres show excellent performance for the oxygen evolution reaction.
To address the problem of global warming and increasing energy demand, developing a green and sustainable energy resource to replace fossil fuels is considered as a major strategy.1 H2, with a high heating value but zero carbon emission, is expected to play a significant role in the blueprint for a sustainable energy future.2,3 Alkaline water electrolysis is a promising method to produce H2 on a large scale, as it can be a part of the future energy landscape when electricity is generated from sustainable energy like solar power effectively.4,5 However, it suffers from low efficiency because of the sluggish kinetics of two half reactions: the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The OER, a four-electron involved reaction, is especially complicated and extensively conceived as a constraint on electrochemical water splitting.6 Therefore, electrocatalysts that can effectively lower the energy barrier of the OER are largely needed. Ru/Ir-based materials are benchmarks for the OER electrocatalysts; however, their scarcity and high cost make large-scale applications impractical.7 To find lower-cost electrocatalysts without compromising the catalytic activity remains a hot topic and much progress has been unremittingly made.5–7
Transition-metal based compounds such as metal oxides,8 oxy/hydroxides,9 chalcogenides,10 nitrides,11 and phosphides12 have recently emerged as promising candidates to accelerate the kinetics of the OER. Among them, metal phosphides, which have previously been shown as active HER electrocatalysts,13 are regarded as promising pre-catalysts for the OER recently because of the high conductivity and quick in situ transformation into active species (oxide, hydroxide, etc.) under alkaline conditions.14–17 Ni2P has been one of the prominent representatives since Hu et al. first reported that it showed high activity in alkaline OER.16 Since then, nanostructured Ni2P with different morphologies have been reported.18–20 It is also found that the introduction of Fe can alter the active sites and ultimately influence the rate-determining step of the OER, thus improving the OER performance of Ni2P.21–23 By optimizing the composition of Fe, the OER performance of Ni2P is expected to be further improved.24
Apart from composition design, constructing the desired nanostructure with abundant active sites can also enhance the electrochemical performance of electrocatalysts.25,26 Hollow structure is one of the advanced structures with large surface area. The electrolyte-accessible area can expose more active sites and provide a fast mass and charge transport pathway to enhance the kinetics of water splitting.27 Therefore, by constructing hollow nanostructured electrocatalysts with the adjusted chemical composition, a potential synergistic effect of the composition and the structure can be anticipated. However, the synthesis of well-defined hollow NiFe mixed metal oxyphosphide spheres with a tunable Fe concentration for the OER is rarely reported.
Herein, a novel template-engaged strategy is developed to construct hollow NiFe mixed metal oxyphosphide (denoted as H-NiFe oxyphosphide) spheres using yolk-shelled nickel glycerate (denoted as YS-Ni-gly) spheres as the precursor, as schematically illustrated in Fig. 1. Fe ions with different valence states (Fe2+ and Fe3+) are employed as modulators. In step I, the core of the YS-Ni-gly sphere is selectively removed by using Fe3+ aqueous solution at ambient temperature for 2 hours. Subsequently, Fe is introduced into hollow Ni-gly (denoted as H-Ni-gly) spheres through an ion-exchange reaction with Fe2+ to generate hollow NiFe mixed metal glycerate (denoted as H-NiFe-gly) spheres (step II). Finally the as-obtained H-NiFe-gly spheres are transformed into H-NiFe oxyphosphide spheres by phosphorization (step III). Benefiting from the desirable structural and compositional features, the as-synthesized H-NiFe oxyphosphide spheres exhibit enhanced electrochemical performance for the OER.
 Fig. 1  Schematic illustration of the formation of H-NiFe oxyphosphide spheres: (I) the reaction of YS-Ni-gly spheres with Fe(NO3)3, (II) the reaction of H-Ni-gly spheres with FeSO4, and (III) phosphorization of H-NiFe-gly spheres. 
YS-Ni-gly spheres are first prepared by a reported hydrothermal method.28 The field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images (Fig. S1, ESI†) show that the as-prepared YS-Ni-gly spheres are uniform with a diameter of around 600 nm. A solid core with a diameter of about 250 nm can be clearly seen in the interior. After reaction with Fe(NO3)3, the core of YS-Ni-gly spheres is selectively etched out while the shell structure is well maintained (Fig. 2a and b). X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements indicate that the glycerate phase structure is not changed during the reaction with Fe3+ (Fig. S2, ESI†). It is found that the etching of the core in YS-Ni-gly completes in 2 hours (Fig. S3, ESI†). The EDX spectrum shows that negligible Fe remains in the product after etching, evidencing that the etching process will not bring evident Fe into Ni-gly (Fig. S4, ESI†). With the reaction time being prolonged to 4 hours, the sphere is broken (Fig. S5a, ESI†) and will completely dissolve after 12 hours (Fig. S5b, ESI†). The HCl solution with the same pH as that of Fe(NO3)3 solution is used to react with YS-Ni-gly spheres. However, the yolk-shelled structure is not changed, excluding the possible effect of the pH (Fig. S6, ESI†). On the other hand, when replacing Fe(NO3)3 with FeCl3, the hollow structure can still be obtained (Fig. S7, ESI†), demonstrating the etching effect of Fe3+ in the hollowing process.

After further reaction with FeSO4 solution (5 mg mL−1), the hollow structure still remains intact (Fig. 2c and d). The energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectrum confirms the incorporation of Fe into H-Ni-gly spheres (Fig. S8, ESI†), while the glycerate phase structure is maintained (Fig. S2, ESI†).29 Unlike Fe3+, Fe2+ cannot make YS-Ni-gly spheres dissolve in the solution (Fig. S9, ESI†). A possible ion-exchange reaction may occur between Fe2+ and Ni2+ in H-Ni-gly.
Further phosphorization process is performed by annealing the as-synthesized metal glycerate spheres with NaH2PO2. Fig. 3a shows the diffraction peaks of the as-obtained phosphorization products. The diffraction peaks of H-NiFe oxyphosphide spheres can be indexed to the hexagonal Ni2P (JCPDS card no. 03-0953) phase. The broad peak located at 25° corresponds to the (002) plane of graphite carbon coming from glycerol during calcination. The EDX spectrum demonstrates the existence of Ni, Fe, P, C, and O elements with an Ni/Fe ratio of 3:1 in H-NiFe oxyphosphide spheres (Fig. S10, ESI†). The large amount of O content indicates the formation of oxyphosphide.12 In addition, the Raman spectrum with obvious D-band and G-band peaks at 1350 cm−1 and 1570 cm−1, respectively, confirms the existence of amorphous carbon in H-NiFe oxyphosphide spheres (Fig. S11, ESI†). The FESEM images (Fig. 3b and c) show that the spherical structures of the glycerate spheres are well preserved with a slight size shrinkage. Fig. 3c clearly reveals that the surface of the H-NiFe oxyphosphide spheres constructed by small nanoparticles is highly rough. The hollow interior can be clearly observed from the TEM images (Fig. 3d and e). A higher magnification TEM image further demonstrates the porous structure of the shell (Fig. 3e). High-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) and the corresponding elemental mapping images show the uniform distribution of all the elements. Lattice fringes with an interplanar spacing of 0.196 nm corresponding to the (210) plane of hexagonal Ni2P can be clearly seen in the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image (Fig. S12, ESI†), which is consistent with the XRD result.

For comparison, yolk-shelled nickel oxyphosphide (denoted as YS-Ni oxyphosphide) spheres (Fig. S13, ESI†), hollow Ni oxyphosphide (denoted as H-Ni oxyphosphide) spheres (Fig. S14, ESI†), and yolk-shelled nickel iron mixed metal oxyphosphide (denoted as YS-NiFe oxyphosphide) spheres (Fig. S15, ESI†) are also prepared with YS-Ni-gly, H-Ni-gly, and yolk-shelled NiFe mixed metal gly (denoted as YS-NiFe-gly) spheres as precursors, respectively. The XRD patterns confirm the formation of the corresponding oxyphosphides (Fig. S16, ESI†). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements are conducted to compare the element states of these samples (Fig. S17, ESI†). As to the Ni 2p XPS spectra of H-NiFe oxyphosphide spheres, the two main peaks at 853.4 and 856.6 eV in the Ni 2p3/2 region can be assigned to Niδ+ (partially charged Ni species) in the Ni–P compound30 and oxidized Ni species, respectively.31 In the Fe 2p spectrum, the peaks at around 707.2 and 710.6 eV are ascribed to the Fe–P bond32 and Fe2+, respectively.33 The peak in the P 2p spectrum located at 129.5 eV can be attributed to the reduced P (Pδ−) and the binding energy of 133.9 eV is related to phosphate species which may come from surface oxidation.19,32 As can be seen, the binding energies of Ni 2p3/2 (853.4 eV) shift positively in the NiFe-based oxyphosphide compared with Ni-based oxyphosphide (853.2 eV), suggesting the possible electron transfer from Ni.
The alkaline OER performance of the as-synthesized oxyphosphide spheres is tested in 1 M KOH solution using a standard three-electrode cell. Fig. 4a shows the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves of different catalysts with IR correction. To reach a current density of 10 mA cm−2, the H-NiFe oxyphosphide spheres only need an overpotential of 253 mV. This performance is superior to that of YS-NiFe oxyphosphide spheres (274 mV), H-Ni oxyphosphide spheres (286 mV), YS-Ni oxyphosphide spheres (290 mV), and commercial RuO2 (373 mV). Tafel plots are further derived from the corresponding LSV curves to characterize the kinetics performance of the catalysts. As shown in Fig. 4b, the Tafel slope of H-NiFe oxyphosphide spheres (59 mV dec−1) is the smallest compared with that of the other control samples, demonstrating favourable kinetics for the OER. This contrast implies that the advanced performance of H-NiFe oxyphosphide could be attributed to the hollow structure and incorporation of Fe. The low values of overpotential and Tafel slope make H-NiFe oxyphosphide spheres a top-level electrocatalyst when compared with other recently reported metal phosphide-based catalysts for the OER (Table S1, ESI†). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy tests are conducted at an overpotential of 300 mV to probe the resistance during the OER process. It can be clearly seen that the H-NiFe oxyphosphide spheres exhibit the lowest charge-transfer resistance. Furthermore, the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) is also a criterion for electrocatalysts. To evaluate the ECSA of different samples, the proportional parameter electrochemical double-layer capacitance (Cdl) is calculated and compared (Fig. S18, ESI†). The H-NiFe oxyphosphide spheres exhibit the highest value of Cdl, implying more exposure of active sites. The turnover frequency (TOF) is also calculated (Fig. S19, ESI†). The calculated TOF of H-NiFe oxyphosphide spheres is 0.36 s−1 at an overpotential of 300 mV, outperforming those of the other control samples including YS-NiFe oxyphosphide spheres (0.311 s−1 at 300 mV), H-Ni oxyphosphide spheres (0.086 s−1 at 300 mV) and YS-Ni oxyphosphide spheres (0.078 s−1 at 300 mV). The highest TOF value of H-NiFe oxyphosphide spheres suggests the excellent intrinsic activity brought by Fe incorporation and hollow structuring.

To investigate the effect of the incorporated Fe concentration on the OER performance, H-Ni-gly spheres first react with FeSO4 solution with two other concentrations (2.5 and 7.5 mg mL−1). The SEM images show that with an increase of the FeSO4 concentration, the H-Ni-gly precursors broke a little (Fig. S20, ESI†). After phosphorization, the corresponding oxyphosphide sample is denoted as NFOP-1 and NFOP-2, respectively (Fig. S21–S23, ESI†). The atomic ratio of Ni/Fe in NFOP-1 and NFOP-2 is around 4:1 and 2.5:1, respectively (Fig. S21c and S22c, ESI†). The OER performance of NFOP-1 and NFOP-2 is then tested and compared with that of H-NiFe oxyphosphide spheres with an Ni/Fe atomic ratio of about 3:1 (Fig. S24, ESI†). As can be observed, NFOP-1 and NFOP-2 show inferior OER performance to H-NiFe oxyphosphide spheres, evidencing the important role of the composition and the structure in the OER performance.
To access the long-term stability performance of H-NiFe and H-Ni oxyphosphide spheres, chronoamperometric tests are conducted for 20 hours at a static overpotential of 270 mV (Fig. 4d). The current density of H-NiFe oxyphosphide spheres remains at around 20 mA cm−2 with less than 10% decrease after 20 hours. Their current density and retention rate are obviously superior to those of H-Ni oxyphosphide spheres. Besides, the polarization curves of H-NiFe oxyphosphide before and after 20 hours of the stability test show a negligible difference (Fig. S25, ESI†), demonstrating the decent stability of H-NiFe oxyphosphide spheres. After a constant OER process, the structural and compositional changes in the H-NiFe oxyphosphide spheres are characterized. The morphology of the hollow spheres is mostly preserved as evidenced by the SEM and TEM images (Fig. S26a–c, ESI†). Elements like Ni, Fe, C and O are homogeneously distributed throughout the shell of the hollow sphere except P (Fig. S26d–h, ESI†). The XPS spectra after OER tests in contrast with the spectra before the tests are shown in Fig. S26i–k (ESI†). For the Ni 2p XPS spectrum, the peak at 853.4 eV assigned to Niδ+ in Ni–P bonding disappears (Fig. S26i, ESI†), while for the Fe 2p XPS spectrum, only one peak at around 710 eV appears (Fig. S26j, ESI†). Moreover, no P signals are found in the P 2p spectrum (Fig. S26k, ESI†), demonstrating the depletion of element P. Similar to the XPS result, element P almost completely disappears in the EDX spectrum (Fig. S27, ESI†), which indicates irreversible conversion during the OER process.19 The XRD pattern of the sample after the stability test can be indexed to Ni(OH)2·0.75H2O (JCPDS card no. 38-0715) (Fig. S28, ESI†). The HRTEM image shows that many little crystalline nanograins appear (Fig. S29, ESI†). The interplanar spacing of the fringes for these nanograins can be indexed to the (006) plane of NiOOH (JCPDS card no. 06-0075). The above XRD and HRTEM results suggest that the original metal oxyphosphide has been transformed into active metal oxyhydroxide/hydroxide during the OER process.34 The in situ transformed metal oxyhydroxide/hydroxide also shows superior OER performance to the directly prepared NiFe-layered double hydroxide (Fig. S30, ESI†), indicating that the mixed metal oxyphosphide sphere can act as an efficient precursor to generate more active hydroxide/oxyhydroxide species, thus showing significantly improved activity. Remarkably, the H-NiFe oxyphosphide spheres also exhibit good 2e−-based oxygen reduction reaction performance for H2O2 production with high selectivity and stability (Fig. S31, ESI†).
In summary, by accurately tuning the content and valence states of Fe ions, we have successfully used them as modulators to prepare hollow NiFe mixed metal glycerate spheres. After a subsequent phosphorization process, hollow NiFe mixed oxyphosphide spheres can be obtained. With the optimized Ni/Fe ratio, these hollow NiFe mixed oxyphosphide spheres can act as advanced OER pre-catalysts with an overpotential of only 253 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm−2 and a small Tafel slope of only 59 mV dec−1. Additionally, these spheres can also endure more than 20 hours of a continuous OER process at an overpotential of 270 mV. The enhanced OER performance may benefit from a synergy between the optimized chemical composition and the subtly constructed hollow structure. The synthetic strategy developed here provides new insights into the preparation of multi-metal based hollow nanostructured materials for other energy-related applications.
