    , Accepted 22nd August 2019First published on 22nd August 2019AbstractIn this work, two novel polymeric semiconductors (D2 and D3), with perfluorinated side chains in their backbone, were developed. Moreover, a novel small molecule (D1), with a similar structure to polymers D2 and D3, was also designed for comparison purposes. Compounds D1–D3 were successfully synthesized, completely characterized and used as additives in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The novel materials contain 26 fluorine atoms per unit, which is the largest amount of fluorine atoms reported for additives in PSCs. In this regard, D1–D3 were incorporated into the perovskite layer as additives and their effect on the film formation, stability and performance of PSCs was studied. As a result, D1–D3-based devices showed very good performances comparable to devices fabricated without additives and an increased stability. Thus, D1- and D2-fabricated devices retained 94 and 85% of their initial power, respectively, after 80 min under a bias, while the reference devices broke down completely. These results illustrate the extraordinary protective action of the perfluorinated polymers against humidity and oxygen, even at a low concentration of 2 mg ml−1 used in our experiments.
Introduction
Over the past ten years, we have witnessed the rise of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), one of the most impressive developments in the history of photovoltaics. PSCs have gained considerable research attention and have emerged as extremely promising candidates for photovoltaic technology due to their remarkable photovoltaic performance and potentially low production cost.1 In fact, in only 10 years of development, PSCs have reached efficiencies above 24%.2 However, this exceptionally fast growth is not yet enough to guarantee a spot in the market of solar cells, which is still led by silicon solar cells. Among the challenges to be addressed, stability remains one of the biggest issues to be resolved.3 More specifically, this type of device suffers from a number of degradation processes mostly associated with the degradation of the perovskite active layer.4 However, stability issues related to interfacial degradation under operation or chemical instability of the charge-transporting layers and electrodes have also been reported.5 Different strategies for stabilizing the active layer have been explored, including compositional engineering,6 controlled morphology,7 grain size control,8 perovskite deposition techniques,9,10 interfacial engineering, and many others.11,12 For instance, Saliba and co-workers showed that adding CsI to the FA(1−x)MAxPbI(3−y)Bry perovskite leads to improved efficiency, stability and reproducibility.13 The triple cation (MA, FA, and Cs) is the state-of-the-art perovskite and in the last few years the scientific community has strongly focused on it with the aim of improving the overall performance of PSCs.14 An easy-to-implement approach is the use of additives, which in small quantities fine-tune the materials properties and increase the stability of the devices.15–18 Such additives or dopants could be organic or inorganic salts which can be incorporated into the perovskite material, but can also be neutral compounds which are simply blended within the perovskite layer.19,20 Rational design of these additives can introduce different functionalities and target specific interactions between the stabilizer and the perovskite, or specific properties such as hydrophobicity, surface passivation, high-quality crystal growth, etc.21 For instance, polymeric additives with different functional fragments in their structure have found application as stabilizing additives in the perovskite layer. The main advantage of using functional polymers as additives is that the long polymeric chains are able to network crystalline domains and form compact films.22–24 In a recent work, polymers containing electron-donating S, N and O atoms were tested as additives within the perovskite layer, and it was found that they could effectively passivate the non-coordinating Pb2+ thanks to the electron lone pair in the heteroatoms.25 Furthermore, these heteroatoms can form hydrogen bonds with the organic fragments in the perovskite, which facilitates the formation of a compact protecting barrier on top of the perovskite crystals.23,26
On the other hand, taking into account that humidity and thermal instability have a huge impact on the performance of PSCs, there is a need for materials that can protect them from these external factors. In this regard, fluorinated compounds generally have excellent moisture and thermal resistance properties. For instance, Bella, Griffini, Correa-Baena and co-workers developed a fluorinated polymer coating for PSCs. Devices coated with the polymer reached an efficiency of nearly 19% and a device lifetime of over 6 months under ambient conditions.27 Moreover, it has been already proven in the literature that the incorporation of highly fluorinated alkyl chains into materials effectively enhances the stability towards air and temperature due to the formation of kinetic barriers against the diffusion of O2 and/or H2O.28 In this sense, fluorine-containing organic additives have already been used as additives within the perovskite layer, resulting in retarded degradation of PSCs in ambient air.29–33 These additives can tune the morphology and enhance the environmental stability of the perovskite layer.29,34
Although such additives lead to enhanced perovskite films, the inherent insulating properties of most of them could prevent the efficient extraction and transport of charge carriers, which could limit the applicability of this approach. For this reason, employing semiconducting additives that improve not only the stability but also the device performance by simultaneously yielding large-sized perovskite grains and improving charge extraction and transport is of paramount importance.35,36
Considering all these requisites, we have decided to combine the moisture resistance properties of fluorinated molecules with the benefits of using semiconducting polymers as additives in PSCs. Herein we report the design and synthesis of two novel polymeric materials (D2 and D3) with perfluorinated chains in their structure, which can be used as additives in PSCs for enhancing their stability. We have also designed a small molecule (D1), which bears an identical perfluorinated fragment and a similar structure to that of the backbone of the novel polymers, for comparison purposes. To the best of our knowledge, the three novel materials (D1–D3) contain the largest amount of fluorine atoms reported for additives in PSCs.
To ensure compatibility of the additives with the perovskite material and non-hindered charge transport, we chose the hole-transporting triarylamine unit as the backbone.
These novel materials have been synthesized, fully characterized and incorporated into the perovskite layer as additives. In this regard, their effect on the perovskite film formation, stability and performance of PSCs has been studied. The new molecules were found to be useful for improving the stability of PSCs without damaging the device performance, illustrating the outstanding capabilities of perfluorinated polymers.
Experimental
Materials
Chemicals and solvents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and Acros Organics, and used as received without further purification. The anhydrous solvent was dried using a Pure Solve solvent purification system. Column chromatography was carried out using silica gel (40 to 60 μm, 60 Å) from Fisher as the stationary phase, and TLC was performed on pre-coated silica gel and observed under UV light.
The materials used in the photovoltaic study were obtained from commercial suppliers in high purity and used without further purification: glass/fluorine-doped thin oxide (FTO, Nippon Sheet Glass), methylammonium iodide (MAI, DYESOL), PbI2 (99.99%, TCI Chemicals), 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis[N,N-di(4-methoxyphenyl)amino]-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD, Solarpur), lithium bis(trifluoromethane) sulfonimidate (LiTFSI, 99.9%, Sigma-Aldrich), tert-butylpyridine (TBP, Sigma-Aldrich), tris(2-(1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-4-tert-butylpyridine)cobalt(III) tri[bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide] (FK209, Dyenamo), DMSO (extra dry, Acros Organics), acetone (technical grade, Scharlab), chlorobenzene (extra dry, Acros Organics) and acetonitrile (extra dry, Acros Organics).
Compound characterization

Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. 
The 1H NMR, 13C NMR and 19F NMR spectra were recorded on Bruker NMR spectrometers (300 MHz, 400 MHz and 500 MHz for 1H NMR, 75 MHz, 100 MHz and 125 Hz for 13C NMR and 376 MHz for 19F NMR) at room temperature. Coupling constants (J) are denoted in Hz and chemical shifts (δ) in ppm. Abbreviations of coupling patterns are as follows: s, singlet; d, doublet; t, triplet; and m, multiplet.


Mass spectrometry. 
Matrix assisted laser desorption ionization (coupled to a time-of-flight analyzer) experiments (MALDI-TOF) were carried out on a Bruker REFLEX spectrometer. Electrospray ionization (ESI) measurements were carried out on a HPLC Agilent 1200 Series system coupled to a hybrid quadrupole-time of flight (LC-QTOF) mass spectrometer Agilent 6520 from Agilent Technologies (Santa Clara, CA, USA).


Infrared spectroscopy (attenuated total reflectance). 
The spectrum was recorded on a Bruker ALPHA ATR-IR spectrometer.


Thermal analyses. 
Thermogravimetric analyses were performed on a TA Q500 at a 10 °C min−1 heating rate under a nitrogen flow. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was performed on a DSC3 + Mettler Toledo at a scan rate of 20 °C min−1 under a nitrogen atmosphere.


Size exclusion chromatography (SEC). 
The molecular weight distribution was determined by size exclusion chromatography (SEC, Waters). The setup consisted of a pump, a differential refractometer (Waters 2410) and three columns in series (Styragel HR2, HR4 and HR6; with the pore size ranging from 102 to 106 Å). The analysis was performed at 35 °C and THF was used as the solvent at a flow rate of 1 mL min−1. Calibration was relative to polystyrene standards. A series of polystyrene standards in the range of 580–3848000 g mol−1 were used to obtain a universal calibration curve.


Absorption spectroscopy. 
Absorption spectra were recorded on a PerkinElmer Lambda 950 spectrometer.


Cyclic voltammetry (CV). 
Cyclic voltammetry was carried out at a scan rate of 250 mV s−1 on a Princeton Applied Research Parstat 2273 in a 3-electrode single compartment cell with a Pt disc working electrode (Ø = 0.5 mm), a platinum wire counter electrode (Ø = 0.5 mm) and a silver wire pseudoreference electrode.


Water contact angle measurement. 
Water contact angles were measured using an OCA 20 instrument (Dataphysics).

Perovskite film preparation
The perovskite films were deposited from a precursor solution with the composition FAI (1 M), CsI (0.05 M), PbI2 (1.1 M), MABr (0.2 M) and PbBr2 (0.22 M) into a mixed DMF:DMSO solvent (4:1 v/v) following previously reported procedures.37 The stabilized devices were prepared using the same precursor solution, in which D1, D2 and D3 were dissolved (2 mg mL−1). The perovskite solution was spin-coated onto FTO covered glass substrates in a nitrogen-filled glove box following a two-step procedure at 1000 and 6000 rpm for 10 and 20 s, respectively. During the second step, 200 μL of chlorobenzene were poured on the spinning substrate 5 s before the end of the spinning. The substrates were then annealed at 100 °C for 40 min in an argon-filled glove box.
Perovskite film characterization

Grain size analysis was carried out using SPIP software.

Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images were recorded on a Bruker Dimension ICON in a tapping mode.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained on a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα (λ = 1.5418 Å) radiation.

Absorption spectra were recorded on a PerkinElmer Lambda 950 spectrometer.
Device fabrication
Devices were fabricated on clean FTO covered glass substrates (NSG 10). SnO2 compact layer deposition was carried out as reported by Correa-Baena and co-workers.38 Firstly, a 0.05 M solution of SnCl4·5 H2O in isopropanol was spin coated onto clean FTO covered glass substrates at 3000 rpm for 30 s with a ramp of 200 rpm s−1. The layers were then annealed at 180 °C for 1 h. To increase the homogeneity of the films the substrates were then treated by chemical bath deposition. For the solution of the chemical bath, 0.5 g of urea was dissolved in 250 mL of deionized water, followed by the addition of 10 μL of mercaptoacetic acid and 0.5 mL of HCl (37 wt%). Finally, 0.108 mg of SnCl2·H2O was added. The substrates were placed vertically in a glass container filled with the solution and kept in a water bath for 3 h. The temperature was maintained at 70 °C.37 After the end of the process, the substrates were sonicated in deionized water for 2 min, rinsed with ethanol, dried with compressed air and annealed at 180 °C for 1 h. Prior to perovskite deposition, the substrates were cleaned by UV-ozone treatment. After perovskite deposition, the substrates were cooled down for a few minutes and spiro-OMeTAD (0.06 M in chlorobenzene) was spun at 4000 rpm for 20 s. Spiro-OMeTAD was doped with Li-TFSI, TBP and FK209, with their molar ratios to spiro-OMeTAD of 0.5, 3.5 and 0.05, respectively. Finally, 80 nm of a gold top electrode was thermally evaporated under high vacuum through an appropriate shadow mask.
Device characterization

Current–voltage (J–V) characteristics were recorded by applying an external potential bias to the cells while recording the generated photocurrent on a digital source meter (Keithley Model 2401). The settling time was set to 200 ms. The light source was a Solixon A20 solar simulator (Solaronix), calibrated with a Si reference diode and the light intensity was 100 mV cm−2. The aperture area was 0.16 cm2. For stability measurements, the devices were kept at maximum power point (MPP) using Rera software.
To confirm the reproducibility of the stability measurements, preliminary stability tests, recording the stabilized power output maintaining the solar cells at a bias close to their MPP, were carried out (Fig. S15–S17†).

Temperature and humidity tracking during the stability experiments was carried out using a TFA digital data logger for measuring temperature, humidity and pressure.
Results and discussion
Synthesis
The chemical structures of the synthesized novel additives D1–D3 are displayed in Fig. 1.
 Fig. 1  Chemical structures of small molecule D1 and copolymers D2 and D3. 
In order to facilitate charge transport and extraction in the perovskite layer and to guarantee optimal photovoltaic performance, all compounds were obtained from the family of triarylamines, which are one of the most used p-type organic semiconductors.39,40
Molecule D1 contains two triarylamine units attached to a central benzyl ring, which bears two perfluorinated chains, each one containing 13 fluorine substituents. Polymers D2 and D3 are composed of a perfluorinated benzyl unit in combination with two different donor moieties, a triarylamine and a triarylamine extended unit, respectively. Both polymers benefit from the enhanced solubility provided by the introduction of alkyl groups in their structures, making them easier to process. The electron rich methoxy groups in D1 and oxygen-containing fragments in D2 and D3 are expected to enhance the supramolecular interaction between the perovskite and the dopant via hydrogen bonding and passivate the non-coordinating Pb2+.23,26
The procedure for the synthesis of additives D1–D3 is shown in Scheme 1. The intermediates for the synthesis of the additives, 1,412,42,43 and 3,44 were prepared according to the published procedures, while intermediate 4 was newly prepared (see the ESI† for more details). The targeted molecule D1 was obtained as a pale yellow solid, by coupling two molecules of the borylated triarylamine 2 with intermediate 1 through Suzuki cross coupling using Pd(PPh3)4 as the catalyst, sodium bicarbonate as the base and toluene as the solvent.
 Scheme 1  Synthetic route to additives D1–D3. 
The composition and chemical structure of the synthesized compound D1 were confirmed by 1H NMR, 19F NMR, 13C NMR, infrared spectroscopy and mass spectrometry (Fig. 3 and Fig. S1, S2, S5 and S6 of the ESI†).
In the same way, polymers D2 and D3 were synthesized by Pd-catalyzed Suzuki polymerization of the dibrominated monomer 1 with the corresponding diboronic ester monomers 3 and 4, respectively. After extraction of the organic layer and precipitation, polymers D2 and D3 were purified from the residual catalyst and low molecular weight impurities by subsequent Soxhlet extraction with different solvents, yielding D2 and D3 as pale yellowish and green solids, respectively.
The composition and chemical structure of polymers D2 and D3 were confirmed by 1H NMR, 19F NMR and mass spectrometry (Fig. 2 and 3 and Fig. S3, S4 and S7 of the ESI†). In the MALDI-TOF spectra of D2 and D3, the peaks which differ from each other by a value which corresponds to the building blocks of both polymers were clearly visible. As a representative example, the MALDI-TOF spectrum of polymer D2 is shown in Fig. 2, where differences between some peaks which correspond to the building block (C44H31F26NO [M+]: 1083.19) of D2 were found.

Further evidence of the presence of compounds D1–D3 was found by tracking the changes in the 19F NMR spectrum originating from perfluorinated chains, which occur after the coupling of compound 1 with the corresponding triarylamine. Fig. 3 shows the 19F NMR spectrum of compound 1. At room temperature, the spectrum exhibits the usual pattern of an aromatic-bonded C6F13 group, with the appropriate number of 19F resonance signals.45 The signal at −107.75 ppm is attributed to the fluorine atoms closer to the aromatic ring, denoted as a. The rest of the fluorine atoms of compound 1, which are denoted as b–e, are all assigned to the structure of D1, as can be seen in Fig. 3.
After the coupling between compound 1 and triarylamine 2, 3 or 4, the resonance signal a shifts to approximately −103 ppm, as a consequence of the deshielding effect of the new substituent.
The size of the polymers was estimated by SEC in THF with polystyrene standards for calibration. The number average molecular weight (Mn) of D2 is 10231 g mol−1, leading to a degree of polymerization (Xn) of 9. The corresponding weight-average molecular weight (Mw) of D2 is 16144 g mol−1 with a relatively small polydispersity (PDI = Mw/Mn) of 1.58. For D3, Mn and Mw were 10750 g mol−1 and 17600 g mol−1, respectively, with a PDI of 1.64 and an Xn of 8. These values are comparable to those obtained for other triarylamine-based polymers described in the literature.46,47
Thermal properties
Thermogravimetric analysis carried out at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under a nitrogen atmosphere indicated the high thermal stability of molecule D1 and polymers D2 and D3 (Fig. 4).
 Fig. 4  Thermogravimetric heating curves of compounds D1, D2 and D3 (heating rate of 10 °C min−1). 
Additives D1, D2 and D3 showed decomposition temperatures (Td) of 249, 284 and 274 °C, respectively, which are well above the operational conditions of PSCs. All compounds exhibited weight loss before decomposition, which is attributed to the loss of solvent traces.
DSC measurements revealed that polymers D2 and D3 are fully amorphous and show glass transition temperatures (Tg) of 81 °C and 82 °C, respectively (Fig. 5a).
 Fig. 5  (a) Differential scanning calorimetry second heating curves for polymers D2 and D3 (heating rate of 20 °C min−1). (b) Differential scanning calorimetry curves for molecule D1 (heating rate of 20 °C min−1). 
In contrast, molecule D1 showed only a peak corresponding to the melting of the material at 194 °C during the first heating, and no glass transition was detected during heating. During cooling, an exothermic process of crystallization was observed at 153 °C indicating that below that temperature the material is crystalline (Fig. 5b). As expected, all compounds showed excellent thermal stability probably due to the presence of perfluorinated chains in their structure.
Optoelectrochemical properties
The UV-vis absorption of D1, D2 and D3 was recorded in CH2Cl2 (Fig. 6a). As expected, all compounds did not display significant absorption in the visible region. On the other hand, these materials showed strong absorption in the UV region, with the maximum absorption at around 300–330 nm. The extinction coefficient (ε) at the absorption maximum of D1 is around 40000 M−1 cm−1 while those of polymers D2 and D3 are around 20000 and 30000 M−1 cm−1, respectively (Table 1).

From the onset of the absorption edge in the longer wavelength region, the values of the optical band gap (Eg) were estimated to be 3.07 eV for D1 and D2 and 3.02 eV for D3 (Table 1).
The electrochemical properties of molecule D1 and polymers D2 and D3 were studied by CV, measured in a 0.1 M solution of nBu4NPF6 (TBAHFP) in anhydrous CH2Cl2 (Fig. 6b). Their highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level (EHOMO) values were estimated from the onset potential of the first oxidation (EOx1onset) during CV measurements using the ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) redox couple as the internal standard. Therefore, EHOMO values were estimated according to the equation EHOMO (eV) = −4.8 − EOx1onset and the data are listed in Table 1. D1 and D2 exhibit one reversible oxidation wave at EOx11/2 values of 0.34 and 0.51 V vs. Fc/Fc+, respectively, indicating their electrochemical stability. The EOx1onset values at 0.29 and 0.40 V for D1 and D2, respectively, lead to EHOMO levels of −5.09 and −5.20 eV, respectively. The reported EHOMO value for the triple cation perovskite, used in this work, is −5.45 eV,48 suggesting a possible hole transfer from the perovskite to the donor, which would imply that the additives do not impede the charge transport within the perovskite material. Moreover, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels (ELUMO) were estimated from the difference between EHOMO and Eg of the compounds. Thus, with the absorption onset at 3.07 eV for both compounds D1 and D2, the ELUMO values were estimated to be −2.02 and −2.13 eV, respectively.
For polymer D3 two different oxidation waves can be observed, the second one being non-reversible. The strong electron-donating property of polymer D3 compared to polymer D2 is reflected in its lower first oxidation potential. With an EOx1onset value of −0.01 eV, an EHOMO of −4.79 eV is obtained, which in combination with the above calculated Eg leads to an ELUMO value of −1.77 eV. Similar to compounds D1 and D2, polymer D3 exhibits good band alignment between the HOMO of the hole-transporting material (HTM) and the valence band edge of the perovskite, without hindering the transport of charges.
To characterize the hydrophobicity of D1, D2 and D3, water contact angle measurements of the spin-coated films were performed. The contact angles of the water droplet are 106°, 107° and 102° (Fig. S8, ESI†) for D1, D2 and D3, respectively, demonstrating the pronounced hydrophobic nature of the compounds.
Thin-film characterization
To investigate the effect of the additives on the properties of the triple cation perovskite films with the Cs0.05(MA0.17FA0.83)0.95Pb(I0.83Br0.17) composition, they were incorporated into the perovskite layer at a concentration of 2 mg mL−1. The novel additives D1–D3 were added to the perovskite precursor solution and to promote the dissolution of these additives, the mixture was heated to 100 °C for 10 min. The films were fabricated by spin coating the precursor solution onto FTO-covered glass substrates in a glove box filled with argon. The films were then annealed at 100 °C for 45 min.
To confirm the structure of the perovskite films we carried out XRD analysis. Fig. 7a shows the diffractograms of the pristine perovskite and perovskites doped with D1, D2 and D3. All films display the typical pattern for perovskites with the most pronounced peaks at 2Θ = 14.16° and 28.5° arising from the (110) and (220) planes of the perovskite, respectively. The increased peak intensity at 2Θ = 14.16° for the D2-doped perovskite suggests improved crystallinity.49 Due to the slight excess of PbI2 all samples display a small peak at 12.7°.13 This peak, however, decreases slightly in intensity with the addition of the additives, suggesting an improved conversion of the perovskite.
 Fig. 7  (a) X-ray diffractograms of the pristine and doped perovskites deposited on the FTO covered glass. Peaks marked as “P” and “*” correspond to PbI2 and the perovskite, respectively. The perovskite peaks are assigned as follows: 14.16°, 20°, 28.5°, 32°, and 43.3° to the (110), (012), (220), (310) and (330) crystallographic planes of the tetragonal perovskite structure, respectively.50,51 (b) Absorption spectra of the pristine and doped perovskite films. 
The absorption spectra of the pristine and doped films are shown in Fig. 7b. All films display the corresponding absorption of the triple cation perovskite and are practically identical.
To assess the effect of the additives on the hydrophobicity of the perovskite, we performed water contact angle measurements and recorded a contact angle of 56° for the pristine perovskite versus the measured angles of 68°, 62° and 60° for the D1-, D2- and D3-doped perovskite, respectively (Fig. S9, ESI†). These results show that the compounds are embedded in the perovskite film and/or on its surface, modifying the surface of the perovskite layer by their hydrophobic character.
The morphology of the perovskite layers was studied by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Fig. 8a–c show the images obtained for the undoped and D1- and D2-doped perovskite films. The D1 and D2 compounds were included in order to check how the incorporation of a small molecule and the polymeric nature of the compounds, respectively, were affecting the perovskite morphology. The films are composed of perovskite grains, which in the pristine perovskite appear to be clearly faceted with sharp edges and grain boundaries.
 Fig. 8  (a–c) SEM top-view, (d–f) AFM topography, and (g–i) AFM phase micrographs of the undoped, D1- and D2-doped perovskite films, respectively. 
The doped perovskite layers are composed of grains of slightly bigger size and reduced grain boundaries compared to the undoped one. This trend is especially pronounced in the case of the D2-doped perovskite. The difference in shape is also evident from the AFM topography and phase images shown in Fig. 8d–i. As can be seen in Fig. 8g, the undoped perovskite is composed of smaller, cuboid-like grains with pronounced edges, which affect the surface of the film. D1- and D2-doped perovskites, in contrast, have smooth edged and round-shaped flat grains with reduced grain boundaries. To quantify the effect of the additives on the film morphology and grain size we analyzed the SEM images using image processing software in order to obtain the mean area and grain size (Table 2).

The mean grain diameter of the reference perovskite is 160 nm, which is consistent with the previously reported data for this type of perovskite.52
The addition of D1 and D2 in the perovskite layer led to an increase in the mean grain size to 195 nm for the D1-doped perovskite and above 200 nm for the D2-doped perovskite. The increment of the grain size and improved perovskite quality are frequently observed when suitable additives are employed. The reason for this is that in the presence of small quantities of additives, the formation of a disordered gel–sol precursor phase is promoted during the process of crystallization and grain growth, more specifically during the early stage of the spin-coating. This disordered precursor phase slows down the crystallization process, which results in larger grains.22,53
Photovoltaic performances
To investigate the effect of the additives in PSCs, we employed the doped perovskite films as the active layer in planar n–i–p devices. The solar cell architecture of the device using D1 as the additive can be observed in the SEM cross-sectional image displayed in Fig. 9a. Fig. 9b shows the current density–voltage curves of the highest performance PSCs and Table 3 summarizes the photovoltaic characteristics of the resulting devices. Moreover, the statistics for the device parameters are shown in Fig. S10.†

The reference devices showed an average power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 14.1% with the maximum value of 15.9%. Doping the perovskite material with D1 slightly decreases the average PCE, mainly due to the reduced Voc and FF. However, some of the D1-devices deviate from this trend, showing high current and record efficiency, reaching 17.0% (Table 3). The D2-doped PSCs showed Voc comparable with the reference devices while the PCEs were slightly lower. Finally D3-doped perovskite devices have FF and Jsc values similar to those of the reference devices, while the Voc is slightly lower than the reference devices, as in the case of polymer D2. In general, doping the perovskite with additives D1, D2 and D3 slightly affects the device performance, which implies that the semiconductor properties of the perovskite, such as charge transport, are unaffected.
The hysteric behaviour of the devices tends to vary from batch to batch independent of the device type. Frequently, all the devices from the same batch show no hysteresis (Table S1 and Fig. S11–S14, ESI†).
Stability measurements
To evaluate the stability of the solar cells, devices using molecule D1 and the best-performing polymer D2 underwent two different stability tests in air for bare devices without encapsulation. First, we measured the stabilized power output maintaining the solar cells at a bias close to their MPP. The measurement was carried out in air in a solar simulator. As shown in Fig. 10a, the reference device starts degrading gradually from the beginning of the measurement and after 40 min severe degradation issues are observed. This leads to the complete breakdown of the device after 80 min of operation under these conditions. In contrast, the D1-doped device showed very stable power output practically without any decay for about 40 min. Then, the power started to decline slowly and after 80 min of aging in air the device retained 94% of the initial power. The D2-doped device showed a gradual decrease in the output power, which is delayed compared to the reference devices and reached 85% of the initial power after 80 min. The same tendency was found in preliminary stability tests under the same conditions for 5, 20 or 40 minutes (Fig. S15–S17†). This further confirms that the incorporation of the additives into the perovskite layer clearly enhances the stability of the devices.
 Fig. 10  (a) Normalized power measured as a function of time for the reference and doped cells kept at MPP in air; (b) normalized PCE measured for the reference and stabilized device storage in air. During the long aging experiment the temperature was in the range of 22–26 °C and the humidity in the range of 50–67%. 
It is well known that perovskite devices are very sensitive when operating in ambient air and they degrade quickly due to a number of degradation processes related to the effect of oxygen, humidity, heating and chemical reactions of the materials in the solar cell stack.4,20,54–56 Doping the perovskite with the perfluorinated additives modifies the surface, increases the hydrophobicity of the perovskite and provides a protective barrier against oxygen. All these effects lead to retarded degradation when the devices are operating in air. Furthermore, prolonged operation causes heating of the device. In this study, we have continuously recorded the temperature in the cavity of the solar simulator where devices are measured in a prolonged experiment, and we observe that in less than 10 min the temperature of the air in the measuring cavity reaches 46 °C and remains constant (Fig. S18†). This inevitably causes heating of the devices, without taking into account the intrinsic heating of a solar cell due to resistive effects, etc. Therefore, we can hypothesize that the perfluorinated additives retard the degradation of the devices when operating in air at elevated temperatures (higher than the standard measuring conditions) also due to improved thermal stability. This is consistent with previous studies, which report that perfluorinated compounds enhance the thermal stability of the materials.57
The stability of non-encapsulated devices upon storage in air was also tested. During the experiment the temperature and humidity of the air were constantly recorded (Fig. S19†). The normalized PCE as a function of storage time is shown in Fig. 10b. As it can be seen, the PCE of the reference devices dropped to 54% of the initial value after 16 d of storage. D1- and D2-doped devices maintained 86% and 60% of their initial PCE, respectively. This result further demonstrates the stabilizing effect of the novel perfluorinated additives. The weaker stabilization effect of D2 compared to D1 could be explained by the Tg value of polymer D2. In this sense, after perovskite deposition, an annealing process at 100 °C is carried out, which could lead to phase transition of the polymer, which could alter the morphology of the perovskite film.
Conclusions
In this study, we have developed two novel polymers and one small molecule for use as additives in PSCs. The compounds contain large perfluorinated chains with 26 fluorine units, which increase the hydrophobicity of the perovskite when added to the material in a very small quantity. The overall effect of the compounds in PSCs was studied, and it was demonstrated that the compounds stabilize the perovskite devices when operating in ambient air, without sacrificing the efficiency. The stabilizing effect is most likely due to a combined protective action against humidity and oxygen, because of the formation of a protective barrier by the perfluorinated compound. Nevertheless, the stabilization upon heating during operation could also be considered as a possible mechanism of action. All in all, improved molecular design and synthesis of perfluorinated compounds with increased compatibility with the precursor solution and increased Tg would be of great interest in order to achieve the full potential of perfluorinated compounds in PSCs.
