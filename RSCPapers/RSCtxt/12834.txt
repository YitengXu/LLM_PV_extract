    , Accepted 19th November 2018First published on 19th November 2018AbstractInterlayer-expanded MoS2 (E-MoS2) nanosheets with an interlayer spacing of 0.94 nm are demonstrated to show an high photothermal conversion efficiency of ∼62%. More importantly, such biocompatible E-MoS2 nanosheets show highly improved photothermal therapy (PTT) of tumors in vitro and in vivo under near-infrared light irradiation.
As one of the main aims of modern medical technology, achieving the therapy of cancer with a minimal invasion to normal tissue has attracted increasing attention. In particular, the photothermal therapy (PTT) is widely deemed to be one of the promising technologies due to the advantages of minimal invasiveness, high selectivity, and low systemic effects.1–5 Compared with conventional approaches, PTT destroys tumor cells through hyperthermia or thermal ablation based on the conversion of near-infrared (NIR) light energy into heat. As such, the effectiveness of PTT highly depends on the photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE) of biocompatible NIR absorbing agents. Normally, an ideal photothermal conversion agent for PTT needs to exhibit strong optical absorption in the NIR region. So far, various NIR photothermal conversion agents have been developed, such as noble metal nanoparticles, carbon-based nanostructures, and semiconductor nanomaterials.6–8 However, the effectiveness of their PTT is still not satisfactory for practical applications due to their limited intake amounts in tumors and low PCE.9 Therefore, numerous researchers around the world are still concentrating on developing novel agents with high PCE to improve the therapeutic efficacy of PTT.
Since a good photothermal effect of 2D MoS2 nanosheets was reported by Chou et al.,10 the potential application of layered MoS2 as a photothermal conversion agent for cancer therapy has attracted tremendous attention due to the advantages of low cost, remarkable biocompatibility, and good stability. Up to now, most of the studies have been focused on the construction of multifunctional platforms based on modifying MoS2 nanostructures for synergistic treatments.11–14 Only a few works are involved in improving the PCE of MoS2 by tuning the morphologies and surface compositions of nanosheets.15–18 To the best of our knowledge, the maximum PCE value of MoS2 reported so far is still less than 50%. Accordingly, it is still highly desired to further improve the PCE of MoS2 for practical applications.
Herein, we report interlayer-expanded MoS2 (E-MoS2) nanosheets with a high PCE value of ∼62%. It is found that a much larger interlayer spacing of 0.94 nm results in greatly improved utilization of NIR light and high PCE. Coupled with good biocompatibility, such E-MoS2 nanosheets are demonstrated to be promising photothermal agents for efficient PTT of tumors in vitro and in vivo.
As is well known, hexagonal MoS2 crystalizes in a well-defined layered structure connected by interlayer van der Waals force.19 Tuning the intrinsic interlayer distance of MoS2 is an effective way for adjusting its physicochemical properties.20–22 For example, theoretical simulations showed that interlayer expansion is practicable to improve the reaction kinetics and thermodynamics of MoS2 by decreasing the diffusion energy barrier and improving interlayer conductivity.23–25 Accordingly, huge efforts have been devoted towards expanding the interlayer distance of MoS2 for broadening its applications in many fields, such as lithium-ion batteries, hydrogen evolution, and catalysis energy storage.26,27 However, no attention is yet paid to the photothermal conversion of MoS2 with expanded interlayer spacings for the application of biomedicine. Herein, we demonstrate that interlayer-expanded MoS2 (E-MoS2) nanosheets show a much higher PCE under NIR light irradiation.
E-MoS2 nanosheets were prepared by a modified solvothermal decomposition of thiomolybdate in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) in the presence of ammonium ions according to a previous report.28 The typical X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the E-MoS2 nanosheets in Fig. 1a shows that all diffraction peaks can be well indexed to hexagonal MoS2 (JCPDS card no. 37-1492) except for the obvious shift of the (002) peak to a lower angle. The as-calculated d-spacing value of ∼0.94 nm is much larger than that of the normal MoS2 nanosheets with a value of ∼0.62 nm, indicating that the E-MoS2 nanosheets have a much enlarged interlayer distance (inset in Fig. 1a). The low-magnified scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image shows that the E-MoS2 nanosheets exhibit a flower-like morphology with a size of hundreds of nanometers (Fig. 1b). The enlarged SEM image reveals that the E-MoS2 nanosheets are composed of highly corrugated nanosheets with an average thickness of ∼5 nm (Fig. 1c). The corresponding energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) pattern shows the presence of Mo (32.4 at%), S (64.8 at%), and N (2.8 at%) in the resultant MoS2 (Fig. 1d). The N may come from the little NH4+ embedded between layers of the E-MoS2 nanosheets. The intercalation of ammonium results in a widened interlayer spacing of the resultant E-MoS2 nanosheets, agreeing well with a previous report.29 The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image shows that the resultant MoS2 flower with an average size of ∼200 nm are composed of ultrathin corrugated nanosheets with a thickness of ∼5 nm (Fig. 1e). The corresponding selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern shows the presence of two concentric rings, which can be indexed to the diffractions from (001) and (100) facets, suggesting the polycrystalline structure of the E-MoS2 nanosheets. The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image reveals that the average interlayer spacing value was about 0.93 nm (Fig. 1f), which is consistent with the result of XRD. The combined characterization studies of XRD, SAED, and HRTEM confirm that the E-MoS2 nanosheets have enlarged interlayer distance. In contrast, a smaller layer distance of ∼0.62 nm was obviously observed from the HRTEM image of the normal MoS2 (Fig. S1, see the ESI†).

The insets in (a) and (e) show the crystal structure and SAED pattern of the layer-expanded MoS2 nanosheets (E-MoS2). 
The E-MoS2 nanosheets can be well dispersed in water after ultrasound, as revealed by the linear increase of the absorption intensity as the concentration increased (Fig. S2, see the ESI†). The absorbance spectrum of the E-MoS2 nanosheets dispersed in water shows strong absorption ranging from 400 to 1000 nm in Fig. 2a. Notably, an obvious absorption peak at around 960 nm in the NIR range can be observed for the E-MoS2 nanosheets as compared to that of the normal MoS2 nanosheets. This may be attributed to the localized surface plasmon resonance of the intervalence charge-transfer transition between Mo species and ammonium of the E-MoS2 nanosheets.30 Besides, the multiple reflections of NIR light between the expanded interlayer of the E-MoS2 nanosheets could also result in improved absorption. The strong absorption in the NIR range is very favourable for photothermal conversion and PTT application.9 Afterwards, a heating experiment was carried out to study the PCE of the E-MoS2 nanosheets. The infrared thermal images obtained using an IR thermal camera (Fig. 2b) clearly show that the temperature of the water containing E-MoS2 nanosheets increases much more rapidly and reaches a higher value than that of the aqueous solution containing normal MoS2 nanosheets after NIR irradiation for 5 min at 100 μg mL−1 at a power of 1 W cm−2. As can be seen from Fig. 2c, the temperature of the solution containing E-MoS2 nanosheets increases 32.8 °C after NIR irradiation for 20 min, while that of the solution with normal MoS2 increases 25.6 °C. In contrast, the temperature of pure water without MoS2 only increases about 3.0 °C. After turning off the NIR light, the temperatures of all dispersions gradually decrease to room temperature, confirming that the remarkable thermal effect comes from the photothermal conversion of E-MoS2. For a better comparison, we calculated the PCE values of E-MoS2 and MoS2 using the same method according to previous reports.17,31 Based on the profiles shown in Fig. 2c and d, the PCE value of the E-MoS2 nanosheets is 62%, which is much higher than that of the normal MoS2 nanosheets (45%) and other newly developed 2D nanomaterials, as shown in Fig. S3 and Table S1 (see the ESI†). Furthermore, five laser on/off cycles exhibited nearly the same curves, agreeing with the NIR absorption spectral results (Fig. S4 and S5, see the ESI†), indicating that the E-MoS2 nanosheets show both good photothermal and structural stability.

The much better photothermal conversion capability of the E-MoS2 nanosheets than the normal MoS2 nanosheets could be attributed to the following factors. On one hand, the better accessibility to water originated from the larger interlayer spacing, and the presence of ammonium ions between layers results in enhanced colloidal stability of the E-MoS2 nanosheets. This is very helpful for improving the NIR absorption and photothermal conversion capability, leading to more efficient transformation of NIR energy into heat.15 On the other hand, the enlarged interlayer distance could induce a remarkable cavity-mirror effect that results in a higher light utilization of E-MoS2 nanosheets due to the repeated light reflections and absorptions inside the E-MoS2 layers.9,22 Besides, the interlayer expansion can improve mass diffusion and heat storage and transport,27,29 thus showing a high photothermal conversion performance. Overall, the expanded layer spacing endows the E-MoS2 nanosheets with higher photothermal conversion efficiency than normal MoS2.
Afterwards, we evaluated the biocompatibility of the E-MoS2 nanosheets by hemolytic and cell tests. The haemolytic index is a useful indicator to evaluate their biocompatibility. As shown in Fig. 3a, the hemolysis indices of E-MoS2 nanosheets with different concentration are less than 5%, indicating their good blood compatibility. Further, we probed and compared the possible cytotoxic effects of E-MoS2 nanosheets on HepG2 cells at different concentrations with or without NIR light irradiation. As shown in Fig. 3c, the E-MoS2 nanosheets show no obvious cytotoxicity as the cell viability is still higher than 80% even when incubating them at a concentration of 200 μg mL−1 without NIR irradiation. The normal MoS2 nanosheets also show a similar cell viability to those previously reported,10,32–35 suggesting that both E-MoS2 and MoS2 nanosheets show good cytocompatibility. In contrast, upon NIR light irradiation for 5 min at an out power of 1.0 W cm−2, a prominent cytotoxicity is detected for HepG2 cells after culturing with the E-MoS2 nanosheets for 24 h. Furthermore, the E-MoS2 nanosheets show a higher cytotoxicity upon NIR light irradiation than MoS2 nanosheets at the same concentration. For example, only 23% of HepG2 cells were alive in the presence of E-MoS2 nanosheets, while this value of the MoS2 group is about 37% at 200 μg mL−1. This indicates the better photothermal therapeutic effect of E-MoS2 than that of MoS2 nanosheets, agreeing well with the above results of the photothermal experiments in pure water. More indicatively, the cell viability is dependent on the dose of E-MoS2 nanosheets under NIR light irradiation. In order to further confirm the good photothermal effect, the cells cultured with or without the E-MoS2 nanosheets after NIR irradiation were stained with calcein-AM and propidium iodide (PI) to label live and dead cells, respectively. As revealed in Fig. 3b, most of the cells incubated with E-MoS2 nanosheets under NIR irradiation were stained with red fluorescence, indicating that the E-MoS2 nanosheets could effectively assist the conversion of NIR energy into heat to destroy the cells. The good biocompatibility and outstanding photothermal performance of the E-MoS2 nanosheets satisfy the prerequisites for use as efficient photothermal transducing agents for PTT applications. Afterwards, we evaluated the in vivo photothermal therapeutic effects of the E-MoS2 nanosheets in comparison with MoS2 nanosheets. As revealed in Fig. 4a, the temperature changes of the tumor region after an intravenous injection with the MoS2 and E-MoS2 nanosheets were recorded via an IR thermal camera. In the control group, the temperature around the tumor region shows no significant change with a slight increase up to 43.1 °C. In comparison, a rapid temperature increase up to 59.1 °C was observed in the mice treated with the E-MoS2 nanosheets after NIR irradiation for 5 min. This value is much higher than that of the MoS2 group with a value of 54.6 °C under the same conditions. Such a high temperature can effectively kill the tumor cells because it is higher than the threshold value inducing tumor cell death and coagulative necrosis.10,36 Furthermore, such a high temperature almost covers the whole tumor, indicating that the E-MoS2 nanosheets show excellent photothermal performance in vivo.

Based on the above intriguing results, we further evaluated the photothermal therapeutic effect of the E-MoS2 nanosheets on tumor-bearing H22 mice for PTT applications. When the tumor volume reached 100 mm3, the E-MoS2 nanosheets were injected intravenously at 40 mg kg−1. The mice were treated under NIR laser irradiation at 1.0 W cm−2 for 5 min after injection for 6 h. During the entire PTT period, the tumor size evolution was recorded using a caliper. As shown in Fig. 4c, compared with the control group, the tumor size in the control plus NIR group increases rapidly, indicating that NIR laser irradiation without the photothermal agent cannot restrain the tumor growth. In contrast, the tumor size in the group with MoS2 nanosheets decreases gradually, suggesting that MoS2 nanosheets accumulated in the tumor site are helpful for absorbing the laser energy and converting it into heat and thus inhibit the tumor growth. More predominately, the tumor region of the mice with E-MoS2 nanosheets became a scab on the third day after treatment, and gradually disappeared after 11 days. These results are consistent with the above tumor inhibition rate results. Such superior PTT efficiency of the E-MoS2 nanosheets is attributed to the combined effects of the high accumulation of the E-MoS2 nanosheets in the tumor via the enhanced permeability and retention effect and highly efficient photothermal transduction properties. Moreover, the body weight in the group with the E-MoS2 nanosheets shows no significant difference after 11 days (Fig. 4b). No obvious lesion was found in the major organs of mice treated with E-MoS2 nanosheets (Fig. S6, see the ESI†). These results demonstrate that the biocompatible E-MoS2 nanosheets show high PTT efficiency towards tumor ablation under NIR laser illumination.
In summary, we demonstrated the use of interlayer-expanded MoS2 (E-MoS2) nanosheets as efficient photothermal transducing agents for photothermal therapy (PTT). The ultrathin structure and enlarged interlayer spaces (∼0.94 nm) endow the as-obtained E-MoS2 nanosheets with a high PCE value of ∼62% due to the greatly improved utilization of NIR light. The resultant E-MoS2 nanosheets also show good biocompatibility as well as a remarkable photothermal therapeutic effect. More significantly, the E-MoS2 nanosheets were demonstrated to be highly effective for PTT in both cancer cells and tumor-bearing mice. Both the in vitro and in vivo results show that E-MoS2 nanosheets can be used as promising photothermal conversion agents for tumor treatment through PTT. This work opens a new avenue to improve the PCE of 2D layered nanomaterials by expanding the interlayer distance.
