These have a general applicability but have been predominantly used for energy transformation from heat to stored chemical free energy in the form of hydrogen, with a view to a future hydrogen economy. Thermal efficiency is a key parameter in such a transformation, and the study presents a simple methodology for the determination of the limiting efficiency available, for the purpose of decision making in further cycle implementation and to develop consistency with other heat-to-work processes. The method is applied to 21 previously reported cycles, for which no such efficiency information has been reported, and discusses the features of the cycles which give rise to high and low efficiencies.IntroductionThe present revival in interest in thermochemical cycles (TC's) as a means of producing hydrogen reflects the increasing expectation of the contribution which ‘CO2-free’ sources of process heat will make to a hydrogen economy. This includes, in particular, heat from solar furnaces and high temperature nuclear reactors, where heat will be available at temperatures in the range of 1200–1700 K. Thermochemical cycles offer the potential of providing the cleanest chemical route to hydrogen by the creation of a completely closed set of reactions with input and output material streams being only water and H2/O2 gases respectively.Recent re-assessments of the broad range of possible cycles first proposed in the 1980s has generated a number of publications which present flowsheet improvements for existing processes as well as additional cycles for consideration. In all of these, the thermodynamically calculated overall process efficiency is a key parameter. Unfortunately, there remains considerable variability in the way in which this parameter is defined. Variations in process flowsheets and a lack of consistency in the way in which process efficiency is calculated can lead to significant uncertainties over the relative values of different cycles and makes comparison difficult. This suggests that adoption of a more consistent approach would be useful in order to enable a strategic view to be taken of the potential contribution of TC's to future energy scenarios.The value of a Carnot efficiency for determining the limiting efficiency of a thermal process producing work is taken for granted in power engineering and a similar approach for TC's would aid in the assessment of the maximum, or ideal, efficiency achievable, assuming perfect implementation. Any subsequent flowsheet variations will mean a performance drop from this ideal value. The present work sets out a basis for representing such ideal efficiencies, based on a step by step examination of each stage of the cycle in terms of its free energy change and heat requirements. The maximum thermodynamically allowed internal heat transfer is used to minimise external heat input and an overall efficiency is calculated based on the residual free energies and heat requirements, including the recombination of hydrogen and oxygen.In this way, the thermochemical cycle is viewed as a mechanism for converting heat into work, as represented by the combination of stored chemical free energy and any additional work which the intermediate reactions can produce. The examination of the maximum theoretical efficiency of cycles in this way provides a useful starting point for any comparison between cycles and also allows identification of the strengths and weaknesses within cycles.Carnot efficiency equivalenceFor the simplest cycle, this consists of an endothermic thermal decomposition at high temperature (T1) combined with a work recovery step at low temperature (T0).  For the reactions from left to right, assuming to a first approximation that enthalpy and entropy changes are independent of temperature, the overall Gibbs free energy change for reactants and products at their reference condition, is ΔGoverall = (ΔG1

						T1)ΔS(1)i.e. the cycle will provide work output (ΔGoverall = −ve) if ΔS for the decomposition is a +ve quantity. In this case ΔG at the higher temperature is numerically lower, becoming zero at the decomposition temperature.The heat balance for a simple AB decomposition can be usefully represented on a pinch diagram as shown in Fig. 1. Here it assumed that the specific heats for AB heating and A + B cooling are independent of temperature. Fig. 1  Heating and cooling behaviour for simple AB decomposition. The possibility for internal heat balancing is represented by two possible product cooling lines, showing both a shortfall in cooling heat with respect to the heating line and an excess of cooling heat leading to heat rejection. When standard states are used to represent the free energy and enthalpy changes, the work efficiency for the cycle is given by: (2)where Q1 is the heat input at decomposition and ‘heat mismatch’ represents the heat transfer shortfall between A + B cooling and AB heating.In the special case where the specific heat functions of products and reactants are identical, i.e.Cp(A + B,T) = Cp(AB,T), then both the entropy changes and enthalpy changes are independent of temperature and exact heat matching results.In this case, ΔHo0 = ΔHo1 and ΔSo0 = ΔSo1 and the efficiency then becomes: (3)For this special case, heat is added only at the upper temperature T1, and such simple cycles can provide the Carnot efficiency for converting heat into chemical free energy.Fig. 2 shows the variation of the parameters of eqn 3 with temperature for the hypothetical case of a system with ΔH = 100 kJ mol−1 and ΔS = 100 J (mol K)−1.

					ΔG1. As a result of the entropy and enthalpy independence with temperature, the cycle will provide the Carnot efficiency throughout the temperature range. At the decomposition temperature (1000 K), ΔG1 = 0 and only heat is required to effect the conversion of 1 mol of reactants to products at the standard state.Several decompositions of simple molecules approximate quite closely to this condition as shown for some examples in Table 1. In these cases, T0 = 298 K and Q is the greater of ΔHo0 and ΔHo1.

This is equivalent to equating the total work produced as the algebraic sum of the standard free energy changes for each reaction, excluding any separation work. Due to the closed nature of the system, species have a dual identity as both a reactant and product, and therefore changing a species' initial or final pressure will produce additional work terms which cancel due to their having opposite signs, resulting in (4)This also applies to the generation of hydrogen at higher pressures, which will require an additional amount of work, which will become available again on recombination with oxygen.For the simple cycle depicted above, the operation of the decomposition at a temperature where ΔGo1 = 0, is particularly useful since no external work is required to take the reactants to products at the standard state defined. As part of the objective of comparing the ability of a number of thermochemical cycles to convert heat into work, an initial approach has been taken to establish the maximum efficiency possible for these. Since the underlying interest is in the use of heat to effect chemical changes, for reactions involving +ve values for both ΔH and ΔS, an operating temperature is chosen which results in ΔGo = 0, thus limiting any additional work required to bring the products to standard pressure. In some cases, the reaction temperature chosen in this way would exceed those of practical process conditions, and therefore an upper limit operating temperature of 1700 K has been imposed for all cycles. For those endothermic reactions with −ve values for ΔS, the quoted literature value for the operating temperature has been chosen. Literature values for the operating temperature have also been chosen for any exothermic reactions in a cycle.The main features of the analysis are described as follows:1. Each cycle is closed and includes the recombination of the H2 and O2 produced to liquid water at the standard state (1 bar) and at 298 K.2. Reactions involving only heat inputs are carried out under equilibrium conditions and temperatures are chosen to satisfy ΔGo = 0, when possible, subject to a limit temperature of 1700 K.3. Heat balancing is carried out between all of the heating and cooling branches of the process, with the constraint that the heat transfer temperature difference ΔT is greater than or equal to zero.4. Enthalpy changes are calculated using the HSC 5.1 chemistry package.1 Enthalpy and entropy values for some species have been updated in the database where necessary from published sources.5. Efficiency is calculated through a combination of the work terms arising within the cycle and the total heat added.The work components of the cycle are the Gibbs free energy changes for each of the fundamental steps required to complete the cycle, and are taken as:(a) Free energy work available from recombination, at the standard state and 298 K, of H2/½O2 produced by the cycle (ΔGo298(H2/O2). This is taken as −237 kJ (mol H2)−1.(b) Free energy work available from certain reactions within the set at the standard state, characterised by −ve ΔGo values, ΔGo(−)(c) Free energy work consumed by certain reactions within the set at the standard state, characterised by +ve ΔGo values, ΔGo(+)(d) Free energy work associated with the separation of reaction products. This is calculated as the negative of the mixing free energy (5)where ni and xi are the number of moles and mole fraction of species i in the mixture respectively. This is a +ve quantity, consistent with the sign of the other work terms.In representing an efficiency (η) for the cycle, all free energy components providing output work, ΔGo(−) and ΔGo298(H2/O2), and consuming input work, ΔGo(+) and ΔGsep, are considered equivalent. The efficiency thus becomes defined by: (6)It is noted that the above definition of efficiency differs from those often used in the thermochemical cycle literature where the HHV of hydrogen is frequently used in the numerator and any work capability of some reactions (ΔGo(−)) is ignored. In some cases eqn 6 may be a less generous definition, although it is believed that it provides consistency for comparisons with the normal calculation of a Carnot efficiency.The representation of a cycle by a series of elementary steps is demonstrated for the case of the US Chlorine cycle,2 which involves the following three reactions:(1)Cl2(g) + H2O(g) → 2HCl(g) + ½O2(g)T = 850 KΔHo = 58.8 kJ mol−1ΔGo = 0 kJ mol−1 (2)2CuCl(s) + 2HCl(g) → 2CuCl2(s) + H2(g)T = 473 KΔHo = 24.9 kJ mol−1ΔGo = 118.1 kJ mol−1 (3)2CuCl2(s) → 2CuCl(l) + Cl2(g)T = 850 KΔHo = 185.5 kJ mol−1ΔGo = 0The elementary steps required to evaluate a limiting efficiency are shown in Fig. 3. Fig. 3  US Chlorine cycle for hydrogen production. Reaction (2) has a negative value for ΔS and therefore does not provide the possibility of equilibrium at the standard state for reactant and products, resulting in a positive ΔG value in the temperature range of interest.Table 2. summarises the individual steps representing the operation of the cycle. To and T1 define the starting and finishing temperatures of each step, ΔGo represents the standard Gibbs free energy change for the reactions and any work required to separate components for a further reaction step, and Q± is the heat change involved with the step (+ve when heat is added). Separation work terms are not included when reaction products exist in different phases. All of the thermochemical cycles considered are dealt with in the same way, i.e. heating, reaction, phase change and cooling.

For an efficiency calculation, it is necessary to know the overall heat input requirement and this is evaluated on the basis of the maximum possible heat transfer from the cooling side to the heating side of the process. This is most easily calculated using a pinch diagram for each of the cycles. These are constructed for the limiting case of a heat transfer temperature difference ΔT = 0 degrees, and refer to the production of 1 mol of H2. The pinch diagram for the US Chlorine cycle corresponding to Table 2 is shown in Fig. 4. Fig. 4  Pinch diagram for US Chlorine cycle (excluding H2/O2 recombination). Results and discussionA number of preferred thermochemical cycles, aimed at hydrogen generation, were identified by Brown et al3 on the basis of a range of performance measures, and these cycles have since been the focus of attention for workers in the field. Efficiency was excluded from such measures due to a lack of published data, and this is now addressed using the framework described above for most of the cycles originally selected.The operating conditions and thermodynamic parameters at the standard state for each reaction considered are collected together in Table 3.

The pinch diagram for each of these enables the minimum heat input and heat rejection to be determined.The representation of the cycle efficiencies is concerned specifically with the ability of cycles to produce work in the form of chemical free energy from a heat source. The principal component of the free energy produced is the H2/O2 recombination energy, which however, carries the same importance as other ΔGo(−) and ΔGo(+) terms in eqn 6. The efficiency therefore represents that of the cycle as a whole, and the calculated values can only be used to represent maximum ‘hydrogen production efficiencies’ when the additional ΔG terms (+ve and −ve) are coupled with one another, through choice of process conditions, or with the hydrogen generation process. The equivalence of such ΔG terms with that of the ΔGo298(H2/O2) term ensures that when such coupling is achieved, the calculated maximum efficiency value for the cycle can be used to represent the efficiency for hydrogen production. One such example of coupling would be to operate ΔGo(−) reactions at high product partial pressures and ΔGo(+) reactions, involving the same gaseous species, at high reactant partial pressure.The examination of the simple cycle of Fig. 1 indicates that good matching of heating and cooling, combined with overall heat addition at the maximum temperature will maximise the cycle efficiency.For an ideal cycle this is also associated with the minimum heat rejection but may involve additional work input, which acts to reduce the heat requirement, thus having little effect on the efficiency. Real cycles with multiple reactions include several phase changes, as products undergo the necessary temperature transitions to their next reaction. Maintaining efficiency for these requires that such steps permit heat transfer from the cooling to the heating side. Where process conditions exclude this possibility, large heat rejection and efficiency losses can result.Heat rejection can also result from −ve entropy changes for one or more reaction steps and, while this may be matched by a heat absorption transition, thus benefiting the system heat balancing, such a heat rejection is associated with the input of work to the system. Such ΔGo(+) terms reduce the magnitude of the numerator in the efficiency estimation and are a primary factor in lowering the efficiency for some of the cycles presented. Heat rejection due to phase changes, however, are associated with equilibrium processes for which ΔG = 0 and their effect on efficiency depends only on the extent to which the heating curve can absorb the rejected heat.Table 4 presents the calculated efficiencies for the cycles of Table 3 as well as the aggregated heat input, output and work input terms.

Heat rejection is the unavoidable expelled heat from the system including that from H2/O2 recombination to complete the cycle. The work input is the algebraic sum of the ΔGo(+), ΔGo(−) and ΔGsep terms. This excludes the main work output term of the cycle (i.e.
				ΔGo298(H2/O2)) and provides an indication of (a) the extent to which the nett work output of the cycle arises from the other reactions and (b) the need for external work input to the cycle. In principle, when this latter term is +ve, a proportion of the available hydrogen free energy should be recycled and coupled to the system reactions.Table 4 orders the cycles in terms of maximum efficiency, and the underlying reasons for high or low efficiency provide some insight into the necessary attributes of cycles for design purposes.Examination of the top group of cycles (1–6) indicates that heat rejection is around 1/3 of the nett heat input. The higher the effective temperatures at which heat is input is achieved, the greater will be the efficiency which can finally be achieved, and for the top two cycles, when the maximum heat balancing has been applied, this is in the range 1400–1573 K and 1000–1450 K. For cycles 3–6 these range from 1200–1300 K down to 600–1000 K. For cycles 1–4 there is also some nett work produced in addition to the H2/O2 recombination work, indicating that some useful work is produced from the higher heat inputs associated with these cycles. For cycles 5 and 6 there is a nett work input, but a corresponding reduction in heat input, indicating that the input work is contributing to enthalpy increase within the system, rather than heat rejection.The low efficiencies for the bottom group (16–21) can be rationalised in a similar way. The nett heat input range for cycle 16 is lower at 440–950 K and for cycles 17–21 the range is 850–1100 K. This latter range suggests the possibility of good efficiencies, however, for these cycles, large work inputs reduce the overall work outputs of the cycles, and these are associated with correspondingly large heat rejection stages. These can be identified with one or more unfavourable reactions, with large, −ve entropy changes. In the worst case for cycle 21, the overall work output is −ve, including H2/O2 recombination work, resulting in zero efficiency. This can be traced to the K2O decomposition and K/KOH reactions, where the equilibrium lies strongly to the left.The above approach has a number of features which are useful in making comparisons among thermochemical cycles and with other heat–work processes. Some of these include:• an evaluation, without the use of process flowsheeting, of the maximum or ideal thermal efficiency which a cycle can provide.• an indication of the relative contributions of the hydrogen and non-hydrogen related work terms to the overall efficiency. This is particularly relevant when cycles are being viewed as production routes for hydrogen.• the provision of a starting point for process optimisation, identifying the main geometrical needs for heat transfer. This becomes important in specifying system design and layout to enable the prescribed heat transfer.• assessment of the relative efficiencies of heat–electricity cycles and thermochemical cycles for use with hybrid cycles. This provides useful information on the contribution which the electrical conversion step makes to overall thermochemical cycle efficiency.• the basis for improvement of existing cycles through chemicals selection and better positioning of isothermal heat processes.Whilst the procedure described sets out to determine the maximum efficiencies available, it does not deal with the practical difficulties and new challenges in realising these.Examination of Table 3 for the highest efficiency cycles indicates that some of this derives from ΔG(−) terms, and work must therefore be extracted from these to realise the efficiency indicated.In some cases this may be set directly against ΔG(+) terms, e.g. through the operation pressure for a common gas species, or by means of an established electrochemical pathway for electricity generation, which can then be coupled to hydrogen generation.In other cases, no clear work production pathway or coupling route is evident, an example being the solid reaction of CuBr2–CaO in Cycle 1.Fuel cells and a new range of membrane technologies provide new opportunities in these areas e.g. H2–O2 fuel cells for electrical input to hybrid cycles and reverse concentration cells for electrochemical pumping and separation, and therefore new fuel cell combinations and ion transport media may eventually provide implementation routes for those cycles involving ‘difficult’ reactions. A number of practical design features also limit achievable efficiencies,12–14 examples being:• the need for finite approach temperatures in heat transfer equipment (in contrast to a ΔT = 0 condition)• the overall thermal efficiency arising from electrical pumping to raise product pressures. This may involve thermal to electrical efficiencies of 40% and pump mechanical efficiencies of 70%.• large energy losses arising from separations, an example being the use of phosphoric acid to break the HI–H2O azeotrope in cycle 10.• the use of excess solvents to improve reaction conversions. The use of solvation energy can improve product yield but at the expense of subsequent separation energy.ConclusionThe aim of the analysis has been to provide a method which yields the best achievable efficiency, as a basis for decision making on the value of further study.In addition, in view of the importance of the thermal efficiency parameter in judging the value of heat–work processes, the procedure for thermochemical cycles has sought to define their efficiency in such a way that their limiting efficiency can tend to the Carnot value in the same way as for other thermal processes. This consistency is particularly important when comparisons are made with other heat utilisation processes, such as electricity generation by different routes, and overcomes definitions involving the higher and lower heating values for hydrogen (hhv, lhv) such as the following:   where ηel is the thermal to electrical conversion efficiency for electricity generation, assuming that work input terms can be achieved using an electrochemical process.This simple, but useful approach may encourage others to review some of the many other cycles which have been identified for hydrogen production, from a limiting efficiency perspective, and re-evaluate their feasibility.ReferencesHSC Chemistry v 5.1, Outokumpu Research, Finland,  2002 .L.
