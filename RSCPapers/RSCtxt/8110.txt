    , Accepted 22nd May 2013First published on 22nd May 2013AbstractSymmetrical and unsymmetrical dithiocarbamato pyridine solvated and non-solvated complexes of indium(III) with the general formula [In(S2CNRR′)3]·n(py) [where py = pyridine; R,R′ = Cy, n = 2 (1); R,R′ = iPr, n = 1.5 (2); NRR′ = Pip, n = 0.5 (3) and R = Bz, R′ = Me, n = 0 (4)] have been synthesized. The compositions, structures and properties of these complexes have been studied by means of microanalysis, IR and 1H-NMR spectroscopy, X-ray single crystal and thermogravimetric (TG/DTG) analyses. The applicability of these complexes as single source precursors (SSPs) for the deposition of β-In2S3 thin films on fluorine-doped SnO2 (FTO) coated conducting glass substrates by aerosol-assisted chemical vapour deposition (AACVD) at temperatures of 300, 350 and 400 °C is studied. All films have been characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX) for the detection of phase and stoichiometry of the deposit. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) studies reveal that precursors (1)–(4), irrespective of different metal ligand design, generate comparable morphologies of β-In2S3 thin films at different temperatures. Direct band gap energies of 2.2 eV have been estimated from the UV-vis spectroscopy for the β-In2S3 films fabricated from precursors (1) and (4). The photoelectrochemical (PEC) properties of β-In2S3 were confirmed by recording the current–voltage plots under light and dark conditions. The plots showed anodic photocurrent densities of 1.25 and 0.65 mA cm−2 at 0.23 V vs. Ag/AgCl for the β-In2S3 films made at 400 and 350 °C from the precursors (1) and (4), respectively. The photoelectrochemical performance indicates that the newly synthesised precursors are highly useful in fabricating β-In2S3 electrodes for solar energy harvesting and optoelectronic application.
Introduction
Semiconductors with suitable band gaps and band edges are key to the development of efficient light harvesting applications such as solar cells and solar water splitting.1,2 The β-polymorph of indium sulphide (β-In2S3) is known for its optoelectronic and photoelectrochemical properties and is a promising candidate for many useful applications due to its stability, moderate band gap and photoconductive behaviour.3 β-Indium sulphide (Eg = 2.0–2.2 eV),4 having a defect spinel structure, displays excellent properties of high photosensitivity and photoconductivity,5 stable chemical composition and low toxicity.6 Thus, it is widely applied for displays,7 as a photocatalyst for dye degradation,8 for water splitting6b and for solar cells.9,10 Moreover, β-In2S3 solar cell devices exhibit a high 16.4% power conversion efficiency,11,12 which is comparable to CdS because of their equivalent band gaps and has been considered as a substitute for the highly toxic CdS.13
Much effort has been expended to produce β-In2S3 films and powders with a variety of structures and morphologies. These methods include chemical bath deposition,14,15 sonochemical,16 hydrothermal,17,18 solvothermal,19 solution phase synthesis,20 thermal evaporation,21 chemical spray,22 solvent reduction route,23 electrodeposition24 and metal–organic chemical vapour deposition (MOCVD).25 However, increasing applications of semiconducting materials in optoelectronic and photovoltaic devices in the form of thin films have driven researcher's interest in CVD routes. The demand for CVD routes to a variety of materials has, in turn, generated interest in the design of single source precursors (SSP).26 Historically, a variety of SSP have been investigated including dialkylindium alkanethiolate,27 alkylindium bis-thiolate, tris(dialkyldithiocarbamates),28,29 dialkylmonodithiocarbamate,30 tris(dialkylmonothiocarbamte),31 and alkyl xanthate32 for the deposition of different phases of indium sulphide on a variety of substrates through CVD based techniques. However, there are restrictions imposed by the precursors on the use of this method. These issues directly affect thin film properties such as deposited phase, degree of crystallinity, crystallographic orientation, composition, morphology and possibly the structure of the deposited film. These properties are highly desirable for the fabrication of device quality films.33 By developing precursors specifically for aerosol assisted chemical vapour deposition (AACVD),34 the volatility and thermal sensitivity restrictions can be reduced and as a result a larger range of precursors and films can be investigated.35 By carefully monitoring AACVD deposition conditions such as solution concentration, solvent, nature of the carrier gas, carrier gas flow rate, deposition time and substrate temperature, high quality nanostructured thin films can be produced that can be employed in a range of applications such as photovoltaic, gas sensors, thermoelectric, fuel cells and catalysts.36
In continuation of our efforts on the exploration of metal dithiocarbamate/dithiocarbonate pyridine adducts,37,38 we have devoted our attention to the syntheses of SSPs tris(dialkyldithiocarbamato)indium(III), [In(S2CNRR′)3]·n(py) [where py = pyridine; R,R′ = Cy, n = 2 (1); R,R′ = iPr, n = 1.5 (2); NRR′ = Pip, n = 0.5 (3) and R = Me, R′ = Bz, n = 0 (4)] for the deposition of β-In2S3 films by AACVD technique. The thin films properties have been examined by PXRD, SEM, EDX and UV-vis spectroscopy, for their crystallinity, phase identification, surface morphology, stoichiometry and optical band energies, respectively. Furthermore, the photoactivities of the deposited β-In2S3 films were observed by means of photoelectrochemical (PEC) measurements and the results confirmed that these SSPs are suited to obtain better performing thin films of β-In2S3 for various optoelectronic applications.
Experimental
Preparation and characterization of complexes
All preparations were carried out at room temperature. All materials were obtained commercially and used as received. The dithiocarbamate ligands were prepared according to published procedures.39
The elemental analysis was performed using a Perkin Elmer CHNS/O Analyzer series II 2400. Infrared spectra were recorded with a Perkin Elmer Spectrum 400 FT-IR/FT-FIR spectrometer (4000–400 cm−1). The TGA measurements were carried out on a METTLER TOLEDO TGA/SDTA 851e Thermogravimetric Analyzer at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under a constant flow of nitrogen at a rate of 50 mL min−1.

Deposition of thin films by AACVD
β-In2S3 thin films were synthesised from the precursors [In(S2CNCy2)3]·2py (1), [In(S2CN(iPr)2)3]·1.5py (2), [In(S2CPip)3]·0.5py (3) and [In(S2CNBzMe)3] (4) were deposited on FTO (1 × 2 cm2) glass substrates (TEC 15, 12–14 Ω per square) by using a self-designed ultrasonic AACVD method. The glass substrate was washed ultrasonically with distilled water, acetone and finally with ethyl alcohol before use. In a typical deposition experiment, 0.1 g of each of the precursors was dissolved in 12 mL of tetrahydrofuran and the mixture was added to a round-bottomed flask connected to a deposition assembly. Argon at a flow rate of 120 mL min−1 was used as the carrier gas and the flow rate was controlled by an L1X linear flow meter. Substrate slides were placed inside the reactor tube and then heated up to the desired temperature before deposition from (1)–(4). The aerosols of the precursor solution were formed by keeping the round-bottomed flask in a water bath above the piezoelectric modulator of an ultrasonic humidifier. The generated aerosol droplets of the precursor were transferred into the hot wall zone of the reactor by the carrier gas. The reactor was placed in a tube furnace. The exhaust from the reactor was vented directly into the extraction system of the fume hood where the deposition had taken place. At the end of the deposition, the aerosol line was closed and pure argon was allowed to flow over the thin films to cool them to 40 °C before the characterization.
Surface characterization of thin films
Film morphology and composition were determined by a field-emission gun scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, FEI Quanta 400) equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer EDX (INCA Energy 200 (Oxford Inst.)) operated at an accelerating voltage of 20 kV and a working distance of 9.2 mm. The type of phase and the crystallinity of the deposited films were determined using a PANanalytical, X'Pert HighScore diffractometer with primary monochromatic high intensity Cu-Kα(λ = 1.54184 Å) radiation. The data were collected by scanning from 5° to 90° in a step size of 0.026° operated at 40 kV and 40 mA to cover all possible diffraction peaks of the deposited material.
Optical and photoelectrochemical characterization
The optical absorbance of thin films was measured with a Lambda 35 Perkin-Elmer UV-vis spectrophotometer. The data were registered from 350 to 1000 nm using the FTO glass substrate as a reference. The photoelectrochemical (PEC) properties of β-In2S3 films were measured using the standard three electrodes electrochemical cell fitted with a quartz window. An Ag/AgCl electrode and Pt were employed as the reference and counter electrodes, respectively. An aqueous Na2SO4 (0.01 M) and Na2S (0.10 M) electrolyte was used to measure the PEC properties of β-In2S3 electrodes.42 Steady-state current–voltage measurements of the cells were carried out using a potentiostat (Eco Chemie micro-Autolab type III), while the cells were illuminated by an AM 1.5 Class A solar simulator (Solar Light 16S-300 solar simulator), at 100 mW cm−2 light intensity, calibrated by a silicon pyranometer (Solar Light Co., PMA2144 Class II). The effective area of the electrodes was 1 cm2.
Results and discussion
The indium dithiocarbamates with general formula [In(S2CNRR′)3]·n(py) [where py = pyridine; R,R′ = Cy, n = 2 (1); R,R′ = iPr, n = 1.5 (2); NRR′ = Pip, n = 0.5 (3) and R = Bz, R′ = Me, n = 0 (4)] are conveniently prepared via metathetical reaction of the indium trichloride and sodium dithiocarbamate in methanol–pyridine solutions as shown in chemical reaction (1). Our approach in developing SSPs differs from that of previously used methods in the synthesis of indium [In(S2CNR)3] complexes, in that we used a Lewis base (pyridine) as a solvent for the crystallization of complexes (1)–(4). The dithiocarbamates with Lewis bases are a class of precursor compounds with versatile properties that include: air stability, ease of synthesis at room temperature, enhanced volatility and facile decomposition at relatively low temperatures. However, in the present case, pyridine did not coordinate with the metal centre but exists as solvate molecules in the crystal lattices (1), (2) and (3). (1)
The synthesized complexes were characterized by microanalysis, IR, NMR, TGA and single crystal X-ray techniques. These complexes are produced in high yield and are stable in air and moisture, and highly soluble in common organic solvents such as THF, chloroform and pyridine. This makes them promising precursors for application in the deposition of indium sulphide thin films by AACVD. The CHN microanalysis found for complexes (1), (2), (3) and (4) agrees with the stoichiometry of the complex as calculated from the crystal data.
The 1H-NMR studies of complexes (1), (3) and (4) reveal the usual splitting patterns for the corresponding R groups, however, an unusual splitting behaviour has been detected in the 1H-NMR spectra of complex (2) where the isopropyl (CH(CH3)2) group displays three broad signals. Two equally intense broad singlets appearing at 3.95 and 5.10 ppm are assigned to the methine protons of (NCH(CH3)2), originating from the different positions (syn or anti) with respect to the dithiocarbamate group. The doublet signal of unequal intensities appearing at 1.48 and 1.68 ppm has been assigned to the methyl protons of the isopropyl group and has been interpreted in terms of coordination and barrier rotation about C–N, which makes the nitrogen substituents magnetically non-equivalent.43
In the IR spectra ν(C–N) stretching vibrations for complexes (1)–(4) were detected in the range of 1471–1491 cm−1. This fact implies that the dialkyldithiocarbamate is coordinated to the metal as a bidentate ligand and indicates the partial double bond character in the CN bond.43b,44
Crystal structures of (1)–(4)
The four tris-dithiocarbamate complexes have similar geometric features but the structures differ in the number of pyridine solvate molecules. The In–S distances of the bidentate dithiocarbamate ligands fall within a narrow range, as do the C–S distances, indicating full delocalization. Furthermore, the CN distances are short, as is typical for these ligands.44 To illustrate these similarities, the average complex geometry is given in Table 2, together with the average deviations from the mean.

Structure of [In(S2CNCy2)3]·2py (1)
The crystal structure of [In(S2CNCy2)3]·2py (1) is shown in Fig. 1. The complex (1) has non-crystallographic three-fold symmetry as viewed down the plane of C1/C14/C27 and without inclusion of the cyclohexyl conformations. All the cyclohexyl rings are connected equatorially to their parent nitrogen atoms. The two molecules of pyridine were disordered over two orientations. The two sets of atoms comprising the pyridine molecules were refined as rigid idealized hexagonal groups with occupancies that were initially refined and then fixed at {0.50/0.50} and {0.30/0.70} for the sets involving N4 and N5, respectively. With two pyridine molecules removed from the refinement, the solvent accessible void is 1256 Å3. In the structure, one pyridine occupies a channel perpendicular to the bc plane. The second pyridine is sandwiched between cyclohexyl rings in an alternating fashion.

Structure of [In(S2CN(iPr)2)3]·1.5py (2)
In the structure of [In(S2CN(iPr)2)3]·1.5py (2), shown in Fig. 2, there is one pyridine solvent molecule in a general position and a second pyridine at half-occupancy disordered about a centre of inversion. There is also small orientational disorder (83:17) in one of the isopropyl groups (not shown). With pyridine molecules removed from the refinement, the accessible solvent volume is 438 Å3. In the structure the 1.5 pyridine solvate molecules are encaged by isopropyl groups.

Structure of [In(S2CPip)3]·0.5py (3)
In this complex the dithiocarbamate has a smaller footprint, as the NRR′ has been replaced by piperidine as shown in Fig. 3. There is one pyridine site, which is both rotationally disordered and disordered with respect to a crystallographic center of symmetry. With pyridine removed from the refinement, the solvent accessible void is 167 Å3. In the structure the pyridine molecules occupy a channel perpendicular to the bc plane.

Structure of [In(S2CNBzMe)3] (4)
Complex (4), shown in Fig. 4, has no solvate molecules in the structure. There is a non-classical hydrogen bond between S4 and a methyl H atom of a neighbouring molecule. The S⋯H distance is 2.81 Å. In this solvate-free structure the packing index is 68.4%, and there is no solvent accessible void.

The average In–S bond lengths 2.590[4], 2.594[9], 2.592[11] and 2.594[11] Å observed in complexes (1)–(4), respectively, are similar to those reported for analogues of these compounds. The average C–S distances are close to 1.72 Å indicating delocalization in the CS2 skeleton. The average CN bond distances, which are approximately 1.33 Å, are significantly shorter than the normal single bond, suggesting considerable double bond character, as expected for metal dithiocarbamates.44
Thermal decomposition studies of complexes (1)–(4)
The efficacy of complexes (1)–(4) as SSPs for the deposition of indium sulphide thin films was probed by thermogravimetric experiments and their TG and DTG curves are presented in Fig. 5 and S.Fig. 5a–d (ESI†). The TG profiles of pyridine solvated (1), (2) and (3) exhibit two-steps while the non-solvated precursor (4) shows a one-step pyrolysis towards the end product. The initial weight loss at temperature range of 55–115 °C from (1) and (2) and at 45–110 °C for (3) is attributed to the loss of pyridine molecules. The observed weight losses of 11.60 (1), 15.50 (2) and 6.84% (3) show some agreement with the calculated values of 11.37, 15.54 and 6.21% for the loss of 1.5 and 0.5 molecules of pyridine from (1), (2) and (3), respectively. The TG experiment on solvent free (4) did not show any weight loss in the temperature range of 45–120 °C confirming that the initial weight loss in (1), (2) and (3) is essentially due to the loss of pyridine. The TG and DTG data reveal that the precursors (1)–(4) decompose in the temperature range 230–400 °C in a single step to produce stable residue masses of 15.19, 20.09, 23.85 and 25.40%, respectively. These mass losses agree well with the theoretical values of 15.62, 21.36, 25.64 and 23.15% for the formation of β-In2S3 from (1)–(4). The DTG curves of the pyridine solvated complexes (1)–(3) indicate two maxima of heat intake. The first heat intake occurs at 94 °C for (1) and (3) and at 84 °C for (2), indicating the removal of pyridine, while the second maxima appeared at 340 °C for (1), 290 °C for (2) and 330 °C for (3). The DTG curve of non-solvated (4) shows maximum heat intake at 340 °C and confirms its one step decomposition (S.Fig. 5a–d, ESI†). The observed final residues upon heating to 600 °C did not undergo any change in their weight suggesting that complexes (1)–(4) decompose quantitatively to furnish β-In2S3 as a stable end product.

Phase and crystalline structure identification of indium sulphide thin films
Indium sulphide thin films were deposited from precursors (1)–(4) on a FTO substrate at temperatures of 300, 350 and 400 °C by AACVD. The crystalline patterns obtained for the indium sulphide thin films as a function of substrate temperature were investigated by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and are displayed in Fig. 6. Interestingly, similar PXRD patterns were observed for all indium sulphide thin films prepared from precursors (1)–(4) that agree well with the standard Inorganic Crystal Structure Database ICSD = [98-002-3844]45 file (S.Fig. 6, ESI†) in terms of their 2θ, d-spacing and reflection planes and identify the deposited product as the β-In2S3 crystallizing in the tetragonal crystal system with a = b = 7.632, c = 32.36 Å. The peaks indexed by (*) correspond to the SnO2 layer of the FTO substrate. The intensity of the peaks is significantly strong, which indicates that the product is well-crystallized in all cases. All the spectra are dominated by diffraction peak (123) located at 2θ = 27.7° (d = 3.21 Å) and there is no evidence of significant grain orientation. However, the diffraction peak intensities displayed a remarkable increase with the rise in deposition temperature, which is probably due to improved crystallinity of the films when the substrate temperature was raised from 350 to 400 °C. These PXRD peak patterns show no characteristic peaks arising from possible impurities such as InS, In2SO3 and other phases of In2S3. This clearly indicates that precursors (1)–(4) are capable of producing pure crystalline tetragonal phase β-In2S3 at 350 and 400 °C.
 Fig. 6  PXRD patterns of β-In2S3 deposited from precursor [In(S2CNCy2)3]·2py (1), [In(S2CN(iPr)2)3]·1.5py (2), [In(S2CPip)3]·0.5py (3) and [In(S2CNBzMe)3] (4) at 350 (black) and 400 °C (red) on a FTO glass substrate. All of the diffraction peaks can be matched with ICSD = [98-002-3844]. 
Previous studies have shown that the deposition temperature, indium sulphur contents and molecular design of precursors are major parameters in determining the nature of the deposited indium sulphide phase i.e. InS, In6S7, α-In2S3 and β-In2S3.46 For example the compound [InnBu(SiPr)2] yielded tetragonal β-In2S3 at 400 °C, however, the sulphur deficient phase, In6S7, was also grown with the rise in temperature to 450 °C.27b This is because of the dissociation of the thiolate moiety from the precursor, resulting in deposition of In6S7 at a high temperature of 450 °C. In a comparative growth study of two different alkyl thiolate precursors [InMe2(StBu)]2 and [IntBu2(StBu)]2, the methyl derivative produced a mixture of In6S7 and In2S3 while the butyl analogue generated only the tetragonal InS phase.27a This behaviour was explained in terms of the stronger In–C bond in the methyl substituted complex that results in fragmentation of the precursor upon decomposition to give a mixture of In6S7 and In2S3 phases, whereas the tert-butyl derivative exhibits a clean ligand loss to furnish InS. The bis-thiolate precursor [InMe(StBu)2]2 generates an amorphous phase at 400 °C that needs further annealing to yield crystalline β-In2S3.27a
When indium tris-(dialkyldithiocarbamates) complexes were investigated as SSPs by LPCVD technique, their unsymmetrical forms successfully yielded cubic α-In2S3 thin films at 500 °C while the symmetrical derivative proved not to be volatile and no deposition occurred.28 A comparison of the films deposited by LPCVD at 350 °C using two different indium tris(monothiocarbamates) [In(SOCNEt2)3] and [In(SOCNiPr2)3] precursors, reveals that the former complex produced thin films with poor morphology while the diisopropyl derivative deposited good quality β-In2S3 thin films.31 The foregoing discussion summarizes that steric demand and coordinative flexibility of the ligand have a great influence on the aggregation, stability and volatility of the resulting complexes and therefore the choice of appropriate deposition technique is required for the growth of good quality thin films.
Surface characterization of β-In2S3 thin films
The morphology and architectures of β-In2S3 thin films fabricated from precursors (1)–(4) were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM).
SEM images of the thin films prepared using THF solutions of the precursors (1)–(4) on FTO glass substrates at temperatures 300, 350 and 400 °C are presented in Fig. 7. These indicate that the shape and design of β-In2S3 films vary with the rise in substrate temperature. Thin films grown from (1)–(4) at 300 °C were too thin and were not detected by PXRD and SEM micrographs. Fig. 7(a, d, g and j) show indistinguishable designs and crystallites stacked together with poor coverage of substrate. These observations suggest that none of the four precursors is completely decomposed and the slow growth rate of the films at 300 °C is due to low deposition temperature. This observation is also confirmed by TGA where decomposition of all the complexes occurs in the temperature range 340–375 °C. With the increase in deposition temperature to 350 °C, thin film growth rates from all (1)–(4) become better and the substrate surface is fully covered with different morphologies of β-In2S3i.e. (1) granular crystallites with clear boundaries, Fig. 7b, (2) lumps, Fig. 7e, (3) agglomerates of particles along with some buds, Fig. 7h, and (4) multi-shaped (triangular, square and hexagonal based pyramidal) interconnected crystallites, Fig. 7k. Further increasing the deposition temperature to 400 °C, (1) showed a similar kind of morphology, Fig. 7c, as was observed for (4) at 350 °C. However, (2), (3) and (4) developed large, small and flake like architectures, Fig. 7f,i,l, respectively.

All the indium sulphide films produced from precursors (1)–(4) adhered well to the FTO substrate and passed the scotch tape test. Visual inspection of the films revealed that dark yellow films were made at 300 and 350 °C while their colour turned to orange red at 400 °C.
The film surface composition was determined by energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX). Table 3 and S.Fig. 7, ESI† show that the In/S atomic ratio existing in all the films prepared from precursors (1)–(4) are close to the expected ratio of 1:1.5, indicating the formation of β-In2S3.

Optical properties and band gap of thin films
The optical band gap energies of β-In2S3 thin films fabricated from precursor (1) at 400 °C and (4) at 350 °C were studied by spectrophotometry and are presented in Fig. 8. The UV-vis spectra of these films recorded in the wavelength range between 350–1000 nm indicate significant absorption in the ultraviolet and the early visible regions, Fig. 8a.
 Fig. 8  (a) UV-vis spectra of β-In2S3 thin films deposited using precursor (1) at 400 °C and (4) at 350 °C on the FTO substrate. (b) Shows the direct band gaps of 2.2 eV for β-In2S3 films. 
The optical band gap (Eg) values were obtained from eqn (2) below: (αhν) = A(hν − Eg)n….(2)where α is absorption coefficient, A is a constant, hν the photon energy and n is an exponent which is equal to 1/2 or 2 for direct or indirect transition, respectively. The optical band gaps were calculated from the absorbance data by plotting (αhν)2vs. photonic energy (hν) and extrapolating the linear part of the curve on the energy axis and were found to be 2.2 eV (Fig. 8b). The thickness of the β-In2S3 films used for the optical experiments was estimated by profilometer to be 395 and 358 nm, respectively. Our band gap value is in agreement with the band gap energies of β-In2S3 thin films made through other synthetic routes and with the bulk material.47 The band structure indicates that charge transfer upon photo excitation occurs from the sulphur 3p orbital to the indium 5p empty orbital.
Photoelectrochemical properties
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) characteristics obtained from the electrical and optical studies of an electrode–electrolyte interface are an important tool for identifying the stability of the deposited films for electrochemical photovoltaic applications. The PEC performance of such deposited electrodes can be improved by using desirable precursors, composition, concentration, deposition temperature, deposition time etc. The PEC characteristics of as-prepared β-In2S3 films from precursors (1) and (4) by AACVD at 400 and 350 °C under the alternative dark and illumination conditions are shown in Fig. 9 and 10, respectively. The plots indicated that under illumination a β-In2S3 electrode exhibits an anodic photocurrent, which increases with increasing anodic bias.48 The rectified I–V plot (Fig. 9) of β-In2S3 from precursor (1) at 400 °C shows 1.25 mA cm−2 of photocurrent density at 0.23 V vs. Ag/AgCl and rises steeply up to 1.5 mA cm−2 as the applied voltage further increased without reaching the saturation point. The β-In2S3 films prepared using precursor (1) at 400 °C displayed higher photocurrent response compared to the other depositions, which is attributed to the good interconnections and uniform structure of the multi-shaped β-In2S3 crystallites in the film. As is evident from the SEM images and XRD patterns, the film deposited using precursor (1) at 400 °C is superior to films deposited at 300 and 350 °C. For better performance of an electrode, the structural uniformity and crystallinity are highly important in acquiring a better charge transport. Films fabricated from precursor (1) at 400 °C have structural uniformity and crystallinity resulting in better PEC performance. As is evident from the SEM images, the electrodes fully covered with sharp-edged crystallites of β-In2S3 films deposited at 400 °C from precursor (1) benefit in terms of improved charge transfer by avoiding electron-hole recombination. The I–V plots confirmed that precursors (1) and (4) are suited for the fabrication of good β-In2S3 thin films by AACVD technique. The deposited β-In2S3 films display a reasonable photosensitivity, which indicates their potential for application in optoelectronic devices.

Conclusions
Pyridine solvated (1)–(3) and non-solvated (4) tris(N,N-dialkyldithiocarbamato)indium(III) complexes, with the general formula [In(S2CNRR′)3]·n(py), have been prepared, characterized and implemented as AACVD precursors for the deposition of β-In2S3 thin films. Despite of the different nature of the alkyl groups, metal ligand designs and deposition temperatures, each of the complexes exhibits only one phase and stoichiometry equivalent to β-In2S3 as confirmed by PXRD, SEM and EDX analyses of the thin films. These studies have discovered that regardless of the attachment of different ligands to In, comparable morphologies of β-In2S3 at different temperatures were obtained. UV-vis measurements of the β-In2S3 films showed band gap energies (Eg) of 2.2 eV, making them suitable for photocatalytic activities. The β-In2S3 films deposited from precursor (1) at 400 °C exhibited a photocurrent density of 1.25 mA cm−2vs. Ag/AgCl with an applied bias of 0.23 V. The results confirmed that the newly synthesised single source precursors are suitable to obtain promising photoactive β-In2S3 thin films by AACVD method for application in solar cells and other optoelectronic devices.
