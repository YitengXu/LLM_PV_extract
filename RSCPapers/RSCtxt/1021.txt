    , Accepted 4th March 2020First published on 4th March 2020AbstractLow-power near-infrared (NIR)-to-visible (vis) photon upconversion (UC) systems are in demand for biomedical, photovoltaic and photocatalytic applications; however, the practical utilization is still hampered by low UC efficiency. Aiming to identify efficiency-limiting factors, particularly in metallophthalocyanine-sensitized rubrene systems operational in the NIR-vis range, we thoroughly assessed subsequent energy transfer steps in the TTA-mediated UC scheme. A key limiting factor in the optimized UC systems was found to be rubrene's low statistical probability (f = 15.5 ± 3%) to obtain a singlet from two triplets via TTA. The f estimated under the dominance of TTA attained by continuous-wave excitation, i.e. the regime frequently encountered (or desired) in practical applications, was determined to be 4 times lower as compared to that obtained under femtosecond pulsed-laser excitation conditions. The results also demonstrate that the benefit of achieving larger emitter concentrations by introducing solubility increasing alkyl groups into the emitter in anticipation of enhanced triplet energy transfer cannot outcompete the severely reduced statistical probability factor (f = 5.3 ± 1%) of t-butyl-substituted rubrene. The maximum UC quantum yield (ΦUC = 5.6 ± 1.2%) estimated and verified by two independent methods in the optimized Pd-phthalocyanine–rubrene system is among the largest reported for NIR-to-vis UC systems absorbing at >730 nm. ΦUC is defined here as the number of UC photons emitted per number of absorbed ones, implying a theoretical limit of 50% for TTA-mediated UC.
Introduction
Increasing demand for organic systems capable of incoherent photon upconversion (UC), i.e. conversion from lower to higher energies at low excitation intensities, is stimulated by a growing variety of applications such as photocatalysis,1,2 bioimaging,3 stress sensing,4 night vision,5 memory devices,6 photovoltaics,7,8 targeted drug delivery9 and others.10 In these typically bicomponent systems, composed of sensitizer and emitter species, long-lived triplet-states of emitters are utilized to produce delayed UC emission from the singlet state that is blue-shifted as compared to the absorbed light. The higher energy UC emission from an emitter emerges through a process called triplet–triplet annihilation (TTA), also referred to as triplet fusion. In the TTA-UC process sensitizer species serve as light absorbers, which subsequently generate triplets via intersystem crossing (ISC) and finally transfer triplet energy (TET) to an emitter species. Importantly, TTA-UC can be accomplished at low light conditions close to those of sunlight (∼mW cm−2).7,8
While a great number of efficient UC systems with a quantum yield (ΦUC) of up to ∼30% have been demonstrated in the visible (vis) spectral region,11–16 only several molecular systems have been shown to produce near-infrared-(NIR)-to-vis UC with ΦUC above 2%.17–21 It seems that finding proper materials capable of operating with high UC efficiencies under NIR excitation is a big challenge. The surge of interest for NIR-to-vis UC is highly motivated by applications in biomedicine, photocatalysis and solar cells. While the first two applications benefit from profound penetration of IR light,1 utilization of the TTA-UC phenomenon in solar cells offers the potential to overcome the Shockley–Queisser limit for solar conversion efficiency.8,22 Since most photovoltaic devices suffer from low efficiencies at NIR-IR wavelengths, conversion of NIR-IR to the vis wavelengths that are well utilized by devices is foreseen to enhance their performance.
Various classes of materials capable of NIR light absorption and triplet sensitization were reported, among which perovskites,23 supermolecular chromophores,24 BODIPY derivatives25 or inorganic semiconductor quantum dots19,26 are of fundamental interest. However, the lack of a transparency region for UC emission and the consequent huge reabsorption losses in these sensitizers are usually ignored. This severely limits the UC efficiency of such systems and thus hampers their practical applications.27 To minimize these losses, sensitizers bearing large conjugated macrocycles such as porphyrins28,29 or phthalocyanines30–32 providing a decent transparency window between the Soret and Q absorption bands are frequently utilized. Moreover, metallophthalocyanines have an advantage that their Q band expresses a large molar extinction coefficient (ε ∼ 105 M−1 cm−1), which can be tuned in the region of 650–800 nm for efficient harvesting of NIR photons.30
No less important is the correct choice of emitter with the triplet state sufficiently low in energy to accept triplet excitons from a NIR sensitizer. In this regard, one of the most widely used emitters for NIR-to-vis upconversion is rubrene7,19,21,28–30,32–37 featuring a low triplet energy (1.04–1.14 eV) and close to unity fluorescence quantum yield (ΦFL) at yellow wavelengths.38,39 Regrettably, the majority of porphyrin- or phthalocyanine-sensitized rubrene UC systems reported in the literature so far are limited to ΦUC < 4%,28–30,32,35,36,40,41 although generally regardless of the emitter chosen the maximum limit of ΦUC is 50%.13
Another crucial parameter affecting the choice of an emitter and having a direct impact on ΦUC is the statistical probability factor (f).41 The factor describes the probability for the triplet pair in an emitter to form one singlet via TTA. Relying purely on spin statistics and taking into account that the triplet encounter complex can be of singlet, triplet or quintet multiplicity with a corresponding statistically weighted formation probability of 1:3:5, f should not exceed 1/9 (or 11.1%) as there will be only one complex dissociating to the S1 state.42 However, many reports proved this limit to be incorrect considering that triplet and quintet complexes may not necessarily quench to the ground state, but instead, depending on the relative position of energy levels, relax back into triplets. Thus, f values exceeding 11.1%, e.g. 50% for diphenylanthracene43 or even 100% for perylene,44 were demonstrated. Rubrene was also reported to exhibit a rather large f (= 33%),40 although much smaller than the previous two emitters, thereby implying greater efficiency losses associated with the statistical probability factor.
Hence, aiming to complement this area of research with more understanding of the performance limitations of NIR-to-vis UC systems, particularly metallophthalocyanine–rubrene systems, we thoroughly investigated the losses for each subsequent energy transfer/conversion step in the TTA-mediated UC scheme. To assess losses associated with the statistical probability to generate a singlet via TTA, we utilized a continuous-wave (CW) NIR excitation regime, which is particularly relevant for applications such as photocatalysis or photovoltaics. Although similar studies on rubrene-based UC systems have been previously conducted by the Schmidt group,40,41 the different excitation regime (femtosecond pulses) employed therein could have some influence on the TTA-UC properties evaluated. The UC systems studied in this work consisted of structurally-modified Pd- and Pt-phthalocyanine sensitizers (PdPc and PtPc) and rubrene-based emitters designed to express efficient NIR-to-vis (730 nm to 560 nm) upconversion. Taking into account that most of the phthalocyanines are rigid, planar, poorly soluble and therefore susceptible to aggregation,45 phenoxy and butoxy groups were intentionally introduced to compensate for these shortcomings. Likewise, the investigated rubrene emitter was modified with t-butyl side moieties to alleviate solubility problems at high concentrations. Various combinations of sensitizer–emitter pairs as a function of their concentrations were explored to achieve optimized UC performance and to determine the limiting factors. Two independent methods were employed for evaluation of the UC quantum yield (ΦUC) of the studied systems to ensure the reliability of the obtained results. The obtained difference in the statistical factor of obtaining a singlet via a TTA event of the unaltered and the t-butyl-modified rubrene emitter was found to play a decisive role in the performance of the studied NIR-to-vis UC systems.
Results and discussion
Photophysical properties
The structures of the studied metallophthalocyanine-based NIR sensitizers and rubrene-based emitters are displayed in Chart 1. Their synthesis and identification are provided in the ESI.† Aside from the different metal atom, the palladium(II) 1,4,8,11,15,18,22,25-octabutoxy-2,3,9,10,16,17,23,24-octaphenoxyphthalocyanine (PdPc) and platinum(II) 1,4,8,11,15,18,22,25-octabutoxy-2,3,9,10,16,17,23,24-octaphenoxyphthalocyanine (PtPc) sensitizers have an identical structure, thus enabling the determination of the influence of the central heavy metal on the photosensitization ability of the compounds. The introduced butoxy and phenoxy twisted peripheral groups mainly served as solubility increasing and steric hindrance groups for suppressing detrimental concentration effects. Similarly, to prevent aggregation of the rubrene emitter (Rub) at the highest concentrations, it was functionalized with t-butyl moieties to result in the tBRub compound. The Rub and tBRub emitters, possessing otherwise identical structures, were compared in terms of energy transfer efficiencies and probabilities of singlet generation via TTA.

Fig. 1 shows absorption, fluorescence and phosphorescence spectra of the sensitizers PdPc and PtPc in dilute toluene solutions. Their main photophysical properties are listed in Table 1. As expected both sensitizers exhibited strong absorption in the NIR range with a molar extinction coefficient ε ≈ (1.9–2.5) × 105 M−1 cm−1 of the Q bands at 720 nm and 709 nm for PdPc and PtPc, respectively. Due to the smaller Stokes shift of PdPc, its FL band was centered at 750 nm as compared to the more redshifted FL of PtPc peaking at 785 nm. The metallophthalocyanine-based sensitizers exhibited very low fluorescence quantum yields (ΦSFL) <1% (Table 1). Taking into account Φ0FL = 88% measured by us for the metal-free but otherwise identical phthalocyanine, the drastic quenching of ΦFL obtained with the introduction of Pd and Pt was attributed to the rapid ISC to the triplet manifold induced by the enhanced spin–orbit coupling due to the heavy metal atom. Thus, the ISC yield deduced for our sensitizers PdPc and PtPc as ΦISC = 1 − ΦSFL/Φ0FL was found to exceed 99% in agreement with other reports on metallophthalocyanines.32,35 The triplet energies (T1) of PdPc and PtPc were found to be 1.12 eV and 1.18 eV, respectively, as determined from the phosphorescence (Ph) maxima (Fig. 1 and Table 1). The lower or at least similar T1 of rubrene (1.04–1.14 eV)38,39 thereby ensured proper energy level alignment with respect to PdPc and PtPc for the triplet sensitization of the Rub and tBRub emitters. Relying on the singlet and triplet energies determined, a TTA-mediated UC scheme with the relevant energy transfer/conversion processes for the Pd- and Pt-phthalocyanine-sensitized rubrene systems was drawn (Scheme 1).

 Scheme 1  TTA-UC energy scheme for the PdPc- and PtPc-sensitized Rub (or tBRub) systems. λEXC – excitation wavelength, ISC – intersystem crossing, TET – triplet energy transfer, TTA – triplet–triplet annihilation, UC – upconversion. 
Importantly, the Rub fluorescence centered at ∼560 nm, as shown in Fig. 1, resides in the absorption window of both phthalocyanine sensitizers, implying low reabsorption losses for UC emission in the Rub:PdPc or Rub:PtPc systems. The same is also valid for tBRub, since the added non-conjugated t-butyl moieties have an insignificant impact on the absorption and FL properties of the unsubstituted Rub emitter (ESI,† Fig. S18). Additionally, both emitters were determined to have nearly 100% ΦFL in dilute solution.

t-Butyl-substituted rubrene tBRub was designed to increase the solubility of the conventional Rub emitter for employing higher emitter concentrations in the UC solution. Since TTA is a bimolecular process, which requires an encounter of two emitter triplets, a higher emitter concentration is anticipated to facilitate TTA, thereby also improving the TTA-UC performance. However, one must be aware of the self-absorption effect in the concentrated emitter solutions as a result of the relatively small Stokes shift (∼120 meV) observed for the rubrene-based emitters (ESI,† Fig. S18).
UC efficiency measurements
To optimize the UC performance of the investigated phthalocyanine–rubrene systems, their UC properties were assessed by varying the concentrations of the constituting species. Fig. 2a shows UC emission spectra of one of the studied couples, Rub:PdPc, on a semi-log scale measured at different Rub concentrations and a fixed PdPc concentration. The measurements were accomplished by selectively exciting the PdPc sensitizer at the Q band. Bright yellow UC emission occurring in the Rub:PdPc solution under CW excitation with a NIR laser diode (730 nm) was nicely seen by the naked eye (Fig. 2b). Similar vivid UC emission was also observed under NIR LED excitation. The emitter concentration was varied over two orders of magnitude from the lowest 0.1 mM up to the highest 18 mM, which corresponded to the solubility limit of Rub at room temperature. The UC emission peaking at ∼560 nm corresponded to the FL spectrum of Rub (ESI,† Fig. S18), whereas the fluorescence at ∼760 nm emanated from PdPc. Note that the reference spectrum obtained at 0 mM of Rub evidences no UC while only PdPc associated fluorescence, proving that both species, i.e. the sensitizer and the emitter, are necessary for observation of UC. The constant intensity of the PdPc band despite the significantly changing UC signal can be explained by the fixed concentration of sensitizer used in the Rub:PdPc solutions and also by the fact that Rub has no absorption in the NIR range.
 Fig. 2  (a) UC emission spectra of Rub:PdPc solution in toluene at different Rub concentrations (indicated) and fixed PdPc (15 μM) concentration under CW excitation at 730 nm. The inset depicts UC peak intensity vs.Rub concentration. (b) Pictures of UC emission in Rub:PdPc solution under NIR excitation (no filter used). 
Although a wide range of employed concentrations of phthalocyanine-based sensitizers (10–800 μM) was reported to produce UC,30,34,35,40 in the current systems it was fixed in the low concentration range at 15 μM. Such a low concentration was found to result in reduced energy back-transfer from the emitter to the sensitizer and deliver optimal UC performance (ESI,† Fig. S19). Note that because of the detrimental energy back-transfer, a low sensitizer concentration was also favoured in solid UC systems.27
As it is evident from Fig. 2a and the inset, increasing the Rub concentration from 0.1 mM to 18 mM boosted the UC emission by more than three orders of magnitude. The continuously increasing UC intensity accompanied by the unchanged FL of the sensitizer indicated a persistently improving UC yield up to the highest possible emitter concentrations. The similar behavior also observed for the other of the two UC systems studied, Rub:PtPc and tBRub:PdPc, can be rationalized in terms of enhanced TET as well as increased probability for the triplet encounter and TTA. On the other hand, the increasing Rub concentration also caused an undesirable redshift of the UC band due to the self-absorption effect (discussed below), which could in turn adversely affect the UC efficiency.
To highlight the importance of emitter self-absorption in the concentrated UC solution we employed an excitation–detection configuration in which the excitation region was moved away from the detector so as to continuously increase the optical path length, Δx, for the escaping photons (the inset of Fig. 3). Obviously, the short-wavelength slope of the UC spectra experienced enhanced distortion with increasing Δx as compared to the spectra at Δx = 0, resulting in reduced UC intensity (Fig. 3). Meanwhile, the spectrum at Δx = 0 resembled that of the non-reabsorbed FL spectrum of isolated Rub (ESI,† Fig. S18). The demonstrated issue of the self-absorption clearly indicated that special care must be taken in quantifying ΦUC of the concentrated emitter solutions.
 Fig. 3  UC emission spectra of Rub (18 mM):PdPc (15 μM) in toluene solution measured at different distances (Δx) between the excitation region and detector under CW excitation at 730 nm. The excitation–detection configuration is shown in the inset. 
Since generally ΦUC of a particular emitter–sensitizer system is described by the yields of the intermediate energy transfer/conversion steps, namely the ISC yield of the sensitizer, the TET yield from the sensitizer to the emitter, and the TTA and FL yields of the emitter, it thus can be expressed as (1)where f is a statistical factor representing the probability to obtain a singlet in an emitter from two emitter triplets via TTA. f depends on the relative alignment of S1, T1, and T2 as well as other energy levels lying in the vicinity of 2T1 and thus accessible through TTA.13,40 In this representation ΦTTA is determined by the competition of the second- and first-order decay rates, i.e. the TTA rate and the spontaneous or impurity related decay rate, respectively. As the TTA process starts prevailing, ΦTTA approaches unity. We note that in this work ΦUC is defined as the number of photons emitted per number absorbed, and since in TTA at most one UC photon can be produced per two absorbed ones, it cannot exceed 50%. Therefore, the factor ½ here imposes a theoretical limit of 50% for ΦUC in the case that all other quantities in eqn (1) are equal to unity. To determine ΦUC of the studied UC systems Rub:PdPc, Rub:PtPc and tBRub:PdPc, the efficiency of each subsequent step has been assessed. Considering ΦISC > 99% previously deduced for our sensitizers PdPc and PtPc, and ΦFL ≈ 90% estimated for the Rub and tBRub emitters at high concentrations (18 mM), determination of ΦUC inferred finding the rest of the quantities, namely, ΦTET and ΦTTA from eqn (1). ΦTET from the phthalocyanine sensitizer to rubrene emitter was elucidated from the triplet quenching experiments, where the change in the triplet lifetime of the sensitizer due to the TET induced quenching was assessed.21,46,47ΦTET was estimated from the ratio of the quenched (τ1) and non-quenched (τ0) triplet lifetimes of the sensitizer according to (2)
Obtaining τ0 implied measuring the triplet decay dynamics as a function of emitter concentration and linearly extrapolating the inverse of the quenched lifetime 1/τ1 to zero emitter concentration. Since triplet states are dark, their concentration was monitored by using the UC signal as a probe. Given that the dominant triplet relaxation pathway is spontaneous decay, the temporal dynamics of the UC intensity, which is proportional to the square of the triplet concentration of Rub, [TRub1]2, can be described by (3)where τ1 represents the rise time of IUC due to the TET from the sensitizer to the emitter, while τ2 corresponds to the triplet lifetime of the emitter; a1 and a2 are freely adjustable parameters. UC transients along with their fits (eqn (3)) for the Rub:PdPc and for Rub:PtPc and tBRub:PdPc systems at different emitter concentrations are presented in Fig. 4. Clearly τ1 estimated from the fits exhibits shortening with increasing emitter concentration for all the studied UC systems, which occurs because of the facilitated TET. Conversely, τ2 remains roughly similar (∼100 μs) at different concentrations of Rub or tBRub, indicating the same spontaneous triplet lifetime in the rubrene-based emitters (the insets of Fig. 4). The obtained triplet lifetime of rubrene due to first-order decay was in agreement with other reports.38
 Fig. 4  UC transients of the (a) Rub:PdPc, (b) Rub:PtPc and (c) tBRub:PdPc systems at a fixed sensitizer concentration (15 μM) and different emitter concentrations (indicated) obtained using nanosecond laser excitation at 730 nm. The insets depict the transients in a longer time-frame. 
The triplet exciton lifetimes (τ0) of the phthalocyanine sensitizers were estimated by linearly extrapolating the inverse of the rise time 1/τ1 to zero emitter concentration as shown in Fig. 5. τ0 was found to be on the order of several microseconds (3.3–4.3 μs) for PdPc, while on the sub-microsecond scale (0.7 μs) for PtPc (Table 1). The calculated ΦTET (from eqn (2)) at the largest emitter concentration yielded 82%, 71% and 56% for the Rub:PdPc, Rub:PtPc and tBRub:PdPc systems, respectively. Although a rather high TET efficiency was achieved for Rub:PdPc, the somewhat reduced ΦTET obtained for the similar system with only the palladium in the sensitizer replaced by platinum could be explained by the shorter triplet lifetime of PtPc. The fast intrinsic decay of triplets in PtPc implies an alternative deactivation channel hence competing with TET to the Rub emitter and reducing ΦTET. This makes PdPc more favourable as a sensitizer with respect to PtPc for UC systems. The least efficient TET from PdPc to tBRub is attributed to t-butyl moieties in rubrene, which evidently act as spacers, hindering short-range Dexter energy transfer. A similar reduction of TET with introduction of alkyl groups was also reported for perylene derivatives.48
 Fig. 5  The inverse rise time of the (a) Rub:PdPc, (b) Rub:PtPc and (c) tBRub:PdPc systems as a function of emitter concentration. The concentration of sensitizers PdPc and PtPc was fixed at 15 μM. The triplet lifetime of the sensitizers (τ0) was estimated as the inverse of the intercept as indicated. 
The product of the statistical probability and TTA quantum yield [f·ΦTTA] in the studied UC systems was estimated by directly comparing the delayed (IUC) and prompt (IFL) FL intensities and considering that both emissions originate from the same emitter species in the same environment.40,49 For this experiment we used a perpendicular excitation–detection configuration like that shown in the inset of Fig. 3 with Δx = 0, except that the detector was moved by 2 cm away from the cell to make the photon collection efficiency less sensitive to the excitation penetration depth (see the ESI† for details). The comparison of IUC and IFL cancelled any possible FL quenching including that due to emitter self-absorption, thus enabling us to obtain [f·ΦTTA] from eqn (4) and (5) where the ratio of the UC and FL quantum yields, each representing the number of photons emitted per absorbed ones, is simply expressed through the ratio of IUC and IFL (4) (5)
To warrant the validity of the expression, the number of absorbed photons was substituted by the excitation intensity (Iexc), ensuring that all incident excitation (at 485 nm and 730 nm) is absorbed during the experiment, giving rise to the corresponding IUC and IFL values irrespective of the excitation penetration depth in the UC solution (see the ESI† for details). λ485 and λ730, the excitation wavelengths for IFL and IUC, respectively, were introduced into the formula to correct the excitation intensities for the photon number. Since ΦTET and ΦISC have been already determined for the Rub:PdPc, Rub:PtPc and tBRub:PdPc systems, evaluation of their [f·ΦTTA] essentially implied measuring their IUC and IFL. These quantities as a function of Iexc for the three systems are displayed in Fig. 6a–c. While IFL exhibited typical linear behavior in the whole range of pump densities, IUC expressed quadratic behaviour at lower Iexc, which changed to linear at a threshold UC intensity (Ith) with increasing Iexc. The deviation of IFL from linear behavior at the highest CW excitation (>20 W cm−2) was caused by emitter degradation. The obtained Ith was found to vary from the lowest in Rub:PdPc (Ith = 1.9 W cm−2) to the highest in Rub:PtPc (Ith = 11 W cm−2). Taking into account that Ith is expressed as50 (6)where kT and γTTA are the spontaneous triplet decay and TTA rate, respectively, both depending on the emitter properties only, whereas α(E) is the absorption coefficient of the sensitizer, the obtained differences in Ith could be explained as follows. The five times higher UC threshold in the Rub:PtPc system containing a different sensitizer yet the same emitter as in Rub:PdPc could be understood by taking into account the 4-fold smaller absorbance of the PtPc sensitizer as compared to that of PdPc at the UC excitation wavelength (Fig. 1) and by the 10% lower ΦTET. Meanwhile the roughly twice as high Ith in the tBRub:PdPc system (Ith = 3.6 W cm−2) as compared to that in Rub:PdPc could be explained by both ΦTET and γTTA being reduced (to be discussed below). In fact, Ith can be reduced significantly for all the studied systems by increasing the sensitizer concentration and thereby improving α(E) and ΦTET,50 however, at the cost of diminished ΦUC due to the enhanced energy back-transfer from the emitter to the sensitizer (ESI,† Fig. S19).

UC threshold values (Ith) are indicated. (d–f) Excitation dependences of the product [f·ΦTTA] of the same systems calculated according to eqn (4). f values are indicated. 
The product [f·ΦTTA] estimated in accordance with eqn (5) for the investigated UC systems is plotted in Fig. 6d–f as a function of the excitation intensity. To avoid artefacts in this estimation at the highest CW excitations due to the emitter degradation, the IFL data were assumed to behave linearly at >20 W cm−2, similarly to the IFL behavior below this excitation. [f·ΦTTA] was found to increase with increasing Iexc up to the Ith point of the corresponding UC system and then saturate beyond this point. According to the definition of ΦTTA (7)saturation is reached when TTA outcompetes spontaneous triplet decay with increasing triplet concentration [T1]. In the saturation regime ΦTTA= 1, permitting the determination of f from the saturated value. So, an f value of 15.6% was obtained for the Rub:PdPc system. Although the different sensitizer employed in the Rub:PtPc system shifted the saturation of ΦTTA to much higher excitation intensities, the statistical factor determined at saturation yielded f = 15.4%. As expected the attained value was very similar to that of the Rub:PdPc system, possessing an identical emitter species. A similar value (∼13%) for the rubrene emitter in the TTA saturation regime was also reported in texaphyrin-sensitized photon UC.21 In stark contrast, a 3-fold smaller f value (5.3%) was estimated in the tBRub:PdPc system featuring additional t-butyl moieties in the rubrene emitter. Given the negligibly small differences in the singlet and triplet state energies of both emitters, the reason for the reduced f factor in tBRub is unclear and still under investigation.
The statistical probability factor obtained for Rub exceeded the 11.1% statistical limit, which assumes involvement of both the triplet and quintet states as well as complete quenching of encounter complexes in these states to the singlet ground state.49 On the other hand, the deduced f was below the 20% limit, which is reached in the case that the triplet and quintet encounter complexes decay back into the triplet state.13,40 Thus, most likely the f of 15.6% (as complying with 11.1% < f < 20%) can be explained by a portion of the triplet and quintet encounter complexes decaying to the ground state while the rest relax back to the triplet manifold.
Interestingly, the statistical probability factor obtained for the unmodified Rub emitter in UC solution was found to be 4 times lower as compared to that estimated in ref. 41. However, we need to emphasize that the difference in the estimation of f could arise due to the very different excitation regimes used in these experiments. As detailed in ref. 40 and 41, the femtosecond pulsed-laser excitation employed was likely causing saturation of sensitizer excitation and absorption bleaching, resulting in a larger excitation penetration depth without increasing the local triplet concentration. This caused saturation of ΦTTA even when TTA was not dominant. Therefore, to estimate f, additional kinetic analysis of decaying triplets was performed to separate the proportion decaying via a first-order process and via TTA. Meanwhile, in our CW excitation experiments no sensitizer saturation and consequently bleaching were observed except probably at the highest Iexc (∼100 W cm−2) used. This enabled us to attain saturation of ΦTTA explicitly due to the governance of TTA and thus deduce f in a straightforward manner from eqn (7) (Fig. 6d–f). The slight decrease of [f·ΦTTA] from the saturated value at the highest Iexc in Rub:PdPc and tBRub:PdPc was caused by analogous deviation of IUC from the linear relationship. Taking into account that an Iexc of 100 W cm−2 excites ∼4 μM of PdPc (given τPdPc1 ≈ 1 μs and excitation penetration depth dPdPc = 0.15 cm), which is on the same order as that used in our experiments (15 μM), the IUC deviation at the highest Iexc could indeed be affected by the sensitizer saturation. To verify that the significantly lower f found in this work as compared to that estimated in ref. 41 is not due to the different excitation–detection configuration employed, we additionally evaluated the ratio of IUC and IFL (in accordance with eqn (5)) in a front-face geometry. The evaluation under the TTA saturation conditions yielded the same statistical probability f = 15 ± 3% for rubrene as in the case of the previously exploited perpendicular excitation–detection geometry (ESI,† Fig. S20). This f imposes a maximum limit of 1/2·f ≈ 8% on the ΦUC of rubrene UC systems provided all the energy transfer/conversion steps in TTA-UC are 100% efficient. Since out of numerous reports on rubrene-based UC systems there was not a single demonstration of ΦUC exceeding this limit,7,19,21,32,33,37,40,41 we strongly believe that the obtained statistical probability value is reasonable.
The determined efficiencies for all intermediate energy transfer steps (ISC, TET, TTA and FL) and the statistical probability factor f of the studied UC systems (see Table 2) allowed us to calculate their ΦUC by using eqn (1). The highest ΦUC values of 5.7% and 4.9% were achieved in the Rub:PdPc and Rub:PtPc systems, respectively, whereas the lowest one (1.3%) in tBRub:PdPc. This remarkable factor-of-5 difference in f in Rub and tBRub was much less affected by the variance in the TET yields of the UC systems. The result revealed the negative impact of the t-butyl moieties in the emitter on the UC performance, which mainly resulted from the significantly reduced probability for a pair of triplet t-butyl-rubrene molecules to yield one singlet emitter state.

To confirm the ΦUC obtained above, we carried out an independent evaluation by utilizing the integrating sphere method. However, as discussed previously, the strong self-absorption in the highly concentrated emitter solution induced a self-quenching effect, which resulted in severely underestimated ΦUC in the UC systems. As an example, the reabsorbed UC spectrum obtained in the sphere for the Rub (18 mM):PdPc (15 μM) system is displayed in Fig. 7 on a semi-log scale as the dashed line.
 Fig. 7  Uncorrected (dashed line) and corrected for reabsorption (solid line) UC emission spectrum of Rub (18 mM):PdPc (15 μM) in toluene solution under CW excitation at 730 nm. The area under the curves is proportional to the number of photons registered. 
The spectrum peak position was found to be similar to that obtained at the largest Δx as shown in Fig. 3 and hence the deduced ΦUC value from this reabsorbed UC spectrum integral has barely reached 1.2%. To be able to compare ΦUC obtained by the integrating sphere with that estimated previously with self-quenching effects canceled out, a correction for the emitter self-absorption needed to be carried out. For this we employed the non-reabsorbed FL of the sensitizer PdPc (FLPdPc) as an internal reference. Recently, a similar method to correct for the UC reabsorption utilizing the undistorted phosphorescence signal of a sensitizer was reported.51 Taking into account that the FLPdPc intensity remains constant irrespective of the Rub concentration (Fig. 2a), the reabsorbed FL spectrum of Rub could be restored by taking the reabsorption-free UC spectrum obtained at Δx = 0 (Fig. 3) and matching its sensitizer FL part (FLPdPc) with the analogous part in the distorted spectrum (Fig. 7). The corrected UC spectrum denoted by the solid line exhibited a 4.6 times larger integral than the uncorrected one, resulting in corrected ΦUC = 5.5% for the Rub (18 mM):PdPc (15 μM) system. Alternatively, ΦUC could be also deduced by comparing the integral of FLPdPc corresponding to the previously estimated ΦFL value of 0.3% (Table 1) with that of the corrected UC spectrum. The corrected ΦUC values found in an analogous manner for the other two systems Rub (18 mM):PtPc (15 μM) and tBRub (18 mM):PdPc (15 μM) were 5.4% and 1.3%, respectively. Importantly, the corrected for emitter self-absorption ΦUC values estimated by the two independent methods, i.e. by the integrating sphere and by evaluating the efficiencies of each subsequent energy transfer step according to eqn (1), yielded very similar values for all three UC systems, proving the reliability of our results, including f estimates.
Taking advantage of the solubility improving t-butyl moieties in tBRub, we further increased the concentration of the emitter from 18 mM, which is the solubility limit of Rub, to 40 mM (the solubility limit of tBRub). Even though this enhanced ΦUC of tBRub (40 mM):PdPc (15 μM) from 1.3% to 2.2%, the attained value was still significantly lower as compared to that obtained in the unsubstituted rubrene system Rub (18 mM):PdPc (15 μM). This result clearly demonstrates that the benefit of attaining larger tBRub emitter concentrations by introducing alkyl groups to rubrene in anticipation of enhanced Dexter energy transfer cannot outcompete the big disadvantage related to the severely reduced statistical probability to obtain a singlet from two triplets in the emitter via TTA. It is worth pointing out that the maximal ΦUC (5.7%) obtained by optimizing the emitter and sensitizer concentrations in Rub:PdPc is among the largest reported for NIR-to-vis UC systems absorbing at >730 nm.19–21,29,32,33 We stress that differently from us the vast majority of reports use a multiplication factor of 2 in the evaluation of ΦUC so as to normalize the UC yield to 100%. Such normalization in our case will translate to a maximum ΦUC of 11.2%.
Conclusions
In summary, we studied phthalocyanine-sensitized NIR-to-vis photon upconversion in rubrene in an effort to determine the factors limiting the UC efficiency. This study is of crucial importance from the application point of view, since typical ΦUC values achieved in UC systems under NIR excitation (>730 nm) are below 4%. By thoroughly assessing subsequent energy transfer/conversion steps in the TTA-mediated UC scheme, we determined rubrene's statistical probability (f = 15.5 ± 3%) to obtain a singlet from two triplets via TTA to be the prime efficiency-limiting factor in the optimized UC systems. We emphasize that unlike previous reports exploiting femtosecond pulsed-laser excitation, in this work a 4-fold lower value of the f factor was estimated in the TTA saturation regime achieved under CW excitation, i.e. the expected working conditions of UC systems utilized for practical applications. The obtained low f sets a maximum limit of ∼8% (≈ 1/2·f) for ΦUC in rubrene UC systems provided there are no losses in the ISC, TET, TTA and FL quantum yields.
The optimized Rub (18 mM):PdPc (15 μM) system in toluene solution was shown to express a maximum ΦUC of 5.6 ± 1.2%, which was verified by two independent methods including an integrating sphere, for which the non-reabsorbed FL of the sensitizer was used as an internal reference to correct the UC for emitter self-absorption. The attained maximum ΦUC is among the largest reported for NIR-to-vis UC systems capable of operating under excitation >730 nm. The further increase of the emitter concentration from 18 mM to 40 mM achieved via introduction of solubility improving t-butyl groups in an attempt to enhance Dexter energy transfer failed to surpass the ΦUC of the Rub (18 mM):PdPc (15 μM) system mainly because of the significantly reduced statistical probability factor (f = 5.3 ± 1%) of t-butyl-substituted rubrene. Regrettably, on one hand, the obtained low statistical probability is expected to demotivate researchers and engineers, thereby preventing them from utilizing rubrene-based UC systems in applications. However, on the other hand, this should encourage the community to search for alternative emitters operational in the NIR-vis range.
Experimental section
Materials and synthesis
All reagents and starting materials were obtained from commercial sources and used as received. Rubrene (Rub) was purchased in sublimed grade, whereas the synthesized t-butyl-rubrene (tBRub) was purified by vacuum sublimation prior to experiments. The synthesis and identification of the new Pd- and Pt-phthalocyanine (PdPc and PtPc) sensitizers and new tBRub emitter are provided in the ESI.†
Preparation of the upconverting solutions
The upconverting solutions composed of a mixture of sensitizer and emitter as well as the solutions of each constituent including metal-free phthalocyanine were prepared in a nitrogen-filled glovebox with O2 and H2O concentrations below 0.1 ppm. The toluene solutions of each sensitizer PdPc and PtPc and emitter Rub used in the mixtures were prepared at an initial concentration of 10 mg mL−1, whereas a concentration of 30 mg mL−1 was used for the tBRub emitter. The UC solutions (Rub:PdPc, Rub:PtPc and tBRub:PdPc) were prepared by mixing the emitters and sensitizers at appropriate ratios to result in final concentrations of Rub (0 mM, 0.1 mM, 0.5 mM, 2.5 mM, 18 mM):PdPc (15 μM), Rub (0 mM, 1 mM, 4.5 mM, 18 mM):PtPc (15 μM, 56 μM) and tBRub (0 mM, 4.5 mM, 7.5 mM, 18 mM, 40 mM):PdPc (15 μM). Prior to mixing the emitters and sensitizers, each solution was stirred overnight at 50 °C. Quartz cells having inner dimensions of 10 × 10 mm with UC solutions were carefully sealed before removing from the glovebox for measurements. The sealing was essential to protect them from triplet quenching by oxygen as well as to avoid photoinduced degradation of the rubrene emitters.34
Optical techniques
The absorption spectra of the dilute solutions of the compounds were recorded using a UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer Lambda 950 (PerkinElmer). Direct fluorescence (FL) excitation of the rubrene-based emitters was accomplished by using a continuous-wave (CW) 485 nm-wavelength semiconductor laser diode (Picoquant). UC emission was induced by exciting at the Q band of the PdPc and PtPc sensitizers by using a CW 730 nm-wavelength semiconductor laser diode (Picoquant). FL and UC emission were measured utilizing an excitation–detection geometry where the emission signal was detected in a direction perpendicular to the excitation beam. Phosphorescence and UC transients were measured by employing a tunable-wavelength optical amplifier (Ekspla) pumped by a nanosecond Nd3+:YAG laser (wavelength – 730 nm, pulse duration – 5 ns, repetition rate – 1 kHz). Steady state FL and UC emission spectra were measured using a back-thinned CCD spectrometer PMA-12 (Hamamatsu). The phosphorescence of the sensitizers was recorded with an infrared CCD iDus (Andor), whereas UC transients were measured with a time-gated iCCD camera New iStar DH340T (Andor). FL and UC emission quantum yields (ΦFL and ΦUC) were estimated by utilizing an integrating sphere (Sphere Optics) coupled to the CCD PMA-12 spectrometer via an optical fiber. The estimations were carried out according to the method described in ref. 52. No filter was used in these measurements, since the UC samples absorbed >95% of the incident light, allowing us to measure both excitation and sample emission signals during the same acquisition. Prior to the measurements the spectral sensitivity of the system was calibrated using halogen and deuterium calibration lamps (Bentham). Some of the ΦFL estimations were also conducted by using a relative method, where ΦFL was determined by comparing its spectrally integrated emission with that of a standard with known ΦFL. A dilute solution of fluorescein (10 μM) in 0.1 M NaOH with ΦFL = 92% was used a ΦFL standard in these measurements.53 To minimize self-absorption in these measurements a specific excitation–detection geometry was employed, where the exciting beam was directed near the very edge of the cell, while the emission signal was detected in a perpendicular direction. All the experiments were performed at room temperature.
