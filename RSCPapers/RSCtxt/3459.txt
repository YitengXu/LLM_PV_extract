, Accepted 3rd July 2015First published on 8th July 2015AbstractUp-conversion (UC) phosphors of (Ca1−xSrx)In2O4:Yb3+/Ho3+ (x = 0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9, 1.0) were prepared. Based on the crystal structure evolution of these series solid solution samples, which were characterized by Rietveld refinement, the variation of UC luminescent properties was discussed in detail. Sr and Ca occupied one position and Yb/Ho dissolved in the In ion site in the (Ca1−xSrx)In2O4 lattice. With increasing Sr substituting Ca atoms, the cell parameters and cell volumes of these samples increased linearly, and distortions of (Ca/Sr)O8 polyhedron were formed. The distortions on crystal structures showed a negative relation with UC luminescent intensities in these series phosphors.
Introduction
The study of up-conversion (UC) phosphors has attracted great attention recently due to its significant potential application in light emitting displays, solid-state lasers, biological labelling, solar energy conversion, and so on.1,2 As spectral modification materials, UC phosphors showed great importance for converting multiple photons of lower energy into one photon of high energy according to anti-Stokes emission processes. Intense UC luminescence from infrared to visible light was observed widely in many UC phosphors.3–5
Recently, some studies showed that the luminescence of ultra-violet excited phosphors always was affected greatly by its crystal structure.6–10 However, the mechanism of how the crystal structure influences the optical properties of UC materials is still not clear enough. In order to study the relationships between UC luminescence properties and crystal structures, Yb3+/Ho3+ co-doped (Ca1−xSrx)In2O4, as well as CaIn2O4 and SrIn2O4 were prepared. Indium (In) belongs to the same group with boron, aluminium and gallium, it was suggested as an excellent host lattice for luminescence.11,12 Recent reports showed that Yb3+/Ho3+ co-doped CaIn2O4 and SrIn2O4 have excellent UC luminescent properties. CaIn2O4 and SrIn2O4 have low phonon energies (∼475 cm−1), which is much lower than those of other typical oxide hosts, such as Y2O3 (∼600 cm−1), silicate (∼1100 cm−1), they can therefore achieve high-efficiency UC emissions.13–17 Previously, the structure of CaIn2O4 was discussed in literatures, but no correct ICSD (Inorganic Crystal Structure Database) or JCPDS (Joint Committee on Powder Diffraction Standards) file for the CaIn2O4 is available.12 In the SrIn2O4 structure (orthorhombic, Pnma, ICSD #16241), two kinds of distorted InO6 octahedra were connected to form a network, and Sr2+ ions located in the middle of the formed pentagonal prism tunnel. As the similarity of Ca2+ and Sr2+ ions, (Ca1−xSrx)In2O4 shows great potential in the formation of continuous solid solution. As the difference, replacement between Ca and Sr are expected to change the crystal structure slightly and then influence the UC luminescent properties of UC phosphors. For Ho3+ and Yb3+ ions, they are important activator and sensitizer for UC phosphors, respectively.18–20
In this work, UC phosphors of Yb3+/Ho3+ co-doped (Ca1−xSrx)In2O4 continuous solid solution were synthesized via a solid-state reaction process. According to our previous result, the radio of Yb3+/Ho3+ was determined as 0.1/0.005 to get a good UC luminescence.14 The relationship between crystal structure evolution and UC luminescent properties of this series samples were discussed in detail.
Experimental
Starting materials of CaCO3(A.R.), SrCO3(A.R.), In2O3(99.995%), Yb2O3(99.995%), Ho2O3(99.995%), Yb2O3(99.995%) were weighted according to stoichiometric ratio, and then the mixtures were ground thoroughly in an agate mortar. After that, the mixtures were sintered at 1300 °C for 3 hours, with the heating rate of 5 °C min−1, and then cooled to room temperature naturally. All the samples were washed for three times by the deionized water and dried for the following measurement.
The X-ray powder diffractometer (D8-ADVANCE, Bruker Corporation, Germany) with Cu-Kα and linear VANTEC detector was used for Rietveld analysis. The step size of 2θ was 0.02°, and the counting time was 2 s per step. Rietveld refinement was performed by using TOPAS 4.2.21 The UC luminescent spectra were recorded on a spectrophotometer (F-4600, Hitachi, Japan) equipped with an external power-controllable 980 nm semiconductor laser (Beijing Viasho Technology Company, China) as the excitation source. Diffuse reflection spectra were measured on a UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-3600, Japan) attached to an integral sphere, and BaSO4 was used as a reference standard. All the measurements were carried out at room temperature.
Results and discussion
X-ray diffraction (XRD) was employed to characterize the structure evolution of all the 0.1Yb3+/0.005Ho3+ doped (Ca1−xSrx)In2O4 (x = 0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9, 1.0) samples. Fig. 1 showed the selected XRD patterns of (Ca0.5Sr0.5)In2O4:Yb3+/Ho3+ sample, as well as pure CaIn2O4 and SrIn2O4. Because of no correct ICSD or JCPDS file for the CaIn2O4 is available, all X-ray patterns of (Ca1−xSrx)In2O4:Yb3+/Ho3+ were indexed by orthorhombic cell (Pnma) with parameters close to SrIn2O4 (ICSD #16241), so this crystal structure was used to make Rietveld refinement. In crystal structure there is only one position which can be occupied by Sr and Ca, and this position is multiplied by four positions by symmetry elements (Fig. 2). The occupations of Sr/Ca ions were fixed during refinement. Also Yb3+ and Ho3+ ions are dissolved in the lattice and substituted In3+ ions partly, and their occupancies were fixed. The refinement of all the samples of (Ca1−xSrx)In2O4:Yb3+/Ho3+, pure CaIn2O4 and SrIn2O4 were stable, and ended with low R-factors (shown in Table 1, Fig. 1). (Ca/Sr)O8 square antiprism and (In/Yb/Ho)O6 octahedra are existed in the crystal structure simultaneously. The detailed crystal structure of (Ca1−xSrx)In2O4:0.1Yb3+/0.005Ho3+ was shown in Fig. 2.

Fig. 3 showed the refined lattice parameters of a, b, c, and unit cell volume (V) as functions of x values in (Ca1−xSrx)In2O4:Yb3+/Ho3+ (x = 0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9, 1.0) samples, and a, b, c, and V value in pure CaIn2O4 and SrIn2O4. Since Ca/Sr in eight coordination, and the ionic radii IR (Ca2+, CN = 8) = 1.12 Å, IR (Sr2+, = 1.26 Å),22 lattice parameters of a, b, c and V of these samples showed a linear increase with the increasing Sr content, indicating that the (Ca1−xSrx)In2O4 formed continuous solid solution. Moreover, pure CaIn2O4 and SrIn2O4 have smaller lattice parameters and cell volumes than Yb3+/Ho3+ co-doped CaIn2O4 and SrIn2O4, respectively. This is because In/Yb/Ho in six coordination, and IR (Yb3+, CN = 6) = 0.868 Å, IR (Ho3+, CN = 6) = 0.901 Å, IR (In3+, CN = 6) = 0.8 Å; Yb3+/Ho3+ dopants in CaIn2O4 or SrIn2O4 enlarged the unit cells due to their larger IR than In3+, testifying that Yb3+ and Ho3+ ions occupied the In3+ ions sites.
 Fig. 3  Refined lattice parameter of a, b, c, and unit cell volume (V) showed a linear increase as function of x values in (Ca1−xSrx)In2O4:Yb3+/Ho3+ (x = 0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9, 1.0), and a, b, c, V values in pure CaIn2O4 and SrIn2O4. 
Fig. 4 gave the UC emission spectra of pure CaIn2O4, (Ca1−xSrx)In2O4:0.1Yb3+/0.005Ho3+ (x = 0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9, 1.0), and pure SrIn2O4 upon 980 nm laser excitation. Lacking of rare earth sensitive and active ions, no UC emission was observed in pure CaIn2O4 and SrIn2O4 samples. For (Ca1−xSrx)In2O4:Yb3+/Ho3+, strong green emission with the strongest peak at 546 nm was obtained, which was associated with the characteristic energy level transition of 5S2(5F4) → 5I8 of Ho3+.13,17,23 SrIn2O4:Yb3+/Ho3+ showed the strongest UC luminescence among all the samples, suggesting that SrIn2O4 would be an excellent UC host material. Nevertheless, it can be seen that majority of Ca/Sr ratio substituted samples possessed lower UC luminescent intensities than CaIn2O4:Yb3+/Ho3+ and SrIn2O4:Yb3+/Ho3+ samples.
 Fig. 4  UC emission spectra of pure CaIn2O4, (Ca1−xSrx)In2O4:0.1Yb3+/0.005Ho3+ (x = 0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9, 1.0), and pure SrIn2O4 upon 980 nm laser excitation, and the inset shows the variation of UC emission intensities. 
In order to explain the UC emission intensity differences in Ca/Sr ratio substituted samples, the detailed crystal structures and polyhedrons of some samples were analysed. The (Ca/Sr)O8 polyhedral distortion index, D, can be calculated as followed: 
(1)where li is the distance between central atom and the ith coordinating atom, and the lav is the mean bond length.7 The calculated distortion of pure CaIn2O4, (Ca1−xSrx)In2O4:Yb3+/Ho3+ (x = 0.1, 0.5, 0.9), and pure SrIn2O4 were determined as 0.234, 0.267, 0.392, 0.264, 0.223, respectively. With the increased Sr substituting Ca, the UC emission intensities of (Ca1−xSrx)In2O4:Yb3+/Ho3+ decreased firstly and then increased, as shown in Fig. 4 and 5(a). Meanwhile, the crystal structures of (Ca1−xSrx)In2O4:Yb3+/Ho3+ became distort with the substitution between Ca/Sr, and the distortions enlarged firstly and then reduced, as shown in Fig. 5(b). In Fig. 5(c), the distortions also can be observed from the variations of Ca–O3 bond distances: 2.677 and 2.671 in pure CaIn2O4, 2.590 and 2.903 in (Ca0.5Sr0.5)In2O4:Yb3+/Ho3+, 2.723 and 2.732 in pure SrIn2O4.
 Fig. 5  UC emission intensities at 546 nm of (Ca1−xSrx)In2O4:0.1Yb3+/0.005Ho3+ (x = 0.1, 0.5, 0.9) (a); calculated distortion indexes of (Ca/Sr)O8 polyhedron in pure CaIn2O4, (Ca1−xSrx)In2O4:0.1Yb3+/0.005Ho3+ (x = 0.1, 0.5, 0.9), and pure SrIn2O4 (b); (Ca/Sr)O8 polyhedron of pure CaIn2O4, Ca1−xSrxIn2O4:0.1Yb3+/0.005Ho3+ (x = 0.1, 0.5, 0.9), and pure SrIn2O4 (c). 
Fig. 6 gave the diffuse reflection spectra of pure CaIn2O4, Ca1−xSrxIn2O4:0.1Yb3+/0.005Ho3+ (x = 0.1, 0.5, 0.9), and pure SrIn2O4 samples. No absorption bands except for UV region were found in the non-doped CaIn2O4 and SrIn2O4. However, absorption valley centred at 449, 540, 643 nm (Ho3+ ions) and 980 nm (Yb3+ ions) were observed. In Yb3+/Ho3+ doped UC phosphors, two channels of excitations are responsible for the impurity luminescence. One is direct excitation of Ho3+ ions. The other is indirect excitation, followed by an energy transfer from the Yb3+ to the Ho3+ ions to cause the luminescence. These three diffuse reflection patterns of Yb3+/Ho3+ co-doped Ca1−xSrxIn2O4 (x = 0.1, 0.5, 0.9) are similar, revealing that the substitution between Ca and Sr did not change the UC luminescence mechanism for Ho3+ or Yb3+/Ho3+.

Accordingly, a new model that the distortion (D) of (Ca/Sr)O8 polyhedron has a negative relation with UC luminescent intensity (I) in (Ca1−xSrx)In2O4:Yb3+/Ho3+ samples was proposed: 
(2)
The lattice expansion and increased distortion cause by partial substitution for Ca/Sr changed the crystal field acting on the Ho3+ or Yb3+/Ho3+ ions,24,25 leading to the variation of UC luminescent properties in the Yb3+/Ho3+ co-doped (Ca1−xSrx)In2O4 continuous solid solution phosphors.
Fig. 7 showed the dependence of UC emission intensities upon different pumping powers of CaIn2O4:Yb3+/Ho3+(a), typical (Ca0.5Sr0.5)In2O4:Yb3+/Ho3+(b), and SrIn2O4:Yb3+/Ho3+(c). In (Ca0.5Sr0.5)In2O4:Yb3+/Ho3+ sample, the double logarithmic plot of the integrated intensities of emissions at 546 nm (5S2/5F4 → 5I8) and 673 nm (5F5 → 5I8) versus the pump powers yields two straight lines with slopes of 1.78 ± 0.11 and 1.67 ± 0.09, respectively. Furthermore, the slopes were determined as 1.78 ± 0.08 and 1.63 ± 0.07 in CaIn2O4:Yb3+/Ho3+, as well as 1.88 ± 0.09 and 1.75 ± 0.08 in SrIn2O4:Yb3+/Ho3+. These slopes indicated that the UC emissions in all Yb3+/Ho3+ co-doped (Ca1−xSrx)In2O4 UC phosphors are two-photon process. Fig. 7(d) proposed the main UC luminescence mechanism of these Yb3+/Ho3+ co-doped phosphors. In the present system, the excited Yb3+ ions transferred its energy to neighbouring Ho3+ ion through energy transfer (ET) process 2F5/2 (Yb3+) + 5I8 (Ho3+) → 2F7/2 (Yb3+) + 5I6 (Ho3+), 2F5/2 (Yb3+) + 5I6 (Ho3+) → 2F7/2 (Yb3+) + 5F4/5S2 (Ho3+), 2F5/2 (Yb3+) + 5I7 (Ho3+) → 2F7/2 (Yb3+) + 7F5 (Ho3+), and then the excited Ho3+ ion emit green emissions (546 nm, 5S2/5F4 → 5I8) and red emission (673 nm, 5F5 → 5I8).

Conclusions
Ca/Sr ratio dependent structure and up-conversion luminescence of (Ca1−xSrx)In2O4:Yb3+/Ho3+ (x = 0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9, 1.0) phosphors were studied in detail, and the structure evolution of these series samples were showed by Rietveld refinement. With increasing Sr atoms substituting Ca in the (Ca1−xSrx)In2O4 lattice, the cell parameters and cell volumes of these samples increase linearly. Sr2+ and Ca2+ occupied one position and Yb3+/Ho3+ dissolved in the In3+ site. Since the differences between Sr2+ and Ca2+, (Ca/Sr)O8 polyhedron distortions were formed, and these distortions suggested a negative relation with UC luminescent intensities in these series phosphors. The UC luminescent properties, pumping powers study and possible UC mechanism of these samples also were discussed.
