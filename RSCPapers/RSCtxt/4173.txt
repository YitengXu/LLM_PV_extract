    , Accepted 20th September 2021First published on 21st September 2021AbstractMetal halide perovskites are emerging materials for next-generation optoelectronic devices, of which the all-inorganic CsPbBr3 perovskite has attracted increasing attention due to its outstanding stability and excellent photoelectric characteristics compared with organic–inorganic counterparts. However, the electroluminescence (EL) efficiencies of inorganic CsPbBr3 perovskite light-emitting diodes (PeLEDs) are unsatisfactory because of high trap densities, which lead to non-radiative recombination loss. Herein, by introducing potassium bromide (KBr), we successfully prepare zero-dimensional/three-dimensional (0D/3D) Cs4−xKxPbBr6/CsPbBr3 heterostructure perovskite films with suppressed trap density and improved photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY). The deep energy level of 0D Cs4−xKxPbBr6 phase is confirmed using DFT calculation. Moreover, the formation of the unique heterostructure inhibits the free charge diffusion at the grain boundary from suffering trapping and recombination, which facilitates efficient radiative recombination in the 3D CsPbBr3 phase. Therefore, the optimized green PeLEDs show a high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 12.8%, which is a six-fold improvement over the pristine one (2.1%), and a maximum brightness of 39400 cd m−2. Our work provides a rational charge carrier confinement strategy for developing high-performance PeLEDs and can be broadened to other potential perovskite materials, not restricted to the CsPbBr3-based perovskite films.
Introduction
Metal halide perovskites have attracted extensive attention due to their excellent optical and electrical properties. Moreover, perovskite materials have the advantages of narrow and tunable emission spectra and low-cost solution processing.1–3 In recent years, extensive research has been focused on PeLEDs. Especially, significant breakthroughs have been achieved in green PeLEDs. The first green PeLED was demonstrated in 2014 with an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 0.1% and a maximum luminance of 364 cd m−2.4 Notably, the performance of PeLEDs has improved quickly, with an EQE of 23.4%, using FA1−xGAxPbBr3 perovskite nanocrystals.5 Still, the instability and difficulty in large-scale nanocrystal synthesis restrict its practical application.6,7
The Cs-based all-inorganic halide perovskites, such as CsPbBr3, have been widely used as alternative emitters in PeLEDs due to their outstanding photoelectric characteristics and stability.8,9 However, the traditional one-step spin-coating method applies an inorganic CsPbBr3 precursor solution without any host materials, leading to non-uniform polycrystalline layers with poor quality.8 Consequently, the trap densities in CsPbBr3 perovskite are comparable with the charge carrier concentration in the typical PeLED operational regime. Moreover, charge carrier delocalization leads to strong trap-assisted non-radiative recombination effects in the grain boundary.10–12 Thus, manipulating charge carrier recombination dynamics has been found to be the crucial strategy to realize high device efficiencies in PeLEDs. Generally, charge carrier confinement in the perovskite crystal can be controlled through spatial confinement.10 The diffusion length can become smaller, and the exciton binding energy larger, by drastic shrinkage of grain size, which spatially confines the charge carriers within a crystal grain.8,13,14 The reduction of grain size always accompanies an increasing number of grain boundaries, inevitably leading to a large degree of surface defects. Apart from the aforementioned strategy, constructing a heterophased structure in films has been proven to be an effective method to fabricate stable and high-performance PSCs and PeLEDs.15,16 Due to the high crystallinity and good band alignments, the 2D/3D heterojunction effectively suppressed non-radiative recombination and enhanced photoelectric performance.17 Besides, the insulating nature of the bulky organic in the 2D perovskite is also a challenge for efficient charge transport. It has also been reported that different dimensional Cs-based perovskites can be obtained by controlling the stoichiometry between Cs, Pb and halide (X).18 Interestingly, 0D perovskites also possess larger exciton binding energy and deeper energy level, which effectively confine the electrons and holes. Recently, a heterostructure comprising 0D Cs4PbI6 and 3D γ-CsPbI3 with exciton confinement was manifested to achieve a stable all-inorganic perovskite solar cell with a high power conversion efficiency.19 The 0D/3D hybrids can inherit the charge confinement from the 0D phase and the outstanding optoelectronic properties from 3D perovskites.20 Therefore, a methodology that would form a 0D/3D multi-phase carrier centralization structure for CsPbBr3-based perovskite and suppress non-radiative recombination for enhanced luminescence quantum yield is a feasible alternative to realize an efficient PeLED.3,17,21,22
In this work, we demonstrate an efficient CsPbBr3-based PeLED by constructing the carrier centralization structure with in-situ fabrication of 0D/3D perovskite heterostructure, tuning the stoichiometry of the precursors between KBr and PbBr. To systematically confirm the existence of 0D Cs4−xKxPbBr6 phase, grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD), UV-vis absorption and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) were conducted. Density function theory (DFT) calculation suggests that a type I heterostructure can be formed between the 3D CsPbBr3 and the 0D Cs4−xKxPbBr6 phases, which results in confined excitons and enhanced radiative recombination in 3D phase. The structure can render the perovskite film PLQY of 35%, which is improved by a factor of 3 compared with the pristine counterpart (10%). Accordingly, the corresponding PeLEDs fabricated yield a maximum brightness of 39400 cd m−2, a maximum current efficiency of 43.7 cd A−1 and a peak EQE of 12.8%, about 6-fold higher than the control PeLEDs (2.1%). This 0D/3D charge carrier confinement strategy is proven to effectively facilitate radiative recombination, which is expected to boost the PeLED device efficiency. These findings further illustrate the feasibility of forming perovskite heterostructure and consequent property enhancement of the perovskite film, suggesting an alternative direction to fabricate highly efficient PeLEDs.
Experimental section
Materials
CsBr (99.999%), PbBr2 (99.999%), KBr (99.999%), DMSO (anhydrous, 99.9%), and DMF (anhydrous, 99.9%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. PEO (average Mv = 100000) and 18-crown-6 (99%) were purchased from Macklin. p-F-PEABr was purchased from TCI. PEDOT:PSS AI 4083 was purchased from Heraeus. TPBi (>99%) and LiF were purchased from Lumtec. All the materials were used as received.
Perovskite precursor solutions
CsBr, PbBr2 and p-F-PEABr were dissolved in a ratio of 1.1:1:0.2 in a DMSO/DMF mixed solvent (4:1, by volume) with a concentration of 0.2 M; 4 mg ml−1 PEO and 2 mg ml−1 18-crown-6 were also added. The incorporated KBr concentration was controlled by changing the molar feed ratios of K/Pb to 2.5%, 5.0%, 10%, 15% and 20%. All these perovskite precursor solutions were stirred overnight at 60 °C in a nitrogen-filled glove box.
Fabrication of perovskite LED
Pattern ITO-coated glass sheets were ultrasonically cleaned with deionized water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol for 15 mins each, then treated with oxygen plasma for 15 mins before depositing the PEDOT:PSS films. PEDOT:PSS was spin-coated onto the ITO substrates at 3000 rpm for 40 s, and the film was annealed at 150 °C for 30 min in air. The perovskite precursor solutions were spin-coated at 3500 rpm for 60 s, followed by annealing at 80 °C for 10 min. TPBi (40 nm) and LiF/Al electrodes (1 nm/100 nm) were deposited by thermal evaporation under a high vacuum of 2 × 10−4 Pa. The device area is 4.5 mm2, formed by the overlapping area of the ITO and Al electrodes.
Characterization measurement
Grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) analysis for the crystal structure was obtained by Cu Kα radiation (45 KV, 200 mA, Rigaku SmartLab 9 kW), and the incident angle was 0.02°. The ultraviolet-visible absorbance spectra (UV-Abs) of the perovskite films were measured using a PerkinElmer UV-vis-NIR spectrometer. The photoluminescence spectra (PL) and absolute photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) were measured using an Edinburgh Photoluminescence FLS 920 equipped with an integrated sphere. Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) was collected using time-correlated single-photon counting for 10000 counts. Excitation was provided by an Edinburgh EPL-375 nanosecond pulsed diode laser. The PL decay was fit using a triexponential decay function. The morphology was measured from field scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) images obtained using a TESCAN MAIA3. The energy-dispersive X-ray spectra (EDX) were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) using a Tescan VEGA3 microscope equipped with X-max5 EDX (Oxford Instruments). The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images were obtained using a JEOL JEM-2100F at 200 kV. The atomic force microscopy (AFM) image and roughness analysis were done using a Bruker NanoScope 8 X-ray photoelectron spectroscope (XPS) and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscope (UPS), measured on a Thermo Fisher Nexsa. The source was a monochromatic Al Kα (Ephoton = 1486.6 eV) with a 10 mA filament current and 12 keV filament voltage. UPS measurements utilized the He(I) photo line (21.22 eV) from a He discharge lamp and the high-binding energy secondary electron cutoff (Ecutoff), and the HOMO region data were extracted from the UPS spectra. The HOMO levels could be expressed as HOMO = 21.22 − (Ecutoff − EΔ) (where EΔ is the gap between the HOMO level and the Fermi level (EF)). Transient absorption (TA) measurements were performed on a femtosecond (fs) pump–probe system (Helios, Ultrafast System LLC) under ambient conditions. The pump pulses (wavelength: 400 nm, pump fluence: 0.3 μJ cm−2 pulse−1 at the sample surface, spot size: 2 mm) were generated by frequency doubling the 800 nm fs laser from a Ti:sapphire regenerative amplifier (Coherent Libra; 800 nm, 35 fs pulse width, 1 kHz) with a BBO crystal. The white-light probe continuum was generated by focusing the fundamental 800 nm beam from a Ti:sapphire laser onto a sapphire plate (2 mm thick). The time delay between the pump and probe pulses was varied by a motorized optical delay line (maximum ≈ 8 ns).
PeLED characterization
A Keithley 2400 source meter and a fibre integration sphere (FOIS-1) coupled with a QE Pro spectrometer (Ocean Optics) were utilized. The absolute radiance was calibrated by a standard Vis-NIR light source (HL-3P-INT-CAL plus, Ocean Optics). The EQE and spectral evolution with time was measured using the same system. All the measurements were conducted in ambient air at room temperature and without encapsulation.
DFT calculations
DFT calculations were carried out using the Vienna ab initio Simulation Package (VASP)23,24 with the frozen-core all-electron projector augmented wave (PAW)25,26 method. The Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE)27 generalized gradient approximation (GGA) was adopted to describe the exchange and correlation potential. The cut-off energy for the plane-wave basis set was set to 500 eV. For the crystal model, a cell of Cs24Pb6Br36 was adopted with a dimension of 14.06 × 14.06 × 17.58 Å. For K-incorporated models, one and three Cs atoms were replaced by K atoms, denoted as Cs23K1Pb6Br36 and Cs21K3Pb6Br36, respectively. Especially, three different K positions were considered for the Cs21K3Pb6Br36. The geometry optimizations were performed until the forces on each ion were reduced to below 0.01 eV Å−1, and the 3 × 3 × 2 k-point28 sampling of the Brillouin zone was used for all calculations.
Results and discussion
The perovskite films were synthesized through a one-step spin coating method, as shown in Fig. 1(a). The control films without KBr are referred to as 3D perovskites. For 0D/3D perovskites, a certain amount KBr was incorporated into the perovskite precursor to promote the formation of the 0D Cs4−xKxPbBr6 phase. The diverse connectivity of PbX6 octahedron in the three-dimensional space produces diversiform species of perovskites possessing 3D, 2D, 1D, and 0D structures.29Fig. 1(b) depicts the schematic structures of 3D and 0D perovskite phases. CsPbBr3 phase is a 3D perovskite, where the crystal structure is based on the corner-shared PbBr64− octahedra. On the contrary, the Bergerhoff–Schmitz–Dumont-type crystal structure of Cs4PbBr6 makes the Cs+ ions minimize the electronic overlap between adjacent octahedra, resulting in localized states that are confined to the individual octahedra.30 The energy band structures for the pure 0D Cs4PbBr6 and Cs4−xKxPbBr6 were investigated, as shown in Fig. 1(c). The energy levels of 0D Cs4PbBr6 are much deeper than those of 3D CsPbBr3 (conduction band −3.33 eV, valence band −5.67 eV).31 Combined with the DFT calculation, the energy levels of 0D Cs4−xKxPbBr6 are also deeper than those of 3D CsPbBr3, confirming the feasibility of 0D Cs4−xKxPbBr6/3D CsPbBr3 heterostructure formation shown in Fig. 1(d). In the 0D/3D heterostructure perovskite, excitons in 0D perovskites are transferred to 3D phase, and free excited charges in 3D perovskite are confined and not diffused into 0D phase due to the limited carrier transfer. Thus, it is hypothesized that radiative recombination in 3D phase would boost due to the increase in electron and hole density for 3D phase in the carrier centralization structure.

GIXRD was conducted to investigate the crystal structure and confirm the formation of 0D/3D perovskite thin films, as shown in Fig. 2(a). For easier reference, the perovskite films with different ratios of KBr will be denoted as K2.5%, K5.0%, K10%, K15%, and K20% (see the Experimental section for details). The diffraction peaks located at 15.3°, 21.7°, 30.7°, 34.5°, 37.7°, and 44.1° are assigned to the (110), (200), (220), (222), (132), and (040) planes, respectively.32–34 Commonly, K+ cation with an intermediate ionic radius (138 pm) can hardly substitute the A-site cation into the perovskite structure.34 Thus, no diffraction peak shift can be observed in the K+ incorporation samples, suggesting that K+ remains outside of the CsPbBr3 perovskite. Furthermore, as the K+ doping concentration increases, two new peaks at around 13.07° and 29.46° appear simultaneously, demonstrating the formation of 0D phase.36,37 The extra CsBr in the precursor will combine with parts of CsPbBr3 to form Cs4PbBr6 phase structure (eqn (1)).38 In this work, as the addition of extra KBr is adopted, the newly formed phase is a locally disordered 0D Cs4−xKxPbBr6 phase (eqn (2)).32,36,39–41 3CsBr + CsPbBr3 → Cs4PbBr6(1) (3 − x)CsBr + xKBr+ CsPbBr3 → Cs4−xKxPbBr6(2)The absorption properties of the 3D CsPbBr3 perovskite films and 0D/3D perovskite films were characterized by UV-visible absorption measurement, as depicted in Fig. 2(b). A slight absorption band was observed around 315 nm stemming from the 1S0 → 3P1 transition of Pb2+ centres in the Cs4PbBr6 0D phase, as has been reported by Nikl and coworkers.35,37,42 The absorption spectra thus further confirm that the excess KBr addition contributes to the formation of 0D Cs4−xKxPbBr6.41 The observed large bandgap also proves the DFT calculation results and our hypothesis for the carrier centralization structure formation between 3D and 0D perovskite phase.

To better understand the structural changes upon 0D/3D perovskite heterostructure construction, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and fast Fourier transform (FFT) for the corresponding area were carried out. The samples for TEM measurement were prepared by spin coating the perovskite precursor directly on the carbon support copper grids. In the control sample (Fig. 2(c)), the interplanar spacing of 2.95 Å corresponds to the (200) plane of CsPbBr3.43 For the K15% 0D/3D heterostructure perovskite film (Fig. 2(d)), the lattice spaces of 2.95 Å and 3.46 Å can be assigned to the CsPbBr3 (200) and Cs4PbBr6 (024) lattice planes, confirming the existence of different perovskite phases.32 The FFT result for the control sample shows diffraction spots corresponding to (200), (210) and (410) planes. For the K15% 0D/3D heterostructure perovskite, the diffraction spots of (100), (110) and (210) planes can be assigned to CsPbBr3. Moreover, diffraction spots corresponding to the interplanar spacing of (312) and (024) planes of 0D phase are also observed. These results further confirmed the coexistence of 3D and 0D phases in the K15% 0D/3D perovskite film.
The morphology of perovskite thin films is another crucial factor governing the performance of PeLEDs. Field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) was used to characterize the morphology of the perovskite thin films. The 3D CsPbBr3 perovskite showed poor film morphology, with a large number of pinholes and cracks compared to 0D/3D perovskite films (Fig. 3(a)). These improvements for film morphology can achieve better charge injection balance and device performance. As seen, the average grain size becomes smaller (Fig. S9, ESI†) for the K15 0D/3D perovskite. Furthermore, benefiting from the construction of 0D/3D heterostructure, it also reduces the RMS roughness of the perovskite films, as shown in Fig. 3(g). Quan et al. reported that the cubic CsPbBr3 nanocrystal is embedded in a 0D Cs4PbBr6 matrix without practical strain on the nanocrystals.38 Herein, the 0D Cs4−xKxPbBr6 has the same hexagonal phase as the pure Cs4PbBr6. Therefore, combined with the TEM result, the 0D phase might be in situ formed around the 3D CsPbBr3 lattice as a wrapping layer, suppressing the grain growth and passivating the defects in the grain boundary.19,44 Those all will contribute to the efficient radiative recombination that will be discussed below.

Normally, this charge carrier confinement structure is an advantage in terms of optical properties. First, the steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy technique was performed on the as-synthesized 3D and 0D/3D CsPbBr3 perovskite films. Fig. 4(a) shows that all the perovskite films exhibited intense and narrow PL spectra that peaked at around 520–530 nm. The reduced domain size of the perovskite crystallites is also evident from the blue-shift PL peaks. The steady-state PL intensity increases as the KBr amount increases from 0 to 15% with respect to PbBr2. The PLQY of the as-synthesized CsPbBr3 perovskite films was measured following the method reported by de Mello et al. to determine the influence of charge carrier confinement.45 Surprisingly, in CsPbBr3 perovskite film with 15% KBr addition forming the 0D/3D perovskite heterostructures, the PLQY of ∼35% is obtained, which is over two times larger than that of the control sample, as depicted in the inset of Fig. 4(a). In general, the nonradiative recombination centres are concentrated around the defects in the grain boundaries. Thus, the films with large grain sizes should have better optical performance due to the fewer grain boundaries. However, the as-synthesized films with smaller grain sizes possess a higher PL intensity and PLQY. These results imply that the defects effectively passivated in the grain boundaries, benefiting from the 0D Cs4−xKxPbBr6 phases surrounding the CsPbBr3. After light or electrical excitation, the electrons and holes in 0D phase are partially transferred to the narrower bandgap domain due to the energy transfer channels in the 0D/3D perovskite heterostructure. The density of electrons and holes in the 3D domain can be increased, thus resulting in enhanced PL emission.31,46

(e) TA spectra and (f) dynamics (probing the peaks of bleaching) of the 3D CsPbBr3 and K15% 0D/3D heterostructure perovskite film. 
Next, time-resolved PL (TRPL) measurement was conducted to obtain more insight into the radiative and non-radiative recombination process in the 0D/3D CsPbBr3 perovskite films. The longest emission lifetime (with an average lifetime of 83.4 ns) was observed in the K15% 0D/3D heterostructure perovskite sample, as shown in Fig. 4b and Table S1 (ESI†). The prolonged carrier lifetimes for 0D/3D perovskite films could be due to the reduced trap density and suppressed non-radiative recombination, which agree well with the increased PL intensity, as mentioned before. As seen in Table S1 (ESI†), the fraction of τ2 (A2) decreases first and then increases with the increase of KBr amount. At the same time, the trend of the fraction of τ3 (A3) is opposite that of A2. The declined A2 indicates less trap-assisted recombination at grain boundaries, suggesting that the formation of 0D phase can effectively passivate defects, and thus the charge capture by defects can be reduced. The increased A3 manifests more radiative recombination inside the 0D/3D perovskite, ultimately contributing to EL efficiency. A large number of free charges diffusing in the 3D perovskite are suppressed and recombine with the opposite charge remaining in the grain for the recombination. Thus, the charge confinement increases the opportunity for electron and hole recombination, enhancing the radiative recombination in 3D phase for emission.22 This proves that the formation of 0D/3D mixed dimensional perovskite heterostructure can maintain the charge in 3D phase and not suffer from trapping at the grain boundaries, which facilitates more efficient radiative recombination in 3D phase.
The evolution of PL intensity with temperature can reflect the stability of the photogenerated excitons. Fig. 4(c and d) plots the integrated PL intensity as a function of temperature for the 3D CsPbBr3 and K15% 0D/3D perovskite film samples. As the temperature decreases from 300 K, the integrated PL intensity first increases, then decreases as the temperature further reduces. More intense PL is expected at a lower temperature, benefiting from the suppressed phonon-assisted non-radiative recombination.47 Thus, a reduction in PL intensity at a lower temperature is rarely observed. The negative thermal quenching phenomenon mechanism has been explained by shallow trap states located near the edge of the bandgap. The corresponding exciton binding energy (Ej) is extracted through a combined exciton-trap model:48,49  where I0 represents the intensity at 0 K, I(T) is the integrated PL intensity at a finite temperature, kB is the Boltzmann constant, Ej is the exciton binding energy, and Eq is the ionization energy of the trap state. Parameters D1 and C1 are proportionality factors. The detailed fitting parameters are shown in Table S2 (ESI†). The fitted exciton binding energies Ej of the 3D CsPbBr3 perovskite and K15%, 0D/3D heterostructure perovskite films are 56.36 and 64.20 meV, respectively. The K15% 0D/3D heterostructure perovskite films possess higher exciton binding energies and are expected to achieve better-performing PeLEDs.30
Further, transient absorption (TA) was used to investigate the effect of the non-radiative defect states on the recombination dynamics in our CsPbBr3 and K15% 0D/3D CsPbBr3 heterostructure perovskite films (Fig. 4(e)). Both TA spectra show an identical negative signal at around 516 nm, corresponding to the exciton bleaching. Compared with the control sample, the dynamic of bleach recovery for the K15% 0D/3D heterostructure perovskite film sample is much slower, indicating the excitons are less likely to be trapped by the defects. Furthermore, the transition dynamics for bleach peaks of the 3D and 0D/3D perovskites were compared (Fig. 4(f)), which also demonstrate the reduction of the defect. This result is consistent with TRPL observations that radiative recombination for luminescence is enhanced. Also, to evaluate the defect state of the 3D CsPbBr3 and 0D/3D heterostructure perovskite films, a space-charge-limited-current (SCLC) method was employed by fabricating hole-only devices in the structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/Perovskite/MoO3/Ag (Fig. S8, ESI†). The trap density of K15% 0D/3D perovskite thin films is estimated to be 6.800 × 1017 cm−3, which is lower than 3D perovskite (1.079 × 1018 cm−3). The reduction in trap density is in accordance with the above TRPL and TA observations.
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed to identify the composition and chemical states of the as-synthesized perovskite films. The spectra were calibrated using the maximum of the adventitious C 1s signal at 284.8 eV. The presence of K was confirmed from the deconvolution of K 2p XPS spectra (Fig. 5(a)). Two different peaks centred at around 292.5 eV and 295.5 eV are observed, corresponding to K 2p3/2 and K 2p1/2 groups, respectively. Obviously, no characteristic peaks of K are detected in the spectra of the control sample. The intensity of K 2p peaks also increases with the content of K, which can also be determined by the atomic ratios of Cs to K derived from the XPS spectra. It is noteworthy that the XPS peaks of K shift to the lower binding energy direction in the low-dose KBr samples. However, when the concentration of KBr is above 15%, the XPS peaks of K 2p shift to the higher binding energy direction. We suppose that the further increase of KBr addition may lead to a more unreacted KBr phase, and the unreacted KBr possesses higher K 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 binding energies at around 292.9 eV and 295.8 eV, respectively.50 Thus, it will cause the binding energy of K 2p to slightly shift to the higher binding energy direction. Interestingly, distinct peak shift in binding energy was also observed in the case of Cs 3d (0.6 eV), Pb 4f (0.6 eV), and Br (0.5 eV), comparing to the K15% 0D/3D heterostructure perovskite film sample (Fig. 5(b)–(d)). The shifts in binding energy are clear evidence for the change in chemical bonding properties between cations and anions after 0D/3D perovskite heterostructure construction. Phase stability of the perovskites is determined by the volumetric ratio between PbX6 octahedra and A-site cations.51 The increase in the cationic charge of lead ions will contribute to tightening halides and shrinking the PbX6 octahedral volume, leading to the enhancement of phase stability. This observation implies that 0D/3D heterostructure has a positive effect on the 3D phase stability enhancement.

The green PeLEDs were fabricated to study the effect of the one-step self-organized 0D Cs4−xKxPbBr6/3D CsPbBr3 heterostructure carrier confinement strategy on photoelectric performance. Fig. 6(a) shows the schematic diagram and cross-sectional SEM image of the PeLED device structure, which consists of glass/indium tin oxide (ITO)/PEDOT:PSS/Perovskite/1,3,5-tris(1-phenyl-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl)benzene (TPBi)/LiF/Al. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) and UV-visible spectroscopy (Fig. S11, ESI†) were employed to determine the energy level of the corresponding perovskite films. The corresponding schematics of the flat-band energy level diagram of the device are shown in Fig. 6(b). The current density–voltage (J–V), luminance–voltage (V–L), current efficiency–voltage (CE–V), EQE–voltage (EQE–V), and EQE–current density (EQE–CD) curves of the 3D CsPbBr3 and 0D/3D heterostructure-based PeLEDs are shown in Fig. 6(c)–(f), respectively. As expected, the device based on the CsPbBr3/Cs4−xKxPbBr6 heterostructure EML shows significantly improved performance. According to the J–V–L curves shown in Fig. 6(c), the K15% and K20% 0D/3D heterostructure PeLEDs exhibit the lowest turn-on voltage around 2.8 V, which is slightly higher than the optical bandgap of the emitting material. The turn-on voltage indicates the lowest voltage required for radiative recombination in the PeLEDs. Additionally, the 0D/3D perovskite PeLEDs based on K15% perovskite film achieved the maximum luminance (39400 cd m−2), which is around three times higher than that of the pristine 3D CsPbBr3 (12500 cd m−2).

Apart from the I–V–L characteristics, the optoelectronic conversion efficiency of these PeLEDs was also measured. The efficiency of all devices based on 0D/3D perovskite is significantly enhanced compared to that of the control. The maximum current efficiency increased to 43.7 cd A−1 from 8.2 cd A−1, obtained for the K15 0D/3D perovskite films (Fig. 6(d)). Meanwhile, the maximum EQE significantly increased from 2.1% to 12.8%, benefiting from the preservation of high PLQY for the K15 0D/3D perovskite film (Fig. 6(e) and (f)). The combination of improved PLQY and low trap density contributes to the improvement of PeLED efficiency, indicating the effective charge carrier recombination in 3D perovskite phase for the 0D/3D carrier confinement heterostructure. The details of the 3D CsPbBr3 and 0D/3D heterostructure-based PeLEDs are summarized in Table 1. Furthermore, the EL spectra reveal a slight blue shift to 516 nm, compared with the PL emission at 527 nm for the K15% 0D/3D heterostructure perovskite films, shown in Fig. 6(g).52 These fabricated devices demonstrated symmetric and narrow EL peaks with a full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of 20 nm. As the bias voltage increases from 3.4 to 7 V, the EL peak position and FWHM remain unchanged, suggesting high color purity. According to the CIE 1931 standard color-matching functions, the emitted green K15% 0D/3D heterostructure PeLEDs can be indexed by (x, y) chromaticity coordinates as (0.11, 0.77), given in the inset of Fig. 6(g). Moreover, in order to investigate the photocurrent hysteresis in our PeLEDs, current density–voltage (J–V) curves in various scanning directions were ran and are shown in Fig. 6(h). It was found that the K15% 0D/3D heterostructure PeLEDs show a relatively low hysteresis, demonstrating that the ion migration can be suppressed.

Conclusions
In summary, we report a facile approach to form 0D/3D mixed-dimensional self-assembled heterostructure perovskite film to significantly improve the efficiency of CsPbBr3-based PeLEDs. By adding KBr into the perovskite precursor, a Cs4−xKxPbBr6/CsPbBr3 perovskite type-I heterostructure film can be achieved. With this unique heterostructure, grain boundary defect passivation can be observed, which is responsible for the improved PLQY. Moreover, the formation of this 0D/3D perovskite heterostructure is conducive to confine the charge carriers and boost the recombination efficiency of electrons and holes in the 3D phase. More importantly, the PeLEDs utilizing 15% KBr-based 0D/3D heterostructure as emitter layer exhibited a high brightness of 39400 cd m−2 and a relatively high external quantum efficiency of 12.8%, which is more than six times higher than the pristine one (2.1%). Our results reveal the relationship between 0D/3D carrier centralization heterostructure and PeLED device performance. The heterostructure formation serves as a feasible and effective tool for developing another CsPbBr3-based perovskite heterostructure, and also can be applied to other potential perovskite systems to break the bottleneck of PeLED efficiencies further.
