    , Accepted 22nd June 2018First published on 28th June 2018AbstractAiming at tedious preparation procedures for 2D porous graphitic carbon nitride (2DPCN) nanosheets, a one-step thermal polymerization method based on a supramolecular precursor has been developed. As-prepared 2DPCNs exhibit enlarged specific surface areas with rich reaction sites, better crystallinity, stronger visible-light harvesting capability, aligned energy levels and faster charge transfer. A superior photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate of 220 μmol h−1 under visible-light (λ > 420 nm) irradiation, has been achieved.

Our one-step thermal polymerization method based on a supramolecular precursor provides a new way to develop C3N4 photocatalysts with different morphologies and better photoelectric properties.
Introduction
Developing highly efficient photocatalysts has drawn worldwide attention for their potential application in solar energy conversion to chemical energy.1,2 Since Wang's pioneering work on graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) was reported in 2009, this kind of fascinating metal-free photocatalyst has been applied in water splitting, pollutant degradation, carbon dioxide reduction and other photocatalytic reactions, due to its adjustable visible-light activity, good stability and low cost.3–5 However, bulk g-C3N4 (BCN) still exhibits a rather low photocatalytic activity because of its small specific surface area with few photocatalytic active sites, low carrier transfer ability and fast photo-generated carrier recombination.4 Hence, in order to address these issues, different methodologies including morphological engineering,6–8 doping,9–12 or constructing heterostructures,13–15 have been developed.
As we know, photocatalytic reactions mainly take place on the surface of the photocatalysts, the photocatalytic efficiency is thus closely related to the morphology and microstructure of the materials. 2D materials with extremely small thickness, in nanometer or even sub-nanometer scales, exhibit attractive advantages for improving the photocatalytic efficiency, such as larger specific surface areas to provide more reactive sites and shorter carrier diffusion lengths to restrain the recombination, in comparison with corresponding bulk materials (i.e. N-doped TiO2 and Ba5Ta4O15).16,17 g-C3N4 is a graphite-like layered polymeric semiconductor, which has strong covalent C–N bonds instead of C–C bonds in each layer and weak Van der Waals forces between layers.18 Obviously, it is desirable to prepare ultrathin 2D g-C3N4 materials for higher photocatalytic efficiency.19,20 Liu et al. used a direct thermal oxidation “etching” method toward BCN in air to prepare 2 nm-thick g-C3N4 nanosheets, which possessed a high specific surface area of 306 m2 g−1, a larger bandgap by 0.2 eV and a prolonged carrier lifetime.21 Aiming at low-yield and time-consuming issues, Wu et al. reported a one-step method by using dicyandiamide and NH4Cl as raw materials, which can release gases to blow dicyandiamide-derived polymers and afford large quantity and high quality g-C3N4 nanosheets with an average hydrogen evolution rate of 450 μmol h−1 under the illumination of a 300 W Xe lamp.22 Besides, porous structures can also enhance the specific surface area and provide more active sites for various catalytic reactions. Therefore, different porous g-C3N4 photocatalysts have also been developed, such as ordered and hollow g-C3N4, large pore three dimensional cage-type mesoporous C3N4 semiconductors and so on, which exhibited better photocatalytic activity.6,23–26
Considering the advantages of the above two morphologies, 2D porous g-C3N4 (2DPCN) nanosheets are supposed to bring about impressive photocatalytic efficiency. In fact, a few works on this kind of photocatalyst have already been reported.27,28 Qu et al. employed a solvothermal exfoliation method to obtain atomically thin mesoporous g-C3N4 nanomeshes based on freeze-drying assembled dicyandiamide as the precursor.29 Yang et al. adopted a thermal treatment toward BCN under an NH3 atmosphere to afford holey C3N4 nanosheets with carbon vacancies, which exhibited an improved photocatalytic performance by about 20-fold.30 Xing et al. prepared macroscopic foam-like holey ultrathin g-C3N4 nanosheets by self-modification of polymeric melon units through long-time thermal treatment of BCN in air.31 Xu et al. synthesized porous g-C3N4 nanosheets by a liquid exfoliation method via probe sonication.32 Chen et al. reported a 2D porous g-C3N4 nanosheet/N-doped graphene/layered MoS2 ternary nanojunction, which exhibited better photodegradation activity toward MB.33 Fan et al. obtained holey structured g-C3N4 thin sheets with oxygen-doped edges by BCN oxidization and subsequent exfoliation.34 However, these synthetic methods usually require tedious procedures, such as a long-time solvothermal reaction or thermal exfoliation toward BCN, which especially limit large-scale application of photocatalysts. In addition, as-prepared photocatalysts still suffer from larger bandgaps, disadvantageous to visible-light utilization.29–31
In this regard, a simple one-step thermal polymerization method has been developed for 2DPCN photocatalysts by using a supramolecular precursor, which was obtained by an HCl assisted melamine aqueous solution hydrothermal process (Scheme 1). The as-prepared 2DPCN exhibits an enlarged specific surface area, better crystallinity, and an extended visible-light absorption range. Based on a 50 mg photocatalyst, a photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate of up to 220 μmol h−1 was achieved under visible-light (λ > 420 nm) irradiation in the presence of triethanolamine as the sacrificial agent. In the meantime, an apparent quantum yield of 1.3% at 490 nm was also obtained. Further investigation reveals that the remarkable photocatalytic activity of 2DPCN is mainly assigned to its more exposed active sites and faster interfacial charge transfer/migration due to the kind of 2D porous structure.

Experimental
Materials
Melamine (CP), triethanolamine (AR) and chloroplatinic acid hexahydrate (AR) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. Hydrochloric acid (37 wt%, AR) was purchased from Xilong Chemical Co. Ltd. All chemicals and reagents were used as received without further purification.
Preparation of 2DPCN
Melamine (2.0 g) was dissolved in 200 mL of deionized water, then, 2.1 mL of HCl was added into the melamine solution while continuously stirring for 30 min. The clear solution was transferred into an autoclave with a Teflon liner and heated at 180 °C for 10 h. The mixture was filtered to remove the solvent; the precipitate was washed with deionized water and ethanol for several times, and finally dried at 60 °C in a vacuum oven overnight. The resultant solid was heated to 650 °C for 2 h under a flow of nitrogen with a heating rate of 15 °C min−1 to afford the 2DPCN. The yield is ca. 6% based on melamine.
Preparation of BCN
For comparison, BCN powder was also synthesized by the thermal-polymerization method.11 In detail, 1 g of melamine was directly heated to 650 °C for 2 h under a flow of nitrogen with a heating rate of 15 °C min−1. The as-prepared BCN was ground into homogeneous powder.
Characterization
XRD patterns of the as-prepared samples were collected on a powder X-ray diffractometer (Cu Kα radiation source, D8, Bruker). Morphologies of the samples were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (FEI-SEM, XL 30 S-FEG) and transmission electron microscopy (FEI/Tecnai G2 F20 S-TWIN TMP). The specific surface areas and the average porosity distribution of as-prepared samples were obtained by using the N2 adsorption–desorption method using an ASAP 2020 apparatus, Micromeritics, and were calculated via the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) was performed on a TENSOR 27 spectrometer (Bruker). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out on an ESCALAB 250Xi. Steady-state photoluminescence spectra were obtained under the excitation of 380 nm (Thermo Fisher). UV-visible (UV-vis) diffuse reflectance spectra were recorded on a UV-vis spectrophotometer (UV-3600, Shimadzu) equipped with an integrating sphere, then converted into absorption spectra by Kubelka–Munk transformation. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy was performed on an ESR spectrometer (JES-FA 200, JEOL) with a modulation frequency of 100 kHz and a microwave power of 1.0 mW. The transient photocurrent property was investigated in a three-electrode cell by using an electrochemical analyser (Model-650A), in which the samples coated on FTO glass act as the working electrode, a Pt wire as the counter electrode, and Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode. A 300 W xenon arc lamp light was chosen as the light source, while a 0.2 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution was adopted as the electrolyte at a 0.5 V bias. The working electrode was prepared by dropping the catalyst suspension on the FTO glass till it dried naturally. The suspension was prepared by dispersing 5 mg of the samples in a mixture of 500 μL of H2O, 500 μL of ethanol and 5 μL of Nafion solution (5%).
Photocatalytic activity test
The photocatalytic hydrogen production was carried out in a Pyrex top-irradiation reaction cell connected to a closed gas circulation and evacuation system. For each reaction, 50 mg of the catalyst powder was dispersed in 100 mL of an aqueous solution containing 10 mL of triethanolamine as the sacrificial agent. 3 wt% Pt was loaded on the surface of the catalysts by in situ photodeposition of H2PtCl6. The reactant solution was evacuated several times to completely remove the air prior to irradiation under a 300 W Xe lamp (PLS-SXE300, Trusttech) with a long pass cut-off filter (λ > 420 nm) and a water filter. The temperature of the reactant solution was maintained at 0 °C by a flow of cooling liquid during the photocatalytic reaction. The produced gases were analyzed using an on-line gas chromatograph equipped with a thermal conductive detector and a 5A molecular sieve column while using argon as the carrier gas. The photocatalytic activities were compared using the average hydrogen evolution rate in the first 5 h. The apparent quantum yield (AQY) for H2 evolution was obtained by using a monochromatic LED lamp with band pass filters of 405, 420, 450, 470, 490, 520 and 578 nm. The irradiation area was controlled at 3 × 3 cm2. Depending on the amount of hydrogen gas produced from the photocatalytic reaction in an average of 1 h, the AQY was estimated as follows:  
Results and discussion
For g-C3N4 photocatalysts, melamine as the starting material is usually adapted in the thermal polymerization method; however, high-temperature treatment would lead to a dense g-C3N4.3–5 Recently, a supramolecular precursor from the self-assembly of melamine and cyanuric acid was reported that enables the morphology to be retained well after calcination. In addition, the sublimation and/or pyrolysis of melamine and g-C3N4 is beneficial to the formation of the porous structure.11,12,23,35,36 Here, a one-step thermal polymerization method is developed based on a supramolecular precursor, which was derived from the hydrothermal reaction of melamine in the existence of HCl. The overall synthetic procedure is illustrated in Scheme 1. The structures of the samples are verified using X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns. As shown in Fig. 1a, there are two obvious XRD diffraction peaks centered at 12.8° and 27.7° for (100) and (002), respectively, similar to those of the BCN. That is, the 2DPCN still possesses typical graphitic carbon nitride characteristics.3,4 In addition, a small peak at 21.6° is detected. When melamine is calcined at a low temperature (under 500 °C), this peak can also be detected and the intensity increases with the decrease in temperature since low temperatures restrain the polymerization of melon in C3N4. Hence, this peak is supposed to be due to the defective condensation of the melon structures.4,18 However, the peak intensity of 2DPCN is lower than that of the BCN, indicating a less melon structure in the 2DPCN.

Fig. 1b presents typical FT-IR spectra of the obtained samples. Similar FT-IR spectra of the 2DPCN and BCN are observed, also in good agreement with those reported previously.19 The sharp peak at 810 cm−1 is assigned to the typical breathing mode of s-triazine rings. Several strong peaks located between 1700 and 1200 cm−1 belong to the skeletal stretching vibration of aromatic C–N heterocycles, while broad peaks in the range of 3400–3000 cm−1 are ascribed to the stretching vibrations of N–H and O–H due to incomplete polymerization or/and adsorbed water.23 However, a new peak centered at 2182 cm−1 is found in the spectrum of 2DPCN, which is assigned to the asymmetric stretching vibration of a CN triple bond (inset in Fig. 1b). The existence of a CN group in 2DPCN is supposed to increase the electron delocalization and adjust band structures, beneficial for visible-light absorption and photon-generated carrier separation.37,38
The morphologies of the supramolecular precursor and 2DPCN are studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The precursor exhibits a micrometer rod-like structure (Fig. 2a). This supramolecular precursor was further calcined at 650 °C for 2 h to afford the 2DPCN. As shown in Fig. 2b, the 2DPCN exhibits a uniform nanosheet morphology, and the thickness of the 2DPCN nanosheets is estimated to be 50–75 nm (Fig. 2c). The high-resolution SEM image in Fig. 2d clearly indicates that this 2D nanosheet is decorated with some pores with diameters of 30–70 nm. In addition, the TEM images in Fig. 3a and b further reveal that the 2DPCN has a uniform 2D nanosheet structure, which is decorated with mesopores with sizes of 5–50 nm, in good agreement with the SEM images. For comparison, the BCN derived from melamine as the raw material, exhibits a bulk material feature (Fig. 3d), which was calcined by following the same procedure as that for the 2DPCN. However, for the BCN, no obvious pores are seen in the TEM image even at high magnification (Fig. 3e). Obviously, the nanosheet morphology and mesopore structure of the 2DPCN can increase the specific surface area. Fig. 3c and f present the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) images of 2DPCN and BCN, respectively. The SAED circular fringes with spot patterns of 2DPCN are marked with corresponding indexes,39 indicating its growth into a polycrystalline form. However, the SAED pattern of BCN only shows an unsharp amorphous ring. It is thus suggested that, the 2DPCN possesses a higher crystallinity degree than BCN. It is known that the higher crystallinity can improve the charge transfer and suppress the charge recombination, which may be beneficial to the photocatalytic activity of 2DPCN.36

In order to understand the formation process of the 2DPCN, different calcination temperatures toward the supramolecular precursor were used. As shown in Fig. S1a,† the sample calcined at 450 °C mainly exhibits a rod-like structure with small holes in the central section of the microrod precursor. When the calcination temperature rises to 550 °C, a tubular structure is observed (Fig. S1b†). Further increasing the calcination temperature to 600 °C leads to both nanosheets and tubes, as shown in Fig. S1c.† Based on the above change in the microstructure of the as-prepared samples, the formation process of the 2DPCN is suggested. In the calcination process of the rod-structured precursor, a tubular structure is formed at first. With the calcination temperature increasing, more g-C3N4 is pyrolyzed until the tube wall is thin enough to not hold the complete tube structure. Finally, the tube would break up into 2D nanosheets. Further investigation reveals that, for precursor solutions with different HCl concentrations (0.075, 0.1 and 0.15 M), similar 2D porous nanosheet structures can also be obtained after calcination, as shown in Fig. S1d–f.† Here, the 2DPCN sample with 0.125 M HCl is taken as an example for further investigation. Furthermore, this one-step thermal polymerization method based on the supramolecular precursor, is supposed to be suitable for the uniform and large scale preparation of 2DPCN.
Nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms were employed to demonstrate the specific surface areas and pore size distributions of the 2DPCN and BCN samples. As shown in Fig. 4a, both samples exhibit typical type IV isotherms with an H-type hysteresis loop, suggesting mesoporous characteristics. And the pore size distribution of the 2DPCN determined by the BJH method shows a relatively higher content of pores in the entire range with respect to the BCN (see the inset of Fig. 4a). The specific surface area and pore volume of 2DPCN are 50.2 m2 g−1 and 0.25 cm3 g−1, respectively, larger than those of the BCN (14.6 m2 g−1 and 0.13 cm3 g−1). In this work, the pore formation and pore volume enlargement are mainly due to the greater number of lateral edges of 2DPCN, which can provide more reduction reaction activity sites for water splitting.28 As we know, a larger specific surface area can enlarge the contact probability between the photocatalyst and the reactants, which is crucial to heterogeneous catalysis.24,25,40 Obviously, both the enlarged specific surface area and lateral edges will be beneficial to photocatalytic reactions.

In addition, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is employed to determine the chemical environment of 2DPCN and BCN. As shown in Fig. S2,† only three elements, C, N, and O, are investigated in the survey spectra. According to the higher-resolution spectra of C 1s, N 1s and Cl 2p in Fig. 4b and c, no obvious changes in the binding energies of C 1s and N 1s are observed for 2DPCN and BCN, and two C 1s peaks are located at 288.2 and 284.6 eV, which are related to the sp2-hybridized carbon in the aromatic ring (N–CN) and an impure carbon such as graphitic carbon (CC), respectively. It is clear that the degree of carbon impurity in 2DPCN is relatively lower than that in the BCN. The N 1s spectrum can be deconvoluted into three peaks centered at 398.6, 399.9 and 401.2 eV (Fig. 4c), which belong to sp2-hybridized nitrogen in the triazine ring (C–NC), the tertiary nitrogen (N–(C)3) and the anime group (C–N–H), respectively. And the peak at 404.4 eV is assigned to the positive charge localization in the heterocycles.5,18 Although HCl is involved in the precursor solution, no obvious Cl 2p signal is found, indicating that the Cl element is not introduced into the 2DPCN, as shown in Fig. 4d. In addition, the C:N ratios of BCN and 2DPCN are estimated using XPS results, that is, the C:N ratio of 2DPCN is 0.72, closer to the theoretical ratio of g-C3N4 (0.75) than that of BCN (0.67), suggesting that fewer residual amine groups are involved in 2DPCN.28 Together with the XRD (Fig. 1a) and SAED (Fig. 3c and f) results, the 2DPCN shows a more perfect g-C3N4 crystalline structure than that of BCN. This further confirms that our one-step thermal polymerization method has the superiority in preparing high quality 2DPCNs.

Fig. 5a presents the electron paramagnetic resonance measurements (EPR) of 2DPCN and BCN. The two samples exhibit a Lorentzian line with a g value of 2.0031, which is assigned to the unpaired electrons on the sp2-carbon atoms within the π-conjugated aromatic ring.31 Furthermore, an extra peak at g = 2.0049 is found for the 2DPCN, suggesting that the existence of CN groups in the 2DPCN can extend the π-conjugated system, which is in good agreement with the FT-IR spectrum (Fig. 1b).38,41 As mentioned above, the CN groups can provide a positive effect on photocatalytic reactions.

Electronic band structures of the 2DPCN and BCN are investigated using UV-visible spectra and XPS valence band (VB) spectra. In Fig. 5b, in comparison with BCN, 2DPCN shows an absorption increase in the wavelength range of 420–600 nm, primarily due to the multiple reflections of incident light within the porous structure.28,29 In the meantime, the corresponding bandgap decreases from 2.68 to 2.23 eV, which is estimated from the Tauc plot (inset of Fig. 5b). On the one hand, a higher polymerization degree, confirmed by the XRD and SAED results (Fig. 1a and 3c and f), is supposed to be beneficial to the bandgap decrease.11,42 On the other hand, the existence of CN groups in 2DPCN indicates some N vacancies, which can also reduce the bandgap of g-C3N4.37,38 Although 2DPCN exhibits a relatively smaller bandgap, it is still larger than that suitable for splitting water (1.23 eV) even with the overpotential involved. Here, with the aid of the XPS VB spectra in Fig. 5c, a 0.09 eV higher VB edge for the 2DPCN than that for BCN is estimated. Considering the 0.45 eV decrease in the bandgap, the conduction band (CB) of the 2DPCN is thus downshifted by 0.36 eV compared with that of BCN, as shown in Fig. 5d. On the one hand, some decrease in the bandgap of the 2DPCN can lead to the extension of the visible-light absorption range. Meanwhile, the higher VB and lower CB of the 2DPCN can still possess suitable energy levels for water splitting. Generally, the CB of g-C3N4 prepared by the direct thermal polymerization of melamine, is about −1.1 eV vs. NHE.4 Obviously, the CB of 2DPCN still has enough reduction ability to release H2. Therefore, the 2DPCN would be an ideal photocatalyst for visible-light photocatalytic hydrogen evolution.
The photocatalytic hydrogen evolution properties of the as-prepared 2DPCNs are tested under visible-light (λ > 420 nm) irradiation by using Pt as the co-catalyst and triethanolamine as the scavenger agent. The influence of different HCl concentrations in the precursor solutions on the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity is investigated. As shown in Fig. 6a, all the 2DPCN samples show higher photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rates than BCN, and the highest photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate is obtained when the HCl concentration is 0.125 M. The effect of the heating rates on the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity is also investigated (Fig. 6b), and the 15 °C min−1 heating rate is found to be the optimum in this work. The highest hydrogen evolution rate of 2DPCN (0.125 M) is 220 μmol h−1, six times higher than that of BCN (34 μmol h−1), as shown in Fig. 6b. Fig. 6c shows the wavelength dependent apparent quantum yield (AQY) values of the 2DPCN catalyst for H2 evolution under various monochromatic light irradiations, where the variation tendency of the AQY curves corresponds well with the UV/vis light absorption spectrum. The AQY value of 2DPCN is estimated to be about 1.3% at 490 nm. And when irradiated at 520 nm, the AQY value can still reach 0.7%, suggesting that the photocatalytic activity of 2DPCN could be extended to green light. Besides, stronger fluorescence quenching and higher photocurrent response for the 2DPCN (Fig. 6d) are also observed, indicating that the charge recombination was substantially suppressed and the photo-generated carrier mobility was faster, both of which are beneficial to highly efficient photocatalytic H2 evolution. Cycling tests are carried out to explore the photocatalytic stability of the 2DPCN. As shown in Fig. S3a in the ESI,† it is found that after four reaction cycles, the 2DPCN can still maintain a high-efficiency photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate. In addition, no obvious difference in the XRD and FT-IR spectra of the 2DPCN samples is found before and after the photocatalytic reaction, indicating that the 2DPCN exhibits good stability (Fig. S3b and c†).

Conclusions
A one-step thermal polymerization method based on a supramolecular precursor has been developed for 2DPCNs. This kind of 2D porous structure is favourable for light harvesting and exhibits rich reaction activity sites. A photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate of up to 220 μmol h−1 was achieved under visible-light (λ > 420 nm), and an apparent quantum yield of 1.3% at 490 nm was also obtained, indicating that the photocatalytic activity of the 2DPCN can be extended to green light. Further investigation reveals that the remarkable photocatalytic activity of the 2DPCN is mainly attributed to its extended visible-light absorption range, better crystallinity, aligned energy levels and relatively higher specific surface area. More important is that this kind of 2D porous structure can facilitate interfacial charge transfer/migration. This one-step thermal polymerization method based on a supramolecular precursor opens a new way to improve the preparation, structure and photoelectric properties of 2DPCNs for highly efficient photocatalytic activity.
