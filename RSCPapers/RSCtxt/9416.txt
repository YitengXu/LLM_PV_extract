    , Accepted 13th December 2013First published on 16th December 2013AbstractWe demonstrated tungsten carbide (WC) as an efficient anode buffer layer for a high-performance inverted organic solar cell. The devices based on active layers comprised of either poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) or poly[[4,8-bis[(2-ethylhexyl)oxy]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl][3-fluoro-2-[(2-ethylhexyl)carbonyl]thieno[3,4-b]thiophenediyl]] (PTB7) mixed with fullerene derivatives have achieved power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 3.83% and 8.04%, respectively. The WC layer was deposited onto the active layer from a surfactant-free nanoparticle alcohol solution because the buffer layer was well functionalized, removing the requirement for oxygen-plasma or annealing treatment, while simultaneously allowing for optimum photogenerated charge-carrier collection in an inverted structure device. The WC-based device displayed an improved stability performance compared with the MoO3-based one. The anode buffer layer introduced here was easy to implement and compatible with solution processed organic photovoltaics, and therefore applicable for potential cost-effective manufacturing processes.
I. Introduction
Research in organic solar cells has achieved rapid progress in the last two decades by optimizing the morphology of their active layers, designing novel organic molecules and tailoring device structures.1–5 Indium tin oxide (ITO) has been discovered as a ubiquitous transparent electrode material for hole extraction in organic solar cells. However, a direct charge extraction into ITO in an organic solar cell is usually inefficient due to the energetic mismatch between organic molecules and ITO. Therefore, a buffer layer such as poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) has been introduced onto an ITO surface before the active layer deposition, in order to provide a bridge at the interface as well as smoothing the rough ITO film.6,7 However, both the hygroscopic and acidic nature of PEDOT:PSS can result in the degradation of device performances.8,9 In addition, PEDOT:PSS displays a work function of ∼5.1 eV, which is not deep enough to offer a large internal electric field.6 One approach of fabricating an inverted device structure has been developed to circumvent these problems.10 The transition metal oxides such as molybdenum oxide (MoO3),11,12 silver oxide (AgxO),13 chromium oxide (Cr2O3),14 vanadium oxide (V2O5),15 nickel oxide (NiOx),16,17 tungsten oxide (WO3),18–20 and rhenium oxide (ReO3)21 exhibit large work functions, and they are commonly applied as anode buffer layers for the high efficiency collection of photogenerated charge carriers in inverted organic solar cells. Furthermore, relatively stable metal oxide-based devices have been demonstrated.
To the best of our knowledge, the metal oxides discussed above have so far generally been fabricated by vacuum thermal deposition, which may be a drawback for future large-scale all-solution manufacturing processing. Alternatively, various solution-based methods have been investigated to fabricate metal oxide films.12,15,17,22–24 The sol–gel technique has been extensively employed for transition metal oxide films.4,17,25–27 However, most of these methods require post annealing processes to allow the precursors to thermally decompose into metal oxide, which may be incompatible with inverted organic solar cells. Many organic molecules cannot tolerate the relative high temperatures of the annealing process. Alternatively, solutions comprised of metal oxide nanoparticles have been employed before depositing anode films onto active layer films, however, post-annealing is still required to fabricate the hole collection layers.22–24
Tungsten carbide (WC) is a material with specific properties such as high corrosion resistance, electrical conductivity and excellent catalytic activity.28 The extraordinary electronic properties of WC are gained from its ionic contribution characterized by the charge transfer from metal atoms to non-metal ones.29 Those electronic properties lead to the initial state effects including change of the coordination of the substrate atoms, which usually lower the surface potential.30 As a chemical reaction catalyst, it is a potential substitute for expensive noble metals because of its low cost and high catalytic selectivity. The high catalytic activity of WC is ascribed to its positively charged transition metal in the carbide. The direction of charge transfer is from metal to carbon. Recently, WC has been applied as the counter electrode for dye sensitized solar cells, and a comparable performance has been achieved to that of widely-used platinum.31,32
Herein, we demonstrated that the WC layers, fabricated from an alcohol WC nanoparticle suspension, could undertake the role of an efficient anode buffer layer. The devices based on WC layers displayed superior performance compared to those based on thermally evaporated molybdenum oxide (e-MoO3). The WC film could be readily formed onto the film comprised of either poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) or poly[[4,8-bis[(2-ethylhexyl)oxy]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl][3-fluoro-2-[(2-ethylhexl)carbonyl]thieno[3,4-b]thiophenediyl]] (PTB7) mixed with fullerene derivatives by spin-coating. The prepared anode buffer layer did not require any additional thermal treatment for functional hole extraction in the inverted organic solar cell.
II. Experimental
A. Preparation of WC solution
Crystalline WC powder was purchased from CW-Nano Company (Shanghai, China). WC powder could be dispersed in isopropanol (IPA) with a concentration of 5 mg mL−1 by an ultrasonic cell crusher (BILON 92-IID). After high energy processing, the WC suspensions were diluted by IPA for device fabrication.
B. Fabrication and characterization of OPVs
The glass substrate coated with patterned ITO was cleaned thoroughly and then exposed to UV-ozone for 15 min. The sol–gel zinc oxide (ZnO) precursor was deposited onto the ITO substrate and then annealed at 150 °C for 90 min in air. Next, an active layer of P3HT: [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) or PTB7: [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) was cast upon the ZnO buffer layer. The weight ratios of P3HT:PC61BM (in dichlorobenzene) and PTB7:PC71BM (in chlorobenzene with 3% 1,8-diiodineoctdane) were 1:0.8 and 1:1.5, respectively. Subsequently, WC suspensions were deposited onto the active layer by spin-coating, either one, two or three times. Finally, the patterned silver electrode was deposited by thermal evaporation using a Mini-Spectros high vacuum system (Kurt J. Lesker). The device area was 8.25 mm2, restricted by a shadow mask.
C. Characterization of WC solution and films
The UV-vis absorbance and transmittance spectra were recorded on an analytikjena SPECORD S600. Zeta potentials were acquired using a particle size analyser (Malvern Nano-ZS90). X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were carried out using an X-ray powder diffractometer (PANAlytical Empyrean). The topography and the surface potentials were measured by atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Veeco, Multimode V). The film thicknesses were acquired with an Alpha SE spectroscopic ellipsometer (J. A. Woollam). The work function of WC was obtained by pressing WC powder on an indium substrate and measuring by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (KRATOS Analytical). The particle sizes were characterized by a FEI Tecnai G2 F20 transmission electron microscope (TEM). The photoluminescence (PL) lifetime was measured by time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) in air using a HORIBA-fm-2015 for P3HT both with and without WC or e-MoO3. The cross-section HRSEM image was measured using a Zeiss Supra 55. The device performances were characterized under simulated air mass (AM) 1.5 G irradiation at 100 mW cm−2 using a Xe lamp-based solar simulator (Newport 91160). The light intensity was calibrated using a Newport standard silicon solar cell 91150.
III. Results and discussion
A high-intensity ultrasonication method was used to shred WC bulks into nanoparticles. The WC particles displayed a size distribution ranging from 20 nm to 200 nm after high-intensity ultrasonication treatment, as shown in Fig. 1(a) and (b) and Fig. S1(a),† while the WC bulk before treatment was several microns, as shown in Fig. S1(b).† AFM images were recorded to characterize the surface of the nanoparticles. The samples were prepared by spin-coating the WC nanoparticles onto a polished silicon substrate. As shown in Fig. 2(b) and (c), the AFM cross-sectional line profiles displayed heights of a few nm and widths of 40–150 nm, implying that the WC nanoparticles had a smooth surface, which might possess the ability to form uniform films. The corresponding three-dimensional AFM image is shown in Fig. S2.† This material was preferred to lie on a substrate. The preferred orientation was a result of the capillary effect during the spin-coating process.33 The smooth surface was also explained by the different contrasts visible in the TEM image of Fig. 1(a) and S1(c).† The inset in Fig. 1(a) shows the labelled lattice direction corresponding to the (001) planes of WC, which was confirmed by the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) image (inset, Fig. 1(b)).

Notably, after ultrasonication, the WC particles in isopropanol could be well dispersed to form a stable suspension. Fig. 2(d) shows the UV-vis absorption spectra of WC in isopropanol solvent and the inset photograph is the WC solution after ultrasonication with a concentration of ∼0.5 mg mL−1. It was clearly indicated that the suspension exhibited good stability. The small nanoparticles in isopropanol did not show any obvious precipitation in two weeks. To investigate the dispersability of the WC suspensions, the Zeta potentials were measured before and after ultrasonication. As shown in Fig. S3,† the surface potential values of WC nanoparticles changed from an initial −18.3 mV to a final −41.0 mV. The Zeta potential values had approximately doubled after post-treatment. The results indicated that the nanoparticles were highly charged, thereby improving their dispersability in IPA.
X-ray diffraction (XRD) was used to analyse the crystalline structure of the WC. As shown in Fig. S4,† the diffraction peaks at 31.05, 35.22, 47.88, 63.64, 65.33, 72.71, 75.14, 76.70 and 83.68° could be assigned to the (001), (100), (101), (110), (002), (111), (200), (102) and (201) crystal planes, respectively, according to the standard diffraction pattern of bulk WC (no. 89-2727, PDF-2 Database). No crystal transformation was observed after ultrasonication of the hexagonal crystals. The full width at half maximum slightly increased after ultrasonication, indicating a decrease in the sizes of the WC nanoparticles, as shown in Fig. S4.† The transmittance spectra of the WC and MoO3 films were plotted in Fig. S5,† in which the WC films exhibited weaker absorption than that of the MoO3 film, especially below 400 nm.
Energy matching of the frontier orbital energies of the photo-active layer to the inter-layer is essential in order to establish electronic equilibrium and minimize the charge extraction barrier. The difference of surface potential between the active layer and the film fabricated from the WC nanoparticles was evaluated using scanning Kelvin probe microscopy (SKPM) in ambient atmosphere. The experimental setup was according to the previous report,34 in which the surface potentials of P3HT:PC61BM films with and without the WC nanoparticles were measured respectively. Fig. 3(a) and (b) are the topographic images of P3HT:PC61BM and P3HT:PC61BM/WC, while Fig. 3(c) and (d) were the corresponding surface potential images. The SKPM measurement of the surfaces after spin-coating with WC nanoparticles revealed that the surface potential was 122 ± 37 eV more negative than that of the surface without WC nanoparticles. The results indicated an electric dipole moment with the negative charge pointing toward the P3HT:PC61BM and the positive charge pointing toward the silver electrode, as shown in Fig. S6.† The microscopic electrical field between the P3HT:PC61BM layer and the anode was energetically favourable with respect to the charge extraction. However, the WC displayed a work function of 4.7 eV as determined by UPS (Fig. S7†), which is lower than that of MoO3.

The film quality of the buffer layers played an important role on the device performance. A thin and compacted film was necessary to allow the WC to fully functionalize the surface as an efficient hole extraction layer. The film quality was determined by AFM, as shown in Fig. 4. The P3HT:PC61BM films with and without WC exhibited dramatically different topographies. Without WC, there were obvious interpenetrating networks in the P3HT:PC61BM film, as shown in Fig. 4(a) and (c). While this feature was diminished in the WC functionalised film since the P3HT:PC61BM was partially covered by the WC nanoparticles (Fig. S8(c) and (d)).† When the WC film was fabricated by spin-coating three times, this feature disappeared altogether, implying that a uniform and smooth WC film had been formed, as shown in Fig. 4(b) and (d). If the WC was deposited by spin-coating only once or twice, there would be pinhole regions where silver could make direct contact with P3HT:PC61BM. Here, the multiple spin-coating process was utilized to obtain a continuous WC film. The film thickness was ∼5–15 nm as determined by ellipsometry. In addition, pure isopropanol was spin-coated onto the active layers in order to exclude the solvent effect on the film quality of the P3HT:PCBM films, and the AFM images (Fig. S9†) indicated that isopropanol had little influence on the surface morphology. In addition, the SEM image in Fig. S10(a)† exhibited a uniform WC film deposited on P3HT:PCBM by spin-coating three times. The carbon signal resulted from P3HT, PCBM and the WC nanoparticles, while the tungsten signal was solely from the WC. Fig. S10(c)† suggested that the WC film was uniform and continuous, since if the nanoparticles were only partially covering the active layer, the tungsten element signal would be expected to be randomly distributed as opposed to uniform and continuous.

To assess the effectiveness of the WC nanoparticles as a hole transporting layer, P3HT:PC61BM and PTB7:PC71BM were utilized as photo-active layers, since both of them are well characterized systems. The structure of the inverted bulk heterojunction devices is illustrated in Fig. 5(a), while a photograph of the real made-up device is shown in Fig. 5(b). The energy band structures of the devices are illustrated in Fig. S11.† The high work function metal oxides, which acted as anode buffer layers, were replaced with WC. This inter-layer was deposited by a solution spin-coating process at room temperature. No extra-annealing process was necessary before the anode electrode deposition, enabling easy processability over a large area by roll to roll processing. To be able to characterize the thicknesses of each layer of the device, high resolution scanning electron microscopy (HR-SEM) was used. Fig. 5(c) shows the HRSEM cross-section image of the device, in which the thickness of the WC layer was ∼14.5 nm, which was consistent with the one samples with a WC thickness of 5–15 nm as measured by ellipsometry. The images inserted in Fig. 6(a) and (b) show the chemical structures of P3HT and PTB7. The WC films worked as the anode buffer layer for hole transporting. For the devices based on various active layers, the direction of motion of both electrons and holes is the same.

The WC spin-coating steps were repeated three times. MoO3 was fabricated by vacuum thermal evaporation (e-MoO3). 

Fig. 6(a) displays the current density–voltage (J–V) electric output characteristics of the representative devices based on P3HT:PC61BM with different anode buffer layers of either spin-coated WC or e-MoO3. The short-circuit current density (Jsc), the open-circuit voltage (Voc), the fill factor (FF) and the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of all the devices are summarized in Table 1, and were recorded from 20 separate specimens for each type of cell. The reference device with e-MoO3 exhibited a PCE of 3.73% (Voc = 0.61 V, Jsc = 9.08 mA cm−2, FF = 0.67), which is comparable with those performances previously reported.12,13 The device based on the WC anode buffer layer displayed a PCE of 3.83%, with a Voc of 0.61 V, a Jsc of 9.52 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.66, exhibiting a slight enhancement in PCE over the reference cell. Fig. 6(c) shows typical external quantum efficiency (EQE) data for devices based on WC and e-MoO3, demonstrating that the EQE response of the WC-based device was slightly enhanced in comparison to that of the reference. The stability data of the device performances were also plotted in Fig. S12,† in which the WC-based device retained ∼90% of its initial PCE, while the MoO3-based device only retained ∼82% of its initial PCE, after 650 hours air exposure. The WC-based device demonstrated an improved stability, which might be ascribed to the inert and stable chemical properties of WC. The results implied that WC could perform better than the reference of e-MoO3 as an anode buffer layer in P3HT:PC61BM devices.

PTB7:PC71BM, being a general buffer layer for the inverted organic solar cells, was used as an active layer to evaluate the performance of WC, as shown in Fig. 6(b). All the electrical output characteristics based on PTB7:PC71BM are summarized in Table 1. The WC-based device demonstrated a PCE of 8.04% (Voc = 0.72 V, Jsc = 15.98 mA cm−2, FF = 0.70), displaying superior performance to the device with e-MoO3 as the hole transporting layer (Voc = 0.73 V, Jsc = 15.24 mA cm−2, FF = 0.70, PCE = 7.82%). The enhanced Jsc of the WC-based device was supported by the EQE data illustrated in Fig. 6(d), in which the highest measured EQE of this device was 76% at 660 nm. This result further confirmed that solution-processed WC could be an efficient anode buffer layer to replace thermally evaporated high work function metal oxides. In both Fig. 6(c) and (d), the EQE values were slightly improved, especially in the range of 350–400 nm, which was a result of the different transmittances of the MoO3 and WC films. The incident light partially passed through the active layer as well as the hole extraction layer, then was reflected by the silver electrode into the active layer to generate the charges. The absorbed light in MoO3 and WC did not contribute any photocurrent. The WC film displayed weaker absorption below 400 nm as shown in Fig. S6,† and therefore more light was harvested by the active layer, leading to an enhanced EQE. However, the improved EQE at 500 nm was still unclear.
As discussed previously, the compacted WC film was indispensable in achieving high device performance. The electrical output characteristics of the devices based on the WC films fabricated by multiple spin-coatings are plotted in Fig. S13 and summarized in Table S1.† The devices based on the WC films fabricated by three consecutive depositions exhibited the best PCEs both in the P3HT:PC61BM and the PTB7:PC71BM devices, which was consistent with our previous observation in which a dense and compacted WC layer was formed by three repeated depositions. In addition, it has been very recently reported that the solvent treatment (methanol) on organic materials could enhance the charge extraction.34 Pristine isopropanol was also deposited on the active layers to exclude its effect on the device performances. As shown in Fig. S14 and Table S2,† the devices based on isopropanol treatment (without MoO3) displayed very poor performances, implying that the isopropanol had very little effect on the device performance.
Both devices displayed similar Voc regardless of whether WC or e-MoO3 was used as the anode buffer layer. A generally accepted estimate for the Voc of a polymer solar cell was given by the offset between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level of the donor and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level of the acceptor minus 0.3 V, which was ascribed to the polaron pair binding energy.35,36 The observation of the similar Voc of the devices indicated that the different anode buffer layers had no influence on the HOMO level of P3HT and the LUMO level of PC61BM. In addition, WC performed a similar function to e-MoO3, acting as the hole extraction layer as well as exerting doping effect, similar to graphene oxide.37
In order to investigate the WC doping effect on the P3HT mobility, thin-film field effect transistors were fabricated based on P3HT as the active layers, both with and without WC or e-MoO3 layers. As can be seen in the transfer characteristics curves shown in Fig. 7(a), the field effect mobility was slightly enhanced from 2.9 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 to 5.6 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 after WC was deposited on the P3HT film. As for e-MoO3, a mobility of 9.6 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 was obtained. It was implied that there was some doping effect in both the WC and MoO3 cases. In addition, the turn-on voltage shifted in a more positive direction, indicating that there were more extra free holes at zero bias requiring complete depletion. The results can be interpreted by considering the charge transfer between WC/e-MoO3 and P3HT. The Fermi level of WC should locate below the ionization potential of P3HT. If a substrate Fermi level falls below an ionization energy of a molecule, the number of ionized molecules will increase dramatically.38 The amount of ionized P3HT increased, generating a positive electric layer in the organic layer, which led to a negative shift of the turn-on voltage. To further confirm the charge transfer from the WC buffer layer to the polymer film, we utilized TCSPC to analyse the photoluminescence (PL) lifetime of both pristine P3HT films and P3HT films with the WC nanoparticles or e-MoO3 layer above. The PL lifetime spectra shown in Fig. 7(b) revealed that a slight decrease in PL lifetime was observed after WC (e-MoO3) deposition. The results indicated that there was charge transfer taking place at the interface in the cases of both WC and MoO3, which was consistent with the turn-on voltage shifting in the TFT device.

IV. Conclusions
In conclusion, the solution-processed WC nanoparticles, which can be dispersed in alcohol solvent easily to form stable suspensions, has been demonstrated as a candidate to form an efficient anode buffer layer in an inverted organic solar cell. The WC film could effectively functionalize the active layer as an anode buffer layer without the need for further post-treatment, and displaying superior device performance with respect to the active layers of P3HT:PC61BM and PTB7:PC71BM. It was indicated that WC could act as a general efficient buffer layer material for inverted organic solar cells. The anode layer introduced here is easy to implement and compatible with a solution processed organic solar cell, and therefore applicable for potential cost-effective manufacturing processes. This discovery of an efficient anode buffer layer could find use in fully exploiting the potential of various organic electronic device systems.
