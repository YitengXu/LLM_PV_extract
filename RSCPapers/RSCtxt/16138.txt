    , Accepted 24th February 2015First published on 24th February 2015AbstractThe establishment of an efficient electric power distribution method is the key to realising a sustainable society driven by renewable-energy-based electricity, such as solar photovoltaics, wind turbine, and wave electricity, in view of supply instability. Here, we demonstrate an electric power circulation method that does not emit CO2 and is based on the glycolic acid (GC)/oxalic acid (OX) redox couple. Direct electric power storage in GC ensures considerably high energy density storage and good transportability through OX electroreduction with significantly high selectivity (>98%) using pure anatase-type titania (TiO2) spheres under mild conditions in the potential region of −0.5 to −0.7 V vs. the RHE at 50 °C. The most desirable characteristic of this electroreduction is the suppression of hydrogen evolution even in acidic aqueous media (Faraday efficiency of 70–95%, pH 2.1). We also successfully generated power without CO2 emissions via selective electrooxidation of GC with an alkaline fuel cell.

Broader context
An excessive increase of CO2 in the atmosphere is regarded as the most probable cause of global warming. A substantive transition from fossil-based systems to systems operated by electricity that is generated using renewable energy, i.e., “renewable electricity”, seems to be the optimal answer to this environmental issue. A lack of efficient distribution techniques for unstably supplied and unevenly distributed renewable electricity is one of the fundamental impediments to its practical use. Thus, electric power storage in high-energy chemicals, called “energy carriers”, has received much attention due to their efficient storage and on-demand supply of renewable electricity. Here, we demonstrate direct electric power charge using an alcohol/carboxylic acid redox couple. Highly energetic and transportable glycolic acid, an alcoholic compound, was successfully produced by electroreduction of oxalic acid, a dicarboxylic acid, on ubiquitous TiO2 catalysts with high efficiency and selectivity (70–95% Faraday efficiency and >98% selectivity). Furthermore, we succeeded in electric power generation via the selective electrooxidation of glycolic acid to oxalic acid without CO2 emission—specifically, carbon-neutral power generation. These results are the first experimental proof of concept for a carbon-neutral energy circulation system based on charging/discharging electric power using an alcohol/carboxylic acid redox couple.

Efficient energy storage via the conversion of electric power into high-energy chemicals, so-called energy carriers, is critically important for the practical application of intermittent renewable energies.1–3 Hydrogen is a clean energy carrier that is producible by water electrolysis using renewable electricity4–6 and does not produce any harmful wastes or CO2 in the power generation process.6 The development of efficient hydrogen storage and release systems remains a challenge for long-distance transportation and long-term storage7,8 because hydrogen is gaseous and highly explosive (13 MJ m−3 energy density and 4–74% flammability limits in air9). Recently, methods for the highly efficient storage of hydrogen by compression,10 liquefaction,7 adsorption using porous materials such as zeolites,11 carbon materials12 and metal–organic frameworks,13 and chemical storage using cyclic hydrocarbons,14 formic acid15 and inorganic hydrides16,17 have reached an advanced stage. Gas storage and release operations entail a certain loss of energy efficiency, increasing the energy costs of energy circulation using hydrogen, as described in Scheme S1 (ESI†).
Alcohols have been regarded as an energy carrier because of their considerably high energy density (e.g., energy densities of ethanol and ethylene glycol are 23000 and 22000 MJ m−3, respectively) and appropriate chemical stability. The direct electrooxidation of alcohols in fuel cells has been widely investigated.18,19 The perfect oxidation of alcoholic compounds, however, results in CO2 emissions as long as carbon-containing chemicals are used as a fuel. On the other hand, the partial oxidation of alcohols to carboxylic acids generates ca. 80% of potentially available electric power without CO2 emission,20 as described in eqn (1). R–CH2OH + H2O → R–COOH + 4H+ + 4e−(1) Furthermore, if alcoholic chemicals are directly renewed by the electroreduction of the carboxylic acids using renewable electricity, in accordance with the reverse reaction of eqn (1), we can sustainably circulate renewable energy through the intermediary of an alcohol/carboxylic acid redox couple. Recently, we have reported power generation by the partial electrooxidation of ethylene glycol, which is easily handled, to oxalic acid (HOOC–COOH, OX) without CO2 emission.20 Renewing alcoholic compounds by direct electroreduction of OX is another challenge, which enables highly efficient electric power circulation. To the best of our knowledge, the electroreduction of carboxylic acids to alcoholic compounds has never been achieved. Meanwhile, the chemical reduction of carboxylic acids to alcoholic chemicals is an in-demand chemistry in fine chemical production21–24 and bio-refineries.25–30 Considering that alcohol productions from carboxylic acids have been conducted under severe conditions (e.g., 100–380 °C, 2–6 MPa of hydrogen atmosphere),23–27 the development of efficient carboxylic acid reduction catalysts is expected to open up novel synthetic routes for useful chemical products. Then, we surveyed the catalytic performances of various metals and oxides, including Al, Ti, V, Ni, Cu, Zr, Nb, Mo, Sn, Pt and Pb, and determined that only calcined Ti foil catalyses the electrochemical reduction of OX to 2-electron-reduced glyoxylic acid (HOOC–CHO, GO) and a small amount of 4-electron-reduced glycolic acid (HOOC–CH2OH, GC) (Fig. S1, ESI†). Several compounds are considered as a reduced form of OXvia multistep reductions as shown in Scheme S2 (ESI†). However, only GO and GC were obtained upon electroreduction on the Ti foil. The catalytic activity was enhanced by the calcination of the Ti foil, with observed product yields on Ti and calcined Ti of 0.3 and 2.9%, respectively. This activity presumably indicates that a TiO2 layer that formed on the Ti foil acted as an active site for OX reduction.
The fabrication of nanostructures as electrocatalysts contributes to the enhancement of catalytic performance by maximising the availability of catalytic sites and facilitating the diffusion of electrons and reactants by increasing the catalyst's surface area.31,32 We aimed to further increase the OX reduction activity to increase selectivity for the highly reduced GC by increasing the active surfaces of TiO2 by synthesising nanometre-sized TiO2 as porous TiO2 spheres (PTSs) with a high specific surface area using layered protonated titanate (LPT) calcination.33 In this paper, we demonstrate the highly selective and efficient electroreduction of OX to GC using purely anatase-type PTSs under moderate conditions in the potential region of −0.5 to −0.7 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). GC is chemically stable and has a high energy density (8600 and 13000 MJ m−3 for partial and perfect oxidations, to OX and CO2 respectively), which are similar to the densities of ethanol in the case of partial oxidation to acetic acid (8400 MJ m−3). The most distinguishable merit of using the alcohol/carboxylic acid redox couple as an energy carrier is the facilitation of storage and release operations compared to gaseous carrier systems, leading to an improvement in the energy efficiency, as described in Scheme S1 (ESI†). Furthermore, we succeeded in directly generating power from GC using an alkaline fuel cell without CO2 emission. Briefly, this paper represents the first demonstration of carbon-neutral energy circulation by direct electric power charge–discharge using energy carriers (Scheme 1).

PTSs were synthesised by calcination of LPT at 150, 300, 450, 500, 525, 550 and 600 °C for 1 h under flowing air.33 The LPT and the PTSs were characterised by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and nitrogen adsorption–desorption measurements. XRD patterns of uncalcined and calcined LPTs are shown in Fig. S2(a) and (b) (ESI†). The XRD pattern of the uncalcined LPT is assignable to the H2Ti2O5·H2O phase. However, the peaks in the diffraction pattern of the LPTs calcined at 150 °C were attributable to an anatase-type TiO2 phase in addition to those from the H2Ti2O5·H2O phase, and the diffraction intensities from the anatase phase increased with increasing calcination temperature. Only XRD patterns of anatase-type TiO2 were obtained from LPT calcined at temperatures above 500 °C (Fig. S2(a)–(c), ESI†).
TEM revealed that all of the calcined LPTs exhibited spherical morphologies, irrespective of the calcination temperature, with sizes ranging from 800 to 1100 nm (Fig. 1(a)–(c) and Fig. S3(a)–(d) and (i), ESI†). The calcined LPTs are denoted together with their calcination temperatures as PTS-150, -300, -450, -500, -525, -550 and -600. High-magnification TEM images of the products are shown in Fig. 1(d)–(f) and Fig. S3(e)–(h) (ESI†). We observed that an LPT was constructed from a number of thin nanosheets. As the calcination temperature increased, the nanosheets gradually converted into nanorod-like morphologies with a high aspect ratio of 5–15 nm × 400–500 nm. When the calcination temperature was increased to 600 °C, the rod-like morphologies partially crumbled. High-resolution (HR) TEM observations provided more detailed structural information. An observed interlayer distance of 0.97 nm in the layered structure of the LPTs was assignable to the (002) planes of H2Ti2O5·H2O, and the measured d-spacing of 0.35 nm for the nanorods contained in PTS-500 and -600 fitted the (101) spacing of anatase-type TiO2 (Fig. 1(g)–(i)). The characterisation indicated that the structural features, crystallinity and surface morphology varied with the calcination temperature and that PTSs prepared at calcination temperatures higher than 500 °C were composed primarily of a highly crystalline anatase-type TiO2 phase (>99 wt%) and characterised by a large surface area (82.1–43.2 m2 g−1) (Fig. S2(c) and (d), and S3(j)–(l), ESI†).

Orange and blue bars represent yields and Faraday efficiencies of GC and GO generations, respectively. The OX electroreductions were performed at −0.627 V vs. RHE at 24 °C for 2 h in 0.16 M OX solution containing 0.16 M Na2SO4 (pH 1.2). 
The catalytic activity of PTSs in OX electroreduction was examined by chronoamperometry (CA) in 0.16 M OX with 0.16 M Na2SO4 at −0.627 V vs. RHE at 24 °C. Electrodes were prepared by drying a methanol PTS suspension dropped onto Ti foil, followed by calcination at 150–600 °C. As summarised in Fig. 1(j), the product yield from the starting substrate and Faraday efficiency, that is defined in the ESI,† on the PTS deposited Ti foil electrodes increased with increasing calcination temperature up to 500 °C, i.e., the highest product yield (23.8%) was attained with PTS-500, which was easily correlated with the structural change from H2Ti2O5·H2O to the catalytically active TiO2 phase with increasing temperature. Notably, the OX electroreduction on PTS-500 proceeded with 34.7% GC selectivity and 100% Faraday efficiency. However, the product yield and Faraday efficiency on the electrode treated above 500 °C sharply deteriorated, with the PTS-600-mounted electrode demonstrating a minimal product yield (0.5%), although the PTS structures should have been nearly unchanged according to our XRD analyses. To understand this rapid catalytic deterioration, we examined the surface states of active PTS-500 and inactive PTS-600 by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (Fig. S4(a)–(d), ESI†). The O 1s peaks were recorded at approximately 527–533 eV for both PTSs and could be decomposed into two spectral components assignable to the surface hydroxyl group and the structural oxygen in TiO234 (Fig. S4(c) and (d), ESI†). The peak area ratios (ATiO2/AOH) for the structural oxygen (ATiO2) and hydroxyl oxygen species (ATiO2) on PTS-500 and -600 were calculated to be 0.206 and 0.110, respectively. The disagreement in these values seems to be reasonable given that the different surface areas of the PTSs, i.e., the ATiO2/AOH values normalised by the BET surface area of PTS-500 and -600 (Fig. S3(l), ESI†), were calculated to be 2.51 × 10−3 and 2.54 × 10−3, respectively, which are almost identical. Furthermore, we confirmed no OX affinity difference between the two types of PTSs using classical adsorption measurements (Fig. S4(e), ESI†). These results imply that the difference in catalytic activity between PTS-500 and -600 originates from their interior aspects. Ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) absorption spectroscopic characterisation of PTS-500, -550, -600 and rutile-type TiO2 nanoparticles (rutile NPs, Fig. S5, ESI†) showed that sharp increases in absorption in the wavelength region of λ = 390–410 nm corresponded to the band-gap energy of TiO2 (Fig. S6(a), ESI†). The observed redshifts with increasing calcination temperature are explained by the gradual structural change from the anatase to the rutile phase, although a negligible amount of rutile phase formation was confirmed in inactive PTS-600. These results correlate the catalytic degradation and rutile phase formation, indicating the significance of detailed surface structural analyses for further mechanistic understanding. Anatase- and rutile-type TiO2 show characteristic electron energy-loss spectral (EELS) patterns35 (Fig. S6(b) and (c), ESI†), respectively. We produced scanning TEM (STEM) images and phase distribution maps of the anatase and rutile phases on PTS-500 and -600 via the spectral structure recognition of each phase, as shown in Fig. 2(a)–(d). Interestingly, EELS mapping revealed that PTS-500 is composed of purely anatase-type TiO2, whereas PTS-600 contains a rutile-type TiO2, especially around the surface. We examined the catalytic activity of rutile NPs, which are characterised by a different crystal symmetry, and observed that both product yield and Faraday efficiency on rutile NP were relatively low compared to those on PTS-500 (Fig. 1(j)). In addition, we observed that the catalytic performance of a 1:1 physical mixture of PTS-500 and rutile NP was considerably higher than that of PTS-600 (Fig. 1(j)). Thus, the excellent catalytic activity of PTS-500 can be attributed to the catalyst surface composed of only the anatase phase. The drastic decrease in the catalytic performance on PTS-600 originated from the formation of the rutile-type TiO2 thin layer that was closely attached to the anatase-type TiO2 spheres by calcination above 500 °C as illustrated in Fig. 2(e) and (f).

The grey and black squares represent conduction and valence bands, respectively, assuming that the flat-band potential is equal to the conduction-band edge potential. 
Here, we discuss why PTS-500 serves as a highly efficient and selective electrocatalyst to convert OX into GC. The conduction-band bottom of anatase-type TiO2 lies at a position that is 0.2 V higher than that of rutile-type TiO2,36 resulting in the greater reducibility of anatase-type TiO2 compared to rutile-type TiO2 (Fig. 2(g)). Electrons provided by the electrode are possibly accumulated in the conduction band of TiO2. Therefore, electrons introduced into the conduction band of anatase-type TiO2 have a higher reduction potential than those introduced into the conduction band of rutile-type TiO2. In aqueous media, H2 evolution can be a major reaction due to the high collision probabilities of protons with catalysts, especially under acidic conditions. Nevertheless, GC formation occurs over the PTSs with 100% Faraday efficiency, most likely assignable to the formation of oxygen vacancies at bridging sites and to the conversion of Ti4+ sites to Ti3+ sites during the application of electric current. The Ti3+ sites are stable under acidic conditions37–39 and are favourable for the adsorption of a hydrophilic carboxyl group in a manner similar to the behaviour of the photogenerated hydrophilicity of TiO2,40 leading to the high Faraday efficiency for OX reduction, i.e., suppression of hydrogen evolution. To evaluate the effects of the porous morphology of PTSs on catalytic activity, nonporous, bulky, anatase-type TiO2 (anatase bulk) with a specific surface area of 10.1 m2 g−1 was synthesised and used as a catalyst (Fig. S7, ESI†). The anatase bulk exhibited smaller product yield and lower GC selectivity than PTS-500, indicating that the high PTS surface area favours efficient OX reduction (Fig. 1(j)).
We next conducted detailed studies on OX reduction using PTSs.
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) indicated that the onset potentials of OX reduction on Ti foil, and Ti foils modified with PTS-450, -500 and -600 were −0.28, −0.15, −0.11 and −0.25 V vs. RHE, corresponding to overpotentials of 0.41, 0.28, 0.24 and 0.38 V vs. RHE, respectively (Fig. S8, ESI†). It is notable that the PTS-500-modified electrode exhibited the lowest overpotential and the largest reduction current. Recently, efficient hydrogen evolution by H2O electrolysis at low overpotentials has been realised.41–48 Given that the overpotentials for hydrogen evolution vary from 0.040 to 0.35 V vs. RHE, GC production viaOX electroreduction is competitive with H2O electrolysis. The temperature dependence of the catalytic performance of PTS-500 in 0.03 M OX with 0.2 M Na2SO4 at −0.7 V vs. RHE was investigated (Fig. 3(a)–(c), and Fig. S9(a)–(c), ESI†). GC selectivity was enhanced to 99% when the temperature was increased from 24 to 50 °C, and 92–96% Faraday efficiencies were achieved at each reaction temperature. Considering that the electroreduction performed at 50 °C exhibited the highest efficiency for GC formation (Fig. 3(c)), we examined the dependence of potential on OX reduction at 50 °C (Fig. 3(d)–(f), and Fig. S9(d)–(f), ESI†). In the potential region of −0.4 to −0.6 V vs. RHE, the GC selectivity remained >98%, even after 6 h. Electroreductions performed at −0.5 and −0.6 V resulted in ca. 70 and 80% Faraday efficiencies, respectively, although the efficiency obtained at −0.4 V was 20%. Thus, even by employing an electrode simply fabricated via solvent evaporation, we achieved efficient OX reduction with >98% GC selectivity and 70–95% Faraday efficiency in the potential range of −0.5 to −0.7 V vs. RHE at 50 °C. For the stability evaluation of the catalyst, repeated OX electroreductions using an identical electrode were performed. The GC selectivity and Faraday efficiency in OX reduction remained >98% and 80%, respectively, in three successive reactions using a PTS-500-modified electrode as shown in Fig. S10 (ESI†). Gradual exfoliations of the catalysts from the electrode were observed during the measurements. These results suggest that catalytic activities of PTS-500 are maintained under the conditions applied in this study and the observed deterioration in Faraday efficiency mainly comes from the exfoliation of PTS-500 from the Ti foil. Therefore, we believe that appropriate improvements in the electrode fabrication method will conduce to further enhancement in catalytic performances of PTSs.

All electrochemical experiments, except for the blank measurement, were conducted in 0.03 M OX aqueous solution containing 0.2 M Na2SO4 (pH 2.1). 
We then demonstrated the feasibility of power generation by direct GC electrooxidation using alkaline fuel cells (direct GC-AFC). The potentiodynamic and power density curves obtained with 10 wt% GC in 10 wt% KOH at 70 °C using a previously reported20 alkaline fuel cell fabricated using LaSr3Fe3O10 as an electrolyte are shown in Fig. 4(a). The cell employing a commercial Pt catalyst exhibited an open-circuit potential of 0.65 V and a peak power density of 18 mW cm−2. Notably, 99% selectivity for OX formation and 100% Faraday efficiency were confirmed (Fig. 4(b)), which are requisites for realising CO2-free power generation. We estimated efficiencies in the power charge and discharge processes by assuming 100% efficiency for both O2 evolution and reduction on the Pt counter electrode using the method described in the ESI.† The efficiencies for OX electroreduction at −0.6 V vs. RHE and GC electrooxidation at 0.6 V vs. RHE were determined to be 39 and 38%, respectively. These efficiencies will be enhanced by improvements in electrode structures.

Conclusions
We succeeded in OX electroreduction into GC on PTS catalysts, which is the first demonstration of direct electric power storage via electroreduction of a carboxylic acid. Catalytic performances of PTSs depended strongly on the calcination temperature in the catalyst preparation process. Detailed structural analyses including state-of-the-art EELS mappings attributed the highest activity of PTS-500 to energy states of a purely anatase-type TiO2 and active surfaces formed on porous titanates. Furthermore, we performed power generation via highly selective electrooxidation of GC to OX without CO2 emission using a direct GC-AFC with a Pt anode catalyst. This work presents the first experimental proof-of-concept of renewable electricity circulation using an alcohol/carboxylic acid redox couple with a minimal environmental impact. We believe that this novel idea for energy circulation will contribute to the efficient distribution of renewable electricity and to the realisation of a sustainable society.

Broader context
An excessive increase of CO2 in the atmosphere is regarded as the most probable cause of global warming. A substantive transition from fossil-based systems to systems operated by electricity that is generated using renewable energy, i.e., “renewable electricity”, seems to be the optimal answer to this environmental issue. A lack of efficient distribution techniques for unstably supplied and unevenly distributed renewable electricity is one of the fundamental impediments to its practical use. Thus, electric power storage in high-energy chemicals, called “energy carriers”, has received much attention due to their efficient storage and on-demand supply of renewable electricity. Here, we demonstrate direct electric power charge using an alcohol/carboxylic acid redox couple. Highly energetic and transportable glycolic acid, an alcoholic compound, was successfully produced by electroreduction of oxalic acid, a dicarboxylic acid, on ubiquitous TiO2 catalysts with high efficiency and selectivity (70–95% Faraday efficiency and >98% selectivity). Furthermore, we succeeded in electric power generation via the selective electrooxidation of glycolic acid to oxalic acid without CO2 emission—specifically, carbon-neutral power generation. These results are the first experimental proof of concept for a carbon-neutral energy circulation system based on charging/discharging electric power using an alcohol/carboxylic acid redox couple.

 	Scheme 1  Carbon-neutral energy cycling using the GC/OX redox couple. Grey, red and yellow spheres represent carbon, oxygen and hydrogen atoms, respectively.	 

 	Fig. 1  (a–i) TEM images of layered protonated titanate (LPT) before and after calcination. Low-magnification (top), high-magnification (middle) and high-resolution images (bottom) of LPT (a, d and g) and LPT calcined at 500 (PTS-500, b, e and, h) and 600 °C (PTS-600, c, f and, i). OX electroreduction performances of a variety of TiO2 catalysts. (j) Yields and Faraday efficiencies for products generated in OX electroreductions using calcined Ti foil and PTSs, rutile NP, a physical mixture of PTS-500 and rutile NP, and anatase bulk deposited onto Ti foil. Orange and blue bars represent yields and Faraday efficiencies of GC and GO generations, respectively. The OX electroreductions were performed at −0.627 V vs. RHE at 24 °C for 2 h in 0.16 M OX solution containing 0.16 M Na2SO4 (pH 1.2).	 

 	Fig. 2  EELS maps of anatase and rutile phases on PTSs and energy diagrams of anatase- and rutile-type TiO2 included in PTSs. (a) and (c) STEM images of PTS-500 and -600. (b) and (d) EELS maps of PTS-500 and -600 composed of Ti L3-edge signals in the area marked by red squares in (a) and (c). The EELS signal intensities from the anatase and rutile phases are recognised by green and red colours, respectively. The dark area in PTS-600 shown in (d) indicates the weakened intensity of the beam caused by transmission through the thick centre of PTS-600. Illustrations for distributions of anatase and rutile phases in (e) PTS-500 and (f) PTS-600. (g) Energy diagrams of conduction and valence bands for anatase- and rutile-type TiO2 conduction and valence bands and redox potentials for H2 and GC evolutions. The grey and black squares represent conduction and valence bands, respectively, assuming that the flat-band potential is equal to the conduction-band edge potential.
