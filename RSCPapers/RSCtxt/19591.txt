    , Accepted 8th July 2019First published on 16th July 2019AbstractRecently, interface and compositional engineering have been effective approaches in the field of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). In this work, the surface of the nickel oxide layer and perovskite composition are modified by poly[(9,9-bis(30-((N,N-dimethyl)-N-ethylammonium)-propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)] dibromide (PFN-P2) and deionized (DI) water, respectively, which result in a device with 20.5% efficiency and great stability.
Organic–inorganic perovskite materials, due to their excellent optoelectronic properties and low-cost processing, have attracted many research groups recently. These materials with the ABX3 crystal structure (A: cesium (Cs), methylammonium (MA) or formamidinium (FA), B: Pb or Sn, and X: Cl, Br or I) have been good candidates for the fabrication of highly efficient perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with a certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.2%.1–7 Basically, PSCs have two architecture designs, normal and inverted structures. PSCs with normal structures normally show slightly higher PCE and stability, however, the inverted PSCs have some advantages such as ease of fabrication, lower hysteresis, and low-cost processing.7 Extensive efforts are required to address all of the shortcomings in the inverted design, particularly stability. For instance, surface passivation of the perovskite film is a great strategy to improve the open circuit voltage (Voc) and thus efficiency as well as stability of the PSCs.8–10 In this regard, Luo et al.11 improved the Voc of the inverted PSC significantly up to 1.21 V, by surface passivation of perovskites using guanidinium bromide, resulting in a PSC based on a commonly used hole transporting layer (HTL), i.e., poly(triaryl amine) (PTAA) with over 20% efficiency. Stolterfoht et al.12 fabricated highly efficient inverted PSCs based on PTAA using interface engineering techniques and achieved certified PCEs of 19.83%. Although the PCE of such devices using the PTAA HTL is high, the stability still remains a big challenge for inverted architectures. It is proved that metal oxides have higher carrier mobility and better thermal stability than the organic HTLs.13,14 Nickel oxide (NiO) is one of the promising inorganic HTLs in the inverted PSCs.15 Precise optimizations for NiO HTLs in terms of film quality and thickness are required to achieve high efficiency devices. In fact, decreasing the thickness of NiO may cause pinholes and non-uniformity in the HTL, resulting in shorting issues for the PSC. Consequently, interface engineering could be an effective strategy to address such a problem.16–23 Besides interface modification, compositional engineering of the perovskite film is another effective technique to improve the device stability and efficiency.24–26 In the literature, many people added different additives such as PCBM, adamantanes, etc. to either the perovskite solution or anti-solvent and improved the quality of the perovskite film and its stability.27–30 Among them, DI water is an interesting additive (either in the perovskite solution or by applying during annealing) for improving the crystallinity of the perovskite film.31 Liu et al.32 modified the precursor solution of a single A-cation perovskite using water and found that the grain size, crystallinity and lifetime of the perovskite film are enhanced upon this modification, which resulted in higher efficiency.
Here, we employ two approaches, interface engineering using PFN-P2 and compositional engineering with water additive to simultaneously improve the open circuit voltage (Voc) and short circuit current density (Jsc) of inverted PSC, respectively, and fabricate more stable devices. In this regard, a thin layer of PFN-P2 as an interface layer is applied on the surface of NiO HTL. Upon this modification, we improve the Voc of the inverted PSC, due to lower interface recombination, as proved via electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). In addition, we find that the crystallinity of the perovskite film is improved drastically by using a water additive, as confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and photoluminescence (PL) measurements. Based on these modifications, a PSC with a maximum PCE of 20.5% is achieved. Moreover, our modified device shows excellent operational stability for 300 h under continuous illumination with only 14% loss in PCE.
In this study, we considered a triple-A cation perovskite system (cesium (Cs)/formamidinium (FA)/methylammonium (MA)) as an absorber layer and modified it by water additive. Fig. S1a and b (ESI†) show top-view SEM images of the perovskite films without and with a water additive. It is obvious that the modified film with water has a larger average grain size (∼850 nm) as compared to the reference film (320 nm). The surface of the resulting perovskite films was further studied via atomic force microscopy (AFM). Fig. S2 (ESI†) shows the AFM images of the corresponding perovskite films, which are in good agreement with SEM results in terms of grain size. The surface roughness of the perovskite film is decreased from 42 ± 6 nm to 24 ± 4 nm by adding water, as shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†). The smoother surface of the modified perovskite film can possibly reduce the interface recombination and improve the charge transportation.9 Fig. S1c (ESI†) demonstrates the UV-visible and PL spectra of the represented films. As seen, the modified film has slightly better absorption and stronger PL emission, which are mainly due to the larger grains, lower defects and better crystallinity. Time-resolved PL (TRPL) spectra of these samples are shown in Fig. S1d (ESI†). TRPL curves were fitted by a biexponential equation and the fitting parameters are listed in Table S1 (ESI†). Our results indicate that the film modified by water has longer lifetime (23.1 ns) as compared to the reference sample (14.55 ns), which is consistent with the morphology and crystallinity of the perovskite films. We also studied the crystallinity of the perovskite film by using X-ray diffraction patterns, as shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†). The modified film depicts stronger peaks than the reference sample, which can be corresponded to its better morphology and larger grain size.9
In order to study the role of water on the photovoltaic (PV) parameters of the PSCs, devices with inverted architecture, i.e., indium-doped tin oxide (ITO) glass/NiO/Perovskite/C60/BCP/Ag were fabricated. Fig. 1a shows the schematic of PSCs modified by using water additive. The amount of water inside the precursor solution is optimized as shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†). We find that perovskite solution with 2 vol% of water represents the optimum condition for the fabrication of efficient PSCs. Fig. 1b depicts the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the best performing PSCs without and with water measured under AM1.5G conditions and reverse scanning. The summary of the photovoltaic (PV) parameters is listed in Table S2 (ESI†). The reference cell depicts a Voc of 1083 mV, a Jsc of 22.26 mA cm−2, a FF of 77.1% and a PCE of 18.59%. In contrast, the modified device shows improved PV parameters, i.e., a Voc of 1101 mV, a Jsc of 23.3 mA cm−2, and a FF of 77.8%, resulting in an improved PCE of 19.95%. From the J–V results, addition of water to the precursor solution of the triple-A cation perovskite can drastically enhance all PV parameters and this improvement is originated due to better perovskite crystallinity as proved by film characterizations earlier. We also record the maximum power point (MPP) of the corresponding devices, as shown in Fig. 1c, indicating their stability under illumination for 60 s. To investigate the reproducibility of our devices, we measure the statistics of PV parameters of 10 devices obtained from different batches (see Fig. S6, ESI†). The average values of the PV parameters are in good agreement with the best performing devices. In addition, the Jsc of these PSCs is further validated using an external quantum efficiency (EQE) test (Fig. 1d). The calculated Jsc values obtained from the EQE results are 21.25 and 22.18 mA cm−2 for the reference and modified PSCs, respectively, confirming the obtained Jsc using the J–V results. Higher Jsc in the modified PSC can be attributed to the improved optical properties of the perovskite film modified by water.

In fact, by adding water into the perovskite precursor, a composition of perovskite and H2O hydrate is formed, which has a lower stabilization energy, especially during the annealing process. Water changes the chemical and physical properties of the mixed solvent (DMF:DMSO) in perovskite solution such as solubility, boiling point, and vapor pressure. These variations influence the crystal orientation and grain size of the perovskite crystals.33 In fact, by improving the crystallinity of the perovskite, the absorption and charge transfer are improved and the bulk recombination is reduced due to the reduced grain boundaries, resulting in higher Jsc and Voc, respectively. In order to further improve the efficiency of the PSC, we employ interface engineering in our devices by using PFN-P2 as an interface layer between the perovskite and the NiO HTL. Fig. 2a and b show top-view SEM images of NiO films without and with PFN-P2 layers, respectively. Basically, deposition of the perovskite film directly on the surface of NiO is not easy and we need to treat its surface by oxygen plasma. This treatment can make the surface hydrophilic, which is suitable for deposition. Here, by using PFN-P2 as an interface layer, we address this issue for device fabrication. As seen in the inset images of Fig. 2a and b, the contact angle (CA) of water droplets decreases from 104° to 41°, upon this modification. In addition, the surface of NiO and NiO/PFN-P2 HTLs was studied via AFM. Fig. S7 (ESI†) shows 3D images of the corresponding films. As seen, the roughness of the NiO film is reduced from 13 ± 3 nm to 6 ± 2 nm by adding PFN-P2 layers. This improvement can reduce the interface recombination and improve the charge transfer between the NiO and perovskite films.10 To study the properties of perovskite films deposited on NiO and NiO/PFN-P2, SEM and optical characterization were employed. Fig. S8 (ESI†) shows top-view SEM images of the corresponding perovskite films. From the SEM results, we did not observe any significant change in the perovskite grain size and morphology.

Fig. 2c shows the PL spectra of perovskite films deposited on NiO and NiO/PFN-P2 HTLs. Interestingly, there is a quenching effect for the carriers by adding the PFN-P2 interface layer, which can improve the charge transfer in the device.34 Moreover, we performed TRPL measurements on these samples, which indicated shorter lifetime for the perovskite deposited on the NiO/PFN-P2 layer as compared to the perovskite on the NiO HTL (see Fig. 2d and Table S3, ESI†). This proves that the charge transfer is improved in the PSC with the PFN-P2 interface layer. To evaluate the effect of this interface layer on the PV parameters, we fabricate a PSC device on NiO/PFN-P2 HTL. Fig. 3a shows the cross-sectional SEM image of the corresponding PSC.

(b) J–V curve (the inset curve shows MPPT of the corresponding device) and (c) EQE spectra of the modified PSC based on the NiO/PFN-P2 HTL. (d) Stability test of the reference and modified PSCs without and with PFN-P2 interface layers under continuous illumination. 
The J–V curve of the best performing device with the PFN-P2 interface layer (Fig. 3b) indicates a Voc of 1132 mV, a Jsc of 23.33 mA cm−2, a FF of 77.6%, and a high PCE of 20.5% (see Table S2, ESI†). The MPP of this device shows a stabilized PCE of 20.27% after exposure to illumination for 60 s (inset image in Fig. 3b). The EQE curve of the corresponding device depicts almost similar Jsc as compared to the PSC without PFN-P2 (22.26 mA cm−2) as shown in Fig. 3c. In contrast, this modification improves the Voc of the represented PSC drastically, from 1101 mV to 1132 mV, resulting in 2.7% enhancement in the PCE. The statistics of PV parameters for 10 PSCs with PFN-P2 has also confirmed this improvement (see Fig. S6, ESI†). In addition to these results, we also measured the hysteresis indices (HIs) of our devices, as shown in Fig. S9 (ESI†). As seen, the average value of the HI decreases with compositional engineering by water and interface engineering by PFN-P2 as compared to the reference PSCs. In order to investigate the Voc enhancement in the PSC upon applying the PFN-P2 layer, EIS measurement was performed. Fig. S10 (ESI†) shows the Nyquist plots of the modified PSCs without and with PFN-P2 layers. The inset image shows the equivalent circuit for the fitting purpose. Rs, RRec, and C are the series resistance, recombination resistance, and capacitance of the devices. Our results show that the Rs of the PSC without PFN-P2 (42 Ω) is slightly lower than its counterpart (56 Ω), explaining a slightly higher FF of the device without PFN-P2 (see Fig. S6, ESI†). In contrast, by applying the PFN-P2 layer in the PSC, the RRec is increased from 6243 to 9124 Ω, indicating the lower interface recombination and thus higher Voc in the PSC with PFN-P2.34 To further study the role of PFN-P2 in the device, we performed ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) on NiO, NiO/PFN-P2 and perovskite films, as shown in Fig. S11 (ESI†). We found that by adding the PFN-P2 layer, the valence band of the NiO HTL becomes deeper, which is much closer to the valence band of the perovskite film as compared to pure NiO, resulting in a better charge transfer from the perovskite film to the NiO HTL. This can decrease the interface recombination (also proved via EIS) and increase the Voc of the device.
Stability is one of the main challenges in the field of PSCs. We also evaluate the operational stability of our devices at room temperature under continuous illumination and a nitrogen environment, as shown in Fig. 3d. Our results show that the reference device retains only 64% of its initial PCE after 300 h under illumination. In contrast, upon modification of PSCs using water and PFN-P2, the PCE loss is dropped to 24% and 14%, respectively, indicating the great advantages of synergistic compositional and interface engineering of the inverted PSCs.
Here, we added water inside the perovskite precursor and decreased the grain boundaries. Even though this modification improves the efficiency and stability (under nitrogen flow) of the device, the perovskite film is still vulnerable in a humid environment. Thus, interface engineering is a mandatory step to improve the PCE and stability of the devices for practical applications. As mentioned in the literature,2,11 the PSCs mostly decay from the interfaces and if we properly modify the interfaces, we will be able to address the stability issue even in a humid environment and we can control the ion migration in the PSCs. Consequently, we believe that interface engineering by using PFN-P2 has a more important effect on the PCE and especially on long-term stability.
In summary, we study the synergistic effect of compositional engineering by water additive and interface engineering by PFN-P2 layer on the inverted design of PSCs. Film characterization results reveal that the crystallinity and optical properties of the perovskite film are improved drastically by using water additive, resulting in a PCE of 19.95%. In addition, we treat the surface of the NiO HTL with PFN-P2 and further improve the PCE of the PSC up to 20.5% mainly due to the enhanced Voc and reduced interface recombination. In addition, our modified PSC with both water and PFN-P2 shows great operational stability as compared to the reference device.
