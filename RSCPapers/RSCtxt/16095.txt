    , Accepted 27th January 2017First published on 27th January 2017AbstractThe photovoltaic conversion efficiency of perovskite solar cells based on organic–inorganic CH3NH3PbI3 has risen spectacularly from 3.8% to over 20% in just seven years, yet quite a few important fundamental issues have not been settled, and the role of spontaneous polarization remains poorly understood.

More importantly, we demonstrate strong interactions between polarization and light in technologically relevant CH3NH3PbI3 films with good conversion efficiencies, observing that the spontaneous polarization can also be switched by light illumination in the absence of an electric field. The light is shown to reduce the coercive voltage of CH3NH3PbI3 and shifts its nucleation bias, suggesting that the photo-induced switching is caused by ionic motions in combination with a photovoltaic field. This set of studies offer strong evidence on the interactions among photo-induced charges, polarization, and ions in perovskite CH3NH3PbI3, and these fundamental observations lay the ground for answering the technologically important question regarding the effects of ferroelectricity on its photovoltaic conversion.
Introduction
In the last few years, we have witnessed spectacular advance in the next generation solar cells based on organic–inorganic perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 and related materials, with their photovoltaic conversion efficiency rising to over 20% from 3.8% in just seven years.1–3 The unprecedented gain in device performance, however, comes with only limited progress in the mechanistic understanding of the system, as quite a few important issues remain unsettled, including the origin of hysteresis in J–V curves,4,5 the contribution of ferroelectric polarization in photovoltaic conversion,6–8 and the stability issues of the materials and devices.9–11 For example, J–V hysteresis was originally thought to be induced by ferroelectricity,5,12,13 yet the current understanding is that the ionic motion plays a larger role,14,15 though the effect of polarization cannot be completely discounted. In fact, the ferroelectric switching of CH3NH3PbI3 is yet to be unambiguously established, and the interplay between its polarization and light has rarely been explored.14,16,17
As previous photovoltaic devices do not have to deal with ferroelectricity in general, this ambiguity in perovskite solar cells is partially caused by much confusion surrounding spontaneous polarization and its switching in CH3NH3PbI3. For example, first principles calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) from different groups predicted spontaneous polarization of CH3NH3PbI3 that differs by orders of magnitude,8,18 and macroscopic ferroelectric measurement yielded unrealistic giant apparent polarization that is largely contributed by leakage and ionic currents.15,19 At the microscopic scale, piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) has been adopted to probe possible ferroelectricity in CH3NH3PbI3, though the reported data are often conflicting and inconclusive,7,13,15,17,19–32 due to the complexity in the apparent piezoresponse and its switching that may arise from ionic motions, electrostatic interactions, and other electromechanical mechanisms in addition to piezoelectricity.33–35 All these effects are expected to be present in CH3NH3PbI3,36 and thus it is important to differentiate various microscopic mechanisms that contribute to the apparent piezoresponse in order to confirm its intrinsic piezoelectricity. Because of these ambiguities in both macroscopic polarization and microscopic piezoresponse, reliable experimental measurements and interpretation of CH3NH3PbI3 are very challenging, and the question remains, is CH3NH3PbI3 ferroelectric, and if so, what effect does ferroelectric polarization have on its photovoltaic conversion?
In this work, we use a set of carefully designed PFM experiments and macroscopic polarization measurements to exclude other electromechanical coupling mechanisms as the dominant sources of piezoresponse observed in CH3NH3PbI3, and thus firmly establish its piezoelectric origin and ferroelectricity. Central to our work is a custom-developed second harmonic PFM technique that probes possible nonlinear effects in the apparent piezoresponse,35 which is absent in standard PFM experiments used in previous studies, enabling us to assess contributions from various electromechanical mechanisms. With piezoelectricity and ferroelectricity firmly established in CH3NH3PbI3 as such, we then demonstrate strong interactions between polarization and light in technologically relevant CH3NH3PbI3 films that have good photovoltaic conversion efficiencies, observing that the spontaneous polarization can be switched by light illumination in the absence of an electric field, and the photo-induced surface charges and potentials are shifted by the spontaneous polarization. The light is shown to reduce the coercive voltage of CH3NH3PbI3 and shifts its nucleation bias, suggesting that the photo-induced switching is caused by ionic motions in combination with a photovoltaic field. While this study does not directly address the effects of ferroelectricity on photovoltaic conversion, which requires a different set of experiments at the device level correlating performance metrics to polarization, these fundamental observations lay the ground for eventually answering this technologically important question – they offer strong evidence on the interactions among photo-induced charges, polarization, and possibly ions in perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 that may affect its conversion efficiency, stability and hysteresis.
Results
To investigate ferroelectricity and possible interactions between polarization and light, a high quality CH3NH3PbI3 film is synthesized by a one-step method,37 and the key data on microstructure characterization and macroscopic photovoltaic performance are summarized in ESI Fig. S1 and Table S1.† The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern confirms the excellent crystallinity of perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 films with a preferred (110)-orientation, and a scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image reveals its dense granular structure. Two different types of solar cells are made of these films, the n-i-p type deposited on an electron-collecting FTO/TiO2 substrate, and the p-i-n type deposited on a hole-collecting FTO/PEDOTS:PSS substrate, both of which show good conversion efficiencies of 14.6% (14.5%) and 10.4% (10.3%) under a reverse (forward) scan. They thus give us ideal systems that are technologically relevant to photovoltaic conversion to study ferroelectric polarization and its interactions with light. The same batch of CH3NH3PbI3 films are used in our subsequent investigations of piezoelectric and ferroelectric properties, and the ferroelectric properties of films with low optimal photovoltaic conversion efficiencies are currently under investigation to gain further insight into the device design.
Piezoelectricity and ferroelectric domains
To investigate possible ferroelectricity in CH3NH3PbI3, we first examine its microscopic piezoresponse using a carefully designed PFM experiment, a powerful technique that excites the local electromechanical vibration of the sample through an AC voltage applied via a conducting scanning probe at the sample–probe contact resonance ω0, as schematically shown in Fig. S2;† more information regarding PFM can be found in a number of recent reviews.38–41 While PFM was originally developed for piezoelectric and ferroelectric materials, caution must be exercised in data interpretation and analysis, since PFM excites and measures not only the piezoelectric strain but also other possible electromechanical responses, which can arise from electrostatic interactions, capacitive effects, electrochemical dipoles, and ionic motions.33–35 This is particularly important for CH3NH3PbI3, since the ionic motion is known to be an issue here, and it can be caused by either an electric field15 or light illumination.14 These effects are often nonlinear with the applied electric field, leading to the prominent second harmonic response.42 The linear piezoelectricity, on the other hand, should exhibit itself predominantly the first harmonic response, and thus it is critical to compare the first and second harmonic PFM responses in order to differentiate these various microscopic mechanisms that contribute to the apparent piezoresponse. In a standard PFM experiment, however, only the first harmonic response is measured that probes only a linear effect, revealing nothing about the possible nonlinear behavior. Central to our work is a custom-developed second harmonic PFM technique that probes the possible nonlinear effects in the apparent piezoresponse,35 which is absent in previous studies, enabling us to assess contributions from various electromechanical mechanisms.43 This important yet subtle point is explained in the ESI† in detail.
To understand the origin of electromechanical coupling in CH3NH3PbI3, we probe the first (by exciting and measuring near ω0) and second (by exciting near ω0/2 and measuring near ω0) harmonic responses under an AC excitation of 1 V, as schematically shown in Fig. S3,† and the resulting responses at three representative points for CH3NH3PbI3 on the FTO/PEDOTS:PSS substrate are compared in Fig. 1(a–c). Here, the first harmonic response arises from linear effects while the second harmonic response is associated with quadratic phenomena. The first point shows predominantly a linear response and a negligible quadratic one, while the second point has a much smaller magnitude of the linear response, which is comparable to its quadratic response. The third point, on the other hand, has a larger linear response, yet a non-negligible quadratic one. After measuring the first and second harmonic responses at multiple locations, we found that 62.5% of the data fall into the case of Fig. 1a, and another 30% fall into the case of Fig. 1c, while only 7.5% of the data are like the case of Fig. 1b. These results suggest that the electromechanical response in CH3NH3PbI3 is predominantly linear, though they could sometimes be smeared by nonlinear contributions when the linear effect is relatively small, for example due to the misaligned polar orientation. Interestingly, in all three cases, the magnitude of the second harmonic responses is comparable, indicating the existence of nonlinear electromechanical contributions in the films that may arise from ionic motions and electrostatic interactions. This could explain the scattering of PFM data reported in the literature.19,23,31,32 Furthermore, even when the nonlinear effect is not negligible comparable to the linear one, as exhibited by the comparable first and second harmonic responses similar to Fig. 1(c), the first harmonic PFM amplitude is still linear with respect to the AC voltage applied, and this is clearly shown in Fig. S4.†

To verify that the linear electromechanical response of CH3NH3PbI3 indeed arises from its spontaneous polarization, and to exclude the ionic motion as the dominant source of electromechanical coupling, the images of topography, PFM amplitude, and the phase of CH3NH3PbI3 on the FTO/PEDOTS:PSS substrate are shown in Fig. 1(d–f), respectively, and a clear domain pattern is observed in PFM amplitude and phase mappings. These data are obtained using the dual amplitude resonance tracking technique (DART)44 and corrected by the damped driven harmonic oscillator model,45,46 and the original DART PFM mappings are given in Fig. S5,† showing good resonance tracking during scanning. The non-contact tapping mode topography image obtained separately is given in Fig. S6,† and the PFM trace and retrace images of a different region are given in Fig. S7,† showing consistent mappings that indicate no cross-talk with topography. The domains can be seen more clearly in the zoomed-in images of Fig. 1(g–i), where a wall separating two domains in a single grain can be identified, uncorrelated with topography mapping, and thus the contrast cannot arise from topography or different grain orientations. Across a classical 180° ferroelectric domain wall,47 it is expected that the phase of the piezoresponse is reversed, giving 180° phase contrast, while the amplitude drops at the domain wall and then bounces back, and this is exactly what we observe, as shown clearly by the line scan in Fig. 1(j–l). As such, the electromechanical response observed here cannot arise from ionic motions, for which the phase is not supposed to be reversed, and it cannot arise from other nonlinear effects when the first harmonic response dominates. This point of view is further supported by our PFM data measured at a higher temperature of 50 °C, which exhibits a smaller PFM amplitude compared to the room temperature data, as shown in Fig. S8.† If the response arises from the ionic motion, then a much higher amplitude would be expected at a higher temperature due to increased ionic mobility.48,49 Similar PFM mappings are also observed for CH3NH3PbI3 on the FTO/TiO2 substrate, as shown in Fig. S9,† and the qualitative piezoelectric behavior does not depend on the nature of substrates. This set of data, in combination, establish the linear piezoelectricity of CH3NH3PbI3, and the 180° PFM phase contrast presumably arises from the spontaneous polarization of CH3NH3PbI3 that is aligned antiparallel to each other.
Polarization-modulated surface potential and photo-induced potential shifting
What is the implication of spontaneous polarization in CH3NH3PbI3? An electric field would be induced inside from depolarization, and the compensated charges will be attracted to the surface, affecting the distribution of its surface potential. Since the polarization can be aligned upward, parallel, or downward with respect to the surface, the surface potential can be negative, near zero, or positive correspondingly. This is indeed what we observe in the surface potential mappings in Fig. 2(a–c), measured at different locations across one sample of the CH3NH3PbI3 film on the FTO/PEDOTS:PSS substrate using Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM). Three representative mappings of negative, near zero, and positive surface potentials are shown, and similar phenomena have been observed in different samples as well as on different substrates (Fig. S10†). Since what KPFM really measures is the contact potential difference between the probe and sample surface, it is important to note that the same tip was used for these measurements on the same sample, under a constant N2 flow, and thus the differences should not arise from artifacts such as contamination. The surface potential reflects the work function of the material, and is not expected to change in general, unless the band is bent upward or downward by polarization, depending on its direction.50 The potential difference of approximately 100 mV observed, shown in Fig. 2d, can be explained on such basis. Note that on the same location, the surface potential is stable with respect to time, varying by only a few mV, as shown in Fig. S11 and S12† for CH3NH3PbI3 films on FTO/PEDOTS:PSS and FTO/TiO2 substrates, also supporting that the difference we see is intrinsic.

How would such polarization and surface charges interact with light and photo-induced electrons? Depending on the directions of the polarization and the flow of electrons, it could either promote or impede the charge transport. Two contrasting examples of the effect of substrates are shown in Fig. 3(a–f). For CH3NH3PbI3 deposited on hole-collecting FTO/PEDOTS:PSS, holes will migrate downward to PEDOTS:PSS under light illumination, while electrons will migrate upward to the surface of CH3NH3PbI3, shifting its surface potential toward the negative side.51,52 This is confirmed by a comparison of surface potential mappings between Fig. 3(b and e) before and after the light illumination using a 488 nm-wavelength laser, as well as the corresponding histograms between Fig. 3(c and f) showing the shift of the peak surface potential estimated to be about −40 mV. The 488 nm-wavelength laser was chosen because the UV-Vis adsorption spectra of the CH3NH3PbI3 films exhibit a broad absorption spectrum ranging from 400 nm to 800 nm, as shown in Fig. S13,† from which the bandgap of CH3NH3PbI3 is calculated to be ∼1.54 eV in agreement with the literature,53,54 and thus the film can be excited by a laser at λ = 488 nm (hν = 2.54 eV). Furthermore, it is noted that the light is able to penetrate the CH3NH3PbI3 film thickness according to the UV-Vis absorbance spectra. When CH3NH3PbI3 deposited on the FTO/TiO2 substrate, an electron collector, is probed, light illumination shifts the surface potential by 34 mV in the opposite direction, as shown in Fig. 3(g–l). Under this configuration, electrons move downward to TiO2 while holes migrate upward to the surface until equilibrium is established.

To further verify that the observed surface potential shift is indeed due to the photo-induced charges, we measure the variation of the surface potential distribution of the CH3NH3PbI3 film on the FTO/PEDOTS:PSS substrate during multiple cycles between light on and off, and the result is shown in Fig. S14.† As can be clearly seen, when the light is turned on, the surface potential shifts toward a more positive value, and falls back when the light is turned off, and the trend continues if the cycle is repeated. A similar observation of the photo-induced surface potential shift is confirmed with different samples. We also observed that under continuous light illumination for 15 minutes between two KPFM scans, the surface potential is further reduced by 42 mV for the CH3NH3PbI3 film on the FTO/PEDOTS:PSS substrate and increased by 70 mV for it on the FTO/TiO2 substrate, as shown in Fig. S15 and S16,† respectively. In addition, it is observed that the current increases substantially under light illumination as well, as seen in Fig. S17,† which exhibits a quite inhomogeneous distribution. In all the experiments, topography mappings are used to make sure that we compare the surface potential distribution and current mapping of the same area before and after light illumination.
Microscopic and macroscopic ferroelectric switching
It appears that CH3NH3PbI3 has spontaneous polarization that interacts with photo-induced charges, and it is interesting to see whether the polarization can be reversed, so that the photovoltaic conversion can be potentially modulated via ferroelectric switching. This is investigated both locally and globally by microscopic PFM and macroscopic polarization hysteresis measurements. In the PFM measurement, a sequence of DC voltage is applied in an overall triangular waveform to switch the polarization, as shown in Fig. S18(a),† and between each step DC voltage is reduced to zero, during which the piezoresponse is measured via AC excitation. This is necessary to minimize the interference from the electrostatic interaction between the charged probe and sample,55 otherwise charges or apparent polarization will be induced by a large DC field, resulting in loop dependence on both the DC voltage amplitude and rate. One example of the resulting PFM phase-voltage hysteresis loops and amplitude-voltage butterfly loops measured in CH3NH3PbI3 films deposited on the FTO/PEDOTS:PSS substrate are presented in Fig. 4(a and b), and such loops are generally interpreted as signatures for ferroelectric switching. However, it has recently been realized that electrochemical dipoles due to ionic motions can lead to apparent hysteresis and butterfly loops under PFM measurement as well,34,35 though the strain due to such electrochemical dipoles is predominantly quadratic to the applied voltage, which exhibits itself with a larger second harmonic response than the first harmonic one. This is not what we observed as discussed earlier. Another method to distinguish these two different microscopic mechanisms is to examine whether such loops would expand with the increased maximum DC voltage, an indication of a longer range ionic redistribution and thus a larger electrochemical dipole.34,35 This is not what we see here either – the coercive voltages virtually overlap among three loops and the amplitude does not change much under different maximum DC voltages. Furthermore, additional data in Fig. S18(b and c)† show that the loops are insensitive to the rate of the DC voltage applied, while the electrochemical dipoles induced by the ionic motion are rate dependent.34,35 The phase hysteresis and amplitude butterfly loops we see in Fig. 4(a and b) thus cannot arise from ionic motions. Combined with the predominant first harmonic piezoresponse that indicates the linear piezoelectric nature of electromechanical coupling, as well as the reduction of the PFM amplitude with the increased temperature, we can conclude with confidence that the switching observed in CH3NH3PbI3 is indeed ferroelectric in nature. Similar switching behavior has also been observed in the CH3NH3PbI3 film on the FTO/TiO2 substrate (Fig. S19†).
 Fig. 4  Ferroelectric switching of CH3NH3PbI3 films deposited on the FTO/PEDOTS:PSS substrate; (a,b) PFM amplitude–voltage butterfly and phase–voltage hysteresis loops under different maximum DC voltages; (c,d) macroscopic hysteresis loops measured at different cycles switched between light illumination (solid line) and dark (broken line) in (c), and between dark (broken line) and light illumination (solid line) in (d), showing reduced polarization with an increased number of cycles, and then stabilized. 
Ferroelectric switching is also confirmed by macroscopic measurement using a Radiant Precision LC system with a virtual ground mode, as shown in Fig. 4(c and d). The polarization loops are measured under light on and off in sequence, with the first measurement being started by light illumination for Fig. 4(c) and in the dark for Fig. 4(d). The wavelength of the illumination source was chosen to be 450 nm, close to the 488 nm laser source used in PFM experiments, with the illumination intensity well controlled. As seen in Fig. 4(c), the first cycle under light illumination has a high apparent remnant polarization of 19.42 μC cm−2, and with the increased number of cycles, the remnant polarization gradually reduces, and then stabilizes at the 5th cycles around 6 μC cm−2. If we start in the dark, and then turn the light on, the initial remnant polarization of 2.44 μC cm−2 jumps to 4.86 μC cm−2, and gradually reduces back to 2.52 μC cm−2 after repeated testing with light on and off, as seen in Fig. 4(d). Regardless of the initial state under the illumination or in the dark for the first measurement, the apparent polarization usually increases when the light is turned on, and decreases when the light is turned off, until it is stabilized after a few cycles. This set of data indicate that apparent polarization can be resulted from light illumination that arises from both photo-induced electronic and ionic currents, and then gradually dies down with repeated cycles due to saturation.
In order to evaluate the effect of possible leakage current on the polarization loop measurement, the dielectric parameters of the sample were measured with an Agilent LCR instrument. The equivalent electric circuit of the sample is viewed as a capacitor in parallel with a resistor, and the value of the resistor was calculated from the formula tan δ = 1/ωCPRP, where tanδ is the loss tangent, ω is the angular frequency, CP is the parallel capacitance, and RP is the equivalent AC parallel resistance. The frequency was chosen to be 1 kHz, the same as that used in the polarization loop measurement. The resistance under an oscillation voltage of 0.2 V was calculated to be 10 MΩ. With this value of resistance, the contribution of leakage current in the dark to the apparent polarization was estimated to be less than 0.1 μC cm−2, nearly two orders of magnitude smaller than the measured value of polarization. Thus the stabilized value of polarization measured in the dark should represent the intrinsic polarization, as photo-induced electronic and ionic currents are minimized. This measured value is consistent with the theoretical prediction of 5.0 μC cm−2 for CH3NH3PbI3 under the M1 configuration,18 especially considering that the measured polarization is averaged over M1 and M2 configurations, with M2 having near zero polarization. It is also comparable to the theoretical prediction of 8.0 μC cm−2 by Fan et al.,25 but much smaller than 38.0 μC cm−2 predicted earlier.8
Photo-induced ferroelectric switching
The most fascinating observation we have is photo-induced ferroelectric switching, as shown in Fig. 5. The topography, PFM amplitude, phase, and histogram distribution of the amplitude for the CH3NH3PbI3 film on FTO/PEDOTS:PSS measured in the dark are shown in Fig. 5(a–d), revealing a clear ferroelectric domain pattern, wherein there are about 80% light brown domains and 20% black domains. When the light is turned on, and the PFM scanning is repeated in the same area, the phase mapping evolves, while the comparison of topography indicates that the probed region remains to be the same as in the dark. Black domains in Fig. 5(c) remain to be the same after light illumination, but about half of the light brown domains switch to black ones, as indicated in Fig. 5(g), increasing its percentage to about 60%. Associated with this switching, the piezoresponse is also reduced, as indicated by the comparison of the amplitude histogram distributions in the dark and under illumination shown in Fig. 5(d and h). This suggests that light prefers one set of polarization over the other, presumably biased by the internal electric field due to the photovoltaic effect, though not all the domains are switched completely. Similar phenomena are found in the CH3NH3PbI3 films on the FTO/TiO2 substrate as well wherein 43.5% of domains are found switched (Fig. S20†). The switching does not always occurs though, as it is also observed that light does not change the domain pattern at all, as shown in one of the comparisons in Fig. S21,† for which the piezoresponse does not change either.

(i–j) The effect of light illumination on the ferroelectric switching characteristics of the CH3NH3PbI3 film on the FTO/TiO2 substrate; (i) the reduction of coercivity as measured by the difference between the positive and negative coercive voltages, and (j) shifting of the nucleation bias toward a positive voltage, both induced by light illumination (the blue column was measured in the dark while the red column was measured under laser illumination). 
Photo-switching of ferroelectric polarization in CH3NH3PbI3 suggests a strong interaction between light and polarization, and in order to understand this phenomenon, it is insightful to compare the PFM hysteresis loops measured in the dark and under light illumination as well, shown in Fig. S22.† These loops are centralized with respect to the DC voltage for better visualizing the effect of light on the coercivity, and it is evident that the coercive voltage is reduced under light illumination. This is clearly illustrated in Fig. 5i, wherein the differences between the positive and negative coercive voltages (ΔV = V+ − V−) measured on different points are plotted, in the dark (plotted as blue bars) or under illumination (plotted as red bars), suggesting easier switching under light. Furthermore, it is also observed that the nucleation bias, or the asymmetry of hysteresis loops measured by using (V+ + V−)/(V+ − V−) × 100%, is increased substantially under light illumination (plotted as red bars) compared to in the dark (plotted as blue bars), as shown in Fig. 5j, and the loops shift toward the positive bias, suggesting the existence of a nucleation bias induced by light. These data indicate that light illumination not only reduces the coercive voltage that is necessary for the ferroelectric switching, but also shifts the nucleation bias toward a more positive side.
Discussion
Quite a few ferroelectric materials are reported to be photovoltaic,56,57 and they have been explored for solar cell applications,58 as summarized in two recent reviews.59,60 Earlier studies on classical ferroelectrics have also revealed some interesting effects of light on polarization, such as the shift of the internal bias field under ultraviolet (UV) illumination.61–63 In lithium niobate crystals, 30% reduction in the coercive field was found to be induced by light illumination, which was attributed to the space charge fields produced by the photoionization of defects,62 and in a lead zirconate titanate (PZT) film, the nucleation bias shift by UV illumination was attributed to the redistribution of the electric field within the depletion depth under the illuminated surface and the domain wall pinning by trapped charges.61,63 On the other hand, it was also found that the combination of various electric fields and light illumination could suppress ferroelectric hysteresis.64 More recently, the ferroelectric domain wall motion induced by polarized light was reported in barium titanate, due to the internal stress at the domain walls.65 Nevertheless, CH3NH3PbI3 is the first system that exhibits an excellent photovoltaic effect and decent ferroelectricity to date, in which we observed strong interactions between light and its polarization.
What are the possible mechanisms of photo-switching of ferroelectric polarization? The combined experimental data suggest that light illumination reduces the energy barrier for switching, and thus reduces the coercivity, and induces the internal bias that favors one polarization direction over the other, and thus shifts its coercive voltage. Associated with these phenomena is the reduction of the piezoresponse by light illumination. Shifting of the nucleation bias can be understood from the internal electric field induced by the photovoltaic effect. With a spontaneous polarization on the order of μC cm−2 and an open circuit voltage on the order of 1 V, these internal fields are in a delicate balance that can easily shift the energy landscape of polarization. In this regard, we notice a similar observation of photo-switching and reduction of the piezoresponse in PZT, due to the photovoltaic effect of the MoS2 monolayer on top of it,66 but the ferroelectric switching and photovoltaic effect were separated in two different materials there, unlike what we observed with both effects present in CH3NH3PbI3. The reduction of the coercive voltage, as well as the decrease in the piezoresponse, we believe, could be caused by light-induced ion migrations.14,16 In particular, photo-induced halide migration away from the illuminated area has been reported,14 which could lead to the reduction in ferroelectric polarization since first principles calculations revealed that PbI3 anions are a significant contributor to the polarization.18,22 This decreased polarization alone can cause reduction in both the coercive voltage and piezoresponse, and additional reduction in coercivity can arise from increased energy from the light to overcome switching barriers.
What is the ferroelectric implication for the photovoltaic performance of the perovskite solar cells? First of all, the evolution of ferroelectric polarization during cycling is clearly undesirable, and this could affect the efficiency stability of the device. The ferroelectric domain structure needs to be stabilized against both electric field and light illumination. Furthermore, the depolarization field can either promote or impede transport of photo-induced charges, and thus enhance or reduce the photovoltaic performance. This suggests that appropriate poling treatment could be effective at improving the photovoltaic properties, though it could result in ionic motions as well,30,67,68 and the process needs to be carefully engineered. The interactions between ionic motion and polarization will be highly complicated, and require in-depth local investigation correlating these two phenomena, as well as a correlation between local probing and device performance. The recently developed scanning thermo-ionic microscopy69 may provide a powerful tool for such studies, wherein the Vegard strain from the ionic motion can be separated from the electromechanical piezoresponse, and we expect CH3NH3PbI3 offers an ideal platform to investigate complex interactions among polarizations, ions, and photo-induced charges. All these effects are currently under investigation, particularly the influence of polarization and its switching on device performance.
Conclusions
Using a combination of microscopic and macroscopic measurements, we established the linear piezoelectricity of CH3NH3PbI3 that arises from its switchable spontaneous polarization, making it ferroelectric. More importantly, we demonstrate strong interactions between polarization and light in technologically relevant CH3NH3PbI3 films with good conversion efficiencies, observing that the spontaneous polarization can also be switched by light illumination in the absence of an electric field. The light is shown to reduce the coercive voltage of CH3NH3PbI3 and shifts its nucleation bias, suggesting that the photo-induced switching is caused by ionic motions in combination with a photovoltaic field. This set of studies offer strong evidence on the interactions among photo-induced charges, polarization, and ions in perovskite CH3NH3PbI3, and these fundamental observations lay the ground for answering the technologically important question regarding the effects of ferroelectricity on its photovoltaic conversion.
Experimental methods
Sample fabrication
The perovskite precursor solution was prepared by dissolving PbI2 (99.99%, Sigma Aldrich) and CH3NH3I (Xi'an Polymer Light Technology Corp.) with the molar ratio of 1:1 in the mixture of γ-butyrolactone (99%) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, 99.7%) with the volume ratio of 7:3 at a concentration of 462 mg mL−1 under magnetic stirring of 200 rpm at 70 °C. Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass with a sheet resistance of 14 Ω sq−1 was purchased from Pilkington Glass (England) and thoroughly cleaned by ultrasonication and plasma. Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(p-styrene sulfonate) (PEDOTS:PSS, CLEVIOSTM PVP Al 4083) of about 100 nm thickness was spin-coated onto FTO substrates at 4000 rpm for 30 s, followed by annealing at 150 °C for 10 min in ambient air. The compact TiO2 layer of about 50 nm thickness was dip-coated onto FTO substrates using the organic precursor solution,70,71 sintered at 500 °C in ambient air for 30 min, treated with a 40 mM aqueous solution of TiCl4 at 70 °C for another 30 min after cooling down to room temperature, and then dried at 500 °C in ambient air for 30 min after rinsing with deionized water. The CH3NH3PbI3 precursor solution was spin-coated onto FTO/PEDOTS:PSS or FTO/TiO2 substrates in a glovebox under a N2 flow at 1500 rpm for 15 s and then 5000 rpm for another 45 s, followed by acetone wash and annealing at 100 °C under a N2 flow for 30 min. This completed the sample preparation for subsequent atomic force microscopy (AFM) studies and bulk ferroelectric measurements.
To make the p-i-n type of the solar cell on FTO/PEDOTS:PSS substrates, [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM, American Dye Source Inc., 15 mg L−1 in chloroform) and a fullerene surfactant (bis-C60, 2 mg mL−1 in isopropyl alcohol) were spin-coated onto the perovskite films at 1000 rpm for 60 s in a glovebox under a N2 flow, and then a layer of about 100 nm thick Ag (99.99%purity) was thermally evaporated onto the top bis-C60 layer in a vacuum (<2 × 10−6 Torr), defining a device area of 0.09 cm2. For the n-i-p device configuration on FTO/TiO2 substrates, 72.3 mg (2,2′,7,7-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9-spirobifluorene) (spiro-MeOTAD), 28.8 μl 4-tertbutylpyridine and 17.5 μL of a stock solution of 520 mg mL−1 lithium bis(trifluoro-methylsulphonyl) imide in acetonitrile were dissolved in 1 mL chlorobenzene, and spin-coated on top of CH3NH3PbI3 at 4000 rpm for 30 s, also in a glovebox under a N2 flow. Then, a layer of about 100 nm thick Ag was thermally evaporated onto the spiro-MeOTAD layer under vacuum (<2 × 10−6 Torr), defining a device area of 0.09 cm2.
Microstructure characterization and device performance
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite film deposited on various substrates were obtained using a D8 Advance diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (40 kV and 40 mA) at the scanning rate of 4° min−1 for a wide angle test increment over the Bragg angle range of 10–80°. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis was performed with a Hitachi-S4800 electron microscope. The photocurrent–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the solar cells were recorded using a Keithley 2400 source meter unit with simulated sunlight (AM1.5, 100 mW cm2). The illumination intensity of the light source was accurately calibrated using an NREL-calibrated standard Si solar cell with a KG-5 filter.
Scanning probe microscopy
Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM), conductive atomic force microscopy (c-AFM), piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) mappings and switching spectroscopy PFM were carried out with an Asylum Research Cypher atomic force microscope using a BudgetSensors Multi75E-G conductive probe with a spring constant of 3 N m−1. All measurements were performed under a constant N2 flow, in the dark or under light illumination. To illuminate the sample, a commercial blue LED with 488 nm wavelength was used and light was illuminated onto the top side of the sample. The first and second harmonic PFM measurements, which were custom-developed, were carried out on an Asylum Research MFP-3D system in a dark environment.
For KPFM measurements, the probe scans the surface topography using tapping mode first and then a 1 V AC voltage was applied on the probe near its resonance frequency (∼75 kHz) to measure the sample surface potential distribution through a DC voltage feedback loop. All KPFM mappings were performed at room temperature with a lift height of 0.5 nm and a 3 V DC voltage was applied to the probe and each mapping takes about 10 min. In addition, the sample was exposed to light illumination for at least 1 min before doing the KPFM mapping such that there is enough time for the photo-induced charge transport.
For PFM mapping, a 1 V AC voltage was applied on the probe near the sample–probe resonance frequency ω0 to enhance the sensitivity, and the resonance frequency was tracked using the dual-amplitude resonance tracking (DART) technique.44 PFM mappings were measured at both room temperature and elevated temperature (50 °C), through heating up the sample chamber environment controlled by an environment controller. PFM mapping yields the first harmonic PFM response, and in order to obtain the second harmonic response, the excitation voltage is applied at ω0/2 yet measured at ω0 through a lock-in amplifier. The PFM hysteresis loops were measured with two cycles of triangular square DC voltage applied to the probe, with the stepwise DC voltage alternating between on and off states. On top of the DC voltage, there is a small AC voltage imposed to excite the piezoresponse, from which the DC voltage-induced polarization switching can be detected from the phase reversal. All reported PFM amplitude butterfly and phase hysteresis data here were collected in the second cycle.
For current mapping with c-AFM at room temperature, a constant DC voltage of 2 V was applied to the sample surface and the probe was grounded. The c-AFM module includes a transimpedance of an amplifier with a gain value of 5 × 109 volts per amp. Simultaneous images of the sample topography and current distribution were obtained during the scan. During the scanning process, a feedback loop was used to maintain a constant force between the probe and the sample surface.
Macroscopic ferroelectric measurement
The polarization-electric field (PE) hysteresis loops were measured on the CH3NH3PbI3 films deposited on PEDOTS:PSS/FTO substrates using the Lake Shore TTPX Probe Station combined with the Radiant Precision LC Ferroelectric Tester. To apply the electric field to the perovskite films, a top electrode of an about 100 nm thick Al layer was thermally evaporated onto CH3NH3PbI3 films. The measurement was carried out at 1 kHz at room temperature under vacuum with a controlled pressure of around 2.7 × 10−3 Pa. To better compare the macroscopic hysteresis behavior, the PE loops were measured both in the dark and under light illumination using a laser source (LP450-SF15, THORLABS) with a wavelength of 450 nm and a power of 0.5 mW. For Fig. 4(c), the sample was initially exposed to light illumination and the PE loop was measured and recorded, followed by subsequent cyclic measurements of the PE loops in the dark and under light illumination. The same cyclic measurements of the PE loops in the dark and under light illumination were carried out, with the exception that the sample was initially kept in the dark for the first PE loop measurement, which is shown in Fig. 4(d).
