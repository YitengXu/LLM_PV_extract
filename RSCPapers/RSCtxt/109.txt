1. Introduction
Semiconductor metal oxides have been widely used as electrode materials for energy conversion and storage devices, due to their natural abundance, ease of synthesis, superior chemical stability, and relatively low cost.1–6 For example, metal oxides such as titanium dioxide (TiO2), zinc oxide (ZnO), tungsten trioxide (WO3) and hematite (α-Fe2O3) have been extensively studied for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting. Furthermore, metal oxides such as RuO2, MnO2, VOx, CoOx and NiOx nanoparticles have been investigated for supercapacitors, due to their superior pseudocapacitances. While each metal oxide has its own limitations for specific applications, relatively poor electrical conductivity of metal oxide has been an intrinsic limitation for them to serve as electrode materials. For instance, it adversely affects the efficiency of charge separation and collection for PEC cells, as well as the capacitance of metal oxide electrodes for supercapacitors. In this article, we review our recent efforts in developing a novel method to manipulate and fundamentally improve their electronic properties by controlled introduction of oxygen vacancies into metal oxides through thermal treatment under different conditions. Oxygen vacancies serve as shallow donors for metal oxides such as TiO2, WO3, and α-Fe2O3. The increased carrier density improves the electrical conductivity, and facilitates charge transfer at the interface between metal oxide and substrate, as well as the interface between metal oxide and electrolyte. Finally, we will also discuss the current challenges and future opportunities for these oxygen-deficient metal oxides as a new class of electrode materials for different applications.
2. Nanostructured metal oxides for photoelectrochemical water oxidation
PEC water splitting is an environmentally friendly and sustainable method to convert solar energy into chemical energy in the form of hydrogen gas.3,5–11 Since the solar driven water splitting based on TiO2 was reported by Fujishima and Honda in 1972,12 various semiconductor metal oxides such as TiO2,13–18 ZnO,19,20 WO321,22 and α-Fe2O323–26 based electrodes have been fabricated and investigated for PEC water oxidation. Fig. 1 shows the basic configuration of a PEC cell composed of a semiconductor photoanode and a Pt cathode. Under light illumination, photons with energy larger than the band-gap of the photoanode create electron–hole pairs in the semiconductor anode. The applied external potential and the band bending at the interface of the n-type semiconductor anode and the electrolyte promote the separation of photoexcited electrons and holes. While electrons will be transferred to the Pt cathode to reduce water and generate H2, holes accumulated at the semiconductor surface will be used for water oxidation to produce O2. Depending on the electronic band structure of the active electrode material, external potential may or may not need to be applied for PEC water splitting. To achieve efficient solar water splitting, the band-gap energy of the semiconductor anode should be larger than 1.23 eV, which is the theoretical value for water electrolysis. Furthermore, the semiconductor should have conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB) edges straddling the electrochemical potentials of E0 (H+/H2) and E0 (O2/H2O),5,7 in order to reduce the need for an external potential. In addition, the semiconductor anodes should be chemically stable during water photoelectrolysis. While TiO2, WO3, α-Fe2O3 and ZnO have been extensively investigated as electrode materials for PEC water oxidation,5,7 their solar-to-hydrogen (STH) conversion efficiencies are still relatively low because of their intrinsic limitations. For example, TiO2 and ZnO have favorable band-edge positions. However, their relatively large band-gap (>3.0 eV) limits the visible light absorption and thereby the STH conversion efficiency.16,19 By contrast, α-Fe2O3 is a semiconductor metal oxide with an indirect band-gap of 2.1 eV, which is favorable for visible light absorption. Nevertheless, its efficiency has been severely limited by its intrinsic material properties such as a short excited state lifetime (∼10 ps), short hole diffusion distance (2–4 nm) and low-lying conduction band (∼0.3 V below the water reduction potential).8,24,25,27

Various methods have been explored to enhance the performance of these metal oxides for PEC water splitting, including quantum dot sensitization,28–30 structural engineering18,20,22,31–35 and elemental doping.14,19,24–26,30,36,37 However, small band-gap semiconductor sensitizers such as CdS and CdSe quantum dots are not stable for PEC water oxidation. While hole scavengers can be added as sacrificial agents to stabilize these quantum dots, it is certainly not ideal to sacrifice chemicals for hydrogen generation.28–30 The recent development of nanostructured metal oxide electrodes improved their performance by increasing the effective surface area and decreasing the diffusion length for minority carriers, however it does not improve the intrinsic optical and electronic properties of the electrode materials. Moreover, doping is a promising method for manipulating the optical as well as the electronic properties of a semiconductor. The influence of dopants on the PEC performance of these common metal oxide semiconductors has been comprehensively studied.38–42 For example, nitrogen doping has been found to be an effective approach to increase the visible light absorption of ZnO19 and TiO243 by narrowing their optical band-gaps. Furthermore, the incorporation of silicon,26 tin24 or titanium25 doping significantly increases the PEC performance of α-Fe2O3 photoanodes by improving their electrical conductivities. Silicon and titanium dopants incorporate substitutionally at the Fe site and serve as shallow donors for α-Fe2O3. Although doping has been proved to be effective in manipulating the properties of metal oxides, the incorporation of dopants could be challenging, due to the size discrepancy between the dopant atom and the element of host crystal, especially for large sized metal atoms.
Recently, Chen et al. reported the preparation of hydrogenated black TiO2 nanoparticles.44 The black TiO2 exhibited visible light absorption, which was attributed to the surface disorder that narrowed the band-gap of TiO2. Black TiO2 showed substantially enhanced performance for organic dye degradation and photocatalytic hydrogen generation in the presence of sacrificial reagents.44 This work inspired us to study the effect of hydrogen treatment on metal oxide for PEC water oxidation. However, we used a different approach to enhance the performance of metal oxide electrode materials. Instead of increasing the visible light absorption of TiO2, we managed to increase the carrier densities and electrical conductivities of TiO2via controlled formation of oxygen vacancies in the host structure by thermal treatment in hydrogen or oxygen-deficient conditions.16,30 We demonstrated that this is a general strategy, which can increase the PEC performance for a number of metal oxides, including ZnO, TiO2, WO3 and α-Fe2O3.16,22,30,45,46 Oxygen vacancies function as shallow donors in these metal oxides and should be able to improve the electrical conductivities of metal oxides.47,48 This article will review our studies on the creation of oxygen vacancies in metal oxides and their influence on the performance of metal oxide photoanodes for PEC water oxidation.
2.1 Oxygen-deficient TiO2 nanowire arrays show substantially enhanced PEC performance
TiO2 as an n-type metal oxide semiconductor is the most widely investigated metal oxide for PEC and photocatalytic water splitting, due to its favorable band-edge position, superior chemical stability and natural abundance.16,18,28,31,36,37,44 An enormous amount of research effort has been centered on the development of element-doped, nanostructured TiO2 photoanodes. A number of crystalline TiO2 nanostructures, such as nanowire arrays,13,17,22,30,35 nanotube arrays49–52 and mesoporous structures53,54 have been prepared, with a goal of increasing the effective surface area of the active electrode material. Additionally, the use of various dopants such as nitrogen and carbon14,28,30,36,55 has been studied to narrow the TiO2 band-gap and increase the visible light absorption. Rutile and anatase TiO2 have band-gaps of 3.0 eV and 3.2 eV, respectively. Based on the band-gaps, their theoretical STH efficiencies should be 2.2% and 1.3%. However, the reported STH efficiencies for doped, nanostructured TiO2 photoanodes are still much lower than these theoretical limits. While TiO2 has been proved to be an efficient UV light absorber, these results suggest that the efficiency of charge separation and collection are low for TiO2. The inefficient charge collection is believed to be due to the poor electrical conductivity of TiO2. This motivated us to explore methods to increase the carrier density and electrical conductivity of TiO2. In previous studies, oxygen vacancies have been found to be a shallow donor for TiO2.47 Recently, we demonstrated that the PEC performance of TiO2 for water oxidation can be substantially enhanced through controlled introduction of oxygen vacancies into TiO2 nanostructures by hydrogen treatment.16,30 Dense and vertically aligned rutile TiO2 nanowires were synthesized by a hydrothermal method (Fig. 2a). The as-prepared TiO2 nanowires were annealed in air at 550 °C for 3 hours, follow by additional annealing in a hydrogen atmosphere in a home-built CVD system (Fig. 2b).56 As shown in Fig. 2c, the white color of pristine air-annealed TiO2 nanowire film changed to light yellow, yellow, gray and finally black when the hydrogen annealing temperature increased from 300 to 550 °C. This suggests that hydrogen treated samples have enhanced light absorption in the visible region.

As shown in Fig. 3a, hydrogen treated TiO2 (denoted as H-TiO2) samples exhibited significantly enhanced photocurrent densities in the entire potential window, compared to pristine TiO2. Enhancement of the photocurrent is related to the hydrogen annealing temperature. Incident-photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra collected for the H-TiO2 samples confirmed that the enhanced photocurrents after hydrogen treatment are mainly due to enhanced photoactivity in the UV region16 (Fig. 3b). These H-TiO2 samples showed insignificant visible light photoactivity in the wavelength above 450 nm, indicating that the transitions between localized oxygen vacancy states and the delocalized conduction band are inefficient.16 More importantly, the limited photoactivity in visible light also suggests that the enhanced PEC performance of TiO2 was a result of improved charge collection efficiency. By integrating the measured IPCE spectrum with the standard AM 1.5G solar spectrum (ASTM G-173-03) (Fig. 3c), the H-TiO2 exhibited a maximum STH conversion efficiency of 1.1% at −0.6 V vs. Ag/AgCl.16 This integrated STH efficiency is independent of the light source for PEC measurement.57 To our knowledge, this is the highest STH conversion efficiency reported for TiO2, under a standard solar spectrum.

The improved charge collection efficiencies were ascribed to the increased electrical conductivity of H-TiO2 samples. Electrochemical impedance measurements (Mott–Schottky plots) showed that H-TiO2 exhibited donor densities of TiO2 enhanced by three orders of magnitude compared to pristine TiO2 (Fig. 3d). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis confirmed that a portion of Ti4+ was reduced to Ti3+ (oxygen vacancies) during hydrogenation.16 Oxygen vacancies served as shallow donors47,48 and thereby increased the donor densities of TiO2. This is consistent with the Mott–Schottky results.16 Furthermore, hydrogenated anatase TiO2 nanotube arrays were also prepared and tested for PEC water oxidation. Likewise, they showed substantially enhanced photocurrents compared to their pristine counterparts. Hydrogenation was proved to be a general strategy to increase the carrier density and photoactivity for both rutile and anatase TiO2 structures.
Alternative methods have been explored to introduce oxygen vacancies into TiO2. For instance, oxygen vacancies can be generated by annealing metal oxide in an oxygen-deficient condition.58 The as-prepared TiO2 nanowires were annealed in vacuum (13 mTorr) in a home-built tube furnace at 550 °C for 3 hours.30 In comparison to the hydrogenation method, this approach eliminates the potential influence of hydrogen impurities and therefore allows separate study of the function of oxygen vacancies for the PEC performance of TiO2. XPS analysis confirmed the formation of oxygen vacancies in vacuum annealed TiO2 nanowires (denoted as V-TiO2). Fig. 4 compares the PEC and electrochemical performances of air annealed TiO2 and V-TiO2. There was an almost two fold enhancement in the photocurrent densities and IPCE values for V-TiO2, compared to the air annealed sample prepared at the same temperature. Mott–Schottky studies showed that V-TiO2 has substantially increased the donor density. Similar enhancements in carrier density and photocurrent were also observed for TiO2 nanowires annealed in other oxygen deficient conditions such as an argon atmosphere.30 These results unambiguously demonstrated that the incorporation of oxygen vacancies can significantly improve the electrical conductivity and PEC performance of TiO2 electrodes.

2.2 Oxygen-deficient WO3 nanoflakes show superior photostability
In comparison to TiO2, WO3 has a relatively small band-gap (2.6 eV), which is more favorable for visible light absorption.15,21,22,33,59–61 However, WO3 is an indirect band-gap semiconductor, which requires a relatively thick film for absorbing a significant portion of light. A thick layer of active electrode material usually causes significant electron–hole recombination loss and decreased photoactivity, and therefore efficient charge transport is highly desirable for WO3. Furthermore, WO3 also suffers from OH− induced chemical dissolution in basic (pH > 4) aqueous solution62,63 as well as photocorrosion induced by the peroxo-species created during water oxidation.64 Recent studies showed that the photostability of WO3 electrodes can be improved by depositing a layer of oxygen evolution catalyst, such as cobalt and manganese based catalysts, on the WO3 surface.21,64 The oxygen evolution catalysts not only suppress the formation of peroxide species on the electrode surface, but also reduce the over-potential of the WO3 photoelectrode for water oxidation.64 Nevertheless, the catalyst coating could block light penetration into the WO3 electrode and cause a reduction in its photoactivity.
We have recently demonstrated that the creation of oxygen vacancies in WO3 not only improves its photoactivity for water oxidation, but also helps to stabilize the WO3 electrode materials without the need for an oxygen evolving catalyst coating.22 Powder X-ray diffraction studies showed that oxygen vacancies were created by annealing WO3 nanoflakes in a hydrogen atmosphere. When the annealing temperature increased from 300 to 500 °C, the WO3 nanoflakes were converted into substoichiometric tungsten oxides, WO2.9 and WO2.92 (Fig. 5a). XPS studies confirmed the presence of lower oxidation states W5+ (oxygen vacancies) in hydrogen-treated WO3 samples.22 The optimized hydrogen-treated WO3 sample (annealed at 350 °C) showed a 10-fold enhanced photocurrent density compared to pristine WO3, at 1.2 V vs. Ag/AgCl (Fig. 5b). IPCE studies revealed that the increased photocurrent is due to the improved photoactivity at wavelengths below 480 nm. This indicates that the optical band-gap of WO3 remained unchanged and the photocurrent enhancement was ascribed to the improved efficiency of charge collection.22 Mott–Schottky studies showed that the hydrogen-treated samples have much higher donor densities than pristine WO3 (Fig. 5c). More importantly, hydrogen-treated WO3 exhibited excellent stability without obvious photoactivity loss for at least 7 hours, while untreated WO3 retained only 20% of its initial photoactivity after 2 hours (Fig. 5d). The excellent photostability was attributed to the formed substoichiometric WO3−x, which is chemically stable in the presence of peroxide species and difficult to re-oxidize at room temperature.65,66

2.3 Oxygen vacancies boost the performance of α-Fe2O3 photoanode
α-Fe2O3 is a promising semiconductor electrode material for PEC water oxidation because of its favorable band-gap of ∼2.1 eV, with a maximum theoretical STH conversion efficiency of 15%.57 Moreover, it is chemically stable in an aqueous solution and oxidative environment, non-toxic, abundant and inexpensive.24,25,67–69 However, the performance of the α-Fe2O3 electrode is limited due to its poor electrical conductivity, low absorption coefficient,70 short diffusion length for holes (2–4 nm),68 short excited-state lifetime (<10 ps),71 poor surface oxygen evolution kinetics,72 and low-lying conduction band.5,69 To overcome these limitations, a number of methods have been explored. For instance, nanostructured α-Fe2O3 electrodes have been developed to reduce the diffusion length for holes, as well as increase the effective surface area.8,69,73 Elemental doping (e.g. Si,26,70,74 Sn,4,24,75,76 Ti,25,76etc.) has been reported for improving the morphology, optical absorption and electrical conductivity of α-Fe2O3. Significantly, our recent studies showed that the performance of the α-Fe2O3 nanowire-arrayed electrode can be boosted by simply modifying the oxygen content during the thermal annealing process. The α-Fe2O3 nanowires were synthesized by a hydrothermal method that has been reported elsewhere.77 Akaganeite (β-FeOOH) nanowires were first prepared through the hydrolysis of FeCl3 precursors. These β-FeOOH nanowires can be converted into α-Fe2O3 by annealing them in air at elevated temperatures such as 550 °C. However, a pristine α-Fe2O3 electrode (without doping) created at 550 °C typically shows poor PEC performance and the material needs to be activated at a higher temperature, such as at 800 °C.24 High temperature annealing is an energy intensive process, which is not favorable for the fabrication of PEC electrodes. Therefore, we were motivated to improve the photoactivity of the α-Fe2O3 electrode without the need for high temperature activation. We anticipated that the thermal decomposition of these β-FeOOH nanowires in an oxygen-deficient atmosphere can create oxygen vacancies. The presence of Fe2+ sites (oxygen vacancies) in α-Fe2O3 can significantly increase its electrical conductivity via a polaron hopping mechanism.78,79 Comparative studies were carried out for α-Fe2O3 nanowire samples prepared via thermal decomposition of hydrothermally grown β-FeOOH nanowires at 550 °C in air (denoted as A-hematite) and an oxygen-deficient atmosphere (mixture of N2 and air) (denoted as N-hematite), respectively.46 The existence of Fe2+ sites in the N-hematite sample was confirmed by XPS analysis (Fig. 6a). Mott–Schottky studies (Fig. 6b) showed that the donor density of N-hematite is an order of magnitude higher that of A-hematite. As shown in Fig. 6c, N-hematite nanowires exhibited a significantly enhanced photocurrent compared to the A-hematite sample. N-hematite also yielded higher IPCE values than that of A-hematite in the entire wavelength range between 320 and 610 nm (Fig. 6d). The IPCE value decreases to zero at 610 nm, which is consistent with the optical band-gap of hematite, suggesting that the incorporation of oxygen vacancies did not narrow the band-gap.

This work presented a novel and effective method to increase the electrical conductivity of α-Fe2O3 materials. Significantly, we found that the presence of chloride ions (from FeCl3 precursor solution) plays an important role in the creation of Fe2+ sites in hematite under an oxygen-deficient environment.46 β-FeOOH is a three-dimensional tunnel structure, which typically contains chloride ions and protons in the inner space of the tunnels. The captured chloride ions can be released in the form of hydrogen chloride by reaction with the water molecules produced by dehydroxylation upon thermal treatment. This reaction produces oxygen as a side-product and releases four electrons. These released electrons can reduce Fe3+ to Fe2+. The amount of Fe2+ is related to the oxygen content during the annealing process. Fig. 7 shows that a black magnetite (Fe3O4) film containing more Fe2+ sites than N-hematite can be achieved by annealing the as-prepared β-FeOOH sample in a pure nitrogen atmosphere.46 In contrast, we were still able to obtain red hematite films from the thermal decomposition of β-FeOOH in nitrogen when the FeCl3 precursor was replaced with Fe(NO3)3.46 This experiment confirms that an oxygen deficient environment and the presence of chloride ions are essential for the creation of Fe2+ sites. This method demonstrated a simple and effective strategy for the preparation of highly conducting and photo-effective α-Fe2O3 for PEC water splitting.

3. Oxygen-deficient metal oxide nanostructures for other applications
3.1 Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution
The oxygen-deficient metal oxide nanostructures have also been studied for photocatalytic hydrogen generation with the addition of hole scavengers such as methanol, sulfide and urea.44,45,80 Chen et al. reported that the hydrogenated black TiO2 nanoparticles showed enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen evolution with methanol as a hole scavenger.44 Recently, we also reported the influence of hydrogenation on the photocatalytic properties of ZnO nanorods.45 ZnO has been extensively studied for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution because it has favorable band-edge positions that straddle the redox potential of water photoelectrolysis, and it is inexpensive and environmentally friendly. Nevertheless, the efficiency of ZnO for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution is limited (200–2000 μmol h−1 g−1) by its wide band-gap and rapid recombination of photo-generated carriers. By annealing ZnO nanorods in hydrogen, we introduced oxygen vacancies and hydrogen impurities into ZnO, and these impurities can increase the carrier density of ZnO and facilitate the transport of photoexcited charge carriers. We reported the growth of hydrogenated ZnO (denoted H-ZnO) nanorods on a solid substrate and their implementation as photocatalysts for hydrogen evolution. The H-ZnO nanorods grown on FTO glass substrates yielded a benchmark specific hydrogen production rate of 122500 μmol h−1 g−1 (Fig. 8a). Furthermore, the immobilization of ZnO nanorod arrays on a substrate prevents aggregation of ZnO active materials and eliminates the tedious separation and recovery processes that are essential for ZnO powder samples. As shown in Fig. 8b, hydrogen production shows a linear relationship with illumination time, indicating continuous gas production. The data also prove that the H-ZnO nanorod-arrayed electrode has excellent stability and recyclability. This work demonstrated that hydrogenation is an effective approach to enhance the photocatalytic performance of the ZnO photocatalyst. Furthermore, other metal oxide materials have also been explored for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. For example, we recently reported that hydrogen can be released from urea and human urine with the assistance of Ni(OH)2 modified oxygen-deficient α-Fe2O3 and TiO2.80 Again, the creation of oxygen vacancies improved the performance of the metal oxide electrodes.

3.2 Oxygen-deficient TiO2 electrodes show improved specific capacitance and stability for supercapacitors
Supercapacitors are emerging as a new class of energy storage device. They have higher power densities than lithium ion batteries, higher energy densities than conventional capacitors and excellent long-term stability.81–87 Metal oxide based pseudo-capacitors, such as MnO2 and NiO, have a large specific capacitance; however, the poor electrical conductivity of these metal oxides can cause gradual loss of capacitance.81,82,88 To address this issue, metal oxides are typically mixed with highly conductive carbon materials to form composite electrodes.84–86 Significantly, the introduction of oxygen vacancies provides a unique opportunity to fundamentally address this challenge by increasing the electrical conductivity of metal oxides, without the need for carbon additives. We demonstrated this concept by using TiO2 as an example.89 Anatase TiO2 nanotube arrays were fabricated on Ti metal fibers using an electrochemical anodization method. These TiO2 samples were further annealed in a hydrogen atmosphere. XPS analysis confirmed the formation of Ti3+ in the TiO2 host crystal and surface hydroxyl groups, indicating the successful incorporation of oxygen vacancies. In addition to the increased carrier density, the formation of hydroxyl groups can also increase the pseudocapacitance of TiO2.89Fig. 9a shows the cyclic voltammetry curves of as-prepared TiO2, air annealed TiO2 and hydrogen-treated TiO2 (denoted as H-TiO2) nanotube arrays. Importantly, the H-TiO2 sample shows substantially enhanced current densities, compared to the other two samples. The calculated per-area capacitance for H-TiO2 electrode reaches 3.24 mF cm−2, which is 124 and 40 times higher than the values obtained for untreated (0.026 mF cm−2) and air annealed TiO2 (0.08 mF cm−2), respectively.89 The enhanced electrochemical performance can be attributed to the improved electrical conductivity and increased pseudo-capacitance of H-TiO2. The improved electrochemical performance was also supported by galvanostatic charge–discharge tests performed under different current densities. The charge–discharge time of H-TiO2 was substantially extended over the other electrodes, revealing the good capacitive behavior of H-TiO2 (Fig. 9c). Finally, the enhanced electrical conductivity of the electrode material also improved the charging–discharging cycling stability of H-TiO2. The H-TiO2 sample exhibited excellent long-term cycling stability, with only 3.1% capacitance loss after 10000 cycles. In contrast, TiO2 and air-annealed TiO2 lost over 44.3% and 34.8% of their capacitance.89

In addition, oxygen-deficient TiO2 has recently been explored for lithium ion battery application.90 Shin et al. found that hydrogen-treated TiO2 exhibited a three times enhancement of lithium ion storage capability, and substantially improved rate capability.90 Their electrochemical impedance spectroscopy studies suggested that the excellent lithium ion storage performance of H-TiO2 is due to the enhanced electrical conductivity of TiO2.
4. Perspective
These latest studies have demonstrated that the controlled introduction of oxygen vacancies is a general strategy for increasing the electrical conductivity of metal oxides, including TiO2, WO3, α-Fe2O3 and ZnO. This concept could be extended to other semiconductors. For example, metal titanates such as SrTiO3 have a favorable band edge position for PEC water splitting,91 while its application is limited by its large band-gap, as well as poor electrical conductivity.92,93 Theoretical studies showed that oxygen vacancies are shallow donors for SrTiO3.94,95 Therefore, it is expected that the PEC performance of SrTiO3 could be improved by the incorporation of oxygen vacancies. Furthermore, a similar idea can be applied to metal sulfides, in which sulfur vacancies typically serve as shallow donors for the metal sulfides.96,97 The metal sulfide electrodes with increased electrical conductivity and photoactivity could be important for sulfide solar cell applications. A major challenge would be the quantification of oxygen vacancies in metal oxides and the establishment of a relationship between the concentration of oxygen vacancies and the carrier density, as well as the PEC performance of metal oxides. Currently, the PEC performance of oxygen-deficient metal oxides was tuned by annealing conditions such as temperature and time. XPS analysis was used to identify the existence of oxygen vacancies such as Ti3+ and W5+ on the metal oxide surfaces, but this surface analytical technique is not able to quantify the number and distribution of oxygen vacancies. Quantification of the concentration of oxygen vacancies will lead to a fundamental understanding of the effect of oxygen vacancies on the optical and electronic properties of oxygen-deficient metal oxide.
Coupling of the oxygen-deficient metal oxides with elemental doping,19 dye/quantum dot sensitization28,53 and metal nanoparticles98 could be a future research direction. Although the photoactivities of metal oxides can be substantially enhanced by the incorporation of oxygen vacancies, it was not able to narrow the electronic band-gap of metal oxides. Therefore, there is still a large room for improving their photoactivity by increasing visible light absorption, especially for wide band-gap metal oxides such as ZnO and TiO2. For example, Hoang et al. recently reported that co-treatment with nitrogen and hydrogen simultaneously improved the optical and electronic properties of metal oxides.55 The synergistic effect between nitrogen doping and hydrogen treatment on TiO2 nanowire arrays increased the photoactivity of TiO2 in both the UV and visible light regions.55 Moreover, theoretical simulation would be critical to advance our understanding of the interplay between oxygen vacancies and other dopants, as well as providing guidance on experimental efforts. Furthermore, oxygen-deficient metal oxide can be integrated with sensitizers, including dye molecules and quantum dots, to increase visible light photoactivities. In addition, metal nanoparticles have been demonstrated to be alternative sensitizers by surface plasmonic effects.98 The understanding of electron transfer between the oxygen-deficient metal oxide and these sensitizers would be important for the design of these composite materials.
Additionally, oxygen-deficient metal oxides could be used as photocatalysts or electrode materials for other applications. While we have demonstrated the potential of oxygen-deficient TiO2 for supercapacitors, the influence of oxygen vacancies on the performance of other common and important electrochemically active materials such as RuO2, SnO2 and MnO2 for supercapacitor and lithium ion battery applications is still unexplored. Importantly, these metal oxides have relatively poor electrical conductivities that have limited their capacitance for charge storage. Besides, their ability to manipulate the electronic properties of metal oxides would also be important for other applications, such as electrochemical catalysis, sensors and thermoelectric devices.99–102 For example, the applications of metal oxides such as MnO2 and NiO as oxygen evolution catalysts and electrochemical glucose sensor materials99,103 are restricted by their poor electrical conductivity. The introduction of oxygen vacancies to increase the conductivities of metal oxides could open up new opportunities in these research areas.

 	Fig. 8  (a) Photocatalytic hydrogen production rate collected for ZnO nanorod film, H-ZnO nanorod film and H-ZnO nanorods (powder) in an aqueous solution mixture containing 0.1 M Na2SO3 and 0.1 M Na2S under white light irradiation (300 W Xe lamp without a filter). (b) Cycling performance of H-ZnO NRA films. For each cycle (5 h), the photocatalytic experiment was stopped by turning off the light and the hydrogen gas in the reactor was evacuated. The dashed lines represent the start of a new cycle. Reproduced with permission from ref. 45, Copyright 2012, The Royal Society of Chemistry.	 

 	Fig. 9  (a) CV curves of the untreated TiO2, air-annealed TiO2 and H-TiO2, collected at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. (b) Calculated per-area capacitance of the TiO2 samples as a function of the scan rate. (c) Galvanostatic charge–discharge curves and (d) cycling performance of these TiO2 samples at a current density of 100 μA cm−2.
