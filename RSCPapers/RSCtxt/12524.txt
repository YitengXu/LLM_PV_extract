    , Accepted 11th January 2022First published on 12th January 2022AbstractHerein, we introduce a new concept of photo-assisted electrochemical CO2 reduction through a translucent thin film electrode. The light-compatible thin film electrode directly exposes Au nanoparticle-loaded Ag nanowires to gaseous CO2, obtaining a CO production rate of 0.7 mmol cm−2 h−1 with a photocurrent density of 6.05 mA cm−2 at −1.1 VRHE.
Carbon capture and utilization processes are presently the subjects of intense investigation. Among the numerous physical and chemical CO2 conversion methods, electrochemical CO2 reduction has received much attention as a potential ‘carbon-negative’ process, as the power can be provided through renewable electricity generated from a solar cell or wind power.1–3 Recent developments in electrochemical CO2 reduction have utilized two notable systems: one using gas diffusion electrodes (GDE) and the other using a photoelectrochemical (PEC) system.4–6 The GDE employs a conductive and porous support structure, such as carbon paper or a metal mesh, on which the electrocatalysts are deposited.7–9 The gaseous CO2 can directly access the catalyst surface for reduction, thus poor CO2 solubility in the aqueous electrolyte barely hinders the CO2 reduction. On the other hand, the PEC systems use both light and electricity to improve energy efficiency.10–12 In particular, when visible light is used, the current applied for CO2 reduction can be significantly increased. Here, we aim to combine the two approaches, of GDE and PEC, to reduce CO2 efficiently.
The obstacles to realizing this combined system of GDE and PEC should be addressed. These include (1) how the light is irradiated in the system and (2) which material is used to catalyze the electrochemical CO2 reduction with light. To configure the system components for light irradiation, the photoelectrode should be directly exposed to the light with a compact arrangement. The shorter light path will be beneficial to increase the light-to-chemical conversion.13–15 However, bringing light to the catalyst on the gas-permeable GDE is difficult. Currently, carbon-based materials such as carbon paper are typically used for GDE. The light cannot penetrate these materials, and instead the absorbed light increases the system temperature. This temperature increase is undesirable because the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is promoted at higher temperatures.16,17Kobayashi et al. reported an electrolyzer cell setup in which the cathode GDE chamber was cooled with ice water while the light was irradiated into the anode chamber.18 However, there has been yet no report of a GDE, through which light can penetrate.
As for the materials for the photo-electrochemical CO2 reduction, various semiconductors with proper band-gap energy and charge separation capability have been studied for PEC.19–21 Metal nanoparticles with local surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) have also been tested. Jain et al. reported that gold nanoparticles could convert CO2 to methane and ethane using high photon energy and flux.22McCloskey et al. reported that a silver nanostructure formed on glass by e-beam could induce CO2 reduction to CO, formate, and methanol.23
This work presents a photo-assisted electrochemical CO2 reduction electrolyzer with a photo-responsive thin film electrode (TFE). The TFE was fabricated with Ag nanowires in which metal nanoparticles were deposited. The network formed with Ag nanowires provided good electrical conduction while allowing gaseous CO2 diffusion. The electrolyzer exhibited enhanced current density upon light irradiation with selective CO production.
The photo-assisted electrochemical CO2 reduction (PAEC) cell was designed to enable the direct electrochemical reduction of gaseous CO2 aided by light. Fig. 1a and Fig. S1a (ESI†) show a photograph and the overall scheme of the fabricated PAEC cell. The cell consists of a gas chamber (15 mL), in which CO2 flows in and gaseous products flow out, and an electrolyte chamber (35 mL), filled with 1 M KOH solution. The reference electrode and anode are located in other compartments inside the electrolyte chamber (the compartments are connected) as shown in Fig. 1b. The working electrode is located between the gas chamber and the electrolyte chamber in the form of a thin film. The reference electrode is located beside the working electrode, but the anode is separated to minimize the effect of O2, which is produced at the anode by the oxygen evolution reaction. The overall cell was made to be as compact as possible while accommodating the electroanalytic components and connections.24 To avoid pressure build-up, gas-outlets were also built in the electrolyte chamber. The area of the working electrode in contact with the electrolyte solution was 2.01 cm2. A more detailed description of the PAEC cell fabrication can be found in the ESI.†

(b) A lateral cross-sectional scheme of the PAEC cell shows the positions of the cathode, anode, and reference electrode, as indicated. ★ indicates a thermostat insertion point, and ♦ indicates O2 exit point from the anode. (c) A cross-section of the PAEC cell shows light irradiated through the back window and the gas chamber. 
Both the gas chamber and the electrolyte chamber have a quartz window to provide a pathway for the light. Typical PECs have a window in the electrolyte vessel, so that the light passed through the electrolyte solution can reach to the catalyst surface, as shown in Fig. S1b (ESI†). Here, we instead irradiated light onto the gas chamber as shown in Fig. 1c. This allows the light to reach the active site where the gas, electrolyte, and catalyst meet together more efficiently. A Xe lamp was used with a UV filter (385 nm) and an IR filter (900 nm).
The working electrode should have active sites on which gas (CO2), electrolyte (H2O/OH−), and electrons meet efficiently. Specifically, it should contain the catalyst that enables CO2 reduction, should be photo-responsive and conductive for the photoelectrochemical reaction, and should enable hydroxide ions to be mobile. Conventionally, carbon-based materials with high porosity and conductivity have been used for the gas diffusion electrode.25 However, light cannot penetrate the carbon layer, but rather it is absorbed in the carbon. We avoided carbon-based materials to prepare the working electrode and instead, used Ag nanowires (Ag NW) to form a conductive network. Sustainion was chosen as a binder material because it is transparent and allows the transport of water and hydroxide ions while providing the structural integrity of a self-standing film. Fig. 2a shows the TFE consisting of a catalyst layer, which is based on Ag NW and exposed to gaseous CO2, and the Sustainion layer, which is exposed to 1 M KOH solution. The catalyst ink was prepared by mixing Ag NW-based nanomaterials with a Sustainion binder. The ink was sprayed onto Al foil. After drying, the Sustainion solution was again sprayed and dried. The thin film could be easily exfoliated by immersing the Al foil in 1 M KOH solution. A photograph of the translucent self-standing film is shown in Fig. 2b. A cross-section of the thin film was observed by SEM and TEM as shown in Fig. 2c and d. The overall thickness of the thin film was 3–4 μm and the thickness of the catalyst layer was ∼250 nm. Fig. S2 (ESI†) provides SEM images of the TFE, showing top views of the catalyst layer and the Sustainion layer along with additional images of a cross-sectional view of the TFE. The catalyst layer possesses a highly porous feature, while the Sustainion layer is smooth. This unique configuration of electrode allows direct light irradiation onto the interface where gaseous CO2 and catalyst meet, unlike conventional PEC (Fig. S3, ESI†).

(e) SEM image showing the top view (catalyst layer side) of the TFE. Au NP/Ag NW catalyst was used to form the TFE. 
Fig. S4 (ESI†) shows the change in current density and temperature upon light irradiation when the TFE was used in the PAEC cell. A Xe lamp was used; the IR and UV wavelength ranges were cut-off by IR and UV filters. When a carbon paper was used as the working electrode, upon light irradiation at −0.7 VRHE, the current density was small and a significant increase in temperature was observed, from 22.4° to 34.0° (Δ = 11.6°). The slight increase in current density upon light irradiation was due to the increase in cell temperature, accelerating mass transport, and reaction kinetics. The temperature increase was much smaller for the TFE. When the light was irradiated from the electrolyte chamber side, the temperature increased from 22.2° to 29.6° (Δ = 7.4°). When the light was irradiated from the gas chamber side, the temperature increased from 22.2° to 28.3° (Δ = 6.1°). Though not completely removed, the photothermal effect was significantly alleviated by using the TFE and changing the direction of light irradiation. Exposing the catalyst layer to the gas phase allowed the light to be irradiated directly onto the catalyst, shortening the light path and reducing heat accumulation.
The metal nanoparticles (Au, Pd, Ru) were additionally deposited on the Ag NW by galvanic replacement. The detailed synthetic method is described in the ESI.† Fig. S5 (ESI†) shows TEM images of pristine Ag NW, Au NP/Ag NW, Pd NP/Ag NW, and Ru NP/Ag NW. The sizes of the Au and Pd nanoparticles were ∼10 nm, while the Ru NP were much larger of ∼50 nm. Separate metal nanoparticles were not observed, but all the nanoparticles were located on the Ag NW. Fig. 2e shows a top view SEM image of the TFE made of the Au NP/Ag NW catalyst. The geometry of the nanowire network and the formation of nanoparticles on the nanowires can be confirmed. The UV-Vis spectra of the catalysts are shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†). The catalysts showed absorption peaks in the visible light region. The ICP–AES results show that the metal (Au, Pd, Ru) content was 38, 39, and 31 wt% for Au NP/Ag NW, Pd NP/Ag NW, and Ru NP/Ag NW, respectively. XPS spectra of the catalysts are shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†). The Ru 3d peaks were overlapped with C 1s, so the Ru 3p peaks are demonstrated instead. Only metallic peaks were observed for Au and Pd, while weak oxide peaks were also observed for Ru. Ag 3d peaks were slightly shifted to lower binding energy when the metal nanoparticles were deposited, implying good electron transfer between the metal nanoparticles and Ag NW.26
Metal nanoparticles deposited on the Ag NW were used as catalysts to form the TFE, then the PAEC cell was operated using the TFE as a working electrode at a potential of −0.5∼−1.1 VRHE. 90% CO2 (balance N2) was continuously provided at a flow rate of 12 sccm. Within the range of interest, the catalysts showed a linear correlation for current density and potential, indicating that no chemical oxidation or reduction occurred (Fig. 3a). When the light was irradiated on the Au NP/Ag NW for 1 min, the current density increased (Fig. 3c). When the light was turned off, the current density went back to the original value. The immediate gain in current density upon the light irradiation suggests the light was directly involved in CO2 reduction, rather than an indirect thermal effect. The gain in current density was much smaller with the pristine Ag NW. Fig. 3d and Fig. S8b (ESI†) show the chronoamperometric change upon light on/off for the Pd NW/Ag NW and Ru NW/Ag NW, respectively; they also show a clear photo-response although the gain was smaller than that of Au. Fig. 3b shows the increase in the current density upon light irradiation (designated photocurrent density) for the pristine Ag NW and various metal nanoparticles. The Au NP/Ag NW presented the largest photocurrent density of 6.1 mA cm−2 at −1.1 VRHE. As the potential increased, the photocurrent density slightly increased. The full linear sweep voltammetry curves for Ag NW, Au NP/Ag NW, Pd NP/Ag NW, Ru NP/Ag NW are shown with or without light irradiation in Fig. S9 (ESI†).
 Fig. 3  (a) Current densities in dark condition and (b) photocurrent densities measured for various Ag NW-based catalysts. The current density with light irradiation (300 mW cm−2) is shown in Fig. S8a (ESI†). Chronoamperometric analysis of (c) Au NP/Ag NW and Ag NW and (d) Pd NP/Ag NW and Ag NW at −0.7 VRHE with light on/off cycles. 
Fig. S10a (ESI†) shows the faradaic efficiency (FE) for the products obtained in Fig. 3a. Only CO and H2 were formed. While pristine Ag NW, Au NP/Ag NW, and Pd NP/Ag NW produced CO and H2 with an approximate ratio of 3:1, the Ru NP/Ag NW produced H2 only. A very small CH4 peak was detected in gas chromatography for the Ru NP/Ag NW but the amount was negligible. The selectivity changed only a little upon light irradiation, as shown in Fig. S10b (ESI†). For the Au NP/Ag NW catalyst, CO FE and H2 FE were 79.5% and 26.8% in the dark condition at −0.7 VRHE. They changed to 73.5% and 31.0% with light irradiation. Fig. 4a shows the CO production rate with and without light irradiation. CO production was enhanced by light irradiation; the Au NP/Ag NW and Pd NP/Ag NW showed the highest CO production rate of 0.7 mmol cm−2 h−1 at −1.1 VRHE under the light.
 Fig. 4  (a) CO production rates obtained at various potentials with/without light irradiation. (b) Photocurrent densities plotted over various light intensities. The photocurrent density was obtained by estimating the difference in current density with and without light irradiation. (c) Durability test performed for the Au NP/Ag NW catalyst at −0.7 VRHE with a light intensity of 180 mW cm−2. Light was irradiated for 20 min followed by 10 min of dark condition, and this cycle was repeated. 
The photocurrent density was estimated at various light intensities, as shown in Fig. 4b. An energetic electron-driven chemical reaction would exhibit a linear relationship, whereas the photothermal effect would show an exponential relationship, originating from the Arrhenius relation.27,28 The photocurrent produced on the Au NP/Ag NW clearly showed a linear relationship crossing the origin, confirming that the photocurrent is driven by energetic electrons formed from LSPR on Au NPs. But the pristine Ag NW and Pd NP/Ag NW showed some deviation, implying that the photothermal effect was also affecting the photocurrent.
The durability of the PAEC cell was tested using the Au NP/Ag NW catalyst as shown in Fig. 4c. The temperature inside the PAEC cell was carefully controlled to be in a range of 20–25 °C by exchanging a part of the electrolyte (15 mL) every 10 min. Also, the entire electrolyte solution was replaced every 3 h to remove gas bubbles and maintain pH. Fig. S11 (ESI†) shows the durability test results without the partial exchange of electrolyte solution. The CO production rate decreased significantly from 0.39 to 0.14 mmol cm−2 h−1 after 3 h. This decline was not due to catalyst degradation because the photocurrent did not change much. Instead, the temperature inside the cell increased from 19.6° to 34.7° and pH decreased from 14 to 9.6; these changes were responsible for the decrease in CO production rate. Fig. S12 (ESI†) shows a photograph of gas bubbles formed inside the PAEC cell. The electrolyte was fully exchanged to remove these bubbles. When the temperature was controlled and bubbles were removed by the electrolyte exchange, the CO production rate was stable at ∼0.4 mmol cm−2 h−1 for 12 h. The enhancement in CO production rate with light irradiation was also constant, without degradation over time. The PAEC cell operated stably, producing CO with light irradiation.
In conclusion, a new type of CO2 electrolysis cell was realized by combining the GDE and PEC systems. This TFE was fabricated by forming a gas-permeable photo-responsive catalyst layer based on Ag nanowires. When Au nanoparticles were deposited on the Ag nanowires by galvanic replacement, the catalyst showed the highest photocurrent of 6.05 mA cm−2 at −1.1 VRHE. CO was produced at a rate of 0.7 mmol cm−2 h−1 with light irradiation. This photocurrent is comparable to that of PEC systems using semiconductor catalysts, and an order of magnitude higher than that of the previously reported values using plasmonic catalysts (Table S1, ESI;†ref. 1 and 2). The PAEC cell operated stably as long as the cell temperature was controlled and gas bubbles were removed. Currently, we are trying to apply other types of photocatalysts into the PAEC cell and to develop an all gas-phase PAEC cell. These attempts may provide a breakthrough in energy-efficient CO2 reduction.
