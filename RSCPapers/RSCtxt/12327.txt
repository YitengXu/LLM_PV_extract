    , Accepted 6th August 2022First published on 8th August 2022AbstractThe conversion of nitrogen oxide (NO) by photocatalysis is promising to solve the increasingly serious air pollution. Herein, raspberry-like TiO2 hollow spheres consisting of small nanocrystals (less than 10 nm) were created using hollow carbon spheres as templates by controlling the synthesis parameters. These raspberry-like hollow spheres were well dispersed and revealed large specific surface area (172.6 m2 g−1) which was about 3 times that of commercial TiO2 powders (P25). The raspberry-like hollow spheres with an anatase phase composition and high crystallinity revealed high NO2 selectivity for NO conversion. Compared with P25, the hollow spheres exhibited excellent removal performance and high stability for NO, in which ∼60% of NO at a concentration of 600 ppb was removed while P25 removed ∼40% of NO. This is ascribed to the large specific surface area and pore volume, exposed (001) facets with high energy, and the reflection and scattering of light in the hollow sphere structure improving the utilization of light. Based on the diffuse reflection spectra, Mott–Schottky curves, and band gap structures, the removal mechanism is discussed.

Environmental significance
Large amounts of nitrogen oxides are produced in thermal power, industrial and transportation processes. Reducing emissions of nitrogen oxides is conducive to alleviating regional warming and improving air quality. Therefore, a clean and efficient method is urgently needed to remove nitrogen oxides. Photocatalytic oxidation as an efficient approach can remove nitrogen oxides. The photocatalytic activity of samples can be improved by changing the morphology of a TiO2 photocatalyst. By assembling TiO2 nanocrystals into raspberry-like hollow spheres, the contact area between nitrogen oxides and photocatalyst is increased, and light can be refracted in the hollow sphere cavities to improve the utilization rate of light. The raspberry-like TiO2 hollow spheres showed excellent photocatalytic oxidation performance for nitrogen oxides removal. The hollow spheres revealed excellent photocatalytic oxidation of NO compared with a commercial TiO2 catalyst (P25). The result is of much importance for the environment.

Introduction
Air pollution seriously endangers the natural environment and people's health, thus attracting more and more attention around the world.1,2 As some of the main pollutants of air, nitrogen oxides are mainly produced by the combustion process of fossil fuels such as automobile exhaust and thermal power.3–5 Nitrogen oxides not only cause damage to the human respiratory tract, but also cause cancer in severe cases. They are also important substances leading to acid rain and photochemical smog.6–8 NO accounts for more than 90% of nitrogen oxides, but the direct treatment of NO is very difficult.9,10 The usual treatment is to reduce NO emission or to convert NO into other easily treated nitrogen oxides.11,12 Pretreatment of fuels or reduction of nitrogen content can reduce the production of nitrogen oxides, but the application of these fuels is not ideal.13 TiO2 can transform the adsorbed H2O and O2 on the surface into oxidizing active species which can effectively remove NO.14
Photocatalysis as a low-cost, pollution-free technology is widely used in the removal of nitrogen oxides.15 Photocatalytic reduction of nitrogen oxides requires adding reducing agents during the reaction, which increases the cost.16 Removal of nitrogen oxides by photocatalytic oxidation can greatly reduce the cost of denitrification. Among various photocatalysts, TiO2 has attracted much attention because of its high photocatalytic stability, low cost, and it being harmless to the human body.17,18 However, TiO2 nanocrystals inevitably agglomerate to affect the light utilization and reduce photocatalytic efficiency.19,20 An effective method to improve the specific surface area of photocatalysts and reduce the agglomeration degree is by assembling TiO2 nanocrystals into different morphologies.21,22
In the past few years, hollow nanostructures with large specific surface areas have been reported.23,24 Among various morphologies of TiO2 prepared in recent years, TiO2 hollow spheres have attracted much attention due to their unique properties.25 TiO2 hollow spheres have been widely used in solar cells, lithium ion batteries, photocatalysts, and so on.26–29 TiO2 hollow spheres reveal excellent performance in photocatalytic degradation of antibiotics and organic dyes and in photocatalytic hydrogen production.30–32 However, TiO2 hollow spheres reported in the literature have relatively weak photocatalytic activity for NO oxidation.33,34 The assembly of TiO2 nanocrystals into hollow spheres is not only beneficial to the good dispersion of NO in photocatalysts, but also increases the specific surface area, prevents agglomeration, and improves the contact area between the light source and the photocatalyst.35,36 Due to the adsorption of reactants on the photocatalyst surface, P25 as TiO2 nanoparticle catalyst has poor stability for NO removal.37 Enhancing the gas adsorption and desorption properties of photocatalysts and reducing the agglomeration degree are conducive to improve the stability of photocatalysts.38
In this paper, raspberry-like TiO2 hollow spheres (THS) consisting of small nanocrystals were fabricated. The effect of synthesis conditions on the photocatalytic performance of samples was studied. Hollow carbon spheres coated with TiO2 particles were firstly synthesized at room temperature using hollow carbon spheres as templates. The template of carbon spheres was removed by calcination in air, and finally THS were obtained. The properties of TiO2 samples with this hollow spherical structure depended strongly on the specific surface area and pore volume, which were conducive to the full contact of samples with NO. THS samples made light reflect in the spherical cavity to improve the utilization of light. The NO removal rate of THS samples prepared using optimized conditions was up to 60% at 600 ppb NO concentration while that of P25 was just 40%.
Experimental section
Chemicals
The chemicals used in the experiments were of analytical purity and used without further treatment. Commercial TiO2 (P25, 99.9%) composed of 20% rutile and 80% anatase was purchased from Evonik Industries AG. Tetraethyl orthosilicate (28.4%), NaOH (96%), resorcinol (99.8%), ethanol (EtOH, 99.7%), and ammonia (27%) were supplied from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. Formaldehyde (38%) and butyl titanate (TBOT, 98%) were purchased from Aladdin Chemical Reagent Network. Deionized (DI) water was obtained using a Millipore water purifier.
Preparation of hollow carbon spheres
Hollow carbon spheres were prepared using SiO2 particles as templates which were obtained by using a Stöber method.39 A solution with 70 mL of ethanol, 10 mL of DI water, 3.46 mL of tetraethyl orthosilicate, and 3 mL of ammonia was prepared. After stirring for 15 min, 0.56 mL of formaldehyde was injected into the mixed solution and 0.4 g of resorcinol was added as carbon precursors with stirring at room temperature for 24 h. The resulting sample was washed several times using DI water until the solution became neutral. Black powder sample was finally obtained after drying at 70 °C overnight. The black powder sample was further calcined at 700 °C for 5 h in Ar atmosphere, and then added to 1 M NaOH solution with stirring at room temperature for 4 days. Hollow carbon spheres were obtained after washing and drying.
Preparation of THS
50 mg of hollow carbon spheres was added to 50 mL of EtOH with ultrasonication. 0.1 mL of TBOT was added drop by drop to this solution, repeating each 2 h. A total of 0.5 mL TBOT was finally added. The residual TBOT was washed using EtOH several times, and the resulting sample was dried overnight at 70 °C. Finally, the prepared TiO2@C hollow spheres were heated to 450 °C at a heat-treat rate of 10 °C min−1 in air for 2 h. The as obtained white powder sample was named as THS-1. The samples heat-treated at 450 °C for 4 h and 600 °C for 2 h were named THS-2 and THS-3, respectively. Sample THS-4 was prepared by directly adding 0.5 mL of TBOT. Table 1 illustrates the preparation technology of samples.

Characterization
To investigate the effect of preparation processes on the morphology of THS, the morphology of samples was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, QUANTA 250 FEG) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-2100plus). The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms of samples were measured to obtain the specific surface areas and porous structure by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method (ASIQC0000-4). To study the phase composition of samples, an X-ray diffraction (XRD) instrument (Bruker D8, Germany) was used. The elemental distribution and bonding mode of samples were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, SCALAB250). The absorption spectra of samples were measured with a UV-visible spectrophotometer (U-4100, Hitachi). The conduction band position of samples was estimated by Mott–Schottky curves using an electrochemical workstation (CHI660E, China). In situ FT-IR measurements were conducted using a Bruker INVENIO R FT-IR spectrometer equipped with an in situ diffuse reflectance cell (Harrick). The photoluminescence (PL) spectra were obtained using a fluorescence spectrophotometer (Hitachi F-4600). PL decay plots were obtained using a time-dependent single-photon counting spectrofluorometer system (λex = 370 nm, FluoroCube-01, JY-IBH, Horiba). Electron spin resonance (ESR, Bruker A300) was used to confirm the generation of radicals under solar light irradiation.
Photocatalytic removal of nitrogen oxides
Nitrogen oxide (NO) removal experiment was carried out using a nitrogen oxide analyzer (Thermo). 100 mg of sample was evenly dispersed in a culture dish. The culture dish was placed in a sealed reactor with a quartz cap. A xenon lamp (200 W) was placed on the reactor connected with a circulating water system to allow the photocatalytic reaction to be carried out at constant temperature. The 500 ppm compressed NO gas was diluted to 600 ppb with air and then the mixture was let into the reaction vessel. Determination of total residue and reaction products of NO was by a nitrogen oxide analyzer.
Results and discussion

Scheme 1 shows the formation process of THS samples. SiO2 spheres exhibit uniform size and size distribution. However, they are not conducive to the direct growth of TiO2 because of their relatively smooth surface.40,41 The use of a surfactant during synthesis meant that TiO2 not only grew on the surface of SiO2, but also generated TiO2 aggregates.42 TiO2 proved to be easy to grow on the surface of solid carbon spheres. Because of their uneven size, TiO2 hollow spheres prepared using solid carbon spheres as templates normally have a broad size distribution.43 Therefore, we synthesized SiO2 spheres coated with a carbon layer as precursors. The hollow carbon sphere templates were obtained by etching SiO2 using 1 M NaOH solution at room temperature. By adding a small amount of TBOT drop by drop, TiO2 dispersed slowly on the surface of the hollow carbon spheres. Finally, THS were obtained by calcining the hollow carbon sphere templates. The control of Ti precursor, calcination temperature, and time affected the morphology of samples. SEM and TEM images of samples prepared at each step were obtained to elucidate the situation.

Fig. 1a shows the XRD patterns of THS samples and P25. The characteristic peaks of rutile TiO2 were not found for THS, and the XRD peaks at 25.3°, 38°, 47.8°, and 54.8° corresponded to the (101), (004), (105), and (204) planes of anatase TiO2, respectively.44 The composition of P25 not only contained anatase, but also included the XRD peaks of (110), (101), (111), and (220) crystal planes of rutile, which were located at 27.5°, 36.1°, 41.3°, and 56.7°, respectively.45 Compared with THS-4, the XRD peaks of THS-1 were more sharp, which indicated the poor crystallinity of THS-4. The binding energy of THS was further understood by XPS. Fig. 1b shows the XPS survey spectra of THS and P25, which clearly revealed the existence of elements Ti and O. Raman spectra of THS-1 and P25 show that no D band and G band peaks of carbon at ∼1300 and ∼1580 cm−1 were observed, suggesting the C template was completely removed during synthesis (Fig. S1, ESI†).46 The peaks at 458.3 and 464.1 eV in the Ti 2p spectrum in Fig. 1c corresponded to the characteristic peaks of Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2, which indicated that the element Ti in THS-1 was in the form of Ti4+.47 Ti3+ formed by carbon doping was not found in all samples (Fig. S2a, ESI†). Fig. 1d shows the O 1s spectrum of THS-1, where the peaks at 526.9, 530.6, and 531.85 eV corresponded to Ti–O, Ti–OH, and adsorbed oxygen, respectively.48 Previous studies have reported that TiO2 with low crystallinity has a stronger ability to absorb water compared with crystalline TiO2.49 THS-4 revealed the strongest Ti–OH bonding, which was consistent with the results of XRD analysis (Fig. S2b, ESI†). Therefore, the direct addition of a large amount of Ti precursors resulted in the quick growth of TiO2 and decreased the crystallization of THS samples.

TEM and SEM images of P25 were obtained. The severe agglomeration degree of nanoparticles was not conducive to the contact between P25 and reactants (Fig. S3, ESI†). Fig. 2a shows the SEM image of hollow carbon spheres as the templates of THS with uniform size and size distribution. The size distribution of hollow carbon spheres and THS were obtained from TEM images. The average diameter of hollow carbon spheres was ∼260 nm (Fig. S4, ESI†). Since the hollow carbon sphere template shrunk and collapsed during calcination, calcination temperature and time greatly affect the morphology of synthesized THS. Fig. 2b to e show TEM images of THS-1. The images show that the hollow TiO2 spheres consisted of small nanocrystals with a diameter of about 8 nm. After calcination at 450 °C for 2 h, the size of THS-1 is controlled at about 155 nm (Fig. S4, ESI†), and the morphology of hollow spheres is mostly intact. Many pores were observed between the nanocrystals. Therefore, small nanocrystals resulted in THS with large specific surface area which may improve the surface absorption of light. The light also can enter into the cavities of the hollow spheres. The light was multiply scattered on the inner surface of a hollow sphere which greatly improves the utilization rate of light.50,51 Because THS-1 had a thin shell, the cavity of the hollow spheres also had high activity in the reaction with gas.52 The elemental mapping of THS-1 suggested that Ti and O were uniformly distributed in THS-1 (Fig. S5, ESI†). Fig. 2e shows the HRTEM image of THS-1. Not only were the lattice fringes of TiO2 (101) crystal plane observed, but also a large amount of (001) high-energy crystal planes were observed. The existence of these high-energy crystal planes greatly improved the photocatalytic performance of THS-1.53Fig. 2f and g show the TEM images of THS-2. When the calcination time was increased to 4 h, the size of THS was further reduced to about 135 nm, and the structure of hollow spheres was damaged. Fig. 2h and i show the TEM images of THS-3. When the calcination temperature was increased to 600 °C, the size of the hollow spheres collapsed to about 133 nm, and the hollow sphere structure of the sample was almost destroyed, suggesting that THS with uniform size can be prepared by using hollow carbon spheres as templates, but the calcination conditions for removing the template need to be controlled. TBOT has a high nucleation rate, and the agglomeration of TiO2 nanocrystals that are not nucleated on the template will occur when large amounts of Ti precursors were added to the template solution once.54 Controlling the rate of adding Ti precursors was helpful to improve the agglomeration of TiO2 nanocrystals and obtain uniform hollow spheres.

The specific surface area, pore size distribution, and pore volume of samples were studied by N2 adsorption and desorption experiments. An obvious hysteresis loop in the adsorption–desorption isotherms is observed in Fig. 3a, which is the characteristic of a type IV curve, indicating that both THS-1 and P25 are microporous structures.55 The specific surface areas and pore volumes of P25 and THS-1 are given in Table S1 (ESI†). Due to the special morphology and structure of THS, these nanocrystals have good dispersion and low agglomeration, so they have large specific surface area. The specific surface area of THS-1 was 172.6 m2 g−1, while that of P25 was only 60.6 m2 g−1 due to the high degree of aggregation.
 Fig. 3  (a) Nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms and (b) corresponding pore size distributions of samples. 
The larger specific surface area means that THS-1 has better contact with NO, and also more light is irradiated on the sample. Fig. 3b shows that the pore sizes of THS-1 and P25 are mainly about 2 nm (micropores) and 4 nm (mesopores), and the pore capacity of THS-1 is 2.95 times that of P25. Since THS-1 has a higher pore volume, it can significantly improve the adsorption and activation ability of the sample to NO, which is indispensable for the photocatalytic removal of gas pollutants.56
The photocatalytic NO removal performance of THS was studied. As shown in Fig. 4a, as a commercial TiO2 photocatalyst, P25 can remove 39.8% of NO. After 6 min, the NO concentration reached a constant value, which may be ascribed to a balance situation of NO oxidation. Although a homojunction can improve the separation efficiency of photogenerated electron–hole pairs in P25, the agglomeration of nanoparticles reduces the light utilization rate of the sample and the contact area with the reactants. THS-1 revealed the best NO removal efficiency, removing 59.4% of NO in 6 min. The special hollow spherical structure of THS-1 limited the agglomeration of nanocrystals and improved the specific surface area of samples. At the same time, THS-1 also had a large pore volume. In this way, the contact area between THS-1 and NO was increased, and the ability to adsorb and activate NO was enhanced, which was beneficial to the photocatalytic oxidation of NO. The light utilization rate of the sample was greatly improved by using the refraction and scattering of light inside the hollow spheres. After a large number of (001) high-energy crystal planes exposed on the surface of THS-1 were excited by light, the photocatalytic performance of the sample was further improved. When removing the hollow carbon sphere template, increasing the calcination time and calcination temperature enhanced the photocatalytic performance of samples. The damage to the hollow sphere morphology of THS-2 decreased the special light refraction effect in the hollow sphere structure, resulting in a slight decrease in NO removal rate. For THS-3, the morphology of hollow spheres was seriously damaged, the agglomeration degree was greatly increased, and only 36.5% of NO was removed. Due to the one-time addition of excess Ti source, the aggregation of THS-4 nanocrystals is high, and the size of THS is uneven. The thicker shell of the hollow spheres will affect the activity of the spheres, resulting in the decrease of the photocatalytic performance of the samples.52Table 2 illustrates that THS-1 exhibited excellent performance compared with catalysts reported in the literature.

Fig. 4b shows that THS-1 not only had excellent NO removal ability, but also can remove 56.83% of NO after twelve cycle stability tests, suggesting that THS-1 had high stability in the process of photocatalytic removal of gas pollutants. A free radical capture experiment with THS-1 was carried out to study the reaction mechanism of nitrogen oxides removal by samples. As shown in Fig. 4c, NO was almost not oxidized when O2− is captured, indicating that O2− was the most important active species. When e− and ˙OH were captured, the NO removal efficiency of THS-1 also decreased significantly. However, after h+ was captured, the NO removal ability of the sample was slightly improved. P25 revealed relatively low PL intensity while THS-1 exhibited the lowest PL intensity of the THS samples (Fig. S6a, ESI†). The PL decay plots of samples revealed similar results to PL spectra (Fig. S6b, ESI†). P25 revealed the shortest average lifetime. The average lifetime of THS-1 was short compared with THS-2, THS-3, and THS-4. This indicated that THS-1 has a higher electron–hole recombination rate than P25. This indicated that the excellent photocatalytic performance of THS-1 was mainly due to its unique morphology. Therefore, electrons are more involved in the reaction after h+ is captured to produce O2−. First, the sample produces photogenerated electrons and holes under simulated sunlight excitation. Adsorbed O2 on the sample surface reacts with electrons to form O2−, O2− reacts with NO to generate NO2, and NO2 continues to react with O2− to generate N2O5.63 O2− also reacts with H+ and e− to generate H2O2, and reacts with H2O2 to generate ˙OH. The oxidation of NO and NO2 to HNO2 and HNO3 is by ˙OH.64 The specific reaction process is shown in the following formulas: THS + hν → e− + h+(1) e− + O2 → ˙O2−(2) NO + ˙O2− → NO2(3) NO2 + ˙O2− → N2O5(4) ˙O2− + H+ + e− → H2O2(5) ˙O2− + H2O2 → ˙OH + OH−(6) NO + ˙OH → HNO2(7) NO2 + ˙OH → HNO3(8)
Weak photocatalytic activity always induces the generation of NO2, which is due to the incomplete oxidation of NO. Since NO2 is more toxic than NO and leads to greater damage to the environment, the production of NO2 should be minimized when NO is oxidized to NOx.65Fig. 4d shows that THS-1 has better NO removal efficiency than P25, and the reaction has lower selectivity for NO2, which is also a major advantage of using THS-1 for photocatalytic NO removal.
The active oxygen species produced by the samples were studied by ESR. Fig. 5a and b show that no peaks of ˙OH and ˙O2− were found under darkness. After 5 min illumination, signals of ˙OH and ˙O2− were observed in ESR spectra, which indicated that these two active species which play important roles in the photocatalytic oxidation of NO were generated by light. In order to prove the reaction mechanism during THS-1 photocatalytic oxidation of NO, in situ DRIFTS under simulated sunlight was conducted. As shown in Fig. 6, after 30 min of adsorption under dark conditions, an absorption peak at 1657 cm−1 was observed, which was the result of NO adsorption.66 As the photocatalytic process proceeds, a broad band at 1698 cm−1 appears which is the binding absorption band of NO and NO3− mixture.67,68 The absorption peaks at 1603 cm−1 and 1259 cm−1 corresponded to NO2 and N2O5, respectively.69,70 The weak absorption peaks at 1473 cm−1 and 1456 cm−1 were attributed to bidentate NO3−, while the absorption peak at 1577 cm−1 was attributed to monodentate NO3−.71,72 The absorption peak observed at 1398 cm−1 was attributed to NO2−, indicating that HNO2 was included in the product.73 The absorption peak at 1304 cm−1 was attributed to HNO3.70 The above results were consistent with formulas (1)–(8).

Fig. 7a shows the UV-visible diffuse reflection spectra. THS-1 and P25 can only be excited by UV light. After the diffuse reflection spectral data were processed by formula (9), the results are shown in the inset in Fig. 7a. The band gaps of THS-1 and P25 are 3.29 and 3.22 eV, respectively. Due to the rutile–anatase homojunction formed in P25, the band gap width is smaller than that of THS-1 composed of pure anatase. ahν = A(hν − Eg)n(9)In formula (9), α, h, ν, A, and Eg are absorption coefficient, Planck's constant, light frequency, constant, and band gap, respectively.74 Because anatase TiO2 is an indirect semiconductor, the n value is 1/2. The conduction band position of the valence band of the samples was determined using Mott–Schottky curves. As shown in Fig. 7b, the CB of THS-1 and P25 were −0.723 and −0.745 eV, respectively, which are both less than −0.33 eV and indicative of the ability to produce O2−.75

Scheme 2 illustrates the possible mechanism of NO removal using THS photocatalysts. After the sample was stimulated by simulated sunlight, photogenerated electrons generate a large amount of O2− and ˙OH through a series of reactions, and NO is oxidized by active species to other nitrogen oxides for easy treatment. Due to the special morphology of THS, the agglomeration degree of nanocrystals is greatly reduced, and larger specific surface area and pore volume are conducive to the adsorption and activation of NO by the sample. The hollow sphere structure of THS can make light refract in the cavity. With the help of a large number of high-energy crystal faces exposed in the sample, the utilization rate of light is greatly improved. In summary, THS showed excellent performance in photocatalytic removal of nitrogen oxides (NO).

Conclusions
Raspberry-like TiO2 hollow spheres prepared using optimized conditions (sample THS-1) exhibited excellent photocatalytic performance in the removal of nitrogen oxides. 60% of NO was removed, and 57% was still removed after twelve cycles of stability testing, and the selectivity to NO2 was only 12.3%. The characterization showed that the efficient NO removal ability came from the special morphology of THS-1. These raspberry-like hollow spheres assembled by TiO2 nanocrystals greatly reduce the agglomeration degree, and the specific surface area and pore volume of the sample are about three times those of P25, which makes the adsorption of contaminated gas on the sample surface easier. When light irradiates THS-1, it not only acts on the outer surface, but also refracts in the cavities. The ultra-thin hollow spherical shell makes the cavities also have high activity. A large number of (001) high-energy crystal planes exist on the surface of the sample to further promote the photocatalytic activity. This hollow spherical structure composed of nanocrystals provides an effective strategy for photocatalytic removal of gas pollutants.

Environmental significance
Large amounts of nitrogen oxides are produced in thermal power, industrial and transportation processes. Reducing emissions of nitrogen oxides is conducive to alleviating regional warming and improving air quality. Therefore, a clean and efficient method is urgently needed to remove nitrogen oxides. Photocatalytic oxidation as an efficient approach can remove nitrogen oxides. The photocatalytic activity of samples can be improved by changing the morphology of a TiO2 photocatalyst. By assembling TiO2 nanocrystals into raspberry-like hollow spheres, the contact area between nitrogen oxides and photocatalyst is increased, and light can be refracted in the hollow sphere cavities to improve the utilization rate of light. The raspberry-like TiO2 hollow spheres showed excellent photocatalytic oxidation performance for nitrogen oxides removal. The hollow spheres revealed excellent photocatalytic oxidation of NO compared with a commercial TiO2 catalyst (P25). The result is of much importance for the environment.
