    , Accepted 29th August 2017First published on 30th August 2017AbstractUnfavorable interfacial electron back-injection, sluggish surface kinetics, and poor bulk conductivity leading to remarkable recombination are the key issues which significantly hinder the solar-to-hydrogen efficiency of PEC photoanodes. In this study, Ti foil is employed as the substrate for fabricating BiVO4 photoanodes. Surface passivation of TiO2 is sophisticatedly designed to block interface recombination in solar water splitting for the first time, so that a significant two-fold increase in photocurrent and a large decrease in dark current are observed. In addition, to address the other two issues, CoOx oxygen evolution catalysts (OECs) and Mo/N doping are applied to increase the photocurrent density and applied bias photon-to-current efficiency to 5.04 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE and 1.41% at 0.75 VRHE, respectively, under AM 1.5 G illumination, which suggests the great potential of integrating strategies to target specific issues in BiVO4 photoanodes.
Introduction
Sustainable energy developments have been on the agenda for decades to tackle the energy crisis. As a quintessential method of solar hydrogen production, photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting is one of the most promising strategies for direct chemical energy conversion and storage by utilizing solar energy.1–4 Recently, bismuth vanadate (BiVO4), an n-type semiconductor, has emerged as a highly sought-after photoanode material used in PEC due to its favorable band structure, earth abundance, chemical stability and substantial absorption of visible light (band energy, ∼2.5 eV).5–7 The maximum theoretical water oxidation photocurrent density (Jmax) of the BiVO4 photoanode is 7.5 mA cm−2, but the practical implementation is still far below the theoretical value.8 This can be ascribed to some factors including poor carrier mobility and strong recombination occurring in the interface, bulk and surface.9,10
At present, hard conductive substrates like F-doped or In-doped SnO2 (FTO or ITO) coated glass are commonly employed to load the mesoporous BiVO4 photoanode material in PEC applications.10–18 However, for these substrates there will be some exposed areas after the mesoporous photoanode is grown. Moreover, the electron back-injection and back reduction of photo-oxidized products occurring in these exposed areas have been considered as non-negligible efficiency loss.9,19–21 Hence, solution-mediated recombination losses because of electron back-injection and back reduction can be considered explicitly as important energy loss for BiVO4 photoanodes in a PEC system using FTO or ITO glass substrates (schematically illustrated in Fig. 1a). Nevertheless, poor majority carrier density and surface oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics, and photoelectron-hole recombination in the bulk and the surface are other important obstacles for BiVO4 photoanodes in PEC water splitting.22–24 As a result, in view of the disadvantages mentioned above, it remains a highly desirable yet challenging goal to reduce these recombination losses simultaneously. Some semiconductor thin films such as TiO2, SnO2 and NbOx were deposited as an underlayer or overlayer to block electron back-injection in the exposed regions of the FTO substrate.19,25 However, the additional deposition process will make photoanode preparation complex and the poor contact between the underlayer and substrate will block electrons extracted from the photoanode materials to the external circuit for efficient hydrogen production.

Herein, for the first time we used Ti foil as the substrate for BiVO4 photoanode fabrication in consideration of its lightweight, flexibility and high conductivity. We discovered that a robust and compact TiO2 thin layer was formed on the exposed Ti substrate after the conventional annealing process in BiVO4 photoanode preparation. When utilizing Ti foil as the substrate, this in situ growth of TiO2 on the exposed substrate could effectively block electron back-injection (schematically illustrated in Fig. 1b). In addition, we introduced Mo doping and N2 incorporation7 processes to improve the carrier mobility of BiVO4. Finally, an efficient CoOx OER catalyst was deposited onto the BiVO4 photoanode to improve its surface OER kinetics. Accordingly, these modified approaches would guarantee a concurrent enhancement in charge extraction, carrier mobility and surface charge transport for BiVO4 photoanodes in PEC applications. As a result, the photocurrent density and applied bias photon-to-current efficiency (ABPE) of modified BiVO4 photoanodes based on the Ti substrate reached 5.04 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE and 1.41% at 0.75 VRHE, respectively.
Experimental section
Preparation of FTO-BiVO4 and Ti foil-BiVO4 photoanodes
Pristine BiVO4 photoanodes were synthesized on a clean F-doped SnO2 coated glass (FTO, area of ∼2.0 cm2, OPV Tech Co., Ltd) and a polished commercial Ti substrate (area of ∼2.0 cm2) respectively by the modified electrodeposition method developed by Kim and Choi.11 Typically, the BiOI precursor for the BiVO4 photoanodes was electrodeposited on the FTO or Ti substrate in a conventional three-electrode glass cell with an Ag/AgCl electrode serving as the reference electrode and a Pt electrode serving as the counter electrode. The BiOI deposition solution was prepared by mixing 50 mL of solution containing 0.04 M Bi(NO3)3 (99.0%, Guangzhou Chemical Reagent) and 0.4 M KI (99.0%, Guangzhou Chemical Reagent) with pH adjusted to 1.7 by adding concentrated HNO3 (65–68%, AR, Guangzhou Chemical Reagent), with 20 mL 0.23 M p-benzoquinone (97%, Aladdin) in absolute ethanol. After being vigorously stirred for a few minutes, the resulting solution was used for cathodic deposition being conducted potentiostatically at −0.3 V vs. Ag/AgCl for 90 s (the SEM images of the resulting BiOI electrodes are shown in Fig. S1†). The conversion of BiOI to BiVO4 was performed by drop casting 0.1 mL dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (AR, Tianjin Damao Reagent) solution containing 0.2 M vanadyl acetylacetonate (VO(acac)2) (95%, Aladdin) onto the as-prepared BiOI electrodes, and then annealed in a muffle furnace for 2 h at 450 °C (ramp rate of 2 °C min−1). Finally the as-annealed electrodes were soaked in a 1 M NaOH (AR, Guangzhou Chemical Reagent) solution for 30 min under gentle stirring to remove excess V2O5 on the electrodes. The resulting pristine BiVO4 electrodes were rinsed with deionized water and dried in air.
Preparation of Mo–BiVO4, N–BiVO4 and Mo, N–BiVO4 photoanodes
The as-prepared Ti foil-BiVO4 electrodes were first immersed in a DMSO solution containing a certain amount of molybdenyl acetylacetonate (99%, Aladdin) for 60 s. Excess molybdenum source solution was removed by a quick contact of the electrodes with a filter paper. For the concentration-dependent experiment, the concentration of the molybdenum source was controlled to be 10, 25, 50 and 75 mM. The electrodes were then annealed in a muffle furnace at 350 °C for 2 h with a ramp rate of 5 °C min−1, and the resulting electrodes were denoted as Mo–BiVO4. The best concentration of the molybdenum source was proved to be 50 mM, which achieved a photocurrent density of 2.37 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE (Fig. S2†). For the preparation of N–BiVO4 electrodes, the as-prepared Ti foil-BiVO4 electrodes were post-annealed in a tube furnace under N2 flow at 350 °C for 2 h with a ramp rate of 5 °C min−1, which was reported in previous study.7 For the preparation of Mo, N–BiVO4 electrodes, the as-prepared Ti foil-BiVO4 electrodes were synthesized through combining Mo-doping treatment and annealing process under a N2 atmosphere mentioned above.
Photo-assisted deposition of CoOx catalysts
The deposition of CoOx oxygen evolution reaction catalysts on the surface of the co-doped-BiVO4 photoanodes was conducted by using a spin-coating method and post-illumination treatment. Specifically, a 50 mM CoCl2 (99%, Aladdin) solution was spin-coated onto the as-prepared Mo, N–BiVO4 electrodes in two stages, 500 rpm for 6 s and 3000 rpm for 30 s and the above steps were repeated three times. After the spin-coating process, the electrodes were illuminated for 10 min under AM 1.5 one sun irradiation. The resulting electrodes were then washed with deionized water and dried in air.
Characterization
The as-prepared samples were characterized using an X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Rigaku MiniFlex 600), a field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, ZEISS ULTRA 55), a transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEOL 2100F, 200 kV), and an X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS, ESCALab250). The absorption spectra of the samples were measured with a UV-visible spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-3600). The photoluminescence (PL) spectra were recorded on a fluorescence spectrophotometer (Shimadzu RF-5301PC).
Photoelectrochemical measurements
The PEC and electrochemical measurements of photoanodes synthesized in this work were conducted in a typical three-electrode configuration using an Ag/AgCl reference electrode and a Pt counter electrode. A 0.1 M phosphate buffer solution (pH 7.4) was used as the electrolyte and additional 1 M sodium sulfite (Na2SO3) (99.0%, Guangzhou Chemical Reagent) was added to it as a hole scavenger for water and sulfite oxidation measurements. The simulated solar illumination source was a 150 W Xe arc lamp (Newport, 6255) coupled with an AM 1.5 G filter (Newport, 81094). A radiometer was used to calibrate the power density of the incident light to be 100 mW cm−2. IPCE spectra were collected on an electrochemical workstation (Princeton Applied Research) and a QE-R system (Enlitech). Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) was conducted on an electrochemical workstation (Princeton Applied Research) at an applied bias of 1.23 VRHE with an AC amplitude of 10 mV and in a frequency range between 100 kHz and 0.1 Hz. All other electrochemical measurements were conducted on a CHI 660D electrochemical workstation (CHI, Shanghai).
Calculations
The recorded potential versus Ag/AgCl (EAg/AgCl) in this work was converted against a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) using the Nernst equation eqn (1) given below: ERHE = EAg/AgCl + 0.059pH + 0.1976 V(1)
IPCE was calculated using eqn (2) given below: (2)here I is the photocurrent density, λ is the incident monochromatic light wavelength and Jlight is the measured irradiance.
The recorded water oxidation photocurrent density (JH2O) in the PEC performance measurements can be formulated as eqn (3): JH2O = Jmax × ηabs × ηsep × ηtrans(3)here Jmax is the maximum photocurrent density given that the IPCE for photons with energy ≥ Eg is 100%, ηabs is the light absorption efficiency, ηsep is the charge separation efficiency and ηtrans is the surface transfer efficiency.
In view of sulfite oxidation with extremely fast oxidation kinetics, the ηtrans can be taken as ∼1. Hence, the sulfite oxidation photocurrent density (Jsul) in the presence of Na2SO3 is expressed as eqn (4): Jsul = Jmax × ηabs × ηsep(4)
Therefore, ηsep and ηtrans can be obtained through the two formulae mentioned below: (5) (6)
The applied bias photon-to-current efficiency (ABPE) is calculated by the following eqn (7): (7)here Jph is the photocurrent density at the measured potential, Vb is the applied bias versus the RHE, and Ptotal is the power density of incident irradiation (100 mW cm−2).
Results and discussion

Fig. 2a depicts the cross-sectional SEM image of the Ti foil-BiVO4 photoanode, unveiling the mesoporous morphology of BiVO4 (ref. 11) and the compact TiO2 layer under the homogeneous BiVO4 layer. Fig. 2b compares the photocurrent density–potential (J–V) curves of the FTO-BiVO4 and Ti foil-BiVO4 samples in 0.1 M phosphate buffer solution without a hole scavenger (pH 7.4). Obviously, the Ti foil-BiVO4 photoanode shows a significant 2-fold improved photocurrent density (0.81 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE) compared with the FTO-BiVO4 photoanode (0.34 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE). This improvement could be ascribed to the blocking effect of compact TiO2 and the high conductivity of the Ti foil metal substrate. The additional compact TiO2 layer also induces a slight cathodic shift of the photocurrent onset potential, as illustrated in Fig. 2c (the enlarged view of Fig. 2b near 0.2 VRHE). This cathodic shift result is consistent with previous studies.19,25 Moreover, the blocking effect of the compact TiO2 layer is also manifested by the lower dark current density and the anodic shift of the dark current onset potential (shown in Fig. 2d). In other words, reaction sites for solution-mediated recombination are blocked by the compact TiO2 layer, resulting in a decreased leakage (dark) current, which accordingly induces an anodic shift of the onset potential in the dark.25 In comparison with previous studies, our Ti substrate can effectively block electron back-injection by introducing the in situ growth of TiO2 and guarantee excellent ohmic contact for the BiVO4 layer as well. These results prove that we have successfully developed a strategy to design BiVO4 based photoanodes by using the Ti substrate. Meanwhile, the Ti foil-BiVO4 photoanode has significant advantages compared with the conventional FTO-BiVO4 photoanode.

Though the PEC performance of BiVO4 can be enhanced by introducing a compact TiO2 layer with Ti foil as the conductive substrate, the photocurrent density is still far below the theoretical value.8 In order to improve the conductivity of BiVO4, molybdenum (Mo) doping was a common and effective strategy.22,26 Recently, nitrogen (N2) incorporation into BiVO4 was found to be effective in increasing the majority carrier density and mobility of BiVO4 photoanodes.7 In this work, these two strategies were innovatively integrated into our sample fabrication. In other words, N2 flow was introduced during the Mo doping process, resulting in molybdenum and nitrogen doping and generation of oxygen vacancies.

Fig. 3 shows SEM images at high and low magnifications of the pristine BiVO4 (a and b), Mo–BiVO4 (c and d), N–BiVO4 (e and f) and Mo, N–BiVO4 (g and h) photoanodes based on the Ti substrate. Obviously, the same mesoporous morphology of all photoanodes indicates that the doping process has little effect on our BiVO4 material based on the Ti substrate. Fig. 4a shows the XRD patterns of BiOI, BiVO4 and co-doped BiVO4 (Mo, N–BiVO4) samples based on the Ti substrate. Besides the Ti peaks originated from the Ti substrate, all other diffraction peaks corresponded well to monoclinic BiVO4 (JCPDS 14-0688) and BiOI (JCPDS 10-0445). The co-doped sample shows nearly the same peaks as the pristine BiVO4, which can be ascribed to the low concentration of doping ions.7Fig. 4b depicts typical scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and STEM elemental mapping images of co-doped BiVO4, showing the well crystallized form of BiVO4 and the lattice fringe of 0.29 nm corresponding to the (040) plane of BiVO4. Moreover, the mapping images reveal the incorporation of Mo ions into BiVO4 samples. There is no obvious signal of the N element which can be ascribed to the very low incorporation of N ions in BiVO4 and this result is in accordance with the previous study.7 The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) survey spectra of pristine BiVO4 and co-doped BiVO4 are shown in Fig. 4c and d and S4.† Obviously, for the Mo, N–BiVO4 sample, the Bi 4f and V 2p peaks shift to lower binding energy, which should be due to the partial reduction of Bi3+ and V5+ ions resulted from the incorporation of Mo and N ions into BiVO4.7 In addition, Mo 3d and N 1s peaks are found in the spectra of the co-doped sample (Fig. S3†), which also confirm the incorporation of Mo and N ions in the BiVO4 lattice. In general, our innovative integrated fabrication successfully introduced Mo and N ions into BiVO4 as expected.

Fig. 5a shows the J–V curves of pristine and modified BiVO4 photoanodes based on the Ti substrate in 0.1 M phosphate buffer solution (pH 7.4). The pristine BiVO4 shows a relatively low photocurrent density of 0.81 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE, due to its low charge carrier density and poor surface OER kinetics. There are some reports about single doped photoanodes like Mo–BiVO4 and N–BiVO4 which achieved higher photocurrent density on the FTO substrate because doped Mo or N ions can improve the charge carrier density of BiVO4 and give enhanced bulk kinetics.7,22,26 We also got similar results on the Ti substrate. The Mo–BiVO4 and N–BiVO4 on Ti foil also reached higher current densities (2.37 mA cm−2 and 1.91 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE, respectively) compared with non-doped BiVO4 photoanodes. To further improve the charge carrier density, we designed a co-doped photoanode (marked as Mo, N–BiVO4). As expected it reaches the highest photocurrent density of 3.41 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE, which is about a 4-fold increase compared with the pristine BiVO4 photoanode. And this result is also better than previous reports. For example, the Co-Pi/W:BiVO4 photoanode reported by Zhong et al. achieves about 1.4 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE (ref. 9) and the Mo–BiVO4 photoanode prepared by Gong et al. achieves about 1.2 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE.15
 Fig. 5  (a) J–V curves for solar water oxidation of pristine and modified BiVO4 photoanodes based on the Ti substrate (collected in 0.1 M phosphate buffer solution without a hole scavenger (pH 7.4) under AM 1.5 G illumination, front-side illumination, scan rate, 10 mV s−1). (b) IPCE spectra collected at 1.23 VRHE. 
The IPCE results recorded at 1.23 VRHE (Fig. 5b) reveal that all photoanodes exhibit similar curves, and the photocurrent response of the Mo, N–BiVO4 photoanode is much higher than that of pristine and single doping BiVO4 photoanodes, which is in accordance with their J–V characteristics. As shown in Fig. S5,† the UV-vis absorption spectra of pristine and modified BiVO4 photoanodes demonstrate that all the photoanodes feature similar absorption edges in accordance with the band energy of BiVO4 (∼2.5 eV).5 Nevertheless, the photo active range of IPCE spectra is identical to that of UV-vis absorption spectra, indicating that the bulk engineering has no significant effect on the light absorption of the samples.
The electron–hole separation efficiency (ηsep) is an important factor to evaluate the recombination occurring in photoanodes. As shown in Fig. 6a, the ηsep values of Mo–BiVO4 and N–BiVO4 photoanodes (63.7% and 66.3% at 1.23 VRHE, respectively) are higher than that of the pristine BiVO4 photoanode (56.7% at 1.23 VRHE), meaning that Mo or N ion incorporation can efficiently enhance the charge separation efficiency. This result accords with previous reports about Mo or N doped BiVO4.7,22 Moreover, the Mo, N–BiVO4 photoanode we designed displays the highest value of ηsep (73.4% at 1.23 VRHE) as anticipated. And the photoanodes on the Ti substrate also showed a higher ηsep value compared with the same photoanodes on the FTO substrate (as shown in Fig. S6†). These results fully support the hypothesis that our integrated bulk engineering can effectively improve the bulk kinetics of BiVO4 by enhancing the charge separation efficiency. Moreover, this point is also proved by the photoluminescence (PL) emission spectra. As shown in Fig. S7,† strong emission intensity from pristine BiVO4 is observed, indicating the serious recombination in the bulk of pristine BiVO4. In contrast, doped samples show weak emission intensity especially the co-doped photoanode, verifying that the recombination process is remarkably suppressed in our modified photoanodes. This result is in good agreement with the ηsep in Fig. 6a. Furthermore, with the presence of Na2SO3 as a hole scavenger in the electrolyte, the oxidation kinetics of sulfite for the photoanodes are investigated. Fig. S8† demonstrates the J–V curves of pristine and modified BiVO4 photoanodes for solar sulfite oxidation. It can be assumed that the surface electron/hole recombination is negligible and the surface transfer efficiency (ηtrans) is about 100%, due to the very fast rate of surface charge transfer of photoanodes during the sulfite oxidation process. Hence, the values of ηtrans are calculated by ηtrans = JH2O/Jsul (detailed calculation is shown in the Experimental section), as shown in Fig. 6b. The co-doped photoanode displays the highest value (68.5% at 1.23 VRHE) in comparison with that of other photoanodes (23.3% for BiVO4, 60.0% for Mo–BiVO4 and 49.3% for N–BiVO4). These results imply that the bulk doping modifications can also partly play a role in the promotional effect of charge transfer by improving the conductivity and electron–hole separation efficiency of BiVO4 photoanodes.7
 Fig. 6  Charge separation efficiency (ηsep) (a) and charge transfer efficiency (ηtrans) (b) calculated from J–V curves. Mott–Schottky plots (c) measured at 1 kHz frequency in the dark and electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) (d) measured at 1.23 VRHE under AM 1.5 G illumination. All these results are collected in 0.1 M phosphate buffer solution without a hole scavenger (pH 7.4). 
Mott–Schottky (M–S) measurements are conducted to further investigate the charge carrier density of the photoanodes. As depicted in Fig. 6c, positive slopes of the curves confirm that all of the samples are n-type semiconductors. Generally, a smaller slope of the M–S curve means a larger charge carrier concentration in photoanodes.27 Obviously, the slope of the M–S curve recorded from the co-doped photoanode is the smallest among the measured photoanodes, and the single doping photoanodes also display smaller slopes than that of the pristine BiVO4 photoanode. The above results reveal that the incorporation of Mo and N ions in BiVO4 can significantly increase the charge carrier concentration, which is in good agreement with the results of ηsep in Fig. 6a. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis is employed to understand the charge transport of photoanodes. Fig. 6d demonstrates the Nyquist plots of different photoanodes, showing various radii of similar semicircles (fitting results are shown in Table S1†). Typically, the radius is related to the charge transfer resistance at the interface of the photoanode/electrolyte.27 The Mo, N–BiVO4 displays the minimum value of 0.38 kΩ for the charge transfer resistance in comparison with those of other photoanodes (40.90 kΩ for BiVO4, 15.22 kΩ for Mo–BiVO4 and 18.78 kΩ for N–BiVO4). The decreased resistances indicate that the modified strategies can effectively improve the charge transfer of BiVO4 photoanodes, which is consistent with the results of M–S plots and ηtrans. In a word, the above comparison results suggest that our integrated bulk engineering is an effective strategy to improve the charge carrier density, photoelectron-hole separation and charge transport of BiVO4 photoanodes.
However, as shown in Fig. 5a, the Mo, N–BiVO4 still suffers from poor surface OER kinetics which results in a low current density. To improve the surface OER kinetics of BiVO4 photoanodes, the CoOx catalyst is introduced by simple spin-coating and post-irradiation processes.28 The morphology of CoOx coated Mo, N–BiVO4 is shown in Fig. S9a and b.†Fig. 7a compares the J–V curves of pristine BiVO4, Mo, N–BiVO4 and CoOx coated Mo, N–BiVO4 (CoOx–Mo, N–BiVO4) photoanodes. Obviously, the CoOx–Mo, N–BiVO4 photoanode shows a comparatively high photocurrent density of 5.04 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE, which compares favourably with the best values reported previously for BiVO4 photoanodes in solar water oxidation implementations such as FeOOH–NiOOH/N–BiVO4 (∼5 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE),7 NiFeOx–Bi–BiVO4 (∼5 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE)10 and NiOOH/FeOOH/CQDs/BiVO4 (5.99 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE)29 (summary results are shown in Table S2†). Accordingly, the ηsep and ηtrans increase to 93.6% and 93.7% at 1.23 VRHE (Fig. 7b and c), respectively, which are also much higher than those of pristine BiVO4. These results indicate that the deposition of CoOx can efficiently improve the surface OER kinetics and further suppress the surface recombination of BiVO4 photoanodes as expected. Fig. 7d depicts the ABPE of the pristine and modified BiVO4 photoanodes. In accordance with the results of J–V curves, the CoOx–Mo, N–BiVO4 shows the highest efficiency of 1.41% at about 0.75 VRHE compared to 0.59% for Mo, N–BiVO4 and 0.15% for BiVO4. The ABPE results are also comparable with those of other BiVO4 photoanodes reported previously such as BiVO4/FeOOH/NiOOH (1.75% ABPE)11 and NiO/CoOx/BiVO4 (1.5% ABPE).16 Moreover, the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) was calculated from the double-layer capacitance (Cdl) of the electrode surface and the LSV curve of solar water oxidation was standardized by the ECSA (Fig. S17–S19†).30 As shown in Fig. S19,† the improved tendency of the photocurrent densities standardized by ECSA is unchanged, exhibiting improved inherent properties of BiVO4 photoanodes by our synthetic strategy. The above results reveal that our modified approaches can effectively boost the PEC performance of BiVO4 photoanodes by suppressing recombination, improving conductivity and OER kinetics simultaneously. The long-term stability of the CoOx–Mo, N–BiVO4 photoanode for water oxidation is examined by measuring J–t plots at 0.6 VRHE. As shown in Fig. S13,† the photocurrent for water oxidation is stable for at least 2 hours. This result proves the long term stability of the photoanode we designed.

Conclusions
In summary, the in situ growth of a compact TiO2 layer is introduced by using Ti foil as the substrate for BiVO4 photoanode fabrication to suppress the interface recombination. To further improve its charge carrier density and surface OER kinetics, the simultaneous co-doping approach (Mo and N) and deposition of the CoOx catalyst are employed, respectively. As a result, the CoOx coated co-doped BiVO4 photoanode on the Ti substrate achieves a photocurrent density of 5.04 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE and an ABPE of 1.41% at 0.75 VRHE for solar water oxidation, which are comparable to other outstanding studies reported previously. The synergistic effect, realized by interface (blocking electron-injection), bulk (enhancing charge separation) and surface (improving charge transfer) engineering guarantees prominent PEC response properties of BiVO4 photoanodes. We believe that our innovatively integrated engineering offers a new perspective for achieving more efficient artificial PEC water splitting photoanodes.
