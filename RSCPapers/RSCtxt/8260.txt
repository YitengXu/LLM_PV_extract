    , Accepted 27th December 2018First published on 2nd January 2019AbstractThe production of gas-phase hydroperoxyl radicals, HO2, is observed directly from sub-micron airborne TiO2 nanoparticles irradiated by 300–400 nm radiation. The rate of HO2 production as a function of O2 pressure follows Langmuir isotherm behaviour suggesting O2 is involved in the production of HO2 following its adsorption onto the surface of the TiO2 aerosol. Reduction of adsorbed O2 by photogenerated electrons is likely to be the initial step followed by reaction with a proton produced via oxidation of adsorbed water with a photogenerated hole. The rate of HO2 production decreased significantly over the range of relative humidities between 8.7 and 36.9%, suggesting competitive adsorption of water vapour inhibits HO2 production. From the data, the adsorption equilibrium constants were calculated to be: KO2 = 0.27 ± 0.02 Pa−1 and KH2O = 2.16 ± 0.12 Pa−1 for RH = 8.7%, decreasing to KO2 = 0.18 ± 0.01 Pa−1 and KH2O = 1.33 ± 0.04 Pa−1 at RH = 22.1%. The increased coverage of H2O onto the TiO2 aerosol surface may inhibit HO2 production by decreasing the effective surface area of the TiO2 particle and lowering the binding energy of O2 on the aerosol surface, hence shortening its desorption lifetime. The maximum yield (i.e. when [O2] is projected to atmospherically relevant levels) for production of gas-phase HO2, normalised for surface area and light intensity, was found to be  at a RH of 8.7% for the 80% anatase and 20% rutile formulation of TiO2 used here. This yield decreased to  as the RH was increased to 22.1%. Using this value, the rate of production of HO2 from TiO2 surfaces under atmospheric conditions was estimated to be in the range 5 × 104–1 × 106 molecule cm−3 s−1 using observed surface areas of mineral dust at Cape Verde, and assuming a TiO2 fraction of 4.5%. For the largest loadings of dust in the troposphere, the rate of this novel heterogeneous production mechanism begins to approach that of HO2 production from the gas-phase reaction of OH with CO in unpolluted regions. The production of gas-phase OH radicals could only be observed conclusively at high aerosol surface areas, and was attributed to the decomposition of H2O2 at the surface by photogenerated electrons.
1. Introduction
The photocatalytic properties of TiO2 are widely known1,2 and have been exploited in many applications such as water and air purification and self-cleaning materials.3 TiO2 is a semiconductor material and when illuminated with UV light an electron (e−) is promoted from its valance band into its conduction band also creating a hole (h+) (R1). The magnitude of the band gap for TiO2 nanoparticles is ∼3.2 eV, so there is a wavelength threshold of λ < 388 nm for TiO2 to become electronically conductive.4 The e− and h+ pair can migrate to the crystal surface and subsequently oxidise and reduce adsorbed donor and acceptor molecules, respectively.5 One reaction of interest is the oxidation of water by h+ to produce highly reactive hydroxyl radicals (OH, (R2)) on the TiO2 surface.6 Other reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as the hydroperoxyl radical (HO2), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and singlet oxygen (O2(1Δ), (R3)–(R10)), can also be formed on the surface of TiO2 materials. The detailed reaction mechanism for the formation of these ROS on the surface of TiO2 is not well understood, however it is believed to be as follows:6 TiO2 + hν (λ < 388 nm) → TiO2 + h+ + e−(R1) h+ + H2O → OH + H+(R2) O2 + H+ + e− → HO2(R3) 2OH → H2O2(R4) HO2 + e− + H+ → H2O2(R5) 2HO2 → H2O2 + O2(R6) O2 + e− → O2−(R7) O2− + h+ → O2(1Δ)(R8) H2O2 + O2− → OH + OH− + O2(R9) OH + HO2 → H2O2 + ½O2(R10)ROS formed on the surface of the TiO2 catalyst can react with and degrade adsorbed organic compounds making it ideal for air and water purification applications. However, some laboratory studies have shown that some ROS can also desorb from the surface of TiO2 materials into the gas phase. Lee and Choi7 observed the degradation of soot particles that came within close proximity, but not into direct contact, with an illuminated substrate partially covered with TiO2. Tatsuma et al.8 saw the degradation of organic films placed adjacent (up to 2.2 mm) from a TiO2 film in the presence of light and air. Both experiments indicate possible OH emissions from the surface. Murakami et al.9 conducted the first study that directly observed gas phase OH radicals using low pressure laser induced florescence up to 8 mm from illuminated TiO2 powders. They demonstrated that OH was produced from photocatalytic activity on the surface of the TiO2 powder through studies using deuterated water vapour, and observed a decrease in OH signal as calcination temperatures of TiO2 powders were increased. Vincent et al.10 and Thiebaud et al.11 demonstrated experimentally the formation of OH radicals and H2O2 molecules in the gas phase upon irradiation of TiO2 surface in the presence of H2O. HO2 emissions from irradiated TiO2 surfaces in the presence of gas phase H2O2 at low pressures (50 and 200 Torr) were first observed by Bahrini et al.6 In that study HO2 was detected up to 44 mm away from the TiO2 surface using Cavity Ring Down Spectroscopy (cw-CDRS) which directly observed the decomposition of H2O2 and production of HO2 simultaneously. Bahrini et al.6 showed that significant concentrations of H2O2 (1.2 × 1014 molecule cm−3) decomposed over 140 s until a steady state concentration was reached. In one example, it was demonstrated that 6.9 × 1011 molecule cm−3 of HO2 was generated in this way. It was concluded that gas phase HO2 was produced via the decomposition of H2O2 by irradiated TiO2, however the mechanism for the formation of HO2 was unclear. This study was taken further by Yi et al.4 who showed that gas phase HO2 was only produced if H2O2 was also present within their system and that using either N2 or O2 as carrier gas made little difference in gas phase HO2 concentrations. This suggests that HO2 was created via H2O2 decomposition and not from photocatalytic reduction of O2 and that H2O2 serves as the electron acceptor as well as an electron donor ((R11) and (R12)). Yi et al. also showed that different polymorphs of TiO2, such as anatase and rutile, perform very differently with some showing rapid degradation of H2O2 but little HO2 emissions and others with slower degradation but with higher emissions of HO2. Through studies with e− and h+ scavengers it was shown that H2O2 decomposition is initiated by reaction with e−(R11) or h+(R12) or OH (R13), produced via(R2). H2O2 + e− → OH + OH−(R11) H2O2 + h+ → HO2 + H+(R12) H2O2 + OH → HO2 + H2O(R13)This study reports the first direct observation of HO2 and OH emissions when airborne TiO2 nanoparticles are irradiated with UVA light (320 to 400 nm) in the presence of water vapour and oxygen alone (i.e. with no added H2O2) within an aerosol flow tube equipped with a highly sensitive laser induced fluorescence (LIF) detector for OH and HO2 (limit of detection ∼1 × 106 molecule cm−3).

A detailed description of the apparatus, which has been used in a slightly different configuration for uptake studies of HO2 onto a variety of sub-micron aerosols, is provided elsewhere.12 In summary, a humidified flow of TiO2 aerosols was introduced within a laminar aerosol flow tube reactor made from borosilicate glass (107 cm length, 5.9 cm I.D.) held at atmospheric pressure. The TiO2 aerosols were irradiated with a UV lamp (see Section 2.2) placed 5 cm above the aerosol flow tube. The HO2 signal was then measured at the end of the aerosol flow tube using a laser-induced fluorescence at low pressure, a technique known as Fluorescence Assay by Gas Expansion (FAGE, see Section 2.4), after chemical conversion by its reaction with NO to OH.13 The size distribution of TiO2 aerosols within the aerosol flow tube was measured using a Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer (SMPS, see Section 2.3) from a flow sampled from the exhaust of the aerosol flow tube. All gas flows within the experiment were controlled using mass flow controllers (Brookes and MKS). The RH and temperature of the flow was measured using a calibrated probe (Rotronics Hygroclip 2, accuracy ±0.8% RH and ±0.1 K) in the exhaust of the aerosol flow tube.
2.2. Aerosol irradiation
The aerosol flow tube was illuminated with a UV lamp located adjacent to the FAGE cell and approximately 5 cm above the aerosol flow tube. Two UV lamps were used in this study; a 15 W UVA bench lamp (which has two 420 mm length fluorescent tubes, UVP, XX-15) and an 8 W UVA lamp (1 × 8 W 300 mm length fluorescent tube, Eterna, LFT58WH). The 15 W UVA lamp was used in all studies unless otherwise stated. The absolute lamp fluxes of the lamps as a function of wavelength were measured using a calibrated spectral radiometer (Ocean Optics QE500) as is shown in Fig. 2. These fluxes were measured outside the aerosol flow tube since it was not possible to fit the integrating dome of the spectral radiometer within the aerosol flow tube due to space constraints. Both the aerosol flow tube and the halocarbon wax film, which was applied to the walls of the aerosol flow tube to reduce HO2 wall losses, attenuates light entering the aerosol flow tube. An experiment was conducted where the spectral output of the 8 W lamp whilst it was placed inside the aerosol flow tube was measured with the integrating dome of the spectral radiometer placed outside the aerosol flow tube and positioned where the UV lamps are usually placed (with the same distance from lamp to integrating dome). This experiment showed that the total flux of UVA photons from the 8 W lamp (integrated between 250 and 388 nm) placed inside the aerosol flow tube was 16 times lower than when the flux was measured with the lamp outside the aerosol flow tube (as shown in Fig. 2) for the same lamp to integrating dome distance. Hence, the light flux inside of the aerosol flow tube with the lamp placed outside is assumed to be 16 times smaller than shown in Fig. 2, although it is realised there are considerable uncertainties, for example the circular nature of the flow-tube may create a heterogeneous light field within the aerosol flow tube, and there is an opposite lensing effect for the two cases. The attenuation factor from the tube/wax was found to be approximately constant with wavelength across the spectral output of the 8 W lamp, and hence it was assumed for the 15 W lamp (which would not fit within the flow tube) that the flux inside the flow tube would scale in a similar manner and be 16 times lower than shown in Fig. 2.
 Fig. 2  UVA emission spectra for the 8 W UVA lamp measured inside (green line) and measured outside (black line) the aerosol flow tube and for the 15 W UVA lamp calculated inside (purple line) and measured outside (red line) the aerosol flow tube, in all cases with the spectral radiometer integrating dome outside the flow tube. In all cases the distance from the lamp to the spectral radiometer integrating dome was constant. The actinic flux (blue line) measured at the Weybourne Atmospheric Observatory (Norfolk Coast, UK, 52°57′N, 1°07′E) on the 1st July 2015 is shown for comparison. 

Fig. 2 also compares the spectral variation of the flux of the lamps to a typical actinic flux spectrum measured at a mid-latitude coastal site in the UK in summer. The amount of light with λ < 388 nm (threshold for promotion of electron to the TiO2 conduction band) from the 8 W lamp entering the flow tube was ∼7 times smaller than that from typical actinic fluxes experienced within the troposphere and ∼5 times smaller than fluxes from the 15 W lamp. The amount of such light emitted from the 15 W lamp entering the flow tube was comparable to typical actinic fluxes, which are 40% greater. There are also notable differences in the emission spectra of the two lamps. The average wavelength emitted from the 15 W lamp (340 nm) is smaller than the 8 W lamp (365 nm) and the 15 W lamp emits a broader range of wavelengths in the ultraviolet region (275–400 nm) compared to the 8 W lamp (325–400 nm).
2.3. Aerosol generation and detection
A suspension of TiO2 nanoparticles (Aldrich Chemistry 718467, 99.5% Degussa, 5 g in 500 mL of Milli-Q water) was placed in a commercial atomizer (TSI 3076) which was in turn connected to compressed nitrogen which produced a 3.5 L min−1 flow entrained with TiO2 particles, of which 1.5 L min−1 was introduced into the apparatus (referred to as the aerosol flow) and the rest left the apparatus through an exhaust. The nanoparticles are composed of 80% anatase and 20% rutile, polymorphs of TiO2. Similar formulations of TiO2, such as Degussa P25 (75% anatase and 25% rutile), are widely used in laboratory studies,2 and have been shown to have enhanced photocatalytic activity as electrons can rapidly transfer from the rutile to anatase crystallites which results in photoactivity occurring at visible wavelengths and creates enhanced catalytic activity at the rutile–anatase interface.14 The aerosol flow was then passed through a neutraliser to reduce static wall losses, a diffusion drier and an impactor (TSI 1034900) to ensure larger aerosols beyond the detection range of the SMPS (∼750 nm) do not enter the aerosol flow tube. A high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA, PALL Life Sciences) filter situated within a by-pass loop was used to control the number concentration of particles entering the aerosol flow tube. The aerosol flow was then mixed with a humidified flow of nitrogen to control the RH within the system. The RH of the humidified flow was altered by changing the ratio of dry nitrogen and nitrogen passed through a water bubbler. Oxygen was introduced into the system via zero air (BOC UN1002, 20% O2 and 80% N2) before the aerosol and humidified flow enters the conditioning tube and controlled using a calibrated mass flow controller (Alicat Scientific). This flow was then passed through a conditioning tube (residence time ∼5 s) before entering the aerosol flow tube to allow time for adequate mixing of the three flows and water vapour adsorption onto the surface of the TiO2 particles to equilibrate at the given RH. The combined flow rate through the aerosol flow tube was 5.3 L min−1.
The aerosol size distribution and number concentration was measured over a period of 180 s once during each measurement using a Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer (SMPS, TSI 3081) and condensation particle counter (CPC, TSI 3775), from which the total surface area and average radius of particles can be calculated, assuming that particles are spherical. Scanning electron microscope images of the TiO2 particles used within the experiments showed that these particles are indeed spherical.12 Measurements of the size distribution of the TiO2 aerosols were made at the beginning and end of the aerosol flow tube which showed that there only a small loss of aerosols during transit of the flow tube (<5%).
2.4. HO2 and OH radical detection
OH and HO2 (HOx) radicals were detected by Fluorescence Assay by Gas Expansion (FAGE, detection limit 106 molecule cm−3).15 HOx radicals entered the FAGE cell placed at the end of the flow tube through a 0.7 mm diameter pinhole. In order to detect HO2, it was chemically converted to OH by injecting 50 sccm of NO (BOC, 99.5%) into the resulting jet on the low pressure side of the pinhole. The Q1(2) line of the OH (A2Σ+–X2Πiv′ = 0–v′′ = 0) transition at ≈308 nm was used to electronically excite the OH in the FAGE cell. A Nd:YAG pumped dye laser (JDSU Q201-HD Q-series, Sirah Cobra Stretch) was used to produce the required 308 nm radiation (line width ≈ 0.1 cm−1) at a pulse repetition rate of 5 kHz. The FAGE cell was continuously evacuated using a combination of a rotary pump (Edwards, model E1M80) and a roots blower (EH1200), and was kept at 0.8–0.9 Torr, which was monitored using a capacitance monitor (Tylan General, CDC 11). The FAGE signal was calibrated using a turbulent flow tube calibration method16 which has been developed for field measurements of OH and HO2 radicals, meaning the LIF signal could be converted into an absolute concentration. The calibration experiment involves generating known concentrations of OH and HO2 from photolysis of H2O vapour in zero air in a turbulent flow tube placed immediately adjacent to the FAGE sample inlet.
2.5. Experimental procedure and data analysis
At the beginning of all experiments the FAGE background measurements without the UVA lamp on were taken without and with NO injected into the FAGE cell and subtracted from the OH and HO2 signals respectively, to correct for laser scatter and photolysis of any impurities in the NO which may form OH. The FAGE signal was averaged over 20 s (average of twenty 1 s data points, each corresponding to 5000 laser shots) for each measurement. Eight 20 s measurements were taken during each run. Measurements were made in the absence of aerosols and in the presence of aerosols. Measurements of HOx concentrations produced from TiO2 aerosols under varying conditions were made at different total surface area densities of TiO2 aerosols, RH, light flux and oxygen concentration. The laser power was recorded for each measurement and used to normalise the HO2 signal to correct for any fluctuations in laser power (<5% during an experiment).
The HO2 signal measured at the end of the aerosol flow tube results from several radical production and loss processes, namely wall loss (R14), aerosol uptake (R15), HO2 self-reaction in the gas-phase (R16), production of HO2 from aerosols which have been deposited on the walls of the aerosol flow tube (R17) and HO2 production from airborne TiO2 aerosol surfaces (R18). To obtain the rate coefficient kprod for HO2 production from processes occurring on airborne aerosol surfaces, reactions (R14)–(R18) were all included in a numerical model developed within the Kintecus integrator package (Windows Version 2.80).17 The HO2 concentration measured at the end of the flow tube after illumination for a known period of time was used as the target parameter for the model. (R14) (R15) (R16) (R17) (R18)The HO2 wall loss rate coefficient (kwall) used in the model was determined at the beginning and end of each experiment using a methodology previously described12 in which a sliding injector emitting HO2 was translated down the flow tube in the absence of aerosols (but after the walls have been conditioned in the presence of aerosols). Wall losses increased as RH was increased during experiments. The HO2 concentration as a function of time along the flow tube when determining kwall (as kself is negligible in at the HO2 concentrations of these experiments) can be expressed as: ln[HO2]t = ln[HO2]0 − kwallt(E1)where [HO2]t and [HO2]0 are concentrations of HO2 at time t and t = 0 (i.e. [HO2] at initial injector position) respectively, and kwall is the observed pseudo-first-order rate coefficient for HO2 wall losses. This rate constant was determined in independent experiments where HO2 was generated in the injector as in previous work9 in the absence of aerosols. Similar HO2 concentrations were used in these experiments and in HO2 generation experiments.
The aerosol loss rate coefficient, kaerosolloss, was calculated using (E2): kaerosolloss = 0.25SaωHO2γ(HO2)(E2)where γ(HO2) is the reactive uptake coefficient of HO2 onto TiO2, which was previously measured in this laboratory in the absence of light,12Sa is the surface area density of TiO2 aerosols and ωHO2 is the molecular speed of HO2. The self-reaction of HO2(R16) in the gas-phase contributes a negligible HO2 loss pathway (∼0.01%) at the HO2 concentrations used. The production of HO2 from the surfaces of the flow tube walls and TiO2 aerosols was characterised in Kintecus using eqn (E3) and (E4), respectively: (E3) (E4)where [Wall] is the surface area concentration (cm2 cm−3) of the illuminated walls of the aerosol flow tube (i.e. surface area of the interior walls of the aerosol flow tube divided by the internal volume of aerosol flow tube) and Sa is the surface area density of the TiO2 aerosols, determined by the SMPS. Using [Wall], Sa, kself, kwall, and kaerosolloss as constraints, which are all known for a given experiment, the Kintecus model was used to calculate [HO2] at the appropriate illumination time, which is also known for a given lamp. With the lamp illuminating the flow tube, but in the absence of aerosols (Sa = 0), the value of kprodwall within Kintecus was optimised to give the best fit with measured [HO2] at the end of the flow-tube after the known illumination time. Using this value of kwallprod, but now in the presence of aerosols at a given Sa, the value of kprod was optimised within Kintecus to match [HO2] at the end of the flow tube. kprod describes the rate of HO2 production per unit surface area of TiO2 aerosols, and is expected to depend on experimental variables such as [O2], RH and lamp radiation flux (which itself is a function of Sa). In the following section, the HO2 concentration was measured at the end of the flow tube whilst changing a number of variables, and Kintecus was used to obtain an optimised value of kprod for each set of experimental conditions.
3. Results
3.1. HO2 production by irradiated airborne TiO2 nanoparticles

3.1.1. Variation with aerosol surface area and lamp flux. 
Initial experiments were performed using a carrier gas consisting of either pure nitrogen or 5.9% O2 in nitrogen. Fig. 3 displays the concentration of HO2 measured at the end of the aerosol flow tube (corresponding to 14 s of exposure to the lamp radiation) as a function of the surface area density of airborne TiO2 nanoparticles, Sa. In the presence of O2 a significant increase of gas-phase HO2 was measured as Sa was increased, however when the carrier gas was composed of solely compressed nitrogen at similar RH no significant change was observed. These experiments suggest that the HO2 produced was from the surfaces of irradiated airborne TiO2 nanoparticles via a photocatalytic mechanism involving adsorbed molecular oxygen. A small HO2 signal was detected at Sa = 0 (i.e. when airborne TiO2 nanoparticles were not present in the aerosol flow tube) likely associated with production from previously deposited TiO2 nanoparticles on the walls of the aerosol flow tube and O2 impurities in the nitrogen (estimated at ∼100 ppm). No such HO2 signal was observed after the aerosol flow tube had been cleaned. The small concentration of HO2 produced from the walls at Sa = 0 was included within the Kintecus model using (R17) and kprodwall(E3).
 Fig. 3  Gas phase HO2 produced by airborne irradiated TiO2 nanoparticles as a function of surface area density, Sa, with a carrier gas composed of compressed nitrogen with ∼[O2] = 100 ppm impurity (solid black squares) at RH = 24.0%, and for a 5.9% mixture of O2 (balance N2) (filled red squares) at RH = 16.4%. At Sa = 0, the HO2 is due to production at the flow tube walls. The aerosol flow tube was illuminated with the 15 W lamp. The illumination time = 14 s. 

Fig. 3 shows that HO2 increases as more airborne TiO2 nanoparticles enter the system until a maximum was reached, after which adding more particles results in a decrease in the HO2 concentration. Two processes may account for this. TiO2 aerosols have a large refractive index (2.5 at 500 nm),18 therefore lamp radiation entering the aerosol flow tube will be Mie scattered by the aerosols shading those aerosols below which may result in a drop in the overall photocatalytic activity of TiO2 aerosols, and hence the total rate of production of HO2. Moreover, as the aerosol loading of the flow tube increases the rate of reactive heterogeneous uptake of HO2 by TiO2 aerosols viareaction (R15) also increases and will compete with HO2 production.

Fig. 4 compares the HO2 produced as a function of Sa when the 8 W and 15 W UVA lamps were used to illuminate the aerosol flow tube. As expected, the use of the higher-powered lamp resulted in more gas-phase HO2 being produced, however the 15 W UVA lamp is also longer by 12 cm (40%) resulting in aerosols being irradiated for 4 s longer than with the 8 W lamp and will also account for the higher concentrations of HO2 produced. A similar dependence of HO2 production with varying Sa was observed.
 Fig. 4  Gas phase HO2 produced from airborne irradiated TiO2 nanoparticles as function of total surface area density (Sa) at RH = 8.0% and [O2] = 5.9% using an 8 W UVA lamp (red circles) and a 15 W UVA lamp (black squares) to illuminate the aerosol flow tube. The illumination time for 15 W lamp = 14 s and 8 W lamp = 10 s. The ratio of flux with λ < 388 nm that enters the flow tube emitted from the 8 W and 15 W lamp was 1:5. 
Using the constrained model described by reactions (R14)–(R18), the optimised value of kprod (the number of HO2 molecules emitted per cm2 of particle surface per second) was calculated to give the best fit to the measured [HO2] at the end of the flow tube after illumination. The variation of kprod as a function of Sa is shown in Fig. 5 for both lamps, and shows kprod decreases rapidly with Sa, which is expected given the decreasing rate of production of HO2 with Sa seen in Fig. 4. The inverse dependence of kprod with Sa is consistent with aerosol light scattering reducing the photons per unit surface area interacting with the TiO2 surface. At low Sa, kprod using the 15 W lamp was significantly greater than kprod using the 8 W lamp, which is expected owing to the larger light flux, although the production of HO2 below 388 nm may also be wavelength dependent. However, as the aerosol loading within the aerosol flow tube was increased, kprod using the 15 W lamp decreases ∼3 times faster than for the 8 W lamp, suggesting light from the 15 W lamp is more affected by aerosol scattering. At high Sa, kprod reaches a minimum value which is ∼5 times larger for the 15 W lamp than the 8 W lamp, consistent with the ratio of lamp fluxes for λ < 388 nm of the two lamps entering the flow tube. As seen in Fig. 2 the 15 W lamp emits UV light across a much broader range of wavelengths (275–400 nm) with an average wavelength of 340 nm compared to the 8 W lamp which emits across a smaller range of wavelengths (325–400 nm) with an average wavelength of 365 nm. As the refractive index of a material and the Mie scattering are inversely proportional to the wavelength of light, the 15 W lamp radiation may be more efficiently scattered.

Solid lines represent exponential decays as a guide to the eye. The lamps have different fluxes (see text for details). 
The value of kprod depends on several factors, including the lamp flux λ < 388 nm, F, and a flux-independent rate coefficient, , can be defined as . Fig. 6 shows that values of  decayed exponentially as the aerosol loading was increased in the aerosol flow tube. At the lowest value of Sa (∼1 × 10−4 cm2 cm−3) and using the lamp flux appropriate for within the flow tube, the values of  for the 8 W and 15 W lamps were determined to be 6.4 × 10−4 and 2.3 × 10−4 HO2 molecule photon−1 respectively (see Fig. 6), with an average value of 4.4 × 10−4 HO2 molecule photon−1. This shows that HO2 production was 2.8 times more efficient when using 8 W lamp, likely due to greater levels of scattering or lesser levels of absorbance of light from the 15 W lamp. However, at the highest Sa (∼1 × 10−3 cm2 cm−3) where kprod reaches a minimum and scattering reaches its maximum level the values of  for the 8 W and 15 W were broadly consistent and determined to be (7.4 ± 0.3) × 10−5 and (5.9 ± 0.4) × 10−5 HO2 molecule photon−1 respectively, with an average value of 6.7 × 10−5 HO2 molecule photon−1.

Solid lines represent exponential decays as a guide to the eye. 


3.1.2. Variation with illumination time, [O2] and RH. 
Further experiments were conducted at low aerosol surface area densities (∼1–2 × 10−5 cm2 cm−3) to reduce the effects Mie scattering and aerosol uptake of HO2, and Fig. 7 shows the HO2 concentration per unit surface area measured at 4 different illumination times, which was varied by masking different lengths of the 15 W lamp, and for two different [O2]. The rate of production of HO2 appears to slow down with irradiation time (although not observed it is expected HO2 production would reach a steady-state value at longer time) and increases with the O2 mixing ratio. The observed slowdown of HO2 produced is associated with wall loss and aerosol uptake.
 Fig. 7  Time dependence of HO2 produced by the 15 W UVA lamp at 4 illumination times for Sa = 1.6 × 10−5 cm2 cm−3, RH = 11.0% and at [O2]t=0 = 7.3% (black squares) and 4.4% (red circles) RH = 11.0%. The solid lines are a polynomial fit as a guide to the eye. Error bars represents 1σ of the data points taken over the 20 s averaging period. 
For a fixed illumination time of 14 s (the lamp was unmasked), the dependence of [HO2] at the end of flow tube was measured as a function of [O2] over the mixing ratio range 0–8%. Using the Kintecus model described above, kprod, the rate coefficient for HO2 production from illuminated aerosols was calculated and is shown as a function of the partial pressure, pO2, in Fig. 8 for two different RH. The relationship between kprod and pO2 in Fig. 8 shows typical Langmuir adsorption behaviour, described by the reaction scheme: (R19)with HO2 postulated as being generated from the oxidation of adsorbed water vapour by a photogenerated hole (h+) (R2) to form H+, and reaction of H+ with O2 and a photogenerated e− ((R2) and (R3)).

The relationship between the rate of HO2 formation and the amount of water vapour within the aerosol flow tube was investigated more extensively. Fig. 9 shows that the concentration of HO2 produced per unit surface area decreases significantly as the relative humidity was increased within the aerosol flow tube. As expected from Fig. 8, tripling the concentration of O2 only resulted in a modest increase in HO2 production. Beyond a RH of ∼40% kprod appears to approach a minimum value and H2O no longer has an inhibiting effect to HO2 production. From FTIR studies of TiO2 aerosols in the presence of various RH this corresponds to a H2O surface coverage of 1.6 monolayers.19

Fig. 8 and 9 suggest adsorption of water vapour inhibits HO2 production by reducing the effective surface area of the particle and therefore reducing the number of available sites on the TiO2 particle surface that O2 can adsorb and react on. The total concentration of active sites, [S0], is given by: [S0] = [S] + [H2O(ad)] + [O2(ad)](E5)where [S] is the concentration of unoccupied sites, and [H2O(ad)] and [O2(ad)] are the density of sites inhibited or occupied by water vapour and O2, respectively. The equilibrium constant for adsorption of O2 or water vapour is defined by: (E6)where k1 and k−1 is the rate of adsorption and desorption respectively, A = O2 or H2O, pA is the partial pressure of A and [A(ad)] is the concentration of A adsorbed on the surface. For Langmuir adsorption within the presence of an inhibiting species, the fractional coverage of O2, θO2, defined as the fraction of actives sites on the TiO2 nanoparticle surface occupied by O2, is given by: (E7)where K is the adsorption equilibrium constant for O2 or H2O vapour on TiO2, and p is the partial pressure of O2 or H2O vapour. From experiments using IR spectroscopy Goodman et al.17 showed that at RH = 8.7% and 22.1% the number of monolayers of H2O is 0.9 and 1.2 respectively on TiO2. Assuming reaction (R3) is the rate determining step, the rate of production of HO2 from the TiO2 aerosols (kprod) is then given by: (E8)where kprodmax is the maximum rate coefficient of production of HO2 at high partial pressures of O2. Fig. 8 also includes a fit of (E8) to the experimental data which yielded best-fit values for kprodmax, KO2 and KH2O, which are summarised in Table 1.

A measurement of KH2O onto a TiO2 surface has previously been conducted via a study of the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 with H2O.20 However, key descripancies between the studies make the measurements incomparable; i.e., the measurements in this study were regarding surfaces of airborne Degussa TiO2 nanoparticles, whereas that study concerned a graphene oxide-supported oxygen-rich TiO2 hybrid, which was used to coat the walls of a flow tube. There are no previous measurements of KO2 on TiO2 surfaces to our knowledge.

3.2. OH formation by irradiated airborne TiO2 nanoparticles
OH production from irradiated TiO2 aerosols was also investigated. The FAGE instrument, operated with no added NO in the fluorescence cell, did not see any OH signal from TiO2 aerosols illuminated within the aerosol flow tube. However, this observation might be explained by OH losses to the walls of the flow tube or via reactions of OH with impurities before entering the FAGE sampling nozzle. To test this hypothesis, CO (0.5 L min−1, 5% in air) was added to the carrier gas prior to the conditioning tube to rapidly scavenge any OH generated from the aerosol surface via the reaction: CO + OH (+O2) → CO2 + HO2(R20)Any additional OH signal when CO was added would provide evidence for aerosol production of OH. In the flow tube [CO] = 1.1 × 1017 molecule cm−3, giving an OH lifetime of = 5.5 × 10−5 s, during which it only moves ∼1.4 × 10−4 cm along the flow tube, and other loss processes should not compete. Fig. 10 shows that for aerosol surface areas (Sa) lower than 2 × 10−4 cm2 cm−3 there was no discernible difference between HO2 produced with and without CO present, for RH = 10–12%. However, for Sa > 2 × 10−4 cm2 cm−3, a noticeable difference ([OH] ∼ 8 × 108 molecule cm−3) was observed, providing some evidence for OH production, although the uncertainties are quite high at the largest Sa.
 Fig. 10  Gas-phase HO2 produced by irradiated airborne TiO2 nanoparticles at an irradiation time = 14 s as a function of Sa for [O2] = 5.9% without added CO (black squares, RH = 10.0%) and with added CO (red circles, RH = 11.7%). 
OH is likely produced by the decomposition of H2O2(R11) formed by HO2 uptake, which is more prevalent at high [HO2] and Sa. The mechanism of H2O2 decomposition producing OH and the resulting OH reacting with H2O2, may explain the HO2 observed by Yi et al.4 ((R11) and (R13)). Murakami et al.9 directly observed gas-phase production of OH from irradiated TiO2 surfaces. OH may be associated with H2O2 decomposition rather than from water oxidation, and a theoretical study21 has shown that OH formed by water oxidation on anatase is likely to remain adsorbed on the surface rather than desorbing into the gas-phase and on rutile peroxy intermediates are formed rather than OH.
4. Discussion
Sources of HOx radicals in the condensed phase that have been previously suggested include the uptake of OH and HO2 from the gas-phase, followed by the formation of aqueous H2O2 and subsequent decomposition, as well as Fenton reactions of reduced metal ions and H2O2, and direct photolysis of H2O2, nitrite, nitrate, hydroperoxides, light-absorbing secondary aerosols and iron(III) complexes.22 Although the formation of HO2 from illuminated aerosols containing a photo-sensitizer (imidazole-2-carboxaldehyde) has been measured indirectly by converting gas-phase NO to NO2, this study presents the first direct observations of HO2 radicals generated on aerosol surfaces. These are the first observations of HO2 production from illuminated TiO2 surfaces in the presence of light and O2, but without the presence of added H2O2, which was needed by Yi et al.4 in order to see HO2 from TiO2 films. Unlike heterogeneous reactions involving surfaces or films, heterogeneous reactions involving airborne nanoparticles are not limited by diffusion of gas-phase reactants to the particle surface. To overcome diffusion limitations production from solid surfaces or thin film experiments are often performed at low pressure, however this will not favour adsorption of species with a high vapour pressure, such as water vapour. Yi et al. used pure forms of TiO2 polymorphs which has been shown to enhance photocatalytic activity14 rather than a blend, and surface or thin film experiments often take a number of minutes, so surface saturation and product accumulation may occur on the surface of the sample and could change its chemical characteristics.
The mechanism generating HO2 on irradiated TiO2 surfaces in the presence of O2 is postulated to be (where Vbr, Obr and OHbr are bridging vacancy, oxygen and hydroxyl groups): TiO2 + hν (λ < 388 nm) → TiO2 + h+VB + e−CB(R1) H2O + Vbr + Obr → 2OHbr(R21) OHbr + H2O(g)  OHbr–OH2(ad)(R22) OHbr–OH2(ad) + h+ → OH(ad) + H+(ad) + OHbr(R23) Ti + O2(g)  Ti–O2(ad)(R24) Ti–O2(ad) + e−CB → Ti–O2−(ad)(R25) Ti–O2−(ad) + H+(ad) → Ti–O2H(ad)(R26) Ti–O2H(ad) + hν → Ti + HO2(g)(R27)The reaction is initiated by the production of photogenerated electrons in the conduction band (e−CB) and holes within the valence band (h+VB), which can either recombine or reside in a trapped state or within the respective band. O2 is an effective electron scavenger forming either O2− or O22−. A study of this process on TiO2(101) surfaces23 showed that photogenerated e− can exist on paramagnetic Ti3+ sites or delocalise within the conduction band. At room temperature, most photogenerated e− remain stable within the conduction band rather than in trapped Ti3+ states, however at lower temperatures e− can reside in these traps which could lead to a higher rate of O2− formation. That study observed the efficient production of long-lived O2−, with all photoexcited e− being transferred to adsorbed O2. It is likely that the mechanism for HO2 production would therefore have to involve the reduction of adsorbed O2 with e−CB forming adsorbed O2−(R25). O2− can then go on to react with a proton (R26) formed by the oxidation of adsorbed water via its reaction with a photogenerated h+(R23) located at bridging oxygen sites (Obr) for TiO2(110) and OHbr groups for TiO2(101)24,25 to form adsorbed HO2. This mechanism highlights the contradictory role that water plays in the photocatalytic activity of TiO2, on the one-hand producing active species on the surface of photocatalytically active TiO2 available for reaction (R21) and, on the other hand, reducing the availability and effectiveness of active sites and therefore reducing adsorption of gas-phase species, as shown in Fig. 8 and 9. It is also likely that desorption of HO2 could be augmented by photodesorption (R27) as shown below in Fig. 11:

Adsorption of water vapour may inhibit the reaction by blocking adjacent O2 adsorption sites reducing the effective surface area available and by reducing the O2 adsorption binding energy and hence desorption lifetime. The value of KH2O (obtained from Fig. 8) shows that KH2O > KO2 suggesting that the H2O adsorption enthalpy onto TiO2 is larger than for O2 adsorption and many more water molecules are adsorbed on the surface of the TiO2 particle than O2. This is consistent with studies that have shown TiO2 surfaces become super-hydrophilic when irradiated with UV light.26 Both KO2 and KH2O decrease as RH was increased (Table 1) suggesting that the enthalpy of adsorption of both species is decreasing with RH. Bridging hydroxyl groups (OHbr), formed in R21 by dissociation of water at oxygen vacancy defects in bridging sites (Vbr),27 provide an anchoring point for water molecules to adsorb onto TiO2 surfaces forming OHbr–H2O complexes (R22) which are acidic in character (i.e. OHbr groups act as H-donors).27,28 The enthalpy of water adsorption on these sites is ∼70 kJ mol−1. As RH is increased beyond 11% (RH for one monolayer of H2O on TiO219) a second monolayer of H2O begins to form and H2O binds to the OHbr–H2O complexes, reducing their acidity and resulting in the water binding structure being more characteristic of bulk water28 and a lowering of the H2O adsorption enthalpy, and hence KH2O. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations29 have shown that O2 adsorption onto TiO2(110, i.e. the rutile polymorph of TiO2) surfaces is also entirely dependent on the presence of OHbr groups. These calculations show that the most stable configuration for O2 adsorption is onto two adjacent fivefold coordinated Ti sites (Ti5c) adjacent to an OHbr group with an adsorption enthalpy of ∼77 kJ mol−1. However, many other configurations have an adsorption enthalpy which is only slightly less (∼58 kJ mol−1), e.g. adsorption to a single Ti5c site adjacent to an OHbr group. The calculations also show that the adsorption enthalpy of O2 is dependent on the coverage of OHbr, with higher coverage of OHbr resulting in a higher enthalpy of adsorption and hence a longer adsorption lifetime for O2. The distance between adsorbed O2 and OHbr does not significantly affect the adsorption enthalpy, meaning OHbr exerts a long-range influence on O2 adsorption via the donation of electrons to TiO2 which delocalise amongst Ti(5c) atoms. Upon O2 adsorption, there is a charge transfer from the Ti(5c) atoms to O2(R24), the magnitude of which determines the enthalpy of adsorption. The same mechanism was found for calculations of O2 adsorption onto TiO2(101, anatase).30 The decrease of KO2 with RH and the inhibiting effects of H2O adsorption to the rate of HO2 production observed in this work are likely associated with the formation of OHbr–H2O complexes which inhibits the ability of OHbr groups to donate electron density to Ti5c atoms thereby reducing the adsorption enthalpy of O2 or alternatively, adsorption of H2O blocks more favourable O2 absorptions sites near OHbr. When the surface coverage of H2O reaches ∼1.6 monolayers (at RH = 40%) further adsorption of H2O does not result in further inhibition of HO2 formation (Fig. 9). At sufficiently high RH large amounts of water may condense around the particle forming a liquid layer which may either block access of O2 to all binding sites or any HO2 formed remains solvated within the liquid layer.
A laboratory study investigating the photocatalytic performance of cement-based TiO2-containing materials for reduction of gas-phase oxides of nitrogen (NOx = NO + NO2),34 showed that upon illumination of the material within a standard flow reactor, concentrations of NO decreased from 100 ppm to 20 ppm and continued to fall over the period of a couple of hours until a steady-state concentration of 10 ppm was reached. During this time, gas-phase NO2 was formed in the flow reactor and remained at a constant concentration of 10 ppm, with NO2 potentially being produced via the gas-phase reaction of HO2 generated at surfaces and NO. Furthermore, NO reduction showed a similar dependence to O2 concentration and RH seen in this study.
5. Atmospheric implications
TiO2 surfaces are present in the troposphere, occurring naturally as a component of mineral dusts and artificially as building materials, such as self-cleaning glass or environmental catalysts, or from industrial sources, including the nanotechnology industry. TiO2 nanoparticles are also a candidate for application within Solar-radiation Management (SRM) schemes to mitigate global warming due to their high refractive index and relative affordability.18 It is proposed that TiO2 nanoparticles could be injected into the dynamically stable lower stratosphere in order to back-scatter incoming solar-radiation to space resulting in a cooling effect to the Earth's climate. However, this SRM method carries significant risk, as the photocatalytic production of HO2 radicals from TiO2 surfaces may have the potential to perturb atmospheric chemistry, particularly in the lower stratosphere where HO2 is involved in a HOx catalytic cycle responsible for about 40% of O3 depletion.31 Also, heterogeneous processes are known to influence levels of active chlorine and NOy partitioning in the stratosphere.
During the Saharan Mineral Dust Experiment (SAMUM-2) field campaign held at sea-level in the Cape Verde islands, typical dust concentrations ranged from 10–200 μg m−3 which correspond to surface areas of 2.2 × 10−7–4.4 × 10−6 cm2 cm−3, respectively.32 In this same region, the proportion of TiO2 in mineral dusts was measured to be 4.5% using energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy,33 from which we have estimated a range of effective surface areas for TiO2. The measured values of  presented in Section 3.1 above, which are the light flux and surface area independent rates of HO2 production from TiO2 aerosol surfaces, were used to calculate the HO2 production rate from TiO2 photocatalytic aerosol processes for a typical ambient sunlight flux (using the values at Weybourne, UK shown in Fig. 2) and for a 20% mixing ratio of O2 and RH ∼20%. For the above range of TiO2 surface areas, the rate of heterogeneous HO2 production is estimated to range from 4.5 × 104–1.6 × 106 molecule cm−3 s−1. However, there is considerable uncertainty in this estimate owing in particular to difficulties in obtaining the absolute flux of the lamp within the flowtube. For comparison, the production rate of HO2 from the gas-phase reaction between OH and CO, and assuming typical concentrations of [OH] = 2 × 106 molecule cm−3 (0.08 parts per trillion) and [CO] = 5 × 1012 molecule cm−3 (200 parts per billion), typical of the unpolluted troposphere, is 1.6 × 106 molecule cm−3 s−1. Hence, during periods of significant loading of mineral dust the aerosol production mechanism could represent a significant source of HO2 in the troposphere. However, further studies of HO2 production from morphologies of TiO2 typically found in mineral dust are required to provide a more accurate estimate.
Considering the potential impact on stratospheric ozone chemistry of the production of HO2 from TiO2 aerosols used in SRM schemes, it is important to note that the HO2 production rate is likely to demonstrate a strong temperature dependence, as adsorption is an exothermic process. Further studies which investigate the temperature dependence of HO2 production from TiO2 aerosols at stratospherically relevant partial pressures of H2O and O2 are required to further quantify any impact.
6. Conclusions
Upon illumination of airborne TiO2 nanoparticles with near-UV light (∼300–400 nm) in an aerosol flow tube in the presence of O2 and water vapour, significant quantities of HO2 was observed in the gas-phase. The dependence of HO2 production on O2 shows typical Langmuir adsorption behaviour suggesting O2 is a reactant in the process generating HO2. The addition of further H2O vapour inhibits the production of HO2 and reduces the adsorption equilibrium coefficient for both O2 and H2O, demonstrating the contradictory role of H2O within the photocatalytic mechanism. Reduction of O2 by photogenerated electrons is likely to be the initial step for HO2 production followed by reaction of O2− with a proton produced via oxidation of adsorbed water with a photogenerated hole. The maximum rate coefficient (i.e. when [O2] is projected to atmospherically relevant levels) for production of gas-phase HO2 normalised for surface area and light intensity was found to be  at a RH of 8.7% for the 80% anatase and 20% rutile formulation of TiO2 used here, although this decreased to  as the RH was increased to 22.1%. From surface areas of mineral dust observed at Cape Verde and assuming a TiO2 fraction of 4.5%, the rate of heterogeneous production of HO2 from TiO2 surfaces was calculated to be in the range 5 × 104–1 × 106 molecule cm−3 s−1, with the upper end of this range being similar to the rate of HO2 production from the gas-phase reaction of OH with CO typical of unpolluted regions of the troposphere.
Production of gas-phase OH radicals could only be observed for the largest concentrations of TiO2 aerosols used, and are postulated to be formed from the photo-decomposition of H2O2 formed via self-reaction of HO2 on the surfaces of the TiO2 aerosols.

 	Fig. 1  Schematic diagram of the aerosol flow tube experiment. MCP: multi-channel plate photomultiplier, HEPA: high-efficiency particulate air filter, FAGE: fluorescence assay by gas expansion, RH/T: relative humidity/temperature.	 

 	Fig. 2  UVA emission spectra for the 8 W UVA lamp measured inside (green line) and measured outside (black line) the aerosol flow tube and for the 15 W UVA lamp calculated inside (purple line) and measured outside (red line) the aerosol flow tube, in all cases with the spectral radiometer integrating dome outside the flow tube. In all cases the distance from the lamp to the spectral radiometer integrating dome was constant. The actinic flux (blue line) measured at the Weybourne Atmospheric Observatory (Norfolk Coast, UK, 52°57′N, 1°07′E) on the 1st July 2015 is shown for comparison.

 	Fig. 3  Gas phase HO2 produced by airborne irradiated TiO2 nanoparticles as a function of surface area density, Sa, with a carrier gas composed of compressed nitrogen with ∼[O2] = 100 ppm impurity (solid black squares) at RH = 24.0%, and for a 5.9% mixture of O2 (balance N2) (filled red squares) at RH = 16.4%. At Sa = 0, the HO2 is due to production at the flow tube walls. The aerosol flow tube was illuminated with the 15 W lamp. The illumination time = 14 s.	 

 	Fig. 4  Gas phase HO2 produced from airborne irradiated TiO2 nanoparticles as function of total surface area density (Sa) at RH = 8.0% and [O2] = 5.9% using an 8 W UVA lamp (red circles) and a 15 W UVA lamp (black squares) to illuminate the aerosol flow tube. The illumination time for 15 W lamp = 14 s and 8 W lamp = 10 s. The ratio of flux with λ < 388 nm that enters the flow tube emitted from the 8 W and 15 W lamp was 1:5.	 

 	Fig. 5  The variation of kprod as function of total surface area density (Sa) of TiO2 nanoparticles at RH = 8.0% and [O2] = 5.9% using the 8 W UVA lamp (black squares) and the 15 W UVA lamp (red circles) to illuminate the aerosol flow tube. Solid lines represent exponential decays as a guide to the eye. The lamps have different fluxes (see text for details).	 

 	Fig. 6  The variation of  as function of total surface area density (Sa) of TiO2 nanoparticles at RH = 8.0% and [O2] = 5.9% using the 8 W UVA lamp (black squares) and the 15 W UVA lamp (red circles) to illuminate the aerosol flow tube. Solid lines represent exponential decays as a guide to the eye.	 

 	Fig. 7  Time dependence of HO2 produced by the 15 W UVA lamp at 4 illumination times for Sa = 1.6 × 10−5 cm2 cm−3, RH = 11.0% and at [O2]t=0 = 7.3% (black squares) and 4.4% (red circles) RH = 11.0%. The solid lines are a polynomial fit as a guide to the eye. Error bars represents 1σ of the data points taken over the 20 s averaging period.
