, Accepted 5th July 2023First published on 5th July 2023AbstractIn nature, the elements of the inorganic part of the periodic table are found in three forms: metals, ions in salts & minerals, and ions in solution. The ions may be coordinated to simple or complicated ligands. They may form purely electrostatic or partially covalent bonds. A common trend is that the more covalent bonds an element form, the more we know of its physicochemical properties. The rare earths form purely electrostatic bonds, thus, our understanding of the solution chemistry of these elements is limited—yet important. Most rare earth elements used today pass through hydrometallurgical processes that rely on the solution chemistry of these elements, even through the critical applications are in alloys and functional materials. Through developments in optical spectroscopy, total X-ray scattering, and quantum chemical methods we are posed to remedy this situation: we are ready to create predictive structure–property relationships in the field of lanthanide solution chemistry. The scope of this review is to summarise the state-of-the-art for neodymium(III), to go through the structure–property relationships that are in use. In the form of NdFeB magnets, neodymium plays a crucial role in green energy production and electric propulsion. As a 4f3 ion in solution it is also one of the simpler rare earth ions, and the Nd(III) ion has characteristic optical properties that can be exploited as a handle in physicochemical studies. Here, we start with a critical review of the current concepts used to relate structure and electronic energy levels. We follow with our suggested approach of using the methodology from molecular photophysics to relate optical properties and structure, and conclude with selected literature examples.Patrick R.

1 Introduction
Our understanding of lanthanide chemistry is to a large extend governed by the application of these rare earth elements.4 Kinetically inert gadolinium(III) complexes were the centre of the ascendency of contrast enabled magnetic resonance imaging, which fueled a research effort that created the basis of our current understanding of lanthanide(III) solution chemistry.5–9 Europium(III) and terbium(III) cryptands were developed and refined due to their use in time-resolved immunoassays,10–16 while lamp phosphors and laser media based on oxides, fluorides and similar simple salts were instrumental in mapping the electronic energy levels of these atom-like ions.3,19–23 The highly magnetic lanthanide containing alloys, central in technology and green energy, are the latest catalyst motivating new work in lanthanide chemistry.24–30 The common denominator for all lanthanide-based application is that the raw material comes from a solution based separation process.24,29 Our ambition is to use fundamental chemistry to improve these processes, and we start by compiling the knowledge we have of lanthanide(III) solution chemistry.
Terbium(III) and europium(III) may be easier to study using luminescence,18,31–34 and the electronic structure of ytterbium(III) may be simpler.35–37 But neodymium(III) that is at the heart of both wind turbines and electric drive trains, is probably the trivalent lanthanide ion of greatest relevance,38–41 and that is why this element is the focus of this review. Further, and in contrast to the bulk of the work on terbium(III) and europium(III),42–46 the study of neodymium(III) in solution can rely on both absorption spectroscopy and luminescence spectra. This is possible as the many absorbing transitions in neodymium(III) are comparatively intense (εNd(III) = 0.1–16 M−1 cm−1 compared to εEu(III) = 0.05–1.5 M−1 cm−1) and are sensitive to the crystal field imposed by the ligands coordinating to the trivalent ion.20,47–49 Thus, working on neodymium(III) is both relevant from the perspective of applications and interesting as case of molecular photophysics, as it shifts the focus from luminescence to absorption.50–54
In this review, we start by considering the use of neodymium in general, and the use of the optical properties of neodymium(III) in particular, touching upon the need for efficient mining and recycling of this critical resource. Both mining and recycling require a better understanding of the solution chemistry of neodymium(III). Thus, we move from applications to a description of our current understanding of the chemistry of neodymium(III) ions and the fundamentals of the optical spectroscopy needed to study and establish structure–property relationships.
Optical spectroscopy requires both a theoretical framework and experimental methodologies, which we cover next, before we move on to how theory describes the electronic structure of lanthanide(III) ions. We cover theory both in general, and the semi-empirical parametrization used in the Judd–Ofelt theory in particular. The latter has been used extensively to describe the electronic structure and observed intensity of emission bands in lanthanide(III) ions. We conclude considering some examples from the literature, where we cover examples from both the solid state and solution. With this review we aim to provide a starting point for all who wish to study the chemistry and optical properties of neodymium(III).
2 Applications and recycling of neodymium
Neodymium magnets are used across consumer electronics, transportation, and power generation. Further, neodymium is an essential element for the transition to a green economy and has become critical resource.55–59 Irrespective of the application, whether the neodymium metal has been isolated from virgin ore—or recycled from waste using urban mining—it goes through a process that requires dissolution of neodymium in water, see Fig. 1. In solution, neodymium is present as a trivalent cation. Following this reasoning, understanding the solution chemistry of neodymium(III) is important. A strong argument for detailed study of neodymium(III) chemistry is thus to optimise separation and isolation processes shown in Fig. 1. In solution, neodymium(III) is found in complexes with oxygen and nitrogen donor atoms (Fig. 2), the symmetry and properties of which can be studied using optical spectroscopy. The knowledge from these studies can in turn improve the processes that provide us with this critical element.

To pass into the organic phase, the REE must undergo complexation in the critical water–oil interface in the emulsion. (b) Simple mixer-settler layout with a loaded aqueous and non-loaded organic phase, which is agitated to form an emulsion. The emulsion subsequently settles and the two phases separate with a now loaded organic phase. (c) Individual mixer-settler units can be brought together in serial configurations. (d) The transport of neodymium(III) from the aqueous phase to the organic phase must go through the interphase. Neodymium(III) forms multiple different complexes each characterized by distinctly different crystal fields.

The TTP structure is the typical molecular structure for lanthanide(III) triflate or perchlorate salts of the first half of the 4f series dissolved in water at neutral pH and in methanol. The cSAP is encountered for ligands that introduce steric interactions in the coordination sphere of the lanthanide(III) ion. 
2.1 Critical supply
The supply chain for neodymium, and all the rare earth elements,60–62 is faced with a set of challenges. The rare earth elements are difficult to obtain—not because they are rare, as their common names erroneously implies—but because the rare earth elements share similar chemical properties that renders common separation processes ineffective.26,63–66 In the global effort of transitioning the energy infrastructure into green, renewable solutions neodymium holds an important role,67–70 and as the demand for strong, permanent magnets used in wind turbines and in drive trains for electric cars increase, so does the demand for neodymium.39–41
The supply chain of rare earth elements also face a socioeconomic challenge. By 2010 China produced more than 95% of the rare earth elements. Instigated by political conflict, the price of rare earths soared in the coming years where the price of rare earth sources increased 10-fold to 25-fold.55,70–75
2.2 Separation and recycling
Several methods exist for separating rare earth elements.76–83 For industrial use, the hydrometallurgy method of solvent extraction remains the most efficient, with ion chromatography producing high purity rare earth products at low volumes and liquid–liquid counter-current separation producing decent purity products at high volumes.66,84,85 Both hydrometallurgy and chromatography involves solubilised neodymium(III) ions, and while the processes can be developed and optimised without fully understanding the structure–property relationships involved, understanding the fundamental chemistry will help.
Recycling end-of-life consumer electronics uses the same principles as extraction from natural ore. Although the pre-treatment is different, the solution chemistry used to separate the target products from the acidic leachate is the same.26,86
In addition to the more trivial isolation of neodymium from urban and natural sources, removing neodymium from spent nuclear fuel is also a vital component in increasing the used fraction of the inherent energy.87–89 Neodymium(III) is a large contributor to the loss of fuel performance in nuclear fission cascade due to a large neutron capture cross section.90 Thus studies outside of conventional solvents are also needed, in particular the stability and coordination environment of neodymium(III) complexes in molten salt, where development of new chemistry is needed to enhance nuclear fuel refinement.77 This is also the case for the partitioning and transmutation of spent nuclear fuel.
While most industrial processes in use rely on inorganic acids,91 the use of renewable resources dictate that the extraction should follow the CHON principle, using acids and ligands that have organic origin. Indeed it has been shown that efficient processes can be achieved with e.g. citrate,92 and lactate93,94 combined with traditional stripping agents such as DTPA, EDTA, and derivatives thereof.95
The extraction into organic medium can be done using TALSPEAK65 extractants or similar phosphor/oxygen donors.96–99 The structure of the neodymium(III) ions in the pure phases are established, yet the all-important interface or emulsion structure is still largely unknown.96,100–102 Spectroscopy on neodymium(III) complexes at the interface has already aided the elucidation of the structure of the complexes formed during extraction96,97,100
The hydrometallurgical process illustrated in Fig. 1 is efficient and has seen significant brute-force optimisation.26,66,98,103–105 And while other methodologies of separation has been proposed,24–27,98,106,107 and indeed used previously,108 we see information driven optimisation of already industrialised processes as the best option for a reliable supply of neodymium.
3 Application of neodymium(III) luminescence
While the all-dominating application of neodymium is magnets, the unique optical properties of the trivalent ion have led to specialised uses particularly in lasers.45
3.1 Lasers
The development of high-performance lasers was some of the pioneer work in the field of the neodymium(III) optical spectroscopy.109,110 The laser materials needed high absorption and emission cross sections, and researchers had to deal with technical problems such as material opacity, heat accumulation and neodymium(III) concentration quenching as well.111,112 Early on, there was an interest in using the branching ratios of the two main emission bands 4F3/2 → 4I9/2, 4I11/2 and the excited state lifetimes as indicator for lattice phonon quenching.113–116 The laser community often work in the solid state and has a good grasp of optical properties to characterize laser performance, as well as the structural composition of the laser material.117–121 Further, point group symmetries were often determined to make calculations of line strengths. Although laser development required little or no information regarding the nature of the underlying physical phenomena of the electronic transitions of neodymium, the field started the study of neodymium(III) photophysical properties, and has kept it relevant through the years.121,122 These properties include, but are not limited to, absorption and emission cross sections,111,123,124 peak wavelengths and linewidths,125 luminescence lifetimes,123,126 luminescence quantum efficiencies, and fluorescence quenching from ion–ion interactions.126 The latter is of particular interest as self-quenching is evident in lanthanide(III) photophysics, and in neodymium(III) it reduces the lifetime of the emitting 4F3/2 level, reducing the quantum efficiency of the laser.
The primary concern when developing a new laser medium is increasing the photon throughput. Further, laser materials need to satisfy specific criteria to perform well,111 e.g. non-radiative energy losses in the lasers should be prevented. This is often achieved by using low-phonon materials as laser medium.109 Laser medium and device development has moved well beyond the world of fundamental photophysics. For instance, promising developments in modern narrow band lasers was achieved by monolithic integration of Distributed-Feedback Lasers and Distributed Bragg Reflection Lasers.127
As in molecular photophysics,128 many of the early theoretical descriptors in laser science are for linking experimental observations used to assess laser performance to theory.115 Two of these are intensity parameters—for neodymium(III) in the form of oscillator strengths (f) from Judd–Ofelt theory—and the emission cross sections from Füchtbauer–Ladenburg theory.126,127 As early as 1974, Krupke made a Judd–Ofelt derived version of the Füchtbauer–Ladenburg equation.118 This should be contrasted to the 1962 report from Strickler and Berg similarly linking observed absorption cross section to the Einstein coefficients.129,130 The main conclusion based on the many reports on laser media is that lower symmetry means better lasers.118,131,132 Many modern laser materials have low symmetry for this reason.133,134
The largest remaining issue in neodymium(III) laser media is the heat accumulation. A recurring suggestion is to move to liquid lasers,45,110,112,135 but the other advantages of solid state lasers make them dominate the market. High power neodymium(III) lasers are used for industrial drilling,136,137 laser cutting,138 and dental surgery.139 The power of neodymium lasers can be increased to levels where laser fusion is reported as feasible.140,141
3.2 Upconverting nanophosphors
The many electronic energy levels of neodymium(III) have been used in various forms of upconverting materials.54 From upconversion visible lasers that bypass opacity windows of biological media and access higher emitting states,142,143 to nanoparticles for optical bioassay and bioimaging.12,144–151 Historically, the brighter europium(III) and terbium(III) centred luminescence has been favoured for both biological assays and imaging as the emission is intense and in the visible region.152,153 However, the choice of sensitization ligands for these lanthanides are limited due to the very large band gaps of Eu(III) and Tb(III). To acquire greater spectral range, research has been directed at sensitizers for neodymium(III), erbium(III) and ytterbium(III), and toward inventing new solutions for bio-imaging and diagnostic assays.154–156
Upconversion materials has also been suggested as a means to improve the theoretical limit of solar cells. Specifically, it was shown that the quantum efficiency could be improved from 30% to 47.6%, by capturing the energy of the NIR radiation that is silicon semi-conductor sub-band-gap excitation with neodymium(III) containing upconverting nanophosphers.157 The fabrication and application of these upconverting nanophosphers, typically colloidal oxide nanoparticles, has been reviewed elsewhere.158
3.3 Telecommunication and more
While erbium(III) dominates the area, use cases from neodymium(III) in devices for optical telecommunications have been suggested.159,160 The prevalent use is in optical amplifiers,161–164 where neodymium(III) gives access to two alternate communication bands.165
Of more particular uses it is worth mentioning that neodymium is used in atomic clocks. More precisely in the Cs atomic resonance filter detection system,166 where the neodymium(III) Stark splitting provides an emission band at twice the filters acceptance wavelength.
Similarly, neodymium is used in bismuth germinate (Bi4Ge3O12) materials for high energy particle detectors.167 Neodymium is a critical component in some high performance insulators,168 and in several thin film superconductors.169,170 A more conventional use is as UV absorbers in halogen lamps to remove harmful radition.171
In research, neodymium(III) has been used to create new MOF-designs and provides access to weird topologies in 3D porous networks.172,173 Finally, neodymium(III) has been used in photocatalysis, where the metal has proven an efficient catalyst in both hydroamination and cyclisation reactions.174–176
4 Molecular structure and lanthanide(III) structure–property relationships
Elucidating the chemistry of a compound requires knowledge of its physical structure, and predictive capabilities regarding the physicochemical properties the molecular structure enforces. The molecular structure of a compound is described by constitution, potential stereochemistry, and conformation. The first two describes the connectivity of atoms, while the latter describes the relative position of every atom in the compound. The molecular structure is defined by chemical bonds. Treating all blocks of the periodic table as equal, and using the terminology from inorganic chemistry, the more covalent the chemical bond is and the lower the ‘coordination number’, the greater is our knowledge of the molecilar structure of a compound. The f-elements form high coordination number complexes with non-covalent interactions, thus our knowledge of molecular structure is low compared to e.g. the non-metals in the p-block.
Increasing our knowledge requires that we establish the constitution of the neodymium(III) containing compounds. Little is known of lanthanide(III) solution structure, and the constitution has been debated.32,35,177 At present this leaves two routes to be investigated: kinetically inert complexes,178 and simple solvates. For the former the constitution is unchanged when they are dissolved, for the latter the sample composition can be controlled in a manner that ensures that the constitution is known.35,179,180 In all other cases, determining the constitution of a lanthanide(III) complex in solution is a study in itself.181
With a known constitution, we must consider the possible conformations of the compound. For complexes with a locked constitution, i.e. the number and type of donor atoms in the crystal field is fixed, the position of each atom must be considered, that is, the coordination geometry must be determined. For the kinetically inert complexes, this has been studied in detail.13,182 For the solvates, the structure of the compound can be inferred from the observed properties,179,180 and in some cases experimentally determined.35,183 The deductions rely on the solution to the Thomson problem, and the pioneering work by e.g. Drew.184–186 The solvate structure is the starting point in most solution phase experiments, and if the findings from the europium(III) compounds can be generalized, we can represent the structure of Ln(III) complexes as shown in Fig. 2.
With the molecular structure established, we should be able to predict specific physicochemical properties. In the p-block the possible predictions range from colour to boiling point. In the f-block we are just starting to be able to predict features of the electronic structure, and some optical properties based on the molecular structure of some compound. Although we will postulate that this is only the case for europium(III).187–189
While structure–property relationships can be built from crystal structures,190,191 and while we are able to calculate part of the electronic structure of lanthanide(III) ions,35,192–194 there are still significant work ahead before the predictive capabilities seen in the other blocks of the periodic table are achieved. We need a common language, and a common way of reporting data, in order to expand our predictive capabilities to cover e.g. the complicated 4f3 electronic structure of the neodymium(III) ion. We need to build structure–property relationships, starting with studies establishing the molecular structure of the compound we are reporting the property off.6,181 This can be a unique structure or a known ensemble, but a structure must be declared in order to have something to correlate the observed optical properties to.
5 Optical spectroscopy concepts
The properties of neodymium(III) arise from the 4f3 configuration of the trivalent ion. Neodymium(III) has 364 individual—yet potentially degenerate—electronic states. These states are sometimes referred to as “microstates”, this is misleading as they are genuine electronic states and the use of “microstates” should be discouraged. The electronic states are grouped in multiplets classified with Russel-Saunders term symbols and sometimes described as levels (Russel-Saunders levels). The fundamental nomenclature is compiled in Table 1.

a Note that J is a bad quantum number and that—despite the nomenclature used in the numbering the of the mJ-states—these must be described as mixed states in the prevalent theory: the mJ-levels are not pure states as known in the quantum mechanics of the p-block (px, py, pz), and numbering using |5〉, |4〉 is often preferred.

Coulombic effects and spin–orbit coupling—the coupling of all particle specific spin & angular momenta—group the 364 electronic states into 41 mutiplets of electronic energy levels represented by Russel-Saunders term symbols: 2S+1LJ. In the absence of a crystal field, each multiplet, each Russel-Saunders term, contains (2J + 1) degenerate electronic states. These states becomes non-degenerate when the neodymium(III) ion is in a crystal field. Here, the crystal field splitting lifts the degeneracy of the multiplet of electronic states, partly or completely, depending on the crystal field symmetry defined by the donor set and coordination geometry. However, due to Kramers’ theorem the number of observable states in neodymium(III) in the absence of an external magnetic field is halved: (2J + 1)/2. These doubly degenerate electronic levels are referred to as Kramers levels that each contains two electronic states.
So, when neodymium(III) is introduced to a chemical environment, the crystal field imposed by the surrounding donor atoms perturbs the electronic structure, and these changes can be probed with optical spectroscopy, where the individual 4f–4f transitions are investigated. The bands listed in Table 2 are the ones that can be accessed in optical spectra and changes in these allow the crystal field effects in any neodymium(III) containing compound to be quantified. And if the structure of the compound is known, correlations can be made to the optical properties observed.

5.1 Commonly observed transitions in neodymium(III) spectra
In the lanthanide(III) ions, the 4f valence electrons are shielded behind the 5s and 5p orbitals dampening the effect of crystal field perturbations.2 Thus, even in low symmetry crystal fields, the splitting of electronic states will be on the order of a few hundred cm−1.131 The full 4f energy level diagram of neodymium(III) is shown in Fig. 3, it extends to 68000 cm−1.
 Fig. 3  Energy level diagram of 41 multiplets of neodymium(III) containing a total of 364 electronic states distributed in 182 Kramers levels.195 The purple shaded area represents the most accessible energy levels commonly observed through absorption or emission spectroscopy. 
Absorption spectroscopy is commonly recorded between 400–900 nm (25000–11000 cm−1). The transitions originate from the 4I9/2 multiplet, which includes the ground state. Among the most important excited multiplets are 4F3/2 (880 nm), 4F5/2, 2H(2)9/2 (800 nm), 4F7/2, 4S3/2 (740 nm), 2G(1)7/2,4G5/2 (580 nm) and 2K13/2, 4G9/2 (520 nm). Most multiplets are written in pairs as their similar energy often convolute the resulting absorption bands in solution measurements. The 4F3/2 ← 4I9/2 absorption band is particularly important because it informs on crystal field splitting of the ground multiplet and the principal emissive multiplet. The information can be obtained by analysing the spectra using the mirror image rule i.e. using the emission band from the same multiplets of electronic states: 4F3/2 → 4I9/2.196,197 The most studied band, but probably least understood, is the 4G5/2 ← 4I9/2 band. The intensity of this band is particularly sensitive to the chemical environment and has been observed to change by almost two orders of magnitude.198
The 2P1/2 ← 4I9/2 (430 nm) band is less intense compared to the favoured transitions mentioned above, but the two electronic states in the 2P1/2 multiplet are present as a single Kramers level, i.e. a single line from a degenerate state is observed in the absence of an external magnetic field. This is important for understanding the speciation of neodymium(III) ions in solids and in solution.199
Absorption spectra at higher wavelengths (lower energy) than the 400–900 nm range will typically require specialized instruments as the 4I9/2 → 4I11/2,13/2,15/2 occurs from 1700–5500 nm (Table 2). At lower wavelength (higher energy), competitive light absorption from other species in the medium becomes much more prominent. The system must therefore be tailored for light transmittance at high energy in order to probe the high-energy transitions of neodymium(III), although these are included in Fig. 3, they are rarely studied and are excluded from Table 2.
Neodymium(III) luminescence occur almost exclusively from the 4F3/2 level to the 4I9/2 (880 nm), 4I11/2 (1050 nm), 4I13/2 (1350 nm), and 4I15/2 (1800 nm) multiplets. These transitions occur in the NIR where high instrumental noise reduce the signal-to-noise ratio significantly, rendering low intensity peaks difficult to detect. Therefore neodymium(III) luminescence emission spectra appear less frequently in literature than e.g. europium(III) and terbium(III) luminescence emission spectra. Only recently have NIR detectors become more accessible and can be found in commercial instruments, which allows neodymium(III) luminescence to be used as a probe for a broader field of research.197 Inspection of Fig. 3 show that the 4F3/2 → 4I15/2 (1800 nm) transition should be observed, but it remain elusive, even in the majority of specialized instruments.200,201
5.1.1 Other emissive states. More exotic emissive states can be achieved by upconversion experiments,142,202 or at liquid helium temperatures below 10 K where vibrational relaxation is heavily suppressed. In these conditions, emission from 4G7/2 (530 nm), 4D3/2 (475 nm) and 2P3/2 (320 nm) can be observed.203,204
5.2 Bands, lines, group theory, and Boltzmann population
The free neodymium(III) ion has an electronic structure defined by electron–electron repulsion and spin–orbit coupling giving rise to the 41 multiplets of electronic states shown in Fig. 3. When the neodymium(III) ion is introduced into a physical lattice, a complex, a salt, and in a solution, the electronic structure is perturbed by the collective electrostatic forces of the neighboring atoms in the lattice, ligand, or solvent. The electric field magnitude and symmetry—that is the nature the donor atoms and the coordination geometry—splits the 41 spin–orbit multiplets into 364/2 non-degenerate Kramers levels. This splitting of the electronic states, the crystal field splitting, allows the individual lines to be observed in the optical spectra.
The crystal field description spans over all metal–ligand interactions from exclusively electrostatic to partially covalent. Note that there is strict IUPAC definitions of when crystal field and ligand field should be used to describe the metal–ligand interactions.205 This review is focused on the lanthanide(III) complex. These are almost exclusively defined by the crystal field, the symmetry of which we should try to define wherever possible.
The crystal field perturbs the electronic energy levels of the (2J + 1) states contained within each of the 2S+1LJ multiplets. In the spectra bands refer to groups of spectral lines, corresponding to each of the many transition between the individual electronic states of the initial and the final multiplets. Consider the 4F3/2 ← 4I9/2 transition at 860 nm (Table 2), this band consist of 2 × 5 = 10 transitions between double degenerate Kramers levels. The crystal field alters the energy differences between electronic states, which changes both the Boltzmann distribution within the initial multiplet and the position of the corresponding spectral line.196 Thus, optical spectra are rich in information on the crystal field acting on the neodymium(III) ion.
Predictions regarding the coordination geometry and its effect on the neodymium(III) energy levels can be made by using group theory. The symmetry of the crystal field will dictate the degree to which the (2J + 1)/2 degeneracy of each multiplet is lifted. The half-integer J values relevant to the multiplets of neodymium(III) is listed in Table 3.

All interpretation of absorption spectra starts by considering the initial multiplet of electronic states. The 4I9/2 ground multiplet that in the absence of a crystal field has (2 × (9/2) + 1)/2 = 5 degenerate states. In octahedral Oh symmetry, these Kramers levels become non-degenerate and three lines will be observed. In the lower C2 symmetry, bands from all five Kramers levels will be observed. Note that these considerations does not take coincidental degeneracy into account. Here, the crystal field symmetry may be low, but other factors makes the energy of two or more Kramers levels coincide. This happens often in optical spectra of lanthanide(III) ions. Note that Kramers’ theorem is already applied in this analysis, and e.g. the 5 levels in C2 symmetry are all doubly degenerate and will be split by a magnetic field.
The group theory framework helps us describe the splitting of levels on the energy axis, but at this level it tells us nothing about transition probability. Lines that should be present when considering the crystal field, may not be observed due to a low transition probability. Transitions between specific pairs of Kramers level are not, in general, equally probable. The result is that some lines are strong, while other transitions are too weak to observe. Strictly speaking, all 4f–4f transitions are forbidden because they occur between orbitals of identical parity, and the electromagnetic dipole operator is odd. But in addition to affecting the energy of all states, the crystal field (a)symmetry makes transitions that are strictly forbidden in the free ion, observable for lanthanide(III) ions in condensed phases.
We urge caution when using Laporte selection rules and when using the word “forbidden”. The transitions are sometimes spin forbidden, but always angular momentum forbidden, parity forbidden, and overlap forbidden. Nevertheless, we observe lanthanide luminescence just as we observe phosphorescence. Either we stick with “forbidden” or we simply realise that our current level of theory are not able to describe the transitions that we call “forbidden”. In lanthanide luminescence, the word “hypersensitive” (see below) has been used in a similar manner to describe bands in the spectra that is particular sensitive to changes in the crystal field.20,198 What we do know is that particular coordination geometries and crystal field symmetries affect some transitions in lanthanide(III) ions in a particular way.
A final comment on the degenerate nature of the ground and excited multiplets of neodymium(III) must be made. As each level consists of multiple Kramers levels split by a few 100 cm−1, all states in a multiplet will all be populated at room temperature and the Boltzmann distribution over all the involved levels must be considered. This will be the case at room temperature (T = 300 K, 2kT = 417 cm−1), at liquid nitrogen temperature (T = 77 K, 2kT = 107 cm−1), but the Boltzmann distribution can often be ignored at cryogenic temperatures (T = 4 K, 2kT = 5.6 cm−1; T = 1 K, 2kT = 1.4 cm−1).
6 State-of-the-art in structure–property relationships for neodymium(III)
The previous sections introduced the essential terminology of lanthanide(III) photophysics and for considering the molecular structure of lanthanide(III) complexes. Now we turn to structure–property relationships. To understand why the symmetry of the crystal field around lanthanide(III) ions governs the photophysical properties, it is important to remember that each electronic state represents an electronic configuration of the 4f valence shell. The energy differences between bands arise from the intra-electronic repulsion of the electrons within the valence shell augmented by the spin–orbit coupling. The band structure is unique for each lanthanide(III) ion and is shown in Dieke diagrams.206,207 Further perturbation of the bands is induced by the specific crystal field affecting the lanthanide(III) ion. The crystal field split the bands into lines. If the lines are not resolved, this is observed as a change in the band barycenter, in bandwidth, and in the total band intensity. Remember that all optical properties of the specific lanthanide(III) complex is determined by the crystal field. Do note, that non-radiative deactivation of excited states often are dominated by quenching, which is independent of the crystal field acting on the lanthanide(III) ion.
6.1 Structure–property correlations208,209
As the transitions are between 4f electron configurations, the crystal field symmetry experienced by the central lanthanide(III) ion determines the observed property. To describe the crystal field, the Schönflies notation of labelling point group symmetry is commonly used (Table 3).210–212 As the properties are almost exclusively determined by the donor atoms in the first coordination sphere, only three things have to be considered to describe the crystal field: (1) the coordination number, (2) the coordination geometry described by a coordination polyhedra and a symmetry, and (3) the donor set and the potential reduction in symmetry it causes. We recently proposed a method based on the SHAPE213–226 methodology to quantify (2), but in almost all cases, the system will have broken symmetry.227–229
6.1.1 Using crystal field theory. If the Schönflies-labelled point group symmetry is known, it can be used as input for the group theoretical treatment. It is also a vital input if crystal field theory is used to predict the energy level splitting of the states. Cursory inspection of Table 3 reveals the rather impractical limitation of the symmetry arguments with respect to half-J integer systems such as neodymium(III). In theory, it is only possible to differentiate between cubic symmetry and non-cubic symmetry, but it is nonetheless still often seen that the low CS symmetry will cause a greater degree of splitting compared to e.g. the hexagonal D3h group.
6.2 What can be done for structures in the solid state?
The solid state is best suited for establishing new structure–property relationship. A wide range of X-ray characterization techniques is available, and the coordination environment can be described in single crystals and in most amorphous materials. The scattering approaches are assisted by the fact that neodymium(III) is a strong scatterer. Neodymium(III) ions have been successfully crystallized in several compounds, and an entire library can be assembled on the properties of some systems.48 Unfortunately, lanthanide(III) ions often crystallize in low-symmetry structures enforced by high coordination numbers and packing effects. The result is low-symmetry phases of both simple fluoride structure and more advanced multi-component cuprate structures.3,204,208
Structures of cubic neodymium(III), such as the elpasolite lattices, are rarer, but has been subjects of fundamental photophysical studies including phonon effects in the solid state.230–235 This is true for the other lanthanide(III) ions as well.232,236–241 The high-symmetry systems had a great contribution to our understanding of how structure govern properties as the lower number of spectral lines reduces the convolution of the spectral information, which made interpretation more accessible and accurate.132
If the spectra can be properly deconvoluted and assigned to a certain structure, theoretical models can be used to map each line to a Kramers level, and the mapping can then be used to predict energy levels and transitions probabilities of other systems. This has been done, even to the point of predicting the position of energy levels that cannot be observed in the given system.18,242 The thorough theoretical treatment has predominantly been applied to systems with simple ligands.
The theoretical framework used relies on crystal field theory. For neodymium(III) a total of 28Bka crystal field parameters are needed to describe the crystal field splitting, although the number of parameters included in fitting experimental data decreases when the symmetry increases. In transition metals the high octahedral, Oh, and tetrahedral, Td, symmetries are common and Racah parameters are more common. In the d-block a significantly reduced set of parameters are required. In contrast, the lanthanide(III) ions are typically characterized by high coordination numbers and low symmetry and the number of necessary crystal field parameters are high, which makes crystal field analysis prone to overfitting.203,235,243,244
Another important factor is that the solid state has less line broadening than what is observed from solution. If the solid state sample is measured at low temperatures, the line broadening is further reduced and thermal population of higher lying levels is avoided, see above. In combination, low temperature experiments of high symmetry solid samples are ideal for theoretical development, as both the number and the convolution of spectral lines is reduced.208,209,245 The current state-of-the-art for solids is that we are able to map degenerate electronic energy levels—not the Kramers levels—and to some extent predict the electronic energy levels in highly symmetric neodymium(III) containing materials.
6.3 What can be done for structures in solution?
Structure–property relationships in solution are a different challenge. In contrast to the solid state, where the atomic positions—crystalline or amorphous—are locked, lanthanide(III) complexes in solution are fluctuating in both constitution and conformation. Multidentate ligands can remove solvent from the inner coordination sphere to limit the dynamic exchange of solvent molecules, however, due to the lack of covalent bonding in lanthanide(III) ions, even the most strongly chelating ligands are in rapid conformation exchange.6,246
In the solid state, ligand sterics and packing effects cause a wide variety of coordination numbers, most commonly from CN = 6 to CN = 12.19,247 For lanthanide(III) ions in solution coordination numbers are almost exclusively 9, but occasionally 8 for the second half of the series.35,248 For complexes of monodentate and homoleptic ligands such as solvates in methanol or water, the average structure—the most probable configuration of all the possible dynamic variations—can be accurately approximated by solving the Thomson problem.184 The optimal structure for CN = 9 is the tricapped trigonal prism (TTP) and for CN = 8 it is a square anti-prism (SAP), see Fig. 2.
When the coordination environment is heteroleptic, or if the ligands are multidentate or introduce steric hindrance, the idealized structure change. This can be exemplified by the DOTA and DO3A complexes of CN = 9 lanthanide(III) ions. Here, the ideal TTP structure is rejected in favour of the capped square anti-prismatic coordination geometry (cSAP).228,249
To determine the coordination symmetry of solution complexes standard X-ray scattering techniques are inadequate due to the absence of periodicity in solution. Wide-angle scattering is limited by the sub-nanometer size of the complexes and the absence of repetitive units.250,251 For decades it seemed that X-ray spectroscopy would solve the problem of determining solution structure of lanthanide(III) complexes as the technique probes nearest-neighbour interatomic distances from a central atom. In theory, it is possible to determine bond lengths and solvation numbers, to infer the point group symmetry based on chemical intuition and group theoretical considerations. Unfortunately, the complexity of the lanthanide(III) complexes in solution is rarely captured in broad features of the X-ray spectroscopy data.252,253 Instead we turn to optical spectroscopy and total X-ray scattering.250 Both techniques have been used since the early days of lanthanide(III) solution chemistry.254,255 Traditionally, luminescence has been used as the favoured technique. When it comes to speciation, this has recently been proven to be problematic as luminescence does not correlate directly to speciation.181 For the total scattering experiments, and despite massive improvement in X-ray sources, the issue that 100 mM concentration are required to obtain high quality data remains.6,181 While we have many tools at our disposal, X-ray scattering remains the only direct technique to probe solution structure. Nevertheless, combining our current knowledge of high coordination number complexes, computational chemistry, and all the indirect experimental techniques that informs on structure, we are now able to correlate a property to a specific structure in solution.35,181 But we are not done, and several issues remain:
6.3.1 Issue 1: small structural changes alter the effective point group. The geometries of the ideal TTP and cSAP coordination polyhedra are trigonal and tetragonal, respectively. The positions of the atomic donors are very similar in these the two low energy forms of nine coordinated metal complexes.190,227,228 It has been shown repeatedly using europium(III) luminescence that the two forms have different optical properties, which shows that even small deviations in atomic positions leads to changed properties of the lanthanide(III) ion.189,227,228One example of this is the NdF3 crystals, where the neodymium(III) ion occupy a crystallographic hexagonal Pc1 symmetry, with a point group initially associated with D3h. By comparing optical data, it was later determined that the actual spectroscopic point group symmetry had to be C2.211,256
This discrepancy between apparent crystallographic and real spectroscopic point group symmetry can have significant implications on the electronic properties inferred from optical data. When interpreting optical spectra based on theory it is a minor problem: extra lines may simply be an observation of the actual symmetry, and not due to speciation etc. When creating new structure–property relationships it is a genuine problem. The details of the crystal field splitting in lanthanide(III) ions e.g. when extracting parameters for modeling the electronic structure, are often mapped using an assumed symmetry in order to reduce the complexity of the problem. If the assumed symmetry is wrong, the resulting conclusion will be false. Thus, the structure–property relationships either have to assume no symmetry, or the actual symmetry has to be determined.227,228 Even when only data is reported, the resolution of a given experiment has to be evaluated against the observable. For instance, the resolution of an optical spectrum has to be considered against the expected crystal field splitting. If the molecular structure, the actual symmetry, and the experimental resolution is not evaluated, only ensemble properties will be determined, properties averages over several electronic states and/or averages over several species with different properties.

6.3.2 Issue 2: space group ≠ point group. Another issue of mistaken symmetry is the incorrect assignment of point group symmetry after structural characterisation. It happens that in the solid state, instead of specifying the point group symmetry from the structural data available, only the space group is determined. There are examples, where optical spectra were recorded, but where only the structural properties are of interest to the authors. Here, the unit cell parameters and bond lengths are in focus and the point group of the metal centre is not evaluated. This is often the case in studies of polynuclear neodymium(III) complexes and coordination polymers (incl. metal–organic frameworks).172,173In other works, the point group is inferred by the reported space group. The real point group is important for determination of spectral line energy and intensity, see above. If the space group is used, the author assume that the crystal system impose its symmetry of the space group onto the point group of the metal center.110,119,173,257,258 If the space group is tetragonal, the metal complex point group will also be C4. This assumption is not without merit, if the metal center is positioned on a symmetry axis in the crystal. For lanthanide(III) complexes of multiatomic ligands the structures are often not that simple, and there are cases where the point group is of different symmetry than the space group.259

6.3.3 Issue 3: structure analogues. After the discussion of the importance of the real symmetry, it should be evident that other minute structural changes are important. They can change the effective point group symmetry for the central neodymium(III) ion, but any other change in the coordination geometry will also change the crystal field. The difficulty of determining and declaring the actual structure is one aspect. Another aspect is that the methodology of characterizing lanthanide(III) containing systems has not been standardized, see below. It should be evident that accurate and consistent methods are necessary when working towards creating structure–property relationship for lanthanide(III) complexes.All these issues come to light when using structural analogues of neodymium(III).47,93,260 One common characteristic of the 4f-elements is their exceedingly similar chemistry, assumed to deviate only by modest differences in ionic radii. This similarity has resulted in europium(III) (ionic radius 1.12 Å, CN = 9)261 being used as a structural analogue to neodymium(III) (ionic radius 1.163 Å, CN = 9) due to their small (3.8%) difference in size.47,48
Investigating the electronic structure of europium(III) is appreciably simpler than that of neodymium(III).229,262 Structural information is much more accessible from europium(III) luminescence, and additional tools are available from the properties expressed on the basis of this structural analogue to neodymium(III).47,252,260 Photophysical parameters related to the structure of the europium(III) complex are then transferred as starting values for e.g. energy level calculations in the neodymium(III) complex to obtain better accuracy for the computed values.
However, it is still necessary to be attentive of the real structures of the two systems as the structures of supposedly analogous neodymium(III) and europium(III) compounds have been found to be different on several occasions.173,263 Other trivalent lanthanides (e.g. terbium(III) d(Ln–O) = 2.43 Å) and ytterbium(III) d(Ln–O) = (2.38 Å) have been used as the structural homologues, but this should not generally be done as they often differ more in size to neodymium(III) (d(Ln–O) = 2.49 Å) than europium(III) d(Ln–O) = (2.45 Å).253,261,264
The use of size and structure analogues are often done when investigating the 5f elements due their radioactivity and often low abundance.94,265 By replacement, the chemistry of the 5f elements can be investigated in a safer manner. Americium(III) is typically considered the size homologue of neodymium(III) and several cross-correlation studies have been made between the two.265–267
All in all, the actual molecular structure, the actual coordination geometry and donor set, must always be considered. The properties of lanthanide(III) ions depends of the details of the crystal field, which must be known with high accuracy.

6.3.4 Issue 4: “Hypersensitivity” (4G5/2 ← 4I9/2). A peculiar concept in the field of lanthanide(III) chemistry are the 4f–4f bands that have been labeled “hypersensitive”. Essentially, these are the exceptions that cannot be parametrised by Judd–Ofelt theory i.e. the optical transitions that cannot be described by the theory was simply boxed in and called “hypersensitive”.19,20,268 Note that using molecular photophysics we are unable to describe the transition probabilities of forbidden transitions.35In neodymium(III), all transition probabilities can change by a factor of 2 with structural changes.200,269,270 But the 4G5/2 ← 4I9/2 band exhibits an even larger dependency of the crystal field. For instance, this band has a 5-fold difference in oscillator strength when comparing [Nd(phen)3(SCN)3] in aqueous solution and dissolved in pyridine.20,271–274
The nature of “hypersensitivity” has been ascribed to many properties: complicated asymmetry of the crystal field, ligand polarizability, ligand covalency, ligand basicity, donor number, donor type, chelator conformations etc. Unfortunately, failure to adequately describe and quantify these properties means that no reconciled description of “hypersensitivity” has been found.198,275–281 We suggest that the fundamental theory is revisited instead.19,20,268
Note that the 4G5/2 level is superimposed with the 2G7/2 level. Therefore, the “hypersensitive” band is occasionally referred to as [4G5/2,2G7/2] ← 4I9/2, which of course mislabel the 2G7/2 ← 4I9/2 transitions as “hypersensitive” as well.282,283
“Hypersensitive” bands can be observed for samarium(III), europium(III), dysprosium(III), holmium(III), erbium(III) and thulium(III).2

6.3.5 Issue 5: general asymmetry. The difficulty of characterising the molecular structure and thereby assigning properties to a specific neodymium(III) complex poses a significant challenge, as high quality data becomes prone to over-interpretation. Thus, it can be considered to establish parameters like “general asymmetry” and “ligand types” as simpler descriptors that correlate to the properties of lanthanide(III) complexes.The merit for the “general asymmetry” descriptor is taken from two factors: (1) optical selection rules are relaxed with decreasing complex symmetry i.e. the transition probability is expected to be proportional to complex asymmetry. (2) The transition probability as well as the Judd–Ofelt (JO) parameter Ω2 are expected to increase as the symmetry of the complex decreases.132,284
Classifying ligand types can be done based on chelator properties such as ligand rigidity and denticity and the sterics of the ligand and ligand substituents.279,281,285,286 Pyridine is an example of a ligand that induces strong changes in the optical properties of neodymium(III). Although oxygen is the stronger and harder donor, nitrogen tend to exhibit interesting behaviors that is associated to its more—compared to oxygen—covalent donor character. Alternatively, it is simply the greater polarizability of the pyridine ligand that produce notably larger transition probabilities.272,285 While discussions based on ligand induced changes in properties has merit, proper structure–property relationships cannot be build based on phenomenological descriptors. Thus it become evident that determining the molecular structure in solution is vital for building structure–property relationships for lanthanide(III) complexes. And that these should be compared and contrasted to the solid state, wherever this structure is known.275 Further, it should be clear that the topic is so complicated, that we must use common methodologies and descriptors moving forward.

7 Where molecular photophysics meets lanthanide(III) luminescence
7.1 Electronic energy levels described with perturbation effects
Optical spectroscopy records the absorption or emission of light accompanying a transition between two electronic states, and can be used for determining electronic energy levels in atoms and molecules. For trivalent lanthanides such as neodymium(III), the transitions of interest are the intra-configurational 4f–4f transitions. In order to understand the observations in neodymium(III) spectroscopy, the framework of electronic energy levels and perturbation theory used to describe them must first be understood. The perturbations discussed below are illustrated in Fig. 4.
 Fig. 4  Diagram showing the dominating perturbation effects of the 364 possible 4f configurations of neodymium(III). The atomic (free ion) levels of neodymium(III) produce 364 isoenergetic electronic states (ĤA) and represent the energetic barycenter. These are split by coulombic interactions with other electrons (ĤC), and by coupling of the of the spin and orbital angular momenta (ĤSO). The crystal field act as a perturbation on the 41 spin–orbit multiplets and splits the 2J + 1 degenerate states within each multiplet into the individual mJ or crystal field levels (ĤCF). 
The 4f elements, described as free ions, have seven degenerate valence orbitals that each can contain two electrons. The three electrons of the [Xe]4f3 configuration of neodymium(III) can be distributed in the seven doubly occupied 4f orbitals in a total of 364 different ways; the number can be calculated by the binomial theorem.287
The degenerate picture is not true for any systems with more than one electron. With more than one electron present, coulombic electron–electron repulsion must be considered. This is treated as a perturbation to the 4f3 configuration, which will separate the 364 states into multiplets that we identify using terms: 2S+1L. The terms contain the total spin S and the total orbital angular momentum L, and describe how the three valence electrons are distributed in the seven 4f orbitals.
The next level of perturbation is when the spin and orbital angular momenta couple. This induces further splitting into the multiplets that are observed as bands in the optical spectra of lanthanide(III) ions. Each multiplet is described using the Russel-Suanders term symbol: 2S+1LJ that includes the total angular momentum J. The suggested nomenclature is summarised in Table 1, above.
Each band is a multiplet of individual electronic energy levels, and these electronic states are identified as mJ-levels. These will always be degenerate in the free ion, which is now fully described by the Russel-Saunders term. In any chemical environment, with a crystal field, the Russel-Saunders multiplet splits into individual states. Fig. 5 shows this splitting of the bands in the absorption and emission spectra of neodymium(III) tris-dipicolinate in aqueous solution. This is one experimental example of how the crystal field splitting indicated in Fig. 4 occurs for neodymium(III) in solution. The purple shaded blocks illustrate absorption bands from the 4I9/2 multiplet into higher lying multiplets, while the vertically plotted spectra show fine-structure arising from the splitting of the bands by the crystal field into individual lines. The red shaded blocks similarly illustrate emission bands. The data show the fine-structure obtainable at room temperature in solution.197
 Fig. 5  Energy level diagram showing the most typical absorption and emission bands of neodymium(III). The vertical spectra on the right of the diagram represent the absorption (purple shading) and emission (red shading) of neodymium(III) with tris-dipicolinate in aqueous solution. The 4F3/2 → 4I15/2 (1800 nm) transition is difficult to observe. 
Note that for lanthanide(III) ions like neodymium(III), the individual states will not be resolved as these—in the absence of a magnetic field—are two-times degenerate Kramers levels. So for integer J lanthanide(III) ions the crystal field splits the Russel-Saunders multiplets into sets of 2J + 1 discrete states, while the crystal field for half-integer J lanthanide(III) ions split the Russel-Saunders multiplets into sets of (2J + 1)/2 Kramers doublets.
In summary, each donor in the ligands of neodymium(III) perturbs the energy of the central ions based on relative spatial orientation of donor atoms, their charge, and distribution of the 4f valence electrons. Any change in ligand type or position, i.e. any change in the crystal field, will give rise to a new spectrum.
The crystal field perturbs the energies of each electronic states in the ion, as the electron rich donor atoms of the environment repel the valence electrons of the neodymium(III) ion to a certain degree. The states have historically been described by multiple names including as mJ-levels, Stark levels, microstates, and crystal (ligand) field levels. The fact is that each electronic state in neodymium(III) in the absence of a magnetic field is present as sets of degenerate Kramers doublets, and we need to describe each of these Kramers levels to understand the electronic structure of neodymium(III) ions.
When calculating the energy of each electronic state, the total Hamiltonian consist of the separate contribution of the perturbations, each represented by Hamiltonians in eqn (1) and Fig. 4. 
ĤE = ĤA + ĤC + ĤSO + ĤCF + ĤZ
(1)In eqn (1), the atomic, ĤA, Coulombic, ĤC, and spin–orbit, ĤSO, interactions are considered free-ion parameters and are fitted by up to 20 individual variables. Calculating the crystal field interactions, ĤCF, require another 28 variables. The magnetic Zeeman splitting, ĤZ, is seldom investigated for neodymium(III) and we will not consider it further.
Here, the theoretical framework was introduced in a qualitative manner, and we refer to more rigorous descriptions of perturbation theory for a quantitative treatment.199 We also ask the reader to consider how well theory, developed to describe systems with one electron, is suited to describe these many-electron systems. Note that relativistic effects was not considered, and the fact that J is not a good quantum number was not discussed.
For the structure–property relationship, it is the crystal field Hamiltonian ĤCF that is important. The coordination geometry and donor set of neodymium(III) complexes affects ĤCF. This effect on the individual electronics states can be measured using optical spectroscopy as the position of the corresponding lines. Four types of changes can be seen in the spectra: (1) changes in transition energy, (2) splitting of degenerate spectral lines (or the reverse, coalescence of lines already split), (3) broadening/narrowing of spectral lines/bands, and (4) changes in line/band intensity. In the following, the explanations currently used to correlate the experimental observations to theoretical description will be described.
7.2 4f–4f transition and selection rules
In the first recorded absorption spectra of rare earth compounds, spectral lines appeared with intensities several magnitudes weaker than what was generally expected for electronic dipole (ED) transitions.288,289 It was not before the 1930ies that it was realised that the weak transitions were parity forbidden transitions between 4f electronic configurations.290–292 From the Laporte selection rules, transitions between orbitals of the same parity e.g. fu ↔ fu are forbidden because the electric dipole operator u of electromagnetic radiation is ungerade. This, however, is only true in perfect centrosymmetric systems. As described above, it is very hard to achieve perfect symmetry, and in any crystal field where the symmetry deviates slightly from the ideal, the weak 4f–4f transitions can be observed as 〈ψf∣∣ψi〉 then becomes non-zero.
In the framework of crystal field theory, the relaxed restrictions on the Laporte selection rule emerge because the f-orbitals mix with the wavefunction of the lowest lying unoccupied d-orbital with gerade parity. Note: this requires the assumption that a several thousand wave number energy difference between the two states can be ignored. The d–f mixing introduces a small amount of opposite parity into the ungerade f-orbital, which makes the transition mathematically possible.293 The orbital mixing is always described as weak in f-elements, in particular when compared to the d-block elements.2 This is a consequence of the limited radial distribution of 4f-orbitals that retract the valence orbitals behind the 5p orbitals of the core shell. Thus, the 4f valence electrons are shielded from the majority of the electric field imposed by coordination environment. In contrast, valence d-orbitals extent beyond the core shell, and these are 30–50 times more sensitive to the environment.294 This also result in larger orbital mixing, and a strong relaxation of the Laporte parity rule in the d-block.
The Laporte parity rule is the most fundamental selection rule that makes the intra-configurational 4f–4f transitions “forbidden”. The “forbidden” nature manifests in absorption spectra as very low molar extinction coefficient. If the nature of the transitions are assumed to arise from electronic dipole transition moments, the reduction is up to 4 orders of magnitude compared to parity allowed f–d transitions of a similar nature.
7.2.1 General angular momentum selection rules. In any given discrete quantum system, electric dipole transitions are governed by a set of fundamental selection rules: essentially conservation of momentum and conservation of energy. From these, various selection rules based on early quantum mechanics have been derived, see Table 4. These arise from assuming that light has an angular momentum of 1, there can be no change in spin, and energy and momentum must be conserved. The rules are used by assessing the quantum numbers of the states involved, and the transition is “allowed” if the selection rules are satisfied. If the spin change or the states involved does not satisfy the selection rules the transition is “forbidden”.

With crystal field methodology and definitions describing electrostatic repulsion and coupling, it should be possible to calculate the position of lines on the energy axis. With the selection, rules it should be possible to predict the transition probability of a lines on the intensity axis. If coordination geometry is introduced in this framework, symmetry can be used to design structures with a specific lines at known energy and intensity. We are not there yet, and does not have predictive capabilities. However, experimentalists continue to supply data on the three observables: transition energy, crystal field splitting, and line intensities, so that modifications to the fundamental selection rules in Table 4 can be developed.

7.2.2 Modified selection rules from Judd–Ofelt theory. When a higher-lying ungerade configuration of the 4f shell admixes with a gerade state of e.g. a d-shell electric dipole transitions becomes “allowed” according to a strict mathematical treatment. These transitions are in the Judd–Ofelt framework called induced or forced electric dipole transitions, to indicate that these transitions occur only through an admixture of states. These induced electric dipole transitions benefit from an expanded set of selection rules.295 Most significant is the fact that ΔL and ΔJ are no longer restricted to 0 or ±1, but can instead take values of |ΔL/J| ≤ 6, see Table 4. The selection rule governing the change in spin remains, but continues to be ignored for most transitions. The large range of “allowed” transitions through these new selection rules connect virtually any two 4f configurations, but require that you do not consider conservation of momentum or energy to be important.In Judd–Ofelt theory, the induced electric dipole (IED) transitions facilitate transitions between same-parity states through an electric dipole moment when orbitals admix. Another possibility is for transitions to occur through direct mechanisms that link states of same parity through the magnetic dipole moment and the electric quadrupole moments. Coupling of states through a magnetic moment is perfectly allowed between states of equal parity, but it is inefficient. According to Judd–Ofelt theory, the line intensities of magnetic dipole transitions are therefore equal to or an order of magnitude smaller than induced electric dipole transitions. Compared to electric dipole moment mediated transitions, magnetic dipole moment mediated transitions are assumed to be less perturbed by crystal field effects. This predicts that some band/line intensities dependent less on the coordination environment. This assumption is unfortunate, as it on several occasions has led to people using the magnetic dipole (MD) transition intensities as intrinsic standards.296 This trend is problematic, since the band intensities are insensitive, but not unaffected by the crystal field. Changes in the line intensities has been observed to change with at least a factor 2.181
From a mathematical standpoint, the electric quadrupole operator is another pathway to make allowed transitions between states of equal parity. Quadrupoles are symmetrically arranged point charges alternating in sign with a net zero electric moment. Electric quadrupole transitions are very weak and are not experimentally resolved in lanthanide(III) ions under standard conditions. We note that the “hypersensitive” transitions of the lanthanide(III) ions are often associated with the electric quadrupole transition selection rules by people using the Judd–Ofelt framework. They are sometimes called pseudo-quadrupole transitions, because although the quadrupole selection rules are obeyed (to some degree), their transition intensities are several orders of magnitude greater than what could be expected when considering that the quadrupole light-matter interaction is described by the third term in the multipolar Taylor series. Of particular interest, in the LS coupling scheme when spin and orbital angular momenta couple weakly (not the case in lanthanides), the selection rules for the electric quadrupole is |ΔL| = 0, ±2 when ΔS = 0. This fits with the “hypersensitive” transition 4G5/2 ← 4I9/2 in neodymium(III), but is not always satisfied for other “hypersensitive” transitions.
We will argue that aside for conservation of energy and momentum, there are no selection rules that can be used for “forbidden” transitions. When work arise on linear polarisation of lanthanide luminescence, we will have experimental proof of which operator that dominates the observed bands. Dipolar transition as maximum anisotropies of r = 0.4, induced dipolar transitions have maximum anisotropies of r = 1.0.

7.3 Neodymium(III) spectroscopy and selection rules?
In absorption spectroscopy, all neodymium(III) transitions originate from the 4I9/2 level since the next level 4I11/2 is ∼2000 cm−1 higher in energy. This corresponds to a population <0.1% at room temperatures.
In crystals of Nd:LaF3 the total crystal field splitting of the 4I9/2 level is ∼500 cm−1. In this case, the Boltzmann distribution predict that the highest state within the multiplet has 8% of the total population at room temperatures, and it must be noted that an uneven population distribution exist in the 4I9/2 multiplet in this crystal field. The population distribution of the absorbing level is even wider in solution, where the 4I9/2 multiplet is broadened with total crystal field splittings up to ∼1000 cm−1 in some cases.
The experimental determination of absorption line energies and transitions probabilities of stimulated absorption rely on absorption spectroscopy. Performing this type of experiments on neodymium(III) containing samples are commonly limited to the extended visible range from 400–900 nm, see Fig. 6. At 900 nm the low-energy edge of the 4F3/2 multiplet begins. The transition from the 4I9/2 multiplet to the other 4IJ multiplet with J = 11/2, 13/2, 15/2 are too low in energy—between 1600 and 5000 nm—to be easily recorded.131 This prevent efficient detection of these transitions even in specialised equipment that commonly covers a range down to 3300 nm. The 400 nm upper limit of standard neodymium(III) absorption spectra is set by lattice, ligand, and solvent absorption, especially in organic complexes where the absorption edge starts around 400 nm.
 Fig. 6  Absorption spectrum of neodymium(III) in D2O, exhibiting the typical accessible region of 400–900 nm, with absorption from the 4I9/2 level and including transitions to the 2P1/2 level at 430 nm and to the 4F3/2 level at 880 nm. 
Within the 400–900 nm range, the major bands are at 860 nm, 800 nm, 720 nm, 580 nm, 500 nm, and the transition from 4I9/2 to the single 2P1/2 multiplet is at 430 nm.
The intensity in absorption spectroscopy is measured in absorbance A, which is an arbitrary value that depend on both spectral path length and concentration of the neodymium(III) species. For this reason, it is preferable to use the molar extinction coefficient ε whenever possible, because ε is an invariant property of each observed species. All transitions observed in the absorption spectrum in Fig. 6 is “forbidden” and the band at 580 nm carries the label “hypersensitive”.
Assuming that the Kasha–Vavilov rule is valid, all excited states of neodymium(III) will relax to the 4F3/2 multiplet prior to emission. This level has a 5500 cm−1 energy gap down to the 4I15/2 multiplet. This energy gap is large enough for the rate of non-radiative processes to be so slow, such that the rates of spontaneous emission are competitive. As all transitions are “forbidden” the rates of spontaneous emission are low, and as all multiplets bar two are separated by no more than 2000 cm−1, the rates of non-radiative deactivation are high. The consequence is that neodymium(III) is a weak luminophore. It is worth noting that the energy gap between the 2F5/2 (258 nm) multiplet and the 2L17/2 (314 nm) mulitplet in the UV is 7000 cm−1. This is the largest energy gap between two excited states in the neodymium(III) ion.
The 4F3/2 multiplet can emit and end in the 4I9/2 multiplet (880 nm, 11400 cm−1), the 4I11/2 multiplet (1050 nm, 9500 cm−1), the 4I13/2 multiplet (1350 nm, 7400 cm−1), and the 4I15/2 multiplet (1800 nm, 5550 cm−1). The intensity of the 4F3/2 → 4I15/2 transition is usually low and rarely observed as it requires insensitive lead surface or broad range InGaAs detectors not commonly seen in commercial instruments. Most attention has been focused at the 4F3/2 → 4I9/2 and 4F3/2 → 4I11/2 transitions due to their significant intensity. The relative intensity between these two bands has been used as a benchmark for performance of neodymium(III) based laser spectroscopy.113,114 The 4I13/2 band at 1350 nm can be observed in dedicated instruments, but it is not easy. The energy gap between 4F3/2 to the lower lying multiplets has historically posed a challenge to observing neodymium(III) luminescence.297 And the problem is two-fold:
(1) Quenching of the excited state occur through coupling to vibrational states of solvents, ligands, and lattice phonons. For instance, the O–H stretching vibration in water can receive quanta of 3400 cm−1. The energy gab in neodymium(III) is bridged already at the 2nd overtone. Therefore, the rate of quenching outcompetes the rate of emission with a significant margin. Thus, the luminescence quantum yield from neodymium(III) is low.
(2) The detector efficiency at the NIR-range is poor. NIR detectors lack quantum efficiency, in particular compared to UV-visible detectors where we are used to single-photon sensitivity. Further, NIR detectors are subject to large levels of noise.297 Only in the last decade, commercial NIR spectrometers has become readily available. These have both good quantum efficiency and cooling for reducing noise.
As all transitions of interest in neodymium(III) are “forbidden”, cooling a sample to liquid helium temperatures opens up access to more exotic higher emissive states. When the non-radiative processes are slowed, certain multiplets will emit despite small ∼2000 cm−1 energy gaps. By cooling to below 20 K, emission from 4D3/2 and 2P3/2 can be observed.142,203,204,231,298 These two high energy multiplets radiatively deactivates into the four 4IJ multiplets in the range from 355 to 465 nm.
Whether you consider many selection rules to be active in neodymium(III) spectroscopy, or you accept that the transitions are simply “forbidden”, the experimental outcome is the same. Bands consisting of a number of lines are observed, and the only handles we have on these are structure and temperature. Fortunately, we have a framework to analyse each transition provided by molecular photophysics.
7.4 Transition probabilities
Absorption and emission intensities can be described by several different experimental parameters:299,300
• D – dipole strength,
• f – oscillator strength,
• ε – molar absorbance coefficient,
• A – absorbance,
• σabs – absorption cross section,
• μ – transition dipole moment,
• S – line strength,
• A21 – Einstein coefficient of spontaneous emission,
• B12 – Einstein coefficient of (stimulated) absorption,
• B21 – Einstein coefficient stimulated emission,
• τrad/τ0 – radiative lifetime, and
• krad/kr – radiative rate constant.
The subscripts 1 and 2 of the Einstein coefficients indicate a lower and upper state, respectively. Each parameter bears a distinct physical meaning, yet have numerical values that are very different. This can make comparing between reports difficult.301,302
Let us first consider the most common experimental data. From spectroscopic experiments, the absorbance A is readily determined. If the concentration is known, the absorbance can be converted into the ensemble parameter ε, or the single molecule absorption cross section σabs. Emission data are less accessible. These are given in photon counts or photon counts per time unit, and are strongly affected by experimental conditions and instrumentation. To convert these to parameters related to molecular properties more measurements are required. If these are done well, radiative lifetimes τrad and rates of spontaneous emission A21 or kr can be determined.
To compare experimental values to theory, molecular photophysics introduces the dimensionless oscillator strength f. This parameter is readily used to describe the strength of a line in terms of quantum mechanics of a single-electron operator: 
(2)where the integral over ε is the area of any absorption band or line and ṽ is the energy of the transition in wavenumbers (cm−1). The energy can in principle be obtained from both absorption and emission spectroscopy as the relationship between f of absorption and emission is defined from the degeneracies of an upper level 2 and a lower level 1:300 
g1f12 ≡ −g2f21
(3)but in real life the values determined from luminescence and absorption measurements are often different. It should be noted that the theory was developed to describe “allowed” transitions between the vibronic envelopes of organic molecules. Since, the oscillator strength has been used to map both “allowed” and “forbidden” transitions experimentally.303 For electric dipole allowed transitions f takes values from 1 to 0.01, but become as small as 10−7 for the lanthanide(III) ions due to the forbidden nature of the transitions.20,304–306
The oscillator strength f serves as common ground between molecular photophysics, lanthanide(III) luminescence, and laser physics.126,300,306,307 The oscillator strength is defined classically, and determined experimentally. From a quantum mechanical standpoint, the transition between two electronic states is best described by a probabilistic value tied to a rate constant. For this purpose, the Einstein coefficients A and B were developed. Coefficient A is for spontaneous emission, and is a rate constant with the unit of s−1. In luminescence spectroscopy A is equivalent to the experimentally determined rate of luminescence kr. Thus, the radiative lifetime of a transition τrad is defined as the reciprocal of the radiative rate constant and the A parameter of the transition: 
(4)Here, the general definition describe the rate of emission from an upper state, 2, to a lower the lower state, 1. From the definitions of Einstein coefficients, the expressions of A21 can be constructed in terms of the oscillator strengths f: 
(5) 
(6)Here,  is the vacuum permittivity, c the speed of light, and m and e are the mass and charge of the electron. g2 and g1 are the degeneracies of the upper and lower states, respectively. The f values are the oscillator strengths of the transitions at energy ṽ in wavenumbers, cm−1.
Einstein's B coefficients for stimulated absorption B12 and stimulated emission B21 are also rate constants, but can also be defined from the energy density of the inductive radiation yielding units of m3 in the most general forms: 
(7) 
(8)Here, the expressions are defined using wavenumbers as units of energy (cm−1) and it is necessary to be aware of conversion factors if other units of energy, such as frequency v = cṽ, are used. Since both A and B are proportional to f, it is obvious that a change in the oscillator strength change both A and B in the same direction.
It is important to note that the expressions given above are the general form and variations of these exist for different definitions for light intensity. If the experimentalist have no further knowledge of the experimental conditions or definitions, it is recommended to use the expressions as is given here.300
A parameter similar to the oscillator strength f is the less common dipole strength D that is related to f by: 
(9)Finally, the transition probabilities can also be described using cross sections σabs, as commonly done in laser research. The cross sections are also required due to their connection with the Judd–Ofelt theory.118,308 Laser irradiation have two fundamental differences from the conventional arc lamp excitation. The high intensity of the incident laser beam significantly change the population ratio of the ground and excited states, and the spectral line width of most transitions are wider than the narrow bandwidth of the laser.
The absorption cross section can be calculated from the Einstein coefficients, and could therefore also be related to the oscillator strength if need be:300 
σabs = 2πħṽB12g(ṽ)
(10) 
(11)Here, g(ṽ) is the spectral line shape and g1/2 the degeneracies of the ground and excited states. The relations to the cross section is shown here to illustrate its value in comparison to other intensity parameters, but is not useful in the rudimentary form shown above. While the cross sections are rarely used for low intensity broadband light sources, it is recommended to become familiarized with the more extensive derivations of the cross sections if a monochromatic, high intensity laser is used:309,310 
(12)The Einstein coefficients are also defined in quantum mechanics and the Strickler–Berg equation translates between experimentally determined parameters and theoretically computed properties. It should be noted that theory, from the point of an experimentalist, only can reproduce transition energies and intensities for allowed transitions. And that the semi-empirical methods, such as ZINDO,311 still outperforms even the most expensive ab initio methods for real dyes and lanthanide(III) complexes.
7.5 Line shape
The spectral line shape function, g(ṽ), describes the deviation from an infinitely narrow line as described by e.g. a step function. In the most simple form the natural spectral line shape takes a Lorentzian profile due to the Doppler effect and lifetime broadening.309 This happens as energy resolution of a transition is inversely proportional to the lifetime of the excited state.312
Outside the world of atomic spectroscopy, the Gaussian distribution dominates due to what is essentially inhomogeneous broadening. All degrees of freedoms in a molecular system gives rise to an ensemble of atomic positions, which in turn gives rise to wide bands in the optical spectra. The f-elements represent one of the few cases of molecular systems, where anything except Gaussian line shapes must be considered (excluding exciton coupling).
In lanthanide(III) ions, inhomogeneous broadening occur from differences in speciation, see above. If only one species is present and that in a single coordination environment, inhomogeneity from small differences in the site geometry of the lanthanide(III) ion will still be present. There are several examples where inhomogeneous broadening is significant for solution phase lanthanide(III) spectroscopy,181,265 and it has been shown to contribute in the solid state.313 Even so, the intraconfigurational transitions of lanthanide(III) ions are often so atom-like that a Lorenzian function can be used to fit most lines.196 It requires that each line is resolved, and that the resolution of the data is high enough to describe the line shape. If the resolution is too low, the line shape will be that of the slits of the spectrometer. If the lines are not resolved in the data, they may be resolved by deconvolution with a suitable number of Lorenzian functions, or the band may be fitted to a Gaussian function.
As the true line shape is Lorentzian but ensemble effect contribute a Gaussian shape, a Voigt function is often the most accurate description of experimental data. The Voigt function is a linear combination of a Lorentzian and a Gaussian function. A larger Gaussian contribution can be used when needed e.g. for solution studies. It must be noted that when using Voigt functions described by eqn (13), the added fitting parameters can make overfitting a problem. 
g(ṽ) = a1h(ṽ)·a2k(ṽ)
(13)The Voigt profile g is the linear combination of the Lorentzian profile h and the Gaussian profile k. If either of the weight factors a1 or a2 approaches 0, the Voigt function will convert to either of the two functions.
7.6 Luminescence lifetime and non-radiative deactivation
Changes in the spectral intensities for absorption for the lanthanide(III) ions can be attributed exclusively to the crystal field acting on the ion. Emission intensity is dictated by site symmetry and donor set, but is also affected by the energy gap law, which states that the rate of non-radiative decay knr increases exponentially as the energy difference ΔE between the emitting 2 and final state 1 decrease:314,315 
(14)As stated in the previous section, the transition probability is related to the radiative rate constant A, but experimentally the derived quantity is usually the excited level radiative lifetime τrad determined form the quantum yield of luminescence and the excited level lifetime τobs. Note that the A of the individual states rarely can be resolved, yet, from Strickler–Berg the relationship is known: 
(15)Where n is the refractive index, ṽ21 the average transition of the band containing the g1·g2 transitions, g the upper and lower multiplet degeneracies and ε the integrated molar extinction coefficient of absorption. The principal emissive multiplet of neodymium(III) is the 4F3/2 level at ∼11500 cm−1. τrad from this level is in the range of 10–500 μs.111,316,317
The observed lifetime measurements contain the sum of all decay processes, including the non-radiative processes like energy transfer and matrix interactions as vibrational quenching and lattice phonon coupling:306,318 
(16)The non-radiative contribution can be major and can for neodymium(III) lead to nanosecond observed lifetimes in water (τobs = 29 ns) or methanol (τobs = 68 ns). The large difference in τrad and τobs in neodymium(III) systems imply that the excited levels deactivates non-radiatively two orders of magnitude more efficiently than through the radiative pathway. Examples of determined lifetimes can be seen in Table 5.

The dominant factor of the short experimental luminescent lifetimes (τobs) of neodymium(III), compared to the millisecond lifetimes of europium(III) and terbium(III), is the small energy gap between the low-lying emitting 4F3/2 mulitplet and the 4IJ multiplets that spans about 5000–11000 cm−1 and give rise to near infrared emission.
In solvents rich in O–H (3450 cm−1) or C–H (2950 cm−1) oscillators this gap is bridged by no more than two or three vibrational quanta.131 Thus, the simplest way to increase the luminescent intensity is by decreasing the non-radiative pathways e.g. by changing the solvent to something with low vibrational energies. Simply by using DMSO a 60-fold increase in luminescent lifetime compared to water can be achieved.297 Low phonon solid matrixes can do the same as illustrated by the data in Table 5.
The solvent itself can also be modified by deuteration i.e. removing the C–H and O–H oscillators in the solvent molecules. Fig. 7 shows how deuteration can increase the vibrational energy quanta needed to quench by a third. This induces a reduction in knr, and gives rise to a 5-fold increase in the luminescence lifetime.131,297
 Fig. 7  Schematic representation of common solvent vibrational energies. The small energy gap of the neodymium(III) 4F3/2 emissive multiplet is bridged and consequently quenched by only a few vibrational overtones. Adapted from Yanagida et al. 1998.131 
Research lead by Yanagida and coworkers has employed deuteration and fluorination strategies, together with asymmetric ligand designs and polymeric structures, to obtain high observed luminescent lifetimes and quantum yields in solution for neodymium(III) complexes. The record is τobs = 14.5 μs in solution.131,132,269,322–326
In the solid state the equivalent of oscillator quenching is phonon quenching, but here there are more freedom to design lattices with low phonon energies, and in the solid state a phonon energy of 1300 cm−1 from a cyclo-triphosphate327 would be considered large compared to certain fluoride glasses and sesquioxides, where phonon energy can become as low as 400 cm−1.109,126,142,328 At these phonon energies the band gap of >5000 cm−1 for the 4F3/2 → 4I15/2 transition must be bridged by more than 10 phonon quanta. This makes the phonon quenching by the lattice inefficient.204
It is the interplay between the rate of non-radiative and radiative processes that dictate whether luminescence is observed. It has been stated that if the gap beneath an energy level is larger than 4 phonon quanta, luminescence could potentially be observed.204,233 Multiplets in neodymium(III) with energy gaps that could potentially be large enough to satisfy this requirement are 2F(1)7/2 (64300 cm−1, gap ≈ 12000 cm−1), 2G(2)9/2 (46700 cm−1, gap ≈ 7000 cm−1), 2F(2)5/2 (37900 cm−1, gap ≈ 3500), 4D3/2 (27700 cm−1, gap ≈ 1500 cm−1), 2P3/2 (2600 cm−1, gap ≈ 2200 cm−1) and of course the 4F3/2 (11400 cm−1, gap ≈ 5500 cm−1) multiplet, but samples must be cooled to liquid helium temperatures to observe emission bands corresponding to these transitions.
A different non-radiative process must be considered for samples with high concentrations of neodymium(III) ions.329 Cross-relaxation occur because the energy of the 4F3/2 → 4I15/2 emission is similar to the 4I15/2 ← 4I9/2 absorption process. Another concentration dependent process is excitation migration where the emitted photon from the 4F3/2 → 4I9/2 band is reabsorbed and reproduce the same excited state. These processes are most often encountered by the laser community, where neodymium(III) doping above a certain percentage–often about 1% (but up to 5% in some materials)330,331 cause concentration quenching, which lowers the effective power of the laser. This is equivalent to HOMO FRET, and although the HOMO FRET process is non-radiative it can be confused with the re-absorption of emitting photons in laser media.
7.7 The number of coordinated solvent molecules, q
Horrocks’ method of approximating the number of solvent molecules in the inner coordination sphere or q is widespread and should be mentioned. Horrocks’ method allows q to be determined for europium(III), terbium(III), ytterbium(III), thulium(III), and samarium(III), while the less precise Kimura/Kato method also extend to curium(III) and americium(III).318,332,333 From the difference in lifetime in deuterated and non-deuterated solvent, the number of solvent molecules in the first coordination sphere can be determined: 
(17)where A and B are inner and outer sphere corrections. These are different for each lanthanide(III) ion. The A and B values are derived from the slope and intercept of the linear fit of lanthanide(III) complexes in both solvents. These also take the oscillator numbers and types into considerations such as C–H vs. O–H vs. N–H. The error on q is generally ±0.5. The values derived when using the Kimura method is highly pH dependent and may have an error up to ±1.8. Similar studies has been done on neodymium(III) complexes, but results indicate that the A and B values are highly environmentally variable and with particular complications from C–H oscillators.34,258,266,334
8 Experimental determination of electronic energy levels and transition probabilities
8.1 First steps
Spectroscopy is a tool used to determine the energy levels of the electronic configuration of the analyte, in this case neodymium(III). Although rare earth elements have been identified and optically measured since the beginning of the 20th century,22 it was not until the 1950ies that the industrial isolation methods and the field were sufficiently developed to ensure that impurities could be identified in the spectroscopic analysis.22 In the following decade, the electronic spectra of neodymium(III) were assigned in detail using atomic spectroscopy for the high energy multiplets and using infrared absorption spectroscopy of anhydrous neodymium(III) salts to probe the 4IJ ground state multiplets.22,23,206,207,335,336 These experiments resulted in the established Dieke diagrams.206,337
During the next decades, Carnall spearheaded the effort to bring more detail to the assignment of lanthanide and actinide energy levels, including neodymium(III), in molten salt eutectics,21,338 doped LaF3 lattices,3,339 and in solution.307,340,341 The experimental data was reported in combination with the state-of-the-art theoretical calculations of the time.
8.2 Observables in optical experiment
The multiplets that are produced from spin–orbit coupling are envelopes that contain the (2J + 1) electronic states, or (2J + 1)/2 Kramers levels. In a crystal field, the states within the multiplet splits from the barycentre of the multiplet. The effect of the crystal field on the properties of the states within the multiplet is characterized by specific descriptors. These descriptors include the multiplet barycentre, multiplet total splitting, line intensity, and band/line width. The energy shift of each spectral line must also be considered when they are resolved. The multiplet barycentre is the energy of the multiplet in the absence of the crystal field. It can be theoretically calculated from the spin–orbit coupling Hamiltonian with free-ion parameters. The states/Kramers levels do not split symmetrically from the degenerate spin–orbit multiplet. This means that the barycentre cannot be experimentally determined from the multiplet band maximum, although this value is sometimes used to describe the multiplet energy with a single value.
8.2.1 Multiplet energy, multiplet splitting and bandwidth. From the multiplet barycentre, the states split in an asymmetric crystal field. The (2J + 1)/2 Kramers levels in a multiplet are isoenergetic in perfect symmetry such as in the free ion as the levels are perturbed equally in their symmetric environment. Because the spatial arrangement of the electronic configurations of the f-orbitals are different, any asymmetric crystal field perturb the states differently and these split in energy. In the hexagonal C3h point group of Nd:LaCl3 the total splitting is no more than 250 cm−1 for the 4I9/2 multiplet, while the same 4I9/2 multiplet is split by 850 cm−1 in the orthorhombic D2(d) symmetry of a Nd:YAG laser material, see Table 7.1,17,342 Overall, the multiplet splitting magnitude in neodymium(III) will be in the order of 500 cm−1 as can be expected for all the 4f-elements as indicated in Table 6. Caution is advised when reporting or comparing multiplet barycenter energies and splitting, and contrasting the actual spectra is advised.

8.2.2 Line intensity. The spectral line intensities indicate transition probabilities as discussed above. Fundamentally, in a spherically symmetric environment, for a non-polarized light source, and an isotropic sample environment transitions from an initial state to any final state in a multiplet occur with identical transition probability. As the symmetry decreases to any non-spherical symmetry, the transition probabilities become different for each transition. This is unsurprising as these difference in transition probability arise from the same perturbations that produce the splitting of the multiplet. This implies that if e.g. the two states of the 4F3/2 multiplet are non-degenerate it cannot be assumed that transition probabilities to and from these states are equivalent.245Despite the fact that the transition probabilities from states in the same multiplet are not equivalent, equivalent line intensities can be assumed if the lines are not resolved. Consider the transitions from a fully degenerate 4F3/2 that terminate on the 4I9/2 multiplet in which 5 Kramers levels are split into 2 levels of double and triple degeneracy. Experimentally, two lines would be observed and here the spectral band with the greatest intensity can most likely be assigned to the triple-degenerate level. If, instead of investigating an isotropic system using unpolarised light, the sample is a single crystal that is probed using polarized light, the individual line intensities can change depending on the sample orientation. This effects of polarization will be discussed below.

8.2.3 Line width. The spectral band and line widths are usually taken as the full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of the band/line. For the Gaussian distribution often seen in solution, the FWHM takes the value of: 
(18)where σ is the standard deviation of the Gaussian profile. If other line shapes are observed, Lorentzian or Voigt functions must be used, see above. Note that care should be taken to investigate if the observed line widths are defined by the sample or by the spectrometer used.
8.2.4 Covalency and the Nephelauxetic effect. When comparing different neodymium(III) systems, the energy of a single line, or of the entire multiplet, can be considered as shifted with respect to each other. This implies a stabilization or destabilization of the electronic energy levels involved in the transitions. This is to be expected, when the coordination environment is changed the electronic structure adapts. The common descriptor associated to this phenomenon for the f-block elements is the nephelauxetic effect.275,343,344 Using the transition energies of aqueous neodymium(III) the β parameter evaluates the average difference in energy of n transitions of the system. 
(19)The value of β is often below unity that is the transition energies of the complex are red-shifted with respect to the aqua complexes of the lanthanide(III) ions. It is observed that the transition energies decrease with an increase in donor strength.275,343,344 Because the energy shift is correlated with ligand donor strength, β has subsequently used as an internal reference for covalency of a complex compared to the neodymium(III) aqua complex. 
(20) 
(21)δ is a measure of covalency in percent345 and b1/2 an estimate of J-mixing compared to neodymium(III) aqua complex.198 Changes in the “hypersensitive” line intensities have also been attributed to effects of covalency and the δ and b1/2 parameters were developed with respect to the “hypersensitive” transition. As we consider the assignment of “hypersensitivity” to be dated, we will not recommend using the nephelauxetic effect to analyse 4f-elements. Viewed through the lens of molecular photophysics, the origin of the observation appears to be convoluted with the difference in ground and excited state equilibrium geometry.
8.3 The energy level diagram
To construct the energy level diagrams, the energy levels must first be measured—either at the multiplet or the electronic state level of resolution. Upon experimental determination of the multiplet/state energy, each electronic energy levels must be labelled according to a theoretical framework. The theoretical framework in use is the Russel-Saunders term symbols, 2S+1LJ, constructed from the electronic configurations of each multiplet. Using Hund's rules, the lowest energy 2S+1LJ term can be predicted including an estimate of the multiplet ordering with respect to J, see Table 1 for the suggested nomenclature.
The energies and ordering of the electronic energy levels cannot be known without experiment, and absorption spectroscopy is the best tool. Here, all transitions occurring from the lowest energy multiplet can be mapped. For neodymium(III), the energy of the highest lying multiplet, 2F(1)5/2, is found around 67000 cm−1 (150 nm). However, many of the bands in the UV are hard to measure because of the extensive lattice/solvent/ligand absorption most materials has above 25000 cm−1 (400 nm).346 Furthermore, conventional broadband light sources have no or limited intensity above 30000 cm−1 (∼330 nm). Thus, only approximately half of the 41 neodymium(III) multiplets are accessible through absorption spectroscopy when using conventional experimental conditions, compare Fig. 3 and 5.
Because of absorption to vibrational overtones of the lattice, similar problems can be seen at low energies, in particular for transitions to the 4IJ multiplets. Nevertheless, these are well established and can readily be determined using emission spectroscopy.
We are not aware of a tutorial review or textbook describing how the excited states are assigned a Russel-Saunders term symbol, and we use the assignment of Carnall when labelling multiplets,3,21,338,339 see Table 7 for an example of energy level values and assignment.
8.4 Convoluted lines
Several effects add to the complexity of optical spectra of lanthanide(III) ions, and these make the spectra difficult to interpret. Each multiplet contain (2J + 1) states, each with a linewidth that range from 5 cm−1 in low temperature solids to 100 cm−1 in liquid media.245,347 Absorption to the 4F5/2 and 2H9/2 multiplets generally overlap, and consist of 8 lines in low symmetry. Here, convolution of lines becomes a significant problem when attempting to assign the specific states of the multiplets. Thermal population of the multiplets further complicates the issue.
The two Kramers doublets of the 4F3/2 multiplet can split up to 100 cm−1, and the Boltzmann distribution dictate a minimum population of 40% in the higher level at ambient temperature.
The 4I9/2 multiplet can split into five Kramers levels that are separated by up to 500 cm−1, which gives a population of the highest level of 8%. Fig. 8 shows a schematic representation of the thermal population of the energy levels experimentally determined in neodymium doped LiYF4 crystals.287
 Fig. 8  Crystal field splitting of the 4F3/2 and 4I9/2 multiplets of neodymium(III) doped into a yttrium aluminium garnet.17 The triangles represent the thermal distribution and the top of the triangle is the energy with 10% Boltzmann population at ambient temperatures (298 K, red), liquid nitrogen (77 K, orange) or liquid helium temperatures (>10 K, blue). 
Through thermal population in the 4F3/2 and 4I9/2 multiplet, the higher lying states in a multiplets emit or absorb with a different wavelength, and this convolutes the spectra. Thus, a band in the spectrum is convoluted of several lines with an intensity that vary as a function of temperature. Fig. 8 shows how this can be exploited to de-convolute the spectra. Liquid nitrogen temperature (77 K) significantly removes the thermal population of the higher states in the 4I9/2 multiplet for absorption experiments in the neodymium(III) doped LiYF4 material. And, liquid helium (<10 K) cooling fully resolves the states of the 4F3/2 multiplet in emission experiments.
Low temperature spectroscopy is a powerful tool, particularly for solid state samples, where the structure is conserved at all temperatures. If a solution is frozen, the lanthanide(III) ion may be locked in a state that is not representative for the dominant structure in solution at ambient temperatures. This is a result of packing effects that force the chemical environment into different configurations. This can be directly monitored as spectral changes as each molecular structure has a specific spectral shape. It is therefore crucial to critically evaluate spectral shapes when interpreting electronic spectra of a frozen solution.
8.5 Sample composition and speciation
The homogeneity of the lanthanide(III) ion site symmetry is an ideal case of sample composition that can only be obtained in the solid state. The labile ligand and solvent coordination at the lanthanide(III) ion in solution often makes the observed spectrum from a liquid sample reflect the most frequently populated coordination geometry. But the spectrum also have contributions from the many lesser populated coordination geometries. In the best case this leads to Gaussian broadening of bands as they consist of sets of lines from each species in solution. In the worst case the spectra will be a composite of spectra from species of different constitution.
The 2P1/2 and 4D1/2 multiplets of neodymium(III) should be a single line arising from single Kramers levels. These can therefore be used to investigate sample homogeneity. If the sample is frozen to a temperature where only the lowest state of the 4I9/2 level is populated, absorption to either the 2P1/2 or 4D1/2 multiplets must be a single line for samples containing only a single neodymium(III) species. Consequently, the sample homogeneity can be confirmed if only a single line is observed for these transitions. For a heterogeneous sample, the number of neodymium(III) species will be proportional to the number of lines observed for the 2P1/2 ← 4I9/2 transition. This method serves as a qualitative inquiry of the sample heterogeneity similar to what is used for the 5D0 ↔ 7F0 transitions in europium(III).31,181,262
8.6 Higher-lying energy levels
In standard spectroscopic setups the accessible energy range lie between 400–900 nm (25000–11000 cm−1). To access higher-lying energy levels upconversion spectroscopy is generally employed. In the upconversion experiments a neodymium(III) ion is excited by a laser into an accessible multiplet that exhibit high absorption, such as the [4F5/2, 2H9/2] band. The excited state relax into the long-lived 4F3/2 multiplet from which two different processes can lead to upconversion for neodymium(III), see Fig. 9.142,143,157,308,348,349
 Fig. 9  Left: Emission from the 4G7/2 (540 nm) and 2P1/2 (430 nm) multiplets obtained through upconversion mechanisms. Right: Mechanisms of upconversion that may occur either through energy transfer upconversion (ETU) between two neodymium(III) ions, or by excited state absorption (ESA) with a secondary excitation photon. Adapted from Balda Phys. Rev. 2001.142 
In the first case, the neodymium(III) ion absorbs a second photon, either from the same excitation source or from a secondary laser (if a different wavelength is required). This mechanism is referred to as excited state absorption (ESA). Another mechanism is energy transfer upconversion (ETU). This mechanism occurs if two neodymium(III) ions are excited to the 4F3/2 level simultaneously. This allows the excited states to couple and form a higher lying state at one of the ions, and a ground state at the other ion. The two transitions 4G7/2 ← 4F3/2 and 4F3/2 → 4I13/2 are isoenergetic (∼7500 cm−1) and can form a excitated 4G7/2 multiplet in combination with a 4I13/2 multiplet.
The ESA and ETU mechanisms both result in emission from the 4G7/2 multiplet, but due to the higher secondary excitation energy of the ESA mechanism, it is also possible to observe emission from the 2P1/2 multiplet via ESA.
The prerequisite for observing emission does not change for the higher-lying energy levels: the radiative rate krad must be competitive when compared to the non-radiative rates knr and kq for each multiplet in the neodymium(III) ion. Therefore, the upconversion experiments are most suitable for solid samples with only low-energy phonons. It has been suggested that the threshold for observing luminescence require an energy gap below the emitting level equal to or larger than four phonon quanta.204 From Table 7, the gap below the 4G7/2 is estimated at 2500 cm−1 and would require phonon energy of about 625 cm−1. For the 2P1/2 multiplet the energy gap is approximated at 1500 cm−1 and the phonon threshold 375 cm−1.
Emission from the higher energy levels in neodymium(III) can also be accessed by excitation into the 185 nm (54000 cm−1) 4f25d1 configuration, which can relax back into the 4f3 configurations. This has been achieved with upconversion in transient absorption using e.g. a 350 nm laser and directly using 185 nm synchrotron radiation.204,350–352 Via this pathway, the 215 nm (46500 cm−1) 2G9/2 multiplet can be populated and give observable luminescence in the 300–950 nm range. With the mapping of the 2G9/2 multiplet, only the 2G7/2 and 2F5/2 multiplets remain experimentally uncharted.
In relation to higher states with significant thermal population, the 4F5/2 multiplet, ∼1000 cm−1 above the 4F3/2 level, is thermally populated with just under 1% of the 4F5/2 population at ambient temperatures. Emission bands representing the 4F5/2 → 4IJ transitions have become more accessible with improvements to NIR detector sensitivities and have seen use in optical thermometers.122,353
8.7 Polarization
With standard experimental conditions the determination of coordination geometry of neodymium(III) revolves around the number of observable lines and the magnitude of their splitting. Here, the main difficulty is the identification of specific lines. With polarized light it is possible to resolve the individual lines in convoluted bands. The spatial extend of each state involved in a transition in relation to the directionality of the electric and magnetic field vectors of the photon becomes important. This creates a photoselection of specific orientation of the ions in the sample that is polarization effects come into effect.
In isotropic samples such as powders and solutions, the directionality is unimportant and unpolarized light can be used without loss of information. In single crystals, the neodymium(III) ions can have a shared optical axis that couple differently with the incoming light depending on the polarization i.e. direction of the electric  and magnetic  field vectors.354 The optical axis often coincides with the crystallographic c-axis, but this is not certain. In cubic symmetry, these effects cancel out because the crystallographic directions are equivalent, [a = b = c]. In axial symmetries where [a = b ≠ c], the sample orientation allows for three different orientation denoted as α = (⊥c, ⊥c), σ = (⊥c, ‖c), and π = (‖c, ⊥c) spectra. For symmetries where [a ≠ b ≠ c] the axes are simply denoted as X, Y and Z. The symmetry of each state is labelled with irreducible representations of symmetry, most often in the Γi notation in lanthanide(III) spectroscopy.355 Fig. 10 shows an example of the three different polarization orientations for a sample of LiYF4 doped with neodymium(III) at an axial S4 symmetry site.191 The directional dependency means that the selection rules for ED, EQ and MD transitions can be further broken down for each polarization as is shown in Table 8 for the same axial sample.

Where unpolarized, variable temperature, and high-resolution spectroscopy need theoretical corroborations to assign state to spectral lines, polarized spectroscopy allows this assignment with much less theoretical support. In addition, the directional dependency allows for deconvolution of transitions that are allowed in different sample orientations.
Next, the advantage of studying high-symmetry complexes will be explained. However, the requirement for inequivalent optical axes makes polarized spectroscopy a valuable tool even for samples with only limited symmetry.166,356,357 Magnetic Circular Dichroism (MCD) is not covered here.358,359
9 Parametrization of luminescence spectra
Theoretical predictions are important even for experimental lanthanide(III) spectroscopy. A good theoretical model that fit the experimental data indicates a good understanding of the physical phenomena behind the observations, and provide predictive power for similar systems. Consequently, discrepancies between data and model can highlight areas where the theoretical framework is lacking.
Energy level calculations consist of free-ion parameters, where electronic repulsion and spin–orbit coupling of the valence electrons act as the primary perturbations, see Fig. 4 above. The barycenter of the 2S+1LJ multiplets are, assuming that the spin–orbit coupling is described by the 20 free ion parameters, unaffected by the crystal field and are thus only included in a fitting procedure if adjustments in the multiplet barycenters are necessary.
In the framework of crystal field theory, the crystal field Hamiltonian describe the splitting of the states within a multiplet:354,360 
(22)Here, the Bka parameter is known as the Wybourne parameter. These contain information on the crystal field potential of interest to the energy level calculations. The Ckq parameter is a spherical tensor operator evaluated from expressions of the spherical harmonics. The indices k and q take values of k = 0 … 2l and q = m − m′. The parameters evaluated at odd k can be omitted because the spherical harmonic terms cancel out. In total this amounts to 28 crystal field parameters that has to be included in the energy level calculations for the f-orbitals. An elaborate description of the crystal field parametrization is outside the scope of this review, but a few choice comments must be made in context of experimental data. With 28 crystal field parameters, any attempt at fitting the energy levels will be susceptive to overfitting.
Theoreticians agree that the B00 parameter globally affect the energy of all states in the 4f3 configuration, although this effect is often absorbed into the free-ion calculations. Additional parameters can be left out through a correct choice of the basis used the calculations, whereby certain Bka terms cancel out. At this point, the theoretician must rely on the experimentalists to manufacture high-symmetry complexes where certain Bka terms indeed vanish thereby simplifying ĤCF. Similar to the expected number of observable lines, the number of Bka parameters are reduced as a function of symmetry, see Table 9.

At the current level of theory, calculations of energy level structure and transition intensities can assist the identification of transitions by attributing a best guess for the energy level ordering, and by indicating relative intensities of transitions that would otherwise be interchangeable. This has been done for other lanthanide(III) ions, but we are not aware of examples for neodymium(III).
9.1 Semi-empirical description of transition probabilities: Judd–Ofelt theory
The parametrization of optical spectra of lanthanide(III) ions has historically been done using the phenomenological Judd–Ofelt intensity parameters. These are widely used due to simplicity, and the number of experimentally parameters that are reported. Judd–Ofelt provides numbers that can be used to predict spectral line intensities, radiative lifetimes, quantum yields, transition cross-sections, and branching ratios This is done by fitting spectral data to three parameters, Ωλ=2,4,6.361,362
Within the d-block, crystal field theory and ab initio calculations have become instrumental and able to predict energy level structure for transition metal complexes.364–369 With the added intricacy of the seven valence orbitals, in combination with contributions from relativistic effects and the lack of directional bonding, the same treatments is more difficult for the lanthanide(III) ions.
As ab initio methods describing the lanthanide(III) excited states are only emerging, the Judd–Ofelt theory from 1962 was an attempt to adapt crystal field theory to the f-elements by describing unexpected 4f–4f transition intensities by introducing admixture of 5d orbital with even (gerade) parity.370,371 Here, the structure of the Judd–Ofelt treatment will be outlined but for a greater understanding the reader is referred to extensive reviews on this subject.361,362
The Judd–Ofelt treatment calculate f for (induced) ED transitions of lanthanide(III) ions (eqn (23)). Consequently, radiative rate constants can also be derived: 
(23) 
(24)where me is the mass of the electron, h is Planck's constant, ṽ the mean transition wavenumber, χabsED a local-field correction, (2J + 1) the degeneracy of the initial multiplet, ε0 the permittivity of vacuum, e the elementary charge and n the refractive index. The squared brackets are reduced matrix elements between the states φi and φf. Uλ are tensor operators and are described as being invariant with the chemical environment and the values are usually transferred/inferred from previously determined values.307 This leaves Ωλ=2,4,6 as three variable parameters derived from a least-squares fit of the spectral data, under restrictions set by the assumed point group symmetry of the environment. With this treatment, the features of all spectral intensities are contained within just three parameters that can achieve small standard deviations for data sets that cover a wide range of energies. This comparatively small parameter space and relative ease of use have made the Judd–Ofelt treatment widely applied in lanthanide(III) spectroscopy, yet the theory have some drawbacks as it is built on a series of major assumptions.
First, in the derivation of the Judd–Ofelt theory it is assumed that the initial φi and final φf states involved in any transition are isoenergetic and therefore the same distance from the admixed 4f25d1 configuration. If we consider the neodymium(III) ground state and the often-used 4G5/2 level, the energy difference to the 5d configurations for these two levels is about 55000 cm−1 for the [4f25d1] ↔ 4I9/2 transition and 38000 cm−1 for the [4f25d1] ↔4G5/2 transition. This represent a 44% higher energy gap for the 4I9/2 ground state compared to the gap to the 4G5/2 level.
Second, the theory demand that all states in a multiplet are completely degenerate and equally populated. Based on the crystal field discussion above, it is clear that this is not the case for any neodymium(III) level, where the separation magnitude between states can be up to 800 cm−1 (Table 7) and with considerable variability in population of each state depending on temperature.
Third, it is proclaimed—both in Judd–Ofelt formalism and throughout the lanthanide luminescence literature—that MD transition probabilities are independent of crystal field. Thus, calculating f of MD transitions omits the intensity parameters Ωλ and reduces to: 
(25)The |L + gS| operator is a purely angular momentum based operator where g is the electron g-factor. The environmental invariability is the foundation for using integrated MD transition probabilities as internal standards when deriving photophysical parameters of lanthanide(III) ions.296,372–374 However, it has been proven that this is not true.181 MD transitions are not typically of interest in neodymium(III) spectroscopy.
The fourth and final issue with using Judd–Ofelt theory is the physical meaning assigned to the three Ωλ parameters. It is clear that each parameter behave differently. The Ω2 parameter exhibit a clear correlation with crystal field asymmetry, but also with what is often associated to covalency of the donor atoms and quadrupole strength.132,275,279,280,375,376 In a few cases the Ω2 parameter has also been associated to polarizability.374,377 Note that “hypersensitivity” is also assigned to these observations and there is an intimate relationship between “hypersensitivity” and the Ω2 parameter. The Ω4 and Ω6 parameters are even more elusive and the best attempt at describing their behavior is ligand rigidity, and potentially long range effects in bulk materials.171,285,375,377–379 An interesting observation of the Ω4 and Ω6 magnitudes in neodymium(III) ions is that the emission branching ratios from the 4F3/2 multiplet to the four 4IJ multiplets can be determined solely from the Ω4/Ω6 ratio.113–116,380 Although this is an effect of the squared reduced matrix elements, it can be simplified in terms of the intensity ratio of the 4F3/2 → 4I9/2 (880 nm) and the 4F3/2→ 4I11/2 (1050 nm) band. By minimizing the ratio, the branching ratio will favour the transition to the 4I11/2 level, and as this transition is important for neodymium(III) lasers, the ratio has come to be known as the spectroscopic quality factor.328
The Judd–Ofelt treatment has problems as it is based on some drastic assumptions. Further, the theory lacks physical interpretation of the intensity parameters and is unable to provide predictive capabilities that is Judd–Ofelt theory does not allow properties to be predicted based on structure.
In contrast, the developments in ab initio calculations encourage the use of state-of-the-art calculation tools, all more strongly founded in a physical framework. In particular the performance of the CASSCF package for the ORCA software and Molcas are producing promising predictions for lanthanide(III) systems.35,192,193,241,381–388
10 Neodymium(III) spectroscopy in action
With careful sample preparation and measurements, optical spectra can be assigned to specific lanthanide(III) species. The key point is that the species studied must be known, before the observed property can be assigned to the molecular structure. Fortunately, optical spectroscopy is a useful tool for monitoring the formation of certain species as a function of ligand concentration, determining speciation, and monitoring changes due to e.g. ionic strength and pH.48,94 And as the aqueous spectra of many neosymium(III) salts are well-documented in the literature, these can be a suitable starting points for titrations to investigate various solution species. Alternatively, the speciation can be controlled more directly by forming complexes of polydentate ligands such as trans-1,2-diaminocyclohexanetetraacetic acid (CDTA, CN = 6), 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7-triacetic (DO3A, CN = 7) or diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA, CN = 8).94,389 Complexes of ligands like these are fairly kinetically and very thermodynamically stable, and can be studied in detail in solution.94,390
Locking down Neodymium(III) speciation, determination of molecular structure, and the determination of the neodymium(III) electronic energy levels induced by the specific crystal field is the next step. This includes the development of tools to determine these effortlessly in both the solids and in solution. In the following, we have selected the examples from literature, where a specific form of optical spectroscopy or property of neodymium(III) is discussed.
10.1 Examples from the solid state
Here we focus on data from solid samples studied at liquid helium temperature using advanced spectroscopy. In the solid it is easy to record high resolution spectra and correlate the results with structural information from X-ray diffraction experiments.
10.1.1 Polarised spectroscopy. Sodium β′′ alumina (SBA) was first investigated due to high ionic conductivity, and it later showed promise as a laser material.357,391–394 It is possible to exchange the small and mobile monovalent sodium ions in this material with the larger trivalent rare earth ions. The rare earth ions also display some degree of mobility in the conductive plane of the SBA materials, and by exchanging with the optically active neodymium(III) ions, spectroscopy could be used to characterize the stationary sites of the material.The investigations of the neodymium(III) doped SBA material culminated with a paper by Dai and Stafsudd. They carefully measured spectra of the material using σ and π polarization at 9 K, where thermal population distribution in the ground state multiplet is avoided (Fig. 8).301 This measurement revealed two lines arising from the 2P1/2 ← 4I9/2 transition. Fig. 11 show the two lines at 428 nm and 430 nm, which clearly document that two neodymium(III) sites must be present in the material. Aided by X-ray scattering data, the two sites could be assigned to one with a C3v site symmetry and one with a C2h site symmetry.395 Using polarized spectroscopy, each spectral lines was assigned to a site in the crystalline material. The 430 nm line could be observed in both σ and π polarizations. This is only possible for a low symmetry site, where polarization is inactive. Thus, the line at 430 nm must be from neodymium(III) ions in a site with C2h symmetry. The line at 428 nm could only be observed with π polarization indicating higher site symmetry. Thus, the 428 nm line must be from neodymium(III) ions in a site with C3v symmetry.
 Fig. 11  Polarized absorption spectra of neodymium(III) doped in a two-site sodium β′′ alumina structure at 9 K. Top: The 2P1/2 ← 4I9/2 transition. Bottom: The 4F3/2 ← 4I9/2 transition. Spectral lines that are present in both correspond to low symmetry or non-polarizable site, while spectral lines that are only present in one polarization indicate a polarized site of higher symmetry. Adapted from Dai and Stafsudd 1991.301 
Fig. 11 shows that similar polarisation effects were observed in the 4F3/2 ← 4I9/2 band. The crystal field of the C2h site produce a neodymium(III) line at 883 nm that was seen for both polarizations. Two other lines was at 872 nm and 858 nm at σ and π polarization, respectively. As they were seen in opposite polarization, they must originate from neodymium(III) ions in the C3v site.
The investigation of the uniaxial SBA material included an expansion of the Judd–Ofelt theory. The Judd–Ofelt theory was originally developed in an isotropic framework incapable of handling anisotropic oscillator strengths. However, it was found that the intensity parameter Ωλ could be decomposed into two polarizability-dependant parameters Ωλσ and Ωλπ. These make up the total effective intensity parameter Ωeffλ = Ωσ + 2Ωπ. The new Judd–Ofelt intensity parameters can thus be used for uniaxial optical systems, but illustrated a peculiar behaviour. Although the Ωeff2 parameters depend almost exclusively on the “hypersensitive” 4G5/2 ← 4I9/2 transition intensity, the model could not accurately fit the experimental data even when the intensity terms were allowed complete freedom. The “hypersensitive” transition had to be omitted from the experimental data in order to obtain a good fit. This result illustrates that the fitting of the Ω2 parameter magnitude is not feasible using Judd–Ofelt theory and would suggest that Ω2 is defined in a manner that makes it overly sensitive to “hypersensitive” transition features and comparatively insensitive to non-hypersensitive transitions.
This example illustrates the power of polarised spectroscopy, showcases the usefulness of the 2P1/2 ← 4I9/2 transition, and highlights the issues of using Judd–Ofelt theory to characterise neodymium(III) luminescence.

10.1.2 High energy excitation. To obtain energy parameters of good quality, high resolution spectroscopy coupled with a sample with high neodymium(III) site symmetry is ideal. The cubic symmetries common for transition metal coordination chemistry are rare for the lanthanide(III) ions. Therefore, the elpasolite structures M2BYX6, containing i.e. M = Cs+, Rb+; B = Na+, K+; X = F−, Cl−, are interesting as the lanthanide(III) ion retain octahedral Oh symmetry. This is ideal for crystal field parametrization.202,230–232,298,396 In Oh symmetry, the crystal field parameters needed to describe the crystal field are reduced to two parameters: B04 and B06. It should be noted that the many free-ion parameters are fitted simultaneously with the two crystal field parameters. With only two crystal field parameters, the degeneracy of the multiplets are conserved to a significant extent. The elpasolite structures are also characterized by low phonon energies <500 cm−1. Thereby, higher lying emissive states such as 4G7/2, 4D3/2 (18640 cm−1, 27617 cm−1) are enabled at low temperatures, when the sample is addressed with excitation in the near UV (355 nm, 28200 cm−1). Data from this type of experiments in the form of emission spectra are shown in Fig. 12. Further, far-UV excitation sources (185 nm) accessible at synchrotron light sources, can give emission from the 2G(2)9/2 (57560 cm−1) level.
 Fig. 12  High resolution emission (top) and absorption (bottom) spectra of neodymium(III) ions occupying an Oh sites in the Cs2NaNdCl6 elpasolite structure. In such high symmetries, electronic transitions, Γn, primarily occur via vibrational coupling, Γn + Sm. Adapted from Zhou, Faucher and Tanner 2006.397 
In Oh symmetry the central ion is in a centrosymmetric site, which decrease the transition probabilities between all states. In such high symmetries, phonon-coupled transitions are the most intense spectral lines. In high resolution spectroscopy, individual states can thus be assigned by the symmetry of their electronic configuration in the form of irreducible representation εΓn. This is also called the zero-phonon line (ZPL). Phonon-coupled transitions can also be identified through the coupling to specific lattice vibrational modes Sm. In phonon active materials such as elpasolites, there are many phonon coupled lines εΓn + Sm, which clutter the spectrum. However, at 10 K the spectral line widths are small and the convolution εΓn + Sm is for the most part not a problem in the assignment process. Instead, the presence of Sm facilitates the interpretation of the spectrum. Thus, the vibronic effects on the central neodymium(III) ion can be used as an alternative to polarized spectroscopy in assigning the spectra.
This example show that the displacements in a solid material due to phonons can be used to investigate the electronic structure of lanthanide(III) ions. Here, high energy excitation to higher lying emissive state, in combination with cryogenic measurements and high (Oh) symmetry was used to assign the energy level structure with high certainty.233,397

10.1.3 Luminescence thermometry. The laser community is a driving force for exploring the spectroscopic properties of neodymium(III). One application of modern lasers is contactless luminescence thermometry.398 Thermometry involves the study of thermally populated levels. For neodymium(III) this includes the population of the 4F5/2 multiplet (800 nm, 12,450 cm−1)—and occasionally the 4F7/2 (750 nm, 13400 cm−1) multiplet—that can be thermally populated from the 4F3/2 primary emissive multiplet (880 nm, 11400 cm−1) and luminesce into the 4IJ levels.399–401In this example, neodymium(III) luminescence thermometry was achieved in a GTSN:Nd material (GeO2–TeO2–SrF2–Nb2O5–Nd2O3). The glass was studied in the temperature range 300–725 K. In this temperature range, the 4F5/2 multiplet, roughly 1000 cm−1 above the 4F3/2 multiplet, would have a population increase from 0.8% at 300 K to 12% at 725 K.122 For the 4F7/2 multiplet, these values are 0.0% to 1.9%, respectively.
By monitoring the thermally induced emission from the 4F5/2 and 4F7/2 multiplets, see Fig. 13, a ratiometric relationship was established between I[4F5/2 → 4IJ]/I[4F3/2 → 4IJ] and I[4F7/2 → 4IJ]/I[4F3/2 → 4IJ] and the temperature. The Fluorescence Intensity Ratio (FIR) was then used to evaluate temperature in the GTSN:Nd structure using the following relation: 
(26)Here, ΔE the difference in energy of considered levels (cf. Boltzmann distribution), while A and B are experimentally derived parameters.
 Fig. 13  (a) Neodymium(III) emission intensity of the 4F3/2 → 4I11/2 transition as function of temperature from 300–675 K of GTSN:Nd at 0.5% doping and λex = 586 nm showing the thermal population of the 4F5/2 and 4F7/2 multiplets. (b–d) Different measures of the responses to temperature. Adapted from Lukaszewicz and Lisiecki.122 
This study is an interesting example of how material science allows interesting photophysical phenomena to be investigated in neodymium(III) doped materials. To conduct the FIR analysis, photophysical parameters of the laser was required. Here the Füchtbauer–Ladenburg relation was used to derive emission cross sections σem(λ) and Judd–Ofelt theory was used to derive the phenomological Ωλ=2,4,6 parameters that combined provided the laser intensity parameters. In addition to the FIR analysis, the Ωλ magnitudes were also used for determining the spectroscopic quality factor developed by Lomheim and DeShazer.116
With FIR analysis, and by using the σem(λ) and Ωλ=2,4,6 parameters, it was possible to obtain a thermal resolution of ΔT = 0.18 K derived from the FIR calculated from the I[4F5/2 → 4I11/2]/I[4F3/2 → 4I11/2] ratio.
This example illustrates the use of the Judd–Ofelt parameters in parameterization and that the theory still finds applicability for laser intensity and performance benchmarking.

10.2 Examples from solution
Neodymium(III) spectroscopy in solution is both complicated and underdeveloped when compared to the solid state. Nevertheless, it is vital to understand the solution phase chemistry to improve on the important processes of neodymium(III) and lanthanide(III) extraction and separation. In solution, we are unable to achieve high resolution spectra, and structural characterization remains difficult. The solution phase is a dynamic chemical environment, and it is essential to understand the chemistry of the possible neodymium(III) species that can contribute to the observed spectra.
10.2.1 Determining speciation. In solution, the individual spectral lines are often not resolved. Line broadening from structural fluctuation makes it difficult to accurately assess multiplet splitting, especially in the cases where it is uncertain if two spectral lines are degenerate or they are non-degenerate, but so close in energy that the data show them as degenerate. This type of convolution can only be improved by going down in temperature, and requires that solid solutions or glasses can be formed.Another type of convolution that gives rise to bands instead of lines, is if the sample contains multiple interconverting neodymium(III) species. This can be resolved, and the molar fraction of each species and their distinct spectral fingerprint can be determined using spectrophotometric titrations. The same methodology can also be used to determine the degree of protonation of ligands, stepwise complexation of small ligands, and the coordination of polydentate chelators. With the speciation determined, photophysical parameters such as multiplet position and splitting can be assigned to each chemical species.32,35,180,181 Thus both photophysical and thermodynamic parameters can be determined from the best of these experiments, although it is often either/or. Both types of information are important to increase our understanding of neodymium(III) and lanthanide(III) solution chemistry.
In the field of hydrometallurgical chemistry, chemical knowledge of lanthanide(III) coordination is essential for design of holdback complexes and extracting agents. In a series of papers by Zalupski, stability constants of complex formation where determined for DTPA and EDTA and their derivatives for lanthanide(III) and actinide(III) ions using spectrophotometric titrations.95,265,389,402,403 Potentiometric titrations and various methods including radioisotope distribution, computational microcalorimetry, and luminescence lifetime determination were used to support the spectrophotometric titrations. Stability constants were derived from titrations and speciation was calculated. This provided the molar fractions of chemical species present at each point of titration.
Hydrometallurgy motivates much of the work on neodymium(III), and an example using neodymium(III) spectroscopy is illustrated in Fig. 14. Here, titration with the DTPA derivative DTTA-BuA was used to resolve the neodymium(III) speciation. The key to determining the distribution of species is the ability to deconvolute and isolate the spectral profile of a chemical species.
 Fig. 14  Left: Spectroscopic titration series showing neodymium(III) absorption under complexation with DTTA-BuA in aqueous solution at ambient temperatures. Right: Deconvoluted absorption spectra of the hydrated neodymium(III) species and in complexes of DTTA-BuA at different protonation degrees. Adapted from Heathman 2018.95 
This example shows that with deconvolution, each chemical species can be associated with an optical fingerprint to which photophysical parameters can be assigned.181 Note that a protonated form of the complex was identified. Speciation derived from titration is not a novel concept but its usage in lanthanide(III) chemistry and spectroscopy is currently not very widespread.

10.2.2 The first Nd(III) luminescence lifetimes. As neodymium(III) exhibit multiple strong absorption bands in the visible range, spectrophotometric titrations of neodymium(III) are most often recorded using absorption spectroscopy. Even so, luminescence is often favoured as it is a strong tool for characterization of lanthanide(III) ions. Due to the long radiative lifetimes and large pseudo-Stokes shifts, time-gated luminescence spectroscopy provides easy access to information via emission spectra that for neodymium(III) is shifted into the NIR region. Due to the small band gap of the emissive 4F3/2 multiplet, fast quenching processes are active in most media, and NIR luminescence from neodymium(III) remains elusive in solution at ambient temperatures, in particular in aqueous solution.Luminescence of neodymium(III) in solution did not become relevant until the late 1990ies due to the extensive excited state quenching of neodymium(III) that occurs in solution. In 1997 the first luminescence lifetimes were determined for neodymium(III) in simple solvents: H2O, MeOH and DMSO and their deuterated counterparts, it was also determined for complexes of the common chelators: NTA, EDTA, DTPA and 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclodecane-1,4,7,10-tetrayl-(methylenebenzene-phospinic acid).266,297
These examples illustrated that the field was ready for neodymium(III) solution luminescence, and how solution experiments helped to introduce the differential quenching efficiencies for deuterated versus non-deuterated solvents already extensively studies for other lanthanide(III) ions.318,332,404

10.2.3 ‘High’ intensity Nd(III) luminescence. At the same time as the neodymium(III) lifetimes in simple solvents were determined, advanced coordination compounds were developed in order to maximize the neodymium(III) emission efficiency for liquid media laser materials.131,132,266,269,322–325 In these, high-energy C–H and O–H oscillators were completely removed in various β-diketonate derivatives by exchanging protons with deuterium or fluorine, see Fig. 15. This work is reviewed elsewhere,131 and ref. 131 can be used as a tutorial on the important factors when designing ligands for neodymium(III) complexes with high luminescence quantum yields.
 Fig. 15  Top: Structure of Nd(HFA-D)3, a severely deuterated and fluorinated species of neodymium(III) with low energy vibrational oscillators. Bottom: Excited state lifetimes of Nd(HFA-D)3 in various deuterated solvents. (a) DMSO-d6 (b) DMF-d7 (c) THF-d8 (d) acetone-d6, and (e) methanol-d4 producing lifetimes of 0.70 to 6.30 μs. Adapted from Yanagida 1998.131 
The two complexes that achieved the longest lifetimes and highest quantum yields of luminescence in this work were: Nd(HFA-D)3 with τobs = 6.3 μs and Φ = 1.3%, and Nd(POM-D)3 with τobs = 14.5 μs and Φ = 3.2%. Note that these values are in DMSO-d6. The high numbers were achieved by considering the sources of quenching by vibrational modes in the immediate environment of the neodymium(III) ion.
The authors moves on to test what the effect on the neodymium(III) luminescence intensity is when cross-relaxation via excitation migration and quenching to vibrational modes is removed, and when the asymmetric coordination symmetries are used to relax the established selection rules. The result: highly emissive neodymium(III) complexes.
The underlying concepts explored in this example contributed significantly to our understanding of the photophysical properties of neodymium(III). However, due to the nature of the complexes, their use are very limited. Here, antenna-functionalized complexes are more versatile, and can achieve long lifetimes and high quantum yields even in aqueous solution.131,260 We refer the reader to the detailed accounts describing how to design and use antenna appended lanthanide(III) complexes.5,6,10,182,405–407

11 Summary and conclusion
Neodymium is an essential element for modern society, and as it is refined using solution processes, we need a better understanding of neodymium(III) solution chemistry to make neodymium-based materials readily available to all. In this review, we hope to have made optical spectroscopy more accessible as a tool for creating this understanding.
Lanthanide luminescence—and by extension neodymium(III) photophysics—has evolved separately from molecular photophysics on both the experimental and theoretical side. In this review, we decided to merge the field of lanthanide luminescence with the strong and established field of molecular photophysics. This requires adopting unifying concepts like oscillator strength and the Einstein coefficients. And it requires that we stop using the special exceptions and specialised theoretical models, and that specialized terms such as “hypersensitivity” are abandoned. But most importantly it requires that each and every electronic energy level in the Russel-Saunders multiplets are recognized as a distinct electronic states. Here, we advocate adhering to conservation of energy and conservation of momentum. And we suggest that by accepting that all intraconfigurational f–f transition are forbidden, we gain a foundation on which we can build new knowledge.
While we are able to describe the lowest energy multiplets of most lanthanide(III) containing systems, we struggle to describe the electronic structure of the higher lying electronic energy levels. Nevertheless, we have excellent semi-empirical and purely empirical guidelines that can help us achieve a desired property in a neodymium(III) complex.
This review includes only few examples from the literature, selected among the few studies that include high quality data. Access to the data behind the older literature is a large barrier in this field. If we are to solve the mystery of the electronic structure of lanthanide(III) ions, if we are to achieve predictive capabilities in this part of the periodic table, we need high quality data recorded and reported in a standardised fashion. We suggest using the standards from molecular photophysics.

Patrick R. Nawrocki	Patrick R. Nawrocki graduated with a MSc degree in nanoscience from the University of Copenhagen in 2019, and moved on to do a PhD in chemistry at the same University. In his PhD Patrick focused lanthanide luminescence and experimental photophysics, topics on which he has co-authored more than 12 papers. Patrick was awarded the PhD degree in 2022 and has moved on to take a scientist position in industry.
Thomas Just Sørensen	Professor Thomas Just Sørensen obtained his PhD from the University of Copenhagen in 2010 working on fluorescent dyes with Prof. Bo W. Laursen. After research stays with Prof. Stephen Faulkner at Oxford, Sir J. Fraser Stoddard at UCLA, Prof. Jerome Lacour in Geneva, and Profs Ignacy and Karol Gryczynski at UNT in Fort Worth he returned to take a permanent position at the University of Copenhagen in 2014. Thomas is an entrepreneurial scientist with several start-up companies. His research focuses on lanthanide chemistry in solution and chemical sensors.

 	Fig. 1  Schematic representation of a Rhône-Poulenc liquid–liquid extraction setup. (a) The pathway of the REE passing from the metal rich magnet waste from which a loaded aqueous solution is formed with the addition of strong acidic solution. To pass into the organic phase, the REE must undergo complexation in the critical water–oil interface in the emulsion. (b) Simple mixer-settler layout with a loaded aqueous and non-loaded organic phase, which is agitated to form an emulsion. The emulsion subsequently settles and the two phases separate with a now loaded organic phase. (c) Individual mixer-settler units can be brought together in serial configurations. (d) The transport of neodymium(III) from the aqueous phase to the organic phase must go through the interphase. Neodymium(III) forms multiple different complexes each characterized by distinctly different crystal fields.	 

 	Fig. 2  Ideal polyhedra, Tricapped Trigonal Prism (TTP) and capped Square Anti Prism, that are most favourable for coordination number = 9 cf. the Thomson problem. The TTP structure is the typical molecular structure for lanthanide(III) triflate or perchlorate salts of the first half of the 4f series dissolved in water at neutral pH and in methanol. The cSAP is encountered for ligands that introduce steric interactions in the coordination sphere of the lanthanide(III) ion.

 	Fig. 4  Diagram showing the dominating perturbation effects of the 364 possible 4f configurations of neodymium(III). The atomic (free ion) levels of neodymium(III) produce 364 isoenergetic electronic states (ĤA) and represent the energetic barycenter. These are split by coulombic interactions with other electrons (ĤC), and by coupling of the of the spin and orbital angular momenta (ĤSO). The crystal field act as a perturbation on the 41 spin–orbit multiplets and splits the 2J + 1 degenerate states within each multiplet into the individual mJ or crystal field levels (ĤCF).	 

 	Fig. 5  Energy level diagram showing the most typical absorption and emission bands of neodymium(III). The vertical spectra on the right of the diagram represent the absorption (purple shading) and emission (red shading) of neodymium(III) with tris-dipicolinate in aqueous solution. The 4F3/2 → 4I15/2 (1800 nm) transition is difficult to observe.

 	Fig. 8  Crystal field splitting of the 4F3/2 and 4I9/2 multiplets of neodymium(III) doped into a yttrium aluminium garnet.17 The triangles represent the thermal distribution and the top of the triangle is the energy with 10% Boltzmann population at ambient temperatures (298 K, red), liquid nitrogen (77 K, orange) or liquid helium temperatures (>10 K, blue).	 

 	Fig. 9  Left: Emission from the 4G7/2 (540 nm) and 2P1/2 (430 nm) multiplets obtained through upconversion mechanisms. Right: Mechanisms of upconversion that may occur either through energy transfer upconversion (ETU) between two neodymium(III) ions, or by excited state absorption (ESA) with a secondary excitation photon. Adapted from Balda Phys. Rev. 2001.142	 

 	Fig. 10  Polarization absorption spectra of Nd:LiYF4 (left) at 4.2 K and at (right) 150 K where the higher states in the 4I9/2 ground state multiplet becomes thermally populated and polarization active. Adapted from Leebeeck 1999.191

 	Fig. 11  Polarized absorption spectra of neodymium(III) doped in a two-site sodium β′′ alumina structure at 9 K. Top: The 2P1/2 ← 4I9/2 transition. Bottom: The 4F3/2 ← 4I9/2 transition. Spectral lines that are present in both correspond to low symmetry or non-polarizable site, while spectral lines that are only present in one polarization indicate a polarized site of higher symmetry. Adapted from Dai and Stafsudd 1991.301	 

 	Fig. 12  High resolution emission (top) and absorption (bottom) spectra of neodymium(III) ions occupying an Oh sites in the Cs2NaNdCl6 elpasolite structure. In such high symmetries, electronic transitions, Γn, primarily occur via vibrational coupling, Γn + Sm. Adapted from Zhou, Faucher and Tanner 2006.397
