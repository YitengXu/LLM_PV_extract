In addition to the perovskite absorber component, the adjacent layers within the stack play decisive roles in the stability and overall power conversion efficiency (PCE) of a device. In this study, we demonstrated the use of a solution-processed aluminium indium (AlIn)-TiO2 compact layer as a highly effective electron transport layer (ETL) to achieve outstanding performance of perovskite solar cells; our results showed that the incorporation of AlIn into the TiO2 layer allowed better energy band alignment of the ETL-perovskite interface, improved the transparency, and enhanced the conductivity as compared to the case of pristine TiO2. Via co-doping these trivalent metals, an enhancement in voltage, current density, and even fill factor was observed. In addition, the results obtained from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) revealed that the AlIn-TiO2-based device exhibited larger recombination resistance, which significantly benefited the performance of the devices. As a result, the optimized AlIn-TiO2 ETL device attained the surpassing PCE of 19% as compared to the pristine TiO2 solar device having the PCE of 16.67%.
1. Introduction
In recent years, organic–inorganic halide perovskite materials have been extensively studied owing to their potential applications in solar cells, light-emitting diodes, sensors, photodetectors, field-effect transistors, lasers, etc.1–6 Displaying excellent optical and electronic properties, perovskite materials are known for their high carrier mobility, tunable band gap, high absorption coefficient, low trap density, and significant electron/hole diffusion length, which are crucial to achieve high-performance photovoltaic devices;7–11 moreover, in just a few years, a significant increment in the power conversion efficiency (PCE) has been achieved from a low value of 3.8% to 23.7%.12–15 Generally, the conventional configuration of a perovskite solar cell includes an electron transporting layer (ETL), followed by the perovskite absorber layer, and a hole transporting layer.16 In perovskite solar cells, the ETLs play critical roles in both the collection and transportation of photogenerated electrons as well as the suppression of the electron–hole recombination. Theoretically, an ideal ETL should possess the following qualities: good optical transparency, high efficiency in transporting the electrons and blocking holes, good electrical conductivity, and well-matched energy levels with the perovskite materials.17–19
To achieve a highly effective ETL, various wide band gap semiconducting materials, such as ZnO, SnO2, and TiO2, have been introduced into the ETLs in the hope of enhancing the overall photovoltaic performance of the device. Among the various materials, titanium dioxide (TiO2) has emerged as a promising ETL candidate due to its good transparency, chemical inertness, air stability, low cost, and non-toxicity.20,21 However, TiO2 is an n-type semiconducting material with a wide band gap of 3.2 eV. Compared to the ZnO and SnO2 ETLs, the TiO2 ETLs have relatively low electron mobility and poor electrical conductivity. As a result, metal doping is commonly employed to improve the electrical properties of the TiO2 compact layer as well as tailor the energy band structure for easy transportation of electrons from the perovskite layer to the transparent electrode.22–26 Furthermore, several studies have shown that the introduction of suitable n-type dopants into TiO2 can alter the material properties (grain size, orientation, conductivity, and optical properties) of pure TiO2, such that the rate of recombination is reduced, whereas the electron transport/injection properties are improved.27–30 For example, Zhang et al. reported that a solution-processed Mg-doped TiO2 compact layer enhanced the electron injection/transport properties through reduction in resistivity.31 Li et al., on the other hand, fabricated perovskite solar cells using a spray-coated La-doped TiO2 compact layer and achieved the efficiency of 17.2%.32 Similarly, Lv et al. showed the effective use of Zn-doped TiO2 as an efficient ETL with the fabricated cell having relatively good efficiency of 15.25% with enhanced device stability.33 Aluminium has been proven to be a promising dopant, especially when used in the TiO2 lattice. Apart from its relative abundance and low cost, the addition of aluminium has been reported to significantly improve the relatively poor conductivity of TiO2.34 When Ti4+ is replaced with a smaller oxidation state ion such as Al3+, substitutional point defects, such as oxygen vacancies, are introduced. Thus, theoretically, the addition of aluminium should enhance the charge carrier concentration as well as the electrical conductivity of the poorly conductive TiO2 electron transporting film.35 For example, Roose et al. reported that Al-doped TiO2 films exhibited excellent optical transparency and low resistivity.36 Moreover, in good agreement with this, Yun et al. reported the use of Al-doped TiO2-based perovskite solar cells having the efficiency of 14.7%.30 On the other hand, the addition of the indium metal is reported to reduce the work function of most of the oxide films due to the generation of large amount of free electrons.37 In particular, Peng et al. have shown an improved band alignment of indium-doped TiO2 ETL as compared to that of pristine TiO2 ETL, whereby the work function of In-TiO2 is closer to the conduction band energy level of perovskite.38 This being said, it is often hard to improve several cell parameters using simple ETL modification. For example, it is difficult to boost both fill factor (FF) through reduction in work function and/or enhanced conductivity whilst also improving the short-circuit current density (Jsc) via improved transparency of device. Therefore, there remain a large deficiency in the usage of simple ETL modification to enhance several cell parameters such as improved FF, Jsc, and energy alignment, simultaneously.
In this study, we introduced the trivalent dopants aluminium and indium into the conventional TiO2 ETL layer to form an AlIn-TiO2 ETL via simple solution-based processing. By adding aluminium and indium at stoichiometric amounts into the conventional TiO2 precursor solution, superior performance was achieved with the champion cell showing the significantly higher PCE of 19% as compared to the pristine TiO2 devices with the PCE of 16.67%. This is due to enhancement in the transparency and conductivity, as observed via the improved Jsc and FF, respectively, when AlIn is introduced into the TiO2 ETL. Furthermore, AlIn-TiO2 showed higher Voc as compared to the pristine devices due to the reduced work function and better energy level alignment. We further explored the usage of individual dopants and discovered that the addition of aluminium significantly altered the transparency and optical quality of the perovskite device through the improved Jsc values. On the other hand, the addition of indium leads to better energy level alignment and conductivity, as demonstrated by the enhanced Voc and FF, respectively. Thus, our study demonstrates a simple yet versatile co-doping method to utilize the advantages of both dopants and simultaneously improve several cell parameters, and the employment of AlIn-TiO2 leads to an upward shift in the conduction level, improved light transmittance, and enhanced electrical conductivity.
2. Results and discussion
The structural properties of the films were first characterized. Fig. S1 (ESI†) shows the XRD patterns of the pristine TiO2 and AlIn-TiO2 films. The diffraction patterns indicate the adoption of an anatase structure, corresponding to the (101) plane for both film samples. The intensity of diffraction peaks decreased after the incorporation of Al and In, implying a loss of crystallinity. Also, no other impurity phase was detected, indicating the absence of secondary phases in the as-prepared AlIn-TiO2 films. This could be attributed to the small doping concentration used and/or the homogeneous distribution of Al and In in TiO2.
To confirm the successful incorporation of Al and In into the TiO2 structure, XPS was utilized to unravel the chemical composition of the fabricated films. The XPS spectra of the TiO2 and AlIn-TiO2 films are shown in Fig. 1a–d. In good agreement with other studies, herein, peaks are observed at the binding energies of 458.25 and 464.06 eV representing the presence of Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 in the pristine TiO2 films, respectively.39 On the contrary, the Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 peaks of the AlIn-doped TiO2 film are shifted by a small degree towards the higher binding energies of 458.42 and 464.29 eV, respectively. Since Ti, Al, and In have the electronegativity values of 1.54, 1.61, and 1.78, respectively, a negative charge transfer towards the less electronegative aluminium and indium in the Ti–O–In–Al bond should occur.38,40 As such, the shifting could be reasoned using the Pauling electronegativity theory by which a shift in Ti 2p core binding energy towards that of higher levels was observed. Furthermore, the peak for O 1s, as shown in Fig. 1b, is found to be higher of 529.86 eV in AlIn-TiO2 film compared to pristine TiO2 film of 529.69 eV. In Fig. 1c, the In 3d5/2 and In 3d3/2 peaks are represented by the binding energies of 444.21 and 451.78 eV, respectively.41 The binding energy of Al 2p, as shown in Fig. 1d, is located at 74.19 eV.42 During the fabrication of the proposed AlIn-TiO2 film, 0.01 M of Al and 0.01 M of In were added to the dopant precursor solution. According to the XPS results obtained for our AlIn-TiO2 film, the atomic concentrations of Ti, O, Al and In in the doped TiO2 films are 26.95%, 70.98%, 1.35% and 0.72%, respectively. Basically, the XPS results suggest the successful incorporation of both the aluminium and the indium elements into the TiO2 lattice.

Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) and UV-visible transmittance spectroscopy were utilized to examine the energy levels of the TiO2 and AlIn-TiO2 films. As shown in Fig. 1e, the valence band maximum (EVBM) energy levels of the TiO2 and AlIn-TiO2 films are −7.45 and −7.24 eV, respectively, calculated from the equation EVBM = −[21.22 − (Ecutoff − Eonset)], where Ecutoff is the higher binding energy cutoff and Eonset is the onset energy in the valence band region. Furthermore, the conduction band minimum (ECBM) energy levels were estimated using the corresponding optical band gap and EVBM levels. As seen in Fig. S2 (ESI†), AlIn-doped TiO2 displays better optical transmittance as compared to the pristine TiO2 ETL film at the wavelength between 400 and 900 nm. The higher transmittance consequently contributes towards the improved photocurrent. To calculate the band gap of the as-prepared films, we employed the Tauc equation: (αhν) = A(hν − Eg)1/2, with α being the absorption coefficient, h the Planck's constant, A a constant, and Eg and ν representing the band gap and the corresponding frequency of radiation, respectively. Fig. 1f shows the plot of (αhν)2 against hν for both the TiO2 and AlIn-TiO2 films. Using the abovementioned formula, the band gaps of the TiO2 and AlIn-TiO2 films were estimated by the extrapolation of a straight linear fit over the energy axis in the Tauc plots. The band gap of the AlIn-TiO2 films was found to be 3.31 eV, higher than that of the TiO2 films (3.20 eV). The calculated ECBM levels of the TiO2 and AlIn-doped TiO2 films were −4.25 and −3.93 eV, respectively.

Fig. 2a shows the schematic of the fabricated perovskite device consisting of the following layers: an FTO-coated glass substrate as the transparent electrode, TiO2 or AlIn-TiO2 as the ETL, meso-TiO2, triple-cation perovskite layer, hole-transporting spiro-OMeTAD layer, and the gold (Au) layer as the back-contact. The exact cross-sectional morphology of the complete solar device is shown in Fig. 2b, with the equivalent thickness of the compact AlIn-doped TiO2, mesoporous TiO2, perovskite, spiro-OMeTAD, and Au films being 60, 200, 390, 180, and 80 nm, respectively. The energy level diagrams, including the characterized energy levels of TiO2 and AlIn-TiO2, of the materials are shown in Fig. 2c. The valence band maximum (VBM) and conduction band minimum (CBM) values of meso-TiO2 and perovskite were obtained from literature.43,44 The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) for the spiro-OMeTAD was reported as −5.20 eV, whereas the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) was −2.50 eV.45 Since the CBM level of AlIn-TiO2 (−3.93 eV) is closer to that of perovskite than that of TiO2 (−4.25 eV), the transportation of electrons towards the FTO electrode should occur with less potential losses in the AlIn-TiO2-based devices. Moreover, the HOMO levels of both AlIn-TiO2 (−7.24 eV) and TiO2 (−7.45 eV) are much lower than those of perovskite (−5.40 eV) and spiro-OmeTAD (−5.20 eV), ensuring effective hole blocking whereby hole transport from spiro-OmeTAD to the Au electrode is efficiently carried out.

The TiO2, Al-TiO2, In-TiO2, and AlIn-TiO2 layers were deposited on the FTO substrates by spin coating. We had optimized the Al-TiO2 and In-TiO2 compact layers by using different precursor concentrations (0.02 M, 0.04 M, and 0.06 M) which were obtained using simple sol–gel method containing different amounts of aluminum nitrate nonahydrate and indium(III) nitrate hydrate added to a fixed volume of solvent of 2-methoxyethanol (5 mL) and acetylacetone (230 μL). The triple-cation-based perovskite devices with varied ETL materials, namely TiO2, Al-TiO2, In-TiO2, and AlIn-TiO2, were fabricated and studied. As shown in Fig. 2d, the current density–voltage (J–V) properties of the TiO2 and AlIn-TiO2-based devices have been examined. These measurements were carried out in ambient air under AM1.5G illumination at the light intensity of 100 mW cm−2. The device performance presented in Table 1 shows a good contrast between the devices fabricated with the TiO2 and AlIn-TiO2 ETL. Displaying relatively poorer performance, the control device consisting of the TiO2 ETL achieved the PCE of 16.67%, open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.04 V, short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 21.17 mA cm−2, and fill factor (FF) of 75.43%. On the other hand, a solar cell with the 0.02 M Al-TiO2 ETL achieved the PCE of 17.98% with the Voc, Jsc, and FF corresponding to 1.05 V, 22.07 mA cm−2, and 77.18%. Further addition of Al-doping, however, deteriorated the performances of the devices with corresponding PCE of 17.43 and 17.15% for 0.04 M and 0.06 M Al-TiO2 ETL based devices, respectively. The perovskite solar cells with 0.02 M In-TiO2 exhibited the PCE of 18.04% with the Voc of 1.05 V, Jsc of 21.75 mA cm−2, and FF of 78.67%. Variation in the In concentration of the In-TiO2-based devices also resulted in a similar trend as that observed during Al-doping. More details regarding the device performance upon varying the Al and In concentrations are summarized in Table S1 and Fig. S3 (ESI†). Therefore, precursor concentration of 0.02 M was determined as the optimal concentration to achieve superior photovoltaic performance (Voc, Jsc and FF) of the device, as observed in both the Al-TiO2 and In-TiO2 ETL-based cells as compared to the case of pristine TiO2 ETL. When the device was co-doped with 0.01 M Al and 0.01 M In, the AlIn-TiO2 ETL-based devices delivered paramount performance with the Voc of 1.07 V, Jsc of 22.30 mA cm−2, FF of 79.50%, and overall device efficiency of 19%. To further improve the optical transmittance and device performance, an anti-reflection film was attached to the front side of the glass substrate. As observed in Fig. S4 (ESI†), the AlIn-TiO2-based device with anti-reflection film exhibited the PCE of 19.31% with the Voc of 1.07 V, Jsc of 22.66 mA cm−2, and FF of 79.60%.

The AlIn-TiO2 ETL has higher optical transmission (Fig. S2, ESI†) and wider energy band gap (Fig. 1f), accounting for the higher Jsc values observed in the AlIn-TiO2-based solar cells. The series resistance (Rseries) and shunt resistance (Rshunt) were derived from the J–V curves. Note that the AlIn-TiO2-based device has smaller Rseries and larger Rshunt than the pristine TiO2 device. Therefore, higher FF was observed in this case. Furthermore, the conductivity, Hall mobility, and carrier density were measured using the Hall-effect measurements. As presented in Table S2 (ESI†), the conductivity of the AlIn-doped-TiO2 films is higher than that of the pristine TiO2 films. This could be caused by the increased Hall mobility and carrier density, thus reducing the series resistance in the AlIn-TiO2-based devices.
Steady-state efficiencies were also studied for both the TiO2 and AlIn-TiO2-based devices. As seen in Fig. 2e, the perovskite solar cells with the AlIn-TiO2 ETL display the Jsc of 20.04 mA cm−2 and PCE of 18.06% at the voltage bias of 0.90 V. On the contrary, the perovskite solar cells with the TiO2 ETL demonstrate the poorer Jsc of 18.64 mA cm−2 and PCE of 15.60% at the voltage bias of 0.83 V. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the TiO2, Al-TiO2, In-TiO2, and AlIn-TiO2-based perovskite solar cells are shown in Fig. 2f and Fig. S5 (ESI†). It can be seen that the AlIn-TiO2-based device exhibits higher IPCE intensity over the entire wavelength range from 300 to 780 nm as compared to the pristine TiO2, Al-TiO2, and In-TiO2-based devices. The current density (Jsc) values of 19.54, 20.13, 19.94, and 20.58 mA cm−2 were achieved for the TiO2, Al-TiO2, In-TiO2, and AlIn-TiO2-based devices, respectively. To check the reproducibility of the devices, we fabricated the TiO2 and AlIn-TiO2-based devices as represented in Fig. 3. Since the photovoltaic performance of each device only suffers a small deviation, the as-fabricated devices display good reproducibility with the average PCE of TiO2 and AlIn-TiO2-based devices being 16.0% and 18.20%, respectively. In addition, we also examined the long-term stability of all the devices fabricated without any encapsulation, as seen in Fig. S6 (ESI†). For the pristine TiO2-based device, the retained initial PCE was approximately 80% with the corresponding Voc of 1.04 V, Jsc of 19.85 mA cm−2, FF of 65.26, and PCE of 13.47%. On the contrary, the AlIn-TiO2-based device was able to retain 89% of the initial PCE with the corresponding Voc of 1.09 V, Jsc of 20.87 mA cm−2, FF of 74.27, and PCE of 16.90% even after being stored for 25 days under ambient conditions. There are various factors, such as interfacial defects on the surface, grain boundaries, and deep trap-assisted recombination, that affect the stability of the perovskite solar cells. Herein, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data, as shown in the later part of this study (Fig. 5), show higher recombination resistance in the devices with AlIn-TiO2. This implies that the devices with AlIn-TiO2 layer possess significantly lower amounts of traps as compared to those with the pristine TiO2 layer. Therefore, we postulated that one possible factor responsible for the better stability could be the reduced amount of traps in the AlIn-TiO2 layer, which further facilitated better charge transfer between the ETL and perovskite.

We further investigated the optical behaviour of perovskite on the ETLs. The absorption spectra of perovskite on glass, perovskite on TiO2, and perovskite on AlIn-TiO2 samples are shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†). A slight blue shift of the perovskite films on TiO2 and AlIn-doped TiO2 films was observed when compared with the case of the pure perovskite films on glass. To investigate the charge recombination behaviour, the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of these samples were obtained using excitation at 600 nm as shown in Fig. 4a. The peak observed at approximately 775 nm corresponds to the excited states (bound excitons) in the perovskite. When the perovskite layer was deposited on a glass substrate, a sharp PL peak with high intensity was observed, suggesting the excellent quality of the fabricated perovskite film. This high-quality perovskite film allows the bound excitons to exist in the film for a long period of time before being separated into their individual electron and hole charge carriers. On the other hand, the PL intensity was found to be appreciably reduced when the perovskite film was deposited on top of the TiO2 film. Even larger reduction was observed for the AlIn-TiO2 film. A similar quenching trend was observed for the PL decay lifetimes, as seen in Fig. 4b. According to the time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) results, the perovskite deposited on glass exhibited the longest average fluorescence lifetime of τ = 233.9 ns. When perovskite was deposited on the TiO2 film, a significant reduction in lifetime was observed (τ = 208.5 ns). A further reduction in lifetime was observed for the perovskite film deposited on AlIn-TiO2 (τ = 150.1 ns). Through the larger PL quenching observed in the AlIn-TiO2-based film as compared to that in the pristine TiO2, it is evident that co-doping of Al and In into TiO2 allows superior charge separation of excitons formed in the perovskite layer. The full data is summarised in Table S3 (ESI†).

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were used to investigate the charge transport process, contact resistance, and carrier recombination of the TiO2 and AlIn-TiO2-based perovskite solar cells. Under dark condition, the Nyquist plots of the TiO2 and AlIn-TiO2-based devices were obtained with the applied forward bias of 800 mV, as shown in Fig. 5. Generally, there are two arcs in the Nyquist plot; the first arc located in the high-frequency region is related to the contact resistance of the interface, whereas the second arc located at lower frequencies corresponds to the recombination resistance and chemical capacitance of a device. An equivalent circuit (Fig. S8, ESI†) was used to fit the data in the Nyquist plots, and the corresponding values representing the recombination (Rrec) and series (Rseries) resistances are shown in Table S4 (ESI†).46 As seen, the recombination resistance values of the TiO2 and AlIn-TiO2 samples are 5.40 and 56.9 kΩ, respectively. Through the larger recombination resistance displayed in the AlIn-doped TiO2 sample and smaller recombination rate, it is evident that the charge transport of carriers is greatly promoted using the co-doped ETL, accounting for the marked increase in Jsc as compared to that of the pristine TiO2 sample. Therefore, the superior Voc and Jsc exhibited by the AlIn-doped TiO2 device can be correlated to the highly efficient electron extraction/transportation and lowered recombination rate.

3. Conclusion
In summary, we demonstrated an effective method to boost several cell parameters via simple ETL modification. The introduction of both trivalent Al and In into TiO2 is believed to significantly enhance the overall photovoltaic efficiency via three factors. First, the conductivity of the AlIn-TiO2 devices was tremendously improved, as indicated by the increased FF. Second, better band alignment in the modified ETL layer was observed whereby an upward shift in the conduction band, reduced work function, and therefore, enhanced Voc were observed as compared to the pristine TiO2 device. Finally, the AlIn-TiO2 devices also displayed enhanced optical quality and transmittance, as indicated by the improved Jsc value. Through these simultaneous improvements in various photovoltaic cell parameters, paramount efficiency of 19% was attained via the usage of simple co-doping in the conventional TiO2 ETL.

In our study, the AlIn-doped TiO2 compact layer was prepared via a simple sol–gel method using stoichiometric amounts of titanium(IV) butoxide (0.45 M), aluminum nitrate nonahydrate (0.01 M), and indium(III) nitrate hydrate (0.01 M) dissolved in 2-methoxyethanol and acetylacetone. After 3 h of stirring at room temperature, a clear and homogeneous light-yellowish solution was attained. To prepare thin films of the AlIn-doped TiO2 ETL, the as-prepared sol was spin coated on the FTO surface. Then, the AlIn-doped TiO2 thin films were formed after annealing at 500 °C for 1 h.
Device fabrication
For perovskite solar cell fabrication, we followed the standard device configuration of FTO/AlIn-TiO2/meso-TiO2/perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD/Au. The fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrates were patterned using Zn powder and diluted HCl. The etched FTO glass substrates were sequentially cleaned through sonication in detergent, deionized water, and a variety of alcohols, followed by UV treatment for 20 min. The AlIn-TiO2 compact layer was then deposited on the FTO surface at the spin rate of 3000 rpm (at the acceleration of 500 rpm) for 40 s. Later, the coated FTO substrates were annealed at 500 °C for 1 h in air and cooled down to room temperature. Mesoporous TiO2 (meso-TiO2) was prepared by dissolving the TiO2 (30-NRD) paste in absolute ethanol. The as-prepared meso-TiO2 solution was then spun at 5000 rpm for 30 s and annealed at 500 °C for 15 min. Subsequently, the samples were subjected to UV ozone treatment before perovskite spin coating. To prepare the perovskite precursor solution, 507 mg of PbI2 (1.1 M), 172 mg of FAI (1.0 M), 81 mg of PbBr2 (0.22 M), and 22.3 mg of MABr (0.2 M) were added to 1 mL of a mixture consisting of 800 μL of anhydrous DMF with 200 μL of anhydrous DMSO. Then, 42 μL of the stock solution of CsI (1.5 M) was added to the abovementioned mixed solution. The solution was stirred for 3 h at room temperature. The triple-cation perovskite solution was deposited through a two-step spin coating program: at first, at 2000 rpm for 10 s and then at 6000 rpm for 30 s. Then, after 15 s into the second step, 100 μL of chlorobenzene was drop casted on the spinning substrate followed by an hour of annealing at 100 °C. Dissolved in 1 mL of chlorobenzene, 70 mg spiro-OmeTAD, 28 μL 4-tert-butylpyridine, 16.94 μL bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)amine lithium salt, and 35 μL FK209 Co(III) TFSI salt (18.8 mg/50 μL in acetonitrile) were used to prepare the spiro-OMeTAD solution. After this, the solution was spun at 4000 rpm for 30 s to form a thin spiro-OMeTAD above the perovskite layer. The perovskite and spiro-OMeTAD depositions were carried out in an argon-filled glove box. Finally, thermal evaporation was employed to deposit 80 nm of gold as the last layer of the complete device.
Characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies were carried out using an X-ray diffractometer (D8 Advance). A photoelectron spectrometer (AXIS-His) was utilized for performing X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, AXIS-HSi). Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurements were conducted using AXIS Ultra DLD (KRATOS Inc.) consisting of a monochromatic He I (21.22 eV) light source. The morphologies of the devices were examined using a field emission scanning electron microscope (JEJOL JSM-7600F). For current density–voltage (J–V) characterisation, the Keithley 2612A source meter unit was used under simulated Air Mass 1.5 global (AM 1.5G) solar illumination with the intensity of 100 mW cm−2. The light intensity of the solar simulator was calibrated against a standard silicon device. Incident photon-to-current conversion (IPCE) spectra were obtained using the dual xenon/quartz halogen light PVE300 (Bentham) source without light bias. Absorption spectra were obtained by a UV-vis spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, UV-1800). Photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the films were obtained using a spectrofluorophotometer (Shimadzu, RF-5301PC). The effective area of the solar cell was 0.090 cm2. Electrical properties of the films were determined by the Hall-effect measurements (MMR Technologies, H-50) using the Van der Pauw method. Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurements were conducted using a time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) system (PicoQuant, PicoHarp 300). A picosecond-pulsed laser diode (λ = 405 nm, f = 40 MHz) (Picoquant P-C-405B) was used to excite the sample. Impedance spectroscopy measurements were conducted inside an argon-filled glove box with Autolab PGSTAT302N by applying a 20 mV perturbation with the frequencies varying from 10 Hz to 1 MHz at the DC voltage of 800 mV under the dark condition.
