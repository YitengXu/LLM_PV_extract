    , Accepted 3rd September 2018First published on 4th September 2018AbstractIn this paper, a high-performance BiVO4 photoanode deposited with serial hole transfer layers was fabricated for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting in order to overcome the shortcomings of pure BiVO4 electrodes in terms of poor charge transport properties and undesirable surface water oxidation kinetics. The hole transfer layer of Fe2O3 was first deposited on the surface of pure BiVO4 to promote the hole transfer from the bulk of the semiconductor to the electrode surface (bulk/surface transfer process), and then the hole transfer layer of NiOOH/FeOOH was deposited on the surface to improve the hole transfer from the electrode surface to the electrolyte (surface/electrolyte transfer process). The results showed a remarkable improvement in PEC water splitting performance for the NiOOH/FeOOH/Fe2O3/BiVO4 photoanode. The photocurrent was up to 2.24 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE, which was about 2.95 times that of the pristine BiVO4 photoanode. Meanwhile, the charge transport efficiencies in the bulk (ηbulk) and the surface (ηsurface) were enhanced by 1.63 and 2.62 times compared to those of the BiVO4 photoanode at 1.23 V vs. RHE, respectively. In addition, the novel photoanode was assembled with a commercial silicon PVC for self-bias PEC water splitting, and a stable photocurrent density of ∼2.60 mA cm−2, corresponding to a ∼3.2% STH conversion efficiency, was achieved spontaneously. Our study provided a more efficient serial hole transfer strategy for achieving a BiVO4 photoanode with enhanced PEC water splitting.
1. Introduction
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting is a promising technology for collecting solar energy as a hydrogen fuel to deal with the energy crisis. In the PEC technique, the anodic reaction involving water oxidation has received considerable attention due to its more difficult multi-electron process.1 However, developing photoanodes with excellent photocurrent performance is really challenging because it must meet the requirements of effective minority carrier transfer (holes for n-type semiconductors), ideal bandgap, anodic stability and low cost.2
N-Type bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) has attracted the attention of many researchers for PEC water-splitting devices as it can absorb a large part of the visible spectrum with a bandgap of ∼2.4 eV and has a suitable valence band (VB) edge, which can provide sufficient overpotential to oxidize water to O2.3,4 During the water oxidation process in the BiVO4 photoanode, the photogenerated holes first transfer from the bulk of the semiconductor to the electrode surface (bulk/surface transfer process); subsequently, holes at the electrode surface have to further transfer to the electrolyte to split water (surface/electrolyte transfer process). These two hole transfer processes directly determine the hole utilization efficiency and the ultimate PEC performance. Nevertheless, the pure BiVO4 electrode without being decorated with other semiconductors or catalysts severely suffers from (i) poor charge transport properties and (ii) undesirable surface hole transfer kinetics for water oxidation,5,6 of which poor charge transport properties lead to excessive electron–hole recombination in BiVO4 bulk and thus few holes reach the surface of the BiVO4 photoanode (poor bulk/surface transfer process), while undesirable water oxidation kinetics mean that the holes at the electrode surface cannot effectively transfer to the electrolyte for water splitting (poor surface/electrolyte transfer process) (Fig. 1a). To fully exploit the advantageous features of BiVO4, many attempts, including morphology control,7 forming heterojunction structures,6,8 doping or composition tuning,9,10 and depositing oxygen evolution catalysts (OECs),11 have been made. However, these two issues cannot be solved by a single modification, resulting in an unimpressive photocurrent performance compared with its theoretical value.
 Fig. 1  Schematic diagram of the proposed hole transfer and recombination model in (a) BiVO4, (b) Fe2O3/BiVO4, and (c) NiOOH/FeOOH/Fe2O3/BiVO4 (data obtained from ref. 14). The explosive shapes refer to hole recombination in the bulk or at surface states (SS). The thickness of the lines corresponds to the relative rates of electron and hole transfer. 
In this paper, Fe2O3 and NiOOH/FeOOH serial hole transfer layers were successively deposited on the BiVO4 surface to enhance the bulk/surface hole transfer process and the surface/electrolyte hole transfer process simultaneously (Fig. 1c). As high-efficiency hole transfer layers for BiVO4, SnO2 and WO3 each have a synergistic effect to improve the PEC properties of BiVO4.12,13 However, poor water oxidation kinetics and corrosion of the surface BiVO4 film still need to be enhanced because BiVO4 is deposited on the top of SnO2 and WO3 layers in these studies. In contrast, Fe2O3 is an Earth-abundant, low-cost and environment-friendly semiconductor with a relatively narrow bandgap energy (Eg ≈ 2.2 eV).13 Most importantly, the Fe2O3 layer can promote the bulk/surface hole transfer because its valence band edge can match well with that of BiVO4,14 which allows more holes to transfer from the bulk of the semiconductor to the surface (Fig. 1b). Meanwhile, the photogenerated electrons will transfer from BiVO4 to Fe2O3 and the electron density will be improved until a new thermodynamic equilibrium is built between the two layers, which thus leads to the upward-bent band and further enhances hole transfer efficiency.8 Apparently, the improved photogenerated hole transfer can highly decrease the electron–hole recombination in the bulk of BiVO4 and more holes will transfer to the electrode surface. However, this will cause a large amount of hole accumulation at the electrode surface which recombine with the electrons excited near the electrode surface (Fig. 1b), since a slow surface water oxidation kinetics process exists. Therefore, it is necessary to transfer the surface holes at the electrode surface through other hole transfer layers.
FeOOH and NiOOH have been reported to significantly improve the surface water oxidation kinetics of the BiVO4 photoanode.11,15 Among them, FeOOH has been previously reported as an ideal catalyst that interfaces well with BiVO4,16 while NiOOH has shown higher activity for water oxidation than FeOOH at the surface of the electrode.17 In particular, the NiOOH/FeOOH dual layer often demonstrated a synergistic effect11,18 and either Ni or Fe alone exhibits weaker activity for oxygen evolution than Ni–Fe catalysts.19 Herein, we simultaneously deposited Fe2O3 and NiOOH/FeOOH on the surface of the BiVO4 photoanode and the NiOOH/FeOOH dual-layer, which formed another hole transfer layer to efficiently transfer surface-reaching holes to the electrolyte for water splitting (Fig. 1c). Finally, the serial hole transfer layers of Fe2O3 and NiOOH/FeOOH should simultaneously alleviate bulk and surface charge recombination and enhance the water splitting performance (Fig. 1c). The results proved our theoretical analysis that the optimized NiOOH/FeOOH/Fe2O3/BiVO4 photoanode exhibited an improved photocurrent of 2.24 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE, which was about 2.95 times that of the pristine BiVO4 photoanode. Meanwhile, the efficiencies of charge transport in the bulk (ηbulk) and the surface (ηsurface) were enhanced by 1.63 and 2.62 times that of the BiVO4 photoanode at 1.23 V vs. RHE, respectively. Further electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and Mott–Schottky plot studies were also conducted to study the hole transfer layers and the results were consistent with our assumption. In addition, the photoanode was then assembled with a commercial silicon PVC for the self-bias PEC cell, and a stable photocurrent density of ∼2.60 mA cm−2, corresponding to a ∼3.2% STH conversion efficiency, was achieved spontaneously. The O2 and H2 evolution rates are up to approximately 49.5 and 25.1 μmol cm−2 h−1, respectively.
2. Experimental
2.1 Fabrication of the BiVO4 photoanode
The BiVO4 photoelectrode was fabricated using a spin-coating method.8 20 mL 2 M nitric acid aqueous solution (HNO3) containing 300 mM bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) was prepared by dissolving 2.91 g bismuth nitrate pentahydrate (BiNO3·5H2O) and 0.70 g ammonium metavanadate (NH4VO3). The as-prepared solution was then spin-coated on a rectangular fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)-coated glass (2.5 cm × 5 cm) to fabricate the BiVO4 layers. Then the sample was annealed at 450 °C on a hot plate three times after each round of spin-coating. Finally, the electrode was annealed in a furnace at 450 °C for 180 min with a heating rate of 1 °C min−1.
2.2. Preparation of Fe2O3 hole transfer layers
Then, 0.1 M Fe(NO3)3·9H2O and 0.1 M NaOH aqueous solutions were successively spin coated on the prepared BiVO4 photoelectrode. During the spin-coating process, the prepared solutions should stay at the BiVO4 electrode surface for 2 min to ensure adequate reaction between Fe(NO3)3 and NaOH. After 6 rounds of spin coating, the sample was finally annealed in a furnace at 450 °C for 120 min to crystallize Fe2O3 hole transfer layers.
2.3. Photodeposition of NiOOH/FeOOH hole transfer layers
A modified photo-/electro-deposition procedure was utilized to deposit FeOOH and NiOOH.11 In order to deposit NiOOH/FeOOH on the BiVO4-based electrode, an optimized FeOOH layer was first photodeposited on the Fe2O3/BiVO4 using the conditions described in the ESI,† and then a NiOOH layer was successively photodeposited. Various deposition times were tested to optimize the best deposition amount for both FeOOH and NiOOH (for details see the ESI†). Then the electrodes were followed by additional electrodeposition of NiOOH at 1.2 V vs. Ag/AgCl for 60 s; the resulting photoanodes were denoted as NiOOH/FeOOH/Fe2O3/BiVO4. FeOOH, NiOOH and FeOOH/NiOOH were also deposited on the Fe2O3/BiVO4 electrode in order to compare with the NiOOH/FeOOH/Fe2O3/BiVO4 photoanode.
2.4. Characterization of the photoanodes
The morphologies of the as-prepared photoanodes were investigated by field emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Zeiss Ultra Plus) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL JEM-2100F). The crystal phase was studied using X-ray diffractometry (XRD; AXS-8 Advance, Bruker, Germany). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was conducted using an AXIS Ultra DLD instrument (Kratos, Shimadzu, Japan) with non-chromatic Al Kα radiation at 12 kV and 25 mA. In addition, the UV–vis absorption spectra were examined using a UV–vis spectrophotometer (TU-1901, PGeneral Instrument Inc., China).
2.5. Photoelectrochemical property tests
A monochromator (Zolix, China), a 500 W xenon arc lamp, a calibrated silicon photodetector and a power meter were utilized to study the incident photon-to-charge conversion efficiency (IPCE). The PEC tests, including IPCE spectra, J–V curves, and J–t curves, EIS data, M–S plots, and charge separation efficiency, were assessed using an electrochemical workstation (CHI 660c, CH Instruments Inc., USA) in a three-electrode system with the as-prepared films as the working electrode (WE), a platinum cathode as the counter electrode (CE), and a Ag/AgCl electrode as the reference electrode (RE) in a 0.1 M KH2PO4 (pH 7) electrolyte solution. The transient photocurrent and transient photovoltage were measured using an electrochemical workstation (Zahner; CIMPS, Germany) with the same three-electrode system. A 300 W Xe lamp (PerfectLight, China) with an AM 1.5 filter was used for simulated solar light illumination (light density, 100 mW cm−2). The potentials measured relative to the Ag/AgCl electrode were transformed into the RHE using the following equation:  where ERHE is the calculated potential vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), EAg/AgCl is the measured potential vs. the Ag/AgCl electrode, the pH value is 7 and  is 0.1981 V at 25 °C.
2.6. Assembly and test of the PEC water-splitting device
First, three different types of commercial silicon photovoltaic cells (PVCs), including bi-cell, tri-cell and tetra-cell Si, were used to assemble a composite electrode with the novel NiOOH/FeOOH/Fe2O3/BiVO4 photoanode. Although they have the exact same function area, they generate different photovoltages and photocurrents. For optimal performance, the matching results were tested. Details of different PVCs and the assembly process of the composite electrode are presented in the ESI† using digital photographs (Fig. S12 and S13†). Finally, the PEC water-splitting device was fabricated as a two-electrode system by using the as-prepared composite electrode as the working electrode, and Pt black as the counter electrode in a 0.1 mol L−1 sodium sulfate (Na2SO4) electrolyte.
The hydrogen and oxygen evolution was measured in the above two-electrode system with moderate stirring. A photograph of the characterization system for the PEC water splitting configuration is shown in Fig. S15.† A quartz device (LabSolar-IIIAG, Perfect Light, China) was used to collect hydrogen and oxygen, and a gas chromatograph (GC; GC-2010 plus, Shimadzu, Japan) system was used to analyze the amount of H2 and O2 after certain intervals. All experiments were performed under ambient conditions.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. The characterization of the NiOOH/FeOOH/Fe2O3/BiVO4 photoanode

Fig. 2 shows representative top-view and cross-view SEM images of BiVO4, Fe2O3/BiVO4 and NiOOH/FeOOH/Fe2O3/BiVO4 photoanodes. The BiVO4 photoanode was composed of ∼200 nm crystal particles with the existence of some nanopores (Fig. 2a). After modifying a thin Fe2O3 layer, the boundary of the BiVO4 crystal particles became obscure (Fig. 2b). For the NiOOH/FeOOH/Fe2O3/BiVO4 photoanode, uniform particles with a grain size of 90–240 nm (mean size ∼150 nm) appeared tightly packed on the electrode surface (Fig. 2c and Fig. S2a†). The SEM-EDS spectrum and the EDS atomic ratio of Bi, V, O, Fe, and Ni were measured for three BiVO4-based photoanodes, and the Bi/V atomic ratio for all three photoanodes was nearly 1.0 with slightly lower Bi content (Fig. S1†). The cross-sectional SEM images were also studied to confirm the thickness of the samples. A roughly 150 nm well-connected sample layer was observed for the three photoanodes, but no apparent thickness change was observed after the deposition of the serial hole transfer layers (Fig. 2a′, b′ and c′), which might be attributed to the small amount and ultrathinness of both Fe2O3 and NiOOH/FeOOH layers.

The element mapping using SEM is shown for the NiOOH/FeOOH/Fe2O3/BiVO4 photoanode in Fig. S2b–f,† and the elements Bi, V, O, Fe, and Ni appeared uniformly. The uniform distribution of Fe and Ni indicated that the serial hole transfer layers of Fe2O3 and NiOOH/FeOOH grow uniformly on the surface of the BiVO4 photoanode. XRD patterns of BiVO4 and NiOOH/FeOOH/Fe2O3/BiVO4 photoanodes are also shown in Fig. S3.† The diffraction peaks at 18.7°, 28.8°, 30.5° and 53.3° confirmed that BiVO4 has a monoclinic structure (JCPDS 14-0688).20 However, no characteristic diffraction peaks of Fe2O3 appeared on the XRD curves because of its lower loading content.
To further investigate the composition of the serial hole transfer layers in the NiOOH/FeOOH/Fe2O3/BiVO4 photoanode, high-resolution TEM images were collected. Fig. 3a shows the representative TEM image of materials at the photoanode surface, while Fig. 3b and c show the typical area in Fig. 3a. Fig. 3b and c show an interplanar spacing of 0.309 and 0.252 nm, which could match with the d-spacing of the BiVO4 (−121)21 and Fe2O3 (110)22 planes, respectively. This confirmed the crystal structure generation of BiVO4 and Fe2O3 after high-temperature annealing. In addition, the thickness of the Fe2O3 layer was estimated to be 5–15 nm, which is in agreement with a previous report.8 Notably, as shown in the enlarged images of Fig. 3c, an amorphous layer with no observable lattice fringes was observed with a thickness of 1–2 nm, which indicated the existence of an amorphous FeOOH/NiOOH layer.

XPS analysis was also conducted to confirm the physicochemical states of the serial hole transfer layers. As shown in Fig. 4a, peaks of 158.8 and 164.2 eV correspond to Bi3+ 4f7/2 and Bi3+ 4f5/2 in the NiOOH/FeOOH/Fe2O3/BiVO4 photoanode, respectively.23 In addition, peaks of 516.4 and 524.1 eV for V 2p were assigned to V5+ in BiVO4.24 Peaks with a binding energy of 711.1 and 724.5 eV correspond to Fe 2p3/2 and Fe 2p1/2 for the as-prepared photoanodes, with a characteristic satellite peak matching α-Fe2O3 appearing at 718.4 eV.25,26 Furthermore, the Ni 2p spectrum (Fig. 4d) clearly evidenced the presence of two chemical environments for Ni atoms, and the 852.5 and 869.8 eV peaks correspond to Ni 2p3/2 and Ni 2p1/2, respectively.27 There were three peaks in the O 1s at 528.8, 529.8, and 531.0 eV. The peak at 528.8 eV was attributed to the [Ni–O] of NiOOH, while the peak at 529.8 eV was attributed to the lattice oxygen of hematite, BiVO4, and the [Fe–O] of FeOOH.8,28,29 The peak at 531.0 eV was identified as O–H.27,28

Furthermore, XPS spectra of BiVO4, Fe2O3/BiVO4, and FeOOH/Fe2O3/BiVO4 are also provided in Fig. S4† for the comparison and assignment of the peaks. Peaks for Fe 2p appeared after decorating Fe2O3 on the surface of BiVO4, while peaks for Ni 2p only appeared after photodepositing NiOOH (Fig. S3†). Peaks for O 1s did not show an obvious difference, but they offered help in the assignment of O 1s peaks. These results suggested the presence of FeOOH and NiOOH in the prepared photoanode.
3.2. Photoelectrochemical properties of the as-prepared photoanodes
Since Fe2O3 had a short carrier diffusion length and excessive Fe2O3 would induce charge recombination,13 it was necessary to optimize the thickness of Fe2O3 layers to improve the PEC performance. In addition, the amounts of FeOOH and NiOOH might play an important role in the hole transfer process. Thus, prior to studying the effect of serial hole transfer layers, different layers of Fe2O3 (Fig. S5†), photodeposition times for FeOOH and NiOOH (Fig. S7†) were optimized. Besides, FeOOH, NiOOH and FeOOH/NiOOH were also deposited on Fe2O3/BiVO4 to obtain the best photoanode performance (Fig. S8 and Fig. S9†). Finally, three layers of Fe2O3 and the NiOOH/FeOOH dual layer were selected as the hole transfer layers for BiVO4. Detailed results and discussions are shown in the ESI.†

Fig. 5a shows the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) plots measured in a 0.1 M phosphate buffer solution (pH 7) for the four BiVO4-based photoanodes under both front-side and back-side illumination. Unless otherwise specified, the measurement was conducted under front-side illumination. The photocurrent density measured under AM 1.5 illumination was 0.76 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE for bare BiVO4; when modified with a Fe2O3 layer the photocurrent was up to 1.53 mA cm−2. The highly enhanced photoresponse could be attributed to the improved hole transfer by the valence band edge of Fe2O3, which was slightly higher than that of BiVO4 (Fig. 1). However, when BiVO4 was later deposited on the surface of the Fe2O3 layer, photogenerated holes in the Fe2O3 layer could not transfer to the top BiVO4 layer for water oxidation (Fig. S6b†), leading to lower photocurrents than in the bare BiVO4 electrode.
 Fig. 5  Comparison of (a) J–V curves (both front-side and back-side illuminations were measured and indicated as “front” and “back”, respectively), (b) transient photocurrents, (c) UV–vis absorption spectra and (d) IPCE for BiVO4 (black line), Fe2O3/BiVO4 (green), NiOOH/FeOOH/BiVO4 (blue), and NiOOH/FeOOH/Fe2O3/BiVO4 (red). 
On the other hand, the NiOOH/FeOOH/BiVO4 photoanode was investigated to confirm the effect of the NiOOH/FeOOH surface layer and the necessity of the Fe2O3 hole transfer layer. After depositing FeOOH and NiOOH, the photocurrent was significantly improved to 1.73 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE, which is consistent with the photocurrents when illumination was turned on in Fig. 5b. In fact, NiOOH/FeOOH/BiVO4 exhibited a better photocurrent decrease when the light was on than Fe2O3/BiVO4, indicating that the NiOOH/FeOOH layer could better prohibit surface recombination than the Fe2O3 layer (Fig. 5a).
Just as we had expected, the NiOOH/FeOOH/Fe2O3/BiVO4 photoanode showed the maximum photocurrent of 2.24 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE, which was about 2.95 times that of the pristine BiVO4 photoanode. This photocurrent was also about 46.4%, 29.5% higher than that of the Fe2O3/BiVO4 and NiOOH/FeOOH/BiVO4 photoanodes, respectively, suggesting that the NiOOH/FeOOH/Fe2O3/BiVO4 photoanode integrated the excellent properties of both the Fe2O3 layer for bulk hole transfer and the Ni–Fe layer for surface hole transfer. Besides, the serial hole transfer layers of Fe2O3 and NiOOH/FeOOH also improved the stability of the BiVO4 photoanode (Fig. S10†). The increased stability might be attributed to the fact that the overlayers prevented the direct corrosion of the electrolyte to the bare BiVO4 electrode, which made it possible for practical PEC application. In summary, the serial hole transfer layers of Fe2O3 and NiOOH/FeOOH highly enhanced the photoresponse of BiVO4 photoanodes for water oxidation.
Compared with those under front-side illumination, the optimized BiVO4, Fe2O3/BiVO4, NiOOH/FeOOH/BiVO4, and NiOOH/FeOOH/Fe2O3/BiVO4 photoanodes exhibited obviously higher photocurrents of 1.34, 1.73, 2.11 and 2.69 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE under back-side illumination, respectively. According to previous reports,30 photoelectrons in BiVO4 have a short diffusion length of below 100 nm, and the thickness of BiVO4 in this paper was ∼150 nm (>100 nm). Thus, in the case of front-side illumination, large quantities of photo-generated electrons at the surface of the electrode would recombine and not reach the back-side FTO electrode. In addition, the photocurrents for all four BiVO4-based photoanodes increased after decorating with Fe2O3 and NiOOH/FeOOH, indicating their excellent hole transfer efficiency improvement.
The optical absorption behavior was also investigated using UV–vis absorbance spectroscopy in Fig. 5c. For all BiVO4-based photoanodes, the onset of light absorption was close at about 510 nm, which indicated that the bandgap energy didn't change after decorating with Fe2O3 and NiOOH/FeOOH. The optical absorptions for both Fe2O3/BiVO4 and NiOOH/FeOOH/BiVO4 photoanodes were slightly improved from 300 to 475 nm when compared with bare BiVO4. The improved optical absorption for Fe2O3/BiVO4 might be caused by the light absorption of the Fe2O3 layer. Considering that the NiOOH/FeOOH layer was only about 2 nm, the improved optical absorption for the NiOOH/FeOOH/BiVO4 photoanode might be attributed to the increased amount of optical trapping defects or the changes in surface roughness after depositing NiOOH/FeOOH.
The incident-photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was determined for these photoanodes under monochromatic light at 1.23 V vs. RHE and was given by the following equation:31 (1)where j is the photocurrent density, Pmono is the monochromatic illumination power intensity and λ is the incident light wavelength. The IPCE of Fe2O3/BiVO4 and NiOOH/FeOOH/BiVO4 photoanodes significantly improved from 300 to 500 nm when compared with the Fe2O3/BiVO4 photoanode, which suggested a remarkable improvement in the photo-oxidation process. In particular, the NiOOH/FeOOH/Fe2O3/BiVO4 photoanode exhibited the best IPCE value of 37.8% at 400 nm, which was highly enhanced compared with 12.2% for BiVO4 (Fig. 7).
3.3. Further analysis of the serial hole transfer layers
The results of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements are presented as Nyquist plots in Fig. 6a. The radius of the arc was related to the charge mobility behavior at the electrode/electrolyte interface of the photoanodes and a smaller radius suggested a better charge mobility.32,33 Under irradiation, the arc diameter of the NiOOH/FeOOH/BiVO4 sample was smaller than that of pristine BiVO4 (Fig. 6a), indicating that charge transport across the interface of NiOOH/FeOOH/BiVO4 and the electrolyte was more facile. Meanwhile, the Fe2O3/BiVO4 sample also exhibited a smaller arc diameter than the BiVO4 sample; this might be caused by the matched VB between Fe2O3 and BiVO4, which greatly promoted hole transport. Significantly, the NiOOH/FeOOH/Fe2O3/BiVO4 electrode demonstrated the smallest arc, suggesting the best hole transfer ability, which should be attributed to the simultaneous improved bulk/surface and surface/electrolyte hole transfer process by Fe2O3 and NiOOH/FeOOH layers, respectively. In addition, the result was consistent with LSV measurements.
 Fig. 6  (a) Nyquist EIS plots measured at 1.23 V vs. RHE and (b) Mott–Schottky plots of photoanodes measured at 1000 Hz under dark conditions. Solid lines were obtained by curve fitting. 
The Mott–Schottky plots of four different BiVO4 photoanodes were also measured under dark conditions with an applied frequency of 1000 Hz. Both the flat band potential and the carrier density of the photoanodes could be estimated using eqn (2):34 (2)in which CSC is the space charge capacitance, VE is the applied potential, VFB is the flat band potential of the electrode, k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, q is the electronic charge, ε is the dielectric constant of the electrode material, ε0 is the permittivity under vacuum, ND is the donor density, and A is the photoactive area.
The flat band potential (VFB) of the electrodes can be assessed from the intersection potential of the fitted tangent line and X axis (Fig. 6b). The VFB of BiVO4 and NiOOH/FeOOH/BiVO4 shifted positively by 17 mV and 61 mV after decorating with Fe2O3 layers, respectively, while it did not change regularly after depositing the FeOOH and NiOOH layers for BiVO4 and Fe2O3/BiVO4 photoanodes (Fig. 6b and Table S1†).
All four BiVO4 photoanodes showed a positive slope (Fig. 6b), indicating that the electrodes are n-type semiconductors, in which the holes acted as the minority carriers. In particular, the fitting line slope of the Mott–Schottky plots revealed the carrier density (ND) and a smaller slope means a higher carrier concentration. The slope got smaller for Fe2O3/BiVO4 and NiOOH/FeOOH/Fe2O3/BiVO4 photoanodes after decorating with Fe2O3 layers (Fig. 6b). In fact, the estimated ND values were about 3.45 and 3.39 times those of BiVO4 and NiOOH/FeOOH/BiVO4, respectively, suggesting that the Fe2O3 layer could effectively increase the carrier density for both BiVO4 and NiOOH/FeOOH/BiVO4. We inferred that more holes were transferred from BiVO4 bulk via Fe2O3 layers, therefore leading to less electron–hole recombination and larger ND values. On the other hand, the carrier concentration did not improve after depositing NiOOH/FeOOH layers (Fig. 6b and Table S1†), which was consistent with a previous report that the modification of the thin OEC layer should not change the doping level and carrier density.27
To confirm the charge separation effect after decorating with the serial hole transfer layers, the efficiency of charge transport both in the bulk (ηbulk) and at the surface (ηsurface) was investigated (Fig. 7). The charge transport efficiency could be established as follows: ηbulk = JNa2SO3/Jabs(3) ηsurface = JH2O/JNa2SO3(4)where Jabs is the photocurrent when the absorbed photons are totally converted into current, and JH2O and JNa2SO3 are the photocurrents for PEC H2O and Na2SO3 oxidation, respectively.
 Fig. 7  Charge separation efficiency (a) in the bulk (ηbulk) and (b) at the surface (ηsurface) of BiVO4-based photoanodes. 
The ηbulk of the bare BiVO4 photoanode was ∼48.3% at 1.23 V vs. RHE; after decorating with Fe2O3 layers, the ηbulk for both BiVO4 and NiOOH/FeOOH/BiVO4 photoanodes improved significantly, which revealed that the Fe2O3 layer could improve the charge transport in the bulk of BiVO4 (Fig. 7a). Particularly, the ηbulk of the NiOOH/FeOOH/Fe2O3/BiVO4 photoanode is up to ∼78.7% at 1.23 V vs. RHE, which was 1.63 times that of pristine BiVO4. On the other hand, the deposition of NiOOH/FeOOH did not obviously change the ηbulk of BiVO4.
To quantify the improvement of surface hole transfer kinetics, the ηsurface value, relating to surface hole transfer, was calculated as well (Fig. 7b). The ηsurface of the BiVO4 photoanode was only ∼27.2% at 1.23 V vs. RHE; both the Fe2O3 layer and the NiOOH/FeOOH layer could effectively improve the surface hole transfer efficiency. Notably, when NiOOH/FeOOH was deposited on the Fe2O3/BiVO4 photoanode, the ηsurface was further improved to 71.2% at 1.23 V vs. RHE, which was 2.62 times that of pristine BiVO4. In summary, the Fe2O3 layer simultaneously improved the bulk/surface and surface/electrolyte hole transfer, while the NiOOH/FeOOH layer highly improved the surface/electrolyte hole transfer but did not change the bulk/surface hole transfer.
For a deeper understanding of the hole transfer and recombination mechanism behind the photocurrent improvement after depositing Fe2O3 and NiOOH/FeOOH layers, further EIS measurements were carried out to extract charge transfer capacitances and resistances during the charge transfer process (Fig. 8). The corresponding equivalent circuit (EC) is shown in Fig. S11† for fitting EIS data obtained from 0.6 to 1.3 V vs. RHE under irradiation. The circuit contained a resistance in the photoanode (Rbulk) and a capacitance in the bulk of the photoanode (Cbulk), a charge transfer resistance at the electrode surface (Rsurface), a capacitance corresponding to the electrode/electrolyte interface (Csurface) and the series resistances in the PEC cell (Rs).
 Fig. 8  Trend of capacitances and resistances associated with the bulk BiVO4 electrode (Cbulk, Rbulk) and charge transfer at the electrode surface (Csurface, Rsurface) with different potentials for different samples (BiVO4, Fe2O3/BiVO4, NiOOH/FeOOH/BiVO4, NiOOH/FeOOH/Fe2O3/BiVO4) obtained by fitting their equivalent circuits (Fig. S11†). 
In this case, a larger Cbulk indicated a higher charge-transfer capacitance in the bulk of BiVO4, while a smaller Rbulk suggested a lower charge-transfer resistance in the BiVO4. The fitting results showed that the Fe2O3 layer substantially improved the charge-transfer capacitance and decreased the charge-transfer resistance in the bulk of BiVO4 (Fig. 8a and c), which revealed that the existence of a Fe2O3 layer could significantly enhance the bulk/surface hole transfer process in the bulk of BiVO4. In contrast, decorating with NiOOH/FeOOH hardly changed the capacitance and resistance in the bulk of BiVO4 (Fig. 8a and c), which was consistent with the charge separation efficiency result in Fig. 7a.
For the charge transfer capacitance and resistance at the surface of the electrode, both Fe2O3 and NiOOH/FeOOH layers could significantly improve the Csurface and decrease the Rsurface compared with bare BiVO4, suggesting that both layers could promote the charge transfer at the electrode surface separately. Still, the NiOOH/FeOOH/Fe2O3/BiVO4 photoanode exhibited the best charge transfer property (Csurface was about 1.59 times that of the Fe2O3/BiVO4 photoanode at 1.23 V vs. RHE), which revealed that modifying the NiOOH/FeOOH layer could further enhance the surface/electrolyte hole transfer. In summary, the NiOOH/FeOOH/Fe2O3/BiVO4 photoanode demonstrated the best charge transfer property both in the bulk and the electrode surface of the electrode via the serial hole transfer layers.
To investigate how the dynamics of the photogenerated holes was affected by serial hole transfer layers, transient photocurrent (TPC) and transient photovoltage (TPV) measurements (for more detailed information see the ESI†) were also performed for BiVO4 photoanodes with and without serial hole transfer layers (Fig. 9 and Table S2†), which could directly reveal the lifetimes of the trapped holes and the hole separation and recombination efficiency.35–37 Both the TPC and TPV signals could be illustrated in terms of two time constants (τ1 and τ2) and probability constants (φ1 and φ2).
 Fig. 9  (a) Transient photocurrent and (b) transient photovoltage for the BiVO4 electrode prepared with and without serial hole transfer layers. 
Considering that the charge lifetime was very short, adding the transfer layers should usually increase the charge transfer distance, which was unfavorable for the photocatalytic performance. However, the average decay times (s) were 3.12 and 1.24 ms at 1.23 V vs. RHE for BiVO4 and NiOOH/FeOOH/Fe2O3/BiVO4 photoanodes, respectively (Table S2†), indicating that the lifetime of the NiOOH/FeOOH/Fe2O3/BiVO4 photoanode was about 2.54 times that of the pristine BiVO4 photoanode without serial hole transfer. The increased hole lifetime could be ascribed to the formation of serial hole transfer layers, which effectively enhanced the hole transfer efficiency during water oxidation. The measurements of hole lifetime and hole separation and recombination behavior further proved that the serial hole transfer layers indeed improved the hole lifetime and alleviated electron/hole pair recombination for the NiOOH/FeOOH/Fe2O3/BiVO4 photoanode.
3.4. The performances of the self-bias PEC water-splitting device

Fig. 10a presents a schematic diagram of a typical self-bias PEC water-splitting device driven by solar energy alone. To fabricate a complete water-splitting device without externally applied potential, we combined the as-prepared NiOOH/FeOOH/Fe2O3/BiVO4 photoanode with a monocrystal commercial PV solar cell behind via a copper wire to constitute a composite electrode. Then, the PEC water-splitting device was fabricated as a two-electrode system by using the as-prepared composite electrode as the working electrode, and Pt black as the counter electrode in 0.1 mol L−1 sodium sulfate (Na2SO4) electrolyte. In this system, high energy photons were absorbed by the front NiOOH/FeOOH/Fe2O3/BiVO4 photoanode, while low energy photons which passed through the photoanode were absorbed by the back Si PVC, which can generate additional photopotential to drive the charge transfer. The photogenerated holes from the NiOOH/FeOOH/Fe2O3/BiVO4 photoanode had enough energy (∼2.6 eV vs. NHE) to overcome the thermodynamics (1.23 eV vs. NHE) and overpotential for splitting H2O to O2 at the photoanode/electrolyte interface.38 Meanwhile, the low-energy electrons from the NiOOH/FeOOH/Fe2O3/BiVO4 photoanode were elevated by the Si PVC to overcome the thermodynamics and polarization loss for reducing H+ to H2 at the Pt black/electrolyte interface. Finally, both hydrogen and oxygen generation was enhanced in the integrated PEC configuration. The corresponding charge transfer diagram and the characterization system for the PEC water splitting configuration are shown in Fig. S11 and S12.†

(b) J–V curves measured in a two-electrode system under AM 1.5G illumination. The red dots stand for the NiOOH/FeOOH/Fe2O3/BiVO4 photoanode without the PVC. The violet, purple and olive dots shown in (a) are the J–V curves of bi-cell, tri-cell and tetra-cell Si solar cells (checked behind the NiOOH/FeOOH/Fe2O3/BiVO4 photoanode). The intersection of the NiOOH/FeOOH/Fe2O3/BiVO4 curve with different a-Si curves indicates the operating current density and the operating potential of the combined water-splitting device, respectively. (c) The long-term current versus time (J–t) curve and gas evolution rates for H2 and O2 of the final PEC device. The electrolyte used is 0.1 M sodium sulfate (pH 7). 

Fig. 10b and c show the PEC performances of a self-bias PEC water-splitting device measured under AM 1.5G illumination using a two-electrode system. Since the photoanode and the PV are stacked in a series-connected way, the photovoltage will rise, while the net photocurrent will be the minimum one, which is a bottleneck for the self-bias PEC water-splitting device.39 For optimal performance, we measured the J–V curves of different α-Si PV cells to match the J–V curve of the NiOOH/FeOOH/Fe2O3/BiVO4 photoanode, and the Tetra-cell Si PV solar cell showed the best photocurrent of ∼2.65 mA cm−2 for the point of intersection (Fig. 10b). Based on the intersection, an operating photocurrent could be predicted for the PEC system. It should be mentioned that the difference of the J–V curves of two-electrode and three-electrode measurements for the NiOOH/FeOOH/Fe2O3/BiVO4 photoanode is caused by the different nature of the measurement.40 The long-term current versus time (J–t) curve for the self-bias system is also shown in Fig. 10c, and a stable photocurrent density of ∼2.60 mA cm−2 without additional bias was achieved, which was consistent with the photocurrent at the intersection (Fig. 10b). In addition, the stability did not decrease after placing PVC on the back of the NiOOH/FeOOH/Fe2O3/BiVO4 photoanode. According to the equation STH (%) = 1.23 × Jop (mA cm−2)/P (P is the power of the illuminating light),39,41 the STH efficiency for the self-bias PEC water-splitting system was estimated to be ∼3.2%. Finally, the O2 and H2 evolution rates were also demonstrated for the self-bias PEC system in Fig. 10c, which were approximately 49.5 and 25.1 μmol cm−2 h−1, respectively.
4. Conclusions
In summary, we demonstrated a high-performance BiVO4 photoanode deposited with serial hole transfer layers of Fe2O3 and NiOOH/FeOOH for self-sustaining solar PEC water splitting. The results showed that the Fe2O3 layer simultaneously improved the bulk/surface and surface/electrolyte hole transfer, while other hole transfer layers of NiOOH/FeOOH significantly decreased the resistance at the electrode surface and further improved the surface/electrolyte hole transfer. Due to the existence of Fe2O3 and NiOOH/FeOOH serial hole transfer layers, the photocurrent was up to 2.24 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE, which was about 2.95 times that of the pristine BiVO4 photoanode. Meanwhile, the charge transport efficiencies in the bulk (ηbulk) and the surface (ηsurface) were enhanced by 1.63 and 2.62 times than those of the BiVO4 photoanode at 1.23 V vs. RHE, respectively. In addition, the novel photoanode was assembled with a commercial silicon PVC for self-bias PEC water splitting, and a stable photocurrent density of ∼2.60 mA cm−2, corresponding to a ∼3.2% STH conversion efficiency, was achieved spontaneously. Finally, the serial hole transfer strategy can provide a new pathway to improve the charge transfer of photoanodes for the self-bias PEC water-splitting system.
