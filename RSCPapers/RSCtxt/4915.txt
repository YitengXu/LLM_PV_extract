    , Accepted 20th October 2016First published on 21st October 2016AbstractFour types of nanostructural WO3/BiVO4 heterojunctions were designed by depositing a BiVO4 layer onto WO3 scaffolds with different morphologies and investigated to understand the influence of heterojunction morphology on their photoelectrochemical performances. The architecture of WO3 scaffolds was controlled by adjusting the solvents used in their solvothermal synthesis. The solvent was found to exert a great influence on the architecture of the obtained WO3 scaffolds. Methanol leads to the formation of block-like nanostructures and ethanol facilitates the formation of nanorods, while isopropyl alcohol and ethylene glycol give rise to the formation of triangular nanowalls and 3D hierarchical nanostructures, respectively. Monoclinic WO3 nanostructures were obtained via removal of ammonium or structural water by annealing the samples obtained at 510 °C in air. A BiVO4 layer was then deposited on the monoclinic WO3 scaffolds with different morphologies by spin-coating to form WO3/BiVO4 heterojunction films, which show significantly enhanced photocurrents compared to their corresponding bare WO3 scaffolds. Among these WO3/BiVO4 nanostructure heterojunctions, the one based on a rod-like WO3 nanostructure shows the best photoelectrochemical (PEC) performance, which can be ascribed to its optimal rod-like morphology, for the construction of WO3/BiVO4 heterojunction regarding efficient charge carrier transfer and collection, while the other one based on WO3 nanowalls exhibits better stability and a higher photocurrent in a long-run test, indicating that morphology engineering significantly influences the activity and stability of WO3-based heterojunctions.
1. Introduction
Photoelectrochemical water splitting has been considered as one of the most promising green technologies for energy conversion and environmental remediation since the report of n-type TiO2 as a photoanode for solar hydrogen generation.1 So far, various metal oxide semiconductors, such as titanium dioxide (TiO2), zinc oxide (ZnO) and bismuth vanadate (BiVO4)2–10 have been explored as photoelectrochemical photoanodes because of their non-toxicity, low cost and relatively good stability in aqueous electrolyte. As a semiconductor with a moderate bandgap, tungsten trioxide (WO3) has drawn much attention in potential applications for photoelectrochemical water splitting due to its great electrical properties and high photocatalytic activity.11 In recent years, many predominant strategies have been extensively investigated to improve the photoactivity of tungsten trioxide and these techniques were used to improve light harvesting, charge separation and utilization efficiency to achieve a superior photoelectrochemical performance. For morphology tuning, it was reported that an optimized morphology of photoanode material could facilitate an accelerated mass transportation and improved light harvesting as well as efficient charge collection and separation and thus enhanced PEC performance of photocatalytic materials.12 So far, various WO3 nanostructures, such as nanowires/nanorods, nanoplates/nanoflakes, hierarchical nanostructures and other typical morphologies, have been fabricated and tested for photoelectrochemical water oxidation applications. In our previous research studies, WO3 vertically aligned nanoflake arrays and hierarchical architecture of WO3 nanosheets were synthesized via a solvothermal technique, which yields a considerable photocurrent value at approximately 1.4 mA cm−2 (1.23 V versus RHE) and 1.25 mA cm−2 (1.3 V versus Ag/AgCl), respectively.13,14 Joo and co-workers synthesized oriented WO3 nanorods by a facile hydrothermal method and the optimized WO3 nanorod arrays exhibit a photocurrent of 2.26 mA cm−2 (1.23 V versus RHE).15 Yang et al. fabricated a uniform tungsten trioxide hydrate (WO3·H2O) plate-like array film on FTO that exhibits a higher activity (4.13 mA cm−2 at 1.6 V vs. Ag/AgCl, 0.5 M H2SO4 as electrolyte).16 A 3D tree-like nanoporous WO3 photoanode was prepared using a pulsed laser deposition method that largely improved the photoelectrochemical water oxidation performance.17 Notably, WO3 nanoplate arrays with (002) oriented facets prepared via a 2-step hydrothermal method were reported by Wang et al., which exhibit unprecedented photoelectrochemical performance with a remarkable photocurrent density of 3.7 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE without the use of any cocatalyst.18 Zheng et al. developed a post growth modification method of two-dimensional WO3 nanoflakes by a simultaneous solution etching and reducing process, which show an enhanced photocurrent density compared to the pristine WO3.19 In addition, atomic structure regulation by introduction of oxygen vacancies has drawn much attention. Wang et al. synthesized hydrogen-treated WO3 nanoflakes that showed an order of magnitude enhancement in photocurrent and stability.20 A similar study showing that substoichiometric WOx exhibits a dramatically enhanced photocatalytic performance has also been reported by Yan and co-workers.21 Li et al. presented a highly competitive dark blue tungsten oxide (WO2.9) converted from commercial WO3via a facile thermal treatment, which exhibits excellent catalytic activity for electrochemical hydrogen evolution.22 In the past decade, significant research interest was focused on the construction of heterojunctions to improve the solar energy conversion efficiency of WO3 due to its effective charge transfer and charge separation and enhanced light-trapping absorption.23–25 One of the best candidates for heterojunction construction with WO3 is BiVO4, whose bandgap is 2.4 eV (ref. 10 and 26) and whose band edge positions are well-matched with that of WO3.
Since the first report on WO3/BiVO4 thin films for photoelectrochemical applications by P. Chatchai and co-workers,27 substantial efforts have been made to improve the PEC properties of WO3/BiVO4 heterojunction. In our previous work, we reported a nanostructured WO3/BiVO4 based on WO3 nanorods by a simple solvothermal deposition and spin-coating technique.28 The double-decker WO3/BiVO4 inverse opal photoanodes prepared by swelling–shrinking mediated polystyrene template synthetic routes were reported to have a photocurrent density of ∼3.3 mA cm−2 (1.23 V vs. RHE).29 Another similar architecture of WO3/(W, Mo)-BiVO4/FeOOH/NiOOH achieved an outstanding photocurrent density of about 5.35 mA cm−2 (1.23 V vs. RHE).30 With a better conformation of the BiVO4 ETA layer, WO3/BiVO4 + CoPi core–shell nanostructures could produce a photocurrent of a record 6.72 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE for a WO3-based composite electrode.31 Moreover, other WO3-based heterojunctions, such as WO3/TiO2,23 WO3/Fe2O3 (ref. 25), WO3/MWO4 (M = Cu and Zn) etc.,32–34 have also received considerable attention. Yet none of these materials shows a photoactivity comparable to that of WO3/BiVO4 nanostructures. However, among various reported nanostructured WO3/BiVO4 heterojunctions, 1D rod-like WO3 was usually used as base material to construct heterojunctions, while there are very few heterojunctions based on WO3 with other morphologies, such as nanowalls or hierarchical nanostructures.
In this paper, four different WO3 nanostructures were successfully obtained by a facile solvothermal synthesis method followed by thermal annealing. Different organic solvents, such as methanol, ethanol, isopropyl alcohol and ethylene glycol (EG), adopted as solvothermal precursors, make a great contribution to the formation of different WO3 nanostructures. These WO3 nanostructures were used to investigate the influence of WO3 scaffold morphology on the photoelectrochemical performance of WO3/BiVO4 heterojunctions. The obtained WO3/BiVO4 heterojunctions with different morphologies were characterized using XRD, SEM, HRTEM, AFM and XPS to demonstrate the relationship between morphology and photoelectrochemical properties in nanostructured WO3/BiVO4 composites. This work provides an experimental and theoretical basis for the design and fabrication of semiconductor heterojunctions with optimal morphology for water-oxidation applications.
2. Experimental
2.1. Preparation of WO3 scaffold with different morphologies

2.1.1. Preparation of peroxo-polytungstic acid solution as precursor for solvothermal deposition. 
A peroxo-polytungstic acid solution with a W concentration of 0.1 M for solvothermal reaction was obtained by dissolving 2.5 g tungstic acid in a mixed solution containing 50 ml of water and 50 ml of H2O2 (30%) with vigorous stirring in an oil bath at about 98 °C. After complete dissolution, the resulting clear solution was diluted using deionized water to a molar concentration of 0.1 M (100 mL).


2.1.2. Solvothermal deposition. 
0.3 g of (NH4)2SO4 was added to 50 mL of mixed solvent composed of organic solvent (methanol, ethanol, isopropyl alcohol or ethylene glycol) and deionized water with the volume ratio of 40:10 with vigorous stirring to form a mixed suspension solution; the acidity of this suspension solution was adjusted using a concentrated (6 M) hydrochloric acid solution to obtain a transparent solution. After that, 5 ml of as-prepared peroxo-polytungstic acid solution with a concentration of 0.1 M was added into the transparent solution. Then, the FTO substrate (2 cm × 4.5 cm) with a WO3 seed layer (coated by spin-coating at 3000 rpm for 20 s and annealed at 450 °C) was placed in a Teflon liner against the inner wall at an angle of about 45°. After the prepared precursor (∼60 ml) for solvothermal deposition was transferred into the Teflon liner, the autoclave was sealed and kept in an oven at 200 °C for 5 hours. The as-prepared samples were further annealed at 510 °C in a muffle furnace for 2 hours at a rate of ∼3.3 °C min−1 to be transformed to monoclinic WO3 samples.

2.2. Fabrication of WO3/BiVO4 heterojunction photoelectrodes

2.2.1. Preparation of BiVO4 solution for spin-coating. 
First, 1.17 g of NH4VO3 was dissolved in 30 ml of HNO3 aqueous solution (containing 10 ml 65 wt% HNO3 solution and 20 ml of deionized water) with stirring for half an hour. Then 4.85 g of Bi(NO3)3 was dissolved in the solution by vigorous stirring at room temperature and a yellow-colored BiVO4 solution with a molar concentration of 0.33 M was formed. After that 1.92 g of citric acid was introduced into the yellow solution to obtain a blue solution. 6 ml of this blue-colored BiVO4 solution was mixed with 2 ml of PVA solution (5 g in 100 ml) and then the mixed solution were treated with ultrasonic agitation for a few minutes to obtain the precursor for spin-coating.


2.2.2. Deposition of BiVO4 layer on the WO3 nanostructures with different morphologies. 
The BiVO4 layer was deposited on the hydrothermally prepared WO3 film substrate (2 cm × 2.25 cm) by spin coating with 100 μL of 0.33 M spin-coating solution at 3000 rpm for 30 s followed by a drying step at 80 °C for 10 min. Subsequently, this spin-coating and drying process was repeated a second time. Finally, the spin-coated samples were annealed at 480 °C for 2 h in air with a heating rate of 4 °C min−1.

2.3. Characterization
The surface morphology, structural analysis and optical properties of the obtained WO3 films and corresponding WO3/BiVO4 nanostructures were characterized by X-ray diffraction technique (XRD, CuKα, 40 kV, 40 mA, PANalytical Corp), scanning electron microscopy (SEM, model JSM-7800), UV-vis spectrophotometry (CHTACHI U-4100) and atomic force microscopy (SPM-Solver NEXT AFM system, NT-MDT, Russia). The photoelectrochemical testing system was examined using three-electrode cells (Pt/(Ag/AgCl)/sample-FTO), WO3 films and BiVO4/WO3 heterojunctions grown on FTO substrate as working electrode; platinum and Ag/AgCl electrodes were used as counter and reference electrodes, respectively. 0.5 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution was taken as an electrolyte. Photocurrent densities were measured using a CHI 760D scanning potentiostat (CH Instruments). The scanning rate was 10 mV s−1, and the scanning direction was from low to high potential. A 500 W xenon lamp coupled with an AM 1.5 filter was used as the light source. The light intensity was set at 100 mW cm−2. According to the Nernst equation:18ERHE = EAg/AgCl + 0.059 pH + E0Ag/AgCl
the measured potentials vs. Ag/AgCl can be converted to reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) scale. The value of E0Ag/AgCl is 0.197 V at room temperature and the pH value of 0.5 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution was measured to be about 7.0. Thus the above equation can be described as follows:ERHE = EAg/AgCl + 0.61
3. Results and discussion
Four different alcohol agents, methanol, ethanol, isopropyl alcohol and ethylene glycol (EG), were selected as solvothermal solvents to fabricate the WO3 with various morphologies. Fig. 1 shows SEM images of as-prepared samples and their corresponding annealed samples synthesized using different organic alcohols as hydrothermal solvents. As shown in Fig. 1a, when methanol was used as the solvent, block-like structures made of massive nanoblocks were formed, which possess a smooth surface and a thickness of ∼0.3–2 μm. Its morphology was found unchanged after annealing in 510 °C, as shown in Fig. 1e. As shown in Fig. 1b, the ethanol solvent makes nanorods with shorter length and larger diameter after a 510 °C calcination, which are shown in the Fig. 1f.
 Fig. 1  SEM images of as-prepared samples and corresponding annealed WO3 samples synthesized with different organic alcohols as hydrothermal solvent: methanol (a and e); ethanol (b and f); isopropyl alcohol (c and g) and ethylene glycol (d and h). 
When isopropyl alcohol was adopted as the solvent, two-dimensional nanowalls with a thickness of 300–500 nm were obtained (Fig. 1c) and the triangular wall-like morphology was maintained after calcination even though the surface became rather rough (Fig. 1g). As can be seen from Fig. 1d and h, when ethylene glycol (EG) was applied as the solvent for the solvothermal reaction, 3D hierarchical nanostructures made up of nanosheets and nanorods were grown. This structure was composed of nanorods with a length of 300 nm–1 μm orthogonally attaching on the nanosheets at two sides, and this morphology showed no clear changes after a 510 °C calcination except for its smoother edges (Fig. 1d and h). The obtained four annealed WO3 samples prepared with four kinds of alcohol as solvent were denoted as M-WO3 (methanol as solvent), E-WO3 (ethanol as solvent), I-WO3 (isopropyl alcohol as solvent) and EG-WO3 (ethylene glycol as solvent).
The XRD patterns of as-prepared samples are shown in Fig. 2a. It can be seen that almost all diffraction peaks of the four as-prepared samples are indexed as the hexagonal ammonium tungsten bronze phase of (NH4)0.33·WO3 with a lattice spacing of a = 7.3920 Å, b = 7.3920 Å, c = 7.5120 Å and γ = 120° (JCPDS00-042-0452), while a second phase was found according to the peak located at about 18.08° observed for all samples which can be indexed to the (111) plane of tungsten hydrate WO3·(H2O)x (JCPDS01-087-1203). After heat treatment, the hexagonal ammonium tungsten bronze and tungsten hydrate were converted to the monoclinic WO3 (a = 7.3008 Å, b = 7.5389 Å, c = 7.6896 Å and β = 90.8920°, JCPDS01-083-0950) with a dominant diffraction peak of the (200) plane as shown in Fig. 2b.
 Fig. 2  (a) XRD patterns of as-prepared samples and (b) the corresponding annealed WO3 samples synthesized with different organic alcohols as hydrothermal solvent. 
The photoelectrochemical performance of the above-mentioned four annealed WO3 samples was tested and is displayed in Fig. 3a.
 Fig. 3  Photoelectrochemical properties of WO3 nanostructures with different morphologies: (a) current–potential curves under AM 1.5 illumination and (b) EIS Nyquist plots and fitted profiles carried at a bias of 1.41 V (vs. RHE) under AM 1.5 irradiation. 
The WO3 samples prepared with ethanol (E-WO3) and isopropyl alcohol (I-WO3) as reaction solvent show a very close photocurrent value of ∼0.8 mA cm−2 at 1.41 V (vs. RHE), which is higher than the photocurrent value of ∼0.7 mA cm−2 and 0.4 mA cm−2 at 1.41 V versus RHE for samples prepared with ethylene glycol (EG-WO3) and methanol (M-WO3) as solvent, respectively. The higher PEC performance can be attributed to the more efficient charger transfer of one-dimensional nanorods and triangular nanowall structures, which can be confirmed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) carried out at 1.41 V (vs. RHE) under illumination to study the interface charge transport behaviour of the obtained four WO3 nanostructures (Fig. 3b). A smaller arc radius was found for both E-WO3 and I-WO3 as compared to EG-WO3 and M-WO3, reflected by the minimum R (Fig. S1b†) calculated by fitting the data with an equivalent circuit model shown in Fig. S1a.† A smaller arc radius is a result of better interfacial charge transfer, and enhanced photoelectrochemical performances are obtained for E-WO3 and I-WO3 samples. Based on these results, it is clearly demonstrated that the surface morphology of nanostructures have an important influence on their photoelectrochemical properties.
As has been reported, solvothermal growth conditions, such as different additives, dopants and pH value, have been adjusted to obtain WO3 nanostructures with various morphologies.35–37 Recently, WO3 with different morphologies, nanoplates, nanorods and micro crystals, were prepared using different pH values in the growth solution to construct a novel WO3/Sb2S3 heterojunction for enhanced photoelectrochemical application.38 In this work, WO3 nanostructures with different morphologies were synthesized by solely adjusting the solvent in the hydrothermal process for constructing nanostructured WO3/BiVO4 heterojunctions.
The formation processes and synthetic routes of WO3 nanoblocks, WO3 nanorods, WO3 nanowalls and 3D hierarchical WO3 nanostructures by adjusting the solvent and their corresponding WO3/BiVO4 heterojunction structures are summarized in Fig. 4. As shown in the schematic illustration, tungstate as W source and ammonium sulphate as capping agent were used at the first hydrothermal step. To the best of our knowledge, with the help of H+, the following chemical reaction of WO3 nuclei formation would take place easily when H2WO4 or WO42− is used as the W source:WO42− + 2H+ → WO3 + H2O
NH4+, however, acts as a capping ion to guide the growth of WO3 crystals with the assistance of a hydroxyl functional group (–OH) in the alcohols. When methanol was used as solvent, no significant anisotropic growth was observed for ammonium tungsten bronze and thus block-like structures were obtained, while in ethanol, anisotropic growth is enhanced and nanorod arrays were grown. In an alcohol solvent with a longer carbon chain, the nanorods would self-assemble to form 2D triangular nanowalls. When ethylene glycol, containing two hydroxyl groups, was introduced as solvent in the hydrothermal reaction, both nanosheets and nanorods were grown, forming a 3D hierarchical nanostructure. Therefore, by selecting organic alcohols containing different carboxyl functional structures in the hydrothermal process, various WO3 nanostructures with morphologies from 1D nanorods to 3D hierarchical nanostructures can be synthesized, which shows that the chemical structures of hydroxyl groups plays a key role in guiding the crystal growth and thus leads to formation of different WO3 nanostructures.
 Fig. 4  Schematic illustration of the synthetic route of WO3 nanostructures with different morphologies using methanol, ethanol, isopropyl alcohol and ethylene glycol as hydrothermal solvent, respectively, and corresponding WO3/BiVO4 heterojunction structures prepared by a spin-coating method. 
The significant influence of morphology on the photocatalytic activity of WO3 nanostructures has been confirmed in several reports.39–42 These reports investigated the influence of the shape and size distribution of nanoparticles, the surface roughness, the thickness and the orientation of nanostructures on the photocatalytic properties. In this article, WO3 nanostructures with different morphologies were prepared and the influence of their dimensional difference on the photoelectrochemical performance was carefully studied. Then, to further investigate the WO3 nanostructure morphology effect on the photoelectrochemical performance of WO3-based heterojunctions, a BiVO4 layer was deposited on the different WO3 nanostructures to form four types of WO3/BiVO4 heterojunctions. The obtained heterojunctions deposited using M-WO3, E-WO3, I-WO3 and EG-WO3 as scaffolds were labeled M-WO3/BiVO4, E-WO3/BiVO4, I-WO3/BiVO4 and EG-WO3/BiVO4, respectively.

Fig. 5 shows the top-view and cross-sectional view SEM images, TEM and HRTEM images of nanostructured WO3/BiVO4 heterojunctions based on the various WO3 nanostructures with a 480 °C calcination. According to the top-view images shown in Fig. 5a–d, it is clearly shown that the surface of WO3 for all samples was covered by the BiVO4 particles with a diameter of about 30–50 nm, which is a similar morphology to the spin-coated bare BiVO4 on FTO shown in Fig. S2a.† In addition, as the WO3 nanostructures were covered by a thin BiVO4 grain layer, no morphological change was observed compared to their corresponding bare WO3 nanostructures.
 Fig. 5  Top-view (a–d) and corresponding cross-sectional view (e–h) SEM images, TEM and HRTEM images (i–l) of prepared WO3/BiVO4 heterojunctions based on WO3 scaffolds with different morphologies. 
As can be seen from the cross-sectional view images in Fig. 5e–h, the I-WO3/BiVO4 photoanodes composed of WO3 nanowalls and BiVO4 particles show a maximum thickness of approximately 4.0–5.0 μm (Fig. 5g) due to their triangular nanostructures with larger width, while the M-WO3/BiVO4 and E-WO3/BiVO4 samples are made up of WO3 nanostructures with block-like and short rod-like morphologies, respectively, coupled with BiVO4 particles to reach a height of ∼2.5 μm (Fig. 5e and f). Dense 3D hierarchical WO3 structures with a thickness of ∼2 μm were covered with BiVO4 particles to fabricate the EG-WO3/BiVO4 heterojunction photoanodes. The WO3/BiVO4 heterojunction nanostructures based on different WO3 morphologies have been further identified by the TEM images shown in Fig. 5i–l. Clearly, nanoblocks (Fig. 5i), nanorods (Fig. 5j), triangular nanowalls (Fig. 5k) and hierarchical nanostructures (Fig. 5l) were fabricated via a hydrothermal route by the use of different solvents and a small amount of BiVO4 layer was found to be deposited on the surface of WO3 nanostructures by spin-coating. The HRTEM analyses were performed at the heterojunction region marked with red rectangles and clear lattice crystal planes with a fringe spacing of 0.309 nm, 0.233 nm, 0.213 nm and 0.310 nm in the BiVO4 layer and 0.383 nm, 0.300 nm, 0.377 nm and 0.267 nm in the WO3 scaffolds shown in the insets of Fig. 5i–l can be observed in all four samples, which is well matched with the monoclinic BiVO4 and WO3, respectively.
In order to quantitatively determine the variation of the surface morphologies of the four types of WO3/BiVO4 nanostructures, the 2D and 3D morphology observation was carried out using an AFM system (SemiContact mode, scanning rate 0.5 Hz). The 2D AFM images (Fig. S3†) of four samples reveal surface morphologies similar to those of the corresponding SEM images shown in Fig. 5a–d. The peak-to-valley height and valley-to-valley width of the 3D AFM profile shown in Fig. 6 demonstrate the clear morphological difference between the four WO3/BiVO4 samples. According to the values shown in Table 1, the root mean square (Sq, RMS) of samples M-WO3/BiVO4, E-WO3/BiVO4, I-WO3/BiVO4 and EG-WO3/BiVO4 are around 262 nm, 235 nm, 290 nm and 116 nm, respectively, which reveals relatively rough surface morphologies for all heterojunction samples, and the sample I-WO3/BiVO4 shows a higher roughness. These various roughness values of the WO3/BiVO4 heterojunction may be of interest for possible photocatalytic applications. When the BiVO4 layer was introduced to the surface of WO3 scaffolds with different morphologies, the degree of surface roughness, reflected by the root mean square (Sq, RMS), would have affected the amount of BiVO4 particle deposited on the surface of WO3 scaffolds by spin-coating method and thus induced the difference in performance in different heterojunction structures.

The crystal structures of the prepared WO3/BiVO4 heterojunction samples using different WO3 nanostructures as scaffolds were further investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) as shown in Fig. 7b. The dominant peaks correspond to the diffraction from monoclinic WO3 for all BiVO4/WO3 samples, while a very weak peak that appeared at about 18.7° (a magnification of the XRD patterns in the 16–20° 2θ region is marked in Fig. 7a) is identical to the diffraction of monoclinic BiVO4 structures (JCPDS01-075-1867). The weak diffraction peak of BiVO4 structures is due to their small quantity and small crystalline size, which is consistent with the results reported by Grigioni.43 The XRD patterns of bare BiVO4 layer deposited on the FTO via the same spin-coating method is shown in Fig. S2b† for comparison, which is well matched with that deposited on the surface of WO3 nanostructures.
 Fig. 7  (a) Magnification of XRD patterns in the 16–20 degrees 2θ region. (b) XRD patterns of the prepared WO3/BiVO4 heterojunctions based on WO3 nanostructures with different morphologies. 
UV-vis absorption (A = 100 − R − T) spectrum and Tauc plots for all WO3 samples with different morphologies and their corresponding WO3/BiVO4 nanostructures are shown in Fig. S4.† Clearly, the BiVO4 coatings decreased the band edges of WO3 samples with different morphologies according to Fig. S4a,† which is attributed to the smaller bandgap of the BiVO4 layer. The optical bandgap can be extracted from transmittance and reflectance spectra using the Tauc plot method in the following equation:44αhν = A(hν − Eg)nwhere h is Planck's constant, ν is the frequency of light, A is a constant, and n equals 2 for an allowed indirect transition or 1/2 for an allowed direct transition, Eg is the bandgap energy and α is the absorption coefficient. According to the Tauc plots shown in Fig. S4b,† different bandgaps were observed for those bare WO3 scaffolds, which are 2.59 eV, 2.61 eV, 2.63 eV and 2.65 eV for the samples of I-WO3, EG-WO3, E-WO3 and M-WO3, respectively, indicating that the different light-harvesting capabilities of WO3 nanostructures originated from their different surface morphologies, while all the WO3/BiVO4 heterojunction samples show a very close bandgap value of ∼2.45 eV, originating from the BiVO4 top layer, which reveals that the introduced BiVO4 layer determined the light absorption of the WO3/BiVO4 heterojunction.
PL spectra recorded using an excitation wavelength of 377 nm for WO3/BiVO4 nanostructures and their bare WO3 scaffolds with different morphologies are shown in Fig. S5.† For all samples, two peaks centered at approximately 435 nm and 465 nm can be observed in an intense broad emission band ranging from 430 nm to 480 nm. This blue emission band might be ascribed to emission from the band-to-band recombination of the photo-excited electrons in the conduction band and valence band.45,46 However, the observed PL intensity of WO3/BiVO4is much weaker than that of bare WO3 nanostructures, which could be due to the covering of BiVO4 with no PL emission on the WO3 nanostructures.
The XPS technique was conducted to identify the chemical composition of the obtained WO3/BiVO4 heterojunctions. From the fitted XPS spectrum shown in Fig. 8, the W4f and Bi4f core level spectra can be observed clearly for all samples. The W4f peaks at about 35.7 eV and 37.8 eV can be assigned to W6+ 4f7/2 and 4f5/2, respectively. Obviously, two XPS peaks were also identified by fitting the Bi4f peak located at about 159.2 eV and 164.5 eV, which are confirmed to be the main oxidation states of Bi3+ in BiVO4 compound,27,47,48 corresponding to 4f7/2 and 4f5/2, respectively. In addition, the XPS peaks of V2p at 516.8 eV and 524.2 eV observed in the XPS spectrum are shown in Fig. S6a–d,† which are assigned to V2p3/2 and V2p1/2, respectively, and it can be concluded that the V in the composite is in the 5+ oxidation state according to the reported results.49,50 These results indicate that no elemental composition and valence state change were observed in different WO3/BiVO4 heterojunctions.

Among them, the M-WO3/BiVO4 heterojunction showed the highest photocurrent improvement of 2.5 times compared to that of its pristine M-WO3 scaffold (from ∼0.44 mA cm−2 to 1.1 mA cm2 at 1.41 V vs. RHE) as shown in Fig. 3a. For the samples E-WO3 and I-WO3, their photocurrents were doubled after depositing a BiVO4 layer to form WO3/BiVO4 heterojunctions. The smallest improvement of photocurrent is for the EG-WO3/BiVO4 sample with 1.78 times. This improvement of photoelectrochemical activity for the WO3/BiVO4 nanostructures compared to their corresponding WO3 scaffolds can be attributed to the enhanced photo absorption and improved charge separation due to the type II stepwise band edge structure.24,28,51 When excluding the effect of light absorption, the improvement in photoelectrochemical activity also benefits from these WO3/BiVO4 hetrojunction structures compared to those of their corresponding WO3 scaffolds. These benefits can be derived from the different surface morphologies and surface roughness between these four types of WO3 scaffolds, including the different charge transfer processes and distribution of activity sites for the photoelectrochemical reaction. Compared to the other three samples, I-WO3/BiVO4, M-WO3/BiVO4 and EG-WO3/BiVO4, fabricated based on WO3 scaffolds with morphologies of nanowalls, nanoblocks and 3D hierarchical nanostructures, respectively, the E-BiVO4/WO3 sample fabricated based on WO3nanorods gives the best photocurrent of 1.6 mA cm−2 (1.41 V vs. RHE) as shown in Fig. 9a, which might result from its rod-like nanocomposite as the optimal scaffold for the construction of E-WO3/BiVO4 heterojunction regarding efficient charge carrier transfer and collection.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was carried out with a bias at 1.41 V versus RHE under illumination to further study the interface charge transport behaviour of the obtained WO3/BiVO4 nanostructures. Fig. 9b shows the obtained EIS Nyquist plots and their fitted impedance profiles for all four WO3/BiVO4 heterojunctions with different WO3 scaffold morphologies. A smaller arc radius was found for the E-WO3/BiVO4 sample as compared to the sample of I-WO3/BiVO4, followed by the M-WO3/BiVO4 and EG-WO3/BiVO4, which are reflected by the fitted values of R (Fig. S7†) calculated using the equivalent circuit model shown in Fig. S1a.† The relatively lower value of interfacial charge transfer resistance (R2 and R3) for E-WO3/BiVO4 can be observed compared to the others, which indicates a fast interfacial charge transfer across both the semiconductor–electrolyte interface and the semiconductor–semiconductor interface and thus improved the photoelectrochemical performance of the E-WO3/BiVO4 sample as shown above.
The stabilities of four types of WO3/BiVO4 nanostructures were investigated by measuring the curves of photocurrent density vs. time measured at 1.41 V vs. RHE under intermittent solar irradiation and are displayed in Fig. 9c. It can be found that the sample of E-WO3/BiVO4 shows the highest photocurrent value of about 1.6 mA cm−2 in the first 100 seconds, and then it experiences a dramatic decay in the next 900 seconds, which reveals a lower stability for this agglomerated nanostructure assembled by short nanorods, while for the sample I-WO3/BiVO4, a more stable photocurrent was observed with a photocurrent value of 1.3 mA cm−2 at the end of the long-run test, indicating a good stability in the photoelectrochemical reaction for the heterojunction architectures based on nanowall-like WO3 nanostructures. The M-WO3/BiVO4 and EG-WO3/BiVO4 samples also showed relatively stable PEC performance but possess a smaller photocurrent than sample I-WO3/BiVO4. The WO3/BiVO4 heterojunction nanostructures exhibited similar stability to that of the bare WO3 scaffolds shown in Fig. S8.† In these non-core/shell heterojunction nanostructures, WO3 scaffolds will be one of the primary factors that determine the photoelectrochemical properties of WO3-based heterojunction structures.
The incident-photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was measured at 1.41 V vs. RHE from 400 nm to 700 nm to evaluate the external quantum efficiency of the four types of nanostructural WO3/BiVO4 heterojunctions shown in Fig. 9d. All the samples showed the onset of IPCE at 530 nm, which originated from the visible absorption by the BiVO4 layers. The sample of E-WO3/BiVO4 showed the highest IPCE of ∼20% from 410 nm to 440 nm, and reduced to 19.5% at 450 nm, which is slightly lower than that of sample I-WO3/BiVO4 at 450 nm (about 20.5%). Relatively lower IPCE values of 19% and 18% at 440 nm were observed for samples EG-WO3/BiVO4 and M-WO3/BiVO4, respectively. The IPCE results are consistent with photocurrent results shown in Fig. 9a.
In this article, the surface morphology was considered as a key point to investigate the correlation between the morphology and PEC activity of heterojunctions. The factors representing the structural features and PEC performance are summarized in Table 2. For the EG-WO3/BiVO4 sample, the dense nanostructures and relatively smooth surface morphology (with a smaller roughness value) gave a relatively smaller improvement in PEC performance when compared to bare WO3, which resulted from the fact that less WO3/BiVO4 heterojunction interface and fewer active sites for PEC reaction were formed. The PEC performance of the M-WO3/BiVO4 heterojunction structure is lowest among the four samples resulting from its lowest specific surface area of block-like microstructures. Meanwhile, the random orientation of these block-like nanostructures resulted in more interfacial charge recombination and less efficient electron transport.16 The rod-like E-WO3/BiVO4 microstructures possessed smaller feature size and larger specific surface area as well as better charge transfer along the axial direction.52 As a result, relatively lower values of interfacial charge transfer resistance (R2 and R3) were obtained from the EIS results shown in Table 2. This structure shows the best photoelectrochemical properties but undergoes anodic photocorrosion. In comparison to E-WO3/BiVO4, the plate-like I-WO3/BiVO4 heterojunction with relatively low specific surface area yet shows a better PEC performance. However, the plate-like microstructures with larger plate thickness but higher surface roughness is significantly beneficial to the light scattering and thus promotes light absorption and carrier collection and finally improved photoelectrochemical performance. The photocatalytic activity of a semiconductor is a comprehensive reaction process controlled by multi-factor correlations including the morphological facts. It is essential to understand the systematic correlations between morphological features and photoelectrochemical performance as well as the photocatalytic process mechanism. Further work to obtain a more comprehensive understanding is under progress.

4. Conclusions
In summary, different WO3 morphologies, nanoblocks, nanorods, nanowalls and hierarchical nanostructures were prepared successfully by solely adjusting the solvent used in a hydrothermal route. We have designed four types of nanostructural WO3/BiVO4 heterojunctions by depositing a BiVO4 layer onto WO3 scaffolds with these four different morphologies. The obtained WO3/BiVO4 heterojunction showed a significantly improved performance in photoelectrochemical water oxidation than that of the corresponding bare WO3 nanostructures, especially for the sample of M-WO3/BiVO4, and it showed the highest photocurrent improvement of 2.5 times compared to that of its pristine M-WO3 scaffold, which is attributed to the enhanced photo absorption and improved charge separation when the heterojunction was fabricated. Comparatively, the EG-WO3/BiVO4 sample exhibits the lowest photocurrent improvement because of its relatively flat surface of EG-WO3 and smaller area of heterojunction interface for PEC reaction. Among the prepared nanostructural WO3/BiVO4 heterojunctions, the relatively low PEC performance of 1.1 mA cm−2 (1.41 V vs. RHE) was obtained for the block-like M-WO3/BiVO4 sample due to its lower specific surface area. The E-WO3/BiVO4 synthesized with ethanol as solvent in the hydrothermal reaction exhibited more optimal PEC activity and the photocurrent density reached up to 1.6 mA cm−2 (1.41 V vs. RHE), and its optimal rod-like microstructures with large specific surface area leading to efficient charge carrier transfer and separation contributed to the prominent PEC activity for water oxidation but experienced an obvious decrease in photocurrent performance within 900 s. Although limited by the lower specific area, the I-WO3/BiVO4 sample exhibits the highest photocurrent performance due to its efficient light scattering by the higher surface roughness and better stability, reflected by the chronoamperometric measurements, which indicates that WO3 scaffolds with different morphologies also exert an influence on the stability of WO3-based heterojunctions. Therefore, all the results show that the photoelectrochemical performance of WO3/BiVO4 heterojunctions depended strongly on the surface morphology of WO3 scaffolds. Our work provides an efficient strategy to understand the influence of heterojunction morphology on their photoelectrochemical performance and guidance for further selection of an optimal scaffold for the construction of heterojunction structures for efficient photocatalytic application.
