Hole injection materials are very important for achieving high performance OLEDs. Herein, solution-processed Cu doped NiOx prepared using a combustion method is demonstrated as the HIL in OLEDs. Nickel oxide (NiOx) thin films incorporated with p-type Cu dopants resulted in a significantly improved conductivity and hole-injection capability. The UV-ozone treated NiOx shows significantly better hole injection than that without being treated by UV-ozone. Our results show that phosphorescent green OLEDs with UV-ozone treated Cu:NiOx show a maximum current efficiency of 85.3 cd A−1, which is remarkably higher than the conventional device based on poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene-sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) which has a maximum current efficiency of 68.3 cd A−1.
Introduction
The first bilayer OLED was reported by Tang and van Slyke in 1987.1 Following this discovery, S. R. Forrest et al. presented efficient phosphorescent OLEDs (PhOLEDs)2 and C. Adachi reported efficient thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) OLEDs3 consecutively. OLEDs have drawn considerable attention for their display and lighting applications. In the past few years, devices fabricated by the vacuum thermal evaporation method have undergone rapid development. However, there are still many issues, such as high cost of production, difficulty in controlling uniform doping concentration, challenges in manufacturing large areas of panels, etc. that need to be dealt with. A roll-to-roll solution process may be a great prospective technology for manufacturing low-cost optoelectronic devices. To achieve high efficiencies of OLEDs, improved charge carrier injection is crucial to maintain a lower driving voltage.4–6 Numerous methods have been used to increase carrier injection.7–10 The most common way is to insert a thin HIL between the anode and hole transporting layer (HTL), in which the HIL should have a suitable work function (WF) to eliminate the large offset of energy levels between the work function of the anode and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the HTLs. The development of effective and stable hole injection materials is very important for achieving high-performance OLEDs. To date, PEDOT:PSS is still commonly used as a solution processed HIL, but PEDOT:PSS suffers from acidic and hygroscopic characteristics, which would deteriorate the device stability.11
Some vacuum-deposited small molecular materials such as 2,3,5,6-terafluoro-7,7,8,8-teracya-noquinodimethane (F4-TCNQ)12–14 and 1,4,5,8,9,11-hexaazatriphenylene hexacarboni-trile (HATCN)5,15–17 are often used in OLEDs, but they are not compatible with solution processing. In this respect, transition metal oxides with a high transparency and wide range of WFs as prepared by solution processing can be used as HILs for high-performance OLEDs. NiOx is an intrinsic p-type and wide bandgap semiconductor with a high ionization potential. It has been widely used as an HTL or electrode interlayer in optimizing the performance of organic optoelectronic devices.18–20 However, other transition metal oxides such as WOx, MoOx and VOx are n-type materials with high ionization potential with deep HOMO and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels.21 They are commonly used for hole injection; however, they cannot serve as electron blocking layers since their LUMOs are too deep. To prepare solution processing transition metal oxides, a sol–gel method is the most common way; however, the process needs high sintering temperatures of above 450 °C.22,23 Such high temperatures make them incompatible with commonly used polymeric and ITO glass substrates. This problem can be solved via a combustion chemistry reaction, from which a number of transition metal oxides have been successfully prepared at relatively low temperatures.24
In this manuscript, we demonstrate low-temperature solution processed p-type transition metal oxides, NiOx and Cu-NiOx, as the HIL in OLEDs, which show a superior hole injection ability compared to conventional MoO3 and PEDOT:PSS. Recently, solution-processed NiOx (s-NiOx) has been extensively studied as the HTLs in organic photovoltaics (OPVs) and perovskite-based solar cells (PVSCs).18–20 It is important to note that it exhibits a prominent increase of power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) and decent environmental stability. However, there are only a few reports on NiOx used in OLEDs. NiOx prepared by magnetron sputtering was reported as a HIL in conventional bilayer OLEDs.25 Recently So et al. reported high efficiency solution-processed phosphorescent OLEDs using s-NiOx as a HIL/HTL.26 Our work is different from their studies in many aspects. We introduce a low-temperature combustion approach to deposit s-NiOx and s-Cu-NiOx on ITO glass to fabricate efficient green phosphorescent OLEDs. The processing temperature is as low as 200 °C. As a result, the s-Cu-NiOx hole injection layer based phosphorescent green OLED has a maximum current efficiency of 85.3 cd A−1 and a power efficiency of 77.3 lm W−1.
Experimental
Materials and device fabrication
The combustion method is used to fabricate s-NiOx, and s-Cu:NiOx. We prepared nickel oxide precursor using the following procedure. First, 290.7 mg (1 mmol) of nickel(II) nitrate hexahydrate was dissolved in 2-methoxyethanol (10 ml). For the copper doped nickel oxide precursor, the entire amount of nickel(II) nitrate hexahydrate and copper(II) nitrate hydrate was 1 mmol. Precursor solutions with copper(II) nitrate hydrate mole percentages of 2.5%, 5%, 10%, 15% and 30% were prepared to fabricate s-Cu:NiOx films of different concentrations. The solution was vigorously stirred at 50 °C until it dissolved completely, and 100 μl of acetylacetone was then added to the solution, which was further stirred for 24 hours at room temperature in a nitrogen glove box. 1,1-Bis-(di-4-tolylaminophenyl)cyclohexane (TAPC) was used as the HTL. 4,4′,4′′-Tri-N-carbazolyltriphenylamine (TCTA) was used as the electron/exciton blocking layer (EBL) and 4,4′-bis(N-carbazolyl)-1,1′-biphenyl (CBP) as the host material. The commonly used bis(2-phenylpyridine)iridium acetylacetonate (Ir(ppy)2(acac)) was selected as the phosphorescent green dopant. 1,3,5-Tri[(3-pyridyl)-phen-3-yl]-benzene (TmPyPB) and 8-hydroxyquinolinato lithium (Liq) were selected as the electron transporting and injecting material, respectively. Aluminum (Al) was used as the cathode. All the materials were purchased from commercial sources and used without further purification. OLEDs were fabricated on an ITO-coated glass substrate with a thickness of 105 nm and a sheet resistance of 15 Ω square−1. The ITO glass substrate was rinsed by Decon 90 (15 minutes), ethanol (5 minutes), Decon 90 (5 minutes), and deionized water (5 minutes) in sequence, then dried in an oven at 110 °C. Before spin coating, the ITO substrates were treated by UV-ozone for 20 minutes. Precursor solutions were spin-coated at 4000 rpm for 40 seconds onto the ITO substrates in a glove box, then annealed in ambient atmosphere at 150 °C or 200 °C for 1 hour. After the s-NiOx and s-Cu:NiOx films on ITO were annealed in air to induce crystallization, they were treated by UV-ozone for 10 minutes. Last, the substrates were moved to a vacuum thermal evaporator chamber for deposition of other materials under a pressure of 1 × 10−6 Torr. The devices have a structure of ITO/HIL (20 nm)/TAPC (40 nm)/TCTA (20 nm)/CBP:Ir(ppy)2(acac) 8 wt% (20 nm)/TmPyPb (40 nm)/Liq (2 nm)/Al (120 nm). The HIL was spin coated onto ITO and all other layers were deposited by vacuum evaporation. Fig. 1 depicts the schematic of the device structure.

Film and device characterization
The electroluminescence (EL) characteristics and current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of all the devices were studied using a constant current source (Keithley 2400 Source Meter) with a photometer (Photo Research Spectra Scan PR 655). UV-Vis transmittance spectra were measured using a Varian Cary 5000 spectrophotometer. XPS and UPS measurements were carried out in a customized SPECS photoelectron spectroscopy system, including an analysis chamber (base pressure: 1.5 × 10−10 Torr), and a sample load-lock. XPS spectra were measured using a monochromatized Al Kα source (1486.7 eV) and UPS spectra using the monochromatized He Iα excitation line (21.21 eV). X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra were acquired using PANalytical (Empyrean) equipment. The results of solvent invasion were obtained and evaluated by a contact angle instrument (OCA, DataPhysics). The transition metal oxide film surface morphologies were evaluated by atomic force microscopy (AFM, Multimode V, Veeco) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Quanta 200 FEG, FEI).
Results and discussion
XPS and XRD analysis
To prepare s-NiOx and s-Cu-NiOx thin films, nickel(II) nitrate hexahydrate and copper(II) nitrate hydrate were used as oxidizers using acetylacetone as a fuel. To examine the quality of the prepared s-NiOx and s-Cu:NiOx films, XPS and XRD analysis were carried out as shown in Fig. S1 and S2 (ESI†). The Cu core level as shown reveals that the Cu was successfully incorporated into s-NiOx and exists mostly as CuO, which may imply an improvement of the electrical conductivity of the s-NiOx thin film. Furthermore, curve fitting of Ni 2p clearly shows that the Ni 2p is in good agreement with two different oxidation states (Ni2+ and Ni3+) in the form of a Gaussian function. From the XRD patterns of the s-NiOx and s-Cu:NiOx films, we can see that both the s-NiOx and s-Cu:NiOx films show XRD peaks at 2θ = 37.4° and 43.7°, which correspond to the (1 1 1) and (2 0 0) crystalline planes for the cubic-structured NiO.18 Also, the emergence of the Ni(2 0 0) peaks may indicate an incomplete oxidation of nickel. For the s-Cu:NiOx films, we can find the CuO(02) peaks, which again shows that Cu was successfully incorporated into s-NiOx.
UV-ozone & annealing temperatures
It has been reported that solution processed metal oxides can be prepared at relatively low annealing temperatures from 150 to 250 °C using a combustion chemistry method.24 In addition, we have also found that after a 10 minute UV-ozone treatment on the s-NiOx film, the s-NiOx based devices have a significantly better performance than those without UV-ozone treatment, which is in good agreement with other reports on plasma treated s-NiOx films.26,27 To demonstrate the beneficial effect of UV-ozone treatment and optimize the annealing temperature of s-NiOx films, phosphorescent green OLEDs were fabricated using s-NiOx as the HIL annealed at 150 or 200 °C (without UV-ozone treatment) and 200 °C (with UV-ozone treatment after the annealing process). Fig. 2(a) and (b) show the current density–voltage–luminescence (J–V–L) curves and current efficiency (CE)–power efficiency (PE) relationship of the devices. Fig. 2(c) and (d) illustrate the XPS spectra of the C 1s signal acquired from 200 °C annealed s-NiOx and 150 °C annealed s-NiOx films, respectively. We can clearly see that the devices, based on different ways of s-NiOx treatment, have a significantly different device performance. Under normal circumstances, the C 1s core level from ambient carbon should be located at a binding energy of 284.8 eV,26 but as shown in Fig. 2(d), the 150 °C annealed s-NiOx unexpectedly shows another shoulder peak which should be originated from the nickel ink precursor.26 That means, the 150 °C annealed s-NiOx based devices inferior to the 200 °C annealed s-NiOx based devices can be attributed to the incompletely decomposed nickel oxide precursor, resulting in a reduced hole injection. What's more, compared with the as-prepared s-NiOx, the device performance based on 200 °C annealed s-NiOx after 10 minutes of UV-ozone treatment has been improved significantly. At a luminance of 1000 cd m−2, the current and power efficiencies of the UV-ozone treated device are 77.8 cd A−1 and 66.4 lm W−1, respectively, compared to 55.7 cd A−1 and 38.1 lm W−1 for the film (200 °C annealed) without UV-ozone treatment. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) was used to investigate the electronic structure of the s-NiOx film (200 °C annealed). We found that the UV-ozone treatment could modify the work function and surface wetting properties of the s-NiOx. As shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†), the Ecut-off energies for the s-NiOx films with/without UV-ozone treatment are 16.02 eV and 16.40 eV, respectively, and the corresponding work function (ϕ) is estimated to be 5.19 eV and 4.81 eV by the equation ϕ = 21.21 − Ecut-off. The 0.38 eV increase of the work function upon UV ozone treatment would enhance the hole injection into the TAPC layer. The contact angle (CA) measurement is used to demonstrate the surface wetting properties of s-NiOx. It is found that the UV-ozone treatment reduces the water contact angle from 17.2° (untreated) to 4.6° (treated). Photographs of CA are shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†). The decrease in the water contact angle improves the surface wetting property of the s-NiOx HIL,28 which can lead to a good surface coverage for the next organic layer to be deposited on the s-NiOx film.

Optimization of doped-ion concentration
To understand the underlying effects of Cu doped s-NiOx films, we optimized the doping ratio of Cu in the range of 0–30 mol%. It should be noted that in the following studies, all the s-NiOx and s-Cu:NiOx films were subjected to 200 °C annealing and UV ozone treatment. A group of s-Cu:NiOx hole injection layer (HIL) based OLEDs with different doping concentrations were fabricated. Fig. S5 (ESI†) illustrates the current density–luminance–voltage characteristics and power/current efficiency as a function of luminance for green PhOLEDs based on s-Cu:NiOx (varied Cu ratio) HIL. By comparing the device with different Cu concentrations, we found that the 5 mol% of the Cu-doped device has the best performance.
In order to explore the reasons, we first measured the lateral electrical conductivity of the pristine s-NiOx and Cu doped s-NiOx films using a four-point probe method. As shown in Fig. 3(a), the electrical conductivity of the 5 mol% of Cu-doped s-NiOx films was 1.21 × 10−3 S cm−1, almost 1.5 times higher than those of the pristine s-NiOx films (8.34 × 10−4 S cm−1). Furthermore, we measured the J–V characteristics of the doped NiOx based hole-only devices with the structure of ITO/HILs (30 nm)/TAPC (40 nm)/TCTA (20 nm)/MoO3 (20 nm)/Ag (100 nm). The corresponding results are shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†). It can be seen that the 5% Cu-doped NiOx based film exhibits higher current density at the same forward bias than that of the pristine NiOx, indicating a more efficient hole injection at the 5% Cu-doped NiOx/TAPC interface. On the other hand, the potential drop of the device, represented as symbol V is calculated using Pouillet's law29 by the following equation (1)where J is the current density, S is the device area, σ is the conductivity and d is the thickness of the HIL. It is found that the potential drop difference between the NiOx and 5% Cu-doped NiOx based device at a current density of 200 mA cm−2 is only 1.2 × 10−4 V, which is remarkably smaller than the driving voltage difference (i.e. 1.5 V) at that particular current density. Therefore, the increased lateral electrical conductivity of the doped NiOx may not be able to explain the improved device performance. It is then substantiated that the higher CE and lower operating voltage of the Cu-doped NiOx based device is attributed to the more efficient hole injection at the HIL/TAPC interface. In addition, the current decreases with increasing the Cu content, which may be associated with the chemistry defects or the doping effect of Cu incorporated into the s-NiOx films.30

We also measured the transmittance spectra of s-Cu:NiOx films with different Cu concentrations as shown in Fig. 3(b). At lower doping concentrations, the transmittance of transition metal oxide (TMO) films has no change but by continuing to increase the Cu content, the transmittance of the material decreases significantly. The properties of our s-NiOx films are in good agreement with those in the literature.31 On the other hand, it is well known that the film formation and surface morphology of the layers are crucial to device performance. Fully vacuum evaporated OLEDs often have good film forming properties, but this is a significant problem for solution processed devices. In order to determine the film morphology, AFM was used to characterize the surface of s-Cu:NiOx (0–30 mol%) and the results are shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†). The root-mean-square (RMS) roughness slightly increases when increasing the doping concentration of Cu. The RMS surface roughness ranges from 1.71 to 3.38 nm.
Comparison of devices based on different injection layers
In order to demonstrate the potential applications of s-NiOx and s-Cu-NiOx, we have fabricated OLEDs using different kinds of prototypical HILs, i.e. PEDOT:PSS and MoO3. The PEDOT:PSS was prepared by spin coating while the MoO3 was deposited by thermal evaporation. Fig. 4(a) shows the J–V–L characteristics of the devices and Fig. 4(b) shows the efficiencies as a function of luminance. The 5 mol% s-Cu:NiOx based device shows the lowest driving voltage. In contrast, the MoO3 and bare-ITO based devices show the highest driving voltage. Fig. 4(c) clearly shows that the incorporation of the s-NiOx and s-Cu-NiOx HILs does not shift the electroluminescence (EL) spectra. Instead, the emission intensities of s-NiOx and s-Cu-NiOx HIL based devices are much higher than those of reference devices. Inset in Fig. 4(c) is the photographs of green PhOLEDs using s-Cu-NiOx HILs at the normal direction at 5 mA cm−2. The detailed device performance is summarized in Table 1. The device composed of s-Cu:NiOx (5 mol%) HIL exhibits the highest current efficiency, power efficiency and EQE of 85.3 cd A−1, 77.3 lm W−1 and 22.3%, respectively, without using any light out-coupling techniques. In particular, the power efficiency is increased by 26.9% and 11.3% compared with the device without interfacial modification and with pristine s-NiOx HIL. The surface morphology of different HILs was examined by AFM and SEM, and the results are shown in Fig. 5. Compared with the evaporated MoO3 films, both the s-NiOx and 5 mol% s-Cu:NiOx films still have a smooth surface. There were few pinholes and little crystal aggregation on the film surface. The RMS surface roughnesses of 5 mol% s-Cu:NiOx, s-NiOx, MoO3 and PEDOT:PSS films were 2.07 nm, 1.71 nm, 0.55 nm and 1.57 nm, respectively. We can conclude that the combustion method to prepare s-NiOx and s-Cu:NiOx would not exert too much adverse effect on the surface morphology. In contrast, a slightly increased roughness can increase the contact area with the HTL and is beneficial for charge injection.32

To investigate the effectiveness of different HILs used in the present study, a series of hole-only devices were fabricated. The hole-only device had the following structure: ITO/HIL (30 nm)/TCTA (60 nm)/MoO3 (20 nm)/Ag (100 nm). Fig. 6(a) shows the J–V characteristics in four hole-only devices. The current density versus voltage curves indicate that, compared with the polymer PEDOT:PSS, inorganic TMOs show a significantly better J–V plot. The J–V curves also imply that Cu-doped s-NiOx greatly increases the hole injection ability over that of the pristine s-NiOx. In addition, the current density of MoO3, as a commonly used HIL in vacuum evaporated devices, is obviously lower than that of s-NiOx and s-Cu-NiOx.

It is well known that electrode/organic interfaces play an important role in determining the energy-level alignment (ELA).33 The interface between our commonly used ITO anode and HTL usually has a barrier that exceeds 0.5 eV,34 and inserting a buffer layer or HIL can be a very good solution to tackle this barrier issue. To clearly understand the mechanism for the device improvement when the s-Cu:NiOx film was used, UPS evaluation of different HIL modified ITO samples was performed. The work function of TMOs and PEDOT:PSS and the HOMO energy level of the HTL are summarized in Table S1 (ESI†). It can be seen that the introduction of PEDOT:PSS, s-NiOx and 5 mol% s-Cu:NiOx would form a cascade energy level alignment, which favors hole injection into the TAPC layer (HOMO: −5.5 eV35), as shown in Fig. 6(b). In short, the improved performance of s-Cu:NiOx based devices in this study is attributed to the reduced hole-injecting barrier at the anode/doped HIL interface, and more efficient hole injection at the HIL/HTL interface.
Finally, to explore if the s-Cu:NiOx can function as both the HIL and HTL, we fabricated another device with this configuration: ITO/HTL (40 nm)/TCTA (20 nm)/CBP: Ir(ppy)2(acac) 8 wt% (20 nm)/TmPyPb (40 nm)/Liq (2 nm)/Al (120 nm), where HTL is s-NiOx, s-Cu:NiOx or TAPC (as a reference device). The device performance is shown in Fig. 7. It can be seen that both the s-NiOx and s-Cu:NiOx based devices show similar J–V–L characteristics, with the current and power efficiencies slightly higher than those of the reference device. The details are summarized in Table S2 (ESI†). These results show that the hole-transport capability of s-Cu:NiOx is superior to that of TAPC. However, utilization of s-Cu:NiOx itself as the HTL may not be as effective as that applied as the HIL. After all, there is a large energy level offset (0.52 eV) between the work function of s-Cu:NiOx and HOMO of TCTA (HOMO: −5.7 eV35), instead of a cascade energy level alignment among s-Cu:NiOx, TAPC and TCTA.

Conclusions
In conclusion, high-performance green PhOLEDs using low-temperature combustion derived Cu-doped s-NiOx HILs have been demonstrated. The Cu doping concentration has been optimized at 5 mol%. Cu doping is a very simple and effective approach to enhance the electrical conductivity of s-NiOx. SEM and AFM analysis reveals a smooth and compact surface morphology of the s-NiOx and s-Cu:NiOx films. The electronic structure of s-NiOx and s-Cu-NiOx with/without UV-ozone treatment has been examined by UPS measurements. As a result, the green PhOLED device with the UV-ozone treated solution-processed Cu-NiOx HIL shows a maximum current efficiency and power efficiency of 85.3 cd A−1 and 77.3 lm W−1, respectively, which is significantly higher than those with the PEDOT:PSS HIL. Our results reveal that solution-processed metal doped oxides can be used as a hole-injection layer for high-efficiency OLED fabrications.
