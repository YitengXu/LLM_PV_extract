    , Accepted 14th June 2019First published on 15th June 2019AbstractElectrochemical nitrogen (N2) fixation as an effective method has realized the sustainable production of ammonia where efficient electrocatalysts for converting N2 into NH3 at room temperature have become a key scientific issue. Herein, we proposed that the catalytic activity of a single Mo atom supported on graphene (Mo/G) for the nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) can be tuned by non-metal heteroatom (B, N, P, S, Se etc.) doping. Our density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the Se atom is the best doping element to tune the optimal electronic structure of the Mo atom for catalyzing the NRR among these heteroatoms, leading to the lowest potential of 0.41 V vs. RHE for Mo/SeG, which is much better than the current metal-based catalysts. Our work provided a new strategy to design electrocatalysts for the NRR.
Introduction
Ammonia (NH3), one of the most produced chemicals (about 150 million tons per year)1 in the chemical industry, can be used for the manufacture of synthetic chemicals, such as fertilizers, medicaments, dyes, explosives, and resins.2–4 To date, the ammonia synthesis method in the chemical industry has mainly relied on the Haber–Bosch process, where nitrogen (N2) and hydrogen (H2) react in the presence of an iron-based catalyst and under harsh conditions (∼700 K and ∼100 atm, consuming 1 to 2% of the world's annual energy output with ∼300 metric tons of CO2 during the combustion of fossil fuels5,6) with a low yield of NH3 (conversion ratio: 10–15%) due to the chemical inertness of N2 (bond energy is 9.75 eV). Thus, efforts have been devoted to the development of alternative ways to alleviate the Haber–Bosch process, such as photocatalytic,7,8 electrochemical9,10 and biological11,12 methods, among which the electrochemical method is widely regarded as an energy-saving and environmentally benign process with broad prospects for sustainable conversion of N2 to NH3 at moderate temperature and atmospheric pressure because it can be powered by renewable energy such as hydro, solar, wind or nuclear energy.5 Thus, it is essential to design efficient electrocatalysts for the NRR under mild conditions and understand the underlying mechanisms for electrocatalyzing the N2 reduction reaction (NRR).
Recently, a large number of electrocatalysts have been experimentally and theoretically proven to be effective for the NRR, mainly focused on metal-based catalysts (Au, Ag, Pt, Pd, Cu, V, Ru, Mo, Ti, etc.).13–25 Among these metal species, Mo as a non-noble metal material can effectively catalyze the NRR under mild conditions, and the limiting potential needed to produce NH3 on the flat (110) Mo surface is about −0.5 V, which is located on top of the volcano diagram for the NRR proposed by Nørskov et al.26 However, the (110) surface of Mo bulk will likely be covered with H atoms that limit the catalytic performance of Mo-based electrocatalysts for the NRR. Therefore, the selectivity and catalytic performance of Mo-based electrocatalysts for the NRR have attracted much attention. For example, Wang et al. proposed molybdenum carbide nanodots embedded in ultrathin carbon nanosheets that catalyzed the NRR under mild conditions.27 The maximum NH3 yield rate and faradaic efficiency (FE) were 11.3 μg h−1 mg−1 and 7.8%. Recently, we theoretically predicted a new 2D MoC6 that can convert N2 to NH3 with a low potential (−0.54 V vs. RHE) under ambient conditions.19 Moreover, Sun et al. theoretically predicted and experimentally confirmed that MoS2 can be an active NRR electrocatalyst with high selectivity under mild conditions.10 The above results imply that the Mo-based electrocatalyst is a great potential candidate for the NRR at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. So far, there are still very few electrocatalysts that can efficiently produce NH3 under ambient conditions with high catalytic performance and stability because the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) as a mainly competitive reaction limits the catalytic performance of the NRR.
Recently, a single atomic catalyst (SAC) has become a kind of important candidate material for various catalytic reactions due to its high specific activity and atomic utilization, which can efficiently reduce the loading of active metals that reduce the cost of preparation.13,28–32 Jung and co-workers designed a series of single transition metal atom catalysts anchored on distinct defective graphene sites containing carbon vacancies and nitrogen to promote the electrochemical NRR by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, which indicated that the catalytic activity of the SAC can also be tuned by the substrate.13 Zhao and co-workers investigated the single Mo atom supported on a defective boron nitride monolayer as an N2 fixation electrocatalyst, which exhibited a quite low overpotential for N2 fixation at room temperature.18 Graphene has attracted much attention as a well-known substrate material for the SAC due to its large specific surface and high electrical conductivity. Furthermore, chemical doping is an effective method to tailor the electrical properties of graphene.33
Inspired by previous investigations, we investigated the potential catalytic activity for the NRR on a single Mo atom anchored on graphene with decoration of non-metal atoms (Mo/XG, X denotes B, N, P, S, Se and Cl, wherein G denotes pure graphene). DFT calculations were used to study the stability of Mo/XG and the corresponding catalytic performance in the NRR. Our results indicated that Mo/SeG exhibited the highest catalytic activity for the NRR with the lowest potential of 0.41 V vs. RHE.
Computational details
All calculations were performed by means of the spin-polarized density functional theory (DFT) in the DMol3 code.34 The exchange–correlation effects were described by the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof exchange–correlation functional (PBE).35 The van der Waals interactions were described using the empirical correction in the Grimme scheme (DFT+D2)36 and the density functional semi-core pseudopotential core treatment was implemented for relativistic effects with the basis set of double numerical plus polarization (DNP).37,38 The convergence criteria of the geometrical optimization were set to be 1.0 × 10−5 Hartree (Ha), 2.0 × 10−3 Ha Å−1, and 5.0 × 10−3 Å for the energy change, the gradient, and the displacement, respectively. A supercell consisting of 5 × 5 × 1 unit cells with a vacuum gap of 15 Å was employed and the Brillouin zones were sampled by a Monkhorst–Pack k-point mesh with a 4 × 4 × 1 k-point grid. The atom charges were calculated by the Mulliken population analysis to further study the properties of charge transfer.39
The binding energies (ΔEad-nMo) of Mo species on heteroatom doped graphene is determined by ΔEad-nMo = (EnMo/XG − EXG − nEMo)/n(1)where EnMo/XG, EXG and EMo are the total energies of Mon/XG (n = 1, 2), the heteroatom doped graphene, and the single Mo atom, respectively. In addition, the calculations of Gibbs free energy change (ΔG) of every elemental step was based on a computational hydrogen electrode (CHE) model proposed by Nørskov et al., which uses one half of the chemical potential of H2 as the chemical potential of the proton–electron pair.26,40,41 The value of ΔG can be calculate by ΔG = ΔE + ΔEZPE − TΔS + ΔGpH + ΔGU(2)where ΔE, ΔEZPE, ΔS, and T are the reaction energy, the zero point energy, the entropy difference between products and reactants, and the temperature (298.15 K in this work), respectively. ΔGpH, the free energy correction of pH, can be calculated by ΔGpH = kBT × pH × ln10 (the value of pH in this work was set to be zero) and ΔGU is the contribution of the applied electrode potential (U) to ΔG. The limiting potential (Ulimiting) can be calculated by Ulimiting = ΔG/e(3)where ΔG represents the most positive free energy change of each elementary step during the N2 reduction process.
The selectivity of N2 (fN2) can be simply estimated according to the Boltzmann distribution,42 fN2 = 1/(1 + exp{−δG/kBT})(4)where δG denotes the Gibbs free energy difference between two competitive reactions at the same time and kB denotes the Boltzmann constant. If we assumed that the probability of N2 adsorption is 1, the probability of the competitive adsorption of other molecules (H2O will be considered in this work) could be exp{−δG/kBT}, and δG = ΔGad-H2O − ΔGad-N2.
Results and discussion
The key of the NRR is the activation of N2, which is related to the absorption energy value of N2 (ΔEad-N2). In the most energetically favorable adsorption configurations (side-on or end-on) on Mo/XG, ΔEad-N2 values were calculated (Fig. 1a). All ΔEad-N2 values are about −1 eV, indicating the strong interaction between Mo/XG and N2. Besides, it is generally believed that the first protonation of adsorbed N2 (N2* + H+ + e− → NNH*) is the potential-limiting step (PLS) for the NRR.1,13 The more negative the adsorption energy values of the NNH* species (ΔEad-NNH) are, the lower the reaction energies of the first protonation of adsorbed N2 are, or the lower the overpotential of the reduction process is. Thus, we screened a series of Mo/XG using ΔEad-NNH and selected an optimal candidate as an NRR electrocatalyst. As shown in Fig. 1a, Mo/SeG exhibits the strongest stabilization for NNH* species (ΔEad-NNH = −3.21 eV), indicating that it could exhibit an excellent performance for the NRR. Therefore, Mo/SeG will be focused on in the follow discussion.

Fig. 1b presents the optimized geometry structure of Mo/SeG. The bond length of Mo–Se, Mo–C, and Se–C is 2.355 Å, 1.941 Å, and 1.943 Å, respectively. It is known that the clustering tendency of a single metal atom in the SAC is always a huge challenge mainly due to its high surface energy, which could reduce the catalytic activity.13,18,43 In general, if the adsorbed dimer is more unstable than the absorbed single atom, the clustering tendency of the single atom on the substrate surface can be avoided.44,45 Herein, we calculated the model of two atoms located at the opposite side of the plane in light of eqn (1). The ΔEad-2Mo value calculated is −3.18 eV. Compared with that located at the same side, ΔEad-2Mo = −3.47 eV, we know that both the cases are less stable than a single Mo atom where ΔEad-Mo = −4.86 eV. Kinetically, the diffusion barrier of the Mo atom on Se doped graphene from the C-vacancy site to its neighboring hollow site was also calculated. Due to the high energy barrier (3.80 eV) and large reaction energy (3.51 eV), the clustering tendency could be absent (Fig. 2a). Moreover, the partial density of states (PDOS) of Mo/SeG is shown in Fig. 2b where significant hybridization among the 4d orbitals of Mo atoms, the 4p orbitals of Se atoms and the 2p orbitals of C atoms can be found, suggesting the good structural stability of the Mo/SeG system. The dynamical stability of Mo/SeG was also investigated by frequency calculations (Fig. S1, ESI†). It can be seen that there is no appreciable imaginary frequency, which suggested the dynamical stability of Mo/SeG. Moreover, it is noteworthy that the d-band center of the Mo atom in Mo/SeG (−2.34 eV) is closer to the Fermi level than in Mo/G (−2.57 eV), namely the introduction of Se increases the NRR catalytic activity of Mo/SeG according to the d-band center theory.46

To investigate the catalytic activity for the NRR on Mo/SeG, the N2 activation on Mo/SeG, with possible adsorption configurations, is shown in Fig. 3a and b. The bond length of the NN bond elongated from 1.108 Å to 1.175 Å for the side-on configuration and to 1.130 Å for the end-on configuration. Moreover, the electron density difference (Fig. 3c and d) and the Mulliken charge analysis (Fig. S2, ESI†) of Mo/SeG with the adsorbed N2 was further calculated. Obviously, a significant charge transfer (0.242 e) from Mo/SeG to the N2 molecule is observed, denoting effective activation of the adsorbed N2. To elucidate the bonding nature of the N2 species involved in the activation process, we investigated the change in the PDOS of N2 and Mo atoms before and after adsorption (Fig. 3e and f). Since the energy levels of the Mo d-orbitals (2.58 eV) have a good matching degree with N2 π* orbitals (2.62 eV), the π* orbitals of N2 can be occupied partially by the electrons of d-orbitals to form d-π* orbitals, which weakens the NN bond and is in agreement with our previous speculate based on the d-band center theory.47

To further estimate the catalytic activity of Mo/SeG for the NRR, we then calculated the reaction steps with a six proton/electron reduction process via enzymatic, alternating and distal mechanisms. These feasible reaction pathways and corresponding reaction energies are given in Fig. S3 (ESI†). The end-on adsorbed N2 can be reduced through two different ways (alternating and distal) while the side-on adsorbed N2 can be reduced through enzymatic mechanisms. In the distal mechanism, the proton–electron pairs (H+ + e−) preferentially attack one N atom furthest away from the catalyst surface to release the first NH3 molecule and then the protonation process continues to produce another NH3 molecule. In the alternating mechanism, H+ + e− attacks two N atoms alternately to form NH3. In the enzymatic mechanism, the two N atoms are hydrogenated by the proton–electron pairs alternately, and the second NH3 molecule will be released just following the release of the first NH3 molecule.
Since there is a strong adsorption of N2 on Mo/SeG, we compared the adsorption free energy values of Mo/SeG with only one dinitrogen molecule (ΔGad-N2 = −0.66 eV) and two dinitrogen molecules (ΔGad-2N2 = −0.05 eV). The results indicate that the adsorption of two or more N2 on the one Mo atom is impossible due to the weak ΔGad-2N2 in this system. Therefore, only the case of adsorption of one dinitrogen molecule is considered in this work. Note that N2 can be fixed with the same ΔG value of −0.66 eV through side-on and end-on adsorption, which implies that both adsorption configurations are possible. The Gibbs free energy diagrams for the NRR on Mo/SeG along the distal and alternating mechanisms are shown in Fig. 4a and b. Through the distal and alternating mechanisms, the free energy uphill (0.82 eV) for the first hydrogenation of N2 (N2* + H+ + e− → NNH*) is the largest during the N2 reduction process, being the PLS and showing the inefficiency of both the mechanisms. In Fig. 4c, the Gibbs free energy diagrams for the NRR through the enzymatic mechanisms are plotted. The corresponding reaction free energies for the hydrogenation of adsorbed N2 are 0.41, 0.14, −0.36, −1.55, 0.41, and 0.04 eV, respectively. Thus, both the first hydrogenation of the adsorbed N2 and the generation of the first NH3 (NH2*NH2* + H+ + e− → NH2* + NH3) are the PLS with a low ΔG = 0.41 eV. However, the actual reaction pathway of N2 fixation may be complex and involve in a mixed mechanism (H+ + e− attacks the unhydrogenated N atom in NNH2* species in the distal mechanism and then shuttles to the alternating mechanism).18,48 This is shown in Fig. 4d where via the mixed mechanism the free energy for the protonation of N2* to NNH* species remains 0.82 eV, being much higher than that via the enzymatic mechanism. Thus, the enzymatic mechanism is the best one among the known mechanisms. The corresponding ΔG value and structure configurations of each intermediate state are shown in Fig. 5 (other mechanisms of the NRR discussed above are shown in Fig. S4, ESI†).

In addition to catalytic activity, the selectivity for the NRR is another important indicator for evaluating catalysts. Firstly, hydrazine (N2H4) would not be formed as a by-product during the process of the NRR because the N–N bond will break (NH2NH* + H+ + e− → NH2*NH2*) with a negative ΔG value (−1.55 eV). Besides, considering that the HER is a major competitive reaction of the NRR in a protic solvent, we also calculated the adsorption energy for H (ΔEad-H) on Mo/SeG. Since the ΔEad-H on the single Se atom in Mo/SeG (1.01 eV) is positive, it is difficult for a single Se atom to adsorb H atoms. Moreover, our calculations also showed that H atoms will be preferentially adsorbed on the Mo atom in Mo/SeG with a negative ΔEad-H (−0.37 eV). It is noteworthy that the adsorption of H atoms on Mo atoms is much weaker than that of N2 (ΔEad-N2 = −1.13 eV) in our system, implying that the adsorption of N2 is preferred and the adsorption of hydrogen is energetically unfavourable. We also considered the competitive adsorption of H2O and N2 in electrolyte. Since the values of ΔGad-H2O (−0.61 eV) and ΔGad-N2 (−0.66 eV) are similar, both adsorptions should be present. Then, we calculated the selectivity toward N2 (fN2) in light of eqn (4). The calculated fN2 of Mo/SeG is 86.7% at room temperature, implying that the adsorption of N2 is superior to that of H2O. As a result, Mo/SeG shows excellent NRR selectivity and catalytic performance, which are much better than those of the current metal-based catalysts. The corresponding comparison is shown in Table S1 (ESI†).
Conclusions
In summary, by DFT calculations, we have explored the potential of a single Mo atom supported on various heteroatom doped graphene as electrocatalysts for N2 fixation. Our results demonstrated that the Mo/SeG system shows excellent catalytic performance in the NRR. In particular, the Ulimiting of Mo/SeG for the NRR is as low as −0.41 V through the enzymatic mechanism with high stability and selectivity for NH3 synthesis, which is better than those of the current metal-based catalysts, suggesting a potential application in NH3 synthesis.
