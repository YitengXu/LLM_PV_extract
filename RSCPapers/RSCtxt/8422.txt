    , Accepted 15th October 2020First published on 21st October 2020AbstractIn order to increase the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic solar cells, developing high-performance non-fullerene small molecule acceptors is important for efficient charge generation and small energy loss. Herein, we design and synthesize a new member of the A–DA′D–A-series acceptor family, Y18-ID, which employs 1-hexyl-1H indole (ID) instead of the traditional 2-hexylthieno[3.2-b]thiophene as the electronic donor. Compared to Y18, Y18-ID exhibits extended optical absorption towards the longer wavelength region and an upshift in both the highest occupied molecular orbital and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy levels. Organic solar cells based on P:Y18-ID delivered a power conversion efficiency of 15.25% with a very low energy loss of 0.51 eV. We believe that Y18-ID may become one of the most important candidates among non-fullerene acceptors, owing to its broader absorption profile and higher lowest unoccupied molecular orbital, which allow it to achieve both high open circuit voltage and short circuit current simultaneously.
Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) based on a bulk-heterojunction photoactive layer consisting of a polymer donor and electron acceptor (fullerene or non-fullerene) have been considered as a potential technology because of their benefits in constructing devices with light weight, solution processability, flexibility and semitransparency.1–5 In the early stage of OSCs, fullerene derivatives played a dominant role as electron acceptors due to their suitable electron affinity and isotropic electron transporting properties, and obtained power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) in the range of 10–11%.6–8 However, fullerene derivatives have some unavoidable shortcomings, such as weak absorption in the visible and near-infrared region of the solar spectrum and the inadequate tunability of their optical and electrochemical properties, which hinders their further application in OSCs.9,10 Moreover, the energy loss, Eloss, for OSCs based on fullerene acceptors is around 0.8 eV or higher. In recent years, rapid progress in non-fullerene small molecule acceptors (NFSMAs) has offered an effective way to improve the PCE of OSCs owing to their tunable energy levels, planarity and crystallinity.11–16 As a result, PCEs in the range of 17–18% have been achieved,17–20 which can satisfy the requirements of the photovoltaic market.21,22 Notably, employing NFSMAs in OSCs has shown promise in lowering the Eloss,23–25 since efficient charge separation takes place in NFSMA-based OSCs with small energetic offsets between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of the donors and acceptors.26,27 However, their Eloss values are still higher than those of C–Si- and perovskite-based solar cells.28,29 Therefore, further reduction of the Eloss values in OSCs through the design of new polymer donors and NFSMAs is still required.30–33
Recently, Zou's group has synthesized some NFSMAs with an A–DA′D–A configuration, in which an electron-deficient central core (benzotriazole or benzodithiazole) is attached onto the thienopyrrole-fused ring.34–37 The DA'D fused framework adopts a relatively planar backbone, enriching the delocalization of the π-electrons, which promotes good intermolecular packing via strong π–π interactions and therefore increases the charge carrier mobility.36 Their extended absorption in the near-infrared region of the solar spectrum makes them the potential candidates as the active layer for semitransparent OSCs with a balanced PCE and average visible transmittance (AVT).38 The Zou group reported the first A–DA′D–A pentacyclic non-fullerene acceptor (NFA) BZIC22 in 2017, which was also represented the beginning of Y-series acceptors. The multi-fused benzotriazole (BTA)-based n-type semiconductor BZIC obtained a PCE of 6.3% when blended with the polymer donor HFQx-T.23 The fused central ring was then extended by using thieno[3,2-b]thiophene instead of a thiophene segment, and the new NFA Y1 was synthesized. Y1 has been applied in OSCs, i.e. tandem, ternary and flexible devices,39–41 owing to the distinctive optical and electrochemical properties of A–DA′D–A type molecules. More notably, with the development of the A–DA′D–A series NFSMAs, the typical acceptor Y6 has opened the research field of OSCs to new perspectives and has increased the PCE of OSCs to over 15%.42 Although the Y6 NFSMA has had great success, the performance of A–DA′D–A type acceptors still has great potential for improvement.34,42 Recently, Zou et al. designed a new A–DA′D–A NFSMA known as Y18,43 in which the benzothiadiazole unit in Y6 is replaced with a benzotriazole unit, which has lower electron-accepting ability than benzothiadiazole. The single-junction OSCs based on Y18 paired with the polymer PM6 as a donor realized a PCE of 16.52% with an energy loss of 0.53 eV. In ternary OSCs using PC71BM as third component, the PCE was further improved to over 17%.
In continuation of our research work in the development of A–DA′D–A NFSMAs, herein, we have designed and synthesized a new A–DA′D–A type acceptor molecule, namely, Y18-ID. As shown in Fig. 1, Y18-ID is obtained by using 1-hexyl-1H indole (ID) instead of 2-hexylthieno[3.2-b]thiophene (TT) to modify the molecular structure of Y18. Compared to Y18, Y18-ID in the thin-film state showed a redshifted absorption spectrum and upshifted HOMO and LUMO energy levels. We selected the medium bandgap D–A conjugated polymer P as the donor, since it exhibited a complementary absorption profile (350–750 nm) and a deeper HOMO energy level to afford a high value of open circuit voltage (Voc).44 Photovoltaic devices were constructed using polymer P as the donor and applying solvent vapor annealing in THF as a post-treatment to study the performance of Y18-ID. The P:Y18-ID-based device showed a PCE of 15.25% with a significant low Eloss of 0.51 eV. The chemical structures of P and Y18-ID are shown in Fig. 1.

Results and discussion
Synthesis of Y18-ID
The synthetic route for Y18-ID is shown in Scheme S1.† Compound 3 was synthesized with a yield of 92% through a Stille coupling reaction between compound 1 and compound 2 using Pd(PPh3)Cl2 as the catalyst and toluene as the solvent. The fused central ring (compound 4) was obtained by the double intramolecular Cadogan reductive cyclization of compound 3 in the presence of triethyl phosphate, followed by the addition of 1-bromo-2-ethylhexene under alkaline conditions. Treatment of compound 4 with n-butyllithium (n-Buli) at −78 °C followed by the addition of N-formyl piperidine gave the compound 5. Finally, the target molecule Y18-ID was obtained with a yield of 72% through the Knoevenagel condensation of compound 5 and 2-(5,6-difluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene)-malononitrile. The structure of Y18-ID was confirmed by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra (ESI†). Y18-ID is soluble in common solvents, such as chloroform, chlorobenzene and o-dichlorobenzene, at room temperature.
Optical and electrochemical analysis
The normalized absorption spectra of Y18-ID in dilute chloroform solution and in the film state, as well as that of Y18 in the film state, are shown in Fig. 2b. Y18-ID in thin film shows an absorption peak at 852 nm and an absorption onset of 970 nm, which are red-shifted by 68 nm and 108 nm, respectively, compared to its solution absorption spectra, suggesting strong aggregation in the solid state. Compared to Y18, Y18-ID exhibits a wider absorption band from 600–970 nm with a smaller optical bandgap of 1.28 eV, indicating that the introduction of ID is beneficial to molecular light absorption and intramolecular charge transfer. We selected the D–A conjugated polymer P (Fig. 1) as the donor for the investigation. As shown in Fig. 2a, its thin-film optical absorption spectrum has a broad range from 350 to 740 nm, which is complementary to that of Y18-ID. The P:Y18-ID-blend-based film shows a strong absorption profile with a broad wavelength from 350 to 980 nm.

The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of Y18-ID were measured using cyclic voltammetry (CV) with the ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) redox couple (4.8 eV below the vacuum level) as an internal reference. The CV curve is displayed in Fig. S6 (ESI†). The HOMO and LUMO energy levels estimated from the onset oxidation and onset reduction potential are −5.43 eV and −3.75 eV, respectively, which are higher than those of −5.58 eV and −3.91 eV for Y18 in Fig. 3. This indicates that compared to the traditional TT unit, incorporating ID at the end of the fused skeleton as an electronic donor can significantly improve the energy levels.

The energy level diagram of P and Y18-ID is shown in Fig. 3. It is well known that the driving force for exciton dissociation is determined by the energy offset (ΔEoffset) between the HOMO (or LUMO) energy levels of the donor and acceptor. The HOMO energy offset ΔEoffset (H) and LUMO energy offset ΔEoffset (L) between the LUMO of Y18-ID and P are very small (Fig. 3). Therefore, we recorded the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of pristine P, Y18-ID and P:Y18-ID to obtain information about the exciton dissociation and charge transfer in the active layer, as shown in Fig. 4a and b. The PL emission peak of pristine Y18-ID is located at 946 nm (Fig. 4a) when light with a wavelength of 840 nm is used as the excitation source. The polymer P shows a PL emission peak at 756 nm when excited at a wavelength of 640 nm. However, these are significantly quenched in the P:Y18-ID blend film (Fig. 4b), suggesting efficient electron transfer from the LUMO of polymer P to Y18-ID at the D/A interface in the active layer. These results indicate that although the LUMO and HOMO offsets between Y18-ID and P are lower than the threshold value for exciton dissociation (∼0.3 eV) and charge transfer, efficient exciton dissociation and charge transfer occurs in the P:Y18-ID blend, even at small offsets, as observed in most NFSMA-based OSCs.45,46

Theoretical simulations
The Y18-ID structure was examined theoretically by applying density functional theory (DFT)47–50 and time-dependent DFT. An implicit solvation model was employed with chloroform (CF) as the solvent. All alkyl groups were shortened to ethyl moieties to decrease the computational cost. The B3LYP48,49 and M06 (ref. 50) functionals were used for both ground- and excited-state computations. The results reported are all from computations performed using the Gaussian package.51 The ESI† includes further technical details of the computational methods and methodologies.

Y18-ID is composed of a central structure with two linked side inden-ylidene-malononitrile (IYM) moieties. The central structure is a condensed indole-pyrrolo-triazolo (IPT) moiety. The structure is highly planar with the exception of the attached alkyl chains, which extend out of the plane. Table 1 gives the computed properties, the energy levels of the frontier orbitals, the optical gaps, the main contributions to the first excitation, and the wavelength of the first excitation as well as those of the excitations with the largest oscillator strengths.

The iso-surfaces of the frontier orbitals of Y18-ID are shown in Fig. 5. The HOMO of Y18-ID extends over the entire central structure of the IPT group with only minimal contributions from the side IYM moieties. The LUMO is localized mainly over the IYM moieties with a small contribution from the central structure. In Table 1, we also provide the contributions of over 9% to the first allowed excitations. The first excitation exhibits a clear HOMO–LUMO single-configuration character.

Previous works52–55 in the field indicate that increases in PCE may be related to differences in the transition electric dipole moment, μge. Herein, we use the expression  to calculate the transition electric dipole moment accounting for directionality, where μga and μea are the a-components (a = x, y, z) of the ground-state and excited-state electric dipole moments, respectively. The expression Δμge = μe − μg is used to calculate the difference between the magnitudes of the ground-state and excited-state dipole moments. The computed values of μge and Δμge for Y18-ID were 20.2 D and 13.6 D, respectively, and the ground- and excited-state electric dipole moments μg and μe were 8.1 and 21.7, respectively. The transition electric dipole moment μge (i.e. the dipole moment accounting for the change in direction) is significant. As such, pronounced instantaneous intramolecular charge separation55 is expected to occur as a result of the polarized exciton. The change in the magnitude of the ground- and excited-state electric dipole moments Δμge is also considerable. Another factor that contributes to a high PCE value is enhanced stacking; however, the absorption profile should also be considered.
The computed UV/visible absorbance spectra employing time-dependent DFT using the M06 functional, both accounting for solvent effects with chloroform as the solvent and in the gas phase, are shown in Fig. 6. The UV/vis spectra show a band with strong absorbance and three distinct bands at smaller wavelengths. The bands are centered at 705 nm, 510 nm, 400 nm, and 325 nm. The corresponding spectra computed using the B3LYP functional are provided in Fig. S7 and Table S1 (ESI†). The same main characteristics are also found in the UV/vis spectra computed using the B3LYP functional. Compared to the results obtained using the M06 functional, the first peak is notably underestimated by about 60 nm, and the small wavelength peaks by about 20 nm–40 nm. The HOMO–LUMO (HL) gaps computed with B3LYP are lower by about 0.12 eV.

Photovoltaic studies
The photovoltaic performance of P:Y18-ID was investigated in BHJ OSCs with the conventional configuration of indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/active layer/poly[(9,9-dioctyl-2,7-fluorene)-alt-(9,9-bis(3′-N,N-dimethylamino)-propyl)-2,7-fluorene] (PFN)/Al, where indium tin oxide (ITO) and Al act as the anode and cathode, respectively, PEDOT:PSS and PFN act as the hole transport layer (HTL) and cathode interfacial layer (CIL), respectively. Initially, the photovoltaic performance of the P:Y18-ID-based OSCs was optimized by using different weight ratios of P and Y18-ID. The P:Y18-ID-based devices showed the best PCE at a weight ratio of 1:1.5. The details of the photovoltaic parameters for different weight ratios are summarized in Table S2 (ESI†). The optimized active layer was then subjected to solvent vapor annealing (SVA) under a THF environment for different exposure times. The photovoltaic parameters for the SVA-treated P:Y18-ID (1:1.5) based OSCs with different exposure times are presented in Table S3 (ESI†). The current–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the as-cast and SVA-treated P:Y18-ID-based OSCs are shown in Fig. 7a, and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are presented in Table 2. The as-cast OSCs showed an overall PCE of 12.07% with a Jsc of 21.78 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.88 and FF of 0.63. After the SVA treatment, the PCE increased to 15.25% with a Jsc of 24.53 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.84 V and FF of 0.74.

The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the OSCs were examined to explore the spectral response of the devices, and are shown in Fig. 7b. The OSCs based on P:Y18-ID showed broad EQE spectra in the wavelength range of 350–970 nm, which closely resembles the absorption spectra of the P:Y18-ID blend (Fig. S8, ESI†). With the SVA treatment of active layer, the maximum EQE values of the OSCs reached about 80.7% at around 848 nm and they exhibited a broad response from 570 nm to 894 nm, which is superior to their as-cast counterpart. The Jsc values estimated from the integration of the EQE spectra were 21.64 mA cm−2 and 24.39 mA cm−2 for the as-cast OSCs and SVA-treated OSCs, respectively, which are very close to the Jsc values obtained from the J–V characteristics under illumination.
In order to investigate the effect of SVA treatment on the generation of excitons and their dissociation and charge collection kinetics in the P:Y18-ID-based OSCs, the exciton dissociation (Pdiss) and charge collection (Pcoll) probabilities56 were estimated through analysis of the Jph–Veff plots (Fig. 8). The photocurrent density (Jph) is defined as JL–JD, where JL and JD are the current densities under illumination and in the dark, respectively. The effective voltage (Veff) is expressed as Vo–Va, where Vo is the voltage at which Jph is zero. It can be seen from Fig. 8 that the Jph varies linearly with increasing Veff and is completely saturated to Jsat at Veff > 1.8 V, indicating that almost all of the photogenerated excitons are dissociated into free charge carriers and finally collected by the electrodes. The Pdiss and Pcoll values in the OSCs were estimated by the ratio of Jph/Jsat under short circuit conditions and maximum power point conditions, respectively. The estimated values of Pdiss/Pcoll were 0.952/0.79 and 0.978/0.84 for the as-cast and SVA-treated OSCs, respectively. The maximum exciton generation rate (Gmax) was estimated using the expression Gmax = Jsat/qL, where q is the elementary charge and L is the thickness of the active layer (95 nm). The values of Gmax are 1.50 × 1028 m−3 s−1 and 1.64 × 1028 m−3 s−1 for the as-cast and SVA-treated devices, respectively. The higher values of Pdiss, Pcoll and Gmax for the SVA-treated device compared to those of its as-cast counterpart are consistent with the trend observed in the Jsc values, which justifies the high fill factor (FF) values and Jsc for the SVA-treated OSCs.

In order to investigate the charge recombination mechanisms of the OSCs, the variation of Jsc and Voc with the illumination intensity (Pin) was studied, and is shown in Fig. 9a and b, respectively. Jsc can be fitted as a function of Pin with the expression Jsc ∝ (Pin)α, where α is the exponential factor and gives information about the degree of bimolecular recombination.57,58 When the value of α is unity, then all of the free charge carriers are swept out and collected by the electrodes prior to bimolecular recombination; any deviation in the value of α (<1) is associated with bimolecular recombination. The value of α for the SVA-treated OSCs (0.984) was higher than that of its as-cast counterpart (0.934), indicating that the degree of bimolecular recombination was suppressed by the SVA treatment of the active layer with improved nanoscale morphology and phase separation. Moreover, we plotted Voc as a function of Pin, as shown in Fig. 9b. The slope of Vocversus the natural logarithm of Pin gives the value of kT/q, where k, T and q are the Boltzmann constant, temperature in Kelvin and elementary charge, respectively. It was noted that the extracted value of the slope was slightly reduced from 1.21 kT/q for the as-cast devices to 1.16 kT/q for the SVA-treated devices. A greater slope of kT/q indicates that an additional mechanism, such as trap-assisted recombination, is involved in the device.58 The obtained lower slope demonstrated the reduced trap density and suppressed trap-assisted recombination in the SVA-treated devices.

The charge transport properties in the as-cast and SVA-treated blend films were measured by space charge limited current (SCLC)59 using hole-only and electron-only devices (Fig. S9, ESI†). The hole and electron mobilities for the as-cast blend were 3.96 × 10−4 and 2.82 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. After SVA treatment, these values increased to 4.98 × 10−4 and 4.22 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. Additionally, the ratio of the electron mobility to the hole mobility was reduced from 1.40 for the as-cast devices to 1.18 for the SVA-treated devices. This suggests more balanced charge transport, which is beneficial for achieving high Jsc and FF.

E
loss in an important factor that determines the overall PCE of the OSCs. We estimated the energy loss using the expression Eloss = Eg − qVoc, where Eg is taken from the onset of the incident EQE spectra of the OSCs, as reported in the literature.60 The optimized OSC showed an Eloss of 0.51 eV, which is one of the lowest energy loss values among OSCs using NFSMAs. It is well known that the Eloss of solar cells can be divided into three parts and expressed as30,61Eloss = (Eg − qVSQoc) + (qVSQoc − qVradoc) + (qVradoc − qVoc)
The qVSQoc in this expression is the maximum voltage based on the Shockley–Queissner (SQ) limit, where it is assumed that no IPCE is present below the optical gap. The first term is due to the radiative recombination associated with the absorption band gap, which is unavoidable in all solar cells. The second term corresponds to the additional radiative recombination originating from the absorption below the bandgap. The third term is due to the non-radiative loss, which depends on the LUMO and HOMO offsets between the donor and acceptor employed in the active layer of the device. We assume that the low value of Eloss originates from the suppressed non-radiative loss, which is related to the small values of the LUMO and HOMO offsets between P and Y18-ID.26,62,63 The low non-radiative loss may be a synergetic effect of the A–DA′D–A type molecular structures and the unique luminescence properties of the benzothiazole-based moiety. We have summarized the representation of Eloss in the OSCs based on non-fullerene acceptors (particularly Y-series acceptors) in Table S4 (ESI†).
Morphological investigations
The molecular ordering and packing properties of the active layer were investigated using X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns. As shown in Fig. S10 (ESI†), the pristine Y18-ID film shows a strong (010) π–π stacking peak at 2θ = 24.08° (π–π stacking distance = 0.369 nm) and a (100) lamellar diffraction peak at 2θ = 5.98° (lamellar distance = 1.48 nm). The XRD pattern of a pristine P film (Fig. S10, ESI†) also showed two diffraction peaks located at 2θ = 4.56° and 23.68°, which correspond to (100) lamellar (d-spacing = 1.94 nm) and π–π stacking (010) diffraction (d-spacing = 0.370 nm and 0.374 nm), respectively. In the case of the P:Y18-ID blend (Fig. 10), two different (100) peaks originating from the acceptor Y18-ID and donor P, and one (010) peak located at 2θ = 23.84° (d spacing = 0.373 nm), were observed, which may be a combination of (010) reflections from both Y18-ID and P. Compared to the as-cast blended film, its SVA-treated counterpart shows a stronger and sharper peak at 2θ = 23.98° (d-spacing = 0.370 nm), indicating that the crystallinity of the blended film increased and its π–π stacking spacing decreased, which is beneficial for charge transport and enhances the FF of the OSCs.

Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) images were scanned to obtain information about the morphology of the blended films, as shown in Fig. 11. The bright and dark domains in the TEM images were attributed to the polymer donor P and Y18-ID, respectively. Both the as-cast and SVA-treated blend films showed proper interpenetrating phase networks. The SVA-treated blend exhibited more appropriate interpenetrating networks, which contributed to the improvement in the values of both Jsc and FF.64

Conclusions
In brief, we have designed and synthesized a new A–DA′D–A type NFSMA, Y18-ID, with benzotriazole as the A′ core and hexyl-1H indole (ID) in place of the traditional 2-hexylthieno[3.2-b]thiophene (TT) D unit. Y18-ID was used as the acceptor in the OSCs, with the medium-bandgap conjugated polymer P as the donor. The P:Y18-ID blend has complementary absorption spectra. From analysis of the absorption and cyclic voltammetry data, we observed that Y18-ID showed extended absorption and a higher LUMO energy level. The optimized SVA-treated P:Y18-ID-based OSCs showed a high PCE of 15.25% with a very low energy loss of 0.51 eV. This work provides an opportunity for the energy loss to be further reduced by structural modification of A–DA′D–A type NFSMAs. We also believe that Y18-ID may become another important acceptor material for the OSC research community, and that its PCE can be further improved by using more appropriate conjugated polymers.
