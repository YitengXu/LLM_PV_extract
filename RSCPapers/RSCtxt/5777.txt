    , Accepted 19th September 2019First published on 20th September 2019AbstractNon-bias production of a bleach aqueous solution was successfully demonstrated using a solar-driven photoelectrochemical cell consisting of a metal-oxide-semiconductor photoanode and Pt-based cathode. Both hypochlorous acid (HClO) and hypobromous acid (HBrO) were generated via two-electron oxidation of chloride (Cl−) and bromide (Br−) at the photoanode. The faradaic efficiency for HBrO production gradually improved with increasing Br− concentration in the electrolyte solution. Although a certain amount of HBrO was produced from a 1 mM NaBr aqueous solution, the co-existence of Cl− drastically enhanced the amount of HBrO produced from the dilute Br− solution. The use of a gas diffusion electrode (GDE) composed of a Pt/carbon catalyst layer for efficient 4-electron O2 reduction enabled us to achieve the anodic photocurrent derived from the oxidation of Cl− and Br− under AM-1.5 simulated solar light irradiation. Moreover, we successfully accomplished convenient and simple production of aqueous bleach from artificial sea water via irradiating the photoanode with simulated solar light without applying external bias.
Introduction
The field of artificial photosynthesis is now facing a critical turning point, as it is necessary to develop systems with reasonable costs for practical applications in the near future.1–3 Compared to simple H2O splitting into H2 and O2 by photocatalytic or photoelectrochemical reactions, the production of high-value-added chemicals is more advantageous in terms of product value. For example, the extrinsic value of product per electron (photon) of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is over a hundred times higher than that of O2,4 indicating that a choice between the 2- and 4-electron oxidation of H2O in the (photo)electrochemical reaction can significantly impact the total cost of the process. Photogenerated holes in the valence band of heterogeneous photocatalysts immersed in an aqueous solution, which are positively charged, generally react with H2O to form O2 through a 4-electron oxidation. In many cases, O2 evolution is no more than a side reaction during H2 production from H2O. The photoinduced oxidation power is not used effectively in H2 production reactions based on the simple H2O splitting. Namely, it might waste oxidation power to produce the low-priced O2. Therefore, development of oxidation reactions that can achieve more effective utilization of solar light energy should be researched for next-generation photocatalysis. That is, effective conversion of oxidation power derived from solar-driven photocatalysis to high-value-added chemicals is a key technology enabling the improvement in solar energy utilization toward a sustainable society. In this context, our research group has reported pioneering studies on the photoelectrochemical oxidative production of high-value-added chemicals under simulated solar light irradiation, including hydrogen peroxide (H2O2),5–9 persulfate (SO52− and S2O82−),9–11 hypochlorous acid (HClO),12 oxidized cerium (Ce4+),9,13 and some organic compounds.14–16 During the oxidation reactions over a photoanode immersed in an aqueous solution, H2O oxidation to O2 must compete with high-value-added chemical production. In particular, irradiating BiVO4-based photoelectrodes in the presence of a bicarbonate (HCO3−) containing electrolyte solution caused selective H2O2 formation via 2-electron oxidation by suppressing the 4-electron oxidation (O2 evolution, E° = +1.23 V vs. SHE). This indicated that the thermodynamically unfavourable 2-electron oxidation (H2O2 formation, E° = +1.77 V vs. SHE) proceeds with high selectivity.5–9 Hypochlorous acid (HClO) was produced using this photoelectrochemical reaction at the BiVO4/WO3/FTO photoanode in the presence of chloride (Cl−), with an initial faradaic efficiency for HClO production of >97% (oxidation of H2O to O2 was thoroughly suppressed).12 Thus, the nature of the oxidation reactions on the surface of the photoanode depends on the anion species contained in the electrolyte solution. In addition, tuning of the reaction conditions may significantly contribute to increased high-value-added chemical production through efficient use of the oxidation power inherent in the photoelectrochemical reactions.4,9,17
Sea water electrolysis is a mature industrial process that is often combined with the alkali industry. Cl− contained in sea water is oxidized to Cl2 on the anode (eqn (1)), and the produced Cl2 is immediately converted to HClO in an aqueous solution via a disproportionation reaction (eqn (2)). At the cathode, H2 is produced via H2O reduction (eqn (3)) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) is formed in the electrolyte solution (eqn (4)). Therefore, the overall industrial process (eqn (5)) is referred to as the “Chlor-alkali process”.18–20 2Cl− → Cl2 + 2e−(1) Cl2 + H2O → HClO + Cl− + H+(2) 2H2O + 2e− → H2 + 2OH−(3) Na+ + OH− → NaOH(4) 2NaCl + 2H2O → Cl2 + H2 + 2NaOH(5)
The produced Cl2 species is commonly used as bleach due to its high oxidizing power in aqueous solution for the disinfection of drinking water, decolorization, deodorization, and food sterilization.21 Because of the strong demand for the Chlor-alkali process, a large amount of electric power is consumed for sea water electrolysis.22,23 Bromide (Br−) is an important anion species in sea water with an average concentration of 68 ppm, and the oxidation product of Br− (hypobromous acid (HBrO)) can be used as a disinfectant.24 HBrO formation is described in eqn (6) and (7) and is similar to Cl− oxidation. 2Br− → Br2 + 2e−(6) Br2 + H2O → HBrO + Br− + H+(7)
It is well-known that the stability of HBrO in an aqueous solution is higher than that of HClO over a broader pH range,25 suggesting that it can be widely used as a disinfectant in various environments. Although the use of HBrO for sterilizing edible meat in the U.S. and some other countries is permitted, the chemical process for HBrO production is currently limited. Thus, developments in effective HBrO production techniques from sea water are urgently needed. Meanwhile, improved energy conversion efficiency of the Chlor-alkali process can be achieved by applying 4-electron O2 reduction as the cathode reaction instead of H2 production.23 The applied voltage required to operate the Chlor-alkali process was drastically decreased by abandoning H2 production. The total reaction of this modified Chlor-alkali process can be described in eqn (8). 4NaCl + O2 + 2H2O → 2Cl2 + 4NaOH(8)
From the point of view of whole system costs, dark electrolysis combined with photovoltaics for bleach production from sea water should be more expensive than direct photoelectrolysis due to the high-priced photovoltaics part. Therefore, the standalone direct photoelectrolysis of sea water must be suitable for niche uses. Thus, this study was performed to produce high-value-added chemicals (HClO and HBrO) by non-bias photoelectrolysis from sea water using O2 from the air and solar light, which are abundant resources.
Experimental
Preparation of the electrodes
A BiVO4/WO3/FTO photoelectrode was fabricated by spin-coating following the methods described previously.5–9,12,14,15 Three precursor solutions, (a) 1.0 g of tungsten hexachloride (WCl6, Kojundo Chemical Laboratory Co., Ltd., Japan) in 5 mL of dimethyl formamide (DMF, Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd., Japan), (b) 0.5 g of WCl6 in 5 mL of DMF, and (c) a mixed solution of bismuth oxide (Symetrix Co., USA) and vanadium oxide (Symetrix Co., USA) precursors (molar ratio of Bi/V = 1) in ethyl acetate (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd., Japan) containing ethyl cellulose (Sigma-Aldrich Co. LLC, USA), were coated sequentially on an FTO substrate (Nippon Sheet Glass Co., Ltd., 24 mm × 60 mm). Prior to coating, the FTO substrate was rinsed with pure water, ethanol, and ethyl acetate and subsequently polished in an ultraviolet (UV)-ozone cleaning system (PL1101N-14, Filgen Inc., Japan) for 30 min. A gas diffusion electrode (GDE) for the cathodic 4-electron O2 reduction was used (MICLAB, Japan), containing a Pt/C catalyst (TEC10E50E, Tanaka Kikinzoku Kogyo (TKK), Japan) loaded with 0.5 mg Pt per cm2 on carbon paper (E-525, KUREHA CORPORATION, Japan). A tetrafluoroethylene-ethylene copolymer (FEP) resin solution (FEP 120-JR, Du Pont-Mitsui Fluorochemicals, Japan) was coated on the opposite side of the carbon paper to form a water-repellent surface. Before application to the photoelectrochemical reaction, a 2 wt% Nafion© dispersion (ethanol solvent) was coated on the surface of the Pt/C catalyst-GDE assembly and dried at 413 K under an ambient air atmosphere.
Photoelectrochemical HBrO production
Oxidative photoelectrochemical HBrO production was performed under simulated solar light irradiation using the prepared BiVO4/WO3/FTO multilayer photoelectrode (irradiation area: ∼12.0 cm2) as the photoanode in a two-electrode photoelectrochemical cell. The anode and cathode chambers of the Pyrex-glass divided cell were separated using an ion-exchange membrane (SELEMION™, AGC Engineering Co., Ltd.). An aqueous solution of sodium bromide (NaBr, Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd., Japan) containing sodium perchlorate (NaClO4, Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd., Japan) or sodium chloride (NaCl, Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd., Japan) as support salts was used as the electrolyte solution for both anode and cathode chambers. The concentration of NaBr was varied from 1.0 to 500 mM. The (500 − x) mM NaClO4 or NaCl aqueous solution containing x mM NaBr is denoted as Br(x)ClO4(500 − x) or Br(x)Cl(500 − x), respectively. For example, Br(5)Cl(495) refers to a mixed electrolyte solution containing 5.0 mM NaBr and 495 mM NaCl (the total salt concentration, [Na+] + [Cl−] + [Br−] + [ClO4−], was maintained at 1000 mM). The BiVO4/WO3/FTO photoanode was immersed in 35 mL of an aqueous electrolyte solution and illuminated under simulated solar light (SAN-EI Electric Co., XES-151S). Prior to the experiments, the intensity of the solar simulator was calibrated to AM-1.5 (1 SUN, 100 mW cm−2) using a spectroradiometer (SOMA Optics, Ltd., S2440). An electrochemical potentio- and galvano-stat (BAS. Inc., ALS660B) was used to control and monitor the anodic photocurrent and applied external bias to the photoanode versus the cathode (Pt wire). The cathode chamber was filled with O2 gas using a continuous flow to improve the reaction (4-electron O2 reduction) at the Pt cathode. For the Br(x)ClO4(500 − x) system, HBrO may be the sole oxidation product in the liquid phase. Therefore, the N,N-diethyl-p-phenylenediamine (DPD) method26 was used to determine the concentration of HBrO produced in the anolyte solution (CHBrO). The measurement conditions were the same as those for HClO production, as previously reported.12 For the Br(x)Cl(500 − x) system, both HBrO and HClO should be produced as oxidation products. The DPD method was used to determine the total concentration of HBrO and HClO in the electrolyte solution (CHBrO + CHClO). CHBrO was determined using the absorption of the aqueous solution of HBrO (Fig. S1†). As shown in Fig. S2,† the absorption at 425 nm was linearly correlated with the concentration of HBrO in the aqueous solution. Therefore, the concentration of HClO (CHClO) was calculated using the difference between CHBrO + CHClO and CHBrO. The faradaic efficiencies of HClO (FEHClO) and HBrO production (FEHBrO) were calculated based on CHClO and CHBrO, respectively (eqn. (9) and (10)). FEHClO (%) = 100 × CHClO × V × F × 2/(charge passed)(9) FEHBrO (%) = 100 × CHBrO × V × F × 2/(charge passed)(10)V: volume of the electrolyte solution/L, F: Faraday constant/C mol−1, charge passed: number of charges passed/C
Setup for non-bias production of bleach
Solar-light-driven non-bias production of bleach from sea water was demonstrated using a one-chamber photoelectrochemical cell (composed of acrylic resin) consisting of two electrodes. As shown in Fig. S3,† the BiVO4/WO3/FTO photoelectrode and Nafion-coated GDE assembly were arranged facing each other as an anode and a cathode, respectively. O2 from the air was supplied to the Pt/C catalyst layer through the gas diffusion layer (GDL) under ambient pressure and reduced via 4-electron reduction over the Pt/C cathode catalyst. A total of 13 mL of the aqueous electrolyte solution (Br(1)Cl(499), Cl(500), or artificial sea water) filled the space between the electrodes. Artificial sea water was prepared from the commercial powdered sea water MARINE ART SF-1 (Osaka Yakken. Co. Ltd., Japan). The concentrations of ions contained in the artificial sea water are listed in Table S1.† The photoelectrochemical cell was illuminated using a calibrated solar simulator without applying an external bias under an ambient air atmosphere. The concentration of products (HClO and HBrO) produced in the electrolyte solution and their corresponding faradaic efficiencies were separately determined using the above-mentioned techniques.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1 shows the time course of the HBrO concentration in the electrolyte solution (CHBrO) and corresponding faradaic efficiency for HBrO production (FEHBrO) during the photoelectrochemical reaction under solar light irradiation in a 5.0 M NaBr aqueous solution. The initial FEHBrO 100 s after photoirradiation was >95%, and it gradually decreased after 500 s. This initial FEHBrO was higher than that reported by Grätzel et al.17 After photoirradiation for 2000 s, the BiVO4/WO3/FTO photoanode continuously produced 800 μM HBrO aqueous solution with high selectivity (FEHBrO = ∼80%). Moreover, the concentration of HBrO in the electrolyte solution reached 4500 μM after 8 h of photoirradiation (Fig. S4†). The anolyte solution turned yellow after the reaction, as shown in Fig. S1(e).† These results indicated that the thermodynamically favoured H2O oxidation (E° = +1.23 V vs. SHE) was suppressed and Br− oxidation occurred under photoirradiation upon application of an external bias. Although Br2 and its derivatives are industrially produced from aqueous solutions of NaBr, high concentrations of NaBr as a Br− source for HBrO production cannot be used. Therefore, effective HBrO production from a dilute Br− solution must be achieved. Fig. 2 shows the effect of Br− concentration on the faradaic efficiency for HBrO production (FEHBrO) in the photoelectrochemical reactions using the BiVO4/WO3/FTO photoanode. The total ion concentration (Na+, Br−, and ClO4−) was maintained at 1000 mM by adding NaClO4. The value of FEHBrO after galvanostatic electrolysis at 3.0 mA for 1000 s under simulated solar light irradiation was approximately 80% when NaBr aqueous solutions with concentrations >50 mM were used as the electrolyte solution. The other 20% of the faradaic efficiency was consumed by O2 evolution via 4-electron H2O oxidation and/or thermal decomposition of the produced HBrO into O2 and Br−, as previously reported for Cl− oxidation during HClO production under similar reaction conditions.12 The non-(photo)electrochemical decomposition rate of HBrO in NaBr aqueous solution, measured in the absence of the electrodes, was accelerated under these reaction conditions, and around 20% of HBrO was decomposed during 3600 s (Fig. S5†). From the enlarged view of the low Br− concentration region (Fig. 2), the faradaic efficiency for HBrO production gradually deteriorated with decreasing Br− concentration. However, the photogenerated holes of the BiVO4/WO3/FTO photoanode oxidized Br− in the 1 mM Br− electrolyte solution (molar ratio of Br−:H2O = 1:55555), indicating that Br− oxidation via 2-electron oxidation is much easier for H2O than via 4-electron oxidation. High selectivity toward Br− oxidation was indicated by the I–V curves of the BiVO4/WO3/FTO photoanode, as shown in Fig. 3. The I–V curve in Br(500) exhibited a larger anodic photocurrent than that in ClO4(500), and the onset potential was clearly shifted to a lower external bias. Consequently, it can be concluded that Br− oxidation preferentially occurs over H2O oxidation in this photoelectrochemical reaction. The anodic photocurrent obtained in Br(1)ClO4(499) was slightly larger at approximately 0.5 V of external bias than that in ClO4(500). This is consistent with the results shown in Fig. 2, where some of the electrolyte solution (Br−) was oxidized over the BiVO4/WO3/FTO photoanode immersed in 1 mM Br−. For Br(7)ClO4(493), the slope of the I–V curve in the large photocurrent region differed from that in the small photocurrent region. It is likely that the diffusion limitation of Br− significantly affected the I–V curve. Br(7)ClO4(493) showed a similar trend to that of Br(50)ClO4(450) in the small photocurrent region and a similar slope to that of ClO4(500) in the large photocurrent region.

Table S2† compares the faradaic efficiencies of HClO (FEHClO) and HBrO (FEHBrO) production in various concentration of Cl−/ClO4− and Br−/ClO4− electrolyte solutions for galvanostatic photoelectrolysis at 3.0 mA. Br(200)ClO4(300) and Br(100)ClO4(400) resulted in high FEHBrO (>80%), while the FEHClO values were 58% and 41% for Cl− oxidation at the same concentrations as those for Br−. Moreover, significant differences in the faradaic efficiencies were observed between Cl(10)ClO4(490) and Br(10)ClO4(490) where FEHBrO was 15 times higher than FEHClO, indicating that Br− is more easily oxidized at the same concentration. Fig. 4(a), (c) and (f) corresponding to ClO4(500), Cl(500), and Br(500) show differences in the onset potential of the anodic photocurrent and I–V characteristics. This clearly indicated the disparity in the standard oxidation potential of H2O, Cl−, and Br−. Fig. 4 indicates that the ionic components in the electrolyte solution affect the onset potential of the anodic photocurrent, and their concentrations significantly affect the magnitude of the photocurrent. Differences between Br− and Cl− oxidation were observed when using FTO and Pt wire anodes. Thus, the photoelectrochemical reaction on the BiVO4 photocatalyst surface is not particularly unique in this regard (Fig. S6†). Furthermore, these differences were more significant when the Br− and Cl− concentrations in the electrolyte solution were low. These results are consistent with the faradaic efficiencies in the photoelectrochemical production of HBrO and HClO listed in Table S2.† As shown in Fig. S7A,† solar light irradiation on the BiVO4/WO3/FTO photoanode enabled the drastic diminishment of the external bias to induce 3 mA of photocurrent in the Br(50)ClO4(450) solution from 2.2 to 0.6 V (see the difference between Fig. S7A(a) and (e)†). Photoelectrolysis under solar light irradiation is more advantageous compared to typical electrolysis under dark conditions. WO3/FTO (without the BiVO4 layer) exhibited insufficient anodic photocurrent in Br(50)Cl(450) solution, indicating that the photogenerated holes on the valence band of the BiVO4 photocatalyst in the BiVO4/WO3/FTO composite mainly reacted with Cl− or Br− in this system. As shown in Fig. S8A,† the light harvesting efficiency difference between the BiVO4/WO3/FTO and WO3/FTO was directly reflected in their I–V characteristics. Moreover, the onset potential of the anodic photocurrent for BiVO4/FTO (without the WO3 layer) was much more positive than that for BiVO4/WO3/FTO. On the other hand, FEHBrO was not influenced by the insertion of the WO3 layer (there is no difference between Fig. S7B(a) and (c)†). As previously reported,7 the photogenerated electrons on the BiVO4 photocatalyst are transported to the FTO conductive substrate through the WO3 layer. That is, the BiVO4 and WO3 layers can be referred to as the “photocatalyst layer” and “electron transporting layer”, respectively. The I–V characteristics of the bare FTO substrate under solar light irradiation were similar to those of the BiVO4/WO3/FTO photoanode under dark conditions, indicating that the FTO substrate itself did not participate in generating photocurrent. In contrast, Fig. S8A† shows a certain LHE value at approximately >500 nm corresponding to light scattering. Furthermore, the faradaic efficiency for HBrO production (FEHBrO) in galvanostatic electrolysis at 3.0 mA did not show a meaningful difference between the photoelectrochemical and dark electrochemical reactions (Fig. S7B(a) and (e)†). As shown in Fig. S8B,† the irradiation wavelength did not affect FEHBrO in galvanostatic photoelectrolysis using the BiVO4/WO3/FTO, indicating that photogenerated charges on the BiVO4 photocatalyst have a significant role in HBrO production, which is consistent with the other results presented here.

Although the use of high Br− concentrations in the electrolyte solution may result in effective bleach production during the photoelectrochemical reaction over BiVO4/WO3/FTO, the Br− concentration in sea water is insufficient to be utilized as a reaction substrate. Fig. 5 shows the effect of Cl− on HBrO production by the photoelectrochemical reaction under simulated solar light irradiation. Both Br(50)Cl(450) and Br(50)ClO4(450) showed similar FEHBrO regardless of the co-present anion (Cl− or ClO4−), indicating that a 50 mM Br− electrolyte solution was sufficient for oxidation by the photogenerated holes. In other words, the photogenerated holes directly oxidized Br− to Br2 (HBrO) in both systems. In contrast, clear differences in FEHBrO were observed for Br(1) and Br(5). Br(1)Cl(499) and Br(5)Cl(495) showed higher faradaic efficiency than Br(1)ClO4(499) and Br(5)ClO4(495). In particular, FEHBrO in Br(1)Cl(499) solution was >70% at a molar ratio of Br−:Cl−:H2O = 1:499:55555, and Cl− addition to the Br(1) solution improved HBrO production by a factor of 7. These results indicated that the co-presence of Cl− enhanced HBrO production during the photoelectrochemical oxidation of dilute Br− on the BiVO4/WO3/FTO photoelectrode. The anodic photocurrent in the Br(5)Cl(495) electrolyte solution did not deteriorate during photoirradiation for 2000 s, as shown in Fig. 6. The total faradaic efficiency for the high-value-added products (FEHClO + FEHBrO) after photoirradiation for 100 s was nearly 100%, indicating that the photogenerated holes can oxidize Cl− and Br− preferentially over H2O (CHBrO:CHClO = 75:25). However, the total faradaic efficiency FEHClO + FEHBrO gradually decreased with the increasing reaction time. We previously reported that photo- or thermal-decomposition of HClO results in the formation of Cl− and O2 according to eqn (11), and the decreased FEHClO during photoelectrochemical HClO production is mainly caused by decomposition of the produced HClO.12 2HClO → O2 + 2Cl− + 2H+(11)

Potentiostatic photoelectrolysis at +0.7 V vs. the counter electrode for 2000 s. Light source: AM 1.5 simulated solar light. Anode: BiVO4/WO3/FTO 12 cm2. Cathode: Pt wire (O2 atmosphere). 
Therefore, it should be noted that the deterioration of the total faradaic efficiency FEHClO + FEHBrO originated from the decomposition of the produced HClO and HBrO in the electrolyte solution. In contrast, the fraction of HBrO produced (calculated as: CHBrO/(CHClO + CHBrO)) gradually improved with increasing reaction time, reaching almost 100% after photoirradiation for 1000 s. Thus, it was considered that HBrO was produced by two passes in parallel; a direct pass (eqn (12a) and (12b)) and an indirect pass27 (eqn (13a)–(c)). 2Br− + 2h+ → Br2(12a) Br2 + H2O → HBrO + Br− + H+(12b) 2Cl− + 2h+ → Cl2(13a) Cl2 + H2O → HClO + Cl− + H+(13b) Br− + HClO → HBrO + Cl−(13c)
Although Br− can be directly oxidized by the photogenerated holes with higher priority than Cl−, Cl− oxidation (eqn (13a)) should compete with direct Br− oxidation (eqn (12a)) at a Br−/Cl− ratio in the electrolyte solution of 5/495. Hence, the redox reaction HClO/Br− (eqn (13c)) will significantly contribute to HBrO formation under these conditions. For sea water containing Br− and Cl− with a ratio of Br−/Cl− of 0.83/547 (=1/659), the co-presence of Cl− should provide a further benefit for HBrO production via the photoelectrochemical reaction using the BiVO4/WO3/FTO photoelectrode.
Herein, non-bias photoelectrochemical production of bleach (HClO and HBrO) was demonstrated under an ambient air atmosphere and temperature using a BiVO4/WO3/FTO photoelectrode immersed in artificial sea water. At neutral pH, ΔG of the total reaction is slightly positive at +52 kJ mol−1 (eqn (14) and (15)), indicating that this HBrO production is a potential artificial photosynthesis process where solar light energy is directly converted to chemical energy via a photoelectrochemical reaction. 2Br− + 2h+ → Br2, E° = +1.09 V (vs. NHE at pH = 7)(14) O2 + 4H+ + 4e− → 2H2O, E° = +0.82 V (vs. NHE at pH = 7)(15)
As shown in Fig. S9(A),† the I–V characteristics of the BiVO4/WO3/FTO photoanode varied depending on the cathode. The GDE assembly cathode in the undivided cell enabled the largest photocurrent compared to the Pt wire cathode and the divided cell with an ion exchange membrane. Therefore, the GDE assembly cathode is suitable for the non-bias photoelectrochemical reaction. Herein, a very simple single-chamber electrochemical cell (undivided cell) equipped with a GDE assembly cathode was used for the non-bias experiments (Fig. S3†), with regard to the fact that reaction selectivity FEHBrO was not influenced by the cathode conditions (Fig. S9(B)†). O2 in the air can be effectively supplied to the Pt/C catalyst layer of the GDE assembly cathode through the gas diffusion layer and reduced to H2O by 4-electron reduction, as described in eqn (15). Table 1 summarizes the results of non-bias photoelectrochemical bleach production from artificial sea water and Br(1)Cl(499), and Cl(500) electrolyte solutions. After photoelectrolysis for 1 h (3600 s) in artificial sea water, 2.2C charge was induced by solar light irradiation under non-bias conditions, and HClO and HBrO were produced with 21% total faradaic efficiency (FEHClO + FEHBrO). The concentration of the produced bleach (CHClO and CHBrO) was ∼180 μM, which was sufficient for use as a disinfectant. Compared to the Cl(500) system (FEHClO 32% and CHClO 242 μM), bleach production from sea water was comparable considering that unrefined sea water can be used as is. Br(1)Cl(499) contains slightly more Br− than sea water, which may cause large photocurrents, as shown in Fig. S10.† The difference in Br− concentration likely influences the total faradaic efficiency and CHBrO. Accordingly, we successfully obtained an anodic photocurrent at 0.0 V (non-bias condition) for sea water derived from the oxidation of Cl− and Br− (Fig. S10(d)†). That is, the “non-bias” production of bleach (mixture of HClO and HBrO) from sea water, air, and simulated solar light was achieved by converting light to chemical energy on the BiVO4/WO3/FTO photoanode.

Volume of the electrolyte solution: 13 mL. Cathode: Pt/C loaded GDE. The total amount of products (HClO + HBrO) was determined by the DPD method. The HBrO concentration (CHBrO) was evaluated from the absorbance of the electrolyte solution itself at 425 nm

Conclusions
Hypobromous acid (HBrO) was successfully produced via a photoelectrochemical reaction using a BiVO4/WO3/FTO photoelectrode immersed in a NaBr aqueous electrolyte solution. Although the faradaic efficiency of HBrO production was clearly influenced by the Br− concentration in the electrolyte solution, it remained >70% when Br(10)ClO4(490) was used. The co-presence of Cl− significantly improved HBrO production from Br−, indicating that HBrO was produced via two major reaction passes: (1) direct oxidation of Br− by photogenerated holes and (2) HClO produced from Cl− oxidized Br−. Moreover, aqueous bleach (HClO and HBrO) production from sea water was achieved under mild conditions including an ambient air atmosphere, room temperature, non-bias, and artificial solar light, which are abundant and easily accessible.
