    , Accepted 11th June 2021First published on 28th June 2021AbstractThe elimination of reactive oxygen species (ROS) caused by glutathione (GSH) is a fundamental concern in the oxidative stress therapy (OST) of tumors. This is the first report of copper phosphate nanospheres coated by poly (ethylene glycol) diacrylate (Cu3(PO4)2@PEGDA) which act as nanozymes to amplify the anti-tumor effects of OST. Cu3(PO4)2@PEGDA not only catalyzes the generation of ˙OH from H2O2 but also consumes GSH, which is counterproductive to the role of ˙OH. Moreover, the photothermal properties of Cu3(PO4)2@PEGDA further enhances the outcome of the OST when exposed to an 808 nm laser. Another novelty lies in that a new PEGylation strategy of peroxidase-like nanozymes is proposed, in which the Cu3(PO4)2 cores work as internal heaters and radical generators, which are necessary to initiate the radical polymerization of PEGDA. An elaborate core–shell nanostructure is obtained since the polymerization prefers to take place in the vicinity of the cores, overcoming the drawbacks of traditional PEGylation methods which include invalid polymerization far away from the cores and easy core–shell disassembly during applications.
Introduction
Materials with enzyme-like properties always attract considerable attention and can be used for H2O2 detection,1–4 immunoassays,5,6 cancer treatment,7,8etc. With the development of nanotechnology, nanozymes, which can overcome the disadvantages of natural enzymes such as their difficult extraction, poor stability and difficult storage,9 have become a hot topic in the field of enzyme mimics. Various factors have been comprehensively considered to develop target products in the most economical way.10 Since the first discovery of the peroxidase activity of Fe2O3 by the Yan team in 2007,6 various nanoparticles have been found to be enzyme-like, such as V2O5,11 Au,12 graphene oxides13 and Cu-MOFs.3 The generation of hydroxyl radicals (˙OH) from H2O2, catalyzed by peroxidases, usually involves the valence change of transition metal ions. For example, the Fenton effect of Fe2+ (eqn (1)) is the result of the special electronic structure which endows the iron-containing nanoparticles with satisfactory catalytic performance. Fe2+ + H2O2 → Fe3+ + ˙OH(1)Superior to natural enzymes, nanozymes exhibit much better physical stability and large-scale feasibility. Using the Fenton-type reactions of peroxidase nanozymes to generate highly cytotoxic ˙OH, which are the most active reactive oxygen species (ROS), is an emerging method of killing tumors called OST.7 Recently, iron-based nanozymes have been reported to kill cancer as OST agents, such as the FePOs nanozyme,14 Fe-HPPy@Au/DOX nanocomposites,15 Ir@MnFe2O4 NPs16 and the Fe-POM cluster.17 However, the Fenton-type reaction of most iron-based nanozymes is only effective under relatively strong acidic conditions (pH 3.0–5.0),18 while the Fenton-type reaction is not activated under neutral physiological conditions or the weakly acidic tumor microenvironment (TME).19–21 The copper ion-mediated Fenton-type reaction can occur with high efficiency in neutral media and the TME and the highest reaction rate is about a 160 fold22,23 increase over that catalyzed by Fe2+, according to recent literature.21
Generally, a big concern involved in OST is the elimination of ROS caused by glutathione (GSH), which is widely distributed in cells.24 GSH is essential in regulating biological functions, e.g., maintaining the homeostasis of redox states, modulating the immune response, intracellular signal transduction, growth and metabolic function.25,26 In particular, oxidative stress damages are eliminated to a large extent by the high GSH concentration within cancer cells, which results in a strong resistance to radiotherapy, chemotherapy and OST.16,21,27 In this work, we propose that this problem might be solved by copper-based nanomaterials which not only catalyze the production of ROS, which are crucial for tumor development, but also deplete GSH levels in cancer cells. Specifically, bivalent copper ions (Cu2+) are reduced by GSH to monovalent copper (Cu+) which can lead to even more elevated oxidative stress than Cu2+ in cancers. On the one hand, a decrease in the level of GSH can diminish the ROS scavenging ability of the cancer cells; on the other hand, the production of ROS is highly efficiently catalyzed due to the elevated concentration of Cu(I) caused by the Cu(II)–GSH redox reaction.28
In addition, copper-containing compounds usually exhibit excellent photothermal properties and many of them have been used as photothermal agents in tumor photothermal therapy (PTT).19,29 The 3d electrons of the Cu element split in the d orbital energy levels in different coordination fields, forming abundant energy levels. The d–d transition of electrons in the energy levels, which happens after the copper-containing materials absorb energy, results in strong absorption in the visible–NIR region30 followed by efficient light-to-heat conversion. What's more, increasing the local temperature of the tumor is often used as one of the most common strategies to improve the efficiency of the Fenton-type reaction in OST and it is widely employed due to its simplicity and practicality.19 Thus, a more effective copper-containing GSH depleting agent which can mediate an adjunctive therapy needs to be developed for cancer treatment.
Trace copper ions play a critical role in organisms, such as cellular energy production, central neuromodulation, blood clotting and oxygen transport. Copper superoxide dismutase can reduce the free radical levels31 and modulate the oxidant–antioxidant balance of organisms. Nevertheless, excessive exogenous copper ions are detrimental to biological systems.29 Therefore, the biomedical applications of copper-containing substances are limited due to toxicity issues. In order to allow for their clinical applications, it is urgent to develop a universal strategy to improve the biocompatibility of copper-containing nanoparticles. Particle surface modification by biocompatible polymers is a commonly used protocol to eliminate the toxicity of inorganic nanoparticles. PEG, which has excellent biocompatibility and has been approved by the FDA for in vivo use in humans,32 is one of the most widely used surface modifiers for nanoparticles. The novelty of this study lies in that we develop a new PEGylation strategy of inorganic enzyme-like nanoparticles via utilizing their peroxidase mimicking activity. A great number of studies are available in which nanoparticles are modified by PEG merely via physical adsorption. Due to the weak forces involved in physical adsorption, PEG layers are not as stable as expected. It is necessary to develop new protocols for PEGylation. Peroxidases have been proven to be effective catalysts for the free radical polymerization of vinyl monomers, non-phenolic aromatic compounds, etc.33 It is reasonable to use a peroxidase-like nanozyme as a catalyst to initiate the free radical polymerization of PEG monomers. This method may improve the stability of the PEG coating layer compared to traditional protocols via physical adsorption. Herein, we develop a new PEGylation method of peroxidase-like nanoparticles based on this mechanism. We fabricate peroxidase-like photothermal copper phosphate (Cu3(PO4)2) nanospheres, followed by the in situ polymerization of PEGDA with the assistance of H2O2 and an 808 nm NIR laser. The PEGDA layer protects the Cu3(PO4)2 from uncontrolled degradation and hence greatly improves the biocompatibility of the nanozyme. Compared to OST mediated by ordinary nanozymes, the anti-tumor effects are amplified, benefiting from the GSH-depleting, peroxidase-like and photothermal tri-functionality of the prepared Cu3(PO4)2@PEGDA nanozyme (Scheme 1).

Results and discussion
Composition and morphology characterization of Cu3(PO4)2 and the Cu3(PO4)2@PEGDA nanozyme
The results of the composition and morphology characterization of the products are summarized in Fig. 1. The SEM (Fig. 1a and b) and TEM (Fig. 1c) images demonstrate that the un-modified Cu3(PO4)2 product was made up of uniform monodispersed spherical particles. The high-resolution TEM image (Fig. S1, ESI†) and the XRD pattern (Fig. S2, ESI†) both indicate the amorphous nature of the colloidal nanospheres. The SEM images of the modified products (Fig. 1d and e) show that the in situ polymerization of PEGDA did not greatly change the spherical morphology and the size of the prepared nanozyme. PEGDA was used to PEGylate the Cu3(PO4)2 nanospheres not only because of its wide biomedical applications, but also because of its radical polymerization initiated by ˙OH radicals from H2O2. This inspired us to perform the in situ polymerization of PEGDA on the Cu3(PO4)2 nanospheres since peroxidase is just the catalyst to catalyze ˙OH generation from H2O2. Therefore, the immediate vicinity of Cu3(PO4)2 nanospheres was rich in ˙OH, which confined PEGDA polymerization to the surface region of the nanospheres. In order to further promote in situ PEGDA polymerization, we exposed the Cu3(PO4)2 nanospheres to an 808 nm laser. Owing to their photothermal properties, the nanospheres worked as internal heaters and made it easier for the PEGDA to polymerize on the surface region. In the TEM image of the modified products (Fig. 1f), a nearly transparent shell with a thickness of about 7–8 nm is clearly visible, indicating the successful surface coating of PEGDA on the nanospheres. Correspondingly, the average hydration diameter of the spheres increased from 382.0 nm to 656.6 nm, as shown in the DLS size distribution plots (Fig. 1g). This can be attributed to the interaction between the PEGDA shells and water molecules in aqueous solution. In addition, the appearance of some characteristic peaks, such as CH2, in the FT-IR spectrum can be attributed to PEGDA (Fig. 1h) and the change in zeta potential (Fig. S3, ESI†) also proves the presence of the PEGDA layer. Taken together, these results verified the feasibility of the surface coating protocol via in situ polymerization catalyzed by the peroxidase-like nanospheres themselves.

XPS analysis was performed on the un-modified sample for further information on the chemical composition and the results are given in Fig. 1i–l, in which the binding energies have been standardized by referencing C 1s to 284.8 eV. The XPS survey spectrum (Fig. 1i) shows that the sample was mainly composed of Cu, P and O elements. In the high-resolution spectrum (Fig. 1j) of Cu 2p, the two peaks at 934.6 eV and 954.7 eV were assigned to Cu 2p3/2 and 2p1/2, respectively. In addition, the corresponding satellite peaks were obviously observed at 943.6 eV and 962.7 eV, which indicate the +2 state of Cu.21Fig. 1k and l show the bonding energies corresponding to P 2p (132.6 eV) and O 1s (530.9 eV) in the phosphate material, respectively, which indicate the existence of phosphate groups in the products and are in good agreement with the reported values.34 According to the peak area and relative sensitivity factors (RSF) shown in Table S1 (ESI†), the corresponding atomic number ratio of Cu, P and O was calculated as 3:2:9, and the chemical formula of the product was considered to be Cu3(PO4)2. Excess oxygen may be present in the hydrate H2O.
Peroxidase activity and photothermal properties of Cu3(PO4)2 and the Cu3(PO4)2@PEGDA nanozyme
The oxidation reaction of luminol by H2O2 was used to investigate the catalytic mechanism of the prepared nanozyme. Luminol is an organic compound that exhibits chemiluminescence when oxidized by H2O2, emitting blue light at ∼428 nm. Natural peroxidase can efficiently catalyze the oxidation of luminol by catalyzing H2O2 decomposition into ˙OH radicals.35Fig. 2a–c show the chemical luminescent spectra of luminol recorded in different cases. After H2O2 was added, the chemiluminescence (CL) intensity of luminol continued to increase within the first 30 min (Fig. 2a), suggesting the continuous oxidation of luminol caused by ˙OH generation from H2O2. The largest intensity value was measured to be ∼370. This process was greatly enhanced by the addition of Cu3(PO4)2 nanospheres (Fig. 2c), in which the intensity value quickly jumped to ∼3800 as soon as H2O2 was added into the luminol–Cu3(PO4)2 system. Since no luminescence could be detected for the luminol–Cu3(PO4)2 system in the absence of H2O2 (Fig. 2b), it is reasonable to ascribe this catalytic phenomenon to the Cu3(PO4)2–H2O2 interaction. The CL spectrum of the oxidized luminol product was very similar to that obtained with HRP as the catalyst.35 So we concluded that Cu3(PO4)2 could catalyze the luminol–H2O2 redox reaction in a similar manner to HRP. Cu3(PO4)2 also catalyzed the decomposition of H2O2 into ˙OH radicals. The rapid depletion of the luminescence observed in Fig. 2c suggests the well-known short life-time of ROS. In order to further study the Fenton-like reaction of Cu3(PO4)2, the time-dependent absorbance changes at 650 nm of the TMB–H2O2–Cu3(PO4)2 reaction system were monitored. The initial absorbance against time plots, shown in Fig. 2d and e, indicate typical Michaelis–Menten kinetics displayed by the TMB–H2O2 reactions catalyzed by the Cu3(PO4)2 nanozyme. The slopes of these plots can be calculated from the initial reaction rates at different concentrations of substrate. By plotting the reaction rate against the concentration (Fig. 2g and h) and using the nonlinear regression of the Michaelis–Menten equation (eqn (2)), the catalytic parameters of Km and Vmax were obtained (Table 1). The Km value of the Cu3(PO4)2 nanozyme with TMB as the substrate was calculated to be 0.73 mM, which is lower than that reported for horseradish peroxidase (HRP, 3.7 mM36), indicating that the prepared Cu3(PO4)2 has a higher affinity for TMB than HRP. Compared with that of HRP, the Km value of the Cu3(PO4)2 nanozyme with H2O2 as the substrate is significantly higher. (2)According to the coordination field theory,37 the absorption of transition metal ions in the NIR region can be attributed to the d–d transition of electrons in the split low orbitals. The photothermal performances and applications in solar evaporation of hierarchical copper phosphates (HCuPO) were firstly reported by our group.38 In this work, we focused on the light-to-heat conversion of the nanoscale spherical copper phosphates under NIR light with the purpose of developing a new photothermal therapy agent for biomedical applications. As shown in Fig. 2f, the absorption peak was located in the biological transparent NIR window (in the range of 650–1350 nm). Fig. 2i shows the temperature rise of the Cu3(PO4)2–water dispersion under different test conditions. As the power density of the 808 nm laser increased from 0.5 to 2.0 W cm−2, the temperature increase of deionized water was only 3.2 °C, while a sharp rise of 11.2–38.1 °C was observed for the Cu3(PO4)2–water dispersions with different concentrations from 1.25–7.5 mg mL−1, indicating the excellent photothermal properties of the prepared Cu3(PO4)2 nanospheres. With a laser power density equal to 2.0 W cm−2, the concentration increment of Cu3(PO4)2 from 1.25 to 7.5 mg mL−1 caused a temperature rise from 31.6 to 38.1 °C. The temperature rise and fall curves are shown in Fig. 2j and the time constant τs = 287.5 s (Fig. 2k) was fitted by the data of the cooling stage. The photothermal conversion efficiency of Cu3(PO4)2 was 34.6%, which was calculated according to eqn (S1)–(S5) (ESI†). Five laser switching cycle experiments were carried out to explore the photothermal stability of Cu3(PO4)2 in aqueous solution. The temperature of the solution was monitored using a digital thermometer and recorded every 20 s. Fig. 2l shows that the solution could rise to ∼60 °C each time after laser irradiation for five cycles, which indicates the stability of the Cu3(PO4)2 and suggests the possibility of long-term cyclic application. And the SEM image in Fig. S4 (ESI†) shows that the size and morphology of Cu3(PO4)2 remained substantially unchanged after the photothermal cycling experiments, which further indicates the satisfactory photostability of the prepared Cu3(PO4)2.

Effects of PEGDA coating on the cytotoxicity and peroxidase-like properties of Cu3(PO4)2
The cytotoxicities of Cu3(PO4)2@PEGDA and Cu3(PO4)2 were evaluated by MTT assays and the data is displayed in Fig. 3a. Within the concentration range of 25–100 μg mL−1, Cu3(PO4)2@PEGDA demonstrated a low toxicity to HeLa cells with a cell viability exceeding 50%. It is worth noting that the toxicity of Cu3(PO4)2@PEGDA was much lower than that of Cu3(PO4)2. Fig. S5 (ESI†) shows the images of trypan blue-stained HUVEC cells which received the same treatment as HeLa cells. In contrast to the cancer cells, very few HUVEC cells in the Cu3(PO4)2@PEGDA + H2O2 + laser group were positively stained by trypan blue, indicating the minimal side effects of the Cu3(PO4)2@PEGDA-mediated anti-tumor protocol on non-cancerous cells. Although the principle of the MTT assay is based only on the NADPH enzyme activity rather than the actual viability of cells, there is no doubt that the biocompatibility of Cu3(PO4)2@PEGDA was superior to that of the uncoated Cu3(PO4)2. The improved biocompatibility can be attributed to the PEGDA coating, which effectively inhibited the release of Cu ions from the degradable Cu3(PO4)2. Fig. 3b shows the Cu ion release profiles of Cu3(PO4)2 and Cu3(PO4)2@PEGDA in DMEM medium (pH = 7.8). The results indicated that the Cu concentration in the dialysis fluid of Cu3(PO4)2@PEGDA was much lower than that measured for Cu3(PO4)2 after the samples were soaked in the medium for 2–48 h. The SEM images (Fig. 3c) captured for the two samples which had been immersed in the DMEM medium for 24 h provide more evidence. As is shown, the morphology of Cu3(PO4)2 was quite different from its original spherical morphology, whereas Cu3(PO4)2@PEGDA still remained sphere-like, although some of the nanospheres became smaller and the surface became rough. Taking together the results and the well-known toxicity of copper ions,39,40 it is reasonable to conclude that the PEGDA coating effectively slowed down the degradation of Cu3(PO4)2, thus decreasing the cytotoxicity resulting from the release of a burst of Cu ions. We further investigated the degradation of Cu3(PO4)2 and Cu3(PO4)2@PEGDA in the acidic environment of tumors using a citric acid–Na2HPO4 buffer (pH 5.6) as the medium. The results in Fig. S6 (ESI†) indicate that the PEGDA coating was also effective in suppressing the rapid degradation of Cu3(PO4)2 in the acidic environment.

In addition, the nanospheres still showed peroxidase-like activities after PEGDA coating (Fig. 3d). The influence of pH and temperature on the enzyme mimetic properties of Cu3(PO4)2@PEGDA were investigated. The data shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†) and Fig. 3e and f demonstrate that, with the other conditions kept constant, the UV-vis NIR absorption at 650 nm of TMB–H2O2–Cu3(PO4)2@PEGDA increased the most rapidly and reached the highest level at pH 3.2 or 60 °C, which is consistent with the deepest blue color shown in the insets of Fig. S7 (ESI†) and Fig. 3e and f. The wide response range to pH and temperature provide a wider scope of applications for the Cu3(PO4)2@PEGDA nanozyme in comparison to HRP (pH > 5, T < 40 °C).41–43 The more acidic microenvironment of tumor cells may be more appropriate for ROS production and accumulation (Fig. 3e). According to the results in Fig. 3f, which indicate that the nanospheres are more reactive at higher temperatures, we investigated the chromogenic reaction of TMB–H2O2–Cu3(PO4)2@PEGDA exposed to an 808 nm laser. As shown in Fig. S8 (ESI†), the absorbance at 650 nm and the color change were evidently accelerated by the laser irradiation, which could be ascribed to the photothermal effects of Cu3(PO4)2 and suggests the advantages of Cu3(PO4)2 over ordinary nanozymes. This phenomenon also inspired us to develop a combined therapy of PTT and OST to achieve amplified anti-tumor effects.
GSH depletion by Cu3(PO4)2@PEGDA

Fig. 3g and h illustrate the depletion of GSH by Cu3(PO4)2@PEGDA. GSH is the most abundant antioxidant in cells. It acts as a scavenger of ROS to maintain the cellular redox status, which, in turn, compromises the killing effects of ROS on cancer cells subjected to OST. What's more, the concentration of GSH in tumor cells is approximately 2–4 fold higher than that in normal cells.21 Therefore, the depletion of GSH would be an effective way to enhance the killing efficiency of OST. For this purpose, we investigated the interaction between GSH and our Cu3(PO4)2@PEGDA nanozyme. We were pleased to find out that the Cu3(PO4)2@PEGDA nanozyme could effectively consume GSH in a mass-dependent way (Fig. 3g). A DTNB probe was used to quantify the depletion rate of GSH.44 The results in Fig. 3h demonstrate that 23.6–98.4% GSH (total 0.2 mmol) was consumed by 2–20 μg Cu3(PO4)2@PEGDA within 1 h. Moreover, the time-scan mode assay indicated that 20 μg Cu3(PO4)2@PEGDA rapidly consumed 82.5% GSH within only 10 min (Fig. S9, ESI†). From the data in Fig. S10 (ESI†), the consumption rate of GSH by Cu3(PO4)2 was calculated to be 85.9%, which was slightly higher than that of Cu3(PO4)2@PEGDA and indicates that PEGDA coating did not greatly influence the GSH depleting capability of Cu3(PO4)2.
The chromogenic reaction of the TMB–H2O2–Cu3(PO4)2@PEGDA reaction system was also used to investigate the influence of GSH on the ROS level of this system, which provided further evidence of GSH-depletion by the nanozyme. As shown in Fig. S11 (ESI†), the characteristic absorption band of oxidized TMB (λ = 650 nm) recorded for the TMB + Cu3(PO4)2@PEGDA + H2O2 system was greatly enhanced by the addition of GSH. Accordingly, the blue color of the oxidized TMB was more apparent, as shown in the inset of Fig. S11 (ESI†), suggesting a higher ROS level caused by the introduction of GSH. We attributed the elevation of the ROS level to Cu+, which is more active than Cu2+ to catalyze toxic ˙OH generation from H2O2, as a product of GSH depletion. Therefore, further amplified anti-tumor effects could be anticipated for the Cu3(PO4)2@PEGDA nanozyme in light of the GSH depletion coupled with the up-regulated ˙OH level and photothermal effects.

In vitro anti-tumor efficiency
Based on the above results, we investigated the in vitro anti-tumor efficacy of Cu3(PO4)2@PEGDA-mediated protocol using the HeLa cell line as a cancer cell model. The cells were randomly divided into 7 groups: control, Cu3(PO4)2@PEGDA, H2O2, laser, Cu3(PO4)2@PEGDA + H2O2, Cu3(PO4)2@PEGDA + laser and Cu3(PO4)2@PEGDA + H2O2 + laser. As shown in Fig. 3i, the cell survival rate of the H2O2 and laser groups, evaluated by MTT assays, were 88.7% and 85.6%, respectively. After incubation with Cu3(PO4)2@PEGDA (25 μg mL−1) for 2 h, 86.4% HeLa cells survived, but the survival rate was reduced to 53.7% and 49.4% after further exposure to H2O2 (the Cu3(PO4)2@PEGDA + H2O2 group) and 808 nm laser irradiation (the Cu3(PO4)2@PEGDA + laser group), respectively. An even lower cell viability of 43.4% was obtained for the cells in the Cu3(PO4)2@PEGDA + H2O2 + laser group, which indicates the amplified therapeutic effects of the combined PTT–OST on the cancer cells. In order to elucidate the cell death mechanism mediated by Cu3(PO4)2@PEGDA, the intracellular ROS level and mitochondria membrane potential (MMP) were evaluated by ROS- and MMP-sensitive fluorescent probes, respectively. Usually, damage to mitochondria is effective evidence of cell apoptosis caused by ROS. In this study, we used Rh123 to measure the MMP of the HeLa cells. Fig. 4a–d show that the bright fluorescence intensity and granularity, indicative of normal mitochondria, were found in the control and Cu3(PO4)2@PEGDA groups, but hardly in the H2O2 and Cu3(PO4)2@PEGDA + H2O2 + laser groups, which indicated that mitochondrial damage occurred in the latter two groups. Interestingly, the images of the DCFH-DA-stained cells had an appearance which was contrary to that of the Rh123-stained cells, i.e., the lower the MMP, the higher the ROS level. This suggests the correlation between the ROS level and mitochondria injury, as mentioned above. The amplified therapeutic effects of combined PTT-OST were identified by the even higher intracellular ROS level as well as the even lower MMP observed for the Cu3(PO4)2@PEGDA + H2O2 + laser group (Fig. 4e–h).

For more information about the cell death pathway, a Hoechst 33342/PI co-staining protocol, which can distinguish normal, apoptotic, and dead cell populations by fluorescence microscopy, was performed on the HeLa cells. Hoechst 33342 and PI are both fluorescent dyes which emit blue and red fluorescence, respectively, when bound to DNA. The simultaneous use of Hoechst 33342 and PI can distinguish apoptotic from necrotic cells since PI is only permeable in necrotic cells. Moreover, Hoechst 33342 stains the condensed chromatin in apoptotic cells more brightly than normal chromatin. In the staining patterns of this assay (Fig. 4i–p), the cell nuclei in the Cu3(PO4)2@PEGDA group emitted uniform blue fluorescence which was comparable to that of the control group, indicating the minimal side effects of the nanozyme itself. Cell nuclei emitting dazzling blue light were occasionally observed in the H2O2 group, suggesting initial apoptosis caused by the H2O2 treatment, which is in accordance with the MMP decrease observed in the Rh123 staining images. For the Cu3(PO4)2@PEGDA + H2O2 + laser group, it was rather remarkable that the fluorescence of Hoechst 33342 and PI were both abnormally emitted from the cytoplasm rather than the nuclei where the chromatin should reside.
In order to understand this exceptional phenomenon, we characterized the changes in the subcellular microstructures exposed to Cu3(PO4)2@PEGDA + H2O2 + laser by TEM, which is the most reliable method to determine the cell death mode and is considered to be the gold standard to identify the cell death mechanism.45 Herein, necrotic cells, featured by broken cell membranes, are clearly displayed in the TEM image of the Cu3(PO4)2@PEGDA + H2O2 + laser group (Fig. 5a). Furthermore, not only were the cell membranes severely damaged, but also the nuclear membranes, accompanied by the dissipation of the nuclei content (denoted by the red arrows in Fig. 5a), which resulted in a chromatin influx into the cell plasma as an inevitable consequence. That is why the fluorescence of Hoechst 33342 and PI were both abnormally emitted from the cell plasma rather than from the nuclei. In sharp contrast, intact cells with normal morphology were captured for the cells in the Cu3(PO4)2@PEGDA + laser and Cu3(PO4)2@PEGDA + H2O2 groups, which definitely identifies the significantly amplified killing efficiency of the combined PTT-OST protocol compared to the PTT/OST-only protocols. It was puzzling that the cancer cell killing rate of the Cu3(PO4)2@PEGDA + H2O2 + laser group measured by MTT assay was only 56.7% (Fig. 3i), much lower than the value of ∼100% calculated by counting the number of necrotic cells in the Hoechst 33342/PI image (Fig. 4i–p). In order to solve this puzzle, trypan blue (TB) staining was performed (Fig. 4b). TB is a stain used to quantify live cells by detecting the cell membrane integrity, based on the principle that TB can only penetrate broken or porous cell membranes and cannot pass through the cell membranes of live cells. Consequently, the ratio of cells that can be positively labeled by TB is the actual death rate of the cells. However, the cell viability measured by MTT assays is calculated from the absorption of formazan reduced from MTT. If the conversion from MTT to formazan in live cells is disturbed by some redox agents, or the absorption of formazan is changed owing to metallic chelating, the MTT assay will give false results. It has been reported that Cu2+ can chelate with formazan and form a compound which has stronger absorption than formazan at 570 nm.46 In this work, Cu2+ released from the nanozyme is very likely to act as a metal-chelating agent and finally lead to an artificially high cell viability value from the MTT assay. As the severe damage caused by the Cu3(PO4)2@PEGDA + H2O2 + laser treatment could be identified from the subcellular structure observations, we can draw a conclusion that in this study the therapeutic effects evaluated by the TB staining method were more reliable than that from the MTT assay.
 Fig. 5  Sectional TEM images (a) and trypan blue staining images (b) of HeLa cells after the cells were exposed to different treatments for 12 h. In (a), the nuclei are denoted Nu and the red arrows indicate the ruptured cell membranes and nuclear membranes. The scale bars in (a) and (b) represent 2 μm and 100 μm, respectively. 
Notably, condensed chromatin, that presents as black blocks in the cell nuclei, is observed in the TEM image of the HeLa cells in the H2O2 group but not in that of the control group. Nuclear chromatin condensation is a feature associated with apoptotic cells. During apoptosis, the chromatin is digested and condenses along the nuclear membrane. The apoptosis symptoms observed for the H2O2 group signifies early apoptosis, which is in good agreement with the results of the MMP and ROS level measurements. All in all, the in vitro therapeutic effects of the Cu3(PO4)2@PEGDA nanozyme as an anti-tumor agent could be identified.

In vivo biosafety of the Cu3(PO4)2@PEGDA nanozyme
We evaluated the biocompatibility of the Cu3(PO4)2@PEGDA nanozyme via hemolysis and hematological analysis in which Cu3(PO4)2@PEGDA nanozymes were co-incubated with rat RBCs at 37 °C. The results shown in the inset of Fig. 6a demonstrate that Cu3(PO4)2@PEGDA caused an extremely low hemolysis rate of RBCs even at a high concentration of 1000 μg mL−1. The optical absorbance (λ = 570 nm) of the supernatant recorded for the Cu3(PO4)2@PEGDA group was not much different from that of the PBS group (Fig. 6a), which further reveals the excellent blood biocompatibility of Cu3(PO4)2@PEGDA. Then, we used ICR female mice as an animal model to evaluate the in vivo acute and chronic toxicities of Cu3(PO4)2@PEGDA. A Cu3(PO4)2@PEGDA aqueous suspension was injected into mice through the tail vein once a day for 3 days. Then, the blood of the mice was taken for hematological analysis by measuring the indices of white blood cells (WBCs), RBCs, hemoglobin (HGB), hematocrit (HCT), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), MCH concentration (MCHC) and platelets (PLT). Fig. S12 (ESI†) indicates that all of the indices measured for the Cu3(PO4)2@PEGDA group were within the normal range. This means that Cu3(PO4)2@PEGDA did not damage the blood cells or cause significant inflammation in the body, further suggesting the excellent biocompatibility of the Cu3(PO4)2@PEGDA nanozyme.

In vivo anti-tumor effects of the Cu3(PO4)2@PEGDA nanozyme
Encouraged by the satisfactory PTT–OST effect in vitro, we further evaluated the synergistic therapeutic effects of the Cu3(PO4)2@PEGDA nanozyme in vivo. 4T1 tumor-bearing female Balb/c nude mice were randomly separated into 4 groups: PBS, H2O2, Cu3(PO4)2@PEGDA and Cu3(PO4)2@PEGDA + H2O2 + laser. The therapeutic regimen was performed in the first three days. Tumor volume and body weight were monitored every day. As shown in Fig. 6b and c, the tumor growth curve recorded for the H2O2 group was very similar to that of the PBS group, indicating that the H2O2 injection at a dosage of 5 mM (100 μL) did not significantly affect the growth of the tumors. Remarkably, the tumor growth of the mice in the Cu3(PO4)2@PEGDA + H2O2 + laser group was significantly suppressed, with a tumor-growth inhibition rate (TGI) of 79.3% at the 20th day of the anti-tumor treatment (Fig. 6c). Notably, the TGI of the Cu3(PO4)2@PEGDA-only treatment also exhibited anti-tumor effects, with a TGI value of 42.5%. This might be due to the presence of endogenous H2O2 in the tumors which generated ˙OH after the Cu3(PO4)2@PEGDA was injected into the tumors.
The results of in vivo experiment further demonstrate the minimal side effects caused by the anti-tumor protocol. Fig. S13 (ESI†) shows the H&E staining images of normal tissues sectioned from the main organs of the mice. Compared to the control group, the main organs, including the heart, liver, spleen, lung and kidney of the treated mice, exhibited no obvious injury. The weight of the treated mice also maintained a steady increase during the treatment period (Fig. 6d), which further illustrates the minimal side effects of the Cu3(PO4)2@PEGDA-mediated anti-tumor protocol on normal tissues. The reason may be attributed to the suppressed peroxidase-like activities of Cu3(PO4)2 in the neutral environment of normal tissues. As mentioned above, Cu3(PO4)2 exhibits pH responsive peroxidase-like activities, which makes it possible to realize tumor-responsive killing effects.
H&E staining was subsequently performed to further evaluate the therapeutic effects and the results in Fig. 6e demonstrate more obvious necrosis and karyolysis in the Cu3(PO4)2@PEGDA + H2O2 + laser group than in the Cu3(PO4)2@PEGDA group, while no significant cell necrosis was observed in the PBS group or the H2O2 group. All of these results prove the excellent anti-cancer performance of the Cu3(PO4)2@PEGDA nanozyme, which makes efficient and safe tumor elimination possible.
Conclusions
In conclusion, we have successfully synthesized a novel degradable Cu3(PO4)2@PEGDA nanozyme which can amplify the OST effects on cancers, owing to its combined peroxidase-like, GSH depleting and photothermal functions. We have also developed a smart surface coating strategy of peroxidase-like nanoparticles to improve their biocompatibility. A fine core–shell structure was obtained since the polymerization of the shell was catalyzed by the Cu3(PO4)2 cores themselves. The PEGDA shell significantly slowed down the degradation of the Cu3(PO4)2 cores, thus inhibiting the release of copper ions and remarkably reducing the cytotoxicity of the nanozyme without compromising its enzyme-like, GSH depleting and photothermal properties. Taking into account the excellent anticancer effects of the Cu3(PO4)2@PEGDA nanozyme, we regard this work to be meaningful in developing novel tumor therapy agents, surface modification methods aiming at improving biocompatibility and the well-controlled degradability of inorganic nanoparticles.

Preparation of the Cu3(PO4)2 nanozyme
The method to fabricate the Cu3(PO4)2 nanozyme was similar to the procedure to prepare Cu3(PO4)2 nanoparticles (NP) that has been reported by Chen et al.47 First, H2NCONH2 (6.0 g) and SDS (0.05 g) were dissolved in deionized (DI) water (84 mL). Then, CuSO4·5H2O (0.125 g) and H3PO4 (30%, 0.163 g) aqueous solution (8 mL) were added into the previous solution in order. Next, the mixed solution was put into a 150 mL Teflon-lined hydrothermal synthesis autoclave reactor at 80 °C for 2 h. The obtained products were collected by centrifugation (8000 rpm for 5 min) and washed thoroughly with DI water and ethanol six times and dried at 60 °C.
Preparation of the Cu3(PO4)2@PEGDA nanozyme
Firstly, the prepared Cu3(PO4)2 (10 mg) and PEG400DA monomer (150 mg) were stirred in DI water (10 mL) for 12 h and centrifuged to obtain the precipitate. Then, HCl solution (10 mL) with pH = 4 was added to the precipitate and irradiated with an 808 nm laser. When the temperature reached ∼60 °C, H2O2 (80 μL, 1.0 M) was added into the solution to initiate the polymerization of the monomers, and the reaction was kept at 60 °C for 1 h. Finally, the obtained products were collected by centrifugation (8000 rpm) for 5 min and washed thoroughly with DI water and ethanol four times and dried at 60 °C.
Composition and morphology characterizations of the Cu3(PO4)2 and Cu3(PO4)2@PEGDA nanozymes
The morphologies of the products were examined by a scanning electron microscope (SEM; JEOL, JSM-6700F, Japan) and a transmission electron microscope (TEM; JEOL, JEM-1200EX, Japan). XRD patterns of the Cu3(PO4)2 NPs were obtained by an X-ray powder diffractometer (XRD; Rigaku, D/max-2500, Japan) using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å). The size distribution was measured by dynamic light scattering (DLS; Zetasizer Nano-ZS, Malvern, England). Elemental analysis of the Cu3(PO4)2 NPs was performed with a X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Thermo SCALAB 250XI, USA). The functional groups of the samples were analyzed using a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FT-IR, Bruker, VERTEX-70, Germany). The optical absorption was detected using a UV-vis NIR spectrophotometer (Cary5000, USA). The concentration of the copper element was measured by an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES; SPECTRO ARCOS, Germany).
Peroxidase activities of the Cu3(PO4)2 and Cu3(PO4)2@PEGDA nanozymes
The peroxidase-like activities of Cu3(PO4)2 and Cu3(PO4)2@PEGDA were evaluated by the chromogenic reaction of TMB. Typically, TMB (0.5 mM) and H2O2 (0.5 mM) were mixed with Cu3(PO4)2 (20 μg mL−1) in a citrate acid–Na2HPO4 buffer solution (pH 2.2–8.0) or a KH2PO4–NaOH buffer solution (pH 5.8–8.0) with a total volume of 2.5 mL and incubated for 4 h at 4–70 °C. The absorbances at 650 nm were then detected by a UV-vis NIR spectrophotometer.
Michaelis–Menten kinetic analysis was performed at room temperature for the TMB–H2O2–Cu3(PO4)2 reaction system with a total volume of 2.5 mL. The parameters to evaluate the affinity of Cu3(PO4)2 for TMB were obtained with various TMB concentrations (0.1–0.55 mM) but a constant H2O2 concentration (100 mM). A similar procedure was carried out to evaluate the affinity of Cu3(PO4)2 for H2O2, in which the concentration of H2O2 varied from 10 to 100 mM but the TMB concentration was kept at 0.5 mM. The 650 nm absorption peak changes with temporal variation were detected by a UV-vis NIR spectrophotometer. The kinetic parameters were calculated by fitting the absorbance data to the Michaelis–Menten eqn (2).
The peroxidase-like activities were also detected by the chemiluminescence reaction of luminol. In a typical procedure, luminol (50 μL, 0.01 M) was dispersed in a Na2CO3–NaHCO3 buffer solution (2 mL, 0.1 M). Then, H2O2 (50 μL, 25 mM) and Cu3(PO4)2 (50 μL, 0.2 mg mL−1) were added and the fluorescence emission spectra were recorded every 15 seconds. DI water was used as the control instead of Cu3(PO4)2 or H2O2, and the data were recorded every 1 min.
Photothermal properties of the Cu3(PO4)2 nanozyme
Cu3(PO4)2 was dispersed in water to obtain aqueous suspension samples with concentrations of 1.25–7.5 mg mL−1. Then the samples were transferred to a 5 mL quartz cuvette and irradiated by an 808 nm NIR laser with a power density of 0.5–2.0 W cm−2. The probe of an online type thermocouple thermometer (UT325, Uni-Trend Technology Co., Ltd, China) with an accuracy of ±0.1 °C was inserted into the samples perpendicular to the laser path. The temperature was recorded by the thermometer every 10 s for 10 min. During the whole measurement process, the probe was located on the right corner of the quartz cuvette while the laser spot was focused on the left corner with a distance of about 0.9 cm to the probe to avoid the direct irradiation of the probe by the laser.
A sample with a volume of 1 mL and a concentration of 3.75 mg mL−1 was used to investigate the photothermal conversion efficiency of Cu3(PO4)2, which was irradiated by the 808 nm NIR laser (2.5 W cm−2) for 740 s and then naturally cooled to room temperature without NIR laser irradiation. The temperature was recorded every 30 s by the thermometer and the photothermal conversion efficiency was calculated by eqn (S1)–(S5) (ESI†).48 This cycle was repeated five times using the sample with a concentration of 2 mg mL−1 to investigate the photostability of the Cu3(PO4)2 nanozyme.
Degradation of the Cu3(PO4)2 and Cu3(PO4)2@PEGDA nanozymes
To evaluate the degradation of the nanozymes in normal tissues, Cu3(PO4)2 and Cu3(PO4)2@PEGDA (2.5 mg) were soaked in DMEM medium (5 mL, pH = 7.8) for 2–48 h and then centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 5 min to obtain the supernatant samples. The release profiles of Cu ions from the nanozymes were plotted by measuring the Cu content of the supernatant samples using ICP-OES.
A citrate acid–Na2HPO4 buffer solution with a pH of 5.6 was used to replace the DMEM medium in order to investigate the degradation of Cu3(PO4)2 and Cu3(PO4)2@PEGDA in the slightly acidic environment of tumors. Typically, Cu3(PO4)2 and Cu3(PO4)2@PEGDA aqueous suspensions (900 μL, 0.2 mg mL−1) were placed in a dialysis membrane bag (cutoff kDa = 500) and then sunk into a citrate acid–Na2HPO4 buffer solution (9.1 mL). After a predetermined period, the buffer solution (1 mL) was drawn out from the release system for the analysis of the Cu content by ICP-OES, and fresh buffer solution (1 mL) was added into the release system. The release profiles of Cu ions from the nanozymes were also plotted. The cumulative released Cu ions (c) were calculated according to eqn (3): (3)where Ct is the concentration of Cu ions measured by ICP-OES, Vt represents the volume of the buffer solution drawn out from the release system each time and Vtotal is the total volume of the release system. In the present study, Vt is 1 mL and Vtotal is 10 mL.
Cell culture
A human cervical carcinoma cell line (HeLa), human umbilical vein endothelial cell line (HUVEC) and a murine mammary carcinoma cell line (4T1) were obtained from the Shanghai Gaining Biotechnology Co. Ltd (China). HeLa cells were cultured in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS, streptomycin (1%) and LG (1%), and HUVEC and 4T1 cells were cultured in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS and streptomycin (1%) at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2.
Cytotoxicity of the Cu3(PO4)2 and Cu3(PO4)2@PEGDA nanozyme
MTT viability assays, a colorimetric measure of mitochondrial activity, were used to assess the biocompatibility of the nanozymes, which were first sterilized and then dispersed in DMEM culture medium with a concentration of 25–100 μg mL−1. HeLa cells were cultured in a 96-well plate (Costar, approximately 4 × 103 cells per well) with DMEM medium containing 10% FBS and the nanozymes for 24 h. Then, MTT solution (20 μL, 5 mg mL−1 in phosphate buffer solution, pH 7.4) was added to each well and incubated for 4 h at 37 °C. After removing the medium, intracellular formazan crystals were extracted into 150 μL of DMSO and quantified by measuring the absorbance of the cell lysate at 490 nm. Cell viability was expressed as a percentage of the control. All results are the average ± SD of six samples.
GSH depletion of the Cu3(PO4)2@PEGDA nanozyme
GSH depletion by Cu3(PO4)2@PEGDA was quantified using DTNB as a probe. The as-obtained Cu3(PO4)2@PEGDA nanozyme was dispersed in water to prepare samples with concentrations from 0–10 μg mL−1. Afterwards, the samples were incubated with GSH aqueous solution (200 μL, 1 mM) at room temperature in a KH2PO4–NaOH buffer solution (1.6 mL, pH = 7.4) for 1 h. Then, DTNB (dissolved in DMSO, 200 μL, 1 mM) was added and the absorbance of the reaction system at 412 nm was recorded by a UV-vis NIR spectrophotometer two minutes later. The GSH consumption rate was quantified according to the ratio of the absorbance increase to the absorbance without Cu3(PO4)2.
In the time-scan mode assay, Cu3(PO4)2@PEGDA (200 μL, 100 μg mL−1), GSH (200 μL, 0.1 mM), TMB (50 μL, 25 mM) and H2O2 (50 μL, 25 mM) were dissolved in HCl solution (1.6 mL, pH = 3). As a control, GSH was replaced by DI water. The absorbance was measured at 650 nm after 1.5 h.

In vitro anti-tumor therapy mediated by the Cu3(PO4)2@PEGDA nanozyme
HeLa cells and HUVEC cells were seeded in a 96-well plate (∼4 × 103 cells per well) and randomly divided into 7 groups: control, Cu3(PO4)2@PEGDA, laser, H2O2, Cu3(PO4)2@PEGDA + laser, Cu3(PO4)2@PEGDA + H2O2 and Cu3(PO4)2@PEGDA + H2O2 + laser. Cu3(PO4)2@PEGDA, diluted using culture medium (100 μL per well, 25 μg mL−1), was added into the wells of the Cu3(PO4)2@PEGDA, Cu3(PO4)2@PEGDA + laser and Cu3(PO4)2@PEGDA + H2O2 groups and kept for 2 h. Then, H2O2 (diluted in PBS, 100 μL per well, 0.3 mM) was added to the H2O2- and Cu3(PO4)2@PEGDA + H2O2 groups of cells for further incubation for 4 h. After that, the culture medium was removed and the laser and Cu3(PO4)2@PEGDA + laser groups of cells were continuously irradiated by an 808 nm laser (0.5 W cm−2) for 5 min. Finally, fresh culture medium was added and the cells were incubated for another 12 h as the post-time. The in vitro anti-tumor effects were evaluated by the MTT method.
TB staining, which reflects the cell membrane damage, was carried out. Typically, TB (20 μL per well, 1 mg mL−1) was incubated with the HeLa cells and HUVEC cells for 10 minutes in the incubator after the in vitro anti-tumor protocol described above. Then, the cells were rinsed with PBS three times and imaged by an inverted microscope (Nikon, Eclipse TE2000S, Japan).
The oxidant-sensitive fluorescent probe DCFH-DA was used to detect the intracellular ROS levels. Briefly, cells were incubated with DCFH-DA (25 μM, 20 μL per well) in serum-free DMEM for 30 min at 37 °C in the dark. The fluorescence intensity of DCFH-DA was detected with an inverted fluorescence microscope (Nikon, Eclipse TE2000S, Japan) at excitation and emission wavelengths of 480 nm and 525 nm, respectively.
Changes in mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) were assessed using the fluorescent probe Rh123. Typically, the cells were incubated with Rh123 solution (20 μM, 20 μL per well) for 30 min in the incubator and then rinsed with PBS several times before fluorescence imaging (λEX = 345 nm).
Hoechst 33342/PI assays were used to detect the DNA/RNA damage. After the anti-tumor protocol was finished, Hoechst 33342 (50 μg mL−1, 15 μL per well) and PI (25 μg mL−1, 15 μL per well) were both added into the wells and incubated with the cells together for 30 min in the incubator. Then, the cells were washed with PBS 3 times and fluorescence images were captured by an inverted fluorescence microscope.
Cell structure investigations by TEM
The cell death pathway was further determined by cell ultrastructural analysis using TEM. In short, HeLa cells were seeded in 75 cm2 culture bottles (Costar) and exposed to H2O2 (0.3 mM, 20 mL, 4 h), Cu3(PO4)2@PEGDA (25 μg mL−1, 20 mL, 2 h) and Cu3(PO4)2@PEGDA + laser (0.5 W cm−2, 5 min) treatments. Then, the fresh culture medium was replaced and the cells were cultured for another 12 h in the incubator. After that, the cells were washed with PBS, fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde at 4 °C for 3 h and then scraped and collected by centrifugation to obtain cell clusters. After being stained with uranyl acetate solution, dehydrated by a series of acetone treatments and embedded in epoxy resin, ultrathin sections of the cells were obtained by an ultramicrotome and imaged by a TEM (JEOL, JEM-1200EX, Japan, 80 kV).
Systematic toxicity in vivo
Healthy, female Balb/c mice (5–7 weeks old, 14–18 g) were obtained from the Beijing Vital River Laboratory Animal Technology Co. Ltd (China). In the hemolysis test, red blood cells (RBCs) were isolated from CD rat whole blood cells by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 5 min and washing three times with PBS. Diluted suspensions of RBCs (2% in PBS) were mixed (1:1, v/v) with different concentrations of Cu3(PO4)2@PEGDA. PBS and 0.1% Triton X-100 were used as the negative and positive controls, respectively. The mixed samples were incubated for 3 h at 37 °C. After centrifugation, the supernatant was photographed and placed in a 96-well plate (100 μL) and then the absorbances at 570 nm were detected by a microplate reader (Thermo Scientific Company, USA).
For hematology analysis, the mice were divided into two groups (n = 5 per group): (1) the PBS group (control), (2) the Cu3(PO4)2@PEGDA group. 100 μL of PBS or Cu3(PO4)2@PEGDA (22 mg kg−1) was infused via tail vein injection. Blood samples were collected by retroorbital bleed from the eye on the 1st and 10th days post-injection. Subsequently, the samples (100 μL) were mixed with anticoagulant (EDTA-3 K, 30 mg mL−1, 20 μL), and hematological parameters were measured by an auto hematology analyzer (Mindray, 348 BC-2800Vet).
Establishment of tumor models
For the establishment of the tumor models, 106 4T1 murine breast cancer cells suspended in PBS (100 μL) were subcutaneously injected into each mouse at the right flank. After 7 days of feeding, the mice were used for the in vivo tumor inhibition experiments once the tumour volume reached approximately 150–200 mm3.

In vivo antitumor activity of the Cu3(PO4)2@PEGDA nanozyme
To evaluate the therapeutic effects of Cu3(PO4)2@PEGDA in vivo, the tumor-bearing mice were randomly divided into 4 groups: PBS, H2O2, Cu3(PO4)2@PEGDA and Cu3(PO4)2@PEGDA + H2O2 + laser. The mice were intratumorally injected with PBS (100 μL), Cu3(PO4)2@PEGDA (350 μg mL−1, 100 μL) or H2O2 (5 mM, 100 μL). After 10 min, the tumor sites of the mice in the Cu3(PO4)2@PEGDA + H2O2 + laser group were exposed to an 808 nm laser (0.8 W cm−2, 10 min) within the first 3 days. The changes in the tumor volumes and body weights of the mice were continuously monitored for 20 days. The tumor volume (V) was defined as: V = LW2/2, where L and W are defined as the tumor length and width, respectively. The relative tumor volume (RTV) was equal to Vi/V0, where Vi and V0 represent the tumor volume (on the measuring day) and tumor volume (on day 0), respectively. The mice were sacrificed to harvest the major organs (heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney and tumor) after 20 days. Then, hematoxylin–eosin (H&E) staining was conducted for histopathological observation.
Statistical analysis
Quantitative data were expressed as mean ± s.d. Statistical comparisons were conducted using Student's two tailed t test.
