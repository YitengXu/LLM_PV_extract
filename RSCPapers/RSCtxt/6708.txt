1. Introduction
As the world continues to consume non-renewable fossil fuels, more and more attention is being turned to alternative renewable energy sources, such as solar power. Dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), with their novel concept based on the photosynthesis process, have seen an explosive growth in research in recent years largely due to their environmentally-friendly production process, low cost fabrication and relatively high efficiency.1–11 There are a number of factors that influence the improvement of DSSCs.12–16 One of the main factors is the mismatch that exists between the absorption spectrum of the sensitizer and the solar irradiation spectrum. Therefore, panchromatic sensitizers (400 nm–1200 nm) are highly desired. A variety of new dyes, co-sensitizers with broad absorption spectra and high molar extinction coefficients, have been developed to broaden the light absorption of DSSCs.17–21 However, these dyes suffer from some major drawbacks such as poor electron injection efficiency, serious charge recombination, and dye aggregation that limit their use in DSSCs. Thus, it is important to improve the functionality of the photoelectrode material to enhance light harvesting. Many effective ways are used to enhance the light harvesting capability of the dyes, such as using a larger surface area or introducing a scattering layer.22–25 Nevertheless, the mismatch existing between the absorption spectra of the sensitizers and the solar irradiation spectrum is still problematic.
Upconversion (UC) materials can absorb infrared photons and induce anti-stokes emissions in the visible region that can be reutilized by most current sensitizers to produce more electrons. Efficient UC particles as potential spectrum modifiers have been successfully applied in DSSCs. For example, Li et al. enhanced the photoelectric conversion efficiency of DSSCs by incorporating the dual-mode luminescent NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+.26 Wu et al. introduced Y0.78Yb0.20Er0.02F3 into a TiO2 photoelectrode and improved the photovoltaic performance by 35%.27 Yuan et al. applied colloidal upconversion nanocrystals as an energy relay material to increase the light absorption capability of the solar cells and improved the overall photocurrent.28 Upconverter doped TiO2 hollow shells and core–shell structured upconversion nanoparticles were introduced into the DSSC photoelectrode as a light-scattering and upconverting layer to yield improved conversion efficiencies.29,30 All of these above mentioned works improved the TiO2-based DSSCs conversion efficiency by taking advantage of the luminescence-mediated energy transfer (LET) processes in UC particles.
Multi-component heterostructures containing two or more nanocomponents are a promising class of materials. Due to a special interaction among these multiple components, nanoheterostructure systems can offer some amazing advantages over single component systems. Besides their multi-functional character, they might also improve existing or spark some new chemical or electronic properties.31–37 For example, Yan et al. demonstrated the possibility of electron transfer from upconversion nanoparticles (UCNP) to quantum dots (QD) via the heterostructure interfaces in UCNP/QD nanoheterostructures.32,38 Similarly, it was possible to transfer electrons from UCNP to the conduction band of TiO2via shared interfaces.39 However, studies of electron-mediated energy transfer (EET) from upconverting lanthanide materials are still rare, and insufficient effort has been put into analyzing the photogenerated charge transfer properties of upconversion nanoheterostructures.
Based on the above preconceptions, we designed new upconversion YbF3-Ho/TiO2 (UC/TiO2) nanoheterostructures and explored their use as an efficient photoelectrode material to yield dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) with improved performance. TiO2 is the best semiconducting photoelectrode material with its chemical stability, strong charge separation and long lifetime of excited electrons.40 In this study, we analyzed the photogenerated charge transfer properties of the UC/TiO2 nanoheterostructures, and the interfacial dynamics of the charge transfer and recombination processes in the DSSCs. It was found that combining the upconversion function of YbF3-Ho and the semiconductive merits of TiO2 further improved the properties of the UC/TiO2 nanoheterostructures. When integrating the UC/TiO2 nanoheterostructures into DSSCs an overall energy conversion efficiency of 8.0% was achieved. There was a 23% enhancement in the overall conversion efficiency and a 19% improvement in the photocurrent compared to the pristine devices.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Synthesis of YbF3-Ho
Lanthanide oxides (3.3 mmol Yb2O3, 0.065 mmol Ho2O3) were dissolved using HNO3 at an elevated temperature. The excess HNO3 was evaporated and then 3 mL deionized water was added to make a solution for future use. 0.017 mol NH4HF2 was dissolved in 20 mL distilled water, then the prepared lanthanide nitrate solution was added slowly while stirring. After that, HF (40%) was used to adjust the pH value to around 4–5, the solution was then kept stirring for 1 h at room temperature, transferred into a polytetrafluoroethylene autoclave (50 mL capacity) and maintained at 180 °C for 18 hours. After natural cooling, the white precipitate was centrifuged and washed with water several times until the pH value was 7. The obtained product was dried at 100 °C and then calcined at 500 °C for 2 hours in air.
2.2. Preparation of UC/TiO2 nanoheterostructures
The UC/TiO2 nanoheterostructures were synthesized through a hydrosol–hydrothermal method. 0.5 mL HNO3 was added into 60 mL deionized water, when mixed well, the as-prepared YbF3-Ho nanoparticles were mixed with 2 g TiO2 (Degussa P25) (corresponding to a weight ratio varying from 5% to 20% with respect to TiO2), and added to the above solution. After stirring intensely for 30 minutes, the solution was heated to 90–95 °C and stirred vigorously for 3 hours, at which point it seemed to be half-transparent. The obtained product was transferred to a teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and hydrothermally treated at 180 °C for 10 hours. The obtained white precipitates were filtrated, washed with deionized water and absolute ethanol several times, dried at 100 °C for 2 hours and then calcined at 500 °C for 2 hours in air.
2.3. Fabrication of photoelectrode
Powders (0.34 g) were dispersed in a solution containing absolute ethanol (1 g), α-terpineol (1.57 g) and ethyl cellulose (0.09 g) as a binder and stirred for 48 hours to form the photoelectrode film paste. TiO2 nanoparticles (Degussa P25) were the reference paste. Photoelectrode films (0.16 cm2, 13 μm) were fabricated using a screen printing method and sintered at 500 °C for 30 min. The N719 dye (0.3 mM, Solaronix SA, Switzerland) was used to sensitize the photoelectrodes at room temperature for 24 hours.
2.4. Characterization
Scanning electron microscope (SEM) micrographs were captured with a Rili SU 8000HSD Series Hitachi New Generation Cold Field Emission SEM. Transmission electron microscopy images were obtained using a FEI TECNIA G20 transmission electron microscope (USA), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns were measured using Cu-Kα radiation with a Shimadzu XRD-6000 X-ray diffraction instrument. Ultraviolet visible near-infrared (UV–Vis–NIR) absorption spectra were recorded using a UV-3600 spectrophotometer (SHIMADZU, JAPAN). Fluorescence spectra were characterized using an Edinburgh FLS 920 fluorescence spectrometer, using a 980 nm laser as the excitation light source. Surface photovoltage (SPV) spectroscopy and transient-state photovoltage (TPV) measurements were performed with a self-assembled device. Monochromatic light was obtained by passing light from a 500 W xenon lamp (CHF-XQ500W, China) through a double-prism monochromator (SBP300, China), and the signal was collected using a lock-in amplifier (SR830, Stanford). As for the TPV measurement, the samples were excited with a third harmonic Nd:YAG laser (Polaris II, New Wave Research) with a 355 nm wavelength (50 μJ) and a pulse width of 5 ns. The obtained TPV signals were recorded with a Digital phosphor oscilloscope (500 MHz, TDS 5054, Tektronix). In order to compare the amounts of absorbed dye, a 0.1 M NaOH solution in water and ethanol (1:1, v/v) was used to desorb the dye from the dye-sensitized films, and the absorption spectra were measured using a UV-2250 spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Japan). The current density–voltage characteristic curves (I–V), electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) and the electron survival lifetimes obtained from open circuit photovoltage decay (OCVD) measurements were recorded using an electrochemical workstation (CHI660D, China). The voltage step and delay time of the photocurrent in the I–V curve measurements were 10 mV and 40 ms, respectively. The EIS spectra were performed under the open voltage bias of −0.8 V at illumination with the frequency ranging from 100 KHz–0.1 Hz and the magnitude of the modulation signal was 0.005 V. The incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) was measured using a Newport IPCE measurement system.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Morphology and structure of UC/TiO2 nanoheterostructures
The average size of the prepared YbF3-Ho is about 30 to 50 nm (see Fig. S1†). The UC/TiO2 was characterized using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM). From Fig. 1(A) we can observe some UC/TiO2 nanoheterostructures with hetero-junction interfaces. The inset image of Fig. 1(B) is the zoomed-in TEM image of one UC/TiO2 nanoheterostructure. The HR-TEM image reveals that on each side of the junction interface, there is one kind of nanoparticle with its own interlayer spacing. As indicated in Fig. 1(B), two kinds of interlayer spacing are found, ∼3.4 Å and ∼3.6 Å, which are in good agreement with the d spacing of the (020) and (101) lattice planes of YbF3-Ho (JCPDS no. 49-1805). We also find an interlayer spacing of about 3.5 Å, corresponding to the d spacing of the (101) lattice plane of TiO2 (JCPDS no. 21-1272). The two different nanoparticles are joined together via a hetero-junction interface, which further confirms the formation of a UC/TiO2 nanoheterostructure. The elemental composition of UC/TiO2 is confirmed by energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis, and the X-ray diffraction (XRD) of UC/TiO2 shows diffraction patterns assignable to both TiO2 and YbF3-Ho (see Fig. S2†).

3.2. Upconversion fluorescence properties of UC/TiO2 and its energy transfer mechanism in DSSCs
The interaction between TiO2 and YbF3-Ho are revealed under excitation at 980 nm. In Fig. 2, we tested the upconversion fluorescence spectra of YbF3-Ho, UC/TiO2 and a mixture of UC and TiO2 (mechanically mixed only). The upconverted fluorescence of YbF3-Ho shows three characteristic Ho3+ emission bands at 545 nm, 650 nm and 750 nm originating from (5S2, 5F4) → 5I8, 5F5 → 5I8, and (5S2, 5F4) → 5I7, respectively. Compared with the spectrum of YbF3-Ho, the upconversion intensity of the UC and TiO2 mixture decreases a little. This decrease is attributed to the lower fraction of YbF3-Ho in the mixture as a whole. However, the hetero-junction interface between YbF3-Ho and TiO2 results in an efficient EET process within UC/TiO2 nanoheterostructure. The green emission located at 545 nm is drastically attenuated, the emission centered at 750 nm has nearly disappeared and the red emission is quenched a little. From the inset CIE image, it is clear that the original YbF3-Ho displays a green color, while the UC/TiO2 shows a yellow color. According to the energy levels of the excited states (5S2, 5F4), which were higher than that of the TiO2 conduction band, the excited electrons located at the (5S2, 5F4) levels could thus transfer into the conduction band of TiO2via the hetero-junction interfaces. As a result, the emissions centered at 545 nm and 750 nm are largely weakened while the red emission of Ho3+ does not change much, since the energy of its excited state is near to the TiO2 conduction band. The LET process between YbF3-Ho and N719 are depicted in the ESI (see Fig. S3 and S4†).
 Fig. 2  Upconversion fluorescence spectra of YbF3-Ho, the UC/TiO2 nanoheterostructures and the UC and TiO2 mixture, all of the samples were excited at 980 nm. 
According to the energy levels of the excited states (5S2, 5F4), which are higher than the level of the TiO2 conduction band and its ground state energy level is lower than that of the I−/I3− redox couple (See Fig. 3). All of the above conditions allowed the excited electrons to inject into the TiO2 conduction band and the redox couple to reduce the oxidized YbF3-Ho. We thought that there were two processes happening: (1) an electron injection process where the excited electrons located at suitable levels could (partially) be injected into the conduction band of TiO2via the hetero-junction interfaces and (2) a luminescence-mediated energy transfer (LET) process where the luminescence of the upconversion emission could be absorbed by the sensitizer. Through the two energy transfer processes, the photocurrent and overall conversion efficiency of DSSCs should be able to be improved.

3.3. Photogenerated charge transfer properties of UC/TiO2
In Fig. 4(A), we tested the SPV of TiO2, UC/TiO2 with different weight ratios and the 5% mechanical mixture of UC and TiO2. The SPV method is a non-contact technique to characterize a conductor that mainly analyzes the illumination induced change in the surface photovoltage and is only sensitive to the electron transition-related process and subsequent separation.33,41,42 Since the photovoltage response intensity is related to the charge separation efficiency, a stronger SPS response intensity signified a higher separation efficiency of photoinduced charges. TiO2 is the best semiconducting photoelectrode material with its chemical stability, strong charge separation and the long lifetime of excited electrons. The SPV response is in the range of 300 to 420 nm, due to the band to band transition (from the valence band to the conduction band). In comparison with TiO2, UC/TiO2 produces stronger SPV responses, especially for the 5%-UC/TiO2, which implies that UC/TiO2 has a higher separation efficiency of photoinduced charges than TiO2. However, when the mix ratio is over 5%, the SPV responses begin to decrease. As we know, YbF3-Ho itself is a poor electronic conductor and agglomeration of YbF3-Ho will result in an increased migration distance of photoinduced charges that will affect charge separation negatively. Therefore the 20%-UC/TiO2 has a weaker response than TiO2. The SPV result of the YbF3-Ho and TiO2 mixture with the ratio of 5% (mechanically mixed only) was tested too. Compared with 5%-UC/TiO2, the SPV response intensity of the 5% mechanical mixture is much lower, which indicates that the photoinduced charge separation is harder. These results confirm the advantage of the UC/TiO2 nanoheterostructure system, improving upon the existing merits of TiO2 through facilitating the interfacial photoinduced charge separation.

We also used the TPV technique to investigate the dynamic properties of the photoinduced charge transfer process and lifetime in the TiO2 and as-synthesized UC/TiO2 nanoheterostructures.43 As shown in Fig. 4(B), positive TPV responses are observed for all of the samples, indicating that positive charges move towards the surface while negative charges transfer towards the bottom of the material. It is interesting to find that the photovoltage response of the 5%-UC/TiO2 nanoheterostructures significantly increased to ∼8.4 times higher than that of TiO2. Through this electron transfer process, the electron–hole pairs generated in the excited TiO2 could be efficiently separated, thus resulting in the improved photovoltage response of the UC/TiO2 nanoheterostructures. Meanwhile, it can also be seen that the TPV maximum point of the 5%-UC/TiO2 nanoheterostructures is prolonged from ∼9.9 × 10−7 s to ∼6.9 × 10−5 s, which means that the charge recombination process is hindered and the excited electron lifetimes are prolonged. The longer the lifetime is, the slower the recombination rate of the electron–hole pairs will be. These results further confirmed that the UC/TiO2 nanoheterostructure system can retard the photoinduced charge recombination and improve the excited electron lifetimes.
3.4. Photovoltaic performances of DSSCs with UC/TiO2 photoelectrodes
In order to prove that the excited electrons located at the (5S2, 5F4) energy level transferred to the conduction band of TiO2via the hetero-junction interfaces, we tested the solar cells composed of UC/TiO2 without a sensitizer under 1.5G. In Fig. 5, the cells composed of UC/TiO2 (5%–15%) have a higher photocurrent and voltage than those of the cell composed of TiO2. The corresponding photocurrent–voltage (I–V) parameters are listed in Table S1.† Compared with the TiO2 based cells, the photocurrent (Jsc) increases from 0.11 to the highest value of 0.24 mA cm−2. Because there is no dye, the photocurrent cannot originate from the electron injection from the dye to TiO2 or the LET process. If the upconversion particles are inserted into the DSSC electrode structure without forming hetero-junction interfaces, they will serve as surface recombination centers that will enable capture of the photoinjected electrons by I3− in the electrolyte.44,45 Therefore we can confirm that the hetero-junction interfaces in the UC/TiO2 nanoheterostructures create a photocurrent via the excited-electron injection from YbF3-Ho to the TiO2 conduction band. This result demonstrates that the upconversion function can work under 1.5G solar light. When the YbF3-Ho weight ratio with respect to TiO2 is over 5%, based on the previous discussion, agglomeration will hinder the charge separation and increase the possibility of I3− ions capturing the injected electrons from the TiO2 conduction band. Therefore, the photocurrent will begin to decrease.
 Fig. 5  Photocurrent–voltage curves of solar cells without N719 under AM 1.5G. 
The overall performances of the DSSCs were investigated under standard conditions (see Fig. 6(A)) and the corresponding I–V parameters of the DSSCs are listed in Table 1. The best energy conversion efficiency of the DSSC devices is 8.0%, when the DSSCs contain 5 wt% UC/TiO2. Compared with the DSSCs composed of TiO2, the photocurrent is improved by 19% and the conversion efficiency is enhanced by 23%. As the wt% of UC/TiO2 increases, the Jsc first rises and then descends. The amounts of the absorbed dye at the films were calculated and are listed in Table 1. It can be seen that, when the wt% of UC/TiO2 increases, an obvious decrease occurs to the dye loading amount, which means that the enhancement of the photocurrent is not related to the amount of dye absorption. This obvious decrease in the amount of absorbed dye is the result of the decreased surface area of the TiO2 porous photoelectrode film. It is well known that the photocurrent mainly depends on three factors: light harvesting capacity, dye-loading, as well as the dynamics of the interfacial losses from the charge recombination.12,13,46 Thus, based on the previous discussion, we concluded that the increase of Jsc mainly resulted from the more efficient electron transfer and charge separation, direct electron-injection via the hetero-junction interface between YbF3-Ho and TiO2 and the LET process. However, when the wt% was over 5%, agglomeration of the YbF3-Ho nanoparticles would influence the electronic conduction of TiO2, negatively affect the charge separation and result in a decrease in the photocurrent. The interfacial losses from the charge recombination would also influence the photocurrent, which will be discussed later. Voc is generally related to the amount of dye adsorption, flat band potential and the charge recombination between the conduction band electrons and the I3− ions at the TiO2|dye|electrolyte interface.47,48 From Table 1, we can see that Voc rises with the wt% increase. Mott-Schottky is one of the commonly used approaches to estimate the flat band potential (Vfb) of a semiconductor. As shown in Fig. S5,† the Vfb values of the UC/TiO2 electrodes show a negative shift compared with the TiO2 electrode. Such a negative shift in the Vfb value suggests a correspondingly higher Voc value in the DSSCs composed of UC/TiO2.

EIS analysis was performed to investigate the internal resistance in order to give a good insight into the interfacial dynamics of the charge transfer and recombination process in the DSSCs. In Fig. 6(B), we can see three obvious semicircles are detected in the Nyquist plots, which are related to the electron transfer resistance (R2) at the Pt|I3−/I− electrolyte interface, electron transport resistance (Rct) in the photoelectrode|dye|electrolyte interface and the Nernst diffusion of the iodide species within the electrolyte, respectively. The EIS data obtained by fitting the impedance spectra are shown in Table S2,† and the equivalent model is shown in the inset of Fig. 6(B). It can clearly be seen that the DSSCs composed of the UC/TiO2 electrodes exhibit smaller Rct (5.35 Ω, 7.01 Ω and 7.96 Ω, respectively for the 5%, 10% and 15% UC/TiO2 electrodes) than that of the DSSC composed of the TiO2 electrode (8.75 Ω). It is noted that the lower interfacial resistance can result in faster interfacial electron transfer, which is beneficial for improving photoelectric conversion efficiency. But the 20% UC/TiO2 has a higher Rct (10.02 Ω), which is caused by the agglomeration effect of YbF3-Ho, as in the above discussion. A higher Rct will increase the possibility of the oxidized dye molecules and I3− ions capturing the photoinjected electrons, and will result in a lower photocurrent.
Then, we investigated the interfacial recombination process in the DSSCs between the photoinjected electrons and the redox species through the OCVD technique. The decayed open-circuit voltage reflects the decreased electron concentration, which is mainly caused by charge recombination. Fig. 6(C) shows the electron survival lifetime as a function of the Voc. It is found that the electron survival lifetime of the DSSC with the 5% UC/TiO2 electrode is longer than that with the TiO2 electrode, indicating a reduced recombination process between the injected electrons and the electrolyte. The higher the weight ratio of YbF3-Ho and TiO2 when mixing, the shorter the electron lifetime obtained. Agglomeration effects led to the capturing of the injected electrons by I3− ions. Therefore, poor dye-loading but elevated Vfb and lowered charge recombination accounted for the increased Voc, and the reduced transfer resistance and restrained recombination process also contributed to a higher photocurrent.
As we expected, the whole IPCE values for the DSSC with UC/TiO2 (5%–15%) electrodes increase obviously (see Fig. S6†). Based on previous analysis, this whole enhancement can be interpreted from the following aspect: the UC/TiO2 nanoheterostructures induce easy charge separation, restrain the recombination of injected electrons with I3− ions in the electrolyte and prolong the electron lifetimes, which could result in higher electron collection efficiency and thus improve the IPCE value. It is noted that the IPCE spectra shows a measurable response in the near-IR region, confirming the contribution of UC/TiO2 in the DSSCs for near-IR light conversion. In Scheme 1, we have outlined the mechanism of near-IR sunlight harvesting in UC/TiO2 DSSCs.

4. Conclusions
In conclusion, we successfully designed and explored new up-conversion YbF3-Ho/TiO2 nanoheterostructures as a photoelectrode material in DSSCs. These UC/TiO2 nanoheterostructures not only induced direct electron-injection from YbF3-Ho to TiO2 by utilizing near-infrared light, but also further improved the existing merits of TiO2 through facilitating the interfacial photoinduced charge separation, suppressing the photoinduced charge recombination and prolonging the lifetime of the excited electrons. When integrating the UC/TiO2 nanoheterostructures into DSSCs, the internal transfer resistance was decreased and the interfacial recombination process was restrained, thus the electron lifetime became longer. There was a 23% enhancement in the overall conversion efficiency and a 19% improvement in the photocurrent. This work provides an efficient photoelectrode material for DSSCs and a strategy to improve the photovoltaic performances of UCNP-assisted DSSCs. We believe that these UC/TiO2 nanoheterostructures, combined with other improvements in upconversion efficiency (plasmonic coupling may offer routes for successful upconversion enhancement49,50), structural design optimization and new sensitizers, such as quantum dots and panchromatic sensitizers, will soon make dye-sensitized solar cells with higher conversion efficiencies.
