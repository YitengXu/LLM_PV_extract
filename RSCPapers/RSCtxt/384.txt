1. Introduction
Organic semiconductors are intensively investigated from the viewpoints of their fundamental optoelectronic properties and their potential applications in organic field-effect transistors (OFETs),1 organic light-emitting diodes,2 and photovoltaic cells.3 Most conjugated organic systems have inherently low electron affinities and therefore behave as p-type semiconductors and as hole-transport materials.4 Recent advances in p-type organic semiconductors have fulfilled many of the requirements for use in diverse applications. However, n-type materials needed for complementary circuits present a challenge for chemists. New n-type organic semiconductors should have a suitable electron affinity larger than oxygen (1.46 eV),5 excellent electron-transporting properties, and good solubility in organic solvents. The long-term exploration of this subject has shown the difficulty in fulfilling all of these desired properties simultaneously.6
One strategy to obtain air stable n-type organic semiconductors is modifying a conjugated core with strong electron-withdrawing substituents to lower its LUMO energy level so that the electron charge carriers are less susceptible to oxidation.7 The most frequently used side groups so far are fluoro/fluoroalkyl8 and cyano/dicyanomethylene9 substituents. Dicyanomethylene-substituted quinoidal oligothiophene showed superior n-type characteristics.9a,10 Recently, Takimiya and co-workers have synthesized highly soluble dicyanomethylene-substituted oligothiophenes with high electron mobilities (up to 0.16 cm2 V−1 s−1, Ion/Ioff ≈ 1×103).11 However, dicyanovinyl-substituted compounds as electron-transport materials are rarely studied,12 especially oligomers. To date, Uhrich et al. have synthesized dicyanovinyl-substituted oligothiophenes reaching open circuit voltages of up to 1.04 V for solar cells (power conversion efficiencies of up to 1.6%).12b Here, we selected the dicyanovinyl group as the substituent because it has the following advantages: (i) the double bond can participate in the conjugation of the whole π-system and lead to efficient intermolecular interactions; (ii) the cyano groups have strong electron-accepting properties and may be useful for electron injection as suggested for a compound possessing pentafluorobenzene groups;8c (iii) the substituent can be easily introduced at the aromatic ring to control the HOMO–LUMO energy gap and the molecular packing. The fluorene and carbazole cores were chosen because they can increase the air stability of materials by lowering the HOMO energy level13 and are suitable materials for OFETs.14,15 Furthermore, the long alkyl chains can be easily introduced in the 9-position of the fluorene and carbazole rings, which may increase the solubility of the compounds and benefit the fabrication of devices. The hexyl side chain is optimum for charge transport due to its better self-organization.1c,16
In this paper, we report the synthesis and characterization of the dicyanovinyl-capped and fluorene or carbazole-based oligomers FBCN, FTCN, CBCN and CTCN. The introduction of benzene or thiophene rings is to extend π-conjugated systems. To the best of our knowledge, this series of compounds has not been reported. They would be promising electron transport materials as n-type organic semiconductors. The target compounds are characterized in detail, and their electronic properties are studied by UV-vis/fluorescence spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry. The solid state structure of FTCN has been investigated (Fig. 1).

2. Results and discussion
2.1. Synthesis and characterization
The target compounds FBCN, FTCN, CBCN and CTCN were synthesized via the Stille coupling reaction as illustrated in Scheme 1. Two types of cores of dialkylfluorene and alkylcarbazole were used. The alkyl substituents would increase the solubility of the target molecules in common organic solvents. 2,7-Dibromodialkylfluorene (2) was obtained by brominating with Br2 solution directly from dialkylfluorene in high yield. 2,7-Dibromodialkylcarbazole (6) was prepared from alkylation of 2,7-dibromocarbazole (5) in high yield, and 5 was achieved by an efficient two-step synthesis according to the literature.17 In this study, we use 2,7-dibromocarbazole because the 2,7-substituted carbazole is more favorable to the conjugation of the whole system relative to a 3,6-substituted one.18 The synthetic methods for 319 and 420 were both reported in the literature under different reaction conditions. Here, we synthesized them under the same conditions via a Knoevenagel reaction.21 In this reaction, malononitrile was condensed under Knoevenagel conditions (basic Al2O3 in dry toluene) with an aldehyde  functionality to form the dicyanovinyl substituent. The corresponding compounds 3 and 4 were isolated in 71% and 72% yields. In the next step, dibromofluorene (2) and dibromocarbazole (6) were treated with n-BuLi and tri-n-butyltin chloride to afford the stannylated fluorene and carbazole. The organostannane was used directly in the next step without further purification. Stannylated fluorene reacted with 2 equiv. of compound 3 or 4 to afford the target products FBCN and FTCN in 51% and 53% yields, respectively. Similarly, stannylated carbazole was reacted with 2 equiv. of compound 3 or 4 to afford the target products CBCN and CTCN in 46% and 45% yields, respectively. As a general procedure, the reaction was performed using PdCl2(PPh3)2 as a catalyst in toluene. For comparison, 7 and 8 were prepared under Suzuki cross-coupling conditions, and 7 has been reported in the literature.22 Product 8 was isolated in reasonable yield (58%). The target molecules FBCN and FTCN are soluble in most common organic solvents, and the solubility of molecules CBCN and CTCN are moderate and inferior to FBCN and FTCN. Their structures were confirmed by 1HNMR, 13CNMR, EI-MS, and HRMS spectrometric methods.

2.2. Solid state structure of compound FTCN
The solubility of compound FTCN is the best in this series of target compounds, and it can form crystals very easily. We obtained red cuboid single crystals of FTCN by slow diffusion of 2 : 1 hexane–ethyl acetate. Unfortunately, the single crystals of other target compounds FBCN, CBCN and CTCN have not been obtained. An X-ray diffraction study was performed on the crystal of FTCN to determine its solid state structure (see ESI‡ ). As shown in Fig. 2, the molecular backbone is nearly planar (excluding the hexyl groups), and has a very slight twist along its long axis. The two dicyanovinyl end groups both deviated only 4° from the plane. The S atoms of thiophenes and the bridging carbon atom of the fluorene segment all face the same side. The two substituted alkyl chains are asymmetric. One is nearly perpendicular to the conjugate plane (∼90°), and the other is reclined to 126° with respect to the plane.
 Fig. 2  Crystal structure of the molecule FTCN. (Top) top view. (Bottom) side view. 
Another peculiar structural feature of the compound concerns its molecular packing. The conjugate planes stack in an arrangement with a honeycomb, graphite structure (Fig. S3‡ ). For the fluorene–thiophene co-oligomers, such a kind of packing structure is rarely reported in the literature.13b The crystal structure is characterized by a “layer-by-layer” stacking mode viewed down the b-axis (Fig. 3), and the molecular arrangement is interdigitated and has parallel layers like a “bricklayer” structure. The unit cell contains four layers along the c-axis. Molecules pack in such a way that nearest neighbor molecules in the central two layers have the fluorene ring pointing in opposite directions. The mean distance between layers is 3.5 Å. The central two layers demonstrate a C–S short contact of 3.57 Å, and the side two layers demonstrate C–C short contacts of 3.39 Å and 3.55 Å. These data are indicated with dashed lines in Fig. 3. These distances are close to the van der Waals radii of sulfur–carbon (3.45–3.5 Å) and carbon–carbon (3.3–3.4 Å) atom pairs.9b These obviously indicate that π–π interactions exists between layers. However, due to the steric hindrance that the two asymmetric alkyl chains impose, the adjacent molecules between layers are interdigitated and oriented to form a ring (Fig. S2‡ ). Endless π–π stacking of the molecules' conjugated backbones results in infinite columns of porous structure with alkyl chains lying in the middle of rings (Fig. S3‡ ). This structure resembles a honeycomb graphite structure. Through packing of columns of rings, it extends the π stacking of the aromatic rings, leading to efficient electron transport in well-ordered thin films.

2.3. Optical properties
The electronic spectra of oligomers FBCN, FTCN, CBCN and CTCN were recorded in a CH2Cl2 solution and as thin films on quartz substrates (Table 1). 7 and 8 were studied under the same conditions to allow proper comparisons between dicyanovinyl-substituted and unsubstituted analogues.
The absorption spectra of the target compounds in solution exhibit three absorption bands, the absorption band at 289–308 nm is assigned to the π–π* transition (Fig. 4). Compared with 7 and 8, respectively, FTCN and CTCN exhibit a large bathochromic shift (114 nm and 122 nm) of the absorption maximum (Fig. S4‡ ), which is attributed to the dicyanovinyl group taking part in the conjugation and the great stabilization of the LUMO by the electron-withdrawing groups.23 Meanwhile, the introduction of electron-withdrawing groups produces the emergence of a new band at 400–550 nm assigned to an intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) between the aromatic ring donor part and the acceptor end groups.24 The absorption bands of FBCN and CBCN are similar to those of FTCN and CTCN. The different cores (fluorene or carbazole) cannot bring obvious shifts of the absorption maxima in solution, but the introduction of different aromatic rings (thiophene or benzene) results in obvious bathochromic shifts. The compound containing thiophene segments FTCN (or CTCN) produces more than 50 nm bathochromic shift of the absorption maximum, much larger than one containing benzene segments FBCN (or CBCN). The results indicate that thiophene moieties enhance the charge transfer from the electron-rich moieties to electron-withdrawing groups. Their absorption spectra reveal similar trends in the solid state as shown in Fig. 5. Films were easily formed by spin coating from THF (1 mg ml−1, quartz substrate). Optical band gaps (Table 1) in solution and solid state were approximated by extrapolation of the low-energy side of the absorption spectra to the baseline.25 As expected, the energy band gaps of compounds decrease in the order, 7 > 8 > FBCN > CBCN > FTCN > CTCN, either in solution or in the solid state.

The fluorescence spectra of the target compounds in solution cover the visible spectrum from yellow to orange assigned to the πAr → π*CV ICT excited state.24b The phenomenon of bathochromic shifts of the emission maxima is not identical to the optical absorption. The emission maxima increase is in the order, FBCN < FTCN < CBCN < CTCN (Table 1), and the peak of FTCN almost overlaps with that of CBCN. Furthermore, the gradually increasing trend is more clearly observed in the solid state (Fig. 5). The emission spectrum of FTCN exhibits a blue shift relative to CBCN opposite to their absorption spectrum. This is clearly supported by the Stokes shifts between the fluorescence emission and the absorption maxima. The Stokes shifts of the target compounds are relatively large, ranging from 70 to 121 nm in solution and from 88 to 148 nm in the solid state. In both states, FTCN has the smallest Stokes shift and CBCN has the largest one. The reason could be that the dipole moment of CBCN is larger than that of FTCN, and the emitting state of the former would be more stabilized by the ICT.26 The fluorescence spectra of 7 and 8 in solution exhibit obvious blue shifts of the emission maxima with photoluminescence in the blue with respect to FTCN and CTCN, consistent with the absorption spectra (Fig. S4‡ ). The fluorescence spectra of FTCN and CTCN in the solid state present broader bandwidths with respective to those in solution.
From the solution to the solid state, the absorption and fluorescence spectra of the target compounds are red-shifted (see Table 1), due to the presence of stronger interactions between molecules (packing effect) in the solid state.27 As shown in the single crystal structure (Fig. 3 and S3‡ ), FTCN has good π–π stacking in the solid state. The bathochromic shift of the UV-vis absorption observed in the solid state also can be explained by the crystal structure of FTCN that shows the J-aggregate conformation (Fig. 3). For the four target compounds, the bathochromic shifts of the absorption and emission maxima obviously show that the carbazole-based compounds shift to longer wavelengths relative to the fluorene-based compounds (Table 1). The difference in the molecular structure gives rise to the change in spectrum. The presence of two hexyl chains in the 9-position of the fluorene ring increases the intermolecular distances and thereby prevents better π stacking of the molecules,28 which can be also confirmed by the crystal structure of FTCN (Fig. S2‡ ). The alkyl effect is reduced by the carbazole ring with one hexyl chain at the N atom, leading to stronger π stacking of the carbazole-based molecules.27 When comparing dicyanovinyl-substituted compounds (FTCN and CTCN) with unsubstituted compounds (7 and 8), the absorption maxima of 7 and 8 are nearly invariant, but the introduction of dicyanovinyl groups strengthens intermolecular interactions in the solid state and results in the red-shift of the absorption maxima from the solution to solid state (Table 1).
2.4. Electrochemical properties
In order to investigate the electrochemical behaviors of oligomers FBCN, FTCN, CBCN, CTCN, 7 and 8, cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were performed in CH2Cl2 containing 0.1 M n-Bu4NPF6 as a supporting electrolyte. The electrochemical potentials are summarized in Table 2. The CV of FBCN, FTCN, CBCN and CTCN displayed irreversible oxidative and reduction processes, while the CV of 7 and 8 only displayed irreversible oxidative processes under the same experimental conditions. Because of the introduction of the dicyanovinyl groups, the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of molecules are both lowered to a certain extent. Compared with unsubstituted compounds 7 and 8, HOMO energy levels of FTCN and CTCN are stabilized by 0.27 eV and 0.28 eV, respectively. For the four target compounds, fluorene-based compounds display lower HOMO energy levels with respect to carbazole-based compounds. The HOMO energy level is mainly attributed to the contribution of the core (fluorene or carbazole) which leads to a stable energy level. The low HOMO levels may bring the target compounds good air stability. In the reduction processes, oligomers containing thiophene segments show lower LUMO energy levels with respect to ones containing benzene segments, indicating that thiophene segments shows larger contribution to n-type behavior. Electrochemical band gaps (Table 2) were calculated from the onset potentials of the anodic and cathodic processes and coincide with the calculated optical band gaps. Our results indicate that the target compounds would be ideal n-type materials.

2.5. Thermal properties
The thermal properties of the target compounds were evaluated by thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). TGA revealed the onset decomposition temperatures of compounds FBCN, FTCN, CBCN and CTCN at 374 °C, 371 °C, 382 °C, and 372 °C, respectively. The results indicate their good thermal stability. As shown in Fig. 6, the heating and cooling DSC scans of the target compounds show no glass transitions up to 270–300 °C, due to the dense molecular packing.29 Carbazole-based compounds CBCN and CTCN were both highly crystalline, exhibiting reversible thermal transitions and only a sharp melting point at 252 °C and 280 °C, respectively. In contrast, fluorene-based compounds behave totally differently. FBCN exhibited a sharp melting point at 216 °C lower than CBCN in the heating segment, and formed an amorphous state in the cooling segment. FTCN formed an amorphous state basically during the heating and cooling, and exhibited a broad and weak exothermic peak around 175 °C. These results further confirm the aforementioned alkyl effect where the molecules of carbazole-based compounds containing one hexyl chain are packed more tightly than those of fluorene-based compounds containing two hexyl chains. No phase transition at low temperatures indicates the series of compounds are highly desirable for application in devices.

3. Conclusions
A new series of fluorene or carbazole-based and dicyanovinyl-capped oligomers consisting of benzene or thiophene segments FBCN, FTCN, CBCN and CTCN have been synthesized and characterized. Optical spectra of these materials suggest that the introduction of electron-accepting groups induces an intramolecular charge transfer, resulting in a shift of the absorption onset towards longer wavelengths. Moreover, the optical spectra of their films show intermolecular interactions, leading to bathochromic shifts with respect to the spectra in solution. Coupled with thermal properties, the molecules of carbazole-based compounds are packed more tightly than those of fluorene-based compounds due to the alkyl effect. The crystal structure of FTCN also displays extended π stacking of molecules in the solid state. In addition, this class of materials shows suitable HOMO and LUMO energy levels, and the compounds attaching thiophene segments show lower LUMO energy levels. They also exhibited good thermal stability and no phase transition at low temperature. These behaviors make them promising candidates for n-channel semiconductors. Experiments are underway to test this hypothesis.

Chemicals were purchased from Aldrich, Alfa Aesar and used as received. Solvents and other common reagents were obtained from the Beijing Chemical Plant. THF and Toluene were dried and distilled immediately prior to use. 1HNMR (400 MHz) and 13CNMR (75 and 100 MHz) spectra were obtained on a Bruker DMX-300 and DMX-400 NMR Spectrometer using tetramethylsilane as the internal standard. High-resolution mass spectra (HRMS) and EI MS were both recorded on a Micromass GCT-MS spectrometer. Electronic absorption spectra were measured on a Jasco V570 UV-vis spectrophotometer. Emission spectra were recorded on a Hitachi F-4500 fluorescence spectrometer. TGA measurements were carried out on a TA SDT 2960 instrument under a dry nitrogen flow, heating from room temperature (RT) to 500 °C, with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. DSC analyses were performed on a TA DSC 2010 instrument under a dry N2 flow, heating from −85 °C to 270–300 °C and cooling from 270–300 °C to −85 °C at a rate of 10 °C min−1. Cyclic voltammetric measurements were carried out in a conventional three-electrode cell using Pt button working electrodes of 2 mm diameter, a platinum wire counter electrode, and a Ag/AgCl reference electrode on a computer-controlled CHI660C instruments at RT. X-Ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were carried out in the reflection mode at RT using a Rigaku MM-007 X-ray diffraction system (Mo Kα radiation, λ = 0.71073 Å). 9,9-Bis-n-hexylfluorene (1),302,7-dibromo-9,9-bis-n-hexylfluorene (2),302,7-dibromocarbazole (5),172,7-dibromo-9-(2-hexyl)carbazole (6),15a and 2,7-Bis(thiophene-2-yl)-9,9-bis-n-hexylfluorene (7)22 were synthesized according to literature or slightly modified procedures.
