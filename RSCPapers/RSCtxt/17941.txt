    , Accepted 15th December 2015First published on 15th December 2015AbstractBuilding a tandem structure is an effective strategy to enhance the photovoltaic performance of solar cells. In the realization of a two-terminal tandem device, the charge recombination layer (CRL) plays an essential role. In the current study, we demonstrate the first bottom-up solution-processed two-terminal perovskite/perovskite tandem solar cell via developing a novel CRL: spiro-OMeTAD/PEDOT:PSS/PEI/PCBM:PEI. This CRL is efficient to collect electrons and holes at its top and bottom surfaces, and robust enough to protect the bottom perovskite film during the top perovskite film deposition. Moreover, the CRL is prepared by orthogonal solvent processing at low temperature, which is compatible with the pre-deposited perovskite film underneath. The PEI/PCBM:PEI is specially developed for efficient electron collection in both single-junction and tandem perovskite solar cells. With the optimized CRL to bridge the two CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite subcells, the tandem solar cell yields an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of up to 1.89 V that is close to the sum of the two perovskite subcells.
1. Introduction
Organic–inorganic metal halide perovskite solar cells with power conversion efficiency (PCE) over 20% at lab-scale devices are extraordinarily exciting for solar energy utilization.1 Such rapid enhancement of the efficiency is mainly attributed to the tremendous efforts on the optimization of perovskite active layers (morphology and crystallinity) as well as the interface modification.2–20 Besides these strategies, designing new device configurations is also promising for further photovoltaic performance enhancement. A multi-junction or tandem structure has been proved to enhance the efficiency of organic or other types of solar cells. So far, the highest efficiency is delivered by tandem structures where three or four III–V semiconducting active layers which absorb photons of different spectral regions are stacked to maximize the harvest of the solar irradiative spectrum. Previous reports on perovskite-involved tandem solar cells have covered two-terminal perovskite/polymer,21 and perovskite/silicon tandem structures,22 as well as four-terminal electrically wired silicon/perovskite and CIGS/perovskite tandem structures.23,24 So far, there is still no report on bottom-up two terminal perovskite–perovskite solar cells, mainly due to the lack of CRL that is compatible with humidity- and polar solvent-sensitive perovskite films.
The key to realize an all-solution processable bottom-up two-terminal perovskite/perovskite tandem cell is to find an appropriate CRL: (i) the CRL needs to possess a large work function contrast between the top and the bottom surface for electron- and hole-collection, respectively; (ii) the CRL can be processed at low temperatures to avoid any damage to the underlying perovskite cell from post-thermal annealing. In particular, the high temperature sintering that is required for TiO2 preparation is not suitable for the processing of the CRL; (iii) orthogonal solvents are required to process each adjacent layer. In other words, processing of subsequent layers should not wash away pre-deposited functioning layers, especially for the reason that the perovskite film is very sensitive to water and other commonly used polar solvents; (iv) since the two perovskite layers in the tandem solar cell share the same solvent, the CRL needs to be protective enough to prevent solvent penetration during the top perovskite layer deposition.
Here we develop a novel type of CRL (spiro-OMeTAD/PEDOT:PSS/PEI/PCBM:PEI), which can efficiently meet all the requirements for fabricating a fully solution-processed perovskite/perovskite tandem solar cell. The whole device structure (glass/FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/spiro-OMeTAD/PEDOT:PSS/PEI/PCBM:PEI/CH3NH3PbI3/spiro-OMeTAD/hc-PEDOT:PSS) is shown in Fig. 1(a), where the CRL lies between two perovskite films and serially connects the two subcells. Note that here hc-PEDOT:PSS denotes the highly conductive PEDOT:PSS transparent top electrode. The chemical structures of the four components in the CRL are displayed in Fig. 1(b). In the as-prepared perovskite/perovskite tandem device, the electrons are collected by the FTO side and holes by the top PEDOT:PSS side, while CRL provides a site for efficient charge recombination. The properties of the CRL include: (i) the spiro-OMeTAD and PCBM are adopted to favor the hole and electron collection, respectively, while the PEI is used to modify the surface and to form a work function contrast between the top and bottom sides of the PEDOT:PSS film;25,26 (ii) all functioning layers in the CRL can be processed at low temperatures (no more than 100 °C) with a short time thermal annealing (total annealing time of the CRL is less than 5 min), minimizing the detrimental effect on the underlying perovskite film; (iii) the processing solvents for each adjacent layer in the CRL are orthogonal, with chlorobenzene being the solvent for spiro-OMeTAD and PCBM:PEI, and isopropanol for the PEI and dry transfer of PEDOT:PSS. Here, the chlorobenzene and isopropanol are safe solvents for the underlying perovskite film. Conversely, the perovskite is very sensitive to water and direct coating of PEDOT:PSS aqueous solution will decompose CH3NH3PbI3 into PbI2. Therefore, the PEDOT:PSS film transfer technique, which has been proven to be safe for perovskite films in our previous work,27 is employed for the PEDOT:PSS film deposition. (iv) Finally, all four functioning layers in the CRL, with excellent film-forming abilities and a total thickness over 200 nm, can be protective enough to avoid solvent penetration during the upper perovskite film deposition.

Besides the selection of CRL, processing of the perovskite film is also very critical. Basically, the perovskite film of the bottom subcell needs to be very smooth and nonporous to avoid the short circuit of the device; meanwhile, fast crystallization during perovskite film preparation is required to minimize the thermal annealing time, as prolonged post-annealing of the top perovskite film would damage the underlayers in the device. Among various methodologies for perovskite film preparation, the fast crystallization procedure reported by Xiao and coworkers6 can effectively produce a high-quality CH3NH3PbI3 film with a flat surface and excellent coverage without the need for long-time thermal annealing.
To fabricate a perovskite/perovskite tandem solar cell, we start from the two subcells. The typical structure of a glass/FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/spiro-OMeTAD/electrode is adopted in the bottom cell [here, c-TiO2 denotes the compact TiO2 layer and m-TiO2 denotes the mesoporous TiO2 layer]. The J–V curves of devices with a reference Ag electrode and a transfer-laminated hc-PEDOT:PSS electrode are displayed in Fig. 2(b). A summary of the performance parameters is listed in Table 1. Since hc-PEDOT:PSS can transmit light while the reference Ag can provide a reflective surface that allows the perovskite absorber to absorb the light residue from the first pass, JSC for the perovskite solar cell with the hc-PEDOT:PSS electrode would be correspondingly lower than that with the Ag electrode. Meanwhile, devices based on the hc-PEDOT:PSS electrode would display a slightly lower fill factor (FF = 0.62) than Ag based perovskite solar cells (FF = 0.64), which is mainly due to the comparatively lower conductivity (∼300 S cm−1) of hc-PEDOT:PSS than Ag. A single-junction perovskite solar cell used as the bottom subcell yields a PCE of up to 10.1% with a transparent hc-PEDOT:PSS electrode and 11.7% with a Ag electrode.

For the top subcell, we attempted to learn from the previous work by Ryu and co-workers28 with the device structure of glass/ITO/PEI/PCBM/CH3NH3PbI3/spiro-OMeTAD/Ag. Rather than a high-temperature sintered TiO2 electron transporting layer (ETL), the PEI/PCBM ETL can be processed at low temperatures, exactly satisfying the thermal annealing compatibility of a perovskite/perovskite tandem solar cell. Unfortunately, we could only obtain poor J–V curves with this device architecture as shown in Fig. 2(a), even though we extensively optimized the processing conditions of the PEI and PCBM by varying the concentration and spinning speed. The J–V characteristics suggest too resistive electron collection. We innovatively developed a PCBM:PEI mixture to replace pure PCBM. Details of the PCBM:PEI mixture are provided in the experimental section. J–V curves of devices based on the PCBM:PEI mixture are also included in Fig. 2(a) with Ag and hc-PEDOT:PSS electrodes. By adding a small amount of PEI into the PCBM solution [PEI:PCBM equals to 1:15 by weight], the corresponding photovoltaic performance can be greatly improved. The resulting PCEs are 11.4% and 8.3% for devices with Ag and hc-PEDOT:PSS electrodes, respectively (Table 1).
To unravel the mystery of the PCBM:PEI mixture, we investigated the properties of the PCBM:PEI film from two types of devices (the device structures are shown in the insets of Fig. 3(a) and b). Fig. 3(a) depicts the J–V curve of the device of glass/ITO/PCBM:PEI/PEDOT:PSS where ITO and hc-PEDOT:PSS are used as the bottom and the top electrodes. An obvious rectification characteristic is observed. The rectification ratio is over 102 at ±1 V as indicated by the inset of Fig. 3(a). The rectification characteristic here suggests a strong phase separation of the PCBM:PEI film, with the PEI falling onto the surface of ITO and reducing its work function.29 As a result, the low-work-function ITO is modified by using the PEI as the cathode and high-work-function hc-PEDOT:PSS as the anode, and a typical rectification characteristic occurs. For comparison, a device with only PCBM as the active layer in the same device geometry was also fabricated. Fig. S1(a)† shows the J–V characteristics that do not show obvious rectification because the work function of ITO is not sufficiently low for efficient electron injection and hole blocking. Conductivity along the PCBM:PEI film (in parallel with the substrate) is also measured using the device shown in the inset of Fig. 3(b). The PCBM:PEI mixture solution is spin-coated onto pre-patterned ITO with a ∼1 mm-wide, ∼25 mm-long channel. The ITO provides a low-resistance electrical contact during the conductivity measurement of the PCBM:PEI film. The as-measured conductivity can be roughly evaluated by the following equation: σ = L/(R × a × t)(1)where L and a denote the channel length and width of the ITO electrodes, respectively (Fig. 3(b)); t denotes the obtained film thickness; R is the resistance obtained from the J–V measurement. The corresponding conductivity is estimated to be around 0.015 S cm−1 for the PCBM:PEI film with a film thickness of approximately 200 nm and measured resistance of 1.34 × 106 Ω. It should be noted that the contact resistance arisen from the contact between ITO and the PCBM:PEI film also contributes to the as-measured resistance, which might result in an overall underestimated conductivity of the PCBM:PEI film. For comparison, the J–V curve of the pure PCBM-based device exhibits a very large resistance as shown in Fig. S1(b).† The current is lower than the measurement limit (100 pA). The conductivity is calculated to be lower than 10−5 S cm−1. Therefore, the greatly enhanced conductivity of the PCBM:PEI film favors the electron transport in the device, thus leading to a better photovoltaic performance.

Fig. 4(a) shows the energy diagram of a complete perovskite/perovskite tandem solar cell. Between the two perovskite layers, the CRL comprising of spiro-OMeTAD/PEDOT:PSS/PEI/PCBM:PEI functions as an efficient site for charge recombination, with holes flowing into the CRL from the bottom subcell and electrons flowing out to the top subcell. In Fig. 4(b), J–V curves of the as-prepared perovskite/perovskite tandem solar cell are compared with light illumination from either the FTO side or the hc-PEDOT:PSS side. The tandem solar cell yields a PCE of up to 7.0% with a VOC of 1.89 V and FF of 0.56. The as-obtained high VOC, which almost equals to the sum of the two subcells, potently verifies the effectiveness of the CRL. In particular, the slight loss in VOC (∼0.1 V) can be ascribed to the detrimental post-annealing effect on the bottom subcell, as the post-annealing arisen from the preparation of the CRL and top subcell would induce large amounts of charge traps at the surface and grain boundaries of the perovskite film.30–32 Moreover, it should be noted that since the two perovskite active layers are CH3NH3PbI3, the non-complementary absorption spectral region accounts for an overall quite low JSC (6.61 mA cm−2) and PCE (∼7.0%) for the as-prepared perovskite/perovskite tandem solar cell illuminated from the top side. This can be further testified by the discrepancy in JSC for devices with different light incident directions (from the top side and the bottom side), as shown in Fig. 3(c). If incident light directions are changed, there would be different amounts of light absorbed by the first subcell and different light residuals for the second subcell. When light illuminates from the bottom side, more unbalanced photon absorption occurs because the coating on the mesoporous TiO2 leads to a thicker perovskite active layer and the scattering of mesoporous TiO2 could possibly reduce the light transmission from the bottom perovskite active layer to the top one. Therefore, it is reasonable that a lower JSC of 5.15 mA cm−2 is obtained when light illuminates from the bottom side rather than from the top side. The hysteresis effect of the two subcells and the tandem cell is tested by J–V characteristics scanned from both reverse and forward directions. As shown in Fig. S2 and Table S1 in the ESI,† the two subcells show slight hysteresis effects, while the tandem solar cell shows obvious hysteresis. An S-shape appears when the cell is scanned in the forward direction. The charge recombination at the CRL and the current matching of the two subcells might be associated with the hysteresis, which is to be further studied in the future.

In summary, we have developed a novel type of CRL, spiro-OMeTAD/PEDOT:PSS/PEI/PCBM:PEI, to serially bridge two perovskite films to construct a bottom-up solution-processed tandem perovskite/perovskite solar cell. This CRL is prepared by orthogonal solvent processing at low temperature, and is free from prolonged thermal annealing. Moreover, the CRL is able to effectively prevent the solvent during the top perovskite film deposition from penetrating through and wash away the bottom perovskite film. The two-junction perovskite/perovskite tandem solar cell yields a VOC of 1.89 V. Though the 7% efficiency of the tandem cell is not sufficiently high, the VOC almost equals to the sum of the two perovskite subcells that confirms the proof-of-concept success of bottom-up solution-processed perovskite/perovskite tandem solar cells. We believe that the efficiency of the perovskite/perovskite tandem solar cell can be further enhanced by balancing the photon absorption of each subcell and via developing new perovskite materials with broader absorption regions. The developed CRL could also inspire other types of high-performance perovskite/organic or inorganic hybrid tandem solar cells.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Bottom perovskite subcell fabrication
Fluorine-tin-oxide (FTO, Pilkington, 7 ohm sq−1) coated glass substrates were patterned by wet etching with zinc powder and diluted hydrochloric acid (hydrochloric acid:de-ionized water = 1:5). The substrates were then cleaned in ultrasonic baths of detergent diluted in de-ionized water, de-ionized water, acetone and isopropanol in sequence. Next, the substrates were blown dry by using a nitrogen flow and then spin-coated with 40 nm compact TiO2 [1 ml isopropyl titanate (Sigma Aldrich), and 0.228 ml ethanol amine (Sigma Aldrich) were dissolved in 12 ml 2-methoxyethanol (Sinopharm Chemical Reagent), and reacted in an airtight glass bottle at 80 °C for 2 hours and 120 °C for 1 hour] and heated at 150 °C for 30 min. After cooling down to room temperature, diluted TiO2 (Dyesol) solution in ethanol (1:4 by weight) was spin-coated onto the compact TiO2 and sintered at 550 °C for 30 min. To deposit the perovskite film, the synthesized CH3NH3I was mixed with PbI2 (Sigma Aldrich) in anhydrous DMF with a concentration of 40 wt%, and clear CH3NH3PbI3 solution was dropped onto the substrates. Six seconds after the initiation of the spin-coating at 4000 rpm, a drop of anhydrous chlorobenzene was quickly dropped onto the center of the substrate. The obtained smooth films were then dried at 100 °C for 5 min.
2.2 Preparation of CRL
The spiro-OMeTAD hole-transporting layer was spin-coated onto the CH3NH3PbI3 film at 5000 rpm for 60 s from a solution mixture [80 mg spiro-OMeTAD (Nichem), 28.8 μL 4-tert-butylpyridine (tBP, Sigma Aldrich) and 17.5 μL lithium-bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI, Sigma Aldrich) solution (520 mg Li-TFSI in 1 mL acetonitrile), dissolved in 1 ml chlorobenzene.]. The thickness of the spiro-OMeTAD layer was measured to be 150 nm by using a surface profiler (Dektak XT, Bruker Corp.). Then, the PEDOT:PSS layer was prepared by a film transfer lamination technique:27 0.1 wt% polyethylene glycol 2,5,8,11-tetramethyl-6-dodecyne-5,8-diol ether (superwet-340, TOYNOL) was added into the PEDOT:PSS dispersion to tune the wetting properties of PDMS. Before the transfer, the PEDOT:PSS formulation was spin-coated onto the PDMS at 4000 rpm for 30 s, resulting in a film with a thickness of approximately 40 nm. After the PEDOT:PSS film transfer, the as-prepared substrate was transferred to the glovebox for thermal annealing at 100 °C for 2 min to remove any remnant water in the PEDOT:PSS film. Then, a PEI layer was deposited on the top of the PEDOT:PSS film by spin-coating from a isopropanol solution with a concentration of 0.1 wt% at 5000 rpm for 1 min and then heated on a hotplate at 100 °C for 1 min. The thickness of the PEI layer was about 2–3 nm based on the previous report estimated by ellipsometry measurements.25 Afterwards, the PCBM:PEI [15 mg PCBM and 1 mg PEI mixed in 1 ml chlorobenzene] electron transporting layer was deposited by a two-step procedure: 500 rpm for 3 s and 2500 rpm for 1 min and then annealed at 100 °C for 1 min. The thickness of the PCBM:PEI layer was measured to be about 40 nm.
2.3 Top perovskite subcell fabrication
The perovskite film wa s prepared via the same anti-solvent single-step spin-coating as described for the bottom cell, except that CH3NH3PbI3 was spin-coated at 5000 rpm rather than 4000 rpm, to deliberately reduce the perovskite film thickness. Also, the spiro-OMeTAD layer was also deposited by the same approach as described in the preparation of the CRL. Finally, the hc-PEDOT:PSS top electrode, consisting 5 wt% ethylene glycol to improve the conductivity and 0.1 wt% superwet-340, was also prepared by transfer lamination. The effective area of the device, ranging from 4 to 10 mm2, was determined by the size of the hc-PEDOT:PSS film and was measured precisely under an optical microscope (DM 4000 M, Leica). The electrical contact during the J–V measurement was guaranteed by coating Ag paint (Ted Pella Inc.) on the edge of the PEDOT:PSS film and FTO.
2.4 PCBM:PEI film characterization
The vertical phase separation of the PCBM:PEI film was verified by using the device with a structure of glass/ITO/PCBM:PEI/PEDOT:PSS. PCBM:PEI solution [40 mg PCBM and 0.4 mg PEI mixed in 1 ml chlorobenzene] was spin-coated at 1000 rpm for 40 s followed by thermal annealing at 100 °C for 10 min. The hc-PEDOT:PSS used here was prepared by the same way as for the perovskite tandem top electrode preparation followed by a 2-minute thermal annealing as well. The conductivity measurement of the PCBM:PEI film was based on a device by spin-coating PCBM:PEI formulation on the top of the pre-patterned ITO electrode.
2.5 Film and device characterization
The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of all devices were measured using a Keithley 2400 source-measure unit. The cells were illuminated by using a Newport solar simulator at a calibrated intensity of 100 mW cm−2. A piece of white paper was used as a reflector during the J–V measurements.
