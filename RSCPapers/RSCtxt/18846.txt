    , Accepted 15th June 2017First published on 15th June 2017AbstractPreparation of highly active, stable and earth-abundant photoanodes for water oxidation is an important strategy to meet the demand of developing clean-energy technologies. In this paper, efficient and stable photoanodes based on oxygen-deficient black WO3−x@TiO2−x core–shell nanosheets with precisely controlled shell thickness have been fabricated for photoelectrochemical (PEC) conversion from neutral water solutions. The black WO3−x@TiO2−x core–shell nanosheet photoanode with the shell thickness of ∼15 nm achieved around 8 times higher photocurrent density (∼3.20 mA cm−2) than the pure WO3 photoanode at 1.23 V vs. the RHE. An improved onset potential with long-term PEC durability was also realized with the obtained black WO3−x@TiO2−x core–shell nanosheet photoanodes. The promoted PEC water oxidation performance was likely to be originated from enhanced light absorption, interfacial charge transfer and charge separation in these WO3−x@TiO2−x nanosheets which were revealed by finite-difference time-domain simulations and specific band alignment, along with optical and electrochemical spectroscopic evidence. In a word, such black WO3−x@TiO2−x nanosheet photoanodes suggest many exciting opportunities for PEC water splitting toward highly efficient solar fuel generation and many other PEC sensing applications.
Introduction
Photoelectrolysis of water-harvesting solar energy to generate clean and renewable chemical energy has captivated tremendous research interest due to its potential to fulfill the increasing energy demands of modern society.1–5 In the past few years, significant efforts have been made to synthesize novel semiconductor materials with sufficient light absorption, efficient charge separation and fast charge transport to serve as photoelectrodes.6–8 Among them, tungsten oxide (WO3) as a photoanode material has gained much attention due to its various advantages in photoelectrochemical (PEC) conversion, such as a moderate band gap (Eg = 2.5–2.8 eV) with around 12% of solar spectrum absorption, a favorable hole diffusion length (Lp ∼150 nm) and a high electron transport rate (∼12 cm2 V−1 s−1).9 To date, WO3 nanostructures with diverse morphologies including nanowires, nanobowls, nanoparticles and nanoplates have been synthesized extensively as photoanode materials.10–14 In particular, WO3 nanosheets obtained via hydrothermal reactions have been proved to exhibit high photoconversion efficiencies in PEC cells owing to their relatively strong optical absorption, low density of grain boundaries in charge-transport paths, and large active surface area.15
Despite the above advantages, the PEC performance of WO3 is however limited by its sluggish kinetics of holes, slow charge transfer rate at the semiconductor/electrolyte interface, and rapid charge recombination, as well as unsatisfactory stability.9 To overcome these problems, much effort has been devoted to improving the PEC performance of WO3 by the construction of hybrid structures with other semiconducting photocatalytic materials such as BiVO3 (ref. 16) and TiO2.17,18 Among them, particularly, TiO2 has been applied in PEC water splitting for a long time since Fujishima and Honda's first report of water splitting on a TiO2 electrode in 1972, due to its favorable band-edge positions, strong optical absorption, superior chemical stability, and photocorrosion resistance.1 In addition, owing to the higher valence band and conduction band positions of TiO2 compared to WO3, coupling WO3 with TiO2 was also demonstrated as an appealing method to promote the charge separation and hence reduce the recombination. For instance, Ali et al.19 fabricated TiO2–WO3 nanorod arrays on a fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrate and achieved nearly 60% higher photoconversion efficiency than pristine TiO2 nanorod arrays when utilized in a PEC cell. Various approaches have been then developed to prepare WO3–TiO2 composites, including spin coating,20 sputtering,21 plasma electrolytic oxidation (PEO),22 electrodeposition,23 and sol–gel chemistry.24 Nonetheless, these traditional methods for forming metal oxide films still suffer from their strict preparation process, hard control of preparation conditions, poor reproducibility, and high cost.
At the same time, tailoring the electronic structures by introducing oxygen vacancies as shallow donors has been demonstrated to be an effective strategy to enhance the PEC performance of metal oxides such as WO3 (ref. 25) and TiO2,26 by facilitating both the electrical conductivity of semiconductors and charge transfer at semiconductor/electrolyte interfaces. Typically, Ti3+ self-doped TiO2 obtained by hydrogen thermal treatment has been proved to be able to absorb almost 100% light across the whole ultraviolet and visible-light bands.27 For example, black TiO2 nanoparticles reported by Chen et al. demonstrated an onset absorption edge of about 1.0 eV and an optical band gap of around 1.54 eV.28 Moreover, the oxygen-deficient WO3 photoanode reported by Wang et al. also turned out to show simultaneously improved photoactivity as well as stability for the solar-driven oxygen evolution reaction (OER).29
Herein, we present for the first time the fabrication of structurally well-defined, oxygen-deficient WO3−x@TiO2−x core–shell nanosheet photoanodes through a sequential process combining atomic layer deposition (ALD) of thickness-controlled TiO2 shells on the surface of WO3 nanosheets and thermal treatment in a hydrogen atmosphere. The ALD technique has been gaining increased attention in surface modification and protection of electrode materials recently due to its unique capabilities for self-limiting surface chemical reactions with accurate thickness control toward extremely uniform and conformal coatings on high aspect ratio structures.30 In this study, the prepared WO3−x@TiO2−x nanosheets were proved to simultaneously possess enhanced light absorption, charge transfer and charge separation based on finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulation, band alignment analysis, and electrochemical characterization. This brought about substantially improved photocurrent density, photostability and low onset potential of the photoanodes. Specifically, the nanosheet-based photoanode with 15 nm thick TiO2−x achieved around 8 times higher photocurrent density (∼3.2 mA cm−2) than the pristine WO3 photoanode (∼0.41 mA cm−2) at 1.23 V vs. the RHE in neutral water solutions (pH = 6.8). Moreover, unlike the original positive onset potential of the pure WO3 nanosheets, a negative onset potential has also been realized after deposition of TiO2 shells on the WO3 surface. Besides, improved photostability of the WO3−x@TiO2−x photoanodes was also proved by a 6 hour successive PEC water splitting experiment.
Results and discussion
Fabrication and characterization of WO3−x@TiO2−x core–shell nanosheet photoanodes

Scheme 1 illustrates the synthesis protocol of the black WO3−x@TiO2−x core–shell nanosheet arrays based on the ALD process. Firstly, WO3 nanosheets were obtained on a conductive FTO glass substrate via a modified hydrothermal method.14 After annealing in air, a uniform and light yellow thin film was formed on the FTO substrate. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images in Fig. S1 of the ESI† confirm that this film with a thickness of about 2.8 μm (Fig. S1c†) is composed of vertically aligned WO3 nanosheets with a thickness of ∼23 nm (Fig. S1b†). Secondly, these WO3 nanosheets were coated conformably by amorphous TiO2 layers with different thicknesses through thermal ALD at 200 °C. After subsequent annealing in air, core–shell structured WO3@anatase-TiO2 nanosheets were obtained with a uniform thickness. The corresponding samples are denoted as W@TX in this study, where X = 0, 2.9, 5.8, 11, 15, 21 and 25, representing the thickness of the TiO2 shell layer. Typically, Fig. 1a–c show the top-view and cross-sectional SEM images of the WO3@TiO2 sample W@T15. The thicknesses of a single nanosheet and the nanosheet film are estimated to be ∼63 nm and ∼2.8 μm, respectively (Fig. 1b and c). Although a noticeable increase in the thickness of each nanosheet can be observed because of the TiO2 shell, the morphology of nanosheets remained essentially unchanged, confirming a uniform and conformal deposition process. The well-defined core–shell structure is further revealed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) characterization and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis results obtained on a typical sample W@T15 (Fig. 1d–f). The bright-field TEM and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images indicate that the shell thickness of TiO2 is around 15 nm, which is consistent with the SEM results. The EDS spectra recorded from different regions in Fig. 1d are displayed in Fig. S2,† in which the elemental W, Ti and O were clearly detected in the core, while only Ti and O can be detected in the shell. This implies that the TiO2 and the WO3 component only existed in the shell and the core region separately.

 Fig. 1  SEM and TEM characterization of the WO3@TiO2 core–shell nanosheet sample W@T15: (a) low-magnification and (b) high-magnification top-view SEM images; (c) cross-sectional-view SEM image; (d) bright-field TEM image, the model (inset) and the SAED pattern (inset) of a single core–shell nanosheet; (e) HRTEM image obtained at the core–shell interface; (f) HAADF-STEM image of a single core–shell nanosheet and the corresponding EDS line scan profiles of the Ti (red), O (blue) and W (green) elements along the orange line across the core–shell interface. 
The HRTEM image (Fig. 1e) and selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (Fig. 1d inset) of the sample W@T15 reveal that the WO3 core of the nanosheet has a single-crystal structure. The lattice fringes of 0.38 nm in the core and 0.35 nm in the shell region could be clearly identified which correspond to the d-spacing values of the (200) plane of monoclinic WO3 and the (101) plane of the anatase TiO2 phase, respectively. Fig. 1f further displays the high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) image of the sample W@T15 along with the collected elemental line scan profiles. It is obvious that the inside WO3 core looks brighter than the TiO2 shell, which could be attributed to the much larger atomic number (Z) of W (74) than Ti (22). In this regard, the core–shell structure could be identified by this distinct Z-contrast as well. Meanwhile, the elemental line scan profiles also confirm that the elemental W can be detected only in the core region. The O and Ti elements were detected in both core and shell regions while the concentration of Ti in the shell is much higher in contrast to that in the core region, which further verifies the well-defined core–shell structure of the WO3@TiO2 nanosheets.
By changing the cycle numbers of the ALD process, a series of WO3@TiO2 nanosheet samples were fabricated and denoted as W@T2.9, W@T5.8, W@T11, W@T21 and W@T25 and their corresponding overall nanosheet thicknesses are about 35, 42, 52, 74 and 86 nm (Fig. S3†). As a result, the thicknesses of TiO2 turned out to be 2.9, 5.8, 11, 15, 21 and 25 nm with different ALD cycle numbers of 50, 100, 200, 300, 400 and 500, from which the average growth rate of the TiO2 layer could be estimated to be ∼0.5 Å per cycle. This growth rate is consistent with the results from the thicknesses of the TiO2 layers grown on flat silicon wafers (Fig. S3†). The colors of these WO3@TiO2 samples evolve gradually from light yellow of pure WO3 nanosheets to light blue after the ALD reaction.
The synthesized WO3@TiO2 nanosheets were further annealed at 450 °C in a reducing H2/N2 atmosphere for 6 h to partially remove the oxygen atoms from the lattice, and the oxygen-deficient WO3−x@TiO2−x core–shell nanosheets were thereby obtained. These WO3−x@TiO2−x samples are denoted as sample rW@TX, where X = 2.9, 5.8, 11, 15, 21, and 25 and r indicates that these are reduced samples containing oxygen vacancies. The color of these nanosheet films changed to a black color after the hydrogen thermal annealing process, suggesting that the hydrogen treatment has achieved the modification of visible light absorption profiles of these samples. The SEM observation indicates that their intact core–shell nanosheet structure was retained after hydrogen treatment (Fig. 2 and S4†). From the high-magnification SEM image (Fig. 2a, inset) of the sample rW@T15, the thickness of the nanosheets is estimated to be 63 nm, which is similar to that of the parent sample W@T15 without hydrogen treatment. The TEM, HRTEM and HAADF-STEM images in Fig. 2b–d prove that the reduced sample rW@T15 retained a well-defined core–shell structure with a shell thickness of ∼15.6 nm. The distribution of W, Ti and O elements across a single WO3−x@TiO2−x nanosheet demonstrates that after thermal treatment in a hydrogen atmosphere, the WO3−x and the TiO2−x component are separately distributed in the core and shell regions in the nanosheet, respectively (Fig. 2d). The distinct lattice fringes of 0.384 and 0.35 nm identified from the core and shell regions can be assigned to the monoclinic WO3−x and anatase TiO2−x, respectively, confirming the formation of a well-defined WO3−x@TiO2−x core–shell structure. In addition, the (010) lattice fringe (0.384 nm) of WO3−x is similar to that of original WO3 (0.38 nm) shown in the HRTEM image (Fig. 1e), which is consistent with previous reports.

The crystal structures of WO3@TiO2 before and after hydrogen annealing treatment were determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD), as shown in Fig. 3a (samples W@T0, W@T15 and rW@T15) and Fig. S5.† It can be seen that the diffraction peaks of pristine WO3 nanosheets (i.e. sample W@T0) could be well indexed to a monoclinic WO3 phase (PDF#43-1035) after subtracting the background from FTO glass. Compared to the sample W@T0, the sample W@T15 obtained after 300 cycles of the ALD-TiO2 reaction displayed an extra peak at around 25°, which belongs to the anatase TiO2 phase (PDF#21-1272). Furthermore, for the WO3−x@TiO2−x core–shell nanosheet sample rW@T15 obtained after hydrogen thermal annealing at 450 °C, several characteristic diffraction peaks of WO3 disappear accompanied by the emergence of new peaks, which can be assigned to the oxygen-deficient W5O14 phase (PDF#41-0745) (Fig. 3a), suggesting the successful reduction of WO3 to WO3−x. Such an evolution of XRD patterns was also observed in other WO3−x@TiO2−x samples with different TiO2 thicknesses (Fig. S5b†). The intensity of the characteristic diffraction peak of TiO2 centered at around 25° increases as the cycle numbers of the ALD reaction increase, due to the increase of the thickness of the TiO2 layer (Fig. S5a†). It can be demonstrated that the ALD reaction can grow an extremely uniform and conformal TiO2 layer on the two-dimension nanosheet structure. However, no distinct diffraction peaks of TiO2 were detected in the XRD pattern of the sample W@T2.9, which is mainly due to the ultrathin thickness (∼2.9 nm) of the TiO2 layer obtained after only 50 cycles of the ALD-TiO2 reaction (Fig. S5a†).30

The Raman spectrum of pure WO3 nanosheets (i.e. sample W@T0) exhibits three main scattering bands located at around 272, 712 and 808 cm−1, respectively. They could be assigned to the active Raman scattering modes of monoclinic WO3.31 The Raman spectrum of the WO3@TiO2 core–shell nanosheet sample W@T15, however, displays four extra characteristic scattering bands at 143, 395, 513 and 639 cm−1, which could be attributed to the Eg, B1g, A1g + B1g and Eg modes of the anatase TiO2, respectively. Compared to the pure WO3, the WO3@TiO2 core–shell nanosheet samples (Fig. S6a†) show gradually decreased intensities of the scattering bands of monoclinic WO3 (272, 712, and 808 cm−1) as the TiO2 shell thickness increases due to the shading effect of the TiO2 shell. Besides, the anatase TiO2 (ref. 32) gets enhanced significantly. Finally, after hydrogen thermal treatment, all characteristic bands in Raman spectra of the black WO3−x@TiO2−x core–shell nanosheets become much weaker than those of original white WO3@TiO2 core–shell nanosheets (Fig. 3b, S6a and b†). This phenomenon could be explained by the local lattice imperfections due the partial removal of oxygen atoms in WO3 and TiO2 lattices. This thus confirms the effective introduction of oxygen vacancies and formation of WO3−x@TiO2−x core–shell nanosheets.33

Fig. 3c and d display the XPS spectra of the samples W@T0, rW@T0, W@T15 and rW@T15. The normalized XPS W 4f spectra (Fig. 3c) of the sample W@T0 consist two separate peaks corresponding to the characteristic W 4f5/2 and W 4f7/2 peaks for WO3, respectively. However, the normalized XPS W 4f spectra of the sample rW@T0 could be deconvoluted into two pairs of peaks corresponding to the typical binding energies of two W oxidation states, W6+ (centered at 37.7 and 35.5 eV) and W5+ (centered at 37.0 and 34.3 eV),33 respectively. Meanwhile, XPS survey spectra collected from samples W@T15 and rW@T15 are shown in Fig. 3d and S7,† where high-resolution Ti 2p and O 1s peaks expected for TiO2 could be identified for both samples. Since both the samples W@T15 and rW@T15 possessed a well-defined and uniform TiO2 shell of ∼16 nm thickness as a shelter, the component W has been covered and thus not observed. Specifically, the Ti 2p XPS spectra (Fig. S7†) of both samples show similar characteristic Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 peaks centered at 458.8 and 464.6 eV, respectively, which are also identical to the typical values of TiO2. Meanwhile, the normalized XPS O 1s spectrum of the sample rW@T15 exhibits a broader O 1s peak than the sample W@T15 (531 eV) which can be deconvoluted into two peaks centered at 530.1 and 532.1 eV, respectively (Fig. 3d). According to the previous report,28 the peak at 532.1 eV is from the Ti–OH bond in the reduced TiO2−x, which has been reported to possess about 1.5 to 1.8 eV higher binding energy than the O 1s state of the pristine TiO2. The detected hydroxyl groups on the TiO2 surface confirmed by the XPS O 1s spectrum again suggest the reduction of TiO2 shells into TiO2−x after H2 thermal treatment.
PEC performance
To evaluate the PEC performance of the prepared WO3−x@TiO2−x core–shell nanosheets, the samples before and after H2 thermal treatment with different thicknesses of the TiO2 shell were fabricated into photoanodes with an exposed area of ∼1 cm2. The current densities of all samples were measured in an aqueous solution containing 0.5 M Na2SO4 (pH = 6.8) under the irradiation of a 500 W Xe lamp (100 mW cm−2). Fig. 4a compares the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves of the pure WO3 nanosheet sample W@T0 and other WO3@TiO2 core–shell nanosheet samples in the range from −0.8 to 1.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl. The photocurrent density of the pure WO3 sample W@T0 reached 0.41 mA cm−2 at an applied bias of 0.632 V vs. Ag/AgCl (i.e. 1.23 V vs. the RHE), while other WO3@TiO2 core–shell nanosheet samples W@T2.9, W@T5.8, W@T11, W@T15, W@T21 and W@T25 all exhibit much larger photocurrent densities of about 0.52, 0.83, 1.17, 2.10, 1.16 and 1.06 mA cm−2 at the same potential, indicating that the deposition of a TiO2 shell can significantly enhance the photocurrent density. Moreover, the thickness of the TiO2 shell can affect the photoactivity of these WO3@TiO2 nanosheets as well. This remarkable increase in photocurrent density should be derived from the advantageous features offered by the well-defined and unique WO3@TiO2 core–shell heterostructure. Specifically, the photocurrent density at 1.23 V vs. the RHE kept increasing as the shell thickness of TiO2 increased gradually from 2.9 nm of W@T2.9 to 16 nm of W@T15. The sample W@T15 yielded a maximum photocurrent density of 2.10 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. the RHE. However, the photocurrent densities of the core–shell WO3@TiO2 samples decreased as the thickness of TiO2 further increased above 16 nm (i.e. samples W@T21 and W@T25). The dark current densities of all samples in this study are also recorded and provided in Fig. S8 and S9† for comparison, confirming that the photocurrent densities come essentially from the photocatalytic water splitting reaction on the photoanodes, instead of the electrocatalytic effect. Besides, it is also worth mentioning that along with the increased photocurrent densities, the onset potentials of these WO3@TiO2 core–shell nanosheet photoanodes simultaneously exhibited a remarkable shift to much more negative positions than the pure WO3 photoanode, which is favorable for developing novel tandem cells based on these WO3@TiO2 core–shell nanosheet photoanodes for overall water splitting.
 Fig. 4  (a) Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves of the photoanodes fabricated from the WO3 and WO3@TiO2 nanosheet samples W@T0, W@T2.9, W@T5.8, W@T11, W@T15, W@T21 and W@T2.90; (b) LSV curves of the photoanodes fabricated from the black WO3−x and WO3−x@TiO2−x nanosheet samples rW@T0, rW@T2.9, rW@T5.8, rW@T11, rW@T15, rW@T21 and rW@T25; (c) UV-visible steady-state DRS spectra of all the WO3, WO3@TiO2, WO3−x and WO3−x@TiO2−x nanosheet samples W@T0 to W@T25 and rW@T0 to rW@T25; (d) photocurrent density–time (J–t) curves of the photoanodes fabricated from samples W@T0, W@T15 and rW@T15 at an applied potential of 1.23 V vs. the RHE. 

Fig. 4b displays the photocurrent densities of the black WO3−x@TiO2−x core–shell nanosheet photoanodes obtained after H2 thermal annealing. It is clear that at an applied bias of 1.23 V vs. the RHE, the samples rW@T2.9, rW@T5.8, rW@T11, rW@T15, rW@T21 and rW@T25 show a photocurrent density of about 0.56, 1.09, 1.74, 3.20, 2.20 and 1.66 mA cm−2 respectively, which are at least 30% higher than those of the corresponding WO3@TiO2 core–shell nanosheet photoanodes discussed above. This improvement in photocurrent density may be related to the efficient light absorption across the whole ultraviolet and visible-light bands and also increased donor density after the transformation of these nanosheets into oxygen-deficient ones by H2 thermal treatment. It is worth noting that the black WO3−x@TiO2−x core–shell nanosheet photoanode with the shell thickness of ∼15 nm yielded the highest photocurrent (∼3.20 mA cm−2) among the WO3/TiO2 component photocatalysts reported so far. Furthermore, Fig. S10† summarizes the photocurrent densities at 1.23 V vs. the RHE of all these nanosheet photoanodes and the half-cell solar-to-hydrogen (HC-STH) conversion efficiencies achieved by the photoanodes fabricated from samples W@T0, W@T15 and rW@T15. It is amazing that the black WO3−x@TiO2−x sample rW@T15 has presented an HC-STH efficiency as high as 0.9% at an applied bias of around 0.67 V vs. the RHE (Fig. S10b†).
In order to understand and elucidate the mechanisms behind the enhanced PEC performance of the WO3@TiO2 and WO3−x@TiO2−x core–shell nanosheets, UV-visible steady-state diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) was first employed to investigate the light-absorption properties of the samples, as presented in Fig. 4c. Obviously, for the pure WO3 nanosheet sample W@T0, the absorption edge appears near the 450 nm wavelength which is consistent with the intrinsic bandgap absorption edge of WO3 (2.6 eV). After coating with TiO2 shells, the light absorption spectra of the composite samples still closely resemble that of pure WO3 with an absorption onset at around 450 nm (∼2.6 eV). Besides, an improved absorption tail in the ultraviolet light band is observed to depend on the thickness of TiO2 shells, which is attributed to the strong ultraviolet absorption of the TiO2 shell layer. Notably, the sample W@T15 possesses the strongest absorption ranging from 300 to 450 nm, which might be derived from the long path for incident light, depending on the length of the core–shell nanosheets. Moreover, the absorption in the visible light band above the 480 nm wavelength for all hydrogen thermal treated samples exhibits a significant increase comparing with that of the corresponding white WO3@TiO2 core–shell nanosheets. It is also in agreement with the apparent color changes from white yellow to black of the H2-treated samples (see the photographs of the samples before and after H2 thermal treatment in Fig. S11†).
Further, the simulations for electric-field distribution in a single nanosheet were also performed based on the FDTD method. It is noted that the bending surface of the nanosheet is ignored in the simulation to simplify the model (Fig. S12†). The thickness and height of the model for the nanosheets are roughly estimated from the SEM and TEM images shown above. The electric-field distribution pattern is simulated to study the light trapping properties of the nanosheet with and without the 16 nm TiO2 layer (i.e. samples W@T0 and W@T15) under 380 nm ultraviolet light and 500 nm visible light excitation, respectively. In particular, the electric-field (E) vectors are monitored in 3D mesh points to generate the E-field distribution maps. As a result, the normalized E-field patterns presented in Fig. 5a and b clearly demonstrate the enhanced light trapping after coating the TiO2 shell. The E-field intensity in both the core and shell regions of the WO3@TiO2 core–shell nanosheet is increased compared with those of the original WO3 nanosheets, under both 380 and 500 nm light incidence, suggesting much higher possibilities for excitation of charge carriers in both the WO3 core and the TiO2 shell across the ultraviolet to the visible light band.34 Further, since the thickness of all these WO3@TiO2 core–shell nanosheets is less than 100 nm in this work, the photogenerated holes in both the WO3 core and the TiO2 shell can readily diffuse to the outer surface of TiO2 to drive the OER. Additionally, the photogenerated charge carrier separation could benefit from this localized light absorption enhancement in the core and shell regions as well with the assistance of the localized electric force in the space charge layer.

Fig. 5c presents the charge transfer pathway in these core–shell structured WO3@TiO2 photoanodes. It is clear that photogenerated electrons and holes could be transferred from one to the other semiconductor driven by the alignment of their conduction and valence band edge positions (ECB and EVB).19 According to previous reports, the ECB and EVB values of WO3 are 0.25 V and 3.3 V while the corresponding values of TiO2 are −0.2 V and 3.2 V, respectively. The electrons would be excited upon irradiation from the valence band of both the WO3 core and the TiO2 shell to their conduction band, leaving positive holes in the valence band. The photogenerated electrons of TiO2 would be injected into the conduction band of WO3, transfer from WO3 to the FTO substrate efficiently via back contact, and finally reach the cathode. At the same time, the photogenerated holes have a higher probability of entering the valence band of TiO2 and then travelling to the surface of TiO2 shells due to the lower-lying valence states and thin thickness of TiO2. Such a favorable charge transfer behavior might lead to a remarkably inhibited charge recombination rate and higher photocurrent densities for these WO3@TiO2 core–shell nanosheet photoanodes than the pristine WO3 photoanode. However, when the thickness of the TiO2 shell increased from ∼15 nm (sample W@T15) to ∼25 nm (sample W@T25), the photocurrent density decreased from 2.10 to 1.06 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. the RHE. This lower photocurrent density of the sample W@T25 than W@T15 could be explained by the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) Nyquist plots, in which a much higher interfacial charge transfer resistance (RCT) between the WO3@TiO2 nanosheet photoanode and electrolyte is revealed (Fig. S13†).
For the reduced WO3−x@TiO2−x core–shell nanosheet samples, the photocurrent densities were further improved to a considerable extent compared with those of the original WO3@TiO2 samples, which could be ascribed to the following reasons. First, after H2 thermal treatment, the introduced oxygen vacancies in WO3−x and TiO2−x can serve as shallow electron donors which consequently lead to an enhanced donor density, and therefore promote the charge transport not only in WO3−x and TiO2−x themselves, but also at the WO3−x/FTO and WO3−x/TiO2−x interfaces. Second, the presence of the Ti3+ and W5+ self-doping effect can greatly narrow the bandgaps of WO3 and TiO2 and thus extend the visible light absorption range.25,35,36 What's more, the photogenerated charge carriers can transfer rapidly through these 2D nanosheets since the reduced WO3−x@TiO2−x core–shell samples maintained the morphology of vertically aligned nanosheet arrays. Therefore, this facilitates the charge transport as well and increases the photocurrent density finally.
Besides the photocurrent density, the stability of these WO3@TiO2 and WO3−x@TiO2−x core–shell nanosheet photoanodes was also investigated via a 6 h continuous PEC water splitting experiment. As shown in the photocurrent density–time (J–t) curves of Fig. 4d, the pure WO3 (i.e. sample W@T0) photoanode showed inferior photostability with more than 50% loss in photocurrent density at an applied bias of 1.23 V vs. the RHE after 6 h continuous illumination. Nevertheless, after coating with the TiO2 shell, the WO3@TiO2 and WO3−x@TiO2−x sample W@T15 and rW@T15 photoanodes demonstrated substantially improved photostability with less than 3% loss in photocurrent densities after the 6 h PEC water splitting reaction. Notably, the photocurrent density of the sample rW@T15 remained all the time at approximately 3.2 mA cm−2 over 6 hours without any degradation, reflecting the outstanding photostability of the black WO3−x@TiO2−x photoanodes. Particularly, Fig. S14† displays the SEM images of the sample W@T0, W@T15 and rW@T15 photoanodes after 6 h successive illumination during the stability test. As can be seen clearly, the morphology of the pure WO3 nanosheet sample W@T0 has been destroyed greatly after 6 hours, which might be the origin of the decreased photocurrent density (Fig. S14a†). In contrast, with the protection of the TiO2 or TiO2−x shell, the morphology collapse in both the core–shell structured samples W@T15 and rW@T15 can been hardly observed after the 6 h reaction (Fig. S14b and c†), which is in good agreement to the data of photocurrent densities. Besides, the superior photostability of the reduced sample rW@T15 might also be attributed to the introduction of oxygen vacancies according to previous studies.29 A comparison of the PEC performance of the photoanodes based on the WO3, TiO2, and their composites reported in recent years is also shown in Table 1. As can be seen, the photocurrent density value of typical single component photoanodes such as WO3 nanoflakes,15 WO3−x nanoflakes,37 and TiO2 nanowires25 is 1.10, 1.21, and 0.2 mA cm−2, respectively. The optimized hydrogen-treated TiO2 nanowires (TiO2−x nanowires) exhibited a maximum photocurrent density of 2.5 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. the RHE in 1 M NaOH solution (pH = 13.6).26 On the other hand, the WO3–TiO2 nanorod33 and nanotube39 photoanodes have the photocurrent density value of 0.3 and 0.7 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. the RHE, respectively. In the current work, a maximum photocurrent density value of 3.2 mA cm−2 in neutral water solutions (pH = 6.8) was achieved for the WO3−x@TiO2−x photoanodes with simultaneous excellent photostability. Furthermore, the photocurrent densities show around 3% loss even after 6 h continuous illumination. The large photocurrent and improved photostability of the WO3−x@TiO2−x photoanodes presented here are attributed to the introduction of oxygen vacancies into WO3−x and TiO2−x.

Finally, in order to determine that the reactions taking place on the nanosheet photoanode and Pt counter electrode were exactly the OER and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), the gases evolved from both electrodes were collected and quantified utilizing a gas chromatography (GC) setup. Basically, after purging the electrolyte for some time to remove the dissolved oxygen, the applied bias of the rW@T15 photoanode was held at 1.23 V vs. the RHE under the illumination of a Xe lamp (100 mW cm−2) for 2 h. As summarized in Fig. S15,† the O2 and H2 evolution rates achieved by the rW@T15 photoanode were 27 and 56 μmol h−1 cm−2, respectively, based on which the corresponding faradaic efficiency of the PEC water splitting reaction was calculated to be almost 100%. These results together suggest that the photocurrent indeed originated from the OER and HER, and hence the conversion efficiencies calculated from the photocurrent densities do represent the solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiencies of the photoanodes.
Experimental
Synthesis of WO3 nanosheets
The WO3 nanosheets were synthesized via a modified hydrothermal method reported before.14 Briefly, a seed solution containing 2.5 g of H2WO4 and 1.0 g of poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) in 34 mL of H2O2 (30 wt%) was spin-coated onto FTO substrates at 2500 rpm, followed by annealing at 500 °C in air for 2 h. Another H2WO4 solution was prepared by adding 5.0 g of H2WO4 and 68 mL of H2O2 (30 wt%) into 100 mL of H2O and stirred at 95 °C to dissolve. This H2WO4 solution was then diluted to 0.05 M for the hydrothermal process. Next, for preparing the hydrothermal precursor solution, 3 mL of the H2WO4 solution (0.05 M), 0.02 g of oxalic acid, 0.02 g of urea, 12.5 mL of acetonitrile and 0.5 mL of HCl (6.0 M) were added into a 50 mL beaker and stirred to clear. An FTO glass substrate pre-coated with the WO3 seed was then placed into a 25 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave filled with the as-prepared precursor solution, and kept at 180 °C for 2 h. Finally, the obtained sample was annealed at 500 °C in air for 2 h.
Synthesis of WO3@TiO2 core–shell nanosheets
The WO3@TiO2 core–shell nanosheets were prepared by deposition of a thin TiO2 layer on the as-prepared WO3 nanosheets in a BENEQ TFS-200 ALD system at 200 °C. Tetrakis(dimethylamido)titanium [TDMAT] and deionized (DI) water were used as the titanium (Ti) and oxidant sources, respectively. The WO3 nanosheets on the FTO substrate were alternately exposed to TDMAT and DI water in the ALD reactor chamber using high-purity argon (Ar) as both the carrier gas and purge gas. For all samples, the deposition process in each cycle briefly consists of a 0.2 s pulse of TDMAT, a 10 s purge, a 0.2 s pulse of DI water, and a 10 s purge. The different desired thicknesses were achieved by varying the number of thermal ALD cycles. Specifically during all ALD processes, the TDMAT source was held at 40 °C for evaporation. Finally, the obtained samples were calcined in air at 500 °C for 2 h with the 1 °C min−1 ramp rate.
Reduction to black WO3−x@TiO2−x core–shell nanosheets
For the preparation of oxygen-deficient black WO3−x@TiO2−x core–shell nanosheets, the as-prepared WO3@TiO2 nanosheets were annealed at 450 °C in a reductive gas (4% H2/N2) atmosphere for 6 h to partially remove the oxygen atoms from the lattice, and then cooled down to room temperature naturally.
Instruments and characterization
The thicknesses of the TiO2 films grown by ALD on Si substrates were measured using a Sopra GES-5E spectroscopic ellipsometry system (Semilab, Hungary). The TEM characterization was carried out on a FEI Tecnai G2 F20 S-TWIN field-emission TEM (United States) with the acceleration voltage of 200 kV. Both bright field and high-angle annular dark field (HAADF) imaging modes were used for the detailed structural characterization of the core–shell structures. The SEM images were recorded on a Zeiss SIGMA HD field-emission SEM (Germany) and a Hitachi S-4800 field-emission SEM (Japan). Wide-angle X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected on a Bruker D8 Advance powder X-ray diffractometer (Germany) with Ni-filtered Cu-Kα radiation (40 kV, 40 mA, and 1.5406 Å). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurement was conducted on a PHI 5000 VersaProbe system (United States) using an Mg-Kα X-ray source. The UV-visible steady-state diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) of the samples were obtained on a JASCO V-670 spectrophotometer (Japan), and the Raman spectra were measured on a Renishaw inVia-reflex laser confocal Raman micro-spectrometer (United Kingdom) equipped with a Leica DM-2500 optical microscope (Germany).
Photoelectrochemical measurements
The PEC water splitting performance of the photoanodes was measured in a three-electrode setup with the nanosheet samples as the working electrode, a Pt wire as the counter electrode, a Ag/AgCl electrode as the reference electrode, and 0.5 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution (pH = 6.8) as the electrolyte under the illumination of a 500 W Ushio Xe lamp (100 mW cm−2). The applied potential of the working electrode was controlled using a Princeton VersaSTAT-4 potentiostat (United States). The scan rate was 10 mV s−1 for the current–potential (J–E) measurement, and all scans were performed from negative to positive potentials. The electrolyte was stirred and purged with high-purity Ar gas for more than 20 minutes before each measurement. The 6 h successive photocurrent density–time (J–t) curve measurement and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurement as well as the gas collection experiment were all performed utilizing the same electrochemical measurement system at an applied potential of 1.23 V vs. the RHE. The recorded potentials vs. the Ag/AgCl electrode were converted to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) scale according to the following equation: ERHE = EAg/AgCl + 0.059 × pH + E0Ag/AgCl, where EAg/AgCl is the measured potential against the reference electrode and E0Ag/AgCl is equal to 0.1976 V at room temperature.
Conclusions
In conclusion, highly efficient and stable photoanodes based on structurally well-defined, oxygen-deficient black WO3−x@TiO2−x core–shell nanosheets with an ALD-confined shell thickness of TiO2−x have been fabricated for the first time in this study. Simultaneously enhanced light absorption across the whole ultraviolet to the visible light band, interfacial charge transfer and charge separation in these WO3−x@TiO2−x core–shell nanosheets were revealed both theoretically by finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulation and specific band alignment and experimentally by various optical and electrochemical spectroscopic characterizations. As a result, significantly improved photocurrent density, photostability and also the onset potential of the WO3−x@TiO2−x core–shell nanosheet photoanodes have been demonstrated when comparing with pristine WO3, WO3−x and WO3@TiO2 nanosheet photoanodes. Specifically, the black WO3−x@TiO2−x core–shell nanosheet photoanode with a TiO2 layer around 15 nm on WO3 achieved around 8 times higher photocurrent density (∼3.2 mA cm−2) than the pure WO3 photoanode (∼0.41 mA cm−2) at 1.23 V vs. the RHE in neutral water (pH = 6.8). In addition, unlike the original positive onset potential of the pure WO3 photoanode, a negative onset potential has also been realized after deposition of TiO2 shells on the WO3 surface. In addition, the WO3−x@TiO2−x photoanodes exhibit excellent photostability even after running a 6 h continuous PEC water splitting experiment. Based on these results, it is believed that our precisely controlled WO3−x@TiO2−x core–shell nanosheet photoanodes hold great potential for highly efficient solar-to-fuel conversion and next-generation power devices.
