    , Accepted 25th June 2014First published on 26th June 2014AbstractTwo indolo[3,2-b]carbazole and 5,6-bis(octyloxy)benzofurazan based narrow band-gap polymers PICzODTBF and PICzHDDTBF with linear and branched side chains respectively were synthesized, and their optical, electrochemical and photovoltaic properties were characterized. The number-averaged molecular weight (Mn) values of PICzODTBF and PICzHDDTBF were 8600 and 21400 with polydispersity index (PDI) values of 1.97 and 2.43, respectively. The absorption spectra for the films showed that the peaks were located at 405 and 571 nm for PICzODTBF, and 396 and 531 nm for PICzHDDTBF, accompanying optical band gaps of 1.90 and 2.05 eV, respectively. Compared with PICzHDDTBF, the absorption of PICzODTBF was obviously red shifted resulting from its linear side chains leading to better π–π stacking between polymer chains. Through the electrochemical characterization, the HOMO energy levels were found to be −5.02 and −5.28 eV, with LUMO energy levels of −3.09 and −3.08 eV for PICzODTBF and PICzHDDTBF, respectively. The photovoltaic devices were fabricated with the structure ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM/PFN/Al. For PICzODTBF, the short circuit current density (Jsc), open circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF) and power conversion efficiency (PCE) were 4.81 mA cm−2, 0.80 V, 57% and 3.23%, respectively. PICzHDDTBF had Jsc, Voc, FF and PCE values of 4.61 mA cm−2, 0.95 V, 48% and 3.13%, respectively.
Introduction
Bulk-heterojunction polymer solar cells (BHJ-PSCs) are one kind of versatile photovoltaic technology that has attracted extensive attention both academically and industrially due to their fantastic merits such as low cost, large-scale fabrication, flexibility, light weight properties and so on. Recently, high-efficiency PSCs with power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) exceeding 9% have been achieved, which are potentially applicable in electrical power generation applications.1,2
In BHJ-PSCs, electron-donating polymers are one of the most important materials. They act as an absorber of the incident sun light and a hole-transporting host.3 Until now, there have been a large amount of excellent donor polymers designed and synthesized, for instance polyfluorenes (PFs),4–6 polycarbazoles (PCzs),7–9 polythiophenes (PThs),10 polybenzodithiophenes (PBDTs)11–13 and polysilafluorenes (PSiFs).14 Some of these polymers display highly efficient photovoltaic properties when blended with fullerene derivatives as acceptor materials, such as [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM),15 indene–C60 bisadduct (ICBA)16 and [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM).1,13
Indolo[3,2-b]carbazole, due to its high thermal stability, large aromatic planarity, low band gap, high hole mobility and feasible functionalization, has been studied tremendously for organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs)17 and organic field-effect transistors (OFETs).18–20 Also, indolo[3,2-b]carbazole has been introduced as a good electron-donating unit to the polymer backbones in PSCs, where it shows that it is an advanced alternative compared to other donor moieties and gives PCEs over 3.0%.21–24 On the other hand, in order to construct narrow band-gap polymers, another co-monomer is indispensable. The structures of the mostly used co-monomers belong to the donor–acceptor–donor (D–A–D) type, for example 4,7-di(thiophen-2-yl)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (DTBT),8 3,6-di(thiophen-2-yl)pyrrolo [3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4(2H,5H)-dione (DPP),25,26 3,7-di(3-hexylthiophen-5-yl)-naphtho[1,2-c:5,6-c] bis[1,2,5]thiadiazole (DTNT),27 (E)-1,1′-bis(2-hexyldecyl)-6,6′-bis(4-octylthiophen-2-yl)-[3,3′-biindolinylidene]-2,2′-dione (Isoindigole),28 and 4,7-di(thiophen-2-yl)-2,1,3-benzo selenadiazole (DTBSe).29 4,7-Di(thiophen-2-yl)-5,6-bis(octyloxy) benzofurazan (DTOBF) is a versatile D–A–D type co-monomer and has been introduced to polymer main chains to construct outstanding donor polymers. This is ascribed to its advantageous characteristics, which include its easy synthesis, narrow band gap and high solubility; furthermore, the highly electronegative oxygen atom in benzofurazan can make the HOMO energy level lower, which is very beneficial for improving the open circuit voltage (Voc) in PSCs.7,30–32
Herein, two indolo[3,2-b]carbazole derivatives containing linear or branched side chains were synthesized. Then, two alternating polymers PICzODTBF and PICzHDDTBF were prepared by polymerizing linear chain-substituted 5,11-dioctylindolo[3,2-b]carbazole or branched chain-substituted 5,11-di(9-heptadecanyl) indolo[3,2-b]carbazole units with the DTOBF moiety. These polymers were then utilized as donor materials in BHJ-PSCs to evaluate their photovoltaic performances.
Experimental section
Characterization and instrumentation

1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and 13C NMR measurements were carried out on Bruker 300 MHz and 600 MHz DRX spectrometers with tetramethylsilane (TMS) as the internal reference. The number-average molecular weight (Mn) and weight-average molecular weight (Mw) values were determined on a Waters gel permeation chromatography (GPC) system with linear polystyrene as the standard and tetrahydrofuran (THF) as the eluent. UV-vis absorption spectra were performed on a HP 8453 spectrophotometer. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were performed on a CHI600D electrochemical workstation with a standard three electrode cell using a Pt wire counter electrode and a Pt working electrode, against a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as the reference electrode. A scan rate of 50 mV s−1 was used with a nitrogen-saturated anhydrous solution of 0.1 mol L−1 tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6) in acetonitrile, versus ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) as the internal reference.
Device fabrication
All devices were fabricated on ITO-coated glass substrates. A thin layer (40 nm) of PEDOT:PSS (Clevios 4083) was spin coated onto UV-ozone treated ITO substrates at 4000 rpm for 40 s and then baked at 140 °C for 15 min in air. The solution containing the polymer (10 mg mL−1) and fullerene (20 mg mL−1) (polymer:fullerene = 1:2, wt/wt) in o-dichlorobenzene (ODCB) was spin-coated inside a glove-box with nitrogen at 1200 rpm for 40 s to form the active layers (∼80 nm). For the device structure of ITO/PEDOT–PSS/active layer/poly[(9,9-dioctyl-2,7-fluorene)-alt-(9,9-bis(3′-(N,N-dimethyl amino)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)] (PFN)/Al, the PFN layer (5 nm) was prepared by spin casting a mixed solution (0.2 mg mL−1) with a methanol to acetic acid volume ratio of 100:1 before cathode evaporation. The aluminum cathode (80 nm) was then thermally evaporated under vacuum (∼10−6 Torr) through a shadow mask defining an active device area of 0.16 cm2. The current–voltage (J–V) curves were measured using a Keithley 2400 multimeter under AM 1.5 G solar illumination at 87 mW cm−2 and a Thermal-Oriel 150 W solar simulator. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) values were obtained with a monochromator and calibrated with a silicon photodiode. Hole mobility data of the neat polymers were measured by the space charge limited current (SCLC) method with a device configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS(40 nm)/active layer(150 nm for PICzODTBF and 66 nm for PICzHDDTBF)/MoO3(10 nm)/Al(90 nm). Preliminarily, PEDOT:PSS was spin cast on the ITO coated glass substrate, then, the active layers were prepared from the ODCB solution with a 1% concentration by spin coating. Finally, the MoO3 and Al layers were deposited by thermal evaporation under high vacuum.

Results and discussion
Synthesis
The detailed synthetic routes are displayed in Scheme 1. The monomer 3,9-bis(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)-5,11-dioctylindolo[3,2-b]carbazole 3 was synthesized by a Suzuki coupling reaction in the presence of bis(pinacolato)diboron due to the very low solubility of 3,9-dibromo-5,11-dioctylindolo[3,2-b]carbazole 2 at low temperatures, which is a problem if prepared by the alternative BuLi reaction. PICzODTBF and PICzHDDTBF were synthesized by Suzuki polycondensation reactions in toluene, and purified by Soxhlet extractions in methanol, acetone, hexane and chloroform for 12 h each. Precipitation was then induced using methanol, and the solid was dried at 60 °C under vacuum for 12 h. The solubility of the polymers was good in common organic solvents (such as tetrahydrofuran, chloroform, chlorobenzene and dichlorobenzene). The gel permeation chromatography (GPC) characterization showed that the number-averaged molecular weight (Mn) and polydispersity index (PDI) values were 8600 and 1.97, and 21400 and 2.43 for PICzODTBF and PICzHDDTBF, respectively (see Table 1). Compared with PICzHDDTBF, PICzODTBF had a lower molecular weight, which is possibly because the two linear octyl side chains and the large planarity in the indolo[3,2-b]carbazole units limit the polymer's solubility during the polymerization and ultimately inhibit the increment of the molecular weight. However, PICzHDDTBF contains two branched heptadecanyl side chains in each indolo[3,2-b]carbazole unit, which enhance its solubility dramatically and improve the molecular weight.

Thermal stability
The thermal stability of polymers is a very indispensable parameter for estimating the performance of BHJ-PSCs. The temperatures at 5% weight loss in the thermal gravimetric analyses (see Fig. 1) of PICzODTBF and PICzHDDTBF were 324 and 333 °C respectively (see Table 1), which indicate that these two polymers have good thermal stabilities.
 Fig. 1  Thermal gravimetric analysis curves for PICzODTBF and PICzHDDTBF. 
Absorption and electrochemical analysis
The UV-vis absorption spectra of the polymers in chloroform and in films are shown in Fig. 2a. Each of the two polymers had two distinct absorption peaks both in solution and in the films. One of the peaks was located at around 400 nm due to the localized π–π* transition. The other peak was at longer wavelengths, ranging from about 530 to 570 nm, and is attributed to the internal charge transfer interaction between the donor and acceptor units (see Table 2). Compared to PICzHDDTBF, PICzODTBF exhibits an obvious large red shift in the film compared to in chloroform; the peaks are shifted from 398 and 535 nm in chloroform to 405 and 571 nm in the film. This large red shift for PICzODTBF is possibly ascribed to its better intermolecular π–π stacking resulting from its more linear side chains compared to the branched heptadecanyl side chains in PICzHDDTBF. The onsets of the absorption spectra of PICzODTBF and PICzHDDTBF in the films were 654 and 606 nm, which correspond to optical band gaps of 1.90 and 2.05 eV, respectively.

The cyclic voltammogram (CV) characterization in Fig. 2b presents the reversible oxidative and reductive curves, in which the onsets of the oxidation and reduction potentials for PICzODTBF and PICzHDDTBF are located at 0.42 and −1.51, and 0.68 and −1.52 V versus SCE, respectively. The redox potential of the Fc/Fc+ internal reference was 0.2 V vs. SCE. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of PICzODTBF and PICzHDDTBF, determined by calculating from the empirical formula EHOMO = −e(Eox + 4.8 − E1/2,(Fc/Fc+)) and ELUMO = −e(Ere + 4.8 − E1/2,(Fc/Fc+)), were found to be −5.02 and −3.09, and −5.28 and −3.08 eV, respectively. The higher HOMO energy level of PICzODTBF compared to PICzHDDTBF is possibly ascribed to the compact configuration in PICzODTBF with substituted straight side chains in the indolocarbazole segments.33,34 The energy band gaps of PICzODTBF and PICzHDDTBF, calculated from CV data, were 1.93 and 2.20 eV, respectively, which are approximately the same as the optical band gaps (see Table 2).
Hole mobility
The hole mobilities of the neat polymers were measured by the space charge limited current (SCLC) method with a device configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/MoO3/Al. Fig. 3 shows the J–V curves of the neat polymer films from the SCLC devices. The hole mobilities of PICzODTBF and PICzHDDTBF were found to be 2.4 × 10−4 and 2.7 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. In contrast with PICzHDDTBF, PICzODTBF has higher hole mobility, which is possibly because of its better intermolecular π–π stacking resulting from its more linear side chains compared to the branched side chains in PICzHDDTBF, and ultimately, this strong stacking effect can strengthen the hole transporting ability between polymer chains.

Photovoltaic properties
PSCs were fabricated with a device architecture of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM/(PFN)/Al. Here, PC71BM was selected as the acceptor material due to its good light absorption properties in the visible region, and PFN was utilized as a cathode interfacial layer due to its versatile functions in protecting the active layer during cathode evaporation and possibly existing as built-in electric fields between the active layer and cathode.35,36 The current density–voltage (J–V) curves are shown in Fig. 4a. It shows that PICzODTBF based PSCs have a larger short circuit current density (Jsc), which is possibly due to its better light absorption properties compared to PICzHDDTBF. On the other hand, PICzHDDTBF based PSCs have a higher open circuit voltage (Voc) compared to PICzODTBF based PSCs. This is possibly because PICzHDDTBF has a lower HOMO energy level compared to PICzODTBF, where the value of Voc is proportional to the energy level difference between the HOMO energy level of the donor and the LUMO energy level of the acceptor.37 Furthermore, by inserting PFN as the cathode interfacial layer, the Voc and fill factor (FF) values are enhanced distinctly, and therefore resulting in enhanced PCEs. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) curves of the PSCs are shown in Fig. 4b. The IPCEs of the PCEs which use PFN as a cathode interfacial layer are similar to the ones without the PFN layer. In comparison to PICzHDDTBF based PSCs, the PICzODTBF based ones have broadened and enhanced IPCE values in the visible region due to its intensified and broadened light absorption properties.

The photovoltaic performances in detail under AM 1.5 G, 87 mW cm−2 are summarized in Table 3. The data shows that PICzHDDTBF based solar cells had higher Voc values, where the highest Voc value reached 0.95 V. Nevertheless, the PICzODTBF based PSCs had higher Jsc values up to 4.89 mA cm−2 and higher FF values upto 57%. Ultimately, both the PICzODTBF and PICzHDDTBF based photovoltaic devices exhibited similar PCEs of 3.23% and 3.13%, respectively.

AFM morphology
AFM images of the blend films are shown in Fig. 5. In the topographies shown in Fig. 5a and b, the root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of the PICzODTBF and PICzHDDTBF based blend films are 1.659 and 4.348 nm respectively, which means that the PICzHDDTBF:PC71BM film was rougher than the PICzODTBF based one. Moreover, the phase images (Fig. 5c and d) showed that the PICzODTBF:PC71BM film gave a better nano-scale phase separation,38 while the PICzHDDTBF based one showed worse phase separation and formed small islands that would negatively affect the holes and electrons transportation and ultimately affect the photovoltaic properties. Also, according to the photovoltaic performances in Table 3, the PICzODTBF based PSCs exhibited higher FF values due to the better nano-scale phase separation in the PICzODTBF:PC71BM blend films.

Conclusions
In summary, two indolo[3,2-b]carbazole derived narrow band-gap polymers PICzODTBF and PICzHDDTBF with different side chains were designed and prepared by Suzuki polycondensation reactions. The PICzODTBF polymer with linear chains showed higher Jsc values than the PICzHDDTBF polymer due to its better light absorption properties, which result from better intermolecular π–π stacking between polymer chains. However, the branched side chain polymer PICzHDDTBF exhibited higher Voc values due to its lower HOMO energy level. Therefore, side chain engineering to tune energy levels and band gaps of conjugated polymers is a feasible method. Moreover, these results suggest that indolo[3,2-b]carbazole is possibly a potential candidate for designing and synthesizing narrow band-gap polymeric donors for highly efficient PSCs.
