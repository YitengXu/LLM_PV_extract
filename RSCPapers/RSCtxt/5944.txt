    , Accepted 12th November 2014First published on 12th November 2014AbstractNovel photosensitizers (PSs) with formyl bipyridyl ligands in different positions were developed to improve the electron transfer from an iridium complex PS to a colloidal platinum catalyst, resulting in much higher turnover numbers than the non-formyl bipyridyl Ir-PS in photocatalytic hydrogen generation.
Hydrogen is a clean energy source that could be used in a vast variety of applications including powering electronic devices, fuel cells, vehicles, and homes.1–6 So far, various approaches and/or catalysts have been developed to produce hydrogen efficiently and in an environmentally friendly manner.7–9 Recently, photocatalytic hydrogen generation using solar energy has been under intense investigation,10 and promising approaches have been reported by using an inorganic semiconductor11 and a molecular transition-metal complex as photocatalysts.12 A key challenge in photocatalysis is the design of efficient photosensitizers (PSs) that absorb visible light leading to charge-separated and long-lived excited states. Iridium complexes, particularly those with a general formula [Ir(C^N)2(N^N)]+ (C^N stands for the cyclometalating ligand and N^N for the bipyridyl ligand), have been explored as active PSs.13 To better understand hydrogen generation from photoinduced water splitting with the aid of PSs, a three-component system focusing only on the hydrogen-generation half reaction is illustrated in Fig. S1a (ESI†), which includes the Ir-PS, a sacrificial electron donor (e.g., triethylamine (TEA)), and a catalyst (e.g., colloidal platinum). Under a reductive quenching process the excited state (Ir-PS*) is reduced by TEA to form Ir-PS−, which is then able to transfer an electron to Pt to drive hydrogen generation through water reduction.14–16 Interestingly, in this heteroleptic Ir(III) structure [Ir(C^N)2(N^N)]+, the highest occupied molecular orbitals and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals are spatially separated, located predominately on the Ir(III) metal and C^N ligands, and the N^N bipyridyl ligands, respectively.13 In this regard, the cyclometalating ligand has a critical effect on the electron transfer from TEA to the Ir-PS*, while the bipyridyl ligand determines the electron transfer from Ir-PS− to the Pt catalyst. As the major degradation of the Ir-PS comes from the cleavage of the bipyridyl ligand in the reduced state (Ir-PS−),15,16 it is of great importance to quench promptly the Ir-PS− by transferring its electron swiftly to the Pt catalyst in order to achieve long stability.
Therefore, researchers are particularly interested in the modification of the bipyridyl ligand in order to improve the interaction between the Ir-PS and the Pt catalyst. For this purpose, Bernhard et al. reported approaches using vinyl (–CHCH2)15 and pyridyl16 functional moieties to make Ir-PS molecules adsorb on the surface of the Pt catalyst (Fig. S1b, ESI†) for fast electron transfer, which is definitely more desirable compared with the case that Ir-PS molecules diffuse freely in the bulk solution. It is also known in nature photosynthesis that chlorophyll pigments including chlorophyll b and d embrace a feature group, formyl (–CHO), which is important to tune the molecular electronic properties and orchestrate the interaction between chlorophyll and other biological co-factors.17 Inspired by this concept, we report herein for the first time the synthesis of Ir-PSs with formyl bipyridyl ligands, 4-FlCHO-Ir and 3-PhCHO-Ir (Fig. 1), and their application in photocatalytic hydrogen-generation reactions. For comparison, a model compound 4-Me-Ir (Fig. S2, ESI†)14,18 without formyl functions was also employed. Interestingly and significantly, this simple structural modification leads to a drastic improvement in turnover numbers (TONs) of photocatalytic hydrogen generation through water reduction.
 Fig. 1  Synthesis scheme of new Ir-PSs, 4-FICHO-Ir and 3-PhCHO-Ir. 
As shown in Fig. 1, two new formyl bipyridyl ligands were synthesized by a Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling reaction19 using the respective bromopyridine and formyl aryl boronate.20 The two new Ir-PSs were then synthesized in a straightforward manner by the reaction of [Ir(ppy)2]2Cl2 (ppy = phenylpyridine)21 with the respective bipyridyl ligand in a mixture of CH2Cl2–CH3OH at reflux and followed by anion exchange with KPF6.
For a successful application of the synthesized iridium complexes as PSs, various criteria have to be fulfilled. In addition to the prerequisite light absorption, the formed excited state (Ir-PS*) should survive as long as effective electron transfer from the electron donor to Ir-PS*. Moreover, the reduced species (Ir-PS−) has to possess a sufficient reduction potential to transfer an electron to the Pt catalyst. Therefore, the new Ir-PSs were fully characterized by photophysics and electrochemistry.

Fig. 2 shows the electronic absorption spectra of the various Ir-PSs, while the derived photophysical parameters are summarized in Table 1. All the complexes show strong absorption in the UV region (Fig. 2a) and moderate absorption in the visible region (Fig. 2b), with an absorption threshold at ∼550 nm. Due to the increased π-conjugation of the formyl bipyridyl ligand, the corresponding formyl Ir-PSs, 4-FlCHO-Ir and 3-PhCHO-Ir, show higher absorption intensity than 4-Me-Ir. As expected, they also exhibit red-shifted emission peaks (λem = 606 and 611 nm for 4-FlCHO-Ir and 3-PhCHO-Ir, respectively, as shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†) and in Table 1) compared with 4-Me-Ir (λem = 574 nm), due to electron withdrawal by the –CHO group. Most interestingly, even though relatively short excited-state lifetimes (τ) for both formyl compounds and a lower photoluminescence quantum yield (φPL) for 3-PhCHO-Ir were observed, they still demonstrate better photocatalytic performance than 4-Me-Ir. The details can be seen later.

Table 1 also summarizes the electrochemical reduction [E(PS/PS−)] and oxidation potentials [E(PS+/PS)] derived from the CV plots of the various Ir-PSs (Fig. S4, ESI†). For thermodynamically allowed electron transfer from Ir-PS− to Pt, E(PS/PS−) has to be more negative than the proton reduction potential (e.g., −0.71 V vs. NHE at pH = 12). The attachment of –CHO groups gives lower reduction potentials of the Ir-PSs, i.e., −0.89 V and −0.81 V for 4-FlCHO-Ir and 3-PhCHO-Ir, respectively. However they are still sufficient to drive the electron transfer, as confirmed from their high turnover frequencies in H2-generation reactions (not shown). Furthermore, for the effective reduction of Ir-PS* by TEA, the excited-state reduction potential, E(PS*/PS−), has to be higher than E(TEA+/TEA) (i.e., +0.93 V vs. NHE).22 Interestingly, the E(PS*/PS−) values for the formyl Ir-PSs are 0.1–0.2 V higher than that of 4-Me-Ir, which is likely to benefit the reduction of Ir-PS* by TEA.
The photophysical and electrochemical results of the formyl Ir-PSs suggest that they are possibly active as PSs for photocatalytic hydrogen generation from water. Therefore, their activities were assessed by using reaction mixtures containing 0.5 μmol of Ir-PS, 0.30 μmol of K2PtCl4, 2 mL of TEA, 2 mL of H2O, and 6 mL of THF.15 The colloidal Pt catalyst can be formed in situ from K2PtCl4 under light illumination.13 The reaction mixtures were placed in sealed flasks and light-soaked by a 150 W Xeon lamp. The evolved hydrogen gas was collected and analyzed by GC.

Fig. 3 shows the representative kinetic traces of hydrogen generation, with the final TONs summarized in Table 1. For the reference Ir-PS (4-Me-Ir) without the –CHO group, an average TON of 1432 is obtained. Another non-formyl model compound with a fluorene pendant on the bipyridyl ligand, 4-Fl-Ir (Fig. S2, ESI†), shows a slightly higher TON of 1735 (Table S1, ESI†), which can be attributed to the increased absorption from the fluorene moiety. Interestingly, with formyl Ir-PSs, the H2-generation capability is considerably enhanced, corresponding to average TONs of 6364 and 3603 for 4-FlCHO-Ir and 3-PhCHO-Ir, respectively. The improvement in TONs is clearly ascribed to the enhanced stability. As can be seen from the kinetic traces in Fig. 3, the hydrogen-generation duration for 4-Me-Ir is ca. 1 h under the test conditions, while those for 3-PhCHO-Ir and 4-FlCHO-Ir increase to 2 and 5 h, respectively.
 Fig. 3  Kinetic traces of H2-generation photoreactions for different Ir-PSs. The reaction mixtures contained 0.5 μmol of Ir-PS, 0.30 μmol of K2PtCl4, 2 mL of TEA, 2 mL of H2O, and 6 mL of THF, TON = n(H)/n(PS). 
The extended hydrogen-generation duration by the introduction of –CHO groups is very similar to the previous reports using vinyl (–CHCH2) Ir-PSs with an orchestrated Ir-PS/Pt self-assembled structure (Fig. S1b, ESI†).15 The formyl Ir-PS molecules are also likely to adsorb on the Pt surface via –CHO reduced derivatives.23 This is proved by an analysis of controlled reaction residues. With a mixture of 0.1 μmol of Ir-PS and 0.50 μmol of K2PtCl4 in TEA/H2O/THF (2 mL/2 mL/6 mL), the residues after 1 h hydrogen-generation reactions were filtered through a syringe filter with 0.2 μm pore size, and then the filtrates were analyzed using both a UV-visible spectrometer and an ESI-MS. As shown in Fig. S5 and S6 (ESI†), clear absorption and ESI-MS peaks of iridium compounds were found from the 4-Me-Ir filtrate, while they were not found from the formyl Ir-PSs' filtrates. The results indicate that the formyl Ir-PS derivatives mostly anchor on the colloidal Pt surface and form strong interactions. This will help the Ir-PS molecules assemble on the nano-Pt, facilitating electron transfer from Ir-PS− to Pt. The fast quenching of Ir-PS− provides Ir-PSs less opportunity to dissociate and thus become relatively stable. So far the attempts of in situ characterization of the residues in order to recognize the formyl Ir-PS derivatives have not succeeded, due to the essentially low concentration of Ir-PSs in the reaction mixture. The formation of –CH2OH derivatives from –CHO reduction has not been observed from the filtrate absorption and MS results.

Fig. 3 also exhibits a nearly doubled TON of 4-FlCHO-Ir with respect to 3-PhCHO-Ir, implying that the fine-tuning of the molecular structure is also critical. It is noted that the better light absorption of 4-FlCHO-Ir than 3-PhCHO-Ir is advantageous in sensitizing the photocatalytic reactions. This can be confirmed from the higher incident photon to hydrogen conversion efficiency (IPCE) (Fig. S7, ESI†) of the former Ir-PS, especially that in the wavelength region close to 550 nm. In addition, from the view of the molecular structure, the electron transfer from the para-position of the bipyridyl ligand is more favourable than that from the meta-position, which is also a possible explanation as to why 4-FlCHO-Ir is superior to 3-PhCHO-Ir in terms of its extended stability in hydrogen-generation reactions (Fig. 3).
In summary, two new Ir-PSs with –CHO groups on the bipyridyl ligand were synthesized. They are proven to be more stable than non-formyl Ir-PSs in photocatalytic H2 generation when a three-component system containing a triethylamine electron donor and a colloidal platinum catalyst is employed. The fine structural control is also critical from the comparison of 4-FlCHO-Ir and 3-PhCHO-Ir. The role of –CHO is likely to improve the interaction between Ir-PS and Pt and thus form a favourable self-assembled Ir-PSs/Pt nanostructure, although a detailed study needs to be carried out in the future to explain this phenomenon and design new strategies for developing innovative photocatalytic compounds.
