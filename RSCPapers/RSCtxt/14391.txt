Fused coplanar porphyrin oligomers, represented by meso–meso, β–β, β–β triply linked porphyrin arrays (porphyrin tapes), are endued with more red-shifted absorption spectra and better nonlinear optical properties. These fused porphyrinoids have emerged as promising near-infrared (NIR) absorbing dyes, pointing to future applications such as conducting wire, NIR emitter, photovoltaics, and nonlinear optical materials. Developments of the fused porphyrinoid chemistry are reviewed in this feature article with focus on the synthesis, the relationships between their absorption spectra and molecular structures, and the applications in materials science.Hirotaka MoriHirotaka Mori was born in 1988 in Chiba, Japan. He received his BSc degree from Kyoto University in 2011 under the supervision of Prof. A. Osuka. He is currently a second-year graduate student in the group of Prof. Osuka.Takayuki TanakaTakayuki Tanaka was born in 1984 in Osaka, Japan. He received his BSc (2007), MSc (2009), and PhD (2012) degrees from Kyoto University. He was selected as a JSPS Research Fellow for Young Scientists in 2009. He is currently working with Prof. Dr Lawrence T. Scott's group at Boston College as a JSPS Postdoctoral Fellow for Research Abroad.Atsuhiro OsukaAtsuhiro Osuka received a PhD from Kyoto University in 1982. In 1979, he started his academic carrier at Ehime University as an Assistant Professor. In 1984, he came back to Kyoto University, where he has been a Professor since 1996. His research interests cover many aspects of synthetic approaches toward novel porphyrin-related compounds with intriguing structures, properties, and functions, which were recognized with the Chemical Society of Japan Award in 2010. Representative molecules explored in his laboratory include artificial photosynthetic reaction center models, meso–meso-linked porphyrin arrays, porphyrin tapes, expanded porphyrins, subporphyrins, and Möbius aromatic and antiaromatic molecules.I IntroductionPorphyrin is a square planar macrocycle consisting of four pyrroles and four methine carbons, along which an 18π-electronic conjugated network can be delineated. Porphyrin is thus one of the typical aromatic molecules, as indicated by its strong diatropic ring current. Porphyrin displays high absorbance in the visible region owing to a Soret band around 400 nm and Q-bands around 500–600 nm. Natural photosynthetic pigments such as chlorophylls and bacteriochlorophylls are also 18π aromatic macrocycles, absorbing light in more red regions up to around 660 and 770 nm, respectively. These pigments have been extensively studied in order to understand their roles in photosynthesis. With these backgrounds, both natural and artificial porphyrinic pigments have been extensively examined in diverse fields including artificial photosynthesis, oxidation catalysts, oxygen-reducing catalysts, molecular recognition, and materials science.1Recent studies revealed that the electronic properties of porphyrins were quite flexible and strongly perturbed by conjugative peripheral modifications. Among such modifications, the peripheral fusion reactions are quite effective for electronic perturbations and hence the reactions realise large red-shift of the absorption spectra; the Q-bands are indeed shifted to the NIR region in some cases. Not only the absorption spectra but also the nonlinear optical properties for fused porphyrinoids are largely perturbed. Typically, the two-photon absorption (TPA) cross-sections are distinctly enhanced. Naturally, the recent demand for NIR dyes has driven the synthetic chemistry of fused porphyrinoids at a remarkable rate, pointing potential applications in NIR electroluminescence displays, nonlinear optical materials, photodynamic therapy, and molecular electronics.2–11 In this feature article, the developments of fused porphyrinoids are reviewed with focus on the synthesis, the relationships between their absorption spectra and molecular structures, and the applications in materials science. From a structural viewpoint, fused porphyrins are classified into (a) β,β fusion type, (b) meso-Ar,β fusion type, (c) meso,β fusion type, and (d) β,meso,β fusion type (Fig. 1). Although the fusion type largely influences the electronic perturbation in the fused porphyrins, the entity and number of fused aromatic segments and the central metal in the porphyrin cavity are also important. Fig. 1  Fusion types of porphyrin. II Porphyrins fused to aromatic hydrocarbons and heterocyclesFusing an aromatic hydrocarbon or aromatic heterocycle directly onto the porphyrin periphery is an effective means to expand the π-conjugated electronic network of porphyrins. Fusion reaction provides covalent connection between the porphyrin and the aromatic segment and, at the same time, forces a coplanar conformation of the porphyrin and fused aromatic segment, which assures the increased electronic interactions better than those in singly linked precursors.(i) β,β Arene-fused porphyrinsA simple example of β,β arene-fused porphyrins is tetrabenzoporphyrin 1, in which four benzene rings are directly fused onto all the β-positions.12,13 While there are so many examples of β,β arene-fused porphyrins covering mono-fused, di-fused, tri-fused, and tetra-fused ones, only tetraarene-fused examples are taken up in this review due to the limited space. Thus, β,β arene-fused porphyrins synthesised by Diels–Alder reaction and 1,3-dipolar cycloadditions6 are not taken up here. Tetrabenzoporphyrin 1 was first prepared in ca. 30% yield by zinc ion templated condensation of isoindolinone-3-acetic acid at 350 °C (Fig. 2).12,14 Fig. 2  β,β Arene-fused porphyrins. A more convenient synthetic route has been developed by using arene-annulated pyrroles prepared by Barton–Zard reactions of nitroaromatic compounds with isocyanoacetates.15 This chemistry has been mainly developed by Lash et al.16,17 and Ono et al.18,19 independently. As a typical example, synthesis of tetraphenanthroporphyrin 6 is shown in Scheme 1. Barton–Zard reaction of 9-nitrophenanthrene 8 with ethyl isocyanoacetate gave phenanthropyrrole 9 in 78% yield. The ester group of 9 was reduced with LiAlH4 to corresponding alcohol 10, which was in turn tetramerised with BF3·OEt2 in CH2Cl2 followed by the oxidation with 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyanobenzoquinone (DDQ) to provide 6 in 13% yield.20 Scheme 1  Synthesis of 9,10-phenanthrene-fused porphyrin 6. Oxidative aromatisation routes to these tetrabenzoporphyrins and tetranaphthoporphyrins were developed by Vinogradov et al. (Scheme 2).21–25 Pyrroles 11 carrying a fused cyclohexane ring were prepared by Barton–Zard reaction and subsequent decarboethoxylation, and then pyrroles were condensed to give porphyrins 12, which were oxidatively aromatised to fused porphyrins 13. The phosphorescence quantum yields of these Pd(II) and Pt(II) complexes were reported to reach as high as 20–50%. Taking advantage of these phosphorescence properties, these complexes were proposed to serve as a tunable phosphorescent NIR oxygen indicator.26 Scheme 2  Synthesis of β,β arene-fused porphyrins via the oxidative aromatisation strategy. Ono et al. developed a smart retro-Diels–Alder strategy, in which β,β arene-fused porphyrins were produced by retro-Diels–Alder reactions of soluble bicyclo[2.2.2]octadiene-fused precursors.27,28 Synthesis of tetrabenzoporphyrin 1 is shown in Scheme 3. Barton–Zard reaction of β-nitro sulfone 14 with ethyl isocyanoacetate gave ethyl 4,7-dihydro-4,7-ethano-2H-isoindole-1-carboxylate 15, which was reduced by LiAlH4 to the corresponding alcohol 16. The alcohol 16 was condensed with p-TsOH and subsequently oxidised to porphyrin 17 in ca. 30% yield. Upon heating at 200 °C, 17 was converted to 1 in 100% yield. Remarkably, the retro-Diels–Alder reactions proceeded quantitatively. While tetrabenzoporphyrin 1 is an extended planar molecule and is only poorly soluble in common organic solvents, its precursor 17 is quite soluble in many organic solvents and can be strictly purified (>99.9%) through silica-gel chromatography. In addition, 17 formed a homogeneous spin-coat film, which was converted to a film of 1 by simple heating at 210 °C through the retro-Diels–Alder reaction. Organic field-effect transistor (OFET) performance of this film recorded: mobility μ = 0.017 cm−2 V−1 s−1, threshold voltage Vth = −0.3 V and ION/IOFF = 1 × 105.28–30 This intriguing chemistry was recently used for the organic photovoltaic device based on a solution-processable three-layer p-i-n structure that displayed 5.2% power-conversion efficiency (PCE).29 Scheme 3  Synthesis of tetrabenzoporphyrin 1via the retro-Diels–Alder strategy. Tetranaphthoporphyrins 425,30,31 and tetraanthroporphyrins 732,33 were also prepared by the retro-Diels–Alder strategy, which showed the Q-bands around 773 nm and 800 nm, respectively. While 4 is relatively stable in solution under air, 7 is rather unstable, probably due to facile oxidative degradation. Nevertheless, the Pd(II) complex 20, which was prepared by the oxidative aromatisation method (Scheme 4), was used for up-conversion on the basis of energetically conjoined triplet–triplet annihilation. Namely, the excitation at λ = 790 nm (full-width at half maximum; fwhm ∼ 23 nm) of a solution of 20 and rubrene (emitter) resulted in the fluorescence at 570 nm (fwhm ∼ 65 nm).33 Scheme 4  Synthesis of tetraanthroporphyrin Pd(II) complex 20. BODIPY-appended benzoporphyrin platinum complex 23 was prepared by the oxidative aromatisation method (Scheme 5) and was shown to exhibit efficient NIR phosphorescence (λem = 772 nm, Φp = 0.26) from a long-lived equilibrated state, 3(BODIPY)*-Por ⇄ BODIPY-3(Por)*, that was formed via complex intramolecular excitation energy transfer reactions.34 Scheme 5  Synthesis of BODIPY-appended benzoporphyrin Pt(II) complex 23. A new synthetic method of benzoporphyrins was reported, in which 2,3,12,13-tetrabromoporphyrin 24 reacted with an excess amount of methyl acrylate in the presence of the in situ generated Pd(0) catalyst at 128 °C for three days under a strictly inert atmosphere to produce opp-dibenzoporphyrin 26 (λmax = 611 nm in CH2Cl2) probably via intermediate 25 (Scheme 6).35 Interestingly, the oxidative aromatisation proceeded in one-pot. This approach was extended to the synthesis of triphenylene-fused porphyrin 29 (λmax = 587 nm in CH2Cl2) and dibenzo[fg,op]tetracence-fused porphyrin 30 (λmax = 613 nm in CH2Cl2) (Scheme 7).36opp-Dibenzoporphyrins have been examined as a pigment in a dye-sensitised solar cell, recording the device performance in the range of 1.54–3.14%.37 Scheme 6  Synthetic approach to β,β-fused porphyrin via Heck-type coupling.  Scheme 7  Synthesis of triphenylene-fused porphyrin 29 and dibenzo[fg,op]tetracence-fused porphyrin 30. Naphthoquinone-fused porphyrins 32–36 were prepared by Kräutler et al. through the thermal reaction of a β,β′-tetrasulfonenoporphyrin with 1,4-benzoquinone (Scheme 8). These fused porphyrins were called “black porphyrins” since they absorb light in the visible range with substantial absorbance.38 Scheme 8  Synthesis of “black porphyrins”. Barton–Zard reaction was applied to 2-nitro-tetraphenyl Ni(II) porphyrin 37. Namely, the reaction of 37 with ethyl isocyanoacetate in a 10:1 mixture of THF–isopropyl alcohol using DBU as a base afforded fused pyrroloporphyrin 39 (λmax = 604 nm in CH2Cl2) in 40% yield.39 Similar Barton–Zard reaction of 38 gave fused pyrroloporphyrin Cu(II) complex 40, which was regioselectively formylated at the α-position of the pyrrole with CH(OMe)3 and TFA to give formylated product 41. Condensation of 41 with 2,4-dimethylpyrrole followed by treatment with BF3·OEt2 and TEA gave BODIPY-fused Cu(II) porphyrin 42 (λmax = 675 nm in CH2Cl2) (Scheme 9).40 Scheme 9  Synthesis of pyrroloporphyrin 39 and 40, and BODIPY-fused porphyrin 42. Although there have been many reports on metallocene-appended porphyrins at meso-position, directly metallocene-fused porphyrins still remain quite rare. In 2001, Smith and co-workers reported β,β′-ruthenocene-fused porphyrin 44 and ferrocenoporphyrin dimer 45 from cyclopentadiene-fused porphyrin 43 as a key precursor. 43 was prepared from in situ generated Pd(0) catalysed [3 + 2] cycloaddition of 37 with 2-[(trimethylsilyl)methyl]-2-propen-1-yl acetate followed by thermal elimination of nitrous acid and acid-catalysed double bond migration (Scheme 10).41 Scheme 10  Synthesis of metallocene-fused porphyrins. Bergman cyclisation of β,β′-diethynylporphyrin 46 was reported by Smith et al. in 2001.42 Under these conditions (5% 1,4-cyclohexadiene in chlorobenzene at 190 °C), an unexpected tandem radical cyclisation with the adjacent meso-phenyl groups proceeded, giving picenoporphyrin 48 in 89% yield (λmax = 629 nm in CH2Cl2). Extension of this strategy to porphyrinic enediyne 49 afforded 50 (λmax = 660 nm in CH2Cl2) in 92% yield.43 Although harsh conditions were necessary in the initial cases, Zaleski et al. reported that the addition of DDQ as a hydrogen atom acceptor accelerated the Bergman cyclisation under the milder conditions (stirring for 30 min at room-temperature).44 The dependence of the cyclisation on the alkyne terminal group as well as the photo-induced cyclisation was carefully studied.45,46 Later, the same group reported that the heating of 46 in the presence of PtCl2 in toluene at 85–90 °C gave a different fused product 47 (λmax = 610 nm in CH2Cl2) in 35–48% yield (Scheme 11).47,48 Scheme 11  Bergman-type cyclisation of enediyne porphyrins. Richeter et al. attempted the synthesis of N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC)-fused porphyrins by following the reaction route shown in Scheme 12. Tetrakis(4-tert-butylphenyl) Ni(II) porphyrin 51 was nitrated with LiNO3 in a mixture of acetic acid and acetic anhydride to afford 52, which was reacted with 4-amino-4H-1,2,4-triazole to give 53. Subsequent reduction of 53 with NaBH4 and Pd/C followed by condensation with HC(OMe)3 furnished imidazole-fused Ni(II) porphyrin 54, which was converted to the corresponding free base 55, Zn(II) porphyrin 56 and Cu(II) porphyrin 57, and then to imidazolium salts 59, 60, 61 and 62, respectively. These salts were used for the construction of externally metalated complexes such as Rh(I) complex 63 and Pd(II) bridged dimer 64.49–51 These molecules may find applications as a tunable reaction catalyst. They also reported more fusion of imidazole groups onto the peripheral β-positions, and finally succeeded in the full fusion of four imidazole rings to give 58, which is expected as a key precursor of square grid polymeric network materials.52 Scheme 12  Synthesis of imidazole-fused porphyrins and their NHC-type peripheral metal complexes. (ii) meso,β Arene-fused porphyrinsAs in earlier examples, meso-(formylvinyl) Ni(II) porphyrin 65 was treated with strong acids such as concentrated sulfuric acid to afford Ni(II) benzochlorin 67 (λmax = 677 nm in CHCl3) in moderate yield through the intramolecular Friedel–Crafts acylation and 1,2-alkyl rearrangement (Scheme 13a).53–56 Later, the corresponding Cu(II) complexes 66 were found to be cyclised upon treatment with Lewis acids such as BF3·OEt2 or SnCl4, and the resulting Cu(II) benzochlorins 68 were demetalated to the benzochlorin free bases.57 When similar conditions were applied for 5,15-diphenyl Cu(II) porphyrin 69, an oxobenzochlorin product 70 (λmax = 730 nm in CHCl3) and a doubly cyclised product 71 were obtained (Scheme 13b).58 Different from the above examples, the acid treatment of meso-acrylate bearing porphyrins 72 provided purpurin products 73 that had a fused five-membered ring across the meso- and β-positions (Scheme 13c).59–63 An interesting example is that treatment of meso-(phenylethynyl) Zn(II) porphyrin 74 with AgPF6 in CHCl3 gave a porphyrin–dicyclopentadiene-fused porphyrin (dehydropurpurin) dyad 75 (λmax = 645 nm in THF) in 34% yield (Scheme 13d).64 These benzochlorins and purpurins are interesting in photodynamic therapy, since they possess significant photosensitising efficiency.65 The tumour uptake was controlled by judicious choice of the peripheral substituents. Scheme 13  Examples of fusion reaction between meso- and β positions. Intramolecular Friedel–Crafts acylation was used to create oxonaphthoporphyrins by Callot et al.3,66,67 Interestingly, Friedel–Crafts acylation of Ni(II) TPP 76 with aryl anhydrides followed by aerobic oxidation in the presence of pyridine, 4-dimethylaminopyridine, and excess anhydride produced ring-contracted naphthocorrole 77 (λmax = 760 nm in CH2Cl2) in addition to oxonaphthoporphyrin 78 and naphthoporpholactone 79.68,69 They also investigated the effective conversion of 78 to naphthochlorin 81 by the Reformatsky reaction (Scheme 14).70 Scheme 14  Intramolecular Friedel–Crafts acylation of Ni(II) TPP with aryl anhydrides. Dehydropurpurins such as 83 were formed by Pd(0)-ctatalysed [3 + 2] annulation of bromoporphyrins 82 with internal alkynes.71 The peripherally introduced carbon–carbon double bond of 83 was quantitatively cleaved by exposure to air under room light, giving 3,5-dibenzoylporphyrin 84. Treating 84 with NH4OAc furnished a pyridine-fused porphyrinoid, oxopyridochlorin 85. Compound 86 showed unique absorption bands reaching into the NIR region in their neutral state (λmax = 767 nm in CH2Cl2), which was perturbed by protonation (with TFA; λmax ∼ 900 nm in CH2Cl2) (Scheme 15).72 Scheme 15  Pd(0)-catalysed [3 + 2]-type annulation of 82 with internal alkyne and synthesis of oxopyridochlorin 86 and 87. Boyle et al. found that refluxing 5-(2-iodophenyl)-15-(4- methoxycarbonylphenyl)porphyrin Ni(II) complex 88 in the presence of Pd(PPh3)4 (10 mol%) and K3PO4 (10 equiv.) resulted in the formation of fused porphyrin 89, possibly through an intramolecular C–H activation step (Scheme 16).73,74 A similar fusion reaction was also reported for an organozinc species. When 2,3,12,13-tetrabromoporphyrin 90 was heated in the presence of 50 equiv. of zinc in DMSO at 85 °C, doubly fused products 91 and 92 were formed in moderate yields as an inseparable mixture.75 Scheme 16  Examples of metal-mediated fusion reaction. Recently, thienoporphyrins 96 and 97 were prepared by Suzuki–Miyaura coupling and subsequent intramolecular Heck reactions. Comparison of the magnetic, optical, and electrochemical properties indicated that 96 has a larger antiaromatic contribution than 97 (Scheme 17).76 Scheme 17  Thiophene-fused porphyrins 96 and 97. Pyrene-fused porphyrin 98 (λmax = 724 nm in CHCl3) was prepared by the oxidation of meso-(1-pyrenyl)porphyrin Ni(II) complex with PhI(OTf)2 and BF3·OEt2 in 65% yield (Fig. 3).77 The corresponding Zn(II) complex was prepared by the combined use of DDQ and Sc(OTf)3. Naphthalene-fused porphyrins have been reported by several groups. In 2005, Cammidge et al. found the Pd-catalysed intramolecular ring-closure reaction of meso-(8-triflate-1-naphthyl)porphyrin to give naphthalene-fused porphyrin 99.78meso-(1-Naphthyl)porphyrin derivatives 100 and 101 were prepared in 16% and 83% yields, respectively by the oxidative fusion reaction. Fe(ClO4)3·2H2O was recommended for chlorination-free oxidative fusion reaction.79,80 These results indicate the importance of the electron-donating groups of the meso-naphthyl group in the oxidative fusion reaction. These fused porphyrins exhibit the Q-bands at 648–682 nm. Fig. 3  Naphthalene- and pyrene-fused porphyrins. Recently Wu et al. reported N-annulated-perylene-fused Zn(II) porphyrins 102 and 103 by the oxidative cyclisation with DDQ and Sc(OTf)3,81 and perylene monoimide-fused Ni(II) porphyrins 104 and 105 by the oxidation with FeCl3 in nitromethane.82 The unexpected formation of 105 was ascribed to the high reactivity of the β-position in Ni(II) porphyrin. The fused porphyrins 102 and 104 show red-shifted Q-bands in the NIR region at 775 and 803 nm (Fig. 4 and 5), respectively. The lowest Q-band of the triply linked porphyrin 105 is more red-shifted to 897 nm, and the dimer 103 displays an even more red-shifted Q-band at 952 nm. Fig. 4  UV/Vis/NIR absorption spectra of N-annulated perylene-fused porphyrins 102 and 103.  Fig. 5  UV/Vis/NIR absorption spectra of perylene monoimide-fused porphyrins 104 and 105. (iii) β,meso,β Arene-fused porphyrinsAs a pioneering work, Scott et al. reported bis(naphthoazulen-8-one)-fused Cu(II) porphyrins as the first well characterised examples of triply linked systems in 2004 (Scheme 18). They synthesised these molecules from a porphodimethane bearing spiro-acenaphthenone moieties. The metaloporphodimethane underwent photo-induced oxidative rearrangement in the presence of DDQ to form cis- and trans doubly linked porphyrins 106 and 107, which show the Q-bands at 652 and 705 nm. These porphyrins were further oxidised with a combination of FeCl3/DDQ to give meso,β,β, triply fused porphyrins, 108 and 109, respectively. Interestingly, while 109 shows a rather sharp and intense band at 894 nm, largely red-shifted and broad bands are observed in the NIR region for 108 (λmax = 1204 nm). These results reveal the importance of an additional direct linkage for the further red-shifts of the Q-band. The observed more red-shifts for the trans-isomers can be ascribed to the larger transition dipole moments that reflect the molecular symmetry.83 Scheme 18  Naphthoazulenone-fused porphyrins. Anthracene-fused porphyrin 112 was tested by Anderson et al. for a panchromatic dye for dye-sensitised solar cells by using both titanium dioxide and tin oxide as the electron-transport materials.84 They used porphyrins 110 and 111 as reference molecules (Fig. 6). While a solar cell incorporating 112 was shown to exhibit photocurrent collection at the wavelength up to 1100 nm, the device efficiency was low (η < 0.1%). The low conversion efficiency was accounted for in terms of inefficient electron injection into the oxide. Fig. 6  Anthracene-fused porphyrin 112 for dye-sensitised solar cells and reference compounds 110 and 111. Recently porphyrins attached to BODIPY through three direct C–C bonds, 113 and 114 have been synthesised by Wu et al. in a stepwise route (Fig. 7).85 The effective π-conjugation of these molecules can be confirmed from the bathochromic shift of absorption spectra (λmax = 890 nm for 113 and 1040 nm for 114). These values are larger than the corresponding azulene-fused porphyrins (λmax = 1014 nm for 116) and anthracene-fused porphyrins (λmax = 855 nm for 118 and 973 nm for 119), which illuminates the intrinsic potential of a BODIPY moiety in the bathochromic shift of absorptions. Fig. 7  UV/Vis/NIR absorption spectra of BODIPY-fused porphyrins 113 and 114. (iv) Porphyrins fused to four aromatic segmentsGiven the D4h symmetric square molecular shape of porphyrin, it may be possible to fuse four aromatic segments at all the four peripheries of porphyrin. However, such examples have been rather limited to date, due mainly to synthetic difficulty. Osuka et al. reported azulene-fused porphyrins, 115, 116 and 117 in 2006 (Fig. 8).86 These azulene-fused porphyrins show relatively broad absorption spectra in the NIR region (λmax = 855 nm for 115, 1014 nm for 116, and 1136 nm for 117). Anderson et al. reported anthracene-fused porphyrins, 118, 119, and 120.87–89 As compared with the azulene-fused porphyrins, anthracene-fused porphyrins show sharper and more intense Q-bands (λmax = 855 nm for 118, 973 nm for 119, and 1417 nm for 120) (Fig. 9). Nearly planar structures of the quadruply fused porphyrins 117 and 120 have been revealed by X-ray single-crystal diffraction analysis (Fig. 10). Here it is noteworthy that the synthesis of these tetraaromatics-fused porphyrins needs to overcome the intrinsic solubility problem of large planar fused products. Hence, large solubilising groups are implemented at the ester part in the case of 111 and 117, and the 1,8-di(mesityloxy)anthracen-19-yl substituent was employed in the synthesis of 119 and 120 because of its aggregation-preventing steric hindrance and favorable reactivity in the oxidative fusion reaction. Fig. 8  UV/Vis/NIR absorption spectra of azulene-fused porphyrins 115, 116, and 117.  Fig. 9  UV/Vis/NIR absorption spectra of anthracene-fused porphyrins 118, 119, and 120.  Fig. 10  X-ray crystal structures of (a) azulene-fused porphyrin 117 and (b) anthracene-fused porphyrin 120. (v) Thermal fusion of porphyrins with unactivated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)Very recently, Thompson et al. developed the thermal C–H activation fusion process for porphyrins bearing unactivated meso-PAH groups.90 Many PAHs such as naphthalene, pyrene, coronene, and perylene were fused to porphyrins under these conditions. Importantly, this method was applied for Zn(II) and Mg(II) porphyrins that are usually not tolerated under Scholl conditions due to facile demetalation. Although fused products were isolated merely as a mixture of inseparable regioisomers, such a facile and strong fusion protocol would be a quite useful alternative in materials science.III Fused porphyrin oligomersConsiderable attention has been focused on the exploration of extensively π-conjugated porphyrin oligomers.91–97 One of the reliable synthetic strategies is to bridge porphyrins with conjugative linkers such as ethene,98 ethyne99,100 and butadiyne.101,102 Conjugated porphyrin oligomers prepared in this manner exhibit strongly perturbed optical and electronic properties and usually induce red-shifted absorption bands close to the NIR region. A different promising and straightforward method for the effective π-conjugation is to connect two porphyrins with multiple covalent bonds by which the overall structure is forced to be coplanar. Syntheses of large fused porphyrinoids often meet difficulties such as poor solubility and serious aggregation by π–π stacking, and facile oxidative degradation due to raised HOMO levels. Despite these difficulties, the range of fused porphyrin oligomers has been expanded in recent years.(i) β–β Fused porphyrin oligomersPorphyrin wire, defined as a one-dimensionally conjugated porphyrin oligomer with rigid and planar molecular shape, has been explored as an ideal molecular motif where the π-electrons can be fully delocalised over the entire molecule, thus allowing effective electronic connection between the two terminals bridged by porphyrin wires. Efforts have been devoted to synthesise β–β fused porphyrin oligomers. Representative examples are listed in Fig. 11. Crossley et al. reported doubly β–β pyrazinoquinoxaline-bridged porphyrin dimer 122 in 1987,103–107 and extended their strategy to the corresponding trimer and tetramer 123,105,106 a L-shaped trimer,106 and a switchable porphyrin dimer.107 Smith et al. used 40 for the synthesis of 124,111,112 and further extended their strategy to fused pentameric array 125.113 Fused-benzene-bridged porphyrin dimer 121 was first synthesised by Kobayashi et al., and later by Ono et al.108–110 The retro-Diels–Alder route developed by Ono et al. allowed a very facile and elegant access to this fused diporphyrin. Namely, the fused-benzene-bridged Zn(II) porphyrin dimer 130 (λmax = 636 nm, CHCl3 containing 1% pyridine) was effectively prepared by the retro-Diels–Alder reaction of the corresponding bicyclo[2.2.2]octadiene bridged porphyrin dimer 129 (Scheme 19).111,114 A coplanar fused-anthraquinone-bridged porphyrin dimer 127115 (λmax = 663 nm) was also prepared by the retro-Diels–Alder strategy. In this case, upon heating at 270–350 °C, the oxidative demethylation occurred concurrently. Uno and Ono et al. extended their retro-Diels–Alder strategy to fused-benzene-bridged cruciform Zn(II) porphyrin pentamers 128 (λmax = 762 nm in pyridine).110 Fused anthraquinone-bridged porphyrin dimer 131, prepared by a subsequent Diels–Alder reaction, was subsequently converted to a hexafullenodiporphyrin 132 upon the cycloaddition reaction with C60 (Scheme 20).116 Very recently, Shinokubo et al. reported the synthesis of pyrazine-fused porphyrin dimer 126 by DDQ oxidation of β-aminoporphyrin.117 The synthesised dimer exhibits red-shifted Q-like bands reaching the NIR region, which may be appealing for materials science.

(ii) meso–meso,β–β,β–β Triply linked porphyrin arrays (porphyrin tapes)Osuka et al. have explored meso–meso,β–β,β–β triply linked porphyrin arrays (porphyrin tapes) by the oxidative doubly fusion reactions of singly meso–meso linked porphyrin arrays.10,11,117–121 These studies on the directly fused porphyrin arrays were initiated by a serendipitous finding that the oxidation of 5,10,15-triaryl Ni(II) porphyrins 133 with tris(4-bromophenyl)aminium hexachloroantimonate (BAHA) gave meso-β doubly fused porphyrin dimer 134 (λmax = 756 nm in CHCl3) (Scheme 21).122 The oxidative fusion reaction of meso–meso linked porphyrin oligomers was first accomplished by using BAHA as an oxidant.123 While porphyrin tapes were obtained in good yields, the concurrent peripheral chlorination at the porphyrin periphery was problematic. The use of hexafluorobenzene as a solvent led to significant suppression of the peripheral chlorination.124 Later, a combination of DDQ with Sc(OTf)3 was found to be a quite effective reagent to cause the clean oxidative fusion to afford triply linked porphyrin oligomers.125Fig. 12 shows the X-ray crystal structure of triply fused diporphyrin 136_2.126 The two Zn(II) porphyrin units are completely coplanar with a mean-plane deviation value of 0.051 Å. Scheme 21  Synthesis of meso-β fused diporphyrins 134.  Fig. 12  X-ray crystal structure of a completely fused diporphyrin 136_2.126 The linear porphyrin tapes 136_n were synthesised and characterised up to dodecamer 136_12 in the first report,125 and later were extended to 24-mer with the help of bulky meso-substituents.127 The absorption red-shift in a series of triply fused porphyrin tape is remarkable, reaching deeply into the IR region (Fig. 13). These spectra have been interpreted in terms of the effective π-conjugation along the longer molecular axis. Fig. 13  UV/Vis/IR absorption spectra of porphyrin tapes 136_n. Two-dimensionally extended porphyrin oligomers such as L-shaped trimer 137, T-shaped tetramer 139, and even square-shaped tetramer (porphyrin sheet) 138 were prepared (Fig. 14).128,129 The porphyrin sheet 138 holds the central cyclooctatetraene (COT) core that is forced to be planar. Probably because of this structure, 138 exhibits a strong paratropic ring current.129 Dimeric porphyrin tapes were prepared by other methods.130–132 Dimeric porphyrin tapes fused with pyrene units were prepared by the oxidation with FeCl3.133 Fig. 14  Two-dimensionally extended porphyrin tapes. The conductance of porphyrin tapes 142 was compared with those of 1,3-butadiyne-bridged porphyrin oligomers 140 and meso–meso singly linked porphyrin oligomers 141 (Fig. 15). All the porphyrin oligomers were attached to the end 4-pyridylethyne groups for better connection to gold. The conductance was measured by a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) with a gold tip and a gold substrate, and Au∣oligoporphyrin∣Au electric junction. The attenuation decay factors were determined to be 0.042 ± 0.005 Å−1 for 140, 0.11 ± 0.01 Å−1 for 141 and 0.019 ± 0.01 Å−1 for 142.134 The porphyrin tape 142 was most conducting but only better than the array 140 (Fig. 15). Fig. 15  Linear porphyrin oligomers for the conductance measurement. The oxidation of 5,10,15-triaryl Ni(II) porphyrin 133 with BAHA led to the production of meso-β doubly linked diporphyrin 134 in 53% yield.122 A similar oxidation of 5,15-diaryl Ni(II) porphyrin 143 with DDQ and Sc(OTf)3 gave further coupled meso,β doubly linked porphyrin oligomers 145_n in addition to meso,β singly linked dimer 144 (Scheme 22).135 The lowest energy Q-bands become increasingly intensified and red-shifted upon elongation of the array as following; dimer (741 nm), trimer (892 nm), tetramer (996 nm) and pentamer (1075 nm). These tapes exhibit large TPA values.136 A similar meso,β doubly linked fused diporphyrin was obtained from the oxidation of 143 with TeCl4.137 Scheme 22  Synthesis of meso-β fused porphyrin oligomers. Despite the attractive optical properties of the porphyrin tapes, their poor solubility and facile oxidative degradation hampered further studies on longer arrays. The former arose from the flat molecular shape that induces strong π–π stacking and the latter originated from high-lying HOMOs. Facially encumbered porphyrin tapes have been invented to increase both the chemical stability and solubility by suppressing π–π stacking and protecting against the attack of oxidising agents.138,139 Porphyrin tapes 148_n bearing two different aryl groups, a 2,4,6-tris(3,5-di-tert-butylphenoxyl)phenyl group (protecting) and a 3,5-dioctyloxyphenyl group (solubility), were prepared up to 24-mer (Scheme 23). Importantly, detailed studies on these arrays led to an estimate of the effective conjugation length (ECL) to be n = 14–16.127 Scheme 23  Synthesis of 148_n. Recently electron-deficient porphyrin tapes have been developed to improve the chemical stability by lowering the HOMO level. Employing a 3,5-di-tert-butylphenyl-substituted porphyrin as a donor-type (D) and a pentafluorophenyl-substituted porphyrin as an acceptor type (A), hybrid D–A dimer 149 and D–A–D trimer 150 as well as A–A dimer 151 were prepared (Fig. 16).140,141 Owing to their better solubility in common organic solvents, the crystal structures of 150 and 151 were obtained (Fig. 17). As expected, the cyclic voltammetry experiments revealed positively shifted oxidation and reduction potentials for these electron-deficient porphyrin tapes; e.g. the first oxidation potentials (Eox1: potentials vs. ferrocene/ferrocenium ion couple) of 0.22 V for 149, 0.41 V for 151 and −0.03 V for 136_2, respectively, which clearly illustrated increased stability against oxidative degradation. Interestingly, the TPA cross-section values measured by a wavelength-scanning open-aperture Z-scan method were increased in hybrid tapes 149 and 150 to be 2200 and 27000 GM respectively, probably as a consequence of the donor–acceptor electronic properties. Fig. 16  Electron-deficient porphyrin tapes 149, 150, and 151.  Fig. 17  X-ray crystal structures of electron-deficient porphyrin tapes (a) 150 and (b) 151. In the last decade, various applications of porphyrin tapes have been reported by a several groups. Host 152, which consists of two porphyrin tapes arranged in a face-to-face fashion with a certain separation so as to accommodate guest molecules, was designed and prepared. Upon complexation with 4,4′-bipyridine, the host 152 displayed a strong negative cooperativity in the second guest binding, suggesting the notable electronic communication of the triply linked Zn(II) porphyrin dimer.142 In sharp contrast, the same host molecule showed strong positive heterotropic cooperativity for guest binding of 4,4′-bipyridine and C60.143 Triply linked Cu(II) porphyrin dimer 154 bearing hydrophilic and hydrophobic tails was reported to form a room-temperature columnar liquid crystal (LC), which showed upon photoirradiation at 355 nm a maximum transient conductivity of 2.4 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1.144 In a similar approach, Cu(II) complexes of triply linked porphyrin dimers bearing dodecyl chains and semifluoroalkyl chains and only semifluoroalkyl chains were prepared. These complexes behave similarly in solution but display different semiconducting behaviors in LC states.145 By elongating the porphyrin tapes, ultralow-bandgap columnar LC semiconductors with wide LC mesophase temperature and high-absorption temperature were developed. LC made from a pentameric porphyrin tape showed high charge carrier mobility (2.4 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1).146Multi-charge storage capabilities of porphyrin tapes have been revealed by Diederich et al. Typically, C60–Zn(II) porphyrin tape conjugate 153 displayed nine reversible redox processes involving a total of fifteen electrons.147,148 Porphyrin tape 155 was used for construction of addressable patterned surfaces on a Ag(100) substrate with deposition with C60 (Fig. 18).149 Fig. 18  Various derivatives of the porphyrin tape. The singlet excited state of the porphyrin tapes is usually very short-lived,147,150 but halogenated porphyrin tapes 156 and 157 underwent very fast intersystem crossing to their triplet excited states, whose lifetimes were relatively long. These properties are suitable as photoactive materials in reverse saturable absorption in the NIR region.151(iii) Fused hexaphyrinsIn recent years, expanded porphyrins have emerged as a promising class of functional chromophores that have larger and more flexible conjugated electronic systems as compared with porphyrins.152–159 5,10,15,20,25,30-Hexakis(pentafluorophenyl)-substituted [26]hexaphyrin(1.1.1.1.1.1)160 is a benchmark expanded porphyrin with regard to its strong 26π aromaticity and flat rectangular molecular shape. Its shorter molecular side is similar in length to that of porphyrins.161,162 Taking advantage of this structurally matching feature, novel π-extended hexaphyrins have been envisioned by peripheral fusion reactions. Actually, meso–meso,β–β,β–β triply linked porphyrin–hexaphyrin hybrid 158 was synthesised by Osuka et al. in 2011.163 The hexaphyrin unit was formed by acid-catalysed cross-condensation of meso-porphyrinyl dipyrromethane and 5-pentafluorophenyldipyrromethane with pentafluorobenzaldehyde, followed by DDQ/Sc(OTf)3 oxidation. The hybrid tape 158 exhibited split Soret-like bands at 532, 566 and 752 nm and red-shifted Q-like band at 1333 nm, indicating effective conjugation over both the porphyrin and hexaphyrin segments. The tape 158 was reduced with NaBH4 to give corresponding 28π congener 159 (Fig. 19). Interestingly, the reduced tape 159 showed solvent-polarity-dependent antiaromaticity. The antiaromatic character became much stronger in its bis-Rh(I) complex 160 owing to the restricted conformation in the hexaphyrin segment by Rh(I) coordination.164 The structure of 161 was elucidated by X-ray diffraction analysis (Fig. 20). Fig. 19  Fused porphyrin–hexaphyrins 158–161, and anthracene-appended hexaphyrins 162–163, and UV/Vis/NIR absorption spectra of fused hexaphyrins 158 and 163.  Fig. 20  X-ray crystal structure of fused hexaphyrins: (a) 161 and (b) 163. Very recently doubly anthracene-fused hexaphyrin 163 was synthesised (Fig. 19).165 The oxidative fusion reaction of bis(mesityloxy)anthracene-bearing hexaphyrin bis-Au(III) complex 162 proceeded successfully upon treatment with DDQ and Sc(OTf)3. The single-crystal X-ray analysis displayed an elongated, rectangular, almost planar structure of 163 (Fig. 20). In the UV/Vis/NIR absorption spectrum, two sharp and intense bands were observed mainly at 743 and 1467 nm (Fig. 19). The most red-shifted band was remarkably sharp and intensified (ε = 108500 M−1 cm−1, fwhm = 223 cm−1). These absorption characteristics originate from the effective conjugation along the long molecular axis that enables permissible HOMO–LUMO transition.IV Other fused porphyrinsAnderson et al. examined the optical properties of various 1,4-phenylene-bridged porphyrin dimers (Scheme 24 and Fig. 21).166 Dimer 166 was prepared from Pd-catalysed cyclisation of 165, and dimer 168 was prepared from intramolecular Friedel–Crafts acylation of 167 and was transformed to fused dimer 169 by the condensation with malononitrile. Dimer 167 was converted to dimer 170 by Grignard addition reaction and was further converted to dimer 171. Among these, 166 shows the most red-shifted absorption band at 1077 nm in toluene containing 1% pyridine, and 168 and 171 show the lowest energy Q-bands at 907 and 717 nm, respectively. While 168 and 171 display fluorescence (λem = 960 nm, Φem = 0.017 for 168 and λem = 736 nm, Φem = 0.10 for 171), 166 is non-fluorescent. It is noteworthy that the fluorescence quantum yields of 168 and 171 are remarkably high in the NIR region. Femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy has revealed a very rapid decay of the S1-state of 166. TPA values as determined by two-photon excited fluorescence in CCl4/pyridine are 2100 GM at 1200 nm for 168 and 7300 GM at 878 nm for 171. Scheme 24  Synthesis of p-phenylene-bridged porphyrin tapes 166, 168, 169, and 171.  Fig. 21  UV/Vis/NIR absorption spectra (solid) and emission (dashed) of p-phenylene-linked diporphyrins 168 and 171, and porphyrin tape 136_2. As a pioneering work, Anderson et al. reported the synthesis of 5,15-dialkylideneporphyrin 172 as a hybrid of porphyrin and TCNQ. The absorption spectrum of 172 exhibits two bands of similar intensity, distinctly different from those of normal porphyrins.167 Cumulenic dimer 173 and quinonoidal dimer 174 were also prepared.168 The coplanar conformation of 173 was revealed by X-ray analysis. While 173 shows the absorption spectrum containing a strong, broad band at 1080 nm, the absorption spectrum of 174 is less bathochromically shifted. Not confirmed by X-ray crystallography, this has been ascribed to an expected non-planar conformation of 174. Triply linked dimer 175 was also prepared, which shows a peak at 958 nm (Fig. 22).169 Fig. 22  UV/Vis/NIR absorption spectra of quinonoidal porphyrins. Very recently, Wu et al. synthesised non-fused and fused quinonoidal porphyrins 176 and 177 through Corey–Fuchs reaction of 5,15-dioxo-porphodimethene with CBr4 and PPh3 and subsequent Suzuki–Miyaura coupling to give 176. The final oxidative ring-closure of 176 with DDQ and methanesulfonic acid gave 177. Both the Soret and Q-bands are more red-shifted in 177, and TPA values as determined by a wavelength-scanning open-aperture Z-scan method are 450 GM for 176 and 510 GM for 177 at 1200 nm (Fig. 23).170 Fig. 23  UV/Vis/NIR absorption spectra of quinoidal porphyrins. V ConclusionsIn the last decade, the chemistry of fused porphyrinoids has witnessed remarkable progress. Various aromatic groups including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, heteroaromatic molecules, and porphyrins themselves are fused on the periphery of porphyrins in various manners. The fusion reactions cause structural constraints to force the coplanar conformations of the fused segments and porphyrins, hence giving rise to large perturbation of the optical and electronic properties of porphyrins. It has been increasingly recognised that porphyrins are, simply from the synthetic viewpoint, an interesting and promising platform to test various chemical transformations, particularly transition-metal-catalysed reactions.171–174 Fused porphyrinoids thus synthesised display significantly altered optical and electronic properties, which are rather difficult to see in other non-porphyrinic substrates. In addition to pure academic interest, increasing attention has been paid to these fused porphyrinoids because of the recent demands in practical applications such as OFETs, photovoltaic solar cells, long-wavelength penetrating photodynamic therapy, and so on. Despite the promise of the fused porphyrinoids, there are only a limited number of the oxidative fusion reactions such as FeCl3 oxidation and co-use of DDQ and Sc(OTf)3. New efficient fusion reactions under milder conditions are highly desirable in future developments.AcknowledgementsThis work was supported by Grants-in Aid (no. 22245006 (A) and 20108006 “pi-Space”) from MEXT.
