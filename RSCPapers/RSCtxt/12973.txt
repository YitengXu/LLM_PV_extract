    , Accepted 18th May 2020First published on 20th May 2020AbstractOrgano-lead trihalide perovskites (OLTPs) form a highly interesting class of semiconductors, which might play an important role in future photovoltaics and optoelectronics. Particularly, formamidinium lead triiodide – methylammonium lead tribromide mixed perovskite (FAPbI3)0.9(MAPbBr3)0.1 is one of the most important representatives of this material class. In order to estimate the full optoelectronic potential of this perovskite system and thus to foster its future technological use, it is essential to investigate high-quality single crystals with the lowest structural as well as chemical defect density and with a stoichiometry relevant for their thin-film counterparts. However, the liquid growth of perovskite crystals without seed crystals is usually challenging and becomes even more demanding in the case of mixed cation–mixed halide single crystals, making it difficult to access their inherent properties. Here, we introduce a new efficient seed crystal free re-fill crystallization method (RFCM) based on inverse temperature crystallization (ITC) to grow large-sized single crystals. We performed qualitative and quantitative analyses, which confirmed the targeted elemental composition and the exact stoichiometry of the grown crystals. By means of polychromatic and monochromatic X-ray diffraction (XRD), we have demonstrated the high single crystal quality of the RFCM crystals, superior to crystals obtained by the seed crystal method. Steady-state photoluminescence (PL), absorption and temperature-dependent electrical measurements completed the investigation and enabled the determination of the optical band gap, relative permittivity and electrical conductivity of the grown single crystals. The conductivity clearly exhibits an ionic contribution and is therefore relevant for photovoltaic and optoelectronic implementation of this perovskite system.
Introduction
Organo-lead trihalide perovskites (OLTPs) define a remarkable class of semiconductors exhibiting strong light absorption in the visible,1–4 tuneable band gaps,5,6 long charge carrier lifetimes7,8 and high charge carrier mobilities.2,9 The optoelectronic properties enable a variety of technical applications ranging from light emitting diodes (LEDs),10,11 lasers,12,13 and photodetectors,14,15 to solar cells,16,17 which are usually made of solution18 or vacuum-processed19 polycrystalline perovskite layers several hundred nanometres in thickness, but can now also be produced from thin single crystals.15,17 For perovskite solar cells, power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of almost 24%20 have been achieved in recent years by the incorporation of additives20 as well as organic and inorganic cations and halides16,21,22 into the lattice structure of formamidinium lead triiodide (FAPbI3). Especially the double cation – double halide perovskite formamidinium lead triiodide – methylammonium lead tribromide (FAPbI3)0.9(MAPbBr3)0.1 made a significant contribution to the field of solar cell research16,23 and became one of the most important compositions within the class of OLTP. A decisive factor for further progress in this field and hence for commercialization is the comprehensive determination of the optoelectronic characteristics of (FAPbI3)0.9(MAPbBr3)0.1 single crystals with the same stoichiometry as their polycrystalline thin film analogues. Methods commonly used to grow OLTP single crystals are liquid growth methods,24 such as inverse temperature crystallisation (ITC),25 cooling acid-based precursor solution crystallisation,24,26 and antisolvent vapour-assistant crystallisation (AVC).8 Fast crystal growth,25 easy handling, and low solvent-consumption makes the ITC method superior. However, growing large-sized perovskite crystals to study their optoelectronic properties without seed crystals is difficult and becomes even more difficult for mixed cation–mixed halide perovskite crystals like (FAPbI3)0.9(MAPbBr3)0.1.27 In case of the latter, highly concentrated perovskite precursor solutions lead to the formation of polycrystals due to the strong nucleation of bromine27 (Br) in the presence of iodine (I). Diluted perovskite precursor solutions on the other hand allow the growth of mixed perovskite crystals, but reduce the time span of crystal growth and thus the crystal size, forcing the use of seed crystals. Even though it is possible to obtain large-sized crystals by seed-crystal methods, these crystals show a poor crystallinity, as we also confirmed here by X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns. On these accounts, studying the single crystal properties of large-sized perovskite crystals of high quality is very demanding. To overcome these challenges, we developed a new efficient seed crystal free re-fill crystallization method (RFCM) for control of an ITC-based process to grow (FAPbI3)0.9(MAPbBr3)0.1 perovskite single crystals. The key role of the utilized synthesis apparatus is a simple and fast exchange of perovskite precursor solution during the in situ crystal growth, which facilitates the control of crystal size and avoids the use of seed crystals. By this approach, we synthesized large-sized (FAPbI3)0.9(MAPbBr3)0.1 perovskite single crystals and confirmed their high-quality by two different kinds of XRD techniques: the polychromatic Laue transmission diffraction is applied to the crystal bulk, and the monochromatic XRD for both, to the bulk and to the different crystal surfaces. Particularly, in the case of mixed cation–mixed halide crystals like the (FAPbI3)0.9(MAPbBr3)0.1, it is essential to prove the incorporation of MAPbBr3 into the FAPbI3 crystal lattice by qualitative analyses. Consequently, we applied the Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) for the cation methylammonium (CH3NH3+) and the cation formamidinium (CH5N2+) as well as X-ray fluorescence (XRF) measurements for Br, I and lead (Pb). Furthermore, it is important to verify the stoichiometry of the crystals. That is why we used elemental analysis to quantify the mass fraction of hydrogen (H), carbon (C) and nitrogen (N), and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis as well as inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) to determine the relevant amount of Br, I and Pb. In total, the correct chemical composition and the proof of the expected ionic species provide evidence of the growth of high-quality (FAPbI3)0.9(MAPbBr3)0.1 perovskite single crystals enabling in the following a correct assignment of the measured absorption and photoluminescence (PL) as well as the temperature- and frequency dependent electrical conductivity σ and dielectric constant εr of the crystals.
Experimental section
Materials
Lead iodide (PbI2) (99.99%, trace metal basis) was obtained from TCI. Lead bromide (PbBr2) (99.999%, trace metal basis), methylammonium bromide (MABr) (>99.5%, recrystallized 4 times), and formamidinium iodide (FAI) (>99.5%, recrystallized 4 times) were all purchased from Lumtec. γ-Butyrolactone (GBL) was acquired from Alfa Aesar with a purity of >99%. All chemicals and solvents were used as received without further purification.
Growth of (FAPbI3)0.9(MAPbBr3)0.1 single crystals with RFCM
The perovskite precursor solutions were prepared in a nitrogen filled glovebox with water and oxygen contents lower than one parts per million (ppm). The crystal growth took place under ambient conditions at a temperature of 21.5 ± 1 °C and a humidity of 35 ± 10%. The (FAPbI3)0.9(MAPbBr3)0.1 precursor solution was prepared as follows: MABr (94.05 mg, 0.84 mmol), PbBr2 (308.29 mg, 0.84 mmol), FAI (1300.09 mg, 7.56 mmol) and PbI2 (3485.23 mg, 7.56 mmol) were dissolved in 12 ml GBL. The precursor solution was heated up to 80 °C and stirred for 2 h for full solubility. 3 ml of the precursor solution was filtered via a 0.2 μm pore size polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) syringe filter and heated up to 110 °C to start the crystallization. To obtain crystals with sizes of 0.5 cm to 0.8 cm, the precursor solution was changed 3 to 4 times.
Material characterisation

Structural analysis techniques. 
FT-IR measurements were carried out with a Bruker IFS 66v/S FTIR-spectrometer. For this purpose, 0.091 g of potassium bromide (KBr) and 0.014 g of (FAPbI3)0.9(MAPbBr3)0.1 crystal powder were mixed together to form a pellet.
XRF measurements were carried out with an XR-100T detector from Amptek and an X-ray machine from PHYWE using an unfiltered Mo (Molybdenum)-Kα radiation source (V = 35 kV, I = 0.1 mA). Further XRF measurements, as well as powder and single crystal XRD spectra were recorded by an X-ray diffraction system General Electric XRD 3003 TT using a Cu(Copper)-Kα1 radiation source with a wavelength λ of 1.5406 Å (V = 40 kV, I = 40 mA). The measurements were performed under ambient conditions. Additional XRD measurements were recorded on different surfaces of the single crystal. In order to measure the different surfaces of the single crystal, thin Kapton tape was used to fix the samples. X-ray intensity measurements were carried out by reflectometry using a laboratory X-ray diffractometer with a Mo-Kα radiation source (λ = 0.71073 Å). The scattered X-ray intensities were plotted against the momentum transfer along the surface normal qz = (4π/λ) sinθ, where θ is the scattering angle. For the Laue measurements, a Mo-X-ray source was used at 60 kV. In transmission geometry, Laue pattern at RT were obtained on imaging plates which were placed at 150 mm distance from the sample.
The elemental analysis to determine the elements H, C and N was performed on a vario MICRO cube micro elemental analyzer. Measurements to determine the mass fraction of Pb were performed with a Vista-MPX CCD Simultaneous ICP-OES spectrometer. For this, 15.1 mg of (FAPbI3)0.9(MAPbBr3)0.1 crystal powder was solved in 16 ml diluted acqua regia (12 H2O:12 HCl:1 HNO3). To determine the mass fraction of I with ICP-OES, 13.83 mg of the crystal powder was solved in 7.5 ml of a 1 molar solution of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and placed in an ultrasonic bath for full solubility. After this, 0.5 ml of a sodium borohydride (NaBH4) solution was added.
Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images were taken with a SEM Carl Zeiss Ultra 55+ using a secondary electron detector. EDX measurements were carried out with an INCAPentaFET-x3 Si(Li) detector. The measurements were performed in high vacuum.

Optical and electrical characterisation
Reflection and transmission measurements were carried out in air using a PerkinElmer Lambda 950 UV/VIS spectrometer to determine the absorbance. Steady-state PL measurements were performed by means of an Acton SpectraPro SP-2300 monochromator coupled to a nitrogen cooled CCD system from Princeton Instruments using a blue laser for excitation (λ = 405 nm).
For electrical measurements, the crystal surfaces were coated with gold (d = 80 nm) using a Polaron Emitech SC7640 sputter coater. Capacitance and conductance measurements were performed in a closed-cycle cryostat, filled with helium as contact gas, by using an Agilent E4980A Precision LCR Meter in four terminal configuration. An AC amplitude of 1 V was used to probe the crystal. The capacitance Cp as well as the electrical conductance Gp, the inverse of the electrical resistance Rp, were derived from the impedance Z, using the following relationship: (1)These values can be used to determine the relative frequency dependent permittivity εr according to (2)as well as to calculate the conductivity σ (3)with the vacuum permittivity ε0, the thickness d and the area A of the plate capacitor.
Results and discussion
Single crystal growth with RFCM
RFCM (Fig. 1a and Fig. S1, ESI†) is designed for growing OLTP single crystals by ITC without seed crystals and is based on the supersaturation of the precursor materials in an appropriate solvent24 to form a precipitation in two steps: the spontaneous crystal nucleation and the crystal growth.28 To grow (FAPbI3)0.9(MAPbBr3)0.1 perovskite crystals, inorganic lead halides PbX2 (X = Br−, I−) and organic salts ZX (Z = CH3NH3+, CH5N2+) are mixed together in the polar solvent GBL. Subsequently, the dissolved precursor solution (TDissolving = 80 °C, VPrecursor solution = 4 ml) is heated up to a defined temperature (TGrowing = 110 °C). The solubility of the target mineral ZPbX3 decreases in the solvent with rising temperature,24 resulting in a supersaturated solution and formation of crystal seeds.28 In order to prevent the formation of polycrystals, we used a diluted precursor solution of 0.7 M to nucleate (FAPbI3)0.9(MAPbBr3)0.1 crystals. The interval of crystal nucleation in diluted conditions (tGrowing = 1.5–2 h), and the crystals which form on the bottom of the vessel are rather small. However, the construction of RFCM allows to extract some volume fraction (VExtracted solution = 3 ml) of the supernatant and, simultaneously, to add fresh concentrated precursor solution of 110 °C. The construction principle of the RFCM setup is explained in the following: an anti-vibration mat (1) and a sand-filled box (2) reduce vibrations, which would induce structural defects during the extended growth phase and thus would hinder the preparation of high-quality crystals. The temperature sensor (3) of the hot plate (4) guarantees a constant oil temperature of 110 °C in the Petri dish (5). The perovskite crystal growth takes place in a custom-made vessel (6) with two glass tubes. After the initial crystal-growing interval, we slowly add 110 °C hot precursor solution (7) to the vessel, and simultaneously remove the used solution (8) by a syringe. During this procedure, the crystal remains in the same position. The attached Dimroth condenser (9–11) minimizes the effect of condensed and cooled GBL droplets, which would disturb the crystal growth by the temperature gradient induced in the vessel. In summary, this sophisticated but mechanically simple construction provides extra control on the growth conditions of (FAPbI3)0.9(MAPbBr3)0.1 which favour large single crystals. A typical crystal with pronounced facets obtained from a successful growth is shown in Fig. 1b. The Laue transmission pattern (Fig. 1c), which stems from the X-ray beam passing the whole crystal, shows a textbook like single crystal pattern, i.e. sharp spots without indications of twinning or broadening. The sharp Laue spots confirm that the sample is single crystalline throughout the whole volume.

Qualitative and quantitative analyses
In a first step, we qualitatively prove the incorporation of the organic cations CH3NH3+ and CH5N2+ into the crystal structure by FT-IR. Fig. 2a shows the peaks of the CH3NH3+ rock29 at wavenumbers 912 cm−1 and 1286 cm−1, as well as the symmetrical NH3+ bending and stretching29 at 1471 cm−1 and 3161 cm−1. The transmittance spectrum also shows the (C–H) bending30 at 1049 cm−1 and the (CN) stretching30 at 1711 cm−1, which are unambiguous indicators for the integration of the CH5N2+ cation. To verify the presence of Br, I and Pb in the crystal, we used the convenient and accurate XRF technique (ESI,† Fig. S2 and Table S1). The corresponding experimental data of crystal powder and crystal surface reveal the Kα (11.9 keV) and Kβ (13.3 keV) lines of the K-shell emission of Br.31 Besides the detection of Br, Fig. S2 (ESI†) shows the Lα, Lβ and Lγ emission lines of I31 as well as the lines Lα, Lβ, Lγ and Mα of Pb.31 The clear evidence of the three elements is also confirmed by EDX measurements of the crystal surface shown in Fig. 2b. The exact assignment of the emission lines of Br, I and Pb enabled us to determine the mass fraction of the three elements by the respective peak areas (Table 1) and confirms the homogeneous distribution of the elements within the crystalline lattice by mapping images (Fig. 2c). To verify the stoichiometry of the (FAPbI3)0.9(MAPbBr3)0.1 crystal more quantitatively, we analysed the crystal powder by elemental analysis and by ICP-OES. The experimental values of the elements in Table 1 are in good agreement with the theoretical predictions. It thus can be concluded, that the stoichiometric compositions of (FAPbI3)0.9(MAPbBr3)0.1 precursor solution and resulting crystal fully coincide.

Structural properties
The XRD results of the crystal powder obtained from ground crystals in Fig. S3 and Table S2 (ESI†), match the simulated data for the simple cubic (Sc) lattice of (FAPbI3)0.9(MAPbBr3)0.1 very well.32 Moreover, from the absence of the PbI2 peak at 0.83 Å−1, which is usually a clear indicator of decomposition, we conclude the crystal powder to be stable under ambient conditions over one year (Fig. S4, ESI†). Therefore, the incorporation of MAPbBr3 stabilizes the crystal27 and makes it superior to the unstable FAPbI3 crystal,33,34 which decomposes immediately after completion of the growth process, as shown in Fig. S4 and S5 (ESI†).
In order to demonstrate the benefit of the in situ growth process inherent to RFCM in comparison to the seed-crystal method, we compared out-of-plane XRD measurements of crystals grown by RFCM and by the seed-crystal technique, respectively (Fig. 3). RFCM crystals were grown as described by simultaneous exchange of precursor and used solution (Fig. 3b). For the seed-crystal technique, a small crystal was taken from the used solution and placed in a new bottle with fresh precursor solution. Both methods result in samples of polyhedral shape and sharp edges (see images in the insets of Fig. 3) and visually imply single crystals in both cases. X-ray Bragg scattering in reflection geometry was obtained for both crystals (Fig. 3a). The RFCM crystal reveals a {110} peak series for the dominant surface, cf.Fig. 3b. This implies that the Laue transmission image was also recorded along this direction. Instead, a closer inspection of the X-ray data of crystals grown conventionally by a seed-crystal are of overall lower quality. For example, while we find the main {110} peak series in both samples, for the seed-crystal grown sample, additional diffraction peaks occur, which can be identified as (111), (300) and (421) Bragg reflexes (Fig. 3c). Moreover, the so-called rocking scan of the (110) reflex, which probes for mosaicity, reveals two additional peaks, in comparison to the rocking scan on the RFCM crystal, indicating the presence of twinned structural domains at the sample surface. Further out-of-plane XRD measurements were obtained from the crystal bulk by dividing the crystal into two equal parts with a scalpel along the [110] direction (see Fig. S6a, ESI†). The XRD results confirmed the single crystal growth by RFCM (Fig. S6b, ESI†) due to the dominant {110} peak series and the sharp rocking peak of the (2−20) plane. The X-ray data of the conventional grown crystal (Fig. S6c, ESI†) are comparable to those of Fig. 3c with additional Brag reflexes and further peaks in the rocking scan, which underlines the above mentioned statements.

A more detailed study was performed by complementary XRD measurements of the different (FAPbI3)0.9(MAPbBr3)0.1 crystal surfaces. We were able to diffract from five physical facets as shown in Fig. 4 and Fig. S7 (ESI†). The base plane of the crystal shows a (−1−1−1) peak series while the other four facets are orientated along the [110] direction (Fig. 4c). This suggests that the free surfaces of this crystal belong to {110} planes, while the base plane, i.e. the surface that faces the sample holder in the RFCM is either {110} or {111}. Based on the crystal structure, the {111} surface should present the octahedral facets while the {110} surface should present the octahedral edges. The surface corrugation obtained from a simple cut of a cubic MAPbBr3 structure for cut-off planes along {111} and {110} is shown as an insertion in Fig. 4b. Note that this sketch is only a cartoon to highlight the symmetry of the surface assuming that no reconstruction occurs upon cutting the crystal by the surface. All free surfaces are {110} facets, the crystal shape resembles either a rhombic dodecahedron (inset in Fig. S8, ESI†) or a truncated dodecahedron (Fig. 4a and c). This is remarkable, since other cubic phase perovskite crystals, in particular MAPbBr3, methylammonium lead trichloride (MAPbCl3) and formamidinium lead tribromide (FAPbBr3) systems show {100} free surfaces, i.e. the crystal shape is a hexamer (or better a cube) while α-FAPbI3 system exhibits commonly {110} and {111} free surfaces, i.e. the crystal shape is cubo-octahedron or dodecahedron.25,33–36 These differences point to different surface energies according to the Wulff construction. Note that for a {100} cut-off plane, the octahedral tips are presented to the surface. We speculate that this difference in surface orientation observed for large single crystals may also influence nanoparticle formation. For example, the well-known hexamers (nanocubes) obtained for the MAPbBr3 system37 may not form readily for (FAPbI3)0.9(MAPbBr3)0.1 perovskite. A detailed analysis of the Bragg peak positions of the (FAPbI3)0.9(MAPbBr3)0.1 crystal powder (Fig. S3 and Table S2, ESI†) yield a cubic lattice constant of a = 6.332 ± 0.006 Å. In contrast, the determined value of the cubic phase of pure α-FAPbI3 (Fig. S5 and Table S3, ESI†) is a = 6.382 ± 0.015 Å, while the evaluation of the cubic phase of MAPbBr3 shows a = 5.929 ± 0.001 Å (Fig. S9 and Table S4, ESI†), both in good agreement with the literature.26,27,38 The smaller unit cell of the (FAPbI3)0.9(MAPbBr3)0.1 system indicates that the incorporation of the cation CH3NH3+ and of the halide ion Br− condenses the α-FAPbI3 lattice by 0.78% due to smaller effective radiuses compared to ion I− and the cation CH5N2+, respectively.39,40 Compositional engineering may enhance the stabilization of the crystal lattice by tuning lattice parameters and bond environment.41,42

Optoelectronic properties
The absorbance of the (FAPbI3)0.9(MAPbBr3)0.1 single crystal in Fig. 5a covers the full visible range of the electromagnetic spectrum from 400 nm to 850 nm, elucidating its importance as light absorber in photovoltaics. The direct band-gap of Eg = 1.447 eV estimated by the Tauc-plot (Fig. 5b) is in good accordance with literature27 and comparable with Eg of α-FAPbI3 single crystals.33 Accordingly, the stabilization of the crystal through the incorporation of MAPbBr3 into the crystal lattice causes only a slight blue shift, but generally maintains the optical properties of α-FAPbI3. The blue shift is also observed in PL for (FAPbI3)0.9(MAPbBr3)0.1 single crystals (Fig. 5a), as compared to the literature value for α-FAPbI3 single crystal with its PL maximum at 820 nm.43 The PL spectral shape with two peaks at 794 nm and 844 nm may be due to self-absorption and multiple reflection,44 though such a line shape has not yet been observed in double cation – double halide perovskite single crystals.

(c) Temperature dependent relative permittivity εr measured in the frequency range of 20–100 kHz (Heating cycle). (d) Temperature dependent electrical AC conductivity σ measured at 20 Hz. The inset shows an Arrhenius law for temperatures above 200 K. 
To study the electrical properties of (FAPbI3)0.9(MAPbBr3)0.1 single crystals, we vacuum-deposited gold electrodes on two opposing surfaces of a single crystal, as shown in the inset of Fig. 5c. The geometry of the device corresponds to that of a plate capacitor, allowing to measure the temperature dependent relative permittivity εr (Fig. 5c) and the AC electrical conductivity σ (Fig. 5d) with a temperature ramp of 0.7 K min−1. At temperatures below 200 K, the observed σ (20 Hz) = 2 × 10−9 S m−1 is about two orders of magnitude below the conductivity of undoped Gallium arsenide (GaAs).45 As the crystal behaves like an intrinsic semiconductor in this temperature range, we conclude on an extremely low density of impurities, which might lead to a doping of the host. Above 200 K, an exponential increase of σ is observed. The increase in σ is accompanied by an increase in εr from 7 to more than 100 at low frequencies. Such a frequency behaviour can be associated with ion migration effectively contributing to electrical transport. The activation energy of Ea = 0.46 eV obtained from temperature-dependent measurements of σ is related to the increase of the ionic diffusion coefficient with temperature, comparable with ion migration studies of other perovskite compositions.46–49 The effect of ion migration is also observed by measuring current–voltage (I–V) characteristics (Fig. S10, ESI†) of the same single crystal device. By changing the operating conditions, sweep rate or polarity of the voltage, different shapes for the I–V curves are obtained due to the occurrence of hysteresis. This phenomena is widely observed in the field of perovskite solar cells50–52 and has recently also been discovered for a MAPbBr3 single crystal device,53 highlighting in all of them the major contribution of ion migration to the formation of current–voltage hysteresis. The characteristic frequency dependence observed in εr further supports this assignment,54 and the increase in low frequencies matches well with the behaviour found in other metal–halide perovskites.55,56 To our knowledge, no AC conductivity and permittivity values are reported for this perovskite system with a particular stoichiometry. Due to the single crystallinity of the perovskite, we can exclude a major contribution by grain boundaries as transport channels for ion migration and rather assign the observed activation energy to a bulk transport mechanism in the (FAPbI3)0.9(MAPbBr3)0.1 crystal.
Phase transitions, as observed for the perovskite α-FAPbI3, from a simple cubic symmetry to a ditetragonal dipyramidal system in the range of 285 K to 290 K57,58 and to a ditetragonal phase at around 140 K57–59 are not obvious from the dielectric measurements of the (FAPbI3)0.9(MAPbBr3)0.1 crystal. When passing through the temperature cycle, we could find only weak indications of structural changes as shown in Fig. S11 (ESI†). Here, tiny but abrupt changes of εr are visible at higher frequencies, where the signal contains less noise. A possible explanation for this jump could also be mechanical stress due to the applied temperature cycles, so that it is difficult to assign this behaviour to a phase transition.
Conclusions
In conclusion, we have established RFCM as a new method to grow stable, stoichiometric and large-sized (FAPbI3)0.9(MAPbBr3)0.1 single crystals of superior structural quality without need for seed crystals. We confirm the high degree of crystallinity of the crystal bulk and surface by means of transmission Laue diffraction and X-ray reflectometry, respectively. In contrast, crystals of the same composition but grown by the conventional seed crystal technique show higher textural imperfections when examined by out-of-plane reflectometry and rocking scans, although they are visually as perfect and have the same optical band-gap of Eg = 1.447 eV as the RFCM grown samples. Temperature and frequency dependent capacitance measurements on single crystal devices show a more than tenfold increase of the relative permittivity from 7 to above 100 which can be attributed to an ionic contribution to electrical transport. We rule out grain boundaries as main transport channels regarding the exceptional crystallinity of the samples and assign the electrical transport properties to the crystal bulk. The control and confirmation of the exact stoichiometry by complementary qualitative and quantitative measurements in combination with the determination of lowest structural as well as chemical defect density therefore impose fundamental requirements to unravel the optoelectronic properties of complex lead–halide perovskite systems.
