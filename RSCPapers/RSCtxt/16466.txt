    , Accepted 27th April 2017First published on 28th April 2017AbstractIn this work, we present a new strategy to use fused and twisted conjugated backbones to construct conjugated small molecules and polymers as electron acceptors for non-fullerene solar cells. The new conjugated materials containing binary perylene bisimide (PBI) units linked with coplanar thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (as trans-PBI) or twisted thieno[2,3-b]thiophene (as cis-PBI) and the corresponding conjugated polymer cis-polyPBI were developed. A fused conjugated backbone ensures good charge transport, in which the twisted polymer cis-polyPBI was found to show the highest electron mobility of 1.2 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 in field-effect transistors. Meanwhile, a twisted conjugated backbone effectively prevents the aggregation and crystallization of PBI units, resulting in isotropic charge transport and finely tuned micro-phase separation in bulk-heterojunction thin films. The high electron mobility and isotropic crystallinity make the fused and twisted electron acceptors achieve high power conversion efficiencies above 6% in non-fullerene solar cells, while the coplanar molecule trans-PBI as the electron acceptor shows a very low efficiency of 0.13%.
Introduction
Non-fullerene organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted tremendous attention in recent years with the rapidly increasing power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) from 3%1–5 to 12%,6–16 surpassing the performance of traditional OSCs based on fullerene derivatives as electron acceptors.17 This great achievement in such a short time is partially due to the innovation of novel conjugated electron acceptors, focusing on optimizing absorption, energy levels, crystalline properties and charge transport. Among them, conjugated small molecules represent the most successful electron acceptor due to the vast electron-deficient building blocks.8,12,14,15,18–20 In contrast, the study of conjugated polymers as electron acceptors is somehow lagging behind small molecules, although the PCEs of polymer–polymer solar cells are close to 9%.21–25
When designing conjugated polymers as electron acceptors, two aspects are required to be considered: high electron mobility and finely tuned micro-phase separation.26 In bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells, high and balanced hole and electron mobilities are beneficial for charge separation and transport in order to reduce charge recombination.27,28 A well-known strategy to achieve high electron mobility of conjugated polymers is to improve the crystalline properties, for example, by using a rigid conjugated backbone.29,30 However, in BHJ solar cells containing binary components, rigid conjugated polymers tend to form self-assembled structures with a large domain size, resulting in poor micro-phase separation between the donor and acceptor.26 It has been reported that the domain size around 10–20 nm in BHJ systems is optimal for exciton diffusion and charge transport,31 so the large domain size caused by the highly crystalline polymer acceptors will significantly limit the photovoltaic performance. From these aspects, it seems to be a difficult task to spontaneously realize high electron mobility and optimized micro-phase separation of BHJ systems in a single conjugated polymer acceptor.
In this work, we intend to solve the contradiction between mobility and micro-phase separation in polymer–polymer solar cells via designing new conjugated polymer acceptors. Our idea initiated from some studies about field-effect transistors (FETs) by us and others, in which some asymmetric or less crystalline conjugated polymers still obtained high mobility, indicating that conjugated materials with irregular structures are able to achieve good charge transport.32–35 Therefore, we select the monomers containing two electron-deficient perylene bisimides (PBIs)8,36–39 fused with thiophene derivatives, as shown in Fig. 1. This kind of fused structure can efficiently enhance the crystalline properties and π-conjugation length of molecules so as to improve the charge carrier mobility, which have also been applied in non-fullerene solar cells (Table S1, ESI†).8,16,40–45 In particular, Marks et al. developed several fused PBI molecules, in which they found that a twisted backbone from thiophene could result in high performance solar cells, while planar PBI molecules from thienothiophene (TT) could significantly reduce the device performance due to large micro-phase separation.40 Inspired by these studies, we selected TT that has trans- and cis-conformation to construct PBI molecules, in which the cis-structure with the twisted backbone was able to reduce the aggregate tendency of the conjugated materials. The resulting polymer acceptor, cis-polyPBI (Fig. 1), was developed to show an electron mobility of 1.2 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 in FETs and a PCE of 6.3% with a high open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.01 V in polymer–polymer solar cells. Morphology analysis by grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) reveals that cis-PBI and cis-polyPBI have isotropic crystalline properties, having a negligible influence on the crystallization of the donor polymer in BHJ thin films. This was further confirmed by resonant soft X-ray scattering (R-SoXS), revealing that cis-PBI and cis-polyPBI based blended thin films showed large crystal domain size and high domain purity, explaining the high photocurrent and fill factor in solar cells. These results illustrate that the design by using twisted and fused conjugated backbones is an efficient route to construct conjugated polymer acceptors toward high performance non-fullerene solar cells.

Results and discussion
Synthesis of the monomers and polymers
The synthetic routes for the PBI-based small molecules and polymers are presented in Scheme 1 and their detailed experimental procedures are summarized in the ESI.† Starting from the mono-bromine substituted PBI units (1 or 2) with swallow-tail C5 or C11 alkyl side groups,46 the bis-PBI precursors cis-PBI or 4 can be achieved by using 2,5-bis(trimethylstannyl)thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (3)47via the Stille cross coupling reaction. After sunlight irradiation with I2 as an initiator at room temperature and bromination by using Br2, the dibromo-substituted PBI monomer M1 can be easily obtained. We observed the isomers of M1 from NMR spectra with the estimated ratio of 3:2,48 as shown in the ESI,† NMR spectra section. We were unable to separate the two isomers by using column chromatography due to their similar polarity, so M1 with isomers was directly used for polymerization. The PBI-based conjugated polymer cis-polyPBI was achieved via the Stille polymerization. The polymer was well-dissolved in CHCl3, THF and chlorobenzene (CB). The molecular weight of the polymer was determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) with ortho-dichlorobenzene as the eluent at 140 °C. cis-PolyPBI provided a reasonable number-average molecular weight (Mn) of 18.4 kg mol−1 with a molar-mass dispersity (ĐM) of 1.98 (Fig. S1†). The molecule trans-PBI was synthesized according to literature procedures.40 Both the PBI-based small molecules and polymers show good thermal stability with 5% weight loss above 300 °C, as determined by thermogravimetry (TGA) measurement (Fig. S2a, ESI† and Table 1). We also measure the thermal properties of PBI-based small molecules and polymers by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), but no melting and crystalline peak can be observed (Fig. S2b–d†). This is possibly due to the fused conjugated PBI backbone, resulting in no melting transition before the decomposition of the small molecules and polymers.

Absorption spectra and energy levels
Absorption spectra of PBI small molecules and the polymer in chloroform and in thin films are shown in Fig. 2 and the data is summarized in Table 1. These materials show slightly red-shifted absorption in thin films compared to those in CHCl3. trans-PBI has an optical band gap (Eg) of 2.11 eV in thin films, while cis-PBI has a higher Eg of 2.19 eV. cis-PolyPBI has a slightly reduced Eg of 2.03 eV, indicating that the inter-charge transfer between cis-PBI and thiophene is weak.

The energy levels of the molecules and polymers were determined by cyclic voltammetry measurement, as shown in Fig. S2e† and Table 1. trans-PBI has the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels of −5.85 eV and −3.75 eV, while cis-PBI shows HOMO and LUMO levels of −5.93 eV and −3.74 eV. The results indicate that the LUMO levels of the PBI molecules are mainly determined by PBI units. The polymer acceptor cis-polyPBI has HOMO and LUMO levels of −5.82 and −3.79 eV.
The molecular geometry of cis- and trans-PBI is analyzed by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, as shown in Fig. 3. trans-PBI has a coplanar backbone, while cis-PBI has a twisted backbone with a dihedral angle of 28.7°. Meanwhile, the two molecules show the well-localized HOMO and LUMO levels along the conjugated backbone, which originated from the fused conjugated backbone. This is different from the twisted PBI molecules, such as the PBI dimer s-diPBI, in which the LUMO level is mainly positioned on PBI units.46 It was speculated that the localized frontier energy levels were helpful for stabilizing electron and improving carrier mobilities.

Field-effect transistors
The charge transport properties of the PBI materials were evaluated by FETs with the bottom gate–bottom contact (BGBC) device configuration. The detailed fabrication procedures are summarized in the ESI.† The transfer and output characteristics are shown in Fig. 4 and the charge transport parameters are summarized in Table 2. The molecule trans-PBI had an electron mobility of 8.6 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 with a threshold voltage (VT) of 9.9 V and a high on/off ratio of 1 × 106. The twisted molecule cis-PBI was found to have a slightly low electron mobility of 3.2 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, which can be due to low crystallinity. Interestingly, the conjugated polymer cis-polyPBI showed the highest electron mobility of 1.2 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 in FETs, which is comparable to fullerene derivatives.49 This finding reveals that PBI based conjugated molecules with a twisted backbone are able to realize high electron mobilities.

Non-fullerene solar cells
PBI-based small molecules and the polymer as electron acceptors were applied in non-fullerene solar cells, in which a wide band gap polymer PBDB-T50 with complementary absorption (Fig. 2) was used as the electron donor. We also show the energy levels of the donor polymer PBDB-T in Table 1, with HOMO and LUMO levels of −5.33 and −3.53 eV. The difference of HOMO and LUMO between the donor and acceptor is close to or above 0.3 eV, which is sufficient for charge separation.51 The solar cells use inverted device configuration with ITO/ZnO and MoO3/Ag as electrodes. The photoactive layers of PBDB-T:PBI were solution-processed from CB, in which a small amount of 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) is helpful to improve the device performance (Tables S2–S4, ESI†). The J–V characteristics of the solar cells are shown in Fig. 5a and the solar cells’ performance is summarized in Table 3. We fabricated photovoltaic devices by using optimizing conditions, and the results show good reproducibility (Tables S5–S7, ESI†).

PBDB-T:trans-PBI solar cells exhibit a very low PCE of 0.13% with a low short circuit current density (Jsc) of 0.42 mA cm−2, a Voc of 1.10 V and a low FF of 0.29. The PCE was significantly enhanced to 7.6% for cis-PBI based solar cells due to a high Jsc of 11.9 mA cm−2, an FF of 0.64 and a slightly reduced Voc of 1.00 V. Solar cells based on cis-polyPBI as the electron acceptor have a PCE of 6.3% with a Jsc of 10.3 mA cm−2, a Voc of 1.01 V and an FF of 0.60, which is slightly reduced compared to cis-PBI based cells. Jscs are also reflected by their external quantum efficiencies (EQE) as shown in Fig. 5b. Solar cells based on PBDB-T:trans-PBI have very low quantum efficiencies, while EQE of cis-PBI and cis-polyPBI based cells can enhance to 0.70 and 0.60 with photo-response from 300 to 700 nm. Notably, the trans-PBI based conjugated polymer trans-polyPBI was also prepared in this work, but the molecular weight of the polymer is very low (Mn of 2.3 kg mol−1 with a ĐM of 1.29), corresponding to the repeating units less than three (Part 6 in the ESI†). We are also able to fabricate solar cells based on PBDB-T:trans-polyPBI, resulting in a PCE of 2.6% with a Jsc of 6.0 mA cm−2, a Voc of 1.02 V and an FF of 0.41 (Fig. S3, ESI†). trans-PolyBI based cells show significantly improved PCEs compared to trans-PBI based cells, but are still less than those of cis-PBI and cis-polyPBI.
Morphology investigation
We further analyzed the morphology of photoactive layers by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and GIWAXS. All of the three photoactive layers show a smooth surface with small roughness in the AFM images (Fig. S4, ESI†), which makes it difficult to distinguish the morphology difference in these systems. Therefore, we further apply GIWAXS to study the micro-phase separation, as shown in Fig. 6. As predicted, trans-PBI is highly crystalline as evidenced by the distinct (h00) diffraction peaks up to the third order in the out-of-plane direction (Fig. 6a). In comparison, cis-PBI has amorphous microstructures in thin films with broad (100) and (010) peaks (Fig. 6b) in the out-of-plane and in-plane directions, which is similar to that of the fullerene derivative, [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM).52 The crystalline properties are slightly enhanced for the polymer cis-polyPBI due to the high (100) and (010) diffraction peaks in the out-of-plane diffraction (Fig. 6c), suggesting that the conjugated backbone of cis-polyPBI performs in mixed “edge-on” and “face-on” orientations in thin films. This mixed π–π stacking direction for cis-PBI and cis-polyPBI indicates the isotropic charge transport in BHJ thin films toward a high photocurrent.53 The blended PBDB-T:trans-PBI presents an amorphous morphology, lacking the crystal packing both from PBDB-T12 and trans-PBI (Fig. 6d). Interestingly, less crystalline and isotropic cis-PBI and cis-polyPBI have a low impact on the crystallization of PBDB-T in blended thin films, as confirmed by the identical GIWAXS patterns of PBDB-T:cis-PBI and PBDB-T:cis-polyPBI with the pure polymer PBDB-T thin film (Fig. 6e and f).12 GIWAXS results confirm that fused but twisted PBI-based acceptors can provide isotropic crystallization in thin films, resulting both in isotropic charge transport and little impact on the crystallization of donor polymers.

We further analyzed the micro-phase separation in blended thin films by the contrast-enhanced technique R-SoXS,19 as shown in Fig. 7 and Table 4. The blended PBDB-T:trans-PBI thin film shows a small domain size of 8.4 nm and a low domain purity of 0.35, while the domain size and domain purity were enhanced to 14.7 nm, 0.62 for PBDB-T:cis-PBI and 20.2 nm, 1 for PBDB-T:cis-polyPBI. The high domain size and domain purity in blended thin films are consistent with the results from GIWAXS, which is helpful to reduce the rate of bimolecular recombination, explaining high photocurrent and FF in cis-PBI and cis-polyPBI based solar cells.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we develop a series of PBI conjugated small molecules and polymers as electron acceptors for non-fullerene solar cells, in which the conjugated backbone was designed as fused and twisted structures. We found that by using binary PBI units fused with the twisted thieno[2,3-b]thiophene building block, the molecule cis-PBI and cis-polyPBI can realize high electron mobilities and meanwhile maintain isotropic crystallinity in thin films, while the coplanar PBI molecule trans-PBI constructed from planar thieno[3,2-b]thiophene shows slightly low electron mobility and highly crystalline properties. As a result, organic solar cells based on cis-PBI and cis-polyPBI as electron acceptors exhibit high PCEs of 7.6% and 6.3%, while trans-PBI based cells only provided a low PCE of 0.13%. The significantly improved performance in cis-PBI and cis-polyPBI based cells was found to originate from the balanced hole and electron mobility, and the optimized micro-phase separation with a large crystal domain size and domain purity in blended thin films. The results show that the design of introducing fused and twisted backbones in conjugated materials is an efficient method to realize both high electron mobility and optimized morphology toward high performance non-fullerene solar cells.
