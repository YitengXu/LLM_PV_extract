    , Accepted 6th May 2015First published on 6th May 2015AbstractBulk compounds, prepared via the ceramic route, related to Cu2ZnSnSe4 (CZTSe), a material considered for use in photovoltaic devices, were investigated using NMR spectroscopy, electron-probe microanalyses and X-ray diffraction. These materials adopt the kesterite structure regardless of the Cu and Zn contents. It is also shown that the stability domain of the copper-poor quaternary phases is wider for selenide derivatives than for sulphides. Finally, the Cu/Zn disorder level in CZTSe is found to be higher when the samples are quenched, which is reminiscent of the behaviour of the parent sulphide compounds CZTS.
Compared to silicon-based technologies thin film-based solar cells are expected to save materials and to have a shorter energy payback time. Copper zinc tin chalcogenide materials (Cu2ZnSnQ4, Q = S or/and Se, noted CZTS, CZTSe or CZTSSe) are extensively investigated as potential photovoltaic absorbers for such thin-film solar cells.1–3 These materials contain non-toxic and earth abundant elements and the corresponding CZTSSe-based solar cells have been found so far to reach energy conversion efficiencies of up to 12.6%.4 The best performances have always been obtained for Cu-poor compounds5 containing both sulfur and selenium.6 Secondary phases should be avoided in high-performance cells. Thus, it is essential to understand the extent of the CZTQ phase stability domain in the Cu2Q–ZnQ–SnQ2 ternary diagram in detail.
Such investigation has already been carried out on pure sulphide compounds through a solid state chemistry approach built upon X-ray diffraction and NMR spectroscopy.7,8 So far, two main substitution processes have been considered to account for the charge balance in Cu-poor CZTS materials, namely, the A-type substitution 2Cu → VCu + ZnCu (with a formulation of Cu2−2aZn1+aSnS4) and the B-type substitution 2Cu + Sn → 2ZnCu + ZnSn (Cu2−2bZn1+3bSn1−bS4). The main result of this previous study was that the lowest copper content in Cu-poor CZTS compounds (Cu1.705Zn1.185Sn0.98S4) is achieved when A- and B-type defects (AB-substitution) coexist.9
The crystal structure of CZTS compounds has been intensively studied because of its potential influence on the electronic properties of these semiconductors. On the other hand the crystal structure of the selenide series is still open.
In this communication, we present both the NMR investigation of the local crystal structure and a detailed study of the phase stability boundaries of CZTSe in the copper-poor, zinc-rich compositions. Additionally, these compounds have been investigated using both powder and single crystal X-ray diffraction. These results are compared to those reported for the sulphide derivatives.
Experimental
The studied samples (see Table 1) have been synthesized via the ceramic method from elemental precursors heated at 750 °C in evacuated, sealed, and fused silica tubes (see the ESI†). In order to investigate the Cu/Zn disorder in CZTSe compounds, some samples underwent specific thermal treatments after synthesis. Hence, two new samples have been obtained from sample A2, A2Q (quenched) and A2S (slow cooled) after annealing at 350 °C for 2 days.

The sample homogeneity was checked using powder X-ray diffraction and the unit cell parameters of the compounds were obtained by the refinement of the corresponding patterns using the Le Bail method (full pattern matching mode) using the Jana2006 program.10 The chemical compositions of the studied samples were accurately determined by Electron-Probe MicroAnalyses (EPMA) on polished sections.
For the structure analysis, a single crystal suitable for X-ray diffraction was picked up from the sample S3 which is not strictly stoichiometric. However, during the structure refinement the composition of the chosen single crystal appeared to be very close to that of the Cu2ZnSnSe4.
In a previous study solid state NMR spectroscopy was shown to be a powerful tool to investigate the local structure in CZTS materials.11 So, 65Cu and 119Sn NMR investigations were performed on the studied selenide CZTSe samples. Additionally, the Raman spectra were recorded at 514.5 nm excitation wavelength in the back scattering configuration on a high resolution spectrometer. Attention was paid to the power density of the incident laser which was adjusted to avoid any modification on the recorded spectra.
Details about the experimental conditions for all the used characterization techniques are given in the ESI.†
Results and discussion
Crystal structure
After much controversy, it is now well established that CZTS materials crystallize with the kesterite (KS) structure (I space group), in its ordered or disordered forms depending on prior thermal treatments.7,12 In the case of the selenide derivative, Cu2ZnSnSe4, the first crystal investigations were ascribed to the stannite structure (I2m space group).13,14 Formally, the main difference between these two polymorphs, both deriving from the ZnS–sphalerite structure type, is related to the occupation of the 2a Wyckoff position ((000) coordinates) by Cu in kesterite and Zn in stannite. Consequently, there are two distinct crystallographic sites for copper in kesterite (2a and 2c) while there is only one in stannite (4d). Recently, Nateprov et al.15 concluded that the actual crystal structure of Cu2ZnSnSe4 is kesterite. Although the conclusion turned out to be correct, this study appears to suffer from a lack of precision (see ESI†), so we decided to reinvestigate the crystal structure of the stoichiometric Cu2ZnSnSe4. Even though it is difficult to distinguish between Cu and Zn using conventional X-ray diffraction, our data show that the kesterite structure (more precisely, the disordered-kesterite, see the Cu/Zn disorder section) is the most representative model. Our measured residual factors, R(obs)/wR(obs), are 3.06/10.97 and 2.75/9.94 for stannite and kesterite, respectively (411 observed unique reflections and 14 refined parameters in the I2m space group). Details about this structure investigation are given in the ESI.† (CCDC 1054041).
The correctness of the proposed structural model for Cu2ZnSnSe4 is strongly supported by the 65Cu NMR investigation. Indeed, the 65Cu static NMR spectrum of the sample (Fig. 1) can be efficiently fitted by wide (W, CQ = 5.5 MHz) and narrow (N, CQ = 1.5 MHz) lines with line shapes reflecting both the chemical shift and the quadrupolar interactions. All the experimental values of the NMR parameters are gathered in Fig. 1. From the single crystal structure refinement presented above, the 2a site appears to be much more distorted than the 2c site, leading to a larger Electric Field Gradient (EFG) at the 2a site and therefore, to a larger CQ. Thus, the lines W and N are assigned to the 2a and the 2c sites, respectively. This attribution is supported by the values of the quadrupolar coupling, CQ = 5.8 MHz/ηQ = 0 for the 2a site and CQ = 1.8 MHz/ηQ = 0 for the 2c site, obtained from DFT calculations carried out on a hypothetical ordered kesterite structure.16 In addition, the two spectral NMR lines have the same intensity which agrees perfectly with the 2-fold multiplicity of the 2 copper sites within the kesterite structure and definitively rebuts the stannite structure.
 Fig. 1  
65Cu static NMR (blue) with spectral decomposition (red) for Cu2ZnSnSe4 compound in 2 individual lines (purple). The NMR parameters are CQ = 5.5 MHz, ηQ = 0, δiso = 600 ppm, δaniso = −183 ppm, ηδ = 0 and β = 2° for line W and CQ = 1.5 MHz, ηQ = 0, δiso = 596 ppm, δaniso = 95 ppm, ηδ = 0 and β = 0° for line N (details in ESI†). 
A similar 65Cu static NMR investigation has been performed for a Cu-poor Zn-rich selenide compound (sample A2) also showing a 2-component spectrum (see Fig. S1 in the ESI†). This result clearly suggests that the whole CZTSe compounds adopt the kesterite crystal structure, Cu at 2 distinguishable sites, regardless of their actual compositions.
Quaternary phase stability domain
Dudchak et al.17 have deeply investigated the phase equilibria in the Cu2Se–ZnSe–SnSe2 system but they do not focus specifically on the Cu2ZnSnSe4 compound.
A large set of samples was prepared and most of them did not appear to be homogeneous. The analyses were performed only on the grains corresponding to quaternary phases. Because the target compositions were far from the stoichiometry of Cu2ZnSnSe4, the phase stability boundaries of the quaternary CZTSe are expected to be reached. The target and average compositions of these samples determined from microprobe analyses are gathered in Table 1 and represented in the pseudo-ternary Cu2Se/ZnSe/SnSe2 diagram in Fig. 2.
 Fig. 2  Stability domain of the copper-poor quaternary kesterite phases in the Cu2Se–ZnSe–SnSe2 diagram. The full red circles indicate the targeted compositions and the black crosses the average compositions of the corresponding quaternary phases. The targeted composition for S1, S2 and S3 is the stoichiometric Cu2ZnSnS4 (S full red circle). 
The above presented substitution processes (A and B) are indicated by dashed lines in Fig. 2.
Moreover, we propose to introduce here, based on experimental investigations, a new substitution type named E-type that differs from A, B, C and D types discussed in a previous paper.9 Namely, this new substitution process would consist of the replacement of two Cu and one Zn cations by one Sn cation with the appearance of two copper vacancies (2Cu +Zn → 2VCu + SnZn) leading to the overall Cu2−2eZn1−eSn1+eSe4 formulation (vertical straight line in the ternary diagram). Then, a composition above the horizontal A line in Fig. 2 (Sn-rich side) can be viewed as a combination of the A and E substitutions leading to a general Cu2−2a−2eZn1+a−eSn1+eSe4 formulation.
The limits of the studied stability diagram correspond to the following compositions: Cu1.59Zn1.17Sn1.01Se4 (sample AE2, A + E-type), Cu1.94Zn1.15Sn0.97Se4 (sample AB1-2, B-type) and Cu1.64Zn1.29Sn0.945Se4 (sample A3, A + B-type).
Clearly, the stability domain of the CZTSe phase extends to the Sn-rich region (light grey in Fig. 2), a region rarely discussed and that would probably deserve further investigations not reported here.
Cu/Zn disorder
Let us now present the study of the Cu/Zn disorder in CZTSe via local probe measurements. In the kesterite structure, the two cationic sites at z = 1/4 and z = 3/4, namely the 2c and 2d Wyckoff positions, are crystallographically very similar. In the fully ordered kesterite structure Cu and Zn atoms are located on the 2c and 2d sites, respectively. This distribution can be perturbed according to the thermal history of the sample. If the cationic distribution is fully random (site occupancies of 50% for Cu and Zn on both sites) the structure becomes a fully disordered kesterite (dis-KS) with a higher symmetry18 (i.e. I2m instead of I, see Fig. S2, ESI†). The single crystal structure of the stoichiometric CZTSe (vide supra) has been refined using the dis-KS model.
The influence of the cooling procedure at the end of the sample preparation on the Cu/Zn disorder has been investigated with the help of 119Sn NMR spectroscopy as well as Raman spectroscopy. This investigation was restricted to the quenched and slow cooled samples prepared with an actual Cu1.751Zn1.196Sn0.957Se4 composition (samples A2Q and A2S). At the very first sight, the impact of the cooling procedure was directly visible on the powder diffraction pattern, for the c/a ratios are 1.9938(1) and 1.99120(6) for A2Q and A2S, respectively. This trend, a higher c/a ratio when the sample is quenched, was already noticed for the CZTS materials.8

Fig. 3 shows the 119Sn MAS NMR spectra of samples A2Q and A2S. In agreement with the results previously obtained on sulphide compounds, the spectrum A2S consists of two resonances. The main resonance at −592 ppm is associated with the ordered kesterite structure of Cu2ZnSnSe4 whereas the second at −544 ppm is associated with Sn atoms experiencing Cu vacancies in their second coordination shell. For the quenched sample (A2Q) both the 119Sn (Fig. 3) and 65Cu (Fig. S1 in the ESI†) NMR spectra are broadened. The latter becomes featureless even if the two Cu resonances of the KS structure are still distinguishable. In addition, an asymmetric broadening, as well as a slight right shift (∼−12 ppm), of the two 119Sn resonances is observed. This reflects an isotropic chemical shift distribution coming from a distribution of 119Sn environments due to the existence of geometric (angles and distances) and chemical disorders.

These observations can be correlated to the high level of the Cu/Zn disorder, in the quenched sample, as it was proposed for the parent sulphide compounds.11
Finally, the Cu/Zn disorder has been tracked through Raman spectroscopy on the same A2Q and A2S samples. The corresponding spectra are shown in Fig. S3 in the ESI.† In agreement with the literature,19–21 the main peaks of the slow cooled sample are found to be at 168, 172 and 195 cm−1. There is a slight peak shift toward low frequencies for the quenched sample, but the main effect going from slow cooled to quenched samples concerns the peak broadening. These observations agree perfectly with a recent study on the Cu/Zn disorder in CZTSe thin films which pointed out an order–disorder transition temperature of about 200 °C.22
Conclusion: comparison with sulphides
The above presented results are reminiscent of those for sulphide CZTS compounds.8 In particular (i) the kesterite structure is the preferred structure for CZTS and CZTSe compounds, (ii) 65Cu NMR is not very sensitive to the actual composition, (iii) 119Sn NMR can be used to monitor the presence of copper vacancies, and (iv) 65Cu and 119Sn NMR as well as Raman spectroscopy are highly dependent on the Cu/Zn disorder level.
The main difference between 119Sn spectra for sulphides and selenides is the overall line shift of about 470 ppm due to the replacement of S by Se (see Fig. S4, ESI†).
In our previous NMR investigations on sulphide compounds, we introduced the actual number (N) of Sn atoms affected per Cu vacancy;8 the Cu-vacancy content is deduced from the measured composition. From the determination of a value of N close to 2 (rather than 4 as expected for isolated A-type complexes), we concluded to the propensity of A-type complexes to segregate in CZTS. We applied the same approach for samples A2S and A2Q and found N values close to 1 (N equals to ∼1 and ∼0.8 for A2S and A2Q, respectively). Such values are very unlikely because they would correspond to a severe aggregation of the A-type complexes which could lead to strong local distortions of the crystallographic structure. In our opinion, these low values rather suggest that our previous assumption that VCu is located only at the 2a site, is not fulfilled anymore in selenide compounds. Further work, coupling NMR and X-ray investigations, is needed to address this point.
The differences in cation compensation between sulphides and selenides might be related to the difference in the extent of their phase domain stability. Indeed, as shown in Fig. 4, larger shifts from the nominal stoichiometric Cu2ZnSnQ4 (Q = S or Se) are observed for selenides. Thus one can conclude that selenides are much more flexible to be more copper-poor, zinc rich than sulphides. This result could be related to the enhancement of photovoltaic performances when S is partially replaced by Se in CZTSSe.
