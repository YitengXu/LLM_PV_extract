    , Accepted 24th January 2018First published on 26th January 2018AbstractAn efficient photoelectrochemical water splitting system is developed based on a hierarchical TiO2 nanowire/microflower (H-TiO2) photoanode, which is synthesized via a one-step hydrothermal process. The H-TiO2 structure is formed via three primary self-assembly processes and simultaneously offers excellent ultraviolet light absorption capacity and large specific surface area. The H-TiO2 photoanode achieves a 1.3 fold enhancement in photocurrent density compared to its TiO2 nanowire-based counterpart at 1.23 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (the theoretical potential for water electrolysis). More strikingly, by incorporating the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effect from Au nanoparticles (NPs), the resulting Au/H-TiO2-based photoanodes (Au/H-TiO2) exhibit an about two-fold enhancement in photocurrent density under both simulated sunlight and visible-light illumination. Moreover, the maximum photoconversion efficiency of Au/H-TiO2 gives three fold enhancement compared to that in the absence of Au NPs. Significantly, Au NPs incorporated on the H-TiO2 surface also serve as co-catalysts like Pt under white-light illumination, reducing the onset potential by about 0.15 V and the current saturation potential by about 0.18 V. The enhanced photoactivity under white light is due to the co-action of electron transfer from the efficient carrier separation of H-TiO2 (ultraviolet part) and Au to H-TiO2 under the SPR effect (visible part). The present study provides a new strategy for designing and fabricating TiO2-based devices with favorable energy conversion efficiency for photoelectrochemical water splitting.
Introduction
Natural photosynthesis is a process, in which green plants capture and convert solar energy into available chemical fuels and O2 using atmospheric CO2 as a carbon feedstock.1–5 This natural phenomenon has been motivating various artificial photosynthesis schemes including solar water splitting into H2 and O2 in an environmentally benign manner.6–11 Since the pioneering work in the early 1970s,12 much progress has been made in photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting on metal oxide semiconductor materials.4,13,14 In general, the PEC cell is used as a platform to directly extract electrical current on photoelectrode surfaces under light irradiation without measuring the gas production,15,16 and the activities of photoelectrodes can be assessed by measuring the photocurrent density in PEC water splitting.17,18 Among the semiconductor photocatalytic materials for PEC water splitting, TiO2 remains as the most attractive candidate owing to its superior photocorrosion resistance, low cost, and convenient preparation methods.8,19,20
Up to now, substantial attention has been paid to explore new morphologies and architectures of TiO2 in contrast to conventional nanoparticles (NPs) for the purpose of achieving enhanced PEC performances.4,21–23 From this prospect, one-dimensional (1D) TiO2 photoelectrodes, such as nanorods (NRs) or nanowires (NWs), exhibit a direct transport pathway shining the hope of enhanced charge transport efficiency. However, these array-based 1D TiO2 photoelectrodes do not show significantly enhanced charge transport rates or energy conversion efficiency due to their relatively small specific surface area, hence impeding light harvesting efficiency.8 Recently, three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical flower-like TiO2 architectures have been widely probed for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs).24,25 In this case, the 3D mesostructured TiO2 such as microflowers can increase the active surface area as well as the number of active sites; meanwhile, they usually serve as scattering layers to improve the light absorption capacity.26 However, the synthetic process of these mesostructured TiO2 photoelectrodes often requires the use of surfactants or templates, which may introduce unintended impurities and make it too tedious and expensive to obtain these photocatalysts.27 Moreover, it is indispensable for thoroughly understanding the specific formation process for the controllable preparation of the 3D architecture.
In addition, as a typical wide-band gap (∼3.2 eV) semiconductor, TiO2 captures only ultraviolet (UV) light (ca. 5% of solar spectrum), which seriously limits the light harvesting efficiency.28 Various attempts have been made to extend the absorption edge of TiO2, such as non-metal doping,29 sensitization with dye molecules,30 and coupling TiO2 with small band-gap semiconductors.31,32 Recently, integration of noble metal NPs (Au, Ag, Cu) with TiO2 to enhance the visible-light photocatalytic activity of TiO2 has received much attention.33,34 Metal NPs have better photostability in comparison with small band-gap semiconductor quantum dots that often suffer from anodic photocorrosion.35 In addition, the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effect significantly promotes light harvesting;36,37 meanwhile, the formed semiconductor–metal junction at the metal/TiO2 interface favors separation of photogenerated charge carriers under UV light irradiation. Among these metal NPs, Au NPs are regarded as the most attractive candidate due to their good stability against oxidation.
Herein, we present a one-step hydrothermal approach to synthesize a hierarchical TiO2 nanowire/microflower (H-TiO2) photoanode on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrates without applying any surfactants or templates. Experimental results demonstrate that the morphology of the resulting H-TiO2 structure is closely related to the precursor concentration, which is formed through three primary self-assembly processes. When working as a PEC photoanode, the H-TiO2 photoanode achieves a 1.3 fold higher photocurrent density than its TiO2 NW-based counterpart under the same conditions. Moreover, deposition of Au NPs onto H-TiO2 further boosts light harvesting, and the resulting Au NPs deposited onto H-TiO2 (Au/H-TiO2-X) show enhanced PEC performance in the entire UV–visible region. The 3D architecture of H-TiO2 and incorporation of Au NPs contribute to the excellent PEC performance of Au/H-TiO2-based photoanodes.
Experimental
Chemicals and materials
Titanium isopropoxide (TTIP, C12H28O4Ti, 97%) and KOH were obtained from Aladdin. HAuCl4·4H2O and H2PtCI6·6H2O were purchased from Adamas-beta. Titanium butoxide (TB, C16H36O4Ti, 95%) was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. TiCl4 (98%), ethylene glycol (EG, C2H6O2), and concentrated hydrochloric acid (HCl, 36–38%) were supplied by Tianjin Zhiyuan Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. 2.2 mm thick FTO glass substrates (Nippon Sheet Glass, Japan) were cut into pieces of about 1 cm2. Ultrapure water (18.25 MΩ cm) was used throughout the experiment.
Preparation of TiO2 photoanodes
Rutile TiO2 photoanodes were grown on FTO substrates by adopting a previously reported method with minor optimization.38 Prior to the reaction, FTO substrates were ultrasonically cleaned in isopropanol, ethanol, and water for 30 min, followed by drying under a nitrogen flow. Then, HCl (30 mL) was added into water (30 mL) in a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave (100 mL volume). Three different kinds of titanium precursors (TTIP, TB, and TiCl4, with equal volume, i.e., 1 mL) were rapidly introduced into the above mixture after stirring for 10 min. The FTO substrates were transferred to the above autoclave after vigorous magnetic stirring for another 20 min. The hydrothermal reaction was performed at 160 °C for 6 h. After thorough cleaning, samples were annealed at 450 °C (air atmosphere) for another 1 h to improve the crystallinity of rutile TiO2 photoelectrodes.
Preparation of Au/H-TiO2-X photoanodes
A photochemical strategy at ambient temperature was employed to prepare Au/H-TiO2-X photoanodes. EG (0.5 mL) was diluted with water (20 mL) in a beaker (50 mL) and the solution was stirred for 10 min. Then, the EG solution was mixed with different volumes (5 μL, 10 μL, 20 μL, 40 μL, 60 μL; corresponding to X = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, respectively) of HAuCl4·4H2O (0.024 mol L−1). After stirring for another 20 min, H-TiO2 electrodes were put into the above solution and subjected to UV irradiation (365 nm, Au Light, Beijing, CEL-LED100) at an operating current of 3.5 A. After a period of irradiation of 10 min, the FTO substrates were cleaned extensively. Samples were then treated at 350 °C for another 4 h in air to deposit Au NPs onto the H-TiO2 surface.
Material characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected on an X-ray diffractometer (Bruker D8 Advance) at ambient atmosphere, scanned from 2θ = 10–90°. The morphology was determined using a scanning electron microscope (SEM, ZEISS SUPRA 55VP, Germany) and high resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM, JEM-2011 TEM, 200 kV). X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were recorded on a Thermo Scientific Escalab 250 using the C 1s peak at 284.6 eV as a reference. Ultraviolet-visible diffusion reflectance spectroscopy (UV-vis DRS) of all samples was performed on a Shimadzu SolidSpec-3700 DUV (BaSO4 as the standard reference). In this work, we have controlled all the samples at the same weight during the UV-vis DRS measurement.
PEC measurements
The PEC performances of all samples were evaluated using a three electrode configuration upon front side illumination using an electrochemical station (CHI 760 E). H-TiO2 or Au/H-TiO2-X is used as the photoanode (working electrode, WE), the Pt plate as the counter electrode (CE), and Ag/AgCl in saturated KCl (+0.197 V vs. normal hydrogen electrode, NHE) as the reference electrode (RE). KOH aqueous solution (1 M) was used as the electrolyte throughout the PEC measurements. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) measurements, I–t, electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) under light, and open-circuit photovoltage decay (OCPVD) were measured under white-light with a 300 W xenon lamp (Newport, TLS-300X). An additional band filter (λ > 420 nm) was added to perform the visible-light measurements. Incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was determined using a solar simulator (NBeT, HSX-UV300) coupled with an aligned monochromator (Omno151). An optical power meter (Model 1918-R, Newport) was used to measure the light intensity. In all measurements, “light off” and “light on” processes were controlled using a fast shutter. Removing and placing the shutter in front of the light source present the “light off” and “light on” processes, respectively.
Electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) measurements
ECSA = RfS, where S represents the actual surface area of the WE (in the present work, S = 0.6 cm2).39Rf is defined as the ratio of the double layer capacitance Cdl of the WE to that of the ideal smooth oxide electrode (a constant), that is, Rf = Cdl/(the constant). The Cdl is ascertained by measuring the cyclic voltammetry (CV) response versus scan rates (υ). In the present work, the scanning range of the CV stripping is 0–0.17 V vs. Ag/AgCl (1 M KOH solution). The values of υ are 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 150, and 200 mV s−1. A plot of current density difference (Δj) at 0.1 V vs. Ag/AgCl against υ results in a linear plot with a slope equal to the Cdl, where Δj = (ja − jc) and ja and jc represent the anodic and cathodic current densities, respectively. Accordingly, the slope in the Δj–υ plot is directly proportional to Rf and thus the ECSA.
Results and discussion
Three different nanostructures of TiO2, namely H-TiO2, TiO2 NWs, and disordered TiO2 NWs (D-TiO2), are compared to confirm the much improved PEC performance of H-TiO2. The morphologies of TiO2 are shown in Fig. 1. When using TB as the titanium precursor, TiO2 NWs with an average diameter of ca. 50 nm are obtained (Fig. 1a and b). H-TiO2 can be acquired through adding an equal volume of TTIP. The structure of the obtained H-TiO2 is composed of two parts. The top part consists of microflowers (an architecture composed of TiO2 NRs) and the bottom part contains oriented TiO2 NW arrays (Fig. 1c and d). The diameters of these TiO2 NRs and NWs are ca. 300 nm and 50 nm, respectively, and the length of TiO2 NWs is ca. 4 μm (inset in Fig. 1c). For PEC cells, the 3D structure is highly desired. When TiCl4 is introduced, D-TiO2 with partly linear and partly aggregated NWs is obtained (Fig. 1e and f). According to previous works,40 the different structural characteristics of titanium precursors contribute to these three distinct morphologies of TiO2. TB and TTIP are all organic titanium alkoxide precursors, but TB possesses larger alkoxy groups than TTIP. Therefore, faster hydrolysis and condensation processes occur when TTIP is used as the titanium source than when using TB, which leads to the formation of H-TiO2. By contrast, TiCl4 is a kind of inorganic titanium precursor, leading to a large amount of structural defects and the appearance of the disordered structure.

LSV and I–t were employed to investigate the PEC performance of these three TiO2 films. As shown in Fig. 2a and b, under the same test conditions, H-TiO2 exhibits the best PEC performance, achieving an ∼1.3 fold enhancement in photocurrent density compared to that of TiO2 NWs at 0.23 V vs. Ag/AgCl (1.23 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode, RHE; ERHE = EAg/AgCl + 0.059 pH + E0Ag/AgCl). Obviously, D-TiO2 shows poorer performance than H-TiO2 and TiO2 NWs due to its disordered structure.

The optical properties of these three TiO2 films were investigated by UV-vis DRS (Fig. 3). Among these three samples, H-TiO2 exhibits the highest light absorption in the UV region. The strong light absorption capacity favors the capture of more UV light and thus increases the number of photoinduced charge carriers involved in PEC reactions.41 In addition, for all photoanodes, the non-zero baseline at λ > 420 nm may be derived from the light absorption of the FTO substrate.8

Detailed precursor concentration-dependent experiments were also conducted (160 °C, 6 h) to investigate the specific formation process of the hierarchical TiO2 architecture. The FTO substrate remains transparent and no TiO2 NRs are observed when the volume of introduced TTIP is less than 0.4 mL (Fig. 4a). Fig. 4b–f show the SEM images that track the morphology evolution of TiO2. The addition of 0.4 mL TTIP results in the formation of negligible TiO2 NWs that are distributed parallel to the surface of FTO (Fig. 4b). Further increase of volume to 0.6 mL leads to the growth of TiO2 NWs approximately perpendicular to the FTO substrate (Fig. 4c). When increasing the introduced volume of TTIP to 0.7 mL and 0.8 mL, the shape of TiO2 NWs does not change significantly, while the diameter of TiO2 NWs increases (Fig. 4d and e). It is noteworthy that sporadic microflowers can be observed when the volume of TTIP is 0.9 mL, as shown in Fig. 4f. Moreover, when the microflowers become denser, the bottom TiO2 NWs become thinner. The underlying growth mechanism still needs further exploration. If the precursor volume is larger than 1 mL, a white TiO2 film begins to strip from the FTO substrate, which limits the applications of these catalysts. This may be attributed to fierce competition between the crystal growth and its dissolution in the supersaturated titanium precursor solution.38 Nonetheless, the above results show that the precursor concentration plays a pivotal role in tuning the morphology of the formed hierarchical TiO2 structures.

Based on the above SEM results, we propose a growth mechanism, which can be divided into three primary self-assembly processes: (1) the formation of TiO2 NWs at the bottom; (2) the growth of bottom TiO2 NWs; (3) the formation and gradual growth of top TiO2 microflowers. As shown in Fig. 5, in the first stage, the amount of TiO2 NWs is too low to support neighboring TiO2 NWs to stand up. Further increase in the amount of TTIP leads to rapid hydrolysis, and TiO2 NWs grow at an angle to the substrate surface. In the final stage, some of the TiO2 particles that cannot form TiO2 NWs during the rapid hydrolysis process will be “squeezed out” by the compacted TiO2 NWs. At the same time, some TiO2 NRs appear at the top part because the precursor solutions provide massive Ti ions. As there is no substrate to anchor these TiO2 NRs, these TiO2 particles will become nucleation centers and provide many sites for the growth of nanocrystals, such as the flower-like microspheres. The specific analysis of the formation process is beneficial to the controllable fabrication of this hierarchical TiO2 architecture.

Generally, ECSA can be used to evaluate the electrochemical performance of electrodes. A higher ECSA means a larger surface area as well as greater quality of catalytically active sites.42 Based on the measured CV results (Fig. S1†) and the related calculations (the detailed calculation process is presented in the ESI†), the sample has the biggest ECSA when the volume of introduced TTIP is 1 mL (Fig. 6), which is due to the presence of more active sites associated with the formation of microflowers. Accordingly, a larger ECSA favors efficient carrier collection, which thus accelerates the surface reaction process.

Furthermore, Au NPs serve as an example to reveal the influence of the SPR effect and semiconductor–metal junction on the PEC performance of H-TiO2. The XRD spectra of all samples were collected to determine the crystal structure (Fig. S2†). The XRD spectra match well with the standard spectrum of rutile TiO2 (JCPDS no. 21-1276).22 In addition, the strong (002) peak indicates that TiO2 is highly crystalline and grows perpendicular to the substrate. The absence of Au diffraction peaks (JCPDS no. 04-0784) is due to the inadequate amount of Au NPs which is below the detection limit of XRD. However, the existence of Au NPs is evidenced by HRTEM and XPS.
The HRTEM image collected from a typical TiO2 nanorod reveals two completely different sets of lattice fringes. The interplanar spacings of ca. 0.32 and 0.29 nm match the (110) and (001) planes of the rutile TiO2 (Fig. 7a), respectively, while the average d-spacing value of 0.23 nm agrees with the (111) plane of Au NPs. In addition, Au NPs and H-TiO2 are in close contact with each other, suggesting that strong interaction has been established between Au NPs and H-TiO2 during the post annealing process. The Au/Ti weight ratios of all samples are listed in Table S1.† The Au NPs loading amount increases gradually along with the increase of concentration of HAuCl4·4H2O precursor solution, which is beneficial for the PEC reaction conditions to be further optimized. Fig. 7b depicts the element-mapping analysis on a single TiO2 nanorod after the deposition of Au NPs. This image further evidences the existence and homogeneous distribution of Au particles on the TiO2 NRs.
 Fig. 7  (a) The HRTEM image and (b) the corresponding element-mapping images of O (red), Ti (green), and Au (blue) of Au/H-TiO2; XPS spectra of H-TiO2 and Au/H-TiO2: (c) Au 4f; (d) Ti 2p. 
XPS was applied to identify the surface composition of photoelectrodes. The binding energy (BE) peak located at 83.24 eV corresponds to the 4f7/2 orbital of metallic Au0. The negative shift (ca. 0.7 eV) of the BE of Au 4f7/2 compared with the standard BE of the bulk Au (Fig. 7c)43 and the positive shift (ca. 0.23 eV) of the BE of Ti 2p3/2 after Au NP loading (Fig. 7d) reveal the feasibility of electron transfer from H-TiO2 to Au NPs. These results confirm the close contact between Au NPs and H-TiO2, which is consistent with the HRTEM results.
Optical absorption is an indispensable factor for the PEC performance of photoelectrodes. As shown in Fig. S3,† pristine H-TiO2 shows an absorption edge around 410 nm, which is in accordance with its band gap (ca. 3.0 eV). In addition, after subtracting the light absorption of FTO substrates, Au/H-TiO2-X photoanodes exhibit visible-light response centered at about 550 nm, attributing to the SPR peak of Au NPs. Meanwhile, the intensity of SPR peaks considerably increases with increasing loading amount of Au NPs.
Several different approaches were employed to systematically estimate the PEC performance of these photoelectrodes. LSV measurements (Fig. 8a) are used to reveal the photocurrent density of the samples versus the applied potential. A dark scan from −1 to +0.55 V vs. Ag/AgCl shows a negligible background current, indicating that almost no chemical reaction occurs under dark conditions. Upon white-light irradiation, both pristine H-TiO2 and Au/H-TiO2-X show pronounced photocurrent response. In comparison with H-TiO2, Au/H-TiO2-X electrodes exhibit significantly larger photocurrent density. Among these Au/H-TiO2-X electrodes, the Au/H-TiO2-2 electrode achieves the highest photocurrent density, i.e., 1.99 mA cm−2 at 0.23 V vs. Ag/AgCl, which is roughly double that of the bare H-TiO2 (1.07 mA cm−2). In addition, for these Au/H-TiO2-X electrodes, the onset potential (−0.79 V vs. Ag/AgCl) is much lower than that of the bare H-TiO2 (−0.64 V vs. Ag/AgCl), which will reduce the applied potential needed to achieve the optimal photoconversion efficiency.19 In comparative tests (Fig. 9a and b), Pt/H-TiO2 shows similar properties to Au/H-TiO2 (the synthesis process of Pt/H-TiO2 is shown in the ESI,† the PEC measurement conditions of Pt/H-TiO2 are the same as those of the Au/H-TiO2-based system). In all cases, the composites show better PEC performance than H-TiO2, and the photocurrent intensity of Pt/H-TiO2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE is about 2.6 times higher than that of H-TiO2 (higher than Au/H-TiO2-2). In the present PEC system, water oxidation and reduction reactions occur at different photoelectrodes, thus Au or Pt loaded onto H-TiO2 mainly act as effective co-catalysts under white-light illumination (in which UV light activates the semiconductor H-TiO2), decreasing the activation energy (Ea) of water oxidation and reducing the onset potential.

The intensity of the white-light is 100 mW cm−2.

Significantly, the negative shift of the onset potential also suggests excellent water oxidation kinetics and lower band bending required for the separation of photoinduced carriers after the deposition of Au NPs.23,44 The result confirms that the deposition of Au NPs on H-TiO2 facilitates the following reactions.
At the photoanode (WE): 4OH−(aq) → 2H2O(l) + 4e− + O2(g)(1)
At the Pt electrode (CE): 4H2O(l) + 4e− → 4OH−(aq) + 2H2(g)(2)
In addition, I–t measurements were performed at 1.23 V vs. RHE (a potential usually used as a metric to estimate the PEC activities of photoanodes) with 100 s light on/off cycles under both white-light and visible-light illumination (λ > 420 nm, 55.36 mW cm−2) to evaluate the photoresponse of electrodes.4,45 The values of recorded photocurrent density are concordant with those obtained from the LSV measurements (Fig. 8b), indicating that the photocurrent is very stable without the photocorrosion effect.7,46 More impressively, the photocurrent densities of Au/H-TiO2-X electrodes vary gradually with the increase of Au precursor concentrations. In all of the tested electrodes, the Au/H-TiO2-2 electrode generates the highest photocurrent density. Further raising the deposition amount of Au NPs leads to a reduced photocurrent density. Presumably, this phenomenon could be due to the following reasons. First, after incorporating Au NPs on H-TiO2, when the weight ratio of Au to Ti is lower than 0.261%, the formed semiconductor–metal junction during the Fermi level equilibration and the SPR effect of Au NPs all contribute to the enhanced PEC performance of Au/H-TiO2. However, when the weight ratio of Au to Ti is higher than 0.261%, excessive Au NPs may cover part of the H-TiO2 surface, blocking the entry of simulated solar light and then reducing the photogenerated charge carriers;47,48 these excessive Au NPs may act as trap centers, making photogenerated charge carriers recombine and thus hindering the PEC performance.49,50
Moreover, at λ > 420 nm, like the case of the photocurrent density measured under white-light, Au/H-TiO2-2 generates the highest photocurrent density (Fig. S4†), which is exactly twice higher than that of the pristine H-TiO2. Interestingly, under both simulated sunlight and visible-light illumination, the variation of the photocurrent density of all electrodes is almost the same (Fig. 8c), suggesting that Au NPs have similar quantitative effects on the improved PEC activities of H-TiO2.7
The photoconversion efficiencies (η) of H-TiO2 and Au/H-TiO2-2 can be obtained from the LSV curves using the following equation:51 η (%) = I(1.23 − Vapp)/Jlight(3)where I represents the measured photocurrent density (mA cm−2), Vapp is the applied bias potential vs. RHE, and Jlight is the incident light intensity (mW cm−2). Fig. 8d shows the plots of η as a function of Vapp. The pristine H-TiO2 achieves an optimal η of 0.275% at 0.842 V vs. RHE. Significantly, Au/H-TiO2-2 reaches the highest η of 0.687% at a relatively lower potential of 0.664 V vs. RHE. The lower current saturation potential may be due to the intrinsic high catalytic activity of Au NPs, reducing the activation energy (Ea) for water oxidation.52 Besides, the optimal η of Au/H-TiO2-2 gives three fold enhancement compared to that of the pristine H-TiO2. The higher η at the lower potential indicates the specificity of the present metal/semiconductor system, which can significantly reduce the current saturation potential and thus improve the photocatalytic activity for water splitting. These PEC results are very encouraging: a suitable loading amount of Au NPs can substantially enhance the η of H-TiO2 by improving the maximum photocurrents under both simulated sunlight and visible-light illumination, as well as reducing the current saturation potential.
The chopped LSV curves of H-TiO2 and Au/H-TiO2-2 were also investigated under simulated solar light irradiation (Fig. 8e). Clearly, only small photocurrents are observed in the dark. However, during “light on” cycles, both H-TiO2 and Au/H-TiO2-2 photoelectrodes demonstrate fast light responses, indicating efficient carrier separation in the present system. Fig. 8f shows the transient current density versus time of H-TiO2 and Au/H-TiO2-2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE. After long-term measurement (3100 s), the photocurrent density of H-TiO2 and Au/H-TiO2-2 still maintains 93% and 94.1% of the initial value, respectively. This result suggests that the incorporation of Au NPs on the H-TiO2 surface does not cause any photocorrosion.
EIS is usually used as an effective way to explore the charge transfer properties between electrodes and electrolytes. EIS measurements were performed at the open circuit potential (OCP) of the present system. Fig. 10a presents the EIS plots of H-TiO2 and Au/H-TiO2-2 photoanodes under light and dark conditions. Information about the charge transfer processes can be conveyed by the semicircles in the plots.4 The smaller the semicircle arc, the faster the interfacial charge transfer.53,54 Whether in the absence or presence of light, the arc radius of the EIS plots of Au/H-TiO2-2 is smaller than that of the bare H-TiO2. More interestingly, for these two samples, the arc radius in the dark is significantly greater than that under irradiation. According to previous works,55 without illumination, the charge transfer resistance tends to be infinite because of the small Faraday currents of electrodes, while under white-light illumination, the effective separation of photoinduced carriers leads to the great enlargement of Faraday currents, which diminishes the charge transfer resistance of the electrode/electrolyte interface. These EIS results confirm that Au/H-TiO2-2 exhibits smaller interfacial charge transfer resistance than the bare H-TiO2, which is beneficial for separating photoinduced carrier pairs and the mobility of electrons, in accordance with the LSV and I–t results.

Recently, OCPVD measurement has been widely used to evaluate the photoelectron lifetime and thus to assess the recombination rate of the photogenerated charge carriers.4,56,57 In the OCPVD measurement, the steady illumination is shut down and the subsequent time-dependent decay of photovoltage (Voc) is recorded (Fig. S5†). The OCPV after stopping the illumination exhibits a complex decay and can be estimated using the approximation derived by Bisquert.57 Accordingly, the photoelectron lifetime of the accumulated electrons is closely related to the drop in potential using the following equation: τ = −kBT/e × (dVoc/dt)−1(4)where τ is the photoelectron lifetime; kB = 1.381 × 10−23 J K−1; T is the temperature; e = −1.602 × 10−19 C. Clearly, a slower decay of Voc means a longer photoelectron lifetime. As shown in Fig. 10b, Au/H-TiO2-2 possesses a relatively longer electron lifetime than the bare H-TiO2. In addition, when stopping the illumination, for the pristine H-TiO2 electrode, the carrier lifetime is ∼0.3 s at the transient, while the Au/H-TiO2-2 photoanode shows a three times longer carrier lifetime of ∼1.0 s. This result indicates that there are more charge carrier active sites remaining on the Au/H-TiO2-2 surface than on the pristine H-TiO2, which significantly facilitates the transport of electrons and contributes to the improved PEC activities of the present system.4,56
The IPCE measurements were performed from 300 to 800 nm at 1.23 V vs. RHE to evaluate the correlation between the wavelength-dependent light absorption and the PEC performance of H-TiO2 and Au/H-TiO2-2 photoanodes. IPCE values can be obtained based on the following formula: IPCE = (1240I)/(λJlight)(5)where λ is the incident light wavelength (nm). As displayed in Fig. 10c, these two photoanodes show distinct photoactivity in the UV region, indicating the usage of UV light for efficient PEC water splitting. Additionally, Au/H-TiO2-2 shows enhanced PEC performance in the UV region compared to that in the absence of Au NPs, which matches well with the enhanced photocurrent density under white-light illumination. This result also indicates that the formed semiconductor–metal junction at the Au/H-TiO2 interface favors the separation of photogenerated carriers. Meanwhile, the photoactivity in the visible region is consistent with the obtained photocurrent results under visible-light illumination. It is noteworthy that the Au/H-TiO2-2 electrode has an IPCE peak at the wavelength of 550 nm (inset in Fig. 10c), corresponding to the SPR peak.

Fig. 10d presents a model of the PEC reaction mechanism of Au/H-TiO2 under white-light illumination. White light contains UV and visible light. Under white-light illumination, two patterns of electron transfer occur simultaneously. On the one side, H-TiO2 could be activated by the UV light, and the photogenerated electrons migrated to the CB of H-TiO2. On the other side, Au NPs essentially serve as photosensitizers, which have plasmonic absorption (visible part) and generate high energetic electrons upon SPR excitation, and these electrons migrate into the CB of the adjacent H-TiO2 over the semiconductor–metal junction.3 Then these electrons on the CB of H-TiO2 are driven by the applied potential to the photocathode, where they react with protons to form H2. The holes left in the valence band of H-TiO2 and the positive charges left on Au NPs can be used to oxidize water to form O2. When Au/H-TiO2 is under visible-light illumination only, the IPCE peak wavelength and the characteristic plasmonic wavelength of the Au NPs are highly consistent, indicating that the SPR effect of Au NPs mainly contributes to the enhanced visible-light activity.45 By contrast, Pt/H-TiO2 also exhibits about 1.5 times improvement in the photocurrent intensity under visible light compared to H-TiO2 (Fig. 9c). As depicted in a previous report,58 Pt NPs can capture visible light (Fig. 9d) and then transmit absorbed solar energy to adjacent H-TiO2, which is different from the process of SPR.
Conclusions
We have successfully fabricated a H-TiO2 photoanode by a one-step hydrothermal process. The H-TiO2 photoanode achieves an about 1.3 fold higher photocurrent density than its TiO2 NW-based counterpart at 1.23 V vs. RHE, and the precursor concentration plays a pivotal role in tuning the morphologies of the formed hierarchical TiO2 structures. Significantly, Au/H-TiO2-X photoanodes accomplished by a photochemical strategy yield significantly enhanced PEC performances. Among these Au/H-TiO2-X electrodes, the Au/H-TiO2-2 electrode achieves the highest photocurrent density of 1.99 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE under white-light illumination and a maximum η of 0.687% at 0.664 V vs. RHE. Meanwhile, both H-TiO2 and the Au/H-TiO2-X composite system have excellent photostability and fast light responses. In addition, the SPR effect of Au NPs contributes to the enhanced photoactivity of Au/H-TiO2-2 in the visible region. The present work signifies the rational design of the metal/semiconductor system as a new avenue for fabricating high-performance photoelectrodes for PEC water splitting.
