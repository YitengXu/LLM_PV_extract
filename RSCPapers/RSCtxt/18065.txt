As an effective means of protection, wearing masks has been widely adopted by the general public. The massive use of disposable masks has raised some emerging environmental and bio-safety concerns: improper handling of used masks may transfer the attached pathogens to environmental media; disposable masks mainly consist of polypropylene (PP) fibers which may aggravate the global plastic pollution; and the risks of long-term wearing of masks are elusive. To maximize the utilization and minimize the risks, efforts have been made to improve the performance of masks (e.g., antivirus properties and filtration efficiency), extend their functions (e.g., respiration monitoring and acting as a sampling device), develop new disinfection methods, and recycle masks. Despite that, from the perspective of the life cycle (from production, usage, and discard to disposal), comprehensive solutions are urgently needed to solve the environmental dilemma of disposable masks in both technologies (e.g., efficient use of raw materials, prolonging the service life, and enabling biodegradation) and policies (e.g., stricter industry criteria and garbage sorting).Qian LiuQian Liu is a Professor at Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences (RCEES, CAS).

Environmental significance
As it has become routine to wear masks daily for many people around the world, production and consumption of disposable masks have increased unprecedentedly. Massive use of disposable masks and mismanagement could raise related emerging environmental and bio-safety concerns, for example, disposable masks entering the aquatic environment could be a huge source of microplastics. This review presents and discusses potential environmental impacts of massive use of disposable masks as well as possible exposure risks of long-time wearing of disposable masks, then summarizes current progress in improving mask performance, reusing, recycling and biodegradation research, and finally gives solutions from a holistic perspective that may help alleviate the environmental and bio-safety concerns.

Introduction
Up to February 2nd, 2022, more than 200 countries had been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, and 380321615 confirmed cases including 5680741 deaths have been reported.1 Face masks, mainly used for protection in healthcare facilities, biochemical laboratories, and industrial activities in the past, are being widely used by the general public in daily life for protection during the COVID-19 pandemic. A number of studies have proved that wearing masks is an effective and cost-efficient approach to curb the spread of COVID-19.2–7 Thus, wearing masks has been recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) and soon adopted by almost all countries around the world.8 The protective effects of masks mainly come from their filtration which can block the exhalation of aerosols from infected people and simultaneously prevent healthy people from inhalation of harmful particles such as particles carrying the SARS-CoV-2 virus.9
During filtration of aerosols, gravity sedimentation and inertial impaction play major roles in filtering large aerosol particles (>1 μm); diffusion of Brownian motion and mechanical interaction are the main mechanisms for filtration of small particles (100 nm to 1 μm), and electrostatic attraction is important in filtering nano-scale particles (<100 nm).10 At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, different types of masks were used including medical masks, filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs), masks designed for protecting against PM2.5, and even homemade cloth masks due to the shortage of masks, as summarized in Table 1. The majority of homemade cloth masks did not work well in terms of filtration efficiency, especially for small particles (<300 nm; the average diameter of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is <100 nm).10,11 The middle filtration layer of medical masks and filtering facepiece respirators are electret filters which can be charged by corona discharge, electrospinning, triboelectric charging, etc.12 Due to the electrostatic interaction, medical masks and FFRs usually perform better than homemade cloth masks in blocking virus particles.13 Medical masks and FFRs without exhalation valves (N95, KN95 or FFP2 standards, or equivalents) are also recommended for personal protection, which are qualified by particulate filtration efficiency.14,15 For example, medical surgical masks in China can filter at least 30% of NaCl particles (0.3 μm aerodynamic mass median diameter) and 95% of staphylococcus aurei according to the standard YY 0469-2011, and N95 FFRs in the US can filter at least 90% of NaCl particles (0.3 μm aerodynamic mass median diameter) according to the NIOSH 42 CFR Part 84.

Generally, medical masks and FFRs are designed for single use. Surgical masks and N95 respirators are the most commonly used types among these disposable masks.16 Surgical masks are generally composed of nonwoven materials with a three-layer structure (i.e., spunbond-meltblown-spunbond (SMS); the fabrication process of meltblown fabrics is shown in Fig. 1A). The waterproof outer layer can block most liquid droplets, the inner layer can absorb exhaled droplets from the wearer, and the middle meltblown nonwoven layer can act as a filter to trap small particles from both sides (see Fig. 1B).17 N95 respirators also consist of nonwoven materials with multi-layer structures, such as SMMS and SMMMS. The common compositions of medical masks and respirators are presented in Table 1, and polypropylene (PP) is the most common raw material used to produce nonwovens and manufacture disposable masks, which mainly comes from petroleum and natural gas and has also been used to fabricate plastic bags, plastic bottles, agricultural films, etc.18 PP is one of the most widely used thermoplastics and also the most frequently discovered plastic in the environment.19

As the pandemic continues, the consumption of disposable masks is still increasing. Due to the plastic nature of disposable masks and insufficient management, impacts on the ecology and environment by the massive use of masks as well as potential health risks raised by wearing masks deserve intensive attention.20 Thus, the aim of this article is to analyze the demand and consumption of disposable masks during the pandemic and to discuss environmental and bio-safety concerns arising from the massive use of masks. Recent progress made to improve the performance of masks and the disinfection methods for reuse is also reviewed. In the end, we come up with solutions from the perspective of the life cycle (from production, usage, and discard to disposal) of disposable masks and prospects for future research and policies, aiming to alleviate the dilemma caused by their extensive use.
Current consumption of disposable masks
With the outbreak of COVID-19 and enhanced awareness of personal protection, demand and consumption of disposable masks has increased at an unprecedented rate. For example, the production rate of masks in China reached 116 million per day in early March of 2020, which was 12 times that of early February.21 In addition, a need of 89 million medical masks per month for global healthcare workers was estimated according to the WHO modelling result.22 Some studies have modeled and estimated the consumption of disposable masks in different regions and countries based on the local urban population and mask use rate.23–27 Estimated results include 3.4 billion masks being used daily globally23 and a monthly consumption of 129 billion disposable masks worldwide.24
Regarding the widespread use of masks by the general public, there are two ways to estimate the usage of masks: (i) the first method is based on the population and mask use ratio, and (ii) the second method is based on the production amount.28 To quantitatively estimate the growth of mask consumption as a result of the pandemic, here we have also used and compared both methods to estimate the growth of mask usage (the calculation details are provided in Tables S1 and S2†).
In the first method, the ratio of mask use and the frequency of replacing masks are key parameters. Fig. 2A shows the global mask use ratio (proportion of the population who always wear masks in public) which indicates a dramatic increase of the mask usage: it was relatively low at the beginning of the pandemic (about 15%) and quickly grew to about 60% in two months, and then the rate remained around 60% until the last two months when it slightly dropped to about 55%. Furthermore, we find that the frequency of replacing masks can also greatly influence the result. When the frequency is assumed to be 1 mask per capita per day (as used in ref. 23), the consumption of masks is estimated to be 1486 billion in 2020 and 1736 billion in 2021, which is comparable to other previous estimates such as an annual consumption of 1237 billion (ref. 23) and 1548 billion (ref. 24). When the frequency is assumed to be 1 mask per capita every 6 days (as used in ref. 28), the mask consumption is estimated to be 248 billion in 2020 and 289 billion in 2021. Such a large difference indicates that the first method needs to be further optimized, and some key parameters should be refined (e.g., by a questionnaire survey or actual monitoring).
 Fig. 2  Estimated trend of the mask use ratio (A) and mask consumption (B). The data in (A) are from IHME;175 the data in (B) are calculated based on China's mask production data from iiMedia Research,176 and calculation details are provided in Table S1.† 
In the second method, we estimate the annual production of masks in China before and after the outbreak of the pandemic and then extrapolate to global production.28 Assuming that all produced masks are in use, the production trend could also reflect the consumption trend. In this way, the trend of worldwide consumption of masks is shown in Fig. 2B. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, the annual mask consumption (2017–2019) was slowly rising. After the spread of the pandemic around the world, the consumption of masks increased dramatically and in 2020, reached 20.5 times of that in 2019. However, as the pandemic was gradually coming under control, the consumption of masks in 2021 decreased a bit (70% of that in 2020) but was still much higher than that before the pandemic (14.3 times that of 2019).
Assuming that a disposable mask contains ∼2.5 g of plastic on average29 and a maximum estimate of monthly consumption of 129 billion disposable masks worldwide, the annual global plastic waste from disposable masks is estimated to be 3.87 million tonnes, which is about half of the weight of our estimated global hospital waste related to the COVID-19 pandemic (7.02 million tonnes; the calculation details are provided in Table S3†). According to a report of PlasticsEurope, the global plastics production is 368 million tonnes in 2019.30 That is, the plastics used for mask manufacture could account for 1.05% of the gross production of plastics. A recent paper has predicted that COVID-19 would last with its adverse impact being mitigated and it may eventually become a recurrent disease.31 Based on this situation, we think that the consumption of masks will still remain at a high level in the next few years even though it is not likely to reach the record in 2020–2021.
Environmental and bio-safety concerns of disposable masks
The concerns about massive use of disposable masks include not only the pressure on the production amount and fossil fuel resource consumption, but also difficulties in subsequent disposal and environmental risks caused by improper management and handling. As a plastic product, disposable masks aggravate the concerns of global plastic pollution. The trapped bacteria and viruses and attached chemicals may be transferred to various environmental media along with disposable masks, posing potential risks to surrounding organisms. In addition, long-term wearing of disposable masks may increase the exposure risk to microplastics and other chemical additives, impacting the health of wearers.
Extra burden of plastic pollution
Disposable masks as a kind of plastic waste have exacerbated the current global plastics crisis. Many regions have reported that discarded masks without centralized processing can enter various environmental media through being disposed directly or being spread by wind, water flow, or other natural forces. Besides urban streets, coastlines, oceans and rivers,32–34 even glaciers from the Italian Central-Western Alps were found with a facemask, which was speculated to be brought and abandoned during mountaineering activity.35 The commonly used plastic components (PP and polyethylene (PE)) in disposable masks are difficult to degrade in the environment. The laboratory studies estimated that complete natural degradation of thermoplastic waste would cost 10–1000 years depending on the surroundings,36 and PP and PE waste debris could exist for over 10 years after landfill.37 Therefore, it is rational to predict that full degradation of disposable masks would be very difficult, just like other plastic waste.38 If disposable masks enter a place where the ecosystem is fragile such as glaciers along with human activities, the degradation may be very difficult, and the impact on the ecosystem may be exacerbated. In addition, unbroken masks in the natural environment can behave as a macro-scale contaminant, posing risks to aquatic animals when floating in the water. It has been reported that a Magellanic penguin stranded dead during the pandemic was found with a full protective mask in its stomach. This mask could not be digested or passed into the small intestine, which was thought to be responsible for the death.39 Moreover, the straps of masks probably entangle animals and encumber or suffocate them.40 Diverse animals (e.g., eagles, seagulls, monkeys, dogs, globefish, and crabs) around the world have been observed to interact with disposed masks.41
During the migration and accumulation in the environment, disposable masks can disintegrate into small pieces driven by physical, chemical, and biological forces (e.g., weathering, mechanical force, biological degradation, and ultraviolet (UV)-induced photo-oxidation).42 The fragmentation and release of microplastics will inevitably exacerbate the microplastic contamination.
Microplastics (MPs) are defined as plastics of size between 100 nm and 5 mm, and those with a particle size between 1 nm and 100 nm are named nanoplastics (NPs).43 Due to the small size, MPs and NPs are easily ingested by animals such as birds, fish, whales, turtles, zooplanktons, etc.,44 and could be accumulated in the digestive tract and possibly trigger inflammation.45 Chronic exposure to MPs and NPs can possibly reduce the feeding efficiency and energy uptake, lower mobility, and cause other individual behavioral changes.46,47 Besides, MPs and NPs can be internalized by aquatic and terrestrial plants as well.48,49 By impacting the lower but critical organisms, MPs and NPs can alter some basic biological-environmental processes, and then may affect the entire ecosystem through the trophic chain.50 Moreover, polymer debris could be colonized by microbes and transfer these microorganisms to new locations, raising risks of biological invasion.51
The diameter of PP fibers in the spunbond nonwoven fabrics is about 20 μm and that in the meltblown fabrics is approximately 1–5 μm (Fig. 1C).52 PP fibers in disposable masks are vulnerable to mechanical forces and easily released considering the low density of the polymer and characteristics of the non-woven fabric.32 Studies have confirmed the release of microplastic items from disposable masks under different simulated environmental conditions or processes, in which simulation of the aquatic environment was the most studied (see Table 2).

When simply simulating the aquatic environment by stirring new disposable masks in ultrapure water or artificial seawater, lots of microplastic fibers released were observed.53–59 Due to different brands of masks and varied simulation conditions, direct comparisons among these results are difficult, also implying that it is necessary to develop a standard process to evaluate the release of mask microplastics and their additives. Besides, the prolonged stirring duration, addition of detergents and alcohols, and being used could promote the release of microplastics (see Fig. 3A).55,56 Beatrice et al. reported that some reusable masks made of different materials (polyamide, polyester, polypropylene, polyurethane, and cotton fabrics) and surgical masks were also found to release fibrous microplastics during laundering in a washing machine.60 Despite this, it is not common for disposable masks to be washed in a washing machine, and microplastics from fabrics of clothes and sheets seem more dominant for laundering.

When a disposable mask was discarded and entered the natural environment, it was likely to undergo a long period of aging and weathering. Shen et al. found that two-month natural weathering could severely destroy the integrity of the mask and significantly increase the amount of released microplastics (2.5 × 104 times more than the pristine mask) as well as proportion of short-length (<0.5 mm) microplastic fibers (>80% for aged masks and <60% for pristine masks) when stirring in water.55 Wang et al. reported that long-term UV irradiation could supply energy to break C–C and C–H bonds in mask polymers, decrease the mechanical strength, and then exacerbate the release of microplastics; and the physical abrasion from sand in the aqueous environment could also significantly promote the release of microplastics.58 With more discarded masks entering the natural environment and experiencing weathering processes, disposable masks could be a nonnegligible potential source of microplastic fibers, and evaluation of ecological risks brought by these fibrous microplastics deserves more attention.61
MPs and NPs in the marine environment from various plastic products have been reported to be ingested by lots of marine organisms.44 It is also possible for marine organisms to take in MPs from disposable masks. A recent study exposing marine organisms to MPs from disposable masks for a short period of time (6 h) has found that all selected animals (rotifers, copepods, shrimps, scallops, and groupers) could ingest these MPs, and the MPs adsorbing onto the surface of diatoms might impede the photosynthesis (Fig. 4A).57 Except for the aquatic environment, lots of discarded masks have also got stuck in soils. MPs may also be released from these masks due to weathering and biological effects of soil microorganisms and animals, which could cause toxicity to soil organisms in turn. Kwak et al. observed meltblown fragments in the springtail body and excreta of earthworms after chronic exposure to disposable mask meltblown filter fragments (<300 μm) in soil, which proved the ingestion and egestion of meltblown fragments by soil invertebrates (Fig. 4B).52 The chronic exposure also significantly suppressed the reproduction and larval growth rate of springtails, as well as decreased intracellular esterase activity and damaged spermatogenesis of earthworms. Despite that the exposure concentration in this study seemed too high (1000 mg kg−1 dry soil) to reflect the real conditions, it hinted the risks of mask fibers for soil ecosystems. In addition, soil invertebrates could also accelerate the splitting of meltblown fragments to form nanofibers, since increased roughness, a deteriorated surface, and thinner fibers were found in meltblown fragments mixed with earthworms and springtails. To better understand ecological risks and biological impacts caused by MPs and NPs from disposable masks, more research is needed on evaluation of the quantity and related adverse biological effects of disposable masks entering the natural environment.

Vector to transmit chemicals and pathogens
Disposable masks entering the environment could attach chemicals and pathogens. Antioxidants, heat stabilizers, light and UV stabilizers, biocides and flame retardants are commonly added in plastics,62,63 some of which have endocrine disrupting effects.64 To fabricate disposable masks, hindered phenol, phosphite, sulphur antioxidants and hindered amine light stabilizers (HALS) are common additives in PP fibers,18 and occasionally dye molecules are also added. Sullivan et al. detected some other chemicals such as siliceous particles, inorganic metals (e.g., Pb, Cd, Sb, and Cu), plastic additives (e.g., polymer monomers and surfactants), polyethylene glycol, and dye-like molecules after simply stirring the disposable masks in ultrapure water.54 Liu et al. detected synthetic antioxidants (including 5 phenolic antioxidants and 4 organophosphate antioxidants) in all investigated 36 different brands of disposable masks, with a total concentration of synthetic antioxidants ranging from 20.0 to 575 μg g−1. According to the average concentration (175 μg g−1) of antioxidants and the assumed quantity of masks entering the environment, 108 tons per year of antioxidants from disposable masks were calculated to be released into the environment.65 A nontargeted analysis has identified several classes of chemicals contained in 19 types of mask materials, including organophosphorus, long chain amides, polyethylene terephthalate oligomers, n-alkanes, olefins, branched alkanes and long-chain organic acids, alcohols, and aldehydes.66 Fernandez-Arribas et al. reported that multiple organophosphate esters (OPEs, mainly used as a plasticizer and flame retardant) were detected in all investigated masks with the concentration ranging from 0.02 to 27.7 μg per mask, in which KN95 masks had the highest mean OPE concentration (11.6 μg per mask) and surgical masks had the lowest (0.24 μg per mask).16 Besides, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were also detected by directly putting mask pieces in headspace vials.67 Sixty commercially available surgical masks were examined with total VOC residues from 0.12 to 36.8 μg per mask with an average value of 5.4 μg per mask. These VOCs included reactive carbonyls (such as acrolein and glyoxal), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (mainly from 2 rings to 4 rings, such as naphthalene), and phthalate esters (such as diethyl phthalate and dibutyl phthalate).
In addition, MPs and NPs released from disposable masks have potential to adsorb and transport hydrophobic contaminants, depending on their environmental migration routes and chemical properties.68 These adsorbed contaminants may change microplastic characteristics of MPs and NPs from disposable masks and increase their ecological risks in the reservoir. PP microplastics from other plastic products were reported to be capable of adsorbing polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), flame retardants, polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), perfluoroalkyl sulfonates (PFASs), dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes (DDTs), estradiol, sulfamethazine, biocide triclosan, etc.,69 most of which show certain toxicities. However, few related studies about disposable masks have been reported.
In addition, used masks are a highly possible vector for transmitting pathogens, if discarded randomly. SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to remain viable on many surfaces for different periods of time. The duration times on the plastic surface, outer layer of masks, and inner layer of masks were measured to be 72 h, 168 h, and 96 h, respectively, which were longer than those on stainless steel, cardboard, glass, and metal surfaces.70 The RNA of SARS-CoV-2 has also been detected in sewage, wastewaters, and river waters, while the infectivity has not been determined yet.71 In addition to the feces and excreta from infected patients, the discarded used masks may also carry RNA to sewage and natural water bodies. It has been reported that disposable masks and other personal protective equipment (PPE) were found in the Mediterranean Sea, at the seaside of Hong Kong, and along the coastline of Agadir, Morocco, etc.33,34 Whether the coronaviruses can be transported into the ocean through the discarded masks and whether the viruses remain viably harmful to marine organisms still need further research. Besides marine organisms, many other terrestrial animals were also observed to contact discarded masks, which might be a way in which animals got infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus considering recently reported cases of infected gorillas, tigers, white-tailed deer, etc.72–74
Compared with the release of microplastic fibers, the environmental behaviors and ecological risks of these attached chemicals and pathogens have been less studied. Considering the high risks of some attachments, their release, migration, and transformation behaviors by masks need more investigation.
Potential impacts on human health
Despite the effect of disposable masks on preventing the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus,3 long-time wearing of masks could be a concern. It can be torturous to wear masks for some people, such as children whose cardiopulmonary functions are not fully developed and those who have respiratory diseases (e.g., asthma) or skin allergies. Respiratory resistance is a key parameter of masks. The upper limits of respirator resistance of medical surgical masks and filtering face respirators are 49 Pa and 350 Pa (inhalation)/250 Pa (exhalation), respectively, according to the China standard (Chinese Industry Standard YY 0469-2011), and excessive respiratory resistance may cause difficult breathing.75,76 A study showed an increasing risk of dyspnea associated with wearing N95 respirators for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients.77 In addition, some studies have shown that wearing a mask during exercising could impact cardiopulmonary capacity, such as an increasing heart rate, decreasing minute ventilation and oxygen uptake, etc., and surgical masks showed less adverse impact than N95 respirators, unless too strenuous exercise made surgical masks seriously wet and deformed.78–80 Moreover, it has been observed that the prolonged time of wearing masks could damage facial skin, causing some symptoms such as itching, redness, rash, peeling, etc., especially in frontline clinicians fighting against COVID-19.81–83 This may be ascribed to the muggy microenvironment created by wearing masks, or the materials and additives (such as VOCs67) of the inner nonwoven fabric or the straps which are anaphylactogens to some wearers. Studies also showed that wearing surgical masks or respirators might significantly increase skin hydration, cause transepidermal water loss, erythema, sebum secretion, or change the skin pH and temperature in the short term (4 h or 8 h).84–86 Hence, more skin-friendly masks are desired. It is also necessary for wearers to take both pathogen protection and personal comfort into consideration while choosing a suitable mask.
In addition, it is not only during environmental processes or in environmental media that masks may release MPs and other additives; MPs and additives can also be released and inhaled during wearing (Fig. 3B and 4C), which may increase the respiratory exposure risk. Some studies have conducted inhalation simulation to investigate the chemicals possibly being inhaled when wearing a mask. Li et al. tested several disposable masks and showed that filtered air through all the selected masks contained fewer fibrous microplastics than without a mask in a short time (2 h), while filtered air through all the masks except the N95 respirator promoted the release of fibrous microplastics compared with that without masks over a long time (720 h).87 Besides, the disinfection methods (ultraviolet irradiation, ethanol treatment, air blower treatment, washing with water, and exposure under sunlight) not only compromised the filtration performance of particles in air, but also exacerbated the release of fibrous microplastics from masks.87 Although the amount of fibrous microplastics released from masks is insignificant compared with inhaled airborne particles, the prolonged time of using masks (especially masks with poor quality and disinfected masks) could increase the risk of exposure to microplastics. Additionally, Ma et al. observed microplastic fibers from disposable masks in the nasal mucus of wearers, and indicated that a higher breathing frequency during wearing a mask would cause more microplastics to be inhaled and left in nasal mucus (rapid breathing > breathing and talking > breathing > breathing without wearing a mask).57 Actually, microplastics have also been detected in human organs, e.g., lungs, placentas, and feces, with inhalation as an important exposure route.88–90 In addition to ambient air, wearing a mask could also contribute to the inhalation exposure of released microplastic fibers. Compared with microplastic particles, microplastic fibers are more easily embedded in tissues and more difficult to remove, leading to a higher toxicity.54 Therefore, despite the small quantity of inhaled microplastic fibers reported in these studies, these findings still deserve to be concerned about.
Besides, wearing masks with high-level VOC residues could increase the VOC concentration of inhaled air in the breathing zone between the mask and wearer.67 Even the total VOCs and individual VOC levels were much lower than the limits (except acrolein); the risk of VOC exposure needs attention due to the harmful effects of long-term VOC exposure.91 It appeared that putting the mask in a well-ventilated place or heating up (∼50 °C) could help to remove VOC residues before wearing.67 More research about the impact of long-term wearing of masks on wearers is encouraged. The majority of current production standards of masks do not consider the release of microplastics and chemical residues, which is to be improved if more evidence of exposure risk is presented. In addition, impacts could also be studied combining psychology and social science. For example, a previous report pointed out that wearing masks under haze conditions could bring a false sense of security and thereby prolong the outdoor time, which could increase the exposure risk to haze in turn.92
Measures to maximize the utilization and minimize the risks of masks
Due to the indispensability of masks, intensive efforts have been made to improve the mask performance and promote their reuse, recycle, and green disposal. A lot of progress has been made to improve the antimicrobial or antivirus performance of masks, which could further reduce the risk of infection, especially for front-line healthcare workers. Meanwhile, more studies are needed on prolonging the service life, reusability, and making masks more eco-friendly. As early as during the outbreak of SARS in 2003 and the outbreak of H1N1 in 2011, various disinfection methods had been developed for reusing the disposable masks. At the beginning of the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, research on the disinfection and reuse of disposable masks has been greatly encouraged due to the serious mask shortage. Like many other wastes, discarded disposable masks would end up in landfills or incineration. However, in the long run, recycling materials and biodegradation of plastic waste are inevitable trends.
Improvement of mask performance
Although medical surgical masks and N95 respirators have been proved to work in reducing the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, these masks are not specially designed to prevent virus infection. Moreover, the single-use and short-service-life features of these masks have aggravated the consumption of masks and environmental pressure. Hence, many studies conducted after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic endeavored to improve the performance of masks, and some representative studies are summarized in Table 3.

Several functional materials were developed to enhance antimicrobial and antivirus properties of masks. For example, coating graphene onto medical surgical masks and N95 respirators could heat up and kill microbes under solar irradiation due to the photothermal properties of graphene.93–97 A nano-porous polyvinylidene fluoride membrane coated with carbon dots also showed antimicrobial properties based on photothermal theory.98 However, these antimicrobial properties based on photothermal theory require sunlight, which would be limited during cloudy days and nights. In addition, fabricating masks with new materials (such as polyamide (PA)-based N-halamine nanofibers, TiO2 nanowires, and MoS2 nanosheet-modified polycotton fabrics) or coating commercially-available masks with copper (such as copper nanoparticles, copper iodide particles, copper thin films, and copper@ZIF-8 core–shell nanowires) also showed improved antimicrobial performance.99–105 However, only a few studies have tested antiviral efficiency, which may be different from antibacterial efficiency. Some fabric materials capable of killing pathogens showed potential to be used in antimicrobial and antivirus masks, such as cotton fabrics treated with Viruferrin™ and cationic cotton fibers modified with anionic photosensitizers.106,107
Despite improved antimicrobial and antivirus performance, some other factors may compromise the practical use of new materials, such as the duration time, stability, impact on filtration and permeability of masks, cost, and new material-associated health risks (see Table 3). It is worth mentioning that Health Canada recently advised not to use unauthorized masks containing graphene, because graphene particles probably fell off and got inhaled, which might also pose health risks.108 Animal and cellular studies indicated that inhaled graphene nanoparticles could deposit on the respiratory tract, penetrate the bronchus, and increase the risk of granulomas and lung fibrosis.109 In fact, not only graphene, other added biocides or nanomaterials also have potential to fall off and be inhaled, or contact with facial skin and cause irritation and inflammation.110 Hence, further studies on safety assessment of these novel masks are needed.
Efforts have also been made to improve the filtration efficiency of masks by reducing the diameter of filter fibers, increasing the affinity between particles and filter fabrics, optimizing the fiber structure to form groove structures on the surface to trap more ultrafine particles, etc.111–114 The degree of fit between the mask and wearer also affects the filtration and protection performance of the mask since it was indicated that the gaps between the mask and wearer could lead to over 60% decline of filtration efficiency.10 Notably, 3D printing technology could act as a replenishment in the early shortage of masks and help to customize individual-fitting face seal masks and respirators. However, the protective effect against pathogens and comfort of wearing 3D-printed masks need to be tested.115–117 Considering the relatively long wearing time, especially for frontline clinicians, comfort is an important factor for masks. Block of heat dissipation is a major source of discomfort, and therefore, the thermal management of masks is of significance. A mask composed of nanofiber and nano-porous polyethylene has been reported to enable radiative cooling via high infrared transparency, and addition of a silver layer on polyethylene could help to keep warm in cold days via high reflectance of infrared radiation.118 Furthermore, some techniques have been developed to extend the service life of masks, such as repairing physically damaged respirators with solution-blown fibers and recharging the filter layer.119–121 Wang et al. reported that replacing the PP filter layer with polyvinyl alcohol fabrics charged by electrostatic spinning could retard the static electricity dissipation in a high-humidity environment as well as be recharged by hand slapping, which supported the prolonged wearing time.122
Several studies focused on extending the function of masks, such as respiration monitoring, SARS-CoV-2 virus reporting, and acting as a sampling device. The function of respiration monitoring could be achieved by integrating masks with a triboelectric nanogenerator, hybrid perfluorinated electret nanofibrous membrane, conductive metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), etc.111,123–125 In these cases, the visualization of electrical signals and the cost of application should be taken into consideration. Nguyen et al. enabled masks to report SARS-CoV-2 virus infection of wearers through a CRISPR-Cas12a nucleic acid sensor. This mask could collect respiratory droplets and aerosols of the wearer to detect the virus at a detection limit similar to that of current standard laboratory methods, and it could report the infection in ∼1.5 h without complex or professional operations.126 Furthermore, a face mask could be used as a sampling device free of additional input power to collect some substances in air as well as the aerosol exhaled from the wearer. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and nicotine and nitrosamines from tobacco smoke have been directly sampled using a mask to represent their concentration in the air environment.127,128 Yuan et al. inserted a solid phase microextraction (SPME) fiber into a KN95 mask to collect substances from exhaled breath aerosol and analyzed its chemical composition.129 Cai et al. fixed paper strips on the surfaces of inner and outer layers of a KN95 mask to separately monitor substances in the exhaled aerosol and inhaled air.130 From the perspective of convenience and safety, paper strips seem to be a better choice than the SPME fiber. These studies have shown the great potential of masks as a sampler in the research field of air pollutant exposure and human health, while quantification is problematic due to the heterogeneities in adsorption performance of masks and the breathing rate of wearers.
Developing biodegradable materials for fabrication of masks is also thought to be an important trend, which may help to mitigate the environmental persistence of plastics.131 The commonly-used PP in disposable masks is made of saturated carbon bonds, which is more difficult to degrade compared to other plastics of heteroatoms. Modifying the plastic raw materials, such as adding pro-oxygenic agents or introducing heteroatoms, could increase biodegradability. Replacing PP with other biodegradable plastics is also encouraged. Current commercial biodegradable plastics include polylactic acid (PLA), polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA), polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB), polyhydroxybutyrate valerate (PHBV), polyhydroxybutyrate (PHV), etc., most of which are made from bio-based materials, such as lignin, cellulose, starch, and bioethanol.131 Some cloth masks are actually made of biodegradable materials such as cotton, but their protection performance toward nano-particles and pathogens needs improvement. Deng et al. investigated cellulose nonwovens made from pulp and lyocell fibers to replace the outer PP layer of disposable masks.132 They modified the cellulose nonwovens with antiviral/antibacterial chemicals (guanidine-based polymer and neomycin sulfate) through covalent grafting, which showed great antiviral/antibacterial efficiency (including against SARS-CoV-2 virus), good mechanical strength, and adjustable hydrophobic properties, making the material a potential alternative of the outer PP layer. At the same time, its higher respiratory resistance and cytotoxicity than PP nonwoven temporarily limit its application and require further improvement.
Overall, although there is still a long way to go from laboratory research to large-scale production and application, the above-mentioned applications of novel materials and technologies provide much inspiration for mask improvement.
Disinfection and reuse
At present, commercially available masks are mostly designed to serve for only 4–8 h.29 Disinfection, as a straightforward approach, has gained much attention for reducing mask consumption. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (US CDC) has encouraged the reuse of filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) after decontamination.133
The reported disinfection methods include using ultraviolet germicidal radiation (UVGI), ethanol, vaporous hydrogen peroxide (VHP), hydrogen peroxide plasma, bleach, ozone, heating, steam, microwave-generated steam (MGS), microwave irradiation, etc.,13,134–142 as summarized in Table 4. However, many methods may destroy the structure of masks, causing the compromise of electrostatic charges, reduction of the filter efficiency and wearing fitness, increase of chemical residues, or promoting release of microplastics during use.55,143 Thus, the disinfection procedures should be carefully selected. Mask disinfection needs to meet three criteria: biocidal efficiency, maintenance of performance (e.g., integrity, filtration, and fitness), and safety for wearers.

Although both advantages and inadequacies exist for each disinfection method, VHP, UVGI and heating are the most investigated, and they have also been recommended by the US CDC.133 Combining different disinfection methods together may achieve better performance.137 Although some methods such as VHP and ozone showed a great disinfection effect, the requirement of specialized equipment makes them unsuitable for household use. Note that even if the masks get refreshed, they may only be acceptable for the same user. Overall, development of user-friendly, convenient, inexpensive, and flexible disinfection methods and procedures is highly valued.
Recycle and biodegradation
Generally, the collected used masks have two consequences: one is to be disposed of by incineration or a sanitary landfill,131 which currently is the main adopted approach; another is to be recycled. There are four recycling routes for plastic solid waste, namely re-extrusion (primary), mechanical (secondary), chemical (tertiary) and energy recovery (quaternary) treatment.144
The recycling and resource utilization of masks encounter many predicaments just like other plastic products. If using recycled masks as raw materials to manufacture masks or other products (primary or secondary treatment), the properties of these materials may be inferior to the virgin plastic materials,62 limiting their reprocessing. Actually, the recycle rate of PP-based plastic waste is less than 1% of the production amount now.145 Moreover, the cost and environmental burden are likely unexpected, which need a holistic evaluation.146 There were practices of mechanical recovery of disposable masks, such as adding shredded masks into recycled concrete aggregate for pavement base,147 using shredded masks as sound adsorbents,148 and injecting the mask melt into moulds to get products such as flower pots, storage bins, etc.149 Pyrolysis (tertiary treatment), a relatively promising technology for recycling of plastics,145 has been applied to masks and other PPEs for oligomer or monomer recovery and energy conversion.150–156 A study of pyrolysis of disposable masks found that masks mainly decomposed between 300 and 500 °C, yielding mixed gaseous products of H2, C1–2 hydrocarbons (CH4, C2H6 and C2H4) and other long-chain hydrocarbons. Compared with operation under a pure N2 atmosphere, addition of a Ni-based catalyst could significantly increase the transformation of long-chain hydrocarbons to short-chain hydrocarbons which were more valuable for subsequent industrial processing, and production of CO was finally observed under conditions of a CO2 atmosphere and Ni-based catalyst.152 This study has shown the potential of simultaneous mask recycle and CO2 utilization. Optimization of pyrolytic conditions and development of better catalysts are needed to acquire high-quality fuels and valuable chemicals. Exploration of co-pyrolysis techniques for mixed plastic wastes could ease the presorting and increase the applicability.145,151 Besides, the current incineration of mask waste could be combined with energy generation in the form of heating, steam, or electricity (quaternary treatment), since polypropylene and polyethylene are of a high calorific value.144
Biodegradation has provided great hope in eco-friendly disposal of plastic products. Following the aforementioned using biodegradable materials to make masks, microorganisms and enzymes play the key roles in the subsequent biodegradation process. Until now, establishment of microbe–enzyme systems is still challenging.157 On one hand, the low activity of many microbes and enzymes and their dependence on the optimized laboratory conditions may impede their application on a large scale or in natural environments. On the other hand, previous reports about these microbes and enzymes mainly focused on the attack of plastic polymers which contain hydrolysable bonds such as esters or amides.158 Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) appears to be the most studied,159 but research studies on PP and PE are scarce,160 probably due to their lack of hydrolysis sites. Overall, biodegradation is a promising route for mask disposal. The possible approaches include wide screening the potential strains from natural media, producing stronger engineered bacteria by genetic modification, improving the stability and productivity of enzymes, and adopting appropriate pretreatment methods (e.g., UV irradiation and adding oxidation agents) to introduce active groups onto the mask surface.158 Despite high cost, developing biodegradation systems could be applied not only to masks but also to other plastic waste. Complete biodegradation (fully convert carbon to carbon dioxide) combined with agriculture could promote the growth of plants and reduce greenhouse gas emission. Intermediates from incomplete biodegradation could be separated and recycled for chemical processing.161
Solutions to solve the environmental dilemma of disposable masks
It is a dilemma that disposable masks play an important role in curbing the pandemic while their massive use would inevitably increase the burden of energy consumption and environmental risks. To break through such a dilemma, we need comprehensive solutions covering the life cycle of masks—production, usage, discard, and disposal. Núria et al. conducted a life cycle assessment study to compare the environmental impacts of different masks (including 3D-printed masks with changeable filters, surgical masks, FFP2 masks with/without valves, and washable masks), but the assessment process needs to be refined.162 For example, it may be unrealistic to use a washable mask for 50 cycles considering the protective performance, and environmental impacts of using 3D printing equipment and special raw materials to manufacture 3D-printed masks were not taken into consideration. Despite this, life cycle assessment allows us to better understand the environmental impacts of masks. In this study, our focus is mainly on coming up with some solutions from a more holistic perspective which can synergistically improve the mask function and efficiency while reducing the environmental impacts (see Fig. 5).
 Fig. 5  Key steps and measures to alleviate environmental and bio-safety concerns from the life cycle of disposable masks. 
Production
Intensive studies are encouraged to design masks with higher security, filtration efficiency, antimicrobial activity, comfort, eco-friendly materials, reuse, and recycle potential. Moreover, advanced green technologies aiming at more efficient use of raw materials could not only bring economic benefits but also ease environmental pressure. Trying to use similar materials to fabricate different parts of a whole mask will help with subsequent sorting and recycling.162 Rational treatment of the possible contaminants (e.g., volatile organic solvents and antioxidants) during the production of masks should also be adopted.62
In addition to technical improvement, there is a need for stricter standards and criteria to guide the production of disposable masks. For example, with the spread of mask use, some manufacturers have added colorful patterns on masks, which may lead to inhalation of dyes and dyeing wastewater.54 Some additives (e.g., nanomaterials108) that have not been rigorously tested should be carefully applied in commercial disposable masks. More consideration about chemical residues and release of microplastics should be taken into production standards of masks. Furthermore, structural redesign of masks (such as shape162) could also be beneficial. For example, a mask design for an optimized filtering area could help to reduce the consumption of PP meltblown materials.
China is the largest supplier of masks in the world accounting for over 50% of the total production163 and there are more than 350 certificated mask manufacturers in China,164 so the management of mask production is critical for China. For example, the production of PP-based non-woven fabrics is the upstream of the mask industry chain, and novel materials (e.g., biodegradable and antibacterial materials) and technologies are under development, which needs relevant provisions to push forward the safety assessment of new materials/technologies (see Table 3).
Usage
In the 3R theory (reduce, reuse, and recycle), “reduce” is the highest priority to take effect.146 It is still an open question on whether it is appropriate to have all people wear masks everywhere. To minimize unnecessary economic and environmental burdens, it is necessary to reduce the use of masks in a scientific way. For example, in high-risk areas such as hospitals, quarantine areas, and testing areas, all people should wear masks and replace masks regularly. However, these measures could be mitigated for the general public in low-risk areas,14 and wearing masks is unnecessarily recommended in some rural areas where people are sparse.
In addition, as mentioned above, efficient and user-friendly disinfection procedures could also reduce the consumption of disposable masks. In the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, a document authorizing the use of decontaminated masks was issued by the US Food and Drug Administration but it was subsequently revoked because the supply of masks increased and the possible compromised performance of decontaminated masks.165 However, when masks become a daily product for most people, effective disinfection will greatly reduce their usage amount in the case of scientific guidance.
Since wearing masks is part of the comprehensive pandemic prevention, reducing mask use could be compensated by other measures, such as hand hygiene, increasing social distance (e.g., replacing mass gathering by online meeting), ventilation, and disinfection of confined spaces.166 In addition, vaccination is an important part in building public protective barriers. Although many countries have achieved over 50% vaccination coverage,1 the vaccination coverage in most African countries is still less than 20%, and more medical supports are needed in these countries.
Discard and disposal
Although masks used in hospitals, quarantine centers, and other healthcare institutions are centrally collected and subjected to specific disposal procedures,167,168 discarded masks by the general public may be mixed with other domestic wastes if clear instructions are not given. Garbage classification is an important aspect when discussing littering,144 which is crucial for subsequent disposal. Disposable masks discarded by the general public in low-risk areas may pose low infectivity and could be treated as general plastic waste.169 However, exclusive recycling bins for masks (like for batteries), if applicable, are recommended. It is necessary to arouse the awareness of disposable masks as plastic waste to foster public responsibility for proper handling of used masks. Research on intelligent identification, sorting, and collection should be encouraged.
Moreover, despite the low probability of getting infected through contacting masks from the general public,166 it is still risky to handle the discarded masks without personal protection. Appropriate protection and operation training for garbage collectors and relative operators are important. Singh et al. reported the status of relevant workers' training in dealing with medical waste.170 The data showed that an average of 41% of workers have been trained in the investigated countries, while India and Egypt had a lower training rate of about 20%.
Although recycling and resource utilization are better options from the perspective of sustainability, the current main disposal methods of masks, i.e., incineration and sanitary landfill, will not be replaced shortly and still need technical improvement.171 Disposable masks generated from hospitals and other healthcare facilities belong to medical waste. Most issued policies and guidance for COVID-19 medical waste management recommend incineration as the final treatment, and landfill is also recommended in some developing countries.169 The disposable masks used by the general public mixed with other domestic waste may be treated as municipal solid waste (MSW). Some countries in Northern Europe (e.g., Norway, Finland, Denmark, and Sweden) treated over 50% of MSW by incineration; ∼74% of MSW was incinerated and ∼3% was landfilled in Japan; more than 50% of MSW was landfilled in the US; developing countries such as China, India, and Indonesia treated more MSW through landfill compared to incineration.171 Both incineration and landfill need to be regulated to avoid causing adverse environmental impacts. During incineration, high carbon emissions and toxic gases need to be handled properly, such as organophosphite antioxidants detected in disposable masks can potentially be released during burning,65 and dioxin and furans can also potentially be released.172 Utilizing the energy from mask incineration is also valuable. Landfill could bring a series of problems,173 such as land use, leaching of toxic chemicals (heavy metal, plasticizers, dye molecules, etc.), formation of microplastics, contamination of underground water, and emission of ethane, carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, all of which need precaution.173 In addition, open dumps may lead to worse ecological effects and even accelerate the spread of pathogens.173 Therefore, it is of profound significance to optimize the flexibility and efficiency of existing waste management and disposal systems to avoid situations like open dumps.
Conclusions and prospects
The COVID-19 pandemic has greatly changed our lifestyle and social habits all around the world. Considering a similar crisis possibly erupting again in the future, it is of great significance to learn lessons from this pandemic. Wearing a mask has been considered as an important preventive measure; however, the improvement of masks as a commercial product and the disposal of masks as plastic solid waste still require profound rethinking. It is noteworthy that the regional mask policies may change with the pandemic situation changing. For example, regional control of the pandemic may lead to a relaxation of the requirement to wear masks in public, accompanied by a decrease in the consumption of masks. Since COVID-19 has been predicted to last with mitigated adverse impact and finally become a recurrent disease, wearing masks will play an important long-term role in public health, and the consumption of masks will maintain at a high level over the next few years. Therefore, the current proven policies on masks are recommended to be maintained, especially for the discard and disposal policies. We herein come up with some suggestions which may help to make up for the deficiencies emerging with the massive use of disposable masks.
(1) As a personal protective device, masks were most used in certain occupational settings in the past; however, the pandemic has increased the acceptance of masks of the general public around the world. In fact, people in regions with serious air pollution (e.g., North China) may have got used to wearing masks, which have been widely used to prevent haze hazards. Likewise, there are many expectations for the advance of antivirus and antibacterial functions of masks. In this aspect, research is still in demand to assess the stability, safety, and feasibility of scale-up production. It is also necessary to establish standardized evaluation systems for antibacterial and antiviral performance to allow direct comparison. A longer service life and self-cleaning properties are also worthwhile. In addition, development of more functions such as respiratory or healthy monitoring, detection of virus, acting as a sampling device, risk warning (e.g., toward pathogens, toxic chemicals, and fine particles), and active protection will make masks join the trend of intelligent wear. Additionally, visualization and networking of the signal output are also important.
(2) The environmental and ecological risks caused by a large number of discarded masks are to be fully recognized. Since it is a fact that a huge number of disposable masks have entered the natural environment, more data and evidence about their environmental behaviors and fate are desired to clarify their impacts on whole ecosystems. The current estimate models of mask consumption need to be further improved to be more accurate and precise. For instance, a more actual mask acceptance rate in different regions can be obtained through a questionnaire survey covering a larger population. More sophisticated models for assessing mask consumption and related policymaking are required.
(3) Recycling and biodegradation are problems of all plastic waste including masks. In the short run, more studies are required to extend existing recycling and biodegradation technologies to the disposal of masks. In the long term, design of more environmentally-friendly products, establishment of more sound waste collection and sorting systems, and implementation of more efficient and greener waste utilization and disposal technologies are indispensable.
(4) Finally, it should not be neglected that disposable masks are a kind of medical waste. There are standard procedures for the management of medical waste in many countries; however, insufficient capacity to dispose of medical wastes has arisen during this pandemic. Hence, it is crucial to continuously increase the flexibility and capacity of medical waste disposal systems.

Environmental significance
As it has become routine to wear masks daily for many people around the world, production and consumption of disposable masks have increased unprecedentedly. Massive use of disposable masks and mismanagement could raise related emerging environmental and bio-safety concerns, for example, disposable masks entering the aquatic environment could be a huge source of microplastics. This review presents and discusses potential environmental impacts of massive use of disposable masks as well as possible exposure risks of long-time wearing of disposable masks, then summarizes current progress in improving mask performance, reusing, recycling and biodegradation research, and finally gives solutions from a holistic perspective that may help alleviate the environmental and bio-safety concerns.

Surgical masks	• UV irradiation • Stirred in artificial seawater solution	• UV irradiation damaged mechanical properties of fibers and promoted release of microplastics	
53

Several disposable masks (including surgical masks, dyed masks, and children’s masks)	• Stirred in ultrapure water	• Micro- and nano-plastic fibers and inorganic particles containing Si and Pb were released • Heavy metal (such as Cd, Co, Cu, Pb, Sb, and Ti) and organic species (such as polyamide, polyethylene glycol-like derivatives, and dye-like molecules) were detected in leachates	
54

Surgical masks	• Intact/horizontal cutting/vertical cutting/two-month naturally weathering mask • Stirred in water/detergent solution/alcohol disinfection solution	• Increased washing time increased release of microplastics • The detergent and alcohol exacerbated release of microplastics • Fragmentation and natural weathering significantly promoted release of microplastics • Released microplastic fibers of length <0.5 mm were in the majority	
55

Used/unused masks: surgical masks, disposal medical masks, normal disposal masks and N95 masks	• Used masks: worn for 24 h • Stirred in deionized water	• Microplastics released from used masks were 6.0–8.1 times more than those from unused masks • Microplastic fibers accounted for >70% of total released microplastics • Proportion of released colored microplastics increased	
56

Surgical masks; N95 respirators	• Shaken in ultrapure water • Collecting nasal mucus of mask wearers	• Most released particles were nano scale (<100 nm) • 1.6–3.8 × 109 nano-plastics were released from a single mask • The filter layer released more and smaller particles than the inner and outer layers • 2.6 ± 0.4 to 10.6 ± 2.3 microplastics per mg nasal mucus were found • Higher breathing frequency increased the amount of inhaled microplastics	
57

Masks made of polyamide, polyester, polypropylene, polyurethane and cotton fabrics; surgical masks	• Laundered in a washing machine without detergents	• All investigated masks released microplastics • The mask made of polyurethane released the most among synthetic fabrics • 85.33 ± 6.93 microplastic fibers was released from a surgical mask, and the length was <1 mm

87

Three-layer disposable mask	• UV irradiation • Shaken in deionized water with/without sand	• Long-time UV weathering decreased mechanical strength of mask fabrics and increased release of microplastics (especially through the filter layer) • Presence of sand in water increased the release of microplastics	
58

Surgical mask (intermediate layer)	• Stirred in ultrapure water	• Increased mechanical stress forces caused higher weight loss and more release of microplastics • Particles of size <0.5 μm were predominant in the number of released microplastics

66

Surgical masks; self-filtering masks; KN95 respirators; FFP2 masks; FFP3 masks; re-useable masks	• Total content: hexane:acetone (1:1); ultrasonic; • Inhaling simulation: a flow rate of 10 L min−1, 6 h, and quartz microfiber filters for absorption	• Organophosphate esters (OPEs) were detected in all masks • KN95 masks had the highest mean OPE concentration (11.6 μg per mask) and surgical masks had the lowest (0.24 μg per mask) • OPE exposure caused by wearing masks was below safety limits

65

Surgical masks	• Sealed in a headspace vial • Soaked with acetonitrile; sonication • Inhaling simulation: collecting air behind mask with sorbent tube or cartridge	• All investigated masks were detected with volatile organic compounds (VOCs) ranging from 0.12 to 36.8 μg per mask, including alkanes, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, phthalate esters, and reactive carbonyls; • Wearing the mask with higher residue VOCs increased inhalation exposure of VOCs • For the acrolein concentration in the behind-mask breathing zone: all investigated masks exceeded the inhalation reference limit set by EPA, and the mask with the highest residue acrolein content also exceeded the limit set by Health Canada • Heating the mask at 50 °C for 1 h could reduce 80% of residue VOCs
