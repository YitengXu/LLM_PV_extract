    , Accepted 28th September 2015First published on 30th September 2015AbstractThree (D–A–D)-type electron donor materials, containing 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole as the electron-withdrawing core, and benzothiophene, naphthalene, and thiophene as electron-donating terminal groups, were synthesized for vacuum-depositable small-molecule organic solar cells. The donor material containing thiophene as the terminal group, DT, shows a maximum power conversion efficiency of 4.13%, a short-circuit current density of 9.89 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage of 0.86 V, and a fill factor of 0.48, in a bulk heterojunction solar cell with a blend ratio of DT:C70 = 1:4 under simulated AM 1.5 solar irradiation at 100 mW cm−2.
Introduction
Organic photovoltaics (OPVs) convert solar energy to electrical energy and thus have attracted considerable interest as a possible alternative to conventional inorganic photovoltaics. OPV devices have several advantages over inorganic solar cells, such as mechanical flexibility, easy synthesis of active-layer materials, light weight, and low manufacturing cost. Owing to these advantages, intensive research towards the development of OPV devices has been conducted,1 in spite of their lower power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) compared to inorganic solar cells.
The PCE of p–n junction OPVs can be increased by facilitating exciton diffusion and exciton dissociation, using a bulk heterojunction (BHJ) structure and fullerene derivatives, respectively.2 Current studies on OPVs are usually focused on enhancing their PCEs using novel electron donor materials. A general method for enhancing the PCE of OPVs using organic electron donors is by improving the light harvesting ability, which can be generally achieved by broadening the absorption ranges or by increasing the molar extinction coefficients. Usually, broadening absorption ranges is easier and more efficient than increasing molar extinction coefficients.
In this study, we have designed and synthesized three donor–acceptor–donor (D–A–D)-type organic electron donor molecules (NP, BT, and DT) to broaden the light absorption ranges, consisting of 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole as the electron-withdrawing core,3,4 and benzothiophene, naphthalene, and thiophene as the electron-donating terminal groups. Two thiophene units were used as spacers between the electron-withdrawing core and the electron-donating terminal groups, because of the good hole/electron transporting ability of oligothiophenes.5–7 It is well known that intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) in a D–A-type molecule lowers the HOMO/LUMO energy level gap and thus induces broad strong absorption with a bathochromic shift in addition to its own π–π* absorption band.8 The three donor molecules have relatively broad absorption ranges due to ICT and have good intermolecular interaction due to their relatively flat structures. BHJ OPV devices fabricated using a blend ratio of DT:C70 = 1:4 exhibited a maximum PCE of 4.13%.
Experimental
Instruments

1H NMR spectra were recorded in CDCl3 or DMSO using an Avance 300 MHz or 500 MHz Bruker spectrometer. Mass spectra were obtained using a Bruker MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer. Elemental analysis was performed using a Carlo-Erba model EA 1112 elemental analyser. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed using a TA instrument model Q-5000 IR. UV-vis spectra were recorded on a Beckman DU 650 spectrophotometer. Fluorescence spectra were recorded on a Jasco FP-7500 spectrophotometer. For solid-state measurements, the materials were thermally vapour-deposited on quartz plates in a vacuum chamber to form 40 nm-thick films. The cyclic voltammetric (CV) apparatus used was a CH Instruments model 650B electrochemical workstation. Cyclic voltammograms were obtained at room temperature in a three-electrode cell using a glassy carbon working electrode, a Ag/Ag+ (0.01 M) reference electrode, and a Pt counter electrode, in dichloromethane or dimethylformamide containing tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (0.1 M) as a supporting electrolyte, at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. All potentials were calibrated using the standard ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) redox couple. X-ray diffraction spectra were obtained using a D8 ADVANCE from DAVINCI, BRUKER. Molecular structures at the ground state and the HOMO/LUMO energy levels were calculated using Gaussian 09 Rev. B01 by the DFT/B3LYP method with the 6-31G basis set.

Device fabrication
We fabricated planar heterojunction (PHJ) and bulk heterojunction (BHJ) devices (4 mm2) with configurations of ITO (150 nm)/MoO3 (5 nm)/donor (10 nm)/C70 (40 nm)/2,9-dimethyl-4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenathroline (BCP) (8 nm)/Al (100 nm) and ITO (150 nm)/MoO3 (5 nm)/donor:C70 (1:1, 1:4; 50 nm)/C70 (40 nm)/BCP (8 nm)/Al (100 nm), respectively. In these devices, MoO3 was used as the hole-injection layer, a fullerene derivative was used as the acceptor, and BCP was used as the exciton blocking layer. All layers were prepared by vacuum deposition.
Calculations
To investigate the correlation between the molecular structure and the photophysical properties, we performed molecular orbital calculations using density functional theory (DFT). The ground state geometries and the molecular orbital distributions of these molecules were optimized under vacuum using the DFT/B3LYP method with the 6-311G(d,p) basis set in the Gaussian 09' B.01 package. Fig. 1 shows electron density distributions of the HOMOs and LUMOs of the three donor molecules. All of them have broad electron density distributions at the HOMO levels, and a localized electron distribution in the benzothiadiazole core region at the LUMO levels. Calculations predicted that these donor molecules will show absorption bands resulting from ICT. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of donor molecules are stated in Table 1; the LUMO energy levels are high enough to transfer electrons to the acceptor molecule, C70.11

Results and discussion
Photophysical and physical properties
New D–A–D type electron donor materials (BT, NP and DT) were synthesized by the palladium catalysed Suzuki coupling reaction between compound 1 (for NP and BT) or 4,7-dibromo-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (for DT) and aryl boronate according to Scheme 1. Fig. 2 shows the ultraviolet-visible absorption (UV-vis) and photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the three donor materials in solution and in solid films. The three donor materials show their first absorption maxima at 356 nm (DT, NP) and at 362 nm (BT) due to the π–π* transition of terminal groups and their second absorption maxima at 502 nm (DT, BT) and 499 nm (NP) due to ICT. Between the solution-state and solid-film-state spectra of the three donor molecules, there are no significant changes in the first and second absorption bands, but band broadening is observed, which can be measured by the full-width at half-maximum (FWHM). NP shows a maximum at 518 nm with a FWHM of 142 nm (104 nm in solution), DT shows a maximum at 527 nm with a FWHM of 148 nm (101 nm in solution) and BT shows a maximum at 475 nm with a FWHM of 170 nm (106 nm in solution). The three donor materials show a high thermal stability of Td over 350 °C, as revealed by the TGA thermograms (Fig. S7–S9, ESI†), although DT is least stable among the three materials presumably due to the absence of alkyl termination moieties in the thiophene end-groups. The cyclic voltammograms of three donor materials show the irreversible redox process in dichloromethane or dimethylformamide (Fig. S10, ESI†).

Photovoltaic cell properties
We fabricated the PHJ and BHJ devices as described in the experimental section. For the PHJ devices, the thickness of the donor layers varies from 10 to 30 nm. Fig. 3 shows the current density vs. voltage (J–V) characteristics of the PHJ and BHJ devices fabricated using each donor material. The NP- and BT-based PHJ devices show better performance with a 10 nm-thick donor layer rather than with a thicker donor layer (Fig. S1–S3 and Tables S1–S3, ESI†). This is presumably because their HOMO energy level is too low relative to the transparent conducting oxide (TCO). This is also reflected in the S-shaped curves at the intercept on the voltage axis of the J–V plots as shown in Fig. S2 and S3 (ESI†). Electrochemical experimental data also support that NP has a deep-lying HOMO relative to the TCO (valence energy level −4.8 eV) (Table 1).11 Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of DT, NP, and BT films clearly indicate the greater tendency of DT to form larger aggregates (Fig. S4, ESI†) compared to NP and BT, which presumably results in less efficient exciton dissociation at the interface for DT-based PHJ devices and thus lowers the fill factor (0.30) and decreases the PCE (1.32%) in spite of the higher current density (Jsc) (6.58 mA cm−2) (Table 2).

In general, PHJ devices show lower Jsc values compared to BHJ devices, because they have narrower exciton dissociation areas than BHJ ones.12 Therefore, we fabricated devices co-deposited with C70 to improve Jsc by increasing the interfacial area between the electron donor and the electron acceptor. As expected, the co-deposited devices show higher Jsc values for all devices at a blend ratio BT or NP or DT:C70 = 1:4, compared to those of the PHJ devices. This tendency is also observed in the incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) plots (Fig. S5, ESI†). The degree of PCE enhancement of NP- and BT-based BHJ devices compared to the PHJ devices is always less than the increase in current density, because BHJ devices exhibit lower fill factor values. The lower fill factor values of the NP- and BT-based BHJ devices result from the increased series resistances of BHJ devices compared to those of PHJ devices (Tables S2 and S3, ESI†). For example, the series resistance of the BT-based BHJ devices (BT:C70 = 1:4, 50 nm, 13.36 Ω cm−2) is larger than that of the BT-based PHJ devices (BT 10 nm/C70 35 nm, 2.30 Ω cm−2) (Table S2, ESI†). This tendency is also observed in the case of the NP-based devices (Table S3, ESI†). The larger series resistances of the BT- and NP-based BHJ devices are due to the mixed layer. The co-deposited layers generate more interfaces compared to the PHJ layers, which increases not only the photo-current density,13 but also the electrical resistance owing to discrete domains, increased contact resistance, and longer electrical pathways.14 The fact that DT-based BHJ devices display better PCE values than the NP-based BHJ devices can be rationalized by the AFM images of DT:C70- and NP:C70-blended films, which clearly show different domain sizes (Fig. 4). The DT:C70-blended film with a larger domain compared to the NP:C70-blended film generates a smaller interfacial area, which results in lower electrical resistance. Another reason for the lower electrical resistance of the DT-based BHJ devices was revealed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectroscopy. The XRD spectrum of the DT:C70-blended film shows a well-preserved C70 aggregation peak (2θ = 21°)15,16 compared to the NP:C70-blended film (Fig. S6, ESI†). This implies that C70 preserves good crystalline morphology even in the DT:C70-blended film, thereby facilitating electron extraction.17

Conclusions
Three D–A–D-type electron donor materials (NP, DT, and BT), consisting of 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole as the electron withdrawing core, and benzothiophene, naphthalene, and thiophene as the electron donating terminal groups, were designed and synthesised for vacuum-depositable small-molecule organic solar cells. The maximum open-circuit voltage, short-circuit current density, and power conversion efficiency values of the bulk heterojunction device based on DT:C70 = 1:4 were 0.86 V, 9.89 mA cm−2, and 4.13%, respectively, under simulated AM 1.5 solar irradiation at 100 mW cm−2.
