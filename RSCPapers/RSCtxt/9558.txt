    , Accepted 2nd December 2021First published on 3rd December 2021AbstractMetal ion capacitors (MICs), as the combination of supercapacitors and rechargeable batteries, are endowed with higher energy density and longer cycle life but not at the expense of high-power properties. The low reserves and uneven geographical distribution of lithium resources stimulate enormous interest in alternative non-lithium based MICs (NLMICs). In recent years, tremendous efforts have been devoted to design and fabricate high performance NLMIC systems. Although still facing many challenges, the development of NLMICs has been made great progress. In this review, we first discuss the operating mechanisms of the NLMIC systems, and then mainly review the research progresses of the involved electrode materials, aqueous/organic electrolytes, and device design toward monovalent (Na+ and K+) and multivalent (Mg2+, Ca2+, Zn2+, and Al3+) MICs.

1. Introduction
The emerging energy (fossil reserves) crisis stimulates researchers to develop new energy storage devices such as supercapacitors, rechargeable batteries, and metal ion capacitors (MICs).1,2 Supercapacitors can be classified into two types based on the charge storage mechanism.3,4 Materials where the charges stored through ion adsorption/desorption on the surface of the active materials are called electrochemical double layer capacitors (EDLCs), whereas when the charges are stored through faradaic oxidation/reduction, they are called pseudocapacitors.5,6 In EDLC-based capacitors, carbon-based materials such as activated carbon (AC), carbon nanotubes (CNTs),7,8 graphene,9,10 and carbon aerogels11,12 have been extensively studied as electrode materials. For pseudocapacitors, transition metal oxides (RuOx,13 MnO2,14 V2O5 (ref. 15)), transition metal sulfides (NiS16 and FeS2 (ref. 17)), and conducting polymers18,19 have been widely investigated as electrode materials. These supercapacitors generally yield high power density and better cycling stability than secondary batteries but unsatisfactory energy density. On the other hand, in metal ion batteries (MIBs), the insertion of metal ions that enables redox reaction in bulk active materials usually delivers high energy density.20,21 Commercial lithium ion batteries yield a specific energy density up to 200 W h kg−1.22,23 However, their power density and cycling performance are often unsatisfactory, which limit their application in areas where high power density is required. This has stimulated researchers to find advanced energy storage devices that can provide both high energy and power density. Hence, MICs that bridge the gap between conventional EDLCs and MIBs emerged at a historic moment.24–27 The Ragone plot (Fig. 1) explains the relationship between the energy and power density of electrochemical energy storage devices.

MICs endowed with both high energy density and high-power properties have obtained wide attention. MICs typically consist of a battery type electrode for a high charge storage capacity as well as a supercapacitor type electrode for rapid charging.28–31 G. G. Amatucci et al. first reported the design of hybrid nonaqueous Li-ion capacitor (LiIC) using Li4Ti5O12 as the anode and AC as the cathode.32 After that, various MICs systems including monovalent ions (Na+, K+), bivalent ions (Mg2+, Ca2+ and Zn2+), and trivalent ions (Al3+)-based MICs have been developed. The timeline of the MIC systems is shown in Fig. 2a.32–38 The historical evaluation of the scientific publications on LiICs is shown in Fig. 2b, where the data from January 2001 to August 2021 was acquired from Web of Science. Over the past two decades, researchers have devoted their efforts to optimizing the existing or developing new LiIC systems to enhance the energy as well as power density. Nevertheless, the increasing utilization of lithium and aggravated deficiency of lithium resources have stimulated researchers to find alternative energy storage systems for LiICs. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the crustal storage of metals as well as the theoretical capacity of alternative non-lithium-based MICs (NLMICs). Fig. 2c depicts the contribution of scientific articles published from 2012 to August 2021 for NLMICs, which indicates that most research works have been done for Na-ion capacitors (NaICs) (∼64.41%) and the least works have been published for Ca-ion capacitors (CaICs).

Lithium, sodium, and potassium belong to the same period of alkali metals. Monovalent elements (Na and K) have similar physical and chemical properties as Li, and their natural abundance makes them suitable for developing new MICs systems. However, the ionic radius of Na+ (r = 1.02 Å) and K+ (r = 1.38 Å) is larger than that of Li+ (r = 0.76 Å), which reduces the electrochemical kinetics at the electrode/electrolyte interface, resulting in unsatisfactory rate performance and cycling life. Therefore, recent studies have mostly focused on developing new structures that would allow Na+ and K+ to be inserted and extruded quickly enough. Magnesium and calcium belong to the alkaline earth group in the periodic table. These elements have greater natural abundance than lithium resources on earth. Due to their less polarizing character, Mg2+ and Ca2+ ions have higher ionic mobility at the electrode/electrolyte interface. It is also noted that the ionic radius of Mg2+ is similar to that of Li+, and that of Ca2+ is similar to Na+.39 This represents that MIC systems based on these divalent cations would have good electrochemical properties. Zn-ion capacitors (ZnICs) have several advantages such as low costs, low flammability, environmental friendliness, and good electrochemical energy storage properties. In particular, the use of aqueous electrolytes that simplifies the assembly process endows ZnICs with great potential in the field of advanced electrochemical energy storage.40 Aluminum can provide three-electron transfer during the charge/discharge process, which will deliver high volumetric capacity, thus resulting in potentially higher energy. Al3+ ion-based energy storage devices have been considered as a promising alternative to most commonly used Li+ ion-based systems. However, aluminum has the tendency to corrode during the electrochemical reaction, which shortens the cycle life of the Al-ion capacitors (AlICs).41 The great breakthrough in AlICs still faces several challenges. The detailed physical and chemical properties of non-lithium metals are summarized in Table 1.

Reviews in the area of MICs have been reported, for example, the critical review of hybrid ion capacitors by J. Ding et al.40 They have discussed the evolution of MICs from the aqueous electrolyte to the high voltage carbonate-based battery electrolyte and have given a detailed report of the materials, which were used in MICs. Specifically, they have focused on Li+ and Na+ ion-based systems. X. Yu and co-workers have reviewed the recent progress and challenges in multivalent MICs,42 mainly including electrode materials, electrolytes, and the design concept of the devices. A recent review by L. Dong et al. reported the research progress of multivalent metal ion-based capacitors, in which Zn2+ ions-based works were emphatically introduced.41 They have discussed in detail the charge storage mechanism, design concept, and the electrochemical behavior. These reviews helped us to develop a quick and better understanding of MICs and played an important guiding role in the development of advanced energy storage systems. Still, a comprehensive summary and discussion of NLMICs is necessary and lacking. Herein, we provide an overall review on the research progress of non-lithium monovalent (Na+, K+) and multivalent (Mg2+, Ca2+, Zn2+, and Al3+) cation-based capacitors, including the charge storage mechanisms, electrode materials, electrolytes, device fabrication, as well as the future perspective and challenges of NLMICs (Fig. 3).

2. Construction and operating mechanisms of MICs

Fig. 4 presents the common cell structure of the MICs. The MICs are commonly constructed using faradaic electrode materials (battery type) as the anode, EDLC electrode materials as the cathode, separator, and electrolyte. The general anode materials, cathode materials, and electrolytes have been summarized, as well as the design directions of these materials (Fig. 4). To date, carbonaceous materials, metal oxides, metal dichalcogenides, MXenes, and metal alloys have been widely used as anode materials.42–45 According to the charge storage mechanisms, the anode materials can be categorized into intercalation type, conversion type, and alloying type. For the intercalation/deintercalation mechanism, the solvated ions first diffuse into the electrode/electrolyte interface, and are then desolvated at the interface before the ions are intercalated into the host materials. Therefore, in view of the large ionic radii of K+, the electrode materials in Li+ and Na+ systems may not be structurally stable in the K+ ion system.39 The choice of suitable host materials with large channels and robust structure for K+ ions is crucial. Carbonaceous materials with large tunnels, allowing fast intercalation/deintercalation of cations, are typical intercalation anode materials. Carbons derived from biomass, macromolecular polymers, etc., have been developed as anode materials for MICs. Rational structural design and heteroatom doping are efficient improvement strategies to improve the performance of carbon materials.46 In addition, MXene, niobium-based, and titanium-based compounds are also the star materials in the investigation of anode materials because of their suitable and/or adjustable interlayer structure.47 In multivalent ion systems, the higher charge densities of the ions may cause strong ion–electrolyte interaction, and higher desolvation energy.42 Hence, suitable electrolyte systems are of great importance for multivalent ion capacitors. For the conversion mechanism, the electrode materials usually possess high theoretical capacity. As for the mechanism, the metal oxides react with the metal cations, inducing changes in the valence state and the phase of the anode material. Thus, during the conversion reaction process, the anode electrode often suffers from large volume change, which generally results in poor cycling performance. Alloying anode materials, such as Sn, Si, P, and Sb, have been widely investigated for metal ion batteries. The alloying reaction between the anode and metal ions provides high theoretical capacity, which causes severe volume expansion and poor cycling performance. Improvement strategies, such as nanocrystallization, coating, and compositing, have been developed to relieve the volume variation.48 Carbon-based materials such as AC, porous carbon, CNTs, and graphene are usually used as the cathode material for MICs.15,49–52 These materials usually need to have good conductivity, large surface area, tunable porous structure, good electrolyte accessibility, and so on.
 Fig. 4  Schematic diagram of the MICs devices, representative electrode materials, common electrolytes, and their attractive merits for advanced MICs. 
During charging, metal ions separate from the surface of the positive electrode material, and then insert into the negative electrode after passing through the electrolyte and the diaphragm. On the other hand, during discharge, the metal ions are extracted from the negative electrode lattice and pass through the diaphragm electrolyte returning to the positive electrode surface to constitute an electric double layer. The operating voltage window of the cell (ΔVcell) can be the sum of the potentials of the capacitive cathode (ΔVcathode) and the battery-type anode (ΔVanode). Similarly, the total charge stored in the device comes from both the battery anode (Qanode) and capacitive cathode (Qcathode). The equivalent capacitance of the MICs is composed by the cathode electrode capacitance (Ccathode) in series with the anode electrode capacitance (Canode), which can be expressed as the following equation.53 (1)
Since the anode capacitance is generally much larger than the cathode capacitance, the cell capacitance largely depends on the cathode capacitance.
Obviously, the imbalance between the high capacity of the battery-type electrode and the low specific capacitance of the physical adsorption/desorption electrode, and the mismatch between the low kinetics of the battery-type anode and the fast kinetics of the capacitive cathode will seriously affect the electrochemical performance of the MICs. To reduce these issues, a number of in detail, systematic, and scientific research works have been carried out. The proposed strategies are: (i) to construct specific nanostructures (includes size and morphological features), (ii) surface coatings with electronic conductive materials,48 (iii) make suitable composites, (iv) high surface area with proper porosity for anode and cathode materials, and (v) effective approach for presodiation or prepotassiation process, which is beneficial for compensating the poor efficiency in the first charge/discharge cycle, to obtain a high operating voltage, to reduce the internal electrode resistance, and diminish the electrolyte utilization during the continuous charge/discharge cycles. In addition, the mass ratio between the anode (battery type) and the cathode (capacitor type) plays an important role to increase the energy and power density, as well as the cycling life of the MICs.29,48 The mass ratio between the two electrodes can be calculated according to the charge balance equation:54 (2)where m, C, and ΔE are the mass of the active materials, specific capacitance, and working voltage, respectively. Nevertheless, many studies have reported that an optimal electrochemical performance can be obtained when the negative charge is in excess. They suggested that when the device is fabricated with high positive to negative ratio, a lower voltage can be reached in the negative electrode, resulting in large volume change and capacity decrease.26,29 The optimal negative/positive ratio and the mechanism of its impact on the performance still need further study.
3. Electrode materials for NLMICs
Among various MICs, LiICs is the most mature. However, the shortage and high costs of lithium sources have compelled researchers to develop other devices, such as Na+, K+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Zn2+, and Al3+-based capacitors as alternatives to Li+ ion-based energy storage systems. NaICs and KICs show similar properties to LiICs. The challenge is that the much larger radius of Na+ and K+ puts forward higher requirements for battery-type materials. Na+ has a smaller radius than K+, which probably shows better electrochemical kinetics in the battery-type anode and delivers charge storage performance comparable to LiICs. Thus, NaICs are the most reported in the recent years. KICs, due to the abundant reserves, low redox potential of K/K+, and small solvation radius of K+, which do not favor ionic transport in the electrolyte, have been considered to be a promising energy storage system. However, the availability of anode host materials is limited because K+ has a larger ionic radius. Multivalent ions including Mg2+, Ca2+, Zn2+, and Al3+ can provide more than one electron transfer during charge/discharge. These multivalent ions-based MICs are safer compared to the highly active alkali metals. In addition, the radii of these multivalent ions are either nearly equivalent to or smaller than that of Li+, which means little damage of the structure and good cycling stability. However, because of the strong interaction between the metal ions and the intercalation host materials, the diffusion of ions in the electrode materials is sluggish. In this part, we mainly review the electrode materials for various NLMICs devices and their priorities and challenges.
3.1 NaICs
The natural abundance of sodium is almost 2.64 wt% on earth and its environment-friendly nature makes it an alternative for Li-ion-based energy storage devices. Na+ shares similar physical and chemical properties with Li+, including the electronegativity, ionic nature, and electrochemical kinetics. However, the ionic radius of Na+ is higher than that of Li+, which may aggravate the dynamics difference between the faradaic anode electrode and the double layer capacitor electrode during the electrochemical reaction in the NaICs. Hence, the design of an appropriate anode material with fast Na+ ion intercalation/deintercalation plays a vital role for attaining high energy and power density NaICs.
To date, metal oxides/sulfides/selenides, MXenes, alloying materials (such as TiSb2, and NaBi), and carbon-based materials have been employed as the anode electrode material for NaICs.55 For instance, Y. Wang et al. prepared Na-doped MoS2–graphene composites (NaMoS2/G) based on the conversion reaction between MoS2 and Na+ through the presodiation process, which delivered a much higher capacity than MoS2/G (Fig. 5a and b).56 They have assembled the full cell using NaMoS2/G as both the positive and negative electrodes (symmetric device) with 1 M NaClO4 in propylene carbonate (PC)/ethylene carbonate (EC) as the electrolyte (Fig. 5c). The full cell exhibited a maximum specific cell capacitance of 250 F g−1 and good cyclic performance of 2000 cycles at a rate of 1.5C (Fig. 5d). Wang et al. prepared MoS2–AC nanocomposites using the hydrothermal method. The superior Na+ charge storage performance of the MoS2–AC composite can be attributed to the two-electron insertion process that enabled a characteristic pseudocapacitance, a stable solid electrolyte interphase (Fig. 5e).57 The NaICs fabricated using MoS2–AC as the anode electrode delivered a high energy density of 87.7 W h kg−1 and good cycling performance.

S. Dong et al. reported the in situ growth of Na2Ti3O7 on one-dimensional CNTs (NTO@CNTs) as the anode material for NaICs (Fig. 6a).58 The field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) image of NTO@CNTs depicted a unique one-dimensional coaxial nanocables structure (Fig. 6b and c). The NaICs were assembled using NTO@CNTs as the anode and peanut shell-derived AC as the cathode. Fig. 6d shows the galvanostatic charge–discharge curves (GCD) of the assembled NaICs at different current densities. Moreover, the device retained 79% of its original capacity after 2000 cycles (Fig. 6e) and delivered a high energy density of 58.5 W h kg−1 with a power density of 300 W kg−1 (Fig. 6f). In particular, Na2Ti3O7 nanosheets and urchin-like Na2Ti3O7 with unique structural features could offer more sodium ions/electrons access during the electrochemical reaction, which is beneficial for the Na+ storage of the electrode material. Chen et al. used a simple one-step template-assisted method to prepare interconnected sea urchin-like hollow Na2Ti3O7 (Na2Ti3O7–IcUH) chains (Fig. 6h).55 The resulting Na2Ti3O7–IcUH provided an excellent reversible capacity of 96.2 mA h g−1 at a current density of 5 A g−1 (Fig. 6i). Due to the dominance exposed for the (001) facet and the novel hollow structure, it shows huge advantage in fast Na+ storage. At the same time, the interconnected three-dimensional structure makes Na2Ti3O7–IcUH have good cycle stability (Fig. 6j). Song et al. synthesized carbon-coated sodium vanadium bronze nanotubes (Na–VBNT@C) and tested their Na+ ion storage properties.59 In particular, VOx nanotubes were first synthesized by the hydrothermal method. Next, the prepared VOx powders were used to prepare Na–VBNT@C via the sol–gel route. Due to the open ends, the electrolyte can penetrate the nanotubes, allowing Na+ ions to quickly intercalate into the inner surface of the nanotubes, and the wrapped carbon layer facilitates electrons to pass through the outer surface of the nanotubes (Fig. 7a and b). Therefore, Na–VBNT@C provides high reversible capacities of 209 and 105 mA h g−1 at rates of 0.1 and 10C, respectively. At the same time, it has excellent cycle stability. At a high rate of 5C, it can still maintain 94% of the initial capacity after 3000 cycles (Fig. 7c). Ding et al. prepared spinel NiCo2O4 by the chemical deposition process.60 NiCo2O4 has a typical agglomerated porous morphology with a large specific surface area (190.1 m2 g−1) and a large mesopore volume (0.943 cm3 g−1). The fabricated NiCo2O4//AC capacitor provided a maximum voltage window of 4.3 V and has excellent electrochemical performance at 3 V.

MXenes, a kind of new 2D material developed in the recent years, have exhibited high metallic conductivity, good mechanical properties, and tunable surface properties.61 MXenes have been expected to depict superior properties in electrochemical energy storage applications. Wang and co-workers reported the fabrication of titanium carbide for anode electrode materials for NaICs.61 After the sodiation process, the Ti2CTx sheets exhibited a structural change. During the first cathodic process in a nonaqueous Na+ electrolyte, the Na+ ion intercalated within the Ti2CTx sheets and expanded the interlayer distance from 7.7 to 10.1 Å. This allows reversible Na+ ion intercalation/deintercalation during the charge–discharge process of the NaICs. The Ti2CTx anode-based NaICs demonstrated excellent cycle life with 96% capacitance retention after 100 cycles and delivered a high specific capacitance of 245 F g−1. MXenes have also been studied as cathode materials for NaICs. Y. D. Agnese et al. reported the investigation of 2D vanadium carbides as the cathode electrode material for NaICs.62 They synthesized V2CTx by HF selective etching (Fig. 7d) and studied the energy storage mechanism by X-ray diffraction (XRD). The peaks at the (002) plane were continuous and reversibly shift from 9 to 12° in the potential range from 1.0 to 3.5 V versus Na+/Na (Fig. 7e), indicating that V2CTx store charges by inserting Na ions between the layers.
Carbon-based materials, due to its natural abundance, environmental friendliness, and high specific surface area, which reduces the ion diffusion transport length and decreases the diffusion resistance of Na+ during the charge/discharge process, have been widely investigated for NaICs. Most of the research works were reported based on carbon materials derived from natural resources (biodegradable waste).63–66 For example, Ding et al. used the inner part of the peanut shell-derived ordered carbon (PSOC) as the negative electrode, and the outer rough shell-derived carbon, i.e., peanut shell nanosheet carbon (PSNC), as the positive electrode to assemble NaICs (Fig. 8a).67 This peanut shell-derived carbon nanosheets exhibited a high surface area of up to 2396 m2 g−1 and 35.4% mesopores, which enabled rapid Na+ diffusion (Fig. 8b). This assembled device retained 72% of its original capacitance after 10000 cycles at 6.4 A g−1 (Fig. 8c). This degradation was attributed to the gradual ruin of the surface oxygen moieties rather than a bulk change in the carbon structure.

Prussian blue (PB) has been investigated as the positive electrode for the NaICs, which has two-electron transfer during the redox reaction.68 The reactions can be described as follows. NaxFeIIIFeII(CN)6 ↔ Na+ + Nax−1FeIIIFeII(CN)6 + e− ↔ 2Na+ + 2e− + Nax−2FeIIIFeII(CN)6(3)
This two-electron transfer enables more Na+ ion storage during the electrochemical reactions. In this case, high-quality PB was also synthesized using Na4Fe(CN)6 as the only iron-source through a simple one-step method. Due to the slow growth process, the obtained PB presented good crystal structure with only little vacancies, which reduced the lattice distortion and collapse of the CN bridge during Na-ion intercalation/deintercalation. The PB positive electrode delivered good cyclic stability, with only 3% degradation of the capacitance after 1000 cycles of charging/discharging at a current density of 0.5 A g−1.
Electrode materials, as one of the most important components in NaICs, have been extensively studied in the recent years. Anode materials are currently being investigated to determine the composition, morphology, size, and shape, which are expected to present suitable Na+ transport channels and good conductivity to facilitate charge transfer, thus alleviating the mismatch in the kinetics with the capacitive-type cathodes. In Table 2, we have summarized the reported results for NaICs.

3.2 K-ion capacitors (KICs)
The natural abundance of potassium resources is three times larger than that of its counterpart Li. In particular, the equilibrium potential of K+/K is −2.88 V in the nonaqueous-based electrolytes (propylene carbonate).69 This is lower than that of Li+/Li (−2.79 V) and Na+/Na (−2.56 V), which enables wider operating voltage windows. The hydrated ionic radius of K+ is very smaller than that of Li+ and Na+, which favors ionic transport in the K+ electrolyte.34 All these features of potassium encourage us to make K-ion-based energy storage devices.
Metal oxides, carbon-based materials, organic materials, and PB have been studied as the electrode (anode and cathode) materials for KICs.70 The anode plays a key role to increase the cycle life of the KICs where the parasitic reaction between the anode and electrolyte should be reduced. The titanate-based anodes (metal oxide) associated with the high operation potentials are known to be responsible for the ultra-long cycle life for the Li-ion and Na-ion batteries. In a similar way, K2Ti6O13 micro-scaffolds have been used as the anode material for K-ion capacitors. Dong et al. prepared hybrid KICs using K2Ti6O13 micro-scaffolds and nitrogen-doped nanoporous graphene carbon as the anode and cathode, respectively.71 The assembled KICs demonstrated excellent capacity retention of 85% after 1000 cycles, and delivered a high energy density of 58.2 W h kg−1 and a high power density of 7200 W kg−1.
Carbon-based materials such as carbon nanosheets, hollow carbon spheres, onion-like carbon, graphite, and carbon foam were studied as the anode materials for KICs.70,72–74 For instance, nitrogen-doped hollow carbon nanospheres were synthesized through polymerization cross-linking and then the pyrolysis carbonization route (Fig. 9a and b).72 Such hollow carbon nanospheres presented a micropore-dominated porous structure, facilitating the enhanced capacitive behaviors of the electrode. The calculated interlayer d-spacing of this hollow carbon is 0.417 nm (Fig. 9c). The wider interlayer spacing offered faster K+ intercalation/deintercalation during the charging/discharging process. KICs full cell based on this carbon nanosphere delivered a high capacity of 57.7 mA h g−1 at 0.05 A g−1 and a high energy density of 114.2 W h kg−1 at 100.5 W kg−1 (Fig. 9d). J. Chen et al. reported the synthesis of large interlayer spacing and oxygen rich carbon nanosheets (CNS) as the anode material for KICs.70 They have synthesized CNS through the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method with different temperatures (650, 700, 750, and 800 °C) and estimated the interlayer space (0.376, 0.396, 0.405, and 0.379 nm) of the CNS (Fig. 10a–d). It was interesting to note that not only the interlayer space but the functional groups played important roles on their K+ ion storage performance. The CNS had the meso and microporous nature with a high surface area. The constructed KICs using CNS as the anode material yielded a cell capacitance of 192 F g−1 at a current density of 0.5 A g−1 and retains 80% of its original capacitance after 5000 cycles (Fig. 10f). Moreover, the device delivered a high energy density of 149 W h kg−1 with a power density of 210 W kg−1 (Fig. 10e). Another significant nanostructure is onion-like carbon (OLC) obtained from the direct candle shoot, which shows an ordered and interconnected structure with a large interlayer spacing (Fig. 10g and h).73 Such an interconnected structure increases the electronic conductivity of the OLC and hence boosts the rate performance of the KICs device. The KICs full cell has been fabricated using OLC as the anode and homemade AC as the cathode material. The full cell yielded the highest energy density of 142 W h kg−1 at a power density of 210 W kg−1 (Fig. 10i) and retained 83% of its original capacitance retention after 6000 cycles (Fig. 10j). The abovementioned electrode materials have a high specific surface area, which tends to form a thick SEI film caused by the decomposition of the electrolyte, thus reducing the coulombic efficiency. To avoid this problem, prepotassiation is essential for anode materials.

It is worth noting that micro-sized graphite is a suitable anode material for KICs applications due to its highly reversible, durable, and fast co-intercalation of the solvated K+ from the electrolyte. Chang et al. used the reaction of K and CO to synthesize 3D K+ pre-intercalated graphene in one step.74 The obtained sample has a high specific surface area (990 m2 g−1), meso and microporous structure. A symmetric full cell device was fabricated using 3D graphene nanosheets as the electrode material. The constructed symmetric KICs displayed a high specific capacitance of 184 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1, an excellent reversibility, which can be confirmed by the continuous charge–discharge cycling with 90% capacitance retention after 3000 cycles.
A brief summary of the KICs results is presented in Table 3. Although there have been several works reported, the development of KICs still faces many challenges. Here, the redox reactions taking place during the charge–discharge process in the battery type electrodes are even slower than the non-faradaic reaction at the cathodes. This creates a dynamic imbalance between the battery type and the capacitor type electrodes. On the other hand, the availability of anode host materials is limited because K+ has a larger ionic radius. To overcome these issues, researchers have been committed to the design and development of electrode materials with high rate and power performance. It is of great importance for KICs to seek suitable electrode materials with appropriate ion transport channels and good electronic conductivity, which are conducive for reaction kinetics. In addition to the abovementioned widely-reported metal oxides and carbon materials, transition metal phosphorus, transition metal diselenides, PB, etc., have also been investigated for K+ storage.75 For example, molybdenum diselenide has the main attraction due to its lamellar structure with a large interlayer space of 6.40 Å, which aids the highly reversible K+ diffusion during the charge–discharge process.76

3.3 Mg-ion capacitors (MgICs)
Magnesium resources are inexpensive and can be found in a large amount than lithium. The ionic radius of Mg2+ is similar to that of Li+, which is suitable to replace lithium and to fabricate Mg2+-based electrochemical energy storage devices. During the electrochemical reaction, Mg2+ carries two electrons, which is twice that of Li+. Due to this bivalent cationic property of magnesium, the specific volumetric capacity of Mg is 3833 mA h cm−3 while Li metal can only reach 2046 mA h cm−3.77 These advantages stimulate researchers to work toward Mg2+-based batteries and capacitors. However, the strong electrostatic interaction between Mg2+ and the crystal structures of the electrode materials prevents reversible ion intercalation/deintercalation and slows down Mg2+ diffusion. Hence, it is important for Mg2+-based energy storage devices to explore suitable electrode materials. In the early stage, Mg2+ storage (MgTiO3) has been studied by type I ceramic capacitors.78 To date, carbon materials, metal carbides (MXenes), and metal oxides have been studied as electrode materials for MgICs.
Zhang et al. combined the nanowire structure todorokite-type organic modified silicas (Mg-OMS-1) and the sheet-like graphene to fabricate Mg-OMS-1/graphene composite material and investigated its electrochemical performance as the cathode materials for MgICs (Fig. 11a and b).79 The obtained composite depicted good electrochemical performance with capacity up to 194.1 mA h g−1 at 20 mA g−1 in the aqueous electrolyte. The good performance can be attributed to the following reasons: first, todorokite-type magnesium manganese oxide with MnO6 octahedra triple chains can provide large 3 × 3 tunnel structure, which offers enough room for Mg2+ ion storage. Second, the good electronic conductivity of graphene facilitated the fast transport of ions, thus improving the rate performance of the electrode. MgICs constructed by the Mg-OMS-1/graphene cathode and carbon molecular sieve (CMS) anode exhibited excellent cycling performance with 98.6% capacitance retention after 800 cycles. Besides, MXenes have also been studied as the electrode material for MgICs.80 MXenes get much attention for electrochemical energy storage applications due to their high electronic conductivity, packing density, surface modification, and ability to attain the more ion intercalation/deintercalation during the charge–discharge process. For instance, the Ti3C2Tx/rGO hybrid material has been measured using three electrode systems in 1 M Na2SO4 and 1 M MgSO4 aqueous electrolyte and presented good electrochemical performance.80 Another kind of MXenes are called as metal nitrides, which has the general formula Mn+1XnTx (n = 1, 2, 3), where M, X, and T are the transition metal, the nitrides, and the surface termination group (O, OH, and/or F), respectively. Djire et al. reported the Mg2+ storage performance of nanolayered Ti2NTx MXene for MgICs.81 The charge storage mechanism of Ti2NTx in the aqueous MgSO4 electrolyte in the half-cell configuration can be described as the following reaction. Ti2NOx(OH)y + Mg2+ + 2e− ↔ Mg[Ti2NOx(OH)y](4)

Ti2NTx nanolayered material delivered a specific capacitance of 204 F g−1 at the scan rate of 2 mV s−1 and showed an increasing trend of the capacitance (160%) against 1000 continuous charge–discharge cycles. This can be explained by the strong attraction of metal nitrides with Mg2+ in the aqueous electrolyte. Moreover, more active sites of the Ti2NTx electrode were activated during continuous cycling. These findings indicate that 2D metal carbides or nitrides are promising materials and appropriate for MgICs.
3.4 Ca-ion capacitors (CaICs)
Calcium is the fifth most abundant element on earth, is environment friendly, and has a high gravimetric capacity (1340 mA h g−1). In addition, Ca2+ holds the promise of faster reaction than Mg2+ due to its lower polarizing property and its low standard reduction potential of −2.86 V (vs. SHE) can offer high cell potential. Such factors suggest that calcium can be used in electrochemical energy storage technology. The calcium ion storage performance of CaCo2O4 has been studied as the cathode material for calcium ion battery. Such a fabricated device demonstrated a specific capacity of 100 mA h g−1. However, the cyclic stability is poor due to the slow diffusion of calcium ion.36,82–84 Wu et al. reported activated carbon as the positive electrode for calcium-ion hybrid energy storage devices (Ca-HSC).36 In this study, Ca foil was used as the anode and a solution of 0.8 M Ca(PF6)2 in EC, PC, dimethyl carbonate (DMC), and ethyl methyl carbonate (EMC) (2:2:3:3) was used as the electrolyte. The electrochemical performance of the fabricated Ca-HSC cells has been tested through cyclic voltammetry and charge–discharge techniques within the potential range from 1.5 to 4.8 V. During charging, the non-faradaic process occurred on the cathode, where PF6− anions from the electrolyte adsorbed on the AC surface. On the anode, the faradaic process took place simultaneously, with Ca2+ being absorbed by the metal foil to generate the CaxMy alloy (Fig. 11c). Then, PF6− anions desorbed from the AC cathode and Ca2+ dealloyed from the metal anode during discharging. Ca-HSC delivered the maximum capacity of 92 mA h g−1 at a current density of 0.1 A g−1. The Ca-HSCs delivered high cycling stability with 88% capacity retention after 1000 continues charge–discharge cycles and no obvious change in the charge–discharge curve or increase in IR drop.
To date, the research on Ca2+-based energy storage systems is still in its early stage. Due to the lack of a suitable combination of electrode materials and electrolytes, satisfactory performance has not been obtained on a complete calcium ion energy storage device. Even so, CaICs have received great attention from researchers owing to multiple electrons, superior kinetics, and abundance (2500 times that of lithium).85
3.5 Al-ion capacitors (AlICs)
Aluminum, the most abundant metal in the earth's crust, is placed in the p-block of elements and shows three electron-transfer during the charge/discharge process. The three-electron redox system (Al/Al3+) offers high theoretical gravimetric capacity (2980 mA h g−1) and excellent volumetric capacity (8040 mA h cm−3). Also, Al3+ has a smaller radius of 0.53 Å (Li+, 0.76 Å; Mg2+, 0.66 Å). Overall, the distinct features of aluminum encourage people to investigate Al3+-based ion capacitors. Z. Li et al. investigated PB as the electrode material for asymmetric AlICs.37 The asymmetric device constructed with the Al0.2CuFe–PBA cathode and AC anode delivered an energy density of 13 W h kg−1 with a capacity of 37 mA h g−1 and retained 90% of its initial capacity after 1000 cycles. The authors also examined the isotropic lattice strain for different cation intercalations in PB. In the case of K0.6Ni1.2Fe(CN)6·3.6H2O, there is a little difference in the strain between the cations of K+ (1.3%), Mg2+ (1.1%), and Ba2+ (0.9%), while it is only 0.18% for Na+ and 0.56% for Al3+, which may be related to the radius of the cations, differences in the intercalation site, or the exchange of water molecules in the hydration shells of the intercalants with the zeolitic water in PB. These results suggest that multivalent Al3+-based capacitors have great potential for the development of high-performance electrochemical energy storage systems.
W18O49 nanowires/single-walled carbon nanotube (SCNT) composite was used as the negative electrode material and SCNT/polyaniline (SCNT/PANI) was used as the positive electrode material for AlICs (Fig. 11d and e). The reversible and fast charge storage (faradaic redox reaction) mechanism for W18O49 is given by the following equation.86 W18O49 + xAl3+ + 3xe− ↔ AlxW18O49(5)
The assembled AlICs full cell yields a capacitance of 0.586 F cm−2 (21.1 F g−1) at a current density of 26 mA cm−2 and a high energy density of 19 mW h cm−3. In addition, the AlICs delivered good cycling stability with 95.9% initial capacitance retention after 6000 cycles of charge/discharge. Wang et al. reported the synthesis of polypyrrole-coated molybdenum oxide (PPy@MoO3) nanotubes, which were used as anodic materials for AlICs. The proposed Al3+ storage mechanism for molybdenum oxide is given in the following equation:87 MoO3 + xAl3+ ↔ 4AlxMoO3 (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.27)(6)
The broad redox peaks observed from the cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves indicated that the PPy@MoO3 nanotubes have a pseudocapacitance nature. The full cell assembled using PPy@MoO3 as the anode and AC as the cathode material delivered an energy density of 28 W h kg−1 with a power density of 460 W kg−1 and retained 93% of its initial capacitance after 1800 cycles. This enhancement may be ascribed to the layered structure of MoO3, the smaller ionic radius of Al3+ ion (0.53 Å), and the larger charge number per metal unit. No obvious voltage drop can be observed from the charge–discharge curves, indicating that the constructed AlICs have low internal resistance. Such behavior is considered to boost the power performance of the device. However, only few studies have been reported for AlICs so far. In order to understand the capacitance nature, further investigation is needed for AlICs.
3.6 Zn-ion capacitors (ZnICs)
ZnICs have received much attention due to their low cost, high capacity, environmental friendliness, and natural abundance. Metallic zinc has a moderate gravimetric capacity of 823 mA h g−1 and a much higher volumetric capacity of 5845 Ah L−1 when compared with the lithium electrode volumetric capacity (2046 Ah L−1). Moreover, zinc metal is much safer than extremely reactive Li, Na, and K in aqueous electrolyte. In addition, the zinc electrode demonstrates long-term life span in aqueous neutral electrolyte, which is viewed as appropriate for practical applications.41,88,89
To date, Mn-based oxides, V-based compounds, carbon materials, MXenes, and conductive polymers have been investigated as cathode materials for ZnICs.41 As for anodes, besides Zn foil, carbon materials such as CNTs and graphene can be applied as the anode materials. Recently, Wang et al. reported the design of ZnICs with MnO2–CNTs as the cathode material, MXene as the anode, and an aqueous-based electrolyte.89 The free standing MnO2–CNTs electrodes have been prepared through the ultrasonication and filtration process. Meanwhile, flexible MXene anodes were fabricated by directly filtering the MXene suspension. The fabricated ZnICs device exhibited a high energy density (67.8 W h kg−1) and power density (59.9 W kg−1), as well as good cycling stability. In addition, ZnICs fabricated with aqueous gel electrolyte exhibited excellent flexibility, which depicted only 5.4% capacitance degradation even at a high bending angle of 120°. Tian et al. reported the design of an aqueous ZnICs configuration, which consists of zinc anode, oxidized carbon nanotubes (O-CNTs) cathode, and 1 M ZnSO4 electrolyte.90 They found that O-CNTs delivered increased specific capacitance, which can be ascribed to additional electrochemical reactions/adsorption between oxygen-containing functional groups of O-CNTs and Zn2+ ions. Pure CNT and O-CNT electrodes were tested using cyclic voltammetry with aqueous ZnSO4 and H2SO4 electrolytes. The CV curves of pure CNT exhibit a typical rectangular shape and represent the ideal capacitance nature (electric double layer behavior). The O-CNT electrode demonstrates the quasi-rectangular CV curves, which indicates the pseudocapacitance nature of the prepared electrode material. Though both the electrolytes show capacitance features, the ZnSO4 electrolyte yields superior electrochemical performance due to its bivalent nature that enhances the specific capacitance. An et al. reported that surface-modified zinc foil (SM-Zn) was used as the anode material for ZnICs.91 The surface modification of zinc foil was carried out through the chemical etching process. The obtained SM-Zn displayed a distinct rough surface morphology (Fig. 12a–c). The surface roughness of the zinc foil was estimated to be 107.8 nm using an atomic force microscope (AFM). They achieved a high surface area without any changes in the chemical bonds and the crystal structure. The novel ZnICs fabricated using SM-Zn as the anode delivered a specific capacitance of 353 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1. In this work, the charge transfer kinetics were also tested using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (Fig. 12d). In the high frequency region, both SM-Zn and untreated zinc foil electrodes showed a semicircle, which was related to the charge transfer resistance. Here, both the modified and unmodified electrodes showed the same Rct values, indicating that the surface modification did not affect the electrical conductivity of the zinc foil. However, in the low frequency region, SM-Zn delivered the lowest Warburg impedance, indicating the enhanced ion diffusion ability during the electrochemical reaction. This device delivered a high energy density of 102 W h kg−1 with a power density of 400 W kg−1 and 99% of its initial capacitance was retained after 2000 charge/discharge cycles (Fig. 12e).

To date, most of the works have been carried out using carbon-based materials as the working electrode material for ZnICs.92 Wang et al. reported the design of ZnICs, which use AC as the cathode material and zinc foil as the anode material.35 The AC was derived from coconut shells, during which the raw material was initially pre-carbonized at 500 °C for an hour and then activated by KOH at 800 °C for an hour. N2 adsorption–desorption measurements showed that the prepared AC sample had a highly mesoporous nature along with a high surface area of 3554 m2 g−1. Electrochemical measurements were conducted within the potential range of 0–1.7 V (Fig. 12f). The ZnICs yielded a specific capacitance of 170 F g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 (Fig. 12g) and an energy density of 52.7 W h kg−1 at a power density of 1725 W kg−1. The lifespan of the device was evaluated using 20000 continuous charge–discharge cycles, which shows that 91% of the initial capacitance was retained (Fig. 12h). In addition, the coulombic efficiency of ZnICs was maintained at approximately 100%.
4. Electrolytes for NLMICs
For the practical applications of NLMICs, it is essential to increase the energy density without a loss of the power density. Such enhancement can be achieved by improving the cell capacitance and cell voltage, which are mainly dependent on the electrode materials and electrolytes (including the electrolyte salt and solvent). In earlier sections, we have discussed the electrode materials, and here we will discuss the importance of electrolytes for NLMICs. The properties of electrolytes have a great influence on the capacitance, the energy/power densities, the cycle life, as well as the thermal stability of the MICs. Factors to be considered in selecting a suitable electrolyte include the potential window, the ion conductivity, thermal and chemical stability, the match degree with electrode materials, the volatility and flammability, and cost (Fig. 4).93 Electrolytes used in NLMICs can be classified as aqueous and nonaqueous (organic and ionic liquid) electrolytes. Aqueous electrolytes have advantages such as low cost, do not require special conditions for use, and environmental friendliness. However, the narrow potential window of aqueous electrolytes limits the commercial applications of MICs. Organic electrolytes can operate at a high cell voltage but generally suffer from low ionic conductivity, high electronic series resistance (ESR), toxic nature, and flammability. With good chemically and electrochemically stability, negligible volatility, and non-flammability, ionic liquids hold promising applications in MICs. However, the low conductivity and high viscosity can significantly increase the ESR values, thus limiting the rate and power of devices. In addition, in the recent years, significant efforts have been devoted to research on quasi- and solid-state electrolytes, which could simplify the packaging process of the device and avoid potential liquid-leakage. However, its low ionic conductivity reduces the power performance of the MICs. In this part, we summarized the common electrolytes used for NLMICs.
4.1 Aqueous electrolytes
Aqueous electrolytes in NaICs have received extensive attention due to their advantages of safety, low cost, and environmental friendliness. Common sodium salts such as Na2SO4, NaNO3, and NaClO4 in water have been employed as electrolytes in NaICs. Han et al.64 have shown that cobalt hexacyanoferrate can be successfully used for aqueous NaICs. In this case, they used 0.5 M Na2SO4 aqueous electrolyte for device fabrication. The device can be operated in an extended potential range up to 2.0 V and delivered a specific capacitance of 98 F g−1 at 0.8 A g−1 and a high energy density of 54.4 W h kg−1 at 800 W kg−1. Zhang and co-workers developed an aqueous NaIC using a highly-concentrated NaClO4 (17 M) electrolyte.94 Due to the scarcity of free water molecules, the stability window of the concentrated electrolyte can be enlarged to approximately 2.75 V. To date, high salt concentration is a significant strategy to ensure high performance MICs in aqueous systems. For aqueous KICs, there are few works that have been reported compared to the corresponding Li+ and Na+-based systems. This can be ascribed to the large ionic radius of the K+ ions, which will causes irreversible pulverization of the active materials during the intercalation/deintercalation processes.95
Due to the easy passivation of magnesium metal in many conventional electrolytes, the development of Mg2+ ion-based energy storage systems was once hindered. Now, suitable electrolytes have been developed using the Mg2+ ion as the charge carrier, such as organomagnesium compounds, ionic liquid electrolytes, gel–polymer electrolytes, and solid-state Mg2+ conductors.96 Mg-OMS-1/graphene//CMS capacitor using 0.5 M Mg(NO3)2 as the electrolyte depicted good electrochemical performance in the voltage window of 0–1.8 V.79 Han et al. reported the design of redox bromide-ion additive aqueous MgICs by introducing the Br3−/Br− redox additive in 1 M MgSO4.97 Tian and co-workers developed printable MgICs using MgSO4–polyacrylamide (PAM) gel electrolyte.98 The as-prepared gel electrolyte can return to its initial state after various deformations, such as flattening, bending, and/or stretching. Such quasi-solid-state MgICs delivered a high working voltage of 2.2 V and can be integrated with GaAs solar cells, demonstrating high solar-charging cycling stability.
In AlICs, aqueous electrolytes with aluminum salts such as AlCl3 and Al2(SO4)3 have been widely used.99 For example, the P–TiO2-MRs//AC AlIC device has been fabricated using AlCl3 aqueous electrolyte, which delivered a high energy density of 26.3 W h kg−1 and excellent rate capability.100 For ZnICs, the use of safe and cheap aqueous electrolytes is dominant. Zinc salts such as ZnSO4, Zn(NO3)2, Zn(CF3SO3)2, and Zn(TFSI)2 have been widely used in ZnICs.101 For example, the MXene–rGO//Zn ZnICs configuration was constructed with 2 M ZnSO4 electrolyte.102 The full cell exhibited reversible charge/discharge in 0.2–1.6 V and a high energy density of 34.9 W h kg−1 as well as good cycling stability. Aqueous electrolytes show great convenience and safety for device fabrication. However, the narrow potential window and some undesired side reactions, such as O2 or H2 evolution, limit the energy density and cycling performance of the NlMICs devices.
4.2 Nonaqueous electrolytes
Nonaqueous electrolytes including organic and ionic liquid electrolytes have a wide potential window. Most NaICs have been tested through organic electrolytes with sodium salts such as NaClO4, NaPF6, sodium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (NaFSI), or sodium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (NaTFSI) dissolved in organic solvents such as EC, PC, EMC, DMC, and diethyl carbonate (DEC). These kinds of electrolytes can offer high potential range up to 4 V, which enhances the high energy density with high power density. Hard carbon anode-based NaICs was fabricated with an organic electrolyte.103 The cell yields a reversible volumetric capacitance of 5.6 F cm−3 at a volumetric current density of 5 mA cm−3 and it achieved a high volumetric energy density of 2.8 mW h cm−3 with a high power density of 160 mW cm−3. Similar to NaICs, potassium salts, including KClO4, KPF6, and potassium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (KFSI) dissolved in various solvents including EC:DEC, PC, and dimethoxyethane (DME), have been used as electrolytes in KICs. It should be noted that due to the weak Lewis acidity of K+, the interaction between the K+ and solvent molecules are weak, resulting in fast ion diffusion rate.104 Thus, the ionic conductivity of the potassium salt solution is higher than that of lithium and sodium salt solution.104 K+-based energy storage systems are expected to have good rate capability. Besides, the architecture of the electrode materials, K+ diffusion, and solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation on the electrode/electrolyte interface are also important for the rate performance of KICs.105
S. Moon et al. investigated the Mg2+ ion storage properties of nanoporous carbon with 0.5 M Mg(TFSI)2 in different organic solvents such as DME, ceric ammonium nitrate (CAN), DMC, and PC.106 The result showed that the solvent type has little influence on the specific capacitance, while significantly affecting the rate capability. Anyway, the systematic studies are still needed to exploit suitable electrolyte candidate for MgICs as well as other Mg2+ ion-based energy storage systems. Ca(PF6)2 dissolved in the mixed solution of EC, PC, DMC, and EMC with a volume ratio of 1:1:1:1 has been used as the electrolyte for CaICs.36 Besides, calcium salts with BF4−, ClO4−, and TFSI− anions dissolved in carbonate solvents, N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) are suitable for reversible Ca2+ insertion/extraction. The development of CaICs is still in its early stage. The investigation of reasonable electrolyte systems for CaICs still faces many challenges. For AlICs, with the consideration of the passivation of aluminum metal, AlICs with Al foil, foam, or alloy as the negative material should use non-aqueous electrolytes, such as AlCl3/1-ethyl-3-methylimidazole chloride ([EMIM]Cl) electrolyte.107 ZnICs with organic electrolytes were also studied. Zhang and co-workers developed a Zn(TFSI)2/Pyr14TFSI/AN hybrid electrolyte with a high voltage for ZnICs.108 Due to the synergistic advantaged of Pyr14TFSI and AN, the electrolyte could output a wide potential window of 3.32 V (vs. Zn/Zn2+). Other organic electrolytes for ZnICs such as Zn(CF3SO3)2 or Zn[(CF3SO2)2N]2 in acetonitrile (AN) have been reported.35,109 With non-aqueous electrolytes, the applied voltage of the fabricated device can reach 4.2 V or even higher, thus providing the property for a higher energy density. The properties of the salts and solvents, such as ionic size, conductivity, solubility, mobility, and stability, will greatly impact the performance of the devices.
In addition, the compatibility of the electrolyte and collector also needs to be considered. Different kinds of current collectors have also been tested in neutral electrolytes such as Ti-mesh, indium titanium oxide (ITO) film plates, stainless steel carbon clothes, carbon fabrics, and thin graphite foam.110 Normally Cu or Al-based current collector was often used in organic electrolytes. The aging of organic electrolytes degrades the Al-current collector, which greatly affects the electrochemical stability of the device. Hence, it is crucial for researchers to concentrate on the electrolyte types and current collector prior to the device fabrication. The summary of aqueous electrolyte-based MICs is presented in Table 4.

5. Device fabrication of NLMICs
Most of the reported MICs devices are fabricated into coin cell type with a battery type anode, a capacitor type cathode, and an aqueous or non-aqueous-based electrolyte. With the development of wearable electronic devices, nowadays, microsized, flexible, and wearable energy storage devices integrated with health monitors and electrochemical sensors have got great attention.111 Due to their good mechanical strength, compression stability, and high energy and power density, microsized MICs are the available microscale power devices.112 Microsized MICs devices are needed with specific requirements: (i) the fabrication process is well-suited to that of microelectrochemical systems for easy process integration. (ii) Three dimensional architectures should be developed and optimized within the limited foot print areas to enhance the electrochemical performance. (iii) The volumetric/areal specific capacitance is more important than the weight consideration of the microscale devices.
According to the assembly mode, microscale devices can be classified into 2D in plane, 2D stacked, 3D in plane, 3D stacked, and 1D fiber structural design.111 2D stacked microscale devices have been fabricated using anode and cathode thin films sandwiched together with the separator/solid electrolyte, which was shown in Fig. 13a. This sandwich design often suffers from short circuit, electrode dislocation, and increases the ion diffusion length (due to the thickness of the separator about 20 to 30 μm), which increases the ion transport resistance and reduces the power and energy of the MICs. For 2D in plane, the anode and cathode share the same substrate with the physical distance, which works on the separator. This occupies a larger area of the available area and also yields only half of the area specific capacitance compared with their 2D stacked counterparts (Fig. 13b). Planer micro-MICs with in-plane interdigital finger arrays design have some intrinsic worth in flexibility, reliability, and fabrication. They can be fabricated via a number of ways, from usual printing to advanced micropatterning technique. 3D in plane devices possess interdigital vertical arrangement (Fig. 13c) and 3D stacked microscale devices require column-type structure (Fig. 13d) on the single substrate. As a result, 3D microscale devices not only delivered higher specific cell capacitance but effectively shortened the ion diffusion paths, which can increase high power uptake and delivery within a short span of duration. It is worth mentioning that these merits make planar micro-MICs promising candidates for on-chip integration and powering microelectronics. In addition, conductive wires including CNTs wires, metal wires (platinum, titanium, and stainless steel), and textile fibers are also utilized in wearable devices due to their flexibility and mechanical stability. The conductive wires can act as the current collector of MICs and the active material can be loaded on the surface of the wires for fiber-shaped microdevices (Fig. 13e).

Recent investigation reported that Na2Ti3O7 urchin-like nanostructures (battery type electrode) can be used as the anode and peanut shell-derived carbon (capacitor type electrode) is used as the cathode for high energy and power density flexible NaICs devices.113 In this work they used the polyvinylidene fluoride hexafluoropropylene (PVDF–HFP) membrane as the separator, which was presoaked in the NaClO4–PC–EC organic electrolyte to fabricate the flexible quasi-solid-state device. The device delivers a maximum energy density of 111.2 W h kg−1 with a power density of 800 W kg−1 and sustains 3000 cycles. J. Lang et al. studied the flexible KICs device using the K–Sn alloy as the anode and AC as the cathode (Fig. 14a).114 PVDF–HFP and PEO membrane was soaked in KPF6 in EC–DMC–EMC organic electrolyte to form the gel electrolyte. Fig. 14b and c present the electrochemical performance of the device and practical applications. The flexible potassium ion hybrid device yields an ultra-high energy density of 120 W h kg−1 with a power density of 2850 W kg−1. In addition to this, the device delivers long cyclic stability (no degradation after 2000 cycles at 3.0 A g−1).

All solid-state planar sodium ion microcapacitors with multidirectional fast ion diffusion pathways have been reported by S. Zheng et al.115 They synthesized sodium titanate (NTO) from the continuous oxidation and alkalization of Ti3C2 MXene obtained from the HF etching of layered Ti3AlC2 (Fig. 15a). The characteristic XRD peak of the prepared NTO was upshifted at 2θ = 9.8° with an interlayer spacing of 0.9 nm. This interlayer gap offers more sodium ion storage at the electrode electrolyte interface. Activated graphene was used as the cathode material here, which was obtained from the KOH activation of 3D reduced graphene oxide aerogel made-up through the self-breeding combustion method. Activated graphene presents a high surface area of 2380 m2 g−1 with a mesoporous structure, which favors the rapid diffusion of the electrolyte ions and expands the accessibly available active surface for charge storage. The planar sodium-ion microcapacitors was fabricated using NTO as the anode, activated graphene (AG) as the cathode (NTO//AG), and an ionogel electrolyte. The interdigitated microelectrode of NTO and AG were constructed on flexible highly-conducting exploited graphene (EG, 1000 S cm−1) using mask-assisted filtration approach. The asymmetric interdigitated microelectrodes were built by consecutive layer-by-layer deposition. Here, EG is deposited on the bottom layer, the electrode material coated on the middle layer and again EG covered ultrathin and half-backed on the top layer to form highly stable sandwich electrode structure. The flexible NTO//AG device has been tested using different bending angles (Fig. 15b and e). The NTO//AG flexible microdevice works within the potential range of 0 to 3.5 V (Fig. 15c) and exhibited the highest volumetric cell capacitance of 19.5 F cm−3 at a current density of 0.1 mA cm−2 (Fig. 15d). The planar microdevice yields the high areal energy density of 12 μW h cm−2 corresponding to the power density of 0.9 mW cm−2. In addition, the cyclic test was performed using continuous charge/discharge cycles, which deliver a capacity retention of 75% after 6000 cycles.

6. Challenges and prospects
NLMICs have been reviewed and discussed in detail in this work, which includes the charge storage mechanisms, electrode materials, electrolytes, and devices. From our point of view, the following things can be focused on in future research about NLMICs.
First, the ionic radii of Na+ and K+ are higher than that of Li+, and presodiation/prepotassiation cause the volume expansion of the electrode materials. These properties decrease the electrochemical kinetics and cycling performance of anode electrodes. For multivalent NLMICs, the strong electrostatic interaction between the cations and electrode material crystal structures prevents the fast diffusion of cations and affect their power density. Hence, the exploration of suitable electrode materials with enlarged interlayer spacing or novel porous structure and abundant active sites should be continued. For example, it is feasible to design and fabricate electrode materials with suitable nanostructures and components by nanosizing, elemental doping, coating, and compositing. Nanosizing is an effective approach to reduce the ion transport distance, resulting in fast ion diffusion kinetics. Elemental doping can adjust the electronic structure of the materials, increasing the electric conductivity. Coating and compositing can effectively alleviate the volume expansion of the electrode materials during charge/discharge and improve the cycling stability. In addition, the development of new anode materials with large channels for ion transport is of significant importance, such as MXenes and conductive MOFs.
Second, the charge storage mechanisms and the electrochemical reaction kinetics of the electrode still need in-depth understanding. Some in/ex situ characterization techniques have been used to monitor the structure and phase elucidation of the electrode during charge/discharge, such as the in situ XRD, Raman, and transmission electron microscope (TEM). In addition, theoretical calculations can be conducted to assist in explaining the electrochemical properties and guide for the design of suitable electrode materials.
Third, as for the electrolytes, the existing electrolyte systems always suffer from a narrow potential window or low ionic conductivity, toxicity, and flammability. Thus, the development of safe and efficient electrolyte systems is very important. The following approaches can be attempted: the “water-in-salt” electrolyte could provide an expanded electrochemical stability window, which enables high energy. Appropriate redox additive could greatly elevate the performance of MICs. The reported aqueous/non-aqueous hybrid electrolyte provides us a brand-new electrolyte system as well as an inspiration for exploring new electrolyte systems.
Fourth, further investigation is needed for flexible and wearable NLMIC devices. In consequence, it is clear that NLMICs shows various merits including enhanced energy density compared to traditional capacitors and good power performance. Thus, NLMICs can be used for a wide range of potential applications such as micro, flexible, and wearable energy storage devices integrated with health monitors, electrochemical sensors, and multifunctional smart electronics applications.
Last but not least, cost consideration is the key to the success of innovation. Therefore, the preparation of electrode materials and electrolytes, and construction of MIC devices through a low-cost, environment-friendly process is also the focus of future research.
