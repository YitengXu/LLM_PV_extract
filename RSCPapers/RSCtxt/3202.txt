    , Accepted 2nd August 2019First published on 10th August 2019AbstractColloidal perovskite nanocrystals, or quantum dots (QDs), have quickly emerged and exhibited unique opportunities for optoelectronic applications. This is due to their excellent optical and photovoltaic properties as well as composition tunability. Currently, there are only a limited number of publications correlating QD synthesis optimization with relevant device performance. Here, CsPbI3 QDs have been successfully synthesized and displayed improved optoelectrical properties by implementing an in situ ytterbium (Yb) doping strategy during synthesis. Systematic investigations were carried out to examine the effects of Yb-doping. Preliminary experimental results indicated that Yb3+ lanthanide cations could effectively reduce the number of defects and trap states caused by surface and lattice vacancies. This result contributes to an improvement in QD photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY), material crystallinity, thermal stability and carrier transport. Consequently, the solar cells adopting optimally Yb-doped CsPbI3 QDs achieved the best power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 13.12% and displayed significantly improved storage stability under ambient conditions. These results indicate that in situ doping has great potential to improve the quality of the resultant perovskite QDs. This approach can provide a new path to a breakthrough in QD based solar cell technology.
1. Introduction
Recently, fully-inorganic perovskite nanocrystals, also known as quantum dots (QDs) with CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I, or a mixed halide) stoichiometry, have quickly emerged and attracted wide attention for applications in light-emitting diodes, solar cells, and other applications like lasers and catalysis.1,2 This is due to their extensive nanocrystal size adjustability, wide absorption range, high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY), and especially their variable luminescence over the entire visible spectrum.3–7 Nanomaterials possess new engineering advantages, providing the freedom to alter energy levels, improve solution processing techniques, and optimize material composition management. Over the past decade, organic–inorganic hybrid lead (Pb) halide perovskite semiconductors have gained tremendous attention for photovoltaic applications.8–12 Power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of perovskite thin film solar cell devices have rapidly increased from 3.6% to 24.2%,13 quickly becoming a rising star in the field of solution-processed photovoltaic devices. Despite the rapid progress, high-efficiency organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites (e.g. CH3NH3PbI3) have been found to quickly dissociate into PbI2 and CH3NH3I3, which are volatile under environmental stresses.14–16 This instability has become a bottleneck for further developments. Relative to conventional hybrid perovskites, all-inorganic perovskite materials such as CsPbI3 have been reported to possess an improved thermal and phase stability.17,18 However, these perovskites usually require a high annealing temperature (>350 °C) to obtain the ideal cubic phase.19,20 These challenges warrant additional research to push this technology forward.
QD engineering offers unique features for device fabrication and manufacturing. Additionally, the enhanced stability of the crystalline phase will open new avenues for perovskite photovoltaic technologies and other possible applications. Solution-processed solar cells using CsPbI3 perovskite QDs were successfully reported by J. M. Luther et al.21 in 2016 using room temperature layer-by-layer processing under ambient conditions. These QD films initially showed a PCE of 10.77% with a high open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.23 V. These encouraging features make these materials a promising alternative in perovskite technology for light harvesting and applications in optoelectronic devices. More importantly, they found that CsPbI3 QDs are stable in their cubic phase in solutions for months with ambient storage and the QD films are relatively stable in their cubic phase in low humidity environments. This result is significantly superior when compared to their bulk perovskite-film counterpart. QDs protected by surface ligands demonstrated enhanced air and phase stability. Nonetheless, long insulating ligands (e.g., oleate) are harmful for dot-to-dot carrier transport and overall PCE.22,23 During solar cell fabrication, long-chained ligands are typically exchanged with shorter ones in a process called ligand exchange. The ligand exchange process normally will introduce defects on the QD surface. Fortunately, compared to colloidal lead chalcogenide QDs, CsPbX3 QDs exhibit a much higher defect tolerance24 as the PLQYs are normally reported in the range of 80–95% in the green-red region.25 However, it should be noted that the defect states within the QDs could still hinder carrier transport and stability.
In this study, CsPbI3 QD solar cells were fabricated based on QDs with/without (w/wo) ytterbium (Yb) lanthanide doping. Yb-doped CsPbI3 QDs demonstrated various performance enhancements (efficiency and ambient stability) in comparison to pristine CsPbI3 QDs. Based on the results of absorption, photoluminescence (PL), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) characterization, it was tested and confirmed that Yb-doping could enable in situ passivation on the QDs. The doping effectively reduced the number of defects and trap states caused by surface and lattice vacancies. Therefore, the passivated QDs could effectively decrease carrier recombination and improve charge carrier transport. These enhancements resulted in a best solar-to-electricity conversion efficiency of 13.12% combined with improved device stability in ambient environments. These results exhibit the potential of precursor engineering in the optimization of QD synthesis and device efficiency. It also provides a new apparatus to further improve the performance of optoelectronic devices based on perovskite nanocrystals.
2. Results and discussion
As illustrated in Scheme 1, Yb-doped CsPbI3 QDs are synthesized in a nitrogen gas atmosphere via a classical hot-injection method.3 They are synthesized by adopting the following reported protocols: oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OLA) as the ligands, PbI2 as the lead source, Cs-oleate as the cesium source, ytterbium acetate (YbAc3) as the Yb-dopant, and 1-octadecene (ODE) as the dispersion agent. The concentrations of PbI2 (0.036 M), OA, OLA, and Cs-oleate are all kept constant throughout the experiment. The entire reaction is conducted in a nitrogen gas atmosphere. After injecting the Cs-oleate, at a reaction temperature of 165 °C, the dark-red solution is immediately cooled in an ice-water bath and transferred into an N2-filled glovebox for purification.

To demonstrate the effects of Yb-doping on the optical, structural, and compositional properties of the CsPbI3 QDs, detailed characterization experiments were performed. As seen in Fig. 1, the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images display monodisperse CsPbI3 QDs synthesized via in situ Yb-doping. To confirm the inclusion of Yb3+ ions in the QDs, the spatial distributions of Cs, Pb, I, and Yb species were further tested and revealed using a high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscope (HAADF-STEM).26 In Fig. S1,† the four elements are homogeneously distributed throughout the QDs, suggesting the successful doping of Yb3+ cations. Also as illustrated in Fig. S2,† the EDS spectrum again indicates the inclusion of Yb3+ cations in the CsPbI3 QDs.
 Fig. 1  (a–f) TEM images of the CsPbI3 QDs synthesized with increasing Yb-doping concentrations (inserts are high-resolution TEM images). 
To explore and identify the optimal doping concentration of Yb3+ in CsPbI3 QDs, a series of reactions with varying conditions were set up. These settings included the doping of YbAc3 at molar concentrations (relative to PbI2) of 0%, 5%, 10%, 20%, 30% and 50%. All of these reaction systems are capable of producing the CsPbI3 nanocubes, as verified by the TEM characterization. In Fig. 1, the morphologies of the synthesized QDs seem independent of the Yb-precursor concentrations, since there are no significant differences in the nanocrystal size. All crystals have a diameter of about 10 nm, with the size histograms computed and shown in the insert of Fig. 1. The doping of impurity ions in semiconductor nanocrystals has been a promising tool to control the electronic, magnetic, and optical performances of QDs. Previous work27 reported that doped lanthanide ions in CsPbX3 (X = Cl or Cl/Br) perovskite QDs tend to occupy the Pb2+ site. They were also commonly found to remove the Cs+ and Cl− lattice vacancies. Quite recently, Sun et al. provided the first experimental evidence that validates this theory.28 In comparison to Pb2+, the slightly smaller Yb3+ is estimated to increase the structure's tolerance factor and enhance its stability.8 The size distribution of different QDs varies with the use of different dopants. However, there is no observed increase in the size range for QDs synthesized at higher Yb doping concentrations in our work.
To confirm the nanocrystal size distribution and further investigate the doping concentrations' impact on the QDs' optical properties, a series of optical characterization experiments were performed. As shown in Fig. 2a, the concentration of dopant exhibits negligible effects on the solution under daylight and UV illumination. The UV-vis absorption spectra, which are presented in Fig. 2b, show almost no shift in both the first excitonic peak position (∼670 nm) and the absorption edge, further confirming the similar QD size and size distribution. In addition to measuring the QD solution's optical properties, a set of tests were also performed on the QD array film. As shown in Fig. S3,† the first excitonic peak and absorption edge of the thin film based on pristine CsPbI3 QD and 20% Yb-doped CsPbI3 QD are almost identical. The optical bandgaps of the QD films are extracted from the Tauc plot29 in Fig. S3† with a value of 1.770 (±0.003) eV and 1.773 (±0.003) eV for the pristine and 20% Yb-doped CsPbI3 QDs, respectively. Meanwhile, very similar PL spectra were obtained and are shown in Fig. 2c. The PL peak positions and the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of all tested materials displayed negligible differences when increasing the Yb-doping concentration. In a hexane solution, the dynamic PL lifetime of these doped CsPbI3 QDs was measured using time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL). The results are shown in Fig. S4.† At a doping concentration of 20%, the PL lifetime reaches a peak value of 45.4 ns. Since the QD PL lifetime is directly proportional to the number of surface trap states,30 the enhanced lifetime values in all Yb-doped QDs indicate an improvement in the material surface conditions. XRD analysis was performed to investigate the crystalline structures of the pristine- and Yb-doped CsPbI3 QDs. Fig. 2d depicts the XRD patterns with different Yb doping concentrations. All of the diffraction peaks can be well indexed to the cubical structure of the CsPbI3 and no additional phases can be found. This confirmed that the Yb atoms are well incorporated into the nanostructure and do not alter the original crystal configuration. Additionally, an observed increase in peak intensity in the (100) and (200) planes with Yb-doping suggests an improvement in the degree of crystallinity. This enhanced crystallinity indicates a decreased number of defect sites, which is beneficial for achieving improved charge transport.31 A slight shift of the (200) plane diffraction peaks was also observed towards higher angles when increasing the Yb doping concentration (see the highlighted region in Fig. 2d), indicating a slightly decreased crystal lattice constant. This may be attributed to the smaller ionic radius of Yb3+ (0.088 nm) compared to Cs+ (0.167 nm), Pb2+ (0.119 nm), and I− (0.220 nm). For ABX3 type perovskite materials, the tolerance factor (η) can be calculated with the following equation:32

Through doping Yb ions with a smaller ionic radius, the tolerance factor can be increased, suggesting improved phase stability in Yb-doped CsPbI3 QDs compared to the pristine material.
XPS and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) were performed to explore the surface composition of CsPbI3 QD films before-and-after Yb-doping. The detailed analysis, which can be seen in Fig. S5,† demonstrates that the spectra of Cs 3d, Pb 4f, and I 3d orbitals in both samples can be well fitted with identical dominant peaks, suggesting that the Yb3+ doping does not distort the local binding environment. Fig. S6† shows an additional peak from the 20% Yb-doped sample at 182.4 eV, which can be attributed to the Yb 4d orbital.33 Moreover, the atomic ratio of Yb/Pb extracted from XPS is 2.7%, similar to that of the Yb-doped CsPbCl3,28 again validating the successful doping. The UPS results of the QD films w/wo Yb-doping are shown in Fig. S7.† Both the Fermi level and valence band (VB) slightly up shift for the Yb-doped CsPbI3 QD film relative to the pristine CsPbI3 QD film. The calculated VB values of the pristine and 20% Yb-doped CsPbI3 are −5.60 eV and −5.50 eV, respectively. Together with spectroscopic and structural studies, it was found that structural changes caused by Yb doping largely influenced the material's electrical and optical properties. As shown in Fig. 3a, pristine CsPbI3 QDs a relatively low PLQY value of about 75%. According to previous work, the number of defects or trap states generated in the pristine CsPbI3 has been reported as a result of the lower PLQY value in CsPbI3.32 Expectedly, the PLQY of CsPbI3 increased when Yb was doped into the QDs. At a molar concentration of 20% Yb3+ doping, the PLQY value peaks at approximately 86% and decreases when higher Yb doping concentrations are used. Recent work demonstrates that the doping of lanthanide ions (e.g. Eu3+) into CsPbCl3 nanocrystals can reduce the non-radiative recombination through the reduction of defects and trap sites.33 Herein, the improved PLQY could be attributed to the decrease of defects in the Yb-doped materials. At higher Yb-doping concentrations, we hypothesize that more Ybi defects would be produced,31,34,35 accounting for the gradually decreasing PLQY value. Fig. 3b shows the chromaticity diagram which reveals the optical color information of the undoped and Yb-doped CsPbI3 QD solutions. This figure illustrates the Yb-doping impact on the optical properties of these perovskite QDs.

To further gain insights into the photocarrier dynamics in CsPbI3 QDs after Yb-doping, two-dimensional (2D) time-resolved PL spectrum testing was employed.36 In this work, CsPbI3 QD solutions w/wo Yb-doping were characterized under an excitation of 365 nm femtosecond laser pulse at room temperature. Fig. 4a and b illustrate the 2D TRPL response of the QD solutions from 480 to 720 nm after excitation. In both samples, the PL peak is located at ∼1.59 eV and the spectrum shapes are independent of the time elapsed after excitation. Fig. 4c compares the 1D TRPL decay of the two QD solutions. The Yb-doped CsPbI3 QDs exhibited a slower decay and an increased average decay time of 51.4 ns relative to that of 44.3 ns in pristine CsPbI3 QD solutions. As shown in Table S1,† the fitting results of 1D TRPL indicate that both the intrinsic NCs material and surface defects decay get to slowly as synthesized with Yb-ions. This indicates a reduced trap-state density in the doped QDs and less lattice distortion after modification with Yb-ions. Reduced carrier trapping in surface defect states can further suppress the high-temperature PL quenching of colloidal QDs, which is ideal for fabricating stable optoelectronic devices.37–39 Temperature-dependent PL measurements were performed on the three CsPbI3 QDs (0%, 5% and 20% Yb-doping) in a toluene (∼0.5 mg mL−1) solvent to further confirm this finding. As shown in Fig. 4d–f, at room temperature all QD solutions aggregated and dispersed, exhibiting a strong and narrow PL emission peak at ∼680 nm. With a gradual increase of temperature, the QDs start to dissociate and their PL peak intensities began to decline. The drastic decrease in the PL emission intensity of the pristine QDs indicates poor thermal stability. In comparison, in 5% and 20% Yb-doped QD solutions, PL peak intensity gradually increased with the rise in temperature. In solution, the tendency of QD dissociation in the three samples is in the order of 0% > 5% > 20%, which corresponds to the increase in the doping concentration. In the 20% Yb-doped solution, the PL peak only decreased to ∼50% of its initial value, suggesting an improved thermal stability and increased interactions between the doped QDs. Through Yb-doping, the QDs displayed a reduced number of vacancy defects, strengthening their lattice stability against their environment's temperature gradient.

Finally, the photovoltaic performances of Yb-doped CsPbI3 QDs were investigated when adopting the device structure of glass/fluorine-doped tin dioxide (FTO)/TiO2/CsPbI3 QDs/PTB7/MoO3/Ag (Fig. 5a).40Fig. 5b shows that each constituent layer of the device can be identified in the cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image. A compact TiO2 layer is synthesized by a chemical bath deposition process and serves as the electron transporting layer.41 PTB7 is employed as the hole transporting layer. The light absorbing Yb-doped CsPbI3 QD film is deposited by a layer-by-layer process. The details of the device fabrication are presented in the Experimental section. Fig. 5c indicates that the Yb-doped CsPbI3 QDs contain a more preferable energy level alignment in solar cell devices in contrast to the pristine QDs. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of QD solar cells based on Yb-doped CsPbI3 QDs, as a function of doping concentration (0–50% molar ratio), were measured under AM 1.5G illumination. The plot can be viewed in Fig. 5d. The corresponding device parameters are summarized in Table 1. The reference device with the pristine CsPbI3 QD film exhibited a best PCE of 12.06% with a high Voc of 1.25 V, a current density (Jsc) of 12.86 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.75. These data clearly indicate a device performance dependency on the doping concentration of Yb. There is a distinct variance in the Jsc values in the doped devices; however, the Voc and FF values remain almost constant.

The 5% Yb-doped CsPbI3 QD solar cells exhibit a Voc of 1.25 V, a Jsc of 13.25 mA cm−2, a FF of 0.75, and a best PCE of 12.42%. The 10% Yb-doped CsPbI3 QD solar cells exhibit an improved Jsc of 13.81 mA cm−2 and a PCE to ∼13%. Increasing the doping concentration to 20% results in the most optimal performance output. The sample generates a Voc of 1.25 V, a Jsc of 14.30 mA cm−2, a FF of 0.74, and a PCE of 13.12%. Further increasing the doping content to 30% or 50% results in a gradual regression in device performance, with a PCE of 12.54% and 12.27%, respectively. All solar cells based on doped QDs outperform those based on the undoped material. The increased Jsc value after doping can be attributed to the improved charge transport and decreased charge recombination within the QD film.18,35 The external quantum efficiency spectra (EQE) of the optimized pristine CsPbI3 and 20% Yb-doped QD solar cells are shown in Fig. 4e. In comparison with the reference device, solar cells based on the Yb-doped CsPbI3 QD film exhibited higher EQE values in the entire absorbing range of 350 to 700 nm, suggesting more efficient exciton extraction in the cell. The integrated current density (J) values over the AM 1.5G solar spectrum for pristine and 20% Yb-doped CsPbI3 QDs are 12.48 mA cm−2 and 13.30 mA cm−2, respectively, which are consistent with their measured Jsc values.
For the practical application of solution-processed solar cells, it is crucial to investigate the long-term stability of the device. Previous work has demonstrated that the CsPbI3 QD film exhibits a significantly improved ambient stability relative to bulk CsPbI3 films. However, these films are only relatively stable when they are in the cubic phase and in low humidity (less than 10%) atmospheres.42–44 To further improve device stability, it is important to passivate the QDs in order to reduce the number of trap states. Trap states act as a primary benefactor which impairs device performance during storage.17,25,45 The device stability was tested in an ambient environment (temperature: ∼20 °C and relative humidity: ∼20–30%) without any form of encapsulation. The measurement indicates that both the Yb-doped QD film and solar cell device exhibit an increased resistance to moisture and oxygen in comparison to its pristine counterpart. This result is consistent with the decreased number of defects and traps found in the doped QDs, indicating that the Yb-doping strategy could simultaneously improve the stability of both the QD film and relevant optoelectronic devices.33,37,46 As shown in Fig. 4f, after one week of storage, there was only a 40% and 32% efficiency drop under ambient conditions for the 20% and 50% Yb-doped devices, respectively. Under the same conditions, the pristine QD experienced a PCE decrease of approximately 70% of its initial value. These results are illustrated in Fig. S9, S10 and Table S2.† XRD analysis was performed to demonstrate the correlation between the stability degradation and the phase stability of the CsPbI3 QDs, which can be seen in Fig. S9.† After 7 days of storage under ambient conditions, more diffraction peaks appeared in the pristine CsPbI3 QD film sample, which corresponds to the orthorhombic phase.9,17,47 In contrast, the 20% Yb-doping effectively suppressed the transition from cubic to orthorhombic phase in the QD films. Defects in the perovskite crystal lattice can not only cause non-radiative recombination, they may also lead to device stability issues.48 We speculate that the Yb-doping could stabilize the CsPbI3 crystal lattice, and the tolerance factor was adjusted to a more suitable value, which indicate that a better perovskite structure was achieved. All these improvements could prevent the damage from moisture in QD films.
3. Experimental
3.1. Chemicals and materials
The chemicals used in this study are as follows: Cs2CO3 (99.9%), 1-octadecene (ODE, tech. grade, 90%, J&K), oleic acid (OA, tech, grade, 90%, Alfa), oleylamine (OLA, tech. grade, 90%, Alfa), PbI2 (99.99%, Alfa), YbAc3 (99.9%, Sigma), hexane (95%, J&K), methyl acetate (MeOAc, anhydrous 99.5%, Sigma), 1-octane (anhydrous, 99.8%, Sigma), and PTB7 (1-Materials). All the chemicals were used as received.
3.2. Synthesis and purification of CsPbI3 and Yb-doped CsPbI3 perovskite QDs
PbI2 (0.5 g) and ODE (25 mL) are added into a 100 mL three-neck round-bottom flask. The solution is then slowly heated to 90 °C and vacuumed for at least one hour. The flask is then filled with N2 and heated to 165 °C. Once this temperature is reached, OA (2.5 mL) and OLA (2.5 mL) are injected. The flask is then kept under N2 flow at 165 °C for 10 minutes. Finally, the Cs-oleate (4 mL) is swiftly injected and after a reaction time of 5 seconds, the solution is quickly cooled using an ice bath. In the Yb-doped CsPbI3 QD synthesis, differing amounts of YbAc3, including 5%, 10%, 20%, 30% and 50% molar concentrations (relative to PbI2) are added in combination with the Pb-precursor and ODE. The remaining steps are identical to the standard CsPbI3 synthesis. The details of preparation and purification can be found in the ESI.†
3.3. Fabrication and characterization of perovskite solar cells
QD solar cells were fabricated using our recently reported device structure of FTO/TiO2/perovskite QD/PTB7/MoO3/Ag. A 40 nm TiO2 layer was first deposited using a chemical bath deposition process onto pre-patterned FTO glass substrates. The TiO2 film is exposed to UV-ozone for 10 minutes. The CsPbI3 QDs w/wo Yb-doping (75 mg mL−1 in 1-octane) are spin-cast onto the substrate at 1000 rpm for 20 seconds followed by 2000 rpm for 15 seconds. Next, a few droplets of MeOAc are dropped onto the QD film, and then spun at 2000 rpm for 40 s. This procedure is repeated 3 times to build up ∼300 nm thick films. The CsPbI3 QD film was then dripped into pure MeOAc, and dried with N2. The MeOAc treatment can act as a ligand exchange process, which can remove the attached ligands on the perovskite QD surface such as long organic oleic acid and oleylamine. This process is performed in an air ambient environment at a temperature of around 20 °C with relative humidity below 10%. A PTB7 (10 mg mL−1 in chlorobenzene) solution is spin-cast at 2000 rpm for 40 seconds in a N2(g) filled glovebox. The device is then annealed at 80 °C for 10 minutes. Finally, 8 nm MoO3 and 100 nm Ag electrodes are deposited by thermal evaporation. The active area of the device is defined as 7.25 mm−2 through a shadow mask.
The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the devices were obtained using a Keithley 2400 digital source meter under a simulated AM 1.5G spectrum at 100 mW cm−2, with a solar simulator (Class AAA, 94023A-U; Newport Corporation). The light intensity was calibrated using a National Renewable Energy Laboratory-certified Oriel reference cell (91150 V). Solar cell devices were measured in forward scan (−1.3 V to 1.3 V, step 0.0125 V, scan rate: 0.1 V s−1) in an N2 filled glovebox. The stabilized PCE value was taken for each device.

4. Conclusions
In this work, the synthesis of efficient and stable CsPbI3 QDs via an in situ Yb-doping strategy is reported. A systematic investigation was implemented to examine the effects of Yb-doping on the QD properties. Through this investigation, it was revealed that by using YbAc3 as a dopant during QD synthesis, Yb3+ lanthanide ions have tendencies to occupy the Pb2+ site, as well as remove Cs+ and I− vacancies. As a result, the numbers of defects and trap states caused by surface and lattice vacancies were found to be reduced. This work demonstrates that Yb-doping provides great potential in improving QD PLQY, crystallinity, transport and thermal stability. QD solar cells adopting an optimal 20% Yb-doped CsPbI3 achieved the best PCE of 13.12% and demonstrated a largely improved stability under ambient conditions. This increased stability can be attributed to the reduced recombination and improved charge transport of the QDs due to doping. Moreover, it is proved that the synthesis of QDs is a critical step and has abundant room for optimization to further improve the quality of the emerging perovskite QDs. By rationally engineering the surface chemistry, breakthrough in efficiency for QD based solar cells and optoelectronic devices can be realized in the future.
