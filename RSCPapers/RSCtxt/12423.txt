    , Accepted 4th May 2023First published on 5th May 2023AbstractMetal–organic gels (MOGs) are an emerging class of materials and potential candidates for electrochemical applications because they have the advantages of large surface areas, designable and tailorable structures, active metal sites, and mild synthetic conditions. In addition to pristine MOGs, MOGs have been converted into derivatives such as porous carbons and nanostructured metal oxides. The utilization of MOGs, MOG derivatives, and MOG nanocomposites with graphene, conductive polymers, and others has been studied in various electrochemical applications and there is a need for an exhaustive review that covers all the genres of metal–organic gels for electrochemical applications. This review focuses on electrochemical studies of MOGs in energy conversion and storage techniques. The latest progress in MOG materials for electricity/ion conductors (electrolytes), energy storage, and conversion (electrocatalysis, supercapacitors, and batteries) is summarized, and future developments in this rapidly advancing field are presented.
1. Introduction
A gel, as defined by IUPAC, is a non-fluid colloidal network or polymer network that is expanded throughout its whole volume by a fluid but behaves like a solid due to its three-dimensional (3D) cross-linked network. Gel materials are among the most widely studied functional materials and significant progress has been made in the fields of sensing,1–5 medicine, biology,6 and the environment.7,8 Presently, gels that are suitable for electrochemical applications are being explored.9 Gels exhibit interesting features, including low density, high specific surface area, and hierarchical porous structures. These features enable the gel matrix to include various active centers in the network structure, thereby promoting mass transfer in electrochemical processes. The use of gels can endow materials with new physical and chemical properties. Gels can provide many active sites for adsorption/desorption, benefiting from their porous structures with large specific surface areas. At the same time, gels can be used as conductive platforms to promote electron transfer and electrochemical processes.10,11 Conductive gels have potential applications in flexible electronic devices.12–15 Because of the composition design and the unique porous nanostructure inherited from gels, gel-derived materials exhibit diverse electrochemical activities.13,16 Remarkably, the nanostructured gel network is an ideal platform for the development of new materials. Gels can be derived into various materials (e.g., carbon and oxide materials) by thermal treatment or chemical activation.
Metal–organic gels (MOGs) are mainly assembled from metal ions and organic linkers through self-assembly, via dynamic metal–organic coordination forces along with other non-covalent intermolecular interactions (hydrogen bonding, π–π stacking, hydrophobic interactions, host–guest interactions, etc.).17,18 The gel network has liquid void spaces that can hold a lot of solvent molecules to form a self-supporting gel-phase material. MOGs, as an essential class of organic–inorganic hybrid materials, are composed of metal ions and organic ligands and are easy to synthesize and process under mild conditions. Considering their viscoelastic properties and stimuli-responsive behaviors,19 an extensive exploration of MOGs is needed to benefit from the specific electronic, magnetic, redox, and catalytic activities associated with the coordination centers and void space available within the porous gel network. MOGs have recently received significant attention because they can be applied in sensing,20–26 adsorption (remediation of wastewater),27–32 drug delivery,33,34 and catalysis.35–39
MOGs offer great flexibility to achieve structural control and functional diversification through the self-assembly of metal ions and organic ligands. MOGs are readily decorated with functional electroactive groups. For materials, the available surface area and active sites affect their activity.40 MOGs are composed of nanoscale objects with many defective metal sites, providing abundant catalytic sites and exposing more active sites to the substrate and electrolyte. However, the electronic conductivity of metal-containing coordination polymers is intrinsically poor. Composites/hybridizing with electroactive components is an important strategy to improve the performance of MOGs. Conducting materials or electroactive components can be incorporated into the liquid part of MOGs to improve their low inherent conductivity. At the same time, to achieve good electrochemical performance, it is necessary to design electroactive sites in the structure. Entrapping conducting materials or electroactive components in the gel network also improves the conductivity of gels.41
Recently, MOGs have been applied in various electrochemical fields, such as conductors, electrocatalysts, and energy storage devices (batteries and supercapacitors). MOGs are studied as electrolyte components and electrode materials. Some MOGs have recently been employed as electrolytes, even if most MOGs are insulating materials. (1) With the development of clean energy resources, energy generation, and storage systems, MOGs have been used as electrocatalysts in sustainable and environmentally benign energy-conversion technologies, and energy conversion electrochemical reactions, including fuel cells, solar cells, water splitting and CO2 reduction. (2) Batteries and supercapacitors have great potential as power supplies in portable electronic devices and electric vehicles. Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have been commercialized in the market, while different rechargeable batteries are potential energy storage systems. Batteries with low cost, high efficiency, high energy density, and durable materials are promising candidates. MOGs show potential for applications as electrodes in supercapacitors and batteries, such as LIBs, lithium–sulfur batteries, and so on.
Although there are some recent review articles in the field of MOGs,16,42–46 a review that comprehensively focuses on the electrochemical applications of MOGs is not available. In this review, we survey the up-to-date research development of MOGs and their applications in the electrochemical fields to promote future breakthroughs (Fig. 1). Synthesis strategies and relationships between morphologies and electrochemical properties of MOGs are summarized. First, we summarize the characteristics of MOGs and introduce the conductance properties of MOGs, and then introduce the application of MOGs in electrocatalysis, including the HER, OER, ORR, and so on, in batteries and supercapacitors. Finally, the possibilities and challenges of developing MOGs in synthesis and application are discussed. Moreover, an outlook for the future development of MOGs is also provided. We hope to provide valuable starting insights for exploring MOG materials in electrochemical fields.

2. Metal–organic gels
MOGs are prepared by linking organic ligands through metal ions. Some MOGs have the dual features of metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) and gels.47 MOGs have structural diversity and tailorability, tunable hierarchical porosities, high surface area, and diverse morphologies. MOGs are divided into two categories, MOGs of coordination polymers and MOGs of discrete coordination molecules.48,49 Coordination bonding is the main driving force for coordination polymer-based MOGs, while for the second category, coordination bonding is mainly involved in the formation of discrete coordination molecules, and other supramolecular interactions are responsible for the gelation. Due to the non-covalent nature of the interactions, MOGs have stimuli-responsiveness toward external physical stimuli and chemical stimuli such as temperature, pH, light, shaking, and sound.50 Some MOGs display gel-to-sol transitions or exhibit self-healing properties.51 MOGs and MOFs are both coordination polymers, where the non-covalent connectivity of an organic ligand to a metal ion extends into structural ordering in MOFs.
Carboxylate-based gels (e.g., 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylate and 1,4-benzenedicarboxylate) are the most frequently applied within the family of MOGs (Fig. 2). The first metal-carboxylate MOGs (referred to as FeBTC hereafter) were reported to be assembled from Fe3+ ions (using Fe(NO3)3·9H2O) and 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylate (H3BTC).52 A series of metal-carboxylate gels were assembled from various carboxylic acids and metal ions.53–58 For example, AlBTC MOG was synthesized from Al(NO3)3·9H2O and H3BTC.53 The formation of FeBTC and AlBTC gels is primarily due to the coordination of the organic ligand to the metal ion extending into a complex polymeric network. ZrBDC MOGs were assembled from 1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid (H2BDC) based on UiO-66 (Zr6O4(OH)4(1,4-benzenedicarboxylate)6) nanoparticles.54–56 Besides carboxylates, several organic ligands are used to assemble MOGs, including pyridines59–63 and ligands of biological interest.45 MOGs are built from various metal ions, including transition metal ions,64 lanthanide ions,65–68 and main group metal ions.69–71 The diverse building blocks (metal ions and organic linkers) allow the adjustable chemical structures of MOGs. In addition, metal–organic cages and metal–ligand clusters,72–74 and metallic aggregates75 are efficient at constructing gels and enhance the cross-linking level. Because one or more metal sources can be uniformly distributed across the matrix of MOGs, it is possible to assemble multiple metal ions at the nanoscale with excellent chemical homogeneity while avoiding complicated and time-consuming processes. Various or mixed metal ions can be incorporated into MOGs as catalytic sites to improve the catalytic performance. In addition, functional additives can be integrated into MOGs but do not function as gelation elements. MOGs can be used to load metal nanoparticles,76,77 quantum dots,35 and polyoxometalates78,79 to yield hybrids/composites. For example, silver nanoparticles/MOGs hybrids have been employed for surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) application76 and catalysis.80 Phosphomolybdic acid/MOG-Cr composites have shown the visible-light-induced photodegradation efficiency of organic dye contaminants.78

MOGs have the characteristics of mild synthetic conditions, simple equipment, and low cost. The process of MOG precursor fabrication is simple. MOGs can form at room temperature and atmospheric pressure in a short reaction time. The synthesis of MOGs is a low-temperature, timesaving, cost-effective, and green method. The gelation process may consist of two steps (Fig. 3).53,81 First, MOF nanoparticles or amorphous metal–organic nanoparticles are formed based on coordination bonding between metal ions and ligands. Second, MOF/amorphous nanoparticles aggregate to a gel state via coordination interactions and other supramolecular interactions,43 including hydrogen bonding, π–π stacking, and hydrophobic interactions. The formation of gels is usually confirmed by the “test-tube inversion test”. During the second gelation stage, non-directional assembly occurs among the nanoparticles and interconnected interstitial spaces are generated. The mismatched growth of MOF/amorphous nanoparticles can be regulated by temperature, synthesis time, concentration, and solvent. MOGs of MOF nanoparticles have microstructures of short-range order and long-range disorder. Sometimes, long-range disorder may be observed as well. As a result, the wet gels have a hierarchical architecture.46 The porosity of MOGs has a microstructural origin, not as strictly crystalline as MOFs. Gelation can provide porosity, and a simple and straightforward molding for any metal–organic system, including those with interesting properties but no porous crystal structure.

Metal–organic aerogels (MOAs) are prepared from MOGs after supercritical drying or freeze-drying. The gels are dried in air resulting in metal–organic xerogels. The MOA materials have a higher degree of porosity and looser structure than xerogels. MOAs are monolithic materials with low density, large inner surface space, and high hierarchical porosity. MOGs/MOAs feature amorphous and less elucidated structures than MOFs.82,83 For MOGs/MOAs, highly porous structures provide accessible active centers and promote electrocatalytic reactions. Their interconnected coherent network structure, large surface area, and high mesoporous/macroporous structure are conducive to charge and mass transfer and are conducive to gas diffusion. MOGs/MOAs provide large surface areas of active sites that yield highly efficient electrocatalysts. Using porous MOGs/MOAs as electrocatalysts improves the activity per mass. In macro-/meso-/microporous gel electrodes, ions can be quickly transported into micropores through the macro-/mesoporous structures, thus enhancing mass transport.
The porous properties of MOGs can be transferred to derived materials. MOGs act as suitable precursors or sacrificial templates to achieve carbons, particularly heteroatom-doped carbon materials, or oxides. MOG-derived materials with heteroatom-doping, such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur, can enhance electrochemical performance. For example, Xia et al. reported the preparation of derived carbon products via the direct pyrolysis (high-temperature treatment) of AlBTC MOGs with a hierarchical architecture (Fig. 4).84 The morphology and microstructure of carbon products derived from these gels are similar to those of gel precursors. Fewer macropores are present for xerogel-derived materials (bulk density 0.1185 g cm−3), while a high proportion of macroporosity is possible for aerogel-derived materials (0.0952 g cm−3). A porous carbon matrix is usually composed of interconnected nanoparticles. MOGs can be carbonized to fabricate metal oxide-doped nanoporous carbons.85 Porous carbon/boron nitride composites derived from AlBTC/boron nitride composites have been developed as energy-saving materials.86 Nitrogen-doped porous carbon materials have been obtained via the direct carbonization of nitrogen-containing MOG Cr-MOG-NH2 ([Cr(OH)(BDC-NH2)]) (BDC-NH2 = 2-amino-1,4-benzenedicarboxylate) as a matrix to aid the sensing of small biomolecules in laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry.87 The resulting N-doped granular carbon has high toluene adsorption capacity.88 As crystalline microporous materials, MOFs can also form derived carbons or oxides with the controllable introduction of heteroatoms. MOF-derived materials may retain the ordered characteristics with ordered metal arrangement and well-defined interior voids.89,90 In comparison with the MOF-derived materials, the MOG-derived materials show ease in achieving hierarchical porosity with mesopores and macropores, and potential in processing capabilities to construct specific complex structures.

3. Metal–organic gels as conductive materials
Conductive materials are commonly used in electronic and electrochemical energy conversion and storage devices. Electrical conductivity allows the efficient transport and migration of charges and ions in porous materials.91 Conductive materials are divided into electrical conductors and ionic conductors according to their mechanism and application. As customizable porous materials, MOGs have been designed and explored as promising conductive materials. Generally, MOGs are porous materials with low conductivity; however, with specific structural design, such as the introduction of electroactive building blocks, the sedimentation of electroactive functions, and their compounding with conductive components, MOGs can be converted into conductive materials. MOGs with 3D porous structures usually have high surface areas, and they can load conductive components,92 thereby improving their conductivity.
Conductive MOGs can be classified into different categories, such as ionic and electronic conductive gels.93 Herein, ion-conductive gels, conductive supramolecular gels, and conductive coordination polymer gels are discussed. Ion-conductive gels include electrolyte-based ion-conductive gels, ionic liquid-based ion-conductive gels, and proton-conductive gels. The mobility of ions is responsible for the ion conductivity in ion-conductive gels. MOGs contain a large amount of liquid so that massive conductive ions can be dispersed throughout the whole gel matrix. The 3D coherent porous channels of gels facilitate ion transport/migration throughout the gel.91,94 Conductive supramolecular gels and conductive coordination polymer gels have intrinsic networks of conducting nanostructures. They are afforded electronic conductivity from a supramolecular polymer or a conducting coordination polymer. For coordination polymer gels, the interconnected 3D network enables electron transfer to achieve electrical conductivity. Due to the movement of metal ions, and the collective effect of morphological and rheological properties, conducting gels combine the 3D structures of gels with the electrical properties of semiconductors. The conductive property of MOGs plays a crucial role in developing electrolytes for batteries and electronic devices.
3.1. Ion-conductive gels
MOG-based electrolytes have been developed (Fig. 5). MOGs have been used as gel electrolytes to develop quasi-solid-state dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) that feature compact structures and electrolyte leakage-free properties. AlBTC/FeBTC and other gels have been used as electrolytes by absorbing liquid electrolytes. For example, Fan et al. prepared AlBTC-based gel electrolytes for quasi-solid-state DSSCs.95 AlBTC MOG has a spongy porous matrix formed by the coordination of Al3+ and H3BTC. The spongy, porous network is comprised of nanosheets with solvent molecules occupying the void spaces. The pores between TiO2 nanoparticles in the photoanode film are filled with the gel electrolyte. The ionic conductivity is up to 7.43 mS cm−1 (Fig. 6). The short-circuit current density (JSC) increased from 11.09 to 17.10 mA cm−2 with the increasing concentration of the active redox couple (I−/I3−). The gel electrolyte achieved a high conversion efficiency of 8.69%, which is slightly lower than that of a liquid battery (9.13%). Sarwar et al. also applied AlBTC MOG as gel electrolytes for DSSCs to achieve an efficiency of 6.06%.96 The stability of the gel electrolyte-based DSSCs is better than that of liquid-based DSSCs under thermal stress at 60 °C after 250 h. The liquid electrolyte-based cells decay by 24% in efficiency after 300 h, while the gel electrolyte-based cells maintain 94% of their initial efficiency. Dong et al. developed Al-TBP MOG of Al3+ and 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) as a quasi-solid-state electrolyte for DSSCs.97 For the gel electrolyte with the optimized Al3+/TBP molar ratio of 0.20/1.0, the conversion efficiency was 8.25%, JSC was 17.08 mA cm−2, the open-circuit voltage was 704 mV, and fill factor was 0.70. Zhang et al. applied FeBTC MOG as a quasi-solid-state electrolyte for DSSCs.98 FeBTC MOG has a flower-like porous structure with large void spaces in the gel network. The detailed photovoltaic parameters of the fill factor (0.67), JSC (12.70 mA cm−2), open-circuit voltage (626 mV), and photoelectric conversion efficiency (5.31%) were obtained for FeBTC-based DSSCs. The photoelectric conversion efficiency of 5.31% approached that of liquid electrolyte-based DSSCs (6.53%). Selvaraj et al. applied gellan gum gel electrolytes with Co-MOF incorporated for DSSCs.99 Co-MOF (synthesized from H2BDC and Co2+) with rod-like morphology can improve the conversion efficiency of the DSSCs device. A high JSC of 6.51 mA cm−2 and conversion efficiency of 3.42% were obtained for the electrolyte material consisting of an aqueous gel host, Co-MOF additive, and Cu+/Cu2+ redox mediator.

When ionic liquids are immobilized in gel materials, ionogels are formed. Ionogels retain the conductivity of pristine ionic liquids. Šantić et al. reported a series of ionogels of ionic liquids of various cations (imidazolium/pyrrolidinium) and anions (tetrafluoroborate/bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide) using (S,S)-bis(amino alcohol)oxamides as gelators.100 The gelation of [C4mim][N(Tf)2] with 1 wt% of (S,S)-bis(phenylalaninol)oxamide resulted in an ionogel. The optically transparent ionogel is stable over a wide temperature range (−70 to 80 °C), highly conductive (0.0032 Ω−1 cm−1 at 20 °C), and mechanically robust (G′ = 278 kPa at 20 °C). When poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) was introduced into a coordination polymer gel Pd-MOG, a hybrid gel electrolyte PVA-Pd-MOG was obtained that showed self-healable properties.101 Pd-MOG was assembled from Pd2+ and bisbenzimidazole L1 (Scheme 1). The ionic conductivity of the PVA-hybrid gel was 1.5 × 10−4 S cm−1. The PVA-hybrid gel achieved fast self-healing capacity in mechanical (180 s) and electrochemical (60 s) aspects.

During the formation of MOGs, inorganic acids (e.g., HNO3) may be produced. For proton-conducting MOGs, the charge carriers are transported via proton exchange. Phosphate and sulfonate groups are common functional groups for improving proton conductivities (Fig. 5). Aiyappa et al. synthesized a proton-conducting MOG of Fe3+ and phytic acid (PA, Scheme 1) with phosphate groups in DMF.102 The Fe-PA gel nanospheres, 20–40 nm in size, merged to form 1D nanofibers, which were interwoven into a 3D network. The Fe-PA xerogel had a high proton conductivity of 2.4 × 10−2 S cm−1 at 120 °C. When a fuel cell was assembled with the xerogel as a solid electrolyte, the power density was 0.94 mW cm−2 at 0.6 V.
The proton conductivity of MOGs has been studied. Tang et al. presented Zr-fumarate xerogels (Zr6O4(OH)4(fumarate)6) assembled from ZrOCl2 and fumaric acid.103 Defective compositions can be adjusted by formic acid. The xerogels exhibited anhydrous proton conduction in an extensive temperature range (233–433 K) with high stability. The conductivity was 5.68 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 233 K and 1–3 orders of magnitude higher at 393 K. The high proton conductivity is driven by high connectivity in xerogels, increased defective acid sites, and hydrogen bonding between guest water molecules and defective sites in the network. The Zr-fumarate gel serves as a sensor for detecting formic acid vapor via a proton conduction mechanism. It has a wide linear range (150–5500 ppm) with high anti-interference ability. Zheng et al. reported that Zr-1,2,4-BTC MOG of ZrCl4 and 1,2,4-BTC are good proton conductive materials.104 At 303 K and 75% RH, the proton conductivity of Fe-1,2,4-BTC MOG (1.61 × 10−3) was higher than that of Fe-1,2,4-BTC MOF prepared from the same raw materials (7.70 × 10−4). Because Fe-1,2,4-BTC MOG has less crystallinity than Fe-1,2,4-BTC MOF, the formation of more proton transfer channels can improve proton conductivity. The proton conductivity of Fe-1,2,4-BTC MOG was 1.50 × 10−2 S cm−1 at 353 K and 75% RH, and 4.55 × 10−2 S cm−1 at 303 K and 100% RH. This shows that the proton conductivity increased with the increase in temperature and humidity, and the proton conductivity was as high as 8.53 × 10−2 S cm−1 at 353 K and 100% RH. Qiu et al. reported that MOG assembled from Cr3+ and sulfonated terephthalic acid (BDC-SO3Na) had a proton-conductive 3D nanostructured network.105 The Cr-MOG had a 3D continuous network consisting of crosslinked nanoparticles of 10–20 nm in size. Interconnected voids were arranged in a disorderly manner in the hierarchical porous structure. Due to the negatively charged interconnected network, the ionic Cr-MOG showed a low activation energy of ca. 0.3 eV and ca. one order of magnitude higher proton conductivity (10−3 S cm−1) than that of its MOF pellet counterpart. Panja et al. reported that pyridine-coupled mono and bisbenzimidazoles L2 and L3 produced gels in the presence of Ag+ ions only across a range of tested metal ions.106 Ag-MOGs of L2 and L3 are used as conducting electrolytes to exhibit thermally activated ionic conductivity because Ag+ ions move within the gel network under an applied electrical field.
Mahendar et al. prepared a series of MOGs using Zn2+ and the diacylhydrazone-based derivative H2TEP treated with different bases (MOH, M = Li+, Na+, K+, Cs+).107 MH-Li gel has an intertwined nanofiber structure of about 20 nm in diameter. Rheological measurements showed that the gel becomes weaker depending on different alkali metal ions of Li+ > Na+ > K+ > Cs+. The conductivity is related to the rheological property. EIS tests showed that the AC impedances of MH-Li, MH-Na, MH-K, and MH-Cs were 237, 137, 92, and 75 Ω, respectively, and the corresponding conductivities were 1.36 × 10−2, 1.44 × 10−2, 1.53 × 10−2 and 1.60 × 10−2 S cm−1. The more potent gel MH-Li has a lower conductivity while the weaker gel MH-Cs has a higher conductivity because ionic species in the gel of Cs+ have increased ion mobility.
Zn2+-folic acid MOG was assembled from deprotonated folic acid and ZnCl2 in ethylene glycol-H2O.108 Feng et al. reported that Zn-folic acid MOG can be included in hollow thermoplastic elastomer (TPE) microfibers via coaxial spinning (Fig. 7). To form a core-sheath conductive fiber, Zn-folic acid MOG and TPE were chosen as the conductive core component and sheath constituent, respectively. The sol–gel transition of the Zn-folic acid MOG is rapid and reversible under shear stress so that the fiber has a stable conductivity of 3.6 mS cm−1 after large deformation. Ionic conductivity increases with increasing temperature due to accelerated ion migration. The fibers are used as sensors for wearable sensor applications. The fibrous strain sensor can be worn on human joints over a wide temperature range of 223–323 K.

3.2. Conductive supramolecular gels
Supramolecular gelation is an effective way to control the spatial arrangement of π-conjugated organic molecules. The gelation of π-conjugated organic molecules can induce electrical conductivity, which originates from supramolecular interactions between gelators. This catalogue of gels combines the stimuli-responsiveness of supramolecular systems with conductance.
Naphthalimide and naphthalenediimide, as exemplary semiconducting moieties, have been designed as gelators for MOGs. Chen et al. reported the naphthalimide compound NDH with the 4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1,3-diol moiety.109 When treated with sonication, NDH and alkali metal salts (Li+, Na+, K+, Rb+, and Cs+) formed a series of gels in pentanol. The NDH/LiCl gel had a rod-like structure, while NDH/LiClO4 gel showed a flake-like structure. When the NDH/LiCl solution and the NDH/LiClO4 solution were immobilized on the GCE electrode, RCT was 134.3 Ω and 42.85 Ω, respectively (Fig. 8). When the NDH/LiCl gel and the NDH/LiClO4 gel were modified onto the GCE electrode, RCT was more significant at 214.8 Ω and 90.2 Ω, respectively. N-substituted-1,8-naphthalimide derivatives L4–L6 formed gels in the presence of Ag+via coordination between pyridyl groups and Ag+ in DMF–H2O.110 The L4-Ag+ gel had a rod-like cluster structure, while the L5-Ag+ and L6-Ag+ gels displayed rock-like and fibrous morphologies, respectively. The L4-Ag+ gel exhibited the best ion transport characteristics. It showed the highest dc conductivity σdc of ∼9.35 × 10−4 S cm−1 and ion diffusivity of 8.58 × 10−8 cm2 s−1 at room temperature.

Dipeptide-appended naphthalenediimide (NDIP) self-assembled to form soluble aggregates in an aqueous solution at pH 7.5, and further assembled to form hydrogels in the presence of Ru3+ at pH 4.6 or glucono-δ-lactone (GDL) at pH 4.7.111 The morphology of the aggregates showed nanovesicles of 70–130 nm in diameter, and the morphology changed from nanovesicles to an interlinked nanofibrous network structure for the Ru3+-mediated gel. Current–voltage (I–V) studies of the self-assembled materials showed semiconducting properties. Schottky-type behavior was evident for the NDIP-Ru3+ gel. For the Ru3+-gel, the photoconductivity and the gain in photocurrent improved by several orders of magnitude. The dark current was about 118 and 2.3 times higher for the NDIP-GDL gel and the NDIP-Ru3+ gel, respectively. For the NDIP aggregates, the photocurrents for the NDIP-GDL gel and the NDIP-Ru3+ gel were about 291 and 18 times higher than the aggregates. The photocurrent gain (Ion/Ioff ratio) was 1.08 for the aggregate, 2.67 for the NDIP-GDL gel, and 8.64 for the NDIP-Ru3+ gel.
A two-component organogel comprising N,N-ditridecyl diimide (PDI-13) and TCAT was reported by Guan et al. to assemble supramolecular nanofibers.112 TCAT is an arylene ethynylene tetracyclic π-conjugated molecule with tetradecyl-substituted carbazole corners. TCAT has entangled 1D whisker-like nanofibers, while PDI-13 forms elongated thin sheets tens of microns long. The two-component gel showed more substantial entangled nanofiber bundles. The nanofibers with donor–acceptor co-assembly exhibited well-balanced hole and electron mobilities. The maximum hole and electron mobilities were up to 1.35 × 10−2 and 1.02 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, under ambient conditions.
3.3. Conductive coordination polymer gels
Conducting coordination polymer gels can act as insulators, semiconductors, or conductors due to their diversity in conductivity. Kurth et al. reported metallo-supramolecular coordination polymer electrolytes (MEPEs) assembled from transition metal ions (Fe2+, Co2+, Ni2+, and Zn2+) and ditopic ligand 1,4-bis(2,2′:6′,2′′-terpyridin-4′-yl)benzene (L7) in aqueous solution.113 Fe-MEPE revealed entangled fiber bundles 1.3 ± 0.2 nm wide and hundreds of nm to microns long. MEPE growth kinetics follow a reversible step-growth mechanism. The polymerization rate constants follow the order of Co-MEPE < Fe-MEPE < Ni-MEPE. KOAc can accelerate the growth of MEPEs. When metal acetate solution is added to the ligand solution, the conductivity decreases. The conductivity of the acetic acid solution (75 vol%) (200 ± 15 μS cm−1) is significantly lower than that of the acetic acid solution containing the ligand (580 ± 15 μS cm−1). The conductivity is a minimum when the metal ion-to-ligand ratio is 1.00 (Fig. 9).

Gelation may cause unprecedented improvement in conductivity for coordination polymer gels. Mahendar et al. synthesized a MOG by mixing adipic acid-derived ligand H2AL, LiOH, and Co(OAc)2 in DMF.114 H2AL was deprotonated with LiOH, and an M:L = 2:2 complex was formed during the gelation (Fig. 9). The gel has a branched fibrous morphology and the highly entangled fibers were ca. 100 nm in diameter. The resistance decreased from 11.3 kΩ for AL2− to 4.2 kΩ for the gel. The conductance property of the gel may be attributed to the organized fibrous network. Ultrasonication increased the resistance to 5.1 kΩ, however, heating to 125 °C led to a decreased resistance of 1.6 kΩ because the metal ion mobility increased.
Chain-length-selective gels of succinic acid (n = 2, H2SL) and adipic acid (n = 4, H2AL) derivatives were achieved among diacylhydrazone-based dicarboxylic acid derivatives.115 The LiOH-deprotonated H2SL (SL2−) and the addition of Cd(OAc)2 resulted in the formation of fluorescent MOG. TEM showed nanospheres (ca. 50 nm in diameter) that aggregated to form a fibrous network. Due to the well-organized fibers, the resistance of the H2SL/Li+/Cd2+ gel (3.6 kΩ) was lower than that of the counter non-gelling combination (5.6 kΩ) as revealed by the Nyquist impedance diagram.
A Li+-based MOG was produced from the phenylsuccinic acid-derived ligand H2PSL and LiOH in DMF (Fig. 9).69 The treatment of the non-fluorescent H2PSL with LiOH not only contributed to the gelation but also originated from the intense fluorescence through chelation-enhanced fluorescence and aggregation-induced emission. SEM and TEM revealed the sequential creation of nano-nuclei followed by nanospheres and their arrangement in forming fibers of ca. 3, 31 and 40 nm in diameter. The Nyquist impedance of the gel indicated that the resistance increased from 7.4 kΩ to 8.5 kΩ when ultrasound was applied. Ultrasound caused the gel network to be interrupted. In contrast, heating at 70 °C decreased the resistance to 4.8 kΩ, probably due to the easy flow of ions in the gel network.
Ultrasound induced the formation of stimulus-responsive MOG from citric acid-derived ligand L8, LiOH, and Cd(OAc)2 in DMF.116 Ultrasound triggered the formation of cross-linked nanofibers (ca. 20 nm) as characterized by AFM and TEM. Impedance measurement revealed that the conductance property of the Li+-Cd2+-L8 gel changed upon sonication, accompanied by a ten-fold decrease in resistance from 15938 to 1724 Ω, or a tenfold increase in conductivity from 4.5 to 40.6 mS m−1. Sonication also triggered the formation of the Cd2+-based CdA-OX MOG by mixing Cd2+ and oxalic acid in DMF.117 Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) analysis revealed that the gel has a pebble-like layered hierarchical architecture. The semiconducting material has been applied in electronic devices. The I–V characteristics of the metal–semiconductor (MS) junction device of the CdA-OX thin film exhibited a nonlinear curvature with a rectification ratio of the order of ∼102. Sonication also triggered the formation of the Mn-OX gel, which was produced through the mixing of Mn2+ and oxalic acid in DMF, followed by sonication.118 FESEM analysis revealed that the gel has an interconnected flakelike network. The I–V characteristics of the Mn-OX thin film MS junction device exhibited a nonlinear curvature with a rectification ratio of ca. 34.
A series of metal-triethylenetetramine/tris(2-aminoethyl)amine/-monoethanolamine gels were reported by Dhibar et al. for potential Schottky barrier diode (SBD) application. FeTETA MOG was produced by the instantaneous mixing of Fe3+ and triethylenetetramine (TETA) in water at room temperature.119 The gel has an agglomerated cashew-like structure. The semiconducting gel has been applied in an SBD device. Its electrical conductivity is 1.003 × 10−4 S m−1. The synthesis of FeMEA MOG was achieved by mixing monoethanolamine (MEA) and Fe3+ in water under ambient conditions.120 The FeMEA gel showed the microstructural compactness of the hierarchical network as shown by FESEM. The electrical conductivity was 3.18 × 10−4 S m−1. The I–V characteristics of the FeMEA-based device showed an SBD nature with a rectification ratio of 375 (Fig. 10). The CoMEA hydrogel was produced from an aqueous solution of Co2+ and monoethanolamine.121 FESEM and TEM analyses revealed an interconnected hierarchical nano-flower architecture consisting of fibers for the CoMEA gel. The semiconducting gel shows potential for application in SBD devices. The conductivity of the CoMEA gel is 6.36 × 10−4 S m−1. In comparison, organogels can be produced through the mixing of monoethanolamine and oxalic acid in DMF under ambient conditions.122 The gel showed an interconnected bean seed-like morphology of ca. 1–2 μm (the size of the bean seeds). The nonlinear curvature was revealed by the I–V plot of the MS junction-based gel thin film device with a rectification ratio of ∼59. MgTAEA MOG was produced by the direct mixing of Mg2+ and tris(2-aminoethyl)amine in water.123 The hydrogel showed a flower-like structure composed of vertically growing slices of ca. 20–22 nm thickness. Due to the presence of –OH groups in the MgTAEA xerogel, water can be adsorbed by hydrogen bonding. The material has effective adsorption of iodine of 513 mg g−1, which is attributed to the interaction between iodine and –OH/Mg2+. MgTAEA showed switching behavior with Ion/Ioff = 62 and a broad semiconducting bandgap of 3.6 eV, indicating the potential for making memory devices.

1D metal–organic polymer systems possessing a conjugated organic ligand may show electronic conduction. Vallejo-Sánchez et al. reported a series of MOGs based on 1D coordination polymer nanofibers of [M(DTA)]n (MII: Ni, Cu, Pd; DTA: dithiooxamidato).124 The gels were achieved with metal acetates in DMF, DMA, or DMSO. The gels show unusual chemical resistance towards acids, alkalis, and mild oxidation/reduction chemicals resulting from the strength of the metal–S bond. Ultralight MOAs with a low density of 0.03 g cm−3 can be obtained by supercritical drying (Fig. 11). SEM images of MDTA MOAs consist of fibers of 3–8 nm in diameter and 30–800 nm in length. MDTA MOAs have semiconducting behavior with conductivities of 10−12 to 10−7 S cm−1 at 298 K. CuDTA and NiCuDTA are more conductive than other materials. The conductivity of MOAs increased to 10−5 S cm−1 with I2 doping. Additionally, the conductivity reversibly increased to 10−5 S cm−1 by adding acetic acid.

The conductivities of metal-carboxylate MOGs have been investigated. Saha et al. prepared Fe-1,2,4-BTC MOG by mixing 1,2,4-benzenetricarboxylic acid and Fe3+ in DMF.125 FESEM showed that the fresh gel has a fiber network structure, 20–25 nm in diameter, but SEM and TEM showed that the xerogel consists of deformed nanoparticles. The nonlinear curvature was revealed by the I–V plot of the MS junction-based gel thin film device with a rectification ratio of 42.19 at ±1 V. The conductivity of the device in the linear region was about 4.53 × 10−6 S m−1. This shows that the Fe-1,2,4-BTC xerogel can be used for SBD manufacturing. Furthermore, the conductivity was 4.58 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 95% relative humidity and 75 °C. Zr-carboxylate MOGs have been shown to have improved conductivity. The UiO-66 gel of H2BDC and ZrOCl2·8H2O was reported by Somjit et al.126 The gel consists of UiO-66 MOF nanoparticles with a size < 100 nm. UiO-66 thin films with 40–150 nm thickness were fabricated from the UiO-66 gel by spin-coating. The electrical conductivity (10−5 S cm−1) and interfacial charge diffusion coefficient of the nanoscale films (<100 nm) increased significantly as compared to its insulating bulk phase (10−7 S cm−1). ZnBDC MOG was synthesized by mixing Zn2+ and H2BDC in DMF, followed by sonication.127 SEM and TEM showed that ZnBDC has an interconnected porous network structure. The charge transport characteristics and photosensitivity are displayed in the I–V plot of the MS junction-based gel thin film device. The electrical conductivity was 7.77 × 10−6 and 17.66 × 10−6 S m−1 under dark and light conditions, respectively. The rectification rate at ±2 V was 37.06 under dark conditions, while it was 79.63 under light irradiation. CoBDC MOG was synthesized from Co2+ and H2BDC in DMF.128 STEM investigations illustrated agglomerated association in the hierarchal gel network. The gel shows charge transportation in the semiconducting region. The conductivity of CoBDC MOG was 4.75 × 10−6 S m−1, the carrier mobility was 1.38 × 10−7 m2 V−1 s−1, and the transit time was 4.21 × 10−6 s. The I–V plot shows that the MS junction device of gel thin film has a nonlinear curvature. The gel can be used for MS junction-based Schottky diode.
Semiconducting gels have been developed based on tartaric acid, and diacylhydrazone-based dicarboxylic acid derivatives. CuA-Tar MOG was synthesized by mixing Cu2+ and L-(+)tartaric acid, followed by sonication.129 The gel has a stone-like morphology. The calculated band gap energy of CuA-Tar gel was 2.18 eV indicating its semiconducting property. Cu-SL MOG was synthesized from Cu2+ and the successive acid derivative H2SL.130 The Cu-SL gel consists of interconnected linear nanofibers of about 1 μm in size. The Cu-SL gel has semiconducting characteristics with an optical band gap of 3.06 eV. From the I–V characteristic diagram, the gel-based SBD devices have nonlinear rectification characteristics. The rectification ratio (Ion/Ioff) of SBD was 11.35 for CuA-Tar and 70 for Cu-SL at ± 2 V.
MOGs are usually doped with conducting materials into the gel matrix of MOGs to enhance the electron transfer capability of the composite systems. MOGs can be combined with conductive materials such as graphene, graphene oxide (GO), other carbon substrates, and conductive polymers (e.g., polypyrrole, polythiophene, polyaniline).131,132 A series of 2D nanosheets of GO, layered transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), and hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) were incorporated as external dopants by Majumdar et al.133 The Cd-N2H4 hydrogel was prepared by mixing aqueous solutions of Cd2+ and N2H4·H2O at room temperature. Cd-N2H4 MOG consists of nanoparticles of about 8 nm in size. The Cd-N2H4 hydrogel can be wrapped by 2D nanosheets of GO and layered TMDs (MoS2, MoSe2, and WS2). For GO-Cd-N2H4 MOG, the nanoparticle size was about 6.5 nm. The Cd-N2H4 gel can construct a photosensitive MS junction-based Schottky diode (SD). The semiconducting properties of 2D nanosheet-dispersed Cd(II)-hydrogels (GO-Cd-N2H4, MoS2-Cd-N2H4, MoSe2-Cd-N2H4, and WS2-Cd-N2H4) were altered depending on the 2D dispersed nanosheets of GO and layered TMDs (Fig. 12). For the gel-based devices of Cd-N2H4, GO-Cd-N2H4, and WS2-Cd-N2H4, the conductivity increased by almost 2 times under illumination conditions as compared to dark and non-irradiated conditions. In contrast, for the gels of MoS2-Cd-N2H4 and MoSe2-Cd-N2H4, the conductivity increase was ca. 9 and 5 times, respectively. This indicated that MoS2-Cd-N2H4 and MoSe2-Cd-N2H4 are more sensitive upon illumination. A self-healable Cd-CADS MOG was developed from croconic acid disodium salt (CADS) and Cd(OAc)2·2H2O.134 Dispersion of 2D nanosheets of h-BN led to h-BN@Cd-CADS. Cd-CADS gel showed an interconnected rod-like fibrous morphology, while h-BN@Cd-CADS presented an interconnected hexagonal-type rod-shaped structure. The conductivities of Cd-CADS and h-BN@Cd-CADS-based devices were 1.57 × 10−4 S m−1 and 8.81 × 10−4 S m−1, respectively, with a space charge limited conduction mechanism (Fig. 12). The h-BN@Cd-CADS device showed better performance than the Cd-CADS gel-based device.

Conductive polymers have been incorporated inside MOGs. Dhara and Ballav reported the in situ incorporation of polypyrrole (PPy) and polythiophene (PTh) π-conjugated conducting moieties in FeBTC gel.135 Polypyrrole and polythiophene are formed in situ because of the oxidative polymerization induced by Fe3+ ions. The dc conductivities of the FeBTC-PPy and FeBTC-PTh composites were about 1.5 × 10−3 and 5.0 × 10−4 S cm−1, respectively. The superior conductivity of FeBTC-PPy could result from the efficient doping of PPy via electronic interactions between pyrrole N atoms and Fe3+ ions in the gel.
3.4. Mixed ionic-electronic conductive gels
MOGs have been shown to act as mixed ionic–electronic conductors. Kumar et al. reported a conductive MOG via the in situ LiOH deprotonation of mandelic acid-derived ligand H2IML, followed by Zn2+ coordination (Fig. 13).136 The hydrogel nanograins of about 20 nm in diameter aggregated to form an interlinked network of nanofibers. According to the EIS measurements, the resistance of the hydrogel was 122 Ω. The gel can be used as a mixed ionic-electronic conductor, and the ionic and electronic conductivities are 3.06 × 10−2 S cm−1 and 0.38 × 10−6 S cm−1, respectively. The transport number (tLi+) is 0.13, obtained by the DC polarization technique. Kumar et al. reported a conductive MOG by mixing Cd(OAc)2 and H4STL deprotonated by LiOH.137 H4STL was synthesized by imine condensation between 5-aminosalicylic acid and terephthaldehyde. The Cd-STL gel has an interconnected nanofiber network structure. The ionic conductivity obtained by the EIS test was 1.61 × 10−3 S cm−1, and the electronic conductivity was 3.57 × 10−6 S cm−1. The gel has a band gap of 2.85 eV, and the I–V characteristic curve shows that the range of non-linear behavior is −6 to 6 V, which is typical of Schottky diodes.

Skovroinski et al. reported the gels of polyphosphates and metal ions (Al3+, Fe3+, Zn2+, and Ca2+).138 Al/Fe-polyphosphate (AFPP) gels and Al/Fe-polyphosphate/polyaniline (AFPP/PAni) hybrid gels show self-healing and molding capabilities under relative humidity (RH) ranging from 40 to 80%. As the RH increased from a 34.2% RH environment, the gel swelled, and the surface became smooth. Smaller particles merged with larger particles. The larger particles maintained their shape when the RH reached 92.7%. When the RH decreased to 24.5%, the particle edges became sharper, while the surface remained smooth. CV experiments showed that the incorporation of polyaniline improved the electronic conductivity of the polyphosphate gel. Impedance spectroscopy showed that the ionic and electronic conductivities were 1.3–1.7 × 10−2 S cm−1 and 5.2 × 10−4 S cm−1, respectively. The “free” and “bound” water and the dynamic Al3+-phosphate interactions in the hydrogel network contributed to the conductivity.
4. Metal–organic gels for electrocatalysis
Developing economic, environmental, and renewable energy storage and conversion technologies is the solution to the sustainable development of modern society. Electrocatalysis is one of the imperative technologies for the effective conversion and production of green energy, such as water splitting technologies and electrocatalytic CO2 and O2 reduction. Electrochemical water splitting involving the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is considered an attractive way to sustainably produce green and renewable energy sources such as hydrogen energy. The electrochemical reduction of CO2 to CO or other value-added products is a necessary chemical reaction to improve the greenhouse effect and efficient, clean energy production. So far, noble metal Pt is the most active HER and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) element, and noble metal oxides (IrO2 and RuO2) are the benchmark electrocatalysts for OER. Consequently, the development of non-precious metal catalysts and metal-doped porous carbon materials is necessary for these technologies to replace precious metal catalysts.139 Efficient, robust, and durable electrocatalysts require low overpotential, fast kinetics, small charge transfer resistance (Rct), large electrochemical surface area (ECSA), and long-time stability.
Electrocatalysis is the process of accelerating electrochemical reactions occurring on the surface of the electrode material. Materials with abundant electrocatalytic sites, high surface area, high conductivity, and strong chemical and thermal stability are promising in electrocatalytic applications. MOGs are interesting electrocatalytic porous materials because of their high porosity, the combination of adjustable electroactive sites, and highly functional and decoratively porous and adjustable structures. The metal ions of MOGs can provide electroactive centers and the organic ligands can adjust the activity. The high surface area and hierarchically porous structure of MOGs can maximize the exposure of active sites. Coupling electroactive sites with hierarchically porous structures causes synergistic effects to improve the utilization ratio of catalytic active sites. This enhances the contact with substrates and shortens diffusion paths, thus promoting catalytic performance. In addition, catalytically active centers can be readily anchored to the network via functional groups or binding sites. MOGs have received attention as electrocatalysts in key electrochemical reactions such as the OER, electrooxidation, and the ORR due to their chemical diversity, and ease of preparation (Table 1). MOGs are promising materials for electrocatalytic water-splitting applications due to the controllable composition and flexible incorporation of metal catalysts. MOG-based electrocatalysts have available catalytic sites for efficient catalytic processes. The organic groups or metal ions in MOGs can be directly used as active sites to catalyze the reactions. Metal–organic hydrogels have significant water-holding capacity. MOGs that contain water solvent molecules can provide aqueous electrolyte accessibility, and favorable components can be introduced into the liquid to enable the tunability of their electrocatalytic activity. The rich mesopores and macropores of MOGs are efficient for the diffusion of gas, electrolytes and substances. MOGs have also been employed as precursors to obtain carbon materials140 and derived electrocatalysts via pyrolysis to improve their stability and conductivity.

4.1. Pristine metal–organic gels for electrocatalysis
Multimetallic electrocatalysts have attracted considerable attention. MOGs allow for the introduction of multimetallic ions in a one-pot method. The synergistic effects of different metal ions can strengthen electrocatalytic activities. Xiao et al. assembled multimetallic MOG electrocatalysts (MG-FeNiCo) from H3BTC and Fe3+, Co2+, and Ni2+ transition metal ions via metal–organic gelation (Fig. 14).141 The bimetallic and multimetallic MOGs are self-sorting. The multimetallic MOGs have mixed nanoparticles and tapes. The materials are composed of an amorphous phase and a crystalline nanoscale MOF phase. The MG-FeNiCo aerogel with a low density of 52.8 mg cm−3 can sustain ca. 770 times its weight. MG-FeNiCo showed OER activity with the overpotential of 248 mV and 272 mV at 20 mA cm−2 and 50 mA cm−2, respectively, and the Tafel slope was 49 mV dec−1. MG-FeNiCo showed excellent stability for the OER as well. The activity is attributed to the synergistic effect of metal ions and abundant active sites. In addition, there are electron motions in the oxidation/reduction state transitions of Fe3+/Fe2+ and Ni3+/Ni2+.

Heterometallic MOGs (Pd–Co, Pd–Ni, and Pd–Mn, etc.) were developed by Xiao et al. from pyridine-3,5-dicarboxylic acid, Pd2+, and transition metal ions.142 The Pd-M xerogels have nanofiber morphology. The Pd–Co(NO3−) xerogel showed a crosslinked nanofiber network (Fig. 14). Pd–Ni(Cl−), Pd–Mn(Cl−), and homometallic Pd xerogels also have nanofibrous structures. The bimetallic nanofibers of Pd–Co, Pd–Ni, and Pd–Mn are 100–150 nm in diameter, while those of Pd nanofibers are ca. 150 nm in diameter. The Pd–Co nanofibers/nickel foam showed electrocatalytic activity for the HER in an acidic electrolyte with an overpotential of 96 mV (vs. RHE) at 10 mA cm−2 and a Tafel slope of 63 mV dec−1. After electrochemical reduction activation, Pd nanoparticles (ca. 5 nm) were uniformly distributed in the fibrous network (EA Pd–Co@Pd NPs). Homometallic Pd also gave similar Pd nanoparticles (EA Pd@Pd NPs), but the structure was characterized by the destruction and reunion of the fibrous network. EA Pd–Co@Pd NPs-NF showed better HER activity (57 mV at 10 mA cm−2), and its Tafel slope (55 mV dec−1) is smaller as compared to Pd–Co (63 mV dec−1). This suggests that electrochemical activation leads to faster HER kinetics. Additionally, the material with low Pd content can maintain long-term stability for over 80 h.
Non-precious metal-based MOGs have been applied in OER electrocatalysis. In these gels, the metal ions or mixed metal ions are active centers and the porous gel network allows for easy accessibility to the catalytic active centers. Dhara et al. reported FeTCA and AlTCA gels assembled from Fe3+/Al3+ and 4,4′,4′′-tricarboxyltriphenylamine (TCA).143 AlTCA has a spindle-like morphology, while different nanofiber morphologies are shown in the FESEM and AFM images of FeTCA. LSV diagrams show the onset potential of AlTCA and FeTCA is 1.58 V and 1.65 V, respectively (Fig. 14). FeTCA has a lower overpotential of 458 mV at 10 mA cm−2 as compared to AlTCA. FeTCA has a smaller Tafel slope (∼87 mV dec−1), indicating higher kinetics for the OER. FeTCA shows good stability, and LSVs taken before and after 500 cycles showed that the overpotential increased by only 11% at 10 mA cm−2. Wang et al. developed a series of NixFe-gels using propylene oxide as an organic ligand, and Fe3+ and Ni2+ as metal ions by solvent-dispersion-triggered gelation (Fig. 15).144 Propylene oxide was dispersed in the Fe3+/Ni2+ ethanol/water solution to form a light brown NiFe-gel after ca. 8 h. The Ni2.0Fe-gel has a surface area of 216.9 m2 g−1. The porous structure of the Ni2.0Fe-gel facilitates the charge transfer process and enables easy diffusion of the reactants from the bulk solution to the surface of the Ni2.0Fe-gel. The synergistic effect of Fe3+/Ni2+ metal ions resulted in improved activity. Ni2.0Fe-gel is an efficient electrocatalyst for the OER with a low overpotential of 245 mV at 10 mA cm−2 in alkaline electrolytes.

Heterometallic superplastic NiMn-aerogels have been developed by Sun et al.145 First, Ni2+ and Mn2+ reacted with 2-thiophenecarboxylic acid in ethanol under hydrothermal conditions at 150 °C. After drying, the NiMn-aerogel displayed solid yellow-gray cylinders with a density of 3.6 mg cm−3. The aerogel was made of ordered 2D sheets with an adjacent spacing of ca. 15 μm, which consisted of 1D nanobelts 400 nm wide and tens of microns long. The NiMn-aerogel has been applied for HER electrolysis with no deformation. About 243 mV of overpotential is required by the NiMn electrode to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm−2 in natural seawater.
PA-M MOGs synthesized from phytic acid and metal ions show various morphologies and promising properties, including high proton conductivity and self-foaming.146 The gels can be partially reduced to significantly improve their electrocatalytic activity. Feng et al. reported bimetallic PA-FeCo MOGs of PA and mixed Fe3+/Co2+ metal ions to investigate their electrocatalytic OER activity.147 The bimetallic PA-FeCo-1:2:2 aerogel has a crosslinked network structure composed of irregular nanoparticles of ca. 35 nm in diameter. When partially reduced with NaBH4, the nanoparticles became smaller (15 nm) (Fig. 15). Upon NaBH4 reduction, PA-FeCo-1:2:2-NB showed mixed valence states of Fe(II)/Fe(III) and Co(III)/Co(II), which resulted in improved electrocatalytic OER activity with an overpotential of 257 mV at 20 mA cm−2, and a Tafel slope of 36 mV dec−1. PAFeCo-1:2:2-NB showed good stability at 10 mA cm−2 for 72 h. The partially reduced gels performed better than the corresponding carbonized material, probably because the particles agglomerated and the particle size increased upon carbonization.
A range of non-precious MOGs was developed by Zhang et al. through the reaction of 4,4′,4′′-s-triazine-1,3,5-triyltri-p-aminobenzoic acid (H3TATAB) with the N-rich triazine ring and various metal salts (NiCl2·6H2O, FeCl3·6H2O, CoCl2·6H2O, CuCl2·2H2O, ZnCl2, MnCl2·4H2O, etc.).148 Ni-MOG, Fe-MOG, and Ni0.6Fe0.4-MOG have 3D crosslinked nanofiber network morphologies. FeTATAB MOG displayed disorderly root-like nanofibers, and ZnTATAB MOG displayed a flaky granular structure. After sonication, Ni0.6Fe0.4-MOG showed a net-like structure of nanofibers with enhanced conductivity. The nanofiber network may optimize the charge transfer to achieve high conductivity. Due to the nanofiber network and the synergistic effect of Ni2+ and Fe3+ metal ions, Ni0.6Fe0.4-MOG showed a notable OER catalytic activity of 285 mV at 10 mA cm−2 using GC electrodes (and 173 mV at 10 mA cm−2 using nickel foam electrodes). Ni0.6Fe0.4-MOG also showed HER catalytic activity of 159 mV at 10 mA cm−2. When using Ni0.6Fe0.4-MOG as the electrode for the overall water splitting, the alkaline electrolyzer gave a low cell voltage of 1.61 V at 10 mA cm−2 and maintained a 90% current density in a 20 hour stability test. The metal-TATAB xerogels also achieved ORR and OER activity.149 The bimetallic FeCo-TATAB MOGs achieved excellent activity, benefiting from N-rich triazine rings and the synergetic effect of metal ions. The oxygen-containing groups (e.g., –COO−) are active sites for the 2e− ORR with high selectivity for H2O2. After the introduction of the hexacarboxylic ligand, the activity and selectivity of Fe0.1Co0.9-MOG increased with an onset potential of 0.76 V and 93% H2O2 selectivity at 0.15–0.6 V.
Metalloporphyrin imine gels provide chemical diversity and are easily modified via porphyrin metal centers. A range of (metallo)porphyrin imine gels was assembled via imine condensation from di/multifunctional aldehydes (ferrocene-1,1′-dicarbaldehyde, NA, and 1,3,5-tris-(4-formyl-phenyl)triazine, TFPT) and porphyrin derivatives (MTAPP, M = H2, Pd, Ni, Co, Zn, SnCl2).150,151 SEM and TEM investigations showed that the imine gels based on ferrocene and porphyrin have porous networked structures composed of interconnected nanoparticles, e.g., ca. 20–50 nm in diameter for CoTAPP-NA. Ferrocene exhibited redox properties and stability,152 so CoTAPP-NA showed HER activity in alkaline media with a low overpotential of 470 mV and a Tafel slope of 110 mV dec−1 at 10 mA cm−2. CoTAPP-NA also showed OER activity with an overpotential of 416 mV at 10 mA cm−2, making total water hydrolysis possible in an alkaline media. Moreover, CoTAPP-NA was active in oxygen reduction with an onset potential of 0.95 V and a half-wave potential of 0.84 V in an alkaline media.
UiO-67 MOG was deposited on the photonic crystal matrix for the HER.153 UiO-67 MOG was synthesized from 4,4-biphenyldicarboxylic acid and ZrOCl2·8H2O. SEM shows that the gel is composed of nanoparticles of about 50 nm in diameter. UiO-67 nanoparticles were fixed on butterfly wings to obtain the UiO-67/B active catalyst. The composite UiO-67/B showed electrochemical HER activity. The Tafel slope was 220 mV dec−1, and the onset potential was about 449 mV, which is lower than that of pristine UiO-67 (Tafel slope, 228 mV dec−1; onset potential, 586 mV). The light response of UiO-67/B showed that the current density increased from 28 mA cm−2 to 36 mA cm−2 at −0.6 V after light exposure for 30 min.
MOGs have been used for CO2 reduction and conversion. MOGs provide catalytic active centers in the 3D porous network and facilitate CO2 transport by functionalizing the gel network. The large surface areas of MOGs can enhance the contact between active centers and CO2. Albo et al. evaluated two Cu-based MOAs for gas diffusion electrodes (GDEs).154 The CuDTA MOA, [Cu(μ-C2H2N2S2)]n, was built from bisbidentate dithiooxamidate (DTA) and Cu2+ (Fig. 16). The CuZnDTA MOA, [Cu0.6Zn0.4(μ-C2H2N2S2)]n, was built from DTA and mixed Cu2+ and Zn2+. SEM images revealed that a uniform film covered the sprayed surface of GDE. For CuDTA and CuZnDTA GDEs, SEM images showed filamentous structures composed of crosslinked nanofibers of 5–20 nm in diameter. The electrodes had high surface areas, exposed Cu catalytic centers, accessibility and electrocatalytic activity for CO2 reduction. The GDEs demonstrated high efficiency in the production of MeOH/EtOH in the liquid phase. The maximum cumulative faradaic efficiency for CO2 conversion was 6% and 9.9% at CuDTA- and CuZnDTA-based electrodes, respectively, at 10 mA cm−2, 3 mL min cm−2 electrolyte-flow/area ratio, and 20 mL min cm−2 gas-flow/area ratio. The electrocatalytic performance remained stable for 12 h for CuZnDTA-based electrodes.

An iron porphyrin-based graphene hydrogel has been developed by Choi et al. for CO2 reduction.188 The porphyrin/graphene hydrogel FePGF was assembled from cationic iron porphyrin FeTMAP and reduced liquid crystalline graphene oxide (rLCGO) (Fig. 16). The hydrogel was freeze-dried to obtain a light black porous aerogel. FESEM investigation showed that freeze-dried FePGH has an interconnected porous structure, and TEM revealed that FePGH has flat sheets. FeTMAP is positively charged and can help maintain flat and large GO sheets via electrostatic interactions with the negatively charged carboxylate groups of LCGO. FePGH showed electrocatalytic activity and converted CO2 to CO with a high faradaic efficiency of 96.2% at an overpotential of 280 mV. For FePGH, FeTMAP acted as the catalytic active center and CO2 gas diffusion was facilitated by the 3D GO-based gel network. FePGH exhibited long-term durability at −0.39 V after 20 h with a stable current density of 0.42 mA cm−2, CO faradaic efficiency of 96.4%, and cathodic energy efficiency of 79.7%.
MOGs have been used as electrocatalysts for methanol oxidation reactions (MOR). Wang et al. developed AlNi-MOG and AlNiCu-based trimetallic MOGs based on AlBDC MOG.156 AlNiCu-MOG is an efficient MOR electrocatalyst with MOR catalytic activity of 17.1 mA cm−2, while Al-MOG has no MOR activity. The addition of acetylene black improved the electrical conductivity of AlNiCu-MOG. The MOR activity of the composite material was dramatically enhanced with a peak current density of 33.24 mA cm−2.
4.2. Pyrolyzed metal–organic gels for electrocatalysis
MOGs have been employed as thermolysis templates or as a carbonaceous matrix to produce carbon materials and metal oxides for electrocatalysis. After thermal treatment, MOG-derived materials showed improved stability under high temperatures and harsh chemical conditions, and a higher proportion of electroactive sites were exposed in the hierarchical porous network with reduced interfacial resistance. Guo et al. reported that bimetallic MOGs (BMOGs) were assembled from guanosine monophosphate (GMP) and Zn2+/Mn+ (Co2+, Fe3+, Ni2+).157 The BMOGs were carbonized into conductive carbon, and phosphorus was doped in the resulting carbon structure. The BMOGs and nitrogen/phosphorus chelate ligands were used to obtain heterostructures of transition metal phosphide@nitrogen/phosphorus-doped carbon quasi-aerogels (TMP@NPCA). Due to the strong interactions between Zn2+/Co2+ and GMP, TMP@NPCA maintains the 3D interconnected network structure of BMOGs after pyrolysis. TMP@NPCA has a conductive quasi-aerogel network of heteroelement-doped carbon heterostructures, while metal ions Mn+ produce uniform TMP nanoparticles (e.g., CoP). The electronegative dopants can accelerate charge transfer. The exposed TMP nanoparticles are electrochemically active, and they are dispersed in graphitic shells; therefore, TMP@NPCA exhibited excellent ORR/HER bifunctional activity. CoP@NPCA exhibited ORR activity in alkaline media with a half-wave potential of 0.85 V (vs. RHE). It showed long-term durability with 96.7% retention after 50000 s. Moreover, CoP@NPCA exhibited HER activity in electrolytes over a wide pH range. The overpotential at 10 mA cm−2 was 230 mV in 0.5 mol L−1 H2SO4, 290 mV in 1 mol L−1 KOH, and 352 mV in 1 mol L−1 PBS. Wang et al. synthesized Al-FeTCPP MOG using AlCl3·6H2O and iron tetrakis(4-carboxyphenyl porphyrin) (FeTCPP).158 After supercritical drying, the Al-FeTCPP aerogel showed a wormhole-like porous structure with aggregated nanoparticles of ca. 120 nm in size. The Al-FeTCPP aerogel was pyrolyzed at 1000 °C to obtain the Fe–N–C aerogel. The Fe–N–C aerogel has a hierarchically porous structure consisting of nanosheets. The ORR performance of the Fe–N–C aerogel is superior because of the Fe–N catalytic sites and the presence of graphitized carbon, as well as the mass transport promoted by the porous structure. For the Fe–N–C aerogel, the onset potential was 0.96 V, the half-wave potential was 0.79 V, and the limiting current density was 5.02 mA cm−2 under alkaline conditions. Moreover, the Fe–N–C aerogel had a slight Tafel slope of 91.23 mV dec−1 and long-term stability of 3000 CV scanning cycles.
The unique structure of MOGs can be utilized to lead to doping function and controllable morphology. The dopants with favorable electronic structures facilitate the performance. Urea/carbon nanotube (CNT)-decorated FeBTC MOG was reported by Wang et al.159 The FeBTC urea/CNTs gels served as precursors to obtain Fe-Fe2O3@N-doped-C nanoparticles dispersed on N-doped CNTs after carbonization at 700 °C under an N2 atmosphere (Fig. 17). FeBTC/urea/CNTs-700 was derived from the gel precursor containing both urea and CNTs and displayed ca. 10 nm nanoparticles dispersed on the CNTs. FeBTC/urea/CNTs-700 has highly dispersed Fe-Fe2O3 sites, high content of doped N, and structural stability. It shows ORR catalytic activity with an onset potential of 0.92 V and a half-wave potential of 0.72 V. The material has good stability with 91.7% current retention after 20000 s.

During the pyrolysis process, the morphology of MOG precursors may become damaged or collapse. Cao et al. reported a series of MOGs by simply mixing the organic ligand 4,4′,4’’-[(1,3,5-triazine-2,4,6-triyl)tris(azanediyl)]tribenzoic acid (H3TATAB) and metal ions (Co2+, Fe3+, and Ni2+).160 The MOGs featured diverse metal ion compositions and tuneable ratios. The pyrolysis of the MOGs led to the formation of spinel-type metal oxides. SEM images of the MOGs consist of nanofibers; however, the derived metal oxides showed different morphologies depending on the composition. CoFeNi-O-1 (derived from the MOG with the molar ratio of Co:Fe:Ni = 5:1:4) has an interconnected network structure based on nanoparticles, while CoFe-O has a bulk-like morphology and Co–O has a coral-like structure. CoFeNi-O-1 is polycrystalline as indicated by the lattice fringes of 0.24 nm and 0.21 nm of the crystal planes (311) and (400) for Co1.71Ni1.29O4 and NiFe2O4, respectively. CoFeNi-O-1 affords remarkable electrocatalytic OER performance with a low overpotential of 244 mV at 10 mA cm−2 and a slight Tafel slope of 55.4 mV dec−1 (Fig. 17). Song et al. prepared the tube-like metal-carbon nanocomposite A-FeCrNi/C via the pyrolysis of the FeCr-doped NiBTC aerogel.161 The FeCr-doped NiBTC aerogel has a 3D spongy-like network of aggregated nanoparticles, while A-FeCrNi/C consists of tangled and branched carbon tubes with highly dispersed encapsulated nanoparticles (10 nm). More active sites were exposed for the morphology, and diffusion paths were shortened for electrocatalysis so that A-FeCrNi/C achieved good OER activity with 10 mA cm−2 current density and only 220 mV overpotential, lower than commercial RuO2 (280 mV) (Fig. 17). A-FeCrNi/C showed a lower Tafel slope (48.8 mV dec−1) than RuO2 (135.2 mV dec−1). A-FeCrNi/C showed electrocatalytic HER activity with 137 mV overpotential at 10 mA cm−2. The Tafel slope was 130.7 mV dec−1. When using A-FeCrNi/C-loaded carbon paper as both the cathode and anode for whole water splitting, a 10 mA cm−2 current density was achieved at a cell voltage of 1.54 V, which could be operated stably for more than 50 h.
Shijina et al. presented an interpenetrating network (IPN) of FeBTC MOG (soft segment) assembled from FeCl3 and H3BTC and in situ polymerized melamine formaldehyde (MF) (hard segment).162 In the synthesis of FeBTC-MFN, naphthalene (a sublimable porogen) was introduced into the MF pre-polymer matrix, and it was then added to the FeBTC MOG. Fe–N-doped graphitic carbons were fabricated with the pyrolysis of FeBTC-MF and FeBTC-MFN at 900 °C under an N2 atmosphere. FeBTC-MF-C and FeBTC-MFN-C indicate morphological diversity, depending on the naphthalene content. FeBTC-MFN-C has a sheet-like graphitized carbon structure with distributed elongated pores, while FeBTC-MF-C shows only a few pores despite the evenly distributed macropores. Both FeBTC-MF-C and FeBTC-MFN-C exhibited good ORR activity with an onset potential of 0.91 V (vs. 1 V of Pt/C). The high limiting current of FeBTC-MFN-C is attributed to the increased surface area and graphite–nitrogen content. FeBTC-MFN-C had a half-wave potential drop of 31 mV after 5000 cycles, which is lower than Pt/C (34 mV). FeBTC-MFN-C had a lower Tafel slope of 83.4 mV dec−1 than FeBTC-MF-C, indicating faster ORR kinetics.
He et al. developed Fc-F/GO hybrid hydrogels containing ferrocenoyl phenylalanine (Fc-F) and graphene oxide (GO).163 Ferrocene and phenlyalanine were used as Fe and N precursors, respectively. The Fc-F hydrogel was used to prevent the stacking of graphene nanosheets. The Fc-F fibrils were anchored on GO sheets. During the hydrothermal reaction, ferrocene moieties in the fibrils were oxidized by GO to form Fe3O4 nanocrystals. The Fe3O4 nanocrystals were retained on the GO sheets, thus inhibiting the aggregation of graphene sheets. Hybrid aerogels with Fe3O4 nanocrystals/nitrogen-doped graphene (Fe3O4/N-GAs) were fabricated through the freeze-drying and thermal processes of the Fc-F/GO hydrogels, and Fe3O4 nanocrystals were uniformly distributed on the 3D network of ultra-thin graphene sheets. The Fe3O4/N-GAs showed outstanding ORR electrocatalytic performance. During oxygen reduction, the reaction electron number was 3.95, and the H2O yield on Fe3O4/N-GsAs was 95.7%, suggesting a four-electron transfer pathway with low H2O2 yield.
The Co2+-based MOG of 3,5-diamino triazole (DAT) and Co(OAc)2·4H2O was reported by Saha et al.164 SEM and TEM images indicated that the gel has a wrinkled sheet-like structure. Upon calcination of the xerogel in air Co3O4 was obtained with a sea-urchin-like structure and a large surface area. The xerogel and Co3O4 were used as the electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution in acidic and alkaline media. Co3O4 has a superior electrocatalytic activity for the OER in an acidic medium, while the xerogel is better with 91.72% FE under alkaline conditions. In the xerogel, both the Co2+ and Co3+ oxidized states were stabilized by the ligand DAT, which assisted the Co–OOH formation under alkaline conditions. Pyrolysis of the nitrogen-rich CoDAT gel under an N2 atmosphere yielded cobalt nanomaterials encapsulated in N,O-doped carbon onions, EK-a (500 °C) and EK-b (800 °C) (Fig. 17).165 EK-c is produced upon calcination in a 5% H2/Ar gas mixture at 800 °C, and the partial oxidation of EK-c in the air at 250 °C achieved (EK-d). SEM and HRTEM investigations showed that EK-a, EK-b, and EK-c have Co(0)-dispersed N,O-doped carbon with a carbon-coated spheroidal onion-shaped structure, and EK-d has Co@CoO@Co3O4-dispersed N,O-doped carbon with interlinked plate-like morphology. EK-b showed the best OER activity with a low overpotential of 378 mV at 10 mA cm−2, mass activity of 282.43 mA mg−1 cm−2, and high turnover frequency of 0.012 s−1.
ZIF-8 nanofiber aerogels are used as precursors for the preparation of porous carbon materials so that the aggregation of nanofibers can be effectively avoided with high-temperature calcination.166 The MOF nanofiber (∼190 nm) aerogel MOFN-40 was prepared by 2-methylimidazole, Zn(NO3)2·6H2O and Te nanowires (template). SEM and TEM images revealed that the calcined HPCN-40 retained the 1D morphology. SEM images exhibited well-dispersed nanofibers in HPCN-40. The bimetallic MOFN-40 nanofiber aerogel was converted to carbon nanofibers containing 3% Co, and TEM images indicated good dispersion with similar nanofibrous morphology. The derived porous carbons are promising electrocatalysts for cathode ORR. HPCN-40-3% Co showed good catalytic activity with a half-wave potential of about −0.133 V. The material has good stability with a slightly negative shift after 20000 continuous CV scans.
FeBTC-chitosan gel has been used as a precursor by Shijina et al. for synthesizing N,Fe-doped graphitic carbon.167 The solution of Fe3+ and chitosan reacts with H3BTC, leading to the gelation of CHI-TMA-Fe. For CHI-TMA-Fe-M1, chitosan is intercalated after the gelation of FeBTC MOG. Carbonization at 900 °C under an N2 atmosphere yields mesoporous carbons CHI-TMA-Fe-CW and CHI-TMA-Fe-CW-M1. SEM images indicate that CHI-TMA-Fe-CW has characteristic micron-sized pores. In the presence of chitosan, the CHI-TMA-Fe-CW-M1 structure is transformed into a well-distributed mesoporous structure. The materials show four-electron-dominant ORR activity in alkaline electrolytes. Chitosan-modified CHI-TMA-Fe-CW-M1 has a higher onset potential of 0.925 V than CHI-TMA-Fe-CW (0.782 V). CHI-TMA-Fe-CW and CHI-TMA-Fe-CW-M1 exhibit half-wave potentials of 0.61 V and 0.78 V, respectively. The catalyst demonstrates good durability in alkaline electrolytes with a slightly E1/2 negative shift of 24 mV after 5000 cycles and almost unchanged onset potential.
5. Metal–organic gels for batteries
Batteries are one of the most prominent electrical energy storage (EES) portable devices because of their high energy density. A battery typically consists of an electrolyte, two electrodes (cathode and anode), and a separator, where an electrochemical reaction occurs to release or store the energy. LIBs are used in most portable devices due to their advantages such as small volume, light weight, and high energy/power density. However, traditional LIBs consisting of a graphite anode and lithiated transition metal oxide cathode have reached their performance limit. In addition, lithium's resource scarcity and high cost of raw materials increasingly limit long-term applications. Therefore, great efforts have been made to develop new state-of-the-art batteries. The development of advanced batteries with high power and energy density and long-term cycle stability has benefited from novel electrode materials with controllable structure–activity relationships. Energy storage in batteries involves chemical reactions (e.g., redox reactions) between the intercalated ions of the electrolyte and the active surface of the electrode.168 MOGs have high porosity and rich redox sites. The electrochemical function of electrodes can be tuned via the chemical modification of electrodes with MOG materials with unique electronic and catalytic properties. The hierarchical porous network allows for the efficient conveying of ions. MOGs show potential as electrolytes or electrode materials for next-generation rechargeable batteries, although the low densities of MOGs can cause problems in practical applications because a low density normally results in low compaction density and low gravimetric energy density in energy storage (e.g., batteries and supercapacitors). MOGs have been used in metal-ion batteries (LIBs and sodium-ion batteries), lithium–sulfur batteries, and metal gas batteries (zinc–air batteries). MOGs have also been used as battery electrodes, i.e., cathodes and the active material of anodes.
5.1. Lithium-ion batteries
MOG materials are promising anode materials in the field of LIBs. Wu et al. fabricated self-healable MBTC MOGs (M = Ni, Zr, Fe, Al, Cr) membranes by a drop-casting technique.169 MBTC MOGs have an amorphous gelatinous structure. The MOG structure benefits the insertion and removal of Li+ ions, and the topological defects increase the storage sites for Li+ ions. SEM images show that the membranes are evenly distributed on the surface of Cu foil with 1 μm thickness (Fig. 18). The membrane electrode has semiconductor properties with the conductivity of MOG membranes being 10−8 to 10−7 s m−1. Among the five LIB membrane anodes, NiBTC MOG had a specific capacity of 1710.1 mA h−1 when the current density was 100 mA g−1. The specific capacity was maintained at 1245.5 mA h−1 after 30 cycles with high-rate performance. Additionally, the coulombic efficiency was close to 100% after 100 cycles at the high current density of 2 A g−1 or 5 A g−1.

Polyoxometalate (POM)-based MOGs have the advantages of POMs and MOGs and have been used as anode materials of LIBs. Meng et al. incorporated [PMo12O40]3− (PMo12) into FeBTC MOG of FeCl3·6H2O and H3BTC.170 SEM images revealed that PMo12@FeBTC-2 has a continuous 3D network composed of interconnected spherical particles. PMo12@FeBTC-2 possesses good performance as an anode material of LIBs and it has a high reversible capacity of 658 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 after 50 cycles, a good rate capability of 269 mA h g−1 at 2.0 A g−1, and long lifetime of 400 cycles with ca. 423.5 mA h g−1 at 1.0 A g−1.
Taking advantage of the unique structure, carbonized MOGs have been developed as anode materials for LIBs. Ye et al. prepared MOG-derived FeSe2-C/rGO anode material for LIBs.171 Graphite oxide (GO) was added in FeBTC MOG (used as a template) (Fig. 19). GO/FeBTC-MOG was converted to FeSe2-C/rGO via two-stage temperature programmed calcination in a vacuum. Mesoporous rod-like FeSe2 is composed of nanoparticles coated with rGO thin sheets. The addition of rGO sheets improves the conductivity of the anode material while limiting the growth of FeSe2. The FeSe2-C/rGO anode displays excellent electrochemical capability as well as stable discharge/charge capacity in LIBs. For the FeSe2-C anode, the lithium storage capacity was 691.0 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at 100 mA g−1. When the current density was 100 mA g−1, the discharge capacity of the FeSe2-C/rGO battery was maintained at 917.7 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles. Yang et al. used electrospinning to develop nanofiber membranes composed of uniform FeBTC MOGs in a polyacrylonitrile (PAN) solution (Fig. 19).172 The nanofibers of MOG precursors were used to prepare FexOy/nitrogen-doped carbon composites (FexOy/NC-MOG) via high-temperature carbonization. SEM images showed that size of pristine MOG/PAN fibers to be 300–400 nm in diameter. After the composite was carbonized in H2/Ar and air atmosphere, the fibrous morphology of pristine MOG/PAN was maintained, while the carbonized fibers shrank. When FexOy/NC-MOG was used as the anode in LIBs, it exhibited an excellent rate performance of 449.8 mA h g−1 at 5000 mA g−1 and long cycle life of 629.3 mA h g−1 after 500 cycles at 1000 mA g−1.

MOGs have been used to fabricate binder-free electrodes to accelerate the transportation and migration rate of Li+ ions in LIBs. Wu et al. developed multilevel-3D porous NiO nanowires coated by ZrBTC MOG.173 NiO nanowires were generated by annealing NiBTC MOG in the presence of PMMA microspheres. The NiO nanowires have a periodic macroporous structure of ∼200 nm in diameter. The porous structure has more lithium storage sites and hosts for the insertion/extraction of Li+ ions. ZrBTC MOG was coated on the surface of NiO nanowires to serve as a binder. When used as binder-free anodes in LIBs, the self-supporting ZrBTC MOG-coated NiO nanowires showed excellent electrochemical performance with a specific capacity of 1816.3 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1 (Fig. 19). The specific capacity remained at 1318.7 mA h g−1 after 150 cycles.
5.2. Zinc–air battery
Metal–air batteries have high energy density because O2 can be drawn directly from the air. Zn–air batteries (ZABs) have the advantages of low cost, high energy density, good stability, and electrochemical reversibility.91 Liu et al. reported a range of MOGs obtained by the coordination of terpyridyl ligands (1,3,5-tris(4-(2,2′:6′,2′′-terpyridyl)phenyl)-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene or hexa(4-(2,2′:6′,2′′-terpyridyl)phenyl)-benzene) with CoCl2 (to get Co-Mac-1 and Co-Mac-4) or Co(OAc)2 (to get Co-Mac-2 and Co-Mac-3) (Fig. 20).174 Co-Mac-1 has an interconnected 3D porous network of stacked monolayers. Co-Mac-1 possesses better OER activity than commercial RuO2/C catalysts with a low overpotential of 320 mV at 10 mA cm−2 and high stability over 2000 cycles. Co-Mac-1 exhibited a Tafel slope of 54 mV dec−1 and charge-transfer resistance of 7 Ω; this indicates that the gel has fast charge-transport kinetics. Strong coordination interactions exist between two components to form 3N–Co (TpyCo2+) and 6N–Co (TpyCo2+Tpy). Coordinatively unsaturated 3N–Co configurations are active sites. When Co-Mac-1 is used as the air cathode in a rechargeable Zn–air battery, it shows high charging–discharging stability of more than 700 cycles. The same group further developed supramolecular hydrogels based on multi-terpyridyl Co2+ complexes where the gelation driving forces are hydrogen bonding and π–π interactions.175 The (Tpy)4Co4 MOG shows charge-transfer resistance of 12.6 Ω and oxygen evolution ability with a low overpotential of 264 mV at 10 mA cm−2 and 301 mV at 100 mA cm−2. Using (Tpy)4Co4 as an air cathode, the liquid rechargeable zinc–air battery has long-term cycling stability of over 1100 h at 2 mA cm−2 and high energy efficiency of 65.3%. In addition, the quasi-solid-state battery of (Tpy)4Co4 displays temperature adaptability from −40 °C to 25 °C.

Fe–N–C single-atom site catalysts (SASCs) have been fabricated by Wang et al. using Fe-agarose gel.176 The activated carbon (AC)-containing Fe-agarose gel was synthesized from agarose, FeCl3·6H2O, and AC, in which the Fe-agarose gel occupies the rich pores of AC. After carbonization, the gel-containing pores were reopened using ammonia gas to obtain Fe-SASC. Well-dispersed iron particles of 2–4 nm in size were included in the AC. Fe-SASC showed better ORR catalytic activity and stability than commercial Pt/C due to exposed Fe–N single-atom sites. Fe-SASC has a high limiting diffusion current, a positive onset potential of 1.00 V, a half-wave potential of 0.87 V, and methanol resistance. When evaluated as the air electrode material in ZABs, Fe-SASC demonstrated a higher open circuit voltage (1.51 V) and higher peak power density (153 mW cm−2) than 20% Pt/C.
Shang et al. reported the fabrication of Co2+-folic acid (FA) MOG assembled from folic acid and CoCl2·6H2O.177 Co nanoparticles enveloped by nitrogen-doped carbon nanosheets (CoNC-MOG-9) were obtained upon the carbonization of FA-Co MOG under an N2 atmosphere (Fig. 20). CoNC-MOG-9 has an interconnected porous network structure. Taking advantage of the unique structure, CoNC-MOG-9 exhibited ORR activity with a half-wave potential of 0.815 V. It also displayed OER activity with an overpotential of 0.40 V at 10 mA cm−2 and a Tafel slope of 76 mV dec−1. When integrated into all-solid-state ZABs, the CoNC-MOG-9 cathode provides a high open circuit potential of 1.413 V and a high power density of 63 mW cm−2 at 80 mA cm−2 with excellent stability and durability.
The MOG-derived material CoP@NPCA-900 mentioned above in Section 4.2 has been used as the cathode of ZABs.157 The discharge polarization and power density curves of ZABs exhibit a high current density of 126 mA cm−2 at 0.9 V. The ZABs with the CoP@NPCA-900 cathode showed a higher peak power density of 125 mW cm−2 at 0.66 V and higher voltage at the discharge current density of 10 mA cm−2 than the ZABs with the Pt/C cathode (Fig. 20). When the current density was 10 and 50 mA cm−2, the specific capacity was 668.3 and 631.5 mA h g−1, respectively. The corresponding high gravimetric energy density was 835.4 and 745.2 W h kg−1, respectively.
Metal-containing porous polymer gels have been used to prepare porous carbon catalysts doped by multiple elements via simple pyrolysis. Zhou et al. reported a series of aminal-linked (–NH–CH–NH–) gels via the polymerization of two aldehydes (ferrocene aldehyde (Fc-CHO) and benzaldehyde (Bn-CHO), or Fc-CHO and 4-(trifluoromethyl)benzaldehyde (TF-CHO)) with melamine (MA) via imine formation (Fig. 21).178 In addition to increased porosity and CO2 uptake capacity, a variety of dopants (N, F, and Fe) can be introduced into the porous skeletons. Additionally, the solvent DMSO was used directly as the sulfur source. SEM images revealed that the gels have spherical particles, and TEM images showed microporous to mesoporous porosity. The gels can be pyrolyzed to form hierarchically porous carbon with various dopants. SEM images of pyrolysed carbon composites TF-C-800, TF-C-900, and TF-C-1000 showed spherical aggregates with rough surfaces. TEM images of TF-C-900 revealed hierarchical microporous to macroporous structures. TF-C-900 showed an onset potential of 1.01 V and a half-wave potential of 0.88 V in an alkaline solution. Additionally, TF-C-900 has good stability and methanol tolerance. The charge–discharge voltage gap of homemade ZAB using TF-C-900 cathode was smaller than that of Pt/C-based ZAB, remaining almost unchanged after 100 cycles.

To prepare metal-containing polymer gels, Zhang et al. synthesized a hydrogel from chitosan and potassium hexacyanoferrate(III) (K3[Fe(CN)6]) upon sonication.179 The hydrogel was freeze-dried and annealed under an N2 atmosphere, and iron-based hollow hetero-nanoparticles (Fe/Fe3C/Fe2O3) were fixed on graphitic nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (Fe/Fe3C/Fe2O3@N-CNTs) (Fig. 21). SEM images revealed that Fe nanoparticles are located at the tip of carbon nanotubes, and TEM showed uniform hollow nanoparticles of ca. 25 nm in size on the carbon nanotubes. Fe/Fe3C/Fe2O3@N-CNTs have excellent ORR catalytic activity (E1/2 = 0.89 V), durability, and selectivity in alkaline medium. The specific capacity of rechargeable ZAB with Fe/Fe3C/Fe2O3@N-CNTs + RuO2 air cathode is 733 mA h gZn−1 at 5 mA cm−2, which exceeds that of the Pt/C + RuO2-based ZAB (631 mA h gZn−1 and 796 W h kgZn−1).
5.3. Lithium–sulfur batteries
Li–S batteries composed of a lithium metal anode and sulfur-based cathode are promising next-generation rechargeable batteries due to the high theoretical capacity and low cost of elemental sulfur.180 MOGs provide an avenue to explore efficient sulfur composites for high-performance Li–S batteries. MOG-derived carbons have been used as cathode sulfur host materials for Li–S batteries. The existence of pores helps confine soluble hydrophilic polysulfides. Xia et al. prepared heteroatom-doped carbon materials from AlBTC aerogels via two-step melt-diffusion.84 The discharge capacity of the MOA-C/S composite was 1240 mA h g−1 in the second cycle and 1155 mA h g−1 in the third cycle. The composites have higher capacity and better cycling behavior than composites prepared from xerogels with less porosity. Li et al. showed that AlBTC MOG could be used as a binder to encapsulate sulfur-calcined reduced graphene oxide (S-RGO) to prepare Al-MOG@S-RGO cathode material for Li–S batteries (Fig. 22).180 AlBTC has a rice granule morphology and is ca. 20 nm in size. The composite Al-MOG@S-RGO can effectively control the diffusion of polysulfides in the cathode because of the interaction between carboxylate groups and polysulfides. Al-MOG@S-RGO has good battery performance with a high initial discharge capacity of 1391 mA h g−1, and a high reversible capacity of 902 mA h g−1 after 200 cycles at 0.3C.

CuBTC MOGs have been studied by several research groups.182–184 Zhang et al. developed nitrogen-doped hierarchical 3D porous carbons (NHPC) from the CuBTC aerogel assembled from H3BTC, Cu2+, and hexamethylenetetramine (HMT).182 The porous structure of NHPC can be controlled by different amounts of HMT (Fig. 22). The rod-like NHPC was applied in a Li–S battery. The initial specific capacity was 1341 mA h g−1 at 0.5C, and 354 mA h g−1 at 5C. The attenuation over 500 cycles was 0.08% per cycle at 1C. The long-term cycle performance of the S/NHPC cathode benefits from its high N-doping, hierarchical porous structure, and ion transfer channels. Its structure confines soluble LiPS and a 1D rod-like integrated carbon network to provide channels for electrons.
5.4. Zinc–iodine batteries
Rechargeable aqueous Zn–I2 batteries couple a Zn anode and I2 cathode with a theoretical output voltage of 1.29 V. MOG-based electrolytes have been constructed to achieve quasi-solid Zn–I2 batteries. Machhi et al. reported that the FeBTC gel containing I2 active species was used for cathode materials.185 The hierarchically porous FeBTC MOG cathode encapsulated iodine in aqueous zinc–iodine batteries (AZIBs) (Fig. 23). In rechargeable AZIBs, zinc metal foil was used as the anode and iodine encapsulated in the FeBTC MOG matrix was used as the cathode. The discharge capacity was 184.9 mA h g−1 and capacity retention of 95.8% was obtained after 1500 cycles at 1C.

5.5. Zinc–MnO2 batteries
MOGs have been used as electrolytes in the fabrication of flexible Zn–MnO2 batteries. AMP-Mn MOG of adenosine 5′-monophosphate (AMP) and Mn2+ was reported by Hu et al.186 The AMP-Mn/PVA hybrid hydrogel is formed by combining the AMP-Mn hydrogel with poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) polymer networks. TEM images showed a 3D network structure of stacking nanofibers. Interestingly, when the newly formed hydrogel is destroyed mechanically by an external force and then allowed to stand for a few minutes, the sample can form a solid again. The AMP-Mn/PVA hydrogel was used as an electrolyte to manufacture the flexible Zn–MnO2 battery (Fig. 23). Cycling stability was measured for the battery under different bending conditions. After the 90° bent battery was used for 30 cycles in a flat state, its capacity was stable at 183 mA h g−1 in the subsequent 30 cycles. The other bent battery was also stable for 30 cycles with a reversible capacity of 182 mA h g−1. When the flexible battery changed from a bent state to a flat state after 90 cycles, its discharge–charge behavior remained stable.
6. Metal–organic gels for supercapacitors
Supercapacitors and batteries are the most studied electrochemical energy storage devices. Compared with batteries, supercapacitors are more attractive due to their high power density, fast charge and discharge rates, and long life. Generally, the construction of supercapacitors involves using highly conductive thermally and chemically stable but highly porous materials. Supercapacitor devices are divided into two categories, electrical double-layer capacitors (EDLCs) and pseudocapacitors, depending on their charge storage mechanism. EDLCs consist of an electrolyte, two electrodes, and a separator. EDLCs store energy by electrostatic charge accumulating at the interface between the electrolyte and the electrode surface. Porous materials with a high specific surface area are used as electrode materials to improve the performance of EDLCs.187 MOGs and MOG-derived materials are attractive for EDLC electrode materials. The high porosity and adjustable redox active sites in MOGs make the materials promising as active components of capacitor structures.
The self-healing property of MOGs contributes to the fabrication of flexible devices. Karan et al. reported a Zn2+-based MOG assembled from L-2-(3,5-di-tert-butyl-2-hydroxybenzylamino)-succinic acid (L9) and ZnSO4.94 Zn-MOG shows self-healing properties attributed to H-bonding and ionic interactions (Fig. 24). FESEM images show that Zn-MOG consists of an entangled network. Zn-MOG has been used as a gel electrolyte to fabricate flexible solid-state symmetric supercapacitor devices. The specific capacitance of the Zn-MOG-based device (47.26–17.28 F g−1 at a current density of 1–10 A g−1) is three times higher than that of the corresponding PVA-gel-based device. The Zn-MOG-based device showed a wide operating potential window (2.1 V) and low charge-transfer resistance. This suggests that self-healing Zn-MOG is beneficial to the charge transport of Na+ and SO42− ions, and has chemical and electrochemical stability. The device showed good cycling performance with a capacity retention of 67% after 1000 cycles.

MOG-derived carbons have hierarchically porous structures and high specific surface areas, which can shorten the ion diffusion path and improve efficiency.188 For example, Wang et al. synthesized porous carbon from AlBTC MOG.189 The AlBTC MOG was calcined at 600, 800, and 1000 °C to produce porous carbons, and the corresponding materials were PC600, PC800, and PC1000. After carbonization, the products were treated with an HCl solution for metal removal. TEM images suggest that all the carbons have a 3D sponge-like porous morphology. In another report, Mahmood et al. also prepared porous carbons using AlBTC MOG.190 After carbonization, the product was activated by NaOH for metal removal (Fig. 25). The surface area of porous carbons was up to 1757 m2 g−1. The porous carbons PC600, PC800, and PC1000 have been demonstrated as efficient electrode materials with the respective specific capacitances of 213.1, 129.1, and 114.3 F g−1.191 When used for capacitive deionization, PC800 showed a notable desalination capacity of 25.16 mg g−1 at 1.4 V in 500 mg L−1 aqueous NaCl solution. It showed that MOG-derived porous carbons are potential electrode materials for high-performance water desalination.

Various Fe3+-based MOGs have been used as precursors to fabricate supercapacitor materials. Mahmood et al. used FeBTC MOG to prepare nanoporous carbons (NPCs) via high-temperature carbonization (Fig. 25).190 After calcination, Fe3+ was converted into Fe3O4/Fe nanoparticles. The Fe3O4/Fe nanoparticles of ca. 50 nm in size were covered with a thin layer of a 3D hierarchical porous carbon network. When the Fe3O4/Fe/C hybrid is used as an active electrode material for an asymmetric supercapacitor with high energy density, the carbon layer is helpful to protect the surface and structural changes of Fe3O4/Fe nanoparticles in the electrode. The supercapacitor showed the capacitive performance of 272 F g−1 at 2 mV s−1 (Fig. 26). The Fe3O4/Fe/C hybrid showed a high capacitance of 600 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 with high capacity retention for 5000 cycles. Devi et al. developed an Fe3+-based MOG of H4BTA that bears peripheral poly-carboxyl groups.191 The FeBTA MOG was used to fabricate the Fe3O4/Fe/C composite via thermal treatment at 700 °C. The composite Fe3O4/Fe/C particles of ca. 40 nm in size were covered with a thin carbon matrix. The Fe3O4/Fe/C composite is an efficient electrocatalyst with an onset potential of 0.87 V and a current density of ca. −5 mA cm−2 for the ORR. RRDE measurements showed that the electrocatalyst follows a four-electron mechanism and has better durability than the Pt catalyst. When the composite was used as a supercapacitor, its specific capacitance was 245 F g−1 at 1 A g−1.

Zhang et al. reported that the homogeneous composite of FeBTC gel and NaCl was used as a template to fabricate porous supercapacitor materials.192 The incorporation of NaCl can increase the surface area and pore structure. Hierarchical porous Fe3C/carbon (HPF/C) or hierarchical porous carbon (HPC) was obtained after water or HCl etching (Fig. 25). The 3D porous network structure of HPF/C is composed of crosslinked nanosheets with micron-sized macropores. HPF/C was used for an assembled all-solid-state hybrid supercapacitor with a high specific capacity of 184.1 mA h g−1 (602.3 F g−1) at 1 A g−1. Additionally, it delivered a high energy density of 30.6 W h kg−1 at a power density of 600 W kg−1 and maintained an energy density of 15.5 W h kg−1 at a power density of 12000 W kg−1 (Fig. 26). The capacity retention rate was 86.5% after 10000 cycles.
Bimetallic MOGs have been employed as precursors for the fabrication of supercapacitors. Zhang et al. developed a La3+-containing FeBTC gel.193 The gel displayed spongy porous microstructures composed of interconnected particles. MIL-100-Fe MOF nanoparticles are considered to be basic building blocks. After the pyrolysis of the La-FeBTC gel precursor, LaFeO3 perovskite nanoparticles (ca. 20 nm) were obtained (Fig. 25). The derived LaFeO3 has the characteristics of both gels and MOFs. The material has a high surface area of 41 m2 g−1 with abundant mesopores. As an electrode material, it showed a high specific capacitance of 241.3 F g−1 (67.1 mA h g−1) at 1 A g−1 because its unique structure provides superior charge transfer ability. The derived LaFeO3 has been used to fabricate an all-solid-state symmetric supercapacitor to achieve a wide potential window of 1.8 V. An outstanding energy density of 34 W h kg−1 was achieved at a power density of 900 W kg−1 with 92.2% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles (Fig. 26). Bimetallic NiMn-BTC gels were developed by Zhong et al. by simply mixing metal ions (Ni2+ and Mn2+) and H3BTC.194 The bimetallic gel NiMn-3 MOG (the molar ratio of Ni/Mn is 3:1) possesses the morphology of laminated nanosheets. It has high conductivity of 1.12 S m−1. Electrochemical tests showed that the specific capacitance of NiMn-3 MOG reached 692.9 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 because of the synergistic effect between Ni2+ and Mn2+. Additionally, the material showed 84.6% specific capacitance retention with good durability after 5000 charge/discharge cycles at a high current density of 8 A g−1. The assembled NiMn-3 MOG//AC device exhibited an energy storage of 91.52 W h kg−1 at a power density of 850.03 W kg−1 (Fig. 26). The capacity retention rate was 84.54% after 5000 cycles, showing good cycling stability.
Carbon nanofibers (CNFs) were reported by Liu et al. to be generated from the organogel of the perylene diimide derivative PI.195 The PI gel consists of entangled nanofibers. After carbonization under Ar entangled CNFs with ca. 20–50 nm in diameter can be produced. The BET surface area was 100–200 m2 g−1. CNFs can be readily doped with Sn and N elements. Using K2SnO3 as an alkali introduces Sn/SnO2 into the CNFs. When melamine is used to crosslink precursor molecules, N-doped CNF is produced after carbonization. After pluronics F-127 was added to the melamine system as a template, the surface area of the resulting CNFs increased to 520 m2 g−1. The F-127-templated CNFs were used as electrode materials for supercapacitors with a specific capacitance of 346 F g−1 at the scan rate of 1 mV s−1 or 192 F g−1 at 1 A g−1.

7. Challenges and opportunities
In summary, several research works have demonstrated MOGs and MOG-derived materials as functional materials for electrochemical applications. MOGs are ideal candidates for electrochemical applications because MOGs and MOG-derived materials are a class of porous materials with controllable chemical composition, porosity, topological structure, and chemical stability. The synthesis of MOGs is simple under mild conditions. They can be designed with controlled chemistry. The synthesis of MOGs allows the precise integration of building blocks with different arrangements and functions into porous structures. More importantly, MOGs and their derivatives have high composition tunability. Multimetallic MOGs are readily obtained in contrast to other metal–organic materials (e.g., MOFs). Therefore, the design of MOGs provides conditions for the intelligent control of their performance. MOGs and MOG-derived materials widen the choice of active materials for electrochemical applications. The materials have been used as electrodes for applications such as water splitting, batteries, supercapacitors, sensors, and so on. The flexible design of electroactive MOGs has great potential in energy-related applications such as energy conversion and energy storage (such as capacitors and batteries), electrochemical energy generation (such as OER, HER, ORR, and fuel cells), electricity/ion conductors, and electrocatalysts.
Although significant progress has been made, the exploration of electroactive MOGs and their electrochemical applications is still in its infancy and there are still many challenges. Several technical challenges for the future development of electroactive MOGs must be resolved. The incorporation of redox-active moieties into the organic ligand may lead to an extensive catalogue of gel materials. Although MOGs with high surface area, excellent thermal, and chemical stability can be prepared, they are generally less conductive, and most of them are insulators or semiconductors. The moderate conductivity largely limits the MOGs' electrochemical applications and therefore, the development of conductive MOGs is essential. The optimization of the MOG internal structure is also required (for example, the introduction of electroactive building blocks or the introduction of conductive components). In addition, designing MOGs into nanostructures can enhance the accessible active surface while exposing more active sites. These efforts will help in the design of MOGs as electrode materials, and improve their electrode–electrolyte processes and durability.
Adjusting the chemical composition of MOGs by methods such as introducing heteroatoms (N, S, O, and B) is also a powerful technique for enhancing electrochemical behaviors (conductivity, capacitance, power, and energy density). MOGs with high-density heteroatom incorporation are also important. MOGs are ideal hosts for the incorporation of electroactive components. The composites may have superior electrochemical performances. The addition of modifiers or additives can increase the transmission channels and the number of ions, thus improving the conductivity. Composite materials of MOGs and graphene, CNT, or other conductive and electroactive polymers are also believed to enhance electrochemical activity. High-temperature carbonization treatments of MOGs are expected to result in derivatives with higher conductivity.
As hierarchical porous metal–organic materials, MOGs have, so far, been underdeveloped, unlike MOFs; MOGs have advantages over MOFs for device integration196,197 but there are limited examples for MOGs in comparison to MOFs, despite their similar properties. The strategies used for MOFs may be applied to MOGs. In addition, MOF nanoparticles can be employed as nanoscale building blocks for gels. MOF materials have the characteristics of controllable composition, large surface area, and high porosity. The incorporation of MOF nanoparticles into gels can improve the processability of MOFs and improve their cycling stability for practical applications.43,198,199
MOG electrolytes with high mechanical strength are important for the development of flexible batteries and devices. MOGs with enhanced mechanical properties are also attractive for material fabrication. For practical applications, integration with polymers or carbon nanomaterials may be needed for mechanically robust gels.200 The additives improve the mechanical properties of MOG electrolytes to possess both good conductivity and mechanical properties. The preparation of MOG membranes with suitable anisotropy, no cracks, and controllable thickness will improve proton conductivity and mechanical properties, thereby improving the efficiency of electrochemical devices.
MOGs have great prospects for actual energy storage and conversion applications. The use of MOGs as active materials for electrodes is still in its infancy. MOGs and MOG-derived materials are regarded as promising platforms for developing advanced electrocatalysts and electrodes. (1) Novel MOGs may be designed to understand the fundamental mechanisms of the interaction between the electrode and analyte, and the reactive kinetics and thermodynamics of the electrochemical processes. (2) Most electrocatalysts based on MOGs require high-temperature carbonization to achieve high-efficiency electrocatalysis. A small number of studies have directly used MOGs as electrocatalysts. We believe that MOGs' customizable chemical composition, high surface area and porosity, and inherent chemical and thermal stability are necessary characteristics for designing them as expected electroactive materials for electrochemical applications. (3) The practical applications are still limited in the field of electrochemical energy conversion and storage. It is important to broaden the applications of MOGs as catalysts for important electrocatalytic reactions, such as N2 reduction to NH3, nitrate/nitrite reduction, nitrobenzene reduction, hydrogen oxidation reaction, and benzyl alcohol oxidation. (4) Through specific structural design, MOGs can be explored to conduct other metal ions, such as Na+, K+, Zn2+, Mg2+, and Al3+, for the exploration of next-generation metal-ion batteries (Na+-ion, K+-ion, Zn2+-ion, Mg2+-ion, and Al3+-ion batteries), Zn–S batteries, and halide ion batteries. Additionally, MOG-based electrodes provide a unique platform for enhancing the sensitivity and selectivity for specific target analytes. The use of MOGs for electrochemical sensing has been applied to metal ions201,202 and small molecules such as diethylstilbestrol,203 glucose,204 and cholesterol.204 Considering good mass transfer in the hierarchical porosity of MOGs, MOGs are promising electrode materials for detecting large molecules.
