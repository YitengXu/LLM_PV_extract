    , Accepted 10th December 2019First published on 11th December 2019AbstractThe limiting power conversion efficiency (PCE) defines the theoretical maximum efficiency of photovoltaic devices. The classic Shockley–Queisser method has predicted 33% for a single p–n junction solar cell under AM1.5G illumination, but those for alternative photovoltaic materials and under other illumination conditions are not well-established. The emergence of indoor photovoltaics (IPVs) generates considerable interest in this regard. Here, we explore how thin-film photovoltaic materials with different bandgaps, absorption properties, and thicknesses, perform as IPV devices. We show a material bandgap of 1.82–1.96 eV to allow a limiting 51–57% PCE for a single-junction device under various indoor illuminations. In addition, typical organic photovoltaic thin films of ∼100 nm only give limiting PCEs of merely ∼28%, but >40% for a 200–250 nm thick device making use of the second thickness peak. We also present the limiting device parameters under different illuminance, serving as a comprehensive guide for emergent IPV development. The limiting PCE and the optimal Voc depend only weakly on the indoor light source and the domestic illuminance (100–1000 lx). In contrast, the limiting Jsc increases linearly with the illuminance (∼11–13 μA cm−2/100 lx). Our study offers an explicit reference for evaluating the quality of an IPV device and a guideline for future material selection for efficient IPVs.
1 Introduction
Indoor lights have an illuminance of 100–1000 lx, which corresponds roughly to an incident power intensity of ∼100 μW cm−2. This amount of energy flux is about 1000 times weaker than the standard outdoor irradiance (AM1.5G) of 100 mW cm−2. Because of the low energy flux, indoor photovoltaics (IPV) has not been seriously considered to have practical and broad applications. However, with the advent of IoT objects which are expected to have low power consumption, this situation is now under re-examination.1–3 Among different materials for IPV, organic photovoltaic (OPV) materials are playing increasingly important roles.1 Devices with high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) exceeding 20% have been reported.4–9 For example, a highly efficient IPV device with a PCE of 28% has been achieved using the donor benzodithiophene terthiophene rhodanine (BTR) blended with the fullerene acceptor under a 1000 lx fluorescent lamp.10 Large-area devices of 1 cm2 with a PCE of 22% using PBDB-TF:ITCC have also been reported under LED illumination of 1000 lx.11 A comprehensive report on the latest, state-of-the-art IPV materials has been provided by Venkateswararao et al.12 Despite the impressive progress, there is no detailed knowledge on the limiting device parameters that can be achieved under indoor lighting conditions. These parameters are expected to depend on the optical and electronic properties of the IPV light absorbers as well as the kind of incident light source and the illumination level. From an experimental point of view, knowledge of these parameters should provide very useful guidance for device design, assessment, and optimization.
In this contribution, we address this knowledge gap by presenting comprehensive IPV device limiting parameters under different kinds of indoor light sources. They include fluorescent lamps, light-emitting diode (LED) light tubes, and white organic LEDs (WOLEDs) with different color temperatures. Because universal indoor light sources do not exist, we will present a general scheme for computing the incident power intensity (Pin) for any given indoor light source, using its emission spectrum and the illuminance level. From the well-known Shockley-Queisser (SQ) method and knowledge of Pin, we derive the SQ-limited PCEs, open-circuit voltages (Voc), and short-circuit current densities (Jsc). We show that for ideal light absorbers, a bandgap of about 1.82–1.96 eV would allow a theoretical PCE between 51 and 57%. The SQ-analysis further predicts an SQ-limited Voc = (1.4 ± 0.1) V at the optimized effective bandgap, and a Jsc between 12 and 143 μA cm−2 for an illuminance level between 100 and 1000 lx. The limiting PCE and Voc are only weakly dependent on the kind of indoor light source and the illumination level. In contrast, the limiting Jsc has approximately a linear dependence on the illuminance, with a maximum value of coefficient of ∼11–13 μA cm−2 per 100 lx. For OPV indoor light absorbers, a common film thickness of 100 nm is often used for IPV cell fabrication and performance assessment, but such a thickness is far from ideal. For example, for a typical bulk heterojunction (BHJ) of PTB7:PC71BM, the maximum achievable PCE is merely ∼28% which is far below the ideal PCE of ≈50%. On the other hand, if this thickness is increased to 200–250 nm, which corresponds to the second thickness peak for constructive interference for the incident photons, the PCE can be enhanced to >40% (assuming that charge extraction is not sensitive to such a thickness change). Our results offer a straightforward strategy to maximize the PCE of a practical organic IPV device.
2 Calculation scheme of the Shockley–Queisser limit
The SQ-limited efficiency ηSQ can be computed using13,14 ηSQ = ηu × ηd × ηFF.(1)
The ultimate efficiency ηu, the detailed-balance efficiency ηd and the fill factor ηFF are the three sources of device energy loss. The ultimate efficiency loss originates from the subgap absorption loss and the energy loss of high-energy electron–hole (e–h) pairs relaxing to the band edges. Detailed balance efficiency loss results from the unavoidable radiative recombination at temperatures above 0 K. The fill factor (FF) loss originates from the non-square diode behavior of the current–voltage (I–V) characteristics. The model calculation assumptions are the same as the classical one.13 The FF of Green's empirical form is used.15 The detailed discussion on eqn (1) is provided in the ESI.†
To calculate ηSQ in eqn (1), we need the incident power intensity Pin. However, Pin is not fixed for indoor light sources. It depends on the kind of indoor light as well as the illuminance level. There are various kinds of indoor light sources and color temperatures. Table 1 shows as examples the emission spectra of a fluorescent lamp and an LED lamp. A full set of light sources for Pin and PCE evaluations including warm, natural and cool white fluorescent lamps, LED lamps and WOLEDs are shown in the ESI (Table S1†). There, we also include the AM1.5G illumination and the halogen lamp (in the ESI†) which emit blackbody-like radiation as the control light sources. Since indoor lights are measured in photometric units (illuminance L, in the unit of lx) we need to convert L to radiometric units (irradiance, in the units of W cm−2) for the computation of Pin. The relationship between the L and Pin is given by4,16–19 (2)where (3)is the normalized emission spectrum of the light source such that . Examples of Snorm(λ) are shown in Table 1. They were acquired with an OceanOptics USB4000 spectrophotometer. Pin represents the total incident power intensity. Kr = 683.002 lm W−1 is the maximum spectral luminous efficacy for human photopic vision, and V(λ) is the spectral luminous efficiency function for human photopic vision characterizing the spectral sensitivity of human eyes.20,21 In practice, illuminance of cold light sources is recommended to be measured with a Class A or L NIST-traceable LED lux meter or illuminance spectrophotometer for better accuracy.12 Using eqn (2) and (3), we can calculate the irradiance Pin of various light sources as a function of illuminance L. Fig. 1 is a summary of such calculations. Under low light illumination of ∼200 lx, Pin ∼ 50 μW cm−2; but under bright light illumination of ∼1000 lx, Pin goes up to ∼300 μW cm−2. Still, compared to the AM1.5G illumination with Pin = 100 mW cm−2, indoor cold light sources have 100–1000 times lower irradiance. The integral in eqn (2), denoted as ϕ, indicates the level of matching between the light source emission spectrum and the human eye sensitivity. The better the match, the greater the value of ϕ. Different light sources have different levels of matching, so the value of Pin varies across the light sources at a particular illuminance.

The normalized emission spectrum of each light source is shown. The color temperatures are depicted in the format of “nominal/calculated from the emission spectrum”. The photopic matching index ϕ for the light sources is included, defined as . The values serve as an example; they may vary according to the light source model and thus are for reference only.

3 Limit of device efficiency and parameters for indoor photovoltaics

Fig. 2(a) shows the SQ-limited efficiencies ηSQ for various indoor light sources under 300 lx. It is clearly seen that ηSQ reaches a maximum value of ∼57% at bandgap energies Eg between 1.82 and 1.96 eV (681–632 nm). The ηSQ values for cold light sources are, therefore, significantly higher than that of AM1.5G (∼33% at 1.1 eV or ∼1130 nm). The blueshift of the optimal bandgap arises because of the absence of the IR emission for the cold light sources (Table 1). Furthermore, ηSQ ought to increase because of the narrower emission spectra. This reduces the dispersion of the incident photon energy. Both subgap absorption loss and relaxation loss are suppressed. Therefore the value of ηSQ and the corresponding optimal Eg have only a weak dependence on the type of cold light source and the color temperature as long as the emission band is similar (Table S1†). Spectral features of the light sources affect little the efficiency and the optimal Eg. This implies the universality of the optimal conditions for IPVs.
 Fig. 2  (a) The Shockley–Queisser (SQ) limited power conversion efficiency (PCE) vs. bandgap energy Eg for different white light sources: sunlight (AM1.5G) and warm white fluorescent (FL) lamps, phosphor light-emitting diode (LED) light tubes and white organic LEDs (WOLEDs). The illuminance of all artificial light sources, except AM1.5G, is taken to be 300 lx. (b) The SQ-limited PCE at the optimal bandgap energy for various cold light sources at different color temperatures vs. illuminance. These values are tabulated in Table 1. Fig. S3† gives a complete set of light sources. 

Fig. 2(b) shows the effect of illuminance on ηSQ. The value of ηSQ only increases marginally with Pin between 100 and 1000 lx. This shows that IPVs are very tolerant to the indoor lighting conditions. The little difference across various light sources is explained as follows. Fluorescent lamps have slightly higher ηSQ because of the sharper emission peaks compared to LEDs and WOLEDs. The almost unchanged optimal Eg observed only in fluorescent lamps [Table S1(a)†] is due to the unshifted emission peak at ≈610 nm. For LEDs and WOLEDs with broader-peak spectra, higher color temperatures give lower ηSQ due to the decreased proportion of the red region emission which is near to Eg, resulting in more energy loss from thermal relaxation. The optimal efficiency is therefore achieved by increasing Eg.
The SQ-limited Voc can be predicted by qVSQoc = ηdEg [Fig. 3 and S4(c)†]. If a material matching the optimal Eg of the cold light sources is chosen, the theoretical highest Voc can reach (1.4 ± 0.1) V. Substituting the optimal Voc, the maximum Jsc and the dark current obtained from the detailed balance treatment into the one-diode model,22 the voltage at the maximum power point can go up to ∼90% of Voc. This means an operating voltage of ∼1.2 V is possible. The difference, i.e. Eg/q − VSQoc, due to radiative recombination in the consideration of detailed balance is also depicted as numbers in the columns in Fig. 3. It increases from ∼0.3 V under the AM1.5G condition to 0.45–0.50 V under room light illumination. The values of the Voc loss under room light depend barely on the light source. In Fig. 3, the error bar for each column indicates the range of VSQoc for the illuminance (L) range of 100–1000 lx. The increase of Voc in each case is less than 0.1 V as L increases because Voc increases logarithmically with irradiance (or illuminance) [Fig. S4(a), eqn (S3) and (S4)†]. The logarithmic dependence suggests a relation of ΔVocL, the Voc reduction as compared to the Voc under the AM1.5G condition:4 (4)where Psunin = 100 mW cm−2 and Proomin are the incident power intensities of the AM1.5G condition and the room light illumination respectively, n is the ideality factor and θ ≈ 61.8% is the fraction of solar energy in the visible region and above (<830 nm). Psuninθ gives the effective incident power intensity on the PV device, excluding the IR radiation which does not contribute to photo-generation (and hence Voc). Under an illuminance of 100–1000 lx, there is an additional Voc loss of 0.20–0.14 V compared to the AM1.5G measurement (Fig. 3).23 For the same kind of systems, the reduction of Voc is barely dependent on the materials chosen [Fig. S4(b)†]. Overall speaking, Voc is very stable under various lighting conditions and material systems.
 Fig. 3  The Shockley–Queisser limited open-circuit voltage VSQoc (dark columns) at the optimal bandgap energy Eg,opt (light overlaid columns) for various light sources. The error bars indicate the range of Voc in the illuminance range of 100 and 1000 lx. The numbers in the columns are the Voc losses due to radiative recombination in the detailed-balance treatment. The values of Eg,opt and VSQoc are tabulated in Tables 1 and S1.† 
A common concern of accurate IPV PCE evaluation is the overestimation of Jsc.24 It is obvious that the measured Jsc should not exceed the incidence-limited current density JPin, which is defined by the current generated under the assumption that every photon emitted from the light source is converted to one charge carrier. JPin can be computed using the emission spectra of the light sources (Table 1). Fig. 4 summarizes the limiting Jsc (=JPin) of cold light sources. It reaches 124–143 μA cm−2 at 1000 lx. If the measured Jsc exceeds or is too close to the limiting values, there may be some experimental errors. From Fig. 4, the current increases linearly with the illuminance, with a coefficient of 11.0–13.4 μA cm−2 per 100 lx (Table 1). Different light sources generate different limiting currents at the same illuminance because of their different Pin and emission spectra.
 Fig. 4  The incidence-limited current density JPinvs. illuminance for various warm-white cold-light sources. JPin is defined by the current density contributed by all incident photons. The values of fluorescent and LED lamps are tabulated in Table 1. Fig. S5† gives a complete set of light sources. 
From an empirical point of view, material absorbers for IPV possess a bandgap and not all incident photons are absorbed. Thus the resulting measured Jsc will always be less than JPin. To investigate the effect of the bandgap energy Eg on Jsc, we also computed the Jsc of perfect absorbers with different bandgaps. Fig. 5 summarizes the results for different light sources. The value of JSQsc saturates at Eg < 1.5 eV (>830 nm), the red-end tail of the cold light source. At a fixed illuminance, JSQsc decreases with the effective bandgap. It should be noted that the value of JSQsc at the optimal bandgap (≈1.9 eV) is very close to JPin. So materials of large Eg near the optimal can still give large Jsc. A material bandgap lower than the optimal does not give distinct Jsc improvement. However, an effective bandgap greater than the optimal value significantly decreases Jsc and PCE [Fig. 2(a)]. The above numbers are good reference to the measured parameters to justify how far the device is from the limiting performance. If the numbers are greater than the limiting values, it can be often traced to incorrect experimental designs or measurements.

Note JSQsc tends to saturate once the effective bandgap reaches the optimal value (1.5–1.9 eV). For Eg < 1.5 eV, there is almost no further increase of JSQsc. The shaded regions represent the range of JSQsc at the particular Eg using fluorescent lamps (FLs) [solid lines], LEDs [dashed lines] and WOLEDs [dotted lines]. 
4 Absorber thickness considerations
In the previous discussion, we assume that the IPV absorbers are perfect and they absorb 100% of the incident photons with energies larger than their Eg's. In reality, real IPV devices are fabricated with materials with finite thicknesses. For example, for IPV cells with OPV materials, the common thickness of the absorbers is ∼100 nm.25,26 Such a thickness facilitates charge extraction.27,28 But at the same time, it could reduce the amount of absorbed photon flux, leading to smaller PCEs.29 To correct the effect of the film thickness, we can re-consider ηu in eqn (1) and rewrite it as (5)where ϒ(λ) = 1 − 10−A(λ) is the optical absorptance in wavelength of the absorber, which is the percentage of the light absorbed at the particular wavelength. A(λ) is the absorbance of the absorber film measured by a UV-visible spectrometer (HP 8453). If we assume that the absorber follows the Beer–Lambert law, it can be written as A(λ) = ln10α(λ)l, where α(λ) and l are the absorption coefficient and the thickness of the film respectively. Eqn (5) states that in estimating the limiting efficiency of real devices, the absorption spectrum and the film thickness l should be considered in addition to the light source specifications. Fig. 6(a) shows, as an example, the absorbance spectra of the PTB7:PC71BM film of different thicknesses. The corresponding optical absorptance ϒ(λ) is given in Fig. 6(b). Thin films possessing poor optical absorptance (small ϒ(λ)) result in lower spectra absorbed by the blend, as shown in Fig. 6(c), which is the product of Fig. 6(b) and the emission spectrum of the 3000 K LED (Table 1). Fig. 6(d) shows the effect of film thickness on the maximum PCE. With a 100 nm film, only ∼55% of the incident photons is absorbed. The limited absorption results in a maximum PCE of only about 28%, which is far below the limiting 51% PCE for the perfect absorber. In contrast, when l ≈ 250 nm, ∼86% of the incident photons can be absorbed. The maximum PCE becomes 44%, approaching the SQ limit. A thickness of l ∼ 500 nm can even give the necessarily SQ-limited maximum PCE of ≈50%. In practice, the film thickness can be optimized at the second optical interference peak, which is usually between 200 and 250 nm.30Fig. 6(d) also shows the relative absorptance difference of the film at 683 nm and 533 nm (Δrelϒ). The difference decreases with thickness, from 11% at 100 nm to only 5–7% at 200–250 nm. This reveals that the thick-film strategy is the most direct method to enhance the PCE of an IPV cell that employs organic semiconductor absorbers. We conclude that for OPV cells the thick film strategy is a straightforward but rational method to improve the PCE under indoor environments.

Finally, we would like to make a short comment on the FF loss under various illumination conditions. The FF behavior is complex as it depends on the material and device design, illumination conditions and so on. When isolating the current leakage due to pinholes and edge effects, and assuming a uniform film of perfect interface, a general convex shape of the FF curve vs. irradiance can be observed.31–36 When decreasing the irradiance from 1 sun, the FF rises gradually and reaches a maximum in the range of 0.01–0.4 sun (1000–40000 lx). The enhanced FF can be attributed to the reduced bimolecular recombination.35,37–39 Decreasing the irradiance further from the FF maximum point, a fall-off may be observed. This is dominated by the trap-assisted recombination.38 A trap-free IPV device would give a plateau of the FF curve in this region.34,40 The enhanced FF at reduced illuminance is an additional merit for IPV devices.
5 Conclusion
The fundamental PCE limits for photovoltaic cells under the illumination of indoor white light sources were investigated. These sources include fluorescent lamps, phosphor LED light tubes, halogen lamps and WOLEDs with different color temperatures and illuminance. Using the classic Shockley–Queisser (SQ) approach, a maximum PCE of about 51–57% is predicted with cold light sources when the effective energy gap of the IPV material is between 1.82 and 1.96 eV. The result is weakly dependent on the type of cold light source and the illuminance levels. Such an optimal gap matches well with the bandgaps of various organic semiconducting polymers designed for OPV applications under sunlight. If only radiative losses are included, the SQ calculation predicts devices of large Voc up to (1.4 ± 0.1) V. The little variation of Voc confirmed an encouraging tolerance for IPV under various illumination conditions. The incidence-limited Jsc lies in the range of 12–143 μA cm−2 under 100–1000 lx. It follows a rate of increase of ∼12–14 μA cm−2 per 100 lx. In addition, we analyze how the PV layer thickness affects the maximum PCE. For IPV devices with OPV absorbers, the common thickness ∼100 nm only allows a maximum PCE of ∼ 28%. When the thickness increases to 200–250 nm, the maximum PCE rises to >40%. Our analysis suggests that OPV cells for indoor applications should adopt a thick film strategy.

 	Fig. 1  The incident power intensity Pin of selected indoor light sources as a function of illuminance. These values are tabulated in Table 1. Fig. S2† gives a complete set of light sources.	 

 	Fig. 2  (a) The Shockley–Queisser (SQ) limited power conversion efficiency (PCE) vs. bandgap energy Eg for different white light sources: sunlight (AM1.5G) and warm white fluorescent (FL) lamps, phosphor light-emitting diode (LED) light tubes and white organic LEDs (WOLEDs). The illuminance of all artificial light sources, except AM1.5G, is taken to be 300 lx. (b) The SQ-limited PCE at the optimal bandgap energy for various cold light sources at different color temperatures vs. illuminance. These values are tabulated in Table 1. Fig. S3† gives a complete set of light sources.

 	Fig. 3  The Shockley–Queisser limited open-circuit voltage VSQoc (dark columns) at the optimal bandgap energy Eg,opt (light overlaid columns) for various light sources. The error bars indicate the range of Voc in the illuminance range of 100 and 1000 lx. The numbers in the columns are the Voc losses due to radiative recombination in the detailed-balance treatment. The values of Eg,opt and VSQoc are tabulated in Tables 1 and S1.†	 

 	Fig. 4  The incidence-limited current density JPinvs. illuminance for various warm-white cold-light sources. JPin is defined by the current density contributed by all incident photons. The values of fluorescent and LED lamps are tabulated in Table 1. Fig. S5† gives a complete set of light sources.	 

 	Fig. 5  The Shockley–Queisser limited short-circuit current density JSQscvs. illuminance of materials of various effective bandgaps Eg under (a) warm white light, (b) natural white and (c) cool white lights. Note JSQsc tends to saturate once the effective bandgap reaches the optimal value (1.5–1.9 eV). For Eg < 1.5 eV, there is almost no further increase of JSQsc. The shaded regions represent the range of JSQsc at the particular Eg using fluorescent lamps (FLs) [solid lines], LEDs [dashed lines] and WOLEDs [dotted lines].
