    , Accepted 10th November 2020First published on 11th November 2020AbstractAnion exchange reactions in lead halide perovskites provide post-treatment methods to functionalize and modulate their photoelectric properties. However, the mechanism of anion exchange reactions is still fiercely debated. Herein, by investigating time-dependent in situ PL spectra after mixing CsPbBr3 and CsPb(Br0.09/I0.91)3 perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs), the anion exchange process is divided into three stages, i.e. photon reabsorption process, initial anion exchange, and adequate anion exchange. This model is broadly applicable to different situations, ignoring the mixing order or molar ratios between Br and I. This work provides a dynamic model to describe the anion exchange of CsPbX3 PNCs, which will not only add fundamental knowledge to the stability of PNCs, but also guide the post-treatment of PNCs.
Introduction
Since the first report of cesium lead halide (CsPbX3, X = Cl, Br, and I) perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs) by Kovalenko et al.,1 they have attracted significant research interest due to their outstanding optoelectronic properties, such as a high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY), tunable band gaps, narrow emission widths, and high defect tolerance.2–6 Based on these excellent properties, PNCs were widely applied in optoelectronic devices, such as light emitting diodes (LEDs), solar cells, and lasers.7–13 The PLQYs of single halogen CsPbI3 and CsPbCl3 PNCs, synthesized by general hot-injection1 or supersaturated recrystallization methods,14 are usually very low, which greatly limited their application in blue and red LEDs. Anion exchange affords a facile method to synthesize PNCs with various emission wavelengths covering the entire visible spectrum, and such a post-treatment greatly improves the PLQY and stability of PNCs.15–18 Kido et al.19 fabricated CsPb(Br/I)3 perovskite quantum dots by mixing pure CsPbBr3 quantum dots with halide-anion-containing alkyl ammonium and aryl ammonium salts. The pure red LEDs based on these anion-exchange quantum dots exhibited an external quantum efficiency of 21.3%.
Generally, anion exchange usually reacts at a fast speed, which roughly depends on the concentration and type of reactants. The whole reaction process finishes in a few minutes, causing the reactions to become uncontrollable. To avoid this limitation, Son et al. used di-halomethane solvent molecules as commutative anion sources, which only disintegrate and produce halide ions under excitation light. Therefore, the anion exchange process was easily controlled by changing the photon dose or wavelength of excitation light.20 Anion exchange can be achieved by adding different halides into pure PNCs. In addition to the improved PLQY and stability, other features were also exhibited. For example, Kim et al. used haloalkane solvents (CHCl3, CHBr3, CH3CH2I) to start anion exchange with PNCs; with the assistance of nucleophilic trialkyl phosphines, the reactions were successfully controlled by changing the nucleophile concentration. In addition, the reaction process could be repeated in any direction (CsPbCl3 ⇔ CsPbBr3 ⇔ CsPbI3), then they synthesized full-color luminescent PNCs without loss of the original structure.21 The above studies are all performed in the liquid phase, in fact, anion exchange can also occur in the solid phase and gaseous phase.22,23 Stratakis et al. embedded CsPbBr3 PNCs into a polymer matrix, then put them into the Cl2 or HI gas atmosphere to start anion exchange reactions. Solid–gaseous phase anion exchange was achieved by controlling the concentration of gas and exposure time.24
Among the above various anion exchange reactions, the most convenient, efficient, and direct method to get PNCs with different emission wavelengths is the mixing of two kinds of pre-synthetic perovskites.25,26 However, there are yet many unexplained effects. For example, Zeng et al.27 observed the halide migration between CH3NH3PbI3 film and CsPbBr3 quantum dots (QDs), when CsPbBr3 QDs were deposited on the CH3NH3PbI3 film. At the CH3NH3PbI3/CsPbBr3 interface, the I–Br exchange is driven by strong halogen bonding interaction. A gradient energy level forms due to the interfacial transition. During the exchange reactions, the morphology of the perovskite film and CsPbBr3 QDs is well preserved. However, Tian et al.28 proposed a lattice reconstruction model to explain the anion exchange, which suggests that the perovskite nanocrystals disintegrate before anion exchange. Thus, it is debated whether the morphology of perovskite is preserved during anion exchange. Anion exchange has also been investigated at the single-particle level.29–31 Masuo et al.30 solidified CsPbBr3 PNCs in poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) films, and then dropped a certain amount of PbI2 solutions on the films to start anion exchange reactions. During the formation of CsPb(Brx/I1−x)3 PNCs, in situ single-photon emission at the single-particle level was recoded. Even under excitation of high laser powers, there was only a single peak in the PL spectra. Therefore, they confirmed that only one emission site existed in the single CsPb(BrxI1−x) PNC, indicating that the inhomogeneous halide composition formed the same band gap as a whole nanocrystal like a quantum dot instead of inhomogeneous alloyed heterostructures,32 which is contradictory to Zeng et al.'s conclusion.27 Therefore, the mechanism of anion exchange between PNCs still needs to be further clarified.
In this work, time-dependent in situ PL spectra of anion exchange reactions were obtained by mixing CsPbBr3 and CsPb(Br0.09/I0.91)3 PNCs. We recorded PL curves per second in the first minute and every 5 seconds after it. By analysing the time-dependent PL spectra, we divided the anion exchange reactions into three stages, including photon reabsorption, initial anion exchange, and adequate anion exchange. And we also found the proposed model is universally tenable when the two parent PNCs mixed in different orders and at different ratios.
Experimental
Materials
Cesium carbonate (Cs2CO3, 99.9%, Aladdin), lead bromide (PbBr2, 99.0%, Aladdin), lead iodide (PbI2, 99.9%, Aladdin), oleic acid (OA, 99%, Macklin), oleylamine (OAm, 80–90%, Aladdin), 1-octadecene (ODE, >90%, Aladdin), and n-hexane (97%, Aladdin).
Synthesis of CsPbX3 nanocrystals
The CsPbBr3 and CsPb(Br0.09/I0.91)3 PNCs were synthesized by a two-step hot-injection method with slight modification.1 In the first step, Cs2CO3 (0.4 g), OA (1.5 ml) and ODE (20 ml) were added into a 100 ml three-neck flask together, and dried for 1 hour under vacuum atmosphere at 110 °C, then heated up to 150 °C after the three-neck flask was full up with N2. Until all Cs2CO3 were reacted with OA and the Cs–oleate solution became clear, the product was collected in an airtight glass container.
In the second step, for synthesis of CsPbBr3 PNCs, PbBr2 (0.138 g) was added into a 100 ml three-neck flask together with ODE (10 ml), OA (1 ml), and OAm (1 ml). For synthesis of CsPb(Br0.09/I0.91)3 PNCs, PbBr2 (0.046 g) and PbI2 (0.1146 g) were added. The mixtures were dried under a vacuum atmosphere for 1 hour at 110 °C, then heat up to 170 °C after the three-neck flask was full up with N2. When all PbX2 salts dissolved, 0.8 ml Cs–oleate solution was quickly injected, and 5 s later, the reaction mixture was cooled down by an ice-water bath.
The crude solution was further centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 5 min, then the supernatant was poured away, and the precipitate was dissolved in 5 ml hexane. Subsequently, the solution was centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 5 min for several times until no precipitate appeared, and the supernatant was collected in an airtight glass container and stored in a refrigerator.

In situ PL monitoring of the anion exchange reactions
Anion exchange reactions were performed at room temperature, and in situ PL spectra were obtained by a Maya 2000 Pro high sensitivity spectrometer (Ocean Optics). One kind of PNCs were firstly excited by a 450 nm-continuous laser in a cuvette, and another PNCs were quickly added into the cuvette, meanwhile, the PL curves were recorded continuously. For the experimental results shown in Fig. 2–4, 0.05 ml CsPb(Br0.09/I0.91)3 solution was added into the 0.1 ml CsPbBr3 solution. For the results shown in Fig. 5, 0.1 ml CsPbBr3 solution was added into 0.3 ml CsPb(Br0.09/I0.91)3 solution. For the results shown in Fig. 6, 0.1 ml CsPbBr3 solutions were added into the 0.05 ml, 0.2 ml and 0.3 ml CsPbBr3 solutions, respectively.
Results and discussion
As shown in Fig. 1, two typical models have been put forward to explain the anion exchange between PNCs. Fig. 1a illustrates the lattice reconstruction model proposed by Tian et al.28 that contains three steps: disintegration, anion exchange, and lattice reconstruction. According to the lattice reconstruction model, the PL intensity of two kinds of PNCs will quench at the beginning due to the disintegration step. Then two PL curves will gradually reappear and merge during the anion exchange process, which is caused by the concentration gradient and chemical potential gradient. Fig. 1b shows the general anion exchange model, which contains very little details. The green and red arrows present the tracks of Br and I anions, respectively. Both free Br and I anions, as well as corresponding vacancies, are generated driven by the concentration gradient. The generated Br and I anions will shuttle back and forth between the PNCs until the systems reach the homogeneous state. According to the general anion exchange model, the two PL peaks corresponding to the two kinds of PNCs synchronously changes, oppositely shifts and gradually merges.

In order to investigate the anion exchange reactions between two kinds of PNCs, CsPbBr3 and CsPb(Br0.09/I0.91)3 PNCs are mixed. The TEM images with size distribution diagrams are shown in Fig. S1 and S2 (ESI†), indicating the sizes of CsPbBr3 and CsPb(Br0.09/I0.91)3 PNCs are about 9 nm and 10 nm, respectively. The absorption spectra of CsPbBr3 and CsPb(Br0.09/I0.91)3 PNCs are shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†), the absorption edges locate at about 528 nm and 680 nm, which are consistent with their PL peaks. The fluorescent images before and after mixing are shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†). The initial two samples show the green and red fluorescence, respectively. During the anion exchange process the orange fluorescence gradually appears. The PL curves are recorded in situ with very small-time intervals. The whole anion exchange process is divided into three stages according to the spectral feature. The initial stage is shown in Fig. 2a. From early 2 s to 6 s, designated as stage 1, it is clear that both the 520 nm-emission PL peak and 670 nm-emission PL peak exist, corresponding to the emissions of CsPbBr3 and CsPb(Br0.09/I0.91)3 PNCs, respectively. To understand it more clearly, the peak positions and peak intensities versus interaction time are shown in Fig. 2b and c. Fig. 2b shows that the PL intensity of CsPbBr3 decreases gradually while the PL intensity of CsPb(Br0.09/I0.91)3 increases gradually. Whereas both the PL peak positions of CsPbBr3 and CsPb(Br0.09/I0.91)3 remain unchanged (Fig. 2c), indicating the crystalline structures of the two PNCs are complete without structural destruction. It is easy to understand that there is no anion exchange during this initial stage. Since the anion exchange is essentially a chemical reaction, which cannot occur until these two PNCs are well blended.

(b and c) Plots of PL intensity (b) and PL peak position (c) versus time. (d and e) Schematic illustrations of the photon reabsorption process between two PNCs based on band structure (d) and 3D structure (e). 
As shown schematically in Fig. 2d, the band gaps of CsPbBr3 and CsPb(Br0.09/I0.91)3 are about 2.384 eV and 1.851 eV, respectively, implying the photons emitted by CsPbBr3 can be reabsorbed by CsPb(Br0.09/I0.91)3 and then emit fluorescence at a wavelength of 670 nm. The 520 nm-emissions of the cubic CsPbBr3 PNCs are partly reabsorbed by the cubic CsPb(Br0.09/I0.91)3 PNCs, leading to the partial quenching of PL 520 nm-emission, while the re-emitted photons enhance the 670 nm-fluorescence (Fig. 2e).
Normally, the optical absorption is an ultrafast process and the photon reabsorption completes at a timescale of nanoseconds.33,34 We would like to point out that the evolution of PL spectra from 2 s to 6 s is caused by the enhanced photon reabsorption due to the gradually increased dispersion of different PNCs rather than the photon reabsorption itself which takes a time of 2 s to 6 s. Namely, the time different-photon reabsorption process suggests the mixture changes from inhomogeneous to homogeneous. Thus, photon reabsorption can be considered as a measure of mixing degree. The contact between different kinds of PNCs ensured by homogeneously mixing is a prerequisite for ion exchange. Therefore, photon reabsorption is strongly related with ion exchange, which is neglected in previous work.26,28 As shown in Fig. 2c, the PL intensity of CsPbBr3 decreases from 35000 photon-counts per second (PCS) to 22000 PCS, while the PL intensity of CsPb(Br0.09/I0.91)3 only increases from 2300 to 3500 PCS. This can be rationalized by the low PLQY of CsPb(Br0.09/I0.91)3. Supposing all the quench photons of 520 nm are absorbed by CsPb(Br0.09/I0.91)3, they will not be equally converted to 670 nm photons by CsPb(Br0.09/I0.91)3.
There are also other forms of energy transfer, such as charge transfer and Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET). Here, the PNCs are dispersed in hexane solution without electron transport channel, which cuts the pathway of charge transfer. On the other hand, the contribution of FRET is very minor. In the original few seconds, the mixture is inhomogeneous, thus the distances between two kinds of PNCs are beyond the short distances required by FRET (typically about 10 nm),40 indicating FRET is unlikely. However, the photon reabsorption could universally exist in different anion exchange systems due to the high optical absorption coefficient and high PLQY of PNCs.33,34 Therefore, we mainly consider photon reabsorption in this work.
The subsequent duration from 7 s to 21 s is classified to stage 2, as shown in Fig. 3. In this stage, the two separated PL peaks can still be well resolved. According to Fig. 3b and c, the PL intensity of CsPbBr3 PNCs obviously decreases with the remarkable red-shift of PL position from 520 nm to 535 nm. As well accepted, the mixed-halide CsPb(Br0.09/I0.91)3 PNCs suffer from phase separation and ion migration under the excitation,38 which are more unstable than CsPbBr3 PNCs. In solar cells, ion migration greatly influences the stability of the devices.39 As shown schematically in Fig. 3d, a small amount of I ions are generated due to the instability of CsPb(Br0.09/I0.91)3 PNCs. Then, the free I ions dope the CsPbBr3 PNCs, leading to the redshift of 520 nm-PL peak. Since the PLQY of CsPb(Br/I)3 is normally lower than CsPbBr3, the 520 nm-PL intensity decreases at this initial anion exchange stage. Although, a small amount of I vacancies appear in the CsPb(Br0.09/I0.91)3 PNCs, the PL only slightly changed due to the high defect tolerance.35

(b and c) Plots of PL intensity (b) and PL peak position (c) versus time. (d) Schematic illustration of the initial anion exchange stage. 
Note Br vacancies also may be generated in CsPbBr3 PNCs. However, the generation of Br vacancies cannot be the reason for the remarkable red-shift.36,37 Sebastian et al. proposed that the Br vacancy causes a level state of 0.23 eV above the conduction-band edge.36 The Br vacancy-induced emission peak at the higher energy side of the dominant PL peak also has been experimentally observed through the temperature-dependent PL.37 Our work reveals the generations of different free anions are asynchronous due to their different structural stabilities, which is a negation of the general anion exchange model shown in Fig. 1b.
After experiencing the two early stages above, the adequate anion exchange between the two kinds of PNCs starts. As shown in Fig. 4a, the PL peaks of CsPbBr3 and CsPb(Br0.09/I0.91)3 show different variations. This stage experiences a long period from 22 s to 225 s. The PL peak intensities and PL peak positions of the two PNCs are plotted in Fig. 4b and c. The PL intensity of CsPbBr3 gradually increases, and keeps constant at last, while the PL intensity of CsPb(Br0.09/I0.91)3 gradually decreases and finally disappears. Meanwhile, the PL positions of the two PNCs show opposite movements. The PL position of CsPbBr3 continuously red-shifts while the PL position of CsPb(Br0.09/I0.91)3 continuously blue-shifts. During this period, two PL peaks move towards each other, then gradually merge into a single whole and finally stay at the position between two parent components, which is the typical behaviour of the anion exchange process and consistent with the previous reports.25,26 It is worth noting that the final disappearance of CsPb(Br0.09/I0.91)3 PL curves does not represent the lattice disintegration. The final peak position is determined by the atomic ratio of Br and I. In this case, the final peak position (543 nm) is far from 670 nm due to the high fraction of Br. It looks like the 670 nm-PL peak suddenly disappears. Essentially, the initial 670 nm-peak largely blueshift to 543 nm. More discussion can be found in the explanations for the anion exchange with different atomic ratios of Br and I. TEM image of the final CsPb(Br0.34/I0.66)3 PNCs is shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†). The PNCs are cubic with average sizes about 10.2 nm. TEM results suggest the crystal structures and morphologies basically remain constant during the anion exchange, which is in good agreement with the X-ray diffraction (XRD) results (Fig. S6, ESI†).

(b and c) Plots of PL intensity (b) and PL peak position (c) versus time. (d) Schematic illustration of the adequate anion exchange stage. 
As discussed above, during the entire anion exchange process, we cannot find significant PL quenching before anion exchange, indicating the PNC have not been decomposed. Therefore, our results disagree with the lattice disintegration and reconstruction model shown in Fig. 1a. In order to better understand the third stage, the schematic illustration of anion exchange is shown in Fig. 4d. Light green and red arrows represent the trails of Br anions and I anions in the anion exchange process. In this adequate anion exchange stage, free I ions continue substituting the Br atoms in CsPbBr3, in the meantime both free Br ions in the solution and newly generated Br ions occupy the I vacancies in CsPb(Br0.09/I0.91)3, which is a dynamic process. Since the content of final CsPb(BrxI1−x)3 PNCs increases via conversion from the two parent PNCs, the PL intensity partially recovers (Fig. 4b). The halogen anions can move freely in the solution due to their high ionic conductivity, ensuring the thorough anion exchange between different PNCs.41 Regarding the controversy on formation of inhomogeneous alloy, in our work, two PL peaks are observed, but they are caused by the two parent PNCs. The two PL peaks gradually merge into a single band. During the entire anion exchange process, there is not any splitting of each PL band, suggesting only one emission site in a single PNC without alloyed heterostructure, in consistence with the single-particle result observed by Masuo et al.30
The absorption spectra at different stages of the anion exchange process between CsPbBr3 and CsPb(Br0.09/I0.91)3 PNCs are shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†). At stage 1, two obvious absorption edges locate at about 528 nm and 680 nm, which correspond to CsPbBr3 and CsPb(Br0.09/I0.91)3 PNCs, respectively, indicating that the lattice structures of the two kinds of PNCs are retained during this stage. At stage 2, the absorption edge of 528 nm shifts to about 540 nm, which is consistent with the PL redshift due to the I doping in CsPbBr3. Meanwhile the 680 nm-absorption edge only blue-shifts slightly due to the high defect tolerance.35 At stage 3, a single absorption edge locating at about 640 nm is observed, indicating the two parent PNCs have already converted into the final PNCs. Thus, our model is further supported by the absorption spectra during the anion exchange process.
In order to confirm the wide applicability of our model, more different situations are tested. 0.1 ml CsPbBr3 (0.02 mol l−1) were added into 0.3 ml CsPb(Br0.09/I0.91)3 (0.02 mol l−1) and the dynamic PL variations were recorded. Both mixing order and Br:I atomic ratio are changed. As shown in Fig. 5, the three different stages can be found clearly. Fig. 5a shows stage 1, which clearly presents the photon reabsorption process. The PL peak intensity of CsPbBr3 gradually decreases while the PL intensity of CsPb(Br0.09/I0.91)3 gradually increases without a PL peak position shift. The PL changes shown in Fig. 5b agrees well with the stage 2 in our model. The PL intensity of CsPbBr3 evidently decreases with a distinct red-shift, indicating the initial anion exchange process. Whereas, the PL of CsPb(Br0.09/I0.91)3 only exhibits minor changes. Stage 3 is shown in Fig. 5c, the two PL peaks of the parent PNCs move towards each other. Finally, the two peaks merge into one peak at about 620 nm due to the adequate anion exchange process. In this situation, the final peak locates roughly at the middle between the two initial PL bands. Throughout the entire process, the two bands gradually and continuously change instead of suddenly disappearing, indicating there is no stage of completed lattice disintegration. More examples are shown in Fig. 6. CsPbBr3 and CsPb(Br0.09/I0.91)3 are mixed at molar ratios at 3.55:1, 1.52:1 and 0.37:1 for Fig. 6a, b, and c respectively. As marked, three different stages can be well identified.

Conclusions
In summary, the time-dependent in situ PL spectra during anion exchange reactions between CsPbBr3 and CsPb(Br0.09/I0.91)3 PNCs are systematically investigated. We have demonstrated that the anion exchange includes three different stages, namely photon reabsorption, initial anion exchange, and adequate anion exchange. This model is supported by the TEM, XRD, and absorption results. We also verified that this model is broadly applicable to different situations, ignoring the mixing order or molar ratios between Br and I. This model will add to the growing fundamental understanding of anion exchange reactions between halide perovskites, which is of great interest for their future applications in optoelectronics and photovoltaics.
